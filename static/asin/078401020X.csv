All I will do is give a synopsis of my favorite scenes.The characters were spectacular! I loved seeing Sharon Stone heat up the screen in this movie! To think that Meg Ryan, Ellen Barkin, Kim Bassinger and so many other fine actresses all turned down the role of the decade makes me realize how it was fate that had the part get to Stone. Stone, and only Stone could do this part justice! Wow! She was incredible. She carried the movie in my opinion and Douglas played off of her. Don't get me wrong, Douglas did his fair share. He more than carried his weight in the production, but it really was Stone that got things going! Never have I seen such a beautiful display of chemistry on screen.The Jean Tripplehorne sex scene was absolutely incredible! I know many were turned off by its explicitness, butI feel it conveyed the primal urge that exists between man and woman. Tripplehorne's character acquiesses to the strong male and ends up being dominated by him! (Her Lover/Patient). As Douglas takes Jean Tripplehorne over the couch you realize that you are in for one wild and fantastic storyline!The ending had/was a twist! I won't go into details and/or ruin it for the reader, but suffice to say that you will be terrified and stunned at how the script ends itself!Definately a Five-Star rating!A.

I was about seventeen and the hype surrounding a singular scene had me anticipating a film that was about as trashy and baseless as they come.  I was expecting porn, to be honest, and at seventeen my expectations were not met and I was pretty much let down.  I mean, all that hype over a crotch shot?Seeing this film in my adulthood has certainly paid off, for my expectations and my personal gratifications are different.  I got far more than I bargained for, since the only memory I had of this film was mere apathy.  This last go around I found a film that has not only aged well but has transformed itself into something almost classy; a film that flirts with the edge of seduction and desire but in a way that is transcendent and almost respectable.  In the capable hands of Paul Verhoeven (never thought I'd say that, but this is his wheelhouse), a film with a reputation can and does become something else entirely.This is a clever, tightly woven thrill ride that titillates where necessary and takes the viewer everywhere they desire to go.  Murder and sex are intertwined in a way that blossoms on the screen thanks to the very iconic performance delivered by Sharon Stone; a forcefully delicious mix of mystery and carelessness.  Douglas is a tad underwhelming (or more than that) and some of the details can come off silly at times, but the way that Verhoeven styles this soap opera is just pitch perfect, allowing the audience to forgive the obvious faults.For a film that let me down so hard as a teen, it has fully redeemed itself in my adulthood.",4,Remember when...,1364515200,"03 29, 2013",2013,1596,"['remember', 'when', 'first', 'saw', 'was', 'about', 'seventeen', 'hype', 'surrounding', 'singular', 'scene', 'had', 'anticipating', 'film', 'was', 'trashy', 'baseless', 'come', 'was', 'expecting', 'porn', 'be', 'honest', 'seventeen', 'expectations', 'were', 'not', 'met', 'was', 'pretty', 'much', 'let', 'down', 'mean', 'hype', 'crotch', 'shot', 'Seeing', 'film', 'adulthood', 'certainly', 'paid', 'off', 'expectations', 'personal', 'gratifications', 'are', 'different', 'got', 'far', 'more', 'bargained', 'only', 'memory', 'had', 'film', 'was', 'mere', 'apathy', 'last', 'go', 'found', 'film', 'not', 'only', 'aged', 'well', 'transformed', 'something', 'almost', 'classy', 'film', 'edge', 'seduction', 'desire', 'way', 'transcendent', 'almost', 'respectable', 'capable', 'hands', 'Paul', 'Verhoeven', 'never', 'thought', ""'d"", 'say', 'wheelhouse', 'film', 'reputation', 'can', 'become', 'something', 'else', 'entirely.This', 'clever', 'tightly', 'woven', 'thrill', 'ride', 'where', 'necessary', 'viewer', 'everywhere', 'desire', 'go', 'Murder', 'sex', 'are', 'intertwined', 'way', 'screen', 'thanks', 'very', 'iconic', 'performance', 'delivered', 'Sharon', 'Stone', 'forcefully', 'delicious', 'mix', 'mystery', 'carelessness', 'Douglas', 'tad', 'underwhelming', 'more', 'details', 'can', 'come', 'off', 'silly', 'times', 'way', 'Verhoeven', 'soap', 'opera', 'just', 'pitch', 'perfect', 'allowing', 'audience', 'forgive', 'obvious', 'faults.For', 'film', 'let', 'down', 'so', 'hard', 'teen', 'fully', 'redeemed', 'adulthood']",N/A

To be honest with you, as this was my third time seeing the movie, I made sure to myself that I would observe more closely, and once again, I fail to see anything that's merely controversial. Hell, Lassie Comes Home contained some horribly sickening graphic scenes that should have been the talk of the town. Maybe I am a dumb guy, but I don't think so. Anyway, Sharon Stone got her fifteen minutes fame only because she flashed her beaver for about five seconds. Actually, it was slow enough that blinking won't miss a thing. Besides the shaven part, she finally acted better than she ever did in any film, but it's as good as anyone in a soft core porn flick. Michael Douglas wimped out big time in this one. He was merely a puppet who got to bring out the...rough physical aspect of himself from Fatal Attraction and waltzed into a bad trap. Although it's obviously clear that his character was becoming something that he was not, Michael Douglas looked rather stupid. I thought the film noir quality in Basic Instinct was a good try, and the story wasn't that bad. Yet it's a dumb movie where every piece neatly perfectly falls into together without a problem. That was the irritating thing when following through as everything happens. Worst of all, the movie was long, boring, and almost pointless. It would be nice if a half hour was cut out to ensure tautness. Oh well...it's a good try for Paul Verhoeven. All he can do was keep trying and searching for his identity. I had no doubt in my mind that Catherine Tramell is the real killer, but I feel insulted that the characters in the film were dumb as rocks, being stringed along without critical and rational thinking, thus leading to that manipulative ending. Come on, the visible Catherine Tramell (and confirmed not a stunt double) killed the dude way early from the beginning. Hello!? Anyhow, it didn't matter because I am not going to lose my sleep over it. Surprisingly, given the high level of nudity, it wasn't a sexy picture like 9  Weeks; in fact, the sex scenes were bland. All in all, it would help if Basic Instinct was less boring and more intelligent.

Censorship had cut out some 'offensive' scenes, let some other, much more explicit scenes stay in the movie, and once again reached the result that censorship always leads to: Much more talk about the movie, and many more people rushing to the theaters, than if censorship had just let the movie be.Today, we've seen it all. Nude actresses (and actors!) is the rule rather than the exception to the rule. However, Basic Instinct remains a catching movie! Not because of the so-called explicity.

73236,AXKLJRDTPJCA7,078401020X,Boss Fan,"[126, 142]","I will dispense with the standard plot synopsis and, for the most part, a review of this movie.  14 years later, most of us looking at a special edition ""Basic Instinct"" DVD already like it enough to at least show interest in possibly buying this.  My question was, is it worth it to replace my old ""Basic Instinct"" DVD with a new one?By my count this is the 4th DVD transfer of this film (there was a bare-bones DVD of the theatrical release, then a special edition with extras, then the unrated directors cut special edition with the same extras (that one had the dumb ""ice pick box,"" but was eventually, and is now, available in a standard box whose cover art looks just like all the other releases (including the original VHS release):  All white box, torso-and-up shot of Stone and Douglas whith her clawing his back), and now this one that still retains that same image of the stars, but now it is inside the lettering of the title).I mention this for two reasons.The first may not matter much to amazon and other on-line shoppers, but here's what happened to me while walking around Best Buy today:  I already owned the ""bare-bones"" version (I picked it up for 5 bucks brand new at least 5 years ago, so this has never been a movie one needed to drop a lot on to own), but I wanted the unrated director's cut I saw advertised in the Best Buy weekend circular.  I picked it up off the shelf and saw there was the older '02 special edition release right next to it for $5.99.  I was not crazy about spending $15 (not that that is a terrible price, mind you) on a movie I already owned so I decided to go with the '02 version (I'll get to the comparison between the two in a moment - that is reason #2).  I got home and found out it was the special edition alright, but it was the original theatrical version.  It had extras and such, but the point of replacing the thing in the first place was to get the director's cut.  So I went back to Best Buy and, sure enough, because the boxes look the same except for a tiny-worded ""director's cut"" in the bottom corner, I grabbed the wrong one.  The director's cut was there and it to was also only $5.99 (and because of some additional sale I was unaware of it rang up as something like $4.40).  So BE CAREFULl WHEN SELECTING A VERSION OF THE FILM. The ice-pick box, dumb as it looked on the DVD shelf, seems to be gone so there is no easy way to tell all these apart.  You gotta do a little reading.  ""Special Edition"" doesn't automaticly mean ""director's cut."" (Especially for a DVD that has had as many similar - and similar looking - releases as this one.)That's my first point.  The second is to inform you that, in comparing this new version ""special edition director's cut"" with the $5 version I got, the only difference, besides the newly arranged cover art, is that there is an interview and an introduction by Sharon Stone.  That's it.  Other than that, it has the same bonuses, commentaries, etc.  And that is said if that even matters to you in the first place.  If you just want the movie, there is no reason to opt for this new, more expensice release; or if you already have the director's cut, replace it with this one - unless you really want to hear from Sharon Stone (that's her now, mind you, not 1992 - I'm just sayin'...)So why was this made then?  ""Basic Instinct 2"" hits theatres in a few weeks. I'll reserve judgment on that move until I see it, but I can judge this as a cash grab.  I'm not angry though.  ""Basic Instinct"" is hardly the first film to pull this stunt and I almost wish that some of the movies I really loved had just one ""special edition"" or update from its first DVD incarnation, not to mention 4 or more.  I would just hope there would be something that sets them apart from the previous version.That's not the case here.* One quick observation I could not resisit mentioning:  It is ironic that a movie as notorious for its graphic sex and violence as ""Basic Instinct"" that the Amazon info lists its rating as simply ""Unrated for drug use and laguage.""  :)",3,Hollywood's most 'basic instinct' = CASH GRAB.,1142294400,"03 14, 2006",2006,4050,"['will', 'dispense', 'standard', 'plot', 'synopsis', 'most', 'part', 'review', 'movie', '14', 'years', 'later', 'most', 'looking', 'special', 'edition', 'Basic', 'Instinct', 'DVD', 'already', 'enough', 'least', 'show', 'interest', 'possibly', 'buying', 'question', 'was', 'replace', 'old', 'Basic', 'Instinct', 'DVD', 'new', 'one', 'count', '4th', 'DVD', 'transfer', 'film', 'was', 'bare-bones', 'DVD', 'theatrical', 'release', 'then', 'special', 'edition', 'extras', 'then', 'unrated', 'directors', 'cut', 'special', 'edition', 'same', 'extras', 'one', 'had', 'dumb', 'ice', 'pick', 'box', 'was', 'eventually', 'now', 'available', 'standard', 'box', 'cover', 'art', 'just', 'other', 'releases', 'including', 'original', 'VHS', 'release', 'white', 'box', 'torso-and-up', 'shot', 'Stone', 'Douglas', 'whith', 'clawing', 'back', 'now', 'one', 'still', 'same', 'image', 'stars', 'now', 'lettering', 'title', 'mention', 'two', 'reasons.The', 'first', 'may', 'not', 'matter', 'much', 'amazon', 'other', 'on-line', 'shoppers', 'here', 'what', 'happened', 'walking', 'around', 'Best', 'Buy', 'today', 'already', 'owned', 'bare-bones', 'version', 'picked', 'up', '5', 'bucks', 'brand', 'new', 'least', '5', 'years', 'ago', 'never', 'been', 'movie', 'one', 'needed', 'drop', 'lot', 'own', 'wanted', 'unrated', 'director', 'cut', 'saw', 'advertised', 'Best', 'Buy', 'weekend', 'circular', 'picked', 'up', 'shelf', 'saw', 'was', 'older', 'special', 'edition', 'release', 'right', 'next', '5.99', 'was', 'not', 'crazy', 'spending', '15', 'not', 'terrible', 'price', 'movie', 'already', 'owned', 'so', 'decided', 'go', ""'02"", 'version', ""'ll"", 'get', 'comparison', 'two', 'moment', 'reason', '2', 'got', 'home', 'found', 'was', 'special', 'edition', 'alright', 'was', 'original', 'theatrical', 'version', 'had', 'extras', 'such', 'point', 'replacing', 'thing', 'first', 'place', 'was', 'get', 'director', 'cut', 'So', 'went', 'back', 'Best', 'Buy', 'sure', 'enough', 'boxes', 'look', 'same', 'tiny-worded', 'director', 'cut', 'bottom', 'corner', 'grabbed', 'wrong', 'one', 'director', 'cut', 'was', 'there', 'was', 'also', 'only', '5.99', 'additional', 'sale', 'was', 'unaware', 'up', 'something', '4.40', 'So', 'BE', 'CAREFULl', 'WHEN', 'SELECTING', 'A', 'VERSION', 'THE', 'FILM', 'ice-pick', 'box', 'dumb', 'looked', 'DVD', 'shelf', 'be', 'gone', 'so', 'easy', 'way', 'tell', 'apart', 'got', 'ta', 'do', 'little', 'reading', 'Special', 'Edition', ""n't"", 'automaticly', 'mean', 'director', 'cut', 'Especially', 'DVD', 'had', 'many', 'similar', 'similar', 'looking', 'releases', 'one', 'first', 'point', 'second', 'inform', 'comparing', 'new', 'version', 'special', 'edition', 'director', 'cut', '5', 'version', 'got', 'only', 'difference', 'newly', 'arranged', 'cover', 'art', 'interview', 'introduction', 'Sharon', 'Stone', 'Other', 'same', 'bonuses', 'commentaries', 'etc', 'said', 'even', 'matters', 'first', 'place', 'just', 'want', 'movie', 'reason', 'opt', 'new', 'more', 'expensice', 'release', 'already', 'have', 'director', 'cut', 'replace', 'one', 'really', 'want', 'hear', 'Sharon', 'Stone', 'now', 'mind', 'not', '1992', ""'m"", 'just', 'sayin', 'So', 'why', 'was', 'made', 'then', 'Basic', 'Instinct', '2', 'hits', 'theatres', 'few', 'weeks', ""'ll"", 'reserve', 'judgment', 'move', 'see', 'can', 'judge', 'cash', 'grab', ""'m"", 'not', 'angry', 'Basic', 'Instinct', 'hardly', 'first', 'film', 'pull', 'stunt', 'almost', 'wish', 'movies', 'really', 'loved', 'had', 'just', 'one', 'special', 'edition', 'update', 'first', 'DVD', 'incarnation', 'not', 'mention', '4', 'more', 'would', 'just', 'hope', 'would', 'be', 'something', 'apart', 'previous', 'version.That', 'not', 'case', 'here', '*', 'One', 'quick', 'observation', 'could', 'not', 'resisit', 'mentioning', 'ironic', 'movie', 'notorious', 'graphic', 'sex', 'violence', 'Basic', 'Instinct', 'Amazon', 'info', 'rating', 'simply', 'Unrated', 'drug', 'use', 'laguage']",N/A

73242,A1JCWK43MAGZIG,078401020X,"By Definition ""By Definition""","[5, 5]","Paul Verhoeven and Joe Eszterhas open their film with the ultimate oxymoron of love and death: the moment of orgasm coincides with the moment of greatest agony and death. Never before has a film character been killed in the throes of orgasm. Never before has such a wildly creative and controversial opening polarized audience opinion from scene one. Never before has orgasm on film achieved such a scary, cynical, darkly humorous edge with each counter-penetration of the murder weapon. The very concept of doing away with a victim in this way in the first minutes of the film demonstrates the creators' genius -- and their ""poor"" taste.But this is only the beginning of a delightfully ironic, even amusing, dance between life and death that forms the twists and turns of Basic Instinct.Aside from analyzing a film from the infantile and simple-minded level of sex and violence, a great film achieves emotional intensity also with it's carefully photographed and edited ""looks"", scenes in which the characters glance at each other in fits of non-verbal communication - and Basic Instinct scores 200 percent in this department. Achieved by Verhoeven, cinematographer Jan De Bont, and the cast itself, the ""looks"" achieve a particularly fine edge when Curran and Gus first encounter Roxy in the ""his and hers Picassos"" scene in the foyer, and then later Verhoeven and cast up the ante again in the oceanside scene on the deck in which Curran, Gus, and Trammell first encounter each other. The cutting and film score in this area are so beautiful it hurts. This is surely Jerry Goldsmith's finest score, whose power throughout the production is inestimable.Non-verbal looks are key, and looks mixed with Joe Eszterhas' now-famous dialogue make Basic Instinct a film so coherent and so vital, so crackling with delicious character friction, that Basic Instinct is absolutely perfect - at least up until the violent sex scene between Curran and his psychotherapist, which I thought was unnecessary, but which adds a needed touch of lunacy to Curran's and Garner's relationship. The fact that this relationship is openly discussed in the department provides the final touch of contradiction and astringency.A great film stimulates all parts of the mind simultaneously, from the most intellectual to the most primal, and Basic Instinct covers the entire spectrum, providing doses of gore, emotionally satisfying character interaction, and intellectually stimulating plot.Basic Instinct is chock full of classic and memorable scenes, but most of the sex and violence scenes are definitely off the list. Verhoeven has to do it tastefully and artfully, of course. No missteps here. But who cares how well they can make love or stab each other? It's the stuff in between the violence, the fantastic interactions and pithy dialogue of one of the best film casts ever assembled, that makes Basic Instinct so great. Particularly notable and satisfying is the scene with Dr. Lamott, Dr. Garner and the entire police staff, which hones in on the ambiguity and insanity of the film's basic themes, with brilliant support again from Goldsmith's underscore.Basic Instinct is the peak of Michael Douglas' career - and Sharon Stone's, for that matter. Aside from Douglas' artfully chiseled expressions, let's not forget that fabulous voice. Douglas is simply incredible, and I have never enjoyed so much seeing a lead character attacked by everyone else in the cast, especially his own people.Note a particularly underrated performance by Denis Arndt as Lieutenant Walker, Curran's immediate supervisor, who provides a deliciously acrid and sardonic non-supportiveness for Curran's ongoing investigation.If characters like Curran and Walker irritate, then Stone as Trammell is the ultimate lubricant, nothing sticks to her, she can easily wriggle out of any situation. Basic Instinct dares to portray an invincible murderer with no guilt, no weaknesses, who as antagonist overcomes Curran by seduction.I would like to finally touch upon Jan De Bont's gorgeous, smooth camera moves, which used in conjunction with long, unbroken, multi-character dialogue shots loaded with camera movement, elevate the European style and make this one of the most visually pleasurable films to watch ever made, just in terms of pure camera movement. The interplay of camera and actors is electrifying in it's vitality. I really enjoyed verhoeven's and De Bont's commentary track on the Blu Ray.In it's craft alone, Basic Instinct goes far beyond the average thriller to become the ultimate modern whodunit against which all others must be measured.

73243,A2PBV1899CX3TE,078401020X,"C. CRADDOCK ""Cr@$#!!!!""","[1, 3]","Basic Instinct is a basic geometric triangle, and while, as in basic math, the square of the hypotenuse is equal to the sum of the square of the two adjacent sides, all of the sides are important, and basically, with Michael Douglas, Sharon Stone, and Jeanne Triplehorn, you can't lose.Jeanne Triplehorn is from Oklahoma. She has been described as having an incredibly open face and a devastating glare. Her father, Tom Triplehorn, played guitar for Gary & the Pacemakers on such hits as ""This Diamond Ring Doesn't Shine For You Anymore."" Working with Michael Douglas as the 2nd Lead in Basic Instinct led to Ms. Triplehorn's chance to portray Tom Cruise's wife in the box-office smash The Firm (1993). Her clever work in this film afforded her the opportunity to work opposite other ""top guns"" in the industry, including Kevin Costner in the futuristic epic flop Waterworld (1995), Gwyneth Paltrow in the experiment-gone-wrong Sliding Doors (1998) and Hugh Grant in the preposterous Mickey Blue Eyes (1999). Though Triplehorn couldn't rescue these Kamikaze missions from certain disaster, her performance in Basic Instinct as the bespectacled psychiatrist Dr. Beth Garner garnered my attention.Michael Douglas and Sharon Stone are so well known that I scarcely need to go into their biographies. Michael was the son of well known, well liked actor Kirk Douglas. He didn't want any of his sons to ply the acting profession, so he never gave Michael so much as a 'foot in the door.' He first got the public's attention playing a cop opposite veteran actor Karl Malden in 'The Streets of San Francisco.' [shot on location in San Francisco, it is fun to watch re-runs for the superb location shots alone]. TV led to films, but it was Basic Instinct that catapulted Douglas to household name status. Other notable roles were Fatal Attraction and Wall Street.Stone was also catapulted into the limelight from the success of Basic Instinct, but fell from grace with Sliver and a slew of slim pickings until finally getting respect and redemption in Casino with Robert De Niro, an Oscar nomination, thank you. Sharon has had some ups, with Basic Instinct, Casino, The Muse, The Quick and the Dead, The Mighty, and Bobby; but others, such as Sliver, Diabolique, Intersection, The Specialist, Catwoman, Allan Quatermain and the Lost City of Gold, and the sequel-that-never-should-have-been, Basic Instinct 2, basically sunk like a... well, Stone.I have a basic theory about Joe Eszterhas. His career was in a tailspin after Sliver, Showgirls, and Jade, so he went down in flames with An Alan Smithee Film: Burn Hollywood Burn. Anyone familiar with the name Alan Smithee knows that it is the name a director attaches to a film that he wants nothing more to do with. This film not only capped a string of bad reviews for his writing, it added one for his acting, playing himself for goodness sake, he was such a bad actor he couldn't even effectively portray himself. Besides that, it was a kind of vendetta against Hollywood, and all he had suffered there. I think that Flashdance was brilliant, for a movie about a welder/stripper who wants to go to ballet school, and I would like to see Jagged Edge. Basic Instinct might be the pinnacle of his achievement. You know you are being manipulated with trashy, exploitive garbage, but like Wayne Knight (Newman from Seinfeld) and the other cops in the famous scene in the interrogation room, you don't care. After his apotheosis with Basic Instinct, he slid down the slippery slope with Sliver, Showgirls, Jade, and finally, to kill his career once and for all, An Alan Smithee Film: Burn Hollywood Burn.I find it interesting that Sharon Stone plays a sociopathic writer in Basic Instinct, and contend that Eszterhas was drawing from personal experience in that regard. At one point Catherine Tramell (Sharon Stone) reveals the finer points of her craft, where she asserts that writing teaches you how to lie. She utilizes that skill in beating a polygraph. I find this very telling, Mr. Eszterhas.Though I remember Spetters, I doubt that many other people do. It was a charming foreign film about motorcycle racing, as I recall. Total Recall was totally an Arnold Swarzeneger vehicle supposedly based on the writing of Philip K. Dick, but it came up surprisingly dickless. Robocop, though I personally didn't see it, it was so popular that I remember it nevertheless. Basic Instinct seems to be the high water mark for Verhoeven as well, but his next outing with Eszterhas resulted in Showgirls--not a brilliant career move for either one.Take these actors, this writer, and this director, mix them together in a pot boiler like Basic Instinct, and voila! I liked the way Catherine Tramell knew how to exploit Nick Curran's weaknesses: cigarettes, cocaine, booze, sex, violence--if she could awaken his craving for one, it would lead to the others. All the while, he thought he was solving the case, and that proved to be his biggest weakness of all. Thinking he could out think Tramell in this cat-and-mouse game, where he thinks he's the cat, but he is nothing but a mouse.Though I admit that Basic Instinct was a great film, it remains a guilty pleasure, and though I was entertained, I resent being manipulated in such a trashy and exploitive way. So I will shed no tears for the fall of Eszterhas.JOE ESZTERHASBasic Instinct 2 (2006) (characters)Alan Smithee Film: Burn Hollywood Burn(1998) (written by)Telling Lies in America (1997) (written by)Jade(1995) (written by) (1995) (written by)Showgirls (Fully Exposed Edition)Sliver (Unrated Edition)(1993) (screenplay)Basic Instinct (1992) (written by)Music Box (1989) (written by)Checking Out (1989) (written by)Betrayed (1988) (written by)Big Shots (1987) (written by)Hearts of Fire (1987) (screenplay)Jagged Edge (1985) (written by)Flashdance (Special Collector's Edition w/ Bonus CD)screenplay)  (1983)F.I.S.T (1978) (screenplay) (story)PAUL VERHOEVENStarship Troopers (1997)Showgirls (1995)Basic Instinct (1992)Total Recall (1990)RoboCop (1987)Flesh+Blood (1985)Vierde man, De (1983)Spetters (Widescreen Edition)(1980)SHARON STONEWhen a Man Falls in the Forest (2007) ....

And of course we always hum their respective themes, whether we're going after someone in a pool/lake or making a stabbing motion with that irritating-but-effective high pitched Psycho theme. Well add silk scarves and icepicks to the list.Detective Nick Curran is investigating a case of an old rocker killed in bed while tied up and repeatedly stabbed. Their trail leads them to his ""girlfriend""(a.k.a a **** buddy) Catherine Tramell, a novelist. Interestingly, a character in one of her books is killed in the precise manner as the rocker. So is someone framing her, or does she know that people would think she's nuts for killing someone in the exact way she wrote it obviously naming her the killer?Then Nick starts to get obsessed. The sexually charged presense of Catherine affects him, making him smoke in non-smoking buildings and even having rough sex with his girlfriend. He also has to deal with Catherine's girlfriend(and not in the ""girl and she's a friend"")Roxie, who's quite jealous. So the question becomes is Nick dating the killer he's looking for? Or is Catherine's lover a little too obsessive?The film was extremely controversial when it first came out. Not only for the sex filled narrative but also the ""treatment"" of gay and lesbians. Some gays and lesbians aren't crazy? We're not always that idealic view that we have. In a special feature on the Desperate Housewives set, Felicity Huffman recalls the scene where a woman asks ""isn't it great being a mom?"" Well yeah if you don't factor in the sleepless nights, frantic running around and calling for babysitters and housework. Same idea here. Sure Roxie is slightly off and a bit obsessive but isn't some of them? Like Norman Bates said, we all go a little mad sometimes.Now the sex in the film is never explicit. We don't see anything that'd get the film NC-17 but it sure implies a lot. We got implied oral on male and female, standard positions, tons of nudity and even some girl-on-girl lesbian kissing(sorry guys, no love scene with those 2). The unrated version just merely extends shots by a few seconds or changes the camera angle, such as Nick and Catherine's first sexual encounter.As for extra features they're not bad, including one feature that shows what was cut out(which really needs to be implemented more in these unrated editions). The commentaries are ok except you might find famed feminist author Camille Paglia a bit irritating since she's so university-lecture and overemphazing things. For example here's something she mentions about the interrogation scene: ""The intensity of looking in this scene, looking on the part of the men, on Catherine's part, on our part, raises the temperature in the scene. There's a kind of sadism as Catherine plays with her prey. There's a kind of evocation of great movies about St. Joan, where in this case, the perverse saint, a Mary Magdalene figure, is defying her interrogators.""

73249,A2DB22MRLKXUT4,078401020X,"Collin O'Donnell ""HAL 9000""","[0, 0]","Basic Instinct is far-and-away the best porno ever made. Judging it as a normal film, it is probably one of the best psychosexual thrillers ever made. If Alfred Hitchcock wasn't burdened by the stuffy censors, Basic Instinct is undoubtedly the kind of tawdry mystery he would have liked to direct, Frenzy being as far as he's ever pushed the envelope. Paul Verhoeven, however, presented to the MPAA what may have been the most sexually explicit wide-release film at the time, and he took great pride in it. Basic Instinct is about manipulation. Catherine Tramell, a wealthy, seductive writer, uses people in real life as models for her characters, and 'gets rid of them' when they are no longer useful to her. As writers are manipulators of the worlds they create, Catherine practices her manipulation on living people and has the power to control her surroundings through the sheer force of her sexuality, like they were pawns in her overly-complex chess game. Nick Curran, a renegade cop, just happens to fall into her deadly web and becomes the protagonist of her new novel. Basic Instinct is a mystery through and through. Although the last shot seems to indicate a clear killer, ambiguity still runs rampant in it's mirky and purposefully spotty storytelling. At one point, Tramell says something to this effect: &#34;I'll only tell you what I want you to know and no more.&#34; This seems very much the attitude of Joe Eszterhas, the screenwriter. The rich and interpretational writing is what makes Basic Instinct so seductive from the audience's perspective. That or the over-abundance of nudity or sexual content. Sharon Stone as Catherine Tramell is nothing short of iconic. She nails the role of a provocative vixen with a calculating brain eerily well. The way her femme fatale lures those around her is so believable, mainly because the audience also succumbs and falls for her temptations. The chemistry between her and Michael Douglas is absolutely electric. Watching Douglas transform from a recovering drug abuser whose life is on the upswing to a puppet of the lowest order is almost devastating to watch. Jeanne Tripplehorn is equally as sexy as Stone, yet her more submissive female personality gives balance to a film that is otherwise hopelessly feminist. A big congrats to Paul Verhoeven for having the courage to push that envelope to its breaking point. Basic Instinct may be more well known for the sex scenes or the infamous 'interrogation scene', but Verhoeven still succeeded in making an involving thriller that stays with the viewer long after the credits.",5,Blood and Steam,1402358400,"06 10, 2014",2014,2587,"['Basic', 'Instinct', 'far-and-away', 'best', 'porno', 'ever', 'made', 'Judging', 'normal', 'film', 'probably', 'one', 'best', 'psychosexual', 'thrillers', 'ever', 'made', 'Alfred', 'Hitchcock', 'was', ""n't"", 'burdened', 'stuffy', 'censors', 'Basic', 'Instinct', 'undoubtedly', 'kind', 'tawdry', 'mystery', 'would', 'have', 'liked', 'direct', 'Frenzy', 'being', 'as', 'far', 'ever', 'pushed', 'envelope', 'Paul', 'Verhoeven', 'however', 'presented', 'MPAA', 'what', 'may', 'have', 'been', 'most', 'sexually', 'explicit', 'wide-release', 'film', 'time', 'took', 'great', 'pride', 'Basic', 'Instinct', 'manipulation', 'Catherine', 'Tramell', 'wealthy', 'seductive', 'writer', 'people', 'real', 'life', 'models', 'characters', 'rid', 'when', 'are', 'no', 'longer', 'useful', 'writers', 'are', 'manipulators', 'worlds', 'create', 'Catherine', 'practices', 'manipulation', 'living', 'people', 'power', 'control', 'surroundings', 'sheer', 'force', 'sexuality', 'were', 'pawns', 'overly-complex', 'chess', 'game', 'Nick', 'Curran', 'renegade', 'cop', 'just', 'fall', 'deadly', 'web', 'protagonist', 'new', 'novel', 'Basic', 'Instinct', 'mystery', 'last', 'shot', 'indicate', 'clear', 'killer', 'ambiguity', 'still', 'rampant', 'mirky', 'purposefully', 'spotty', 'storytelling', 'one', 'point', 'Tramell', 'something', 'effect', '34', ""'ll"", 'only', 'tell', 'what', 'want', 'know', 'more.', '34', 'very', 'much', 'attitude', 'Joe', 'Eszterhas', 'screenwriter', 'rich', 'interpretational', 'writing', 'what', 'Basic', 'Instinct', 'so', 'seductive', 'audience', 'perspective', 'over-abundance', 'nudity', 'sexual', 'content', 'Sharon', 'Stone', 'Catherine', 'Tramell', 'nothing', 'short', 'iconic', 'role', 'provocative', 'vixen', 'calculating', 'brain', 'eerily', 'well', 'way', 'femme', 'fatale', 'lures', 'so', 'believable', 'mainly', 'audience', 'also', 'temptations', 'chemistry', 'Michael', 'Douglas', 'absolutely', 'electric', 'Watching', 'Douglas', 'transform', 'recovering', 'drug', 'abuser', 'life', 'upswing', 'puppet', 'lowest', 'order', 'almost', 'devastating', 'watch', 'Jeanne', 'Tripplehorn', 'equally', 'as', 'sexy', 'Stone', 'yet', 'more', 'submissive', 'female', 'personality', 'balance', 'film', 'otherwise', 'hopelessly', 'feminist', 'big', 'congrats', 'Paul', 'Verhoeven', 'having', 'courage', 'push', 'envelope', 'breaking', 'point', 'Basic', 'Instinct', 'may', 'be', 'more', 'well', 'known', 'sex', 'scenes', 'infamous', ""'interrogation"", 'scene', 'Verhoeven', 'still', 'succeeded', 'making', 'involving', 'thriller', 'viewer', 'long', 'credits']",N/A

What is it about this guy that attracts obsessive, psychopathic women?  Moreover, how does he manage to fall for these women and make it so believable?  BASIC INSTINCT is a very sexually-charged thriller.  The plot is relatively simple: we know from the beginning that there is something not right about Catherine, Sharon Stone's character.  The opening of the film finds her as the prime suspect in a brutal killing, an indictment that is made all the more believable by the graphic/nude murder scene in which we see the muderer's naked body.  Let's just say, we've seen that body before.Thus, I spent most of the movie trying to figure out how the whole thing was going to flop on me.  I waited for the twist that would send me down a different path.  Unfortunately, the twists never occurred.  Instead, we get launched a huge assortment of facts and evidence that can be read in several different ways.  It isn't until the final scene that we learn the truth.  I'm not going to give it away, but I think the movie would have been better without the final shot.  If you're going to jerk around with the audience for two hours, you might as well leave them with their thoughts.Overall, BASIC INSTINCT is just an okay thriller.  I did not truly feel the suspense in this film.  What little suspense there is dissolves into erotic passion.  There is plenty of THAT in the film.  Who could forget the famous ""leg uncrossing scene"" that forever enshrined Sharon Stone in our memories (and hearts).  But as for suspense, aside from some graphic violence, I wasn't on the edge of my seat.One thing that I did enjoy in this film was watching the transformation of Michael Douglas's character.  Both he and Stone light up the screen and manage to make something out of this average film.  If you enjoy thrillers about femme fatales, then you have to watch this film.

73256,ABN5K7K1TM1QA,078401020X,Dennis Littrell,"[5, 7]","We might call this trash, but if we do we'd have to call it very clever trash, the sort of trash one might find dumpster-diving in Beverly Hills.It stars Michael Douglas (who, by the way, has eclipsed the Hollywood power, if not the screen presence, of his dad, Kurt Douglas) and Sharon Stone who, as usual, finds herself in a part that requires that she take off her clothes and spout hard-edged one-liners: she does both with a certain delight that makes us think she is having a good time.He's a San Francisco homicide cop named Nick Curran with some questionable shootings hanging over his head, hence his nickname, ""Shooter.""  She's a rich best-selling trash novelist named Catherine Tramell (pen name Catherine Wolfe) who likes kinky sex and other deviancies.  It seems that her latest boyfriend (depicted in a blood-splattered opening scene) abruptly, shall we say, met his maker while in the arms of Venus, something predicted in Catherine's latest opus.  We are made to believe that she could very well have been that Venus, although of course keeping us in the dark is part of the seduction.Jeanne Tripplehorn plays Beth Garner, police Internal Affairs shrink who just happens to be Nick's latest main squeeze.  It seems that Catherine and Beth had a one-time intimate liaison while undergrads at UC Berkeley.  We are led to believe that she too might have done the killings.So Nick has a choice, whom to believe about who's responsible for all the dead bodies, the blonde Catherine or the brunette Beth?  Both seem a little wacko/sexy.  He tries them both out, and we see a lot of skin and hear a lot of fast breathing, and are kept on the edge of our whoopee cushions until the very end--and after, actually, as though the purveyors were already counting on the sequel.  I am reminded of a lyric from Elvis Costello's ""Everyday I write the book"": ""Even in a world where everyone was equal/I'd still own the film rights and be working on the sequel.""In other words, what this film is about is money--money for the producers, director, actors, crew, etc.  It's an extreme sexploitation thriller diabolically done with absurd plot twists and plenty of dead bodies and some diverting chase scenes (did I mention sex?); indeed I suspect that Basic Instinct will be recognized by future film historians as one of the primo examples of the sex/slasher genre, that is, as soft porn with a sick edge.But wait, why did I watch this?  Uh...Sharon Stone amuses me like a comedic actress, but she ain't exactly funny, is she?Also it's interesting to notice that in these late eighties/early nineties sexploitation flicks it's the women who are the aggressors (I'm thinking also of Single White Female from the same year) while the men play a little tagalong.  Michael Douglas is particularly adept at playing the sort of male who seems natural being dominated by Sharon Stone.Bottom line: mass mind trash, but worth seeing for its ability to define the Hollywood mentality circa 1992.",3,Near the apex of the sex/slasher genre,1088121600,"06 25, 2004",2004,2983,"['might', 'call', 'trash', 'do', ""'d"", 'have', 'call', 'very', 'clever', 'trash', 'sort', 'trash', 'one', 'might', 'find', 'dumpster-diving', 'Beverly', 'Hills.It', 'Michael', 'Douglas', 'who', 'way', 'eclipsed', 'Hollywood', 'power', 'not', 'screen', 'presence', 'dad', 'Kurt', 'Douglas', 'Sharon', 'Stone', 'who', 'usual', 'part', 'take', 'off', 'clothes', 'spout', 'hard-edged', 'one-liners', 'certain', 'delight', 'think', 'having', 'good', 'time.He', 'San', 'Francisco', 'homicide', 'cop', 'named', 'Nick', 'Curran', 'questionable', 'shootings', 'hanging', 'head', 'hence', 'nickname', 'Shooter', 'rich', 'best-selling', 'trash', 'novelist', 'named', 'Catherine', 'Tramell', 'pen', 'name', 'Catherine', 'Wolfe', 'who', 'kinky', 'sex', 'other', 'deviancies', 'latest', 'boyfriend', 'depicted', 'blood-splattered', 'opening', 'scene', 'abruptly', 'shall', 'say', 'met', 'maker', 'arms', 'Venus', 'something', 'predicted', 'Catherine', 'latest', 'opus', 'are', 'made', 'believe', 'could', 'very', 'well', 'have', 'been', 'Venus', 'course', 'keeping', 'dark', 'part', 'seduction.Jeanne', 'Tripplehorn', 'Beth', 'Garner', 'police', 'Internal', 'Affairs', 'shrink', 'who', 'just', 'be', 'Nick', 'latest', 'main', 'squeeze', 'Catherine', 'Beth', 'had', 'one-time', 'intimate', 'liaison', 'undergrads', 'UC', 'Berkeley', 'are', 'led', 'believe', 'too', 'might', 'have', 'done', 'killings.So', 'Nick', 'choice', 'whom', 'believe', 'who', 'responsible', 'dead', 'bodies', 'blonde', 'Catherine', 'brunette', 'Beth', 'Both', 'seem', 'little', 'wacko/sexy', 'see', 'lot', 'skin', 'hear', 'lot', 'fast', 'breathing', 'are', 'kept', 'edge', 'whoopee', 'cushions', 'very', 'end', 'actually', 'purveyors', 'were', 'already', 'counting', 'sequel', 'am', 'reminded', 'lyric', 'Elvis', 'Costello', 'Everyday', 'write', 'book', 'Even', 'world', 'where', 'everyone', 'was', 'equal/I', ""'d"", 'still', 'own', 'film', 'rights', 'be', 'working', 'sequel', 'other', 'words', 'what', 'film', 'about', 'money', 'money', 'producers', 'director', 'actors', 'crew', 'etc', 'extreme', 'sexploitation', 'thriller', 'diabolically', 'done', 'absurd', 'plot', 'twists', 'plenty', 'dead', 'bodies', 'diverting', 'chase', 'scenes', 'did', 'mention', 'sex', 'indeed', 'suspect', 'Basic', 'Instinct', 'will', 'be', 'recognized', 'future', 'film', 'historians', 'one', 'primo', 'examples', 'sex/slasher', 'genre', 'soft', 'porn', 'sick', 'edge.But', 'wait', 'why', 'did', 'watch', 'Uh', 'Sharon', 'Stone', 'comedic', 'actress', 'ai', ""n't"", 'exactly', 'funny', 'Also', 'interesting', 'notice', 'late', 'eighties/early', 'nineties', 'sexploitation', 'women', 'who', 'are', 'aggressors', ""'m"", 'thinking', 'also', 'Single', 'White', 'Female', 'same', 'year', 'men', 'play', 'little', 'tagalong', 'Michael', 'Douglas', 'particularly', 'adept', 'playing', 'sort', 'male', 'who', 'natural', 'being', 'dominated', 'Sharon', 'Stone.Bottom', 'line', 'mass', 'mind', 'trash', 'worth', 'seeing', 'ability', 'define', 'Hollywood', 'mentality', 'circa', '1992']",N/A
73257,A3PCTD8QM1BIXI,078401020X,"Derrick Dunn ""The Realest DJ""","[3, 3]","Paul Verhoeven has created a masterwork from Joe Eszterhas' controversial script. Several sex scenes become a leitmotif, as the participants appear to pummel, rather than love, one another with their nether parts. But the most rugged and the most erotic scene occurs between Detective Nick Curran, Michael Douglas, and his colleague, Beth Garner, portrayed by Jeanne Tripplehorn. He throws her against a wall and then against the back of a chesterfield. That is only the foreplay. In this film sex is violence, and that is Verhoeven's theme.But there is more. Sharon Stone as Catherine Tramell has a beautiful blonde form in that Beach Boy / California girl manner. She plays her 'flashing' scene in the police interrogation room with wit and a touch of class. Throughout the film she is arch, intelligent, electric. Her foil, Nick Curran, a troubled detective, realizes she might be a murderer, but finds her personality and her allure, irresistible. Douglas' performance is driven, masculine, affecting ... yet he would be well advised to keep his trousers on henceforth, for his sagging bottom is simply too comical.There are several echoes of Alfred Hitchcock's Vertigo (58). Both pictures have as a setting the picturesque San Francisco area. Jerry Goldsmith's music recalls Bernard Herrmann's symphonic score. The stairwell in Curran's apartment building resembles the vertiginous staircase of the Mission bell tower. And as with Hitchcock the dialogue is often simultaneously risque and humorous, although more vulgar in keeping with the tenor of modern times.Eszterhas' script is carefully crafted, and it does not cheat. Life proves ambiguous at many levels, and so does art. The mystery is dark; the action, including a car chase, thrills; and the locale continually shifts, from a cop station to Catherine's lovely seaside house to a colorful bar where Catherine's jealous female lover and Curran engage in a sensual battle for her charms.Day, night, sun, rain, streets, highways, scenery, ocean, sex, emotion, confrontations, death ... the film envelops everything, perhaps even love.

73259,A2198FZZMTJ38H,078401020X,D. Litton,"[4, 10]","I'll get over the formalities and cut right to the chase: &quot;Basic Instinct&quot; has some great acting by a wonderful cast, and a conceivably good story, but in the hands of director Paul Verhoeven, who is well-known for his use of style over substance, the mystery and psychological inklings fall increasingly short of suspenseful, leading us up to twist after twist, some of which work, others that founder. His sense of direction is in the right place, but the way in which he takes us where he wants us to go is surprisingly joyless, and without intensity.The film begins, fittingly enough, with a sex scene, in which a former rock star, who is now a prestigious community member in San Francisco, is murdered with an ice pick after intercourse by an unseen blonde woman. This brings detective Nick Curran (Michael Douglas) to the attention of the sultry author Catherine Tramell (Sharon Stone), who was last seen with the murder victim. It also doesn't help that the murder is an exact reenactment of a similar event in one of her novels.At first, Curran seems turned off by Tramell's forthrightness in her testimony of her relationship with the victim, and is certain that a lie detector test that proves her innocent is wrong. But as he begins to dig his nails into clues, he also finds himself mesmerized by her, and by the danger he feels in playing head games with her as she does with him. His life begins to take a nose dive: he begins smoking and drinking again, and becomes so infatuated with Tramell that he becomes even more determined to prove her innocent.So does all of this really work? Some elements do, such as the wonderful acting and sometimes witty dialogue exchanges, but others, such as ambiguous clues and lurid sex scenes, do not. The movie is worth it to see the terrific talents of its cast, but take them out of the equation, and what you have is a skin flick spiced up with a Hollywood makeover.The movie's two main stars are its central attractions, featuring some very effective work from Michael Douglas and Sharon Stone, who play their parts with a wicked wit and devilish fun. Douglas embodies the obsession in his character like a pro, using emotion and body language to confirm Curran's descent into infatuation. Stone steals the show, not only with her provocative figure shots, but with the excellent wit she employs in her dialogue. Exchanges between the two characters are impressive, if not eerie.The murder mystery is intriguing, for the most part. It keeps us waiting until the ending, to let us know the final answer that will solve everything we've been suspecting. Each clue left to us by the story has two different paths, one that points to another possible suspect as the killer, and one that points to the until-now prime suspect Tramell. The final shot answers this question, but lessens the effect of the picture as a whole because we come to realize just how much the movie toys with us, leading us to believe one thing, and then betraying the trust we have put into Tramell.The movie serves little other purpose other than to show off director Verhoeven's virtuoso style as he invites us on a very lurid trip into obsession. He fills the canvas with over-the-top sex scenes, which do little to enhance the effect of the film. There are scenes that work nicely, such as the interrogation scene, in which Tramell coolly shifts in her chair giving the detectives a clean view of her mid-section; the shock on their faces is priceless. But the movie also contains its fair share of gratuitous sex, which comes close to crossing the boundaries of soft and hard-core erotica. This is more of a turn-off, and may even provoke snickers rather than a serious approach.In summation, &quot;Basic Instinct&quot; has all the good parts of a thriller, but the bad parts outweigh them heavily. The acting is stellar, while the central plot is full of mystery. Too bad that Verhoeven trades in a good deal for cheap pornography and an ending that revokes everything we've been lead to believe from the beginning.",3,"Stellar performances, but lacks intensity.",1000684800,"09 17, 2001",2001,4058,"[""'ll"", 'get', 'formalities', 'cut', 'right', 'chase', 'quot', 'Basic', 'Instinct', 'quot', 'great', 'acting', 'wonderful', 'cast', 'conceivably', 'good', 'story', 'hands', 'director', 'Paul', 'Verhoeven', 'who', 'well-known', 'use', 'style', 'substance', 'mystery', 'psychological', 'inklings', 'fall', 'increasingly', 'short', 'suspenseful', 'leading', 'twist', 'twist', 'work', 'others', 'founder', 'sense', 'direction', 'right', 'place', 'way', 'where', 'go', 'surprisingly', 'joyless', 'intensity.The', 'film', 'begins', 'fittingly', 'enough', 'sex', 'scene', 'former', 'rock', 'star', 'who', 'now', 'prestigious', 'community', 'member', 'San', 'Francisco', 'murdered', 'ice', 'pick', 'intercourse', 'unseen', 'blonde', 'woman', 'detective', 'Nick', 'Curran', 'Michael', 'Douglas', 'attention', 'sultry', 'author', 'Catherine', 'Tramell', 'Sharon', 'Stone', 'who', 'was', 'last', 'seen', 'murder', 'victim', 'also', ""n't"", 'help', 'murder', 'exact', 'reenactment', 'similar', 'event', 'one', 'novels.At', 'first', 'Curran', 'turned', 'off', 'Tramell', 'forthrightness', 'testimony', 'relationship', 'victim', 'certain', 'lie', 'detector', 'test', 'innocent', 'wrong', 'dig', 'nails', 'clues', 'also', 'mesmerized', 'danger', 'playing', 'head', 'games', 'life', 'take', 'nose', 'dive', 'smoking', 'drinking', 'again', 'so', 'infatuated', 'Tramell', 'even', 'more', 'determined', 'prove', 'innocent.So', 'really', 'work', 'elements', 'do', 'such', 'wonderful', 'acting', 'sometimes', 'witty', 'dialogue', 'exchanges', 'others', 'such', 'ambiguous', 'clues', 'lurid', 'sex', 'scenes', 'do', 'not', 'movie', 'see', 'terrific', 'talents', 'cast', 'take', 'equation', 'what', 'have', 'skin', 'flick', 'spiced', 'up', 'Hollywood', 'makeover.The', 'movie', 'two', 'main', 'stars', 'are', 'central', 'attractions', 'featuring', 'very', 'effective', 'work', 'Michael', 'Douglas', 'Sharon', 'Stone', 'who', 'play', 'parts', 'wicked', 'wit', 'devilish', 'fun', 'Douglas', 'obsession', 'character', 'pro', 'using', 'emotion', 'body', 'language', 'confirm', 'Curran', 'descent', 'infatuation', 'Stone', 'show', 'not', 'only', 'provocative', 'figure', 'shots', 'excellent', 'wit', 'dialogue', 'Exchanges', 'two', 'characters', 'are', 'impressive', 'not', 'eerie.The', 'murder', 'mystery', 'intriguing', 'most', 'part', 'waiting', 'ending', 'let', 'know', 'final', 'answer', 'will', 'solve', 'everything', ""'ve"", 'been', 'suspecting', 'clue', 'left', 'story', 'two', 'different', 'paths', 'one', 'possible', 'suspect', 'killer', 'one', 'until-now', 'prime', 'suspect', 'Tramell', 'final', 'shot', 'answers', 'question', 'effect', 'picture', 'whole', 'come', 'realize', 'just', 'how', 'much', 'movie', 'leading', 'believe', 'one', 'thing', 'then', 'betraying', 'trust', 'have', 'put', 'Tramell.The', 'movie', 'serves', 'little', 'other', 'purpose', 'other', 'show', 'off', 'director', 'Verhoeven', 'virtuoso', 'style', 'very', 'lurid', 'trip', 'obsession', 'canvas', 'over-the-top', 'sex', 'scenes', 'do', 'little', 'enhance', 'effect', 'film', 'are', 'scenes', 'work', 'nicely', 'such', 'interrogation', 'scene', 'Tramell', 'coolly', 'chair', 'giving', 'detectives', 'clean', 'view', 'mid-section', 'shock', 'priceless', 'movie', 'also', 'fair', 'share', 'gratuitous', 'sex', 'close', 'crossing', 'boundaries', 'soft', 'hard-core', 'erotica', 'more', 'turn-off', 'may', 'even', 'provoke', 'snickers', 'rather', 'serious', 'approach.In', 'summation', 'quot', 'Basic', 'Instinct', 'quot', 'good', 'parts', 'thriller', 'bad', 'parts', 'outweigh', 'heavily', 'acting', 'stellar', 'central', 'plot', 'full', 'mystery', 'Too', 'bad', 'Verhoeven', 'trades', 'good', 'deal', 'cheap', 'pornography', 'ending', 'revokes', 'everything', ""'ve"", 'been', 'lead', 'believe', 'beginning']",N/A

73264,A7RM685PHBK20,078401020X,Eric,"[4, 8]","Most erotic thrillers are quite bad.  Oh, there are a few exceptions such as Brian De Palma's Body Double and Dressed to Kill but most of them have a straight-to-video quality.  As for Basic Instinct, it creates a question  that makes one ponder:  does a bad ending ruin an otherwise solid  movie?Basic Instinct begins with a woman making love to a man tied to a  bedpost.  We can't see her face since it's covered by her blonde hair.  In  a moment of ecstasy, as the man reaches his climax, she pulls out an  icepick from underneath the bed and stabs him several times.  It's a  violent and rather shocking beginning.  Enter detective Nick Curran  (Michael Douglas), who seems hell bent on solving this case.  It seems the  murdered man was a wealthy former rock star and his girlfriend is the  primary suspect.  Her name is Catherine Tramell (Sharon Stone), a novelist  who is also quite the seductress.There's one element to the case that  could either prove her innocence or her guilt and that is the fact that she  wrote a scene in her book identical with the murder that occurred.  Dr.  Beth Garner (Jeanne Tripplehorn) believes that Tramell is just using the  book as an alibi and that she really is the killer.  Curran, who at first  suspects her, begins to change his feelings when he starts falling for her.  The danger heightens as he becomes sexually involved with Tramell.Basic  Instinct is fairly entertaining through all of its 129 minute running time.  It's suspense wavers a bit but it works when it's there.  The sex scenes  are also quite steamy.  The performances are also all-around solid.  Michael Douglas is convincing as the cop with an edge. Jeanne Tripplehorn  also delivers a good performance.  The real scene stealer, though, is  definitely Sharon Stone.  Her portrayal of a seductress is quite good but  she also shows moments of such innocence and emotion that it makes the  audience wonder if she is the killer or not.  Her performance was truly  Oscar-caliber.Now, onto what doesn't work.  There are some logic  loopholes and I seriously doubt the police are that dumb though those  aspects are fairly easy to overlook.  What really displeased me was the  film's ending.  Sure, the last several minutes are suspenseful but no real  plot twist occurs.  There are a bunch of red herrings thrown around to  confuse the audience and it really adds up to nothing.  The ending is  really just a form of manipulation and it's all enforced primarily by the  film's final scene, which left me feeling a bit cheated.

73265,A1N7YA81ZI4KAF,078401020X,"E. Valero ""Eterno""","[2, 2]","Michael Douglas plays Nick Curran, a troubled detective who is investigating the ice-pick murder of rock star. The prime suspect is the victim's lover, the overtly-sexual Catherine Tramell, a beautiful, blonde mystery novelist who shows no remorse and is in the habit of not wearing any under-clothing. Curran falls under his suspects seductive spell and what follows is a hi-speed cat and mouse game which leaves several dead and one incredibly confused cop.Although Sharon Stone was making movies a full decade before this film was made (""Deadly Blessings"", ""King Solomon's Mines""), it was this raunchy, erotic thriller that finally put the blonde on the map. ""Basic Instinct"" became a massive hit when it was first released in 1992. The media had a field day covering the scandal this film caused. Religious groups were bothered by the sexually explicit images depicted in the film and the Gay community was infuriated of the negative portrayal of homosexuals. The public in general didn't seem to mind since ""Basic Instinct"" ended up grossing over $100 million domestically. I guess we were all entranced by Sharon Stone's slick, icy beauty and the infamous leg crossing scene.Whatever one thinks of the film, few will deny that Sharon Stone is one of the film's highlights. She steals every single scene she's in and her performance is captivating and it's not just because of her incredible look. It's how she delivers her lines, her body language, her voice, her cool demeanor. She mastered the art of seduction and we clearly see why Nick fell prey to her dark charms. These elements along with the witty dialogue all contribute in to making Catherine Tramell one of the greatest screen villians ever.One of the problems I had with the film was with the casting of Michael Douglas. He is a great actor but in my opinion, he seemed a bit too old for the part. In many scenes he reminded me of someone's grandfather smitten by his daughter's girlfriend. Since the release of the sequel recently, there have been several individuals/critics who have complained about Sharon Stone being too old to be reprising the role and acting alongside a younger leading man. These same individuals don't seem to care when film-makers cast much older men in the lead opposite younger women (in some instances much younger women). No one complained when Harrison Ford was cast alongside Michelle Pfieffer or when Sean Connery was cast alongside the beautiful Catherine Zeta-Jones but when an attractive actress who is in her late 40's, in this case Stone takes the lead in an erotic thriller, everyone has something negative to say. It appears there is a double standard here.As for the film's sexual content. Anyone who has ever seen Paul Verhoeven's earlier films ""De Vierde man"" (""The Fourth Man"") or ""Spetters"" will know he does not shy away from showcasing human sexuality graphically and several of these European films will even make ""Basic Instinct"" look tame. This film was clearly made for adults and it was always advertised as sexually explicit so keep in mind this film is not for everyone. ""Basic Instinct"" is unquestionably sleazy but it is clever and Sharon Stone's polished portrayal of a hard-as-nails temptress with a heart of stone (no pun intended) is reason enough to recommend it. Despite all the negative, nothing can hide the fact that this is an entertaining, sexually charged thriller that is well-made and well-acted. It's amoral message may be evil but it's brilliant.Highly recommended.",4,"""She's Evil.

Let me say this, do not underestimate this movie!Although it may not be as shocking or cutting-edge as it was back in the day; this movie still provides a lot of substance from the original intention.  The acting is superb.  There is honest chemistry between Douglas and Stone; each play off of each other's strengths making it come off as genuine and not forced at all.  The supporting characters also add essential realism and help develop the story even further.  Within the characters, each has their own distinct personality and the viewer gets to know them pretty well by the end of the story.  The characters are dramactic when called for, but also provide subtle comic relief when needed as well.The directing however, is what makes this movie so well good.  Everything from the script (kept relatively in its original form) all the way to the lighting and the way that affects how the viewer reacts to certain scenes.  As for the nude/sex scenes; I believe they were done in a way that enhances the story and/or develops the characters further; not done just for the sake of doing them.As I mentioned don't let this movie fool you.

The music enriches the crime thriller, something akin to Psycho perhaps, certainly in the car journey sequences along that Californian coastal road. The film's sexual tension builds slowly. When it erupts, it contributes to the story rather than being a digression. Apart from murder, this movie is about obsession as well as love. An underlying theme is about friendship and teamwork in the police department. People who work in organisations witness cliques and cabals; it's part of an organization's life. Here, the core team members support each other despite some hefty disagreements and external threats. Sharon Stone is at her sultry best, not only with her body and persona but also, her voice. Michael Douglas is convincing as the unstable policeman. As in so many films, love might be the conclusion? If not seen already, watch the film and answer that question.

73279,A319SKSB556033,078401020X,"Inspector Gadget ""Go Go Gadget Reviews""","[6, 7]","At the time, Basic Instinct was considered shocking and new. In retrospect, in a world where much harder pornography is so commonplace, it's not got much sex appeal going for it. What I do like is the OTT game of cat and mouse between Stone and Douglas.Catherine Tramell is a writer of sleazy novels who lives out her pulp trash after she's written it. This would be fine if she wrote about saving the children or building churches but Tramell writes about sex, murder and betrayal. She's accused of murdering her Rock-star boyfriend by icepicking his head 86-times during a massive shagathon. She feels no guilt and no sadness and Detective Nick Curran regards her with utmost suspicion even though she passed a lie-detector test.Determined to find the truth among Catherine Tramell's web of pork-pies, Curran falls into her world of sin and seduction. Already a bad cop well on the way to cleaning up his act, all of his nasty habits come flooding back to him. The drinking, the snorting, the smoking...all because of a blonde. I would be impervious to this.In fact, Jeanne Triplehorn, who plays Curran's psychiatrist, is a billion times more sexy than Sharon Stone. Especially when she wears her glasses. But that's just my thing.One can accuse Basic Instinct of being contrived, overly-complicated and over-plotted but they'd be missing the point. I do feel that the irony of gutter-level fiction becoming real within gutter-level fiction would have been more appropriate and perhaps louder if Basic Instinct were a book, but as a movie it makes its point despite the high level tawdriness that most audiences are going think is all the film has to offer.Paul Verhoeven takes a Hitchcockian approach to the material as there are already a few connections to Vertigo. At one point in the film, Sharon Stone even dresses up in an outfit identical to Kim Novak (hairstyle and all). You can't help but notice the sleaze sometimes though. Like Michael Douglas walking around a nightclub in a horrible V-neck sweater or the 'infamous' leg-crossing scene with is only really notable for its unsubtlety.There are also some parts of the film which kind of date it badly. The production design and fashion is sooo early 90s. It's not the kind of story that oozes class but the outdated look kinda distracts. But the one amazing thing Basic Instinct has going for it is Jerry Goldsmith's wonderfully haunting score. Truly one of his best in the latter part of his career.Add it all up and Basic Instinct is wildly inconsistent in terms of quality but the sheer OTT nature of plot is enough to keep it afloat. And all these years later, when we have mostly become impervious to titillation, people still remember all the skanky publicity and the aroma of sleaze will never quite die away. See past all that and you'll find a clever thriller underneath.",4,"Well remembered, but not a classic",1146268800,"04 29, 2006",2006,2844,"['time', 'Basic', 'Instinct', 'was', 'considered', 'shocking', 'new', 'retrospect', 'world', 'where', 'much', 'harder', 'pornography', 'so', 'commonplace', 'not', 'got', 'much', 'sex', 'appeal', 'going', 'What', 'do', 'OTT', 'game', 'cat', 'mouse', 'Stone', 'Douglas.Catherine', 'Tramell', 'writer', 'sleazy', 'novels', 'who', 'out', 'pulp', 'trash', 'written', 'would', 'be', 'fine', 'wrote', 'saving', 'children', 'building', 'churches', 'Tramell', 'sex', 'murder', 'betrayal', 'accused', 'murdering', 'Rock-star', 'boyfriend', 'icepicking', 'head', '86-times', 'massive', 'shagathon', 'guilt', 'sadness', 'Detective', 'Nick', 'Curran', 'utmost', 'suspicion', 'even', 'passed', 'lie-detector', 'test.Determined', 'find', 'truth', 'Catherine', 'Tramell', 'web', 'pork-pies', 'Curran', 'world', 'sin', 'seduction', 'Already', 'bad', 'cop', 'well', 'way', 'cleaning', 'up', 'act', 'nasty', 'habits', 'come', 'flooding', 'back', 'drinking', 'snorting', 'smoking', 'blonde', 'would', 'be', 'impervious', 'this.In', 'fact', 'Jeanne', 'Triplehorn', 'who', 'Curran', 'psychiatrist', 'billion', 'times', 'more', 'sexy', 'Sharon', 'Stone', 'Especially', 'when', 'glasses', 'just', 'thing.One', 'can', 'accuse', 'Basic', 'Instinct', 'being', 'contrived', 'overly-complicated', 'over-plotted', ""'d"", 'be', 'missing', 'point', 'do', 'feel', 'irony', 'gutter-level', 'fiction', 'becoming', 'real', 'gutter-level', 'fiction', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'more', 'appropriate', 'perhaps', 'louder', 'Basic', 'Instinct', 'were', 'book', 'movie', 'point', 'high', 'level', 'tawdriness', 'most', 'audiences', 'are', 'going', 'think', 'film', 'offer.Paul', 'Verhoeven', 'Hitchcockian', 'approach', 'material', 'are', 'already', 'few', 'connections', 'Vertigo', 'one', 'point', 'film', 'Sharon', 'Stone', 'even', 'up', 'outfit', 'identical', 'Kim', 'Novak', 'hairstyle', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'notice', 'sleaze', 'sometimes', 'Michael', 'Douglas', 'walking', 'around', 'nightclub', 'horrible', 'V-neck', 'sweater', ""'infamous"", 'leg-crossing', 'scene', 'only', 'really', 'notable', 'are', 'also', 'parts', 'film', 'kind', 'date', 'badly', 'production', 'design', 'fashion', 'sooo', 'early', '90s', 'not', 'kind', 'story', 'class', 'outdated', 'look', 'kinda', 'distracts', 'one', 'amazing', 'thing', 'Basic', 'Instinct', 'going', 'Jerry', 'Goldsmith', 'wonderfully', 'haunting', 'score', 'Truly', 'one', 'best', 'latter', 'part', 'career.Add', 'up', 'Basic', 'Instinct', 'wildly', 'inconsistent', 'terms', 'quality', 'sheer', 'OTT', 'nature', 'plot', 'enough', 'keep', 'afloat', 'years', 'later', 'when', 'have', 'mostly', 'become', 'impervious', 'titillation', 'people', 'still', 'remember', 'skanky', 'publicity', 'aroma', 'sleaze', 'will', 'never', 'quite', 'die', 'away', 'See', ""'ll"", 'find', 'clever', 'thriller', 'underneath']",N/A

It was the first non-sci-fi Verhoeven movie that I've seen, ranking above Hollowman and below Total Recall in my Verhoeven list.  We even get a famous Verhoeven gunshot squib shot!  It's just one gunshot, but hey it splatters and is remenicent of RoboCop and Total Recall.  Anyway, Michael Douglas and Sharon Stone are both excellent players and are very fun to watch play out their scenes, and not just the nudy ones.  This may have alot of sex in it, but if you know Verhoeven you already knew that.  Every one of his movies that I've seen directed by him show boobs, but that's not the point of this movie even though it may seem like that at times.  This movie kept me guessing up until literally the very ending credits.  The suspense is very good and helps move this movie along at a good pace.

73301,A25RN8X70DSZLU,078401020X,JRP,"[0, 3]","I'm back with another movie review these reviews have to do with movies made in either 2002 or 1992. This is 20 Years Ago Basic Instinict. Now I saw this a couple of days ago I remember watching it 10 or 11 years ago & not liking it. Seeing it again I can say this is a good movie. Basic Instinict was directed by Paul Verohen he directed Total Recall, Robocop, & Starship Troopers. It stars Michael Douglas as Detective Nick Curran, Sharon Stone as Catherine Tramell, George Dzunaza as Gus Moran, Jeanne Tripllehorn as Dr Beth Garner Daniel von Bargen as Lieutenant Marty Nielsen, Lilani Sarelle as Roxy & Dorthy Malone as Hazel Dobkins. Story is the cops are investigating a murder scene of an ex rock star 2 Cops Detective Nick Curran & Gus Moran are trying to figure out who did it. The only suspect they have is Catherine Tramell. During a meeting at the department they find out that Catherine Tramell has written several novels in 1 of the books a guy is killed the same way that Johnny Boz is which raises a red flag. So Detective Curran & Gus take her to The PD to question her. Of course this is where we get the famous interrigation scene with the leg crossing & all that great stuff. You learn that Detective Curran has issues a few years prior he killed some tourists accidently he was high to boot. You knw Michael Douglas knows how to bring emotion & anger to his roles it reminds me of when I get mad. He has to up with this Pschologist Dr Beth Garner I guess they had some sort of realationship. He goes to a bar which he said he quit drinking & he has to put up with some BS from Lieutenant Marty Nielson he snaps on him in the same way I would. Then you have a wtf scene when he's having s  3  x with Dr Garner it was just unusal for me & could've been left out it did nothing. Then The Cops find out about Catherine's troubled past about the death of her parents, a college roomate & she had a boyfriend that was a boxer who died in the ring. Detective Curran follows her to figure out what she is about. He finds out that she likes to befriend killers 1 in particular Hazel Dobkins who killed her family. He runs into Catherine she starts saying things about him that should be secert. The only 1 who should have those files is Dr Garner is the only 1 that has access to thsoe files he confronts her over it she tells him that Lieutenatn Nielsen asked for them cause he was going to discharge him if  couldn't evaluate Curran. So Curran goes straight for Nielson's office & grabs him by the shirt collor he thinks that Nileson sold Catherine Tramell his file. Curran is suspended. The next morning he gets a call that Lieutenant Nielson has been killed. So Curran becomes a suspect cause of what happend the day before. He is interrigated & he says some of the same things that Catherine said during her interrigation & he started smoking again in fact earlier Catherine said he will start doing all of that again. She's writing a book about a Cop that falls for the wrong Woman & he's klled by her.He starts an affair with Catherine but he knows that she killed Johnny Boz. Roxy doesn't like it cause she & Catherine are lovers. Later on he meets up with Gus who is drunk & it's a funny scene. Anyway you have Roxy try to run  Detective Curran over. Resulting in a car chase she crash's in an area where road construction is going on her car goes off the road falls several feet where she dies. Then they find out when Roxy was 16 she had killed her brothers. He checks on Catherine where they start talking & she tells him about a girl who was obsessed with her in College named Lisa Holberman. Curran looks into & he finds out that Lisa Holberman is Beth Garner.He confornts her she tells him that it was Catherine that was obssed with her. You also have a 1 second cameo by Bradford English.Curran goes through some files & finds out that Beth's husband was killed the same way that LT Nielson was. Currna vists Catherine where he finds out her book is complete she ends the realtionship. Gus finds out about an old roomate of Catherine's they have arranged to meet at a hotel. Curran see's somebody on the 4th floor & it plays out just like in Catherine's book Gus is killed. Beth is there & he suspects her she has her hand in her pocket he shoots her before she dies she tells Curran that she loves him. He checks the pocket only to find her keys. The Cops find a blonde wig & a departmet jacket they found several of Catherine Tamell's novel's in her apartment all signs point to Dr Garner. Then you get the ending & it's like whatever. Still I think for what it did it was pretty good. I think Joe Esztherhas is a capable writer at times I don't think he's awful. You want to see badly written dialouge see what Eric Heisserer or Rob Zombie writes. Payl Verhoven did a decent job here. If I want Verohven at his best though I'll see Robocop, Total Recall or Starship Troopers. Michael Douglas did a good job. Sharon Stone did her job well.It was to be evil, seductive & hot. It's not like she was awful like Lindsey Lohan. They went with a relitive unkown cause Douglas wanted Kim Basinger Verovhen wanted Demi Moore Meg Ryan's name was thrown around too.  George Dzunaza was ok. Daniel von Borgen was there he didn't have much to do but he was decent.It's sad what happend to him though.  Leilani Sarell was ok. Dorthy Malone was ok.I know that there is a Basic Instinct 2 no I haven't seen it I have heard really bad thing about it if anybody wants me to review it leave a commit cause I can get it cheap at a Dollar Store.

73302,A3INMIZIYJ9BQ4,078401020X,"Judi Fryer ""Judi,  Entertainment-glutton""","[6, 6]","I think this movie works, even after the passage of time, because the plot provides a true mystery, it was filmed beautifully, has a timeless, lush score, and basically exposes us to the most basic of instincts in a completely candid and passionate manner, and is therefore a treat for all the senses.Remembered best for the interrogation scene, re-watching the films recalls the intricacies of the who-dunit factor and rekindles the heat generated by the sexual and mental interplay between the cool calculating character created by Stone and the  bright, but confused character who is constantly exuding simmering raw sexuality, brilliantly portrayed by Douglas.The frankness and specific details of the many 'sex-scenes' makes one wonder even more than ever why so much has been made of the touching and beautifully filmed sexual scene in the recently released film 'Monster's Ball'.The Unrated Collector's Edition DVD of 'Basic Instinct' contains many interesting features; the best of which was a relaxed but informative commentary by Director Paul Verhoeven and PD Jan De Bont.  Not only do they provide a very interesting and fact-filled commentary about the making of the film, the background info on why and how certain scenes were shot, details about location data, and references contained in the film related to the master, Alfred Hitchcock; but they also give us inside information about the cast; their personal reactions to their roles, the intimate details of the shooting of the complex sex depictions, technical details about filming the bloody and violent murders, as well as other small but oh-so-revealing tidbits that make us movie-goers feel like real insiders.Conversely, the commentary by feminist critic Camille Paglia was a stern, passionless-reading of a seemingly written-text by an individual with a very obvious agenda.  It is always interesting to be exposed to differing opinions, but in this particular case Ms. Paglia has an affinity for telling viewers in fairly biased language 'what' they are seeing.  While a director can tell us 'why' a scene was shot a certain way, lit in a particular manner, contained specific language, etc., the viewer is left to draw their personal opinions as to the intent of the final product.  Whereas, Ms. Paglia consistently describes for the viewer what a particular scene is portraying based on her personal prospective only, as she has no part in the actually 'making' of the film.  This commentary may or may not be interesting based on the viewer's point of view and/or their patience and/or tolerance to hear a different viewpoint.  The good thing about this, as with all 'special features', is that it is there if you are interested, but it isn't mandatory if you are not.The 'ice-pick' pen is a 'cute' selling promo.  The package, as mentioned by some other reviewers has a problem.  If you inspect the hinges carefully, you will note thare is simply no clearance for 'opening' the hinge; best to remove the cover as if changing the jewel case on a CD.All in all this was well worth the price to retrospectively view a visually beautiful, mentally stimulating, candidly sexual film, and additionally to gain insight into its creation.  If you saw it originally, step back in time to be reminded of what you may have forgotten over the years.  If you have never watched 'Basic Instict' find out what all the up-roar was about when the film was originally shot and released.",4,This is a decade-old movie that has held up very well.,1029628800,"08 18, 2002",2002,3449,"['think', 'movie', 'even', 'passage', 'time', 'plot', 'true', 'mystery', 'was', 'filmed', 'beautifully', 'timeless', 'lush', 'score', 'basically', 'most', 'basic', 'instincts', 'completely', 'candid', 'passionate', 'manner', 'therefore', 'treat', 'senses.Remembered', 'best', 'interrogation', 'scene', 're-watching', 'films', 'intricacies', 'who-dunit', 'factor', 'heat', 'generated', 'sexual', 'mental', 'interplay', 'cool', 'calculating', 'character', 'created', 'Stone', 'bright', 'confused', 'character', 'who', 'constantly', 'exuding', 'simmering', 'raw', 'sexuality', 'brilliantly', 'portrayed', 'Douglas.The', 'frankness', 'specific', 'details', 'many', ""'sex-scenes"", 'one', 'wonder', 'even', 'more', 'ever', 'why', 'so', 'much', 'been', 'made', 'touching', 'beautifully', 'filmed', 'sexual', 'scene', 'recently', 'released', 'film', ""'Monster"", ""Ball'.The"", 'Unrated', 'Collector', 'Edition', 'DVD', ""'Basic"", 'Instinct', 'contains', 'many', 'interesting', 'features', 'best', 'was', 'relaxed', 'informative', 'commentary', 'Director', 'Paul', 'Verhoeven', 'PD', 'Jan', 'De', 'Bont', 'Not', 'only', 'do', 'provide', 'very', 'interesting', 'fact-filled', 'commentary', 'making', 'film', 'background', 'info', 'why', 'how', 'certain', 'scenes', 'were', 'shot', 'details', 'location', 'data', 'references', 'contained', 'film', 'related', 'master', 'Alfred', 'Hitchcock', 'also', 'give', 'information', 'cast', 'personal', 'reactions', 'roles', 'intimate', 'details', 'shooting', 'complex', 'sex', 'depictions', 'technical', 'details', 'filming', 'bloody', 'violent', 'murders', 'as', 'well', 'other', 'small', 'oh-so-revealing', 'tidbits', 'make', 'movie-goers', 'feel', 'real', 'insiders.Conversely', 'commentary', 'feminist', 'critic', 'Camille', 'Paglia', 'was', 'stern', 'passionless-reading', 'seemingly', 'written-text', 'individual', 'very', 'obvious', 'agenda', 'always', 'interesting', 'be', 'exposed', 'differing', 'opinions', 'particular', 'case', 'Ms.', 'Paglia', 'affinity', 'telling', 'viewers', 'fairly', 'biased', 'language', ""'what"", 'are', 'seeing', 'director', 'can', 'tell', 'scene', 'was', 'shot', 'certain', 'way', 'lit', 'particular', 'manner', 'contained', 'specific', 'language', 'etc.', 'viewer', 'left', 'draw', 'personal', 'opinions', 'intent', 'final', 'product', 'Whereas', 'Ms.', 'Paglia', 'consistently', 'viewer', 'what', 'particular', 'scene', 'portraying', 'based', 'personal', 'prospective', 'only', 'part', 'actually', ""'making"", 'film', 'commentary', 'may', 'may', 'not', 'be', 'interesting', 'based', 'viewer', 'point', 'view', 'and/or', 'patience', 'and/or', 'tolerance', 'hear', 'different', 'viewpoint', 'good', 'thing', ""'special"", 'features', 'there', 'are', 'interested', ""n't"", 'mandatory', 'are', 'not.The', ""'ice-pick"", 'pen', ""'cute"", 'selling', 'promo', 'package', 'mentioned', 'other', 'reviewers', 'problem', 'inspect', 'hinges', 'carefully', 'will', 'note', 'thare', 'simply', 'clearance', ""'opening"", 'hinge', 'best', 'remove', 'cover', 'changing', 'jewel', 'case', 'CD.All', 'was', 'well', 'price', 'retrospectively', 'view', 'visually', 'beautiful', 'mentally', 'stimulating', 'candidly', 'sexual', 'film', 'additionally', 'gain', 'insight', 'creation', 'saw', 'originally', 'step', 'back', 'time', 'be', 'reminded', 'what', 'may', 'have', 'forgotten', 'years', 'have', 'never', 'watched', ""'Basic"", 'Instict', 'find', 'what', 'up-roar', 'was', 'when', 'film', 'was', 'originally', 'shot', 'released']",N/A
73303,AIFXFHO2N9WJB,078401020X,"Justice0309 ""Justice""","[4, 4]","By now most people are aware of some of the more notorious scenes in this popular 1992 movie about a murder/mystery writer (Sharon Stone) being prime suspect for a string of murders that eerily resemble the death scenes in her novels.  What some people may not know is that this movie actually has a really intriguing story.  I decided to rent this movie one night when not much else was at the rental store and I was in the mood for a mystery movie and the clerk at the rental store recommended the new unrated edition of ""Basic Instinct"".  At first I was skeptical, I figured it wasn't much for story, just eye-candy, and I wanted a story.  The clerk assured me that it was more than just eye-candy, this movie had an excellent story full of twists that would keep you guessing until the end, so I decided, why not give it a try.  To my surprise the movie was excellent.  Even the most notorious scene in the movie (the interrogation scene) which when talked about sounds like it was a marketing ploy to get plenty of guys in the seats, actually served a purpose in the film by showing the power Sharon's character weilded over men with her sexuality.The acting in this movie is quite superb, especially by Sharon Stone who you never quite know if she's good or evil or simply playing the devil's advocate.  Michael Douglas also does an excellent job of playing a loose-cannon detective who is the lead investigator in the case and gets involved with Sharon's character.  The directing by Paul Verhoeven is also top-notch, possilby his best.So, with all that being said, don't write this movie off as simply another raunchy movie with no story, give it a chance and I'm sure you'll be surprised.""Basic Instinct - The Unrated Director's Cut"" contains language, violence, strong sexuality/nudity, and drug references.",4,Surprising and provocative.,1100131200,"11 11, 2004",2004,1817,"['now', 'most', 'people', 'are', 'aware', 'more', 'notorious', 'scenes', 'popular', '1992', 'movie', 'murder/mystery', 'writer', 'Sharon', 'Stone', 'being', 'prime', 'suspect', 'string', 'murders', 'eerily', 'resemble', 'death', 'scenes', 'novels', 'What', 'people', 'may', 'not', 'know', 'movie', 'actually', 'really', 'intriguing', 'story', 'decided', 'rent', 'movie', 'one', 'night', 'when', 'not', 'much', 'else', 'was', 'rental', 'store', 'was', 'mood', 'mystery', 'movie', 'clerk', 'rental', 'store', 'recommended', 'new', 'unrated', 'edition', 'Basic', 'Instinct', 'first', 'was', 'skeptical', 'figured', 'was', ""n't"", 'much', 'story', 'just', 'eye-candy', 'wanted', 'story', 'clerk', 'assured', 'was', 'more', 'just', 'eye-candy', 'movie', 'had', 'excellent', 'story', 'full', 'twists', 'would', 'keep', 'guessing', 'end', 'decided', 'why', 'not', 'give', 'try', 'surprise', 'movie', 'was', 'excellent', 'Even', 'most', 'notorious', 'scene', 'movie', 'interrogation', 'scene', 'when', 'talked', 'sounds', 'was', 'marketing', 'ploy', 'get', 'plenty', 'guys', 'seats', 'actually', 'served', 'purpose', 'film', 'showing', 'power', 'Sharon', 'character', 'weilded', 'men', 'sexuality.The', 'acting', 'movie', 'quite', 'superb', 'especially', 'Sharon', 'Stone', 'who', 'never', 'quite', 'know', 'good', 'evil', 'simply', 'playing', 'devil', 'advocate', 'Michael', 'Douglas', 'also', 'excellent', 'job', 'playing', 'loose-cannon', 'detective', 'who', 'lead', 'investigator', 'case', 'involved', 'Sharon', 'character', 'directing', 'Paul', 'Verhoeven', 'also', 'top-notch', 'possilby', 'best.So', 'being', 'said', 'do', ""n't"", 'write', 'movie', 'off', 'simply', 'raunchy', 'movie', 'story', 'give', 'chance', ""'m"", 'sure', ""'ll"", 'be', 'surprised', 'Basic', 'Instinct', 'Unrated', 'Director', 'Cut', 'language', 'violence', 'strong', 'sexuality/nudity', 'drug', 'references']",N/A

73305,A2YQ5O6XV23543,078401020X,Kevin H. Dudley,"[7, 7]","Plot Details: This opinion reveals major details about the movie's plot.After watching the new DVD of the uncut & uncensored version of the 1992 erotic-thriller Basic Instinct, I was surprised at how well the movie has aged. I also noticed that it doesn't seem quite as shocking as far as the sex scenes & subject matter are concerned as it originally did when it was in theaters.When this film was originally released in the U.S. back in 1992 (in edited R-rated form), it ignited a firestorm of controversy in which gay alliances blasted the film saying that it painted homosexuals as nothing but murderous psychopaths. Women's groups also said that the movie was extremely misogynistic as well. I never could really see what everyone was complaining about, since the women in the movie are actually the ones with all of the control and power. As it for portraying homosexuals in a negative light, I also disagree. But that's old news.Now that the initial debate about the movie has pretty much died, Basic Instinct can now be seen as what it was strictly meant to be, which is one of the best erotic thrillers to be released by a major hollywood studio. It has its problems at times, but for what it tried to do, it succeeds extremely well.The now well-known plot (that I won't give too much away from in case someone hasn't seen it yet) involves Nick Curran (Michael Douglas) and Guss (George Dzundza) who are detectives in San Francisco investigating the brutal murder of a former rock star and nightclub owner Johnny Boz (Bill Cable). Johnny was brutally stabbed repeatedly with an icepick during sex at the moment of climax while he was tied up. The prime suspect is the beautiful, intelligent and mysterious Catherine Tramell (Sharon Stone), an author of erotic murder mysteries who was also Johnny's girlfriend. It seems that her most recent book has a part in which a vicious murder happens that is strikingly similar to Johnny Boz's murder. Nick has had a troubled history as a cop that has included cocaine and alcohol abuse, and accidentally shooting an couple of innocent tourists during a botched stakeout (for which he was cleared of all charges). He has regular meetings with the local police psychiatrist Elisabeth Garner (Jeanne Tipplehorn) with whom he had an intense relationship with at one point. He's also being kept under the watchful eye of Internal Affairs due to his checkered past. During the investigation, Nick finds himself becoming extremely attracted to Catherine, much to everyone's dismay. Catherine is also bisexual and lives with a beautiful lesbian named Roxy (Leilani Sarelle). The movie ends up piling red herrings on top of red herrings, and some characters end up not being quite who they seemed to be at first. The plot barrels along to an abrupt conclusion that will likely make people scratch their heads and utter a collective ""huh?!"".This was Dutch director Paul Verhoeven's third American film after his breakout success with 1987's cult-classic Robocop and the equally ultraviolent 1990 sci-fi Schwarzenegger vehicle Total Recall. He has stated in many interviews that one of his favorite filmmakers of all time is Alfred Hitchcock. He viewed Basic Instinct as his chance to make a Hitchcockian type film but with some explicit sexual content that caused audiences (especially those in the U.S.) to sit up and take notice.The infamous sex scenes in the movie caused a great stir since they combine both sex and violence in sometimes jarring doses. A perfect example is when Nick and Elisabeth begin to passionately make out in her apartment. What starts out as very erotic turns savage when Nick borderline rapes her while entering her from behind. Another would be the opening shot showing an unknown woman having sex with Johnny on his bed. She is on top of him and eventually ties up his hands while he sucks and kisses one of her nipples. After tying them, she starts to bring them both to orgasm before stabbing him repeatedly in the face and neck with an ice pick.That scene is what really makes the central sex scene between Catherine and Nick so memorable since she also ties up his hands (after some truly carnal activity) and proceeds to mimic the opening scene. The audience I originally saw this movie with in theaters were literally gasping with breath since what started out as erotic quickly turned very tense. It's also nice to see that this movie showed that sexualy explicit material can also be integral to a movie's plot since we're waiting to see if she is going to kill Nick like how Johnny was killed at the beginning. The audience ends up not concentrating as much on the explicit sexual activity as they are what Catherine's planning to do to Nick.The film features some truly gorgeous and moody cinematography by Jan de Bont (who would become a director in his own right with Twister and Speed). Every shot is carefully lit and the lighting is especially great during Nick and Catherine's big sex scene.The music gets a little bit overdramatic at times, but overall really helps to accentuate the film's brooding feel quite nicely.All of the actors do fine work. Michael Douglas is his usual solid self, and George Dzundza adds some much welcomed comic relief as Nick's flustered detective partner Gus. Jeanne Tipplehorn looks great, but her character isn't quite as large as the others, but she does great work with what she had to work with. The rest of the cast are also good. Some of the performances have a quirky tongue-in-cheek quality to them that helps to lighten up the film at various points.But the movie belongs to Sharon Stone. In addition to looking absolutely gorgeous in every scene she's in, Sharon also does a tremendous acting job that got somewhat overlooked by people due to the full-frontal nudity and explicit simulated sex scenes she performed in the film. Her character Catherine really knows how to manipulate people to her advantage and some of the subtle changes she brings in various scenes are truly stupendous. I don't think that I haven't seen many films in which an actress has brought such a natural smoldering sensuality to a role like she did in this. Her work in the infamous interrogation room sequence is a tour-de-force.The plot is what brings this movie down a bit at various points. Written by Joe Eszterhas (before he ended his career with Showgirls), the movie strikes a pretty good balance for the most part. But there are places where it is evident that he got a little more caught up in the sexual excesses of the story instead of supplying a completely coherent plot. This is most evident in the movie's conclusion that raised a lot of debate since it was kind of vague as to who the killer actually was. This isn't Shakespeare, and it does get a little silly at parts, but overall his script gets the job done (even if it is a bit similar to Jagged Edge at times, which he also wrote.) I wish the ending had been a little more fleshed out since it feels just a bit rushed during the final stretch.I really don't think that they exploited the whole lesbian angle nearly as much as they could have. People who blast the film for supposedly putting homosexuals and women in a negative light are really missing the point of the movie IMO.It's been close to 10 years since this film was originally released, and it has aged pretty well. Since this movie, there have been numerous other films that have pushed the envelope much more than this movie did, so now it doesn't seem quite as shocking as it initially did. While it is nowhere near Hitchcock, the fact that they implemented that feel and style into this movie really helped to elevate it and make it much more than just erotic trash.The plot doesn't hold up all the way through, but overall I rank Basic Instinct near the top of it's genre. My 4 (actually make that 4 1/2) star rating is based purely on comparing this movie to other films like it. Sure, if you start comparing this movie to Saving Private Ryan or Gandhi, it's going to not seem that great. But taken for what it is, it is one of the best and a great showcase for Sharon Stone. The combination of violence, explicit sex and sexual ambiguity make Basic Instinct one of the best guilty pleasure films ever made.The recent special edition DVD is chock full of extras. In addition to a commentary track featuring Paul Verhoeven and Jan de Bont, there is also one in which a feminist critic actually ends up praising the film (and she does a great job explaning why.) Anyone who has labled the film as misogynistic would be wise to hear her comments. There are also segments showing the differances between the butchered network T.V. version and the original cut and the expected interviews with the cast and crew. Also, it's presented in its original 2.35:1 widescreen ratio. If you have ever tried watching this film in pan/scan, the widescreen DVD is most welcome indeed!I strongly recommend checking out the unrated director's cut of the this movie versus the censored R-rated version. The unrated cut is much more explicit but also seems more appropriate and smooth.Basic Instinct the director's cut is not rated and contains explicit sexual content, nudity, graphic violence and

73311,A2XTBEWAF272NG,078401020X,Layo,"[0, 0]","I thought it was very like a Dexter romance.  (Straight white guys are portrayed as monsters all the time, but make a movie with a psycho bisexual in it and everyone loses their minds!)  To me, however, the salient detail was that the villain was ridiculously rich.  This gave the young, delicate-looking female protagonist immense power in a man's world.  She was Countess Bathory - bathing in blood, human sacrifices that no one could prevent because of her dominant social position.  In this case, though, she ate people's souls and vomited them up as cheesy paperbacks.Camille Paglia did the commentary in the extras in the DVD I rented.  She thought the icepick was a phallic symbol, but what I thought was cute about it is that it's a clitoris.  Camille thinks that when the murderess employs it, &#34;woman is stealing the phallus&#34;, but nah.  It's a fang, a vagina tooth.  The famous crotch scene was far from gratuitous, it was a threat.The best part for me was when Ms. Psycho-killer tells the guy she's hunting that she intends to know him better than he knows himself.  See, that's one thing I noticed about a lot of Boomers, how their goal is to co-opt the healing arts to violate people psychologically, and that their ultimate goal is to understand the other person better than they understand themselves and then use what they know to pwn that person.  So the icepick is also a scalpel - a sharp, delicate tool of intrusion that you don't feel slipping into your subconscious until she rips you open with it.I feel like Boomers want to do that because their solipsism makes them feel as though nobody else really exists, and they want to force intimacy upon people that's one-way and doesn't threaten their need for control.  So they're sort of obsessed with the mindf*** presented, or rationalized, as a search for the truth.  But the truth is not out there.  People never stop changing, and the prey is always escaping.  So they have to do it serially, whether it's monogamy or murder.  But love is something that enters you, not something you force into someone else.  Their idea of being loved eternally is to force permanent emotional trauma into a person's deepest self - the icepick method of coerced intimacy.  Too bad for that plan, there's really no limit to who we are and what we can be.  Like time, the self is always slipping away.Notice the Water symbolism throughout the movie - water reflections, running through puddles, the rain, the ocean.  The male protagonist is drowning in paranoia as Ms. Psycho wraps her tentacles around him, as does his other girlfriend, a traitorous psychologist.  He feels emotionally raped by her (by both of them), so he date-rapes one of them literally.  He is both creeped out and entranced by the spell the Water puts him under, and finally submits to it (he makes it clear that he would rather not defend himself from her deadly potential than give her up: he lets her make him helpless and doesn't flinch from a sudden lunge) which, unlike his chronic attempt to dominate situations by violence, saves his life.  He made it clear that he'd rather let her kill him than continue to try dominate her in the game they were playing, and thus ultimately have to live without her no matter which of them won.  She wanted to be able to trust someone, but never had been able to because she understood people too well.  Not that this justifies what a total psycho she is, but if you look at the whole thing as a story about Water it's interesting symbolically that the only way to win is to stop fighting (much like when drowning).  She had to learn that too.  Her water was frozen into ice, the icepick was her deadly icicle, because she was afraid of betrayal, I think, or as she explicitly stated, abandonment.That led to an interesting conversation about the difference between strength and power.  If you look at power as aggressive - as the ability to do things, and cause change in the world - and strength as that which does not fall, change or shatter in the face of assault, Water is a source of strength in that it immediately heals, and no matter what state change it experiences it can always resume its former phase.  It also seeps into everything and creates illusions, which gives its passive strength an attribute of invasive, incomprehensible horror.  When we try to use power against it, our fear becomes literalized as death and loss.Many people have talked about the misogyny in this movie.  I feel that it's actually very insightful regarding our terror regarding the emotional world, and its ability to violate our boundaries by revealing layers of ourselves we'd rather keep hidden and bringing up instincts we feel barely able to control.  Relationships aren't usually this brutal, but they can *feel* this brutal.  The movie just made literal the feelings we can have when we get too close to someone else.",4,Water and madness,1396483200,"04 3, 2014",2014,4896,"['thought', 'was', 'very', 'Dexter', 'romance', 'Straight', 'white', 'guys', 'are', 'portrayed', 'monsters', 'time', 'make', 'movie', 'psycho', 'bisexual', 'everyone', 'minds', 'however', 'salient', 'detail', 'was', 'villain', 'was', 'ridiculously', 'rich', 'gave', 'young', 'delicate-looking', 'female', 'protagonist', 'immense', 'power', 'man', 'world', 'was', 'Countess', 'Bathory', 'bathing', 'blood', 'human', 'sacrifices', 'one', 'could', 'prevent', 'dominant', 'social', 'position', 'case', 'ate', 'people', 'souls', 'vomited', 'up', 'cheesy', 'paperbacks.Camille', 'Paglia', 'did', 'commentary', 'extras', 'DVD', 'rented', 'thought', 'icepick', 'was', 'phallic', 'symbol', 'what', 'thought', 'was', 'cute', 'clitoris', 'Camille', 'when', 'murderess', '34', 'woman', 'stealing', 'phallus', '34', 'nah', 'fang', 'vagina', 'tooth', 'famous', 'crotch', 'scene', 'was', 'far', 'gratuitous', 'was', 'threat.The', 'best', 'part', 'was', 'when', 'Ms', 'Psycho-killer', 'guy', 'hunting', 'know', 'better', 'See', 'one', 'thing', 'noticed', 'lot', 'Boomers', 'how', 'goal', 'co-opt', 'healing', 'arts', 'violate', 'people', 'psychologically', 'ultimate', 'goal', 'understand', 'other', 'person', 'better', 'understand', 'then', 'use', 'what', 'know', 'pwn', 'person', 'icepick', 'also', 'scalpel', 'sharp', 'delicate', 'tool', 'intrusion', 'do', ""n't"", 'feel', 'slipping', 'subconscious', 'open', 'it.I', 'feel', 'Boomers', 'want', 'do', 'because', 'solipsism', 'feel', 'nobody', 'else', 'really', 'want', 'force', 'intimacy', 'people', 'one-way', ""n't"", 'threaten', 'need', 'control', ""'re"", 'sort', 'obsessed', 'mindf***', 'presented', 'rationalized', 'search', 'truth', 'truth', 'not', 'there', 'People', 'never', 'stop', 'changing', 'prey', 'always', 'escaping', 'have', 'do', 'serially', 'monogamy', 'murder', 'love', 'something', 'enters', 'not', 'something', 'force', 'someone', 'else', 'idea', 'being', 'loved', 'eternally', 'force', 'permanent', 'emotional', 'trauma', 'person', 'deepest', 'self', 'icepick', 'method', 'coerced', 'intimacy', 'Too', 'bad', 'plan', 'really', 'limit', 'who', 'are', 'what', 'can', 'be', 'time', 'self', 'always', 'slipping', 'away.Notice', 'Water', 'symbolism', 'movie', 'water', 'reflections', 'running', 'puddles', 'rain', 'ocean', 'male', 'protagonist', 'drowning', 'paranoia', 'Ms.', 'Psycho', 'tentacles', 'other', 'girlfriend', 'traitorous', 'psychologist', 'emotionally', 'raped', 'so', 'one', 'literally', 'creeped', 'entranced', 'spell', 'Water', 'finally', 'submits', 'clear', 'would', 'rather', 'not', 'defend', 'deadly', 'potential', 'give', 'up', 'make', 'helpless', ""n't"", 'flinch', 'sudden', 'lunge', 'chronic', 'attempt', 'dominate', 'situations', 'violence', 'life', 'made', 'clear', ""'d"", 'rather', 'let', 'kill', 'continue', 'try', 'dominate', 'game', 'were', 'playing', 'thus', 'ultimately', 'have', 'live', 'matter', 'won', 'wanted', 'be', 'able', 'trust', 'someone', 'never', 'had', 'been', 'able', 'understood', 'people', 'too', 'well', 'Not', 'what', 'total', 'psycho', 'look', 'whole', 'thing', 'story', 'Water', 'interesting', 'symbolically', 'only', 'way', 'win', 'stop', 'fighting', 'much', 'when', 'drowning', 'had', 'learn', 'too', 'water', 'was', 'frozen', 'ice', 'icepick', 'was', 'deadly', 'icicle', 'was', 'afraid', 'betrayal', 'think', 'explicitly', 'stated', 'abandonment.That', 'led', 'interesting', 'conversation', 'difference', 'strength', 'power', 'look', 'power', 'aggressive', 'ability', 'do', 'things', 'cause', 'change', 'world', 'strength', 'not', 'fall', 'change', 'shatter', 'face', 'assault', 'Water', 'source', 'strength', 'immediately', 'heals', 'matter', 'what', 'state', 'change', 'can', 'always', 'resume', 'former', 'phase', 'also', 'everything', 'illusions', 'passive', 'strength', 'attribute', 'invasive', 'incomprehensible', 'horror', 'When', 'try', 'use', 'power', 'fear', 'literalized', 'death', 'loss.Many', 'people', 'have', 'talked', 'misogyny', 'movie', 'feel', 'actually', 'very', 'insightful', 'regarding', 'terror', 'regarding', 'emotional', 'world', 'ability', 'violate', 'boundaries', 'revealing', 'layers', ""'d"", 'rather', 'keep', 'hidden', 'bringing', 'up', 'instincts', 'feel', 'barely', 'able', 'control', 'Relationships', 'are', ""n't"", 'usually', 'brutal', 'can', '*feel*', 'brutal', 'movie', 'just', 'made', 'literal', 'feelings', 'can', 'have', 'when', 'get', 'too', 'close', 'someone', 'else']",N/A

Any scenes featuring Michael - which was the majority of the film unfortunately - shaking his bare booty. I'd already been scarred for life by that image in Fatal Attraction, and you do see a lot more of it in this film. Not pleasant.My other horrible point, but not so much a horrible point, more of a statement, is of course, the infamous leg crossing scene. I'd never really seen it in any clips or anything, but had heard enough about it. Surprisingly, it happens quite early on in the film. I thought it would have happened at least half way through. This scene was unbelievable. It probably spawned a generation of men who remember having some pleasure to that scene. But my quibble, as a woman, is there's not much there to see! It's more letting your imagination run wild. For me, there wasn't much interest, but I can imagine there are plenty of pre-teen/early teenage boys out there, who have watched that scene over and over. The first shot you see the crease of her legs in the middle (nothing more), and the second shot, you definitely don't see much more than the very top, and it doesn't look like she shaved! That's it though. All the hype about that one scene. There was also a huge hoo-ha that Sharon CLAIMS she had no idea Paul Verhoeven was filming that particular area in the interrogation scene, and when she saw the rushes, she slapped him, and ordered him to remove it. Without that scene, I don't think the film would have got so much publicity, and might have died a death. Paul Verhoeven denies the above ever happened. But I like the fact that at the start of the scene, the policemen are in charge, then she opens her legs, and they turn into drooling idiots. Talk about turning the tables.I was instantly put off by how much I hated that scene, and was about to change my mind, but decided to keep watching. It did happen quite early on. I was quite shocked at how GRAPHIC the bedroom scenes were. I mean it's nothing on what goes on online these days, but for me, it looked so realistic. (So glad I didn't watch it with my mum, I would have been blushing!) They were extremely realistic, which added a different element to the film. Some bedroom scenes are so faked (or body doubles), or there's zero chemistry between the actors but this seemed very realistic, although I've seen better than Michael Douglas.The actors were all very good. I liked Jeanne Tripplehorn's character, she was more superior to Sharon's and she should have had more screen time, she's always excellent in anything she does (although I do get muddled up between her & Parker Posey.) Sharon did a good job of her role, and made it so much more than the stereotyped vixen it could have been.Although it was slightly long for my liking, it was still good, but it could have done with a very small amount of editing, just to make it run smoother. There were occasional moments when I was looking at my watch, or looking at the display to see how long it had left.If Basic Instinct had been a book first - now THAT could have been interesting. A book about someone writing a book that then happens in real life ... Ooh, I'm confused.It's an absolutely amazing story too. Much better than the murder-by-numbers I was expecting. There were so many twists and turns, and on a second viewing (yes there will be!), there will be quite a few clues to spot. I definitely think the director was playing games with the viewers in this, as it constantly jumps back and forth and keeps you second-guessing about who the killer really is. Even now, after watching the film, reading various posts on IMDB, and reading other reviews, I'm still undecided as to who the killer was. I think there are at least a couple of characters in the frame, but at one point during the film, you are led to believe there's a third who could possibly be the killer.The score was excellent too. At points I didn't notice it - which is always the best score in my opinion, rather than one full of stingers. I have heard one part of the score before, the part over the first bedroom scene between Michael & Sharon, yes it was good, but it's so much better when you see the scenes that accompany it. It makes it that more powerful than just the music by itself.I was very impressed with Basic Instinct, and will definitely be watching it again, just to satisfy my curiosity about the clues littered throughout the film, which I think there are plenty of. I also definitely want to watch it again, to try and figure out the killer definitely is. I'm not sure how to end my review, how to sum it up. I'm intrigued to see comparisons to ""The Fourth Man"", also by Paul Verhoeven, so that might need to go on my list of DVDs to get. But I definitely suggest if you haven't seen this movie, you snap it up. It's an excellent movie, and I thoroughly enjoyed it.",4,"A brilliant movie, tarnished with a reputation",1168387200,"01 10, 2007",2007,5148,"[""'d"", 'got', 'present', 'Christmas', 'mum', 'already',

I think I must have just seen scenes when I was younger and assumed I had seen the whole thing.  There a great deal of gratuitous sex in this film, but there is also a quite a good deal of suspense and old school tension that used to be found in the noir thrillers of the 30's and 40's.  I loved Sharon Stone in this.  I can now see why she became a star so quickly.  Michael Douglas is always good so his brilliant performance wasn't a surprise to me.  But the real standout for me was actually Jeanne Tripplehorn.  She was incredible.  Paul Verhoeven is one of my favorite filmmakers at the moment.  He has made so versatile films everything from medieval (i.e. Flesh and Blood) to science fiction (i.e. Starship Troopers, Robocop and Total Recall), sexual thrillers (The 4th Man, Basic Instinct and Showgirls), horror films (i.e. Hollow Man), and war films (i.e. Soldier of Orange).

73328,AL4MKKO24563R,078401020X,Michael K. Beusch,"[12, 15]","It's hilarious how worked up people got when this movie came out. The PC crowd decried the fact that a lesbian was the killer and, therefore, must have been the villan. The right wing crowd then immediately accused the PC crowd of being too hysterical about the alleged prejudice against homosexuals. Basic Instinct, they contended, was bad because it was a dirty movie. The producers, of course, loved all this publicity because EVERYONE went running to see the move and, in the words of Liberace, cried all the way to the bank. Telling audiences to not see a film because of homosexual activity and graphic sex scenes is like trying to scare ants away from a picnic by pouring sugar on the ground.First of all, Sharon Stone's Catherine Trammell who is the killer lesbian (actually bisexual) in question, IS THE MOST SYMPATHETIC character in the whole film! EVERYONE is a slimebag! From Michael Douglas' hot tempered, tourist killing, chain smoking, cocaine snorting, oversexed police detective to Jeanne Tripplehorn's neurotic, kinky police psychiastrist who is more messed up than any of her patients to the rest of the morally compromised sleazes who pass for cops who laugh at murder victims and have the compassion and sensitivity of storm troopers, EVERY single character in this movie is a cesspool of a person! The way I see it, Sharon Stone is the most sympathetic person in the entire film -- at least she makes no bones about being sleazy. If you take the position that lesbians should be offended by their negative portrayal in Basic Instinct, then you could say the same for psychiatrists, cops (especially members of the SFPD), mystery writers, drug addicts, San Franciscans, smokers, country/western fans, chilli eaters, Mustang drivers and basically all human beings in general.Of course, the right wing is just as clueless when it comes to Basic Instinct. I went to see Basic Instinct BECAUSE of all the sex in the movie! Anyone who tells you that they saw Basic Instinct for any reason other than to see loads of nudity and sex is so full of it, they should be slapped! I went to see Sharon Stone's nether regions in the police interrogation scene. I went to see the sex scene between Douglas and Stone that seems to go on for about half the movie (although I had to wait until the home video release to see ALL of the sex scene -- what a rip-off!). I went to see Sharon Stone display the wares she only hinted at having in Total Recall. I WANTED TO SEE SEX AND NUDITY AND, BY GOD, THAT'S WHY I WENT TO SEE BASIC INSTINCT!!! So many hypocritical prudes tsk tsk at all of the sex in movies today. Get a clue! This movie is like a huge bug zapper: drawing us in with loads of sex and nudity even though we're going to get zapped when we realize what a piece of sleazy trash we're watching (Joe Ezsterhaus must read tons of pornography in order to form his views of women).But please don't get me wrong, this is INSPIRED sleaze that I am wholeheartedly recommending you at least rent, if not purchase. It may be sleaze, but it's really, really enjoyable sleaze which will have you ""standing at attention"" for a long, long time afterward (even after you see not one, but two, gratuitous shots of Michael Douglas' butt). And for those of you who have moral objections to Basic Instinct, please, go out and get a life!",3,"Sex, sex, sex, sex and more sex.

73331,A39SJ6V6QCGC37,078401020X,Midge,"[1, 4]","When this movie was originally released in theaters, there was a huge controversy from protests by various gay groups who were incensed that the villain swung both ways. You don't see straights protesting each time a straight villain is used in a film. It was utter nonsense. Anyone of any persuasion can be a villain in real life or on a film.Living in the SF area at the time Basic Instinct came out, which was the hot seat of protest groups; the groundless fuss and hysterics from the gay groups trying to impress their biased censorship into the film industry... infuriated the rest of us. So, to express our disdain for their protests and their efforts to censor the movies for the rest of the world... the public turned out in droves at the theaters to watch Basic Instinct. If it had not been for the protests, the movie turnout probably would have been 1/10th as big... or less. Most of us normally would not have watched such a sexually explicit movie at home... much less go to a theater to watch it... thus, the protesters only succeeded in bolstering the magnitude of the original turnout at the theaters by at least a factor of 10 if not more. We all felt this way at the time and it was a common topic of discussion among everyone that we would all go to see the movie to thwart the ridiculous protests and their unacceptable efforts to control this movie.If they had not made such an unreasonable fuss, the movie would have had a low turnout because the amount of explicit sex was offensive and shocking to the majority of us who went to watch it. We did not have graphic movies like this on a general basis for public consumption as you might see in this day and age... so it was shocking.  The raw sex scenes were even excessive for most of the males I knew who went to see the movie as an anti-protest to the protesters. As for the leg crossing scene, you can't see anything even if you freeze frame it... despite what some people may claim. That scene paled in comparison with the rawness of the other sex scenes in the movie... all due to the French Director who also decided that the actors were not allowed to wear protection. He endangered their health for no justifiable reason.However, the movie was well written and had an excellent storyline. The movie would have been a lot better without the explicit sex scenes... but to this day, they still don't realize that the huge audience turnout was a counter reaction toward the protests at that time. It was their excessive raving over the movie which incited such an overwhelming number of people to rush to the theaters in response. The protesters only managed to bring hundreds of thousands of additional people out of their homes to see this movie, who normally would not have cross the street to watch it for free. This was the main topic of conversation in California at that time because the protests infuriated the public with such intensity. For those who do not know, the protesters were using vile methods to prevent & interfere with the filming of this movie. Some of these details are included in the special features included on the DVD.We strongly felt if one special interest group managed to force their censorship upon the film industry, it would set a terrible precedent for every special interest group... and would eventually lead to gross intolerable censorship of every film by every type of special interest group until we would eventually end up with no films at all.Since there was no controversy like this regarding Basic Instinct 2, it did not enjoy the huge turnout as the first movie. Again, the film makers did not understand why the box office turnouts had low results for the sequel. The second movie also had an excellent storyline... but once again, too much raw sex scenes. They did not understand that the public was never interested in watching these raw scenes. The people who like those types of scenes usually do their shopping in the adult sections and are not looking for storyline quality. They are a small minority of theater audiences since they usually view their movies at home.Again, the storylines were quite excellent and well written. However, the male lead on Basic Instinct 2 did not have the charisma of Michael Douglas. In fact, the male lead on the sequel was completely unappealing. (not to mention the fact that they had also cast a Harry Potter Professor Lupin favorite as an incredibly foul mouthed, crooked police detective in the sequel... which was not a pleasant role to watch such a popular actor portray.)They could probably make a third sequel if they would get rid of the explicit scenes and find a better male lead. There might be a few people who would be gung ho for the explicit scenes... but the majority of the theater audience does not care to see that level of graphic sexual details... and this majority is the core audience which provides the money and turnout each new movie is based upon.It is coming to the point where people would rather watch movies at home and not in a theater, so the film makers need to start finding another way to release new movies for the public to watch from their homes. It is not lack of interest in the movies causing low turnouts... it is a lack of desire to go sit in some theater which is diminishing the turnouts. New movies should be released in DVD, online, pay channels and other home media formats instead of theaters. I think in less than 10 years, most theaters will be out of business except for a small handful of specialty formats which cannot be duplicated at home... such as IMAX. The film industry needs to look at this now instead of basing their ratings and revenues on theater distribution.If you are going to watch Basic Instinct for the first time... beware of the graphic, unprotected sex and violence. Do not allow children or minors under 21 to watch it.",4,Orig turnout due to protests,1320796800,"11 9, 2011",2011,5863,"['When', 'movie', 'was', 'originally', 'released', 'theaters', 'was', 'huge',

The movie transfer looked and sounded excellent with plenty of supplemental information and commentaries.However, the packaging design left me wondering what the designer was thinking about. First of all, it is impossible to open the plastic box with the hinges not moving at all. I am sure many people today broke the &quot;stupid&quot; box at the hinges that houses the DVD. At first I tried to open it the normal way with no avil. Then I carefully separate the box into two parts by unhinging it. Now I have the box in two different parts.The second bad design about the packaging is that the DVD doesn't stay in the retainer on the first part (top) of the box. The retainer is just not tight enough to hold the DVD securely. When I tried to place the DVD back in the box, it just keep falling off the retainer that supposedly holds the DVD in place.It is unfortunate that we (the consumer) need to shell out additional money to buy a replacement DVD case.

73337,A2Z9FXHC1L66EW,078401020X,"Mr. ""alan5973""","[157, 164]","Basic Instinct is certainly a film that has not only aged well with time, it makes you wish they could still make a sexy erotic thriller this good today.  With so much political correctness going on these days, a film like Basic Instinct would never be made quite the same way, had it been made today.  Attacked while it was being filmed for it's quote &quot;negative depictions of the Gay community&quot; as well as a so called &quot;date rape&quot; scene, the film became controversial practically the day it became green lit.Sharon Stone became an overnight sensation portraying the rich, seductive &amp; powerful Catherine Tramell, a role that seemed tailor made for the actress.  But in fact director Paul Verhoeven (Robocop, Starship Troopers) had to fight hard to prove to both Carolco Pictures and actor Michael Douglas that she was in fact the only person suited for the role.  Having worked with Stone on his last picture, Total Recall (1990), Verhoeven knew that Stone had something special to give to the part and he finally got that message through to all those mentioned.  I'd go so far to say that with the exception of her Oscar nominated performance in Martin Scorsese's Casino, Catherine Tramell is still Sharon Stone's best performance.So what's the big deal between the R-rated &amp; Unrated versions of Basic Instinct?  Basically a little more violence and a little more sex.  There's more stabs with the ice pick in the Unrated version (about 3 or 4), more shots of the victim actually being stabbed (courtesy of a man made puppet designed by Rob Bottin) and that's about it for the violence.  The added sex has mainly to do with the first encounter between Michael Douglas's Nick Curran, and Sharon Stone's Catherine Tramell.  The added scenes are hot &amp; very well done, but overall, the result is still the same.  The only other difference is the Unrated version includes an audio commentary with director Paul Verhoeven and director of photography Jan De Bont.  This commentary is not available on the R-rated version.  But both versions do include the 2nd commentary by Feminist critic, Camille Paglia, who praises the film as one of her all time favorite movies.  Her commentary is quite informative and really gave me a lot of insight into the film that I never noticed before.  Those of you who own the Special Edition Laserdisc that came out a few years back should be urged not to get rid of it.  It's special features are quite different from those on these DVD versions.  Even the Paul Verhoevan Commentary is different from the one on the DVD.  Plus the DVD doesn't give you the option of viewing the final shot of the film with the alternate scoring conducted by Jerry Goldmith, although it is shown during the making of documentary.  Still worth keeping.I personally love how much the movie feels like an Alfred Hitchcock film.  The dress Sharon wheres for the interrogation scene is very similar to the one Kim Novak wore in Vertigo.  There are many references to Vertigo in the film, as well as The Birds, North By Northwest, Rear Window and a few others.  This adds a lot of class to the picture that only enhances its creativeness.  It may be a long time before another picture comes close to matching it.Basic Instinct..destined to become a classic!&quot;I hate rugrats&quot;. - Sharon Stone as Catherine Tramell",5,"%$&amp;# Like Minks,Raise a Few Rugrats,Live Happily Ever After.",1001721600,"09 29, 2001",2001,3356,"['Basic', 'Instinct', 'certainly', 'film', 'not', 'only', 'aged', 'well', 'time', 'wish', 'could', 'still', 'make', 'sexy', 'erotic', 'thriller', 'good', 'today', 'so', 'much', 'political', 'correctness', 'going', 'days', 'film', 'Basic', 'Instinct', 'would', 'never', 'be', 'made', 'quite', 'same', 'way', 'had', 'been', 'made', 'today', 'Attacked', 'was', 'being', 'filmed', 'quote', 'quot', 'negative', 'depictions', 'Gay', 'community', 'quot', 'as', 'well', 'so', 'called', 'quot', 'date', 'rape', 'quot', 'scene', 'film', 'became', 'controversial', 'practically', 'day', 'became', 'green', 'lit.Sharon', 'Stone', 'became', 'overnight', 'sensation', 'portraying', 'rich', 'seductive', 'amp', 'powerful', 'Catherine', 'Tramell', 'role', 'seemed', 'tailor', 'made', 'actress', 'fact', 'director', 'Paul', 'Verhoeven', 'Robocop', 'Starship', 'Troopers', 'had', 'fight', 'hard', 'prove', 'Carolco', 'Pictures', 'actor', 'Michael', 'Douglas', 'was', 'fact', 'only', 'person', 'suited', 'role', 'Having', 'worked', 'Stone', 'last', 'picture', 'Total', 'Recall', '1990', 'Verhoeven', 'knew', 'Stone', 'had', 'something', 'special', 'give', 'part', 'finally', 'got', 'message', 'mentioned', ""'d"", 'go', 'so', 'far', 'say', 'exception', 'Oscar', 'nominated', 'performance', 'Martin', 'Scorsese', 'Casino', 'Catherine', 'Tramell', 'still', 'Sharon', 'Stone', 'best', 'performance.So', 'what', 'big', 'deal', 'R-rated', 'amp', 'Unrated', 'versions', 'Basic', 'Instinct', 'Basically', 'little', 'more', 'violence', 'little', 'more', 'sex', 'more', 'stabs', 'ice', 'pick', 'Unrated', 'version', '3', '4', 'more', 'shots', 'victim', 'actually', 'being', 'stabbed', 'courtesy', 'man', 'made', 'puppet', 'designed', 'Rob', 'Bottin', 'violence', 'added', 'sex', 'mainly', 'do', 'first', 'encounter', 'Michael', 'Douglas', 'Nick', 'Curran', 'Sharon', 'Stone', 'Catherine', 'Tramell', 'added', 'scenes', 'are', 'hot', 'amp', 'very', 'well', 'done', 'overall', 'result', 'still', 'same', 'only', 'other', 'difference', 'Unrated', 'version', 'audio', 'commentary', 'director', 'Paul', 'Verhoeven', 'director', 'photography', 'Jan', 'De', 'Bont', 'commentary', 'not', 'available', 'R-rated', 'version', 'versions', 'do', 'include', '2nd', 'commentary', 'Feminist', 'critic', 'Camille', 'Paglia', 'who', 'film', 'one', 'time', 'favorite', 'movies', 'commentary', 'quite', 'informative', 'really', 'gave', 'lot', 'insight', 'film', 'never', 'noticed', 'who', 'own', 'Special', 'Edition', 'Laserdisc', 'came', 'out', 'few', 'years', 'back', 'should', 'be', 'urged', 'not', 'get', 'rid', 'special', 'features', 'are', 'quite', 'different', 'DVD', 'versions', 'Even', 'Paul', 'Verhoevan', 'Commentary', 'different', 'one', 'DVD', 'DVD', ""n't"", 'give', 'option', 'viewing', 'final', 'shot', 'film', 'alternate', 'scoring', 'conducted', 'Jerry', 'Goldmith', 'shown', 'making', 'documentary', 'Still', 'worth', 'keeping.I', 'personally', 'love', 'how', 'much', 'movie', 'feels', 'Alfred', 'Hitchcock', 'film', 'dress', 'Sharon', 'interrogation', 'scene', 'very', 'similar', 'one', 'Kim', 'Novak', 'wore', 'Vertigo', 'are', 'many', 'references', 'Vertigo', 'film', 'as', 'well', 'Birds', 'North', 'Northwest', 'Rear', 'Window', 'few', 'others', 'lot', 'class', 'picture', 'only', 'creativeness', 'may', 'be', 'long', 'time', 'picture', 'close', 'matching', 'it.Basic', 'Instinct..destined', 'become', 'classic', 'quot', 'hate', 'rugrats', 'quot', 'Sharon', 'Stone', 'Catherine', 'Tramell']",N/A

If there is a full screen version of this movie, the production company should make that clear. And if there is no full screen version of Basic Instinct, why isn't there?

This came out when I was in high school, but I didn't see it until after I had graduated... but I remember the hype about it being ""racy"".  I really didn't know what to think of it at first... but after seeing it a few times, it grew on me.  Maybe it's the sex... or crime drama thriller... killers getting away with killing... or a combination of the above.  I remember hearing & reading about Stone's mixed-review performance beforehand, but after seeing it for myself, I personally thought it fit the character.  You can never really trust her, although at times you almost want to.  I hadn't even really seen Douglas in any movies before this.  If you liked this, than Fatal Attraction is a must see as well (I didn't see FA until after this one).  Throw in here a beautiful score by Jerry Goldsmith (which as a classical musician I noticed), as well what has become one of my favorite dance tracks since I heard it in high school, La Tour's ""Blue"" from the dance club scene with Roxy.As far as flaws, I have to agree with another reviewer about the realism of her antics as she's getting questioned.  What's wrong with these guys, & what really makes her so special?  They really haven't seen anything like her, as the polygraph guy says?  That's the main thing that bothered me, but it's a movie, & as long as you know that, don't take it too seriously.  There are lots of funny moments, esp. with Curran's friend Gus... ""that's that magna cum laude ***** that done fried up your brain!""  I didn't know this was the same director as Starship Troopers & Showgirls, but this is by far better of the 3.

It is not as data dense (12-22mbps) as say Avatar (20-50mbps), but it is enjoyable to watch both on the 2.35:1 letterbox setting and my HDTV's 1.85:1 zoom setting.  DVD's generally do not zoom well, losing sharpness.Movie review: I previously avoided adding Basic Instinct to my film library because the theatrical version, though good, felt crimped by the obvious censorship.  The timing and flow of the movie-house version reminded me of listening to a favorite vinyl record that skips during the best songs; you thoroughly enjoy the song right up to the distracting skip, then you get annoyed or upset.  Hoping for the best I purchased the Unrated Director's Cut, praying it removed the skips and annoyances.  It did.  The uncensored scenes, though not necessarily any more graphic, play the movie's rhythm perfectly, leaving the viewer scene satisfied while building the segue to the next chapter.

Penna ""Dr. Bob""","[8, 10]","With all the buzz surrounding the release of Basic Instinct 2 (""Will Sharon Stone look as good nude at 48 as she did at 34?""), I got a hold of this Director's Cut and decided to see the original.  I'd never seen it in '92, turned off by all the hype surrounding Stone's ""leg crossing"" scene.  I should have stuck to my original instincts.Yes, there is suspense in this movie:  Is Stone really the killer?  Unfortunately, that question was never definitively answered...which set up the opening for today's long delayed release of the sequel. But unlike the ""classic"" movies which transcend their own era and bring a compelling story or characters to any time they may be viewed, this movie now comes across like That 70's Show, so mired in the artificial conventions of the time in which it was filmed that it is an embarrassment when seen today; sort of like having someone show the pictures of you in your leisure suit and platform shoes of 30 years ago.  You can't believe you actually ever dressed like that.I am not sure that ANYONE was ever as hip, cool, liberated, and callous as the character in this film are supposed to be, but what comes across today is a cast of quite unlikable people acting in ways that defy logic.  I can't, for example, imagine Michael Douglas making this movie today, and not simply because he's too old to pull it off.  Rather, the reason would seem to be that we have all matured past the pseudo-cynical ""edge"" that his ""Nick"" displays throughout this film.  Indeed, for all the panting and brow furrowing, the only characters the viewer really winds up caring about are Nick's therapist-girlfriend (who is apparently and successfully framed for the crimes committed by Stone's character, and who then meets an unfortunate end), and his down-to-earth partner, who meets a similar and related fate.It was sensationalism and sex that sold this movie 14 years ago; but sensationalism wears off, and sex is now available literally anywhere.  Those attractions taken away, this film and the execution of its basic story simply do not hold up.  In short, I am glad I passed this film by 14 years ago, I am sorry I spent the time to see it now, and there is no really reason for a sequel.",2,Original Instincts,1143763200,"03 31, 2006",2006,2217,"['buzz', 'surrounding', 'release', 'Basic', 'Instinct', '2', 'Will', 'Sharon', 'Stone', 'look', 'good', 'nude', '48', 'did', '34', 'got', 'hold', 'Director', 'Cut', 'decided', 'see', 'original', ""'d"", 'never', 'seen', ""'92"", 'turned', 'off', 'hype', 'surrounding', 'Stone', 'leg', 'crossing', 'scene', 'should', 'have', 'stuck', 'original', 'instincts.Yes', 'suspense', 'movie', 'Stone', 'really', 'killer', 'Unfortunately', 'question', 'was', 'never', 'definitively', 'answered', 'set', 'up', 'opening', 'today', 'long', 'delayed', 'release', 'sequel', 'classic', 'movies', 'transcend', 'own', 'era', 'bring', 'compelling', 'story', 'characters', 'time', 'may', 'be', 'viewed', 'movie', 'now', '70', 'Show', 'so', 'mired', 'artificial', 'conventions', 'time', 'was', 'filmed', 'embarrassment', 'when', 'seen', 'today', 'sort', 'having', 'someone', 'show', 'pictures', 'leisure', 'suit', 'platform', 'shoes', '30', 'years', 'ago', 'ca', ""n't"", 'believe', 'actually', 'ever', 'dressed', 'that.I', 'am', 'not', 'sure', 'ANYONE', 'was', 'ever', 'hip', 'cool', 'liberated', 'callous', 'character', 'film', 'are', 'supposed', 'be', 'what', 'today', 'cast', 'quite', 'unlikable', 'people', 'acting', 'ways', 'defy', 'logic', 'ca', ""n't"", 'example', 'imagine', 'Michael', 'Douglas', 'making', 'movie', 'today', 'not', 'simply', 'too', 'old', 'pull', 'off', 'Rather', 'reason', 'would', 'seem', 'be', 'have', 'matured', 'pseudo-cynical', 'edge', 'Nick', 'film', 'Indeed', 'panting', 'brow', 'furrowing', 'only', 'viewer', 'really', 'up', 'caring', 'are', 'Nick', 'therapist-girlfriend', 'who', 'apparently', 'successfully', 'framed', 'crimes', 'committed', 'Stone', 'character', 'who', 'then', 'unfortunate', 'end', 'down-to-earth', 'partner', 'who', 'similar', 'related', 'fate.It', 'was', 'sensationalism', 'sex', 'sold', 'movie', '14', 'years', 'ago', 'sensationalism', 'wears', 'sex', 'now', 'available', 'literally', 'anywhere', 'attractions', 'taken', 'away', 'film', 'execution', 'basic', 'story', 'simply', 'do', 'not', 'hold', 'up', 'short', 'am', 'glad', 'passed', 'film', '14', 'years', 'ago', 'am', 'sorry', 'spent', 'time', 'see', 'now', 'really', 'reason', 'sequel']",N/A
73357,A2OVR63TMZ8FJJ,078401020X,Robin McDonald,"[11, 13]","As a child, future director Paul Verhoven's playground was the recently bombed out homes of his neighbors. The absurd violence in the world seems to be reflected in all his movies. I have been involved with four Verhoven films while on the Rob Bottin effects crew. Verhoven made a name for himself directing the edgy and funny &quot;Robocop&quot; originally receiving an X-Rating for the violence in his director's cut. Total Recall and Starship Troopers are other wild examples of his romance with ultra violence. He has always made films that push limits of acceptable social boundaries. Before he directed Showgirls he tested the public's tolerance for a sex with buckets of blood with his thriller Basic Instinct.Basic Instinct is a Hitchcock style murder thriller featuring Sharon Stone who is &quot;dressed to kill&quot; as famous author Catherine Trammel (a dead ringer for Kim Novak in Vertigo) A violent icepick murder seems to have been taken right out of her recent novel. Arrogant and cool, she actually invites the police investigators to wonder if she did it in the now legendary interogation scene where she crosses her legs and shoots Detective Curran (Michael Douglas) an eyeful of her unpantied intimate territory. Curran is investigates her a little too closely and compromises his integrity by getting ensnared in her sexual web. Did she do it or is it the copycat work of a crazed fan? Even intimately close to the suspect Detective Curran doesn't really know for sure.Even though this is the unrated director's cut you won't find some of the most extremely gory footage. Stone shot a scene in the nude where she straddled a realistic torso of a victim  repeatedly plunging the icepick into the chest and face. Splattered with fake blood and feeling in her arm the sensation of the pick piercing this rubbery body, the illusion was all too real. Sharon became nauseous and had to leave the set. Also missing Gus (George Dzunza) takes a nasty icepick in the cheek. Basic Instinct is a stylish and dark film that can be frustrating and uncomfortable as it never quite fully allows you to know all its secrets. But it is intriguing none-the-less.Personally I was always uneasy with the boundaries Verhoven likes to push but this is a better film than expected. Verhoven has had several unfulfilled dreams to push even harder but so far has been thwarted. For example &quot;Crusade&quot; Another Arnold movie quashed in negotiations &quot;Crusades&quot; had a scene where Scharzenneger is found with his head sticking out of the backside of a donkey's rear end. Verhoven often joked with Rob Bottin about making a film designed to enrage his critics called Jesus 2000. Rob thinks he would have seriously done it if he was given the money.Overall if you are a fan of Basic Instinct there is a lot for you on this disc. Two commentaries. One by Verhoven and the other by a feminist author as well as deleted scenes and some behind the scenes featurettes. The novelty plastic case with plastic ice pick was probably a bad idea as the hinges break very easily.

73362,A1TK6R2JSC97HL,078401020X,Rottenberg's rotten book review,"[2, 3]","Michael Douglas and Sharon Stone use sex as a weapon as Douglas's character investigates the shocking murder of one of Stone's lovers. More of an acquaintance she slept with than a lover, the aging rock star is repeatedly stabbed with an ice-pick, the same fate met by a fictitious rock star in a torrid novel Stone's character had written. The book so baldly links Stone's character to the murder that it's less a clue than an alibi. (Who would be crazy enough to commit a horrible crime and essentially confess by selling a ficionalized version of the gory event at $5.99 a-pop to beachgoers and frequent fliers?) Though Douglas, as ""Nicky"", pursues the case with an eye towards collaring Stone's Catherine Trammel, nobody else on his force will touch her - some are in awe of her as fans, or simply don't want to try pinning the murder based on her book.  It soon becomes clear that nobody really likes Nick - his partner, played by ""Law & Order"" alum George Dzunda, is one of his few friends on the force, but even he admits that he's in the minority; a former lover played by Jeanne Tripplehorn also has a rocky relationship to Nick -  she's also the PD psychiatrist, and Nicky's given her enough material to write a book of her own.  When Nick remains determined to get even closer to Trammel, we quickly learn that he has a history himself (Stone calls him ""Nicky"" like his ex-wife used to and, to really clue him in to his transparency, ""Shooter""; it seems that Nicky has a rep for jumping to conclusions with his police 9mm), and Stone's Catherine Tramell turns his demons against him. Nevertheless, Tramell needs Nick - he's the perfect model for a character in one of her new books. They duel (mostly in bed) but the script tosses in some other players: Roxy - one of Catherine's lovers and Jeanne Tripplehorn (who may have a history of her own w/Trammel); and let's not forget a pre-Newman Wayne Knight as a chainsmoking detective in the infamous interrogation scene.This movie generated a lot of controversy, but the biggest surprises aren't sexual at all - instead, the script repeatedly shocks with its unsublety, dropping hints like anvils - Tripplehorn's having known Trammel in HS, Trammel's telling Nick of having been stalked by a fellow classmate in college, a student who tried to assume Catherine's identity - as if we're too stupid or lazy to connect the dots before the last 1/2 hour!  As a mystery, ""Instinct"" is a total failure - dispensing with any of the remotely intelligent plot devices of mystery - as motive and opportunity - instead characters die almost at random (the murder victim himself is a cypher, an innocent bystander whose death was needed to get the story going and gets tossed once Nicky's on duty).  Even the sex isn't sexy - mostly it's just violent, less seductive than kinetic. For a flick about a sexual predator, ""Basic Instinct"" isn't remotely arousing.",2,overrated romp,1025740800,"07 4, 2002",2002,2906,"['Michael', 'Douglas', 'Sharon', 'Stone', 'use', 'sex', 'weapon', 'Douglas', 'character', 'shocking', 'murder', 'one', 'Stone', 'lovers', 'More', 'acquaintance', 'slept', 'lover', 'aging', 'rock', 'star', 'repeatedly', 'stabbed', 'ice-pick', 'same', 'fate', 'met', 'fictitious', 'rock', 'star', 'torrid', 'novel', 'Stone', 'character', 'had', 'written', 'book', 'so', 'baldly', 'Stone', 'character', 'murder', 'less', 'clue', 'alibi', 'Who', 'would', 'be', 'crazy', 'enough', 'commit', 'horrible', 'crime', 'essentially', 'confess', 'selling', 'ficionalized', 'version', 'gory', 'event', '5.99', 'a-pop', 'beachgoers', 'frequent', 'fliers', 'Douglas', 'Nicky', 'case', 'eye', 'towards', 'collaring', 'Stone', 'Catherine', 'Trammel', 'nobody', 'else', 'force', 'will', 'touch', 'are', 'awe', 'fans', 'simply', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'try', 'pinning', 'murder', 'based', 'book', 'soon', 'clear', 'nobody', 'really', 'Nick', 'partner', 'played', 'Law', 'Order', 'alum', 'George', 'Dzunda', 'one', 'few', 'friends', 'force', 'even', 'minority', 'former', 'lover', 'played', 'Jeanne', 'Tripplehorn', 'also', 'rocky', 'relationship', 'Nick', 'also', 'PD', 'psychiatrist', 'Nicky', 'given', 'enough', 'material', 'write', 'book', 'own', 'When', 'Nick', 'determined', 'get', 'even', 'closer', 'Trammel', 'quickly', 'learn', 'history', 'Stone', 'Nicky', 'ex-wife', 'used', 'really', 'clue', 'transparency', 'Shooter', 'Nicky', 'rep', 'jumping', 'conclusions', 'police', '9mm', 'Stone', 'Catherine', 'Tramell', 'demons', 'Nevertheless', 'Tramell', 'Nick', 'perfect', 'model', 'character', 'one', 'new', 'books', 'duel', 'mostly', 'bed', 'script', 'other', 'players', 'Roxy', 'one', 'Catherine', 'lovers', 'Jeanne', 'Tripplehorn', 'who', 'may', 'have', 'history', 'own', 'w/Trammel', 'let', 'not', 'forget', 'pre-Newman', 'Wayne', 'Knight', 'chainsmoking', 'detective', 'infamous', 'interrogation', 'scene.This', 'movie', 'generated', 'lot', 'controversy', 'biggest', 'surprises', 'are', ""n't"", 'sexual', 'instead', 'script', 'repeatedly', 'unsublety', 'dropping', 'hints', 'anvils', 'Tripplehorn', 'having', 'known', 'Trammel', 'HS', 'Trammel', 'telling', 'Nick', 'having', 'been', 'stalked', 'fellow', 'classmate', 'college', 'student', 'who', 'tried', 'assume', 'Catherine', 'identity', ""'re"", 'too', 'stupid', 'lazy', 'connect', 'dots', 'last', '1/2', 'hour', 'mystery', 'Instinct', 'total', 'failure', 'dispensing', 'remotely', 'intelligent', 'plot', 'devices', 'mystery', 'motive', 'opportunity', 'instead', 'characters', 'die', 'almost', 'random', 'murder', 'victim', 'cypher', 'innocent', 'bystander', 'death', 'was', 'needed', 'get', 'story', 'going', 'tossed', 'once', 'Nicky', 'duty', 'Even', 'sex', ""n't"", 'sexy', 'mostly', 'just', 'violent', 'less', 'seductive', 'kinetic', 'flick', 'sexual', 'predator', 'Basic', 'Instinct', ""n't"", 'remotely', 'arousing']",N/A

I didn't like it in 1992, and watching the full uncut DVD version in 2004 I still feel the same.BASIC INSTINCT tries to be a Hitchcock type film in many ways.  Firstly, it has an annoying 'suspense' music score that plays throughout the film even when a scene doesn't warrant it.  Next, the film reveals the killer but attempts to leaves you wondering if he/she is the real killer.  The problem with BASIC INSTINCT is that it is so obvious that Sharon Stone is the killer. Not that we really care, afterall the storyline is so sleazy, that you feel no empathy for any of the characters.The film relied on lots of erotic images to sell the film, and there is a reason for that.  The Director must have realised from the begining that it was very ordinary storyline, and needed something to make it appealing.  Problem solved: include lots of erotic images and a naked Sharon Stone ... and people will go to and see it for that alone. Clever marketing.DVD SUMMARY:  Basic Instinct has been released three times now on DVD, its first release way back in 1997.  The version I saw was the second version which sports a DTS soundtrack, and some interesting special features.  These include a &quot;comparison with TV and Uncut version&quot;, and a documentary on the &quot;making of&quot; which reveals the problems that plagued the film set in San Fran.

Nick is continualy in trouble with internal affairs and has a very bad habit of shooting his weapon and killing people on the job. He is nicknamed, with strong affection, as ""Shooter"".Sharon Stone's film career flew after the release of ""Basic Instinct"". What a great role for her playing the sexy, manipulative, dominant, intelligent, and seductive Catherine Tramell. Director Paul Verhoeven calls her a devil. She might be. Her eyes are amazing. You never quite know what exactly she is thinking.Douglas is in charge of finding the killer of an aging rock star. His search leads him to Stone and there the cat and mouse game begins. Douglas and Stone's characters both lie, cheat and manipulate the people around them throughout the movie, all to maintain the upper hand. They have much in common, which leads to a torrid, hot love affair. As the stakes grow and the body count gets higher, the final conclusion leaves you scratching your head and questioning ""who exactly is the killer""? To this day, my friends and I still debate as to who the real killer is. In Paul Verhoeven's commentary, he says very plainly who the killer, but it is still fun to play ""what ifs"".The DVD has some great special features. Two commentaries, test reels, storyboards, deleted scenes, but the fake ""ice pick"" pen that comes with the DVD should be enough for any real fan to want to buy this film.",4,A fun manipulative sexy thriller...,1014163200,"02 20, 2002",2002,1616,"['never', 'tire', 'film', 'Seen', 'number', 'times', 'excellent', 'story', 'very', 'fun', 'characters.Michael', 'Douglas', 'perfect', 'dark', 'recovering', 'drug', 'alcoholic', 'edgy', 'cop', 'Nick', 'Curran', 'who', 'wrong', 'person', 'Nick', 'continualy', 'trouble', 'internal', 'affairs', 'very', 'bad', 'habit', 'shooting', 'weapon', 'killing', 'people', 'job', 'nicknamed', 'strong', 'affection', 'Shooter', '.Sharon', 'Stone', 'film', 'career', 'flew', 'release', 'Basic', 'Instinct', 'What', 'great', 'role', 'playing', 'sexy', 'manipulative', 'dominant', 'intelligent', 'seductive', 'Catherine', 'Tramell', 'Director', 'Paul', 'Verhoeven', 'devil', 'might', 'be', 'eyes', 'are', 'amazing', 'never', 'quite', 'know', 'what', 'exactly', 'thinking.Douglas', 'charge', 'finding', 'killer', 'aging', 'rock', 'star', 'search', 'Stone', 'cat', 'mouse', 'game', 'Douglas', 'Stone', 'characters', 'lie', 'cheat', 'manipulate', 'people', 'movie', 'maintain', 'upper', 'hand', 'have', 'much', 'common', 'torrid', 'hot', 'love', 'affair', 'stakes', 'grow', 'body', 'count', 'higher', 'final', 'conclusion', 'scratching', 'head', 'questioning', 'who', 'exactly', 'killer', 'day', 'friends', 'still', 'debate', 'who', 'real', 'killer', 'Paul', 'Verhoeven', 'commentary', 'very', 'plainly', 'who', 'killer', 'still', 'fun', 'play', 'what', 'ifs', '.The', 'DVD', 'great', 'special', 'features', 'Two', 'commentaries', 'test', 'reels', 'storyboards', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'fake', 'ice', 'pick', 'pen', 'DVD', 'should', 'be', 'enough', 'real', 'fan', 'want', 'buy', 'film']",N/A

I wasn't disappointed; this is a terrifically goofy, fun piece of work, that serves as marvelous entertainment if you don't take it too seriously. Sharon Stone is solid (in the one of the few roles I've seen her do where she actually acted), and Michael Douglas is surprisingly good, playing a nastier variation on all of his ""middle-aged-white-male-who-sleeps-with-younger-women"" roles.
