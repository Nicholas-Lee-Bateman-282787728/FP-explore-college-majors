I loved everything about it, the characters, the actors, the writing and the situations.  Thankfully, watching this DVD I experienced the same joy and entertainment I did upon my firt viewings all those years ago.Sure the show is dated but the comedy and situations are universal and timeless.  If you're a sit-com fan who's never seen Kate & Allie before, you're in for a big treat.This single DVD has all six episodes of the show's first season plus one episode from season 2.  You also get a short documentary featuring Susan Sait James and the show's creator talking about making the show.  Also included on the disc is a very fun half hour or so documentary about other shows that were on the 1980's.  It was a real nostalgia trip to see all these old shows.  I'm sure to watch this almost as much as the shows themselves.  A cute bloopers reel is also on the disc.Overall this is a great start to enjoying Kate & Allie on DVD.  Only trouble is that this single DVD is priced too high.

972271,A1JKFUUCZRA3Z4,B000EGDAO8,Elisabeth,"[4, 4]","I consider Jane Curtain one of the funniest actresses of all time.  From her early work on ""Saturday Night Live"", to her later work on ""Third Rock from the Sun"", to ""Kate and Allie"" in between, Jane Curtain can do no wrong in my eyes.On ""Kate and Allie"", she plays Allie, while Susan Saint James plays Kate.  Together, they play a couple of best friends who live together post-divorce and raise their kids together.  Although these two are best friends, they're very different in temperament and aspirations.  Each episode reveals their differences.In episode 1, Allie goes on her first date post-divorce.  Here we learn these women's differences in self-esteem.  Kate is a very confident woman in both her beauty and sexuality, while Allie is more timid and unsure of herself.  Here we also discover Allie's competitiveness with Kate, which will come up later in the season, too.In episode 2, Kate's daughter makes a school video of the family interacting with one another as a way to show how divorce impacts families.  Here we discover the two women's differing parenting styles.  Allie pushes her kids towards achieving excellence, while Kate is more laid back and content with her daughter being a C-student.  However, in this episode, Allie influences Kate to push a little harder and expect a little more from her daughter.  We also learn what kind of father Kate's ex-husband is.In episode 3, Allie's son gets beat up by a bully.  Here we discover more about the differences in parenting style, plus how having a split family impacts the children.  In episode 2, we learned what kind of father Kate's ex-husband was, and in episode 3, we learn what kind of father Allie's ex-husband is.In episode 4, Allie starts her own home-based cake making business.  Here we discover these women's differences in career aspirations.  Kate is career-minded and wants to climb the latter, while Allie has always believed a women's place is to stay home and be taken care of by a man.  However, Kate influences Allie to push herself out of her comfort zone.In episode 5, Allie starts to add more of her stuff (actually a lot of her stuff) into Kate's home, whom her and her kids have moved into.  Here we learn their differences in style plus how challenging it is to move two different tastes into one living space.In episode 6, Kate spends a weekend alone with her ex-husband while Allie is left home alone for the first time in her life.  Here we discover their differences in being independent and we also learn more about Kate's marriage to her ex.Both of these women are funny, but it's really Curtain who gave me the most laughs, and there were some laugh out loud moments in this series.  Although this show is commentary on divorce, because it's a comedy, things are kept pretty light and always a happy ending.  This show aired during the 80's and it's evident by Kate's bright clothing.  What's funny, though, is that some things Kate wears are back in style today!Overall, I enjoy this show because it's funny and fun to watch.",5,"Just when you think you're all by yourself, you're not",1275782400,"06 6, 2010",2010,3032,"['consider', 'Jane', 'Curtain', 'one', 'funniest', 'actresses', 'time', 'early', 'work', 'Saturday', 'Night', 'Live', 'later', 'work', 'Third', 'Rock', 'Sun', 'Kate', 'Allie', 'Jane', 'Curtain', 'can', 'do', 'wrong', 'eyes.On', 'Kate', 'Allie', 'Allie', 'Susan', 'Saint', 'James', 'Kate', 'Together', 'play', 'couple', 'best', 'friends', 'who', 'live', 'together', 'post-divorce', 'raise', 'kids', 'together', 'two', 'are', 'best', 'friends', ""'re"", 'very', 'different', 'temperament', 'aspirations', 'episode', 'differences.In', 'episode', '1', 'Allie', 'first', 'date', 'post-divorce', 'Here', 'learn', 'women', 'differences', 'self-esteem', 'Kate', 'very', 'confident', 'woman', 'beauty', 'sexuality', 'Allie', 'more', 'timid', 'unsure', 'herself', 'Here', 'also', 'discover', 'Allie', 'competitiveness', 'Kate', 'will', 'come', 'up', 'later', 'season', 'too.In', 'episode', '2', 'Kate', 'daughter', 'school', 'video', 'family', 'interacting', 'one', 'way', 'show', 'how', 'divorce', 'impacts', 'families', 'Here', 'discover', 'two', 'women', 'differing', 'parenting', 'styles', 'Allie', 'kids', 'achieving', 'excellence', 'Kate', 'more', 'laid', 'back', 'content', 'daughter', 'being', 'C-student', 'However', 'episode', 'Allie', 'Kate', 'push', 'little', 'harder', 'expect', 'little', 'more', 'daughter', 'also', 'learn', 'what', 'kind', 'father', 'Kate', 'ex-husband', 'is.In', 'episode', '3', 'Allie', 'son', 'beat', 'up', 'bully', 'Here', 'discover', 'more', 'differences', 'parenting', 'style', 'how', 'having', 'split', 'family', 'children', 'episode', '2', 'learned', 'what', 'kind', 'father', 'Kate', 'ex-husband', 'was', 'episode', '3', 'learn', 'what', 'kind', 'father', 'Allie', 'ex-husband', 'is.In', 'episode', '4', 'Allie', 'own', 'home-based', 'cake', 'making', 'business', 'Here', 'discover', 'women', 'differences', 'career', 'aspirations', 'Kate', 'career-minded', 'climb', 'latter', 'Allie', 'always', 'believed', 'women', 'place', 'stay', 'home', 'be', 'taken', 'care', 'man', 'However', 'Kate', 'Allie', 'push', 'comfort', 'zone.In', 'episode', '5', 'Allie', 'add', 'more', 'stuff', 'actually', 'lot', 'stuff', 'Kate', 'home', 'whom', 'kids', 'have', 'moved', 'Here', 'learn', 'differences', 'style', 'how', 'challenging', 'move', 'two', 'different', 'tastes', 'one', 'living', 'space.In', 'episode', '6', 'Kate', 'weekend', 'alone', 'ex-husband', 'Allie', 'left', 'home', 'alone', 'first', 'time', 'life', 'Here', 'discover', 'differences', 'being', 'independent', 'also', 'learn', 'more', 'Kate', 'marriage', 'ex.Both', 'women', 'are', 'funny', 'really', 'Curtain', 'who', 'gave', 'most', 'laughs', 'were', 'laugh', 'loud', 'moments', 'series', 'show', 'commentary', 'divorce', 'comedy', 'things', 'are', 'kept', 'pretty', 'light', 'always', 'happy', 'ending', 'show', 'aired', '80', 'evident', 'Kate', 'bright', 'clothing', 'What', 'funny', 'though', 'things', 'Kate', 'wears', 'are', 'back', 'style', 'today', 'Overall', 'enjoy', 'show', 'funny', 'fun', 'watch']",N/A

This was the first great women dominated series since Mary Tyler Moore in the 1970's.Kate and Ally were two divocees that are sharing an apartment in NYC.  They could not make ends meet on their own and also could use each other for moral support.Kate McCardle(Susan St. James) was married to an actor and has a daugter, Emma (Ari Meyers).  Therefore, she always supported her family.Allie Lowell (Jane Curtin - just after SNL) was married to a doctor who dumped her for a newer model.  She has two kids Jennie (Allison Smith - a former Broadway Little Orpan Annie)and Chip (Frederick Koehler).Each episode dealt with the girls dealing with making ends meet or a child's crisis.  This was one of the best written series of the 80's.This also proved that Jane Curtin had more to her than Saturday Night Live skits.  This also was Susan St. James' first hit since MacMillan and Wife.I call this a woman's series but it is not for women.  Eveyone will enjoy the wity dialog and the true to life situations that the show dealt with.THIS IS A DEFINITE MUST HAVE SERIES!!NOTE: I just discovered that this has just six episodes.  And they are the syndicated version.  The thing is that at the end of each show there was a great scene usually between the two stars.  This was a great cap to the episode but in the syndicated version, this was cut out because it was an addition to the show and the show could stand alone but it was that great piece of extra that made the series special.",5,Jane and Jill create two Great Ladies,1142985600,"03 22, 2006",2006,1537,"['Kate', 'Allie', 'was', 'great', 'woman', 'comedy', '80', 'was', 'first', 'great', 'women', 'dominated', 'series', 'Mary', 'Tyler', 'Moore', ""1970's.Kate"", 'Ally', 'were', 'two', 'divocees', 'are', 'sharing', 'apartment', 'NYC', 'could', 'not', 'make', 'ends', 'meet', 'own', 'also', 'could', 'use', 'other', 'moral', 'support.Kate', 'McCardle', 'Susan', 'St.', 'James', 'was', 'married', 'actor', 'daugter', 'Emma', 'Ari', 'Meyers', 'Therefore', 'always', 'supported', 'family.Allie', 'Lowell', 'Jane', 'Curtin', 'just', 'SNL', 'was', 'married', 'doctor', 'who', 'dumped', 'newer', 'model', 'two', 'kids', 'Jennie', 'Allison', 'Smith', 'former', 'Broadway', 'Little', 'Orpan', 'Annie', 'Chip', 'Frederick', 'Koehler', '.Each', 'episode', 'dealt', 'girls', 'dealing', 'making', 'ends', 'meet', 'child', 'crisis', 'was', 'one', 'best', 'written', 'series', ""80's.This"", 'also', 'proved', 'Jane', 'Curtin', 'had', 'more', 'Saturday', 'Night', 'Live', 'skits', 'also', 'was', 'Susan', 'St.', 'James', 'first', 'hit', 'MacMillan', 'Wife.I', 'call', 'woman', 'series', 'not', 'women', 'Eveyone', 'will', 'enjoy', 'wity', 'dialog', 'true', 'life', 'situations', 'show', 'with.THIS', 'DEFINITE', 'MUST', 'HAVE', 'SERIES', 'NOTE', 'just', 'discovered', 'just', 'six', 'episodes', 'are', 'syndicated', 'version', 'thing', 'end', 'show', 'there', 'was', 'great', 'scene', 'usually', 'two', 'stars', 'was', 'great', 'cap', 'episode', 'syndicated', 'version', 'was', 'cut', 'out', 'was', 'addition', 'show', 'show', 'could', 'stand', 'alone', 'was', 'great', 'piece', 'extra', 'made', 'series', 'special']",N/A

The shoulder pads, clunky answering machine, and hairdon'ts give away the decade, but the storylines of grown-up best friends supporting and, at times, sparring with each other during personal and professional crises are timeless.Curtain and Saint James share a wonderful chemistry that makes them easy to watch.

972289,A4UKBG3M5U5TI,B000EGDAO8,Westley,"[2, 3]","""Kate & Allie"" debuted as a mid-season replacement in spring 1984.  The show's first six episodes, which comprise this first season disk, were an immediate hit (#8 for the season and an Emmy nomination for Best Comedy Series), and the series continued for another five seasons.  The series repaired Susan St. James (""McMillan and Wife"") as Kate and Jane Curtin (""Saturday Night Live"") as Allie - the two had starred in the largely forgotten 1980 movie, ""How to Beat the High Co$t of Living"" (which also featured Jessica Lange).  Kate and Allie are both mothers who have been best friends since childhood.  Kate has been divorced for awhile, and when Allie's successful physician husband divorces her, she and Kate decide to move in together and start a new life.  Kate works at a travel agency, while life-long housewife Allie stays home and takes care of the house and kids.I watched ""Kate & Allie"" regularly as a teen when it was on the air.  Since then, it has rarely been in syndication, especially when compared to other hit comedies of the era.  Frankly, time hasn't been particularly kind to the show.  The first six episodes contain a few laughs, but the show is clearly still trying to find its footing.  The acting is so-so, with Susan St. James coming off best as free-spirited Kate.  Jane Curtin (who won two consecutive Emmys for Lead Actress in a Comedy, beating St. James in the process) seems shrill today, and her character is simply not endearing.  Likewise, Kate's daughter (Emma played by Ari Meyers) comes off much more naturally than Allie's two kids (Allison Smith as Jennie and Frederick Koehler as Chip), who mug for the camera and step on every line.  However, the series still is worthwhile for its warm depiction of adult female friends who pitch in to help each other.  Most people can only dream of having a friend like Kate or Allie.  I would have given it 4 stars, but this DVD set has become outdated by the subsequent release of a set featuring both Seasons 1 and 2.  The set really isn't worth buying for six skimpy shows.",3,"""Just when you think you're all by yourself, you're not.""",1228953600,"12 11, 2008",2008,2057,"['Kate', 'Allie', 'debuted', 'mid-season', 'replacement', 'spring', '1984', 'show', 'first', 'six', 'episodes', 'comprise', 'first', 'season', 'disk', 'were', 'immediate', 'hit', '8', 'season', 'Emmy', 'nomination', 'Best', 'Comedy', 'Series', 'series', 'continued', 'five', 'seasons', 'series', 'repaired', 'Susan', 'St.', 'James', 'McMillan', 'Wife', 'Kate', 'Jane', 'Curtin', 'Saturday', 'Night', 'Live', 'Allie', 'two', 'had', 'starred', 'largely', 'forgotten', '1980', 'movie', 'How', 'Beat', 'High', 'Co', 't', 'Living', 'also', 'featured', 'Jessica', 'Lange', 'Kate', 'Allie', 'are', 'mothers', 'who', 'have', 'been', 'best', 'friends', 'childhood', 'Kate', 'been', 'divorced', 'awhile', 'when', 'Allie', 'successful', 'physician', 'husband', 'Kate', 'decide', 'move', 'together', 'start', 'new', 'life', 'Kate', 'travel', 'agency', 'life-long', 'housewife', 'Allie', 'home', 'care', 'house', 'kids.I', 'watched', 'Kate', 'Allie', 'regularly', 'teen', 'when', 'was', 'air', 'then', 'rarely', 'been', 'syndication', 'especially', 'when', 'compared', 'other', 'hit', 'comedies', 'era', 'Frankly', 'time', ""n't"", 'been', 'particularly', 'kind', 'show', 'first', 'six', 'episodes', 'contain', 'few', 'laughs', 'show', 'clearly', 'still', 'trying', 'find', 'footing', 'acting', 'so-so', 'Susan', 'St.', 'James', 'coming', 'off', 'best', 'free-spirited', 'Kate', 'Jane', 'Curtin', 'who', 'won', 'two', 'consecutive', 'Emmys', 'Lead', 'Actress', 'Comedy', 'beating', 'St.', 'James', 'process', 'shrill', 'today', 'character', 'simply', 'not', 'endearing', 'Likewise', 'Kate', 'daughter', 'Emma', 'played', 'Ari', 'Meyers', 'off', 'much', 'more', 'naturally', 'Allie', 'two', 'kids', 'Allison', 'Smith', 'Jennie', 'Frederick', 'Koehler', 'Chip', 'who', 'mug', 'camera', 'step', 'line', 'However', 'series', 'still', 'worthwhile', 'warm', 'depiction', 'adult', 'female', 'friends', 'who', 'pitch', 'help', 'other', 'Most', 'people', 'can', 'only', 'dream', 'having', 'friend', 'Kate', 'Allie', 'would', 'have', 'given', '4', 'stars', 'DVD', 'set', 'become', 'outdated', 'subsequent', 'release', 'set', 'featuring', 'Seasons', '1', '2', 'set', 'really', ""n't"", 'worth', 'buying', 'six', 'skimpy', 'shows']",N/A
