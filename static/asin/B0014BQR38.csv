And each individual characters contribution make for a Magnificent Seven.  There's Chris (Michael Biehn), the tortured soul who lost his wife and young son in a fire, ladies man Buck (Dale Midkiff), Vin(Eric Close) ex buffalo and bounty hunter then there is sometimes preacherman and always missionary son Josiah (Ron Perlman), gambler, son of a grifter/con-artist, Ezra (Anthony Starke), former slave and wanna-be doctor Nathan (Rick Worthy) and the youngest of them all J D. Dunn (Andrew Kavovit).  And the other supporting cast of Laurie Holden as Mary Travis, owner of the local newspaper and widowed mother whose son lives with his Grandfather, territorial Judge played by Robert Vaughn and Grandmother (that we never meet).  And Ezra's grifter/con-artist Mother played by Michelle Phillips.As I said, I watch these shows over and over, It's not all shoot 'em up, but of course it is a western, but not a lot of blood and the fights are over quick. It's just a good, clean fun western series that should have lasted longer that it did.  My guess as to why it didn't last was not due to bad acting or story lines (all are good), it's that people have just lost interest in history and especially history of the west.

Which makes me wonder why we haven't seen more of this guy in major stuff.He's a wonderful actor & he's good looking. So why is Hollywood forcing such morons upon us as leading men when there's guys like this out there?I'm a little jaded about westerns bcs we live on a ranch & whenever I watch one, my husband & I are always looking at the horses, tack, & the way the actors ride. The tack seems somewhat historically accurate. There were some pretty old saddles to see.None of those actors could ride. Maybe they learned to ride in the 2nd season, who knows.The show is way too idealistic & there just weren't that many senseless murders in the 'old west'.But I expect that for a TV show & I suppose it's no big deal.I must say that Perlman is playing such a creepy wierd guy he almost makes me cringe.Bien looks so frigging silly in that outfit he's always wearing I can't help but bust out laughing during the credits when they show him trying to look all macho-which only makes him look more rediculous.This J.D. kid is an unbelieveable idiot.Buck is no ladies man that would ever attract me-ICK.Vin Tanner is OK-his acting is almost as good as Starke's.The Dr. guy is OK-but nothing to write home about.Overall-the only saving grace for this show is the character Ezra Standish.",3,Iffy,1260403200,"12 10, 2009",2009,1600,"['Well', 'other', 'fact', 'Perlman', 'stirrups', 'rigged', 'little', 'fat', 'kid', 'find', 'show', 'mediocre', 'best.The', 'only', 'reason', ""'m"", 'going', 'buy', 'season', '2', 'bcs', 'Starke', 'character', 'Ezra.Out', 'whole', 'show', 'man', 'most', 'believable', 'portrayal', 'character.I', 'think', 'excellent', 'job', 'Which', 'wonder', 'why', 'have', ""n't"", 'seen', 'more', 'guy', 'major', 'stuff.He', 'wonderful', 'actor', 'good', 'looking', 'So', 'why', 'Hollywood', 'forcing', 'such', 'morons', 'upon', 'leading', 'men', 'when', 'guys', 'there', ""'m"", 'little', 'jaded', 'westerns', 'live', 'ranch', 'whenever', 'watch', 'one', 'husband', 'are', 'always', 'looking', 'horses', 'tack', 'way', 'actors', 'ride', 'tack', 'somewhat', 'historically', 'accurate', 'were', 'pretty', 'old', 'saddles', 'see.None', 'actors', 'could', 'ride', 'Maybe', 'learned', 'ride', '2nd', 'season', 'who', 'knows.The', 'show', 'way', 'too', 'idealistic', 'just', 'were', ""n't"", 'that', 'many', 'senseless', 'murders', ""'old"", ""west'.But"", 'expect', 'TV', 'show', 'suppose', 'big', 'deal.I', 'must', 'say', 'Perlman', 'playing', 'such', 'creepy', 'wierd', 'guy', 'almost', 'cringe.Bien', 'looks', 'so', 'frigging', 'silly', 'outfit', 'always', 'wearing', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'bust', 'out', 'laughing', 'credits', 'when', 'show', 'trying', 'look', 'macho-which', 'only', 'look', 'more', 'rediculous.This', 'J.D', 'kid', 'unbelieveable', 'idiot.Buck', 'ladies', 'man', 'would', 'ever', 'attract', 'me-ICK.Vin', 'Tanner', 'OK-his', 'acting', 'almost', 'as', 'good', ""Starke's.The"", 'Dr.', 'guy', 'OK-but', 'nothing', 'write', 'home', 'about.Overall-the', 'only', 'saving', 'grace', 'show', 'character', 'Ezra', 'Standish']",Magnificent Seven Complete Series Gift Set
