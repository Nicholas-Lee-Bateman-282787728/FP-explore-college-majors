The artwork is better and the dubbing isn't bad and there are several commentarries.If this is your first serious anime series what im about to say may seem strange but this version is a bit less violent than the original! I wasn't all that happy about that but there's still more than enough blood and beat-downs to satisfy our basic needs for violence.It's a good series and worth buying but you may want to check it out for yourself before you put it under the Christmas tree for your little ones.,4,Version 2.0,1292457600,"12 16, 2010",2010,563,"['second', 'version', 'anime', 'pretty', 'good', 'artwork', 'better', 'dubbing', ""n't"", 'bad', 'are', 'several', 'commentarries.If', 'first', 'serious', 'anime', 'series', 'what', 'say', 'may', 'seem', 'strange', 'version', 'bit', 'less', 'violent', 'original', 'was', ""n't"", 'happy', 'still', 'more', 'enough', 'blood', 'beat-downs', 'satisfy', 'basic', 'needs', 'violence.It', 'good', 'series', 'worth', 'buying', 'may', 'want', 'check', 'out', 'put', 'Christmas', 'tree', 'little', 'ones']",Guyver -The Bioboosted Armor: Complete

1187715,A2GPRA9HHLOC4B,B001F2U6X8,Eric L. Willard,"[2, 9]","I am a fan of the original Guyver. I don't normally buy dvd's of anime that take 26 episodes to tell a story. This was a looong, drawn out, story that could have been told in much fewer episodes. I found myself walking away from the tv 1/2 way through the dvd's just because I was getting so bored with them introducing yet another monster, an evolved version of the same monster, and then the looong drawn out, missing time that Sho (Guyver) is ""evolving"" into a very effeminate version of the Guyver unit. (Spoiler) As the original Guyver, he had a cool, ""guy"" look but he evolves into a version that is way girly or effeminate which was a real step down in my opinion.The animation is right up there with the original Guyver and current anime but the long, drawn out story and aweful evolution of the Guyver made me have to drop my review.This is only for the true anime fans that enjoy the trend of making guys out to be girly looking and trying to still make them cool. The new Guyver is not the same Guyver you knew from the original. It is a step (or leap) down. He was cool the way he was. Look for previews before buying.EDIT:I showed this to a friend that is a huge anime fan and he said the same thing.

The anime is a different story. I was totally rocked by this series. There are tons of cool fight scenes. Lots of good villains and heroes. The voice acting is good and the animation is also pretty good. There is really good character development and some emotional scenes. This series also has lots of action to keep you interested.I can't think of anything bad to say about Guyver. It's one you can watch several times and not get bored.

The one other thing I enjoyed for myself is that the bloody and gory battle scenes are still in the show.  So for anyone who has young kids who feels that any bloody scenes or grotesque killing shots  isn't appropriate for their kids might want to stay away from this show.  If you've seen the OVA episodes or read some of the manga it keeps pretty much with those story lines for the most part, also unlike the OVA episodes which tried to cram so much of the story plot into just twelve episodes that a lot of questions got unanswered the new series answers most of them.
