901625,ADBEG8PLO3OMC,B00094ASC2,"A. Johnson ""Jason Hex""","[0, 0]","If Prozac Nation's sensibility feels a bit sketchy at times, it may be because it divides our sympathies. It's hard to feel much compassion for Elizabeth Wurtzel, this beautiful, talented, overachieving Harvard scholar who wins a coveted college journalism award and a chance to write for Rolling Stone magazine before she's out of her teens. Her dramas feel like the tangled, self-involved chaos of adolescence, curled up in a ball surrounded by the debris of indulgence. Why should we care?In fact, it's precisely this messy picture that the disease of depression creates, and the filmmakers show greater-than-average sensitivity in adapting Wurtzel's memoir. This is what depression looks like: Reckless glamor on the outside, a gaping hole on the inside. Wurtzel's friends and lovers drop off one by one in the harrowing wake of her disease; only her mother, played with great power by Jessica Lange, hangs on, in love and desperation. Christina Ricci is perfect casting for Wurtzel, because despite the fact that she looks scrumptious with a champagne glass, her eyes have the same scary eat-you-alive quality that cast her perfectly as Wednesday Addams when she was much younger.What I love about this movie is that it doesn't try to whitewash the paradoxes of depression, the hurtful acting-out, the monstrous folly of it, the bad choices made solely in order to feel something different than either numbness or raw psychic pain. If you hate the depression, you don't necessarily have to love the depressive; Wurtzel has to earn our trust again and again, and the Prozac of the title doesn't transform her automatically into a better person. The movie does a bit of semi-tidy resolution by the end titles, but the heroine remains an ambivalent figure. Which is as it should be--she's finally able to face herself without tumbling automatically into the void. This is required viewing for anybody who loves someone with depression.",5,"Unsentimental, Devastatingly Accurate Portrait of Depression",1201737600,"01 31, 2008",2008,1937,"['Prozac', 'Nation', 'sensibility', 'bit', 'sketchy', 'times', 'may', 'be', 'sympathies', 'hard', 'feel', 'much', 'compassion', 'Elizabeth', 'Wurtzel', 'beautiful', 'talented', 'overachieving', 'Harvard', 'scholar', 'who', 'coveted', 'college', 'journalism', 'award', 'chance', 'write', 'Rolling', 'Stone', 'magazine', 'teens', 'dramas', 'feel', 'tangled', 'self-involved', 'chaos', 'adolescence', 'curled', 'up', 'ball', 'surrounded', 'debris', 'indulgence', 'Why', 'should', 'care', 'fact', 'precisely', 'messy', 'picture', 'disease', 'depression', 'creates', 'filmmakers', 'show', 'greater-than-average', 'sensitivity', 'adapting', 'Wurtzel', 'memoir', 'what', 'depression', 'Reckless', 'glamor', 'outside', 'gaping', 'hole', 'inside', 'Wurtzel', 'friends', 'lovers', 'drop', 'off', 'one', 'one', 'harrowing', 'wake', 'disease', 'only', 'mother', 'played', 'great', 'power', 'Jessica', 'Lange', 'hangs', 'love', 'desperation', 'Christina', 'Ricci', 'perfect', 'casting', 'Wurtzel', 'fact', 'scrumptious', 'champagne', 'glass', 'eyes', 'have', 'same', 'scary', 'eat-you-alive', 'quality', 'cast', 'perfectly', 'Wednesday', 'Addams', 'when', 'was', 'much', 'love', 'movie', ""n't"", 'try', 'whitewash', 'paradoxes', 'depression', 'hurtful', 'acting-out', 'monstrous', 'folly', 'bad', 'choices', 'made', 'solely', 'order', 'feel', 'something', 'different', 'numbness', 'raw', 'psychic', 'pain', 'hate', 'depression', 'do', ""n't"", 'necessarily', 'have', 'love', 'depressive', 'Wurtzel', 'earn', 'trust', 'again', 'again', 'Prozac', 'title', ""n't"", 'transform', 'automatically', 'better', 'person', 'movie', 'bit', 'semi-tidy', 'resolution', 'end', 'titles', 'heroine', 'ambivalent', 'figure', 'Which', 'should', 'be', 'finally', 'able', 'face', 'tumbling', 'automatically', 'void', 'required', 'viewing', 'anybody', 'who', 'someone', 'depression']",Prozac Nation

901627,A1R602SXNGOMJ4,B00094ASC2,A. Vegan,"[9, 10]","I thought that the main problem with Prozac Nation was that it just seemed to lack focus. The movie obviously compressed a lot of details in the book, but I think if it had just focused on the main crisis of the book, the character's descent into depression would have been easier to understand and empathize. As it was, it tried to do that, but it also tried to cram in other things, and I feel that if I hadn't read the book or gone through something similar myself, I would not have understood why Lizzie was so afflicted at this particular point in her life.I thought the acting was excellent: Michelle Williams and Jason Biggs were great, and Christina Ricci was phenomenal, capturing the entire range of the pain and anger and self-loathing of depression. I thought Jessica Lange put in a good performance, although her bizarre accent and the fact that she in no way resembles the darker and petite Christina Ricci was really distracting. I was simply unable to believe she was her mother, and certainly not a Jewish mother.If you've suffered from severe depression, then watch it and know that there are other people who feel the same way you do and think the same thoughts as you, and who would understand why you feel and act the way you do. Otherwise, skip it. If you don't understand depression before going into the film, it is unlikely that this it will shed any light on the topic for you. It's pretty much impossible to understand unless you've been there yourself.",3,The book is always better,1160352000,"10 9, 2006",2006,1480,"['thought', 'main', 'problem', 'Prozac', 'Nation', 'was', 'just', 'seemed', 'lack', 'focus', 'movie', 'obviously', 'compressed', 'lot', 'details', 'book', 'think', 'had', 'just', 'focused', 'main', 'crisis', 'book', 'character', 'descent', 'depression', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'easier', 'understand', 'empathize', 'was', 'tried', 'do', 'also', 'tried', 'cram', 'other', 'things', 'feel', 'had', ""n't"", 'read', 'book', 'gone', 'something', 'similar', 'would', 'not', 'have', 'understood', 'why', 'Lizzie', 'was', 'so', 'afflicted', 'particular', 'point', 'life.I', 'thought', 'acting', 'was', 'excellent', 'Michelle', 'Williams', 'Jason', 'Biggs', 'were', 'great', 'Christina', 'Ricci', 'was', 'phenomenal', 'capturing', 'entire', 'range', 'pain', 'anger', 'self-loathing', 'depression', 'thought', 'Jessica', 'Lange', 'put', 'good', 'performance', 'bizarre', 'accent', 'fact', 'way', 'darker', 'petite', 'Christina', 'Ricci', 'was', 'really', 'distracting', 'was', 'simply', 'unable', 'believe', 'was', 'mother', 'certainly', 'not', 'Jewish', 'mother.If', ""'ve"", 'suffered', 'severe', 'depression', 'then', 'watch', 'know', 'are', 'other', 'people', 'who', 'feel', 'same', 'way', 'do', 'think', 'same', 'thoughts', 'who', 'would', 'understand', 'why', 'feel', 'act', 'way', 'do', 'Otherwise', 'skip', 'do', ""n't"", 'understand', 'depression', 'going', 'film', 'unlikely', 'will', 'shed', 'light', 'topic', 'pretty', 'much', 'impossible', 'understand', ""'ve"", 'been']",Prozac Nation
901628,A2582KMXLK2P06,B00094ASC2,B. E Jackson,"[0, 0]","Prozac Nation is about a college girl who seems to have everything going for her.  A promising future as a writer, the opportunity to meet big name rock stars such as Lou Reed, immediate friendships with her roommates and other students, a boyfriend who cares deeply about her, and the chance to write for major rock publications such as Rolling Stone magazine.What can disrupt such a bright future?  Depression, drugs, and frequent suicide attempts to name just a few things... and my goodness do they ever ruin this young girls life.  She's now a *monster*.  With these personal demons taking over, she's now unstable, unfriendly, unprofessional, and psychotic too.  She's a different person.  None of the people in her life -such as her friends and especially her mother- can get through to her, or even understand the magnitude of the problems that have basically given her a one way ticket to the mental institution.Christina's character nails a really wonderful performance by being believable in her role.  She shows what it really is like being someone who's battling severe anger issues, drug addiction, depression and suicide.  At first she chalks it up to being stressed out but we soon realize the problem spirals much deeper than that.  Christina Ricci's character is flat out insane.  Whenever she blurts out something unusual and exceptionally mean, it always hurts the people that are only trying to reach out and help her.  It's amazing how much support she tries to receive but rejects time and time again.  The average person wouldn't be willing to help this much, in fact, especially since her roommates don't even know her very well.The acting is amazingly good.  This is NO ordinary college flick involving parties, drugs and alcohol.  This is all about Christina's personal issues coming to light and destroying not only the joyous times she was in the process of having with her roommates, but mainly the relationship with her mother and father.  The mother is another really extraordinary character- feeling powerless, sad and embarrassed for her daughter.  The segment with the grandparents is most startling.It's really a moving film.  Clearly Christina Ricci was the right person for this role.  Great job picking out just the right person by all the directors and writers of the movie.

It wasn't horrible to watch but after one viewing I had no desire to watch it again anytime in the future. I feel Ricci did what she could for the role but the story is lacking.

901630,AZQP4EIUUNEWD,B00094ASC2,BlueVistaGT,"[0, 0]","Was just browsing through Amazon's Instant Videos one night when I stumbled across this one.  I've always been a Christina Ricci fan, but never really heard of this movie.  I was drawn to the title and of course the cover.  As I read through other people's reviews just to gain a sense of the subject matter, I couldn't help but purchase and watch this movie on the spot.First, I have to say that there was no doubt in my mind that Christina Ricci would provide a stellar performance.  The opening scene of the movie was an eye opener as she sits totally nude on her bed for reasons unknown - who does that?  Anyway, as much I appreciated seeing her looking absolutely amazing in all scenes, I felt like she was telling me her story and couldn't help but wonder what else she had in store for me as the movie progressed.  I began to appreciate the character and her struggles, and found myself feeling empathy, sympathy, hatred, love, for her.  I wanted to console her during her big crying scene when she discovers that her mother was paying all of her medical bills and not her father.  I wanted to smack her around when she pushed all the people who supported her away.  The author does a fantastic job of telling the story and revealing how utterly dysfunctional her parents are.  Her Dad needed a good A$$ whooping..This movie is such an emotional roller coaster that I felt exhausted by the end - but in a good way.  I have a teenage child who has many of the same symptoms and wanted to watch this movie to hopefully help me better understand her perspective.  I am also a child of divorce, my parents rarely hugged me, my Mom cheated on my Dad - my Dad cheated on my Mom; my Dad was an alcoholic and would take me with him when he went bowling weekly and then later left me in the car at night all alone while he visited bars to continue his drunken stupor - I was only 10 years old at the time.  But in spite of my screwed up childhood, I still turned out fine with a relatively happy family with wife and three children, three cars, three cats, six figure income and two houses and still happily married for almost 22 years.I just wish I could understand how someone like my daughter, with everything handed to her, with lots of family support and love, can still have such a disorder and I pray that she never considers some of the things that this character/person did.  By the way, my daughter also has aspirations of some day becoming a successful author.

901637,A3SFO2GSP5CVSM,B00094ASC2,"Cosmoetica ""cosmoeticadotcom""","[5, 25]","In the real world of art Elizabeth Wurtzel is the sexy drama queen every guy wants to do, but no guy wants to wake up next to. Her on-screen portrayer, Christina Ricci, is the ugly artsy wannabe girl that desperately wants every and any guy, but no guy will touch her. That's why, in Prozac Nation, the unreleased 2001 film of Wurtzel's 1990s bestseller book of the same name, there are immediate problems. Ok, the problems start before the miscast of Ricci, who has the emotional range of a thimble- is it any wonder that, by far, her finest acting was in the two Addams Family films? First off, she is bizarre looking- with big eyes and a bulging forehead, making her look like the fetal Starchild from 2001: A Space Odyssey. Secondly, she always plays whiney brats. But, thirdly, is the way films try to make it appear any guy would be attracted to her. In one scene in the film her pal Ruby (Michelle Williams) and Liz walk through Harvard, and all the guys' tongues are wagging at Ricci, not the super-cute and sexy Williams. Hello....Reality check time.... This material begged for the Andy Warhol treatment. Here is his version of the film. A five minute shot of a hypodermic needle. A five minute shot of Wurtzel's hairy pudenda. A five minute shot of her sleeping naked and stoned on the bed. She rises, gives the middle finger to the audience. Cue credits. See, less than twenty minutes to distill Wurtzel's whole life. And, oh yeah, Warhol's film would not have cast Ricci. Even Michelle Williams would have been better, and after seeing Ricci's pallid bosom, I'd take anything Williams or any other babe had to offer me cinematically.

901655,AQ2RL6HTVI86T,B00094ASC2,"J. Bridell ""Lost Johnny""","[11, 16]","This is a film about two things, clinical depression and Christina Ricci.  When Tim Burton thought of the ""Joker"" in the first Batman movie, there was only one real choice, Jack Nicholson had to play the part he was born for, it was a no brainier and he ruled.  No one could have been better cast then Christina Ricci in the role she was clearly destined for, she will never be better, there will never again be a roll more suited to everyone's favorite crazy girl, she as good as it gets.  Monster, Buffalo 66, Anything Else, The Opposite of Sex those are her crowning achievements, and she is only 25, a person might be jealous of Ms. Ricci, of her success, but who among us would want to be her? to be in such a state that these tortured souls are so seemingly easy for her to play....not play so much as become?  This is a deeply personal film based on, I believe, a very personal novel (I have not read the book).  Unable to wait any longer for the film to be released to theaters here in fly over country, I bought the DVD from someone on Ebay, I know it is a bootleg of some sort (The Chinese subtitles were impossible to turn off, partially obscuring Ricci's (...)during the famous topless scene, god I'm a pig).  I know see Miramax's reason for not releasing it when they said, it will have many, many detractors, it would have to.  Lizzy, the main character is crazy.  Just plain crazy.  Crazy is not glamorous or pretty, the film does not take a Terry Gilliam, Pink Floyd inspired stance and glamorize psychotic episodes with wild camera moves or flashy digital hoobajube, it is not Fear and Loathing at Harverd, or create some flavor of tortured artist who uses insanity to create great work.  Instead we are given a very stark, vary real look at a horrible mental condition in which a person can only hurt anyone they love, or indeed anyone around them, hate themselves, feel sorry for themselves, hate themselves for feeling sorry for themselves and wish to die.  As you may have guessed I have had some similar experiences, mine involved substance abuse but I have been on psych wards and have been on medication ( I still am).  Anyone who has been hurt by someone in the state of Lizzy will dislike this film, indeed many people will dislike the film because the main character is not likeable, but that is the point.  The film has a very abrupt ending, like they ran out of film or money or both. Also Prozac is never mentioned in the film until the end and then it is touted as the reason the main character was able to ""get some breathing room"" and write again, thus saving her life,or at least her career, as I understnad it the true story behind this is much more complex.

901658,A3KBCYZ4VX0HN7,B00094ASC2,"J. lacy ""clean food cook""","[1, 1]","Finally got to view this although it's been out for 12 years. Although the trailer and preview states that this is ""a story about a journey into excess"" (or something like that), it's really about real life journalist turned author, Elizabeth Wurtzel's battle with bipolar disorder (this is a psychological disease/illness and much more complex than general depression disorder). So this is more about being out of control from a mental illness than just someone careening carelessly (by choice) into ""a life of excess."" As a teacher's asst. of various psychology courses (university level) in recent years, and, married to a Doctor of the Mind, I (we) were  struck with how well the movie (and it's characters - especially Christina Ricci and Jessica Lange) depicted the raw nature of mental illness and specifically bipolar disorder.You feel as if you are Elizabeth (played brilliantly by Ricci) and caught in an emotional roller coaster that inevitably ends with whiplash. And, any mother who's had a child battle illness or injury will feel their heart wrenched watching Jessica Lange's performance as Elizabeth's mother who sacrifices her own needs and reduces the quality of her life to improve that  of her daughter's.It was also interesting to see Michelle Williams (Broke Back Mountain, My Week With Marilyn), Jonathan Rhys Meyers (King Henry VIII - The Tudors), and Jason Biggs (American Pie) before they all went  on to become well known in bigger roles.Anne Heche, who some consider to be a little 'off' in real life somehow played the most convincing therapist - maybe she went to some good therapists...? But my husband said she ""aced it,"" and I  agree.This is not a 'feel good' Hollywood (give em a happy ending no matter what) movie. This is about real life and mental illness and how easily one can slide into the depths of darkness if not managing and being treated for this disorder.There's also some very good side stories such as the complicated and desperate relationship that Elizabeth has with what society often refers to as a ""dead-beat"" Dad. It also demonstrates Parental Alienation Syndrome (PAS) quite well through that relationship (between daughter, absentee Dad, and the Mom taking on all parental responsibilities and heart-ache).This is a movie everyone should see because depression and other forms of mental illness/psychological disorders are much more common then what our western culture admits to.",5,This is Your Brain in Bipolar Mode,1379721600,"09 21, 2013",2013,2437,"['Finally', 'got', 'view', 'been', '12', 'years', 'trailer', 'preview', 'states', 'story', 'journey', 'excess', 'something', 'really', 'real', 'life', 'journalist', 'turned', 'author', 'Elizabeth', 'Wurtzel', 'battle', 'bipolar', 'disorder', 'psychological', 'disease/illness', 'much', 'more', 'complex', 'general', 'depression', 'disorder', 'more', 'being', 'control', 'mental', 'illness', 'just', 'someone', 'careening', 'carelessly', 'choice', 'life', 'excess', 'teacher', 'asst', 'various', 'psychology', 'courses', 'university', 'level', 'recent', 'years', 'married', 'Doctor', 'Mind', 'were', 'struck', 'how', 'well', 'movie', 'characters', 'especially', 'Christina', 'Ricci', 'Jessica', 'Lange', 'depicted', 'raw', 'nature', 'mental', 'illness', 'specifically', 'bipolar', 'disorder.You', 'feel', 'are', 'Elizabeth', 'played', 'brilliantly', 'Ricci', 'caught', 'emotional', 'roller', 'coaster', 'inevitably', 'whiplash', 'mother', 'who', 'had', 'child', 'battle', 'illness', 'injury', 'will', 'feel', 'heart', 'wrenched', 'watching', 'Jessica', 'Lange', 'performance', 'Elizabeth', 'mother', 'who', 'own', 'needs', 'quality', 'life', 'improve', ""daughter's.It"", 'was', 'also', 'interesting', 'see', 'Michelle', 'Williams', 'Broke', 'Back', 'Mountain', 'My', 'Week', 'Marilyn', 'Jonathan', 'Rhys', 'Meyers', 'King', 'Henry', 'VIII', 'Tudors', 'Jason', 'Biggs', 'American', 'Pie', 'went', 'become', 'well', 'known', 'bigger', 'roles.Anne', 'Heche', 'who', 'consider', 'be', 'little', ""'off"", 'real', 'life', 'somehow', 'played', 'most', 'convincing', 'therapist', 'maybe', 'went', 'good', 'therapists', 'husband', 'said', 'aced', 'agree.This', 'not', ""'feel"", 'good', 'Hollywood', 'give', 'em', 'happy', 'ending', 'matter', 'what', 'movie', 'real', 'life', 'mental', 'illness', 'how', 'easily', 'one', 'can', 'slide', 'depths', 'darkness', 'not', 'managing', 'being', 'treated', 'disorder.There', 'also', 'very', 'good', 'side', 'stories', 'such', 'complicated', 'desperate', 'relationship', 'Elizabeth', 'what', 'society', 'often', 'dead-beat', 'Dad', 'also', 'Parental', 'Alienation', 'Syndrome', 'PAS', 'quite', 'well', 'relationship', 'daughter', 'absentee', 'Dad', 'Mom', 'taking', 'parental', 'responsibilities', 'heart-ache', '.This', 'movie', 'everyone', 'should', 'see', 'depression', 'other', 'forms', 'mental', 'illness/psychological', 'disorders', 'are', 'much', 'more', 'common', 'then', 'what', 'western', 'culture', 'admits']",Prozac Nation

The film is not incredibly fast-moving, but it is thoughtful and sensitive, as is Lizzie (the main character). As her boyfriend says at a point in the film, everything she feels is felt deep down inside of her.Things happen to her that happen to many teenage girls, but to her they cut deeper--are more hurtful. It is this sensitivity that makes Lizzie prone to depression.  Some of the experiences she encounters at college--the brutal drinking and drugs scene (which anyone who has been a college student is probably aware of) as well as the random, loveless hookups--get the best of her and she finds herself spiraling out of control.She dreams of being a writer, but how can she write when the world around her is so careless and hurtful?  The same boy who hooks up with her and leads her into a dangerous drug addiction also denies being her friend once she has given up drugs (for her health).  After making love to her, he said that drugs and sex were both on the same meaningless level to him. When she reacts by objectifying the sex they had and considering it meaningless, he is angered!  This represents a double standard, highlighted in the film--although men can objectify sex, when a woman does the same thing she is looked badly upon (Lizzie, actually, was waiting to lose her virginity by someone who loved her, but he surely did not).It is all of these experiences, combined with the loss of her dad four years before and the stresses of college and writing that send Lizzie into depression--and it is a depression easily understood, for it is partly society-based.  What does it say about our society that doctors need to issue over 300 million prozac prescriptions in a year?  Are we solving society's problems or just glossing over the natural, emotional reactions of an individual living under a flawed system?  How can we fix the deeper problem by glossing over the issue with Prozac?  As Lizzie says, ""this is not the real me."" It is the drug, and we are living in a prozac nation.  These are the questions brought up by the very intelligent and moving film, PROZAC NATION.Perhaps the controversy outweighs the high quality and explains why this film so low-rated.  Surely, the mindless and unsubtle ""The Exorcism of Emily Rose"" did not deserve a higher rating, but of course exorcisms are not nearly as controversial as the problems of Prozac and the society that needs it--because exorcisms are not a real threat.When films are made about real threats to our society, they are ignored, banned, or badly reviewed.

901663,A2FEGRJQNU51P9,B00094ASC2,Joe Sherry,"[4, 9]","I first read Elizabeth Wurtzel's memoir ""Prozac Nation"" when I was in college and I was transfixed.  The force of Wurtzel's personality and the passion in which she wrote honestly jumped off the page as she described her fight with depression and how she acted out and ultimately how Prozac helped her regain control of herself.  Since Wurtzel grew up in the 80's, Prozac was not yet the common medication that it currently is, and was only just beginning to be described.  I believe I first saw a preview for the film version of ""Prozac Nation"" when I was in college and I do know that I've been looking for a release of the movie for at least four years now.  The film never caught a theatrical release, was only recently shunted off to a cable premiere, and is now out on DVD.  Honestly, what took so long?Elizabeth (Christina Ricci) is about to enroll at Harvard University as a freshman.  She has a journalism scholarship.  From the start it is clear that she is somewhat depressed and that she doesn't seem to fit in with the crowds.  She says as much during her opening narration.  It is also quite clear that her mother (Jessica Lange) is somewhat nuts and certainly oblivious to her daughter's pain.  Perhaps it is not that her mother is oblivious, but is purposefully trying to ignore the issue in the hopes that it is suddenly ""all better"" and that it'll go away.  Elizabeth finds solace in her friendship with her new roommate Ruby (Michelle Williams) as the initially seem to be a perfect fit.  She even meets a guy (Jonathan Rhys-Meyers) whom she falls for.Everything seems to be perfect, but considering the source material, the title ""Prozac Nation"", and that there wouldn't be much of a movie if nothing went wrong, something has to change.  What changes is that Elizabeth is unable to deal with the pressures of life.  The stress of school, her journalism, her relationship, her friendship, her mother, her father, and everything else seems to crash down upon her and Elizabeth more than anyone else starts to unconsciously and unthinkingly sabotage herself.""Prozac Nation"" never did receive very much critical acclaim, so this isn't a story about the little movie that could.  The reviews have been mostly negative, scoring a 29% positive on the Tomatometer (at the time of this review).  ""Prozac Nation"" isn't that bad.  It lacks the searing performance of Angelina Jolie in ""Girl, Interrupted"", but it isn't that kind of movie.  Ricci is given something to work with in this movie and does a good job with the role of Elizabeth Wurtzel.  She seems to nail the depression and alienation quite well, though I think the screenwriter didn't quite round the character off as well making Elizabeth a little shrill and not quite as sympathetic as she could have been.  Then again, maybe that really is Wurtzel.  The best performance of the film, however, goes to Michelle Williams, as Ruby.  Ruby is entirely human and warm and believable as a friend and roommate who becomes frustrated by Elizabeth.  It's been several years since she played this role, but I hope it helps to find Williams some quality parts.  This film is directed by Erik Skjoldbjaerg (the original ""Insomnia"", not the American remake).This isn't the best film you will run across, but it is far from the worst and I found myself enjoying the performances of Christina Ricci, Michelle Williams, and even Jason Biggs (yes, he's in it, too).  Biggs is very restrained here and far from his ""American Pie"" days.  If the story itself sounds interesting or Christina Ricci is an actress you would like to see more of, then this is worth seeing.Grade: C+/B--Joe Sherry",3,on being young and depressed in America,1124064000,"08 15, 2005",2005,3646,"['first', 'read', 'Elizabeth', 'Wurtzel', 'memoir', 'Prozac', 'Nation', 'when', 'was', 'college', 'was', 'transfixed', 'force', 'Wurtzel', 'personality', 'passion', 'wrote', 'honestly', 'jumped', 'off', 'page', 'described', 'fight', 'depression', 'how', 'acted', 'out', 'ultimately', 'how', 'Prozac', 'helped', 'regain', 'control', 'herself', 'Wurtzel', 'grew', 'up', '80', 'Prozac', 'was', 'not', 'yet', 'common', 'medication', 'currently', 'was', 'only', 'just', 'beginning', 'be', 'described', 'believe', 'first', 'saw', 'preview', 'film', 'version', 'Prozac', 'Nation', 'when', 'was', 'college', 'do', 'know', ""'ve"", 'been', 'looking', 'release', 'movie', 'least', 'four', 'years', 'now', 'film', 'never', 'caught', 'theatrical', 'release', 'was', 'only', 'recently', 'shunted', 'off', 'cable', 'premiere', 'now', 'out', 'DVD', 'Honestly', 'what', 'took', 'so', 'long', 'Elizabeth', 'Christina', 'Ricci', 'enroll', 'Harvard', 'University', 'freshman', 'journalism', 'scholarship', 'start', 'clear', 'somewhat', 'depressed', ""n't"", 'seem', 'fit', 'crowds', 'as', 'much', 'opening', 'narration', 'also', 'quite', 'clear', 'mother', 'Jessica', 'Lange', 'somewhat', 'nuts', 'certainly', 'oblivious', 'daughter', 'pain', 'Perhaps', 'not', 'mother', 'oblivious', 'purposefully', 'trying', 'ignore', 'issue', 'hopes', 'suddenly', 'better', ""'ll"", 'go', 'away', 'Elizabeth', 'solace', 'friendship', 'new', 'roommate', 'Ruby', 'Michelle', 'Williams', 'initially', 'seem', 'be', 'perfect', 'fit', 'even', 'guy', 'Jonathan', 'Rhys-Meyers', 'whom', 'for.Everything', 'be', 'perfect', 'considering', 'source', 'material', 'title', 'Prozac', 'Nation', 'would', ""n't"", 'be', 'much', 'movie', 'nothing', 'went', 'wrong', 'something', 'change', 'What', 'Elizabeth', 'unable', 'deal', 'pressures', 'life', 'stress', 'school', 'journalism', 'relationship', 'friendship', 'mother', 'father', 'everything', 'else', 'crash', 'down', 'Elizabeth', 'more', 'anyone', 'else', 'unconsciously', 'unthinkingly', 'sabotage', 'Prozac', 'Nation', 'never', 'did', 'receive', 'very', 'much', 'critical', 'acclaim', ""n't"", 'story', 'little', 'movie', 'could', 'reviews', 'have', 'been', 'mostly', 'negative', 'scoring', '29', '%', 'positive', 'Tomatometer', 'time', 'review', 'Prozac', 'Nation', ""n't"", 'bad', 'searing', 'performance', 'Angelina', 'Jolie', 'Girl', 'Interrupted', ""n't"", 'kind', 'movie', 'Ricci', 'given', 'something', 'work', 'movie', 'good', 'job', 'role', 'Elizabeth', 'Wurtzel', 'nail', 'depression', 'alienation', 'quite', 'well', 'think', 'screenwriter', 'did', ""n't"", 'quite', 'round', 'character', 'off', 'as', 'well', 'making', 'Elizabeth', 'little', 'shrill', 'not', 'quite', 'as', 'sympathetic', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'Then', 'again', 'maybe', 'really', 'Wurtzel', 'best', 'performance', 'film', 'however', 'Michelle', 'Williams', 'Ruby', 'Ruby', 'entirely', 'human', 'warm', 'believable', 'friend', 'roommate', 'who', 'frustrated', 'Elizabeth', 'been', 'several', 'years', 'played', 'role', 'hope', 'find', 'Williams', 'quality', 'parts', 'film', 'directed', 'Erik', 'Skjoldbjaerg', 'original', 'Insomnia', 'not', 'American', 'remake', '.This', ""n't"", 'best', 'film', 'will', 'run', 'far', 'worst', 'found', 'enjoying', 'performances', 'Christina', 'Ricci', 'Michelle', 'Williams', 'even', 'Jason', 'Biggs', 'yes', 'too', 'Biggs', 'very', 'restrained', 'here', 'far', 'American', 'Pie', 'days', 'story', 'interesting', 'Christina', 'Ricci', 'actress', 'would', 'like', 'see', 'more', 'then', 'worth', 'seeing.Grade', 'C+/B', 'Joe', 'Sherry']",Prozac Nation

I liked it, but I don't see what all the fuss is about. The movie boasts a tremendous cast including Christina Ricci(Buffalo 66), Oscar Winner Jessica Lange (Best Actress, ""Tootsie""), Oscar Nominee Michelle Williams (Best Supporting Actress, ""Brokeback Mountain""), Jonathan Rhys-Meyers (Match Point), Anne Heche (Psycho),and Jason Biggs (American Pie). Most of the reviews for the film mention how great Ricci is and yes, her performance is great...But it's nothing to brag about.Ricci plays Elizabeth ""Lizzie"" Wurtzel, a girl who thinks her life is hard. Her father left at a young age and turns up periodically and her mother (Lange) is completely overbearing. One thing Lizzie always did well at however was writing and now she's on her way to Harvard. Once there, she has a roommate named Ruby (Williams) and is finally starting to be noticed by boys. The first boy she meets is Noah (Rhys-Meyers) who gives her ecstasy, which is her first experiment with drugs. Pretty soon, despite being fairly successful, she begins a downward spiral. Drugs, sex, drinking, partying. Eventually she begins dating Rafe (Biggs), gets a therapist (Heche), and becomes addicted to Prozac.It's nothing you haven't really seen before. The movie is ultimately unsatisfying. I've never read the book, but I hope it was better than this. I'm giving this movie 4 stars, because while it wasn't satisfying...It wasn't bad. It was entertaining and Ricci does give a pretty good performance. The movie has some interesting theories and interesting dialogue; If it was derived from the book, it's obvious Wurtzel is a pretty good writer. The movie is fairly interesting to an extent, but...Well, I don't know. Don't say I didn't warn you.GRADE: B-P.S.,To answer the obvious question. Yes, there is a nude scene with Christina Ricci.

901675,A6ADO7B6FUVN,B00094ASC2,"Kim Anehall ""www.cinematica.org""","[7, 10]","The best-selling autobiographical novel Prozac Nation by Elizabeth Wurtzel receives a loose adaptation in Erik Skjoldbjrg's version of her handling her own clinical depression.  Since the book is autobiographical one must mention the book in comparison to the film, which is very unlike the novel.  Wurtzel's written version is much darker and more gruesome in its depiction of her depression where she repeatedly tries to commit suicide and has a constant lingering of overwhelming helplessness hanging over her.  The film uses a different approach on depression, as Skjoldbjrg's version is much more subdued in a way that maybe most people could relate to.  Thus, the film does not offer the true story of Elizabeth Wurtzel's struggles, but a tale that maybe could help others to understand.Erik Skjoldbjrg knows how to capture an apprehensive and uneasy atmosphere, which he does brilliantly in his original Norwegian version of Insomnia (1997).  In the film Prozac Nation he introduces the audience to Elizabeth (Christina Ricci) and her dysfunctional family that constantly tears her apart emotionally with their own needs while never considering what their daughter and granddaughter truly need.  Guilt, verbal abuse, and emotional neglect are the daily ordain for Elizabeth around her kin, as she finds a way to relieve herself of her own demons through writing.  Her way to deal is by scribbling down letters, letters to words, words to sentences, sentences to paragraphs, and eventually to complete works.  This becomes her way of dealing with stress, issues, and other predicaments.  In a sense, it becomes her very way of living, as she finds herself publishing her first work in Seventeen Magazine.Elizabeth receives a journalism scholarship to Harvard University where she for the first time gets to bring some distance between her and her mother, Sarah (Jessica Lange), who has been overwhelmingly involved in Elizabeth's life.  It becomes a time of many firsts for her, as she discovers a new side of her that did not exist in high school.  She becomes very involved in writing for the university paper, The Crimson, that opens her doors to the Rolling Stones magazine where she has been asked to write a piece.  However, it becomes a devastating experience for her, as she finds herself lost with unfamiliar emotion that pulls her into a downward spiraling turmoil causing writers block, insomnia, and poor hygiene that also affect her health.  She faces the psychological demon called depression.The chemistry between the parents suggests a troubling upbringing, but also the source of Elizabeth's anxiousness and helpless mindset.  Yet, nothing in the film is definite, and this is important, as there are no one single sources or solutions for clinical depression.  Instead Skjoldbjrg cleverly mixes several complex issues into one organic mix where Elizabeth's persona emerges shaken, lost, and helpless.  Her everyday decisions become shadowed by her own negative view of herself, which she projects onto those around her in a constant need to feel good, but never achieves.  The smallest issues turns into gigantic ordeals causing much pain to her and everyone around her as people slowly begin to drift away from her self-destructive persona.  It is a tragic, disturbing, and painful experience to see all the self-loathing that she illustrates through her thoughts and interactions with people.Prozac Nation will definitely not cheer anyone up, as this cinematic experience will certainly turn into a downer.  The pessimistic and gloomy story of Elizabeth offers an intriguing story that maybe could help some to open their eyes to how some people feel or experience depression.  This is in consideration of a certain movie star's recent arrogant out-lash in media against depression, psychiatry, and psychology as pseudoscience illustrates that there still is ignorance among people in regards to clinical depression.  Nonetheless, Prozac Nation offers one detailed and multifaceted perspective on life in one of its darkest moments, which is very real to those who have suffered from clinical depression.",4,Tragic True Story with an Interesting Cinematic Adaptation...,1120348800,"07 3, 2005",2005,4130,"['best-selling', 'autobiographical', 'novel', 'Prozac', 'Nation', 'Elizabeth', 'Wurtzel', 'loose', 'adaptation', 'Erik', 'Skjoldbjrg', 'version', 'handling', 'own', 'clinical', 'depression', 'book', 'autobiographical', 'one', 'must', 'mention', 'book', 'comparison', 'film', 'very', 'novel', 'Wurtzel', 'written', 'version', 'much', 'darker', 'more', 'gruesome', 'depiction', 'depression', 'where', 'repeatedly', 'commit', 'suicide', 'constant', 'lingering', 'overwhelming', 'helplessness', 'hanging', 'film', 'different', 'approach', 'depression', 'Skjoldbjrg', 'version', 'much', 'more', 'subdued', 'way', 'maybe', 'most', 'people', 'could', 'relate', 'Thus', 'film', 'not', 'offer', 'true', 'story', 'Elizabeth', 'Wurtzel', 'struggles', 'tale', 'maybe', 'could', 'help', 'others', 'understand.Erik', 'Skjoldbjrg', 'how', 'capture', 'apprehensive', 'uneasy', 'atmosphere', 'brilliantly', 'original', 'Norwegian', 'version', 'Insomnia', '1997', 'film', 'Prozac', 'Nation', 'audience', 'Elizabeth', 'Christina', 'Ricci', 'dysfunctional', 'family', 'constantly', 'apart', 'emotionally', 'own', 'needs', 'never', 'considering', 'what', 'daughter', 'granddaughter', 'truly', 'need', 'Guilt', 'verbal', 'abuse', 'emotional', 'neglect', 'are', 'daily', 'ordain', 'Elizabeth', 'kin', 'way', 'relieve', 'herself', 'own', 'demons', 'writing', 'way', 'deal', 'scribbling', 'down', 'letters', 'letters', 'words', 'words', 'sentences', 'sentences', 'paragraphs', 'eventually', 'complete', 'works', 'way', 'dealing', 'stress', 'issues', 'other', 'predicaments', 'sense', 'very', 'way', 'living', 'publishing', 'first', 'work', 'Seventeen', 'Magazine.Elizabeth', 'journalism', 'scholarship', 'Harvard', 'University', 'where', 'first', 'time', 'bring', 'distance', 'mother', 'Sarah', 'Jessica', 'Lange', 'who', 'been', 'overwhelmingly', 'involved', 'Elizabeth', 'life', 'time', 'many', 'firsts', 'new', 'side', 'did', 'not', 'exist', 'high', 'school', 'very', 'involved', 'writing', 'university', 'paper', 'Crimson', 'doors', 'Rolling', 'Stones', 'magazine', 'where', 'been', 'asked', 'write', 'piece', 'However', 'devastating', 'experience', 'lost', 'unfamiliar', 'emotion', 'downward', 'spiraling', 'turmoil', 'causing', 'writers', 'block', 'insomnia', 'poor', 'hygiene', 'also', 'affect', 'health', 'psychological', 'demon', 'called', 'depression.The', 'chemistry', 'parents', 'troubling', 'upbringing', 'also', 'source', 'Elizabeth', 'anxiousness', 'helpless', 'mindset', 'nothing', 'film', 'definite', 'important', 'are', 'one', 'single', 'sources', 'solutions', 'clinical', 'depression', 'Instead', 'Skjoldbjrg', 'cleverly', 'mixes', 'several', 'complex', 'issues', 'one', 'organic', 'mix', 'where', 'Elizabeth', 'persona', 'shaken', 'lost', 'helpless', 'everyday', 'decisions', 'become', 'shadowed', 'own', 'negative', 'view', 'herself', 'projects', 'constant', 'need', 'feel', 'good', 'never', 'achieves', 'smallest', 'issues', 'gigantic', 'ordeals', 'causing', 'much', 'pain', 'everyone', 'around', 'people', 'slowly', 'begin', 'drift', 'away', 'self-destructive', 'persona', 'tragic', 'disturbing', 'painful', 'experience', 'see', 'self-loathing', 'thoughts', 'interactions', 'people.Prozac', 'Nation', 'will', 'definitely', 'not', 'cheer', 'anyone', 'up', 'cinematic', 'experience', 'will', 'certainly', 'turn', 'downer', 'pessimistic', 'gloomy', 'story', 'Elizabeth', 'intriguing', 'story', 'maybe', 'could', 'help', 'open', 'eyes', 'how', 'people', 'feel', 'experience', 'depression', 'consideration', 'certain', 'movie', 'star', 'recent', 'arrogant', 'out-lash', 'media', 'depression', 'psychiatry', 'psychology', 'pseudoscience', 'still', 'ignorance', 'people', 'regards', 'clinical', 'depression', 'Nonetheless', 'Prozac', 'Nation', 'one', 'detailed', 'multifaceted', 'perspective', 'life', 'one', 'darkest', 'moments', 'very', 'real', 'who', 'have', 'suffered', 'clinical', 'depression']",Prozac Nation

She is afraid someone might love her.Christina Ricci perfectly embodies the tortured soul at war with itself.  She fights her way to Harvard, she fights her way to alienation, she fights her way to therapy.  And saddest of all, when she finally responds to therapy, she declares, ""This isn't me.

Despite respectable stars in Christina Ricci, Jason Biggs (American Pie), Anne Heche and Michelle Williams (Brokeback Mountain), it premiered on the Starz channel and then went straight to video. The troubled teen girl genre was probably overdone in the 90s, raising the standard for any new films that delve into the still unsettling issues of female promiscuity, drug abuse, mental illness and eating disorders.The narration by Ricci is the main tie to the novel, but I have always felt narration is used by unimaginitive writers who cannot produce good dialogue. The film centers on a character based on a Harvard freshman who experiments with sex, drugs and other 'bad' behavior with reckless abandon. Not only does she proclaim her loss of virginity in a one-night-stand, she throws a party celebrating the fact. An hour into the movie we are tired of watching the pointless self-destruction of yet another teen girl. It was done much better inThirteenandKids.

While being deeply depressed certainly isn't her fault, Lizzie really refuses to actually WORK with her therapist, Dr. Stirling, to make any mental health progress.

901701,A2PN7Z2VTHICL8,B00094ASC2,"Schtinky ""Schtinky""","[53, 58]","Evidently based on a true story, 'Prozac Nation' documents the life of Elizabeth Wurtzel (played expertly by Christina Ricci), a young woman from a unstable broken family, earns a scholarship to Harvard for a journalism degree.  It's no surprise that Lizzie is depressed, her parents are each dysfunctional in their own right.  Lizzie's mother (skillfully played by Jessica Lange) worries that Lizzie will isolate herself in college.  Lizzie tries not to let her mother down, but depression is not a beast that is so easily tamed.Isolation, substance abuse, withdrawing, avoiding conflict, staying up for days, brain-cycling (like a short circuit), not bathing, sudden outbursts of anger, fear of becoming close to others, subconscious attempts to prove oneself unworthy, obsessive-compulsive behavior, all are signs of clinical depression.  'Prozac Nation', with the expert performance of Christina Ricci, shows every inch of Lizzie's slide into deeper and deeper depression.At one point, Lizzie says, ""How can I escape the demons in my head?""  As a person being successfully treated for clinical depression, this phrase alone literally struck home with me.  'Prozac Nation' is an all-out, no-holes-barred look at what it is like to suffer from this disorder.  The movie is very well done, and you will either find yourself identifying with Lizzie or hating her for being self-centered.Thrown into the mix is the fact that Lizzie is a writer, and very few of the most talented writers would be considered 'normal' people.  Lizzie herself even uses a quote from Hemmingway's ""The Sun Also Rises"" and finds identity within it.  Good writers stay inside their own head too much, and Lizzie has talent in her work, winning the College Journalism Award for 1985.During the course of coping with college, alienating her parents and her best friend, and eventually her boyfriend, Lizzie finds herself in therapy again with Dr. Sterling (played very well, surprisingly, by Anne Heche).  It isn't until many visits with Dr. Sterling and eventually a prescription for Prozac to help her ""gain some perspective and stop spinning out of control"".  At this point, I thought it was a little funny that Lizzie referred to her pharmacy as a ""legal crackhouse"".I thought that this was a beautifully done movie about the realism of clinical depression.  Well filmed, well acted, well set, and with a great script, 'Prozac Nation' deserves much more recognition than it got.  I consider this movie a ""buy"".

901702,A1MHXA59Q9O0GV,B00094ASC2,"Shazzy ""Shazzy""","[13, 15]","It's silly to berate a movie that hasn't even come out. Having read the book, and been down the road of chronic depression for many months, I have to disagree with the first preview that claims this movie unworthy because of the image Wurtzel gives us of depression. Depression, sorry to burst Violetta's bubble, it a unique, personal hard fought battle for evey individual who suffers from it. That just happened to be Wurtzel's experience with her own depression. Needless to say I give the book my highest rating and hope to do the same with the movie. Prozac Nation was one of those movies I wanted to see as soon as I heard about it. I have seen the trailer a few times and couldn't wait for the film to be released into theaters. It was at first in limited release, which I don't understand why since it is a mainstream movie but anyway it finally arrived to my local theater today. So as soon as I could I rushed to the theater to see Prozac Nation.The movie's plot is very simple but at the same time very complex, Lizzie played by the beautiful and talented Christina Ricci is a depressed girl. Following up his critically acclaimed debut Insomnia (1997), Norwegian director Erik Skjoldbjaerg makes his first English-language feature with this adaptation of the novel by Elizabeth Wurtzel. Christina Ricci stars as Lizzie, a prize-winning student heading off to Harvard where she intends to study journalism and launch a career as a rock music critic. However, Elizabeth's fractured family situation including an errant father (Nicholas Campbell) and a neurotic, bitterly hypercritical mother (Jessica Lange) has led to a struggle with depression. When her all-night, drug-fueled writing binges and emotional instability alienate her roommate and best friend, Ruby (Michelle Williams), as well as both her first (Jonathan Rhys-Meyers) and second (Jason Biggs) boyfriends, Lizzie seeks psychiatric counseling from Dr. Diana Sterling (Anne Heche), who prescribes the wonder drug Prozac. Despite success as a writer that includes a gig writing for Rolling Stone and some mellowing out thanks to her medication, Lizzie begins to feel that the pills are running her life and faces some tough choices about her future. Prozac Nation (2001) is a longtime dream project of star Ricci, who also serves as one of the film's co-producers. Prozac Nation then starts to develop into an unusual and original movie, which I for one have never seen before. A lot of symbolism, terrific acting, and a lot of dark past scenes ensue.In this film I really could not believe the acting. It was terrific all around. Christina Ricci proves that she can hold a lead role and do it flawlessly. Her role was perfect and involved a lot of different emotions, which she played off like a natural. But Christina Ricci's acting isn't the highlight of this film, that award goes to Jessica Lange who plays her role like she actually was going though this in real life. Her incredible acting kept getting stronger throughout the entire film. The supporting actors and actresses were all good as well. Michelle Williams who played Ruby, was really good in her role. Emily Perkins who played Ellen was very good as well as Anne Heche who played the doctor Sterling.The film's script was another strong point. It was very good! I never knew what was going to happen next. I thought I did a few times but I was wrong. The script also had a lot of symbolism in it and if you watch the movie closely you will be able to catch it. I also like how the movie didn't have the typical Hollywood ending at the end. It was very different and I didn't expect what happened to happen. The writer, Galt Niederhoffer did a great job and surprisingly this was his second film. I wish I could shake this man's hand for making such a great piece of cinema. I am really looking forward to his next movie Lonesome Jim that comes out in 2005. I loved the director's use of camera angles and the many views of various landscapes and the sky. It was very creative.So what else can I say about the film, it was very independent like which I am sure will turn the normal moviegoers off right away. The movie moves slowly to build its story and suspense. It does this flawlessly. It's really amazing. If you want a great movie that has an unusual and original story, great acting and lots of hidden messages and symbolism then go see Prozac Nation and enjoy. If you don't like movies that make you think then skip this one because it's not for you. It was a terrific film from a great new director.I've been looking forward to seeing Prozac Nation since I first saw the poster for the film. The poster itself seemed rather amusing and then when I had seen the trailer for the film and wanted to watch the film even more. I usually enjoy Christina Ricci on the big screen. She is definitely a great actress. Lots of clever dialog, great acting, and a unique story ensue.The acting in the film was top notch. I think Christina Ricci's performance was very noteworthy. I liked her character. Lizzie was nice girl who was very sweet and innocent. Jonathan Rhys-Meyers performance was another great role for his resume. I liked how his character had many sides to him. I felt they all played their characters well.I think what is amazing about the script is the fact that a. the writer never wrote a film anything like it before and b. it's a very original film. I know I haven't seen every movie but I never seen a movie like this. The story was unique, the characters were likable, and the dialog was rather clever. I applaud these two screenwriters for their effort on the script. Sadly I doubt the movie will do well. There was only three people in the theater counting me and the story is rather odd and original so I don't know if it will really trigger much interest from the typical moviegoers.Erik Skjoldbjrg was the director of Prozac Nation. I have not seen his movies Insomnia yet but I'll watch it as soon as I can get my paws on it. I liked how in the film, Erik Skjoldbjrg really captured being in Harvard and being depressed, showing everyone in the opening scene of the film. It really lets you know how life is for Lizzie. The director also did a good job of directing the actors and making them connect. I really felt for the characters in this film. I liked that they had this great connection with each other on screen.So to summarize, I overall really enjoyed Prozac Nation. The cast is great, as is its story. I feel the film won't attract much attention since the crap fest wholesome teen movies and sex comedies rule the box office, it's an indie film and the fact that Prozac Nation itself isn't aimed at the average moviegoer crowd. I recommend this film though to anyone who wants to see a film that is smart, original and witty. It delivers great performances and some sad moments. I really enjoyed the film and will probably go see it again if I can.",4,Good Story Great Acting!,1136332800,"01 4, 2006",2006,6924,"['silly', 'berate', 'movie', ""n't"", 'even', 'come', 'out',

The scene where she's screaming at her ex-husband over the phone, smashing everything, is pure Faye Dunaway doing Mommie Dearest. It is so overdone you find yourself laughing.Then, there's the drunk scene, where Christina Ricci is totally bombed and freaks out her grandparents when they come over for her birthday party. The grandparents are horrified, while her mother keeps telling them she's fine. Hilarious!Also, the scene in which Ricci forces her boyfriend, Jason Biggs, to introduce her to his family, could be a skit from Saturday Night Live. It turns out he has a mentally disabled sister who is either retarded or has some sort of syndrome. When they eat at the dinner table, the look on Ricci's face is priceless. The girl throws tantrums like Ricci, only she's retarded and later Ricci accuses Biggs that's why he's attracted to her, because she's as messed up as his sister!!Also, Anne Heche is terrible as the psychiatrist. She has such a self-satisfied smirk you want to slap her. She looks like she'd rather be playing tennis than listening to her agonized patient. Who would want her for a shrink?I predict this will be a camp classic, like Mommie Dearest, within the decade.

901711,A1SPB225CVTRUU,B00094ASC2,"Wing Lee ""filmfan""","[8, 9]","As I was renting this DVD at the store, I was told by the clerk that this film was just crap, and that he just wished that Christina Ricci's character just kill herself. I rented it anyways, because I wanted to see Jessica Lange. I am aware that this film had been made more than two years ago, and finally went straight to video. What a drag? That didn't stop me from enjoying this film, and just the same reason I was so sympathetic towards depressed characters like last years Kim Basinger in The Door In The Floor. This film certainly devides the audiences into two sides. One will understand and appreciate the importance of the mental health issues dealt with in this film, and the others will reject and hate this film because they can't relate to what it's like to be in Elizabeth's shoes. The bottom line is that being depressed is hard enough, and sometimes beyond the theapy sessions, the anti-depressants have to be the final treatment, despite the lack of acceptance by non-depressed folks.Yes, I can relate to Christina Ricci's situation. Her self-centered and irresponsible father(Nicolas Campbell) abandoned her at teenage, leaving in the custody of her neurotic and controlling mother(Lange). She's a talented and aspiring journalist/music critic. Her mother gave her all to make sure she gets into Harvard, but things turned ugly when her friendship and relationships goes into chaos, and she gradually falls into a deep state of depression. Sadly, her mother doesn't understand why she can't ""get over it"" and stop being self-destructive. She is sent to many theapy sessions with Dr. Sterling(a subtle and confident Anne Heche), but she still had to go on Prozac for good, at least until she's back to herself again....Jessica Lange and Christina Ricci had numerous heavy duty emotional fight scenes together, and they were equally powerful and mesmerizing. Michelle Williams and Jason Biggs had some strong moments to work with as Ricci's best friend and love interest. Overall, this film has TV movie of the week feel and it's weakness is on the direction and editing mostly. The cast is much more worthwhile.",4,"""It Takes One to Know One.""",1133308800,"11 30, 2005",2005,2130,"['was', 'renting', 'DVD', 'store', 'was', 'told', 'clerk', 'film', 'was', 'just', 'crap', 'just', 'wished', 'Christina', 'Ricci', 'character', 'just', 'kill', 'rented', 'wanted', 'see', 'Jessica', 'Lange', 'am', 'aware', 'film', 'had', 'been', 'made', 'more', 'two', 'years', 'ago', 'finally', 'went', 'straight', 'video', 'What', 'drag', 'did', ""n't"", 'stop', 'enjoying', 'film', 'just', 'same', 'reason', 'was', 'so', 'sympathetic', 'towards', 'depressed', 'characters', 'last', 'years', 'Kim', 'Basinger', 'Door', 'Floor', 'film', 'certainly', 'audiences', 'two', 'sides', 'One', 'will', 'understand', 'appreciate', 'importance', 'mental', 'health', 'issues', 'dealt', 'film', 'others', 'will', 'reject', 'hate', 'film', 'ca', ""n't"", 'relate', 'what', 'be', 'Elizabeth', 'shoes', 'bottom', 'line', 'being', 'depressed', 'hard', 'enough', 'sometimes', 'theapy', 'sessions', 'anti-depressants', 'have', 'be', 'final', 'treatment', 'lack', 'acceptance', 'non-depressed', 'folks.Yes', 'can', 'relate', 'Christina', 'Ricci', 'situation', 'self-centered', 'irresponsible', 'father', 'Nicolas', 'Campbell', 'abandoned', 'teenage', 'leaving', 'custody', 'neurotic', 'controlling', 'mother', 'Lange', 'talented', 'aspiring', 'journalist/music', 'critic', 'mother', 'gave', 'make', 'sure', 'Harvard', 'things', 'turned', 'ugly', 'when', 'friendship', 'relationships', 'chaos', 'gradually', 'deep', 'state', 'depression', 'Sadly', 'mother', ""n't"", 'understand', 'why', 'ca', ""n't"", 'get', 'stop', 'being', 'self-destructive', 'sent', 'many', 'theapy', 'sessions', 'Dr.', 'Sterling', 'subtle', 'confident', 'Anne', 'Heche', 'still', 'had', 'go', 'Prozac', 'good', 'least', 'back', 'herself', 'again', '.Jessica', 'Lange', 'Christina', 'Ricci', 'had', 'numerous', 'heavy', 'duty', 'emotional', 'fight', 'scenes', 'together', 'were', 'equally', 'powerful', 'mesmerizing', 'Michelle', 'Williams', 'Jason', 'Biggs', 'had', 'strong', 'moments', 'work', 'Ricci', 'best', 'friend', 'love', 'interest', 'Overall', 'film', 'TV', 'movie', 'week', 'feel', 'weakness', 'direction', 'editing', 'mostly', 'cast', 'much', 'more', 'worthwhile']",Prozac Nation
