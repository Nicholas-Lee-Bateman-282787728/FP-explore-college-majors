1067717,A31I3HXMD5H1EL,B000P0I4O4,Benjamin J Burgraff,"[0, 1]","Bruce Beresford is a remarkable Australian director, skilled at nearly every genre (fromDriving Miss DaisytoTender Mercies, fromBlack RobetoDouble Jeopardy), but sometimes a project just doesn't quite gel. 2006's ""The Contract"" is a case in point.The story of a ex-military-trained paid assassin (Morgan Freeman), leading a team on a high-level 'hit' under orders from 'the Executive Branch' (represented by senior agent Alice Krige), winding up in the middle of the wilderness as the accidental prisoner of an ex-cop/gym teacher (John Cusack) and his son (Jamie Anderson), with good AND bad guys after them, is enjoyable, but simply doesn't hold up to close scrutiny.With the star power involved, a gifted young performer (Anderson), making his acting debut, a crew of brilliant award-winning technicians, and fabulous locations (primarily in Bulgaria's lush wilderness), you would expect something really special. But the script, originally written by the late Stephen Katz, then updated and polished by first-time scribe, John Darrouzet, borrows heavily from many sources (includingThe River Wild,Shoot to Kill, BOTH versions of3:10 to Yuma, and more), and simply never creates any real tension. The film seems more a series of strung-together moments, than a decisive 'whole'. Many are entertaining (Cusack's lack of enthusiasm about camping, Freeman's remark about the kind of school Cusack would teach at), some are moving (Anderson attempting to explain the rift with his father), some ridiculous (Why would you climb down a mountain in a rainstorm? And how do two killers and Cusack ALL arrive at the exact same location, at the same instance?), some gratuitous (poor Megan Dodd, the closest thing to a 'romantic interest' in the film, does a totally unnecessary nude scene when she first appears).Apparently, financing was a major problem during production (the list of producers in the opening credits is huge), and Beresford invested his own money to finish the film; it then went directly to DVD (I found no box office totals listed for the film). All of which explains why this 2006 release received so little fanfare.If you are a fan of Beresford, Freeman and/or Cusack, I think you'll still enjoy this film (there is a very entertaining 'Making Of' documentary in the Special Features, with their observations), and I admit, I've seen MUCH worse than ""The Contract"".

Then again their names were the only reason I picked this up, so maybe the studio's ploy worked, and it's actually their performances that saved it from being unwatchable.Cusack is having father/son issues with the teen after his wife passes away from cancer. In an attempt to devote some ""quality time"" and bond with his son they go on a camping trip in the Washington state wilderness. Unfortunately for them, rogue CIA spook Freeman happens to be en route to prosecution in that area when his mercenary buddies try to free him. The escape scenario doesn't go as smoothly as planned and Freeman ends up in the unwanted ""custody"" of Cusack (who just happens to be an ex-cop turned teacher) with the help of an errant handgun. In the middle of the nowhere they look to evade the trailing mercenaries and get to safety.There are way too many implausiblities and cliches in the story to make this a good film (e.g., why wouldn't Cusack just take Freeman's advice and the gun, leave and not put his son in harm's way?). The meeting of the other hiking couple was totally unnecessary and felt tacked on just to try to add some drama at the last scene. The action was OK, but rote and implausible again.

That said, it is clearly Morgan Freeman who carries the weight of this otherwise forgettable movie on his shoulders as a hitman with a heart-as long as it's not you who happens to be the target of his latest contract. John Cusak as the middling dad forced into a bad situation has to overcome some implausibly bad odds at times as he outwits Freeman's cohorts and another assassin intent on killing Freeman (it will come as no surprise as to who hired this cheeseball). There are plenty of moments where the characters get to know each other that Freeman plays beautifully. The actor playing Cusak's son offers no chops whatsoever as a teen troubled with the usual vice of pot smoking and he delivers lines more mechanically than the robot on Lost in Space. He is a complete waste as is much of the writing for his character. The backdrop of the film, the wonderful wooded vistas provide visual fodder and were clearly the director's main interest.

Not long into the trip they stumble over a dying police chief with his prisoner Cardin (Morgan), an ex-CIA and military trained professional assassin in the process of being freed by his team. Ray thinks he must play hero and bring Cardin back into custody. Along the way he brings more harmless hikers into trouble and eventually actually loses Cardin despite all heroic efforts.Kusack only makes an okay transition from regular guy to hero. Harrison Ford or Michael Douglas are way better at that. So he was a former cop, which explains that he outsmarts and outshoots a red-hot assassin. Nevertheless, the way he gets more and more fixated on turning in Cardin at the cost of risking his boy's life must seem unnatural to any parent. Morgan of course turns in one of his usual superb performances. He is actually likeable even as a pretty bad guy, showing his human side when saving the boy from falling down a rain-soaked mountain wall. A certain bonding is becoming evident between him and the teacher and boy, which in the end may very well save the lives of those two. Why Cardin is just cooperating with Ray all the time is not believable to me. If he had just sat down in the very beginning, what would Ray have done? Shot him?

1067737,A2YM3KILJ1G0YJ,B000P0I4O4,Jason,"[2, 3]","In this clich&eacute;-riddled drama/thriller, John Cusack and Morgan Freeman turn in tired performances for a quick cash payout.  Either filming was directly after daily morning marathons, there were epic late night whiskey drinking contests, or both had substantial mob loans with escalating vigs.  To say they were less than vehement would be like saying the Bataan Death March was less than energetic.  Don't get me wrong.  Both are great actors and did fairly well compared to others.  Hence, the issue.  The remaining cast literally gave me an ulcer, and a child actor made me seriously consider a vasectomy.The plot, if you can call it that, is a tale as derivative as the 6th Police Academy movie.  But maybe not as good.  Ray (Cusack) is a gym teacher who has experienced problems lately.  Father-son drama after Mom died (or left because of the kid's acting), son gets into a little Mary Jane, camping ensues.  Because, like, the kid was an aspiring Eagle Scout or something and this will totally get them to overcome their transparently poor attempt to look at odds with one another.  Don't worry, it's hardly explained in the movie either.  Things go awry when filming starts...I mean, when they run into Frank (Freeman), an assassin with government/CIA ties, and his team of incompetent mercenaries who possess slightly more training than the local donut munching police in the non-distinct woodsy Washington town.  Ray is positioned as a pawn who must deliver Frank to the law.  Along the journey plot incontinence occurs.Character development is atrocious.  Aside from the aforementioned, the details are minimal.  We learn nothing of Frank's past, his motives, or his training.  It's all thinly veiled masturbatory excerpts from dog-eared Soldier of Fortune magazines.  His mid-movie acquisition of a conscious is even more poorly contrived.  Oh, did I mention that the only reason a trained merc. isn't gutting Ray's kid, decorating the forest with his entrails, and happily escaping is that Ray used to be a cop?  Because totally explains how he is able to not only control Frank but also survive the Three Stooges routine from the others.  Speaking of plot problems.  Off the top of my head, the helicopter scene was ridiculous, the midway addition to the cast is unexplainable fodder, and the twists involving federal agents were so underdeveloped they should have been deleted scenes.  The most egregious gaffe, however, is the murderer who stops mid-hunt, while just behind the guy he plans to kill, while hoping to save his boss who has all monetary access, while in a dense, cell coverage eliminating forest, to play chess online.  Read that again.Add in an ending that had all the deliberation of a duck-walk to the bathroom after a 3-day Taco Bell bender and you have a movie that not only deserved to go straight to the DVD bin despite its two stars, but maybe didn't deserve that much.

'Scripters Stephen Katz and John Darrouzet don't inspire great expectations with their contrived setup, so it can't be said that what follows -- pretty much your standard-issue, pursuit-through-the-wilderness melodrama -- is, in the strictest sense of the term, disappointing. But it's more than fair to complain about the plodding predictability of a by-the-numbers scenario that, 30 years ago, might have served as the blueprint for a routine TV movie. (Think Darren McGavin in Freeman's role, then sub in Doug McClure for Cusack.)'There it is concisely; a predictable by the numbers thriller that went straight to DVD despite starring Morgan Freeman and John Cusack.This is a remarkably average film. Morgan Freeman plays an old sardonic assassin. A bad guy with depth, education and possibly (could it be) a heart. In other words the usual Morgan Freeman role. Like Alan Arkin, Freeman has comfortable found a persona that gathers a steady paycheck. To Freeman's credit, at least he is fun to watch and has fun with the role.That certainly cannot be said of John Cusack's overly serious, charisma free turn as the recently widowed, and ex-cop single father. Cusack acts as if he is spending the entire movie working on a particularly troublesome bowl movement. Considering the lightweight proceedings around him, and co-star Freeman's paycheck turn; this method acting madness seems out of place.The plot summarized is Freeman get captured, escapes while in handcuffs, gets recaptured by Cusack on a father son bonding hike, then they all find themselves on the run with Freeman's fellow assassins and the FBI in pursuit.One strange development is the attempt to give widowed Cusack a love interest in the middle of the forest. Cusack and son run into a hot blonde, Calista Flockheart lookalike skinny dipping (attractive Megan Dodds) and her fianc&eacute;. Cusack somehow convinces them that he is an okay guy; even though he is in the woods with a gun pointed at a handcuffed, elderly black man.The fianc&eacute; is a funny character. A San Francisco lawyer, who hate the wilderness, has an effeminate manner and wears (you cannot make this up) an ascot. What? Is the Mystery Machine parked nearby? Needless to say, he gets killed by a sniper to make room for Cusack. His fianc&eacute;es reaction to his bloody death? 'meh'.Which nicely sums up my reaction to this movie.",3,The Contract...

1067749,A2NJO6YE954DBH,B000P0I4O4,Lawrance M. Bernabo,"[1, 3]","I could not find any box office information for ""The Contract,"" which is interesting because you would not think of either Morgan Freeman or John Cusak as doing direct to video movies.  The same would be said for director Bruce Beresford, whose ""Breaker Morant"" has always been a personal favorite and who was not nominated for an Oscar for directing ""Driving Miss Daisy.""  But the explanation for this anomaly is that this 2007 film comes from Millennium Films, which is the theatrical wing of Nu Image and the fact of the matter is that I only checked out ""The Contract"" because it had both Freeman and Cusak (although I will admit that having either one of them would normally be a good enough reason to check out a film).  But despite their presence and something of little twist regarding the plot in the end game, this movie never really commands our attention as it keeps itself to doing things by the numbers and never offering the sort of memorable moment or thrilling sequence you would like to see in such a movie.  At least Freeman and Cusak got to spend several weeks in Bulgaria making this film.Freeman is Frank Cordell, who is not merely a professional assassin: he and his team kill their targets by making them look like accidents.  This could be pretty cool, but the script by Stephen Katz and John Darrouzet keeps things fairly simple for the two examples we get to see of Cordell and his team doing their jobs.  However, keeping things simple does not pay off this time as Cordell is captured and his team comes up with a plan to get him back.  Meanwhile, out in the forest is Ray Keene, played by Kusak, a man who has lost his wife to cancer and has taken his son, Chris (Jamie Anderson), camping.  They are not getting along and Ray is hoping some time together will help them bound, but apparently he has no other ideas on how to reconnect with the boy.  The next thing Ray knows he and Chris meet up with not only Cordell, but also a dying FBI agent who gives Ray his gun and tells him to get his prisoner to the authorities.  Obviously, this is going to be a most unusual camping trip.Fortunately, Ray used to be a cop, although when he announces the fact it is news to us.  Cordell tries to reason with Ray, explaining that his guys are coming and Ray does not stand a chance.  Of course the good guys are coming too, but there are more plot complications to come because Cordell has another job to do and being captured greatly impairs his ability to do his job.  The supporting cast is pretty good, but except for Freeman, none of them are given anything interesting to say, let alone do.  Alice Krige plays one of the suits in Washington, D.C., with a vested interst in what is going on, and Megan Dodds, looking considerably more like a human being than she did as the wicked step sister in ""Ever After,"" plays Sandra, a woman they meet in the woods who gets caught up in the misadventure.  Bill Smitrovich plays the local cop, who alternates between being a shade too smart or a step too slow in dealing with the developing situation.Yet despite the cast, ""The Contract"" is a wash as a film.  If Freeman was not in it, I might have fallen asleep while watching it, because even if he was not being given anything really interesting to say he is of the class of actors that make the recitation of the phone book compelling.  I can even make the argument that the title gives away what should have been the twists and turns in the final act that changed everything and made this film more interesting.  Maybe having a first class musical score would have punched up things some more, but ""The Contact"" does not have that either.  Ultimately, a film begins with the words on the script, and beyond the basic plot that somehow got this cast to sign up, there is simply nothing there to help the director and cast get this thriller to a level where it would be worth watching twice, let alone once.",3,Bruce Beresford directs Morgan Freeman and John Cusak in an uninspiring thriller,1188950400,"09 5, 2007",2007,3925,"['could', 'not', 'find', 'box', 'office', 'information', 'Contract', 'interesting', 'would', 'not', 'think', 'Morgan', 'Freeman', 'John', 'Cusak', 'doing', 'direct', 'video', 'movies', 'same', 'would', 'be', 'said', 'director', 'Bruce', 'Beresford', 'Breaker', 'Morant', 'always', 'been', 'personal', 'favorite', 'who', 'was', 'not', 'nominated', 'Oscar', 'directing', 'Driving', 'Miss', 'Daisy', 'explanation', 'anomaly', '2007', 'film', 'Millennium', 'Films', 'theatrical', 'wing', 'Nu', 'Image', 'fact', 'matter', 'only', 'checked', 'Contract', 'had', 'Freeman', 'Cusak', 'will', 'admit', 'having', 'one', 'would', 'normally', 'be', 'good', 'enough', 'reason', 'check', 'out', 'film', 'presence', 'something', 'little', 'twist', 'regarding', 'plot', 'end', 'game', 'movie', 'never', 'really', 'attention', 'doing', 'things', 'numbers', 'never', 'offering', 'sort', 'memorable', 'moment', 'thrilling', 'sequence', 'would', 'like', 'see', 'such', 'movie', 'least', 'Freeman', 'Cusak', 'got', 'spend', 'several', 'weeks', 'Bulgaria', 'making', 'film.Freeman', 'Frank', 'Cordell', 'who', 'not', 'merely', 'professional', 'assassin', 'team', 'kill', 'targets', 'making', 'look', 'accidents', 'could', 'be', 'pretty', 'cool', 'script', 'Stephen', 'Katz', 'John', 'Darrouzet', 'things', 'fairly', 'simple', 'two', 'examples', 'get', 'see', 'Cordell', 'team', 'doing', 'jobs', 'However', 'keeping', 'things', 'simple', 'not', 'pay', 'off', 'time', 'Cordell', 'captured', 'team', 'up', 'plan', 'get', 'back', 'Meanwhile', 'out', 'forest', 'Ray', 'Keene', 'played', 'Kusak', 'man', 'who', 'lost', 'wife', 'cancer', 'taken', 'son', 'Chris', 'Jamie', 'Anderson', 'camping', 'are', 'not', 'getting', 'along', 'Ray', 'hoping', 'time', 'together', 'will', 'help', 'bound', 'apparently', 'other', 'ideas', 'how', 'reconnect', 'boy', 'next', 'thing', 'Ray', 'Chris', 'meet', 'up', 'not', 'only', 'Cordell', 'also', 'dying', 'FBI', 'agent', 'who', 'Ray', 'gun', 'get', 'prisoner', 'authorities', 'Obviously', 'going', 'be', 'most', 'unusual', 'camping', 'trip.Fortunately', 'Ray', 'used', 'be', 'cop', 'when', 'fact', 'news', 'Cordell', 'reason', 'Ray', 'explaining', 'guys', 'are', 'coming', 'Ray', 'not', 'stand', 'chance', 'course', 'good', 'guys', 'are', 'coming', 'too', 'are', 'more', 'plot', 'complications', 'come', 'because', 'Cordell', 'job', 'do', 'being', 'captured', 'greatly', 'ability', 'do', 'job', 'supporting', 'cast', 'pretty', 'good', 'Freeman', 'none', 'are', 'given', 'anything', 'interesting', 'say', 'let', 'alone', 'do', 'Alice', 'Krige', 'one', 'suits', 'Washington', 'D.C.', 'vested', 'interst', 'what', 'going', 'Megan', 'Dodds', 'looking', 'considerably', 'more', 'human', 'being', 'did', 'wicked', 'step', 'sister', 'Ever', 'Sandra', 'woman', 'meet', 'woods', 'who', 'caught', 'up', 'misadventure', 'Bill', 'Smitrovich', 'local', 'cop', 'who', 'being', 'shade', 'too', 'smart', 'step', 'too', 'slow', 'dealing', 'developing', 'situation.Yet', 'cast', 'Contract', 'wash', 'film', 'Freeman', 'was', 'not', 'might', 'have', 'fallen', 'asleep', 'watching', 'even', 'was', 'not', 'being', 'given', 'anything', 'really', 'interesting', 'say', 'class', 'actors', 'make', 'recitation', 'phone', 'book', 'compelling', 'can', 'even', 'make', 'argument', 'title', 'away', 'what', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'twists', 'turns', 'final', 'act', 'changed', 'everything', 'made', 'film', 'more', 'interesting', 'Maybe', 'having', 'first', 'class', 'musical', 'score', 'would', 'have', 'punched', 'up', 'things', 'more', 'Contact', 'not', 'have', 'Ultimately', 'film', 'words', 'script', 'basic', 'plot', 'somehow', 'got', 'cast', 'sign', 'up', 'simply', 'nothing', 'there', 'help', 'director', 'cast', 'get', 'thriller', 'level', 'where', 'would', 'be', 'worth', 'watching', 'twice', 'let', 'alone', 'once']",The Contract

Not that these guys have never made a bad movie, but they've certainly never made a movie worse.  The same is true here, although the movie was already pretty bad to begin with.Gym teacher Ray Keene (Cusack at his most vacant) has a pubescent son who is grappling with several dull plot contrivances (the Dead Mom and Infrequent Pot Smoking).  In an attempt to bond with him before he goes too far down the wrong path, Ray takes his boy hiking.  Turns out they BOTH end up down the wrong path, in the middle of which is escaped-assassin, Frank (Freeman, who gives new meaning to the phrase ""phoning it in"").  Frank is pursued by his team of assisstants (assassisstants?), who want badly to be paid, but not far behind are also a group of snobbish U.S. Marshalls who have their own agendas.  It's Ray's job to avoid these two deadly (?) forces and bring Frank to justice.No, wait.  Ray's job is a gym coach, making the next several hours of his life a pretty amazing feat, as he scales bluffs, outwits and outmanuevers a whole cadre of military-trained mercenaries and political heavies that appear to have no skills beyond complaining about coffee and smirking smugly at the incompetent local lawmen.  And, to be fair, the local lawmen are remarkably incompetent.Who wrote this thing?  Furthermore, how did they getDriving Miss Daisy's Bruce Beresford to direct?  That must be, at least, how they got Freeman to lend his Oscar-winning weight to the title.  And that would explain Cusack (because who WOULDN'T want to star next to the incomparable Freeman?).  But none of it explains the script's tired dialogue (""You said mom would be okay!"" Ray's son, Chris, keens.  ""But she wasn't okay!  She wasn't okay!"").  None of it explains the crumpled story-line or the ludicrously two-dimensional characters (Alice Krige's skullish Gwen Miles is so flat she seems concaved).  And the plot holes!  Let's just say that they eventually become an acquired taste.  By the time you get to the scene I call the ""Helicopter Crash Conversation,"" you'll be shaking your head AND laughing.The really funny thing, though, is that it's obvious SOMEONE put a lot of work into the film.  Certain scenes (the hit-and-run at the start, the accident that leads to Frank's initial capture) are smartly done.  And in the hands of an abler scribe (it was penned by the late Stephen Katz, who did mostly teleplays forThe A-TeamandHardcastle and McCormick) it might have pulled together into something you could take a passing interest in.

It's beautifully shot, as well-acted as it needs to be, and hits on all the right notes. Simply put, this is a movie that gets it right, without making a lot of unnecessary noise.Part of that formula is in the cast. When you have two actors like Morgan Freeman and John Cusack - both almost instantly likeable in any role - as characters on opposite sides, you immediately set up a situation where it's hard to know who the ""hero"" of the movie is. 'The Contract' is not a standout role for either actor, but they treat the story with respect and give it the right tone. With these two actors, surrounded by a good supporting cast (including Alice Krige and Jonathan Hyde), you never really know whose side is the ""right"" side. This dynamic creates a complexity and an unpredictability that is refreshing in a suspense film, a dynamic carried through in the story.The plot advances steadily from multiple perspectives, paced well and with plenty of surprise in store. Former police officer (now teacher) John Cusack crosses paths with hitman Morgan Freeman in the middle of trying to fulfill a contract, with Freeman's team of assassins following close behind. Familiarity of the territory and the element of surprise are played against ruthlessness and expertise. Layers of deception unfold and change the story's direction, moving steadily towards an ending that remains uncertain until the final minutes.The cinematography is handsome without being distracting, capturing unique angles but always with a focus on advancing the story. The action scenes come together particularly well, not relying on fast edits and extreme close-ups of blurry motion to create tension - the tension is there in the story already, the angle and the editing simply serve that well, understated and elegant.'The Contract' is unpredictable and engaging, entertaining and thoughtful. All the elements for a good movie are here, and they're brought together skillfully and well. It may not have that blockbuster quality, lots of special effects, or an Oscar-caliber performance from either of its two headline actors. It doesn't need any of those things.All I know is that it kept me guessing, kept me entertained, and I enjoyed it from the first minute to the last.",5,Understated and flawless,1306368000,"05 26, 2011",2011,2327,"['nothing', 'flashy', 'showy', ""'The"", 'Contract', 'there', ""n't"", 'need', 'be', 'beautifully', 'shot', 'as', 'well-acted', 'be', 'hits', 'right', 'notes', 'Simply', 'put', 'movie', 'right', 'making', 'lot', 'unnecessary', 'noise.Part', 'formula', 'cast', 'When', 'have', 'two', 'actors', 'Morgan', 'Freeman', 'John', 'Cusack', 'almost', 'instantly', 'likeable', 'role', 'characters', 'opposite', 'sides', 'immediately', 'set', 'up', 'situation', 'where', 'hard', 'know', 'who', 'hero', 'movie', 'Contract', 'not', 'standout', 'role', 'actor', 'treat', 'story', 'respect', 'give', 'right', 'tone', 'two', 'actors', 'surrounded', 'good', 'supporting', 'cast', 'including', 'Alice', 'Krige', 'Jonathan', 'Hyde', 'never', 'really', 'know', 'side', 'right', 'side', 'dynamic', 'complexity', 'unpredictability', 'refreshing', 'suspense', 'film', 'dynamic', 'carried', 'story.The', 'plot', 'advances', 'steadily', 'multiple', 'perspectives', 'paced', 'well', 'plenty', 'surprise', 'store', 'Former', 'police', 'officer', 'now', 'teacher', 'John', 'Cusack', 'paths', 'hitman', 'Morgan', 'Freeman', 'middle', 'trying', 'fulfill', 'contract', 'Freeman', 'team', 'assassins', 'following', 'close', 'Familiarity', 'territory', 'element', 'surprise', 'are', 'played', 'ruthlessness', 'expertise', 'Layers', 'deception', 'unfold', 'change', 'story', 'direction', 'moving', 'steadily', 'ending', 'uncertain', 'final', 'minutes.The', 'cinematography', 'handsome', 'being', 'distracting', 'capturing', 'unique', 'angles', 'always', 'focus', 'advancing', 'story', 'action', 'come', 'together', 'particularly', 'well', 'not', 'relying', 'fast', 'edits', 'extreme', 'close-ups', 'blurry', 'motion', 'create', 'tension', 'tension', 'there', 'story', 'already', 'angle', 'editing', 'simply', 'serve', 'well', 'understated', 'elegant', 'Contract', 'unpredictable', 'engaging', 'entertaining', 'thoughtful', 'elements', 'good', 'movie', 'are', 'here', ""'re"", 'brought', 'together', 'skillfully', 'well', 'may', 'not', 'have', 'blockbuster', 'quality', 'lots', 'special', 'effects', 'Oscar-caliber', 'performance', 'two', 'headline', 'actors', ""n't"", 'need', 'things.All', 'know', 'kept', 'guessing', 'kept', 'entertained', 'enjoyed', 'first', 'minute', 'last']",The Contract

I don't claim this would be the best movie you've ever seen (hence the 4 stars here, rather than 5, and for some perhaps even those 4 stars are being generous), but I don't think it's that bad either.Premise is simple enough with John Cusack's character trying to connect with his son and taking him out for a camping trip that just happens to have both of them crossing paths with an 'exterminator' (of humans) in the form of Morgan Freeman's character.Much of the film was made in the Pacific Northwest and it helps to provide some awe inspiring scenery in the background.  Some viewers would complain though that where that scenery is there should be more action or more dialogue.  Personally I'm happy to watch the scenery and let the movie unfold.  No, it's not that quickly paced, and yes, some things are telegraphed from what seems to be miles away (making things a bit too predictable), but the story was enjoyable enough to make me want to see it again.I must admit, my purchase of the movie was somewhat inspired by Morgan Freeman being in the movie.  Though there are plenty of movies and roles he's been in that I wouldn't go out of my way to see, his role here seemed to fit him nicely and I think he did well with the part he was asked to play.

This is a kind of B action film in which a sniper tries to kill his target, but the target is saved by a pure luck more than once; in which the film's situation is incredibly contrived, but its weak story offers little except clich&eacute;d and uninteresting characters walking and talking.Morgan Freeman is Frank, military-trained assassin in the custody of US marshals. He manages to escape with a help from contract killers, but is then apprehended by Ray, an ex-policeman played by John Cusack. Ray and Ray's son wander in the woods with Frank in handcuffs, trying to contact the police and turn in the hitman while protecting his son, but criminals are hot on the trail of them.The story revolves around the three characters, but it gives no chance to show what these actors can do as it shows little character development. Actions (including shootings, a helicopter and a little bit of car crash) are too bland to interest us. The characters both the good and the bad behave illogically, always doing the last thing they should do and there are plenty of plot holes that would make you feel: ""Why do they have to do this?"" or ""Why don't they just do that?""",2,Two Great Actors in a Very Disappointing Film,1199750400,"01 8, 2008",2008,1436,"['two', 'terrific', 'actors', 'involved', 'Morgan', 'Freeman', 'John', 'Cusack', 'Director', 'twice', 'Oscar-nominated', 'Bruce', 'Beresford', 'Contract', 'opportunity', 'be', 'great', 'thriller', 'moving', 'drama', 'poorly-written', 'script', 'boring', 'action', 'sequences', 'kind', 'B', 'action', 'film', 'sniper', 'kill', 'target', 'target', 'saved', 'pure', 'luck', 'more', 'once', 'film', 'situation', 'incredibly', 'contrived', 'weak', 'story', 'offers', 'little', 'clich', 'eacute', 'd', 'uninteresting', 'characters', 'walking', 'talking.Morgan', 'Freeman', 'Frank', 'military-trained', 'assassin', 'custody', 'US', 'marshals', 'escape', 'help', 'contract', 'killers', 'then', 'apprehended', 'Ray', 'ex-policeman', 'played', 'John', 'Cusack', 'Ray', 'Ray', 'son', 'wander', 'woods', 'Frank', 'handcuffs', 'trying', 'contact', 'police', 'turn', 'hitman', 'protecting', 'son', 'criminals', 'are', 'hot', 'trail', 'them.The', 'story', 'revolves', 'three', 'characters', 'chance', 'show', 'what', 'actors', 'can', 'do', 'little', 'character', 'development', 'Actions', 'including', 'shootings', 'helicopter', 'little', 'bit', 'car', 'crash', 'are', 'too', 'bland', 'interest', 'characters', 'good', 'bad', 'behave', 'illogically', 'always', 'doing', 'last', 'thing', 'should', 'do', 'are', 'plenty', 'plot', 'holes', 'would', 'make', 'feel', 'Why', 'do', 'have', 'do', 'Why', 'do', ""n't"", 'just', 'do']",The Contract
