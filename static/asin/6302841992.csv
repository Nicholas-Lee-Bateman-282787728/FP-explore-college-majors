The way she looks when she's hoping for her miracles to find a new school or for her students to achieve more and do better. I think Ingrid stole the show but that's not to say I underestimate Bing. His face holds a mountain of expressions. He subtly brings the comedy to Ingrid's serious side. My favorite scene is after Eddie clobbers Tommy in their second fight and Sister Benedict says &#8220;Does it really matter- I mean to be.&#8221; The dialog and facial expressions it makes the movie.I don't recall a movie where Bing didn't wear a hat?,5,Tissue and popcorn,1395792000,"03 26, 2014",2014,682,"['always', 'get', 'tissue', 'popcorn', 'cry', 'entire', 'movie', 'everytime', 'watch', 'think', 'Ingrid', 'longing', 'eyes', 'way', 'when', 'hoping', 'miracles', 'find', 'new', 'school', 'students', 'achieve', 'more', 'do', 'better', 'think', 'Ingrid', 'stole', 'show', 'not', 'say', 'underestimate', 'Bing', 'face', 'mountain', 'expressions', 'subtly', 'comedy', 'Ingrid', 'serious', 'side', 'favorite', 'scene', 'Eddie', 'clobbers', 'Tommy', 'second', 'fight', 'Sister', 'Benedict', '8220', 'really', 'matter-', 'mean', 'be.', '8221', 'dialog', 'facial', 'expressions', 'movie.I', 'do', ""n't"", 'recall', 'movie', 'where', 'Bing', 'did', ""n't"", 'wear', 'hat']",N/A

[The lighting tells you this is a stage set.] He meets Sister Superior Benedict and the other nuns of the parish school. Earthly honors and rewards are not for them; they do God&#8217;s work. The children recite the Pledge in the new fashion, hand over heart. The school has no playground; they had to sell it to raise money for repairs to the school. [The Great Depression.] Mr. Bogardus tells Father O&#8217;Malley that he wants their school; if they don&#8217;t sell the Town Council will condemn it (eminent domain or zoning). A woman arranges for her daughter to be boarded at school; she needs special help. A new boy gets into trouble. What is the proper way to handle interpersonal conflicts? The Sisters visit a sporting goods store (remember them?) to gain knowledge on a non-scholastic subject. [Note the firearms on open display.] Father O&#8217;Malley helps a young girl with her homework.Young Patricia&#8217;s essay hints at help from an adult. Young Eddie has profited from his extra-curricular education. The Christmas play put on by first-graders shows elegant simplicity. Mr. Bogardus explains his need for their school property - his workers need parking for their cars (a comment on the return of prosperity). The Sisters tell Mr. Bogardus that they want him to donate his new building to their school! [The war time shortages of materials like glass are referenced.] The stress is harming Mr. Bogardus. A long-lost husband is reunited with his wife, and we hear another song. There is a question of school policy as to passing students who are not academic high performers. What is the purpose of schooling? Isn&#8217;t it a means to an end, not an end in itself?Mr. Bogardus suddenly turns over a new leaf, and donates his building to St. Mary&#8217;s! It&#8217;s a miracle. The doctor has bad news: Sister Benedict has TB in an early stage. [This diagnosis was often a death sentence before the antibiotic cure of the 1950s.] She must be sent away for a rest cure, but she cannot be told why (to keep her spirits up and effect a cure). Patsy meets he reunited parents, and things will be different. Patsy graduates to move on to High School. [In earlier times those who finished Grammar School went to work at age 14; their education continued in the workplace.] Was life really so simple in those times? Ingrid Bergman shows her acting ability as Sister Benedict.I remember another reason to explain Mr. Bogardus&#8217; generosity. His plant was land-locked, even if he got a new parking lot. But if he was able to buy a large property outside of town he would have more than enough space and lower taxes too. No traffic problems either. An elderly widow could no longer work her farm. So Father O&#8217;Malley arranged a deal that was a win for all concerned. The availability of plentiful food has put an end to TB in America. From about 1860 to 1950 it was the major cause of death in America. Did we end up with an epidemic of obesity in turn? Its better to die of a heart attack or diabetes at 60 than of TB at 30.

The story picks up exactly where we left off at the end ofGOING MY WAY(1944), with Father O'Malley's arrival at his new parish. The initial humor, some business with a kitten in O'Malley's hat, vanishes as fast as the cats do.Then we have a boy whose face was pounded by a bully, all for the sake of Mother Sister Benedict's advice to ""turn the other cheek."" The sequence of a guilt-ridden nun trying to teach young Eddie to box plays poorly, like a Mama's boy sparring in the kitchen with mother just before he dries the dishes.The main flaw is, O'Malley, who's just a garrulous regular Joe with a collar, has no real male friends, no monsignor's shared drink from a secret book, no best buddy to shoot a stolen round of golf with. He's reduced to observing the nuns and kids with detached amusement and staying out of the way. Or so it seems to me.The troubled girl with a single mom doesn't work as well as street kids that are organized into a choir in the first film, there's no truly great music to savor, like the Carmen ""Habenera,"" and the pathos of Sister Benedict's TB spot doesn't strike the heart the way old Fitzgibbon's reunion with his doddering mother does.I really wanted to like the movie, too.

Henry Travers who plays  Horace P. Bogardus also played Clarence the angel in the all time favorite Christmas movie It's A Wonderful Life.

I would say that 98% of viewers are going to be delighted with this product. However, for the 2% that are super-critical collectors, this product is not perfect in the way similar vintage film restorations from companies like Criterion are perfect. Although it varies from scene to scene, the print is a bit over-exposed and the focus is often soft (especially noticeable during close-ups). The print is also on the grainy side which is again most obvious during close-ups or if you pause the picture. During the opening credits, and in one or two other scenes, it looks like each side of the screen is being illuminated by some soft ambient light that washes out the picture a bit on those sides. This ambient light is not noticeable on the Republic Pictures DVD.But, as I said, these defects are going to annoy only the super-critical collector. If you like this type of warmhearted, uplifting movie from Hollywood's 'Golden Age' (and I admit that I do), you will be pleased with this new black and white release from Olive Films.(The Blu-ray contains no extras.)",4,Very Good But Not Perfect,1385164800,"11 23, 2013",2013,1383,"['Olive', 'Films', 'Blu-ray', 'Bells', 'St.', 'Mary', 'significant', 'improvement', 'DVD', 'released', 'Republic', 'Pictures', 'years', 'ago', 'print', 'used', 'Blu-ray', 'steady', 'clean', 'clear', 'fact', 'print', 'so', 'free', 'artifacts', 'scratches', 'dirt', 'specks', 'suspect', 'quite', 'bit', 'restoration', 'was', 'done', 'would', 'say', '98', '%', 'viewers', 'are', 'going', 'be', 'delighted', 'product', 'However', '2', '%', 'are', 'super-critical', 'collectors', 'product', 'not', 'perfect', 'way', 'similar', 'vintage', 'film', 'restorations', 'companies', 'Criterion', 'are', 'perfect', 'scene', 'scene', 'print', 'bit', 'over-exposed', 'focus', 'often', 'soft', 'especially', 'noticeable', 'close-ups', 'print', 'also', 'grainy', 'side', 'again', 'most', 'obvious', 'close-ups', 'pause', 'picture', 'opening', 'credits', 'one', 'two', 'other', 'scenes', 'side', 'screen', 'being', 'illuminated', 'soft', 'ambient', 'light', 'out', 'picture', 'bit', 'sides', 'ambient', 'light', 'not', 'noticeable', 'Republic', 'Pictures', 'DVD.But', 'said', 'defects', 'are', 'going', 'annoy', 'only', 'super-critical', 'collector', 'like', 'type', 'warmhearted', 'uplifting', 'movie', 'Hollywood', ""'Golden"", 'Age', 'admit', 'do', 'will', 'be', 'pleased', 'new', 'black', 'white', 'release', 'Olive', 'Films', 'Blu-ray', 'extras']",N/A

The saving grace of the film is the towering performances of Bing Crosby returning as Father O'Malley and Ingrid Bergman as Sister Benedict.  Crosby may even be better than he was in ""Going My Way"" because there are less musical interludes and more opportunities to grapple the drama.  Bergman just shines here.  Her character is simultaneously funny yet tough, ultimately endearing.  It is a credit to the skills of both Crosby and Bergman that they navigate the schmaltzier elements of the film.

Director Leo McCarey has Bing Crosby reprise his role as Father O'Malley from their film from a year earlier, ""Going My Way"". Both really reflect the type of films that would more likely show up as TV movies on the Family Channel if produced today, but wartime audiences were obviously in need of such cinematic salves. What is reassuring is how the films remain affecting today if rather unabashedly sentimental.What sets this one apart is Crosby's natural ease in the role (certainly far more muted than he is with Bob Hope in the Road movies) and having the incandescent Bergman portray Sister Benedict. The pacing is leisurely, as the first part of the film establishes the two stars in their roles before going into the slim plotline, which has the sister hoping a rich curmudgeon named Horace P. Bogardus will donate a new, expansive building to St. Mary's Academy to take place of the rundown old building that the sisters and the schoolchildren inhabit.McCarey - along with screenwriter Dudley Nichols - both pioneers of screwball comedy, focus on the lightheartedness of the story until a couple of sentimental developments occur. The first has to do with a lonely student named Patsy, who comes to idolize Sister Benedict, to the point of intentionally failing to graduate in order to avoid going back home to her concerned mother and estranged father. The second involves Sister Benedict's medical condition which forces Father O'Malley to make a difficult decision about St. Mary's.There are fewer songs here than in ""Going My Way"" - the title tune and another one, ""Aren't You Glad You're You?"", both sung effortlessly by Crosby and a Swedish folk song performed in a warm alto by Bergman. The soft-centered philosophical discussions between the two leads generate some interesting conflict though nothing that feels irreconcilable by the end. There are also some amusing scenes as well, for example, the kindergarten class unaffectedly improvising the Christmas play and Bergman showing off her pugilistic prowess to a boy beaten up in a fight.While I much prefer Bergman in her more outwardly seductive roles (""Notorious""), I can see why people wanted so much to see her as the glowing embodiment of good during WWII, even though it is this image that was the harbinger when she was caught in an extramarital scandal with Roberto Rossellini five years later. Crosby always seems to be playing himself, which in this case, is a good thing. Henry Travers, forever Clarence to me from Frank Capra's ""It's a Wonderful Life"", plays Bogardus with appropriate stubbornness and compromised regret, and Joan Carroll, the least prominent of the Smith daughters in Vincente Minnelli's ""Meet Me in St. Louis"", gives a solid performance as the conflicted Patsy.

It was as great as we remember it was.Bing Crosby is the leading man and parish priest, Father O'Malley assigned to an improverished and delapidated school that is being run by Sister Benedict, played by leading lady, Ingrid Bergman. St. Mary's is a rundown grammar school near and dear to the hearts of the nuns who teach there, especially Sister Mary Benedict. Her prayer for the school's salvation is that a selfish businessman (Harry Travers) will sell the building next door, which she envisions as a school rather than a factory. He envisions a dilapitated St. Mary's as a parking lot for his building. Sister Benedict also has a rather unconvincing clash of wills with Father O'Malley over the development and care of the students, in particular, one failing student from a troubled background named Patsy. Father O'Malley decides to transfer Sister Benedict from the school, but not over the differences, as the good sister thinks.The transfer takes this movie from a delightful fun film with singing interludes by Bing Crosby to emotional, tear-jerk, Oscar-level performances from Bergman and Crosby. Bergman reaches down into her soul to produce emotions that convey disbelief and understanding simultaneously, that convey bitterness and hope. Crosby' face shows the turmoil of telling Sister Benedict the reason for her transfer vs. keeping a dark secret. At this point even the most unemotional soul wlll reach for the Kleenex.Surprisingly neither won the Oscars they were nominated for. (Wow! The winners must have been really good)!

No wonder she turned a million little American boys onto Catholicism and boxing at the same time.  Bing Crosby can't take his eyes off of her, and this gives the movie an interesting tension; to doubters I say that Leo McCarey could have hired any actress to play Sister Benedict--a Helen Hayes, an Ethel Barrymore.  Or younger, it could have been Rosalind Russell.  But instead McCarey just happened to hire the sexiest, most beautiful actress in the movies!  You know he wanted those sparks.  The two stars are said to have conducted a romance whenever they heard the word ""cut.""  Who could blame them?  McCarey's sets were generally easy-going affairs, with great catering and plenty of cocktails served twice a day.  This was the last of Crosby's four 1945 pictures.  They kept them busy in those days!  (Besides which, of course, he was starring the whole time in his own Philco-sponsored radio program every week.)  THE BELLS OF ST MARY'S was a step up in quality from his other 1945 efforts (except for THE ROAD TO UTOPIA, which has its own surrealist charm and serious fanbase).  Bergman was similarly overworked, having just released SPELLBOUND as well as SARATOGA TRUNK (filmed earlier and delayed due to glut of studio releases during the war years).  She was at the height of her beauty and fame, and it seemed she could do no wrong.  The confidence of her portrayal of Sister Benedict underlines this.The movie, a sequel to GOING MY WAY, lit up the box office and became the biggest hit of the year.  However, Crosby felt he had gone to the well enough and declined to star in a third installment which would have matched Father O'Malley with an orphaned set of twins (his niece and nephew).  Even in the 1950s when he could have used a hit, he told his manager he would never make a third O'Malley film.Late in her life I asked Ingrid Bergman which was her favorite movie of all those she had made.  She laughed.  In Sweden?  She named a film I did not recognize its title.  With Rossellini?  She said ""Europa 51.""  In America?

But I have always felt that the sequel &quot;The Bells of St. Mary's&quot; is the better of the two movies.For one thing, it is a lot more plausible. In the first film, it turns out Father O'Malley's old girlfriend is a famous diva at the Met Opera and he himself publishes a hit song--a little out of the ordinary, you might say. But &quot;Bells&quot; concerns itself with just events within the parish; these things could happen in your own community, to people you know without stretching your imagination too much.And of course, the big advantage to &quot;Bells&quot; is the beguiling Ingrid Bergman as Sister Benedict, principal of St. Mary's School. Bergman was an asset to every film featuring her, with her radiant smile and charming manner. Here, she must learn how to deal with Bing's Father O'Malley, the new pastor who controls the pursestrings to her school. Their relationship develops well over the course of the picture, and the viewer may think to himself that in another set of circumstances these two would have made a good couple. However, as it is, theirs is a good platonic friendship between sister and priest without a breath of scandal. Yet there are problems to be overcome, because the relationship is not ultimately equal after all: the pastor has the final authority, and the sister must kowtow to him. There are several instances of this in the movie, and towards the end, the most serious one (which I'll not impart here for the sake of those who haven't viewed the movie) nearly ruptures their friendship for good when Father O'Malley does not tell Sister Benedict the Real Reason for his extreme action.&quot;The Bells of St. Mary's&quot; is a great Christmas movie, but you don't have to wait until then to see this heartwarming film.",4,A Sequel Better than the Original,996796800,"08 3, 2001",2001,1897,"['quot', 'Going', 'My', 'Way', 'quot', 'won', 'Oscars', 'Bing', 'Crosby', 'Barry', 'Fitzgerald', 'still', 'pretty', 'good', 'movie', 'today', 'standards', 'have', 'always', 'felt', 'sequel', 'quot', 'Bells', 'St.', 'Mary', 'quot', 'better', 'two', 'movies.For', 'one', 'thing', 'lot', 'more', 'plausible', 'first', 'film', 'out', 'Father', ""O'Malley"", 'old', 'girlfriend', 'famous', 'diva', 'Met', 'Opera', 'hit', 'song', 'little', 'ordinary', 'might', 'say', 'quot', 'Bells', 'quot', 'concerns', 'just', 'events', 'parish', 'things', 'could', 'happen', 'own', 'community', 'people', 'know', 'stretching', 'imagination', 'too', 'much.And', 'course', 'big', 'advantage', 'quot', 'Bells', 'quot', 'beguiling', 'Ingrid', 'Bergman', 'Sister', 'Benedict', 'principal', 'St.', 'Mary', 'School', 'Bergman', 'was', 'asset', 'film', 'featuring', 'radiant', 'smile', 'charming', 'manner', 'Here', 'must', 'learn', 'how', 'deal', 'Bing', 'Father', ""O'Malley"", 'new', 'pastor', 'who', 'pursestrings', 'school', 'relationship', 'well', 'course', 'picture', 'viewer', 'may', 'think', 'set', 'circumstances', 'two', 'would', 'have', 'made', 'good', 'couple', 'However', 'good', 'platonic', 'friendship', 'sister', 'priest', 'breath', 'scandal', 'are', 'problems', 'be', 'overcome', 'relationship', 'not', 'ultimately', 'equal', 'pastor', 'final', 'authority', 'sister', 'must', 'kowtow', 'are', 'several', 'instances', 'movie', 'end', 'most', 'serious', 'one', ""'ll"", 'not', 'impart', 'here', 'sake', 'who', 'have', ""n't"", 'viewed', 'movie', 'nearly', 'friendship', 'good', 'when', 'Father', ""O'Malley"", 'not', 'tell', 'Sister', 'Benedict', 'Real', 'Reason', 'extreme', 'action.', 'quot', 'Bells', 'St.', 'Mary', 'quot', 'great', 'Christmas', 'movie', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'wait', 'then', 'see', 'heartwarming', 'film']",N/A

Crosby is Father O'Malley who is the new pastor assigned to help the financially troubled St. Mary's. Bergman is Sister Benedict who runs the school. She has great faith that all of their problems will be resolved by praying and O'Malley sees the solutions from a more worldly view. They immediately clash when O'Malley gives the students a holiday his first day on the job, much to Bergman's frustration. That is only the beginning of their differences. In addition to their philosophical differences, they both live under the tension of financial pressure that may force them to sell the school. They had already sold their playground to raise money to repair the ancient building. Will the school survive and will they survive each other? Will faith and prayer carry the day or will it be up to O'Malley to work a more practical solution? A wonderful story and, of course, a few songs thrown in.

The school has no money and O'Malley's job is to assess the possibilites, of perhaps sending the children to another school.He meets with some tough oppostion though, in the form of one Sister Benedict(Ingrid Bergman). She is the no nonsense type,and right away the two have some very different ideas on what's good for the kids.There is also the problem of a businesman(Henry Travers) who wants the building condemned so he can put up a parking lot for his own employees.Sister Benedict prays for miracle, will she get it?The story and Ingrid Bergman are charming and delightful and will have you praying with her for that miracle.Bing's beautiful voice graces the film with song and Henry Travers(It's A Wonderful Life) is wonderful as always. It's not too often a sequel equals the original, but with the addition of Bergman,  (along with some really adorable kids)and under the direction of Leo McCarey once again, this heartwarming story has accomplished that.This Silver Screens Classic DVD has done a really nice job with the remastering of this Black and White Classic.The film made in 1945 barely shows it's age. It is a nice clear picture, and the Dolby Digital Sound is good as well. It contains the original Theatrical Trailer, Has French and Spanish language tracks as well as subtitles, and has captioning in English.It also comes with a little brochure with some facts about the filming.If your looking for some great old classics that look great on DVD to add to your collection, this would be a good one.Happy Viewing......Laurie",5,"Bing's Tones, Ingrid's Charms,Remastered on DVD....Heavenly!",1040256000,"12 19, 2002",2002,1914,"['review', 'Silver', 'Screen', 'Classics', 'Edition', 'Republic', 'Pictures', 'DVD', '.A', 'beautiful', 'sequel', 'quot', 'Going', 'My', 'Way', 'quot', 'now', 'beautifully', 'transfered', 'DVD', 'quot', 'Bells', 'St.Mary', 'quot', 'funny', 'poignant', 'will', 'tug', 'heartstrings.Father', ""O'Malley"", 'Bing', 'Crosby', 'now', 'been', 'assigned', 'parochial', 'school', 'dire', 'need', 'repairs', 'school', 'money', ""O'Malley"", 'job', 'assess', 'possibilites', 'perhaps', 'sending', 'children', 'school.He', 'meets', 'tough', 'oppostion', 'form', 'one', 'Sister', 'Benedict', 'Ingrid', 'Bergman', 'nonsense', 'type', 'right', 'away', 'two', 'have', 'very', 'different', 'ideas', 'what', 'good', 'kids.There', 'also', 'problem', 'businesman', 'Henry', 'Travers', 'who', 'building', 'condemned', 'so', 'can', 'put', 'up', 'parking', 'lot', 'own', 'employees.Sister', 'Benedict', 'miracle', 'will', 'get', 'story', 'Ingrid', 'Bergman', 'are', 'charming', 'delightful', 'will', 'have', 'praying', 'miracle.Bing', 'beautiful', 'voice', 'graces', 'film', 'song', 'Henry', 'Travers', 'Wonderful', 'Life', 'wonderful', 'always', 'not', 'too', 'often', 'sequel', 'original', 'addition', 'Bergman', 'really', 'adorable', 'kids', 'direction', 'Leo', 'McCarey', 'once', 'again', 'heartwarming', 'story', 'accomplished', 'that.This', 'Silver', 'Screens', 'Classic', 'DVD', 'done', 'really', 'nice', 'job', 'remastering', 'Black', 'White', 'Classic.The', 'film', 'made', '1945', 'barely', 'age', 'nice', 'clear', 'picture', 'Dolby', 'Digital', 'Sound', 'good', 'as', 'well', 'original', 'Theatrical', 'Trailer', 'Has', 'French', 'Spanish', 'language', 'tracks', 'as', 'well', 'subtitles', 'captioning', 'English.It', 'also', 'little', 'brochure', 'facts', 'filming.If', 'looking', 'great', 'old', 'classics', 'look', 'great', 'DVD', 'add', 'collection', 'would', 'be', 'good', 'one.Happy', 'Viewing', 'Laurie']",N/A

Each detail in a major movie is carefully tailored to enhance the film, and since this movie was filmed in black &amp; white, the photography and cinematography was based on that.  If it had been made as a Technicolor movie, the use of color would have become a factor and would have been done as skillfully as the technical skills of the time would permit.  However, when a movie is colorized, the technicians just don't seem to be in tune with the original creators, and the color hardly ever seems right in a colorized film.Leo McCarey had a style and a gentle humor of his own which was a trademark, and it certainly shows here.  He created a movie which has humorous scenes, has sentimentality, and makes a statement.  St. Mary's is presented as an important force in the community. It's being torn down and replaced by a parking lotwould be a significant loss.  Henry Travers as the hard nosed businessman puts his personal financial interests ahead of needs of the community.  At the same time, you have the conflict between the new priest and the nun, a conflict between tradition and discipline contrasted to compassion and spiritual love.Awareness of the present problems and challenges facing the Catholic Church might keep a viewer from completely appreciating what the movie is saying.

I picked up a copy of the DVD this past holiday season. I've seen the movie complete a number of times and never tire of watching it. This is the epitome of 40's motion picture entertainment.An excellent cast turn in equally excellent performances. Bing Crosby is Father O'Malley. Crosby is the only actor ever to have been nominated for a Best Actor Oscar twice for the same role, having also played Father O'Malley in GOING MY WAY the previous year. Ingrid Bergman plays Sister Benedict, the Sister Superior of St. Mary's.  Henry Travers plays Mr. Horace P. Bogardus... you will recognize him as Clarence from IT'S A WONDERFUL LIFE.The film earned eight Oscar nominations in the following categories: Best Actor (Crosby); Best Acress (Bergman); Direction (Leo McCarey); Editing; Score of a dramatic/comedy picture (Robert Emmett Dolan); Song (Aren't You Glad You're You); Sound Recording; Best Picture.BELLS won for Sound Recording.It's a shame BELLS didn't walk away with more Oscars, this truly is a beautiful film and is necessary in any collection. Good for watching anytime, especailly when your spirit needs a lift.The DVD transfer is outstanding. Picture is (generally) stable and clear throughout. Sound is crisp, with little distortion whatsoever. There is a theatrical trailer included, but no other extras. My only complaint about the DVD transfer... what is up with the gray bar at the bottom of the screen that appears at about the 2nd or 3rd page of the Main Title?

The magic they can make.

It's like wanting to settle in on a cold winter's night with a good, steaming cup of hot chocolate; if the chocolate's only warm-- tepid at best-- you're left with a promise of what could have been, unfulfilled.The story is fairly uncomplicated:  St. Mary's school is in trouble; it's old and facing condemnation, and they haven't the money nor the resources to fix it.  There is, however, a new building being constructed on land adjacent to that of St. Mary's, a building that would be perfect for a new school.  And it's the hope of Sister Benedict (Ingrid Bergman), the nun who runs the school, that by some miracle Mr. Horace P. Bogardus (Henry Travers), owner of the new building, will see fit to donate it to St. Mary's.  Toward that end, she has been praying fervently.  She has not, however, contacted Mr. Bogardus, who happens to want St. Mary's so that he can raze the school and put in a parking lot.  Enter Father Chuck O'Malley (Bing Crosby), who has been sent to St. Mary's to weigh the situation and ascertain whether or not it is feasible to keep the school afloat (a fact he does not share with Sister Benedict).  As it is, once he sees the condition of the school itself, it's going to be a tough sell to keep it open.  It just may take that miracle Sister Benedict is praying for.A sequel to the Oscar winner for Best Picture of 1944, ""Going My Way,"" (for which Crosby earned the Oscar for Best Actor; McCarey for Director, as well as writer for Original Story), this one was greeted with some extremely high expectations.  And while McCarey was obviously trying his best to recapture that same spirit that made the first one so engaging, he never quite seems to be able to ignite that same spark.  For one thing, he doesn't have Barry Fitzgerald this time around.  Ingrid Bergman takes on the role of Father O'Malley's sparring partner-- which is another part of the problem.  Their conflict is simply not that pronounced, coming down to a slightly different philosophy as to how to run the school and how strict the guidelines should be for the students.  It just seems rather insignificant in the grand scheme of things; if even half the problems we face in life were thus, we would call this place in which we live Paradise.There's a touch of melodrama to the story, but mostly it's just mellow drama.  Even at it's darkest point, the situation at St. Mary's still seems comparatively like a lazy day at the park.  And it's the result of McCarey's moderation-in-all-things approach.  He tries to convey how bad the situation is without wanting to make it ""too"" bad.  The only real spunk in the film comes during a scene in which Sister Benedict gives a boxing lesson to a student named Eddie (Richard Tyler), who turns out to have a mean right hook in him.  There's also a scene near the beginning in which Father O'Malley introduces himself to the nuns that is mildly amusing.  Other than these, the magic lays fairly dormant throughout.Crosby picks up the character of Father O'Malley without missing a beat, but in doing so he gives new definition to the phrase, ""Laid back.""  A real pipe-and-slipper part, Bing makes the good Father believable, but so easy going that his main purpose seems to be facilitating the progress of the story.  He does manage to work in a couple of songs (Aren't You Glad You're You"" and ""The Bells of St. Mary's""), but his easy manner and McCarey's diluted approach to the material make this a less than absorbing experience.Ingrid Bergman does a good job of bringing Sister Benedict to life (did she ever give a ""bad"" performance in anything?), but she has a hard time breaking free of the stereotypical mold of the nun in which McCarey seems bent on placing her, especially when attempting to exploit her natural beauty by setting her up in a number of ""frieze"" type shots, seemingly meant to establish her purity in all things.  Not a bad ploy, perhaps, but less than effective; consider, for example, how much more of an impact Lilia Skala's nun in ""Lilies of the Field"" had.  Still, capturing Bergman's classic beauty in these shots does provide for some reflective moments, even if it compromises the drama somewhat.  Depth of character, it seems, was not what McCarey was striving for here, and unfortunately his methods give something of a superficial sheen to the film.The supporting cast includes William Gargan (Patsy's Father), Martha Sleeper (Mrs. Gallagher), Joan Carroll (Patsy), Ruth Donnelly (Sister Michael), Rhys Williams (Dr. McKay) and the always delightful Una O'Connor (Mrs. Breen).  A pleasant enough movie, but less than involving, ""The Bells of St. Mary's"" will be a satisfying experience for those of moderate tastes, but for those seeking the kind of drama to which they can really connect, it will be less than fulfilling.  Overall, coming on the heels of ""Going My Way"" and with stars like Crosby and Bergman on hand, it makes a promise to which it never quite lives up.",3,Simply Not &quot;Going My

Although I was born after the decade in which this iconic film is set, I do have vague childhood recollections of nuns in full habit staffing our local parish grammar school at the outset of my non-voluntary consignment to the educational ministrations of the good Sisters of Saint Joseph [CSJ].

Most of all, this low-key and well-acted film classic is a delightful piece of nostalgic escapism with mega-stars of the black& white picture screen era.The Bells of St. Mary's DVD also highlights a shared value system and a pace of life that rightly had its allure--a welcome contrast with today's digital society living in the moment [or even sooner], where most anything goes while integrity, respect, and religious influence are ebbing.

This is a set that you would be proud to give as a gift as it is beautifully presented.This version is from the 1945 black and white dvd.  It is a great improvement over the 1945 black and white dvd.  However, it has not been remastered so it still has a softer focus than some of the blu-rays transfers.

340233,A2TOU0N8XE68W4,6302841992,Simon Davis,"[15, 16]","What can I say about this classic film other than that it captures perfectly two of Hollywood's most beloved performers in Bing Crosby and Ingrid Bergman at the peak of their careers in roles with which they would be forever cherished for. The phrase ""they dont make them like this anymore"", I feel definately applies to this charming little movie which was a sequel to Bing Crosby's Academy Award Winning role in the previous years classic ""Going My Way"". Playing the ever resourceful singing Father O'Malley Bing Crosby created the type of character for which he would be always identified with. The great Ingrid Bergman fought long and hard to obtain the plum role of Sister Benedict despite the reluctance of David O. Selznick to loan her for a role which he felt would only require her to sit and listen to Bing Crosby sing. Ingrid apparently said that she would love to be able to do just that and turned in one of her most famous performances as the sensible head nun of St. Mary's School who engages in an affectionate rivalry over the future of the school when Father O'Malley is assigned there to sort out the school's many problems. The two leads deliver first rate performances in the rather leisurely story and with ""The Bells of St. Mary's"", Ingrid Bergman especially became almost the benchmark for how nuns were to be portrayed in Hollywood for the next 30 years.We first see Father O'Malley arriving at St. Mary's school in his new appointment where he is to be responsible for looking into the future of the present establishment which from lack of funds is operating in a very run down building and has already been forced to sell off most of the children's playing area to developer Horace P. Bogardus (Henry Travers). He is building a new factory on the site and hopes to buy the rest of the school as well. St. Mary's is run by Sister Benedict(Ingrid Bergman), a nun who believes in the power of prayer to obtain what is needed in life. With Father O'Malley's more practical everyday philosophy on life the two soon become engaged in a battle of wills over what future St. Mary's has. Sister Benedict strongly believes that Mr. Bogardus will eventually donate his nearly completed building to the school whereas Father O'Malley sees the logic of selling off the remaining school grounds. As time goes by a number of people and incidents occur to colour the life of St. Mary's and which allow both Father O'Malley and Sister Benedict to learn more about each others qualities that increase the at times reluctant respect they have for each other.  Father O'Malley takes responsibility for the education of a young girl Patsy (Joan Carroll), who is left at the school and who doesn't know who her father is, and he sets out to reunite her shattered family. Meanwhile Sister Benedict takes young student Eddie (Richard Tyler), under her wing and actually teaches him boxing in order for him to be able to defend himself against some playground bullies. Despite the seemingly ongoing hopeless situation St. Mary's is in Sister Benedict's unswerving belief in a miracle occuring finally does happen when through a health scare Mr. Bogardus realises the need to do something for others in order to be liked by people and with some not so gently ""persuasion"", by Sister Benedict and the other nuns he finally donates the new building to the school and thus St. Mary's is saved from closing. However Sister Benedict's trials are not yet over when her own health begins to fail from over work and it is discovered she is suffering from the early stages of TB. Father O'Malley with his growing respect for the Sister then faces the difficult task of relieving her of her duties at her beloved St. Mary's so that she can recover in a warmer climate from her ailment. At first depressed about being sent away and not informed of her illness Sister Bendict prays hard to find forgiveness in her heart for Father O""Malley's seemingly harsh actions. Only when she is finally saying her goodbyes to the Sisters does Father O""Malley break down and tell her the real reason why she is being sent away and the rift between then instantly disappears. To an obviously relived Sister Father O'Malley then delivers his famous line that if She ever needs anything at all all she needs to do is ""Dial ""O"" for O'Malley"".As beautiful and heartfelt story as you would find anywhere ""The Bells of St. Mary's"", is a class act from start to finish and while perhaps not as famous as its illustrious ""parent"", ""Going My Way"", it has much that is worthwhile. The once off teaming of Bing Crosby and Ingrid Bergman created great chemistry on screen and they are both incredibly believable in their performances. The film contains a number of truly delightful little scenes that really help humanise the characters such as when Father O'Malley has to content with a kitten playing in his hat while he is giving his welcome speech to the very amused nuns, and especially when Sister Benedict teaches Eddie to box and ""coaches"", him from the window during a school yard fight. Both performers are perfect here and in the sadder moments such as when Sister Benedict is told she is being sent away these two really show their acting strengths in a scene that could have been simply sentimental with little depth to it but which is turned into a remarkable scene that shows that clergy are people just like everyone else full of many different emotions. Veteran character actor Henry Travers who was so wonderful in countless classic over this decade such as ""Mrs. Miniver"", delivers another fine performance here as the grumpy Mr. Bogardus who eventually sees the value in living life in the service of others. His scenes with Ingrid Bergman in particular recall his great work opposite that other popular 40's actress Greer Garson in ""Mrs. Miniver"", and is beautifully multilayered for what could have been just your standard mean old man.  Produced and directed by Leo McCarey he leads the film in an at times slow and leisurely pace however that suits the subject matter here as it slowly traces the growing respect that develops between the two sometime rivals Father O'Malley and Sister Benedict. Nominated for 8 Academy Awards including Best Picture, Best Actor and Best Actress, the film shows off its expertise in all areas and while at times of course idealised it is a good illustration of much of the largely unacknowledged work carried in schools by the clergy over the decades.""The Bells of St. Mary's"", may appear on the sentimental side to modern movie watches but I appreciate it for the truly great performances by the two leads in their prime and for the sensitive treatment it takes in depicting one woman's great belief in the basic good of others and their ability to do the right thing by their fellow man. For a look into how Hollywood once depicted the varied work of nuns and priests in a dignified manner while still showing them as human beings with feelings, ""The Bells of St. Mary's"", is unrivalled and is highly recommended viewing.

340236,AT07UZQQR7ZEH,6302841992,"Stephen H. Wood ""Film scholar and vintage mov...","[3, 4]","(REVIEWED FROM REMASTERED B&W; VIDEOCASSETTE)Leo McCarey's THE BELLS OF ST. MARY'S (1945) is a one year later sequel to his Oscar-winning GOING MY WAY (1944).  This time Billy Wilder's towering THE LOST WEEKEND swept the major Oscars, but BELLS still got seven nominations, including Picture, Director, Actor, and Actress.  This time we are at St. Mary's with Bing Crosby's likeable and youthful Father O'Malley interacting with Ingrid Bergman's conservative and rather stern Sister Benedict.Like GOING MY WAY, Dudley Nichols' superb original screenplay hinges on plot strands that interweave to a certain degree.  A sweet kid who keeps getting beaten up actually takes boxing lessons from Sister Eenedict and beats up the bully, who becomes his friend in the sentimental world of McCarey and Nichols.  Meanwhile, the first grade puts on an exquisite Christmas Nativity pageant for Sister Benedict and Father O'Malley than reminded me of my own first grade nephew Caleb.Then there is the troubled eighth grader Patsy, who is in danger of not passing with the rest of her class.  There are hints that she fails on purpose to get attention, but an essay she writes on ""the six senses"" is excellent.  I don't know who plays Patsy, but she is superb and this plot strand is very poignant.Most of all, we have Henry Travers' Horace Bogardus going crazy trying to ""play ball"" with the nuns over the church property.  He wants to tear down St. Mary's and create a parking lot for his new building, which is going up where the sisters' parking lot used to be.  I think Bogardus has created a new church across town for the sisters and has St. Mary's condemned, which sounds more than acceptable to me.  But it is unacceptable in the sentimental world of Leo McCarey, whose career goes back to Laurel and Hardy silents in the 1920's.  The sisters twist Bogardus' deal around so that he ends up doing...well, that would spoil the movie to tell you here, but it is very satisfying.  Travers got a 1946 Oscar nomination as Angel Clarence in IT'S A WONDERFUL LIFE.  He deserved another one in BELLS.  It is a treat seeing him play a Scrooge-like businessman villain.  (Trivia note:  In the last ten minutes of LIFE, the movie theater that George Bailey runs past is playing THE BELLS OF ST. MARY'S.)THE BELLS OF ST. MARY'S, which also runs 126 minutes, has a much darker and less schmaltzy ending than GOING MY WAY.  Will Patsy graduate?  Will the sisters get to keep St. Mary's?  What happens to Mr. Bogardus and his new building?  And what is the ultimate fate of Sister Benedict when the doctor does NOT tell her that she has a touch of tuberculosis?  (But he confides in Father O'Malley.)  I like BELLS more than GOING actually, but both are very good pieces of honest, heartwarming sentiment that are both highly recommended if that is what you are in the mood for.",4,A Bing Crosby musical favorite of mine,1142640000,"03 18, 2006",2006,2857,"['FROM', 'REMASTERED', 'B', 'W', 'VIDEOCASSETTE', 'Leo', 'McCarey', 'THE', 'BELLS', 'OF', 'ST.', 'MARY', '1945', 'one', 'year', 'later', 'sequel', 'Oscar-winning', 'GOING', 'MY', 'WAY', '1944', 'time', 'Billy', 'Wilder', 'towering', 'THE', 'LOST', 'WEEKEND', 'swept', 'major', 'Oscars', 'BELLS', 'still', 'got', 'seven', 'nominations', 'including', 'Picture', 'Director', 'Actor', 'Actress', 'time', 'are', 'St.', 'Mary', 'Bing', 'Crosby', 'likeable', 'youthful', 'Father', ""O'Malley"", 'interacting', 'Ingrid', 'Bergman', 'conservative', 'rather', 'stern', 'Sister', 'Benedict.Like', 'GOING', 'MY', 'WAY', 'Dudley', 'Nichols', 'superb', 'original', 'screenplay', 'hinges', 'plot', 'strands', 'interweave', 'certain', 'degree', 'sweet', 'kid', 'who', 'getting', 'beaten', 'up', 'actually', 'boxing', 'lessons', 'Sister', 'Eenedict', 'up', 'bully', 'who', 'friend', 'sentimental', 'world', 'McCarey', 'Nichols', 'Meanwhile', 'first', 'grade', 'exquisite', 'Christmas', 'Nativity', 'pageant', 'Sister', 'Benedict', 'Father', ""O'Malley"", 'reminded', 'own', 'first', 'grade', 'nephew', 'Caleb.Then', 'troubled', 'eighth', 'grader', 'Patsy', 'who', 'danger', 'not', 'passing', 'rest', 'class', 'are', 'hints', 'purpose', 'get', 'attention', 'essay', 'six', 'senses', 'excellent', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'who', 'Patsy', 'superb', 'plot', 'strand', 'very', 'poignant.Most', 'have', 'Henry', 'Travers', 'Horace', 'Bogardus', 'going', 'crazy', 'trying', 'play', 'ball', 'nuns', 'church', 'property', 'tear', 'down', 'St.', 'Mary', 'create', 'parking', 'lot', 'new', 'building', 'going', 'up', 'where', 'sisters', 'parking', 'lot', 'used', 'be', 'think', 'Bogardus', 'created', 'new', 'church', 'town', 'sisters', 'St.', 'Mary', 'condemned', 'more', 'acceptable', 'unacceptable', 'sentimental', 'world', 'Leo', 'McCarey', 'career', 'back', 'Laurel', 'Hardy', 'silents', '1920', 'sisters', 'twist', 'Bogardus', 'deal', 'so', 'up', 'doing', 'well', 'would', 'spoil', 'movie', 'tell', 'here', 'very', 'satisfying', 'Travers', 'got', '1946', 'Oscar', 'nomination', 'Angel', 'Clarence', 'IT', 'A', 'WONDERFUL', 'LIFE', 'deserved', 'one', 'BELLS', 'treat', 'seeing', 'play', 'Scrooge-like', 'businessman', 'villain', 'Trivia', 'note', 'last', 'ten', 'minutes', 'LIFE', 'movie', 'theater', 'George', 'Bailey', 'past', 'playing', 'THE', 'BELLS', 'OF', 'ST', 'MARY', 'BELLS', 'OF', 'ST.', 'MARY', 'also', '126', 'minutes', 'much', 'darker', 'less', 'schmaltzy', 'ending', 'GOING', 'MY', 'WAY', 'Will', 'Patsy', 'graduate', 'Will', 'sisters', 'get', 'keep', 'St.', 'Mary', 'What', 'Mr.', 'Bogardus', 'new', 'building', 'what', 'ultimate', 'fate', 'Sister', 'Benedict', 'when', 'doctor', 'NOT', 'tell', 'touch', 'tuberculosis', 'Father', ""O'Malley"", 'like', 'BELLS', 'more', 'GOING', 'actually', 'are', 'very', 'good', 'pieces', 'honest', 'heartwarming', 'sentiment', 'are', 'highly', 'recommended', 'what', 'are', 'mood']",N/A

Both star Bing Crosby in one of his signature roles, Father Chuck O'Malley.  In this aimless charmer, Father O'Malley replaces an ailing priest at St. Mary's school, where he has to contend with a batch of nuns lead by Sister Benedict (Ingrid Bergman).  Sister Benedict is supposedly one tough cookie and a stickler for the rules, but we soon see that she's a softie, and Father O'Malley's light touch brings out even more of her humanity.  They make a great pair, and all seems well at St. Mary's.  The children put on adorable plays they wrote themselves, and the worst problem facing the school is a bully who is easily dispatched when Sister Benedict teaches one of her pupils to box.  Well, there is one other problem - the school is decaying and they desperately need a new building.  So Sister Benedict turns to the miserly Horace P. Bogardus (Henry Travers) who has just built a beautiful new facility across the street.  Will she be able to convince him to help St. Mary's?The plot of ""The Bells of St. Mary's"" is rather meandering and unfocused.  Clearly, the movie exists primarily as a vehicle for Bing and Bergman, and they are very good together.  Bergman's beauty shines through her nun's habit, and Bing gets to sing a few songs, including the Oscar nominated ""Aren't You Glad You're You?""  Predictably, the pairing was a major box office draw, and ""The Bells of St. Mary's"" grossed over $21 million dollars, making it one of the biggest hits of the 1940s.Director Leo McCarey also helmed ""Going My Way,"" and he certainly knew how to get laughs and tears from his audience (he would later direct the weeper, ""An Affair to Remember"").  He covered up the plot holes and meandering script with serious levels of cuteness and warmth.  Indeed, even though the film is not explicitly about Christmas, it makes for a terrific holiday movie because of its warm tone.

Irish Catholic McCarey was impressed by letters he received from movie fans who enjoyed ""Going My Way"" and suggested that he do a similar film showcasing the role that nuns played in the Catholic world inhabited by Father O'Malley.Bing Crosby had garnered a Best Actor Oscar for ""Going My Way"" and McCarey secured the services of the beautiful Ingrid Bergman to play Sister Benedict, the Mother Superior of St. Mary's School.  Crosby found himself immediately clashing with Bergman on certain points relating to the parish, but through it all a mutual respect existed between them.  Each realized that the other was committed to the best interests of St. Mary's.Dudley Nichols, a Best Original Screenplay Academy Award winner a decade earlier for the John Ford film about the Irish political conflict starring Victor McLaglen, ""The Informer"", directed his effort in the script toward presenting Crosby and Bergman in periodic conflict, but learning from those experiences.  Much of the contrast, they realize, stems from the way that men and women view situations.  One phase of the film showing this difference is when Bergman teaches a young student who has been victimized by a bully how to box as a means of restoring order.  She feels a tinge of guilt since the youngster's failure to fight back and receipt of a beating in the process stemmed from his obedience to her stricture against fighting at St. Mary's.When Crosby pursues a conventional macho posture in extolling the need for protecting oneself and praises the fighting skills of the bully, the nun has had enough.  She purchases a boxing instructional book written by former heavyweight champion Gene Tunney and adeptly instructs the obedient youngster in the manly art of self-defense as he ultimately teaches the bully a lesson.  Crosby recognizes her teaching skill and becomes cognizant of the strength of her feminine viewpoint.An area where Crosby and Bergman cooperate is in seeking the answer to the nun's fervent prayer.  She believes that of the mortgage holder of their property, Henry Travers, who has built a modern building next door and seeks to use the church property for an employee parking lot, may through prayer and proper persuasion be convinced to give them his modern structure.  The result would be a new school and no further need to use the tired current facility.The effectiveness of Crosby and Bergman stems from their soft sell technique with just the right pinch of Christian charitable thought thrown into the mix.  Travers, who cannot sleep nights and experiences heart problems, confides to the priest and nun separately that he wishes he was better liked.Their soft sell approach in advancing the ""It is more blessed to give than to receive"" precept along with the accompanying feel good element of charity prompts Travers to see things in a light more favorable to the interests of St. Mary's.Crosby and Bergman are delights to behold in this feel good film.  They provide challenges to each other through disagreement and an effective front when they team up on the issue of greatest importance to them, the welfare of St. Mary's parish.",5,A Feel Good Film With Interesting Psychological Conflict,1115078400,"05 3, 2005",2005,3473,"['Bells', 'St.', 'Mary', 'was', 'shrewd', 'move', 'Paramount', 'Studios', 'director', 'Leo', 'McCarey', 'successful', 'prequel', 'film', 'likable', 'practical', 'Catholic', 'priest', 'Father', ""O'Malley"", 'Going', 'Way', 'spawned', '1945', 'release', 'included', 'additional', 'element', 'provided', 'basis', 'interesting', 'psychological', 'conflict', 'Irish', 'Catholic', 'McCarey', 'was', 'impressed', 'letters', 'received', 'movie', 'fans', 'who', 'enjoyed', 'Going', 'Way', 'suggested', 'do', 'similar', 'film', 'showcasing', 'role', 'played', 'Catholic', 'world', 'inhabited', 'Father', ""O'Malley.Bing"", 'Crosby', 'had', 'garnered', 'Best', 'Actor', 'Oscar', 'Going', 'Way', 'McCarey', 'secured', 'services', 'beautiful', 'Ingrid', 'Bergman', 'play', 'Sister', 'Benedict', 'Mother', 'Superior', 'St.', 'Mary', 'School', 'Crosby', 'found', 'immediately', 'clashing', 'Bergman', 'certain', 'points', 'relating', 'parish', 'mutual', 'respect', 'existed', 'realized', 'other', 'was', 'committed', 'best', 'interests', 'St.', ""Mary's.Dudley"", 'Nichols', 'Best', 'Original', 'Screenplay', 'Academy', 'Award', 'winner', 'decade', 'earlier', 'John', 'Ford', 'film', 'Irish', 'political', 'conflict', 'starring', 'Victor', 'McLaglen', 'Informer', 'directed', 'effort', 'script', 'presenting', 'Crosby', 'Bergman', 'periodic', 'conflict', 'learning', 'experiences', 'Much', 'contrast', 'realize', 'way', 'men', 'women', 'view', 'situations', 'One', 'phase', 'film', 'showing', 'difference', 'when', 'Bergman', 'young', 'student', 'who', 'been', 'victimized', 'bully', 'how', 'box', 'means', 'restoring', 'order', 'tinge', 'guilt', 'youngster', 'failure', 'fight', 'back', 'receipt', 'beating', 'process', 'stemmed', 'obedience', 'stricture', 'fighting', 'St.', ""Mary's.When"", 'Crosby', 'conventional', 'macho', 'posture', 'extolling', 'need', 'protecting', 'fighting', 'skills', 'bully', 'nun', 'had', 'enough', 'purchases', 'boxing', 'instructional', 'book', 'written', 'former', 'heavyweight', 'champion', 'Gene', 'Tunney', 'adeptly', 'obedient', 'youngster', 'manly', 'art', 'self-defense', 'ultimately', 'bully', 'lesson', 'Crosby', 'teaching', 'skill', 'cognizant', 'strength', 'feminine', 'viewpoint.An', 'area', 'where', 'Crosby', 'Bergman', 'cooperate', 'seeking', 'answer', 'nun', 'fervent', 'prayer', 'mortgage', 'holder', 'property', 'Henry', 'Travers', 'who', 'built', 'modern', 'building', 'next', 'door', 'seeks', 'use', 'church', 'property', 'employee', 'parking', 'lot', 'may', 'prayer', 'proper', 'persuasion', 'be', 'convinced', 'give', 'modern', 'structure', 'result', 'would', 'be', 'new', 'school', 'further', 'need', 'use', 'tired', 'current', 'facility.The', 'effectiveness', 'Crosby', 'Bergman', 'soft', 'sell', 'technique', 'just', 'right', 'pinch', 'Christian', 'charitable', 'thought', 'thrown', 'mix', 'Travers', 'who', 'can', 'not', 'sleep', 'nights', 'experiences', 'heart', 'problems', 'confides', 'priest', 'nun', 'separately', 'was', 'better', 'liked.Their', 'soft', 'sell', 'approach', 'advancing', 'more', 'blessed', 'give', 'receive', 'accompanying', 'feel', 'good', 'element', 'charity', 'prompts', 'Travers', 'see', 'things', 'light', 'more', 'favorable', 'interests', 'St.', ""Mary's.Crosby"", 'Bergman', 'are', 'delights', 'behold', 'feel', 'good', 'film', 'provide', 'challenges', 'other', 'disagreement', 'effective', 'front', 'when', 'team', 'up', 'issue', 'greatest', 'importance', 'welfare', 'St.', 'Mary', 'parish']",N/A
