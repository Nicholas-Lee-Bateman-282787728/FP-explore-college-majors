Hate him if you choose to, this brotha has the ability to light up a stage and get every fan involved. His performance on this album is almost like a stage play. His band, (talented by the way) directed by Valdez Brantley on keyboards made the music sound much more enhanced than any of his studio recordings. The dancers gave the production an intriguing storyline with the focus geared towards intimacy, love, peace, unity and equality. Overall, this is a great performance and every song was delievered with sensational zest and vigor!!! He needs to release a live album with all new songs one day and I will definitely be in attendance!!",5,Definition of a LIVE album!!!!,1074902400,"01 24, 2004",2004,744,"['Usher', 'a-k-a', 'quot', 'Mr.', 'Entertainment', 'quot', 'astounding', 'array', 'versatility', 'live', 'DVD', 'Hate', 'choose', 'brotha', 'ability', 'light', 'up', 'stage', 'get', 'fan', 'involved', 'performance', 'album', 'almost', 'stage', 'play', 'band', 'talented', 'way', 'directed', 'Valdez', 'Brantley', 'keyboards', 'made', 'music', 'sound', 'much', 'more', 'enhanced', 'studio', 'recordings', 'dancers', 'gave', 'production', 'intriguing', 'storyline', 'focus', 'geared', 'towards', 'intimacy', 'love', 'peace', 'unity', 'equality', 'Overall', 'great', 'performance', 'song', 'was', 'delievered', 'sensational', 'zest', 'vigor', 'release', 'live', 'album', 'new', 'songs', 'one', 'day', 'will', 'definitely', 'be', 'attendance']",N/A

I don't think this is a good DVD for kids maybe 16-17 years old or younger.  Some of the stuff he does, like putting his hand down his pants etc. I wouldn't want my own child to see (if I had one.)  But his dancers are really very pretty and aren't ""trashy"" like some of the girls that we see on ""MTV.""  They are seductive, but they're not nasty.  In my opinion.

Sure most people in the game today (Ginuwine, Usher, Timberlake) all use Michael Jackson moves b/c that was there idol growing up but now in today's younger generation the dance moves are taking from the old and creating with the new.  Usher really went all out on this dvd.  From being slick with the girl from the audience to his amazing dance moves....this is THE man! check it out.
