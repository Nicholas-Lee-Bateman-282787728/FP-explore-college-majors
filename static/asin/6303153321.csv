Maybe since two of the cast members went on to star in the HBO phenomenon &quot;The Sopranos,&quot; it will be reissued, perhaps in DVD. We can only hope.James Gandolfini has what was probably his best film role in this 1994  film directed by Martha Coolidge (Rambling Rose et al.).  Ironic that his  meatiest film role, finds him looking a lot leaner (maybe it's about time  he considered salads).  For once he's not cast as a hood or a thug.  Aida  Turturro is along for the ride as well, and has a good time playing the  role of the title character's put upon best friend.That title character  is the brassy, spirited young Brooklyn woman faced with the dilemma of  unwanted pregnancy and a potentially stifling marriage. As played by Geena  Davis, Angie is much more than the &quot;woman's movie&quot; cliche she  could have been.  Davis turns in a multi-dimensional performance that  should have been more widely recognized.  Unfortunately, despite the  top-notch acting, the movie is often quite static and the pacing listless.  It has the feel of a late-70s woman's self-discovery flick--which feels a  little dated (and was even in the early 90s).  Still it's a worthwhile film  with fine acting.

""Angie"" is a film about an Italian/American woman from the Bensonhurst section of Brooklyn, N.Y. Her mom left her when she was a child & because of this she has a romanticized notion of her mother & a deep fear of abandonment. She wants more out of life than her working class plumber boyfriend (and father of her child) can offer her so she falls in love with a lawyer from Ireland while pregnant(someone as far removed from her Brooklyn world as possible!) After the baby is born, the lawyer dumps her & she also feels rejected by her son (you'll have to see the movie to find out why) so she heads off to Texas to finally face her mom for some type of closure. Yes, this character's angst & situations can be overwhelming , but real life can be like that too sometimes. The musical score, by Jerry Goldsmith, is excellent (particularly ""Angie's Theme"") & compliments the movie wonderfully. The movie also has a knack for capturing the New York Italian/American experience authentically.
