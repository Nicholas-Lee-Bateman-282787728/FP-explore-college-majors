499711,A3KA6CG7VG4JAK,B00000F7GF,Buzz1954,"[0, 0]","This is a movie that has not been given NEAR the credit that it is due.First we have to start with the voices, & what voices they are!Robert Goulet as Jaune Tom.Jaune Tom is a country cat, who is regarded as the world's greatest mouser, & he is indeed. When he sees a mouse, one of his eyes closes, & the other one becomes a kind of radar screen, zeroing in on his target. He bunches-up, & from the end of his tail, electricity crackles forward, & it is like he is literally shot out of a cannon. No mouse stands a chance against him. But he is quite satisfied with country life, & doesn't see the attraction of the big city. His only interest, is being in the presence of his true love, Mewsette.Judy Garland as MewsetteMewsette is a farm cat that has been raised in a comfortable setting, & as Jaune Tom is in love with her, she's in love with him as well.But when Jeanette, the sister of Marie who owns Mewsette, makes a visit from the city, & complains about the plain settings of living in the country, Mewsette is captivated by the stories of what living in Paris is like, & decides to ""accompany"" Jeanette to Paris by stowing away in the carriage that Jeanette came in on from the train station. Despite her feelings for Jaune Tom, who she now regards as ""plebeian peasant"", she sets out for Paris to become a sophisticated city cat, instead of an ordinary farm cat.Red Buttons as RobespierreRobespierre is a kitten, who is Juane Tom's best friend. He can't see the attraction that Juane Tom has for Mewsette, & would much rather become a mouser like like Juane Tom. When Mewsette leaves for Paris, Robespierre is overjoyed, & rushes to tell Jaune Tom, who only gets angry with him, & rushes off in an attempt to stop Mewsette. But Robespierre's loyalty to Jaune Tom cannot be swayed, & despite that he is just a kitten, while Jaune Tom is a full grown cat, he too sets off for Paris.Paul Frees as MeowriceMeowrice is a con artist, who will do anything for a buck. When he encounters Mewsette upon coming into Paris on the train, he quickly ""charms"" the naive Mewsette into believing that he can help her become the ""sophisticated"" city cat, that Mewsette desires. And it seems like that is exactly what he does, but we find out that he has other ulterior motives-namely what money he can get out of using Mewsette for his own ends.Hermione Gingold as Mme. Rubens-ChatteMme. Rubens-Chatte is almost as much of a con-artist as Meowrice is. They have had more than a few ""dealings"" with each other, & she love money as much as he does. But she runs the most luxurious ""etiquette"" salon in Paris for introducing cats like Mewsette into Paris Society. Despite knowing what Meowrice has planned for Mewsette, she develops an affection for Mewsette, although that affection is short lived, when she thinks about the money that Meowrice is going to pay her for training Mewsette. (Some may remember Hermione Gingold as the wife of River City's mayor, in the musical-The Music Man.)The Music of Gay Purr-eeWhen you have voices like Judy Garland & Robert Goulet, you KNOW there is going to be some great singing, & Gay Purr-ee does not disappoint.With lyrics by E.Y. Harburg & music by the great Harold Arlen, (of Wizard of Oz fame), and songs like ""Roses Red, Violets Blue"", & ""Paris is a Lonely Town"", (sung by Judy Garland), & ""Mewsette"", & ""Little Drops of Rain"", (sung by Robert Goulet), these songs work very well to support the storyline, and are absolutely delightful, & heart-wrenching at the same time.One further note should be mentioned as well, in regard to the music of Gay Purr-ee.The song ""The Money Cat"", that is sung by the character of Meowrice, is NOT sung by Frees, but by an uncredited Thurl Ravenscroft, (who was not only well-known as the voice of Tony the Tiger, but was also the man who did such a wonderful job with the song-""You're a Mean One, Mr. Grinch"", from the animated ""How the Grinch Stole Christmas"").Gay Purr-ee is a movie that has never received the honor that is due it.It is a wonderful story of love, desire, lies & deceit, & the couple who created it, the brilliant animator Chuck Jones, & his wife Dorothy, should have gotten much more praise for it than they did.A quick note should be made here, & that is that Chuck Jones was still under contract to Warner Brothers when he & his wife created Gay Purr-ee, & this film was in violation OF that contract. This resulted in Warner Brothers firing him.This is a great movie for all ages, & is a must-see for all animation fans!",5,A Movie that Hasn't gotten the credit that is due it!,1340755200,"06 27, 2012",2012,4516,"['movie', 'not', 'been', 'given', 'credit', 'due.First', 'have', 'start', 'voices', 'what', 'are', 'Robert', 'Goulet', 'Jaune', 'Tom.Jaune', 'Tom', 'country', 'cat', 'who', 'regarded', 'world', 'greatest', 'mouser', 'indeed', 'When', 'mouse', 'one', 'eyes', 'closes', 'other', 'one', 'kind', 'radar', 'screen', 'zeroing', 'target', 'bunches-up', 'end', 'tail', 'electricity', 'crackles', 'forward', 'literally', 'shot', 'cannon', 'mouse', 'chance', 'quite', 'satisfied', 'country', 'life', ""n't"", 'see', 'attraction', 'big', 'city', 'only', 'interest', 'being', 'presence', 'true', 'love', 'Mewsette.Judy', 'Garland', 'MewsetteMewsette', 'farm', 'cat', 'been', 'raised', 'comfortable', 'setting', 'Jaune', 'Tom', 'love', 'love', 'well.But', 'when', 'Jeanette', 'sister', 'Marie', 'who', 'Mewsette', 'visit', 'city', 'complains', 'plain', 'settings', 'living', 'country', 'Mewsette', 'captivated', 'stories', 'what', 'living', 'Paris', 'accompany', 'Jeanette', 'Paris', 'stowing', 'away', 'carriage', 'Jeanette', 'came', 'train', 'station', 'feelings', 'Jaune', 'Tom', 'who', 'now', 'plebeian', 'peasant', 'out', 'Paris', 'become', 'sophisticated', 'city', 'cat', 'instead', 'ordinary', 'farm', 'cat.Red', 'Buttons', 'RobespierreRobespierre', 'kitten', 'who', 'Juane', 'Tom', 'best', 'friend', 'ca', ""n't"", 'see', 'attraction', 'Juane', 'Tom', 'Mewsette', 'would', 'much', 'rather', 'become', 'mouser', 'Juane', 'Tom', 'When', 'Mewsette', 'Paris', 'Robespierre', 'overjoyed', 'rushes', 'tell', 'Jaune', 'Tom', 'who', 'only', 'angry', 'rushes', 'off', 'attempt', 'stop', 'Mewsette', 'Robespierre', 'loyalty', 'Jaune', 'Tom', 'can', 'not', 'be', 'swayed', 'just', 'kitten', 'Jaune', 'Tom', 'full', 'grown', 'cat', 'too', 'off', 'Paris.Paul', 'Frees', 'MeowriceMeowrice', 'con', 'artist', 'who', 'will', 'do', 'anything', 'buck', 'When', 'Mewsette', 'coming', 'Paris', 'train', 'quickly', 'charms', 'naive', 'Mewsette', 'believing', 'can', 'help', 'become', 'sophisticated', 'city', 'cat', 'Mewsette', 'desires', 'exactly', 'what', 'find', 'out', 'other', 'ulterior', 'motives-namely', 'what', 'money', 'can', 'get', 'using', 'Mewsette', 'own', 'ends.Hermione', 'Gingold', 'Mme', 'Rubens-ChatteMme', 'Rubens-Chatte', 'almost', 'much', 'con-artist', 'Meowrice', 'have', 'had', 'more', 'few', 'dealings', 'other', 'money', 'as', 'much', 'most', 'luxurious', 'etiquette', 'salon', 'Paris', 'introducing', 'cats', 'Mewsette', 'Paris', 'Society', 'knowing', 'what', 'Meowrice', 'planned', 'Mewsette', 'affection', 'Mewsette', 'affection', 'short', 'lived', 'when', 'money', 'Meowrice', 'going', 'pay', 'training', 'Mewsette', 'may', 'remember', 'Hermione', 'Gingold', 'wife', 'River', 'City', 'mayor', 'musical-The', 'Music', 'Man', 'Music', 'Gay', 'Purr-eeWhen', 'have', 'voices', 'Judy', 'Garland', 'Robert', 'Goulet', 'KNOW', 'going', 'be', 'great', 'singing', 'Gay', 'Purr-ee', 'not', 'disappoint.With', 'lyrics', 'E.Y', 'Harburg', 'music', 'great', 'Harold', 'Arlen', 'Wizard', 'Oz', 'fame', 'songs', 'Roses', 'Red', 'Violets', 'Blue', 'Paris', 'Lonely', 'Town', 'sung', 'Judy', 'Garland', 'Mewsette', 'Little', 'Drops', 'Rain', 'sung', 'Robert', 'Goulet', 'songs', 'work', 'very', 'well', 'support', 'storyline', 'are', 'absolutely', 'delightful', 'heart-wrenching', 'same', 'time.One', 'further', 'note', 'should', 'be', 'mentioned', 'as', 'well', 'regard', 'music', 'Gay', 'Purr-ee.The', 'song', 'Money', 'Cat', 'sung', 'character', 'Meowrice', 'NOT', 'sung', 'Frees', 'uncredited', 'Thurl', 'Ravenscroft', 'who', 'was', 'not', 'only', 'well-known', 'voice', 'Tony', 'Tiger', 'was', 'also', 'man', 'who', 'did', 'wonderful', 'job', 'song-', ""'re"", 'Mean', 'One', 'Mr.', 'Grinch', 'animated', 'How', 'Grinch', 'Stole', 'Christmas', '.Gay', 'Purr-ee', 'movie', 'never', 'received', 'honor', 'due', 'it.It', 'wonderful', 'story', 'love', 'desire', 'deceit', 'couple', 'who', 'created', 'brilliant', 'animator', 'Chuck', 'Jones', 'wife', 'Dorothy', 'should', 'have', 'gotten', 'much', 'more', 'praise', 'did.A', 'quick', 'note', 'should', 'be', 'made', 'here', 'Chuck', 'Jones', 'was', 'still', 'contract', 'Warner', 'Brothers', 'when', 'wife', 'created', 'Gay', 'Purr-ee', 'film', 'was', 'violation', 'contract', 'resulted', 'Warner', 'Brothers', 'firing', 'him.This', 'great', 'movie', 'ages', 'must-see', 'animation', 'fans']",N/A

The villain Meowrice aka ""The Money Cat"" is appropriately diabolical as he kidnaps naive cats who arrive in the city and sells them for what he can.There is even an episode where a series of portraits of the female cat heroine (Mewsette) are imagined as if painted by all the great French artists of the century past - from Renoir to Cezanne to Picasso.

My God, was I wrong!  Jeez, was I embarrassed! As my kids were watching it, for as young as they were, they still showed facial expressions of being disgusted with it's lame, unamusing, out-dated charm and of its being so unappealing.  I almost ran to the bathroom to throw up because I was so embarrassed for having them watch such a lame, boorish, cartoon.The story is just, well, so-so, nothing exceptional.  But, the songs are stomach-wretching!  That kind of music was out-dated even in 1962.  You'd have to be over 80 to find these songs entertaining.  I had to apologize to my kids.  Now, they're going to question me on anything else I bring home on DVD.  I really blew it!  Now, I desperately have to get rid of this stupid DVD quickly.  But, who can I give it to?  Someone under the age of 4, or someone older than 80 years old?  If I just threw it in the trash, my trash can would feel insulted.I'm looking at the stupid DVD movie cover right now.  I'm feeling flushed and ill!  I only hope I don't vomit on my keyboard!Believe me, think before you buy this movie.  And, don't think that you're going to be doing your kids any favors with this one.  This film will kill your credibility with them!

The animation style reflects the Warner Brothers studio's short cartoons and has the look and feel of Chuck Jones' influence. Most importantly, it's funny when it needs to be. I've seen this many times over the last 40 years and it's still funny. Especially the cat villain Meowrice, voiced by Paul Frees and Hermione Gingold as the cat madam. Judy Garland's performance is bright and perky, her singing voice still vibrant. Besides a trip down memory lane, this is a great family film suitable for the young, and young at heart.My only complaint is that the movie was produced full frame, but the DVD is ""matted"" to match the theatrical aspect ratio. This has aired countless times full frame on tv, and that's how everyone is used to seeing it.
