It starts with a funeral scene for the electric car.  Now both political sides of me came together and found the ensuing scene loathesome.  The conservative in me saw this as simplistic propaganda, and the liberal in me who loves alternative energy wanted to scream that this was fodder for conservative commentators who would pounce at any opportunity to squelch all designs for windmills, solar, and electric fuels.  But they quickly redeem themselves.  After the insipid funeral scene they turn the documentary into a substantative Whodunit that investigates all the suspects and thoroughly scopes the scene of the crime.The clues come from the evidence which doesn't add up when so many people were happy with their electric cars.  While some of them are articulate celebrities (from Tom Hanks to Mel Gibson) there are many pedestrian people who are just as passionate and down-to-earth about their devotion to the alternatively fueled vehicle.  It really comes down to understanding that the automobile industry benefits from a car's shorter longeivity, and the documented demand for more electric cars doesn't square with corporate testimony.  Admirably, all counter arguments are given their proper space even as the car's mileage has improved for each recharging.  (How many people drive more than 150 miles round trip on an average given day?)Given the issues at stake:  A war that has some energy import, domestic security, high profits for oil companies during leaner times, and a constant need for an improving environment, the case is stacked against the corporations.  But, I must say, I haven't given away the entire day in court.  There's much more testimony that I won't divulge and more suspects who may be complicit in the murder.The crime scene mostly takes place in California where the levels of pollution may have some of the rest of us taking their plight for granted.  After seeing this film both sides of me came together and was quite satisfied with the verdict and all of it's educational ramifications.  The conservative in me would love to see alternative fuels compete against the corporations with new companies that would eventually bring the big wigs down to earth.  The liberal in me would love to see government funded laboratories that would provide more alternative fuels that would end the conspiracy of lies that keeps our country more dependent on foreign oil, with higher energy costs, and with major pollutants that continue to mar our environment.  Although liberally slanted, the defense gets their time in court.

177537,A32T2H8150OJLU,1424819547,ARH,"[3, 4]","Not long ago a relatively small group of people were able to participate in a lease-only option to drive some of General Motors' fleet of EV-1 cars.  The EV-1 was a prototype all-electric car. The EV-1 was developed mainly to meet a growing need and market in California.  At the time California was developing a plan to require lower emission rates and more environmentally-friendly personal transportation options.GE was working with Californian power companies to install infrastructure needed to support the EV-1.  Everything seemed to be going great.  The people who leased EV-1 cars absolutely loved them.  The EV-1 looked and handled great, had plenty of power, and had effective range for the urban driver.  If you owned an EV-1 you plugged it in when you got home, unplugged it in the morning, and drove to work where you could plug it in again, and so on...Then, one day, all the people leasing EV-1 cars were contacted and instructed that their leases had been terminated, and, in acordance with their lease agreements, were to make their EV-1 cars available to collection.  No one was given any explanation about the reason for the termination of the EV-1 pilot program, and no one was allowed to purchase their EV-1 car.  People were loathe to give up their EV-1s, but, alas, they were legally obligated to do so.After some of the cars were picked up a network of EV-1 drivers and friends tracked the car carriers and found that the cars were being systematically destroyed.  What!?  Why?  That is the mystery!!!This video explores what non-GE proponents of the EV-1 program were able to learn about the development and then termination of the EV-1 pilot program.  While this video is quite obviously spun in favor of EV-1 proponents, it nevertheless provides an interesting set of observations and insights into market and political forces that almost certainly led to the demise of the EV-1.What makes this story even more compelling today is the appearance and marketing of GE's Volt...a hybrid-electric car that runs entirely on electricity, and then, when the battery charge drops far enough, a small gas-powered engine kicks on to assist with recharging the batteries as the car is driven.Hm...OK, main players referred to in this DVD include senior GE execs, the Gov of Calif and the Pres of the USA (Bush), and others.if you are interested in politico-environmental issues, then this story is definitely for you.

For whilst containing factual information, it is also served with a healthy slice of bias and a side-order of partisan alliance. In point of fact, this film should actually be entitled 'In America, Who Killed the GM EV-1?' For what it is, is not a balanced expos&eacute; of electric or alternative-energy vehicles worldwide, rather, a shallow foray into that the dark corners of America's Corporate-Capitalist Automobile Giants and in particular the EV-1 (it does very briefly mention other electric vehicles produced at that period) - but not electric vehicles in their entirety. After all most countries still employ the use of electric vehicles in airports, on golf-courses and for some aspects of delivery - not to mention the Segway. In terms of presenting a balanced, coherent, fair and articulate argument, I believe all these facts are all worthy of mention. Likewise a good deal more scientific data from independent sources and a good deal less of the 'cut to shot of collapsing iceberg' at the mere mention of climate change.For the educated, the aware and those with active cognition, the contents of this film may entertain you, but they are unlikely to offer any startling revelations. What is perhaps more interesting in this awkward narrative, is not the untimely demise of the EV-1 per se., but the exposed workings of the American Corporate-Capitalism machine, and how the U.S. government really encourages the dark side of humanity and commerce to prosper and flourish under the flag of convenience and the name of freedom; also, how alliances, allegiances and factions are formed and re-formed, how governments favour their own and rarely favour the electorate.

The film tries to answer the question ""Who killed the [all] electric car?"" but it leaves several important issues unaddressed, such as the real costs and economics of manufacturing this type of vehicle, any potential operating hazards, and the eventual recycling of toxic substances in the batteries.  It also skims over the facts that batteries seriously lose efficiency in cold weather and that the recharging electricity must be produced in a power plant somewhere, so air pollution is typically just displaced from one area to another (Anyone for more wind and solar power generation?)  On the other hand, as a long-time hydrogen power skeptic, I thoroughly enjoyed the segment  ""The five miracles that must occur for a hydrogen car to succeed.""At the end of the movie I found myself pondering today's hybrids, which are becoming steadily more efficient and economically feasible, with higher production levels and ongoing improvements to their batteries and other technologies.  Hybrids, after all, typically include within themselves a complete electric car, but with a small gasoline engine to generate electricity when the batteries are down and various mechanism(s) to power the drive wheels using either or both power sources.  Who knows?  These vehicles might eventually evolve into plug-in hybrids whose batteries can be recharged electrically at your home (or elsewhere) as an alternative to using the gasoline engine (they already are), and then some bright engineer may decide that the small internal combustion engine and all the complex (and expensive) power-switching apparatus can be eliminated on cars used for shorter trips, and presto, the all-electric car returns!I highly recommend that you watch this documentary and then think about what you've seen.",4,A thought-provoking documentary,1179014400,"05 13, 2007",2007,2081,"['absorbing', 'documentary', 'mainly', 'focused', 'GM', 'EV-1', 'all-electric', 'car', 'was', 'test-deployed', 'short', 'time', 'Southern', 'California', 'parts', 'Arizona', 'response', 'Southern', 'California', 'zero-emission', 'vehicle', 'mandate', 'later', 'rescinded', 'really', 'should', 'watch', 'movie', 'details', 'film', 'tries', 'answer', 'question', 'Who', 'killed', '[', ']', 'electric', 'car', 'several', 'important', 'issues', 'unaddressed', 'such', 'real', 'costs', 'economics', 'manufacturing', 'type', 'vehicle', 'potential', 'operating', 'hazards', 'eventual', 'recycling', 'toxic', 'substances', 'batteries', 'also', 'facts', 'seriously', 'lose', 'efficiency', 'cold', 'weather', 'recharging', 'electricity', 'must', 'be', 'produced', 'power', 'plant', 'somewhere', 'air', 'pollution', 'typically', 'just', 'displaced', 'one', 'area', 'Anyone', 'more', 'wind', 'solar', 'power', 'generation', 'other', 'hand', 'long-time', 'hydrogen', 'power', 'skeptic', 'thoroughly', 'enjoyed', 'segment', 'five', 'miracles', 'must', 'occur', 'hydrogen', 'car', 'succeed', 'end', 'movie', 'found', 'pondering', 'today', 'hybrids', 'are', 'becoming', 'steadily', 'more', 'efficient', 'economically', 'feasible', 'higher', 'production', 'levels', 'ongoing', 'improvements', 'batteries', 'other', 'technologies', 'Hybrids', 'typically', 'include', 'complete', 'electric', 'car', 'small', 'gasoline', 'engine', 'generate', 'electricity', 'when', 'batteries', 'are', 'down', 'various', 'mechanism', 'power', 'drive', 'wheels', 'using', 'power', 'sources', 'Who', 'vehicles', 'might', 'eventually', 'evolve', 'plug-in', 'hybrids', 'batteries', 'can', 'be', 'recharged', 'electrically', 'home', 'elsewhere', 'alternative', 'using', 'gasoline', 'engine', 'already', 'are', 'then', 'bright', 'engineer', 'may', 'decide', 'small', 'internal', 'combustion', 'engine', 'complex', 'expensive', 'power-switching', 'apparatus', 'can', 'be', 'eliminated', 'cars', 'used', 'shorter', 'trips', 'presto', 'all-electric', 'car', 'returns', 'highly', 'recommend', 'watch', 'documentary', 'then', 'think', 'what', ""'ve"", 'seen']",N/A

I do think that what the automakers did to the electric car is inexcusable. You'll witness, in this documentary, the way in which a product was placed on the market, found an (limited) audience, and then was completely abandoned by the auto industry. For some reason, the car magnates disregarded the fundamental code of business--if the customer wants it, give it to them--in the case of the electric car. The consumer group profiled has cash on hand to buy their cars but the auto giants wouldn't grant their purchase of it, and then, rather than recoup some of their lost R&D costs, they chose to destroy the vehicles before giving them to the consumer. That's sickening in my opinion. My biggest criticism of the documentary is that it ducks the major issue: a tremendous amount of carbon emitting, fossil fuels are burned in the production of electricity. Electric cars may be non-pollutants but all the pollution that goes into an electric battery must be considered and somehow offset in order for the electric car to be a savior of the environment.

A: Commercial interests, if they felt threatened enough.  This documentary relates the cynical destruction by big business of a 100% viable electric car that policy-making pressures had helped to develop in the mid-1990s.  Politicians were enlisted, policy-makers were choked off, and dull advertising campaigns were conjured up to 'prove' that public enthusiasm for the vehicle was low.  Hundreds of vehicles were then systematically destroyed while many people who'd leased them stood by, petitioning and even begging, cash in hand, for a chance to buy them back.This stunning documentary illustrates each step in that process, and the alarming but nearly routine way in which our political leaders let the dog of sound social policy be wagged by the tail of big business.  As a result, California has now stopped its steady progress to reduce the damage caused by the internal combustion engine, abandoning an improved technology that, however slowly, had begun to replace it.  This fast, efficient, smoothly-working electric car required far fewer repairs, parts and maintenance, and was even chargeable from the home -- needing no special infrastructure.  Perhaps as important as stopping the toll of deaths by air pollution, its eventual promise was to free up the ballooning amounts the US now spends to fund military ventures that secure the fuel to which our societies seem so addicted.  But political leaders mobilized to retrace those steps forward, and vested interests prevailed: the automotive and car-parts industries, the huge network of gas stations, and, of course, the almighty oil industry.As winning as any Michael Moore expos&eacute;, this documentary has the advantage of a rigour that his anecdotal work generally lacks.That said, I'd have liked to see detailed analysis on the effects of coal pollution if more of us drove these cars.  Also, the producers could have more thoroughly reinforced just why the hydrogen vehicle, a source of huge investment and promotion in California and the US, is not, as they indicate, an effective solution on which to pin so many hopes.  Finally, some hard figures could have shown to what extent the Japanese have cornered the hybrid car market, which is becoming more affordable by the day.  A projection of their future prospects might have also shed light on how this may pose a greater threat to big business in North America than the electric vehicles that were dragged in perfect working order to the back of the barn, way off in Arizona somewhere, and purposely destroyed.

Merritt ""filmreviewstew.com""","[9, 11]","Whether you're ""green"" or ""industry"", a smoker or an asthmatic, rich or poor, WHO KILLED THE ELECTRIC CAR is a great look at corporate greed and consumer apathy in the United States.Similar in its documentary tone to ENRON: THE SMARTEST GUYS IN THE ROOM, Who Killed The Electric Car delves into General Motors' production of the infamous EV1, the company's first mainline electric car. First built in 1996, the EV1 was the epitome of what an electric car should be. It had power (0-60 mph in 3-4 seconds), could travel around 80 miles on a charge, and was relatively affordable. But as soon as the EV1 made its appearance, GM decided to snuff the project by hamstringing it wherever possible. Few (if any) TV ads made it to prime-time. An extremely limited number were produced (under 1,000). Consumers were unaware of their existence. GM obviously couldn't have cared less. All of the EV1s were leased, and once their lease option date came due, GM recollected them and scrapped every last vehicle.The big question is ""why?"" The answers vary as much as any industry-wide controversy. Fingers are pointed at GM itself for its greed/need to turn profits quickly and in large proportions. Legal entanglements with the air quality board in California are also hit upon as the Zero Emission Mandate comes under attack by GM, Chrysler, and Ford. Consumer apathy is a big issue, too. Not until gas prices rose above $2.00 per gallon did most consumers ever consider buying hybrids or electrics. Of course, we also have the Federal government which has done absolutely nothing in terms of aiding air quality within the U.S. Being bound tightly to oil tycoons and lobbyists continues to pay a staggering toll on healthcare (respiratory diseases are spiraling out of control as smog alerts plague cities like L.A.).The film begins and ends with a mock funeral, an electric car funeral. Movie stars Alexandra Paul (BAYWATCH), J. Karen Thomas (GENTLE BEN), and several other Hollywood types attended the ceremonies, giving a bit of press to an event that otherwise would've gone almost completely unnoticed. An unfortunately pathetic statement.But there is hope. The end of the film shows us the emergence of new battery technologies that will allow electric's to travel further on a single charge. That Toyota's Prius hybrid has over 150,000 cars on the road is an excellent trend. Now we just need to hope that gas prices continue to rise. If they do, oil companies will destroy themselves via their own greed. People WILL switch to alternative fuel cars if crude prices continue their ascent.

A good example of this is the electric car. We saw them when they came out; some people were happy about it and some people just didn't care. However, when they were taken out of circulation, few of us noticed, and continued with our daily existence. The magnificent and eye-opening ""Who killed the Electric Car"" carefully examines the history of this innovative technological advance, in a very detailed and non-partisan way.The documentary begins with the symbolic burial of the last electric car on July 24, 2003, at the Hollywood Forever cemetery, where some known figures - including actor Ed Begley, Jr., known for environmental causes -- were featured key speakers. It then sends us way, way back, when the first so-called electric car was manufactured about one hundred years ago, an idea that didn't last. The idea has always been to generate a car that is quiet and doesn't exhaust unhealthful emissions. The film moves on in explaining the health effects of smog in California, and how General Motors developed EV1, the first electric car, in 1996, explaining the role of the California Air Resources Board (CARB) in the process. CARB enacted the EC mandate, which said that 10 % of the cars sold on California were meant to be of 0 emissions. The electric car slowly began gaining clientele that included celebrities, such as Tom Hanks, Mel Gibson, Alexandra Paul, and others.Unfortunately, the oil companies, of course, began fighting back against such a novel concept, claiming, among other things, that the environmental benefits of electric cars were bogus, and that only rich people could afford them. Meanwhile, President George Bush began pushing for his proposal of the hydrogen-powered car. In the end, on April 24, 2003, CARB killed the EC mandate under dubious circumstances.

And it is a pretty darn interesting nugget if I may say so. GM, pretending they actually care, put out on the road high quality electric cars. Then, just as quickly, forced them out of the hands of those who had leased them and destroyed them. This film puts on its liberal do-gooder hat and tries to get to the bottom of just why these cars are no longer on the road. Suspects such as the oil companies, the auto industry, and consumers are all tried and found guilty. The documentary itself is on task and never resort to cheap shots (I'm looking at you ""Super Size Me""). Martin Sheen provides the narration and does a pitch perfect job of it as he conveys a calm yet serious tone.With the combination of great ideas and great editing ""Who Killed the Electric Car"" is a powerful and educational film. Add to that the great footage that they have and you realize that the film is also a hoot to watch. We get clips of George W. Bush (Mr. Wrong Side of History himself) showing up to shovel some dirt onto the grave of the electric car. There is a flyover of GM's testing grounds in Arizona that showed all of the electric cars that had been secretly smuggled away from the public eye so they could be demolished. My personal favorite was that of an old news reel from back in the day when oil was initially discovered in Iraq. The clip hypes all of the great things that are to come to the people of Iraq because of this discovery. I guess if you count civil war, foreign bombs, and George W. Bush's military as great things then they were right on the money.  Near the end we get to watch as protestors try to block the remaining EV1's from the grave, but luckily for GM the fuzz arrives to take the side of the monied interest. It should serve as a reminder that the system wants you and me to be as dumb as Dax Sheppard's character in ""Idiocracy,"" and if we let them know that we are smarter than that then their reaction is always to sick the cops on us.The film makes the point that people can be convinced to buy anything and that the auto companies should use that for good not evil. Just because people are sort of stupid and have been known to pound their chest and demand more speed doesn't mean that they should have a Hummer marketed to them. The interviews were informative and energetic. Not that I needed more reason to hate Ronald Reagan, but I had fun listening to how he found it necessary to take the solar panels off the White House that Jimmy Carter had placed there. Even if he wasn't going to use them wouldn't it just be easier to leave them there and pretend that he cared about the environment? At the end Sheen tells us that not all is wrong in the world. GM is obviously killing itself by only thinking short term and those consequences will be starting sooner rather than later. This film gets a high recommendation from me, nobody should refuse to watch it. ***1/2",3,A Murder Mystery That Affects Us All,1172188800,"02 23, 2007",2007,2996,"['really', 'do', 'try', 'keep', 'up', 'news', 'somehow', 'missed', 'little', 'nugget', 'recent', 'history', 'pretty', 'darn', 'interesting', 'nugget', 'may', 'say', 'so', 'GM', 'pretending', 'actually', 'care', 'put', 'out', 'road', 'high', 'quality', 'electric', 'cars', 'Then', 'just', 'quickly', 'forced', 'hands', 'who', 'had', 'leased', 'destroyed', 'film', 'liberal', 'do-gooder', 'hat', 'tries', 'get', 'bottom', 'just', 'why', 'cars', 'are', 'no', 'longer', 'road', 'Suspects', 'such', 'oil', 'companies', 'auto', 'industry', 'consumers', 'are', 'tried', 'found', 'guilty', 'documentary', 'task', 'never', 'resort', 'cheap', 'shots', ""'m"", 'looking', 'Super', 'Size', 'Me', 'Martin', 'Sheen', 'narration', 'pitch', 'perfect', 'job', 'calm', 'yet', 'serious', 'combination', 'great', 'ideas', 'great', 'editing', 'Who', 'Killed', 'Electric', 'Car', 'powerful', 'educational', 'film', 'Add', 'great', 'footage', 'have', 'realize', 'film', 'also', 'hoot', 'watch', 'get', 'clips', 'George', 'W.', 'Bush', 'Mr.', 'Wrong', 'Side', 'History', 'showing', 'up', 'shovel', 'dirt', 'grave', 'electric', 'car', 'flyover', 'GM', 'testing', 'grounds', 'Arizona', 'showed', 'electric', 'cars', 'had', 'been', 'secretly', 'smuggled', 'away', 'public', 'eye', 'could', 'be', 'demolished', 'personal', 'favorite', 'was', 'old', 'news', 'reel', 'back', 'day', 'when', 'oil', 'was', 'initially', 'discovered', 'Iraq', 'clip', 'great', 'things', 'are', 'come', 'people', 'Iraq', 'discovery', 'guess', 'count', 'civil', 'war', 'foreign', 'bombs', 'George', 'W.', 'Bush', 'military', 'great', 'things', 'then', 'were', 'right', 'money', 'end', 'get', 'watch', 'protestors', 'try', 'block', 'remaining', 'EV1', 'grave', 'luckily', 'GM', 'fuzz', 'take', 'side', 'monied', 'interest', 'should', 'serve', 'reminder', 'system', 'be', 'as', 'dumb', 'Dax', 'Sheppard', 'character', 'Idiocracy', 'let', 'know', 'are', 'smarter', 'then', 'reaction', 'always', 'sick', 'cops', 'us.The', 'film', 'point', 'people', 'can', 'be', 'convinced', 'buy', 'anything', 'auto', 'companies', 'should', 'use', 'good', 'not', 'evil', 'Just', 'people', 'are', 'sort', 'stupid', 'have', 'been', 'known', 'pound', 'chest', 'demand', 'more', 'speed', ""n't"", 'mean', 'should', 'have', 'Hummer', 'marketed', 'interviews', 'were', 'informative', 'energetic', 'Not', 'needed', 'more', 'reason', 'hate', 'Ronald', 'Reagan', 'had', 'fun', 'listening', 'how', 'found', 'necessary', 'take', 'solar', 'panels', 'White', 'House', 'Jimmy', 'Carter', 'had', 'placed', 'there', 'Even', 'was', ""n't"", 'going', 'use', 'would', ""n't"", 'just', 'be', 'easier', 'leave', 'there', 'pretend', 'cared', 'environment', 'end', 'Sheen', 'not', 'wrong', 'world', 'GM', 'obviously', 'killing', 'only', 'thinking', 'short', 'term', 'consequences', 'will', 'be', 'starting', 'sooner', 'rather', 'later', 'film', 'high', 'recommendation', 'nobody', 'should', 'refuse', 'watch', '***1/2']",N/A

Big money cares little about pollution, energy dependence, etc.  Did I own such a vehicle, I could use it for most of my driving until I died and then will it to my offspring.

For about ten years (1996-2006) General Motors and other car companies invested in, built and then leased (but never sold) the EV1 to the public. At one point GM CEO Roger Smith even bragged about the car. GM then pulled the plug, claiming there was too little consumer demand and no profit to be made. This documentary argues that is patently false. Rather, the film makers contend that GM, the Bush administration, the California Air Resources Board, and the oil companies combined to kill the project. In fact, when customer leases expired, GM repossessed every single EV1, refused to allow customers to keep or buy them, then crushed and shredded them in secrecy.

177563,ABN5K7K1TM1QA,1424819547,Dennis Littrell,"[3, 4]","Probably the most alarming thing about this story of how the electric car was literally destroyed is what it reveals about the power of corporations to control our lives.  Film maker Chris Paine, himself an EV1 owner, makes it clear that it was big corporations, especially big oil, and most especially General Motors itself, that woke up one day and asked themselves the multi-billion dollar question: Is an economical and efficient electric vehicle really good for business?  In the case of the oil companies, obviously not since such a vehicle would not be burning any gas or needing any motor oil.  In the case of the car manufacturers themselves, especially GM, which actually spent some very serious bucks on developing the EV1, the answer came as a bit of a surprise.  First of all, they asked themselves, in the long run are you going to make more money building small efficient vehicles or behemoths like the Hummer?  It didn't take long for them to figure out that the profit margins would be higher with the bigger vehicles.  And then they realized that with the EV1 they wouldn't be able to sell many of their combustion-engine parts like oil filters and such.  Furthermore, the EV1 was built to comply with California law.  Doing some more thinking, GM realized that it would never do to allow some state government to tell them what to manufacture.  If things worked out in California, before you know it, the whole nation might very well go plug-in.So, as shown so vividly in this documentary, the car manufactures and the oil companies bought up or scared enough politicians so that the law requiring zero emissions in California went the way of the dodo.  Meanwhile GM, which had been leasing the EV1, recalled them all and literally destroyed them.  Paine has some nice footage showing the brand new and near brand new cars being crushed while EV1 lovers protested in vain.  Nationally of course we know about the bills congress passed allowing truck-sized vehicles to continue to guzzle gas (mostly SUVs) and how 6,000-pound vehicles were given massive tax breaks for small business owners (mostly anybody but a wage earner).There is of course plenty of controversy about whether the story presented by Paine (narration by Martin Sheen, by the way) is fair and accurate.  I did a little research--there is a ton of information on the Web--and what became obvious after not too long was that the electric car not only is a viable alternative to the combustion engine car but really is the wave of the future whether General Motors and the other car manufacturers know it or not.  For now, however, they are not about to change their ways.  They have too much of a vested interest in business as it is.The hydrogen fuel cell red herring is addressed, and, with help from Joseph J. Romm, who wrote The Hype about Hydrogen: Fact and Fiction in the Race to Save the Climate (2004), which I highly recommend, got fed to the dogs.  Naturally there is a clip of George W. Bush pretending to support the hydrogen fuel cell car, even though I am sure he knows that economically it's not even close to a match for the electric car.  Getting the Great Prevaricator to advance the propaganda put out by the oil and vehicle companies surely is something close to proof positive that it's BS.Especially watchable is the clip from Huell Howser's PBS show in which we get to see the EV1s not only being crushed but pulverized into little bits for recycling.So, what's it all about, Alfie?  It's just as Eisenhower warned: beware not just of the industrial-military complex taking over our lives, but beware of corporations in general buying up all the politicians and writing all the laws. In fact, with the way the mass electorate is influenced by advertizing, only politicians pre-approved through campaign donations from big corporations have a chance of even getting the nomination of either of the two main political parties.  And without that nomination, effectively speaking, they can't win.Regardless of all the machinations by GM, et al., I think our grandchildren will be driving mostly electric vehicles with nary a gas station in sight.

Writer/director Chris Paine focuses on the birth and mysterious death of General Motors' pollution-free EV1 battery-electric car. What spurred its 1996 introduction was the 1990 Zero Emissions Vehicle Act (ZEV), which mandated that ten-percent of all new vehicles sold by 2003 must be completely emissions-free. The bulk of the 2006 film deals with GM's ambivalence and subsequent loss of interest in making the EV1 and concurrently, how the California Air Resources Board (CARB), the state's ""clean air"" agency, reversed their position on the ZEV legislation after receiving pressure from the major auto manufacturers, the oil industry and the Bush administration. Once the mandate was lifted, GM and its competitors like Ford wasted little time in recalling the electric cars on the market, all leased since outright ownership was not an option.Paine paces the film well and regales in showing us the conspiratorial elements of the electric car's demise, wherein figure heads such as CARB chairman Alan Lloyd and GM's Dave Barthmuss come across as terse and self-protective. There are also extensive interviews with the engineers and technicians behind the car's invention, the most passionate spokesperson being Chelsea Sexton, who led the initial marketing effort for the EV1 and subsequently became a Norma Rae-like figure in the cause. Where the film gets a bit too glib is in the inclusion of a number of green-friendly celebrities who supported the cause, some even getting arrested for their participation in a Mexican stand-off with GM on the pending demolition of the last 78 EV1's.Like a good Agatha Christie mystery, Paine itemizes the suspected murderers- consumers who were ambivalent and resistant about the new technology, the oil and car companies, the government, the CARB - and all are deemed guilty except the batteries themselves. The film also includes strong criticism leveled against hydrogen as a possible alternative energy source, epitomized by an amusing clip of Bush being shown how to fill up a hydrogen-fueled vehicle, but there is also a guarded note of optimism with the plug-in hybrid, seen as a more viable path of development. As one of the most valuable extras in the DVD, there is a fifteen-minute short, ""Jump-Starting the Future"", which goes deeper into these alternatives. Also on the DVD are fifteen minutes of deleted scenes, all understandably excised, and a rather disposable music video by the band Meeky Rose, who performed the main theme for the film.",4,"Effective, Informative and Sometimes Glib Documentary Structured Like a Murder Mystery",1167782400,"01 3, 2007",2007,2656,"['Dovetailing', 'nicely', 'Al', 'Gore', 'cautionary', 'Inconvenient', 'Truth', 'solid', 'documentary', 'one', 'playing', 'out', 'bit', 'detective', 'story', 'Writer/director', 'Chris', 'Paine', 'birth', 'mysterious', 'death', 'General', 'Motors', 'pollution-free', 'EV1', 'battery-electric', 'car', 'What', 'spurred', '1996', 'introduction', 'was', '1990', 'Zero', 'Emissions', 'Vehicle', 'Act', 'ZEV', 'mandated', 'ten-percent', 'new', 'vehicles', 'sold', '2003', 'must', 'be', 'completely', 'emissions-free', 'bulk', '2006', 'film', 'deals', 'GM', 'ambivalence', 'subsequent', 'loss', 'interest', 'making', 'EV1', 'concurrently', 'how', 'California', 'Air', 'Resources', 'Board', 'CARB', 'state', 'clean', 'air', 'agency', 'reversed', 'position', 'ZEV', 'legislation', 'receiving', 'pressure', 'major', 'auto', 'manufacturers', 'oil', 'industry', 'Bush', 'administration', 'mandate', 'was', 'lifted', 'GM', 'competitors', 'Ford', 'wasted', 'little', 'time', 'recalling', 'electric', 'cars', 'market', 'leased', 'outright', 'ownership', 'was', 'not', 'option.Paine', 'film', 'well', 'regales', 'showing', 'conspiratorial', 'elements', 'electric', 'car', 'demise', 'wherein', 'figure', 'heads', 'such', 'CARB', 'chairman', 'Alan', 'Lloyd', 'GM', 'Dave', 'Barthmuss', 'come', 'terse', 'self-protective', 'are', 'also', 'extensive', 'interviews', 'engineers', 'technicians', 'car', 'invention', 'most', 'passionate', 'spokesperson', 'being', 'Chelsea', 'Sexton', 'who', 'led', 'initial', 'marketing', 'effort', 'EV1', 'subsequently', 'became', 'Norma', 'Rae-like', 'figure', 'cause', 'Where', 'film', 'bit', 'too', 'glib', 'inclusion', 'number', 'green-friendly', 'celebrities', 'who', 'supported', 'cause', 'even', 'getting', 'arrested', 'participation', 'Mexican', 'stand-off', 'GM', 'pending', 'demolition', 'last', '78', 'good', 'Agatha', 'Christie', 'mystery', 'Paine', 'suspected', 'murderers-', 'consumers', 'who', 'were', 'ambivalent', 'resistant', 'new', 'technology', 'oil', 'car', 'companies', 'government', 'CARB', 'are', 'deemed', 'guilty', 'batteries', 'film', 'also', 'strong', 'criticism', 'leveled', 'hydrogen', 'possible', 'alternative', 'energy', 'source', 'epitomized', 'amusing', 'clip', 'Bush', 'being', 'shown', 'how', 'fill', 'up', 'hydrogen-fueled', 'vehicle', 'also', 'guarded', 'note', 'optimism', 'plug-in', 'hybrid', 'seen', 'more', 'viable', 'path', 'development', 'one', 'most', 'valuable', 'extras', 'DVD', 'fifteen-minute', 'short', 'Jump-Starting', 'Future', 'deeper', 'alternatives', 'Also', 'DVD', 'are', 'fifteen', 'minutes', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'understandably', 'excised', 'rather', 'disposable', 'music', 'video', 'band', 'Meeky', 'Rose', 'who', 'performed', 'main', 'theme', 'film']",N/A

It's kind of silly set-up, but I did walk away seeing the importance of cars that run without gasoline, produce no exhaust, and are quiet, yet still drive fast.There was a time when these cars were available to the public, but then they disappeared.  In this documentary, you're given a  list of suspects who caused this to happen.  Those suspects are:-- Car companies, specifically General Motors-- Air Resources Board, specifically Alan Lloyd-- the government-- Consumers-- Batteries and their efficiency and practicality-- Hydrogen fuel cell cars as a better alternativeBy the end of  the  documentary, a verdict of guilty or not guilty is reached for each of these suspects.  One verdict I had trouble  with, though,  was  the guilty verdict for Consumers.  They're  faulted  for being too skeptical,  however,  that's  unfair seeing how  it's actually wise for consumers to be skeptical about fantastic claims, especially when those claims are about a large and expensive product.Had advertisers done a better job convincing consumers  that the electric car is a better alternative, maybe the verdict would've been different.After all, as noted in the documentary, consumers  were  originally  skeptical about  owning a SUV.  They thought SUV's were too big and scary to drive, yet advertisers managed to convince  consumers to own one.  So why not do the same with the electric car?With soaring oil prices, America's entanglement with the Middle East, global warming and smog ruining people's health,  we're told electric cars are needed  now  more than ever.  The documentary ends with hope for electric cars in our future.However, for the electric car to realistically take off again, consumers will need to be reassured that an electric car won't further complicate their lives, which this documentary doesn't go into that deeply.  For example, how much does it cost to own one of these?  How much will this increase my electric bill?  What happens if this car stalls in the middle of nowhere?

The stinging caveat being the LA Times reporter naively held in that miasma of 'true life,' mouthing what in effect would be the 'no conspiracy' line, when he should have been strapped in the chair like Warren Beatty, fighting the brainwashing.  But indoctrination is far more subtle now, isn't it?Even the director falls prey to system thinking, hammering 'global warming' as a plank into his platform to resurrect brilliance from the catacombs of politico-industrial backwash.All the usual suspects are brought to the line-up.  Representatives of those private-jet aficionados panhandling in Washington are raked over the coals with responses worthy of a congressional hearing.  Politicians, like actors they're grateful for any kind of notice, make their bows.  Even the American public is ringed in, to give the film an air of democratic objectivity.Timeliness drips from the film as viewers continue to massage their wallets from the recent spikes in gas prices.  Yet a greater story is being filmed.The viewer sees it in the helplessness of the heros and heroines as they fight for their earth-saving, money-conserving, clean and healthy runabouts.  It shows forth in the hardened faces of the police lines brought in somewhere outside of beautiful downtown Burbank.It resonates in the adumbration of prophetical proclamations of a time when individuality will submit for the greater good.  When common sense will begin to play as radicalism.  When those in power will be fewer in number, yet greater in control.Truth will begin to be an opinion.  Reality will be shaped by those who know better and can explain things with a joke.Like Clinton joking about the electric car to the auto-makers who are grimly squirming in their seats, unable to look anyone in the eye.Is a one-world system all that hard to conceive?Is man evolving to better and greater heights?WKTEC is an important film.  Far too important to be ignored.The film not only chronicles yet one more travesty in modern American history, unwittingly, it documents the direction in which this world is traveling by oil.And that power is ordered.TL Farley,author,When Now Becomes Too Late - The imminent Rapture. {I Thess. 4:14}",5,Closer to The End?,1227830400,"11 28, 2008",2008,3104,"['Who', 'Killed', 'Electric', 'Car', 'title', 'documentary', 'produced', 'people', 'too', 'much', 'time', 'hands', 'place', 'go.A', 'friend', 'dropped', 'dvd', 'library', 'asking', 'view', 'Realizing', 'had', 'lived', 'period', 'late', '80', 'early', '90', 'Southern', 'California', 'when', 'lot', 'noise', 'was', 'being', 'made', 'very', 'subject', 'finally', 'submitted', 'request', 'bowl', 'popcorn.No', 'personal', 'interest', 'had', 'ever', 'brought', 'direct', 'contact', 'controversy', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'quick', 'point', 'out', 'anyone', 'asked', 'had', 'been', 'effort', 'develope', 'electric', 'car', 'nothing', 'importance', 'had', 'ever', 'taken', 'place.Watching', 'own', 'stupidity', 'lack', 'attention', 'dissolving', 'screen', 'uncomfortably', 'settled', 'watch', 'remake', 'Tucker', 'II', 'Drifting', 'scene', 'scene', 'were', 'flashbacks', 'Paralax', 'View', 'stinging', 'caveat', 'being', 'LA', 'Times', 'reporter', 'naively', 'held', 'miasma', ""'true"", 'life', 'mouthing', 'what', 'effect', 'would', 'be', ""'no"", 'conspiracy', 'line', 'when', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'strapped', 'chair', 'Warren', 'Beatty', 'fighting', 'brainwashing', 'indoctrination', 'far', 'more', 'subtle', 'now', ""n't"", 'Even', 'director', 'prey', 'system', 'thinking', 'hammering', ""'global"", 'warming', 'plank', 'platform', 'resurrect', 'brilliance', 'catacombs', 'politico-industrial', 'backwash.All', 'usual', 'suspects', 'are', 'brought', 'line-up', 'Representatives', 'private-jet', 'aficionados', 'panhandling', 'Washington', 'are', 'raked', 'coals', 'responses', 'worthy', 'congressional', 'hearing', 'Politicians', 'actors', ""'re"", 'grateful', 'kind', 'notice', 'make', 'bows', 'Even', 'American', 'public', 'ringed', 'give', 'film', 'air', 'democratic', 'objectivity.Timeliness', 'drips', 'film', 'viewers', 'continue', 'massage', 'wallets', 'recent', 'spikes', 'gas', 'prices', 'greater', 'story', 'being', 'filmed.The', 'viewer', 'helplessness', 'heros', 'heroines', 'fight', 'earth-saving', 'money-conserving', 'clean', 'healthy', 'runabouts', 'forth', 'hardened', 'police', 'lines', 'brought', 'somewhere', 'beautiful', 'downtown', 'Burbank.It', 'adumbration', 'prophetical', 'proclamations', 'time', 'when', 'individuality', 'will', 'submit', 'greater', 'good', 'When', 'common', 'sense', 'will', 'begin', 'play', 'radicalism', 'When', 'power', 'will', 'be', 'fewer', 'number', 'yet', 'greater', 'control.Truth', 'will', 'begin', 'be', 'opinion', 'Reality', 'will', 'be', 'shaped', 'who', 'know', 'better', 'can', 'explain', 'things', 'joke.Like', 'Clinton', 'joking', 'electric', 'car', 'auto-makers', 'who', 'are', 'grimly', 'squirming', 'seats', 'unable', 'look', 'anyone', 'eye.Is', 'one-world', 'system', 'hard', 'conceive', 'Is', 'man', 'evolving', 'better', 'greater', 'heights', 'WKTEC', 'important', 'film', 'Far', 'too', 'important', 'be', 'ignored.The', 'film', 'not', 'only', 'yet', 'one', 'more', 'travesty', 'modern', 'American', 'history', 'unwittingly', 'documents', 'direction', 'world', 'traveling', 'oil.And', 'power', 'ordered.TL', 'Farley', 'author', 'When', 'Now', 'Too', 'Late', 'imminent', 'Rapture', 'Thess', '4:14']",N/A
177574,A1VDA6GS3N714H,1424819547,"Guy Denutte ""A concerned citizen""","[6, 7]","In 1990, the state of California obliged through the Zero Emission Vehicle mandate car manufacturers turning a minimum part of their sales to electric.  General Motors launched their EV-1 to the market in 1996, and a total of 800 vehicles ran the streets of California.  But at the same time, GM lobbied against this mandate, and they won, in 2003, when this mandate was killed.  Immediately afterwards, all those leased electric vehicles were withdrawn.  Even worse : they were all destroyed, shredded to thousands of pieces, as if to eliminate all physical evidence this car ever even really existed...Bush then gave a tax cut of 100.000 USD to anyone buying a Hummer, in order to ""reactivate the economy"".  You have to consider that the Hummer is a car with an efficiency far below the first commercial vehicle ever built, the T Ford.  Oh yeah, I almost forgot, Bush also went to war to restore the oil supply by Iraq.  We must always bear in mind the words of Franklin D. Roosevelt: ""The trouble with this country is that you can't win an election without the oil bloc, and you can't govern with it.""  So, the actual murderer of the electric vehicle is really Big Oil.Although GM eventually built this car, a real beauty, silent, fast, and called by one of the drivers in this documentary ""sexy"", they weren't too fond of it either, since there's virtually no service to be done.  No spare parts can be sold : no oil filters, no gasoline filters, no air filters, no motor parts, no clutch parts, no tailpipe parts, etc.  Even the brakes had never to be serviced on the EV-1 !  When braking, the power was regenerated and used to charge the batteries, so virtually no wear happened.Happily, oil prices have gone wild in recent years, and other car manufacturers began producing prototypes of electric vehicles.  Next year, 2010, will have a lot of electric vehicles becoming commercially available, from a wide range of manufacturers.  So far, from what I've seen, Fiat seems to have the most interesting proposal, with the Phylla, an electric car with an autonomy of 140 to 220 km, depending on the batteries you buy it with.  The most wonderful fact is that you even don't have to plug it in : it recharges with solar panels incorporated in the roof and the doors !",5,How Big Oil obliges us to continue contaminating the environment,1234483200,"02 13, 2009",2009,2270,"['1990', 'state', 'California', 'obliged', 'Zero', 'Emission', 'Vehicle', 'mandate', 'car', 'manufacturers', 'turning', 'minimum', 'part', 'sales', 'electric', 'General', 'Motors', 'launched', 'EV-1', 'market', '1996', 'total', '800', 'vehicles', 'ran', 'streets', 'California', 'same', 'time', 'GM', 'lobbied', 'mandate', 'won', '2003', 'when', 'mandate', 'was', 'killed', 'Immediately', 'afterwards', 'leased', 'electric', 'vehicles', 'were', 'withdrawn', 'Even', 'worse', 'were', 'destroyed', 'shredded', 'thousands', 'pieces', 'eliminate', 'physical', 'evidence', 'car', 'ever', 'even', 'really', 'existed', 'Bush', 'then', 'gave', 'tax', 'cut', '100.000', 'USD', 'anyone', 'buying', 'Hummer', 'order', 'reactivate', 'economy', 'have', 'consider', 'Hummer', 'car', 'efficiency', 'far', 'first', 'commercial', 'vehicle', 'ever', 'built', 'T', 'Ford', 'Oh', 'yeah', 'almost', 'forgot', 'Bush', 'also', 'went', 'war', 'restore', 'oil', 'supply', 'Iraq', 'must', 'always', 'bear', 'mind', 'words', 'Franklin', 'D.', 'Roosevelt', 'trouble', 'country', 'ca', ""n't"", 'win', 'election', 'oil', 'bloc', 'ca', ""n't"", 'govern', 'So', 'actual', 'murderer', 'electric', 'vehicle', 'really', 'Big', 'Oil.Although', 'GM', 'eventually', 'built', 'car', 'real', 'beauty', 'silent', 'fast', 'called', 'one', 'drivers', 'documentary', 'sexy', 'were', ""n't"", 'too', 'fond', 'virtually', 'service', 'be', 'done', 'spare', 'parts', 'can', 'be', 'sold', 'oil', 'filters', 'gasoline', 'filters', 'air', 'filters', 'motor', 'parts', 'clutch', 'parts', 'tailpipe', 'parts', 'etc', 'Even', 'brakes', 'had', 'never', 'be', 'serviced', 'EV-1', 'When', 'braking', 'power', 'was', 'regenerated', 'used', 'charge', 'batteries', 'so', 'virtually', 'wear', 'happened.Happily', 'oil', 'prices', 'have', 'gone', 'wild', 'recent', 'years', 'other', 'car', 'manufacturers', 'began', 'producing', 'prototypes', 'electric', 'vehicles', 'Next', 'year', '2010', 'will', 'have', 'lot', 'electric', 'vehicles', 'becoming', 'commercially', 'available', 'wide', 'range', 'manufacturers', 'So', 'far', 'what', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'Fiat', 'have', 'most', 'interesting', 'proposal', 'Phylla', 'electric', 'car', 'autonomy', '140', '220', 'km', 'depending', 'batteries', 'buy', 'most', 'wonderful', 'fact', 'even', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'plug', 'solar', 'panels', 'incorporated', 'roof', 'doors']",N/A
177575,AEV640MKB3I9J,1424819547,Hank Drake,"[8, 11]","Who Killed the Electric Car is a 2006 documentary which was understandably overshadowed by An Inconvenient Truth.  The film is a damning indictment of corporate groupthink in general and General Motors in particular.  The extent to which GM went to sabotage its own project boggles the mind.  Ironically, as the EV1 was being developed, GM and Ford were also developing gas-electric hybrid technology.  Toyota and Honda, developed their own hybrid technology in response.  By the time they were marketing the Prius, Insight, and other hybrids, American auto makers has dropped their hybrid plans.  Is it any wonder, with this backward thinking, why GM, Ford, and Chrysler are going down the tubes?It is a testament to GM's insecurity that they felt compelled to destroy virtually every EV1 ever produced.  By the time the EV1's were being scrapped, auto industry spokesmen were grasping and straws and telling bald faced lies.  One particular mistruth is that insurance companies would not cover these vehicles.  Not true.  I work for a large auto insurer, and we do cover most electric vehicles.The filmmakers interview a wide range of EV1 enthusiasts.  Even Mel Gibson, not known for his progressive views, comes across as a reasonable, thoughtful person.  Gibson's recounting of the hurdles he had to jump to lease an EV1 is simultaneously amusing and appalling.An ideal companion to An Inconvenient Truth, Who Killed the Electric Car should be viewed by every non-troglodyte.",5,Innovation Squandered,1176422400,"04 13, 2007",2007,1479,"['Who', 'Killed', 'Electric', 'Car', '2006', 'documentary', 'was', 'understandably', 'overshadowed', 'Inconvenient', 'Truth', 'film', 'damning', 'indictment', 'corporate', 'groupthink', 'general', 'General', 'Motors', 'particular', 'extent', 'GM', 'went', 'sabotage', 'own', 'project', 'mind', 'Ironically', 'EV1', 'was', 'being', 'developed', 'GM', 'Ford', 'were', 'also', 'developing', 'gas-electric', 'hybrid', 'technology', 'Toyota', 'Honda', 'developed', 'own', 'hybrid', 'technology', 'response', 'time', 'were', 'marketing', 'Prius', 'Insight', 'other', 'hybrids', 'American', 'auto', 'makers', 'dropped', 'hybrid', 'plans', 'wonder', 'backward', 'thinking', 'why', 'GM', 'Ford', 'Chrysler', 'are', 'going', 'tubes', 'testament', 'GM', 'insecurity', 'felt', 'compelled', 'destroy', 'virtually', 'EV1', 'ever', 'produced', 'time', 'EV1', 'were', 'being', 'scrapped', 'auto', 'industry', 'spokesmen', 'were', 'grasping', 'straws', 'telling', 'bald', 'faced', 'lies', 'One', 'particular', 'mistruth', 'insurance', 'companies', 'would', 'not', 'cover', 'vehicles', 'Not', 'true', 'work', 'large', 'auto', 'insurer', 'do', 'cover', 'most', 'electric', 'vehicles.The', 'filmmakers', 'interview', 'wide', 'range', 'EV1', 'enthusiasts', 'Even', 'Mel', 'Gibson', 'not', 'known', 'progressive', 'views', 'across', 'reasonable', 'thoughtful', 'person', 'Gibson', 'recounting', 'hurdles', 'had', 'jump', 'lease', 'EV1', 'simultaneously', 'amusing', 'appalling.An', 'ideal', 'companion', 'Inconvenient', 'Truth', 'Who', 'Killed', 'Electric', 'Car', 'should', 'be', 'viewed', 'non-troglodyte']",N/A

As I was watching this documentary, I was trying to figure out what some of the main drawbacks were because with any new technology, there are always going to be unforseen problems and concerns.  I do believe that the oil companies and car manufacturers definately have lots to lose in the wide spread sale of electric cars but there are issues with the practicality of these electric cars as well.  For examble... it takes about 8 hours to charge them so you'd have to make sure you don't travel too far without having it fully charged.  From the looks of them, they required a specialized plug for charging, not a standard household plug.All issues aside, we are about to see a re-emirgence of the electric car.  Today, people can have their Priuses modified to become plug-in hybrids.  Both GM and Chevy plan to release fully electric and plug-in electric hybrids as soon as 2010.  It seem as though all of the problems  with the EV1 have been eliminated.  Some have suggested that the electric cars will force us to build more power plants.  From my understanding, they have hybrid solar cars which will be available soon.This is a must watch documentary which gets us thinking about how big businesses run everything and will do everything they can to protect their assets.  After watching this video, you'll understand why the new electric cars will be so expensive.

The energy that can be used to provide motion in the vehicle would be 3,000 Wh/kg of gasoline vs. 200 Wh/kg of lithium cells. This works out to a 15:1 energy to weight ratio. So for every kilogram of gasoline, you would need 15 kilograms of lithium batteries to go the same distance. Twenty gallons of gas weighs about 60 kilograms. To match this energy, you would need 900 kilograms of lithium cells. This ratio is slightly offset by the exhaust, transmission, and other systems which an EV does not require. Furthermore, an electric car does not need to idle and waste energy at a stop sign the way an ICE vehicle does. Irregardless, you still pay a significant penalty for using batteries.The lead-acid batteries used in GM's EV1 had a far lower energy density of only 25 Wh/kg. It doesn't take a genius to see why it failed to catch on, added to the fact that it was ugly as sin. Although the new lithium-powered Tesla Roadster is a great improvement over the EV1, its enormous 6,831 lithium-cell battery still only gets about 120 miles per charge in city driving. It also takes up to four hours to recharge. Worse, its sticker price is a jaw-dropping $100,000.The biggest technical hurdle for electric cars, as it has always been, is battery technology. I would consider buying one once they can give me a range comparable to a gas-powered car. By the way, this documentary is still worth seeing. I feel that it is a bit slanted, but you should watch it anyway, then make up your own mind. 3.5 stars.",4,Who Killed the Electric Car?

Beuchert ""History buff""","[4, 11]","Hollywood is well known for NEVER producing an historically accurate account (about anything) andthis film goes even beyond the nonsense that tinseltown normally cooks up. I had followed the development of GM'sImpact electric car (later renamed the EV-1) all those years after the 70's gas crises, which was its original motivation. The car originally was fitted with lead acid batteries, which were totally impractical. Newly developed hydride batteries became available,and GM fitted the car with them. They were batteries only a battery company could love. Very slow recharging and with small capacity (and still way too heavy) and way too expensive ($39,000 for a 60 mile range battery pack) they doomed any electric of that era. So this is Paine's wonder car : he wonders why people didn't flock to the showrooms. Fact is, the cars were ridiculous as substitutes for what we already had - totally  impractical and ridiculously expensive. Paine blames everybody and everything except the car itself for its demise, which it richly deserved. For that reason, Paine's arguments are beyond silly- they are merely verbal hand grenades tossed hither and yon, plausible only to those who are focused narrowly on emissions, and nothing else (you know, like reality). Unfortunately, the electric car hardly avoids emissions, since it uses electricity, a power source generated by emission producing power plants (something which cannot be avoided by using solar or wind).Paine has acquired a reputation as something of an expert about electric cars, yet there is no evidence, either in his films or his public statements, that he understands what every electric car advocate (beginning with Henry Ford and Thomas Edison around 1914) already knows : battery costs and characteristics (weight, capacity, recharge times) will determine when the electric car replaces our gas powered vehicles.

The market system and profit-motivated corporations will not bring about the kind of long-term public good that is needed in this world.This film is biased - in the way that truth and goodness are biased against lies and evil. The story of the EV1 is a tragedy of American style (dare I say Texas-sized, Mr. Bush) proportions.[Update 4/10/12:]Since I wrote this review my thinking has changed somewhat. I now think that gas cars are not the problem, it's just cars period. Cars and their infrastructure are terribly wasteful of resources. Using them for mass transit is near-insanity. We must get away from burning fossil fuels for energy, yes. Electric cars are somewhat better, but not greatly so. EVs are not going to save the planet - we must make much bigger changes than that.The author ofGreen Illusions: The Dirty Secrets of Clean Energy and the Future of Environmentalism (Our Sustainable Future)changed my mind. This book is not yet published as I write this, but I read a piece by him in the CSM: ""The suburban architecture of fully disengaged homes and megastores, connected by wide streets and highways, has prompted a mass deployment of energy resources that would have been unthinkable just a generation before its formation. It is from within the suburban addiction that Americans grew to understand extreme energy waste as perfectly normal.... Some community groups are saying ""No."" They're showing how concerned citizens are better achieving their environmental objectives by supporting more durable options such as walkable neighborhoods, bicycling infrastructure, carpooling, traffic calming (incorporating physical features to slow or reduce traffic - wider sidewalks, roundabouts, etc.), and comfortable public transit.""

One of their methods was to buy electric car patents... and do nothing with them.U.S. Car Companies - Sabotaged the success of their own (electric) cars to make them appear inefficient so that the government wouldn't force them to make non-emitting vehicles.

177593,A17FLA8HQOFVIG,1424819547,Linda Linguvic,"[4, 7]","The film opens with a funeral.  But it's not a funeral for a person.  It's a public relations event to raise public awareness of the now-defunct electric car, which seemed to be the hope of a nation in the 1990s.  Yes, once upon a time, General Motors did manufacture these cars.  And they were much in demand in sunny California, where fuel emissions create havoc on the health of the people in the state.This is a documentary about one issue.  And as the film continues we see the issue explored again and again and again.  Martin Sheen does the narration and there's a very interesting section narrated by Phyllis Diller about how the electric car appeared throughout automotive history and but how oil became the method of choice for automobile manufacturers.  The most impressive thing to me, however, were the real stories of the people who actually used these vehicles.  Then, when their leases were up, General Motors took them away and destroyed them. Why did this happen?  That's what this film is all about.Electric cars are different from regular cars but can definitely fit into an environmental control program.  They don't go fast and they need to be recharged.  The people who used them drove them short distances to work and back each day.  Then, they recharged them in their garages.  Even with these limitations, people still loved them.  Not only did they keep dangerous emissions from the environment, they also saved trips to the gas station.  Especially now, with gas prices so high, they could be a welcome addition to a household.  However, this can never be.  They stopped being made.  And nobody knows why.The film interviews one person after another.  Especially interesting is the way the vehicle owners have banded together to research exactly what happened to the electric car.  They also hold demonstrations and speak out whenever they can.  I found this all fascinating although I think the film could have been strengthened by some animation explaining exactly how the car worked.

But it actually also exposed the general apathy that allows these problems to continue. As with the electric car, the movie itself did not generate much interest.Notwithstanding, it is a really interesting movie. It ties nicely with the title of ""Who Killed the Electric Car?"" by looking at the suspects which include: Car Companies, Oil Companies, Consumers, Government, the California Air Resources Board (CARB), Battery Technology, and Fuel Cells.The actions of GM in scrapping the electric car and destroying its remnants make it look sinister. And there appears to be a serious conflict of interest for a number of government officials who have had positions in the oil and auto industry.One interesting point in this movie is whether Fuel Cells will be really ever be viable. It raises the question as to whether the hype about Fuel Cells is really a diversion by the auto and oil industries to delay any real progress in developing a battery powered electric car which can effectively compete with gasoline powered cars.The movie questions the motives of the California Air Resources Board in eliminating its Zero Emissions Vehicle mandate, which required 2% of the vehicles sold in California to be emissions free by 1998 and 10% emissions free by 2003. Unbelievably, the Chairman of the California Air Resources Board subsequently became the chairman of the California Fuel Cell Partnership--which makes his actions that ultimately eliminated battery powered electric vehicles appear to be an incredible conflict of interest.This movie is thought provoking and easy to watch.

With regard to subject matter and social relevance, Who Killed the Electric Car easily merits five stars.  However if you're looking for something as an entertaining as well as being informative (a criteria that I like to apply to documentaries), it falls squarely in the middle of the pack during a year of especially worthy documentary efforts (like Wordplay and An Inconvenient TruthIt's the story of the EV1, a vehicle given birth by GM in answer to the state of California's mandate for cleaner air emissions and a consumer backlash against the price of oil.  The EV1 was a spiffy, sleek little sportster that could more than hold it's own with smellier speed demons.  But no sooner did the EV1 hit the roads of California, then gas prices began to plummet, consumers fell in love with SUVs and a conspiracy of convenience between the auto manufacturers, big oil and a big oil-influenced Federal Government led to destruction of the EV1s as their leases expired.Oh, if only it were that simple!  It would be great if you could point a finger at a single villain in this tragedy, but sadly there are many contributors (even the eco-friendly manufacturer of my beloved Toyota Prius hybrid).The point that the filmmakers are trying to make however, is that even though the EV1 no longer travels the roads (a few sit disabled in museums), the technology that it tested and proved is viable, especially when compared to the current governmental darlings of alternative fuels like ethanol and hydrogen fuel cells.  In that respect the movie succeeds admirably.  This is the type of film that you should own and pull off the shelf to make any gas guzzler owners of your acquaintance or relations watch.

177601,A3UPYGJKZ0XTU4,1424819547,mirasreviews,"[6, 7]","In 1990, the state of California passed the Zero Emissions Mandate, which required 10% of cars sold in the state of California to be pollution-free vehicles by 2003. To that end, engineers at General Motors, Ford, Honda, and Toyota took up the challenge to create practical electric cars. And they succeeded. In 1996, electric cars began to appear on California roads. They could go 100 miles on a single charge. They were clean. They were quiet. They cost less to operate than gasoline cars. And they required almost no maintenance. What happened to them? In ""Who Killed the Electric Car?"", director Chris Paine tries to answer that question by examining who created these cars that made the combustion engine look like a relic of the industrial era and why the electric cars -a dream to environmentalists and hurried suburbanites alike- were pulled from the market and destroyed in 2003, taking any hope of freedom from the politics and pollution of gasoline in the foreseeable future along with them.The first half of ""Who Killed the Electric Car?"" follows the history of the electric car and its reluctant entrance onto -and eventual exit from- the market in California through interviews with research engineers, representatives of the California Air Resources Board (CARB), marketers who leased the cars, and celebrities who drove them, with an emphasis on GM's EV1. Once we know the story, the second part of the film addresses the question directly: Who Killed the Electric Car? The suspects are: consumers, batteries, oil companies, car companies, government, CARB, and the hydrogen fuel cell. The film draws conclusions as to which parties are guilty and which are not. Viewers can draw their own conclusions. But it's a sad comment when run-of-the-mill corruption can condemn a culture to antiquated technologies that damage our health, impede economic progress, and keep us tied to substandard products. The great thing about this film is that these pioneering cars demonstrate that we humans have the ingenuity to solve our problems in spades, though we may lack the political will.The DVD (Sony Pictures 2006): There are 10 deleted scenes.

ZALESKI ""m.zaleski""","[6, 11]","Although interesting, this movie is marred by somehistorical inaccuracies (though this is rather asmall point), being a bit fast and loose with someof the technical issues related to electric cars,but most seriously, flawed in its simplisticanalysis of the corporate and governmental politicssurrounding the electric car.  Also, much of the moviesfocuses on the GM abandonment of the electric car marketand goes pretty lightly on the other companies that alsogave up.However, I think anyone who is interested in automobiles,or the auto industry should see this movie.  Viewed withan open mind, you might see some issues raised that makeyou wonder how the automotive press seems to so gliblydismiss this movie.  As an auto enthusiast, I have no desirefor an electric car, as the cars presented here do not meetany of my needs.  Nevertheless, GM's engineers came up witha real world car that made its owners - at least the ones wemeet - pretty happy.  And they deserve credit for that.But this film does raise some questions about what would happento the whole automotive parts/repair pipeline if electricsseriously came on line.This is what I see as the most serious flaw in the movie'sanalysis of who (what) killed the electric car: The CAzero emmission vehicle (ZEV) law said that automakers had to sella certain percentage of ZEVs.  The percentage rose over time.So let's say that in year 1, 2 percent of all cars had to be ZEVs.That would put a cap on the TOTAL number of new cars that couldbe sold in CA, along with locking out several high zoot brandsthat the real movers and shakers like to buy.  Now, if in year 2,the percentage of ZEVs required to be sold rose to 4%, automakerswould have had to sell twice as many electrics just to sell thesame number of cars.  Ultimately, what would happen is that theprices of new and good used cars would skyrocket and the peoplewould vote the whole bunch of elected officials out.  Realizingthis, it was business (politics) as usual that really wins out.If this seems far fetched, check out ""ENRON: The Smartest Guysin the Room"" and see what happens to Gray Davis as artificalelectric shortages cause brownouts and skyrocketing costs.",3,"Interesting, worth seeing, but somewhat flawed review of the facts",1174608000,"03 23, 2007",2007,2181,"['interesting', 'movie', 'marred', 'somehistorical', 'inaccuracies', 'rather', 'asmall', 'point', 'being', 'bit', 'fast', 'loose', 'technical', 'issues', 'related', 'electric', 'cars', 'most', 'seriously', 'flawed', 'simplisticanalysis', 'corporate', 'governmental', 'politicssurrounding', 'electric', 'car', 'Also', 'much', 'moviesfocuses', 'GM', 'abandonment', 'electric', 'car', 'marketand', 'pretty', 'lightly', 'other', 'companies', 'alsogave', 'up.However', 'think', 'anyone', 'who', 'interested', 'automobiles', 'auto', 'industry', 'should', 'see', 'movie', 'Viewed', 'open', 'mind', 'might', 'see', 'issues', 'raised', 'makeyou', 'wonder', 'how', 'automotive', 'press', 'so', 'gliblydismiss', 'movie', 'auto', 'enthusiast', 'have', 'desirefor', 'electric', 'car', 'cars', 'presented', 'here', 'do', 'not', 'meetany', 'needs', 'Nevertheless', 'GM', 'engineers', 'came', 'up', 'witha', 'real', 'world', 'car', 'made', 'owners', 'least', 'ones', 'wemeet', 'pretty', 'happy', 'deserve', 'credit', 'that.But', 'film', 'raise', 'questions', 'what', 'would', 'happento', 'whole', 'automotive', 'parts/repair', 'pipeline', 'electricsseriously', 'came', 'line.This', 'what', 'see', 'most', 'serious', 'flaw', ""movie'sanalysis"", 'who', 'what', 'killed', 'electric', 'car', 'CAzero', 'emmission', 'vehicle', 'ZEV', 'law', 'said', 'automakers', 'had', 'sella', 'certain', 'percentage', 'ZEVs', 'percentage', 'rose', 'time.So', 'let', 'say', 'year', '1', '2', 'percent', 'cars', 'had', 'be', 'ZEVs.That', 'would', 'put', 'cap', 'TOTAL', 'number', 'new', 'cars', 'couldbe', 'sold', 'CA', 'locking', 'out', 'several', 'high', 'zoot', 'real', 'movers', 'shakers', 'buy', 'Now', 'year', '2', 'percentage', 'ZEVs', 'required', 'be', 'sold', 'rose', '4', '%', 'automakerswould', 'have', 'had', 'sell', 'twice', 'as', 'many', 'electrics', 'just', 'sell', 'thesame', 'number', 'cars', 'Ultimately', 'what', 'would', 'happen', 'theprices', 'new', 'good', 'used', 'cars', 'would', 'skyrocket', 'peoplewould', 'vote', 'whole', 'bunch', 'elected', 'officials', 'out', 'Realizingthis', 'was', 'business', 'politics', 'usual', 'really', 'out.If', 'far', 'fetched', 'check', 'ENRON', 'Smartest', 'Guysin', 'Room', 'see', 'what', 'Gray', 'Davis', 'artificalelectric', 'shortages', 'cause', 'brownouts', 'skyrocketing', 'costs']",N/A

Starting with a mock funeral of an EV1 (Electric Vehicle 1), and ending with a video shot of the last EV1 known to exist in the USA (in a museum nonetheless), this movie is part documentary and part editorial.  It tells the story of the EV1, an electric vehicle designed and built by GM in the 1990's and leased to customers in California, partially in response to a new law requiring automakers to sell a certain number of electric vehicles every year.  The story explains the impetus behind this car's rollout, how this played in with regulations put forth by the California Air Resources Board, and how Angelenos reacted to it.  Then comes the great part; how the car was killed, or more precisely, how it was taken of the road one vehicle at the time.  Interwoven in this is the pressure of automakers to reword the California law, and GM's internal politics over the future of the EV1.  Along the way, the federal government under the Bush administration gets involved, and finally the hydrogen fuel cell bandwagon.  Together, the political pressure kills the EV1 program, and other electric vehicle programs throughout the US by all the car companies.This documentary is told thru a combination of interviews with dozens of individuals, and a small amount of narration by Martin Sheen voiced over news clips, archival video footage, and video shot specifically for this movie.  The show ends with a distribution of blame assigned to the oil companies, GM, and the Bush administration.  The only negatives to this movie is its lack of detail on the science side.  Throughout the movie many individuals give testimony on how this science works or does not work, yet it would have been nice for the movie to take 10 - 20 minutes and show the science; specifically how an electric car works, and how it requires less maintenance than a gas-powered car.

We could also use a film about how so many of our communities were designed to make us dependent upon cars and oil.Asphalt Nation: How the Automobile Took Over America and How We Can Take It BackThe End of Suburbia: Oil Depletion and the Collapse of the American DreamWithout much effort, we can subvert the millions of dollars of industry propaganda by simply buying and sharing excellent resources like the DVD of ""Who Killed the Electric Car?"", as well as the DVD ofA Crude Awakening - The Oil Crash(which also features the former CIA director, James Woolsey).For a regular reminder of the sorts of wonderful developments going on in the world of green agriculture, green building, green clothing, green investment and so forth, I highly recommend Plenty Magazine.And for over 500 pages of sustainability and justice stories from around the world, seeWorldchanging: A User's Guide for the 21st Century.Incidentally, the radio host Ed Schultz did a great job of promoting this film.

One point about Hydrogen Fuel Cells that was not discussed is the cost to manufacture a cell large enough to power a car.  The average consumer does not realize a hydrogen fuel cell requires a fair amount of platinum catalyst.  Platinum is worth more than gold ounce for ounce!  Additionally, the industrial capacity required to mass produce fuel cells would require several more plants to be built.  Alternatively, lead-acid battery manufacturing is an old technology with a large industrial base.The only issue the movie did not cover in detail longer than a few seconds was the grassroots push to produce electric cars.

177619,A2EDZH51XHFA9B,1424819547,"Robert Beveridge ""xterminal""","[2, 3]","Who Killed the Electric Car? (Chris Paine, 2006)I should start this review off by saying that I'm probably the least environmentally-conscious person you'd ever want to meet; if no one had already started the Pave the Earth society, I'd have to. In other words, I am not the person Chris Paine had in mind when he set out to make this movie.All that said, I've always been fascinated by the idea of the electric car. Not just for the coolness factor (and the coolness factor is undeniable), but for simple pragmatic reasons-- why spend three bucks a gallon on gas if you can spend sixty cents a ""gallon"" on electricity? (That number is actually quoted in the film, by the by.) The environmental factor doesn't get me, but you appeal to my wallet and I'm all ears.Those of us outside California have never heard the whole story. California was the first state to adopt electric cars on a macro level (and at this writing, they are still the only state to have done so). How many of them were there out there? I don't know the exact number-- Paine and his interviewees never mention it-- but it was a lot more than I thought. I always thought the electric car was something that hobbyists built from kits. That major car companies had produced purely electric vehicles? Nope. No idea. And people were driving them. And liking them. (I take all the protest stuff with a grain of salt. People will protest anything. But the liking them, that means something.) And then, suddenly, they were all recalled. The bulk of the movie is Paine looking at various aspects of where the blame might be placeable. It should be no surprise that most of them deserve it.The question you have to ask yourself is how much of it is straight reporting and how much is conspiracy theory. A lot of it does come off as straight out of the tin hat society, but what separates it from the usual conspiracy babble is that Paine, at least, trusts the viewers to draw their own conclusions. A real wacko won't do that-- they have to spell everything out. Paine just lays it all out and effectively says ""you decide."" Big mark in his favor. Granted, a lot of what he lays out is there for emotional button-pushing, but haven't we all seen enough Hollywood weepies to separate the scenes of people crying at the Electric Car Funeral from the numbers? There's something very disturbing going on here, no matter how slanted the picture that presents it, and it deserves a great deal more research and exposure. Paine has done a very important thing, I think, in bringing this story to a much wider audience than it has previously seen, and I hope it gets some sort of ball rolling. *** ",4,Thought-provoking.,1199318400,"01 3, 2008",2008,2651,"['Who', 'Killed', 'Electric', 'Car', 'Chris', 'Paine', '2006', 'should', 'start', 'review', 'off', 'saying', ""'m"", 'probably', 'least', 'environmentally-conscious', 'person', ""'d"", 'ever', 'want', 'meet', 'one', 'had', 'already', 'started', 'Pave', 'Earth', 'society', ""'d"", 'have', 'other', 'words', 'am', 'not', 'person', 'Chris', 'Paine', 'had', 'mind', 'when', 'set', 'out', 'make', 'movie.All', 'said', ""'ve"", 'always', 'been', 'fascinated', 'idea', 'electric', 'car', 'Not', 'just', 'coolness', 'factor', 'coolness', 'factor', 'undeniable', 'simple', 'pragmatic', 'reasons', 'why', 'spend', 'three', 'bucks', 'gallon', 'gas', 'can', 'spend', 'sixty', 'cents', 'gallon', 'electricity', 'number', 'actually', 'quoted', 'film', 'environmental', 'factor', ""n't"", 'get', 'appeal', 'wallet', ""'m"", 'ears.Those', 'California', 'have', 'never', 'heard', 'whole', 'story', 'California', 'was', 'first', 'state', 'adopt', 'electric', 'cars', 'macro', 'level', 'writing', 'are', 'still', 'only', 'state', 'have', 'done', 'so', 'How', 'many', 'were', 'there', 'there', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'exact', 'number', 'Paine', 'interviewees', 'never', 'mention', 'was', 'lot', 'more', 'thought', 'always', 'thought', 'electric', 'car', 'was', 'something', 'built', 'kits', 'major', 'car', 'companies', 'had', 'produced', 'purely', 'electric', 'vehicles', 'Nope', 'idea', 'people', 'were', 'driving', 'liking', 'take', 'protest', 'stuff', 'grain', 'salt', 'People', 'will', 'protest', 'anything', 'liking', 'something', 'then', 'suddenly', 'were', 'recalled', 'bulk', 'movie', 'Paine', 'looking', 'various', 'aspects', 'where', 'blame', 'might', 'be', 'placeable', 'should', 'be', 'surprise', 'most', 'deserve', 'it.The', 'question', 'have', 'ask', 'how', 'much', 'straight', 'reporting', 'how', 'much', 'conspiracy', 'theory', 'lot', 'come', 'off', 'straight', 'tin', 'hat', 'society', 'what', 'usual', 'conspiracy', 'babble', 'Paine', 'least', 'viewers', 'draw', 'own', 'conclusions', 'real', 'wacko', 'wo', ""n't"", 'do', 'have', 'spell', 'everything', 'out', 'Paine', 'just', 'lays', 'out', 'effectively', 'decide', 'Big', 'mark', 'favor', 'Granted', 'lot', 'what', 'out', 'there', 'emotional', 'button-pushing', 'have', ""n't"", 'seen', 'enough', 'Hollywood', 'weepies', 'separate', 'scenes', 'people', 'crying', 'Electric', 'Car', 'Funeral', 'numbers', 'something', 'very', 'disturbing', 'going', 'here', 'matter', 'how', 'slanted', 'picture', 'great', 'deal', 'more', 'research', 'exposure', 'Paine', 'done', 'very', 'important', 'thing', 'think', 'bringing', 'story', 'much', 'wider', 'audience', 'previously', 'seen', 'hope', 'sort', 'ball', 'rolling', '***']",N/A
177620,A16QODENBJVUI1,1424819547,Robert Moore,"[11, 15]","January 7, 2007 Addition:  I've change the title of my review for a simple reason.  GM, which has taken a public relations beating over this documentary, has announced the development of a new Electric hybrid car called the Volt.  Like the EV-1, it will run exclusively on electricity if your commute is forty miles or less, but unlike the EV-1 will have a small gasoline engine if you need to drive distances longer than that.  It is too early to tell if this is a mere publicity ploy to offset negative press from this documentary or a serious effort.  If the former, GM deserves any public spanking that can be administered.  If the latter, then they deserve credit for providing a competitor to Sony's similar car.  The most promising thing is that the GM car czar Bob Lutz publically acknowledged that GM made a mistake in not going forward with the electric car earlier.  The only hold up in production seems to be the battery.  The lithium battery they want to use has the potential to overheat on charging, resulting in a fire.  But if this does represent a serious effort to provide the public with an electric car, three factors will have played important roles:  1) competition from Toyota, 2) public demand, and 3) the negative publicity generated by this documentary.  More and more, we are seeing the power of documentaries to influence corporate policy.  Although McDonald's is not where you want to go to eat healthy, there is no question that their menu is less harmful to your health than it was when the film SUPERSIZE ME came out.I can't quite give this for-the-most-part excellent documentary my highest rating for two reasons.  First, the title implies that the electric car is dead, whereas even the last few minutes of the film shows that the electric car is still very much alive.  Furthermore, it is likely to be quite important in the future.  Recently even officials at GM, perhaps partly in response to this film, have indicated that they foresee the electric car playing a significant role in the future.  More properly, the title of the film should have been the slightly more restricted ""What Killed the General Motors EV1.""  Second, the film in a sense buries its main point.  Unregulated capitalism is not a good thing.  Those advocating a self-regulating free market have increasingly had it their way the past three decades and the result has been a long string of disasters for the majority of Americans and citizens of other countries.  The evidence for this is so overwhelming and apparent in so many different ways that this really at this point should be beyond debate.  Yet in many ways the debate is only getting started.  I don't have space here to even hint at the broad outlines that a case against unregulated capitalism would take, but it would certainly begin with the stunning increase in economic inequality -- considered either in real income or in wealth -- between the top 2% of Americans contrasted with nearly all the rest.  Real wages have fallen in the past thirty years and the disparity between the very rich and the bottom 60% of Americans (i.e., most of the country) is reaching crisis proportions.  More and more Americans are recognizing the fact that our national economic model is broken and needs to be fixed.  This film highlights only one of the many problems with the current system.Theoretically, free marketers believe in an even playing field that will allow market forces to determine both demands for products and their prices.  In fact, the myth of the self-regulating market has always been at heart both unrealistic and utopian, describing a world not only that doesn't exist, but can never exist.  The fact is that the playing field is never even, never has been even, and never will be.  This is the main point that this film illustrates magnificently.  At heart the reason GM decided to kill the EV1 was the fact that if it had been successful it would have had the potential to dismantle much of the apparatus sustaining the automotive industry.  It would also have endangered the profits of the oil industry.  As the film illustrates, not only would the various oil companies not have been able to sell their gasoline and motor oil, the car companies would not have been able to sell replacement parts.  What the EV1 threatened to do and what the various versions of the electric car and electric hybrid continue to threaten is the fundamental infrastructure of the larger American automotive industry.  It is not surprising that much of the pressure is now deriving from the Japanese.  Unlike the United States, they are actually pursuing industries that will reduce their dependence on foreign oil.  And unless the US federal government puts an embargo on the importation of such technologies, nothing is going to stop them.  The electric hybrid car shown near the end of the film is the sign of things to come, since it can refuel gasoline at any filling station and can recharge its batteries at home.The film also illustrates how corporations can circumvent the public will in an effort to protect their own profits.  As the film shows, there were long waiting lists for the electric car, but instead of delivering the product, they simply failed to make the cars.  And when they did contact the customers on the waiting list, discouraged them from buying by listing the car's shortcomings.  But the public not only wanted the cars, they wanted use of such vehicles to expand.  But GM not only refused to make the cars available, they put inferior technology (i.e., older batteries that limited the range of the vehicles) in them to make them less attractive to consumers.  All of this to get around the California law mandating that a certain percentage of cars be zero emission vehicles.  Furthermore, the cars would have not only have emitted zero pollution (apart from the electrical power required to charge the cars, which even then would have been vastly lower than the pollutants created by combustion engines) but would have helped lower America's dependence on oil in the long run.  Polls have shown Americans overwhelmingly in favor or reduced reliance on Middle Eastern oil.  Actually, polls show Americans overwhelmingly in favor of reducing our reliance on oil regardless of where it is obtained.  But the public will conflicts too starkly with the needs of the oil and auto manufacturing companies.All in all, I tremendously enjoyed this film.  It calls attention to a lamentable incident in recent American history and serves as a cautionary tale to how corporate interests could threaten popular public goals in the future.  Despite the unceasing rhetoric from free marketers in the past few decades, federal regulation and oversight is not a bad thing:  it is both a good and necessary function of government.  In future efforts to bring about public policy that benefits society as a whole, such as reduced pollution, reduced greenhouse gases and a lessened dependence on foreign oil, government needs to play a greater role, else corporate America will simply roll over the people again and again.",4,Could be retitled:  What documentary saved the electric car?,1164240000,"11 23, 2006",2006,7105,"['January',

Vaughn ""I'm boycotting Amazon's...","[2, 2]","ABOUT THE MOVIE: The consumer was one of the groups found guilty for who killed the electric car, and I don't agree with that from personal experience. What I do agree with is the struggle that those who were supporters of the electric cars endured to get them to reach the public. Regardless of the demand, it has to be the manufacturers who will build the product. I learned a few new things from watching this DVD, too. I didn't know about the newer battery that would let hybrid drivers get further, the cars that were smashed down and the struggles with GM (although I'd heard rumors). This is an educational movie that'll probably answer all of the questions that consumers were never quite clear on about how a hybrid car works, why they were so rare and what slowed down the process of making them pop more than those unnecessary hummers. Watching this movie put me right back into hybrid curiosity mode.ABOUT MY OWN STRUGGLE WITH HYBRID CARS: In 2008, I was obsessed with finding out everything I could about hybrid cars, and while watching this movie, I realized I was going through some of the same frustration as the average consumer but from a media standpoint. I couldn't figure out why was it that Black Americans weren't buying hybrid cars when gas had gone up so much that summer. Why aren't rappers rhyming about these ""new"" cars when the hip-hop industry is notorious for bragging about materialism? Why aren't more people who want to spend less on car prices taking advantage of these cars? Where do you fill up the tanks? Where do you plug it in? How does it work? I wasn't seeing any of this information in publications with a niche in the African-American market and I wanted to write about it. I kept hearing statements about ""black people don't drive hybrids,"" ""hybrids are too expensive for black people"" and ""hybrids aren't geared towards black dollars."" I still believed it could be if we were informed. So I did it myself. I talked to the African American Environmentalist Association and went to a car dealership to talk to a car salesman. I was so adamant about proving my point that I interviewed a black car salesman and we drove a black hybrid car and I made sure to ask questions about black auto selling dollars. And still I was shut down by my editor (at a previous job) about why no one would want to read that. While watching this movie and hearing GM, the government and consumers get blamed, I want to go one step further and say the media struggled with getting the word out, too. I don't know if readers should've demanded more information from the media or did the media feel it was a conflict of interest because of car ad dollars, but I know one hand was not helping the other. I ended up publishing those interviews elsewhere since they were shot down from a past employer, but what really struck me was when I wanted to buy a hybrid and was told I was required to pay $500, the waiting list was for 200 and no more could be added and there was no clear date on when people would get their cars. Trust me when I say this movie was no joke and consumers got caught up in the crossfire.",5,Do black people buy electric cars?,1337126400,"05 16, 2012",2012,3131,"['THE', 'MOVIE', 'consumer', 'was', 'one', 'groups', 'found', 'guilty', 'who', 'killed', 'electric', 'car', 'do', ""n't"", 'agree', 'personal', 'experience', 'What', 'do', 'agree', 'struggle', 'who', 'were', 'supporters', 'electric', 'cars', 'endured', 'get', 'reach', 'public', 'Regardless', 'demand', 'be', 'manufacturers', 'who', 'will', 'build', 'product', 'learned', 'few', 'new', 'things', 'watching', 'DVD', 'too', 'did', ""n't"", 'know', 'newer', 'battery', 'would', 'let', 'hybrid', 'drivers', 'get', 'further', 'cars', 'were', 'smashed', 'down', 'struggles', 'GM', ""'d"", 'heard', 'rumors', 'educational', 'movie', ""'ll"", 'probably', 'answer', 'questions', 'consumers', 'were', 'never', 'quite', 'clear', 'how', 'hybrid', 'car', 'works', 'why', 'were', 'so', 'rare', 'what', 'slowed', 'down', 'process', 'making', 'pop', 'more', 'unnecessary', 'hummers', 'Watching', 'movie', 'put', 'right', 'back', 'hybrid', 'curiosity', 'mode.ABOUT', 'MY', 'OWN', 'STRUGGLE', 'WITH', 'HYBRID', 'CARS', '2008', 'was', 'obsessed', 'finding', 'out', 'everything', 'could', 'about', 'hybrid', 'cars', 'watching', 'movie', 'realized', 'was', 'going', 'same', 'frustration', 'average', 'consumer', 'media', 'standpoint', 'could', ""n't"", 'figure', 'out', 'why', 'was', 'Black', 'Americans', 'were', ""n't"", 'buying', 'hybrid', 'cars', 'when', 'gas', 'had', 'gone', 'up', 'so', 'much', 'summer', 'Why', 'are', ""n't"", 'rappers', 'rhyming', 'new', 'cars', 'when', 'hip-hop', 'industry', 'notorious', 'bragging', 'materialism', 'Why', 'are', ""n't"", 'more', 'people', 'who', 'want', 'spend', 'less', 'car', 'prices', 'taking', 'advantage', 'cars', 'Where', 'do', 'fill', 'up', 'tanks', 'Where', 'do', 'plug', 'How', 'work', 'was', ""n't"", 'seeing', 'information', 'publications', 'niche', 'African-American', 'market', 'wanted', 'write', 'kept', 'hearing', 'statements', 'black', 'people', 'do', ""n't"", 'drive', 'hybrids', 'hybrids', 'are', 'too', 'expensive', 'black', 'people', 'hybrids', 'are', ""n't"", 'geared', 'towards', 'black', 'dollars', 'still', 'believed', 'could', 'be', 'were', 'informed', 'did', 'talked', 'African', 'American', 'Environmentalist', 'Association', 'went', 'car', 'dealership', 'talk', 'car', 'salesman', 'was', 'so', 'adamant', 'proving', 'point', 'interviewed', 'black', 'car', 'salesman', 'drove', 'black', 'hybrid', 'car', 'made', 'sure', 'ask', 'questions', 'black', 'auto', 'selling', 'dollars', 'still', 'was', 'shut', 'down', 'editor', 'previous', 'job', 'why', 'one', 'would', 'want', 'read', 'watching', 'movie', 'hearing', 'GM', 'government', 'consumers', 'get', 'blamed', 'want', 'go', 'one', 'step', 'further', 'say', 'media', 'struggled', 'getting', 'word', 'too', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'readers', 'should', ""'ve"", 'demanded', 'more', 'information', 'media', 'did', 'media', 'feel', 'was', 'conflict', 'interest', 'car', 'ad', 'dollars', 'know', 'one', 'hand', 'was', 'not', 'helping', 'other', 'ended', 'up', 'publishing', 'interviews', 'elsewhere', 'were', 'shot', 'down', 'past', 'employer', 'what', 'really', 'struck', 'was', 'when', 'wanted', 'buy', 'hybrid', 'was', 'told', 'was', 'required', 'pay', '500', 'waiting', 'list', 'was', '200', 'more', 'could', 'be', 'added', 'was', 'clear', 'date', 'when', 'people', 'would', 'get', 'cars', 'Trust', 'when', 'say', 'movie', 'was', 'joke', 'consumers', 'got', 'caught', 'up', 'crossfire']",N/A

The film opens up at a cemetery where they perform a mock funeral rites for the electric car who was defeated by politicians and others. The film explores the concept about the electric car and shakes off some myths about it. If anything, this film is enlightening, entertaining, and informative.I got a kick out of the fact that actress Alexandra Paul had an electric car and supported it. If you are fan of the film, &#34;Christine&#34; by Stephen King's novel about a possessed car, you would understand the irony here.

Gas at the gas stations was below $3.00 in this film and now is well close to $4.00 in some states like California.The main reason that I believe electric cars should be reinstated is the lack of pollution in the atmosphere. Electric cars don't have the same emissions that gasoline powered cars do. The documentary explores both sides and leaves nobody blameless as to the death of the electric cars. Everybody including politicians, gas companies, consumers, and even the California Environmental Resources Board failed the electric car.It all comes down to money! The gas companies like Mobil/Exxon make billions of dollars. Without our dependence on gasoline whether foreign or homegrown, we can't go anywhere without it. Sadly, the electric cars came and went without a little group of strong supporters whether celebrities or environmentally conscious citizens. Too bad, we don't have the electric cars as an option. It would be better for our environment overall. I wouldn't be surprised if the gasoline empires kept this documentary out of the public consciousness.

Though the soaring gas prices have indeed caused many of us to take note and become a bit more eco-conscious, when a similar movement began in the 1990's it was a myriad of competing factions that in fact pulled the emergency brake on such a movement.Who Killed the Electric Car is an interesting documentary on the entire electric car life span for conception to production to dismantling in scrap yards just a few years later. The electric car phenomenon that swept the country amongst like minded individuals and in particular celebrity types in a way that perhaps predated the necessity of living a more sustainable life and rather focused on the desire to life in such a way.Thanks to the EV movement that made driving an electric car fashionable and trendy, the demand for EVs began to peak and a push was on to increase production of electric cars to meet the demand that was creeping up ever so quickly.But all of that came to a crashing halt. The film seeks to address some of the possible culprits guilty for killing the electric car. Though certainly no charges of murder could be brought, what certain individuals and organizations did to ensure the rapid demise of the electric car was comparable to stabbing the heart of the electric car movement and ensuring it would never breathe another breath.The movie seeks to point the finger at the different individuals and organizations that killed the electric car movement. There is a spotlight shone upon the gasoline and oil companies just as brightly as there is one cast upon politicians who were more concerned about protecting the interests of Big Oil rather than the consumers' that were buying the EVs interests.However, what is most interesting is the expose that highlights how the automobile manufacturers also had a hand in bringing down the electric car. It is amazing to think that even when a demand was so prevalent for EVs that the automobile industry would bend to outside pressures to ensure that oil dependent vehicles would live on past the EVs.Imagine for a second the manufacturers of the EVs actually seizing back the EVs from the consumers and then shipping them off to be destroyed at a scrap yard. Sound a bit too totalitarian for your liking? Well, the truth is that happened right here in America.The film does a fine job exploring as many different possible avenues for those that could be found guilty for killing the electric car. The documentary is done in such a way that certainly there is a bias shown toward the pro-EV movement and arguments but ample time is devoted to ensuring that both sides of the issue are in fact addressed.Narrated by Martin Sheen, the documentary is well crafted in the sense that there are a lot of different interviews pieced together in a way that is methodical and cogent. Toward the end of the film when the players are identified as being either guilty or not guilty, a sort of mini-trial snapshot is translated to the film well.Who Killed the Electric Car is a very good look at a decision made less than two decades ago that certainly now is having adverse ramifications on both the environment and economy. It would be interesting to learn whether or not had the EVs in fact been invested in and supported to the same level as petroleum dependent vehicles whether or not today we would be so dependent upon oil and so impacted by the fluctuations in the price of the oil we consume.Though there are several parties outlined as being found guilty of killing the electric car, the one main thing to take away is that the parties involved in this senseless killing should to this day be held accountable. And when you are accountable for such an act, you too should be punished.",4,The Killers of the EV Remain Free Today,1215043200,"07 3, 2008",2008,3841,"['Perhaps', 'now', 'more', 'ever', 'become', 'renewed', 'focus', 'finding', 'more', 'sustainable', 'ways', 'live', 'terms', 'energy', 'consumption', 'soaring', 'gas', 'prices', 'have', 'indeed', 'caused', 'many', 'take', 'note', 'become', 'bit', 'more', 'eco-conscious', 'when', 'similar', 'movement', 'began', '1990', 'was', 'myriad', 'competing', 'factions', 'fact', 'pulled', 'emergency', 'brake', 'movement.Who', 'Killed', 'Electric', 'Car', 'interesting', 'documentary', 'entire', 'electric', 'car', 'life', 'span', 'conception', 'production', 'dismantling', 'scrap', 'yards', 'just', 'few', 'years', 'later', 'electric', 'car', 'phenomenon', 'swept', 'country', 'minded', 'individuals', 'particular', 'celebrity', 'types', 'way', 'perhaps', 'predated', 'necessity', 'living', 'more', 'sustainable', 'life', 'rather', 'focused', 'desire', 'life', 'such', 'way.Thanks', 'EV', 'movement', 'made', 'driving', 'electric', 'car', 'fashionable', 'trendy', 'demand', 'EVs', 'began', 'peak', 'push', 'was', 'increase', 'production', 'electric', 'cars', 'meet', 'demand', 'was', 'creeping', 'up', 'ever', 'so', 'quickly.But', 'came', 'crashing', 'halt', 'film', 'address', 'possible', 'culprits', 'guilty', 'killing', 'electric', 'car', 'certainly', 'charges', 'murder', 'could', 'be', 'brought', 'what', 'certain', 'individuals', 'organizations', 'did', 'ensure', 'rapid', 'demise', 'electric', 'car', 'was', 'comparable', 'stabbing', 'heart', 'electric', 'car', 'movement', 'ensuring', 'would', 'never', 'breathe', 'breath.The', 'movie', 'point', 'finger', 'different', 'individuals', 'organizations', 'killed', 'electric', 'car', 'movement', 'spotlight', 'shone', 'gasoline', 'oil', 'companies', 'just', 'as', 'brightly', 'one', 'cast', 'politicians', 'who', 'were', 'more', 'concerned', 'protecting', 'interests', 'Big', 'Oil', 'rather', 'consumers', 'were', 'buying', 'EVs', 'interests.However', 'what', 'most', 'interesting', 'expose', 'how', 'automobile', 'manufacturers', 'also', 'had', 'hand', 'bringing', 'down', 'electric', 'car', 'amazing', 'think', 'even', 'when', 'demand', 'was', 'so', 'prevalent', 'EVs', 'automobile', 'industry', 'would', 'bend', 'outside', 'pressures', 'ensure', 'oil', 'dependent', 'vehicles', 'would', 'live', 'EVs.Imagine', 'second', 'manufacturers', 'EVs', 'actually', 'seizing', 'back', 'EVs', 'consumers', 'then', 'shipping', 'off', 'be', 'destroyed', 'scrap', 'yard', 'Sound', 'bit', 'too', 'totalitarian', 'liking', 'Well', 'truth', 'happened', 'right', 'here', 'America.The', 'film', 'fine', 'job', 'exploring', 'many', 'different', 'possible', 'avenues', 'could', 'be', 'found', 'guilty', 'killing', 'electric', 'car', 'documentary', 'done', 'such', 'way', 'certainly', 'bias', 'shown', 'pro-EV', 'movement', 'arguments', 'ample', 'time', 'devoted', 'ensuring', 'sides', 'issue', 'are', 'fact', 'addressed.Narrated', 'Martin', 'Sheen', 'documentary', 'well', 'crafted', 'sense', 'are', 'lot', 'different', 'interviews', 'pieced', 'together', 'way', 'methodical', 'cogent', 'end', 'film', 'when', 'players', 'are', 'identified', 'being', 'guilty', 'not', 'guilty', 'sort', 'mini-trial', 'snapshot', 'translated', 'film', 'Killed', 'Electric', 'Car', 'very', 'good', 'look', 'decision', 'made', 'less', 'two', 'decades', 'certainly', 'now', 'having', 'adverse', 'ramifications', 'environment', 'economy', 'would', 'be', 'interesting', 'learn', 'not', 'had', 'EVs', 'fact', 'been', 'invested', 'supported', 'same', 'level', 'petroleum', 'dependent', 'vehicles', 'not', 'today', 'would', 'be', 'so', 'dependent', 'oil', 'so', 'impacted', 'fluctuations', 'price', 'oil', 'consume.Though', 'are', 'several', 'parties', 'outlined', 'being', 'found', 'guilty', 'killing', 'electric', 'car', 'one', 'main', 'thing', 'take', 'away', 'parties', 'involved', 'senseless', 'killing', 'should', 'day', 'be', 'held', 'accountable', 'when', 'are', 'accountable', 'such', 'act', 'too', 'should', 'be', 'punished']",N/A
177631,AJYGQV81FSFE2,1424819547,Timothy P. Scanlon,"[5, 7]","I recall when this film turned up at one of the indie theatres I'm inclined to go to. I must have seen the trailer or something as I thought it was another Tom Hanks diatribe. Not that I disagree with him usually, but I get tired of show biz diatribes. I figured it was hyperbole, claiming something was an issue when it was a non-issue, etc. But now that I got to see it, I appreciate the film for what it's worth: a documentary and an expose.It seems California has some of the worst air in the US. The state's equivalent of the EPA was considering a requirement that a certain number of the vehicles in the state be zero emissions. The car manufacturers came through with EV vehicles, electric, therefore no emissions.Now, keeping them in perspective, they were electric, therefore had limited range. But they were stylish, fast and quiet and there WAS, obviously, a market for them. One of those repeatedly testifying throughtout the film was a young woman who sold them.The documentary covers the development of the vehicle, then its destruction, then looks at the ""conspiracy"" theories and who may have been responsible for the demise of the EV? Was it the auto manufacturers? The oil companies? Consumers? The hydrogen cell industry? The quality of the batteries?To make a long story short, all were responsible except for the batteries. There has been some discussion that the original batteries were inadequate, but then a later, better, more durable battery was provided which made the vehicle more viable. And, yes, the consumer was responsible to a degree. If s/he wanted an SUV, an Humvee, or some other gas guzzler, such an EV may not be too popular.Interesting, an organization claiming to be an environmental group lobbied vigorously against proposed air quality law. They listed as among their endorsers many companies thought to be more environmentally conscious. Some investigators called the alleged endorers and it turned out they had never endorsed defeat of the law. Then investigators looked into the ""environmental"" lobbyist and found it was funded almost completely by the oil companies.What was most interesting too is how thorough the auto manufacturers with the desctruction of the EVs once the state EPA had done away with their zero emission requirement. They took the vehicles back and, investigators found after some searching, that they'd crushed them, or, in the case of one, shredded them! It was obvious that those manufacturers had done their best to see to the complete demise of the EVs, not just falling interest.I was amazed, frankly, that I never even heard of the EVs when they were available. The film made that clear too, that the manufacturers go out of their way to market whatever they want to succeed, but seemed to put conscious effort to prevent the success of the EVs.One person interviewed toward the end of the film showed the aftermarket products required to maintain an internal combustion vehicle, e.g., oil, filters, etc., and concluded that lack of the sale of such products would have discouraged auto companies from too actively marketing the EVs.Overall, I recommend the film. It gives you a lot to think about, especially how the companies control our behavior, even by seeing as to what's available, and, even more, what isn't.",5,More interesting...and objective...than I thought,1197936000,"12 18, 2007",2007,3292,"['recall', 'when', 'film', 'turned', 'up', 'one', 'indie', 'theatres', ""'m"", 'inclined', 'go', 'must', 'have', 'seen', 'trailer', 'something', 'thought', 'was', 'Tom', 'Hanks', 'diatribe', 'Not', 'disagree', 'usually', 'get', 'tired', 'show', 'biz', 'diatribes', 'figured', 'was', 'hyperbole', 'claiming', 'something', 'was', 'issue', 'when', 'was', 'non-issue', 'etc', 'now', 'got', 'see', 'appreciate', 'film', 'what', 'worth', 'documentary', 'expose.It', 'California', 'worst', 'air', 'US', 'state', 'equivalent', 'EPA', 'was', 'considering', 'requirement', 'certain', 'number', 'vehicles', 'state', 'be', 'zero', 'emissions', 'car', 'manufacturers', 'came', 'EV', 'vehicles', 'electric', 'therefore', 'emissions.Now', 'keeping', 'perspective', 'were', 'electric', 'therefore', 'had', 'limited', 'range', 'were', 'stylish', 'fast', 'quiet', 'WAS', 'obviously', 'market', 'One', 'repeatedly', 'testifying', 'film', 'was', 'young', 'woman', 'who', 'sold', 'them.The', 'documentary', 'covers', 'development', 'vehicle', 'then', 'destruction', 'then', 'conspiracy', 'theories', 'who', 'may', 'have', 'been', 'responsible', 'demise', 'EV', 'Was', 'auto', 'manufacturers', 'oil', 'companies', 'Consumers', 'hydrogen', 'cell', 'industry', 'quality', 'batteries', 'make', 'long', 'story', 'short', 'were', 'responsible', 'batteries', 'been', 'discussion', 'original', 'batteries', 'were', 'inadequate', 'then', 'later', 'better', 'more', 'durable', 'battery', 'was', 'provided', 'made', 'vehicle', 'more', 'viable', 'yes', 'consumer', 'was', 'responsible', 'degree', 's/he', 'wanted', 'SUV', 'Humvee', 'other', 'gas', 'guzzler', 'EV', 'may', 'not', 'be', 'too', 'popular.Interesting', 'organization', 'claiming', 'be', 'environmental', 'group', 'lobbied', 'vigorously', 'proposed', 'air', 'quality', 'law', 'listed', 'endorsers', 'many', 'companies', 'thought', 'be', 'more', 'environmentally', 'conscious', 'investigators', 'called', 'alleged', 'endorers', 'turned', 'out', 'had', 'never', 'endorsed', 'defeat', 'law', 'Then', 'investigators', 'looked', 'environmental', 'lobbyist', 'found', 'was', 'funded', 'almost', 'completely', 'oil', 'companies.What', 'was', 'most', 'interesting', 'too', 'how', 'auto', 'manufacturers', 'desctruction', 'EVs', 'once', 'state', 'EPA', 'had', 'done', 'away', 'zero', 'emission', 'requirement', 'took', 'vehicles', 'back', 'investigators', 'found', 'searching', ""'d"", 'crushed', 'case', 'one', 'shredded', 'was', 'obvious', 'manufacturers', 'had', 'done', 'best', 'see', 'complete', 'demise', 'EVs', 'not', 'just', 'falling', 'interest.I', 'was', 'amazed', 'frankly', 'never', 'even', 'heard', 'EVs', 'when', 'were', 'available', 'film', 'made', 'clear', 'too', 'manufacturers', 'go', 'way', 'market', 'want', 'succeed', 'seemed', 'put', 'conscious', 'effort', 'prevent', 'success', 'EVs.One', 'person', 'interviewed', 'end', 'film', 'showed', 'aftermarket', 'products', 'required', 'maintain', 'internal', 'combustion', 'vehicle', 'e.g.', 'oil', 'filters', 'etc.', 'concluded', 'lack', 'sale', 'such', 'products', 'would', 'have', 'discouraged', 'auto', 'companies', 'too', 'actively', 'marketing', 'EVs.Overall', 'recommend', 'film', 'lot', 'think', 'especially', 'how', 'companies', 'control', 'behavior', 'even', 'seeing', 'what', 'available', 'even', 'more', 'what', ""n't""]",N/A

On the federal level, the Republican sweep in 1994, with a repudiation of 25 years of environmental legislation.2. The reelection of California Governor Pete Wilson in 1994, and Republicans unseating Democrat governors nationwide, and Republicans making huge gains in Congress in Nov 1994.  This sea change may have been a factor in reducing the auto industry's motivation to push the EV. That political revolution is missing in explaining the death of the EV in California, where the government villians are made out to be G. W. Bush, Cheney, and Rice.3. We humans are nearly incapable of analyzing economic factors-- but we always emphasize political factors. This mental shortcoming has to do with the Availability Bias, from cognitive psychology:  We overestimate factors easy to imagine or remember-- like political figures we don't like-- and ignore factors difficult to imagine or remember-- like anything to do with economics.  So when GM cuts funding in 1992 for the Impact, everyone, including director Chris Paine, screams out that there is a giant conspiracy by bad guys in Oil.  BUT few recognize that when a company has a loss of a billion dollars, they need to cut back somewhere.4. Paine does not mention Japanese electric cars.  All four major Japanese carmakers had cars to show at the Anaheim California December 1994-- EV Symposium 12. Mazda had an EV Miata. In France, residents were paying for the privilege of test driving 50 Peugeot-Citroen ZX and 105 model prototypes.  If Big Oil, Autos, and the U.S. Gov killed the GM EV, who killed the French and Japanese EVs?5. Which brings up the Big Red Cars in Southern California.  Did Standard Oil and GM and B. F. Goodrich destroy Henry Huntington's Pacific Electric, the world's best electric car system, with its more than 1000 miles of standard gauge track? Or rather than a giant conspiracy, is the fault in the hands of my mother and father and thousands like them who destroyed the Pacific Electric-- Why?  Because they purchased a shiny new 1949 Nash, instead of spending that money on tickets to ride the Red Cars.We blame the ""greedy"" oil companies, but we don't think about tens of thousands of Southern Californians ready to buy that status symbol, their own auto, after years of rationing during and after World War II.

All in all, This movie was informative, I would have never have guessed that much of a following, although again it is slanted from that perspective, but it honestly seems that their may have been enough interest.  And Why crush the cars? makes no sense, let the people buy them. Servicing them would not have cost the company that much, their weren't that many out their anyway.  Just blundered all the way around. Oh well, the promise of a hybrid adaptation is cool.

177642,A3PM9DMVYG9HDK,1424819547,"Yuni ""nut_stud""","[3, 4]","I watched this documentary as the Big Three were grovelling for government bailout in the wake of the economic downturn this year (2008) and find the sheer greed and short-sightedness of the American auto industry to be disgusting and deplorable. As another reviewer mentioned, GM completely squandered a golden opportunity to be the forerunner in the field of zero-emission vehicles. Instead, they decided to succumb to the easy, profitable (in the short term) way out by quashing the electric car and forcing SUVs and gigantor trucks down the American consumers' throats.This documentary follows the almost-guaranteed-success of the electric car in California before GM took some huuuge missteps. The film includes many perspectives, such as the people who got to lease the electric cars, the California Clean Air Group and representatives of the Auto industry, etc. It is truly disturbing that many politicians and businessmen can lie through their teeth so seamlessly that they almost look like they believe in what they were lying about.It's unfortunate that this documentary reminded us that big business will only take actions that benefit big business, even if it's only for the short-term, and that the consumers' real desires and needs are secondary to that. It is also somewhat scary to think that maybe the government and the politicians who are supposed to be representing the people and fighting for the rights of the people, might be colluding with big business.It is a very thought-provoking film and is a bit of a conspiracy theory. It is very educational and it made me even more cynical about big business and government. However, a number of people who were interviewed towards the end of the film raised hopes in me that the future may not be that bleak.

177643,A3EOVXI1VZIHUQ,1424819547,"Z. Freeman ""Zach""","[4, 5]","In a time when documentaries are flooding the video store, this one really stands out. It's clear that it was made with passion. This documentary clearly lays out the case for the ""murder"" of the electric car. Using extensive archival footage and interviews with electric car activists, automobile industry professionals, scientists, and politicians from both sides of the spectrum, this documentary is eye-opening and never lets up.Whether electric cars would be ""better"" for the environment is not really the issue here. The issue being addressed is why the automobile industry fought so hard against a measure in California to reduce car emissions by 2010. Who Killed the Electric Car? examines the auto industry and the power of the oil industry.The conclusions drawn from the movie are fairly valid: ultimately, we're all responsible for the demise of the electric car. Big oil wanted to protect its investments, auto industry didn't want to be told what kind of cars to make, consumers weren't enticed by an electric automobile when they could have a gas-guzzling Hummer, and politicians wanted to please their supporters (oil and automobile companies).The movie ends on a hopeful note about current technologies and advances being made today. It also addresses the decline of GM in the wake of Toyota and Honda coming out with so many hybrids that Americans are now buying. This documentary will keep you interested the whole time and will (hopefully) open your eyes to the politically charged world we live in.",5,The kind of quality documentary that started the documentary craze,1168473600,"01 11, 2007",2007,1518,"['time', 'when', 'documentaries', 'are', 'flooding', 'video', 'store', 'one', 'really', 'out', 'clear', 'was', 'made', 'passion', 'documentary', 'clearly', 'out', 'case', 'murder', 'electric', 'car', 'Using', 'extensive', 'archival', 'footage', 'interviews', 'electric', 'car', 'activists', 'automobile', 'industry', 'professionals', 'scientists', 'politicians', 'sides', 'spectrum', 'documentary', 'eye-opening', 'never', 'up.Whether', 'electric', 'cars', 'would', 'be', 'better', 'environment', 'not', 'really', 'issue', 'here', 'issue', 'being', 'addressed', 'why', 'automobile', 'industry', 'fought', 'so', 'hard', 'measure', 'California', 'reduce', 'car', 'emissions', '2010.', 'Who', 'Killed', 'Electric', 'Car', 'auto', 'industry', 'power', 'oil', 'industry.The', 'conclusions', 'drawn', 'movie', 'are', 'fairly', 'valid', 'ultimately', ""'re"", 'responsible', 'demise', 'electric', 'car', 'Big', 'oil', 'wanted', 'protect', 'investments', 'auto', 'industry', 'did', ""n't"", 'want', 'be', 'told', 'what', 'kind', 'cars', 'make', 'consumers', 'were', ""n't"", 'enticed', 'electric', 'automobile', 'when', 'could', 'have', 'gas-guzzling', 'Hummer', 'politicians', 'wanted', 'please', 'supporters', 'oil', 'automobile', 'companies', '.The', 'movie', 'ends', 'hopeful', 'note', 'current', 'technologies', 'advances', 'being', 'made', 'today', 'also', 'decline', 'GM', 'wake', 'Toyota', 'Honda', 'coming', 'out', 'so', 'many', 'hybrids', 'Americans', 'are', 'now', 'buying', 'documentary', 'will', 'keep', 'interested', 'whole', 'time', 'will', 'hopefully', 'open', 'eyes', 'politically', 'charged', 'world', 'live']",N/A
