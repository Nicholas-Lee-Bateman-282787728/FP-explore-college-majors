196430,A1PASRZ81DY9C,6300145786,Austin Somlo,"[1, 1]","Viewed: 4/14Rate: 74/14: I was a big fan of the film Rad, having seen it multiple of times during the 80's. Arguably, it's easily the best BMX picture ever made because of the dearth of competition. It has been nearly 25 years since I saw it last, and Rad is a very hard picture to obtain. So, I had to buy the videotape and relive the memories. Of course, the BMX scenes are spectacular as they were back then. That opinion will never change forever. However, Rad is certainly a very cheesy film because the older I get, the less naive I am, so I realize that. It's comical when the mother gets very angry at Cru for skipping the SATs for some BMX race that can potentially net him one hundred grand. I mean, SATs can be made up at any time, and it's no great loss if Cru decides not to go to college. He can learn a vocational trade such as fixing bikes and running a bike shop. No shame in that. How funny that whenever I see the word Mongoose on a bike, it brings out a negative feeling out of me which still persists to this day. Rad is responsible for that. Well, look at Bart Conner, the blonde BMX champion. He is the famous gymnast that won Olympic and World gold medals and is currently married to Nadia Comaneci, a much more uber-famous gymnast. All in all, Rad is always a great viewing that will never get old.",4,It's Rad.,1397952000,"04 20, 2014",2014,1323,"['Viewed', '4/14Rate', '74/14', 'was', 'big', 'fan', 'film', 'Rad', 'having', 'seen', 'multiple', 'times', '80', 'Arguably', 'easily', 'best', 'BMX', 'picture', 'ever', 'made', 'dearth', 'competition', 'been', 'nearly', '25', 'years', 'saw', 'last', 'Rad', 'very', 'hard', 'picture', 'obtain', 'So', 'had', 'buy', 'videotape', 'relive', 'memories', 'course', 'BMX', 'scenes', 'are', 'spectacular', 'were', 'back', 'then', 'opinion', 'will', 'never', 'change', 'forever', 'However', 'Rad', 'certainly', 'very', 'cheesy', 'film', 'older', 'get', 'less', 'naive', 'am', 'realize', 'comical', 'when', 'mother', 'very', 'angry', 'Cru', 'skipping', 'SATs', 'BMX', 'race', 'can', 'potentially', 'net', 'one', 'hundred', 'grand', 'mean', 'SATs', 'can', 'be', 'made', 'up', 'time', 'great', 'loss', 'Cru', 'not', 'go', 'college', 'can', 'learn', 'vocational', 'trade', 'such', 'fixing', 'bikes', 'running', 'bike', 'shop', 'shame', 'How', 'funny', 'whenever', 'see', 'word', 'Mongoose', 'bike', 'out', 'negative', 'feeling', 'still', 'day', 'Rad', 'responsible', 'Well', 'look', 'Bart', 'Conner', 'blonde', 'BMX', 'champion', 'famous', 'gymnast', 'won', 'Olympic', 'World', 'gold', 'medals', 'currently', 'married', 'Nadia', 'Comaneci', 'much', 'more', 'uber-famous', 'gymnast', 'Rad', 'always', 'great', 'viewing', 'will', 'never', 'get', 'old']",Rad VHS

196434,A2K7CVIVEWDOVN,6300145786,brian tunick,"[9, 9]","I was able to find a `Rad' DVD online, which I'm fairly certain is a pirated copy (subtle hints, such as the DVD itself still saying `Maxell').  Fortunately, I am not a DVD collector by any means.  Unfortunately, it is not possible to rent this gem of a film anywhere.As a veteran BMXer and a thirty-something who still enjoys doing very stupid things on bikes, I absolutely love this movie.  I'm pretty sure some of my older and more faded scars are a direct result of attempting to emulate the great Cru Jones, a feat that was impossible for me at age 12, and will be at this age as well.  The refreshing thing is that back when `Rad' was made, moviegoers were less concerned about how much a production company might be sued for.  They did not need to show that Cru wore a helmet, in fact, while learning to back flip (incorrectly called `Airwalk' by a young and ever so compelling Lori Laughlin), we see Cru wearing a hockey goalie mask.  My fellow freeriders (a style of mountain biking) can attest to the fact that this would be pure suicide.  Law suits?  None that I remember.So that is what makes `Rad' so rad?  A 90 minute trip back to slightly simpler time.  A day when surfing was done with a board and not a computer.  A time when computers were more about tic-tac-toe (and thermal global nuclear war) than about work.  A time when kids could truly believe they had a shot at winning the big race.  A time when kids were more interested in winning the big race than they were in landing a dream-sponsorship.  A time when violence was not needed to compensate for a worthless plot.  Best yet, a time when a girl like Lori Laughlin could be wooed by the sharing of an ice cream cone.  Remember, she wouldn't be able to call you until she got home or came across a payphone.I suppose this has become more of a rant than a review, but the feeling of being a kid again is more what `Rad' is about than a cheesy storyline and some impressive (even by today's standards) biking.  In the interest of review, I should make note that the movie scores EXTREMELY low on the 80's cheese factor, especially for a sports movie.  No montage, no evil jock named `Stalin', very little in the way of the hero's internal struggle with (un)popularity.  Ok, maybe the Mongoose team's choreographed yet impromptu dance routine (especially with twin men in matching sleeveless suits) was a bit much.  Point is, the movie itself is good; you'll spend (a LOT) more time reminiscing and enjoying the story than you will laughing at bright shoelaces and parachute pants.Whether you are a child of the 80's or a child now, `Rad' will make you smile.  Just don't try too hard to learn the freestyle tricks from the movie.  I doubt the producer/distributor could be held liable for your injuries 25 years after the fact.",5,Still Have Scars From Trying to Ride Like Cru,1175731200,"04 5, 2007",2007,2801,"['was', 'able', 'find', 'Rad', 'DVD', 'online', ""'m"", 'fairly', 'certain', 'pirated', 'copy', 'subtle', 'hints', 'such', 'DVD', 'still', 'saying', 'Maxell', 'Fortunately', 'am', 'not', 'DVD', 'collector', 'means', 'Unfortunately', 'not', 'possible', 'rent', 'gem', 'film', 'veteran', 'BMXer', 'thirty-something', 'who', 'still', 'doing', 'very', 'stupid', 'things', 'bikes', 'absolutely', 'love', 'movie', ""'m"", 'pretty', 'sure', 'older', 'more', 'faded', 'scars', 'are', 'direct', 'result', 'attempting', 'emulate', 'great', 'Cru', 'Jones', 'feat', 'was', 'impossible', 'age', '12', 'will', 'be', 'age', 'as', 'well', 'refreshing', 'thing', 'back', 'when', 'Rad', 'was', 'made', 'moviegoers', 'were', 'less', 'concerned', 'how', 'much', 'production', 'company', 'might', 'be', 'sued', 'did', 'not', 'need', 'show', 'Cru', 'wore', 'helmet', 'fact', 'learning', 'back', 'flip', 'incorrectly', 'called', 'Airwalk', 'young', 'ever', 'so', 'compelling', 'Lori', 'Laughlin', 'see', 'Cru', 'wearing', 'hockey', 'goalie', 'mask', 'fellow', 'freeriders', 'style', 'mountain', 'biking', 'can', 'attest', 'fact', 'would', 'be', 'pure', 'suicide', 'Law', 'suits', 'None', 'remember.So', 'what', 'Rad', 'so', 'rad', '90', 'minute', 'trip', 'back', 'slightly', 'simpler', 'time', 'day', 'when', 'surfing', 'was', 'done', 'board', 'not', 'computer', 'time', 'when', 'computers', 'were', 'more', 'tic-tac-toe', 'thermal', 'global', 'nuclear', 'war', 'about', 'work', 'time', 'when', 'kids', 'could', 'truly', 'believe', 'had', 'shot', 'winning', 'big', 'race', 'time', 'when', 'kids', 'were', 'more', 'interested', 'winning', 'big', 'race', 'were', 'landing', 'dream-sponsorship', 'time', 'when', 'violence', 'was', 'not', 'needed', 'compensate', 'worthless', 'plot', 'Best', 'yet', 'time', 'when', 'girl', 'Lori', 'Laughlin', 'could', 'be', 'wooed', 'sharing', 'ice', 'cream', 'cone', 'Remember', 'would', ""n't"", 'be', 'able', 'call', 'got', 'home', 'came', 'payphone.I', 'suppose', 'become', 'more', 'rant', 'review', 'feeling', 'being', 'kid', 'again', 'more', 'what', 'Rad', 'cheesy', 'storyline', 'impressive', 'even', 'today', 'standards', 'biking', 'interest', 'review', 'should', 'make', 'note', 'movie', 'EXTREMELY', 'low', '80', 'cheese', 'factor', 'especially', 'sports', 'movie', 'montage', 'evil', 'jock', 'named', 'Stalin', 'very', 'little', 'way', 'hero', 'internal', 'struggle', 'un', 'popularity', 'Ok', 'maybe', 'Mongoose', 'team', 'choreographed', 'yet', 'impromptu', 'dance', 'routine', 'especially', 'twin', 'men', 'matching', 'sleeveless', 'suits', 'was', 'bit', 'much', 'Point', 'movie', 'good', ""'ll"", 'spend', 'LOT', 'more', 'time', 'reminiscing', 'enjoying', 'story', 'will', 'laughing', 'bright', 'shoelaces', 'parachute', 'pants.Whether', 'are', 'child', '80', 'child', 'now', 'Rad', 'will', 'make', 'smile', 'Just', 'do', ""n't"", 'try', 'too', 'hard', 'learn', 'freestyle', 'tricks', 'movie', 'doubt', 'producer/distributor', 'could', 'be', 'held', 'liable', 'injuries', '25', 'years', 'fact']",Rad VHS

196447,A2UJTJ2HQTSMO4,6300145786,TheJKDguy,"[109, 111]","RAD is the ultimate BMX movie. It is a movie about the underdog struggling to get to the top, or in Cru Jones case, the ability to prove himself. The action on bicycles in this movie started a freestyle frenzy all over the world. Guy's like Eddie Fiola and Martin Aparijo played a significant part in the film. When I first saw this movie I begged my parents to buy me a freestyle bike to do the tricks I saw in the film, that was in 86 and I still consider BMX to be an important part of my life, thanks to this film. Bmx did not fade out, look at DAve Mirra, if anything it has certainly grew. This movie is hard to find and it is something I treasure very much. I strongly encourage you to express your interest in this film and the release of it on DVD.",5,RAD movie,1038441600,"11 28, 2002",2002,757,"['RAD', 'ultimate', 'BMX', 'movie', 'movie', 'underdog', 'struggling', 'get', 'top', 'Cru', 'Jones', 'case', 'ability', 'prove', 'action', 'bicycles', 'movie', 'started', 'freestyle', 'frenzy', 'world', 'Guy', 'Eddie', 'Fiola', 'Martin', 'Aparijo', 'played', 'significant', 'part', 'film', 'When', 'first', 'saw', 'movie', 'begged', 'parents', 'buy', 'freestyle', 'bike', 'do', 'tricks', 'saw', 'film', 'was', '86', 'still', 'consider', 'BMX', 'be', 'important', 'part', 'life', 'thanks', 'film', 'Bmx', 'did', 'not', 'fade', 'out', 'look', 'DAve', 'Mirra', 'anything', 'certainly', 'grew', 'movie', 'hard', 'find', 'something', 'treasure', 'very', 'much', 'strongly', 'encourage', 'express', 'interest', 'film', 'release', 'DVD']",Rad VHS
