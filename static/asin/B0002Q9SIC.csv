Once again, both Close and Walken break our stereo-types of them and give fine performances as the stoic, yet ""deeply-devoted"" couple.  A few cheesy moments by supporting cast, but not a big detraction.The one major flaw to this DVD - the transfer job is really, really bad.  It's so bad you're better off saving a few dollars and getting on VHS.  It's a shame because some of the Northport. Maine location shots are quite beautiful.",3,"Good sequel, nice family film",1127520000,"09 24, 2005",2005,540,"['enjoyed', 'first', 'Hallmark', 'Sarah', 'Plain', 'Tall', 'sequel', 'Skylark', 'not', 'disappointment', 'Once', 'again', 'Close', 'Walken', 'break', 'stereo-types', 'give', 'fine', 'performances', 'stoic', 'yet', 'deeply-devoted', 'couple', 'few', 'cheesy', 'moments', 'supporting', 'cast', 'not', 'big', 'detraction.The', 'one', 'major', 'flaw', 'DVD', 'transfer', 'job', 'really', 'really', 'bad', 'so', 'bad', ""'re"", 'better', 'off', 'saving', 'few', 'dollars', 'getting', 'VHS', 'shame', 'Northport', 'Maine', 'location', 'shots', 'are', 'quite', 'beautiful']","Skylark: The Sequel To Sarah, Plain And Tall"
