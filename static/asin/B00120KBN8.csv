1133815,A3HQAPXAJV7PRX,B00120KBN8,Diane Kistner,"[3, 4]","This is a long review that includes another Joyce Vedral DVD, her building bone workout with weights. I hope those who are trying to get back into exercising and getting in shape after a long hiatus will find it useful.I returned to Joyce Vedral 15 years (and +75 lbs.) after I'd first fell in love with her 12-minute Workout. (I have never looked better in my life!) I first got the Bone Building DVD and book, but I waited to begin any workouts until I got the Walking one. It's been a real relief to me because, first, Joyce is about my age so I can see that it is possible for me to ""get there"" and, second, because Joyce's funkiness and occasional klutziness and counting goofs put me enough at ease that I feel like it's okay not to be perfect and I can laugh about it. I can't tell you how far that goes in keeping me motivated to keep working out.My body is nowhere near in good shape, and I've been pretty chronically ill, so I've been putting off exercising out of fatigue and for fear of injuring myself. So I made these simple commitments to myself:1. I'll put on my exercise shoes/clothes and show up at my computer (on which I watch the DVD) not later than 10 a.m. each morning, seven days a week.2. I will work out for half an hour; more if I feel like it later (the Walking DVD is an hour), but that's it for now. (My first priority is making this a habit, getting addicted to doing it every day.)3. I will WATCH the workout if I don't feel like doing it, imagining myself going through the motions. (Usually what it means when I tell myself ""I don't feel like it"" is that I just don't want to spend the time doing it--what I feel like has nothing to do with it. So if I make myself spend the time anyway, if I really DON'T feel like it, I can just sit there doing imaginal rehearsal [google it]. But I have to mentally go through the motions to help build the habit of doing it.) In almost two weeks, I have not sat there once because the time goes far more quickly when I'm up and at it!4. If I have to skip a day for any reason, I will make up that day the next day, no matter what, or (preferably) anticipate skipping and double-up the day before. (I just deliberately tried that to see how it would go, and I was able to do both the Walking and Bone Building workouts one right after the other with only a little rest time in between. But I don't intend to make skipping a habit.)So here's my routine for my first two weeks (I broke in with weights 0-1-2 for the Bone Building workouts, and will up them next week to the ""starting"" 1-2-3):M-W-F Walking with Joyce (half the workout, building up strength and aiming for the full workout later)T-Th-Sat-Sun Bone Building Workouts 1/2/1/2I use an Exercise ball instead of a weight bench for the few Bone Building exercises that require lying on the bench, because I was using the excuse of not being able to afford a bench to not exercise. I just put my upper back on the ball and rock back some, with my knees bent and feet on the floor to stabilize, and it works great. Then I sit on the ball in front of my computer when I'm done with the workout to read my email!I haven't yet taken my measurements and weight for the second week, but after my first week of the above lighter schedule, I'd ALREADY lost inches and two pounds, even without doing any kind of dieting and not even doing the workouts with all the weights or (with the Walking one) for the whole time. And I NEVER lose two pounds in a week, even if I'm strenuously dieting. The best thing is that I FEEL so much better! Energetic! Needless to say, I am very encouraged.All this said, I'd recommend those who are badly out of shape to start with the Walking video. The Big Band (second) portion of that DVD goes through some of the same body movements for different body parts as her weight-lifting routines, just without the weights, so if you need to break in or can't afford the weights yet, you'll at least be doing something. If an hour of aerobic activity is just more than you can possibly do, you can alternate the Latin and Big Band portions every other day until you are fit enough to combine them. (Or, as Joyce recommends, do the whole hour-long workout but drop out and work back in as you can if it's too much for you.) I like the Bone Building workout for the weight portions because it's easily accomplished and works out your whole body in a very systematic way, but check out some of Joyce's other offerings, too.",4,Perfect for people like me who aren't,1235001600,"02 19, 2009",2009,4464,"['long', 'review', 'Joyce', 'Vedral', 'DVD', 'building', 'bone', 'workout', 'weights', 'hope', 'who', 'are', 'trying', 'get', 'back', 'exercising', 'getting', 'shape', 'long', 'hiatus', 'will', 'find', 'useful.I', 'returned', 'Joyce', 'Vedral', '15', 'years', '+75', 'lbs', ""'d"", 'first', 'fell', 'love', '12-minute', 'Workout', 'have', 'never', 'looked', 'better', 'life', 'first', 'got', 'Bone', 'Building', 'DVD', 'book', 'waited', 'begin', 'workouts', 'got', 'Walking', 'one', 'been', 'real', 'relief', 'first', 'Joyce', 'age', 'so', 'can', 'see', 'possible', 'get', 'there', 'second', 'Joyce', 'funkiness', 'occasional', 'klutziness', 'counting', 'goofs', 'put', 'enough', 'ease', 'feel', 'okay', 'not', 'be', 'perfect', 'can', 'laugh', 'ca', ""n't"", 'tell', 'how', 'far', 'keeping', 'motivated', 'keep', 'working', 'body', 'nowhere', 'good', 'shape', ""'ve"", 'been', 'pretty', 'chronically', 'ill', 'so', ""'ve"", 'been', 'putting', 'off', 'exercising', 'fatigue', 'fear', 'injuring', 'made', 'simple', 'commitments', 'myself:1', ""'ll"", 'put', 'exercise', 'shoes/clothes', 'show', 'up', 'computer', 'watch', 'DVD', 'not', 'later', '10', 'a.m.', 'morning', 'seven', 'days', 'week.2', 'will', 'work', 'out', 'hour', 'more', 'feel', 'later', 'Walking', 'DVD', 'hour', 'now', 'first', 'priority', 'making', 'habit', 'getting', 'addicted', 'doing', 'day.', '3', 'will', 'WATCH', 'workout', 'do', ""n't"", 'feel', 'doing', 'imagining', 'going', 'motions', 'Usually', 'what', 'when', 'tell', 'do', ""n't"", 'feel', 'just', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'spend', 'time', 'doing', 'what', 'feel', 'nothing', 'do', 'make', 'spend', 'time', 'anyway', 'really', 'DO', ""N'T"", 'feel', 'can', 'just', 'sit', 'there', 'doing', 'imaginal', 'rehearsal', '[', 'google', 'have', 'mentally', 'go', 'motions', 'help', 'build', 'habit', 'doing', 'almost', 'two', 'weeks', 'have', 'not', 'sat', 'there', 'once', 'time', 'far', 'more', 'quickly', 'when', ""'m"", 'up', '4', 'have', 'skip', 'day', 'reason', 'will', 'make', 'up', 'day', 'next', 'day', 'matter', 'what', 'preferably', 'anticipate', 'skipping', 'double-up', 'day', 'just', 'deliberately', 'tried', 'see', 'how', 'would', 'go', 'was', 'able', 'do', 'Walking', 'Bone', 'Building', 'one', 'right', 'other', 'only', 'little', 'rest', 'time', 'do', ""n't"", 'intend', 'make', 'skipping', 'habit', 'here', 'routine', 'first', 'two', 'weeks', 'broke', 'weights', '0-1-2', 'Bone', 'Building', 'workouts', 'will', 'up', 'next', 'week', 'starting', '1-2-3', 'M-W-F', 'Walking', 'Joyce', 'workout', 'building', 'up', 'strength', 'aiming', 'full', 'workout', 'later', 'T-Th-Sat-Sun', 'Bone', 'Building', 'Workouts', '1/2/1/2I', 'use', 'Exercise', 'ball', 'instead', 'weight', 'bench', 'few', 'Bone', 'Building', 'require', 'lying', 'bench', 'was', 'using', 'excuse', 'not', 'being', 'able', 'afford', 'bench', 'not', 'exercise', 'just', 'put', 'upper', 'back', 'ball', 'rock', 'back', 'knees', 'bent', 'feet', 'floor', 'stabilize', 'great', 'Then', 'sit', 'ball', 'front', 'computer', 'when', ""'m"", 'done', 'workout', 'read', 'email', 'have', ""n't"", 'yet', 'taken', 'measurements', 'weight', 'second', 'week', 'first', 'week', 'above', 'lighter', 'schedule', ""'d"", 'ALREADY', 'lost', 'inches', 'two', 'pounds', 'even', 'doing', 'kind', 'dieting', 'not', 'even', 'doing', 'workouts', 'weights', 'Walking', 'one', 'whole', 'time', 'NEVER', 'lose', 'two', 'pounds', 'week', 'even', ""'m"", 'strenuously', 'dieting', 'best', 'thing', 'FEEL', 'so', 'much', 'better', 'Energetic', 'Needless', 'say', 'am', 'very', 'encouraged.All', 'said', ""'d"", 'recommend', 'who', 'are', 'badly', 'shape', 'start', 'Walking', 'video', 'Big', 'Band', 'second', 'portion', 'DVD', 'same', 'body', 'movements', 'different', 'body', 'parts', 'weight-lifting', 'routines', 'just', 'weights', 'so', 'need', 'break', 'ca', ""n't"", 'afford', 'weights', 'yet', ""'ll"", 'least', 'be', 'doing', 'something', 'hour', 'aerobic', 'activity', 'just', 'more', 'can', 'possibly', 'do', 'can', 'alternate', 'Latin', 'Big', 'Band', 'portions', 'other', 'day', 'are', 'fit', 'enough', 'combine', 'Joyce', 'do', 'whole', 'hour-long', 'workout', 'drop', 'out', 'work', 'back', 'can', 'too', 'much', 'like', 'Bone', 'Building', 'workout', 'weight', 'portions', 'easily', 'accomplished', 'out', 'whole', 'body', 'very', 'systematic', 'way', 'check', 'out', 'Joyce', 'other', 'offerings', 'too']",Walk With Joyce Vedral - Low Impact Walking Workout

1133820,A1352XXHOGVYWT,B00120KBN8,"Ms. Mary S. Massung ""melodic wind""","[13, 13]","I first learned about Joyce Vedral 5 years ago (age 57) after my open lung biopsy.  Having narrowly escaped death from low level formaldehyde exposure, I was told I would need to be a LEAN MUSCLE MACHINE if I desired any quality of life!  However, no one (not even rehab) could tell me how to accomplish this.  I discovered DYNAMIC TENSION by JV in a bookstore and then located her website.  At that time, I was unable to do even 1 week of weight-training (even with NO weights) without having to recuperate for hours in bed!  Yet, when I emailed Joyce and asked for her assistance, she developed a workout plan that allowed me to GRADUALLY increase my capacity to restore atrophied LM! Now I am able to do ALL her weight training programs using 3#,5#,8# hand weights!  I have also lost about 12% body fat in the past 5 years!When I saw this new DVD, I was interested but concerned.  I still have lung disease (pulmonary fibrosis) with only about 60% 02 diffusion (due to the damage done by the formaldehyde).  This means that any form of cardio that takes my HR above about 65% of max is out of the question.  Most low impact walking dvds are focused on getting the HR as high as possible!  This means I cannot utilize them.  I finally could no longer resist and bought this JV dvd and do not regret it!  When I did it this morning, I was amazed to discover that she had developed a low impact dance program that worked the SMALL muscles in the legs as well as the hips.  Since she does not program the arms into the dance routine (encourages the dancer to move arms naturally), I was able to incorporate hula and taiji arm movements!  My legs were only able to handle about 20 minutes of this dvd but I used it as a warm-up for JV ""JUST ARMS"" program and then followed the JUST ARMS with JV stretching program.  It was a perfect combo!If you are looking for an intense aerobic dance program focused on taking your HR to its maximum, this program is NOT what you want.  However, if you would like to work the small muscles of your legs and hips while taking your HR into the moderate cardio range, this program is excellent.  I would strongly recommend it for those who would like to ENJOY dancing for fun the way we did 50 years ago!",5,Works the leg muscles with very small movements!,1219276800,"08 21, 2008",2008,2235,"['first', 'learned', 'Joyce', 'Vedral', '5', 'years', 'ago', 'age', '57', 'open', 'lung', 'biopsy', 'Having', 'narrowly', 'escaped', 'death', 'low', 'level', 'formaldehyde', 'exposure', 'was', 'told', 'would', 'need', 'be', 'LEAN', 'MUSCLE', 'MACHINE', 'desired', 'quality', 'life', 'However', 'one', 'not', 'even', 'rehab', 'could', 'tell', 'how', 'accomplish', 'discovered', 'DYNAMIC', 'TENSION', 'JV', 'bookstore', 'then', 'located', 'website', 'time', 'was', 'unable', 'do', 'even', '1', 'week', 'weight-training', 'even', 'NO', 'weights', 'having', 'recuperate', 'hours', 'bed', 'Yet', 'when', 'emailed', 'Joyce', 'asked', 'assistance', 'developed', 'workout', 'plan', 'allowed', 'GRADUALLY', 'increase', 'capacity', 'restore', 'atrophied', 'LM', 'Now', 'am', 'able', 'do', 'weight', 'training', 'programs', 'using', '3', ',5', ',8', 'hand', 'weights', 'have', 'also', 'lost', 'about', '12', '%', 'body', 'fat', 'past', '5', 'years', 'When', 'saw', 'new', 'DVD', 'was', 'interested', 'concerned', 'still', 'have', 'lung', 'disease', 'pulmonary', 'fibrosis', 'only', '60', '%', '02', 'diffusion', 'due', 'damage', 'done', 'formaldehyde', 'form', 'cardio', 'HR', 'about', '65', '%', 'max', 'question', 'Most', 'low', 'impact', 'walking', 'dvds', 'are', 'focused', 'getting', 'HR', 'as', 'high', 'possible', 'can', 'not', 'utilize', 'finally', 'could', 'no', 'longer', 'resist', 'bought', 'JV', 'dvd', 'do', 'not', 'regret', 'When', 'did', 'morning', 'was', 'amazed', 'discover', 'had', 'developed', 'low', 'impact', 'dance', 'program', 'worked', 'SMALL', 'muscles', 'legs', 'as', 'well', 'hips', 'not', 'program', 'arms', 'dance', 'routine', 'dancer', 'move', 'arms', 'naturally', 'was', 'able', 'incorporate', 'hula', 'taiji', 'arm', 'movements', 'legs', 'were', 'only', 'able', 'handle', '20', 'minutes', 'dvd', 'used', 'warm-up', 'JV', 'JUST', 'ARMS', 'program', 'then', 'followed', 'JUST', 'ARMS', 'JV', 'stretching', 'program', 'was', 'perfect', 'combo', 'are', 'looking', 'intense', 'aerobic', 'dance', 'program', 'focused', 'taking', 'HR', 'maximum', 'program', 'NOT', 'what', 'want', 'However', 'would', 'like', 'work', 'small', 'muscles', 'legs', 'hips', 'taking', 'HR', 'moderate', 'cardio', 'range', 'program', 'excellent', 'would', 'strongly', 'recommend', 'who', 'would', 'like', 'ENJOY', 'dancing', 'fun', 'way', 'did', '50', 'years', 'ago']",Walk With Joyce Vedral - Low Impact Walking Workout
