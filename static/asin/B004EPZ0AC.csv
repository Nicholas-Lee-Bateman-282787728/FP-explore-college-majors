1404172,AAZRWLML88IZK,B004EPZ0AC,A kids review,"[0, 15]","Back in 2006, WB had a hit with Happy Feet, an animated film about an emperor penguin named Mumble who couldn't sing worth a lick, but who could tap dance his tail off. Fast forward five years, and the inevitable sequel, Happy Feet Two, hit theaters last November. This time around, Mumble is all grown up with a kid of his own, Erik, who refuses to dance like his papa and runs away, only to meet Sven, a unique penguin who can fly. When the entire population of emperor penguins is trapped by an iceberg, Mumble must bring all his friends together to save the day and win back his son's respect. Unfortunately, while the first film was worth  watching and took home the Oscar for Best Animated Film, I wasn't too thrilled with Happy Feet Two, its is narrative noisy and incoherent, even if its animation is expectedly top notch. It's not terrible, but it won't be taking home any awards either.",1,Happy Feet Two,1331596800,"03 13, 2012",2012,896,"['Back', '2006', 'WB', 'had', 'hit', 'Happy', 'Feet', 'animated', 'film', 'emperor', 'penguin', 'named', 'Mumble', 'who', 'could', ""n't"", 'sing', 'lick', 'who', 'could', 'tap', 'dance', 'tail', 'Fast', 'forward', 'five', 'years', 'inevitable', 'sequel', 'Happy', 'Feet', 'Two', 'hit', 'theaters', 'last', 'November', 'time', 'around', 'Mumble', 'grown', 'up', 'kid', 'own', 'Erik', 'who', 'dance', 'papa', 'away', 'only', 'meet', 'Sven', 'unique', 'penguin', 'who', 'can', 'fly', 'When', 'entire', 'population', 'emperor', 'penguins', 'trapped', 'iceberg', 'Mumble', 'must', 'bring', 'friends', 'together', 'save', 'day', 'win', 'back', 'son', 'respect', 'Unfortunately', 'first', 'film', 'was', 'worth', 'watching', 'took', 'home', 'Oscar', 'Best', 'Animated', 'Film', 'was', ""n't"", 'too', 'thrilled', 'Happy', 'Feet', 'Two', 'narrative', 'noisy', 'incoherent', 'even', 'animation', 'expectedly', 'top', 'notch', 'not', 'terrible', 'wo', ""n't"", 'be', 'taking', 'home', 'awards']",N/A

Mumble is grown and has a young one named Eric,an immensely shy little penguin, who like his father, has trouble expressing himself. Despite his parents encouragement,his one attempt causes an embarrassing moment. When Ramon tries to lend support, he is blown off and on his way back to Adelieland finds he has company when Erik follows allow with two friends. Mumble follows and proceeds to try to get the young ones to return. It is here that Erik meets Sven, a charismatic Puffin from the far North, who met Lovelace aboard a ship and believes him to be a penguin who can fly and who teaches Erik that whatever he wills is his. At that moment,an earthquake shakes the area, pushing a huge iceberg ahead of itself and when the penguins get back to Emperorland,they discover the iceberg has blocked the group inside a deep bowl with no way out. Mumble then tries to enlist what help he can as he strives to help however he can. Lovelace tries to attract the help of the aliens and they do come, but can't stay because a storm drives them away. The Adelies do their best to help by fishing until the storm freezes the ice. It is by dancing that Mumble has figured a way to free the Emperors when he and the Adelies shake the snow against the berg, but it isn't enough and he must enlist the aid of the Elephant Seals and Erik discovers he can sing and does so to persuade the stubborn seals to help. Together, they manage to break the ice to free the Emperors. Bill and Will Krill in the meantime,in their journey of self discovery and to lead the swarm to safer waters also help inadvertantly to break the berg because they believe the dancing means something. The movie does have its drawbacks, the Krills seem a bit disjointed and it flows a bit unevenly, but beyond that, it was a fairly straight story with great music and good characters.

1404189,A14Z0Q1DU6CBJJ,B004EPZ0AC,Chris Kennison,"[14, 19]","""Happy Feet 2"" or the sequel to the animated musical for kids is absolutely beautiful. From the intricate fibers of hairs to the glowing jellyfish and the delicate wrinkles of nature escalating into giant land moving earthquakes, everything is like an i-max penguin nature film. ""Happy Feet"" was a surprise hit in 2006, and honestly, I was very surprised. A movie about a little penguin named Mumble, voiced by Elijah Wood (Lord of the Rings), who likes to dance and is treated as an outcast because he can't stop tapping his feet, was a hit at the box office. His fellow penguins love to sing though, they just hadn't keened into the dancing thing.In the sequel, Mumbles is the father, and the penguins of the emperor penguin community are now keen on the dancing, along with the singing. Mumbles son Erik, voiced by Ava Acres, sort of runs along the same course as Mumbles did in the first movie. Embarrassed by an incident on his first attempt to dance, he runs away with two of his friends to find himself. Erik's dilemma isn't dancing, but flying. He wants to fly and he's given false hope by a bird posing as a penguin named Sven.The movie may start out on a similar course as the original, but it eventually turns into something completely different, in many ways. ""Happy Feet 2"" is less comedy and musical and more drama. Sure, there's singing and dancing, but nowhere near as much as the first movie. That being said, the finale's catchy rendition of Queen's ""Under Pressure"" was the best part of the film. Much of the middle of the film is bogged down with dramatic moments and slow moving scenes. As silly as I think dancing, rapping penguins can be and are, the middle of the movie could have used more choreographed penguins breaking and shaking like they were Usher or Michael Jackson.Robin Williams, Brad Pitt, Matt Damon and Pink also lend their voice talents to ""Happy Feet 2"", a movie that has its moments, including the finale, but for the most part it's slow moving and less interesting than most animated movies these days. The animated movie genre sort of shot through the roof over the past few years with movies like, ""Up"", ""Toy Story 3"", ""Coraline"", ""Tangled"", ""Despicable Me"" and ""Megamind"".

It is what it is - more of the same boring and un-entertaining garbage without trying to hide its agenda this time around.Like the first one, skip this attempt at trying to subvert your kids into the environmentalist, liberal, statist corrupt mode of thinking that this country (with the lead tyrant Obama leading the way) seems to be going down.Ok, liberals, flame me all you want.

Mumbles (Voiced by Elijah Wood of `Lord of the Rings') is back - all grown up and now a father of the adorable Erik (voiced by the talented newcomer Ava Acres) and because of a natural iceberg `disaster' the entire Empire Penguins are cut off from their food supply.  Erik and Mumbles are separate from their mother (Mumbles wife), Gloria (Voiced by the pop star Pink) and the rest of the flock.Strangely enough, the dancing plays a very keen role in the solving of the movies major issue, but I got the impression that Millers intent was to give lessons of courage, self-confidence, perseverance and faith in the ability of oneself - with in the plot of two story lines. One story being a family trying to get back together and the other story is between two independent Krills (tiny shrimp-like creatures) learning that they don't necessarily have to leave home to be an individual.Will the Krill (Voiced by Brad Pitt of `Benjamin Buttons') and Bill the Krill (Voiced by Matt Damon of the `Borne' films) have a hysterical romp and exploration of the world outside of the swarm. Learning that you still can be individual amongst your home, family and friends.  Also back for the film is the ever love crazed Ramon and the team leader of the Empires neighboring penguins Lovelace (both wildly preformed by Robin Williams od ""Mrs Doubtfire', `Aladdin'). Also we are introduced to  a new `penguin' the Mighty Sven (Voiced by the amazing voice of Hank Azaria of `The Birdcage', `The Simpsons', `The Smurfs') who has a really big secret!  And back again is the leader of the Empire Penguins Noah the Elder (Hugo Weaving of `The Matrix', `Lord of the Rings') who guides the entire population of penguins to trust Mumbles and his plans to save the entire emprire!The music is amazing just like the first film and contains a couple over really well done remakes of Queen's `Under Pressure' and `We are the Champions' - but the story doesn't hold my interests as much as it's predecessor did. Little Erik however is amazingly cute and sentimental and has this vocal Lament that he sings for his father that turns the `bad' sea walruses around and `save the day'. The choreography is impressive for animated mammals and birds....and the arctic snow and soundtrack are impressive too!I don't know if kids would get the story, but they certainly would get all the sight gags, ice sliding, deep sea fishing and amazing 3-D color effects that make the movie at least visually interesting for everyone watch. Not to mention the toe tapping music.

1404230,AHF97M45JFCB,B004EPZ0AC,ONENEO,"[0, 2]","I've got to admit, the first Happy Feet took me by surprise.  Penguins- been there done that.  Musicals- been there, don't need to do that again.  Environmentalism agendas - am there, hate that!  Yet still the film left me surprised for its ability to tell a moving, charming tale of the interaction between humanity and nature.  The characters were easy to care about; the tension was real and the pacing was flawless.  Naturally when I heard a sequel had been made in 2011 that featured a majority of the same vocal talent (with some powerhouse additions), had $130-million budged (up $30-mil over the first one) and was again written & directed by George Miller, I was naturally interested in continuing with the tale.I suppose I should start with the good news: This isn't a copy/paste rehash of the first film.  The bad news: This isn't a copy/paste rehash of the first film.  While it's true this one probably looked decent on paper (swooping panoramic shots of masses of dancing penguins, near photo-realistic textures and animal models, a new secondary story thread following a pair of existentially obsessed krill and so on), the problem this time around has everything to do with pacing and plot structure but more on that in a bit.The film comes in at a runtime of 100-minutes and wears a PG rating for some animated hijinks, little tension and mild rude humor.  The cast is pretty tight again (though slightly different this time around): Elijah Wood returns as Mumble, P!nk replaces the late Brittany Murphy as Gloria, Robin Williams is back pulling double duty as Ramon/ Lovelace, and Hugo Weaving returns as the village elder.  Mumble's parents (Memphis played by Hugh Jackman and Norma Jean/ Nicole Kidman) are nowhere to be found this time but Brad Pitt and Matt Damon were brought on board as Will and Bill the Krill respectively.The story, or what passes for one here, opens with our main couple having birthed a young penguin named Erik, who, like his father before him, doesn't seem to have the natural gift for singing.  Unlike his pops, however, Erik lacks to rhythm to tap dance his way into hero-status.  Faced with childhood humiliation and parental crises of a confidence-less kid, the story begins to look a little predictable.However things quickly take a turn for the bizarre when little Erik and his pals venture off to the neighboring community of Adelie penguins where they encounter The Mighty Sven, a Tufted Puffin (bird) apparently mistaken as a flying penguin by the Adelies.  Dispensing generic advice by the boatload through a bit of an over-the-top accent by Hank Azaria, Sven becomes Erik's new role model (not to mention convinces many a penguin that the ability to fly is simply a matter of believing in themselves).  Amidst all this we follow two krill who leave the safety and security of the only swarm they've ever known to discover the vast world beyond.Long story short- Erik discovers that even though he can't dance or fly, he can achieve greatness by believing in himself right? Wrong!  The real core of the story here works off the premise that a massive iceberg crashes into the ice floe home of the emperor penguins, trapping the lot of them in a valley.  This time the story is a rescue operation rather than a tale of character growth; and there's nothing wrong with that when done correctly.The trouble here is the pacing is pretty messy.  Disasters just keep unfolding out of nowhere only to be overcome just in time for the next one.  Never is there a sense of a strong backstory or valuable lesson present so much as a successive collection of sweeping scenes.  The singing/ dancing element is certainly more stale (and overused) this time around as well.The environmentalist cues oft-complained about in the first film are back, though admittedly not quite so ""in your face"" as say Lovelace with a 6-pack holder cutting off his oxygen, prepare for a fair share of global warming references, segments of oil spills and even some odd live-footage splices of turkeys being stuffed and chickens rotating on a rotisserie.  However, and to the film's credit, they do try to redeem mankind by depicting us as trying to help build a way out for the stranded penguins as well as cleaning up the oil-soaked animals.In all, Happy Feet Two meanders around and pokes at some pretty interesting concepts but never really flushes any of them out by the film's conclusion.  Perhaps its biggest crime however happens to be that it never establishes the type of connection that makes you really concerned for the characters.  Watchable for sure, and kids will likely be entertained by the beautiful visuals and dancing, but it's the nuances adults will notice that keep it from filling the happy shoes of the original.",3,The

1404234,A39W3263A9HCMN,B004EPZ0AC,"Renfield ""Up the Irons""","[3, 10]","-Warning: this review is laden with spoilers-Somewhere around the 30 minute mark of Happy Feet Two, there's a scene where Gloria, played by Alecia ""Pink"" Moore in lieu of the late Brittany Murphy, sings to her scared baby penguin named Erik a song called ""Bridge of Light"", while he appears trapped on an upper glacier. The lyrics seem to be a hippie anthem about how all you need is love, and how if the world had everyone love each other, and... Well, that, the world wouldn't be a so bad place, like, ya know? At that point, their peace and love causes the northern lights to start. This is where the first thing that popped up in my mind was ""people who thought the first movie was too preachy should best steer clear of THIS.""It only seemed possible from the success of the first movie that a sequel would be released. I mean, after all, despite the fact that it left audiences divided, it became popular and made tons of bucks at the box office. And since Brittany Murphy died, things further went to hell for this sequel. Despite all that... It managed to get made and released... And not much else.I'll admit I loved the first movie. I can understand why it would divide audiences- not everyone favours a global warming message, but I liked it, it had great music, it was super cute, and I absolutely loved it.I was in favour of the inevitable sequel that followed. Tonight I finally saw the sequel... And, it was a mess.If anything, the best way to describe this movie would be rushed. I still find it hard to believe that this movie took 5 years to make... This kind of ""plot"" could have been scraped up in a week, not even, for me. I feel as if they probably felt rushed to find a Brittany Murphy replacement and go from there, to rush the film out.However, there is a fair amount to love in this film. Obviously, I did give the movie a 5/10, so there's a lot to love, right? For one, the charming look is still here. The look has vastly improved from the first movie evidently. The animation looks far better, and the IMAX 3D complimented the graphics perfectly. Every single flake of snow, hair, drop of water can be seen, it's absolutely amazing. In addition, the voice work is admirable too- Matt Damon and Brad Pitt as the skrill, Robin Williams as Lovelace, Hank Azaria as Sven (probably the highlight of the film), Elijah Wood as Mumble, etc.There are a lot of funny moments in the film too, I won't lie. I loved the brief shout outs to the first movie, as well as the ""Loney Goatherd"" yodel to scare the birds away. I will also admit, I LOVED Under Pressure, it was AMAZING. and how it was in tune to the snow falling, was even greater.However, unfortunately it isn't enough to make up for... Um... The rest of this movie.No memorable numbers except for Under Pressure. The first movie had Boogie Wonderland and Somebody to Love. Those were awesome! And all the worse is that it starts off so well with the medley. It makes you believe the film will be just as good as the first. Too bad the film scraps that promise right away.What was the plot?! The movie can't even decide what it was about, which is even bad in the first 40 minutes. At first you think it's going to be a story along the same lines of the first movie, about a youngling in search of his inner dance. Then all of a sudden... It's about global warming... Oh, wait, we must introduce Sven, the flying penguin! Oh, now were trapped in their home land! And the skrill! Who were they and why were they in the movie?! They had no point at all!!!...which marks the perfect point to segue into the film's biggest issue: the movie moves at such a glacial pace (no pun intended), since 3/4 of the film are set in the homeland. This made the movie feel longer than it was, for reasons I cannot put my finger on. I mean, global warming is an issue that is important to be touched upon. However, the film just stays there, and it doesn't work. It ruins what could been a great film.In short, I wish I could love this movie. But... There's too much of too little. Whereas the first movie was a marvel in terms of everything, this film is cute and... cute. I love cute things. I need more than just cute, though. I need enjoyability to go with it. And while this film isn't bad at all, I can't recommend it, for reasons stated above.OVERALL: 5/10THE GOOD: Gorgeously rendered and animated, Happy Feet Two stays cute and delivers on the dancing and cuteness.THE BAD: Cuteness can't make up for its indecisive screenplay, lack of memorable numbers and characters void of emotional connectability.",3,"2.5 stars- The Penguins are back, for better or

1404235,A3BW9ENHAN5ILP,B004EPZ0AC,ReubenR,"[10, 12]","Before I write my review, I should point out the the reason this movie has such a disproportionate number of 1-star reviews is because blogger Mike Mozart orchestrated a protest in support of killing the overreaching SOPA (Stop Online Piracy Act) and PIPA (Protect IP Act) bills that were introduced by Representative Lamar S. Smith (R-TX) and Senator Patrick Leahy (D-VT), respectively in 2011. Not sure anyone seeing those reviews will connect the dots and realize that all those 1-star reviews have nothing to do with Happy Feet 2, and it's a shame this movie was targeted. Glad SOPA and PIPA were killed, but the collateral damage done to this movie was a real shame.Is it a 5-star movie? No, but it's a 4-star movie for sure. Just the comedy bits with Bill the Krill and Will the Krill are worth it - they have the absolute best lines in the movie. (Example: when Bill and Will leave the ""swarm,"" Bill cries, ""Goodbye, Krill world!"")If you liked the first Happy Feet movie, you'll like this one almost as much. (Or, if you felt there was too much of an environmental message in the first one, you might like this sequel better since the preaching is toned down significantly.)The music is fun and as professionally performed as the first Happy Feet, and the graphics are stunning. There are a few scenes where real people are inserted, just like in the first move, but they're a lot better integrated than the first film. (The sailor who plays the guitar riffs for ""We are the Champions"" is just amazing to watch.)The 2D Blu-ray is flawless with no discernible flaws in the picture, and the sound is just as good. This disc is about as close to reference as you'll get these days.However, the 3D Blu-ray has problems...at least on my television, a Sharp 70"" Elite (PRO-70X5FD) which is one of the absolute best 3D TV out today. The amount of crosstalk (ghosting) makes the 3D version unwatchable, IMHO. Perhaps other TVs render the 3D of this disc better, but considering that Avatar, Hubble 3D, Immortals, Hugo, and many other recent 3D Blu-rays look almost flawless on this TV makes me think this 3D disc has an authoring problem. Hopefully other reviewers will chime in to specifically discuss this disc's 3D on their respective TVs to confirm or disprove that this is a problem.One last note - for those of you who hate that Blu-rays from Amazon.com still come with hard-to-remove stickers on the outer slip cases, this disc is no different. However, because of the more resilient holographic cover on the slip case, the stickers come off a little easier than they would on a matte slip case.",4,250+ negative reviews were orchestrated by a blogger upset with SOPA,1332547200,"03 24, 2012",2012,2601,"['write', 'review', 'should', 'point', 'out', 'reason', 'movie', 'disproportionate', 'number', '1-star', 'reviews', 'blogger', 'Mike', 'Mozart', 'orchestrated', 'protest', 'support', 'killing', 'overreaching', 'SOPA', 'Stop', 'Online', 'Piracy', 'Act', 'PIPA', 'Protect', 'IP', 'Act', 'bills', 'were', 'introduced', 'Representative', 'Lamar', 'S.', 'Smith', 'R-TX', 'Senator', 'Patrick', 'Leahy', 'D-VT', 'respectively', '2011', 'Not', 'sure', 'anyone', 'seeing', 'reviews', 'will', 'connect', 'dots', 'realize', '1-star', 'reviews', 'have', 'nothing', 'do', 'Happy', 'Feet', '2', 'shame', 'movie', 'was', 'targeted', 'Glad', 'SOPA', 'PIPA', 'were', 'killed', 'collateral', 'damage', 'done', 'movie', 'was', 'real', 'shame.Is', '5-star', 'movie', 'No', '4-star', 'movie', 'sure', 'Just', 'comedy', 'bits', 'Bill', 'Krill', 'Will', 'Krill', 'are', 'have', 'absolute', 'best', 'lines', 'movie', 'Example', 'when', 'Bill', 'Will', 'leave', 'swarm', 'Bill', 'Goodbye', 'Krill', 'world', 'liked', 'first', 'Happy', 'Feet', 'movie', ""'ll"", 'like', 'one', 'almost', 'much', 'felt', 'was', 'too', 'much', 'environmental', 'message', 'first', 'one', 'might', 'like', 'sequel', 'better', 'preaching', 'toned', 'down', 'significantly', 'music', 'fun', 'professionally', 'performed', 'first', 'Happy', 'Feet', 'graphics', 'are', 'stunning', 'are', 'few', 'scenes', 'where', 'real', 'people', 'are', 'inserted', 'just', 'first', 'move', ""'re"", 'lot', 'better', 'integrated', 'first', 'film', 'sailor', 'who', 'guitar', 'riffs', 'are', 'Champions', 'just', 'amazing', 'watch', '2D', 'Blu-ray', 'flawless', 'discernible', 'flaws', 'picture', 'sound', 'just', 'as', 'good', 'disc', 'about', 'as', 'close', 'reference', ""'ll"", 'get', 'days.However', '3D', 'Blu-ray', 'problems', 'least', 'television', 'Sharp', '70', 'Elite', 'PRO-70X5FD', 'one', 'absolute', 'best', '3D', 'TV', 'today', 'amount', 'crosstalk', 'ghosting', '3D', 'version', 'unwatchable', 'IMHO', 'Perhaps', 'other', 'TVs', '3D', 'disc', 'better', 'considering', 'Avatar', 'Hubble', '3D', 'Immortals', 'Hugo', 'many', 'other', 'recent', '3D', 'Blu-rays', 'look', 'almost', 'flawless', 'TV', 'think', '3D', 'disc', 'authoring', 'problem', 'Hopefully', 'other', 'reviewers', 'will', 'chime', 'specifically', 'discuss', 'disc', '3D', 'respective', 'TVs', 'confirm', 'disprove', 'problem.One', 'last', 'note', 'who', 'hate', 'Blu-rays', 'Amazon.com', 'still', 'come', 'hard-to-remove', 'stickers', 'outer', 'slip', 'cases', 'disc', 'different', 'However', 'more', 'resilient', 'holographic', 'cover', 'slip', 'case', 'stickers', 'come', 'off', 'little', 'easier', 'would', 'matte', 'slip', 'case']",N/A

These penguins are adorable. I love the dancing and all of the musical selections. I enjoyed the back-and-forth dialogue between Mumble (played by Elijah Wood) and Eric (played by Ava Acres). I thought it was kinda cool to hear Common playing a penguin (Seymour). I didn't even realize that Brad Pitt and Matt Damon played the voices of Will the Krill and Bill the Krill until after the film was over. I wasn't as interested in their characters in the film, but I'm a big fan of the actors so that makes me want to see it again just to hear them. I had no idea Pink played the penguin Gloria either. Finding this stuff out after the fact makes me want to hear them and picture the people behind the film.Cons: The first film was definitely better. The plot for this one lasted way too long. I didn't really care about the krill trying to find something bigger in life than being at the bottom of the food chain. I was bored with the elephant seals and their attitudes. And as much as I liked watching Eric rebel against Mumble, I have yet to be entertained by Raul or Ramon. I was tired of those characters immediately. I could've gone the whole movie without any of these characters and seen more to do with Gloria, Mumble and Eric. I liked Eric's relationship with Atticus (played by Benjamin Flores Jr.) and felt like that could've been developed more.If not for the music, I could've gone without seeing this one at a movie theater.

They try to add a more grown up story and focus less on what made the first one so fun to watch. This is a good movie for kids but there is something missing to make it as good as the first one.

But seeing the ice melting in such a terrifying way, seeing grass growing everywhere around their friends Mumble and Gloria, seeing thousands of penguins about to die... was not something my kids needed to see.My oldest (6) was very stressed during the movie, telling me he didn't want to see the ice melting and asking continuously if the movie would end well.Not at all funny and with much less dancing and singing than the first one, this is actually a thriller kids don't need to watch.We didn't even enjoy the singing since Gloria's voice is nothing like it used to be and Eric's singing is so tremendously squeaky.Where are their parents, anyway?

1404252,AP1WE2DB14IL1,B004EPZ0AC,"Whitt Patrick Pond ""Whitt""","[5, 13]","Director:  George MillerWriters:  George Miller, Gary Eck, Warren Coleman, Paul LivingstonHappy Feet Two, a sequel to the 2006 film Happy Feet, is something of a mixed bag.  On the one hand it is, like the original, a masterful feat of CGI animation in the way it portrays in stunning detail both the animal characters and the stark beauty of the Antarctic and aquatic environments they live in.  But on the other hand, unlike the original, the story is a near-incoherent mess of multiple meandering plot threads and, quite frankly, too many characters.  Given that it was directed by George Miller and written by Miller, Gary Eck, Warren Coleman and Paul Livingston, most of whom were involved in the directing and writing of the first film, it is something of a puzzle as to why the story-telling side of things fell so far short this time around.The plot:  Mumble (Elijah Wood) and Gloria (voiced this time around by Pink) now have a young son named Erik (Ava Acres) who's reluctant to dance and who, when encouraged to try by Mumble, ends up falling flat on his face in front of the whole Emperor penguin community and is humiliated. Erik then runs away - along with his two best friends Boadicia (Meibh Campbell) and Atticus (Lil P-Nut) - with Ramon (Robin Williams) who has decided to return to his original home of Adele-land.  When they reach Adele-land, they find that much has changed.  The Adele penguin community is now under the god-like leadership of a strange-looking penguin (actually a puffin pretending to be a penguin) named The Mighty Sven (Hank Azaria) who can fly!  Lovelace (Robin Williams again) who met Sven when both were rescued by a Russian trawler, acts as his prophet, proclaiming to all and sundry the miraculous history and powers of The Mighty Sven and the philosophy of Sven-Think (""If you want it, you must will it. If you will it, it will be yours."")From here on, the plot threads and characters involved only multiply and grow more inter-tangled. Mumble goes to Adele-land to bring back Erik and his friends, only to find Erik doesn't want to leave his hero, The Mighty Sven.  Ramon pursues a female penguin named Carmen (Sofia Vergara) who wants nothing to do with him, but Sven convinces Ramon to believe in himself and his destiny. The scene then abruptly switches to underwater where we meet two kirll - Will the Krill (Brad Pitt) and Bill the Krill (Matt Damon), who are part of a huge swarm of millions of krill but who decide to leave because Will believes there is cosmic  meaning to be found beyond the swarm.  Back on the surface, a sudden splitting of glacial ice disrupts Emperor-land and traps the Emperor penguin community in a high-walled canyon of ice, cutting them off from the ocean and hence from their food supply.  Erik and his friends begin their return with Mumble to Emperor-land, but only because Sven urged him to.  Along the way, they encounter an aggressive bull elephant seal, Bryan the Beach Master (Richard Carter), and his two pups, who refuses to back up to let them pass across a narrow ice bridge, but events lead to Mumble rescuing Bryan and Bryan swearing that he owes Mumble a favor.  When they finally reach Emperor-land, they find that they cannot reach the now-trapped Emperor penguin community.  As Mumble and Erik try to find a way to save the trapped penguins from starvation, the scenes go back and forth between Emperor penguins, Adele penguins, Mumble, Erik, Ramon, Lovelace, Sven, Will and Bill, Bryan and the seal herd, with some humans and a flock of menacing skua (basically sea vultures) added into the mix for good measure.  Sound jumbled and thrown together?  It is.As is the singing and dancing.  The original Happy Feet had singing and dancing, but there was a seamless continuity to it all and everything flowed.  Here, it feels like they threw in everything but the kitchen sink (and they even do that at one point when Erik launches into an operatic aria about his father) with the result that there's no flow and no unifying theme. Instead, the film feels like it's constantly veering off into new directions, none of which is ever followed up on.  If there is a unifying theme - other than the obvious environmental one and the usual heavy-handed messages of 'Be Yourself!"" and ""Everyone needs to work together!"" - it's insecurity.  Erik's insecurity about fitting into the community.  Mumble's insecurity about being a father.  Ramon's insecurity about finding a mate.  Sven's insecurity about not being accepted if the others find out he's not a penguin.  Will's insecurity at finding out krill are at the bottom of the food chain, and Bill's insecurity about not being part of a swarm.  And Bryan's insecurity of what will happen to him if the other seals find out he backed up for a penguin.  Which pretty much sums up the core problem with Happy Feet Two - it's an insecure movie that isn't sure just what it wants to be.To be fair, I fear that I'm making the film sound worse than it actually is, which is not my intention.  Happy Feet Two is not a bad film at all.  In point of fact, the individual pieces of it are all quite good.  I particularly liked the scenes with Will and Bill, which in addition to being stunningly animated were also pretty funny and the most likely to appeal to adult viewers, especially ones who enjoy delightfully painful puns like the one in the exchange where Will cries ""I want to be free!"" and Bill replies ""There's no such thing as free, Will.""  But put them all together and what you end up with is a jumble, a case where the whole is actually less than the sum of the parts.  Much as I liked the Will and Bill scenes, you could in fact have cut all of them out and it wouldn't have affected the main story line at all.I would still recommend Happy Feet Two.  Children will probably not have too much of a problem with the meandering plot threads, though they may make the film too long for smaller children.  And as I said, the CGI animation is extremely well done.  I just wish that they had thought a bit more on the screenplay before making the movie.  This is definitely a case where less would have been more.",3,"A so-so sequel with stunning CGI animation hampered by jumbled, incoherent story",1322956800,"12 4, 2011",2011,6154,"['Director',
