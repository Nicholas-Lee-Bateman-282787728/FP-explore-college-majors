1585015,A2F2MOAA57WAUS,B0093URN8K,Roz,"[20, 24]","Excellent total body workout DVD for beginners, or advanced users.  I highly recommend buying this new DVD from SparkPeople.com and Coach Nicole.  This new DVD takes up where 28 Day BootCamp DVD left off. Very well planned for head to toe exercises, strength training and balancing.  Coach Nicole guides you through each session with ease.  You have to think about what you are doing which is a nice challenge with great results.

1585017,A288S8HLU9FX6X,B0093URN8K,"S. Livingston ""TheCrochetDeacon""","[45, 46]","I completed all 3 workouts on this dvd. Of the three workouts, Bodyweight Burn, Barre Body and Sizzle Sculpt, the Barre Body is my favorite.  As a child I took ballet and this workout brought back a few memories. Enjoyed this one very much. The pace and fluid movement was nice and controlled. Due to an injury, I kept it low to no impact, yet the workout was very effective. I also limited or did not use weights, although, it is just as effective without weights. Like the previous dvd from Sparkpeople, The 28-day Bootcamp, I  enjoyed that all the moves can be modified to fit ones physical limitations or needs.There are three workout levels, Beginner, Intermediate and Advanced.  The more your progress, the more time you spend working out.  But even for the time-crunched individual, you can amp up the basic level by following the advanced moves in that workout and still receive an effective workout.This is a great addition to my Leslie walks.",5,Short and effective Total Body Sculpting,1354924800,"12 8, 2012",2012,952,"['completed', '3', 'workouts', 'dvd', 'three', 'workouts', 'Bodyweight', 'Burn', 'Barre', 'Body', 'Sizzle', 'Sculpt', 'Barre', 'Body', 'favorite', 'child', 'took', 'ballet', 'workout', 'brought', 'back', 'few', 'memories', 'Enjoyed', 'one', 'very', 'much', 'pace', 'fluid', 'movement', 'was', 'nice', 'controlled', 'Due', 'injury', 'kept', 'low', 'impact', 'workout', 'was', 'very', 'effective', 'also', 'limited', 'did', 'not', 'use', 'weights', 'just', 'as', 'effective', 'weights', 'previous', 'dvd', 'Sparkpeople', '28-day', 'Bootcamp', 'enjoyed', 'moves', 'can', 'be', 'modified', 'fit', 'ones', 'physical', 'limitations', 'are', 'three', 'levels', 'Beginner', 'Intermediate', 'Advanced', 'more', 'progress', 'more', 'time', 'spend', 'working', 'out', 'even', 'time-crunched', 'individual', 'can', 'amp', 'up', 'basic', 'level', 'following', 'advanced', 'moves', 'workout', 'still', 'receive', 'effective', 'workout.This', 'great', 'addition', 'Leslie', 'walks']",SPARKPEOPLE: TOTAL BODY SCULPTING
