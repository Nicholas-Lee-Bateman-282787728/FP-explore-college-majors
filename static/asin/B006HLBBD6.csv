Bailey ""NYC Black Christian""","[6, 6]","I saw this movie in the theater thinking it would be just like his other movie Blessed and Cursed, but he took things in a different direction.  I think this one was a little better than the aforementioned, whereas the former seemed more like a very long music video that was intended to promote his next CD, this seemed more like a real movie with only one or two VERY LONG music scenes.  Although it did have a small amount of profanity and showed a lot of skin in one of the performance scenes, it didn't feel nearly as compromising as watching a typical Tyler Perry movie.  I gave this movie 4 stars instead of 5 because if you've seen ""A Christmas Carol"", you've seen this movie. Although the story line is kind of predictable, I'd still say watching this movie is a nice way for Deitrick Haddon and gospel music fans in general to spend the afternoon.",4,A nice way to spend the afternoon.,1336176000,"05 5, 2012",2012,857,"['saw', 'movie', 'theater', 'thinking', 'would', 'be', 'just', 'other', 'movie', 'Blessed', 'Cursed', 'took', 'things', 'different', 'direction', 'think', 'one', 'was', 'little', 'better', 'aforementioned', 'former', 'seemed', 'more', 'very', 'long', 'music', 'video', 'was', 'intended', 'promote', 'next', 'CD', 'seemed', 'more', 'real', 'movie', 'only', 'one', 'two', 'VERY', 'LONG', 'music', 'scenes', 'did', 'have', 'small', 'amount', 'profanity', 'showed', 'lot', 'skin', 'one', 'performance', 'scenes', 'did', ""n't"", 'feel', 'nearly', 'as', 'compromising', 'watching', 'typical', 'Tyler', 'Perry', 'movie', 'gave', 'movie', '4', 'stars', 'instead', '5', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'A', 'Christmas', 'Carol', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'movie', 'story', 'line', 'kind', 'predictable', ""'d"", 'still', 'say', 'watching', 'movie', 'nice', 'way', 'Deitrick', 'Haddon', 'gospel', 'music', 'fans', 'general', 'spend', 'afternoon']",A Beautiful Soul
1515688,A2K04ZW8FGS7UF,B006HLBBD6,"Healer ""Darla""","[2, 2]","This movies closest shot at humility was when his child hood friend kept him (Dre) encouraged, and never took it to heart when he was being put down fellow was the encouragement of the movie for those who were looking a little deeper. The songs were not as good as the ones from &#34;Blessed & Cursed&#34; with the exception of &#34;You Can Call Me King.&#34; I felt like I was on a wanna-b pimp ride most of the time (and maybe that was part of what the producer was trying to show the audience). I couldn't  understand the red Aastro-boy phi sod Detrick Haddon used for this movie (it wasn't hype, it was hyper active).  The things that he said to people when they were really in need was like a family flashback....I must admit that there was just as much skin stimulation in the praise dancing as there was in the carnal videos. Which spirit can you cause to rise when you swing your hair around wildly, while your entire torso minus breast are open and you are wearing super short-shorts, with a banging young body. I am not hating because I am a woman approaching my winter in life nor, am I interested in the alternative lifestyle. However, the beauty of youth is phenomenal and vivid once it is lost physically as you get older. But it should not be on display to the point you can almost see the color of the panties or the g-string when someone lifts up their legs to praise the lord....

1515689,AV6QDP8Q0ONK4,B006HLBBD6,"The Movie Guy ""Movies from A to Z""","[11, 13]","**PLOT SPOILERS**Dre (Deitrick Haddon) is an entertainer who looks and sounds like a low budget ""Prince."" In this film he is also a player and goes to church on a lost bet to his childhood friend Chris Scott (Robert Ri'chard) who is part of his entourage. While at church he tries to pick up Ariel (Lanisha Cole) and ends up disgusted as this mega-church only reinforces the negative stereotypes.Once some of the characters are established, Dre gets robbed by his own security people and shot. During this time he has an out of body ""Christmas Carol"" type of experience which leads us to the expected ending.African-American spirituals are not on my favorite film list. If they are on yours, you might rate this one 4-5 stars. The acting was forced and didn't seem natural, perhaps because of the water downed dialouge. The music was good, what little there was, with Dre lip syncing. He could kiss a member of the audience and not miss a note. There is also the unbelievable aspect...who carries $50,000 in cash to pay an artist? My biggest criticism of the film is that it endorses the mega-church idea, same as the film ""Brother White."" If you like mega-churches (and I don't) then these films are for you.PARENTAL GUIDE: No f-bombs, sex, nudity, or n-words. Deitrick Haddon using pick up lines.
