The show, like many other reviewers have noted, flew too low under the radar and never got the audience it deserved.With that sid, here's an oveview of the seasons:Season 1: a little short b/c the show was supposed to be a mini-series. It sets up the basic mythology of the show, and gets the audience ready for the task of living with these 4400 abductees/returnees. 4/5 (becuase its short)Season 2: The show really takes off with this season. The storyline is et up nicely, with some significant plot development (ripple effects, government conspiracies, and future predictions, too wet your curiosity). The cast is amazing, and you really get to see each main character's lives fleshed out. 5/5Season 3: This season falls a little short from the awesome dynamics of S2. The main stroyline is drawn on, and the progression of the overall story is slowed. The big issue: promicin! But, still the season is worth a watch. 3/5Season 4: This season goes back to the characterization and plot development of S2, and really begins to discuss the effects of promicin and how it will affect the lives of 4400's and on-4400s. The cast is exceptional this season, and all the development we've seen from some characters for the last 3 seasons really reaches it peak. 5/5The show was unfortunately cancelled, and for those who watch the show i couldn't have come at a worse time, as the S4 cliffhanger will leave you wondering ""what next?""The show is definately worth your while if you ahve not seen the show previously, or wrote it off as another ""sci-fi show""p.s.--no comment on the extras, as they are the same from the individual dvd seasons, except for the ""ghost"" season disc, which is a nice present to loyal fans!",5,An Unforgetable Show,1232409600,"01 20, 2009",2009,2332,"['A/N', 'will', 'not', 'critique', 'Heroes', 'try', 'compare', 'show', 'one', 'said', '4400', 'one', 'rare', 'sci-fi', 'shows', 'not', 'only', 'grabs', 'cool', 'mythology', 'also', 'interested', 'investing', 'charaters', 'how', 'are', 'adapting', 'near', 'impossible', 'experience', '4400', 'people', 'being', 'abducted', 'eriod', '60', 'years', 'sudden', 'reappearing', 'beach', 'one', 'fateful', 'brief', 'overvew', 'shows', 'focuses', 'two', 'government', 'agents', 'Tom', 'Diana', 'how', 'must', 'handle', 'above', 'mentioned', 'event', 'freak', 'week', 'events', 'harboring', '4400', 'show', 'many', 'other', 'reviewers', 'have', 'noted', 'flew', 'too', 'low', 'radar', 'never', 'got', 'audience', 'sid', 'here', 'oveview', 'seasons', 'Season', '1', 'little', 'short', 'show', 'was', 'supposed', 'be', 'mini-series', 'up', 'basic', 'mythology', 'show', 'audience', 'ready', 'task', 'living', '4400', 'abductees/returnees', '4/5', 'becuase', 'short', 'Season', '2', 'show', 'really', 'off', 'season', 'storyline', 'et', 'up', 'nicely', 'significant', 'plot', 'development', 'ripple', 'effects', 'government', 'conspiracies', 'future', 'predictions', 'too', 'wet', 'curiosity', 'cast', 'amazing', 'really', 'get', 'see', 'main', 'character', 'lives', 'fleshed', 'out', '5/5Season', '3', 'season', 'little', 'short', 'awesome', 'dynamics', 'S2', 'main', 'stroyline', 'drawn', 'progression', 'overall', 'story', 'slowed', 'big', 'issue', 'promicin', 'still', 'season', 'watch', '3/5Season', '4', 'season', 'back', 'characterization', 'plot', 'development', 'S2', 'really', 'discuss', 'effects', 'promicin', 'how', 'will', 'affect', 'lives', '4400', 'on-4400s', 'cast', 'exceptional', 'season', 'development', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'characters', 'last', '3', 'seasons', 'really', 'peak', '5/5The', 'show', 'was', 'unfortunately', 'cancelled', 'who', 'watch', 'show', 'i', 'could', ""n't"", 'have', 'come', 'worse', 'time', 'S4', 'cliffhanger', 'will', 'leave', 'wondering', 'what', 'next', 'show', 'definately', 'worth', 'ahve', 'not', 'seen', 'show', 'previously', 'wrote', 'off', 'sci-fi', 'show', 'p.s.', 'comment', 'extras', 'are', 'same', 'individual', 'dvd', 'seasons', 'ghost', 'season', 'disc', 'nice', 'present', 'loyal', 'fans']",4400: The Complete Series

1177063,ACVBZF3GK3O45,B001CQONMC,C. Davis,"[0, 0]","Bottom line: If you like stories dealing with alien abduction, time travel, or multi season story arcs, then this series might be for you.I watched this in part when it was originally on the air (USA Network) and partly over Netflix. Therefore, I have no comment on the quality of the DVD's only on the story itself.The basic plot is that all of the folks who have been kidnapped by aliens over the last fifty years are all returned at once. They have not aged nor do they remember what happened to them while they were gone. As the story develops, it becomes clear that these folks were not abducted by aliens and were returned to create a very specific outcome.The show itself mostly takes a ""...freak of the week..."" approach where one of the 4400 has issues or creates problems because of a special ability that they have developed. The series is pretty enjoyable if you simply watch it at that level. Additionally, one can enjoy the multi-season story arc, and if you are so inclined, you can read deep into the nature of class, society, and genetics. There is even a bit about the nature of police states as well.I was surprised to see Summer Glau in this series. I didn't recognize her from when it was on the air.

That said, The 4400 is a show unlike ANY that you have ever seen. It is a series that is one of my favorite shows of all time. It appeals to both non-sci fi fans and science fiction fans alike.The premise of this television show, of course, centers around the human elements involving 4400 people who have disappeared over the last 60 years. Suddenly in ""a ball of light,"" these individuals return. They haven't aged; they remember nothing; and they each possess usually only one particularly unique and amazing ability.The 4400 explores how disconnected and unraveled the lives are of those who have been returned.  In many cases, their parents or loved ones have already died; in almost all cases - their significant others have moved on with their own lives.  They are met with suspicion and fear wherever they go.The acting is brilliant; the writing is superb; and the ""powers that be"" at USA should resign for canceling this show.  After watching this DVD, I never wanted it to end.  I think the ONLY thing that could redeem USA is if they start a new story line where 5 years of ""Promise City"" has endured and attempt to get as many of the actors back as possible.And yes.

The early episodes tend to focus on one person at a time, as they discover their individual ""gift"" and try to adapt, but then the story seems to get bogged down in trying to figure out who in the future was doing what and why, and what these 4400 people are supposed to be accomplishing, and who in the future would be the ""good"" guys vs. the ""bad"" guys... whether the ""gifts"" are to save mankind or sabotage us.

Instead of developing a good idea, it seemed to morf into an effort to be:  social commentary, Si-fi, drama, mystery &  crime.  It just didn't work after the first 2 seasons.  The acting and ideas were good; and the characters were compelling.  I would give the first season 5 stars, second 4.5, third 3.5 and the last 3.  Nevertheless, it was better than most of what's out there.It can be unsatisifying for the viewer to have the series end with a cliff-hanger (it was cancilled abruptly after season 4).  So one needs to be prepared.

Because I and my late husband had a UFO experience I can't even begin to describe 4400 because it has so much going on but it is not one of those shows where you get lost in all the people. My husband and I were going  to a Rabbi for a Jewish divorce; driving up a hill when we got to the top we saw 'something' hovering over us.  It was no helicopter, plane or any other form of transportation in America and beyond.  The 'thing' hoovered for quite awhile-noises iminated from it - sort  of whirring sounds and two rows of lights. My husband was a UFO nut-he read everything he could get his hands on and truly believed they were and maybe are 'here.' When he was in Patton's army at some point there were a couple UFO sightings somewhere in the area.  My husband tried to get out of the car-he was not afraid one bit (of anything -EVER) and he was ready to go out and yell up to them or to look around the huge 'thing.' I held him by his belt for all I was worth screaming like crazy for him not to open the door.  After several minutes the 'thing' whirled away up into the sky. So this movie hit home somewhat. We've never been taken away (except by Calgon) (that's for the oldsters) but on that day I know damn well my hubby would have been perfectly willing.  4400 brought back all these memories and the 'thing -ship' that is spotted in the first show of the series was very much like what we saw/ Great movie-great memories of something that happened about 40 years ago.",5,Who Would've Guessed,1356393600,"12 25, 2012",2012,1538,"['bought', 'whim', 'got', 'money', 'worth', 'more', 'late', 'husband', 'had', 'UFO', 'experience', 'ca', ""n't"", 'even', 'begin', 'describe', '4400', 'so', 'much', 'going', 'not', 'one', 'shows', 'where', 'get', 'lost', 'people', 'husband', 'were', 'going', 'Rabbi', 'Jewish', 'divorce', 'driving', 'up', 'hill', 'when', 'got', 'top', 'saw', ""'something"", 'hovering', 'was', 'helicopter', 'plane', 'other', 'form', 'transportation', 'America', ""'thing"", 'hoovered', 'quite', 'awhile-noises', 'iminated', 'sort', 'whirring', 'sounds', 'two', 'rows', 'lights', 'husband', 'was', 'UFO', 'nut-he', 'read', 'everything', 'could', 'get', 'hands', 'truly', 'believed', 'were', 'maybe', 'are', ""'here"", 'When', 'was', 'Patton', 'army', 'point', 'were', 'couple', 'UFO', 'sightings', 'somewhere', 'area', 'husband', 'tried', 'get', 'car-he', 'was', 'not', 'afraid', 'one', 'bit', 'anything', '-EVER', 'was', 'ready', 'go', 'out', 'yell', 'up', 'look', 'huge', ""'thing"", 'held', 'belt', 'was', 'worth', 'screaming', 'crazy', 'not', 'open', 'door', 'several', 'minutes', ""'thing"", 'whirled', 'away', 'up', 'sky', 'movie', 'hit', 'home', 'somewhat', ""'ve"", 'never', 'been', 'taken', 'away', 'Calgon', 'oldsters', 'day', 'know', 'damn', 'well', 'hubby', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'perfectly', 'willing', '4400', 'brought', 'back', 'memories', ""'thing"", '-ship', 'spotted', 'first', 'show', 'series', 'was', 'very', 'much', 'what', 'saw/', 'Great', 'movie-great', 'memories', 'something', 'happened', '40', 'years', 'ago']",4400: The Complete Series

I had heard a lot about the show, but never watched it.  One day I just decided to rent season one from our video store.  I was totally hooked.  I went back and rented season two and at the time I could not wait for season three to come on tv.  This was like right before Battlestar came on - so when the series ended I was comforted by BSG taking over that huge sci-fi gap that was missing since Enterprise ended. If 4400's was renewed for another season, I would totally watch it.  I also love the fact that the female detective cop lady was in Romper Stomper [Australian film with Russell Crowe].  It was good to see her make a come back.  My favorite female character in the show was Isabella, I wish we could find out what happens with her.  I also really liked Tom's son in the show, the one that was in a coma in the begining.  It would have been cool to see what they writers would have done with his character too.

The 4400 was picked up by a cable network and I have hardly ever had cable television. This show deals with the future of humanity. The 4400 puts the argument of who should be in the front of humanity before us. Should the most advanced people lead us or should they be tossed back into the mass of humanity. The show asks, can those who are advanced even associate with the ordinary? Maybe those who know better have to separate from those who are not interested in any kind of growth. I also enjoyed the side story in the 4400 about the African man and his daughter. Dark men and women are tearing themselves apart. We can come together by transcending our differences with the mind. The 4400 also offers this as an option.
