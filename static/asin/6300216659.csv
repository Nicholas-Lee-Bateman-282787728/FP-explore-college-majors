The movie's &quot;fictional&quot; team, the Bulls, are suppose to be the the Dallas Cowboys.  The coach is suppose to be Landry, the quarterback (Mac Davis) is suppose to be Don Meredith, etc.  Of course, any resemblance is &quot;purely coincidental&quot;.  Yeah, right.The point of the movie is how the players are manipulated/motivated to win.  Receiver Elliot, played by Nick Nolte, is a veteran nearing the twilight of his career.  He loves the game, but also sees the human toll. Mac Davis understands and doesn't care. He realizes that it's just a job.I asked a co-worker who used to play for Green Bay about that time, if the movie was accurate.  He said it was mild compared to the real thing.  This is what football was like when roughing the quarterback wasn't illegal, it was expected.  Everyone always knew football was business and not just a game, but someone forgot to tell the players.  When they realize it, it's too late. See this movie.

Aware of his position in a fundamentally corrupt system that demands everything of the players, then discards them when they are used up, he nevertheless puts up with it for the sake of the thrill he gets on the football field every Sunday and the joy of doing what comes naturally to him.If you're looking for an uplifting sports film with a rousing last minute win against overwhelming odds, look elsewhere.  This movie is an expose of pro football as big business in which the players are expendable commodities.  There is scarcely any game footage in the film until the very end, and even then it subverts sports movie conventions.  Unfortunately, the love story in the film is unconvincing, even though it is intended to serve as a dramatic foil to the dishonesty and manipulation Elliot faces in his professional life.

The fact that he is an individual in a team sport makes this story even more exciting.  Although he has come to the time in his career when medical science and tons of pain killers are a necessary daily diet in order to lace up the old cleets one more time for the team, he does not shirk his responsibilities or take the easy road when it comes to performing his job.  Mack Davis turns in a creditable acting job as Seth the veteran QB of the team that has his way even when he is wrong.  Now if you think that this movie is all about football you will miss the true meaning and emotion of the entire event.  In the midst of a savage and hostile working environment a person can still be true to self amidst the greedy management side of a very tough sport.  I hope that this whets your appetite to get this movie.  There are memorable moments in and out of the locker room.  The tell all book written by Peter Gent was more than an eye opener back a few decades ago and this rendition of the book does it justice in every way.  Once you start watching this movie you will not want to turn it off!  If you are a fan of football reality, you will want this movie.  Oh, by the way, the author Peter Gent played professional football for the Dallas Cowboys back in the 60's I believe.  That is what makes this movie so creditable and Peter does not hold back anything.  Enjoy!!

222221,A2UUWETDYA2EKV,6300216659,Douglas Doepke,"[4, 4]","Fine sleeper film, very much a reflection of iconoclast 1970's. Seldom has corruptive nature of professional sports been on more vivid display than here. Pro football (and others?) comes across as supremely exploitative of players, with millionaire owners collecting the reflected glory. Sure, money is good as is lure of easy women, and adulation is hard to resist, but cost comes high as battered and bruised Nick Nolte finally figures out. Emphasis throughout is on obvious physical toll, but inner toll proves equally devastating. Team quarterback Mac Davis's sly character and coaching staff's slimy ploys illustrate that inner rot in sometimes subtle fashion. Davis's understated performance provides memorable glimpse of intelligent man trapped by own weaknesses. Also one of Nick Nolte's most natural performances in both a brilliant and unorthodox career. His Phil Elliot may not be as clever as Davis, but the love of the game is truer, helping him finally see through the clouds of hype. But where oh where was director Kotcheff when beleagured non-actress Dale Haddon so clearly needed help. Her one and only expression, paralyzed fear, almost brings down the entire film. Was the casting of this ex-Playboy playmate Hugh Hefner's price for  assistance with the production? Thanks Peter Gent for the gutsy expose' and Frank Yablans for bringing it to the screen intact. (After all those Monday evenings on tv, who could ever think of Tom Landry, Don Meredith or straight-laced Roger Staubach the same way again.) (Then too, fans might check out 1949's ""Easy Living"", a less caustic but also revealing film on the earlier days of pro football.) All in all, the screenplay of North Dallas is one of the best from the period -- humorous, savvy, and richly ironic -- the final boardroom scene arguably among the most compelling of any on sports. It's also one of the best arguments for getting athletics out of  all those cathedrals of cult worship and back into neighborhood sandlots where they belong.",5,America's Team?,1120262400,"07 2, 2005",2005,2011,"['Fine', 'sleeper', 'film', 'very', 'much', 'reflection', 'iconoclast', '1970', 'Seldom', 'corruptive', 'nature', 'professional', 'sports', 'been', 'more', 'vivid', 'display', 'here', 'Pro', 'football', 'others', 'supremely', 'exploitative', 'players', 'millionaire', 'owners', 'collecting', 'reflected', 'glory', 'Sure', 'money', 'good', 'lure', 'easy', 'women', 'adulation', 'hard', 'resist', 'cost', 'high', 'battered', 'bruised', 'Nick', 'Nolte', 'finally', 'out', 'Emphasis', 'obvious', 'physical', 'toll', 'inner', 'toll', 'equally', 'devastating', 'Team', 'quarterback', 'Mac', 'Davis', 'sly', 'character', 'coaching', 'staff', 'slimy', 'illustrate', 'inner', 'rot', 'sometimes', 'subtle', 'fashion', 'Davis', 'understated', 'performance', 'memorable', 'glimpse', 'intelligent', 'man', 'trapped', 'own', 'weaknesses', 'Also', 'one', 'Nick', 'Nolte', 'most', 'natural', 'performances', 'brilliant', 'unorthodox', 'career', 'Phil', 'Elliot', 'may', 'not', 'be', 'as', 'clever', 'Davis', 'love', 'game', 'truer', 'helping', 'finally', 'see', 'clouds', 'hype', 'where', 'oh', 'where', 'was', 'director', 'Kotcheff', 'when', 'beleagured', 'non-actress', 'Dale', 'Haddon', 'so', 'clearly', 'needed', 'help', 'one', 'only', 'expression', 'paralyzed', 'fear', 'almost', 'down', 'entire', 'film', 'Was', 'casting', 'ex-Playboy', 'playmate', 'Hugh', 'Hefner', 'price', 'assistance', 'production', 'Thanks', 'Peter', 'Gent', 'gutsy', 'expose', 'Frank', 'Yablans', 'bringing', 'screen', 'intact', 'Monday', 'evenings', 'tv', 'who', 'could', 'ever', 'think', 'Tom', 'Landry', 'Don', 'Meredith', 'straight-laced', 'Roger', 'Staubach', 'same', 'way', 'again', 'Then', 'too', 'fans', 'might', 'check', '1949', 'Easy', 'Living', 'less', 'caustic', 'also', 'revealing', 'film', 'earlier', 'days', 'pro', 'football', 'screenplay', 'North', 'Dallas', 'one', 'best', 'period', 'humorous', 'savvy', 'richly', 'ironic', 'final', 'boardroom', 'scene', 'arguably', 'most', 'compelling', 'sports', 'also', 'one', 'best', 'arguments', 'getting', 'athletics', 'cathedrals', 'cult', 'worship', 'back', 'neighborhood', 'sandlots', 'where', 'belong']",N/A

Gent played basketball @ MSU and went on to play Tight End for Tom Landry's Cowboys in the 1960s.  The coach of the team in the movie is obviously a caricature of Landry in the way that he calls guys out in film sessions and mixes football with religion, computers, psychology and philosophy (not to mention some mind-games to boot!).The crux of the film details what it's like to be an aging player in football.  Once players get north of 30 they become much more dependent on shots and pain pills and have to watch their skills erode with each passing season.  The movie depicts the devastating toll that football takes on even the most athletic bodies.Nick Nolte plays a wide receiver who finds himself in just such a circumstance.  He is fighting for his pro football life while younger players are trying to push him out of the league to make a place for themselves.  He also is in the middle of politics being played out on multiple levels over who gets to play.While this is a sports movie, we hardly get to see any ""game"" action at all.  This is not a bad thing, just different.  The basis of the movie centers around the ""behind the scenes"" issues of a pro football team.If you like sports movies (especially football) you'll likely enjoy this one.

One of his master works about the darker side of the Australian outback WAKE IN FRIGHT, thought lost for ever, has recently been discovered in a rubbish tip.  His FIRST BLOOD gave a comic book slant to Agent Orange and the pyschosis of a Viet Vet and NORTH DALLAS FORTY reveals professional football as a pretty dispiriting business with the players tools to be used at the pleasure of the businessmen.  If it is the case that the American Empire began its slide as it sank into the Vietnam War, some of the reasons might be found in NORTH DALLAS FORTY which is pretty savage in its depiction of materialism - the tv sinking inthe swimming pool, the hunger guests have for the electronic toys (rubbish) stacked on a table; the black/white divide simmering beneath the relationships between players; the hypocrisy, the myth of competitiveness and its alleged blessings; Business which runs the game just as it runs the war(Haliburton). Nick Nolte is a confused player who loves the game but cannot understand the world.His battered body symbolizes a battered spirit.  The answer is love.  Mr Nolte, as Phil Elliot, grid iron star with magic catching hands, does not take the final  pass in the street from a fellow player.

222230,A1EBJ93E1T50RT,6300216659,Jason A. Miller,"[10, 10]","This is an unsparing, unsentimental look at pro football in which the players are alternately brutes, and slaves to management.  Coaches shamelessly manipulate the players and then discard them the moment injury strikes; the players are drugged up in order to coax them onto the field, while at the same time the unpopular players are ensnared by drug charges in order to trap them at contract renegotiation time.""North Dallas Forty"" is probably one of my favorite sports movies, and definitely my favorite football movie.  That's because of its defiant outsider approach -- ""Ball Four"", the baseball book that made Peter Gent's football novel possible, only ever wound up a lame sitcom; ""North Dallas Forty"" goes all the way.  Even though the movie is based on the Dallas Cowboys of the 1960s, the instantly dated 1970s' filmmaking technique remains timeless (even if it's from the same director who made ""Weekend at Bernie's"", which is timeless for very different reasons).Part of the movie's continuing appeal remains its cast.  Nick Nolte is a brilliant lead, as the rebellious but honest-to-a-fault North Dallas wide receiver Phil Elliott.  Phil tells it like it is and sees management for what they are, but doesn't realize he's being cheated out of his career until the third or fourth time he's been double-crossed by owners, coaches and friends alike.Playing a riff on Dandy Don Meredith, country singer/songwriter Mac Davis plays sly quarterback Seth Maxwell.  The rest of the football team is filled out with several ex-NFL players.  John Matuszak's second acting career was launched by this movie, and Bo Svenson's football career should have been launched by this movie.  The coaches, Charles Durning (as a cliche-spouting offensive coordinator) and the great G.D. Spradlin (playing a thinly veiled Tom Landry) both dominate their scenes.  And yes, that's Dabney Coleman as an oil man and part owner who delivers one of the movie's best lines (""Do you speak Canadian?"").Dayle Haddon looks great as Phil's love interest, but otherwise gets overshadowed by the rest of the cast.  She seems so disinterested in Phil throughout the movie that I was convinced their relationship wouldn't make it another week after the story ended.Kotcheff directs his football scenes with an interesting approach that could never be duplicated today: there's not a single wide shot of a packed house, not a single closeup of a spectator in North Dallas face paint and a Maxwell jersey.  Gone are the excesses of modern TV football coverage, and the only product endorsement I could spot was for xylocaine.  Most of the early football action is shown in mute flashbacks, and the climactic game against Chicago is not joined until after the two-minute warning.  Even with such minimal football, however, Kotcheff's action is so muddy, bloody and cruel that you can imagine the final game sequence was cued up in L.T.'s VCR the fateful Monday night he tangled with Joe Theismann's leg.Always worth watching every late January, ""North Dallas Forty"" is one of those films you hope is never going to be remade, because the original has everything you need in a football movie.",4,A better halftime show than Janet Jackson,1138579200,"01 30, 2006",2006,3162,"['unsparing', 'unsentimental', 'look', 'pro', 'football', 'players', 'are', 'alternately', 'brutes', 'management', 'Coaches', 'shamelessly', 'manipulate', 'players', 'then', 'discard', 'moment', 'injury', 'strikes', 'players', 'are', 'drugged', 'up', 'order', 'coax', 'field', 'same', 'time', 'unpopular', 'players', 'are', 'ensnared', 'drug', 'charges', 'order', 'trap', 'contract', 'renegotiation', 'time', 'North', 'Dallas', 'Forty', 'probably', 'one', 'favorite', 'sports', 'movies', 'definitely', 'favorite', 'football', 'movie', 'defiant', 'outsider', 'approach', 'Four', 'baseball', 'book', 'made', 'Peter', 'Gent', 'football', 'novel', 'possible', 'only', 'ever', 'wound', 'up', 'lame', 'sitcom', 'North', 'Dallas', 'Forty', 'way', 'Even', 'movie', 'based', 'Dallas', 'Cowboys', '1960s', 'instantly', 'dated', '1970s', 'filmmaking', 'technique', 'timeless', 'even', 'same', 'director', 'who', 'made', 'Weekend', 'Bernie', 'timeless', 'very', 'different', 'reasons', '.Part', 'movie', 'continuing', 'appeal', 'cast', 'Nick', 'Nolte', 'brilliant', 'lead', 'rebellious', 'honest-to-a-fault', 'North', 'Dallas', 'wide', 'receiver', 'Phil', 'Elliott', 'Phil', 'sees', 'management', 'what', 'are', ""n't"", 'realize', 'being', 'cheated', 'career', 'third', 'fourth', 'time', 'been', 'double-crossed', 'owners', 'coaches', 'friends', 'alike.Playing', 'riff', 'Dandy', 'Don', 'Meredith', 'country', 'singer/songwriter', 'Mac', 'Davis', 'sly', 'quarterback', 'Seth', 'Maxwell', 'rest', 'football', 'team', 'filled', 'out', 'several', 'ex-NFL', 'players', 'John', 'Matuszak', 'second', 'acting', 'career', 'was', 'launched', 'movie', 'Bo', 'Svenson', 'football', 'career', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'launched', 'movie', 'coaches', 'Charles', 'Durning', 'cliche-spouting', 'offensive', 'coordinator', 'great', 'G.D.', 'Spradlin', 'playing', 'thinly', 'veiled', 'Tom', 'Landry', 'dominate', 'scenes', 'yes', 'Dabney', 'Coleman', 'oil', 'man', 'part', 'owner', 'who', 'one', 'movie', 'best', 'lines', 'Do', 'speak', 'Canadian', '.Dayle', 'Haddon', 'great', 'Phil', 'love', 'interest', 'otherwise', 'overshadowed', 'rest', 'cast', 'so', 'disinterested', 'Phil', 'movie', 'was', 'convinced', 'relationship', 'would', ""n't"", 'make', 'week', 'story', 'ended.Kotcheff', 'football', 'scenes', 'interesting', 'approach', 'could', 'never', 'be', 'duplicated', 'today', 'not', 'single', 'wide', 'shot', 'packed', 'house', 'not', 'single', 'closeup', 'spectator', 'North', 'Dallas', 'face', 'paint', 'Maxwell', 'jersey', 'Gone', 'are', 'excesses', 'modern', 'TV', 'football', 'coverage', 'only', 'product', 'endorsement', 'could', 'spot', 'was', 'xylocaine', 'Most', 'early', 'football', 'action', 'shown', 'mute', 'flashbacks', 'climactic', 'game', 'Chicago', 'not', 'joined', 'two-minute', 'warning', 'Even', 'such', 'minimal', 'football', 'however', 'Kotcheff', 'action', 'so', 'muddy', 'bloody', 'cruel', 'can', 'imagine', 'final', 'game', 'sequence', 'was', 'cued', 'up', 'L.T', 'VCR', 'fateful', 'Monday', 'night', 'tangled', 'Joe', 'Theismann', 'leg.Always', 'watching', 'late', 'January', 'North', 'Dallas', 'Forty', 'one', 'films', 'hope', 'never', 'going', 'be', 'remade', 'original', 'everything', 'need', 'football', 'movie']",N/A

That's fine because they are beside the point. They are just an incidental part of the story. The real story is of the aging athletes.Nick Nolte plays the receiver of the Dallas football team. He was great in his day and still has the talent but a life on the field has severely battered his body. He's having a hard time keeping up and, for the first time in his career, he is not a starter. That slot goes to some younger talent. He's at the age where his body and his love interest insist that he should retire. The problem is that he genuinely loves the game.He has other problems as well. Most of the team are spoiled rotten and act little better than spoiled children. The team owner and the team coach are difficult to work for; they demand sacrifice of their players but are two faced and willing to permanently see them hurt in order to further other goals such as bringing along a newer player. Having your girlfriend catch the eye of the owner's brother is also something that tends to put a damper on either your professional career or your love life.This was presented as a comedy and there are some light moments where the players are acting badly. They are, after all, getting paid millions to play a game. It is really about the human decisions, though. It is about making tough, personal choices and being willing to live with the consequences.

Other movies have been funnier (&quot;The Longest Yard&quot;), others have used more Hollywood fantasy to make their point (&quot;Any Given Sunday&quot;), but none other than George Plimpton's &quot;Paper Lion&quot; have any accuracy.Not only is &quot;North Dallas Forty&quot; accurate, it is accurate in the extreme.

In a very Hollywood way, this movie uses big stars but makes a valid point about pro football in a way no film ever has.I went to Pete Gent's school, Michigan State University, where I lived in an athletic or &quot;jock&quot; dorm. I knew football players at MSU including a couple that went on to become pros and all-pro in the NFL.

A big reason for that is the startling performance of singwriter-singer Mac Davis. He got his character *down* - not too deep of a dude, but deep enough to step to Nolte at the end and say that he knew that his buddy was under surveillance and that suspension was next. He proved to be a buddy on the field but not ""off the field"".The athletes must work with those who they dislike and distrust. As in any occupation involving more than one individual.Nolte is no road scholar but is a little older, wiser, roadweary enought to be tired of the detached powers-that-be and their strategy meetings with tired motivational techniques and condescention. Not exactly tired of illegal substances to keep on keel, however. He meets a somewhat enigmatic, free spirit at a typical brawling, baudy pre-big game bash - I'm not clear on how she knew about it or why she would want to attend. She is the absolute perfect balance to all the rough dudes he has to live and perform with and her peaceful demeanor starts to work on him. In the end, shell-shocked over his own decision to chuck-it, he turns to her for...regrouping. Davis will continue playing football - and have no Love in his Life. Nolte will do the converse.The writing, directing, and cutting here is of a very high order, the attention to detail amazing. I am no fan of this sport but I had no desire to break it up in quarters - the picture flows.Other performances of note are by Charles Durning, the old-timer trying to keep the young guys focysed and the front office smiling.

Spradlin are absolutely fantastic in this outstanding film about the business of professional NFL football.  This is not a football film--it is a film about the big business of football.  Phil Elliot (Nolte) is an aging wide receiver with the mythical North Dallas Bulls (obviously modeled on the Dallas Cowboys.)  He is essentially rebelling against the cold-hearted businesslike approach of the team coach (G.D. Spradlin in one of his many great roles!).  ""None of you is as good as this computer!"" screams the coach ungratefully when Elliot deviates from the computerized play and scores the game winning touchdown.  The team owner admonishes Nolte with one of the greatest lines in any film: ""...seeing through the game is not the same thing as winning the game.""This is a truly great movie.  The combination of humor (""lying can be really good for a relationship...!) and the cold-blooded ruthlessness of the team owners and coaches gives this film a gritty authenticity that is difficult to describe.  Nolte, Spradlin, and Davis are particularly excellent, but the supporting cast is equally good and propel this film into the ranks of the all-time greats.I have read the book upon which this film is based, and it is good enough, but the screenplay here did things for the story that give it far more dimension than in the novel; a reversal of the usual state of affairs.

222245,A3LXKO2S6G2DBI,6300216659,"Stephen Kaczmarek ""Educator, Writer, Consultant""","[1, 2]","If you were around in the 1970s, you remember more than just the bad fashions and the disco music.  You also remember that American men - a lot of American men - still held on to the last vestiges of what it meant to be traditionally masculine.  That is to say you acted like a swaggering, boorish ass with more muscles than brains.  Of course, this persona might be tempered, ironically, with long, feminized hair, special attention to how your butt looked in jeans, and an addiction to drugs and alcohol.  Such were the times.  If you were a boy during this time, and you were lucky enough to have a father who acted like a man rather than an overgrown child, you observed the phenomenon with a mixture of pity and apprehension.  If not, you turned out a lot like the guys in ""North Dallas Forty.""  They're not bad guys, at least not in the sense of digging up corpses or something, but they demonstrate the flaws of an extended adolescence built on a foundation of intimidating people one way or the other with testosterone.  Nick Nolte, never more born to play a role, is one of these guys, sort of, a thinking-man's football player discovering that despite his best efforts he is getting old.  And age just isn't agreeing with him.  His body is addled with aches and pains; his mind is clouded with narcotics so that if anything in his frat-boy-envious world ever made sense, it no longer does to him anymore.  Even sex brings more pain than pleasure.  His struggle is not particularly original.  He is the lion long in the tooth, surrounded by other lions that haven't figured it out yet, if they ever will.  Certainly, the superior ""The Longest Yard"" covered similar ground but more effectively because it gave the players a cause to play the game.  In ""North Dallas Forty,"" playing the game is the cause.  Yet this story makes sense in a time of casual sex, drugs, and rock and roll and in a country where professional athletes are treated like they're gods.  There is something psychotically desperate in their flight from anything resembling civilization, from the parties where Playboy playmates are dragged off to be violated, often with grinning protests, to the bone-crushing efforts on the playing field in pointless competition.  By the mid-80s and early 90s, these guys had turned into steroid-juicing Schwarzenegger types, their hair trimmed neatly and their muscles oiled to homoerotic perfection (shhh, don't tell them), but here they are still rough around the edges, flawed like real people are.  ""North Dallas Forty"" succeeds in exactly what it wants to be - an indictment of the very image of man that it glorifies, but in this it is never satirical enough to be biting and never insightful enough to be dramatic.  It is fun though, the way watching a guy get hit in the crotch on ""America's Funniest Home Videos"" is fun.  Look for Mac Davis as a good old boy looking out for his friends' best interests so long as they approximate his own, but watch out for Dayle Haddon, who would be a deck chair if she were any more wooden.  G.D. Spradlin plays a prick as only he can.  Ted Kotcheff, never an imaginative director, gives a sallow realism in his straightforward approach, one of the highlights of a film that is at times a Mad Magazine version of professional sports.  The best scene in the film occurs in the locker room as the players nervously await the upcoming game.  You can almost smell the desperation and Ben Gay, and the bit where the minister blesses the whole event is a hoot.  And now that 80s are back fashion wise, we might even see this neanderthal return to celebrated glory.",4,"Still Like ""The Longest Yard"" Better But It is Worth a View",1334361600,"04 14, 2012",2012,3619,"['were', 'around', '1970s', 'remember', 'more', 'just', 'bad', 'fashions', 'disco', 'music', 'also', 'remember', 'American', 'men', 'lot', 'American', 'men', 'still', 'held', 'last', 'vestiges', 'what', 'meant', 'be', 'traditionally', 'masculine', 'say', 'acted', 'swaggering', 'boorish', 'ass', 'more', 'muscles', 'brains', 'course', 'persona', 'might', 'be', 'tempered', 'ironically', 'long', 'feminized', 'hair', 'special', 'attention', 'how', 'butt', 'looked', 'jeans', 'addiction', 'drugs', 'alcohol', 'Such', 'were', 'times', 'were', 'boy', 'time', 'were', 'lucky', 'enough', 'have', 'father', 'who', 'acted', 'man', 'rather', 'overgrown', 'child', 'observed', 'phenomenon', 'mixture', 'pity', 'apprehension', 'not', 'turned', 'out', 'lot', 'guys', 'North', 'Dallas', 'Forty', ""'re"", 'not', 'bad', 'guys', 'least', 'not', 'sense', 'digging', 'up', 'corpses', 'something', 'demonstrate', 'flaws', 'extended', 'adolescence', 'built', 'foundation', 'intimidating', 'people', 'one', 'way', 'other', 'testosterone', 'Nick', 'Nolte', 'never', 'more', 'born', 'play', 'role', 'one', 'guys', 'sort', 'thinking-man', 'football', 'player', 'discovering', 'best', 'efforts', 'getting', 'old', 'age', 'just', ""n't"", 'agreeing', 'body', 'addled', 'aches', 'pains', 'mind', 'clouded', 'narcotics', 'so', 'anything', 'frat-boy-envious', 'world', 'ever', 'made', 'sense', 'no', 'longer', 'anymore', 'Even', 'sex', 'brings', 'more', 'pain', 'pleasure', 'struggle', 'not', 'particularly', 'original', 'lion', 'long', 'tooth', 'surrounded', 'other', 'lions', 'have', ""n't"", 'figured', 'out', 'yet', 'ever', 'will', 'Certainly', 'superior', 'Longest', 'Yard', 'covered', 'similar', 'ground', 'more', 'effectively', 'gave', 'players', 'cause', 'play', 'game', 'North', 'Dallas', 'Forty', 'playing', 'game', 'cause', 'story', 'sense', 'time', 'casual', 'sex', 'drugs', 'rock', 'roll', 'country', 'where', 'professional', 'athletes', 'are', 'treated', ""'re"", 'gods', 'something', 'psychotically', 'desperate', 'flight', 'anything', 'resembling', 'civilization', 'parties', 'where', 'Playboy', 'playmates', 'are', 'dragged', 'be', 'violated', 'often', 'grinning', 'protests', 'bone-crushing', 'efforts', 'playing', 'field', 'pointless', 'competition', 'mid-80s', 'early', '90s', 'guys', 'had', 'turned', 'steroid-juicing', 'Schwarzenegger', 'types', 'hair', 'trimmed', 'neatly', 'muscles', 'oiled', 'homoerotic', 'perfection', 'shhh', 'do', ""n't"", 'tell', 'here', 'are', 'still', 'rough', 'edges', 'flawed', 'real', 'people', 'are', 'North', 'Dallas', 'Forty', 'exactly', 'what', 'be', 'indictment', 'very', 'image', 'man', 'never', 'satirical', 'enough', 'be', 'biting', 'never', 'insightful', 'enough', 'be', 'dramatic', 'fun', 'way', 'watching', 'guy', 'get', 'hit', 'crotch', 'America', 'Funniest', 'Home', 'Videos', 'fun', 'Look', 'Mac', 'Davis', 'good', 'old', 'boy', 'looking', 'out', 'friends', 'best', 'interests', 'so', 'long', 'approximate', 'own', 'watch', 'out', 'Dayle', 'Haddon', 'who', 'would', 'be', 'deck', 'chair', 'were', 'more', 'wooden', 'G.D.', 'Spradlin', 'prick', 'only', 'can', 'Ted', 'Kotcheff', 'never', 'imaginative', 'director', 'sallow', 'realism', 'straightforward', 'approach', 'one', 'highlights', 'film', 'times', 'Mad', 'Magazine', 'version', 'professional', 'sports', 'best', 'scene', 'film', 'locker', 'room', 'players', 'nervously', 'await', 'upcoming', 'game', 'can', 'almost', 'smell', 'desperation', 'Ben', 'Gay', 'bit', 'where', 'minister', 'whole', 'event', 'hoot', 'now', '80s', 'are', 'back', 'fashion', 'wise', 'might', 'even', 'see', 'neanderthal', 'return', 'celebrated', 'glory']",N/A

Marshall,"[5, 5]","This film made in 1978 is a behind the scenes look at the world of professional football that remains sadly pertinent to the NFL today making the meshing of the business world and athletes a sport of its own.Nick Nolte plays an aging and aching receiver who has the heart to play the game of football but lacks the ability to have his mind controlled by the people who run the game. Nolte is excellent as he winches and moans throughout the film waiting for his chance to play but being continuously undermined by a corrupt coaching staff and the owners of his team. Mack Davis plays the handsome Texan quarterback who cares little about the mind control and more about having a good time. Charles Durning is the Maalox drinking assistant coach who adds some comedic relief to the story, along with Bo Svenson who plays a psychotic linebacker with nothing but ""kill"" in his heart. Dabney Coleman and Steve Forest are the evil business brothers who treat their players like machines tossing them out whenever necessary without a thought. Finally G.D. Spradlin does an excellent job as the head coach without much of a soul but with plenty of insight.The story shows a world filled with parties, adultery, corruption and drugs as it engulfs the football players searching to fulfill their dreams of stardom and self-importance. One hit can end it all and one badly placed step can change their world. In order to succeed and have a long career in the game drugs are used to keep the aging body going. While on the outside a toke of marijuana ends the game (shades of Ricky Williams here!). Somehow it just doesn't make any sense.
