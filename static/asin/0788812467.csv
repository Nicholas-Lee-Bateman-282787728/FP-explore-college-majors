Beverly""","[0, 1]","I hadn't watched this movie for many years, but I still remembered the basic story as I watched it again recently trying to get my 18 month old to be interested in the big yellow dog, the horses, cows and pigs.  She was only vaguely interested.  It is hard for this type of movie to compete with Toy Story and other modern movies that start and finish with lots of action and special effects.But the story here, a well done coming of age story, is timeless and classic and well worth sitting down with the kids and a bucket of popcorn to watch.  There are lots of things this kind of movie can bring for topics of discussion, and unless one has seen it a few times, the emotional parts should stir up at least some feelings (even for non dog lovers).I give a strong recommendation for this movie, it is a simple and straight forward story, and what it lacks in action and effects, it makes up for in it's timelessness and powerful story line.",4,Great family movie,1038182400,"11 25, 2002",2002,942,"['had', ""n't"", 'watched', 'movie', 'many', 'years', 'still', 'remembered', 'basic', 'story', 'watched', 'again', 'recently', 'trying', 'get', '18', 'month', 'old', 'be', 'interested', 'big', 'yellow', 'dog', 'horses', 'cows', 'pigs', 'was', 'only', 'vaguely', 'interested', 'hard', 'type', 'movie', 'compete', 'Toy', 'Story', 'other', 'modern', 'movies', 'start', 'finish', 'lots', 'action', 'special', 'effects.But', 'story', 'here', 'well', 'done', 'coming', 'age', 'story', 'timeless', 'classic', 'well', 'sitting', 'down', 'kids', 'bucket', 'popcorn', 'watch', 'are', 'lots', 'things', 'kind', 'movie', 'can', 'bring', 'topics', 'discussion', 'one', 'seen', 'few', 'times', 'emotional', 'parts', 'should', 'stir', 'up', 'least', 'feelings', 'even', 'non', 'dog', 'lovers', '.I', 'give', 'strong', 'recommendation', 'movie', 'simple', 'straight', 'forward', 'story', 'what', 'action', 'effects', 'up', 'timelessness', 'powerful', 'story', 'line']",Old Yeller VHS
80812,ANCOMAI0I7LVG,0788812467,Andrew Ellington,"[2, 2]","I don't know about you, but I grew up on `Old Yeller'.  This is, by far, my father's favorite movie.  The only time I saw him cry while growing up was when the family sat down to watch this movie, which was actually quite often.  I remember growing tired of it, wishing that we could watch something else, but denying the power of `Old Yeller' as a whole seems foolish now.  I remember when I read the book in school and then had to watch the film afterward.  Sitting there, with the whole class and obviously separated from the treatment it received in my own home, I was able to view it without a cloud of preconceived bias.  I was eleven.  In that moment I realized WHY my dad loved this movie so much.It speaks to you.Bypassing the obvious clich&eacute;s (yes, this movie is clich&eacute;d, but not in the way you may fully expect), there is something `real' about `Old Yeller' that I still respect to this day.  Despite having the perfect `presentation' with regard to its Disney values on home life and family, there is a rugged reality that swells within each frame.  The dialog is sharp and beautifully whole, the performances are all above average when you compare to Disney `live action' films of the time, and the general progression of story is also really well handled.  The impact from that crushing finale still hits you like a ton of bricks.  For those of us who are dog people, who love our pets and consider them family, there are few films that can really capture the weight of loss that comes with that territory quite like `Old Yeller'.So, sixteen years have passed since my eyes were opened in that classroom, and they remain open to the fact that family films rarely reach the beauty contained in `Old Yeller', a film I would be pleased to have my children `grow up on'.And yes, as a grown man this film still makes me cry.

The sets were done by the same man that did the sets for ""Shane"". Along with this wonderful story of a pioneer family and its incredible dog. You get a second disc filled with extra features. You get a Pluto cartoon on the first disc that shows before the feature. The movie will appeal the most to dog lovers but has something for the whole family. Old Yeller along with being a wonderful companion risks his life three times to save family members. The fight with the bear, wild pigs, and wolf are intense and not recommmended for young children to see. Furthermore when Old Yeller gets hydrophobia what has to be done will upset the little ones.

It made a lasting impression on everyone in our family. Not long afterward, we bought a Golden Retriever puppy and it was a fabulous dog.After a long, long absence, I saw it for the third time in the late 1990s on VHS - the one you see pictured here.  Since I never forgot the sad ending, I was prepared for that. My attitude was great going in, especially since I had become a fan of Dorothy McGuire since her magnificent performance in ""A Tree Grows In Brooklyn.""Anywa - to be honest - this time around I was disappointed. Yes, it was still a nice old-fashioned story but the impact was so-so and McGuire looked like she had aged 20 years since ""Brooklyn."" She didn't look like the same person from the famous 1945 drama.Tommy Kirk went on to be a star on television and in the movies for Walt Disney while I don't believe Kevin Corcoran, who was just as good as Kirk, did a whole lot after this....some westerns into the '60s. Good 'ole ""Davy Crockett,"" Fess Parker, also is in this movie but has a minor role, being seen only in the beginning and at the end. Chuck Connors also had a small role.A nice story, no doubt.

I had completely forgotten how powerful it was and was completely blown away by it's brilliance! One of Disney's finest! This film has stood the test of time incredibly well and, in fact, is probably only more powerful now than when it was first released. Superbly scripted, sensitively directed, and loaded with power packed performances! Simplistic and sincere, honest and real. Old Yeller plays like a breath of fresh air, making most movies of today look like cinematic smog.Perfectly cast, with fine, first rate performances. Tommy Kirk gives the standout performance of his career! Completely convincing, he brings an authenticity and genuineness to his character, in this most challenging of roles, as he runs the gamut of human emotions. Dorothy McGuire is perfect as Katie Coates, bringing a gentleness and warmth to the role of the mother. Not to be over-shadowed though, Kevin Corcoran gives an outstandingly astounding performance, especially for one so young, as the youngest member of the Coates family, Arliss. Jeff York, as always, is a delight, injecting some light-hearted humor into his role. And while Fess Parker may not have a great deal of on screen time, his performance is played with great sincerity, strength, and warmth. Rounding out the cast, with fine performances, are Beverly Washburn and Chuck Conners. Not forgetting scene-stealing Spike the dog, who is totally charming and completely disarming in the title role.More than just a story about a boy and his dog, this is a story about life and living. About the highs and the lows, of good times and bad, of loving and losing. For me, the most memorable moment of the film is the scene towards the end, between Fess Parker and Tommy Kirk, between father and son. To quote from the film, ""Well, now and then, for no good reason a man can figure out, life will just haul off, and knock him flat. Slam him again' the ground so hard it seems like all his insides is busted. But it's not all like that. A lot of it's mighty fine. And you can't afford to waste the good part frettin' about the bad. That makes it all bad."" To me, this sums up the heart of the movie, and is one of the most touching and moving moments in motion picture history.This is certainly one of Disney's best movies of all time. Endearingly enduring, it remains great wholesome family viewing.

80826,A8V74RZY8TIRJ,0788812467,"Forrest C. Hopson ""StarWatcher""","[3, 3]","""Old Yeller"" is one of my favorite Disney live-action films.  Tommy Kirk and Kevin Corcoran play brothers with parents, Fess Parker and Dorothy McGuire on the western frontier.  The father is going away on a cattle drive and tells his oldest son, Travis (Tommy Kirk) that he might bring him back a horse.  Travis and Arliss (Kevin Corcoran) are at odds throughout the picture, as Travis works hard on fencing and plowing, and Arliss mostly plays and cuts up.  The mother usually takes Arliss' side reminding Travis that Arliss is ""just a little boy.""  During this, a yellow stray dog takes up residence with the family and Arliss is thrilled.  Travis eventually comes to love the dog too, as he proves himself worthy by keeping raccoons out of the garden's corn and helping to save young Arliss from a vicious bear.  As the story progresses, Travis decides to take Old Yeller along to help him mark some wild hogs.  A local neighbor warns the family of the spread of rabies in some near-by communities and cautions Travis to be careful of the hogs.  During the hog marking, Travis is pulled into the herd of hogs and his leg is badly injured.  Old Yeller is also injured by the hogs fury and both dog and boy are taken home to recover.  Travis recovers well, and it seems Old Yeller has escaped any possible threat of rabies, as well.  Many reviewers have told of their dismay of Old Yeller's fate, and the following events that lead to Travis becoming responsible enough to do what has to be done.  I find the story true to life and what it must have been like to face unfavorable circumstances while trying to make it on the west's frontier.  All in all, ""Old Yeller"" is a wonderful film and very entertaining.  I highly recommend it , as well as the splendid sequel, ""Savage Sam.""  The dvd plays well, however, the picture is more grainy than I remember seeing it when aired on television.  The second disc is loaded with extras and are very enjoyable.  I've not seen the new two-movie release of ""Old Yeller"" and ""Savage Sam,"" however, I'd like to know if the quality of the picture of ""Old Yeller"" has in any way been restored?  Walt Disney left us with a vast library of wonderful films, and this is one of his best!**UPDATE!** ""Old Yeller"" and ""Savage Sam"" are now available on a single DVD disc in Disney's ""Old Yeller & Savage Sam: Two Movie Collection."" While it's great to have both movies on DVD, the ""Vault Disney Collection 2-Disc"" verison of ""Old Yeller"" is essential for Disney fans and especially fans of ""Old Yeller!""

Dibert ""the wessel DVD Collector and ...","[1, 4]","This movie hit the theaters on Christmas Day in 1957 starring Dorothy McGuire as Katie Coates, Fess Parker as Jim Coates and Jeff York as Bud Searcy. Based on the novel by Fred Gipson, Old Yeller is set in Texas in 1869. While his father is away on a cattle drive, 15-year-old Travis Coates takes over management of the family farm. Adopting a strictly business policy, Travis is irritated when younger brother, Arliss, adopts a frisky stray dog. Soon Travis is as fond of the dog as everyone else in the family is; moreover, ""Old Yeller"" is an excellent watchdog. However, while fighting off a mad wolf, Yeller is infected with rabies. Though Yeller seems unaffected at first, he eventually behaves so viciously that the disheartened Travis has no choice but to **** *** ***. A heart-to-heart talk between Travis and his returning father coupled with the adoption of a new pup, paves the way to an emotional but reasonably happy ending. Earning eight million dollars domestically on its first release, Old Yeller convinced Walt Disney to devote more and more time to live-action films and less time to animation, which at the time was a great business move. In 1963, Disney released a lesser sequel to Old Yeller titled Savage Sam. I was wasn't that crazy about this picture either. To me once the dog got in the fight the movie was over.

This movie embodied more than just the heart-warming love between a boy and his dog who've been through thick and thin together.  What this movie embodies is old American values, things we barely see anymore in today's society.  I loved seeing a woman worry about her husband who was about to go off on a three-month long cow drive.  I liked that men acknowledged young Travis's delegated authority to be in charge of the house while his father was away.  They did their part by grooming him and helping him to be a man.  You could also tell who was worthless.Yes, Old Yeller was more than just a movie about a young man and his dog. It was about a young man becoming a man by making one of the toughest decisions in his life at a very young age.  As Fess Parker's character at the end of the movie says to Travis, ""That's pretty rough son, but I'm proud of how my boy handled the situation.

There were wild critters, Native Americans (annoyed that someone was taking their land, again), insufficient rain, the lecherous fat guy looking to mooch your food, and hydrophoby (hydrophobia, also known as rabies).  Yep, life was tough in the old west.  But no problem, Katie Coates (classy actor Dorothy McGuire who appeared in numerous roles in movies such as ""Friendly Persuasion,"" ""Swiss Family Robinson,"" and ""Summer Magic"") manages to survive everything with the support of son Travis (Disney regular Tommy Kirk).  Katie needed help because her other son Arliss (Kevin Corcoran, another Disney regular) was an obnoxious brat.Father Jim Coates (Fess Parker, who was already a huge success in Disney's Davy Crockett shows) goes on a trip, leaving Katie, Travis and Arliss to fend for themselves.  Before long a big yellow dog shows up, much to Arliss's delight.  Initially Travis resents the dog because it causes him a lot of work when the dog causes destruction on the farm.  However, the big yellow dog is friendly and manages to save Arliss's life.  Old Yeller even wins Travis's love.Much of this movie is a comedy.  Arliss and Old Yeller keep us entertained with their antics.  Old Yeller is so big and lovable that you have to laugh sometimes.  Old Yeller is also very protective of his new family.As I said before, life is tough in the old west.  Wild animals existed all around the Coates homestead.  One day a wolf attacks the family.  The only thing that saves the family is the big yellow dog.  Katie quickly realizes that the wolf had rabies, and she pens Old Yeller up to learn whether the wolf has given Old Yeller rabies.I leave you to watch the end of the movie for yourself.""Old Yeller"" is one of those movies that deliberately tugs at your heartstrings.  Even I struggled to keep my eyes from watering when Travis faced Old Yeller in the shed.  However, Disney movies nearly always end with a message of hope and love, and so does this one.Sometimes it feels good to have your emotions manipulated, even if you are sad for a little while.

For anyone who has ever bonded with an animal (especially a dog), &quot;Old Yeller&quot; strikes a nerve or two. The was also the first time I ever heard the phrase &quot;It's only a movie!&quot; after I saw &quot;Old Yeller&quot; because I cried so hard. This is probably one of the finest family films ever made by the Walt Disney people. It's a simple tale of a frontier boy who bonds with a stray dog (that more than proves it's loyalty) and the boy's final realization that he has to grow up. Dorothy McGuire is the steadfast mother and Tommy Kirk is the boy who must make a gut-wrenching decision that will start him on the road to maturity.

80842,A6GMEO3VRY51S,0788812467,microjoe,"[21, 22]","The DVD treatment of this film is also the way a classic should be treated. Disney pulled out all the stops for the DVD's in their new ""Vault Disney Collection"" which has 4 different releases as of 1/29/03. I have always loved this movie, and you can read all the great things about the film itslef from other reviewers and from the vhs reviews. I want to talk about the DVD treatment. First and most importantly it's WIDESCREEN, maybe for the first time outside of a theatre. What a difference it makes, the film is beautiful in its scope as it was originally intended.EXTRAS!! Read all about it!There are about 3 hours worth of incredible extra material here. To find all of the extras is not easy, so make sure you poke around and push on every icon (especially arrows) you can and be sure to even pursue the items that do not sound interesting to you since they can in turn lead to yet another submenu of goodies.The 2 disc set has much more than is listed here or even on the packaging itself. One of the best bonus features is a complete vintage episode of the Walt Disney television show from 1957, the episode called, ""Best Doggone Dog in the West"". It has half the episode devoted to a  behind the scenes promotion of the film, featuring Dorothy McGuire as our narrator. The other half had a great old featurette called ""Arizona Sheepdog"", that ran in theatres in 1955 before a main feature. (TRIVIA not on this set - this episode was altered in 1961 for its rerun, and the Old Yeller segment was replaced with a 101 Dalmations segment.)Several featurettes and archive Galleries with studio fan cards, costume design sketches, lobby cards, invitations, film production letterhead, posters, magazine ads, screenplay, and the complete exhibitors campaign book; Audio features with production photos and behind the scenes shots with the sounds of Radio Spots from the original release, two songs, a foley sound effects demonstration, and 2 interactive ""Sound Studio"" demonstrations. Also more production archives; included is the fan letters sent to Gibson the author; a news story from TV about the unveiling of the memorial to Old Yeller in Gibsons home town, which Disney studio participated in; a documeentary on the writer; a short new video called ""Dogs"" ; recent interviews with cast members;My favorite, a nice featurette giving us a first ever rare glimpse of the famous ""Golden Oak Movie Ranch"" owned by Disney where this film and so many others were filmed. I had always wanted to see it and my wish finally came true. Another feature is the 1961 Disney Studio Album which is a photo album/video showcasing everything the Disney Studio created in 1957 from Parks, to TV, to film. A really neat extra is the actual complete recording of the original ""Old Yeller"" storybook LP album released as merchandising, narrated by Fess Parker. Next there is yet another documentary on the making of the film.Also included here as a big bonus is the original theatrical Pluto cartoon ""Bone Trouble"" released along with the Old Yeller in 1957, so you can see it the way you did back when. Show the kids the way it used to be, when you went to the movies and you saw more fun stuff than just commercials before the main feature.I challenge anyone to watch this without getting caught up in the story, or to keep from singing the great title song. All ages truly love this family film. The book that the story is based on by Gibson will long be remembered as a classic. Disney respected the book in their film, and made a movie that is many great things.Thank you!, whoever at Disney pushed to treat this DVD like this. The extras have caused me to rave about the Vault Disney series to everyone I know and buy extra copies for my loved ones as Christmas presents. I hope all Disney fans buy tons of these so Disney understands it is worth putting the extra work into a DVD. If I could give it 10 stars I would, well worth the price!",5,LOADED with extras!!!! 10 stars,1043798400,"01 29, 2003",2003,3935,"['DVD', 'treatment', 'film', 'also', 'way', 'classic', 'should', 'be', 'treated', 'Disney', 'pulled', 'out', 'stops', 'DVD', 'new', 'Vault', 'Disney', 'Collection', '4', 'different', 'releases', '1/29/03', 'have', 'always', 'loved', 'movie', 'can', 'read', 'great', 'things', 'film', 'itslef', 'other', 'reviewers', 'vhs', 'reviews', 'want', 'talk', 'DVD', 'treatment', 'First', 'most', 'importantly', 'WIDESCREEN', 'maybe', 'first', 'time', 'theatre', 'What', 'difference', 'film', 'beautiful', 'scope', 'was', 'originally', 'intended.EXTRAS', 'Read', 'are', '3', 'hours', 'incredible', 'extra', 'material', 'here', 'find', 'extras', 'not', 'easy', 'so', 'make', 'sure', 'poke', 'around', 'push', 'icon', 'especially', 'can', 'be', 'sure', 'even', 'pursue', 'items', 'do', 'not', 'sound', 'interesting', 'can', 'turn', 'lead', 'yet', 'submenu', 'goodies.The', '2', 'disc', 'set', 'much', 'more', 'listed', 'here', 'even', 'packaging', 'One', 'best', 'bonus', 'features', 'complete', 'vintage', 'episode', 'Walt', 'Disney', 'television', 'show', '1957', 'episode', 'called', 'Best', 'Doggone', 'Dog', 'West', 'episode', 'devoted', 'scenes', 'promotion', 'film', 'featuring', 'Dorothy', 'McGuire', 'narrator', 'other', 'half', 'had', 'great', 'old', 'featurette', 'called', 'Arizona', 'Sheepdog', 'ran', 'theatres', '1955', 'main', 'feature', 'TRIVIA', 'not', 'set', 'episode', 'was', 'altered', '1961', 'rerun', 'Old', 'Yeller', 'segment', 'was', 'replaced', '101', 'Dalmations', 'segment', 'Several', 'featurettes', 'archive', 'Galleries', 'studio', 'fan', 'cards', 'costume', 'design', 'sketches', 'lobby', 'cards', 'invitations', 'film', 'production', 'letterhead', 'posters', 'magazine', 'ads', 'screenplay', 'complete', 'exhibitors', 'campaign', 'book', 'Audio', 'production', 'photos', 'scenes', 'shots', 'sounds', 'Radio', 'Spots', 'original', 'release', 'two', 'songs', 'foley', 'sound', 'effects', 'demonstration', '2', 'interactive', 'Sound', 'Studio', 'demonstrations', 'Also', 'more', 'production', 'archives', 'included', 'fan', 'letters', 'sent', 'Gibson', 'author', 'news', 'story', 'TV', 'unveiling', 'memorial', 'Old', 'Yeller', 'Gibsons', 'home', 'town', 'Disney', 'studio', 'participated', 'documeentary', 'writer', 'short', 'new', 'video', 'called', 'Dogs', 'recent', 'interviews', 'cast', 'members', 'My', 'favorite', 'nice', 'featurette', 'giving', 'first', 'ever', 'rare', 'glimpse', 'famous', 'Golden', 'Oak', 'Movie', 'Ranch', 'owned', 'Disney', 'where', 'film', 'so', 'many', 'others', 'were', 'filmed', 'had', 'always', 'wanted', 'see', 'wish', 'finally', 'came', 'true', 'feature', '1961', 'Disney', 'Studio', 'Album', 'photo', 'album/video', 'showcasing', 'everything', 'Disney', 'Studio', 'created', '1957', 'Parks', 'TV', 'film', 'really', 'neat', 'extra', 'actual', 'complete', 'recording', 'original', 'Old', 'Yeller', 'storybook', 'LP', 'album', 'released', 'merchandising', 'narrated', 'Fess', 'Parker', 'Next', 'yet', 'documentary', 'making', 'film.Also', 'included', 'here', 'big', 'bonus', 'original', 'theatrical', 'Pluto', 'cartoon', 'Bone', 'Trouble', 'released', 'Old', 'Yeller', '1957', 'can', 'see', 'way', 'did', 'back', 'when', 'Show', 'kids', 'way', 'used', 'be', 'when', 'went', 'movies', 'saw', 'more', 'fun', 'stuff', 'just', 'commercials', 'main', 'feature.I', 'challenge', 'anyone', 'watch', 'getting', 'caught', 'up', 'story', 'keep', 'singing', 'great', 'title', 'song', 'truly', 'love', 'family', 'film', 'book', 'story', 'based', 'Gibson', 'will', 'long', 'be', 'remembered', 'classic', 'Disney', 'respected', 'book', 'film', 'made', 'movie', 'many', 'great', 'things.Thank', 'whoever', 'Disney', 'pushed', 'treat', 'DVD', 'extras', 'have', 'caused', 'rave', 'Vault', 'Disney', 'series', 'everyone', 'know', 'buy', 'extra', 'copies', 'loved', 'ones', 'Christmas', 'presents', 'hope', 'Disney', 'fans', 'buy', 'tons', 'Disney', 'worth', 'putting', 'extra', 'work', 'DVD', 'could', 'give', '10', 'stars', 'would', 'well', 'price']",Old Yeller VHS
80843,A2UQIIJ2CD8REE,0788812467,Monty Moonlight,"[1, 1]","Shortly after Jim Coates leaves his wife and two young sons alone on their Texas frontier homestead to go on a cattle drive, the family takes in a large, thieving, stray, yellow dog as pet and protector. The story follows the time of Jim's absence and Old Yeller's stay, as the endearing dog takes on the roles of play-pal to little Arliss and chore partner to teenage Travis, and fights off dangerous animals to protect them all, putting himself in great danger. However, with the closeness of animals to the lives of American frontier-folk, diseases like rabies prove to be just as looming a threat, as the Coates family comes to learn in one of the most heart-wrenching endings in both literary and cinematic history.""Old Yeller"" is a masterpiece of filmmaking and definitely among the finest work from the Walt Disney Studios to date. The tale is plain and simple, softer than the famous Fred Gipson book it was based on but extremely loyal at the same time, and easily one of the greatest coming-of-age tales of love and loss ever written or filmed. Painstaking detail was put into recreating life on the Texas frontier in this Disney classic, and though it was released in 1957, claims that the film is loaded with 50's sensibilities may be a bit unjust. This film is set shortly after the Civil War, not in modern day. Having things like the man being ""head of the household"" or ""breadwinner"" aren't always just 50's sensibilities. Anyway, if one takes a good look at Disney films of the time, one might be surprised to find that the Disney films often depict more believable families than what you'd see on television sitcoms and other films of the period. ""Old Yeller"" doesn't fall short in that area either. There are only seven human members to the cast, and all are outstanding (most Disney regulars) in strong, believable roles. Tommy Kirk (The Shaggy Dog, The Misadventures of Merlin Jones, The Hardy Boys, Swiss Family Robinson) is the human lead as Travis Coates, the young teenager who grows closest to ""Old Yeller"" and is hurt the most when the dog meets his emotional and legendary end. Kevin ""Moochie"" Corcoran (The Shaggy Dog, Swiss Family Robinson, Toby Tyler) is little brother Arliss, a feisty little boy who throws rocks and never sits still. Dorothy McGuire (Swiss Family Robinson, Summer Magic) is the ever motherly Katie Coates, and Disney legend Fess Parker (Davy Crockett, The Great Locomotive Chase) rounds out the family as fatherly and loving Jim Coates. The always hilarious Jeff York plays lazy, meal-mooching neighbor Bud Searcy, with Beverly Washburn as his sweet and put-upon daughter with a crush on young Travis. The final human castmember is the well-known Chuck Connors, who plays Old Yeller's original owner and a kind visitor to the Coates' farmstead. Throw in Spike the dog as the title character, no less impressive an actor than any of them, and you have one of Hollywood's greatest casts! Not to mention that this was directed by Robert Stevenson (Mary Poppins, Darby O'Gill and the Little People, The Love Bug), one of Hollywood's all-time greatest directors! No, there's really nothing much corny or extremely '""50's"" about this movie, if that's what you've been led to believe, aside from the ""Old Yeller"" theme song, though us Disney fanatics rather like it. It's wonderfully sung by Jerome Courtland (Disney's Andy Burnett).As for the DVD edition, the 2-disc Vault Disney release (now out of print) is a real triumph! Disc One includes two bonuses in addition to the beautiful widescreen presentation of the film: A delightful Pluto Cartoon, ""Bone Trouble,"" in which Pluto's attempt to swipe Butch's bone breakfast leads him to be chased into a hall of mirrors, and an excellent audio commentary (featuring Kevin Corcoran, Fess Parker, dog-trainer Bob Weatherwax, and more than anyone, Tommy Kirk; it seems that Kevin and Parker were recorded separately). In addition, the DVD menus look great. Disc Two's amazing Vault Disney menu is loaded with goodies. There's, ""Old Yeller: Remembering a Classic,"" a lengthy making-of documentary full of tear-jerking interviews with the surviving cast-members along with animal trainer Bob Weatherwax and T. Beck Gipson, the son of writer Fred Gipson. There's also a nearly 15 minute featurette titled, ""Conversations with Tommy Kirk."" This is an enjoyable, in-depth interview with Tommy about how he got into acting as a child, met Walt Disney, and various details about his career at the Disney studios, including an unfortunate misunderstanding with Fred MacMurray. There are a couple of montages too. One is a bit of a commercial really, and doesn't have much value. It's called ""Dogs!,"" and is nothing but a fast-paced montage of Disney dog clips. The other montage is more appreciated. It's called ""Disney Studio Album,"" and is a montage of Disney events of 1957. A sort of Disney video yearbook. ""Lost Treasures: Ranch of the Golden Oak"" is a guided tour of the California property where many films are still filmed, along with reminiscence from Old Yeller's cast members of course. A Production Archive on Disc Two is loaded with galleries in the categories of ""Production Stills,"" ""Publishing,"" ""Advertising,"" ""Screenplay Excerpt,"" ""Documents,"" and ""Biographies"" (of everyone but Jeff York for some reason). There's also a slideshow titled ""Production Gallery,"" though it just features some selections from the Production Stills gallery. The DVD also offers the original theatrical trailer, a 90's TV commercial for a TV airing, and another tear-jerker labeled, ""News Segment: Old Yeller Memorial."" This is a report on an Old Yeller statue dedication in writer Fred Gipson's hometown and focuses on his son. Laura Bush also gives a speech at this sentimental ceremony. What non-Texan folks might not know is that this isn't really a news segment, it's from an excellent Texas television program called ""Texas Country Reporter."" It's a long running show that is not unlike ""Made In America"" or other such shows on the more educational/informative cable channels like TLC, Travel Channel, or Food Network, just a little more down-homey. Also on Disc Two is a virtual jukebox featuring various audio explorations. There are two interactive Sound Studio experiences, a selection of Radio Spots, a Foley Demonstration, and a vintage ""Old Yeller"" record album story told by Fess Parker with dialogue from the film. Last, but certainly not least, one of my favorite types of extras to find on a Disney DVD, we get a complete episode of the Disneyland TV series! The episode, hosted by Walt, is ""The Best Doggone Dog in the World."" This treat shows us dogs of the world, introduces Dorothy McGuire talking about the film ""Old Yeller"" and narrating clips, and presents to us a ""True-Life Adventure"" type story about Arizona sheepdogs at work. A wonderful addition to a wonderful DVD release!Ya know, I gotta say, as much as I love the Disney Renaissance period of films like ""The Little Mermaid,"" ""Honey, I Shrunk the Kids,"" and so on, whenever I am walking around a Disney theme park and taking in the sights, sounds, and smells, it's films like this that really come to mind for me. The company still churns out some gems now and then, but Walt's legacy is the work the studio made under his guidance, and it really is at least as good as anything made after he was gone. Walking down nostalgic Main Street or anywhere else in the Magic Kingdom, I love having films like ""The Happiest Millionaire,"" Pollyanna,"" ""Swiss Family Robinson,"" and ""Old Yeller"" to look back on, and it's a shame that more young people aren't exposed to such films today. Thank goodness they're available on DVD for those who care enough to purchase them. Of course, as I mentioned, this Vault Disney 2-disc release is no longer in print and recently has become difficult to find. As with a few other excellent Disney releases, they have been recently rereleased in double feature editions, sometimes still in 2-disc sets, but usually missing some very nice extras. In Old Yeller's case, the film has been released on another 2-disc set, this time paired with its underrated sequel, ""Savage Sam."" While it's a fine way to acquire ""Savage Sam"" if you don't have it yet, I still recommend seeking out the Vault Disney edition if you don't yet have ""Old Yeller."" All the double feature lacks is the audio commentary, but for me that was reason enough to seek out the Vault Disney release. I will probably get the double-feature anyway to acquire ""Savage Sam"" though.",5,The Classic Tear-Jerker,1189555200,"09 12, 2007",2007,8530,"['Shortly', 'Jim', 'Coates', 'wife', 'two', 'young',

When the boys' father, Jim (Fess Parker) leaves on an expedition, mother Katie (Dorothy McGuire) becomes the head of the household. This is one of Disney's first attempts at capturing the great outdoors and vitality of the old frontier plains and it is one of their enduring live action masterpieces. Arliss is always getting into trouble - engaging wild bears and skunks and other critter in the brush, only to be saved in the nick of time by Yeller. However, when Yeller contracts rabies it is left up to Travis to do the humane thing and put his best friend out of misery. Upon its initial release the film did phenomenal box office. And there are still those who get a lump in their throats and a tear in their eye when this heartbreaking family drama and coming of age flick is mentioned in mixed company.Unfortunately for DVD-philes, this isn't Disney's best despite being advertised as part of their new 2-disc ""Vault Disney"" series. In fact, visually it's not even close to what a film like ""Old Yeller"" truly deserves. For starters, the print used to master this DVD is very softly focused while still managing to be riddled with edge enhancement, aliasing and shimmering of fine details. There's a lot of pixelization throughout that really breaks up fine detail. Color is poorly balanced, betraying the lushness of many of the outdoor scenes, with greens, in grass and trees shifting color from brownish beige to muddy beige and then back again. Flesh tones are never natural but appear too, too orange. Fine detail is generally lost in the darker scenes. The audio has been remixed to stereo but is very, very strident and forward sounding. At times it's painful on the ears and really doesn't hold in comparison to the fidelity of the period.Disney does gets top marks for their supplemental materials. We get documentaries, isolated scores, vintage advertising and short subjects, a gallery of stills, trailers and television spots and interviews with the surviving cast members. What more could anybody ask for?

Ross,"[5, 5]","Without an upgrade to the family favorite Old Yeller on broadcast, the next best thing is to cuddle up to the security of knowing there once was the kind of enduring comfort of a boy and a dog who looked out only for him, and what child has not imagined his own special angel in the form of a dog he could actually feel, touch, and share time with. The symbolism of the dog friend, loyal and fearless, who deserves the honor of so emotional and close a friendship, a love, is beyond compare, and has helped millions of young boys appreciate the special relationship of having a personal confidant whose loyalty was without question, and beyond compare. The human qualities invested in so strong a heart, free from judgement is one of the greatest tales told that has captured the imagination and inspiration of so many boys, and girls alike. For children who need confidence to face the difficulties of life, this story is extraordinarily well suited to children who need heroes. The fact that the hero is a dog simply makes the story endearing and realistic. A wonderfully tender and important teaching tool for children to appreciate the value and extent of loyalty as it can be tested, and pass all tests.",5,Lost in Space,1057363200,"07 5, 2003",2003,1208,"['upgrade', 'family', 'favorite', 'Old', 'Yeller', 'broadcast', 'next', 'best', 'thing', 'cuddle', 'up', 'security', 'knowing', 'once', 'was', 'kind', 'enduring', 'comfort', 'boy', 'dog', 'who', 'looked', 'out', 'only', 'what', 'child', 'not', 'imagined', 'own', 'special', 'angel', 'form', 'dog', 'could', 'actually', 'feel', 'touch', 'share', 'time', 'symbolism', 'dog', 'friend', 'loyal', 'fearless', 'who', 'honor', 'emotional', 'close', 'friendship', 'love', 'compare', 'helped', 'millions', 'young', 'boys', 'appreciate', 'special', 'relationship', 'having', 'personal', 'confidant', 'loyalty', 'was', 'question', 'compare', 'human', 'qualities', 'invested', 'so', 'strong', 'heart', 'free', 'judgement', 'one', 'greatest', 'tales', 'told', 'captured', 'imagination', 'inspiration', 'so', 'many', 'boys', 'girls', 'alike', 'children', 'who', 'need', 'confidence', 'face', 'difficulties', 'life', 'story', 'extraordinarily', 'well', 'suited', 'children', 'who', 'need', 'heroes', 'fact', 'hero', 'dog', 'simply', 'story', 'endearing', 'realistic', 'wonderfully', 'tender', 'important', 'teaching', 'tool', 'children', 'appreciate', 'value', 'extent', 'loyalty', 'can', 'be', 'tested', 'pass', 'tests']",Old Yeller VHS

And this DVD set comes with a second disc filled with an array of quick dog flicks coupled with interviews of people in the dog flick business.This 1957 movie is set in pre-Civil War America and centers around a frontier family whose ""Pa"" (played by Fess Parker) heads out on a cattle drive and leaves his eldest son, Travis, (is he only twelve?) in charge of ""Ma"" and his little brother Arliss.  The boy feels like the odd one out with his little brother getting all the attention, until a stray yellow dog turns up.  Travis and Old Yeller become best friends.Old Yeller wins the rest of the family over too by saving Arliss from a bear, saving the sweet corn from raccoons, and protecting Travis from wild hogs.  The hog fight leaves both boy and dog with flesh wounds from their frightful encounter and everyone worried whether either of the two would come down with rabies.  However, they both recover without incident.Then Old Yeller has a run-in with a wolf.  Soon after, Old Yeller is frothing at the mouth trying to get out of the shed that Travis put him in as a precaution.  Travis keeps telling his mother that Old Yeller will get better.  But Old Yeller becomes so sick and so out his mind, that Travis has to become a man and put his best friend out of his misery.This film made Sputnik look like a hot-air balloon!",5,"You Are So Beautiful, . . .
