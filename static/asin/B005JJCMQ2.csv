Its got great atmosphere, an interesting premise, and some interesting character designs and personalities for the main cast. The problem comes in that Chaos;Head starts off strong with an intriguing mystery and bizarre behavior from the main character, but it fails to deliver any sort of satisfaction with its conclusion. The science is poorly explained, the main villain comes almost out of nowhere, and it isn't ever made clear what some of the characters' connections to the main plot or sub-plots were. The main problem with Chaos;Head is a lack of focus. If they had trimmed down the number of characters and steered the story to follow the main protagonist more often, then this would have been far more enjoyable. I still think people should watch this show, but I can't really recommend a purchase.",3,Chaos;Head doesn't quite reach its goals,1322524800,"11 29, 2011",2011,871,"['do', ""n't"", 'want', 'rag', 'show', 'too', 'much', 'decent', 'got', 'great', 'atmosphere', 'interesting', 'premise', 'interesting', 'character', 'designs', 'personalities', 'main', 'cast', 'problem', 'Chaos', 'Head', 'strong', 'intriguing', 'mystery', 'bizarre', 'behavior', 'main', 'character', 'deliver', 'sort', 'satisfaction', 'conclusion', 'science', 'poorly', 'explained', 'main', 'villain', 'almost', 'nowhere', ""n't"", 'ever', 'made', 'clear', 'what', 'characters', 'connections', 'main', 'plot', 'sub-plots', 'were', 'main', 'problem', 'Chaos', 'Head', 'lack', 'focus', 'had', 'trimmed', 'down', 'number', 'characters', 'steered', 'story', 'follow', 'main', 'protagonist', 'more', 'often', 'then', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'far', 'more', 'enjoyable', 'still', 'think', 'people', 'should', 'watch', 'show', 'ca', ""n't"", 'really', 'recommend', 'purchase']",Chaos;Head: The Complete Series

At first glance the story seemed intriguing and after doing some more research on it I decided to buy it. Withing the first few episodes I quickly realized just how much of a mistake I had made. I've seen and enjoyed Steins;Gate which is another anime series from the same developer as this one however, Chaos;Head is nothing as enjoyable. The basic premise is interesting unfortunately it's execution is poor. The main villain has almost no introduction and is offered no explanation. Details are practically ignored regarding the science and it seemed like the producers tried too hard to pack all of this in. The story is rather simple and complicated at the same time, at the beginning of the series the viewer is offered no backdrop or details leaving them confused. As the series progresses the main premise becomes easier to understand but by the end were left completely dumbfounded by the lack of explanations and any sort of introduction. While the animation is top quality the story leaves much to be desired and suffers from pacing issues.

However, the story and plotting is poor. It copies elements from other animes, like bleach (the D-sword). It was a neat idea to make the main character a hardcore otaku, but it doesn't culminate into something more for him. In short this anime lacks meaning and narrative. It goes off on its own tangents, and sometimes it goes nowhere. There isn't much reason to watch this. Its mostly a generic crap anime. It would have made a better video game than an anime.

1463240,A3HZ8JLMMGVVPV,B005JJCMQ2,Jonathan A. Chang,"[3, 3]","I rarely write reviews; I'm just not good with describing things. But having just finished watching this anime and reading these reviews that are all over the place, I figure I could clear a few things up. Don't worry, no spoilers. First of all, this anime is not creepy. This is not aShiki: Part 1  (Limited Edition Blu-ray/DVD Combo)orSatoshi Kon's Paranoia Agent: Complete Collection(or Boogiepop Phantom), nor does it really aim to be a mind-bend likeSerial Experiments Lain - Boxed Set. There are some anime that will confuse you and maintain that general atmospheric vibe -- if you are into that sort of thing, then Chaos;Head probably isn't it. Let's be clear: I wouldn't even consider this to be in the same genre as the aforementioned anime. If anything, this should be compared to its successorSteins;Gate: Complete Series: Part One (Limited Edition Blu-ray/DVD Combo), or evenC: Control - The Money & Soul of Possibility [Blu-ray]. It's more of a sci-fi with psychological thriller elements, than a psychological thriller with sci-fi elements.What Chaos;Head is: an anime that's based on a visual novel. If you're unfamiliar with the concept of visual novels, they are like novels, except they usually have text over graphics and some music composition in the form of software. They have limited interaction, sort of like an extremely linear text-based role-playing game. Sometimes there will be choices you make at key points of a story. One popular concept in visual novels is that, as the main character, you play through the same world multiple times, and with each play-through, as you gather more information about the world, your character makes better decisions, leading up to the ""true"" ending. (for an example, see 999 on Nintendo DS)So as you can see, when adapting visual novels into anime, the producers will have to either choose one ending that they want to capitalize on, or somehow cycle through all the endings, with the main character eventually gaining some power that transcends an individual world; because the main character must have the unique ability to remember events that occurred in previous play-throughs. Visual novels usually start out with Question Arcs to build up a mystery, but end with Answer Arcs to explain everything.The nature of being a visual novel makes Chaos;Head differ from true mind-bending anime in that, as the story progresses, the questions will be explained in various ways, usually involving some psycho-(or techno-) babble, and ending with the main character as the only person that could change the world. Cliched, yes. But that's how visual novels go.Chaos;Head, the anime, only goes through the story once. The main character is seemingly paranoid schizophrenic, but does (eventually) develop; in fact, his schizophrenia will play an important role in the plot. Enjoy his psychological breakdown in the first episodes, but later on in the series, you might want to slow down and digest what some of the other characters are rambling about. Several key conversations are essential to understanding the plot, even if they seem ridiculous at first.I must admit, for those of you that are on the fence of whether to get this or not, the sophomoric effort of 5pb/Nitro+ (the authors of the visual novel), Steins;Gate, is a much better anime, not the least because it is twice as long, lending to a more developed plot -- Steins;Gate I consider to be a masterpiece, one of my favorite sci-fi anime. I didn't watch Chaos;Head until after I watched Steins;Gate, and although it's convoluted and a bit more cliche and less imaginative, the personality of the 2 anime are very similar. If you are pessimistic, watch Steins;Gate first, and then decide if you would like more from the same authors.I recommend this anime to those who like to think a bit more than the average person (perhaps you weren't confused when you watched Inception or Donny Darko); it starts off mysterious but ends more or less shounen in the last couple episodes. I feel the shounen aspect is like a darker, more raw, more complicated, more sci-fi oriented version of Star Driver in that the powers that the characters develop have the ability to change the universe as we know it (and of course the final antagonist wants to play God). This is not a spoiler because it's pretty common in anime; par for the course.",4,Make sure you're judging this anime for the correct genre...,1344470400,"08 9, 2012",2012,4350,"['rarely', 'write', 'reviews', ""'m"", 'just', 'not', 'good', 'describing', 'things', 'having', 'just', 'finished', 'watching', 'anime', 'reading', 'reviews', 'are', 'place', 'figure', 'could', 'clear', 'few', 'things', 'up', 'Do', ""n't"", 'worry', 'spoilers', 'First', 'all', 'anime', 'not', 'creepy', 'not', 'aShiki', 'Part', '1', 'Limited', 'Edition', 'Blu-ray/DVD', 'Combo', 'orSatoshi', 'Kon', 'Paranoia', 'Agent', 'Complete', 'Collection', 'Boogiepop', 'Phantom', 'really', 'aim', 'be', 'mind-bend', 'likeSerial', 'Experiments', 'Lain', 'Boxed', 'Set', 'are', 'anime', 'will', 'confuse', 'maintain', 'general', 'atmospheric', 'vibe', 'are', 'sort', 'thing', 'then', 'Chaos', 'Head', 'probably', ""n't"", 'Let', 'be', 'clear', 'would', ""n't"", 'even', 'consider', 'be', 'same', 'genre', 'aforementioned', 'anime', 'anything', 'should', 'be', 'compared', 'successorSteins', 'Gate', 'Complete', 'Series', 'Part', 'One', 'Limited', 'Edition', 'Blu-ray/DVD', 'Combo', 'evenC', 'Control', 'Money', 'Soul', 'Possibility', '[', 'Blu-ray', ']', 'more', 'sci-fi', 'psychological', 'thriller', 'elements', 'psychological', 'thriller', 'sci-fi', 'Chaos', 'Head', 'anime', 'based', 'visual', 'novel', ""'re"", 'unfamiliar', 'concept', 'visual', 'novels', 'are', 'novels', 'usually', 'have', 'text', 'graphics', 'music', 'composition', 'form', 'software', 'have', 'limited', 'interaction', 'sort', 'extremely', 'linear', 'text-based', 'role-playing', 'game', 'Sometimes', 'will', 'be', 'choices', 'make', 'key', 'points', 'story', 'One', 'popular', 'concept', 'visual', 'novels', 'that', 'main', 'character', 'play', 'same', 'world', 'multiple', 'times', 'play-through', 'gather', 'more', 'information', 'world', 'character', 'better', 'decisions', 'leading', 'up', 'true', 'ending', 'example', 'see', '999', 'Nintendo', 'DS', 'So', 'can', 'see', 'when', 'adapting', 'visual', 'novels', 'anime', 'producers', 'will', 'have', 'choose', 'one', 'ending', 'want', 'capitalize', 'somehow', 'cycle', 'endings', 'main', 'character', 'eventually', 'gaining', 'power', 'individual', 'world', 'main', 'character', 'must', 'have', 'unique', 'ability', 'remember', 'events', 'occurred', 'previous', 'play-throughs', 'Visual', 'novels', 'usually', 'start', 'out', 'Question', 'Arcs', 'build', 'up', 'mystery', 'end', 'Answer', 'Arcs', 'explain', 'everything.The', 'nature', 'being', 'visual', 'novel', 'Chaos', 'Head', 'differ', 'true', 'mind-bending', 'anime', 'story', 'questions', 'will', 'be', 'explained', 'various', 'ways', 'usually', 'involving', 'psycho-', 'techno-', 'babble', 'ending', 'main', 'character', 'only', 'person', 'could', 'change', 'world', 'Cliched', 'yes', 'how', 'visual', 'novels', 'go.Chaos', 'Head', 'anime', 'only', 'story', 'once', 'main', 'character', 'seemingly', 'paranoid', 'schizophrenic', 'eventually', 'develop', 'fact', 'schizophrenia', 'will', 'play', 'important', 'role', 'plot', 'Enjoy', 'psychological', 'breakdown', 'first', 'episodes', 'later', 'series', 'might', 'want', 'slow', 'down', 'digest', 'what', 'other', 'characters', 'are', 'rambling', 'Several', 'key', 'conversations', 'are', 'essential', 'understanding', 'plot', 'even', 'seem', 'ridiculous', 'first.I', 'must', 'admit', 'are', 'fence', 'get', 'not', 'sophomoric', 'effort', '5pb/Nitro+', 'authors', 'visual', 'novel', 'Steins', 'Gate', 'much', 'better', 'anime', 'not', 'least', 'twice', 'as', 'long', 'lending', 'more', 'developed', 'plot', 'Gate', 'consider', 'be', 'masterpiece', 'one', 'favorite', 'sci-fi', 'anime', 'did', ""n't"", 'watch', 'Chaos', 'Head', 'watched', 'Steins', 'Gate', 'convoluted', 'bit', 'more', 'cliche', 'less', 'imaginative', 'personality', '2', 'anime', 'are', 'very', 'similar', 'are', 'pessimistic', 'watch', 'Steins', 'Gate', 'first', 'then', 'decide', 'would', 'like', 'more', 'same', 'authors.I', 'recommend', 'anime', 'who', 'like', 'think', 'bit', 'more', 'average', 'person', 'perhaps', 'were', ""n't"", 'confused', 'when', 'watched', 'Inception', 'Donny', 'Darko', 'mysterious', 'more', 'less', 'shounen', 'last', 'couple', 'episodes', 'feel', 'shounen', 'aspect', 'darker', 'more', 'raw', 'more', 'complicated', 'more', 'sci-fi', 'oriented', 'version', 'Star', 'Driver', 'powers', 'characters', 'develop', 'have', 'ability', 'change', 'universe', 'know', 'course', 'final', 'antagonist', 'play', 'God', 'not', 'spoiler', 'pretty', 'common', 'anime', 'par', 'course']",Chaos;Head: The Complete Series

1463242,A39KP1G21J4HUG,B005JJCMQ2,Kiltmaker,"[24, 26]","I would say that this show is for at least older teenagers. The cover blurp would have you think that the reason is violence. BTW, the main on-screen violence is in the first episode and the last two. I believe that the real reason is that it is ostensibly about a delusional, psychotic teenager whose delusions become real. In addition, other people also have delusions, and the delusions have delusions. The result is that in order to properly follow the story, you need to be able to follow what is real and what isn't. Otherwise you will end up being very confused.The story opens with our hero, a teenage otaku, who is living in a metal shipping crate on the roof of a building. He has a sister who visits him periodically, but he spends most of his time with his delusional anime girl-friend. He periodically goes to school. If he isn't gaming, he is doing on-line chatting with his friends. As the story opens there have been two sets of murders.  The pace takes off when someone sends him a pic of a horrific murder. The next day (at night), he witnesses that murder in progress. He sees a girl he doesn't know at the scene covered with blood, with the murder weapons in hand. He runs, and is caught in a surveillance camera, so now the police are searching for him.The next day at school he finds that he is sitting next to the girl, who says that she has known him all his life. Other girls enter the story, one of which says that the hero himself sent the email with the pic of the murder, and others that say he should awaken. Then the girls start carrying swords. Then the EVIL organization enters the action.  Shibuya will never be the same, since it gets pretty well destroyed.The end result is a psycho-thriller, where you are kept wondering what is real and what isn't. If you liked the psycho-thriller Perfect Blue, I think you will like this one also.The package comes with four disks, two DVDs and two Blu-Ray.  I watched the Blu-Ray and the quality was very good.
