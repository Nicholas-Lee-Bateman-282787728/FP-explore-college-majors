Most people compare it to the Borg/McEnroe match of 1980.  Well, I went back and rented that after this thriller and seriously, it's not even close.I had the good fortune of recording this from the third set on; I had errands to run and at this point Federer was down two sets and looked like he was gonna be swept.  Thank GOD I set the recorder to long play because two hours later I was back and RIVETED to the TV, watching the most insanely played back-and-forth I've seen.  The entire match is like a highlight reel.  Incredible shots, winners, rallies, saves, misses... it has it all.  And on and on it goes... you don't want it to end.  And it almost didn't, becoming the longest match in Wimbledon history.When it's finally over, in the darkness, you can't believe what you've just seen.  I've watched it at least 15 times since that day.  Unfortunately when you buy these on DVD, you get the BBC feed with the much more staid play-by-play; on the American side John McEnroe and his team were providing awesome commentary and insight which made it even more classic.  Alas, I believe the BBC owns the rights to all Wimbledon products.That said, commentary or not, the match will thrill you to no end.  The crowd by the third set can barely contain itself and erupts frequently for the rest of the match, especially at the end.  Own it.  It's the best match ever.",5,"Sorry if the DVD Quality is Iffy, But Greatest Match Ever",1245715200,"06 23, 2009",2009,1447,"['tennis', 'fan', 'will', 'never', 'see', 'match', 'life', 'Most', 'people', 'compare', 'Borg/McEnroe', 'match', '1980', 'Well', 'went', 'back', 'rented', 'thriller', 'seriously', 'not', 'even', 'close.I', 'had', 'good', 'fortune', 'recording', 'third', 'set', 'had', 'errands', 'run', 'point', 'Federer', 'was', 'down', 'two', 'sets', 'looked', 'was', 'gon', 'na', 'be', 'swept', 'Thank', 'GOD', 'set', 'recorder', 'long', 'play', 'two', 'hours', 'later', 'was', 'back', 'RIVETED', 'TV', 'watching', 'most', 'insanely', 'played', 'back-and-forth', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'entire', 'match', 'highlight', 'reel', 'Incredible', 'shots', 'winners', 'rallies', 'saves', 'misses', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'end', 'almost', 'did', ""n't"", 'becoming', 'longest', 'match', 'Wimbledon', 'history.When', 'finally', 'over', 'darkness', 'ca', ""n't"", 'believe', 'what', ""'ve"", 'just', 'seen', ""'ve"", 'watched', 'least', '15', 'times', 'day', 'Unfortunately', 'when', 'buy', 'DVD', 'get', 'BBC', 'feed', 'much', 'more', 'staid', 'play-by-play', 'American', 'side', 'John', 'McEnroe', 'team', 'were', 'providing', 'awesome', 'commentary', 'insight', 'made', 'even', 'more', 'classic', 'Alas', 'believe', 'BBC', 'rights', 'Wimbledon', 'said', 'commentary', 'not', 'match', 'will', 'thrill', 'end', 'crowd', 'third', 'set', 'can', 'barely', 'contain', 'erupts', 'frequently', 'rest', 'match', 'especially', 'end', 'Own', 'best', 'match', 'ever']",Wimbledon - The 2008 Finals: Nadal vs. Federer
