195783,A3CDJ2DVD5MZ3C,1929732325,"B. Lovian ""blovian""","[1, 5]","James Earl Jones is great as always.  But the plot stumbles after the boat crashes into the dock.  The story veers into contrived and, by the end, absurd plot developments (the final scene inexplicably has James Earl Jones walking on water).  I think the makers of this movie tried too hard to jam too many liberal dogmas about race relations into one movie.  James Earl Jones walked on water, I suppose, because black people are Jesus-like saviors of white people.  Curiously, Jones is a light-skinned black, but the part seemed to call for a dark-skinned black -- the flashback scenes draw viewers' attention to this discrepancy.",2,"Good Acting, But Story Got a Bit Ridiculous",1151280000,"06 26, 2006",2006,631,"['James', 'Earl', 'Jones', 'great', 'always', 'plot', 'stumbles', 'boat', 'crashes', 'dock', 'story', 'veers', 'contrived', 'end', 'absurd', 'plot', 'developments', 'final', 'scene', 'inexplicably', 'James', 'Earl', 'Jones', 'walking', 'water', 'think', 'makers', 'movie', 'tried', 'too', 'hard', 'jam', 'too', 'many', 'liberal', 'dogmas', 'race', 'relations', 'one', 'movie', 'James', 'Earl', 'Jones', 'walked', 'water', 'suppose', 'black', 'people', 'are', 'Jesus-like', 'saviors', 'white', 'people', 'Curiously', 'Jones', 'light-skinned', 'black', 'part', 'seemed', 'call', 'dark-skinned', 'black', 'flashback', 'draw', 'viewers', 'attention', 'discrepancy']",N/A

It still had that same magic when I had seen it again recently. I could relate easily to this film because I had a similar experience to befriending a person who was twice my age, and I didn't quite understand the concept of racial tones at the time.Not a blockbuster smash, but if you want to watch a made-for-TV Lifetime movie, that has a big name in it, then this movie could be for you. I always love movies like these. Maybe it's the type of person I am, being highly sensitive, movies like these (always bring tears to my eyes).Package arrived on a timely schedule, two weeks prior to its expiration time.

195787,A1AYUY2SXB4JY8,1929732325,Kenneth G. Pittman,"[10, 10]","The tale of Summer's End is about a black man, Dr. William Blakely,  who returns to live in the town where his father was killed by whites when he was a young boy.  The other main character is Jaime, a young boy who strikes up a friendship with Dr. Blakely and is the central &quot;coming of age&quot; figure.  Also key to the plot are Jaime's older brother Hunter, his mother, and his brother's friend Lad.  Lad is a young man brought up to belive what much of the town 'believes' (although only a small handful of Lad's family displays)- blacks are bad and shouldn't be in the town.  It turns into a story of relationships as Lad and his grandfather (mainly) try to run Dr. Blakely out of town.  It keeps your attention the entire time.The acting in the movie is pretty incredible for a TV movie.  James Earl Jones was the perfect casting for Dr. Blakely.  Wendy Crewson plays Jaime's mother very well.  The only acting I wasn't all that fond of was Brenden Fletcher, who played Hunter.  What really stands out though is the acting of Jake LeDoux, who plays Jaime- you have to see it for yourself, but I don't understand why he hasn't landed bigger roles.  Similar to Haley Joel Osment- wonderful at displaying a wide range of emotions.",5,Great story... great acting,1015027200,"03 2, 2002",2002,1238,"['tale', 'Summer', 'End', 'black', 'man', 'Dr.', 'William', 'Blakely', 'who', 'live', 'town', 'where', 'father', 'was', 'killed', 'whites', 'when', 'was', 'young', 'boy', 'other', 'main', 'character', 'Jaime', 'young', 'boy', 'who', 'up', 'friendship', 'Dr.', 'Blakely', 'central', 'quot', 'coming', 'age', 'quot', 'figure', 'Also', 'key', 'plot', 'are', 'Jaime', 'older', 'brother', 'Hunter', 'mother', 'brother', 'friend', 'Lad', 'Lad', 'young', 'man', 'brought', 'up', 'belive', 'what', 'much', 'town', ""'believes"", 'only', 'small', 'handful', 'Lad', 'family', 'displays', 'blacks', 'are', 'bad', 'should', ""n't"", 'be', 'town', 'story', 'relationships', 'Lad', 'grandfather', 'mainly', 'try', 'run', 'Dr.', 'Blakely', 'town', 'attention', 'entire', 'time.The', 'acting', 'movie', 'pretty', 'incredible', 'TV', 'movie', 'James', 'Earl', 'Jones', 'was', 'perfect', 'casting', 'Dr.', 'Blakely', 'Wendy', 'Crewson', 'Jaime', 'mother', 'very', 'well', 'only', 'acting', 'was', ""n't"", 'fond', 'was', 'Brenden', 'Fletcher', 'who', 'played', 'Hunter', 'What', 'really', 'out', 'acting', 'Jake', 'LeDoux', 'who', 'Jaime-', 'have', 'see', 'do', ""n't"", 'understand', 'why', ""n't"", 'landed', 'bigger', 'roles', 'Similar', 'Haley', 'Joel', 'Osment-', 'wonderful', 'displaying', 'wide', 'range', 'emotions']",N/A
