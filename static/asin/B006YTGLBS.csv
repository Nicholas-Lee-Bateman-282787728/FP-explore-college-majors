We have seen some of the episodes before but they never get old and my boys love that they can watch them whenever they want!  The episodes teach great lessons such as community members working together, safety, responsibility, patience and what to do in some emergency situations.

He has watched a few episodes and loves it...but I do notice he has a hard time understanding that British accent. He is 3 years old and understans all his shows with ease (Dora the explorer, wow wow Wubzy, Diego, etc) but this particular series is hard for an American english speaking child living in the states to understand. Just my opinion. No wonder he lost interest and is just watching his other shows.",3,Ok...but hard for Americans to pick up the British accent,1362787200,"03 9, 2013",2013,482,"['son', 'Fireman', 'Sam', '..he', 'anything', 'do', 'fire-rescue', 'watched', 'few', 'episodes', 'do', 'notice', 'hard', 'time', 'understanding', 'British', 'accent', '3', 'years', 'old', 'shows', 'ease', 'Dora', 'explorer', 'wow', 'wow', 'Wubzy', 'Diego', 'etc', 'particular', 'series', 'hard', 'American', 'english', 'speaking', 'child', 'living', 'states', 'understand', 'Just', 'opinion', 'wonder', 'lost', 'interest', 'just', 'watching', 'other', 'shows']",Firemansam Rescue On The Water

Jump in and check out this inexpensive DVD with six episodes and nearly an hour of fun. Each story tells examples of nature and knowledge in this port town. Learn about community helpers that come to the rescue and aid when in need. Gain responsibility from character examples and understand not to go off alone into danger. The animation is fun and the characters friendly. While not all the child character voices are pleasing to the ear, the morals herein are worth every minute of watching.My toddler loves it and I approve.*Thanks to the publicist for providing a copy for review.*",3,Enjoyable with value,1333497600,"04 4, 2012",2012,677,"['Seeing', 'cover', 'first', 'thing', 'toddler', 'mouth', 'was', 'want', 'watch', 'whale', 'Jump', 'check', 'out', 'inexpensive', 'DVD', 'six', 'episodes', 'nearly', 'hour', 'fun', 'story', 'examples', 'nature', 'knowledge', 'port', 'town', 'Learn', 'community', 'helpers', 'come', 'rescue', 'aid', 'when', 'need', 'Gain', 'responsibility', 'character', 'examples', 'understand', 'not', 'go', 'off', 'alone', 'danger', 'animation', 'fun', 'characters', 'friendly', 'not', 'child', 'character', 'voices', 'are', 'pleasing', 'ear', 'morals', 'herein', 'are', 'worth', 'minute', 'watching.My', 'toddler', 'approve', '*Thanks', 'publicist', 'providing', 'copy', 'review', '*']",Firemansam Rescue On The Water
