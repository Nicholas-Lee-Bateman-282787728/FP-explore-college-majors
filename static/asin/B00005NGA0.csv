I have all of his cd's and I still listen to them all.I don't normally like watching live performances on dvd (I'd rather be at the performance persoally), but this is great.  Almost all of my favourites are here and he does some great duets.  Breathe Again was performed with Shanice (who does a great job), Change The World with Eric Clapton and I Care About You (that was done by Milestone in Soul Food).  Also here is Whip Appeal which is one of my all time favourite songs from him from Tender Lover cd.This dvd is probably as close as I'll ever come to seeing this master in concert.  I really enjoyed this and even though I've had it for years, I still watch it a couple of times a year and enjoy it each time as if it were the first time around.",5,Babyface has always been one of my fave's @}->---,1178755200,"05 10, 2007",2007,777,"['still', 'love', 'Babyface', 'have', 'cd', 'still', 'listen', 'all.I', 'do', ""n't"", 'normally', 'like', 'watching', 'live', 'performances', 'dvd', ""'d"", 'rather', 'be', 'performance', 'persoally', 'great', 'Almost', 'favourites', 'are', 'here', 'great', 'duets', 'Breathe', 'Again', 'was', 'performed', 'Shanice', 'who', 'great', 'job', 'Change', 'World', 'Eric', 'Clapton', 'Care', 'was', 'done', 'Milestone', 'Soul', 'Food', 'Also', 'here', 'Whip', 'Appeal', 'one', 'time', 'favourite', 'songs', 'Tender', 'Lover', 'cd.This', 'dvd', 'probably', 'as', 'close', ""'ll"", 'ever', 'come', 'seeing', 'master', 'concert', 'really', 'enjoyed', 'even', ""'ve"", 'had', 'years', 'still', 'watch', 'couple', 'times', 'year', 'enjoy', 'time', 'were', 'first', 'time', 'around']",N/A
