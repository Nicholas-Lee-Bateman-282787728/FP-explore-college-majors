I sometimes show episodes three and four, but time issues limit how much of the series is shown during class. After having students watch episode three, these are some of the major terms/people with definitions that are mentioned throughout the episode:Founding Brothers: Evolution of a Revolution Part III1796: This was the twentieth anniversary of America. There were now sixteen states including Tennessee and Washington stated in September he would not seek a third term.Washington: He decided not to run for a third term in September 1796 and set a two-term presidential tradition. He was the first president and many people now looked at Americans who had Revolutionary credentials.He entered and left Washington as the most revered man in America. He died on December 14, 1799.Adams: He was the first vice-president, a Federalist, and believed in a strong central government. Adams was once good friends with Jefferson, but politics separated their friendship. He became the first president that had to deal with party politics. Although Hamilton was aHe detested and feared Hamilton, although they were both Federalists. He feared the creation of a large standing army because it could be used for tyranny.Jefferson: He was the first secretary of state, a Republican (Democratic-Republican), and believed government should be small. He was once cordial friends with Adams, but this friendship ended because of politics. The Constitution made the second place finisher vice-president because there was no twelfth amendment in 1797. He was considered a French sympathizer.political parties: Federalists and Republicans were the first two organized factions in America. Although not mentioned in the Constitution, party politics began during Washington's presidency. Hamilton was the leader of the Federalists and Jefferson was the leader of the Republicans.Madison: He encouraged his close friend and fellow Republican Thomas Jefferson to run for president against John Adams. He helped write the Kentucky and Virginia Resolutions.cabinet: Adams inherited a cabinet that was more loyal to Hamilton. Washington began the tradition of selecting individuals to lead lead executive departments that would advise the president.Hamilton: He was the leader of the Federalists and an enemy of both Adams. He earned a poor reputation because of an affair with Maria Reynolds. Although he admitted to an affair, he tried to clear his reputation by publishing all love letters. Hamilton wanted to raise an army during the Quasi-War and later was made the second in command by Washington.French Revolution: This revolution was fought between 1789 to 1799 in France. Americans, including Washington, realized that the reason France had allied itself with America during the American Revolution was to possibly regain lost territory. Although Hamilton made sure American debt was steadily repaid to France, the French were disappointed that America did not loan money.Jay's Treaty: This was a treaty signed in 1795 between the United States and Great Britain that promoted ten years of mostly peaceful trade between the two countries. Alexander Hamilton designed most of the terms of the treaty and John Jay was the chief negotiator. Washington gave reluctant support for the treaty. Jefferson and Madison thought the British economic interests would strengthen the Federalists.XYZ Affair: This diplomatic event dealt with strained relations between France and the United States. X, Y, and Z were nicknames given to three French agents,who were later revealed as Jean Conrad Hottinguer, Pierre Bellamy and Lucien Hauteval. The French agents demanded 50,000 pounds sterling, a $12 million loan from the United States, a $250,000 personal bribe to French foreign minister Charles Maurice de Talleyrand, and a formal apology for comments made by President John Adams to continue peace negotiations.Quasi-War: By 1797, Adam's cabinet were crying out for war against France. This war was undeclared and took place between 1798 to 1800. America had to raise an army because of this short war. Some Americans accused Jefferson of being loyal to France. Adams felt a large army could be used for tyranny, but finally raised an army of 15,000 that was led by General George Washington. Alexander Hamilton was made the second in command by Washington during this war. Right at the very end of the war, Adams helped negotiate peace with France.War Hawks: These were congressmen who wanted to raise a 50,000 man army. This term was also used by congressmen who advocated waging war against the British in the War of 1812.Abigail: She offered lots of advise and council to her husband John Adams throughout his presidency and life. She was a very educated and informed woman, but one issue she poorly advised her husband on was his decision to pass the Alien and Sedition Acts.Alien & Sedition Acts: This act sent away foreigners and jailed journalists who criticized elected officials. Fourteen reporters and writers were arrested by 1799 for publishing information against Adams and his administration. Jefferson used these acts to his advantage by charging Adams with being a monarchist. This was a bad term because it compared Adams to King George III. Republicans felt the acts went against the First Amendment and the American system of government. These acts damaged the reputation of John Adams.muckraker: This is often a journalist, reporter, or writer who publishes truthful reports about crime and corruption that often focuses on elected officials and celebrities. James T. Callendar is sometimes referred to as amuckraker because of the salacious content of some of his reporting in the wars between the Federalists and Republicans.Kentucky & Virginia Resolutions: Jefferson and Madison anonymously wrote these resolutions explaining the states had the rights to abolish laws they deemed unconstitutional. Jefferson threatened that Virginia might secede from the union because of the Alien and Sedition Acts.Dec. 14, 1799: This is the day and year that George Washington died. He was 67 and got sick when he was caught in a snowstorm while riding on a five hour trip around his Mount Vernon plantation. It was a date of great mourning because Washington was beloved by Americans, In Philadelphia thousands of people mourned the loss of Washington because of his great leadership during the birth and infancy of the American republic. Henry Lee eulogized Washington by saying, ""To the memory of the Man, first in war, first in peace, and first in the hearts of his countrymen."" Americans were never as unified after the death of Washington.election of 1800: Thomas Jefferson challenged John Adams once again in this election. It was a hotly contested and vicious election because of the libelous statements between Federalists and Republicans. Jefferson was called an intellectualist and Adams was called a monarchist. Adams fired most of his cabinet, which infuriated Hamilton and other Federalists.Aaron Burr: He was a popular New York Senator. He appealed to Federalists and Republicans and it was thought if he ran for the office of president, he would take votes away from Adams. Although it was hoped he would finish second and become vice president, he tied in a 73 electoral with Jefferson, but the Republicans had hoped he would have have been vice president, he remained silent on the issue. He has a questionable reputation and is mistrusted by most of the Founding Fathers. Hamilton did not like Burr and pushed all of his weight towards Jefferson becoming the third President of the United States. In the 36th round of voting in the House, Aaron Burr was elected the vice president.",4,Jefferson the Republican and Hamilton the Federalist,1296086400,"01 27, 2011",2011,7790,"['American', 'history',

Founding Brothers is a documentary from the History Channel that is based on the Pulitzer-Prize winning book by Joseph Ellis.  I would note that there is another DVD collection (created a few years ago by the History Channel) entitled Founding Fathers.Both DVD collections discuss the lives and times of the founding fathers (brothers).  This particular DVD collection starts with post revolution times (i.e constitutional congress - 1820 or so) and really dives into how, once the war was over the bickering and infighting began amongst the founding fathers.  If you are looking for pre-revolution commentary than Founding Fathers is a better DVD collection to pick up as it starts with New England dissent to the winning of the war.1. This DVD collection is well produced.  Famous actors provided the voices for the characters as in Founding Fathers.  Many of the voice overs are done by the same people in both collections.2. While the DVD is certainly worth watching I found myself wishing it had more facts about the economy and its progress but, as the title states, this series is about the founding fathers.3. The series did a nice job of discussing how various fathers had issues with slavery.  It discussed whether they were pro-slavery or against it and how some had serious troubles dealing with it.4. The one thing I thoroughly enjoyed about the DVD collection was that it clearly depicts how each of these men came together despite their different backgrounds and temperaments to found a nation.Most of my reviews are in business / economics and I encourage people to read them, whether here on Amazon or at my personal website. If you are interested in economic history book I would encourage everyone to read The Worldly Philosophers by Robert Heilbroner since it is more international in scope and deals with the lives and times of the most famous economists in history. If you are interested in economic development / evolution of U.S. property history I would encourage you to read Hernando DeSoto's Mystery of Capital but note his lack of focus on corruption in certain countries.

703916,A2VE83MZF98ITY,B0000687BM,"FrKurt Messick ""FrKurt Messick""","[5, 5]","This series is based upon a book by the same title, 'Founding Brothers', by author Joseph J. Ellis, who also has written books on both John Adams and Thomas Jefferson - hence it makes sense that there would be one book that brings the two of them together, along with other movers and shakers of the early American nationhood. Often referred to as 'founding fathers', in fact toward each other, they were more of a brotherhood. Hence Ellis' title.We live in a time where the aging generation has been celebrated as 'the greatest generation', but for this title (and not meaning to take away anything of their achievement) they certain must acknowledge a rival, that being the generation of Americans who lived at the time of the Revolutionary War. Of course, this generation had a sense of greatness about it that made them conscious of what they were doing - George Washington deliberately lived and moved as if his every action would be the stuff of precedent; John Adams had his wife Abigail to begin saving his correspondence long before the outbreak of hostilities in the war.Even with this sense about themselves, according to Ellis, 'Uncertainty, in fact, was the dominant mood at that moment' - the time when the Constitution was being drafted and ratified, there was no clear sense of what was meant by certain of the compromises, particularly the meaning of who 'the people' were in the legal and constitutional sense. If they weren't the federal government or the state governments, then just who were they?Ellis identifies different possible ways of telling the early history of American nationhood, but most simply recapitulate the political debates of the time. Ellis sees these debates and early issues as setting the political stage for ongoing American development. He says, 'the revolutionary generation found a way to contain the explosive energies of the debate in the form of an ongoing argumetn or dialogue that was eventually institutionalised and rendered safe by the creation of political parties.' The issues of the Revolutionary period were not solved by the Constitution and early government development, according to Ellis, but rather enshrined and codified, indeed, woven into the very fabric of the nation as ongoing (and, as Ellis points out, only broke out into warfare during the Civil War).This series develops the narrative across eight major characters, all of whom knew each other rather well. These figures are George Washington, John and Abigail Adams, Thomas Jefferson, James Madison, Benjamin Franklin, Alexander Hamilton, and Aaron Burr. These stories include the famous duel between Hamilton and Burr, a dinner party in which the location of the nation's capital city was decided, and George Washington's farewell address upon declining to run for a third term as president. He also recounts the on-again, off-again friendship and rivalry of Jefferson and Adams, up to the very point of Adams' death - his reported last words were about Jefferson, who died on the same day, in what seems like divinely inspired timing for both: July 4, 1826, the fiftieth anniversary of the birth of the nation.The history is necessarily brief in the series; the book companion is not a lengthy one either - however, history is necessarily selective, and the point of this series seems to be to emphasise the personal relationships and interactions that led to the greater developments of the nation.  The series does gloss over some of the better-known aspects of history to focus more intimately on the central characters and their lives - in such a short space of time, I feel the series has done a very good job at making this period in time come alive for the viewer, and will hopefully stimulate the viewer to read, both Ellis' book and beyond, to learn more about the foundation of the nation.",4,A good series on founding relationships,1129334400,"10 15, 2005",2005,3827,"['series', 'based', 'book', 'same', 'title', ""'Founding"", 'Brothers', 'author', 'Joseph', 'J.', 'Ellis', 'who', 'also', 'written', 'books', 'John', 'Adams', 'Thomas', 'Jefferson', 'hence', 'sense', 'would', 'be', 'one', 'book', 'two', 'together', 'other', 'movers', 'shakers', 'early', 'American', 'nationhood', 'referred', ""'founding"", 'fathers', 'fact', 'other', 'were', 'more', 'brotherhood', 'Hence', 'Ellis', 'title.We', 'live', 'time', 'where', 'aging', 'generation', 'been', 'celebrated', ""'the"", 'greatest', 'generation', 'title', 'not', 'meaning', 'take', 'away', 'anything', 'achievement', 'certain', 'must', 'acknowledge', 'rival', 'being', 'generation', 'Americans', 'who', 'lived', 'time', 'Revolutionary', 'War', 'course', 'generation', 'had', 'sense', 'greatness', 'made', 'conscious', 'what', 'were', 'doing', 'George', 'Washington', 'deliberately', 'lived', 'moved', 'action', 'would', 'be', 'stuff', 'precedent', 'John', 'Adams', 'had', 'wife', 'Abigail', 'begin', 'saving', 'correspondence', 'long', 'outbreak', 'hostilities', 'war.Even', 'sense', 'according', 'Ellis', ""'Uncertainty"", 'fact', 'was', 'dominant', 'mood', 'moment', 'time', 'when', 'Constitution', 'was', 'being', 'drafted', 'ratified', 'was', 'clear', 'sense', 'what', 'was', 'meant', 'certain', 'compromises', 'particularly', 'meaning', 'who', ""'the"", 'people', 'were', 'legal', 'constitutional', 'sense', 'were', ""n't"", 'federal', 'government', 'state', 'governments', 'then', 'just', 'who', 'were', 'Ellis', 'different', 'possible', 'ways', 'telling', 'early', 'history', 'American', 'nationhood', 'most', 'simply', 'recapitulate', 'political', 'debates', 'time', 'debates', 'early', 'issues', 'setting', 'political', 'stage', 'ongoing', 'American', 'development', 'revolutionary', 'generation', 'found', 'way', 'contain', 'explosive', 'energies', 'debate', 'form', 'ongoing', 'argumetn', 'dialogue', 'was', 'eventually', 'institutionalised', 'rendered', 'safe', 'creation', 'political', 'parties', 'issues', 'Revolutionary', 'period', 'were', 'not', 'solved', 'Constitution', 'early', 'government', 'development', 'according', 'Ellis', 'rather', 'enshrined', 'codified', 'indeed', 'woven', 'very', 'fabric', 'nation', 'ongoing', 'Ellis', 'out', 'only', 'broke', 'out', 'warfare', 'Civil', 'War', '.This', 'series', 'narrative', 'eight', 'major', 'characters', 'whom', 'knew', 'other', 'rather', 'well', 'figures', 'are', 'George', 'Washington', 'John', 'Abigail', 'Adams', 'Thomas', 'Jefferson', 'James', 'Madison', 'Benjamin', 'Franklin', 'Alexander', 'Hamilton', 'Aaron', 'Burr', 'stories', 'include', 'famous', 'duel', 'Hamilton', 'Burr', 'dinner', 'party', 'location', 'nation', 'capital', 'city', 'was', 'decided', 'George', 'Washington', 'farewell', 'address', 'declining', 'run', 'third', 'term', 'president', 'also', 'on-again', 'off-again', 'friendship', 'rivalry', 'Jefferson', 'Adams', 'up', 'very', 'point', 'Adams', 'death', 'reported', 'last', 'words', 'were', 'Jefferson', 'who', 'died', 'same', 'day', 'what', 'divinely', 'inspired', 'timing', 'July', '4', '1826', 'fiftieth', 'anniversary', 'birth', 'nation.The', 'history', 'necessarily', 'brief', 'series', 'book', 'companion', 'not', 'lengthy', 'one', 'however', 'history', 'necessarily', 'selective', 'point', 'series', 'be', 'emphasise', 'personal', 'relationships', 'interactions', 'led', 'greater', 'developments', 'nation', 'series', 'gloss', 'better-known', 'aspects', 'history', 'focus', 'more', 'intimately', 'central', 'characters', 'lives', 'short', 'space', 'time', 'feel', 'series', 'done', 'very', 'good', 'job', 'making', 'period', 'time', 'come', 'alive', 'viewer', 'will', 'hopefully', 'stimulate', 'viewer', 'read', 'Ellis', 'book', 'learn', 'more', 'foundation', 'nation']",Founding Brothers

I'll watch the rest, but the primary opinion that I can give you is that I was thoroughly disgusted!I agree with other reviews that I see here in saying that this is EXTREMELY biased towards the Federalists and against the Republicans, who by the way are not clarified as being the Democratic Republicans, not the modern day Republicans although limited government principles are common to both and the modern party was created in 1854 to go back to the principles written in the Declaration of Independence and live by ""All men are created equal"", which IS Jefferson. It is technically a different organization. I believe that if you 1. know a fair amount of founding era history 2. are a Libertarian, Republican or Constitution party member ( I mention these because the common, limited government principles that each hold are clearly what is being attacked through a side door here. ) and/or 3. are a legitimate historian of any political persuasion, you will be stunned at the audacity of this slanted presentation disguised as a historical education product!They also don't even mention the fact that the Federalists took the use of the name from their political opposition (people like Patrick Henry and George Mason) to defeat them, but Jefferson is hammered and hammered for every use of politics. I can tell you this. Because I already know much of this history, I can clearly see how slanted these History Channel presentations are. Luckily, I only spent about 19 bucks for the box set, but that's the LAST money the History Channel will get from me. I will never again view them as a credible source of history. Some of the occasionally inserted ""experts"" did have some credible input, but not all and most of both founding productions show like structured Hit pieces on Jefferson, glorification of the Federalists and almost obscene glorification of Hamilton. This programming puts great effort into painting Jefferson as a political, slave holding hack who unjustifiably accused Hamilton and the Federalists of being advocates of un-necessarily large government with too much power while amazingly skimming over Washington's slaves and totally ignoring Hamilton's five hour speech at the Constitutional Convention that called for a strong national (not federal) government like England's MONARCHY at the time! Jefferson is ripped apart through 4 DVDs (the founding Fathers discs AND the Founding Brothers discs) and all federalists questionable actions are explained with sympathy or not mentioned at all! There isn't even a mention of the slave ""trade"" ending while Jefferson was President (only to be expanded by others later, which is why people who believed that all men are created equal started the Republican party to unite against slavery) People, there are FAR better sources of history than History Channel presentations, no matter how nicely these are packaged. I view these as corrupt educational material.The American Classic series books are a much better place to start if this is new to you. (The Real Thomas Jefferson (American Classic Series)The Real George Washington (American Classic Series)The Real Benjamin Franklin(American Classic Series). The John Adams HBO series is credible too, (including the ""facts are stubborn things"" feature on the discs) and the ""Politically incorrect guide to"" books have great info too. Also check out ""A Patriot's History of the United States"" by Larry Schweikart and Michael Allen. They are all available here on amazon. The bottom line is that you need to read as much of the founders actual words as possible to get the greater picture.",1,VERY VERY SLANTED.

My surprise was great when I realized the beginnings of America resemble a modern day soap opera, with just as much drama and deception.  This production of the History Channel is based on the best-selling book of the same title by historian Joseph Ellis, and presents an intricate, highly political and oftentimes highly manipulative picture of America's first steps towards self-government.The series is four hours long and covers the first three presidents - George Washington, John Adams and Thomas Jefferson - in all their mandates, along with the politics that surrounded not only them as individuals but their cabinets as well.  There is superb acting from the cast in period clothing and a great job has been done in making them look like their alter egos.  The voices of the patriots were entrusted to actors of the caliber of Brian Dennehy, Michael York and Peter Coyote.""Founding Brothers"" provides great insight and scholarly analysis on other politicians of the time as well, those who did not occupy the executive's office, yet had just as much influence in the shaping of the political future of the country.  Thus we have extensive background on Benjamin Franklin, John Jay and Alexander Hamilton to name but a few, this last one a shrewd man, also known as the American Machiavelli, and responsible for the engineering of America's financial system.I don't have anything to say about the quality of the material in the series, which is all discussed by first grade historians and researchers.  I was surprised however, by the charisma and integrity that seemed to have been the distinguishing marks of George Washington, the irascibility that precluded John Adams from becoming an effective leader, and the appalling manipulative and conniving personality of Thomas Jefferson, a man known for having betrayed his closest friends.""Founding Brothers"" presents a picture sometimes hopeful, sometimes disdainful of American politics.

703919,A3ODGAW5Z2EJ1M,B0000687BM,Kevin Currie-Knight,"[79, 91]","In our modern politization of history, people are forced into two groups. The first are those who've only now realized that their larger-than-life image of Jefferson, Washington and the other founders as an uncommonly civil and reasonable bunch is just that, a myth. This group is hurt by this and looks at any attempt to point out the founders weaknesses, internal inconsistencies and what-have-you as nothing less than high slander. Then there is the group that realizes that the founders WERE flawed, contradictory and not quite the proper stuff of legends. This group, though generally out of political spite, not only embraces this fact, but loves to rub any history buff's face in it, pointing to our flawed history as certain proof that America was concieved in shame.This video is refreshing because we get a good dose of amunition for both sides. Starting with George Washington's innaguration, this film takes us through a brilliant story of a people forced to govern from scratch. The film does a good job in pointing out that unlike today, presidents, cabinets, legsilators had no precedents. Who could Washington, Hamilton, the congress who in 1800 dealt with the first election recount in history; none of these, had anyone to look to anyone to see how it was done before. It wasn't done before! We go through the Washington, Adams, and Jefferson presidency; our dealings with France, a new economic system, slavery, and colliding visions of the federalists and the republicans (nowadays these would be termed the republicans and the democrats, respectively). Not quite a Ken Burns film but close!With that said, this film is extemely biased towards the federalists. Whether in the battle of words between Adams and Jefferson, where only Jefferson is made to look hot-headed, or the constant understatement of Madison's intellect (well, that is the republican, not the federalist Madison). If you are like me, an olld whig republican (nowadays called a libertarian or classical liberal) you will be slightly annoyed at oversights like these. Jefferson was by no means a perfect or for that matter, a thorougly respectable individual but this film highlights these flaws while letting Hamilton's slide.The only other quip I have is that the legislature and judicial branch are completely ignored. It's understandable because for a film on the History Channel must focus on what the general public is most interested in and this by far is the executive branch (can you name at least one federal judge?) but it would have been nice once in a while to be reminded of their existence.Altough this film lacks some of the vigor that Founding Fathers had (with the fiery orations by speakers at the Constitutional Convention), it is still thorougly engrossing. It conveys what so few films, books and (PUKE!!) history lessons seem to almost, but never fully, get across; the founders and our history were/was living and breating.",4,Good but slanted intellectual history,1047513600,"03 13, 2003",2003,2935,"['modern', 'politization', 'history', 'people', 'are', 'forced', 'two', 'groups', 'first', 'are', 'who', ""'ve"", 'only', 'now', 'realized', 'larger-than-life', 'image', 'Jefferson', 'Washington', 'other', 'founders', 'uncommonly', 'civil', 'reasonable', 'bunch', 'just', 'that', 'myth', 'group', 'hurt', 'attempt', 'point', 'out', 'founders', 'weaknesses', 'internal', 'inconsistencies', 'what-have-you', 'nothing', 'less', 'high', 'slander', 'Then', 'group', 'founders', 'WERE', 'flawed', 'contradictory', 'not', 'quite', 'proper', 'stuff', 'legends', 'group', 'generally', 'political', 'spite', 'not', 'only', 'fact', 'rub', 'history', 'buff', 'face', 'pointing', 'flawed', 'history', 'certain', 'proof', 'America', 'was', 'concieved', 'shame.This', 'video', 'refreshing', 'get', 'good', 'dose', 'amunition', 'sides', 'Starting', 'George', 'Washington', 'innaguration', 'film', 'brilliant', 'story', 'people', 'forced', 'govern', 'scratch', 'film', 'good', 'job', 'pointing', 'out', 'today', 'presidents', 'cabinets', 'legsilators', 'had', 'precedents', 'Who', 'could', 'Washington', 'Hamilton', 'congress', 'who', '1800', 'dealt', 'first', 'election', 'recount', 'history', 'none', 'had', 'anyone', 'look', 'anyone', 'see', 'how', 'was', 'done', 'before', 'was', ""n't"", 'done', 'before', 'go', 'Washington', 'Adams', 'Jefferson', 'presidency', 'dealings', 'France', 'new', 'economic', 'system', 'slavery', 'colliding', 'visions', 'federalists', 'republicans', 'would', 'be', 'termed', 'republicans', 'democrats', 'respectively', 'Not', 'quite', 'Ken', 'Burns', 'film', 'close', 'said', 'film', 'extemely', 'biased', 'federalists', 'Whether', 'battle', 'words', 'Adams', 'Jefferson', 'where', 'only', 'Jefferson', 'made', 'look', 'hot-headed', 'constant', 'understatement', 'Madison', 'intellect', 'well', 'republican', 'not', 'federalist', 'Madison', 'are', 'olld', 'whig', 'republican', 'nowadays', 'called', 'libertarian', 'classical', 'liberal', 'will', 'be', 'slightly', 'annoyed', 'oversights', 'Jefferson', 'was', 'perfect', 'matter', 'thorougly', 'respectable', 'individual', 'film', 'flaws', 'letting', 'Hamilton', 'slide.The', 'only', 'other', 'quip', 'have', 'legislature', 'judicial', 'branch', 'are', 'completely', 'ignored', 'understandable', 'film', 'History', 'Channel', 'must', 'focus', 'what', 'general', 'public', 'most', 'interested', 'far', 'executive', 'branch', 'can', 'name', 'least', 'one', 'federal', 'judge', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'nice', 'once', 'while', 'be', 'reminded', 'existence.Altough', 'film', 'vigor', 'Founding', 'Fathers', 'had', 'fiery', 'orations', 'speakers', 'Constitutional', 'Convention', 'still', 'thorougly', 'engrossing', 'conveys', 'what', 'few', 'films', 'books', 'PUKE', 'history', 'lessons', 'seem', 'almost', 'never', 'fully', 'get', 'founders', 'history', 'were/was', 'living', 'breating']",Founding Brothers

The DVD is limited in breadth due to time constraints, though it does offer a nice amount of information.  Because there were so many heroes and important figures of this historical time, the film makers chose to focus mainly on a few key people: George Washington, Alexander Hamilton, Thomas Jefferson, and John Adams.  Almost two whole segments are spent, and rightfully so, on George Washington.Nothing new is exposed for well-read historians, but for casual history buffs there are some great details presented.  Interesting analysis, questions, answers, and anecdotes throughout.  We get an insiders view of the events and people.  We see political tactics used by the key players that would make modern politicians shy up.  We get a picture not normally found in text books of the stage set for this experiment.  Washington, for example, after being elected President had an interesting ride from Virginia to Philadelphia in a carriage with a driver so drunk that his baggage was tossed over several times.  Once in Philadelphia, Washington wondered, how should a President act?  After all there was no model.  He had to act important, but not monocratic, a tough thing to do.The filmmakers do a nice job contrasting the Federalist and Anti-Federalist (Republican) differences and the very strong personalities involved.  They do a nice job weaving the relationships in and out as the years progressed.  DVD one starts at the tail end of the American Revolution and DVD two wraps up with the death of Jefferson and Adams on July 4, 1826.  It would be very tough to make a two DVD set that properly covers all the material, events, and people involved with this important time period.  I think the filmmakers did a fine job here.  A one star hit for all but ignoring Franklin's political, philosophical, diplomatic, and social contributions.  Even though Franklin was in his advanced years, his contributions to the development of the young nation were very significant.  Maybe they felt Franklin too overwhelming a figure for this project, I don't know.  Still an effort should have been made.I applaud the material offered and find this to be a worthy set to own and plan to view it many times.",4,Great Companion To The Book,1073088000,"01 3, 2004",2004,2315,"['DVD', 'set', 'combined', 'book', 'same', 'title', 'offers', 'excellent', 'insight', 'birth', 'great', 'Republic', 'DVD', 'limited', 'breadth', 'due', 'time', 'constraints', 'offer', 'nice', 'amount', 'information', 'were', 'so', 'many', 'heroes', 'important', 'figures', 'historical', 'time', 'film', 'makers', 'chose', 'focus', 'mainly', 'few', 'key', 'people', 'George', 'Washington', 'Alexander', 'Hamilton', 'Thomas', 'Jefferson', 'John', 'Adams', 'Almost', 'two', 'whole', 'segments', 'are', 'spent', 'rightfully', 'so', 'George', 'Washington.Nothing', 'new', 'exposed', 'well-read', 'historians', 'casual', 'history', 'buffs', 'are', 'great', 'details', 'presented', 'Interesting', 'analysis', 'questions', 'answers', 'get', 'insiders', 'view', 'events', 'people', 'see', 'political', 'tactics', 'used', 'key', 'players', 'would', 'make', 'modern', 'politicians', 'shy', 'up', 'get', 'picture', 'not', 'normally', 'found', 'text', 'books', 'stage', 'set', 'experiment', 'Washington', 'example', 'being', 'elected', 'President', 'had', 'interesting', 'ride', 'Virginia', 'Philadelphia', 'carriage', 'driver', 'so', 'drunk', 'baggage', 'was', 'tossed', 'several', 'times', 'Once', 'Philadelphia', 'Washington', 'wondered', 'how', 'should', 'President', 'act', 'was', 'model', 'had', 'act', 'important', 'not', 'monocratic', 'tough', 'thing', 'do.The', 'filmmakers', 'do', 'nice', 'job', 'contrasting', 'Federalist', 'Anti-Federalist', 'Republican', 'differences', 'very', 'strong', 'personalities', 'involved', 'do', 'nice', 'job', 'weaving', 'relationships', 'years', 'progressed', 'DVD', 'one', 'tail', 'end', 'American', 'Revolution', 'DVD', 'two', 'death', 'Jefferson', 'Adams', 'July', '4', '1826', 'would', 'be', 'very', 'tough', 'make', 'two', 'DVD', 'set', 'properly', 'covers', 'material', 'events', 'people', 'involved', 'important', 'time', 'period', 'think', 'filmmakers', 'did', 'fine', 'job', 'here', 'one', 'star', 'hit', 'ignoring', 'Franklin', 'political', 'philosophical', 'diplomatic', 'social', 'contributions', 'Even', 'Franklin', 'was', 'advanced', 'years', 'contributions', 'development', 'young', 'nation', 'were', 'very', 'significant', 'Maybe', 'felt', 'Franklin', 'too', 'overwhelming', 'figure', 'project', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'Still', 'effort', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'made.I', 'material', 'offered', 'find', 'be', 'worthy', 'set', 'own', 'plan', 'view', 'many', 'times']",Founding Brothers

And finally, that Thou wilt most graciously be pleased to dispose us all to do justice, to love mercy, and to demean ourselves with that charity, humility, and pacific temper of mind which were the characteristics of the Divine Author of our blessed religion, without a humble imitation of whose example in these things we can never hope to be a happy nation. Grant our supplication, we beseech Thee, through Jesus Christ our Lord.Amen.""On March 4, 1805, President Jefferson offered ""A National Prayer for Peace,"" which petitioned:""Almighty God, Who has given us this good land for our heritage; We humbly beseech Thee that we may always prove ourselves a people mindful of Thy favor and glad to do Thy will. Bless our land with honorable ministry, sound learning, and pure manners.Save us from violence, discord, and confusion, from pride and arrogance, and from every evil way. Defend our liberties, and fashion into one united people the multitude brought hither out of many kindreds and tongues.Endow with Thy spirit of wisdom those to whom in Thy Name we entrust the authority of government, that there may be justice and peace at home, and that through obedience to Thy law, we may show forth Thy praise among the nations of the earth.In time of prosperity fill our hearts with thankfulness, and in the day of trouble, suffer not our trust in Thee to fail; all of which we ask through Jesus Christ our Lord, Amen""President John Adams stated on October 11, 1798:  ""We have no government armed with power capable of contending with human passions unbridled by morality and religion. Avarice, ambition, revenge, or gallantry, would break the strongest cords of our Constitution as a whale goes through a net. Our Constitution was made only for a moral and religious people. It is wholly inadequate to the government of any other.""  ""We recognize no Sovereign but God, and no King but Jesus!""I recommend reading, ""The Light and the Glory"" by Peter Marshal, and ""America's Godly Heritage"" by David Barton.  God Bless.",5,The Greatest Issue...,1240963200,"04 29, 2009",2009,2765,"['Bravo', 'Bravo', 'extremely', 'well', 'done', 'However', 'most', 'important', 'part', 'was', 'not', 'included', 'faith', 'founding', 'fathers', 'were', 'men', 'women', 'who', 'read', 'Bibles', 'daily', 'quoted', 'scripture', 'often', 'were', 'people', 'who', 'prayed', 'knees', 'especially', 'times', 'great', 'peril.Consider', 'George', 'Washington', 'Prayer', 'Nation', 'June', '8', '1783', 'was', 'sent', 'governors', 'states', 'Almighty', 'God', 'make', 'earnest', 'prayer', 'Thou', 'wilt', 'keep', 'United', 'States', 'Thy', 'Holy', 'protection', 'Thou', 'incline', 'hearts', 'citizens', 'cultivate', 'spirit', 'subordination', 'obedience', 'government', 'entertain', 'brotherly', 'affection', 'love', 'one', 'fellow', 'citizens', 'United', 'States', 'large', 'finally', 'Thou', 'wilt', 'most', 'graciously', 'be', 'pleased', 'dispose', 'do', 'justice', 'love', 'mercy', 'demean', 'charity', 'humility', 'pacific', 'temper', 'mind', 'were', 'characteristics', 'Divine', 'Author', 'blessed', 'religion', 'humble', 'imitation', 'example', 'things', 'can', 'never', 'hope', 'be', 'happy', 'nation', 'Grant', 'supplication', 'beseech', 'Thee', 'Jesus', 'Christ', 'Lord.Amen', 'March', '4', '1805', 'President', 'Jefferson', 'offered', 'A', 'National', 'Prayer', 'Peace', 'petitioned', 'Almighty', 'God', 'Who', 'given', 'good', 'land', 'heritage', 'humbly', 'beseech', 'Thee', 'may', 'always', 'prove', 'people', 'mindful', 'Thy', 'favor', 'glad', 'do', 'Thy', 'will', 'Bless', 'land', 'honorable', 'ministry', 'sound', 'learning', 'pure', 'manners.Save', 'violence', 'discord', 'confusion', 'pride', 'arrogance', 'evil', 'way', 'Defend', 'liberties', 'fashion', 'one', 'united', 'people', 'multitude', 'brought', 'hither', 'many', 'kindreds', 'tongues.Endow', 'Thy', 'spirit', 'wisdom', 'whom', 'Thy', 'Name', 'entrust', 'authority', 'government', 'may', 'be', 'justice', 'peace', 'home', 'obedience', 'Thy', 'law', 'may', 'show', 'forth', 'Thy', 'praise', 'nations', 'earth.In', 'time', 'prosperity', 'fill', 'hearts', 'thankfulness', 'day', 'trouble', 'suffer', 'not', 'trust', 'Thee', 'fail', 'ask', 'Jesus', 'Christ', 'Lord', 'Amen', 'President', 'John', 'Adams', 'stated', 'October', '11', '1798', 'have', 'government', 'armed', 'power', 'capable', 'contending', 'human', 'passions', 'unbridled', 'morality', 'religion', 'Avarice', 'ambition', 'revenge', 'gallantry', 'would', 'break', 'strongest', 'cords', 'Constitution', 'whale', 'net', 'Constitution', 'was', 'made', 'only', 'moral', 'religious', 'people', 'wholly', 'inadequate', 'government', 'other', 'recognize', 'Sovereign', 'God', 'King', 'Jesus', 'recommend', 'reading', 'Light', 'Glory', 'Peter', 'Marshal', 'America', 'Godly', 'Heritage', 'David', 'Barton', 'God', 'Bless']",Founding Brothers
