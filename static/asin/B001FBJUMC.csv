With only one original member and them sounding this good, I truly missed out. It is hard for me to grasp a fan of War who saw this CD and not rate it a 5 star. That is baffling. It's understandable if you saw them in their original form. If not, and you are a War fan you have to rate this concert a 5!  This DVD is off da chain!!!!",5,I regret not seeing War,1392249600,"02 13, 2014",2014,426,"['War', 'generation', 'had', 'several', 'chances', 'see', 'top', 'game', 'did', ""n't"", 'only', 'one', 'original', 'member', 'sounding', 'good', 'truly', 'missed', 'out', 'hard', 'grasp', 'fan', 'War', 'who', 'saw', 'CD', 'not', 'rate', '5', 'star', 'baffling', 'understandable', 'saw', 'original', 'form', 'not', 'are', 'War', 'fan', 'have', 'rate', '5', 'DVD', 'da', 'chain']",N/A

The studio versions are typically better.  But, the songs are all stretched out and played in new and interesting ways.I WAS WORRIED THAT THE BAND WOULD BE LAME. The only original member of the band was Lonnie Jordan.  Only one other member of the group, Sal Rodriguez, had been with the band more than 10 years.  I thought that this would either be like a tribute band, or that the musicians would not really be into the songs.  In groups like this, with only one orginal member, the backup guys don't really sound like belong in the band and just throw in solos here and there.  But, in this case, the band sounds very cohesive.It is a concert video, so it includes all of the chit chat.  That isn't good for a CD, but I think it is appropriate for DVD where you want to get a feel for the concert.  It is kind of embarrassing to see the audience, and then have the less than attractive women come up on stage and dance.  But, this is a 40 year old band with 60 year old fans.The filming and editing of the concert was very well done.  It was not like many of the videos today where the camera is always zooming in and out, with all the quick cuts.The audio quality is also very good.  The one thing I don't like is that when you play the concert in 5.1 sound the audience is too loud.  Also, if you do track selection, you can not choose select the audio setup (stereo or 5.1).There aren't any bonus features.",4,Surprisingly good,1234051200,"02 8, 2009",2009,1529,"['WAS', 'WORRIED', 'THIS', 'WOULD', 'BE', 'BAD', 'Usually', 'Greatest', 'Hits', 'live', 'albums', 'contain', 'bad', 'short', 'versions', 'hits', 'studio', 'versions', 'are', 'typically', 'better', 'songs', 'are', 'stretched', 'out', 'played', 'new', 'interesting', 'ways.I', 'WAS', 'WORRIED', 'THE', 'BAND', 'WOULD', 'BE', 'LAME', 'only', 'original', 'member', 'band', 'was', 'Lonnie', 'Jordan', 'Only', 'one', 'other', 'member', 'group', 'Sal', 'Rodriguez', 'had', 'been', 'band', 'more', '10', 'years', 'thought', 'would', 'either', 'be', 'tribute', 'band', 'musicians', 'would', 'not', 'really', 'be', 'songs', 'groups', 'only', 'one', 'orginal', 'member', 'backup', 'guys', 'do', ""n't"", 'really', 'sound', 'belong', 'band', 'just', 'throw', 'solos', 'here', 'there', 'case', 'band', 'very', 'cohesive.It', 'concert', 'video', 'chit', 'chat', ""n't"", 'good', 'CD', 'think', 'appropriate', 'DVD', 'where', 'want', 'get', 'feel', 'concert', 'kind', 'embarrassing', 'see', 'audience', 'then', 'have', 'less', 'attractive', 'women', 'come', 'up', 'stage', 'dance', '40', 'year', 'old', 'band', '60', 'year', 'old', 'fans.The', 'filming', 'editing', 'concert', 'was', 'very', 'well', 'done', 'was', 'not', 'many', 'videos', 'today', 'where', 'camera', 'always', 'zooming', 'quick', 'cuts.The', 'audio', 'quality', 'also', 'very', 'good', 'one', 'thing', 'do', ""n't"", 'like', 'when', 'play', 'concert', '5.1', 'sound', 'audience', 'too', 'loud', 'Also', 'do', 'track', 'selection', 'can', 'not', 'choose', 'select', 'audio', 'setup', 'stereo', '5.1', 'are', ""n't"", 'bonus', 'features']",N/A
