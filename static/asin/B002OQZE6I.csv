I was just a little girl, but had and still have a huge crush on Basil Rathbone. Part of it's nostalgia of course, but I love the film noir quality, the cars and the outfits and the way they talked .  I love the story lines. Nobody else, can ever be SH or Dr. Watson in my mind, these two set the bar too high.  I believe they made about 14 films in this series, and I've got about half of them on DVD. I can watch them over and over, they are classics. These two, are two of my fav. episodes. I esp. love the films that Dennis Hoey is in . He's such a lovable oaf.

Holmes (Rathbone) always treated him with respect and amusement and that made their relationship work.  Both of these movies are filled to overflowing with atmosphere and for me, that's half the fun of watching these oldies but goodies.  THE HOUSE OF FEAR is particularly creepy and quite unsettling at times.  A fantastic double-feature worth every penny.
