As he did with The Civil War and Baseball (as well as his earlier works which are now also in a box set, not to mention The West, New York and Jazz).  Ken Burns continues to present his ""American Stories"" with pictures and narration that bring the past alive.  1 tiny nitpick note however.  This is an 8 not a 7 disc set (for some reason the Jack Johnson story was released on 2 discs rather than a double sided disc like Mark Twain and Lewis and Clark which are of equal length to it).  Other than that, you're getting a good deal on this and it will fit nicely along side the ""America"" box set (or your copies of those individually) and Ken's award winning ""mini series"" (plural).  Get em all, and all other documentaries will just fade away.  Ken Burns is the KING of the modern documentary film.  Keep em coming, Ken, we'll keep buying em (on DVD) :-) Update 10/10/10:  I have just noticed that newer copies of Lewis and Clark on 2 single sided discs rather than a flipper.  So for some of you, this box set may be a 9 bagger (as Mark Twain is still a flipper).

929260,A31BBNT8C62MLU,B000ANVQ50,Trancelucence (Leigh),"[0, 0]","The focus of the first two episodes of Ken Burns's acclaimed series is the friendship between these two great women, from youth to old age and death, punctuated by highlights and lowlights of the women's suffrage movement, which they founded.  Fascinating, the women very different- tiny Stanton ultra-radical, militant; towering Anthony more pacific, pragmatic.  The issues they championed are detailed too, e.g., how women's rights paralleled and yet diverged from abolition and civil rights.  SUCH muddy waters, and as in the 1960s, involving strained relations between women and men within each movement.  The issues involved are complex (likewise involving race relations within the women's movement), and Burns brilliantly, eloquently, GENTLY teases it all apart.This is a quiet, thoughtful production, not exciting, but momentous, we mustn't forget what women like Stanton and Anthony did to help secure women the right to vote.  ""Women's history"" (""herstory"") is given short shrift, considered a specialty area of study in school and college, even today (imagine if the same were true of ""Men's History"", though perhaps that's a redundancy, since the word ""history"" stems from the Greek for wise man and story).  Every school child knows what Abraham Lincoln and Martin Luther King accomplished, securing rights for some 5-15% of the population, why do they not know of Susan B. Anthony and Elizabeth Cady Stanton (and Sojourner Truth), who championed and secured many of the same rights for MORE THAN HALF of the populace?  Perhaps a ""Woman's Day"", a holiday honoring the likes of Stanton & Anthony is in order.  Women have come a long way, but some contend that they've still a considerable ways to go- especially globally, in other countries, some of which are our allies and trading partners, in spite of the fact that women are kept as chattel and scarcely deemed human.  Were MEN being held in such bondage and denied even the most basic of human rights presumably it would be a different story. Anthony and Stanton envisioned the vote as the first step in securing true equality for women.  It hasn't exactly turned out that way.A point of interest: Sweden was the first country that extended voting to women (tradeswomen) in 1718, 200 years before the United States (though it was rescinded in 1771).  Our founding fathers debated and rejected allowing them to vote.  A little known fact is that women fought alongside men in the Revolutionary War, women accompanied the troops as soldiers, cooks, support personnel, and providers of sex, and expected to be accorded equal rights as citizens of the new republic.  No spoiler alert given because Burns's film focuses on Anthony and Stanton, the Civil War era and after.  MUST viewing, in my opinion, I'll say just one thing of the ***SPOILER*** variety: fascinating that the vote in the legislature FINALLY granting women the vote came down ultimately to the vote of just ONE courageous man (a Republican), inspiring.  Burns paints a very detailed, rich portrait of the two women and their cause, as different as night and day, each very special, brilliant in her own way.  A revealing portrait of two extraordinary people, whose work improved the lives of all Americans.  HIGHLY recommended.",5,NOT FOR OURSELVES ALONE:  Susan B.
