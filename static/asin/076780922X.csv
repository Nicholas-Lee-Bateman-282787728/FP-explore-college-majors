8868,ANCOMAI0I7LVG,076780922X,Andrew Ellington,"[1, 1]","I didn't expect to like this movie much at all.  I mean, this is a baseball movie (not a fan) starring Tom Hanks (also not a fan) and yet Geena Davis is amazing in almost everything and the idea of watching her command a film (and a baseball team) had me intrigued.  That, and my wife loves the movie and wanted me to watch it with her.I loved this!Penny Marshall is like the female version of Ron Howard for me.  I've said this before and the more films I see from either of them the more I'm convinced that they personally had/have the market on schmaltzy saccharine dramas cornered.  They just get it.  It is very hard to make schmaltz work, but they do.  Their films are so manipulative and yet I just love them for it.  Other directors try and to the same thing and I chastise them for it, but let Marshall serve up a convulsing De Niro or Howard a penniless Crowe and I'm sold (and bawling).  Here, Penny Marshall uses All-American Girls Professional Baseball as a catalyst for life lessons, familial bonds and comradely.Taking place during World War II, `A League of Their Own' focuses on the birth of the AAGPBL and settles in on a rivalry that forms between two sisters.  Dottie is beautiful and talented and a born leader.  She is also married and satisfied with her life on the farm, waiting for her husband to return from the war so they can start a family.  Her sister Kit is less attractive and less talented, but headstrong and determined to get out of her small town.  Together they are recruited to join the AAGPBL and soon Dottie becomes a star of sorts and her sister becomes envious of the attention showered on Dottie.  With a drunk for a coach (Hanks, in fine form), the team begins to form their own identity, but with the collapse of the league looming overhead (with the war ending, many don't find it necessary) there is more at stake for these women than `a bad game'.The performances by the entire cast are exceptional.  Davis is wonderful, balanced and commanding.  Hanks delivers one of his finer moments, more relaxed and engaged and uses comedic timing to his advantage (he's always been a better comedian than dramatic actor).  Petty is fine in her conflicted aggression and both O'Donnell and Cavanagh serve up prime comedic relief.  Madonna is remarkable here, and may be best in show (with regards to the supporting cast).  I was truly surprised by the depth she brought to her character.The film is wholly entertaining.  It has a great flow and uses such soft touches of style to pull in the film's setting and make it feel lived in and real.  The script is spot on, giving such life to these women and making them a part of our family.  With expert direction, a solid story and an amazing cast, `A League of Their Own' is one for the ages!",5,I'd join this league!,1358899200,"01 23, 2013",2013,2777,"['did', ""n't"", 'expect', 'like', 'movie', 'much', 'mean', 'baseball', 'movie', 'not', 'fan', 'starring', 'Tom', 'Hanks', 'also', 'not', 'fan', 'yet', 'Geena', 'Davis', 'amazing', 'almost', 'everything', 'idea', 'watching', 'command', 'film', 'baseball', 'team', 'had', 'intrigued', 'wife', 'movie', 'wanted', 'watch', 'her.I', 'loved', 'Penny', 'Marshall', 'female', 'version', 'Ron', 'Howard', ""'ve"", 'said', 'before', 'more', 'films', 'see', 'more', ""'m"", 'convinced', 'personally', 'had/have', 'market', 'schmaltzy', 'saccharine', 'dramas', 'cornered', 'just', 'get', 'very', 'hard', 'make', 'schmaltz', 'work', 'do', 'Their', 'films', 'are', 'so', 'manipulative', 'yet', 'just', 'love', 'Other', 'directors', 'try', 'same', 'thing', 'chastise', 'let', 'Marshall', 'serve', 'up', 'convulsing', 'De', 'Niro', 'Howard', 'penniless', 'Crowe', ""'m"", 'sold', 'bawling', 'Here', 'Penny', 'Marshall', 'All-American', 'Girls', 'Professional', 'Baseball', 'catalyst', 'life', 'lessons', 'familial', 'bonds', 'comradely.Taking', 'place', 'World', 'War', 'II', 'League', 'Their', 'Own', 'focuses', 'birth', 'AAGPBL', 'settles', 'rivalry', 'two', 'sisters', 'Dottie', 'beautiful', 'talented', 'born', 'leader', 'also', 'married', 'satisfied', 'life', 'farm', 'waiting', 'husband', 'return', 'war', 'can', 'start', 'family', 'sister', 'Kit', 'less', 'attractive', 'less', 'talented', 'headstrong', 'determined', 'get', 'small', 'town', 'are', 'recruited', 'join', 'AAGPBL', 'soon', 'Dottie', 'star', 'sorts', 'sister', 'envious', 'attention', 'showered', 'Dottie', 'drunk', 'coach', 'Hanks', 'fine', 'form', 'team', 'form', 'own', 'identity', 'collapse', 'league', 'looming', 'overhead', 'war', 'ending', 'many', 'do', ""n't"", 'find', 'necessary', 'more', 'stake', 'women', 'bad', ""game'.The"", 'performances', 'entire', 'cast', 'are', 'exceptional', 'Davis', 'wonderful', 'balanced', 'commanding', 'one', 'finer', 'moments', 'more', 'relaxed', 'engaged', 'comedic', 'timing', 'advantage', 'always', 'been', 'better', 'comedian', 'dramatic', 'actor', 'Petty', 'fine', 'conflicted', 'aggression', ""O'Donnell"", 'Cavanagh', 'serve', 'up', 'prime', 'comedic', 'relief', 'Madonna', 'remarkable', 'here', 'may', 'be', 'best', 'show', 'regards', 'supporting', 'cast', 'was', 'truly', 'surprised', 'depth', 'brought', 'character.The', 'film', 'wholly', 'entertaining', 'great', 'flow', 'uses', 'such', 'soft', 'touches', 'style', 'pull', 'film', 'setting', 'make', 'feel', 'lived', 'real', 'script', 'spot', 'giving', 'such', 'life', 'women', 'making', 'part', 'family', 'expert', 'direction', 'solid', 'story', 'amazing', 'cast', 'League', 'Their', 'Own', 'one', 'ages']",N/A

8871,A1GGOC9PVDXW7Z,076780922X,Annie Van Auken,"[1, 1]","A LEAGUE OF THEIR OWN is the often amusing, sometimes touching biopic of the All-American Girls Professional Baseball League, which was organized in 1942. The story centers on two highly competitive sisters, teammates on the Rockford (IL) Peaches, and their disgruntled, uninterested manager, a former major league superstar who took to the bottle after a career-ending knee injury.After the country is combed for prospects, the fledgling AAGPBL is formed. During games, players must wear outfits with short skirts and are expected to flaunt their charms, but off the field they have to comport themselves like proper ladies. Some calculated publicity along with skillful ballplaying eventually turn the once struggling league into a moneymaking enterprise, but with the war winding down and all the men due home, the girls are expected to return to their former lives. As true competitors however, they won't simply pack it in and go away. Meanwhile, a very exciting season is coming to a close, with the Peaches battling the Racine (WI) Belles for the championship.Several actors enrich this film with talents they bring to otherwise minor roles. David Strathairn's earnest portrayal of a P.R. man who struggles to preserve the girls' league once WWII ends, Pauline Brailsford as prissy Miss Cuthbert, the laugh-out-loud one-liners of league scout Jon Lovitz, Ann Cusack's scatterbrained Shirley Baker, Tracy Reiner's touching performance as 'Betty Spaghetti' and Megan Cavanagh's ultra-shy power-hitting Marla Hooch are particular stand-outs.Parenthetical number preceding title is a 1 to 10 imdb viewer poll rating.(7.0) A League of Their Own (1992) - Tom Hanks/Geena Davis/Lori Petty/Jon Lovitz/Rosie O'Donnell/Madonna/David Strathairn/Garry Marshall/Bill Pullman/T&eacute;a Leoni/Harry Shearer (voice) (uncredited: David L.

Janssen,"[1, 1]","Many Hollywood celebs have said in interviews that comedy and drama lies close together, this movie is definately the proof of that.Baseball is not the national sport here in the Netherlands, and many Dutch people don't even know the rules of the game.Although I know the rules, I wasn't exactly planning to watch this movie because I'm not so interested in this sport.However, since I'm a huge moviefan, I was willing to give this one at least a chance, because I like other Penny Marshall movies like AWAKENINGS, BIG, RENAISSANCE MAN, and I for one think that Penny is a great director.I wasn't sorry at all to watch this movie, and I really was touched by it.I've seen it over 20 times, and I still enjoy it.There is superb acting by Tom Hanks, Geena Davis, Madonna and Rosie O'Donell. Not to be missed Jon Lovitz with great jokes.I was laughing my rear end off when I saw the look on Jon Lovitz' face when the ugly man-like girl had a try-out.But that's one of many times that I had to laugh with this great comedy.And what I think makes the movie very strong is that one moment you're laughing very loud, and the next you want to cry, especially when Tom Hanks graps the bad-news-telegram from the postman, and walks towards one of the girls with the bad news. And they all know what the telegram says.That's a very good scene, and wonderfully edited.What also was great is the black&white; news about the baseball stars changing to color to characters in this movie. It was more like an objective view changing to a subjective view; well done like this, very creative!!The photography is magnificent, and the soundtrack (Madonna's this used to be my playground) really touches you, especially with the older characters in the picture during that music.The characters have depth because of Penny's attention to detail; for instance the ugly girl's father explains that she's so man-like because he raised her as a boy. And his confession makes you feel sorry for this girl, instead of judging her like Jon Lovitz for her looks (another change of feelings).Tom Hanks is also great as the coach, and Penny changes your feelings for him also during the movie; first you hate him, than you love him.

Hooking it on the first year of the All-American Girls Professional Baseball League would have made it worth a watch if only to have even a small taste of an isolated but memorable element of the old ball game during the war era and a short time beyond. But casting Geena Davis and Lori Petty as the sisters around whom the tale revolves was inspired; casting Tom Hanks as the cynical manager was a masterstroke (we tend to forget Hanks's seriocomic virtuosity is as suited for support work as for lead roles); and, given that Penny Marshall is one of the least risky directors in Hollywood, there is an understatement to the film which a) makes it even more affecting, and b) overcomes even the blatant cliche of the championship climax. (Understatement, believe it or not, is also the word for Madonna's surprisingly effective subordinate role as the team party girl; someone should bring a bat down on her head and tell her her best film talent is as a deft supporting comic actress.)

I had bought the first DVD to get the film in the original 2.35:1 widescreen aspect ratio (the pan-and-scan TV version is simply missing too much!), but that was all the first DVD had to offer that was worth anything.  THIS time however, we are treated to a second disc chock FULL of great bonus features!  It has interviews and behind-the-scenes materials, as well as a LOAD of deleted scenes (15 of them in all).  Disc one also has a feature-length commentary track by Penny Marshall and some of the actresses too.What is there to complain about then, you ask?  Well, it has to do with the deleted scenes.  Don't get me wrong, the ones that are here pretty much include everything that was in the later revised draft of the script and fill in some minor holes in the theatrical version (which become more apparent AFTER you've seen these scenes.)  But, there is at least one more scene that was deleted that is NOT presented even here, and I have no idea why.  I do know that the scene was deleted from the script even while some of the others that are on this disc were still present, but the mystery scene MUST have been finished.  The reason why I say that is because a small clip from it was used during the end credits!  It's the scene where Kit was practicing her pitching and Dottie was catching on the edge of the field near the road leading up to their parent's house.  The way it read in the script was that the infamous ""Mitch Swaley"" drove up while they were out there and asked Kit out.  She accepted his invitation, albeit somewhat reluctantly.  The scene obviously belonged right before the existing scene where the two sisters are walking up the drive and Kit was complaining about her strikeout at the game that day.  Note that Dottie is carrying the gloves, and she also ribs Kit about Mitch Swaley liking her.  Since the clip during the credits was clean and finished, doesn't it make sense that the entire scene would be also and could have been included here?  Some of the deleted scenes here were lifted from an early ""working-print"" according to Penny Marshall, and as such they are not as clean and bright as finished scenes are.  I was looking forward to finally getting to see the entire scene that was hinted at in the end credits, but it did not happen for some inexplicable reason.Other than that, this DVD is a dream come true for anyone who enjoys this movie.

The weight of the movie is dependent on  strength of it's characters and those actors who play them, and it is  mostly successful.  Penny Marshall gets great performances from Tom Hanks,  Rosie O'Donnell, Maddonna, David Straithern and the rest of the  team.However, Geena Davis gives a detached performance and this is not  good for the main protagonist.  You get the feeling that her character  Dottie loves baseball, but doesn't really want to be there.  Her sister,  Kit, played by Lori Petty is annoying, but as the role was written, Petty  does a good job.The story on the other hand is pure standard soap opera  cheese.  This puts the challenge on Penny Marshall's shoulders.  While she  does not shy away from the sappy cheese, but she keeps the movie from  becoming derivative.  She gives us interesting characters, whether it's  first billed &quot;All the Way&quot; Mae (Madonna) or secondary characters  like Betty &quot;Spaghetti&quot;, played by Marshall's daughter, Tracy  Reiner.And the ending, while a little bittersweet, and totally coated in  sugar, never feels contrived.

She made the movie, as far as I was concerned as the rest of the cast - although good - was not particularly likable.For instance, Tom Hanks plays a profane, drunken manager, and not a lot of laughs except for famous, ""There is no crying in baseball"" line which has become famous.

Actually, Madonna plays a nice, subdued character and she's okay to watch but, frankly, it's hard for me to warm up to O'Donnell in any role.

That is perhaps its greatest achievement.  As a film, it is a pretty formulaic story of reliable stock characters bonding and enduring adversity with a big showdown at the World Series at the end.  Penny Marshall's direction is efficient, the cast is very good, and the script by Babaloo Mandel and Lowell Ganz provides some good laughs, resulting in an entertaining if conventional Hollywood film.  I was touched more than I expected when the players reunite after many years at the Baseball Hall of Fame in Cooperstown at the end.

8894,A1FDW1SPYKB354,076780922X,David Von Pein,"[78, 82]","The 2-Disc DVD Special Edition of 1992's &quot;A League Of Their Own&quot; (released on April 20, 2004) scores a grand-slam on my DVD Scorecard.  Sporting a fun array of bonus features, a beautiful anamorphically-enhanced widescreen picture, and very clever menu screens, this DVD version of this timeless motion picture is a winner all the way around.Although the film has a relatively-lengthy run time of 2 hours &amp; 8 minutes, it never wears out its welcome or gets tiresome. The first-rate cast sees to that -- a cast that features the likes of Tom Hanks, Geena Davis, Madonna, Rosie O'Donnell, Lori Petty, and Jon Lovitz.Lovitz is fall-down hilarious as the scout who plucks Geena and Lori off of their Oregon farm to join the first professional girls' baseball league. He offers up one zinger after another during his short stint in this movie, such as his explanation to the other girls as to why he can't sign up second baseman Marla Hooch (who isn't likely to win the Miss America Pageant anytime soon) -- &quot;You know General Omar Bradley? Well, there's too strong a resemblance.&quot;DVD Special Features for the 2-Disc &quot;Special Edition&quot; ..............&gt;&gt; A very nice 52-minute documentary on the making of the film, &quot;Nine Memorable Innings&quot;, featuring new interviews with the cast and crew, and some behind-the-scenes footage.&gt;&gt; 15 Deleted Scenes. Many of these cut scenes flesh out some of the movie's shorter scenes. Some very interesting stuff here too. You can play each of these scenes separately, or via a &quot;Play All&quot; option. And these can be played with or without a &quot;Director's Introduction&quot; preceding each clip from Penny Marshall.  Total run time: 36:02 with intros, or 32:39 without them.&gt;&gt; Commentary Track, with Director Penny Marshall and some of the cast members.&gt;&gt; 3 Trailers -- Including the excellent and funny trailer for this movie, plus bonus trailers for two other sports films (&quot;Brian's Song&quot; and &quot;The Natural&quot;).&gt;&gt; Madonna Music Video -- &quot;This Used To Be My Playground&quot; (run time: 5:02).&gt;&gt; Cast &amp; Crew Filmographies (text only).&gt;&gt; A French Language Track (in 2.0 Dolby Surround).&gt;&gt; English Subtitles.VIDEO -- The movie is presented on Disc #1 (which is dual-sided with no disc art), with Side A being the Widescreen (2.35:1 aspect ratio) version and Side B being a Full-Screen (1.33:1) Pan-and-Scan version.  Now why anybody on the planet would prefer the Full-Screen (aka: &quot;butchered all to hell&quot;) variant is beyond my comprehension. (Especially a super-wide 2.35:1 ratio film like this one, where, in the 1.33:1 version you're missing about 45% of the screen image at all times.)  But, to each his own.  IMO, however, the Widescreen is the ONLY way to go here (or with any other movie, for that matter).The Widescreen transfer here looks A-1. Very clear, no &quot;jaggies&quot; in the background that I could see, with great color.AUDIO -- The box shows a &quot;4.0 Surround&quot; English audio track.  But my Player reads the sound as &quot;3.1 Dolby Digital&quot;. Kind of strange, I thought.  But, regardless of the individual number of discrete channels here, it sounds great. The previous DVD version of this movie was done in 2.0 Dolby Surround; and this SE is at least up to par with that older disc, IMO.MENUS -- A really well-done &quot;baseball-themed&quot; Menu design here. The &quot;Scene Selection&quot; screens are designed so that each scene choice looks like a baseball card, complete with an &quot;AAGPBL&quot; (&quot;All-American Girls Professional Baseball League&quot;) logo in the corner. Also shown on each of the Chapter screens is a simulated &quot;baseball card&quot; featuring one of the &quot;players&quot; (or manager) that appears in the movie.The Main Menu for disc #2, which holds all the bonus material, is cleverly laid out to represent a page of a newspaper, with the menu choices integrated into the &quot;headlines&quot; of the paper.  Very cool. As is the disc art for the second disc, which is made up to look like a baseball.This flick beckons to be viewed a minimum of once per year. And perhaps even more frequently thanks to this fine two-disc SE that is now available.  It's a movie that is just plain fun to sit through. And that's not likely to change, even many years down the road.&quot;A League Of Their Own&quot; will remain in a class all its own for a long, long time to come.",5,Good-Looking 2-Disc Special Edition!,1083110400,"04 28, 2004",2004,4499,"['2-Disc', 'DVD', 'Special', 'Edition', '1992', 'quot', 'A', 'League', 'Their', 'Own', 'quot', 'released', 'April', '20', '2004', 'grand-slam', 'DVD', 'Scorecard', 'Sporting', 'fun', 'array', 'bonus', 'features', 'beautiful', 'anamorphically-enhanced', 'widescreen', 'picture', 'very', 'clever', 'menu', 'screens', 'DVD', 'version', 'timeless', 'motion', 'picture', 'winner', 'way', 'film', 'relatively-lengthy', 'run', 'time', '2', 'hours', 'amp', '8', 'minutes', 'never', 'out', 'welcome', 'tiresome', 'first-rate', 'cast', 'sees', 'cast', 'likes', 'Tom', 'Hanks', 'Geena', 'Davis', 'Madonna', 'Rosie', ""O'Donnell"", 'Lori', 'Petty', 'Jon', 'Lovitz.Lovitz', 'fall-down', 'hilarious', 'scout', 'who', 'Geena', 'Lori', 'Oregon', 'farm', 'join', 'first', 'professional', 'girls', 'baseball', 'league', 'up', 'one', 'zinger', 'short', 'stint', 'movie', 'such', 'explanation', 'other', 'girls', 'why', 'ca', ""n't"", 'sign', 'up', 'second', 'baseman', 'Marla', 'Hooch', 'who', ""n't"", 'likely', 'win', 'Miss', 'America', 'Pageant', 'anytime', 'soon', 'quot', 'know', 'General', 'Omar', 'Bradley', 'Well', 'too', 'strong', 'resemblance.', 'quot', 'DVD', 'Special', 'Features', '2-Disc', 'quot', 'Special', 'Edition', 'quot', '..', 'gt', 'gt', 'very', 'nice', '52-minute', 'documentary', 'making', 'film', 'quot', 'Nine', 'Memorable', 'Innings', 'quot', 'featuring', 'new', 'interviews', 'cast', 'crew', 'behind-the-scenes', 'footage.', 'gt', 'gt', '15', 'Deleted', 'Scenes', 'Many', 'cut', 'scenes', 'flesh', 'movie', 'shorter', 'scenes', 'very', 'interesting', 'stuff', 'here', 'too', 'can', 'play', 'scenes', 'separately', 'quot', 'Play', 'All', 'quot', 'option', 'can', 'be', 'played', 'quot', 'Director', 'Introduction', 'quot', 'preceding', 'clip', 'Penny', 'Marshall', 'Total', 'run', 'time', '36:02', 'intros', '32:39', 'them.', 'gt', 'gt', 'Commentary', 'Track', 'Director', 'Penny', 'Marshall', 'cast', 'members.', 'gt', 'gt', '3', 'Trailers', 'Including', 'excellent', 'funny', 'trailer', 'movie', 'bonus', 'trailers', 'two', 'other', 'sports', 'films', 'quot', 'Brian', 'Song', 'quot', 'quot', 'Natural', 'quot', 'gt', 'gt', 'Madonna', 'Music', 'Video', 'quot', 'Used', 'Be', 'My', 'Playground', 'quot', 'run', 'time', '5:02', 'gt', 'gt', 'Cast', 'amp', 'Crew', 'Filmographies', 'only', 'gt', 'gt', 'A', 'French', 'Language', 'Track', '2.0', 'Dolby', 'Surround', 'gt', 'gt', 'English', 'Subtitles.VIDEO', 'movie', 'presented', 'Disc', '1', 'dual-sided', 'disc', 'art', 'Side', 'A', 'being', 'Widescreen', '2.35:1', 'aspect', 'ratio', 'version', 'Side', 'B', 'being', 'Full-Screen', '1.33:1', 'Pan-and-Scan', 'version', 'Now', 'why', 'anybody', 'planet', 'would', 'prefer', 'Full-Screen', 'aka', 'quot', 'butchered', 'hell', 'quot', 'variant', 'comprehension', 'Especially', 'super-wide', '2.35:1', 'ratio', 'film', 'one', 'where', '1.33:1', 'version', ""'re"", 'missing', '45', '%', 'screen', 'image', 'times', 'own', 'IMO', 'however', 'Widescreen', 'ONLY', 'way', 'go', 'here', 'other', 'movie', 'matter', 'Widescreen', 'transfer', 'here', 'A-1', 'Very', 'clear', 'quot', 'jaggies', 'quot', 'background', 'could', 'see', 'great', 'color.AUDIO', 'box', 'quot', '4.0', 'Surround', 'quot', 'English', 'track', 'Player', 'sound', 'quot', '3.1', 'Dolby', 'Digital', 'quot', 'Kind', 'strange', 'thought', 'regardless', 'individual', 'number', 'discrete', 'channels', 'here', 'great', 'previous', 'DVD', 'version', 'movie', 'was', 'done', '2.0', 'Dolby', 'Surround', 'SE', 'least', 'up', 'par', 'older', 'disc', 'IMO.MENUS', 'really', 'well-done', 'quot', 'baseball-themed', 'quot', 'Menu', 'design', 'here', 'quot', 'Scene', 'Selection', 'quot', 'screens', 'are', 'designed', 'scene', 'choice', 'baseball', 'card', 'complete', 'quot', 'AAGPBL', 'quot', 'quot', 'All-American', 'Girls', 'Professional', 'Baseball', 'League', 'quot', 'logo', 'corner', 'Also', 'shown', 'Chapter', 'screens', 'simulated', 'quot', 'baseball', 'card', 'quot', 'featuring', 'one', 'quot', 'players', 'quot', 'manager', 'movie.The', 'Main', 'Menu', 'disc', '2', 'bonus', 'material', 'cleverly', 'laid', 'out', 'represent', 'page', 'newspaper', 'menu', 'choices', 'integrated', 'quot', 'headlines', 'quot', 'paper', 'Very', 'cool', 'disc', 'art', 'second', 'disc', 'made', 'up', 'look', 'baseball.This', 'flick', 'beckons', 'be', 'viewed', 'minimum', 'once', 'year', 'perhaps', 'even', 'more', 'frequently', 'fine', 'two-disc', 'SE', 'now', 'available', 'movie', 'just', 'plain', 'fun', 'sit', 'not', 'likely', 'change', 'even', 'many', 'years', 'down', 'road.', 'quot', 'A', 'League', 'Their', 'Own', 'quot', 'will', 'remain', 'class', 'own', 'long', 'long', 'time', 'come']",N/A

I had seen it years ago and recently bought my own copy of it.  This movie is one of the best that Penny Marshall has ever directed.  The casting was superb.  Madonna and Rosie O'Donnell were perfect as street-wise, but loveable May and Doris!  Geena Davis did a wonderful job playing Dottie Henson, who had a genuine love for the game, yet had responsibilities and priorities that were more important to her.  Lori Petty was great as Kit, Dottie's little sister who fought so hard to get out from under her sister's shadow.  Marla Hooch, what a great character!! Evelyn and her little boy Stillwell &quot;Angel&quot; will keep you in smiling all the time you want to bean him with a baseball bat.  Ellen Sue, Helen, Betty Spaghetti, I feel like I know them all!! And Tom Hanks plays one of his best roles ever, as Jimmy Duggan, an ex-ball player turned coach.  Not too thrilled with the job of coaching &quot;girls&quot;, he accepts the job and finally comes to respect them as a team and as baseball players.  I think one of the best parts of the movies is when the ball players reunite after 40 years and the casting of the older woman to play the parts of the aging ball players is a masterpiece.  It is remarkable how these older &quot;look-alikes&quot; were all brought into this movie.  This is a movie worth watching, owning and recommending.  Very few come along in a lifetime that provide so much good, positive entertainment, but this movie has it all.

8896,AOYTQFRLD8VLP,076780922X,Deborah Earle,"[2, 2]","Penny Marshall's 1992 directorial offering introduced many to a forgotten chapter of American Sports History: The creation of the All American Girls Professional Baseball League in response to the man shortage caused by World War II.This event culminates to a point in the story that begins decades later when the recently widowed Dottie Hinson(Lynn Cartwright)is persuaded by her daughter, Margaret(Blaine Baron) to attend the opening of a museum exhibit honoring the women of the League. After some misgivings, she agrees to go, but as she leaves, she warns her older grandson, Jeffrey(Ryan Howell) to let his younger brother, Bobby(Brian Boru Gleeson) get a few shots in during their basketball game because he is smaller and has less of an advantage. To her younger, scrappier grandson, she gives even more practical advice based on her own experience with sibling rivalry:""Kill him!""As she is en route to the reunion, we travel back in time to the early 1940s  where Dottie is a young farm wife(Geena Davis) who works at a local dairy, helps out on her family farm, and along with her younger sister, Kit(Lori Petty), plays baseball on the Lukash Dairy team while awaiting her husband's return from the war.After playing a game in which Dottie wins the day, Kit laments her lost chance at being the heroine, and  as well as constantly playing second fiddle to her older sister.But their fates are about to change. Ernie Capadino(Jon Lovitz), a talent scout who saw the game offers Dottie a chance to try out for the League. Initially reluctant to accept based on the conditions, she is prodded to do so by Kit, who has been denied the same offer because of her failure to impress Capadino during the game. Capadino agrees to let Kit come only if Dottie comes with her.Eager to leave Oregon because she sees no future in staying where she is, Kit does convince her sister to come along, and both meet the train out of town the next morning.They suffer Capadino's crudeness all the way to Colorado, where they encounter Marla Hooch(Megan Cavanagh), whose father, Dave(Eddie Jones), is a baseball coach. She proves to be a fantastic hitter, but is nearly rejected by Capadino because he considers her unattractive. The protestations of Kit and Dottie make him change his mind.As Capadino delivers the recruits at Wrigley Field, we hear the criticism of social commentator, Maida Gillespie(Laurel Cronin), who objects to candy bar company/baseball club owner, Walter Harvey's (Garry Marshall-whose real-life counterpart was chewing gum manufacturer Phillip Wrigley)""masculinization"" of women by ""plucking girls from their homes"" for this pursuit, which she claims is ""detrimental to the home, the children the family, and the country"".The Maida Gillespies of this world have to be forgiven for being products of their time. As our story further unfolds, we see how this groundbreaking feat gives young women an opportunity for growth they otherwise may not have had.Ann Cusack's Shirley Baker, whose illiteracy nearly cost her her chance to be on the Rockford Peaches' team learns to read, the tough New Yorkers, Mae Mordabito(Madonna) and Doris Murphy(Rosie O'Donnell), become slightly more refined, and have a chance for  a more respectable job than the ones they held previously, and when Doris severs ties with a boyfriend who mistreats her, we see how girls' involvement in sports  makes them less tolerant of abusive relationships.Don Davis' Charlie Collins, coach of the Racine Belles, initiates those accepted for the various teams, along with pitchman Ira Lowenstein(David Straithairn).To coach the Rockford Peaches, Harvey recruits former Baseball great, Jimmy Dugan(Tom Hanks--whose real-life-counterpart is Jimmy Foxx), whose career took a nosedive due to his alcoholism, but who has enough star power to attract a crowd.Dugan is extremely apprehensive about the venture due to Neanderthal views of the opposite sex.But little does he realize how a working relationship with women will change him forever.To appease social critics, the young women take etiquette lessons, and beautify themselves. Even then, when Ellie Weingardt's charm school instructor, inspects her students in a lineup, she is more complimentary of Dottie than of Kit, who is at least spared her thumbs-down review of shy and homely, Marla, who will blossom in due time.Other players include, left-fielder, Betty ""Spaghetti"" Horn(Marshall's daughter, Tracy Reiner), a charismatic and assertive 1st basewoman, Helen Hayley (Anne Ramsay), the superstitious left-and centerfielder, Alice Gaspers(Renee Coleman), Kelly Simkins' outfielder, Beverly Dixon, Freddie Simpson's ex-Miss Georgia and current shortstop, Ellen Sue Gotlander, and Bitty Schram's right-fielder/pitcher, Evelyn Gardner, who is compelled to bring her hellion son Stilwell(Justin Scheller) with her on the cross-country trek, yet manages to write a song honoring the League.Pauline Brailsford's Miss Cuthbert is the team's chaperone, who monitors her charges during church services, pleads fruitlessly with an irate bus driver pushed over the edge by Stilwell's antics, endures insults and backside slaps from Dugan,  has her dinner poisoned by Mae so the girls can slip out and go to a bar, and comforts a young player who learns the grim fate of a husband fighting in the Pacific via telegram.Dugan's initial meeting with the players is less than cordial. In reality the women would not have stood for his crude antics and would have bodily thrown him out of the locker room.Dottie again takes charge when Dugan fails to give them a lineup during their first game(which he is too soused to watch although the announcer gives him credit for the team's performance). During their first game, the camera pans the line of nervous women facing a less-than friendly crowd, amid beauty pageant contestant Ellen Sue's advice, ""Just keep smiling!"" It will be her fastball that knocks a heckler(Joe Krowka) back in line as she gives the coy explanation that ""It slipped!"", retaining feminine modesty despite aggression.Tensions increase between Dottie and Kit when the latter still finds herself in her sister's shadow, amid the news that Mr. Harvey may discontinue the League if Lowenstein can't find a way to save it. The ultimate result is Kit's being traded to Racine, knowing that her sister is considered a better player and those in charge would never trade their precious ""Queen of Diamonds"".A moment of locker room camaraderie is shattered when one of the kindest players, who, like may women with spouses away at war, did her best to keep up morale, receives her husband's death notice and Dottie realizes how close she came to being the recipient of that telegram.But fortune turns in her favor and she decides to return to Oregon despite chastisement by Dugan.Her return to play in the World Series will lead to a stunning climax.Watch for Tea Leoni in a supporting role, and Michael Hayley as an empathetic umpire, who encourages Dugan to soften his manner in dealing with the ladies.A few of Marshall's ""Laverne and Shirley"" co-stars make cameo appearances-- David L. Lander as an announcer, and Eddie Mekka as a soldier in a bar. Marshall's niece, Kathleen is one of the ball players.Gradually, Dottie arrives at the reunion amid moments of comedy and poignancy, as does Kit (Kathleen Butler) who brings her spouse, children, and grandchildren to the Baseball Hall of Fame exhibit, happy and on an equal footing with Dottie at last. The sentimentality of those old ladies is truly endearing, and they still play ball with the same spark of fire they had in their youth.Nearly a decade earlier ""Swing Shift"" told the story of how women stoked the fires of the industrial homefront. ""A League of Their Own"" brilliantly depicts how women  of that era kept baseball--that staple of American sports-- afloat, adding dimension to their own lives, paving the way for future female athletes, and earning the respect of the men who worked with them.",5,"Pioneering Athletes, Sibling Rivalry, and Something to Show the Grandchildren!",1278201600,"07 4, 2010",2010,7996,"['Penny',

8900,ABN5K7K1TM1QA,076780922X,Dennis Littrell,"[25, 36]","This movie is about ten times better than it has any right to be considering how sappy director Penny Marshall could have been tempted to make it, and how phony is the actual baseball played by the young women. (More on this below.)What makes it work are fine performances by Geena Davis as catcher Dottie Hinson, &quot;the best player in the league,&quot; and Lori Petty as her younger sister, Kit Keller. Geena Davis absolutely looks the part with her cool confidence and stately figure while Lori Petty is scrappy and believable as the little sister whose puck and determination set the stage for a sister-rivalry climax at the end.Jon Lovitz as Ernie Capadino, the baseball talent scout, is a crackup as he delivers just about all the best one liners. (Example: he's watching Dottie and Kit milk the cows and asks, &quot;Doesn't that hurt them?&quot; Geena shrugs for the city slicker, &quot;They don't seem to mind.&quot; Ernie thinks about it and then says, &quot;Well, it would bruise the heck out of me,&quot; which was doubly funny since he has his anatomy confused.) But the guy who really holds the whole thing together is Tom Hanks as one-time home run king Jimmy Dugan, who is now the Rockford Peaches' alcoholic manager. I have seen Tom Hanks in a number of films, but I don't think he was ever any better than he is here. His transformation from a crude, uncaring drunk to the team's hard-nosed but soft-hearted leader is very well and believably done. And Hanks was never more charming and seldom funnier.Just as good as the work of the fine cast is Marshall's clear, old-fashioned direction. In many ways this film is a throwback to an earlier time when films set out to warm the hearts of the audience and uplift their spirits. Sure, there is evil in the world and you can't win them all, but you can try, is what this film makes us feel, and if you do, something good will happen. There is of course a somewhat self-conscious retrospective look at the sorry political and social state of women sixty years ago, but Marshall does not wallow in the politics. Instead she emphasizes a fun-to-watch tale with real human characters. The unpredictable, but believable ending was very agreeable.Okay now to some of the problems with the &quot;baseball.&quot; Notice that we first see Kit as a softball pitcher. How she made the transition from throwing underhanded to being one of the best overhand hardball throwers in the league in just a few months is...well, doubtful. And the outfits they wore! Ever try to slide into second trying to break up the double play without sliding pads or even jersey pants? I don't think so. The girls were bare-legged. To Marshall's credit she does show one girl with a huge strawberry bruise on her thigh. Furthermore for those viewers who have actually played baseball, the way many of the young women threw and caught the ball was again, shall we say, doubtful. Marshall employed as extras some young ladies who could actually play a little and we see some shots of their style and grace, but the only star who could even pretend to play at that level would be Rosie O'Donnell. Madonna has some athletic ability, but to imagine her patrolling center field and hauling down long drives strains credibility.Okay, so what? If we put Tom Hanks at bat against even the most mediocre of Class A pitchers, it would be obvious that he is no home run king. In fact, I think Penny Marshall did a great job of creating and maintaining the illusion of Big League skills for the players so that we were not distracted from the story itself. Skillful editing helped.By the way, if they gave Academy Awards for a performance in a role short of a supporting role but longer than a cameo (and maybe they should), Megan Cavanagh would have won it for her touching impersonation of Marla Hooch, a painfully shy and vulnerable, less than pretty girl from the farm who finds herself as a baseball player in the city as she steals some guy's heart with an unselfconscious, boozy, off-key torch song. I also loved the scene where she is rocketing line drives off the walls and through the windows of the high school gymnasium.Note the appearance of David L. Lander as the radio play-by-play guy. He's best known as the wacky/creepy &quot;Squiggy&quot; Squiggman from the old Laverne and Shirley TV sit-com. Here he plays it mostly straight but does get to wear his hat with the bill up as Leo Gorcey did in the East Side Kids (AKA The Bowery Boys) movies from the early forties.Bottom line here: Uplifting, fun, and even worth seeing again.",4,"Stylish, warm and fun to watch",1090281600,"07 20, 2004",2004,4567,"['movie', 'about', 'ten', 'times', 'better', 'right', 'be', 'considering', 'how', 'sappy', 'director', 'Penny', 'Marshall', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'tempted', 'make', 'how', 'phony', 'actual', 'baseball', 'played', 'young', 'women', 'More', 'below', 'What', 'are', 'fine', 'performances', 'Geena', 'Davis', 'catcher', 'Dottie', 'Hinson', 'quot', 'best', 'player', 'league', 'quot', 'Lori', 'Petty', 'younger', 'sister', 'Kit', 'Keller', 'Geena', 'Davis', 'absolutely', 'part', 'cool', 'confidence', 'stately', 'figure', 'Lori', 'Petty', 'scrappy', 'believable', 'little', 'sister', 'puck', 'determination', 'set', 'stage', 'sister-rivalry', 'climax', 'end.Jon', 'Lovitz', 'Ernie', 'Capadino', 'baseball', 'talent', 'scout', 'crackup', 'just', 'best', 'one', 'liners', 'Example', 'watching', 'Dottie', 'Kit', 'milk', 'cows', 'asks', 'quot', ""n't"", 'that', 'hurt', 'quot', 'Geena', 'shrugs', 'city', 'slicker', 'quot', 'do', ""n't"", 'seem', 'mind.', 'quot', 'Ernie', 'then', 'quot', 'Well', 'would', 'bruise', 'heck', 'quot', 'was', 'doubly', 'funny', 'anatomy', 'confused', 'guy', 'who', 'really', 'whole', 'thing', 'together', 'Tom', 'Hanks', 'one-time', 'home', 'run', 'king', 'Jimmy', 'Dugan', 'who', 'now', 'Rockford', 'Peaches', 'alcoholic', 'manager', 'have', 'seen', 'Tom', 'Hanks', 'number', 'films', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'was', 'ever', 'better', 'here', 'transformation', 'crude', 'uncaring', 'drunk', 'team', 'hard-nosed', 'soft-hearted', 'leader', 'very', 'well', 'believably', 'done', 'Hanks', 'was', 'never', 'more', 'charming', 'seldom', 'funnier.Just', 'as', 'good', 'work', 'fine', 'cast', 'Marshall', 'clear', 'old-fashioned', 'direction', 'many', 'ways', 'film', 'throwback', 'earlier', 'time', 'when', 'films', 'set', 'out', 'warm', 'hearts', 'audience', 'uplift', 'spirits', 'Sure', 'evil', 'world', 'ca', ""n't"", 'win', 'can', 'try', 'what', 'film', 'feel', 'do', 'something', 'good', 'will', 'happen', 'course', 'somewhat', 'self-conscious', 'retrospective', 'look', 'sorry', 'political', 'social', 'state', 'women', 'sixty', 'years', 'ago', 'Marshall', 'not', 'wallow', 'politics', 'Instead', 'fun-to-watch', 'tale', 'real', 'human', 'characters', 'unpredictable', 'believable', 'ending', 'was', 'very', 'agreeable.Okay', 'now', 'problems', 'quot', 'quot', 'Notice', 'first', 'see', 'Kit', 'softball', 'pitcher', 'How', 'made', 'transition', 'throwing', 'underhanded', 'being', 'one', 'best', 'overhand', 'hardball', 'throwers', 'league', 'just', 'few', 'months', 'well', 'doubtful', 'outfits', 'wore', 'Ever', 'try', 'slide', 'second', 'trying', 'break', 'up', 'double', 'play', 'sliding', 'pads', 'even', 'jersey', 'pants', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'so', 'girls', 'were', 'bare-legged', 'Marshall', 'credit', 'show', 'one', 'girl', 'huge', 'strawberry', 'bruise', 'thigh', 'Furthermore', 'viewers', 'who', 'have', 'actually', 'played', 'baseball', 'way', 'many', 'young', 'women', 'threw', 'caught', 'ball', 'was', 'again', 'shall', 'say', 'doubtful', 'Marshall', 'employed', 'extras', 'young', 'ladies', 'who', 'could', 'actually', 'play', 'little', 'see', 'shots', 'style', 'grace', 'only', 'star', 'who', 'could', 'even', 'pretend', 'play', 'level', 'would', 'be', 'Rosie', ""O'Donnell"", 'Madonna', 'athletic', 'ability', 'imagine', 'patrolling', 'center', 'field', 'hauling', 'down', 'long', 'drives', 'strains', 'credibility.Okay', 'what', 'put', 'Tom', 'Hanks', 'bat', 'even', 'most', 'mediocre', 'Class', 'A', 'pitchers', 'would', 'be', 'obvious', 'home', 'run', 'king', 'fact', 'think', 'Penny', 'Marshall', 'did', 'great', 'job', 'creating', 'maintaining', 'illusion', 'Big', 'League', 'skills', 'players', 'so', 'were', 'not', 'distracted', 'story', 'Skillful', 'editing', 'way', 'gave', 'Academy', 'Awards', 'performance', 'role', 'short', 'supporting', 'role', 'longer', 'cameo', 'maybe', 'should', 'Megan', 'Cavanagh', 'would', 'have', 'won', 'touching', 'impersonation', 'Marla', 'Hooch', 'painfully', 'shy', 'vulnerable', 'less', 'pretty', 'girl', 'farm', 'who', 'baseball', 'player', 'city', 'guy', 'heart', 'unselfconscious', 'boozy', 'off-key', 'torch', 'song', 'also', 'loved', 'scene', 'where', 'rocketing', 'line', 'drives', 'walls', 'windows', 'high', 'school', 'gymnasium.Note', 'appearance', 'David', 'L.', 'Lander', 'radio', 'play-by-play', 'guy', 'best', 'known', 'wacky/creepy', 'quot', 'Squiggy', 'quot', 'Squiggman', 'old', 'Laverne', 'Shirley', 'TV', 'sit-com', 'Here', 'mostly', 'straight', 'get', 'wear', 'hat', 'bill', 'up', 'Leo', 'Gorcey', 'did', 'East', 'Side', 'Kids', 'AKA', 'Bowery', 'Boys', 'movies', 'early', 'forties.Bottom', 'line', 'here', 'Uplifting', 'fun', 'even', 'worth', 'seeing', 'again']",N/A

The Green Mile.  (I could go on, but you get my point; I could post links to all these films, but I'm too lazy, so my apologies.)  Add to this list the uplifting film A LEAGUE OF THEIR OWN, a movie based on the actual All-American Girls Professional Baseball League (AAGPBL).  Hanks plays crusty Jimmy Dugan, a liquored-up and washed-up player with a bad knee; Dugan is given a shot managing the upstart Rockford Peaches, a task he lacks considerable enthusiasm in performing, and the stage is set for a clash in the clubhouse, as women in the World War II era playing America's game in a misogynistic culture begs confrontation.  The tension is the motor that drives the story, as Dugan gets a baptism by fire into an estrogen-driven environment, when emotions are worn on short sleeves.  And it's extremely entertaining to watch (""There's no crying in baseball!"" is one of the best lines in all of cinema), as the Rockford Peaches and their manager close ranks as the season progresses--first to keep the franchise from folding; second to win the inaugural AAGPBL World Series.The cast is fantastic; along with Hanks, Geena Davis and Lori Petty are stellar as combative sisters Dottie and Kit.  Dottie is the best player on the team as the Peaches' catcher and team captain; Lori is a darn good pitcher yearning to be out of her big sister's shadow.  The supporting cast includes Jon Lovitz, the always good David Strathairn, a surprisingly good Madonna, and one annoying Rosie O'Donnell in her big screen debut.  (I kept waiting for Rosie to take a line drive in the kisser, but alas...)  Granted, the plot is predictable, including the botched tag that determines the World Series winner, yet the poignant and bittersweet reunion of the Peaches as the Baseball Hall of Fame opens its AAGPBL exhibit, is priceless.  So Hanks may have owned the Nineties, but A LEAGUE OF THEIR OWN will continue to enthrall viewers no matter the decade.--D.

The league, formed to fill the gap left by the canceling of the Major League season while the players were at war, was not the most popular idea at its inception. . . The story is good.  Have no doubt, this movie is not a ""guy"" picture, but it is a great ""date movie.""Gina Davis, Tom Hanks, and Lori Petty are all really amazing actors.  Madonna and Rosie O'Donnell make great supporting cast members.  Hey, it is a movie that Madonna didn't kill!  The story is special and rather touching.  There is good suspense in the movie.  Generally, I am remarkably anti-suspense as I find it rather annoying.  It is present in this film at times, but never long enough to become annoying. . .I have never been a huge baseball fan.

Why was it a hit, you might ask?  I myself think that it's because &quot;A League of their own&quot; attracks a wide audience range.  I saw this when I was little, but adults enjoy it as well.  It can be told as a sports story, but also includes love stories.  It also is good for World War II buff's because (most of) it takes place in the WWII era.  The story begins with Dotty Hensen (Geena Davis) who is then an older grandmother.  She is invited to a new Hall of Fame dedicated to the Women's Baseball League.  When coming into the field to meet her old teammates, she starts to remember everything that happened.  That's when the movie flashes back in time and the main story takes place.  Dotty is invited to play for a new league of Women's Baseball, since the men are at war.  She accepts, only if her kid sister Kit (Lori Petty) can come along.  Finally they both try out and get into the same team, Rockaford Peaches.  Jimmy Doogan (Tom Hanks) is the team's coach, and doesn't exactly like the concept of coaching girls baseball.  From then on, friendships grow among the players and historical instinces occur.  Overall, I'd reccomend &quot;A League of Their own&quot; to fans of movies in general.  The acting is great.  Madonna (Mae) and Rosie O'Donnell (Doris) also make this movie funny.  This is one of the best movies of the 90's, and no one's collection is complete without it.",5,Completely HALARIOUS!

Our 9-yr old daughter has enjoyed watching this with us at least twice, and I have no doubt that we'll watch it frequently enough to justify owning rather than renting.Where we've been somewhat burned by forgetting how old pre-PG-13 PG movies could be, this is not at all a question for us.  Madonna plays a character who is adventurous, but her quips (such as a tight dress whose disomfort won't be an issue because she's &quot;not planning on wearing it that long&quot;) pass too quickly for them to register.But in no stretch is this just a movie for the pre-teens.  The performance of Tom Hanks is absolutely terrific, and Geena Davis and Lori Petty make two very competitive sisters come to life.  Jon Lovitz is hilarious as a scout, and Rosie O'Donnell is great as Madonna's comic foil.  The writing is spot on in providing these actors turf to chew (who will ever forget &quot;there's no crying in baseball!&quot;?), and the story is very pleasant, and a little inspirational even.The only part I don't like (and others may disagree) is the modern sections at the beginning and the end which set the stage for reminiscing about the league.  To me (ok, I'm a guy, crush a beer can on my forehead) the time during those sections feels very slow, and the actors (different actors from the bulk of the movie) seem stiff.Thankfully, though, Hollywood has changed names while retaining some of the negative traits of the characters.  Tom Hanks' character is based on that of Jimmy Foxx, a tremendous hitter who hit over 500 home runs, but whose career was cut short by alcohol.  That aspect is here, and it's strong, although they have changed Foxx's name to Dugan.",4,Excellent family entertainment (with OLDER kids),1035849600,"10 29, 2002",2002,1831,"['.As', 'studios', 'release', 'more', 'more', 'back', 'catalog', 'material', 'dating', 'back', 'was', 'PG-13', 'rating', 'tough', 'find', 'suitable', 'movies', '13', '9-yr', 'old', 'daughter', 'enjoyed', 'watching', 'least', 'twice', 'have', 'doubt', ""'ll"", 'watch', 'frequently', 'enough', 'justify', 'owning', 'rather', 'renting.Where', ""'ve"", 'been', 'somewhat', 'burned', 'forgetting', 'how', 'old', 'pre-PG-13', 'PG', 'movies', 'could', 'be', 'not', 'question', 'Madonna', 'character', 'who', 'adventurous', 'quips', 'such', 'tight', 'dress', 'disomfort', 'wo', ""n't"", 'be', 'issue', 'quot', 'not', 'planning', 'wearing', 'long', 'quot', 'pass', 'too', 'quickly', 'register.But', 'stretch', 'just', 'movie', 'pre-teens', 'performance', 'Tom', 'Hanks', 'absolutely', 'terrific', 'Geena', 'Davis', 'Lori', 'Petty', 'make', 'two', 'very', 'competitive', 'sisters', 'come', 'life', 'Jon', 'Lovitz', 'hilarious', 'scout', 'Rosie', ""O'Donnell"", 'great', 'Madonna', 'comic', 'foil', 'writing', 'spot', 'providing', 'actors', 'turf', 'chew', 'who', 'will', 'ever', 'forget', 'quot', 'crying', 'baseball', 'quot', 'story', 'very', 'pleasant', 'little', 'inspirational', 'even.The', 'only', 'part', 'do', ""n't"", 'like', 'others', 'may', 'disagree', 'modern', 'sections', 'beginning', 'end', 'set', 'stage', 'reminiscing', 'league', 'ok', ""'m"", 'guy', 'crush', 'beer', 'can', 'forehead', 'time', 'sections', 'feels', 'very', 'slow', 'actors', 'different', 'actors', 'bulk', 'movie', 'seem', 'stiff.Thankfully', 'Hollywood', 'changed', 'names', 'retaining', 'negative', 'traits', 'characters', 'Tom', 'Hanks', 'character', 'based', 'Jimmy', 'Foxx', 'tremendous', 'hitter', 'who', 'hit', '500', 'home', 'runs', 'career', 'was', 'cut', 'short', 'alcohol', 'aspect', 'here', 'strong', 'have', 'changed', 'Foxx', 'name', 'Dugan']",N/A

I remember my mom and I were in Blockbuster Video store when I was nine, and she and I couldn't find anything.  Then, she saw &quot;A League of Their Own,&quot; she told me that I would love this movie.  And boy was she right.  I have seen this movie over 50 times, I know the entire dialogue, the songs, every moment, I can rehash line for line right now if I wanted to.  I think this movie had the most well-rounded cast in over a decade.  Geena Davis was amazing as Dottie Henson; a person who loved the game very much, although she tried to pull off that she didn't.  Lorri Petty's best role to date, as Kit Keller, Dottie's younger sister, whom is always stuck in Dottie's shadow.  The chemistry between Petty and Davis is amazing, they work so well together, they were extremely believable.  Tom Hanks was fantastic as the alcoholic, ex-baseball star Jimmy Dugan, which of course, his classic urinating seen is a total laugh.  Madonna and Rosie had made the laughs of the film, they were wise cracking and hilarious.I can go on and on about this film, and the problem is, I can't quite articulate how much I love this film, and why I love it so much.  I've cried many times, especially the scene with Betty &quot;Spighetti&quot; and at the end of the World Series.  I love this film, Penny Marshall is a Goddess.  She chose the perfect actors, and the perfect score, especially Madonna's &quot;Playground&quot; which still makes me cry at the ending sequences.  This movie observes a part of history that is ignored.

It's told from the perspective of Dottie (Geena Davis), a reluctant farmgirl whose husband is currently serving in the war. When the wisecracking baseball recruiter (played by Jon Lovitz, and he's brilliant!) shows up at her doorstep, Dottie originally says no, but her younger sister Kit (Lori Petty) coaxes her into going, and soon they're Rockford Peaches and playing ball.Now, admittedly I'm not a big Madonna, Tom Hanks, or Geena Davis or even baseball fan.  But it's obvious their hearts were in this film, because it's acted perfectly and I couldn't improve on it at all.  Tom Hanks plays the drunken manager of the Peaches, and he pulls it off so well you question his sobriety in real life!  This movie is very heartwarming, definitely a feel-good and tearjerker (for the girls).  Guys may find this a bit too 'chick-flick' for their tastes, but parents will like it as a movie that encourages girls to be all that they can. It's a longish film, so be prepared for a good sit.On to the DVD.  That's the *only* reason this movie lost that star for the rating.  First of all, the cover.  Madonna is on the cover, but those that are diehard Madonna fans will find that her part is not nearly as big in this movie as she's billed.  Rather, it follows Geena Davis's character (and thus her sister Kit), and it's Lori Petty who should have been on the cover instead of Madonna, simply in terms of who had the bigger role. Ah well.Also, there are ZERO DVD extras. Zero. Zilch.  To make up for this, it's one of the most reasonably priced DVDs I've seen out there, and the picture quality is really great.If you're looking for this movie to add to your DVD favorites, go ahead and buy it, but be aware that there's no extras.

Jimmy Dugan is based on the great player, Jimmy Foxx who had a Hall of Fame career with the Philadelphia Athletics and later the Boston Red Sox. With the Athletics, he was in three World Series, 1929-1931, winning in 1929 and 1930. Foxx did manage the women's baseball teams during World War Two. Dottie Hensen really existed, as did her sister. Penny Marshall and her writers did an excellent job staying close to the true story. Obviously, Marshall's influence is seen in the comic performances of Madonna and O'Donnell. It's a shame those two haven't made similar movies since then. Lovitz was at his peak and carries the early part of the picture until Hanks steps in.

At first, the league is ridiculed and made fun of, but some star players really bring in the crowds and show that indeed girls can play baseball. The Rockford Peaches, a team of consisting of a vixen, a former Miss Georgia, and two sisters that have a intense rivalry that consists of the younger sister being constantly in the bigger sister's shadow as the teams star catcher. With a deadbeat, washed out, former baseball player as their manager, The team forms a bond that isn't broken over the course of years. When they go to the playoffs, the sisters rivalry comes to a head as the sisters have to prove who is the better baseball player.Penny Marshall simply has made a marvelous film that combines emotion, drama, and comedy effectively. She can take a actor and make them have some fine acting done. She effectively makes the characters seem real and realistic. She doesn't make the characters seem fake and wooden. She adds dignity and emotion to the ball players and adds a sense where we see the ball players as women. She also can feeling strange and wonderful when the movie is over because you have experienced the women as both ballplayers and humans.Tom Hanks gives one of his most unique performances to date. He proves that he has the staying power and the guts to take a character and add his own characteristics to it. He is a marvolous character actor. Geena Davis was a solid actress. Her performance was probably one of the best of her career. She really has the acting chops. Madonna was very imperessive in her role, and she hasn't amazed me lately in her roles. But, she really pulled out a solid performance in this film.Penny Marshall really proved that she is one of Hollywood's best female directors. Like I said, She adds a certian diginity to her characters and makes them human. She has a soft side and it shows in her movies. The film is a solid look at a league that was ridculed and it rised above the chains and formed some solid all american players.

Tom Hanks co-stars as their lovable, perpetually drunk coach, and Jon Lovitz appears in a scene-stealing cameo.The film more or less follows the pattern of most sports films, setting up the conflict that will eventually pit sister against sister in the climactic championship game.It's testament to director Penny Marshall that the film mostly manages to rise above the clich&eacute;d storyline, at least until the awkward epilogue, which forces emotion instead of letting it unfold, and reduces its characters to caricatures.A League of Their Own isn't quite in a league of its own, but it's pretty close.",4,Just shy of a homerun,1011916800,"01 25, 2002",2002,1018,"['little', 'too', 'sentimental', 'own', 'good', 'League', 'Their', 'Own', 'up', 'just', 'shy', 'homerun.The', 'bittersweet', 'comedy', 'true', 'story', '1943', 'all-woman', 'baseball', 'league', 'put', 'together', 'satisfy', 'baseball', 'fans', 'male', 'players', 'went', 'war.Geena', 'Davis', 'Lori', 'Petty', 'Madonna', 'star', 'women', 'determined', 'prove', 'mettle', 'disprove', 'popular', 'belief', 'quot', 'quot', 'ca', ""n't"", 'play', 'game', 'Tom', 'Hanks', 'co-stars', 'lovable', 'perpetually', 'drunk', 'coach', 'Jon', 'Lovitz', 'scene-stealing', 'cameo.The', 'film', 'more', 'less', 'pattern', 'most', 'sports', 'films', 'setting', 'up', 'conflict', 'will', 'eventually', 'pit', 'sister', 'sister', 'climactic', 'championship', 'game.It', 'testament', 'director', 'Penny', 'Marshall', 'film', 'mostly', 'rise', 'clich', 'eacute', 'd', 'storyline', 'least', 'awkward', 'epilogue', 'emotion', 'instead', 'letting', 'unfold', 'characters', 'caricatures.A', 'League', 'Their', 'Own', ""n't"", 'quite', 'league', 'own', 'pretty', 'close']",N/A
8944,AGKPTMTR3UX1R,076780922X,"Konrei ""Everything I need is right here""","[0, 0]","With the institution of the peacetime draft in 1940, Major League Baseball went into a major league slump, since, as a repository of well-conditioned 1-A young males, it lost a significant percentage of its players to the demands of the war years. Some did not return.To counter the loss, owners resuscitated the careers of older players dragged from retirement, promoted the abilities of marginal utility players and minor leaguers ineligible for the draft, and engaged in publicity stunts to keep ahold of the public interest.One of the more original and more successful of these ""stunts"" was the creation of the All-American Girls Professional Baseball League, the AAGPBL, which remained in operation until 1954. AAGPBL players were supposed to ""draw them in"" by being young and pretty, and by playing ball in (for the era) shockingly short skirts. Meant to be strictly exploitative, the AAGPBL actually fielded some surprisingly talented teams.1992's A LEAGUE OF THEIR OWN is the fictionalized history of one of these teams, the Rockford Peaches. A great ensemble cast (including Geena Davis, Madonna and Rosie O'Donnell in her film debut) brings these scrappy ladies back to life in an affectionately humorous way. Tom Hanks plays Jimmy Dugan, (who in real life was former long ball hitter Jimmie Foxx), as a washed-up alcoholic wreck of a manager who redeems himself by making the team his own.Director Penny Marshall keeps it light overall, although some dark elements, such as the ever-present hovering war, manage to add some depth to the film. The cast, while comedic, also treats the subject with respect. These were real teammates who got ""dirt in the skirt"" while playing their hearts out in a succession of Minor League ballparks.The most memorable line of the film belongs to the hungover Dugan, who, in the wake of a bush-league error responds to the weeping of one of the women by shouting, ""There's no crying in baseball!"" Perhaps not. But it's hard not to be misty-eyed at the AAGPBL reunion and Hall of Fame induction ceremony at the end. This is a fun, warm, and unexpectedly meaningful movie that has stood the test of time.",5,"""There's no crying in baseball!""",1223769600,"10 12, 2008",2008,2146,"['institution', 'peacetime', 'draft', '1940', 'Major', 'League', 'Baseball', 'went', 'major', 'league', 'slump', 'repository', 'well-conditioned', '1-A', 'young', 'males', 'lost', 'significant', 'percentage', 'players', 'demands', 'war', 'years', 'did', 'not', 'return.To', 'counter', 'loss', 'owners', 'resuscitated', 'careers', 'older', 'players', 'dragged', 'retirement', 'promoted', 'abilities', 'marginal', 'utility', 'players', 'minor', 'leaguers', 'ineligible', 'draft', 'engaged', 'publicity', 'stunts', 'keep', 'ahold', 'public', 'interest.One', 'more', 'original', 'more', 'successful', 'stunts', 'was', 'creation', 'All-American', 'Girls', 'Professional', 'Baseball', 'League', 'AAGPBL', 'remained', 'operation', '1954', 'players', 'were', 'supposed', 'draw', 'being', 'young', 'pretty', 'playing', 'ball', 'era', 'shockingly', 'short', 'skirts', 'Meant', 'be', 'strictly', 'exploitative', 'AAGPBL', 'actually', 'fielded', 'surprisingly', 'talented', 'teams.1992', 'A', 'LEAGUE', 'OF', 'THEIR', 'OWN', 'fictionalized', 'history', 'one', 'teams', 'Rockford', 'Peaches', 'A', 'great', 'ensemble', 'cast', 'including', 'Geena', 'Davis', 'Madonna', 'Rosie', ""O'Donnell"", 'film', 'debut', 'scrappy', 'ladies', 'back', 'life', 'affectionately', 'humorous', 'way', 'Tom', 'Hanks', 'Jimmy', 'Dugan', 'who', 'real', 'life', 'was', 'former', 'long', 'ball', 'hitter', 'Jimmie', 'Foxx', 'washed-up', 'alcoholic', 'wreck', 'manager', 'who', 'making', 'team', 'own.Director', 'Penny', 'Marshall', 'light', 'overall', 'dark', 'elements', 'such', 'ever-present', 'hovering', 'war', 'manage', 'add', 'depth', 'film', 'cast', 'comedic', 'also', 'subject', 'respect', 'were', 'real', 'teammates', 'who', 'got', 'dirt', 'skirt', 'playing', 'hearts', 'out', 'succession', 'Minor', 'League', 'most', 'memorable', 'line', 'film', 'belongs', 'hungover', 'Dugan', 'who', 'wake', 'bush-league', 'error', 'weeping', 'one', 'women', 'shouting', 'crying', 'baseball', 'Perhaps', 'not', 'hard', 'not', 'be', 'misty-eyed', 'AAGPBL', 'reunion', 'Hall', 'Fame', 'induction', 'ceremony', 'end', 'fun', 'warm', 'unexpectedly', 'meaningful', 'movie', 'stood', 'test', 'time']",N/A

Her sensitive portrayal of Dottie Hinson highlights the many facets of Davis' talents as an actress. I loved watching a piece of  history (however dramatized) which took place during my early childhood.  Madonna and Rosie O'Donnell were surprisingly good as the  loudmouth-but-secretly-caring-and-feeling Mae and Doris. You'll fall in  love with Ann Cusack's &quot;Shirley Baker&quot;, and poor, homely but  super-star batter Marla Hooch is someone you just gotta root for. Tom Hanks  gives us his usual fine performance as the arrogant, boozy and cynical (but  in for some surprises) coach Jimmy Dugan. The chauvinistic/sexist way the  female players were treated (professional baseball in a cocktail waitress  costume!?) by management, the public and the press (&quot;...after all,  they're only girls.&quot;) will incense many viewers, but it's the way  things actually were then. For the movie to be made any other way would be  less than truth. The way that the real Dotties, Kits, Maes, Dorises and the  others dealt with those attitudes surely contributed to social change and  enlightenment about the abilities of the female half of our population. A  compliment, also, to the casting people; where did they find the older  look-alikes? Notably, Lynn Cartwright as &quot;Older Dottie&quot; and  Eugenia McLin as &quot;Older Ellen Sue&quot;.

This goes right next to that danged whale movie as a How in the World Are People Finding This an Empowering Story?I was led to believe it was about women playing baseball.No.It was about women who'd rather be doing something else playing baseball, about sibling rivalry, and a big public service announcement that looks are really important and that fat people are subhumans that deserve to be punished. The only character that undergoes any growth is (surprise!!!!) a guy, Tom Hanks as the alcoholic manager who overcomes it when he has Something to live for.Rosie O'Donnell, the one athlete in the bunch, is a one-note as the fat person we are allowed to make fun of. Madonna is the one-note that, well, ya gotta have a designated slut if you have a bunch of women together. The dialog really gave Madonna enough to work with that she could have brought more to the character, but she chose not to. I am baffled that O'Donnell cooperated in her own pillorying. And really, what's with calling her ugly, anyway? I'm a het woman and if I looked in the mirror only to see Rosie O'Donnell, that would be fine. Oh, I know what's wrong--she's not skinny. Got it.We are expected to be appalled at the fake newsreels where the women ball players are made to put on lipstick and powder their shiny noses, and we are not allowed to notice that this film displays the same silly, dehumanizing emphasis on looks over substance.In the bus scene, the little boy is made to terrorize the team members until he gets chocolate. He is, of course, a hefty kid--just in case we hadn't noticed yet that fat is bad, and that women are to blame, the mom gets the kid to stop his tantrum with a treat. If this movie addressed how women really behave in groups, there would be a scene or two with someone trying to find the little boy something to do during the stupifying bus ride.But you see, we can't have women with real emotions in movies.

There can be nothing nurturing or generous--unless it is of the passive, subservient kind, such as Geena Davis's character throwing the game.What a horrible film.",1,Beyond awful.,1326326400,"01 12, 2012",2012,2172,"['Really', 'am', 'stunned', 'right', 'next', 'danged', 'whale', 'movie', 'How', 'World', 'Are', 'People', 'Finding', 'Empowering', 'Story', 'was', 'led', 'believe', 'was', 'women', 'playing', 'baseball.No.It', 'was', 'women', 'who', ""'d"", 'rather', 'be', 'doing', 'something', 'else', 'playing', 'baseball', 'sibling', 'rivalry', 'big', 'public', 'service', 'announcement', 'are', 'really', 'important', 'fat', 'people', 'are', 'deserve', 'be', 'punished', 'only', 'character', 'growth', 'surprise', 'guy', 'Tom', 'Hanks', 'alcoholic', 'manager', 'who', 'when', 'Something', 'live', 'for.Rosie', ""O'Donnell"", 'one', 'athlete', 'bunch', 'one-note', 'fat', 'person', 'are', 'allowed', 'make', 'fun', 'Madonna', 'one-note', 'well', 'got', 'ta', 'have', 'designated', 'slut', 'have', 'bunch', 'women', 'together', 'dialog', 'really', 'gave', 'Madonna', 'enough', 'work', 'could', 'have', 'brought', 'more', 'character', 'chose', 'not', 'am', 'baffled', ""O'Donnell"", 'cooperated', 'own', 'pillorying', 'really', 'what', 'calling', 'ugly', 'anyway', ""'m"", 'het', 'woman', 'looked', 'mirror', 'only', 'see', 'Rosie', ""O'Donnell"", 'would', 'be', 'fine', 'Oh', 'know', 'what', 'wrong', 'not', 'skinny', 'Got', 'it.We', 'are', 'expected', 'be', 'appalled', 'fake', 'newsreels', 'where', 'women', 'ball', 'players', 'are', 'made', 'put', 'lipstick', 'powder', 'shiny', 'noses', 'are', 'not', 'allowed', 'notice', 'film', 'same', 'silly', 'dehumanizing', 'emphasis', 'bus', 'scene', 'little', 'boy', 'made', 'terrorize', 'team', 'members', 'chocolate', 'course', 'hefty', 'kid', 'just', 'case', 'had', ""n't"", 'noticed', 'yet', 'fat', 'bad', 'women', 'are', 'blame', 'mom', 'kid', 'stop', 'tantrum', 'treat', 'movie', 'addressed', 'how', 'women', 'really', 'behave', 'groups', 'would', 'be', 'scene', 'two', 'someone', 'trying', 'find', 'little', 'boy', 'something', 'do', 'stupifying', 'bus', 'ride.But', 'see', 'ca', ""n't"", 'have', 'women', 'real', 'emotions', 'movies', 'can', 'be', 'real', 'drive', 'only', 'competition', 'individuals', 'can', 'be', 'nothing', 'nurturing', 'generous', 'passive', 'subservient', 'kind', 'such', 'Geena', 'Davis', 'character', 'throwing', 'game.What', 'horrible', 'film']",N/A

(Hanks, too, I guess, although I seem to be one of the few people who think he's a bit overrated).As history and as a message movie -- it fails. For starters, in the first year of the AAGPBL, they played softball, not baseball.Some of the actors were convincing as ballplayers; others were not. In the latter category was Lori Petty. When she pitched, she would grunt and throw out her right leg to make it look as if she were really throwing a fireball in there. But if you watch the ball instead of her, it's clear that her ""fast ball"" is going about 20 mph.But my main complaint is in the ""message""; which, I guess, is that women can do anything men can do. Sure. But Penny Marshall undermined that concept with the fact that, in the movie, the league only became popular after a sexy shot of ""Dottie Hinson"" catching a foul while doing a split was published in Life magazine, and after the team members started rewarding men who caught foul balls with a kiss. So the true message seems to be: Men will watch womens' sports if the participants are good-looking, and if there are no mens' sporting events to watch. That pretty much sums up today's LPGA tour. So here's the key: Stop looking for a ""you go girls"" message. Enjoy a moderately charming and funny film. And you'll be okay.",3,"Yes, you go girls.

Davis allows Petty to blame her for all the things that have gone wrong in her life; the whiny little sister who is always in the shadow of her more accomplished bigger sister wore thin, particularly since Petty was so self-centered in it.  Then take Davis...she selfishly leaves the team at the World Series, then comes back in game 7 and expects to play, despite the fact that stand in Alice has played the first six games.  And then, in the film's climactic moment, she ""drops"" the ball, all to allow her whiny sister a chance to be ""the star"" of the moment.

Well, it's a shame I broke that rule several times while I watched this movie.  It's just really good at being inspiring and tugging at the heart strings at the same time.In World War II, when a majority of the athletes joined the service and went off to war, the baseball associations brought in women to fill their positions.  And at first everyone was skeptical, games weren't selling well and it looked as if the whole notion would be dead on its feet.  But then people started paying attention to just how good these girl's were.  And history changed.  This movie spends time on two sisters who join the league and their ups and downs with the game and each other.Characters:Tom Hanks: Jimmy DuganGeena Davis: Dottie HinsonLori Petty: Kit KellerAnne Ramsey: Helen HaleyMegan Cavanagh: Marla HoochRosie O'Donnell: Doris MurphyTracy Reiner: Betty HornMadonna: Mae MordabitoBitty Schram: Evelyn GardnerThe cast in this movie is fabulous.  All of them play their parts so well and you can believe all of them truly love baseball (and if they didn't before the movie they probably do now).  They had a lot of fun out there.  Hanks was a convincing alcoholic used to be pro ballplayer turned coach.  He has a lot of funny lines, although I'm not sure I enjoyed watching him pee for five minutes.  Davis as Dottie was perfect.  She had attitude and wasn't actually perfect.  She fought with her sister but still loved her, it was very much a real looking sibling relationship.  The same with Kit, she was the spoiled little sister who never quite feels good enough when compared to her older sibling.  Since that's a feeling a lot of younger siblings have it was very believable.  The only characters I couldn't quite get on board with were Rosie O'Donnels and Madonna's.  They did an ok job.  But I feel like they were there because they were famous and not because they were the best choices for the movie.Normally I'm not big into movies on sports.  Unless they're inspiring and about the underdog.  Which considering the time period and who was actually playing ball in this movie, they were the underdogs.  And I liked that they told some personal stories with the movie too, the sisters and the women with their husbands off at war.  It was very emotional and you may tear up several times during the movie.  There actually wasn't a ton about the sport itself, it was more about the people who played it.  But that just means it would be good for a wider audience.The sets on this film were very authentic.  Down to the cars and the clothes they fit into the movie just like you were transported back to the World War II era.  Even the music fit the period.  I'm glad they took the time to focus on the details and made sure that the movie was just right.A wonderful movie about a group of athletes that you don't think about too much.  But just like they won a spot in the Baseball Hall of Fame, this movie should also win a spot on your to-watch list.Review by M.

I think that the best baseball film ever made was ""Eight Men Out"" which tells the story of the 1919 Black Sox scandal.  Also high on my list of faves are ""The Natural"", ""Field of Dreams"", ""Bang The Drum Slowly"" and the 1992 comedy-drama ""A League of Their Own"".  In case you are not familiar with this film ""A League of Their Own"" stars Tom Hanks and Geena Davis and recalls the story of the All-American Girls Professional Baseball League which operated in several midwestern cities from 1943-1954.  I fell in love with this film the first time I saw it more than 15 years ago.The All-American Girls Professional Baseball League was a by-product of World War II.  For a time in the early 1940's it appeared the Major League Baseball might actually have to shut down because so many of its players were going overseas to fight.  A group of investors decided that a girls professional league might just be the ticket to temporarily fill the void being left by the men.  Although this is a fictionalized account of the AAGPBL you will come away from this film with a pretty good idea of what took place all those years ago. What began as an experiment actually lasted for more than a decade!  Tom Hanks stars as Rockford Peaches manager Jimmy Dugan, a retired all-star player whose career was cut short by the bottle.  The film also stars Geena Davis in the role of Dottie Hinson star catcher for the Peaches and Madonna as the rough and tumble center fielder ""All the Way"" Mae Mordabito.  But for me Lori Petty clearly steals the show as Dottie Hinson's insecure kid sister Kit who also plays for the Peaches.  Director Penny Marshall does a spendid job here and I found myself really beginning to care a great deal about all of these charactors during the course of this fine motion picture.If you are like me you will experience the full range of emotions watching ""A League of Their Own"".  You will laugh out loud,  cheer on the team and even shed a tear or two along the way.  Although the All-American Girl's Professional Baseball League is no more its legacy lives on at the National Baseball Hall of Fame in Cooperstown NY.  I have seen the exhibit and it is quite impressive indeed.  ""A League of Their Own"" is one of those rare films that can be seen and enjoyed by the entire family.  There really is something in this film for just about everyone.  I find that I enjoy this film more each time I see it.

I liked how Marshall made the movie from a retrospective view of Dottie Henson(Geena Davis).  It was nice to see the older ladies revitalized from playing baseball, and how it took them back to a happier time for themselves.The casting was first rate: Davis as Dottie Henson, Tom Hanks as Jimmy Dugan, Lori Petty as Kit, Madonna, Rosie O'Donnell, Megan Cavanagh, Bitty Schramm, David Straithairn(sp?), Garry Marshall, and Tracy Reiner.I enjoyed the sibling tension between Dottie and Kit.  It can be very difficult to be the younger sibling(Kit) when your older sibling(Dottie) is always outstanding, and tiresome, for the older sibling, when you are always blamed for existing by the younger sibling.  Marshall does a nice job of dealing with this situation and Davis and Petty are very real as fighting, but loving sisters.  They both want what is best for each other.You can see all of the women on the baseball team come alive as they realize that they can do anything that they set their mind to do.If you like anything directed by Penny Marshall, then you will be seeing her at her best.

""A League of Their Own"" is not a sad movie--far from it--but it has its nostalgic zings at the end, as well as a couple of heartbreaking moments. Yes, this is a movie about baseball, and it succeeds at that level--just read the other 300+ reviews. But it is also a movie about the struggles American women went through during WWII: the shortage of eligible men; husbands dead, dying or maimed overseas; the challenges of being taken seriously; manipulative employers and owners, etc. (And, once the war was over, things would not get better for many of these women, as they would be pushed out of the spotlight and into some suburban, kitchen-appliance-filled, anonymous Eisenhower-era home. Although this is not depicted, we know their fates.)The film is shot fairly conventionally, which I thought was appropriate. Penny Marshall allowed her very talented cast to take the ball and run with it, so to speak. (I know, baseball not football.) Hanks and Davis spar each other nicely. The Madonna/O'Donnell sideshow has a lot of appeal. For my money, though, Lori Petty gave a much-needed electrical charge to the screen. She is the most vulnerable, most frustrated character in the film.There are some nice extras here but some were throwaways. I liked the ""Nine Memorable Innings"" documentary--I, especially liked what Geena Davis had to say. Some of the edited scenes were good, other scenes deservedly wound up on the cutting room floor. I could have done without the Madonna video--not one of her best songs or videos. All in all, though, this ""A League of Their Own"" set is a great addition to any movie lover's (or baseball lover's) collection.",4,Maybe there's no crying in baseball but...,1373414400,"07 10, 2013",2013,1699,"['people', 'might', 'need', 'box', 'tissues', 'handy', 'A', 'League', 'Their', 'Own', 'not', 'sad', 'movie', 'far', 'nostalgic', 'zings', 'end', 'as', 'well', 'couple', 'heartbreaking', 'moments', 'Yes', 'movie', 'baseball', 'level', 'just', 'read', 'other', '300+', 'reviews', 'also', 'movie', 'struggles', 'American', 'women', 'went', 'WWII', 'shortage', 'eligible', 'men', 'husbands', 'dead', 'dying', 'maimed', 'overseas', 'challenges', 'being', 'taken', 'seriously', 'manipulative', 'employers', 'owners', 'etc', 'once', 'war', 'was', 'over', 'things', 'would', 'not', 'get', 'better', 'many', 'women', 'would', 'be', 'pushed', 'spotlight', 'suburban', 'kitchen-appliance-filled', 'anonymous', 'Eisenhower-era', 'home', 'not', 'depicted', 'know', 'fates', 'film', 'shot', 'fairly', 'conventionally', 'thought', 'was', 'appropriate', 'Penny', 'Marshall', 'allowed', 'very', 'talented', 'cast', 'take', 'ball', 'run', 'so', 'speak', 'know', 'baseball', 'not', 'football', 'Hanks', 'Davis', 'spar', 'other', 'nicely', ""Madonna/O'Donnell"", 'sideshow', 'lot', 'appeal', 'money', 'though', 'Lori', 'Petty', 'gave', 'much-needed', 'electrical', 'charge', 'screen', 'most', 'vulnerable', 'most', 'frustrated', 'character', 'film.There', 'are', 'nice', 'extras', 'here', 'were', 'throwaways', 'liked', 'Nine', 'Memorable', 'Innings', 'documentary', 'especially', 'liked', 'what', 'Geena', 'Davis', 'had', 'say', 'edited', 'scenes', 'were', 'good', 'other', 'scenes', 'deservedly', 'wound', 'up', 'cutting', 'room', 'floor', 'could', 'have', 'done', 'Madonna', 'video', 'not', 'one', 'best', 'songs', 'videos', 'though', 'A', 'League', 'Their', 'Own', 'set', 'great', 'addition', 'movie', 'lover', 'baseball', 'lover', 'collection']",N/A

Kit is very jealous of her sister, feels she can't measure up and blames Dottie for whenever she fails -- and baseball is not exception.As the girls begin to bond and go through their adventures the themes of male chauvinism is pretty strong.  So too are the themes of sisterhood and homage to a game that has traditionally shut out women:  ""Girls can't play baseball!""Madonna plays the sexy Mae: ""It's my name, and it's my attitude!""  Cute.Rosie O'Donnell running bases makes it hard to believe that she would later be a rather rotund talk show host!Tom Hanks as the has-been drunk coach of the team who at first thinks all he has to do is tip his hat, drink till he stinks and pee in the girls' bathroom.  He later snaps to and puts together quite the team.The film also made me more aware of American baseball history -- a chapter I was not aware of.

She batted and threw left-handed. A native of Cincinnati, Ohio, Kamenshek played outfield for a local softball league, and at the age of 17 she was spotted by a scout from the All-American Girls Professional Baseball League. After tryouts at Wrigley Field in Chicago, she joined the Rockford Peaches as an outfielder when the league began in 1943, but was soon playing first base. She and short stop Snooky Harrell formed the league's best double-play combination. Kamenshek played in the AAGPBL for 10 seasons, and was selected as an All-Star all seven times the league established such a team. In 1946 she was the league's top batter with an average of .316 (a single point ahead of Audrey Wagner), and won the distinction again in 1947 with an average of .306. She struck out only 81 times in 3,736 at-bat appearances. Considered one of the best athletes of her time, southpaw Kamenshek was even recruited for men's baseball by a team from Fort Lauderdale, Florida.

The rest of the way, the film is uneven, sometimes hitting the mark, but other times (like the framing scenes) missing.

Sisters that do love each other, except when it comes to baseball. Kit wants to play in the league but is upset to hear that it is Dottie who is chosen to play for the AAPGL. (All American Pro Girls League) Dottie refuses to play unless Kit can come along. AAPGL was only made because of the World War II and all of the man were in the war. Along the way to the stadium they meet Marla Hooch who is a great hitter, but to most people not the prettiest girl. When they are going to try out they meet Doris and Mae because Doris threw a baseball at Dottie who caught it impressing Doris. They girls find out their new manager is Jimmy Dugan. Jimmy Dugan drinks a lot and is the worst manager until Dottie get through to him and he becomes a better person. Miss Cuthbert makes sure the rules are followed, no boys, no drinking or smoking until Mae poisons her meal. The girls go to party and Marla who had been overlooked a lot is noticed by a guy named Nelson. Dottie's husband Bob is in the army and when news comes that a man in the army has been killed it turns out to be Betty Spaghetti. After awhile, Kit feels that once again like at home she is behind Dottie's shadow. Dottie notices it to and asks to be transferred to another team. Of course Mr. Lovitz doesn't want the best player to be transferred so he has Kit transferred to Racine. Kit feels that Dottie did this on purpose. Kit plays for the Racine while Dottie plays for Rockford. In the final scene Dottie is crashed into by Kit and she drops the ball, letting Racine win, making Kit have her own stardom instead of being in Dottie's shadow.
