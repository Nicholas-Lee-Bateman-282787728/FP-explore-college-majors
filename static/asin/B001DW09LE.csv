1183300,A2D4TI1Z69CAWV,B001DW09LE,Andrew Frueh,"[12, 13]","I often purchase movies and tv shows I remember from my childhood and end up disappointed at how terrible they are.With 1970s Saturday morning live action sci-fi, you wouldn't expect much...lots of (very bad) blue-screen effects and cheaply shot model space ships.  But, this set of DVDs was a genuine surprise.Almost everything about these shows satisfies.  There is better than average acting (if you can forgive Jonathan Harris' hamminess) though you wouldn't cast a lot of these people in Hamlet.  The models and sets aren't bad and the effects are pretty good (with the exception of Jason of Star Command's reliance on stop-motion Herryhausen stuff).Of course there is the ever-present morality lesson, and that can get annoying if you can't chalk it up to the campy appeal of the shows.As to the shows specifically:Ark II is especially interesting in that regard, since it deals with a post-environmental disaster Earth (and hey, who doesn't want a mobile labratory/RV?)  It's surprisingly well-acted.  The ""speaking"" chimp is requisite ""annoying little character."" (Orko, Snarf, etc).Space Academy deals with young adults learning the ropes at Star Command.  Unlike many shows of this genre, there isn't a baddie-of-the-week.  Several plots involve the consequences of the actions of the main characters themselves.  Loki is an orphaned alien child and while the acting is OK, there is an interesting amount of characterization in the fact that he doesn't know where he's from.  Peepbo, a small robot, is the show's highly annoying little character.Jason of Star Command is two seasons long - the first of which is in serial format with shorter episodes.  There are major cast changes between seasons.  This show is much more action/adventure oriented than either of the other two.  Peepbo is in this series as well (a shame), as is W1K1 (pronounced Wi-kee), a very small flying robot that resembles (and probably was) a wind-up toy.",4,"For once, the past lives up to the memory!",1248393600,"07 24, 2009",2009,1940,"['often', 'purchase', 'movies', 'tv', 'shows', 'remember', 'childhood', 'end', 'up', 'disappointed', 'how', 'terrible', 'are.With', '1970s', 'Saturday', 'morning', 'live', 'action', 'sci-fi', 'would', ""n't"", 'expect', 'much', 'lots', 'very', 'bad', 'blue-screen', 'effects', 'cheaply', 'shot', 'model', 'space', 'ships', 'set', 'DVDs', 'was', 'genuine', 'surprise.Almost', 'everything', 'shows', 'satisfies', 'better', 'average', 'acting', 'can', 'forgive', 'Jonathan', 'Harris', 'hamminess', 'would', ""n't"", 'cast', 'lot', 'people', 'Hamlet', 'models', 'sets', 'are', ""n't"", 'bad', 'effects', 'are', 'pretty', 'good', 'exception', 'Jason', 'Star', 'Command', 'reliance', 'stop-motion', 'Herryhausen', 'stuff', '.Of', 'course', 'ever-present', 'morality', 'lesson', 'can', 'get', 'annoying', 'ca', ""n't"", 'chalk', 'up', 'campy', 'appeal', 'shows.As', 'shows', 'specifically', 'Ark', 'II', 'especially', 'interesting', 'regard', 'post-environmental', 'disaster', 'Earth', 'hey', 'who', ""n't"", 'want', 'mobile', 'labratory/RV', 'surprisingly', 'well-acted', 'speaking', 'chimp', 'requisite', 'annoying', 'little', 'character', 'Orko', 'Snarf', 'etc', '.Space', 'Academy', 'deals', 'young', 'adults', 'learning', 'ropes', 'Star', 'Command', 'many', 'shows', 'genre', ""n't"", 'baddie-of-the-week', 'Several', 'plots', 'involve', 'consequences', 'actions', 'main', 'characters', 'Loki', 'orphaned', 'alien', 'child', 'acting', 'OK', 'interesting', 'amount', 'characterization', 'fact', ""n't"", 'know', 'where', 'Peepbo', 'small', 'robot', 'show', 'highly', 'annoying', 'little', 'character.Jason', 'Star', 'Command', 'two', 'seasons', 'long', 'first', 'serial', 'format', 'shorter', 'episodes', 'are', 'major', 'cast', 'changes', 'seasons', 'show', 'much', 'more', 'action/adventure', 'oriented', 'other', 'two', 'Peepbo', 'series', 'as', 'well', 'shame', 'W1K1', 'pronounced', 'Wi-kee', 'very', 'small', 'flying', 'robot', 'probably', 'was', 'wind-up', 'toy']",Filmation Sci-Fi Boxed Set: (Ark II / Space Academy / Jason of Star Command)

Given how long ago this was filmed, I didn't expect big movie effects, or expensive sets, or even great acting.  But, I did expect something that was at least watchable.  And, I did try to watch it.  I truly did.  But, good gravy!  After three episodes of each of these sets, I had to say ""enough""!  I gave them each a shot, but they were so awful!!!  A talking monkey?  Seriously?  Why?  And, the kid with the bushy eyebrows.  What was THAT all about?  It was just too much of a really bad thing, folks.  Waste your money if you wish.
