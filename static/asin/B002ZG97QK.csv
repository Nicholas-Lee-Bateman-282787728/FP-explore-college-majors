Most of the jokes in this film have a forced, and overly abrasive sense of humor, the sex references are just really lame and pointless. Another thing that didn't work was the very awkward chemistry between Drew Barrymore and Justin Long, they might have dated off-camera but the connection is just not there on-screen. Long's performance is pretty good but Barrymore who is always rather delightful in other films just looks uninspired and cranky in every scene. Going the Distance does have some tender and cute moments but this is just not a film that made me feel anything for these two characters struggling in a long-distance relationship.

The movie is reminiscent of Adam Sandler films to the vein ofBilly Madison (Widescreen Special Edition)with a little bit of typical Judd Apatow shenanigans thrown in.Justin Long and Drew Barrymore have this undeniable chemistry that carries the movie and makes the film enjoyable rather than over-the-top; because of this, the film is pleasant to watch rather than sappy.Sadly, this movie will have a hard time finding its audience. As a Labor Day Weekend release, it's not competing against much at the box office; however, the movie is too mature for teenagers (it's rated R) and too much of a downer for the twenty- and thirty-somethings. The movie would be awkward on date night - it's inappropriate for the first date and it has strong implications that might prove strange for anyone who is in a long-distance relationship.

If you go into the film knowing that, however, you will most likely enjoy the ride with the funny references and clever quips.Drew Barrymore plays typical Drew Barrymore, emphasizing her own funky side and cuteness.  Justin Long is our average Joe romantic hero and he does well in the role.  The supporting cast including Jason Sudekis, Christina Applegate and Jim Gaffigan, is wonderfully complimentary.Erin and Garret meet in a bar and have a one-night stand, much like many other twenty-somethings living in New York.  Knowing that Erin will be moving back to the west coast in six weeks, they decide to casually see one another until then and enjoy the summer getting to know one another.  Surprise surprise, their casual dating blossoms into something more and when the time to separate arrives, emotions make the moment more bitter than sweet.  Erin and Garret decide to give the long-distance relationship a go.We the audience get to watch as they try to keep the flame burning over the phone and Skype, with short visits once in a blue moon.  More than even their interactions with one another, I think the highlights include when each of the leads shares scenes with the supporting players.  Christina Applegate shines as Erin's overbearing sister.  Jason Sudekis is charming as Garret's best friend and voice of dubious reason.I dragged my boyfriend to see this and he ended up enjoying the exchanges.  It's raunchy and funny and fun.

It plays on the miscommunication between guys and girls. Then his girlfriend dumps him, and Justin goes to a bar and somehow wins over Drew Barrymore by harrassing her while she is playing an arcade game, causing her to lose. So they go back to his place, and even though Justin's creepy roomate is listening through paper thin walls and playing music from old movie scores, Drew and Justin have sex. Now, since I am the very last non-religious person alive with morals, I am not a fan of premarital relations because it is not fair to the children that they concieve (but I will keep that to myself).

1303486,A18G7GG53G2X8A,B002ZG97QK,Chris Pandolfi,"[2, 3]","In character-driven movies, there are always moments at which conversations naturally come to a stop. This is due not only to the screenwriter's dialogue, but also the director's sense of pacing and the timing of the actors. Well-trained audiences can pick up on this; they can instinctively feel when a scene, specifically when a passage of dialogue, should end. For the characters to continue speaking after that natural moment has passed will do little more than turn a scene into an awkward moment. Of all recently released movies, ""Going the Distance"" is the only one I can think of that has more awkward moments than pleasant ones. There are so many instances in which characters keep on talking, even though they have already passed that natural ending point in the conversation. I must have said, ""Please shut up,"" more times watching this film than I have in the past year.Most of the run-on dialogue is incredibly vulgar, which would have been fine had it worked in service of the story. Watching ""Going the Distance,"" one doesn't get the sense that it could only be told as a foul-mouthed, sexually charged joke fest; the whole thing felt like an exercise in how to make a romantic comedy R-rated. Do we really need a scene in which three guys graphically discuss masturbation in public, and then one of the guys continues the discussion with an old lady he's helping cross the street? How about a scene of the same guy asking for a beer as he sits on the toilet, doing his business? With the bathroom door open? This adds nothing to the film. It's vulgarity for vulgarity's sake. Reliable romantic comedies tend towards a PG-13 rating, and I saw no reason why this film had to be any different.The setup is as follows. Garrett (Justin Long) lives in New York City and is a talent scout for a small record label. Erin (Drew Barrymore) is a journalism student from San Francisco, and she's spending the summer in New York as an intern for a struggling newspaper. The two meet in a bar, and they immediately hit it off. Erin returns to San Francisco six weeks later, but not before she and Garrett decide to try a long-distance relationship, which will include texting, phone calls, and the occasional visit. Naturally, it proves more difficult than they imagined it would be. As they try to manage the ups and downs of a cross-country affair, Erin gets by as a waitress and lives with her sister, Corrine (Christina Applegate), and her husband, Phil (Jim Gaffigan). She also hopes against hope that there will be a reporting position for her in New York come the new year. This is doubtful, given current economic conditions and the dying status of print.One of the underlying issues of this film is that Drew Barrymore and Justin Long have absolutely no chemistry. Their performances are decent enough, considering, but never once did I believe them as a loving couple. That being said, I honestly don't know if recasting one or both of them would have made a difference; the material is so flat, coarse, and predictable that it's unlikely any actor or actors could have saved it, regardless of chemistry.Which brings me back to those insufferable awkward moments. Many are exacerbated by Garrett's best friends, Box (Jason Sudeikis) and Dan (Charlie Day), the latter doubling as Garrett's obnoxious roommate. Watching the three of them together, one idly wonders how they could stand being in the same room together, let alone be friends; Box and Dan are crude, annoying caricatures that no one in their right mind would bother getting to know. They have this maddening tendency to veer off into topics of conversation that primarily exist in low-grade teen comedies. It isn't until their final scene that I could actually see Dan, and only Dan, as something more than comedy relief; in that scene, he says something to Garrett, something both true and refreshing. Why couldn't he have been like that for the rest of the film?Some of the awkward moments are reserved for Corrine, written as a typecast of the caring sister, the exhausted mother, and the sexually frustrated wife all rolled into one. There's a scene late in the film in her backyard, when she has a few words with Garrett as she barbecues hamburger patties; what begins as a serious and touching declaration ends as a sophomoric verbal gag, effectively ruining the moment. This is what I mean by the natural conclusion of movie conversations. If a character has said everything that needed to be said, and if it has said well, why prolong the moment with a dirty joke that's both unnecessary and unfunny? I suspect that somewhere within ""Going the Distance"" is a pleasant, more refined romantic comedy, a film that doesn't need long-winded passages of dialogue that aim for the lowest common denominator.",3,"Shut Up!

I'm extremely hard on this genre, due mainly to its overabundance of use, and lack of reality. It's all too often the same formulistic trash over and over. At last - a rom-com that `goes the distance' to meet my expectations, only to continue on and exceed them, is found in Going the Distance.There's something for everyone here. Odds are you can relate to at least one, if not several, of the joyous adventures of dating and relationships that the picture displays so beautifully. I was continuously bombarded with smiles on my face, brought forth by memories of my personal past that the movie dug up for me.Going the Distance is rated R and it's filled with vulgarity and potty mouthed adults. But not once, does it play out unnatural. These characters are young, and their behavior reflects that. We buy that this his how they would act and speak and, like the bad words or not - it's still more pleasant to spend over 90 minutes with real people who swear, than fake ones with forced and phony PG - 13 dialogue.The film starts off in the very sexy city of New York and centers on the relationship of Garret (Justin Long) and Erin (Drew Barrymore). Garret runs into Erin during a night out with the guys. I won't spoil their meet-cute for you, but it was fun and original and offers up the first mouthful of bad language, and they hit it off right away; so much in fact, that they find themselves sitting on his bed later that night. See how adult and realistic? They sleep together, and discover they have amazing chemistry; as do Long and Barrymore. They spend the next six weeks schmoozing all over each other, having us in stitches along the way.And then just when everything seems to be going so well - Erin has to leave town to move back to San Francisco to finish school. Having a solid career in the music industry there in New York, neither of them even think to suggest that Garret go with her.We get our would-be sappy airport scene at the end of act one versus the end of the flick, and we appreciate that. It's not over the top either, and it feels right. They don't even show Long's character chasing her through the entire airport, just catching her as she's about to board the plane. No - he finds her at the ticket counter, checking in - located a mere 20 yards from where they said their goodbye. Nice, to the point, and plausible.They share a moment and agree to try the long distance thing. Now we snuggle into our seats a little more, knowing we're about to have a blast - if we've ever dabbled in the difficulty of such a ridiculous fiasco as a long distance relationship.Erin moves in with her sister Corrine (Christina Applegate) and Garret makes every effort to come see her as much as possible. One of the prized scenes in the film is formed from an immediate sex session needing to be met first thing, when Garret and Erin walk in the door of Corrine's house. Others include hot phone sex gone cold, miscommunication over the phone, and bad advice from moronic friends.This movie just worked for me, and I can't wait to see it again. I've been a huge Justin Long fan since forever - like Galaxy Quest forever. The kid is amazing and it's great to see him taking on adult roles like this one, where he's no longer the skinny dweeb who can't get the girl. Barrymore, I'm not real big on, but I adored her in this.And let's not forget the side characters. Garret's two best friends are a riot and both could easily carry a film of their own in the near future. Jason Sudeikis and Charlie Day, ladies and gentleman; take a note of their names. Christina Applegate is brilliant as always, and makes you long for the day she's granted a much overdo lead role as well. Her face when she catches her sister being `had' in her dining room, was priceless; as was it in the scene following.The look of this flick was sensational. Somewhere in-between the work of Woody Allen and Judd Apatow. I love the New York setting in movies, and this one is gushing with it. Match-cut it with California and can you go wrong? First time feature film director Nanette Burstein has formed a perfect movie, and surely she'll deliver us with more of the same, in the years to come.",5,Going the Distance Review,1285200000,"09 23, 2010",2010,4593,"['GOING', 'DISTANCESTARRING', 'Justin', 'Long', 'Drew', 'Barrymore', 'Christina', 'Applegate', 'Charlie', 'Day', 'Jason', 'Sudeikis', 'Ron', 'Livingston', 'Jim', 'Gaffigan', 'Rob', 'Riggle', 'Matt', 'Servitto', 'Kelli', 'GarnerWRITTEN', 'BY', 'Geoff', 'LaTulippeDIRECTED', 'BY', 'Nanette', 'BursteinRated', 'RGenre', 'Romantic', 'ComedyRelease', 'Date', '03', 'September', '2010Review', 'Date', '13', 'September', '2010I', 'have', ""n't"", 'enjoyed', 'romantic', 'comedy', 'much', 'Made', 'Honor', 'back', '2008', ""'m"", 'extremely', 'hard', 'genre', 'due', 'mainly', 'overabundance', 'use', 'lack', 'reality', 'too', 'often', 'same', 'formulistic', 'trash', 'over', 'last', 'rom-com', 'distance', 'meet', 'expectations', 'only', 'continue', 'exceed', 'found', 'Going', 'Distance.There', 'something', 'everyone', 'here', 'Odds', 'are', 'can', 'relate', 'least', 'one', 'not', 'several', 'joyous', 'adventures', 'dating', 'relationships', 'picture', 'so', 'beautifully', 'was', 'continuously', 'bombarded', 'smiles', 'face', 'brought', 'forth', 'memories', 'personal', 'past', 'movie', 'up', 'me.Going', 'Distance', 'rated', 'R', 'filled', 'vulgarity', 'potty', 'mouthed', 'adults', 'not', 'once', 'play', 'out', 'unnatural', 'characters', 'are', 'young', 'behavior', 'buy', 'how', 'would', 'act', 'speak', 'bad', 'words', 'not', 'still', 'more', 'pleasant', 'spend', '90', 'minutes', 'real', 'people', 'who', 'swear', 'fake', 'ones', 'forced', 'phony', 'PG', '13', 'dialogue.The', 'film', 'very', 'sexy', 'city', 'New', 'York', 'centers', 'relationship', 'Garret', 'Justin', 'Long', 'Erin', 'Drew', 'Barrymore', 'Garret', 'Erin', 'night', 'out', 'guys', 'wo', ""n't"", 'spoil', 'meet-cute', 'was', 'fun', 'original', 'up', 'first', 'mouthful', 'bad', 'language', 'hit', 'off', 'right', 'away', 'so', 'much', 'fact', 'find', 'sitting', 'bed', 'later', 'night', 'See', 'how', 'adult', 'realistic', 'sleep', 'together', 'discover', 'have', 'amazing', 'chemistry', 'do', 'Long', 'Barrymore', 'spend', 'next', 'six', 'weeks', 'schmoozing', 'other', 'having', 'stitches', 'way.And', 'then', 'just', 'when', 'everything', 'be', 'going', 'so', 'well', 'Erin', 'leave', 'town', 'move', 'back', 'San', 'Francisco', 'finish', 'school', 'Having', 'solid', 'career', 'music', 'industry', 'there', 'New', 'York', 'even', 'think', 'suggest', 'Garret', 'go', 'her.We', 'get', 'would-be', 'sappy', 'airport', 'scene', 'end', 'act', 'one', 'versus', 'end', 'flick', 'appreciate', 'not', 'top', 'either', 'right', 'do', ""n't"", 'even', 'show', 'Long', 'character', 'chasing', 'entire', 'airport', 'just', 'catching', 'board', 'plane', 'ticket', 'counter', 'checking', 'located', 'mere', '20', 'yards', 'where', 'said', 'goodbye', 'Nice', 'point', 'plausible.They', 'share', 'moment', 'agree', 'try', 'long', 'distance', 'thing', 'Now', 'snuggle', 'seats', 'little', 'more', 'knowing', ""'re"", 'have', 'blast', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'dabbled', 'difficulty', 'such', 'ridiculous', 'fiasco', 'long', 'distance', 'relationship.Erin', 'moves', 'sister', 'Corrine', 'Christina', 'Applegate', 'Garret', 'effort', 'come', 'see', 'as', 'much', 'possible', 'One', 'prized', 'scenes', 'film', 'formed', 'immediate', 'sex', 'session', 'needing', 'be', 'met', 'first', 'thing', 'when', 'Garret', 'Erin', 'walk', 'door', 'Corrine', 'house', 'Others', 'include', 'hot', 'phone', 'sex', 'gone', 'cold', 'miscommunication', 'phone', 'bad', 'advice', 'moronic', 'friends.This', 'movie', 'just', 'worked', 'ca', ""n't"", 'wait', 'see', 'again', ""'ve"", 'been', 'huge', 'Justin', 'Long', 'fan', 'forever', 'Galaxy', 'Quest', 'forever', 'kid', 'amazing', 'great', 'see', 'taking', 'adult', 'roles', 'one', 'where', 'no', 'longer', 'skinny', 'dweeb', 'who', 'ca', ""n't"", 'get', 'girl', 'Barrymore', ""'m"", 'not', 'real', 'big', 'adored', 'this.And', 'let', 'not', 'forget', 'side', 'characters', 'Garret', 'two', 'best', 'friends', 'are', 'riot', 'could', 'easily', 'carry', 'film', 'own', 'near', 'future', 'Jason', 'Sudeikis', 'Charlie', 'Day', 'ladies', 'gentleman', 'take', 'note', 'names', 'Christina', 'Applegate', 'brilliant', 'always', 'long', 'day', 'granted', 'much', 'overdo', 'lead', 'role', 'as', 'well', 'face', 'when', 'sister', 'being', 'had', 'dining', 'room', 'was', 'priceless', 'was', 'scene', 'following.The', 'look', 'flick', 'was', 'sensational', 'Somewhere', 'in-between', 'work', 'Woody', 'Allen', 'Judd', 'Apatow', 'love', 'New', 'York', 'setting', 'movies', 'one', 'gushing', 'Match-cut', 'California', 'can', 'go', 'wrong', 'First', 'time', 'feature', 'film', 'director', 'Nanette', 'Burstein', 'formed', 'perfect', 'movie', 'surely', ""'ll"", 'deliver', 'more', 'same', 'years', 'come']",N/A

On the down side, it's a little flat in places, and the biggest problem I had is that the supporting cast outshines the two leads in almost every scene. A comedy is only as good as it's stars, and Long and Barrymore were forgettable whenever they were joined on screen by such talented comedians such as Jason Sudeikis, Charlie Day, Christina Applegate, and Jim Gaffigan.

Thousands of couples function daily many miles apart, thank you very much, without all the fuss and whining and crying we witness in GOING THE DISTANCE, a rom-com that does, admittedly, have its share of funny moments (thank you Charlie Day and Jason Sudeikis), but can't overcome being irritably annoying.  I can see it now:  Oh, that's easy for you to say, some disgruntled reader will grumble; actually, it is easy for me to say.  My last two relationships have been long distance--the second one culminating in wedded bliss.  In fact, I first saw GOING THE DISTANCE as an in-flight movie as I was flying to spend time with. . .my wife.But enough about moi.Drew Barrymore and Justin Long blend well and have good chemistry as opposite coast lovebirds Erin and Garrett.  And again, there are some truly funny moments, primarily at the hands of Day and Sudeikis; but I still don't understand why Christina Applegate feels the need to be supremely unlikable as Barrymore's over-protective sister.  The plot moves predictably, we all know what's going to happen, and then a butterfly and kittens ending.  Yet throughout Erin and Garrett's collective tizzy that they can't spend every second of every day together--and how difficult being apart is, sniff, sniff--I felt an overwhelming urge to shout, ""Grow up!"" at my flat screen.

What distances itself from other traditional romcoms is that this movie doesn't resort to all the usual clich&eacute;s.  That is, they don't have a big fight, break up and get back together again.  There are conflicts of course, but they are real life issues that many of us may have faced over the years.  How do you continue a long distance relationship?  Do you chuck a lifelong dream job for romance?  Do you relocate for love?  All these questions are dealt with in a grown up way.  As is the tradition, there are sidekicks on each side.  For Erin there is her overly protective married sister.  For Garrett there is a quirky roommate (of course) and another drinking buddy.

He heads out to a bar with his two best friends Box (Jason Sudiekis who has a Burt Reynolds mustache that he refers to as a time machine) and Dan (Charlie Day) tell him what a lousy boyfriend he is.

1303516,A2R1HAXRNU0QX7,B002ZG97QK,RMurray847,"[10, 14]","It seems like it has been awhile since Justin Long actually looked interested in acting.  In several recent movies (notably HE'S JUST NOT THAT IN TO YOU), he has seemed bored and a little sickly.  His trademark witty attitude has been strictly by-the-book.  But finally, with GOING THE DISTANCE, he seems engaged again.  Perhaps it's because he's been given a true leading role, or perhaps it's working with the always perky and energetic Drew Barrymore (who actually seems subdued here).Long's character is a bit of a womanizer.  He drifts from one monogamous relationship to another, blithely clueless at what a lousy boyfriend he is (even though best friends Jason Sudeikis and Charlie Day constantly tell him EXACTLY why he is a lousy boyfriend).  But one evening, literally hours after his latest breakup, he meets Barrymore over a game of Centipede, and sparks fly.  They embark on a relationship, and Barrymore tells Long right from the start that she's moving back to San Francisco (from New York) in six weeks to finish her schooling.  She's been interning at an NYC paper, but there are no jobs.  So they agree to just enjoy themselves for the time they have together...but things get more serious, and when the time to depart comes, they cling to each other and promise to try to make their long distance relationship work.What follows are montages of text, phoning & Skyping misadventures, sticker shock over coast-to-coast airline costs (nicely realistic) and the occasional visit.  Long travels to California to visit Barrymore, who is living with her sister (uptight Christina Applegate) and brother-in-law (nicely played by Jim Gaffigan).What I liked about the film was that you could feel the strain on the relationship.  The weariness of remaining committed to a person you never see (and really don't even know all that well).  The lonely drinking.  The inconveniences of a 3 hour time zone difference.  Barrymore and Long feel like young adults (early 30s) instead of teenagers resisting the transition to adulthood.  The movie has a grown-up gloss to it.  It is also R-rated, instead of the usual PG-13 reserved for a film like this...and this gives it the freedom to let the script tread some decidedly raunchy territory (although to mixed results).But for everything fresh in the movie, something else feels tired.  Sudeikis and Day (as co-worker and roommate to Long, respectively) bring little new to the stale ""best friends"" characters.  It's always two guys who never have girlfriends of their own because they have cruder, baser ideals than our ""hero.""  I guess these characters exist to spout outrageous sexual lines and to generally make the lead male look less awful by comparison.  In GOING THE DISTANCE, we get to hear the real, ridiculous reason Sudeikis has grown a bushy mustache and we get to enjoy discovering that Day likes to leave the door wide open when he uses the restroom.  Terrific.Barrymore doesn't seem to have close friends, so she shares with her older, disapproving and protective sister.  Applegate is a good actress, so the two ladies are convincing together, but the dialogue doesn't cover any new ground.And I'm going to devote a paragraph just to chew the filmmakers out for casting Rob Riggle.  I've written about this supremely unfunny ""actor"" before.  He gets only one scene in this film, but he's as dreadful as ever.  Just remember his turn as a cop in THE HANGOVER...his ability to bring that tight, raunchy, hilarious movie to a screeching halt with his tazering of Zach Galifinaikis is a testament to his dubious skills...if anyone can mismatch his tone to that of the movie around him, it's Rob Riggle.GOING THE DISTANCE just mostly coasts along.  It's not actively horrible, has some nice moments and Barrymore and Long do generate some real chemistry.  Sometimes it feels fresh, and at others, terribly predictable.

The film, directed by Nanette Burstein (""American Teen""), has also some original ideas and a brief but decent support from Christina Applegate as the heroine's protective sister, but the end result is underwhelming, and sometimes even irritating.""Going the Distance"" begins with an intriguing premise. While working for a New York newspaper, Erin, (Drew Barrymore) a 31-year-old Stanford grad student, meets a recently jilted guy Garrett (Justin Long) at a bar. They sleep together that night, believing that their relationship will not be a serious one. As it turns out, they are mistaken. Six weeks pass, and Erin has to go back to San Francisco after her intern job is over. Erin and Garrett strive to maintain their love across the country.Despite its promising start with an interesting concept of lovers separated by a long distance, ""Going the Distance"" fails to make the most of its unique (and immediate to some) setting because of its flat narrative and uneven tone. Garrett's friends Dan and Box are little more than an excuse for vulgar and unfunny jokes that do not belong here.""Going the Distance"" starts out trying to be something more than just a typical romantic comedy, but loses steam pretty quickly after the nice airport scene before its disappointingly unoriginal wrap-up.

There's issues of exclusivity, sex starvation, questions of commitments, jobs, resentments, cost issues, holidays spent apart and back and forth teeter tottering. Sometimes I even think I have a relationship with my phone!Story Spoilers Alert:Barrymore's character, a struggling journalist spends time in New York for a newspaper internship and meets Long's character at a bar (this is perhaps the biggest stretch of the entire movie as they immediately click enough to ""seal the deal""). Barrymore and Long spend the next few months in the lovey-dovey honeymoon period of their romance and realize they don't want to end things. She flies back to San Fran and he stays in the Big Apple and thus, the plot of the movie: how do you make a relationship work with short-term visits and long-term time apart?The movie was well-developed, engaging and funny. There weren't times that the story seemed forced or exaggerated. These characters (also real-life on/off again paramours) seemed to genuinely love one another enough to fight for the success of their couple-hood.

""Going the Distance"" has that same sense of good hard play that Barrymore brought toWhip It- hardly a delicate little blossom pining for Prince Charming. This is about a relationship between grownups, so there a fair bit of grownup humor here, too, like that bumbling attempt at phonesex. In fact, I haven't laughed that hard at a movie in a very long time. (At least one reviewer called this 'raunchy,' but I respectfully disagree.
