106448,AE8RQHFMSLN0D,0790738074,"Anthony Damato ""Law professor""","[1, 4]","The previous customer reviews are going a little bit overboard on &quot;The Music Man.&quot;  Although it is one of Hollywood's musical comedy gems, it lacks a sense of good directorial pacing. Things are  overexplained, and the plot lumbers on; you don't mind this in the theatre,  but in a movie it's tiring. Songs that are fun to watch on stage get  tedious after a while on film. Still, what a pleasure to see Robert Preston  at the top of his form!  The producers of this film had the good sense to  keep the Broadway star, unlike the HUGE mistakes made by the film  &quot;Kismet&quot; in not using Alfred Drake and &quot;My Fair Lady&quot;  in not using Julie Andrews.  My vote for the best song in the show is  &quot;Lida Rose,&quot; sung by the barbershop quartet.  &quot;Till There  Was You&quot; is sublime.  And the opening salesman sequence on the train  is a unique moment in Hollywood films.  While &quot;The Music Man&quot;  is high on my list of the second-best group of Hollywood musicals, it  doesn't get into the first tier for a simple reason: no great dancing.

The image is crisp, colors are deep and beautiful, and the soundtrack is full and rich. If you're a fan of this musical, you owe it to yourself to get this version.For anyone who doesn't know, ""The Music Man"" was a Broadway show adapted to film. Robert Preston, who stared in the title role on stage, was included in the film at the insistence of the show's creator, Meredith Wilson. If I remember correctly, he wouldn't let the film go forward without the assurance that Robert Preston appear. There was a good reason for that, as the role of Harold Hill was Preston's signature role on stage or film. His charming and likable flimflam artist is one of the truly unforgettable performances in film history.Shirley Jones was a veteran performer in musicals by the time this film was made, having started out her career with Oklahoma and Carousel. Her pure voice is simply one of the best in the business, and her acting is always top notch as well.Ron Howard, at eight years old an experienced veteran of film and TV, had already appeared in the role of Opie on ""The Andy Griffith Show"" for two years by the time he made ""The Music Man"" and displays real emotion in his role of the troubled young boy sensitive about his lisp.The movie is charming, the music is fantastic, and the comedy will keep you laughing from start to finish.Highly recommended, especially in this blu ray presentation.",5,Best version of this movie yet,1376092800,"08 10, 2013",2013,1524,"[""'ve"", 'owned', 'Music', 'Man', 'VHS', 'DVD', 'can', 'tell', 'blu', 'ray', 'previous', 'release', 'water', 'image', 'crisp', 'colors', 'are', 'deep', 'beautiful', 'soundtrack', 'full', 'rich', ""'re"", 'fan', 'musical', 'owe', 'yourself', 'get', 'version.For', 'anyone', 'who', ""n't"", 'know', 'Music', 'Man', 'was', 'Broadway', 'show', 'adapted', 'film', 'Robert', 'Preston', 'who', 'stared', 'title', 'role', 'stage', 'was', 'included', 'film', 'insistence', 'show', 'creator', 'Meredith', 'Wilson', 'remember', 'correctly', 'would', ""n't"", 'let', 'film', 'go', 'forward', 'assurance', 'Robert', 'Preston', 'appear', 'was', 'good', 'reason', 'role', 'Harold', 'Hill', 'was', 'Preston', 'signature', 'role', 'stage', 'film', 'charming', 'likable', 'flimflam', 'artist', 'one', 'truly', 'unforgettable', 'performances', 'film', 'history.Shirley', 'Jones', 'was', 'veteran', 'performer', 'musicals', 'time', 'film', 'was', 'made', 'having', 'started', 'out', 'career', 'Oklahoma', 'Carousel', 'pure', 'voice', 'simply', 'one', 'best', 'business', 'acting', 'always', 'top', 'notch', 'well.Ron', 'Howard', 'eight', 'years', 'old', 'experienced', 'veteran', 'film', 'TV', 'had', 'already', 'appeared', 'role', 'Opie', 'Andy', 'Griffith', 'Show', 'two', 'years', 'time', 'made', 'Music', 'Man', 'displays', 'real', 'emotion', 'role', 'troubled', 'young', 'boy', 'sensitive', 'lisp.The', 'movie', 'charming', 'music', 'fantastic', 'comedy', 'will', 'keep', 'laughing', 'start', 'finish.Highly', 'recommended', 'especially', 'blu', 'ray', 'presentation']",N/A

Erland,"[11, 20]","Well, sorry to throw a monkey wrench into the praise party for the '62 film `The Music Man' but I have to be honest and say this is definitely not one of my favorite musicals. Yes there are moments of brilliance here; Robert Preston is magnificent as Professor Harold Hill and Shirley Jones is indeed lovely and sings beautifully, but I have decided to face the wrath of its legion of adoring fans and relate some of the reasons why this film bothers me.The single most important aspect of a musical is the music itself and in my estimation it is here that the production fails. With the exception of the beautiful `Til There Was You' and the clever `Marian the Librarian' I don't find any of the other numbers either noteworthy or memorable. In fact I find a number of them to be quite annoying such as the opening number `The Traveling Salesman', `Piano Lessons' and `Shipoopi'. Worst of all, if I have to hear that inane and repetitious `Gary, Indiana' song one more time I think I'll scream.On the other hand, maybe I just prefer musicals that are a little more melancholy and reflective rather than lighthearted and whimsical, something with less brass and more strings? Anyway I've said it. I may be the lone contrary but it's my opinion nevertheless.

106465,A3JM2U8EONZZL7,0790738074,Brian Jay Jones,"[231, 239]","Looking for the musical that beat WEST SIDE STORY for the Tony Award?  You've found it here, in Meredith Willson's THE MUSIC MAN -- and its appearance on DVD, in widescreen format and with all the bells and  whistles, is long overdue.Pop the disc in, and you'll immediately be  taken to the &quot;Right Here In River City&quot; documentary (you'll have  to press the MENU button on your DVD controls to get to the main menu so  you can actually view the movie -- why the disc goes immediately to the  documentary is rather odd). Hosted by Shirley Jones, who still looks great,  the top-notch, too-short documentary is crammed with lots of good stories  and bits of trivia, in the words of several of Those Who Were There.  You'll find out, for instance, which segments were actually filmed first,  how amazed Susan Luckey was at Robert Preston's ability to lip-synch  &quot;Trouble&quot; during filming, and why Shirley Jones wore so many  frills and flowers on her dress in the scene at the footbridge.As for  the film itself -- the print is beautiful, and as someone who had only  experienced the film in pan-and-scan format, it is a delight to finally see  entire dance sequences without the cropping.  And you'll finally be able to  see all four members of The Buffalo Bills barber shop quartet (the poor  fellow singing bass could never be seen in TV-formatted versions).There  are other, smaller moments that have always cried our for the letterbox  format, and if you watch both versions closely, you'll notice the real  advantages in seeing the entire scene as it was shot.  For example, one  particularly disorienting scene in pan-and-scan format is the &quot;Pick A  Little, Talk A Little/Goodnight, Ladies&quot; sequence, when Professor Hill  is speaking with Mrs. Shinn and the town ladies about Old Miser Madison,  and dismebodied voices drift in from off camera. At one point, Mrs. Shinn  says, &quot;Miser,&quot; and an off-camera voice says, &quot;Madison,&quot;  causing Mrs. Shinn to grimace.  In pan-and-scan, it looks like a mistake;  in widescreen format, the speaker is finally visible to Mrs. Shinn's right,  bringing the scene together in a logical fashion.  Sounds like a trivial  moment, I know, but that scene in pan-and-scan has grated me for  years!The DVD also contains a theatrical trailer, but it's not the  trailer for the original 1962 release, but for the re-release a number of  years later.  It's still an interesting curiosity, featuring a reworked  version of the &quot;76 Trombones&quot; sequence with Preston signing new  lyrics about the film.If there's any shortcoming in the disc, it lies in  the sound quality.  You'll have to crank the volume up a bit to hear  everything properly, but beware -- the moment you hit the MENU button,  you'll be blasted by and ear-splitting version of &quot;76 Trombones&quot;  on the menu screen.  Ouch.  Hit MUTE right before you touch MENU.  You'll  thank me later.It's a worn out cliche, but they really DON'T make  musicals like this any more.  And if your only experience with THE MUSIC  MAN has been with the pan-and-scan format, do yourself a favor and pick up  either the DVD or the letterboxed VHS format.

I bought this product when it first came out, so I've had it for over ten years. Back in 1999 we were just all awestruck by the fact that a movie would fit on something smaller than a brick (VHS) and might even have room for and contain a featurette. In this case your extra feature is the featurette ""Right Here in River City: The Making of Meredith Willson's The Magic Man"". There are also two trailers, and that is it.Looking at the film today, this disc is a dinosaur. The colors seem runny and the hue a bit off, and the sound is rather uneven. The disc can often be had for a greatly reduced price, and the quality is probably the reason why. This film is ripe for a redo and most probably a Blu-Ray release, so I would save my money until that time, if I was you.As far as the film itself as art, it is one of the great musical motion pictures. I can't imagine anyone but Robert Preston as fast-talking fast-thinking Professor Harold Hill, and then there's my favorite line in the film as spoken by the mayor ""And now I'd like to present a spectacle - my wife."" The music is wonderful and memorable, and the whole thing just captures small-town life at the beginning of the twentieth century in such a charming way. I've liked this film since I was in my 20's, back when I thought that ""The Terminator"" was classic cinema.In summary, I couldn't recommend the film more highly, but as for the DVD I'd wait until Warner Home Video comes out with an upgraded product.

At this point in time, in Hollywood musical history, studios wanted to be certain that they had a &quot;sure thing&quot; before they expended any amount of money on the musical.  Consequently, most of the musicals being made in Hollywood had previously been successful on Broadway.  The same principle applied to &quot;The Music Man.&quot;Director Morton DaCosta and choreographer Onna White also handled the Broadway production and several of the original Broadway cast members were featured in the movie including Pert Kelton, The Buffalo Bills singing quartet and last but not least Robert Preston.  Even though Preston portrayed the dynamic Professor Hill on Broadway, he was awarded the starring role in the movie only after Cary Grant turned down the studio.  Preston's enthusiastic character in the movie, his style, his charm and his personality reflected in Professor Hill are the qualities that went on to make the movie as successful as the Broadway play.  According to Ted Sennett in his book 'Hollywood Musicals,' &quot;His performance is a miracle of energy and drive, perfectly in key to the style and intention of the film.&quot;&quot;The Music Man&quot; centers on down home America, Iowa style, circa 1912.  The crux of the plot involves a fast-talking, good looking, and smooth kind of guy called Professor Harold Hill.  In actuality, he's a con man who goes from small town to small town, making a fast buck.  However, when he arrives in River City, he doesn't realize that he has met his Waterloo.  He proceeds in trying to convince these small town folks that there's 'trouble right here in River City,' referring to the young people who are hanging around with nothing to do.  He puts himself across as a music teacher and tries to get all of the parents to buy band instruments and uniforms in order to form a band that he can instruct.  Wanting to do the best for their children, parents go along with his suggestion, not realizing that he knows nothing about music, bands or band instruments.  Marian (Shirley Jones), the town's librarian sees through his faade but also at the same time, falls in love with him.  The movie ends with the famous song '76 trombones.'The songs in this movie flowed smoothly with the storyline and there was something for everyone.  The production number &quot;The Wells Fargo Wagon&quot; involved members of the whole town, looking and waiting for the Wells Fargo Wagon to deliver all the things that were ordered from the catalogue.  Children and adults alike were all excited about the arrival, which was a big happening in this little town. Robert Preston's rendition of 'Trouble' set the tone for the movie and showed, in music, how he could incite the townspeople and get just what he wanted.  Shirley Jones and Robert Preston vocalizing on 'Till There Was You' made it very clear that they cared deeply for one another and the audience knew, at that point, that he wasn't going to leave River City.  The grand finale, with the marching band playing '76 Trombones' was really the high point of the movie and &quot;...the musical's biggest hit song...which Preston makes virtually his own with every confident stride and strut&quot; (Ted Sennett, &quot;Hollywood Musicals&quot;).  It's a song in the movie where you just had to join in with the music.&quot;The Music Man&quot; is two and a half hours of sheer pleasure. Yes, it was corny, but so were a lot of other musicals.  Maybe that's what made it so appealing.  If it didn't have the staying power it wouldn't be around today, being shown repeatedly on television and being sold on videocassette and DVD.

Playwright/composer Meredith Willson (who grew up in Mason City, IA, in the first two decades of the 20th Century, and played with John Philip Sousa's band) was clearly writing what he knew, and with more than 40 songs--twice or more what most musicals boast--plus several lively dance numbers, it may be the finest of the late MGM examples.  In the year 1912, a man (Robert Preston) who calls himself Prof. Harold Hill (""bandleaders are always called 'Professor'"") comes to River City, IA, and soon persuades the citizens that the presence of a new pool table in their town (quite different, he insists, from a billiard table) is the first step on a slippery slope that will ruin their ""innocent"" sons and daughters, leading to ""horse race gambling"" and dancing to ""shameless"" ragtime music.  His solution?  ""River City needs a boys' band""--for which he is conveniently prepared to order instruments, uniforms, and manuals.  What the audience knows and the Iowans don't is that Hill (not his real name) is a con artist who can't read a note (although, to be fair, the instruments and uniforms do arrive as advertised).  His chief opposition is town librarian Marian Paroo (Shirley Jones), who thinks he's a ""masher"" or worse, so of course he has to try to romance and distract her.  But as he waits for the band equipment to arrive, he finds himself growing genuinely attached to her, her little brother Winthrop (Ronny Howard), and the town itself.  He even does his bit to improve the place: by persuading the members of the School Board (the Buffalo Bills), who've been feuding for 20 years, to sing together in barbershop-quartet fashion, he defuses their rivalries; he engineers what may be the reformation of the local ""wild kid,"" Tommy Djilas (Timmy Everett), and furthers his courtship of Zaneeta Shinn (Susan Luckey), daughter of the mayor (Paul Ford), who happens to own the pool table and so distrusts Hill, and his wife (Hermione Gingold), whom Hill recruits to the band's ""dance committee.""Of course the high point of the film is Preston recreating his original stage role; at 44 he still had a lot of zip, and his flamboyant style perfectly suits the con-artist character he plays.  Jones's soaring soprano is another plus, and it's intriguing to see how, even with Queen Victoria 11 years in her grave, the small towns of America still lived heavily by Victorian codes, with an almost paranoid concentration on appearances and respectability.

The fact that,like Rex Harrison,Preston could not carry a tune makes his performance all the more astonishing.  You would never know after hearing Preston+Jones sing ""Till There was You"" that he was not a singer.

106485,ANIHXYXKPZL2H,0790738074,"C. Roberts ""movie buff""","[4, 4]","Professor Harold Hill (Robert Preston) arrives in River City with a plan to make some money from the gullible citizens. He tells them he is organising a River City Boys Band with the intention of leaving town with their money before the instruments arrive. He hasn't allowed for the fact that he will meet beautiful librarian Marian Paroo (Shirley Jones) and fall for her charms. Marian is at first very suspicious of Hill and then begins to realise he is doing a lot of good things for River City. Hill changes his plan, decides to stay and against all the odds manages to form the boy's band.A high class supporting cast includes Buddy Hackett, Paul Ford (who played the wonderful Colonel Hall in the ""Sergeant Bilko"" TV series), Hermoine Gingold, a very young Ron Howard (only eight years old at the time), Harry Hickox, Percy Helton, Max Showalter and Pert Kelton. The film contained so many outstanding characters expertly portrayed it is difficult to know where to start. Robert Preston of course was ideally cast as Harold Hill - it was the best role of his career and the one he is most fondly remembered for. He worked really hard, put his songs over with style and verve, was full of energy, and seemed to be enjoying himself enormously. The delightful Shirley Jones gave another captivating performance as Marian the librarian and sang several engaging songs throughout the film. Paul Ford was brilliant as Mayor Shinn and had many comic moments trying to have Hill run out of town or sent to jail. Buddy Hackett as Hill's friend Marcellus gets involved with the phoney plan to form the band and does his best to keep Hill out of trouble. Ron Howard impresses with his featured number ""Gary, Indiana"" (which for the sake of the plot he had to sing with a lisp!). Two of my favourite character actors (Percy Helton and Max Showalter) were in the film but only appeared briefly in the opening number which was a shame as I would have preferred to see them do more. (Max Showalter was previously known as Casey Adams and had appeared with Marilyn Monroe in ""Niagara"" and ""Bus Stop"" plus many other films). The ""Buffalo Bills"" barbershop quartet close harmony team sing some nostalgic numbers which are very enjoyable and helped to establish the period atmosphere of the film. Director Morton Da Costa introduced the gimmick of having the screen go dark after several of the musical numbers which I thought was a clever innovation.Some favourite lines from the film:Robert Preston (to Buddy Hackett): ""Must create a desperate need in your town for a boy's band"".Shirley Jones (to Paul Ford): ""Honestly, a bunch of grown men. Along comes this fly by night salesman and you're all taken in!"".Paul Ford: ""I want that man's credentials"".Jones (to Preston): ""The one thing one must remember no matter who one is or what one is working for one can do anything if one puts one's mind to it!"".Preston (to Jones and Ron Howard): ""Well, for the first time in my life - I got my foot caught in the door"".Songs include ""You've Got Trouble Right Here in River City"", ""The Sadder but Wiser Girl for Me"", ""Till There Was You"", ""Goodnight my Someone"", ""Wells Fargo Wagon"", ""Marian the Librarian"" and of course the big show stopper ""Seventy Six Trombones"".""The Music Man"" was definitely one of the best musicals of the sixties and can be seen over and over again with increasing pleasure.

The music was great, the acting very good, but still something didn't seem right. After watching the version staring Matthew Broderick on ABC and loved it, I decided to give the original another try. I've come to the conclusion that the film's major flaw is its cinematography. The film never seems to break past being a Broadway show and most of the staging reflects that. Most of the action takes place just as it would on the stage with little creativity. Even with this flaw, the film is still a lot of fun. Robert Preston's Harold Hill, the traveling con man attempting to swindle the town of River City,  is a remarkable performance. Herminie Granger and Susan Luckey also put in great performances as Mrs. Shinn, the mayor's wife, and her daughter Zaneeta respectively. Shirley Jones also stars as Marian, the town librarian and music teacher that Hill falls in love with.

I certainly cannot add anything to 428 reviews except to explain why I think we like the film so much. Years ago, I saw the Music Man as an outdoor stage production before seeing the motion picture and spent the next day until now (60 years) trying to understand why it did more than entertain. The film is loaded with human values that are not apparent on the surface. The following quote from Cervantes ""Don Quixote"" and then two quotes from Maxwell Maltz' helped me to answer my question. Cervantes said, ""Too much sanity may be madness. And maddest of all, to see life as it is and not as it should be. Maxwell Maltz adds this insight in his book Psycho-Cybernetics: ""Your nervous system cannot tell the difference between an imagined experience and a 'real' experience....Imagination sets the goal picture which our automatic mechanism works on. We act, or fail to act, not because of will, as is so commonly believed, but because of imagination."" (I believe Psycho-Cybernetics is the best psychology book ever written; better perhaps than all other psychology books combined. At one time in my life I was a psychology major so I've read more than a few psychology books.)76 Trombones can lead our big parade. Change what you imagine and you will change your future. Your dreams can come true. What we imagine, embrace, hope for, and love, becomes a part of us that will change who we are.  In this way, we create our mind, our soul, our nature, and our very being. Expecting and imagining our loved ones to be better than they actually are, will lift them up also.See all of my Reviews. I write only about books, events, or motion pictures of enduring significance that have changed the course of history or unforgettable books or motion pictures that will totally change peoples lives.Darrell Stoddard, Founder - Pain Research Institute healpain.net and saveusa.biz",5,The Think System - Seeing things as they should be and not as they are.,1365984000,"04 15, 2013",2013,1985,"['Darrell', 'Stoddard', 'darrellstoddard', 'gmail.comThe', 'ultimate', 'feel', 'good', 'live', 'happily', 'ever', 'motion', 'picture', 'certainly', 'can', 'not', 'add', 'anything', '428', 'reviews', 'explain', 'why', 'think', 'film', 'so', 'much', 'Years', 'ago', 'saw', 'Music', 'Man', 'outdoor', 'stage', 'production', 'seeing', 'motion', 'picture', 'spent', 'next', 'day', 'now', '60', 'years', 'trying', 'understand', 'why', 'did', 'more', 'entertain', 'film', 'loaded', 'human', 'values', 'are', 'not', 'apparent', 'surface', 'following', 'quote', 'Cervantes', 'Don', 'Quixote', 'then', 'two', 'quotes', 'Maxwell', 'Maltz', 'helped', 'answer', 'question', 'Cervantes', 'said', 'Too', 'much', 'sanity', 'may', 'be', 'madness', 'maddest', 'see', 'life', 'not', 'should', 'be', 'Maxwell', 'Maltz', 'insight', 'book', 'Psycho-Cybernetics', 'nervous', 'system', 'can', 'not', 'tell', 'difference', 'imagined', 'experience', ""'real"", 'experience', '.Imagination', 'goal', 'picture', 'automatic', 'mechanism', 'act', 'fail', 'act', 'not', 'will', 'so', 'commonly', 'believed', 'imagination', 'believe', 'Psycho-Cybernetics', 'best', 'psychology', 'book', 'ever', 'written', 'better', 'perhaps', 'other', 'psychology', 'books', 'combined', 'one', 'time', 'life', 'was', 'psychology', 'major', 'so', ""'ve"", 'read', 'more', 'few', 'psychology', 'books', '76', 'Trombones', 'can', 'lead', 'big', 'parade', 'Change', 'what', 'imagine', 'will', 'change', 'future', 'dreams', 'can', 'come', 'true', 'What', 'imagine', 'embrace', 'hope', 'love', 'part', 'will', 'change', 'who', 'are', 'way', 'create', 'mind', 'soul', 'nature', 'very', 'being', 'Expecting', 'imagining', 'loved', 'ones', 'be', 'better', 'actually', 'are', 'will', 'lift', 'up', 'Reviews', 'write', 'only', 'about', 'books', 'events', 'motion', 'pictures', 'enduring', 'significance', 'have', 'changed', 'course', 'history', 'unforgettable', 'books', 'motion', 'pictures', 'will', 'totally', 'change', 'peoples', 'lives.Darrell', 'Stoddard', 'Founder', 'Pain', 'Research', 'Institute', 'healpain.net', 'saveusa.biz']",N/A

Robert Preston encores his role from Broadway as Prof. Hill, Shirley Jones plays Marion the Librarian. Great music with some terrific ensemble numbers such as &quot;Iowa Stubborn&quot;, &quot;Pick a Little Talk a Little&quot;, &quot;Wells Fargo Wagon&quot; and of course, &quot;76 Trombones&quot; make for a joyful musical experience. The story is a little contrived but so what. You'll enjoy suspending your jaded 21st Century sensibilities as you fall in to this tale of a small time sales-hustler at loose in an Iowa Stubborn small town. It's still a fun tale full of swagger and exaggerated Midwestern small town values as imagined by Meredith Wilson's romantic pen. And of course there are the great barbershop quartet numbers sung by the Buffalo Bills that fit seamlessly in this lively production. Pop this disc in your player and you'll be humming the songs for days.&quot;Marion the Librarian&quot;, &quot;The Sadder but Wiser Gal&quot;, &quot;Lida Rose&quot;, a very young Ron Howard singing &quot;Gary, Indiana&quot;, &quot;Goodnight my Someone&quot;, &quot;Ya Got Trouble&quot; (with a capitol T and that rhymes with P and that stands for Pool!&quot;), &quot;Shipoopi&quot; (the girl that's hard to get),.

It tells the tale of a small American town when everyone knew everyone else - when you didn't have to lock and bolt your doors. When having a alarm system wasn't in 3/4 of every new home built. And you could ride your bike everywhere without fear of being ran over.I grew up in such a town. I didn't realize it until much later but my grandfather and 2 of his brothers owned about 50% of the town that I grew up in central Indiana. My grandfather, for example, owned 14 houses, the post office building, his auto repair place and a small strip mall. It seemed that at least 1/2 of the town was related to me in some matter.But enough of that - this movie will stir feelings in anyone who grew up in a small town environment. It is very well done and has a good acting job by Ron Howard, who even sings, well, more like lisps, 'Gary, Indiana'. And, of course, who hasn't heard 'the song, '76 Trombones'. I only wish one of our Librarians looked like Shirley Jones. This is a great story that quite simply could NOT get funding to be made today - nothing is blown up and no one get killed. The ending is great even through it's a very predictable Hollywood ending.I get a kick that ANYONE could believe they can be taught to simply THINK about playing a musical instrument and be able to do so.It's interesting that this movie beat 'West Side Story' for the Tony in 1962.BTW - one of my relatives, Forrest Tucker, had played the lead role on the stage and, according to my mom, lobbied hard to get the movie role. But It's hard to imagine anyone other than Robert Preston playing Professor Harold Hill.This picture is top notch as is the overall acting and direction.

Don't look for a message, there really isn't one - the one attempt at one, when Harold Hill tells little Winthrop that he always thinks there's a band, is not only maudlin, it's manifestly untrue: Harold's a con man plain and simple, not a salesman who has bought his own sales pitch.

Snyder,"[3, 3]","The Music Man, Meredith Willson's fond remembrance of his early 1900s childhood in Iowa, was one of the most successful transitions from a Broadway musical to a film version. While the movie opened up the scope with street scenes, it also retained many of the stage effects such as isolated singing of duets on a blackout stage, with singers highlighted by spotlights, and soundstage settings like the library and the picnic. The DVD was fine for the era of 26-inch televisions, but the color and fine detail suffered on large modern screens. A Blu-ray transcription was eagerly awaited.No films benefit more from high-definition treatment than old musicals, given that their enjoyment depends heavily on quality sound reproduction, and the accurate presentation of a vibrant color scheme. The Blu-ray edition of The Music Man brings this film to life as it has not been seen since its original theatrical showings in 1962. Compared side-by-side with the DVD, the Blu-ray offers greatly improved video, with sharply resolved fine detail. The 5.1 surround sound does justice to Shirley Jones' beautiful voice in her role as Marian the Librarian, and to Robert Preston's rapid-fire flights of musical fantasy, as he weaves his con-man story of Professor Harold Hill, the Music Man.Many of the finest character actors in Hollywood make up the population of River City, Iowa. Of special note are Paul Ford and Hermoine Gingold as Mayor and Mrs. Shinn, and Ron Howard as Marian the Librarian's younger brother Winthrop. This film is pure enjoyment from the opening credits all the way through to the triumphal march of the 76 trombones at the end.

Thanks to the Shirley Jones-hosted documentary included on disc, I now know he hailed from small-town Iowa.  I appreciate all the more those exquisite little details in the film that turn River City from stock caricature set into living, breathing character.Any movie musical is bound to split into two separate films:  the exquisite musical numbers, with their witty rhymes, elaborately choreographed dance sequences, and impact on the plot; and then the perfunctory, stilted dialogue bits that bridge those numbers (if you want to see this theory in action, rent ""West Side Story"").Thanks to Willson, ""The Music Man"", however, is perfect in that its linking ""book"" portions are just as successful as the musical numbers.  And we're talking some pretty heavy musical numbers too.  Nearly every song in the film is worth memorizing -- if you can manage to catch all the words!  I thought I had them commited to memory years ago, but then I watched the DVD release with the English subtitles on, and realized I'd been missing entire lines -- good lines, too.The DVD presentation is sound.  The audio quality suffers, most notably during the dialogue-only portions.  As I said, the presenttion is ""sound"".

106543,A3QTP2CI1BDV0M,0790738074,"Jim O'Brien ""JamesMark""","[4, 4]","This musical still delights and charms us ... more than 40 years after it was made.  It earns our applause the old fashion way - with good solid song and dance entertainment.Robert Preston shines as Professor Harold Hill ... an unscrupulous con man who sets out to deceive the entire population (about 2,400) of River City, Iowa.  He charms his way into their hearts (and pocketbooks) and manages to stay one step ahead of the authorities.Along the way, he (Prof. Hill) touches the lives of a spinster-to-be (Shirley Jones as Marian the Librarian) and her extremely shy little brother Winthrop (played by a very young and adorable Ronnie Howard) and, to his surprise, he finds himself in the unfamiliar territory of a good-doer.  His planned escape thereby stalled, he is caught, and must, um, face the music.Along the way we are given quite a few memorable and fun songs and some delightful dance routines.  The movie makers showed some pluck ... using some imagination and taking some chances ... and gave us a lot of entertainment.  My favorite spots are the opening train sequence and the very excellent dance (and song) scene inside the library.The River City townsfolk are made out to be stubborn and narrow minded ... but in fact they are each comedy producers.  Virtually every adult character in the movie delivers his or her share of the workload ... and adds humor to the overall fun of the picture.  Paul Ford, as the befuddled Mayor George Shinn, is particularly good ... and Hermione Gingold, who plays his wife Eulalie, is funny also (though in a different way).Shirley Jones is pretty good here.  She's always been a great singer, but she does some effective acting and fancy footwork here as well.  Pert Kelton, as her Irish-brogued mother, is a delight.  But the show pretty much belongs to Robert Preston.  A most able entertainer, he is light on his feet, and equally as nimble (and agile) while handling his lines.  He's not a great singer ... he speaks most of the lyrics to his songs ... but they (the songs) work, and they work well.I had heard that, in the pre-production phase of making the movie, they wanted to replace Robert Preston (the star of the stage version of ""The Music Man"") with someone else.  Meredith Willson, the writer of the original story, gave them an ultimatum ... either Robert Preston stays or ... no movie.  And, watching him (Preston) perform here, it's easy to understand that feeling.  He is a delight.An interesting side note is that, in the movie, Prof. Harold Hill didn't actually do anything wrong.  I mean, he didn't break a single law.  He promised them band instruments and uniforms ... and he delivered them.  He promised to organize and lead a boys band ... and he does.  And yet, they arrested him and prepared to ""tar and feather"" him when, in fact, he hadn't done anything wrong.",5,Fun Movie,1122336000,"07 26, 2005",2005,2844,"['musical', 'still', 'delights', 'charms', 'more', '40', 'years', 'was', 'made', 'old', 'fashion', 'way', 'good', 'solid', 'song', 'dance', 'entertainment.Robert', 'Preston', 'shines', 'Professor', 'Harold', 'Hill', 'unscrupulous', 'con', 'man', 'who', 'out', 'deceive', 'entire', 'population', '2,400', 'River', 'City', 'Iowa', 'way', 'hearts', 'stay', 'one', 'step', 'ahead', 'authorities.Along', 'way', 'Prof.', 'Hill', 'lives', 'spinster-to-be', 'Shirley', 'Jones', 'Marian', 'Librarian', 'extremely', 'shy', 'little', 'brother', 'Winthrop', 'played', 'very', 'young', 'adorable', 'Ronnie', 'Howard', 'surprise', 'unfamiliar', 'territory', 'good-doer', 'planned', 'escape', 'thereby', 'stalled', 'caught', 'must', 'um', 'face', 'music.Along', 'way', 'are', 'given', 'quite', 'few', 'memorable', 'fun', 'songs', 'delightful', 'dance', 'routines', 'movie', 'makers', 'showed', 'pluck', 'using', 'imagination', 'taking', 'chances', 'gave', 'lot', 'entertainment', 'favorite', 'spots', 'are', 'opening', 'train', 'sequence', 'very', 'excellent', 'dance', 'song', 'scene', 'library.The', 'River', 'City', 'townsfolk', 'are', 'made', 'out', 'be', 'stubborn', 'narrow', 'minded', 'fact', 'are', 'comedy', 'producers', 'Virtually', 'adult', 'character', 'movie', 'share', 'workload', 'humor', 'overall', 'fun', 'picture', 'Paul', 'Ford', 'befuddled', 'Mayor', 'George', 'Shinn', 'particularly', 'good', 'Hermione', 'Gingold', 'who', 'wife', 'Eulalie', 'funny', 'also', 'different', 'way', '.Shirley', 'Jones', 'pretty', 'good', 'here', 'always', 'been', 'great', 'singer', 'effective', 'acting', 'fancy', 'footwork', 'here', 'as', 'well', 'Pert', 'Kelton', 'Irish-brogued', 'mother', 'delight', 'show', 'pretty', 'much', 'belongs', 'Robert', 'Preston', 'most', 'able', 'entertainer', 'light', 'feet', 'equally', 'nimble', 'agile', 'handling', 'lines', 'not', 'great', 'singer', 'most', 'lyrics', 'songs', 'songs', 'work', 'work', 'well.I', 'had', 'heard', 'pre-production', 'phase', 'making', 'movie', 'wanted', 'replace', 'Robert', 'Preston', 'star', 'stage', 'version', 'Music', 'Man', 'someone', 'else', 'Meredith', 'Willson', 'writer', 'original', 'story', 'gave', 'ultimatum', 'Robert', 'Preston', 'movie', 'watching', 'Preston', 'perform', 'here', 'easy', 'understand', 'feeling', 'delight.An', 'interesting', 'side', 'note', 'movie', 'Prof.', 'Harold', 'Hill', 'did', ""n't"", 'actually', 'do', 'anything', 'wrong', 'mean', 'did', ""n't"", 'break', 'single', 'law', 'promised', 'band', 'instruments', 'uniforms', 'delivered', 'promised', 'organize', 'lead', 'boys', 'band', 'yet', 'arrested', 'prepared', 'tar', 'feather', 'when', 'fact', 'had', ""n't"", 'done', 'anything', 'wrong']",N/A

What I mean is that it fits the stereotypical movie musical: a little cheesy, characters ready to burst into song and dance at any moment, and with backgrounds that look like they were painted in.  Despite that, or perhaps because of it, ""The Music Man"" works.The premise of ""The Music Man"" is that a traveling salesman, Harold Hill (Robert Preston) comes to River City, Iowa with the intent to con the town into buying instruments and uniforms to form a boys marching band.  Harold Hill just has to convince the town that they both need and want a marching band.  He begins to win over the town, despite not having any musical ability, and has nearly everyone conned except for the librarian, Marian (Shirley Jones).  To win her, he tries to woo her.  He is incredibly charming and smooth, but it isn't until the kids begin being excited about music that Marian even begins to crack.There are some very good songs in this musical.  ""76 Trombones"" is a classic, but my favorite was ""Marian the Librarian"".  There is a certain amount of sweetness and nostalgia to this movie.  It is definitely an old time movie that the whole family can watch together.  The one thing that surprised me the most was a young Ron Howard was in this movie (he was the kid with the lisp).

Comedian Buddy Hackett adds levity as Hill's goofy sidekick, while Jones is a perfectly prim counterweight to Preston's engaging rogue.

106555,AA3EC3LKOBD80,0790738074,Jonathan Cohen,"[6, 6]","""The Music Man"" is, for my money, the definitive piece of musical Americana. It's also my all-time favorite Hollywood musical, a movie I've loved every minute of ever since I first saw it in my hometown theater at age 7 or so. Now, thanks to this excellent DVD, everyone who loves great musicals can enjoyit.What makes ""The Music Man"" so special? That's easy: the great Meredith Willson and his rollicking, rousing, hilarious songs, story and script (the latter faithfully adapted by Hollywood veteran Marion ""See Here, Private"" Hargrove). Nobody ever wrote better, wittier or livelier comic patter songs, and nobody delivered them better than Robert Preston- who, nearly half a century after his Broadway debut and many years after his death, IS Professor Harold Hill. Preston still bursts through your screen with his confident, exuberant and mesmerizing turn as the world's most famous flim-flam man, that wannabe bandleader who jumps the train to put one over on those straitlaced rubes from River City, Iowa. I still think ""Trouble In River City"" is the greatest comic number of its kind ever, and if ""Seventy-Six Trombones"" doesn't get you marching around the room, go call your local funeral director. ""The Wells Fargo Wagon"", ""Gary, Indiana"", ""Pick-A-Little""- it just never stops. What a clever, unique lyricist Willson was! Of course, he wrote lovely ballads here too: ""Goodnight, My Someone"", ""Till There Was You"" (legitimized by the Beatles, of all people, who sang it on their ""Ed Sullivan"" debut), and my lifelong barbershop favorite, ""Lida Rose"".Preston isn't the only one who delivers the goods on this fabulous score. Shirley Jones was a huge musical star by now (and an Oscar-winning dramatic actress too); she's just right as the prim-and-proper Marian, madame librarian and piano teacher, who happens to sing like an angel even if she sees Hill's game right away. I love her ""Will I Ever Tell You"" counterpoint to ""Lida Rose"". Little Ronny Howard, then known as ""Opie"" from ""Andy Griffith"" and decades away from becoming a beloved movie director, is great as lisping, towheaded Winthrop (who gets to sing parts of ""Gary, Indiana"" and ""Wells Fargo""). Even Buddy Hackett, whose mush-mouthed Flatbush accent sounds way out of place in this heartland setting, does his best as Hill's old buddy Marcellus as he introduces ""Shipoopi"", the big square dance number at the ice cream social.Most of the supporting cast were well-worn comic character actors who'd been around forever and fit the turn-of-the-century, ""American Gothic"" (look for the sight gag based on that Iowa icon) setting perfectly: Paul Ford as the scatter-brained, huffy mayor; Hermione Gingold as his stuck-up wife (I love how she says ""BALL-zak!""); Pert Kelton as homespun Mrs. Paroo; and the Buffalo Bills- not the football team, but one of America's great barbershop quartets (named for their hometown)- who add old-time vaudeville intros to their precious, old-time harmonies.This movie runs 2 1/2 hours but doesn't slow down for a minute. In addition, the widescreen presentation allows for clear, bright looks at the lively dance numbers and gingerbread-Midwest settings. A nice old-timey touch was added by director Morton DaCosta, better known for his excellent stage work capped by this original Broadway show; he employed the silent-era ""iris""shot to give Hill and Marian a quaint, yet warm, ""footlight"" glow as their numbers fade out.There's also a nice half-hour feature on the movie (and stage play)'s history, featuring the still-gracious Shirley Jones(Preston passed away in the '80s). Onna White, the choreographer on both versions, also appears; her work took weeks, and it shows. Who else pulled off a delicate, ten-minute soft shoe in a library? Oddly enough, Warner wanted Sinatra- Sinatra!- for the Hill role. But Willson was ""Iowa Stubborn"" enough, she says, to say ""No Preston, no picture"". Can you imagine Ol' Blue Eyes in that band outfit? Me, neither. It's also well-known that Shirley was very pregnant while doing this movie. The answer? Well, check out the July 4th pageant scenes and the slide that gets slipped into the ""Columbia"" number!There's a reason- actually, a lot of reasons- why ""The Music Man"" is still staged, revived, remade and loved even by the most jaded, sophisticated ""blue-state"" audiences. But why should I tell you what they are? Go rent or get this DVD for yourself.

The film is a knockout, crammed to the rafters with wonderful actors--Robert Preston, who was born to portray Professor Harold Hill; Shirley Jones, ever the radiant ingenue; and a host of irreplaceable character actors--Paul Ford, Hermione Gingold, Pert Kelton, Mary Wickes,and Buddy Hackett among them.  You'll even see an eight-year-old Ron Howard in his pre-Opie days, lending a certain poignancy to the story.  ""The Music Man"" concerns ""Professor"" Harold Hill, a slick charlatan who falls unexpectedly for Marian, the strait-laced but ultimately enchanting town librarian.  Along the way Composer/Author Willson pokes affectionate fun at the Iowans of his boyhood, and also offers some wickedly clever numbers--notably a rap-like opener--and such lovely standards as ""Goodnight, My Someone"" and ""Till There Was You.""  There's also a terrific dance number, ""Shipoopi,"" which, though it  adds nothing to the story, is nevertheless an eye-popping delight.  The number took several weeks to film, and parts of it were shot from a height of 76 feet above the sound stage (in sly tribute to the trombones of the movie's grand finale).

But, the orginal is the best version for any Broadway buff to see. The Music Man has Robert Preston who is best known and loved for his role of Professor Howard Hill in the Music Man. (Robert Preston also played the role on Broadway). With show-stopping songs and dance sequences and good humor this movie is perfect for fans of good impressive old-fashioned musicals and old family films.The movie centers around Proffesor Howard Hill a con man who cons towns into payng him money to run a boy's band. Only Howard Hill dosn't know how to carry a tune. When Howard Hill lands in the small- stubborn town of River City, Iwoa. He encounters a few problems with his scheme a libraian Marian who gives piano lessons that his hard to trick or con. But, Professor Howard Hill, manages with his suave naure to trick the town into his plan while falling for Marian.  Well, eventually it comes to the point where Howard Hill must reveal his plan to the rest of the town-so he can stay in the town with Marian. Only will the town forgive him? Or is it going to take a miracle to pull his scheme off?With such cathcy tunes as ""Seventy-Six Trombones"" and ""Shoop-ee"" It's easy to see why this film was such a big hit and why it remains a classic musical. THis musical is great to watch with the kids and even us grown-ups will find ourselves singing along. Robert Preston is absolutely brillant in the role of Howard Hill it's hard for me to imagine anyone else playing that role-but him. He REALLY makes the movie.

This is a musical and it's most likely the film that made me love musicals. Robert Preston, though not alive anymore, was one of the greatest Broadway stars. He played The Music Man in Broadway shows, and he did it so well that he was cast as The Music Man for this movie, even though he was 16 years older than the woman who would be playing his love interest. The name of his character is Professor Harold Hill. He's a con man who cons his way into peoples' hearts by selling band instruments and uniforms to the kids, with the intent of teaching the kids how to use the instruments, and then skipping town with all the money instead of truly teaching the kids how to play their instruments. He also cons his way into the hearts of maiden librarians by attempting to make them fall in love with him so that they won't attempt to discredit him. There's something about Iowa, though, that makes him want to stay. He loved Iowa. He loved the town, the people, and he fell in love with Marian the librarian. Marian, played by Shirley Jones, was able to see right through his act at first. However, when he kept his promise and delivered her brothers' instrument to him, she started falling in love with him. It may have been Harold Hill's dream to start a band because there's a sequence where he's on the footbridge and he's looking into the water. He's imagining there's a band playing their instruments and he's the band leader. So, in every sense of the word, being a band leader may be what he wants, but it ended up turning out somewhat differently. In the end of the movie, a man goes to Iowa and tells the whole town that Harold Hill is a crook, he doesn't know how to play a single note of music and he's just out to get their money. The people of the town find Harold and take him to a town meeting where they discuss having him tarred and feathered. Marian stands up for him though. During the town meeting, the boys come in wearing their band uniforms and have their instruments in hand and Marian encourages Harold to lead the band in song so that the people in town will be able to see that he can lead a band and he wasn't conning them all along. He was conning them, but Marian believed in him enough to coerce him to try leading the band. Harold doesn't believe that he could do it at first, but then, in a moment of integrity, he leads them in a song called Beethoven's Minuet in G. Then they all march outside and play the song called 76 Trombones.It's probably more boring to read about this than it would be to watch it. I edited some of what I was going to say because if you've never seen the movie, you might find it tedious to read what happens throughout the movie word for word.Shirley Jones was both beautiful and classy in this movie and Robert Preston is The Music Man. Nobody has ever played the part like he could, or better than he could. These aren't just people they saw on the street and decided to make them movie stars. These actors have been studying acting for years. They take their jobs seriously because they want to perfect the art of acting. In this movie, the acting is superb. I know because I saw the newer version of this movie, and the acting in the newer version wasn't the best.

106582,A2AOZQ3WTNVVOK,0790738074,"Lonnie E. Holder ""The Review's the Thing""","[7, 7]","From the opening scene of this movie to the final march down Main Street, this is a movie musical that translates well from its play origins. Quite often the songs in a musical come across as filler, not traveling well from stage production to a movie. However, each and every song in this movie is not only entertaining, they are used to advance the plot.Our story is about one Professor Harold Hill, who organizes boy's bands in small towns across the Midwest, while using this philanthropic enterprise to put a few dollars into his own pocket. That Professor Harold Hill does not know one note of music doesn't seem to stand in his way. As with all great scam artists, the scam works only for the length of time that the scam artist doesn't care. In this movie, Harold Hill begins to care, which leads ultimately to his undoing.Professor Harold Hill is played by Robert Preston. This role was Robert Preston's definitive career moment, and has set the standard for any would-be Harold Hill of the future. The role of the librarian, the character that ultimately led to Harold Hill's undoing, is played by Shirley Jones, never looking more worldly, pretty and yet innocent than she did in this role.In addition to Robert Preston and Shirley Jones at a peak in their acting careers, this movie boasts a supporting cast that includes Buddy Hackett, Hermione Gingold and Ron Howard. While the well-known cast members tend to overshadow the rest of the cast, the quality of the supporting actors well-matches those of the leads.While the movie is entertaining, it is also an allegory regarding life, particularly life in small towns. Fortunately, the movie does not become overburdened with trying to detail and resolve too many problems. Instead we focus primarily on Marian Paroo (Jones) and Harold Hill. Even Winthrop Paroo's (Ron Howard) lisp is used to support the evolution of Marian's character, as she sees the changes that Harold Hill enacts upon the town.Of course we know that this movie has a happy ending, as most musicals do, but it is the resolution of the problems and a defining moment near the end of the movie that make you realize the movie was deeper than you might have originally expected.Marian is seeking depth and breadth in life, and the small town in Iowa in which she lives, with its shallow, narrow-minded people, have placed her in an intellectual prison. Frustrated, unhappy, she appeals to the younger generation with their open minds to overcome the rut in which their small town appears stuck. Harold Hill sparks a fire in the people of River City that causes the people to look at themselves and the world in a very different way. Marian admires the radical change that Hill is able to cause, and particularly the speed with which he is able to cause it. You suspect that she yearns to be able to create such changes herself. She values the abilities that Harold Hill has, and sees that he can be a force for positive change if properly directed.Harold Hill, on the other hand, is brought to the realization that he has been drifting through life, and that the abilities he has can be used for something other than scamming people. For the first time in his life, Harold Hill cares, and it is his undoing. You also sense that perhaps Hill has been doing this for too long, and the comparison with Marcellus Washburn (Hackett), who has settled into River City and made a home and a life for himself, is such that Harold realizes that he is missing out on a part of life that he never knew he was missing until he met Marian.The final scene of the movie always inspires me. If you want to feel good, reel forward to the picnic in the park and watch the movie from there. When the band plays, badly, for the first time, and you see the pride of the people in the town, at first you want to laugh. But then the band becomes a full marching band with hundreds of members and bright uniforms and shiny instruments. It is at this moment that you realize that in small towns, and in many bigger towns, the pride of the town in what they have reflects in how they see things like the town band. To outsiders the band may appear to be small, with the skill level less than adequate, but for River City the band is every bit as fine as the Philadelphia Philharmonic.This movie is a bit of nostalgia.

Taking an unintended challenge, he gets off in River City, Iowa.  While the locals at first appear cold, his charm soon changes their minds.  Or almost all of them.  Marion, the local librarian and piano teacher, is convenienced that the professor isn't all he claims to be.  Meanwhile, Harold has set his sites on wooing the spinster librarian.  Will he win her heart or hurt her?  Will the townspeople find out the truth, or will this encounter change everyone for the better?As much as I love musicals, I had missed this one until the recent ABC movie version.  I fell immediately under its charming spell.  The story is fun and the music is fantastic.  After enjoying the remake so much, I was looking forward to watching the original, and it didn't disappointment.  The cast, lead by Robert Preston and Shirley Jones, is strong.  The chorography makes me want to join in the fun (always a must for a musical), and the story fleshes out a couple minor points I had missed in the remake.  And I simply must praise the work of the Buffalo Bills as the school board.  They've inspired me in my search for good barbershop quartet music.The DVD preserves the movie well.  The widescreen picture is sharp and clear and the sound is just fine.  Watching the trailer for the reissue shows just how much work has gone into the restoration.  Shirley Jones provides an interesting intro and serves as host for the behind the scenes special.This is a classic musical that everyone will enjoy.

Doyle ""film buff""","[3, 3]","It seems that no other Broadway musical was ever transferred so intact to the screen with every facet of its production gleaming and gloriously theatrical in its staging. River City, Iowa, of course, looks no more realistic than the Land of Oz, but that's how it should be. It's satire, and thankfully director Morton DaCosta keeps it all in tip-top shape, preserved to play exactly as it did on stage, even with respect to the opening number aboard a train where all the salesmen are singing about a certain scoundrel posing as a professor of music.Meredith Willson's music never sounded as good and is given expert singing and dancing from ROBERT PRESTON, SHIRLEY JONES, PAUL FORD and HERMIONE GINGOLD in the leads, all of whom are aided and abetted by some of the best singing and dancing you could ask for in a musical of this kind. Gingold is outrageously funny and Paul Ford as her husband, the Mayor of River City, is equally boisterous in a comic role. But it's Preston's show from start to finish with co-star Shirley Jones in fine vocal form as the skeptical librarian.One of the most cleverly staged numbers is the ""Marian, The Librarian"" number that takes place in the town library where sliding poles and balconies become part of the intricately staged dance routine. All of the musical numbers are performed with professional charm by a talented group of actors/singers/dancers who are part of the River City citizenry.Little Ron Howard, the boy with the lisp, who later went on to directorial fame, is a standout as Jones' little brother.Summing up: Outstanding old-fashioned musical with its heart in the right place--Americana in the best tradition of the word.Summing up: It has more charm than the law allows.",5,One of the most enjoyable movie musicals ever...,1279929600,"07 24, 2010",2010,1728,"['other', 'Broadway', 'musical', 'was', 'ever', 'transferred', 'so', 'intact', 'screen', 'facet', 'production', 'gleaming', 'gloriously', 'theatrical', 'staging', 'River', 'City', 'Iowa', 'course', 'more', 'realistic', 'Land', 'Oz', 'how', 'should', 'be', 'satire', 'thankfully', 'director', 'Morton', 'DaCosta', 'tip-top', 'shape', 'preserved', 'play', 'exactly', 'did', 'stage', 'even', 'respect', 'opening', 'number', 'train', 'where', 'salesmen', 'are', 'singing', 'certain', 'scoundrel', 'posing', 'professor', 'music.Meredith', 'Willson', 'music', 'never', 'sounded', 'good', 'given', 'expert', 'singing', 'dancing', 'ROBERT', 'PRESTON', 'SHIRLEY', 'JONES', 'PAUL', 'FORD', 'HERMIONE', 'GINGOLD', 'leads', 'whom', 'are', 'aided', 'abetted', 'best', 'singing', 'dancing', 'could', 'ask', 'musical', 'kind', 'Gingold', 'outrageously', 'funny', 'Paul', 'Ford', 'husband', 'Mayor', 'River', 'City', 'equally', 'boisterous', 'comic', 'role', 'Preston', 'show', 'start', 'finish', 'co-star', 'Shirley', 'Jones', 'fine', 'vocal', 'form', 'skeptical', 'librarian.One', 'most', 'cleverly', 'staged', 'numbers', 'Marian', 'Librarian', 'number', 'place', 'town', 'library', 'where', 'sliding', 'poles', 'balconies', 'become', 'part', 'intricately', 'staged', 'dance', 'routine', 'musical', 'numbers', 'are', 'performed', 'professional', 'charm', 'talented', 'group', 'actors/singers/dancers', 'who', 'are', 'part', 'River', 'City', 'citizenry.Little', 'Ron', 'Howard', 'boy', 'lisp', 'who', 'later', 'went', 'directorial', 'fame', 'standout', 'Jones', 'little', 'brother.Summing', 'up', 'Outstanding', 'old-fashioned', 'musical', 'heart', 'right', 'place', 'Americana', 'best', 'tradition', 'word.Summing', 'up', 'more', 'charm', 'law']",N/A

This poignant, hilarious and tuneful musical captivated audiences during a decade of anti-heroes, drug culture exploration and realism cinema, proving that no matter the age, fantasy will always have a place in the hearts and minds of film goers.  Preston is Professor Harold Hill, a con artist who arrives in the nimbled-headed town of River City, determined to brainwash its citizens with the prospect of purchasing a boy's band which, of course, he's more than willing to sell to them.  However, on this trip Harold falls for Marianne the librarian (Shirley Jones), a stuck up spinster whose heart melts like butter on the persuasive powers of the con man's band leading baton.  How does it all come out - with fanfare and music and Buddy Hackett puffing on a tuba. Don't ask!Warner Home Video has done a fantastic job remastering this film for DVD.  Colors are sharp, bold and well balanced. The anamorphic transfer captures all of the beauty and feel good vibrations of the score and performances.  The 5.1 mix is a nice touch.

If a movie doesn't have anything to do with explosions, hi-jackings, car chases, guys fighting, extortion, nazis, armageddon, aliens, sports, then it is, IMHO, worthless. But there are a handful of exceptions. The Music Man is one of them. Who doesn't like GREASE, or WEST SIDE STORY? Like these other ROMEO &amp; JULIET knock-offs, The Music Man captures the most ubiquitous theme the filmworld has to offer, and does so with a passion rarely realized. Think of Harold Hill as Romeo, and Marian as Juliet. The thought of them co-mingling disgusts everyone from the mayor, to the anvil salesman. That is, ALMOST everyone. A few River City denizens root for the union. Even encouraging it in their own subtle ways. In this great telling, they don't even die!There is so much to say. The dance routine in the library is stunning. People jumping over tables, twisting and turning in staggering unison. Even a line dance! Infact, nearly every scene is dance. These gifted players can't walk down a dirt street without dancing. Even when their not dancing, their dancing! So, chalk one up for the choreographers as well as the players.Meredith Wilson's score (he also penned), is as cool today as it must've been in 1960. Top tunes include &quot;Trouble&quot;, &quot;76 Trombones&quot;, &quot;Madame Librian&quot;, &quot;Gary Indiana&quot;, and &quot;til There Was You&quot;. Another customer commenter brlliantly noted that &quot;til There Was You&quot;, was actually recorded by the Beatles on one of their early albums. How cool is that! The songs and music are simply awesome.Tiled with talented character actors, this fascinating and highly entertaining film is an absolute must see for anyone who loves musicals, and especially for those, like myself, who can barely tolerate them. One of the best of the best.But back to Romeo and Juliet. Shirley Jones, as Juliet, seems to approach her role as a seasoned pro giving it her usual all. Robert Preston, as Romeo, seems to realize this is the role of alifetime. He'd won a Tony for his stage rendition of Professor Harold Hill, and sinks his teeth into the film adaptation with a superb alacrity. It is often said he became hopelessly typecast because of his sunny performance, but after looking him up in film books, that appears to be part of the MUSIC MAN mythology. He was never without work. Hermione Gingold appears as the Mayor's wife and is best remembered for her portrayal as a wicked witch in the Wizard of Oz. Paul Ford is at his bumblng best as the tongue-tied mayor. A young Ronnie Howard displays his gifts as the kid who wants to believe in Hill, but can't decide if he should. Many others round out the powerhouse cast, and all contribute to this triumphant tale of the turn of the century heartland. &quot;Just think....&quot;.",5,A RARE GEM,995673600,"07 21, 2001",2001,2811,"['hate', 'musicals', 'movie', ""n't"", 'have', 'anything', 'do', 'explosions', 'hi-jackings', 'car', 'chases', 'guys', 'fighting', 'extortion', 'nazis', 'armageddon', 'aliens', 'sports', 'then', 'IMHO', 'worthless', 'are', 'handful', 'exceptions', 'Music', 'Man', 'one', 'Who', ""n't"", 'like', 'GREASE', 'WEST', 'SIDE', 'STORY', 'other', 'ROMEO', 'amp', 'JULIET', 'knock-offs', 'Music', 'Man', 'most', 'ubiquitous', 'theme', 'filmworld', 'offer', 'so', 'passion', 'rarely', 'realized', 'Think', 'Harold', 'Hill', 'Romeo', 'Marian', 'Juliet', 'thought', 'co-mingling', 'disgusts', 'everyone', 'mayor', 'anvil', 'salesman', 'ALMOST', 'everyone', 'few', 'River', 'City', 'root', 'union', 'Even', 'encouraging', 'own', 'subtle', 'ways', 'great', 'telling', 'do', ""n't"", 'even', 'die', 'so', 'much', 'say', 'dance', 'routine', 'library', 'stunning', 'People', 'jumping', 'tables', 'twisting', 'turning', 'staggering', 'unison', 'Even', 'line', 'dance', 'Infact', 'nearly', 'scene', 'dance', 'gifted', 'players', 'ca', ""n't"", 'walk', 'down', 'dirt', 'street', 'dancing', 'Even', 'when', 'not', 'dancing', 'dancing', 'So', 'chalk', 'one', 'up', 'choreographers', 'as', 'well', 'players.Meredith', 'Wilson', 'score', 'also', 'penned', 'cool', 'today', 'must', ""'ve"", 'been', '1960', 'Top', 'tunes', 'include', 'quot', 'Trouble', 'quot', 'quot', '76', 'Trombones', 'quot', 'quot', 'Madame', 'Librian', 'quot', 'quot', 'Gary', 'Indiana', 'quot', 'quot', 'Was', 'quot', 'customer', 'commenter', 'brlliantly', 'noted', 'quot', 'Was', 'quot', 'was', 'actually', 'recorded', 'Beatles', 'one', 'early', 'albums', 'How', 'cool', 'songs', 'music', 'are', 'simply', 'awesome.Tiled', 'talented', 'character', 'actors', 'fascinating', 'highly', 'entertaining', 'film', 'absolute', 'must', 'see', 'anyone', 'who', 'musicals', 'especially', 'who', 'can', 'barely', 'tolerate', 'One', 'best', 'best.But', 'back', 'Romeo', 'Juliet', 'Shirley', 'Jones', 'Juliet', 'approach', 'role', 'seasoned', 'pro', 'giving', 'usual', 'Robert', 'Preston', 'Romeo', 'realize', 'role', 'alifetime', ""'d"", 'won', 'Tony', 'stage', 'rendition', 'Professor', 'Harold', 'Hill', 'teeth', 'film', 'adaptation', 'superb', 'alacrity', 'often', 'said', 'became', 'hopelessly', 'typecast', 'sunny', 'performance', 'looking', 'up', 'film', 'books', 'be', 'part', 'MUSIC', 'MAN', 'mythology', 'was', 'never', 'work', 'Hermione', 'Gingold', 'Mayor', 'wife', 'best', 'remembered', 'portrayal', 'wicked', 'witch', 'Wizard', 'Oz', 'Paul', 'Ford', 'bumblng', 'best', 'tongue-tied', 'mayor', 'young', 'Ronnie', 'Howard', 'gifts', 'kid', 'who', 'believe', 'Hill', 'ca', ""n't"", 'decide', 'should', 'Many', 'others', 'round', 'powerhouse', 'cast', 'contribute', 'triumphant', 'tale', 'turn', 'century', 'heartland', 'quot', 'Just', 'think', 'quot']",N/A

106629,A1J2931UBBJPXM,0790738074,Reviewer,"[3, 3]","It's early in the Twentieth Century, and there's trouble, my friends, in River City.  Iowa, that is, in this delightful adaptation of Meredith Wilson's long running Broadway musical, ""The Music Man,"" directed by Morton DaCosta and starring Robert Preston as the fast-talking, fleet-footed traveling salesman, Harold Hill.  ""Professor Harold Hill,"" as he calls himself this time around, is in the business of selling band instruments and uniforms, all with the guarantee that he will teach the youngsters of the parents who fork over the cash for his wares how to play.  There's only one problem, and it's the fact that -- as one of his fellow competitors puts it-- ""He don't know one note from another!""  Alas, can it be the con is on?When he jumps train in River City to escape the wrath of an angry gathering of his peers, whom he has ""Given a black eye"" to in the territory, thanks to his dubious business practices, he sets about plying his trade on the good folks of middle America.  But right out of the chute, he runs into some problems:  The Mayor of River City, George Shinn (Paul Ford) wants his credentials, the lovely young local piano teacher and librarian, Marion (Shirley Jones), has her doubts about him, and he lacks an ""angle,"" something to convince the local citizenry of the need for a ""boys band"" to get them out of the trouble they're in-- even if there isn't any until he ""creates"" it.One of his problems is solved when he runs into Marcellus Washburn (Buddy Hackett), a former shill of his, who mentions the new billiard table that just arrived in town.  And that's all the Professor needs; because now they've got trouble, ""With a capital `T' that rhymes with `P' and that stands for `Pool'!""  With that, he's up and running and he's got everything timed, right down to the ""Last wave of the conductor's hand on the last train out of town.""  Yee-gods and great honk!  River City, Iowa, is about to have their very own boy's band.Robert Preston gives the most memorable performance of his career as Hill, the silver-tongued salesman who can palaver past postulated proffered predicaments quicker'n an eggheaded egret's emblematized egression.  It's just a matter of charm, style and timing, and Preston imbues Hill with `em all, and more.  He brings a mesmerizing presence to the screen in this role that is absolutely perfect; Preston IS Harold Hill, and he makes him his own in such a way that it's impossible to visualize anyone else in the role.  It certainly gave Preston a chance to demonstrate his amazing versatility, and he really made the most of it, carving out a niche for himself in cinematic history.The beautiful and talented Shirley Jones is terrific, as well, as ""Marion the Librarian,"" the young woman with a heart of gold who becomes a formidable opponent for Hill as he tries to charm his way past her suspicions of him.  Jones personifies everything that is pure, moral and good, without being prudish, and it makes Marion a truly endearing character.  And, like Preston, her performance is so good it's impossible to picture anyone else in the part.  She's simply magnificent.The made-to-order supporting cast includes a very young Ron Howard, unforgettable as Winthrop Paroo, Marion's little brother, Hermione Gingold (Eulalie Mackechnie Shinn), Pert Kelton (Mrs. Paroo), Monique Vermont (Amaryllis), Susan Luckey (Zaneeta), Timmy Everett (Tommy Djilas), Harry Hickox (Charlie) and Mary Wickes (Mrs. Squires).  Featuring a number of memorable songs, including ""76 Trombones,"" ""Till There Was You,"" ""Gary, Indiana"" and of course the catchy ""Trouble In River City"" number, ""The Music Man"" is an uplifting, totally transporting film that makes the world seem like a pretty good place after all.  This is the ""Good Old Days"" the way we'd like to think they really were, and it's all courtesy of the magic of the movies.",5,"&quot;Well, ya got trouble, my friends--&quot;",994550400,"07 8, 2001",2001,3862,"['early', 'Twentieth', 'Century', 'trouble', 'friends', 'River', 'City', 'Iowa', 'delightful', 'adaptation', 'Meredith', 'Wilson', 'long', 'running', 'Broadway', 'musical', 'Music', 'Man', 'directed', 'Morton', 'DaCosta', 'starring', 'Robert', 'Preston', 'fast-talking', 'fleet-footed', 'traveling', 'salesman', 'Harold', 'Hill', 'Professor', 'Harold', 'Hill', 'time', 'business', 'selling', 'band', 'instruments', 'uniforms', 'guarantee', 'will', 'teach', 'youngsters', 'parents', 'who', 'fork', 'cash', 'wares', 'how', 'play', 'only', 'one', 'problem', 'fact', 'one', 'fellow', 'competitors', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'one', 'note', 'Alas', 'can', 'be', 'con', 'When', 'train', 'River', 'City', 'escape', 'wrath', 'angry', 'gathering', 'peers', 'whom', 'Given', 'black', 'eye', 'territory', 'thanks', 'dubious', 'business', 'practices', 'plying', 'trade', 'good', 'folks', 'middle', 'America', 'right', 'chute', 'problems', 'Mayor', 'River', 'City', 'George', 'Shinn', 'Paul', 'Ford', 'credentials', 'lovely', 'young', 'local', 'piano', 'teacher', 'librarian', 'Marion', 'Shirley', 'Jones', 'doubts', 'angle', 'something', 'convince', 'local', 'citizenry', 'need', 'boys', 'band', 'get', 'trouble', ""'re"", 'even', ""n't"", 'it.One', 'problems', 'solved', 'when', 'Marcellus', 'Washburn', 'Buddy', 'Hackett', 'former', 'shill', 'who', 'new', 'billiard', 'table', 'just', 'arrived', 'town', 'Professor', 'needs', 'because', 'now', ""'ve"", 'got', 'trouble', 'capital', 'T', 'P', 'Pool', 'up', 'running', 'got', 'everything', 'timed', 'right', 'down', 'Last', 'wave', 'conductor', 'hand', 'last', 'train', 'town', 'Yee-gods', 'great', 'honk', 'River', 'City', 'Iowa', 'have', 'very', 'own', 'boy', 'band.Robert', 'Preston', 'most', 'memorable', 'performance', 'career', 'Hill', 'silver-tongued', 'salesman', 'who', 'can', 'palaver', 'past', 'postulated', 'proffered', 'predicaments', 'quicker', 'eggheaded', 'egret', 'emblematized', 'egression', 'just', 'matter', 'charm', 'style', 'timing', 'Preston', 'imbues', 'Hill', 'em', 'more', 'mesmerizing', 'presence', 'screen', 'role', 'absolutely', 'perfect', 'Preston', 'IS', 'Harold', 'Hill', 'own', 'such', 'way', 'impossible', 'visualize', 'anyone', 'else', 'role', 'certainly', 'gave', 'Preston', 'chance', 'demonstrate', 'amazing', 'versatility', 'really', 'made', 'most', 'carving', 'out', 'niche', 'cinematic', 'history.The', 'beautiful', 'talented', 'Shirley', 'Jones', 'terrific', 'as', 'well', 'Marion', 'Librarian', 'young', 'woman', 'heart', 'gold', 'who', 'formidable', 'opponent', 'Hill', 'charm', 'way', 'suspicions', 'Jones', 'personifies', 'everything', 'pure', 'moral', 'good', 'being', 'prudish', 'Marion', 'truly', 'endearing', 'character', 'Preston', 'performance', 'so', 'good', 'impossible', 'picture', 'anyone', 'else', 'part', 'simply', 'magnificent.The', 'made-to-order', 'supporting', 'cast', 'very', 'young', 'Ron', 'Howard', 'unforgettable', 'Winthrop', 'Paroo', 'Marion', 'little', 'brother', 'Hermione', 'Gingold', 'Eulalie', 'Mackechnie', 'Shinn', 'Pert', 'Kelton', 'Mrs.', 'Paroo', 'Monique', 'Vermont', 'Amaryllis', 'Susan', 'Luckey', 'Zaneeta', 'Timmy', 'Everett', 'Tommy', 'Djilas', 'Harry', 'Hickox', 'Charlie', 'Mary', 'Wickes', 'Mrs.', 'Squires', 'Featuring', 'number', 'memorable', 'songs', 'including', '76', 'Trombones', 'Till', 'Was', 'Gary', 'Indiana', 'course', 'catchy', 'Trouble', 'River', 'City', 'number', 'Music', 'Man', 'uplifting', 'totally', 'transporting', 'film', 'world', 'seem', 'pretty', 'good', 'place', 'Good', 'Old', 'Days', 'way', ""'d"", 'like', 'think', 'really', 'were', 'courtesy', 'magic', 'movies']",N/A

106634,A3NBHYYTA1PQJF,0790738074,"Rick ""cpto""","[65, 66]","The previous DVD releases of The Music Man were basically OK in terms of sound, color, brightness, and contrast. But MY! Did they ever mess up the picture with edge enhancement! I don't mean just a little ghost line to the right, but also to the left. At times, the ""enhancement"" made it difficult to make out facial details on a large-screen TV. My guess is that it was transferred using a 19"" monitor from a distance of a couple of feet, where the enhancement wouldn't be as noticeable.Fortunately all this video gunk is corrected in the Blu-Ray edition. The colors are bright, the sound noticeably better, and the movie just comes more alive in blu-ray.But - there always seems to be a flip side. In this case it's noticeable in the opening train scene, where blue matte artifacts around people, and slightly off masking at the windows clearly shows that it was shot against a blue screen. But, what you see is what people saw in the theaters when it was released. If the artifacts didn't bother moviegoers at the time, they shouldn't really bother us in the present. Little glitches like this are just part of the technology available at the time, and shouldn't be used to rate the movie......and I'm really not, just pointing out that seeing more can mean seeing more of the bad, as well as more than the good.Aside from little things like this which caught my eye - and don't really bother me - I hope you'll consider picking up the best release of an old favorite. Improved sound, improved picture - what more could you want. I doubt it'll look better unless George Lucas gets involved in cleaning up the blue-screen artifacts. And who knows what he'd feel like adding!Fun. A couple of hours well spent. And for me, a new appreciation of Hermione Gingold as Ms. Eulalie Shinn. Her looks and voice in ""Pick a little"" really steal the show, as she does in other scenes she's in.It's hard not to enjoy such a high-spirited musical as this, end even harder not to like it in Blu-Ray.

He even looked like Robert Preston and if you close your eyes you would swear it was his voice too.By all means buy this Warner Brothers musical.

106639,A16QODENBJVUI1,0790738074,Robert Moore,"[26, 28]","OK, I have to be honest here:  I don't like &quot;family entertainment.&quot;  If I go to Blockbuster, I usually avoid the Family section entirely for something a bit edgier or darker.  And although I love Fred Astaire and most Gene Kelly, I am not at all a fan of Hollywood musicals from the fifties and early sixties, when they were becoming more &quot;epic&quot; as the movies tried to provide something that television could not.Nonetheless, I find THE MUSIC MAN to be one of the most thoroughly enjoyable pieces of light entertainment ever.  Primarily there are two reasons for this.  First, there is the great score, the most famous tune notwithstanding (maybe I have heard it too often, but &quot;Seventy-Six Trombones&quot; really leaves me cold).  But nearly every other song is utterly delightful, especially the magnificent &quot;Till There Was You.&quot;  Am I a dork if I confess that I love the barbershop quartet numbers (I was second tenor in a high school quartet)?  But as fine as the score is, take away Robert Preston and you have at best an average, forgettable film.  Preston today is remembered almost exclusively for his role as Professor Harold Hill, which is a reflection not so much on his prior career as on the extraordinary job he did in performing this role.  There is a similar parallel with Rex Harrison, who despite a long career on stage and screen, is primarily remembered for MY FAIR LADY.  Interestingly, in both MY FAIR LADY and THE MUSIC MAN, other actors were considered for the lead role, although both Preston and Harrison created the roles for Broadway.  Interestingly, Cary Grant was considered for both films (though Grant very famously responded that he wouldn't star in the film and if Preston weren't cast in the lead, he wouldn't even go see it), though Warners first choice was Frank Sinatra.  Luckily, things worked out, and Robert Preston &quot;owns&quot; the role of Professor Harold Hill like few actors own a role.The film is also helped by a rich supporting cast.  Shirley Jones was her usual excellent self in the film (though it is well known that she was pregnant during the shooting), and the film provided the late Buddy Hackett with one of his finest screen roles.  Paul Ford, best known as the colonel on the Phil Silvers Show, turns in a nice screen performance as the Mayor.  Hermione Gingold, who spent most of her career on stage and had as a result a surprisingly small screen career, excels as the mayor's wife and the leading light for culture in the town.But mainly, this is a great, great vehicle for a great leading man who has utterly nailed a great role.  If Frank Sinatra or Cary Grant had been enticed to play the lead, perhaps we would still be watching this film today, but for some reason I am sceptical.  But I am certain that this is one family film that all but the hardest of hearts will enjoy.",5,A family musical even a curmudgeon can love,1070150400,"11 30, 2003",2003,2879,"['OK', 'have', 'be', 'honest', 'here', 'do', ""n't"", 'like', 'quot', 'family', 'entertainment.', 'quot', 'go', 'Blockbuster', 'usually', 'avoid', 'Family', 'section', 'entirely', 'something', 'bit', 'edgier', 'darker', 'love', 'Fred', 'Astaire', 'most', 'Gene', 'Kelly', 'am', 'not', 'fan', 'Hollywood', 'musicals', 'fifties', 'early', 'sixties', 'when', 'were', 'becoming', 'more', 'quot', 'quot', 'movies', 'tried', 'provide', 'something', 'television', 'could', 'not.Nonetheless', 'find', 'THE', 'MUSIC', 'MAN', 'be', 'one', 'most', 'thoroughly', 'enjoyable', 'pieces', 'light', 'entertainment', 'ever', 'Primarily', 'are', 'two', 'reasons', 'First', 'great', 'score', 'most', 'famous', 'tune', 'notwithstanding', 'maybe', 'have', 'heard', 'too', 'often', 'quot', 'Seventy-Six', 'Trombones', 'quot', 'really', 'cold', 'nearly', 'other', 'song', 'utterly', 'delightful', 'especially', 'magnificent', 'quot', 'Till', 'Was', 'You.', 'quot', 'Am', 'dork', 'confess', 'love', 'barbershop', 'quartet', 'numbers', 'was', 'second', 'tenor', 'high', 'school', 'quartet', 'as', 'fine', 'score', 'take', 'away', 'Robert', 'Preston', 'have', 'best', 'average', 'forgettable', 'film', 'Preston', 'today', 'remembered', 'almost', 'exclusively', 'role', 'Professor', 'Harold', 'Hill', 'reflection', 'not', 'so', 'much', 'prior', 'career', 'extraordinary', 'job', 'did', 'performing', 'role', 'similar', 'parallel', 'Rex', 'Harrison', 'who', 'long', 'career', 'stage', 'screen', 'primarily', 'remembered', 'MY', 'FAIR', 'LADY', 'Interestingly', 'MY', 'FAIR', 'LADY', 'THE', 'MUSIC', 'MAN', 'other', 'actors', 'were', 'considered', 'lead', 'role', 'Preston', 'Harrison', 'created', 'roles', 'Broadway', 'Interestingly', 'Cary', 'Grant', 'was', 'considered', 'films', 'Grant', 'very', 'famously', 'responded', 'would', ""n't"", 'star', 'film', 'Preston', 'were', ""n't"", 'cast', 'lead', 'would', ""n't"", 'even', 'go', 'see', 'Warners', 'first', 'choice', 'was', 'Frank', 'Sinatra', 'Luckily', 'things', 'worked', 'out', 'Robert', 'Preston', 'quot', 'quot', 'role', 'Professor', 'Harold', 'Hill', 'few', 'actors', 'own', 'role.The', 'film', 'also', 'helped', 'rich', 'supporting', 'cast', 'Shirley', 'Jones', 'was', 'usual', 'excellent', 'self', 'film', 'well', 'known', 'was', 'pregnant', 'shooting', 'film', 'provided', 'late', 'Buddy', 'Hackett', 'one', 'finest', 'screen', 'roles', 'Paul', 'Ford', 'best', 'known', 'colonel', 'Phil', 'Silvers', 'Show', 'nice', 'screen', 'performance', 'Mayor', 'Hermione', 'Gingold', 'who', 'spent', 'most', 'career', 'stage', 'had', 'result', 'surprisingly', 'small', 'screen', 'career', 'mayor', 'wife', 'leading', 'light', 'culture', 'town.But', 'mainly', 'great', 'great', 'vehicle', 'great', 'leading', 'man', 'who', 'utterly', 'nailed', 'great', 'role', 'Frank', 'Sinatra', 'Cary', 'Grant', 'had', 'been', 'enticed', 'play', 'lead', 'perhaps', 'would', 'still', 'be', 'watching', 'film', 'today', 'reason', 'am', 'sceptical', 'am', 'certain', 'one', 'family', 'film', 'hardest', 'hearts', 'will', 'enjoy']",N/A

106645,A2G935GMRAUIRW,0790738074,Sandy McLendon,"[4, 7]","There is such a wealth of kind reviews here on 'The Music Man', I almost didn't bother adding my own, until I realised that not one manages to  convey how terrific Shirley Jones is in this movie.  Never content to be  just a musical star, Jones has always stretched her acting wings, as  evidenced by her Oscar for her portrayal of a prostitute in 'Elmer Gantry'.  Marian Paroo in 'The Music Man' is light-years removed from that role, but  Shirley Jones proves, once again, that she's an actress.  Productions of  'Music Man' rise and fall on the performance of the actress playing Marian;  the role is incredibly difficult.  It calls for the performer to make very  fast transitions from starchiness to tremulous love-making- and Marian is  called on not only to love Professor Hill, but to communicate to an  audience WHY he's worth it.  Shirley Jones tosses all this off so  effortlessly that many people think she's not doing much- they're wrong!  The full range of her talents gets a workout here; she sings, dances, has  comedy bits (her scene 'vamping' an anvil salesman is a howler), and can  hold a Technicolour close-up like nobody has in years.  The most delightful  part of her work, for my money, comes in the 'Marian the Librarian' number,  where Marian's library is invaded (and its sanctity destroyed) by a visit  from Harold Hill.  Shirley's laser precision and split-second timing are a  delight to watch; it's especially impressive when you stop to think that  she's not primarily known as a dancer.As wonderful as Shirley Jones is,  'The Music Man' is not without flaws.  Director Morton Da Costa elicted  marvellous performances from his stars, but he seems not to have cared so  much about what the minor players did.  Many of the child actors are way  too hammy; one gets the impression of hordes of stage mommas off-camera  yelling, 'SING OUT, LOUISE!', and 'SMILE, BABY!'.  Monique Vermont as  Amaryllis is especially annoying; someone should have sent her home until  she cut out at least 90 percent of her cutesy-poo schtick.  Fortunately for  the movie, 'The Music Man' has Ron Howard as Winthrop Paroo; his  performance is a little miracle of naturalness.  Da Costa also has trouble  with basic movie POV issues; there's a bad POV switch right in the middle  of 'Shipoopi'.  In the same number, Da Costa ignores another basic rule of  movie-making when Robert Preston is supposed to grab a couple of women and  dance with them before grabbing Shirley Jones to finish the number with  her.  The first dancer he grabs is nearly a dead ringer for Jones, and  since the audience is expecting him to find Jones and dance with her in the  scene, it's confusing to see Preston abandon this dancer and go on to  another.  It's a silly, irritating mistake to see in such a great  number.No matter what nits I pick, though, 'The Music Man' still has a  great story, great cast, and of course, Shirley.  By the way, there has  been a controversy for decades about who was the better Marian Paroo-  Shirley or Barbara Cook, who originated the role on Broadway.  My vote,  based on a comparison of the Broadway original cast album with Cook, and  the movie soundtrack with Jones, goes squarely to Shirley.  Barbara Cook  sings every number as beautifully as only she knows how, and it is  absolutely thrilling.  But Shirley Jones does more- she uses her  musicianship to enhance her acting.  In the early songs, Jones keeps her  voice 'cold' and correct, sticking strictly to the notes Meredith Willson  wrote, as befits a straitlaced librarian.  Later, when Marian's passions  emerge, Jones unleashes a much lusher, more romantic voice- and it's that  much clearer that the lady is in love.Enough from me.

Julie Andrews lost ""My Fair Lady"" to Audrey Hepburn,  Lucille Ball was chosen over Angela Lansbury for ""Mame,"" and Rosalind Russell got the role of Mama Rose in ""Gypsy"" instead of powerhouse Ethel Merman.  Occasionally, however, studio executives make intelligent casting choices when adapting a Broadway musical, as in ""The Music Man.""""The Music Man"" stars Robert Preston, from the original Broadway production, as con man Harold Hill.  ""Professor"" Hill sweeps into River City, Iowa, to form a boys' band, to the disapproval and later delight of the town librarian, Marian (Shirley Jones).  Preston created his signature role of the charming stranger who stirs up a sleepy town.  He transforms town skeptics into enthusiastic cheerleaders when he talk/sings ""Ya Got Trouble,"" noting the evils of ragtime, slang, and young men frittering away their time playing pool.Composer Meredith Willson based ""The Music Man"" on his own small-town Midwestern boyhood, around 1912.  The score includes the standards ""76 Trombones,"" ""Till There Was You,"" ""My White Night,"" and ""Goodnight, My Someone.""  The cast includes Buddy Hackett, Hermione Gingold, Paul Ford, and seven-year-old Ronnie Howard, who lisps his way through the tune, ""Gary, Indiana.""Opening on Broadway during its Golden Age of Musicals, ""The Music Man"" is an old-fashioned show, rich with comedy and melody, touching lightly on social commentary.  Preston makes his charlatan charismatic with fast talk, razzmatazz, ""think system"" of music education, and ability to make stodgy skeptics believe in the boys band.  Hill is larger than life -- a lovable scoundrel who is ultimately tamed by the lovely spinster Marian.  The movie is an enjoyable record of Preston's fiery, funny interpretation of musical comedy's foremost con man.

That decade meant it could be filmed in a new TODD-AO widescreen process that was of course not available prior. And as anyone who has watched the film will tell you, much of the films beauty comes from its widescreen images. What many are not aware of is the fact that films shot in TODD-AO were not compatible with regular CinemaScope so each film was shot twice! If you were to watch The CinemaScope version next to The TODD-AO version you'd see two unique performances with different timing on edits as well as running time. The better quality transfer comes from The TODD-AO master but it seems the performances were a little better on The CinemaScope... No matter which process they used, the cameras incorporated were huge bulky things, which were a nuisance to move.

This film is simply irresistable!  The music, the performances -all first rate and perfect casting throughout, the gorgeous color cinematography, the costumes, the production design.  I could go on and on.  If you've never seen this film or only seen it in pan and scan television broadcasts, you owe it to yourself to see this gem!  Everyone agrees that Robert Preston was born to play this part.  LIke Rex Harrison in ""My Fair Lady"", it is difficult to imagine anyone else in the role.  Shirley Jones is absolutely stunning!  She has never looked lovelier.  Her voice is a miracle.  I place her voice in the top five greatest female voices of all time.

I sing allong to the soundtrack at least once a week, and I still can't get enough of it.What makes me love the musical so much is that the music and the settings make me feel like I really am in &quot;IOWAY&quot;.  I see Professor Harold Hills all over the place in real life, and this play shows you that they can be human beings and have anima (soul).  Robert Preston was born to do this role.  It is a true shame that after the fame he achieved on the stage and in this film of The Music Man, he did not recieve as much fame in his later movies.  It's hard to believe that he was a common secondary actor in westerns and had never used his singing capabilities before The Music Man.I know of many well- educated Marian Librarians who need Professors like Harold to show them that they are special and better than any other kind of company.  When Sirley Jones sings &quot;And if ocassionaly he'd ponder, what makes Shakespeare and Beetoven great, him I could love till I died.&quot;  My liberal arts mind melts into putty.The movie never looses the touch that the original cast had to the play.  The reason is because the director, Da Costa, was the director of the play on Broadway as well as the film.  The scenes and lighting move allong in the film as they would on a stage.  Most of the scenes, for example, are concluded by a shillouette light on a main character that fades.  The choreography of the dance scenes are spectacular, and very well constructed, like you would expect them to be on a stage.The DVD comes with a lot of great extra material.  Shirley Jones is the narrator of two doccumentaries.  Much behind the scenes infromation is unvieled in these doccumentaries.  A feature that I use a lot is the English subtitles, which are placed in the black part of the screen so you can easilly sing allong to the wide array of songs.  There are the usual talent files, original trailers, and more.  For any fan of musicals, the doccumentaries are a treat all by themselves.I have not focused  a lot on the story of the movie, because I suspect you have already seen this classic film or have heard of the play.  If you have not seen or heard of the play, I won't tell you the story anyway, you have to see it for yourself.  Believe me, it's worth it.
