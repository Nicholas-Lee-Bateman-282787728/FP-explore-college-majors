Willie is Willie, from the time I first became a fan,the summer of 1972 to today, Willie is always ""at his prime"".

Willie changed up his vocals enough so everything sounded fresh and new.As always, his guitar playing was admirable.The concert is a little short, with a running time of just 59 minutes. But hey, I could listen to Willie sing all night long!Despite my Wille Greed, and wanting the concert to last a little longer, this was a terrific way to hear a lot of old favorites from Willie.There are 17 songs on the DVD including:Whiskey RiverStay a Little LongerBlue Eyes Crying in the RainBloody Mary MorningEtc., Etc.It's a keeper that will make any Willie Nelson fan happy.",5,"Stay All Night, Stay a Little Longer",1240185600,"04 20, 2009",2009,730,"['always', 'great', 'hear', 'Willie', 'sing', 'classics', 'never', 'really', 'sings', 'same', 'way', 'twice', 'how', 'was', 'great', 'concert', 'Austin', 'Willie', 'changed', 'up', 'vocals', 'enough', 'so', 'everything', 'sounded', 'fresh', 'new.As', 'always', 'guitar', 'playing', 'was', 'admirable.The', 'concert', 'little', 'short', 'running', 'time', 'just', '59', 'minutes', 'hey', 'could', 'listen', 'Willie', 'sing', 'night', 'long', 'Wille', 'Greed', 'wanting', 'concert', 'last', 'little', 'longer', 'was', 'terrific', 'way', 'hear', 'lot', 'old', 'favorites', 'Willie.There', 'are', '17', 'songs', 'DVD', 'including', 'Whiskey', 'RiverStay', 'Little', 'LongerBlue', 'Eyes', 'Crying', 'RainBloody', 'Mary', 'MorningEtc.', 'Etc.It', 'keeper', 'will', 'make', 'Willie', 'Nelson', 'fan', 'happy']",N/A
