This one just didn't quite deliver which saddened me really because I really wanted to love it. First off, I had trouble believing anyone of any faith was that superstitious that they would let some ""deal"" made with god keep them from someone they loved so deeply. That's a small god that can be bargained with so easily, makes you wonder why anyone would serve such a god. So that's my first gripe. Second, I just never connected with Katrina Kaif. She's pretty enough but her character, or maybe her acting, was flat and left me disbelieving this ""amazing"" connection that sent a man off to try and die to prove her and her ""god"" wrong. Thirdly, hard to say this because I adore SRK, and he did a great job but Anushka Sharma stole the show! I was rooting for her! I wanted HER to get the man. Akira was so vibrant and effervescent while Meera was so colorless, flat, and silly with her superstitious deals with god, seemed an obvious choice to me! Who wants a colorless mouse when you can have a beautiful butterfly? I was also able to look at my husband and predict several plot twists but that isn't uncommon so I won't harp on that one too much. It's an okay movie, I still enjoyed SRK, always do, I'm a huge fan, and especially Anushka, it was nice to see them on screen together again. It just left me feeling almost as flat as Meera came across on screen.",3,Didn't really deliver.,1359158400,"01 26, 2013",2013,1436,"['love', 'SRK', 'generally', 'speaking', 'love', 'Yash', 'Chopra', 'romantic', 'comedies', 'one', 'just', 'did', ""n't"", 'quite', 'deliver', 'saddened', 'really', 'really', 'wanted', 'love', 'First', 'had', 'trouble', 'believing', 'anyone', 'faith', 'was', 'superstitious', 'would', 'let', 'deal', 'made', 'god', 'keep', 'someone', 'loved', 'so', 'deeply', 'small', 'god', 'can', 'be', 'bargained', 'so', 'easily', 'wonder', 'why', 'anyone', 'would', 'serve', 'such', 'god', 'first', 'gripe', 'Second', 'just', 'never', 'connected', 'Katrina', 'Kaif', 'pretty', 'enough', 'character', 'maybe', 'acting', 'was', 'flat', 'left', 'disbelieving', 'amazing', 'connection', 'sent', 'man', 'try', 'die', 'prove', 'god', 'wrong', 'Thirdly', 'hard', 'say', 'adore', 'SRK', 'did', 'great', 'job', 'Anushka', 'Sharma', 'stole', 'show', 'was', 'rooting', 'wanted', 'HER', 'get', 'man', 'Akira', 'was', 'so', 'vibrant', 'effervescent', 'Meera', 'was', 'so', 'colorless', 'flat', 'silly', 'superstitious', 'deals', 'god', 'seemed', 'obvious', 'choice', 'Who', 'colorless', 'mouse', 'when', 'can', 'have', 'beautiful', 'butterfly', 'was', 'also', 'able', 'look', 'husband', 'predict', 'several', 'plot', 'twists', ""n't"", 'uncommon', 'wo', ""n't"", 'harp', 'one', 'too', 'much', 'okay', 'movie', 'still', 'enjoyed', 'SRK', 'always', 'do', ""'m"", 'huge', 'fan', 'especially', 'Anushka', 'was', 'nice', 'see', 'screen', 'together', 'again', 'just', 'left', 'feeling', 'almost', 'as', 'flat', 'Meera', 'came', 'screen']",N/A

Its also becomes a tragedy  because sadly enough, he passes away before the before the release of the film. Those are enough reasons to see the film. JTHJ is some of the old stuff in a new bottle- it is long 180 minutes but has many moments to keep you engaged throughout the film. As I said, this is old stuff but star power, cinematography and direction keep you hooked. I felt this was the tale of Meerabai adapted to modern sensibilities- the Meerabai (Katrina Kaif) is caught between her faith in Christ and love for a musician ( SRK). This story has its minor flaws and unfortunately hamper the film in places but has many strengths too.Akira ( Anushka Sharma, a possibility that she will be a superstar soon) is doing an investigative piece on Explosive disposal experts when she stumbles on Samar ( SRK) and starts making a documentary on him. Through his diary and flashbacks we learn about his past and his carefree says on the streets of London, his meeting with Meera ( Katrina Kaif) and his lost love. However Samr is a bitter, loner today and while working on the documentary  Akira starts gravitating towards him and eventually even Samar starts reciprocating.  But fate has other plans.....JTHJ is a decent, one time entertainer and is a tribute to a legend even though it is not one of his best works. The film is great but one is bound to be disappointed not because this is a mediocre film but just because expectations are manifold from a Yash Raj film- a strong reason for people to be disappointed.I felt that although the movie was just ordinary but watchable- I was  extremely troubled by the quality of the movie soundtrack- when Yash Raj, AR Rahman and Gulzar announced their collaboration on their soundtrack- I had heavenly aspirations but the end result was poor. One of the weakest soundtracks of a Yash Chopra film.  My personal favorite was Heer Heer, the poem JTHJ and the best song - the title track at the end of the film set to the legend director directing his cast during the making of the film.Anil Mehta captures the beauty and barrenness of Ladakh with his cinematography.The leads are all amazing SRK, as usual great ( Can you give us more films like Darr, Chak de India and Om Shanti Om), he balances the youth and the middle aged progression of his act very well.  Anushka Sharma and Katrina Kaif are both great as well.The cameo piece of Rishi Kapoor and Neetu Singh is well integrated. The end of the film is weak and I felt something was missing in the last few scenes. One could only hope that JTHJ could have been the finest movie of Yash Chopra's career but this is because we have so many expectations out of his films. Watch this film as a tribute to one of the greatest film directors of all time....four stars. 1/29/2012",4,Yash Chopra- The man who cannot die,1360368000,"02 9, 2013",2013,3069,"['films', 'such', 'Waqt', 'Ittefaq', 'Daag', 'Deewar', 'Kabhie', 'Kabhie', 'Trishul', 'Chandni', 'Darr-', 'movies', 'have', 'redefined', 'face', 'Indian', 'Cinema', 'Yash', 'Chopra', 'film', 'major', 'event', 'ca', ""n't"", 'be', 'missed', 'especially', 'director', 'announcement', 'going', 'be', 'final', 'movie', 'also', 'tragedy', 'sadly', 'enough', 'away', 'release', 'film', 'are', 'enough', 'reasons', 'see', 'film', 'JTHJ', 'old', 'stuff', 'new', 'bottle-', 'long', '180', 'minutes', 'many', 'moments', 'keep', 'engaged', 'film', 'said', 'old', 'stuff', 'star', 'power', 'cinematography', 'direction', 'keep', 'hooked', 'felt', 'was', 'tale', 'Meerabai', 'adapted', 'modern', 'sensibilities-', 'Meerabai', 'Katrina', 'Kaif', 'caught', 'faith', 'Christ', 'love', 'musician', 'SRK', 'story', 'minor', 'flaws', 'unfortunately', 'hamper', 'film', 'places', 'many', 'strengths', 'too.Akira', 'Anushka', 'Sharma', 'possibility', 'will', 'be', 'superstar', 'soon', 'doing', 'investigative', 'piece', 'Explosive', 'disposal', 'experts', 'when', 'Samar', 'SRK', 'making', 'documentary', 'diary', 'learn', 'past', 'carefree', 'streets', 'London', 'meeting', 'Meera', 'Katrina', 'Kaif', 'lost', 'love', 'However', 'Samr', 'bitter', 'loner', 'today', 'working', 'documentary', 'Akira', 'gravitating', 'towards', 'eventually', 'even', 'Samar', 'reciprocating', 'fate', 'other', 'plans', '..JTHJ', 'decent', 'one', 'time', 'entertainer', 'tribute', 'legend', 'even', 'not', 'one', 'best', 'works', 'film', 'great', 'one', 'bound', 'be', 'disappointed', 'not', 'mediocre', 'film', 'just', 'expectations', 'are', 'manifold', 'Yash', 'Raj', 'film-', 'strong', 'reason', 'people', 'be', 'disappointed.I', 'felt', 'movie', 'was', 'just', 'ordinary', 'watchable-', 'was', 'extremely', 'troubled', 'quality', 'movie', 'soundtrack-', 'when', 'Yash', 'Raj', 'AR', 'Rahman', 'Gulzar', 'announced', 'collaboration', 'soundtrack-', 'had', 'heavenly', 'aspirations', 'end', 'result', 'was', 'poor', 'One', 'weakest', 'soundtracks', 'Yash', 'Chopra', 'film', 'personal', 'favorite', 'was', 'Heer', 'Heer', 'poem', 'JTHJ', 'best', 'song', 'title', 'track', 'end', 'film', 'set', 'legend', 'director', 'directing', 'cast', 'making', 'film.Anil', 'Mehta', 'beauty', 'barrenness', 'Ladakh', 'cinematography.The', 'leads', 'are', 'amazing', 'SRK', 'usual', 'great', 'Can', 'give', 'more', 'films', 'Darr', 'Chak', 'India', 'Om', 'Shanti', 'Om', 'youth', 'middle', 'aged', 'progression', 'act', 'very', 'well', 'Anushka', 'Sharma', 'Katrina', 'Kaif', 'are', 'great', 'well.The', 'cameo', 'piece', 'Rishi', 'Kapoor', 'Neetu', 'Singh', 'well', 'integrated', 'end', 'film', 'weak', 'felt', 'something', 'was', 'missing', 'last', 'few', 'scenes', 'One', 'could', 'only', 'hope', 'JTHJ', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'finest', 'movie', 'Yash', 'Chopra', 'career', 'have', 'so', 'many', 'expectations', 'films', 'Watch', 'film', 'tribute', 'one', 'greatest', 'film', 'directors', 'time', '.four', 'stars', '1/29/2012']",N/A

1616650,AJ83VFEY0MYLM,B00ATCDFQU,"Ashley L. Oldaker ""SRK all the way""","[0, 0]","This is one of those movies that after viewing you have to just sit and let your mind and heart digest everything you've just seen. This movie has some of the most visually stunning scenes, like the scene where Samar is walking Meera home after they made a promise at a church to never cross the line. Heer is playing (which is a gorgeous folk song sung in a calm, dreamy manner) and it's night with a light snow falling and Samar slowly turns away and the pure snow lands in the waves of Samar's lush black hair and he has a mixture of longing, sadness, and anger in his gaze. It moved me to tears. I love Shah Rukh's character Samar. He was working several jobs and didn't have that much going for him but had a beautiful outlook and a lot of energy and optimism. I don't care for Katrina's character Meera. I feel a coldness from her the whole film and she doesn't love Samar with the intensity that he loves her. She is rich and acts it, has a negative perspective and thinks she can make even God give her everything she wants. Her reasoning for shattering Samar's heart and staying out of his life does not make sense to anyone but her. Anuska's Akira, although much younger and a little too hyper, was a much better match for Samar and by that time in his life, brought back some of the positivity and energy he used to have, pre-Meera. The dance scene with Samar and Meera at the tunnel was amazing, forceful, and athletic. The physical intensity was captivating. Shah Rukh always says in interviews that he's not a good dancer but he must just mean learning the steps comes easier to other actors than him, because once he starts dancing onscreen you forget there are other actors. The scene at the London underground &#34;tube&#34; where Samar asks Meera &#34;If I kiss you, will you slap me?&#34; makes your heart feel like it's slipping. And they actually kiss on the mouth, which I've never seen Shah Rukh do, and that strange noise-music in the background that makes you nervous. It was very unexpected and sexier than any kissing scene I've ever seen, while still being tasteful and classier than Hollywood. There was definitely more chemistry and sexual tension between Samar and Meera than Samar and Akira but that's not necessarily what makes a good, working relationship. Even being a romantic, in real life I don't see Samar and Meera's relationship working. How often does happy, outgoing, hardworking, financially struggling immigrant meet rich, stubborn, snotty girl, they have nothing in common and they live happily ever after. Despite not liking Meera's personality, I love the movie. It felt like a very grown up role for Shah Rukh, if you've seen most of his movies you know what I mean. He gave a believable, real, yet enchanting dual performance. After the break up with Meera, even his posture seemed different. He was rigid and high strung, and walked and moved with muscles tight in a mechanical manner. His idealism had drained away and he was a man with an emotional wound so deep it was taking over his whole body. I imagine this would be a hard quality to portray realistically in a movie. While being overall a serious, emotional, moving story, it has funny and very charming moments in it. Like the scene when Samar is helping Meera hand out food at a soup kitchen and he's saying to each person &#34;Bon-apptight&#34; and keeping his room mate awake practicing the English pronunciation of salmon in the bathtub. There's a scene where Samar is sleeping with his mouth open, Meera gently closes it and he wakes up with this genuinely blissful smile. I can't say enough how impressed I am with Shah Rukh's performance in this. In life he seems like a very energetic, dramatic person and this shows in all his films, but then this film and My Name is Khan are such quiet, subtle performances that it looks almost effortless. This was Yash Chopra's last love letter to our world and he made it such a lovelier place to be.",5,Stunning!,1389225600,"01 9, 2014",2014,3958,"['one', 'movies', 'viewing', 'have', 'just', 'sit', 'let', 'mind', 'heart', 'digest', 'everything', ""'ve"", 'just', 'seen', 'movie', 'most', 'visually', 'stunning', 'scenes', 'scene', 'where', 'Samar', 'walking', 'Meera', 'home', 'made', 'promise', 'church', 'never', 'cross', 'line', 'Heer', 'playing', 'gorgeous', 'folk', 'song', 'sung', 'calm', 'dreamy', 'manner', 'night', 'light', 'snow', 'falling', 'Samar', 'slowly', 'away', 'pure', 'snow', 'waves', 'Samar', 'lush', 'black', 'hair', 'mixture', 'longing', 'sadness', 'anger', 'gaze', 'moved', 'tears', 'love', 'Shah', 'Rukh', 'character', 'Samar', 'was', 'working', 'several', 'jobs', 'did', ""n't"", 'have', 'much', 'going', 'had', 'beautiful', 'outlook', 'lot', 'energy', 'optimism', 'do', ""n't"", 'care', 'Katrina', 'character', 'Meera', 'feel', 'coldness', 'whole', 'film', ""n't"", 'love', 'Samar', 'intensity', 'rich', 'negative', 'perspective', 'can', 'make', 'even', 'God', 'give', 'everything', 'reasoning', 'shattering', 'Samar', 'heart', 'staying', 'life', 'not', 'make', 'sense', 'anyone', 'Anuska', 'Akira', 'much', 'younger', 'little', 'too', 'hyper', 'was', 'much', 'better', 'match', 'Samar', 'time', 'life', 'brought', 'back', 'positivity', 'energy', 'used', 'have', 'pre-Meera', 'dance', 'scene', 'Samar', 'Meera', 'tunnel', 'was', 'amazing', 'forceful', 'athletic', 'physical', 'intensity', 'was', 'captivating', 'Shah', 'Rukh', 'always', 'interviews', 'not', 'good', 'dancer', 'must', 'just', 'mean', 'learning', 'steps', 'easier', 'other', 'actors', 'because', 'dancing', 'forget', 'are', 'other', 'actors', 'scene', 'London', 'underground', '34', 'tube', '34', 'where', 'Samar', 'Meera', '34', 'kiss', 'will', 'slap', '34', 'heart', 'feel', 'slipping', 'actually', 'kiss', 'mouth', ""'ve"", 'never', 'seen', 'Shah', 'Rukh', 'do', 'strange', 'noise-music', 'background', 'nervous', 'was', 'very', 'unexpected', 'sexier', 'kissing', 'scene', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'seen', 'still', 'being', 'tasteful', 'classier', 'Hollywood', 'was', 'definitely', 'more', 'chemistry', 'sexual', 'tension', 'Samar', 'Meera', 'Samar', 'Akira', 'not', 'necessarily', 'what', 'good', 'working', 'relationship', 'Even', 'being', 'romantic', 'real', 'life', 'do', ""n't"", 'see', 'Samar', 'Meera', 'relationship', 'working', 'How', 'often', 'happy', 'outgoing', 'hardworking', 'financially', 'struggling', 'immigrant', 'meet', 'rich', 'stubborn', 'snotty', 'girl', 'have', 'nothing', 'common', 'live', 'happily', 'ever', 'not', 'liking', 'Meera', 'personality', 'love', 'movie', 'felt', 'very', 'grown', 'up', 'role', 'Shah', 'Rukh', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'most', 'movies', 'know', 'what', 'mean', 'gave', 'believable', 'real', 'yet', 'enchanting', 'dual', 'performance', 'break', 'up', 'Meera', 'even', 'posture', 'seemed', 'different', 'was', 'rigid', 'high', 'strung', 'walked', 'moved', 'muscles', 'tight', 'mechanical', 'manner', 'idealism', 'had', 'drained', 'away', 'was', 'man', 'emotional', 'wound', 'so', 'deep', 'was', 'taking', 'over', 'whole', 'body', 'imagine', 'would', 'be', 'hard', 'quality', 'portray', 'realistically', 'movie', 'being', 'overall', 'serious', 'emotional', 'moving', 'story', 'funny', 'very', 'charming', 'moments', 'scene', 'when', 'Samar', 'helping', 'Meera', 'hand', 'out', 'food', 'soup', 'kitchen', 'saying', 'person', '34', 'Bon-apptight', '34', 'keeping', 'room', 'mate', 'awake', 'practicing', 'English', 'pronunciation', 'salmon', 'bathtub', 'scene', 'where', 'Samar', 'sleeping', 'mouth', 'open', 'Meera', 'gently', 'up', 'genuinely', 'blissful', 'smile', 'ca', ""n't"", 'say', 'enough', 'how', 'impressed', 'am', 'Shah', 'Rukh', 'performance', 'life', 'very', 'energetic', 'dramatic', 'person', 'films', 'then', 'film', 'My', 'Name', 'Khan', 'are', 'such', 'quiet', 'subtle', 'performances', 'almost', 'effortless', 'was', 'Yash', 'Chopra', 'last', 'love', 'letter', 'world', 'made', 'lovelier', 'place', 'be']",N/A
1616651,A3VI8KO303141L,B00ATCDFQU,bekagoose,"[26, 30]","A beautiful last love story created by the great Yash Chopra. The story portrays the wonderfulness of being in love along with the difficulties that are caused by it. In the first half of the story, Samar (Shahrukh Khan), is shown as a happy-go-lucky kind of guy, who has a lot of energy, and says what he thinks. Then he meets Meera (the Yash Chopra heroine), a daddy's girl who is about to marry a man she doesn't truely love. Meera is a woman who is refined and has a lot of self-control and makes baragins with God in order to get what she wants, along with this she also has walls built around her (why?... you'll have to watch). We only see these walls come down and the true Meera emerge when she is with Samar. But she has made a promise to God to marry the man her father wants her too, and when an accident happens to Samar, she believes it is her fault for going against her promise to God. Therefore, she promises that if he lives she will never meet him again. Samar lives and she tells him that she will no longer see him and will marry her fiance. In that instant we see Samar change to a cold man as his love walks out the door, he then tells God that he will put himself in danger every day in order to prove to Meera her baragin won't suffice to keep him alive. It is truely painful to see Samar walk out of the church with a stone cold look on his face, knowing that his love broke his heart and he will spend his life without her.In the second half, ten years later, we see Samar has become a bomb defuser for the Indian Army. This is where Akira enters. A spirited girl, and very modern in her thinking of how relationships should work. She is a tom-boy who loves to have fun and is very intrigued by Samar, who she is following for a documentary that could make her career. She is interested in this hardened man who puts his life in danger. While with him she falls in love with him, I think it's because he is a broken man and she wants to put him together again, which is nothing she has felt with a man before, and she seems determined to make him forget about Meera.And then comes the dilemma, Samar meets with another accident and loses his memory. The only thing he remembers is being with Meera, and does not recognize Akira, and continues to ask for Meera. I admire Akira for taking it upon herself to unite the two even though she loves him. She finds Meera and brings her to the hospital to see Samar, which the doctors believe will help him remember the past ten years. My favorite scene is when Samar and Meera meet after such a long time, it is so beautiful and sweet how they hug each other and you can see Meera allow herself a bit of happieness of being with him again. Samar is told that he is suffering from amnesia and what he remembers is from ten years ago. Because of this he believes that he and Meera have been together the entire time, and Meera plays along. The doctor tells her it will help him adjust and maybe remember but I think she truely does it because her love for him never ended, and this is a chance to be with him. Even though we can she her restrain herself when it comes to truely letting herself be with him there are moments in their time together that we see her allow herself the luxury of being with him. Eventually, Samar gets his memory back, in an unlikely event that I could have done without but it's a movie and reality should be left at the door anyways. He confronts Meera for making a mockery of his love for her by leading him on, and he leaves her crying in the same church where her baragins were made, and where the war began between Samar and God. I won't tell the ending but if you know Yash Chopra you can assume how the movie ends.I think it is interesting that God is believed to be the obstacle in the way of Samar and Meera being together, but in reality Meera is the obstacle to their happily ever after. Her utter belif that she keeps her promises to God is both admirable and stupid as we become frustrated with her inability to realize God never intended for them to be apart. The story of Samar and Meera becomes a testament to Akira that true love exists, and modern views on relationships may be incorrect.Now onto performances. Of course Shahrukh did wonderful as the happy guy bouncing from job to job, but he also did a wonderful job as the hardened man wary of letting people in. He is an actor who can really portray love, and does so in little nuances, such as a hand on a cheek, or a kiss on the forhead, he has it down. His chemistry with Katrina Kaif is very nice, and helps make the story believable. For this being Katrina Kaif's first serious romantic film I think she did great. She did a believable job portraying a self-restrained, and strong woman, who allows a man to come a sweep her off her feet. Some critics panned her performance for being to cold and ridged in spots, but I think this is how Yashji wanted it to be. She is loose and goofy only with Samar and restrained the other times, when she is reunited with Samar, I think she is supposed to show some coldness so that she can protect herself. The character Meera belongs to Kaif and she did a wonderful job portraying her. Anuskha Sharma does a great job playing Akira. Sharma very easily embodies this tom-boy hyper girl. But the moments in the movie where she is serious she also does very well, and she is able to cry on screen which is always a plus in portraying emotions! Other critics said that her character was too much and over the top, but if Sharma is representing modernism, which is overwhelming and all encompassing, then that is what the character needs to be as well, which is what she did. Some said her character has no dimension to her, but in the serious scenes we can see that is not true. Overall, all three did a wonderful job portraying their characters.In the end, this is a beautiful love story that sweeps you off your feet. And it's extra special because it is the last great work we will see of Yash Chopra. Enjoy the movie because it is spectacular.",5,Beautiful Love Story,1357171200,"01 3, 2013",2013,6055,"['beautiful', 'last', 'love', 'story', 'created', 'great', 'Yash', 'Chopra', 'story',

This first was a carefree, loving individual and the second a much more serious and tightly wound individual.  The dance number between Shahrukh and Katrina in the first part of the movie was fantastic!  I've never seen Shahrukh perform a dance number quite as athletic as this before and this was my first time ever seeing Katrina dance.  Of course it was also the first time I'd ever seen Shahrukh Khan actually kiss a woman in any of his movies, which was a bit of a surprise (part of his charm is being able to make love to a woman without actually kissing her)The soldier in the second part of the film reminded me of the Jeremy Renner character in the Hurt Locker (i.e. a fearless bomb defuser).  I liked the dynamic between the soldier (Samar Anand)and the Anushka Sharma (Akira) character.

1616676,ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T,B00ATCDFQU,Tsuyoshi,"[1, 1]","Veteran director Yash Chopra's last film ""Jab Tak Hai Jaan"" is a passionate romance with a wildly melodramatic storyline involving a love triangle, amnesia and a fearless bomb-squad leader with a past. Shahrukh Khan plays Major Samar Anand of the Indian army, who saves an aspiring video journalist Akira (Anushka Sharma) when she nearly drown in the lake.Then the movie flashbacks to London ten years ago when a young and poor street singer/waiter Samar meets a rich and religious girl Meera Thapar (Katrina Kaif) in a church. They fall in love with each other, though their romance is interrupted in an unusual fashion.Packed with star power, ""Jab Tak Hai Jaan"" is seldom boring with a story that is unapologetically melodramatic, and lovely musical sequences (with the score of A.R. Rahman). The beautiful location of Ladakh, the mountainous region where part of Shahrukh Khan's 1998 film ""Dil Se.."" was shot, is another plus.While some might refuse to take the film's soap opera-ish story at its face value, as in Douglas Sirk movies, and find some meaning somewhere deep inside, others simply enjoy the romantic story with so many twist and turns. Whichever you do, ""Jab Tak Hai Jaan"" is Bollywood romance at its best.",4,Bollywood Romance at its Best,1368403200,"05 13, 2013",2013,1223,"['Veteran', 'director', 'Yash', 'Chopra', 'last', 'film', 'Jab', 'Tak', 'Hai', 'Jaan', 'passionate', 'romance', 'wildly', 'melodramatic', 'storyline', 'involving', 'love', 'triangle', 'amnesia', 'fearless', 'bomb-squad', 'leader', 'past', 'Shahrukh', 'Khan', 'Major', 'Samar', 'Anand', 'Indian', 'army', 'who', 'aspiring', 'video', 'journalist', 'Akira', 'Anushka', 'Sharma', 'when', 'nearly', 'drown', 'lake.Then', 'movie', 'London', 'ten', 'years', 'ago', 'when', 'young', 'poor', 'street', 'singer/waiter', 'Samar', 'rich', 'religious', 'girl', 'Meera', 'Thapar', 'Katrina', 'Kaif', 'church', 'fall', 'love', 'other', 'romance', 'interrupted', 'unusual', 'fashion.Packed', 'star', 'power', 'Jab', 'Tak', 'Hai', 'Jaan', 'seldom', 'boring', 'story', 'unapologetically', 'melodramatic', 'lovely', 'musical', 'sequences', 'score', 'A.R', 'Rahman', 'beautiful', 'location', 'Ladakh', 'mountainous', 'region', 'where', 'part', 'Shahrukh', 'Khan', '1998', 'film', 'Dil', 'Se..', 'was', 'shot', 'plus.While', 'might', 'refuse', 'take', 'film', 'soap', 'opera-ish', 'story', 'face', 'value', 'Douglas', 'Sirk', 'movies', 'find', 'meaning', 'somewhere', 'deep', 'inside', 'others', 'simply', 'enjoy', 'romantic', 'story', 'so', 'many', 'twist', 'turns', 'do', 'Jab', 'Tak', 'Hai', 'Jaan', 'Bollywood', 'romance', 'best']",N/A
