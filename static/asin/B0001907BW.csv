796614,AVYMBTCXYREXE,B0001907BW,"Batmanbrb ""batmansbrb""","[26, 27]","In my opinion, Will & Grace was at their best in Season 2.  Every one of these episodes were some of the best sitcom writing in years.  W&G; earned a 'Best Comedy' Emmy from this season, as did Sean and Megan for supporting roles.  Season 2 offers some of my all-time favorite episodes.  Who can forgot 'Das Boob' when a picture in a newspaper makes Grace's chest appear much larger than they are - with the hilarious scene of Grace, Jack, and Will feeling each other up.  'To Serve and Disinfect' is awesome!!  Grace finds out Karen was in an adult fetish film and has some fun getting her back for all the mean put-downs Karen has thrown at her.  Also, Will works for Jack as a waiter serving lawyers.  This is one of the best episodes ever!!  'Homo for the Holidays' is outrageous!  Jack 'comes out' to his mother (as Karen says, ""What is she, headless?"") - a very well-written, socially responsible, yet so damn funny episode.  'The Hospital Show' where Stan is in the hospital and the gang all bet which one of them Karen will cry to first.  Karen finds out about the bet and has some fun with them.  'An Affair to Remember' features Rob & Ellen making wedding plans and later Ellen finds out that Grace slept with Rob.  So, to get back at him, she tries to sleep with Will - who can forgot her shaking her bra-laden boobies at Will saying, ""Get a load of these torpedoes!""  ""Girls, Interrupted"" was the most controversial episode of the season and ultimately one of the best.  Jack falls in love with a guy who's trying to get him 'back on the straight and narrow'.  So Karen and Jack attend one of his church-based meetings (turning gay people straight) only to expose everyone as attending a 'gay pick-up joint'.  I for one thought this was very brave writing and it is down-right funny.I guess I could go on and on, but if you really want to see the best episodes of Will & Grace, you have to buy Season 2.  It is without a doubt one of the finest sitcom seasons in television history.

Nominated for 49 Emmys, and winner of 12 (including Outstanding Comedy Series in 2000), the show follows the lives of two best friends who live together. With a plethora of other award nominations - 24 Golden Globes, 14 SAG Awards, and 6 People's Choice Awards, Will & Grace continues to light up the small screen with its unique brand of comic humor and groundbreaking sitcom format...Debra Messing stars in the role of Grace Adler, a straight interior designer who moves into an apartment with her best friend Will (Eric McCormack). Friends since college, Will is a successful lawyer who also happens to be gay (thus, keeping their relationship from becoming a permanent romantic one). Having dated before Will came out of the closet, the two maintain a more intimate relationship than mere casual friends. The comic sequences involving the two are complimented by Will's flamboyantly gay friend Jack McFarland (Sean Hayes) and Grace's sarcastic, alcoholic assistant Karen Walker (Megan Mullally)...The Will & Grace (Season 2) DVD features a number of hilarious episodes including the season premiere ""Guess Who's Not Coming to Dinner?"" in which Grace, having moved into the apartment across the hall, is nonetheless still reliant on Will for support. To prove to Will that she's not clingy, she throws a dinner party and refuses to invite him. Meanwhile, Jack moves in with Rosario in order to keep the government from deporting him... Other notable episodes from Season 2 include ""To Serve & Disinfect"" in which a newly unemployed Will agrees to work as a waiter for Jack's catering business only to end up working an American Bar Association function, and ""Advise & Resent"" in which Will is set up on a blind date by his boss (and Jack gives him some timely advice)...Below is a list of episodes included on the Will & Grace (Season 2) DVD:Episode 23 (Guess Who's Not Coming to Dinner?)Episode 24 (Election)Episode 25 (Das Boob)Episode 26 (Who's Mom is It Anyway?)Episode 27 (Polk Defeats Truman)Episode 28 (To Serve and Disinfect)Episode 29 (Homo for the Holidays)Episode 30 (Terms of Employment)Episode 31 (I Never Promised You an Olive Garden)Episode 32 (Tea and a Total Lack of Sympathy)Episode 33 (Seeds of Discontent)Episode 34 (He's Come Undone)Episode 35 (Oh Dad, Poor Dad, He's Kept Me in the Closet and I'm so Sad)Episode 36 (Acting Out)Episode 37 (Advise and Resent)Episode 38 (Hey La, Hey La, My Ex-boyfriend's Back)Episode 39 (The Hospital Show)Episode 40 (Sweet and Sour Charity)Episode 41 (An Affair to Forget)Episode 42 (Girls, Interrupted)Episode 43 (There but for the Grace of Grace)Episode 44 (My Best Friend's Tush)Episode 45 (Ben?

796619,A1YQ6QB2127AJ4,B0001907BW,David Anderson,"[2, 3]","""Will And Grace"" is one of the most hilarious shows on television.  This second season edition is only one way it displays that.  Those who thought season one was great are in for a thrill ride.  The jokes are funnier, the lifestyles are more flamboyant, the characters are more ""in-your-face"", and many more.  The writers prove that they know how to prolong audiences' enjoyment through their work.  Their brilliant work will go down in history.  Before the show began, only ""Ellen"", which starred Ellen DeGeneres, explored gay issues to this magnitude.  Such daring attempts deserve the ""Will And Grace"" cast and crew tremendous respect.  This brings the GLBT rights movement closer to success by letting audiences know that this is out there, and they must get over their hatred.""Will And Grace"" stars Debra Messing, Eric McCormick, Sean Hayes, and Megan Mullally.  This season saw the introduction of Shelley Morrison, Rosario, in the cast.  Every actor offers their own sense of humor into every episode.  Every episode shows many surprises from the actors, especially their behavior.  They never have a dull moment.  The guest celebrity stars offer added enjoyment to the show: Gregory Hines, Veronica Cartright, Neil Patrick Harris, Joan Collins, and more.Those who didn't watch the second season of ""Will And Grace"" when it originally aired (1999-2000) will get to see Will and Grace's struggle to find love while still living together, Karen still mourning her husband being lock up in prison, and of course, Jack being Jack.  This DVD set is one way to discover how the characters come to be who they are now.  Those who watched the show in its second season will also find enjoyment.  Regardless how many times each episode is watched, it never gets dull.  Those who love this collection should also buy the first season.

The only reason Grace keeps Karen around is for her leads and connections in the greater New York metropolitan area.  We also are introducted to Ben Deucett (the late, great Gregory Hines--yes, the same one best known for tap dancing into our hearts in films like TAP), crafty boss of lawyer Will Truman (Eric McCormack). We also have the great pleasure of seeing Debbie Reynolds, as Bobbie Adler, Grace's mother.  Reynolds totally hams it up on the program, and sends up her image as a big, on-screen musical theater diva.  The laughs come fast and furiously.  Of course, many of the greatest and biggest laughs are prompted by the antics of would-be song and dance man Jack McFarland (Sean Hayes), Will's best friend.

796623,AYB3CG5IVMTSN,B0001907BW,Dustin Merton,"[7, 13]","this is such a great show that i could rave about it forever but i wont for time reasons.  this season is really a standout season and is the season where sean hayes and megan mullaly and the show won their emmy's and all well deserved for that matter.  the highlights of the season are many but here are just a few of my favorites.  the water bra episode is one of the funniest ever done.  i like the part in the apartment where all three of them are feeling each other up, and then the part where grace and karen go shopping for the actual water bra.  then the part where the bra is punctured by karens broach.  there is also a funny side story where jack discovers that will once had a fling with one of his old boyfriends.  another episode has jack and rosario having to go in front of the ins people and prove they are really a couple, only to find out that jack had a fling with the ins guy, while will and grace are forced into a situation with grace's mom and her famous fix ups, except this time the fix up is for will.  one of the funniest scenes ever between karen and grace comes in the episode where karen is put on a budget by stan.  grace tries to help karen but karen wont listen and then grace holds one of her clothes hostage with some scissors.  she threatens the label then to here karen say, ""no honey that is the best part.""  when karen still refuses to listen grace tells karen that the blouse is her size and that she will go and try it on draws a scream from karen, utterly hilarious.  another great episode has grace discovering that karen once did a fetish film.  and to see her reaction is priceless.  my favorite line is ""whats hapeening, whats going on here why arent you licking that floor?""  then there is the classic thanksgiving episode where jack comes out to his mom, how she doesnt he is gay is beyond me.  i especially like the lie he told her about how grace was his girlfriend, and then karen decides to add to the lie and say that jack cheated on grace with her.  another episode has will trying to land karen as a client in his new law firm, he is so desperate that karen makes him do a little michelle pfeifer on a piano while singing an olivia newton john song.  while grace and jack go to antiques on the road so grace can do ""the face"" and jack can hook up with the cute appraiser porcelain paul.  my last favorite has grace and molly shannon, as the crazy val, bondind and then having another one of their hilarious fights.  on the other hand jack and karen attend a meeting of ex-gays because jack has a crush on one of the reformed gays, and goes in an attempt to get with him.  so the two of them both pose as ex-gays and i love the part where karen says something funny and say listen to me im a funny lesbian then raises her hand and says ""i'm ellen"" pure genius and gives ellen a great shout out.  there are so many more episodes to talk about, but those are

Harris ""The Voice of Reason""","[43, 53]","I would find it hard to believe that whoever was primarily responsible for assembling the package design for this DVD set still has his or her job.  Sloppy.  Just sloppy.The disc contents info listings are inaccurate, some of the shows are out of order (the 2-part finale leads off disc 4 instead of concluding it), an episode listed for one disc actually appears on another, etc.I thought we were supposed to be dealing with reasonably intelligent professional folks at these studios!  I'm sure many of them are doing their jobs well and accurately, but when goofs like this make it to the product when it hits the street it just makes everyone involved look incompetent.  Perhaps some of these mindless offenders are in a union and have protected jobs.  No motivation for excellence.  Perhaps.  Oh well.  End of rant.And now, the content itself:Season 2 is arguably funnier than season 1.  That is a tribute to the writers and the producers -- they found ways to keep the show fresh when the show could have so easily been stuck in a repetitive rut, repeating the same gay jokes over and over and over.The ""themed featurettes"" are once again disappointing.  All they are are 3-minute collections of show clips and punchlines.  Not exactly value-added material, y'know.Suggestion for Season 3's box set:  find someone with half a brain to personally see the development and production process through from start to finish.  Establish some direct accountability in the hopes of preventing the stupid, preventable design and chronology errors that made the Season 2 set look so unimpressive.  Heck, if they will pay me enough I will come do it myself.  Start to finish - initial concept to street release.  How much are the current folks getting paid for this, anyway?  Too much, apparently.Advance warning to the production company and studio:  Many of us will be deliberately searching for similar goofs when Season 3 comes out later.  Save yourselves some embarrassment and do your jobs right.  The top man or woman on the totem pole is just as responsible as the line employees at every step along the process.  Sloppy output and inefficiency = lack of respect for the consumer.Surely it should bother the DVD production staff that the lasting impression the consumers have of the Season 2 set is ""Great show, but the production staff is borderline incompetent"".

Jack moves in with Karen & Rosario.  Will loses his job, but finds another.  I won't list synopses of episodes, because a more diligent fan has listed them below.  This DVD is worth the excellent price on Amazon.  It's simply hilarious and makes good weekend watching.  However, there are a few problems with the DVD.  As for special features, there are no commentaries and no bloopers, only the themed featurettes which include scenes from the episodes.  The featurettes are indeed funny, but when you've seen all the episodes, they lose their luster.  The DVD box list of episodes is wrong - the first episodes of discs 2, 3, and 4 are actually the last episodes on discs 1, 2, and 3.  And on disc 4, the episodes are out of order (they appear to be backward).  This isn't that big of a deal, as you can watch them in order if you choose, but I was surprised when I pressed ""Play all"" to find that the last episode was first (I hope that makes sense).  You'd think that NBC or Lions Gate would have found those mistakes before releasing the DVD.Let's face it - we buy these DVDs for the convenience of watching episodes whenever we choose.  I would have enjoyed bloopers, interviews, and commentaries, but Will & Grace shines on it's own.  The episodes are 5-star, but the DVD itself is only 3 (because of the mix-ups and the lack of bloopers and commentaries which I was led to believe would be on this set).

I bought Season 1 around Christmas last year and instally fell in love with the show.  The first episode had me laughing right from the get go.  I just love all the characters in the show.  They all have their own uniqueness about them.  Since I fell in love with Season 1, of course, I had to get season 2.  I just finished watching the entire season and loved it. My favorite episodes of this season were Das [...](hilarious scene with the bra!!)An Affair to Forget(the part with the stripper and Jack was funny!)and To server and Disinfect(Karen in a fetish film !! Funny!)  These are just a few of the great ones but the whole season is great.  Go buy this one if you like to laugh!!

The show has one of the wackiest ensembles in TV with Sean Hayes and Megan Mullaly often stealing the show. But big credit should also be given to Debra Messing and Eric Mccormack who both provided some sense of reality to the over the top and larger than life characters that populate the show. I don't think Hayes and Mullaly wouldn't be as effective if not for Messing and Mccormack (jokes poking fun at will and Grace). And besides Karen and Jack may be the comedic core of the show, but the heart and soul of the show are Will and Grace.Some of the best episodes of the second season are:-Guess Who's Not Coming to Dinner-Das Boob (a great episode for Messing)-To Serve and Disinfect (Mullaly stole the show and she had a great moment with Grace when she was hurt by the porn jokes)-Homo for the holidays (one of the best episodes of the series, great ensemble episode)-Hey La, Hey La, My Ex-boyfriend's Back (watch out for Mullaly's very funny scenes as she tried to design a chair)-The Hospital Show-Sweet and Sour Shoe-He's Come UndoneGrade: A",5,"Will, Grace, Jack and Karen",1122940800,"08 2, 2005",2005,1181,"['Season', '2', 'probably', 'best', 'season', 'show', 'incidentally', 'season', 'where', 'show', 'won', 'Emmy', 'Outstanding', 'Series', 'show', 'one', 'wackiest', 'ensembles', 'TV', 'Sean', 'Hayes', 'Megan', 'Mullaly', 'often', 'stealing', 'show', 'big', 'credit', 'should', 'also', 'be', 'given', 'Debra', 'Messing', 'Eric', 'Mccormack', 'who', 'provided', 'sense', 'reality', 'top', 'larger', 'life', 'characters', 'populate', 'show', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'Hayes', 'Mullaly', 'would', ""n't"", 'be', 'effective', 'not', 'Messing', 'Mccormack', 'jokes', 'poking', 'fun', 'will', 'Grace', 'Karen', 'Jack', 'may', 'be', 'comedic', 'core', 'show', 'heart', 'soul', 'show', 'are', 'Will', 'Grace.Some', 'best', 'episodes', 'second', 'season', 'are', '-Guess', 'Who', 'Not', 'Coming', 'Dinner-Das', 'Boob', 'great', 'episode', 'Messing', '-To', 'Serve', 'Disinfect', 'Mullaly', 'stole', 'show', 'had', 'great', 'moment', 'Grace', 'when', 'was', 'hurt', 'porn', 'jokes', '-Homo', 'holidays', 'one', 'best', 'episodes', 'series', 'great', 'ensemble', 'episode', '-Hey', 'La', 'Hey', 'La', 'My', 'Ex-boyfriend', 'Back', 'watch', 'Mullaly', 'very', 'funny', 'scenes', 'tried', 'design', 'chair', 'Hospital', 'Show-Sweet', 'Sour', 'Shoe-He', 'Come', 'UndoneGrade', 'A']",Will & Grace - Season Two

I'm surprised that NBC let such a mix-up slip by, especially for one of their highest-rated shows (I could understand if the episodes were backwards, but they are completely shuffled around randomly).  Unfortunately, I didn't realize this until I'd watched all the DVDs, and remained confused about what had happened after the ""final"" episode.  I realize this may not be that big a deal to most people, but this really bothered me and took a little bit away from the last couple of episodes since I wasn't so much focused on the humor, but trying to put illogical pieces together.The extras are also skimpy (same kind of featurettes as the previous season's DVD, and no interviews this time), but at least all the episodes are there... in some order.I just hope NBC wakes up when making the next season's DVDs...",3,"Great show, truly sloppy DVD...",1082332800,"04 19, 2004",2004,1181,"['Will', 'Grace', 'second', 'season', 'even', 'better', 'first', 'still', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'best', 'whole', 'season', 'shows', 'promise', 'along', 'finale', 'speaking', 'other', 'reviewers', 'have', 'mentioned', 'episodes', 'last', 'disc', 'are', 'completely', 'order', 'need', 'use', 'episode', 'guide', 'booklet', 'order', 'avoid', 'confusion', ""'m"", 'surprised', 'NBC', 'let', 'such', 'mix-up', 'slip', 'especially', 'one', 'highest-rated', 'shows', 'could', 'understand', 'episodes', 'were', 'backwards', 'are', 'completely', 'shuffled', 'randomly', 'Unfortunately', 'did', ""n't"", 'realize', ""'d"", 'watched', 'DVDs', 'remained', 'confused', 'what', 'had', 'happened', 'final', 'episode', 'realize', 'may', 'not', 'be', 'big', 'deal', 'most', 'people', 'really', 'bothered', 'took', 'little', 'bit', 'away', 'last', 'couple', 'episodes', 'was', ""n't"", 'so', 'much', 'focused', 'humor', 'trying', 'put', 'illogical', 'pieces', 'together.The', 'extras', 'are', 'also', 'skimpy', 'same', 'kind', 'featurettes', 'previous', 'season', 'DVD', 'interviews', 'time', 'least', 'episodes', 'are', 'there', 'order.I', 'just', 'hope', 'NBC', 'up', 'when', 'making', 'next', 'season', 'DVDs']",Will & Grace - Season Two
