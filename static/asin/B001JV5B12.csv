Kate Beckinsale is great and has fantastic chemistry with the leading man.  While the third movie (Rise of the Lycans) wasn't as good as the first two, I am for sure excited to see the next movie (due out in 2011 with Kate reprising her role)!",5,Great movie!,1290124800,"11 19, 2010",2010,342,"['time', 'when', 'Vampires', 'seem', 'be', 'rage', 'find', 'be', 'one', 'best', 'movies/series', 'Kate', 'Beckinsale', 'great', 'fantastic', 'chemistry', 'leading', 'man', 'third', 'movie', 'Rise', 'Lycans', 'was', ""n't"", 'as', 'good', 'first', 'two', 'am', 'sure', 'excited', 'see', 'next', 'movie', 'due', 'out', '2011', 'Kate', 'reprising', 'role']",N/A

As the story emerges, we learn that the story dates back 600 years to when the lycans guarded the vampires by day, until a betrayal gave the lycans the overall edge and started an era of distrust.Now, the life-eternal is a continual power struggle between the two groups, also within each group and occurring in an Underworld void of human beings. So, the plot is removed from the usual struggles for humans to end the threat. There are no humans, only hybrids; a perfect mating between vampire and werewolf. Scott Speedman plays such a hybrid.Kate Beckinsale plays a powerful vampire, almost queen-like. The mystery of her heritage is unlocked in Underworld Evolution, as she and Speedman team to end the treachery.The two discs represent good entertainment. Costumes and action sequences are very life-like.",3,VAMPIRES VERSES LYCANS,1327622400,"01 27, 2012",2012,919,"['Plotting', 'slowly', 'developed', 'various', 'action', 'sequences', 'battles', 'vampires', 'lycans', 'story', 'learn', 'story', 'back', '600', 'years', 'when', 'lycans', 'guarded', 'vampires', 'day', 'betrayal', 'gave', 'lycans', 'overall', 'edge', 'started', 'era', 'distrust.Now', 'life-eternal', 'continual', 'power', 'struggle', 'two', 'groups', 'also', 'group', 'occurring', 'Underworld', 'void', 'human', 'beings', 'So', 'plot', 'removed', 'usual', 'struggles', 'humans', 'end', 'threat', 'are', 'humans', 'only', 'perfect', 'mating', 'vampire', 'werewolf', 'Scott', 'Speedman', 'hybrid.Kate', 'Beckinsale', 'powerful', 'vampire', 'almost', 'queen-like', 'mystery', 'heritage', 'unlocked', 'Underworld', 'Evolution', 'Speedman', 'team', 'end', 'treachery.The', 'two', 'discs', 'represent', 'good', 'entertainment', 'Costumes', 'action', 'sequences', 'are', 'very', 'life-like']",N/A
