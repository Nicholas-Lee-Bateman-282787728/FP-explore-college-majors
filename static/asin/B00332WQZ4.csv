Mcarthur,"[4, 6]","This film shares perspectives from a hand full of veterans - and lots of unfortunate scenes of gratuitous violence and death.It is not from &#8220;generations&#8221; of vets &#8211; as to suggest from dozens of perspectives.  It is actually very limited in numerous ways.  While some servicemen and women can relate to the five whole stories recounted and often emotional memories &#8211; their shared experiences relate an extremely limited viewpoint.  Keep in mind hundreds of thousands of people fought in these conflicts.The bottom-line  -- Their stories, while a few of them are very poignant, are carefully selected and edited and slanted by the directors toward pacifist, antiwar sentiments. Most take no slanting at all &#8211; half the vets interviewed clearly have unresolved mental issues dealing with their experiences and have become active anti-war protestors.  So how can the viewer expect these particular vets to be objective about their experiences &#8211; they each lose some credibility, I think.To suggest this documentary is a &#8220;complete look at war and its consequences&#8221; is ridiculous.As unfortunate as it may be, there is still evil in the world and still purposeful, strategic purposes for the careful application of force as it is necessary to fight that evil and protect our country&#8217;s interests and innocent life here and abroad.There are much better documentaries done on the costs and impacts of war weighed against its necessity &#8211; far more objective than this one.You&#8217;ll notice the least shown, and most objective story shared, comes from the WWII vet &#8211; but you hear very little from him.

1319709,A1S8AJIUIO6M9K,B00332WQZ4,Robert David STEELE Vivas,"[2, 2]","I found this movie very compelling and am putting it into circulation as a shared good.  It is built around four specific veterans (one each from WWII, Viet-Nam, and Gulf I) and does a superb job of weaving direct interviews, past photos of the three protagonists, and archival film clips.The Marine from Gulf I is especially compelling as he tells of his deliberate refusal to accept a Conscientious Objective discharge after killing over 30 people in Iraq, and ultimately, with the aid of a high-powered lawyer, prevails in getting an Honorable Discharge.The same Marine--and the others--discuss how one must train normal people to kill, and there is no thought of how to untrain them (war dogs get reintegration training, humans do not).The clear message, in these words:  We are One, and War is no way to settle disagreements.  That is of course both correct and naive--it discounts the fact that Empire is about money for a few, and the troops are merely cannon fodder.  That's the first thing we have to change--take the money out of war and into peace.In that light, I add General Smedley Butler's book,War is a Racket: The Antiwar Classic by America's Most Decorated Soldierand removing my earlier recommendations of DVDs in which war is glorified.I add instead several references that probe who we are as a nation (America).What Kind of Nation: Thomas Jefferson, John Marshall, and the Epic Struggle to Create a United StatesThe Thirteen American Arguments: Enduring Debates That Define and Inspire Our CountryA Foreign Policy of Freedom: Peace, Commerce, and Honest FriendshipConsider this movie along with:Why We FightThe Fog of War: Lessons from the Life of Robert S.
