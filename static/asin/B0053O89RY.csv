Jones ""Andy""","[0, 0]","TV feels inundated with sitcoms, but Modern Family manages to rise about most of the crowd with its interesting characters and unique brand of humor.  From the opening episode I was hooked, with each of the three families being followed offering a different 'feel' but each being equally funny.  The show follows a format of three separate storylines in most episodes, which it usually manages to tie together in the end with some kind of unified theme.  It is an interesting format, and the writers have really made it work.Season 3 is well worth checking out if you were a fan of the previous season.  The families manage to grow and adapt just enough to keep their characters interesting, but without hurting the original formula that makes the show work.",5,Great follow-up to season 2,1397520000,"04 15, 2014",2014,758,"['TV', 'feels', 'inundated', 'sitcoms', 'Modern', 'Family', 'rise', 'most', 'crowd', 'interesting', 'characters', 'unique', 'brand', 'humor', 'opening', 'episode', 'was', 'hooked', 'three', 'families', 'being', 'followed', 'offering', 'different', ""'feel"", 'being', 'equally', 'funny', 'show', 'format', 'three', 'separate', 'storylines', 'most', 'episodes', 'usually', 'tie', 'together', 'end', 'kind', 'unified', 'theme', 'interesting', 'format', 'writers', 'have', 'really', 'made', 'work.Season', '3', 'well', 'worth', 'checking', 'out', 'were', 'fan', 'previous', 'season', 'families', 'manage', 'grow', 'adapt', 'just', 'enough', 'keep', 'characters', 'interesting', 'hurting', 'original', 'formula', 'show', 'work']",N/A

I thoroughly enjoyed the first two seasons so naturally I would want the third. There are definitely some memorable episodes this season. Phil and Cam remain my favorite characters and my least favorite, Luke, seemed to noticably improve. However, I wouldn't say season 3 is on par with the previous two, and I'm not exactly sure why that is. Perhaps it's the change in the actress who plays Lilly, maybe it was due to Cam & Mitch and Phil & Claire getting into arguements practically every ep, or perhaps it's just that I enjoyed more eps in the prior seasons than this one; I don't know but there it is. I would recommend this show to anyone who likes good old-fashioned family television because there's something for everybody in it, especially if you've seen at least some of the show already but not yet S3. I can say that this is the season that 'stole the show' as it were with awards, and also why they all received a salary increase for season 4; I just hope they can keep up the quality.",4,Still going strong,1350259200,"10 15, 2012",2012,1071,"['Modern', 'Family', 'great', 'show', 'one', 'best', 'TV', 'moment', 'IMHO', 'thoroughly', 'enjoyed', 'first', 'two', 'seasons', 'naturally', 'would', 'want', 'third', 'are', 'definitely', 'memorable', 'episodes', 'season', 'Phil', 'Cam', 'remain', 'favorite', 'characters', 'least', 'favorite', 'Luke', 'seemed', 'noticably', 'improve', 'However', 'would', ""n't"", 'say', 'season', '3', 'par', 'previous', 'two', ""'m"", 'not', 'exactly', 'sure', 'why', 'Perhaps', 'change', 'actress', 'who', 'Lilly', 'maybe', 'was', 'due', 'Cam', 'Mitch', 'Phil', 'Claire', 'getting', 'arguements', 'practically', 'ep', 'perhaps', 'just', 'enjoyed', 'more', 'eps', 'prior', 'seasons', 'one', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'would', 'recommend', 'show', 'anyone', 'who', 'good', 'old-fashioned', 'family', 'television', 'something', 'everybody', 'especially', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'least', 'show', 'already', 'not', 'yet', 'S3', 'can', 'say', 'season', 'show', 'were', 'awards', 'also', 'why', 'received', 'salary', 'increase', 'season', '4', 'just', 'hope', 'can', 'keep', 'up', 'quality']",N/A

Mind you, this extended family has its issues but they stand as one united family when times are tough. MODERN FAMILY is one of the best, if not the best, comedy on TV. Season 3 did not disappoint. Jay is the patriach of the family and is remarried to a much younger sexy, saucy Colombian wife Gloria are raising her son Manny. Gloria is actually slightly younger than Jay's daughter Claire. Claire and Phil are a married couple with the ""traditional"" family - two daughters and a son. Claire's brother Mitchell lives with his gay partner Cam and their adopted Vietnamese daughter Lilly. Hence, we have the modern family - a blended mix of cultures and non-traditional families together as one big, loving family.The show is incredibly well-written and the cast is a pure delight. They all live near to each other so the lives of parents and children and cousins constantly merge. Gloria with her feisty Latina temper and heavy accent brings a special love and joy to the family. Goofy Phil Dunphy is the kind of silly but loving father that we all wish we had had. Gloria's son Manny is the glue that binds everyone together. This 13 year old is wiser and more mature than any of the adults. The show does play on stereotypes at times--the fiery latina and the effeminate gay men, yet somehow it is all done in good fun and respectable good taste. There is no meanness to the humor. Just sit back and roar with the laughter. There is a particularly finally episode of the family spending the day at the Disneyland Resort.

I thoroughly enjoyed the episode though. There were a lot of things in it that I could relate to. I've gone to Disneyland several times in my life and it was funny seeing things that I've personally gone through or seen while at Disneyland. I found it very funny and very easy to watch.I recommend this to anyone who loves Disneyland. If you don't know the characters or haven't really seen the show (like me) it's still a great episode to watch for Disney fans. The only thing I didn't like about the episode is that it felt a little short.
