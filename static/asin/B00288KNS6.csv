1255631,A1Y09QLADQYQJG,B00288KNS6,&#34;T=H=E --- 'Older Than Dirt' --- Time Tra...,"[1, 1]","I happen to like George Lopez [anyway], and this silly comedy was 85% off.I realize it didn't win any Academy Awards... but I haven't SEEN many that DID...that I liked.Okay, so it AIN'T ""Citizen Kane"" or ""Ghandi"" It was $1.53, WHAT did I have to lose?___________________________________________________________________Update: I just finished watching the movie. I noticed it STILL costs between a pennyand $5 (dependent upon WHERE). I got a great deal, because, occasionally, I check-outwarehouse deals. It wasn't even the cheapest DVD I got. The audio/video was exceptional,and the story was entertaining. The 2009 Nickelodeon movie was presented --- because ofTHAT year --- in anomorphic widescreen (zooming NOT necessary), and ""full"" [glass picturetube] screen. The special features and previews are, therefor, ""window-boxed"" so you'llHAVE to ZOOM those unless you WANT black-bars on all four sides of the picture.The picture --- like I mentioned --- for the main-feature presentation is flawless, and,as seen on my 55"" widescreen, without fault... looking HD, through my Blu-ray player; Ibought the DVD... the BD is slightly more.Several of the girls appeared inThe Diary of a Wimpy Kid 1, 2 & 3 [Blu-ray].

And also the extra's on this DVD was good also you get a chance to see his wife talk and get to see his daughter who was in the movie get a chance to talk as well.
