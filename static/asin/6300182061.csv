A truly  inspirational story which shows that life can indeed continue and can even  be good, even in the face of overwhelming odds.

200724,A14JEURPY1CXZB,6300182061,James D. Leverton,"[29, 29]","""The Other Side of the Mountain"" tells the true-life story of '50's Olympic skiing hopeful Jill Kinmont, whose career was cut short by a devastating skiing accident that left her a paraplegic.  The film follows her triumphant recovery and struggle to maintain a normal life.  As directed by Larry Peerce, the film is inspiring, funny, sad, filled with good performances and features the beautiful vistas of California's Eastern Sierra Madres, in particular those surrounding the lovely town of Bishop.  Unfortunately, David Seltzer's script is the weak link, as it never rises above the level of standard Hollywood biopic, with spotty dialog and a tendency to lapse into uncomfortable melodrama.  Still, most viewers will ignore the hoakum and be totally engrossed in Kinmont's story.Little-know starlet Marilyn Hassett plays Kinmont, and it's a good performance--even though she's clearly in her mid-twenties, she's believable as a giggly adolescent, and appropriately plucky when in full survival mode after tragedy strikes.  Beau Bridges and Belinda J. Montgomery lend valuable support as first love (and fellow champion) Dick ""Mad Dog"" Buekand childhood best friend Audra Jo, whose own career was ended by polio.  While Bridges is the big scene stealer as a maverick whose tough-love rehabilitation approach will undoubtedly raise eyebrows, Montgomery is the true standout as the kind of friend everyone should have.  Nan Martin and William Bryant as Jill's parents and Dabney Coleman (in an early role) as Jill's supportive coach round out the fine cast.  And for once that most overworked of cinematic conceits, namely the framing device, works wonderfully well as an older Jill looks back on her life while teaching a class of Indian children.In all, ""The Other Side of the Mountain"" is an inspiring tale, with an ending that will leave all but the most jaded of viewers wiping away a tear or two.  And while the execution may be a tad hokey and uninspired, one thing is undeniable:  while most films fade from memory almost immediately, Kinmont's story will stay with you for a lifetime.  It's been nearly thirty years since I first saw this film, and to this day, whenever I pass through Bishop, I wonder how Jill is doing, and hope life has brought her all the happiness she deserves.  **** (out of *****)A note to Universal Home Video:  you've released ""Gable and Lombard"" on DVD, which was a complete flop from 1976 and critically maligned as an inaccurate and dishonest portrait of the great screen couple.  ""The Other Side of the Mountain,"" however, was a box-office success in 1975 and in its 1976 reissue and received decent notices from critics, yet it languishes on VHS with no DVD release date in sight.  What gives?  Please release this movie, with an update of Jill Kinmont.",4,"Uninspired retelling of incredible, inspirational true story",1092441600,"08 14, 2004",2004,2795,"['Other', 'Side', 'Mountain', 'true-life', 'story', ""'50"", 'Olympic', 'skiing', 'hopeful', 'Jill', 'Kinmont', 'career', 'was', 'cut', 'short', 'devastating', 'skiing', 'accident', 'left', 'paraplegic', 'film', 'triumphant', 'recovery', 'struggle', 'maintain', 'normal', 'life', 'directed', 'Larry', 'Peerce', 'film', 'inspiring', 'funny', 'sad', 'filled', 'good', 'performances', 'beautiful', 'vistas', 'California', 'Eastern', 'Sierra', 'Madres', 'particular', 'surrounding', 'lovely', 'town', 'Bishop', 'Unfortunately', 'David', 'Seltzer', 'script', 'weak', 'link', 'never', 'level', 'standard', 'Hollywood', 'biopic', 'spotty', 'dialog', 'tendency', 'lapse', 'uncomfortable', 'melodrama', 'Still', 'most', 'viewers', 'will', 'ignore', 'hoakum', 'be', 'totally', 'engrossed', 'Kinmont', 'story.Little-know', 'starlet', 'Marilyn', 'Hassett', 'Kinmont', 'good', 'performance', 'even', 'clearly', 'mid-twenties', 'believable', 'giggly', 'adolescent', 'appropriately', 'plucky', 'when', 'full', 'survival', 'mode', 'tragedy', 'strikes', 'Beau', 'Bridges', 'Belinda', 'J.', 'Montgomery', 'lend', 'valuable', 'support', 'first', 'love', 'fellow', 'champion', 'Dick', 'Mad', 'Dog', 'Buekand', 'childhood', 'best', 'friend', 'Audra', 'Jo', 'own', 'career', 'was', 'ended', 'polio', 'Bridges', 'big', 'scene', 'stealer', 'maverick', 'tough-love', 'rehabilitation', 'approach', 'will', 'undoubtedly', 'raise', 'eyebrows', 'Montgomery', 'true', 'standout', 'kind', 'friend', 'everyone', 'should', 'have', 'Nan', 'Martin', 'William', 'Bryant', 'Jill', 'parents', 'Dabney', 'Coleman', 'early', 'role', 'Jill', 'supportive', 'coach', 'round', 'fine', 'cast', 'once', 'most', 'overworked', 'cinematic', 'conceits', 'namely', 'framing', 'device', 'wonderfully', 'well', 'older', 'Jill', 'back', 'life', 'teaching', 'class', 'Indian', 'children.In', 'Other', 'Side', 'Mountain', 'inspiring', 'tale', 'ending', 'will', 'leave', 'most', 'jaded', 'viewers', 'wiping', 'away', 'tear', 'two', 'execution', 'may', 'be', 'tad', 'hokey', 'uninspired', 'one', 'thing', 'undeniable', 'most', 'films', 'fade', 'memory', 'almost', 'immediately', 'Kinmont', 'story', 'will', 'stay', 'lifetime', 'been', 'nearly', 'thirty', 'years', 'first', 'saw', 'film', 'day', 'whenever', 'pass', 'Bishop', 'wonder', 'how', 'Jill', 'doing', 'hope', 'life', 'brought', 'happiness', '****', '*****', 'note', 'Universal', 'Home', 'Video', ""'ve"", 'released', 'Gable', 'Lombard', 'DVD', 'was', 'complete', 'flop', '1976', 'critically', 'maligned', 'inaccurate', 'dishonest', 'portrait', 'great', 'screen', 'couple', 'Other', 'Side', 'Mountain', 'however', 'was', 'box-office', 'success', '1975', '1976', 'reissue', 'received', 'decent', 'notices', 'critics', 'VHS', 'DVD', 'release', 'date', 'sight', 'What', 'Please', 'release', 'movie', 'update', 'Jill', 'Kinmont']",The Other Side of the Mountain VHS
