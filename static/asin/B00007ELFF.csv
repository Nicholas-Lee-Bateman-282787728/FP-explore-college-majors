For one thing, there was the item of physical non-resemblance.  But with the addition of a little nose putty, I was suprised to be able to see Lennon quite easily in Harris.  Quinn's physical resemblance to McCartney is even more remote (you can add putty to a nose but you can't perform rhinoplastic reduction with makeup!), but factor in the clothes and hair and he comes closer.  But it's the body language and speech which make him convincing.  I didn't notice in the credits if there was a vocal coach, but if there was, he/she knows his/her stuff.  If the actors developed their own accents and cadences, that's even more to their credit.  They obviously studied these men assiduously.  In some scenes I found myself feeling horribly sentimental, being of a &quot;certain age.&quot;  The picture is nicely staged, paced, and photographed.

After some initial awkwardness (which pops up again throughout the film when they talk about open wounds) they unexpectedly spend the day catching up, leading to an uneasy reconciliation (personal of course, not professional)This movie is great because it not only captures John and Paul at this particular moment of their lives, (Aidan Quinn surprisingly plays Paul very well and Jared Harris as John is even better)but it also effectively captures the feeling of seeing an old friend who you may have outgrown but still love.It also captured the feel of 1976 well for a low budget production and beatle fans will enjoy the little snippets of beatle lore in the script .(the saturday night live offer was great as were the stories of Ringo and George circa 1976)The only thing that didn't ring true was Yoko's total absence- which was unlikely but probably dramatically necessary. After all, this was ""two of us"", not ""two of us and the one who ruined our friendship!""It would be nice if an interviewer someday asked Paul McCartney if he has seen this film.

First of all, though they did their share, there is a unwarranted dope scene where John sniffs weed like an idiot. The wigs and accents are terrible. They sound worse then the old Beatle cartoons. John is the nasty, envious, closet homosexual, slave to Yoko he is portrayed as being in the discredited Albert Goldman book. They even keep spouting song titles in regular conversation ""it was always just the Two Of Us""! John would not have been mean to his fans like this either. Like his death showed us he was too nice if anything. The one funny scene is where a dumb Beatle fan only recognizes John and asks him to sing Paul's Yesterday. An insulted John says something along the lines of ""Sure and while I croon why don't you get down on your knees, put on your wife's wig, and lick my liggin"". That made me laugh for days.

727667,A1G42TTYZYQC5S,B00007ELFF,Enslowe,"[3, 3]","This movie is an amusing piece of fiction. The actors do a pretty good job channeling the personas of Lennon and McCartney, and giving obsessed fans a happier ending than ever was. The entire enterprise is strange; so beloved are the Beatles, that some fans must sit around imagining how wonderful it would be if John and Paul had made up completely in the seventies, palled around with feeling, ran around Central Park like schoolboys in ""A Hard Day's Night,"" sang together, etc. Fans take it all so personally. Can we not love the Beatles warts and all, as genuine flawed human beings who never entirely conformed to our image of what they ought to be and do? Must they be the friendly mop tops forever? The second half of Lennon's life was a difficult struggle against that image and the expectations of fame in general. Here all that is cheerily kicked aside, because the public would rather he had made peace with his old partner. Okay, there is some complexity in this film, and it isn't a hack job, but the underlying premise remains unsettling to me. This film does not claim to be fact, but the real history was so interesting that I don't like fictional rewrites of that history. Read Lennon's fascinating ""Playboy"" interviews from 1980 and you will get a much truer picture of this situation late in Lennon's life. Rest assured, this is pure fiction, and frankly kinda weird. Here is the heart-to-heart chat they never had; what are we supposed to do when we wake up from this dream? The dream is over, mate.

He could give two hoots about the record businessat this point, and works only when he wants to.Paul, on the other hand, loves being who he is and making music, which John chidesevery chance he gets as ""Silly Love Songs"" and ""Nursery Rhymes"", much to Paul's chagrin.These two start off cautious and cool towards each other....Paul more warm than John.Slowly the ice begins to melt as they reminisce and re-connect.They laugh and joke and play music and sing songs one minute, then arein heated verbal fights the next, running the gamut of emotions you might(ehh-hem!) imagine (forgive the pun!) them to feel after seeing each other forthe first time in six years.  (-:They even go out on the town incognito, dressed in ridiculous derby hats and moustaches.John, ever caustic and sardonic, really reams out a fan or two who recognize the twoin a restuarant and come over with Beatles-talk and making ridiculous demands.The scene is hilarious, and seems like something that John may have actually done.Overall, this is a great little flight of creative fancy which gives us an glimpseof what might have really happened in this alleged and fateful reunion.I found it to be engrossing, humorous in places, and very charming.If you're into The Beatles, Paul McCartney and John Lennon, you'll love this!",5,"An Interesting ""What-If"" Movie!!---Spectres Of What Might've Been??",1286928000,"10 13, 2010",2010,2647,"['think', 'Aidan', 'Quinn', 'Paul', 'McCartney', 'who', ""'ve"", 'appreciated', 'many', 'different', 'rolesdown', 'years', 'Jared', 'Harris', 'looks', 'acts', 'Lennon', 'so', 'much', 'thatit', 'spooky', 'times', 'did', 'wonderful', 'job', 'what-if', 'movie', 'supposedlybased', 'actual', 'impromptu', 'meeting', 'ex-Beatles', '/', 'musical', 'partners', '/', 'friendsPaul', 'McCartney', 'John', 'Lennon', 'NYC', '1976.In', 'movie', 'Beatles', 'have', 'been', 'broken', 'up', '1970', 'nice', 'clean', 'break', '-Many', 'hurt', 'feelings', 'bruised', 'egos.After', 'not', 'speaking', 'six', 'years', 'throwing', 'barbs', 'other', 'ininterviews', 'well', 'John', 'least', 'Paul', 'who', 'peak', 'WINGS', 'period', 'NYC', '4', 'sold-out', 'shows', 'Madison', 'Square', 'Garden', 'when', 'pay', 'hisold', 'friend', '/', 'nemesis', 'John', 'Lennon', 'visit', 'Dakota.John', 'been', 'basically', 'music', 'game', 'exceptions', 'sincethe', 'early', '70', 'moved', 'New', 'York', 'Yoko', 'Ono', 'have', 'child', 'together..Sean', 'Lennon', 'who', 'John', 'more', 'happy', 'dote', 'father', 'husband', 'could', 'never', 'be', 'back', 'youth', 'when', 'oldest', 'sonJulian', 'was', 'born', 'first', 'wife', 'Cynthia', 'were', 'together.He', 'basically', 'likes', 'hanging', 'out', 'living', 'life', 'live', 'free', 'being', 'controlled', 'madness', 'Beatlemania', '60', ""Yoko'sprotest"", 'period', 'early', '70', 'could', 'give', 'two', 'hoots', 'record', 'businessat', 'point', 'only', 'when', 'to.Paul', 'other', 'hand', 'loves', 'being', 'who', 'making', 'music', 'John', 'chidesevery', 'chance', 'Silly', 'Love', 'Songs', 'Nursery', 'Rhymes', 'much', 'Paul', 'chagrin.These', 'two', 'start', 'cautious', 'cool', 'towards', 'other', 'more', 'warm', 'John.Slowly', 'ice', 'melt', 'reminisce', 're-connect.They', 'laugh', 'joke', 'play', 'music', 'sing', 'songs', 'one', 'minute', 'then', 'arein', 'heated', 'verbal', 'fights', 'next', 'running', 'gamut', 'emotions', 'might', 'ehh-hem', 'imagine', 'forgive', 'pun', 'feel', 'seeing', 'other', 'forthe', 'first', 'time', 'six', 'years', 'even', 'go', 'out', 'town', 'incognito', 'dressed', 'ridiculous', 'derby', 'hats', 'moustaches.John', 'ever', 'caustic', 'sardonic', 'really', 'out', 'fan', 'two', 'who', 'recognize', 'twoin', 'restuarant', 'come', 'Beatles-talk', 'making', 'ridiculous', 'demands.The', 'scene', 'hilarious', 'something', 'John', 'may', 'have', 'actually', 'done.Overall', 'great', 'little', 'flight', 'creative', 'fancy', 'glimpseof', 'what', 'might', 'have', 'really', 'happened', 'alleged', 'fateful', 'reunion.I', 'found', 'be', 'engrossing', 'humorous', 'places', 'very', 'charming.If', ""'re"", 'Beatles', 'Paul', 'McCartney', 'John', 'Lennon', ""'ll"", 'love']",Two of Us

727672,A19JYLHD94K94D,B00007ELFF,Itamar Katz,"[6, 7]","Being the Beatlemaniac that I am, I approached Two Of Us with a combination of fear and fascination. Having seen 'In His Life: The John Lennon Story', I was quite concerned that Two Of Us will turn out no better. The fact that Aidan Quinn and Jared Harris look absolutely nothing like John Lennon and Paul McCartney - even with some make-up and proper hairdos - didn't help one bit.But I was more than a bit pleasantly surprised. It's probably thanks to the involvement of Michael Lindsay-Hogg, who directed Let It Be in 1970 and consequently probably knew John and Paul quite well, that the characters and the dialogue came across as convincing as they did. (The writing credit for Two Of Us is given to a man named Mark Stanfield, of whom I know absolutely nothing; I feel confident that director Lindsay-Hogg had more than a bit to do with the script.) Two Of Us is not a biography of the Beatles; it has very little plot, in fact, and takes place all in one day in New York City. What it does is imagine a meeting between John and Paul in 1976, while John lived in New York. That meeting is entirely fictitious, of course - though it can't truly be disproved that such a meeting actually took place. But through that imagined conversation it gives us a glimpse into the personalities of these two great musicians - their intelligence, their sense of humor, their different reaction to stardom, and most of all their relationship; what made them such a great team, and what broke them up.Since it's a talk movie, nothing much except for dialogue between two characters for an hour and a half, it's likely to bore all but true fans of the Beatles; but it's a fantastic piece of writing and storytelling, and is both informative and touching. For those interested in these two musical giants, very quickly you'll get over the shock of how different the actors look from their counterparts and feel like John and Paul had come to life - so intimate and convincing is the script, and so committed are the actors. Two Of Us gives you priceless insight into the lives of two geniuses, and a tale that is both sad and funny.

Pellegrini ""sockii""","[5, 6]","I'll admit it, I'm a sucker for good ""fan-fiction"" about my favorite bands and musicians, and that was the lure to me when I first heard about this movie. A ""what if"" story about a rumored meeting between the long-estranged band members, this film delivered more than I'd ever hoped for.The lead actors may not bear the strongest physical resemblance to John and Paul, but they more than make up for it in the way they both seem to ""inhabit"" these ""characters"", and allow you to fall under the illusion they create for the film. And for a film that is primarily 90 minutes of two people talking (mostly in John's NY apartment, and then in Central Park and a tiny cafe), it is surprisingly engaging and swift-moving.  You don't need to be a Beatles expert to appreciate this film, although some basic knowledge of Paul and (particularly) John's personal histories do make the story that much richer.The ending is bittersweet, but the only way the story really could have gone. As soon as I finished watching this movie the first time I knew I had to have it on DVD, as it's a story I'm going to want to revisit many times in the future, I'm sure.

727679,A3PBLIJGRM4ZJW,B00007ELFF,The Peripatetic Reader,"[1, 1]","This movie sneaks up on you. I started not really liking this movie, feeling they could have used better actors. Especially Harris' portrayal of John Lennon.  Didn't really sound like John. Sure, he did a very passable scouse accent, but his personification was nasaly without the high tenor of John's voice. Quinn as Paul as well could have been better I thought. Yeah, he had Paul's hair style, but facially does not particularly resemmble Paul at all. But as the movie progressed I was involved, engrossed, and then enthralled. Harris and Quinn I discovered, and you will too when you view the film, captured the essence of John and Paul as we know them and in all liklihood accurately captured in essence what went on during that fateful meeting.Quinn's personification of Lennon is dead on, as is Paul's interpretation of Paul, particularly how Harris captured Lennon's attitude and how Quinn captures Paul's mannerisms. More importantly, they both accurately reflected the bare inner essence of each musician: John, who displayed a hard exterior, but inside was a very vulnerable and wounded person; Paul, all sweetness and cutsiness outside, but inside hard as nails and solid as the Rock of Gibralter.The dialogue sounds authentic. As the disclaimer of the movie states, this is a piece of fiction. The only people who knows what was said and what went on during that meeting are John and Paul, and I don't think Paul will say. The dialogue rings true, however, because parts of the dialogue appear to be based on the public pronouncements of the characters made in interviews and other public statements. That's OK. The movie is utterly authentic in portraying the milieu of mid-70's America. The mythology of that meeting says that late that night they  decided to appear at Saturday Night Live, but as we all know, never did. The aftermath of that decision, their indecision, the stage fright, the doubts and finally, their decision not to appear, all seems very very authentic and totally believeable.The movie pays attention to detail. When Paul has first knocked on John's door he is still sporting an ascot worn in the beginning of the film. Realizing he is about to meet his old band-mate, he jerks the ascot off his neck. This little scene comes across as a completely human reaction. There are many little flourishes in this movie.I compare the movie to ""My Dinner with Andre."" You don't have to be a Beatle fan, a John fan, a Paul fan, or whatever, to enjoy this movie. It should be seen by all.",5,Simply amazing!,1295827200,"01 24, 2011",2011,2514,"['movie', 'up', 'started', 'not', 'really', 'liking', 'movie', 'feeling', 'could', 'have', 'used', 'better', 'actors', 'Especially', 'Harris', 'portrayal', 'John', 'Lennon', 'Did', ""n't"", 'really', 'sound', 'John', 'Sure', 'did', 'very', 'passable', 'scouse', 'accent', 'personification', 'was', 'nasaly', 'high', 'tenor', 'John', 'voice', 'as', 'Paul', 'well', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'better', 'thought', 'Yeah', 'had', 'Paul', 'hair', 'style', 'facially', 'not', 'particularly', 'resemmble', 'Paul', 'movie', 'progressed', 'was', 'involved', 'engrossed', 'then', 'enthralled', 'Harris', 'Quinn', 'discovered', 'will', 'too', 'when', 'view', 'film', 'captured', 'essence', 'John', 'Paul', 'know', 'liklihood', 'accurately', 'captured', 'essence', 'what', 'went', 'fateful', 'meeting.Quinn', 'personification', 'Lennon', 'dead', 'Paul', 'interpretation', 'Paul', 'particularly', 'how', 'Harris', 'captured', 'Lennon', 'attitude', 'how', 'Quinn', 'Paul', 'mannerisms', 'More', 'importantly', 'accurately', 'reflected', 'bare', 'inner', 'essence', 'musician', 'John', 'who', 'displayed', 'hard', 'exterior', 'inside', 'was', 'very', 'vulnerable', 'wounded', 'person', 'Paul', 'sweetness', 'cutsiness', 'inside', 'hard', 'nails', 'solid', 'Rock', 'Gibralter.The', 'dialogue', 'authentic', 'disclaimer', 'movie', 'piece', 'fiction', 'only', 'people', 'who', 'knows', 'what', 'was', 'said', 'went', 'meeting', 'are', 'John', 'Paul', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'Paul', 'will', 'say', 'dialogue', 'rings', 'true', 'however', 'parts', 'dialogue', 'appear', 'be', 'based', 'public', 'pronouncements', 'characters', 'made', 'interviews', 'other', 'public', 'statements', 'OK', 'movie', 'utterly', 'authentic', 'portraying', 'milieu', 'mid-70', 'America', 'mythology', 'meeting', 'late', 'night', 'decided', 'appear', 'Saturday', 'Night', 'Live', 'know', 'never', 'did', 'aftermath', 'decision', 'indecision', 'stage', 'fright', 'doubts', 'finally', 'decision', 'not', 'appear', 'very', 'very', 'authentic', 'totally', 'believeable.The', 'movie', 'attention', 'detail', 'When', 'Paul', 'first', 'knocked', 'John', 'door', 'still', 'sporting', 'ascot', 'worn', 'beginning', 'film', 'Realizing', 'meet', 'old', 'band-mate', 'ascot', 'neck', 'little', 'scene', 'across', 'completely', 'human', 'reaction', 'are', 'many', 'little', 'flourishes', 'movie.I', 'compare', 'movie', 'Dinner', 'Andre', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'be', 'Beatle', 'fan', 'John', 'fan', 'Paul', 'fan', 'whatever', 'enjoy', 'movie', 'should', 'be', 'seen']",Two of Us
