1038906,A2FTHCGH06O4Y5,B000LC52GY,Caraculiambro,"[0, 0]","Director Vincent Ward used to be the next up-and-coming thing in New Zealand, but it will be interesting to see if his career ever recovers from this bomb, reputed to have cost over 20 million to make but which only earned about 800,000 USD at the box office.It's not hard to see why it failed so miserably:1.  Ward, trained as a painter, does not have a worthy command of character.  His characters make decisions that he never upon or explored.  Morton's final decision in the movie seems unnecessary and almost spur-of-the moment.2.  The film is a downer throughout.  You don't feel satisfaction when the woman finds her son, when the war finishes, or when she makes her final decision.3.  Ward's view of the whites in New Zealand is absurdly one-sided.  They are utterly without any redeeming qualities, embodying greed, evil, rapaciousness, etc.  This is a little ridiculous.  After all, it was the eventual hegemony of the whites that put an end to the senseless, aeons-old fighting among the Maori tribes.  Not to mention much improved medical care and those awesome top hats!  In the end, the movie gives you every reason to hate white culture but no reasons to honor the Maori, other than the fact that they live is some very picturesque forests.4.  Morton -- an actress whose bona fides are beyond question -- delivers a terrible performance in this film, her worst, at least that I've seen. They say she was sick for weeks during the production, and it shows.  Pity that, but still . . .5.  I don't think they did such a great job on casting.  A lot of the Maoris had potbellies.  In the 1860's, they would have been a lot more wiry.",2,what a let-down,1314748800,"08 31, 2011",2011,1644,"['Director', 'Vincent', 'Ward', 'used', 'be', 'next', 'up-and-coming', 'thing', 'New', 'Zealand', 'will', 'be', 'interesting', 'see', 'career', 'ever', 'bomb', 'reputed', 'have', 'cost', '20', 'million', 'make', 'only', 'earned', '800,000', 'USD', 'box', 'office.It', 'not', 'hard', 'see', 'why', 'failed', 'so', 'miserably:1', 'Ward', 'trained', 'painter', 'not', 'have', 'worthy', 'command', 'character', 'characters', 'make', 'decisions', 'never', 'explored', 'Morton', 'final', 'decision', 'movie', 'unnecessary', 'almost', 'spur-of-the', 'moment.2', 'film', 'downer', 'do', ""n't"", 'feel', 'satisfaction', 'when', 'woman', 'son', 'when', 'war', 'finishes', 'when', 'final', 'decision.3', 'Ward', 'view', 'whites', 'New', 'Zealand', 'absurdly', 'one-sided', 'are', 'utterly', 'redeeming', 'qualities', 'embodying', 'greed', 'evil', 'rapaciousness', 'etc', 'little', 'ridiculous', 'was', 'eventual', 'hegemony', 'whites', 'put', 'end', 'senseless', 'aeons-old', 'fighting', 'Maori', 'tribes', 'Not', 'mention', 'much', 'improved', 'medical', 'care', 'awesome', 'top', 'hats', 'end', 'movie', 'reason', 'hate', 'white', 'culture', 'reasons', 'honor', 'Maori', 'other', 'fact', 'live', 'very', 'picturesque', 'forests.4', 'Morton', 'actress', 'bona', 'fides', 'are', 'question', 'terrible', 'performance', 'film', 'worst', 'least', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'say', 'was', 'sick', 'weeks', 'production', 'Pity', 'still', '.5', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'did', 'great', 'job', 'casting', 'lot', 'Maoris', 'had', 'potbellies', '1860', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'lot', 'more', 'wiry']",River Queen

1038908,A2IY9M330NKBW6,B000LC52GY,Eric Sanberg,"[0, 0]","Vincent Ward's films, though too often suffering under lousy scripts, have always been a feast for the eyes, and 'River Queen' is no exception. I always appreciate a good looking movie and they don't come much better looking than this. If location scouts received academy awards, this would be a shoe-in. It's gorgeous at every turn. Not a shot is wasted and the color palette is beautiful. Some have complained that the colors are over-saturated, and that may be true, but it didn't bother me in the least.Here's the scoop. New Zealand in the 1860s. The British are squeezing out the local Maori Indians. A young, British woman has a brief affair with a Maori and bares a child. Dad dies shortly afterward and a few years later granddad kidnaps the child and raises him as a Maori. Mom never gives up the search for him and when she finds him it brings light to a sticky situation involving loyalties both familial and social.This is a very good movie. Samantha Morton does a fine job as mom. Her face is great. She has to do the job without makeup and she has a childlike quality in her looks that allows her to pull it off. Kiefer Sutherland has a comparatively small roll and he does a decent job. Some complain about his having a lousy Irish accent but it didn't bother me. Cliff Curtis and Temeura Morrison turn in their usual good performances. The music is good though, at times, a bit reminiscent of Ennio Morricone. It's a good storyline. You feel the pull of loyalties between blood and society. Some of the Maroi want to fight. Some feel they need to make peace with whitey because he's a force to be dealt with. The son has been estranged from mom for enough time to feel more loyalty toward his people than to her . There is no easy way out of this. The costuming is also terrific. I always thought it bizarre how the Maori picked up on the western clothing and incorporated it with their own. They really push that point here.This is an epic. Maybe not as huge and sprawling as some but still of that ilk and worth your while. At 114 minutes I thought it was long enough. It didn't ware out it's welcome with me.If you're at all predisposed toward this type of film you will probably have a good time with it.",4,A Sticky Situation,1302048000,"04 6, 2011",2011,2224,"['Vincent', 'Ward', 'films', 'too', 'often', 'suffering', 'lousy', 'scripts', 'have', 'always', 'been', 'feast', 'eyes', ""'River"", 'Queen', 'exception', 'always', 'appreciate', 'good', 'looking', 'movie', 'do', ""n't"", 'come', 'much', 'better', 'looking', 'location', 'scouts', 'received', 'academy', 'awards', 'would', 'be', 'shoe-in', 'gorgeous', 'turn', 'Not', 'shot', 'wasted', 'color', 'palette', 'beautiful', 'have', 'complained', 'colors', 'are', 'over-saturated', 'may', 'be', 'true', 'did', ""n't"", 'bother', 'least.Here', 'scoop', 'New', 'Zealand', '1860s', 'British', 'are', 'squeezing', 'out', 'local', 'Maori', 'Indians', 'young', 'British', 'woman', 'brief', 'affair', 'Maori', 'child', 'Dad', 'shortly', 'afterward', 'few', 'years', 'later', 'granddad', 'kidnaps', 'child', 'Maori', 'Mom', 'never', 'up', 'search', 'when', 'light', 'sticky', 'situation', 'involving', 'loyalties', 'familial', 'social.This', 'very', 'good', 'movie', 'Samantha', 'Morton', 'fine', 'job', 'mom', 'face', 'great', 'do', 'job', 'makeup', 'childlike', 'quality', 'looks', 'pull', 'off', 'Kiefer', 'Sutherland', 'comparatively', 'small', 'roll', 'decent', 'job', 'complain', 'having', 'lousy', 'Irish', 'accent', 'did', ""n't"", 'bother', 'Cliff', 'Curtis', 'Temeura', 'Morrison', 'turn', 'usual', 'good', 'performances', 'music', 'good', 'times', 'bit', 'reminiscent', 'Ennio', 'Morricone', 'good', 'storyline', 'feel', 'pull', 'loyalties', 'blood', 'society', 'Maroi', 'want', 'fight', 'feel', 'need', 'make', 'peace', 'whitey', 'force', 'be', 'dealt', 'son', 'been', 'estranged', 'mom', 'enough', 'time', 'feel', 'more', 'loyalty', 'people', 'easy', 'way', 'costuming', 'also', 'terrific', 'always', 'thought', 'bizarre', 'how', 'Maori', 'picked', 'up', 'western', 'clothing', 'incorporated', 'own', 'really', 'push', 'point', 'here.This', 'epic', 'Maybe', 'not', 'huge', 'sprawling', 'still', 'ilk', 'while', '114', 'minutes', 'thought', 'was', 'long', 'enough', 'did', ""n't"", 'ware', 'welcome', 'me.If', ""'re"", 'predisposed', 'type', 'film', 'will', 'probably', 'have', 'good', 'time']",River Queen

1038912,A1IWWRZJOXOSYP,B000LC52GY,Lee Armstrong,"[0, 0]","""River Queen"" was a film I enjoyed despite the fact that it seemed to be pulling in several different directions that didn't always hang together.  The scenery of the boats winding up pristine rivers was breathtakingly beautiful.  However, these pastoral aspects were juxtaposed to the violent racial conflict between the Maori people and the White settlers.  Layered on top of this was a story about romance, motherhood, and family attachment and betrayal.  Vincent Ward directed.  Stephen Rea from ""Tara Road"" and ""V is for Vendetta"" plays the Irish father.  His strong-willed daughter Sarah played by Samatha Morton has a romance with a Maori who dies from illness.  She gives birth to Boy.  The boy's paternal grandfather steals the half-caste from her.  Morton has two Oscar nominations from ""In America"" & ""Sweet & Lowdown.""  She brings a strong quality performance to screen.  Cliff Curtis who is of Maori heritage plays the strong Wiremu who finds himself attracted to Sarah seven years later.  Kiefer Sutherland does a decent Irish accent as the soldier Doyle who has both heart and conscience.  The war scenes have a gritty realism as the viewer is torn between the two groups who fight.  Although the film didn't totally gel for me, I appreciated having seen it.  The scenery and the tale of racial conflict give it substance.

For its U.S. release 'River Queen' was stuck with a B-movie cover that camouflages the Grade A story within. Pitched as a Kiefer Sutherland vehicle by the jacket, it is easy to miss many of New Zealand's heaviest hitters beneath: Cliff Curtis, Temuera Morrison, and director Vincent Ward.  Samantha Morton is a strong lead, backed up by Stephen Rea and a creditable Irish accent by Sutherland, who plays Private Doyle.The story revolves around a mother (Morton) searching for her kidnapped child amidst the Maori warring against settlers during the 1860s.  The fern-choked muddiness of 'River Queen' evokes 'The Piano' but it is a story that goes down a river; a meandering, primeval tract of green reminiscent of 'Apocalypse Now' where Sarah meets her own Kurtz.  Cunning battle tactics developed by the outnumbered Maori are well depicted, and enemy musket shots are often little more than flashes lost amid the verdant undergrowth.Cultural references throughout the movie are globally relevant today; the moko form of tattoo and tikis are abundant, and there are several excellent hakas, the war dances that are now becoming popular with West Coast college football teams.  Maori spoken throughout is mostly translated, but sometimes input is demanded from the audience, such as a phrase made obvious by a hand gesture that goes untranslated.  The London Philharmonic provides a strong musical backdrop over which to tell the tale, and the only negative is a subtle current of unease that runs through 'River Queen', a vague sense of the production problems that always seem to plague visionary directors like Terry Gilliam, or in this case, Vincent Ward.",4,We All Go Down That River...,1227571200,"11 25, 2008",2008,2241,"['word', 'Cease', 'traveling', 'roads', 'Stop', 'forever', 'going', 'roads', 'lest', 'be', 'left', 'there', 'food', 'birds', 'air', 'beasts', 'field', 'have', 'eaten', 'European', 'beef', 'was', 'cooked', 'pot', 'women', 'children', 'partook', 'food', 'have', 'begun', 'eat', 'human', 'flesh', 'throat', 'constantly', 'open', 'flesh', 'man', 'shall', 'not', 'die', 'shall', 'not', 'die', 'When', 'death', 'dead', 'shall', 'be', 'alive', 'Temuera', 'Morrison', 'lines', 'equanimity', 'menace', 'uniquely', 'Te', 'Kai', 'Po', 'rebellious', 'Maori', 'chief', 'U.S.', 'release', ""'River"", 'Queen', 'was', 'stuck', 'B-movie', 'cover', 'Grade', 'A', 'story', 'Pitched', 'Kiefer', 'Sutherland', 'vehicle', 'jacket', 'easy', 'miss', 'many', 'New', 'Zealand', 'heaviest', 'hitters', 'beneath', 'Cliff', 'Curtis', 'Temuera', 'Morrison', 'director', 'Vincent', 'Ward', 'Samantha', 'Morton', 'strong', 'lead', 'backed', 'up', 'Stephen', 'Rea', 'creditable', 'Irish', 'accent', 'Sutherland', 'who', 'Private', 'Doyle.The', 'story', 'around', 'mother', 'Morton', 'searching', 'kidnapped', 'child', 'Maori', 'warring', 'settlers', '1860s', 'fern-choked', 'muddiness', ""'River"", 'Queen', 'evokes', ""'The"", 'Piano', 'story', 'down', 'river', 'meandering', 'primeval', 'tract', 'green', 'reminiscent', ""'Apocalypse"", 'Now', 'where', 'Sarah', 'own', 'Kurtz', 'Cunning', 'battle', 'tactics', 'developed', 'outnumbered', 'Maori', 'are', 'well', 'depicted', 'enemy', 'musket', 'shots', 'are', 'often', 'little', 'more', 'flashes', 'lost', 'verdant', 'undergrowth.Cultural', 'references', 'movie', 'are', 'globally', 'relevant', 'today', 'moko', 'form', 'tattoo', 'tikis', 'are', 'abundant', 'are', 'several', 'excellent', 'hakas', 'war', 'dances', 'are', 'now', 'becoming', 'popular', 'West', 'Coast', 'college', 'football', 'teams', 'Maori', 'spoken', 'mostly', 'translated', 'sometimes', 'input', 'demanded', 'audience', 'such', 'phrase', 'made', 'obvious', 'hand', 'gesture', 'untranslated', 'London', 'Philharmonic', 'strong', 'musical', 'backdrop', 'tell', 'tale', 'only', 'negative', 'subtle', 'current', 'unease', 'Queen', 'vague', 'sense', 'production', 'problems', 'always', 'seem', 'plague', 'visionary', 'directors', 'Terry', 'Gilliam', 'case', 'Vincent', 'Ward']",River Queen
