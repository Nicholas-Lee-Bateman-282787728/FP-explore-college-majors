662913,A1R602SXNGOMJ4,B00005LC5R,A. Vegan,"[0, 0]","This is perhaps, one of the most saddest films I have seen in my life.  Along with Schindler's List and The Piano, this is one of the best WWII/Holocaust drama.  Like many, I read this book as a young girl and was immediately saddened by Anne's story.  Seeing in graphic detail how a well-adjusted and endearing teenage girl deals with the horrors of persecution as her family is forced into hiding to avoid the Nazi terror cannot fail to engage the heart and mind. It shows Anne before the Nazi invasion of Holland as a bubbling girl eager for education and socialisation. Her indomitable spirit is well portrayed during her family's long months of hiding in the back of a factory in Amsterdam.  For me, the virtual incarceration of her family in the factory was very sad and thought-provoking. Taken from their normal lives and stripped of all those things they held dear, Anne's family strives to remain positive of better times ahead. How would we fare if required to give up all that we possessed and go into hiding for fear of our lives? A totally depressing thought, and yet that is what happened to Anne and her family.The later scenes, after the family was captured, humiliated, separated and sent to concentration camps, is simply tragic.  The concentration camp scenes are disturbing and Anne's gradual physical deterioration is depressing. It is not a movie to entertain but one to stir the emotions and the resolve to ensure that this sort of persecution and genocide is never again allowed to happen.I don't normally get teary when I watch movies but I actually cried heavily at the end.

Shindler's List and The Hiding Place are personal favorites.It took me two evenings to view the the first 1/2 or so of Anne Frank because it seemed to move ever so slowly. What I didn't realize at the time was that the film producers were apparently making sure that the characters were solidly etched in my mind because their later interactions would be critical to fully understanding and appreciating this film.From the time Anne and her family were finally discovered in their hide-out by the Nazis, the movie was not to be left unfinished again! This later part of the film, which I would estimate at 90-minutes, was probably the best 90-minutes of film I'd ever seen. Hannah Taylor Gordon's (Anne) and Ben Kingsley's (Anne's father, Otto) acting abilities, along with the great movie sets, make this film so realistic, gut-wrenching, and believable.Bottom line, one of the best films on the Holocaust you'll ever see. Easily stacks-up to Shindler's List.

It is touching to the human spirit and how Anne's soul never gave up until the very end. Hannah Taylor Gordon, who was in Jakob the Liar, turns in a superb performance as the Anne Frank. She is able to show us how Anne reacted to everyday life and the inevitable death of her sister, Margot. Ben Kingsley is amazing as Otto Frank, a quiet subdued man who loved his family and was the only one to survive.The most extraordinary part of this miniseries is the fact that the story keeps on going after they are taking to the Nazi concentration camp. We are seeing the unthinkable horrors and how fortunate we are to have not been a Jew prisoner in that camp.

Bullock,"[2, 3]","I watched the superb documentary on the Frank family and the Dutch resistance by author/director Branaugh called ""Anne Frank Remembered"" before this and can see how painfully accurate ""Anne Frank the Whole Story"" really is. Both are highly recommended to be viewed together as they are mutually reinforcing. Having just finished watching this film I am still too impassioned to be balanced, but will try. The acting is great. Anne transforms from an ugly duckling to a cherished princess. Otto Frank becomes the pillar of the world. Miep Gies brings us to our knees in respect for the ultimate womanhood. No loud in-your-face special effects are here; this is a British film in the finest tradition of understated power. Power that will have you jumping up from your seat trying to do anything to help these unfortunate people and their gallant protectors. You will pass through the emotions of sympathy, pathos, futility, anger, and cry to your God to alleviate their suffering and strike down their oppressors. To me, the equal of Schindler's List. Dear Anne was taken from the world at age 15. She wanted to create something lasting. And she did. Her diary has sold 30 million copies and has been translated into 60 languages.

This appears to be a lot longer than the first movie and goes into much more detail after the capture.  The harsh nature of the concentration camps after the capture makes this difficult to watch at times.  Kingsley is superb as the father, Otto Frank.  The girl playing Anne Frank is absolutely wonderful too and even looks somewhat like Anne Frank's pictures.  All the cast was excellent.  I liked the original movie, but this is so much better.  I don't know how much was factual, but having seen the Anne Frank house in Amsterdam, I have to say that they really did seem to accurately depict what it looked like; probably made a replica or even possibly filmed it there on site.  The only inaccuracy that I picked up was that they showed who betrayed the Franks; however, that has never been determined with any certainty.  It is a mystery to this day.  The movie feels like it drags on and on and it is a bit slow in places.  It is probably best watched in two parts.  In spite of any minor shortcomings, this is a 5-star movie.  Bring your box of hankies.  It is highly emotional and very sad at the end.  Holocaust deniers should be forced to sit through this movie over and over again, as well as visit some of the still remaining camps.  I visited Dachau last year and seeing it has a profound impact on a person.  Anne Frank reminds us how brutal things can be for the innocent in a war.  I wouldn't watch this with sensitive young children, as it might be too upsetting for them.  I think you will be moved by this film and it should be a part of everyone's film library.

662920,A26D5IRV2OLU4B,B00005LC5R,D. Munro,"[5, 5]","This movie was extremely well done from beginning to end.  Sir Ben Kingsley and Hannah Gordon were splendid in their roles.The movie progresses quite well.  We see Anne living a somewhat normal life -- living in a comfortable home, first crush, friends, school -- despite her family's Jewish faith.  Slowly, things are being taken away from them ... Anne has to leave her regular school and go to a Jewish school, Anne can no longer be friends with another girl because the other girl's Aryan family is anti-semitic, and now it is mandatory that all Jews wear the Star of David on their clothing.  And quite often, Jews are being rounded up and sent away.  A powerful scene is one in which Anne's teacher starts to sob and can no longer write on the chalkboard -- his wife was just taken away to a labor camp.  One day, the Franks receive a summons for Anne's sister Margot, and Otto decides that his family will hide.  Anne must now leave her home, school, pet, and friends in order to survive The Holocaust.The Franks offer aid to a few select people -- the Van Pels family (one of which is a young boy a couple of years older than Anne, Peter), and Mr. Pfeffer (a friend of the family), rounding out the whole party to eight people.We see the time pass in The Annex, and tensions rise amongst the adults.  Personalities clash, and mingle as Peter and Anne fall in love.  Everything is portrayed very believably as Anne, a naive young girl at first, goes from hating Peter to caring for him very much.  Miep and Jans are portrayed as the caring people they were described as being in real life.Inevitably, the SS arrives for the Frank family based on an anonymous tip.  There is a moment where the SS officer spots Otto's trunk and discovers that Otto was an officer for Germany in WWI.  The SS officer salutes Otto out of respect and allows Otto more time to pack, inquiring why he didn't register as a veteran so that he could have received preferable treatment.  Otto says nothing, but looks at his family ... the meaning is understood.  They are forcibly removed from the Annex and sent to a labor camp, where they are treated as criminals because they hid. Anne assists the teacher in the labor camp school by telling stories to the children.  In one scene, the teacher gives all the children their report cards before they board a train that is supposedly going to another labor camp.  Given  the age of these young children, it is inevitable they are headed to an extermination camp ... but the teacher kindly asks them to make sure they give their report cards to their next teacher, to spare the children any fear. A sad scene.The Franks end up at Auschwitz-Birkenau ... the final stop for many Jews.  There, the party of eight is divided forever -- with the men going one way, the women another.  Margot and Anne end up at Bergen-Belsen, a camp known for its horrible conditions: filth, squalor, starvation, and sickness.  We see Anne suffer,  her naive beliefs she held at the beginning gone forever as she witnesses extreme desperation and death.  Soon, she herself becomes desperate in order to survive and protect her sister.  She learns of her mother's death from Mrs. Van Pels.At the very end, we see Otto arrive at a Red Cross location, desperate for any news on his family.  He is informed by a Bergen-Belsen survivor of their fate.  He arrives at the office to inform Miep and gives a description of the destinies of the other occupants of the Annex ... in a voice clearly exhausted with grief and shock.  He is the only survivor.  At a historical moment, Miep presents him with the pages to Anne's diary ....The two main characters, really, are Otto and Anne.  Pim and Anne adored each other ... and when they are torn out of each other's arms it's the other they cry out for.  At the end, Otto's love for Anne is what leads to the diary's being published.

662923,A3FHSLWEMH7JD8,B00005LC5R,"Elizabeth G. Melillo ""gloriana""","[1, 1]","The combination of outstanding acting and material from many sources provides a moving, sometimes horrifying, often warm picture of not only Anne Frank but the love and dedication which sustained many during the horrors of the Holocaust. Normally, the very thought of the time and place is enough to make one shudder, and to envision a world of pure evil and hatred. Though there is no gloss on that aspect, and the concentration camp scenes do not minimise the horror, the mutual caring of those in the Annexe and those who assist them (despite huge danger) provides a balance which can restore a picture of the essential goodness of human nature which even the worst conditions do not always destroy.Though I have not read the particular biography on which this adaptation is based, I had previously seen interviews with those who knew Anne and her family, and memories of theirs are cleverly interwoven into the early sequences. Anne's portrait is frank and largely amusing, and the subtle recognition of how anti-Jewish measures in Amsterdam slowly stripped Jews of rights is well depicted. The gradual restrictions, at first bothersome but not horrid, are a keen reminder both of how respected neighbours can be reduced to outcasts, and, tellingly, of how those such as Otto Frank could initially have felt safe in Amsterdam.Seeing Anne with friends, at school, in her lovely flat, and at Otto's office makes the impact of the hiding and constant fright understandable - I felt claustrophobic and trapped just watching the relatively peaceful days in the Annexe. Anne's reflections, based on her diary, will strike a chord with anyone. The hatred surrounding her from the invaders is clear, but the other struggles are those all of us face as we come to maturity, and the limited picture one normally could have from having 'seen' only the time in hiding can turn Anne into a monument rather than a cheeky, inspired, boy obsessed, intelligent teenager.There are times when even brief lines capture a great deal. For example, when Otto Frank, in response to Anne's overall bitterness towards all Germans, reminds her both that the Franks are German and that protector Miep is Austrian (just like Hitler), it is a strong reminder of how coming to maturity means broadening perspective.The scenes in the concentration camp do not spare the viewer the horror of the reality. Anne's screaming for her father; the tragic sequence when women, stripped of clothes and hair, try to cover themselves to maintain dignity; the utter cruelty of the female who tells Anne the men are already gassed as she tattoos Anne's arm with her identification number, all would cause one to wonder what sort of hatred could lead to so degrading others, even before we see or hear of anyone's dying. Camera angles which capture the chimneys of Auschwitz show us, all too well, the awareness of death with which the prisoners lived at each moment.I believe that this film is enriching and enlightening, however painful the camp sequences are (and well they should be). My only caution for classroom use is that students need to have previous awareness of the history of the era, and have already braced themselves for scenes of the horror of the camps. Those who have only small familiarity with Anne's diary, which naturally chronicles no nightmarish events, could be very shocked otherwise.",5,"Powerful, multi dimensional portrait",1218499200,"08 12, 2008",2008,3370,"['combination', 'outstanding', 'acting', 'material', 'many', 'sources', 'moving', 'sometimes', 'horrifying', 'often', 'warm', 'picture', 'not', 'only', 'Anne', 'Frank', 'love', 'dedication', 'sustained', 'many', 'horrors', 'Holocaust', 'Normally', 'very', 'thought', 'time', 'place', 'enough', 'make', 'one', 'shudder', 'envision', 'world', 'pure', 'evil', 'hatred', 'gloss', 'aspect', 'concentration', 'camp', 'scenes', 'do', 'not', 'minimise', 'horror', 'mutual', 'caring', 'Annexe', 'who', 'assist', 'huge', 'danger', 'balance', 'can', 'restore', 'picture', 'essential', 'goodness', 'human', 'nature', 'even', 'worst', 'conditions', 'do', 'not', 'always', 'have', 'not', 'read', 'particular', 'biography', 'adaptation', 'based', 'had', 'previously', 'seen', 'interviews', 'who', 'knew', 'Anne', 'family', 'memories', 'theirs', 'are', 'cleverly', 'interwoven', 'early', 'sequences', 'Anne', 'portrait', 'frank', 'largely', 'amusing', 'subtle', 'recognition', 'how', 'anti-Jewish', 'measures', 'Amsterdam', 'slowly', 'stripped', 'Jews', 'rights', 'well', 'depicted', 'gradual', 'restrictions', 'first', 'bothersome', 'not', 'horrid', 'are', 'keen', 'reminder', 'how', 'respected', 'neighbours', 'can', 'be', 'reduced', 'outcasts', 'tellingly', 'how', 'such', 'Otto', 'Frank', 'could', 'initially', 'have', 'felt', 'safe', 'Amsterdam.Seeing', 'Anne', 'friends', 'school', 'lovely', 'flat', 'Otto', 'office', 'impact', 'hiding', 'constant', 'fright', 'understandable', 'felt', 'claustrophobic', 'trapped', 'just', 'watching', 'relatively', 'peaceful', 'days', 'Annexe', 'Anne', 'reflections', 'based', 'diary', 'will', 'strike', 'chord', 'anyone', 'hatred', 'surrounding', 'invaders', 'clear', 'other', 'struggles', 'are', 'face', 'come', 'maturity', 'limited', 'picture', 'one', 'normally', 'could', 'have', 'having', ""'seen"", 'only', 'time', 'hiding', 'can', 'turn', 'Anne', 'monument', 'rather', 'cheeky', 'inspired', 'boy', 'obsessed', 'intelligent', 'are', 'times', 'when', 'even', 'brief', 'lines', 'capture', 'great', 'deal', 'example', 'when', 'Otto', 'Frank', 'response', 'Anne', 'overall', 'bitterness', 'Germans', 'both', 'Franks', 'are', 'German', 'protector', 'Miep', 'Austrian', 'just', 'Hitler', 'strong', 'reminder', 'how', 'coming', 'maturity', 'means', 'broadening', 'perspective.The', 'scenes', 'concentration', 'camp', 'do', 'not', 'spare', 'viewer', 'horror', 'reality', 'Anne', 'screaming', 'father', 'tragic', 'sequence', 'when', 'women', 'stripped', 'clothes', 'hair', 'try', 'cover', 'maintain', 'dignity', 'utter', 'cruelty', 'female', 'who', 'Anne', 'men', 'are', 'already', 'gassed', 'tattoos', 'Anne', 'arm', 'identification', 'number', 'would', 'cause', 'one', 'wonder', 'what', 'sort', 'hatred', 'could', 'lead', 'so', 'degrading', 'others', 'even', 'see', 'hear', 'anyone', 'dying', 'Camera', 'capture', 'chimneys', 'Auschwitz', 'show', 'too', 'well', 'awareness', 'death', 'prisoners', 'lived', 'moment.I', 'believe', 'film', 'enriching', 'enlightening', 'however', 'painful', 'camp', 'sequences', 'are', 'well', 'should', 'be', 'only', 'caution', 'classroom', 'use', 'students', 'need', 'have', 'previous', 'awareness', 'history', 'era', 'have', 'already', 'braced', 'scenes', 'horror', 'camps', 'who', 'have', 'only', 'small', 'familiarity', 'Anne', 'diary', 'naturally', 'nightmarish', 'events', 'could', 'be', 'very', 'shocked', 'otherwise']",Anne Frank - The Whole Story

662930,AL5OEDM8TPTKV,B00005LC5R,James Hiller,"[186, 192]","As i write this review, this film is just finishing up, and I must say, this is one of the most moving accounts of Anne Frank that I've seen to date. We all know the story of Anne Frank, how it started, and what a complete tragic end of her life; and more importantly, what hope she brought to the world that killed her. This film is a remarkable, incredible retelling of the life of Anne Frank.The reasons why this film soars, aboslutely soars, are numerous. First, the film tells the complete story, from before the Franks hid in the Annex, until her final days in the concentration camp. Whereas some films tend to linger solely on Anne's days in the Annex, this wider focus gives us the larger picture. Anne's time in captivity is heart wrenching; we have fallen in love with the tempestuous, darling girl and to see her solely fade away is devastating. It serves as a testament both to the millions lost, and the one girl that would write a book to change the world.Secondly, the performances in this movie are amazing. Ben Kingsley and Brenda Blethyn lend their star-stature names to this project, and turn in performances that are real and dignified. Favorite Lili Taylor, who is one of America's most talented actressses, gives a quiet, powerful performance as Miep Gies. It's Hannah Taylor Gorden, as Anne, brings Anne to life with complexity and grace. Gordon honors Anne in every scene, never deifying the girl, but making her real, human. She even writes the way Anne did, holding the pen as Anne would have held it. That attention to detail does not go unnoticed by those of us who love Anne. It was a perfect match of actress and role.Third, this film is visually beautiful. Often, you expect a &quot;lower&quot; standard of technical excellence in a television film. Rightfully so, ABC and the director, Robert Dornhelm, give this film a professional style. There are several scenes where you are just in awe, apart from the incredible story.It was sad for me to learn that this film was not endorsed by the Anne Frank Foundation, because the film was based on a biography not approved by the foundation. Whereas I think its important to have the Foundation so Anne's life can be told in a honest way, they should have seen the film before making a judgment. This movie is a beautiful testament to a beautiful life, and it should be free from any political wranglings like this.By the final scene, when Miep gives Otto Frank his daughter's diary, and he travels back into the Annex to look at it, my heart was breaking. Anne didn't live to see the effect she'd have on the world, but I think for all of us, we have adopted Anne as our own daughter or sister. She belongs to the world now, and we are responsible to take care of her, to make sure her story is told generation after generation, to honor her life by ensuring nothing like this ever happens in history again.",5,Our Anne,1082246400,"04 18, 2004",2004,2886,"['i', 'write', 'review', 'film', 'just', 'finishing', 'up', 'must', 'say', 'one', 'most', 'moving', 'accounts', 'Anne', 'Frank', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'date', 'know', 'story', 'Anne', 'Frank', 'how', 'started', 'what', 'complete', 'tragic', 'end', 'life', 'more', 'importantly', 'what', 'hope', 'brought', 'world', 'killed', 'film', 'remarkable', 'incredible', 'retelling', 'life', 'Anne', 'Frank.The', 'reasons', 'why', 'film', 'soars', 'aboslutely', 'soars', 'are', 'numerous', 'First', 'film', 'complete', 'story', 'Franks', 'hid', 'Annex', 'final', 'days', 'concentration', 'camp', 'films', 'tend', 'linger', 'solely', 'Anne', 'days', 'Annex', 'wider', 'focus', 'larger', 'picture', 'Anne', 'time', 'captivity', 'heart', 'wrenching', 'have', 'fallen', 'love', 'tempestuous', 'darling', 'girl', 'see', 'solely', 'fade', 'away', 'devastating', 'testament', 'millions', 'lost', 'one', 'girl', 'would', 'write', 'book', 'change', 'world.Secondly', 'performances', 'movie', 'are', 'amazing', 'Ben', 'Kingsley', 'Brenda', 'Blethyn', 'lend', 'star-stature', 'names', 'project', 'turn', 'performances', 'are', 'real', 'dignified', 'Favorite', 'Lili', 'Taylor', 'who', 'one', 'America', 'most', 'talented', 'actressses', 'quiet', 'powerful', 'performance', 'Miep', 'Gies', 'Hannah', 'Taylor', 'Gorden', 'Anne', 'Anne', 'life', 'complexity', 'grace', 'Gordon', 'honors', 'Anne', 'scene', 'never', 'deifying', 'girl', 'making', 'real', 'human', 'even', 'way', 'Anne', 'did', 'holding', 'pen', 'Anne', 'would', 'have', 'held', 'attention', 'detail', 'not', 'go', 'unnoticed', 'who', 'love', 'Anne', 'was', 'perfect', 'match', 'actress', 'role.Third', 'film', 'visually', 'beautiful', 'Often', 'expect', 'quot', 'lower', 'quot', 'standard', 'technical', 'excellence', 'television', 'film', 'Rightfully', 'so', 'ABC', 'director', 'Robert', 'Dornhelm', 'give', 'film', 'professional', 'style', 'are', 'several', 'scenes', 'where', 'are', 'just', 'awe', 'apart', 'incredible', 'story.It', 'was', 'sad', 'learn', 'film', 'was', 'not', 'endorsed', 'Anne', 'Frank', 'Foundation', 'film', 'was', 'based', 'biography', 'not', 'approved', 'foundation', 'think', 'important', 'have', 'Foundation', 'Anne', 'life', 'can', 'be', 'told', 'honest', 'way', 'should', 'have', 'seen', 'film', 'making', 'judgment', 'movie', 'beautiful', 'testament', 'beautiful', 'life', 'should', 'be', 'free', 'political', 'wranglings', 'this.By', 'final', 'scene', 'when', 'Miep', 'Otto', 'Frank', 'daughter', 'diary', 'back', 'Annex', 'look', 'heart', 'was', 'breaking', 'Anne', 'did', ""n't"", 'live', 'see', 'effect', ""'d"", 'have', 'world', 'think', 'have', 'adopted', 'Anne', 'own', 'daughter', 'sister', 'world', 'now', 'are', 'responsible', 'take', 'care', 'make', 'sure', 'story', 'told', 'generation', 'generation', 'honor', 'life', 'ensuring', 'nothing', 'ever', 'history', 'again']",Anne Frank - The Whole Story

I have seen two different version of The Diary of Anne Frank, the 1950'ns version with Millie Perkins, and the 1980 version withe Melissa Gilbert, as well as a local stage production. However, while I watched this, I felt like I was part of their world. I was able to see how carefree Anne was, hanging out with her friends, going to school, just being an every day schoolgirl. The movie is a little over three hours, and divided roughly into three parts, pre-hiding, during hiding, and post-hiding. While all other versions begin the movie with the family going into the secret Annex, and ending with the Nazi's finding them, this went above and beyond. I will not deny the fact that during the whole last hour, I was crying. To see what those poor people went through, just because they were Jewish. It is a movie every person should see. The character of Anne was shown how Anne herself described herself to be, talkative, annoying, and bratty. My boyfriend whom I watched it with kept repeating, she is so annoying.

The actors & actresses of ALL the other characters -- both the main characters (Edith Frank, Margot Frank, the van Pels family [Auguste, Hermann & Peter van Pels], Fritz Pfeffer) as well as the supporting characters (Bep Voskuijl, Victor Kugler, Johannes Kleiman, Charlotta Kaletta, Jacqueline van Maarsen, the Goslar family [Hans, Ruth, Hannah & Gabi Goslar], Janny Brandes & her sister Lientje, etc.) are also ALL just PERFECT in their respective roles!Best of all, UNLIKE the other Anne Frank movies (as well as the theatrical plays) this film goes WAY, WAY BEYOND those in its exploration of Anne and her life, and surpasses what everyone already knows about about the famous young diarist.This film NOT ONLY shows Anne's life during the 25 months she spent hiding in the ""Secret Annexe"" (like all the other films & plays do) but it goes EVEN DEEPER not only by showing her life in the months/years before going into hiding, but also by following Anne & the other residents of the ""Secret Annexe"" to the concentration camps/death camps after they were betrayed by an unknown individual (though this film shows one speculation -- that it was Lena van Bladeren-Hartog, the building's cleaning-woman & wife of Lammert Hartog, the warehouse foreman) and captured by the Nazis.Anne Frank - The Whole Storyis a touching, poignant, and ultimately HEARTBREAKING film, (because of course, most everyone ALREADY KNOWS how the story of Anne Frank ends -- with Anne dying a miserable & lonely death of typhus at the age of 15 at the Bergen-Belsen concentration camp in Germany, and saddest of all, just a couple weeks before the camp was liberated) and its a real shame that the official Anne Frank Foundation refused to officially authorize this movie (which meant that the film was unable to quote Anne or use any of her actual words from the diary) because it is the BEST of all the Anne Frank movies out there!If you were to see ONE movie about Anne Frank, it should be THIS movie --Anne Frank -

662936,AP3SD9K0Q3QAC,B00005LC5R,"L. S. Reed ""roadrunner""","[1, 1]","This is a Disney version of an Anne Frank biography. But it's a totally straight telling -- not ""Disney-fied"" in the slightest. It tells the familiar story of Anne's life as covered by the diary (a tiny bit of ""normal"" life but primarily the life of her, her family, and four other people for two years while they were hidden in an apartment above Mr. Frank's offices). But it also gives insights into things that the diary doesn't cover, including going's on in the outside world while the Franks were in the hideaway, speculation about who turned them in, and, most movingly, the story of what happened to Anne and her fellow Annex residents after they were captured.Frankly, if your primary interest is the part of the story that takes place inside the Annex, I think I'd recommend the BBC/Masterpiece Theater version (which is based on Anne's diary). While the casting in the Disney version is good, I thought the characters were a little stronger in the BBC version.But if you want to get the broader context, this is the one for you. The speculations about who betrayed them are interesting. (Suspicion fell on three people after the war but the case was never proven against any of them.) You also get more information in this movie about what was going on in the outside lives of Miep and their other ""helpers,"" and a few updates on what was happening with Anne's friends.But the real strength of this movie is the part of the story that happens after their arrest. The stories of life in the camps focuses on Anne, her sister, and mother, and it's one of the most moving pieces of film-making I've ever seen.

This movie left me with no such comfort. I read the Diary about two years ago, and it made me think about how this girl changed the world...and how similar she was to many people I know now. A normal teenager. I thought I would watch this movie when it was on TV, because the book was so spectacular. When I started watching, I got caught up in it, as though I was watching this wonderful documentary. I kept hoping that it wasn't true...that they would change the ending. At 9 o clock the next night, I was a totally different person. I saw the brutality and cruelty inflicted on this smart, kind, and powerful girl. She had mature thoughts which she wrote in her diary about love, life and the world around her. She was treated as an object instead of a person. Taken away from everything which she cared about...especially her father. And she died, 2 weeks before her camp was freed. And as I sat there, watching Ben Kingsley (the only actor who surpassed the power of the actress playing Anne) walk down the streets of Amsterdam after the war, the same street I had seen the night before. Anne was sauntering down the lovely walk way. The streets she peeked at through the window in the secret attic. I started to cry. I couldn't help it. It was just such an injustice that this person had to face this. He was so kind...such a good father and strong of character. Kingsley's powerful eyes made mine cringe with an odd pain. It was so hard to sit through this film of awesome standards. It took you to the places after the diary ends...to the places that we have before only imagined before shutting our eyes and telling ourselves that it wasn't like that. It showed the brutality that we couldn't of imagined. The symbolism was powerful..the reality painful. How could someone inflict such pain on others. Strip them of dignity and kill them? Innocent children, women and men. Take a whole community and lower the population of them by the millions. Ben Kingsley, a normally stunning actor was stunning and ominous all at the same time...such a gentle creature of a character he played that it was so obvious the pain he would have to accept.This movie takes the startlingly poetic diary of a girl, and turns it into a startling portrail of hatred.

This story was about a real girl - Anne Frank - who was a Jewish girl growing up during the Holocaust, one of the most terrible, unthinkable tragedies in history. It was very accurate, considering the fact that I read Melissa Miller's novel right after viewing the film. This is a film Disney and ABC should be proud of! Everyone must see this film...it will change your life and way of thinking forever! The DVD or VHS must be on the shelf in every family's house. The acting performances are absolutely superb and some of the best I've ever seen. Hannah Taylor-Gordon is inspirational and gives an Oscar-winning performance, forget the Emmy Award! If only this had been shown in the theaters. Taylor-Gordon is exactly how I'd picture Anne Frank to be on screen. She is a true teen idol for teenage girls out there - forget those teen &quot;Pop princesses&quot;...they don't even come close to Hannah Taylor-Gordon! Ben Kingsley is in his best performance yet. And Lili Taylor...what more can I say about her? She is one of those rare, extremely talented actresses, but so underrated. She also deserves an Emmy! The whole cast is superb, like I said before. Oh, and also, to that reviewer who was wondering who played Peter van Pels, it's Nick Audsley. Another truly amazing actor. And I also agree that his chemistry with Hannah Taylor-Gordon in the film was perfect! This is a film of horrifying reality. It is also one of those rare films that made me cry at the ending. I cannot wait to be able to buy this DVD. If I could give ANNE FRANK more than 5 stars, I definitely would. This film may be too tense for very young viewers, so I suggest to parents that they the be cautious of the warnings before letting their children watch the film. If you are over the age of twelve, then I strongly recommend you see ANNK FRANK - THE WHOLE STORY...it goes beyond the treasured, best-selling novel we all know of and is absolutely a beautiful film!",5,Anne Frank - a film to remember.,1004140800,"10 27, 2001",2001,2129,"['loved', 'film', 'ANNE', 'FRANK', 'WHOLE', 'STORY', 'so', 'much', 'saw', 'when', 'aired', 'ABC', 'thought', 'was', 'one', 'most', 'beautiful', 'heartwarming', 'pieces', 'filmmaking', 'movie', 'history', 'story', 'was', 'real', 'girl', 'Anne', 'Frank', 'who', 'was', 'Jewish', 'girl', 'growing', 'up', 'Holocaust', 'one', 'most', 'terrible', 'unthinkable', 'tragedies', 'history', 'was', 'very', 'accurate', 'considering', 'fact', 'read', 'Melissa', 'Miller', 'novel', 'right', 'viewing', 'film', 'film', 'Disney', 'ABC', 'should', 'be', 'proud', 'Everyone', 'must', 'see', 'film', 'will', 'change', 'life', 'way', 'thinking', 'forever', 'DVD', 'VHS', 'must', 'be', 'shelf', 'family', 'house', 'acting', 'performances', 'are', 'absolutely', 'superb', 'best', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'seen', 'Hannah', 'Taylor-Gordon', 'inspirational', 'Oscar-winning', 'performance', 'forget', 'Emmy', 'Award', 'only', 'had', 'been', 'shown', 'theaters', 'Taylor-Gordon', 'exactly', 'how', ""'d"", 'picture', 'Anne', 'Frank', 'be', 'screen', 'true', 'teen', 'idol', 'teenage', 'girls', 'out', 'there', 'forget', 'teen', 'quot', 'Pop', 'quot', 'do', ""n't"", 'even', 'come', 'close', 'Hannah', 'Taylor-Gordon', 'Ben', 'Kingsley', 'best', 'performance', 'yet', 'Lili', 'Taylor', 'what', 'more', 'can', 'say', 'one', 'rare', 'extremely', 'talented', 'actresses', 'so', 'underrated', 'also', 'Emmy', 'whole', 'cast', 'superb', 'said', 'Oh', 'also', 'reviewer', 'who', 'was', 'wondering', 'who', 'played', 'Peter', 'van', 'Pels', 'Nick', 'Audsley', 'truly', 'amazing', 'actor', 'also', 'agree', 'chemistry', 'Hannah', 'Taylor-Gordon', 'film', 'was', 'perfect', 'film', 'horrifying', 'reality', 'also', 'one', 'rare', 'films', 'made', 'cry', 'ending', 'can', 'not', 'wait', 'be', 'able', 'buy', 'DVD', 'could', 'give', 'ANNE', 'FRANK', 'more', '5', 'stars', 'definitely', 'would', 'film', 'may', 'be', 'too', 'tense', 'very', 'young', 'viewers', 'suggest', 'parents', 'be', 'cautious', 'warnings', 'letting', 'children', 'watch', 'film', 'are', 'age', 'twelve', 'then', 'strongly', 'recommend', 'see', 'ANNK', 'FRANK', 'WHOLE', 'STORY', 'treasured', 'best-selling', 'novel', 'know', 'absolutely', 'beautiful', 'film']",Anne Frank - The Whole Story

It has always been a very moving story to me.  It has inspired me to read volumes about others who were in the same or worse situations.  I have seen other movies about her, but this was by far the best portrayal that I have ever seen.  Hannah Taylor-Gordon was Anne Frank to me. Every character that was selected to play in this movie was excellent.  As to the scenes in the concentration camps, I think it is important to educate people about what happened.  Some people say that it is a little much, but you know what, you can't change history.  That is how it happened, horrible as it is to watch.  Many of the survivors are beginning to die and if people aren't willing to pick up a book and read about it, I think the best way to educate people is to show them.

662948,A2VP7JOT3K7PFM,B00005LC5R,"Stephen Pletko ""Uncle Stevie""","[18, 19]","+++++At the very end of this movie we are presented with the following words:""One and a half million children were murdered in the genocide the Nazis called `The Final Solution.'  Anne Frank's story is only one of them.""  (The Nazis' final solution was to exterminate the Jews.)And what a story it is!  The story is well told through this movie.At the beginning of this movie we are presented with the following words (information in parentheses is my own additional information):(i) This movie is based on the book by Melissa Muller called ""Anne Frank: A Biography"" (1998) as well as research and interviews by an independent researcher.  (I have not read this book but from what I have read, it is excellently researched.)(ii) Some scenes can also be found in ""Anne Frank: The Diary of a Young Girl.""  Note that the actual words from the diary were not used.  (The first diary entry is for mid-June, 1942 and the last one is dated (August 1, 1944).  It is also helpful to know that Anne was born June 12, 1929.)(iii) There are realistic depictions of concentration camp life--including brief nudity.The actual movie itself can be divided into four parts:(1) The time before the German-Jewish Anne Frank (Hannah Taylor-Gordon) and her family go into hiding.  The movie begins Feb., 1939 in Amsterdam, Holland.  Some of this is based on the ten diary entries Anne made before she went into hiding.  (This part of the movie lasts about 55 minutes.)(2) The time the Frank family of four, another family of three, and an elderly dentist went into hiding in the ""het achterbuis"" which, loosely translated, means ""secret annex"" of an old three-story building.  This part of the movie begins in mid-Nov., 1942 when the elderly dentist joins the two families that have been hiding since early July, 1942.  We are also introduced to the four people who aided the hiding group of eight especially a young women named Miep (Lili Taylor).  There is also some speculation of exactly who betrayed the hiding group.  (Note that this has never been proven.)  This part ends with the group of eight being discovered by the Nazis secret police (Gestapo) and being taken away on Aug. 4, 1944.  (Lasts for about 75 minutes.)(3) This part of the movie portrays what happened to Anne after the group was discovered.  It ends with the viewer being taken to Amsterdam in 1945, one month after the German surrender. (Lasts about 55 minutes.)(4) The movie ends with the printed word.  In this part we get snippets of important printed information.  For example:""In 1957, Otto Frank [Anne's father, played in the movie by Ben Kingsley] established the Anne Frank Foundation, working to educate young people against intolerance and discrimination.""Another example is the quoted information that begins this review.  (Lasts about 3 minutes.)What makes this movie so powerful is the contrasts we see in each part.  Part one presents the free, happy Anne; part two, the hiding, hoping Anne; and part three, the fearful, prisoner Anne.Note that this movie has not been sanctioned by the Anne Frank Foundation.  Personally, I can't understand why because it seems to follow rather closely everything I've read.The acting in this movie is fantastic.  Kudos should go to Hannah Taylor-Gordon who essentially carries the movie as Anne.The background music adds to each scene and even the cinematography is well done.If you haven't actually read Anne's diary, I urge you to do so.  I recommend the 1993 Bantam edition that not only contains the actual diary but also information that puts Anne's diary in historical context and, as well, has pictures that illuminate the diary.Finally, the DVD itself is perfect in picture and sound quality.  There are no extras.In conclusion, this is a powerful movie, a worthy companion to Anne Frank's diary!!(2001;  3 hr, 10 min;  made for TV;  full screen;  22 scenes)+++++",5,The perfect companion to Anne Frank's diary!!!,1141344000,"03 3, 2006",2006,3876,"['very', 'end', 'movie', 'are', 'presented', 'following', 'words', 'One', 'half', 'million', 'children', 'were', 'murdered', 'genocide', 'Nazis', 'called', 'Final', 'Solution', 'Anne', 'Frank', 'story', 'only', 'one', 'Nazis', 'final', 'solution', 'was', 'exterminate', 'Jews', 'what', 'story', 'story', 'well', 'told', 'beginning', 'movie', 'are', 'presented', 'following', 'words', 'information', 'parentheses', 'own', 'additional', 'information', 'i', 'movie', 'based', 'book', 'Melissa', 'Muller', 'called', 'Anne', 'Frank', 'Biography', '1998', 'as', 'well', 'research', 'interviews', 'independent', 'researcher', 'have', 'not', 'read', 'book', 'what', 'have', 'read', 'excellently', 'researched', 'ii', 'scenes', 'can', 'also', 'be', 'found', 'Anne', 'Frank', 'Diary', 'Young', 'Girl', 'Note', 'actual', 'words', 'diary', 'were', 'not', 'used', 'first', 'diary', 'entry', 'mid-June', '1942', 'last', 'one', 'dated', 'August', '1', '1944', 'also', 'helpful', 'know', 'Anne', 'was', 'born', 'June', '12', '1929', 'iii', 'are', 'realistic', 'depictions', 'concentration', 'camp', 'life', 'including', 'brief', 'nudity.The', 'actual', 'movie', 'can', 'be', 'divided', 'four', 'parts', '1', 'time', 'German-Jewish', 'Anne', 'Frank', 'Hannah', 'Taylor-Gordon', 'family', 'go', 'hiding', 'movie', 'Feb.', '1939', 'Amsterdam', 'Holland', 'based', 'ten', 'diary', 'entries', 'Anne', 'made', 'went', 'hiding', 'part', 'movie', '55', 'minutes', '2', 'time', 'Frank', 'family', 'four', 'family', 'three', 'elderly', 'dentist', 'went', 'hiding', 'het', 'achterbuis', 'loosely', 'translated', 'secret', 'annex', 'old', 'three-story', 'building', 'part', 'movie', 'mid-Nov.', '1942', 'when', 'elderly', 'dentist', 'two', 'families', 'have', 'been', 'hiding', 'early', 'July', '1942', 'are', 'also', 'introduced', 'four', 'people', 'who', 'aided', 'hiding', 'group', 'eight', 'especially', 'young', 'women', 'named', 'Miep', 'Lili', 'Taylor', 'also', 'speculation', 'exactly', 'who', 'betrayed', 'hiding', 'group', 'Note', 'never', 'been', 'proven', 'part', 'group', 'eight', 'being', 'discovered', 'Nazis', 'secret', 'police', 'Gestapo', 'being', 'taken', 'away', 'Aug.', '4', '1944', '75', 'minutes', '3', 'part', 'movie', 'what', 'happened', 'Anne', 'group', 'was', 'discovered', 'viewer', 'being', 'taken', 'Amsterdam', '1945', 'one', 'month', 'German', 'surrender', '55', 'minutes', '4', 'movie', 'printed', 'word', 'part', 'get', 'snippets', 'important', 'printed', 'information', 'example', '1957', 'Otto', 'Frank', '[', 'Anne', 'father', 'played', 'movie', 'Ben', 'Kingsley', ']', 'established', 'Anne', 'Frank', 'Foundation', 'working', 'educate', 'young', 'people', 'intolerance', 'discrimination', 'example', 'quoted', 'information', 'review', '3', 'minutes', 'What', 'movie', 'so', 'powerful', 'contrasts', 'see', 'part', 'Part', 'one', 'free', 'happy', 'Anne', 'part', 'two', 'hiding', 'hoping', 'Anne', 'part', 'three', 'fearful', 'prisoner', 'Anne.Note', 'movie', 'not', 'been', 'sanctioned', 'Anne', 'Frank', 'Foundation', 'Personally', 'ca', ""n't"", 'understand', 'why', 'follow', 'rather', 'closely', 'everything', ""'ve"", 'read.The', 'acting', 'movie', 'fantastic', 'Kudos', 'should', 'go', 'Hannah', 'Taylor-Gordon', 'who', 'essentially', 'movie', 'Anne.The', 'background', 'music', 'scene', 'even', 'cinematography', 'well', 'done.If', 'have', ""n't"", 'actually', 'read', 'Anne', 'diary', 'urge', 'do', 'so', 'recommend', '1993', 'Bantam', 'edition', 'not', 'only', 'actual', 'diary', 'also', 'information', 'Anne', 'diary', 'historical', 'context', 'as', 'well', 'pictures', 'illuminate', 'diary.Finally', 'DVD', 'perfect', 'picture', 'sound', 'quality', 'are', 'extras.In', 'conclusion', 'powerful', 'movie', 'worthy', 'companion', 'Anne', 'Frank', 'diary', '2001', '3', 'hr', '10', 'min', 'made', 'TV', 'full', 'screen', '22', 'scenes', '+++++']",Anne Frank - The Whole Story

662952,AITIU2DG1MM4A,B00005LC5R,Timothy Haugh,"[8, 10]","This is a film that needed to be made.  Based on Melissa Muller's biography, it covers Anne's life from the beginning of the war in Europe (1939) through her death in 1945.  Many people are familiar with the contents of the diary but don't have a sense of Anne's life as a whole.  This is a sad shortcoming which is helped by viewing this movie.There are some things that potential viewers should keep in mind, however.  This is a very long film--a little over three hours.  Additionally, as permission was not given for the film makers to use the content of Anne's diary, the scenes in the secret annex don't have the flavor that a person very familiar with the diary might expect.  Lastly, the cinematography sometimes leaves things to be desired.  Particularly outdoor scenes often have a tinge of unreality about them--as if it actually is a movie set.On the other hand, there are some very powerful performances here.  Ben Kingsley bears a striking resemblance to Otto Frank and plays the character very well.  He is a fine actor whose skills are well in evidence here.  Ultimately, however, it is Hannah Taylor Gordon as Anne who must make or break this film and she carries the weight of this story beautifully.  It is a performance that people should see.A final thought: as a high school teacher, I overheard some girls discussing the film after they had seen it.  One of them commented that she liked the film though she felt it was unrealistic.  She mentioned, in particular, the scene in Bergen-Belsen where one of her friends throws Anne food over the fence as being unlikely to have happened; and yet, this is a well-documented event told by survivors.  So many things about the Holocaust seem impossible.

662954,A1POFVVXUZR3IQ,B00005LC5R,Z Hayes,"[3, 4]","Anne Frank - The Whole Story""Anne Frank - the Whole Story"" is a well-acted and beautifully filmed movie based on Melissa Muller's biography of Anne Frank.It basically recounts how the Frank family comprising father Otto, mother Edith and daughters Margot and Anne chose to go into hiding in Amsterdam after the Nazis stepped up their persecution of Jews [and Margot got a summons for deportation].Their hiding place is a secret annex located in the factory run by Otto Frank. The Franks' trusted Gentile friends help them and soon the hiding place is opened to accommodate the Van Pels' [husband, wife and teen son, Peter] and a dentist, Mr Pfeffer. The Jewish refugees spend about 2 yrs in hiding, from July 1942 till Aug 1944 [when they were betrayed].This was a difficult movie to watch because I was already familiar with Anne's story [having read ""Diary of a Young Girl"" more than two decades ago] and knew what happened to Anne, her family and the rest of the hidden Jews. The movie was beautifully filmed with great attention to period details and the excellent casting choices made this the best movie on Anne Frank I've ever watched.Ben Kingsley is very credible as Otto Frank, the stoic WW I German veteran who is initially optimistic that the war will soon end. His intense bond and love for Anne is very real in this movie, as is his portrayal of  a protective family man who is determined to keep his family together, no matter what. Hannah Taylor-Gordon plays Anne Frank, and her resemblance to the real-life Anne is quite uncanny. Her portrayal of Anne is simply amazing - strong-willed, impetuous, candid, ambitious, and yet, underlying all that fierceness of spirit is a young girl on the brink of womanhood who yearns to be thought of as a woman and not a girl, and longs for freedom and love. When I read ""Diary of a Young Girl"", I always had a picture of Anne in my  mind and thought that Hannah Taylor Gordon played the role flawlessly.The supporting cast is also well-played - Tatjana Blacher plays the role of Edith Frank , the unassuming mother who has an abrasive relationship with Anne[ who feels her mother doesn't understand her] yet loves her daughters very much. The loud and aggressive Auguste Van Pels is played to perfection by Brenda Blethyn and her husband, Hermann is credibly portrayed by Joachim Krol. Jessica Manley plays Margot Frank with a quiet calmness that is tinged with sensitivity.The ""Righteous Gentiles"", those who helped Anne and her family throughout their hiding are well-portrayed as well, especially Lili Taylor as the courageous and devoted Miep Gies.The narration of the story flows smoothly from Anne's joyful childhood at the beginning of the movie to the fearful period when the Nazis invade and later start their persecution of the Dutch Jews to the awkwardness of the people in hiding [all the tensions between individuals who are forced to live in close quarters], and finally to their betrayal, arrest and deportation. The scenes in the camp are horrific [caution: there are scenes of female nudity] and the squalor in which Anne, Margot and Edith find themselves after being deported to Auschwitz [from the transit camp Westerbork] is terrible to watch. Margot and Anne are later transported to Bergen-Belsen, where conditions are inhuman - starvation is never ceasing, diseases are rampant and hope is dim.What stayed with me at the end of the movie was the final dialogue between Anne and Margot, where they struggle to remember their hopes and dreams that they once had, trying to imagine a life after the war and how those hopes would remain unfulfilled. It is a tragic testament to all those innocent lives that were lost during the Holocaust - the stolen childhoods, the lost innocence, dashed dreams and of the 1.5 million children who were silenced forever.I'd rate ""Anne Frank: The Whole Story"" a must-watch movie on the Holocaust.",5,The best re-telling of Anne Frank's story - amazing!,1231545600,"01 10, 2009",2009,3904,"['Anne', 'Frank', 'Whole', 'Story', 'Anne', 'Frank', 'Whole', 'Story', 'well-acted', 'beautifully', 'filmed', 'movie', 'based', 'Melissa', 'Muller', 'biography', 'Anne', 'Frank.It', 'basically', 'how', 'Frank', 'family', 'comprising', 'father', 'Otto', 'mother', 'Edith', 'daughters', 'Margot', 'Anne', 'chose', 'go', 'hiding', 'Amsterdam', 'Nazis', 'stepped', 'up', 'persecution', 'Jews', '[', 'Margot', 'got', 'summons', 'deportation', ']', '.Their', 'hiding', 'place', 'secret', 'annex', 'located', 'factory', 'run', 'Otto', 'Frank', 'Franks', 'trusted', 'Gentile', 'friends', 'help', 'soon', 'hiding', 'place', 'opened', 'accommodate', 'Van', 'Pels', '[', 'husband', 'wife', 'teen', 'son', 'Peter', ']', 'dentist', 'Mr', 'Pfeffer', 'Jewish', 'refugees', 'spend', '2', 'yrs', 'hiding', 'July', '1942', 'till', 'Aug', '1944', '[', 'when', 'were', 'betrayed', ']', '.This', 'was', 'difficult', 'movie', 'watch', 'was', 'already', 'familiar', 'Anne', 'story', '[', 'having', 'read', 'Diary', 'Young', 'Girl', 'more', 'two', 'decades', ']', 'knew', 'what', 'happened', 'Anne', 'family', 'rest', 'hidden', 'Jews', 'movie', 'was', 'beautifully', 'filmed', 'great', 'attention', 'period', 'details', 'excellent', 'casting', 'choices', 'made', 'best', 'movie', 'Anne', 'Frank', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'watched.Ben', 'Kingsley', 'very', 'credible', 'Otto', 'Frank', 'stoic', 'WW', 'German', 'veteran', 'who', 'initially', 'optimistic', 'war', 'will', 'soon', 'end', 'intense', 'bond', 'love', 'Anne', 'very', 'real', 'movie', 'portrayal', 'protective', 'family', 'man', 'who', 'determined', 'keep', 'family', 'together', 'matter', 'what', 'Taylor-Gordon', 'plays', 'Anne', 'Frank', 'resemblance', 'real-life', 'Anne', 'quite', 'uncanny', 'portrayal', 'Anne', 'simply', 'amazing', 'strong-willed', 'impetuous', 'candid', 'ambitious', 'yet', 'underlying', 'fierceness', 'spirit', 'young', 'girl', 'brink', 'womanhood', 'who', 'be', 'thought', 'woman', 'not', 'girl', 'longs', 'freedom', 'love', 'When', 'read', 'Diary', 'Young', 'Girl', 'always', 'had', 'picture', 'Anne', 'mind', 'thought', 'Hannah', 'Taylor', 'Gordon', 'played', 'role', 'flawlessly.The', 'supporting', 'cast', 'also', 'well-played', 'Tatjana', 'Blacher', 'role', 'Edith', 'Frank', 'unassuming', 'mother', 'who', 'abrasive', 'relationship', 'Anne', '[', 'who', 'mother', ""n't"", 'understand', ']', 'yet', 'daughters', 'very', 'much', 'loud', 'aggressive', 'Auguste', 'Van', 'Pels', 'played', 'perfection', 'Brenda', 'Blethyn', 'husband', 'Hermann', 'credibly', 'portrayed', 'Joachim', 'Krol', 'Jessica', 'Manley', 'Margot', 'Frank', 'quiet', 'calmness', 'tinged', 'sensitivity.The', 'Righteous', 'Gentiles', 'who', 'helped', 'Anne', 'family', 'hiding', 'are', 'well-portrayed', 'well', 'especially', 'Lili', 'Taylor', 'courageous', 'devoted', 'Miep', 'Gies.The', 'narration', 'story', 'smoothly', 'Anne', 'joyful', 'childhood', 'beginning', 'movie', 'fearful', 'period', 'when', 'Nazis', 'invade', 'later', 'start', 'persecution', 'Dutch', 'Jews', 'awkwardness', 'people', 'hiding', '[', 'tensions', 'individuals', 'who', 'are', 'forced', 'live', 'close', 'quarters', ']', 'finally', 'betrayal', 'arrest', 'deportation', 'scenes', 'camp', 'are', 'horrific', '[', 'caution', 'are', 'scenes', 'female', 'nudity', ']', 'squalor', 'Anne', 'Margot', 'Edith', 'find', 'being', 'deported', 'Auschwitz', '[', 'transit', 'camp', 'Westerbork', ']', 'terrible', 'watch', 'Margot', 'Anne', 'are', 'later', 'transported', 'Bergen-Belsen', 'where', 'conditions', 'are', 'inhuman', 'starvation', 'never', 'ceasing', 'diseases', 'are', 'rampant', 'hope', 'dim.What', 'stayed', 'end', 'movie', 'was', 'final', 'dialogue', 'Anne', 'Margot', 'where', 'struggle', 'remember', 'hopes', 'dreams', 'once', 'had', 'trying', 'imagine', 'life', 'war', 'how', 'hopes', 'would', 'remain', 'unfulfilled', 'tragic', 'testament', 'innocent', 'lives', 'were', 'lost', 'Holocaust', 'stolen', 'childhoods', 'lost', 'innocence', 'dashed', 'dreams', '1.5', 'million', 'children', 'who', 'were', 'silenced', 'forever.I', ""'d"", 'rate', 'Anne', 'Frank', 'Whole', 'Story', 'must-watch', 'movie', 'Holocaust']",Anne Frank - The Whole Story
