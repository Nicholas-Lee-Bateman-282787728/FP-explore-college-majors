1358807,A3MWYPZBKL1NJ,B003Q7B7H4,Jeffery Mingo,"[1, 2]","""She-Ra"" was really just ""He-Man"" with the genders reversed.  Still, it spoke to me back in my junior high days.  My little sister especially loved the show.  This episode was told in flashback.  It's basically the introduction of Castaspella.The more I watch the Smurfs, She-Ra, and other cartoons, the more I realize how derivative they are.  The evil queen in this episode was like the one in Disney's Snow White.  Her hair was covered and she had a seductive look.  Like the Witch in the Wizard of Oz, water played a role in her downfall.  Castaspella is like a reversal of the evil queen in Snow White.  That queen went from a vamp to an old peddler woman of her own free will.  Castaspella starts off as an old woman cursed by the queen and then becomes pretty and young.For people interested in She-Ra toys, it turns out that the Castaspella on TV look different from the doll.  On TV, her colors are blue and yellow.  The doll has shades of yellow.  The toy has a sunlike aura on her torso's back.  Castaspella on TV never has a glow or glimmer behind her.Like many a cartoon, here good conquers evil.  This came out long before the Shrek series, but this episode has that same message of not judging a book by its cover.",3,The Enchanted Castle,1363305600,"03 15, 2013",2013,1229,"['She-Ra', 'was', 'really', 'just', 'He-Man', 'genders', 'reversed', 'Still', 'spoke', 'back', 'junior', 'high', 'days', 'little', 'sister', 'especially', 'loved', 'show', 'episode', 'was', 'told', 'flashback', 'basically', 'introduction', 'Castaspella.The', 'more', 'watch', 'Smurfs', 'She-Ra', 'other', 'cartoons', 'more', 'realize', 'how', 'derivative', 'are', 'evil', 'queen', 'episode', 'was', 'one', 'Disney', 'Snow', 'White', 'hair', 'was', 'covered', 'had', 'seductive', 'look', 'Witch', 'Wizard', 'Oz', 'water', 'played', 'role', 'downfall', 'Castaspella', 'reversal', 'evil', 'queen', 'Snow', 'White', 'queen', 'went', 'vamp', 'old', 'peddler', 'woman', 'own', 'free', 'will', 'Castaspella', 'off', 'old', 'woman', 'cursed', 'queen', 'then', 'pretty', 'young.For', 'people', 'interested', 'She-Ra', 'toys', 'out', 'Castaspella', 'TV', 'look', 'different', 'doll', 'TV', 'colors', 'are', 'blue', 'yellow', 'doll', 'shades', 'yellow', 'toy', 'sunlike', 'aura', 'torso', 'back', 'Castaspella', 'TV', 'never', 'glow', 'glimmer', 'her.Like', 'many', 'cartoon', 'here', 'good', 'conquers', 'evil', 'came', 'out', 'long', 'Shrek', 'series', 'episode', 'same', 'message', 'not', 'judging', 'book', 'cover']",N/A
