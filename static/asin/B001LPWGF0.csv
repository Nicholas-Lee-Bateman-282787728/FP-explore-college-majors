1215599,A3EXWV8FNSSFL6,B001LPWGF0,Daniel G. Lebryk,"[6, 8]","Any guy over the age of 21 has seen this film 500 times, well I hope you haven't used your time that unwisely. The point, this story has been told over and over again, especially by National Lampoon.This is at best a 2 star movie if you put a teenagers hat on (as an adult it's probably -10 stars). It's got the whole thing, drinking, fights, parties, jiggle, urination, and seriously fake college campus equiped with awesomely bad fraternities and sororites.The back story, three high school seniors visit a campus and pretend to be college students. They fake pledge to a fraternity, and they get three girls. In the end they get found out and the three girls fall in love with these kids. In the meantime, the fun happens.It is just stupid enough for guy humor. There is absolutely no relationship between this and what really happens in college.On a positive note, the shots are all in focus, the sound is reasonably well recorded, and the lighting is good (that can't be said for many many films, including huge budge films). In it's genre, it's mid to bottom of the pack.The comparison to American Pie is really wrong. It's probably just barely as good at the 4th Amerian Pie movie (they got progressively worse).",2,Everything a 17 year old guy would want to watch,1233100800,"01 28, 2009",2009,1219,"['guy', 'age', '21', 'seen', 'film', '500', 'times', 'well', 'hope', 'have', ""n't"", 'used', 'time', 'unwisely', 'point', 'story', 'been', 'told', 'over', 'again', 'especially', 'National', 'Lampoon.This', 'best', '2', 'star', 'movie', 'put', 'teenagers', 'hat', 'adult', 'probably', '-10', 'stars', 'got', 'whole', 'thing', 'drinking', 'fights', 'parties', 'jiggle', 'urination', 'seriously', 'fake', 'college', 'campus', 'equiped', 'awesomely', 'bad', 'fraternities', 'sororites.The', 'back', 'story', 'three', 'high', 'school', 'seniors', 'visit', 'campus', 'pretend', 'be', 'college', 'students', 'fake', 'pledge', 'fraternity', 'get', 'three', 'girls', 'end', 'get', 'found', 'three', 'girls', 'fall', 'love', 'kids', 'meantime', 'fun', 'happens.It', 'just', 'stupid', 'enough', 'guy', 'humor', 'absolutely', 'relationship', 'really', 'college.On', 'positive', 'note', 'shots', 'are', 'focus', 'sound', 'reasonably', 'well', 'recorded', 'lighting', 'good', 'ca', ""n't"", 'be', 'said', 'many', 'many', 'films', 'including', 'huge', 'budge', 'films', 'genre', 'mid', 'bottom', 'pack.The', 'comparison', 'American', 'Pie', 'really', 'wrong', 'probably', 'just', 'barely', 'good', '4th', 'Amerian', 'Pie', 'movie', 'got', 'progressively', 'worse']",N/A
1215600,A3VLX5Z090RQ0V,B001LPWGF0,"Del Keyes ""Elaborate Chattering Nut""","[2, 6]","For all the hassle Drake has been given to Josh in their ownTV show, after it completed its run, who really got the last laugh?  Let's check their filmography:Josh Peck - ""Mean Creek"", ""The Wackness"", and the ""Ice Age"" seriesDrake Bell - ""Superhero Movie"",""The Nutty Professor"" animated movie, and...""College""The Bell has been cracked, and boy what a large gap it made.  This is one movie that really made me angry, and had to down a couple of beers to drown the misery.  It's primary goal is to be as disgusting, mean-spirited, and heartless as possible, nothing else.But at least the movie's advertisements didn't sell it as something else, because if the poster art of a guy throwing up in a toilet tells me anything, this movie has warning signs.  If you can look at the film's poster and find it amusing, and the thought of a bunch of teens pressured into drinking scotch drenching below a guy's hairy bum made you laugh, then you're going to like ""College""...and you'reAndy Milonakis.  Anyone else with even a hint of decency should just turn away and never look back.What I'm suppose to believe is a plot has three high school buddies going on a college weekend trip to see if they can be accepted. Because Drake Bell got dumped by his girlfriend, all because he wasn't cool enough, he's using this trip as a chance to prove his worth.  When they got there, they soon became pledges in a frat house of anarchy, and thus they pretend to be college freshmen to get laid. And nothing else significant happens, it's basically a series of gross-out situations leading up predictably to the kids getting back at the frat house in the most outlandish, impractical ways.  Situations regarding kegs, jugs, 'questionable' toys, drugs, a clogged-up toilet, used condoms, sodomy, farm animals, vomit, bodily fluids, and Verne Troyer; it's one crap after another, there's more crap here than Mr. Hankey's family reunion.Jeez, this movie manages to make the Farrelly Bros. movies look safe for children.  I don't see the point in it taking the ""Underground Comedy Movie"" route, being gross for its own sake.  They're never funny at all, just unnecessary shock and awe.  At least in otherlowbrowcomedies, it has likable characters to justify its vulgar behavior, but ""College"" doesn't have that.  The main characters are of the ""Superbad"" preset: Drake Bell is the Evan type, fat dude is the Seth type, and the nerd is the Fogell type, but neither of them have memorable or redeeming qualities as such.  The fat dude deserves special mention because he's the most repugnant human being I laid my eyes on: always making provocative sex jokes, making blatant g-a-y comments, insults his best friend, and belittles the nerd whether he knocks his stuff or push him around.  But unlike Seth who basically does the same things, this guy doesn't grow to acknowledge just how sensitive he really is or how special his relationship with his friends are, he stays that way for the whole movie.  He's a disgusting, sexist, aggressive, shameless monster...and I'm suppose to believe they're friends?  They have no chemistry with each other, I don't understand why the nerd is even friends with that monster; he's like a wife to an abusive spouse.  In fact, I'm pretty sure the college frats in this movie act like heartless beasts just so fatty can look less like a jerk...which doesn't work.What's worse, the movie can be offensive.  The frat house had a handicapped fellow in a wheelchair, covering in bandages due to the frats' tomfoolery, and he was used as target practice, people threw cups of beer at him, and was physically tortured.  And no one seems to be bothered by this, no one tries to rescue him?  Where were the authorities?  WHAT IS WRONG WITH THESE PEOPLE?  MANNERS DON'T SEEM TO EXIST IN THIS WORLD, THERE'S NO LOGIC OR DECENCY TO BE FOUND!  WHAT'S THE MESSAGE IN ALL THIS?  THIS MOVIE SHOULD BE BANNED FOR SUCH UNUSUAL CRUELTY!...stay calm.If anything, ""College"" does marks an achievement in film history. Director Deb Hagan made a stand against the male-dominated film industry. She successfully proved that girls can make a film just as vulgar and tasteless as those made by egotistic neanderthals of the National Lampoon variety. Congratulations, Debby, you deserve a special trophy.  I can tell you where you can to shove it, but I won't say it here.",1,Welcome To Hell: Alpha Sigma Style,1278115200,"07 3, 2010",2010,4354,"['hassle', 'Drake', 'been', 'given', 'Josh', 'ownTV', 'show', 'completed', 'run', 'who', 'really', 'got', 'last', 'laugh', 'Let', 'check', 'filmography', 'Josh', 'Peck', 'Mean', 'Creek', 'Wackness', 'Ice', 'Age', 'seriesDrake', 'Bell', 'Superhero', 'Movie', 'Nutty', 'Professor', 'animated', 'movie', 'College', 'Bell', 'been', 'cracked', 'boy', 'what', 'large', 'gap', 'made', 'one', 'movie', 'really', 'made', 'angry', 'had', 'down', 'couple', 'beers', 'drown', 'misery', 'primary', 'goal', 'be', 'disgusting', 'mean-spirited', 'heartless', 'possible', 'nothing', 'else.But', 'least', 'movie', 'advertisements', 'did', ""n't"", 'sell', 'something', 'else', 'poster', 'art', 'guy', 'throwing', 'up', 'toilet', 'anything', 'movie', 'warning', 'signs', 'can', 'look', 'film', 'poster', 'find', 'amusing', 'thought', 'bunch', 'teens', 'pressured', 'drinking', 'scotch', 'drenching', 'guy', 'hairy', 'bum', 'made', 'then', ""'re"", 'going', 'like', 'College', ""you'reAndy"", 'Milonakis', 'Anyone', 'else', 'even', 'hint', 'decency', 'should', 'just', 'turn', 'away', 'never', 'look', ""'m"", 'suppose', 'believe', 'plot', 'three', 'high', 'school', 'buddies', 'going', 'college', 'weekend', 'trip', 'see', 'can', 'be', 'accepted', 'Drake', 'Bell', 'got', 'dumped', 'girlfriend', 'was', ""n't"", 'cool', 'enough', 'using', 'trip', 'chance', 'prove', 'worth', 'When', 'got', 'there', 'soon', 'became', 'pledges', 'frat', 'house', 'anarchy', 'thus', 'pretend', 'be', 'college', 'freshmen', 'get', 'laid', 'nothing', 'else', 'significant', 'happens', 'basically', 'series', 'gross-out', 'situations', 'leading', 'up', 'predictably', 'kids', 'getting', 'back', 'frat', 'house', 'most', 'outlandish', 'impractical', 'ways', 'Situations', 'regarding', 'kegs', 'jugs', ""'questionable"", 'toys', 'drugs', 'clogged-up', 'toilet', 'used', 'condoms', 'sodomy', 'farm', 'animals', 'vomit', 'bodily', 'fluids', 'Verne', 'Troyer', 'one', 'crap', 'more', 'crap', 'here', 'Mr.', 'Hankey', 'family', 'reunion.Jeez', 'movie', 'make', 'Farrelly', 'Bros.', 'movies', 'look', 'safe', 'children', 'do', ""n't"", 'see', 'point', 'taking', 'Underground', 'Comedy', 'Movie', 'route', 'being', 'gross', 'own', 'sake', ""'re"", 'never', 'funny', 'just', 'unnecessary', 'shock', 'awe', 'least', 'otherlowbrowcomedies', 'likable', 'characters', 'justify', 'vulgar', 'behavior', 'College', ""n't"", 'have', 'main', 'characters', 'are', 'Superbad', 'preset', 'Drake', 'Bell', 'Evan', 'type', 'fat', 'dude', 'Seth', 'type', 'nerd', 'Fogell', 'type', 'have', 'memorable', 'redeeming', 'qualities', 'such', 'fat', 'dude', 'special', 'mention', 'most', 'repugnant', 'human', 'being', 'laid', 'eyes', 'always', 'making', 'provocative', 'sex', 'jokes', 'making', 'blatant', 'g-a-y', 'comments', 'insults', 'best', 'friend', 'nerd', 'stuff', 'push', 'around', 'Seth', 'who', 'basically', 'same', 'things', 'guy', ""n't"", 'grow', 'acknowledge', 'just', 'how', 'sensitive', 'really', 'how', 'special', 'relationship', 'friends', 'are', 'way', 'whole', 'movie', 'disgusting', 'sexist', 'aggressive', 'shameless', 'monster', ""'m"", 'suppose', 'believe', ""'re"", 'friends', 'have', 'chemistry', 'other', 'do', ""n't"", 'understand', 'why', 'nerd', 'even', 'friends', 'monster', 'wife', 'abusive', 'spouse', 'fact', ""'m"", 'pretty', 'sure', 'college', 'frats', 'movie', 'act', 'heartless', 'beasts', 'just', 'so', 'fatty', 'can', 'look', 'less', 'jerk', ""n't"", 'work.What', 'worse', 'movie', 'can', 'be', 'offensive', 'frat', 'house', 'had', 'handicapped', 'fellow', 'wheelchair', 'covering', 'bandages', 'due', 'frats', 'tomfoolery', 'was', 'used', 'target', 'practice', 'people', 'threw', 'cups', 'beer', 'was', 'physically', 'tortured', 'one', 'be', 'bothered', 'one', 'rescue', 'Where', 'were', 'authorities', 'WHAT', 'WRONG', 'WITH', 'THESE', 'PEOPLE', 'MANNERS', 'DO', ""N'T"", 'SEEM', 'TO', 'EXIST', 'IN', 'THIS', 'WORLD', 'THERE', 'NO', 'LOGIC', 'OR', 'DECENCY', 'TO', 'BE', 'FOUND', 'WHAT', 'MESSAGE', 'IN', 'ALL', 'THIS', 'THIS', 'MOVIE', 'SHOULD', 'BE', 'BANNED', 'FOR', 'SUCH', 'UNUSUAL', 'CRUELTY', 'stay', 'calm.If', 'anything', 'College', 'marks', 'achievement', 'film', 'history', 'Director', 'Deb', 'Hagan', 'made', 'stand', 'male-dominated', 'film', 'industry', 'successfully', 'proved', 'girls', 'can', 'make', 'film', 'just', 'vulgar', 'tasteless', 'made', 'egotistic', 'neanderthals', 'National', 'Lampoon', 'variety', 'Congratulations', 'Debby', 'deserve', 'special', 'trophy', 'can', 'tell', 'where', 'can', 'shove', 'wo', ""n't"", 'say', 'here']",N/A
1215601,A2BQBLCKJHP65G,B001LPWGF0,"Eric Ericson ""RedSabbath""","[6, 6]","Honestly, I'm surprised the current direct-to-video headliner ""National Lampoon's..."" wasn't above the title. Take three typical high school seniors, the fat wisecrack kid (think Jack Black & Chris Farley had a son), the nerdy kid (played by Kevin Covais, American Idol 5th Season finalist who no one really took seriously), and the ""normal"" kid (Nickelodeon escapee Drake Bell), and place them in the same old story of spending their first weekend ever in the future college they wish to attend and all the equally stereotypical hot drunk girls and mean as Hell frat guys they encounter. If you've seen Animal House, Revenge Of The Nerds, or any film that had some member counting on getting that scholarship and drunkenly blowing it badly, you've already seen this film. However due to the changing times, the extremely high levels of nudity and sexual situations, surprisingly high in let's say ""alternative lifestyles"", will remind you why films like this today need that little over-the-top extra to even get mentioned in the same paragraph as those real college classics. But when it boils down to it, it does have a couple of laughs, groans, and guffaws, but nothing to make you really want to see it a second time. It's disc has both the Unrated (that really, really pushes it) and a Rated (will anybody choose/see this version?) plus a gag reel, half of which is already in the end credits ala a Burt Reynolds film. For a rent it's not too bad, but the filmmakers here should go back a grade to see why college films succeeded so much in the first place without trying so hard to blow us away with gross-out jokes than actually well-written ones.(RedSabbath Rating:6.0/10)",2,These Animals Need A New House & Should Have To Go Back To School...,1235952000,"03 2, 2009",2009,1681,"['Honestly', ""'m"", 'surprised', 'current', 'direct-to-video', 'headliner', 'National', 'Lampoon', 'was', ""n't"", 'title', 'Take', 'three', 'typical', 'high', 'school', 'seniors', 'fat', 'wisecrack', 'kid', 'think', 'Jack', 'Black', 'Chris', 'Farley', 'had', 'son', 'nerdy', 'kid', 'played', 'Kevin', 'Covais', 'American', 'Idol', '5th', 'Season', 'finalist', 'who', 'one', 'really', 'took', 'seriously', 'normal', 'kid', 'Nickelodeon', 'escapee', 'Drake', 'Bell', 'place', 'same', 'old', 'story', 'spending', 'first', 'weekend', 'ever', 'future', 'college', 'wish', 'attend', 'equally', 'stereotypical', 'hot', 'drunk', 'girls', 'mean', 'Hell', 'frat', 'guys', 'encounter', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'Animal', 'House', 'Revenge', 'Nerds', 'film', 'had', 'member', 'counting', 'getting', 'scholarship', 'drunkenly', 'blowing', 'badly', ""'ve"", 'already', 'seen', 'film', 'However', 'due', 'changing', 'times', 'extremely', 'high', 'levels', 'nudity', 'sexual', 'situations', 'surprisingly', 'high', 'let', 'say', 'alternative', 'lifestyles', 'will', 'remind', 'why', 'films', 'today', 'need', 'little', 'over-the-top', 'extra', 'even', 'get', 'mentioned', 'same', 'paragraph', 'real', 'college', 'classics', 'when', 'down', 'have', 'couple', 'laughs', 'groans', 'guffaws', 'nothing', 'make', 'really', 'want', 'see', 'second', 'time', 'disc', 'Unrated', 'really', 'really', 'Rated', 'will', 'anybody', 'choose/see', 'version', 'gag', 'reel', 'half', 'already', 'end', 'ala', 'Burt', 'Reynolds', 'film', 'rent', 'not', 'too', 'bad', 'filmmakers', 'here', 'should', 'go', 'back', 'grade', 'see', 'why', 'college', 'films', 'succeeded', 'so', 'much', 'first', 'place', 'trying', 'so', 'hard', 'blow', 'away', 'gross-out', 'jokes', 'actually', 'well-written', 'ones', 'RedSabbath', 'Rating:6.0/10']",N/A

1215603,A32IDF7JFAPXAG,B001LPWGF0,"Joshua Glowzinski ""Gman""","[2, 4]","I saw this on iTunes and thought it may be funny.  I haven't liked any of the national lampoons movies that have come out lately.  Actually I didn't even like Animal House.  That was before my time though.  I'm only 23.  Ok enough talking about random things.  Here is my review of the movie.Firstly let me say that I have never heard of any of the actors in this movie.  I think that really helped.  Sometimes is good to know the actors in movies.  Other times though, I think it's good to have nothing to compare them to.  The main actors in this movie are Drake Bell, Andrew Caldwell, Andree Moss, Carolyn Moss, Wendy Talley and Kevin Covais.  One of the guys in this movie looks just like Johnny noxville some of the time and looks and acts like Robert Downey Jr. other times.  Ok, though I have never seen any of these actors in anything.  I think they do a pretty good job on this movie.  They seem a little rough around the edges.  This makes the movie even better.  Rather than taking an actor that does a certin type of comedy that we all know and are used to.  They bring these guys.  Nice job!The movie is about 3 friends.  Two are going to check out a college together.  One of them has set everything up and he needs to go so his parents leave him alone.  The other is looking forward to seeing the college also.  They have a third friend who tells them there losers and that he isn't going.  That is until another guy comes and tells them about the great things that have happened to him when he went to a college.  The third boy now wants to go.  So off they are.  They were all ready to stay in this dorm.  Thanks to the one friend who set it all up.  When they get there and go into the room though.... The guy there is doing something.  I won't say what.  But they choose not to stay there.  So one of them has a brother that used to go to this frat.  They go there and ask if they can say.  Eventually they get to sleep there.  There stay does not come easy.  The frat guy all haze them and try to make there life as hard as possible.  The stuff that they do is pretty funny.  The main boy in the frat takes getting used to though.  He does lines from various movies and even a cartoon.  I didn't know what I was supposed to see him as.  Eventually they think of a way to get back at the frat house for everything that have been through.So, why the 3 out of 5?  I'll tell you why.  First of all the movie played for like 1:30:55.  At about 1:17 they realize that they can get back at the frat.  I thought that's what the movie was about.  But they try to fit so much in, in such a short amount of time, that it just feels rushed.  It kind of goes through some of the parts very fast.  Like showing them doing stuff while playing music.  Second, a couple of the actors have so many personalities.  I didn't know what kind of person they were supposed to be.  They did leave it open for another movie though.  So let's hope they make another, that fixes the few small problems that this one had.",3,No Lampoons in this national.

Basically Superbad-lite, College tells the tale of a trio of high school kids (Drake Bell, Andrew Caldwell, Kevin Covais) looking for some fun at a college campus on the weekend.  Running afoul of some frat boys (Nick Zano, Gary Owen, and Whitest Kids U Know member Zach Cregger), the trio partake in the usual mix of hijinks that you'd expect from this sort of thing, with a few laughs to be found to be sure, but not nearly enough to hold your interest during the film's whole running time.  It doesn't help when our trio of heroes prove to be more annoying than the frat boys they're taking on either.  You'll definitely see worse comedies of this type than College, but you know you're in for a rough time when you get more laughs watching the DVD's blooper reel than watching the actual flick.",2,Nothing new,1233705600,"02 4, 2009",2009,1018,"['College', 'same', 'tried', 'true', 'portrait', 'drunken', 'debauchery', 'high', 'school', 'kids', 'love', 'watch', 'provide', 'little', 'bit', 'laughs', ""n't"", 'end', 'up', 'nearly', 'being', 'as', 'funny', 'could', 'be', 'Basically', 'Superbad-lite', 'College', 'tale', 'trio', 'high', 'school', 'kids', 'Drake', 'Bell', 'Andrew', 'Caldwell', 'Kevin', 'Covais', 'looking', 'fun', 'college', 'campus', 'weekend', 'Running', 'afoul', 'frat', 'boys', 'Nick', 'Zano', 'Gary', 'Owen', 'Whitest', 'Kids', 'U', 'Know', 'member', 'Zach', 'Cregger', 'trio', 'partake', 'usual', 'mix', 'hijinks', ""'d"", 'expect', 'sort', 'thing', 'few', 'laughs', 'be', 'found', 'be', 'sure', 'not', 'nearly', 'enough', 'hold', 'interest', 'film', 'whole', 'running', 'time', ""n't"", 'help', 'when', 'trio', 'heroes', 'prove', 'be', 'more', 'annoying', 'frat', ""'re"", 'taking', ""'ll"", 'definitely', 'see', 'worse', 'comedies', 'type', 'College', 'know', ""'re"", 'rough', 'time', 'when', 'get', 'more', 'laughs', 'watching', 'DVD', 'blooper', 'reel', 'watching', 'actual', 'flick']",N/A

Well he better luck next time and stick to what he knows best.  I giggled a few times during this movie, all mainly because most of it was a total rip-off from its big brother Superbad!
