Lee Zimmerman ""Trekscribbler (aka Ed)""","[2, 2]","I realize that police procedurals are a dime a dozen - every major television production company around the world has several in production at any given moment - but there's something to be said for the adherence to quality set by the Chief Inspector George Gently serials.  While the series was created by Peter Flannery, the stories are adapted from the novels of Alan Hunter.  They're all set in the early 1960's at a time when the morals of a society were in flux - the English were still dealing with recovering from world wars, discrimination was something folks were actively dealing with, family life was in a constant state of change, etc. - and all of those circumstances are brought to life in this vivid tales involving an aging chief inspector and his brash, young prot&eacute;g&eacute;.(NOTE: the following review will contain minor spoilers necessary solely for the discussion of characters and plot.  If you're the kind of reader who prefers a review entirely spoiler-free, then I'd suggest you skip down to the last paragraph for my final assessment.  If, however, you're accepting of modest hints at `things to come,' then read on ...)The second season includes four 90-minute stories, as follows:""Gently With The Innocents"": The elderly Alfred Peachment is found murdered on the grounds of a large estate he's shared ownership with his wife (they're now separated) for years.  When Gently (played by Martin Shaw) and his assistant John Bacchus (Ingleby) are initially drawn to a reclusive land developer - Cora Davidson (Jill Halfpenny) - they're surprised to uncover a curious relationship between her and the property ... and a secret that threatens to perhaps indict a whole town.""Gently In The Night"": The body of the late Audrey Chadwick (Sian Breckin) is found laid out peacefully on the altar of a nearby church.  When Gently and Bacchus investigate, they find out that Audrey was living a double-life of sorts - her parents believed she was a successful nurse relocating to London for her career, while she was secretly a high-end cocktail waitress for an exclusive men's club.  What they uncover will not only challenge the stories of a local businessman but also the credibility of some notable citizens.""Gently In The Blood"": A sting to capture someone dealing in stolen passports leads Gently and Bacchus to something they never expected: the rape and murder of Maggie Alderton, a clerk in the local passport office.  What seems to be an open-and-shut case begins to unravel, perhaps indicting some local Muslims who were dealing in several possible criminal affairs.  However, when the detectives dig deeper, they realize one family's secrets - if revealed - might lead to even greater consequences.""Gently Through The Mill"": When Patrick Fuller (Joe Duttine) is found hanged in the flour mill he manages, Gently and Bacchus begin to suspect foul play instead of suicide.  Of course, things are never what they seem, and, as they peel back the layers of conspiracy surrounding the man's business, they find infidelity may have played a factor.  Before all is said and done, Gently will have to investigate a pair of shady politicians, while Bacchus will have joined the Freemasons!I can't tell you how thrilled my wife and I have been since we discovered these George Gently tales.  Initially, I was given a copy of his fourth season; we viewed it in a single weekend, and we immediately set out to get a copy of the first season, hoping to see where it all started.  What we learned was that, yes, there was a solid foundation for the two leads - Gently and Bacchus - in those early shows, but they weren't necessarily required or relevant viewing for what we'd already seen in the fourth series, nor the second.  Of course, some of the smaller moments make greater impact when you know where they came from and how their partnership came to be (in particular, there's some solid development in the last episode from this second season that puts the pair in a kind of creative cliffhanger), but they can be enjoyed independently.For the record, this second season has been my favorite (so far!).  The stories are all terrific, with some wonderfully fleshed out moments for even secondary characters.  ""Gently With The Innocents"" is, arguably, the darkest of the programs we've seen, but ""Gently In The Blood"" is such a tremendous stand-out to this individual series.  In fact, the story is so solid that Gently and Bacchus probably spend less time on-screen, surrendering much of the narrative to people who've not yet seen before in order to have them tell their story directly.  It's a very strong tale, one that explores more family secrets than one family should have.GEORGE GENTLY: SEASON 2 is produced by the British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC), Company Pictures (for the BBC), Element Pictures, and the Irish Film Board (funding only).  DVD distribution (stateside) is being handled by Acorn Media.  As for the technical specifications, these four discs all look and sounds excellent; clearly, no expense has been spared in bringing these stories to life.  Thankfully, the discs are produced with an English-subtitling track for those of us who occasionally struggle with foreign accents (count me in).  Lastly, there's a brief interview with the series regulars as a special feature, otherwise that's about all there is.  While I'd personally love to know more, I can certainly understand that there's probably little need for further commentary here.HIGHEST RECOMMENDATION POSSIBLE.  If you don't know who Chief Inspector George Gently is, then you've no idea of what you're missing.  These detective procedurals are set in the early-to-mid-1960's, they cover the gamut of social influences of the time, and they're grounded in some excellent writing (adapted from novels) and exceptional performances.  Rest assured: if you haven't seen the first season, then there's no problem jumping on here, as these cases pretty much all stand on their own, though you'll miss some of the characterizations put down in those earlier installments.",5,George Gently: Series 2 Is Nothing Short of Fantastic,1357344000,"01 5, 2013",2013,6081,"['realize', 'police', 'procedurals', 'are', 'dime', 'dozen', 'major',

In the 1st, George Gently is a fearless London crime fighter cop who moves to Northumberland (NE England) after his wife is murdered. Gently has not given up fighting crime of all sorts and is now Chief Inspector in the new, and extremely beautiful north countryside.Perhaps even better than the great plots of crime that Gently faces is the relationship with his Sargent John Bacchus (Lee Ingleby-'Nicholas Nicleby'), a very young assistant in the investigations, intent on learning from and outdoing his leader, Gently. Their work together, dialogue, and personal relationship is often funny--always entertaining. Ingleby is as good at being Bacchus as star Martin Shaw ('Judge John Deed''The Professionals''Master and Commander')is at being the not-so-gentle-Gently.The show is very comparable to other perfections in British Crime/Mystery Drama such as ""Murdoch Mysteries""-Victorian era crime, ""Foyles War""-WWII era crime, and ""Midsomer Murders"" country village crime outside of London. This ""GEORGE GENTLY"" series takes place in 1964, as authentic in detail to the era as the other shows, although not as many murders as Midsome--but they try at times. Gently doesn't have as large a group of assistants as Murdoch--but he gets all he needs in help and entertainment factor from his one primary partner in sleuthing. Masterful writing in this Cop-copper relationship, youth pitted against the old, experience against initiative, big-city experience vs small-town skill.Episodes include:1 Gently with the Innocents--murder in a children's home.2 Gently in the Night--corpse on a church altar.3 Gently in the Blood--passport fraud, murder, Arab intolerance, more.4 Gently Through the Mill--is it suicide or murder?

Working in the north of England in the early 1960's Gently uses his native wit and experience to solve crimes with the help of his young assistant Bacchus.Bacchus seems quite flawed, a bit of a twit, really and annoying.  But George Gently is fairly gentle and rather patient with him, so we will have to be also.  They both seem like real people, not actors playing a role.  Gently is classy, courtly almost, and dominates every scene he is in. Love his voice and facial expressions.  He deals skilfully, intuitively and intelligently with witnesses, victims and possible suspects.  He is not afraid to buck his superiors but only when necessary.While the series is set in the 1960's, it has a contemporary feel.  The plots are more important than the time setting.  The series should grow on you as you become more enamored with its characters and scenery.  Bacchus will have to grow a bit more, to my sense, not to irritate but he livens up the show with his antics and immaturity.

The first one featuring digusting pedophiles and the way society up to that time denied that it was a problem is probably the most powerful of the lot.  The murder mysteries are serious stuff here and very realistic as well as the storylines.  When watching this show you see just where british society was at during the period, they were strangled by conventions and lack of personal freedom, unfortunately now the uk has so far the other way the place is out of control socially with the largest teen preg rate in europe and drug abuse rates are terrible too. not EVerything from the old world was bad and this show reflects that as well.  .  there must be a middle ground and this show is taking place when the old overly strict order was beginning to fade.  the other mysteries also feature some part of society that was in struggle then. like a playboy type club being seen as too sinful etc.  I do think that four eps addressing social issues and not just plain old murder does push it abit,but the writing is very well done. and the lead actor is so good that I would say he becomes his character. A good decent cop who knows whats right and wrong but knows if people go too far it will be chaos. which it is in the uk these days socially.The dvd looks gorgeous too with the 1960's coming alive in vivid detail.  This show is top notch and I would say that I would be surprised if it's lead actor (shaw) doesn't win a british film award for this. He should, if he hasn't at least.  the extras are limited on this set, like most brit shows. And one must mention the great musical soundtrack made with real instruments. watching a detective show with rap or techno on it is enough to make me want to shut it off but here you get well written tunes and that helps.

Detective Gently is from the UK and rose through the ranks at Scotland Yard. His wife was murdered in front of his eyes and he decided to retire. However, a case came his way that involved his wife's murderer, and he took it. The case took him to the north of England, Northumberland, near the Scottish border, and he found he liked it. Gently found his new home.The time is 1964, England is still in the leeway between the conservative UK and the new generation that wants to be free. The bouffant hairdos, the shirt and ties and blue suits. The times they are a'changin', but The Beatles have not invaded as of yet. Northumberland seems to be the seat of drug running and other crimes, and Chief Detective Inspector is kept quite busy. His partner in crime, so to speak, is young Detective Sergeant, Lee Ingleby, aka John Bacchus. Detective Sgt Bacchusis a work in progress, and Gently has some work in front of him. Bacchus is very young, but determined to be the best detective he can be. He is married to the Chief Constable's daughter, and it appears he married her because she was pregnant, and not because he loved her. We can see trouble on the horizon. We don't know much about Gently's personal life, this is all business, and he is having difficulty while mourning his wife's death.Gently is a very classy man, and he is a perfectionist. He is also one of the more intelligent detectives, and we learn how he solves a case. He is polite, does not believe in brutality with the people who he arrests or brings in for questioning. Brutality seems to be the right of passage at this time, and it is a good lesson that Gently bestows on Bacchus.  The cases they solve are extraordinary and so well written. This is a series that keeps us involved and interested. An intelligent series that appeals to the masses.  The mystery series that the UK brings to us are addicting.  They are far and above some of the best written shows.  No wonder that PBS brings these shows to us. George Gently and John Bacchus become involved in murders at a sex club, with corrupt politicians, gangs, drug running and in-between run into racism. They deal with all of this deftly and rarely encounter violence.One of the better mystery series from the UK. I read recently that the George Gently series will continue, and we shall see more of a detective series that has become a favorite.Highly Recommended.  prisrob 06-21-10Judge John Deed: Season One & Pilot EpisodeThe Silmarillion, Vol. 2",5,Go Gently Into The Night,1277078400,"06 21, 2010",2010,2626,"['George', 'Gently', 'played', 'Martin', 'Shaw', 'kind', 'Chief', 'Detective', 'Inspector', 'would', 'want', 'advising', 'working', 'town', 'Detective', 'Gently', 'UK', 'rose', 'ranks', 'Scotland', 'Yard', 'wife', 'was', 'murdered', 'front', 'eyes', 'decided', 'retire', 'However', 'case', 'came', 'way', 'involved', 'wife', 'murderer', 'took', 'case', 'took', 'north', 'England', 'Northumberland', 'Scottish', 'border', 'found', 'liked', 'Gently', 'found', 'new', 'home.The', 'time', '1964', 'England', 'still', 'leeway', 'conservative', 'UK', 'new', 'generation', 'be', 'free', 'bouffant', 'hairdos', 'shirt', 'ties', 'blue', 'suits', 'times', 'are', ""a'changin"", 'Beatles', 'have', 'not', 'invaded', 'yet', 'Northumberland', 'be', 'seat', 'drug', 'running', 'other', 'crimes', 'Chief', 'Detective', 'Inspector', 'kept', 'quite', 'busy', 'partner', 'crime', 'so', 'speak', 'young', 'Detective', 'Sergeant', 'Lee', 'Ingleby', 'John', 'Bacchus', 'Detective', 'Sgt', 'Bacchusis', 'work', 'progress', 'Gently', 'work', 'front', 'Bacchus', 'very', 'young', 'determined', 'be', 'best', 'detective', 'can', 'be', 'married', 'Chief', 'Constable', 'daughter', 'married', 'was', 'pregnant', 'not', 'loved', 'can', 'see', 'trouble', 'horizon', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'much', 'Gently', 'personal', 'life', 'business', 'having', 'difficulty', 'mourning', 'wife', 'death.Gently', 'very', 'classy', 'man', 'perfectionist', 'also', 'one', 'more', 'intelligent', 'detectives', 'learn', 'how', 'case', 'polite', 'not', 'believe', 'brutality', 'people', 'who', 'questioning', 'Brutality', 'be', 'right', 'passage', 'time', 'good', 'lesson', 'Gently', 'Bacchus', 'cases', 'solve', 'are', 'extraordinary', 'so', 'well', 'written', 'series', 'involved', 'interested', 'intelligent', 'series', 'appeals', 'masses', 'mystery', 'series', 'UK', 'are', 'addicting', 'are', 'far', 'best', 'written', 'shows', 'wonder', 'PBS', 'shows', 'George', 'Gently', 'John', 'Bacchus', 'become', 'involved', 'murders', 'sex', 'club', 'corrupt', 'politicians', 'gangs', 'drug', 'running', 'in-between', 'run', 'racism', 'deal', 'deftly', 'rarely', 'encounter', 'violence.One', 'better', 'mystery', 'series', 'UK', 'read', 'recently', 'George', 'Gently', 'series', 'will', 'continue', 'shall', 'see', 'more', 'detective', 'series', 'become', 'favorite.Highly', 'Recommended', 'prisrob', '06-21-10Judge', 'John', 'Deed', 'Season', 'One', 'Pilot', 'EpisodeThe', 'Silmarillion', 'Vol', '2']",George Gently: Series Two

1319556,A3RNP5X8ZGZIEI,B00331RHCM,Stephanie De Pue,"[8, 8]","""George Gently: Series 2,"" a first-rate television series of British mysteries/police procedurals that has never been broadcast in the United States,  debuted in the United Kingdom on BBC1 in May 2009.  It's set in Northeast Britain, Geordie country, amid the upheavals and excesses of the 1960s. The production stars respected, award-winning actor Martin Shaw (Judge John Deed: Season One & Pilot Episode) as Commander George Gently; and is based on the long-running series of detective novels by Alan Hunter. It comes in a boxed,  four DVD set of four feature-length episodes, running approximately 88 minutes each, for a total of  356 min., with subtitles, thank goodness, as Geordie-speak falls hard upon American ears.Gently is an inconveniently incorruptible top cop, disliked almost as much by his colleagues as by criminal elements, and, therefore, bounced from Scotland Yard to Northumbria.  There he finds an unexpected ally in ambitious young Sergeant John Bacchus, an overeager, opinionated young man who tends to play fast and loose with police procedures, a part played by Lee Ingleby (Nicholas Nickleby).  Guest stars include Tim McInnerney (Complete Black Adder (8pc) [VHS]); Nicholas Jones (Kavanagh QC, Set 1); Mark Williams (the Harry Potter films), and Andrew Lee Potts (Primeval: Volume 1 (Series 1 and 2)).The well-written, stylishly directed, absorbing mysteries unfold against a beautiful backdrop we're meant to think is rural Britain, though as the series was partly financed by the Irish Film Board, I wonder if we aren't looking at beautiful rural Ireland. There are excellent supporting casts, extras aplenty, and the characters' clothing and cars are appropriate to the era, when Britain was beginning to shake off its post-war deprivation and depression, and London was beginning to swing a bit.The mysteries are:""Gently with the Innocents.""  When local real estate developer Cora Davidson shows up at a newly-purchased property slated for demolition, she finds the unhappy seller butchered in his backyard.  Suspicion falls on a mute gardener.""Gently in the Night.""  A pretty young woman clothed and shod a la mod, in go-go boots, turns up murdered, laid out on the altar of a Newcastle church.  Investigation reveals she worked at Rake's, a Playboy Club clone that is drawing unwanted attention from religious protesters.""Gently in the Blood.""  Another lovely young woman found murdered, shortly after giving birth to a child that has started questions; the theft of expired passports; potential violent ethnic hatreds in a seaside town; the victim's boyfriend involved with a gang of Arab toughs.  This powerful episode actually reduced me to tears, a rare happening for a mystery series.""Gently Through the Mill.""  Patrick Fuller, mill manager, found hanged from the rafters of his workplace.  Suicide or murder? Investigation uncovers adultery, embezzlement, corruption.These are substantial, complex plots, driven by vivid characters, and strong women, and I found them quite gripping.  Shaw plays the title character as a man of gravitas, and an insightful detective.  I found the 60's setting more recognizable in this second series than the first: Bacchus has a Beatles haircut, and the girls wear white go-go boots; perhaps what we think of as the 60's didn't really get smoking until 1964.  Of course, the quality of the film work still makes obvious that this is a contemporary work. We need to see brief scenes of people smoking where they ought not to today, hear prices quoted in the old money, pounds, shillings and pence, or, I suppose, the capital punishment scenes serve as pretty good reminders of the historical setting, too.Initially, I'd wondered how much of the Swinging Sixties actually went north, until the setting of the second episode, in a Playboy-club like venue in Newcastle, reminded me that two of the greatest British films noir of the twentieth century were set in contemporaneous Newcastle.  You've gotGet Carter, apparently based on a true life case, starring Michael Caine, who's always played a great gangster, with a stellar supporting cast behind him.  And then there'sStormy Monday, that was apparently filmed in Newcastle as a homage to ""Get Carter;"" it starred Sean Bean, Tommy Lee Jones, and Melanie Griffith.  So we can rest assured; the once-quiet northeast corner of England, far from London, got to experience the social, sexual, and political changes that characterized the 1960s as we knew them.
