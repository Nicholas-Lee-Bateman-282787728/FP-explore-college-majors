1170503,AV34HT7D2UZM0,B001B43IVW,Bee,"[2, 2]",This is a series that I did not want to end.  I hope there will be a Series Two released soon.  Rachel Ward is her usual marvelous actress and the supporting role by Victoria Thaine was excellent.  This is about the hardship of a Vet in the Australian outback whose hard attitude makes it difficult for any assistant to stay on and work with her.  When a new assistant comes from the city she is determined to stay and begins to love the work in the outback and understand the situation.

1170507,AO1Z0TQWCRGL4,B001B43IVW,"Harold Wolf ""Doc""","[52, 52]","Six episodes are not enough.  It's that good. The views of the rain shadow country alone make the viewer desire to experience the ruggedness, even overcome the hardships.  This Australian drama was filmed in southern Australia, rain shadow country. A rain shadow is an arid region on the lee side of mountains allowing little rain to cross, like Nevada. It creates a setting as tough, as desperate, and as determined as the veterinarian Kate McDonald living in fictional Paringa.Dr. Kate (widowed 10 years) is played by Rachel Ward. Ward turns from her more recent directing and writing activities to lead the cast with her superb acting portrayal of a woman who has taken charge of her life caught up in extreme harshness located an arid region and a struggling community.  Driving into Paringa, is the newest arrival in a long string of attempts to secure an assistant, in the person of Dr. Jill Blake (Victoria Thaine).  Her own extraordinary performance adds to the off-again, on-again, personal and professional relationship between the two vets that have a community animal health situation to deal with as well as their own secret lives.  It's a powerful combination as intriguing as the interacting lives of the rest of Paringa's citizens.Move aside, James Herriot, make room, as Rain Shadow has rekindled interest in a country veterinarian's life.  Dr. Jill is new, not nearly as tough as Dr. Kate McDonald--YET! And the viewer is as confused about the history and personality exchanges of Paringa as Jill. The community seems to have it's own definitions for integrity and law. For example Larry Riley's (Gary Sweet) unexplained wealth in a struggling location. And, why were so many other newly arriving vet assistants driven off so fast?This is a contemporary wild country, gritty, survival-of-the-fittest story; not altogether unlike some old tales of the US Wild West. Rain Shadow is gripping drama that, although it ends satisfactorily, it leaves itself open for a reunion and an additional series. Hopefully writers Tony Morphett and Jimmy Thomson will comply.  I for one would like to spend another six hours with the lady vets' adventures.Viewing ladies will like the assertiveness (to the point of big, bad, boldness) of the pair of female Paringa vets. Men will wonder if they would have the fortitude to stick it out, like the courageous young and old men of the Rain Shadow. At what lengths would you go? At what point of endurance would you fold it in? IN REALITY, how much longer can you wait to see this stunning story of those determined to live through the drought, persevere, and conquer the outback?Each of the 6 episodes of Rain Shadow is equal to a 5-star movie.",5,A STORY OF LADY VETS TOUGHING IT OUT IN A RUGGED MAN'S REGION--AND WINNING,1222992000,"10 3, 2008",2008,2693,"['Six', 'episodes', 'are', 'not', 'enough', 'good', 'views', 'rain', 'shadow', 'country', 'alone', 'make', 'viewer', 'desire', 'experience', 'ruggedness', 'even', 'overcome', 'hardships', 'Australian', 'drama', 'was', 'filmed', 'southern', 'Australia', 'rain', 'shadow', 'country', 'rain', 'shadow', 'arid', 'region', 'lee', 'side', 'mountains', 'allowing', 'little', 'rain', 'cross', 'Nevada', 'setting', 'tough', 'desperate', 'as', 'determined', 'veterinarian', 'Kate', 'McDonald', 'living', 'fictional', 'Paringa.Dr', 'Kate', 'widowed', '10', 'years', 'played', 'Rachel', 'Ward', 'Ward', 'more', 'recent', 'directing', 'writing', 'activities', 'lead', 'cast', 'superb', 'acting', 'portrayal', 'woman', 'who', 'taken', 'charge', 'life', 'caught', 'up', 'extreme', 'harshness', 'located', 'arid', 'region', 'struggling', 'community', 'Driving', 'Paringa', 'newest', 'arrival', 'long', 'string', 'attempts', 'secure', 'assistant', 'person', 'Dr.', 'Jill', 'Blake', 'Victoria', 'Thaine', 'own', 'extraordinary', 'performance', 'off-again', 'on-again', 'personal', 'professional', 'relationship', 'two', 'vets', 'have', 'community', 'animal', 'health', 'situation', 'deal', 'as', 'well', 'own', 'secret', 'lives', 'powerful', 'combination', 'as', 'intriguing', 'interacting', 'lives', 'rest', 'Paringa', 'citizens.Move', 'aside', 'James', 'Herriot', 'make', 'room', 'Rain', 'Shadow', 'rekindled', 'interest', 'country', 'veterinarian', 'life', 'Dr.', 'Jill', 'new', 'not', 'nearly', 'as', 'tough', 'Dr.', 'Kate', 'McDonald', 'viewer', 'confused', 'history', 'personality', 'exchanges', 'Paringa', 'Jill', 'community', 'have', 'own', 'definitions', 'integrity', 'law', 'example', 'Larry', 'Riley', 'Gary', 'Sweet', 'unexplained', 'wealth', 'struggling', 'location', 'why', 'were', 'so', 'many', 'other', 'newly', 'arriving', 'vet', 'assistants', 'driven', 'off', 'fast', 'contemporary', 'wild', 'country', 'gritty', 'survival-of-the-fittest', 'story', 'not', 'old', 'tales', 'US', 'Wild', 'West', 'Rain', 'Shadow', 'gripping', 'drama', 'satisfactorily', 'open', 'reunion', 'additional', 'series', 'Hopefully', 'writers', 'Tony', 'Morphett', 'Jimmy', 'Thomson', 'will', 'comply', 'one', 'would', 'like', 'spend', 'six', 'hours', 'lady', 'vets', 'adventures.Viewing', 'ladies', 'will', 'like', 'assertiveness', 'point', 'big', 'bad', 'boldness', 'pair', 'female', 'Paringa', 'vets', 'Men', 'will', 'wonder', 'would', 'have', 'fortitude', 'stick', 'out', 'courageous', 'young', 'old', 'men', 'Rain', 'Shadow', 'what', 'lengths', 'would', 'go', 'what', 'point', 'endurance', 'would', 'fold', 'IN', 'REALITY', 'how', 'much', 'longer', 'can', 'wait', 'see', 'stunning', 'story', 'determined', 'live', 'drought', 'persevere', 'outback', '6', 'episodes', 'Rain', 'Shadow', 'equal', '5-star', 'movie']",Rain Shadow: Series One
