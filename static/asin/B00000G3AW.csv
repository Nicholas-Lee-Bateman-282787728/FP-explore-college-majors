She LOVES animals and the Lion King (I let her watch LK 1 1/2), which is probably why. Even though some of the reviews on here were unfavorable, I just knew she would really like this one because of those two things. She also loves Mickey but was not bothered in the least that he isn't the star of this show, and she really likes the host Flik.This video was filmed in The Animal Kingdom at the WDW Resort and features actual shows and attractions from that park. The scenes, characters and music are very good. It is more educational than just pure fun like the other Sing-Alongs since it touches on not only animals, but also African and Asian culture. The only part I don't like is ""I Wanna Be Like You."" The people dressed up as gorillas look REEEALLY strange... but it doesn't bother her, of course.The songs are:Welcome to HarambeOn SafariI Wanna Be Like You (The Jungle Book)You Must Have Been a Beautiful BabyWalk the Dinosaur (Was, Not Was)It's a Bug's World (Based on It's a Small World)Asia (Based on the Siamese Cat Song)He Lives in You (The Lion King 2: Simba's Pride)Circle of Life (The Lion King)",4,Great for kids who love animals!,1307577600,"06 9, 2011",2011,1182,"['3', 'year', 'old', 'first', 'saw', '26', 'months', 'still', 'LOVES', 'animals', 'Lion', 'King', 'let', 'watch', 'LK', '1', '1/2', 'probably', 'why', 'Even', 'reviews', 'here', 'were', 'unfavorable', 'just', 'knew', 'would', 'really', 'like', 'one', 'two', 'things', 'also', 'Mickey', 'was', 'not', 'bothered', 'least', ""n't"", 'star', 'show', 'really', 'host', 'Flik.This', 'video', 'was', 'filmed', 'Animal', 'Kingdom', 'WDW', 'Resort', 'actual', 'shows', 'attractions', 'park', 'scenes', 'characters', 'music', 'are', 'very', 'good', 'more', 'educational', 'just', 'pure', 'fun', 'other', 'Sing-Alongs', 'not', 'only', 'animals', 'also', 'African', 'Asian', 'culture', 'only', 'part', 'do', ""n't"", 'like', 'Wan', 'na', 'Be', 'people', 'dressed', 'up', 'gorillas', 'look', 'REEEALLY', 'strange', ""n't"", 'bother', 'course.The', 'songs', 'are', 'Welcome', 'HarambeOn', 'SafariI', 'Wan', 'na', 'Be', 'Jungle', 'Book', 'Must', 'Have', 'Been', 'Beautiful', 'BabyWalk', 'Dinosaur', 'Was', 'Not', 'Was', 'Bug', 'World', 'Based', 'Small', 'World', 'Asia', 'Based', 'Siamese', 'Cat', 'Song', 'Lion', 'King', '2', 'Simba', 'Pride', 'Circle', 'Life', 'Lion', 'King']",Sing Along Songs: Flik's Musical Adventure at Disney's Animal Kingdom VHS
501072,AO8JPQ7HAVLLM,B00000G3AW,JB Zimmerman,"[0, 0]","Ugh...wish I could return this dvd.  My almost 3 year old LOVES the other sing-along dvd's we own (Campout, Beach Party, Disney Land) so I was happy that Santa decided to add this one to her collection.  She was super excited for us to watch it...she watched less than 1/3 of it before she lost interest.  I was disappointed as well, as this did not live up to my expectations compared to the other 3 sing-alongs we have.  Many of the songs are boring or not familiar, there is too much time between songs which makes it boring, the kids are barely featured and the scenes shift so frequently during the songs that I felt dizzy and nauseated after watching it.  During one 2 minute song, the scene changed 37 times (that I could count)...barely enough time for your brain to register one scene before it quickly switches to the next.  We will not be watching this one again.",1,Terrible and disappointing...skip this one,1387929600,"12 25, 2013",2013,874,"['Ugh', 'wish', 'could', 'return', 'dvd', 'almost', '3', 'year', 'old', 'LOVES', 'other', 'sing-along', 'dvd', 'own', 'Campout', 'Beach', 'Party', 'Disney', 'Land', 'was', 'happy', 'Santa', 'decided', 'add', 'one', 'collection', 'was', 'super', 'excited', 'watch', 'watched', 'less', '1/3', 'lost', 'interest', 'was', 'disappointed', 'as', 'well', 'did', 'not', 'live', 'up', 'expectations', 'compared', 'other', '3', 'sing-alongs', 'have', 'Many', 'songs', 'are', 'boring', 'not', 'familiar', 'too', 'much', 'time', 'songs', 'boring', 'kids', 'are', 'barely', 'featured', 'scenes', 'shift', 'so', 'frequently', 'songs', 'felt', 'dizzy', 'nauseated', 'watching', 'one', '2', 'minute', 'song', 'scene', 'changed', '37', 'times', 'could', 'count', 'barely', 'enough', 'time', 'brain', 'register', 'one', 'scene', 'quickly', 'next', 'will', 'not', 'be', 'watching', 'one', 'again']",Sing Along Songs: Flik's Musical Adventure at Disney's Animal Kingdom VHS
