445880,A3MV1KKHX51FYT,6305066876,Acute Observer,"[1, 1]","Patterns, 1956 filmThis drama about a corporation was a shocking success on TV, and then turned into a movie. It introduced writer Rod Serling from Binghamton NY to the nation. He also wrote stories for the ""Twilight Zone"" TV show. This story begins at the Ramsey Building in lower Manhattan, near Wall Street. The secretaries get coffee and gossip. A man directs people to the correct elevator. Mr. Ramsey has a private elevator. Men operate elevators. Note the Studebaker in the street. Men wear hats. A special elevator goes to the Tower, the Executive offices. Staples arrives and sees his grand office, a change from a small town. Staples trained as an engineer before working in ""Industrial Relations"". Briggs talks to him; his secretary Marge was reassigned to the new man. Briggs had been out on a medical absence. [Catch the hints?]The top executives hold a meeting. They took over a small business that went bankrupt, and will keep it shut down for six months. This unemployment will lower wages when it is reopened. The conversation reveals the personalities. [Often a big company buys a small company to shut it down to eliminate competition.] Staples sent a representative to audit the plant. They worry about a strike at another plant. Briggs' son is given a shotgun for his birthday. [Another lost freedom.] Staples is kept busy at his job. Briggs can't be a ""yes man"". Ramsey doesn't like those who question his decisions. Staples has a party at his home for the other executives and their wives. Ramsey reads his report and likes it. They discuss Briggs; is he hard to replace? Ramsey explains his outlook; some say its ruthless. Staples still wants this job. Briggs' son has talent in planning ahead and scheduling; his father works late. [Has Briggs lost his edge?] Staples looks at everything, not just logistics. Briggs misses the old days in running a business when the manager had a personal relationship with each employee. [Does the movie start to get too talky here?]Briggs is a top-level executive; he can't be fired but he can be harassed. Why doesn't he quit? Stubborn or emotional? [Maybe he has to put a son through college?] Note the paperwork and manual typewriters. ""Print it, Miss Fleming."" Note how a conglomerate owns dissimilar businesses; they can only measure by numbers, not from experience. Ramsey runs the meeting. ""You have no right to say that."" Will Briggs resign? Will this stress cause a problem? ""Five minutes ago."" Ramsey built his corporation by making correct decisions, not by altruism. His judgment won't be trumped. Staples thinks he wants a change, this is not the life he wants. He goes to tell off Ramsey and resign. Ramsey explains how he must compete and excel in business or fall behind. Will Ramsey offer Staples a huge raise? Staples thinks it over and accepts the challenge. ""It begins.""""The Man in the Gray Flannel Suit"" has a similar story from that era. Then and now it was unusual to see a drama about top management. The 1950s saw the end of many small businesses. Local businesses kept wealth in the area, big corporations drained away wealth. Neighborhoods declined while suburbs were developed from farmland. Cars became a necessity, and so too oil. Will the passage of time and changing conditions show this policy to be in error? Another effect was organized activities for youth. Instead of playing when and what they chose, play or sports became regimented, an attack on democracy. Children became consumers instead of producers. The lack of space for play was another limitation for children.",5,Life in a Conglomerate,1305417600,"05 15, 2011",2011,3569,"['Patterns', '1956', 'filmThis', 'drama', 'corporation', 'was', 'shocking', 'success', 'TV', 'then', 'turned', 'movie', 'introduced', 'writer', 'Rod', 'Serling', 'Binghamton', 'NY', 'nation', 'also', 'wrote', 'stories', 'Twilight', 'Zone', 'TV', 'show', 'story', 'Ramsey', 'Building', 'lower', 'Manhattan', 'Wall', 'Street', 'secretaries', 'get', 'coffee', 'gossip', 'man', 'people', 'correct', 'elevator', 'Mr.', 'Ramsey', 'private', 'elevator', 'Men', 'operate', 'elevators', 'Note', 'Studebaker', 'street', 'wear', 'hats', 'special', 'elevator', 'Tower', 'Executive', 'offices', 'Staples', 'grand', 'office', 'change', 'small', 'town', 'Staples', 'trained', 'engineer', 'working', 'Industrial', 'Relations', 'Briggs', 'talks', 'secretary', 'Marge', 'was', 'reassigned', 'new', 'man', 'Briggs', 'had', 'been', 'out', 'medical', 'absence', 'Catch', 'hints', 'top', 'executives', 'hold', 'meeting', 'took', 'over', 'small', 'business', 'went', 'bankrupt', 'will', 'keep', 'shut', 'down', 'six', 'months', 'unemployment', 'will', 'lower', 'wages', 'when', 'reopened', 'conversation', 'personalities', '[', 'Often', 'big', 'company', 'small', 'company', 'shut', 'down', 'eliminate', 'competition', ']', 'Staples', 'sent', 'representative', 'audit', 'plant', 'worry', 'strike', 'plant', 'Briggs', 'son', 'given', 'shotgun', 'birthday', '[', 'lost', 'freedom', ']', 'Staples', 'kept', 'busy', 'job', 'Briggs', 'ca', ""n't"", 'be', 'yes', 'man', 'Ramsey', ""n't"", 'like', 'who', 'question', 'decisions', 'Staples', 'party', 'home', 'other', 'executives', 'wives', 'Ramsey', 'report', 'discuss', 'Briggs', 'hard', 'replace', 'Ramsey', 'outlook', 'say', 'ruthless', 'Staples', 'still', 'job', 'Briggs', 'son', 'talent', 'planning', 'ahead', 'scheduling', 'father', 'late', '[', 'Has', 'Briggs', 'lost', 'edge', ']', 'Staples', 'everything', 'not', 'just', 'logistics', 'Briggs', 'old', 'days', 'running', 'business', 'when', 'manager', 'had', 'personal', 'relationship', 'employee', '[', 'movie', 'start', 'get', 'too', 'talky', 'here', ']', 'Briggs', 'top-level', 'executive', 'ca', ""n't"", 'be', 'fired', 'can', 'be', 'harassed', 'Why', ""n't"", 'quit', 'Stubborn', 'emotional', '[', 'Maybe', 'put', 'son', 'college', ']', 'Note', 'paperwork', 'manual', 'typewriters', 'Print', 'Miss', 'Fleming', 'Note', 'how', 'conglomerate', 'dissimilar', 'businesses', 'can', 'only', 'measure', 'numbers', 'not', 'experience', 'Ramsey', 'meeting', 'have', 'right', 'say', 'Will', 'Briggs', 'resign', 'Will', 'stress', 'cause', 'problem', 'Five', 'minutes', 'ago', 'Ramsey', 'built', 'corporation', 'making', 'correct', 'decisions', 'not', 'altruism', 'judgment', 'wo', ""n't"", 'be', 'trumped', 'Staples', 'change', 'not', 'life', 'tell', 'off', 'Ramsey', 'resign', 'Ramsey', 'how', 'must', 'compete', 'excel', 'business', 'fall', 'behind', 'Will', 'Ramsey', 'offer', 'huge', 'raise', 'Staples', 'accepts', 'challenge', 'Man', 'Gray', 'Flannel', 'Suit', 'similar', 'story', 'era', 'Then', 'now', 'was', 'unusual', 'see', 'drama', 'top', 'management', '1950s', 'saw', 'end', 'many', 'small', 'businesses', 'Local', 'businesses', 'kept', 'wealth', 'area', 'big', 'corporations', 'drained', 'away', 'wealth', 'Neighborhoods', 'declined', 'suburbs', 'were', 'developed', 'farmland', 'Cars', 'became', 'necessity', 'so', 'too', 'oil', 'Will', 'passage', 'time', 'changing', 'conditions', 'show', 'policy', 'be', 'error', 'effect', 'was', 'organized', 'activities', 'youth', 'Instead', 'playing', 'when', 'what', 'chose', 'play', 'sports', 'became', 'regimented', 'attack', 'democracy', 'Children', 'became', 'consumers', 'instead', 'producers', 'lack', 'space', 'play', 'was', 'limitation', 'children']",N/A

However, I will give you an opinion of the story and the acting which hopefully will persuade you to purchase the DVD and watch it as an object lesson in how NOT to ruin your life.The acting is excellent and the camera work, scene transitions, sound (or the absence of it) and lighting all add up to make a fine film. The emotions displayed seem very real and if your hands aren't sweating during the intense scenes, you may need to check for a pulse. The mean-spirited big boss' acting is a bit over-the-top, I would have opted for a more subtle performance. But all other actors do a great job of being the suck-ups that most corporate types end up being at some point in their careers. The women are little more than props in a story line that takes place when the women were not yet in any positions of power and men were in charge of everything. That said, each does a great job at being there when needed and swallowing great amounts of personal pride or, as in the case of one nervy secretary, leaving the company.I've worked at two large corporations. Watching this film was, for me, like watching parts of the story of my own life.  In both instances, I was either forced out for not kissing butt or played with like some kind of pawn in a game for the ""big boys"" at the top. I left the last one with my dignity intact in order to start my own company and I've never looked back.The sad part is this film storyline ends up having the main character shed all dignity and accept more money to stay in bed with a snake. Probably true to life, but his character's transformation into a lizard is very creepy and more than a little disgusting. I'm glad that there was no time to really invest any feelings toward that character; just when you think he's going to be a hero, he's turns even nastier and profit-driven than the boss. That's the very attitude (taking more money instead of simply standing for ANY principle) which has turned the world into a pit of mindless, money-grubbing robots in suits. And it started well before 1956, the year this film came out. If you are a business shark, you'll love the ending. If you have a soul, you won't. And without a doubt, the two mindsets are totally exclusive.",4,Strong Story & Excellent Acting,1294617600,"01 10, 2011",2011,2341,"['many', 'reviewers', 'have', 'already', 'given', 'entire', 'plot', 'trying', 'add', 'anything', 'new', 'lines', 'However', 'will', 'give', 'opinion', 'story', 'acting', 'hopefully', 'will', 'persuade', 'purchase', 'DVD', 'watch', 'object', 'lesson', 'how', 'NOT', 'ruin', 'life.The', 'acting', 'excellent', 'camera', 'work', 'scene', 'transitions', 'sound', 'absence', 'lighting', 'add', 'up', 'make', 'fine', 'film', 'emotions', 'displayed', 'seem', 'very', 'real', 'hands', 'are', ""n't"", 'sweating', 'intense', 'scenes', 'may', 'need', 'check', 'pulse', 'mean-spirited', 'big', 'boss', 'acting', 'bit', 'over-the-top', 'would', 'have', 'opted', 'more', 'subtle', 'performance', 'other', 'actors', 'do', 'great', 'job', 'being', 'suck-ups', 'most', 'corporate', 'types', 'end', 'up', 'being', 'point', 'careers', 'women', 'are', 'little', 'more', 'props', 'story', 'line', 'place', 'when', 'women', 'were', 'not', 'yet', 'positions', 'power', 'men', 'were', 'charge', 'everything', 'said', 'great', 'job', 'being', 'when', 'needed', 'swallowing', 'great', 'amounts', 'personal', 'pride', 'case', 'one', 'nervy', 'secretary', 'leaving', 'company.I', ""'ve"", 'worked', 'two', 'large', 'corporations', 'Watching', 'film', 'was', 'watching', 'parts', 'story', 'own', 'life', 'instances', 'was', 'either', 'forced', 'out', 'not', 'kissing', 'butt', 'played', 'kind', 'pawn', 'game', 'big', 'boys', 'top', 'left', 'last', 'one', 'dignity', 'intact', 'order', 'start', 'own', 'company', ""'ve"", 'never', 'looked', 'back.The', 'sad', 'part', 'film', 'storyline', 'up', 'having', 'main', 'character', 'shed', 'dignity', 'accept', 'more', 'money', 'stay', 'bed', 'snake', 'Probably', 'true', 'life', 'character', 'transformation', 'lizard', 'very', 'creepy', 'more', 'little', 'disgusting', ""'m"", 'glad', 'was', 'time', 'really', 'invest', 'feelings', 'character', 'just', 'when', 'think', 'going', 'be', 'hero', 'turns', 'even', 'nastier', 'profit-driven', 'boss', 'very', 'attitude', 'taking', 'more', 'money', 'instead', 'simply', 'standing', 'ANY', 'principle', 'turned', 'world', 'pit', 'mindless', 'money-grubbing', 'robots', 'suits', 'started', 'well', '1956', 'year', 'film', 'came', 'out', 'are', 'business', 'shark', ""'ll"", 'love', 'ending', 'have', 'soul', 'wo', ""n't"", 'doubt', 'two', 'mindsets', 'are', 'totally', 'exclusive']",N/A

445883,A1SP38JKYFFVJS,6305066876,Caesar M. Warrington,"[4, 4]","PATTERNS was Rod Serling's breakthrough in television, earning him a much deserved Emmy and industry recognition. This 1956 teleplay, directed by Fielder Cook, was so popular it was the first ever television show to be broadcast a second time.PATTERNS is an uncompromising morality tale about the Machiavellian world of Big Business. Fred Staples (played by Van Heflin) is the new guy suddenly transferred from somewhere in Ohio to the company's New York headquarters. Staples soon discovers that the company head, Walter Ramsey (Everett Sloane), is intending to use him as a replacement for the kind-hearted-but-aging vice-president, William Briggs (Ed Begley). Ramsey places no value on the virtues of friendship or loyalty. The only things mattering to him is the company's production and profit. Staples sees things differently. Briggs had befriended him and he refuses to surrender his values to his ambition and go along with the cutthroat tactics of his boss. Unknown to Staples is that his wife, Nancy (Beatrice Straight), is not above compromising. Nancy Staples enjoys the prosperity and status of being the wife of a rising executive and is willing to work with the ruthless Ramsey to keep them.The power to PATTERNS is Ramsey's fierce determination to edge out Briggs with Staples. It doesn't matter how obvious Staples makes it known he despises Ramsey and his worldview, even to the point of Staples giving him a warning and a threat that if he ever was to give in and take over from Briggs that his sole determination would be to thereafter edge him out, taking it all. Ramsey commends Staples hatred, for him such threats and desires confirm why he needs Staples for the company. Ramsey is a disciple for competitiveness unbound and will foster its spread and development even if he is to be one of its victims. Here we see what he truly depises in Briggs is the love he has for friends and family. Briggs' loyalty and duty to the memory of Ramsey's father and founder of this company stands for everything Ramsey finds maudlin and weak. For Ramsey, corrupting Staples is the same as corrupting his late father's cherished business ethics and firing Briggs is a symbol of replacing his father's world with his own.This Roan Group edition features an interesting and informative introduction from New York Post film critic Lou Lumenick.",5,Made Rod Serling A Name In Television,1132531200,"11 21, 2005",2005,2351,"['PATTERNS', 'was', 'Rod', 'Serling', 'breakthrough', 'television', 'earning', 'much', 'deserved', 'Emmy', 'industry', 'recognition', '1956', 'teleplay', 'directed', 'Fielder', 'Cook', 'was', 'so', 'popular', 'was', 'first', 'ever', 'television', 'show', 'be', 'broadcast', 'second', 'time.PATTERNS', 'uncompromising', 'morality', 'tale', 'Machiavellian', 'world', 'Big', 'Business', 'Fred', 'Staples', 'played', 'Van', 'Heflin', 'new', 'guy', 'suddenly', 'transferred', 'somewhere', 'Ohio', 'company', 'New', 'York', 'headquarters', 'Staples', 'soon', 'company', 'head', 'Walter', 'Ramsey', 'Everett', 'Sloane', 'intending', 'use', 'replacement', 'kind-hearted-but-aging', 'vice-president', 'William', 'Briggs', 'Ed', 'Begley', 'Ramsey', 'value', 'virtues', 'friendship', 'loyalty', 'only', 'things', 'mattering', 'company', 'production', 'profit', 'Staples', 'things', 'differently', 'Briggs', 'had', 'befriended', 'surrender', 'values', 'ambition', 'go', 'along', 'cutthroat', 'tactics', 'boss', 'Staples', 'wife', 'Nancy', 'Beatrice', 'Straight', 'not', 'compromising', 'Nancy', 'Staples', 'prosperity', 'status', 'being', 'wife', 'rising', 'executive', 'willing', 'work', 'ruthless', 'Ramsey', 'keep', 'them.The', 'power', 'PATTERNS', 'Ramsey', 'fierce', 'determination', 'edge', 'out', 'Briggs', 'Staples', ""n't"", 'matter', 'how', 'obvious', 'Staples', 'Ramsey', 'worldview', 'even', 'point', 'Staples', 'giving', 'warning', 'threat', 'ever', 'was', 'give', 'take', 'over', 'Briggs', 'sole', 'determination', 'would', 'be', 'thereafter', 'edge', 'out', 'taking', 'Ramsey', 'Staples', 'hatred', 'such', 'threats', 'desires', 'confirm', 'why', 'Staples', 'company', 'Ramsey', 'disciple', 'competitiveness', 'unbound', 'will', 'foster', 'spread', 'development', 'even', 'be', 'one', 'victims', 'Here', 'see', 'what', 'truly', 'Briggs', 'love', 'friends', 'family', 'Briggs', 'loyalty', 'duty', 'memory', 'Ramsey', 'father', 'founder', 'company', 'everything', 'Ramsey', 'maudlin', 'weak', 'Ramsey', 'corrupting', 'Staples', 'same', 'corrupting', 'late', 'father', 'cherished', 'business', 'ethics', 'firing', 'Briggs', 'symbol', 'replacing', 'father', 'world', 'own.This', 'Roan', 'Group', 'edition', 'interesting', 'informative', 'introduction', 'New', 'York', 'Post', 'film', 'critic', 'Lou', 'Lumenick']",N/A
445884,A2E3F04ZK7FG66,6305066876,calvinnme,"[3, 3]","...Thus utters the President of a company in a showdown with the film's protagonist. This sums up this film the same way ""Greed is Good"" sums up Wall Street 30 years later.This movie is very good at portending the future of American business 25 years before the age of the billionaire-boys-who-won't-grow-up and right-sizing began in the early 80's. Fred Staples (Van Heflin) is the 30-something industrial relations expert at a small plant in Ohio that has been bought by Walter Ramsey's (Everett Sloane's) company. He is courted by Ramsey for an executive position at the parent company's headquarters in New York. He arrives full of small town values and good ideas, and really likes his new boss, VP William Briggs (Ed Begley).However, soon he realizes what is really happening. He hasn't been hired to help Briggs, he's been hired to replace him. There is no love lost between Briggs and Ramsey. Briggs, at 62, sees Ramsey as only in the President's chair because his dad started the company. Briggs also sees Ramsey as discounting the human element, thinking it a small thing to shut down a plant for six months while it retools although it comprises half the payroll of the village in which it sits. Ramsey says in the long run the village will be better off because the retooled plant will employ twice as many people as before. Briggs sees growth as something coming from the productivity and loyalty of the employees. Ramsey sees the need for acquisitions as a tool for growth in a world of ruthless competition.Fred is put in the middle of all of this. Hand-picked by Ramsey, he sees reports that he and Briggs worked on together having total credit given to himself. Briggs' secretary of seven years is taken from Briggs and given to Fred. Basically, Ramsey is choking Briggs out with a death of a thousand cuts and small humiliations. In these days it still wasn't fashionable to fire employees with 30 years of tenure, so Ramsey hopes to get Briggs to resign. Fred protests all of this - to some degree - but even he admits to his wife he doesn't protest too much because he wants this job. It's not about the money, but the challenge. Ramsey realizes this and exploits this knowledge to ultimately corrupt Fred, all the while having Fred believe that he has won his round with the devil.Actually, both Ramsey and Briggs have valid points in how to best run the business. Ramsey may be portraying the ruthless side of the business in this film, but in today's world he would be considered a humanitarian. He wouldn't be retooling a plant to double its size. He'd be shipping the jobs overseas, and he wouldn't give a second thought to outright firing someone he thought was too old for the job regardless of years of service. Written by Rod Serling, this film is scary in how accurate it is in depicting today's business world. The performances are wonderful. Ed Begley, so often playing the heavy, is poignant as the aging VP trying to hold on to a place in the world where he still feels he has value while trying to raise a teenage son. Beatrice Straight has a small but important role as Fred's wife who tries to get him to be honest with himself about his own motivations.

445885,A30N4CJVI6U4XE,6305066876,"Chris Wilson ""Chris Kent""","[1, 1]","Sometimes you stumble across a film and are stunned by its greatness. The 1956 work ""Patterns"" is one of those films. A timeless drama about the political machinations of a New York corporation, much of the story takes place within the cathedral-like expanse of a board room. Here, adorned in suits and ties and catered to by a gaggle of secretaries, high-level executives discuss finances and draw lines in the sand. Akin to generals forging plans for D-Day, these executives are responsible for decisions affecting thousands of lives. A senior executive, long past his prime, is in the doghouse. A young gun uncomfortably realizes he's been hired to replace him. So begins a heartbreaking battle of wills.I should have known when reading Rod Serling's name in the credits I was in for fascinating drama. One of America's greatest writers (Serling: The Rise and Twilight of Television's Last Angry Man) who forged his craft through TV, ""Patterns"" was a feature-length screenplay penned early in his career. Best known for ""The Twilight Zone"" (The Twilight Zone: The Complete Series [Blu-ray]), Serling was a notorious writeaholic who recited screenplays at a furious clip. ""Patterns"" was first performed as a live TV drama on ""Kraft Theater"" in 1955, an era when plays and original screenplays were a staple of primetime. It became one of the most popular teleplays of the day, with a rare encore performance and evolving into this film.Serling would win one of six writing Emmys (a record that stands today) for this story. He would follow this work with ""Requiem for a Heavyweight"" (Playhouse 90 - Requiem for a Heavyweight [VHS]), ""A Town Turned to Dust,"" ""The Comedian"" (Rod Serling's The Comedian (Playhouse 90) [VHS]), ""The Rack"" and then the furiously creative five-year run of ""The Twilight Zone."" The inferior ""Night Gallery"" (Night Gallery - The Complete First Season) followed, which Serling was weary of by its 1973 conclusion, and the brightly burning workaholic, a heavy smoking ""angry young man"" of Syracuse, New York with liberal ideals and a fascination with the human condition, would pass on before his time at the age of 50.You will find no musical score in ""Patterns,"" with the exception of a solemn church bell tolling during the credits. Like ants, executives scurry into a building and fight for the elevator. Fred Staples, played by the great character actor Van Heflin, is starting his first day. He kisses his wife (Beatrice Straight) and jogs towards a looming skyscraper. He is guided into his large office decorated with early American furniture. Here he meets ""neighbor"" William Briggs, a likable company elder statesman played by the incomparable Ed Begley. As they discuss his past, Briggs senses the similarity of their backgrounds with ominous premonition.The rigid CEO Walter Ramsey (Everett Sloane) appears at the first board meeting. Staples witnesses first-hand the animosity between Ramsey and Briggs as a disagreement erupts like wildfire. With instant epiphany, he recognizes he's been hired as a pawn to force Briggs' resignation. The irony of ""Patterns"" is Staples' ideas are akin to Briggs' as they seek innovative solutions allowing the company's workforce to remain employed (the euphemism ""downsize"" did not exist in 1956).""Patterns"" has great relevance today, detailed in such recent films asCompany Men. Should a company's philosophy involve making larger amounts of money or protecting its loyal workforce? Ramsey's goal is apparent, and he resents Briggs' contradictory opinion. He can't fire the man after 30 years, thus an ugly chess game of subtle humiliation ensues. When Staples attempts to explain his concerns to his wife, he's surprised when she essentially tells him to play along. Ramsey has purchased them a beautiful house in the New York suburbs, and she's not ready to give up such status.In this era of gimmicky blockbusters, it's a joy to view a drama driven by human motivation. By the end of ""Patterns,"" you realize a canvas of art has been created from Serling's breathtaking pen. These are troubled souls trying to forge decent lives within a culture driven by money or, in the mantra of Michael Douglas years later inWall Street, ""Greed is good."" I was also reminded of Sidney Lumet's classicTwelve Angry Men, another drama having its roots in live TV. That film also plays almost entirely within a single room. You will find no explosions within these intimate walls, where verbal words are the mightiest special effect.The final conflict is a showdown between Staples and Ramsey, a brilliant storm of perceptive dialogue. The conclusion can be interpreted several ways, as Serling well knows. Staples essentially sells out, but on his terms. One wonders if he'll be able to stay afloat and and remain true to his ideals, counter to the corporation's looming fiscal beliefs. Or will he become one of the suits sitting at that endlessly long board table, robotic tools ducking their collective head when someone has the audacity to question the dictator?""Patterns,"" decades

In that film, Peck has to chose between giving everything to his company vs. spending some time with his wife and family. His boss is actually quite understanding about this, but the tension between the demands of the corporate world and the employee's personal life are well portrayed.Here we see that world pushed to its extreme, one where nothing is valued but complete efficiency and ruthlessness. Friendship, loyalty, ethics, family values, and humanitarian ideals of any kind are obsolete and basically worthless. In fact, they are openly despised by the president of the company, played in a role of great intensity by Everett Sloane. All that matters is the bottom line and whatever it takes to keep making a profit and grow the company no matter how it impacts the lives of its employees.It's an amazingly prescient movie if you consider it was made in 1956 when America still dominated almost every major market and U.S. industry hadn't yet gone into its death spiral. During the late 40s and 50s American goods flooded the world, bringing wealth and prosperity to a post-WWII America. It could be argued that such efficiency and ruthlessness weren't yet necessary in 1956, but a few decades later in the late 80s and early 90s American companies  were laying off older, higher paid employees as well anyone who wasn't absolutely essential, beefing up top executive packages for making corporations run leaner and meaner, which eventually led to the massive outsourcings of jobs in the 2000s in a final desperate attempt to maintain profitability. It could be said to have succeeded--if success is making anyone over 50 and even 40 in many cases unemployable.Here Rod Serling--always a little bit ahead of his time and with his finger on the pulse--hits the nail on the head with this hard-hitting, powerful melodrama of exploitative, mean-spirited, and Machiavellian corporate politics. Despite the 50s ambience and speech, it's a world recognizable by any corporate employee today.Sadly, it's a corporate world that no sane person would want. Unfortunately, when money is the only God or sole good then nothing else matters but the bottom line. That ethos (or rather, lack of one) is likely here to stay given the state of world economics.

Flanked by his pocket shark an equally heartless cold fish head office manager named Ms Lannier whose job it is see things get done to Mr Ramseys liking.  Ms Lannier is totally business like in ways ruthless and effcient also patrols the corporate executive halls of Ramsey Company making sure everyone is fully engaged in towing their part of the corporate load.There's the rub, one member of Ramsey's executive staff one Mr. Briggs is definately NOT pulling what Ramsey feels is his part of the corporate load.  Ramsey made sure something was done quietly to address the situation involving a faltering doddering unsatisfactory efforts of Mr Briggs.  That nice Mr. Staples a from a factory out in the corn midwest somewheres a man who is an Industrial Engineer by profession and people person by instinct was hired to help failing Mr. Briggs supposedly as an assistant!

Mr Ramsey rides Briggs without mercy never letting up on beating down poor old Mr Briggs for even one moment.  This is class corporate warfare where the object is to destroy your enemies with pen, ink and properly used words.  Ramsey was ably helped by his hench-woman Ms lannier who spread thick the bloody chum of rumours that suggested that Briggs days at the Ramsey Company firm were numbered best in smaller single digits.Ramsey the consumate corporate shark swim circles around old skool trusting kind Mr Briggs a throwback to the humane gentility of a bygone day.  Ramsey an middle aged man himself embraced the new cut throat bigger is better and do anything to get bigger business mantality.  To Ramsey Briggs was a fossil touting old world corporate virtues of loyal to workers when Ramsey wanted a hard cold bootom line oriented plan to grow the company andif workers had to suffer along the way so be it if their suffering makes the company bigger, stronger and hence more competitive.Staples was the man with the plans Ramsey wanted to hear and Ramsey said so to Briggs at every turn.  Ramsey really lays into Briggs with a gusto only a saddist could love, I mean this was mean so bad I think it would turn stomachs in todays borad rooms.  Briggs body falling apart driven to hard drinking first thing in the morning and in secret at work and home is a broken man.  Briggs however has a pair and as such will not let Ramswy just force him out like a used shoe.  What happens next.  Will Briggs finally get the message and leave.  Will Mr Staples a genuinely nice man stay with Ramsey and company after seeing the perfectly evil things Ramsey will do to force Briggs out.Man this is an awesome DVD and to find out all those things you mustbuy the DVD it is worth it and then some.I will address the quality of the transfer before ending.  the quality of this transfer is the best I have seen.  I have seen the Kenetiscope version that was done for TV which is horrible, scratchy, too white uneven grainy beyond beleif and sound quality I would not wish on anyone.  I saw a VHS version that was only barely passable.  This DVD version is by FAR superior when compared to both the VHS and the Keniscope versions I have seen.  This version of patterns is not perfect but it is so much better than everything else I have seen under this title that if I were you I'd grab this DVD of Patterns while it is available at Amazon.com like I did.  I would not be a Happy Wolf Dude without a good qaulity DVD copy of patterns in my collection.",5,Patterns - PROVES GREED WAS GOOD BEFORE WALL STREET - AN AWESOME TRANSFER TOO!,1162684800,"11 5, 2006",2006,3818,"['DVD', 'Greed', 'Was', 'Good', 'Big', 'Business', 'long', 'Movie', 'Wall', 'Street', 'now', 'infamous', 'phrase', 'Greed', 'Good', 'Mr', 'Ramsey', 'Ramsey', 'Companies', 'brutally', 'driven', 'man', 'small', 'stature', 'gigantic', 'business', 'domain', 'rules', 'tyrant', 'Flanked', 'pocket', 'shark', 'equally', 'heartless', 'cold', 'fish', 'head', 'office', 'manager', 'named', 'Ms', 'Lannier', 'job', 'see', 'things', 'get', 'done', 'Mr', 'Ramseys', 'liking', 'Ms', 'Lannier', 'totally', 'business', 'ways', 'ruthless', 'effcient', 'also', 'corporate', 'executive', 'halls', 'Ramsey', 'Company', 'making', 'sure', 'everyone', 'fully', 'engaged', 'towing', 'part', 'corporate', 'load.There', 'rub', 'one', 'member', 'Ramsey', 'executive', 'staff', 'one', 'Mr.', 'Briggs', 'definately', 'NOT', 'pulling', 'what', 'Ramsey', 'feels', 'part', 'corporate', 'load', 'Ramsey', 'made', 'sure', 'something', 'was', 'done', 'quietly', 'address', 'situation', 'involving', 'faltering', 'doddering', 'unsatisfactory', 'efforts', 'Mr', 'Briggs', 'nice', 'Mr', 'factory', 'out', 'corn', 'midwest', 'man', 'who', 'Industrial', 'Engineer', 'profession', 'people', 'person', 'instinct', 'was', 'hired', 'help', 'failing', 'Mr.', 'Briggs', 'supposedly', 'assistant', 'are', 'things', 'ever', 'what', 'seem', 'business', 'NOPE', 'later', 'revealed', 'Mr', 'Staples', 'Mr.', 'Briggs', 'replacement', 'then', 'dye', 'cast', 'Mr', 'Ramsey', 'Briggs', 'mercy', 'never', 'letting', 'up', 'beating', 'down', 'poor', 'old', 'Mr', 'Briggs', 'even', 'one', 'moment', 'class', 'corporate', 'warfare', 'where', 'object', 'destroy', 'enemies', 'pen', 'ink', 'properly', 'used', 'words', 'Ramsey', 'was', 'ably', 'helped', 'hench-woman', 'Ms', 'lannier', 'who', 'spread', 'thick', 'bloody', 'chum', 'rumours', 'suggested', 'Briggs', 'days', 'Ramsey', 'Company', 'firm', 'were', 'numbered', 'best', 'smaller', 'single', 'digits.Ramsey', 'consumate', 'corporate', 'shark', 'swim', 'circles', 'old', 'skool', 'trusting', 'kind', 'Mr', 'Briggs', 'throwback', 'humane', 'gentility', 'bygone', 'day', 'Ramsey', 'middle', 'aged', 'man', 'embraced', 'new', 'cut', 'throat', 'bigger', 'better', 'do', 'anything', 'get', 'bigger', 'business', 'mantality', 'Ramsey', 'Briggs', 'was', 'fossil', 'touting', 'old', 'world', 'corporate', 'virtues', 'loyal', 'workers', 'when', 'Ramsey', 'wanted', 'hard', 'cold', 'bootom', 'line', 'oriented', 'plan', 'grow', 'company', 'workers', 'had', 'suffer', 'way', 'so', 'be', 'suffering', 'company', 'bigger', 'stronger', 'hence', 'more', 'competitive.Staples', 'was', 'man', 'plans', 'Ramsey', 'wanted', 'hear', 'Ramsey', 'said', 'so', 'Briggs', 'turn', 'Ramsey', 'really', 'Briggs', 'gusto', 'only', 'saddist', 'could', 'love', 'mean', 'was', 'mean', 'bad', 'think', 'would', 'turn', 'stomachs', 'todays', 'borad', 'rooms', 'Briggs', 'body', 'falling', 'apart', 'driven', 'hard', 'drinking', 'first', 'thing', 'morning', 'secret', 'work', 'home', 'broken', 'man', 'Briggs', 'however', 'pair', 'such', 'will', 'not', 'let', 'Ramswy', 'just', 'force', 'out', 'used', 'shoe', 'What', 'next', 'Will', 'Briggs', 'finally', 'get', 'message', 'leave', 'Will', 'Mr', 'Staples', 'genuinely', 'nice', 'man', 'stay', 'Ramsey', 'company', 'seeing', 'perfectly', 'evil', 'things', 'Ramsey', 'will', 'do', 'force', 'Briggs', 'out.Man', 'awesome', 'DVD', 'find', 'out', 'things', 'mustbuy', 'DVD', 'then', 'some.I', 'will', 'address', 'quality', 'transfer', 'ending', 'quality', 'transfer', 'best', 'have', 'seen', 'have', 'seen', 'Kenetiscope', 'version', 'was', 'done', 'TV', 'horrible', 'scratchy', 'too', 'white', 'uneven', 'grainy', 'beleif', 'sound', 'quality', 'would', 'not', 'wish', 'anyone', 'saw', 'VHS', 'version', 'was', 'only', 'barely', 'passable', 'DVD', 'version', 'FAR', 'superior', 'when', 'compared', 'VHS', 'Keniscope', 'versions', 'have', 'seen', 'version', 'patterns', 'not', 'perfect', 'so', 'much', 'better', 'everything', 'else', 'have', 'seen', 'title', 'were', ""'d"", 'grab', 'DVD', 'Patterns', 'available', 'Amazon.com', 'did', 'would', 'not', 'be', 'Happy', 'Wolf', 'Dude', 'good', 'qaulity', 'DVD', 'copy', 'patterns', 'collection']",N/A

Others have given the storyline, so I'll not go there. But the Roan dvd needs to be discussed. All the extras are a waste of time. The 1960'd psychidelic presentation has little in common with the seriousness and social statement of 'Patterns."" The quality of the film is a little better than fair (I'm spoiled by the stunning transfers of other films, so I'm being a bit hard on this transfer)but with that being said, if this is all that is available, buy it if you're a Searling fan or want this film on dvd format. I would compare this to '12 Angry Men' in its intensity and insight into human nature the the human condition. It goes over the edge (actingwise) at times, but that's a minor mention. 'Patterns' is one of the great classics of America's film heritage. If you like 'Twilight Zone' you will be happy with this purchase.",4,"5 star film, 3 star reproduction, so I give it 4 star status",1127520000,"09 24, 2005",2005,972,"['First', 'saw', ""'Patterns"", 'one', 'movie', 'channels', 'did', ""n't"", 'know', 'Searling', 'was', 'involved', 'time', 'came', 'surprise', 'Others', 'have', 'given', 'storyline', ""'ll"", 'not', 'go', 'there', 'Roan', 'dvd', 'needs', 'be', 'discussed', 'extras', 'are', 'waste', 'time', '1960', ""'d"", 'psychidelic', 'presentation', 'little', 'common', 'seriousness', 'social', 'statement', ""'Patterns"", 'quality', 'film', 'little', 'better', 'fair', ""'m"", 'spoiled', 'stunning', 'transfers', 'other', 'films', ""'m"", 'being', 'bit', 'hard', 'transfer', 'being', 'said', 'available', 'buy', ""'re"", 'Searling', 'fan', 'want', 'film', 'dvd', 'format', 'would', 'compare', ""'12"", 'Angry', 'Men', 'intensity', 'insight', 'human', 'nature', 'human', 'condition', 'edge', 'actingwise', 'times', 'minor', 'mention', ""'Patterns"", 'one', 'great', 'classics', 'America', 'film', 'heritage', 'like', 'Zone', 'will', 'be', 'happy', 'purchase']",N/A

445902,A3T46X7M3AUDAB,6305066876,William Timothy Lukeman,"[0, 0]","Close to 60 years later, Rod Serling's savage & perceptive drama about the corporate world devouring its own remains as timely & honest as the day it was made. In a world of downsizing & outsourcing, with not only jobs but basic human dignity dwindling as profits for a few soar to stratospheric heights, we look back in time & see that the ugliness was always there. Van Heflin's essentially decent but admittedly ambitious Staples is the modern corporate Everyman, torn between surviving in the business world while still surviving as a human being with some semblance of a soul. How much of yourself do you sell in order to make it? How decent can you be when you've got others depending on your success?Staples is caught between two antagonists, two modes of being: Ed Begley's battered old businessman Briggs, living by ideals from an earlier time; and Everett Sloane's cruelly self-aware CEO Ramsey, whose ruthless, unsparing drive is almost evangelical in its fierce purity. And here Serling is wise enough to show how Staples shares both of their personalities, even if he isn't quite aware of it yet. He does want to do the right thing, see that people retain their jobs while he's making money for the business; but he also has to acknowledge that the business world belongs to people like Ramsey now, and that he'll undoubtedly go far by following Ramsey's path. How much of himself does he save, how much does he cast aside?Serling is too good a writer, too keen an observer of humanity under pressure, to offer anything more than an ambiguous ending. If profit & power are the ultimate goals of life, then Ramsey's your model. If maintaining a balance between profit & people is more important, then it's Briggs. The costs of both models are plain to see. Briggs is old, ill, tired; he's fought the good fight all his life & lost more often than he's won. Ramsey has been successful in his terms of the word, but he's a failure as a human being, a soulless husk whose life won't have any purpose or meaning when he's finally ousted by some younger version of himself. Will that younger version be Staples? We just don't know.An intense, visceral exploration of power & corruption, this classic film is most highly recommended!",5,Even more meaningful today!,1372809600,"07 3, 2013",2013,2239,"['Close', '60', 'years', 'later', 'Rod', 'Serling', 'savage', 'perceptive', 'drama', 'corporate', 'world', 'devouring', 'own', 'remains', 'timely', 'honest', 'day', 'was', 'made', 'world', 'downsizing', 'outsourcing', 'not', 'only', 'jobs', 'basic', 'human', 'dignity', 'dwindling', 'profits', 'few', 'soar', 'stratospheric', 'heights', 'look', 'back', 'time', 'see', 'ugliness', 'was', 'always', 'there', 'Van', 'Heflin', 'essentially', 'decent', 'admittedly', 'ambitious', 'Staples', 'modern', 'corporate', 'Everyman', 'torn', 'surviving', 'business', 'world', 'still', 'surviving', 'human', 'being', 'semblance', 'soul', 'How', 'much', 'do', 'sell', 'order', 'make', 'How', 'decent', 'can', 'be', 'when', ""'ve"", 'got', 'others', 'depending', 'success', 'Staples', 'caught', 'two', 'antagonists', 'two', 'modes', 'being', 'Ed', 'Begley', 'battered', 'old', 'businessman', 'Briggs', 'living', 'ideals', 'earlier', 'time', 'Everett', 'Sloane', 'cruelly', 'self-aware', 'CEO', 'Ramsey', 'ruthless', 'unsparing', 'drive', 'almost', 'evangelical', 'fierce', 'purity', 'here', 'Serling', 'wise', 'enough', 'show', 'how', 'Staples', 'shares', 'personalities', 'even', ""n't"", 'quite', 'aware', 'yet', 'want', 'do', 'right', 'thing', 'see', 'people', 'retain', 'jobs', 'making', 'money', 'business', 'also', 'acknowledge', 'business', 'world', 'people', 'Ramsey', 'now', ""'ll"", 'undoubtedly', 'go', 'far', 'following', 'Ramsey', 'path', 'How', 'much', 'save', 'how', 'much', 'cast', 'aside', 'Serling', 'too', 'good', 'writer', 'too', 'keen', 'observer', 'humanity', 'pressure', 'offer', 'anything', 'more', 'ambiguous', 'ending', 'profit', 'power', 'are', 'ultimate', 'goals', 'life', 'then', 'Ramsey', 'model', 'maintaining', 'balance', 'profit', 'people', 'more', 'important', 'then', 'Briggs', 'costs', 'models', 'are', 'plain', 'see', 'Briggs', 'old', 'ill', 'tired', 'fought', 'good', 'fight', 'life', 'lost', 'more', 'often', 'won', 'Ramsey', 'been', 'successful', 'terms', 'word', 'failure', 'human', 'being', 'soulless', 'husk', 'life', 'wo', ""n't"", 'have', 'purpose', 'meaning', 'when', 'finally', 'ousted', 'younger', 'version', 'Will', 'younger', 'version', 'be', 'Staples', 'just', 'do', ""n't"", 'know.An', 'intense', 'visceral', 'exploration', 'power', 'corruption', 'classic', 'film', 'most', 'highly', 'recommended']",N/A
