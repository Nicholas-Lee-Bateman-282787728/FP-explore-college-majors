855019,AQ8DU6XVA3USJ,B0004GI250,"Alejandra Vernon ""artist & illustrator""","[28, 34]","This is the documentary Sinclair Television Group was to air in its entirety, but after lawyers for Senator Kerry's ""interests"" intimidated and threatened them, they reduced the air time to a small segment. It is too bad that more people didn't get to view this poignant, wrenching film.It contains interviews of POWs who spent anywhere from five to eight years in the dreaded ""Hanoi Hilton"", and includes some horrific footage of the place.It also contains footage of Senator Kerry meeting with his Vietnam Veterans Against the War group, most who look like the same bunch of human debris that caused the riots at the 1968 Democratic Convention.It is not what Senator Kerry did during his time in Vietnam that matters, it's what he did when he came home; I remember the late '60s and early '70s well, consider them the nadir of our history, and have always felt that people like Jane Fonda and John Kerry should have been tried for treason, for inciting anti-war activities that gave comfort to the enemy, lengthened the war, and cost American lives on the battlefield. My opinion of Kerry has not improved, after the attempts to suppress this film, so similar to the goon squad tactics used against the Nader people in this past presidential election. Anyone who saw Lawrence Tribe argue for the DNC in front of the Florida Supreme Court (C-SPAN, 9/17/04) to keep Ralph Nader off the ballot will know what I mean.The heart and soul of this documentary are the seventeen steadfast and heroic men who are interviewed. Their stories are gripping, and their wounds deep, opened again by a man who dared to make Vietnam the cornerstone of his candidacy for the highest office in the land, when he saluted millions of viewers and ""reported for duty"". Having done so, these stories and the memories of those who tell them will follow Kerry for the rest of his public life, ready to surface again no doubt in 2006, if he runs for re-election to the Senate.As George ""Bud"" Day, who was imprisoned and tortured for five years and seven months says, ""this man committed an act of treason. He lied, he besmirched our name and he did it for self-interest. And now he wants us to forget. I can never forget"".Produced and presented by Carlton Sherwood, the total running time is 42 minutes.",5,the documentary John Kerry doesn't want you to see,1099699200,"11 6, 2004",2004,2277,"['documentary', 'Sinclair', 'Television', 'Group', 'was', 'air', 'entirety', 'lawyers', 'Senator', 'Kerry', 'interests', 'intimidated', 'threatened', 'reduced', 'air', 'time', 'small', 'segment', 'too', 'bad', 'more', 'people', 'did', ""n't"", 'get', 'view', 'poignant', 'wrenching', 'film.It', 'interviews', 'POWs', 'who', 'spent', 'anywhere', 'five', 'eight', 'years', 'dreaded', 'Hanoi', 'Hilton', 'horrific', 'footage', 'place.It', 'also', 'footage', 'Senator', 'Kerry', 'meeting', 'Vietnam', 'Veterans', 'Against', 'War', 'group', 'most', 'who', 'look', 'same', 'bunch', 'human', 'debris', 'caused', 'riots', '1968', 'Democratic', 'Convention.It', 'not', 'what', 'Senator', 'Kerry', 'did', 'time', 'Vietnam', 'matters', 'what', 'did', 'when', 'came', 'home', 'remember', 'late', ""'60s"", 'early', ""'70s"", 'well', 'consider', 'nadir', 'history', 'have', 'always', 'felt', 'people', 'Jane', 'Fonda', 'John', 'Kerry', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'tried', 'treason', 'inciting', 'anti-war', 'activities', 'gave', 'comfort', 'enemy', 'lengthened', 'war', 'cost', 'American', 'battlefield', 'opinion', 'Kerry', 'not', 'improved', 'attempts', 'suppress', 'film', 'so', 'similar', 'goon', 'squad', 'tactics', 'used', 'Nader', 'people', 'past', 'presidential', 'election', 'Anyone', 'who', 'saw', 'Lawrence', 'Tribe', 'argue', 'DNC', 'front', 'Florida', 'Supreme', 'Court', 'C-SPAN', '9/17/04', 'keep', 'Ralph', 'Nader', 'ballot', 'will', 'know', 'what', 'mean.The', 'heart', 'soul', 'documentary', 'are', 'seventeen', 'steadfast', 'heroic', 'men', 'who', 'are', 'interviewed', 'stories', 'are', 'gripping', 'wounds', 'deep', 'opened', 'again', 'man', 'who', 'dared', 'make', 'Vietnam', 'cornerstone', 'candidacy', 'highest', 'office', 'land', 'when', 'saluted', 'millions', 'viewers', 'reported', 'duty', 'Having', 'done', 'so', 'stories', 'memories', 'who', 'tell', 'will', 'follow', 'Kerry', 'rest', 'public', 'life', 'ready', 'surface', 'again', 'doubt', '2006', 're-election', 'Senate.As', 'George', 'Bud', 'Day', 'who', 'was', 'imprisoned', 'tortured', 'five', 'years', 'seven', 'months', 'man', 'committed', 'act', 'treason', 'lied', 'besmirched', 'name', 'did', 'self-interest', 'now', 'forget', 'can', 'never', 'forget', '.Produced', 'presented', 'Carlton', 'Sherwood', 'total', 'running', 'time', '42', 'minutes']",N/A

Mitchell ""Jet Jock""","[91, 107]","WOW, one person calls people whiners and the other calls the President AWOL and other names.Use your computer to see that Kerry applied to study in Paris and his petition was denied so he joined the Navy figuring to stay out of the war. 4 MONTHS in country---first month in training---3 months on a boat where ONE of his crew refuses to stand with him and well over 100 other Swifties depise him but you don't want to hear from THEM, now do you? I mean John O'Neil was only in Nam for 18 months and has fought Kerry's lies for the past 30 some years. But why listen to a REAL hero?Also, Bush requested Nam. Turned down. Who knows? Maybe daddy who was head of the CIA at the time had other work for him OR just kept him safe. CLINTON was commander in chief and TOTALLY dodged the entire war.Oh, by the way, what do you think the difference is between learning to pilot a swift boat and learning to fly an F-102? Bush earned the right to wear that flight suit.Kerry, on the other hand, wore full dress whites to meet with the enemy while we were at war, and bad mouth our men to them just as he did to our whole country.

855021,A2BTYX4QNN3S20,B0004GI250,JR Dunn,"[20, 24]","What Goes Around..., November 14, 2004Reviewer: JR Dunn (New Brunswick,, NJ USA) - See all my reviews(REAL NAME)So this is the film that so frightened the Democrats that they jettisoned all their closely-held principles to shut it down.You can see their point. On the surface, ""Stolen Honor"" is little more than an hour's worth of aging men telling war stories. But what stories! And what men -- each of them a survivor of years in the Hanoi Hilton, a human-created hell representing far worse than most of the people reading this will ever have to endure.Take Leo Thorsness. As a pilot of a Wild Weasel fighter, Thorsness took on a squadron of MiGs and several SAM sites preparing to ambush an approaching bomber formation. He did it alone, and -- in the last pass that set the MiGs running for home -- without any ammunition. And he got up the next day and flew back into battle, and the day after that, until he was shot down at last. He didn't lay eyes on his Medal of Honor until after he was freed.Thorsness is merely representative of who these men are and what they accomplished. Compare them to their accuser. Give him everything he claims -- his three Purple Hearts that he ""bled"" for, the Silver Star for shooting a teenager in the back. Then compare it to the records of the men featured in this film. It doesn't match up, does it?Yet these are the men the junior senator from Massachusetts slandered. These are the men he silenced. Keep that in mind when he next attempts to call attention to himself.One final point -- in the very last interview (I forget the name, and it really makes no difference), pay close attention to the woman sitting beside the man being interviewed. She's old, and gray, and could be anyone's grandmother. But watch the play of emotions across her face as her husband speaks. You will learn quite a lot of value about love, and fortitude, and will, and what it takes to be human in a world that often seems hostile beyond measure.",5,What Goes Around...,1100304000,"11 13, 2004",2004,1971,"['What', 'Around', 'November', '14', '2004Reviewer', 'JR', 'Dunn', 'New', 'Brunswick', 'NJ', 'USA', 'See', 'reviews', 'REAL', 'NAME', 'film', 'so', 'frightened', 'Democrats', 'jettisoned', 'closely-held', 'principles', 'shut', 'down.You', 'can', 'see', 'point', 'surface', 'Stolen', 'Honor', 'little', 'more', 'hour', 'worth', 'aging', 'men', 'telling', 'war', 'stories', 'what', 'what', 'men', 'survivor', 'years', 'Hanoi', 'Hilton', 'human-created', 'hell', 'representing', 'far', 'worse', 'most', 'people', 'reading', 'will', 'ever', 'have', 'endure.Take', 'Leo', 'Thorsness', 'pilot', 'Wild', 'Weasel', 'fighter', 'Thorsness', 'took', 'squadron', 'MiGs', 'several', 'SAM', 'sites', 'preparing', 'ambush', 'approaching', 'bomber', 'formation', 'did', 'alone', 'last', 'pass', 'set', 'MiGs', 'running', 'home', 'ammunition', 'got', 'up', 'next', 'day', 'flew', 'back', 'battle', 'day', 'was', 'shot', 'down', 'last', 'did', ""n't"", 'lay', 'eyes', 'Medal', 'Honor', 'was', 'freed.Thorsness', 'merely', 'representative', 'who', 'men', 'are', 'what', 'accomplished', 'Compare', 'accuser', 'Give', 'everything', 'three', 'Purple', 'Hearts', 'bled', 'Silver', 'Star', 'shooting', 'teenager', 'back', 'Then', 'compare', 'records', 'men', 'featured', 'film', ""n't"", 'match', 'up', 'are', 'men', 'junior', 'senator', 'Massachusetts', 'slandered', 'are', 'men', 'silenced', 'Keep', 'mind', 'when', 'next', 'call', 'attention', 'himself.One', 'final', 'point', 'very', 'last', 'interview', 'forget', 'name', 'really', 'difference', 'pay', 'close', 'attention', 'woman', 'sitting', 'man', 'being', 'interviewed', 'old', 'gray', 'could', 'be', 'anyone', 'grandmother', 'watch', 'play', 'emotions', 'face', 'husband', 'speaks', 'will', 'learn', 'quite', 'lot', 'value', 'love', 'fortitude', 'will', 'what', 'be', 'human', 'world', 'often', 'hostile', 'measure']",N/A

But this film merely gives the stories of several Vietnam POW's and what they think of what John Kerry did in denoucing the war and how they were affected.  These men talk about their experiences in POW camps - most for 4 - 7 years - and how they felt about what John Kerry did when he returned from Vietnam to the U.S. and his anti-war activities.
