They always give express service it's just great - their biggest compliment because I've never been let down with that . But most of the sets were scratched :( I have to pack them away and I'm hoping that they will play when I unpack them and set everything up again . I grew up with this series I k ow it backwards a forwards and know I will be satisfied with that . I had these already and I sold them and wanted the same sets back so I opted for them separately instead of the complete set as I wantedtbe one I used to have and missed :) so keep your fingers crossed . One of the sweetest reps for amazon Johnnie gave me confidence that even though scratch they would most likely still play . They are really scratched y the way I mean visibly - but she was such a sweet spirit that I decided to just go with what she said . I like mine desperate and these are the exact ones I had before !!

I was however really upset with the disc with Teen Angels on it. Several scenes were jumped ahead because of something in the disc yet I find no marking on the disc and have watched all the other episodes on it and no problems with it as well as made sure my player had been cleaned. So many scenes in that episode of Teen Angels were jumped ahead and I never got to see what actually happened and how it happened!

On ""Angel on my Mind"" when Kris almost got hit by the taxi, the taxi driver acted like it was her fault, but he was running a stop sign. If he was going to stop the way he was supposed to by law he would have stopped before he even came close to hitting Kris. On ""Angels in Vegas"" Kelly told Haines that Mary Phillips was a girlfriend of hers, but when Slokum told him Kelly was talking to Mary Phillips roommate he seemed surprised Kelly knew Mary Phillips, even though it was a few minutes after Kelly told him she did. Also when Jip got hit by the black truck he was walking his cat in the driveway. My problem with this one is that when he saw the truck he didn't move out of the way. He just kept walking in front of the truck, as if he was waiting to be run over. Any sane person would have moved out of the way. There are a lot of other examples of this in the series.

988531,ARMWTU2IDP4H5,B000FDFSH2,Chris Ohsiek,"[13, 17]","Well it's about time!  Angel fans have been waiting 2 yrs since the release of Season 2!  This was the longest of the five seasons & the only time the Angel lineup didnt change.  This is Kate Jackson's final season & the last we'll see of her in the series, which is funny because in the season finale she makes a toast saying, ""here's to many more (adventures)!""  This also is the first three of six contracted obligations for Farrah Fawcett to make guest appearances, almost leaving no room for Cheryl Ladd in one particular episode (""Mother Angel"").  In fact David Doyle is almost forgotten as well. In this episode there's one too many angels, but the other two featuring Farrah, ""Angel Comes Home"" & ""Angel in a Box"" works out well for four angels.  I can hardly wait!! I wouldnt be suprised every copy gets sold out & out of stock on July 3rd! The last time I saw season 3 was on TV Land & they edit each episode.  Also they left out one episode, ""Angels on Vacation"" which I haven't seen since it reran in the summer of '79.  Hopefully seasons 4 & 5 will each be released shortly afterward.

Freakin' Freestyle,"[3, 6]","Role call: Sabrina Duncan, Jill Munroe, Kelly Garret, Kris Munroe, Tiffany Wells, Julie Rodgers, John Bosley and Woodville(pilot only)- hey, I liked 'em all, even Julie and Tiff.Please hurry and release season 4 already, as I particularly liked ""Caged Angel"" where Kris goes to prison and infiltrates a criminal gang on the inside(who can forget Big Aggie- Agnes Kemp played by Shirley Stoler), and when the angels are stranded on the game reserve island and hunted down one by one by LLoyd Bochner. Those are the two stand out episodes of season 4. Oh my, I'm jumping ahead of myself when were supposed to be talking about Season 3.  For all you completists, I recommend you buying this volume because it's Sabrina's swan song-""Angels Remembered"". The stand out villan of this season is Zora from ""Angels In Springtime"". Dr. Slavin, the hypnotherapist that attempted to give Kelly a hypodermic filled with sodium penthethol and Zora had a little more than just a ""freindship"" going on. As well as Mercedes McCambridge's character and the murdered actress Eve Le Duex. It seemed like every season had some strong armed, lesbian type-that's what made ""Angels"" so entertaining. The first season had prison corrections officer Maxine""Max"" of Pine Parish farm prison for women and Inga, Moonshadow's masuess(mispelled). The second season had the russian Olga on her ice skates totting a real mean machine gun. The storyline was always so predictable. In the end, the angels were going to defeat the big, bad and the ugly surely. Sometimes, I would have prefered the angels to losing to the criminal or not exactly solving everything about a case just to make it more realistic. The only problem I had with the ending of the series is that of the repeated storyline with Kelly being shot again. Come on producers and writers, you guys could've done something fresh and original. Also maybe made ammends with Kate Jackson since she was an original angel, and invited her back along with Farrah. Hell, you also could of given Shelly Hack a cameo since it was referenced that she had to go back East for awhile at the beginning of the 5th seaon. So that was kind of a cop out of a way of writing a character out of a series. So the producers wanted to stick with the Kelly being shot idea-it would've been a treat for all of the fans for the five angels(past and present) and Bosley  toothat everyone be incorporated in the last episode.

I'm going to try to keep this review to the point and do my best to give you my honest opinion about what I noticed during the time I was watching Season three.For me, Season three really had its ups and downs.  When an episode was good, it was typically very good.  When one was bad, I often wondered why they even took the time to shoot it.  Long time Angel writer Edward J. Lakso wrote ten of the Season three episodes and it was quite obvious that he was getting a bit burned out. (Although, he did continue writing for the show in seasons four and five.)About half way through the set, you can tell that Kate Jackson is losing interest in Charlie's Angels.  When working with a good script, Kate is at her absolute best.  When working with a bad one, you can tell that she is not happy.  I think I once read that Kate was totally outraged by the script for ""Marathon Angels"" and I don't blame her.  The entire episode was basically an excuse for filming young women with large breasts (and no bras) running a foot-race.While Season three does contain a few pit-falls, many of the episodes are the best that ever came out of the entire series!P.S.

Two years, two months and 27 days! Now I hope we don't have to wait for a decade to see all 5 seasons available on DVD.The third season of Charlie's Angels was a good one. Not as good as the second, which, in my opinion, was the high point of the show, but the best trio of Angels (Cheryl, Jaclyn and Kate)were still together (unfortunately for the last time) and, in 3 occasions, a fourth Angel, Farrah, was present too.That was great...4 pretty Angels all in a row! The scripts for the third season were still inventive and effective, although there were some (just a few) dull moments. Some great episodes like ""Angels Come Home"", ""Rosemary for Remembrance"", ""Angels in Vegas"", ""Angels in Springtime"", ""Mother Angel"", ""Angels on Vacation"", ""Angel on My Mind"" and others certainly make the third season of Charlie's Angels very attractive and worth of seeing all 22 episodes.The cover art is also very nice. The small picture of Farrah was an excellent idea, and Jaclyn, Cheryl and Kate are very natural, very beautiful. They are not much retouched as they were for cover art of season two. They are much better now.But why no special features?

It would have been nice to have some extras, but it won't influence my decision to buy or not to buy.

Spelling-Goldberg agreed to drop their lawsuit in exchange for Farrah appearing in 3 episodes in Season 3 and Season 4.  I look forward to Season 4, as some really great episodes came from that season as well, such as ""Avenging Angel"", ""Fallen Angel"" (the best of Farrah's 6 return episodes), ""Of Ghosts and Angels.""  Contrary to many's opinion, Shelley Hack was no where near as dreadful as she was made out to be, and after having filmed several episodes, she was coming along.

988551,A2UUYORVIZ00UH,B000FDFSH2,Noirdame,"[2, 3]","Season Three of ""Charlie's Angels"" , which ran from 1978 to 1979, fell a little in my opinion from the previous two, perhaps in view of the fact that Kate Jackson wanted out of the show and Farrah Fawcett's guest appearances were somewhat lackluster. As great as it was to see the Angels together again, it was clear that Farrah did not want to be there.  Having said that, however, there are some great episodes in this season - my favorites being the two-parter ""Angels In Vegas"" (featuring guest stars Dean Martin, and in his first appearance on CA, Vic Morrow), the classic ""Angels In Springtime"", ""Haunted Angels"", ""Angel On My Mind"", ""Angels On Vacation"", ""Counterfeit Angels"", ""Angel In A Box"" and ""Teen Angels"".  While most episodes have pros and cons, and despite some good acting and guest stars, some just were duds, like ""Pom Pom Angels"", ""Marathon Angels"", ""Angels Belong In Heaven"" and ""Terror On Skis"". One previous reviewer mentioned that the writing became lazy and uninspired, perhaps due to the show's huge success going to the heads of some. But I love ""Charlie's Angels"" and I would gladly watch it over most of what passes as ""entertainment"" on television today. My favorite Angels, Jaclyn Smith and Cheryl Ladd are always a delight to watch. Having the series on DVD is a great tribute to the late Aaron Spelling, David Doyle, Farrah Fawcett and John Forsythe.

988554,A3BZSYJKZCRY03,B000FDFSH2,Retro Pixie,"[0, 0]","The heavenly angels are at it again for a third season of crime fighting, campy fun and more lip gloss than the law allows.  They kept the lip gloss manufacturers quite profitable, I'm sure.  Even today, before I go out...I ask myself if I have on enough lip gloss to be Angel worthy.  Many times I've uttered the words, ""What would Kelly Garrett do?""In this third season, 1978/79, Kris (Cheryl Ladd), Kelly (Jaclyn Smith) and Sabrina (Kate Jackson) join forces to fight everything from psychics to someone who clearly despises cheerleaders.The angels have it all:Sabrina - brainy, strong and the shiniest hair in historyKelly - beautiful, elegant on the outside, tough on the inside and to-die-for Breck Girl hairKris - sassy, sexy, funny and so ethereally pretty at times that she looks like an actual angelThis is a great season.  You'll find something for everyone:-For the drama lovers:  One of my favorite episodes is ""Angel On My Mind"" featuring a terrific performance by Cheryl Ladd when Kris gets amnesia.-For the lovers of lighthearted camp:  Three of my favorites are:""Disco Angels"" - an episode that must be watched over and over again for some of the hilarious dancing at Freddie's Disco""Pom Pom Angels"" - Someone is kidnapping cheerleaders and cutting their hair.  Sabrina becomes head cheerleading choreographer (is there anything these angels can't do?) Kelly and Kris head out to the football field to shake their pom poms and investigate.  Never will you see Kris fight so hard as when someone tries to cut her hair!""Angels In Springtime"" - Someone is killed at an exclusive spa.  The angels go to the spa in disguise as a head cook (Sabrina), an exercise instructor (Kris) and a guest (Kelly).  They wear lots and lots of pink...and solve a murder!  It's good to be an angel.-For the retro lovers:  ""Rosemary, For Remembrance""- Kris is called to watch over a man who had a gangster past in the 1930's.  Kris looks exactly like his wife who was murdered - a cold case that has been re-opened.  This episode is a standout for a number of reasons.  It's an excellent script without any camp.  The acting is really good, too, particularly Cheryl Ladd.  They spent a lot of money on this one with the beautiful sets and gorgeous clothes.  It focuses more on one angel, which some are not fond of.  I, too, love to see all of the angels and their camaraderie; but there is no denying what a top-notch episode this is.-For the Jill lovers:  Farrah Fawcett appears in three episodes.  My favorite of those is ""Angel Come Home,"" where we see what she's been doing since she left...racing cars.  How does she fit those luscious locks in that helmet?-For those who can't have too many angels:  ""Counterfeit Angels"" finds Sabrina, Kelly and Kris being impersonated by three criminal angels.Other standout moments of the season:-Sabrina gets to kiss Dean Martin-The petite Kris wrestles an alligator-Some crooks try to drown Kelly with pool net skimmers in a cruise ship swimming pool.  The best part is all she has to do is swim to the other side, but she just keeps hanging by the very poles that are trying to push her under.  It's laugh-out-loud funny.Guest stars this season include:  Dean Martin, Scatman Crothers, Robert Urich, Audrey Landers, Jamie Lee Curtis, Rossanno Brazzi, Anne Francis, Dennis Cole (Jaclyn's husband at the time) and more.There are 24 episodes of good quality and color.  One of those is a retrospective with the angels looking back on their adventures of the past few years.  There are no extras.It's a heavenly season; I highly recommend it!  I have to go now; the golden-voiced Charlie will be calling soon ,and I need to put on some lip gloss!

Yes, I am happy that the 24 episode third season of this `classic' (in every sense of the word) series has FINALLY been released. However, there is so much irony that he is unable to see how much enjoyment it will continue bringing to people.There are a couple of episodes which don't work, but overall the production team remembered their winning formula and stuck with it as opposed to `experimenting'. They wanted to keep this show on the air and being watched by the largest market share of viewers possible. In an era when there actually were only three networks, viewer competition was still very fierce.  The 1978-1979 season of the ABC blockbuster is dominated by the recurring themes of lavish sets and special guest stars.Since it's still the 1970's,the obligatory `disco-theme' episode is also included. During ""Disco Angels"", the Angels investigate a killer who seems to be operating near a disco. This episode works well because it turns the then-cultural assumption of the disco as a `happy' and `carefree' place squarely on the head. Bad things unfortunately happen here too--necessitating the Angels's intervention. Naturally, they save the day though!Perpetually best known for the `second Darrin' role in the 1960's `Bewitched', Dick Sargent guest stars as `Marty Cole', a lounge singer with secrets in the two-part season opener. Then, Jamie Lee Curtis plays `Linda', a young woman attempting to win a golf tournament in the era when women's professional sports associations themselves still were starting up, Casey Kasem guests as Tom Rogers' in the same episode . Before playing `Commander William Riker' on `Star Trek: The Next Generation', Jonathan Frakes was `Brad' in this series. Other famous names include Scatman Crothers. These people and their agents understood that the way to be seen in the late 1970's was to put in a guest appearance on this or another very popular show.Of course, the most infamous guest star is Farrah Fawcett--obligated to return to the same series she had earlier left for `better opportunities'--as a `special guest star'. Because her absence was explained in prior episodes by having quit detective work to go off and race cars, Jill Munroe makes her first reappearance in ""Angel Come Home"" in the context of investigating why an old flame's experimental car which she had been asked to drive blew up. Ironically enough, Stephen Collins (who would later play `Eric Camden' in `7th Heaven') also makes his own guest appearance during this exact same episode.She reappears in ""Mother Angel"" and ""Angels in a Box"", but oddly does not in ""Angels on Vacation"" when you consider that Kris's relatives are also HER relatives. Why would Jill Munroe only bail former coworkers out of tough situations but not both co-workers and family?Charlie's Angels still gets portrayed as light-hearted camp, but ""Angels belong in Heaven"" raised an important question when a small-time-crook who was friendly with Charlie hires the Angels for a job. Being trained police officers (who are ideally not supposed to work with criminals of any kind) their most recent case creates an interesting situation for the Angels.  How much do any of the Angels--current or former-- really know about their boss's business dealings or even the boss himself? It's campy in the sense that they don't start an examination and/or carry these ethical considerations over into subsequent episodes, but at least the issue was briefly raised instead of steadfastly maintaining the simplistic good/bad binary where the Townsend Agency and employees are always `perfect' and the people that they catch are the ones with flaws (ala `Batman').Perhaps in a timely coincidence, lots of other references to then-current and then-future Spelling productions are tucked away in this same season. ""Angels Ahoy"" obviously invokes the then-simultaneous successes of the `Love Boat'; by having the Angels on a cruise ship for an investigation. ""Teen Angel"" appears to have `tested the waters' for the subsequently very successful `high school' years of `Beverly Hills 90210'; students at a school are so rich that they are easily affording to purchase and use drugs.There were no extras included on this DVD release, but I genuinely expect something included on the next--and the DVD sets themselves being promptly released to meet enduring public demand. The prolonged gap for this series honestly is unacceptable.

988557,AAP2RANG3TTSM,B000FDFSH2,"Rodney Bogardus ""piscean dream""","[70, 75]","The third season of Charlie's Angels, which aired on Wednesdays at 9 p.m. on ABC from September 1978 through May 1979, had a lot going for it, as well as a lot to live up to.  The first season exploded onto television and immediately became a Nielsen ratings champ. Thanks to tweaked writing and a better timeslot, the second season was an even greater success, despite losing the angel who became a cultural phenomenon, Farrah Fawcett's ""Jill Munroe.""One unique aspect of the third season is that it has the distinction of being the first (and only) season to have all three angels returning from the previous one-Cheryl Ladd as ""Kris Munroe"" who replaced Farrah, in addition to original angels ""Sabrina Duncan"" and ""Kelley Garret,"" played by Kate Jackson and Jaclyn Smith respectively. Additionally, Farrah's contractual return for three episodes this season was another asset for the returning show. Her Townsend Associates homecoming alone caused enough media hype to potentially catapult the ratings even higher than before as everyone was curious to see how the former angel would come back into the fold with her younger sister and former colleagues. Not to mention that this season was filled with plenty of guest appearances including Dean Martin, Dick Sargent, Nancy Parsons, Anne Francis, Casey Kasem, and an up-and-coming young actress by the name of Jamie Lee Curtis. So with all of these factors going for it, this season should have been nothing less than stellar.Well, that wasn't quite the case. I think that the actresses, along with faithful sidekick ""Bosley,"" played perfectly by the late David Doyle, performed to the best of their abilities, given the material. The real problem is that by the time the third season began, the producers/creators thought that the show was infallible given its immense popularity and record-setting ratings, and this arrogance on their behalf lead to a creative decline mostly due to inferior writing. One particular writer became quite lazy with his scripts, and a pattern begins to emerge in his scripted episodes: they lack any real depth and tend to be built around one good central idea that isn't fleshed out enough for an entire episode. Examples of these episodes include: ANGELS BELONG IN HEAVEN, ANGELS ON VACATION, MARATHON ANGELS, ANGEL ON HIGH, and TERROR ON SKIS, the latter of which he admittedly wrote because his wife wanted to go on a skiing vacation!?! The initial ideas for these episodes are good, but the episodes as a whole don't match the calibur of earlier Angel outings.Since Charlie's Angels is more episodic (meaning that the storylines are limited to the duration of an episode) than serial (where storylines last several episodes or even an entire season), it's better to have a diverse mix of writers and directors so that they can bring their own creativity to the show, thus giving it a fresh, ever-evolving feel. Consequently, the season's highlights are when guest writers contributed scripts: COUNTERFEIT ANGELS is an original episode that uses Charlie's anonymity against him when a man disguises his voice to impersonate Charlie and send his ""evil angels"" out to do his bidding; Jill's return in ANGEL COME HOME has a well-developed story that naturally involves all 4 angels as they work together to discover who sent the phony emergency cablegram that brought Jill back from racing in Europe; and another bright spot in the season, and series, is the classic ANGELS IN SPRINGTIME where the Angels infiltrate a women's spa to solve the murder of a famous actress and find her missing memoirs. This episode is loaded with fun, from short shorts to frigid adversaries to faking hypnotism, and this episode boasts one of the best villains: Zora the hefty physical therapist who uses her might against little Kris during a rough confrontation.As for the DVD set, there's nothing in the form of ""special features,"" but for me the show itself is worth the purchase. The packaging for this season is different than the formats used for previous seasons, with this season's packaging consisting of an outer box that houses 3 slim plastic DVD cases. Each case holds 2 discs and features a large photo of an angel on the cover, episode titles, descriptions and airdates on the back, and several photos of the angels and Bosley on the inside. Of all 3 season DVD releases, I believe this one has the best packaging. The film restoration is excellent, as the episodes look and sound great! My only complaint about the set is that the 2 double-length episodes, ""Angels in Vegas"" and ""Terror on Skis,"" are the syndicated versions that are each split up into 2-part episodes. It would be nice to have the rarely seen, unedited, original versions of these episodes.I love the Angels, through thick and thin, and even though this season has its flaws, I'm thrilled to add it to my Angel DVD collection. It's just a shame that a season that could have been spectacular as a whole was instead lackluster.Season 3: 4 starsSeason 3 DVD set: 4 stars",4,"The Angels are back, but not in the most Angelic of

988561,A3FL6CIO8QIJ2F,B000FDFSH2,"Terrance Richard ""Terry Richard""","[2, 5]","""Charlie's Angels"" began its third season in the fall of 1978 while entrenched as one of ABC's biggest hits. The series continued to flourish, ending the year with a huge 18.2 Nielsen rating, almost as high as its first season. All regular angels are back, as this would mark the only season in which all current angels came back from the previous year with no recasts. Farrah Fawcett, obligated to return for three more shows, returns, and the angles are in top form solving crimes and arresting the bad guys. The third year is also the final good year of ""Charlie's Angels"" before it ""jumped the shark"", meaning the program lost all credibility and suffered from the loss of lead angel Kate Jackson, who quit this season after Aaron Spelling wouldn't give her time off to do the movie ""Kramer vs. Kramer"", as she was supposed to star in the role made famous by Meryl Streep. After wrapping up production on ""Charlie's Angels"" in the early spring of 1979 Kate told the producers she was done. In a press release Kate stated the show had been good to her and her good to it, but it was time to move on, but privately she confided in friends that if she had been able to do ""Kramer"" she would have stayed with the show forever. Losing Kate Jackson killed this show, not only because she was the best actress on it (she had received multiple Emmy nods for her performance of Sabrina), but also because once she left morale was low on the set. The series lasted two more seasons, albeit to poor ratings, and the show never recovered from losing such an important cast member.This season features all 22 episodes, but like the second season two shows are the cut/syndicated episodes called ""Angels in Vegas"" and ""Terror on Skis"".This boxset came out in 2006 which meant the studio has been extremely slow in releasing future boxsets. In the spring of 2009 it was announced by Sony that season four is finally going to be released in the late summer.",5,"""The Last Good Year For Charlie's Angels""",1242000000,"05 11, 2009",2009,1945,"['Charlie', 'Angels', 'began', 'third', 'season', 'fall', '1978', 'while', 'entrenched', 'one', 'ABC', 'biggest', 'hits', 'series', 'continued', 'flourish', 'ending', 'year', 'huge', '18.2', 'Nielsen', 'rating', 'almost', 'as', 'high', 'first', 'season', 'regular', 'angels', 'are', 'back', 'would', 'mark', 'only', 'season', 'current', 'angels', 'came', 'back', 'previous', 'year', 'recasts', 'Farrah', 'Fawcett', 'obligated', 'return', 'three', 'more', 'shows', 'returns', 'angles', 'are', 'top', 'form', 'solving', 'crimes', 'arresting', 'bad', 'guys', 'third', 'year', 'also', 'final', 'good', 'year', 'Charlie', 'Angels', 'jumped', 'shark', 'meaning', 'program', 'lost', 'credibility', 'suffered', 'loss', 'lead', 'angel', 'Kate', 'Jackson', 'who', 'quit', 'season', 'Aaron', 'Spelling', 'would', ""n't"", 'give', 'time', 'do', 'movie', 'Kramer', 'vs.', 'Kramer', 'was', 'supposed', 'star', 'role', 'made', 'famous', 'Meryl', 'Streep', 'wrapping', 'up', 'production', 'Charlie', 'Angels', 'early', 'spring', '1979', 'Kate', 'told', 'producers', 'was', 'done', 'press', 'release', 'Kate', 'stated', 'show', 'had', 'been', 'good', 'good', 'was', 'time', 'move', 'privately', 'confided', 'friends', 'had', 'been', 'able', 'do', 'Kramer', 'would', 'have', 'stayed', 'show', 'forever', 'Losing', 'Kate', 'Jackson', 'killed', 'show', 'not', 'only', 'was', 'best', 'actress', 'had', 'received', 'multiple', 'Emmy', 'nods', 'performance', 'Sabrina', 'also', 'once', 'left', 'morale', 'was', 'low', 'set', 'series', 'lasted', 'two', 'more', 'seasons', 'poor', 'ratings', 'show', 'never', 'recovered', 'losing', 'important', 'cast', 'member.This', 'season', '22', 'episodes', 'second', 'season', 'two', 'shows', 'are', 'cut/syndicated', 'episodes', 'called', 'Angels', 'Vegas', 'Terror', 'Skis', '.This', 'boxset', 'came', 'out', '2006', 'meant', 'studio', 'been', 'extremely', 'slow', 'releasing', 'future', 'boxsets', 'spring', '2009', 'was', 'announced', 'Sony', 'season', 'four', 'finally', 'going', 'be', 'released', 'late', 'summer']",N/A

988564,A1RRPBF14VTAUE,B000FDFSH2,Tucker,"[22, 28]","Well season three is finally here. Unfortunately, I only give it a three star rating because the DVD set does not contain any extras and both ""Angels in Vegas"" and ""Terror on Skis"" are presented in their syndicated format (like last season's ""Angels in Paradise"" and Angels on Ice"") which means they've been edited. The packaging is fine (I prefer the book format from season two). The six discs are enclosed in three individual jackets (although not as cheap as the season one jackets) and the photos of the Angels inside each jacket is a nice touch. I do think Farrah Fawcett gets a little too much exposure on the packaging. She's only in three episodes but judging from the artwork, you'd think she was a series regular again. The group photo on the back would have been sufficient. I'm surprised they didn't try to squeeze her photo onto the jacket covers with the others.Season three is not a bad season as a whole. It has some great episodes (Angels in Vegas, Terror on Skis, Counterfeit Angels) but it also contains the worst episode in the series thus far and a sign of things to come. ""Rosemary for Remembrance"" is the first of the ""solo outings"" format which was used quite often in season four. Now I'm sure Cheryl Ladd fans will disagree with me but this episode simply doesn't work. The series always worked best when all three Angels had fairly equal air time and worked together. It's the one episode I probably will never watch on this collection.The release of season three pretty much brings the series to an end for me since I basically watched it for Kate Jackson and tuned out after she left the show. I hope, however, that for the sake of the fans who watched up until the end, that Sony will be a little more expeditious with seasons four and five.",3,Finally!,1152144000,"07 6, 2006",2006,1772,"['Well', 'season', 'three', 'finally', 'here', 'Unfortunately', 'only', 'give', 'three', 'star', 'rating', 'DVD', 'set', 'not', 'contain', 'extras', 'Angels', 'Vegas', 'Terror', 'Skis', 'are', 'presented', 'syndicated', 'format', 'last', 'season', 'Angels', 'Paradise', 'Angels', 'Ice', ""'ve"", 'been', 'edited', 'packaging', 'fine', 'prefer', 'book', 'format', 'season', 'two', 'six', 'discs', 'are', 'enclosed', 'three', 'individual', 'jackets', 'not', 'as', 'cheap', 'season', 'one', 'jackets', 'photos', 'Angels', 'jacket', 'nice', 'touch', 'do', 'think', 'Farrah', 'Fawcett', 'little', 'too', 'much', 'exposure', 'packaging', 'only', 'three', 'episodes', 'judging', 'artwork', ""'d"", 'think', 'was', 'series', 'regular', 'again', 'group', 'photo', 'back', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'sufficient', ""'m"", 'surprised', 'did', ""n't"", 'try', 'squeeze', 'photo', 'jacket', 'others.Season', 'three', 'not', 'bad', 'season', 'whole', 'great', 'episodes', 'Angels', 'Vegas', 'Terror', 'Skis', 'Counterfeit', 'Angels', 'also', 'worst', 'episode', 'series', 'thus', 'far', 'sign', 'things', 'come', 'Rosemary', 'Remembrance', 'first', 'solo', 'outings', 'format', 'was', 'used', 'quite', 'often', 'season', 'four', 'Now', ""'m"", 'sure', 'Cheryl', 'Ladd', 'fans', 'will', 'disagree', 'episode', 'simply', ""n't"", 'work', 'series', 'always', 'worked', 'best', 'when', 'three', 'Angels', 'had', 'fairly', 'equal', 'air', 'time', 'worked', 'together', 'one', 'episode', 'probably', 'will', 'never', 'watch', 'collection.The', 'release', 'season', 'three', 'pretty', 'much', 'series', 'end', 'basically', 'watched', 'Kate', 'Jackson', 'tuned', 'out', 'left', 'show', 'hope', 'however', 'sake', 'fans', 'who', 'watched', 'up', 'end', 'Sony', 'will', 'be', 'little', 'more', 'expeditious', 'seasons', 'four', 'five']",N/A

It was a great season for the series and the chemistry between Jaclyn Smith, Cheryl Ladd and Kate Jackson was dynamic.  Season 3 also brought with it some great guest stars besides Farrah from Dean Martin in the season premiere to Jamie Lee Curtis, and Stephen Collins.  There were also many infamous 'Angel moments' of season three such as Cheryl Ladd wrestling an aligator to 'Marathon Angels' in which the term 'jiggle tv' was at it's highest with all the marathon runners running with out their bras.The girls were all great in yet another season, the gorgeous Jaclyn Smith dazzled as always as Kelly, Cheryl Ladd went from being the new girl to being part of the team, Kate Jackson was great during her final season on the series and David Doyle was always reliable for bringing the comic charm.Critics who panned the series obviously never got the joke of what the series is all about.  It was never meant to be a heavy hitting crime drama series, it was a bit of fantasy, it was a show that was meant to be light and fun and provide a form of escapism from the real world.  It gave little girls ideas that they can do what men do and it gave guys an hour of nothing but beautiful women running around and catching the bad guys.  It was a series that broke boundaries and would go on in history as one of the most popular series of all time.
