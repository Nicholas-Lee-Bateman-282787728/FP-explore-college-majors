The first half of the movie carried on entirely too long focusing on nothing but teenagers having fun and partying with friends.  That's all fine and good in real life, but as part of a storyline in a movie it just doesn't work.  Even if you're a teenanger, I'd find it hard to believe you'd be able to find something interesting going on here.With that said, the plot surprised me by drastically changing direction by the second half, and became more serious with a focus on drama.  This is what the movie should have done much, much sooner.  Talking about the difficulty of drugs and friends deciding if they really want to hang out together in the long run were important topics brought up in the second half, and this is the part of the movie that really made up for the boring extensive first half.

Scenes are cut short before they get a chance to even develop. Second, whoever wrote the script seem like they never graduated from junior high school. The characters all have one line dialogues with each other. Where is the creativity in that? What little the characters say, you can just about predict what the sentence (if any) may be. I totally disagree with anyone who gives this movie a rating above 1 star.The only reason I didn't give this movie a fat zero is because I could bop my head to the music.

First of all, dispel any preconceived notions that you might have about ATL the movie if you haven't seen it. Although some may consider T.I. a ""gangster rapper,"" the movie ATL is a coming of age story that young adults and older adults will be able to relate to.T.I. stars in the film as Rashad. Rashad is finishing his senior year of high school. He lives with his uncle and his younger brother Antwone, who they call Ant. Their parents died in an automobile accident years prior. On the weekend, all the kids hand out at Cascade, a local roller skating rink where bragging rights mean everything. Rashad soon meets a young woman named New New. She appears to be a regular girl from the neighborhood but everything with New New isn't what it seems. Ant is feeling the pressure of not having the bling bling. Working part time as a janitor with his brother and his uncle just isn't enough money for him. Soon Ant turns to the streets to make easy cash.Rashad does his best to rescue his brother from a life as a street hustler while trying to balance a new relationship with New New. Rashad's friend Esquire also has a significant storyline in the movie. Esquire doesn't attend the same high school as the rest of the crew, he attends a school in a nice neighborhood and has dreams of attending an Ivy League college--if he can get the letter of reference that he needs.ATL is a really great movie. The soundtrack is very good also. The film is also packed with cameos from Atlanta hip-hop stars.

""A New Yorker""","[7, 8]","`ATL' is a coming of age story set in Atlanta, Georgia and follows five friends as they compete in the local skating rink and go through their trials and tribulations. Many people are dogging this movie and labeling it ""another rap movie"" but it's really good. It's a heartfelt and genuine film and separates itself from the rest with the humor and message. It doesn't glorify violence or drug dealing, though it is in the film, but denounces it and calls for teens to make right decisions in their lives.I was impressed with the acting of T.I. as his portrayal of Rashaad. T.I. was convincing and was the perfect choice for the role. His character ranged various emotions between his love interest, family and friends but at times you would catch him with his signature expression (tilting the head to side with the corner of his lips curl up). Big Boi maintains a great performance providing plenty of comic relief and still stays in his antagonistic character. Every scene which focused on Big Boi's character Marcus was full of suspense and showcased his ability to be hated and respect in the same realm. Can't wait to see what he brings `Idlewild.'Other considerable performances were Albert Daniels as Brooklyn, Evan Ross Naess as Rashaad's confused younger brother ""Ant"", and fresh face newcomer Lauren London as the lovable New-New show's us that she has heart. Jason Weaver comedic performance steals the scene as the underachiever Teddy. The breakthrough performance could be that of Jackie Long as the great hope of the group Esquire. The movie was very entertaining over all but suffered from a few clich&eacute;s and minor missteps which was the flow of the movie. Chris Robinson is a great director and Antwone Fisher is a great writer. But I felt that the movie was choppy at times with the story telling. As the film gained momentum it slowed abruptly, other than that, the film transitioned smoothly. The clich&eacute;s of the movie was the Atlanta cameos. I just felt at times it took away from the movie. If you don't realize the cameos, it will be a great movie, if you do notice them it will feel less like a compelling story and more like a 2 hour shout out to ATL.Other than that it's a good movie that you can feel and form an attachment to Rashaad's plight in the movie. I truly love the direction that our rappers are taking by getting into Hollywood. People like Ludicrous are getting a lot of attention for their acting and if that continues hopefully we can see more of them on the silver screen.

I agree with people in saying that this movie was strongly advertised with bad previews. The previews lead you to believe that for one the movie is about drug dealing then you start to think the movie is totally about T.I.'s little brother Anton played by Evan Ross and his money problems with Big Boi. This movie is a classic because it tells a story of the lives of a set of teens in their neighborhood and it's unlike the others that have come out. Instead of boring the audience with the same old same teen flicks ATL gives a realistic story that people can relate to. Anton does run into Big Boi but the movie is not based on that.The story was done on point; I didn't see any flaws in it especially from the young cast. It was very surprising to see these first timers doing so well even the beautiful Lauren London played her character perfectly. Of coarse there was questions of how T.I. did in his first film and I have to tell you he did the best he could by playing what he felt would be a few regular days in the neighborhood and he wasn't that bad. I like the skating scenes because it gave the movie that extra bit of realism; everybody has a spot everybody goes to on a Saturday night.

Still, I felt that I owed it to my city to watch this movie, and even though it wasn't in any way exceptional I wasn't disappointed.T.I. plays an older brother, Rashad, whose parents die leaving him to do everything in his power to ensure that his younger brother, Ant, gets a better life.  They don't live in the worst part of town, but it's not the best either. Rashad puts his own dreams to become a comic strip writer aside hoping that Ant will make something of himself.  When Ant decides to take another route, selling drugs (for Big Boi from Outkast), Rashad is oblivious until it's brought in his face. Then he has to save his brother from the fate that he'd always hoped would never be a problem.  The subplots involve Rashad's love story, a friend trying to get into an Ivy League school, a daughter breaking away from her parents, and friends close to graduation each trying to find their own niche.I think you'd have to live in the South or have an affinity for all things Southern to appreciate the small gifts in this movie like the Fox Theatre, Centennial Olympic Park, Waffle House, MARTA, and the crazy look you give waitresses who ask if you want your tea sweet or unsweet. Overall, this movie means well and it's not nearly as bad as some of the other true tales from a city I've seen.

995215,A1CDZNPO7U4E6N,B000FS9UL2,LadyLestat,"[5, 8]","First of all, let me just say that I am in L.O.V.E with T.I so this review is coming from a biased point of view. I have loved T.I since I heard his first album ""I'm Serious"", and being from the Dirty South, I could relate to a lot of what was going on in this movie. Now, I can agree with the person who said that it does have a lot of ""Roll Bounce"" elements. However, like I said, I would've probably still loved it if it were a musical just because T.I has the lead. Frankly, with this being his first movie, I think he did pretty good. Of course, he'll have to grow and mature as an actor because we've already seen what T.I the rapper can do, but he certainly has potential that's for sure, or like we say in the South... ""FA SHO!"". I do think that all the females in this movie were terrible actresses though, and that includes everyone from Lauren London, on down to the 2 twin girls. To be honest, I won't pretend like it's the best movie ever, but when you like T.I as much as I do you won't care. True enough, it's another ""hood"" classic, but being from the ""hood"" or the ""ghetto"" I can appreciate the realness. I get sooo sick of seeing ""Hollywood"" film-makers dumbing down the ""hood"" movies for entertainment value when they know absolutely nothing about it. This movie was acted-out, Produced, and Directed by ATL's own, and by the people who lived it. Producers include; Tionne ""T-Boz"" Watkins and Dallas Austin, and it's also Directed by Chris Robinson. I thought it was cool that they had a lot of cameo appearances by different artists in the movie. Like, Monica played the waitress at the cafe', and Jazze Pha played the DJ at the rink. In fact, I think that Mykelti Williamson is the biggest actor in this movie. At any rate, it's from the ""hood"", and about the ""hood"", and it's real. It's not all overly dramatized like they tend to depict it in the movies all the time. Like, if you come to the ""hood"" immediately you get robbed or killed, and that's why I liked it because it actually shows that you can hang out at the local skating rink, have fun with your homies, and all the thick ""cornbread and cabbage"" eating chicks. Don't get me wrong, it still shows life in the ""hood"" by showing us how a money hungry youth can get caught up in the wrong lifestyle of selling drugs to get rich quick, and what the consequences of choosing this lifestyle for yourself can potentially be. Anybody from the ""hood"" knows that sh!! is real. It shows that you have wanna-be's coming across the tracks faking the funk when they're really from the suburbs, but they want desperately to be down. Anybody from the ""hood"" knows that sh!! is real too. Obviously, it's not for everyone, so some will love it, and some will hate it, but I loved it because we went about 15 deep, and we all sat there and cracked up off some of the stuff they were saying, and so did everybody else.",4,T.I.....ENOUGH SAID!,1144022400,"04 3, 2006",2006,2882,"['First', 'let', 'just', 'say', 'am', 'L.O.V.E', 'T.I', 'review', 'coming', 'biased', 'point', 'view', 'have', 'loved', 'T.I', 'heard', 'first', 'album', ""'m"", 'Serious', 'being', 'Dirty', 'South', 'could', 'relate', 'lot', 'what', 'was', 'going', 'movie', 'Now', 'can', 'agree', 'person', 'who', 'said', 'have', 'lot', 'Roll', 'Bounce', 'elements', 'However', 'said', 'would', ""'ve"", 'probably', 'still', 'loved', 'were', 'musical', 'just', 'T.I', 'lead', 'Frankly', 'being', 'first', 'movie', 'think', 'did', 'pretty', 'good', 'course', ""'ll"", 'have', 'grow', 'mature', 'actor', ""'ve"", 'already', 'seen', 'what', 'T.I', 'rapper', 'can', 'do', 'certainly', 'potential', 'sure', 'say', 'South', 'FA', 'SHO', 'do', 'think', 'females', 'movie', 'were', 'terrible', 'actresses', 'everyone', 'Lauren', 'London', '2', 'twin', 'girls', 'be', 'honest', 'wo', ""n't"", 'pretend', 'best', 'movie', 'ever', 'when', 'like', 'T.I', 'as', 'much', 'do', 'wo', ""n't"", 'care', 'True', 'enough', 'hood', 'classic', 'being', 'hood', 'ghetto', 'can', 'appreciate', 'realness', 'get', 'sooo', 'sick', 'seeing', 'Hollywood', 'film-makers', 'dumbing', 'down', 'hood', 'movies', 'entertainment', 'value', 'when', 'know', 'absolutely', 'nothing', 'movie', 'was', 'acted-out', 'Produced', 'Directed', 'ATL', 'own', 'people', 'who', 'lived', 'Producers', 'include', 'Tionne', 'T-Boz', 'Watkins', 'Dallas', 'Austin', 'also', 'Directed', 'Chris', 'Robinson', 'thought', 'was', 'cool', 'had', 'lot', 'cameo', 'appearances', 'different', 'artists', 'movie', 'Monica', 'played', 'waitress', 'cafe', 'Jazze', 'Pha', 'played', 'DJ', 'rink', 'fact', 'think', 'Mykelti', 'Williamson', 'biggest', 'actor', 'movie', 'rate', 'hood', 'hood', 'real', 'not', 'overly', 'dramatized', 'tend', 'depict', 'movies', 'time', 'come', 'hood', 'immediately', 'get', 'robbed', 'killed', 'why', 'liked', 'actually', 'can', 'hang', 'out', 'local', 'skating', 'rink', 'have', 'fun', 'homies', 'thick', 'cornbread', 'cabbage', 'eating', 'chicks', 'Do', ""n't"", 'get', 'wrong', 'still', 'life', 'hood', 'showing', 'how', 'money', 'hungry', 'youth', 'can', 'get', 'caught', 'up', 'wrong', 'lifestyle', 'selling', 'drugs', 'get', 'rich', 'quick', 'what', 'consequences', 'choosing', 'lifestyle', 'can', 'potentially', 'be', 'Anybody', 'hood', 'sh', 'real', 'have', 'wanna-be', 'coming', 'tracks', 'faking', 'funk', 'when', ""'re"", 'really', 'suburbs', 'want', 'desperately', 'be', 'down', 'Anybody', 'hood', 'sh', 'real', 'too', 'Obviously', 'not', 'everyone', 'will', 'love', 'will', 'hate', 'loved', 'went', '15', 'deep', 'sat', 'cracked', 'up', 'stuff', 'were', 'saying', 'so', 'did', 'everybody', 'else']",N/A
995216,A2NJO6YE954DBH,B000FS9UL2,Lawrance M. Bernabo,"[5, 6]","In a world where trailers often give away too much and always seem to include the best bits in the movie (and sometimes good bits that are not even in the movie), it was so refreshing to see a movie that was both surprisingly different from what the trailer indicated and a whole better than the trailer.  The trailer for ""ATL,"" which is not an acronym but short for Atlanta, makes it seem like this is a movie where a bunch of male African-American teenagers were going to prove themselves by winning this big team roller skating competition.  So it looks like you have a bit of ""Saturday Night Fever,"" a little of whatever movie with roller skating you like (""Roller Ball"" seems a bit forced, but it was that of ""Xanadu""), and the teenage coming to age film of your choice.  But ""ATL"" is more ambitious in scope and execution, and in the end I was reminded more of ""Boyz in the Hood"" than anything else, and I do not think director Chris Robinson's film suffers all that much by the comparison.The focal character here is Rashad (Tip Harris, a.k.a. T.I.), who is living with his younger brother, Anton (Evan Ross), known as ""Ant,"" with their Uncel George (Mykelti Williamson), because their parents were killed in a car crash.  The other members of the Southside Boys, which is not a gang but a quartet of styling roller scaters, are Esquire (Jackie Long), who is trying to get into an Ivy League school, Brooklyn (Albert Daniels), the transplanted New York who is the group's requisite motor mouth, and Teddy (Jason Weaver), a dropout who works dong custom tooth coverings.  There are three main plot lines in ""ATL,"" that will criss and cross as we go along: Rahsad's romance with New-New (Lauren London), Ant's involvement with the local pusher, Marcus (Antwan Andre Patton, a.k.a. Big Boi), and Esquire's goal of getting successful African-American CEO John Garnett (Keith David) to write him a letter of recommendation for a scholarship that will make his college dream come true.Yes, somebody is going to get shot in this movie, and the impulse to ask why somebody is always getting shot in a movie about African-American teenagers and is tempered by the cold hard facts that although Africa-Americans make up only 12.1% of the American popultion, they accounted for 24.3% of firearm injury deaths.  Firearm homicide is the leading cause of death for African-Americans in the 15-34 age group, so it is significant that these characters are in the early part of this demographic category and that ""ATL"" is, in part, about doing things to immprove their odds.  Not that it really offers specifics, but at least it is about family and friends that stand by each other, even with such ties are pushed to the limit and lines are crossed.The screneplay is by Tina Gordon Chism (""Drumline""), based on the story by Atwone Fisher, who hopefully is moving beyond the autobiographical simply because there are usually limitations on how often you can draw from that well.  Whatever problems I might have with the way the story works out does not extend to his characters, and indeed Rashad and the others do not respond in the expected ways to stereotypical situations, mostly notably when Ant tries to get into the drug trade.  If he is looking for money, power and glamour, he is sorely disappointed, and if Rashad expects Uncle George to come down hard on Ant he is disappointed as well, because the 41-year-old man saddled with two teenage boys would not mind extra money coming into the house.  The end game happens a bit too quickly and way too neatly, but on balance the movie works, and a lot of the weaknesses are forgiven by the powerful soundtrack by Aaron Zigman (""John Q,"" ""Akeelah and the Bee""), and which features T.I.'s song ""Ride With Me.""",4,"""My Pops used to always say dreamin' is the luxury of children, and that I should enjoy it.""",1154304000,"07 31, 2006",2006,3752,"['world', 'where', 'trailers', 'often', 'give', 'away', 'too', 'much', 'always', 'seem', 'include', 'best', 'bits', 'movie', 'sometimes', 'good', 'bits', 'are', 'not', 'even', 'movie', 'was', 'so', 'refreshing', 'see', 'movie', 'was', 'surprisingly', 'different', 'what', 'trailer', 'indicated', 'whole', 'better', 'trailer', 'trailer', 'ATL', 'not', 'acronym', 'short', 'Atlanta', 'seem', 'movie', 'where', 'bunch', 'male', 'African-American', 'teenagers', 'were', 'going', 'prove', 'winning', 'big', 'team', 'roller', 'skating', 'competition', 'have', 'bit', 'Saturday', 'Night', 'Fever', 'little', 'movie', 'roller', 'skating', 'Roller', 'Ball', 'bit', 'forced', 'was', 'Xanadu', 'teenage', 'coming', 'age', 'film', 'choice', 'ATL', 'more', 'ambitious', 'scope', 'execution', 'end', 'was', 'reminded', 'more', 'Boyz', 'Hood', 'anything', 'else', 'do', 'not', 'think', 'director', 'Chris', 'Robinson', 'film', 'suffers', 'that', 'much', 'comparison.The', 'focal', 'character', 'here', 'Rashad', 'Tip', 'Harris', 'a.k.a', 'T.I', 'who', 'living', 'younger', 'brother', 'Anton', 'Evan', 'Ross', 'known', 'Ant', 'Uncel', 'George', 'Mykelti', 'Williamson', 'parents', 'were', 'killed', 'car', 'crash', 'other', 'members', 'Southside', 'Boys', 'not', 'gang', 'quartet', 'styling', 'roller', 'scaters', 'are', 'Esquire', 'Jackie', 'Long', 'who', 'trying', 'get', 'Ivy', 'League', 'school', 'Brooklyn', 'Albert', 'Daniels', 'transplanted', 'New', 'York', 'who', 'group', 'requisite', 'motor', 'mouth', 'Teddy', 'Jason', 'Weaver', 'dropout', 'who', 'dong', 'custom', 'tooth', 'coverings', 'are', 'three', 'main', 'plot', 'lines', 'ATL', 'will', 'criss', 'cross', 'go', 'along', 'Rahsad', 'romance', 'New-New', 'Lauren', 'London', 'Ant', 'involvement', 'local', 'pusher', 'Marcus', 'Antwan', 'Andre', 'Patton', 'a.k.a', 'Big', 'Boi', 'Esquire', 'goal', 'getting', 'successful', 'African-American', 'CEO', 'John', 'Garnett', 'Keith', 'David', 'write', 'letter', 'recommendation', 'scholarship', 'will', 'make', 'college', 'dream', 'come', 'true.Yes', 'somebody', 'going', 'get', 'shot', 'movie', 'impulse', 'ask', 'why', 'somebody', 'always', 'getting', 'shot', 'movie', 'African-American', 'teenagers', 'tempered', 'cold', 'hard', 'facts', 'Africa-Americans', 'make', 'up', 'only', '12.1', '%', 'American', 'popultion', 'accounted', '24.3', '%', 'firearm', 'injury', 'deaths', 'Firearm', 'homicide', 'leading', 'cause', 'death', 'African-Americans', '15-34', 'age', 'group', 'significant', 'characters', 'are', 'early', 'part', 'demographic', 'category', 'ATL', 'part', 'doing', 'things', 'immprove', 'odds', 'Not', 'really', 'specifics', 'least', 'family', 'friends', 'stand', 'other', 'even', 'such', 'ties', 'are', 'pushed', 'limit', 'lines', 'are', 'crossed.The', 'screneplay', 'Tina', 'Gordon', 'Chism', 'Drumline', 'based', 'story', 'Atwone', 'Fisher', 'who', 'hopefully', 'moving', 'autobiographical', 'simply', 'are', 'usually', 'limitations', 'how', 'often', 'can', 'draw', 'well', 'problems', 'might', 'have', 'way', 'story', 'out', 'not', 'extend', 'characters', 'indeed', 'Rashad', 'others', 'do', 'not', 'respond', 'expected', 'ways', 'stereotypical', 'situations', 'mostly', 'notably', 'when', 'Ant', 'get', 'drug', 'trade', 'looking', 'money', 'power', 'glamour', 'sorely', 'disappointed', 'Rashad', 'Uncle', 'George', 'come', 'down', 'hard', 'Ant', 'disappointed', 'as', 'well', '41-year-old', 'man', 'saddled', 'two', 'teenage', 'boys', 'would', 'not', 'mind', 'extra', 'money', 'coming', 'house', 'end', 'game', 'bit', 'too', 'quickly', 'way', 'too', 'neatly', 'balance', 'movie', 'lot', 'weaknesses', 'are', 'forgiven', 'powerful', 'soundtrack', 'Aaron', 'Zigman', 'John', 'Q', 'Akeelah', 'Bee', 'T.I', 'song', 'Ride', 'Me']",N/A
995217,AIWIVN4UAFCA4,B000FS9UL2,"Linda Lou ""Obsessive reader, 6-10 books a wee...","[2, 2]","My age, the cast of rappers, and the Netflix synopsis here ordinarily would have made me pass this flick.  I couldn't take another ""sci-fi"" film about a rapper escaping the 'hood on a magic carpet woven from his dope rhymes!  But having lived outside Atlanta and being a professional in the record business ever since the city became a certified hip-hop mecca, I keep hoping that someone would see that the city's young people have more depth to them than gold teeth, do-rags and ""desperate house-B.A.P.S."".  I'm glad to say that writer Antwan Fisher and director Chris Robinson did not dissappoint me.  If you are from ""The Dirty South"", you'd know that ""ATL"" is a fairly accurate protrayal of what most of the kids growing up in the ""S.W.A.T."" (SW ATlanta) have to deal with while fighting to survive in the inner city.  The story is not a vehicle to showcase TI's rap talents - this is not ""8 Mile"" - it's a sensitive portrayal of four young black men at the crossroad of their lives.  In a country where the African-American male is an endangered species, and living past 21 is a major accomplishment, decisions about their futures are extremely critical. Although the message is well-worn and the ending predictable, Robinson compensates with great camera work which is not the usual music video to feature film fare with poor lighting and choppy editing.  Great location, such as the venerable Cascasde Family Skating Rink, provide authentic local color.  The outstanding soundtrack successfully moves the film along during bland scenes.  Kudos go out to the fine young cast who dish up excellent DEBUT performances.  Antwan ""Big Boi"" Patton's preppy drug dealer role successfully struggles with having to compete with his well-known celebrity as half of the talented musical duo OutKast.  But the stand-out performers are Tip ""TI"" Harris (Rashad), Jackie Long (Esquire), and Evan Ross (Antwan, aka,""Ant"").

Its really not that bad and is actually watchable and definitely enjoyable. ATL chronicles the life of four black men, Rashad(T.I.), Esquire(Jason Long), Brooklyn(Albert Daniels) and Teddy(Jason Weaver) and their growing up in Atlanta, Georgia.The acting is good and nobody is given in to fits of outrageous overacting in this movie. T.I and the rest of the cast act just like the laid back residents of Atlanta Georgia without coming out forced. Big Boi was better here than he was in Idlewild and Mykelti Williamson was better here than he was in Forrest Gump.Brief Spoilers: Rashad knows that his little brother ""Jellybean""(Evan Ross)is headed down the wrong path after catching him riding in the car with a local drug dealer(played by Big Boi of Outkast). He also has problems when he finds out that his gorgeous girlfriend, New New(Lauren London) lies about being loaded(believe it or not people have done stranger things than that).ATL has heart, is genuinely funny. It is also easy to follow and the characters(especially Rashad and his crew) are all likeable. Also T.I. and Lauren London make a good looking couple on screen. The chemistry between each character is not forced and the people in this movie actually talk to each other with a sense of civility without acting like crazed pitbulls on heroin. This movie might not address important issues in society but its not over the top ignorant and stereotypical like John Singleton's 2001 blooperfest(no names needed, you know what ""movie"" I'm talking about) I'll watch this movie over that monstrosity anyday because I feel at ease when Im watching ATL and I dont feel like Im being bombarded with wacky stereotypes and overacting. Just people that are misundertood and are trying to make sense of the situations they are given. This movie is strongly recommended to the crowd that rather see black people act like normal people and not like crazed jackals(like these brainless hood flicks that come out every month have them doing).Two thumbs up indeed.",5,"""Where it all began""",1227484800,"11 24, 2008",2008,2074,"['am', 'amazed', 'mixed', 'reviews', 'movie', 'garnered', 'really', 'not', 'bad', 'actually', 'watchable', 'definitely', 'enjoyable', 'ATL', 'life', 'four', 'black', 'men', 'Rashad', 'T.I', 'Esquire', 'Jason', 'Long', 'Brooklyn', 'Albert', 'Daniels', 'Teddy', 'Jason', 'Weaver', 'growing', 'up', 'Atlanta', 'Georgia.The', 'acting', 'good', 'nobody', 'given', 'fits', 'outrageous', 'overacting', 'movie', 'T.I', 'rest', 'cast', 'act', 'just', 'laid', 'back', 'residents', 'Atlanta', 'Georgia', 'coming', 'out', 'forced', 'Big', 'Boi', 'was', 'better', 'here', 'was', 'Idlewild', 'Mykelti', 'Williamson', 'was', 'better', 'here', 'was', 'Forrest', 'Gump.Brief', 'Spoilers', 'Rashad', 'little', 'brother', 'Jellybean', 'Evan', 'Ross', 'headed', 'down', 'wrong', 'path', 'catching', 'riding', 'car', 'local', 'drug', 'dealer', 'played', 'Big', 'Boi', 'Outkast', 'also', 'problems', 'when', 'out', 'gorgeous', 'girlfriend', 'New', 'New', 'Lauren', 'London', 'being', 'loaded', 'believe', 'not', 'people', 'have', 'done', 'stranger', 'things', '.ATL', 'heart', 'genuinely', 'funny', 'also', 'easy', 'follow', 'characters', 'especially', 'Rashad', 'crew', 'are', 'likeable', 'Also', 'T.I', 'Lauren', 'London', 'make', 'good', 'looking', 'couple', 'screen', 'chemistry', 'character', 'not', 'forced', 'people', 'movie', 'actually', 'talk', 'other', 'sense', 'civility', 'acting', 'crazed', 'pitbulls', 'heroin', 'movie', 'might', 'not', 'address', 'important', 'issues', 'society', 'not', 'top', 'ignorant', 'stereotypical', 'John', 'Singleton', '2001', 'blooperfest', 'names', 'needed', 'know', 'what', 'movie', ""'m"", 'talking', ""'ll"", 'watch', 'movie', 'monstrosity', 'anyday', 'feel', 'ease', 'when', 'Im', 'watching', 'ATL', 'dont', 'feel', 'Im', 'being', 'bombarded', 'wacky', 'stereotypes', 'overacting', 'Just', 'people', 'are', 'misundertood', 'are', 'trying', 'make', 'sense', 'situations', 'are', 'given', 'movie', 'strongly', 'recommended', 'crowd', 'rather', 'see', 'black', 'people', 'act', 'normal', 'people', 'not', 'crazed', 'jackals', 'brainless', 'hood', 'flicks', 'come', 'out', 'month', 'have', 'doing', '.Two', 'thumbs', 'up', 'indeed']",N/A

I saw this movie at the show when it first came out and DVDs do it no justice. The big screen gave it that soul from the music and the swagger that the movie carried the entire way through, but I had to have a copy of the DVD the day it came out anyway. Initially I just wanted to see T.I. and Big Boi acting, and see a few roller skating tricks.  Instead I got a thoughtful movie about one brother who, although is known throughout the streets, kept himself in a positive career path and held a lot of responsibility. Another brother tries to take the ""easy way out"" by heading straight to fast cash, with all the dangers implied beforehand. Several other lives of teenagers and grown-ups bring up questions of poverty, theft, fatherhood, education, loyalty, culture, pride in race, sell-outs, and relationships.But this movie is not totally serious: even the bad guy has enough swagger to make you want to get in his truck just ONE time. Several jokes are thrown out about all the serious topics above to make the audience laugh while they're crying about real life events in the hearts of Atlanta. I cracked up during the scene in the fast food restaurant where they talked about location vocabulary, because it reminded me of a conversation in my own book and constant jokes I heard throughout college about folks from out of town (me included).  The ""got some"" scene had me laughing as well.I know people from ATL had to be proud of this movie for representing them, because I was very impressed to watch it. T.I. did a fabulous acting job, Diana Ross' son Evan was impressive, Jason Weaver was the noticeable veteran along with some other well-known actors/actresses. Besides learning more about ATL's background, laughing at the comedic scenes, and pondering over the serious scenes, I was elated to see so many new faces (director included) mesh so well with veteran actors (producers included). I read a few reviews that said the dialogue was not on point, but I learned long ago that if someone is not from an area and they do not talk in this manner, they often find that the dialogue is not on point.  To those who criticized the dialogue, I'd suggest you make a trip to ATL, then come back and see if the dialogue is good.  As far as I'm concerned, it was a 5-star dialogue movie.  How someone who is not from a region can judge dialogue when SO many people IN the movie would speak this way is beyond me.  Had the dialogue not been cool, I can guarantee you that some of these folks would've spoken up (specifically Dallas Austin, T-boz, and T.I.)

995232,AXHMUN6GC0WEH,B000FS9UL2,"The Fancy One ""blackprincess""","[10, 10]","I came across this movie on cable recently and I was surprized - I really enjoyed it. I remember this movie came out last year about the same time as""Akeelah and the Bee""- another excellent film - but based on what I saw on the commercials for it, I said, ""Oh please, not ANOTHER hood movie with black kids shooting each other up"" and passed on it. I went to see ""Akeelah"" instead because it was being promoted as a movie with positive black characters, which we need more of. I enjoyed it but now after seeing ""ATL"", I realized seeing either one of those movies would have been a wise choice. ""ATL"" was definitely marketed the wrong way and fooled a lot of people, like it did me.Produced by Will Smith's production company, Overbrook Entertainment and based a story written by Antwone Fisher (who was himself the subject of a movie directed by Denzel Washington a few years back), ""ATL"" is far from being your typical black film about coming of age in the hood. It does show some instances of drug dealing and violence, but very few, and that is not the central focus of the story anyway. This is an urban tale with a message that is powerful - striving and working hard to achieve the better things in life in an honest fashion, and having some fun along the way. That includes Sunday nights at the Cascade - a popular roller rink on the southside of Atlanta, where all of the kids love to hang out and have a good time.  The focal point of ""ATL"" is on the lives and the camaraderie of four friends who ponder their futures as they approach graduation.Because I am not really into today's rap music, I was not too familiar with T.I., other than from his song that was a big hit last year, ""What You Know"". But I thought he showed wonderful potential in the starring role of Rashad, a poor, 17 year old high school kid who has a gift for art and lives with his janitor uncle because both of his parents were killed in an auto accident. He is extremely protective of his little brother, Ant (Evan Ross, Diana's son). Ant's only goal is to make big money and sport bling-bling, since he feels this is the only way he can gain some respect and attention. He decides to get on the fast track to obtain what he wants, but he's not quite ready to deal with the consequences.The supporting cast, which includes veteran actors Keith David, Lonette McKee, Mykelti Williamson (his poetic reading later in the film blew me away) and Jason Weaver as a high school super senior, was perfectly chosen. Lauren London, who plays New New, does a great job as a sassy, ghetto-fabulous diva with a secret. She and Rashad begin dating and their relationship is a mutual one until a chance event causes the truth to unfold. Also to take note of is the intelligent, proud and driven Esquire (Jackie Long) who has dreams of going to an Ivy League college but fears because of his parents' income and his background, his opportunities will be extremely limited. Big Boi from the hip-hop duo OutKast and singer Monica also appear in the film, although Big Boi's role is way more pivotal to the storyline, while Monica simply makes a cameo appearance.Think of this as sort of an updated, African-American version of ""American Graffiti"" - but one I can definitely relate to much more, with various intertwined stories of everyday life in the Georgia hood. Overall, this film speaks of dreams and aspirations - realized, potential, and yes, unachieved. ""ATL"" is inspirational in its own way - a humorous, touching and refreshing alternative to the typical films out there about growing up poor and black with the odds stacked against you. No, yall, you don't have to die trying to get rich. There is a better way!

995233,A2WFNNKUK3OC2X,B000FS9UL2,T. Winston,"[10, 26]","I do agree with the reviewer (G. Duenas) who said this was similar to that movie ""Rollbounce"".  Even ""Rollbounce"" was better than this.  This movie wasn't what I expected.  I assumed it was going to be about T.I.'s life growing up and how he became a rapper.  Instead he's playing a high school kid and I know in real life he has to be at least in his mid twenties.  With the title ""ATL"" you would think to see something a little hardcore especially since he's a rapper, but this film was lame.  It's nothing wrong in trying to relay a positive message, especially in black films where you typically see gangs, drugs and violence.T.I. can't act at all.  It seems that nowadays rappers are trying to be actors but T.I. is the worst.  He had no presence in the film and the other actors surely outshined him.  Big Boi was impressive to watch and kind of funny.  But they made him look like a punk beating up little kids because they didn't have his money.  Other scenes didn't make sense also.  When T.I. found out that his girlfriend really doesn't come from the ghetto and instead has a rich lifestyle he has a fit and then takes it out on his friends.  That was so pathetic.I really don't know why this movie was produced, it just didn't make sense overall.  The plot was okay but it just didn't capture my attention.  T.I.'s performance was very weak and to me he failed to connect with his character.  If you're interested in seeing this film I suggest you wait for it to come out on  DVD,  and if T.I. wants to star in more movies, attend an acting school quickly.",1,ATL - WACK,1144627200,"04 10, 2006",2006,1568,"['do', 'agree', 'reviewer', 'G.', 'Duenas', 'who', 'said', 'was', 'similar', 'movie', 'Rollbounce', 'Even', 'Rollbounce', 'was', 'better', 'movie', 'was', ""n't"", 'what', 'expected', 'assumed', 'was', 'going', 'be', 'T.I', 'life', 'growing', 'up', 'how', 'became', 'rapper', 'Instead', 'playing', 'high', 'school', 'kid', 'know', 'real', 'life', 'be', 'least', 'mid', 'twenties', 'title', 'ATL', 'would', 'think', 'see', 'something', 'little', 'hardcore', 'especially', 'rapper', 'film', 'was', 'lame', 'nothing', 'wrong', 'trying', 'relay', 'positive', 'message', 'especially', 'black', 'films', 'where', 'typically', 'see', 'gangs', 'drugs', 'violence.T.I', 'ca', ""n't"", 'act', 'nowadays', 'rappers', 'are', 'trying', 'be', 'actors', 'T.I', 'worst', 'had', 'presence', 'film', 'other', 'actors', 'surely', 'outshined', 'Big', 'Boi', 'was', 'impressive', 'watch', 'kind', 'funny', 'made', 'look', 'punk', 'beating', 'up', 'little', 'kids', 'did', ""n't"", 'have', 'money', 'Other', 'scenes', 'did', ""n't"", 'make', 'sense', 'also', 'When', 'T.I', 'found', 'out', 'girlfriend', 'really', ""n't"", 'come', 'ghetto', 'instead', 'rich', 'lifestyle', 'fit', 'then', 'out', 'friends', 'was', 'so', 'pathetic.I', 'really', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'why', 'movie', 'was', 'produced', 'just', 'did', ""n't"", 'make', 'sense', 'overall', 'plot', 'was', 'okay', 'just', 'did', ""n't"", 'capture', 'attention', 'T.I', 'performance', 'was', 'very', 'weak', 'failed', 'connect', 'character', ""'re"", 'interested', 'seeing', 'film', 'suggest', 'wait', 'come', 'out', 'DVD', 'T.I', 'star', 'more', 'movies', 'attend', 'acting', 'school', 'quickly']",N/A
