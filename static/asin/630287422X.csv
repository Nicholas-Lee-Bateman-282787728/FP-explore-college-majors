342448,A34GZPHWYPSY2T,630287422X,"E. Hernandez ""Call me Harry""","[3, 3]","VIBES was a hell of a film, a Deeply Personal favorite of 1988. It starred the immortal Cyndi Lauper as Sylvia Pickel (come on, it's Pickle), a plain-jane sort of gal who happens to be super-psychic. During a sinister fake university experiment, the evil Dr. Harrisson Steele (Julian Sands) chooses Sylvia and the goofy museum assistant/psychic Nick Deezy (Jeff Goldblum) to help him find, well, let's out with it: the Ecuadorian City of Gold, a/k/a Os Cete Cidades, a/k/a Cibola.Sylvia has been approached by the zany Harry Buscafusco (a hilarious Peter Falk), who breaks into her apartment to beg for help finding a lost relative. In reality, Harry is a con man who is Dr. Steele's competition. He manages to convince Sylvia to help him and he becomes even funnier as he expresses his boundless glee.This guy is like a HARRY POTTER character on wacky tobbacky. But then, so is Cyndi Lauper. There is of course a wild chase (with Sylvia, Harry and Nick) around the country and into Ecuador--with a classic shot of Falk dressed as one of the Natives--and a surprise psychic ending which I will not reveal, because everything is too much darned fun.I must make one aside here: Cyndi Lauper as an actress. It's mostly forgotten today, but I was there and I can tell you, she had a real and solid future in film. She was dramatic, funny, a total natural. Her musical career was close to being in shreds--thanks to Madonna's ripping her off in the mid-1980s. Sadly, since Madonna had already made the rotten DESPERATELY SEEKING SUSAN in 1985, Cyndi was between the sword and the wall.Is there any question who won (unfairly) this early fame face-off?I'll add that Jeff Goldblum was just taking off here as a film star; in this same year he did another 'goofball 1980s comdedy', EARTH GIRLS ARE EASY, costarring with a then-unknown Jim Carrey.The wife and I were huge fans of Cyndi Lauper and I was keenly hurt by Madonna forcing her out of the music scene by brazenly copying her...though people today will not recall that original version of Madonna. And here, not only was Lauper facing the three-year-old screen debut of Madonna, but she had other cinematic competition in this year. VIBES, a great, gentle, low-key comedy had to compete with the likes of BEETLEJUICE, BIG, DIE HARD, GORILLAS IN THE MIST (see my review), and the biggest monster of them all, RAIN MAN.Cyndi Lauper walked away from all entertainment after VIBES--only to reemerge in the world of silly wrestling. If you treasure Lauper's musical heritage, which is truly great, and if you love the quirky out-of-the-way comedies of the 1980s, GET THIS FILM. Out of all we'd seen and heard, the wife and I loved VIBES best of all. It's a classic, and it's a homage to Cyndi Lauper's immense talent.",5,Someone's had sex on this table,1278806400,"07 11, 2010",2010,2762,"['VIBES', 'was', 'hell', 'film', 'Deeply', 'Personal', 'favorite', '1988', 'starred', 'immortal', 'Cyndi', 'Lauper', 'Sylvia', 'Pickel', 'come', 'Pickle', 'plain-jane', 'sort', 'gal', 'who', 'be', 'super-psychic', 'sinister', 'fake', 'university', 'experiment', 'evil', 'Dr.', 'Harrisson', 'Steele', 'Julian', 'Sands', 'Sylvia', 'goofy', 'museum', 'Nick', 'Deezy', 'Jeff', 'Goldblum', 'help', 'find', 'well', 'let', 'out', 'Ecuadorian', 'City', 'Gold', 'a/k/a', 'Os', 'Cete', 'Cidades', 'a/k/a', 'Cibola.Sylvia', 'been', 'approached', 'zany', 'Harry', 'Buscafusco', 'hilarious', 'Peter', 'Falk', 'who', 'apartment', 'beg', 'help', 'finding', 'lost', 'relative', 'reality', 'Harry', 'con', 'man', 'who', 'Dr.', 'Steele', 'competition', 'convince', 'Sylvia', 'help', 'even', 'funnier', 'boundless', 'glee.This', 'guy', 'HARRY', 'POTTER', 'character', 'wacky', 'tobbacky', 'then', 'so', 'Cyndi', 'Lauper', 'course', 'wild', 'chase', 'Sylvia', 'Harry', 'Nick', 'country', 'Ecuador', 'classic', 'shot', 'Falk', 'dressed', 'one', 'Natives', 'surprise', 'psychic', 'ending', 'will', 'not', 'reveal', 'everything', 'too', 'much', 'darned', 'fun.I', 'must', 'make', 'one', 'aside', 'here', 'Cyndi', 'Lauper', 'actress', 'mostly', 'forgotten', 'today', 'was', 'there', 'can', 'tell', 'had', 'real', 'solid', 'future', 'film', 'was', 'dramatic', 'funny', 'total', 'natural', 'musical', 'career', 'was', 'close', 'being', 'shreds', 'thanks', 'Madonna', 'ripping', 'off', 'mid-1980s', 'Sadly', 'Madonna', 'had', 'already', 'made', 'rotten', 'DESPERATELY', 'SEEKING', 'SUSAN', '1985', 'Cyndi', 'was', 'sword', 'wall.Is', 'there', 'question', 'who', 'won', 'unfairly', 'early', 'fame', 'face-off', ""'ll"", 'add', 'Jeff', 'Goldblum', 'was', 'just', 'taking', 'off', 'here', 'film', 'star', 'same', 'year', 'did', ""'goofball"", '1980s', 'comdedy', 'EARTH', 'GIRLS', 'ARE', 'EASY', 'costarring', 'then-unknown', 'Jim', 'Carrey.The', 'wife', 'were', 'huge', 'fans', 'Cyndi', 'Lauper', 'was', 'keenly', 'hurt', 'Madonna', 'forcing', 'out', 'music', 'scene', 'brazenly', 'copying', 'people', 'today', 'will', 'not', 'recall', 'original', 'version', 'Madonna', 'here', 'not', 'only', 'was', 'Lauper', 'facing', 'three-year-old', 'screen', 'debut', 'Madonna', 'had', 'other', 'cinematic', 'competition', 'year', 'VIBES', 'great', 'gentle', 'low-key', 'comedy', 'had', 'compete', 'likes', 'BEETLEJUICE', 'BIG', 'DIE', 'HARD', 'GORILLAS', 'IN', 'THE', 'MIST', 'see', 'review', 'biggest', 'monster', 'RAIN', 'MAN.Cyndi', 'Lauper', 'walked', 'away', 'entertainment', 'VIBES', 'only', 'reemerge', 'world', 'silly', 'wrestling', 'treasure', 'Lauper', 'musical', 'heritage', 'truly', 'great', 'love', 'quirky', 'out-of-the-way', 'comedies', '1980s', 'GET', 'THIS', 'FILM', ""'d"", 'seen', 'heard', 'wife', 'loved', 'VIBES', 'best', 'classic', 'homage', 'Cyndi', 'Lauper', 'immense', 'talent']",N/A

Not that current movies aren't fun to watch. But most people who look back on the 80's will probably know what I mean in how they have a certain distinctive quality to them. Well enough nostalgia.&quot;Vibes,&quot; while made in the late 80's, certainly has all the great qualities that define movies from that decade. Cyndi Lauper and Jeff Goldblum star in the main roles as psychics who are conned by a stranger (Peter Falk) to travel to Ecuador in order to use their special abilities to help locate his missing son, only to find out once they arrive that they're really there to help locate a mysterious lost treasure with amazing powers. From there on it's a race against the bad guys to find this treasure, with many adventures along the way.This movie never drags or gets boring. Cyndi and Jeff have great chemistry together and do a nice job of playing their roles. I could have done without having to hear Cyndi use profanity (I'm a huge fan of hers but I believe that swearing is NOT a requirement for a movie, regardless of who's the one saying it). But fortunately it only happens once or twice so I suppose it can be overlooked.All in all, I think &quot;Vibes&quot; would make a great addition to anyone's movie collection.

These characters seem to be written just specifically for the actors. either that or the table read made lots of changes. the words match the special way that each of these actors speaks. Now with a great many actors (Jim Carey, Adam Sandler, Tom Cruise, John Travolta) letting the actors go off on their own inevitably causes the movie to suffer, either from cost overruns due to all the extra time from improvisation, irritated directors and crews for the overruns, or from just too much of that actor that the story suffers in the long run.Not so here, I promise.First though, you absolutely have to enjoy these actors, especially Cyndi Lauper. Back in 88 she was known for being quirky and creatively out of control (who remembers her as the wrestling manager for Captain Lou Albano) and of course her videos, which helped keep an audience for MTV, back when it had some relevance to music, or entertainment, or really to anything except exploiting the stupidity of people when you point a camera at them.Likewise I have always been a fan of Jeff Goldblum. I just like the way he speaks his lines, the pauses, the looks. Peter Falk is the same way, if you remember Columbo, you remember that certain way he delivered his lines.This was actually a hallmark of the 80s. actors were characters pretty much the same no matter what role it was. William Shatner is famously made fun of through out his career for this very thing. Back then most every actor was like that. another hallmark of 80s movies is that knew how to write endings. endings that actually tied up all the plotlines.the movie is a very well written comedy. every character introduced has an actual reason to be there.",5,Jeff Goldblum as Jeff Goldblum.

Cyndi Lauper who we all know who sings ""Girls Just Wanna Have Fun"".  But, when you see them try acting you think to yourself, ""Can they act as good as they sing?""  Well in her first movie debut, I think so.  In VIBES, Cyndi plays a psychic Sylvia Pickel she has this friend who's on the other side named Louise that she converses to for help.  She meets other psychics one particular, Nick Deezy (Jeff Goldblum, Independance Day, Earth Girls Are Easy) who has the ability to touch anything and know where it's been.  Way over in South America, an archaeologist disappears because of a city of gold that he discovered and is sacred and vanishes.Harry Buscafusco played by COLUMBO actor Peter Falk comes to Sylvia and Nick he asks them to come to South America to help him find his son.The amazing part of this movie shows where Lauper touches the relic they find, and she starts reading in tongues in some foreign language whats on the pyramid and it starts to crumble and Louise Sylvia's other side friend rescues her from the pyramid and saves her and Nick from the bad guys that got them at gun point to get the gold.

Packed with verbal comedy, facial expression contortionist Jeff Goldblum, loopy quips, and ditzy Cyndi Lauper, this Ken Kwapis-directed adventure film is worth a look, especially for fans of (not so) perilous journeys and silly excitement.At a Department of Paranormal Studies research center, Dr. Steele gathers several of the most brilliant psychics to help him with a special project. The two brightest of the bunch are Sylvia Pickel (Cyndi Lauper's acting debut), the epitome of incredibly sexy but dumb-blond girls, and Nick Deezy (a young Jeff Goldblum), a museum employee who prefers not to sacrifice his humanity to be used as a walking Ouija board. His specialty is psychometry, the ability to touch objects and see where they've been - his other gift is skepticism. Sylvia, on the other hand, is accompanied by invisible friend Louise from the ""other side"" who forewarns her of dangerous events. She also deals with astral projection, the power to place conscience awareness outside of the physical body - and bad luck with manipulative men (Steve Buscemi makes a brief appearance) and utter losers: ""my last boyfriend was a guy who drank soup by putting his head in it.""Harry Buscafusco (Peter Falk) recruits the two talented psychics (for a cool $50,000 in counterfeit bills) on an expedition into the mountains of Ecuador, where they hope to find his missing son. But the mission leads the trio into danger and disaster when it's revealed that they're really in search of hidden Incan treasures - with supernatural powers!With 3-foot-tall multi-colored hair, bright makeup, squeaky voice and loud clothing, Cyndi Lauper is surprisingly entertaining as Sylvia, and brings a pleasantly contrasting character to Goldblum's straight-laced, sensible Nick. The two have an undeniable chemistry, filled with giddy flirtations and lots of cheesy one-liners. Add to that the dawdling and obnoxious villain Ingo (Googy Gress), Falk's rapid-fire jokes, a consistently kooky tone, music by James Horner, and Lauper's luscious legs, and Vibes isn't such a bad way to spend 99 minutes.- Mike Massie",3,Vibes Movie Review from The Massie Twins,1234396800,"02 12, 2009",2009,2192,"['1988', 'Vibes', 'definitely', 'cheesy', 'wholeheartedly', 'light', 'flamboyant', 'funnily', 'romantic', 'Packed', 'verbal', 'comedy', 'facial', 'expression', 'contortionist', 'Jeff', 'Goldblum', 'loopy', 'quips', 'ditzy', 'Cyndi', 'Lauper', 'Ken', 'Kwapis-directed', 'adventure', 'film', 'look', 'especially', 'fans', 'not', 'so', 'perilous', 'journeys', 'silly', 'excitement.At', 'Department', 'Paranormal', 'Studies', 'research', 'center', 'Dr.', 'Steele', 'gathers', 'several', 'most', 'brilliant', 'psychics', 'help', 'special', 'project', 'two', 'brightest', 'bunch', 'are', 'Sylvia', 'Pickel', 'Cyndi', 'Lauper', 'acting', 'debut', 'epitome', 'incredibly', 'sexy', 'dumb-blond', 'girls', 'Nick', 'Deezy', 'young', 'Jeff', 'Goldblum', 'museum', 'employee', 'who', 'not', 'sacrifice', 'humanity', 'be', 'used', 'walking', 'Ouija', 'board', 'specialty', 'psychometry', 'ability', 'touch', 'objects', 'see', 'where', ""'ve"", 'been', 'other', 'gift', 'skepticism', 'Sylvia', 'other', 'hand', 'accompanied', 'invisible', 'friend', 'Louise', 'other', 'side', 'who', 'dangerous', 'events', 'also', 'astral', 'projection', 'power', 'place', 'conscience', 'awareness', 'physical', 'body', 'bad', 'luck', 'manipulative', 'men', 'Steve', 'Buscemi', 'brief', 'appearance', 'utter', 'losers', 'last', 'boyfriend', 'was', 'guy', 'who', 'soup', 'putting', 'head', 'Harry', 'Buscafusco', 'Peter', 'Falk', 'two', 'talented', 'psychics', 'cool', '50,000', 'counterfeit', 'bills', 'expedition', 'mountains', 'Ecuador', 'where', 'hope', 'find', 'missing', 'son', 'mission', 'trio', 'danger', 'disaster', 'when', 'revealed', ""'re"", 'really', 'search', 'hidden', 'Incan', 'supernatural', 'powers', '3-foot-tall', 'multi-colored', 'hair', 'bright', 'makeup', 'squeaky', 'voice', 'loud', 'clothing', 'Cyndi', 'Lauper', 'surprisingly', 'entertaining', 'Sylvia', 'pleasantly', 'contrasting', 'character', 'Goldblum', 'straight-laced', 'sensible', 'Nick', 'two', 'have', 'undeniable', 'chemistry', 'filled', 'giddy', 'flirtations', 'lots', 'cheesy', 'one-liners', 'Add', 'dawdling', 'obnoxious', 'villain', 'Ingo', 'Googy', 'Gress', 'Falk', 'rapid-fire', 'jokes', 'consistently', 'tone', 'music', 'James', 'Horner', 'Lauper', 'luscious', 'legs', 'Vibes', ""n't"", 'such', 'bad', 'way', 'spend', '99', 'minutes.-', 'Mike', 'Massie']",N/A
