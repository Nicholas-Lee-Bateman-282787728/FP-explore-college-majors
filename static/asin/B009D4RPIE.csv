Depending on how open you are to change this could be great news or a really bad one. John Barnaby, the main character (Neil Dudgeon) proves himself without a doubt. You cannot compare him to John Nettles/ Tom Barnaby as the whole setup and experience is different.The writer's efforts to make the new seasons more up-to-date failed. The wife (Fiona Dolman, an attractive actress) is busier than her husband; and she does not contribute to the plot; even as it is now a day with sex scenes once a week/15 days/a month??  A much better job is performed by the dog - his real companion. Are the writers trying to be politically correct with female audience??They spend too much time reconstructing gruesome killing scenes (worse than CSI) reaching a point of disgusting when trying to explain who did it and how it was done.

1594965,A2HPUXRSATB9EC,B009D4RPIE,"Ellen Wertheimer ""British novel reader""","[1, 1]","I have good news and bad news about the new Inspector Barnaby series.First, the good news.  I think that Neil Dudgeon is wonderful as Inspector Barnaby.  He is engaging, clever, and adorable.  His wife and his dog are equally appealing.  Moreover, by the time the viewer gets to Oblong Murders (the best of the four new episodes), he has worked out his relationship with Jones, and the two have become a team.Now, the bad news.  The plots of these new episodes are truly terrible.  They are starting to resemble the old TV series &#34;The Wild, Wild West&#34; in placing Inspector Barnaby into ridiculous and almost farcical physical peril, equally absurdly resolved.  With the possible exception of the fourth episode, they rely exclusively on homicidal maniacs, although even in the fourth episode the culprit was far from rational.  A further flaw is that Inspector Barnaby does not detect so much as he trips over the culprit, often at great risk to his physical well-being.  (Why the presence of a safe implies the existence of an IOU I cannot imagine.)Please, screenwriters, get yourself some plots.  Find some relatively obscure, no-longer-copyrighted Golden Age mysteries and use them as the basis for village mysteries in the true Midsomer tradition.  Otherwise, the series is well on its way to becoming repetitive and ridiculous.  If this trend continues, not even the presence of Neil Dudgeon will be able to redeem it.",3,Good news and bad news about the new Inspector Barnaby series,1361059200,"02 17, 2013",2013,1431,"['have', 'good', 'news', 'bad', 'news', 'new', 'Inspector', 'Barnaby', 'series.First', 'good', 'news', 'think', 'Neil', 'Dudgeon', 'wonderful', 'Inspector', 'Barnaby', 'engaging', 'clever', 'adorable', 'wife', 'dog', 'are', 'equally', 'appealing', 'Moreover', 'time', 'viewer', 'Oblong', 'Murders', 'best', 'four', 'new', 'episodes', 'worked', 'out', 'relationship', 'Jones', 'two', 'have', 'become', 'team.Now', 'bad', 'news', 'plots', 'new', 'episodes', 'are', 'truly', 'terrible', 'are', 'starting', 'resemble', 'old', 'TV', 'series', '34', 'Wild', 'Wild', 'West', '34', 'placing', 'Inspector', 'Barnaby', 'ridiculous', 'almost', 'farcical', 'physical', 'peril', 'equally', 'absurdly', 'resolved', 'possible', 'exception', 'fourth', 'episode', 'rely', 'exclusively', 'homicidal', 'maniacs', 'even', 'fourth', 'episode', 'culprit', 'was', 'far', 'rational', 'further', 'flaw', 'Inspector', 'Barnaby', 'not', 'detect', 'so', 'much', 'culprit', 'often', 'great', 'risk', 'physical', 'well-being', 'Why', 'presence', 'safe', 'existence', 'IOU', 'can', 'not', 'imagine', 'Please', 'screenwriters', 'get', 'plots', 'Find', 'relatively', 'obscure', 'no-longer-copyrighted', 'Golden', 'Age', 'mysteries', 'use', 'basis', 'village', 'mysteries', 'true', 'Midsomer', 'tradition', 'Otherwise', 'series', 'well', 'way', 'becoming', 'repetitive', 'ridiculous', 'trend', 'not', 'even', 'presence', 'Neil', 'Dudgeon', 'will', 'be', 'able', 'redeem']",Midsomer Murders - Set 21

As if the original writers of the series was sick and  ghost writers put in their place till Barnaby retire. Well, here comes the big day, package arrives, I get ready to go through all four shows in one night. What happens, I am so easily distracted that it took me 2 days to finish ONE story. I start to watch a second one and cannot get interested. Actually stop it after 15 minutes and put in one of the others, don't recall what distracted me, (maybe signing for a package), but never finished that one. Fell asleep on my final attempt, to see if it was me, Well the housekeeper usually sits down with me, she got up to finish chores. Asked her if she wanted to take the DVDs home and watch it with her daughter. They came back the next day. Finally I go to my elderly mother, gave her the box and explained what was happening. Well, she says she does not want them, they don't hold her interest. I felt DCI John Barnaby was not a strong leading character. His role being laid back should of have stronger supporting actors around him. Neither characters were interesting, driven, ""We will get to the bottom this"". I am sad, actually in morning. This was one of several Series that got me thru 11 months of hospital and nursing home stays. When the ""Morse (John Thaw) series ended with Morse's death, they smoothly promoted DS (Detective Sergeant) Robert Lewis to Inspector and DS James Hathaway becomes his permanent bagman. I have truly seen how important it is to have the correct leading actor for a role, a good story line, the best script writers, and the best supporting actors, and casting for the role. T series. In this series forced ending changes, perhaps Inspector Barnaby should have just retired with his wife Joyce having all kinds of things for him to do around the house. e.g. Adding on a guest room, closing in that screened patio. Then they find out his newlywed daughter and husband will being moving in with them until their financial situation improves, just a few months. But then his daughter gets some surprising news from a pregnancy test that was routinely performed for new role she just was chosen for.

1594968,A3LQDYVAAHHV2T,B009D4RPIE,FYI,"[106, 112]","Midsomer County is oddly rife with peculiar mysteries and creative demises, but DCI John Barnaby is as gifted with powers of keen observation as his cousin, retired DCI Tom Barnaby. Sykes, John Barnaby's expressive dog, is also welcome! Neil Dudgeon, as the new DCI Barnaby, is an excellent addition to Midsomer, with his capacity for nuance; humor and seriousness shadow his countenance. The Barnabys are an old Midsomer family; in this verdant environment there are often recurring family resemblances (recall the funereal duo in first Midsomer mystery, ""The Killings of Badger's Drift""). An amorous ""look-alike"" gardener was featured earlier in Midsomer, likely DCI John Barnaby is also good with plants. As always, the intrepid Jason Hughes is a wonderful foil as Detective Inspector Ben Jones, his wry humor adds another level of complexity to the series. The U.K. boasts many fine, underrated actors. Catch Dudgeon as a WWI vet/chauffeur inThe Mrs. Bradley Mysteries - Series 1 (Speedy Death/The Mrs. Bradley Mysteries), which, despite the confusing title, is the complete set (no need to order a separate ""Series 2.""). We love the weird, unique Midsomer music, indicating that beneath Midsomer's quaintness, benign as a quivering vanilla blanc mange, danger lurks. Note the badger emblem on the police cars. In the U.K., coziness is often leavened with the macabre, like a doily blotched with tea, darkness lurks at the edges. And we love it. Brits have knack for mixing classic stories with ghoulish humor and sharp observations of the flawed human character. Historically, penny-dreadfuls were published at Christmastime, as in Robert Louis Stevenson and Charles Dickens. The denizens of the dangerous environs of Midsomer county inflict and suffer numerous creative malaises.The four episodes in this collection are each 90 minutes long, and have helpful subtitles. But several have missteps, no fault of the cast, that may disappoint dedicated fans. The first episode, ""Death in the Slow Lane,"" is a somewhat disorienting introduction to DCI John Barnaby. Producer Brian True-May inflicts shrill drug taking schoolgirls on viewers. Where is screenwriter Tony Horowitz when you need him? Later, the third episode, ""Echos of the Dead,"" panders to graphic CSI style, featuring a dismembered female corpse, with a saw placed on her bare rear-end. This gratuitously lacks the dry humor of Midsomer classics, as in the memorable murder via trebuchet and wine bottles.Death in the Slow LaneDCI John Barnaby, a cousin of our original curmudgeon, is wonderfully played by Neil Dudgeon. And he has a dog companion, the emotive Sykes; England, this blessed plot, rife with delightful dogs and detectives. Midsomer's classic formula features charming villages with a high body-count. But this episode, written by Michael Aitkens, despite moments of great dialogue, is off-kilter. The trite titillation of chattering schoolgirls is a malformation of Midsomer, straining to be topical; a poor way to meet new DCI John Barnaby at work! Barnaby's relationship with DI Ben Jones (expertly played by the wry Welsh-humored Jason Hughes) is off to an uneven start. All is not well at a girls' boarding school. Was a past death really suicide? There are hints at some form of incest, a relatively (pun intended) common Midsomer sin. A local DJ is stabbed by a gorgeous red sports car prior to his judging a classic car show. His body being rolled-away on a gurney, weapon wobbling, is classic Midsomer. A humorous aspersion is cast at redheads/ginger, ""they are all sex-mad and ill-tempered."" The best scenes involve Barnaby being greeted as ""Tom,"" meeting his overly-friendly neighbors, and enjoying delightful conversations with his precocious dog.Dark SecretsThis episode, again written by Michael Aitkens, again features quaffs of incest on the menu. But ""Dark Secrets"" boasts the classic Midsomer oeuvre viewers expect, with a rambling old manor amidst gorgeous English countryside The mansion is inhabited by eccentrics, William Bingham (Edward Fox) and his wife Mary (the wonderful Phyllida Law). They rattle about, subsiding on tea and pizza delivery. Our DCI John Barnaby's wife, Sarah (Fiona Dolman), arrives in Midsomer to find that her husband has neglected to unpack. She is the new head teacher at Causton Comprehensive, and receives an unenthusiastic welcome, though she finds a clever way to unpack. Meanwhile, after the body of a social worker is found floating in a river, the reclusive Bingham couple come under police scrutiny. Barnaby and Jones unearth scandalous family secrets, and decipher astronomical charts to discover the murderer. This episode continues a Midsomer theme: a generation went wrong in the 1960/70s, threw off Edwardian sensibilities, and replaced repression with indulgence, to the harm of future generations.Echoes of the DeadDespite beauty of Midsomer village Great Worthy, this episode, written by Peter J. Hammond, is like spoiled clotted cream. Producer Brian True-May goes awry with the second murder's exploitative, graphic ugliness; it has none of the macabre humor true to Midsomer's spirit. You know things are off when the dialogue descends to discussing ""butt-plugs."" Newly single Dianne Price is discovered strangled, dressed like a bride, and laid out in a bath. A lipstick-written warning is scrawled on the bathroom mirror. At first, all seems like vintage Misdomer. The incident spurs copycat wedding-themed murders. Barnaby and Jones investigate a host of suspects, including a corrupt ex-colleague of Ben's, an cop who runs a pub with a former brothel madam, who happens to be his wife. But (yet again) religious fanatics are the worst culprits. The detectives realize that the cases have eerie similarities to past notorious murders. If only they resembled Midsomer's infamous, but charming, macabre heritage.Oblong MurdersThe best of the lot; sharp dialogue stands out in this last episode, written by reliable Midsomer vet David Hoskins. The opening scenes wonderfully depict the world from a dog's eye-view. John Barnaby takes his dog Sykes for a ramble along a path, passing other dogs being walked along the way. Later, forensic medical specialist David Bollard (John Barnaby once called him bullock) asks Barnaby to help find Lucy Oliver, a daughter of his friends. She went missing after becoming involved with a secretive new-age cult, the Oblong Foundation, located at Malham Hall. Long-suffering DI Ben Jones is forced to forgo his vacation to go undercover among the cultists. Finally, viewers see his old humor and charm return (the prior episodes turned him dour). He discovers that the accidental deaths involving the previous owners of Malham Hall may have been murder. Jones copes with several eager females, while navigating the Oblong Foundation's philosophies (""be a tree"") promulgating free-love. He discovers money-laundering, and a secret relationship between an Oblong Foundation leader and the missing girl. Fortunately, Ben is intrepid and fast on his feet! And Sykes make some new friends.Hopefully Midsomer will hit its stride, providing an exceptional cast with more worthy material. I also highly recommend the gritty Northumberland, U.K., mystery series, featuring the wonderful Brenda Blethyn:VeraandVera: Set 2.",5,Macabre Midsomer,1352332800,"11 8, 2012",2012,7296,"['Midsomer',

Don't get me wrong, I've always been a fan of Neil Dudgeon, but there's only one Tom Barnaby. This series combines frequent supernatural-ish plots with a bit of eerieness. It also has that necessary bit of comedy I like thrown into a mystery series. It covers the personal life of the main character, without detracting one iota from the main plot, and even includes Barnaby's family in the mystery now and then.

1594971,AL1WBEKIEPUPE,B009D4RPIE,"GEORGE RANNIE ""GWRJWMCL""","[0, 0]","As a very long-time fan of the British murder/mystery series ""Midsomer Murders"", I purchased Season twenty-one (21), of the series, with some trepidation because of John Nettles' retirement from the series.  Having watched ""Midsomer Murders"" for so many years (since its inception) with John Nettles as DCI Tom Barnaby who became (with his wonderful mellow ways) like a beloved relative to me.  Now, of course, that is foregone with his departure and that now his character has been replaced by his cousin, in the series, DCI John Barnaby.Season Twenty-one (21) of ""Midsomer Murders"" splendidly introduces to the viewing audience, the ""new"" DCI OF John Barnaby's sleuthing skills with four (4) finally written, directed and acted ninety (90) minute episodes that, per usual, ""paint"" the cozy village of Midsomer as beautiful and peaceful on the surface while, at the same time, below the surface the Midsomer village and its surroundings are rife with many  scandals even murders.DCI John Barnaby, as his cousin Tom, has keen insights and detective skills well able to solve the many unfortunate demises of Midsomer's inhabitants.  Neil Dudgeon splendidly acts the ""new"" DCI with ""dry"" humor and a very mellow demeanor talking to his very smart and also very mellow dog Sykes while seeking some guidance from him. In Season twenty-one (21), I really liked John Barnaby (as acted by Dudgeon) while still adoring John Hughes as his assistant, Ben Jones along with John Barnaby's dog and I certainly plan on watching  subsequent episodes.If you've previously enjoyed ""Midsomer Murders"" feel free to purchase Season twenty-one (21) of the series because it continues a very fine tradition of darn good murder/mysteries that are greatly acted and directed.

1594974,AO1Z0TQWCRGL4,B009D4RPIE,"Harold Wolf ""Doc""","[9, 10]","As Barnaby said, ""Hang on to the poetry."" Same beautiful Midsomer village/country vistas. Same multi-thread plots with multi-murders (3-4 in each ep). Character richness with extensive use of top British stars. Mixes mystery & humor behind the same haunting orchestra. Still one of TVs best crime shows, with even more episodes to be released. Still a UK hit, and with most USA fans.DCI J.Barnaby uses a good bit more humor, cryptic in detective style. I like that! He's not shy about rule breaking--old family trait. Returning regulars with higher prominence are DS Jones (Jason Hughes) and Dr Bullard (Barry Jackson); as well as returning veteran writers & directors. Quality remains.SUBTITLES for each of four 93 min mysteries, widescreen, Blu-ray Aspect Ratio: 1080p/16:9, and expect disturbing images, it is multiple murder as normal for Midsomer.1 --DEATH IN THE SLOW LANE82rd episode, first with Neil Dudgeon as head Barnaby sleuth. Locals know and love DS Jones. A 1960's race driver's death gets a fresh look while Jones & Barnaby work out a more amiable form of sleuthing. Friction persists.Downton Abbey's Samantha Bond as Kate, with her ex (Tim Dutton) also conflict. Kate's dad (David Warner) is involved as a car judge and a twist. The show offers a delightful look at vintage cars. Is red hair a red herring? David Aitkens (Waiting for God) writes the first 2 episodes, not new to MM, exactly like all the writers and directors. Caroline Graham's writing characters continue; only a few retirees.2 --DARK SECRETSScottish lass and beauty Fiona Dolman joins the permanent cast for many episodes to come as Sarah, Mrs. JB. On the crime plot, secrets & scandals block paths to a killer. A Social Servant visits dolally recluses William (Edward Fox) & Mary Bingham (Phyllida Law- Emma Thompson's ma), then is killed. Bingham daughter Selina (Beth Goddard) & hubby, Eddie Stanton (Neil Pearson) helps Barnaby visit the old couple prior to her murder. Watch for Ben (Julian Ovenden -Andrew Foyle & ""Forsyte Saga"") and Dr. Frost (John Quentin). These episodes are packed with stars, too many to mention them all. Jones to the dirty rescue again?3 --ECHOES OF THE DEAD with female nudityCopycat killer and the body count rises. Victim's flat mate Jo (Sarah Smart) works at a donkey sanctuary owned by Liz (Pam Ferris -Rosemary & Thyme) with a landlord Bernard (Ron Cook -Little Dorrit) who's a peeping Tom. Deaths mount with the connecting theme of marriage. Plenty of suspects and bodies and Jones rescues victim 5.4 THE OBLONG MURDERS with DS Jones nudityDr. Bullard's friend's daughter is missing from Oblong Foundation (new age- Obbies). The director is Freddie (Josephine Butler and new members include Blaze (Christine Bottomley -Hope Springs). In the local pub you'll meet Paddy (Kevin Doyle), Claire (Holly Aird) and Commodore (John Woodvine). Jones must go undercover & finds past deaths as suspicious. Meanwhile, the Barnaby's find a dog minder in Millie (Barbara Flynn -Cranford, and so much more). Again, huge star list.Quote by Dr. Ballard (his 76th episode) to DCI Barnaby, after announcing his Irish fishing holiday: ""Tom was a hard act to follow. You're getting there.""Bottom line: Near perfection in acting, writing, drama, dialogue, guest stars, and new roles freshen the series that's continuing a trend setter started in 1997. New friends in Midsomer Murder make this show as good as ever. My wife and I can't wait for another DVD set.

1594979,AD50CYPEWH6NN,B009D4RPIE,Jon Wynne,"[2, 2]","The moment of truth has finally come (to North America, at least). In the UK, MIDSOMER MURDERS, the phenomenally successful mystery program that turns the idea of tranquil, peaceful rural England on its ear, has been continuing its success since the departure of the wonderful John Nettles as DCI Tom Barnaby. Devotees of the series will know that Nettles decided to leave the show and the producers chose to replace him with Neil Dudgeon as Tom&#8217;s cousin, John Barnaby. The previous set (Set 20) of MIDSOMER MURDERS released in North America by Acorn Media saw John Nettles&#8217; final episodes. In the UK, viewers have had the opportunity for a few years now to appreciate the new blood on the program.The response in the UK to Dudgeon&#8217;s character has been very positive and for good reason. The show&#8217;s creators have found just the right balance in bringing John Barnaby into Midsomer, the fictional murder capitol of England. Wisely, Jason Hughes as Barnaby&#8217;s sidekick DS Ben Jones has been retained as has Barry Jackson (for now) as the Medical Examiner. These two characters give the show its obvious continuity from when Nettles was the star.Understandably there are some ruffled feathers as they all get to know one another. This provides some of the fun watching the new episodes.Particularly delightful is the new Barnaby&#8217;s dog, Sykes. Barnaby loves to talk to his faithful companion, particularly in the first episode before John&#8217;s wife arrives to take over being headmistress (Principal) of the local school. The scruffy terrier is adorable and always up for a little fun. In his moments, he&#8217;s Costello to Dudgeon&#8217;s Abbott; a punchline is always safe in Sykes&#8217; hands&#8230; paws.As for the mysteries themselves, the first two are top notch, with wonderful guest stars complementing the outstanding regular leads. Samantha Bond is back for her third guest-starring appearance in the first episode, &#8220;Death in the Slow Lane&#8221;. This episode also features a return to classic MIDSOMER form in the way it cleverly dispatches its first victim. Murder by Crankshaft, anyone? And mention must also be made of the classically beautiful model/actress Clara Paget doing an absolutely priceless turn as a stupidly spoiled young vamp. She clearly modeled the character after Paris Hilton, right down to the walk &#8211; now you already know how much you want her to get her comeuppance in the end!Part of the enjoyment of these programs is the array of talent that appears. Edward Fox play an eccentric recluse in the second mystery, &#8220;Dark Secrets&#8221;. As always, he is sensational, with his distinct, drawn-out speech pattern emphasized to give added colour to his impressive characterization.All is not well, however, and when we arrive at the third episode of this set, &#8220;Echoes of the Dead&#8221;, we are subjected to possibly one of the poorest Midsomer mysteries on offer. The occasional bad script can be forgiven, but in this case the sin is compounded by a return to a most troubling recurring characteristic about this (and other British) program(s): namely, the blatant anti-Christian tone. One could confidently place bets that whenever a character appears on MIDSOMER MURDERS who professes to be a Christian (not even a person of faith but specifically a Christian), they will turn out to be a nut case and/or the murderer. This is not only lazy writing, it is prejudice, pure and simple. MIDSOMER MURDERS is a great show, most of the time, but this propensity for perpetuating a negative stereotype is unacceptable. John Barnaby has already, in an earlier episode, announced that he does not believe in God, but his atheism has yet to be pursued in any meaningful way as an insight into the character, so who cares? Maybe Tom was an atheist too &#8211; he never said because it doesn&#8217;t matter! Who cares unless it affects the way he solves a murder. Using such an obvious tell over and over in a mystery series is beyond boring, it&#8217;s insulting to the viewer&#8217;s intelligence. The attack on an identifiable group of people is inappropriate. The lack of effort in the writing is deeply disappointing. One can only hope they&#8217;ve found some new writers.The fourth episode in Set 21 is &#8220;The Oblong Murders&#8221;. This one is a lot of fun because DS Jones has a lot more to do than usual. He goes undercover to investigate the disappearance of a young woman who joined a cult. (If the shots the show normally aims at Christianity were aimed at fictional groups as in this episode, all would be well &#8211; actually funny and no one is specifically targeted.) This story isn&#8217;t derailed by misplaced political correctness or soap-box mounting. It takes aim at pseudo-celebrity self-realization gurus spouting vague pop-psychology mumbo-jumbo to people with too much money and not enough sense. (&#8220;Be your own tree!&#8221;) Cosmo (DS Jones&#8217; undercover pseudonym) and his new friend Blaze (Christine Bottomley, &#8220;Hope Springs&#8221;) battle the sinister and the insipid simultaneously in a twisted tale with the body count mounting practically in front of their eyes!Jones has two beautiful women after him while pretending to be someone else and is quite exposed (saved only by tight editing) in a shower scene and is suitably confused, frustrated and uncomfortable, giving the episode that light-hearted touch that makes this &#8220;cop show&#8221; stand out from the crowd. This is most welcome as the overall flavour of these four episodes (some good, some not) is bleaker than what we have come to expect from the idyllic English countryside manifested in MIDSOMER MURDERS.We&#8217;ll have to wait and see whether or not the darker tone prevalent in three of these four episodes is now the dominant theme. Nonetheless, MIDSOMER MURDERS will always be good entertainment (most of the time) and will undoubtedly have a loyal following, if only on the strength of its great characters. One must simply expect and accept some growing pains as the series undergoes such a major overhaul. It was never going to be easy to say goodbye to John Nettles. That much has always been obvious. A little patience is required at this juncture to give us all a chance to adjust.Here&#8217;s hoping that future episodes are more consistent than Set 21.",4,Falters a bit.,1397433600,"04 14,

1594982,AS0H5UBCKPF3R,B009D4RPIE,"L. B. ""Bea""","[59, 62]","Midsomer Murders used to provide a mystery to unravel at a slow, leisurely pace amid the lovely setting of an English village and its eccentric inhabitants.  Murder was the propelling force for action, but the real focus was on characterization, personal interaction, the setting and the culture of the English village as interpreted in the series.  In particular, the viewer normally faced with the carnage of popular movies and television could find respite with a cerebral journey as Barnaby and Jones unravelled the mystery of the day.  Enter  Season 21 of Midsomer and the gruesome visage of a dismembered body in Echoes of the Dead and giggling,  invasive school girls in Death in the Slow Lane.  Dark Secrets fared a little better but salacious elements,  gratuitous sex and incest, occupied center stage too readily and too much.  I have not viewed The Oblong Murders yet,  so perhaps all is not lost if it contains some saving grace.Ironically, the formidable acting skills of Neil Dudgeon as Chief Inspector John Barnaby and Jason Hughes as Detective Ben Jones are apparent,  but the characters they play are not the Jones of yore or the new Barnaby introduced before the departure of John Nettles.  They are strangers.  They are not the Midsomer inhabitants we have come to know.  The medical examiner, Dr. George Bullard, played by Barry Jackson also suffers character misalignment.  In Series 21 he seems be less inquisitive and now ready to accept any answer.  His rhetorical bantering formerly appreciated by viewers is lost.  The close family unit of Joyce (Jane Wymark), Cully (Laura Howard) and Tom Barnaby (John Nettles) that gave warmth and gentleness in the world of law enforcement and crimes has disappeared.  The caring between John Barnaby and his wife seems real, but it is more visceral than the warm fuzzies of Tom and Joyce and the love of child and parents.I do hope the writers and producers reexamine the best elements of previous Midsomer series and reinstate what made the series so well appreciated by viewers---the caress of the camera on the scenery, the uniqueness of quirky inhabitants, the caring and interaction of the characters, the culture of the village life and the humanity of all.  It was decidedly NOT gratuitous violence and sex, gruesome visuals and intellectual sparsity.LB",3,Is Midsomer becoming CSI?,1358294400,"01 16, 2013",2013,2325,"['Midsomer', 'Murders', 'used', 'provide', 'mystery', 'unravel', 'slow', 'leisurely', 'pace', 'lovely', 'setting', 'English', 'village', 'eccentric', 'inhabitants', 'Murder', 'was', 'propelling', 'force', 'action', 'real', 'focus', 'was', 'characterization', 'personal', 'interaction', 'setting', 'culture', 'English', 'village', 'interpreted', 'series', 'particular', 'viewer', 'normally', 'faced', 'carnage', 'popular', 'movies', 'television', 'could', 'find', 'respite', 'cerebral', 'journey', 'Barnaby', 'Jones', 'unravelled', 'mystery', 'day', 'Enter', 'Season', '21', 'Midsomer', 'gruesome', 'visage', 'dismembered', 'body', 'Echoes', 'Dead', 'giggling', 'invasive', 'school', 'girls', 'Death', 'Slow', 'Lane', 'Dark', 'Secrets', 'fared', 'little', 'better', 'salacious', 'elements', 'gratuitous', 'sex', 'incest', 'occupied', 'center', 'stage', 'too', 'readily', 'too', 'much', 'have', 'not', 'viewed', 'Oblong', 'Murders', 'yet', 'perhaps', 'not', 'lost', 'saving', 'grace.Ironically', 'formidable', 'acting', 'skills', 'Neil', 'Dudgeon', 'Chief', 'Inspector', 'John', 'Barnaby', 'Jason', 'Hughes', 'Detective', 'Ben', 'Jones', 'are', 'apparent', 'characters', 'play', 'are', 'not', 'Jones', 'yore', 'new', 'Barnaby', 'introduced', 'departure', 'John', 'Nettles', 'are', 'strangers', 'are', 'not', 'Midsomer', 'inhabitants', 'have', 'come', 'know', 'medical', 'examiner', 'Dr.', 'George', 'Bullard', 'played', 'Barry', 'Jackson', 'also', 'character', 'misalignment', 'Series', '21', 'be', 'less', 'inquisitive', 'now', 'ready', 'accept', 'answer', 'rhetorical', 'bantering', 'formerly', 'appreciated', 'viewers', 'lost', 'close', 'family', 'unit', 'Joyce', 'Jane', 'Wymark', 'Cully', 'Laura', 'Howard', 'Tom', 'Barnaby', 'John', 'Nettles', 'gave', 'warmth', 'gentleness', 'world', 'law', 'enforcement', 'crimes', 'disappeared', 'caring', 'John', 'Barnaby', 'wife', 'real', 'more', 'visceral', 'warm', 'fuzzies', 'Tom', 'Joyce', 'love', 'child', 'parents.I', 'do', 'hope', 'writers', 'producers', 'reexamine', 'best', 'elements', 'previous', 'Midsomer', 'series', 'reinstate', 'what', 'made', 'series', 'so', 'well', 'appreciated', 'viewers', '-the', 'caress', 'camera', 'scenery', 'uniqueness', 'quirky', 'inhabitants', 'caring', 'interaction', 'characters', 'culture', 'village', 'life', 'humanity', 'was', 'decidedly', 'NOT', 'gratuitous', 'violence', 'sex', 'gruesome', 'visuals', 'intellectual', 'sparsity.LB']",Midsomer Murders - Set 21

The new series, thankfully, does not feature 'blondie' and that is one of the few pluses, however, if you are looking for intricate plots and shocking, eyebrow-raising murders, you should search elsewhere.  Oh, and another yawner is the frequent, but failing attempt to shock the viewer with deviant sexual behavior.  All in all, I suffered through 3 of 4 episodes of series 21 and am ignoring the last, (I am out of patience).

To date, I have viewed all of them and enjoyed all of them, though some were a bit more better than others. They were all interesting in one way of another. This series that follows with cousin DCI John Barnaby does not stand up with the others. DCI John Barnaby is no replacement for DCI Tom Barnaby. The actor that portrays this new DCI is no replacement for John Nettles. I guess the series was going well and they didn't want to let it go just because Nettles left. However, they should have because this series leaves much to be desired now. Sorry, but I can't recommend this series now and won't be viewing anymore of these from now on. Overall, nothing worth viewing here. The episodes run slower now and are lacking. This just isn't Midsomer Murders anymore.",3,"For me, this doesn't do it.
