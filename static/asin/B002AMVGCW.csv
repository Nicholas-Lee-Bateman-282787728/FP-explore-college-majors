I remember some of Gary Shandling's standup from specials I had watched on late night tv. So when I heard Fox was gonna run episodes of this after Married With Children I figured I'd see what the show was about. He didn't seem like the perfect choice for a show, he was hilarious in standup but I wasn't sure how an actual show would pan out. I didn't have cable at the time so it wasn't until Fox started showing it that I got my first glance. Some people I had heard talk about it, said it was hilarious, while others said they just didn't get it. Gary's humor can be a bit dry at times, but he's usually pretty funny. So I decided to find out for myself. I'm glad I did. The sitcom within a sitcom idea was a bit quirky but worked.  Generally, though if you watched the series week to week you would be rewarded with more running jokes/gags. Stuff casual watchers may not pick up on. The only other series I ever watched that got rid of the fourth wall was the Monkees and they were funny too. But, this show picks up on that idea where it left off and pushed it to the limits without really being over the top. The jokes were great, the actors were all in on the joke, and gave great performances. There really isn't much to dislike by the show. If you are a fan of comedy, I mean a true fan you will at least enjoy this show if not love it. Gary's jokes, like I said can be a bit dry, but they are clever and hit the mark every time. Usually when a joke doesn't hit it's intentional and watching the reactions of a bad joke can be just as funny as the really good jokes. I do not understand why anyone would say at $2 an episode it's not worth it. Not because of the show itself but because tv shows can be overpriced. Seeing as this is four seasons, a complete series with extras, I can't really say the price is all that bad. i remember when tv shows came out on dvd for the first time, i was just glad they did and had paid way higher prices than I would pay today. I love a good deal too, but one can't complain too much for what you are getting for the price. Besides, without this show shows like Seinfeld never would have been dreamed of. It's the clever little twists on the classic sitcom genre that sells this show the most, it was very inventive, and has been imitated in many ways since it went off the air, so much that you might think this show isn't all that original, but it is THE original. I would highly reccomend this set at any price. You'll be laughing so much you won't remember how much you paid for it",5,This is the review of Gary's Show,1249430400,"08 5, 2009",2009,2617,"['Obviously', ""n't"", 'out', 'yet', 'review', ""n't"", 'set', 'show', 'remember', 'Gary', 'Shandling', 'standup', 'specials', 'had', 'watched', 'late', 'night', 'tv', 'when', 'heard', 'Fox', 'was', 'gon', 'run', 'episodes', 'Married', 'Children', 'figured', ""'d"", 'see', 'what', 'show', 'was', 'about', 'did', ""n't"", 'seem', 'perfect', 'choice', 'show', 'was', 'hilarious', 'standup', 'was', ""n't"", 'sure', 'how', 'actual', 'show', 'would', 'pan', 'out', 'did', ""n't"", 'have', 'cable', 'time', 'was', ""n't"", 'Fox', 'started', 'showing', 'got', 'first', 'glance', 'people', 'had', 'heard', 'talk', 'said', 'was', 'hilarious', 'others', 'said', 'just', 'did', ""n't"", 'get', 'Gary', 'humor', 'can', 'be', 'bit', 'dry', 'times', 'usually', 'pretty', 'funny', 'decided', 'find', 'out', ""'m"", 'glad', 'did', 'sitcom', 'sitcom', 'idea', 'was', 'bit', 'quirky', 'worked', 'Generally', 'watched', 'series', 'week', 'week', 'would', 'be', 'rewarded', 'more', 'running', 'jokes/gags', 'Stuff', 'casual', 'watchers', 'may', 'not', 'pick', 'up', 'only', 'other', 'series', 'ever', 'watched', 'got', 'rid', 'fourth', 'wall', 'was', 'Monkees', 'were', 'funny', 'too', 'show', 'up', 'idea', 'where', 'left', 'off', 'pushed', 'limits', 'really', 'being', 'top', 'jokes', 'were', 'great', 'actors', 'were', 'joke', 'gave', 'great', 'performances', 'really', ""n't"", 'much', 'dislike', 'show', 'are', 'fan', 'comedy', 'mean', 'true', 'fan', 'will', 'least', 'enjoy', 'show', 'not', 'love', 'Gary', 'jokes', 'said', 'can', 'be', 'bit', 'dry', 'are', 'clever', 'hit', 'mark', 'time', 'Usually', 'when', 'joke', ""n't"", 'hit', 'intentional', 'watching', 'reactions', 'bad', 'joke', 'can', 'be', 'just', 'as', 'funny', 'really', 'good', 'jokes', 'do', 'not', 'understand', 'why', 'anyone', 'would', 'say', '2', 'episode', 'not', 'worth', 'Not', 'show', 'tv', 'shows', 'can', 'be', 'overpriced', 'Seeing', 'four', 'seasons', 'complete', 'series', 'extras', 'ca', ""n't"", 'really', 'say', 'price', 'bad', 'i', 'remember', 'when', 'tv', 'shows', 'came', 'out', 'dvd', 'first', 'time', 'i', 'was', 'just', 'glad', 'did', 'had', 'paid', 'way', 'higher', 'prices', 'would', 'pay', 'today', 'love', 'good', 'deal', 'too', 'one', 'ca', ""n't"", 'complain', 'too', 'much', 'what', 'are', 'getting', 'price', 'show', 'Seinfeld', 'never', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'dreamed', 'clever', 'little', 'twists', 'classic', 'sitcom', 'genre', 'show', 'most', 'was', 'very', 'inventive', 'been', 'imitated', 'many', 'ways', 'went', 'air', 'so', 'much', 'might', 'think', 'show', ""n't"", 'original', 'original', 'would', 'highly', 'reccomend', 'set', 'price', ""'ll"", 'be', 'laughing', 'so', 'much', 'wo', ""n't"", 'remember', 'how', 'much', 'paid']",It's Garry Shandling's Show: The Complete Series

Here's the facts:1) This is a 16 disc complete set loaded with brand new extras.2) It's from Shout! Factory who always produce high quality box sets.3) It retains all the guest stars and music.  For every guest star that walks into Garry's home, the producers of this set have to negotiate with them or their estate.  This costs a lot of money.  Now they could have gone the inexpensive way and eliminated scenes, certain music, even entire episodes.  But they didn't.4) It's a landmark cult TV series that probably wouldn't be seeing the light of day if not for the folks at Shout! Factory.I agree that it is a lot to shell out.  But as a fan who has very fond memories of this blowing my mind 20+ years ago, it's a small price to pay to have the the entire complete series in one big box with Shandling's participation.  This set is certainly a specialty item and not one to appeal to a mainstream audience.  It's aimed at the serious collector of the offbeat and unusual.With all that in mind I'm looking forward to this set and have no problem shelling out around $100 to show my support for this wonderfully creative show.

Decided to watch a couple of episodes (didn't even know this show existed) to see if it was worth keeping. Watched episode #1 & it seems pretty lame, but will watch a couple more just to make sure. Something that is extremely annoying is the loud, wild cheering & laughter from the audience after every Garry Shandling comment. He'll say something that isn't even remotely funny & the crowd will roar with laughter. I'm not sure how much more of that I can listen to. I'm giving it 2 stars, 1 for the nice packaging and another for sort of tricking me into buying it.Jan. 8th, 2010:Watched entire disk 1 & quickly realized I've just wasted 3 hours of my life that I'll never get back. To put it bluntly the show is horrible. Not even mildly amusing. Maybe Gary mugging into the camera 15 times a show was groundbreaking in the 80's (the studio audience sure seemed to think so with their constant wild laughter)but it sure seems lame 25 years later.  Now, I'm sure there are people out there that might like this show but then again there are people out there that enjoy ""professional"" wrestling, daytime talk TV shows & spending weekends with their mother-in-law. Typically I am the type of person that never returns anything I buy no matter how useless it turns out to be...but this one is going back.

At the time I was avoiding anything that smacked of ""appointment television"" so I never followed it, but things stuck in my mind for years - in particular, I caught the episode where garry turns on his own show on TV (which is live footage of him watching himself watching himself) and quickly proclaims ""It's just a guy watching TV - who wants to watch that?....Oh, that's me!"" - the sheer meta-ness of that stuck with me.  So I welcomed the chance to see the show from the beginning.These DVDs are superbly produced and packaged, picture and sound are clear and there are interesting extras (though I'd have loved more - where is the 25th Anniversary Special, the bridge to the Larry Sanders show?).That said, I do think the price is a bit high.  It's a fun show, but not always great - some episodes are kind of flat and I winder if I'll go back and watch many of them a second or third time.  In contrast, I'd gladly pay these prices for Larry Sanders, but that show was much more densely packed and stands up much better to repeated viewings.Bottom line:  The show is well worth seeing and these DVDs are superbly produced, but as an investment I think it's really for die-hard fans until/unless the price drops.",4,I love this quirky show,1263427200,"01 14, 2010",2010,1306,"['caught', 'few', 'fleeting', 'glimpses', 'show', 'reruns', 'broadcast', 'TV', 'many', 'years', 'ago', 'time', 'was', 'avoiding', 'anything', 'smacked', 'appointment', 'television', 'so', 'never', 'followed', 'things', 'stuck', 'mind', 'years', 'particular', 'caught', 'episode', 'where', 'garry', 'own', 'show', 'TV', 'live', 'footage', 'watching', 'watching', 'quickly', 'just', 'guy', 'watching', 'TV', 'who', 'watch', '.Oh', 'sheer', 'meta-ness', 'stuck', 'So', 'welcomed', 'chance', 'see', 'show', 'beginning.These', 'DVDs', 'are', 'superbly', 'produced', 'packaged', 'picture', 'sound', 'are', 'clear', 'are', 'interesting', 'extras', ""'d"", 'have', 'loved', 'more', 'where', '25th', 'Anniversary', 'Special', 'bridge', 'Larry', 'Sanders', 'show', 'said', 'do', 'think', 'price', 'bit', 'high', 'fun', 'show', 'not', 'always', 'great', 'episodes', 'are', 'kind', 'flat', 'winder', ""'ll"", 'go', 'back', 'watch', 'many', 'second', 'third', 'time', 'contrast', ""'d"", 'gladly', 'pay', 'prices', 'Larry', 'Sanders', 'show', 'was', 'much', 'more', 'densely', 'packed', 'up', 'much', 'better', 'repeated', 'viewings.Bottom', 'line', 'show', 'well', 'worth', 'seeing', 'DVDs', 'are', 'superbly', 'produced', 'investment', 'think', 'really', 'die-hard', 'fans', 'price', 'drops']",It's Garry Shandling's Show: The Complete Series
