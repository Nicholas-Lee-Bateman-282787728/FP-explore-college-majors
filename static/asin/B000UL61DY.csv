1095294,A3AD071UEP20WS,B000UL61DY,"Roger Long ""longrush""","[3, 3]","If you are a baseball fan and especially if you are a New York Yankees fan, this is an informative collection of biographies--and baseball history.  It starts with Ruth and Gehrig and comes up to the present.  Each program is about an hour long.Most hard-core fans already know about the early greats, and those programs are fine, but it gets better with the pieces about Berra, Mantle, Ford, etc., because there are more clips of their great moments.  The bio of legendary Yogi alone is worth it all.  His son tells that Yogi once called a pizza parlor and asked for a medium pizza.  ""You want that cut in 8 slices or 4?"" Yogi was asked.  ""Better make it 4,"" was the reply.  ""I don't think I can eat 8.""There are fine clips of Mantle launching spectacular home runs, Ford on the mound, Yogi hitting homers on pitches out of the strike zone.This is well done and a treasure for the fan.",5,Great baseball item,1274054400,"05 17, 2010",2010,886,"['are', 'baseball', 'fan', 'especially', 'are', 'New', 'York', 'Yankees', 'fan', 'informative', 'collection', 'biographies', 'baseball', 'history', 'Ruth', 'Gehrig', 'up', 'present', 'program', 'hour', 'long.Most', 'hard-core', 'fans', 'already', 'know', 'early', 'greats', 'programs', 'are', 'fine', 'better', 'pieces', 'Berra', 'Mantle', 'Ford', 'etc.', 'are', 'more', 'clips', 'great', 'moments', 'bio', 'legendary', 'Yogi', 'alone', 'son', 'Yogi', 'once', 'called', 'pizza', 'parlor', 'asked', 'medium', 'pizza', 'want', 'cut', '8', 'slices', '4', 'Yogi', 'was', 'asked', 'Better', 'make', '4', 'was', 'reply', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'can', 'eat', '8', 'are', 'fine', 'clips', 'Mantle', 'launching', 'spectacular', 'home', 'runs', 'Ford', 'mound', 'Yogi', 'hitting', 'homers', 'pitches', 'strike', 'zone.This', 'well', 'done', 'treasure', 'fan']",Yankeeography Megaset

The people at the YES network have put together a collection that is nothing short of classic baseball history.  My favorites were the segments featuring the old-timers, particularly since they contain a lot of vintage footage that I'd never before seen. I hope someone at MLB is watching the success of this DVD and will create a similar collection featuring many more great players (and managers) from other teams.",5,Very Nice Collection,1210982400,"05 17, 2008",2008,491,"[""'m"", 'not', 'even', 'Yankee', 'fan', 'thoroughly', 'enjoyed', 'watching', 'series', 'people', 'YES', 'network', 'have', 'put', 'together', 'collection', 'nothing', 'short', 'classic', 'baseball', 'history', 'favorites', 'were', 'segments', 'featuring', 'old-timers', 'particularly', 'contain', 'lot', 'vintage', 'footage', ""'d"", 'never', 'before', 'seen', 'hope', 'someone', 'MLB', 'watching', 'success', 'DVD', 'will', 'create', 'similar', 'collection', 'featuring', 'many', 'more', 'great', 'players', 'managers', 'other', 'teams']",Yankeeography Megaset
