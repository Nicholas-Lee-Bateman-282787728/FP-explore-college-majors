She had been living her dream to work with and around penguins ever since she was a stand in for the Mrs Howell on ""Gilligan's Island.""For her birthday, I purchased this movie in hopes that it would of been the perfect gift.However, she did not have a blu-ray player, so I had to work a few extra shifts at Krystal (steamed square burgers on white rolls) to afford a used blu-ray player from the pawn shop.After seeing the movie, she became physically sick. She ended up having to quite her job because she was no longer covered by their insurance with the hopes that Obamacare would take ""care"" of her.  Obamacare wasn't taking care of her so she moved to Italy for better health care.Working in the nautical industry did not prepare her as much as she had hoped. After the all male freight ship crew discovered her ""skills,"" she was quickly put to task keeping them happy. No one was ever quite sure what that entailed.Unfortunately, the care was little more than a pain pill and she passed away on the way home from the public health clinic there.This movie has broken our home by being the cause of my grandmother's death.",1,Worst animated movie(s) ever,1361664000,"02 24, 2013",2013,1203,"['grandmother', 'was', 'tour', 'guide', 'penguin', 'exhibit', 'Sea', 'World', 'Florida', 'had', 'been', 'living', 'dream', 'work', 'penguins', 'ever', 'was', 'stand', 'Mrs', 'Howell', 'Gilligan', 'Island', 'birthday', 'purchased', 'movie', 'hopes', 'would', 'been', 'perfect', 'gift.However', 'did', 'not', 'have', 'blu-ray', 'player', 'had', 'work', 'few', 'extra', 'shifts', 'Krystal', 'steamed', 'square', 'burgers', 'white', 'rolls', 'afford', 'used', 'blu-ray', 'player', 'pawn', 'shop.After', 'seeing', 'movie', 'became', 'physically', 'sick', 'ended', 'up', 'having', 'quite', 'job', 'was', 'no', 'longer', 'covered', 'insurance', 'hopes', 'Obamacare', 'would', 'take', 'care', 'Obamacare', 'was', ""n't"", 'taking', 'care', 'moved', 'Italy', 'better', 'health', 'care.Working', 'nautical', 'industry', 'did', 'not', 'prepare', 'as', 'much', 'had', 'hoped', 'male', 'freight', 'ship', 'crew', 'discovered', 'skills', 'was', 'quickly', 'put', 'task', 'keeping', 'happy', 'one', 'was', 'ever', 'quite', 'sure', 'what', 'entailed.Unfortunately', 'care', 'was', 'little', 'more', 'pain', 'pill', 'passed', 'away', 'way', 'home', 'public', 'health', 'clinic', 'there.This', 'movie', 'broken', 'home', 'being', 'cause', 'grandmother', 'death']",N/A
