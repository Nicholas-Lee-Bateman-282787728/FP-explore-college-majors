Even worse fares Season 2 which is missing 14 of its original 31 episodes.The other annoying thing is that, except for the first 9 episodes, most of the others do not appear in the original order and are put together haphazardly.I would have loved to own the whole series or at least a complete season or more, but this unorganized mixture does not do it for me.TOO BAD!The above was written before I decided to order the boxes in spite of their shortcomings.  It was a mistake.  The picture quality is atrocious, worse than most of my old videos taped from TV.  It was a complete waste of money.  I should have followed my instinct and left it alone.Originally I had given 3 stars, but I have to take away 1 for appearance.

1530248,A1SDPA1J98UP4L,B007FDTAKG,"THE AUTISTIC WEREWOLF ""Wolf""","[0, 0]","I loved the Ben Casey TV Series but this particular release has to be bootleg or else studios put out anything.  I remember when Ben Casey was in returns in the 1960's and the prints were better than this.  Some of the video is ok in other episodes the video is perfectly horrible.  Its like watching ghosts portraying people. Honestly I paid far more than this set is worth. If you can catch this on sale for $5.00 it still is not a great deal in quality BUT its better than nothing which is the only reason I brought these incomplete sets.  Logic suggests the complete seasons were not included because they were not fully available or were in such bad shape they would not sell.Growing up autistic with 13 disabilities back in the 1960's I saw my fill of hospitals. In my early youth I went to the clinic every two weeks. I saw old people dying.  I saw convicts led into the basement of the old clinic building in leg irons, shackles. I saw male prisoners trussed up like a Christmas goose.  Many times I'd have to stay home from school due to illness or suspension due to behavior issues. I'd get to see reruns of Ben Casey.  Another reviewer states ""Do not buy these Ben Casey DVD's they look as if they were taken from bad quality video tape!""  Well that reviewer is half right. The medium from which these Ben Casey DVD's was copied looks watchable but bad.  Sure this Ben Casey series need remastering. With a quality redo this Ben Casey Series would be in extra fine condition worthy of any collection.However you are not guranteed a redo of these Ben Casey DVD's in perfect quality remastered glory. I have learned things collecting DVD's and I have well over 10,000 DVD's now. I've learned sometimes you better strike while a print is available because; it may be gone forever once out of print. The DVD as a video format has its days numbered. Oh you can always buy DVD's on the secondary market especially here at Amazon.com where the used DVD market thrives like nowhere else. Question do you really want to pay $75 for an out of print Ben Casey when you could have it now for $22.Anyways that say Bem Casey was another networks answer to Dr. Kildare except Ben Casey was a more grim version of the big city medical center show. Patients died on Ben Casey with alarming regularity. Doctor Zorba always looked like the perfect stereotype of a mad scientist.  I remember asking my great grandmother why do they let that crazy man roam the halls free like that.  I said to my great grandmother I thought you said they locked crazy people away for their own good. Doctor Zorba always looked mad as a hatter. Ben Casey was more of a grim brooding character he was not the fresh faced eager all american boy Dr. Kildare so obviously was. Ben Casey often reminded me of Atlas a man who walked through life with the weight of the world on his shoulders. Truth be told Ben Casey had ever right to be grim since death clung to him like a brother feasting, growing fat on all his patients. Death clung to Ben Casey's hospital like a second skin.Like Dr. Kildare if you know anything at all about medicine you will hear treatments prescribed that would land you in a malpractice lawsuit were it tried today. You will be subject to the most politically incorrect ideals oh yes they left all the good stuff in as should be the case. Let insensitive voices and actions from our collective past speak clearly without the fetters political correctness would enforce upon them. Ben Casey's hospital was another grim dark featureless dungeon like inatitutional building. The patients in Ben Casey's world were generally well developed characters that you cared about before they often died.  I saw so many people die on Ben casey that one time while my grandmother and I were waiting for one of my many clinic appointment doctors to see me I asked. Why do people come here to die? My grandmother tried to shush me but Autistic kids are clueless about social nicecities. Finally realizing I would get no answer to that question I eventually asked the next question on my roster.  I asked my grandmother Am I going to die, is that why I am here.  My grandmother tried her best to assure me I was not at the clinic because; I was dying.I remember saying to my grandmother in defiance knowing I was right, That can't be true I said everyone who goes to Ben Caseys hospital dies. I was so focused on death at hospitals because; my biological mother died at a local hospital when I was but four years old going on five. Yet I watched Ben Casey every chance I got and loved it.  As an autistic kid I also loved elevators and I used to watch the show to see how accurate and real the elevators were.  Generally speaking despite the millions poured into special effects Hollywood makes the most childish unbelievable elevators back then and even today.  But anyway I loved Ben Casey because; it had an almost Addams family gloom to it.  I would not be at all surpized if the Hospital where Ben Casey practiced had a permanent black cloud hanging over it.Dr. Kildare was a nice guy from a good well to do family Ben Casey seemed like he was born of the hardened city streets and humble beginnings. Ben Casey seemed like the kind of doctor who fought and scratched his way to the top by virtue of sheer willpower, skills and blessings alone.  Despite Ben Casey and Dr. Kildare both being medical shows from the same era they are in fact both very different.  Not as hip and socially adventures as Dr. Joe Gannon and his Medical Center's plots 5 or so years later but for their time interesting stories and moral dillemmas.  I give it five stars because; these DVD's while not perfect exist and I'd rather a bird in the hand than nothing at all \ or buying these same DVD's for a fortune after letting this opportunity slip away.  I brought my copies now.On collecting items I leave you with this. Once upon a time Amazon.com had Eagle Transporters for sale @ $49.00 or so.  The Eagle Transporter was an all purpose spaceship that was part of a 1970's era sci fi show called Space: 1999. $49.00 dollars is a LOT of my hard earned money for a 12 inch collection of metal and plastic so I almost said forget it I'll wait till it is available on the used after sales market. Fortunately my desire to have these Space: 1999 Eagle Transporter space ships won out and I purchased 10 of them at $48.00 each. Today the same Eagle Transporters I brought are on offer in the Amazon.com marketplace for $399.00 each.  Not everything will appreciate in value like this BUT, you buy what you like when the price is relatively cheap. Collecting is not about trying to buy what will appreciate, true collecting is all about buying what you like.",2,BEN CASEY HE WORKED AT A HOSPITAL WHERE PATIENTS WERE DYING TO SEE HIM!
