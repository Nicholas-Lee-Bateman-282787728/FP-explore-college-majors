Although I like Alec, he's great and funny on SNL shows, as a movie actor... well... he's really stinks!. In this film, I guess they tried to make an experiment throwing him with our beloved Meryl and our great comedian Martin. The hope was, I guess, that with the plenty talent of the last two, the shortcomings of Alec would be less noticeable. But... it did not work... Somehow I felt Meryl was holding back on her acting, as if she was making tremendous efforts not letting us see that natural shine she's got, and that we are so used to see. I had to struggle to watch the movie to the end. Alec made me feel embarrassed, his acting was really bad, not funny at all... I actually felt pity for him. Those funny sketches he plays so well at NBC shows, have nothing to do with movie making, and much less when you have to act with actors of extraordinary talent like the other super stars in this movie. We love you Alec, and we love to see you in TV sitcoms. But just the movie screen requires a whole different type of character than what you can offer. If they want to save Alec's career, have him started his own comedy show, or talk show, something... for TV.

1291714,A24PTVSZSM8968,B002VECM1S,Amazon Customer,"[0, 0]","I would say this is one of the more difficult movies to classify. It tries to be a number of things. On the one hand, it tries to be a serious movie about relationships, in this case divorce and its aftermath. It also tries to be a bit more of a lighthearted movie with some funny scenes. Finally, it tries to be a romantic movie in which a person in a bad relationship has a few close calls with someone better before finally ending up with that person.This is the story of a woman who has been divorced for 10 years and is finally starting to put her life back on track although she admits to some feelings of loneliness when with friends. Early in the movie, she finds herself alone at a hotel restaurant with her ex-husband who is now married to a younger woman with an annoying child. Her ex-husband convinces her to have dinner and after a good deal of wine and a some fun they end up having a romantic tryst. Back home, her ex-husband continues to pursue a re-kindling of their relationship which leads to a number of complicated scenes and situations, including problems with the woman's new boyfriend. In the end, after a number of twists and turns, she ends up with the new guy.The acting in this movie is pretty good. Meryl Streep and Alec Baldwin do a pretty decent job with their parts and Steve Martin makes for a convincing Mr. nice guy as the new boyfriend. The ex-couple's children turn in a somewhat less convincing performance, but they have relatively minor parts. I'm giving the movie 4 stars and not 5 because I wasn't sure to laugh cry or cringe as the tone of the movie changed various times.

1291716,ANCOMAI0I7LVG,B002VECM1S,Andrew Ellington,"[1, 1]","There is a moment towards the very beginning of `It's Complicated' where Jane, Meryl Streep's character, is talking with her two daughters and her son-in-law.  It's the first time where you meet her children and their repartee with one another was so disgustingly rehearsed that I turned to my wife and said ""they must be the most annoying family I've ever seen"".  Thankfully, the children are not a major part of this movie, because I hated them.  I mean, I seriously thought about punching my television screen every time John Krasinski was on it (and she doesn't even play BLOOD, but god he tries so hard to be `cute' it made me sick).But forget the children, because the bulk of this movie is all about Meryl `goddess' Streep, Steve `funny-man' Martin and Alec `my newfound obsession' Baldwin, and by GOD do they rock this movie!So the film tells the story of Jane who was once married to Jake before he left her for a younger woman, the `stank faced' Agness.  Jane and Jake have a seemingly well-adjusted relationship where they can be in the same room and reminisce and basically act like adults.  Jake is obviously unhappy in his current marriage, and he starts to `miss' what he left all those years ago.  After a drunken night of surprising `activities', both Jake and Jane begin a torrid affair with each other.  The problem is that while Jane is frolicking with her ex-husband, another man, the lonely divorced Adam, is courting her.Streep, Martin and Baldwin are all at the top of their game here.  It saddens me that everyone went crazy for Streep's Julia Child mimicry back in 2009, when her more carefree portrayal of Jane is far more complex and likable.  Martin isn't in a lot of the movie, but his brand of physical humor is used perfectly (especially in that `high' scene).  But this is Baldwin's movie.  His portrayal of Jake is flawless, right down to the baritone vocals, the perverted flourishes and the emotional frustrations.  He just steals every single scene.I'm glad the kids are an afterthought, because I wanted to turn the movie off when I was introduced to them, but the `grownups' make this a pleasurable experience.  Nancy Meyers has a history of overstaying her welcome (both `Something's Gotta Give' and `The Holiday' were just WAY TOO LONG), but `It's Complicated' is probably her best flowing film, for it doesn't feel drawn out at all.This is so much better than I expected it to be!",4,What's complicated about `SIT DOWN AND WATCH THIS MOVIE'?,1338422400,"05 31, 2012",2012,2422,"['moment', 'very', 'beginning', 'Complicated', 'where', 'Jane', 'Meryl', 'Streep', 'character', 'talking', 'two', 'daughters', 'son-in-law', 'first', 'time', 'where', 'meet', 'children', 'repartee', 'one', 'was', 'so', 'disgustingly', 'rehearsed', 'turned', 'wife', 'said', 'must', 'be', 'most', 'annoying', 'family', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'seen', 'Thankfully', 'children', 'are', 'not', 'major', 'part', 'movie', 'hated', 'mean', 'seriously', 'thought', 'punching', 'television', 'screen', 'time', 'John', 'Krasinski', 'was', ""n't"", 'even', 'play', 'BLOOD', 'so', 'hard', 'be', 'cute', 'made', 'sick', '.But', 'forget', 'children', 'bulk', 'movie', 'Meryl', 'goddess', 'Streep', 'Steve', 'funny-man', 'Martin', 'Alec', 'newfound', 'obsession', 'Baldwin', 'GOD', 'do', 'rock', 'movie', 'film', 'story', 'Jane', 'who', 'was', 'once', 'married', 'Jake', 'left', 'younger', 'woman', 'stank', 'faced', 'Agness', 'Jane', 'Jake', 'have', 'seemingly', 'well-adjusted', 'relationship', 'where', 'can', 'be', 'same', 'room', 'reminisce', 'basically', 'act', 'adults', 'Jake', 'obviously', 'unhappy', 'current', 'marriage', 'miss', 'what', 'left', 'years', 'ago', 'drunken', 'night', 'surprising', 'activities', 'Jake', 'Jane', 'begin', 'torrid', 'affair', 'other', 'problem', 'Jane', 'frolicking', 'ex-husband', 'man', 'lonely', 'divorced', 'Adam', 'courting', 'her.Streep', 'Martin', 'Baldwin', 'are', 'top', 'game', 'here', 'everyone', 'went', 'crazy', 'Streep', 'Julia', 'Child', 'mimicry', 'back', '2009', 'when', 'more', 'carefree', 'portrayal', 'Jane', 'far', 'more', 'complex', 'likable', 'Martin', ""n't"", 'lot', 'movie', 'brand', 'physical', 'humor', 'used', 'perfectly', 'especially', 'high', 'scene', 'Baldwin', 'movie', 'portrayal', 'Jake', 'flawless', 'right', 'down', 'baritone', 'vocals', 'perverted', 'flourishes', 'emotional', 'frustrations', 'just', 'steals', 'single', 'scene.I', ""'m"", 'glad', 'kids', 'are', 'afterthought', 'wanted', 'turn', 'movie', 'when', 'was', 'introduced', 'grownups', 'make', 'pleasurable', 'experience', 'Nancy', 'Meyers', 'history', 'overstaying', 'welcome', 'Something', 'Got', 'ta', 'Give', 'Holiday', 'were', 'just', 'WAY', 'TOO', 'LONG', 'Complicated', 'probably', 'best', 'flowing', 'film', ""n't"", 'feel', 'drawn', 'out', 'all.This', 'so', 'much', 'better', 'expected', 'be']",N/A

While ""It's Complicated"" may not rank as the finest film in either woman's career, in a year of overblown sequels and overwrought dramas, it is a breath of fresh air, and is certainly one of my favorite films of 2010.The plot is something many of us can understand...years after a divorce, the ex-wife (Streep), facing an 'empty nest' as the last of her children leaves home, is seduced, casually, at first, by her ex-husband (Alec Baldwin, an old pro at combining smarmy and sincere). Because she's vulnerable, she 'gives in', despite the fact that the break-up put her into therapy, and he's been married for 10 years to the 'hot' younger woman (Lake Bell), he dumped her for. She knows their 'fling' is wrong, and she has met a really wonderful guy who likes her (Steve Martin, fabulous in a surprisingly subdued performance), but the ex-husband feels so good having his 'secret affair', he begins aggressively pursuing her. Back in Hollywood's 'Golden Age', we might have rooted for Baldwin and Streep to reconcile (consider ""The Philadelphia Story"" and it's musical clone, ""High Society""), but Meyers understands today's far more complex issues, and, with kindness and humor, explores the impact of the couple's actions on Streep's children, her friends, and even Martin (in a wild laptop sequence). The resolution is very satisfying, I'm happy to say!The supporting cast is first-rate (as in all of Nancy Meyers' films), especially the adult children (Hunter Parrish, Caitlin Fitzgerald, and Zoe Kazan), and Streep's son-in-law-to-be (the scene-stealing John Krasinski). And the women of the film are a 'Who's Who' of terrific veteran actresses (including Rita Wilson, Mary Kay Place, and Nora Dunn).As for Meryl Streep...the older she gets, the more beautiful, sensual, and funny she becomes...She's worth the love of both men, and more!""It's Complicated"" is great fun...Thanks, Nancy Meyers!!",5,"Nancy Meyers, Meryl Streep, and a Witty Script!",1280361600,"07 29, 2010",2010,2212,"['Maybe', ""'m"", 'aging', 'Babyboomer', 'love', 'directorial', 'work', 'Nancy', 'Meyers', 'who', 'generation', 'better', 'nearly', 'anybody', 'when', 'wonderfully', 'wise', 'comedy', 'teamed', 'America', 'finest', 'actress', 'Meryl', 'Streep', 'have', 'potential', 'something', 'really', 'special', 'Complicated', 'may', 'not', 'rank', 'finest', 'film', 'woman', 'career', 'year', 'overblown', 'sequels', 'overwrought', 'dramas', 'breath', 'fresh', 'air', 'certainly', 'one', 'favorite', 'films', '2010.The', 'plot', 'something', 'many', 'can', 'understand', 'years', 'divorce', 'ex-wife', 'Streep', 'facing', ""'empty"", 'nest', 'last', 'children', 'home', 'seduced', 'casually', 'first', 'ex-husband', 'Alec', 'Baldwin', 'old', 'pro', 'combining', 'smarmy', 'sincere', 'vulnerable', 'fact', 'break-up', 'put', 'therapy', 'been', 'married', '10', 'years', ""'hot"", 'younger', 'woman', 'Lake', 'Bell', 'dumped', ""'fling"", 'wrong', 'met', 'really', 'wonderful', 'guy', 'who', 'Steve', 'Martin', 'fabulous', 'surprisingly', 'subdued', 'performance', 'ex-husband', 'feels', 'so', 'good', 'having', ""'secret"", 'affair', 'aggressively', 'pursuing', 'Back', 'Hollywood', ""'Golden"", 'Age', 'might', 'have', 'rooted', 'Baldwin', 'Streep', 'reconcile', 'consider', 'Philadelphia', 'Story', 'musical', 'clone', 'High', 'Society', 'Meyers', 'today', 'far', 'more', 'complex', 'issues', 'kindness', 'humor', 'impact', 'couple', 'actions', 'Streep', 'children', 'friends', 'even', 'Martin', 'wild', 'laptop', 'sequence', 'resolution', 'very', 'satisfying', ""'m"", 'happy', 'say', 'supporting', 'cast', 'first-rate', 'Nancy', 'Meyers', 'films', 'especially', 'adult', 'children', 'Hunter', 'Parrish', 'Caitlin', 'Fitzgerald', 'Zoe', 'Kazan', 'Streep', 'son-in-law-to-be', 'scene-stealing', 'John', 'Krasinski', 'women', 'film', 'are', ""'Who"", 'Who', ""'"", 'terrific', 'veteran', 'actresses', 'including', 'Rita', 'Wilson', 'Mary', 'Kay', 'Place', 'Nora', 'Dunn', '.As', 'Meryl', 'Streep', 'older', 'more', 'beautiful', 'sensual', 'funny', 'love', 'men', 'more', 'Complicated', 'great', 'fun', 'Thanks', 'Nancy', 'Meyers']",N/A

I also loved that I really could not predict how it all ended.I was surprised by Steve Martin's performance in this movie. He's always played the nice dad who loves his kids.  He still was a 'nice guy' but he wasn't a dad who coached the football team or drove a mini-van but he was just a handsome architect who was pursuing a woman.

It is very funny in parts and overall I really enjoyed it.  Be warned though, there are some moments for the romantics in the audience that may not go over.  The stand out performance was Baldwin's as he had to do most of the laugh out loud funny stuff.  Then in a rapid about face, he had to get deadly serious.  I thought it was one of his very best film roles.  No one really knew he was a comic actor before 30 ROCK but he sure is.  There is one scene where he is posing in front of an Apple laptop in the nude without knowing that it is linked to Streep's new boyfriend, Martin, as they were having a video call with one another before she went to the bathroom. This is utterly hilarious.  His giving a sperm sample at the fertility clinic is pretty good too.  Streep was very good, as always, but I can't say she was as funny as Baldwin.  However, she was an excellent foil for him. Plus it is a boon for women that a plus 60 actress got to play this role.  Martin is really in a very small role here.  His funniest moment is when he listening to a divorce self help tape in his car and then we find out he's been divorced over 3 years!  He really plays a nerd most of the time though, a very nice nerd but certainly not the hilarious guy we know he can be, or the deadly serious one either.

Its title may be It's Complicated, but there is nothing complicated in regards to the elements that make the film terrific. For starters it stars three of the most gifted actors working today: Meryl Streep, Alec Baldwin and Steve Martin. And for seconds, it's written and directed by none other than, Nancy Myers. Having previously brought us such flawless delights as Something's Gotta Give, The Holiday and What Women Want, Myers is without a doubt the Spielberg of the rom-com (romantic comedy).What I love most about Myers is, she writes her films from the heart and then directs them from the same place. According to her DVD audio commentaries, she traditionally writes from what she has experienced in real life; and it translates beautifully in her work.Meryl Streep stars as a middle-aged divorced mother named Jane Adler. Alec Baldwin plays her ex-husband Jake and he does it so well, you wonder if he and Jake are more similar than you'd like to think (hopefully he's just that good of an actor!).Jake's a slime-ball but he's an attractive and charming slime-ball. This makes it easy for us to buy that he can convince his ex-wife to have an affair with him while they are in town for their son's college graduation. Trust me, the excessive alcohol he buys her plays its part in setting this into motion, which also drives the film forward. And we have a soft chuckle at the realization that the sex may have been a tad bit better for Jake, than it was for our girl!Jake is the overly-used clich&eacute; in films and in life, of a married man who steps out on his wife without the slightest bit of remorse for doing so. But Baldwin offers this all too familiar villain a fresh and wickedly funny persona that we have seldom seen in similar characters before. Slimy or not, you just can't help but like the guy. Second only to The Edge, this is my favorite performance of Baldwin's, and he's delivered a whole slew good ones.We are able to forgive our leading lady Jane for sleeping with a married man, because his wife (Lake Bell) is not only a bitch, but Jake in fact left Jane to be with her after sowing his oats in her basket on the side, several years ago. I'm not saying this is a good thing, I'm just saying it allows us to still root for Jane; mistress to a married man or not! If that doesn't have you convinced, then surely the superbly hilarious delivery of Streep's one-liner to her gal pals will: ""Turns out... I'm a bit of a slut!""The film needs not establish the relationship of Jane and Jake for us, because it is already there. They were married for years, they have several kids together, and both of their performances have us undoubtedly believing these characters from the very first scene.This allows time for the relationship between Steve Martin's character Adam, and Jane to grow and keep us invested there. Now we have a romance stewing between Jane and Adam, who is the guy we know she should really be with; and the jealousy of Jake when he isn't able to give Jane as much time as Adam, as he has to be home for dinner with the wife! Baldwin plays jealously remarkably well also, and he throws in a bit of immaturely to it to boot!Adam is an architect who has been hired on by Jane to help her design an extension to her already massive home. It can be argued that this is a tad bit ridiculous as Jane lives alone in the already huge house, and probably wouldn't be able to afford such an improvement with her job as a professional baker, but the film doesn't dwell on it, nor does it make a cheesy mess out of it.Nancy Myers is an expert when it comes to meet-cutes (the point in a film where two central characters meet; see a detailed explanation in The Holiday) in her films, and this is not only that, but also a subtext of what Jane and Adam's relationship is; Jane is in need of a makeover in her love life, and Adam is the architect that will build that for her - got it? I thought so.There are a ton of laughs to be found in this film, particularly those where Martin and Baldwin share the screen. Baldwin's face kills me every time (as I've seen the movie numerous times now), when he glares at the two of them from across the room at a party, realizing that he may have a history with Jane, but this new guy is just that - new, and has never hurt her. You can match the laugh there, with Steve Martin's portrayal of a guy who is high at the same party, and trying to not make it so obvious. When Jake approaches him and Jane, Adam mutters to her with classic Steve Martin poise, ""Not a good time to be feelin' groovy!""In addition to the outlandish laughter, there are also scenes of perfected cinematic romance between Jane and both men. The scene with Jane and Jake in the bathroom, and the one between her and Adam at the bakery, were my most prized moments of these.There are some very big and well done side performances by talented actors too. These are cleverly written and directed by Myers as always, and are constantly playing off of the comedy in all three acts wonderfully. Watch for the scenes with Jane's son-in-law (John Krasinski) when he catches onto her affair with Jake and can't tell anyone.This is the kind of writing that inspires writers to be writers. The film is filled with little moments like these, as are Nancy Myers' other films.",5,It's Complicated Review,1293494400,"12 28, 2010",2010,5584,"['IT', 'COMPLICATEDSTARRING', 'Meryl', 'Streep',

1291758,A3EXWV8FNSSFL6,B002VECM1S,Daniel G. Lebryk,"[0, 0]","Eric Baldwin is a pig, Meryl Streep is gorgeous and natural, and Steve Martin is a sad geek. This is a very funny, wonderful, mindless comedy. The three stars carry this film, Jim Krasinski is the only decent supporting cast member; the rest could all be throw aways.Meryl Streep and Alec Balwin have been divorced 10 years. They are at a friend's 30 anniversary party (they would have celebrated the same anniversary). The conflict is set up when Alec's young nubile wife shows up and takes Alec away. Steve Martin is the architect building an addition for the very particular Meryl Streep. Alec and Meryl end up in bed together during their son's college graduation. Steve wants to date Meryl. The story is not terribly complex; it's the comedy of how this coupling happens that makes the film interesting. The trailers really don't give much away.You'll notice that I have used the actor's names. My complaint with the film is that I never really got to know these three as characters in the film. Their stardom really overshadowed their screen characters. Yes, Meryl is Jan, Alec is Jake, and Steve is Adam; but after the film I thought of only their real names.There's a very sad state of affairs with the MPAA right now. They've made some incredible strides with PG-13 in loosening up what is PG-13 and not R. They've become a bit less political in the past year since Jack Valenti has passed away. But this film is really ridiculous in that R rating came because of marijuana smoking with no legal consequences. There are incredibly violent films that show gore beyond imagination, but that is acceptable. Two people smoke an herbal cigarette, get really happy, and don't get arrested is not acceptable, making it an R rated film? That we can see a very clear side view of Hayden Panteirre's breast and senseless beatings in I Love You Beth Cooper and get a PG-13, there just seems to be no intelligence in the ratings. So It's Complicated is rated R, probably doesn't deserve the rating. Aside from the drug use and alcohol consumption, there's no full frontal nudity (although we get a very clear view of Alec Baldwin's stunt double's naked rear end). There is implied sexual activity, never showing anything intimate. So aside from the herbal cigarette scene, this is a pretty begnign film. I would say younger mature viewers could watch this film.The big but in the audience, this is really a film geared toward people over 40, or even 50. An arbitrary line I know, but I'm not sure that anyone younger could really appreciate why in the world Alec or Steve would be attracted to Meryl Streep. I do believe you have to be over a certain age to understand this film. So the rating is really probably more moot than anything.Generally the film is well produced. The director got a bit mixed up with her soft focus views of Meryl Streep. There wasn't a real coda built around that lens, and Nancy Meyers could have very easily done that. It crept in a bit near the end, but was inconsistent. I have to admit, I'm a real sucker for The Parent Trap, her first film as director, (The Parent Trap (Special Edition)), it is one of my guilty pleasures. There are some pretty nasty pacing problems where editing was needlessly choppy. It seemed as if Ms. Meyers had to work with some bad takes trying to piece the story together. Sound was really nothing very special, mostly focusing on dialog. The soundtrack was pretty amazing. I liked a lot of the song choices which reinforced certain key moments in the film. Songs like Suite Judy Blue Eyes, the song about Steven Stills affair with Judy Collins - how appropriate in this film. Beyond that a good blending of current songs with 70's, and 80's music.The performances were special. How John Krasinski got coerced to show up in the little girl white tee shirt and girl pajama bottoms with kisses on them is beyond me. There were big laughs as he left that scene showing off his rear. Meryl Streep is just outstanding. I have never been a fan of Ms. Streep. Ever since did the horrible coming and going accent in Sophie's Choice, I've pretty much hated her. This film alone has completely changed my mind. There were some ad lib moments that were flat, but overall, an excellent performance. Alec Baldwin has played the same character over and over, but I happen to really like it. The SNL Schwetty balls sketch remains one of my favorites. He is a total pig in this film. He plays a gutless lawyer that is only interested in what can make him happy. And that is just perfect. Steve Martin got dealt a really bad role in this film. I love Steve Martin and wish he had some funnier lines. The marijuana scene is pretty funny, except that he mostly just does his big old Steve Martin grin we've all seen a thousand times. This is not a very good Martin vehicle. The three children are simply pitiful. Three of the most cardboard performances I've seen in a long time. Gratefully they are in the film a very short time.At almost 2 hours the film is a bit long. The midpoint doldrums set in. The jokes are much better in the last half of the film. The Webcam scene is simply classic and really funny.This was a wonderful movie for a date with my wife on Christmas day. The theater was packed and the second show had a long line. I love that there is a finally a decent movie for people over 20.",5,Loved This Movie,1261699200,"12 25, 2009",2009,5343,"['Eric', 'Baldwin', 'pig', 'Meryl', 'Streep', 'gorgeous', 'natural', 'Steve',

1291760,AIMGHPI1AGVRF,B002VECM1S,Davewise,"[0, 1]","As a fan of romantic comedies, I found ""It's Complicated"" to be only mildly funny and somewhat romantic. It follows the standard formula of having a woman and two men - one whom she shouldn't like or date but does anyway and another who is the more obvious choice but she messes things up with. There's nothing wrong with using an old formula (""there is nothing new under the sun"") but this movie doesn't add much to it. The only real twist is that Jane (Meryl Streep) used to be married to Jake (Alec Baldwin), the guy she shouldn't get involved with but does anyway, and now she's the ""other woman"" since he's been remarried. Somewhat ironically, Jake is married to the woman with whom he cheated while previously married to Jane. Adam (Steve Martin) is the architect working on Jane's addition who somehow knows exactly what she wants, and is the guy she should be dating.Meryl Streep is very good (rarely is she anything less) and is basically the highlight of the movie. Her character is clearly conflicted over her affair with her ex and she plays it rather well. Alec Baldwin is fine playing the ex who is clearly unhappy with his new marriage and regrets his past mistakes, although he hasn't changed much since then. Steve Martin can play understated characters as well as he does comedy, but he seems under-utilized here.There are some funny moments, but overall the movie feels a bit too repetitive. Some moments, such as when the four grown-up children of the divorced couple are in bed together commiserating, do not feel genuine. Streep's performance is the one saving grace here, but even that isn't quite enough for me.

There's muted sex but nothing explicit or nudity of any sort.  My guess is probably the casual attitude towards marijuana that got the movie slapped with the restricted rating.  That's not to say that too manyteenagers would be inclined to see this movie.  I'm reminded years ago of a vignette on ""The Simpsons"" where the boys are sneaking into an ""R"" rated movie and it happens to be ""Barton Fink"".  I digress however.  This picture is a joy.  Writer-director Nancy Meyers again has the pulse on love and relationships among the mature set.  I'm talking age here because Alec Baldwin's character seems to be reliving his childhood in a good way that is.  The premise of a divorced couple rekindling their past relationship in lesser hands could have misfired.  Meyers, however, not only mines the humor but tackles the morality and the effects the ""affair"" has on the ones we love.  The film is ably abetted by the performances of Meryl Streep, a restrained Steve Martin, and Alec Baldwin who in his middle-age dotage has become a master comedian.

1291768,A1JV4QKTEB7QBL,B002VECM1S,"Diana F. Von Behren ""reneofc""","[5, 6]","In ""It's Complicated,"" director Nancy Meyers accomplishes what she did in her earlier film, ""Something's Gotta Give""; she creates a great female character who is over fifty-five, succeeds financially in the world without a man and still has the potential and desire to not only have a fantasy romance, but to do so with gusto.  Unlike other `Ms.' magazine-reading cronies of her generation, Meyers' Jane Adler (Meryl Streep) character is not afraid to admit that she is lonely and that she feels badly when she sees couples trysting in hotels together or her ex-husband (Alec Baldwin) married to a much younger hard-body executive (Lake Bell.)  However, as an experienced woman that can hold her own, she's got a few tricks up her sleeve proving that as we age our windows don't get narrower, they get wider if we just allow them to open. ""It's Complicated"" may rely on some clich&eacute;s, but it's a feel-good film that keeps the audience laughing with its well-timed jokes honed by masters like Streep, Baldwin and Steve Martin and showcased against the backdrop of wealth so casually presented it seems de rigueur for this age group.As she does in ""Something's Gotta Give,"" Meyers plays her comedy of manners 2010-style setting her heroine as the coveted jewel beside not one but two male protagonists.  Stereotypes abound, but Meyers debunks them quickly with some nifty reverse psychology that definitely runs against the current current.  Despite post-menopausal urgings from her chic girl posse, Streep's Jane is not in the market for a man, nor does she seem to be the diva collector a la thoseSex and the City: The Complete Series (Collector's Giftset)gals who hunt either men or shoes.  Like Keaton's Erica in Something's Gotta Give, Jane possesses a savvy wisdom. Streep makes what she does for a living look simple; both characters' clothing and homes provide the perfect backdrop to studied elegance and ease that Meyers obviously feels should be owned by women in this part of their lives.Although the men in this piece are not to be overlooked by any means, they are served as vegetables to further enhance the flavor of Streep as the full-bodied main dish.  Baldwin reeks with the smarmy superiority of the know-it-all male in the throes of his second family with all the traipsings of his overblown vanity--the escapist's black Porsche, buns of steel trophy wife sporting designer sunglasses, matching cell phone and curly-topped over-indulged 5-year old stepson. Meyers' enjoys giving her viewers a long and too lingering look at Baldwin's hirsute watermelon gut that allows women in the audience to indulge in a little ""ha-ha"" at the expense of men who suddenly are being looked at with the same microscope that have forced females of a certain age into the plastic surgeon's office.  In another scene, Streep critiques the fuddy-duddy wardrobe of nerdy architect Adam, played with a stifled `please,-don't-reject-me discomfort by Steve Martin who should be a man about town with his great job and checking account.  In Meyers' fairytales, her women have it going on from the start; the men figure out what their wise women are about and what they know as the story unfolds.  From the start it is a man's world, but as the tables turn, Meyers' men realize their folly and cannot fail to admire what they should have been admiring from the get-go.This particular story lasts for just under two hours.  There are a few slow moments--but they are realistic ones where the character is allowed some time for a softly melodic introspection.  Streep's film family may be a little too picture perfect--their outfits match the studied home d&eacute;cor, but I believe this to be deliberate--their charming insouciance adds poignancy to the sadness the Adler divorce has wrought.  The jaw-dropping surprise on their cherubic faces punches up the gotcha line in the non-stop jokes to a contagious guffaw volume.  Meyers does the over 50s rom-com proud--""It's Complicated"" entertains with the veneer of affluence that underlines that beyond the so-called `good lives' of designer bakeries, houses in the hills or in the Hamptons, expensive cars and dream kitchens, we need validation for what we are and what we have chosen as we are nothing and enjoy nothing without having loving witnesses.Perhaps Meyers sets this film up as a cautionary tale for all those younger women out there who think they know more than an experienced woman. Maybe she's just looking for a little payback depending on her own circumstances.  Given this is a fiction, but nonetheless, I found Lake Bell's incredulous face while watching her older husband dance with his former same age wife enlightening.  Sometimes it takes more than a hard body and an iPhone App mentality; whatever your age the message is you have to work to keep what you've got and not take it for granted.Bottom line?  ""It's Complicated"" delights its audience with what one has come to expect from a Nancy Meyers' directed film.  With its strong 50s something woman lead, living in a stylized world where the character's good taste and high paying career lends a polished too perfect sanitized film-esque unreality to the reality, the film explores what would happen if suddenly a supposedly, `finished with each other' divorced couple fell in lust for each other.  Non-stop laughing ensues as Meyers charms you with the talented Meryl Streep and her bungling boyfriends of a certain age proving that as we age, our windows don't narrow; they get wider and funnier. Highly recommended especially if you liked ""Something's Gotta Give.""Diana Faillace Von Behren""reneofc""",4,The Window Gets Wider,1263600000,"01 16, 2010",2010,5626,"['Complicated', 'director',

Though she is a mother to three children, her brood has almost entirely left the nest. While at her youngest son's graduation from college, she bumps into her ex-husband (Alec Baldwin). The two have been divorced for 10 years but the chemistry between the two of them is still there. That night, the two unexpectedly have dinner together where Baldwin opens up that his new marriage is failing. Jane and Baldwin begin to have an affair which Jane believes is casual while Baldwin thinks it could be the cure to their failed marriage together. Enter into the mix, Steve Martin who plays Jane's architect who is helping her plan a renovation to her house. Martin is also divorced and he and Jane start a relationship. Of course, is is not your usual romantic rhombus because Jane and Baldwin have children. Jane is left to decide between taking a second stab at an already once-failed marriage or stepping outside her comfort zone and dating a new man.There are as many laughs in this film as there are tender moments. Though critics differed between praise and annoyance, no one can deny the charm and charisma that these actors (and their characters) have. Perhaps the most enchanting aspect of this film, is that it is real! Families nowadays, are no longer a mom, dad, sister, brother, and dog. It's Complicated not only acknowledges these changes, but is able to make us laugh about them. Of course, it is not a deep movie with a strong message but it's not supposed to be.

This middle-brow 2009 romantic triangle farce is no exception as it showcases Meryl Streep as Jane, the successful, late-fiftyish owner of a Santa Barbara boutique patisserie and the mother of three grown children. A decade after her divorce, she still has a congenial relationship with her ex-husband Jake who in true Hollywood-clich&eacute; style, left her to marry a much younger woman with abs of steel and a bratty five-year-old. As an empty-nester trying to get used to youngest daughter Gabby going off to college, Jane succumbs to Jake's charms in the bar of a New York hotel where the ex-spouses are staying to attend their son's college graduation.Their alcohol-infused one-night-stand kick-starts the predictable comedy hi-jinks with Jane's more-recently-divorced architect Adam thrown in the mix for good measure. Considering the star wattage involved, I was surprised how bored I was with the ensuing shenanigans despite the crack comic performances of Streep and Alec Baldwin as the smitten-again Jake. The first problem is that the movie feels overlong at 121 minutes with a slow set-up and an even more gradual wrap-up unfortunately peppered with a sitcom-level,Three's Company-style episode involving a webcam. The second problem is casting Steve Martin, surgically altered and looking like a waxwork, as Adam, a role that begs for flashes of his old wild-and-crazy persona but ends up being a persistent milquetoast who hardly seems romantic rival enough for the far more vibrant and impulsive Jake. Even Martin's brief moment of comic glory during the pot-smoking scene is stolen by Streep's more natural, free-wheeling style.The rest of the cast is given short shrift in Meyers' belabored screenplay with Lake Bell in the woefully underwritten role of Jake's predictably curt wife and the young actors playing Jane's children - Caitlin Fitzgerald, Hunter Parrish and Zoe Kazan - particularly unctuous and irritating. However, John Krasinski (Away We Go) shines in the minor role of eldest daughter Lauren's affable husband who unexpectedly discovers the affair between Jane and Jake in an amusingly slapstick fashion. John Toll's crisp, lifestyle-magazine-style cinematography makes the movie feel like an extended Food Network program. The 2010 DVD offers just one significant extra, a decent feature-length audio commentary track with Meyers, Toll, executive producer Suzanne Farwell, and editor Joe Hutshing.

1291785,A1JKFUUCZRA3Z4,B002VECM1S,Elisabeth,"[0, 0]","**This review contains spoilers**The message this movie spreads is that an affair is a terrific ego boost if you're feeling lonely, and justified if the betrayed spouse is a cheater, too.  There's some minor heartbreak, but overall, everything works to your benefit.Jane (Meryl Streep) cheats with her married, ex-husband Jake (Alec Baldwin), and they both feel refreshed about it.Her therapist gives the ok as well, saying the affair will be a great learning tool for her.Her friends also cheer her on, saying she's ""allowed this one"" and assures her that Agnes, the woman Jake left her for, is the one to hate.However, it's hypocritical of them to hate Agnes for her greedy behavior but then encourage Jane to engage in the same greedy behavior.  Being cheated on first doesn't mean two wrongs make a right.And if her friends hate Agnes, then they must hate Agnes's son, too, because his innocent life would also get turned upside down by the affair she's ""allowed"".Speaking of kids, neither Jane nor Jake consider how their affair might affect their kids' lives.  Instead they're too caught up believing that if something feels good, you should do it.  In the end, they even both agree they don't regret their affair.They shook up the lives of their innocent kids, an innocent son, and an innocent man who's heart got broken (Adam, played by Steve Martin) all over greed....and yet, if they could do it all over again, they would?Both Jane and Jake were too self-centered to offer real love to anyone.  Jake insists this affair reveals his undying love for Jane, but really, it's just an excuse to run away from adult responsibilities.  Jake is a narcissist who treats people like toys and when one toy breaks, he replaces it with another.In his first marriage, Jane was a good toy who took care of him.  However, she broke when kids came along and she had to split her attention with him.  He then replaced her with a new toy who adored him...but alas, that toy broke, too, when she had a son and her attention got split as well.So history repeats itself with Jake running off to another toy, Jane, who's waiting to be played with again.  She's more appealing now because with kids grown, she can pay more attention to him.  And just like before, instead of closing one relationship before opening another, he strings both toys along because they're both still useful.The kids are objects to Jake, too.  In one scene, he manipulates them with fake tears so they'll pressure Jane into letting him stay the night.  He says he misses the kids but that's only because all that's required of him is to eat dinner (that Jane prepared with him in mind) and watch tv on the couch.  If any adult problems emerged, he'd split in a second.Jane's character isn't any better...though she tries to redeem herself, saying if only she didn't feel so much guilt and fear, she'd lighten up about this affair.However, for like 90% of the movie, she's giggling and squealing with laughter.  Her conscience seemed pretty clear to me.Also, like Jake, she doesn't respect the boundaries of marriage.  She starts the affair because she wanted to experiment if something was still there with Jake.However, because Jake is married, she no longer had that right.  Despite what her friends said, she was NOT ""allowed this one"".I think this sentiment was just to make Jane seem deep, but she's not.  She told her friends that Jake was an ""ex with benefits"", so she was clearly looking for a fling to boost her ego.  No deeper meaning was intended.I would've given this movie 2 stars if Adam had left Jane like he originally planned.  He was a decent guy who was too good for Jane.Jane flaked on Adam twice...yet gets angry when Jake flakes on her once.And the only reason she invited Adam to her son's party was to make Jake jealous...and yet, she accuses Jake of only thinking of himself.In rom-coms, though, serious problems get neatly resolved, so Adam goes back to her.  It's a bad move, though.  Not only does he deserve better, but in the scene before, there's clearly unresolved feelings between Jane and Jake.So I could neither root for this couple like I was supposed to nor support the warped message that greed is good.",1,Greed is good,1403222400,"06 20, 2014",2014,4205,"['**This', 'review', 'spoilers**The', 'message', 'movie', 'affair', 'terrific', 'ego', 'boost', ""'re"", 'feeling', 'lonely', 'justified', 'betrayed', 'spouse', 'cheater', 'too', 'minor', 'heartbreak', 'overall', 'everything', 'works', 'benefit.Jane', 'Meryl', 'Streep', 'married', 'ex-husband', 'Jake', 'Alec', 'Baldwin', 'feel', 'refreshed', 'it.Her', 'therapist', 'ok', 'as', 'well', 'saying', 'affair', 'will', 'be', 'great', 'learning', 'tool', 'her.Her', 'friends', 'also', 'cheer', 'saying', 'allowed', 'one', 'Agnes', 'woman', 'Jake', 'left', 'one', 'hate.However', 'hypocritical', 'hate', 'Agnes', 'greedy', 'behavior', 'then', 'encourage', 'Jane', 'engage', 'same', 'greedy', 'behavior', 'Being', 'cheated', 'first', ""n't"", 'mean', 'two', 'wrongs', 'make', 'right.And', 'friends', 'hate', 'Agnes', 'then', 'must', 'hate', 'Agnes', 'son', 'too', 'innocent', 'life', 'would', 'also', 'get', 'turned', 'upside', 'down', 'affair', 'allowed', '.Speaking', 'kids', 'Jane', 'Jake', 'consider', 'how', 'affair', 'might', 'affect', 'kids', 'lives', 'Instead', ""'re"", 'too', 'caught', 'up', 'believing', 'something', 'feels', 'good', 'should', 'do', 'end', 'even', 'agree', 'do', ""n't"", 'regret', 'affair.They', 'shook', 'up', 'lives', 'innocent', 'kids', 'innocent', 'son', 'innocent', 'man', 'who', 'heart', 'got', 'broken', 'Adam', 'played', 'Steve', 'Martin', 'greed', '.and', 'yet', 'could', 'do', 'over', 'again', 'would', 'Jane', 'Jake', 'were', 'too', 'self-centered', 'offer', 'real', 'love', 'anyone', 'Jake', 'insists', 'affair', 'undying', 'love', 'Jane', 'really', 'just', 'excuse', 'run', 'away', 'adult', 'responsibilities', 'Jake', 'narcissist', 'who', 'people', 'toys', 'when', 'one', 'toy', 'breaks', 'first', 'marriage', 'Jane', 'was', 'good', 'toy', 'who', 'took', 'care', 'However', 'broke', 'when', 'kids', 'came', 'along', 'had', 'split', 'attention', 'then', 'replaced', 'new', 'toy', 'who', 'adored', 'alas', 'toy', 'broke', 'too', 'when', 'had', 'son', 'attention', 'got', 'split', 'well.So', 'history', 'repeats', 'Jake', 'running', 'off', 'toy', 'Jane', 'who', 'waiting', 'be', 'played', 'again', 'more', 'appealing', 'now', 'kids', 'grown', 'can', 'pay', 'more', 'attention', 'just', 'before', 'instead', 'closing', 'one', 'relationship', 'opening', 'toys', ""'re"", 'still', 'useful.The', 'kids', 'are', 'objects', 'Jake', 'too', 'one', 'scene', 'fake', 'tears', ""'ll"", 'pressure', 'Jane', 'letting', 'stay', 'night', 'kids', 'only', 'required', 'eat', 'dinner', 'Jane', 'prepared', 'mind', 'watch', 'tv', 'couch', 'adult', 'problems', 'emerged', ""'d"", 'split', 'second.Jane', 'character', ""n't"", 'better', 'redeem', 'saying', 'only', 'did', ""n't"", 'feel', 'so', 'much', 'guilt', 'fear', ""'d"", 'lighten', 'up', 'affair.However', '90', '%', 'movie', 'giggling', 'squealing', 'laughter', 'conscience', 'seemed', 'pretty', 'clear', 'me.Also', 'Jake', ""n't"", 'respect', 'boundaries', 'marriage', 'affair', 'wanted', 'experiment', 'something', 'was', 'still', 'Jake.However', 'Jake', 'married', 'no', 'longer', 'had', 'right', 'what', 'friends', 'said', 'was', 'NOT', 'allowed', 'one', '.I', 'think', 'sentiment', 'was', 'just', 'make', 'Jane', 'seem', 'deep', 'not', 'told', 'Jake', 'was', 'ex', 'benefits', 'was', 'clearly', 'looking', 'fling', 'boost', 'ego', 'deeper', 'meaning', 'was', 'intended.I', 'would', ""'ve"", 'given', 'movie', '2', 'stars', 'Adam', 'had', 'left', 'Jane', 'originally', 'planned', 'was', 'decent', 'guy', 'who', 'was', 'too', 'good', 'Jane.Jane', 'flaked', 'Adam', 'twice', 'yet', 'angry', 'when', 'Jake', 'flakes', 'once.And', 'only', 'reason', 'invited', 'Adam', 'son', 'party', 'was', 'make', 'Jake', 'jealous', 'yet', 'Jake', 'only', 'thinking', 'himself.In', 'rom-coms', 'serious', 'problems', 'get', 'neatly', 'resolved', 'so', 'Adam', 'back', 'bad', 'move', 'though', 'Not', 'only', 'deserve', 'better', 'scene', 'clearly', 'unresolved', 'feelings', 'Jane', 'Jake.So', 'could', 'neither', 'root', 'couple', 'was', 'supposed', 'support', 'warped', 'message', 'greed', 'good']",N/A

Meryl and Alec are high 50's so when you see them mostly naked, it's pretty realistic. But oh what a funny movie it is. I laughed so much it hurt, and I enjoyed the personality Meryl portrayed like the professional she is, and Steve martin's character was also very endearing. Alec did an excellent job playing the 'bad guy' -- regretting his divorce enough to cheat with his ex-wife -- so the cast was wonderful.There is (nearly) unapologetic marijuana use in the film. The grown-up characters smoke pot and giggle and the 20-something children chastise them and are embarrassed. How's that for a switch? The pot-smoking scenes were hilarious and harmless otherwise.There is an awareness of adultery. Meryl is worried about committing adultery which I find refreshing in our progressive-leaning world. And Steve Martin plays such a straight romantic character that you really root for him to 'get the girl.'I have to give this movie 5-Stars for comedy and acting.

Well it seems so to Meyers whose long string of 'feminist movies' (Father of the Bride I & II, Something's Gotta Give, The Holiday, What Women Want, The Parent Trap, etc) writes in her script.  The story here is a rather silly overlong joke about the affair between a divorced man and woman, with a family of kids thrown in for comments, and a gaggle of chatty girlfriends who make the situation seem palatable.  But 'IT'S COMPLICATED' works on one level: Meryl Streep takes on yet another role that challenges her to step into a character and make her credible and as usual she is a delight to watch.  She is aided by Alec Baldwin as her ex-husband/lover and Steve Martin as a wannabe boyfriend.  Streep's peppery gaggle of girlfriends have most of the entertaining chatter - especially fine work from Rita Wilson, Mary Kay Place, and Nora Dunn.

I'm fine with that - deception and selfishness are part and parcel of the human condition But few films fail to bring laughter from the pain as much as this one. Meryl Streep plays Janey, the wildly successful owner of a pastry empire, divorced 10 years prior by her husband, Jake (Alec Baldwin), for a younger woman. While celebrating their youngest son's college graduation, they have a fling that threatens not only Jake's new family, but also Janey's precarious sense of personhood, their kids' emotional health and the fragile personality of a friend.  Each of Janey and Jake's utterly narcissistic decisions is deeply wounding to someone they love. Worse, friends and advisors inexplicably encourage this. It's hard to make a comedy out of that kind of recklessness. Streep mugs and sighs her way through film. It was amazing to see how many times ""&lt;Exhales""> shows up in the subtitles when she is on screen. Steve Martin acts even more rigidly in this film than in most. During his one bit of buffoonery, playing himself while high, I couldn't help think ""Let's get small!"" from his old comedy routines.

I think you have to mention John Krasinski since he did steal a few scenes in the movie.  First, I liked the movie.  It was funny in parts, sad in others, endearing, heartwarming, emotional, and overall a decent depiction of the insanity that can occur in a marriage, or even long after two people are divorced.  As I have discovered firsthand, it doesn't matter if you are divorced.  Your ex-wife never goes away if you have children.  Sadly for me I am definitely not divorced from Meryl Streep though.Anyway, the movie takes place several years after Jake, (Alec Baldwin) and Jane (Meryl Streep) have divorced.  They have three kids, two girls and a son.  One of their daughters has married.  Jake cheated on his wife, (why is it the guy has to always be the bad guy in the movies), and then married the much younger woman.  While she is absolutely smoking hot, she is a complete and total bitch.  Jane on the other hand has never found a long term love interest, but she has focused on finding herself, and has flourished in her career as a bakery owner.Jack and Jane head to their youngest son's graduation in New York.  Jack's young tart of a wife can't make it and one thing leads to another.  Jack and Jane in up in bed.  Things really heat up when the formerly jilted wife realizes she is having some fun with her ex-husband.  He in turn figures out that she was pretty damn good, asking himself why he left her in the first place.  What do they say; the grass is not always greener on the other side.  Interestingly enough with growth comes change, and in the end Jane has left the childish antics of her ex-husband by the wayside.  Again, I sure as hell wish my ex-wife would have been Meryl Streep.What is the word I am looking for, anyway.  There are several laughs and it becomes touching when you see the two acknowledge that they really have grown apart.  You move from feeling sorry for Jane in the beginning, to admiring the woman she has turned out to be in the end.  I guess it really does take most of us sixty plus years to finally grow up.  I wonder what I will do when that finally happens.I thoroughly enjoyed the movie.  Alec Baldwin was great and Meryl Streep was fantastic as always.  Steve Martin played a forgettable role so he didn't have much meat, but I will always love the aging comedian.  I would highly recommend this movie to anyone who is beyond their teen years.

If you're getting a mixed message about my feelings for this movie, that's how I feel, too.What I did not like:1. Meryl Streep's very annoying, affected mannerisms. They reminded me too much of Jessica Lange's annoying mannerisms.2. Alec Baldwin's over-the-top loopy-dopey crush on what he lost and cannot have again.3. Mucking around in a dead relationship4. Having three tiny-faced children from two big-faced parents5. The silliness of the rich who can have it all except for what all of the rest of us also want6. Fairy tale endingWhat I loved:1. That a movie features two older people who ""fall in love"" and have sex!!2. The fact that quality aging actresses like Streep can be given such a lovely script about love among 50-plus people3. That a broken family can be re-united--happily and peacefully--even for a day or two (this is a wow factor)4. How foolish a man looks married to a woman half his age5. A movie starring older actors/actresses6. Fairy tale ending with a twist: Instead of the surety of a happily-ever-after, the presentation of a possibility. Romantic dreamers will see a sure thing, but those of us with dead, broken hearts see a possibility that is as pleasing as a certainty and more realistic.I cried at that possibility.

1291838,A28OB1QLXN5BM6,B002VECM1S,"Karen Joan ""Siren""","[35, 38]","We watched IT'S COMPLICATED the other night, with multiple generations in attendance.  And everyone laughed out loud.  IT'S COMPLICATED is a light-hearted, refreshing romantic comedy that will entertain you, brighten your spirit, and make you smile.In IT'S COMPLICATED, Jane and Jack have been divorced for 10 years now, and they have finally come to a sort of workable truce.  They have three nearly grown kids together.  Jane has a very successful restaurant, and Jake is happily married to the younger woman with whom he cheated.  Or is he?  Unacustomed time alone together at their youngest son's college graduation leads to an unexpected night in bed together.  This one-night-stand blossoms into a full blown affair, which leaves Jane, Jake, and the entire audience wondering if old wounds can be healed and old love rekindled.While the plot of IT'S COMPLICATED really isn't (it's really pretty formulaic), the acting is truly magnificant.  Meryl Streep, Alec Baldwin, and Steve Martin imbue their characters with life; they truly jump off the screen.  Meryl Streep is luminous - funny, warm, gorgeous, sentimental, sympathetic, sensual, and sexy as all get out.  Wow, Meryl, please keep proving that life does not end at 40 and that Hollywood is not just for starlets.  Alec Baldwin is excellent as Jake - a confused, aging little boy who wants whatever it is that he doesn't have.  A near perfect role for Alec Baldwin.  And Steve Martin as Adam, Jane's hope-to-be boyfriend, gives one of his best performances in years.  The three of them have superb chemistry, and that alone makes this a 5 star film.  The supporting cast are equally up to the task, and add depth and nuance to this film.IT'S COMPLICATED is a delightful way to spend a cozy evening cuddled up with the one you love.

Throughout this entire, ridiculous film, she is laughing. She is breathless, giggly, and always laughing, at seemingly anything. It's as if Hollywood insists that women become less serious as they grow older; less weighty, frivolous, and more prone to idiocy. Consider Diane Keaton: with each perfomance, she becomes increasingly moronic. You can't take these characters seriously, which seems to be the intention.There is hardly an intelligent sentence throughout this film. I was shocked that Mary Kay Place, an excellent actress, was given one sentence of dialogue. Why even bother? How insulting. And Rita Wilson - she really needs to stop being the bubble-headed ""friend"" on the sideline. You have a scene where a group of midlife women are shreiking and laughing as though they're in grade 8. Couldn't someone have written some really good dialogue? Are we afraid to think? If your 50-something friend was having an affair with her ex-husband, there would be an opportunity for some great conversation. In this film, everything generates hilarity, usually with the help of copious amounts of wine. There are teenagers out there having deeper discussions than what you'd find here.This movie is at times mildy amusing, but it's not funny; true comedy requires good writing.

Meryl Streep (Jane Adler)  is excellent as a single mom, divorced from Alex Baldwin (Jake Adler)  who is remarried to a younger woman (Agnes) with a young child (Pedro).  They meet in NY for their son's college graduation and hilarity begins when the little boy is ill and Jake has a night out on his own and has dinner with Jane. I don't want to give too much away. Jane has 3 supportive girlfriends, two are played by Mary Kay Place and Rita Wilson (who btw is Mrs. Tom Hanks in real life!) but I cannot remember the other actress's name, but all are awesome in their roles. Actually it starts to get pretty funny right off, especially after Jane's odd visit to a plastic surgeon where she bumps into Jake who joins her in the elevator when leaving a fertility clinic. (I haven't ""found my voice"" in making reviews yet so please excuse that) Throughout the movie there is so much that's both poignant and hilarious. Meryl Streep and Alex Baldwin have great chemistry together, as does Meryl and Steve Martin, her architect, when he joins in the fun. As a whole, the movie is laugh out loud funny and at times you also need a box of tissues nearby. In my opinion, it's my personal Meryl Steep favorite. She can play any part with such realism and so believable, a fantastic actress! She pulls off Jane Adler in It's Complicated as most believable as every character she's ever played. She really deserved an Oscar for this one!On this two disc set -- I Googled a couple Dvd sites since Amazon gives no info. One store says that the other disc is music downloads. Supposed to be 10 there, though on a review one woman said she got 6. In any case, that's what's on it for everyone who's asking - music downloads. I think I will go ahead and ""spring"" for the 2 disc version myself. There was good music in the film so in case that's what it is, I'll bite.This is a movie you'll watch over and over and over again if you are big Rom-com fan like I am.

Moreso than and other actress (or actor) Streep is a chameleon, who takes on new totally different roles and completely inhabits the characters without leaving any traces of herself. It astounds this reviewer to think this was the same actress who portrayed chef Julia Child in ""Julie and Julia"" and a very strict nun in ""Doubt"" within the last two years! And she was totally convincing, and gave Oscar worthy performances in all three roles!Whenever we see actors drunk (or high) on the screen we must realize they are not. They are stone cold sober or they couldn't act, which makes her many intoxicated scenes all the more funny and marvelous.Meryl and costar Alec Baldwin look heavier, older and more middleaged here then I have ever seen them , which lends credibility to their roles. It is difficult to believe this is the same actress who just played the severe, thin nun. John Krasinski is also funny in support role as questioning in-law. Steve Martin, as is said elsewhere, is NOT over-the-top in his understated role as shy boyfiend.There is a very funny scene with a computer with video. Alec Baldwin is hilarious playing an over-the-top role a bit similar to 30 Rock but with a lot more comedy and romance.

Jane continued her role as mother to their three children as well as owning a very successful, and might I add visually tempting, restaurant.A chance encounter for their youngest son's college graduation has the couple back in the sack again.  Jane's feeling pretty empowered cheating on the woman who broke up her marriage--after all, she's not an adulteress if she had Jake first.  And Jake, who is feeling pretty old and tired dealing with fertility treatments and a son who is old enough to be his grandson, is falling back in love with Wife Number One.Enter Adam (Martin) the architect for the new addition to Jane's lovely home and you've got a love triangle building.  Add to that son-in-law to be Harley (Krasinski) and you've got an ensemble cast that's taking Nancy Meyers's hilarious lines and turning them into a visual treat as well.  Probably the funniest performance in the whole film is actually Harley, who discovers the affair and tries to keep it secret from his wife-to-be.Overall, the music, scenery, and acting is very well done.

1291905,A2R1HAXRNU0QX7,B002VECM1S,RMurray847,"[6, 11]","IT'S COMPLICATED is an amiable mess of a movie, coasting on our good feelings about the actors who are in it, rather than truly creating characters we care about.  It's packed full of annoying clich&eacute;s, and although relatively short, it feels too long.Meryl Streep has been divorced from Alec Baldwin for about 10 years.  She lives near the California coast in a house that would cost about $10,000,000...but she's got an architect (Steve Martin) designing an enormous addition for her, so she can have her ""dream kitchen"" and ""dream bedroom,"" even though what she has now would make most of us drool.  She is apparently paying for this due to the success of a BAKERY that she runs, because apparently, this is the year for Meryl Streep to play women who succeed with cooking (see JULIE AND JULIA).Baldwin, her ex, is married to a far younger woman (Lake Bell), who has brought to their marriage a young child from a fling she engaged in when she was temporarily split from Baldwin.  She also wants another child, and Baldwin (correctly, in my opinion) is not thrilled with the idea of being a father again at age roughly 58.Streep and Baldwin take a trip to NYC with their kids to celebrate the graduation of their son (Hunter Parrish, from WEEDS, in a totally unconvincing performance) from college.  While there,  they have dinner and drinks together in the hotel restaurant, get sloppy drunk and have amazing sex in her room.  This blossoms into an ""affair"" between the two...Streep clearly is enjoying being a bit naughty, but Baldwin becomes clingy and is convinced that the two of them are meant to be together again.  The two performers do generate some fun chemistry, and for much of the film, we actually root for Baldwin to win his argument.However, things become more ""complicated"" when Streep begins a new relationship with  her architect.  Steve Martin's character is kind and considerate where Baldwin's is boorish and passionate.  He's tender and affectionate, where Baldwin is much more forward.  Eventually, you begin to root for THAT relationship to succeed.  Naturally, there are MORE complications as the two men become wary of each other...and meanwhile Streep can't decide what she wants for certain.The behaviors of the characters, when distanced from the actors, seem quite self-centered, and Baldwin in particular is foolish.  He's made mistakes, but thinks he can charm himself back into everyone's good graces.  Frankly, if less likeable actors had played these roles, we'd find Streep ridiculously dithering, Baldwin merely sleazy and Martin whimpy.  (Oh, and we've also got THE OFFICE's John Krazinski playing a version of Jim from that show, as the future son-in-law who sees what's going on.  The result of his performance is, ""Oh, isn't it cute to see Jim appearing in this movie.""  It's not really a character and not really a performance.  We laugh, because he feels like Jim.)As I said, clich&eacute;s abound.  Streep has a group of three understanding friends who come over to her house for wine and laugh a lot and support all she does.  I'm tired of this clich&eacute;, particularly when two of the actresses are Rita  Wilson (who is just shrill in this role) and Alexandra Wentworth (who is a cipher in the film...not even a recognizable stereotype).  The wonderful Mary Kay Place is given nothing to do as the third friend...please, someone, give this actress a real role!  Some of the film's biggest laughs (and they are pretty big, I admit with guilt) come after several characters smoke pot.  Wow, a movie that has us laugh at how silly people act after smoking pot!!  Also, the movie shows us two very well-off people, but one is rich from a bakery and the other (Baldwin) is a partner in a law firm, but apparently he never actually has to go there.  He's always free to gallivant around.  At least we see Steve Martin working on occasion.  I get a bit weary of movies with people who all wear the best clothes, have gorgeous homes in spectacular locations, don't have to work hard, have loads of kids who are all intelligent, well-adjusted and live in homes they apparently do nothing to pay for, etc. etc.  Only these sorts of people can AFFORD to have the ""complicated"" problems they do.I'm as happy to have a pleasant diversion from ""real life"" as the next movie-goer, but can't writers come up with something that feels fresh and original?  I like Streep, Baldwin, Martin & Krazinski...but this movie really allows them all to coast on their charm and past accomplishments.  I appreciate the film because it shows older folks being heavily involved in passionate affairs and having strong libidos.  I did laugh a fair amount at the silliness as it was going on...but I also inwardly groaned a lot as one easy clich&eacute; after another was trotted out.

1291912,A19ZXK9HHVRV1X,B002VECM1S,Roland E. Zwick,"[0, 0]","Nancy Meyers makes smart, funny romantic comedies for thinking adults.  Her 2003 ""Something's Gotta' Give,"" with Diane Keaton and Jack Nicholson, was a near-classic of the genre.  Though her latest, ""It's Complicated,"" with Meryl Streep and Alec Baldwin, is nowhere near as good as that earlier film, it still manages to tickle the funny bone (from time to time) while providing us with a chance to watch some of Hollywood's most seasoned players still performing at the peak of their power.Like Keaton, Streep plays an attractive upper-class middle-aged woman who's suffering from empty-nest syndrome and a nonexistent love life.  Long divorced from the husband (Baldwin) who cheated on her, Jane has pretty much given up ever having much of a life of her own beyond her grown children and the restaurant she owns and operates in scenic Santa Barbara.  Much to her amazement, however, she finds herself rekindling a romance with the very man who left her to marry a younger woman ten years earlier.  Further complicating the issue is that Jane is also beginning to have feelings for an architect (Steve Martin) she's hired to help her remodel her house.As in too many romantic comedies, Meyers' characters live in a squeaky-clean, white-bread world of magazine-layout homes, upscale restaurants, pricey therapy sessions, and endless wine-sipping.  And there are times when the cutesiness does get a bit out of hand, particularly in the giggly, you-go-girl scenes between Jane and her requisite bevy of gossipy girlfriends (including an underused  Mary Kay Place), who relate their latest romantic escapades all the while bemoaning just what cads men as a whole are.  And the secondary characters - mainly the divorced couple's three children and their too-good-to-be-true son-in-law - aren't particularly well developed or played (this includes John Krasinski and Hunter Parrish, who are both much better in ""The Office"" and ""Weeds,"" respectively).But Streep, Baldwin and Martin are so confident and relaxed and play off one another with such alacrity and skill that we're pretty much willing to forgive any and all imperfections just to be able to revel in their performances.  Add to that Meyers' insights into just how complicated love and romance can be for the aging Baby Boomer set and you have the makings of a slick and enjoyable - if occasionally strained - comedy for grownups.",3,uneven script buoyed by fun performances,1279756800,"07 22, 2010",2010,2388,"['Nancy', 'Meyers', 'smart', 'funny', 'romantic', 'comedies', 'thinking', 'adults', '2003', 'Something', 'Got', 'ta', 'Give', 'Diane', 'Keaton', 'Jack', 'Nicholson', 'was', 'near-classic', 'genre', 'latest', 'Complicated', 'Meryl', 'Streep', 'Alec', 'Baldwin', 'nowhere', 'near', 'as', 'good', 'earlier', 'film', 'still', 'tickle', 'funny', 'bone', 'time', 'time', 'providing', 'chance', 'watch', 'Hollywood', 'most', 'seasoned', 'players', 'still', 'performing', 'peak', 'power.Like', 'Keaton', 'Streep', 'attractive', 'upper-class', 'middle-aged', 'woman', 'who', 'suffering', 'empty-nest', 'syndrome', 'nonexistent', 'love', 'life', 'Long', 'divorced', 'husband', 'Baldwin', 'who', 'cheated', 'Jane', 'pretty', 'much', 'given', 'up', 'ever', 'having', 'much', 'life', 'own', 'grown', 'children', 'restaurant', 'scenic', 'Santa', 'Barbara', 'Much', 'amazement', 'however', 'rekindling', 'romance', 'very', 'man', 'who', 'left', 'marry', 'younger', 'woman', 'ten', 'years', 'earlier', 'Further', 'complicating', 'issue', 'Jane', 'also', 'beginning', 'have', 'feelings', 'architect', 'Steve', 'Martin', 'hired', 'help', 'remodel', 'house.As', 'too', 'many', 'romantic', 'comedies', 'Meyers', 'characters', 'live', 'squeaky-clean', 'white-bread', 'world', 'magazine-layout', 'homes', 'upscale', 'restaurants', 'pricey', 'therapy', 'sessions', 'endless', 'wine-sipping', 'are', 'times', 'when', 'cutesiness', 'get', 'bit', 'hand', 'particularly', 'giggly', 'you-go-girl', 'scenes', 'Jane', 'requisite', 'bevy', 'gossipy', 'girlfriends', 'including', 'underused', 'Mary', 'Kay', 'Place', 'who', 'relate', 'latest', 'romantic', 'escapades', 'while', 'bemoaning', 'just', 'what', 'men', 'whole', 'are', 'secondary', 'characters', 'mainly', 'divorced', 'couple', 'three', 'children', 'too-good-to-be-true', 'son-in-law', 'are', ""n't"", 'particularly', 'well', 'developed', 'played', 'John', 'Krasinski', 'Hunter', 'Parrish', 'who', 'are', 'much', 'better', 'Office', 'Weeds', 'respectively', '.But', 'Streep', 'Baldwin', 'Martin', 'are', 'so', 'confident', 'relaxed', 'play', 'off', 'one', 'such', 'alacrity', 'skill', ""'re"", 'pretty', 'much', 'willing', 'forgive', 'imperfections', 'just', 'be', 'able', 'revel', 'performances', 'Add', 'Meyers', 'insights', 'just', 'how', 'complicated', 'love', 'romance', 'can', 'be', 'aging', 'Baby', 'Boomer', 'set', 'have', 'makings', 'slick', 'enjoyable', 'occasionally', 'strained', 'comedy', 'grownups']",N/A

And I suppose that in our world of today when we laugh at other people's pain and awful decisions so much, this could be considered a comedy--unfortunately, we saw almost nothing funny in it.  Meryl Streep plays a character who has been divorced for ten years who gets pushed into having an affair by her manipulative ex-husband (an attorney, played by Baldwin), and the movie degenerates into a series of deceptions and lies and bad decisions that are very hurtful to themselves and others.  I suppose this could be funny, but it's presented as somehow being a ""normal"" part of dealing with a divorce that had happened ten years earlier.It was sad and painful to watch these characters show their weaknesses and willingness to hurt others to fulfill their own selfish desires.  Baldwin is especially repulsive as an obsessed older man who even stoops to spying on his wife during one of her dates, looking in her kitchen window.The children are poorly developed as characters, so most of what we get from them is simply reaction to what their parents say and do.All in all, it just wasn't funny, the characters weren't always believable or likeable, and the script was simply lame.

1291922,A2PNTEDGMOLMOY,B002VECM1S,Scott Schiefelbein,"[2, 2]","Nancy Meyers' ""It's Complicated"" is a cheap Harlequin romance of a movie.  The story focuses on the largely self-inflicted problems of people who are actually pretty unlikeable for the most part, and many of the jokes are only so-so.But Meyers saved her film by having Meryl Streep and Alec Baldwin cast as the leads.  With Steve Martin playing a surprisingly straight supporting role, ""IC"" moves from pedestrian to pretty darn fun.Streep plays Jane, divorced mother of three angelic kids.  She's been divorced for ten years and is confronting empty nest syndrome now that her youngest is graduating from college.  (The three kids are so absolutely boring in their own right that they are reduced to plot devices and setting.)  Streep somehow saves Jane from being despicability.  Jane lives in apparent upper-middle class domesticity, until you realize that she lives in a multimillion dollar compound in Santa Barbara that is so tastefully appointed that Sunset Magazine would do a ten-page layout on the place.  But this isn't enough for Jane - she has to have it remodeled ""so she can get the kitchen she always wanted.""  Folks - the kitchen Jane seeks to replace is a kitchen to kill for.  The plain fact is that Jane is a materialistic witch who cannot be satisfied with perfection - she needs the satisfaction of anticipating perfection to excite her.But since she's played by Streep, we really don't care.  We love her.Streep's ex is Jake, played by Alec Baldwin in a movie-stealing performance.  Jake is a successful attorney (natch) who left Jane for Agness (the gorgeous Lake Bell).  Baldwin plays Jake as the kind of guy who can tell a woman, ""Of course I'm unfaithful - that's who I am - but you want to have an affair with me anyway, don't you?"" and make the line work.  He is unrepentently hedonist and charming . . . and he sets his sights on Jane when they are in New York attending their son's graduation.  (The movie poster gives away the fact that Jake and Jane end up in bed - this isn't a spoiler.)  Jane - to her surprise - enjoys being the ""other woman"" in Jake's life.Steve Martin complicates things mildly by stepping up as a candidate for boyfriend - he plays the architect who gets to redesign Jane's already-perfect residence.  Martin's performance is fine, but it is a surprise - he is so subdued and just plain-vanilla nice that we wonder why they bothered to cast Steve Martin in the role.  Come on!  He's Steve Martin!  There's got to be a dark side here somewhere, right?  By keeping Martin tightly bound in the Mr. Nice Guy role, he never seems a quite-appropriate foil for Jake.Ultimately, this movie is a trifle about older, attractive people confronting the bad choices they made in their younger days.  The filmmakers risk much by giving Jane such a perfect, effortless life.  Jane runs a definitely-charming Northern California bakery, although she seems to put in about 30 minutes a day worth of work.  Her garden is overflowing with perfectly-ripe and photogenic vegetables, and we never see her garden except for some picture-perfect harvesting.  Her house is immaculate, yet she never cleans.  Perhaps Dobby the House Elf works for her now that the Harry Potter franchise is coming to an end.Thanks to Baldwin and Streep, it's often hilarious, as these two actors use their boundless charm to distract you from the fact that both Jake and Jane are incredibly shallow, unlikeable people.

I think ""Devil Wears Prada,"" so when I heard about this film, I had no desire to see this at the show. I am definitely NOT a fan of Alec Baldwin (or his ridiculous instances on airplanes). Nothing about the previews made me want to see the film, even though I'm a big fan of ""The Office"" and like John Krasinski. However, I put this movie in my rental queue out of boredom and finally watched it. It started off slow and I didn't see the connection between Streep's character and Baldwin's character until the two of them ended up sleeping together. Even then, I was only slightly interested. But when Streep smoked weed and acted completely high out of her mind, I fell out laughing. I just started rewinding her scenes. That's not to say only marijuana humor amuses me, but I just wouldn't have thought she could pull it off. She is REALLY funny without trying too hard to be. I usually think Steve Martin tries too hard to be funny, but he toned it down a little and she turned her goofy side way up. She definitely made this movie. I'd buy this just to watch her in action. I should give her more credit as an actress and will open my mind to more of her movies after seeing this one, but first I want to get this one to laugh at it some more.Oddly enough, all of the adults were cooler than the kids.

The chemistry between the leads was pitch perfect.  The Santa Barbara setting is spectacular, I mean, WHO would not want to live there?  This is a movie that really doesn't lull, its pace is right on the money.  Frankly, I new I'd love Streep and Baldwin, but it was Martin that really made this movie for me, he is without question the most under-rated actor in Hollywood.  As for the cinemaphotography it is in word: spectacular!, I wanted to jump through the LCD and bask in the SoCal glow.  The supporting parts were well played as well, especially by the actor playing Streeps soon to be son-in-law.  I have to say the only thing I'd change about this fantatic film would be the actor that played Streeps youngest child, he seemed to be in wayyy over his head, it was as if he stumbled in from some show on the CW, he really needs some seasoning as an actor and playing against Streep and Baldwin was a trial by fire that left him scorched.

1291926,AWUUMER0F3WF4,B002VECM1S,Sheryl Fechter,"[1, 1]","From the writer and director Nancy Meyers comes a delicious tale of an ex-wife and mother, Jane (Meryl Streep) who has despised her ex-husband, Jake (Alec Baldwin) for ten years now.  She has no idea what she is going to do with him while situations have gotten exceptionally  unbelievable for her.  During a party for mutual friends, a spark fires rather hotly for a presently unhappy Jake towards his ex-wife, a quizzical Jane.  The couple had been married for nineteen years then divorced for ten and have three children together.  Lauren (Caitlin FitzGerald), her fiance, Harley (John Krasinski), along with Luke, (Hunter Parrish), who is graduating from college and the youngest, Gabby (Zoe Kazan), who is flying from the nest one year early and leaving Jane in the house alone for the very first time.She decides to make additions to really make her home all hers. She has been wanting to do this with an architect and meets Adam Schaffer (Steve Martin), a divorced man for two and a half years.  He is warm, kind and delicate with Jane, he sees her as someone very special.  With Jane he understands and is interested in her.  The two begin to be good friends and the feelings are flowing also conflicting with Jake.  While Adam is lovely, wanting to be near her, makes special dates with her, Jake keeps getting in the way.  Jane has an extensive history with Jake and a new palpable chemistry with Adam.  Now it's getting quite convoluted.  Both of these men want her and the same for her, although Jane is very reticent about being hurt again, controlled or compromised in any way.At the prior party they are discussing Luke's graduation and find that they are both staying at the same hotel in New York City.  As the kids dash off to a party together and Jake's wife doesn't come because of her son having an illness, they are kind of forced together when they accidentally meet at the bar while having a drink as each are flying solo.  Jane gives into Jake's invite for dinner for old times sake as the wine corks fly.  Dancing, more drinking and a connection is definitely made here at the hotel, they end up having sex and immediately Jane is bewildered how and why she let this happen.  Is everything between the two of them really over?  Are unresolved feelings still there?  Does she want revenge for him cheating on her?  Her motives become more and more unclear to her as the movie moves along and she begins an affair with him, now becoming the other woman.  Jake is besotted.  He cannot relate to his new young wife, Agnes (Lake Bell), that could almost be his daughter along with her very young son.  She also is ready and trying to have more children, which Jake is not in the same boat with.  He believes he already has his own along with Jane, and believes them to be his family.Jane, on the other hand, is torn between Jake and Adam.  Two very different men, one manipulative with feelings and the other respectful of her.  Jake just keeps pushing her and begins using their children to bring the old family together, while they are getting suspicious of their parents communication that they try to hide.  Hats off to their children's acting and for John Krasinski. He is less on dialogue and more on expression, adding an easy laughter when this movie starts to get pretty farcical.  There becomes a lot of confusion between Jane and Jake and then toss in the fun she has with Adam as Jane tosses in a little partying extra, at Lauren's party.  This is a real relationship story with real people and emotions, like Jane and Adam in her bakery making warm chocolate croissants.  This scene in Jane's bakery shows Adam's true colors and the warmth that has grown between them.Nancy Meyers taps into her script very accurately bringing this story a huge humorous feel and adds heart to the situations.  She helps her actors be more erratic, scattered and much more relatable.  A heartwarming and hysterical film at times.  At the end of this movie we are left with the inevitable decision:  Will we end with Jane along with Jake, making the decision to start over with one tried and now true?  Or Jane with one true and not altogether tried? Or Jane turning completely to enjoy her own life finally at a suitable time for herself which she has greatly developed in the past ten years?  But with her decision, ""It's Complicated"".",5,"""Ya Know, I've Never Learned How To Live Without You"" - Jake",1395792000,"03 26, 2014",2014,4353,"['writer', 'director', 'Nancy', 'Meyers', 'delicious', 'tale', 'ex-wife', 'mother', 'Jane', 'Meryl', 'Streep', 'who', 'despised', 'ex-husband', 'Jake', 'Alec', 'Baldwin', 'ten', 'years', 'now', 'idea', 'what', 'going', 'do', 'situations', 'have', 'gotten', 'exceptionally', 'unbelievable', 'party', 'mutual', 'friends', 'spark', 'rather', 'hotly', 'presently', 'unhappy', 'Jake', 'towards', 'ex-wife', 'quizzical', 'Jane', 'couple', 'had', 'been', 'married', 'nineteen', 'years', 'then', 'divorced', 'ten', 'have', 'three', 'children', 'together', 'Lauren', 'Caitlin', 'FitzGerald', 'fiance', 'Harley', 'John', 'Krasinski', 'Luke', 'Hunter', 'Parrish', 'who', 'graduating', 'college', 'youngest', 'Gabby', 'Zoe', 'Kazan', 'who', 'flying', 'nest', 'one', 'year', 'early', 'leaving', 'Jane', 'house', 'alone', 'very', 'first', 'time.She', 'make', 'additions', 'really', 'make', 'home', 'hers', 'been', 'wanting', 'do', 'architect', 'meets', 'Adam', 'Schaffer', 'Steve', 'Martin', 'divorced', 'man', 'two', 'half', 'years', 'warm', 'kind', 'delicate', 'Jane', 'someone', 'very', 'special', 'Jane', 'interested', 'two', 'begin', 'be', 'good', 'friends', 'feelings', 'are', 'flowing', 'also', 'conflicting', 'Jake', 'Adam', 'lovely', 'wanting', 'be', 'special', 'dates', 'Jake', 'getting', 'way', 'Jane', 'extensive', 'history', 'Jake', 'new', 'palpable', 'chemistry', 'Adam', 'Now', 'getting', 'quite', 'convoluted', 'men', 'want', 'same', 'Jane', 'very', 'reticent', 'being', 'hurt', 'again', 'controlled', 'compromised', 'way.At', 'prior', 'party', 'are', 'discussing', 'Luke', 'graduation', 'find', 'are', 'staying', 'same', 'hotel', 'New', 'York', 'City', 'kids', 'dash', 'off', 'party', 'together', 'Jake', 'wife', ""n't"", 'come', 'son', 'having', 'illness', 'are', 'kind', 'forced', 'together', 'when', 'accidentally', 'meet', 'bar', 'having', 'drink', 'are', 'flying', 'solo', 'Jane', 'Jake', 'invite', 'dinner', 'old', 'times', 'sake', 'wine', 'fly', 'Dancing', 'more', 'drinking', 'connection', 'definitely', 'made', 'here', 'hotel', 'end', 'up', 'having', 'sex', 'immediately', 'Jane', 'bewildered', 'how', 'why', 'let', 'happen', 'everything', 'two', 'really', 'Are', 'unresolved', 'feelings', 'still', 'want', 'revenge', 'cheating', 'motives', 'become', 'more', 'more', 'unclear', 'movie', 'along', 'affair', 'now', 'becoming', 'other', 'woman', 'Jake', 'besotted', 'can', 'not', 'relate', 'new', 'young', 'wife', 'Agnes', 'Lake', 'Bell', 'could', 'almost', 'be', 'daughter', 'very', 'young', 'son', 'also', 'ready', 'trying', 'have', 'more', 'children', 'Jake', 'not', 'same', 'boat', 'already', 'own', 'along', 'Jane', 'be', 'family.Jane', 'other', 'hand', 'torn', 'Jake', 'Adam', 'Two', 'very', 'different', 'men', 'one', 'manipulative', 'feelings', 'other', 'respectful', 'Jake', 'just', 'keeps', 'pushing', 'using', 'children', 'bring', 'old', 'family', 'together', 'are', 'getting', 'suspicious', 'parents', 'communication', 'try', 'hide', 'Hats', 'children', 'acting', 'John', 'Krasinski', 'less', 'dialogue', 'more', 'expression', 'adding', 'easy', 'laughter', 'when', 'movie', 'get', 'pretty', 'farcical', 'lot', 'confusion', 'Jane', 'Jake', 'then', 'toss', 'fun', 'Adam', 'Jane', 'little', 'partying', 'extra', 'Lauren', 'party', 'real', 'relationship', 'story', 'real', 'people', 'emotions', 'Jane', 'Adam', 'bakery', 'making', 'warm', 'chocolate', 'croissants', 'scene', 'Jane', 'bakery', 'Adam', 'true', 'colors', 'warmth', 'grown', 'them.Nancy', 'Meyers', 'script', 'very', 'accurately', 'bringing', 'story', 'huge', 'humorous', 'feel', 'heart', 'situations', 'actors', 'be', 'more', 'erratic', 'scattered', 'much', 'more', 'relatable', 'heartwarming', 'hysterical', 'film', 'times', 'end', 'movie', 'are', 'left', 'inevitable', 'decision', 'Will', 'end', 'Jane', 'Jake', 'making', 'decision', 'start', 'one', 'tried', 'now', 'true', 'Jane', 'one', 'true', 'not', 'altogether', 'tried', 'Jane', 'turning', 'completely', 'enjoy', 'own', 'life', 'finally', 'suitable', 'time', 'herself', 'greatly', 'developed', 'past', 'ten', 'years', 'decision', 'Complicated']",N/A

I'm reminded of a few other films whose names escape me, but in reality a relatively precious few other films as Hollywood tends to marginalize older stars when it comes to romantic roles.  Regardless, in most cases romantic comedies tend to succeed or fail based on the chemistry of the actors/characters and of course the story that puts the characters together.In terms of on-screen chemistry, Meryl Streep and Alec Baldwin seem to match up nicely enough with Streep also matching up reasonably well with Steve Martin.  The story that puts the pairings together revolves around the previously failed marriage of Streep and Baldwin's characters as they come together for a few life events for friends and members of their families.  We see Streep and Baldwin initially appearing as what seems to be a happy couple reminiscing over the relationship of a pair of their friends.  Quickly we find that they aren't the couple we thought they were and instead are exes that have come together for just a few moments.  Baldwin's character had moved on and married a younger woman (Lake Bell) while Streep had taken time to get herself together after the divorce.Over the relatively peppy 2 hours worth of movie running time viewers follow Streep as she finds herself possibly renewing her relationship with Baldwin while also potentially starting up a relationship with an incredibly neurotic Steve Martin.As a date night type film I'd guess that viewers of the female persuasion would enjoy the film more than most males would.  For me it was ok, but not much more than that, leaving me happy that it was a rental viewing rather than a purchase.  If I had a significant other that considered this one a must own for some reason I wouldn't mind having a copy in the video collection, but would probably hold out until the inevitable sale comes along.",3,Middle of the pack romantic comedy,1272585600,"04 30, 2010",2010,2032,"['Complicated', 'middle', 'pack', 'least', 'semi-romantic', 'comedy', 'primary', 'claim', 'fame', 'relationship', 'featured', 'one', 'more', 'mature', 'characters', ""'m"", 'reminded', 'few', 'other', 'films', 'names', 'escape', 'reality', 'relatively', 'precious', 'few', 'other', 'films', 'Hollywood', 'marginalize', 'older', 'stars', 'when', 'romantic', 'roles', 'Regardless', 'most', 'cases', 'romantic', 'comedies', 'tend', 'succeed', 'fail', 'based', 'chemistry', 'actors/characters', 'course', 'story', 'characters', 'together.In', 'terms', 'on-screen', 'chemistry', 'Meryl', 'Streep', 'Alec', 'Baldwin', 'seem', 'match', 'up', 'nicely', 'enough', 'Streep', 'also', 'matching', 'up', 'reasonably', 'well', 'Steve', 'Martin', 'story', 'pairings', 'together', 'previously', 'failed', 'marriage', 'Streep', 'Baldwin', 'characters', 'come', 'together', 'few', 'life', 'events', 'friends', 'members', 'families', 'see', 'Streep', 'Baldwin', 'initially', 'appearing', 'what', 'be', 'happy', 'couple', 'reminiscing', 'relationship', 'pair', 'friends', 'Quickly', 'find', 'are', ""n't"", 'couple', 'thought', 'were', 'instead', 'are', 'exes', 'have', 'come', 'together', 'just', 'few', 'moments', 'Baldwin', 'character', 'had', 'moved', 'married', 'younger', 'woman', 'Lake', 'Bell', 'Streep', 'had', 'taken', 'time', 'get', 'together', 'divorce.Over', 'relatively', 'peppy', '2', 'hours', 'worth', 'movie', 'running', 'time', 'viewers', 'follow', 'Streep', 'possibly', 'renewing', 'relationship', 'Baldwin', 'also', 'potentially', 'starting', 'up', 'relationship', 'incredibly', 'neurotic', 'Steve', 'Martin.As', 'date', 'night', 'type', 'film', ""'d"", 'guess', 'viewers', 'female', 'persuasion', 'would', 'enjoy', 'film', 'more', 'most', 'males', 'would', 'was', 'ok', 'not', 'much', 'more', 'leaving', 'happy', 'was', 'rental', 'viewing', 'rather', 'purchase', 'had', 'significant', 'other', 'considered', 'one', 'must', 'own', 'reason', 'would', ""n't"", 'mind', 'having', 'copy', 'video', 'collection', 'would', 'probably', 'hold', 'out', 'inevitable', 'sale', 'along']",N/A

I have seen enough 'Pretty Woman', '27 Dresses' type films to nearly dread them.  That was my initial reaction to this movie.  Sure, it's a little sleazy, with Meryl Streep having an affair with her own ex husband, and then there is Steve Martin's character.  For adults, this is not material or subjects that do not happen.  If this were a film about a 20'ish couple, or a teen film (with the same content), they would not work.  I think that the cast of Baldwin, Martin and Streep make it work.  At the stage of life the adults find themselves, the children have to just let things happen.  After all, what can they say?  They are adults, and mom and dad!The film is surprisingly honest about relationships and life.  We make mistakes, grow up and move on.  The characters in this film do that.  Even the humor is not forced here.  No fart jokes, no body parts hanging out, except the laptop cam shot of Baldwin which was very funny!All things considered. This film is very good, and is recommended for those 20 and over.

1291943,A1Z8HAH2FJAATJ,B002VECM1S,TreeDogRain,"[3, 6]","....this movie clonks along, with predictable...well, complications.The surface glamour distracts from the clonking sensation. This movie is really a fantasy about all the trappings of 97th-percentile net worth: the stunning, multi-acre, lovingly and tastefully appointed Montecito ($$$$) home to which Meryl's character has repaired after the blow of her divorce. The sub-plot involving a home addition and a dream kitchen, when the kitchen she already has would be a dream for most of us. (Note the precise dent in the refrigerator door, to suggest it really isn't so dreamy). The almost-as-awesome nearby home owned by her mid-twenties daughter and her fiancee (Krasinski, who gives this material a solid and only occasionally over-the-top shot). It's all about surfaces, really: the Porches and Audis and Priuses for the kids, the expensive hotels, the Christian Louboutin shoes; the high-gloss beauty of every single material thing, down to the croissants.It is always a joy to watch Streep. The director had her spinning a little too hard in some scenes -- lots and lots of head-back hilarity -- but she can reliably wring moments of comic delight and sincerity even out of insincere material like this. Alec Baldwin plays his role with less suppressed glee than he offers on 30 Rock, but the powerful, rich, snarky, entitled, and thus somehow sexy heart of his character is similar. So are the fabulous eyes, which he flashes to particular effect here. But Steve Martin was not the right pick for this role. His character was supposed to be low-key but ardent, and here Martin is neither. His face and eyes telegraph so very little that, rather than low-key, he seems stupefied with boredom, even when he's grinning in that maniacal, old-school Steve Martin way later on.In this rating system, with zero stars not possible, one star must mean 'the worst.' This is better than that, thanks again largely to Streep and Baldwin, with a good assist by Krasinski, and with all the things we'd come to expect from a filmmaker of this director's experience. But it is also escapism without real heart; funny in certain moments, but mechanical and, at cringe-worthy moments, pretty vapid. Worst of all for a romantic comedy, it's really not much of either.",2,Like a Square Wheel....,1276387200,"06 13, 2010",2010,2255,"['.this', 'movie', 'clonks', 'predictable', 'well', 'complications.The', 'surface', 'glamour', 'distracts', 'clonking', 'sensation', 'movie', 'really', 'fantasy', 'trappings', '97th-percentile', 'net', 'worth', 'stunning', 'multi-acre', 'lovingly', 'tastefully', 'appointed', 'Montecito', 'home', 'Meryl', 'character', 'repaired', 'blow', 'divorce', 'sub-plot', 'involving', 'home', 'addition', 'dream', 'kitchen', 'when', 'kitchen', 'already', 'would', 'be', 'dream', 'most', 'Note', 'precise', 'dent', 'refrigerator', 'door', 'suggest', 'really', ""n't"", 'so', 'dreamy', 'almost-as-awesome', 'nearby', 'home', 'owned', 'mid-twenties', 'daughter', 'fiancee', 'Krasinski', 'who', 'material', 'solid', 'only', 'occasionally', 'over-the-top', 'shot', 'surfaces', 'really', 'Porches', 'Audis', 'Priuses', 'kids', 'expensive', 'hotels', 'Christian', 'Louboutin', 'shoes', 'high-gloss', 'beauty', 'single', 'material', 'thing', 'down', 'croissants.It', 'always', 'joy', 'watch', 'Streep', 'director', 'had', 'spinning', 'little', 'too', 'hard', 'scenes', 'lots', 'lots', 'head-back', 'hilarity', 'can', 'reliably', 'wring', 'moments', 'comic', 'delight', 'sincerity', 'even', 'insincere', 'material', 'Alec', 'Baldwin', 'role', 'less', 'suppressed', 'glee', '30', 'Rock', 'powerful', 'rich', 'snarky', 'entitled', 'thus', 'somehow', 'sexy', 'heart', 'character', 'similar', 'are', 'fabulous', 'eyes', 'particular', 'effect', 'here', 'Steve', 'Martin', 'was', 'not', 'right', 'pick', 'role', 'character', 'was', 'supposed', 'be', 'low-key', 'ardent', 'here', 'Martin', 'face', 'eyes', 'telegraph', 'so', 'very', 'little', 'rather', 'low-key', 'stupefied', 'boredom', 'even', 'when', 'grinning', 'maniacal', 'old-school', 'Steve', 'Martin', 'way', 'later', 'rating', 'system', 'zero', 'stars', 'not', 'possible', 'one', 'star', 'must', 'mean', ""'the"", 'worst', 'better', 'thanks', 'again', 'largely', 'Streep', 'Baldwin', 'good', 'assist', 'Krasinski', 'things', ""'d"", 'come', 'expect', 'filmmaker', 'director', 'experience', 'also', 'escapism', 'real', 'heart', 'funny', 'certain', 'moments', 'mechanical', 'cringe-worthy', 'moments', 'pretty', 'vapid', 'Worst', 'romantic', 'comedy', 'really', 'not', 'much']",N/A

They fall in love with each other after attending their son's graduation. Not exactly an unusual or complicated thing, you might say. What makes things complicated is Jake has already remarried, and nice and gentle Adam (Steve Martin) is romantically attracted to Jane.For those who have seen Nancy Meyers' films - ""The Parent Trap,"" ""What Women Want,"" ""Something's Gotta Give,"" and ""The Holiday"" - her latest comedy drama is nothing surprising. Her films always begin with an interesting premise while the storyline itself remains rather straightforward and we can sense where the story is going. In fact, the plotline itself is not very complicated.One thing is promised in her films: impressive cast that never disappoints. The actors are all having fun and it is great to see them having a good time. It is nice to see Steve Martin doing something different; it is also nice to see Alec Baldwin doing ""American Pie""-like silly joke. As for Meryl Streep, well, she is always great. Among the younger actors John Krasinski is really funny as very likeable Harley, who witnesses the ""affair"" of Jake and Jane. This is some feat, considering the stars he is with.In short, Nancy Meyers plays it safe. That is not a bad thing. The film is fun to watch and some of the set-pieces are hilarious, but having enjoyed all the films she had directed, I feel I want to see something different, not necessarily edgy, but something unpredictable, in her next film.",3,"(3.5 STARS) It's Fun, Not That Complicated Though",1270252800,"04 3, 2010",2010,1536,"['divorced', 'couple', 'Jane', 'Meryl', 'Streep', 'Jake', 'Alec', 'Baldwin', 'fall', 'love', 'again', 'fall', 'love', 'other', 'attending', 'son', 'graduation', 'Not', 'exactly', 'unusual', 'complicated', 'thing', 'might', 'say', 'What', 'things', 'complicated', 'Jake', 'already', 'remarried', 'nice', 'gentle', 'Adam', 'Steve', 'Martin', 'romantically', 'attracted', 'Jane.For', 'who', 'have', 'seen', 'Nancy', 'Meyers', 'films', 'Parent', 'Trap', 'What', 'Women', 'Want', 'Something', 'Got', 'ta', 'Give', 'Holiday', 'latest', 'comedy', 'drama', 'nothing', 'surprising', 'films', 'always', 'begin', 'interesting', 'premise', 'storyline', 'rather', 'straightforward', 'can', 'sense', 'where', 'story', 'going', 'fact', 'plotline', 'not', 'very', 'complicated.One', 'thing', 'promised', 'films', 'impressive', 'cast', 'never', 'actors', 'are', 'having', 'fun', 'great', 'see', 'having', 'good', 'time', 'nice', 'see', 'Steve', 'Martin', 'doing', 'something', 'different', 'also', 'nice', 'see', 'Alec', 'Baldwin', 'doing', 'American', 'Pie', '-like', 'silly', 'joke', 'Meryl', 'Streep', 'well', 'always', 'great', 'younger', 'actors', 'John', 'Krasinski', 'really', 'funny', 'very', 'likeable', 'Harley', 'who', 'affair', 'Jake', 'Jane', 'feat', 'considering', 'stars', 'with.In', 'short', 'Nancy', 'Meyers', 'safe', 'not', 'bad', 'thing', 'film', 'fun', 'watch', 'set-pieces', 'are', 'hilarious', 'having', 'enjoyed', 'films', 'had', 'directed', 'feel', 'want', 'see', 'something', 'different', 'not', 'necessarily', 'edgy', 'something', 'unpredictable', 'next', 'film']",N/A
1291948,A18GP1PWVTKXQQ,B002VECM1S,Turfseer,"[1, 1]","*** This review may contain spoilers ***'It's Complicated's clever opening scene introduces us to Jane and Jake who are attending an anniversary party for old friends and appear to be married. But soon Jake is joined by his sexy younger wife, Agness, and we realize Jane is the odd woman out. To make matters worse, her youngest daughter (Jane has four grown children) is now moving out of the nest and Jane is all alone in the house. Her children are concerned for her but she reassures them that she'll be fine. Jane pours herself into her work and when the head of the architectural firm comes by with new blueprints for an addition to Jane's house, she's not listening when he introduces her to Adam who actually is the project manager, responsible for all the new designs. Finally, Jane meets with a bunch of her lady friends who urge her to start dating again.The break into 'Act 2' occurs when Jane and Jake are booked in at the same hotel to attend their youngest son's graduation from college. When Jake's hyperactive son from his second marriage takes ill, Jake finds himself at the hotel alone. The estranged couple suddenly find themselves opening up after all these years over a series of drinks. Streep and Baldwin are at the top of their game as they become more and more inebriated, leading to their first sexual encounter since their divorce. We see the aftermath of said encounter with Jake admitting that he had a great time but with Jane expressing her doubts (not to mention barfing in the bathroom after having one too many). Note how Streep is hunched over the toilet bowl and we suddenly cut to the college commencement, a great little edit. I also loved how the sensitivity of the characters are brought out--Jane whistles as the youngest son appears in his cap and gown but suddenly bursts into tears (with Jake glancing at her); later it's Jake's turn to get all sensitive while eating dinner with Jane and all the children. He praises Jane and admits that he wasn't there emotionally for the kids. He gets all misty-eyed but the son urges him to 'pull himself together'. Jake caresses Jane with his foot under the table, expressing his continued interest in her. The children make it harder for Jane by admitting that it's so nice to have the family all together again.After the graduation is over, Jane fails to respond to Jake's emails so he comes over to her house and begins making a pitch for her again. He's full of witty lines such as ""life is short"" and ""people in nursing homes with plants live longer"" and she responds by stating that she never realized what a good lawyer he was. More witty lines and situations: Jake says this is ""very French of us""; Jane reveals to her friends she's having an 'affair' with ""Agness Adler's husband""--and her friends squeal with delight! At first the affair has a positive effect on Jane's mood; an employee asks ""what did you do to your hair"" and she orders him to ""change the breakfast menu"".Things eventually begin to go sour when Jake gets jealous over Jane's interest in Adam. Before you know it, Jake is spying on Jane and Adam as they have an innocent date at Jane's home. Perhaps the weakest part of the movie is Steven Martin's character. He's such a dour, wussy guy due to his inability to get over his divorce that wonders what Jane sees in him at all. Most of the scenes of Jane and Adam's burgeoning romance are slow-moving until things pick up when the two end up getting stoned on marijuana at son Luke's graduation party. Agness notes that Jake and Jane are unusually close as they dance together and this leads to the second act crisis where Jake splits up with his second wife. Interspersed between the graduation party scene and Jake showing up at Jane's home, begging to be taken back by her, is that unnecessary, long-winded encounter between Jane and Adam, preparing a batch of chocolate croissants.Things get back on track with Jake's revelation that he's left Agness and the children are all in tears as they can see their father is cracking up. They pressure Jane into letting their father stay over, even though she knows it's not a good idea. Note the wonderful transition between Jake in tears, the kids' emotional reaction and Jake at the dinner table, completely comfortable in the family setting, gorging himself on a sumptuous meal.I found the scene leading to the climax, where Jake parades himself butt naked in front of Jane's laptop, thus temporarily shattering Adam's dreams of a relationship with Jane, to be a bit over the top. But everything after that works oh so well. Jane and Jake's children reaction after they learn of their parents' affair is perfect: they all drive off, leaving Jane staring up at the rustling leaves in the trees, as she falls asleep on the couch. And then Jane pulls herself together the next and goes over tor reassure her children that she needed to ""experiment"" to see if there was any 'spark' left between her and Jake. She reveals the spark isn't there anymore and with her honesty with the children, Jane restores the trust between them and herself.The conclusion is poignant: Jake is waiting for Jane back at her home and they have one last conversation on the swing. Jane sums it all up when she acknowledges that they both ""blew it the first time around"". Jake finally faces the reality that Jane has moved on. The heartfelt theme of the movie becomes manifest: in order to grow, people sometimes must change, which also may involve some kind of loss.",4,"Moving, mature exploration of ex-couples' second shot

Meryl Streep, sorry to say, is showing her age, and Alex Baldwin, just can't act.  He broods and effects his puppy dog eyes to show emotion.  Plus, with his gut, he's just plain gross.  The story got all mixes up as well, and the characters were hardly sympathetic.  Like why the Streep character need to put an addition to an otherwise lovely house?  And what was wrong with her damned kitchen!  Ultimately, it was the story about an affair - although the only one really having an affair was the Baldwin character since he was married to the cliched younger woman and Meryl had never remarried.  And why, after ten years did he feel the need to come back to her.  Where the hell was he all those years?  Dumb.  Steve Martin played it straight, and that did not suit him.

1291954,A1POFVVXUZR3IQ,B002VECM1S,Z Hayes,"[2, 2]","The romantic comedy genre often suffers from trite plots and insipid dialogue, not to mention exaggerated acting. ""It's Complicated"" may not be the most original romantic comedy in terms of plot, but what elevates it above an average romantic comedy is the excellent casting. Veteran actress Meryl Streep plays successful bakery owner Jane who has been divorced from her ex, Jake (played by Alec Baldwin) for the past 10 years. The divorce was initially quite acrimonious, as Jake left Jane for a younger woman and their three children, all grown up, have gotten used to the idea of their parents being divorced, to the extent that the family gets along quite well in the present.Jake is under pressure from his young wife to start a family, and reluctantly goes to a fertility clinic. Meanwhile, Jane is planning an addition to her house, and the project is overseen by architect Adam (played by Steve Martin). When the family gets together for the youngest son's graduation from college, Jake and Jane end up having an affair and this triggers all sorts of confused feelings in Jane - why is she doing this? Is she not over Jake, is it revenge, or is she just lonely? Meryl Streep plays her character credibly to the extent that the viewer can truly empathize with her predicament. She lends Jane an air of vulnerability, whilst also imbuing her with strength and courage when she needs to make the right decision. This is especially significant when Adam begins to develop feelings for Jane and a close bond forms between them, though Jake is also obviously still in love with Jane. What is a woman to do?Alec Baldwin plays his role as the emotionally immature Jake with panache, and the credible chemistry with Meryl Streep makes their scenes together truly a pleasure to watch, and entertaining to say the least. I felt that Steve Martin did not share this strong chemistry with Streep, and his role appeared overshadowed by the two leads. A stand-out performance worth mentioning here is the role of Harley (the soon to be son-in-law) played by John Krasinski. His comic timing is perfect and subtly played, especially in the scenes where he discovers to his horror, that his divorced soon-to-be father-in-law and mother-in-law are having an affair. Poor Harley is then left with the unenviable task of pretending he does not know anything whilst trying to keep the situation under control.
