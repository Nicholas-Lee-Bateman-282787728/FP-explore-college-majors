This movie is filled with hope and inspiration. Most deffinately a movie parents can feel comfortable showing to their younger children. It is one of the best baseball movies I've seen in many years.

I would love to give this movie a positive review but with a clear conscience I cannot. Of course it is a good movie compared to all the trash out there. If you are comparing it to other Christian movies we have seen, it is very disappointing. Poor acting, disjointed storyline, and very uninspiring to my family. Maybe others enjoyed it but we did not. My wife and daughter thought it was terrible. She is giving it to Goodwill. I want to support Christian movies but I feel like this was a total waste of money. Of course, this is only our opinion.

I personally feel that if we rate movies G, PG, R, X and so on, why not add a new category for religion?  You could have CH for Christian, CA for Catholic, HI for Hindu, MU for Muslim... and so on!  Everybody wins!  Now you can rent the movie that matches your own religious beliefs instead of being surprised as the wolf removes a layer of clothing scene-by-scene!
