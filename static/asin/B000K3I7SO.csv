If you follow the basic 'law's' of attraction you will see why this movie is such a big deal.  Ignore the people that tell you it's a scam and watch it.  Judge it for yourself as I did.  All those that laughed at it are still where they were then and I've moved forward to better things.,5,A great movie for all times,1394755200,"03 14, 2014",2014,376,"[""'ve"", 'read', 'book', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'movie', 'movie', 'so', 'much', 'better', 'book', 'follow', 'basic', ""'law"", 'attraction', 'will', 'see', 'why', 'movie', 'big', 'deal', 'Ignore', 'people', 'tell', 'scam', 'watch', 'Judge', 'did', 'laughed', 'are', 'still', 'where', 'were', 'then', ""'ve"", 'moved', 'forward', 'better', 'things']",N/A
1030574,A3N95R1VKWROWF,B000K3I7SO,Christopher Schwinger,"[0, 1]","(Just so you know, I borrowed this instead of buying it. Good thing, too: it would have been a waste of money.) I can hardly believe people of intelligence who are the talking heads on ""The Secret"" program actually believe the things they're saying! Among the idiotic claims are:1. Negative thoughts are always dangerous.2. Being ""against"" something makes more of that something happen, while being ""for"" something makes it ABSOLUTELY happen.3. Whatever you desire can come true if you just believe it can and put yourself in a state of mind to make it happen.4. If you get what you want, you will be happy and stay happy.5. God is energy, and so we are ""the universe becoming more conscious of itself"". (If everything is God, then where did evil come from? That's only one of the issues I find with this philosophical claim.)6. Everyone's different dreams of what they want life to be like can coexist harmoniously. (Where does the Third Reich come into that picture? Where do other evil agendas?)The few kernels of truth it has are swallowed up in a bunch of nonsense about impulsive living, getting whatever you want just because you choose to believe it's already yours, bla bla bla. The few kernels of truth are quantum physics-based, and for most people, would be hard to sort out from the claptrap. Here's what I have concluded is actually legit about its philosophy:1. Taking time to form ideas (thoughts associated with images and feelings) about your goals is very important for shaping your destiny--to the extent you actually can, which the movie absurdly says is 100% in your control.2. Don't focus on what you don't want as much as on what you want instead. (Where the movie stupidly gets it wrong is in claiming that bad things keep happening because people talk about being anti-terrorism and anti-war and anti-drugs. It's not because of the idea ""anti-war"" that war continues!!) There is some truth to one idea it presents, though, which is that if you present your candidate just as standing against the other candidate's positions, your candidate tends to lose. The Republican Party today is mostly just anti-Obama rather than presenting its own vision and explaining why it's better than Obama's, and I'm sure that's part of why it's not effective at getting the changes it wants. But it's ridiculous to think, like the movie's philosophy, that being ""anti-slavery"" instead of ""pro-freedom"" is why there's so much ""negative energy"" and conflict, as if the abolitionists could have prevented the Civil War by being ""pro-freedom"". They already were pro-freedom, or else they'd not have done the Underground Railroad!!3. Don't focus on something you want being hard to achieve. If you focus on the difficulty, it diminishes your motivation and also diminishes your desire. The strength of your desire makes the fulfillment of it more likely--but again, NOT a guarantee, while the movie claims it is an 100% reliable thing.4. Focus on feeling good about your dream, taking time to feel the feelings associated with having what you want. Again, the stupid movie claims it's a certainty you'll get what you want. The truth is that it is a healthy psychological exercise to keep you hopeful about the future, and keeps you open to new ways of making that future a reality, but there are many factors which can keep it from coming true. The movie is very selective in its examples, to try to say it's all your own doing. I can think of many examples where people who dream of a certain kind of life don't get that, because of a child getting run over by a car or a wife not being able to conceive, and more. It is hard for me to believe this doesn't even cross the minds of the many talking heads on this pseudo-scientific documentary! Their view lines up with Christian Science that your mind is in total control over your health.Then they have the audacity to say their teachings line up with the Bible and Buddha about being connected to the energy force of the universe and about what makes people happy, apparently unaware that the Apostle Paul in the Bible was happy AND suffering because he was looking to the hope of life after death, and unaware that Buddhism extols suffering as the path to happiness. It's dishonest about both religions by leaving suffering out of the picture. It also, not surprisingly, neglects the Apostle Paul's account of a ""thorn in the flesh"" in 2 Corinthians, which he wanted to eliminate but couldn't, a physical ailment which was causing him lots of trouble. Yet he had a positive attitude about ""suffering for Christ""--but couldn't eliminate his ailment through positive thinking. ""The Secret"" doesn't present any such complexity. It also makes it sound like material and relationship gain is what life is all about, what will ultimately satisfy: it ignores the history of the Hollywood movie business, which proves that those people have sordid and unhappy lives as a rule, in spite of having material and relationship gain. The REAL ""Secret"" is how to keep a relationship healthy, but that's not mentioned EVEN ONCE!It also claims that people who have had wealth throughout history got it because they focused on getting what they wanted, which is horribly disrespectful to the memory of those who have suffered throughout history. It claims no one but you yourself can determine your destiny or tell you what to do, which means justice is of your own making. That means the obscenely powerful kings of old like Louis XIV were self-made individuals who are accountable to no one but themselves, while the paupers had only themselves to blame and were accountable to the king because they focused on the negative things about their lives. ""The Secret"" is a disrespect to their memory.One of the most glaring idiocies of ""The Secret"" is that they still don't have an answer for death. Focusing on the thought ""I want to live"" instead of ""I don't want to die"" won't keep you from eventually dying. It also has no explanation for evil, and says getting money and impulsive buying are good things and that if you just trust it will work out, you can act recklessly and be happy. You can be happy without being responsible, suffering, or sacrificing. WHAT?!With only 4 kernels of truth in the entire thing, and far more absurd claims, I wish I could give it HALF a star. Notice that even in the 4 kernels, I kept having to correct how ""The Secret"" twisted them.",1,"Only 25% legit, 75% disgusting drivel",1403913600,"06 28, 2014",2014,6408,"['Just', 'so', 'know',

1030580,A1JV4QKTEB7QBL,B000K3I7SO,"Diana F. Von Behren ""reneofc""","[2, 4]","For those of us who have been around for a while, ""The Secret"" really isn't much of a secret.  Instead it is a compendium of positive thoughts with some ersatz quantum physics backing to make its whole premise seem scientific rather than new age.I do buy Ms Byrne's initial thinking; being depressed about life's miseries does cause inertia that leads to a search within oneself.  I liken her quest for the so-called truth akin to thoughts that I myself had when my mother passed away over ten years ago.  Feeling one's mortality leads to the bigger question of `what's it all about, anyway?' and this focus can either enlighten or demoralize.  In Ms Byrne's case it seems to have facilitated a way for her to subsidize her bank account substantially.  Like most inherently healthy people, she chose to anesthetize the bad feelings of dread, doubt and fear by substituting them with sensations that moved her forward in life.  Good for her and if it helps to put you on a positive track, why not?Sadly, positive doesn't begin to describe how most people react to life. Complaining now qualifies as a national pastime.  On average, I can honestly say that the majority of people I have met use their negative past experiences to hover over their lives and mark their futures with an all-encompassing shadow that puts Job to shame and keeps all those psychoanalysts in their million dollar homes and foreign cars.  What good does looking into the past do?  Learning from or identifying one's source of pain doesn't mean that said angst becomes magically diminished; the only way to assuage anxiety entails a concentration on some other constructive activity.  Wallowing and worrying that history will repeat itself just doesn't keep the half glass full enough to quench our parched throats.And that is what it really is all about--keeping the glass half full rather than empty with a simple and effective philosophical shift.  Forgive the hackneyed philosophy, but all the great minds reiterate this same basic idea in a variety of ways--just read the quotations that regal each of ""The Secret's"" main segments and forget about the trendy Da Vinci Code lead-in designed to make you think that the term ""Secret"" has anything to do with conspiracy theories and the like rather than a direct way of asking the winners of this world what the `secret' to their success entailed.  All the victors chant the same mantra: think positive thoughts that make you feel good and goal realization will follow.Byrne cleverly assembles her panel of experts to reflect successful, happy entrepreneurial types that live lives about which most people dream.  In particular,  Jack Canfield's (author of the Chicken Soup for the Soul series ) remarks resonate simply because his demeanor suggests a very happy camper that eagerly and willingly relates his tale of accomplishment as an average everyman who envisioned personal triumph and achieved it by acting on a good idea.  Some of the other panel members did not register as highly on my recognition scale; many of them I know only because of their appearance en masse on the Oprah Winfrey segment regarding the film.My beefs with this presentation have little to do with the actual premise.  I can find little fault with something so elementary and positive.  Simple thinking to me always seems the most profound; Christ himself advised in his enigmatic way, `to seek and ye shall find.'  Some may say that the film focuses on the acquisition of money or rather silly materialistic targets, but if you look beyond the actual goals and realize that the filmmaker looks only to illustrate common examples of such desires, you can see beyond the triviality and bundle all such ends, great and small, as attainable according to the power of positive thinking or as defined in the film as ""the law of attraction.""  Whether or not the ""law of attraction' has anything to do with quantum physics, I have not expertise with which to comment.  Most likely the idea of the quantum world and the mind updates the timelessness of the original premise for the newer audience of this century.Some will say that the film's idea of becoming a mini-god in one's own sphere of influence or mini-universe suggests the retirement or denial of God.  I don't believe that this is the film's intent.  More probably, the emphasis on self widens the sphere of influence of the film itself---the idea then becomes more appealing and marketable to believers and non-believers alike.Bottom line?  Does ""The Secret"" really relate a true secret?  For the most part, no.  Its Earl Nightingale's ""Strangest Secret"" rebundled to reflect a world that needs scientific validity for even the simplest thoughts.  Nevertheless, I will recommend it as it does promote good conversation afterwards, bringing into the light issues both profound and mundane.Diana Faillace Von Behren""reneofc""",3,Back to

Im not gonna lie to you though its sum mental and emotional work your gonna have to do to apply the secret.  It takes more then just wishing on a star.  You much study, put the mental work in, change your outlook on life, apply positive feedback to every occurance no matter how bad or indifferent, and give back to the community and others.  Not just family and friends but people u may not even know.  And always always give thanks and be grateful for everything in your life!

We are always drawing to us that which we are predominantly thinking. This isn't some ""pie-in-the-sky"" notion, this is the Truth. Jesus the Master Teacher said, ""It is done unto you as you believe...""In just eight simple words, Jesus summed up life for each and every one of us and this incredible movie gets us to remember that each one of us ""creates our reality"" with our thoughts, our feelings, and the images that we are allowing ourselves to predominantly focus upon. Of course, we do not actually ""create"" reality but our interpretations of what comes into our lives can ""bless"" us or ""curse"" us.Does this DVD tell us anything new? I hate to break it to you, but there is ""nothing new under the sun"". But maybe...just maybe....we need to apply that which we thought we ""knew"". I've been at this metaphysical/spiritual stuff for almost twenty years now and I am constantly amazed at the new insights I continuously receive from those things I once thought I ""knew"".There will be the ""naysayers"" who say that this DVD is a rip off, but you gotta ask yourself, how many of these people have put this stuff into practice? Yeah, sure, it's easy to change your thoughts --- but keeping them changed, that's the tricky part. We have all been hypnotized to a certain degree about how things are in the world, but the bottom line is that our defintion of reality is not so much a definition of how it really is as much as it is a definition of how we are.I've watched this movie over sixty times, I've given workshops based on it, I recommend it to anyone who has the ears to hear, the eyes to see, and the spirit willing enough. In and of itself, this movie will not change your life, only you can do that, but this movie will definitely give you those ""glimpses"" of Truth that when persistently and consistently and willingly applied can and will change your life for the better.As Ralph Waldo Emerson once said, ""All of life is an experiment."" Be willing to redirect your focus, be willing to let go of old beliefs and form new ones, be willing to be more than you ever thought you could and life will reward you with the greatest reward you could ever hope to receive; a well-lived life.Peace and Blessings to you all.john 'the Light"" coach",5,Even Now....,1170201600,"01 31, 2007",2007,2357,"['Whether', 'not', 'believe', 'Law', 'Attraction', 'are', 'always', 'using', 'are', 'using', 'now', 'moment', 'are', 'always', 'drawing', 'are', 'predominantly', 'thinking', ""n't"", 'pie-in-the-sky', 'notion', 'Truth', 'Jesus', 'Master', 'Teacher', 'said', 'done', 'unto', 'believe', 'just', 'eight', 'simple', 'words', 'Jesus', 'summed', 'up', 'life', 'one', 'incredible', 'movie', 'remember', 'one', 'reality', 'thoughts', 'feelings', 'images', 'are', 'allowing', 'predominantly', 'focus', 'course', 'do', 'not', 'actually', 'create', 'reality', 'interpretations', 'what', 'lives', 'can', 'bless', 'curse', 'us.Does', 'DVD', 'tell', 'anything', 'new', 'hate', 'break', 'nothing', 'new', 'sun', 'maybe', 'just', 'maybe', '.we', 'need', 'apply', 'thought', 'knew', ""'ve"", 'been', 'metaphysical/spiritual', 'stuff', 'almost', 'twenty', 'years', 'now', 'am', 'constantly', 'amazed', 'new', 'insights', 'continuously', 'receive', 'things', 'once', 'thought', 'knew', 'will', 'be', 'naysayers', 'who', 'say', 'DVD', 'rip', 'got', 'ta', 'ask', 'how', 'many', 'people', 'have', 'put', 'stuff', 'practice', 'Yeah', 'sure', 'easy', 'change', 'thoughts', 'keeping', 'changed', 'tricky', 'part', 'have', 'been', 'hypnotized', 'certain', 'degree', 'how', 'things', 'are', 'world', 'bottom', 'line', 'defintion', 'reality', 'not', 'so', 'much', 'definition', 'how', 'really', 'as', 'much', 'definition', 'how', 'are.I', ""'ve"", 'watched', 'movie', 'sixty', 'times', ""'ve"", 'given', 'workshops', 'based', 'recommend', 'anyone', 'who', 'ears', 'hear', 'eyes', 'see', 'spirit', 'willing', 'enough', 'movie', 'will', 'not', 'change', 'life', 'only', 'can', 'do', 'movie', 'will', 'definitely', 'give', 'glimpses', 'Truth', 'when', 'persistently', 'consistently', 'willingly', 'applied', 'can', 'will', 'change', 'life', 'better.As', 'Ralph', 'Waldo', 'Emerson', 'once', 'said', 'life', 'experiment', 'Be', 'willing', 'redirect', 'focus', 'be', 'willing', 'let', 'go', 'old', 'beliefs', 'form', 'new', 'ones', 'be', 'willing', 'be', 'more', 'ever', 'thought', 'could', 'life', 'will', 'reward', 'greatest', 'reward', 'could', 'ever', 'hope', 'receive', 'well-lived', 'life.Peace', 'Blessings', 'all.john', 'Light', 'coach']",N/A

1030592,A3FY3H6F4249E0,B000K3I7SO,Kathy W,"[4, 8]","This is not a movie or an adventure story.  It is like mini interviews.  Subject matter experts give you their takes on ""The Secret"".  One of them gives you a concept, explains it, then each of several experts discuss it with you and explain the ""how to"".  I give it 5 stars for its subject matter content and for, what I believe to be, its truth and accuracy.With that said, ""The Secret"" is about accessing the Universal Law of Attraction (and the manifestation of Abundance).  Step-by-step, this video breaks it down in language and comparisons that are easy to understand.  The quick and dirty explanation is that you are as you perceive.  If you can really believe, remove all doubt, put emotion into the belief, focus intensely on what you want, and remove negativity from within yourself, you can likely achieve whatever you really want.  The video gives you more details on how to do it.If you find it difficult to believe that you are what you perceive/believe/expect, break the concept down simplistically.  You get up today and spill coffee on yourself, as you are rushing to get out of the house.  You get angry, and then you rip your shirt trying to hurry up and pull it off.  Now you're really aggitated and thinking ""what else can go wrong?""  and ""what a day THIS is going to be!""  You just set yourself up for failure and your whole day will probably be rotten because you set the expectation that it will be.  Trust me, you WILL try to validate your own expectation that you have developed and you will draw negative happenings and people to you.  Now flip the scenario and don't even start off late, rushing and angry. Be peaceful, happy, thankful for everything and see how your day goes.  Smile at everyone, no matter who it is. Remove all judgements because you don't like the fact that someone has a tatoo, or wears different clothing than you do. I could say a lot more, but you need to watch the DVD to get it.  You can also watch an argument escalate between to people to watch the Law of Attraction at work, especially 2 cars on the interstate. One gets angry, blows the horn, hollers at the other and it just continues to escalate. They are attracting the anger that neither really want, but by sending the negative energy out there, they are attracting it back to themselves. I have seen the Law of Attraction in effect too many times to dis-believe it, especially since I have been consciously aware of it.Of course, to clean yourself from the inside out, to remove all negative thoughts and emotions (hate, anger, jealousy, fear, envy, etc.), and to want something and really believe in achieving it BEFORE you have it--this is easier said than done. If it was so darned easy, everybody would be doing it. You need to actively practice gratitude, too, for what you already have.  (Right out of the DVD.  Not just me saying it.)Let's say you're a grouchy crone and you get all this money.  You are rolling in it. So, you decide you want somebody to share it with, so you can enjoy life (travel, sit by the fireplace, whatever). If you're a nasty grouchy person, what kind of partner do you think you're going to attract? One who loves you with his/her whole heart???  One who will stand by you, no matter what?  What if the money disappears? That's why you need to get YOURSELF in balance.  Because what you think about is what you attract! If you BEHAVE nasty, you THINK nasty, and you ATTRACT nasty!  Hence, the Law of Attraction. And the more energy/intensity/emotion you put into the nastiness, the more nastiness you receive from those around you. If you want to be surrounded by love, YOU must be loving to attract that love!  (Duh.  It's really a no-brainer, but people are writing about it and making millions.)The DVD also talks about how dis-ease manifests.  This topic alone could be priceless to you. Would you consider watching a video that might teach you how to never get sick again? Is it worth a try, even if you don't believe it's possible? Would you rather get seriously ill and then WORRY about it?  That will help, won't it?If you are interesting in changing your life for the better AND you are willing to put forth a constant every day effort to do so, the principles in this DVD will help you get started. There are tons of tips throughout the DVD and it addresses the tons of questions in your mind.

I started with the Secret CDs a couple of years ago and I leave them in my car and listen to them almost daily - sometimes for just a few minutes and sometimes longer (great if you commute).  At first, The Secret is a hard concept to understand, accept and apply. The basis of the Secret is that your thoughts determine how your life will unfold.  If you learn to control your thoughts, you can control how your life unfolds.  Really, it's the power of positive thinking - just taken a step further.  They talk a lot about the Laws of Attraction (which at first made me think of love - but it relates to everything) and about how like attracts like.  Positive things come to positive people - focus on the positive - determine what you really want out of this life (I continue to be amazed at how I can flip flop on this - and they talk about how flip flopping can cause nothing to happen - - because you are not sure, and not clear on what you want).  They talk about the Universe gives back to you what you primarily think/feel about.  How feelings are indicators of what you are thinking (which is true, you don't feel good when you are thinking bad thoughts).  I think this is where a lot of people get turned off...sounds ""hippyish"", for lack of a better description.  But for me, as a believer in God, it all makes perfect sense. The universe is designed to work on auto pilot...you get out of it what you put into it. They reference the bible and tons of other resources in the CDs and DVD (the DVD is the same as the CDs) - the concept that YOU create what happens in your life was not easy for me to understand - having been raised catholic believing that God determines your path - this was a new concept for me.  But eventually made perfect sense - God wants us to have free will and choice - so we choose how we are, which all begins with a thought, etc., and we pave our own path.  And it all begins with a simple thought - kind or malicious, fearful or not, positive or negative.  Charles Haanel gets into the fear ""factor"" a little more - you just dont realize how often and how much FEAR plays a part in your everyday life - - and what it's doing is blocking or holding back things from coming to you.  Just amazing stuff and it took me about a year to really be able to digest it all.  SO its been two years since I learned of the Secret and I started studying Charles Haanel (one of the resources/references in The Secret) about a year ago - and I can tell you that my life is VERY different now - personally, healthwise, financially, mentally, spiritually - I feel empowered and have experienced some really wonderful things as a result of having learned The Secret.  Once you get it, it's hard not to be enthusiastic.  So get the DVD and maybe the CD's too (!) and watch it through once and then watch it slowly over time (over and over) so you can really digest what they say. It's a self help concept taken to an entirely different level.",5,This is a great DVD.,1282780800,"08 26, 2010",2010,3033,"['already', 'own', 'DVD', 'bought', 'one', 'Aunt', 'who', 'been', 'ill', 'started', 'Secret', 'CDs', 'couple', 'years', 'leave', 'car', 'listen', 'almost', 'daily', 'sometimes', 'just', 'few', 'minutes', 'sometimes', 'longer', 'great', 'commute', 'first', 'Secret', 'hard', 'concept', 'understand', 'accept', 'apply', 'basis', 'Secret', 'thoughts', 'determine', 'how', 'life', 'will', 'unfold', 'learn', 'control', 'thoughts', 'can', 'control', 'how', 'life', 'unfolds', 'Really', 'power', 'positive', 'thinking', 'just', 'taken', 'step', 'further', 'talk', 'lot', 'Laws', 'Attraction', 'first', 'made', 'think', 'love', 'everything', 'how', 'like', 'attracts', 'Positive', 'things', 'come', 'positive', 'people', 'focus', 'positive', 'determine', 'what', 'really', 'want', 'life', 'continue', 'be', 'amazed', 'how', 'can', 'flip', 'flop', 'talk', 'how', 'flip', 'flopping', 'can', 'cause', 'nothing', 'happen', 'are', 'not', 'sure', 'not', 'clear', 'what', 'want', 'talk', 'Universe', 'back', 'what', 'primarily', 'think/feel', 'about', 'How', 'feelings', 'are', 'indicators', 'what', 'are', 'thinking', 'true', 'do', ""n't"", 'feel', 'good', 'when', 'are', 'thinking', 'bad', 'thoughts', 'think', 'where', 'lot', 'people', 'get', 'turned', 'off', 'hippyish', 'lack', 'better', 'description', 'believer', 'God', 'perfect', 'sense', 'universe', 'designed', 'work', 'auto', 'pilot', 'get', 'put', 'reference', 'bible', 'tons', 'other', 'resources', 'CDs', 'DVD', 'DVD', 'same', 'CDs', 'concept', 'YOU', 'create', 'what', 'life', 'was', 'not', 'easy', 'understand', 'having', 'been', 'raised', 'catholic', 'believing', 'God', 'path', 'was', 'new', 'concept', 'eventually', 'made', 'perfect', 'sense', 'God', 'have', 'free', 'will', 'choice', 'choose', 'how', 'are', 'thought', 'etc.', 'pave', 'own', 'path', 'simple', 'thought', 'kind', 'malicious', 'fearful', 'not', 'positive', 'negative', 'Charles', 'Haanel', 'fear', 'factor', 'little', 'more', 'just', 'dont', 'realize', 'how', 'often', 'how', 'much', 'FEAR', 'part', 'everyday', 'life', 'what', 'doing', 'blocking', 'holding', 'back', 'things', 'coming', 'Just', 'amazing', 'stuff', 'took', 'year', 'really', 'be', 'able', 'digest', 'been', 'two', 'years', 'learned', 'Secret', 'started', 'studying', 'Charles', 'Haanel', 'one', 'resources/references', 'Secret', 'year', 'ago', 'can', 'tell', 'life', 'VERY', 'different', 'now', 'personally', 'healthwise', 'financially', 'mentally', 'spiritually', 'feel', 'empowered', 'have', 'experienced', 'really', 'wonderful', 'things', 'result', 'having', 'learned', 'Secret', 'Once', 'get', 'hard', 'not', 'be', 'enthusiastic', 'So', 'get', 'DVD', 'maybe', 'CD', 'too', 'watch', 'once', 'then', 'watch', 'slowly', 'time', 'over', 'can', 'really', 'digest', 'what', 'say', 'self', 'help', 'concept', 'taken', 'entirely', 'different', 'level']",N/A

Throughout the entire film, we kept waiting for a magic word that never came:WORK.Here's an example in the film:A boy wants a bicycle.  He cuts out a picture of it, strokes it, gazes at it adoringly and smiles.  That's all.  He doesn't get a paper route or do extra chores to earn money; he just sits around and wishes.  He opens the door one morning and Voila! There is the bicycle, flanked by the smiling grandfather who had purchased it for him.  Now, I'm thinking that this grandfather sees the kid mooning about for a bike (probably to the extent that he NEGLECTS his chores, as it never shows him doing anything to earn the bike) and he indulges the kid with the bike of his dreams.  Cool, man. So the lesson here is...sit around on your duff and wish for something you could probably earn yourself until someone else does it for you?  Well, looking at our country's vast entitlement system, I guess it works.The book also seems to contradict itself.  It says one can't control others, one can only control oneself.  However, if we are putting forth those mellow yellow vibes into the universe to snag ourselves a BMW, someone else is going to have to come through for us, since we're obviously too busy downloading our order from the Great Cosmic Catalogue  (""the universe is a catalogue"" was actually mentioned in the film) to actually...I don't know...WORK for it. Someone has to foot the bill. Who will that be?  Taxpayers and those family members everyone else sponges off of.  Yep, place your order with the Cosmos.  We're happy to serve you.In the film, there was this hapless loser who keeps going to his mailbox and finding bills upon bills upon bills and he has the nerve to look surprised.  He's now in major debt, sinking like the Titanic.  The narrator solemnly intones that this individual is ""attracting"" bills and debt to him (yeah, credit cards will do that) and that all this poor schmuck needs to do is to visualize checks coming into his mailbox.  The Schmuck does and the checks miraculously appear in his mailbox (it never mentions that he worked for them). Visualizing wealth and prosperity is fine, but I highly recommend that one cuts up his credit card to make it happen.The book says that ANYTHING you want you can have just by the ""Ask-Believe-Receive"" formula. However, if one believes in God, they know He isn't always as accommodating as we would like, for our own good. If we want something that is going to be detrimental to our spiritual health, God will refuse us. Let's face it, even the most intellectual of us are too stupid to always know what is good for us.There is some good advice in this book.  To be thankful for what one has and in doing so, one will bring in more positivity to their lives. I believe that. To visualize and dream and feel like you already have that object of desire. I believe that, also.  That ""like attracts like.""  Amen to that.But let's not leave ""work"" out of the equation.

First of all, The Secret is hardly a secret, rather a slap in the face of thoughtful discourse on a subject that's been debated for centuries. I rented it based on the enthusiastic recommendations from co-workers, but mostly because I was looking for a cohesive and in-depth exploration of ideas that basically I buy in to.  Instead, what I got were talking head ""experts"" that include ""visionary,"" ""metaphysician"" ""life coach,"" mystery authors, and a quantum physics guy or two who might be brilliant, but are notoriously nutjobs in a controversial field.  Since this is such a telling, critical point, and that there are a couple of thousand reviews to wade through and you might miss it, here is a list of presenters from another reviewer, who got it from the IMDB:John Assaraf - ""life"" coachMichael Beckwith - new age authorLee Bower - ""get rich quick"" authorJack Canfield - ""life"" coachJohn Demartini - ""get rich quick"" authorMarie Diamond - feng shui ""master"", life coachMike Dooley - new age authorBob Doyle - ""get rich quick"" authorHale Dwoskin - speaker, authorMorris and Cathy Goodman - motivational speakerJohn Gray - relationship authorJohn Hagelin - author, seller of ""high fidelity"" audio equipmentBill Harris - psuedo-scientistEsther Hicks - spirit channeler, motivational speaker, authorLoral Langemeier - ""get rich quick"" authorLisa Nichols - motivational speakerBob Proctor - motivational speaker, ""get rich quick"" authorJames Arthur Ray - ""get rich quick"" authorDavid Schirmer - ""get rich quick"" authorMarci Shimoff - motivational speaker, authorJoe Vitale - self-proclaimed marketing expertDenis Waitley - ""productivity consultant"", authorNeale Donald Walsch - new age author, speakerFred Alan Wolf - physicist, TV personality, has disavowed connection to The SecretIn an effort to establish credibility that simply isn't there, the redundant courtesy title faux pas throughout screams AMATEURS, accompanying every ""expert's"" name, e.g., Dr. So and So, Ph.D.  It appears to be a secret that properly it is either Dr. OR Ph.D., not both, and normally the credentials in American usage follow the name:  Myselfforexample, Ph.D.  Although some insecure Ph.D.'s and virtually all psychologists insist on being addressed as ""Dr.,"" the title is usually reserved for actual medical doctors. Otherwise, credentials become shades of gray with great potential for misrepresentation. In this film, most participants addressed as ""Dr."" are neither physicians nor Ph.D.s, and evidently earned the title in some other universe. Since the overwhelming majority have no genuine credentials whatsoever, a bunch of indecipherable and somewhat scary letters follow their names:  ""Visionary, I.M.A.,CH.,aR.,La.,TAN.""Also questionable are the quotes from the famously successful that suggest, sort of, validation of these ideas, but not so much when yanked out of context.Most distasteful of all, from beginning to end the ""secret"" is applied as a conduit to materialistic fame and fortune.  FEEL the steering wheel of that new sports car, and the universe will find a way for you to have it.  Hang a picture of that $5 million house on your ""visionary wall,"" and lo and behold you will find yourself living in that house. The most absurd example I can offer here is the assertion that those of us who get bills in the mail are ""attracting"" bills because we are thinking ""debt"", instead of ""wealth.""  Think ""wealth,"" and checks will come in the mail instead.

1030615,AV33FCIDH59N8,B000K3I7SO,Reviewer,"[1, 3]","Like the reviewer Denise above, I was interested to find out what all the excitement was over this movie.  Seeing the movie unfold, I expected some great profound mysterious secret to be unveiled.  I was quite disappointed to find that the entire movie revolved very simply over something that every church goer or anyone who has picked up a bible or even a positive self help book and that is, ""Believe that you have already received and it shall be given unto you..."".  After seeing the entire movie, I said to myself, ""That's IT?  This whole secret business is revolving around this one-sentence truth?""  I was a bit disappointed.Another premise of the movie is that the ""universe will align itself to us..."" which means that the entire universe will shift itself for us.  But this is false since it isn't the universe that changes, it is the way we think and the positive changes in our own mind and lives that bring about the already awaiting blessings of the universe.  It is US who must change, make the positive changes to align ourselves to the fundamental principles of the laws of the Universe, not the other way around.  So the movie conveys two messages which seem to conflict:  1) That the universe changes for us and 2) that when we think positive, we make the universe change for us.The way I see it, people must change their heart and minds to be one of abundance, love, and giving, in order to be the recipients of what blessings are waiting for them from the ""universe"".  Also, what is the definition of the ""Universe""?  Is it supposed to be God or the Creator?  God MADE the universe, not the other way around.  God is bigger and greater than the thing He made and He made the universe as a fertile magnificant resource for us.  When we change ourselves to be in alignment and living these very positive fundamental spiritual principles, we become the recipients of what is already stored up for us - as great gifts from a Creator who loves each of us.Seems like the movie has a message that positive thinking brings everything you want.  The movie seems to be want-and-attain based and certainly could have been more about how not only to receive but how to be a blessing and a resource of love and joy for others.  I do like how the movie did state several times that receiving is very important.  Many times in this society of selfishness and control, we think more about getting, attaining, and controlling, than we do about loving, resting, and receiving.  You can just tell by our social conditioning that many people receive with a selfish heart instead of a greatful abundant filled heart that has gratitude. Gratitude begins with being greatful for exactly what you have around you before you can be greatful for what you don't have - yet.  The movie did talk about this and that was a very good reminder.There was a kind of selfish undertone to it and it was more about getting and attracting and wanting and desiring.  Not that these things are bad but they were certainly out of proportion to the other side of the same coin principle:  That in order to be a recipient of great blessings, we also have to have open love and blessings for others so that the great power of the laws of abundance can flow through us to all.  This was hinted upon but mostly missed.  It is mentioned as one of the principles but could have been pressed a little more since this is an area that people often severely overlook.I was a bit disappointed at the end of the movie when the genie popped out because first of all, the Aladdin character was desperate, sneaking around corners of the building as if he had stolen the lamp and then desperately, he rubs the lamp with anxiety on his face.  The genie came out of the lamp and it seemed like suddenly the great potent force of the entire physical world was reduced down to a hunky looking blue guy saying ""your wish is my command"".  It may have reached some people in this symbology but it sort of weakened the concept of the ""universe"" to me.I see the universe as God's creation and in that creation He made all things available and set the laws of Love in motion so that it could be a self regulating, self operative and self sustaining power and when we align OURSELVES to that power by changing ourselves, (not aligning the universe to us), we reap the benefits of living a positive love filled live has to offer.And I use the word God which seems to be less popular these days as many people are anti-God and anti-Christ so they prefer benign distant terms like ""universe"" and ""universal power"" in order to keep the personal relationship aspect of a Deity at a distance.  Whatever!Good merits of the movie is that if no one has any foundational understanding or introduction to the power of positive thinking or for someone just beginning to have some kind of hope and faith in their dreams, this movie is a good beginning, a very beginner simplistic concept.  Anyone with any more substantial education in spiritual development and positive thinking probably can use the movie as a refresher course in ""Postive Thinking 101"".I'm not saying this movie is bad, it is very good, especially for people trying to get their breakthrough.  I bought a copy of it and refer to it now and then.  But it is only part and parcel to a bigger picture.  Also, I find the book more interesting than the movie and the book is a very good thing to have in one's collection.",3,Hyped up simplicity,1231200000,"01 6, 2009",2009,5425,"['reviewer', 'Denise',

I acknowledge that what is said is true, but what dissapoints me is the utter materialistic and superficial angle it promotes.After having studied Anthroposophy, Theosophy, Gnosis, comparative Mythology, Philosophy and Religion I feel that this secret is just the first step in Self-Knowledge, the very basics. It's too bad that the producers did not include more esoteric information.I don't think that this is ""THE secret"", kept from the public because it is common sense, anyone who is mature knows ""this secret"". There are far more greater secrets that we should be aware of, like the mysteries of Kaballah, and Alchemy for instance.For me, this movie didn't show me anything new, and I am not facincated by the hype, don't be either. There's so MUCH MORE than the Law of Attraction, Success and Well-Being, although they are extremely vital and important.I want to let whoever reads this that one can find more substance and deeper wisdom in such authors as: Madamme Blavatsky, Rudolf Steiner, Manly P. Hall, Edouard Schure, Gurdjieff, Ouspensky, and my favorite, Samael Aun Weor.-I also want to also let you know that there is another DVD that just came out by Thelema Press (their first) that truly and profoundly reaveals for the first time a real secret.
