It's an important film because it, like the documentary, point out real problems that cities all over this country have not only with youth crime but most importantly the failure we are as a society to rehabilitate.The previews, and indeed the film, focus a lot on the football aspects of this film almost to a fault. I say this because this story is about the achievements made with these kids off the field rather than on it. We shouldn't be caring so much about whether these kids win a football game as much as we should be caring whether they do something to cause them to end up back in prison. I say almost to a fault because while there are considerable football scenes, it is important to see these kids' achievements on the field in order to make sense of their acheivements off it, and while there may be a lot of action on the field, it never overshadows the fact that this is a tough-love teacher film a la 'Lean on Me' and 'Stand and Deliver', not a sports movie.Dwayne 'The Rock' Johnson as coach Sean Porter isn't going to be winning any academy awards for this film, but he does show considerable screen presence and enough talent as an actor to pull off a dramatic role like this. Xybit as Malcome Moore not only adds a certain credibility to this film, but I found his parts to be to few and far between which should speak to his talents. The rest of the cast and especially the kids I found to be highly believable. A few times the dialogue they would have to say was a bit too cheesy (or too profound), but one can hardly fault them for that.The strength of this film lies in the characters and the story. Sean Porter is a hero who had to fight against a society that doesn't care about these kids. These kids, while criminals deserving punishment (and rehabilitation), are kids who live in a world where any one of us would likely have grown up the same way. Sean Porter doesn't work miracles and turn all these kids into honor students and model citizens. What he does is sacrifice of himself to make a dent. There is a touching realism to that as well as a profound realization that we could make miracles instead of dents if the rest of us were more like Sean Porter.Gridiron Gang is a very enjoyable film. It has it's flaws, but at it's core it's a very human film capable of winning you over with it's moving and inspirational story. I found myself questioning some directorial decisions of the film, but I was never bored. It will almost certainly find it's way into my DVD collection eventually.",4,Don't mistake this film for another football movie,1159747200,"10 2, 2006",2006,2855,"['What', 'Gridiron', 'Gang', 'cinematic', 'acheivement', 'more', 'up', 'heart.For', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'Gridiron', 'Gang', 'based', 'documentary', 'same', 'name', 'was', 'true', 'account', 'youth', 'correctional', 'facility', 'using', 'sport', 'football', 'teach', 'kids', 'things', 'normal', 'process', 'was', 'failing', 'do', 'important', 'film', 'documentary', 'point', 'out', 'real', 'problems', 'cities', 'country', 'have', 'not', 'only', 'youth', 'crime', 'most', 'importantly', 'failure', 'are', 'society', 'rehabilitate.The', 'previews', 'indeed', 'film', 'focus', 'lot', 'football', 'aspects', 'film', 'almost', 'fault', 'say', 'story', 'achievements', 'made', 'kids', 'field', 'rather', 'should', ""n't"", 'be', 'caring', 'so', 'much', 'kids', 'win', 'football', 'game', 'as', 'much', 'should', 'be', 'caring', 'do', 'something', 'cause', 'end', 'up', 'back', 'prison', 'say', 'almost', 'fault', 'are', 'considerable', 'football', 'scenes', 'important', 'see', 'kids', 'achievements', 'field', 'order', 'make', 'sense', 'acheivements', 'may', 'be', 'lot', 'action', 'field', 'never', 'fact', 'tough-love', 'teacher', 'film', 'la', 'Me', ""'Stand"", 'Deliver', 'not', 'sports', 'movie.Dwayne', 'Rock', 'Johnson', 'coach', 'Sean', 'Porter', ""n't"", 'going', 'be', 'winning', 'academy', 'awards', 'film', 'show', 'considerable', 'screen', 'presence', 'enough', 'talent', 'actor', 'pull', 'off', 'dramatic', 'role', 'Xybit', 'Malcome', 'Moore', 'not', 'only', 'certain', 'credibility', 'film', 'found', 'parts', 'be', 'few', 'far', 'should', 'speak', 'talents', 'rest', 'cast', 'especially', 'kids', 'found', 'be', 'highly', 'believable', 'few', 'times', 'dialogue', 'would', 'have', 'say', 'was', 'bit', 'too', 'cheesy', 'too', 'profound', 'one', 'can', 'hardly', 'fault', 'that.The', 'strength', 'film', 'characters', 'story', 'Sean', 'Porter', 'hero', 'who', 'had', 'fight', 'society', ""n't"", 'care', 'kids', 'kids', 'criminals', 'deserving', 'punishment', 'rehabilitation', 'are', 'kids', 'who', 'live', 'world', 'where', 'one', 'would', 'likely', 'have', 'grown', 'up', 'same', 'way', 'Sean', 'Porter', ""n't"", 'work', 'miracles', 'turn', 'kids', 'honor', 'students', 'model', 'citizens', 'What', 'sacrifice', 'make', 'dent', 'touching', 'realism', 'as', 'well', 'profound', 'realization', 'could', 'make', 'miracles', 'instead', 'dents', 'rest', 'were', 'more', 'Sean', 'Porter.Gridiron', 'Gang', 'very', 'enjoyable', 'film', 'flaws', 'core', 'very', 'human', 'film', 'capable', 'winning', 'moving', 'inspirational', 'story', 'found', 'questioning', 'directorial', 'decisions', 'film', 'was', 'never', 'bored', 'will', 'almost', 'certainly', 'find', 'way', 'DVD', 'collection', 'eventually']",N/A
1034337,A2582KMXLK2P06,B000KHYN9C,B. E Jackson,"[0, 0]","In my opinion, this is NOT your typical ""angry teens come together to create a sports team and win a championship"" type movie.  As a wrestling fan, I've known the Rock for a long time.  When his popularity began to increase as Hollywood began to notice he had a talent for acting, I knew his time in a wrestling ring was coming closer to an end.  Can't blame the guy either- he accomplished a lot in the ring, and it was time for him to turn the page and try out something different.Now, with that said, I've been a bit disappointed in some of the Rock's movies as of late.  Doom was probably my favorite, even though the storyline was really silly.  Gridiron Gang is another movie where the Rock's talent shines.  In the film, he plays the role of a coach who has to help a bunch of gang teenagers form a football team and win a championship.  However, the movie isn't as predictable as many of these type of films usually are.  This one really focuses on the problems and the violence of gangs, and really was created in a way so you care about each of the teenagers on the football team.  They all played an important role, and you will remember them when the movie's over because so much time was devoted to them.Furthermore, there are bits of gang-related storyline segments throughout the film.  There are certain moments when the teenagers were really believable how they wanted *badly* to be a positive influence on other troubled gang members and the Rock himself, and how important it was to focus on the correct side of living your life.  Just because these angry gang members committed serious crimes at a young age does not mean there's no hope for them.  It doesn't mean you should give up on them because they made some serious mistakes.  In the film, they acknowledge their wrong way, and struggle to change their lives because it was a serious challenge for them to change their ways.As for the Rock, his role as the head coach was amazing.  I know, you've heard the word ""amazing"" a million times.  This time it's true!  He was very supportive of his team, and really wanted them to be proud of themselves for their accomplishments.  He congratulated them when they tried their hardest to succeed, and the Rock was hard on them when they weren't giving it their everything.  The Rock always believed in them and knew the teens could be much better people than they were giving themselves credit for.  A very good ending, too.  Not as happy as you'd expect these kind of movies to be.  I won't spoil the ending, but you'll be left thinking about how important it is to live a positive life before the credits start rolling.",5,truly excellent,1189123200,"09 7, 2007",2007,2640,"['opinion', 'NOT', 'typical', 'angry', 'come', 'together', 'create', 'sports', 'team', 'win', 'championship', 'type', 'movie', 'wrestling', 'fan', ""'ve"", 'known', 'Rock', 'long', 'time', 'When', 'popularity', 'began', 'increase', 'Hollywood', 'began', 'notice', 'had', 'talent', 'acting', 'knew', 'time', 'wrestling', 'ring', 'was', 'coming', 'closer', 'end', 'Ca', ""n't"", 'blame', 'guy', 'either-', 'accomplished', 'lot', 'ring', 'was', 'time', 'turn', 'page', 'try', 'out', 'something', 'different.Now', 'said', ""'ve"", 'been', 'bit', 'disappointed', 'Rock', 'movies', 'late', 'Doom', 'was', 'probably', 'favorite', 'even', 'storyline', 'was', 'really', 'silly', 'Gridiron', 'Gang', 'movie', 'where', 'Rock', 'talent', 'shines', 'film', 'role', 'coach', 'who', 'help', 'bunch', 'gang', 'teenagers', 'form', 'football', 'team', 'win', 'championship', 'However', 'movie', ""n't"", 'as', 'predictable', 'many', 'type', 'films', 'usually', 'are', 'one', 'really', 'problems', 'violence', 'gangs', 'really', 'was', 'created', 'way', 'care', 'teenagers', 'football', 'team', 'played', 'important', 'role', 'will', 'remember', 'when', 'movie', 'so', 'much', 'time', 'was', 'devoted', 'them.Furthermore', 'are', 'bits', 'gang-related', 'storyline', 'segments', 'film', 'are', 'certain', 'moments', 'when', 'teenagers', 'were', 'really', 'believable', 'how', 'wanted', '*badly*', 'be', 'positive', 'influence', 'other', 'troubled', 'gang', 'members', 'Rock', 'how', 'important', 'was', 'focus', 'correct', 'side', 'living', 'life', 'Just', 'angry', 'gang', 'members', 'committed', 'serious', 'crimes', 'young', 'age', 'not', 'mean', 'hope', ""n't"", 'mean', 'should', 'give', 'up', 'made', 'serious', 'mistakes', 'film', 'acknowledge', 'wrong', 'way', 'struggle', 'change', 'lives', 'was', 'serious', 'challenge', 'change', 'ways.As', 'Rock', 'role', 'head', 'coach', 'was', 'amazing', 'know', ""'ve"", 'heard', 'word', 'amazing', 'million', 'times', 'time', 'true', 'was', 'very', 'supportive', 'team', 'really', 'wanted', 'be', 'proud', 'accomplishments', 'congratulated', 'when', 'tried', 'hardest', 'succeed', 'Rock', 'was', 'hard', 'when', 'were', ""n't"", 'giving', 'everything', 'Rock', 'always', 'believed', 'knew', 'teens', 'could', 'be', 'much', 'better', 'people', 'were', 'giving', 'credit', 'very', 'good', 'ending', 'too', 'Not', 'as', 'happy', ""'d"", 'expect', 'kind', 'movies', 'be', 'wo', ""n't"", 'spoil', 'ending', ""'ll"", 'be', 'left', 'thinking', 'how', 'important', 'live', 'positive', 'life', 'credits', 'start', 'rolling']",N/A

We've been through soccer, baseball, tennis, dance, track and football: GRIDIRON GANG uses football as the pivotal point, but due to the presence of a fine script by Jeff Maguire who adapted Jac Flanders documentary film, and cohesive poignant direction by Phil Joanou who knows how to move a large cast around and keep it personal, and most of all due to the overpoweringly fine performance by Dwayne 'The Rock' Johnson this film is so honest and uplifting that it doesn't leave a dry eye in the audience.The story is well known: Probation Officer Sean Porter (Johnson) is frustrated that the boys in his camp for young criminals when released to the streets show 75% returning and a large number dying in gang related violence.  He sees this trend as being due to the lack of self-esteem in kids whose lives outside are demeaning and encourage failure.  He gathers support from his fellow workers Malcolm Moore (Xzibit), Paul Higa (Leon Rippy) and Ted Dexter (Kevin Dunn) and gradually builds confidence in his project to organize a football team of his inmates.  We wisely get to know the background of a few of the more difficult incarcerated boys, a fact that makes the project more full of tension and understanding of the problems to be resolved.  Though most of the cast are unknowns, they are fine actors in this film:  Jade Yorker, David V. Thomas, Setu Taase, Mo, James Earl, Trever O'Brien, Brandon Mychal Smith, Danny Martinez, Joe Seo, and Joey Lucero.Through the team's growth as a unit they confront and manage to cope with problems and grow into goal-driven, good spirited young men.  The presence of Dwayne 'The Rock' Johnson is stunningly underplayed and all the more powerful for it. This is a sensitive performance that places Johnson in an all new category of respect as an actor.  The film is overly long (120 minutes) due to repeated games the team plays and for devotees of Football that will be a positive aspect.

1034349,A2HVL790PBWYTU,B000KHYN9C,"H. Bala ""Me Too Can Read""","[5, 5]","Before it was a movie, Gridiron Gang was a 1993 Emmy-Award winning documentary filmed by Lee Stanley, about the Camp Kilpatrick football program's astounding inaugural 1990 season. Real life coaches Sean Porter and Malcolm Moore led a team comprised of juvenile criminals to their region's championship game. It was only a matter of time before the inspirational story became a movie.According to a troubling stat displayed at the outset of the film, there are 120,000 kids in our juvenile detention system, and 75% of them end up incarcerated. Sean Porter, having been a troubled juvenile himself, straightened out his life thanks, in some part, to football. Now, he toils as a beleaguered correctional officer in Camp Kilpatrick, L.A. County Probation Dept.  Times are bleak at Camp Kilpatrick, as  inner city gang rivalries, brittle temperaments, and incessant posturings often give rise to tensions and eventual brutal confrontations between the hardened young wards. As a last resort to get thru to the kids, the pro-active Sean Porter decides to initiate a football program for the correctional facility. This program, he hopes, would instill in the kids a sense of teamwork and unity and give them something to belong to, outside of their various gangs and 'hoods. Along the way, Coach Porter struggles to overcome sundry challenges, such as procuring team funding, finding high school teams to play his Mustangs, overcoming the vast skepticism facing his program, and, perhaps, most problematic of all, getting the kids to believe that they could be winners. Throughout all this, Porter must also cope with the fact that his mother is terminally ill. Porter and the Mustangs are given four weeks in which to get in some kind of playing shape before the first game is officially kicked off. The contentious team, at first, finds it rough going as most of them seem to be raw athletes, unaware of the concept of teamwork and the intricacies of the set plays. For Pete's sake, they have trouble spelling their team nickname. An early loss to a powerhouse team threatens to devastate the kids' already spotty self-esteem. Ongoing internal conflicts continue to plague the group. Still, ultimately, Gridiron Gang tells the uplifting story of the hardluck Kilpatrick Mustangs, as they learn to squash their differences, put aside their loser's mentality, become a team, and compete in the regional playoffs.So this is a true story and well worth watching because of it. Impassioned people who try to make a difference and who go above and beyond their expected duty should always be put under the spotlight and lauded universally. That's why I loved movies like Stand and Deliver, Lean On Me, and even the recent TNT movie The Ron Clark Story. Those cats actually accomplished all those great things. Which leads us back to Gridiron Gang and its real life hero Sean Porter. Gridiron Gang is a gritty, root-for-the-underdog sports drama, as well as yet another cautionary commentary on our country's ever-escalating inner-city struggles. Being able to film in the actual Camp Kilpatrick facility in the Santa Monica Mountains lends Gridiron Gang a sense of authenticity and immediacy. Hopelessness hovers and lingers in the shots filmed of the youth probation camp. Sadly juxtaposed with the coming together of the football team are scenes of other, non-football playing delinquents who continue to stay unreformed and be thrown in the isolation box. Not everyone can be helped; not everyone wants to be helped.The actual football sequences are decent, but nothing spectacular. Remember, these are supposed to be high-school level kids who aren't that proficient with football anyway. When they do improve and start to string out a number of wins, they still don't achieve the level of NFL players. So, the thrills we get from the action on the field are derived mostly from our emotional investment in the characters. Still, there are football moments which will make you applaud. In fact, this movie contains several hanky moments which will make the average person's eyes well up.This is the Rock's best performance to date. Now, I know, that's really not saying much, as he's mostly done action films so far (though he did stretch out in Be Cool). But he seems to have deep emotional connections with this film. Even if he couldn't quite pull off some of those hokey, motivational pep talks, I gotta give him full marks for genuine effort. He is ferocious and sincere in this role and even acquits himself fairly well in his teary-eyed scenes. He also draws on his past football experience as he seems to be right at home on the gridiron physically, as well as being credible with the football dialogue. Instead of resorting to wiggling his trademark eyebrow or deepening those two vertical furrows on his brow, Dwayne Johnson actually tries a hand at acting here.Hip hop artist Xzibit has a nicely subdued but effectual role as Malcolm Moore, Porter's fellow correctional officer and Mustangs coach. Malcolm Moore, by the way, played football in college and in the pros back in the day (USC & the L.A. Rams). The one to watch, though, is Jade Yorker. As Willie Weathers, a teenager grieving over his cousin's recent murder by a rival gang, and who later fatally shoots his mother's abusive man, he typifies the lost and angry kid ensnared in slum poverty, stuck in society's bottom rung, and given few chances to climb higher. But Willie is lucky enough to have the poetry-reciting Danyelle in his life, and, with her and as a Mustang, he sees possibilities that go beyond the scope of barbed fences and prison bars. Jade Yorker, more than any of the other young actors, brings his character to full realization. David V. Thomas as Kelvin Owens, member of a gang at war with Willie's 88th Street homies, and Setu Taase as violent Samoan Junior Palaita bring the same level of intensity and that feral hostility simmering just below the skin, which, more often than not, erupts to the surface. The other kids in the cast are almost equally as good and, certainly, are equally as honest in their portrayals. Brandon Smith, as Bug the cheerleading team waterboy (whose past crime is disturbing, in light of his excessive youth and cheerful nature) provides some moments of levity.I urge you to stick around for several fascinating clips from the original documentary, which are shown with the closing credits. These clips showcase the real Sean Porter, who looks to be just about as big as the Rock and they also show how close the Rock's lines stuck to Porter's original words. It's worth noting that upon hearing the by now prerequisite ""What Are They Doing Now"" segment at the end, reality manages to push aside the Cinderella elements of the story. None of these guys ended up playing pro football; most were lucky to end up playing the sport in high school. Sadly, as stated by the Rock's voiceover, not all the original Mustangs got out and were able to turn things around. But enough of them did stop gangbanging and resorting to crime so that Sean Porter's maverick program (as well as the concept of second chances) is fully justified. On the Amazon rating system, I think Gridiron Gang merits 3 and a half stars. So give this one a chance. Its heart is very much in the right place, and it's a good movie.",4,"""Do you accept the Mustang challenge?""",1158537600,"09 18, 2006",2006,7318,"['was', 'movie', 'Gridiron', 'Gang', 'was', '1993',

1034350,A192KEPM0HW6AC,B000KHYN9C,"Interplanetary Funksmanship ""Swift lippin', e...","[8, 8]","Who really wants to see another feel-good movie about a tough educator who takes on both the most violent juvenile delinquents and ""the system,"" raising them from the abyss of failure and imprisonment to success that they wouldn't have dared dream of only months before? Do we really need another formulaic sports flick, ""based on a true story"" about a coach taking his rag-tag team of underdogs all the way to the city championship?You bet we do!In what's being touted as Dwayne ""The Rock"" Johnson's dramatic debut, Gridiron Gang showcases both the former professional wrestler's physical prowess and his emerging acting chops as tough-as-nails juvenile detention officer Sean Porter. Frustrated by the 75 percent recidivism rate of the teen felons in his charge at the Camp Kilpatrick reformatory in Los Angeles County, Porter sees that the vicious circle of violence, gang activity, and growing up without fathers has doomed them to wasted lives behind bars.He keeps sending one troubled kid in particular, Roger (Michael J. Pagan), to ""the hole"" for punishment.""Where're you gonna be in four years?"" Porter grills him.""In jail,"" the sulking youth answers.""No! You're going to be dead!""Sure enough, even though Roger is trying to go straight, while on release a week later he is gunned down in a drive-by shooting while hanging out with his old gang. Soon Roger's brother Willie (Jade Yorker) winds up at the same reformatory when he shoots his mother's abusive live-in boyfriend.Driving home from work one night, Porter spots a group of kids playing football under the lights and has an inspiration. As a last-ditch effort to try to turn around the presumably unsalvageable lives of Camp Kilpatrick's murderers, rapists, and carjackers, he launches a football program.Porter cajoles many of the toughest youths to join the Mustang team, where nobody gets a free ride and membership has to be earned. Attempting to convince the skeptical administration to fund his team, he reminds them that ""these kids have never worked hard for anything in their lives."" Once his kids amble onto the practice field, they learn that being tough is more than bullying and posturing, but requires discipline, commitment, and self-restraint.What impressed me most were the sequences in which Porter builds up the team, drilling them through tough workouts and scrimmages, testing their endurance, and, for the first time in their lives, forging their characters. As with Spencer Tracy's Father Flanagan in the 1938 classic Boys Town, Porter operates on the premise that his boys are not inherently bad. ""You are somebody,"" he tells them, ""and are worthy of something."" But his attempts to inspire the team go beyond mere pep talks: Porter instills in them the lesson that true self-esteem can be gained only by achievement, not merely by inflating their egos with false praise. ""It's a whole new world out there when you earn things,"" he tells them.Having Coach Porter as the first man in their lives to believe in them and serve as a father figure fills the youths with false expectations at their first game. Despite a couple of good tackles early on, the Mustangs get a rude awakening once their opponents gather steam. After getting stomped on for a 38-0 loss, not only do many on the team start to question whether the football program is worth it, but so do some of Camp Kilpatrick's administrators.""We wanted to create self-esteem, but it was just the opposite,"" one of them laments to Porter. ""These kids can't handle that kind of disappointment. We have to pull the plug.""Just as everyone seems willing to throw in the towel, one of Porter's players, Junior (Setu Taase), discovers that self-esteem is more than immediate gratification, and requires diligent effort even in the face of crushing defeat. Junior convinces his teammates why they must not give up. ""It's like I told you, Coach,"" he explains to Porter, ""we're tired of being losers."" Predictably, the Mustangs improve and fight their way to the playoffs.While the action on the field is shot a little too claustrophobically with telephoto lenses, the movie as a whole doesn't suffer much. Trevor Rabin (of the group Yes) provides an emotionally rousing soundtrack. But the pillar of the film is The Rock, who supports it with a strong performance. A former University of Miami football standout, he brings credibility and conviction to his role. While he's come a long way from his ""Layeth the Smacketh Down"" WWF days, The Rock is still not exactly an accomplished and subtle actor. Of course, tough kids don't need understatement and nuance--they need sturdy and straightforward. Think Lee Marvin's Major Reisman from The Dirty Dozen, crossed with Glenn Ford's Mr. Dadier in Blackboard Jungle.In the durable genre of tough educators who turn around troubled inner-city youths, The Rock's turn on screen in Gridiron Gang doesn't rise to the level of Morgan Freeman's breakthrough performance in Lean on Me (1989), or Sidney Poitier's memorable turn in To Sir, with Love (1967). Neither does Gridiron Gang belong in the same league with other great sports flicks about underdog teams who go all the way to the top, like Hoosiers (1986) or Friday Night Lights (2004).But, as a movie which straddles both genres, it really gels and will lift the spirits of most viewers. Sure, Gridiron Gang is formulaic. But what makes it enjoyable and moving is the true-life example of how one man turns around the lives of troubled kids by instilling them with pride, faith in themselves, and awareness that they are not born criminals, but possess the free will to make productive lives for themselves.No-excuses self-esteem requires a formula, too; and Gridiron Gang shows how it's done.",3,"""The Rock"" of

1034352,A2YM3KILJ1G0YJ,B000KHYN9C,Jason,"[0, 0]","First and foremost, Dwayne ""The Rock"" Johnson is incredibly believable in Gridioron Gang.  The role is not a big stretch for Johnson considering his history as a child with a distant father (Johnson's father was often away wrestling professionally), and as a former football player.  It should come as no surprise that he completely nails the part, playing the role of Sean Porter perfectly; so much so, in fact, that the actual documentary footage of the real Porter was a near mirror image of Johnson's portrayal of Porter in the movie.Sean Porter (Johnson) is a former football player turned counselor at a juvenile detention center.  The job is daunting enough, especially considering that nearly 75% of those leaving the facility end up as repeat offenders at one time or another after their release.  Porter sought to encourage the young men, show them that they have inner-strength, worth, and that they were actually winners in the game of life, not the losers that ended up in the facility.The movie is full of cliches, and it's about as predictable as a sunrise.  It's the typical underdogs-achieve-excellence-through-adversity-and-teamwork story.  It's formulaic, and just like countless other sports movies.  The difference, however, is that this movie has incredible heart.  Johnson exudes powerful yet gentle emotion as the fatherly, caring, football coach who uses tough-love and the bonding of football to bring about both football and character results.There are a handful of genuinely touching scenes, and I'll admit that it got a bit dusty while watching.  My allergies were really acting up during the scene that the players buy flowers for Porter's ailing mother.Gridiron Gang is well worth the watch.

Somehow though it still managed to strike some nerve in me. Some parts of it I've felt like I'd seen but others shocked me because of how uncliched and down to earth realistic they were.I think you know the general plot of the movie. Teenagers in a juvenile school/camp get the opportunity to play football because they think it will give them a chance at success after they're released. The man in charge of the team is played by the Rock, and he does a fine job as the coach. I really can't think of anybody, based on this script that could have done a better job in the role. He brings realism and fun to the character, and just the slightest bit of depth lacking from his previous roles. Xzibit barley spoke through the movie, he was just a tag on for sales but did great for what he was given.  The other actors did a great job of portraying what -I assume- life would be like in a situation like that of the young boys. They did make you realize how hard life can be for a lot of them. This movie will make you laugh and at the same time want to adopt the kids. It's sad to think of things like this actually happening in life.The film is beautiful to look at despite the shaky-cam. The score however I felt dragged the film down. It's the clich&eacute; sports-film music. I think a lot more or at least something different could have been done but a good amount of football was shown in the movie, which I enjoyed.Overall this is a pretty good film. Oscars? Not at all. Box office hit? It wasn't even close. Probably will go down with ""Invincible."" Popular with the general public?

1034354,A2XQMGE2YY88DC,B000KHYN9C,Jiang Xueqin,"[0, 0]","I was actually looking forward to this movie.  I've always liked football movies, and I sympathize with juvenile delinquents trying to make good.  And while this story was itself inspiring I found this movie to be comically bad.First, the casting of The Rock was inappropriate for the leading role.  The man was no acting ability whatsoever, and everyone has to pretend he has no acting ability whatsoever in order to make him look decent.  He's only capable of two emotions (neutral and a smile), and he's so desperate at maintaining his winning smile and attitude that he also needs to appear infallible.  Thus, the emotional arc of the movie is limited.Then there's the story itself.  This movie is actually based on a documentary of a group of juvenile delinquent football players, and it tries to adhere to the actual speeches from the documentary (and the speeches are lame and mundane) while adding in a typical Hollywood football movie plot, which makes the football movie entirely predictable.Also, for anyone who's played sports, there are some football moves that just aren't believable.  If quarterbacks want to put more power and distance in their throw, they lean forward with their hip muscles -- they do not jump up and throw the ball because by jumping up they lose power and distance.",2,Comically Stupid,1343692800,"07 31, 2012",2012,1302,"['was', 'actually', 'looking', 'forward', 'movie', ""'ve"", 'always', 'liked', 'football', 'movies', 'sympathize', 'juvenile', 'delinquents', 'trying', 'make', 'good', 'story', 'was', 'inspiring', 'found', 'movie', 'be', 'comically', 'bad.First', 'casting', 'Rock', 'was', 'inappropriate', 'leading', 'role', 'man', 'was', 'acting', 'ability', 'whatsoever', 'everyone', 'pretend', 'acting', 'ability', 'whatsoever', 'order', 'make', 'look', 'decent', 'only', 'capable', 'two', 'emotions', 'neutral', 'smile', 'so', 'desperate', 'maintaining', 'winning', 'smile', 'attitude', 'also', 'appear', 'infallible', 'Thus', 'emotional', 'arc', 'movie', 'limited.Then', 'story', 'movie', 'actually', 'based', 'documentary', 'group', 'juvenile', 'delinquent', 'football', 'players', 'adhere', 'actual', 'speeches', 'documentary', 'speeches', 'are', 'lame', 'mundane', 'adding', 'typical', 'Hollywood', 'football', 'movie', 'plot', 'football', 'movie', 'entirely', 'predictable.Also', 'anyone', 'who', 'played', 'sports', 'are', 'football', 'just', 'are', ""n't"", 'believable', 'quarterbacks', 'want', 'put', 'more', 'power', 'distance', 'throw', 'lean', 'forward', 'hip', 'muscles', 'do', 'not', 'jump', 'up', 'throw', 'ball', 'jumping', 'up', 'lose', 'power', 'distance']",N/A
1034355,AIFXFHO2N9WJB,B000KHYN9C,"Justice0309 ""Justice""","[3, 3]","The subject matter of troubled inner-city kids and how to reach them, is a popular subject for movies, and generally tends to focus on gripping drama, violence, plenty of language, and of course decent box office return.  The problem with these types of films is that they also tend to all feel pretty much the same.  The typical formula for these films is as follows:  present the kids and their problems (many times these stories are based on real-life events or resemble them in some way), introduce the person that will be responsible for changing these troubled lives, showcase the unique and innovative way that these kids will be reached, and have all or some of the kids make a miraculous turn down the path of goodness and virtue.  Generally speaking, what I just listed is the basic outline for movies such as ""Dangerous Minds"", ""The Principal"", and ""Coach Carter"", there are many others like them, but the list would just be too long.  Now, I'm not saying that these movies are bad; on the contrary, most of these types of films turn out to be very uplifting movies or just great to watch because they are so gripping and powerful.  Another movie that easily fits into this category is the true story of a group of teenagers in a juvenile detention center that focus their aggressions on the game of football in the uplifting sports drama ""Gridiron Gang"" starring Dwayne `The Rock' Johnson.""Gridiron Gang"" is the true story of a group of teenage delinquents that receive a chance to redeem themselves and learn self-respect, teamwork, and discipline through the game of football.  Probation officer Sean Porter (Dwayne `The Rock' Johnson) feels that the only way to reach the kids at his detention center is to give them an outlet to let out their aggression while at the same time teaching them life lessons, and he determines that football is the perfect way to accomplish this task.  Assisting in his audacious endeavor is his co-worker turned assistant coach Malcolm (Xzibit), who believes that Sean may be out of his mind, but they are running out of options so why not try something new.  So with a full season of football ahead of them this group of untrained, selfish kids must learn how to peacefully coexist with each other and work together as a team, while proving to everyone that though the choices they had made thus far in their lives had made them losers, they still have the ability within them to become what no one expected - winners.This rousing, uplifting movie may feature a story similar to one we've seen time and time again.  However, the uncommon outlet by which Porter chooses to reach these kids, and the individual dramas that each character goes through, and the fact that it is a true story, makes this movie feel different and causes it to stand out from the rest of its kind.  The performances were all terrific, from the unknown actors playing the various kids in the detention camp that join the football team, to Xzibit, a former rapper turned actor who has handed in another great performance (his previous film was the excellent thriller ""Derailed"").  In my opinion though, the absolute best performance has to be Dwayne `The Rock' Johnson's, who has already proven in many other movies that he has what it takes to be the next reigning action hero in Hollywood, but confidently shows us here that he also has what it takes to handle gripping drama, and delivers audiences what is easily the greatest performance this far in his career.The directing by Phil Joanou was well done and interesting because he often chose to use a handheld camera which gave many scenes a very anxious and shaky feel, a choice that I felt reflected many of the character's inner-struggles.  The decision to focus the story not only on one or two character's struggles in life, but on the entire team was a nice change for the genre, because it assisted in the story feeling more balanced and less `Hollywood-ized'.  Yes, the story did focus a little more on one or two characters over the other ones, but I felt each one had an equally fleshed out story that I understood, and was interested in.  Another good decision, and one that surprised me to some extent, was that the football aspect of the story was very prominent.  Generally in these types of films the solution that will prove to save these troubled kids only comes to complete fruition in the latter half of the movie, but here it's established early on, and is proven to be a working method that focuses the kids.So, does ""Gridiron Gang"" feel a little bit like a `been there, done that' type of movie, yeah a little bit, but the story for the movie is so strong and appears to stick pretty closely to the actual events, that you can't help but enjoy and be uplifted by it.  If you liked the movies I listed earlier, and all the others that I didn't list that are of this type of film, then I highly recommend that you watch ""Gridiron Gang"", it will not disappoint you.""Gridiron Gang"" is rated PG-13 for violence and language.",5,Everyone Deserves A Second Chance...,1177286400,"04 23, 2007",2007,5017,"['subject', 'matter', 'troubled', 'inner-city', 'kids',

To ensure that this happens, anyone who wants to join the team must make a three-pronged commitment: the dorm (they have to live together), school (they have to be better students), and the Gridiron (they have to try their hardest on the football field).This movie will appeal to the same sort of people who enjoyed movies like Coach Carter and We Are Marshall.  Having enjoyed both, I can say that this is an inspirational sports drama that shows that people can reform from their old ways. The film deals with gang violence, racial prejudice, and teen crime in a way that doesn't glorify them and instead offers ways to overcome them. My only complaint about this film is that The Rock has on body paint that gets progressively darker throughout the film. By the end he looked like he'd been covered in shoe polish.

Frankly, I made this movie very last on my list of things to watch after I had seen everything else I wanted to see. I was wrong! This movie was so much more than I expected it to be. I know there are quite a few people saying that this movie wasn't anything special, but truthfully, there really aren't many things you'll find special about a lot of movies these days. That's mostly due to the lack of originality floating around though. Secondly, The Rock's acting ability has come light years since his first film. Frankly, I expected him to be a one hit wonder with the ""Scorpion King"", and eventually fizzle out just like the rest of his fellow wrestler/actor compadres who have failed miserably at it long before him. Third, I found this movie to be very inspirational by having grown up in the hood and witnessing a lot  of my family and friends living this lifestyle and ending up in places exactly like this due to the choices they made. Fourth, I finally got to see a movie that actually shows life behind bars as being much more than prison rapes, riots, shankings, and drug cartels. It's usually those type of prison movies were everyone dies and you end up being so depressed at the end of it because nothing good happened throughout the entire movie. I've certainly seen my fair share of those films I'll tell you. That's why I'm glad this movie showed that just because these individuals had become locked up for whatever reason that still didn't mean they were all hopeless human beings who had become threats to society and themselves. It shows that these men can actually come out of this situation rehabilitated and with something to strive for. A lot of these men have been written off by society and nobody really cares what happens to them. Therefore, since they don't have support systems or people who believe in them they are most likely to become habitual felons and go back into incarceration. This movie shows how these young men were given hope, and that lets them know that coming back to prison doesn't have to be their future. That they can actually be good at something, and learn how to turn their aggressions into something positive. I don't know about other viewers, but I really liked this movie seeing as how I've seen first hand what places like that can do to a person's spirit if they allow themselves to be destroyed.

It attempts to portray these youth (and intends it to be a generalization of all inner-city minorities and the like) -- murderers, gang members, etc. -- as merely misled, lonely, and lacking in confidence, and shows that if someone (the coach) just reaches out to them, and gives them something to be proud of (football), they will magically all be saved. They'll learn to read, give up gangs, be disciplined, be morally guided, discover work ethic, etc. etc. etc. In movies this is great -- it makes all the white people feel good for WHATEVER reason; I assume some kind of misplaced guilt -- but in real life this is simply an outlier. This might be the case for 1/100 youth. I've played football with them, went to school with them, been friends with them, hung out with them, everything. They don't change for the most part.

So in that sense, this film does not provide a lot of original concepts. What it does provide though, is an uplifting story and a good balance between the scenes focused on the personal stories of the main characters and the sport moments.Dwayne ""The Rock"" Johnson plays Sean Porter, a counselor at a juvenile detention center, who is sick and tired of seeing these kids get back on the street only to get killed or sent to jail. In a burst of inspiration, he decides that creating a football team may be the answer to the problem. However, this is easier said than done, and there are many challenges along the way. Overcoming the gang wars among the teenagers under his care is just part of the problem; finding a league in which to play and convincing the kids that they are not losers, proves to be a big challenge.The movie definitely succeeds in conveying the immensity of the problem created by gangs. It does this through a set of eye-opening personal stories that help understand why these kids behave like they do and why they ended up in gangs in the first place. As is expected, there is a fair amount of violence included in the plot, but I think that this was used wisely and without exaggeration. Regarding the performances, I was really impressed by how much The Rock has evolved as an actor, which shows that he is taking the change in careers very seriously. I remember liking his role in ""Be Cool"", but that was one in which the character provided more leeway for inexperience; in this case, the job he faced was much tougher.If you are looking for a sports movie that provides something new and original, you will likely be disappointed by this effort. But, as was my case, if you want to spend some time entertained by a moving, though predictable, story about beating the odds with hard work and the support of a team, then you should give this film a try.Be Cool (Widescreen Edition)",4,"""Then let's try the impossible, because the possible just ain't working""",1190851200,"09 27, 2007",2007,2019,"['concept', 'creating', 'movie', 'based', 'problem', 'kids', 'mentor', 'guiding', 'good', 'path', 'not', 'novel', 'So', 'sense', 'film', 'not', 'provide', 'lot', 'original', 'concepts', 'What', 'provide', 'uplifting', 'story', 'good', 'balance', 'scenes', 'focused', 'personal', 'stories', 'main', 'characters', 'sport', 'moments.Dwayne', 'Rock', 'Johnson', 'Sean', 'Porter', 'counselor', 'juvenile', 'detention', 'center', 'who', 'sick', 'tired', 'seeing', 'kids', 'get', 'back', 'street', 'only', 'get', 'killed', 'sent', 'jail', 'burst', 'inspiration', 'creating', 'football', 'team', 'may', 'be', 'answer', 'problem', 'However', 'easier', 'said', 'done', 'are', 'many', 'challenges', 'way', 'Overcoming', 'gang', 'wars', 'teenagers', 'care', 'just', 'part', 'problem', 'finding', 'league', 'play', 'convincing', 'kids', 'are', 'not', 'losers', 'be', 'big', 'challenge.The', 'movie', 'definitely', 'conveying', 'immensity', 'problem', 'created', 'gangs', 'set', 'eye-opening', 'personal', 'stories', 'help', 'understand', 'why', 'kids', 'behave', 'do', 'why', 'ended', 'up', 'gangs', 'first', 'place', 'expected', 'fair', 'amount', 'violence', 'included', 'plot', 'think', 'was', 'used', 'wisely', 'exaggeration', 'Regarding', 'performances', 'was', 'really', 'impressed', 'how', 'much', 'Rock', 'evolved', 'actor', 'taking', 'change', 'careers', 'very', 'seriously', 'remember', 'liking', 'role', 'Be', 'Cool', 'was', 'one', 'character', 'provided', 'more', 'leeway', 'inexperience', 'case', 'job', 'faced', 'was', 'much', 'are', 'looking', 'sports', 'movie', 'something', 'new', 'original', 'will', 'likely', 'be', 'disappointed', 'effort', 'was', 'case', 'want', 'spend', 'time', 'entertained', 'moving', 'predictable', 'story', 'beating', 'odds', 'hard', 'work', 'support', 'team', 'then', 'should', 'give', 'film', 'try.Be', 'Cool', 'Widescreen', 'Edition']",N/A
