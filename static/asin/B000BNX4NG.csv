945900,A37PV5GMP2ILJC,B000BNX4NG,Amanda Richards,"[26, 33]","This is the third DVD of the series, and contains another four adventures of the five colorful friends known as the Backyardigans.Polka Palace Party introduces kids to four new genres of music.  The songs in the four adventures are themed to Polka, Irish folk music, Gilbert & Sullivan and Rockabilly.Unfortunately, the grouping in this DVD puts the two slower musical themes back to back, and between ""High Tea"" with its Irish theme and ""The Heart of the Jungle"" based on the music of Gilbert & Sullivan, my son lost interest and barely glanced at ""Viking Voyage"".Because of this, I am forced to watch Polka Palace Party repeatedly, as nobody wants to go any further.Not the best one to get for a first purchase, but still worth a look.Amanda Richards, February 5, 2006",4,Not the best one to get for your first Backyardigan purchase,1139011200,"02 4, 2006",2006,770,"['third', 'DVD', 'series', 'four', 'adventures', 'five', 'colorful', 'friends', 'known', 'Backyardigans.Polka', 'Palace', 'Party', 'introduces', 'kids', 'four', 'new', 'genres', 'music', 'songs', 'four', 'adventures', 'are', 'themed', 'Polka', 'Irish', 'folk', 'music', 'Gilbert', 'Sullivan', 'Rockabilly.Unfortunately', 'grouping', 'DVD', 'two', 'slower', 'musical', 'themes', 'back', 'back', 'High', 'Tea', 'Irish', 'theme', 'Heart', 'Jungle', 'based', 'music', 'Gilbert', 'Sullivan', 'son', 'lost', 'interest', 'barely', 'glanced', 'Viking', 'Voyage', '.Because', 'am', 'forced', 'watch', 'Polka', 'Palace', 'Party', 'repeatedly', 'nobody', 'go', 'further.Not', 'best', 'one', 'get', 'first', 'purchase', 'still', 'look.Amanda', 'Richards', 'February', '5', '2006']",N/A

The music is catchy (I often find myself humming along with the DVD), the colors are bright and engaging, and the story lines are easy to follow.
