The writing was fantastic and the characters delightfull, but what was truly great about this show was the way it just drew the viewers into these people's lives, the way it dealt with pregnancy scares, criminal backgrounds, menopause, meeting the in-laws, spicing up one's sex life, career changes, personal politics, alcoholism, fear of commitment, identity crisis, jealousy, fear of change, and marriage--all in the first season, and all with a sense of levity that is lacking in much of today's popular television! Watching these 3 DVD's, I laughed until I cried.Also touching are the commentaries done by the actors that play Dharma, Abbey, and Larry. They truly loved their time working on the series, had a great fondness for their fellow actors, felt at home in the sets (they point out details about the O'Neil/Finkelstein kitchen, and the Finkelstein/Montgomery living room that you probably never noticed, and tell amusing stories about props), and are always willing to laugh at themselves (""Abby's"" tales of her ever-changing hair and her real-life husband, who was the inspiration for Larry, and how he beat up Goofy at Disney World, are well worth listening to the commentaries...also not to be missed are ""Dharma's"" descriptions of eyebrow do's and don'ts, and ""Larry's"" tips on where to buy hippy clothes).My favorite moments in this season of the series include: watching Penn (of Penn & Teller) play a man who thinks he is a housecat, seeing two young women trying to cook their first Thanksgiving dinner manage to lose a live lobster, watching Greg attempt yoga, watching Laurie Metcalf (of Roseanne) play a psychotic self-defense instructor who invades Dharma's nightmares, and seeing a woman with gothic make-up, dreds, and black fishnets walk down the aisle in a pink bridesmaid's dress, followed by a rather tall drag-queen on the arm of a short groomsman.",4,"Timeless Comedy, Touching Commentary",1157328000,"09 4, 2006",2006,2051,"['Others', 'have', 'listed', 'episodes', 'descriptions', ""'ll"", 'just', 'add', 'food', 'thought.Watching', 'whole', 'first', 'series', 'sequential', 'order', 'real', 'eye-opener', 'writing', 'was', 'fantastic', 'characters', 'delightfull', 'what', 'was', 'truly', 'great', 'show', 'was', 'way', 'just', 'drew', 'viewers', 'people', 'lives', 'way', 'pregnancy', 'scares', 'criminal', 'backgrounds', 'menopause', 'meeting', 'in-laws', 'spicing', 'up', 'one', 'sex', 'life', 'career', 'changes', 'personal', 'politics', 'alcoholism', 'fear', 'commitment', 'identity', 'crisis', 'jealousy', 'fear', 'change', 'marriage', 'first', 'season', 'sense', 'levity', 'lacking', 'much', 'today', 'popular', 'television', 'Watching', '3', 'DVD', 'laughed', 'cried.Also', 'touching', 'are', 'commentaries', 'done', 'actors', 'play', 'Dharma', 'Abbey', 'Larry', 'truly', 'loved', 'time', 'working', 'series', 'had', 'great', 'fondness', 'fellow', 'actors', 'felt', 'home', 'sets', 'point', 'out', 'details', ""O'Neil/Finkelstein"", 'kitchen', 'Finkelstein/Montgomery', 'living', 'room', 'probably', 'never', 'noticed', 'tell', 'amusing', 'stories', 'props', 'are', 'always', 'willing', 'laugh', 'Abby', 'tales', 'ever-changing', 'hair', 'real-life', 'husband', 'who', 'was', 'inspiration', 'Larry', 'how', 'beat', 'up', 'Goofy', 'Disney', 'World', 'are', 'well', 'worth', 'listening', 'commentaries', 'also', 'not', 'be', 'missed', 'are', 'Dharma', 'descriptions', 'eyebrow', 'do', ""don'ts"", 'Larry', 'tips', 'where', 'buy', 'hippy', 'clothes', '.My', 'favorite', 'moments', 'season', 'series', 'include', 'watching', 'Penn', 'Penn', 'Teller', 'play', 'man', 'who', 'housecat', 'seeing', 'two', 'young', 'women', 'trying', 'cook', 'first', 'Thanksgiving', 'dinner', 'manage', 'lose', 'live', 'lobster', 'watching', 'Greg', 'attempt', 'yoga', 'watching', 'Laurie', 'Metcalf', 'Roseanne', 'play', 'psychotic', 'self-defense', 'instructor', 'who', 'Dharma', 'nightmares', 'seeing', 'woman', 'gothic', 'make-up', 'dreds', 'black', 'fishnets', 'walk', 'aisle', 'pink', 'bridesmaid', 'dress', 'followed', 'rather', 'tall', 'drag-queen', 'arm', 'short', 'groomsman']",Dharma & Greg - Season One

Thomas Gibson (a k a ""Greg"") plays the romantic lead in the made-for-TV movie of Louisa May Alcott's ""The Inheritance,"" which was made in the late '90s when D&G;  was still going strong. He was great in the role and that reminded me how much I'd loved this series--how hilarious and well written and well acted and warm and fuzzy it was--and I wanted to see it again. All of it. So I came here, bought the Season One DVD, watched the whole thing in two sittings, and now I want more. Is that ever gonna be possible?While the Amazon index has links that purport to send customers to a page that accesses D&G;'s full run, all a click gets you (at least at this writing)  is this page where all that's offered is season one (terrific!) and a region 2 DVD of season two.  If anyone here knows why that's all that's available (because the rest of the series was never put on DVD? Or because it was but sold out and there's no hope a new batch will be forthcoming? Or that it's worth checking back here every now and then to see if there's more to come? Or what?)

Although it is available in syndication almost everywhere, it is worth purchasing, if for no other reason than to support good writing, talented acting, and sheer television pleasure.I have never understood why this show didn't last longer. In an age of really stupid ""I don't deserve my wife"" sitcoms, this program reminds us that it is possible to have a smart and engaging show about new marriage. Although the initial premise (a couple meet and marry on the same day despite wildly different lifestyles and beliefs) was a bit farcical, a superb ensemble cast held it together with finesse. This show handled serious, realistic situations with uncharacteristic grace and humor. Many times, it could have gone down the road with cheap gags and one-liners (and sometimes, to be honest, it does) but the situations are usually quite well-thought out.Totally worth the cost and then some.
