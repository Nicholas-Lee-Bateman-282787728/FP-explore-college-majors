They both were tremendously popular during this era, and, although this was the only movie they made together, they definitely had some chemistry between them on screen.  Based in Great Britain, Betty is a WAF and Tyrone is an RAF fighter pilot. She does some singing and dancing, he does some flying and philandering... All in all, a very enjoyable little movie!!",4,Very entertaining WW2 movie,1376870400,"08 19, 2013",2013,482,"['saw', 'movie', 'early', 'childhood', 'still', 'enjoy', 'Tyrone', 'Power', 'Betty', 'Grable', 'were', 'favorites', 'mine', 'were', 'tremendously', 'popular', 'era', 'was', 'only', 'movie', 'made', 'together', 'definitely', 'had', 'chemistry', 'screen', 'Based', 'Great', 'Britain', 'Betty', 'WAF', 'Tyrone', 'RAF', 'fighter', 'pilot', 'singing', 'dancing', 'flying', 'philandering', 'very', 'enjoyable', 'little', 'movie']",A Yank in the RAF

Van Devender ""Gadfly""","[0, 0]","Good flick for a lazy afternoon with nothing else to do.Black and white, predictable plot and 1941 level for  special effects.Good points:  Supporting cast - good job by the Brits.  Remember that this is before the US enters the war and so you have to put up with a bit of ambivalence in the plot line.  There was a surprisingly strong attempt to realistically portray the German aircraft in this movie.Not so good points:  Betty Grable and her supporting dancers.  If this was a low budget film then all the money went to the stars because those poor back up dancers must have been paid peanuts.  No really good aircraft scenes other than the beautiful Spitfire flying in formation.  War time censors must have restricted the aircraft that could be used.  Plot line is pretty thin.Bottom line:  It's worth watching and if you are an aviation nerd then seeing ""real time"" 1940 airplanes is worth the effort.  The rest... well... just chuckle and let it go.",3,War Without Blood...,1372032000,"06 24, 2013",2013,956,"['Good', 'flick', 'lazy', 'afternoon', 'nothing', 'else', 'do.Black', 'white', 'predictable', 'plot', '1941', 'level', 'special', 'effects.Good', 'points', 'Supporting', 'cast', 'good', 'job', 'Brits', 'Remember', 'US', 'war', 'so', 'have', 'put', 'up', 'bit', 'ambivalence', 'plot', 'line', 'was', 'surprisingly', 'strong', 'attempt', 'realistically', 'portray', 'German', 'aircraft', 'movie.Not', 'so', 'good', 'points', 'Betty', 'Grable', 'supporting', 'dancers', 'was', 'low', 'budget', 'film', 'then', 'money', 'went', 'stars', 'poor', 'back', 'dancers', 'must', 'have', 'been', 'paid', 'peanuts', 'No', 'really', 'good', 'aircraft', 'scenes', 'other', 'beautiful', 'Spitfire', 'flying', 'formation', 'War', 'time', 'censors', 'must', 'have', 'restricted', 'aircraft', 'could', 'be', 'used', 'Plot', 'line', 'pretty', 'thin.Bottom', 'line', 'worth', 'watching', 'are', 'aviation', 'nerd', 'then', 'seeing', 'real', 'time', '1940', 'airplanes', 'effort', 'rest', 'well', 'just', 'chuckle', 'let', 'go']",A Yank in the RAF
695991,A2MFNDNS1L7D16,B000063URW,JOHN GODFREY,"[0, 0]","The action takes place before the U.S. entry into the war. Tyrone Power, Tim is a crack American pilot flying bombers to England for profit. While in London he discovers his old flame from the states Carol (Betty Grable). She a dancer & volunteers for the war effort. Tim commences to take up with her & is rebuffed. To impress her he joins the RAF (Royal Air Force). This time he has competition from his commanding officer & fellow pilot. John is a  veddy proper, rich English gentleman & loves Carol intensely at first sight. She likes him but loves Tim. Tim in turn loves her but he is ""a worm"". So you have the classic loves triangle. The war intervenes from time to time. with some really good authentic & created dogfight scenes. They both return from saving 350,000 men at Dunkirk. Both have  proposed marriage to Carol before they left. The movie has a feel good ending from the original when one of the men conveniently died. That doesn't happen. Not good for morale. Speaking of which...the biggest star is of course, Betty's fantastic legs, shown early & often. This must have been the movie that launched her as America's Sweetheart. The pin-up that reminded all men of what they were fighting for.",4,Hollywood romantic comedy during World War II.,1325894400,"01 7, 2012",2012,1211,"['action', 'place', 'U.S.', 'entry', 'war', 'Tyrone', 'Power', 'Tim', 'crack', 'American', 'pilot', 'flying', 'bombers', 'England', 'profit', 'London', 'old', 'flame', 'states', 'Carol', 'Betty', 'Grable', 'dancer', 'volunteers', 'war', 'effort', 'Tim', 'take', 'up', 'rebuffed', 'impress', 'RAF', 'Royal', 'Air', 'Force', 'time', 'competition', 'commanding', 'officer', 'fellow', 'pilot', 'John', 'veddy', 'proper', 'rich', 'English', 'gentleman', 'loves', 'Carol', 'intensely', 'first', 'sight', 'Tim', 'Tim', 'turn', 'worm', 'have', 'classic', 'triangle', 'war', 'intervenes', 'time', 'time', 'really', 'good', 'authentic', 'created', 'dogfight', 'scenes', 'return', 'saving', '350,000', 'men', 'Dunkirk', 'have', 'proposed', 'marriage', 'Carol', 'left', 'movie', 'feel', 'good', 'ending', 'original', 'when', 'one', 'men', 'conveniently', 'died', ""n't"", 'happen', 'Not', 'good', 'morale', 'Speaking', 'biggest', 'star', 'course', 'Betty', 'fantastic', 'legs', 'shown', 'early', 'often', 'must', 'have', 'been', 'movie', 'launched', 'America', 'Sweetheart', 'pin-up', 'reminded', 'men', 'what', 'were', 'fighting']",A Yank in the RAF
