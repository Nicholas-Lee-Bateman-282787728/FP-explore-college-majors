1692571,A3BMUBUC1N77U8,B00HW3EJ6Y,ahoffoss,"[10, 15]","Let me first start out by saying I can not express exactly how BAD this movie really is!  This movie has taken one hour and 24 minutes of my life that I will never get back.  I know, I tried,...but it's gone.  That being said, I'm going to try my best to keep others from suffering the same fate as me!  Again, this movie is HORRIBLE!  I've seen a few movies in my day that were horrible, but I was able to sit through and enjoy parts of them.  Not this one.  I'm really bummed out because I've been hearing about this movie for some time now on the horror blogs/sites and was looking forward to it.  It's not just the generic storyline, but the acting is beyond terrible!  I have no idea how Paz de la Huerta managed to talk her way into this role, but they deserve the firing that they will inevitably receive.*******WARNING!!!!  I'm going to completely RUIN this movie (just like it ruined one hour and 24 minutes of my life)*******The movie begins with nurse, Abby Russell (Paz de la Huerta) hanging out at a local club trying to lure married men into a trap.  She attempts to flirt with them and leaves them one last chance to change their minds before further pursuing them.  She baits the first guy and within seconds, he's hooked.  He quickly follows her to the roof for what he thinks is going to be a night to remember.  However, she's got different plans in mind and takes a scalpel to his artery.  She then gives him two options:  FIRST, he can attempt to get away and bleed out, or SECOND, he can take the ""easy"" way out and end his own life by leaping from the roof.  Of course, she then goes for a third option and as he inches towards the side she tosses him over herself.Now, at this point (the first 5-10 minutes) I was thinking, ""Sweet!  It's kind of like Dexter!""  You know, doing evil, but for good!  I have to admit,...even with the bad acting, they sucked me in!  Well done, movie,....well done!  Then things took a turn for the worse,....The next day, we meet Danni (Katrina Bowden), a new nurse that has caught Abby's eye.  Addy and Danni quickly became friends during Danni's residency and now it is Danni's first day on the job.  Danni freezes during a procedure with a patient and completely messes things up, which angers Dr. Morris (Judd Nelson).  Danni is sure she will be fired so Abby takes the opportunity to comfort her and ask her out for drinks to make her feel better.  Danni agrees and they head to a local bar.The next morning Danni awakens with no memory of the previous night's events, but chalks it up to drinking and heads into work.  She passes Dr. Morris in the hall and is awaiting a scolding, but instead is treated with a friendly, ""Look, we got off on the wrong foot.""  This pleases Danni, until Dr. Morris forces himself against her in what would be a sure-fire sexual assault lawsuit.  Of course, this is a (terrible) movie, and those things don't happen here so she goes about her business.Abby overhears Danni and her boyfriend, Steve (Corbin Bleu), arguing over the phone.  Abby again, sees this as an opportunity and tells Danni she should leave him.  Danni says that she might just need to stay with her mom for a while, but that she hates her step dad, Larry (Martin Donovan).  She says, that's the reason she needs to stay with her because Larry treats her mother so poorly.  This peeks Abby's interest, so she sets out to find Larry.  When she does, she makes quick work of him by injecting a medicine into his neck causing paralysis (all the while setting Danni up,...you know,...just in case).  She then runs his car into traffic and, yep, he's gone.At the funeral, Danni sees Abby talking to Detective John Rogan (Boris Kodjoe).  When she questions Abby about their discussion, Abby reveals that she's been a patient to Larry (he's a Psychiatrist).  Suspicions arise and Abby begins to look into Danni's past. Danni becomes more and more distant with Abby, so Abby starts sending Danni emails containing pictures that were taken when she was drunk during their night out.It's at this point, the hospital gets a new PR manager, Rachael (Melanie Scrofano).  When Rachael meets Abby, she insists that she looks like someone she used to know (obviously).  Abby quickly asks her out for drinks in which Rachael accepts.  As Danni is asleep that night, she receives a Skype request from Rachael.  Abby can be seen in the background and as Danni tried to warn Rachael (she's too drunk to notice), the screen goes black.  Danni calls 911 and the police head out.The next day, Danni is at the police station being questioned when she sees Abby talking to the Detective.  After Abby leaves, the detective confronts Danni, saying that Abby is accusing her of being obsessed and stalking.  When Danni attempts to respond, Detective Rogan brings out the pics that Abby took for the night out drinking.  This causes Steve to get angry and leave Danni.Danni finally takes time to look into the little girl Rachael spoke about,...and wouldn't you know it?!  She's the same girl!  (of COURSE she's the same girl.  It's ALWAYS the same girl,..we've seen this story a million times!)  Danni rushes back to the hospital.  Abby is already there, when she is approached by Dr. Morris.  He says that Danni has told him some things and that he either needs to look into it, or maybe they can talk about it.  Abby takes poor Dr. Morris down to the morgue (where else?!) where he thinks he's about to have a good time and instead gets his arm chopped off (only after she carves the word ""Pig"" into his chest).  Poor Dr. Morris.During the last part of the movie, it pretty much turns into a bloodbath.  During all the ruckus, Steve is killed (by scissors to the neck) and Abby somehow manages to get away.  She then finds herself face to face with Detective Rogan.  He attempts to arrest her, but before he can, HE is killed by a bat to the head (courtesy of her neighbor).The movie ending matches the rest of the movie,...TERRIBLE!  Of course, she's gotten away with it and who would even THINK to look for her afterwards, right?!  But this time she's gotten a new job and taken Rachael's identity (sort of), leaving a path for a potential sequel.  Oh wow,.....a sequel.  I can't even imagine?!  I'll leave that for someone else to review.There might be some parts I'm not EXACT on, but that's the gist of the movie.  I can't remember every little detail, because to tell you the truth, I was just wishing for it to be over.  However, once I start something, I usually don't stop (especially with a horror movie) in hopes that it will eventually get better.  So again, under no circumstances should you waste even one second of your life on this movie!  I can not stress this enough! I just can't understand how the people involved can't see this and actually let it out for the world to see?!",1,Like wasting time AND money?!

1692573,A6J7UPYUI96XO,B00HW3EJ6Y,"Cory T. Shaeffer ""HockeyFanatic""","[2, 3]","First of all, this movie is not for everyone. There is a lot of blood, nudity, and language. It is not a straight up horror film; more of a black comedy with all the elements of horror. There is revenge, anger, brutality, seduction...and a female lead performance (Paz De La Huerta) that rivals some of the most conniving female villains we've come to know so well.The plot, as it is, basically revolves around a nurse who is less than stable...and out to do away with cheating men (and anyone else who stands in her way). De La Huerta is absolutely brilliant in the role, and the supporting cast does well (or at least as well as the likes of Judd Nelson and Katrina Bowden are capable of doing).Every week it seems there are a few bland, less than creative horror films released to video. The genre is in desperate need of some creativity, and this movie (along with &#34;Excision&#34;) provide some of that. One may argue that exploitation is not creativity, but at least this film is intriguing. There is something about a great female lead in horror films, and this film has got something going for it. Recommended for fans of revenge films and comedy horror along the lines of &#34;Excision&#34; and &#34;Girls vs. Boys.&#34; To this film's credit, it steers away from becoming a run of the mill torture flick, courtesy of De La Huerta and her off beat delivery of sharp one liners and unpredictable behavior throughout.",4,Horror With a Comedic Twist,1399334400,"05 6, 2014",2014,1426,"['First', 'all', 'movie', 'not', 'everyone', 'lot', 'blood', 'nudity', 'language', 'not', 'straight', 'up', 'horror', 'film', 'more', 'black', 'comedy', 'elements', 'horror', 'revenge', 'anger', 'brutality', 'seduction', 'female', 'lead', 'performance', 'Paz', 'De', 'La', 'Huerta', 'most', 'conniving', 'female', 'villains', ""'ve"", 'come', 'know', 'so', 'well.The', 'plot', 'basically', 'around', 'nurse', 'who', 'less', 'stable', 'do', 'away', 'cheating', 'men', 'anyone', 'else', 'who', 'way', 'De', 'La', 'Huerta', 'absolutely', 'brilliant', 'role', 'supporting', 'cast', 'well', 'least', 'as', 'well', 'likes', 'Judd', 'Nelson', 'Katrina', 'Bowden', 'are', 'capable', 'doing', '.Every', 'week', 'are', 'few', 'bland', 'less', 'creative', 'horror', 'films', 'released', 'video', 'genre', 'desperate', 'need', 'creativity', 'movie', '34', 'Excision', '34', 'provide', 'One', 'may', 'argue', 'exploitation', 'not', 'creativity', 'least', 'film', 'intriguing', 'something', 'great', 'female', 'lead', 'horror', 'films', 'film', 'got', 'something', 'going', 'Recommended', 'fans', 'revenge', 'films', 'comedy', 'horror', 'lines', '34', 'Excision', '34', '34', 'Girls', 'Boys.', '34', 'film', 'credit', 'away', 'becoming', 'run', 'mill', 'torture', 'flick', 'courtesy', 'De', 'La', 'Huerta', 'off', 'beat', 'delivery', 'sharp', 'one', 'liners', 'unpredictable', 'behavior']",N/A

The blood.  The gore.  The nudity.  The makers of the film paint everything in broad strokes but for the most part it oddly falls hollow.  There are two reasons to recommend the film most notably the performance of Paz de la Huerta whose take on psychotic nurse Abby Russell is sly and knowing.  De la Huerta sees the irony in the premise that escapes the makers of  the film.  Classic scene of her ordering takeout after dispatching another ""cheater"" is priceless.  The twist ending is also pretty clever but a case of too little too late.

1692580,ABQUJ3Z6EP5GN,B00HW3EJ6Y,John's Horror Corner,"[1, 2]","I walked into this expecting something like a more seductive version of American Mary (2012).  What I got was more like a stylishly shot and scored ""Fatal Attraction to a Single White Female American Psycho"" cult film.  Complete with cheesy lines, abduction, spewing gore, an epically destructive hospital catfight, death-by-defibrillator and plenty of nudity, this will surely please lovers of shock, schlock and exploitation cinema.  This also has the production quality and star power to please those who like a stylishly different horror/slasher film from time to time.  Writer/director Douglas Aarniokoski (The Day) has done us well with his leading lady...Meet the sultry Abigail Russell (Paz de la Huerta; Boardwalk Empire), medical professional by day and sauntering sexual sociopath by night.  Her hobbies include wearing sexy lingerie, dabbling in lesbianism, blackmailing and seducing her co-workers, and killing adulterous married men looking to two-time their wives.Abigail works with the cute, insecure newbie Danni (Katrina Bowden) and immediately becomes obsessed with her, wanting Danni to leave her boyfriend so they can to be together.  When Danni doesn't share this whim and tries to distance herself, Abigail aims her deep-seeded instability at the people in Danni's life.At times, Abigail is perfectly sociopathic and sexy--especially during the opening sequence which includes her narration.  But her execution sometimes walks the line between sociopathic emotional emptiness and stale acting--which I believe to be the fuel to the fire of most negative reviews.  In general, I find her flat mood appealing and it especially suits her as she obsesses over Danni.  It smacks pretty hard of Single White Female (1992) with just a culinary dash of American Psycho (2000), but she's more about sexual fixation than trying to ""become"" the object of her desire.  Abigail targets men who she perceives to have wronged Danni, along with anyone else who stands in Abigail's way.The finale brings us a brilliant admixture of an epically brutal catfight interspersed with a punctuated killing spree that ravages a hospital staff with a staggering body count.This movie is just plain cult film fun done well.",3,"This film is a somewhat cheesy, stylishly produced, gory, exploitative cult film fun.",1392595200,"02 17, 2014",2014,2219,"['walked', 'expecting', 'something', 'more', 'seductive', 'version', 'American', 'Mary', '2012', 'What', 'got', 'was', 'more', 'stylishly', 'shot', 'scored', 'Fatal', 'Attraction', 'Single', 'White', 'Female', 'American', 'Psycho', 'cult', 'film', 'Complete', 'cheesy', 'lines', 'abduction', 'spewing', 'gore', 'epically', 'destructive', 'hospital', 'catfight', 'death-by-defibrillator', 'plenty', 'nudity', 'will', 'surely', 'please', 'lovers', 'shock', 'schlock', 'exploitation', 'cinema', 'also', 'production', 'quality', 'star', 'power', 'please', 'who', 'like', 'stylishly', 'different', 'horror/slasher', 'film', 'time', 'time', 'Writer/director', 'Douglas', 'Aarniokoski', 'Day', 'done', 'well', 'leading', 'lady', 'Meet', 'sultry', 'Abigail', 'Russell', 'Paz', 'de', 'la', 'Huerta', 'Boardwalk', 'Empire', 'medical', 'professional', 'day', 'sauntering', 'sexual', 'sociopath', 'night', 'hobbies', 'include', 'wearing', 'sexy', 'lingerie', 'dabbling', 'lesbianism', 'blackmailing', 'seducing', 'co-workers', 'killing', 'adulterous', 'married', 'men', 'looking', 'two-time', 'wives.Abigail', 'cute', 'insecure', 'newbie', 'Danni', 'Katrina', 'Bowden', 'immediately', 'becomes', 'obsessed', 'wanting', 'Danni', 'leave', 'boyfriend', 'can', 'be', 'together', 'When', 'Danni', ""n't"", 'share', 'whim', 'tries', 'distance', 'Abigail', 'deep-seeded', 'instability', 'people', 'Danni', 'life.At', 'times', 'Abigail', 'perfectly', 'sociopathic', 'sexy', 'especially', 'opening', 'sequence', 'narration', 'execution', 'sometimes', 'line', 'sociopathic', 'emotional', 'emptiness', 'stale', 'acting', 'believe', 'be', 'fuel', 'fire', 'most', 'negative', 'reviews', 'general', 'find', 'flat', 'mood', 'appealing', 'especially', 'suits', 'Danni', 'pretty', 'hard', 'Single', 'White', 'Female', '1992', 'just', 'culinary', 'dash', 'American', 'Psycho', '2000', 'more', 'sexual', 'fixation', 'trying', 'become', 'object', 'desire', 'Abigail', 'targets', 'men', 'who', 'have', 'wronged', 'Danni', 'anyone', 'else', 'who', 'Abigail', 'way.The', 'finale', 'brings', 'brilliant', 'admixture', 'epically', 'brutal', 'catfight', 'interspersed', 'punctuated', 'killing', 'spree', 'hospital', 'staff', 'staggering', 'body', 'count.This', 'movie', 'just', 'plain', 'cult', 'film', 'fun', 'done', 'well']",N/A

She finds cheating married men, lures them with her feminine wiles, and then kills them because she considers them scum. At her day job, Danni, a new nurse that she has been mentoring, graduates, but freezes on her first day on the job. Abby has become obsessed with Danni and is angered when she goes to her boyfriend for help and comfort. Abby&#8217;s solution is to take her out drinking, drug her, have random men rape her, and then rape her herself. Danni is horrified and just wants to move on with her life and forget about the horrible night. However, Abby was expecting a completely different reaction and sets out to make her life a living hell.I had middling expectations watching Nurse 3D. I am wary of any film with 3D in the title because that means gimmicky 3D scenes that don&#8217;t actually add to the story in any way, but I wasn&#8217;t prepared for the true awfulness that is Nurse 3D. The story is a weird hodgepodge of a bunch of different films, namely Single White Female and Fatal Attraction. It really wants to be American Psycho, but is so off base, lacking the satire, good acting, good directing, etc. I like the storyline where Abby kills cheating men because it&#8217;s interesting and hasn&#8217;t been done about a thousand times before like the obsession story line. Unfortunately, after the opening scene, it barely gets any mention. The kills that follow sometimes follow that formula, but are mostly focused on killing those that are hurting Danni. The only other mention is the super cheesy flashback that shows her killing her cheating father when she was a child. The Single White Female story line was frankly boring and offensive. Rape is not a great way to start a relationship with someone and those scenes were unfortunately shown as titillating and never acknowledged as rape.Paz de la Huerta is a gorgeous woman and certainly looks the part of Abby as sexy and sultry. Unfortunately, her acting is horribly wooden. I think she was going for emotionless detachment, but it came across as simply inept. She is just trying too hard to be sexy, when she accomplishes it with little to no effort. Her voice came off as a bored phone sex operator. I really wanted to like her character, but she lacked the charisma and wit to pull it off. Her dialog is way too obvious and ham handed, with such gems as this: &#8220;There was actually moisture trickling down my leg. Larry made me cum after all.&#8221; Simply cringeworthy.Nurse 3D is an awful movie. I was expecting a campy, fun, bloody film like Machete, but I got a horrible story, wooden acting, and a script that defies logic and requires a huge suspension of disbelief. To counteract its failings, loads of gratuitous female nudity are employed. If that&#8217;s all the viewers are looking for, there is plenty of porn with better acting.
