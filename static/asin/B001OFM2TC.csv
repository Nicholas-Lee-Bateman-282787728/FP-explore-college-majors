On a trip to Seattle with her teenage daughter, she stumbles upon a supercell that begins to cause rare and forceful tornadoes in the area. When her daughter is caught in a dangerous twister, April must find a way to save her as well as an unprepared city from destruction.You know, I've seen dozens and dozens of tornado movies since ""Twister"" came out back in 1996. While I have my personal favorites amongst them all, Storm Cell is one that sits right alongside the best of them. True, watching it- it looks like your garden variety tornado movie but what Storm Cell excels as a movie is in how the dynamic between mother and daughter actually is in the movie. It was quite believable to me. To me, that made the movie a step above other movies of this type.Course, Storm Cell isn't without its' faults. People running around through flying debris without being hit is one thing. The ending is another thing, it didn't quite cut it for me.If you don't look too closely to the science of tornadoes and twisters while watching this movie, Storm Cell is a great watch.

Unfortunately, it didn't take long before I realized that wasn't going to happen.  First, Michael Ironside is barely in this movie (his part could have been played by anyone as his brief scenes were ""blink and you missed them."").  Second, Mimi Rogers' character is quite unlikable (as a mother or a storm chaser).  Her idiotic ""global warming"" rants straddle the line between glib and pathetically nave.  Alarmists might be amusing in comic supporting roles but not when they dominate the entire movie (complete with furrowed brow and way too many hysterical claims that are only borne out because they're written that way!).  The side issues that came up only served to make matters worse, not better.(During the 50s, movies turned their worry about atomic bombs into killer mutant bugs and monsters.  Welcome to this generation's straw man: global warming, the catchall excuse for all weather related disaster movies.
