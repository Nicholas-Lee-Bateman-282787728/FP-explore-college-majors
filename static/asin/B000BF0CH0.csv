The least impressive episode to me might well be this Christmas special.  And why is that?Well, I liked the TV series, and I thought that the video quality was fine for the series, but when they made this Xmas special, they actually choose to make this in some older looking reduce video quality to maker it look older.  Well, that certainly s*cked.  Watching this again after purchasing it over two years ago, I hate watching it because of it's poor video quality.  I hate it.  And the story just isn't interesting enough to even keep it to watch it during Christmas every year.  If anything, in the Special Features section, there is a 22 minute mini-documentary called ""Trailer Park Boys 101.""  This may help introduce other family and friends to the TV series itself.I watched it with a friend, and I felt embarrassed for it's video quality.  The story wasn't interesting enough to introduce my unaware friends of the appeal of the Trailer Park Boys TV series.  They blew it.  Oh well, maybe Trailer Park Boys: The Movie, may capture their interest, but, this Xmas Special certainly didn't.It's video quality really s*cks.  Wanna buy it off me?  Make an offer.

I am not going to get into too much detail because I don't want to ruin it for other people, but I will say the trademark TPB humor is here and also the special gives a little history of the characters.
