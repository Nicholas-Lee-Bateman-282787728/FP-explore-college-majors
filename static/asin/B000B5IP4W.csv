Many years later a creative team decided to resurrect the feel of the show and this is the result.  As pointed out in one of the many extras, this is not The Twilight Zone.  That show relied heavily on fantasy while this one would be grounded in science.Aliens are a favorite in this season as is man's need to tinker with the universe.  We even get a robot.  Some of the stories are based on classic science fiction like Sandkings (George R.R. Martin) and I, Robot (Eando Binder).  Others are fresh and new.  I was a big fan of the original series and have fully enjoyed this new one.  At its heart, this is the same series.There are several superficial differences between the old series and the new.  The new series is in color.  The new series includes harsher language.  The new series even include nudity up to full-frontal.  The new series can take advantage of slicker special effects.  But all of these things are minor.  Both series use quality actors and writers.  It is the intelligent stories that make the series and not the window dressing.  A great series that should be seen by all science fiction fans.This season includes the following episodes:SandkingsValerie 23Blood BrothersThe Second SoulWhite Light FeverThe ChoiceVirtual FutureLiving HellCorner of the EyeUnder the BedDark MattersThe ConversionQuality of MercyCaught in the ActThe Voyage HomeThe New BreedThe MessageI, RobotIf These Walls Could TalkBirthrightThe Voice of Reason (the only first-season flashback show)",4,Limits Are Tested,1162771200,"11 6, 2006",2006,1594,"['Following', 'footsteps', 'Tales', 'Tomorrow', 'original', 'Outer', 'Limits', 'was', 'landmark', 'show', 'Many', 'years', 'later', 'creative', 'team', 'decided', 'resurrect', 'feel', 'show', 'result', 'pointed', 'out', 'one', 'many', 'extras', 'not', 'Twilight', 'Zone', 'show', 'relied', 'heavily', 'fantasy', 'one', 'would', 'be', 'grounded', 'science.Aliens', 'are', 'favorite', 'season', 'man', 'need', 'tinker', 'universe', 'even', 'get', 'robot', 'stories', 'are', 'based', 'classic', 'science', 'fiction', 'Sandkings', 'George', 'R.R', 'Martin', 'Robot', 'Eando', 'Binder', 'Others', 'are', 'fresh', 'new', 'was', 'big', 'fan', 'original', 'series', 'have', 'fully', 'enjoyed', 'new', 'one', 'heart', 'same', 'are', 'several', 'superficial', 'differences', 'old', 'series', 'new', 'new', 'series', 'color', 'new', 'series', 'harsher', 'language', 'new', 'series', 'even', 'include', 'nudity', 'up', 'full-frontal', 'new', 'series', 'can', 'take', 'advantage', 'slicker', 'special', 'effects', 'things', 'are', 'minor', 'series', 'use', 'quality', 'actors', 'writers', 'intelligent', 'stories', 'make', 'series', 'not', 'window', 'dressing', 'great', 'series', 'should', 'be', 'seen', 'science', 'fiction', 'fans.This', 'season', 'following', 'episodes', 'SandkingsValerie', '23Blood', 'BrothersThe', 'Second', 'SoulWhite', 'Light', 'FeverThe', 'ChoiceVirtual', 'FutureLiving', 'HellCorner', 'EyeUnder', 'BedDark', 'MattersThe', 'ConversionQuality', 'MercyCaught', 'ActThe', 'Voyage', 'HomeThe', 'New', 'BreedThe', 'MessageI', 'RobotIf', 'Walls', 'Could', 'TalkBirthrightThe', 'Voice', 'Reason', 'only', 'first-season', 'flashback', 'show']",The Outer Limits

I was quite happy with it.The season is complete, more than complete actually. It has good bonus features.HOWEVER! PARENTAL WARNING:NOT MENTIONED READILY IN THE ITEM DESCRIPTION OR ON THE BOX (OR OTHER AMAZON REVIEWS) IS THE FACT THAT THIS WAS ORIGINALLY RELEASED ON SHOWTIME, AND THIS IS THE ""FULL VERSION"" INCLUDING THE OCCASIONAL (IN SOME CASES FULL-FRONTAL) NUDITY AND LOVE/SEX SCENES AS ORIGINALLY AIRED ON SHOWTIME.So, if you only saw this one WB, Fox, UPN or other ""broadcast"" network, be aware that the cable version was slightly more risque. There are several episodes with ""Showtime Moments"" of semi-gratuitous nudity. Fine for adults, but you may wish to keep a couple of the episodes away from the kids, or else definitely ""parentally supervise"" viewing. Definitely pre-view all episodes before allowing minors access, if unsure.Just figured I'd throw that out there. I'm an adult, and not opposed to nudity or sexual situations. It just took me by surprise, since I'd only seen the ""broadcast"" version, and the unapologetic nudity was a slighty shock (there really wasn't much if any warning on the package aside from an ""unrated"" stamp in the fine print on the lower corner of the back of the box). Though it was generally tastefully done... There were at least a few scenes that were a bit on the borderline ""graphic"" side.That said, it was truly a great series, both for sci-fi enthusiasts and for pushing some social and technical/film-making boundaries, and I look forward to the rest of the ""season"" compilations being released (as opposed to the thematic compilations).Truly a must have for anyone who love the series or good sci-fi. With the above parental warning in mind... ;o]",5,A worthy successor to the original series!,1165708800,"12 10, 2006",2006,1895,"['Okay', 'picture', 'beautiful', 'sound', 'great', ""'ve"", 'said', 'other', 'reviews', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'surround', 'sound', 'plasma', 'TV', '/', 'large', 'screen', ""'m"", 'sure', 'picture', 'quality', 'will', 'be', 'fine', 'there', 'too', 'was', 'quite', 'happy', 'it.The', 'season', 'complete', 'more', 'complete', 'actually', 'good', 'bonus', 'features.HOWEVER', 'PARENTAL', 'WARNING', 'NOT', 'MENTIONED', 'READILY', 'IN', 'THE', 'ITEM', 'DESCRIPTION', 'OR', 'ON', 'THE', 'BOX', 'OR', 'OTHER', 'AMAZON', 'REVIEWS', 'THE', 'FACT', 'THIS', 'WAS', 'ORIGINALLY', 'RELEASED', 'ON', 'SHOWTIME', 'AND', 'THIS', 'FULL', 'VERSION', 'THE', 'OCCASIONAL', 'IN', 'SOME', 'CASES', 'FULL-FRONTAL', 'NUDITY', 'AND', 'LOVE/SEX', 'SCENES', 'AS', 'ORIGINALLY', 'AIRED', 'ON', 'SHOWTIME.So', 'only', 'saw', 'one', 'WB', 'Fox', 'UPN', 'other', 'broadcast', 'network', 'be', 'aware', 'cable', 'version', 'was', 'slightly', 'more', 'risque', 'are', 'several', 'episodes', 'Showtime', 'Moments', 'semi-gratuitous', 'nudity', 'Fine', 'adults', 'may', 'wish', 'keep', 'couple', 'episodes', 'away', 'kids', 'else', 'definitely', 'parentally', 'supervise', 'viewing', 'Definitely', 'pre-view', 'episodes', 'allowing', 'minors', 'access', 'unsure.Just', 'figured', ""'d"", 'throw', 'there', ""'m"", 'adult', 'not', 'opposed', 'nudity', 'sexual', 'situations', 'just', 'took', 'surprise', ""'d"", 'only', 'seen', 'broadcast', 'version', 'unapologetic', 'nudity', 'was', 'slighty', 'shock', 'really', 'was', ""n't"", 'much', 'warning', 'package', 'aside', 'unrated', 'stamp', 'fine', 'print', 'lower', 'corner', 'back', 'box', 'was', 'generally', 'tastefully', 'done', 'were', 'least', 'few', 'scenes', 'were', 'bit', 'borderline', 'graphic', 'side.That', 'said', 'was', 'truly', 'great', 'series', 'sci-fi', 'enthusiasts', 'pushing', 'social', 'technical/film-making', 'boundaries', 'look', 'forward', 'rest', 'season', 'compilations', 'being', 'released', 'opposed', 'thematic', 'compilations', '.Truly', 'must', 'have', 'anyone', 'who', 'love', 'series', 'good', 'sci-fi', 'above', 'parental', 'warning', 'mind', ']']",The Outer Limits
935931,A29HVOSR9VLFKP,B000B5IP4W,Mike  Silverman,"[5, 6]","The Outer Limits is one of the very best anthology television series dedicated to science fiction. One of the fun things about this 1995 upgrade of the older 1960's Outer Limits series is that Joseph Stephano, the creator of the original series was tapped as executive consultant on this new series. So it maintains the flavor of the older series, while adding new stories, sharper and more sophisticated special effects and stage sets.Another great thing about this series is that a variety of different writers and directors worked on the episodes, giving each episode a unique feel to it.  The episodes of The Outer Limits are a stand-alone anthology.  Each of the episodes is a complete story unique from each other episode, and features some of the very best actors and actresses in the business. The episodes run approximately 1 hour each. The quality of the video is excellent, crystal clear images and color, and perfect audio.If Amazon does not have this on sale directly, I recommend getting this from one of Amazon's listed alternate sellers.  I recommend a seller that has the ""fulfillment by Amazon"", label.There's one other thing I'd like to note about the content of this series..., this was not a made-for-television series, it was made for the cable subscription channel Showtime, so it does not hold back on the graphic images of blood and sex.Below is a list of all the episodes in season one. You will see my comments on most of these in the list.  All of The Outer Limits episodes are excellent and contain the highest quality production values. I recommend the entire series, though it seems only the first season has been released in full. Episodes from other seasons are available in smaller packages.* The Sand Kings; Mysterious alien insectoid eggs are discovered in soil samples from another planet.  They are carefully being hatched in a government lab to study them. One of the insects escapes triggering a panic that shuts down the project. But the lead scientist lets his ego get the better of him and he steals a soil sample and tries to raise the insects to full adults at home.  A very strange and eerie episode with excellent effects , and  brilliant back-story about family dissolution as the scientist becomes obsessed to the point of neglecting his wife and putting his son in danger.* Valerie 23;  This is a darker version of ""I Robot"" from the original series.  A young disabled engineer who is working on an artificial skin project, is tapped as a test subject to take home a prototype robot/android named Valerie. Outstanding special effects highlight this one. Things get very much out of control in a frightening way as Valerie tries to adjust to new ""feelings"", especially with regard to her test owner.  There is some fascinating concepts thrown into this one as it explores the parameters of interaction between human and ""artificial"" life forms.* Blood Brothers;  This starts out with an ""evil corporation versus manipulated scientist"" theme, but surprisingly turns around later when the lines between right and wrong become blurred over what is to be done with a miraculous new drug concocted in a lab.  The drug appears to contain an immune system booster that makes the one who has taken an injection of it immune to all disease and even to the effects of aging.  But it becomes a nightmare when it is later discovered that this drug is not at all the miracle it first appeared to be.* Second Soul;  There is a twist ending to this one, but it's not what you might expect. This episode leads you in a direction filled with paranoia and panic about a strange alien race of intelligent human-like parasites who come to earth seeking dead bodies to inhabit so that these aliens don't die out, their own planet having become uninhabitable. Interesting dialogue between the aliens and the human director of the project designed to help them..., regarding life... , afterlife and the soul.* White Light Fever; A very bitter, very wealthy dying old man who is funding a medical project to build an implant to artificially keep a heart beating forever.., faces death many times as heart failure strikes him over and over. The special effects are minimal in this one, but the concepts are great.  An old man fears his death to the point of being willing to sacrifice younger people waiting for heart replacement so that he can keep living.  Doctors argue with each other over whether the old man deserves to get a new heart or not.* The Choice;  this one is the only episode I was not happy with. Do you remember the movie Carrie?  Well, this is sort of a mini version of that movie but with very strong feminist overtones. A young girl finds she has great mental power that she can project into a physical manifestation by pushing people around or hurting them ( men or boys ), and doesn't know how to control it, until she meets an adult woman who seems to have the same power and she helps the young girl control hers. They are being chased by an evil man who just seems to hate them for having this power, for no other reason, and ..., apparently men can not have this power because it is genetically available only within female chromosomes.  Carrie was better.* Virtual Future;  A virtual reality body suit and helmet, when ramped up to full throttle, cause visions of the future to appear for the person..., and about the person..., wearing it.  Interesting concepts are debated in this one.  If you know the future..., can you change it?  Perhaps, but what are the consequences?  This one is an ""evil corporation versus manipulated scientist"" theme.* Corner Of The Eye; A priest despairs of all the poverty and suffering he sees in ""trash town"" an area of the city where derelicts and destitute people huddle against the elements. He is in ""Trash Town"" handing out blankets and food to the people there, when the police raid the area , driving off the inhabitants.  The Priest is knocked down in the panic that ensues and while on the ground catches a glimpse of one of the police officers who..., for a moment... seems to have the face and eyes of a demon.  It turns out there are aliens among us disguised as ordinary people.  They reveal themselves to the Priest and infuse him a strange power that allows him to heal the wounds of any injured person, even bring people back from death.  The Priest finds his faith restored as he goes around healing people, but later learns the terrible cost to the earth that his acceptance of this power, and his covering up the presence of the aliens, is causing as he finds himself to be only a small cog in a much bigger plan.  Great make-up/mask effects in this one.* Under the Bed;  This one is not typical of the Outer Limits series.  No science fiction in this one, it is a myth-based episode with some very spooky moments as two young children are lured away by a strange evil creature. The manhunt ensues, leading the searchers to an old abandoned mine.* Living Hell;  this one had a remarkably gripping story.  A drifter.., is shot in the head by a mugger.  The drifter is rushed to the hospital with severe brain injury, and is saved only by the implanting of an experimental computerized neural chip in his brain. The drifter later discovers that his mind and his motor functions, including his vision,  occasionally get taken over by an accidental linking with another person who has had a similar implant.  The big problem?  The guy who he links up with is a serial murderer and the drifter becomes an unwilling participant in the crimes..., at long distance.  An intense thriller..., as he tries to track down the person committing these crimes.* Dark Matters;  Intense science fiction and supernatural metaphysics combine in this excellent episode about a deep-space freighter that is traveling at light speed and drops out suddenly ... drawn into a pitch black warp anomaly in space where a gigantic chunk of dark-matter is forming the anomaly. It is a limited warp in space that they find they can not escape from, and they find that they are not alone. Is the human soul made of energy?  And if so, could it be trapped in a warp in space forever?  Desperate measures to try to escape, meets up with human and alien ghosts from past trapped vessels invading their ship.* The Conversion; A hapless real estate broker named Henry who sold bad properties and went to jail, is finally released and plots murderous revenge on his former employer and co-conspirator who didn't get punished.  He intrudes upon a dinner party and shoots several people, then runs... having been shot himself by one of the guards there.  He steals a car and drives till he's out of gas and wanders into a bar, where he meets a very unusual stranger who seems to know everything about him..., and wants to help him.  This is a strangely satisfying story reminiscent of the Christmas classic ""It's A Wonderful Life"" , but the stranger Henry meets in the bar is not an angel.  This is a story about a man getting a second chance, a ""replay"" so to speak, to undo the bad choices he made..,  and it tugs on all the emotions but..., it's very very good.* Quality of Mercy; This is a futuristic war story taking place in an alien's prisoner-of-war camp on another world. The Alien planet and Earth are at war.  A human fighter pilot Major Stokes is shot down and captured, and is thrown into a dungeon-like holding cell with another human, a woman who was a cadet in training when she was captured. This is an intense psychological thriller.  The only food to eat is strange live crustaceous bug-like animals tossed into the holding cell once a day, and all the while.., the screams of other captured humans who are being tortured permeates the cell. The Major notices that the young female cadet has a skin graft that looks like the skin of the aliens. She tells him , they are trying to change her into one of them. Which seems to be true as they drag her off several times, each time returning her to the cell looking more and more like one of the native aliens. This is a story about deception and misplaced trust.  The aliens who have captured the Major turn out to be far more cunning and clever than he imagined, and they are determined to win the war against earth.* Caught in the Act; This episode is a cross between Invasion Of The Body Snatchers and Alien.  A very reticent young college girl ,Hannah,  who is very very beautiful, wants only to engage in foreplay and necking with her boyfriend and will not go any further, insisting that they get married before she commits fully.  Needless to say, this leaves her boyfriend frustrated, but he's determined to wait it out, because he loves her. Up to that point, the episode appears to be just standard romantic melodrama.  Then everything changes. A small bullet-shaped meteor crashes through the roof of her house and lodges into the hardwood of her bedroom floor. Hannah is in bed at the time and is startled by the event. She crouches down to examine the strange meteor and something like a large luminescent spider jumps out from inside and clings to her face. It slowly absorbs itself into her body, where it takes on a parasitic symbiotic relationship, driving her to lose all her inhibitions.  The big problem, is that this alien creature eats anyone who makes love to Hannah.  There are some seriously top-notch special effects in this one. But if you're very squeamish about blood and guts, you may want to skip over this episode.* The New Breed; A young scientist designs an amazing new medical nanorobot technology, microscopic robots that can be injected into the bloodstream to repair damaged organs, or change cancerous cells into healthy ones, even prevent diseases and viruses, but..., it's untested on humans, and has yet to be tested on animals. The scientist's friend is diagnosed with a cancerous mass in his back, but when he learns about the technology of the nanorobots, he decides to break into the lab and inject himself with the nanobots. Initially , this turns out to be a cure for his cancer, and the nanobots seem to be protecting him from any and all physical harm internally. But, having thousands of tiny robots roaming around in his body turns out to be not such a great thing. The nanobots begin to overdo things, and the results are horrifying.* The Voyage Home; This is another variation on ""Invasion of the Body Snatchers"" and ""The Thing"". A Mars exploration team has landed and is deep in  a cavern on Mars where they discover what appears to be a form of language carved into the stone.  Beside the carving is a very large ovular object. They try to move it and it spits out a gas-like substance.  When they get back to their space ship , they discover a mold growing inside the ship, which they presume came from the object in the cavern. The mold turns out to be far more than just a fungus.  From there, it's a fairly predictable plot. The tension is ramped up when there are only two crew members left, and one of them isn't human any more.* The Message; This is an elegant and sophisticated science fiction story about a very beautiful deaf woman who has a cochlear implant that did not work as it was hoped, to help restore some of her hearing.  Her doctor upon looking at x-rays has determined that it is not functioning and never will.  But..., the woman insists that she is hearing something, strange voices, speaking in a language she does not understand.  Unlike some of the other episodes in the series, this one does not end with a dire warning or disturbing lesson, but ends on a hopeful and uplifting message.* I, Robot;  This is a remake of the ""I, Robot"" episode from the original 1960's Outer Limits series. This time Leonard Nimoy is the retired lawyer who comes out of retirement for one last great court battle, to defend a robot against the charge of murder. This is better than the original episode, Nimoy carries it all the way with a great performance.* If These walls Could Talk; A guy and girl, maybe in their late teens, decide to spend the night in what can only be described as a classic haunted house.  Perhaps they felt it was the only place they could be alone together.  The dilapidated old victorian era home with its creaking floorboards, drafts, and mysterious sounds begins to disturb the guy, he decides to make sure no one else is there.  He disappears around a corner and screams.  That's the last we see of him ( ...sort of..), the girl goes looking for him, she meets a similar fate.  Was some lunatic hiding in there?  Was it evil spirits? No. A more interesting discovery is made as to the cause of their disappearence, and it's extraterrestrial in nature. This one is a clever mix of horror and science fiction.* Birthright; A senator is involved in a car accident in which he suffers a concussion.  In the hospital, a startled doctor looking at his skull x-ray, sees what appears to be two extra brain lobes that humans should not have and organs in the body scan that she could not identify. The Senator's security team suddenly enters the hospital room, grabs the x-rays, and whisks the Senator off to a hidden location.  He does not understand what's happening, but he's about to discover that he is part of a conspiracy that runs very deep. This episode is actually a very clever twist on a standard alien invasion plot.  Particularly the manner in which they go about using the US political system to manipulate the public into accepting a devious scheme involving changing the environment.- Mike Silverman",5,"A ""MUST

935936,AJYGQV81FSFE2,B000B5IP4W,Timothy P. Scanlon,"[7, 11]","Don't get me wrong. I have the complete old series, and will defend it to the death. But this one, doubtless, has better special effects.I first heard of this new series in the newspaper when it first appeared. The article was on ""I, Robot,"" on how it starred Leonard Nimoy (Who?) as had the original one in the early 1960s. But this one was being directed by Adam, Nimoy's son. That got me hooked before I'd even seen it. Yes, I did see it--that night!As is usually the case, the episodes varied in their quality. There was one two-part, ""The Sandkings,"" with three generations of the Bridges family. That was intriguing. Beau Bridges plays a scientist who gets some life forms from Mars. He loses his funding so takes them home with consequences I'll wait for you to watch and see.One episode, ""White Light Fever"" reminded me of a relative of mine, an elderly person who has kind of worn out his welcome, to be blunt. See it. Then there's ""The Conversion,"" which has a touch of sentimentality to it--a great story. (The point of all of them!)There are familiar faces. Michael Dorn (Star Trek's Worf) is on a voyage returning from Mars in ""The Voyage Home"" which has a great closing message (moral?).There are political comments. In ""The Second Soul,"" a government agent supervising the transfer of dead human bodies to those of a dying alien species grows suspicious. The spokesalien informs him that we humans have not been without sin, using expressions like ""manifest destiny,"" something of which methinks we've lost touch these days.There are some that cross over between the realms of sci fi and the occult, e.g., ""If These Walls Could Talk,"" but it's done with enough taste that it doesn't become silly.I give it four stars only because at least one episode left me disappointed. I think it was ""The Voice of Reason"" which used clips from earlier episodes to put together another episode. That's cheap. Maybe they were having contracting discussions at the time and couldn't put together another episode or something. But I'd have preferred a repeat that clips from prior episodes. Granted, it's not that bad. But it's still cheap. (Star Trek: The Next Generation used to do that once in a while and that got on my nerves).Overall it's excellent. I'm finding sources of the other seasons now.
