I dont think it was meant to be funny but it was. Its one of those ""so bad its funny"" kind of movies. It had bad acting, bad directing, bad broken english and a really bad script that in the end made no dam sense. Even after googling Metatron, i still really couldn't understand the ending. But what really got me wanting to finish watching the movie was: 1) The lead actor who played the alex character was sexy as hell and 2) Every time they would show the possessed character george, i would laugh so hard because he was channeling adam sandler at the height of his retardness! Not that im a big adam sandler fan cause im really not, but this movie was supposedly a serious film but then every now and then that crazy adam sandler thing would pop up and i'd start rollin! You could even see the actor playing the part was tryin not to bust out laughing while he was doing his possessed shtick LOL! So anyway, its definately not a movie worth buying. Maybe its ok for a 99 cent rental. But i think its best to just watch it on cable when its offered as a free movie.",3,Unintentionally funny?,1352505600,"11 10, 2012",2012,1193,"['would', 'have', 'given', 'movie', '2', 'stars', 'parts', 'had', 'laughing', 'ass', 'so', 'hard', 'i', 'just', 'had', 'give', '3', 'stars', 'dont', 'think', 'was', 'meant', 'be', 'funny', 'was', 'one', 'so', 'bad', 'funny', 'kind', 'movies', 'had', 'bad', 'acting', 'bad', 'directing', 'bad', 'broken', 'english', 'really', 'bad', 'script', 'end', 'made', 'dam', 'sense', 'Even', 'googling', 'Metatron', 'i', 'still', 'really', 'could', ""n't"", 'understand', 'ending', 'what', 'really', 'got', 'wanting', 'finish', 'watching', 'movie', 'was', '1', 'lead', 'actor', 'who', 'played', 'alex', 'character', 'was', 'sexy', 'hell', '2', 'time', 'would', 'show', 'possessed', 'character', 'george', 'i', 'would', 'laugh', 'so', 'hard', 'was', 'channeling', 'adam', 'sandler', 'height', 'retardness', 'Not', 'im', 'big', 'adam', 'sandler', 'fan', 'cause', 'im', 'really', 'not', 'movie', 'was', 'supposedly', 'serious', 'film', 'then', 'now', 'then', 'crazy', 'adam', 'sandler', 'thing', 'would', 'pop', 'up', 'i', ""'d"", 'start', 'rollin', 'could', 'even', 'see', 'actor', 'playing', 'part', 'was', 'tryin', 'not', 'bust', 'out', 'laughing', 'was', 'doing', 'possessed', 'shtick', 'LOL', 'So', 'anyway', 'definately', 'not', 'movie', 'worth', 'buying', 'ok', '99', 'cent', 'rental', 'i', 'think', 'best', 'just', 'watch', 'cable', 'when', 'offered', 'free', 'movie']",N/A

BACK FROM HELL takes us on a first-hand journey to hell using the popular ""found-footage"" technique, but with far less success than films like [REC] and THE LAST EXORCISM. Between the awful audio and atrocious accents, it is impossible to understand much of what is being said, not that the cliched dialog that does make it through is even worth listening for. BACK FROM HELL is disastrously boring from start to finish, packing minimal shocks and very little terror in any of the events occurring on screen. A surefire way to drive audiences away from the characters is to have them squabble and fight from the very beginning, making their struggle for survival both empty and emotionless. Any sane person would have stopped filming as soon as their friends start becoming possessed and mutilated, let alone the fact that the camera is left rolling overnight on several occasions for no apparent reason at all. These things and more force us to constantly call into question the choice in style, which is the last thing the audience should be focusing on.

The setting was excellent and combined with the interpersonal tension between the adults created a strong atmosphere. However, something was missing. None of the elements cohered after that.

There is still a priest (Giovanni Guidelli) who lives there. The six people consists of George (Roberto Zibetti) a man with an annoying accent. He believes in ancient astronauts which irks the heck out of Sarah (Manuela Parodi) who is expecting. She has numerous issues with Andrew (Marco Quaglia) the father who she believes secretly doesn't want the child. Claudia (Jennifer Mischiati) is our token eye candy along with her boy friend and atheist Alex (Marco Vannini Gandolfi) who does not believe in spooks. Mark (Aran Bertetto) spends much of his time behind the camera of our found footage film.The beginning part was interesting and I was getting into the film as there was a number of diverse discussions going on plus weird things happening during the seance/Ouija board experiments. I was most impressed with the rapid time in which ""the spirit"" responded, unlike its American counterparts, even when built upon ancient Native-American burial grounds. Most likely their Ouija board was using modern space age graphene receptors. The spirit could understand English and then would spell out answers in Latin. At this point I was loving the film. I couldn't figure out why the hate. Then it happened about midway through...The exorcism scene had me in tears. It was the funniest exorcism since ""Repossessed."" The acting was bad as our victim gnarled his face, drooled, and spoke in unintelligible Latin palindromes. After this, film went down hill with a major WTF scene with a bad prop and really unnecessary plot/shock point that in actuality didn't work well. In fact the whole second half needed to be tightened up. I like where the plot went, I didn't like how it got there and the bad execution of scenes. I thought it was a 4-5 star first half and a 1-2 star second half. The film just went over a cliff.Parental Guide: F-bombs.
