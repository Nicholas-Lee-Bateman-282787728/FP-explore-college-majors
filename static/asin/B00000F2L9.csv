496831,A39IBJB2PBVC7I,B00000F2L9,Alistair McHarg,"[2, 3]","Bob Dylan, Jeff Bridges, Penelope Cruz, John Goodman, Jessica Lange, Luke Wilson, Angela Bassett, Bruce Dern, Ed Harris, Val Kilmer, Cheech Marin, Chris Penn, Giovanni Ribisi, Christian Slater - among others.  With a blockbuster cast like that it's got to be good, right?  Wrong.  This movie is, to paraphrase Churchill's description of Russia, a train wreck wrapped inside a catastrophe.  The fun is seeing all those stars.  The regret is seeing all that talent squandered.  It's like one of those dreadful Altman movies where you spend all your time going, ""Oh my God, that's xyz,"" because actors love him so much they're willing to play hotel clerks, meter maids, and lavatory attendants. The same force is at work here.  Dylan has so much juice that terrific actors jumped at the opportunity to work for peanuts and failed to notice that the concept, script, and direction were staggeringly awful.This said, there are moments, and appropriately enough, they are always isolated.  If you enjoy painfully self-conscious, intentionally murky art house soliloquies, meaningless twaddle disguised as deeply poetic reasoning - and who doesn't? - you'll be pleased.  Ribisi, as a soldier who changes sides as often as you or I might change clothes, delivers the best one, followed by Kilmer who has a Walken-esque gift for deranged, disturbing characters.  Bridges is convincing as a nihilistic, alcoholic journalist whose abrasive, narcissistic pursuit of Dylan must have been very amusing to these insiders, accustomed as they are to fleeing from this type.  The absolute lack of plot and character provided some participants with motivation to act, presumably in hopes of causing something to happen.  In addition to Bridges, Goodman and Lange give it the old school try.  By contrast, Dylan seems to be sleepwalking through the entire effort, expressing absolutely no emotional range whatsoever.  Perhaps, since everyone else can do a good Bob Dylan impression, he didn't feel the need to do a good one himself.Larry Charles shoulders the directorial shame, and shares the writing shame with Dylan.  A generous soul might say that some of the alleged third world footage (actually L.A.) shares the same stream of conscious feeling one gets from Dylan's better songs, jarring imagery, disjointed, haunting thoughts.  A generous soul might say that the twin themes of social revolution and musical posturing manipulated by the media says a great deal about where pop culture stands today as opposed to where it stood when we all believed that the times really were a changing.  A generous soul might.  But that generous soul ain't me.

496833,A1UNXVMM0JCVLK,B00000F2L9,"B B McGuire ""Buster""","[11, 13]","I purchased this DVD with my eyes wide open, because I had been forwarned by reviewers I respect, and I still place Dylan's 1977 ""Renaldo and Clara"" near the top of my most pretentiuos doo doo list. But wait, that was almost 30 years ago and this movie stars Jeff Bridges AND John Goodman (the Dude abides), also Jessica Lange, Giovanni Ribisi, Val Kilmer, Bruce Dern, Mickey Rourke and was co-written and directed by Larry Charles of Seinfeld and Friends fame, so how bad could it be?Well I planned on watching it one night but after about 30 minutes became fatiqued and fell asleep. This went on for about 3 more nights until I finally finished the movie. The week before I had watched the uncut ""Heaven's Gate"" (nearly 4 hours), a deliberate slowly paced film, in one sitting, and yet ""M and A"" seemed so much longer. I also skipped watching the few deleted scenes (something I can't remember ever doing), and went straight for the ""Making Of"" and watched and listened to those involved talking about the great script and a movie I can't remember seeing.I realize now that deleted scenes would be overkill since the entire movie seems like it's just a bunch of strung together deleted scenes. This is not to say the movie is unwatchable, I had kept coming back to it night after night, in fact there are some very entertaining and surreal moments in the film, I just wish there had been more of them. For starters I would have liked to have seen more of Ribisi, for he was the most focused in his part (though it also seemed like he was in another movie), they could have beefed up the Christian Slater-Chris Penn bits or even made them the main characters and created a sort of Abbott and Costello Meet Jack Fate. Val Kilmer was great, but he disappeared too soon, and some of the songs Dylan did with his band were pretty good, but they could have given the young girl (Tinashe Kachingwe), who stole the show singing ""The Times They Are A-Changin'"", more of Dylan's songs to sing.The best part of the film for me was Jeff Bridges as a Dudesque reporter asking Dylan's Jack Fate lots of bizarre questions, in fact a short that just edited together all these bits would be enjoyable.I guess that's most of the good stuff, but on the other hand, I wish they had removed the entire subplot concerning his dying father (Richard Sarafian) Angela Bassett, and Mickey Rourke, and despite old man makeup, his father still looks younger than Bob (things must have been pretty bad in prison).Less of Lange and Goodman would have made it less irratating, and Luke Wilson and particularly Penelope Cruz should have ended up on the cuttingroom floor. I'm not sure what to make of Ed Harris in black-face except that I felt like he was a refugee from some old Fellini film.Bob Dylan acts like he sings which isn't so bad in a film where  many of the other actors are so over-the-top, and watching him is like looking at an abstract painting, it doesn't ever change but you keep looking at it to try and find some inner meaning.This is Larry Charles first film and judging by his TV work you would have expected it to be at least funny, but where ""Seinfeld"" was supposed to be a TV show about nothing but was actually about alot, this movie really is about nothing.",2,A movie about nothing,1144454400,"04 8, 2006",2006,3254,"['purchased', 'DVD', 'eyes', 'wide', 'open', 'had', 'been', 'forwarned', 'reviewers', 'respect', 'still', 'place', 'Dylan', '1977', 'Renaldo', 'Clara', 'top', 'most', 'pretentiuos', 'doo', 'doo', 'list', 'wait', 'was', 'almost', '30', 'years', 'ago', 'movie', 'Jeff', 'Bridges', 'AND', 'John', 'Goodman', 'Dude', 'abides', 'also', 'Jessica', 'Lange', 'Giovanni', 'Ribisi', 'Val', 'Kilmer', 'Bruce', 'Dern', 'Mickey', 'Rourke', 'was', 'co-written', 'directed', 'Larry', 'Charles', 'Seinfeld', 'Friends', 'fame', 'how', 'bad', 'could', 'be', 'Well', 'planned', 'watching', 'one', 'night', '30', 'minutes', 'became', 'fatiqued', 'fell', 'asleep', 'went', '3', 'more', 'nights', 'finally', 'finished', 'movie', 'week', 'had', 'watched', 'uncut', 'Heaven', 'Gate', 'nearly', '4', 'hours', 'deliberate', 'slowly', 'paced', 'film', 'one', 'sitting', 'yet', 'M', 'A', 'seemed', 'so', 'much', 'longer', 'also', 'skipped', 'watching', 'few', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'something', 'ca', ""n't"", 'remember', 'ever', 'doing', 'went', 'straight', 'Making', 'watched', 'listened', 'involved', 'talking', 'great', 'script', 'movie', 'ca', ""n't"", 'remember', 'seeing.I', 'realize', 'now', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'would', 'be', 'overkill', 'entire', 'movie', 'just', 'bunch', 'strung', 'together', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'not', 'say', 'movie', 'unwatchable', 'had', 'kept', 'coming', 'back', 'night', 'night', 'fact', 'are', 'very', 'entertaining', 'surreal', 'moments', 'film', 'just', 'wish', 'had', 'been', 'more', 'starters', 'would', 'have', 'liked', 'have', 'seen', 'more', 'Ribisi', 'was', 'most', 'focused', 'part', 'also', 'seemed', 'was', 'movie', 'could', 'have', 'beefed', 'up', 'Christian', 'Slater-Chris', 'Penn', 'even', 'made', 'main', 'characters', 'created', 'sort', 'Abbott', 'Costello', 'Meet', 'Jack', 'Fate', 'Val', 'Kilmer', 'was', 'great', 'disappeared', 'too', 'soon', 'songs', 'Dylan', 'did', 'band', 'were', 'pretty', 'good', 'could', 'have', 'given', 'young', 'girl', 'Tinashe', 'Kachingwe', 'who', 'stole', 'show', 'singing', 'Times', 'Are', 'A-Changin', 'more', 'Dylan', 'songs', 'sing.The', 'best', 'part', 'film', 'was', 'Jeff', 'Bridges', 'Dudesque', 'reporter', 'asking', 'Dylan', 'Jack', 'Fate', 'lots', 'bizarre', 'questions', 'fact', 'short', 'just', 'edited', 'together', 'bits', 'would', 'be', 'enjoyable.I', 'guess', 'most', 'good', 'stuff', 'other', 'hand', 'wish', 'had', 'removed', 'entire', 'subplot', 'concerning', 'dying', 'father', 'Richard', 'Sarafian', 'Angela', 'Bassett', 'Mickey', 'Rourke', 'old', 'man', 'makeup', 'father', 'still', 'younger', 'Bob', 'things', 'must', 'have', 'been', 'pretty', 'bad', 'prison', '.Less', 'Lange', 'Goodman', 'would', 'have', 'made', 'less', 'irratating', 'Luke', 'Wilson', 'particularly', 'Penelope', 'Cruz', 'should', 'have', 'ended', 'up', 'cuttingroom', 'floor', ""'m"", 'not', 'sure', 'what', 'make', 'Ed', 'Harris', 'black-face', 'felt', 'was', 'refugee', 'old', 'Fellini', 'film.Bob', 'Dylan', ""n't"", 'so', 'bad', 'film', 'where', 'many', 'other', 'actors', 'are', 'so', 'over-the-top', 'watching', 'looking', 'abstract', 'painting', ""n't"", 'ever', 'change', 'keep', 'looking', 'try', 'find', 'inner', 'meaning.This', 'Larry', 'Charles', 'first', 'film', 'judging', 'TV', 'work', 'would', 'have', 'expected', 'be', 'least', 'funny', 'where', 'Seinfeld', 'was', 'supposed', 'be', 'TV', 'show', 'nothing', 'was', 'actually', 'alot', 'movie', 'really', 'nothing']",Masked and Anonymous

Leaving through the wrong door, I found myself outside with no way to reenter except through the lobby. Would I be stopped and asked to produce the ticket stub that I feared I had thrown away?I returned to the theater without incident, no questions asked. But I had questions of my own, notably what is the point of ""Masked and Anonymous""? In retrospect, I suppose there is no easy answer. One can't explain ""Masked and Anonymous"" any more than one can explain ""Visions of Johanna"" or ""Desolation Row,"" or dozens of other Dylan songs. It is what it is, and you either get it or you don't.I'm not sure I get it, but I can't say I didn't have fun trying. For die-hard Dylan fans, ""Masked and Anonymous"" should be worthwhile. For someone whose CD collection includes ""Blood on the Tracks"" and ""Greatest Hits,"" but not ""Self-Portrait"" and ""Knocked Out Loaded,"" this film may inspire more impatient head-scratching than enjoyment. Those who have followed Dylan's career through the main roads, as well as the back-alleys, may find ""Masked and Anonymous"" rewarding.Both should be pleased with the music. It's great to hear the brilliant ""Blind Willie McTell"" on the soundtrack, but best of all is the concert footage, including a terrific and all too brief version of ""Dixie,"" and a pleasant take on ""I'll Remember You,"" a track not available on the officially released soundtrack.As for the acting, John Goodman and Jeff Bridges give their all, while Dylan remains distant, as enigmatic as ever, a guest in his own film. The most amusing moment may be in the TV network's boardroom when we glimpse a schedule of programming that features shows with titles lifted from the Dylan songbook.""Masked and Anonymous"" is for the Dylan faithful.

496835,A22EJFDZLDAXES,B00000F2L9,"Carlo Matthews ""carlo""","[6, 16]","Far from a fitting way to approach the end of one's career, this production finds Dylan surrounded by yes-men ready to worship his every thought, his every accomplishment with nauseating adulation.  To make things worse, the cast of stars here seems lifted from those who feel desperate to be seen paying homage to the man, grovelling to be in the limelight next to Dylan before Dylan is no more.The movie itself, particularly the plot, is a thinly disguised yarn of Dylan's career, focusing on his latter years, the forgotten hero, and the birth of the mother of all comebacks:  Playing a concert to save the world, or some such thing.  Such embarrassing stuff would make good self-mockery of an artist of lesser statue.  With Dylan, however, it comes across as pathetic:  the man pays homage to himself, brayed on by a cast of hangers-on.  Truly sad.Now for the acting and the script.  Bob is as expressive as a plank of wood.  To say anything less than that would be sheer praise.  The others are perfunctory, only there to get Bob through it all. And the script is just as miserable. Thankfully, Bob does not have so many lines himself, but his 'pearls of wisdom' are thrown in as disembodied reflections at 'crucial' moments between scenes, an irritating and repetitive technique that only adds a sense sanctimonious phoniness to an already phony-soaked production.  Honestly, whoever directed this should be banned from future film work.In all, the movie is a shocker of poor taste and abysmal judgement, revealing much more about those behind/in it, than about the story itself.  After the great ""Love & Theft"" album, it is nothing short of distressing to see Dylan stoop to such depths, tarnishing what would otherwise have been a brilliant end to a brilliant career.Now maybe if the movie had been done as a cartoon, it would have worked wonderfully!!!",1,Pathetic Self-Deification,1078963200,"03 11, 2004",2004,1861,"['Far', 'fitting', 'way', 'approach', 'end', 'one', 'career', 'production', 'Dylan', 'surrounded', 'yes-men', 'ready', 'worship', 'thought', 'accomplishment', 'nauseating', 'adulation', 'make', 'things', 'worse', 'cast', 'stars', 'here', 'lifted', 'who', 'feel', 'desperate', 'be', 'seen', 'paying', 'homage', 'man', 'grovelling', 'be', 'limelight', 'Dylan', 'Dylan', 'more.The', 'movie', 'particularly', 'plot', 'thinly', 'disguised', 'yarn', 'Dylan', 'career', 'focusing', 'latter', 'years', 'forgotten', 'hero', 'birth', 'mother', 'comebacks', 'Playing', 'concert', 'save', 'world', 'such', 'thing', 'Such', 'embarrassing', 'stuff', 'would', 'make', 'good', 'self-mockery', 'artist', 'lesser', 'statue', 'Dylan', 'however', 'pathetic', 'man', 'homage', 'brayed', 'cast', 'hangers-on', 'Truly', 'sad.Now', 'acting', 'script', 'Bob', 'as', 'expressive', 'plank', 'wood', 'say', 'anything', 'less', 'would', 'be', 'sheer', 'praise', 'others', 'are', 'perfunctory', 'only', 'there', 'get', 'Bob', 'script', 'just', 'miserable', 'Thankfully', 'Bob', 'not', 'have', 'so', 'many', 'lines', ""'pearls"", 'wisdom', 'are', 'thrown', 'as', 'disembodied', 'reflections', ""'crucial"", 'moments', 'scenes', 'irritating', 'repetitive', 'technique', 'only', 'sense', 'sanctimonious', 'phoniness', 'already', 'phony-soaked', 'production', 'Honestly', 'whoever', 'directed', 'should', 'be', 'banned', 'future', 'film', 'movie', 'shocker', 'poor', 'taste', 'abysmal', 'judgement', 'revealing', 'much', 'more', 'behind/in', 'story', 'great', 'Love', 'Theft', 'album', 'nothing', 'short', 'distressing', 'see', 'Dylan', 'stoop', 'such', 'depths', 'tarnishing', 'what', 'would', 'otherwise', 'have', 'been', 'brilliant', 'end', 'brilliant', 'career.Now', 'maybe', 'movie', 'had', 'been', 'done', 'cartoon', 'would', 'have', 'worked', 'wonderfully']",Masked and Anonymous

It suits you.======================================The first time I tried to watch Masked & Anonymous I got to the part where Jack Fate sings for the first time since being released from prison and I couldn't understand a word he was singing. I gave up and went to sleep. The next morning I woke up refreshed and gave it another try. When I heard ""My Back Pages"" performed by Mogokoro Brothers as kind of a hip hop thing done in a foreign language (Spanish?) I knew I was going to enjoy the movie. The sound track is chock full of Bob Dylan songs, done everywhich way, from The Golden Gate Strings, or Percy Faith and his Orchestra, to The Ramones, or Los Lobos. Pulled in by his music, I had no trouble understanding the words of Jack Fate, alias Bob Dylan.-----------------------------------Jack Fate: I was always a singer and maybe no more then that. Sometimes it's not enough to know the meaning of things, sometimes we have to know what things don't mean as well. Like what does it mean to not know what the person you love is capable of? Things fall apart, especially all the neat order of rules and laws. The way we look at the world is the way we really are. See it from a fair garden and everything looks cheerful. Climb to a higher plateau and you'll see plunder and murder. Truth and beauty are in the eye of the beholder. I stopped trying to figure everything out a long time ago.==============================================The movie takes place in a politically unstable future, like some South American country always on the verge of another coup, another revolution. Jack Fate is in jail, but Nina Veronica (Jessica Lange) and Uncle Sweetheart (John Goodman) have plans to spring him so he can play a big benefit concert. It would mostly benefit them, of course, but The Network is not really aware of just how big a legend Jack Fate is. Still, they can get him cheap, and so the show will go on. Meanwhile journalist Tom Friendly (Jeff Bridges) is assigned to do a story or an interview on the man, and Tom reluctantly brings along his young girlfriend, Pagan Lace Pen&eacute;lope Cruz).But don't let the plot get in the way of the story, because the movie is really a fable or a metaphor for the career and life of Bob Dylan. How he approached the life of a traveling folk singer as a kind of poet, but then became a prisoner of his own fame. Where his poems came from he didn't know himself, they kind of just went through him. He saw flaming letters and wrote down what they spelled out. People thought he had the answers. They thought he had all the answers and was just sitting on them, like a dragon guarding a decaying horde of gold that wasn't doing anybody any good. Obsessed fans went through his trash and harrassed him because he refused to give them the answers they knew he had stashed away.------------------Jack Fate: By the way, which side of the political fence are you on?Desk Clerk: I do not belong to any political party, sir. I guess you could call me... a feminist=============================The movie was written by Bob Dylan and Larry Charles under assumed names, because they were masked and anonymous. Dylan was Sergei Petrov and Charles was Rene Fontaine. Mr. Charles was a writer for Seinfeld and then he had his own show, Curb Your Enthusiasm. Larry Charles directed it, his first feature film, and they knocked it out in 20 days, filming on digital video. A stellar cast worked for much less than usual for the chance to be in a movie with Dylan. They were honored to be included, as well they should.A high point in the movie is when a very young black woman (Tinashe Kachingwe) sings ""The Times They Are A-Changin'"" Even a tool of a critic who trashed the movie and called it a vanity project was moved by this scene. There are many interesting versions of Dylan's music performed for the soundtrack. Virtually all of the songs were written by him, and he also contributes quite a few performances of his own music. Masked and Anonymous is a great film, but if you don't 'get' Bob Dylan, then you probably will be perplexed by it. Sometimes it's not enough to know the meaning of things, sometimes we have to know what things don't mean as well.-----Soldier: I wish I could live in my dreams.

496837,ABN5K7K1TM1QA,B00000F2L9,Dennis Littrell,"[3, 3]","The ""mask"" could be Dylan's face so stoically does he hold his expression.  And the ""anonymous"" could be any tin horn banana republic dictator.  As The Who phrased it years ago: ""The new boss, just like the old boss.""The surprising thing about this film is how good it is.  Clearly experimental in form (which often equals boring) Masked and Anonymous is instead a fascinating work of art with outstanding performances amid a meandering chaos replete with cunning little speeches that defy analysis.  I was not really surprised to learn that credited screenwriter ""Sergei Petrov"" is really Bob Dylan.  Kudos to him and to ""Rene Fontaine"" (actually Larry Charles of ""Seinfeld"" fame) for coming up with this little gem.However I have to say that without Dylan's music and the fine cast this could have been an unmitigated disaster.One of the things I love about Bob Dylan is the intensity.  It's always there.  He never stops.  It's as though the next lyric will be the line to end all lines (pun intended) or that the next musical hook will exhaust the music.Like Emily Dickinson he invented a new kind of poetry that confounded the poetic establishment and confused academia.  When I first heard Dylan's lyrics in the sixties referred to as poetry, I was an undergraduate at UCLA and thought (apparently along with Carl Sandburg): this ain't poetry.  It's all cliches.  And it is.  But what Bob Dylan did was to use the phrases and the cliches and the rhythms of our world as the poet uses words.  The cliches became the building blocks of his poems.  And of course they filled his head to overflowing, echoing and ricocheting around in his mind like the wares of Quinn the Eskimo running all around his brain.  And they had to get out, and he tossed them out with tune after tune and a lyric to string them together, and he ended up writing some of best poetry of the latter half of the 20th century.  But of course his poetry, like that of all song writers does not stand entirely alone without its music.  Still his phrases that look into our soul and chronicle our times are as indelible as the color of our skin.  It is no coincidence that in the age of the soundbite, Dylan wrote his poems in soundbites.Like the 19th century academics who wanted to edit Emily Dickinson's poetry and improve her meter and adjust her ""imperfect"" (slant) rhymes and normalize her punctuation, the academic world of the 20th century wanted to get Dylan to eschew cliche.  But what they missed is the poet knows the language better than they and his cliches are in the modules of our minds.  They are the wings of the zeitgeist and the linguist's meme.Goodman was perfect as Uncle Sweetheart who might be a deeply buried persona of Dylan with his cryptic one-liners and his desolation soul, his corrupted heart and his huge appetite for life.  And Jessica Lange was also excellent as were the cameos by all sorts of name actors appearing on stage to confront a stoic Dylan.  In a way they were intriguing and perhaps nothing more than that.  Like Shakespearean players they came and had their time upon the stage and were heard no more.Yes, this film seems to signify in the final analysis not much, but, isn't that the point of life: there is no point.  Life is that tale by an idiot signifying nothing.Here's a nice string of quotes from the cynic, Jack Fate, Dylan's alter ego: ""I was always a singer and maybe no more than that. Sometimes it's not enough to know the meaning of things, sometimes we have to know what things don't mean as well...Things fall apart...The way we look at the world is what we really are. See it from a fair garden and everything looks cheerful. Climb to a higher plateau and you'll see plunder and murder. Truth and beauty are in the eye of the beholder...I don't pay much attention to my dreams...I stopped trying to figure everything out a long time ago...""I have only one criticism of this film: I wish there had been a lot more of the hauntingly beautiful Penelope Cruz.",5,Dylan self-analyzes in public--but cryptically,1137369600,"01 16, 2006",2006,3993,"['mask', 'could', 'be', 'Dylan', 'face', 'so', 'stoically', 'hold', 'expression', 'anonymous', 'could', 'be', 'tin', 'horn', 'republic', 'dictator', 'Who', 'phrased', 'years', 'ago', 'new', 'boss', 'just', 'old', 'boss', 'surprising', 'thing', 'film', 'how', 'good', 'Clearly', 'experimental', 'form', 'often', 'boring', 'Masked', 'Anonymous', 'instead', 'fascinating', 'work', 'art', 'outstanding', 'performances', 'meandering', 'chaos', 'replete', 'cunning', 'little', 'speeches', 'defy', 'analysis', 'was', 'not', 'really', 'surprised', 'learn', 'credited', 'screenwriter', 'Sergei', 'Petrov', 'really', 'Bob', 'Dylan', 'Kudos', 'Rene', 'Fontaine', 'actually', 'Larry', 'Charles', 'Seinfeld', 'fame', 'coming', 'up', 'little', 'gem.However', 'have', 'say', 'Dylan', 'music', 'fine', 'cast', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'unmitigated', 'disaster.One', 'things', 'love', 'Bob', 'Dylan', 'intensity', 'always', 'there', 'never', 'next', 'lyric', 'will', 'be', 'line', 'end', 'lines', 'pun', 'intended', 'next', 'musical', 'hook', 'will', 'exhaust', 'music.Like', 'Emily', 'Dickinson', 'invented', 'new', 'kind', 'poetry', 'confounded', 'poetic', 'establishment', 'confused', 'academia', 'When', 'first', 'heard', 'Dylan', 'lyrics', 'sixties', 'referred', 'poetry', 'was', 'undergraduate', 'UCLA', 'thought', 'apparently', 'Carl', 'Sandburg', 'ai', ""n't"", 'poetry', 'cliches', 'what', 'Bob', 'Dylan', 'did', 'was', 'use', 'phrases', 'cliches', 'rhythms', 'world', 'poet', 'words', 'cliches', 'became', 'building', 'blocks', 'poems', 'course', 'filled', 'head', 'overflowing', 'echoing', 'ricocheting', 'around', 'mind', 'wares', 'Quinn', 'Eskimo', 'running', 'brain', 'had', 'get', 'out', 'tossed', 'out', 'tune', 'tune', 'lyric', 'string', 'together', 'ended', 'up', 'writing', 'best', 'poetry', 'latter', 'half', '20th', 'century', 'course', 'poetry', 'song', 'writers', 'not', 'stand', 'entirely', 'alone', 'music', 'Still', 'phrases', 'look', 'soul', 'chronicle', 'times', 'are', 'as', 'indelible', 'color', 'skin', 'coincidence', 'age', 'soundbite', 'Dylan', 'wrote', 'poems', 'soundbites.Like', '19th', 'century', 'academics', 'who', 'wanted', 'edit', 'Emily', 'Dickinson', 'poetry', 'improve', 'meter', 'adjust', 'imperfect', 'slant', 'rhymes', 'normalize', 'punctuation', 'academic', 'world', '20th', 'century', 'wanted', 'get', 'Dylan', 'eschew', 'cliche', 'what', 'missed', 'poet', 'language', 'better', 'cliches', 'are', 'modules', 'minds', 'are', 'wings', 'zeitgeist', 'linguist', 'meme.Goodman', 'was', 'perfect', 'Uncle', 'Sweetheart', 'who', 'might', 'be', 'deeply', 'buried', 'persona', 'Dylan', 'cryptic', 'one-liners', 'desolation', 'soul', 'corrupted', 'heart', 'huge', 'appetite', 'life', 'Jessica', 'Lange', 'was', 'also', 'excellent', 'were', 'cameos', 'sorts', 'name', 'actors', 'appearing', 'stage', 'confront', 'stoic', 'Dylan', 'way', 'were', 'intriguing', 'perhaps', 'nothing', 'more', 'Shakespearean', 'players', 'came', 'had', 'time', 'stage', 'were', 'heard', 'more.Yes', 'film', 'signify', 'final', 'analysis', 'not', 'much', ""n't"", 'point', 'life', 'point', 'Life', 'tale', 'idiot', 'signifying', 'nothing.Here', 'nice', 'string', 'quotes', 'cynic', 'Jack', 'Fate', 'Dylan', 'alter', 'ego', 'was', 'always', 'singer', 'maybe', 'more', 'not', 'enough', 'know', 'meaning', 'things', 'sometimes', 'have', 'know', 'what', 'things', 'do', ""n't"", 'mean', 'as', 'well', 'Things', 'fall', 'apart', 'way', 'look', 'world', 'what', 'really', 'are', 'See', 'fair', 'garden', 'everything', 'looks', 'cheerful', 'Climb', 'higher', 'plateau', ""'ll"", 'see', 'plunder', 'murder', 'Truth', 'beauty', 'are', 'eye', 'beholder', 'do', ""n't"", 'pay', 'much', 'attention', 'dreams', 'stopped', 'trying', 'figure', 'everything', 'out', 'long', 'time', 'have', 'only', 'one', 'criticism', 'film', 'wish', 'had', 'been', 'lot', 'more', 'hauntingly', 'beautiful', 'Penelope', 'Cruz']",Masked and Anonymous

Repeated viewings would doubtless be rewarding, and I plan to watch it again, preferably with folks who know more about the history of the blues.  Dylan is the ""simple"" bard making his way through an apocalyptic society torn by dictatorship, corruption, and civil war -- a contemporary Hell. (The sets have a prescient and eerie resemblance to footage coming out of Iraq.)  If Dylan is Virgil, it is by virtue of the songs themselves, poetic ballads that address the profound questions, yet whose significance, as Dylan comments at the end of the film, remains in the eyes of the beholder.  Hearing the songs covered by other artists provides a fresh window on their brilliance, and there is a little girl who will break your heart with her georgeously-phrased a cappella version of ""The Times They Are A-Changin'.""  There are also some spectacular Pynchon-like stream of consciousness monologues by a cadre of talented actors on various themes, often punctuated at the end by a cryptic/irreverent/oracular comment from Dylan.  I was entertained by the juxtaposition of silly humor, which in some instances resonated with the more nuanced literary points, such as the leopard joke (""What did the monkey say to the leopard at the card game? I thought you were a cheetah."")which nevertheless evokes the leopard Dante encounters in the first canto of The Inferno.  And unlike some other reviewers, I found Dylan's acting pretty natural, and got the sense he actually did lay it on the line with respect to his personal viewpoint.  This is not to say the film is a total success -- but rather even where it veers into obscure digression and fails to engage the audience, it fails nobly by aspiring to be all that film can be.",5,Dylan as Virgil in the inferno of postmodern society,1083196800,"04 29, 2004",2004,1863,"['ambitious', 'film', 'dense', 'metaphor', 'allusion', 'was', 'left', 'feeling', 'comprehended', 'mere', 'fraction', 'Repeated', 'viewings', 'would', 'doubtless', 'be', 'rewarding', 'plan', 'watch', 'again', 'preferably', 'folks', 'who', 'know', 'more', 'history', 'blues', 'Dylan', 'simple', 'bard', 'making', 'way', 'apocalyptic', 'society', 'torn', 'dictatorship', 'corruption', 'civil', 'war', 'contemporary', 'Hell', 'sets', 'have', 'prescient', 'eerie', 'resemblance', 'footage', 'coming', 'Iraq', 'Dylan', 'Virgil', 'virtue', 'songs', 'poetic', 'ballads', 'address', 'profound', 'questions', 'yet', 'significance', 'Dylan', 'comments', 'end', 'film', 'eyes', 'beholder', 'Hearing', 'songs', 'covered', 'other', 'artists', 'fresh', 'window', 'brilliance', 'little', 'girl', 'who', 'will', 'break', 'heart', 'georgeously-phrased', 'cappella', 'version', 'Times', 'Are', 'A-Changin', 'are', 'also', 'spectacular', 'Pynchon-like', 'stream', 'consciousness', 'monologues', 'cadre', 'talented', 'actors', 'various', 'themes', 'often', 'punctuated', 'end', 'cryptic/irreverent/oracular', 'comment', 'Dylan', 'was', 'entertained', 'juxtaposition', 'silly', 'humor', 'instances', 'resonated', 'more', 'nuanced', 'literary', 'points', 'such', 'leopard', 'joke', 'What', 'did', 'monkey', 'say', 'leopard', 'card', 'game', 'thought', 'were', 'cheetah', 'nevertheless', 'leopard', 'Dante', 'first', 'canto', 'Inferno', 'other', 'reviewers', 'found', 'Dylan', 'acting', 'pretty', 'natural', 'got', 'sense', 'actually', 'did', 'lay', 'line', 'respect', 'personal', 'viewpoint', 'not', 'say', 'film', 'total', 'success', 'rather', 'even', 'where', 'obscure', 'digression', 'engage', 'audience', 'nobly', 'aspiring', 'be', 'film', 'can', 'be']",Masked and Anonymous

This film was a pet project for him, and somehow he recruited a plethora of excellent people to be involved in what became a clunky movie. It is a very dark Sci-Fi/Musical/Adventure/Comedy. It is part political allegory, and part fairy tale--with a healthy dash of rock video for zest.Bob Dylan is the pivotal character, and gets the most screen time. I can't get over how much he is looking like a short Vincent Price these days, what with his thin haggard face and pencil thin goatee. Dylan is getting a lot of press these days, since Martin Scorsese released the new documentary on him--shown first on PBS, and released immediately in DVD.The world of the near distant future seems to be a mess--rife with revolution and anarchy. The president of the US, who looks like a Central American dictator reject, is dying of a social disease secondary to his pedophilia. Bob Dylan is supposed to be his prodigal son--who once had a career as protest rock star (some stretch for Dylan), and who has been cooling his heels in a filthy prison as a political prisoner.The film swarms with big stars doing cameos and small roles. It is the kind of independent small film that might have been a real classic, but has ended up a poorly edited mish-mash. Yet, having said that, I wouldn't be surprised if some day it reached a kind of cult status for its use of Bob Dylan and all those stars--kind of a grand and noble close call to greatness--a film almost impossible to fully comprehend--a plot almost too silly to reflect. Yet a movie that stays with you, irritating your intellect.John Goodman rants and raves as a sleezy con man promoter. Jessica Lange looks great as his producer partner, although her dialogue makes very little sense. Giovanni Ribissi had a nice scene as a burned out freedom fighter. Jeff Bridges plays a burned out alcoholic reporter, who carries a gun, and gets beat up a lot--after spouting divers non-sequiters and poetry. Penelope Cruz wanders about lost as his religious zealot, ex-whore girlfriend--crossing herself hundreds of times just prior to and following all the scenes she is in. Mickey Rourke plays a gangster White House Chief of Staff, who takes over the country once the President dies. He is supposed to be a childhood friend of Dylan's--a foundling that El Presidente raised and kept beside him. Christian Slater and Chris Penn play philosophizing stage hands who do a poor imitation of a Greek Chorus--and mostly stand around with their arms crossed, looking perplexed.But Bob Dylan is the focus--if there is one. He and his band perform 8 or 10 songs, and it is fun to watch him and listen to him--although he mumbles so much half of the lyrics are lost--even to the engineers who struggled to make them audible. This film will entertain you, and perplex you. I liked it, even though it played out like a rough cut, and the religious existential apocalyptic images do not mesh well.

496844,A3QAQUUPFIARWB,B00000F2L9,"Gord Wilson ""alivingdog.com""","[0, 0]","This is rated PG-13, but it's a must for any Dylan fan. From the blurbs and reviews, one can piece together the story, so I won't recount it. It most reminds me of the Sam Shephard (sp.) plays I've seen performed and acted in. There's a bit that seems almost taken from T-Bone Burnett's Truth Decay album, and has the same intonation and delivery. There's a band that includes Charlie Sexton, who joined Dylan's band after recording two Tonio-K songs. Full of rare genius, this film has the usual suspects' fingerprints all over it.The last three films I watched had John Goodman in them, but here he outdoes himself in a performance that may equal that in O Brother, Where Art Thou? Val Kilmer hints at hidden depths and could have excelled in a wider part. Jeff Bridges as the writer delivers a curiously muted performance. In my view, he simply doesn't have John Goodman's command of language. However, he could be playing The Big Lebowski (sp.), this so easily slips into Coen Bros. /T-Bone Burnett territory. The natural in this film, however, is Jessica Lange. Hers is an Oscar winning performance (if films like this were ever considered for Oscars).What of Dylan? I most enjoyed watching him perform, and likely don't have the same view of that as some other reviewers. I thought he was rather forced on 'Dixie"" and the other folk songs, mostly because people know how those go and expect a certain sort of rendering. But Dylan's originals are his own. There's a tremendous version of ""I'll Remember You,"" unplugged and far slower than whatever album it appeared on. There's also one verse of ""Blind Willie McTell"", which is on the third disc of Bootleg Series Vol. 1-3. Also in that boxed CD set is a dazzling number called ""Angelina"". An instrumental version of ""Angelina"" plays near the end of the film, but the lyrics are never sung.I eagerly searched for the CD soundtrack, thinking these songs would be on it, but they're not. Some critics have found this film to be pretentious and self-conscious. I found it anything but. There is some overdubbed talking, apparently in the first person by Dylan persona Jack Fate, which may fall into that category, and there is a Jeff Bridges monologue I would have edited out. Some of the Jack Fate parts sound like they could have been Dylan reading his autobiography. The actual character rarely speaks in the film, and doesn't seem too far removed from the riverboat gambler of Love and Theft. I would have liked T-Bone Burnett to have been in this film, but of course he's busy with his Coen Bros. projects, producing and, I hope, re-releasing Proof Through the Night and Trap Door for those of us who missed the Rhino limited edition release.The photography is amazing. The iconography seems taken from the cover of the little heard Dylan album, Knocked Out Loaded, which perhaps helped inspire it. Dylan is one of the few performers at home in both French and Spanish culture. He regularly performs at the New Orleans jazz festivals, and is here at home among references to Hemmingway and other expatriates. Finally, the writing in this film is amazing. Where are you going? Jack Fate asks a fellow traveller at a bus stop. ""This way,"" he replies. ""Another good way is that way"" or words to that effect. ""Masked"" captures Dylan in perhaps his most natural persona, and one to which many can relate, that of the wanderer. It walks into serious business indeed, without taking itself too seriously, and proves that art house need not be arty.",5,Art House Dylan,1222992000,"10 3, 2008",2008,3498,"['rated', 'PG-13', 'must', 'Dylan', 'fan', 'blurbs', 'reviews', 'one', 'can', 'piece', 'together', 'story', 'wo', ""n't"", 'recount', 'most', 'Sam', 'Shephard', 'sp', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'performed', 'acted', 'bit', 'almost', 'taken', 'T-Bone', 'Burnett', 'Truth', 'Decay', 'album', 'same', 'intonation', 'delivery', 'band', 'Charlie', 'Sexton', 'who', 'joined', 'Dylan', 'band', 'recording', 'two', 'Tonio-K', 'songs', 'Full', 'rare', 'genius', 'film', 'usual', 'suspects', 'fingerprints', 'it.The', 'last', 'three', 'films', 'watched', 'had', 'John', 'Goodman', 'here', 'performance', 'may', 'equal', 'O', 'Brother', 'Where', 'Art', 'Thou', 'Val', 'Kilmer', 'hints', 'hidden', 'depths', 'could', 'have', 'excelled', 'wider', 'part', 'Jeff', 'Bridges', 'writer', 'curiously', 'muted', 'performance', 'view', 'simply', ""n't"", 'have', 'John', 'Goodman', 'command', 'language', 'However', 'could', 'be', 'playing', 'Big', 'Lebowski', 'sp', 'so', 'easily', 'Coen', 'Bros.', '/T-Bone', 'Burnett', 'territory', 'natural', 'film', 'however', 'Jessica', 'Lange', 'Hers', 'Oscar', 'winning', 'performance', 'films', 'were', 'ever', 'considered', 'Oscars', '.What', 'Dylan', 'most', 'enjoyed', 'watching', 'perform', 'likely', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'same', 'view', 'other', 'reviewers', 'thought', 'was', 'rather', 'forced', ""'Dixie"", 'other', 'folk', 'songs', 'mostly', 'people', 'know', 'how', 'go', 'expect', 'certain', 'sort', 'rendering', 'Dylan', 'originals', 'are', 'own', 'tremendous', 'version', ""'ll"", 'Remember', 'unplugged', 'far', 'slower', 'album', 'appeared', 'also', 'one', 'verse', 'Blind', 'Willie', 'McTell', 'third', 'disc', 'Bootleg', 'Series', 'Vol', '1-3', 'Also', 'boxed', 'CD', 'set', 'dazzling', 'number', 'called', 'Angelina', 'instrumental', 'version', 'Angelina', 'end', 'film', 'lyrics', 'are', 'never', 'sung.I', 'eagerly', 'searched', 'CD', 'soundtrack', 'thinking', 'songs', 'would', 'be', ""'re"", 'not', 'critics', 'have', 'found', 'film', 'be', 'pretentious', 'self-conscious', 'found', 'anything', 'overdubbed', 'talking', 'apparently', 'first', 'person', 'Dylan', 'persona', 'Jack', 'Fate', 'may', 'fall', 'category', 'Jeff', 'Bridges', 'monologue', 'would', 'have', 'edited', 'out', 'Jack', 'Fate', 'parts', 'sound', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'Dylan', 'reading', 'autobiography', 'actual', 'character', 'rarely', 'film', ""n't"", 'seem', 'too', 'far', 'removed', 'riverboat', 'gambler', 'Love', 'Theft', 'would', 'have', 'liked', 'T-Bone', 'Burnett', 'have', 'been', 'film', 'course', 'busy', 'Coen', 'Bros.', 'projects', 'producing', 'hope', 're-releasing', 'Proof', 'Night', 'Trap', 'Door', 'who', 'missed', 'Rhino', 'limited', 'edition', 'release.The', 'photography', 'amazing', 'iconography', 'taken', 'cover', 'little', 'heard', 'Dylan', 'album', 'Knocked', 'Out', 'Loaded', 'perhaps', 'helped', 'inspire', 'Dylan', 'one', 'few', 'performers', 'home', 'French', 'Spanish', 'culture', 'regularly', 'New', 'Orleans', 'jazz', 'festivals', 'here', 'home', 'references', 'Hemmingway', 'other', 'expatriates', 'Finally', 'writing', 'film', 'amazing', 'Where', 'are', 'going', 'Jack', 'Fate', 'fellow', 'traveller', 'bus', 'stop', 'way', 'good', 'way', 'way', 'words', 'effect', 'Masked', 'captures', 'Dylan', 'perhaps', 'most', 'natural', 'persona', 'one', 'many', 'can', 'relate', 'wanderer', 'serious', 'business', 'indeed', 'taking', 'too', 'seriously', 'art', 'house', 'need', 'not', 'be', 'arty']",Masked and Anonymous
496845,A328S9RN3U5M68,B00000F2L9,Grady Harp,"[4, 5]","MASKED AND ANONYMOUS is not the typical genre of film that attracts this reviewer, but having taken the time to sit through the piece, think about it, and muse over why it was made in the first place, summons some ideas worth sharing.Bob Dylan is an American Icon, a man whose music has interpreted much of the milieu of the 20th century in America, and the times they are a changing.  Dylan wrote the script for this venture (with director Larry Charles whose credits include Seinfeld, Curb Your Enthusiasm etc) and the film is very much like a Dylan song: there are repeated phrases drawn from the gut-level of language and reaction to events, phrases that don't necessarily make a lot of sense taken out of context, and a lot of band covered vocalism that just seems to add atmosphere for the heck of it.That is the manner in which this film reflects Dadaism and Nihilism and as such it truly is an art film.  The story is meager: corrupt show people try to hold a fundraising concert for the corrupt government that is being overthrown by revolutionaries and counterrevolutionaries and the only Big Star they can hire is the jailed Jack Fate (Bob Dylan) who is less than the desired Hollywood extravaganza desired.  The writing on the signs in the town of unknown origin are in every language and the characters who are in charge of the show and who are the populace of this oddly demented, strife ridden, war zone city are of every ethnic group imaginable.  In other words, this 'political upheaval' place could be in Africa, Latin America, Middle East, Asia, ? the USA? - it is just somewhere (or everywhere!).The film is obviously a work of love as it has the largest cast of fine actors even in the bit parts: Bob Dylan, John Goodman, Jessica Lange, Luke Wilson, Christian Slater, Val Kilmer, Mickey Rourke, Penelope Cruz, Giovanni Ribisi, Ed Harris, Angela Bassett, Cheech Marin, Steve Bauer, Bruce Dern, Michael Paul Chan - and others.  The sets are obviously sets, the scenes seem like they had no rehearsal, the acting is intentionally crude, and the action simply is decor for some renderings of Dylan's songs.  It is looney, weird, funny, puzzling, ridiculous, overlong, and altogether a tribute to the genius of Bob Dylan - and a frightening anti-political statement about where we are right now, right here.Tune in and turn on and adjust your head controls for a wild ride that has a lot to say because it makes you think - and then questions the very process of intellectualizing the whole affair!Grady Harp, November 2004",5,Several Reasons Why This Is A Terrific Movie,1101081600,"11 22, 2004",2004,2539,"['MASKED', 'AND', 'ANONYMOUS', 'not', 'typical', 'genre', 'film', 'reviewer', 'having', 'taken', 'time', 'sit', 'piece', 'think', 'muse', 'why', 'was', 'made', 'first', 'place', 'summons', 'ideas', 'worth', 'sharing.Bob', 'Dylan', 'American', 'Icon', 'man', 'music', 'interpreted', 'much', 'milieu', '20th', 'century', 'America', 'times', 'are', 'changing', 'Dylan', 'wrote', 'script', 'venture', 'director', 'Larry', 'Charles', 'credits', 'include', 'Seinfeld', 'Curb', 'Your', 'Enthusiasm', 'etc', 'film', 'very', 'much', 'Dylan', 'song', 'are', 'repeated', 'phrases', 'drawn', 'gut-level', 'language', 'reaction', 'events', 'phrases', 'do', ""n't"", 'necessarily', 'make', 'lot', 'sense', 'taken', 'context', 'lot', 'band', 'covered', 'vocalism', 'just', 'add', 'atmosphere', 'heck', 'it.That', 'manner', 'film', 'Dadaism', 'Nihilism', 'such', 'art', 'film', 'story', 'meager', 'corrupt', 'show', 'people', 'try', 'hold', 'fundraising', 'concert', 'corrupt', 'government', 'being', 'overthrown', 'revolutionaries', 'counterrevolutionaries', 'only', 'Big', 'Star', 'can', 'hire', 'jailed', 'Jack', 'Fate', 'Bob', 'Dylan', 'who', 'less', 'desired', 'Hollywood', 'extravaganza', 'desired', 'writing', 'signs', 'town', 'unknown', 'origin', 'are', 'language', 'characters', 'who', 'are', 'charge', 'show', 'who', 'are', 'populace', 'oddly', 'demented', 'strife', 'ridden', 'war', 'zone', 'city', 'are', 'ethnic', 'group', 'imaginable', 'other', 'words', ""'political"", 'upheaval', 'place', 'could', 'be', 'Africa', 'Latin', 'America', 'Middle', 'East', 'Asia', 'USA', 'just', 'somewhere', 'everywhere', '.The', 'film', 'obviously', 'work', 'love', 'largest', 'cast', 'fine', 'actors', 'even', 'bit', 'parts', 'Bob', 'Dylan', 'John', 'Goodman', 'Jessica', 'Lange', 'Luke', 'Wilson', 'Christian', 'Slater', 'Val', 'Kilmer', 'Mickey', 'Rourke', 'Penelope', 'Cruz', 'Giovanni', 'Ribisi', 'Ed', 'Harris', 'Angela', 'Bassett', 'Cheech', 'Marin', 'Steve', 'Bauer', 'Bruce', 'Dern', 'Michael', 'Paul', 'Chan', 'others', 'sets', 'are', 'obviously', 'sets', 'scenes', 'seem', 'had', 'rehearsal', 'acting', 'intentionally', 'crude', 'action', 'simply', 'decor', 'renderings', 'Dylan', 'songs', 'looney', 'weird', 'funny', 'puzzling', 'ridiculous', 'overlong', 'altogether', 'tribute', 'genius', 'Bob', 'Dylan', 'frightening', 'anti-political', 'statement', 'where', 'are', 'right', 'now', 'right', 'here.Tune', 'turn', 'adjust', 'head', 'controls', 'wild', 'ride', 'lot', 'say', 'think', 'then', 'questions', 'very', 'process', 'intellectualizing', 'whole', 'affair', 'Grady', 'Harp', 'November', '2004']",Masked and Anonymous

It seems like everybody who is anybody in tinsel town, with an appropriately reverent attitude toward ""Mr. Tambourine Man,"" wanted to be in the movie and act with the maestro. The ""anybodys"" in the cast include: John Goodman, Jessica Lange, Jeff Bridges as a bizarre reporter who grills interview subjects, Pen&eacute;lope Cruz as his supremely neurotic girlfriend with a 333 tattoo and an Incan wardrobe, Luke Wilson in snakeskin, Angela Bassett, Chris Penn, Christian Slater, Mickey Rourke, Ed Harris, Val Kilmer - very funny as a rabid animal activist, Bruce Dern, Cheech Marin, Giovanni Ribisi, and Fred Ward - Dylan groupies all.

The movie is set in an unnamed third world country post disastrous counterrevolution...or, it could be the US turned third world country because of a disastrous counterrevolution. Dylan's song, ""Desolation Row,"" was probably consulted and studied before the set designer went to work.Music impresario Uncle Sweetheart, played by a sleazy John Goodman, decides to host a musical benefit for the children made miserable by the country's upheavals. He and his blowzy producer, (Jessica Lange), are unable to get any of their A-List performers to star. Paul McCartney, Springsteen, Billy Joel all just say ""no."" The only available musician willing to perform is Jack Fate, (played by guess who?), who has to be sprung from jail before he can show up. There is an underlying story about a despicable, dying dictator who looks just like Saddam Hussein, (Richard Sarafian), and could be Jack Fate's father. It really doesn't matter who he is, though, in the general scheme of things. If you like Bob Dylan, you won't mind the laid-back air of confusion surrounding whatever plot there is. Just go with the flow - a very 60s thing to do.Much of the film's dialogue seems to come from Dylan's songs, some in-jokes that older fans, born before the 1960s, will undoubtedly understand, (I sure did), and wry commentary about almost everything. Some of the dialogue is quite funny. What isn't funny, however, are all the obviously aging stars - who share approximate birth dates with me. The aging process leave no one untouched. Mr. Dylan is totally deadpan, as usual. Has anyone ever seen him smile? It is difficult to understand much of what he says - but hey, I'm a Dylan fan, Bigtime! So, while I may feign a bit of disrespect and sarcasm, I was thrilled to see my favorite super-charismatic, anti-hero and musical genius on the big screen. He makes amazing music - still. His back-up is excellent. He performs six songs on camera, four of his own and two standards, ""Diamond Joe"" and ""Dixie."" And his version of ""Dixie"" is fab-uuu-lous!!! (although why he selected ""Dixie"" is beyond me).Director Larry Charles described this movie to the press as, ""Shakespeare done by John Cassavetes"" - a ""post-apocalyptic, sci-fi, film noir, spaghetti western."" I'd have to agree with him. Again, I loved the movie - but I would love anything that featured Bob Dylan.JANA",4,"""A Sci-Fi, Film Noir, Spaghetti Western,"" Surrealistic Film!",1083283200,"04 30, 2004",2004,3372,"['Bob', 'Dylan', 'fans', 'will', 'love', 'surrealistic', 'film', 'starring', 'Bob', 'Dylan', 'co-written', 'Bob', 'Dylan', 'apparently', 'pseudonym', 'Rene', 'Fontaine', 'about', 'Bob', 'Dylan', 'extraordinary', 'supporting', 'cast', 'Hollywood', 'royalty', 'who', 'seem', 'revere', 'Bob', 'Dylan', 'everybody', 'who', 'anybody', 'tinsel', 'town', 'appropriately', 'reverent', 'attitude', 'Mr.', 'Tambourine', 'Man', 'wanted', 'be', 'movie', 'act', 'maestro', 'anybodys', 'cast', 'include', 'John', 'Goodman', 'Jessica', 'Lange', 'Jeff', 'Bridges', 'bizarre', 'reporter', 'who', 'interview', 'subjects', 'Pen', 'eacute', 'Cruz', 'supremely', 'neurotic', 'girlfriend', '333', 'tattoo', 'Incan', 'wardrobe', 'Luke', 'Wilson', 'snakeskin', 'Angela', 'Bassett', 'Chris', 'Penn', 'Christian', 'Slater', 'Mickey', 'Rourke', 'Ed', 'Harris', 'Val', 'Kilmer', 'very', 'funny', 'rabid', 'animal', 'activist', 'Bruce', 'Dern', 'Cheech', 'Marin', 'Giovanni', 'Ribisi', 'Fred', 'Ward', 'Dylan', 'Larry', 'Charles', 'directed', 'Masked', 'Anonymous', 'acclaimed', 'television', 'writer', 'Seinfeld', 'HBO', 'Curb', 'Your', 'Enthusiasm', 'movie', 'set', 'unnamed', 'third', 'world', 'country', 'post', 'disastrous', 'counterrevolution', 'could', 'be', 'US', 'turned', 'third', 'world', 'country', 'disastrous', 'counterrevolution', 'Dylan', 'song', 'Desolation', 'Row', 'was', 'probably', 'consulted', 'studied', 'set', 'designer', 'went', 'work.Music', 'impresario', 'Uncle', 'Sweetheart', 'played', 'sleazy', 'John', 'Goodman', 'host', 'musical', 'benefit', 'children', 'made', 'miserable', 'country', 'upheavals', 'blowzy', 'producer', 'Jessica', 'Lange', 'are', 'unable', 'get', 'A-List', 'performers', 'star', 'Paul', 'McCartney', 'Springsteen', 'Billy', 'Joel', 'just', 'say', 'only', 'available', 'musician', 'willing', 'perform', 'Jack', 'Fate', 'played', 'guess', 'who', 'who', 'be', 'sprung', 'jail', 'can', 'show', 'up', 'underlying', 'story', 'despicable', 'dying', 'dictator', 'who', 'just', 'like', 'Saddam', 'Hussein', 'Richard', 'Sarafian', 'could', 'be', 'Jack', 'Fate', 'father', 'really', ""n't"", 'matter', 'who', 'though', 'general', 'scheme', 'things', 'like', 'Bob', 'Dylan', 'wo', ""n't"", 'mind', 'laid-back', 'air', 'confusion', 'surrounding', 'plot', 'Just', 'go', 'flow', 'very', '60s', 'thing', 'do.Much', 'film', 'dialogue', 'come', 'Dylan', 'songs', 'in-jokes', 'older', 'fans', 'born', '1960s', 'will', 'undoubtedly', 'understand', 'sure', 'did', 'wry', 'commentary', 'almost', 'everything', 'dialogue', 'quite', 'funny', 'What', ""n't"", 'funny', 'however', 'are', 'obviously', 'aging', 'stars', 'who', 'share', 'approximate', 'birth', 'dates', 'aging', 'process', 'leave', 'one', 'untouched', 'Mr.', 'Dylan', 'totally', 'deadpan', 'usual', 'Has', 'anyone', 'ever', 'seen', 'smile', 'difficult', 'understand', 'much', 'what', 'hey', ""'m"", 'Dylan', 'fan', 'Bigtime', 'So', 'may', 'feign', 'bit', 'disrespect', 'sarcasm', 'was', 'thrilled', 'see', 'favorite', 'super-charismatic', 'anti-hero', 'musical', 'genius', 'big', 'screen', 'amazing', 'music', 'still', 'back-up', 'excellent', 'six', 'songs', 'camera', 'four', 'own', 'two', 'standards', 'Diamond', 'Joe', 'Dixie', 'version', 'Dixie', 'fab-uuu-lous', 'why', 'selected', 'Dixie', '.Director', 'Larry', 'Charles', 'described', 'movie', 'press', 'Shakespeare', 'done', 'John', 'Cassavetes', 'post-apocalyptic', 'sci-fi', 'film', 'noir', 'spaghetti', 'western', ""'d"", 'have', 'agree', 'Again', 'loved', 'movie', 'would', 'love', 'anything', 'featured', 'Bob', 'Dylan.JANA']",Masked and Anonymous

On the other hand, do not attempt to find anything redeeming about the film if you aren't at least a casual admirer of Bob Dylan.The plot is simple and cameos abound.  Folk singer Jack Fate (Bob Dylan) is busted out of prison by manager (John Goodman) so he can perform a benefit concert that may re-unite his unnamed civil war-torn home country.  Cameo highlights include Jeff Bridges as an overzealous Lebowski Dude-like reporter, Luke Wilson as a fellow musician, Val Kilmer as a prophet of sorts, and the always enjoyable Cheech Marin.Bob Dylan is a flat, frail actor.  I suspect his stony silence was supposed to belie some inner tortured musician nature, but he just comes off as a cardboard cut-out.  Watching this movie, I was struck by the similarities to Poison lead singer Bret Michaels's vanity film about a felonious bad boy with a heart of gold (Letter from Death Row).  Both movies have fantastic musicians proving that they can't act, their script-writing abilities are absurd, and their music is far superior in the context of an album than as a concept piece for a movie.  Both movies abound with stereotypical characters who serve only to parody themselves.This is not to say there aren't funny moments, or that none of the actors shine.

Next day, it had gone back to the video store. ""You didn't want to watch the rest of that thing, did you?""Well yeah, I did. Not because I was particularly impressed or that it was in any way outstanding, but because my interest was held in spite of all that. ""Masked and Anonymous"" is something you don't often see these days, the kind of let's-turn-on-the-camera-and see-what-happens flick they stopped making around '72, for good reasons. (Anyone who has seen ""Steelyard Blues"" or ""Brewster McCloud"" knows exactly what I mean.) M&A; is not going to revive the genre. It features most of the type's drawbacks--a perfunctory story that basically serves as a framework for various odd, disconnected events. Dismal camerawork, cinematography, and technical aspects done with that ""throw out the rulebook' feel that's always marked this kind of film. (""I mean, Dylan did it  that way back in the '60s, right?"" Yeah, but Dylan replaced it with genius, and that was R&R.;)The acting is almost uniformly awful. The cast evidently took this as being on the order of a John Waters film and proceeded accordingly. M&A; features THE worst Jeff Bridges performance.  Lange spends the time channeling Cruella de Ville. Goodman carries most of the weight with much of his usual charm, but he seems tired at times. Not even the dependable Fred Ward comes out unscathed, managing to screw up a turn as an obnoxious drunk.Exceptions include Basset, as adorable as ever, Luke Wilson, who doesn't have much to do, and Val Kilmer, who excels as a kind of postmodern Jeremiah. But I would have guessed he'd do that.The difference, of course, lies with Dylan. No, he can't act, but that doesn't matter. All he does is walk around looking enigmatic and uttering oracular phrases, but that's Bob Dylan as he's been since 1961, and that's what you came to see. And it works, as it always has, even if he does look like Vincent Price after a rough night in the graveyard. When he's onscreen, your eye is glued to him, and nothing else registers. There are few at any given time who have that kind of presence. The rest of the cast may well have been aware of it, and simply decided not to compete. DeNiro might have been able to keep up, but he'd not in this one. (Bob has a couple good lines too, as in the beginning where somebody reports two eagles killing a rabbit. ""Rabbit must have done something,"" Bob says.)So for the moment, it's a three-and-a-half. But I will catch up with rest of it one of these days.

The story is of Jack Fate and his journey through playing in a benefit concert to help out the victims of the revolution. The revolution is fictitous one that is happening in a fictitous country, but the message is real. The story is addressing the powers of imperialism, the pities of human nature. Throughout the film the audience hears thunder in the background, and in the end a storm erupts. Physically and symbolically. Bob Dylan's performance is somewhat dry at points, but he is merely playing himself. You can not judge him as an actor because he is a singer, a songwriter. The music in the movie was done entirely by him, even the songs not sung by him were written by him and they all have a connecting theme, imperialism. There are many cameos in the film and to the average moviegoer they will seem pointless, but in fact each of these cameos are symbolic representations of human characteristics. If you notice in the credits each person is labled as either ""the soldier"", ""the drunk"", etc. That soldier and that drunk can represent every soldier and drunk in the world.

496859,A3SKGQSU29ZV80,B00000F2L9,Lleu Christopher,"[21, 26]","Many professional critics, accustomed to lavishing praise on the latest Hollywood by-the-numbers spectacle, simply didn't *get* this film at all. It certainly helps to be a Bob Dylan fan, but I think it is intrinsically interesting, thoughtful and original on its own merits. Believe it or not, I picked up this movie at the video store without knowing much about it, and I didn't even realize the central character was Bob Dylan until he sang! (call me the Clueless Critic ). My point is, I had been enjoying the film up to that point, and continued to do so. As in other surrealistic movies (e.g. Fear and Loathing In Las Vegas,  movies by David Lynch or Jim Jarmusch), you have to accept that you aren't going to get a linear plot and open yourself to the experience. I found the satirical manner in which a war and revolution-stricken Third World nation was portrayed darkly hilarious. It is a hellish montage of every poor country on earth. The downtrodden people are, improbably, of all different races and religions. Dylan himself (who was criticized for his lack of acting) plays a stone-faced version of himself named Jack Fate. He has been hired to play a benefit for this unnamed country by a corrupt promoter (John Goodman). It would be almost pointless to try to describe the plot any further. What this film is really about is the bizarre imagery, dialogue and atmosphere (and, of course, music). Characters are constantly having conversations where truisms and conventional thinking are twisted into humorously wise Zenlike nonsense.  Although Dylan apparently did not write or direct this film, he seemingly could have. Both promoters and reporters (in the guise of a pestering, gun-toting one played by Jeff Bridges) are portrayed as slimy predators. Although it is true that Dylan doesn't really act in this film, his total lack of expression adds something to the surreal effect.

496862,A2GBBZWJT4L3Y4,B00000F2L9,Michael Osborn,"[0, 0]","Storytelling is elementary.  You introduce characters and their parts in the story.  Trite and overdone plot elements cried out for the need to approach these story elements from new directions and many of the greatest directors have met that challenge by creating new concepts to the art.  But in the end the audience has to get it somehow, even if, as in the case of some of the more bizarre directors' visions, the point is that there is no point.My least favorite type of film director is the one who doesn't have the skills to back up his convictions.  Larry Charles wants to be innovative and different but at the same time he wants this film to look professional.  Hollywood has great stars who can act, so Mr. Charles got great stars who can act.  Hollywood cannot have a musical performance in a film without impatiently interrupting it by cutting to main characters and their seemingly crucial incessant dialogue.  So Mr. Charles cannot allow his character, Jack Fate (Dylan) to complete a performance without jumping right in to more of his disconnected plot.In all of the arts, including film making, the weakest work is the one that cannot stand on its own and needs the `big explanation' to justify its survival as art.  This is sloppy art because it makes the audience work for their entertainment which is antithetical and compromising to the viewer.  `Masked and Anonymous' is such a work.  Many of the characters names and purposes are hidden either in the film somewhere or in the DVD chapter titles.  Some complain that they don't understand what was going on in the movie but this is because they didn't know that they have to dig a little for the plot.For example, at one point the movie abruptly introduces a character played by Jeff Bridges (if you look at the DVD chapter title you will discover his name is Tom Friend).  He comes into an office but you don't know of what type and only through the dialogue with his boss do you discover it is a newspaper office.  In most movies you would know this immediately.Tom Friend:  So, what's this all about?  I got my awards. I got my scars. I got nothing to prove to you.Newspaper Editor:  The rebels are broadcasting a benefit concert for medical relief.  But the government controls the network.  I just want to make sure that its not a P.R. thing, that they're not trying to make themselves look compassionate, or that its not some kind of a set-up or a nefarious ploy to weed out the rebels.  But I will tell you this, there is a story there.  ...There's something else.  There's only one performer, Jack Fate!

""movie watcher""","[11, 12]","It would be almost cliche' at this point to liken ""Masked and Anonymous"" to one of Dylan's epic songs, since every other reviewer who has seen it has done so. But they're right, and if you're a Dylan fan, you'll appreciate the film so much more for just that reason.""Masked and Anonymous"" encompasses just about every theme we've heard Dylan deal with in his music for the past forty years - religion, corruption, oppression, injustice, love and, finally, redemption.  Dylan, through the character of Jack Fate, portrays an image of himself that is familiar from his songs - at times in the film, he's the Jokerman, other times the Jack of Hearts.  These are, of course, my own interpretations - you'll certainly have your own once you've seen this film as it's wide open to a million different interpretations.The performances in this picture should not be overlooked either. The lead performances as well as cameos from a dozen or so A-list Hollywood actors are top-notch.  Among these, Jeff Bridges as Tom Friendly, the cynical journalist, stands out as exceptional - oscar-worthy in my humble opinion - but since when does the academy give awards to the films and actors that really deserve to win??But I digress ... Dylan is obviously the weakest actor in the film, but more than makes up for it with his powerful presence.  In certain instances, as he recites lines like, ""I don't pay any attention to my dreams"" or ""You've got to be born on my side, Sweetheart,"" he even upstages his very talented co-stars.And, of course, the music.  The film is packed with interpretations of Dylan's own songs, including foreign language translations of ""Like a Rolling Stone"" and ""If You See Her, Say Hello"".  I was personally thrilled to hear ""Blind Willie McTell"" in the soundtrack, though it didn't particularly seem to fit the scene.

He's been producing work for over 40 years, and much of it has imbedded itself in American, if not world culture.  First and foremost, he's a brilliant lyricist and master of artistic revelation, he's also a composer of sorts, but his music has never been all that complex.  When he received a songwriting award he mentioned that he didn't read music, and didn't plan to learn.  He's certainly accomplished in folk, blues, gospel, and in the way those forms melt into rock and roll; and he's even got some cool jazz licks in his repertoire, but no one will ever mistake him for a ""serious composer"" though his heart, hand, ear, and mind are connected and he has the tools and collaborators he needs to get his musical vision out to the public.  He's also written prose, though not that well; poetry, but outside his gift for song lyrics his poetry isn't very good; and screenplays, but no awards will be heading his way in that category; which brings us to, ""Masked & Anonymous.""I think Dylan has written a script that's a lot more coherent than some reviewers believe but it's not tight enough to be compelling, and it's not directed with the rhythm or consistency needed to lift it beyond a series of scenes, or to make it as interesting as any of Dylan's more surreal lyrics.  I actually think the failure of ""Masked & Anonymous,"" has more to do with direction than writing, and though I don't know how much of a hand Dylan had in that all indications are he and Larry Charles were close collaborators.  For a Bob Dylan work that's probably as it should be, but for a script written by Dylan and directed by Charles the director should have had a firmer hand. Someone has written that the performances were as cartoonish as they needed to be, but they weren't cartoonish, they were just bad.  Bad as in ""undirected.""

Two concert promoters (John Goodman and Jessica Lange) bite their nails over Fate's appearance, Luke Wilson is the roadie to end all roadies, while a rock journalist (Jeff Bridges) is assigned to the story, a hitman (Mickey Rourke) intends to party poop, and so on and so on.The movie unfurls like a Dylan song, with roundabouts and twistaroos and ""ironies"" such as a freedom fighter switching sides to fight his own kind because they were too dogmatic. This character is played by Giovanni Ribisi, who eventually gets so ticked off during his monologue - the entire movie is monologues, most of which are given while Dylan sits silently next to a B-list cameo actor - that he jumps off a bus and deliberately gets shot. Uh huh. Like most Dylan songs, ""Masked and Anonymous"" is rich with everything but discipline - if it ekes every so slightly toward Making A Definitive Point it recedes, Dylan-style, back into a squint and shrug - and listening to a happy accident is great deal more fun than watching it.If The Truth is that everybody's hands are dirty, fine - use that as a line a dialogue and make the other 90 minutes about something else entirely.

Or at least I am after watching Masked and Anonymous. From Shakespeare to Tennessee Williams to Wes Anderson, artists writing for visual adaptation must all posses their own sense of ""song writing."" Bob Dylan is a masterful musician who speaks with such soul, depth, and rhythm that he has become a legend. Surrounded with mystery, the man has an almost religious following (don't believe me? Just take a look at all the big name actors that lined up just to work with him in this one). Masked and Anonymous captures the soul of Dylan with its cryptic poeticism, and distinct political messages. Add to the mix the real Dylan and six original songs debuted in the film, and you have created a cinematic world like none you have seen before.Most critics bashed the movie, calling it brainless and empty - a sort of masturbation act for Dylan and the actors who blindly signed up to work in a ""Dylan Movie."" I don't care. Masked and Anonymous had me from its opening frames.

This movie understands that magic through and through (the two other films this year that really created this alternate reality for me as a viewer were Finding Nemo and Down With Love).

And IF they DID, anyone with half-a-brain would run away from them as fast as possible!  The acting ranges from insanely OVER-THE-TOP to lame to amputated - many good-to-great actors say their lines as if each was so gosh-darn PROFOUND or if this were high school and ""M&A"" was their chance to ""shine"" in a 10th grade class play.  The plot/story is heavy-handed satire on, well, stardom and America -- if someone under the age of 16 wrote the script, I'd say it was OK.  As for Dylan's ""acting"" as ""Jack Fate"" (I guess ""Irving Destiny"" was already taken), I've seen CORPSES move more naturally.  The soundtrack is nice, however.

And it's awful pretty much for all the reasons that it's being praised here. Everything everybody says is the movie is supposed to be PROFOUND.Nobody can just say, &quot;Hey, Jack, how you doin'?&quot; &quot;Fine. You?&quot; No, the answer to that question would be a 30-second philosophical rant that sounds like Dylan pulled it out of a file cabinet called &quot;profound statements I haven't used yet,&quot; and put it in the script just to get rid of it.What's really sad is that this all-star cast is here simply to work with Bob Dylan. It's like if JESUS ever made a movie.

496876,ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T,B00000F2L9,Tsuyoshi,"[4, 4]","Yes, I admit sometimes musicians make good movies. The Beatles did in `A Hard Days Night' back in the 60s, and I like `Help!' as well. But it is also true that charismatic as they are, they also made mistakes in, say, `Magical Mystery Tour.' And Paul McCartney did another again in `Give My Regards to Broad Street'But the music is always great, even though the film lacks the brilliance of the music. The same thing can be said about `Masked and Anonymous' in which Bob Dylan appears as `Jack Fate,' a musician who is asked to do a benefit concert in the disordered country, held by an unscrupulous promoter John Goodman. Recently released from the prison, Jack joins in the band and plays songs before us ... before the revolution interrupts.But before that concert, Jack meets many people - his friend Luke Wilson, rock journalist Jeff Bridges, his love Penelope Cruz, soldier in a bus Giovanni Ribisi, Editor Bruce Dern, Crew # 1 Christian Slater, Crew #2 Chris Penn, Animal Wrangler Val Kilmer, and Oscar winner Jessica Lange. Plus, Cheech Marin, Steven Bauer, Mickey Rourke, Richard Sarafian, Susan Tyrrell, Tracy Walter, Fred Ward, Robert Wisdom and unrecognizable Ed Harris. All of them must have gathered here because of one person Bob Dylan. And Dylan's status in the music history well-deserves it.But the film itself (written by Dylan and director Larry Charles under assumed names) need more polishing, or at least a point to make. I don't complain if Dylan cannot act - after all he is playing himself. But if you make a film with this cast, whose job here is to act, you need to make it coherent. One example would do. In the film, Dylan's character Jack Fate is often regarded as `nobody' - a has-been who can no longer draw audience as John Goodman repeatedly insists. But we know the truths. We know Dylan is admired by the musicians all over the world (and that's why Goodman is here). And the live sections of the film prove that he is as cool as ever as musician, if not as actor. We enjoy his singing while the characters do not seem impressed. Real professionals like Goodman, Bridges, and Lange do their best to cover the gaps with strong acting, but they are too big to be ignored.I understand the enthusiastic response from Dylan's fans. For all the undeniable energy in the live performance sections (which are mercilessly cut by editing), however, the film is incomprehensive throughout. It's a chaos, and this chaos has no energy that chaotic things are often endowed with. The humor is too feeble (including the references to music history, like the promoter asking Jack to sing a Beatle song), but the most misguided part is its too philosophical speeches that the characters make. Dylan's enigmatic lyrics work in his songs, but not in dialogues or monologues of a film. `Masked and Anonymous' is a curio at best, which is accompanied by the great soundtrack.",2,"The Film is Chaos, Still the Music is Wonderful",1134345600,"12 12, 2005",2005,2891,"['Yes', 'admit', 'sometimes', 'musicians', 'make', 'good', 'movies', 'Beatles', 'did', 'Hard', 'Days', 'Night', 'back', '60s', 'like', 'Help', 'as', 'well', 'also', 'true', 'that', 'charismatic', 'are', 'also', 'made', 'mistakes', 'say', 'Magical', 'Mystery', 'Tour', 'Paul', 'McCartney', 'did', 'again', 'Give', 'Regards', 'Broad', ""Street'But"", 'music', 'always', 'great', 'even', 'film', 'brilliance', 'music', 'same', 'thing', 'can', 'be', 'said', 'Masked', 'Anonymous', 'Bob', 'Dylan', 'Jack', 'Fate', 'musician', 'who', 'asked', 'do', 'benefit', 'concert', 'disordered', 'country', 'held', 'unscrupulous', 'promoter', 'John', 'Goodman', 'Recently', 'released', 'prison', 'Jack', 'band', 'plays', 'songs', 'revolution', 'interrupts.But', 'concert', 'Jack', 'many', 'people', 'friend', 'Luke', 'Wilson', 'rock', 'journalist', 'Jeff', 'Bridges', 'love', 'Penelope', 'Cruz', 'soldier', 'bus', 'Giovanni', 'Ribisi', 'Editor', 'Bruce', 'Dern', 'Crew', '1', 'Christian', 'Slater', 'Crew', '2', 'Chris', 'Penn', 'Animal', 'Wrangler', 'Val', 'Kilmer', 'Oscar', 'winner', 'Jessica', 'Lange', 'Cheech', 'Marin', 'Steven', 'Bauer', 'Mickey', 'Rourke', 'Richard', 'Sarafian', 'Susan', 'Tyrrell', 'Tracy', 'Walter', 'Fred', 'Ward', 'Robert', 'Wisdom', 'unrecognizable', 'Ed', 'Harris', 'must', 'have', 'gathered', 'here', 'one', 'person', 'Bob', 'Dylan', 'Dylan', 'status', 'music', 'history', 'well-deserves', 'it.But', 'film', 'written', 'Dylan', 'director', 'Larry', 'Charles', 'assumed', 'names', 'need', 'more', 'polishing', 'least', 'point', 'make', 'do', ""n't"", 'complain', 'Dylan', 'can', 'not', 'act', 'playing', 'make', 'film', 'cast', 'job', 'here', 'act', 'need', 'make', 'coherent', 'One', 'example', 'would', 'do', 'film', 'Dylan', 'character', 'Jack', 'Fate', 'often', 'regarded', 'nobody', 'has-been', 'who', 'can', 'no', 'longer', 'draw', 'audience', 'John', 'Goodman', 'repeatedly', 'know', 'truths', 'know', 'Dylan', 'admired', 'musicians', 'world', 'why', 'Goodman', 'here', 'live', 'sections', 'film', 'prove', 'as', 'cool', 'as', 'ever', 'musician', 'not', 'actor', 'enjoy', 'singing', 'characters', 'do', 'not', 'seem', 'impressed', 'Real', 'professionals', 'Goodman', 'Bridges', 'Lange', 'do', 'best', 'cover', 'gaps', 'strong', 'acting', 'are', 'too', 'big', 'be', 'ignored.I', 'enthusiastic', 'response', 'Dylan', 'fans', 'undeniable', 'energy', 'live', 'performance', 'sections', 'are', 'mercilessly', 'cut', 'editing', 'however', 'film', 'incomprehensive', 'chaos', 'chaos', 'energy', 'chaotic', 'things', 'are', 'often', 'endowed', 'humor', 'too', 'feeble', 'including', 'references', 'music', 'history', 'promoter', 'asking', 'Jack', 'sing', 'Beatle', 'song', 'most', 'misguided', 'part', 'too', 'philosophical', 'speeches', 'characters', 'make', 'Dylan', 'enigmatic', 'lyrics', 'work', 'songs', 'not', 'dialogues', 'monologues', 'film', 'Masked', 'Anonymous', 'curio', 'best', 'accompanied', 'great', 'soundtrack']",Masked and Anonymous
496877,A1JNKGC3C6OVGQ,B00000F2L9,"Ujjwal Dey ""2write""","[1, 1]","Masked and Anonymous (2003)Writers: Bob Dylan (written by) &Larry Charles (written by)I did not know I had this movie. Sorting through old DVDs I found 5 movies starring Penelope Cruz. Then I looked more closely at the cover art - there he was - the living legend - Bob Dylan starring in a movie of his own (directed by Seinfeld director).That was enough reason for anyone to watch this movie. Dylan starring as Jack Fate - an old forgotten heroic musician lost to the modern era. He is brought back on stage by a hustling friend (Goodman) who is organising a charity where none of the big stars want to play. Damn all LiveAids and the rest. This is in a country unknown with a war not understood at an unspecified year.Now the fabulous star cast that bring more vigour to the solid presence of Dylan himself:Bob Dylan ... Jack FateJeff Bridges ... Tom FriendPen&eacute;lope Cruz ... Pagan LaceJohn Goodman ... Uncle SweetheartJessica Lange ... Nina VeronicaLuke Wilson ... Bobby CupidAngela Bassett ... MistressSteven Bauer ... EdgarMichael Paul Chan ... GuardBruce Dern ... EditorEd Harris ... Oscar VogelVal Kilmer ... Animal WranglerCheech Marin ... ProsperoChris Penn ... Crew Guy #2Giovanni Ribisi ... SoldierThey all are perfect in their characters.I didn't recognise Mickey Rourke as the President's son and heir. But I recognised his voice of course - am a fan of that guy or rather the crazy people he plays in his movies.So you think it is too heavily loaded with superstars to make it work?Well the question you need to ask is :Do you love every single Bob Dylan song he has ever written?Affirmative!The appeal of the movie is to people to whom his songs speak to. He sings about You, about Everyone. The movie has the same USP. And there are Dylan songs galore here even before they were released in Album format.When the movie started with the legend's songs being covered by pop/hiphop style versions as background music I must say I was outraged. But these are good cover versions. And then of course Jack Fate (Dylan) is recruited to do the charity gig and he sings.........Live Dylan and there are other beauties. Jessica as the stressed out media exec and Penelope as Jeff Bridges' Jesus fearing lady.Incredible movie magic as Dylan kicks Jeff Bridges' a$$ to protect the hustler friend. Dylan floors him easily and the climax makes you ponder the futility of all Life everywhere.There are incredible monologues in this movie. The one by Val Kilmer is an acting lesson and work of genius.Then those by Dylan and then him reminiscing the horrible past and dead present.Then there is that weird radio Jessica listens to which gives out News about discovering things at the Earth's crust and how hollow Earth's soul really is.Yes Philosophy or Abstract Art - whatever you call it - its mesmerising and captivating.Visit Wikipedia page to check out the fab music in this treasure of a movie:[...] mousAt IMDB:[...]",5,The Heroic Bob Dylan now also as a Movie Hero,1214092800,"06 22, 2008",2008,2929,"['Masked', 'Anonymous', '2003', 'Writers', 'Bob', 'Dylan', 'written', 'Larry', 'Charles', 'written', 'did', 'not', 'know', 'had', 'movie', 'Sorting', 'old', 'DVDs', 'found', '5', 'movies', 'starring', 'Penelope', 'Cruz', 'Then', 'looked', 'more', 'closely', 'cover', 'art', 'was', 'living', 'legend', 'Bob', 'Dylan', 'starring', 'movie', 'own', 'directed', 'Seinfeld', 'director', 'was', 'enough', 'reason', 'anyone', 'watch', 'movie', 'Dylan', 'starring', 'Jack', 'Fate', 'old', 'forgotten', 'heroic', 'musician', 'lost', 'modern', 'era', 'brought', 'back', 'stage', 'hustling', 'friend', 'Goodman', 'who', 'organising', 'charity', 'where', 'none', 'big', 'stars', 'want', 'play', 'Damn', 'LiveAids', 'rest', 'country', 'unknown', 'war', 'not', 'understood', 'unspecified', 'year.Now', 'fabulous', 'star', 'cast', 'bring', 'more', 'vigour', 'solid', 'presence', 'Dylan', 'Bob', 'Dylan', 'Jack', 'FateJeff', 'Bridges', 'Tom', 'FriendPen', 'eacute', 'Cruz', 'Pagan', 'LaceJohn', 'Goodman', 'Uncle', 'SweetheartJessica', 'Lange', 'Nina', 'VeronicaLuke', 'Wilson', 'Bobby', 'CupidAngela', 'Bassett', 'MistressSteven', 'Bauer', 'EdgarMichael', 'Paul', 'Chan', 'GuardBruce', 'Dern', 'EditorEd', 'Harris', 'Oscar', 'VogelVal', 'Kilmer', 'Animal', 'WranglerCheech', 'Marin', 'ProsperoChris', 'Penn', 'Crew', 'Guy', '2Giovanni', 'Ribisi', 'SoldierThey', 'are', 'perfect', 'characters.I', 'did', ""n't"", 'recognise', 'Mickey', 'Rourke', 'President', 'son', 'heir', 'recognised', 'voice', 'course', 'am', 'fan', 'guy', 'rather', 'crazy', 'people', 'movies.So', 'think', 'too', 'heavily', 'loaded', 'superstars', 'make', 'work', 'Well', 'question', 'need', 'ask', 'Do', 'love', 'single', 'Bob', 'Dylan', 'song', 'ever', 'written', 'Affirmative', 'appeal', 'movie', 'people', 'whom', 'songs', 'speak', 'Everyone', 'movie', 'same', 'USP', 'are', 'Dylan', 'songs', 'galore', 'here', 'even', 'were', 'released', 'Album', 'format.When', 'movie', 'started', 'legend', 'songs', 'being', 'covered', 'pop/hiphop', 'style', 'versions', 'background', 'music', 'must', 'say', 'was', 'outraged', 'are', 'good', 'cover', 'versions', 'then', 'course', 'Jack', 'Fate', 'Dylan', 'recruited', 'do', 'charity', 'gig', 'Live', 'Dylan', 'are', 'other', 'beauties', 'Jessica', 'stressed', 'out', 'media', 'exec', 'Penelope', 'Jeff', 'Bridges', 'Jesus', 'fearing', 'lady.Incredible', 'movie', 'magic', 'Dylan', 'Jeff', 'Bridges', 'protect', 'hustler', 'friend', 'Dylan', 'easily', 'climax', 'ponder', 'futility', 'Life', 'are', 'incredible', 'monologues', 'movie', 'one', 'Val', 'Kilmer', 'acting', 'lesson', 'work', 'genius.Then', 'Dylan', 'then', 'reminiscing', 'horrible', 'past', 'dead', 'present.Then', 'weird', 'radio', 'Jessica', 'out', 'News', 'discovering', 'things', 'Earth', 'crust', 'how', 'hollow', 'Earth', 'soul', 'really', 'is.Yes', 'Philosophy', 'Abstract', 'Art', 'call', 'mesmerising', 'captivating.Visit', 'Wikipedia', 'page', 'check', 'out', 'fab', 'music', 'treasure', 'movie', '[', ']', 'mousAt', 'IMDB', '[', ']']",Masked and Anonymous
