Both the story and the artwork are hauntingly beautiful, lovingly tender and inspiring, but are also emotionally moving and heartbreaking.Perhaps the saddest and most disturbingly realistic aspect of this film is the fact that there are no real ""Bad Guys"" we can conveniently point an accusing finger at: Everyone, to some greater or lesser degree, is culpable just as much as they are simultaneously victims of their unfortunate circumstances, and nearly everyone is guilty of making selfish and irrational decisions in the heat of emotions which tend to fare badly for themselves and/or others around them and/or those in their charge.This entire movie (based in part on a true life story) is totally transfixing, making the viewer see all of that is sweet and wonderful even as it drags the viewer along the path from one sad tragedy to another.My only complaint (apart from the DVD not having a menu option for Japanese Language 'Ending Credits') is that I personally felt that at least some time should have been spent following Seita's character after the death of his sister Setsuko, to give us a little insight as to some of the situations he had to face and endure which led up to his eventual and unfortunate end -- (I'd be interested in knowing if I may be alone in this opinion).Anyway, ""Hotaru no Haka"" is indeed a very rare and precious gem among anime features -- and one where a healthy supply of facial tissue is absolutely manditory and should be kept very close at hand whenever planning on watching this movie.* * *",5,"""Why Do Fireflies Have To Die So Soon?""",1022976000,"06 2, 2002",2002,1799,"['Japanese', 'musical', 'style', 'Enka', 'were', 'anime', 'feature', 'film', 'would', 'definitely', 'be', 'school', 'boy', 'orphaned', 'result', 'war', 'time', 'air', 'raids', 'country', 'battles', 'odds', 'order', 'care', 'comfort', 'sick', 'dying', 'little', 'sister', 'story', 'artwork', 'are', 'hauntingly', 'beautiful', 'lovingly', 'tender', 'inspiring', 'are', 'also', 'emotionally', 'moving', 'saddest', 'most', 'disturbingly', 'realistic', 'aspect', 'film', 'fact', 'are', 'real', 'Bad', 'Guys', 'can', 'conveniently', 'point', 'accusing', 'finger', 'Everyone', 'greater', 'lesser', 'degree', 'culpable', 'just', 'as', 'much', 'are', 'simultaneously', 'victims', 'unfortunate', 'circumstances', 'nearly', 'everyone', 'guilty', 'making', 'selfish', 'irrational', 'decisions', 'heat', 'emotions', 'tend', 'fare', 'badly', 'and/or', 'others', 'and/or', 'charge.This', 'entire', 'movie', 'based', 'part', 'true', 'life', 'story', 'totally', 'transfixing', 'making', 'viewer', 'see', 'sweet', 'wonderful', 'even', 'viewer', 'path', 'one', 'sad', 'tragedy', 'another.My', 'only', 'complaint', 'apart', 'DVD', 'not', 'having', 'menu', 'option', 'Japanese', 'Language', ""'Ending"", 'Credits', 'personally', 'felt', 'least', 'time', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'spent', 'following', 'Seita', 'character', 'death', 'sister', 'Setsuko', 'give', 'little', 'insight', 'situations', 'had', 'face', 'endure', 'led', 'up', 'eventual', 'unfortunate', 'end', ""'d"", 'be', 'interested', 'knowing', 'may', 'be', 'alone', 'opinion', '.Anyway', 'Hotaru', 'Haka', 'indeed', 'very', 'rare', 'precious', 'gem', 'anime', 'features', 'one', 'where', 'healthy', 'supply', 'facial', 'tissue', 'absolutely', 'manditory', 'should', 'be', 'kept', 'very', 'close', 'hand', 'whenever', 'planning', 'watching', 'movie', '*', '*']",N/A

Little miracles that try to survive in the cold, forbidding world, and then die silently, with no one noticing. Perhaps the most touching scene in the entire film involves Seita, an orphaned Japanese boy, filling a candy tin with water and offer his four-year-old sister Setsuko the sweetened liquid. She smiles and exclaims: &quot;It's all flavors! Grape, orange, apple, strawberry, mint!&quot; She drinks half and offers him the rest, but he declines. Tears of hunger stand in his eyes, but despite himself he smiles.This is not American &quot;feel-good&quot; animation. The backdrop of Tokyo during the American air raids is a savage, cruel, even inhuman world, and yet Seita and Tetsuko carry on the illusion of happiness right to the bitter, irreversible end. Their mother is caught in the blaze of a firebomb, their aunt spites them when they outlive their usefulness, and turns them away when Seita's stash of food is gone. They are forced to live in an abandoned bomb shelter, trading their possessions for rice, and when those are gone, foraging for any food there is to find. And yet when at night the fireflies rise in warm, glowing clouds, they smile.Grave of the Fireflies left me in a foul, rotten mood, and if you have any measure of humanity in you, it will do that to you too.

183158,ANCOMAI0I7LVG,156219464X,Andrew Ellington,"[8, 8]","So this review feels appropriate beings that just yesterday I added a new friend (I'm talking about you J.D.) who has actually been a friend of mine for a while and who, oddly enough, is the reason I saw this movie in the first place.  If you had asked me a year ago if I ever thought I'd consider an animated film that best of anything I probably would have laughed.  I was under the narrow-minded impression that animated films were nothing more than cartoons and really served no purpose but to entertain your children and, if you were lucky, the parent while they were forced to endure something `less' than a film.I was such an idiot.Thankfully, in a rather rough and condescending manner, my friend told me that and since then I've opened my eyes to the world of the animated film (not the cartoon).  I saw `Hotaru no Haka' a few months ago and I still cannot shake the experience.  Beings that I've been recently revisiting the year that was 1988 for my personal awards I forced myself to watch this film again, last night, and it further cemented to me that this is not just the greatest animated film of all time, but it is one of the best `films' regardless of genre or classification.I'll get to the `forced' part in a second.So, Isao Takahata's tragic film centers around young Seita and his sister Setsuko.  Practically left as orphans in war torn Japan, Seita quickly learns that he has to do everything he can to preserve his life and the life of his young sister.  After their mother is killed in a bombing they move in with their Aunt, who quickly makes known that she finds these two new mouths nothing more than a burden.  Seita then decides to take his sister and move to a small abandoned shelter, but when their resources run out (and they do very quickly) he realizes that there is not much he or anyone else can do to stop the inevitable from happening.Yes, I `forced' myself to watch this a second time.If `The Lion King' or `Bambi' makes you tear up then this film is going to make you weep.  I think having children or being close to children is also going to factor in here, and maybe that's why this film is so hard for me to get through (I'm tearing up just writing this review), but children or no children there is no denying that `Hotaru no Haka' is as tragic and haunting as they come.  There are no sing-along songs here; no slapstick humor of cute fuzzy animals to serve as buffers for the `hard' stuff.  This film is as realistic and heartbreaking as they come, so don't be fooled by its `animated' shell.  The brutal honesty that comes in every frame can be very hard to stomach at times.  This film is so honest that even the scenes depicting the two siblings frolicking about are laced with an obvious sadness because we know that happy endings are not coming here.This film turns me into mush.For anyone who needs some convincing that animated films are just as powerful as live action ones, I strongly recommend you see this movie.  I am forever grateful to J.D. for opening this avenue of cinema to me, and I only hope that I can open this up to you.  You just might want to watch this early enough in the day so that you can watch someone a little more light hearted before bed.And give your kids an extra long hug goodnight.",5,A film that truly breaks down barriers and opens eyes...,1247529600,"07 14, 2009",2009,3269,"['So', 'review', 'appropriate', 'beings', 'just', 'yesterday', 'added', 'new', 'friend', ""'m"", 'talking', 'J.D', 'who', 'actually', 'been', 'friend', 'mine', 'while', 'who', 'oddly', 'enough', 'reason', 'saw', 'movie', 'first', 'place', 'had', 'asked', 'year', 'ever', 'thought', ""'d"", 'consider', 'animated', 'film', 'best', 'anything', 'probably', 'would', 'have', 'laughed', 'was', 'narrow-minded', 'impression', 'animated', 'films', 'were', 'nothing', 'more', 'cartoons', 'really', 'served', 'purpose', 'entertain', 'children', 'were', 'lucky', 'parent', 'were', 'forced', 'endure', 'something', 'less', 'film.I', 'was', 'such', 'idiot.Thankfully', 'rather', 'rough', 'condescending', 'manner', 'friend', 'told', 'then', ""'ve"", 'opened', 'eyes', 'world', 'animated', 'film', 'not', 'cartoon', 'saw', 'Hotaru', 'Haka', 'few', 'months', 'still', 'can', 'not', 'shake', 'experience', 'Beings', ""'ve"", 'been', 'recently', 'revisiting', 'year', 'was', '1988', 'personal', 'awards', 'forced', 'watch', 'film', 'again', 'last', 'night', 'further', 'cemented', 'not', 'just', 'greatest', 'animated', 'film', 'time', 'one', 'best', 'films', 'regardless', 'genre', 'classification.I', ""'ll"", 'get', 'forced', 'part', 'second.So', 'Isao', 'Takahata', 'tragic', 'film', 'centers', 'young', 'Seita', 'sister', 'Setsuko', 'Practically', 'left', 'orphans', 'war', 'Japan', 'Seita', 'quickly', 'do', 'everything', 'can', 'preserve', 'life', 'life', 'young', 'sister', 'mother', 'killed', 'bombing', 'move', 'Aunt', 'who', 'quickly', 'known', 'two', 'new', 'mouths', 'nothing', 'more', 'burden', 'Seita', 'then', 'take', 'sister', 'move', 'small', 'abandoned', 'shelter', 'when', 'resources', 'run', 'out', 'do', 'very', 'quickly', 'not', 'much', 'anyone', 'else', 'can', 'do', 'stop', 'inevitable', 'happening.Yes', 'forced', 'watch', 'second', 'time.If', 'Lion', 'King', 'Bambi', 'tear', 'up', 'then', 'film', 'going', 'make', 'weep', 'think', 'having', 'children', 'being', 'close', 'children', 'also', 'going', 'factor', 'here', 'maybe', 'why', 'film', 'so', 'hard', 'get', ""'m"", 'tearing', 'up', 'just', 'writing', 'review', 'children', 'children', 'denying', 'Hotaru', 'Haka', 'tragic', 'haunting', 'come', 'are', 'sing-along', 'songs', 'here', 'slapstick', 'humor', 'cute', 'fuzzy', 'animals', 'serve', 'buffers', 'hard', 'stuff', 'film', 'realistic', 'heartbreaking', 'come', 'so', 'do', ""n't"", 'be', 'fooled', 'animated', 'shell', 'brutal', 'honesty', 'frame', 'can', 'be', 'very', 'hard', 'stomach', 'times', 'film', 'so', 'honest', 'even', 'scenes', 'depicting', 'two', 'siblings', 'frolicking', 'about', 'are', 'laced', 'obvious', 'sadness', 'know', 'happy', 'endings', 'are', 'not', 'coming', 'here.This', 'film', 'mush.For', 'anyone', 'who', 'convincing', 'animated', 'films', 'are', 'just', 'as', 'powerful', 'live', 'action', 'ones', 'strongly', 'recommend', 'see', 'movie', 'am', 'forever', 'grateful', 'J.D', 'opening', 'avenue', 'cinema', 'only', 'hope', 'can', 'open', 'up', 'just', 'might', 'want', 'watch', 'early', 'enough', 'day', 'can', 'watch', 'someone', 'little', 'more', 'light', 'hearted', 'bed.And', 'give', 'kids', 'extra', 'long', 'hug', 'goodnight']",N/A

Never befor have I seen such a powerful and Emotional film! Historical Acurate this tale is almost  reminisent of a Charles Dickens novel. Set in 1945 we see the stroy through  eyes of the main character a young boy whom must watch over his young  sister after there moter passes away in a bombing raid. From this point on  we see the joys, sorrows, charity, selfishness and pride this young boy  expirences. This is a must see fil for any one who likes a historical  drama. If you enjoyed &quot;Life is Beautiful&quot; then you will love this  film even more. Nothing can keep you from crying in this film. I also  admired the perception of war the director shows us. Not from the standard  view of a soldier suffering and dying but instead innocent people whom have  no choice or power to change the events around them.

It's a rather emotional movie, and it's often called one of the best anti-war movies ever. I don't buy that this movie is at all anti-war. It's much more of a personal experience than anything. This is a story about the human spirit. The film never seems to point fingers or lay blame.First off, this is indeed an extremely good movie. The story is great and the characters are very likable. The Japanese voices are spot on, even the girl. All the parts are well written, and very believable. Nothing seems stretched to the absurd.The art is simply beautiful. Fans of movies such as Kiki's Delivery Service or Mononoke will notice things feel very familiar, due to being these all being from the same studio. The colors range from dark and sad to bright and cheery, sometimes fitting with the mood and other times as a stark contrast to the reality around them.At any rate, it's a really good story and one that's hard to forget. It's well told, it's memorable, it's likable, and it's at times quite sad.

Well, throw all those ideas out, because ""Grave of the Fireflies"" is nothing like that. In fact, it's as close to a ""live action"" movie as you can get in animation. So why is it animated in the first place? Because animation is the only way this movie could portray its message. And guess what? It does it so exceptionally well that you'll be changed after watching this movie.The plot of this movie deals with teenager Seita and his little sister Setsuko as they struggle to survive in Japan during World War II. Their mother had died because of a bomb raid, so they live with their aunt. Trouble is, she doesn't think much about them because they're more of a burden in these hard times of war. So they both go out to live on their own, but are soon plagued by problems such as lack of money and food. Setsuko eventually dies of malnutrition and Seita later dies in a train station.At the very beginning of the film, you'll see just deep this film is. The very first scene shows Seita dying, and the rest of the film deals with how his life spiraled downward towards his eventual death. There is some extreme emotion-tugging in this movie, and the fact of the matter is that it is so real you can't help but cry or come close to doing so. Films rarely show this side of war, and it's a very discomforting one. There is no trouble-ending miracle, there is no Hollywood ending; this movie showcases a true-to-life representation of suffering innocence in one of history's darkest hours. And a film this powerful can ONLY be shown in animation, because live-action would've felt scripted and unconvincing.If you think that anime is nothing more than science-fiction joyrides and fanboy fantasies, ""Grave of the Fireflies"" will change your mind, as well as how you see the world and yourself.",5,"A powerful, moving, and beautiful anime movie.",1020211200,"05 1, 2002",2002,1931,"['What', 'do', 'think', 'when', 'think', 'anime', 'Giant', 'robots', 'Cute', 'girls', 'big', 'eyes', 'Magic', 'martial', 'arts', 'blended', 'together', 'Kiddie', 'stuff', 'Well', 'throw', 'ideas', 'out', 'Grave', 'Fireflies', 'nothing', 'fact', 'as', 'close', 'live', 'action', 'movie', 'can', 'get', 'animation', 'So', 'why', 'animated', 'first', 'place', 'animation', 'only', 'way', 'movie', 'could', 'portray', 'message', 'guess', 'what', 'so', 'exceptionally', 'well', ""'ll"", 'be', 'changed', 'watching', 'movie.The', 'plot', 'movie', 'teenager', 'Seita', 'little', 'sister', 'Setsuko', 'struggle', 'survive', 'Japan', 'World', 'War', 'II', 'mother', 'had', 'died', 'bomb', 'raid', 'live', 'aunt', 'Trouble', ""n't"", 'think', 'much', ""'re"", 'more', 'burden', 'hard', 'times', 'war', 'go', 'out', 'live', 'own', 'are', 'soon', 'plagued', 'problems', 'such', 'lack', 'money', 'food', 'Setsuko', 'eventually', 'malnutrition', 'Seita', 'later', 'train', 'station.At', 'very', 'beginning', 'film', ""'ll"", 'see', 'just', 'deep', 'film', 'very', 'first', 'scene', 'shows', 'Seita', 'dying', 'rest', 'film', 'deals', 'how', 'life', 'spiraled', 'downward', 'eventual', 'death', 'extreme', 'emotion-tugging', 'movie', 'fact', 'matter', 'so', 'real', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'cry', 'come', 'close', 'doing', 'so', 'Films', 'rarely', 'show', 'side', 'war', 'very', 'discomforting', 'one', 'trouble-ending', 'miracle', 'Hollywood', 'ending', 'movie', 'true-to-life', 'representation', 'suffering', 'innocence', 'one', 'history', 'darkest', 'hours', 'film', 'powerful', 'can', 'ONLY', 'be', 'shown', 'animation', 'live-action', 'would', ""'ve"", 'felt', 'scripted', 'unconvincing.If', 'think', 'anime', 'nothing', 'more', 'science-fiction', 'joyrides', 'fanboy', 'fantasies', 'Grave', 'Fireflies', 'will', 'change', 'mind', 'as', 'well', 'how', 'see', 'world']",N/A

Despite main characters' nationality, the bitter surviving story of war victims transcends borders: Seita and Setsuko is every child on a war-torn street.""Grave of the Fireflies"" is an anti-war movie focuses on humanity. Unlike many films of the same genre, it does less with shocking spectators with a war's cruelty, but rather, it draws people in to empathize with the victims of conflicting states.Setsuko and Seita were devastatingly helpless, I feel.The protrayal of emotion is effectively animated. In fact, every character in the story was all too human. Every gesture and expression was done in the most realistic details that mirror the mental state of characters.For example (possible spoiler), after Seita was released from the police for trying to steal some food to solve Setsuko's malnutrition problem, Seita's attempt to hold himself from crying out in front of his concerning sister is simply a masterpiece. It's difficult not to hate yourself for unable to protect your object of affection in the slightest sense (Setsuko IS the family). I don't cry for a movie, but by then, my own tear already fell to mirror his. This is only an animation....Everything in this anime is top notch, though I highly recommend you to watch in the original voice, instead of English dub. Tones and emotions are almost robotic or misinterpreted in the English version. The subtitle of the translucent box version I bought sometimes lagged a little bit (while the black box version I had rented was better). I hope these dubbing problems will be solve in the collector's version.If you love great animation with compelling story, skillfully done animation, and don't mind crying involuntarily, well, don't waste your time listen to my last words.:`)",5,Heartfeltly Thumbs Up,1032134400,"09 16, 2002",2002,1834,"['story', 'Grave', 'Fireflies', 'place', 'end', 'WWII', 'Tokyo', 'Japan', 'main', 'characters', 'nationality', 'bitter', 'surviving', 'story', 'war', 'victims', 'borders', 'Seita', 'Setsuko', 'child', 'war-torn', 'street', 'Grave', 'Fireflies', 'anti-war', 'movie', 'humanity', 'many', 'films', 'same', 'genre', 'less', 'shocking', 'spectators', 'war', 'cruelty', 'rather', 'people', 'empathize', 'victims', 'conflicting', 'states.Setsuko', 'Seita', 'were', 'devastatingly', 'helpless', 'feel.The', 'protrayal', 'emotion', 'effectively', 'animated', 'fact', 'character', 'story', 'was', 'too', 'human', 'gesture', 'expression', 'was', 'done', 'most', 'realistic', 'details', 'mirror', 'mental', 'state', 'characters.For', 'example', 'possible', 'spoiler', 'Seita', 'was', 'released', 'police', 'trying', 'steal', 'food', 'solve', 'Setsuko', 'malnutrition', 'problem', 'Seita', 'attempt', 'hold', 'crying', 'out', 'front', 'concerning', 'sister', 'simply', 'masterpiece', 'difficult', 'not', 'hate', 'unable', 'protect', 'object', 'affection', 'slightest', 'sense', 'Setsuko', 'family', 'do', ""n't"", 'cry', 'movie', 'then', 'own', 'tear', 'already', 'fell', 'mirror', 'only', 'animation', '.Everything', 'anime', 'top', 'notch', 'highly', 'recommend', 'watch', 'original', 'voice', 'instead', 'English', 'dub', 'Tones', 'emotions', 'are', 'almost', 'robotic', 'misinterpreted', 'English', 'version', 'subtitle', 'translucent', 'box', 'version', 'bought', 'sometimes', 'lagged', 'little', 'bit', 'black', 'box', 'version', 'had', 'rented', 'was', 'better', 'hope', 'dubbing', 'problems', 'will', 'be', 'solve', 'collector', 'version.If', 'love', 'great', 'animation', 'compelling', 'story', 'skillfully', 'done', 'animation', 'do', ""n't"", 'mind', 'crying', 'involuntarily', 'well', 'do', ""n't"", 'waste', 'time', 'listen', 'last', 'words']",N/A

(Amazon seemed to combine every version into the same review)Art/Animation - well done for 1980's standard, no issues that others reported.Sound - also well done, again no audio issues that others reported.This movie is a very touching and well told story of war from a child's view.  This movie does not try and paint Japan as a victim nor does it try and paint the American's as demons in fact I wouldn't say it was anit-war.  It paints a picture of a boy and his sister having a stable life and slowly over time losing everything.  At no point does any character go into any dialogue about the war other than when Seita learns Japan lost.  I see some of the chief complaints as the boy runs off when the Aunt starts complaining and so on and so forth. There can be two reasons for this, poor translations or poor acting.  The scene is painted that as the war continues to get worse the Aunt is growing more and more frustrated at her increased burden of care and as food becomes scares she can't hide her feelings. As I watched the scene the dialogue seemed forced and awkward so I am leaning towards poor translation. Seita decides to leave the Aunt's care taking his little sister with him and again the Aunt says something that I think was mistranslated.  Seita and his sister move into an abandoned cave next to a lake and for awhile things are okay.  But slowly over time they run out of food and they have to resort to more desperate measures to survive. Again, there is no vilifying of either side, Seita just tries to survive.The hard part.Over time Seita's little sister Setsuko is withering away from malnutrition (forcing Seita to do more and more daring things to find food) but to no avail.  The film does a bad job of conveying this to us on three parts.  First, the animation of the girl doesn't portray her getting thinner, they do slowly draw red dots on her over time and in the end her eyes are small but she still looks the same size as the move goes on. Second, there is no sense of time in this movie.  It starts off and they say it is September 45 and that is the last time you know what date it is.  Third, possible translation or bad writing, the Aunt was the turning point of the story it was a pivotal part and it wasn't done right, so it messes up the film later on.  Towards the end the farmer tells Seita there is no more food go back to your Aunt and he refuses ... based on what the film presented it made Seita seem callous and directly resulted in the end result but it really feels like we (the audience) was missing something. Pride is one thing, stupidity is another, Seita at no time demonstrates either until that point, thus way out of character. Even stranger, at the end of the movie it seems like Seita has a handle on the situation with acquiring food because they have scene after scene of him getting food.Final thoughts:This movie is sad.  The weight of the story is based on real life grief and regret. A lot of weight and responsibility landed on Seita from the get go of the movie and he tried his best, and it just wasn't enough. To me it seemed like the harsh moments were toned down or not adequately translated and misconstrued the point.",5,"Very well done movie, worth watching (not for children)",1396742400,"04 6, 2014",2014,3225,"['purchased', 'blu-ray', 'copy', 'Amazon', 'seemed', 'combine', 'version', 'same', 'review', 'Art/Animation', 'well', 'done', '1980', 'standard', 'issues', 'others', 'reported.Sound', 'also', 'well', 'done', 'again', 'audio', 'issues', 'others', 'reported.This', 'movie', 'very', 'touching', 'well', 'told', 'story', 'war', 'child', 'view', 'movie', 'not', 'try', 'paint', 'Japan', 'victim', 'try', 'paint', 'American', 'demons', 'fact', 'would', ""n't"", 'say', 'was', 'anit-war', 'picture', 'boy', 'sister', 'having', 'stable', 'life', 'slowly', 'time', 'losing', 'everything', 'point', 'character', 'go', 'dialogue', 'war', 'other', 'when', 'Seita', 'Japan', 'lost', 'see', 'chief', 'complaints', 'boy', 'when', 'Aunt', 'complaining', 'so', 'so', 'forth', 'can', 'be', 'two', 'reasons', 'poor', 'translations', 'poor', 'acting', 'scene', 'painted', 'war', 'get', 'worse', 'Aunt', 'growing', 'more', 'more', 'frustrated', 'increased', 'burden', 'care', 'food', 'becomes', 'ca', ""n't"", 'hide', 'feelings', 'watched', 'scene', 'dialogue', 'seemed', 'forced', 'awkward', 'so', 'am', 'leaning', 'towards', 'poor', 'translation', 'Seita', 'leave', 'Aunt', 'care', 'taking', 'little', 'sister', 'again', 'Aunt', 'something', 'think', 'was', 'mistranslated', 'Seita', 'sister', 'move', 'abandoned', 'cave', 'next', 'lake', 'awhile', 'things', 'are', 'okay', 'slowly', 'time', 'run', 'food', 'have', 'resort', 'more', 'desperate', 'measures', 'survive', 'Again', 'vilifying', 'side', 'Seita', 'just', 'survive.The', 'hard', 'part.Over', 'time', 'Seita', 'little', 'sister', 'Setsuko', 'withering', 'away', 'malnutrition', 'forcing', 'Seita', 'do', 'more', 'more', 'daring', 'things', 'find', 'food', 'avail', 'film', 'bad', 'job', 'conveying', 'three', 'parts', 'First', 'animation', 'girl', ""n't"", 'portray', 'getting', 'thinner', 'do', 'slowly', 'draw', 'red', 'dots', 'time', 'end', 'eyes', 'are', 'small', 'still', 'same', 'size', 'move', 'Second', 'sense', 'time', 'movie', 'say', 'September', '45', 'last', 'time', 'know', 'what', 'date', 'Third', 'possible', 'translation', 'bad', 'writing', 'Aunt', 'was', 'turning', 'point', 'story', 'was', 'pivotal', 'part', 'was', ""n't"", 'done', 'right', 'up', 'film', 'later', 'end', 'farmer', 'Seita', 'more', 'food', 'go', 'back', 'Aunt', 'based', 'what', 'film', 'presented', 'made', 'Seita', 'seem', 'callous', 'directly', 'resulted', 'end', 'result', 'really', 'audience', 'was', 'missing', 'something', 'Pride', 'one', 'thing', 'stupidity', 'Seita', 'time', 'either', 'point', 'thus', 'way', 'character', 'Even', 'stranger', 'end', 'movie', 'Seita', 'handle', 'situation', 'acquiring', 'food', 'have', 'scene', 'scene', 'getting', 'food.Final', 'thoughts', 'movie', 'sad', 'weight', 'story', 'based', 'real', 'life', 'grief', 'regret', 'lot', 'weight', 'responsibility', 'landed', 'Seita', 'get', 'go', 'movie', 'tried', 'best', 'just', 'was', ""n't"", 'enough', 'seemed', 'harsh', 'moments', 'were', 'toned', 'down', 'not', 'adequately', 'translated', 'misconstrued', 'point']",N/A

A great film critic told me that great films aren't depressing. Only terrible movies are. He is right. Great films can make you cry, but why should that make them depressing? That means the movie hits you on an emotional level, which is what the greatest movies do. I'm convinced now that the best animators in the world aren't from Disney. They're from Japan, like Hayao Miyazaki (the greatest living animator in the world) and Isao Takahata, a colleague of Miyazaki's who made this one. This film is so emotionally powerful that it actually succeeded in fulfilling another requirement I have about great movies. It makes me forget I'm watching the movie and make me feel as if I actually am INSIDE the film, experiencing what the characters are feeling. The movie is happening to me. If that last line sounds like a cliche to you, okay. So what? Great movies do that to you, and GRAVE OF THE FIRELFIES did it to me.The story is simple. Two Japanese siblings, a 14 year old boy and a 4 year old girl lose their parents in WWII, and it isn't long before they are completely on their own. They end up relying only on themselves to stay alive. The film was adapted from a highly acclaimed book in Japan, which I've been told is based on the real WWII experiences of its author.Like the greatest animated films I've seen this one is filled with images of complete originality and power. The only one I will mention in this review is a shot of a bunch of fireflies surrounding the children. It's a scene of indescribable beauty. But what happens after that turns it into a scene of unbelievable sadness. By the end of the film tears were in my eyes, something I usually don't do while watching a movie.If a film tells me it's based on a true story, that doesn't always get my attention. Isao Takahata wisely does not let audiences know this at any point in the movie, but what really made this film hit me emotionally is that it happens to two innocent Japanese children. They're the victims of our American military forces. And let us remember that we just bombed the country of Iraq. What if there are right now two Iraqi children, brother and sister, who are victims of the bombings we have done? What if they too have to fend for themselves just to stay alive? Perhaps with this highly likely scenario playing out for real, this film is perfect viewing for 2003, fifteen years after its original releaseGRAVE OF THE FIREFLIES ties with SPIRITED AWAY and PRINCESS MONONOKE as the greatest animated film ever made.

The characters are absorbing, the animation is gorgeous, and the film itself is very well-detailed in showing the plight of the typical Japanese family during the waning days of World War II. This is a film that is accurate enough from a historical level to be shown in Japanese schools when reviewing World War II.If the movie is so great, then, why four stars instead of five?In art, I believe there is something to be said about giving the audience what they want. We want to see our protagonists put through the wringer, and sometimes we even want a depressing ending. But there is a boundary to how much emotional pain we're okay with sitting through, and Grave of the Fireflies pushes right up against that boundary. The story follows along the lives of Seita and his younger sister Setsuko, two orphaned children in the war. Right from the beginning, you know that things are going to end poorly for them. And because the film is so well-executed and the characters are so likable, it really hurts to watch these kids suffer. I don't think Grave of the Fireflies crosses a line that shouldn't be crossed, but it's definitely a film that is going to hit you hard.

With such a grim topic like war, you'd think those films would've made me cry, well nope. While the war scenes were superbly staged, the emotional content was missing, as if the only reason you wanted to care was because it was people dying. But when you actually care about them, it goes beyond just a simple caring, you feel like you lost someone as well. This film more than any anti-war film shows that horrors can happen to everyone, not just soldiers.Seito and Setsuko are brother and sister living in WWII-era Japan. A bombing raid forces both of them to retreat and they end up in a shelter. From there they have to deal with an overbearing aunt, trying to keep Setsuko calm while bombs are being dropped and hunger. So we follow the 2 of them living day to day just trying to survive.Brad Bird, who worked on the Simpsons and obviously did Iron Giant and the Incredibles, tends to get upset when people call animation a genre, saying instead it's another way to tell a story. The story just happens to be animated and I agree. Granted, animation has its own look, much like B&W; versus color but animation is simply storytelling but with pencils rather than sets. And if there was ever a case where animation can be art, Fireflies sure makes a strong one. Make no mistake, this is a really depressing film. By the end, I was literally in tears. The subject matter's grim enough but what plays out is quite sad.I watched the Japanese sub and I don't know if I want to try the English one but the Japanese one was perfect, especially Setsuko who just sounded adorable and heartbreaking when she feels ill. I actually couldn't find the Special Edition one with some goodies on it so the only features on here where trailers and the option of watching the film storyboarded. It's not much but I'll probably pick up the bigger release later on.Even though I do think the film's masterpiece level, I probably will only watch it a few times.

The voice belongs to 14-year-old Seita, and his spirit tells us what happened to him and his five-year-old sister, Setsuko, in the weeks before. This is one of the saddest films I've ever seen, but a great one. Elements of the plot are discussed, but we know what's going to happen with that first sentence.Seita, his mother and sister live in Kobe, Japan. One day American bombers hit the city in a fire bomb raid. Their mother is terribly burned and dies shortly after in a crowded hospital. They haven't heard from their father, a naval officer serving on a cruiser, in a long time. We assume he is dead. Their home is destroyed and Seita takes his sister to his aunt and her family. Things don't work out. Food is short. The aunt becomes more abrupt and impatient with Seita when she realizes the children may be staying permanently. Seita takes his sister to a hill one evening to watch the thousands of fireflies, which delights Setsuko. Seita finally decides to take his sister and live by themselves in an abandoned bomb shelter dug into the side of a river cliff. What money he has proves useless as food is increasingly hard to find. Slowly the two children slip down into malnutrition and sickness. Seita is responsible for his sister and tries to keep her spirits up when she cries for her mother or tells him how hungry she is, but there is no one to take care of Seita. They suffer rashes. Seita tries to comb the lice from Setsuko's hair. Setsuko begins to suffer from diarrhea. Without family, no one wants them. One night he catches fireflies in a can and releases them in the cave for Setsuko. The next morning he finds his sister digging a grave for the fireflies, who have all died. ""Why must fireflies die so young,"" but there's no answer to the question. Soon after, Setsuko dies. Seita cremates his sister and carries her ashes in a box with him. And on September 21, in the Kobe railway station, surrounded by other lost, homeless people, Seita dies.This is undoubtedly one of he great anti-war movies. There is also a moral lesson, which director Isao Takahata points out, in hubris. Seita makes a decision which is disastrous for himself and his sister, but it is a decision of a 14-year-old who has had to assume responsibilities far beyond what he should. The relationship between the two children, their love for each other, Setsuko's trust in him and Seita's determination to care for her is a heartbreaker.The film is stunningly drawn, from nightmarish scenes of incendiary bomb attacks on wooden neighborhoods to achingly beautiful scenes of seashores, valleys and rain storms. Takahata and his animators have given Seita and Setsuko so much character and individuality that we see them as children, not animated subjects.Film critic Roger Ebert, in a commentary on the film, says that the first time he saw the movie he nearly cried. So did I. This is a sad, powerful film. The two disc DVD features a stunning transfer and several extras. Among them are the Ebert interview, an interview with the director and an historical overview of the period.",5,"A Great, Tragic Film",1140566400,"02 22, 2006",2006,3166,"['first', 'sentence', 'movie', 'September', '21', '1945', 'was', 'night', 'died', 'voice', 'belongs', '14-year-old', 'Seita', 'spirit', 'happened', 'five-year-old', 'sister', 'Setsuko', 'weeks', 'before', 'one', 'saddest', 'films', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'seen', 'great', 'one', 'Elements', 'plot', 'are', 'discussed', 'know', 'what', 'going', 'happen', 'first', 'sentence.Seita', 'mother', 'sister', 'live', 'Kobe', 'Japan', 'One', 'day', 'American', 'bombers', 'hit', 'city', 'fire', 'bomb', 'raid', 'mother', 'terribly', 'burned', 'dies', 'shortly', 'crowded', 'hospital', 'have', ""n't"", 'heard', 'father', 'naval', 'officer', 'serving', 'cruiser', 'long', 'time', 'assume', 'dead', 'home', 'destroyed', 'Seita', 'sister', 'aunt', 'family', 'Things', 'do', ""n't"", 'work', 'out', 'Food', 'short', 'aunt', 'more', 'abrupt', 'impatient', 'Seita', 'when', 'children', 'may', 'be', 'staying', 'permanently', 'Seita', 'sister', 'hill', 'one', 'evening', 'watch', 'thousands', 'fireflies', 'Setsuko', 'Seita', 'finally', 'take', 'sister', 'live', 'abandoned', 'bomb', 'shelter', 'dug', 'side', 'river', 'cliff', 'What', 'money', 'useless', 'food', 'increasingly', 'hard', 'find', 'Slowly', 'two', 'children', 'slip', 'down', 'malnutrition', 'sickness', 'Seita', 'responsible', 'sister', 'tries', 'keep', 'spirits', 'up', 'when', 'mother', 'how', 'hungry', 'one', 'take', 'care', 'Seita', 'suffer', 'rashes', 'Seita', 'comb', 'lice', 'Setsuko', 'hair', 'Setsuko', 'suffer', 'diarrhea', 'family', 'one', 'One', 'night', 'fireflies', 'can', 'releases', 'cave', 'Setsuko', 'next', 'morning', 'sister', 'digging', 'grave', 'fireflies', 'who', 'have', 'died', 'Why', 'must', 'fireflies', 'die', 'so', 'young', 'answer', 'question', 'Soon', 'Setsuko', 'Seita', 'sister', 'ashes', 'box', 'September', '21', 'Kobe', 'railway', 'station', 'surrounded', 'other', 'lost', 'homeless', 'people', 'Seita', 'dies.This', 'undoubtedly', 'one', 'great', 'anti-war', 'movies', 'also', 'moral', 'lesson', 'director', 'Isao', 'Takahata', 'points', 'out', 'hubris', 'Seita', 'decision', 'disastrous', 'sister', 'decision', '14-year-old', 'who', 'had', 'assume', 'responsibilities', 'far', 'what', 'should', 'relationship', 'two', 'children', 'love', 'other', 'Setsuko', 'trust', 'Seita', 'determination', 'care', 'heartbreaker.The', 'film', 'stunningly', 'drawn', 'nightmarish', 'scenes', 'incendiary', 'bomb', 'attacks', 'wooden', 'neighborhoods', 'achingly', 'beautiful', 'scenes', 'seashores', 'valleys', 'rain', 'storms', 'Takahata', 'animators', 'have', 'given', 'Seita', 'Setsuko', 'so', 'much', 'character', 'individuality', 'see', 'children', 'not', 'animated', 'subjects.Film', 'critic', 'Roger', 'Ebert', 'commentary', 'film', 'first', 'time', 'saw', 'movie', 'nearly', 'cried', 'So', 'did', 'sad', 'powerful', 'film', 'two', 'disc', 'DVD', 'stunning', 'transfer', 'several', 'extras', 'are', 'Ebert', 'interview', 'interview', 'director', 'historical', 'overview', 'period']",N/A

To me, Grave Of The Fireflies is better than all the Stanley Kubrick, George Lucas, and Steven Spielberg (I think I spelled their names right) films COMBINED. When people think of anime, they think of giant robots, fighters, wit, cute and/or busty babes (I love you Ryoko!), and creatures that don't even exist--Grave Of The Fireflies has none of that at all. Instead, this film is as sickingly realistic as it gets. There's nothing even remotely imaginative to it. At the end, it not only leaves your emotions and feelings completely crushed, but leaves you with the grime reality of what war is, and the single question many fail to answer is left as a reminder to it lingering in your head for days afterwards--what does war ever accomplish? Nothing, absolutely nothing. VERY emotionally exhausting. And to think, anime outsiders say anime is nothing but sci-fi Pokemon junk...I beg to differ.",5,I Cried After Watching This...,976233600,"12 8, 2000",2000,1323,"['am', 'NOT', 'ashamed', 'admit', 'not', 'could', 'help', 'either', 'movie', 'huge', 'crushing', 'blow', 'human', 'spirit', 'review', 'gon', 'na', 'be', 'short', 'everyone', 'already', 'said', 'everything', 'needed', 'be', 'said', 'written', 'much', 'better', 'were', 'do', 'so', 'teenage', 'boy', 'little', 'sister', 'devastation', 'WWII', 'surroundings', 'what', 'Grave', 'Fireflies', 'about', 'Grave', 'Fireflies', 'better', 'Stanley', 'Kubrick', 'George', 'Lucas', 'Steven', 'Spielberg', 'think', 'spelled', 'names', 'right', 'films', 'COMBINED', 'When', 'people', 'think', 'anime', 'think', 'giant', 'robots', 'fighters', 'wit', 'cute', 'and/or', 'busty', 'babes', 'love', 'Ryoko', 'creatures', 'do', ""n't"", 'even', 'exist', 'Grave', 'Fireflies', 'none', 'Instead', 'film', 'sickingly', 'realistic', 'nothing', 'even', 'remotely', 'imaginative', 'end', 'not', 'only', 'emotions', 'feelings', 'completely', 'crushed', 'grime', 'reality', 'what', 'war', 'single', 'question', 'many', 'fail', 'answer', 'left', 'reminder', 'lingering', 'head', 'days', 'afterwards', 'what', 'war', 'ever', 'accomplish', 'Nothing', 'absolutely', 'nothing', 'VERY', 'emotionally', 'exhausting', 'think', 'anime', 'outsiders', 'say', 'anime', 'nothing', 'sci-fi', 'Pokemon', 'junk', 'beg', 'differ']",N/A

The two children struggle to survive and even find a little happiness in a country that is undergoing extreme privation.  It is heartbreaking to watch Seita trying to protect his little sister.  The film is apolitical; rather than taking sides and laying blame, it strives to depict the complex ways in which human nature expresses itself under impossible circumstances.

183199,A204ETWOV23HO4,156219464X,"David J. Huber ""Addicted to books!""","[110, 120]","First off, to get this out of the way, you should be watching this movie so you can know how beautiful and incredible animation can be - this is a  visually gorgeous and lush movie.Beyond the animation, Grave of the  Fireflies is truly in the top of perfectly written scripts. The subject  matter of the film is war and death, but specifically how war affects the  innocents. This is Japan in the end months of WWII during the firebombings,  when food was scarce, and children without parents were left to die.This  story is incredibly sad, but so important to hear and see it - not like a  mainstream Hollywood sad movie that might make you cry while watching, but  otherwise has no power to alter your perceptions of life. This is truly sad  - the young kids die, and they die very horribly - sickness and starvation.  The whole process is so well-written, you'll feel the hunger and the  sickness yourself, and the animation adds to the effect.It is so welcome  to have a movie that doesn't turn out all right in the end, but turns out  awfully darn depressing, because a lot of times, life just plain sucks and  isn't fair, if not for me, then for many other people.  It is good to  remember that not everything always turns out okay, and nothing is wrong in  showing this realistically in a movie.  Would I show this to young kids?  Hell yes - I think young kids would identify very strongly.  And if we can  get our young kids to see the ridiculous nature of war at an early age,  mayhaps we shall finally have a generation that doesn't feel a need to kill  each other over irrelevant philosophic, racial, genetic, geographic, etc.,  BS.This movie and the story has not left my mind since I saw it - a  point of proof that this is an incredible movie. But do be prepared to feel  amazingly sad. I saw this movie in the winter. Then about 5 months later,  in the summer, when I saw my first fireflies of the year, I was overcome  with an incredible sadness.  That's how powerful this movie is.I will be  using this with my youth groups, probably for many years.  It has so much  worthy of deconstructing and analyzing - this is truly artwork, for it does  all things that art is supposed to do - it has the power to change you, and  the power to not let you forget the story. Excellent all the way  around!And make sure to get one that is letterboxed, to get the whole  movie (why are movies even released without being letterboxed? People are  stupid...). And get a copy that is in Japanese with subtitles (unless, of  course, you speak Japanese).  You really, really have to hear the original  Japanese, and the original actors. Amazing movie.

183200,A2FRKEXDXDN1KI,156219464X,Dennis A. Amith (kndy),"[7, 7]","There are films that stay with you and you can remember how devastated or how heartbroken you were after you watched it.In my 18-years of reviewing anime, ""Grave of the Fireflies"" is one of the few few films that I have reviewed a few times in which no matter how many times I have viewed it, I am left with tears streaming down my face and left emotionally devastated.""Hotaru no Haka"" (Grave of the Fireflies) is a anime adaptation by director Iaso Takahata (co-founder of Studio Ghibli) and is based on a semi-autobiographic novel by Nosaka Akiyuki, which the story is based on his childhood experience during World War II.The film has received primarily fantastic reviews and while we have seen various video releases of ""Grave of the Fireflies"" and a previous collector's edition on DVD nearly a decade ago, the Sentai Filmworks DVD release of ""Grave of the Fireflies"" released in March 2012 featured a new digitally remastered and restored version of the film.  And now here we are with the Blu-ray release that features the film in 1080p High Definition but also featuring both English and Japanese soundtracks in DTS-HD Master Audio 2.0 and also featuring the original 1988 English dub soundtrack.VIDEO:""Grave of the Fireflies"" is presented in 1080p High Definition and uses the HD digitally restored version that was released in Japan back in July 2012.  While watching the film, you notice how much clarity there is with the colors, how art backgrounds are much more detailed.  Colors are vibrant and during my viewing, I didn't notice any problems with the picture quality whatsoever.  This is a solid restoration and fans should be happy with this Blu-ray release of ""Grave of the Fireflies"".AUDIO:""Grave of the Fireflies"" is presented with three soundtracks.  You get the new Sentai Filmworks English DTS-HD Master Audio 2.0 soundtrack, the original Japanese soundtrack in DTS-HD MA but now included is the original 1988 English dub that many people grew up watching when it was first released in the United States.  With the first two lossless tracks, there is better dynamic range, while the original, which sounds good but is not as robust.  Apparently, the original master for the original English dub is lost, so a duplicate track had to be used.Regardless, the film sounds wonderful in HD and the fact that Sentai Filmworks included the original soundtrack is a bonus (note: this was not included in Sentai Filmworks original DVD release earlier this year) and I'm grateful for Sentai Filmworks for adding that.SPECIAL FEATURES:""Grave of the Fireflies"" comes with the following special features:Storyboards for Grave of the Fireflies - (1:28:33) Watch the film with the original storyboards.Deleted Scene 1 Storyboards - (1:53)Deleted Scene 2 Storyboards - (:38)Japanese Trailer - (1:47) The original Japanese theatrical trailer for ""Hotaru no Haka"" (Grave of the Fireflies).JUDGMENT CALL:Sure, if you are a cinema fan, there are war films that do a magnificent job of capturing the emotion and toll on humanity, may they be the Italian neorealist films of the past to various documentaries on genocide, but I have always considered ""Grave of the Fireflies"" as one of the greatest war films ever made.Sure, the film is animated but by no means, should anyone discount this film as anything less. And the fact that you have the name of Studio Ghibli behind this wonderful film, you know that you are getting a quality animated film with a well-written and also deep storyline.I remember watching this film for the very first time, I watched it along with my girlfriend and brother and neither of us knew what to expect.  And by the end of the film, the three of us were in tears, emotionally devastated.Years later, I came across a wall scroll with the picture of the character Setsuko and to this day, over 15-years later, the scroll is hung up on my bathroom as a reminder that life is precious, enjoy life but also not to help those in need.But the more I learned about the film overtime, I often thought about the original writer Nosaka Akiyuki.  The film is based on Nosaka's experience of the bombings and how it took his family but the novel was a form of therapy for the writer as he had blamed himself for many years for the death of his younger sister who died of malnutrition.And watching this film, although director Isao Takahata has said many times that this was not an anti-war film but a film about a brother and sister trying to survive after being isolated from society, having watched this film several times in the last two decades and even now, I still feel that the efficacy of ""Grave of the Fireflies"" lies in its message of the brutality of war but also how society reacted to those in need.The brutality of war is logical, but in the story of these two characters trying to survive after the war, it was heartbreaking to see that those who survived the war and still had homes, there were a few who were not as sympathetic to these individuals who lost everything.  Even for a young teenage boy such as Keita and his young 4-year-old sister, there was a barely anyone wanting to help these children.As a viewer, you were drawn to these children as we see the innocent brother and sister and eventually see the transition of two enthusiastic children full of life, including a slightly plump Setsuko but later to see them losing that enthusiasm and the site of a thin and near skeletal young 4-year-old is a devastating image.  You see the doctor telling Keita that she needs food, and he yells back ""where do you expect me to get food?""...  It's heartbreaking because it's a different experience for those of us in the West who expect some sort of government assistance.  Who is there to help the children?  No one?And at the time, when I first watched this film, I found it heartbreaking that no one would step-in to help these children, may it be the doctor, the adults or anyone who knew of the children's plight, including the farmers.  I couldn't fathom it.  But to contrast this film was Hirokazu Kore-eda's ""Nobody Knows"", another film based on a true story but this time, children in Japan via the 1990&#8242;s and the result is similar for both films.  Boys having to play parent and raise their sibling(s), taking on that responsibility.  And while part of us hopes they can do it, we know deep inside that these young individuals thrust into that world of having to harden themselves and bear the responsibility of an acting parent is going to end in failure.  There is no money, there is no work to make money and without money, there is no food, no medicine...nothing.But the overall efficacy of ""Grave of the Fireflies"" is its pacing but how it gives the viewers that time to see the tragedy unfold, but then seeing a child of innocence, wide-eyed, smiles and then its lasting image of a goodbye to the character which resonates in our mind of how war is so brutal and hoping for those who experience the film, to do something positive with that emotional being of helping those in need.  Not just in wartime but knowing that there are many people out there, who are in need.As for the Blu-ray release, the 2012 edition of ""Grave of the Fireflies"", watching this film in HD, I was very pleased to see the digital restoration of this film.  Back when I reviewed the Sentai Filmworks DVD release, I questioned why it was not released on Blu-ray and on DVD (where in Japan, the Blu-ray was released).  But several months later and fortunately, American audiences now get a definitive version of the film on Blu-ray.  While the clarity, sharpness and vibrancy of the film was expetected HD and also more dynamic range with the Japanese and English lossless soundtracks, the big surprise for me was the inclusion of the original 1988 English dub.  Many of us who watched this film in the early '90s, grew up with this English dub and the fact that Sentai Filmworks has included it on this Blu-ray is fantastic!And another plus is that this Blu-ray release comes with four special features which the DVD version did not.  With that being said, not all special features from Japan made it into this Sentai Filmworks Blu-ray release.  The 18-minute interview with director Isao Takahata and the 12-minute interview with film critic Roger Ebert are missing.  There is also a 58-minute special feature with the animation director, art director, music director, color scheme and assistant animation director that was included in the Japanese Blu-ray release which would have been fantastic to see any of these.  But unfortunately, they are only on the Japanese Blu-ray release only.Still, this is the best version of the film I have watched of the film and for those who invested in the DVD back in July, unfortunately, I have to say that it is worth upgrading to the Blu-ray release because it looks so much better and with the addition of the 1988 English dub and special features, especially for this Blu-ray release's low price-point, it's the definitive version to own!Overall, ""Grave of the Fireflies"" is a profound film that still makes me cry no matter how many times I see it, and resonates strongly with me because of its heartbreaking storyline.  It's definitely one of the best war films out there and should be experienced!  If you have never watched this film before, I highly recommend that you do.",5,(4.5 stars) Blu-ray: A much better release over the Summer 2012 DVD release.

The movie is masterfully directed, the scenes are intelligent and meaningful. The timing of cuts between scenes is some of the best I`ve ever seen. This is story telling at its best. The animation quality is wonderful, but there are no self-advertising &quot;behold, dynamic camera angles and a huge explosion!&quot; scenes because the animation is a tool used to tell the story, rather than the story an excuse to show off the animation.

183202,A3CN9CCJUNIPKT,156219464X,DJ Joe Sixpack,"[1, 1]","""Grave Of The Fireflies""------------------------------------Note: mild spoilers below------------------------------------Aesthetically beautiful and emotionally harrowing, this historical drama is told in the style of Japanese ""anime"" cartoons, with radiant backdrops that contrast the beauty of the Japanese landscape with the gray, bitter ugliness of war. Two children, adolescent Seita and his helpless younger sister, Setsuko, are orphaned after the Allied firebombing of Tokyo; they struggle to survive in the broken society of the war's final months, but it is a losing battle, waged among the privation and militaristic chauvinism of wartime Empire. The story's end is given at its very start: we witness Seita dying of starvation in a Tokyo subway tunnel, and as his ghost meets that of his already-dead sister, he flashes back to the air raids that shattered his life, and we the audience watch their deaths slowly, inexorably unfold.This is an anxious, discomforting, horrifying film, told with great narrative formalism, technical skill and cinematic depth. And, like its forbear, ""Barefoot Gen"" (which tells the story of the bombing of Hiroshima and the decades-long aftermath), ""Grave Of The Fireflies"" is a powerful historical document, giving a glimpse into 1940s Japan's extremely militarized society, the grim, soul-crushing consequences of their aggression, and the new, modern era of remorseless total warfare that followed. This is, obviously, not recommended for younger children, but for adults and teenagers who wish to explore the human, spiritual consequences of World War Two, this is a powerful experience.

It is a ""must see"" for Miyazaki fans, but I wanted to note something more...Did you know that the little girl, a true prodigy, who voiced the female lead in this for the Japanese version was only 4 or 5 years old (depending on what source you read) at the time? Her voicing of Setsuko is so convincing, so sympathetic, so tragic.So, my recommendation to you is this... watch it first in your native language and get the idea of what is going on.  Then, with a handkerchief at the ready, watch it again subtitled in Japanese.  Be prepared for an experience you will probably never forget.As many have noted, this may be one of the greatest war movies ever made, but I think a better way of putting it is this... it is one of the greatest anti-war movies ever made.

Chen,"[15, 16]","Fifty years before the 1995 Great Hanshin Earthquake devastated parts of the city of Kobe, Japan, the Kansai region's main port city had experienced a similar level of destruction - at the hands of men. Kobe was where Gen. Curtis LeMay's Army Air Force B-29 squadrons began their Japanese firebombing campaign during the final months of World War II.""Grave of the Fireflies"" is the semi-fictional account of two Kobe children whose lives were forever altered by the destruction wrought by the war.  Seita - a boy barely into his teen years - and his four-year-old sister Setsuko are orphaned when their mother dies following the bombing.  What follows is their heart-wrenching tale of survival and desperation in a world where it is increasingly difficult for children to simply live and play as children.Thematically, ""Grave of the Fireflies"" is similar to Steven Spielberg's ""Empire of the Sun,"" which was released the year before.  Like that live-action film, Isao Takahata's film highlights how war can have a profound impact on civilians in the war zone, and that children in particular are not immune from being victims of the selfishness of adults.  The protagonists of both - Jim in ""Empire"" and Seita in ""Fireflies"" - are boys forced to grow up quickly in order to survive.  Seita, however, has the added concern of caring for Setsuko: finding food for both her and himself, and shielding her from the awful truth that their mother died during the bombing.Like Clint Eastwood's more recent ""Letters from Iwo Jima,"" ""Fireflies"" forces American audiences to recognize the basic common humanity of the Japanese during a time when they were considered our nation's mortal enemy... but also the extremes to which people are driven when day-to-day survival is not assured.""Grave of the Fireflies"" is one of the most moving films I have ever seen, whether animation or live action.  The characters did have some flaws - it could be argued that Seita could have acted more humbly while in the home of his haughty aunt.  Those flaws, however, do not detract from the profound emotional impact of the film.  In fact, they highlight that Seita and Setsuko are children, and live their lives with the innocent myopia of children.  It's for that reason, however, that ""Grave of the Fireflies"" reminds all that children must be cared for - even and especially when war ravages a nation - lest their lives shine but for passing moments like fireflies.",5,Immeasurably emotional film,1176422400,"04 13, 2007",2007,2445,"['Fifty', 'years', '1995', 'Great', 'Hanshin', 'Earthquake', 'devastated', 'parts', 'city', 'Kobe', 'Japan', 'Kansai', 'region', 'main', 'port', 'city', 'had', 'experienced', 'similar', 'level', 'destruction', 'hands', 'men', 'Kobe', 'was', 'where', 'Gen.', 'Curtis', 'LeMay', 'Army', 'Air', 'Force', 'B-29', 'squadrons', 'began', 'Japanese', 'firebombing', 'campaign', 'final', 'months', 'World', 'War', 'II', 'Grave', 'Fireflies', 'semi-fictional', 'account', 'two', 'Kobe', 'children', 'lives', 'were', 'forever', 'altered', 'destruction', 'wrought', 'war', 'Seita', 'boy', 'barely', 'teen', 'years', 'four-year-old', 'sister', 'Setsuko', 'are', 'orphaned', 'when', 'mother', 'following', 'bombing', 'What', 'heart-wrenching', 'tale', 'survival', 'desperation', 'world', 'where', 'increasingly', 'difficult', 'children', 'simply', 'live', 'play', 'children.Thematically', 'Grave', 'Fireflies', 'similar', 'Steven', 'Spielberg', 'Empire', 'Sun', 'was', 'released', 'year', 'before', 'live-action', 'film', 'Isao', 'Takahata', 'film', 'highlights', 'how', 'war', 'can', 'have', 'profound', 'impact', 'civilians', 'war', 'zone', 'children', 'particular', 'are', 'not', 'immune', 'being', 'victims', 'selfishness', 'adults', 'protagonists', 'Jim', 'Empire', 'Seita', 'Fireflies', 'are', 'boys', 'forced', 'grow', 'up', 'quickly', 'order', 'survive', 'Seita', 'however', 'added', 'concern', 'caring', 'Setsuko', 'finding', 'food', 'shielding', 'awful', 'truth', 'mother', 'died', 'bombing.Like', 'Clint', 'Eastwood', 'more', 'recent', 'Letters', 'Iwo', 'Jima', 'Fireflies', 'forces', 'American', 'audiences', 'recognize', 'basic', 'common', 'humanity', 'Japanese', 'time', 'when', 'were', 'considered', 'nation', 'mortal', 'enemy', 'also', 'extremes', 'people', 'are', 'driven', 'when', 'day-to-day', 'survival', 'not', 'assured', 'Grave', 'Fireflies', 'one', 'most', 'moving', 'films', 'have', 'ever', 'seen', 'animation', 'live', 'action', 'characters', 'did', 'have', 'flaws', 'could', 'be', 'argued', 'Seita', 'could', 'have', 'acted', 'more', 'humbly', 'home', 'haughty', 'aunt', 'flaws', 'however', 'do', 'not', 'detract', 'profound', 'emotional', 'impact', 'film', 'fact', 'highlight', 'Seita', 'Setsuko', 'are', 'children', 'live', 'lives', 'innocent', 'myopia', 'children', 'reason', 'however', 'Grave', 'Fireflies', 'children', 'must', 'be', 'cared', 'even', 'especially', 'when', 'war', 'nation', 'lest', 'lives', 'shine', 'passing', 'moments', 'fireflies']",N/A

I finally got around to watching Tsutomu Tatsumi's GRAVE OF THE FIREFLIES after months of languishing on my queue list on my online dvd rental service. This haunting animated film proves that not all anime needs to be based in fantasy.This bleak story was inspired by the autobiographical novel of the same title by Akiyuki Nosaka who had lost his sister to malnutrition during World War II. In GRAVES OF THE FIREFLIES, the main characters of the film is Seita, the older brother, and Setsuko, the younger sister. It is World War II. Japan is subjected to the frequent air raids by the west. Seita and Setsuko loses their mother to the bombs while their father is in the navy and has not been heard from in awhile. After losing their mother, Seita and Setsuko moves in with their aunt. Their aunt is anything but kind and loving. She views the children as nothing more than financial burdens on her household. She admonishes Seita for not contributing to the househould finances as well as to the country every opportunity she gets. One day, Seita had enough of his aunt's insults, and takes Setsuko to an abandoned bomb shelter. Seita's selfish pride would eventually prove to be his undoing and would lead to tragedy in the end of the film.I loved this film. I was so moved by the imagery and the writing. In a lot of animated films, when someone gets hurt, you don't see the wounds the individual received from his or her attacker but in this film you do, namely with Seita and Setsuko's mother. Their mother was completely unrecognizable in her bandages but you could see the serious wounds by the blood and her facial expression.While the aunt may not have been an angel herself, Seita wasn't exactly perfect himself either. He was selfish by not appreciating the roof and food his aunt provided albeit relunctantly. It never occured to him that he should try to contribute to his aunt's household income given the circumestances that she had two extra mouths to feed. Unfortunately his selfish pride would lead to his downfall when he decides that he and Setsuko would be better off away from his aunt.GRAVE OF THE FIREFLIES is definitely not a kiddie film for young audiences to see. The story and images are bleak and occasionally graphic. The realism in the storyline was so real and authentic, I was moved to tears especially towards the end of the film. This film gave me a good glimpse of life in Japan during WWII. GRAVES OF THE FIREFLIES is a rare gem in animated films and films in general where I am brought to tears.

I must point out that many people seem bent on dwelling on the fact that many Americans died durring the Pacific conflict and a movie about Japanese children is just trying to make us forget about what the Japanese did durring the war. As one other reviewer pointed out, more Americans died in the war with Japan then died in the European conflict. To dispute this, 650,000 white people died in the Civil War(that does not include Black and Native Americans who died). More people died in the Civil War than all other US. conflicts combined. (Includes Vietnam, Korea, WWI, WWII, IraqI, IraqII and whatever we were doing in the 80's). I do not want to put down those who bravely fought for our country, but if you watch this film you will hear no mention of Americans (or USA), we are just called the Enemy, nothing more.

I am not a big anime fan, and most of the ones I do purchase are for my two young daughters. There are only a handful that I have seen which I truly enjoy. Therefore, it came as a big surprise to me when I finally viewed ""Grave Of The Fireflies."" This is not only a terrific anime, but one which you will soon not forget after viewing it. It takes quite a film in order for me to feel that sense of deep sadness that I felt after viewing this film. A truly sad and poignant anime. This film does what so many motion picture dramas fail to do in trying to convey a sense of tragedy and sadness. This is one of the reasons I was so surprised at how sad I felt after viewing it.I own this DVD, and I highly, highly recommend it to everyone. I know that there are many out there who do not like anime films, but this one is completely different. If you do not wish to buy this anime, then when you have the time, I recommend that you at least rent the film from one of your local video stores. There have been outstanding reviews of this anime, therefore I will not repeat what has already been so eloquently written by so many other reviewers. But I will write that this anime is very powerful!!! Up until I saw this anime; no other anime had ever moved or touched me as this one did, and continues to do so. The folly of war; which is always endured upon the innocents that suffer, is truly a universal and tragic condition of the human race.This anime will be timeless, and eternal. It does what so many films fail to show: Mainly that there are consequences to mankind's actions, and that the 'enemy' is human and suffers too. I have seen countless documentaries on the bombings of Japan, China, Burma, eastern Europe, Germany, Vietnam, Cambodia, everywhere in fact--since I was young, and especially when I served in the U.S. Air Force. I have always thought about those on the receiving end of these bombings. Bombs do not discriminate in their carnage. I liked everything about this anime, because it does not cop-out with a happy ending, but gives the viewer the very essence and nature of war: Carnage and death. A truly sad, sad, anime. It belongs right up there with the great anti-war films of all time.

A few years ago, I bought the DVD remembering this was a very good movie and watched it with my husband.  I cried probably harder than I did when I was a child.Other reviewers have given the plot overview, so I won't go into that.  Grave of the Fireflies is, indeed, an elegant film that transcends genre.  This isn't a mere anime film.  Let's remember that anime is an industry in Japan, so there are anime that covers all sorts of topics.  Here in the US, however, cartoons are strictly for children.  This, however, is a war drama -- probably the most memorable, heart-warming, and gut-wrenching war movie I've ever seen.What I loved about this film is it's simplicity and purity.  The star of the show is the story and the characters, not the flashy animation or the history behind the war.  In too many other war movies, the focal point of the show isn't the characters, it's the war.  In this film, however, the two children are definitely the main characters.  Unlike many American animated films, the animation itself isn't the main attraction, either.  The art is beautifully simplistic and elegant.  It shares the same style as Princess Mononoke, Kiki's Delivery Service, Castle in the Sky, and Spirited Away (these films all shared the same director as Grave).  I've seen all these films, and I still think that GotF is the best out of all of them.I cry at movies, I'll admit, but movies lose their emotional impact after the first time.  There's only so many times you can get misty-eyed over what you've already seen before, but Grave of the Fireflies defies this rule, not just for myself, but for many people.  In an interview on the bonus disc, Ebert admits to being moved nearly to tears watching this film.  Even though it's been well over a decade since I first watched it, this film never fails to move me to tears.  What's so amazing about this film is that the heartbreak isn't intentional.  It just portrays what happens when two children pay the price for war, so the plot itself is the mechanism that fuels the emotions -- there's no need for gimmicks.With some films, you get the feeling that the only reason certain bits were added was because the filmmakers wanted to tug at your heartstrings intentionally.  Perhaps what makes this film so poignant is that it's just going about its story and not purposefully trying to be ""sad.""  This is a very honest, simplistic, elegant film that makes a huge emotional impact on its viewers.  It's easily not just the best anime film I've ever seen, but one of the best movies, period, I've ever had the pleasure of watching.",5,"More than 10 years later, I still cry when I watch this film",1108944000,"02 21, 2005",2005,2713,"['first', 'saw', 'movie', 'when', 'was', '11', 'years', 'old', 'stayed', 'mind', 'being', 'saddest', 'movie', 'had', 'ever', 'seen', 'few', 'years', 'ago', 'bought', 'DVD', 'remembering', 'was', 'very', 'good', 'movie', 'watched', 'husband', 'cried', 'probably', 'harder', 'did', 'when', 'was', 'child.Other', 'reviewers', 'have', 'given', 'plot', 'overview', 'wo', ""n't"", 'go', 'Grave', 'Fireflies', 'indeed', 'elegant', 'film', 'genre', ""n't"", 'mere', 'anime', 'film', 'Let', 'remember', 'anime', 'industry', 'Japan', 'so', 'are', 'anime', 'sorts', 'topics', 'Here', 'US', 'however', 'cartoons', 'are', 'strictly', 'children', 'however', 'war', 'drama', 'probably', 'most', 'memorable', 'heart-warming', 'gut-wrenching', 'war', 'movie', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'seen.What', 'loved', 'film', 'simplicity', 'purity', 'star', 'show', 'story', 'characters', 'not', 'flashy', 'animation', 'history', 'war', 'too', 'many', 'other', 'war', 'movies', 'focal', 'point', 'show', ""n't"", 'characters', 'war', 'film', 'however', 'two', 'children', 'are', 'definitely', 'main', 'characters', 'many', 'American', 'animated', 'films', 'animation', ""n't"", 'main', 'attraction', 'either', 'art', 'beautifully', 'simplistic', 'elegant', 'shares', 'same', 'style', 'Princess', 'Mononoke', 'Kiki', 'Delivery', 'Service', 'Castle', 'Sky', 'Spirited', 'Away', 'films', 'shared', 'same', 'director', 'Grave', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'films', 'still', 'think', 'GotF', 'best', 'them.I', 'cry', 'movies', ""'ll"", 'admit', 'movies', 'lose', 'emotional', 'impact', 'first', 'time', 'only', 'so', 'many', 'times', 'can', 'get', 'misty-eyed', 'what', ""'ve"", 'already', 'seen', 'Grave', 'Fireflies', 'rule', 'not', 'just', 'many', 'people', 'interview', 'bonus', 'disc', 'Ebert', 'being', 'moved', 'nearly', 'tears', 'watching', 'film', 'Even', 'been', 'well', 'decade', 'first', 'watched', 'film', 'never', 'move', 'tears', 'What', 'so', 'amazing', 'film', 'heartbreak', ""n't"", 'intentional', 'just', 'what', 'when', 'two', 'children', 'pay', 'price', 'war', 'plot', 'mechanism', 'emotions', 'need', 'gimmicks.With', 'films', 'get', 'feeling', 'only', 'reason', 'certain', 'bits', 'were', 'added', 'was', 'filmmakers', 'wanted', 'tug', 'heartstrings', 'intentionally', 'Perhaps', 'what', 'film', 'so', 'poignant', 'just', 'going', 'story', 'not', 'purposefully', 'trying', 'be', 'sad', 'very', 'honest', 'simplistic', 'elegant', 'film', 'huge', 'emotional', 'impact', 'viewers', 'easily', 'not', 'just', 'best', 'anime', 'film', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'seen', 'one', 'best', 'movies', 'period', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'had', 'pleasure', 'watching']",N/A

I think that as a creator, this is the greatest achievement one can reach, and I have the utmost respect and admiration for anyone who accomplishes this very thing which I so eagerly wish to achieve.""Grave of the Fireflies"" is the sad tale, based on the semi-autographical book ""Hotaru no Haka"" by NOSAKA Akiyuki, which tells of the author's experiences during the aftermath of World War II, in which he lost his little sister to malnutrition, for which he blamed himself.In ""Grave of the Fireflies,"" 14 year old Seita and his 4 year old sister Setsuko lose their mother after the Allied forces bomb their village. Their father is in the Navy and at sea, and hasn't been heard from in a long while. Without going through the entire plot, suffice it to say that the story is a moving and frightening look back at the lives of two young children who should never have to face such horrors at their tender ages. The tone and mood of this heartwrenching piece is set from the very first scene, when Seita utters the fateful words ""September 21st, 1945. That's the day that I died.""Before watching ""Grave of the Fireflies"" I'd heard that it'd been referred to by many, like movie reviewer Roger Ebert, as one of the greatest war films made, and after watching it, I have to agree. Only a person with the emotional depth of a gnat or the heart of block of wood could watch this film and not feel the emotional power of it. It's the kind of story that lingers in your consciousness long after, and forces you to see the true face of war, the REAL consequences and victims of the violence we seem all too quick to inflict upon each other these days. And the most incredible thing about this movie is its subtleness, its complete lack of political propaganda or any attempt to try to blantantly force a moralistic ideal down the viewers throat. Director Isao Takahata shows supreme trust in the story itself, choosing to use the beautifully illustrated film to portray the tale in all its moving glory.In Japan this movie was shown in schools as an educational piece. I don't know if this has been done in America, but I think that it should. We need to learn to understand the entire spectrum of war, and on an even more basic level, we just need to teach our children the lessons of empathy and compassion so that when they find themselves in positions in which their decisions impact others, they'll take care to consider the consequences before making those decisions. I also think that every world leader should be forced to sit down and watch this film over and over until its message is ingrained into the nooks and crannies of their brains, because it often seems that compassion and empathy are qualities sadly lacking these days.",5,Grave of the Fireflies.

It will indeed make you cry.  I cried when I first saw it.But here's the big problem, in a nutshell.  This movie is also part and parcel of a continuing culture of denial and coverup by the Japanese about their war atrocities both before and during World War II.  The Japanese, completely unlike the Germans, were never made to fully repay their moral debt to the world, and were never made to fully apologize and atone for or even to admit their atrocities.And so to this day, the Japanese memory of their role in WWII is reflected only in movies such as this one - that the only thing of importance that happened in WWII was that the Japanese  suffered terribly, and that therefore, all war is terrible, and by association, all nations who wage war are terrible (and that of course includes the Americans, who are the only ones depicted killing people here in this movie).China and Korea to this day maintain as part of their national cultures this intense anger at these now 60+ year old Japanese atrocities.  But why shouldn't they?  Japan, like Turkey with the Armenians, has never fully admitted or apologized for the crimes committed against those peoples.  The Prime Minister of Japan continues to honor the few hanged war criminals of Japan by annually visiting their graves (it was part of his campaign promise to the right wing nationalists of Japan, who are indeed on the rise).  I say ""few"" hanged war criminals, because Japan was not fully occupied for months after surrender, and so the war criminals had time to destroy almost all of the incriminating documents and evidence.  Only the biggest names of the Japanese war criminals were ever tried, with almost all of the middle level and small fry escaping.  The onset of the Korean War, and the American need to turn Japan into a reliable ally put a final stop to further pursuit of Japanese war criminals.The level of ignorance exhibited about this continuing controversy by both the current generation of Japanese and the many Americans and Europeans who have posted in these five star reviews for this movie is just appalling.Let me just give you a frame of reference here  - suppose the Germans were to make a deeply sympathetic, sad, and beautiful cartoon movie, depicting the children of Nazi SS stormtroopers, or the children of Nazi concentration camp guards, one day playing happily in their home, and then getting horribly incinerated in a firebombing (e.g., at Hamburg, done by the British, by the way).  Can you just imagine the howling, the international protests?  Neither the Israelis and Russians, who both have much longer memories than Americans, would ever permit such a movie to be released.For all of you who were born yesterday (the five star reviewers of this movie) here's a very brief reading list:1. Rape of Nanking - Many Japanese still deny that this ever happened.2. Flyboys - the future President Bush almost ends up as teriyaki steak for cannibal Japanese soldiers during WWII.3. Superfortress - Curtis LeMay explains why he firebombed Japan.  The bottom line was that the fanatic military elite governing Japan was willing to sacrifice the entire civilian population if need be, in an American invasion.  LeMay figured that the only way to avoid this was to severely beat these fanatics into submission, and he figured that the sooner this happened, the fewer total numbers of dead people there would be.  The firebombing and atomic bombing in his estimation, saved more lives in the end.4. The White Rose - written by the sister of Sophie Scholl, a 21-year old German student who was executed for opposing Hitler and the Nazis.  There's also a movie by this name, made in Germany.In Germany today, there are many plaques honoring Sophie Scholl, and she is considered a national heroine.  Were there any Japanese who dared to stand up to the military fanatics during WWII?  Where are the plaques honoring those people?  Where are the Japanese writers and moviemakers who speak out against the evil of the military elite that governed Japan during WWII?The truth is that the very few Japanese who do dare speak out today come under intense criticism (and sometimes physical attacks) by the right wing nationalists of Japan.  The Japanese Prime Minister continues to honor the hanged war criminals.  And movies like ""Graveyard of the Fireflies"", as sad and true and beautiful as they are, are the only part of the history of WWII that the Japanese ever learn about, perpetuating the Japanese  view of themselves as co-equal victims of war, rather than as the instigators and perpetrators of war atrocities.The Germans were forced to fully come to terms with their past long ago, and have become much the better for it.  The Japanese need to learn from the Germans.",1,Sad movie - and I mean the continuing Japanese denial of WWII atrocities,1144540800,"04 9, 2006",2006,4934,"['[', ']', 'Taken', 'just', 'movie',

If you have even a shred of a soul you will be moved to tears, but this movie will do more that that.  You will be a different person after you watch it.  Many movies are sad, but Grave of the Fireflies finds that part of you where hope and despair meet, and lays it waste.  Watching the innocent slide inexorably to their doom is hard, but there is more to it than that. One child is dead when the movie opens, and another soon dies in a railway station.  The cleaning crew dispose of his belongings, including a small tin box that once contained candy.  When the story finally ends, the memory of that earlier scene will haunt you for a long time.There is a power in the simplicity of this animated film that a live-action movie could never achieve.  There is hardly any graphic violence.  Many scenes are languid and beautiful, and some are heartwarming, which makes the ultimate heartbreak all the more devastating.  You may want to watch this film alone.It is essential to see it with the original Japanese soundtrack and English subtitles.

This was made in '88 from the semi-biographical short story by Akiyuki Nosaka based on his personal experiences after the firebombing of Kobe, Japan during WW2. It doesn't really mention the Americans or the Japanese imperial govt much at all and only in passing, as they are there, but in the deep background as most people on the ground during a war find their situation, and that is what this film deals with, the survivors of the wars that others carry out around them. It was used as a means to get the Ghibli classic My Neighbor Totoro idea made into a film. Weird to think of them paired together, but the artist touch and feel of the crew are definitely there. The story is semibiographical because the author tried to create it within the designs of the mythic instead of the reality of his own situation. I would suggest reading all the many excellent reviews by students of film including Roger Ebert. In '87, the year the started making this film, the director who himself was a survivor and the author sat down for an interview that would put the film in a better understood light: [...]Just imagine the girl is only 16 months instead of nearly 4 years old and you will understand the situation better that the author speaks of, as well as how naive he was if you've ever understood the propaganda empires live under and teach their young, same as we here in the States do now... and very few even realize it unless they get their 'news' offshore. The boy just doesn't know like most people now. Obviously, in real life the boy lived, but in that interview with the director, the need for atonement is crafted by the director in the ghost figures of the pair that wasn't in the short story. This is a work of atonement, easy to make in the brain, hard to make in the heart. Painful to watch by the end, same as watching the inevitable conclusions of most peoples lives around you as everyone but themselves can see what's coming.As most reviewers state, this story could not be made in live action and make it believable as can be done in animation. This anime film is really in a category all by itself. Simply heartbreaking, but that is how new muscle is formed if the experience makes us learn our lessons.

Beginning with Nausicaa of the Valley of the Wind and continuing with Laputa: Castle in the Sky, I knew that Grave of the Fireflies was not going to be a fantasy. And while I taught East Asian History and have read primary sources on the experiences of the Japanese at the end of WWII, I was not emotionally prepared for this film. I couldn't watch it straight through. I had to set it aside and return to it.That is not to say this is a bad film. Quite the opposite. It's an extraordinary film. Set against the backdrop of the end of WWII in Japan, we are taken on the journey of two children, Setsuko and Seita. We see through their eyes how they lived and coped with the firebombing of Japanese cities, we witness their emotional and physical displacement, but we also witness war from the point of view of children. I kept recalling Spielberg's Empire of the Sun for some reason. Another story about a child during WWII.I have now watched 9 of 20 Studio Ghibli films, and this is my third review on Amazon (more to come - My Neighbor Totoro next). Knowing that the story is based on the wartime experiences of a real Japanese man who lost his sister makes this all the more powerful. If you're interested in Studio Ghibli films, then this is a film to see. It doesn't have the fantastical elements that other SG films possess.

183226,A3080YC6R9G303,156219464X,Greg Robertson,"[4, 6]","It's been many years since I've seen a movie that combines the innocence of childhood with the cruelty of war as well as ""Grave of the Fireflies"" does.  Yes, this is animation -- anime, to be specific -- not live action, but in many ways the story is stronger because it doesn't show real people.  For example, it's easy to laugh and smile with the little girl when she is jumping among the fireflies, but because it is animation, it's harder to tell how bad certain issues have built up later in the film, until it suddenly hits you.  It's very powerful.It also helps, I think, that the story takes place in World War II Japan, instead of today, although the message is relevant to any time period.  By making it something of a period piece, Tatsumi diminishes some of the tendency to point fingers, but not  the pain that viewers SHOULD feel.  It also helps that the quality of the drawings and animation are terriific throughout the piece, and among the best anime drawing I've seen.I will say that the story, despite trying to start off with a very powerful moment, actually takes a little while to get going.  Once it does, though, it keeps you wondering what's going to happen next in frame after frame.  Worth noting, too, is that I can't recommend this for younger children.  It may be a cartoon, but that doesn't mean it's for children.The DVD is also quite good, in that it has a lot of extra material, including talks by the director, Roger Ebert, and others who add to the richness of the childrens' story. It does have a few too many previews of other anime ""movies,"" but it's easy enough to get past them.At first, I ended this review by saying that I hope you enjoy the movie.  On reflection, though, this film makes such a strong comment on humanity and war that perhaps the word ""enjoy"" goes too far.  I do hope you feel enriched by it, though.

What is not known to American audiences is the presence of another amazing director, Isao Takahata.  His works tend to be more Japanese than Miyazaki's, and a bit more realistic with less fantasy qualities to them- probably the reason his works are not as known as Miyazaki's.  Fortunately, Grave of the Fireflies is available to American audience by both VHS and DVD.Grave of the Fireflies will make its viewers that an animation can really touch the audience in a special way.  The tragedy the two orphans go through in a war-torn Japan is powerful enough to bring tears to the grown-ups.  What makes the story even more moving is the beautiful setting the film takes place, as if asking do those kids really belong in this tragedy.  I believe it is one of the best works by Takahata, and had received honors from many animation festivals across the world.  I find the story may be a bit too heavy for children- more suitable to older kids and adults, due to the gravity of the situation; this film has no gratuitous violence or even a hint of nudity whatsoever.If you are open to animations that are not necessarily from Walt Disney, I recommend that you must see this film.

He was the one that introduced me to Cowboy Bebop, Eva, Escaflowne, Noir, Vampire Hunter D, and a few other gems.So he decided to run this one by me and see if I liked it.Yes, yes I did.  A lot.  It's not your average, fun-loving flick, though. It's about war-time Japan during WW2 and how the fighting disturbed the lives of the non-soldiers. The 2 main characters are children and they are left abandoned thanks to American bombing raids. They struggle through the whole movie just to stay alive and have the basic human necessities. It's sad, and wonderful and well-presented.So what's with the ""BUT"" in my title line? To be honest, it's the little boy. Without giving away the ending, it was one of those things that he could have done something about his situation a lot sooner, and he doesn't.

This is an extremely poignant story meticulously crafted to achieve maximum impact and what an impact it is. There are scenes that will undoubtedly burn themselves into your memory to haunt you for the next few days, weeks...maybe even years.Every aspect of this film has been skillfully and artfully placed to help reach its level of universal power. The art and animation are simply gorgeous, capable of portraying sunny countryside and burned-down village alike in a style highly reminiscent of Studio Ghibli. You can almost taste the salt in the air at the seashore, smell the ash as the village burns down. Simple orchestral melodies sprinkled throughout enhance the viewing experience even further, resulting in an engrossing experience only rivaled by actually visiting these locales yourself.Of course, there's more to Grave of the Fireflies than great cinematography much more. Grave features an all-too-believable story that will tear at anyone who calls him/herself human. Rather than resort to preaching to bring its anti-war message across, this film simply presents its evidence to you in all of its tragedy. Innocent Setsuko and intrepid Seita are two children that you'll swear you've met before, and watching them suffer through the aftermath of the fire-bombing will break your heart. Knowing their eventual fate beforehand does nothing to diminish the effectiveness of the story; in fact, it only intensifies the reality of each scene. The beginning unfolds evocatively, and the end closes by bringing the story full-circle, leaving viewers with more questions than answers as they wipe the tears from their eyes.For the record: yes, it is_ possible to see this movie through without shedding a tear, but you'd have to be one cynical and jaded fellow.

Everyone I know who has seen this movie has been moved totally by this movie. From Roger Ebert himself to Casey Mines of Movie Review Planet, this movie has been deemed &quot;seamless&quot;. Ebert gave it a 4/4, and Mines gave it a 10/10.Why does this movie work? The plot is quite simple-and yet perfect. (or as close to perfect as possible.) I'll try to explain this. In its simplicity, it moves you. It does not have to go through plot twist after plot twist like Memento to stun you. No, rather it uses this simple plot and quietly, and with the utmost patience reduces you to tears. While it is simple just by itself, this plot can also be seen as a very complicated one. One could see it as an examination of human nature and the will to survive. In many precious moments, we see human instinct bared out for all to see. Something we usually find simple, suddenly becomes a whole lot more meaningful in the context of the movie. We can see from this example that a movie does not have to go to great lengths to be perfect.Stunning and beautiful animation add to this movie. With golden-brown hues used throughout much of the movie, the cinematography enhances the experience by that much more. The animation actually enhances this movie. Like others have said, this movie could not have been done as well if it was not animated. The animation helps you capture those precious moments, and the expressions the characters use. The feelings show on their faces so well, love, anger, sadness, longing, pain...they are all there.A very quiet movie. This silence that is consistent throughout the whole movie also makes this more an experience, and not just a movie. The silence gives it that gritty reality that many movies search for--and yet, it is this, an animated movie that succeeds in creating that atmosphere. This silence helps get rid of the characters facades and masks away so that what we see is the raw and true emotions in their eyes. And it moves slowly but surely. Like the boy and his sister struggling to survive, this movie slowly, bit by bit, strips away their dignity, until they are reduced to living like animals. And yet, they still manage to retain their sense of beauty and their struggle to survive. Even when things are bad, they can still see the beauty of life.They somehow are able to keep a tiny scrap of a tiny scrap of their original dignity, essence, and personality. They are together; that is all that matters, this keeps them alive everyday; this is their main struggle. Without one another, the will to survive would be gone.And so, this is what this movie is about. Keeping that tiny scrap of dignity, no matter how bad things seem, and no matter if you know the odds are against you. The beauty of life and the sense that life is always worth living is what drove them to try and survive.",5,An examination of the human nature...,1007510400,"12 5, 2001",2001,3042,"['Where', 'Memento', 'succeeded', 'stunning', 'totally', 'favourite', 'movie', 'Grave', 'Fireflies', 'totally', 'succeeded', 'making', 'feel', 'depressed', 'three', 'whole', 'days', 'very', 'close', '2nd', 'favourites', 'list', 'Everyone', 'know', 'who', 'seen', 'movie', 'been', 'moved', 'totally', 'movie', 'Roger', 'Ebert', 'Casey', 'Mines', 'Movie', 'Review', 'Planet', 'movie', 'been', 'deemed', 'quot', 'quot', 'Ebert', 'gave', '4/4', 'Mines', 'gave', '10/10.Why', 'movie', 'work', 'plot', 'quite', 'simple-and', 'yet', 'perfect', 'as', 'close', 'perfect', 'possible', ""'ll"", 'try', 'explain', 'simplicity', 'not', 'have', 'go', 'plot', 'twist', 'plot', 'twist', 'Memento', 'stun', 'No', 'rather', 'simple', 'plot', 'quietly', 'utmost', 'patience', 'reduces', 'tears', 'simple', 'just', 'plot', 'can', 'also', 'be', 'seen', 'very', 'complicated', 'one', 'One', 'could', 'see', 'examination', 'human', 'nature', 'will', 'survive', 'many', 'precious', 'moments', 'see', 'human', 'instinct', 'bared', 'out', 'see', 'Something', 'usually', 'find', 'simple', 'suddenly', 'whole', 'lot', 'more', 'meaningful', 'context', 'movie', 'can', 'see', 'example', 'movie', 'not', 'have', 'go', 'great', 'lengths', 'be', 'perfect.Stunning', 'beautiful', 'animation', 'add', 'movie', 'golden-brown', 'hues', 'used', 'much', 'movie', 'cinematography', 'experience', 'much', 'more', 'animation', 'actually', 'movie', 'others', 'have', 'said', 'movie', 'could', 'not', 'have', 'been', 'done', 'as', 'well', 'was', 'not', 'animated', 'animation', 'capture', 'precious', 'moments', 'expressions', 'characters', 'use', 'feelings', 'show', 'so', 'well', 'love', 'anger', 'sadness', 'longing', 'pain', 'are', 'there.A', 'very', 'quiet', 'movie', 'silence', 'consistent', 'whole', 'movie', 'also', 'more', 'experience', 'not', 'just', 'movie', 'silence', 'gritty', 'reality', 'many', 'movies', 'search', 'yet', 'animated', 'movie', 'creating', 'atmosphere', 'silence', 'get', 'rid', 'characters', 'facades', 'masks', 'away', 'so', 'what', 'see', 'raw', 'true', 'emotions', 'eyes', 'slowly', 'surely', 'boy', 'sister', 'struggling', 'survive', 'movie', 'slowly', 'bit', 'bit', 'away', 'dignity', 'are', 'reduced', 'living', 'animals', 'yet', 'still', 'manage', 'retain', 'sense', 'beauty', 'struggle', 'survive', 'Even', 'when', 'things', 'are', 'bad', 'can', 'still', 'see', 'beauty', 'life.They', 'somehow', 'are', 'able', 'keep', 'tiny', 'scrap', 'tiny', 'scrap', 'original', 'dignity', 'essence', 'personality', 'are', 'together', 'matters', 'alive', 'everyday', 'main', 'struggle', 'one', 'will', 'survive', 'would', 'be', 'gone.And', 'so', 'what', 'movie', 'about', 'Keeping', 'tiny', 'scrap', 'dignity', 'matter', 'how', 'bad', 'things', 'seem', 'matter', 'know', 'odds', 'are', 'beauty', 'life', 'sense', 'life', 'always', 'worth', 'living', 'what', 'drove', 'try', 'survive']",N/A

While Disney has mastered the musical comedy format (though there's always room for improvement) they have failed to take the medium any further in story structure and themes.  Anime has been exploring the many possibilities of animation for years.  Like &quot;Princess Mononoke&quot; and &quot;Ghost In The Shell&quot;, 'Fireflies' is a triumphant reward of such bold experimentation. 'Fireflies' tells the story of two children orphaned by World War II bombings.  Their struggles to survive in desperate times is both moving and captivating.  The film gracefully shows how tragedy and slef-preservation can bring out both the best and worst in people.  There is no hard lesson to learn here, no spoon-fed moral.  This is just a sad story story brought to life through a medium that has yet to fulfill it's potential.  Older kids may be entertained by this somber story but you may want to avoid this one for the very young.  This isn't &quot;My Neghbor Totoro&quot;.

A young man and his little sister are orphaned during a U.S. bombing of their home town. Their mother is killed and their father is in the Navy. They go to live with a relative, but she quickly begins to feel they are ungrateful. We see the siblings slowly starve to death throughout the film. They have a wonderful relationship, but the lack of the ability to acquire food slowly drains them of life as the older brother tries more and more to get food for his sister. This is a very sad movie to watch, but it is simply excellent. One of the best movies of any year.In the past, when I have thought of an anime movie, I thought of a story that borders on the fantastic. Perhaps with futuristic or magical settings.

Thiel""","[14, 15]","Besides what all, including myself, write about the powerful message and meaning of this film, it should also be made clear that this is a great film--period.  Not just a great anime, or a great work of ""Asian cinema"" or Japanese cinema.  This is a film which anyone who loves fine movie-making will be glad to not have missed and is worthy of anyone's very elite collection if they have one.My review would not change if this were a film using live actors, though it would take an entire cast and crew with superhuman filmmaking abilities to even remotely match the power of this film.  Frankly, this could not be done with live actors; you would need every single person working on the film to have suffered war themselves, as non-combatants, in order to capture the genuine anguish expressed by the characters here.  The faces of the characters are clearly those of the principle animator, conveying an experience in a way that is not embellished or dramatized for an attempt at greater effect.There are times when you will look into the eyes of these anime characters and see the intensity of emotion and experience that you would only expect could be seen in the eyes of a refugee of ethnic cleansing or, in the case of Japan, children who were surrounded by the decimation of everything that was good and secure about their lives prior to war--and yet are still children with normal curiousities, needs, and instincts.Having lived in Japan for nearly a decade myself, and talked to many who were children during and at the end of the war, I can say that there's no dissimilarity between the personal stories I've heard and those of the characters in the film.  And since it is rare for an American to have the experience or patience to sit and listen to someone who has had such an experience, I recommend this film most highly to serve the purpose.No one who sees this film and understands that it is not a dramatization or embelleshment should fail to get the message--that this is not about special, Japanese children, but about all children displaced by war, and that it is as true of kids in Yugoslavia or Somalia or Iraq today as it was of Japan back then.",5,"A powerful film, particularly appropriate for generations lucky enough to never have experienced war first hand.",1159228800,"09 26, 2006",2006,2168,"['what', 'including', 'write', 'powerful', 'message', 'meaning', 'film', 'should', 'also', 'be', 'made', 'clear', 'great', 'film', 'period', 'Not', 'just', 'great', 'anime', 'great', 'work', 'Asian', 'cinema', 'Japanese', 'cinema', 'film', 'anyone', 'who', 'fine', 'movie-making', 'will', 'be', 'glad', 'not', 'have', 'missed', 'worthy', 'anyone', 'very', 'elite', 'collection', 'have', 'one.My', 'review', 'would', 'not', 'change', 'were', 'film', 'using', 'live', 'actors', 'would', 'take', 'entire', 'cast', 'crew', 'superhuman', 'filmmaking', 'abilities', 'even', 'remotely', 'match', 'power', 'film', 'Frankly', 'could', 'not', 'be', 'done', 'live', 'actors', 'would', 'need', 'single', 'person', 'working', 'film', 'have', 'suffered', 'war', 'non-combatants', 'order', 'capture', 'genuine', 'anguish', 'expressed', 'characters', 'here', 'characters', 'are', 'clearly', 'principle', 'animator', 'conveying', 'experience', 'way', 'not', 'embellished', 'dramatized', 'attempt', 'greater', 'are', 'times', 'when', 'will', 'look', 'eyes', 'anime', 'characters', 'see', 'intensity', 'emotion', 'experience', 'would', 'only', 'expect', 'could', 'be', 'seen', 'eyes', 'refugee', 'ethnic', 'cleansing', 'case', 'Japan', 'children', 'who', 'were', 'surrounded', 'decimation', 'everything', 'was', 'good', 'secure', 'lives', 'prior', 'war', 'yet', 'are', 'still', 'children', 'normal', 'curiousities', 'needs', 'instincts.Having', 'lived', 'Japan', 'nearly', 'decade', 'myself', 'talked', 'many', 'who', 'were', 'children', 'end', 'war', 'can', 'say', 'dissimilarity', 'personal', 'stories', ""'ve"", 'heard', 'characters', 'film', 'rare', 'American', 'have', 'experience', 'patience', 'sit', 'listen', 'someone', 'who', 'had', 'such', 'experience', 'recommend', 'film', 'most', 'highly', 'serve', 'purpose.No', 'one', 'who', 'film', 'not', 'dramatization', 'embelleshment', 'should', 'fail', 'get', 'message', 'not', 'special', 'Japanese', 'children', 'children', 'displaced', 'war', 'true', 'kids', 'Yugoslavia', 'Somalia', 'Iraq', 'today', 'was', 'Japan', 'back', 'then']",N/A
183249,A3F9VH8916IA40,156219464X,Jonathan &#34;Jimmy Dean&#34; Lane: libertari...,"[8, 8]","Few movies I've seen can bring me to the brink of tears, and only a handful of those can actually haunt me days after seeing them. Grave of the Fireflies is one of those rare movies I've seen that did this to me. Very few films have EVER made me feel as bad as this one did. Try to think of the saddest movie you've ever seen,Schindler's List (Widescreen Edition),Saving Private Ryan (Widescreen Two-Disc Special Edition), anything, and this movie blows it out of the water. This film has the power to devastate you, to move you, to bring you to the brink of tears and then push you over into a chaotic world. This is Grave of the Fireflies.Set during the last days of WWII, while the US Air Force was fire bombing Japanese cities, Grave of the Fireflies is a movie about a young boy named Sata and his little four year old sister Setsico. When their mother is killed in the firebombing of Tokyo Sata is forced to care for his little sister in a nation ripped apart by war and famine. With his father far away serving in the Japanese navy, Sata is the only one who can care for his sister. The love shared between these two siblings is something that will forever leave an impression on me. As an older brother myself I could very easily put myself into Sata's situation. His need to give his sister the very best he can while not being able to provide for her is a very real feeling.There are no heroes in this film, and there are no villains. Sata and Setsico are no heroes; the only heroic things they do throughout the movie are love and take care of one another. And, their aunt, although harsh and unfair, is no villain. At the same time neither side of the war, American or Japanese, is portrayed in a negative light. This is not a war movie and doesn't exist to condemn one side or the other. This is a movie about two orphan children trying to survive while the society they grew up in crumbles to dust around them.Many critics of this movie complain about how annoying little Setsico is. Yes, I can admit, sometimes Setsico can be annoying, but really, what little girl isn't? She's a child, and children can't understand everything that's going on around them.

183250,A2AS6AGSSXR1J9,156219464X,"Jonathan J. Kim ""Tinker""","[12, 113]","1. This is not a childrens' Anime just like most Japanese Anime. This is not Disney/Pixar. Most Japanese Anime are darker than any Watchmen or anything American ever was and will.2. As with most Japanese Anime, it contains extreme propaganda agenda of the creator. Unfortunately this anime is about Victimization of Japan during WW2 by American aggressors.I am shocked and horrified by the Anime which is very widely embraced and praised. Ever so lovely Setsuko who seem to be around 4-5 year of age is constantly begging for viewer's attention and love. And she is a lovely baby girl. Pure and innocent, obvious victim of nuclear bomb whose body is fading away but her spirit is high with love and attention from Seita who is also dying from American nuclear bomb.Amazon's Editorial Reviews claims that the ""strength of Grave of the Fireflies lies in ** doctor, ** aunt, ** cousins"" That's simply not the case if you see the it. Anime is from the start to the end begging for sympathy for Victimized Japanese of WW2 who suffered terrible tragedy through air raids and nuclear bomb dropped by evil American Empire. It starts out with the bomb, and every few minutes you are reminded through air raid sound and scene why Setsuko is suffering. The whole movie is about 2 most innocent Japanese victims through the hands of American nuclear bomb and how it should not be repeated. Sadly, for every Setsuko there were 100 if not 1000 other Asians girls who went through bigger tragedy. And this movie wasn't about Japan's imperial ambition which brought such tragedy by one nation to whole of Asia. It isn't about how Japanese should recognize what they did to cause 1000s of Setsuko around Asia and even in US through their dead GI dads. This is solely about how ""innocent"" Japan was victimized by nuclear bomb carrying evil Americans.If you have watch the whole movie and didn't understand its powerful propaganda I don't know what to say. What if the boy was German boy near a factory in Dresden, would you have caught what it was trying to say?I guess it comes down to a question of whether propaganda is an art or not. Or maybe people enjoy well made propaganda as much as any other type of art. Even if it was saying Japan the rapist, murderer of millions were the 4 year old victim of WW2 by Mighty American nuclear bomb. Will you teach your kid that lesson?--All propaganda has to be popular and has to adapt its spiritual level to the perception of the least intelligent of those towards whom it intends to direct itself.-A.

183251,AUS2EQT4NU3BF,156219464X,"Jonathon Turner ""Jon Turner""","[14, 15]","Truly one of Studio Ghibli's greatest crowning achievements, GRAVE OF THE FIREFLIES is a brilliant masterpiece fully deserving of a place in any of the best movies ever made. Not just an astonishingly great (and, at the risk of coming off as clich&eacute;, perfect) work of art, this is a moving, thought-provoking, and ultimately heartbreaking tale about the loss of innocence and the tragedies of war.Based on an autobiography by Akiyuki Nosaka, the film, set during the bombing of Japan in --of all times-- World War II, centers on Seita, a loving, headstrong Navy soldier's son and his innocent little sister, Setsuko. Their fatal struggle for survival begins right at the start, when both are bombed out of house and home by American B-29s. Mom is seriously wounded and found wrapped in bandages at a hospital, where she dies shortly after. The children move to Nishinomiya to stay with their aunt. Auntie, a cold, bitter, self-serving woman, has no patience with Seita or Setsuko, especially when they would rather chase after fireflies at moonlight, play by the beach, or lounge around the house instead of helping out. After butting heads with Auntie long enough, the children decide to run away, setting up home in an abandoned cave by the lake. Both try by all means to live off of vegetables or whatever food they can afford to trade and/or steal, to no avail....The outcome of the story is actually showcased at the opening of the movie, where we see a ghostly specter of Seita watching a more malnourished version of himself die a painful, lonely death at a train station. Indeed, as we see how these events came to pass, we find ourselves rooting for Seita and Setsuko to find a way to stay alive, but alas, it is not to be, given Seita's stubborn pride. The overall tone of the movie is of a very tragic nature--even such lighthearted moments as the aforementioned sequences involving Seita and Setsuko playing around the house or gathering fireflies as lights for their cave are all tainted with a touch of sadness, for we know that these brief scenes of happiness will not last.Who is to blame for the plight of these children? The movie never addresses this question to the audience, nor does it really care to. It would be easy for director Isao Takahata to make this an anti-American movie, but he does better than that. Instead, he aptly conveys that war can spell serious--and deadly--consequences for victims. He also eschews casting any character as a hero or villain, and instead makes this a very human story, with no clear-cut ""good"" or ""bad"" characters.  The aunt, for example, is not evil; she is merely an angry, desperate woman who is only struggling to survive just as much as Seita and Setsuko are. Atrocious as her treatment of the children is, we somehow never see her as a true baddie, but a very flawed, multi-faceted human being.Normally one would think of this kind of story as suitable for live-action, but GRAVE OF THE FIREFLIES proves that it can be told through the art of animation as well. This is no mindless showcase of gorgeous visuals--although the artistic merits of the movie are, as with Ghibli productions, sumptuous and at times breathtaking--but a display of real characters struggling with very tangible emotions. And the most amazing accomplishment about this movie is how much we grow to care for Seita and Setsuko--their inseparable bond of love and companionship is the heart and soul behind the movie.There are long stretches of silence on the soundtrack, with music used very sparingly, yet the movie is all the more powerful for it. The most effective moment is where we hear a scratchy rendition of ""Home, Sweet Home"" over a montage of Setsuko playing by the shelter. It's a simplistic, sweet, yet very saddening moment that not only works in the context of the movie, but on its own as well.While Disney has released most of Studio Ghibli's other works in the United States, GRAVE OF THE FIREFLIES is currently available as a 2-Disk Collector's Set from New York based Anime publisher Central Park Media. Presented in an all-new anamorphic transfer, the video quality was apparently remastered, with very pleasing results.  Where this set excels, though, is in the amount of extras.  In addition to documentaries about the bombing of Japan and the production, we get interviews with Isao Takahata, Akiyuki Nosaka, and even longtime film critic Roger Ebert.  Even if you don't read critical reviews, you should check out what he has to say about GRAVE OF THE FIREFLIES.  His words may surprise you.I don't normally say this in my reviews, but I would definitely recommend watching this movie in its native language of Japanese for a truly powerful and memorable experience.  That's not to imply, however, that the English dub is inferior; on the contrary.  It is, in fact, surprisingly good, with an effective lead in J. Robert Spencer and noteworthy cameo appearances by Anime voiceover actors Veronica Taylor, Crispin Freeman, and Dan Green. Rhoda Chrosite's Setsuko is the one voice that doesn't fare so well; she sounds more like an adult pretending to be a young girl, and comes across as strained during most scenes (save for when she is sick from diarrhea).  Still, for those who can't read subtitles, the dub is more than adequate (although not as high-profile as others that I've heard).Even in a genre as multi-faceted as Japanese Anime, there are few films that literally everyone really MUST see.  GRAVE OF THE FIREFLIES is one such movie.",5,"Heartrendering, moving masterpiece from Isao Takahata, and a triumph for animation.",1124323200,"08 18, 2005",2005,5515,"['Truly', 'one', 'Studio',

Arethere any four-year-old child actresses out there who could accuratelyplay the role of Setsuko?  But the choice to use animation has,however, had a negative effect-- for the most part, the only Americanviewers who end up discovering this masterpiece are anime fans, whomay be disappointed by the lack of giant robots and slimy demonrapists.

Sherman ""The Critic""","[3, 3]","Movies with an anti-war message are nothing new to Studio Ghibli, churning out such animated films as ""Nausicaa"" and ""Princess Mononoke.""  This widely acclaimed entry is no different, except that it's added to the long list of WWII-related media.  It focuses on Japan but not on the ""aggressors"" of the war.  On the contrary, it's all about the civilians.Losing their mother in an air raid, young Seita and his little sister Setsuko move in with an aunt who doesn't hide her resentment for the two.  Realizing they're not wanted, Seita and Setsuko leave to fend for themselves.  When the kids find refuge in a cave, all is well at first.  But as time passes and their food supply disappears, Seita and Setsuko find themselves in a struggle to stay a step ahead of starvation.  The viewer is then forced to watch the kids, alone and beyond help, as their ordeal goes on to the bitter end.While it seems that the kids get themselves in trouble by choosing pride over reason, that's far from the point of this film.  It not only lets the viewer see the war from the other side, but takes a look into the hardships endured by the Japanese in those days.  With food either being scarce, overpriced, or rationed everywhere (and with some areas being constantly attacked by enemy forces), getting by wasn't as easy as getting a job.

183263,A3NVN6RBBBQ0JQ,156219464X,Kevin Pazyck,"[8, 8]","Was this actually made in 1988?! It's understandable for one to mistake GRAVE OF THE FIREFLIES as contemporary 'anime' (Sailor Moon, Gundam, etc.) with a quick glance  at the cover. Nothing, absolutely nothing, could be farther from the truth. Normally, the medium deals with fantastic or non-realistic issues and stories. GOTF is a sobering story of two young Japanese children whose lives are shook to its foundations when 20th Century warfare impedes whatever hapiness and comfort they might've known.It's evident right from the start that it's not going to be a happy ending which lets the viewer focus on the journey to that black conclusion. Seita, a fifteen year old patriot, is forced very early on to grow up quick and take care of his very young sister Setsuko when a series of unfortunate events claim their parents. Ever present is the backdrop of the enemy (never mentioned who it is) and the constant barrage of air raids and bombs. In the forefront is Seita's drive to maturation and desperation for survival for him and Setsuko.While the story is straightforward and compelling, it is the attention to detail that really set the movie apart. For an animated feature, the 'acting' is leagues better than most live-action movies being spewed out of Hollywood lately. In addition, if you listen to the Japanese language track, the voice acting is flawless. Visually, there is much to see and you may come to appreciate a lot of little subtleties that would've been too easy for the creators to dismiss as unnecessary.The DVD is a two-disc set. The first is the main feature complete with the standard menu options. The second disc is a generous choice (compared to the usual content of anime releases) of interviews and discussions on the matter of the film. A class package through and through.It's important not to find blame or any political agenda. It would be missing the point. The motivation of this movie to me is the harsh realities endured by blameless civilians when armies go to war. It is not a feel-good film but a must-see by all means.

183264,AO461REE0KA4J,156219464X,keviny01,"[16, 18]","This remarkable Japanese animated film has been compared to the likes of SCHINDLER'S LIST, although it is probably more apt to compare it to the great 1952 live-action French film THE FORBIDDEN GAMES, which is also a war-time tragedy involving a small girl and her older male companion.  Both FORBIDDEN GAMES and GRAVE OF THE FIREFLIES use the same approach to convey an anti-war message: rather than depicting the violent atrocities of war (GRAVE is only rated PG), they depict the wounded souls of children as a result of war.  Both films use the theme of a little girl forming a &quot;bond&quot; with little animals as sort of an anchor for the plot.  Both films also show, in no uncertain terms, the adults' lack of understanding towards the children's emotional crisis, thus making their predicaments all the more tragic.But GRAVE stands out, as Roger Ebert points out in his interview segment on the 2-disc DVD, because it is an animated film.  A film like GRAVE repudiates the conventional belief that a cartoon cannot convey the same emotional impact as a live-action film.  In fact, says Ebert, it is precisely the fact that it is DRAWN that a cartoon can often impact the viewers in ways a live-action film can't.The new 2-disc DVD set from Central Park Media (which also made the 1-disc DVD version in 1998) has an improved picture quality compared to the overly brown and yellow transfer of the old DVD.  It looks cleaner and less grainy than the old transfer.  Colors look much better; sand on a beach actually looks like sand instead of mustard.  And flesh tones are more realistic.  But what I find lacking is sharpness.  The picture still looks a bit too soft for my liking.  The supplement has a segment on the video transfer process, and it shows a technician applying edge enhancement to the print to increase its sharpness.  Obviously, it didn't quite help.  The source material being used for the transfer was probably not very pristine to begin with.  The new transfer also looks a bit darker than the old one, dangerously obscuring some details in darker scenes (and there are quite a few dark scenes in the film).  The new print, however, shows more picture on the left and right sides of the screen.The supplements are excellent.  Roger Ebert has been a champion for the film's cause, and in his 12-minute interview segment, his enthusiasm for the film is contagious and his insights regarding the animated film genre enlightening.  There is a 18-minute interview of the film's director, Isao Takahata, who recounts the process of making the film (an actual five-year-old girl was hired to dub the voice of Setsuko, for instance).  There is a 6-minute making-of segment which includes an interview of Akiyuki Nosaka, the author of the novel on which the film was based.  The novel was, in turn, based on the author's own experience during the war.  In a 12-minute interview segment, two historians give compelling accounts on the historical settings pertaining to the film.  To gain more historical perspectives, don't miss the section in the supplements that compares photographs of actual locations to the scenes in the film that depict them.The most generous supplement inclusions are the film's complete screenplay and storyboards.  The screenplay, in English, is accessible via DVD-ROM, in both PC and Mac versions.  It is apparently not a shooting script (one that was written before a film was made), but a &quot;transcript&quot; of the finished film (written AFTER the film was made as a record).  Therefore, it matches the film exactly, and it doesn't contain any deleted scenes or altered dialogs that often make for fascinating reading.  Still, it is worthwhile for those who study screenwriting and those who, like me, are fascinated by how the written word is interpreted by the visual image.The storyboards are viewable by selecting an alternate &quot;angle&quot; on your DVD player, so you can switch back and forth between the film and the drawings.  All the storyboards are pencil drawings; some are sketchy, and some elaborate.  The  designs in these storyboards are quite close to those in the finished film, indicating these are probably final, fully conceptualized drawings.  I would have very much liked to see abandoned designs as well (such as the ones on the FANTASIA or SNOW WHITE DVDs, or the BEAUTY AND THE BEAST Work-in-progress version DVD).  That would have answered one of my questions: why does the little girl look a bit tomboyish?  The supplement section also has extra storyboards of deleted scenes.  Rounding out the extras are about 60 color stills (mostly cel reproductions, a few character designs and concept arts), trailers from other anime DVD releases, the original Japanese theatrical trailer for GRAVE.The new DVD is for region 1 only, while the old DVD is all-region.  The English and Japanese stereo tracks and the English subtitles are identical in content and quality on both DVDs.",4,Review of the 2-disc DVD remastered edition,1034121600,"10 9,

Now this digitally remastered and restored version will be able to reintroduce the film to a new generation.""Grave of the Fireflies"" is a film that I'd heard about for years before I finally got around to viewing it. As one of the most well-respected early anime classics--of course, I expected great things. I knew vaguely what the picture was about and knew that its tone strove for realism as opposed to fantasy. But what I didn't really comprehend is that it would be such a mature story geared toward adult audiences. The sophistication, complicated subject matter, and sorrow contained within ""Grave of the Fireflies"" made it one of the more surprisingly moving films that I'd seen in quite some time.The story is simplistic. Set in war-torn Japan near the end of the World War II, two kids must deal with the unexpected death of their mother in a bombing attack. With no one to care for them and their home destroyed, they attempt to live independently. Naturally, there are many obstacles to overcome, and the horrors of war are depicted with surprising candor. I had not expected the film to be so forthright in its depiction of such a serious subject matter.What really distinguishes ""Grave"" is that it becomes a powerful story of love and commitment. As the brother embraces the responsibility of caring for his much younger sister, we see him take the reins of adulthood.  It is a coming-of-age story by necessity. The relationship between the siblings is amazingly realistic and thoughtful. And even though the film is animated, it is perhaps one of the most stirring tales of familial loyalty that you can see. The plot unfolds in a heartbreaking way with moments of such tenderness, such love, and such inevitability. The film never condescends to its characters or its audience.Not a cheerful or easy film, ""Grave"" easily transcends most animated endeavors. The film has, through the years, reduced many of my friends to tears. For a realsitic anime film to elicit genuine and earned emotions, that's an enormous success. One note on the technical animation.  Keep in mind that the film was made in 1988, it's not going to be a glossy or polished Pixar film. Instead its appearance and style is appropriate for its timeframe and narrative.  But beyond the visuals, more importantly, the film is a powerful and relevant meditation on war and family.

They were in series of course and not only children but grown ups also enjoyed it and after every episode we couldnt wait for the next week. Marco, candy,heidi,vikings,maya the bee ,pinnochio,flying goose and countless others took us to the dream world. They were nothing like the super cyber Akira and the rest. They were very well designed and stories were brilliantly written. Most of these animes however were sad or had sad moments which were basicly about wars ,deaths,losses and separation. But mostly (not all of them) ending was optimistic and happy.In Japan unlike the west, animes are not only made for kids. I personally believe that grown ups especially youth adores them and they watch it on big screen.Grave of fireflies is an example of  pre Akira period anime.Yes it is a sad anime because firstly it is an anti war movie. Secondly you exactly know whats coming from the very early screens of the film. It is based on the last days of Japanese empire in ww2 when Japan was under bombardment of US planes. Our hero is a little kid who tries to help his little sister and survive in those days of hardship. Fire bombs rain on the city, food is very less,and accomodation is burnt and families are all shattered.His mother dies during a raid and high rank officer father never replies back from his ship of  the imperial navy. He remembers the pre war days and days of happiness and pride when they were together and how nation was strong.these are presented in wise falshbacks throughout the film. War time is presented with its all cold reality. Families are shattered, people are changed and become selfish, basic needs of life is hard to find.He buys, borrows and steals food for his little sister and for himself even dangering his life during air raids.When he brings his sister to the doctor, doctor says she needs nourishment not medicines. He shouts back ""where is the nourishment ?""As I mentioned, the flashbacks really work well, especially pouring huge rivers of emotion to the viewer when loved ones die. Director uses all the advantages af an anime and makes them as dramatic as it can be. People are represented as fireflies who drop and die so quickly and so young.They light the area that surround themselves for a while and after go off. Like a group of fireflies, they are put in mass graves together.During the film we never see anything from the front and battlefields. We only see the bombardments and the damage done to the civilians. Director shows here that home front is also no better than the frontlines and death is hiding in every corner, dressed in many ugly costumes. Director's way of painting this movie as an anti war film also make us to think about other nations  who suffered even greater pains during the war. Mothers,children,hunger,illness and death are all international issues of war and director manages to capture the conceptof an non pretentious anti war film very well. Actually Grave of fire flies with its all cold reality and human warmth , succeeds where most of the anti war movies fail. Maybe because of anime's freedom and limitations, maybe not.It is a very sad move so better prepare yourself before the film If you are calling yourself a hardened person (If you are going to watch it with a group) . Otherwise make sure to prepare some tissues.War does not kill only soldiers but also many fireflies.

It is not only the tragedy of the ending that is powerful (altho I admittedly spent the last 30 minutes blubbering uncontrollably) but the little happy moments as remembered by the dead narrator Seita, that shine with an honesty &amp; humanity rarely seen in film.There simply isn't a cliche in this movie. Seita &amp; his sister Setsuko are not your typical cute film kids; the world they inhabit was once a very real one albeit now long gone. The little moments are what shine especially, such as when Seita tries to pick out the melody to a nursery rhyme on his Aunt's organ to distract Setsuko from hunger, or when they go to the beach &amp; Seita plays a chase game thru the waves with his sister to the wonderment of onlooking salt workers. Setsuko gets cranky, cries for her mother, sings tunelessly when happy &amp; generally acts like any 5 year-old would in a similar situation. As the story progresses, &amp; she becomes weaker from malnutrition, there is no sugar coating; she complains of diarrhea, frets &amp; eventually becomes delusional. It was a typically small gesture that set off my tears towards the end: after Seita takes Setsuko to the doctor who can do nothing except tell him to feed her, he is carrying her down the road. An ice cart stops, the driver saws off a chunk of ice, &amp; walks into a house to deliver it. Seita kneels with Setsuko in his arms, scoops some ice chips from the dirt &amp; lovingly places them in Setsuko's mouth. The unbearable humanity of this gesture broke my resolve not to cry, &amp; if you don't have tears streaming down your face by then, you probably aren't human.Don't get &quot;Grave of the Fireflies&quot; because it's animated, or because you're a big Japanimation fan.

183275,A2NJO6YE954DBH,156219464X,Lawrance M. Bernabo,"[347, 365]","""Grave of the Fireflies"" (""Hotaru no haka"") is one of the most powerful anti-war films I have ever seen, which means that it has no competition when it comes to emotional impact in terms of animated films.  The death of Bambi's mother was a traumatic shock, but nothing like the sense of despair and grief that overwhelms you by the end of this film.  The film begins with the spirit of a young boy showing us his death in a train station, after which we follow the fireflies into the past to see his story.  At the beginning of the original movie of ""Brian's Song"" we were told: ""All true stories end in death.  This is a true story.""  So is ""Grave of the Fireflies"" because I have no problem granting the legitimacy of ""truth"" to fiction.In the last months of World War II an American fire bomb raid destroys the port city of Kobe, where almost all of the buildings are made of wood.  Seita (Tsutomu Tatsumi/J. Robert Spencer) is a 14-year old boy who survives along with his 4-year old sister Setsuko (Ayano Shiraishi/Rhoda Chrosite).  They were separated from their mother during the raid, which spares them from her fate.  Their father is a navy officer serving in the Imperial Navy at sea, and the two kids go off to live with an aunt.  With both his school and the war factory where we worked gone, Seita does not know what to do.  So he tries to take care of his sister.  But his aunt constantly berates him and after trading his mother's kimonos for rice that she stingly shares with the children, Seita decides to take Setsuko and live in a couple of caves dug for bomb shelters.  For a while their live remains idyllic, but then there is nothing left to trade for food, and no food to be bought for money.  Seita has to steal food to survive while Setsuko is getting weaker and weaker from hunger.This film is based on the semi-autobiographical novel written by Akiyuki Nosaka, which won the Naoli Prize, the Japanese equivalent of the Pulitzer Prize for Literature.  Like Seita, he survived the fire bombing with a younger sister, who died in his care.  Obviously the story stems from a sense of guilty and I believe telling this story was confessional rather than cathartic for Nosaka.  Writer-director Isao Takahata turns this tragedy into what can only be described as a poetic experience, achieving a cinematic lyricism that could never have been accomplished in a live-action film (e.g., the way the fireflies have a counterpoint in the pieces of ash that drift on the wind after the fire bombings).  There is a quietness to this film, a sense of contemplation that emphasizes important and small moments alike, and makes scenes linger as the heart-rending story plays out to its fatal conclusion.  The voice work by both of the young girls playing Setsuko is extremely effective; I have a slight preference for that done by Ayano Shiriashi simply because it is much more naturalistic than what you usually find in anime depicting children.""Graves of the Fireflies"" is an unforgettable film, one which will reduce most viewers to tears if not outright sobbing.  Watching it is a painful experience, but then a film depicting the horrors of war and showing what happens to young children is supposed to have that effect.  Viewing it a second time makes the experience even more intense (you probably will not catch what Setsuko's last words are the first time through, but be prepared for what it will do to you when you watch the film again).  You will never, ever forget this film and you should be very, very careful about showing it to younger children, because it will change forever what they think about animated films.  It will do that for you as well.",5,"Emotionally powerful, hauntingly poetic, anti-war anime",1044403200,"02 5, 2003",2003,3676,"['Grave', 'Fireflies', 'Hotaru', 'haka', 'one', 'most', 'powerful', 'anti-war', 'films', 'have', 'ever', 'seen', 'competition', 'when', 'emotional', 'impact', 'terms', 'animated', 'films', 'death', 'Bambi', 'mother', 'was', 'traumatic', 'shock', 'nothing', 'sense', 'despair', 'grief', 'end', 'film', 'film', 'spirit', 'young', 'boy', 'showing', 'death', 'train', 'station', 'follow', 'fireflies', 'past', 'see', 'story', 'beginning', 'original', 'movie', 'Brian', 'Song', 'were', 'told', 'true', 'stories', 'end', 'death', 'true', 'story', 'So', 'Grave', 'Fireflies', 'have', 'problem', 'granting', 'legitimacy', 'truth', 'fiction.In', 'last', 'months', 'World', 'War', 'II', 'American', 'fire', 'bomb', 'raid', 'port', 'city', 'Kobe', 'where', 'almost', 'buildings', 'are', 'made', 'wood', 'Seita', 'Tsutomu', 'Tatsumi/J', 'Robert', 'Spencer', '14-year', 'old', 'boy', 'who', '4-year', 'old', 'sister', 'Setsuko', 'Ayano', 'Shiraishi/Rhoda', 'Chrosite', 'were', 'separated', 'mother', 'raid', 'fate', 'father', 'navy', 'officer', 'serving', 'Imperial', 'Navy', 'sea', 'two', 'kids', 'go', 'live', 'aunt', 'school', 'war', 'factory', 'where', 'worked', 'gone', 'Seita', 'not', 'know', 'what', 'do', 'So', 'take', 'care', 'sister', 'aunt', 'constantly', 'trading', 'mother', 'kimonos', 'rice', 'stingly', 'shares', 'children', 'Seita', 'take', 'Setsuko', 'live', 'couple', 'caves', 'dug', 'bomb', 'shelters', 'live', 'idyllic', 'then', 'nothing', 'left', 'trade', 'food', 'food', 'be', 'bought', 'money', 'Seita', 'steal', 'food', 'survive', 'Setsuko', 'getting', 'weaker', 'weaker', 'hunger.This', 'film', 'based', 'semi-autobiographical', 'novel', 'written', 'Akiyuki', 'Nosaka', 'won', 'Naoli', 'Prize', 'Japanese', 'equivalent', 'Pulitzer', 'Prize', 'Literature', 'Seita', 'survived', 'fire', 'bombing', 'younger', 'sister', 'who', 'died', 'care', 'Obviously', 'story', 'sense', 'guilty', 'believe', 'telling', 'story', 'was', 'confessional', 'rather', 'cathartic', 'Nosaka', 'Writer-director', 'Isao', 'Takahata', 'tragedy', 'what', 'can', 'only', 'be', 'described', 'poetic', 'experience', 'achieving', 'cinematic', 'lyricism', 'could', 'never', 'have', 'been', 'accomplished', 'live-action', 'film', 'e.g.', 'way', 'fireflies', 'have', 'counterpoint', 'pieces', 'ash', 'drift', 'wind', 'fire', 'bombings', 'quietness', 'film', 'sense', 'contemplation', 'important', 'small', 'moments', 'alike', 'scenes', 'linger', 'heart-rending', 'story', 'out', 'fatal', 'conclusion', 'voice', 'work', 'young', 'girls', 'playing', 'Setsuko', 'extremely', 'effective', 'have', 'slight', 'preference', 'done', 'Ayano', 'Shiriashi', 'simply', 'much', 'more', 'naturalistic', 'what', 'usually', 'find', 'anime', 'depicting', 'children', 'Graves', 'Fireflies', 'unforgettable', 'film', 'one', 'will', 'reduce', 'most', 'viewers', 'tears', 'not', 'outright', 'sobbing', 'Watching', 'painful', 'experience', 'then', 'film', 'depicting', 'horrors', 'war', 'showing', 'what', 'young', 'children', 'supposed', 'have', 'effect', 'Viewing', 'second', 'time', 'experience', 'even', 'more', 'intense', 'probably', 'will', 'not', 'catch', 'what', 'Setsuko', 'last', 'words', 'are', 'first', 'time', 'be', 'prepared', 'what', 'will', 'do', 'when', 'watch', 'film', 'again', 'will', 'never', 'ever', 'forget', 'film', 'should', 'be', 'very', 'very', 'careful', 'showing', 'younger', 'children', 'will', 'change', 'forever', 'what', 'think', 'animated', 'films', 'will', 'do', 'as', 'well']",N/A
183276,AUS6TP9X0WI05,156219464X,"Lawrence G Coatney ""Geno""","[25, 28]","What a tremendous achievment. It is rare for a film with this kind of scope to be politically and nationally nuetral, just showing what it was like to live and die in a horrific time as World War 2. No finger pointing saying that it was the American's or the Allies' fault. No blame on their native homeland of Japan. Just the chance to watch and even feel the senslessness of war, poverty, inhospitality, and the worst result of any war, just or unjust, death. And one of the most amazing aspects of this film is that it is a cartoon! But after watching for only five or ten minutes you don't remember that its a cartoon, you are immersed in the real world, surrounded by people just trying to survive, even though the animation struck me as being very Hanna Barbarous.To truly convey the sense of immenent tragedy and hopelessness throughout the entire film they have the opening scene showing Seita (one of the main characters) die and his spirit reunite with that of his sister's, Setsuko, whereupon we watch the rest of the film as Seita remembers the events unfold around them. Right away we know that whatever they go through, whatever good or bad happens to them, Tragedy is lurking somewhere, waiting to strike.Personally, from then on, almost every scene was heartbreaking, but none more so than watching the slow degeneration of his sister's body trom malnutrion, but thankfully not her spirit. This is not to say they were all harsh. There were a few scenes that were just centered around the joy of being alive, but even then there was always something to remind us of what was going on around them. I was as happy as they were getting to watch them run down the beach and into the ocean, or seeing them chase fireflies outside of thier aunt's house, but the best time for me was their first night alone in the cave, and to help his sister to not be afraid, Seita helps Setesko catch a bunch of fireflies to light up their darkened abode. Seeing the wonder and enjoyment on her face was almost enough to bring me to tears after all the previous emotional despair. And it was then extra sad to see them wake up in the morning to dead fireflies and then taking the time to dig them a grave. Very touching.This young girl, while visibly suffering, was generally more prone to have fun and let her attention be diverted. You can see this come to its fufillment when Seita gives her a bite of the watermelon, and she uses her last words to say that it tastes good. No complaints about the pain she is obviously dealing with. No crying out to her brother that she doesn't want to die. Just a simple way of saying thank you to her brother. In this same scene we also see how much Sieta truly cares for Setsuko. After giving her the bite of watermelon, he generously sets a piece on her chest, and the rest within easy reach. Instead of breaking his fast with her, Seita selflessly rushes outside to start the rice cooking, more for her than for himself. In his rush to meet her needs he doesn't even realize that she has said her goodbye to him, and she dies while he is in the act of helping her in the only way he knows how.Another heart rending scene is after she dies and we see a rememberance of how she played and tried to help take care of their small live-in cave. Seeing all that innocence shown so purely in the face of a child in the midst of war moved me to tears and made me thankful to be a father of a similar aged little girl.This is a movie that truly stays with you and changes how you look at things. Normally after watching a movie I will read, write, or socialize with my wife of friends for awhile. Not so after this one. I went to bed deeply impressed by what I had seen. I awoke the next day thinking about it. I had one of the most mellencholy days that I have ever worked because I was in a constant remeberance of it, trying to soak up all the lessons in it, as I knew I would not watch it again for a long while. It was almost twenty hours later that I finally picked up a book again, a long time for me. And even now it is still right there, beneath the surface of my normal thoughts. Just writing this review brings back vivid scenes.One last thought about the movie. As other reviews have said, it was upsetting to see the way their aunt treated them. She basically drove them out of the house in all ways short of actually telling them to leave. But one cannot really blame her for her actions. Sure she was being selfish. But she was also living in fear. It really was taxing her family's resources having them there. There wasn't much to go around.In these kind of circumstances most people will try to hold onto everything, becuase you might not survive if you have to share your meager things with others. She shared with animosity and disaproval of their every action because she had no ideathat giving out of Love and a desire to help your fellow human will bring you more back in return.My final words are watch this. Even if it is hard for tuo to see, or brings up things you thought were past, watch it anyhow. You will be better off for it. Personally I would not recomend letting children view this though. Let them retain their innocence while they have it. War, pain ,and death are not pretty sights, but even less so for our young ones.",5,A Sharp and Bitter Taste of Tragedy,1088380800,"06 28, 2004",2004,5288,"['What', 'tremendous', 'achievment', 'rare',

The novel and film are set near the end of World War II in Japan.  The bulk of the story is told through flashbacks, and it is a story about two children trying to survive after the bombing of Kobe.On the first disc of this set, you can watch a storyboard version of the film, in addition to the regular version.  The second disc includes: an interview with Roger Ebert, interview with Isao Takahata, text-only biographies of Akiyuki Nosaka and Isa Takahata, a ""Japanese Release Promo,"" a documentary about how Central Park Media restored the film, an art gallery, and the U.S. and Japanese trailers for the film.The back of the DVD box may say that the film is for ages ""3 and up,"" but I believe this is a typo.  Between some of the shots included in the film, as well as the subject matter and the historical knowledge needed, this film is more appropriate for viewers 13 and up.  If you think your child is too young for a film like Schindler's List, but you want to start exposing your child to these kind of historical events, then Grave of the Fireflies would be a good place to start.  It should be noted that while the ideas presented in both films are similar, they are polar opposites of each other.  Schindler's List is about hope, while Grave of the Fireflies is more about despair.Grave of the Fireflies is a very well-made anime film, and after viewing it, I can see why it's considered such an anime classic.

You can feel the pangs of hunger of the children, and taste the food they manage to find.  The viewer can feel the ocean as the children swim, the rain on their heads, and can smell the summer greenery in the Japanese countryside. There are scenes of bloody and burned corpses.

His father is in the Navy, his mother died after a bombing and he has to take care of his sister. They then go to stay with a friend of theirs. They manage to sell some stuff to get money to buy food, which at the time is scarce. The two eventually get tired of living with the strict woman and leave to make they're own home in a cave. But Seita's little sister gets sick. He does all he can to help her feel better, but nothing works and she soon dies. Seeing the little flashbacks of her playing near the cave with classic music playing is enough to make anyone cry. After Seita heres his father died at sea, he is the only one of his family left. He incinerates his sister body and soon he too dies. This is one of those movies to make you cry. The plot is that of how life would treat you. It's no wonder this movie got awards. There are some nice scenes in the movie with Seita playing with his sister. And its those little things which make the tragedy of death even greater. If a movie can do this, I think it deserves awards.

From the beginning, the viewer is made aware of the fate of these two kids, as the story is told in retrospect. Those little moments of hopeful joy throughout the film are anchored in knowing that their fate is sealed. The story is told masterfully, with a journalistic &#34;you are there&#34; approach, as the camera follows these two through their struggle to find their family, and the realization that the worst has happened.This film is as much an indictment of the callous inhumanity of the Japanese people, toward their own, as adults are helpless to do anything for these kids, who wander homeless, seeking shelter, food and medicine. Even their aunt treats them like lazy bums, offering nothing but vitriol and admonishment, but little compassion.The scenery, animation, sound work and music all work together to form a perfect synergy which envelops the viewer in the reality that many kids, made homeless by the war, faced. It is a stinging indictment of the horrors of war, even for the innocent members of society who may have not yet formed their political allegiances.This is not a film that you watch for entertainment. I don't recommend viewing it unless your personal life is in good order, because it is so depressing.

Although the characters are animated, the story is based on real events taking place in Japan at the end of World War II when Napalm firebombs were dropped onto Japanese dwellings that were essentially kindling.The movie is apolitical.  There is no mention of the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor, or of the nuclear bombs that ended the war.  There is only the reality of the war, and our character's efforts to deal with it.  It is not difficult to say that the film is ""anti-war"" because the intense suffering and hardship occurs as a direct result of the war, but it is also a movie about doing what you have to to survive in times of extreme hardship.  It's about friendship and the kind of bonds that exist between family members - and about how those bonds are stronger the closer you are.The entire movie is about a young boy - too young to be a soldier, but too old for an orphanage when his mother is killed in an early firebomb air-raid.  It is also about his much younger sister - probably about kindergarten-aged.Dad is away serving in the Navy when Mom is killed in the early moments of the film.  Brother and Sister go to live with an Aunt who at first shows them the courtesy that family members would receive, but grows resentful that she is having to shelter and feed her niece and nephew when her own family is working for the war effort and starving as well.  Her comments become increasingly harsh and critical until the boy decides to move out with his sister to an air-raid shelter.This is not a happy story.  It becomes increasingly grim - you see in the opening moments the ghost-spirits of the brother and sister reuniting after the brother dies, so you know to expect a harsh ending.  The way this movie arrives at this conclusion is full of grace and elegant, poignant moments.  Brother and Sister repeatedly make noble sacrifices and gestures for the benefit of the other.We watched this DVD in a room full of a half-dozen teenagers and adults.  Over and over the comment I heard was along the lines of ""that's so SAD!"", but at the end ""I loved it!""  It's a movie like that.  The small touches make me appreciate the realism.  The brother rescues a small tin of fruit drops early in the film, and he rations them out to his sister until they run out.  At one point there are 3 left and he pulls them out - they're all stuck together and he has to pull one apart.  A few slivers of fruit drops are on his hand and she takes just one of the slivers - she has learned to ration as well.The movie makes you sad, but it encourages me to know that the world includes the kind of people who would make a movie like this.",5,Full of Realistic Touches,1104710400,"01 3, 2005",2005,2695,"['Grave', 'Fireflies', 'not', 'lighthearted', 'cartoon', 'characters', 'are', 'animated', 'story', 'based', 'real', 'events', 'taking', 'place', 'Japan', 'end', 'World', 'War', 'II', 'when', 'Napalm', 'firebombs', 'were', 'dropped', 'Japanese', 'dwellings', 'were', 'essentially', 'kindling.The', 'movie', 'apolitical', 'mention', 'Japanese', 'attack', 'Pearl', 'Harbor', 'nuclear', 'bombs', 'ended', 'war', 'only', 'reality', 'war', 'character', 'efforts', 'deal', 'not', 'difficult', 'say', 'film', 'anti-war', 'intense', 'suffering', 'hardship', 'direct', 'result', 'war', 'also', 'movie', 'doing', 'what', 'have', 'survive', 'times', 'extreme', 'hardship', 'friendship', 'kind', 'bonds', 'exist', 'family', 'members', 'how', 'bonds', 'are', 'stronger', 'closer', 'are.The', 'entire', 'movie', 'young', 'boy', 'too', 'young', 'be', 'soldier', 'too', 'old', 'orphanage', 'when', 'mother', 'killed', 'early', 'firebomb', 'air-raid', 'also', 'much', 'younger', 'sister', 'probably', 'kindergarten-aged.Dad', 'away', 'serving', 'Navy', 'when', 'Mom', 'killed', 'early', 'moments', 'film', 'Brother', 'Sister', 'go', 'live', 'Aunt', 'who', 'first', 'courtesy', 'family', 'members', 'would', 'receive', 'resentful', 'having', 'shelter', 'feed', 'niece', 'nephew', 'when', 'own', 'family', 'working', 'war', 'effort', 'starving', 'as', 'well', 'comments', 'become', 'increasingly', 'harsh', 'critical', 'boy', 'move', 'out', 'sister', 'air-raid', 'shelter.This', 'not', 'happy', 'story', 'increasingly', 'grim', 'see', 'opening', 'ghost-spirits', 'brother', 'sister', 'reuniting', 'brother', 'know', 'expect', 'harsh', 'ending', 'way', 'movie', 'conclusion', 'full', 'grace', 'elegant', 'poignant', 'moments', 'Brother', 'Sister', 'repeatedly', 'make', 'noble', 'sacrifices', 'gestures', 'benefit', 'other.We', 'watched', 'DVD', 'room', 'full', 'half-dozen', 'teenagers', 'adults', 'comment', 'heard', 'was', 'lines', 'so', 'SAD', 'end', 'loved', 'movie', 'small', 'touches', 'make', 'appreciate', 'realism', 'brother', 'small', 'tin', 'fruit', 'drops', 'early', 'film', 'out', 'sister', 'run', 'out', 'one', 'point', 'are', '3', 'left', 'out', ""'re"", 'stuck', 'together', 'pull', 'one', 'apart', 'few', 'slivers', 'fruit', 'drops', 'are', 'hand', 'just', 'one', 'slivers', 'learned', 'ration', 'well.The', 'movie', 'sad', 'know', 'world', 'kind', 'people', 'who', 'would', 'make', 'movie']",N/A
183286,ASU3THM5ZUTUI,156219464X,"Mark Lee ""Peacemaker""","[1, 3]","&lt;sniff&gt; Let me start out by saying that this is truly a shocking movie.  I saw it thinking that it was just another World War II movie, only in 2-D.  Boy, was I wrong.  I may never forget this film.  It's so depressing that it hurts to watch.This is basically a story of how a 14-year-old boy (Seita)and his 4-year-old sister(Setsuko)died after America bombed Japan.  Their mother died of a disease, their father died in the navy, and their aunt doesn't want to live with them.  So these two kids are forced to live in their own little bomb shelter.  Slowly, they begin to lose their young, innocent lives to the merciless war.  The ending comes as no surprise, but the WAY it comes.....wow.  I especially remember the scene where Setsuko walks out of the bomb shelter's enterance with the world's cutest look on her face, as if she were to say, &quot;Hello.  My name's Setsuko.  What's yours?&quot;  At that point, I was thinking: &quot;Oh my gosh, she's so cute!  Why did she have to DIE?&quot;  &lt;sob&gt;This movie was rated PG, but I don't think it should be.  It has many images of wounded, some showing rather bloody results.  And the whole idea about these two innocent children dying in the war is actually quite disturbing.  I would've rated it PG-13, but then that's the MPAA for you.Now then, WHY did I rate this only 4 stars?  Simple: Even though this film is very well-done, it is extremely painful to watch.  It doesn't leave feeling better afterwards.  I doubt that I will ever watch it again.  Still, I recommend this film to everyone who thinks Japan deserved to suffer.  You will never look at World War II the same way ever again.  And don't worry if it leaves you crying like a baby.

183287,A3R6XTCAE182S,156219464X,"Mary J. Alderdice ""geek, book lover, craft fiend""","[47, 51]","For those who insist that cartoons of all forms, and particularly anime, are for children, I present you with Grave of the Fireflies. This amazingly well-done anime has some of the most touching, most depressing scenes I've ever seen on a screen, regardless of format.This film is set in Japan near the end of World War 2. Seita and Setsuko live in Kobe with their mother, whom they adore. When the air raid sirens sound, Seita and Setsuko run ahead to the bomb shelter, leaving their mother (who has a heart condition and cannot run) to follow. Seita is obviously not happy with this situation, but the early teen youth cannot carry both his toddler sister and his mother, so he agrees, sure his mother will join them at the shelter.From here begins the long, sad tale of the losses that Seita and Setsuko suffer through together. This is very much the story of a young man forced into the role of provider, protector, and nurturer years ahead of time, and of his little sister who adores him. Seita struggles to provide for himself and for Setsuko, and refuses to surrender himself to despair, regardless of the obstacles he is presented.I feel that this movie is all the more heart-wrenching for the way that the hurt and the pain and the fear are interspersed with the moments of joy and lightheartedness. For much of the movie, it is almost possible to believe that Seita and Setsuko will come out of this together. Of course, since the movie opens with Seita dying, alone, you know that your hope is misplaced, but you want them to survive. The love they share, and the joy they take from one another make you root for them.The characters in Grave of the Fireflies are remarkably well acted. Seita, standing strong, doing whatever is necessary to take care of his little sister. Setsuko is the perfect toddler. Happy one moment, crying the next, unsure of why anything is happening, but sure that Seita can fix everything. The childrens' aunt, a cold, sarcastic, bitter woman, taking every opportunity to ensure the children, especially Seita, is aware of how much they impose upon her and her patriotic family.In addition to the quality of the story and the caliber of the actors, the beauty of the artwork is just incredible. The facial expressions, the landscapes, the atmosphere. It's all wonderful, drawing you into the story. I found myself checking to see if the prone form of Setsuko was breathing as she lie ill, then realizing that wait, this is animation.This provocative, compelling tragedy is based upon a true story. The original author, Nosaka Akiyuki, wrote a novel based upon his real-life experiences at the end of the war in Japan. This story was then turned into a manga (Japanese comic book), and the story became very popular and well-known.Trivia buffs might be interested in knowing exactly how this movie made it to the screen. A director by the name of Hayao Miyazaki was working on a project named ""My Neighbor Totoro"" but the production company was worried that nobody would be interested in the tale of two little kids and a monster living in rural Japan. Therefore, they decided to make a movie they felt would draw viewers based upon the familiarity of the tale and for the educational value of the story, and make it a double-feature with ""My Neighbor Totoro"", billing and packaging the two movies together. Those who are familiar with both movies find the concept of packaging or viewing the cheery, light-hearted romp that is Totoro with such somber, depressing fare as ""Grave of the Fireflies"" mind-boggling, but the tactic seemed to work, though Totoro has become far more popular and well-known of the two movies.I cannot recommend this movie enough. It is a poignant story of the love shared by a pair of siblings in the worst possible conditions.

183288,A1DUWRMZVLRKAJ,156219464X,maskedgamer,"[5, 63]","If you enjoy watching the animated tale of a boys stupidity for 2 hours than you'll love this film. This is another animated tale right up there with other break through Japanese releases that reach the mainstream and get high reviews and remarks from people who probably aren't familiar with anime in general. Having no idea on the subject they deem is a masterpiece and praise it.This movie about the struggles of the Japanese in WW2 I find to be quite interesting. Despite the fact the only reason we bombed and gunned the hell out of their country mainly was because they decided to Bomb pearl harbor but, in the movie it makes Japan look like the victims as big bad America terrorizes the innocent villagers and sinks their battleships. Good ol' America is the bad guy in this film. I think I'd rather watch an animated movie about Unit 731. Than this biased historical fiction.Anyhow stepping aside this movie is mainly about an idiot and his sister. The boy has shelter to go to but he refuses to do so and tragedy ends up striking his sister. Despite the fact the moron decides to leave food and shelter behind to find a shack in the woods so he can raise his sister himself I don't find interesting. The idea that he doesn't realize he should put his sisters health before his pride is ridiculous. The fact that the doctor tells him that his sister just needs to ""EAT"" and he still doesn't get it is ridiculous. Then the dumbest part of all is that there is money in the bank for them to get food or so the movie makes it seem but he never does until he finally gets it.I'm sure people love this film and will try to point out how the author is trying to honor his Sister but honestly why this animated tale? It's not interesting, it's slow, dull, poorly written, and like watching someone torture a child out of their sheer stupidity. If this was a real movie with actors I'm sure people would be throwing popcorn at the screen. As an anime it survives only by that target group of people who aren't familiar with the story telling styles of anime and can't perceive a good tale form a bad one. ""Le Chevalier d'Eon"" was dramatic historical anime fiction but it was well told an interesting.Sorry, but has someone who enjoys watching anime of all genre's and types... this one just didn't make the cut.

183290,A3KDC5EZSA8AZJ,156219464X,"Menachem Rephun ""Billy Sluthers McShea""","[2, 3]","""Grave of the fireflies"" is an anime film (for the uninititated, anime is the term used to describe a style of animation used by artists in Japan)  markedly different from it's contemporaries in both style and substance.First of all, where most animated films are geared towards young audiences and have plots of juvenile (or worse: I'm talking to you, ""Lilo & Stitch 2"") dimensions, ""Grave of the firefiles"" is a film which instead chooses to tell a story of great emotional maturity and power. The result is undeniably the most moving ""cartoon"" ever made.Seito and Setsuko are two young children living with their mother (their father is away at sea) in the Japanese port city of Kobe at the end of WWII. When Kobe is fire-bombed by enemy (i.e American) planes, the fragile city is destroyed, their mother is killed, and Seito and Setsuko are left to fend for themselves in an indifferent and sometimes hostile environment.You will probably note from this brief synopis that the plot of ""fireflies"" differs considerably from that of the typical ""kiddie cartoon"". Indeed, very few animated films tend to make serious statements about war, let alone involve thoroughly realistic characters and protagonists. But that's just what happens in Isao Takahata's ""Grave of the fireflies"", and, though rather upsetting, the result is pretty damned heart-wrenching stuff.WARNING: Despite being a little broad and simplified (especially about the political situation at the time: Americans, though never mentioned by name, are basically reduced to villains who fly overhead in B-24s and randomly shower people with bombs) with characters (especially Setsuko) whose lines of dialogue are often restricted to things like ""I'm thirsty"" or ""I'm hungry"", this movie is very realistic and is quite a painful and upsetting experience that put a hardened ""serious"" film-goer like myself on the verge of tears, something which rarely happens to me at the movies, let alone a so-called ""cartoon"". But if you see ""Grave of the fireflies"", even if you're not neccessarily a fan of ""Anime"" (I'm not, really), chances are it's surplus of powerful images will make you somewhat moist-eyed as well.

Having become addicted to the movies of Miyazaki, I stumbled on this title a an Amazon.com recommendation.  I read the descriptions and reviews and decided to chance a few bucks to see what all the fuss what about.Rarely have I spent my money better.  Grave of the Fireflies is not just one the best animated films of all time -- it is one of the best films of all time period.  It is the semi-autobiographical tale of two children trying to survive in Japan during the last days of World War II.  Having lost their parents, they stuggle to survive through the terrifying fire-bombing of their city, the resentment of their surviving relatives and the gradual depletion of their food supplies.  I won't spoil it for you by telling you that it ends in tragedy -- the very first words of the film reveal this.But for a movie whose subject is so depressing and tragic, this is, at the same time, an uplifting and inspiring film. The interaction between Seita and Setsuko is a wonder to behold.  Some of the films moments -- Seita and Setsuko smuggling fireflies under their mosquito nets and the stunning cremation scene -- have stayed in my mind for months after watching them.  This is a film that draws tears from the viewer while at the same time inspiring him to enjoy life.  It's a rare gem of a movie than can do both.The Collector's Edition is an oustanding DVD.  The transfer is simply beautiful.  The extra have some nice touches including an interview with Roger Ebert -- a relentless champion of this movie.Take the plunge.

This was then made into this 1988 film by Isao Takahata of Studio Ghibli.Knowing, then, that it is a more or less true story gives the movie more weight. The first time I watched it I was unaware of that fact, and so had my doubts as to exactly how accurate it was. When reading a book or watching a movie set in wartime, I prefer it to be true, as it's hard to know if they are either underplaying the true horror of the time or exaggerating it.""Grave of the Fireflies"" is well worth watching because it shows the real effects of war on two innocent children. It was a good watch for me personally because it told the truth, even if it did break my heart. I encourage you to watch it at least once, painful as it is, because it helps real historical events become more real to those of us who often shield our eyes or cover our ears against such horrific happenings because they are terribly unpleasant and do not seem to affect us anymore. 4 stars.A note on the English dubs: while the Japanese version's audio is very well done, the old English dub is not especially well-acted, and a grown woman voices the little 4-year-old girl, Setsuko. When I heard that Sentai Filmworks had released a blu-ray of the film in 2012 with not only the original Japanese version with subtitles and the old English dub, but also a NEW English dub, I was very excited. However, this turned out to be even worse than the old dub. Setsuko is once again voiced by a grown woman, only a grown woman who did not do quite as well as the woman in the old one, and Setsuko's older brother Seita sounds as though he's not used to speaking to children at all. Another fault of the release is that the subtitles for the Japanese version are actually dubtitles: they tell you what is being said in the English version rather than a literal translation from the Japanese.

Seeing this for the first time this weekend a few thoughts immediately come to mind:- why did the mom leave her children and go to the bomb shelter by herself and leave a 4 year old daughter behind?  blows my mind that parental mistake- I found myself hoping the kids would find food or someone would help them as their predicament continued to deteriorate.  it was gut wrenching to see them go down the slope of hope like that.- Seeing the bombers in the sky was just mesmerizing - the way they were brought onto the screen and the impact of its message was decisive with absolute power and relentlessly barberic.  The bombers dropped firebombs on women and children not only to kill them but to burn down their homes, schools, churches and sanctity of community and make the Japanese suffer pyschologically in addition to any killings they could get.  Kind of like ""Shock and Awe"" but with hatred and brutality of casualites attached.  Utterly dispicable.- The little girl was so courageous...a four year old able to stay in a cave or dark field alone at night while her brother is away trying to steal food for them...She was heroic in her attitude.- To see people just turn away from these children and not help them was shameful...but Im sure we've done it ourselves each and every day we see a homeless person or bum on the street....where's the human compassion- I don't know how a person could not be crying when they play that music and collage of the little girl right as she passes away from starvation and despair....This DVD should be delivered to the front steps of the white house and mr.

183308,A3BAGKMJFQCJAQ,156219464X,Nicholas Jarak,"[0, 1]","First, I'd like to start off by saying that this film is a fine example of Studio Ghibli animation. The animation and artwork are beautifully rendered. The characters are excellently portrayed. The decisions the characters make match up very well with the characters themselves, and at no point did I feel the that character's strayed from their personalities. The story is truly emotional and really draws you in. You really begin to feel for the characters, and empathize with them. On almost all counts this really is a wonderfully made film. The only problem with it is that I feel that the story is emotionally unbalanced. Most films have their highs and their lows. They don't always necessarily balance out, and they don't always have to, but there's usually a fair balance of uplifting and sad moments in story. But this story is like falling down Mount Everest. It's almost all sad and depressing. There are a few happy moments. I mean, I'm sure while tumbling down Mount Everest you might bounce up a couple times before you continue your descent, but this film is such a downer. I've watched plenty of films with sad moments and sad endings, but this one takes the cake. On all other counts its such a wonderful film, but it's just such a downer throughout almost the entire film that I can't bring myself to watch it again. It is now one of my points of reference when I describe how sad a story was. Usually I'll say, ""It's not Grave of Fireflies sad, but it's still sad."" It'd be different if it had a few more happy moments to pick you up a little before it kicks you in the groin again, but the happy moments are so sparse that it really feels like it knocks you to the ground and then just keeps kicking you while you are down over and over again. Then just when it gives you the hope that you might be able to stand up again, it kicks you again. Before you know it, the film is over, and you are a bloody pulp of sadness wondering, ""Why did I just do that to myself?""I absolutely recommend that everyone watch this film at least once. It truly is an experience like no other, but I just can't recommend buying it because I honestly don't know if you'll want to watch it more than once. You'll probably remember this movie like a emotional scar of your past, so you probably won't want to watch it again any time soon. I'd highly recommend renting this or borrowing it from a friend before you make the decision to buy it. This is the only reason why I've taken two stars off of my rating because buying a movie usually means wanting to watch it again, and I can honestly say that I don't want to watch this movie again any time soon. I last saw this movie, years ago, and I still haven't wanted to watch it again. It's very conflicting because it's good in all other respects. I'll sometimes think, ""Oh, maybe Grave of Fireflies would be good to watch."" Then I remember the story, and think ""...maybe not. I don't feel like being depressed.""Just be aware. This film is very sad. Please understand that this film is not going to be suitable for young children. The story is a very mature story in that it is a rough emotional journey to watch that young children may have trouble handling or they may not have the patience for it. People should know that not all animation is suitable for kids. I also wouldn't recommend this film if you have any serious issues with depression because... well to put it simply, this film is not going to make you feel any better.I'm sorry if anyone disagrees with my rating, but it's my opinion. I love movies that manage to get an emotional reaction out of me, but this movie was almost emotionally torturous. It's awesome when a movie gets you to empathize with the characters so much that it can get you to cry (I love that), but this movie was beyond words for me. I'm really conflicted on this movie. It's an amazing film, but it makes you feel horrible for watching it, which is not what I'm looking for in my entertainment choices. I almost wanted to give it four stars, but I can't bring myself to do it because I feel that a major reason for buying a movie on blu-ray is wanting to watch it again, and I honestly don't want to see this again any time soon.",3,A Wonderfully made but Unbalanced Film,1390694400,"01 26, 2014",2014,4216,"['First', ""'d"", 'like', 'start', 'off', 'saying', 'film', 'fine', 'example', 'Studio', 'Ghibli', 'animation', 'animation', 'artwork', 'are', 'beautifully', 'rendered', 'characters', 'are', 'excellently', 'portrayed', 'decisions', 'characters', 'make', 'match', 'up', 'very', 'well', 'characters', 'point', 'did', 'feel', 'character', 'strayed', 'personalities', 'story', 'truly', 'emotional', 'really', 'draws', 'really', 'begin', 'feel', 'characters', 'empathize', 'almost', 'counts', 'really', 'wonderfully', 'made', 'film', 'only', 'problem', 'feel', 'story', 'emotionally', 'unbalanced', 'Most', 'films', 'have', 'highs', 'lows', 'do', ""n't"", 'always', 'necessarily', 'balance', 'out', 'do', ""n't"", 'always', 'have', 'usually', 'fair', 'balance', 'uplifting', 'sad', 'moments', 'story', 'story', 'falling', 'down', 'Mount', 'Everest', 'almost', 'sad', 'depressing', 'are', 'few', 'happy', 'moments', 'mean', ""'m"", 'sure', 'tumbling', 'down', 'Mount', 'Everest', 'might', 'bounce', 'up', 'couple', 'times', 'continue', 'descent', 'film', 'downer', ""'ve"", 'watched', 'plenty', 'films', 'sad', 'moments', 'sad', 'endings', 'one', 'cake', 'other', 'such', 'wonderful', 'film', 'just', 'such', 'downer', 'almost', 'entire', 'film', 'ca', ""n't"", 'bring', 'watch', 'again', 'now', 'one', 'points', 'reference', 'when', 'describe', 'how', 'sad', 'story', 'was', 'Usually', ""'ll"", 'say', 'not', 'Grave', 'Fireflies', 'sad', 'still', 'sad', ""'d"", 'be', 'different', 'had', 'few', 'more', 'happy', 'moments', 'pick', 'up', 'little', 'groin', 'again', 'happy', 'moments', 'are', 'so', 'sparse', 'really', 'ground', 'then', 'just', 'keeps', 'kicking', 'are', 'down', 'over', 'over', 'again', 'Then', 'just', 'when', 'hope', 'might', 'be', 'able', 'stand', 'up', 'again', 'again', 'know', 'film', 'are', 'bloody', 'pulp', 'sadness', 'wondering', 'Why', 'did', 'just', 'do', 'myself', 'absolutely', 'recommend', 'everyone', 'watch', 'film', 'least', 'once', 'truly', 'experience', 'other', 'just', 'ca', ""n't"", 'recommend', 'buying', 'honestly', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', ""'ll"", 'want', 'watch', 'more', 'once', ""'ll"", 'probably', 'remember', 'movie', 'emotional', 'scar', 'past', 'probably', 'wo', ""n't"", 'want', 'watch', 'again', 'time', 'soon', ""'d"", 'highly', 'recommend', 'renting', 'borrowing', 'friend', 'make', 'decision', 'buy', 'only', 'reason', 'why', ""'ve"", 'taken', 'two', 'stars', 'rating', 'buying', 'movie', 'usually', 'wanting', 'watch', 'again', 'can', 'honestly', 'say', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'watch', 'movie', 'again', 'time', 'soon', 'last', 'saw', 'movie', 'years', 'ago', 'still', 'have', ""n't"", 'wanted', 'watch', 'again', 'very', 'conflicting', 'good', 'other', 'respects', ""'ll"", 'sometimes', 'think', 'Oh', 'maybe', 'Grave', 'Fireflies', 'would', 'be', 'good', 'watch', 'Then', 'remember', 'story', 'think', 'maybe', 'not', 'do', ""n't"", 'feel', 'being', 'depressed', 'Just', 'be', 'aware', 'film', 'very', 'sad', 'Please', 'understand', 'film', 'not', 'going', 'be', 'suitable', 'young', 'children', 'story', 'very', 'mature', 'story', 'rough', 'emotional', 'journey', 'watch', 'young', 'children', 'may', 'have', 'trouble', 'handling', 'may', 'not', 'have', 'patience', 'People', 'should', 'know', 'not', 'animation', 'suitable', 'kids', 'also', 'would', ""n't"", 'recommend', 'film', 'have', 'serious', 'issues', 'depression', 'well', 'put', 'simply', 'film', 'not', 'going', 'make', 'feel', 'better.I', ""'m"", 'sorry', 'anyone', 'rating', 'opinion', 'love', 'movies', 'manage', 'get', 'emotional', 'reaction', 'movie', 'was', 'almost', 'emotionally', 'torturous', 'awesome', 'when', 'movie', 'empathize', 'characters', 'so', 'much', 'can', 'get', 'cry', 'love', 'movie', 'was', 'words', ""'m"", 'really', 'conflicted', 'movie', 'amazing', 'film', 'feel', 'horrible', 'watching', 'not', 'what', ""'m"", 'looking', 'entertainment', 'choices', 'almost', 'wanted', 'give', 'four', 'stars', 'ca', ""n't"", 'bring', 'do', 'feel', 'major', 'reason', 'buying', 'movie', 'blu-ray', 'wanting', 'watch', 'again', 'honestly', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'see', 'again', 'time', 'soon']",N/A

Its sheer gritty realism and true to life tragedy give it a meaning that goes far beyond just hearing about the tragic deaths.  Here we can see it first hand through the experiences of two children, both innocent but soon corrupted by their futile situation.  The movie starts off with us seeing the ghost of a boy looking upon his own self, shortly after he has died.  Then, he and the ghost of his little sister ride in a train, and the movie then starts as a flashback, while the children were living happily with their mother just before their home is destroyed.The older boy, Seita, and his little sister, Satsuko are orphaned and must live with their aunt, who is a little less than pleasant and urges them to do more for the war effort in Japan.  So instead, they run away.  Seita, being the older brother, neglects that the hardships lying ahead will not only effect him, but his sister as well.  Post war time, he must resort to stealing when he runs out of money and things to trade.  Their home is barely a home at all.

Last week I finally bit the bullet and let myself be washed over by the beauty and sorrow of this film.  The film is beautifully illustrated and at times sublimely grotesque and realistic.  The story is simple but so heart breaking.  To follow two children who suffer slowly to die due to events totally out of their control.  They symbolize the many who suffer the same fate day after day in warring lands.  It is therefore such tragedy that tired old men who have never come face to face with the horrors of war get to play cowboys and indians every day.  Would they have the same fervor if their own children have to suffer like Seita and Sasako?  Would they be willing to mobilize their troups if the troops were their own flesh and blood?

But Fireflies belongs in a category all its own; this is traditional anime where the coarse animation and visual weight do not overshadow the underlying thematic messages of tragedy and lost innocence.Fireflies is captivating in one sense because it is an entirely self-reflective war film. Unlike Hollywood cinema that glorifies and rationalizes wartime events, this Japanese film makes no such commentary. There is no direct reference to who the real enemy is, even though the bomber planes are used as a powerful plot device. Instead, Fireflies focuses entirely on the struggles of two characters caught in the middle, a surprisingly uncommon and underappreciated perspective for American cinema standards. Merely watching this film from this standpoint makes it a war film entirely refreshing, poignant, and uplifting.I found the animation to be sub-par when compared to more celebrated anime (Spirited Away, Ghost in the Shell, Princess Mononoke), yet I found that to be more compelling. Visually, everything in Fireflies is coarse, dilapidated and impoverish. The color palette of browns and grays is wonderfully lifeless and unspoken. The backgrounds are largely unfilled and conservative in decoration; in this case, less is clearly more. While the trademark bug-eyed characters and exaggerated facial features are still present, one can easily notice the growing burden of war in their wearied faces by the film's end.One should not come away from this film focusing on plot development or characterization. This isn't a film about judging characters for their inabilities or human faults. Instead it is about what is heartfelt, empathizing Seita for his efforts, realizing the children's limitations and the confines of victims who are surrounded by cruelty both seen and unseen. To understand that the tragedy was inescapable and that lifelong remorse is worse than death is to fully appreciate the film's message. The fact that Fireflies is based closely on true events does not make it any more believable or touching.In terms of both pacing and emotional weight, Fireflies requires tremendous patience. This is a feeling movie, not one of actions and dramatic sequences.

GOTF is not your run of the mill anime. Yes, it does have the characters with the big eyes and mouth, but that where the similarities end. No fantasical creature running around. No buxom babes with handsome boyfriends trying to save the world.The time is near the end of WWII. An air raid not only makes a teenage brother and his baby sister homeless, but orphans as well. They go to live with an aunt in another town. But this is a time of war. Life is hard, and extra mouths to feed are a nusance. The aunt is not evil, so much as hardened from the experience and her attitude drives the children to away. They move into a shelter. The siblings maintain optimism, but the reality of the situation starts to sink in.Desperate times call for desperate measures, and the boy resorts to stealing. During air raids while everyone else is running away from their homes into shelters he is running into town, through the fires and bombs, to scrimp for leftovers and things he can trade. It's no secret that the siblings die. The movie circles around their desperation to live and survive, and the means they are willing to take in order to get food.  Thus they are the casuality of war; a politician's game where the only ones who suffer are the ones who are fighting and their families. This point is brought home in one particular scene where a villager screams during one air raid ""Long live the emperor!"" while his peers die around him.Grave of the Fireflies is based on a true story. Often Japan is villianized for its participation in WWII and what it did to the States and its sister Asian nations.

183327,A2E3IB2ZHJ7QXJ,156219464X,Private Quentin Tarantino Fan,"[3, 3]","I am quiet amazed that many war film buffs haven't heard of Grave of the Fireflies.  Go on this site alone and watch people list mediocre, junky, war films like Fixed Bayonets, Sands of Iwo Jima, and Pork Chop Hill as their favorites, without a mention of this film in sight.  Boggles my mind, really.  In my opinion, Grave of the Fireflies is easily one of the most powerfully emotional and sad anti-war movies ever made.  Most war movies are painful and harrowing when I watch them (instead of being sad, or ""tearjerkers"", for me at least), but few war movies manage to be sad, painful, humanistic, harrowing, and tear jerking at the same time.  Grave of the fireflies pulls no punches in its display of personal struggle in the midst of dark times, and I can easily say it's THE war movie that displays the harrowing struggle of being a civilian during the times of war.I've seen over 100 war movies so far (please note I have not been a war film watcher for all of my life either), and Grave of the Fireflies still manages to also offer an influenced, yet fresh and unique kind of war movie, certainly nothing else that offers the experience. Imagine the same type of civilian depiction of earlier humanistic war films (especially neo-realistic films) like Germany Year Zero, as well as other films like The Bicycle Thieves (two great films).  The kind of movie that focuses on the lowest class of citizens.  Grave of the Fireflies is that kind of movie. However, instead of being relentlessly gritty and documentary like, Grave offers a cinematic experience to the story, using top-notch storytelling values without being the least manipulative.  Oh, and it's an anime, in the best way possible.Being an excellent piece of animated art; it uses the animation medium to truly bring out the poetic and sad aspects of the film.  It's extremely poetic, and the animation is moody, artful.  Studio Ghibli is known for it's terrific animation, and Grave is a lush, beautiful, detailed, and painted piece of film, no doubt helped by the same people who made other visually well made films such as My Neighbor Toto.  It's an extremely visually stunning work, and like many other war films, is extremey moving.  Even more impressive is that this movie was made in the late 80's, alongside other visually stunning works like Akira.  I'll stop describing too much because quite frankly, it would become too long winded, but it's just amazing.  The film's wonderful use of animation reminds me of Pixar, despite the two films being entirely different in story telling and emotional connection (Note to Pixar: can you guys do a war film sometime?).Grave of the Fireflies agonizing humanism works in its uncompromising and humanistic, but ultimately shattering and depressing consequences.  As you can see from the numerous reviewers, this is not a happy story.  This is depressing film that.  Be warned.  If you go to a war movie with a feeling that you are going to get clear black and white depictions drawn in the sand, you will be sorely disappointed.  There is no Japanese stereotyping here.  There is no sense of evil or good.  There are no heroes and villians (of course if you are going into the film thinking that in any serious war movie, you're a total idiot anyway).  THere is nothing but struggle, desperation, care, but ultimately these types of things can only get you so far in a war torn society.  Ultimately, it's the well drawn out characters, the environment's reaction, and relationships that make this film shattering.  The animation and filmmaking is utterly amazing in bringing this to life in this regard. .I will not lie.  This isn't my favorite war movie of all time, nor is it even in my top ten.  I do feel that this movie is not as entertaining as Inglorious Basterds (one of my all time favorites, as a matter of fact), but quite frankly, this movie shouldn't offer entertainment value.  It doesn't do that, BUT, however, it is a wonderful, profound, and very shattering film.  The hype for this movie is sometimes seems it could burst into flames any second, but frankly, I think the glowing reviews are pretty justified.  I have really nothing else to say here.  If you are into war films and haven't seen this, pry yourself away from When Trumpets Fade and Cross of Iron (two massively overrated war movies in my opinion) RIGHT NOW.  And see this film.  You won't regret it.PS Please, if any of you ""adults"" in any way dismiss this film because it's an anime, please, do us a favor and shut up.  You'll just annoy everybody with your immature, ignorant blathering.

183328,A2G0WJZ9Q7YU0Y,156219464X,"professional_shizoku ""Waltz_4_Zizi""","[19, 21]","Studio Ghibli is a name that is synonymous with words like, ""beautiful,"" ""creative,"" ""magical"" and ""inventive.""  The popular Japanese animation studio has put forth works such as, ""Kiki's Delivery Service,"" ""Princess Mononoke,"" ""Laputa: Castle in the Sky,"" ""My Neighbor Totoro"" and their latest work to be released in America, ""Spirited Away.""  However, perhaps the most well-known (in teachers circles anyway), is Isao Takahata's 1988 masterpiece ""Grave of the Fireflies.""""Grave of the Fireflies"" takes place in Japan during World War II, during the last weeks of the war.  Brother and sister, Seita and Setsuko, lose their mother during an air raid due to severe bodily burns.  They are then forced to live with an aunt who is uncompassionate and ignorant to their situation.  Here we begin to see the sad and slow deterioration of their circumstances.Their aunt doesn't feel that the siblings have earned their stay at her home; in fact on the first night there she doesn't even feed them.  When they trade their dead mothers' kimonos for rice (a valuable commodity), she gives half to them while keeping the rest for her family and herself.  She even uses up most of the supplies that Seita brings from his old home, claiming that Seita and Setsuko are ungrateful ""brats.""It is at this point that Seita feels it is time to leave, so he moves Setsuko and himself from the house to an old bomb-shelter nearby.  Here they try to make a home; living near a pond that is lit at night by the glow of fireflies.Perhaps the most powerful aspect of this movie is that of human circumstance, and animation is the greatest medium for articulating this.  No fancy lights.  No special effects.  There are only a pen and pencil between the writers visions and the screen.  It is because of the animation that the true essence of the film is allowed to shine.  Takahata is able to build the characters, Seita and Setsuko, up using ""little"" scenes that are usually cut out of a big-production film.  By utilizing these scenes Takahata makes the characters more ""human,"" and therefore more capable of re- and obtaining human emotions.There are many underlying themes in ""Grave of the Fireflies.""  Most of them are symbolically embedded in objects, emotions, and events throughout the film.  But these are the ones I find most predominant.First off is that of the tin can containing the fruit drops.  Almost every time the young Setsuko cries, Seita is able to calm her by giving her a fruit drop.  The fruit drops hereby abilitating him to comfort her without using the emotion of comfort.  Towards the end of the movie, Setsuko begins to fall under the whimsy of malnutrition; which is reflected through her spreading rashes and diarrhea.  Little by little, Seita runs out of fruit drops to give her, and by the end of the movie Setsuko begins to suck on marbles.  It is only then that Seita begins to realize that he should have invested emotions not ""fruit drops"" towards Setsuko's problems.Secondly and the most importantly is that of ignorance.  In ""Grave of the Fireflies"" we find that the siblings are put into a situation; one that is not uncommon in the world today.  Millions of children are left starving and alone, without parents to care for them.  Isao Takahata has simply given us a different standpoint to observe the problem of ignorance from.  This ""ignorance"" of which I speak is violently evident throughout the movie.  First, is that of Seita's fantasy that Setsuko and he are living well off; until the end of the movie.  Second, is that of the aunt's ignorance and illcompassion for the sibling duo; if she had shown more compassion Seita and Setsuko would, most likely, never have moved into the bomb shelter where they met their early graves.  Also, there is a scene in the beginning in which the people of the subway in which Seita is sitting pass him by while uttering uncompassionate comments under their breaths . . .""These bums are a disgrace. . .""And this leads me to the movies' message that seems to be more of a question.  What can we do as a society to prevent these types of situations in which young children die?  With the use of the movie, Isao Takahata has shown us that children die as a result of ignorance.  Leaving us with one undeniable conclusion that if we have not learned that from this movie, then we have not understood our own selves.There is one particular scene in the movie in which Seita catches a firefly and gives it to Setsuko who consequently ""catches"" it to hard and squashes it.  Seita playfully responds, ""You gotta be more gentle."" Our lives are like that of the fireflies; they flicker for a brief moment then go as easily and quietly as they came.  If were not gentle enough they'll never get their chance to shineSPOILER ALERT:At the very end of the movie what may be called the spirits of Seita and a sleepy Setsuko look out over a modern and vitalized city.  But a question lingers in Seitas' eyes, ""will anyone help us?""A good question Mr. Takahata . . . a good question . . .",5,&quot;Why do fireflies have to die so soon?&quot;,1072051200,"12 22, 2003",2003,5033,"['Studio', 'Ghibli', 'name', 'synonymous', 'words', 'beautiful', 'creative', 'magical', 'inventive', 'popular', 'Japanese', 'animation', 'studio', 'put', 'forth', 'works', 'such', 'Kiki', 'Delivery', 'Service', 'Princess', 'Mononoke', 'Laputa', 'Castle', 'Sky', 'Neighbor', 'Totoro', 'latest', 'work', 'be', 'released', 'America', 'Spirited', 'Away', 'However', 'perhaps', 'most', 'well-known', 'teachers', 'circles', 'anyway', 'Isao', 'Takahata', '1988', 'masterpiece', 'Grave', 'Fireflies', 'Grave', 'Fireflies', 'place', 'Japan', 'World', 'War', 'II', 'last', 'weeks', 'war', 'Brother', 'sister', 'Seita', 'Setsuko', 'lose', 'mother', 'air', 'raid', 'due', 'severe', 'bodily', 'burns', 'are', 'then', 'forced', 'live', 'aunt', 'who', 'uncompassionate', 'ignorant', 'situation', 'Here', 'begin', 'see', 'sad', 'slow', 'deterioration', 'circumstances.Their', 'aunt', ""n't"", 'feel', 'siblings', 'have', 'earned', 'stay', 'home', 'fact', 'first', 'night', 'there', ""n't"", 'even', 'feed', 'When', 'trade', 'dead', 'mothers', 'kimonos', 'rice', 'valuable', 'commodity', 'half', 'keeping', 'rest', 'family', 'even', 'up', 'most', 'supplies', 'Seita', 'old', 'home', 'claiming', 'Seita', 'Setsuko', 'are', 'ungrateful', 'brats', 'point', 'Seita', 'time', 'leave', 'Setsuko', 'house', 'old', 'bomb-shelter', 'nearby', 'Here', 'try', 'make', 'home', 'living', 'pond', 'lit', 'night', 'glow', 'fireflies.Perhaps', 'most', 'powerful', 'aspect', 'movie', 'human', 'circumstance', 'animation', 'greatest', 'medium', 'articulating', 'fancy', 'lights', 'special', 'effects', 'are', 'only', 'pen', 'pencil', 'writers', 'visions', 'screen', 'animation', 'true', 'essence', 'film', 'allowed', 'shine', 'Takahata', 'able', 'build', 'characters', 'Seita', 'Setsuko', 'up', 'using', 'little', 'scenes', 'are', 'usually', 'cut', 'out', 'big-production', 'film', 'utilizing', 'scenes', 'Takahata', 'characters', 'more', 'human', 'therefore', 'more', 'capable', 're-', 'obtaining', 'human', 'are', 'many', 'underlying', 'themes', 'Grave', 'Fireflies', 'Most', 'are', 'symbolically', 'embedded', 'objects', 'emotions', 'events', 'film', 'are', 'ones', 'find', 'most', 'predominant.First', 'off', 'tin', 'can', 'containing', 'fruit', 'drops', 'time', 'young', 'Setsuko', 'cries', 'Seita', 'able', 'calm', 'giving', 'fruit', 'drop', 'fruit', 'hereby', 'abilitating', 'comfort', 'using', 'emotion', 'comfort', 'end', 'movie', 'Setsuko', 'fall', 'whimsy', 'malnutrition', 'reflected', 'spreading', 'rashes', 'diarrhea', 'Little', 'little', 'Seita', 'fruit', 'drops', 'give', 'end', 'movie', 'Setsuko', 'suck', 'marbles', 'only', 'then', 'Seita', 'realize', 'should', 'have', 'invested', 'emotions', 'not', 'fruit', 'drops', 'towards', 'Setsuko', 'problems.Secondly', 'most', 'importantly', 'ignorance', 'Grave', 'Fireflies', 'find', 'siblings', 'are', 'put', 'situation', 'one', 'not', 'uncommon', 'world', 'today', 'Millions', 'children', 'are', 'left', 'starving', 'alone', 'parents', 'care', 'Isao', 'Takahata', 'simply', 'given', 'different', 'standpoint', 'observe', 'problem', 'ignorance', 'ignorance', 'speak', 'violently', 'evident', 'movie', 'First', 'Seita', 'fantasy', 'Setsuko', 'are', 'living', 'well', 'end', 'movie', 'Second', 'aunt', 'ignorance', 'illcompassion', 'sibling', 'duo', 'had', 'shown', 'more', 'compassion', 'Seita', 'Setsuko', 'would', 'most', 'likely', 'never', 'have', 'moved', 'bomb', 'shelter', 'where', 'met', 'early', 'graves', 'Also', 'scene', 'beginning', 'people', 'subway', 'Seita', 'sitting', 'pass', 'uttering', 'uncompassionate', 'comments', 'breaths', 'bums', 'are', 'disgrace', 'movies', 'message', 'be', 'more', 'question', 'What', 'can', 'do', 'society', 'prevent', 'types', 'situations', 'young', 'children', 'die', 'use', 'movie', 'Isao', 'Takahata', 'shown', 'children', 'die', 'result', 'ignorance', 'Leaving', 'one', 'undeniable', 'conclusion', 'have', 'not', 'learned', 'movie', 'then', 'have', 'not', 'understood', 'own', 'selves.There', 'one', 'particular', 'scene', 'movie', 'Seita', 'firefly', 'Setsuko', 'who', 'consequently', 'catches', 'hard', 'squashes', 'Seita', 'playfully', 'got', 'ta', 'be', 'more', 'gentle', 'lives', 'are', 'fireflies', 'flicker', 'brief', 'moment', 'then', 'go', 'easily', 'quietly', 'came', 'were', 'not', 'gentle', 'enough', ""'ll"", 'never', 'get', 'chance', 'shineSPOILER', 'ALERT', 'very', 'end', 'movie', 'what', 'may', 'be', 'called', 'spirits', 'Seita', 'sleepy', 'Setsuko', 'look', 'out', 'modern', 'vitalized', 'city', 'question', 'lingers', 'Seitas', 'eyes', 'will', 'anyone', 'help', 'good', 'question', 'Mr.', 'Takahata', 'good', 'question']",N/A

Rarely do we get to see an animated movie that is so real and painful, down to Earth filled with truth. `Grave of the Fireflies' succeeds in drawing a more mature audience to watching animated (anime) movies rather than the young ones.The story mainly revolves around two children, Seita and his younger sister Setsuko; how they become homeless during World War II, how they feel dejected from their only living relations, to how they survive and stick with one another.The way in which the story is told is marvelous. Gradually, we see the two main characters succumb to the harshness of life, and trying to carry on. The animation for this movie is, without a doubt, wonderful. To move the audience by showing them this animated film proves that the people behind this masterpiece did an excellent job. The people who did the English translation for the characters also did a good job.Furthermore, this movie really makes us think about our own life, how perfect it is compared to the characters in this film, and how we should appreciate it more often. That is probably the most valuable moral that hit me while I was watching this movie. Besides, it is based on a true story of Akiyuki Nosaka, when he lost his own sister during the war, and blamed himself for it. Therefore, this movie mainly made me appreciate life for all the good qualities, even though the movie portrayed a very painful version of it.This movie has no happy beginning, and no happy ending, with a lot of ups and downs in between.

DelParto ""Rose2""","[2, 2]","Grave of the Fireflies of one of the most moving films in the form of Japanese animation that depicts one of the most important parts of the War in the Pacific that greatly evokes a tremendous affect on the emotions.  The interesting story behind coming across the film occurred during one class session where I had been teaching the evening's topic of the day, the history of Japan and the interpretation of how war was translated through political cartoons.  Having heard several students' suggestions, commentaries, and recommendations about Grave of the Fireflies, they indeed, were extremely correct to say that it falls under the category of being poignant.Although the film is animated, the storyline and most of all, the history of Japan during this pinnacle part of World War II glares enormously and shows the other side of the war through the eyes of those who did not fight it, but rather the Japanese civilians who had been greatly affected by the war experience within their homeland.  The story is based on the autobiographical novel by Akiyuki Nosaka and centers upon a brother Seita and his sister Setsuko who become orphans after their village experiences endless destruction.  By viewing the opening scenes of the film that take place after the Japanese surrender in the city of Kobe and the moment Seita comes on the screen and the flash of fireflies show a symbolic menagerie of he and his sister, immediately, viewers may get a gut reaction filled with emotions.  As one watches each scene, several major themes will arise that deal with survival, suffering, and humanity.And after viewing the film, one may have more questions to ask or add another perception of how war affects those involved.  And like my students, I, too, agree that the film is another form of how history is narrated and told, and is recommended for those who are curious about the War in Asia from this particular perspective that may have been overlooked or not considered.",5,A unique interpretation of history,1293926400,"01 2, 2011",2011,1970,"['Grave', 'Fireflies', 'one', 'most', 'moving', 'films', 'form', 'Japanese', 'animation', 'one', 'most', 'important', 'parts', 'War', 'Pacific', 'greatly', 'tremendous', 'affect', 'emotions', 'interesting', 'story', 'coming', 'film', 'occurred', 'one', 'class', 'session', 'where', 'had', 'been', 'teaching', 'evening', 'topic', 'day', 'history', 'Japan', 'interpretation', 'how', 'war', 'was', 'translated', 'political', 'cartoons', 'Having', 'heard', 'several', 'students', 'suggestions', 'commentaries', 'recommendations', 'Grave', 'Fireflies', 'indeed', 'were', 'extremely', 'correct', 'say', 'category', 'being', 'film', 'animated', 'storyline', 'most', 'history', 'Japan', 'pinnacle', 'part', 'World', 'War', 'II', 'enormously', 'other', 'side', 'war', 'eyes', 'who', 'did', 'not', 'fight', 'rather', 'Japanese', 'civilians', 'who', 'had', 'been', 'greatly', 'affected', 'war', 'experience', 'homeland', 'story', 'based', 'autobiographical', 'novel', 'Akiyuki', 'Nosaka', 'centers', 'brother', 'Seita', 'sister', 'Setsuko', 'who', 'become', 'orphans', 'village', 'experiences', 'endless', 'destruction', 'viewing', 'opening', 'scenes', 'film', 'take', 'place', 'Japanese', 'surrender', 'city', 'Kobe', 'moment', 'Seita', 'screen', 'flash', 'fireflies', 'show', 'symbolic', 'menagerie', 'sister', 'immediately', 'viewers', 'may', 'get', 'gut', 'reaction', 'filled', 'emotions', 'one', 'scene', 'several', 'major', 'themes', 'will', 'arise', 'deal', 'survival', 'suffering', 'humanity.And', 'viewing', 'film', 'one', 'may', 'have', 'more', 'questions', 'ask', 'add', 'perception', 'how', 'war', 'involved', 'students', 'too', 'agree', 'film', 'form', 'how', 'history', 'narrated', 'told', 'recommended', 'who', 'are', 'curious', 'War', 'Asia', 'particular', 'perspective', 'may', 'have', 'been', 'overlooked', 'not', 'considered']",N/A

With their father away on the front and their mother killed in an air raid, these two young orphans are forced to look after themselves.  Their close relatives are too absorbed to look after themselves and their own families to care enough about feeding two more children.  So these two young ones are doing everything they can within their power in order to survive.  They create their own home in the abandoned shelter and they feed on rice and frogs.  Their unconditional love for each other is very touching.  In between bombings and air raids, they are just being kids:  playing with each other, catching fireflies, swimming in the ocean and picking flowers.  It is each other's company that keeps them hopeful about their future.  But war has no mercy and as in this story, it collects its wants in young innocent lives.  It is hearbreaking to learn these children's fate.  While this is animated film, I would be careful what age of children should watch it.  It depicts death, indifference of adults towards each other and children during the time of war and hardship during wartime no child should ever learn on his own.

183340,A2EDZH51XHFA9B,156219464X,"Robert Beveridge ""xterminal""","[4, 6]","Grave of the Fireflies (Isao Takahata, 1988)There are nine animated films on IMDB's top 250 of all time list (as of this writing). As one can surmise with a little reflection, the majority of them are new releases that have gotten, perhaps, an overenthusiastic response (this is also true of live-action films; Pirates of the Caribbean, of all things, is swimming around in the lower ranks as I type this). It takes a true classic to stay in the list if it's over ten years old. When you narrow it down like that, only three films remain. Two are Disney's Beauty and the Beast and Fantasia. The third is Grave of the Fireflies.Takahata's tale follows a young brother and sister, Seita and Setsuko, through the last days of World War II. During an air raid, they're separated from their mother (their father is serving in the Imperial Navy), who is injured when her shelter is bombed. She ultimately perishes, and with their mother dead and their father off fighting the war, Seita and Setsuko are forced to make their way as best they can, scrabbling for what little food they can find and having only each other for solace.From the very first scene, it's easy to tell that Grave of the Fireflies is not your usual animated film, of either the Japanese (big robots battling one another, big-breasted bimbos having fun, or a combination of both) or American (standard, usually brainless, kid stuff) fare. For that matter, it's not the nonstandard fare (American Pop, Fritz the Cat) that pops up every once in a while. It's something completely different; a tense, devastating drama told in animation, perhaps simply because a live action film couldn't portray the devastation of the last few days before Japan surrendered with quite the same empty hopelessness as does the stark, beautiful animation with which we are presented here.Grab a box of Kleenex before watching this film.

As someone pointed out before, this isn't a movie that you'll want to watch everyday. The depressing reality of the two main characters', young children, fates will make you feel terrible.During the course of the movie, Setsuko and Seita have a few moments of hapiness which never really seem that bright since you already learn of their demise at the beginning of the film. This is something which I didn't expect out of Studio Ghibli; heck, I didn't even see the traditional blue Totoro logo at the start of the film! Either way, there's always a lingering bit of negativity throughout this movie, but then again, whenever war occurs, there will always be death to follow.This new DVD release of Grave of the Firelies has 2 discs; one with the film and some bonus features, and the other with more bonus features and storyboarded scenes that didn't make it into the final cut of the movie. Of most interest here would probably be the COMPLETE storyboards and the Roger Ebert segment on disc 1. Ebert also brings to light some good reasons why this film probably wouldn't be better if it were live action.Plus, there's an interesting interview with the Director of Grave of the Fireflies, as he comments on how Hayao Miyazaki encouraged him while he made this movie. Well, if you've never seen this film before this would be a good DVD to pick up. (The 98' DVD release is poorer; much less features and its an un-anamorphic un-remastered widescreen) And if you have seen this, then it might be a good idea to get this DVD and show all your friends and family.

After repeated viewings, I still cry when Setsuko tries to give Seita her rice balls made out of mud, Setsuko's funeral, and the very end.Like most other anime movies, it is far superior in its subtitled form, although the scenes with no dialogue (the opening, memories of Setsuko, and the very end) are the most powerful.

Even one of my best friends who's basically the most levelheaded girl I know told me she broke down in tears when watching it. And trust me she's a tough chick.What we're dealing with his is a war movie. Set during WO II. That's where the cliches stop.  Apart from the few scenes of American planes dropping fire-bombs on Kobe, the movie tells the story of Seita(a 14 year old boy) and Setsuko(his 4 year old sister)*spoilers*Their father is fighting for Japan in the navy.During a bombardment their mother gets injured and dies in the hospital.Now orphaned Seita and Sutsuko seek refuge with their aunt. While at first this is a solution, the aunt quickly grows weary of Setsuko crying for her mother in the middle of the night and the need for extra food that is required to feed her and her brother. After so many arguments Seita decides to leave and seeks shelter in an abbandoned bombshelter... They make a nice home for themselves there and are reasonably happy. That is until food supplies start to run out. This is the beginning of the end...I will not lie.. This is not a happy movie. Far from it.

The movie tells the story of two orphaned children who have to stand on their own after losing their parents during the war.Where to begin? Being a movie from Studio Ghibli the quality in animation is guaranteed, what makes this movie so compelling is the drama and the tragic turn of events in the lives of these two kids. The movie opens with the family running from a raid in their town, planes are passing by bombing and shooting at people. From there, the lives of these kids change dramatically, the situation of the war is not the only thing they have to deal with but relatives that help them more for obligation than wanting to do it, the indifference of the people of the town and the difficulty of getting something as basic as water and food during war times.The main characters are well defined from the very beginning and the two siblings will make you cry a couple of times during the movie, the story is well adapted from the book and it perfectly demonstrates its point. You get to see how gradually their innocence is lost due the circumstances they had to live in, they have to suffer some horrible tests in moments that can be defined only as heartbreaking. The movie has hardly any music at all, but the more dramatic moments of the film are accompanied by a score that could not have fit better (sadly, the music writer doesn't get his credit on the American version of the DVD)The extras offered in this edition might not be many, but the movie itself is a perfect excuse for buying this DVD. The only extras worth mentioning are the storyboards for the entire film included here. The sound mixing is pretty decent, you can watch the movie dubbed in English or in Japanese with subtitles in English; audio options are 5.1 Dolby digital stereo for both languages.

The story is partially based on the autobiography of Nosaka Akiyuki. Produced by Studio Ghibli, ""Grave of the Fireflies"" follows the wartime journey of Seita and Setsuko, brother and sister, as they struggle to survive in postwar Kobe.The film begins with a voiceover by an eerie red spirit, and the sense of melancholy and foreboding continues throughout the film. The firebombing of Kobe is awesome to behold in its absolute destruction and scale; we see the wooden buildings burn like matchsticks. Ash and debris choke the air as more of the firebombs fall from the sky like clusters of bright flowers before they explode into fireballs that are all-consuming. Seita grabs Setsuko and runs through the blazing streets. The children do find their mother at a nearby triage center set up in a school, but are forced to go live with a stingy aunt in the countryside, who constantly nags Seita to do more for the war effort. Seita and his sister eventually set off on their own, where they dream of happier days with their parents as food becomes more and more scarce.Although an animated film, this was the most powerful messenger of the horrors of war that I have ever experienced, as powerful as Schindler's List. Animation provides the means to portray the utter destruction with an objective, stylized eye; the charred bodies and burned-out shells of buildings, the horribly burned and maimed victims, the striking contrast of the soft green luxuriousness of the Japanese countryside, with its rice paddies and traditional architecture. There is an amazing attention to detail, from the prints of kimonos to the detailed porcelain rice bowls, that makes the animation incredibly lifelike, and at the same time, free from constraints of traditional filmmaking. The film captures humanity on a grand scale: the tearful reuniting of a mother and daughter at a local train station even as Seita must deceive Setsuko that their parents will come along soon to collect them, Seita's beating at the hands of a local farmer, the glad homecoming of affluent daughters across a valley where Seita is weighed down by grief and destitution, and Seita's tender care of his weakened little sister, with her sunny smiles and childhood innocence even at the darkest moments.Although animated, this is clearly a film for adults and teenagers, not children. The level of violence (in the firebombing raids and beatings) and tragedy makes this too overwhelming for young children, but for the rest of us, it is a powerful reminder of the horrors of war and the power of love. A masterpiece of filmmaking in any medium, and one of the most gripping, brutally honest portrayals of the toll of modern warfare on the most vulnerable: the children.",5,Haunting masterpiece of the human cost of war,1140652800,"02 23, 2006",2006,2856,"['Hotaru', 'haka', 'Grave', 'Fireflies', 'was', 'directed', 'Takahata', 'Isao', 'longtime', 'colleague', 'collaborator', 'Miyazaki', 'Hayao', 'story', 'partially', 'based', 'autobiography', 'Nosaka', 'Akiyuki', 'Produced', 'Studio', 'Ghibli', 'Grave', 'Fireflies', 'wartime', 'journey', 'Seita', 'Setsuko', 'brother', 'sister', 'struggle', 'survive', 'postwar', 'Kobe.The', 'film', 'voiceover', 'eerie', 'red', 'spirit', 'sense', 'melancholy', 'foreboding', 'film', 'firebombing', 'Kobe', 'awesome', 'behold', 'absolute', 'destruction', 'scale', 'see', 'wooden', 'buildings', 'burn', 'matchsticks', 'Ash', 'debris', 'choke', 'air', 'more', 'firebombs', 'fall', 'sky', 'clusters', 'bright', 'flowers', 'explode', 'fireballs', 'are', 'all-consuming', 'Seita', 'grabs', 'Setsuko', 'blazing', 'streets', 'children', 'do', 'find', 'mother', 'nearby', 'triage', 'center', 'set', 'up', 'school', 'are', 'forced', 'go', 'live', 'stingy', 'aunt', 'countryside', 'who', 'constantly', 'Seita', 'do', 'more', 'war', 'effort', 'Seita', 'sister', 'eventually', 'set', 'off', 'own', 'where', 'dream', 'happier', 'days', 'parents', 'food', 'more', 'more', 'animated', 'film', 'was', 'most', 'powerful', 'messenger', 'horrors', 'war', 'have', 'ever', 'experienced', 'as', 'powerful', 'Schindler', 'List', 'Animation', 'means', 'portray', 'utter', 'destruction', 'objective', 'stylized', 'eye', 'charred', 'bodies', 'burned-out', 'shells', 'buildings', 'horribly', 'burned', 'maimed', 'victims', 'striking', 'contrast', 'soft', 'green', 'luxuriousness', 'Japanese', 'countryside', 'rice', 'paddies', 'traditional', 'architecture', 'amazing', 'attention', 'detail', 'prints', 'kimonos', 'detailed', 'porcelain', 'rice', 'bowls', 'animation', 'incredibly', 'lifelike', 'same', 'time', 'free', 'constraints', 'traditional', 'filmmaking', 'film', 'humanity', 'grand', 'scale', 'tearful', 'reuniting', 'mother', 'daughter', 'local', 'train', 'station', 'even', 'Seita', 'must', 'deceive', 'Setsuko', 'parents', 'will', 'come', 'along', 'soon', 'collect', 'Seita', 'beating', 'hands', 'local', 'farmer', 'glad', 'homecoming', 'affluent', 'daughters', 'valley', 'where', 'Seita', 'weighed', 'down', 'grief', 'destitution', 'Seita', 'tender', 'care', 'weakened', 'little', 'sister', 'sunny', 'smiles', 'childhood', 'innocence', 'even', 'darkest', 'moments.Although', 'animated', 'clearly', 'film', 'adults', 'teenagers', 'not', 'children', 'level', 'violence', 'firebombing', 'raids', 'beatings', 'tragedy', 'too', 'overwhelming', 'young', 'children', 'rest', 'powerful', 'reminder', 'horrors', 'war', 'power', 'love', 'masterpiece', 'filmmaking', 'medium', 'one', 'most', 'gripping', 'brutally', 'honest', 'portrayals', 'toll', 'modern', 'warfare', 'most', 'vulnerable', 'children']",N/A
183354,A1UWH45STSX416,156219464X,S. Bilby,"[3, 4]","Most of the reviews I have read here are spot on. However, the one thing I have not seen are two facts about the movie.First, this film was shown in Japan with &quot;My Neighbor Totoro&quot;, which is one of the sweetest, happiest movies I have ever seen. I am not sure in what order the double feature ran, but if &quot;Totoro&quot; was run first, it would be emotionally devistating to watch &quot;Fireflies&quot;.Second the use of color in this film is unusual. The colors are extremely muted. Even the skin tones are beige and not the rosy glow one sees in Mei from &quot;Totoro&quot; or Sheeta from &quot;Castle in the Sky&quot; (also from Studio Ghibli). Like a song written in a flat key, the colors give &quot;Fireflies&quot; a note of sadness that one cannot pinpoint. It is brilliant!Having six and four year old daughters, I would not suggest that young children view the film. Preteens can get the message.

Maybe that is why in my mind I had classified the genre as one that is based mainly on action, usually involving swords or guns and vast amounts of blood. This is one of the main reasons why my curiosity was highly piqued when people recommended this movie to me and I read about its topic. After watching it I was instantly convinced that I had just experienced one of the most successful attempts at conveying the consequences war has on innocent people. In this case the effect is magnified by the fact that the sufferers are children.In the year 1945, close to the end of World War II, Japan is being bombarded through air raids. A young boy named Senta and his little sister, Setsuko, have to run to the shelter and in the process they get separated from their mother. When they finally find her again she is seriously injured and does not last long in her attempts at survival. Now the kids only have an aunt to support them and guide them through the turmoil. But the grownup performs this task with little enthusiasm, so the children are basically left to survive by themselves. That is when we get to see the power of love between the siblings, and the contrast with the disinterest of the rest of the people in the village regarding the well-being of the kids.I am sure that this is one of the great masterpieces of the genre, since it presents a whole array of emotions, running from despair to hope without limits, through its excellent script and crafty graphics. In my case it will probably serve as a benchmark to rate all other future anime dramas in the future.

Firstly for it's has masterly and stunningly beautiful animation and artistic quality which, while a signature feature of the studio Ghibli of Japan, is so outstanding it could draw you in to the film in a spellbinding manner in it's own right.That said it is undoubtedly the moving and tender story here that is the the pull, a tale of the struggle to survive the ravages of war. It is based upon the autobiographical work of the Japanese Author Akiyuki Nosaka. Written as an intended apology to the little sister he lost at the end of WW2.The principal characters are Seito ans Setsuko, a teenage boy and his young sister who are sent to live with a distant Aunt following the death of their Mother in an air raid on Kobe.Their Father is away at war in Japenese Navy. Their Aunt is not merely a distant relative but distant emotionally,a complaining, cold and intolerant woman and ultimately Seito has to make a decision about how the two children can survive the war, either with bodily sustinance and cruel humanity or chancing their luck in order to maintian a environment of humanity in which he knows his sister will best flourish, a legacy to his lost or absent parents.The two move into an unused air raid shelter, besides a stream and amidst an abundance of nature; on the outskirts of town.All at first, is rich and freeing to the spirits of the children.Both gain a renewed sense of strength from the beauty that surrounds them, they use fireflies to light their dark shelter by night but the agony of the death each morning of hundreds of these enchanting creatures does not escape their notice and both seem acutely aware of their own lives running in parrallel.Little Setsuko ritually buries the creatures each day in grateful and polite homage, perhaps also hopng in doing so she and her Brother will spared a simlair fate.Will they survive in unending joy or will the impact of war and scant food and trading power force them to face a similair fate to the beautifully free but short lived creatures?The story is so grippuing and moving, it speaks of the will to keep alive all that is beautiful as well as mundane and ordinary about the human experience and it starkly examines the futility and impact of war. The loss, the change in humanity and reason and the focus on the importance of the small but nurturing elements of life.

Taking place in Japan during the latter parts of World War II (though it could be any country in any war), it's the story of two children, Seita and Setsuko, who are left on their own when their mother dies in the destruction of a small town, and are left to attempt to survive on their own.  Seita, the brother, is the older of the two and it falls to him to guard and care for his sister Setsuko, who's little more than a toddler.  The two  hold out hope that their father, a member of the Japanese navy, will eventually return for them.  Seita and Setsuko are wonderful and captivating characters who seem uncannily real, making their plight all the more terrifying and heartbreaking.What's perhaps most horrifying about the whole experience is not just the brutalities of war, because that was to be expected; but the terribly callous nature of many of the 'ordinary people' the children encounter during their ordeal.  During the darkest days of the war, when logically one would think the survivors would be pulling together, the case was often anything but.  Even the family of Setsuko and Seita's mother does not want to be 'burdened' with them.  Although examples of people who react differently do crop up later, for the bulk of the time the children are on their own as ruin befalls the world around them.  The children, and the fireflies that Setsuko finds, and keeps in a jar, talking to them and feeding them, and releasing them at night to fly about the makeshift shelter Seita has constructed.  Abandoned by humanity, the little glowing insects are the only living creatures the children find companionship with.There are bright and tender, even humorous, moments amidst the tragedy - some of them are overt, others occur in places where the meaning is subject to interpretation.  But it remains a harrowing movie, one of the most crushing ever made.  Extremely haunting, extremely powerful, and, in an odd way, extremely rewarding.  There are glimmers and whispers of possibility flitting, firefly-like, through the darkness, and the effect is truly eerie.  I'll refrain from hinting at the ending, but there are certainly a host of moments that sear themselves into one's heart.

My Neighbor Totoro was the other film, and it's possibly the most uplifting film in my collection. In contrast, Grave of the Fireflies is the saddest. I'll try to explain why.Both films feature girls who are four years old and both are utterly adorable. Takahata and Hayao Miyazaki seem to know exactly how to capture the innocence, curiosity, trust and unconditional love that a young child gives its parents and older siblings.Grave of the Fireflies is set in Japan during World War II. Unlike most war films, the story is not too concerned with the actual war itself or any of the battles. This is a film about the effects of war. Don't assume that it is aimed at children just because it's animated; it's clearly aimed at an older audience. The opening scene gives an indication of what to expect when we hear Seita's (Spencer) narration and find out that this is the day that he dies. After his death, we see his spirit reunited with that of his little sister, Setsuko (Chrosite). This is not a spoiler. It happens three minutes into the film and everything else is told through the use of flashback. We know right away that the children will die.It's impossible to discuss the film properly without including spoilers, so be warned.Seita is about 14 years old and is responsible for looking after his sister when their mother is hospitalized. Conditions are awful and the mother dies fairly quickly. Their father is away fighting in the war and possibly dead, so Seita takes his sister to live with an aunt. Unfortunately, they aren't welcome guests because the aunt feels that they contribute nothing. As a result, Seita leaves with Setsuko and decides that they will live in a cave near the beach.Everything is fine for a while, but the situation in Japan means that very little food is available. The two thrive in each other's company, but it's difficult to stay healthy when you don't have enough to eat. The film doesn't push its message continually, but we see sores develop on the backs of the children as they are wading in the ocean. They are developing malnutrition.Why am I recommending such a depressing story?There is great beauty in the film. I particularly love seeing Seita's inadequate attempts to make Setsuko happy and care for her. She trusts him unconditionally throughout the story. When he mentions that they need money, she produces a little purse and offers what she has. She's happy at the smallest little things such as the taste of her favorite fruit drops or the light of the fireflies in the cave. It's heartbreaking to see her become ill and watch her eventual demise. Her final words will always haunt me, and Seita's simple declaration which follows.One of the most touching scenes is a flashback within a flashback, showing how she liked to play outside the cave. If you have seen the film, you'll probably feel the same way.Grave of the Fireflies is an important anti-war film. The story is partially true and is based on the author's failure to keep his own sister safe during the war. So, thinking back to my opening comments, the scene three minutes into the film when their spirits are reunited is incredibly beautiful and uplifting once you realize how pure their relationship was. It's worth seeing that scene again after watching the film in order to fully appreciate its beauty.Takahata's depiction of Setsuko and Miyazaki's depiction of Mei in My Neighbor Totoro have given us two animated children that we will never forget. The images are so powerful that the films might even encourage you to treat your own siblings differently. It's easy to take things for granted in life. I live in North America and have never really wanted for anything. My life isn't in danger. Films like Grave of the Fireflies help remind me to appreciate the simple joy of living and the freedom to do so in peace.Mere words aren't sufficient to describe the power and beauty of Grave of the Fireflies. You really have to see it for yourself.",5,"Animated, but not for children",1303689600,"04 25, 2011",2011,4378,"['Grave', 'Fireflies', '1988', 'Animation', 'Drama', 'War', '89', 'minutesDirected', 'Isao', 'TakahataStarring', 'voices', 'Rhoda', 'Chrosite', 'J.', 'Robert', 'Spencer', 'English', 'version', 'How', 'can', 'possibly', 'do', 'film', 'justice', ""'m"", 'almost', 'tears', 'just', 'thinking', 'what', 'am', 'going', 'write', 'film', 'was', 'released', 'Japan', 'part', 'same', 'double', 'bill', 'have', 'claims', 'being', 'best', 'Studio', 'Ghibli', 'thus', 'far', 'Neighbor', 'Totoro', 'was', 'other', 'film', 'possibly', 'most', 'uplifting', 'film', 'collection', 'contrast', 'Grave', 'Fireflies', 'saddest', ""'ll"", 'try', 'explain', 'why.Both', 'films', 'feature', 'girls', 'who', 'are', 'four', 'years', 'old', 'are', 'utterly', 'adorable', 'Takahata', 'Hayao', 'Miyazaki', 'seem', 'know', 'exactly', 'how', 'capture', 'innocence', 'curiosity', 'trust', 'unconditional', 'love', 'young', 'child', 'parents', 'older', 'siblings.Grave', 'Fireflies', 'set', 'Japan', 'World', 'War', 'II', 'most', 'war', 'films', 'story', 'not', 'too', 'concerned', 'actual', 'war', 'battles', 'film', 'effects', 'war', 'Do', ""n't"", 'assume', 'aimed', 'children', 'just', 'animated', 'clearly', 'aimed', 'older', 'audience', 'opening', 'scene', 'indication', 'what', 'expect', 'when', 'hear', 'Seita', 'Spencer', 'narration', 'find', 'out', 'day', 'death', 'see', 'spirit', 'reunited', 'little', 'sister', 'Setsuko', 'Chrosite', 'not', 'spoiler', 'three', 'minutes', 'film', 'everything', 'else', 'told', 'use', 'flashback', 'know', 'right', 'away', 'children', 'will', 'die.It', 'impossible', 'discuss', 'film', 'properly', 'including', 'spoilers', 'so', 'be', 'warned.Seita', '14', 'years', 'old', 'responsible', 'looking', 'sister', 'when', 'mother', 'hospitalized', 'Conditions', 'are', 'awful', 'mother', 'fairly', 'quickly', 'father', 'away', 'fighting', 'war', 'possibly', 'dead', 'so', 'Seita', 'sister', 'live', 'aunt', 'Unfortunately', 'are', ""n't"", 'welcome', 'guests', 'aunt', 'feels', 'contribute', 'nothing', 'result', 'Seita', 'Setsuko', 'will', 'live', 'cave', 'beach.Everything', 'fine', 'while', 'situation', 'Japan', 'very', 'little', 'food', 'available', 'two', 'thrive', 'other', 'company', 'difficult', 'stay', 'healthy', 'when', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'enough', 'eat', 'film', ""n't"", 'push', 'message', 'continually', 'see', 'sores', 'develop', 'backs', 'children', 'are', 'wading', 'ocean', 'are', 'developing', 'am', 'recommending', 'such', 'depressing', 'story', 'great', 'beauty', 'film', 'particularly', 'love', 'seeing', 'Seita', 'inadequate', 'attempts', 'make', 'Setsuko', 'happy', 'care', 'unconditionally', 'story', 'When', 'need', 'money', 'little', 'purse', 'what', 'happy', 'smallest', 'little', 'things', 'such', 'taste', 'favorite', 'fruit', 'drops', 'light', 'fireflies', 'cave', 'heartbreaking', 'see', 'become', 'ill', 'watch', 'eventual', 'demise', 'final', 'words', 'will', 'always', 'haunt', 'Seita', 'simple', 'declaration', 'follows.One', 'most', 'touching', 'scenes', 'flashback', 'flashback', 'showing', 'how', 'liked', 'play', 'cave', 'have', 'seen', 'film', ""'ll"", 'probably', 'feel', 'same', 'way.Grave', 'Fireflies', 'important', 'anti-war', 'film', 'story', 'partially', 'true', 'based', 'author', 'failure', 'keep', 'own', 'sister', 'safe', 'war', 'So', 'thinking', 'back', 'opening', 'comments', 'scene', 'three', 'minutes', 'film', 'when', 'spirits', 'are', 'reunited', 'incredibly', 'beautiful', 'uplifting', 'once', 'realize', 'how', 'pure', 'relationship', 'was', 'worth', 'seeing', 'scene', 'again', 'watching', 'film', 'order', 'fully', 'appreciate', 'beauty.Takahata', 'depiction', 'Setsuko', 'Miyazaki', 'depiction', 'Mei', 'My', 'Neighbor', 'Totoro', 'have', 'given', 'two', 'animated', 'children', 'will', 'never', 'forget', 'images', 'are', 'so', 'powerful', 'films', 'might', 'even', 'encourage', 'treat', 'own', 'siblings', 'differently', 'easy', 'take', 'things', 'granted', 'life', 'live', 'North', 'America', 'have', 'never', 'really', 'wanted', 'anything', 'life', ""n't"", 'danger', 'Films', 'Grave', 'Fireflies', 'help', 'remind', 'appreciate', 'simple', 'joy', 'living', 'freedom', 'do', 'so', 'peace.Mere', 'words', 'are', ""n't"", 'sufficient', 'describe', 'power', 'beauty', 'Grave', 'Fireflies', 'really', 'have', 'see']",N/A

Such is the case during wartime. Pre-teenage Seita and his four year-old sister Setsuko, are orphaned in war-torn Japan when their mother is killed during an allied bombing raid. It makes no difference who started the war or why for the reality obscures reflection when the necessity for survival is paramount. Seita is old enough to comprehend their desperate situation and his responsibility to his sister as older brother. He struggles to maintain for her the illusion that everything is ok, supressing his own pain and torment for her sake, but as food becomes scarce, the reality becomes clear. GRAVE OF THE FIREFLIES is both beautiful in its portrayal of the magic of childhood and horrific with its images of destruction. There is a distance between the adult world that eschews childhood games and that of the children; helpless victims struggling to maintain sanity with the only weapon they possess: childhood.  There is a poignant and beautiful scene in the film where Seita catches enough fireflies to light the inside of their refuge and both children fall asleep as under a blanket of magical stars. In the morning all of the insects are dead, and Setsuku laments, ""Why must they die so quickly.""

183369,A3U56M0Y8LYO6J,156219464X,"Steven Y. ""Pop Culture Addict""","[4, 9]","Isao Takahata's ""Grave of the Fireflies"" is an animated feature with high aspirations. This is not the stuff of a coyote chasing a roadrunner or a semi-coherent dog and meddling kids solving mysteries. No, ""Grave of the Fireflies"" is a film about horror and suffering. It is a film about painful experiences and the need to let people know that such suffering actually took place and still takes place in certain corners of the world today.In the closing days of the second World War, American bombers are dropping napalm canisters on Japan.  Entire cities burn to the ground and helpless citizens are forced into the streets.  Two young children, Seita (voiced by Tsutomu Tatsumi) and his younger sister Setsuko (voiced by Ayano Shiraishi) are left to fend for themselves when they lose their home and their mother.  They find temporary shelter with an aunt, but the situation does not work out and soon the siblings are on the move once more.  Every passing day becomes a struggle for survival.""Grave of the Fireflies"" employs an Eastern narrative that dwells more on contemplation and consequences than dynamic action. The result is a film that is lush and beautiful in its visual poetry but which is sometimes too ponderous for its own good. There are lulls where the film seems to be running in place as certain sequences generate too much self reflection. Yet, in no way does this aspect of the film dull its emotional impact. This is a gut-wrenching film that will force people to reassess their preconceptions of animated features.

183372,A121WJCKYJ4T03,156219464X,taka(Japanese,"[1, 1]","I had wrote about the review of this movie already, however I write the new review because want to write for below one star review.Another review wrote ""Japan shade off their WW2 responsibility by releasing this movie"". I don't think so. This movie would be made on the different points to WW2 responsibilities. This movie was made on Akiyuki Nosaka's novel (the novel was almost non-fiction. he lost his sister to nutrition lack on WW2). Mr. Nosaka will have written this novel because he wanted to say Japan justify on WW2? I don't think so. He would want to appeal the peace without the war simply.As another reviewers say, Japan has had many problems after WW2. Yasukuni shrine problem is so, too. I can never believe about what Japanese prime minister Junichi Koizumi has visited to the shrine till now. Yasukuni shrine is different to general other Japanese shrines. The shrine was made for praising the war deads on WW2, that is, visiting the shrine is included the mean that the visitors justify the Japanese roles on WW2.When Japanese politians visit to Yasukuni, they often say ""the visit is private"". But I think that that it is only their excuse. Though there may be reviewers who think that many Japanese justify WW2, in fact I don't think so, if I say precisely, there are the gap between two generation in Japan, too. Many youth generation including me thinks that Japan should have the responsibility to WW2, on the other hand, the senior generation apt to justify the role. They may not want to admit because death of fellow soldiers is meaningless if they admit.I think so about Japanese WW2 compensation. Why don't Japanese politicians think about the compensations more? Especially about Asia. On the other hand, it is great act that Germany copes with the compensation positively. I think that the reason Japan don't cope will be connected with Japan political problems. The big party is Jimin party (liberal democratic party). Japan minister Koizumi is just from Jimin. Jimin is famous as the party that has sympatric thinking to WW2 Japan responsibility.Though Yasukuni and Japan compensation problems are so, finally people who appeal Japanese jusifice are Japanese politicians. That will be their benefits or honors. But I want you to know that there are many Japanese that should have the responsibilities as Japan. Nankin Slaughter is so. Japan should admit about the worst crime, and the compensation. I think that I can say the same thing about U.S.A, that is, the So,Zmu Slaughter of Vietnam War. I could not believe about what the some crimers were not blamed in U.S court. But as U.S.A standed for anti-war promotion on the opportunity, there are the thinking gap between politicians and general people in Japan.I want to say about Hiroshima and Nagasaki atomic bombs, Japan intended to win WW2 even if sacrificed all the nations as can understand if see Okinwa disaster lost Okinawa 1/3 nations. But there must be other means that could solve except of throwing atomic bombs. Atomic bomb is the most terrible means that lead human collapse on the both mean of mental and physical. Many Japanese girls committed suicide in pain by never-cured scars after atomic bombs, and many people have suffered for the fears of radioactive rays.I have written about many things of Japan and U.S.A, I think that may watch this movie on more simple eyes. by having sympathy for Setsuko and Seita who lost their life, we should have Peace and Love and Starvation and so on simply, deeply.Many sentences that I wrote have been the review over this movie,However in the mean of the peace, I dared to write about them.I'm sorry this poor sentence.",5,grave of the fireflies,1078876800,"03 10, 2004",2004,3661,"['had', 'wrote', 'review', 'movie', 'already', 'however', 'write', 'new', 'review', 'want', 'write', 'one', 'star', 'review.Another', 'review', 'wrote', 'Japan', 'shade', 'off', 'WW2', 'responsibility', 'releasing', 'movie', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'so', 'movie', 'would', 'be', 'made', 'different', 'points', 'WW2', 'responsibilities', 'movie', 'was', 'made', 'Akiyuki', 'Nosaka', 'novel', 'novel', 'was', 'almost', 'non-fiction', 'lost', 'sister', 'nutrition', 'lack', 'WW2', 'Mr.', 'Nosaka', 'will', 'have', 'written', 'novel', 'wanted', 'say', 'Japan', 'justify', 'WW2', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'so', 'would', 'want', 'appeal', 'peace', 'war', 'simply.As', 'reviewers', 'say', 'Japan', 'had', 'many', 'problems', 'WW2', 'Yasukuni', 'shrine', 'problem', 'so', 'too', 'can', 'never', 'believe', 'what', 'Japanese', 'prime', 'minister', 'Junichi', 'Koizumi', 'visited', 'shrine', 'till', 'now', 'Yasukuni', 'shrine', 'different', 'general', 'other', 'Japanese', 'shrines', 'shrine', 'was', 'made', 'praising', 'war', 'WW2', 'visiting', 'shrine', 'included', 'mean', 'visitors', 'justify', 'Japanese', 'roles', 'WW2.When', 'Japanese', 'politians', 'visit', 'Yasukuni', 'often', 'say', 'visit', 'private', 'think', 'only', 'excuse', 'may', 'be', 'reviewers', 'who', 'think', 'many', 'Japanese', 'justify', 'WW2', 'fact', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'so', 'say', 'precisely', 'are', 'gap', 'two', 'generation', 'Japan', 'too', 'Many', 'youth', 'generation', 'including', 'Japan', 'should', 'have', 'responsibility', 'WW2', 'other', 'hand', 'senior', 'generation', 'apt', 'justify', 'role', 'may', 'not', 'want', 'admit', 'death', 'fellow', 'soldiers', 'meaningless', 'admit.I', 'think', 'so', 'Japanese', 'WW2', 'compensation', 'Why', 'do', ""n't"", 'Japanese', 'politicians', 'think', 'compensations', 'more', 'Especially', 'Asia', 'other', 'hand', 'great', 'act', 'Germany', 'compensation', 'positively', 'think', 'reason', 'Japan', 'do', ""n't"", 'cope', 'will', 'be', 'connected', 'Japan', 'political', 'problems', 'big', 'party', 'Jimin', 'party', 'liberal', 'democratic', 'party', 'Japan', 'minister', 'Koizumi', 'just', 'Jimin', 'Jimin', 'famous', 'party', 'sympatric', 'thinking', 'WW2', 'Japan', 'responsibility.Though', 'Yasukuni', 'Japan', 'compensation', 'problems', 'are', 'so', 'finally', 'people', 'who', 'appeal', 'Japanese', 'jusifice', 'are', 'Japanese', 'politicians', 'will', 'be', 'benefits', 'honors', 'want', 'know', 'are', 'many', 'Japanese', 'should', 'have', 'responsibilities', 'Japan', 'Nankin', 'Slaughter', 'so', 'Japan', 'should', 'admit', 'worst', 'crime', 'compensation', 'think', 'can', 'say', 'same', 'thing', 'U.S.A', 'So', 'Zmu', 'Slaughter', 'Vietnam', 'War', 'could', 'not', 'believe', 'what', 'crimers', 'were', 'not', 'blamed', 'U.S', 'court', 'U.S.A', 'standed', 'anti-war', 'promotion', 'opportunity', 'are', 'thinking', 'gap', 'politicians', 'general', 'people', 'Japan.I', 'want', 'say', 'Hiroshima', 'Nagasaki', 'atomic', 'bombs', 'Japan', 'intended', 'win', 'WW2', 'even', 'sacrificed', 'nations', 'can', 'understand', 'see', 'Okinwa', 'disaster', 'lost', 'Okinawa', '1/3', 'nations', 'must', 'be', 'other', 'means', 'could', 'solve', 'throwing', 'atomic', 'bombs', 'Atomic', 'bomb', 'most', 'terrible', 'means', 'lead', 'human', 'collapse', 'mean', 'mental', 'physical', 'Many', 'Japanese', 'girls', 'committed', 'suicide', 'pain', 'never-cured', 'scars', 'atomic', 'bombs', 'many', 'people', 'have', 'suffered', 'fears', 'radioactive', 'rays.I', 'have', 'written', 'many', 'things', 'Japan', 'U.S.A', 'think', 'may', 'watch', 'movie', 'more', 'simple', 'eyes', 'having', 'sympathy', 'Setsuko', 'Seita', 'who', 'lost', 'life', 'should', 'have', 'Peace', 'Love', 'Starvation', 'so', 'simply', 'deeply.Many', 'sentences', 'wrote', 'have', 'been', 'review', 'movie', 'However', 'mean', 'peace', 'dared', 'write', 'them.I', ""'m"", 'sorry', 'poor', 'sentence']",N/A

If the movie had been live action rather than animation, I'm sure it would have been criticized for its unrelenting misery and its somewhat maudlin manipulation of the viewer's emotions.At the beginning of the movie we learn the fate of the two main characters, a young brother and his even younger sister.  So there are few surprises, and the unrelieved suffering of the children becomes tedious rather than profound.Granted, there is artistry here. Much of the animation is beautiful and demonstrates the Japanese reverence for nature, while there is a faithful historical rendering of time and place. There is also a subtext at work: what happens to the young boy is a metaphor for what happened to Japan.Younger children may find the experience affecting but far too disturbing, while discriminating adults will most likely be turned off by the cloying sentiment.For a truly harrowing and heartbreaking film about the effects of war on children, ""Grave of the Fireflies"" compares unfavorably in my opinion to ""Forbidden Games.""",2,A Disappointment,1051228800,"04 25, 2003",2003,1221,"['Grave', 'Fireflies', 'noble', 'attempt', 'deliver', 'strong', 'anti-war', 'message', 'children', 'film', 'remarkable', 'mostly', 'hell', 'war', 'graphically', 'shown', 'cartoon', 'form', 'movie', 'had', 'been', 'live', 'action', 'rather', 'animation', ""'m"", 'sure', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'criticized', 'unrelenting', 'misery', 'somewhat', 'maudlin', 'manipulation', 'viewer', 'emotions.At', 'beginning', 'movie', 'learn', 'fate', 'two', 'main', 'characters', 'young', 'brother', 'even', 'younger', 'sister', 'are', 'few', 'surprises', 'unrelieved', 'suffering', 'children', 'tedious', 'rather', 'profound.Granted', 'artistry', 'here', 'Much', 'animation', 'beautiful', 'Japanese', 'reverence', 'nature', 'faithful', 'historical', 'rendering', 'time', 'place', 'also', 'subtext', 'work', 'what', 'young', 'boy', 'metaphor', 'what', 'happened', 'Japan.Younger', 'children', 'may', 'find', 'experience', 'affecting', 'far', 'too', 'disturbing', 'discriminating', 'adults', 'will', 'most', 'likely', 'be', 'turned', 'off', 'cloying', 'truly', 'harrowing', 'heartbreaking', 'film', 'effects', 'war', 'children', 'Grave', 'Fireflies', 'unfavorably', 'opinion', 'Forbidden', 'Games']",N/A

In the DVD a youth of fifteen or so must care for his young sister of fiveyears. They have just lost their mother  to the fire bombings of Tokyo in the last stages ofWorld War II. Terror is all aroung and thus they flee to the countryside where a distant relativerelunctantly takes them in. They are neglected and treated rudely by this cousin or aunt who favorsonly her own child and again they decide to leave for even more distant parts which might be friendlierbut of course that is not the case.  They delight in viewing he fireflies at night and wonder where theygo when the day returns. The fireflies are symbolic of their own situation which is getting more desperateday by day. The youth is driven to stealing in desperation and he is beaten by neighbors and subject toabuse at the local police station. By the time he is able to return with only the barest of substancesfor his now starving sister it is too late. Her ghost seems to be emulating the fireflies who have longdisappeared now. He too is driven to the edge and after the end of the war he ends up back in the Tokyosubways literally starving to death (it is too late for some rice cookies to help him which are placed inhis dying hand by a passing stranger). It is indeed a terrible tragedy since all his heroic efforts to savehis sister came to nothing.  The countryside scenes are stunning in this animated depiction of the crueltyand barbarous nature of war on the innocent. One cannot help but cry at the end of the film and wish thatthe children would not follow the way of the fireflies.

And no, I won't say much about the plot, so you'll have to live through it on your own.I don't know any movie that makes the horror of war look more real. Yes, you expect horror out in the trenches. Back home, there are the nerve-wracking air raid sirens that could split the night at any time. The real horrors, though, are the broken families and people, the starvation, and collapse of social structure. Honest, loving people turn into looters, because there's no other way to put food in front of their children.There are bright points in the movie, that somehow never dim. Seita is a young boy forced way too early into being parent and provider for his little sister. He does it, though, with a dedication that doesn't crumple under any of the burdens piled on him. Setsuko is his sister, maybe four, and she does her part, too. She is happy with the heart-breakingly little that her big brother can give her, and does what she can in the tasks of their life. And, with a child's innocent acceptance that the world is as it should be, she learns about death.There is no happy ending.

In this case, it depicts an older brother and his much younger sister losing their mother in a bombing, trying to survive, only for the nails to be driven in deeper by their father dying. At first their situation is bad as they are forced to ration food, live in an abandoned mine shaft, only for the situation to become so desperate that the young girl dies of malnutrition whereas the older brother dies of malnutrition and exhaustion.Needless to say the film is a real eye opener, a real tear-jerker, and a MUST for any anime collection!",5,Could this be the saddest anime I have ever watched?,1361750400,"02 25, 2013",2013,943,"['Compared', 'lot', 'modern', 'Japanese', 'animation', 'high', 'defenition', 'film', 'flashy', 'animation', 'special', 'effects', 'one', 'much', 'older', 'grainy', 'look', 'almost', 'special', 'effects', 'whatsoever', 'yet', 'huge', 'points', 'way', 'story', 'story', 'set', 'WWII', 'Japan', 'needless', 'suffering', 'people', 'too', 'young', 'understand', 'full', 'concepts', 'war', 'case', 'older', 'brother', 'much', 'younger', 'sister', 'losing', 'mother', 'bombing', 'trying', 'survive', 'only', 'nails', 'be', 'driven', 'deeper', 'father', 'dying', 'first', 'situation', 'bad', 'are', 'forced', 'ration', 'food', 'live', 'abandoned', 'mine', 'shaft', 'only', 'situation', 'become', 'so', 'desperate', 'young', 'girl', 'dies', 'malnutrition', 'older', 'brother', 'dies', 'malnutrition', 'exhaustion.Needless', 'say', 'film', 'real', 'eye', 'opener', 'real', 'tear-jerker', 'MUST', 'anime', 'collection']",N/A

The film is not for entertainment at all, this is to tell the tale of what occured, if nothing at all, this is a lesson for all of us, what war on both sides of the fight can bring about, as a reminder.This story, unlike some of the movies released about the second world war, has no redemption or humor. The tragic events that unfolded in Japan while America dropped the bombs, tore the Japanese countryside apart, as seen in this film.When fourteen year old Seita and four year old Setsuko's mother is killed by a bomb that left hundreds upon hundreds homeless and familyless, they are sent to live with their prideful aunt. As the story progresses, Seita face insults and harsh judgement for staying home and taking care of his motherless sister while their father is at war. From many arguements, to being on their own outside the village of their aunt, Seita and Setsuko face abuse, starvation and disease. To the very end, the two fend for themselves and strive to survive.This movie was based on a novel called ""Grave of the fireflies"" and the personal account of the director. It is very real, even as an anime.

The film is set during the waning days of WW II in Japan. The Land of the Rising Sun is in a state of chaos, enduring firebombing raids, and amidst this, the tragic and heartbreaking tale of a pair of siblings unfold.Seita and his young sister Setsuko endure one tragedy after another. They lose their mother in a firebombing raid and go to live with an aunt and her family. The children's father is away at war and they have not been able to contact him. Meanwhile, the aunt is a mean woman who begrudges the children any love and views them as burdensome 'brats&#34;. Seita, refusing to endure his aunt's cruelty, takes Setsuko to live in an air raid shelter where the siblings lead an idyllic life for a while. But as their resources dwindle, the siblings find it hard to manage, as food becomes more scarce.The theme of sibling love is so beautifully portrayed in this film. The young Seita, still a boy himself, does all he can to keep his sister happy and safe. Ever resourceful, Seita goes from trading goods for food, to eventually thievery out of desperation. The scenes of Seita running into empty homes during firebombing raids, in the hopes of finding food or goods to trade is one I will not soon forget. It conveys the desperation of the times, as innocent children are left to fend for themselves, enduring the most horrific circumstances.The story is inspired by the retellings of survivor Nosaka Akiyuki; the haunting soundtrack evokes the beauty of sibling love and the tragedy of war and conveys the loss of innocence and lives in the most poignant way.
