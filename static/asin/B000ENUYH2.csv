We get a couple head high kicks from Van Damme. I'm tempted to give this movie 5 stars. It will entertain for the 90 minutes. It's a good shoot em up flick.The plot is 15 Marines are inside the USA embassy and outside there are hundreds of rebels attacking the USA embassy. Help is many hours away. Can the Marines hold down the embassy until help arrives?

I only wish to point out the few glitches which I could not digest about the plot, which is otherwise gripping. Here they go:1. Why did Jean-Claude Van Damme and his band of charged marines not knock the head of the militia leader who was within shooting range, directing his gang?2.Why did the hero, while in command, cut off negotiation with the rebel leader in a jiffy, while the experienced army man should have done well to prolong the talks to buy time, given that reinforcement was only hours away?3. How could the handful of marines, with supply of ammo `not enough to fight a girls' scout war', hold fort for such a long time and fend off a very sophisticated attack laced with rockets and even tanks?4. Why did the two associates of the Americans, fighting the rebels in the sly (the bicycle bombers) not finish the rebel leader and put an end to the seize?5.Why should the rebel leader enter the embassy building without a gun, as he comes face to face with Van Damme? Is it only to give occasion to a great hand-to hand fight in which he would be killed?6. How could the marine use the nails, nuts and bolts collected in an open tin box to such an devastating effect killing many of the militia? This was not credible.There are still more, but I think the aforementioned are the icing in the cake.Chinmay HotaAuthor of 'Hits and Misses'",3,Howlers Galore,1291420800,"12 4, 2010",2010,1440,"['26', 'reviewers', 'have', 'analyzed', 'movie', 'threadbare', 'posted', 'candid', 'opinions', 'only', 'wish', 'point', 'out', 'few', 'glitches', 'could', 'not', 'digest', 'plot', 'otherwise', 'gripping', 'Here', 'go:1', 'Why', 'did', 'Jean-Claude', 'Van', 'Damme', 'band', 'charged', 'marines', 'not', 'knock', 'head', 'militia', 'leader', 'who', 'was', 'shooting', 'range', 'directing', 'gang', '2.Why', 'did', 'hero', 'command', 'cut', 'off', 'negotiation', 'rebel', 'leader', 'jiffy', 'experienced', 'army', 'man', 'should', 'have', 'done', 'well', 'prolong', 'talks', 'buy', 'time', 'given', 'reinforcement', 'was', 'only', 'hours', 'away', '3', 'How', 'could', 'handful', 'marines', 'supply', 'ammo', 'not', 'enough', 'fight', 'girls', 'scout', 'war', 'hold', 'fort', 'long', 'time', 'fend', 'off', 'very', 'sophisticated', 'attack', 'laced', 'rockets', 'even', 'tanks', '4', 'Why', 'did', 'two', 'associates', 'Americans', 'fighting', 'rebels', 'sly', 'bicycle', 'bombers', 'not', 'finish', 'rebel', 'leader', 'put', 'end', 'seize', '5.Why', 'should', 'rebel', 'leader', 'enter', 'embassy', 'building', 'gun', 'face', 'face', 'Van', 'Damme', 'only', 'give', 'occasion', 'great', 'hand-to', 'hand', 'fight', 'would', 'be', 'killed', '6', 'How', 'could', 'marine', 'nails', 'nuts', 'bolts', 'collected', 'open', 'tin', 'box', 'devastating', 'effect', 'killing', 'many', 'militia', 'was', 'not', 'credible.There', 'are', 'still', 'more', 'think', 'aforementioned', 'are', 'icing', 'cake.Chinmay', 'HotaAuthor', ""'Hits"", 'Misses']",N/A

Communist insurgents, who are dedicated to the former dictator Alexei Kirilov and are lead by Tavarov, start a riot and they plan on taking back the country.

Chaos erupts and fifty Americans are taken hostage, leaving Kennan as the only one that can stop them.I've never even heard of this movie until watching it on DVD.

975068,A3KF4IP2MUS8QQ,B000ENUYH2,"Daniel Jolley ""darkgenius""","[4, 5]","Second in Command isn't that bad of a movie, in my opinion, largely because there are enough gunfights, explosions, and general mayhem to overshadow some of the weaknesses in the story.  With a couple of exceptions (largely moments of less than heartfelt Marine bravado), the acting is acceptable.  Van Damme is Van Damme, of course; he's fine as long as he's shouting orders or killing people, but the romantic relationship between his character and a female reporter doesn't have enough spark to light a cigarette.  And while I'm on the subject, why oh why can't we have at least one military-related movie without the main character getting sidetracked all the time with a love interest?  In this particular case, the little love subplot does more harm than good - it's pretty hard for me to respect a military attach&eacute; to a country clearly on the brink of internal chaos who stops off on his way to the embassy to conduct a very personal inspection of a female reporter.  By the time Sam Kennan (Van Damme) reports for duty, several journalists are dead and things are already beginning to hit the fan over at the Presidential palace.The story takes place in the fictional Eastern European country of Moldavia.  In this supposedly peaceful country, supporters of the former leader are unhappy with the newly-elected President, and a Communist insurgency is egging them on wholeheartedly as they surround the Presidential palace.  With the military (yes, the entire military) having been dispatched elsewhere for some stupid reason, only a few palace guards stand between the President and what is quickly becoming a lynch mob.  Over at the American embassy, the ambassador agrees with Keenan that they must act to preserve the fragile democracy by extracting the President from the palace.  That's not the hard part, though.  The hard part involves keeping the President secure inside an American embassy housing a force of only fifteen Marines.  The insurgents surround the place, ready, willing, and able to storm the building, drag the President out, and start building their new Communist government.  From this point on, the action is hard and heavy.Things aren't all that peaceful inside the embassy, as there is some question as to who is really in charge.  Keenan insists that they stay and try to hold off the militants until backup arrives in the form of the President's Army and a force of American Marines, while a truly insufferable CIA agent recommends evacuation.  It proves to be something of a moot point, as the heroes have one heck of a fight on their hands.You have to take some of the events at face-value.  I'm still scratching my head over the idea of sending the country's entire army several hours away from a volatile capital city, and I don't believe for one minute that there is any city in Eastern Europe that American forces couldn't reach in less than four hours.  I also don't think Keenan lived up to his billing as the best at what he did, as he made several mistakes that proved costly later on.  I also have to wonder why no one tried to kill the leader of the insurgents; the guy was constantly in the line of fire, but no one even took a pot shot at him.Despite some obvious weaknesses in its easily predictable plot, though, Second in Command did succeed in capturing and sustaining my attention.  It's not a great film by any means, but it's hard not to get some kind of kick out of a movie with this much hard-hitting action.",4,"Communism rears its ugly head, and Van Damme is there",1151712000,"07 1, 2006",2006,3476,"['Second', 'Command', ""n't"", 'bad', 'movie', 'opinion', 'largely', 'are', 'enough', 'gunfights', 'explosions', 'general', 'mayhem', 'overshadow', 'weaknesses', 'story', 'couple', 'exceptions', 'largely', 'moments', 'less', 'heartfelt', 'Marine', 'bravado', 'acting', 'acceptable', 'Van', 'Damme', 'Van', 'Damme', 'course', 'fine', 'as', 'long', 'shouting', 'orders', 'killing', 'people', 'romantic', 'relationship', 'character', 'female', 'reporter', ""n't"", 'have', 'enough', 'spark', 'light', 'cigarette', ""'m"", 'subject', 'why', 'oh', 'why', 'ca', ""n't"", 'have', 'least', 'one', 'military-related', 'movie', 'main', 'character', 'getting', 'sidetracked', 'time', 'love', 'interest', 'particular', 'case', 'little', 'love', 'subplot', 'more', 'harm', 'good', 'pretty', 'hard', 'respect', 'military', 'attach', 'eacute', 'country', 'clearly', 'brink', 'internal', 'chaos', 'who', 'off', 'way', 'embassy', 'conduct', 'very', 'personal', 'inspection', 'female', 'reporter', 'time', 'Sam', 'Kennan', 'Van', 'Damme', 'reports', 'duty', 'several', 'journalists', 'are', 'dead', 'things', 'are', 'already', 'beginning', 'hit', 'fan', 'Presidential', 'palace.The', 'story', 'place', 'fictional', 'Eastern', 'European', 'country', 'Moldavia', 'supposedly', 'peaceful', 'country', 'supporters', 'former', 'leader', 'are', 'unhappy', 'newly-elected', 'President', 'Communist', 'insurgency', 'egging', 'wholeheartedly', 'surround', 'Presidential', 'palace', 'military', 'yes', 'entire', 'military', 'having', 'been', 'dispatched', 'elsewhere', 'stupid', 'reason', 'only', 'few', 'palace', 'guards', 'stand', 'President', 'what', 'quickly', 'becoming', 'lynch', 'mob', 'American', 'embassy', 'ambassador', 'Keenan', 'must', 'act', 'preserve', 'fragile', 'democracy', 'extracting', 'President', 'palace', 'not', 'hard', 'part', 'though', 'hard', 'part', 'keeping', 'President', 'secure', 'American', 'embassy', 'housing', 'force', 'only', 'fifteen', 'Marines', 'insurgents', 'surround', 'place', 'ready', 'willing', 'able', 'storm', 'building', 'drag', 'President', 'start', 'building', 'new', 'Communist', 'government', 'point', 'action', 'hard', 'heavy.Things', 'are', ""n't"", 'peaceful', 'embassy', 'question', 'who', 'really', 'charge', 'Keenan', 'stay', 'try', 'hold', 'off', 'militants', 'backup', 'arrives', 'form', 'President', 'Army', 'force', 'American', 'Marines', 'truly', 'insufferable', 'CIA', 'agent', 'evacuation', 'be', 'something', 'moot', 'point', 'heroes', 'have', 'one', 'heck', 'fight', 'hands.You', 'have', 'take', 'events', 'face-value', ""'m"", 'still', 'scratching', 'head', 'idea', 'sending', 'country', 'entire', 'army', 'several', 'hours', 'away', 'volatile', 'capital', 'city', 'do', ""n't"", 'believe', 'one', 'minute', 'city', 'Eastern', 'Europe', 'American', 'forces', 'could', ""n't"", 'reach', 'less', 'four', 'hours', 'also', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'Keenan', 'lived', 'up', 'billing', 'best', 'what', 'did', 'made', 'several', 'mistakes', 'proved', 'costly', 'later', 'also', 'have', 'wonder', 'why', 'one', 'tried', 'kill', 'leader', 'insurgents', 'guy', 'was', 'constantly', 'line', 'fire', 'one', 'even', 'took', 'pot', 'shot', 'him.Despite', 'obvious', 'weaknesses', 'easily', 'predictable', 'plot', 'though', 'Second', 'Command', 'did', 'succeed', 'capturing', 'sustaining', 'attention', 'not', 'great', 'film', 'means', 'hard', 'not', 'get', 'kind', 'kick', 'movie', 'much', 'hard-hitting', 'action']",N/A

No tournament (Considering Bloodsport, I'm really sad that more of his movies aren't tournament oriented)6.  Is training needed for this tournament?  Pretty much every JCVD movie revolves around martial arts training or military training.  This movie is no different.7.  Does he do the splits in training or in the tournament?  No splits, no tournament8.  Does he punch someone in the balls?  Grab, squeeze, twist, kick, knee...all in a row...all to the same guy.  Ouch.9.  Does he do a series of flying or 360 kicks?  Saved like presents on Christmas, JCVD unleashes on the final unfortunate villain.10.  Is his enemy unbeatable? Armed insurgents are a worthy adversary, but never unbeatable; they're too rag-tag and insufficiently supplied.11.  Does he overcome an injury or other hindrance? He has to constantly battle strategy and defense with a smarmy CIA agent born without a spine or balls.12.  Does he win?  JCVD wins, but it's mainly due to the assist from the Apache helicoptersShot partially in a hand-held home video - presumably to add a more realistic feel - the actual scenes are tough to digest.  Each scene is so poorly done that it gives off the feel that there simply wasn't a budget sufficient enough to film the entire move with the ""big cameras"".  JCVD would have benefited from a viewing of Samuel L. Jackson'sRules of Engagementfor an appropriate reaction to an embassy attack.

Directed by Simon Fellows he also directed Until Death. Starring Jean Claude Van Damme as Commander Sam Keenan,  Julie Cox as Michelle Whitman William Tapley as Frank Gains, Velior Topic as Anton Tavarov & Serban Celea as Yuri Amirev an Eastern European President. Story is this President has been elected this pro communist group don't like the results. Anton Tavarov is the man who doesn't like the new President Yuri Amirev so Commander Sam Keenan Second In Command at The US Embassy or so we think has to get President Amirev to the embassy. Tavarov & his men want the embassy they'll kill some hostages if the former President isn't released. 1 of the hostages is Michelle Whitman a reporter that Keenan has a relationship. Keenan & some soldiers move into action save her & the camera crew. The Terrorists take out the communications & Keenan needs to connect to Washington & they use the Satillite phone he finds out Captain John Baldwin is actually in command. Then we also have Frank Gains I think  he's an inside man for the terrorists but he's a by the book a** w hole. He wants everybody to cut & run. When people are being led out the bus taking them away blows up & Captain Baldwin tells  Keenan you're more skilled for the job. There waiting for this General to show up he's on the terrorists side he shoots Gains in the head. Van Damme should've been the 1 to do it we get pretty good finish & decent fight between Keenan & Tavarov.

975073,A2E1QTFS01GT4P,B000ENUYH2,"J. Urban ""U2fan4ever76""","[8, 9]","I went to several stores here in Charlotte, NC to search for the DVD and found very few copies were available (they were hidden on the shelf--not even in the ""new release"" section) and were retailing at $22. I thought that was a bit rediculous for a direct-to-dvd Van Damme flick, but being a fan I spent the money anyways.Overall, I found the movie very boring and completely forgettable. I think it finally hit me that Van Damme will never make another movie that I will thoroughly enjoy (the last being Maximum Risk - 10 years ago).The Plot - DDon't worry about spoilers as this plot has been used so many times before there is nothing to spoil. Hero gets dispatched to a war zone, hero must gain respect of peers, hero must have a love interest to break up the action segments, hero must be betrayed or have something bad happen, and then the hero saves the day. If you are familar with the original Assault on Precinct 13, then picture that movie but in a military, foreign country setting. Also, it doesn't help that the movie is very short--standard 90 minutes or less.Character Development/Acting - CVan Damme was playing, well Van Damme (actually Commander Keenan). His acting has not changed in over a decade. (His acting improved back in 1995's Timecop from his earlier movies, but has never gotten any better since Timecop.) He is stiff, hard to understand and never really all that believable as a Navy SEAL. For those of us who loved his old movies and the martial arts--forget it. He has maybe 3-4 one-on-one fights where he does a few kicks, but mostly uses punches, a knife, a gun and a assault rifle to dispatch the enemies. They try to give his character a back story about why he won't evacuate the embassy, but it is so vague and short, that it really doesn't matter.As for the supporting actors, there were no standouts. They all played their roles and I have never seen any of them in anything before. At least in Wake of Death, you had a young Asian actress who, in my opinion, did a great job in her role alongside Van Damme. In this movie, every supporting actor was utterly forgettable. The forced romance between the female newsreporter and Van Damme's Keenan was out of place in this kind of movie and there was no chemistry between the two.Music Score/Sound - DWas there one?  Seriously, I cannot remember even one melody or action score. As for sound, well, it was the typical machine guns, loud explosions, etc.Cinematography/Visual Effects - CThis category would have actually gotten a B, except that certain scenes have some very noticeably bad CGI and model effects. The actual cinematography was good with some hand camera work that made you feel that you were watching the events unravel on CNN. Likewise, the scale of the movie seemed a lot larger due to the camera angles and the existing architecture. (One scene has a bunch of people trying to assault the embassy and it was very convincing.)Movie Overall - CDVD Features - FThis release is perhaps the best example of a poorly made DVD.

975074,A2I4WF84MWIBO7,B000ENUYH2,Kai Lu,"[2, 3]","I am in my twenties now and am more into drama films and trendy artistic films from foreign countries (chalk that up to my wife's influence on me), but I still have a guilty predeliction for unapologetically mindless action movies where things blow up, bad guys do bad things for no apparent reason, and (of course) a heroic character defeats countless enemies using martial arts and other cool fighting techniques, while those same countless numbers of villains fail to kill him despite firing millions of rounds of machine gun ammunition at him.I used to love Van Damme movies when I was aged 8-14, back when he was making better films, although I've always considered him a subpar actor (the same is also true, in my opinion, for Arnold Swarzennegger). I thought his martial arts scenes in movies like Bloodsport and Kickboxer were worth the rental price (or, in those days, asking my mom or dad to rent them for me).Then came 1995's Timecop, and I absolutely loved that movie (as a child -- now it seems kind of tame and not as good as I remembered it). I thought VanDaame was finally becoming a better actor and fast on his way to being a megastar.Unfortunately, VanDamme's career has faded since then, after a string of box-office and critical failures, and he has become more of a B-grade star and direct-to-video actor a-la Michael Dudinkoff (American Ninja). It's good to see that he's still working, but it seems like his work is really sucking right now. One exception might be 2000's Legionnaire, a VanDamme movie that is surprisingly good, though certainly no Hard Target -- a movie from his glory days.For me, I think one of the biggest reasons why Van Damme is on a downward spiral as far as his movies go (aside from his lousy acting) is because he's lost credibility as a martial arts virtuoso. I chalk this up to the time he allegedly got beat up at a nightclub. In the version I heard, Van Damme was purportedly behaving in an obnoxious manner in the club, and security naturally confronted him and asked him to moderate his behavior, or leave. Van Damme then allegedly began mouthing off at the security guard (a beefy skinhead-looking guy) and performing various martial arts moves apparently designed to intimidate the other guy. The other guy, I guess, wasn't impressed because he then decked Van Damme with one right cross and Van Damme left the club on a stretcher.Sigh.How the mighty have fallen.Oh, by the way, Second in Command sucks.",2,"When I was little I used to love VanDamme, and it's sad that he's come to this!",1149552000,"06 6, 2006",2006,2462,"['am', 'twenties', 'now', 'am', 'more', 'drama', 'films', 'trendy', 'artistic', 'films', 'foreign', 'countries', 'chalk', 'up', 'wife', 'influence', 'still', 'have', 'guilty', 'predeliction', 'unapologetically', 'mindless', 'action', 'movies', 'where', 'things', 'blow', 'up', 'bad', 'guys', 'do', 'bad', 'things', 'apparent', 'reason', 'course', 'heroic', 'character', 'defeats', 'countless', 'enemies', 'using', 'martial', 'arts', 'other', 'cool', 'fighting', 'techniques', 'same', 'countless', 'numbers', 'villains', 'fail', 'kill', 'firing', 'millions', 'rounds', 'machine', 'gun', 'ammunition', 'him.I', 'used', 'love', 'Van', 'Damme', 'movies', 'when', 'was', 'aged', '8-14', 'back', 'when', 'was', 'making', 'better', 'films', ""'ve"", 'always', 'considered', 'subpar', 'actor', 'same', 'also', 'true', 'opinion', 'Arnold', 'Swarzennegger', 'thought', 'martial', 'arts', 'scenes', 'movies', 'Bloodsport', 'Kickboxer', 'were', 'worth', 'rental', 'price', 'days', 'asking', 'mom', 'dad', 'rent', '.Then', 'came', '1995', 'Timecop', 'absolutely', 'loved', 'movie', 'child', 'now', 'kind', 'tame', 'not', 'as', 'good', 'remembered', 'thought', 'VanDaame', 'was', 'finally', 'becoming', 'better', 'actor', 'fast', 'way', 'being', 'megastar.Unfortunately', 'VanDamme', 'career', 'faded', 'then', 'string', 'box-office', 'critical', 'failures', 'become', 'more', 'B-grade', 'star', 'direct-to-video', 'actor', 'a-la', 'Michael', 'Dudinkoff', 'American', 'Ninja', 'good', 'see', 'still', 'working', 'work', 'really', 'sucking', 'right', 'now', 'One', 'exception', 'might', 'be', '2000', 'Legionnaire', 'VanDamme', 'movie', 'surprisingly', 'good', 'certainly', 'Hard', 'Target', 'movie', 'glory', 'days.For', 'think', 'one', 'biggest', 'reasons', 'why', 'Van', 'Damme', 'downward', 'spiral', 'as', 'far', 'movies', 'go', 'aside', 'lousy', 'acting', 'lost', 'credibility', 'martial', 'arts', 'virtuoso', 'chalk', 'up', 'time', 'allegedly', 'got', 'beat', 'up', 'nightclub', 'version', 'heard', 'Van', 'Damme', 'was', 'purportedly', 'behaving', 'obnoxious', 'manner', 'club', 'security', 'naturally', 'confronted', 'asked', 'moderate', 'behavior', 'leave', 'Van', 'Damme', 'then', 'allegedly', 'began', 'mouthing', 'off', 'security', 'guard', 'beefy', 'skinhead-looking', 'guy', 'performing', 'various', 'martial', 'arts', 'moves', 'apparently', 'designed', 'intimidate', 'other', 'guy', 'other', 'guy', 'guess', 'was', ""n't"", 'impressed', 'then', 'decked', 'Van', 'Damme', 'one', 'right', 'cross', 'Van', 'Damme', 'left', 'club', 'stretcher.Sigh.How', 'mighty', 'have', 'fallen.Oh', 'way', 'Second', 'Command', 'sucks']",N/A

975077,A2WCRX5OQM6FED,B000ENUYH2,"Mike Sehorn ""The Phantom Projectionist""","[1, 1]","During his DTV tenure, Jean-Claude Van Damme's movies have generally been eithergoodor at leastnotableon a creative level, and he's only ever done one decisivelybadfilm during this part of his career. However, with ""Second in Command,"" Van Damme adds his first real ""meh"" movie to his low-budget library: it's a film that does some things right, others wrong, but it doesn't matter too much because the entire thing's just so uninteresting. For proven fans, this one's not bad enough to disqualify a purchase, but casual Van Damme devotees can definitely pick up better things from the bargain bin.The story: Commander Sam Keenan (Van Damme) is appointed to second-in-command of the American embassy in an unstable East European nation. When a violent revolutionary faction stages a government coup, Sam must protect both the country's president and a number of American civilians in the besieged embassy.The country in question (Moldavia) hasn't actually existed for over 150 years, but it shares much of the characteristic volatility of several Eastern European nations. With that said, ""Second in Command"" isn't a political movie and doesn't examine the complex social and state-related problems of such places. Instead, the story is extremely black & white and therefore not very intriguing for anyone not looking for a light Americana adventure. Additionally, none of the characters are interesting either (I'm usually not bothered by this but there's no good action to make up for this; more on that in a moment): the acting's generally good, but good guys and villains are defined by their political affiliation of either revolutionaries or non-revolutionaries, whereas Jean-Claude and his love interest/reporter Julie Cox (An Angel For May) play some of the worst-defined caricatures I've seen in a Van Damme movie. William Tapley (""Backup"") is colorless as the weaselly government agent. As far as Jean-Claude goes, it's just not a lot of fun to watch him run around as part of a military unit like he is here: he works best as a solo hero, not as a member of a constant crowd.The action is mainly limited to impersonal mass shootouts and explosions with a bit of hand-to-hand fighting. Nothing's exactly lacking but none of it's very spectacular. Van Damme's final battle with lead villain Velibor Topic (Kingdom of Heaven) is actually a decent brawl, albeit too short and mucked about with slow motion. About halfway through the movie, there's a moment of surprising brutality wherein Van Damme kicks, stomps, and knees an attacker's groin about a half-dozen times before gouging his eyes in. In other aspects, I appreciate the authentic Romanian (or Russian?) being spoken throughout the film, as well as the fact that the production is generally strong. ""Second in Command"" feels like a bigger, better movie that's been scaled down to accommodate a reduced budget; if, say, Bruce Willis had played Van Damme's role and the production had a couple extra million bucks to spend, the movie might have been a respectable little blockbuster. But only if the filmmakers removed that awful sepia tint the picture has: I marginally prefer the light gold coloration to the grey overtone favored of many filmed-in-Europe flicks, but it's still pretty dull to watch.Easily digested and easily forgotten, I'm nevertheless glad Van Damme managed to get this out of his system before he moved on towards his comeback. His one true throwaway film of the last twelve years will likely continue to gather the dust of obscurity, but should you unearth it, know that it's at least more pleasant than finding a landmine.",3,"""I'll give 'em what they want, as long as they want hell""",1327795200,"01 29, 2012",2012,3613,"['DTV', 'tenure', 'Jean-Claude', 'Van', 'Damme', 'movies', 'have', 'generally', 'been', 'eithergoodor', 'leastnotableon', 'creative', 'level', 'only', 'ever', 'done', 'one', 'decisivelybadfilm', 'part', 'career', 'However', 'Second', 'Command', 'Van', 'Damme', 'first', 'real', 'meh', 'movie', 'low-budget', 'library', 'film', 'things', 'right', 'others', 'wrong', ""n't"", 'matter', 'too', 'much', 'entire', 'thing', 'just', 'so', 'uninteresting', 'proven', 'fans', 'one', 'not', 'bad', 'enough', 'disqualify', 'purchase', 'casual', 'Van', 'Damme', 'devotees', 'can', 'definitely', 'pick', 'up', 'better', 'things', 'bargain', 'bin.The', 'story', 'Commander', 'Sam', 'Keenan', 'Van', 'Damme', 'appointed', 'second-in-command', 'American', 'embassy', 'unstable', 'East', 'European', 'nation', 'When', 'violent', 'revolutionary', 'faction', 'government', 'coup', 'Sam', 'must', 'protect', 'country', 'president', 'number', 'American', 'civilians', 'besieged', 'embassy.The', 'country', 'question', 'Moldavia', ""n't"", 'actually', 'existed', '150', 'years', 'shares', 'much', 'characteristic', 'volatility', 'several', 'Eastern', 'European', 'nations', 'said', 'Second', 'Command', ""n't"", 'political', 'movie', ""n't"", 'examine', 'complex', 'social', 'state-related', 'problems', 'such', 'places', 'Instead', 'story', 'extremely', 'black', 'white', 'therefore', 'not', 'very', 'intriguing', 'anyone', 'not', 'looking', 'light', 'Americana', 'adventure', 'Additionally', 'none', 'characters', 'are', 'interesting', ""'m"", 'usually', 'not', 'bothered', 'good', 'action', 'make', 'up', 'more', 'moment', 'acting', 'generally', 'good', 'good', 'guys', 'villains', 'are', 'defined', 'political', 'affiliation', 'revolutionaries', 'non-revolutionaries', 'Jean-Claude', 'love', 'interest/reporter', 'Julie', 'Cox', 'Angel', 'May', 'play', 'worst-defined', 'caricatures', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'Van', 'Damme', 'movie', 'William', 'Tapley', 'Backup', 'colorless', 'weaselly', 'government', 'agent', 'As', 'far', 'Jean-Claude', 'just', 'not', 'lot', 'fun', 'watch', 'run', 'around', 'part', 'military', 'unit', 'here', 'best', 'solo', 'hero', 'not', 'member', 'constant', 'crowd.The', 'action', 'mainly', 'limited', 'impersonal', 'mass', 'shootouts', 'explosions', 'bit', 'hand-to-hand', 'fighting', 'Nothing', 'exactly', 'lacking', 'none', 'very', 'spectacular', 'Van', 'Damme', 'final', 'battle', 'lead', 'villain', 'Velibor', 'Topic', 'Kingdom', 'Heaven', 'actually', 'decent', 'brawl', 'albeit', 'too', 'short', 'mucked', 'slow', 'motion', 'halfway', 'movie', 'moment', 'surprising', 'brutality', 'wherein', 'Van', 'Damme', 'kicks', 'stomps', 'attacker', 'groin', 'half-dozen', 'times', 'gouging', 'eyes', 'other', 'aspects', 'appreciate', 'authentic', 'Romanian', 'Russian', 'being', 'spoken', 'film', 'as', 'well', 'fact', 'production', 'generally', 'strong', 'Second', 'Command', 'feels', 'bigger', 'better', 'movie', 'been', 'scaled', 'down', 'accommodate', 'reduced', 'budget', 'say', 'Bruce', 'Willis', 'had', 'played', 'Van', 'Damme', 'role', 'production', 'had', 'couple', 'extra', 'million', 'bucks', 'spend', 'movie', 'might', 'have', 'been', 'respectable', 'little', 'blockbuster', 'only', 'filmmakers', 'removed', 'awful', 'sepia', 'tint', 'picture', 'marginally', 'prefer', 'light', 'gold', 'coloration', 'grey', 'overtone', 'favored', 'many', 'filmed-in-Europe', 'flicks', 'still', 'pretty', 'dull', 'watch.Easily', 'digested', 'easily', 'forgotten', ""'m"", 'nevertheless', 'glad', 'Van', 'Damme', 'managed', 'get', 'out', 'system', 'moved', 'towards', 'comeback', 'one', 'true', 'throwaway', 'film', 'last', 'twelve', 'years', 'will', 'likely', 'continue', 'gather', 'dust', 'obscurity', 'should', 'unearth', 'least', 'more', 'pleasant', 'finding', 'landmine']",N/A

The camera could not stay still for more than 3 seconds and I started to get a headache after the first 12 minutes. What was with everything being filmed in close up. I thought I had a full screen copy but I checked and it said widescreen. I find it hard to believe by the way this movie looks that they spent 22 million on it. What did they spend the money on, the fake CGI helicopters and a truck load of home movie digital camcorders!! Dolph Lundgrens The Defender is similar to this, made for 5 million and is a much better attempt at this type of movie and looks more than its budget. Second In Command does come of as a very cheap looking TV movie of the week with bad actors and cheaply dressed sets. Every actor in this was completely wooden including Van Damme who is taking himself way to seriously these days and the, I want to act and be taken seriously is starting to get tired. Show some personality or at least smile once in a while!! The fight scenes with Van Damme are short lasting about 15 seconds, are badly staged and filmed and consist of nothing more than a few kicks and a punch. The showdown with the main villian at the end is filmed in slow motion to drag it out a bit but is so dull you would rather speed it up just to get the movie over with. The action set pieces are terribly executed, filmed and lack any imagination. The movie is incredibly boring and I don't know why Van Damme thought this would be a fun, enjoyable action movie that the fans want to see because it's not. For me I'd have to put Second In Command between Derailed and Universal Soldier 2 in Van Dammes worst movies list with Derailed being the worst movie he has made since his career took of with the excellent Bloodsport. I'm very thankful I rented this instead of buying it outright DVD unseen expecting it to be as good as In Hell or Wake Of Death. A big step back for Van Damme.

975084,A1Z1NQJUJQ5CRO,B000ENUYH2,Robert Badgley,"[0, 0]","Following his release of Hard Corps,Van Damme starred in this 2006 film Second in Command.The production values are high(as have been most of his more recent works) and Van Damme comports himself well in this role.In this film Van Damme is a Navy SEAL Commander Sam Keenan,who arrives in Moldova(a real country by the way)to attend the US Embassy there.Unbeknownst to him he has arrived at a bad time,when the country is in upheaval.Foreign reporters are killed and the situation goes quickly from bad to worse.The US ambassador makes Keenan unofficially second in command,and immediately taking control of the situation he leads a team to retrieve that country's President.Back in the compound the embassy itself comes under attack from rebels.A call to the Pentagon for help elicits two response teams,each about six hours away;the US Marines in choppers and members of that country's armed forces out on patrol in the countryside.The attacking forces pummel the embassy and at any time it could be over run,if not for the smarts of Keenan.However a rocket attack kills the ambassador and the Pentagon,without having received any ""official"" word Keenan was made second in command,turns that job over to an attending CIA agent.The agent,against Keenan's wishes who elects to remain behind,forms an escape plan for the embassy's staff.He enlists the help of a local citizen supposedly loyal to the US,to provide a bus to take them to safety.They utilize a secret tunnel to escape but the supposedly ""loyal"" citizen double crosses them and tips off the rebels.Just before the bus is full and the Moldovan president is on board the bus blows up,killing all aboard.The rebels attack and the remaining group are forced to retreat back into the embassy,with the rebels hot on their trail.The tunnel entrance is sealed and now the rebels bring all their pressure to bear on the embassy and its remaining occupants.Just as things are getting unbearable the rebels pull back,just as the Moldovan army finally enters the town.Everyone inside cheers as the commanding CIA agent goes out to greet the General of the army.Cheers turn quickly to alarm as the rebels appear from behind the army column and they realize its a trap.The CIA agent is killed and everyone is forced back into the embassy as the rebels enter it and the army big guns pound away at the outside.When it looks as though all is doomed the Marines finally arrive at the scene in choppers and proceed to cut down the rebel and army forces.Keenan confronts the rebel leader inside the embassy compound and it's a fight to the death.After the terrible battle and the bloodshed the country's president returns to the palace to restore order to the country and Keenan sits,contemplating his next move.The film starts off a little slow as it sets up its storyline but as the action heats up so does the pace.The film is at its best when the embassy is under siege and a pall of claustrophobia falls over everything.The film also takes advantage of the vantage point of two reporters on the scene,a lady who knows Keenan intimately and especially her male counterpart,a cameraman.To give a you-are-there feel to the film,a few scenes of the on going battles are taken from his camera and the main camera(our fixed vantage point of view),periodically zooms quickly in or out as if being taken by an on the spot news reporter.To add to the mood,the film colour is slightly off colour;almost sepia in nature.Van Damme is in good form here as well as his fellow cast members.Technically the film has been transferred quite well and is in its' original a/r of 1:85:1.Except for the trailer there are just previews of vintage 2006 movies and nothing else.While not original in plot the story still intrigues,even though getting off to a slow start.The action soon heats up and is at its best when the embassy is under siege.JCVD is good as our protagonist and he is supported well by his fellow cast members.3 1/2-4 stars and recommended.",4,3 1/2 -4 stars as Van Damme tries to prevent a coupe!,1295308800,"01 18,

975088,A6VXZ1EEPRTLV,B000ENUYH2,trebe,"[0, 1]","Second In Command (2006) is a ridiculous action film, that through unrealistic pretense, sets up a conflict that defies nearly all established diplomatic protocols.  The film stars Jean-Claude Van Damme, as Commander Sam Keenan newly assigned to the US embassy in the European nation of Moldavia.  Following the election of new President Amirev (Serban Celea), opposition forces seek to overthrow the Moldavian government.  Fearing for his life Amirev requests sanctuary, and in a mystifying diplomatic maneuver, Keenan transports Amirev to the US embassy.  The US Government refuses to turn Amirev to the insurgents, and one reckless act instigates another, as the opposition force launch a rocket into the embassy, killing the Ambassador, and making Keenan the acting commander.Attacking an embassy is usually considered an act of war, to which the US responds with a few helicopters.  If the insurgents had any brains, they would put men high in the buildings surrounding the Embassy and hit it from all four sides.  A few more rocket strikes, and the battle would be over.  If the battlezone were not extremely limited, the meager American forces would not last long, so the enemy attack is always frontal, by ground forces.  Soldiers on both sides can't shoot straight most of the time, which is fortunate, since they routinely expose themselves to fire.  If the enemy had any decent snipers, the US forces would be history.  But reality is not what's important, and the film's budget is undoubtedly a factor in most of this nonsense, as more sets, soldiers, and equipment, would escalate production costs.  So Moldavia's 'army' consists just of a handful of armored vehicles.The US State Department, apparently likes working in the dark, and isn't very farsighted, if they send just one man to a country that they fear is unstable.  And there's no point bothering the US President with a small matter like war, when you have such high quality buffoons in command.  When the US helicopters do arrive, the inept opposition is unable to mount an attack, and Moldavia is saved.Van Damme can obviously do better than this.  Aside from Keenan's romantic interludes, and building him up as a hero, this film, like a professional wrestling match, is mostly about showcasing violence.  This pretentious mess is recommended mostly to dedicated fans of Van Damme, or those who just like the sound of gunfire, and seeing stuff getting blown up.",2,foreign policy fiasco . . .,1252195200,"09 6, 2009",2009,2438,"['Second', 'Command', '2006', 'ridiculous', 'action', 'film', 'unrealistic', 'pretense', 'up', 'conflict', 'nearly', 'established', 'diplomatic', 'protocols', 'film', 'Jean-Claude', 'Van', 'Damme', 'Commander', 'Sam', 'Keenan', 'newly', 'assigned', 'US', 'embassy', 'European', 'nation', 'Moldavia', 'Following', 'election', 'new', 'President', 'Amirev', 'Serban', 'Celea', 'opposition', 'forces', 'seek', 'overthrow', 'Moldavian', 'government', 'Fearing', 'life', 'Amirev', 'requests', 'sanctuary', 'mystifying', 'diplomatic', 'maneuver', 'Keenan', 'Amirev', 'US', 'embassy', 'US', 'Government', 'turn', 'Amirev', 'insurgents', 'one', 'reckless', 'act', 'opposition', 'force', 'launch', 'rocket', 'embassy', 'killing', 'Ambassador', 'making', 'Keenan', 'acting', 'commander.Attacking', 'embassy', 'usually', 'considered', 'act', 'war', 'US', 'few', 'helicopters', 'insurgents', 'had', 'brains', 'would', 'put', 'men', 'high', 'buildings', 'surrounding', 'Embassy', 'hit', 'four', 'sides', 'few', 'more', 'rocket', 'strikes', 'battle', 'would', 'be', 'battlezone', 'were', 'not', 'extremely', 'limited', 'meager', 'American', 'forces', 'would', 'not', 'last', 'long', 'enemy', 'attack', 'always', 'frontal', 'ground', 'forces', 'Soldiers', 'sides', 'ca', ""n't"", 'shoot', 'straight', 'most', 'time', 'fortunate', 'routinely', 'expose', 'fire', 'enemy', 'had', 'decent', 'snipers', 'US', 'forces', 'would', 'be', 'history', 'reality', 'not', 'what', 'important', 'film', 'budget', 'undoubtedly', 'factor', 'most', 'nonsense', 'more', 'sets', 'soldiers', 'equipment', 'would', 'escalate', 'production', 'costs', 'So', 'Moldavia', ""'army"", 'just', 'handful', 'armored', 'vehicles.The', 'US', 'State', 'Department', 'apparently', 'working', 'dark', ""n't"", 'very', 'farsighted', 'send', 'just', 'one', 'man', 'country', 'fear', 'unstable', 'point', 'bothering', 'US', 'President', 'small', 'matter', 'war', 'when', 'have', 'such', 'high', 'quality', 'buffoons', 'command', 'When', 'US', 'helicopters', 'do', 'arrive', 'inept', 'opposition', 'unable', 'mount', 'attack', 'Moldavia', 'saved.Van', 'Damme', 'can', 'obviously', 'do', 'better', 'Aside', 'Keenan', 'romantic', 'interludes', 'building', 'up', 'hero', 'film', 'professional', 'wrestling', 'match', 'mostly', 'showcasing', 'violence', 'pretentious', 'mess', 'recommended', 'mostly', 'dedicated', 'fans', 'Van', 'Damme', 'who', 'just', 'sound', 'gunfire', 'seeing', 'stuff', 'getting', 'blown', 'up']",N/A

975090,ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T,B000ENUYH2,Tsuyoshi,"[5, 6]","Among the numerous numbers of the direct-to-video films, Jean-Claude Van Damme's `Second in Commander' is far better than other average or below-average action films including those starring Steven Seagal and Wesley Snipes. The film's plot is just a retread of the familiar situation like `Assault on Precinct 13' or `Alamo,' but it keeps us entertained from the beginning to the end.Jean-Claude Van Damme is a newly arrived US commander Sam Keenan in some politically unstable Eastern Europe country where the insurgents try to capture the president of the country. The people are led by renegade leader Anton Tavarov (Velibor Topic), and they surround the U.S. Embassy where Keenan, the president and other Americans barricade themselves in the building. The rest of the film is about the chess game to survive, and the whole process is surprisingly well-done.Except the opening chapter where the film attempts to establish the `documentary' tone with shaky camera and grainy image, the setting of `Second in Command' is limited to the embassy where outnumbered marines try to fight back the swarming militia with firearms. There is a suggested romance between Jean-Claude Van Damme's character and a US journalist played by Julie Cox, but the sub-plot does not detract us from the tension of the film.Though Jean-Claude Van Damme does not show his martial arts skills as he used to (except the last sequence), the film's actions are effectively done, and though the range of his acting is still very limited, Van Damme's acting as washed-out commander is not bad. Unfortunately, the special effects used to express the explosions fail to convince us, lacking the money they should have. And most curious thing is, though the embassy is surrounded by the insurgents, their attack is always from one side of the block (namely the front gate), which is quite inexplicable.But in spite of its lower budget, `Second in Commander' is a good action film. Perhaps you must have seen everything in this film done elsewhere, but that does not change the fact the film has enough power to hold our attention throughout.",3,"Familiar Materials, But Well-Executed Actions",1154908800,"08 7, 2006",2006,2111,"['numerous', 'numbers', 'direct-to-video', 'films', 'Jean-Claude', 'Van', 'Damme', 'Second', 'Commander', 'far', 'better', 'other', 'average', 'below-average', 'action', 'films', 'including', 'starring', 'Steven', 'Seagal', 'Wesley', 'Snipes', 'film', 'plot', 'just', 'retread', 'familiar', 'situation', 'Assault', 'Precinct', '13', 'Alamo', 'entertained', 'beginning', 'end.Jean-Claude', 'Van', 'Damme', 'newly', 'arrived', 'US', 'commander', 'Sam', 'Keenan', 'politically', 'unstable', 'Eastern', 'Europe', 'country', 'where', 'insurgents', 'try', 'capture', 'president', 'country', 'people', 'are', 'led', 'renegade', 'leader', 'Anton', 'Tavarov', 'Velibor', 'Topic', 'surround', 'U.S.', 'Embassy', 'where', 'Keenan', 'president', 'other', 'Americans', 'barricade', 'building', 'rest', 'film', 'chess', 'game', 'survive', 'whole', 'process', 'surprisingly', 'well-done.Except', 'opening', 'chapter', 'where', 'film', 'attempts', 'establish', 'documentary', 'tone', 'shaky', 'camera', 'grainy', 'image', 'setting', 'Second', 'Command', 'limited', 'embassy', 'where', 'outnumbered', 'marines', 'try', 'fight', 'back', 'swarming', 'militia', 'firearms', 'suggested', 'romance', 'Jean-Claude', 'Van', 'Damme', 'character', 'US', 'journalist', 'played', 'Julie', 'Cox', 'sub-plot', 'not', 'detract', 'tension', 'film.Though', 'Jean-Claude', 'Van', 'Damme', 'not', 'show', 'martial', 'arts', 'skills', 'used', 'last', 'sequence', 'film', 'actions', 'are', 'effectively', 'done', 'range', 'acting', 'still', 'very', 'limited', 'Van', 'Damme', 'acting', 'washed-out', 'commander', 'not', 'bad', 'Unfortunately', 'special', 'effects', 'used', 'express', 'explosions', 'fail', 'convince', 'lacking', 'money', 'should', 'have', 'most', 'curious', 'thing', 'embassy', 'surrounded', 'insurgents', 'attack', 'always', 'one', 'side', 'block', 'namely', 'front', 'gate', 'quite', 'inexplicable.But', 'spite', 'lower', 'budget', 'Second', 'Commander', 'good', 'action', 'film', 'Perhaps', 'must', 'have', 'seen', 'everything', 'film', 'done', 'elsewhere', 'not', 'change', 'fact', 'film', 'enough', 'power', 'hold', 'attention']",N/A
