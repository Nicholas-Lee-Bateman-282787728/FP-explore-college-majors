940400,A16CZRQL23NOIW,B000BCDNWO,Hiram Gomez Pardo,"[0, 0]","A well renown playboy (Rock Hudson) blinds Jane Wymann in a car accident. Stricken by this fact , he reforms and becomes doctor to restore her sight. Thence among them a little love spark will begin to kindle although the well known of the selfish advises of her sons in order to leave him.There's more than a single aspect to keep in mind around this film. Douglas Sirk was one of the few filmmakers capable to make a gentle approach about the feminine universe as any other previous director before him. As a matter of fact we should not wonder this had been the director who most influenced to rainer Werner Fassbinder fifteen years  later.Far beyond the open finale in which one ignores what will be going on, underlies  the primary plot at least to me, that turns around the way her sons analyse and judge the future of her affective sentimental relation. They judge him but soon she made the crucial decision, every one of them followed their lives according their own interests forgetting their passionate defence respect their beloved mother. Sirk remarks so admirably this loneliness feeling through this unforgettable sequence on Christmas night.The other important plot is the road to redemption and self improvement as human being that experiences this man after that fatidic accident and the way he acquires consciousness about the real importance of the human condition and what it must figure as relevant along a human life.We are what we do (Goethe).",4,A touching movie with several dramatic premises!,1222300800,"09 25, 2008",2008,1466,"['well', 'renown', 'playboy', 'Rock', 'Hudson', 'Jane', 'Wymann', 'car', 'accident', 'Stricken', 'fact', 'doctor', 'restore', 'sight', 'Thence', 'little', 'love', 'spark', 'will', 'begin', 'kindle', 'well', 'known', 'selfish', 'advises', 'sons', 'order', 'leave', 'more', 'single', 'aspect', 'keep', 'mind', 'film', 'Douglas', 'Sirk', 'was', 'one', 'few', 'filmmakers', 'capable', 'make', 'gentle', 'approach', 'feminine', 'universe', 'other', 'previous', 'director', 'matter', 'fact', 'should', 'not', 'wonder', 'had', 'been', 'director', 'who', 'most', 'influenced', 'rainer', 'Werner', 'Fassbinder', 'fifteen', 'years', 'later.Far', 'open', 'finale', 'one', 'will', 'be', 'going', 'primary', 'plot', 'least', 'way', 'sons', 'analyse', 'judge', 'future', 'affective', 'sentimental', 'relation', 'judge', 'soon', 'made', 'crucial', 'decision', 'one', 'followed', 'lives', 'according', 'own', 'interests', 'forgetting', 'passionate', 'defence', 'respect', 'beloved', 'mother', 'Sirk', 'remarks', 'so', 'admirably', 'loneliness', 'feeling', 'unforgettable', 'sequence', 'Christmas', 'night.The', 'other', 'important', 'plot', 'road', 'redemption', 'self', 'improvement', 'human', 'being', 'man', 'fatidic', 'accident', 'way', 'consciousness', 'real', 'importance', 'human', 'condition', 'what', 'must', 'figure', 'relevant', 'human', 'life.We', 'are', 'what', 'do', 'Goethe']",N/A
