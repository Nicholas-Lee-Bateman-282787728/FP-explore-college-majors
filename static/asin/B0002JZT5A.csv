838402,A1GSR7RGCG1QYZ,B0002JZT5A,"A. Gyurisin ""good friend, damn fool""","[2, 2]","What an emotionless portrayal of an emotionless man.  Ewan yet again proves that he is a force in both the Hollywood community and in the independent forum.  Not only for having the bravery to go against American clich&eacute; and fight to keep his full frontal nudity in the film, but also for having the gumption to take this role.  This is not your average character.  Joe is not your normal ""hero"".  In fact, I would go so far as to say that he represents all of us.  He is, sadly, our ""hero"".  Joe (and Ewan portrays this perfectly) is constantly looking for happiness and acceptance, but somehow cannot find it due to the sexual urges that he has.  It is interesting to see him want to have emotion, but yet have no issues with sleeping with another man's wife.  This is a story of maturity for Joe, but sadly we do not ever see it.  When I was watching this film I was continually thinking of the film Alfie (not the new release, but the older) in which a man embarks on several relationships and ultimately ends up with nothing.  That is very similar to the story that we have here, only Young Adam is much grittier and darker ... and, well, more explicit.So many times in cinema we watch two actors give heartbreaking performances on screen, but just do not have the chemistry needed to really pull together those intense sex scenes.  That is not the case here.  The chemistry and raw emotion between Ewan and Tilda Swinton is phenomenal.  I have not seen a better match up in cinema in a long time.  This successfully added that extra intensity to their moments of glory.  I was able to feel and see their emotion and passion for each other on the screen.  It was exactly what this film needed to reach the next level.I know this story is based off a book, but I felt that director David Mackenzie did a fantastic job of setting the mood and the scenes.  He amazingly built this sense of claustrophobia that surrounded Joe from not only inside the boat, but also under the truck and in the second apartment.  There was even that feeling at the trial.  This claustrophobia is one of the reasons why Joe never stays in one place for very long.  While some will argue that he is nothing more than a heartless womanizer and a coward, I saw him as a tragic spirit searching for the lifelong happiness that he could never find.  His conscious was too heavy on him to ever find that perfect place.  Mackenzie allowed Ewan to find this character, and this powerful drama was transformed well into the screen.Finally, I would like to add that Ewan would not have been worth seeing in this film if it wasn't for the impressive Tilda Swinton who is seemingly in everything lately and gives nothing less than 110%.  I have not seen anything that she has been in that was anything below good.  She is our next Oscar winner and one of those actresses that are not afraid to get dirty.  Her portrayal of Ella is no different.  While others would have simply just played the part, Swinton creates the part and gives this film the backbone that it deserves.  She nearly steals every scene from Ewan, and that is impressive.Overall, Young Adam is a deeply disturbing and depressing film that is not for everyone, but will be enjoyed by those that are fans of this genre.Grade:  **** out of *****",4,Adam and Eve ... without the Tree!,1096156800,"09 26, 2004",2004,3287,"['What', 'emotionless', 'portrayal', 'emotionless', 'man', 'Ewan', 'yet', 'again', 'force', 'Hollywood', 'community', 'independent', 'forum', 'Not', 'only', 'having', 'bravery', 'go', 'American', 'clich', 'eacute', 'fight', 'keep', 'full', 'frontal', 'nudity', 'film', 'also', 'having', 'gumption', 'take', 'role', 'not', 'average', 'character', 'Joe', 'not', 'normal', 'hero', 'fact', 'would', 'go', 'so', 'far', 'say', 'sadly', 'hero', 'Joe', 'Ewan', 'perfectly', 'constantly', 'looking', 'happiness', 'acceptance', 'somehow', 'can', 'not', 'find', 'due', 'sexual', 'urges', 'interesting', 'see', 'want', 'have', 'emotion', 'yet', 'have', 'issues', 'sleeping', 'man', 'wife', 'story', 'maturity', 'Joe', 'sadly', 'do', 'not', 'ever', 'see', 'When', 'was', 'watching', 'film', 'was', 'continually', 'thinking', 'film', 'Alfie', 'not', 'new', 'release', 'older', 'man', 'several', 'relationships', 'ultimately', 'up', 'nothing', 'very', 'similar', 'story', 'have', 'here', 'only', 'Young', 'Adam', 'much', 'grittier', 'darker', 'well', 'more', 'explicit.So', 'many', 'times', 'cinema', 'watch', 'two', 'actors', 'give', 'heartbreaking', 'performances', 'screen', 'just', 'do', 'not', 'have', 'chemistry', 'needed', 'really', 'pull', 'together', 'intense', 'sex', 'scenes', 'not', 'case', 'here', 'chemistry', 'raw', 'emotion', 'Ewan', 'Tilda', 'Swinton', 'phenomenal', 'have', 'not', 'seen', 'better', 'match', 'up', 'cinema', 'long', 'time', 'successfully', 'added', 'extra', 'intensity', 'moments', 'glory', 'was', 'able', 'feel', 'see', 'emotion', 'passion', 'other', 'screen', 'was', 'exactly', 'what', 'film', 'needed', 'reach', 'next', 'level.I', 'know', 'story', 'based', 'off', 'book', 'felt', 'director', 'David', 'Mackenzie', 'did', 'fantastic', 'job', 'setting', 'mood', 'scenes', 'amazingly', 'built', 'sense', 'claustrophobia', 'surrounded', 'Joe', 'not', 'only', 'boat', 'also', 'truck', 'second', 'apartment', 'was', 'even', 'feeling', 'trial', 'claustrophobia', 'one', 'reasons', 'why', 'Joe', 'never', 'one', 'place', 'very', 'long', 'will', 'argue', 'nothing', 'more', 'heartless', 'womanizer', 'coward', 'saw', 'tragic', 'spirit', 'searching', 'lifelong', 'happiness', 'could', 'never', 'find', 'conscious', 'was', 'too', 'heavy', 'ever', 'find', 'perfect', 'place', 'Mackenzie', 'allowed', 'Ewan', 'find', 'character', 'powerful', 'drama', 'was', 'transformed', 'well', 'screen.Finally', 'would', 'like', 'add', 'Ewan', 'would', 'not', 'have', 'been', 'worth', 'seeing', 'film', 'was', ""n't"", 'impressive', 'Tilda', 'Swinton', 'who', 'seemingly', 'everything', 'lately', 'nothing', 'less', '110', '%', 'have', 'not', 'seen', 'anything', 'been', 'was', 'anything', 'good', 'next', 'Oscar', 'winner', 'one', 'actresses', 'are', 'not', 'afraid', 'get', 'dirty', 'portrayal', 'Ella', 'different', 'others', 'would', 'have', 'simply', 'just', 'played', 'part', 'Swinton', 'part', 'film', 'backbone', 'nearly', 'steals', 'scene', 'Ewan', 'impressive.Overall', 'Young', 'Adam', 'deeply', 'disturbing', 'depressing', 'film', 'not', 'everyone', 'will', 'be', 'enjoyed', 'are', 'fans', 'genre.Grade', '****', '*****']",N/A

I have always liked his performances, but I thought that this one was exceptional.  It tells the story of a failed writer who has a mysterious past with a woman that he abandoned. He works on a barge and begins an affair with his bosses' wife. It sort of is a mystery, but when it all comes down to it, this movie is basically an excuse to show as much sex as possible.(I have no objection to this!) There isn't a lot of dialogue, its more of what's not said that's important, and the story isn't really fast-paced, but if you get into to feeling of it, its actually pretty good.(One of my few objections is having to look at Tilda Swinton's hairy armpit.

838405,A2QHM5HBSIXRL4,B0002JZT5A,Andy Orrock,"[2, 3]","I'm a Ewan McGregor fan and thought 'Young Adam' was therefore worth at least a rental.  One of McGregor's best qualities as an actor is his willingness to play a cad as eagerly as the hero.And, he's quite the cad here as drifter/misogynist, Joe. Witness his callous and shocking abuse of Emily Mortimer's character (you'll never look at condiments the same way again).  Or - more central to the narrative of the film - his unthinking role in breaking up the marriage of his two employers.  Furthermore, what exactly does Joe know about the body floating in the river?  Will he step in the save the skin of an innocent man?  McGregor has established Joe's shallow character by that point.Overall, this film - from its subject matter, to the economic hardship of its protagonists, to the grey Scottish background, to the cinematography - is, in a word, bleak.  I'm not one for sappy, come-lift-us-up-where-we-belong endings, but there's absolutely not one smidgen of hope or redemption here.  [Even hard cases like the outstanding 'Maria Full of Grace' left us with an inkling of sunshine for Maria's future.]Then, there's the completely inscrutable title.  There's no Adam here, nor was there one in Alexander Trocchi's original novel.  The title must be an allusion to original sin.  I'm sure the movie's marketers were driven to fits having to sell that concept to the public.  The result? $767,373 in US box office (and less than $3M worldwide) according to Box Office Mojo for a film that ate up $6.4M in production costs alone to make.

838406,AORW1FRF4D4KS,B0002JZT5A,azindn,"[22, 23]","Ewan McGregor long ago proved he is an actor who often exceeds the screen material and leading ladies with whom he has been coupled. In Young Adam, the maturity of the actor matches the material, while an excellent supporting cast excels to create a solid film that could have been stunning in black and white format. The aimless and amoral character of Joe (McGregor) reflect in a subdued performance by McGregor that proves again he is one of the best of the younger British actors to come to the attention of film goers in the 90s. However, Young Adam is the kind of story most audiences won't warm to in its presentation of bleak 50s blue collar life that is unglamorous and dull. It is an existence that was neither fashionable nor trendy.Joe's daily routine lacks stimulation, so he finds it in a diversion with Ella (Tilda Swinton), the wife of his employer. Swinton is cast in the unglamorous role of a middle aged woman with ""thick ankles"" and it is a meaty role (sorry for the pun) which many Hollywood actresses yearn to play but haven't the chops. For Joe and Ella, their sexual trysts are far from an erotic session in the sheets. They are stolen moments, sweaty, and hurried. Joe's former girlfriend, whose corpse he hauls from the river at the film's opening, is a plain working class girl. In a fit of creative frustration, Joe douses her with custard and condiments for a moment of angry sex. Their romantic reunion months later is no more than a quickie with deadly results.Young Adam translates the short novel by Alexander Trocchi with a disenchanted eye to the era. It is a grimy film, quiet, and filled with the boredom of Glasgow coal barges, and of men and women whose lives turned to routine lacks color. In Young Adam, the characters meander into each other with a disinterested lust. One senses the aimlessness of Joe is the creation of his disinterest not only in others, but of life and what little it offers.Whatever notoriety was made by the press about McGregor's full-frontal nudity, it is no more than another quick flash already seen in earlier films like the Pillow Book and Velvet Goldmine. But, in context with the story, nudity, both male and female, is simply matter of fact -- no seduction or salacious fleshy views. McGregor's body lacks eroticism and underscores his character's amoral nature. Tilda Swinton is a tired woman with an impotent husband and hard life. Swinton's own stunning beauty and catlike face are hardened by the role, and she is outstanding as Ella. Emily Morton, Joe's old girlfriend, is too thin to be believable as a 50s woman, the era of curvaceous figures and chubby thighs; while her small role is also underwhelming. Peter Mullen gives another workmanlike performance as a cuckold spouse, the betrayal by his friend and wife an insult to his waning masculinity. The screenplay itself underwhelms but performances of McGregor and Swinton are worth viewing. Young Adam is a mature story with little nostalgia and romance, but good performances from the talented cast, it is worth viewing and deserves a place in film libraries.",5,A Tale of No Redemption,1134432000,"12 13, 2005",2005,3095,"['Ewan', 'McGregor', 'long', 'ago', 'proved', 'actor', 'who', 'often', 'screen', 'material', 'leading', 'ladies', 'whom', 'been', 'coupled', 'Young', 'Adam', 'maturity', 'actor', 'material', 'excellent', 'supporting', 'cast', 'excels', 'create', 'solid', 'film', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'stunning', 'black', 'white', 'format', 'aimless', 'amoral', 'character', 'Joe', 'McGregor', 'reflect', 'subdued', 'performance', 'McGregor', 'again', 'one', 'best', 'younger', 'British', 'actors', 'come', 'attention', 'film', 'goers', '90s', 'However', 'Young', 'Adam', 'kind', 'story', 'most', 'audiences', 'wo', ""n't"", 'warm', 'presentation', 'bleak', '50s', 'blue', 'collar', 'life', 'unglamorous', 'dull', 'existence', 'was', 'fashionable', 'trendy.Joe', 'daily', 'routine', 'stimulation', 'diversion', 'Ella', 'Tilda', 'Swinton', 'wife', 'employer', 'Swinton', 'cast', 'unglamorous', 'role', 'middle', 'aged', 'woman', 'thick', 'ankles', 'meaty', 'role', 'sorry', 'pun', 'many', 'Hollywood', 'actresses', 'yearn', 'play', 'have', ""n't"", 'chops', 'Joe', 'Ella', 'sexual', 'trysts', 'are', 'far', 'erotic', 'session', 'sheets', 'are', 'stolen', 'moments', 'sweaty', 'hurried', 'Joe', 'former', 'girlfriend', 'corpse', 'river', 'film', 'opening', 'plain', 'working', 'class', 'girl', 'fit', 'creative', 'frustration', 'Joe', 'custard', 'condiments', 'moment', 'angry', 'sex', 'romantic', 'reunion', 'months', 'later', 'more', 'quickie', 'deadly', 'results.Young', 'Adam', 'short', 'novel', 'Alexander', 'Trocchi', 'disenchanted', 'eye', 'era', 'grimy', 'film', 'quiet', 'filled', 'boredom', 'Glasgow', 'coal', 'barges', 'men', 'women', 'lives', 'turned', 'routine', 'lacks', 'color', 'Young', 'Adam', 'characters', 'meander', 'other', 'disinterested', 'lust', 'One', 'aimlessness', 'Joe', 'creation', 'disinterest', 'not', 'only', 'others', 'life', 'what', 'little', 'offers.Whatever', 'notoriety', 'was', 'made', 'press', 'McGregor', 'full-frontal', 'nudity', 'more', 'quick', 'flash', 'already', 'seen', 'earlier', 'films', 'Pillow', 'Book', 'Velvet', 'Goldmine', 'context', 'story', 'nudity', 'male', 'female', 'simply', 'matter', 'fact', 'seduction', 'salacious', 'fleshy', 'views', 'McGregor', 'body', 'eroticism', 'character', 'amoral', 'nature', 'Tilda', 'Swinton', 'tired', 'woman', 'impotent', 'husband', 'hard', 'life', 'Swinton', 'own', 'stunning', 'beauty', 'catlike', 'face', 'are', 'hardened', 'role', 'outstanding', 'Ella', 'Emily', 'Morton', 'Joe', 'old', 'girlfriend', 'too', 'thin', 'be', 'believable', '50s', 'woman', 'era', 'curvaceous', 'figures', 'chubby', 'thighs', 'small', 'role', 'also', 'underwhelming', 'Peter', 'Mullen', 'workmanlike', 'performance', 'cuckold', 'spouse', 'betrayal', 'friend', 'wife', 'insult', 'waning', 'masculinity', 'screenplay', 'underwhelms', 'performances', 'McGregor', 'Swinton', 'are', 'worth', 'viewing', 'Young', 'Adam', 'mature', 'story', 'little', 'nostalgia', 'romance', 'good', 'performances', 'talented', 'cast', 'worth', 'viewing', 'place', 'film', 'libraries']",N/A

DeRiemer,"[2, 2]","How would she have done it, asks Les Gault after he and Joe Taylor fished a dead woman clothed only in a petticoat from the cold water next to the barge Joe works on. She'd take off her coat and her blouse and her dress, Joe says, ""then shed her stockings and hold them out so that they blew in the breeze like pennants before she let them float off into the night. And she'd shiver and ask herself if she really wanted to go through with it. And she'd answer that question by kicking her clothes into the river. And hurriedly now she'd take off her garter and her knickers. And then she'd be standing in her petticoat thinking about whatever it was that brought her to this. And then with her petticoat billowing around her, she'd drop into the water like a rose and float there for a moment, and be gone."" Joe (Ewan McGregor) works for Les (Peter Mullan) and his wife, Ella (Tilda Swinton) on the Gault's barge as it hauls everything from coal to container drums along the canals from Glasgow. The police at first think the girl, Cathy Dimly (Emily Mortimer) was a suicide, but then find she was pregnant and accuse a married man she knew of murder. Please note: Elements of the plot are discussed.Joe's vision of Cathy's last moments is mesmerizing and dead wrong. She was undressed because, a few moments before, she and Joe were having sex on the dirt in a dockyard next to the river. She was pregnant, not by her married friend, but by Joe. She drowned because when Joe walked away from her she ran after him, lost her balance and fell in the river. Joe called her name a few times, but then threw her clothes into the river after her and hurried away.Joe Taylor is a drifter. He wants to be a writer but doesn't work at it. He thinks as much with what's between his legs as with what's between his ears. He's passive in many ways, except when it comes to women. He was having sex with Cathy soon after they met. He began having sex with Ella, the tired, frustrated wife of Les and who turns out to own the barge, one evening when Joe went into town to play darts. ""Are you sorry?"" Joe asks her afterwards. ""Fat lot of good that would do,"" Ella says as she walks back to the barge. Joe has sex with Ella's sister-in-law while still supposedly committed to Ella and shortly after the sister-in-law becomes a widow. He has sex with the married landlady where he stays after leaving the barge. The sex is passionate but joyless, against an alley wall, along the side of a canal, in the small bed of the barge where Ella's young son peeps through a crack in the wall. Joe can have what he wants, and he does, but with little personal involvement.Joe knows the man on trial is innocent. At the last moment he writes an anonymous letter telling what actually happened. The man is found guilty anyway and condemned to hang. Joe finally just walks away.Is that all there is? Yes and no. I found the movie frustrating because there was little emotional payoff for the viewer. Joe is not an especially bad guy, but he has no particular redeeming qualities. Sex comes easily for him, but doing something -- anything -- seems beyond his limit of selfishness. It makes for a movie that, I think, is intriguing to watch but not very involving.On the other side of that argument are two strong elements. First, the look and style of the movie is first-rate. Everything about the movie is cold, overcast or raining and coal-begrimed. The love-making, with both female and male frontal nudity, is quick and efficient. There's no sentimentality here. Everyone smokes and you can sense the reek of stale cigarette breath. So much of the action takes place on the claustrophobic barge that it's not long before you want to take a deep breath of fresh air. Second, add to that some wonderful performances, especially by Tilda Swinton and Peter Mullan. If you want a glimpse of Swinton's enormous talent, look at her in two wildly different movies, Love Is the Devil and The Deep End, and then compare here. She's amazing.

I just finished watching this movie, and while the story itself is decent, it's ruined by the lack of attention it receives.  The story of a young man Joe (McGregor) who finds his dead lover face down in the water is intriguing in itself.  The story forces the actions of Joe upon all those whom he meets and befriends, especially Les and Ella (Peter Mullan & Tilda Swinton), the couple whom he lives with, working on their barge in Scotland.  The movie could have approached this film by picking apart the inner human in these central characters but instead it focus's on an elicit affair between Joe and Ella, showing the two having sex numorus times without any rhyme or reason.  In fact, almost 80% of this film is sex related, yet it never really explains what triggered the affair, why Joe has sex with everyone he meets, why Ella prefers Joe to her husband...and most importantly it just skirts around the murder of Joe's ex-lover (Emily Mortimer) only really tackling it at the end of the film.  It's not a terrible movie, I just feel they lost it's potential amidst all the shock-antics they obviously felt compelled to do.

Oh, it's full of mood and the acting is quite good, but that isn't enough to save this film from itself.Joe (Ewan McGregor) and Les (Peter Mulan) and Tilda Swinton all work a barge that Swinton owns. Les is married to her and they share a son. No one in this film is named Adam!Now, Joe and Les drag up the dead body of a young woman from the river. She is quite dead. Ostensibly this is the driving force behind the film. It isn't.What drives this film is Joe's insatiable sexual appetite. In fact, Joe merely wanders through the film without any conscience sleeping with women - married or otherwise. He's such a perv that he even sniffs one woman's bed sheets where her crotch would have been.Behind the scenes, he keeps up with the status of the investigation and subsequent trial of the person accused of murdering the young woman he and Les pulled out of the drink.There is no resolution in this film. There is no real plot - we don't learn anything new or discover some stunning revelation as a result of the finish of the film.It is more a character study never finished.Tilda Swinton is a fine actress, but even when glammed up she is very hard on the eyes. Here she wears no makeup and quite often no clothes.McGregor is doing his typical performance which is better than many actors, but not as good as could be. He seems to relish the opportunity to expose his privates on screen and in this film we see a bit more than we bargained for in the sex scenes - they are almost pornographic.At one point Swinton's son peeks through cracks in the wall to see his mother and her lover having sex. Nothing comes of this. Why did we need to see this? Shouldn't it have some bearing on the film as a whole? Nope. It's just there for effect.And that is really what this whole film is: effect.

The story is bleak, the characters, almost all of them despicable are impossible to route for.  Tilda Swinton, an actress I normally find attractive, is here, as Ella, a ghastly, tough, worn out creature and a bit of a shrew.  Joe, as portrayed  by Ewan McGregor (one of my favorite actors) gives his all as a too young to be this world weary, callow man who, having given up his dreams and fantasies of a better life, aimlessly goes through life, with no honor or self respect.  For a bit of adventure he bangs nearly every woman in sight.  In fact, a betting game can be played whenever a new female character is introduced as to how many minutes before we're having to see their contorted naked bodies going at itBargemates Joe and Les's (an excellent performance by multi talented actor/writer/director Peter Mullan, who's ""Orphans"" is one of the best things from Scotland in ages) discovery of a dead girl at the film's start, unravels the story in achingly slow fashion and paints an increasingly disturbing picture of Joe.  One always wants to route for a film's hero but ""Young Adam"" doesn't have one.

838415,A328S9RN3U5M68,B0002JZT5A,Grady Harp,"[4, 5]","The haunting beauty of Alexander Trocchi's book YOUNG ADAM was in the descriptive language, a gift of creating the atmospheric visual from the use of carefully chosen words.  In collaborating with Trocchi by making the book visual, writer/director David Mackenzie has succeeded in capturing the atmosphere of working class Scotland circa 1950 with all the dank and dark meanderings of a river barge outside of Glasgow on the river Clyde, the scene of all the action in this unique mystery of death and passion and lust.  And for the most part Mackenzie relies on the camera to absorb and illuminate the characters and the nearly unbearable story that lurks beneath the murky water's surface.  And God created Adam: man, young Adam learning of physical desires that he hopes will inform his chosen career of writing 'different' books.  Joe is this young Adam, a man from middle to upper class Glasgow who has been to university to learn his craft then sets out to experience the world.  We first meet him (as played with incredible subtlety and animal magnetism by Ewan McGregor) observing the floating body of a young woman, face down in the river. His co-worker Les (Peter Mullan) helps Joe fish her out of the river and call the ambulance.  Switch to a smarmy working barge owned by Ella (the amazingly gifted Tilda Swinton who is not afraid to tackle ANY role and make it credible), who happens to married to Les, and is the dingy home of Joe as he descends into the poor working class of Scotland.  Through no dialogue and only eye communication between them, Joe seduces Ella in the beginning of a never-ending series of spontaneous sexual encounters with nearly every woman who enters the picture. In a series of flashbacks we gradually learn that the woman fished from the river was Cathie (Emily Mortimer), a sexual liaison of Joe's and Joe is troubled by the memory of her accidental drowning, though he speaks of it to no one.  Joe's and Ella's affair is discovered by Les, and Les leaves the barge home he has known, allowing Ella and Joe to continue their lusty affair unafraid.  But things happen, the death of Cathie is investigated by the police and a trial is held, condemning another man to hanging for the 'murder' of Cathie.  The tragedy is the emotional distance with which Joe isolates himself from not only fact of deed, but from any sense of personal involvement with the multiple sexual partners he has.The story may be cold and depressing, but the character of Joe is a careful examination of one man's survival in a world he seeks to understand.  There is a metaphor or two here about where we have come as sexual beings and as citizens of a non-compassionate world.  The film can be appreciated on many levels.  Yes, there is depiction of Joe's type of instant gratification sex: it is darkly graphic, and there is full frontal nudity of (yes, believe it or not!) BOTH Joe and his consorts - something unusual for American audiences.  But the dark coarseness of the lust only underlines the overall story, a story that is so well developed with minimal dialogue that it is completely absorbing.  None of this could have been possible without the stunning performances by Ewan McGregor and Tilda Swinton, two actors who understand the power of understatement.  Perhaps not a film for everyone, but for those who are hungry for dark stories and richly detailed canvases on film, this film is highly recommended.  Of note, an 'added feature' on the DVD shows how the film was originally intended to have voice-over by McGregor, who reveals some of the beauty of Trocchi's original writing.

Ewan yet again proves that he is a force in both the Hollywood community and in the independent forum. Not only for having the bravery to go against American clich&eacute; and fight to keep his full frontal nudity in the film, but also for having the gumption to take this role. To me there's nothing ""young"" about this character, he was a mature man that desperately needed to find himself and clear his conscience. This movie should of been called ""Lost Adam"" or Guilty conscience Adam."" The cover of this DVD doesn't serve him any justice.Joe is not your normal 'hero' or character. In fact, I would go as far as to say he represents some of us. He is, sadly, our 'hero'. Joe (and Ewan portrays this perfectly) is constantly looking for happiness and acceptance, but somehow cannot find it due to the sexual urges that he has. It is interesting to see him want to have emotion, but yet have no issues with sleeping with another man's wife. This is a story of maturity for Joe, but sadly we do not ever see it. When I was watching this film I was continually thinking of the film Alfie (not the new release, but the older) in which a man embarks on several relationships and ultimately ends up with nothing. That is very similar to the story that we have here, only Young Adam is much grittier and darker ... and, well, more explicit.The plot, what little of it there is, unfolds through character and behavior, with a minimum of dialog. There is much complete silence in this film.  There is a quiet suspense, never quite gratified, which begins with the very first frame, a corpse, gently floating, photographed darkly, from below, so dark there is no face. A deceased, faceless female human being. Joe's is the first face we see. That first glimpse of his eyes, told me that nothing would be what it seemed in this film. Joe sees something we do not see. So begins the mystery.Nothing is jarring, nothing is false. Life is simply never quite what we think it is. Make no mistake. There is a real mystery here to be revealed. Not a contrived, plot dependent series of revelations. It is the unpeeling of the layers of a human being. I haven't told you much about the plot. That is deliberate. The plot works. It reveals the character. The progression of events is true, often surprising, but never false, never contrived.If you love great acting, by all involved, and appreciate the crafts and arts of film construction, I recommend ""Young Adam"".",3,"Young Adam is a deeply disturbing and depressing film that is not for everyone,",1149984000,"06 11, 2006",2006,2503,"['What', 'emotionless', 'portrayal', 'emotionless', 'man', 'Ewan', 'yet', 'again', 'force', 'Hollywood', 'community', 'independent', 'forum', 'Not', 'only', 'having', 'bravery', 'go', 'American', 'clich', 'eacute', 'fight', 'keep', 'full', 'frontal', 'nudity', 'film', 'also', 'having', 'gumption', 'take', 'role', 'nothing', 'young', 'character', 'was', 'mature', 'man', 'desperately', 'needed', 'find', 'clear', 'conscience', 'movie', 'should', 'been', 'called', 'Lost', 'Adam', 'Guilty', 'conscience', 'Adam', 'cover', 'DVD', ""n't"", 'serve', 'justice.Joe', 'not', 'normal', ""'hero"", 'character', 'fact', 'would', 'go', 'as', 'far', 'say', 'sadly', ""'hero"", 'Joe', 'Ewan', 'perfectly', 'constantly', 'looking', 'happiness', 'acceptance', 'somehow', 'can', 'not', 'find', 'due', 'sexual', 'urges', 'interesting', 'see', 'want', 'have', 'emotion', 'yet', 'have', 'issues', 'sleeping', 'man', 'wife', 'story', 'maturity', 'Joe', 'sadly', 'do', 'not', 'ever', 'see', 'When', 'was', 'watching', 'film', 'was', 'continually', 'thinking', 'film', 'Alfie', 'not', 'new', 'release', 'older', 'man', 'several', 'relationships', 'ultimately', 'up', 'nothing', 'very', 'similar', 'story', 'have', 'here', 'only', 'Young', 'Adam', 'much', 'grittier', 'darker', 'well', 'more', 'explicit.The', 'plot', 'what', 'unfolds', 'character', 'behavior', 'minimum', 'dialog', 'much', 'complete', 'silence', 'film', 'quiet', 'suspense', 'never', 'quite', 'gratified', 'very', 'first', 'frame', 'corpse', 'gently', 'floating', 'photographed', 'darkly', 'so', 'dark', 'face', 'deceased', 'faceless', 'female', 'human', 'being', 'Joe', 'first', 'face', 'see', 'first', 'glimpse', 'eyes', 'told', 'nothing', 'would', 'be', 'what', 'seemed', 'film', 'Joe', 'something', 'do', 'not', 'see', 'So', 'mystery.Nothing', 'jarring', 'nothing', 'false', 'Life', 'simply', 'never', 'quite', 'what', 'think', 'Make', 'mistake', 'real', 'mystery', 'here', 'be', 'revealed', 'Not', 'contrived', 'plot', 'dependent', 'series', 'revelations', 'unpeeling', 'layers', 'human', 'being', 'have', ""n't"", 'told', 'much', 'plot', 'deliberate', 'plot', 'character', 'progression', 'events', 'true', 'often', 'surprising', 'never', 'false', 'never', 'contrived.If', 'love', 'great', 'acting', 'involved', 'appreciate', 'crafts', 'arts', 'film', 'construction', 'recommend', 'Young', 'Adam']",N/A

838422,A270RZKNJS04C1,B0002JZT5A,"Mary Kean ""Valkyrie911""","[5, 7]","I'm ammending this from my origninal review at the bottom*Ok first let's get the artsy people out of the way.I can appreciate good cinematography. There comes a time when we have to cross a line between establishing the bleak, sameness of a situation and calling it setting up the backdrop of the shot. I'm going to go way out on a limb here and say that the weather and lighting conditions where they were shooting are pretty much the same every single damn day of the year, with a break or 2 here and there, so let's drop the camera work right now because that is hardly what this film is about.A while back I read that Ewan McGregor had taken an awful role that was basically about nothing and went nowhere but he had a lot of sex in the movie.  Being a Ewan fan I found this rather intriguing. I had actually almost forgotten about it until it showed up on cable one night. Seeing it co-starred Tilda Swinton I thought what I read must have been exaggerated, because she is known for choosing her roles careully.The story unfolds as the men, Ewan and Ela's husband Lars, find a nearly nude dead body of a young woman whilst they are delivering goods on Ela's barge in Scotland. The body is handed over to the authorities and we are privy to domestic life aboard the barge. A child and the heavy drinking of her husband leaves Tilda Swinton's character less than satisfied, and Ewan's Joe is soon to take full advantage of her lonliness.Events begin to unfold both in present time and flashback and we learn that Joe, while not a murderer, is not completely innocent in the death of the young girl they found drowned at the beginning of the movie. We also find that he is not an ardent lover as Ela seems to believe, just an opportunist who will have sex with any woman who is willing and ready.On the outside he seems an everyman, just a regular Joe, but inside seethes a failed writer who seemingly hates women and in one repugnant, sadistic scene belittles the poor woman who is too in love with him to see who he really is.He makes a half-hearted attempt to be decent at times but it is robotic, more or less going through the motions. He is willing at very turn to make his mess and walk away from it untouched. He is a repulsive person behind the facade of the everyman.I cannot see what drew either Ewan McGregor or Tilda Swinton to doing this film. They have scenes of sex, not lovemaking, and it is as though the director said ""Tilda, stick your belly out so we know you've had children, make your body as ugly as possible""-and this is a beautiful woman!A lot of people play up Ewan McGregor's nudity in films. By now they should get over it. He's showed skin in almost everything he has done and he does in this movie also. It lasts about 1 second and looks the same as it always does. I'm never surprised that he does nudity, but I'm surprised when he takes on a role like this.This film has no redeeming merits at all except that you are repulsed enough to keep watching it the entire way through.*I have to say that for some reason as repulsed as I am by this movie I still watch it over and over. It has an almost mesmerizing quality to it. Having met Ewan McGregor in person he looks more himself in this than he has in any film he's been in in a long time. Maybe it is because the setting is so dull and unchanging, (it's like that in reality too) or that the people are so washed out. I don't know. I think it has to be the acting although so minimal it is almost not even there that draws one in.Nothing has changed about the characters. I still find them all to be either faintly or grotesqly repulsive; Joe's final ""triumph"" more obscene every time I view it.However, because there is something there that has this effect I'm going to bump it up to 4 stars. I still caution anyone with an easily troubled conscious (maybe that is my problem) about seeing this film. Spoiler alert-To give you an idea one scene involves a recent widow in an alley with Joe. After a few seconds she bends down to pick up her still burning cigrette complaining about the mess Joe's made of her as he zips up. They then return to Ela'a barge for tea.That is typical of the lack of morality in the characters. You're disgusted by them at the same time you are fascinted by them.So watch at your own risk, just don't expect a happy ending-unless you're Joe.",3,Young Joe Smoe and he likes it that way,1117497600,"05 31, 2005",2005,4357,"[""'m"", 'ammending', 'origninal', 'review', 'bottom*Ok', 'first', 'let', 'get', 'artsy', 'people', 'way.I', 'can', 'appreciate', 'good', 'cinematography', 'time', 'when', 'have', 'cross', 'line', 'establishing', 'bleak', 'sameness', 'situation', 'calling', 'setting', 'up', 'backdrop', 'shot', ""'m"", 'going', 'go', 'way', 'limb', 'here', 'say', 'weather', 'lighting', 'conditions', 'where', 'were', 'shooting', 'are', 'pretty', 'much', 'same', 'single', 'damn', 'day', 'year', 'break', '2', 'here', 'there', 'let', 'drop', 'camera', 'work', 'right', 'now', 'hardly', 'what', 'film', 'about.A', 'back', 'read', 'Ewan', 'McGregor', 'had', 'taken', 'awful', 'role', 'was', 'basically', 'nothing', 'went', 'nowhere', 'had', 'lot', 'sex', 'movie', 'Being', 'Ewan', 'fan', 'found', 'rather', 'intriguing', 'had', 'actually', 'almost', 'forgotten', 'showed', 'up', 'cable', 'one', 'night', 'Seeing', 'co-starred', 'Tilda', 'Swinton', 'thought', 'what', 'read', 'must', 'have', 'been', 'exaggerated', 'known', 'choosing', 'roles', 'careully.The', 'story', 'unfolds', 'men', 'Ewan', 'Ela', 'husband', 'Lars', 'find', 'nearly', 'nude', 'dead', 'body', 'young', 'woman', 'are', 'delivering', 'goods', 'Ela', 'barge', 'Scotland', 'body', 'handed', 'authorities', 'are', 'privy', 'domestic', 'life', 'barge', 'child', 'heavy', 'drinking', 'husband', 'Tilda', 'Swinton', 'character', 'less', 'satisfied', 'Ewan', 'Joe', 'soon', 'take', 'full', 'advantage', 'lonliness.Events', 'begin', 'unfold', 'present', 'time', 'flashback', 'learn', 'Joe', 'not', 'murderer', 'not', 'completely', 'innocent', 'death', 'young', 'girl', 'found', 'drowned', 'beginning', 'movie', 'also', 'find', 'not', 'ardent', 'lover', 'Ela', 'believe', 'just', 'opportunist', 'who', 'will', 'have', 'sex', 'woman', 'who', 'willing', 'outside', 'everyman', 'just', 'regular', 'Joe', 'inside', 'failed', 'writer', 'who', 'seemingly', 'women', 'one', 'repugnant', 'sadistic', 'scene', 'poor', 'woman', 'who', 'too', 'love', 'see', 'who', 'really', 'is.He', 'half-hearted', 'attempt', 'be', 'decent', 'times', 'robotic', 'more', 'less', 'going', 'motions', 'willing', 'very', 'turn', 'make', 'mess', 'walk', 'away', 'untouched', 'repulsive', 'person', 'facade', 'everyman.I', 'can', 'not', 'see', 'what', 'drew', 'Ewan', 'McGregor', 'Tilda', 'Swinton', 'doing', 'film', 'have', 'scenes', 'sex', 'not', 'lovemaking', 'director', 'said', 'Tilda', 'stick', 'belly', 'out', 'know', ""'ve"", 'had', 'children', 'make', 'body', 'as', 'ugly', 'possible', '-and', 'beautiful', 'woman', 'lot', 'people', 'play', 'up', 'Ewan', 'McGregor', 'nudity', 'films', 'now', 'should', 'get', 'showed', 'skin', 'almost', 'everything', 'done', 'movie', 'also', '1', 'second', 'same', 'always', ""'m"", 'never', 'surprised', 'nudity', ""'m"", 'surprised', 'when', 'role', 'this.This', 'film', 'redeeming', 'merits', 'are', 'repulsed', 'enough', 'keep', 'watching', 'entire', 'way', '*I', 'have', 'say', 'reason', 'as', 'repulsed', 'am', 'movie', 'still', 'watch', 'almost', 'mesmerizing', 'quality', 'Having', 'met', 'Ewan', 'McGregor', 'person', 'more', 'film', 'been', 'long', 'time', 'Maybe', 'setting', 'so', 'dull', 'unchanging', 'reality', 'too', 'people', 'are', 'so', 'washed', 'out', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'think', 'be', 'acting', 'so', 'minimal', 'almost', 'not', 'even', 'one', 'in.Nothing', 'changed', 'characters', 'still', 'find', 'be', 'either', 'faintly', 'grotesqly', 'repulsive', 'Joe', 'final', 'triumph', 'more', 'obscene', 'time', 'view', 'it.However', 'something', 'there', 'effect', ""'m"", 'going', 'bump', '4', 'stars', 'still', 'caution', 'anyone', 'easily', 'troubled', 'conscious', 'maybe', 'problem', 'seeing', 'film', 'Spoiler', 'alert-To', 'give', 'idea', 'one', 'scene', 'recent', 'widow', 'alley', 'Joe', 'few', 'seconds', 'down', 'pick', 'up', 'still', 'burning', 'cigrette', 'complaining', 'mess', 'Joe', 'made', 'up', 'then', 'return', 'Ela', 'barge', 'tea.That', 'typical', 'lack', 'morality', 'characters', ""'re"", 'disgusted', 'same', 'time', 'are', 'fascinted', 'them.So', 'watch', 'own', 'risk', 'just', 'do', ""n't"", 'expect', 'happy', 'ending-unless', ""'re"", 'Joe']",N/A
838423,A3UPYGJKZ0XTU4,B0002JZT5A,mirasreviews,"[3, 3]","David Mackenzie wrote and directed ""Young Adam"" based on the novel by Alexander Trocchi. In 1950s Scotland, a young man named Joe (Ewan McGregor) works on a barge that travels the River Clyde, in the employ of lifelong bargers Ella and Les Gault (Tilda Swinton & Peter Mullan). One day the two men find a woman's body floating in the river. They keep apprised of the investigation into the woman's death through the newspapers, as the relationships between Joe, Ella, and Les change within the confines of the barge.""Young Adam"" is a kind of plodding film noir. There are mystery, twists of fate that bring sudden change, a pervasive sense of injustice, and a cast of simple but well-drawn characters, none of whom are blameless or admirable, but who all have sympathetic moments. We see the story from Joe's perspective, and that makes an interesting character study. But ""Young Adam"" has -I suppose deliberately- the pace of the slow, monotonous barge life that it depicts. A significant portion of the story is in flashbacks, which are surreptitiously slipped into the present narrative, so it's often not immediately apparent that they are flashbacks. Conversation is sparse and sometimes disjointed. The film is very heavy on atmosphere in places, to the point that it detracts from the relationships. But the cast is excellent.Tilda Swinton can be very refined, but here she is plain, rough and barely working class. Ella is probably the film's most interesting character: a woman who never expected much out of life, but jumps at an opportunity for a little change, not caring much what it is. Ewan McGregor does a fine job of keeping the audience unsure of Joe's moral character. Peter Mullan is perfection in his supporting role as a simple, not particularly  bad man who is not a particularly good husband either. It's interesting to watch relationships within a closed space. And I like the idea of a noir set as far away from urban culture and sophistication as you can get. ""Young Adam"" is intriguing, but it takes patience. 3 1/2 stars.The DVD (Columbia/Tristar 2004): Bonus features include 2 audio commentaries, one extended scene, and some voice-over narration. The first audio commentary by ""Cast and Crew"" features director David Mackenzie, editor Colin Monie, production designer Laurence Dorman, and actress Tilda Swinton. They talk to each other about their roles and unique challenges in working on the film, including adapting the story from the novel and the treatment of the flashback sequences.  The second audio commentary is by director David Mackenzie alone, in which he talks about the decisions he made and challenges posed by the locations and circumstances. This commentary focuses on the filming itself. The ""Extended Scene"" is a very slightly extended version of a scene between Ella and Joe. ""Ewan McGregor Original Passage Narration"" is three short segments of voiceover narration that McGregor recorded for the film, but which did not make the final cut. The narration really is superfluous, so no loss there.

838424,A2C7Y2UIH03UKJ,B0002JZT5A,"Nicole Victoria ""nicole""","[5, 6]","Set in post WWII Scotland, Young Adam is a tale of deception and murder that creeps along like a steady rolling fog.Ewan McGregor is Joe, an emotionally absent young drifter who finds work on a barge owned by Les (Peter Mullan) and his reticent wife Ella (Tilda Swinton).When Joe and Les pull the corpse of a young woman out of a canal, it seems initially a random event for the barge workers. Police begin searching for the woman's killer while Joe finds himself drifting toward Ella. The tension between the two heats up and when a lust fuelled affair begins it becomes apparent Joe is hiding some dark secrets from his past.Although not quite a thriller, Young Adam has all the ingredients of a dark and moody drama. Scotland's steamy canals are the perfect desolate backdrop for what is basically a story about morals - those of both the community and the individual.It`s clear director David McKenzie made some inspired casting decisions when choosing his lead performers in this film, as they become the back bone of this emotional tale.Perhaps it`s McGregor's Scottish heritage that takes some of the credit for his complete embodiment of Joe; brooding, opportunistic and confident, he attracts women like the proverbial moth to the flame. McGregor's subtly in playing Joe, makes it impossible to find the seam between actor and character.Swinton dons the dowdy garb of a third generation barge owner and disappears into the strong yet vulnerable Ella. The role is a far cry from her characters in films such as Orlando and The Beach, but it seems clear by her portrayal of Ella that she revels in a challenge.Containing all the right elements Young Adam is a first rate film, however this does not mean it is comfortable to watch. Not that it should be. It's a story which explores some perilous notions most of us would choose to shy away from.Young Adam is a difficult journey but one not without its rewards.",4,Dark and classically Scottish,1131580800,"11 10, 2005",2005,1919,"['Set', 'post', 'WWII', 'Scotland', 'Young', 'Adam', 'tale', 'deception', 'murder', 'steady', 'rolling', 'fog.Ewan', 'McGregor', 'Joe', 'emotionally', 'absent', 'young', 'drifter', 'who', 'work', 'barge', 'owned', 'Les', 'Peter', 'Mullan', 'reticent', 'wife', 'Ella', 'Tilda', 'Swinton', '.When', 'Joe', 'Les', 'pull', 'corpse', 'young', 'woman', 'canal', 'initially', 'random', 'event', 'barge', 'workers', 'Police', 'begin', 'searching', 'woman', 'killer', 'Joe', 'drifting', 'Ella', 'tension', 'two', 'heats', 'up', 'when', 'lust', 'fuelled', 'affair', 'apparent', 'Joe', 'hiding', 'dark', 'secrets', 'past.Although', 'not', 'quite', 'thriller', 'Young', 'Adam', 'ingredients', 'dark', 'moody', 'drama', 'Scotland', 'steamy', 'canals', 'are', 'perfect', 'desolate', 'backdrop', 'what', 'basically', 'story', 'morals', 'community', 'individual.It', 's', 'clear', 'director', 'David', 'McKenzie', 'made', 'inspired', 'casting', 'decisions', 'when', 'choosing', 'lead', 'performers', 'film', 'become', 'back', 'bone', 'emotional', 'tale.Perhaps', 's', 'McGregor', 'Scottish', 'heritage', 'credit', 'complete', 'embodiment', 'Joe', 'brooding', 'opportunistic', 'confident', 'women', 'proverbial', 'moth', 'flame', 'McGregor', 'subtly', 'playing', 'Joe', 'impossible', 'find', 'seam', 'actor', 'character.Swinton', 'dons', 'dowdy', 'garb', 'third', 'generation', 'barge', 'owner', 'strong', 'yet', 'vulnerable', 'Ella', 'role', 'far', 'cry', 'characters', 'films', 'such', 'Orlando', 'Beach', 'clear', 'portrayal', 'Ella', 'challenge.Containing', 'right', 'elements', 'Young', 'Adam', 'first', 'rate', 'film', 'however', 'not', 'mean', 'comfortable', 'watch', 'Not', 'should', 'be', 'story', 'perilous', 'notions', 'most', 'would', 'choose', 'shy', 'away', 'from.Young', 'Adam', 'difficult', 'journey', 'one', 'not', 'rewards']",N/A
838425,A20NJAPECFGIR9,B0002JZT5A,"nina ""Movie Maiden""","[5, 9]","I say the film is unique because it has nothing to hold your interest but it apparently does.  I haven't read the book but the movie would have been the most tastless thing since Show Girls, Disclosure and Body of Evidence if it hadn't shown the reality it had within the characters and plot of the film.The film is so gritty and the people so dirty-looking and filthy that you have to award the director for at least taking the time to show how people on an overseas barge really live. Mackenzie was true to life. He didn't sit a beautiful woman with manicured nails on the barge with a bikini like some directors would have.  He chose Tilda Swinton, who may not be society's conventional beauty but carries herself in a way that's so enchanting you can see why Joe ( Ewan McGregor ) can't wait to get a piece of her. Swinton isn't beautiful but she is sexy and if you don't know the difference between the two, that's your problem.  A reviewer stated that a hunk like McGregor wouldn't want Tilda Swinton. Well if you watched the film carefully, you'll see that Joe ( McGregor ) was no prize himself. Joe may have been good looking but seemed slow and slightly retarded by the way he drifted off by himself. He wasn't anywhere near Ella's intelligence.  Joe was a dumb seaman and McGregor played the part well.I for one are sick of no-acting pretty faces and was glad David didn't stick one in this. Swinton is a fine actress. She and McGregor had exciting chemistry.  When they had sex, I didn't find myself thinking of the actual act. I found myself reveling in the chemistry and magnitude these actors had. THIS alone keeps the film going because without this chemistry I wouldn't have watched it twice.  I agree that the sex gets tiresome after the third romp and it goes from semi-romantic to XXX porn by the end of the film.  Like I said, I didn't read the novel but I can't imagine it having as much sex in it as this. We didn't have to see every single time they had sex.  We knew they were having an affair so enough is enough. I found the frontal nudity too realistic and not needed. It cheapened the movie. I found seeing Tilda Swinton naked completely nauseating ( not because of how she looked but because by this point it seemed that Ella didn't care about her child at all, just romping around naked like a teenager ).  And no I don't think seeing Swinton naked added anything to the movie.This is a mixed bag. I bought it before seeing it so that should tell you something.  If I saw it first I probably wouldn't have bought it.  It's not up there with even the top 100 of my favorite films but it's not really bad, just it has to suit your particular tastes.  My opinion is there was way too much sex, the actors mumbled so you couldn't hear much of what they were saying. There were too many conflicting accents that made it impossible to keep up with the characters. The flashbacks should have been done in black and white.  I couldn't tell a flashback from the present until about five minutes back into the film and rhe film was way too long. If foreign noir is your thing you'll probably enjoy this.  If not, skip it or watch it with your hand on the fast forward button.

Life on the barge is very limited and basic as Joe must share tight living accomodations with the husband and wife team that own and operate the boat.

The wife and pretty well most of the women Joe meets seem to treat sex with about as much mystery and expectations as shaking hands.The writer and the director do not go out of their way to make these people seem appealing but rather slowly develop the shallowness of character as the viewer becomes aware that Joe had more than a passing knowledge of the unidentified girl whose dead body they pulled out of the river right after the opening credits......Certainly we find that most of the characters have the morals of alley cats, very limited intellectual or cummunicative skills, no real compassion for anything more than themselves ....under normal circumstances I would have hated the movie for the disgusting character traits, but, it was so well done the viewer walks away thinking ... would I have been any different in the same circumstances .... probably not ... and thats the beauty of the film ...",5,A dark and brooding drama and character study ...,1100563200,"11 16, 2004",2004,1778,"['be', 'able', 'enjoy', 'movie', 'viewer', 'should', 'be', 'forewarned', 'not', 'full', 'plasticized', 'air', 'brushed', 'men', 'women', 'characters', 'are', '1950', 'working', 'class', 'neighbourhoods', 'Scotland', 'such', 'do', ""n't"", 'expect', 'many', 'viwes', 'rolling', 'hills', 'sunlight', 'meaningfull', 'conversations', 'fine', 'art', 'existentialism', '.The', 'main', 'charater', 'played', 'Ewan', 'McGregor', 'Joe', 'drifter', 'just', 'starting', 'work', 'coal', 'barge', 'plying', 'small', 'rivers', 'backwaters', 'Scotland', 'Life', 'barge', 'very', 'limited', 'basic', 'Joe', 'must', 'share', 'tight', 'living', 'accomodations', 'husband', 'wife', 'team', 'own', 'operate', 'boat', 'really', 'only', 'matter', 'day', 'son', 'Joe', 'seduce', 'wife', 'who', 'very', 'slight', 'resistance', 'advances', 'say', 'trysts', 'are', 'unromantic', 'cold', 'pretty', 'matter', 'fact', 'would', 'be', 'understatement', 'wife', 'pretty', 'well', 'most', 'women', 'Joe', 'meets', 'seem', 'treat', 'sex', 'about', 'much', 'mystery', 'expectations', 'shaking', 'hands.The', 'writer', 'director', 'do', 'not', 'go', 'way', 'make', 'people', 'seem', 'appealing', 'rather', 'slowly', 'develop', 'shallowness', 'character', 'viewer', 'aware', 'Joe', 'had', 'more', 'passing', 'knowledge', 'unidentified', 'girl', 'dead', 'body', 'pulled', 'out', 'river', 'right', 'opening', 'credits', 'Certainly', 'find', 'most', 'characters', 'have', 'morals', 'alley', 'cats', 'very', 'limited', 'intellectual', 'cummunicative', 'skills', 'real', 'compassion', 'anything', 'more', '.under', 'normal', 'circumstances', 'would', 'have', 'hated', 'movie', 'disgusting', 'character', 'traits', 'was', 'so', 'well', 'done', 'viewer', 'away', 'thinking', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'different', 'same', 'circumstances', 'probably', 'not', 'thats', 'beauty', 'film']",N/A
838428,A32XW50ILWOXNO,B0002JZT5A,Samuel McKewon,"[3, 4]","The lead character in ""Young Adam"" is a guy named Joe, and though the movie is set in 1950s Scotland, we all know a version of him: Joe's the guy who can't seem to get out of other women's beds.Wounded, self-hating, Joe is smarter than his working class trappings but unable to rise above it - he aspires to be a writer but is shown throwing his typewriter into the ocean. His primary gift seems to be his allure to women: Two basically throw themselves at Joe, while two others are more than willing to be convinced. One banishes her husband for Joe's bedroom talents, while another dies because of it. In between these women Joe is ambivalent; it all feels pretty good at a crude level but it's also a tremendous hassle when these women begin to expect more.Ewan McGregor plays Joe in a daparture from his usual, good-natured performances. Joe works on a coal barge with a couple, Ella and Les, (Tilda Swinton and Peter Cillian) when, one morning, he finds a dead woman in the water. Joe seems to know her, and Ella seems to know that Joe knows. ""Young Adam"" being the kind of movie where a great deal of work goes on without much being said, Joe and Ella blot out this development with a lot of sex in several different positions.Writer/director David MacKenzie intercuts their affair with a earlier relationship in Joe's life with Cathie (Emily Mortimer) a demure, clever girl he meets on a beach, and long, lovely shots of the barge passing through canals of verdant Scotland. Joe and Ella's sex is desparate and lustful and not a bit discreet; it's inevitable that Les will bring this triangle to an end, though the results are not what you'd expect.And then there is a suspect in the woman's death. Joe becomes interested in the trial. He is certain, and so are we, the defendant is innocent. And yet - Joe is not quite willing to present the truth. As intensely as he follows it, the possibility of an innocent man's death is not enough for him to act. Why? What broke in Joe that can't be fixed?This variation on ""Crime and Punishment"" would be more effective if, frankly, the movie didn't take a sex break every ten minutes. What are their purpose, exactly? They're aren't erotic. Or emotionally charged. The central murder plot is not served by them. One is so bizarre, involving ketchup and other condiments, that it makes the butter scene from ""Last Tango In Paris"" look quaint. McGregor and Swinton, whom one would call brave if she hadn't already played a man in ""Orlando"" all those years ago, mostly project an angry desire to break up the dullness of barge work. ""Young Adam"" has the intercourse and post-coital brooding down pat. What's missing is the point.Besides, other women in the film seem to betray the mores of the 1950s. After all how many housewives stand stark naked in the living room tub in front of an open window? I dunno.

The movie opens on his finding, and fishing out, the semi-nude corpse of a pretty girl from the black and frightening Clyde River (at the bottom of which we see the typewriter he dumped a while before).  Taylor claims to know nothing about this corpse, but by the time the movie, directed by David Mackenzie, and its numerous flashbacks are done, we'll know that he actually knew her quite well: in fact, she was pregnant by him.You wouldn't expect life on a coal barge to be clean, nor is it, and the makeup artists have done quite a job with the ordinarily handsome McEwan.  He's pasty, as befits a resident Scot, drinking and smoking heavily, eating that unhealthy Scots diet, never seeing the sun. And there's ground-in coal dust on his face and in his clothes.  The striking Tilda Swinton costars as Ella Gault, married to Les: they operate the barge together though we later discover she owns it.  Poor Tilda, dead pale, hair lank and filthy, limited, dirty wardrobe: monosyllabic dialogue: in a career of choosing unexpected parts, this might be the least glamorous role she's ever played. In fact, I guess you'd have to describe this movie as fitting right into the recent Scottish school of tartan noir: tougher, blacker and bloodier than usual, although, praises be, occasionally lightened by that dark Scottish humor.Anyway, for a married father,and a major male movie star, McGregor is also known for his daring choice of parts, indie and mainstream.  He's played gay, and gay love scenes, and doesn't shrink from full frontal nudity.  We've got some of that in ""Young Adam,""as well, in the frequent, rather graphic sex scenes. His character Joe Taylor seems to fancy every woman he sees, and they all seem to fancy him right back. Mc Gregor is Scots, born in Crieff, educated at Kirkcaddy College, first came to notice in Danny Boyle's 1994 black comedy ""Shallow Grave,"" and to stardom in Boyle's even blacker 1996 comedy ""Trainspotting.""  Mc Gregor has starred in ""Guys and Dolls"" on the London stage, made ""Moulin Rouge"" and ""Down With Love"" in Hollywood, and ""Little Voice"" in England.Swinton, best known for ""The White Witch"" in ""The Chronicles of Narnia,""singes  the screen with McGregor in their sex scenes, and for a woman with hardly any dialogue, she manages to express quite a lot.  She was born in London of an Australian mother and a Scottish father, who was a Major General in the Scots Guard.  It's said that the Swintons are the oldest family in Scotland and England: the male line has proven descent back to Saxon times.  She currently lives in Nairn, Scotland.The movie doesn't ever get off its Glasgow to Edinburgh axis, and not a whole lot happens. To be sure, Taylor gets quite a bit of female attention, and proves to be not a particularly likeable man. Ella demonstrates that she knows her way around a boat.  There are some fairly taut courtroom scenes. But if you're a movie-movie person,  the mise en scene is great, and the acting is at the highest level.",4,More Black Scottish Humor,1160092800,"10 6, 2006",2006,3160,"['Ewan', 'McGregor', 'Joe', 'Taylor', 'Young', 'Adam', 'young', 'Scottish', 'drifter', 'literary', 'pretensions', 'working', 'coal', 'barge', 'Glasgow', 'Edinburgh', 'movie', 'finding', 'fishing', 'out', 'semi-nude', 'corpse', 'pretty', 'girl', 'black', 'frightening', 'Clyde', 'River', 'bottom', 'see', 'typewriter', 'dumped', 'while', 'Taylor', 'know', 'nothing', 'corpse', 'time', 'movie', 'directed', 'David', 'Mackenzie', 'numerous', 'flashbacks', 'are', 'done', ""'ll"", 'know', 'actually', 'knew', 'quite', 'well', 'fact', 'was', 'pregnant', 'him.You', 'would', ""n't"", 'expect', 'life', 'coal', 'barge', 'be', 'clean', 'makeup', 'artists', 'have', 'done', 'quite', 'job', 'ordinarily', 'handsome', 'McEwan', 'pasty', 'befits', 'resident', 'Scot', 'drinking', 'smoking', 'heavily', 'eating', 'unhealthy', 'Scots', 'diet', 'never', 'seeing', 'sun', 'ground-in', 'coal', 'dust', 'face', 'clothes', 'striking', 'Tilda', 'Swinton', 'Ella', 'Gault', 'married', 'Les', 'operate', 'barge', 'together', 'later', 'discover', 'Poor', 'Tilda', 'dead', 'pale', 'hair', 'lank', 'filthy', 'limited', 'dirty', 'wardrobe', 'monosyllabic', 'dialogue', 'career', 'choosing', 'unexpected', 'parts', 'might', 'be', 'least', 'glamorous', 'role', 'ever', 'played', 'fact', 'guess', ""'d"", 'have', 'describe', 'movie', 'fitting', 'right', 'recent', 'Scottish', 'school', 'tartan', 'noir', 'tougher', 'blacker', 'bloodier', 'usual', 'praises', 'be', 'occasionally', 'lightened', 'dark', 'Scottish', 'humor.Anyway', 'married', 'father', 'major', 'male', 'movie', 'star', 'McGregor', 'also', 'known', 'daring', 'choice', 'parts', 'indie', 'mainstream', 'played', 'gay', 'gay', 'love', 'scenes', ""n't"", 'shrink', 'full', 'frontal', 'nudity', ""'ve"", 'got', 'Young', 'Adam', 'as', 'well', 'frequent', 'rather', 'graphic', 'sex', 'scenes', 'character', 'Joe', 'Taylor', 'fancy', 'woman', 'seem', 'fancy', 'right', 'back', 'Mc', 'Gregor', 'Scots', 'born', 'Crieff', 'educated', 'Kirkcaddy', 'College', 'first', 'came', 'notice', 'Danny', 'Boyle', '1994', 'black', 'comedy', 'Shallow', 'Grave', 'stardom', 'Boyle', 'even', 'blacker', '1996', 'comedy', 'Trainspotting', 'Mc', 'Gregor', 'starred', 'Guys', 'Dolls', 'London', 'stage', 'made', 'Moulin', 'Rouge', 'Down', 'Love', 'Hollywood', 'Little', 'Voice', 'England.Swinton', 'best', 'known', 'White', 'Witch', 'Chronicles', 'Narnia', 'screen', 'McGregor', 'sex', 'scenes', 'woman', 'hardly', 'dialogue', 'express', 'quite', 'lot', 'was', 'born', 'London', 'Australian', 'mother', 'Scottish', 'father', 'who', 'was', 'Major', 'General', 'Scots', 'Guard', 'said', 'Swintons', 'are', 'oldest', 'family', 'Scotland', 'England', 'male', 'line', 'proven', 'descent', 'back', 'Saxon', 'times', 'currently', 'Nairn', 'Scotland.The', 'movie', ""n't"", 'ever', 'get', 'off', 'Glasgow', 'Edinburgh', 'axis', 'not', 'whole', 'lot', 'happens', 'be', 'sure', 'Taylor', 'quite', 'bit', 'female', 'attention', 'be', 'not', 'particularly', 'likeable', 'man', 'Ella', 'way', 'boat', 'are', 'fairly', 'taut', 'courtroom', 'scenes', ""'re"", 'movie-movie', 'person', 'mise', 'en', 'scene', 'great', 'acting', 'highest', 'level']",N/A
838430,A1RRC3ESHQW0YQ,B0002JZT5A,Stuart Gibson,"[8, 10]","This movie makes you realize how wasted Ewan McGregor is in the Star Wars movies.  This guy can act!  And anyone who watched ""The Deep End"" or ""Adaptation"" already knows what an amazing actress Tilda Swinton is.  Her performance in ""Young Adam"" is her best yet.....truly powerful in it's understatement.  She makes being a frumpy Scottish working class mother seem pretty darn sexy!  I had not seen Emily Mortimer before, and I was very impressed with her as well.There is a lot of sex in Young Adam.  I suppose my only gripe about the film is that most of the sex is rather manic.  Why is movie sex always so frantic and noisy?  I suppose directors don't think audiences want to see real sex.  Or they don't think it will make a good movie.Anyway, I'm not complaining too much.  The sex scenes in Young Adam are still a lot better than we get in American films.  There is one particularly fun scene that will remind you of ""9 1/2 weeks"".But really, this film is a powerful meditation on the nature of love and rejection.......life-changing decisions and regret..............the things we make happen versus the things that just happen to us.The cinematography is fantastic.  David Byrne did the score and I didn't even notice it, which is the way it should be.This one's a keeper.",4,Almost gave it 5 stars.

838433,ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T,B0002JZT5A,Tsuyoshi,"[2, 3]","Based on the book 'Young Adam' by the Scotland's beat generation writer Alexander Trocchi, 'Young Adam' features Ewan McGregor, Tilda Swinton, Peter Mullan, and Emily Mortimer.  The impressive photography is provided by Giles Nuttgens ('The Beach') and the music by David Byrne.Let me warn you first: The world of 'Young Adam' is very depressing.  The film is about the characters living in Glasgow, Scotland, in the 50s.  Joe (McGregor) is working as a handyman on the barge with middle-aged husband and wife, Les (Mullan) and Ella (Swinton), carrying coal on the canal.  The life is monotonous, until they find a dead body of a girl on the river.It does not take much time for us to discover that Joe and Ella will be having an affair on the boat.  Actually, the film has little to say about what will happen in the 90 minutes except these characters, and one murder trial, of which verdict can be known by anyone from the beginning.  And in the occasional flashback scenes, we are shown the life of Joe as an aspiring writer, living with a girl named Cathy (Mortimer).[CHARACTER STUDY] The merit of 'Young Adam' is the descriptions of the characters, supported by unanimously good acting.  Joe is a kind of man who is on the run from his past, and reaching for something that he knows he cannot get (like, going to China while he would not leave the city).  Ella and Les are bored with the boat, bored with each other, and bored with the life itself.  None of them are particularly likeable persons.  The photography is beautiful, which makes the life of the people more dismal and hopeless.  Even nudites (especially Tilda Swinton's) often make the whole scene repugnant.However, the film itself is memorable, with its strong acting from the lead Ewan McGregor, who gives his best performance since 'Transpotting.'  But even his avid fans might find the contents too dismal and relentless.  Now, the film's life on the boat is the perfect antipodes of romantic drama, like the Jean Vigo classic.",4,"(3.5 STARS) ""Going Nowhere....""
