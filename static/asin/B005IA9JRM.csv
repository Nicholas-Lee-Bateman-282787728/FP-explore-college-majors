So we have slowly been collecting the seasons.  I checked around and I think the 2 season combo is the way to go.  I paid $19.99 and it qualified for free super saver shipping.  That is only $10.00 a season for a brand new copy.  It seemed the individual seasons cost about $15 new.  Used copys can be a little bit cheaper, but then you never really know what the condition will be.It is a funny show too.  If you haven't watched it before and you are looking for a chuckle, I would check it out.",5,"Purchased as a gift, great deal",1369699200,"05 28, 2013",2013,607,"['bought', 'girlfriend', 'watched', 'Friends', 'TV', 'originally', 'wanted', 'watch', 'again', 'order', 'have', 'slowly', 'been', 'collecting', 'seasons', 'checked', 'think', '2', 'season', 'combo', 'way', 'go', 'paid', '19.99', 'qualified', 'free', 'super', 'saver', 'shipping', 'only', '10.00', 'season', 'brand', 'new', 'copy', 'seemed', 'individual', 'seasons', 'cost', '15', 'new', 'Used', 'copys', 'can', 'be', 'little', 'bit', 'cheaper', 'then', 'never', 'really', 'know', 'what', 'condition', 'will', 'be.It', 'funny', 'show', 'too', 'have', ""n't"", 'watched', 'are', 'looking', 'chuckle', 'would', 'check', 'out']",Friends: The Complete Fifth and Sixth Seasons
