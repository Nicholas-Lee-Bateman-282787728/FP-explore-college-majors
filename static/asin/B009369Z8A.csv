Instead, I was very much surprised by the clever acting of Shia Labeouf, Guy Pearce, and Gary Oldman. The studio got it right by underselling the audience with their dull theatrical previews, which leave out the qualities of 'Lawless' that grant it a Tarantinoesque appeal. There are key parts within this movie that make the viewer recoil in disgust, something that is very difficult to pull off outside of slasher movies. Tom Hardy's portrayal of Forrest Bondurant is a bit uneven, as he overacts his role in a puerile sort of way. On the contrary, Guy Pearce's squealy filthiness as Charlie Rakes gives us one of the greatest screen villains since the 'Scorpio Killer' inDirty Harry [Blu-ray].

Sooooo Baaaad (*insert mile-long groan here)  I honestly can think of NO reason for my worst enemy to suffer this blight on cinema.  Gary Oldman is cool and all but he's in it so briefly that he becomes another symptom the empty promise that is LAWLESS.  It's movie seriously ridiculous.  Friends have called me from all corners of this great nation to confirm this theory.  Eeee gads!  LAWLESS is a horror show of stinky acting, painful premise and nausiating filmmaking - if you can call it that.  In fact, lets start with with the direction of this travesty.The director - I have no interest in learning his name after LAWLESS - must have really thought of himself as a serious filmmaker because of the ""symbolic"" shots of roosters in the yard after the jacked-up macho brothers fight, or the shot of the horses running in the fields when the two lovers drive off on their date together...NEED I SAY MORE?Now lets talk acting.(I say what I say with love - because there are a lot of brilliant actors in this movie. They were just given a lame script and a fourteen year old director who apparently thought his mind was expanding.  I pity that situation - however endorsed by Hollywood it may be.  The victims are the actors every time.)Yet Tom Hardy might be a little culpable.Tom Hardy... What movie were you in?? You were off on your own planet!  Did you read in the script that your character was the hard-as-nails older brother and thought that you'd been given permission to be as superior and distant as you wanted? Seriously, man. Your grumbling voice was so much more believable when you had a mask covering your face in Batman.  There was no connection to your fellow actors which may have been an ""artistic choice"" but you need to at least know what the other actors are doing so you can look like you belong in the same movie!!  Eee gads!I don't even have the heart to continue with this review. For one reason, I saw it last spring and I've tried to shut it out completely.  Suffice to say it was hands down THE WORST FILM I HAVE SEEN IN THE THEATER IN A LONG TIME.  As for the plot: If you want to see a bunch of ignorant hillbilly bootleggers pretending to be gangsters but whose story goes NOWHERE by all means, fire away.

1584539,A14Z0Q1DU6CBJJ,B009369Z8A,Chris Kennison,"[2, 4]","Oscar season has officially begun with the arrival of ""Lawless"", the best movie of the year so far. The movie is based upon a 2008 novel ""The Wettest County in the World"", written by Matt Bondurant, who is the grandson and grand nephew of the characters depicted in the film. The film, set in prohibition-era Franklin County, Virginia, is an authentic and truthful depiction of life as they knew it in bootleg heavy, depression-era Virginia.The story centers around the Bondurant brothers, Forrest (Tom Hardy), Howard (Jason Clarke) and Jack (Shia Lebeouf), Jack being the younger and more timid of the three. In fact, Forrest and Howard, can not at all be described as anything close to timid.Prohibition is in place, yet moonshine is run back and forth from county line to county line without any trouble. There's an unwritten acceptance of a business that hasn't really caused any trouble. Yet, things are beginning to brew in Chicago with many now well known gangsters thriving, the government is cracking down. It is just a matter of time before that crack down reaches them in the hills of Virginia. So, unless the Bondurant's want trouble, they have to begin to pay the government for the pleasure of continuing to do business. That doesn't sit well with Forrest and Howard.The movie, written by Nick Cave and directed by John Hillcoat is an absolute stunner. Not necessarily for the images depicted on screen, but for the quality of the film, given that Nick Cave has only written three screenplays since 1988. Twenty-four years and only two prior scripts and Nick Cave may just be one of the biggest hidden secrets in Hollywood. Known mostly for his music, but Cave has delivered a tight, can't take my eyes off the screen, Oscar night guarantee.The authenticity of the film and the beauty of the cinematography is what film making is all about. The creators took us back in time nearly a century and never once do you question its validity and never once do you want to miss a single scene. The humor is perfect and the violence is harsh and realistic. You feel the tenseness and the unpredictable nature of what the film could possibly do at any given moment.I'm surprised that it's already September and I've yet to see a film that made me mention the word Oscar.

He was one of those villains you love to hate and wait for his demise. And Jessica Chastain vava voom. Good job honey as usual.

1584543,A30N4CJVI6U4XE,B009369Z8A,"Chris Wilson ""Chris Kent""","[0, 0]","The opening scenes of ""Lawless,"" John Hillcoat's fascinating 2012 work, are so intense they create anticipation the film does not live up to. Tom Hardy plays brother Forrest Bondurant, the formidable protector of a backwoods Virginia moonshine operation during the Prohibition. He has a face-off with a new sheriff of sorts, the preening Charlie Rakes (Guy Pearce) who has arrived by way of Chicago to collect toll. Hardy's stare is so intense it practically cracks the camera lens. After barely a pronounced word and the twitch of a brow, you know instantly his savage code is not to be underestimated. It's a spellbinding moment the film rarely matches.There's a great movie here, a sort of combination ofMiller's Crossing [HD] andWinter's Bone, but somewhere on the muddy back roads it becomes lost in box office ambition. Based on the true story of the Bondurants, with a screenplay adapted by Nick Cave from Matt Bondurant's memoirThe Wettest County in the World: A Novel Based on a True Story, filmmakers cast Shia LaBeouf as the youngest brother -- the runt of the litter -- and primarily focus on his attempts to live the code while courting the preacher's daughter. Such plot developments are as old as James Cagney's socks.LaBeouf is an acquired taste anyway, possessing boyish looks without the slightest menace. Hardy's presence, not to mention Jason Clarke as the fearless older brother Howard, completely swallow LaBeouf's sniveling portrayal. There's a primitive society here (check out the classic documentaryHarlan County, U.S.A. (The Criterion Collection)), and Hardy and Clarke capture the palpable nature of such blood cults. You need fingernail dirt, and LaBeouf has the presence of a kid folding jeans at The Gap.By way of Australia, Hillcoat has sparked an interesting career withThe PropositionandThe Road. ""Lawless"" is a step back, though shows signs of considerable post-production tinkering. One suspects the film clocked at three-plus hours and Hillcoat had to whittle down to two. There's a musical montage that shows the Bondurants rolling in moonshine money while Pearce's Rakes destroys neighboring stills dotting the Virginia mountains. It's the moment the film unravels.""Lawless"" introduces two fascinating characters, including Maggie Beauford, a dame with a past (Jessica Chastain), and gangster Floyd Banner (Gary Oldman), but both are practically forgotten. Chastain especially deserves screen time, working the bar at the Bondurants' rural enterprise and capturing the wary eye of Forrest. There's an unforgettable scene when Chastain, sans clothes, slowly pats down a darkened hallway to his bed, ranking as one of the most haunting snapshots in recent memory. It's the type of image Jean Cocteau would admire (Beauty and The Beast (The Criterion Collection)).Such moments in ""Lawless"" abound. It's a beautiful film, with the extraordinary cinematography of Benoit Delhomme, on-location filming in rural Georgia and brooding set designs creating a lamentable atmosphere. But the plot flow is too fragmented. You know there's going to be a showdown between Forrest and Sheriff Rakes, and they indeed meet next to a covered bridge surrounded by men toting rusty shotguns. By this point, the film has entirely lost its momentum, and it stumbles to an abrupt ending lacking the poetry Hillcoat was hoping for.Prior to ""Lawless,"" I had only seen Hardy in a few blockbuster epics (Inception). His performance is a revelation, possessing the presence of mountains. It's a bitter sin we are forced to endure LaBeouf's preening. There's an interesting supporting character, a local handicapped youth named Cricket. Played by relative unknown Dane DeHaan, it's a striking portrait of tragedy. Wouldn't it have been interesting to switch DeHaan and LaBeouf? I'm just not convinced LaBeouf can evolve into the kind of leading man of action ""Lawless"" attempts to force-feed us. And when you have Hardy, Clarke, Chastain and Oldman standing in the background with the film's running time slowly ticking away, you know a great opportunity has been lost.",3,You need fingernail dirt...,1366934400,"04 26, 2013",2013,4078,"['opening', 'scenes', 'Lawless', 'John', 'Hillcoat', 'fascinating', '2012', 'work', 'are', 'so', 'intense', 'create', 'anticipation', 'film', 'not', 'live', 'up', 'Tom', 'Hardy', 'brother', 'Forrest', 'Bondurant', 'formidable', 'protector', 'backwoods', 'Virginia', 'moonshine', 'operation', 'Prohibition', 'face-off', 'new', 'sheriff', 'sorts', 'preening', 'Charlie', 'Rakes', 'Guy', 'Pearce', 'who', 'arrived', 'way', 'Chicago', 'collect', 'toll', 'Hardy', 'stare', 'so', 'intense', 'practically', 'camera', 'barely', 'pronounced', 'word', 'twitch', 'brow', 'know', 'instantly', 'savage', 'code', 'not', 'be', 'underestimated', 'spellbinding', 'moment', 'film', 'rarely', 'great', 'movie', 'here', 'sort', 'combination', 'ofMiller', 'Crossing', '[', 'HD', ']', 'andWinter', 'Bone', 'somewhere', 'muddy', 'back', 'lost', 'box', 'office', 'ambition', 'Based', 'true', 'story', 'Bondurants', 'screenplay', 'adapted', 'Nick', 'Cave', 'Matt', 'Bondurant', 'memoirThe', 'Wettest', 'County', 'World', 'Novel', 'Based', 'True', 'Story', 'filmmakers', 'cast', 'Shia', 'LaBeouf', 'youngest', 'brother', 'runt', 'litter', 'primarily', 'focus', 'attempts', 'live', 'code', 'courting', 'preacher', 'daughter', 'Such', 'plot', 'developments', 'are', 'as', 'old', 'James', 'Cagney', 'socks.LaBeouf', 'acquired', 'taste', 'anyway', 'possessing', 'boyish', 'looks', 'slightest', 'menace', 'Hardy', 'presence', 'not', 'mention', 'Jason', 'Clarke', 'fearless', 'older', 'brother', 'Howard', 'completely', 'swallow', 'LaBeouf', 'sniveling', 'portrayal', 'primitive', 'society', 'here', 'check', 'out', 'classic', 'documentaryHarlan', 'County', 'U.S.A.', 'Criterion', 'Collection', 'Hardy', 'Clarke', 'capture', 'palpable', 'nature', 'such', 'blood', 'cults', 'need', 'fingernail', 'dirt', 'LaBeouf', 'presence', 'kid', 'folding', 'jeans', 'Gap.By', 'way', 'Australia', 'Hillcoat', 'sparked', 'interesting', 'career', 'PropositionandThe', 'Road', 'Lawless', 'step', 'back', 'shows', 'signs', 'considerable', 'post-production', 'tinkering', 'One', 'film', 'clocked', 'three-plus', 'hours', 'Hillcoat', 'had', 'whittle', 'down', 'two', 'musical', 'montage', 'Bondurants', 'rolling', 'moonshine', 'money', 'Pearce', 'Rakes', 'neighboring', 'stills', 'dotting', 'Virginia', 'mountains', 'moment', 'film', 'unravels', 'Lawless', 'two', 'fascinating', 'characters', 'including', 'Maggie', 'Beauford', 'dame', 'past', 'Jessica', 'Chastain', 'gangster', 'Floyd', 'Banner', 'Gary', 'Oldman', 'are', 'practically', 'forgotten', 'Chastain', 'especially', 'screen', 'time', 'working', 'bar', 'Bondurants', 'rural', 'enterprise', 'capturing', 'wary', 'eye', 'Forrest', 'unforgettable', 'scene', 'when', 'Chastain', 'clothes', 'slowly', 'down', 'darkened', 'hallway', 'bed', 'ranking', 'one', 'most', 'haunting', 'snapshots', 'recent', 'memory', 'type', 'image', 'Jean', 'Cocteau', 'would', 'admire', 'Beauty', 'Beast', 'Criterion', 'Collection', '.Such', 'moments', 'Lawless', 'abound', 'beautiful', 'film', 'extraordinary', 'cinematography', 'Benoit', 'Delhomme', 'on-location', 'filming', 'rural', 'Georgia', 'brooding', 'set', 'designs', 'creating', 'lamentable', 'atmosphere', 'plot', 'flow', 'too', 'fragmented', 'know', 'going', 'be', 'showdown', 'Forrest', 'Sheriff', 'Rakes', 'indeed', 'meet', 'next', 'covered', 'bridge', 'surrounded', 'men', 'toting', 'rusty', 'shotguns', 'point', 'film', 'entirely', 'lost', 'momentum', 'abrupt', 'ending', 'lacking', 'poetry', 'Hillcoat', 'was', 'hoping', 'for.Prior', 'Lawless', 'had', 'only', 'seen', 'Hardy', 'few', 'blockbuster', 'epics', 'Inception', 'performance', 'revelation', 'possessing', 'presence', 'mountains', 'bitter', 'sin', 'are', 'forced', 'endure', 'LaBeouf', 'preening', 'interesting', 'supporting', 'character', 'local', 'handicapped', 'youth', 'named', 'Cricket', 'Played', 'relative', 'unknown', 'Dane', 'DeHaan', 'striking', 'portrait', 'tragedy', 'Would', ""n't"", 'have', 'been', 'interesting', 'switch', 'DeHaan', 'LaBeouf', ""'m"", 'just', 'not', 'convinced', 'LaBeouf', 'can', 'evolve', 'kind', 'leading', 'man', 'action', 'Lawless', 'attempts', 'force-feed', 'when', 'have', 'Hardy', 'Clarke', 'Chastain', 'Oldman', 'standing', 'background', 'film', 'running', 'time', 'slowly', 'ticking', 'away', 'know', 'great', 'opportunity', 'been', 'lost']",N/A
1584544,A1RXVSBGGRKIIW,B009369Z8A,"Comparison Shopping  Consumer ""Don't Shop! Ad...","[0, 0]","There are a lot of reviews here for this movie, so there is not much more that I can add, that has not already been said.But I really enjoyed this movie, so I have to at least throw in my 2 cents or more :-)(Side Note:The movie is based on a real family of  moon-shining  brothers, and a real incident that ends up in the papers. I believe there is a book out right now, about the real brothers behind the movie LAWLESS, written by the grandson of one of the brothers shown in this movie. I don't want to give away which brother that is.)I love period film pieces. And the era of the 20's and 30's has always appealed to me as well. So right off the bat, I knew from seeing the trailer, I was bound to rent this  movie sooner or later.Funny how the period piece films bring a nostalgia to them, that you actually feel, even if you were not even born at the time the movie/story is taking place.This was well done as far as giving the viewer the feel for what the Prohibition Days were like down south and how MOONSHINE production was taken very seriously- not just for personal consumption, but for re-sale to others.Whether it was made and sold to locals or a bigger concern- like gangsters, who would often then re-sell it as well;for the time booze was illegal, moonshine was a big money maker for those creating it.In reality, and upon looking back at the proliferation of booze that still flowed across America despite the ban - Prohibition not only did not stop the use of alcohol- it drove up the demand.That was the lesson learned about trying to ban alcohol.You have to wonder, for the amount of years booze was illegal, how many people were getting rich off the illegality- as well as how many people got sick or died off bad moonshine.(Going blind or dropping dead were the risk you took, if you bought moonshine  made by someone who didn't know what they were doing.)But as always, when there is a demand for something- especially something hard to get and illicit- there is big money to be had.The three tightly knit brothers in LAWLESS jumped on this money making bandwagon early in the game, although the two older brothers try to keep the youngest( Shia Lebouf) from being *too* involved in the business, which he greatly resents.They definitely love him- and there is a deep thread of loyalty that hold all three together, but the two older brothers don't seem to think their little brother has what it takes to play by the rules in this game.They make it clear this is not a game one can screw up in.Mistakes get people shot and often killed. Mistakes can piss off people and stir up trouble.So, while the money they earn is shared amongst all of them,( they also run a restaurant as well) Shia Lebouf's youth and immaturity cause the brothers to shut him out of things; for his own sake and for the sake of their thriving business.In the very rural area  where the brothers reside, it is unspoken code that law enforcement looks the other way for local moonshiners - out of courtesy or for a little kickback.Nobody hassles anyone really. It is a peaceful, predictable life and the townsfolk all seem to get along.That is,until Guy Pearce's character comes to town.Pearce has slime ball written all over him.A sadistic, city slicker, quirky in a sick & twisted way, he announces himself a federal arm of the law who will hunt down every moonshiner until there are none left.He has heard about the moonshine business being very lucrative in this area, but more importantly he has heard about the three brothers, in particularly the one brother who is deemed *immortal*( played by a scruffily handsome Tom Hardy).This is the local lore and it more or less develops that Hardy is immortal because of the many trials and tribulations he has endured in his young life, particularly when it comes to fighting, particularly with guns.Guy Pearce is both intrigued and amused by the lore of this brother who can't be killed.It should be noted that it is Tom Hardy's character who basically plays the head of the family to the other 2 brothers.  ( Their parents died earlier but that is not depicted in the film.)He is looked up to by his brothers with great awe, respect and admiration.Also,it is always his word that is final in any matters regarding the family- particularly the business end of things.Guy Pearce  finally gets the chance to meet Hardy and the exchange is an unpleasant one.One which Hardy makes it clear, that Pearce's presence and  position of law enforcement, don't mean squat to him.Verbally, he gives Pearce the proverbial slap in the face, and in front of others, no less.Pearce walks away thinking it is time to take Tom Hardy and his almighty reputation down a notch.Developing an instant hatred for the man, Pearce is all too eager to be the man to see  the *immortal one* go down in flames.He becomes hellbent on destroying  not just  Tom Hardy 's character, but also, his moon-shining brothers and their business.Kudos for Guy Pearce, for playing one of the creepiest, skin crawling characters to ever show up in story line,with such subtly.Accolades for Tom Hardy, playing the strong silent type, that tends to delivers cryptic words of wisdom.The guy who has been to hell and back and is still standing.This is a character, who never actually looks for a fight, but also never backs down from one.He always comports himself with confidence, not arrogance.Sometimes  he has a  certain look or gives off an affect at times, that says that under all that tough veneer, that ability to always seem steel strong, that there might be a layer of emotional vulnerability buried deep inside, underneath it all.Jessica Chastain is there as a  meaningful character but how meaningful is not realized right away.While her part is important, she doesn't get to do all that much talking.Regardless, it becomes obvious she is an integral part of the storyline as it moves along.Gary Oldman is a personification, a collage if you will,of any and all gangsters of that era, whose names were on the headlines of newspapers, or heard about on the radio, back in the day.His film time is brief- too brief really. (Especially if you are an Oldman fan.)Though his screen time is short, it is Oldman's  character's unusual meeting and  interaction with Shia Lebouf , that leaves an impact on Lebouf's character and gives him the guts and incentive to show his brothers he is definitely ready to join their ranks.He feels he can finally prove to them, he has what it it takes to finally work hands on, in the business, especially doing physical transactions of transporting moon-shine.Is this film violent?  Yes, it is, and the violence is up close and gritty, but it is not gratuitous violence in my opinion.It is there to show how ruthless things start to get, in this once sleepy little town, once Guy Pearce sticks his nose into things.And trust me- moonshine might be illegal but you will hate Guy Pearce so much, it will just give you all the more reason to root for not just the 3 brothers, but anybody trying to get by, selling their home made moonshine.The whole movie takes on a new tone and a different pace, once Guy Pearce's character comes to town to make trouble, and a name for himself.If you can handle violence and want to see how life in the South was during the prohibition( as opposed to often seeing it  depicted in the big cities)this is a fast paced movie, with a definite amount of suspense, where all the key characters play their parts well and an ending that should satisfy all.I know that after  seeing this movie, I later went online to look up more about this trio, as well as reviewing articles on the Prohibition era in general.It might certainly look a lot more glamorous and macho in the movies  of Hollywood,as depicted in the past and present, but there is no doubt that the Prohibition days were colorful, interesting and, often daringly dangerous times indeed.",5,"An intriguing, if violent, look back in history.Great period

They practically own Franklin County, the residents of whom respect--and fear--Forrest Bondurant, the brothers' ringleader.  But a new lawman, Special Deputy Charlie Rakes, is determined to take his piece of the pie.  But, as Forrest succinctly puts it, the Bondurants ""don't lay down for nobody.""The film hinges around youngest brother Jack, played here with surprisingly poise by Shia Lebeouf.  It's basically his story, though, as with Matt Bondurant's source novel THE WETTEST COUNTY IN THE WORLD, the most intriguing character is Forrest.  As portrayed by Tom Hardy, Forrest is a hulking beast of few words, a man tied by honor and loyalty, caught up in his own legend, mostly because it largely happens to be true.  Hardy brings much of the same physicality to Forrest as he did to Bane in THE DARK KNIGHT RISES, creating yet another memorable performance in a career full of them.  As the third brother, Howard, Jason Clarke doesn't have much to do, but does it extremely well; one wishes his role were larger.  As the villain Rakes (a composite of characters from the novel), Guy Pearce is electric; he walks and talks like a big city dandy, but he strikes with the suddenness and venom of a cobra.  Mia Wasikowski doesn't have much to do in her role of a preacher's daughter; as in the novel, her burgeoning relationship with Jack takes a backseat to everything else.  More interesting is the relationship between Forrest and Maggie, portrayed with an air of regality and seduction by Jessica Chastain.  Perhaps most enjoyable of all, if only for its brevity, is Gary Oldman's performance as a gangster whom Jack admires: in his two scenes, Oldman reminds us why he's one of the great villain actors of his generation (in fact, he does this with a single wink).The script comes from frequent John Hillicoat collaborator Nick Cave, who again (along with Warren Ellis) provides an exquisitely haunting score.  The trio of Hillicoat, Cave, and Ellis gave us the superb THE PROPOSITION (Pearce's contributions cannot be ignored, either); if LAWLESS doesn't quite equal THE PROPOSITION's level of violence, it's not for lack of trying.  This is a violent film.  The violence isn't constant, but it's realistic and powerful, as it should be in this sort of film.  The story is, of course, somewhat true; if Bondurant's book is a fictionalization of his family's history, then Hillicoat's film is a fictionalization of the book.  Cave's script, Hillicoat's direction, and the actors' performances hold fast to this element of truth: this film, at its core, isn't about moonshine, but humanity.  And sometimes, humanity can be an ugly, violent thing.",5,"""It's not violence that sets men apart.

Shia LaBeouf gives his best performance, perhaps of his career, as Jack, the youngest of the Bondurant brothers, who took part in the American dream as back-woods moonshiners. You'll find traces of LaBeouf's typical charm here, but he brings an intensity to the screen I haven't seen from him before. Another fantastic performance is given my Tom Hardy, who plays Jack's older and burlier brother Forrest, who will go to any lengths to uphold his principles. Guy Pearce plays Charley Rakes, the menacing deputy that is trying to put a stop to the Bondurant brother's business, and a character you will instantly hate.The cinematography in the movie is absolutely gorgeous. John Hillcoat does a terrific job using the Virginian landscape to his advantage, as well as using lighting and colors to their full advantage. I found myself in awe of some of the scenes.An issue I had with the film is that there were a couple of storylines that could have been developed further, particularly Gary Oldman's and Jessica Chastain's. They both give good performances but I would have liked to see some more screen time from both of them.Other than that, the movie flows fairly well and comes to a satisfying close.

""Lawless"" is cut from the same mold except the setting is Prohibition era Franklin County, Virginia.  Bootleg whiskey for generations was the county's primary industry and there was a gentleman's agreement between the manufacturers of moonshine and law enforcement that kept the business thriving.  Where there is a buck to be made, however, there are outsiders who want a piece of the action and they come in the form of a Chicago gangster(Gary Oldman) and a sadistic U.S. attorney(Guy Pearce).  The film focuses on the Bondurant family whose motto is ""We control fear.  Fear doesn't control us"".  The oldest brother Forrest (Tom Hardy) is bloodied but unbowed and will protect the family interests at all costs.  As in ""The Proposition"" Hillcoat doesn't shy away from the violence that's a byproduct of these turf wars.  You get a real sense of time and place with exquisite period art direction.

I'm somewhere in the middle on this one, and I'll tell you why.""Lawless"" is a film based on the novel ""The Wettest County in the World.""  It is based on tales of the Bondurant Brothers, three brothers from Virginia who had a moonshine business to run during the time of the Great Depression.  Howard, the oldest, is played by Jason Clarke.  His character is never really pursued; all I knew is that he was one of the brothers.  Tom Hardy plays the legendary Forrest.  Forrest Bondurant was viewed by many (himself included) to be indestructible.  He finds out that sometimes it isn't violence that kills you--it's stupidity.  Shia LeBeouf plays Jack, the youngest brother, and here's where I thought the story was severely flawed.  I never knew exactly what his ""story"" was about.  With Forrest and Howard, you knew the whys of what they did.  You also knew they were ruthless men who would just as soon kill you as look at you.  Jack, the youngest brother, had NONE of the traits of his older brothers, yet he seemed hell bent on putting himself in the middle of things--and for what reason I'll never know.  Guy Pearce plays an over-the-top evil federal agent, but I kept asking myself why did the Bondurants let him live so long when anyone else that ever crossed them didn't have it nearly that easy.  And playing that kind of character, one has a tendency to overkill it.  Such was the case in Mr. Pearce's portrayal.  I thought he was just a little too much.Nevertheless, the movie is not that bad.  However, I (again) was put off by the forced romances of both Forrest and Jack.  I just think the movie would have been better had it just dealt with moonshiners, crooked police officers, and ruthless federal agents.  The movie is rated R for language and violence and lasts 116 minutes.

1584584,A1E6JS6C205VZD,B009369Z8A,Dr. Laurence Raw,"[0, 1]","Set during the Prohibition Era in 1931, LAWLESS traces the fortunes of the three Bondicant brothers - Forrest (Tom Hardy), the brains, Howard (Jason Clarke), the heavy, and Jack (Shia LaBoeuf), the weakest of the trio, as they run their bootlegging business in a rural part of Franklin County, West Virginia.  Theirs is a risky business; not only do they have to worry about rival syndicates, notably that led by Floyd Banner (Gary Oldman), but they are continually harassed by an over-zealous deputy Charlie Rakes (Guy Pearce), who is determined to eradicate them at all costs.  John Hillcoat's film explores the tempestuous relationship between the brothers; although perpetually denigrating Jack as the &#34;runt&#34; of the family, the other two always stand up for him, especially when he gets into trouble.  Likewise Jack does his best to maintain the bootlegging business, even if it means making an audacious trip to sell illicit hooch to Flord Banner, accompanied by the disabled Cricket Pate (Dane DeHaan).  The film establishes a convincing sense of period, a time when bootleggers either killed or were killed as they strove to maintain their supremacy in an overcrowded market.  Dismissed as &#34;hicks,&#34; because of their rural origins, the Bondicoats turn out to be formidable adversaries, even though Forrest tends to believe a little too much in his (self-constructed) legend about the family's indestructibility.  The film is extremely violent, containing at least two stomach-churning sequences, but this is necessary to the depiction of a dog-eat-dog world in which everyone is out for themselves.  The only jarring note in an otherwise tautly plotted thriller is Guy Pearce's pantomime villain: with his immaculate suits and perpetually curled lip, he seems to have wandered in from a Victorian melodrama rather than an early Thirties gangster movie.  We feel that his demise at the end is richly deserved, as Jack finally overcomes his squeamishness about shooting enemies and mortally wounds the deputy.

(This isn't to say I don't enjoy it when it's obviously necessary, but I digress ...)  Some actors show great promise when they're young, and, as they age, they're rewarded with material that, sadly, might be beneath them and their skills.  In other instances, the material may be so horribly written that it's hard to accept any measure of theatrical skill could've saved it.  However, in some noticeable cases, an actor is blessed with the reputation of a master thespian despite the fact that no series of performances warrants the praise.  I tend to think Shia LaBeouf falls into this last category - it's not to imply he's untalented but rather to say I've only seen middling performances (at best) from the man - and LAWLESS puts him in yet another picture that possibly may've benefitted from some fresh blood as a leading man instead of an established box office name.

In 1931, when the law started catching up with bootleggers if for no other purpose than to get a piece of their action, it was the Bondurants who held out against the corrupt system, preferring to keep their business (and their earnings) to themselves.  This is no small way helped turn Franklyn into the wettest county in the world (the very name of the book upon which this screenplay was based).  When crooked officers tried to shut them down, the brothers fought back, tooth and nail.As for the rest of the story?Meh.  It's all a bit nebulous as incidents that may've been based on real history play out more like structured character `beats' than they do a comfortable narrative.  Jack is the runt of the litter - he's clearly only half as rough and rugged as his brothers Howard and Forrest (both are rumored to be indestructible if not immortal by locals), and he takes the brunt of it when Charlie Rakes (Guy Pearce in a weird turn of face) comes down hard on the family.  He's beaten and kicked around solidly for much of the film, so it only stands to reason that, come the conclusion, he'd go all `Billy Jack' on the lawman.  While that may be based on a true account of the affair, it ends up feeling mostly manufactured here.Also, it didn't help matters that LaBeouf ended up being shackled with a hackneyed Southern accent.  He does the best he can with the lines, but, having seen him in so many big budget productions, so much of his dialect here sounded really inauthentic in the bad-community-theatre kind of way.  Hardy was able to pull it off mostly because he had so little to say (Clarke similarly only had a handful of scenes of extended dialogue).  Again, it's a middling performance not all that believable based on circumstances, which is why I said in the onset that I don't want to feel as though I'm piling on LaBeouf given the fact that he's appeared in two out of three TRANSFORMERS films that were pretty awful as well as almost single-handedly destroying every good memory I have of an INDIANA JONES motion picture.Again, if my bias is showing, you'll have to forgive me.  Like most of you, I take my fascination with flicks very seriously - serious enough to write about them increasingly online - and I try hard to not be prejudiced with acting talent.  I think LaBeouf's a diamond-in-the-rough probably a few years more in the making; I think he was wrong for this movie; but I don't hate his work.Jessica Chastain makes a nice turn here as Maggie Beauford, a Chicago dancer who self-deported to Virginia for quieter spaces.  Unfortunately, she's relegated to secondary status here.  I would've loved to have seen more of her, but, alas, the story as scripted simply didn't allow for it.Lastly, let me make a plug here for more films of this nature (those based on historical events).  In particular, I've always been fascinated with America's greatest failed social experiment, Prohibition.  I've read plenty of books on the subject - it fascinates me - and LAWLESS does an admirable job showing us today what it was like `back in the day.'  It these elements I wish we were shown more of - a miniseries much like the recent HATFIELDS AND MCCOYS would be stellar, and even the dry (pardon the pun) PBS documentary PROHIBITION (thank you, Ken Burns) comes to mind - I think LAWLESS would've had a chance at finding a bigger audience.LAWLESS is produced by Benaroya Pictures, FilmNation Entertainment, Annapurna Pictures, Blum Hanson Allen Films, Pie Films Inc., Red Wagon Productions, and Yucaipa Films.  DVD distribution appears to have been handled through Anchor Bay.  As for the technical specifications, this is a big Hollywood production; as such, it all looks and sounds pretty solid, except for a few of Hardy's lines which were (I believe) deliberately hard to understand as his character tended to be fairly soft-spoken as well as a man of few words.RECOMMENDED.  Knowing what I know of Prohibition, I'd suspect that there's an awful lot more to this story than what was delivered.  At best, the script services the need to tell a story - it sets up each of these characters with the barest of bones, presents a catalyst for drama, and then delivers said climax with albeit predictable results - but I can't help but wonder what more there is to the story that couldn't fit inside the traditional two-hour package.  LaBeouf continues to get starring roles despite his lack of presence - I'd have spent more time with Hardy's underplayed (and underexplored) Forrest Bondurant and Clarke's Howard Bondurant; his character seemed so circumstantial here, that I'm not sure what more he could've added with his limited and overrated skills, but it is what it is.",3,Serviceable Prohibition Drama Weighed Down By

This film takes you in the total opposite direction.Here's the scoop. Set in depression era Franklin County, Virginia, this story involves the 3 Bondurant brothers who make and run moonshine. A heavy weight deputy from Chicago (Guy Pearce) arrives and is determined to shut them down. Things get out of hand.This is an uber violent film. All manner of grievous bodily harm ensues. Shootings, beatings and throat cuttings make up most of it.The older brothers (Tom Hardy, Jason Clarke) know their business, while the younger brother (Shia LaBouf) wants to prove himself worthy of equal billing. He's also courting the local preacher's daughter. Guy Pearce is particularly sleazy. There have been several violent bad guys in film history that showed shades of homosexuality. Somehow it makes them all the scarier. That's Pearce. He's referred to as a &#34;Nancy boy.&#34; And he goes way out of his way to be as violent as possible.The performances are good. Especially Tom Hardy. I'm no Shia LaBouf fan but he IS getting better. Gary Oldman's role is too small as is Mia Wasikowska's. But Jessica Chastain looks delicious and chews her role up just fine. I like the look of the film. Great attention is paid to period detail. I also liked the music though some of it tried, unsuccessfully, to make things lighter. This is too heavy for that. It's shot really well and the directing is a bit odd. Difficult to explain but it looks as though director Hillcoat always had the camera in some spot that was counter intuitive to where I thought it would be. But I DID like it.This might not be quite worth the 4 stars i gave it but it's well worth anyone's time.

The cast is what attracts people to attend this movie, but as far as a story is concerned it is all harsh and bloody and poorly developed despite how hard the actors try with the script they've been given (Nick Cave adapted Matt Bondurant's novel `The Wettest County in the World').The infamous Bondurant brothers - Forrest (Tom Hardy), Howard (Jason Clarke) and Jack (Shia LaBeouf) - assisted by a rickets crippled boy named Crickett (Dane DeHaan) run a successful bootlegging operation during the depression, up in the mountains of Franklin County, Virginia. The only new person to be admitted into the Bondurant clan is Maggie Beauford (Jessica Chastain) who has escaped Chicago nightclub life for the `peace' of the countryside. Also from Chicago comes crooked Special Deputy Charles Rakes (Guy Pearce) who is after a share of the brothers' profits. Compounding their troubles, the local competition is elbowing in on their activities. Forrest's boisterous defiance and Cricket's knack for moonshine production help the brothers gain a local monopoly. When Forrest is wounded as tension with Rakes escalates, Jack, initially the timid one, must prove his worth against local gangster Floyd Banner's (Gary Oldman) mob, and we see him metamorphose into a cocky exhibitionist in his attempts to woo the off-limits preacher's daughter, Bertha (Mia Wasikowski).The actors make these people memorable, especially Tom Hardy who simply mumbles his way through life unafraid of death or any outside foes. The rest of the cast is strong given the weak script and the overall atmosphere of the Depression era bootlegging business is brought sharply into focus by director John Hillcoat with the aid of a fine musical score by Nick Cave. The story is bleak and cruel and there is a lot of extreme violence. But is does create a mood.

1584620,A1Y0HX12MCT6OR,B009369Z8A,I'm Right,"[1, 5]","Lawless is an early 1930's period piece about the bootlegging business between three hick brothers who try to maintain their moonshine business with cops and competition crawling up their asses. This movie is very pretty to look at, the music is well done and interesting (covering newer songs to sound older), and the actors sell their roles pretty well. The problem I had with Lawless though was the overall story, tone, characters, and pacing; and here's why:-Characters: So our protagonist in this film is the youngest of the brothers who's grown up a coward who wants to be a tough guy businessman like his brothers, however he doesn't really find his balls until 20 minutes before the movie's over and makes dumb decisions throughout the film that jeopardizes his family. So we have a flawed protagonist, not really a big deal, it sort of adds depth to him, although all the depth that's given to him makes his character your standard cookie-cutter underdog ripped from countless Hollywood stories and not much else. The middle brother is basically just the family wildcard, and the oldest brother is the quiet reserved badass that pretty much runs the family business himself.So this is your trio of characters the movie is 'based on', there's almost no depth to any of them if you've seen Hollywood underdog gangster movies before. Then you have sub-characters, such as Rickety Cricket who was a former priest turned cokehea-wait, wrong Rickety Cricket. Crickety Ricket, who is the token smart guy, fixes the bootlegging equipment and machinery and is the youngest brother's timid nice friend who ends up being the second act martyr to move along to the third act. The youngest brother's love interest also plays a small role simply as 'love interest', and she just giggles and repeats ""if my daddy were here"", ""my daddy don't like you"", ""my daddy this"", ""my daddy that"", etc. You also have Gary Oldman, who was barely in the film and his name was slapped on for marketing purposes as the intimidating mobster who buys from the brothers for no reason other than he recognized the younger brother's face.But now onto my favorite character: the evil FBI agent who wears all black, looks like a pale sickly Nazi, and pretty much tortures anyone who crosses him, all the while the police officers turn a blind eye. Early in the movie he asks someone ""do you think I'm stupid?"", which he apparently is since he does nothing the entire film but piss off the entire town (including the police officers). Also, you're supposed to believe that in the 1920's everyone in a Southern town that wasn't a criminal was a total coward. The agent saunters around town and terrorizes the populace without anyone raising questions or just shooting the guy. Sure he was a federal agent, but I think murdering the town cripple in cold blood would lead to his titles being stripped away from him at least. Sure there was some message about how fear controls people, but that's more applicable now with people sitting inside watching the media, not in the 1930's where people were still settling across the country.So there's little depth to any of the characters, hell even Pulp Fiction had more character depth to it. But what about the story? Well the story is basically the agent slowly snaking his way farther and farther up the brother's asses until they decide to retaliate, which is the end of the movie. The story itself is kind of interesting, family protecting their business and what have you. One thing that was weird about the pace was how predictable it got. After the agent arrives into town, there would be a few 5 minute scenes where the youngest brother and his love interest would be flirting, and then SUDDENLY 20 MINUTES OF GRAPHIC VIOLENCE & DRAMA!!!! There was virtually no build-up to the climax of the movie because the pace never changed from STOP-GO-STOP-GO.There were also a few scenes that were either plain stupid or plain annoying. Like for instance the police find the bootleg still, and the brothers never think to just burn the place down while the cops are there. Also in that scene, the youngest brother comes across the agent who's in his mercy, and before this scene, the agent beat the royal s*** out of the brother. So what does the brother do now in this opportune moment? Step on the agent's face and call him a queer or something. He doesn't break the guys teeth, he doesn't bruise up the guys face or kick him in the balls, no, our hero does nothing but some anti-climactic love tap then walks away. Also at the end of the movie, the youngest brother is pissed since his token smart best friend is dead, and wants to shoot the agent. So what does he do? He goes up to a police roadblock where the agent is among a dozen cops, and points his gun at all of them, and doesn't get shot immediately. No, the bad guy has to slither out from the darkness (literally) and shoot the brother. It's dumb, stupid, Hollywood s*** like this that pisses me off from these kinds of movies.So it was entertaining most of the time in a 'how far will they take it this time' sorta way, it almost felt like a graphic novel or something due to the violence. Again, the music was great, which makes sense considering it was from the talented Nick Cave who also scored the infinitely better period piece: The Assassination of Jesse James. The acting was decent and so was the whole design, it was just unrealistic, shallow, and stupid a lot of the time.",3,Mediocre Bloodbath,1353974400,"11 27, 2012",2012,5460,"['Lawless', 'early',

1584625,A2BFIYZYNK54QX,B009369Z8A,"James Donnelly ""Ave Atque Vale""","[3, 4]","LAWLESS, the second collaboration between Director John Hillcoat and Writer/Composer/All-Around Weird Dude Nick Cave, is a film that has just about everything working in its favor: It has a trememdous cast, some excellent and vibrant performances, some crackling scenes of dialogue and some beautiful scene composition. So why can't I get past everything that it doesn't have that it needed to put it on the same level as their first collaborative effort, an amazing and little-seen film called THE PROPOSITION?LAWLESS, based on a book of non-fiction called ""The Wettest County In The World"", is based during the later years of Prohibition in Franklin County, Virginia and based around the Bondurant brothers, who became a little less than folk-heroes and a little more than outlaws during those years. They, like many of the families in Franklin County, are Moonshiners and they're pretty good at it. The eldest, Howard (Jason Clarke, most recognizable for his recent turn in the excellent but short-lived THE CHICAGO CODE) is a strong-armed but dull-witted man who samples a little too much of his own product. The middle child is Forrest (Tom Hardy, best known for just about every other film in the last two years), who is something of a legend amongst the community already for being ""immortal"", by surviving the illness that killed their parents when he was just a boy. Jack (Shia LaBeouf, discarding most of his annoying mannerisms here) is ""the runt of the litter"", skinny and scared, but brainy and ambitious and anxious to prove his worth in the family business to Forrest who really runs the show. They are put upon by a Federal agent or ""Special Deputy"" named Charlie Rakes (Guy Pearce, who also starred in THE PROPOSITION) who is looking not to clean things up Eliot Ness style, but looking to make a buck by shaking down the locals for protection money. This leads the local law to side, at least for a while, with Rakes, as Jack and his best friend Cricket (Dane Dehaan) look to sell their goods to a big-time gangster (Gary Oldman) and also romance a young preacher's daughter (Mia Wasikowska). Another unusual visitor comes to town in the visage of Maggie (Jessica Chastain), looking to escape the hustle of the big city and soon finds herself caring for Forrest in a way she never would have expected.The film's biggest strength is also one of its main failings, and that's the setting. The incredibly rural setting of a Prohibition-era drama is something that is not seen very often, because the majority of them take place in the big cities (although a film like Sam Mendes' ROAD TO PERDITION is partially set in the boonies), and that's something that a director like Hillcoat and a writer like Cave would feel like they would want to immerse the viewer into that world, but we only catch glimpses. It seems like the setting is more incidental rather than a necessary part of the storytelling. Everyone in it is good with really three stand-out performances: Tom Hardy is excellent as the soft-spoken but deadly Forrest who acts as the patriarch for his brothers; Guy Pearce is amazing and chameleon-like as the needlessly sadistic and sweet-scented Rakes who is trying to be the city gent, but is too brutal and cruel to ever be accepted as such. Every scene of his drips with menace. Also standing out here is Dane Dehaan (wonderful in the brilliant little-seen gem CHRONICLE) as Cricket, the resident mechanical genius and hero-worshipping child whose vulnerability is extended beyond that of a cliche. LaBoeuf takes his time with his character in building it and turns in a very commendable performance in easliy his most complex role yet. The rest of the cast work best with what they have but what they have isn't much. Mia Wasikowska has a wonderful scene with LaBoeuf as he takes her out for a drive, but that's really the extent of her character as something for the young Jack to long for. Jason Clarke is the most short-changed of the Bondurants here, being portrayed as a drunk and a thug, but little else. Gary Oldman has little more than a cameo in this film, and from a completely subjective point of view, I wanted more because there was something there to really allow for him to have fun and cut loose like we had seen in years past. Sadly the one player here that is the most marginalized is Jessica Chastain. She's an actress that will undoubtedly have an Oscar in her hand before the decade is out, and she does some really good work here, but her character of Maggie is very much the weary and damaged madonna/whore for Forrest, and very little else.Another real problem is the pacing of the film. It's not that it's uneven; it's that it's too fast. This film moves along at such a brisk pace that at its little over 100-minute runtime seems too brief for a film of this type. I felt like I was being rushed out of the theater rather than being invited in to experience something unusual and lyrical, like Hillcoat and Cave's THE PROPOSITION. That was a film that took the Western out of the ""Old West"" and placed it in Austrailia's Outback, and it invited the viewer to really soak in all the elements of the environment the film was set in, which were strange and wonderful and terrible. This is honestly the first time in a while where I felt that a longer runtime would have benefitted the film, particularly from a character standpoint.LAWLESS, while being beautiful to look at and well-performed, is sadly lacking heart and soul that could have easily elevated this film to greater heights. But in all fairness, when LAWLESS works, it works really well, and that does happen slightly more often than not.3/5 Stars.",3,"When LAWLESS works, it's great, but the Devil is in the

Matt Bondurant knew his grandfather Jack Bondurant and his grand-uncles Forrest and Howard were bootleggers. This led to the historical novel The Wettest County in the World (2008). The book wound up in the hands of director John Hillcoat (The Road, The Proposition).""Bootlegging sort of drew the Bondurants into this crazy kind of world of corruption and lawlessness ironically,"" Hillcoat said. ""But then mostly they survived, they got through it all and actually went on to have businesses and children. And traditionally the gangster film teaches us that we've to  pay for our sins. Usually the gangster is shot down in a blaze of glory and doesn't get up again.""In the movie Lawless, the Bondurant brothers have created this almost immortal image. And according to how much of this actually happened, they certainly live up to that image.It's 1931 and the brothers are the most successful bootleggers in Franklin County, Virginia. Cricket Pate runs their bar, which is a cover for their illegal venture.Maggie Beauford, a dancer from Chicago, arrives and becomes their new waitress.The brothers have been selling moonshine to everyone from clergy to law enforcement. Special Deputy Charley Rakes confronts Forrest and tells him things will be changing, that all profits made by bootleggers will stop.

I think the world has had enough of Shia LaBeouf by now, too, but if this somehow ends up being his last high-profile gig then at least he went out on a high note.  He would not have been among my first ten casting choices for this role, but I found his presence less annoying in ""Lawless"" than in most everything else I've seen him in.But this movie belongs to Tom Hardy, hands down.  Anyone familiar with Hardy's body of work knows that he can deliver the goods (""Bronson"", anyone?).  He has such a dynamic and commanding presence about him that you can't take your eyes off him.  When he's not onscreen you can't wait for him to come back.  He was the best thing about ""The Dark Knight Rises"".  In fact, he was the ONLY good thing about ""The Dark Knight Rises"".  He'll get more profile for that film than for many of his others, and that's unfortunate too considering how weak that material was.Between ""Bronson"", ""Lawless"", and 2011's ""Warrior"" (and shame on you if you haven't watched all three of these), Hardy's place as one of his generation's best and most versatile screen actors is secured.The other thing about ""Lawless"" I didn't care for was how a few songs seemed to get shoe-horned into the story when simple, subtle background score would have sufficed.  It was distracting.  But Nick Cave wrote a few of those and he gets paid more than just his screenwriter's salary if his songs make it into the film and onto the soundtrack, so there you go.  I noticed the same pattern in ""The Proposition"", another film Cave wrote and contributed songs for.  Cave co-wrote the score for ""The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford"" and that music was quite good, so I'm not on an anti-Cave rant here.""Lawless"" is bloody and violent too, so leave the kids in the other room.  But it's a superior genre piece and worth watching.And I have nothing against seeing a little female flesh now and again, but I thought Jessica Chastain's nude scene was gratuitous.  I certainly didn't DISlike it, but in my head I was screaming ""Okay, apparently it is time for the obligatory ingenue nude scene.

1584666,ADCC3WHSZNW1R,B009369Z8A,J. Richardson,"[0, 0]","Note: May contain spoilers. Proceed with caution.So I recently got around to watching Lawless for the first time and I must admit I was pretty impressed. Going in I wasn't really sure what to expect. I don't remember seeing any trailers leading up to its release and I ultimately had no clue what it was about. All I really knew was that Shia LaBeouf was in it. While the film probably won't find its way into my list of favorites, it's hard not to appreciate just how good it actually is.Based on a true story, what isn't these days, Lawless follows the lives of the three Bondurant brothers during the prohibition era. Forrest (Tom Hardy), Howard (Jason Clarke), and Jack (LaBeouf) run a moonshine business and while these three actors may not look similar in appearance, their chemistry on screen more than makes up for it. Forrest is the oldest, and possibly the wisest, Howard is a hothead, and Jack is pretty much the runt of the group who lacks the fearlessness that his brothers have. The movie lets you know this from the get-go as a younger Jack is unable to pull the trigger on a pig on his dad's farm.Everything seems to be going ok for the three brothers until Charlie Rakes (Guy Pearce) comes along. Charlie is a deputy from Chicago who was sent to crack down on the bootlegging currently going on in Franklin County, Virginia. Even though I hated his character with a passion Pearce did a phenomenal job at bringing this character to life, which seems to be a common theme among the entire cast.As I watched the film part of me felt that Jack was supposed to be the main character. He was the one you were supposed to care about the most, but I found it hard to do that when Tom Hardy comes through and just dominates his performance as Forrest. I don't remember the last time I've seen an actor get so into his character. Off the top of my head I can only think of two: Heath Ledger in The Dark Knight and Joseph Gordon-Levitt in 50/50. As I watched the film on the couch I truly felt intimidated by Forrest. Here was a man who did not give a single damn. He didn't do what he did because he wanted to, he does it out of necessity. Out of his sheer will to live. Hardy's character doesn't necessarily have a lot of dialogue, but sometimes it's his silence or his facial expressions that say more than any dialogue ever could.Some minor roles include Maggie (Jessica Chastain), Bertha Minnix (Mia Wasikowska), Cricket (Dane DeHaan), and Floyd Banner (Gary Oldman). Just like the main cast these supporting actors give outstanding performances. Maggie is a former dancer from Chicago who wanted to get away from the city life. She winds up being the waitress at the Bondurant gas station and also, later on, Forrest's love interest. Bertha is a young Amish woman who Jack is obviously attracted to. At first I thought that her role felt forced and insignificant, but it later proves to be more important than I initially thought. Cricket is a friend of Bondurant brothers who helps with their moonshine business. And Floyd Banner is a mobster who later becomes an ally to Jack. As previously stated, each of these actors brought their A-game. However, it would be criminal of me if I didn't give a little bit of recognition to Gary Oldman. The man has maybe a total of 20 lines throughout the entire movie, but, just like Hardy, he put it all on the table. He made himself Floyd Banner and he's just a joy to watch.As a whole I felt the story was solid. The only part that really annoyed me was that they had a main character (Jack) who is unable to do what needs to be done until the situation gets as bad as it could possibly get. I don't know about anyone else, but to me that whole scenario is extremely overdone in movies like this. It says it's based on a true story, but there was obviously some tweaks made to make it a better cinematic experience. There were a few scenes that felt slightly unnecessary, but all in all everything flowed together really well and was presented by some nearly flawless camera work. The cherry on top? Well that would have to be the fantastic score produced by Nick Cave and Warren Ellis. It has that classic Country-Western vibe without feeling overwhelming and there were a few times during the darker scenes where I felt chills rush down my spine.Overall Score: 8/10 - Considering I had little to no knowledge about this movie going in I have to admit that the final result was more than satisfying. The story may not be perfect, but it's held together by some good pacing, a strong cast, a great score, and some phenomenal acting. If you're into gangster-esque films and you have two hours to kill I definitely recommend giving this this a shot.",4,8/10 - Good,1365724800,"04 12, 2013",2013,4702,"['Note', 'May', 'contain', 'spoilers', 'Proceed', 'caution.So', 'recently', 'got', 'watching', 'Lawless', 'first', 'time', 'must', 'admit', 'was', 'pretty', 'impressed', 'Going', 'was', ""n't"", 'really', 'sure', 'what', 'expect', 'do', ""n't"", 'remember', 'seeing', 'trailers', 'leading', 'up', 'release', 'ultimately', 'had', 'clue', 'what', 'was', 'about', 'really', 'knew', 'was', 'Shia', 'LaBeouf', 'was', 'film', 'probably', 'wo', ""n't"", 'find', 'way', 'list', 'favorites', 'hard', 'not', 'appreciate', 'just', 'how', 'good', 'actually', 'is.Based', 'true', 'story', 'what', ""n't"", 'days', 'Lawless', 'lives', 'three', 'Bondurant', 'brothers', 'prohibition', 'era', 'Forrest', 'Tom', 'Hardy', 'Howard', 'Jason', 'Clarke', 'Jack', 'LaBeouf', 'run', 'moonshine', 'business', 'three', 'actors', 'may', 'not', 'look', 'similar', 'appearance', 'chemistry', 'screen', 'more', 'up', 'Forrest', 'oldest', 'possibly', 'wisest', 'Howard', 'hothead', 'Jack', 'pretty', 'much', 'runt', 'group', 'who', 'fearlessness', 'brothers', 'have', 'movie', 'know', 'get-go', 'younger', 'Jack', 'unable', 'pull', 'trigger', 'pig', 'dad', 'farm.Everything', 'be', 'going', 'ok', 'three', 'brothers', 'Charlie', 'Rakes', 'Guy', 'Pearce', 'along', 'Charlie', 'deputy', 'Chicago', 'who', 'was', 'sent', 'crack', 'down', 'bootlegging', 'currently', 'going', 'Franklin', 'County', 'Virginia', 'Even', 'hated', 'character', 'passion', 'Pearce', 'did', 'phenomenal', 'job', 'bringing', 'character', 'life', 'be', 'common', 'theme', 'entire', 'cast.As', 'watched', 'film', 'part', 'felt', 'Jack', 'was', 'supposed', 'be', 'main', 'character', 'was', 'one', 'were', 'supposed', 'care', 'most', 'found', 'hard', 'do', 'when', 'Tom', 'Hardy', 'just', 'performance', 'Forrest', 'do', ""n't"", 'remember', 'last', 'time', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'actor', 'get', 'so', 'character', 'top', 'head', 'can', 'only', 'think', 'two', 'Heath', 'Ledger', 'Dark', 'Knight', 'Joseph', 'Gordon-Levitt', '50/50', 'watched', 'film', 'couch', 'truly', 'felt', 'intimidated', 'Forrest', 'Here', 'was', 'man', 'who', 'did', 'not', 'give', 'single', 'damn', 'did', ""n't"", 'do', 'what', 'did', 'because', 'wanted', 'necessity', 'sheer', 'will', 'live', 'Hardy', 'character', ""n't"", 'necessarily', 'have', 'lot', 'dialogue', 'silence', 'facial', 'expressions', 'say', 'more', 'dialogue', 'ever', 'could.Some', 'minor', 'roles', 'include', 'Maggie', 'Jessica', 'Chastain', 'Bertha', 'Minnix', 'Mia', 'Wasikowska', 'Cricket', 'Dane', 'DeHaan', 'Floyd', 'Banner', 'Gary', 'Oldman', 'Just', 'main', 'cast', 'supporting', 'actors', 'give', 'outstanding', 'performances', 'Maggie', 'former', 'dancer', 'Chicago', 'who', 'wanted', 'get', 'away', 'city', 'life', 'up', 'being', 'waitress', 'Bondurant', 'gas', 'station', 'also', 'later', 'Forrest', 'love', 'interest', 'Bertha', 'young', 'Amish', 'woman', 'who', 'Jack', 'obviously', 'attracted', 'first', 'thought', 'role', 'felt', 'forced', 'insignificant', 'later', 'be', 'more', 'important', 'initially', 'thought', 'Cricket', 'friend', 'Bondurant', 'brothers', 'who', 'helps', 'moonshine', 'business', 'Floyd', 'Banner', 'mobster', 'who', 'later', 'ally', 'Jack', 'previously', 'stated', 'actors', 'brought', 'A-game', 'However', 'would', 'be', 'criminal', 'did', ""n't"", 'give', 'little', 'bit', 'recognition', 'Gary', 'Oldman', 'man', 'maybe', 'total', '20', 'lines', 'entire', 'movie', 'just', 'Hardy', 'put', 'table', 'made', 'Floyd', 'Banner', 'just', 'joy', 'watch.As', 'whole', 'felt', 'story', 'was', 'solid', 'only', 'part', 'really', 'annoyed', 'was', 'had', 'main', 'character', 'Jack', 'who', 'unable', 'do', 'what', 'be', 'done', 'situation', 'as', 'bad', 'could', 'possibly', 'get', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'anyone', 'else', 'whole', 'scenario', 'extremely', 'overdone', 'movies', 'based', 'true', 'story', 'there', 'was', 'obviously', 'tweaks', 'made', 'make', 'better', 'cinematic', 'experience', 'were', 'few', 'scenes', 'felt', 'slightly', 'unnecessary', 'everything', 'flowed', 'together', 'really', 'well', 'was', 'presented', 'nearly', 'flawless', 'camera', 'work', 'cherry', 'top', 'Well', 'would', 'have', 'be', 'fantastic', 'score', 'produced', 'Nick', 'Cave', 'Warren', 'Ellis', 'classic', 'Country-Western', 'vibe', 'feeling', 'overwhelming', 'were', 'few', 'times', 'darker', 'where', 'felt', 'chills', 'rush', 'down', 'spine.Overall', 'Score', '8/10', 'Considering', 'had', 'little', 'knowledge', 'movie', 'going', 'have', 'admit', 'final', 'result', 'was', 'more', 'satisfying', 'story', 'may', 'not', 'be', 'perfect', 'held', 'together', 'good', 'pacing', 'strong', 'cast', 'great', 'score', 'phenomenal', 'acting', ""'re"", 'gangster-esque', 'films', 'have', 'two', 'hours', 'kill', 'definitely', 'recommend', 'giving', 'shot']",N/A

A period piece about the outlaw Bondurant family of Virginia, the movie has gritty action set in the time of Prohibition. What's not to love? It also features an incredible A-list cast including Tom Hardy, Jessica Chastain, Shia LaBeouf, Gary Oldman, Guy Pearce, and Mia Wasikowska. An impressive collection! It was also written by the eternally cool Nick Cave inspired by the fantastic biography ""The Wettest County in the World."" On paper, this had the potential to be one of the best film's of the year. And yet, something never really connected with me about ""Lawless."" It's a well made film, to be sure, but the story and its characters just didn't come alive enough to separate this from other Prohibition era dramas that have preceded it. I felt like I'd seen this tale many times before, and oftentimes with more depth. ""Lawless"" may still be worth seeing (especially for the cast), it just never felt particularly special to me. And that was a huge let-down.LaBeouf, Hardy, and Jason Clarke play the Bondurant brothers. As local bootleggers, they developed into regional legends. Deemed indestructible, they ruled the roost in Franklin County. But situations started to turn tense as the corrupt officials (fronted by an oily Pearce) wanted to get in on the profits. The Bondurants, led by a scary Hardy, were not one to bend and a battle of wills ensue. The youngest brother (LaBeouf) attempts to take a larger role and enlists the aid of a notorious gangster (Oldman) to keep the family in power. The movie is structured as a series of escalating confrontations and the violence is well orchestrated and choreographed. The ladies (Chastain and Wasikowska) both seem to be in underwritten parts, and never figure very prominently into the action. In fact, on a fundamental level, I never felt particularly close to any of the characters and as we are supposed to consider them outlaw heroes--this was a big problem for me.The tagline even states: ""They were brothers who became outlaws, and outlaws who became heroes."" I never felt it, though. The screenplay does not demonstrate what was unique and/or inspiring about this clan. The real life Bondurants had an incredible back story, but in the movie--I was never sure why I was supposed to be rooting for them. I liked ""Lawless"" overall. It was a perfectly acceptable entertainment. It just falls short of what might have been. Hardy continues to impress, Oldman is a lot of fun, and Pearce has got some great hair (and no eyebrows). But the film showed me nothing new. About 3 1/2 stars, this is probably not a film I'd add to my must-see collection.

I guess the film makers felt obliged to do this in order to create a ""date movie"" for female audiences, but they spent so much time on the romantic subplots that the action heart of the film got lost.The really interesting love story here was the love of Guy Pearce's character for himself.

This is how the story goes: The true story of the infamous Bondurant Brothers: bootlegging siblings who made a run for the American Dream in Prohibition-era Virginia. Inspired by true-life tales of author Matt Bondurant's family in his novel ""The Wettest County In The World,"" the loyalty of three brothers is put to the test against the backdrop of the nation's most notorious crime wave.The cast led by Shia LaBeouf (as Jack), Tom Hardy (as Forrest), Gary Oldman (as Floyd Banner), Mia Wasikowska (as Bertha), Jessica Chastain (as Maggie), Jason Clarke (as Howard) & Guy Pearce (as Charlie Rakes) is great. The directing by John Hillcoat is great. The screenplay (based on Matt Bondurant's novel) by Nick Cave (who also did the music) is great.The music by Cave & Warren Ellis is great. The cinematography by Benoit Delhomme is great. The film editing by Dylan Tichenor is great. The casting by Francine Maisler is great. The production design by Chris Kennedy is great. The art direction by Gershon Ginsburg, Sharon Davis (also set design) is great. The set decoration by Maria Nay, set dresses by Julie Hardin, Konrad Lewis, Taraja Ramsess, JoAnna Robinson, Mike Samuels, Kip Bartlett & Nichole Wleklinski is great. The costume design by Margot Wilson is great. The special effects coordinated by David Fletcher is great. The visual effects coordinated by Joey Bonander & Andrew G. Cox, supervised by Dick Edwards, Bill Taylor & Mark Stetson is great. The stunts coordinated by Mickey Giacomazzi & John T. Cypert is great. The special make-up design by David LeRoy Anderson is great.This is a great crime drama that is entertaining and well-made, as well, as well-crafted, too. Shia LaBeouf & Tom Hardy, who is terrific as Forrest, lead a well-acted cast. This is also a gritty and thrilling movie that is well-designed and detailed, visually. John Hillcoat & Nick Cave have done another terrific and entertaining movie together, in the line with their collaborations together, ""The Road"" & ""The Proposition"".

Those reviewers apparently reviewed this DVD set based upon the theatrical release of the movie.  I enjoyed Lawless in a big-screen movie theater and appreciated it enough to want to own it on DVD.There have already been so many heartfelt and passionate comments published here about the movie itself, its acting and plot, ranging from ""love"" to ""hate"" therefore I will not focus on those aspects other than to repeat my review's headline; ""If you loved the move, you'll like this DVD set.""  These disks obviously will not make you like the movie if you hated it in the theater, do not like violence, period movies or do not like having to focus on details and sometimes obscure dialog in order to keep up with the plot and character development.There is graphic violence and a considerable amount of artistry in how the sets, music, sounds and costumes were created and filmed.  Those were reproduced well both in Blu-ray and on the standard DVD.  Colors, details and the visual dynamic range and audio were captured well on disk.  I enjoyed the bonus feature, which included comments from most of the leading actors except for Gary Oldman, about how they worked together to create this movie.  Using foreign actors to play the leading parts no doubt required considerable dialog coaching to make this movie, set in rural Virginia, seem authentic.This movie was based upon real events in America's past during Prohibition and does a good job, in my opinion, of taking you there.",5,"If You Loved the Movie, You'll Like This DVD Set",1357603200,"01 8, 2013",2013,1614,"['Based', 'dates', 'reviews', 'were', 'written', 'submitted', 'Blu-ray', 'set', 'was', 'ever', 'released', 'public', 'reviewers', 'apparently', 'reviewed', 'DVD', 'set', 'based', 'theatrical', 'release', 'movie', 'enjoyed', 'Lawless', 'big-screen', 'movie', 'theater', 'appreciated', 'enough', 'want', 'own', 'DVD.There', 'have', 'already', 'been', 'so', 'many', 'heartfelt', 'passionate', 'comments', 'published', 'here', 'movie', 'acting', 'plot', 'ranging', 'love', 'hate', 'therefore', 'will', 'not', 'focus', 'aspects', 'other', 'repeat', 'review', 'headline', 'loved', 'move', ""'ll"", 'like', 'DVD', 'set', 'disks', 'obviously', 'will', 'not', 'make', 'movie', 'hated', 'theater', 'do', 'not', 'violence', 'period', 'movies', 'do', 'not', 'having', 'focus', 'details', 'sometimes', 'obscure', 'dialog', 'order', 'keep', 'up', 'plot', 'character', 'development.There', 'graphic', 'violence', 'considerable', 'amount', 'artistry', 'how', 'sets', 'music', 'costumes', 'were', 'created', 'filmed', 'were', 'reproduced', 'well', 'Blu-ray', 'standard', 'DVD', 'Colors', 'details', 'visual', 'dynamic', 'range', 'audio', 'were', 'captured', 'well', 'disk', 'enjoyed', 'bonus', 'feature', 'included', 'comments', 'most', 'leading', 'actors', 'Gary', 'Oldman', 'how', 'worked', 'together', 'create', 'movie', 'Using', 'foreign', 'actors', 'play', 'leading', 'parts', 'doubt', 'required', 'considerable', 'dialog', 'coaching', 'make', 'movie', 'set', 'rural', 'Virginia', 'seem', 'authentic.This', 'movie', 'was', 'based', 'real', 'events', 'America', 'past', 'Prohibition', 'good', 'job', 'opinion', 'taking', 'there']",N/A

1584720,A2DAHERP7HYJGO,B009369Z8A,Mark Turner,"[2, 3]","It's been years since the theme of bootleggers was the subject matter in movies. Back in the 70s there was a rush of movies about this subject ranging from the low budget MOONRUNNERS (the movie later turned into the hit TV series THE DUKES OF HAZARD) to the even lower budgeted MOONSHINERS. Even Burt Reynolds took on the subject in WHITE LIGHTNING. But then it kind of disappeared. That all changed when reality TV took a shine (pun intended) to the topic and the film LAWLESS is a result of that renewed interest.Based loosely on the real life story of the three Bondurant brothers in Franklin County, Virginia, the story focuses on a short period of their lives when bootlegging was their claim to fame and the end result was what was called a war in their home county. Descendants of the real life family have written a book on the subject and that is what the film is based on.The Bondurant brothers were legends in Franklin County. Oldest brother Forrest (Tom Hardy) was said to be indestructible having crossed paths with death on several occasions. Middle brother Howard (Jason Clarke) has perhaps decided to dip into the family recipe too often but remains the muscle of the group. The youngest brother, Jack (Shia LeBouf) is the upstart, trying to think of ways to impress his older brother Forrest and increase the profits of their bootlegging venture. But Forrest is content to sit back and make the money that he does from their product and pay his bribe money to the local sheriff.All that changes when a new prosecutor comes to town. Charlie Rakes (Guy Pearce) is part of a task force that was sent to shut down the stills but who in truth is more interested in taking over the entire county's bootlegging business. When Forrest refuses to comply, Rakes sets out to destroy the Bondurant family in any way possible. The result is a violent and bloody confrontation that leaves Forrest wounded but alive and his brothers ready for revenge. But that is not to happen yet.Jack decides the best way to increase their finances is to begin selling their product to Chicago gangster Floyd Banner (Gary Oldman). With the country dry due to prohibition, Jack can get good money from the mobster in return for supplying the demand the gangsters need for their town. While the brothers may disagree on this item the money does come in handy at the right time.Rakes' men having been behind the attack on Forrest and the brutalization of a waitress and love interest of Forrest (Jessica Chastain) that same night have left a bad taste in the mouths of the brothers. When they blow up their still and murder Jack's best friend in cold blood, a harmless young boy who had no chance of being a problem to Rakes, the brothers can take no more. An eventual showdown between the corrupt lawman and the bootleggers is inevitable. It's bloody but not overly so and the results are surprising.LAWLESS does a great job of capturing the era and area that the film takes place in. The back hills of Virginia look beautiful rather than wasted away and yet the people who live there looks as poor as the times the story takes place in. While bootlegging may have paid the bills for poor farmers who made more money this way it was not the glamorous life that say cocaine dealers have been depicted in more modern stories. These were tough men who did what they had to to feed their families and keep their farms. The work was hard and the rewards merely enough to get by. There was no glitz and glamour here.The acting here is stupendous. Tom Hardy turns in another dynamite performance as a man who uses few words and fewer actions yet carries the threat of violence about him like an aura. His character knows the ways of the world and tries to convey them with little success to his younger brother. LeBouf does a great job as well, depicting a hero worshipping brother who wants to do well by his family yet gets turned down more often than not. Pearce is equal to these two in depicting a bad guy that even law abiding citizens will find themselves hoping gets his due.The movie doesn't offer a pretty picture of the bootlegging business but it does offer a few new anti-heroes for viewers to root for. You care about this family and the others who faced these problems in the past. It was a violent world that handled things much differently than they are handled today. And that makes for some tremendous storytelling that just might make viewers want to find out more and read about those times.",4,PROHIBITION MOUNTAIN STYLE,1354233600,"11 30, 2012",2012,4491,"['been', 'years', 'theme', 'bootleggers', 'was', 'subject', 'matter', 'movies', 'Back', '70s', 'was', 'rush', 'movies', 'subject', 'ranging', 'low', 'budget', 'MOONRUNNERS', 'movie', 'later', 'turned', 'hit', 'TV', 'series', 'THE', 'DUKES', 'OF', 'HAZARD', 'even', 'lower', 'budgeted', 'MOONSHINERS', 'Even', 'Burt', 'Reynolds', 'took', 'subject', 'WHITE', 'LIGHTNING', 'then', 'kind', 'disappeared', 'changed', 'when', 'reality', 'TV', 'took', 'shine', 'pun', 'intended', 'topic', 'film', 'LAWLESS', 'result', 'renewed', 'interest.Based', 'loosely', 'real', 'life', 'story', 'three', 'Bondurant', 'brothers', 'Franklin', 'County', 'Virginia', 'story', 'short', 'period', 'lives', 'when', 'bootlegging', 'was', 'claim', 'fame', 'end', 'result', 'was', 'what', 'was', 'called', 'war', 'home', 'county', 'Descendants', 'real', 'life', 'family', 'have', 'written', 'book', 'subject', 'what', 'film', 'based', 'on.The', 'Bondurant', 'brothers', 'were', 'legends', 'Franklin', 'County', 'Oldest', 'brother', 'Forrest', 'Tom', 'Hardy', 'was', 'said', 'be', 'indestructible', 'having', 'crossed', 'paths', 'death', 'several', 'occasions', 'Middle', 'brother', 'Howard', 'Jason', 'Clarke', 'perhaps', 'decided', 'dip', 'family', 'recipe', 'too', 'often', 'muscle', 'group', 'youngest', 'brother', 'Jack', 'Shia', 'LeBouf', 'upstart', 'trying', 'think', 'ways', 'impress', 'older', 'brother', 'Forrest', 'increase', 'profits', 'bootlegging', 'venture', 'Forrest', 'content', 'sit', 'back', 'make', 'money', 'product', 'pay', 'bribe', 'money', 'local', 'sheriff.All', 'when', 'new', 'prosecutor', 'town', 'Charlie', 'Rakes', 'Guy', 'Pearce', 'part', 'task', 'force', 'was', 'sent', 'shut', 'down', 'stills', 'who', 'truth', 'more', 'interested', 'taking', 'over', 'entire', 'county', 'bootlegging', 'business', 'When', 'Forrest', 'comply', 'Rakes', 'out', 'destroy', 'Bondurant', 'family', 'way', 'possible', 'result', 'violent', 'bloody', 'confrontation', 'Forrest', 'wounded', 'alive', 'brothers', 'ready', 'revenge', 'not', 'happen', 'yet.Jack', 'best', 'way', 'increase', 'finances', 'begin', 'selling', 'product', 'Chicago', 'gangster', 'Floyd', 'Banner', 'Gary', 'Oldman', 'country', 'dry', 'due', 'prohibition', 'Jack', 'can', 'get', 'good', 'money', 'mobster', 'return', 'supplying', 'demand', 'gangsters', 'need', 'town', 'brothers', 'may', 'disagree', 'item', 'money', 'come', 'handy', 'right', 'time.Rakes', 'men', 'having', 'been', 'attack', 'Forrest', 'brutalization', 'waitress', 'love', 'interest', 'Forrest', 'Jessica', 'Chastain', 'same', 'night', 'have', 'left', 'bad', 'taste', 'mouths', 'brothers', 'When', 'blow', 'up', 'still', 'murder', 'Jack', 'best', 'friend', 'cold', 'blood', 'harmless', 'young', 'boy', 'who', 'had', 'chance', 'being', 'problem', 'Rakes', 'brothers', 'can', 'take', 'more', 'eventual', 'showdown', 'corrupt', 'lawman', 'bootleggers', 'inevitable', 'bloody', 'not', 'overly', 'so', 'results', 'are', 'surprising.LAWLESS', 'great', 'job', 'capturing', 'era', 'area', 'film', 'place', 'back', 'hills', 'Virginia', 'look', 'rather', 'wasted', 'away', 'yet', 'people', 'who', 'live', 'there', 'as', 'poor', 'times', 'story', 'place', 'bootlegging', 'may', 'have', 'paid', 'bills', 'poor', 'farmers', 'who', 'made', 'more', 'money', 'way', 'was', 'not', 'glamorous', 'life', 'say', 'cocaine', 'dealers', 'have', 'been', 'depicted', 'more', 'modern', 'stories', 'were', 'tough', 'men', 'who', 'did', 'what', 'had', 'feed', 'families', 'keep', 'farms', 'work', 'was', 'hard', 'rewards', 'merely', 'enough', 'get', 'was', 'glitz', 'glamour', 'here.The', 'acting', 'here', 'stupendous', 'Tom', 'Hardy', 'dynamite', 'performance', 'man', 'who', 'few', 'words', 'fewer', 'actions', 'threat', 'violence', 'aura', 'character', 'ways', 'world', 'tries', 'convey', 'little', 'success', 'younger', 'brother', 'LeBouf', 'great', 'job', 'as', 'well', 'depicting', 'hero', 'worshipping', 'brother', 'who', 'do', 'well', 'family', 'yet', 'turned', 'down', 'more', 'often', 'not', 'Pearce', 'equal', 'two', 'depicting', 'bad', 'guy', 'even', 'law', 'abiding', 'citizens', 'will', 'find', 'hoping', 'due.The', 'movie', ""n't"", 'offer', 'pretty', 'picture', 'bootlegging', 'business', 'offer', 'few', 'new', 'anti-heroes', 'viewers', 'root', 'care', 'family', 'others', 'who', 'faced', 'problems', 'past', 'was', 'violent', 'world', 'handled', 'things', 'much', 'differently', 'are', 'handled', 'today', 'tremendous', 'storytelling', 'just', 'might', 'make', 'viewers', 'want', 'find', 'out', 'more', 'read', 'times']",N/A

1584727,A3Q07NIIS6V2CT,B009369Z8A,"Mia N. Searles ""The Muses Circle""","[5, 8]","*Note* **There is actually more that goes with this review on my blog since I saw an advance screening of Lawless in the beginning of August and met the author of the book this movie is based on, Matt Bondurant. Matt's grandfather is Jack Bondurant (played by Shia LaBeouf) and Howard and Forrest were his granduncles. To read my full post on meeting Matt and getting to talk to him about how his family saga got turned into a movie, do a google search for The Muses Circle, click on Movie Reviews, and scroll down to Lawless.**I absolutely have nothing negative to say about Lawless. Some critics have complained that while the acting was top notch, the story itself was derivative. Are there elements of the plot that we've seen in other films before? Yes. But does is straight up copy another movie? No. But let's get it straight. The point of Lawless was never to give us something we've completely never seen before. Come on, this is not the Matrix. Hillcoat's vision was to give us a twist on the gangster genre, give us something a little less conventional. So while there were elements that felt familiar, there were also scenes that you just didn't expect; scenes that perhaps you expected to go one way, but ended up playing out completely different. I have a couple scenes in mind but I don't want to spoil anything.In my opinion, Nick Cave did a great job with the script and the soundtrack. I liked Jack's bits of narration throughout the film. The movie was well paced-- my mind never wandered nor did I feel bored. So if some of you are hesitating to see Lawless because you're worried that the action or scenes of violence are far and wide between, you have nothing to worry about. Cave is more known as a song writer and composer then he is for writing scripts. So I had a feeling the soundtrack was going to be interesting. It was a breath of fresh air. Instead of going with the traditional sound of straight up blue grass, country music (remember this movie is part western, part gangsteresque), he somehow mixed in some new with some old.Now to the outstanding cast of Lawless. You may disagree with everything I've said so far, but one thing that cannot be denied is the amazing acting in this film, even for those who have less screen time. I'll be the first to admit I am not a Shia LaBeouf fan. Walking into this movie, I thought I was going to have to just ignore him and pray the other actors would be able to carry him. While I still won't be the first person lined up to see his next movie, I have to give credit where credit is due: Shia LaBeouf can act. From his southern drawl to his convincing performance as a boy that still hasn't quite transitioned into manhood, I think he did a great job playing Jack Bondurant.Jason Clarke who portrays the eldest brother in the Bondurant clan Howard, was a bit overshadowed by other performances, but I won't soon forget those eyes. They are eyes that have seen things that no man should ever have the burden of seeing and it's no surprise why he drowns himself in moonshine. The way Clarke was able to sometimes appear ""tuned out"" out was impressive.Gary Oldman as gangster Floyd Banner was electrifying, but shorter then expected. It's one of those cases where Hollywood uses an actor's name to draw people into the film, but they aren't actually in the majority of it.Jessica Chastain is a great actress so I wasn't surprised by her solid, strong female performance as Maggie. I loved how she could walk into a room and instantly remind the rough-around-the-edges Bondurant boys of their manners in the presence of a lady. The other lady in the movie, Mia Wasikowska, who plays Bertha (Jack's love interest) was as perfect as always. She is young but can hang with the heavyweights as she has proven in previous performances in Jane Eyre and Albert Nobbs.If you are looking for a villain you will hate as much as the characters do in the film, then you will love Guy Pearce's spin on Special Deputy Rake. Pearce is probably one of the most underrated but brilliant actors around and I am glad that the part went to him since Rake as a character is quite interesting. He's from the city, wears perfume, appears to look the part of a gentlemen but we soon realize underneath the nice clothes, coifed hair, and girly smell, there's something not quite...right. Like the gloves he wears and the naked African American girl in his room that he has sitting on newspapers on top of his bed. Yeah...check it out, you will see what I mean.I think the character that I least expected to connect with was Cricket and the credit has to go to Dane DeHaan. I kept thinking he was the younger version of Leonardo DeCaprio and I don't know why but his performance in Lawless reminded me of DeCaprio as Arnie in What's Eating Gilbert Grape. The physical likeness of the two is uncanny. I can't wait to see DeHaan evolve over time.Okay, so I had to save the best for last. I promise to keep my praise of this next actor as short as possible since there are really no words that can fully describe his performance. You just need to see it. Tom Hardy was compelling as Forrest Bondurant, the middle brother and the head of the family. I read somewhere that the director John Hillcoat was ""awestruck"" by Hardy's performance. I think I was awestruck when I saw Hardy as Bane in The Dark Knight Rises, but let me say this: I don't need any more proof, he is a phenomenal actor. Any actor that can wear a Mr. Rogers' cardigan and remain sexy, masculine, and still be the baddest dude on screen is just amazing. Hardy always makes Forrest appear relaxed, yet intense. His mannerisms such as the way he walks, talks is a pleasure to watch. Forrest is the glue that keeps everything in his world together and I am not just talking about his importance as the businessman in the family. Forrest has to keep a watchful eye on his older brother Howard who can fly off the handle in a second, who can at times appear tuned out and sometimes wonder if it is all from the moonshine or from the horrors he saw at war. Then on the other end is young Jack, his baby brother that he knows isn't quite cut out for the lifestyle but knowing and trying to convince the youngest in the Bondurant family are two different beasts. I'm not saying Forrest couldn't have been played by another actor, but Tom Hardy brought something special to the character that could never be replicated.I think John Hillcoat has succeeded in his goal. He has given us a western/gangster flick that feels familiar yet still maintains its freshness. If you're looking for a film with a solid story, great acting, with nicely paced bursts of violence, look no further. Lawless has arrived. But let us not give all the credit to Hollywood for there would be no movie without Matt Bondurant and his novelization of his grandfather and granduncle's legend sized escapades. I read somewhere that Matt Bondurant's one regret was that he never spent enough time with his grandfather as so often happens with young people. That maybe writing Wettest County in the World was his way to honor the memory of the man he knew and the man he wished he had had the time to get to know. Don't worry, Matt. Grandpa Jack would be proud.Mia @ themusescircle.blogspot.com",5,"It is Not the Violence That Sets Men Apart, It is the Distance He is Prepared to Go...",1346544000,"09 2, 2012",2012,7265,"['*Note*',

1584729,A17LEYMZI8OYOQ,B009369Z8A,"Michael B. Druxman ""A Good Story is a Terribl...","[2, 3]","LAWLESS is inspired by the essentially true and fascinating adventures of the legendary, seemingly ""indestructible,"" Bondurant Brothers, bootleggers in Prohibition-era Virginia, who went to war against corrupt politicians and, in doing so, became heroes to their neighbors.Shia LeBeouf, Tom Hardy and Jason Clarke play the backwoods siblings.  They only want to make an ""honest"" living, selling their moonshine at a fair price to people in their community, but when a crooked special deputy (Guy Pearce) demands a large cut of their action, the brothers refuse and that leads to violence, torture and murder.Adapted for the screen by composer Nick Cave from a novel (based on fact) by Matt Bondurant, grandson of the character played in the film by LeBeouf, LAWLESS features a cast of intriguing, multi-dimensional characters, portrayed by some of the most talented actors in films today.  Jessica Chastain, as an emotionally damaged woman from Chicago who comes to work for the brothers, Mia Wasikowska, as a Mennonite girl courted by LeBeouf, and Gary Oldman, playing a big city gangster on the run, are also memorable in their rolesDirector John Hillcoat and his team have flawlessly re-created backwoods Virginia of the early 1930s.  His action sequences are well staged and riveting.Unfortunately, the film does have several slow spots, caused by the fact that the screenplay lacks focus.  Too much time is spent on two romantic subplots (i.e. LeBeouf/Wasikowska, Hardy/Chastain), which are, in themselves, touching, but these sequences distract from the primary storyline, the conflict between the brothers and Pearce's character.  LeBeouf serves as the narrator of the movie and has top billing, yet the filmmakers never make clear whether this is his story or Hardy's.Anchor Bay Entertainment has issued LAWLESS in a 3-disc (Blu-Ray/DVD/Digital) combo pack.  Extras include audio commentary by director Hillcoat and author Matt Bondurant, deleted scenes, a music video and several featurettes that discuss the real brothers and the making of the film.ichael B.

However, this movie, while not perfect, kept my attention and delighted me.  Tom Hardy's character did not not have much to work with in the way of the script, but his character is a man of few words who does more with his actions and mannerisms.  Hardy did a good job with his character, creating a facade of invulnerability and toughness with a soft spot for his family and friends.  Shia LaBeouf, whose previous work I have not been a fan of, was actually rather good as the junior Bondurant who is eager to prove himself, but is callow and unsure of himself.  In my view, Guy Pearce, as the foppish, preening, self-absorbed, inhumane deputy from Chicago stole the film.  You really hated him and when Pearce was on the screen, you noticed little else.  Pearce was in the movie Prometheus, and was, in my view, the weak link in that film from an acting perspective, but in this film he really brought his character to life.From what I can gather about Prohibition and the history of it, ""The Wettest Country in the World"" is more than a little over the top, and this movie is also over the top.  However, sometimes the Moonshiners did resort to violence and there were lawmen who were corrupt and on the take.  Therefore, this movie is almost certainly a composite of the worst elements of the Prohibition Era, and it is a well-told story that is engaging the interesting.There is some violence and nudity.  Sensitive and younger viewers should be warned.  However it is not over the top.

They make a decent living until a crooked politician vows to eliminate all the small sellers.

Oldest brother Forrest (Tom Hardy) and Howard (Jason Clarke) are hulking men who essentially want to be left alone.  Alas, they won't be.As he did in ""The Proposition"" (2005) and 2009's ""The Road,"" Hillcoat doesn't shy away from violence, and aside from a couple instances, it comes with viciousness and realism.  The film does slip occasionally, usually when Jack does something really stupid knowing of their situation.

1584745,A3TO3AY1UFM83U,B009369Z8A,"not a natural ""Bob Bickel""","[0, 0]","I live in West Virginia on the border with Kentucky and have had work-related reasons to visit Franklin County.  Much of it is still little different from its appearance and portrayal in the first-rate film Lawless.As presented in Lawless, Franklin County might be characterized as ""Bloody Franklin,"" roughly comparable to Harlan County or ""Bloody Harlan,"" the setting for never-ending, violent conflict between coal miners on their way to early graves from Black Lung and gun thugs aided and abetted by corrupt officials working for Big Coal.  Lawless, however, takes a different, though equally ugly and violent tack, focusing on the production and distribution of bootleg whiskey.Lawless romanticizes the lives and times of bootleggers in unashamed fashion, presenting them as tough-as-a-nickel-steak  heroes with a good deal of homespun integrity.  By contrast, their most conspicuous adversaries are caricatures of legally sanctioned viciousness and in-your-face arrogance, outsiders whose pomade can't cover their lack of character, something shared only by real men who have done what they have to in making their way in a hostile world.That said, how does the viewer see Lawless as something with more gravity than backwoods, slack-jawed campiness?  One way is to take Lawless seriously as an allegory for life in the Appalachian U.S.  There, in rural West Virginia, Pennsylvania, and Kentucky, the contrast between right and wrong, good and bad, decent and decadent are as clear cut, plain to see, and fraught with peril as in a mainland China forced labor camp.  In a lot of places in our world, subtlety, nuance, shades of gray, and understatement are artificial contrivances that misrepresent rather than clarify.  Contrary to aesthetically mandated conventional wisdom, some stories really do have only one side.  If you're afflicted with a really powerful aversion to this accurately simplified view of much of the world, you won't like Lawless any more than you'd like, say, John Sayles' movie Matewan or the Norwegian film The King of Devil's Island.  You'll find it just too easy to make hard and fast moral judgments.Lawless, however, is not devoid of artful and well-wrought irony.  The good guys are the law breakers, trying to get by in a hard place during the hardest of times.  With or without free booze, the local cops are sympathetic to their mountain-bred brethren and they rein in the worst excesses of their nominal allies sent in from the outside.  The lead character, played by Shia LeBouf, is not the feckless loose cannon that first appearances might lead us to expect him to be.  Jessica Chastain really is looking for peace and quiet, a reprieve from the chaos, grime, and random cruelty of city life.  Tom Hardy's fanciful run in with natural causes proves to be more of a challenge than knives and bullets that draw blood in anger.LeBouf does a good job of maintaining his unlikely clean-cut boyishness throughout the film, but it would be good to know more about him.  Mia Waiskowska inserts a believable streak of independence and a good deal of cultural contrast into her Amish-like character as Lebouf's love interest, though LeBouf's peaceable dinner with her family may be a bit far-fetched.  Tom Hardy is always likable, though he plays his character so low-key that he could serve as a stand-in for Mumbles, one of Hardy's friends in the black comedy Rock'n'Rolla.  Guy Pearce does a superb job as official Hooveresque evil personified.Lawless is by no means a perfect film, but it's a lot of fun with excitement and intensity to spare.  I liked it, and I'll watch it again.  Blood flows freely in this violent world, evoking the dark, violent, and, yes, lawless themes that pervade this part of our planet.",5,"""Bloody Franklin,"" Excuse the Pseudonym",1363996800,"03 23, 2013",2013,3752,"['live', 'West', 'Virginia', 'border', 'Kentucky', 'have', 'had', 'work-related', 'reasons', 'visit', 'Franklin', 'County', 'Much', 'still', 'little', 'different', 'appearance', 'portrayal', 'first-rate', 'film', 'Lawless.As', 'presented', 'Lawless', 'Franklin', 'County', 'might', 'be', 'characterized', 'Bloody', 'Franklin', 'roughly', 'comparable', 'Harlan', 'County', 'Bloody', 'Harlan', 'setting', 'never-ending', 'violent', 'conflict', 'coal', 'miners', 'way', 'early', 'graves', 'Black', 'Lung', 'gun', 'thugs', 'aided', 'abetted', 'corrupt', 'officials', 'working', 'Big', 'Coal', 'Lawless', 'however', 'different', 'equally', 'ugly', 'violent', 'tack', 'focusing', 'production', 'distribution', 'bootleg', 'whiskey.Lawless', 'lives', 'times', 'bootleggers', 'unashamed', 'fashion', 'presenting', 'tough-as-a-nickel-steak', 'heroes', 'good', 'deal', 'homespun', 'integrity', 'contrast', 'most', 'conspicuous', 'adversaries', 'are', 'caricatures', 'legally', 'sanctioned', 'viciousness', 'in-your-face', 'arrogance', 'outsiders', 'pomade', 'ca', ""n't"", 'cover', 'lack', 'character', 'something', 'shared', 'only', 'real', 'men', 'who', 'have', 'done', 'what', 'have', 'making', 'way', 'hostile', 'said', 'how', 'viewer', 'see', 'Lawless', 'something', 'more', 'gravity', 'backwoods', 'slack-jawed', 'campiness', 'One', 'way', 'take', 'Lawless', 'seriously', 'allegory', 'life', 'Appalachian', 'U.S', 'rural', 'West', 'Virginia', 'Pennsylvania', 'Kentucky', 'contrast', 'right', 'wrong', 'good', 'bad', 'decent', 'decadent', 'are', 'clear', 'cut', 'plain', 'see', 'fraught', 'peril', 'mainland', 'China', 'forced', 'labor', 'camp', 'lot', 'places', 'world', 'subtlety', 'nuance', 'shades', 'gray', 'understatement', 'are', 'artificial', 'contrivances', 'misrepresent', 'rather', 'clarify', 'Contrary', 'aesthetically', 'mandated', 'conventional', 'wisdom', 'stories', 'really', 'do', 'have', 'only', 'one', 'side', ""'re"", 'afflicted', 'really', 'powerful', 'aversion', 'accurately', 'simplified', 'view', 'much', 'world', 'wo', ""n't"", 'like', 'Lawless', 'more', ""'d"", 'like', 'say', 'John', 'Sayles', 'movie', 'Matewan', 'Norwegian', 'film', 'King', 'Devil', 'Island', ""'ll"", 'find', 'just', 'too', 'easy', 'make', 'hard', 'fast', 'moral', 'judgments.Lawless', 'however', 'not', 'devoid', 'artful', 'well-wrought', 'irony', 'good', 'guys', 'are', 'law', 'breakers', 'trying', 'get', 'hard', 'place', 'hardest', 'times', 'free', 'booze', 'local', 'cops', 'are', 'sympathetic', 'mountain-bred', 'brethren', 'rein', 'worst', 'excesses', 'nominal', 'allies', 'sent', 'outside', 'lead', 'character', 'played', 'Shia', 'LeBouf', 'not', 'feckless', 'loose', 'cannon', 'first', 'appearances', 'might', 'lead', 'expect', 'be', 'Jessica', 'Chastain', 'really', 'looking', 'peace', 'quiet', 'reprieve', 'chaos', 'grime', 'random', 'cruelty', 'city', 'life', 'Tom', 'Hardy', 'fanciful', 'run', 'natural', 'causes', 'be', 'more', 'challenge', 'knives', 'bullets', 'draw', 'blood', 'anger.LeBouf', 'good', 'job', 'maintaining', 'unlikely', 'clean-cut', 'boyishness', 'film', 'would', 'be', 'good', 'know', 'more', 'Mia', 'Waiskowska', 'believable', 'streak', 'independence', 'good', 'deal', 'cultural', 'contrast', 'Amish-like', 'character', 'Lebouf', 'love', 'interest', 'LeBouf', 'peaceable', 'dinner', 'family', 'may', 'be', 'bit', 'far-fetched', 'Tom', 'Hardy', 'always', 'likable', 'character', 'so', 'low-key', 'could', 'serve', 'stand-in', 'Mumbles', 'one', 'Hardy', 'friends', 'black', 'comedy', 'Rock', ""n'Rolla"", 'Guy', 'Pearce', 'superb', 'job', 'official', 'Hooveresque', 'evil', 'personified.Lawless', 'perfect', 'film', 'lot', 'fun', 'excitement', 'intensity', 'spare', 'liked', ""'ll"", 'watch', 'again', 'Blood', 'freely', 'violent', 'world', 'evoking', 'dark', 'violent', 'yes', 'lawless', 'themes', 'pervade', 'part', 'planet']",N/A

1584784,A1DUT6O3BWXEJ,B009369Z8A,"Shawn Gordon ""gordy the ghoul""","[0, 0]","Australian John Hillcoat is without a doubt one of the most fascinating filmmakers working today, an heir to a style of filmmaking that not only seems dead now, but long so. His movies are beauties to behold, they are character driven, action filed and deal with themes of displaced men and time. His new movie, Lawless, is no exception, to say it fails to reach the same heights as his two previous pictures is not a criticism so much as an observation, it's not as powerful as the highly regarded stark western the Proposition nor is it as deeply moving as his underrated adaptation of Cormac McCarthy's the Road. With a recent output like that, it would be tough to continue or equal it, yet Lawless is still a sensational motion picture, not just one of the year's very best, but a strong identifiable work that will be appreciated for a long time to come.Working from a screenplay by musician Nick Cave, who also wrote the excellent script for the Proposition, adapted from the fact based book by Matt Bondurant (grandson of one of the film's actual protagonists) the Wettest County in the World, Hillcoat's original movie title. Set in rural America of the prohibition era, Lawless tells what Cave calls ""a true myth"" about the Bondurant brothers, outlaw heroes of the Virginia hill country, moonshiners who not only defy the law, but as legend has it are invincible because of the many perils that they have overcome and survived that would kill lesser men. None more audacious than middle brother, Forrest (Tom Hardy), who is either blessed or actually is  immortal, his survival skill is something to consider.When a big city special agent, Charlie Rakes (Guy Pearce) comes into Franklin county, not so much to put a stop to the brothers illegal activities, but looking for part of the take. Hostilities between the Bondurants and the law escalates to also include big city gangsters like Floyd Bonner (Gary Oldman). The conflict eventually grows into outright warfare between the lot of them.Things aren't all bloodshed and death, as youngest brother Jack (Shia LeBouf), while trying to prove himself as a worthy heir to the family legacy, also finds himself courting a local preacher's daughter, Bertha (Mia Wasikowska). But the real love story develops between Forrest and Maggie Beauoral (Jessica Chastin), a city girl, who comes to Franklin county looking to outrun a past best left forgotten. The two wounded souls with hard exteriors are able to unleash their inner tenderness together.Hillcoat has returned macho cinema to a glorious unflinching place from it's celebrated bloodstained past. His best work recalls the films of maverick hard men directors like Sam Peckinpah, Sam Fuller, Raoul Walsh, and other ambitious auteurs often with a reputation for the lurid, perhaps never more so than with Lawless. Combining elements of the urban gangster film and the western outlaw hero stories, pooled before with mixed results in pictures such as Walter Hill's Last Man Standing and the superior Sam Elliott telefilm You Know My Name, here with greater results. Everything at this juncture is a work of masterful film art, great production and attention to period details, sharp camera work (by Benoit Delhomme), taunt editing, a memorable score and first rate performances.Impeccably told in a style that gives a real sense of time and place. We gain a real feel for the people and the locations. This is the kind of movie that you can smell in your mind, from the unkempt Bonderants to the more dandy Rakes.LeBouf is reasonably good in the role of Jack, playing a timid, semi-weak young man transformed into a cocky, arrogant hothead. LeBouf is an alright actor who sometimes gets undue flack, however, he lacks the real strength to fully carry a film like this, he's a little too blas&eacute; to be a good leading man. That's why we have Tom Hardy, who with his portrayal of Forrest Bondurant, fully comes into his own as a movie star, this is the one that should transfix him into a household name. Hardy dominates every scene he is in, he walks away with the movie after kicking it in the teeth and leaving it bludgeoned over the head.The supporting cast is just as superb, in fact Lawless couldn't be all that it is without the small, but crucial work done by Jessica Chastain, who is not only one of the most exciting presences on film today, but seems to be as impervious to bad film roles as the Bondurants are to bereavement. Guy Pearce, who has appeared in Hillcoat's two previous masterworks, is ferocious and unrelenting as the essentially strong antagonist, it`s remarkably to think of all the many different type of roles we`ve seen Pearce do in the recent past. Mia Wasikowska with her ethereal beauty and infectious smile adds a perfect counter balance to the testosterone fueled antics on screen. Gary Oldman is always a welcome presence, even if it is just a cameo as it is here, but he looks cool and snazzy with a tommy gun.The score by Cave and Warren Ellis is something of genius unto it's elf. Cave, providing new music with a special one off band, cheekily called the Bootleggers, as well as incorporating tunes beautiful sung by Emmylou Harris, the soundtrack not only assists the movie, but helps to more fully tell it's story. Cave and his bootleggers give a thrilling rendition of Lou Reed's Velvet Underground classic ""White Light, White Heat"", match by a winning bluegrass interruption by Ralph Stanley played over the picture's closing credits. The supplementary CD release of the soundtrack album is via Sony Classical, proving that even the label recognizes the artistry in the accompanying music.Lawless is a rip roaring thrilling adventure. A gun totting, gin soaked action drama. It's all that, with the kick of a mule captured in a bottle of pure grain white lightning and white heat.see my reviews at moviezonemagazine.com",4,whsikey soaked depression-era

It was gripping at every turn and gave you a sense of wanting the not so good but not so bad guys to win.  The story about the 3 moonshine slicking brothers was excellent.  Lots of action - couple of sad parts - mostly a happy ending -lots of awkward moments.  Only thing is that you kind of wish Shia would have been a little more assertive than being his usual (getting kicked in the pants) and then getting strength toward the end kind of guy in this film (basically he was the weaker of the 3).  Tom Hardy made me smile so many times just because his demeanor in this film was very typical but he played this character so well - you over see it.

No comments or summaries regarding plot, acting and the like as they can be found most everywhere else, so I will only focus on the quality of the BluRay transfer and disc itself.The video transfer is really quite good with largely a warm color grading for most scenes.  The film has strong and deep blacks but retains details in the shadows while maintaining a softer focus in many areas of backgrounds and the foreground when the foreground is not where the camera wants to focus. I saw no artifacts or stair stepping in any of the scenes, especially of the wooded scenes where one might expect to see such things in the high grass or leafs.  Over all, this blu ray is really very good.The audio is DTS HD 5.1 and the films sports a wonderful soundtrack.  I may even buy the soundtrack on iTunes as Nick Cave did a fine job with it. The audio, both music and dialogue sounded open and transparent; that's what uncompressed audio can accomplish.  The majority of the audio is spread very nicely across the front soundstage with very good directionality from both the front left and right speakers with proper and appropriate panning between them.  While there is not a whole lot of discreet channeling to the rears, the rear sound stage is comfortably used for the panning of cars and a lower volume soundtrack and ambience.  Your LFE channel is put to task for the several explosions that go deep but, IMHO, could have gone deeper but I am nit picking on this point.The extras are an abbreviated music video of one of the tracks song by Willie Nelson and some very interesting extras regarding the history of Harlan County and the family the film is based upon.One of my long time pet peeves with any BluRay or Standard Def DVDs is the inclusion of old or future previews as they take up space which could be used to lower the compression ratios of the films and forces the buyer to pay for advertising.  Lawless, unfortunately has a few movie previews included and I hate that.Never the less, this was a very enjoyable movie and the quality of the blu ray will have me go out and purchase it for the collection.All my movie reviews are of this nature and focus only on the quality of the transfer to BluRay so check them and see if they are of help as well.Hopefully, this review has been of some help to you in determining your purchase, hope I am on the correct path with a review of the transfer quality as opposed to providing plot summaries.Thanks",4,Lawless on Blu Ray,1356912000,"12 31, 2012",2012,2543,"['did', ""n't"", 'buy', 'BluRay', 'rented', 'Redbox', 'assume', 'are', 'differences', 'comments', 'summaries', 'regarding', 'plot', 'acting', 'like', 'can', 'be', 'found', 'most', 'everywhere', 'else', 'will', 'only', 'focus', 'quality', 'BluRay', 'transfer', 'disc', 'itself.The', 'video', 'transfer', 'really', 'quite', 'good', 'largely', 'warm', 'color', 'grading', 'most', 'scenes', 'film', 'strong', 'deep', 'blacks', 'details', 'shadows', 'maintaining', 'softer', 'focus', 'many', 'areas', 'backgrounds', 'foreground', 'when', 'foreground', 'not', 'where', 'camera', 'focus', 'saw', 'artifacts', 'stair', 'stepping', 'scenes', 'especially', 'wooded', 'scenes', 'where', 'one', 'might', 'expect', 'see', 'such', 'things', 'high', 'grass', 'leafs', 'blu', 'ray', 'really', 'very', 'good.The', 'audio', 'DTS', 'HD', '5.1', 'films', 'sports', 'wonderful', 'soundtrack', 'may', 'even', 'buy', 'soundtrack', 'iTunes', 'Nick', 'Cave', 'did', 'fine', 'job', 'audio', 'music', 'dialogue', 'sounded', 'open', 'transparent', 'what', 'uncompressed', 'audio', 'can', 'accomplish', 'majority', 'audio', 'spread', 'very', 'nicely', 'front', 'soundstage', 'very', 'good', 'directionality', 'front', 'left', 'right', 'speakers', 'proper', 'appropriate', 'panning', 'not', 'whole', 'lot', 'discreet', 'channeling', 'rears', 'rear', 'sound', 'stage', 'comfortably', 'used', 'panning', 'cars', 'lower', 'volume', 'soundtrack', 'ambience', 'LFE', 'channel', 'put', 'task', 'several', 'explosions', 'go', 'deep', 'IMHO', 'could', 'have', 'gone', 'deeper', 'am', 'nit', 'picking', 'point.The', 'extras', 'are', 'abbreviated', 'music', 'video', 'one', 'tracks', 'song', 'Willie', 'Nelson', 'very', 'interesting', 'extras', 'regarding', 'history', 'Harlan', 'County', 'family', 'film', 'based', 'upon.One', 'long', 'time', 'pet', 'peeves', 'BluRay', 'Standard', 'Def', 'DVDs', 'inclusion', 'old', 'future', 'previews', 'take', 'up', 'space', 'could', 'be', 'used', 'lower', 'compression', 'ratios', 'films', 'buyer', 'pay', 'advertising', 'Lawless', 'unfortunately', 'few', 'movie', 'previews', 'included', 'hate', 'less', 'was', 'very', 'enjoyable', 'movie', 'quality', 'blu', 'ray', 'will', 'have', 'go', 'out', 'purchase', 'collection.All', 'movie', 'reviews', 'are', 'nature', 'focus', 'only', 'quality', 'transfer', 'BluRay', 'so', 'check', 'see', 'are', 'help', 'well.Hopefully', 'review', 'been', 'help', 'determining', 'purchase', 'hope', 'am', 'correct', 'path', 'review', 'transfer', 'quality', 'opposed', 'providing', 'plot', 'summaries.Thanks']",N/A

The official sound track is done rather well and is laden with folksy bluegrass songs; please see my separate review of the OST.Lawless does take its time to the `meat of the movie', after an hour or so, when Jack Bondurant ( played by Shia Lebeouf's ) starts selling liquor to gangster Floyd Banner (played by Gary Oldman, his role is brief) With the beginning of this new partnership the law, both local and state, squeezes in on the brothers.The film is violent, and the images linger: you will see a man tarred and feathered and dumped on the porch; Tom Hardy's throat being slit from ear to ear; a women who you see at the beginning, of what is implied is going to be a brutal rape, Floyd Banner hitting Noah Taylor with a spade; and by far the worse for me was Pearce sneering in disgust as he gets blood on his lilac leather gloves after bashing Shia Lebeouf's face, who is begging for mercy.

At the same time, you're trying to get out from under the shadow of your elders, one of whom is a local legend. Which takes priority?The Bondurant brothers are the owners and operators of the premier bootlegging operation in Franklin County, Virginia. Jack, the youngest (portrayed by Shia LaBouef) is assisting Howard (played by Jason Clarke) and Forrest (played by Tom Hardy) when he witnesses a shooting. The gunman, Floyd Banner (played by Gary Oldman), locks eyes with young Jack before he departs for the operation's headquarters. Once there, Forrest (Hardy) hires a new waitress. Her name is Maggie Beauford (played by Jessica Chastain) and she is a former dancer who's recently moved to Franklin County from Chicago. Shortly after that, the bootlegging business is confronted with an obstacle. Charlie Rakes, another new arrival and a Special Deputy. Rakes (played by Guy Pearce) tells Forrest that, from now on, he and his superiors will be given a percentage of the profits form their business. Forrest, as expected, sends Rakes away and threatens to kill him if he returns. After his departure, Forrest organizes a meeting of his colleagues in the illegal alcohol business. His hope is to rally them into a resistance movement. ""Bootleggers of the world unite"" if you will. While they are receptive, initially, it's only a matter of time before they capitulate to Deputy Rakes. In the meantime, Jack has become enamored with Bertha Minnix. Bertha (played by Mia Wasikowska) is the daughter of a local German Baptist preacher who forbids Bertha from seeing Jack once he attends one of his services drunk and leaves abruptly.This film is supposedly based on a historical novel written by the grandson of LaBouef's character. I don't know how faithful the film is to the novel or how historically accurate the novel is, but as far as I'm concerned, the movie failed. It isn't particularly awful, but it's not all that interesting either. I am surprised that former Disney star Shia LaBouef has actual talent, but he does and we've seen it. I am not at all surprised by the fact that Tom Hardy is talented as he has demonstrated it on numerous occasions.
