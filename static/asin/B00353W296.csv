The acting is mediocre at best. I have never turned off a movie, but I just couldn't bare it any longer. It was turned off in the first 15 minutes.This sounded like it would be a good movie, but poor quality on the camera action and the acting... who knows maybe they will sell the rights to someone who can actually work a camera..",1,movie is to shaky,1395360000,"03 21, 2014",2014,473,"['Just', 'first', 'few', 'minutes', 'had', 'fast', 'forward', 'camera', 'was', 'shaking', 'so', 'much', 'actually', 'gave', 'motion', 'sickness', 'acting', 'mediocre', 'best', 'have', 'never', 'turned', 'off', 'movie', 'just', 'could', ""n't"", 'bare', 'longer', 'was', 'turned', 'off', 'first', '15', 'minutes.This', 'sounded', 'would', 'be', 'good', 'movie', 'poor', 'quality', 'camera', 'action', 'acting', 'who', 'maybe', 'will', 'sell', 'rights', 'someone', 'who', 'can', 'actually', 'work', 'camera..']",Blood Red Moon

And it's nowhere near as good.If you've seen Twilight you'll know this plot; young girl starts at new 'school' (which seems to have a single class). Meets young intiguing guy. Falls in love, thinks he's a vampire, and so on.Even the ""Blood-red moon"" is a pale brown!",1,No light,1274313600,"05 20, 2010",2010,335,"['agree', 'other', 'reviewer', 'blatant', 'Twilight', 'rip-off', 'nowhere', 'near', 'good.If', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'Twilight', ""'ll"", 'know', 'plot', 'young', 'girl', 'new', ""'school"", 'have', 'single', 'class', 'Meets', 'young', 'intiguing', 'guy', 'Falls', 'love', 'vampire', 'so', 'on.Even', 'Blood-red', 'moon', 'pale', 'brown']",Blood Red Moon
