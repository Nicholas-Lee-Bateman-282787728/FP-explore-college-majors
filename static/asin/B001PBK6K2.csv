1226861,A1E9SNNS24DA02,B001PBK6K2,"Amazon Customer ""chickenlittle25""","[18, 19]","Another reviewer here already did a really wonderful job of listing all of the chapters in this dvd, so I won't waste your time going over it again.If you are considering buying this dvd, it's important that you know what it is, and what it is not.This is a wonderful drills dvd. Sometimes I just want to practice a choreography for the troupe I'm involved with, and sometimes I just want to work on my form.  The latter is just what this dvd is for.  This is a great dvd for perfecting your form, gaining strength and flexability. Sadie does a pretty good job of explaining how to do each movement, and there is enough repetition to get your muscles and muscle memory working! I for one appreciate this sort of thing, because I am terrible at coordinating my own practice sessions when it comes down to just working on my form.If you are looking to learn a little dance, there is a choreography section near the end of the dvd, and you will learn a cute little dance from that.If you are looking for an exercise type dvd, like the videos by Neena and Veena that sort of incorporate bellydance moves into an aerobic routine....this is not the video for you.  Also, if you are looking for a fancy choreography, this is also probably not going to make you happy.The format of the dvd is wonderful.  You can see Sadie from the back and from the front as she is facing a mirror.  This is GREAT! I wish more dvds would have this sort of set up.  This way the instructor does not have to think and correct for rights/lefts the way they would if they are directly facing the camera.  If you have read any of my other reviews I am very harsh on ""teachers"" who say to move right but then move to your left or vice versa.  The lack of coordination between what you are hearing and seeing is very distracting for many people.  That is not a problem in this video at all due to the use of the mirror. For the most part, the camera is focused on where it should be.  Sadie's outfit allows you to see what her body parts are doing without looking like she is just trying to see how much skin she can show.  The background is pleasant and the picture and sound quality are very good.  Instruction is given by Sadie as you go through each movement, it's not done via voiceover (not that I mind a good voiceover, but some find them creepy), and to me, the feeling is just about as close as you are going to get to being in the room with a real instructor as possible on video.This is a good practice/technique dvd for beginners and intermediates.  I think advanced students might find this a bit too simplistic.  Also, please note, even though I said that it feels ALMOST like being in the room with an actual instructor, if you have never ever taken bellydance lessons before, I urge you to find a real life teacher who can watch what you are doing and make sure you are using proper form, even if you only go for a few sessions. Proper form is essential for keeping your knees and back healthy!  Thank you for reading. :)",5,Great practice!,1294531200,"01 9, 2011",2011,3006,"['reviewer', 'here', 'already', 'did', 'really', 'wonderful', 'job', 'listing', 'chapters', 'dvd', 'wo', ""n't"", 'waste', 'time', 'going', 'are', 'considering', 'buying', 'dvd', 'important', 'know', 'what', 'what', 'not.This', 'wonderful', 'drills', 'dvd', 'Sometimes', 'just', 'want', 'practice', 'choreography', 'troupe', ""'m"", 'involved', 'sometimes', 'just', 'want', 'work', 'form', 'latter', 'just', 'what', 'dvd', 'great', 'dvd', 'perfecting', 'form', 'gaining', 'strength', 'flexability', 'Sadie', 'pretty', 'good', 'job', 'explaining', 'how', 'do', 'movement', 'enough', 'repetition', 'get', 'muscles', 'muscle', 'memory', 'working', 'one', 'appreciate', 'sort', 'thing', 'am', 'terrible', 'coordinating', 'own', 'practice', 'sessions', 'when', 'down', 'just', 'working', 'form.If', 'are', 'looking', 'learn', 'little', 'dance', 'choreography', 'section', 'end', 'dvd', 'will', 'learn', 'cute', 'little', 'dance', 'that.If', 'are', 'looking', 'exercise', 'type', 'dvd', 'videos', 'Neena', 'Veena', 'sort', 'incorporate', 'bellydance', 'moves', 'aerobic', 'routine', '.this', 'not', 'video', 'Also', 'are', 'looking', 'fancy', 'choreography', 'also', 'probably', 'not', 'going', 'make', 'happy.The', 'format', 'dvd', 'wonderful', 'can', 'see', 'Sadie', 'back', 'front', 'facing', 'mirror', 'GREAT', 'wish', 'more', 'dvds', 'would', 'have', 'sort', 'set', 'up', 'way', 'instructor', 'not', 'have', 'think', 'correct', 'rights/lefts', 'way', 'would', 'are', 'directly', 'facing', 'camera', 'have', 'read', 'other', 'reviews', 'am', 'very', 'harsh', 'teachers', 'who', 'say', 'move', 'right', 'then', 'move', 'left', 'vice', 'versa', 'lack', 'coordination', 'what', 'are', 'hearing', 'seeing', 'very', 'distracting', 'many', 'people', 'not', 'problem', 'video', 'due', 'use', 'mirror', 'most', 'part', 'camera', 'focused', 'where', 'should', 'be', 'Sadie', 'outfit', 'see', 'what', 'body', 'parts', 'are', 'doing', 'looking', 'just', 'trying', 'see', 'how', 'much', 'skin', 'can', 'show', 'background', 'pleasant', 'picture', 'sound', 'quality', 'are', 'very', 'good', 'Instruction', 'given', 'Sadie', 'go', 'movement', 'not', 'done', 'voiceover', 'not', 'mind', 'good', 'voiceover', 'find', 'creepy', 'feeling', 'just', 'about', 'as', 'close', 'are', 'going', 'get', 'being', 'room', 'real', 'instructor', 'possible', 'video.This', 'good', 'practice/technique', 'dvd', 'beginners', 'intermediates', 'think', 'advanced', 'students', 'might', 'find', 'bit', 'too', 'simplistic', 'Also', 'please', 'note', 'even', 'said', 'ALMOST', 'being', 'room', 'actual', 'instructor', 'have', 'never', 'ever', 'taken', 'bellydance', 'lessons', 'urge', 'find', 'real', 'life', 'teacher', 'who', 'can', 'watch', 'what', 'are', 'doing', 'make', 'sure', 'are', 'using', 'proper', 'form', 'even', 'only', 'go', 'few', 'sessions', 'Proper', 'form', 'essential', 'keeping', 'knees', 'back', 'healthy', 'Thank', 'reading']",Sadie's Complete Bellydance Guide

1226863,A1ZYA1450LWBXF,B001PBK6K2,Amazon Customer,"[4, 4]","In my years of learning the amazing art of belly dancing (and finding myself a beginner all over again every now and then) I've come across basic instructional videos of all flavors. There are some that are created with the belief that there's no point, right at the beginning, making it all hard work and no fun. And there are others are made to focus on building foundations that are totally flawless, leaving the fun up to the learner. Of course there are also those that strike a balance between the two.So, Sadie's instructional videos tip towards the hard work category, which means they're not for someone who wants to go through the video a few times and sass up the dance floor on Saturday. This is a beginner DVD, but it's all about technique. It's also very comprehensive, going from simple hip swings all the way to traveling steps and a mini choreography It wouldn't be wrong to describe it as a whole course, taught with expertise and focus. There's not much fooling around, not too many light moments - but some people want just that. In fact, I was looking for something to refresh my basics without wasting time chatting and cheerleading and found this a good option. Because Sadie talks and explains while she's making you do the moves, so there's no need to stand around and wait for long explanations to be through, except for a section on posture.A short warm-up of stretches kicks off the video. As is usual with belly dance basics, you then go through arms, shoulders, and upper body isolations. Sadie's cuing has always been really very good. She breaks down moves while giving you warnings and safety tips, drills them while telling you how to use your muscles and improve the move - and all the while she never loses track of the counts.Again, as is typical, we go on to hip movements next. Sadie transitions from one to the next very smoothly even when each set of movements is n its own section, accessible from the main menu. The music is varied and quite nice, not boring you with a repeated loop or a single song. This is nice and thoughtfully done because it gets the learner accustomed to dancing to different styles of music from the start.We go on from hip basics to undulations and variations on them with just enough repetitions to drill them without wearing out your back. And then there's an introduction to a basic shimmy. I've seen shimmy sessions I feel more comfortable with, but it'll do.Graduating to traveling steps, we combine hip movements and footwork in more drills - with warnings about not hyper-extending knees. We spend a long while on forward and back stepping with hip hits and hip downs - a tough move by any standards. There are some Egyptian variations on these moves in another section. And finally a bunch of turns, traveling circles steps, with layering.Learning how to learn choreography is a skill in itself, so I's a good thing we have a chunk of choreo to work with here. It's in three parts or three combos and it isn't enough to span a song, but you do put into action what you learnt in the technique sections and the combinations are something easily usable elsewhere in future.This a video that I believe is really packed with content and really gives you value for money. There is no rushing through anything, no skimping on advice and warnings. It's just solid instruction.I do get review copies of DVDs, but this isn't one of them.",5,Basic technique for the determined belly dancer,1341446400,"07 5, 2012",2012,3405,"['years', 'learning', 'amazing', 'art', 'belly', 'dancing', 'finding', 'beginner', 'over', 'again', 'now', 'then', ""'ve"", 'come', 'basic', 'instructional', 'videos', 'flavors', 'are', 'are', 'created', 'belief', 'point', 'right', 'beginning', 'making', 'hard', 'work', 'fun', 'are', 'others', 'are', 'made', 'focus', 'building', 'foundations', 'are', 'totally', 'flawless', 'leaving', 'fun', 'up', 'learner', 'course', 'are', 'also', 'strike', 'balance', 'two.So', 'Sadie', 'instructional', 'videos', 'tip', 'hard', 'work', 'category', ""'re"", 'not', 'someone', 'who', 'go', 'video', 'few', 'times', 'sass', 'up', 'dance', 'floor', 'Saturday', 'beginner', 'DVD', 'technique', 'also', 'very', 'comprehensive', 'going', 'simple', 'hip', 'swings', 'way', 'traveling', 'steps', 'mini', 'choreography', 'would', ""n't"", 'be', 'wrong', 'describe', 'whole', 'course', 'taught', 'expertise', 'focus', 'not', 'much', 'fooling', 'around', 'not', 'too', 'many', 'light', 'moments', 'people', 'want', 'just', 'fact', 'was', 'looking', 'something', 'refresh', 'basics', 'wasting', 'time', 'chatting', 'cheerleading', 'found', 'good', 'option', 'Sadie', 'talks', 'explains', 'making', 'do', 'moves', 'need', 'stand', 'around', 'wait', 'long', 'explanations', 'be', 'section', 'posture.A', 'short', 'warm-up', 'stretches', 'kicks', 'video', 'usual', 'belly', 'dance', 'basics', 'then', 'go', 'arms', 'shoulders', 'upper', 'body', 'isolations', 'Sadie', 'cuing', 'always', 'been', 'really', 'very', 'good', 'breaks', 'down', 'moves', 'giving', 'warnings', 'safety', 'tips', 'telling', 'how', 'use', 'muscles', 'improve', 'move', 'never', 'track', 'counts.Again', 'typical', 'go', 'hip', 'movements', 'Sadie', 'transitions', 'one', 'next', 'very', 'smoothly', 'even', 'when', 'set', 'movements', 'n', 'own', 'section', 'accessible', 'main', 'menu', 'music', 'varied', 'quite', 'nice', 'not', 'boring', 'repeated', 'loop', 'single', 'song', 'nice', 'thoughtfully', 'done', 'learner', 'accustomed', 'dancing', 'different', 'styles', 'music', 'start.We', 'go', 'hip', 'basics', 'undulations', 'variations', 'just', 'enough', 'repetitions', 'drill', 'wearing', 'out', 'back', 'then', 'introduction', 'basic', 'shimmy', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'shimmy', 'sessions', 'feel', 'more', 'comfortable', ""'ll"", 'do.Graduating', 'traveling', 'steps', 'combine', 'hip', 'movements', 'footwork', 'more', 'drills', 'warnings', 'not', 'hyper-extending', 'knees', 'spend', 'long', 'while', 'forward', 'back', 'stepping', 'hip', 'hits', 'hip', 'downs', 'tough', 'move', 'standards', 'are', 'Egyptian', 'variations', 'moves', 'section', 'finally', 'bunch', 'turns', 'traveling', 'circles', 'steps', 'layering.Learning', 'how', 'learn', 'choreography', 'skill', 'good', 'thing', 'have', 'chunk', 'choreo', 'work', 'here', 'three', 'parts', 'three', 'combos', ""n't"", 'enough', 'span', 'song', 'do', 'put', 'action', 'what', 'learnt', 'technique', 'sections', 'combinations', 'are', 'something', 'easily', 'usable', 'elsewhere', 'future.This', 'video', 'believe', 'really', 'packed', 'content', 'really', 'value', 'money', 'rushing', 'anything', 'skimping', 'advice', 'warnings', 'just', 'solid', 'instruction.I', 'do', 'get', 'review', 'copies', 'DVDs', ""n't"", 'one']",Sadie's Complete Bellydance Guide

1226871,A3VJZ9LPU4SF3Q,B001PBK6K2,"Gr33n4blu3 ""La leche se arde.""","[20, 57]","I was confused by this movie.  The plot was paper thin and it seemed to focus just on belly dancing.  There was no story to speak of, and the cinematography was one dimensional.  There wasn't a lot of music variety either.  But the central character and her struggle through an oppressive regime was truly inspiring.  Sadie (which is the name of one of my cats incidentally - one of two Siberians.  The other's name is Sergei) won me over by her charming personality and her rhythmic hip motions....ahem....  Viva la revolution!About 10 minutes into the film I realized that it might be beneficial to actually get off the couch and start trying some of the moves Sadie was exhibiting.  BIG MISTAKE.  I guess I missed the warm up...I gotta tell ya, this movie is not for beginners (or should I say beginner beginners - shlubs like me who make an art out of couch aerobics).  Unfortunately, perhaps resulting from my recent underwear purchase, I *thought* that Belly Dancing was easy.  I thought, ""I gots me a belly, and I can movie my hips, why should this be hard?""  You never see a belly dancer really sweaty right?  Not in any movie I've ever seen.  WRONG.Apparently you have to ""undulate"" to a beat and do it semi-rapidly.  This fact should not be understated.  I can't carry a tune with a bucket, much less move with anything approaching a rhythm.  By the time I got to a slight break (a discussion on posture) I was sweating like a pig on an August day - and I looked like that very pig twisting and writhing in front of my mirror.  Nothing like Sadie.  Nothing at all...Also, as a person unaccustomed to any form of exercise, save the rigors of sloth-dom, I could barely move the next day.  My coworkers asked me why I was wobbling around like a cripple.  It's not to manly to say, ""I did a grueling 25 minute belly dancing workout, you know, after my power squats and bench presses"" and yes, I had to take a breather after 25 minutes.  It was either that or start crying.I chose the more dignified option.

I wish she had included the choreography to it.Sadie is not the belly dancer to be played with she knows her stuff and she wants you to know it as well.Sadie is a very technical teacher as well. She is teaching you the mechanics of what you are doing, she even shows what you should not be doing. Go figure she herself is a very technical dancer. She really breaks down the movement and you can see everything she is doing.There are no weird camera angles.The Menu is broken down in an easy way to get what you want, no need to go through the whole DVD to get to one section.The choreography is a  three part short choreography but you do use a lot of what you learned.She even uses a variety of arm and hand placement. Even the little that she uses is a step up. I have a couple of her DVD's and she is not a fan of hand and arm movements.I recommend this DVD for everyone, even advanced students need to constantly drill the basic. The content is outstanding. This is a very thorough technique DVD. Some of her concepts are nice. Like when she did the upper body movement in something like a sumu squat. Her constant reminders about posture throughout the DVD is wonderful.The about me section is just a brief written review about her.The first reviewer pretty much covered everything,there really isn't to much to say but this DVD is worth the money.To me the magic in this DVD comes from drilling the basics with correct posture. That is when you start to see the Sadie style execution and it can be something that is easily overlooked. Are your knee's bent the entire time? Does your pelvic stay tucked under for all the movements? Sadie stays bent knees for the majority of her movements ,and her pelvic always stays tucked unless doing an interior hip circle. It takes work to transition through movements staying in the correct posture. If you like Sadie style and plan on using her more advanced DVD'S or if you have her more advanced DVD's but struggle. This would be the perfect DVD to get.Doing this DVD with awareness will really take you along way.With that said I usually skip her arms section and drill that with another DVD. Her shimmy section can be troublesome. The shimmy that she does on here looks more like a freeze shimmy as opposed to the bent knee shimmy or the Egyptian shimmy.Not a problem but you may not be drilling the shimmy you want to drill.",5,Yes,1237593600,"03 21, 2009",2009,2464,"['First', 'off', 'let', 'say', 'bonus', 'performance', 'was', 'DVD', 'alone.Absolutely', 'wonderful', 'wish', 'had', 'included', 'choreography', 'it.Sadie', 'not', 'belly', 'dancer', 'be', 'played', 'stuff', 'know', 'well.Sadie', 'very', 'technical', 'teacher', 'as', 'well', 'teaching', 'mechanics', 'what', 'are', 'doing', 'even', 'what', 'should', 'not', 'be', 'doing', 'Go', 'figure', 'very', 'technical', 'dancer', 'really', 'down', 'movement', 'can', 'see', 'everything', 'doing.There', 'are', 'weird', 'camera', 'angles.The', 'Menu', 'broken', 'down', 'easy', 'way', 'get', 'what', 'want', 'need', 'go', 'whole', 'DVD', 'get', 'one', 'section.The', 'choreography', 'three', 'part', 'short', 'choreography', 'do', 'use', 'lot', 'what', 'learned.She', 'even', 'variety', 'arm', 'hand', 'placement', 'Even', 'little', 'step', 'up', 'have', 'couple', 'DVD', 'not', 'fan', 'hand', 'arm', 'movements.I', 'recommend', 'DVD', 'everyone', 'even', 'advanced', 'students', 'need', 'constantly', 'drill', 'basic', 'content', 'outstanding', 'very', 'thorough', 'technique', 'DVD', 'concepts', 'are', 'nice', 'when', 'did', 'upper', 'body', 'movement', 'something', 'sumu', 'squat', 'constant', 'reminders', 'posture', 'DVD', 'wonderful.The', 'section', 'just', 'brief', 'written', 'review', 'her.The', 'first', 'reviewer', 'pretty', 'much', 'covered', 'everything', 'really', ""n't"", 'much', 'say', 'DVD', 'money.To', 'magic', 'DVD', 'drilling', 'basics', 'correct', 'posture', 'when', 'start', 'see', 'Sadie', 'style', 'execution', 'can', 'be', 'something', 'easily', 'overlooked', 'Are', 'knee', 'bent', 'entire', 'time', 'pelvic', 'stay', 'tucked', 'movements', 'Sadie', 'bent', 'knees', 'majority', 'movements', 'pelvic', 'always', 'tucked', 'doing', 'interior', 'hip', 'circle', 'work', 'transition', 'movements', 'staying', 'correct', 'posture', 'like', 'Sadie', 'style', 'plan', 'using', 'more', 'advanced', 'DVD', 'have', 'more', 'advanced', 'DVD', 'struggle', 'would', 'be', 'perfect', 'DVD', 'get.Doing', 'DVD', 'awareness', 'will', 'really', 'take', 'along', 'way.With', 'said', 'usually', 'skip', 'arms', 'section', 'drill', 'DVD', 'shimmy', 'section', 'can', 'be', 'troublesome', 'shimmy', 'here', 'more', 'freeze', 'shimmy', 'opposed', 'bent', 'knee', 'shimmy', 'Egyptian', 'shimmy.Not', 'problem', 'may', 'not', 'be', 'drilling', 'shimmy', 'want', 'drill']",Sadie's Complete Bellydance Guide

Nice astmosphere. Music fits the moves that she is teaching. The warm up is a drill of basic moves with no muscle isolations. It is a nice length in itself. The whole Dvd is a lot of drilling. For instance I counted how many times she did the figure's 8's(56 counts that is left right= 1 count) that was slow, then she speeds it up another 50 plus counts then she slow is down again for maybe another 30. each technigue is drilled.the shimmy's for any one who has not mastered it here is your chance. she starts off with slow hip movements 60 left 1,right 2 counts she speeds it up a knotch maybe 1-2 more times and each level of speed you are doing the move for about 30-50 counts before she gets to the fast shimmy which she keeps you there for a nice while holding the tempo. by the time you get to the actual shimmy you may be hipped out. I got it now and can hold it.The egyption variations are traveling moves she calls arabic 1,2,and 3.  You do undulations, shimmy;s and other traveling moves on rela've as well. There is one move she did that had my hip burning and I was glad she switched to the other side.The undulations variations is going from a upper undualtion to a lower undulation in one move. I looked at but have not practiced the traveling hip circles combinations and layering variations yet.She mentions that many of the moves are not basic moves but she figure now is a good time to learn them. She makes you want to master the technigues. She makes you maintain proper form throughout the dvd. She mentioned also that she designed this dvd to equal an eight week course.She expresses that it is very important to practice as much as you can to train your muscle memory and it is important to stregnthen the muscles. It is a lot on this dvd and for the price you can't beat it at all. I would have paid more for it. I actually paid more than you will if you get it from amazon. If you are looking for a good dvd to get you started and want to learn muscle isolation like Sadie you are in for a treat.I don't give too many reviews but many has helped me not waist my money espcially the one's who do the video clips. I also would like to mention that rather or not something is beginner's or not depends on the person. If you have a dance background like salsa, african and can do the moves in dirty dancing or have taken folk dancing and line dancing many of the same moves are implicated just maybe done slightly different. the two step and three step and the grape vine I learned in a gym class under folk dancing along with other variations that I do not see but plan to use in my own dance style. You will catch on to the moves very easy if you have a dance back ground even if you have never belly danced because you have some dicipline alreay. If you work out doing yoga or pilates muscle isoalations will be easier because you have alrealy learned to control your internal muscles. Your dance style also makes a differnce. if you are a stiff person vs a flexable person who you learn from may make a difference. There are some dvd's that had a lot of good stuff in them but they moved too slow for I got bored. I like it when you keep moving. If you start talking a lot with no movement I will loose interest and never get through the dvd.

I had not seen all of them in any of my other BD DVD's, although Jenna covers most of them, without naming them specifically.It's a pity I did not buy this earlier in my ""introduction"" to bellydance, since this DVD is excellent for drilling basic bellydance moves. Maybe I will still use it sometimes to really get the moves into my muscle memory and to master the hip drop on the down and all the Arabic walks and turns; in fact, it does not matter which level you are, you can never have enough drilling of the basic moves. If you would like to drill a bit more advanced material I recommendModern Tribal Belly Dance, with Asharah: Beginner tribal fusion bellydance how-to, Belly dancing instruction,Contemporary Belly Dance and Yoga, with Ariellah: Tribal fusion bellydance classes, Belly dance fitness, workout, and yoga instruction, Beginner-intermediate,Serpentine: Bellydance with Rachel Brice (TWO-DVD SET): Complete belly dancing instructional program, Belly dancing classes with yoga, How-to in Rachel's tribal style belly dance, including full choreographies(best shimmy layering section in my collection) andBellydance Pop & Lock - Tribal Fusion Hip-Hop with Elisheva: Belly dancing classes, Tribal fusion belly dance instruction, Hip-hop belly dance fusion how-to, which drills a lot of layered movements (maybe as good as Rachel's in terms of shimmy layering).Personally I think Asharah's drills (and her tough conditioning section) helped me improve very fast and when I used this DVD, it seemed fairly easy with some exceptions; but I had a tough time with Asharah. Maybe it's better to start with something easier but still very intense in terms of time dedicated to each drill like this one and then move up. Asharah increases the tempo more and makes more ""punctuated"" and sharp moves. If I could only get one drilling DVD, I would probably get Asharah's (because you get more fitness benefits and muscle control from it, and my main goal when I started BD and other dance DVDs was to get some exercise but in a fun way), but it really depends on your goals and on which level you already are. If you are starting bellydance, then this DVD will definitely help you drill and get the moves. On the other hand, if your goal is ethereal beauty and artistry you might get more out of Ariellah's DVD. The styles are also different, Ariellah and Asharah are gothic (or at least something like modern industrial) while Sadie is more oriental style.In this DVD I missed Sadie's tummy rolls (she only mentions them, but does not include them in the drills), pops and accents, as well as layering, so although it says ""Complete Bellydance Guide"", it's more a ""Complete Basic Bellydance Drills DVD"". I was expecting more ""flashy"" combinations in the choreography so I was a bit dissapointed. I think I need to get one of Sadie & Kaya's DVD's or one of Sadie's Drum solos to get something of her signature style. So although this is one of the best drilling DVD's I have seen in terms of variety of basic moves and variations to those moves, as well as in terms of length dedicated to drill each move, I don't really ""love"" the DVD.CARDIO CHALLENGE: Low TONING: Medium CHOREOGRAPHY DIFFICULTY: Beginner DRILLS: Very good for beginners; easy in terms of layering INSTRUCTIONAL QUALITY: Excellent MUSIC: Very good FUN FACTOR: Medium - It's drilling, so it's not really for fun, but it is not boring either, because of the very good music.CONTENT:1) Warm-up. It is very lengthy and it's drilling from the start. In fact it consists mainly of bellydance isolation drills (except for a very few stretches at the beginning) and it is even divided into sections like ""upper body isolations"" and ""hip isolations"". It is hard to distinguish between the warm up and the technique sections even in the menu. The difference is that in the warm up you just repeat the isolations to get the muscles that are going to be used warmed-up, without caring too much about technique, whereas in the technique sections Sadie emphasizes which muscles you need to engage and she introduces some rhythm variations and travelling.2) Technique section. It consists of several sections where you drill extensively almost everything (basic shimmy, horizontal figure 8's, vertical figure 8's up and down, also called ""taxeem"" and ""mayas"", full body undulations and some footwork).3) Choreography. It consists of 3 segments containing four 8-counts each. The choreography is beginner level, so it's perfectly doable with some practise (unlike many other choreos included in BD DVD's), because it has little layering, almost no accents, the arms are used mainly to frame the body and the footwork is not complicated. Maybe the most difficult moves are the arabic turns. The choreography has not really impressed me nor does it contain any signature move; it is not fun either like the practise flows included by Jenna inBelly Dance Basics & Beyond, with Jenna: Belly Dancing Classes for a Solid Foundation - Bellydance how-to, belly dance technique. I think the choreo was aimed at getting you more practise with the moves and how to transition between them; so not really made for fun or aesthetics, but to continue the drilling but in a sequence of moves.4) PerformanceMUSIC: Excellent instrumental oriental music, but the sound of the music is a bit low compared to Sadie's voice, so you cannot really ""submerge"" into the music and hear Sadie's recommendations as a background. The main focus is Sadie's voice with a background music so if you want to enjoy the music you will have Sadie shouting at you.EMPHASIS:Drilling & drilling the basic bellydance moves",4,"This DVD is a

I have tried two other beginner belly dance DVDs (Amira's Belly Dance 101 and Belly Dance for Beginners with Leila of Cairo.) Out of the three, I think this one is the best and I have definitely gotten the most from it. I won't spend time breaking down the DVD because it has already been done so extensively by other reviewers. For me, this DVD has been useful in drilling a lot of the basic moves. The warm-up is pretty long and thorough. The overall set-up of the DVD is very organized and well-planned out. The breakdown of each individual move is precise, with plenty of tips, tricks, and friendly reminders. Sadie, as an instructor, is straightforward and down to business. She doesn't waste time by pausing and talking like other instructors; she is able to move and talk at the same time, keeping you actively engaged.I have now just reached a point where I can work through this DVD in its entirety; not only is it long, but it will make you work. I have lost weight by working with this DVD, and I've noticed a considerable difference in my legs, thighs, arms, shoulders, and abdomen. Personally, I think this video is better suited for people who are serious about leaning how to belly dance. There is a lot of drilling, which might not be appealing to someone who is looking for a fun, upbeat dance workout. I will definitely continue to work with this DVD in the future, but I might limit my usage of it to once a week or when I feel like I need to refresh/drill the basics.",5,Good for drilling basics,1404518400,"07 5, 2014",2014,1533,"['have', 'been', 'belly', 'dancing', 'two', 'months', 'now', 'have', 'tried', 'two', 'other', 'beginner', 'belly', 'dance', 'DVDs', 'Amira', 'Belly', 'Dance', '101', 'Belly', 'Dance', 'Beginners', 'Leila', 'Cairo', 'three', 'think', 'one', 'best', 'have', 'definitely', 'gotten', 'most', 'wo', ""n't"", 'spend', 'time', 'breaking', 'down', 'DVD', 'already', 'been', 'done', 'so', 'extensively', 'other', 'reviewers', 'DVD', 'been', 'useful', 'drilling', 'lot', 'basic', 'moves', 'warm-up', 'pretty', 'long', 'thorough', 'overall', 'set-up', 'DVD', 'very', 'organized', 'well-planned', 'out', 'breakdown', 'individual', 'move', 'precise', 'plenty', 'tips', 'tricks', 'friendly', 'reminders', 'Sadie', 'instructor', 'straightforward', 'down', 'business', ""n't"", 'waste', 'time', 'pausing', 'talking', 'other', 'instructors', 'able', 'move', 'talk', 'same', 'time', 'keeping', 'actively', 'engaged.I', 'have', 'now', 'just', 'reached', 'point', 'where', 'can', 'work', 'DVD', 'entirety', 'not', 'only', 'long', 'will', 'make', 'work', 'have', 'lost', 'weight', 'working', 'DVD', ""'ve"", 'noticed', 'considerable', 'difference', 'legs', 'thighs', 'arms', 'shoulders', 'abdomen', 'Personally', 'think', 'video', 'better', 'suited', 'people', 'who', 'are', 'serious', 'leaning', 'how', 'belly', 'dance', 'lot', 'drilling', 'might', 'not', 'be', 'appealing', 'someone', 'who', 'looking', 'fun', 'upbeat', 'dance', 'workout', 'will', 'definitely', 'continue', 'work', 'DVD', 'future', 'might', 'limit', 'usage', 'once', 'week', 'when', 'feel', 'need', 'refresh/drill', 'basics']",Sadie's Complete Bellydance Guide
