1146331,A3EE0H0NWQ9QVL,B0014DZ2WS,"&#34;Rocky Raccoon&#34; ""Hey, Doc, It's Only ...","[5, 10]","Seldom do students get more excited than when a fight breaks out at school.  Add to that the list of extreme sports and, especially, the addition of kickboxing to mainstream audiences, and you've got a sure-fire way to capture and keep the shortest attention spans for a movie.It is on this premise that I felt an inclination to dock 'Never Back Down'.  The sense of pervasive violence with a sport I don't particularly like led to this belief, but I don't like to do that.  A movie should be judged by its cinematic merits rather than its subject matter.  Don't get me wrong; I like contact sports.  It's just that I enjoy the finesse of hockey, football, and boxing far better.  Throw in the kicking element, and I honestly thought this movie a was bloodthirsty medium for voyeuristic violence.I decided to back up and look at the merits and demerits of the feature and let others' decide if they like the venue.  As a film, the kickboxing seems just about the only new thing going for it.  There's Jake Tyler (Sean Faris), the protagonist, a kid who moves from Iowa to Orlando.  (One kid calls him ""Kurt Cobain"" for his inclination to wear flannel in Florida.)  As the new kid in town, he faces a kickboxing bully, Ryan McCarthy (Cam Gigandet) who enjoys testing any newcomers setting foot on his turf.  Between both figures is Ryan's girlfriend, Baja Miller (Amber Heard) who has the good sense to dislike her boyfriend's sadistic past time.Ryan has a hard time leaving his baggage behind him.  His father recently passed away, and we get some fuzzy flashbacks about an accident we learn more about later on.  His mother (Leslie Hope) is severe with him, but it's not hard to understand why with her son's frequent brawls out on the football field.  Because of the pervasiveness of ""You Tube,"" his past feisty football seasons are soon scrutinized by a new student body.Neatly, an infatuated Baja invites him to the same party that Ryan attends.  All bikini clad girls greet the boys by the Jacuzzi until they all find something they all admit they find more exciting: a gladiator adventure in kickboxing.  Egged on by the perpetually smirky and smiling Ryan, we get a nasty fight with one participant all but unfamiliar with the methods or madness of this martial arts-boxing hybrid.To ensure a level of decency, Ryan's new best friend, Max (Evan Peters) introduces him to the studio of famous Confucius teacher master, Jean Roqua (Djimon Hounsou), the karate kid of kickboxing who warns Ryan that if he gets in a fight outside the gym, he's out for good.  There has to be some honor in the proceedings, or the film won't work properly.And, I'll bet you can guess whether or not he keeps his promise.  Besides some predictability, Chris Hautz's screenplay makes all the participants sound like kids, but does little else.  Not every teen movie has to be `Juno (Single-Disc Edition),' but the dialogue has too much small talk and too little to inspire.  There's more than a few clich&eacute;s found here.The very best thing about `Never Back Down' is former Oscar nominee, Djimon Hounsou, whom we must laud for taking this film out of the gutter, while regretting his departure from movies like `Blood Diamond (Full Screen Edition)'.  The second best aspect of the movie, unfortunately, is the fighting scenes.  Well shot with expert lighting and angles, director Jeff Wadlan captures all the blood, sweat, and tears of every encounter.  Don't expect this to be the `Rocky' or `Raging Bull' of  kickboxing, but at least it has more energy than the more decent, but lackluster recent effort `Redbelt'.  It doesn't help that the characters aren't often likable.  We can appreciate Jake Tyler's lot in life without finding much charisma in his character.  Don't kids deserve better than this?At the beginning of the movie, Wadlan touts his new movie version features ""more bone crushing"" sounds.  Now if that's his heralded achievement for this feature DVD, count me as one heading toward the exit.A J.P.'s Pan 2*'s = Mediocre",2,"Kickboxing:  ""All the Rage""",1221436800,"09 15, 2008",2008,4027,"['Seldom', 'do', 'students', 'get', 'more', 'excited', 'when', 'fight', 'out', 'school', 'Add', 'list', 'extreme', 'sports', 'especially', 'addition', 'kickboxing', 'mainstream', 'audiences', ""'ve"", 'got', 'sure-fire', 'way', 'capture', 'keep', 'shortest', 'attention', 'spans', 'movie.It', 'premise', 'felt', 'inclination', 'dock', 'Back', 'Down', 'sense', 'pervasive', 'violence', 'sport', 'do', ""n't"", 'particularly', 'like', 'led', 'belief', 'do', ""n't"", 'like', 'do', 'movie', 'should', 'be', 'judged', 'cinematic', 'merits', 'rather', 'subject', 'matter', 'Do', ""n't"", 'get', 'wrong', 'like', 'contact', 'sports', 'just', 'enjoy', 'finesse', 'hockey', 'football', 'boxing', 'far', 'better', 'Throw', 'kicking', 'element', 'honestly', 'thought', 'movie', 'was', 'bloodthirsty', 'medium', 'voyeuristic', 'violence.I', 'decided', 'back', 'up', 'look', 'merits', 'demerits', 'feature', 'let', 'others', 'decide', 'like', 'venue', 'film', 'kickboxing', 'just', 'only', 'new', 'thing', 'going', 'Jake', 'Tyler', 'Sean', 'Faris', 'protagonist', 'kid', 'who', 'Iowa', 'Orlando', 'One', 'kid', 'Kurt', 'Cobain', 'inclination', 'wear', 'flannel', 'Florida', 'new', 'kid', 'town', 'kickboxing', 'bully', 'Ryan', 'McCarthy', 'Cam', 'Gigandet', 'who', 'testing', 'newcomers', 'setting', 'foot', 'turf', 'Between', 'figures', 'Ryan', 'girlfriend', 'Baja', 'Miller', 'Amber', 'Heard', 'who', 'good', 'sense', 'dislike', 'boyfriend', 'sadistic', 'past', 'time.Ryan', 'hard', 'time', 'leaving', 'baggage', 'father', 'recently', 'passed', 'away', 'get', 'fuzzy', 'flashbacks', 'accident', 'learn', 'more', 'about', 'later', 'mother', 'Leslie', 'Hope', 'severe', 'not', 'hard', 'understand', 'why', 'son', 'frequent', 'out', 'football', 'field', 'pervasiveness', 'Tube', 'past', 'feisty', 'football', 'seasons', 'are', 'soon', 'scrutinized', 'new', 'student', 'body.Neatly', 'infatuated', 'Baja', 'same', 'party', 'Ryan', 'bikini', 'clad', 'girls', 'greet', 'boys', 'Jacuzzi', 'find', 'something', 'admit', 'find', 'more', 'exciting', 'gladiator', 'adventure', 'kickboxing', 'Egged', 'perpetually', 'smirky', 'smiling', 'Ryan', 'get', 'nasty', 'fight', 'one', 'participant', 'unfamiliar', 'methods', 'madness', 'martial', 'arts-boxing', 'hybrid.To', 'ensure', 'level', 'decency', 'Ryan', 'new', 'best', 'friend', 'Max', 'Evan', 'Peters', 'studio', 'famous', 'Confucius', 'teacher', 'master', 'Jean', 'Roqua', 'Djimon', 'Hounsou', 'karate', 'kid', 'kickboxing', 'who', 'Ryan', 'fight', 'gym', 'out', 'good', 'be', 'honor', 'proceedings', 'film', 'wo', ""n't"", 'work', 'properly.And', ""'ll"", 'bet', 'can', 'guess', 'not', 'promise', 'predictability', 'Chris', 'Hautz', 'screenplay', 'participants', 'sound', 'kids', 'little', 'else', 'Not', 'teen', 'movie', 'be', 'Juno', 'Single-Disc', 'Edition', 'dialogue', 'too', 'much', 'small', 'talk', 'too', 'little', 'inspire', 'more', 'few', 'clich', 'eacute', 'found', 'here.The', 'very', 'best', 'thing', 'Never', 'Back', 'Down', 'former', 'Oscar', 'nominee', 'Djimon', 'Hounsou', 'whom', 'must', 'laud', 'taking', 'film', 'gutter', 'regretting', 'departure', 'movies', 'Blood', 'Diamond', 'Full', 'Screen', 'Edition', 'second', 'best', 'aspect', 'movie', 'unfortunately', 'fighting', 'scenes', 'Well', 'shot', 'expert', 'lighting', 'angles', 'director', 'Jeff', 'Wadlan', 'blood', 'sweat', 'tears', 'encounter', 'Do', ""n't"", 'expect', 'be', 'Rocky', 'Raging', 'Bull', ""'"", 'kickboxing', 'least', 'more', 'energy', 'more', 'decent', 'lackluster', 'recent', 'effort', 'Redbelt', ""n't"", 'help', 'characters', 'are', ""n't"", 'often', 'likable', 'can', 'appreciate', 'Jake', 'Tyler', 'lot', 'life', 'finding', 'much', 'charisma', 'character', 'Do', ""n't"", 'kids', 'deserve', 'better', 'beginning', 'movie', 'Wadlan', 'new', 'movie', 'version', 'more', 'bone', 'crushing', 'sounds', 'Now', 'heralded', 'achievement', 'feature', 'DVD', 'count', 'one', 'heading', 'exit.A', 'J.P.', 'Pan', '2*', '=', 'Mediocre']",Never Back Down

1146335,A3MQQS40FK2QAQ,B0014DZ2WS,"Bradford P. Ruhle ""Brad Ruhle""","[2, 6]","It becomes completely obvious that NEVER BACK DOWN is a rip off of THE KARATE KID. I've seen the KARATE KID formula done in better movies like SIDEKICKS, which benefited with not only the presence of Chuck Norris, but also because it tried to add elements of THE SECRET LIFE OF WALTER MITTY and added comic satire of Norris' famous films. NEVER BACK DOWN not only rips off THE KARATE KID, it has a lot of problems with the MMA fight scenes, which I'll get to later.Let's click off the obvious stuff from THE KARATE KID: Boy without a father (Sean Faris) moves  to a new place with his mother. He gets the attention of the prettiest girl in the high school, but gains an enemy in a student who is an MMA champion (Cam Gigandet), and the girl's boyfriend. Boy gets beaten brutally in front of his classmates. He turns to a mysterious MMA instructor (Djimon Hounsou)with a terrible secret. Instructor teaches him how to fight and how to avoid one. Instructor's terrible secret is revealed, and everything leads up to the big showdown between the boy and the MMA champion. Sound unbelievably familiar? Anyone who has seen the original KARATE KID (or the 2010 remake which is actually really good) will recognize this. The rip off is so obvious I would not be surprised if the actors knew it from day one.Now, about the MMA fight scenes. Sean Faris and Cam Gigandet look to be rather scrawny for a couple of MMA fighters, especially Gigandet. Sure, they got great physiques but they just seem too lightweight for even the UFC featherweight division. Most of the real MMA fighters I've seen are kind of chubby in the middle. I can also tell that the kicking techniques used by these actors (once again, especially for Gigandet), are not the techniques used in this kind of competition. Gigandet uses Tae Kwon Doe kicks that any real MMA fighter would see telegraphed a mile away. (Believe me, I've seen real MMA competition. Most of the time they don't even do kicks; they use grappling styles.) I used to train in Tae Kwon Doe, so I can recognize this martial art in a second at the movies.I know, I know. NEVER BACK DOWN is not intended to be a realistic depiction of MMA. I don't require total realism in martial arts movies. (I actually enjoy the Hong Kong Kung Fu movies like IRON MONKEY and CROUCHING TIGER, HIDDEN DRAGON.) But NEVER BACK DOWN is supposed to be the first Hollywood film that focuses on this international phenomenon known as Mixed Martial Arts fighting. Couldn't they have done something a little more original than ripping off THE KARATE KID? (They could've called it THE MMA KID, although that wouldn't have worked, either.) And somebody tell me that whoever choreographed the fight scenes is someone who actually trains MMA fighters. If that's the case, he better go back to his day job. Another film that features real MMA fighters: CRADLE TO THE GRAVE has a fight scene between them and Jet Li. It isn't all that realistic either, but at least the MMA fighters were using the actual techniques they use in the ring.Is there anything good in this movie? Yes. Djimon Hounsou is a terrific actor, and it is a pleasure in watching all of his scenes in the movie. He has an excellent line that describes his MMA school: ""Kids come in here with a lot of anger, and they leave with a little bit less of it."" That's the feeling I've had after a night of Tae Kwon Doe sparring classes.",2,Karate Kid rip off with unrealistic fighting,1291593600,"12 6, 2010",2010,3398,"['completely', 'obvious', 'NEVER', 'BACK', 'DOWN', 'rip', 'THE', 'KARATE', 'KID', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'KARATE', 'KID', 'formula', 'done', 'better', 'movies', 'SIDEKICKS', 'benefited', 'not', 'only', 'presence', 'Chuck', 'Norris', 'also', 'tried', 'add', 'elements', 'THE', 'SECRET', 'LIFE', 'OF', 'WALTER', 'MITTY', 'added', 'comic', 'satire', 'Norris', 'famous', 'films', 'NEVER', 'BACK', 'DOWN', 'not', 'only', 'KARATE', 'KID', 'lot', 'problems', 'MMA', 'fight', 'scenes', ""'ll"", 'get', 'later.Let', 'click', 'obvious', 'stuff', 'THE', 'KARATE', 'KID', 'Boy', 'father', 'Sean', 'Faris', 'new', 'place', 'mother', 'attention', 'prettiest', 'girl', 'high', 'school', 'gains', 'enemy', 'student', 'who', 'MMA', 'champion', 'Cam', 'Gigandet', 'girl', 'boyfriend', 'Boy', 'beaten', 'brutally', 'front', 'classmates', 'mysterious', 'MMA', 'instructor', 'Djimon', 'Hounsou', 'terrible', 'secret', 'Instructor', 'how', 'fight', 'how', 'avoid', 'one', 'Instructor', 'terrible', 'secret', 'revealed', 'everything', 'up', 'big', 'showdown', 'boy', 'MMA', 'champion', 'Sound', 'unbelievably', 'familiar', 'Anyone', 'who', 'seen', 'original', 'KARATE', 'KID', '2010', 'remake', 'actually', 'really', 'good', 'will', 'recognize', 'rip', 'off', 'so', 'obvious', 'would', 'not', 'be', 'surprised', 'actors', 'knew', 'day', 'one.Now', 'MMA', 'fight', 'scenes', 'Sean', 'Faris', 'Cam', 'Gigandet', 'look', 'be', 'rather', 'scrawny', 'couple', 'MMA', 'fighters', 'especially', 'Gigandet', 'Sure', 'got', 'great', 'physiques', 'just', 'seem', 'too', 'lightweight', 'even', 'UFC', 'featherweight', 'division', 'Most', 'real', 'MMA', 'fighters', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'are', 'kind', 'chubby', 'middle', 'can', 'also', 'tell', 'kicking', 'techniques', 'used', 'actors', 'once', 'again', 'especially', 'Gigandet', 'are', 'not', 'techniques', 'used', 'kind', 'competition', 'Gigandet', 'Tae', 'Kwon', 'Doe', 'real', 'MMA', 'fighter', 'would', 'see', 'telegraphed', 'mile', 'away', 'Believe', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'real', 'MMA', 'competition', 'Most', 'time', 'do', ""n't"", 'even', 'do', 'kicks', 'use', 'grappling', 'styles', 'used', 'train', 'Tae', 'Kwon', 'Doe', 'can', 'recognize', 'martial', 'art', 'second', 'movies.I', 'know', 'know', 'NEVER', 'BACK', 'DOWN', 'not', 'intended', 'be', 'realistic', 'depiction', 'MMA', 'do', ""n't"", 'require', 'total', 'realism', 'martial', 'arts', 'movies', 'actually', 'enjoy', 'Hong', 'Kong', 'Kung', 'Fu', 'movies', 'IRON', 'MONKEY', 'CROUCHING', 'TIGER', 'HIDDEN', 'DRAGON', 'NEVER', 'BACK', 'DOWN', 'supposed', 'be', 'first', 'Hollywood', 'film', 'international', 'phenomenon', 'known', 'Mixed', 'Martial', 'Arts', 'fighting', 'Could', ""n't"", 'have', 'done', 'something', 'little', 'more', 'original', 'ripping', 'off', 'KARATE', 'KID', 'could', ""'ve"", 'called', 'THE', 'MMA', 'KID', 'would', ""n't"", 'have', 'worked', 'either', 'somebody', 'tell', 'whoever', 'choreographed', 'fight', 'scenes', 'someone', 'who', 'actually', 'MMA', 'fighters', 'case', 'better', 'go', 'back', 'day', 'job', 'film', 'real', 'MMA', 'fighters', 'CRADLE', 'THE', 'GRAVE', 'fight', 'scene', 'Jet', 'Li', ""n't"", 'realistic', 'least', 'MMA', 'fighters', 'were', 'using', 'actual', 'techniques', 'use', 'ring.Is', 'there', 'anything', 'good', 'movie', 'Yes', 'Djimon', 'Hounsou', 'terrific', 'actor', 'pleasure', 'watching', 'scenes', 'movie', 'excellent', 'line', 'MMA', 'school', 'Kids', 'come', 'here', 'lot', 'anger', 'leave', 'little', 'bit', 'less', 'feeling', ""'ve"", 'had', 'night', 'Tae', 'Kwon', 'Doe', 'sparring', 'classes']",Never Back Down

Where there were certainly a lot of aggressive and vicious bad guys, but very few good guys to stand-up to them. It amazes me to this very day how some teenage boys develop powerful, man-like bodies at an early age, but have the emotional maturity of a turnip! Is this phenomenon universal in American society? Where does all this aggressiveness and malevolence towards those physically weaker than one's self, come from? Is it some sort of malfunctioning biological drive? Or, is it learned at home from an abusive parent? If only we could find the right physical trainer as our hero did! Wow! It could move mountains for so many people who are viciously bullied by their fellow, physically stronger classmates!Never Back Down is neither maudlin or trite! It discusses real issues we all will face at some point in our life - like making a big mistake, relocating to a different community, falling in love, defending one's self from physical or emotional harm, dealing with the loss of a loved one, submitting to someone wiser than yourself, and learning to manage anger, regret and grief!

1146341,A38UHOCEKSUOSP,B0014DZ2WS,"dominion_ruler ""Bryan""","[1, 2]","Its easy to (and many already have) compare Never Back Down to the classic Karate Kid, as the plot is quite similar, but this film is even more alike a lesser known (though pretty decent) B-movie from the early 90's titled ""Showdown""  Showdown is basically a stronger more agressive version of Karate Kid that actually had some decent fighting action and featured Billy Blanks (not a great actor, but he can sure fight).  Never Back Down is also a more agressive version of Karate Kid with bigger and better fights, though I would say not quite as good as some of the fights in Showdown.  Reason being is all the frantic editing that is typical of American martial art films that still remains a looong way from the beautiful straight shots featured in Asian cinema fighting.  The fights still look and feel very intense thanks to close directing and smacking sound effects, and are still fun to enjoy in their own right.  But in the end, its the combination of elements that come together and make this movie enjoyable as a whole.Ok, so the story isn't completely original and a few might say eh, it's a bit cheesy.  But for the kind of movie this is I must say there was a little more effort and thought put into than I expected.  While I have already mentioned the fights aren't up to par to Asian cinema, they are still fun nonetheless.  In addition to the hard sound effects and close directing, the booming soundtrack and flashy arenas (take an all-out packed club for example) add to the guilty pleasure of watching the fight action.  And while most of the film consists of training, the meat of the fights is a good 15 minutes at the film's climax.  As for that story, it features a young man named Jake, still in school who has moved to a new town (Orlando, FL) and gets the beat-down from another boy who is the top MMA (Mixed Martial Arts) at the school (this guy even sets up fights under the football bleachers).  Jake goes off to train with a MMA master (Djimon Hounsou - a nice addition to the film I might add) and goes through a series of exercises and the usual you'd expect from these kind of films.  Serioulsy its all too much like Showdown but I admit I couldn't help getting into this version.Karate Kid is a classic yes, but a bit outdated and Showdown (despite some good fights) is also outdated and just a bit too cheesy, so here's the newest version of the classic storyline we can't help but enjoy - it's flashier, harder, punchier (no pun) and actually put together fairly well.  It's very typical American martial arts film style, but its a lot better than most I have seen - it's just a lot of fun.Acting - 3.5Action - 4Characters - 3.5Story - 4Overall - 4",4,More like Showdown than Karate Kid,1217289600,"07 29, 2008",2008,2686,"['easy', 'many', 'already', 'have', 'compare', 'Never', 'Back', 'Down', 'classic', 'Karate', 'Kid', 'plot', 'quite', 'similar', 'film', 'even', 'more', 'alike', 'lesser', 'known', 'pretty', 'decent', 'B-movie', 'early', '90', 'titled', 'Showdown', 'Showdown', 'basically', 'stronger', 'more', 'agressive', 'version', 'Karate', 'Kid', 'actually', 'had', 'decent', 'fighting', 'action', 'featured', 'Billy', 'Blanks', 'not', 'great', 'actor', 'can', 'sure', 'fight', 'Never', 'Back', 'Down', 'also', 'more', 'agressive', 'version', 'Karate', 'Kid', 'bigger', 'better', 'fights', 'would', 'say', 'not', 'quite', 'as', 'good', 'fights', 'Showdown', 'Reason', 'being', 'frantic', 'editing', 'typical', 'American', 'martial', 'art', 'films', 'still', 'looong', 'way', 'beautiful', 'straight', 'shots', 'featured', 'Asian', 'cinema', 'fighting', 'fights', 'still', 'look', 'feel', 'very', 'intense', 'thanks', 'close', 'directing', 'smacking', 'sound', 'effects', 'are', 'still', 'fun', 'enjoy', 'own', 'right', 'end', 'combination', 'elements', 'come', 'together', 'make', 'movie', 'enjoyable', 'whole.Ok', 'story', ""n't"", 'completely', 'original', 'few', 'might', 'say', 'eh', 'bit', 'cheesy', 'kind', 'movie', 'must', 'say', 'was', 'little', 'more', 'effort', 'thought', 'put', 'expected', 'have', 'already', 'mentioned', 'fights', 'are', ""n't"", 'up', 'par', 'Asian', 'cinema', 'are', 'still', 'fun', 'nonetheless', 'addition', 'hard', 'sound', 'effects', 'close', 'directing', 'booming', 'soundtrack', 'flashy', 'arenas', 'take', 'all-out', 'packed', 'club', 'example', 'guilty', 'pleasure', 'watching', 'fight', 'action', 'most', 'film', 'training', 'meat', 'fights', 'good', '15', 'minutes', 'film', 'climax', 'story', 'young', 'man', 'named', 'Jake', 'still', 'school', 'who', 'moved', 'new', 'town', 'Orlando', 'FL', 'beat-down', 'boy', 'who', 'top', 'MMA', 'Mixed', 'Martial', 'Arts', 'school', 'guy', 'even', 'up', 'fights', 'football', 'bleachers', 'Jake', 'train', 'MMA', 'master', 'Djimon', 'Hounsou', 'nice', 'addition', 'film', 'might', 'add', 'series', 'exercises', 'usual', ""'d"", 'expect', 'kind', 'films', 'Serioulsy', 'too', 'much', 'Showdown', 'admit', 'could', ""n't"", 'help', 'getting', 'version.Karate', 'Kid', 'classic', 'yes', 'bit', 'outdated', 'Showdown', 'good', 'fights', 'also', 'outdated', 'just', 'bit', 'too', 'cheesy', 'so', 'here', 'newest', 'version', 'classic', 'storyline', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'enjoy', 'flashier', 'harder', 'punchier', 'pun', 'actually', 'put', 'together', 'fairly', 'well', 'very', 'typical', 'American', 'martial', 'arts', 'film', 'style', 'lot', 'better', 'most', 'have', 'seen', 'just', 'lot', 'fun.Acting', '3.5Action', '4Characters', '3.5Story', '4Overall', '4']",Never Back Down

1146362,AAW58LG72PG7I,B0014DZ2WS,"Martin Asiner ""Adjunct College Instructor""","[0, 0]","If watching NEVER BACK DOWN seems familiar, it is.  The plot, themes, and fight sequences are taken straight from THE KARATE KID, THE FIGHT CLUB, and any presentation of the UFC.  Sean Faris has the task of playing an updated Ralph Machio, a high school kid who moves into jock territory, where he is soon tricked into facing a serious beat down from the local mixed martial arts star (Cam Gigandet)--also a high school student.  In real life, both are pushing thirty yet play teens. The age differential is only one area that marks this film more as a fantasy than either of its progenitors.  The high school that Faris attends is populated exclusively by jock types (Faris/Gigandet), lovely model types (Amber Heard who plays the love interest), and assorted nerds who exist only to suffer at the fists of the bully boys. Except for Faris, everyone is impossibly rich.  There are nightly parties at mansions, where Gatsby-like, entertainment is provided in the form of ritualized beatdowns.  The plot is based on the successful KARATE KID model.  In this case the Pat Morita role is played by Djion Honsou, who teaches the martial arts not as a stylized kata in karate but as the much copied format seen weekly in the Octagon of the UFC. Honsou, like Morita before him, perpetuates the belief that one can teach a novice enough about fighting in a few weeks to win a local championship. The training sessions are grim and brutal.  The forward thrust of the film is the climax between Faris and Gigandet, with a number of ROCKY sequences used.  Unlike Machio, who played the Karate Kid as a basically likable sort, Faris acts more like an unregenerate jerk.  He is filled with rage over the death of his father, and he unwisely disregards the sage advice of his sensei, who like Pat Morita, has his own issues with the past.  Faris reminds me of an early Tom Cruise, both of whom have the ability to rise above a lame script to give watchable performances.  However, in NEVER BACK DOWN, the lack of originality limits audience interest to the numerous fight scenes, all of which have been done before, done better, and done with more flair.",3,Been There Done That,1236384000,"03 7, 2009",2009,2141,"['watching', 'NEVER', 'BACK', 'DOWN', 'familiar', 'plot', 'themes', 'fight', 'sequences', 'are', 'taken', 'straight', 'THE', 'KARATE', 'KID', 'THE', 'FIGHT', 'CLUB', 'presentation', 'UFC', 'Sean', 'Faris', 'task', 'playing', 'updated', 'Ralph', 'Machio', 'high', 'school', 'kid', 'who', 'jock', 'territory', 'where', 'soon', 'tricked', 'facing', 'serious', 'beat', 'down', 'local', 'mixed', 'martial', 'arts', 'star', 'Cam', 'Gigandet', 'also', 'high', 'school', 'student', 'real', 'life', 'are', 'pushing', 'thirty', 'yet', 'play', 'teens', 'age', 'differential', 'only', 'one', 'area', 'film', 'more', 'fantasy', 'progenitors', 'high', 'school', 'Faris', 'populated', 'exclusively', 'jock', 'types', 'Faris/Gigandet', 'lovely', 'model', 'types', 'Amber', 'Heard', 'who', 'love', 'interest', 'assorted', 'nerds', 'who', 'exist', 'only', 'suffer', 'fists', 'bully', 'Faris', 'everyone', 'impossibly', 'rich', 'are', 'nightly', 'parties', 'mansions', 'where', 'Gatsby-like', 'entertainment', 'provided', 'form', 'ritualized', 'beatdowns', 'plot', 'based', 'successful', 'KARATE', 'KID', 'model', 'case', 'Pat', 'Morita', 'role', 'played', 'Djion', 'Honsou', 'who', 'martial', 'arts', 'not', 'stylized', 'kata', 'karate', 'much', 'copied', 'format', 'seen', 'weekly', 'Octagon', 'UFC', 'Honsou', 'Morita', 'belief', 'one', 'can', 'teach', 'novice', 'enough', 'fighting', 'few', 'weeks', 'win', 'local', 'championship', 'training', 'sessions', 'are', 'grim', 'brutal', 'forward', 'thrust', 'film', 'climax', 'Faris', 'Gigandet', 'number', 'ROCKY', 'sequences', 'used', 'Machio', 'who', 'played', 'Karate', 'Kid', 'basically', 'likable', 'sort', 'Faris', 'more', 'unregenerate', 'jerk', 'filled', 'rage', 'death', 'father', 'unwisely', 'sage', 'advice', 'sensei', 'who', 'Pat', 'Morita', 'own', 'issues', 'past', 'Faris', 'early', 'Tom', 'Cruise', 'whom', 'have', 'ability', 'rise', 'lame', 'script', 'give', 'watchable', 'performances', 'However', 'NEVER', 'BACK', 'DOWN', 'lack', 'originality', 'limits', 'audience', 'interest', 'numerous', 'fight', 'scenes', 'have', 'been', 'done', 'before', 'done', 'better', 'done', 'more', 'flair']",Never Back Down

So when the family has to move down to Florida, Jake is depressed. And to make things worse, kids at his new school know about his dad.

There are so many reasons that I wanted to give it more than three stars.Though it's derivative of other similarly-themed movies - new kid in school, while battling personal demons, must prove himself against the established bully - ""Never Back Down"" has an appealing hero in the form of Sean Faris as Jake Tyler, a villain that brings out the hisses (Cam Gigandet), a comely love interest (Amber Heard), an encouraging sidekick (Evan Peters), and a wise sage/trainer that also has a ""cross to bear""  (Djimon Hounsou).The fight scenes - of which there are two major ones - are well-done and, remarkably, not very graphic in their ""blood splatter.""  Both Faris and Gigandet obviously spent some time in the gym and had some mixed martial arts training to pull off the convincing battles.The unrated film also features mild profanity, in comparison to other youth-oriented films.  One would think that a film with so much testosterone would have its characters spouting obscenities in every sentence, but ""Never Back Down"" is refreshingly absent of many.Like I said, I'd like to give it four stars but it's just an average popcorn movie with a simple plot, adequate performances, and a satisfying conclusion.One major criticism that I have is that the producers try to pass off Orlando - the film's setting - as being similar to its neighbor to the south, Miami.  Though a major metropolis in its own right, Orlando is NOT ""Northern Miami Beach,"" and should not be compared as such.Also, Faris's character seems to have enrolled in one of the most affluent schools in America where the kids have major social lives.  The party, where Faris and Gigandet have their first physical encounter, must be attended by well over two hundred kids, in various stages of ""development"", resulting in some suggestive situations, especially in a scene between two girls in a bubble-laden bathtub.The latter is probably a teenaged boy's fantasy but serves to present an image that is pure fiction.",3,'Would like to give it four stars,1221177600,"09 12, 2008",2008,2007,"['really', 'liked', 'movie', 'are', 'so', 'many', 'reasons', 'wanted', 'give', 'more', 'three', 'derivative', 'other', 'similarly-themed', 'movies', 'new', 'kid', 'school', 'battling', 'personal', 'demons', 'must', 'prove', 'established', 'bully', 'Never', 'Back', 'Down', 'appealing', 'hero', 'form', 'Sean', 'Faris', 'Jake', 'Tyler', 'villain', 'out', 'hisses', 'Cam', 'Gigandet', 'comely', 'love', 'interest', 'Amber', 'Heard', 'encouraging', 'sidekick', 'Evan', 'Peters', 'wise', 'sage/trainer', 'also', 'cross', 'bear', 'Djimon', 'Hounsou', '.The', 'fight', 'scenes', 'are', 'two', 'major', 'ones', 'are', 'well-done', 'remarkably', 'not', 'very', 'graphic', 'blood', 'splatter', 'Faris', 'Gigandet', 'obviously', 'spent', 'time', 'gym', 'had', 'mixed', 'martial', 'arts', 'training', 'pull', 'off', 'convincing', 'battles.The', 'unrated', 'film', 'also', 'mild', 'profanity', 'comparison', 'other', 'youth-oriented', 'films', 'One', 'would', 'think', 'film', 'so', 'much', 'testosterone', 'would', 'have', 'characters', 'spouting', 'obscenities', 'sentence', 'Never', 'Back', 'Down', 'refreshingly', 'absent', 'many.Like', 'said', ""'d"", 'like', 'give', 'four', 'stars', 'just', 'average', 'popcorn', 'movie', 'simple', 'plot', 'adequate', 'performances', 'satisfying', 'conclusion.One', 'major', 'criticism', 'have', 'producers', 'try', 'pass', 'off', 'Orlando', 'film', 'setting', 'being', 'similar', 'neighbor', 'south', 'Miami', 'major', 'metropolis', 'own', 'right', 'Orlando', 'NOT', 'Northern', 'Miami', 'Beach', 'should', 'not', 'be', 'compared', 'such.Also', 'Faris', 'character', 'have', 'enrolled', 'one', 'most', 'affluent', 'schools', 'America', 'where', 'kids', 'have', 'major', 'social', 'lives', 'party', 'where', 'Faris', 'Gigandet', 'have', 'first', 'physical', 'encounter', 'must', 'be', 'attended', 'well', 'two', 'hundred', 'kids', 'various', 'stages', 'development', 'resulting', 'suggestive', 'situations', 'especially', 'scene', 'two', 'girls', 'bubble-laden', 'bathtub.The', 'latter', 'probably', 'teenaged', 'boy', 'fantasy', 'present', 'image', 'pure', 'fiction']",Never Back Down

Then I caught the last ten minutes on cable and I was hooked. It helps if you're a fan of MMA fighting or any of the athletes associated with it. This film is kinda like 'Redbelt', but without David Mamet's clever writing, more accomplished actors, and complicated story. The story is simple: Jake (Sean Faris) is an angry young man who is constantly getting into fights after his father dies in a car accident. His mother (Leslie Hope), at the end of her rope trying to deal with him, decides to move the family to Florida for a new beginning. When Jake starts out at his new school he falls for the hottest girl there, a blond named Baja (Amber Heard), and  gets beaten up by her bully of a boyfriend Ryan (Cam Gigandet). Humiliated, Jake vows to learn how to fight so that he can get his revenge and get the girl. Only the movie is more than that. The acting is good, the houses and beaches these kids populate look very enticing, there's a little bit of philosophy buried underneath all the bare knuckle brawling, and the soundtrack is good. In other words : It's a movie that critics hated but that's really entertaining and fun to watch. What gives the film respectability is Djimon Hunsou who plays Jake's trainer Roqua. Roqua is from Brazil and like Jake  has a tragic past he's trying to escape from. These two butt heads but eventually  develop a strong bond that gives the film some genuine emotion. It helps that Faris is a decent enough actor who holds his own in scenes with Hunsou. The rest of the cast isn't as strong.

1146375,A19ZXK9HHVRV1X,B0014DZ2WS,Roland E. Zwick,"[0, 1]","""Never Back Down"" takes place in one of those only-in-the-movies high schools where the students spend most of their time partying, brawling and posting videos of themselves on the internet - and virtually none of it studying.Jake Tyler is the football hero with the stereotypical name who reluctantly moves from Iowa to Orlando, Florida with his mother and kid brother after the death of his father.  Jake has trouble adjusting to life in his new school where the law of the jungle clearly predominates and where the favorite extracurricular activity consists of beating one another senseless between classes.  That survival-of-the-fittest mentality is further reinforced by a sort of underground fight club whose existence is apparently known to everyone on campus except for the clueless faculty who seem utterly oblivious to all the black eyes and bruised faces that keep popping up in their classrooms on an almost daily basis.  But then what can one expect from a school in which the girls all dress like streetwalkers and the boys are all granite-jawed jocks who are suffering from a major case of testosterone-overload?This cheapjack rip-off of ""The Karate Kid"" even boasts its own version of Mr. Miyagi - a character-building mixed martial arts teacher who takes Jake under his wing, imparting two-bit life lessons while he instructs his pupil in the fine art of how not to get his butt kicked at school.The movie adheres to every single clich&eacute; endemic to the genre, including an arch villain whose super hot girlfriend switches her allegiance to the sensitive, misunderstood hero when it suddenly dawns on her what an irredeemable cad her boyfriend truly is.  And all this is done to a surfeit of fighter-in-training montage sequences backed by a generic rock soundtrack.Sean Faris has sufficient charisma to make us care about Jake, and the always splendid Djimon Hounsou brings some much needed gravitas to the proceedings as the philosophy-spouting mentor.  But the movie, as a whole, is just way too formulaic to engage our interest much beyond the ferocious and well executed fight scenes.If you're hankering for a truly great teen drama, my advice would be to tune into the latest installment of ""Friday Night Lights"" and skip ""Never Back Down"" altogether.",2,uninspired Karate Kid rip-off,1238112000,"03 27, 2009",2009,2279,"['Never', 'Back', 'Down', 'place', 'one', 'only-in-the-movies', 'high', 'schools', 'where', 'students', 'spend', 'most', 'time', 'partying', 'brawling', 'posting', 'videos', 'internet', 'virtually', 'none', 'studying.Jake', 'Tyler', 'football', 'hero', 'stereotypical', 'name', 'who', 'reluctantly', 'Iowa', 'Orlando', 'Florida', 'mother', 'kid', 'brother', 'death', 'father', 'Jake', 'trouble', 'adjusting', 'life', 'new', 'school', 'where', 'law', 'jungle', 'clearly', 'predominates', 'where', 'favorite', 'extracurricular', 'activity', 'beating', 'one', 'senseless', 'classes', 'survival-of-the-fittest', 'mentality', 'further', 'reinforced', 'sort', 'underground', 'fight', 'club', 'existence', 'apparently', 'known', 'everyone', 'campus', 'clueless', 'faculty', 'who', 'seem', 'utterly', 'oblivious', 'black', 'eyes', 'bruised', 'keep', 'popping', 'up', 'classrooms', 'almost', 'daily', 'basis', 'then', 'what', 'can', 'one', 'expect', 'school', 'girls', 'dress', 'streetwalkers', 'boys', 'are', 'granite-jawed', 'jocks', 'who', 'are', 'suffering', 'major', 'case', 'testosterone-overload', 'cheapjack', 'rip-off', 'Karate', 'Kid', 'even', 'own', 'version', 'Mr.', 'Miyagi', 'character-building', 'mixed', 'martial', 'arts', 'teacher', 'who', 'Jake', 'wing', 'imparting', 'two-bit', 'life', 'lessons', 'pupil', 'fine', 'art', 'how', 'not', 'get', 'butt', 'kicked', 'school.The', 'movie', 'adheres', 'single', 'clich', 'eacute', 'genre', 'including', 'arch', 'villain', 'super', 'hot', 'girlfriend', 'allegiance', 'sensitive', 'misunderstood', 'hero', 'when', 'suddenly', 'what', 'irredeemable', 'cad', 'boyfriend', 'truly', 'done', 'surfeit', 'fighter-in-training', 'montage', 'sequences', 'backed', 'generic', 'rock', 'soundtrack.Sean', 'Faris', 'sufficient', 'charisma', 'make', 'care', 'Jake', 'always', 'splendid', 'Djimon', 'Hounsou', 'much', 'needed', 'gravitas', 'proceedings', 'philosophy-spouting', 'mentor', 'movie', 'whole', 'just', 'way', 'too', 'formulaic', 'engage', 'interest', 'much', 'ferocious', 'well', 'executed', 'fight', 'scenes.If', ""'re"", 'hankering', 'truly', 'great', 'teen', 'drama', 'advice', 'would', 'be', 'tune', 'latest', 'installment', 'Friday', 'Night', 'Lights', 'skip', 'Never', 'Back', 'Down', 'altogether']",Never Back Down

1146379,A8ZTPTLGC4755,B0014DZ2WS,Terry,"[0, 1]","If there was a movie this year that epitomized homoeroticism, this film would win hands down.  While trying to bill itself as a modern day Karate Kid with a little bit of Fight Club and the O.C., it fails but not for lack of trying.  The movie is filled with so many cliches (bitter but good-hearted martial arts master, mean bully who is from an abusive family environment, a blond who who tries to pass herself off as smart, etc) that if it weren't for the eye candy in Sean Faris and Cam Gigandet, it would fail miserably.  What gets me is that it was really two stories that could have been intriguing combined into a slugfest.  Tyler's story could have been told more as a drama about a kid losing his parent and not forgiving himself.  McCarthy's story would have also been interesting as a kid who takes out his anger on everyone around him, except perhaps the person who deserves it: his father.  But I have to give credit where it's due.  The fight scenes are nothing short of incredible, especially the final bout between Jake and Ryan.  Kudos to the stunt coordinator for a sequence extremely well done that even the bouts in Fight Club pale in comparison to this movie.  Overall, I think Faris needs to polish up his acting abilities so he'll get more serious roles.  He isn't bad but he needs to work on how to show his emotions better.  Yes, he's extremely good-looking but good looks for a male actor can only go so far in this industry.  Gigandet, on the other hand, is an extremely talented performer who deserves to be a bigger star than he currently is.

The premise seems intriguing enough as it lured me to view it, but the storyline was incredibly disappointing as it was B-rate material. These actors were protraying high school teens who were questionably attending school. One message seemed clear: education is a low priority.I understand the main character's need to find both redemption and salvation by releasing his aggravation in the training studio, but c'mon! There is an unnecessary scene in which Faris's character takes out this anger on innocent people at a stop sign in which he gets out of the car and beats down a number of older men because of a trifling honking annoyance. Where were the police? Asleep at the donut shop? This character's anger seems to be justified in that there is no consequences for his often disturbing actions.Faris's flawed character continues as he questions his master's morality in front of his students, rebel's against his mother's authority, and set's a bad example for his younger brother. He ditches school, mouths off to authoritive figures, and grows enamored with his macho prowess around campus.Yes, he does have a past that I partially sympathize with, but his character is so unlikable that his past almost seems irrelevant. He lacks inspiration and ended up being a character for whom I was growing less supportive. During the ""Beatdown"" scene, I was wondering where the police were. I don't know of any high school that has students participating in such illegal organized activities. Where did these characters get the permission to fight?There were just too many flaws with this Hollywood projection. Normally, in movies there are moral messages, but in this movie...they were so amatuer.

I must've watched it at least 10 + times after the first day I got it, I liked it so much. I wasn't even expecting anything special from this movie at all. Especially knowing it was a MMA movie. The back of the DVD and the description on this page summarizes it well. It's pretty much a little bit of ""The Karate Kid"" mixed with a little bit of ""Fight Club."" So if you like those movies (or just one or the other), I think you will definitely find some things in this movie entertaining.Before I couldn't STAND MMA. I seriously HATED it with a PASSION because I thought it was just so stupid! Watching a couple of sweaty, bald, fugly dudes rolling around on the ground inside a caged ring like idiots for how long God knows what...? What was so special and appealing about that?!? But this movie opened my eyes and showed me a little bit about the basics, and what this sport was/is all about!Yes, it's pretty violent--but hey, this is a Fight/MMA film.  If you're not a Fight movie fan, of course you're not going to like it.  If you're not a fan of this genre--move on.  Stick to your Disney movies.  Fight movies SERIOUSLY need to make a huge comeback.  Not just with MMA, but with traditional martial arts as well.  Just like The late 80s and early 90s when Fight movies were at their prime.  How I miss those movies being taken seriously.  Anyway, NON-MMA fans, give this movie a chance, just like I did. I think you'll be glad you did.With plenty of blood, spit, sweat, crazy and deadly ""Beat-downs""... As well as....... EYE CANDY ALERT!! EYE CANDY ALERT!! EYE CANDY ALERT!!  'Sean Faris' (the male lead, Jake) looks EXACTLY like a young 'Tom Cruise.'  Ryan, who is Jake's vicious and merciless nemesis... well, he is just... OMG... Those wash-board abs!! Those piercing and menacing blue eyes!  That golden tan flesh!  HAWT! HAWT! HAWT!  *fans self*  Ladies (and Gents) should not be disappointed in this area of the film, LOL.  All of the characters are pretty spunky and have some interesting personalities and backgrounds, too. The MMA Master (or our 'Mr. Miyagi', I guess, if you will), 'Djimon Hounsou', who trains Jake throughout the movie was the PERFECT choice for this role. And how about this... There's an actual plot and a great lesson to be learned here. I certainly wasn't expecting that.Now, I consider ""Never back Down"" to be one of my all-time favorite Fight Movies in my collection. Oh, and about MMA--it's certainly not for everybody, but this movie pretty much breaks it down for you if you're interested in knowing at least little bit about the sport. I was not disappointed. Especially since I am currently studying -Aikido-.  *dodges stones thrown*  I know! I know!  I know! Yep. TOTALLY. DIFFERENT. PLANET.  I get it.  But this movie showed me exactly how essential 'ground-work' is when it comes to mastering, re-mastering, and cross-training into various martial art styles.So heeey... I actually get it now!

Jake was a star athlete on the football team at home, but in this new city he is an outsider with a reputation for being a quick tempered brawler. Making an attempt to fit in, at the invitation of a flirtatious classmate, Baja, Jake goes to a party where he is unwittingly pulled into a fight with a bully named Ryan McDonald. While he is defeated and humiliated in the fight, a classmate introduces himself to Jake and tells him about the sport known as Mixed Marshall Arts (MMA). He sees a star in Jake and asks that he meet with his mentor, Jean Roqua. It is immediately apparent to Jake that MMA is not street fighting, but rather an art form he wants to master. Roqua will take Jake under his wing, but it is up to Jake to find the patience, discipline, willingness and reason within him to succeed. For Jake, there is much more at stake than mere victory.

1146384,ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T,B0014DZ2WS,Tsuyoshi,"[1, 2]","""Never Back Down"" follows the story of a rebellious high school boy Jake Tyler (Sean Faris). Jake is a new boy in the school, living with his mother (Leslie Hope) and younger brother Charlie (Wyatt Smith) in Orlando, Florida. Though Jake is a tough boy with a troubled past, he doesn't want any more trouble now. A school bully Ryan (Cam Gigandet) wouldn't let him, though, luring him into the world ofThe story is fairly clich&eacute;d. This is in fact an updated version of ""The Karate Kid"" made in 1984 and the similarities between the two films are noticeable - a new boy in the school (living with his mother), a bully and his ex-girlfriend with whom our hero falls in love, a sensei or mentor who teaches the boy martial arts skills and something more about life, and the conclusion with a martial arts competition and one-on-one fighting.Some praise the film for its fight scenes of ""the mixed martial arts"". The fight scenes which are often brutal and bloody are well-choreographed and convincing themselves, but the showy camerawork and familiar visual gimmicks sometimes undermine the impact. I cannot reveal much, but I can say the climax takes place in the most unexciting way, an absolute and complete anticlimax.Here you have neither Elizabeth Shue nor Noriyuki Pat Morita because they have no place among these fight scenes. You have mixed martial arts sequences and Djimon Hounsou as our hero's martial arts teacher, but his character lacks the humor and humanity of Mr. Miyagi. To be sure, the star Sean Faris is more convincing than Ralph Macchio was as martial artist and troubled hero, but some of the supporting characters are really obnoxious, for instance, Jake's ""friend"" who keeps videotaping the hero's brawls and post them on the internet. I can forget the film's clich&eacute;d, simplistic story, but not this.",2,"Updated ""Karate Kid"" with More Blood and Less Emotion",1248566400,"07 26, 2009",2009,1838,"['Never', 'Back', 'Down', 'story', 'rebellious', 'high', 'school', 'boy', 'Jake', 'Tyler', 'Sean', 'Faris', 'Jake', 'new', 'boy', 'school', 'living', 'mother', 'Leslie', 'Hope', 'younger', 'brother', 'Charlie', 'Wyatt', 'Smith', 'Orlando', 'Florida', 'Though', 'Jake', 'tough', 'boy', 'troubled', 'past', ""n't"", 'want', 'more', 'trouble', 'now', 'school', 'bully', 'Ryan', 'Cam', 'Gigandet', 'would', ""n't"", 'let', 'though', 'luring', 'world', 'ofThe', 'story', 'fairly', 'clich', 'eacute', 'd.', 'fact', 'updated', 'version', 'Karate', 'Kid', 'made', '1984', 'similarities', 'two', 'films', 'are', 'noticeable', 'new', 'boy', 'school', 'living', 'mother', 'bully', 'ex-girlfriend', 'whom', 'hero', 'love', 'sensei', 'mentor', 'who', 'boy', 'martial', 'arts', 'skills', 'something', 'more', 'life', 'conclusion', 'martial', 'arts', 'competition', 'one-on-one', 'fighting.Some', 'praise', 'film', 'fight', 'scenes', 'mixed', 'martial', 'arts', 'fight', 'scenes', 'are', 'often', 'brutal', 'bloody', 'are', 'well-choreographed', 'convincing', 'showy', 'camerawork', 'familiar', 'visual', 'gimmicks', 'sometimes', 'undermine', 'impact', 'can', 'not', 'reveal', 'much', 'can', 'say', 'climax', 'place', 'most', 'unexciting', 'way', 'absolute', 'complete', 'anticlimax.Here', 'have', 'Elizabeth', 'Shue', 'Noriyuki', 'Pat', 'Morita', 'have', 'place', 'fight', 'scenes', 'have', 'mixed', 'martial', 'arts', 'sequences', 'Djimon', 'Hounsou', 'hero', 'martial', 'arts', 'teacher', 'character', 'humor', 'humanity', 'Mr.', 'Miyagi', 'be', 'sure', 'star', 'Sean', 'Faris', 'more', 'convincing', 'Ralph', 'Macchio', 'was', 'martial', 'artist', 'troubled', 'hero', 'supporting', 'characters', 'are', 'really', 'obnoxious', 'instance', 'Jake', 'friend', 'who', 'videotaping', 'hero', 'brawls', 'post', 'internet', 'can', 'forget', 'film', 'clich', 'eacute', 'd', 'simplistic', 'story', 'not']",Never Back Down

1146387,A2UUP58XPQW3GF,B0014DZ2WS,"Woopak ""The THRILL""","[11, 14]","NEVER BACK DOWN is a teen-action-martial arts drama that has all the ingredients to entertain a VERY specific audience. The film isn't going to win awards for its story, but then again, what martial arts film ever had? The film has a very formulaic and routine storyline but what caught my notice are its action sequences. Please note that this is a review of the film's ""Beat Down"" edition that supposedly contains more punches and kicks, more blood and graphic violence.A young man with an ill temper named Jake Tyler (Sean Faris) has been trying to keep his life together with his mother and younger brother after his father`s death. They move to another town from Iowa so his brother can pursue a tennis scholarship. Once in school, he gets baited by a pretty girl, Baja (Amber Heard), to a party that ended up with Jake getting his head kicked in by the resident ""Beat Down"" champ Ryan McCarthy (Cam Gigandet). Frustrated, Jake enlists Max's (Evan Peters) aid to introduce him to a master of mixed martial arts named Jean Roqua (Djimon Hounsou) with revenge on his mind. After training for sometime in the Dojo, Jake realizes more things about family, discipline and friendship; and more importantly controlling his anger. Jake isn't interested in fighting anymore. However, now that he's been training under Roqua, McCarthy is even more eager to fight Jake...The film has all the elements we can relate to; family issues, bullying at school, forgiving oneself and atonement. At first impression, I thought it was just going to be a bad rethread of ""The Karate Kid"" with just more action and violence. Well, it actually is a rehash if you think about it in regards to its plot but the film is quite entertaining. The film actually explores the issues that often plague martial artists themselves and explores the relationship between Sensei and apprentice. Jake and Jean developed a common denominator to each other which is their failings in their family. McCarthy is a martial artist without discipline and as a result becomes a brash, arrogant fighter.The direction by Jeff Wadlow knew what his goals were; and that is to provide popcorn entertainment. While the film does have a very unoriginal premise and frankly, those elements have almost been done to death; Wadlow manages to keep things small but focused. The pacing is quite competent enough to keep the viewer interested and never becomes too ambitious or pretentious by adding excess ""fat"" to the film's simple plot. There are some morality issues and quite a lot of preaching about the necessities of forgiving oneself. What helps the film along is that  the relationship between Roqua and Jake were convincing enough and I was happy it took center stage rather than the sappy blossoming ""teen love"" between Jake and Baja. Just when does a Sensei know when his student has become the best he can be? When the sensei begins learning from his apprentice.Now the film's main draw would have to be its fight sequences. For a Hollywood flick, I thought it was decently executed. Of course, the fights can never compare to the fight sequences choreographed by the legendary Yuen Woo-Ping or the best of Corey Yuen; but for the most part it was smooth enough to generate some intensity and pain in the proceedings. There is quite a bit of graphic violence in this dvd edition that stays within the realm of mixed martial arts. I credit the director that the managed to keep the scenes that make Faris and Gigandet look good and edit out the scenes that make them look bad. The fights were decent, and I thought the encounters were hard-hitting enough for what its worth. Just don't expect the fights to be in the same caliber as Asia's best martial arts action sequences.Now, the film does have its share of problems. The performance by the supporting cast does seem a little too ""wooden"" at times. Max provides some of the film's 'comic relief' but you can see from miles away that he was a simple plot device to set up the film's final climax. Amber Heard who plays Baja is pretty, sexy and attractive but I think she had so little to work with, so I can't really criticize her acting that much. Well, she acted like a girl star-struck by the new boy in town and she does do that. Jake's Mom and little brother had limited screen time but they gave Jake more character development than what was provided by visuals alone.Overall, I thought ""Never Back Down"" is an entertaining enough experience. It does play its cards well enough and it stayed focused on its main premise. Sure, its premise is pretty simple and very unoriginal; the stereotypical love triangle definitely got in the way but I guess there has to be something for everyone. Consider it a ""Karate Kid"" remake that focuses more on its action sequences rather than the drama. The film is pretty routine but it is a worthwhile watch for action junkies with its abundance of kicks and punches to satisfy that ""fix"".Recommended for action junkies and a good rental for everybody else.
