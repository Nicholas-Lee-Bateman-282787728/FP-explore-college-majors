This ""comedy"" deals with a very unlikeable and unappealing family's events surrounding the death of their equally unlikeable father. Sounds like a real knee-slapper, right? Yes folks, it's as funny as it sounds as 99% of the characters are incredibly annoying to watch and are almost to a one without redeeming qualities. Bitter old women, trifling and lazy men, bratty kids, ad nauseum.BUT- LL Cool J (James Todd Smith)'s character does have a nice moment at the funeral where he tries to make some sense out of all this nonsense and straighten out this ultra-dysfunctional motley crew. Thus it gets two stars instead of one from me. However, the mess that one has to sit through to get to this good part near the end just ain't worth it. Don't waste your time.However, the one interesting thing about this film is that it is one of the few films of recent times with a Black cast where race isn't even MENTIONED or bears no relevence to the plot.

Whoopi Goldberg plays the matriarch of an extended family whose members turn inside out when their ""Mean and Surly"" grandfather dies, leaving two sons (LL Cool J, Anthony Anderson) to deal with the problems that have divided them for too many years. Viveca Fox (in a surprisingly disappointing performance) and Jada Pinkett Smith (who tries to be charming but ends up going over the top with her role) play their wives. The film's best moments come from the very funny Loretta Devine as the ultra religious and highly exasperated aunt whose dresses always match her Bible; she comes as close as possible to giving this film some good rhythm. Other than that, the film has no real moments of tenderness, no exposition of character depth, nor much payoff in the end.

666750,A2GWN6XQR6EH3R,B00005N5SI,"Chelli Browne ""Chelli""","[0, 0]","Movie Kingdom Come's great surprise actor was LL Cool J, whose acting was superb.  He is the star of the movie, named Ray Bud, becoming the patriarch in his family at the death of his father.  And, he pulls it off with a class act.  Of course, actress Vivica Fox does an exellently superb acting as his perfect wife, Lucille, who is trying to keep her own problems to herself, namely issues trying to have children.  Loretta Devine is another great actress in every movie she takes on.  In this one, she brings out the comedy of a religious sister-in-law, Aunt Marguerite, burdened with being a widow with two delinguent sons who she tries to whip into action with her religious tongue.  Jada Pinkett plays a comedy part in this movie as the wild & crazy Sharese, a low-class wife of Junior, Ray's brother.  She wanted a singing career before her marriage and kids.  Junior is played by Anthony Anderson, who is great with comedy anyway.  He stars as the penniless brother with wild ideas, no common sense and he and Sharese are saddled with three bratty children.  Darius McCrary does an excellent acting job as Ray's delinquent cousin, Royce, son of Marguerite, who finally matures at the end.  The actor that plays the part of the auto repair shop owner, Clyde, Ray's boss, is so thoroughly hilarious with his scenes from start to finish.  Toni Braxton is the beautiful rich in-law married to a lawyer cousin who shows up to the funeral alone and reveals to Sharese that she should appreciate her husband and her poor life because riches don't always equal happiness.  The movie also stars Cedric-the-Entertainer who plays off his part so well as the lisp-speaking minister, over-burdened but sincere.  It's revealed from the beginning of the movie that Ray Bud's father lived the last years of his life as a grouch with Mrs. Bud, starred by Whoopie Goldberg, choosing not to hide her dislike of her husband's ways.  Whoopie Goldberg shows her excellent acting skills to the hilt with such a beautiful low-key portrayal of a patient quietly intelligent newly-widowed mother of two men, Ray and Junior.  Junior is so caught up in his own crazy hopscotch life, trying to make up to Sharese for his promiscuious affair that he doesn't contemplate overmuch seeing his father's coffin.  Cousin Royce already lost his father to death and shows Ray that its alright to feel hurt over the death of his father.  It's up to Ray to show and reveal how he felt about his father.

The supporting cast, including Cedric the Entertainer, are also on hand to bring to life a funny farce on death and dying, dysfunction and survival. Admittedly, perhaps a few of the plot devices may be trite, but it's very rare for a movie not to have a few over used plots or farcial moments. This movie is all about family surviving family and life and trying to rise above whatever life has in store - be it fate or human blunder. Goldberg plays Mama Rae, a stoic and strong woman, who does know her own mind. When her husband drops dead at the breakfast table, she continues on - with an assortment of family members and friends who are coming home to &quot; help &quot; her. The always amazing Loretta Devine, the bombastic, morally and religiously effusive, bounds onto the screen and doesn't stop chewing the scenery throughout her turn as Aunt Marguerite - the long suffering sister of the recently departed Bud and the mother of two lowdown sons, who try her patience at every turn. LL Cool J is the eldest son of Mama Rae and Bud, who battles his own demons, but seems to bring stability to a very fractured family. Pinkett - Smith is the one person that every family seems to have - The Drama Queen and the Eternal Victim. The rest of the cast deserves to be singled out, but time and space is limited. The bottomline is - this is a movie that can make you laugh - even if you stop laughing and think - &quot; this reminds me of someone in MY family. &quot; It ain't brain surgery, folks and not all movies have to be or even should be.

The Slocum family is no exception, all together in this small Southern town named Lula all these half-cocked personalities involved, and you know you're in for a major twister. I have seen this movie numerous times and it still gets me. Director Doug McHenry (Jason's Lyric) gets up close on these people and even though doesn't break any ground in filmmaking; it is darkly funny and simple.It starts off with Whoopi Goldberg who plays Mamma Ray, a woman whose ""mean and surly"" husband, Bud, drops dead at the dinner table. Her large and dysfunctional family gathers for his funeral and brings all their personal baggage with them. Eldest Son Ray Bud (LL Cool J) never liked his dad and is angry at his brother Junior (Anthony Anderson) for being a dreaming bum. Ray Bud's wife Lucille hides her unhappiness behind pills and soothing words. Junior's marriage to his childhood sweetheart, Charise (Jada Pinkett), is falling apart due to poverty, infidelity, and general unpleasantness. Bud's sister Marguerite, a bible-thumping Baptist, comes to comfort Mamma Ray (Loretta Devine) but instead fights with her own ""demon"" son, Royce (Darius McCrary). All problems may be predictably solved in the end but watching the destruction and salvation of the all these relationships endlessly entertained me.What lifted this movie above the level of sitcom was the performances, particularly Whoopi Goldberg's. She is divine in this film, portraying a strong woman of few words but great strength and dignity. Anthony Anderson is also delightful and shows a greater range than he has in ""Exit Wounds"" or ""Romeo Must Die."" His scene where he explains why he cheated on his wife is a wonderful moment of understated sadness. It is such moments balanced with his usual high-energy comedy that makes his performance so strong. Loretta Devine and Darius McCrary work together extremely well as bickering mother and son and provide the biggest laughs of the film. McCrary also has some nice serious moments and manages to flush out a pretty standard bad-boy-with-a-heart role.All the performances were strong and never flinched from honestly showing the character or situation. There are some really ugly people and circumstances in the film and they are not sugar-coated which makes them all the more funny or frightening to watch.",4,"""Are my kids drivin' you crazy?""..........""Oh, no, honey; we locked them outside.""",1169683200,"01 25, 2007",2007,2391,"['Weddings', 'funerals', 'always', 'seem', 'bring', 'out', 'worst', 'families', 'Slocum', 'family', 'exception', 'together', 'small', 'Southern', 'town', 'named', 'Lula', 'half-cocked', 'personalities', 'involved', 'know', ""'re"", 'major', 'twister', 'have', 'seen', 'movie', 'numerous', 'times', 'still', 'Director', 'Doug', 'McHenry', 'Jason', 'Lyric', 'up', 'close', 'people', 'even', ""n't"", 'break', 'ground', 'filmmaking', 'darkly', 'funny', 'simple.It', 'Whoopi', 'Goldberg', 'who', 'Mamma', 'Ray', 'woman', 'mean', 'surly', 'husband', 'Bud', 'dead', 'dinner', 'table', 'large', 'dysfunctional', 'family', 'gathers', 'funeral', 'personal', 'baggage', 'Eldest', 'Son', 'Ray', 'Bud', 'LL', 'Cool', 'J', 'never', 'liked', 'dad', 'angry', 'brother', 'Junior', 'Anthony', 'Anderson', 'being', 'dreaming', 'bum', 'Ray', 'Bud', 'wife', 'Lucille', 'unhappiness', 'pills', 'soothing', 'words', 'Junior', 'marriage', 'childhood', 'sweetheart', 'Charise', 'Jada', 'Pinkett', 'falling', 'apart', 'due', 'poverty', 'infidelity', 'general', 'unpleasantness', 'Bud', 'sister', 'Marguerite', 'bible-thumping', 'Baptist', 'comfort', 'Mamma', 'Ray', 'Loretta', 'Devine', 'instead', 'fights', 'own', 'demon', 'son', 'Royce', 'Darius', 'McCrary', 'problems', 'may', 'be', 'predictably', 'solved', 'end', 'watching', 'destruction', 'salvation', 'relationships', 'endlessly', 'entertained', 'me.What', 'lifted', 'movie', 'level', 'sitcom', 'was', 'performances', 'particularly', 'Whoopi', 'Goldberg', 'divine', 'film', 'portraying', 'strong', 'woman', 'few', 'words', 'great', 'strength', 'dignity', 'Anthony', 'Anderson', 'also', 'delightful', 'greater', 'range', 'Exit', 'Wounds', 'Romeo', 'Must', 'Die', 'scene', 'where', 'why', 'cheated', 'wife', 'wonderful', 'moment', 'understated', 'sadness', 'such', 'moments', 'balanced', 'usual', 'high-energy', 'comedy', 'performance', 'so', 'strong', 'Loretta', 'Devine', 'Darius', 'McCrary', 'work', 'together', 'extremely', 'well', 'bickering', 'mother', 'son', 'provide', 'biggest', 'laughs', 'film', 'McCrary', 'also', 'nice', 'serious', 'moments', 'manages', 'flush', 'out', 'pretty', 'standard', 'bad-boy-with-a-heart', 'role.All', 'performances', 'were', 'strong', 'never', 'flinched', 'honestly', 'showing', 'character', 'situation', 'are', 'really', 'ugly', 'people', 'circumstances', 'film', 'are', 'not', 'sugar-coated', 'more', 'funny', 'frightening', 'watch']",Kingdom Come
