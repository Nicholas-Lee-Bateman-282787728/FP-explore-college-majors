844661,A14Q5D3QYA8FPV,B0002S94IY,Shopper,"[5, 5]","The film we see here entitled ""Profile of a Serial Killer"" is actually the twelfth installement (named ""Afraid of the Dark"") of an Australian series ""Hallifax f.p."", which dealt with professional exploits of a forensic psychiatrist, Jane Halifax (Rebecca Gibney). There were a total of twenty one episodes that originally aired on Australian TV between 1994 and 2002. Many of the guest stars are now well known names in the US, such as Guy Pearce or Hugh Jackman. The temptation to profit from Jackman's popularity must have been only too great, hence the re-named, re-packaged product. Even so, his strictly supporting role does not warrant the top billing on the DVD cover. Still, the actor gets enough screen time to make this DVD a good buy for any fan. Here, Jackman is a young police detective who briefly becomes involved with Halifax, while they both work to solve a mass murder. Interestingly, if you believe the IMDb info, Rebecca Gibney is only four years older then Jackman. However, just before they ingage in an intimate moment, her character tells him she is ""old enough to be his mother""... Hmmm...I must admit, the decision to purchase the DVD had been strictly influenced by my being a fan of Hugh Jackman's. It was interesting to hear his Australian accent in full bloom and to observe his still raw, yet already charismatic acting style, two full years before the actor's breakthrough role as Wolverine in X-men. I was pleasantly surprised though at the overall quality of the production. The episode did well as a stand alone piece and ignited my couriosity about the rest of the series. It reminded me of such great UK shows as ""Inspector Morse"", or ""Frost"", only made on a smaller budget (the visibly budget approach was the reason for four, rather then five, stars), the only annoying factor being somewhat naive, by today's standards, treatment of forensic psychiatry as a crime solving tool. Oh, and the music...it's more psycho, then psychiatry...It even manages to turn the love scene into something frightening...It is a great shame that the series is not available in its entirety in Region 1. I will be purchasing it directly from an Australian vendor, though having done so on previous occasions, I know how lengthy the shipping time can be. It had taken me seven weeks to receive a copy of ""Corelli"", another series with Hugh Jackman unavailable statesite but for its pilot episode (re-named ""The Rat Tamer"" and starring Jackman's then future wife, Deborah Lee Furness).",4,"Great sample of the ""Halifax f.p."" series...",1244419200,"06 8, 2009",2009,2503,"['film', 'see', 'here', 'entitled', 'Profile', 'Serial', 'Killer', 'actually', 'twelfth', 'installement', 'named', 'Afraid', 'Dark', 'Australian', 'series', 'Hallifax', 'f.p', 'professional', 'exploits', 'forensic', 'psychiatrist', 'Jane', 'Halifax', 'Rebecca', 'Gibney', 'were', 'total', 'twenty', 'one', 'originally', 'aired', 'Australian', 'TV', '1994', '2002', 'Many', 'guest', 'stars', 'are', 'now', 'well', 'known', 'names', 'US', 'such', 'Guy', 'Pearce', 'Hugh', 'Jackman', 'temptation', 'profit', 'Jackman', 'popularity', 'must', 'have', 'been', 'only', 'too', 'great', 'hence', 're-named', 're-packaged', 'product', 'Even', 'so', 'strictly', 'supporting', 'role', 'not', 'warrant', 'top', 'billing', 'DVD', 'cover', 'Still', 'actor', 'enough', 'screen', 'time', 'make', 'DVD', 'good', 'buy', 'fan', 'Here', 'Jackman', 'young', 'police', 'detective', 'who', 'becomes', 'involved', 'Halifax', 'work', 'solve', 'mass', 'murder', 'Interestingly', 'believe', 'IMDb', 'info', 'Rebecca', 'Gibney', 'only', 'four', 'years', 'older', 'then', 'Jackman', 'However', 'just', 'ingage', 'intimate', 'moment', 'character', 'old', 'enough', 'be', 'mother', 'Hmmm', 'must', 'admit', 'decision', 'purchase', 'DVD', 'had', 'been', 'strictly', 'influenced', 'being', 'fan', 'Hugh', 'Jackman', 'was', 'interesting', 'hear', 'Australian', 'accent', 'full', 'bloom', 'observe', 'still', 'raw', 'yet', 'already', 'charismatic', 'acting', 'style', 'two', 'full', 'years', 'actor', 'breakthrough', 'role', 'Wolverine', 'X-men', 'was', 'pleasantly', 'surprised', 'overall', 'quality', 'production', 'episode', 'did', 'well', 'stand', 'alone', 'piece', 'ignited', 'couriosity', 'rest', 'series', 'reminded', 'such', 'great', 'UK', 'Inspector', 'Morse', 'Frost', 'only', 'made', 'smaller', 'budget', 'visibly', 'budget', 'approach', 'was', 'reason', 'four', 'rather', 'then', 'five', 'stars', 'only', 'annoying', 'factor', 'being', 'somewhat', 'naive', 'today', 'standards', 'treatment', 'forensic', 'psychiatry', 'crime', 'solving', 'tool', 'Oh', 'music', 'more', 'psycho', 'then', 'psychiatry', 'even', 'turn', 'love', 'scene', 'something', 'frightening', 'great', 'shame', 'series', 'not', 'available', 'entirety', 'Region', '1', 'will', 'be', 'purchasing', 'directly', 'Australian', 'vendor', 'having', 'done', 'so', 'previous', 'occasions', 'know', 'how', 'lengthy', 'shipping', 'time', 'can', 'be', 'had', 'taken', 'seven', 'weeks', 'receive', 'copy', 'Corelli', 'series', 'Hugh', 'Jackman', 'unavailable', 'statesite', 'pilot', 'episode', 're-named', 'Rat', 'Tamer', 'starring', 'Jackman', 'then', 'future', 'wife', 'Deborah', 'Lee', 'Furness']",Profile Of A Serial Killer

I LOVE X-Men and always will, but it was nice to see him do something else.  There is also an EPIC love scene between Hugh and Rebecca Gibney!
