In the course of the chase, he dropped down from two legs to four. The effects, I'll admit right up front, were great. This looked far better than the old 70s (I think) version called THE SHAGGY D.A., which I haven't seen. But even so, it sucks. I didn't need sound or subtitles, and I didn't need but 5 or 10 minutes to figure out that it sucks. True sucking is like that. (Yeah, I saw the bit with the Scrabble board. ""I am Dad."" Whoop dee freaking doggy doo.) It's possible we underestimate Tim Allen's ability as an actor, perhaps because THE SANTA CLAUSE was so unforgivably bad. But even so, this movie sucks.

The movie also stars his wife (Kristen Davis; known best for her role in Sex and the City) and his two children. The family is trying to do everything they can to reverse the spell and bring Tim's character back to normal. I watched this 2 years ago when it came out in August 2006 (better to watch with others to get more out of the experience). This is a great family movie and it will keep you laughing every couple of minutes.

I have not seen the original version of this movie, but really enjoyed this film!  There are some great special effects, action scenes that your kids will split up in laughter with!  The character fits Tim Allen very well, he's kind of a scatter brained all business/attorney dad that trys to do the right thing, maybe spreading himself too thin, ultimately overlooking the ever changing needs of his growing children.  With the help of a stray dog, and unfortunate event which causes the dog and dad to reverse rolls, in the end the dog helps him to see his mis-guided ways he's losing his children.  There are some comical scenes of Tim slobbering, scratching, doing really funny dog things, sometimes infront of his court proceedings and clients, yikes!  Likewise, the dog is able to understand and communicate non-verbally with the children and mom to convince them that he is the dad.  The dad's crude behavior jeapardizes his career and the dog is in danger of being kidnapped by a crooked scientist with evil plans for the dog and his special abilities.

I thought he'd go on to more good movies since Galaxy Quest. But sadly that was probably his last good movie that actually gave him a good role. Although I admit I thought Big Trouble was decent. The Santa Clause 1 and 2 were decent too but I rather see him as Tim Taylor again than in...Santa Clause 3 which is coming out soon. Anyway he isn't bad here even if he's just talking for a dog most the movie.It's basically...Look Who's Talking with a dog. Still it's mildly funny and entertaining and not a bad movie for the whole family. That is if won't be distrubed by a dog with a frog's body or a snake with a dog tail, or monkey that barks. The villian played by Robert Downey jr. fools around with genetics since the shaggy dog that bit Allen lived for years and years. So he's trying to discover the fountain of youth through the dog. Downey jr. is an under-rated actor that always adds some fun to no matter what movie he is in. I disagree with Ebert & Roeper who basically said he was the best thing about the movie though. I think Allen is kinda better here. He deserves better but I don't think anyone else could've been as good for the role.

Fontenot ""Prairie Cajun Regenerated!""","[5, 5]","Although three-and-a-half stars is a better rating in my opinion, I decided to round Disney's update of ""The Shaggy D.A."" and ""The Shaggy Dog"" due to the fact that it's a family film.  While more and more family fare seems to be making its way to the big screen lately (which isn't a bad thing), so much of it isn't worth viewing.  ""The Shaggy Dog"" is worth a couple of views if not more.  I originally planned to write a review of this movie when it first came out on DVD, but due to a number of circumstances, I wasn't able to.  I'm glad I waited.  Having had the opportunity to watch this film a couple of more times, it has grown on me considerably and I've found that it gets better with multiple viewings.The story revolves around deputy D.A. Dave Douglas, who's prosecuting a school teacher for a local genetics lab whenever the teacher is accused of trying to burn the lab down.  The lab's second-in-command (a very funny Robert Downey, Jr.) is determined to get the teacher put away so that he can continue his ""ethical"" experiments.  Dave's daughter, Carly (Zena Gray), supports the teacher and tries to prove that the lab is doing cruel tests on animals.  While all of this is going on, Dave is trying to keep his family together.  His daughter dislikes him for his work for the lab.  His son, Josh (Spenser Breslin) tries to impress him by playing football, despite the fact that he'd rather try out for the school's performance of ""Grease.""  His wife, the lovely Kristin Davis, feels ignored and unloved due to Dave's focusing too much on his work.  Matters literally get hairier when Dave is bitten by one of the lab's animals, which happens to be a three hundred-year old sheepdog.  He begins to take on the habits and instincts of a dog and, eventually, turns into one whenever he's triggered by an impulse such as chasing a cat or fetching a stick.All of the chaos is pulled off with solid comedic effort.  There's no strong language that I recall, only brief peril, the action is humorous and the cast looks as if they had fun making the film.  The special effects are decent, and Tim Allen's transformations are swiftly executed without revealing much to the crowd.  There's also a light anti-animal testing message, but it never comes across as preachy.The supporting cast is solid for a light film such as this.  Danny Glover, Jane Curtin, Philip Baker Hall and Annabelle Gurwitch all give solid and funny performances.As family films go, you can do a lot better and a lot worse than ""The Shaggy Dog.""  It won't win any awards but it will entertain the entire family.  Tim Allen has become a staple of family entertainment, and this flick only solidifies that.

992158,A3R4ZEDVRUWJNO,B000FKP3XY,Mark,"[3, 8]","I'm sorry.  I really am.  For those parents who would rather rent this than go see something worthwhile like Zemeckis' new film Monster House or Pixar's latest film Cars, I make the aforementioned apology.  For the fact is, I only made it through the first twenty or so minutes of this film.  I generally do not turn movies off, and I usually watch awful films just to comment on how awful they are.  But, reader, I did not need to watch this film to know how awful it would be, for I feel as if I have seen this film so many different times, only with different titles.  Television shows, other films, and different novels and stories have all emulated (or tried to emulate) this basic plot: Man is a horrible, overworking father, who gets transformed in some way shape or form into something other than himself, hilarity ensues in the form of a big brew-ha-ha, someone in the family finds out, more brew-ha-ha, dad learns his lesson, the end.  The brew-ha-ha is not exclusive to certain parts of this film; it may occur in different areas.  According to the cookie-cutter-film-plot (I'm starting to write like Laura Mulvey), Tim Allen plays the overworking, ignorant, district attorney father, who ignores his family.  He makes empty promises, doesn't know his own wife, and his only hope is that his son plays football.  After a 300-year-old dog is discovered living in Mongolia, a huge medical corporation brings him to the United States.  Allen's (I don't really know his character's name) daughter is protesting the corporation, and Allen is the attorney trying to help the corporation.  His daughter sneaks into the lab (where the hell are the security guards?) and frees the dog, taking it home with them.  Allen objects to having a dog, and the dog bites him, sending dog-shaped DNA coursing through his veins.  The next day, Allen begins his dog-behavior, enjoying every smell that he encounters, eating cereal with just his mou.........What happened?  Oh yeah, that's the point in the film where I turned it off.  Why would anyone need to watch it past that point?  The only relief in the film (and I don't know if he contintued to be relief) was Robert Downey, Jr., whose career post-rehab has skyrocketed.  His quirky demeanor is extremely funny, and he seems to have modeled it somewhat off of his performance in Kiss Kiss, Bang Bang.  Before I leave you family film lovers to pummel my review with unhelpful votes, I want to pose one vital question.  What has happened to Tim Allen's career?  After Home Improvement went off of the air, he has starred in many disgusting and awful films.  What films, you say?  Joe Somebody, Christmas With the Kranks, and this trash come to mind.  The only really worthwhile is 1999's underrated Galaxy Quest.  Please, Mr. Allen, I know there is at least a small kernel of acting talent hidden inside of you.  My advice is to follow in the footsteps of such comedic talents as Jim Carrey and Robin Williams and take a stab at a serious film now and then.  Only then can we determine if you can act.",1,Ugh...,1154476800,"08 2, 2006",2006,3047,"[""'m"", 'sorry', 'really', 'am', 'parents', 'who', 'would', 'rather', 'rent', 'go', 'see', 'something', 'Zemeckis', 'new', 'film', 'Monster', 'House', 'Pixar', 'latest', 'film', 'Cars', 'make', 'aforementioned', 'apology', 'fact', 'only', 'made', 'first', 'twenty', 'so', 'minutes', 'film', 'generally', 'do', 'not', 'turn', 'movies', 'usually', 'watch', 'awful', 'films', 'just', 'comment', 'how', 'awful', 'are', 'reader', 'did', 'not', 'need', 'watch', 'film', 'know', 'how', 'awful', 'would', 'be', 'feel', 'have', 'seen', 'film', 'so', 'many', 'different', 'times', 'only', 'different', 'titles', 'Television', 'shows', 'other', 'films', 'different', 'novels', 'stories', 'have', 'emulated', 'tried', 'emulate', 'basic', 'plot', 'Man', 'horrible', 'overworking', 'father', 'who', 'transformed', 'way', 'shape', 'form', 'something', 'other', 'hilarity', 'ensues', 'form', 'big', 'brew-ha-ha', 'someone', 'family', 'out', 'more', 'brew-ha-ha', 'dad', 'lesson', 'end', 'brew-ha-ha', 'not', 'exclusive', 'certain', 'parts', 'film', 'may', 'occur', 'different', 'areas', 'According', 'cookie-cutter-film-plot', ""'m"", 'starting', 'write', 'Laura', 'Mulvey', 'Tim', 'Allen', 'overworking', 'ignorant', 'district', 'attorney', 'father', 'who', 'family', 'empty', 'promises', ""n't"", 'know', 'own', 'wife', 'only', 'hope', 'son', 'football', '300-year-old', 'dog', 'discovered', 'living', 'Mongolia', 'huge', 'medical', 'corporation', 'United', 'States', 'Allen', 'do', ""n't"", 'really', 'know', 'character', 'name', 'daughter', 'protesting', 'corporation', 'Allen', 'attorney', 'trying', 'help', 'corporation', 'daughter', 'sneaks', 'lab', 'where', 'hell', 'are', 'security', 'guards', 'dog', 'taking', 'home', 'Allen', 'having', 'dog', 'dog', 'sending', 'dog-shaped', 'DNA', 'coursing', 'veins', 'next', 'day', 'Allen', 'dog-behavior', 'enjoying', 'smell', 'eating', 'cereal', 'just', 'mou', 'What', 'happened', 'Oh', 'yeah', 'point', 'film', 'where', 'turned', 'off', 'Why', 'would', 'anyone', 'need', 'watch', 'point', 'only', 'relief', 'film', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'contintued', 'be', 'relief', 'was', 'Robert', 'Downey', 'Jr.', 'career', 'post-rehab', 'skyrocketed', 'quirky', 'demeanor', 'extremely', 'funny', 'have', 'modeled', 'somewhat', 'performance', 'Kiss', 'Kiss', 'Bang', 'Bang', 'leave', 'family', 'film', 'lovers', 'pummel', 'review', 'unhelpful', 'votes', 'want', 'pose', 'one', 'vital', 'question', 'What', 'happened', 'Tim', 'Allen', 'career', 'Home', 'Improvement', 'went', 'air', 'starred', 'many', 'disgusting', 'awful', 'films', 'What', 'films', 'say', 'Joe', 'Somebody', 'Christmas', 'Kranks', 'trash', 'come', 'mind', 'only', 'really', 'worthwhile', '1999', 'underrated', 'Galaxy', 'Quest', 'Please', 'Mr.', 'Allen', 'know', 'least', 'small', 'kernel', 'acting', 'talent', 'hidden', 'inside', 'advice', 'follow', 'footsteps', 'such', 'comedic', 'talents', 'Jim', 'Carrey', 'Robin', 'Williams', 'take', 'stab', 'serious', 'film', 'now', 'then', 'Only', 'then', 'can', 'determine', 'can', 'act']",N/A

And then there is a mad scientist (Robert Downey Jr.), trying to extract the secret of immortality from the shaggy hide of a 300-year-old dog he had kidnapped from a Tibetan monastery. And Carly even kidnaps it from Grant & Strictland, and brings him home, nad even trouble starts when the dog bites Douglas, that gets him starting acting like a dog too, and even looking exactly like him at times.

Earlier collaborations between comedian Tim Allen and Disney, including ""The Santa Clause"" and ""Jungle 2 Jungle"" were always hilarious.  Sticking Tim Allen into a tried-and-true storyline, the oft remade ""The Shaggy Dog"" was a safe bet on Disney's part.  This isn't Tim Allen's funniest movie and this isn't the most vibrant remake of ""The Shaggy Dog"", but it does manage to be at least mildly amusing all the way through, and at times it's even hilarious.Tim Allen plays a deputy D. A. prosecuting an animal rights activist accused of torching a laboratory in which cruel experiments were allegedly performed on animals.  What Allen's character doesn't realize is that a villainous scientist, played by the always brilliant Robert Downey Jr. who has appeared in such films as ""The Singing Detective"", has kidnapped an eternally youthful and extremely shaggy dog and is performing particularly inhumane experiments on it.  The dog escapes and bites the deputy D. A., causing him to periodically and temporarily morph into a shaggy dog, in turn allowing him to get closer to cracking the case and get closer to his family: his son (Spencer Breslin, who has already worked with Tim Allen in ""The Santa Clause 2""), his kinda cute daughter (Zena Grey), and his definitely hot wife (Kristen Davis).There are two levels of humor in this movie.  Young children will love Tim Allen's goofy physical humor.  Older audiences should appreciate the more subtle tricks Tim Allen uses to make his human character seem increasingly dog-like.  There are also some nifty computer generated effects, including a series of intriguing mutant animals.  There is one special effects trick that is uncalled for, however: ridiculous ""cells"" that resemble dog-shaped clumps of grass that bark and pant their way through the main character's blood stream.  These brief scenes take a lot away from the movie, which isn't anything to howl about, and plot holes abound, but the film is still entertaining and not a ""dog"" by any means.",3,"Definitely Not a ""Dog""",1149897600,"06 10, 2006",2006,2058,"['Shaggy', 'Dog', 'had', 'be', 'least', 'mildly', 'amusing', 'Earlier', 'collaborations', 'comedian', 'Tim', 'Allen', 'Disney', 'including', 'Santa', 'Clause', 'Jungle', '2', 'Jungle', 'were', 'always', 'hilarious', 'Sticking', 'Tim', 'Allen', 'tried-and-true', 'storyline', 'oft', 'remade', 'Shaggy', 'Dog', 'was', 'safe', 'bet', 'Disney', 'part', ""n't"", 'Tim', 'Allen', 'funniest', 'movie', ""n't"", 'most', 'vibrant', 'remake', 'Shaggy', 'Dog', 'manage', 'be', 'least', 'mildly', 'amusing', 'way', 'times', 'even', 'hilarious.Tim', 'Allen', 'deputy', 'D.', 'A.', 'prosecuting', 'animal', 'rights', 'activist', 'accused', 'torching', 'laboratory', 'cruel', 'experiments', 'were', 'allegedly', 'performed', 'animals', 'What', 'Allen', 'character', ""n't"", 'realize', 'villainous', 'scientist', 'played', 'always', 'brilliant', 'Robert', 'Downey', 'Jr.', 'who', 'appeared', 'such', 'films', 'Singing', 'Detective', 'kidnapped', 'eternally', 'youthful', 'extremely', 'shaggy', 'dog', 'performing', 'particularly', 'inhumane', 'experiments', 'dog', 'escapes', 'deputy', 'D.', 'A.', 'causing', 'periodically', 'temporarily', 'morph', 'shaggy', 'dog', 'turn', 'allowing', 'get', 'closer', 'cracking', 'case', 'get', 'closer', 'family', 'son', 'Spencer', 'Breslin', 'who', 'already', 'worked', 'Tim', 'Allen', 'Santa', 'Clause', '2', 'kinda', 'cute', 'daughter', 'Zena', 'Grey', 'definitely', 'hot', 'wife', 'Kristen', 'Davis', 'are', 'two', 'levels', 'humor', 'movie', 'Young', 'children', 'will', 'love', 'Tim', 'Allen', 'goofy', 'physical', 'humor', 'Older', 'audiences', 'should', 'appreciate', 'more', 'subtle', 'tricks', 'Tim', 'Allen', 'make', 'human', 'character', 'seem', 'increasingly', 'dog-like', 'are', 'also', 'nifty', 'computer', 'generated', 'effects', 'including', 'series', 'intriguing', 'mutant', 'animals', 'one', 'special', 'effects', 'trick', 'uncalled', 'however', 'ridiculous', 'cells', 'resemble', 'dog-shaped', 'clumps', 'grass', 'bark', 'pant', 'way', 'main', 'character', 'blood', 'stream', 'brief', 'scenes', 'take', 'lot', 'away', 'movie', ""n't"", 'anything', 'howl', 'plot', 'holes', 'abound', 'film', 'still', 'entertaining', 'not', 'dog', 'means']",N/A

My sister left halfway through when the phone rang and never came back, which allowed me to take my own measures to make the film more enjoyable.  Which worked fantastically.  I won't bother renting it again for my sister, but I made my buddies watch it that weekend and we had a pretty good time of it.

You will be seeing Tim Allen growling in the court and running after a stray cat on four, knocking over an old lady (seriously) and he finally becomes a sheep dog (with the amusing voiceover of Tim Allen himself). Don't forget that Dave is also a slightly workaholic but good father, whose marriage life is falling apart; whose son is leading an unfulfilled life, and whose daughter an animal right activist.`The Shaggy Dog' looks like two movies rolled into one. Or maybe it is more than two movies (for five writers are attached to the script). One movie is about Tim Allen doing silly things, and the other about dysfunctional family. The first plot about the father turned into a sheepdog is already silly, but the silly story works with Tim Allen here, if not perfectly. The set-pieces are pretty clich&eacute;d ones, but decently done. Still it makes me rather sad to hear the in-joke about `Toy Story' and its character here.To his credit Tim Allen does his best, making us laugh with his amusing comic performances of the man-to-mutt transformation, which deserves more screen time than the other half, all-too-familiar sub-plot about his ailing marriage. Usually when we review this kind of family-oriented pictures, we often write `Kids will love it' or something like that. But I am not sure as far as 'The Shaggy Dog' goes because I think the film's second plot may feel like a real drag for most pre-teen kids.Incredible thing is, the first plot is given a far-fetched background, and that is about an evil scientist (Robert Downey Jr.) who studies the serum extracted from a 300-year-old dog living among the Tibetan Buddhists. There is a story about wrongly accused guy (who is forgotten by the end of the film), Phillip Baker Hall's CEO in wheelchair and mutant animals. All these things clutter in the disjointed story, only confusing my head.Perhaps, as more than one reviewer on the net point out, Robert Downey Jr. who is really good with his perfect goofiness as the clueless villain, should have played the protagonist instead of Tim Allen. Or perhaps producer-actor Tim Allen should have another choice to make a film. Or maybe, just maybe, Disney should have made another move.I can hear the voice of ""no more remakes, please."" I can understand, but I don't know how many of us have really seen the original.

My son was disappointed it wasn't closer to the original he watched when he was a child. Or at least he gave me that impression. Tim Allen is very good where he gets to use his silly style of humor so of course he's best in kid's movies. I liked him and the special effects. The teens who played his children were a little annoying. I felt sorry for Robert Downey Jr. because he can do much better than this. But he has only himself to blame with his drugging.
