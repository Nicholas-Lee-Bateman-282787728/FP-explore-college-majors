1653707,AUX7KVELDYZZ6,B00D49YESS,"Brett H ""pentangle""","[48, 48]","This is a brand new six part TV series which covers the workings of the Manchester Metropolitan Police in the UK, specifically the Major Incident Team. The main idea behind the series is the interaction between the two overworked female DCs, Rachel Bailey and Janet Scott who are quite different people but who complement each other to great effect. Although they are great friends, fairly regular disagreements are a feature of their relationship. Janet is a very steady, older character in her forties, whilst Rachel is younger and more impetuous and comes up with the inspirational ideas. We learn about the personal lives of the pair of them which adds interest and impacts on their work. This contrasts the series with the likes of Law & Order, where it is all strictly professional and we find out little about the individuals.In the first episode Rachel is seriously upset about being dumped by her married lover, Nick who continues to feature as the series progresses in an increasingly prominent role. Rachel's detection skills were obviously lacking as they had been going out for two years and it had escaped her notice that he was married with kids which seems a tad unlikely. Their first case seems to somewhat mirror Rachel's personal life as it involves a guy cheating on his wife whose girlfriend is found hanged. The various murders investigated by the pair have interesting twists. One involves a possible murder of her spouse by wife and boyfriend, just lacking a body whilst another concerns a serial killer whose activities go back as far as 40 years!All this makes for highly entertaining viewing. It is well acted by the two leads played by Lesley Sharp and Suranne Jones. However, their feisty boss, DI Gill Murray, played by Amelia Bullmore, also has a very key role in the series. The many fans of Scott and Bailey will be pleased to know that there are two more series to look forward to. You almost groan inwardly when yet another cop series hits the screen, but this one is sufficiently distinctive to make it well worth viewing.",5,Entertaining New UK Police Series,1379980800,"09 24, 2013",2013,2058,"['brand', 'new', 'six', 'part', 'TV', 'series', 'workings', 'Manchester', 'Metropolitan', 'Police', 'UK', 'specifically', 'Major', 'Incident', 'Team', 'main', 'idea', 'series', 'interaction', 'two', 'overworked', 'female', 'DCs', 'Rachel', 'Bailey', 'Janet', 'Scott', 'who', 'are', 'quite', 'different', 'people', 'who', 'complement', 'other', 'great', 'effect', 'are', 'great', 'friends', 'fairly', 'regular', 'disagreements', 'are', 'feature', 'relationship', 'Janet', 'very', 'steady', 'older', 'character', 'forties', 'whilst', 'Rachel', 'younger', 'more', 'impetuous', 'up', 'inspirational', 'ideas', 'learn', 'personal', 'lives', 'pair', 'interest', 'impacts', 'work', 'series', 'likes', 'Law', 'Order', 'where', 'strictly', 'professional', 'find', 'out', 'little', 'individuals.In', 'first', 'episode', 'Rachel', 'seriously', 'upset', 'being', 'dumped', 'married', 'lover', 'Nick', 'who', 'feature', 'series', 'increasingly', 'prominent', 'role', 'Rachel', 'detection', 'skills', 'were', 'obviously', 'lacking', 'had', 'been', 'going', 'two', 'years', 'had', 'escaped', 'notice', 'was', 'married', 'kids', 'tad', 'unlikely', 'first', 'case', 'somewhat', 'mirror', 'Rachel', 'personal', 'life', 'guy', 'cheating', 'wife', 'girlfriend', 'found', 'hanged', 'various', 'murders', 'investigated', 'pair', 'have', 'interesting', 'twists', 'One', 'possible', 'murder', 'spouse', 'wife', 'boyfriend', 'just', 'lacking', 'body', 'concerns', 'serial', 'killer', 'activities', 'go', 'back', 'as', 'far', '40', 'years', 'highly', 'entertaining', 'viewing', 'well', 'acted', 'two', 'leads', 'played', 'Lesley', 'Sharp', 'Suranne', 'Jones', 'However', 'feisty', 'boss', 'DI', 'Gill', 'Murray', 'played', 'Amelia', 'Bullmore', 'also', 'very', 'key', 'role', 'series', 'many', 'fans', 'Scott', 'Bailey', 'will', 'be', 'pleased', 'know', 'are', 'two', 'more', 'series', 'look', 'forward', 'almost', 'groan', 'inwardly', 'when', 'yet', 'cop', 'series', 'screen', 'one', 'sufficiently', 'distinctive', 'make', 'well', 'viewing']",N/A

The acting by all of them is wonderful and Suranne Jones work would make Meryl Streep envious. I love that this a team of three women, with a woman heading up the force. One of my favorite episodes ended with all three women having needy men in their lives. Usually it is the women who are needy. Not in this series.

1653713,A1TPW86OHXTXFC,B00D49YESS,"prisrob ""pris,""","[4, 4]","This review is from: Scott & Bailey: Season 1 (DVD)I first saw Scott&Bailey; on our PBS station, and I liked the rapport between the two female detectives. Janet Scott played by Lesley Sharp and Rachel Bailey played by Suranne Jones.The two detectives and their female, DCI, Gill Murray played by Amelia Bullmore are clever and the scripts they are given are intelligent and witty. The detectives are friends, and their personal and private lives take a big part of this series. The cases they garner are tough and take a lot of hard work and time. The male detectives treat them as equals, which is a new and wonderful experience.Rachel Bailey is intelligent but chaos seems to follow her. She drinks too much and takes risks, her brother moves in with her. He has a criminal record and Bailey's DCI would not be happy to know this. Janet Scott is older, with two daughters, and a husband who is boring. There's a lot of conversation and red wine, some teasing, and some very serious issues discussed. This is television at its best. I found myself rooting for the detectives to get their personal problems and work related issues solved. They are attractive women but not beautiful. They sometimes turn up at work not looking their best, but that is real life, isn't it?Recommended. prisrob 01-22-14",4,Refreshing New Series,1390348800,"01 22, 2014",2014,1301,"['review', 'Scott', 'Bailey', 'Season', '1', 'DVD', 'first', 'saw', 'Scott', 'Bailey', 'PBS', 'station', 'liked', 'rapport', 'two', 'female', 'detectives', 'Janet', 'Scott', 'played', 'Lesley', 'Sharp', 'Rachel', 'Bailey', 'played', 'Suranne', 'Jones.The', 'two', 'detectives', 'female', 'DCI', 'Gill', 'Murray', 'played', 'Amelia', 'Bullmore', 'are', 'clever', 'scripts', 'are', 'given', 'are', 'intelligent', 'witty', 'detectives', 'are', 'friends', 'personal', 'private', 'lives', 'take', 'big', 'part', 'series', 'cases', 'garner', 'are', 'tough', 'take', 'lot', 'hard', 'work', 'time', 'male', 'detectives', 'treat', 'equals', 'new', 'wonderful', 'experience.Rachel', 'Bailey', 'intelligent', 'chaos', 'follow', 'too', 'much', 'risks', 'brother', 'moves', 'criminal', 'record', 'Bailey', 'DCI', 'would', 'not', 'be', 'happy', 'know', 'Janet', 'Scott', 'older', 'two', 'daughters', 'husband', 'who', 'boring', 'lot', 'conversation', 'red', 'wine', 'teasing', 'very', 'serious', 'issues', 'discussed', 'television', 'best', 'found', 'rooting', 'detectives', 'get', 'personal', 'problems', 'work', 'related', 'issues', 'solved', 'are', 'attractive', 'women', 'not', 'beautiful', 'sometimes', 'turn', 'up', 'work', 'not', 'looking', 'best', 'real', 'life', ""n't"", 'Recommended', 'prisrob', '01-22-14']",N/A
1653714,ASEBX8TBYWQWA,B00D49YESS,"Steven I. Ramm ""Steve Ramm &#34;Anything Phon...","[6, 7]","As I post this review (in June 2014) there is already one lengthy review of this DVD (from 2013), though this US release - from BBC Home Video - is due to be released on June 17, 2014. (I received an advance screener from the distributor.). This is because Amazon has a policy of combining all formats (streaming and physical product) together and the reviews of the UK region Only DVD is here too. So you should always note the date of the review.This is one of the recent series of British crime dramas making their US DVD debut from BBC Home Video.The ""trailer"" at the beginning of this DVD highlights shows like ""DCI Banks"" - which I reviewed last week  - and others in BBC crime series. I should point out that many of these shows - including this one - did not air in the UK on the BBC but, rather, on the commercial ITV network. Hence each episode is just under 45 minutes in length. Also, unlike US TV series, British crime drama series are much shorter. Season one of ""Scott and Bailey"" is just six episodes.If you've read any of my other reviews here on Amazon, you know that I am not a fan of ""spoilers"" so I won't go into much detail - though, honestly, I always feel that long reviews of mystery series give away too much info. Mysteries are called that because the less you know the better.  But I'll let you make that judgment call. One review I scanned tells you things  that occur even as late as the third episode.The two women in the title are both DCs (Deputy Constrable) and work in partnership solving crimes. The crimes in this series are okay but there is more focus on the two women's personal lives than other such shows. This makes them more human - in my opinion - as you know where their judgment  is coming from.The DVD contains one bonus. It is the now-requisite ""Behind The Scenes""  featurette - and runs nine minutes. It's interesting but it is the actual episodes that should bring you to the DVD.  The package has a label that reads ""As Seen on Your Local PBS Station"". That's because some stations aired it - and possibly in an edited version - for violence and language - but it was not aired by national PBS.I'm looking to follow these women on their cases (and in their personal lives) in the next two seasons as they are released in the US. A fourth season was commissioned and it was to start production this Spring (2014).I hope you found this review both informative and helpful.Steve Ramm""Anything Phonographic""",5,Review of DVD - (No spoilers here) - Female detective pair with complicated personal lives,1402704000,"06 14, 2014",2014,2455,"['post', 'review', 'June', '2014', 'already', 'one', 'lengthy', 'review', 'DVD', '2013', 'US', 'release', 'BBC', 'Home', 'Video', 'due', 'be', 'released', 'June', '17', '2014', 'received', 'advance', 'screener', 'distributor.', 'Amazon', 'policy', 'combining', 'formats', 'streaming', 'physical', 'product', 'together', 'reviews', 'UK', 'region', 'Only', 'DVD', 'here', 'too', 'should', 'always', 'note', 'date', 'review.This', 'one', 'recent', 'series', 'British', 'crime', 'dramas', 'making', 'US', 'DVD', 'debut', 'BBC', 'Home', 'Video.The', 'trailer', 'beginning', 'DVD', 'highlights', 'DCI', 'Banks', 'reviewed', 'last', 'week', 'others', 'BBC', 'crime', 'series', 'should', 'point', 'out', 'many', 'shows', 'including', 'one', 'did', 'not', 'air', 'UK', 'BBC', 'rather', 'commercial', 'ITV', 'network', 'Hence', 'episode', 'just', '45', 'minutes', 'length', 'Also', 'US', 'TV', 'series', 'British', 'crime', 'drama', 'series', 'are', 'much', 'shorter', 'Season', 'one', 'Scott', 'Bailey', 'just', 'six', 'episodes.If', ""'ve"", 'read', 'other', 'reviews', 'here', 'Amazon', 'know', 'am', 'not', 'fan', 'spoilers', 'wo', ""n't"", 'go', 'much', 'detail', 'honestly', 'always', 'feel', 'long', 'reviews', 'mystery', 'series', 'give', 'away', 'too', 'much', 'info', 'Mysteries', 'are', 'called', 'less', 'know', 'better', ""'ll"", 'let', 'make', 'judgment', 'call', 'One', 'review', 'scanned', 'tells', 'things', 'occur', 'even', 'as', 'late', 'third', 'episode.The', 'two', 'women', 'title', 'are', 'DCs', 'Deputy', 'Constrable', 'work', 'partnership', 'solving', 'crimes', 'crimes', 'series', 'are', 'okay', 'more', 'focus', 'two', 'women', 'personal', 'lives', 'other', 'such', 'shows', 'more', 'human', 'opinion', 'know', 'where', 'judgment', 'coming', 'from.The', 'DVD', 'one', 'bonus', 'now-requisite', 'Scenes', 'featurette', 'nine', 'minutes', 'interesting', 'actual', 'episodes', 'should', 'bring', 'DVD', 'package', 'label', 'Seen', 'Your', 'Local', 'PBS', 'Station', 'stations', 'aired', 'possibly', 'edited', 'version', 'violence', 'language', 'was', 'not', 'aired', 'national', 'PBS.I', ""'m"", 'looking', 'follow', 'women', 'cases', 'personal', 'lives', 'next', 'two', 'seasons', 'are', 'released', 'US', 'A', 'fourth', 'season', 'was', 'commissioned', 'was', 'start', 'production', 'Spring', '2014', '.I', 'hope', 'found', 'review', 'informative', 'helpful.Steve', 'Ramm', 'Anything', 'Phonographic']",N/A
