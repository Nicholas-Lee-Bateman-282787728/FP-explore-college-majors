788692,A294XIDCE087BB,B0000X2ET2,"Irreverent ""irreverent""","[8, 17]","I concur with other reviewers' high opinions of the artistic quality of this DVD, except for a minor quibble: I can't buy the biracial affair with a Detective Sergeant.  (And in a later Episode, Mirren's character gets pregnant, likewise in a work-related situation, by a married consultant, father of four kids, who lives 6000 miles away.)Jane Tennison is a hard-nosed and coolly logical Detective Chief Inspector who knows that the good ole boys, including a few big shots, are lurking in wait for an uppity woman like her to slip up.  How many Caucasian female Lieutenant Colonels in our armed forces get mixed up with African Sergeants or married fathers, especially if they work or consult with the men regularly?  (How many would keep their jobs if they did?)  However Jane's passions might burn and seethe beneath that calm exterior, she would be unlikely to slake them at work, especially with these guys, and most especially without tending to birth control.  She's savvy enough to graze more cautiously on some of the many safer possibilities in London.  However, this is not worth deducting a star.  Besides, as one writer got rich pointing out, smart women do sometimes make foolish choices.  A few smart women might even cite me as proof of this.I am happy to report that the new DVD version has the naughty words intact and does not need to be flipped.  The audio and especially the video are still below the quality one should expect for something produced so recently, although not too distractingly so.  Some stuff from the 70's is technologically better, though.This is a great detective series with a unique point of view, generally quite believable except for the odd minor quibble as set out above.  I have bought all available episodes.  It does owe a bit to Morse (what a marriage that would have made!), but who cares?  Miss Marple might not approve, but the jungle where Mirren's tigress prowls is hardly St. Mary Mead.",5,New DVD got rid of overdubbing and disk-flipping,1082073600,"04 16, 2004",2004,1944,"['concur', 'other', 'reviewers', 'high', 'opinions', 'artistic', 'quality', 'DVD', 'minor', 'quibble', 'ca', ""n't"", 'buy', 'biracial', 'affair', 'Detective', 'Sergeant', 'later', 'Episode', 'Mirren', 'character', 'pregnant', 'likewise', 'work-related', 'situation', 'married', 'consultant', 'father', 'four', 'kids', 'who', '6000', 'miles', 'away', 'Jane', 'Tennison', 'hard-nosed', 'coolly', 'logical', 'Detective', 'Chief', 'Inspector', 'who', 'good', 'ole', 'boys', 'including', 'few', 'big', 'shots', 'are', 'lurking', 'wait', 'uppity', 'woman', 'slip', 'up', 'How', 'many', 'Caucasian', 'female', 'Lieutenant', 'Colonels', 'armed', 'forces', 'get', 'mixed', 'up', 'African', 'Sergeants', 'married', 'fathers', 'especially', 'work', 'consult', 'men', 'regularly', 'How', 'many', 'would', 'keep', 'jobs', 'did', 'However', 'Jane', 'passions', 'might', 'burn', 'seethe', 'beneath', 'calm', 'exterior', 'would', 'be', 'unlikely', 'slake', 'work', 'especially', 'guys', 'most', 'especially', 'tending', 'birth', 'control', 'savvy', 'enough', 'graze', 'more', 'cautiously', 'many', 'safer', 'possibilities', 'London', 'However', 'not', 'worth', 'deducting', 'star', 'Besides', 'one', 'writer', 'got', 'rich', 'pointing', 'out', 'smart', 'women', 'do', 'sometimes', 'make', 'foolish', 'choices', 'few', 'smart', 'women', 'might', 'even', 'cite', 'proof', 'this.I', 'am', 'happy', 'report', 'new', 'DVD', 'version', 'naughty', 'words', 'intact', 'not', 'need', 'be', 'flipped', 'audio', 'especially', 'video', 'are', 'still', 'quality', 'one', 'should', 'expect', 'something', 'produced', 'so', 'recently', 'not', 'too', 'distractingly', 'so', 'stuff', '70', 'technologically', 'better', 'great', 'detective', 'series', 'unique', 'point', 'view', 'generally', 'quite', 'believable', 'odd', 'minor', 'quibble', 'set', 'out', 'have', 'bought', 'available', 'episodes', 'owe', 'bit', 'Morse', 'what', 'marriage', 'would', 'have', 'made', 'who', 'Miss', 'Marple', 'might', 'not', 'approve', 'jungle', 'where', 'Mirren', 'tigress', 'prowls', 'hardly', 'St.', 'Mary', 'Mead']",N/A

Unfortunately, when this happens, there is always not enough evidence.  So Jane and her team must prove her case.This round a girl's body is found buried in the garden.  The problem is the decomposed corps fits the description of Simone Cameron.  Also, complicating things is her brother might have been ""fitted up"" (framed) for a murder he did not commit.The inquiry starts off on a rocky note when one of the Inspectors arrests someone for possession causing quite a stir in the neighborhood.  Jane brings in Nola Cameron, the suspected victim's mother to identify the corpse's possessions. Nola identifies everything as being Simone's including DCI Tennison's watch.  To complicate things, insects found in the corpse put the murder in the summer when Simone went missing in February.After the ME examines the remains, it is determined that is not Simone.  Now the search for the victim's identity is on.  They find some additional items buried in the garden which might make the corpse from Nigerian descent.Jane follows up the ownership of home.  She interviews the prior owner, theAllens and finds out that the house was a rental.  The tenant at the time was David Harvey but he is nowhere to be found.  Jane tracks him down on a hunch but Harvey has an alibi for the weekend.Enter DI Robert Oswalde (Colin Salmon), a black detective that Jane just had a fling with - that ended ugly.  He starts to follow up his own leads and finds a young Birmingham girl that went missing that weekend.  He meets the mother and brings her back to London.The have a facial reconstruction made from the skull.  They also know that there was a Reggae festival that weekend.  Tennison sends two detectives to interview the bands with the reconstruction to see if anyone can identify the victim.  This scores some videos of the festival and the girl is found as a backup singer for a band.The focus of the investigation turns to the Allen's son Tony (Fraser James).  He was visibly shaken by the clay head.  Further investigation shows that Tony and the victim, Joan were in the same band at Reggae Sunsplash and Tony's headmaster said that Tony's personality drastically changed the fall after the murder.Jane is still convinced that Harvey had something to do with the murders and continue to investigate him.  She is able to shake his alibi.As part two starts Tennison is interviewing Harvey and Oswalde is interrogating a distraught Tony Allen.  While being detained, Tony hangs himself causing another public relations nightmare.  But Tennison wonders what drove him to this.With both leads cold, Jane needs to find new leads.  When Sara mentions to Jane information about the murder that had not been released, Jane knows that Sara was there.  But her boss has made Sara out of bounds.  So Jane goes back to David Harvey's apartment and finds some incriminating photographs implicating his nephew Jason.Unlike American crime dramas, it doesn't end there.  And as for all the Prime Suspects, everything doesn't turn out well for Jane.Prime Suspect is the greatest collection of crime movies.  Everyone actor who wants to play a detective should study Helen Mirren's performance.  She is the greatest undiscovered actress of our time and this is her finest character.Lynda La Plante did not write this one but it surely has her style.  These films are not about who did it but how they get there.DVD EXTRAS: None",5,Mirren does it again,1137283200,"01 15, 2006",2006,3509,"['DCI', 'Jane', 'Tennison', 'back', 'Jane', 'knack', 'taking', 'clues', 'coming', 'up', 'right', 'solution', 'Unfortunately', 'when', 'always', 'not', 'enough', 'evidence', 'So', 'Jane', 'team', 'must', 'prove', 'case.This', 'round', 'girl', 'body', 'found', 'buried', 'garden', 'problem', 'decomposed', 'corps', 'description', 'Simone', 'Cameron', 'Also', 'complicating', 'things', 'brother', 'might', 'have', 'been', 'fitted', 'up', 'framed', 'murder', 'did', 'not', 'commit.The', 'inquiry', 'off', 'rocky', 'note', 'when', 'one', 'Inspectors', 'someone', 'possession', 'causing', 'quite', 'stir', 'neighborhood', 'Jane', 'Nola', 'Cameron', 'suspected', 'victim', 'mother', 'identify', 'corpse', 'possessions', 'Nola', 'everything', 'being', 'Simone', 'including', 'DCI', 'Tennison', 'watch', 'complicate', 'things', 'insects', 'found', 'corpse', 'put', 'murder', 'summer', 'when', 'Simone', 'went', 'missing', 'February.After', 'ME', 'remains', 'determined', 'not', 'Simone', 'Now', 'search', 'victim', 'identity', 'find', 'additional', 'items', 'buried', 'garden', 'might', 'make', 'corpse', 'Nigerian', 'descent.Jane', 'up', 'ownership', 'home', 'prior', 'owner', 'theAllens', 'out', 'house', 'was', 'rental', 'tenant', 'time', 'was', 'David', 'Harvey', 'nowhere', 'be', 'found', 'Jane', 'down', 'hunch', 'Harvey', 'alibi', 'weekend.Enter', 'DI', 'Robert', 'Oswalde', 'Colin', 'Salmon', 'black', 'detective', 'Jane', 'just', 'had', 'fling', 'ended', 'ugly', 'follow', 'up', 'own', 'leads', 'young', 'Birmingham', 'girl', 'went', 'missing', 'weekend', 'mother', 'back', 'London.The', 'have', 'facial', 'reconstruction', 'made', 'skull', 'also', 'know', 'was', 'Reggae', 'festival', 'weekend', 'Tennison', 'two', 'detectives', 'interview', 'bands', 'reconstruction', 'see', 'anyone', 'can', 'identify', 'victim', 'videos', 'festival', 'girl', 'found', 'backup', 'singer', 'band.The', 'focus', 'investigation', 'Allen', 'son', 'Tony', 'Fraser', 'James', 'was', 'visibly', 'shaken', 'clay', 'head', 'Further', 'investigation', 'Tony', 'victim', 'Joan', 'were', 'same', 'band', 'Reggae', 'Sunsplash', 'Tony', 'headmaster', 'said', 'Tony', 'personality', 'drastically', 'changed', 'fall', 'murder.Jane', 'still', 'convinced', 'Harvey', 'had', 'something', 'do', 'murders', 'continue', 'investigate', 'able', 'shake', 'alibi.As', 'part', 'two', 'starts', 'Tennison', 'interviewing', 'Harvey', 'Oswalde', 'interrogating', 'distraught', 'Tony', 'Allen', 'being', 'detained', 'Tony', 'causing', 'public', 'relations', 'nightmare', 'Tennison', 'what', 'drove', 'this.With', 'leads', 'cold', 'Jane', 'find', 'new', 'leads', 'When', 'Sara', 'mentions', 'Jane', 'information', 'murder', 'had', 'not', 'been', 'released', 'Jane', 'Sara', 'was', 'there', 'boss', 'made', 'Sara', 'bounds', 'So', 'Jane', 'back', 'David', 'Harvey', 'apartment', 'incriminating', 'photographs', 'implicating', 'nephew', 'Jason.Unlike', 'American', 'crime', 'dramas', ""n't"", 'end', 'there', 'Prime', 'Suspects', 'everything', ""n't"", 'turn', 'out', 'well', 'Jane.Prime', 'Suspect', 'greatest', 'collection', 'crime', 'movies', 'Everyone', 'actor', 'who', 'play', 'detective', 'should', 'study', 'Helen', 'Mirren', 'performance', 'greatest', 'undiscovered', 'actress', 'time', 'finest', 'character.Lynda', 'La', 'Plante', 'did', 'not', 'write', 'one', 'surely', 'style', 'films', 'are', 'not', 'who', 'did', 'how', 'get', 'there.DVD', 'EXTRAS', 'None']",N/A
