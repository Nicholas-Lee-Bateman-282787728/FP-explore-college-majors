The cast, though, is fun and they work together well, so I overlooked what I didn't like and have enjoyed the show. I have seen a couple of the current season's episodes On Demand. I'm disappointed that Alexis moved in with her boyfriend, and in the couple of episodes I've seen she's not as likeable as in the earlier seasons, but I'll stick with it for one more season to see what happens. The storylines are still interesting and the interaction between Beckett, Castle, and the rest of the cast is still fun to watch, so I think it'll be worth the price to preorder this one.

1672925,AM0Q2JUS910ZQ,B00FR23QNE,"JEROME W, MARTIN","[0, 0]","I waited all summer (very anxiously) to see what would happen after Castle proposed to Beckett; I wasn't disappointed.  Somereally great episodes in this season and anyone who was a Castle fan but did not watch this series 6  missed some really goodones.  The finally was an aggravating yet very interesting hanger; Now I have to fuss all summer to see how Castle, who wascertainly kidnapped by the Mob, gets out this one.  Hopefully they will get on with the marriage who everyone I know is anxious tosee; I wonder, though, if they are going to live with Martha.  I hope not; I cannot stand that Moocher even though she is Castlesmother.  Besides it is not a good idea for newlyweds to live with inlaws, though Alexi is fine.  Thank god she got rid of Cow Pi: whatan obnoxious creepo!!  She would later admit Castle was right in dissing him.  Cow Pi reminds me of Dr Sweets..Ick!!Why I wonder  Beckett took a job in the Attorney Generals office, especially with Eric Holder as AG.  Good Grief, she might as wellworked for the Mafia.  Anyhow, had it been the FBI, that would have been fine.  But now she is back with the NYPD; not a badpolice force to work for;  I live in NY and think they do a fine job.  I had worked for the city, but in Transit. Throughout the seasonthere is the typical Castle humor and good police stories; I just wonder, however, when they get hitched will we lose the littlesniping between them which led to laughs.  Anyhow, I ordered the DVD for this season from Amazon, but am keeping theepisodes in my Video Library until it comes.  Five stars I give; Becketts beautiful eyes deserve that alone!!

1672927,A35Q0RBM3YNQNF,B00FR23QNE,M. Hill,"[15, 19]","This is a show I like but after season 3 it has been a disappointing combination of what seems like filler episodes, with a couple of shining moments scattered here and there. It is the appreciation I have for the cast that keeps me watching and perhaps hope that some of the old magic from the first three seasons will be recaptured. Largely, this season felt like a lot of missed opportunities.The season finale disappointed not because I wanted a clique conclusion, but because the entire episode had Beckett fight to earn a happy ending only to lose out in the end. It felt like a poke in the eye -- just my opinion although fan dissension may have played a part in the recent removal of the original showrunner.Normally I buy the DVD sets for this show, but a heretofore unavailable extended bedroom scene from the season 4 Always episode between the two leads was presented by the former showrunner at an October 2013 Texas film festival. This is a scene not included in the season 4 DVD set bonus features. This development has made me wonder if a number of other previously unseen scenes and extra features may be bundled into a large complete series DVD package once the show is off the air. So, rather than risk buying the same basic thing twice, I think I'll wait to see what is made available then.Update June 2014: Now we know generally what will be on the season six DVD set which I've detailed below. A mysterious season 4 to date un-aired scene is scheduled to be included and hopefully it is the one mentioned in the above paragraph. Perhaps the fans were heard.Since the episodes are readily available for viewing in a number of places (syndication, Amazon, etc.) the main reason to purchase the DVD set is usually the bonus features. If history repeats itself, these features are usually posted by ABC on you tube a month or so prior to the availability of DVD set - perhaps to generate buzz -- but if in doubt, first watch them there.The bonus features for Season six will be spread out on all five of the discs. Disc one will include commentary by Jon Huertas and Seamus Dever in character as Detective Javier Esposito and Kevin Ryan for the Need to Know episode. There will also be deleted scenes on the disc.Disc two will include audio commentary for The Good, the Bad and the Baby episode from John Terlesky (director,) writer Terri Edda Miller, Nathan Fillion and Seamus Dever.Disc three will include audio commentary for the Deep Cover episode with writer Terrence Paul Winter, Nathan Fillion, Susan Sullivan and James Brolin. There will also be deleted scenes on the disc.Disc four will include audio commentary for In The Belly of The Beast episode with former showrunner Andrew Marlowe, writer David Amann and director Rob Bowman. The disc also includes deleted scenes and a longer performance of Seamus Dever singing ""What I Like About You"" from The Way of the Ninja episode.Disc five will include a feature a day in the life of Stana Katic on the Castle set with some attention paid to the final episode of the season. The entire cast reveals things they like about the show intersecting with fans responses from social media. The former showrunner and his wife discuss things they like about the show. There are bloopers and deleted scenes.Also, disc 5 will include an un-aired season four scene from the finale that was not shown. It is conjectured that this is the missing scene mentioned above that caused dischord among some fans after it was shown to a small group during a Texas workshop hosted by the former showrunner and his wife. It is odd to release a season four scene on the season six DVD release, so hopefully it is that significant scene.

1672928,ANW7ZQSOJQ2A7,B00FR23QNE,"Richard Muller ""old school audiologist""","[70, 74]","Yes, Season Six is still showing on your favorite ABC Network, and the overall rating is still 5 Stars!  Great writing, wonderful chemistry with ALL the main characters, and a surprise guest star or two from time to time make it one of the best things on TV.  Richard Castle (actually Richard Alexander Rogers) is still in the process of making Det. Kate Beckett the third Mrs. Castle, and it is, at last, no secret.The plots are realistic.  A lot of what is shown could be on the front page any day of the week.  The handling of the cases goes by Police proceedure, at least most of the time.  Allowances are made for Castle's ability to think ""outside the box"", which, for a murder mystery writer is what got this whole thing started.  And Det. Beckett seems to be on the same wavelength - most of the time.  A lot of what makes this show work so well is the wit.  A handful of dry humor goes a long way.  There is also plenty of pun-ishment!  For  homicide Detectives there is plenty of danger, so it is not by accident that they get in some serious positions, not conducive to good health.  Richard Castle gets a lot of his ""grounding"" through a very caring, loyal and wonderful family.  Susan Sullivan is just wonderful as Marsha Rogers, his mom.  The heartbreaking beauty of Alexis Castle, his only offspring so far, is very teenager-angst ridden, but very smart; and so well done by Molly Quinn.  Castle is also reminded of the past by two ex-wives, one of whom is his publlsher, no less!  Early on we see Castle give up the supposed job of creating three James Bond novels to remain at the 12th percinct to further pursue Kate Beckett.  After 5 full Seasons and a lot of #6, there could be just too much to go over, so this is a sort of synopsis of the series.  I was working hours that didn't allow me to see the original shows first-hand, so it was through time-shifting, huiu and finally re-runs on TNT that allowed me to get hooked on this show.  I remembered Nathan Fillion from ""firefly"" and ""Serenity"", and so at least he was a known quantity.  But Stana Katic was a very pleasant surprise!  She alludes to a certain sexuality, but also a street-wise earthiness that is just the right balance for an NYPD Officer.  She guards many secrets, which baffles and confounds Castle at the outset, but a lot of it is realized in the first 3 seasons and at a breakneck pace!  This show doesn't stop for much of a break, ever; but it also flows so well that even in quieter times it holds your interest.  Above the danger of the chase, there is always a home for Castle to return to, and if quirky Mom doesn't have a problem then it is Alexis going-off-to-college-or-not that will keep him on his toes.  If I had to make an analogy of this to other shows of the genre, I would say it is like ""Moonlighting"" on Steroids!  The writing never falters, and that is one BIG reason that this show keeps coming on!The loss of Steven J. Cannell so early on was certainlyh a blow to creator Andrew W. Marlowe, who had these wonderful weekly poker games with Castle and an actual James Patterson and Michael Connelly sitting in.  The ultimate writer's block-breakers!  (I would urge you to get the Season One DVD package for its wonderful look into the life of Steven J. Cannell, who bought so many years of unrivaled entertainment to your TV screen!)  None of the seasons should be missed, as there is something in there for just about anyone.Also, for you Mums and Dads, there is not the gruesome exposure to death's aftermath that so many (CSI, NCIS) others show.  So the Double-Digit kids in the family can enjoy this along with you!  I will offer up no spoilers -- but I will say this: the end of Season #4 and the beginning of Season #5 are not to be missed!  I think that if this wonderful comedy/drama goes on for at least two or three more years, I would not be surprised.  And I will have enjoyed many years of a great show!  You will to, if you get busy -- and ready for Season #6's release in the Spring of 2014 ...",5,Still in your home theater...,1388102400,"12 27, 2013",2013,4021,"['Yes', 'Season', 'Six', 'still', 'showing', 'favorite', 'ABC', 'Network', 'overall', 'rating', 'still', '5', 'Stars', 'Great', 'writing', 'wonderful', 'chemistry', 'main', 'characters', 'surprise', 'guest', 'star', 'two', 'time', 'time', 'make', 'one', 'best', 'things', 'TV', 'Richard', 'Castle', 'actually', 'Richard', 'Alexander', 'Rogers', 'still', 'process', 'making', 'Det', 'Kate', 'Beckett', 'third', 'Mrs.', 'Castle', 'last', 'secret.The', 'plots', 'are', 'realistic', 'lot', 'what', 'shown', 'could', 'be', 'front', 'page', 'day', 'week', 'handling', 'cases', 'Police', 'proceedure', 'least', 'most', 'time', 'Allowances', 'are', 'made', 'Castle', 'ability', 'think', 'box', 'murder', 'mystery', 'writer', 'what', 'got', 'whole', 'thing', 'started', 'Det', 'Beckett', 'be', 'same', 'wavelength', 'most', 'time', 'lot', 'what', 'show', 'work', 'so', 'well', 'wit', 'handful', 'dry', 'humor', 'long', 'way', 'also', 'plenty', 'pun-ishment', 'homicide', 'Detectives', 'plenty', 'danger', 'not', 'accident', 'get', 'serious', 'positions', 'not', 'conducive', 'good', 'health', 'Richard', 'Castle', 'lot', 'grounding', 'very', 'caring', 'loyal', 'wonderful', 'family', 'Susan', 'Sullivan', 'just', 'wonderful', 'Marsha', 'Rogers', 'mom', 'heartbreaking', 'beauty', 'Alexis', 'Castle', 'only', 'offspring', 'so', 'far', 'very', 'teenager-angst', 'ridden', 'very', 'smart', 'so', 'well', 'done', 'Molly', 'Quinn', 'Castle', 'also', 'reminded', 'past', 'two', 'ex-wives', 'one', 'whom', 'publlsher', 'less', 'Early', 'see', 'Castle', 'give', 'up', 'supposed', 'job', 'creating', 'three', 'James', 'Bond', 'novels', 'remain', '12th', 'percinct', 'further', 'pursue', 'Kate', 'Beckett', '5', 'full', 'Seasons', 'lot', '6', 'could', 'be', 'just', 'too', 'much', 'go', 'over', 'so', 'sort', 'synopsis', 'series', 'was', 'working', 'hours', 'did', ""n't"", 'allow', 'see', 'original', 'shows', 'first-hand', 'was', 'time-shifting', 'huiu', 'finally', 're-runs', 'TNT', 'allowed', 'get', 'hooked', 'show', 'remembered', 'Nathan', 'Fillion', 'firefly', 'Serenity', 'so', 'least', 'was', 'known', 'quantity', 'Stana', 'Katic', 'was', 'very', 'pleasant', 'surprise', 'certain', 'sexuality', 'also', 'street-wise', 'earthiness', 'just', 'right', 'balance', 'NYPD', 'Officer', 'guards', 'many', 'secrets', 'Castle', 'outset', 'lot', 'realized', 'first', '3', 'seasons', 'breakneck', 'pace', 'show', ""n't"", 'stop', 'much', 'break', 'ever', 'also', 'so', 'well', 'even', 'quieter', 'times', 'interest', 'danger', 'chase', 'always', 'home', 'Castle', 'return', 'quirky', 'Mom', ""n't"", 'have', 'problem', 'then', 'Alexis', 'going-off-to-college-or-not', 'will', 'keep', 'toes', 'had', 'make', 'analogy', 'other', 'shows', 'genre', 'would', 'say', 'Moonlighting', 'Steroids', 'writing', 'never', 'falters', 'one', 'BIG', 'reason', 'show', 'coming', 'loss', 'Steven', 'J.', 'Cannell', 'so', 'early', 'was', 'certainlyh', 'blow', 'creator', 'Andrew', 'W.', 'Marlowe', 'who', 'had', 'wonderful', 'weekly', 'poker', 'games', 'Castle', 'actual', 'James', 'Patterson', 'Michael', 'Connelly', 'sitting', 'ultimate', 'writer', 'block-breakers', 'would', 'urge', 'get', 'Season', 'One', 'DVD', 'package', 'wonderful', 'look', 'life', 'Steven', 'J.', 'Cannell', 'who', 'bought', 'so', 'many', 'years', 'unrivaled', 'entertainment', 'TV', 'screen', 'None', 'seasons', 'should', 'be', 'missed', 'something', 'just', 'anyone.Also', 'Mums', 'Dads', 'not', 'gruesome', 'exposure', 'death', 'aftermath', 'so', 'many', 'CSI', 'NCIS', 'others', 'show', 'Double-Digit', 'kids', 'family', 'can', 'enjoy', 'will', 'offer', 'up', 'spoilers', 'will', 'say', 'end', 'Season', '4', 'beginning', 'Season', '5', 'are', 'not', 'be', 'missed', 'think', 'wonderful', 'comedy/drama', 'least', 'two', 'three', 'more', 'years', 'would', 'not', 'be', 'surprised', 'will', 'have', 'enjoyed', 'many', 'years', 'great', 'show', 'will', 'get', 'busy', 'ready', 'Season', '6', 'release', 'Spring', '2014']",Castle: Season 6
