1238531,A3EUSH8DPW75LR,B001U9BRNE,barry,"[31, 31]","I saw this concert when it was on PBS and thought it was superb.  When it was released as a cd/dvd combo I was intrigued but cautious.  The cd had just a few songs and I have a blu ray player.  Thank God I waited for here it is on blu ray and it is spellbinding, using blu ray and all its capabilities to their full effect.The video is crytal clear, crisp with vibrant colors.  The thing that is truly amazing here is the audio.  The menu just shows a 5.1 surround option but be sure to go thru the audio options on your blu ray remote for there is a spectacular lossless DTS-HD Master Audio 5.1 option.  This is reason enough to purchase this concert.  I don't understand why they don't show this option on the menu or on the case.  The music will soar out of your theater system.  Spoken word as well as singing and instrumental are all stunning.The concert itself deserves the highest accolades.  There is almost 2 1/2 hours here of music.  It t is the perfect mix of conversation between David and each artist with the majority of the time being given to the music.  And it is music of the highest caliber.  Everyone will have some favorites here but each artist is in top form and each performance is perfection.  I didn't fast forward through any part of this.  My personal favorite is Katharine McPhee's powerful performance of SOMEWHERE and spellbinding duet with Andrea Bocelli on THE PRAYER.  I am also a huge Michael Buble fan and his charm and talent are put on full display here.  Kenny G, Josh Groban and Boz Scaggs are all superb.  I had never heard Blake Shelton before and I am a new fan.  I also got to relive my disco days with the amazing vocals of Cheryl Lynn on GOT TO BE REAL.This concert is a production of total class from beginning to end.  Each artist is given their time in the spotlight.  David Foster shows grace and true humility as his full musical legacy is displayed.  This concert is a must have and if you have blu ray you will be astonished at its visual and vocal beauty.  Even if you already have the dvd it is worth double dipping to get the glorious blu ray.  And if you don't have blu ray then you must get the dvd.Enjoy this must have concert.  It is a definite treat you will watch over and over.",5,Excellent concert superb in blu ray with amazing hidden audio track,1239408000,"04 11, 2009",2009,2240,"['saw', 'concert', 'when', 'was', 'PBS', 'thought', 'was', 'superb', 'When', 'was', 'released', 'cd/dvd', 'combo', 'was', 'intrigued', 'cautious', 'cd', 'had', 'just', 'few', 'songs', 'have', 'blu', 'ray', 'player', 'Thank', 'God', 'waited', 'here', 'blu', 'ray', 'spellbinding', 'using', 'blu', 'ray', 'capabilities', 'full', 'effect.The', 'video', 'crytal', 'clear', 'crisp', 'vibrant', 'colors', 'thing', 'truly', 'amazing', 'here', 'audio', 'menu', 'just', '5.1', 'surround', 'option', 'be', 'sure', 'go', 'thru', 'audio', 'options', 'blu', 'ray', 'remote', 'spectacular', 'lossless', 'DTS-HD', 'Master', 'Audio', '5.1', 'option', 'reason', 'enough', 'purchase', 'concert', 'do', ""n't"", 'understand', 'why', 'do', ""n't"", 'show', 'option', 'menu', 'case', 'music', 'will', 'soar', 'theater', 'system', 'Spoken', 'word', 'as', 'well', 'singing', 'instrumental', 'are', 'stunning.The', 'concert', 'highest', 'accolades', 'almost', '2', '1/2', 'hours', 'here', 'music', 'perfect', 'mix', 'conversation', 'David', 'artist', 'majority', 'time', 'being', 'given', 'music', 'music', 'highest', 'caliber', 'Everyone', 'will', 'have', 'favorites', 'here', 'artist', 'top', 'form', 'performance', 'perfection', 'did', ""n't"", 'fast', 'forward', 'part', 'personal', 'favorite', 'Katharine', 'McPhee', 'powerful', 'performance', 'SOMEWHERE', 'spellbinding', 'duet', 'Andrea', 'Bocelli', 'THE', 'PRAYER', 'am', 'also', 'huge', 'Michael', 'Buble', 'fan', 'charm', 'talent', 'are', 'put', 'full', 'display', 'here', 'Kenny', 'G', 'Josh', 'Groban', 'Boz', 'Scaggs', 'are', 'superb', 'had', 'never', 'heard', 'Blake', 'Shelton', 'am', 'new', 'fan', 'also', 'got', 'relive', 'disco', 'days', 'amazing', 'vocals', 'Cheryl', 'Lynn', 'GOT', 'TO', 'BE', 'REAL.This', 'concert', 'production', 'total', 'class', 'beginning', 'end', 'artist', 'given', 'time', 'spotlight', 'David', 'Foster', 'grace', 'true', 'humility', 'full', 'musical', 'legacy', 'displayed', 'concert', 'must', 'have', 'have', 'blu', 'ray', 'will', 'be', 'astonished', 'visual', 'vocal', 'beauty', 'Even', 'already', 'have', 'dvd', 'worth', 'double', 'dipping', 'get', 'glorious', 'blu', 'ray', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'blu', 'ray', 'then', 'must', 'get', 'dvd.Enjoy', 'must', 'have', 'concert', 'definite', 'treat', 'will', 'watch']",N/A

The video and audio quality of this BD is top notch and you'll not be disappointed in that arena.But the concert itself i found very nuaseating which is why i gave the overall 3-stars. David Foster kept on saying ""I....I.....I"", endlessly talking about his accomplishments ad-nauseum. I mean, it was as though he put on a concert to remind people how wonderful and brilliant he was at creating all the music hits of the 80s and 90s in all musical styles. It really felt like a eulogy that he was giving himself!!! This is what turned me off the whole concert. Your friends and colleagues are supposed to give you the praise and speak nice and wonderful things about you and what you've done for them in their lives.

I am watching it on a 210"" hd projector system and so the picture has got to be there for me. I started ordering concerts from Netflix for a demo to see if they are worthy of purchasing and not just a money toss- which for the past few months I have been thanking Netflix for saving me lots money! Read the reviews both here on Amazon and on Netflix and had this one in the ""Q"". I just received the blue-ray several hours ago in the mail from Netflix and told my wife, well this could be over in 5 minutes........ well that was over 2.5 hours ago.OK, I will admit that I did not know the real history of David's work, what rock was I under? But as most of the posts noted, I was beyond stunned- speechless- and then a little 16 year girl came out named Charice, I then just lost my breath too. I just ordered it in blue-ray to add to my collection (Thanks Amazon!)Video for a concert- 5 stars, details and camera work are always difficult for concerts but this was pulled together nicely, reminds me of Sting with the RPO in Blue-raySound in DTS-HD, again,,, I just lost my breath, incredible balance and with such an array of signers,, WOW! 8 stars!!!!I am not writing this review to get thumbs up approval but to ensure people out there, like me that kinda look at concerts with a grain of salt- until proven.... Well I hope you have a good sound system cause you WILL BE TESTING THE HELL OUT OF IT'S LIMITS. You could just tell how each artist was really pushing their levels and still just having a great time.

Disco, rock, country, jazz, new age and more. 18 big artists participate in it, and not any one, I'm talking about great singers who gives in this concert a fantastic performance. There are some new incredible talented such as Katharine Mcfee, Michael Johns and a filipine 16 years old girl Charise, It's incredible how this child sings (I'm not exaggerating when I say this girl sang the Whitney Houston's songs flawless).

1238552,A3QLAOOTFEHCJI,B001U9BRNE,M. Oleson,"[0, 0]","David Foster put this event together for Andre Agassi and his foundation.  Foster has such a wide breadth of musicians that began under his tutelage he rarely has a problem getting them to perform for him.  Here we have heavyweights aplenty including Bocelli, Dion, Buble, Groban and Shelton to go along with older stars like Scaggs, Cetera, Kenny G and newcomers Johns, Olstead, McPhee and Charice and smooth jazzers McKnight, Lynn, Benet and Babyface.  Foster's introductions go from awe to his characteristic ""wow"" for every performer.  While it often sounds syrupy sweet I have to think he's very genuine.Usually with these benefit collaborations, there are more misses than hits but that's not the case here.  I do think the video smooches by Barbra Streisand and Kevin Costner grinded the event to a halt, but Foster gives them a quick thanks and gets things moving again.  I also though Celine Dion stopping her own Vegas show to do a bit with Foster seemed a bit uncomfortable.  Otherwise, every performer here gave it his or her all.  Who would have thought Katherine McPhee could keep up with Bocelli?  Blake Shelton and Michael Buble perform a duet of ""Home"" a hit for both.  For a show stopper check out 16 year old Charice make Whitney Houston fans take notice.  If you like any of these performers you should appreciate this concert.This is the second time I've watched this Blu ray disc and a couple things surprised me.  First, this is a rare release in 1080i, but there was no issue with the transfer.  It's beautiful. Pleanty of sparkle and black blacks.  The other is the sound.  I was watching this video with a new receiver and in a different environment than usual.  I was amazed at how good the disc sounded.
