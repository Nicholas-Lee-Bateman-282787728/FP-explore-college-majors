Because it didn't fit into any of their simplistic demographic segments, they threw it in the action category simply because the cover and the opening sequence demonstrates a man swinging a talwar. It's a bit like ""Saw"" being classified as a power tool instructional video.Let's get this out of the way now: This is not an action movie. If you rent this looking for swashbuckling you will be sorely disappointed.Now on to what the movie is really about:The movie is the physical and emotional journey of a man's conscience from court executioner to pacifist. It follows the story of the king's executioner. While leading a death squad on a rampage through a village, he has an epiphany, and decides to never lift a sword again.While it is not an action movie, it is about violence and its consequences. As he tries to make amends and become a better person, the ramifications of his past follow the warrior in his wake, becoming the main villain of the story.The movie was filmed on location in Northern India, and the backdrops are breathtaking. Most of the cast are non-actors (hence the intentional lack of scripted dialogue), but the cast are able to convey so much without a single word, especially the warrior himself. In recent cinema, only Viggo Mortensen in ""A History of Violence"" was able to communicate such a complex emotional transformation with just a single look.It all makes for a highly moving parable about redemption. And this is a movie I would recommend especially for war veterans or retired soldiers.",4,"A movie about violence, not action",1160870400,"10 15, 2006",2006,1652,"['marketing', 'movie', 'latest', 'shining', 'example', 'Hollywood', 'narrow-minded', 'marketing', 'execs', 'bungling', 'opportunity', 'did', ""n't"", 'fit', 'simplistic', 'demographic', 'segments', 'threw', 'action', 'category', 'simply', 'cover', 'opening', 'sequence', 'man', 'swinging', 'talwar', 'bit', 'Saw', 'being', 'classified', 'power', 'tool', 'instructional', 'video.Let', 'get', 'out', 'way', 'now', 'not', 'action', 'movie', 'rent', 'looking', 'swashbuckling', 'will', 'be', 'sorely', 'disappointed.Now', 'what', 'movie', 'really', 'movie', 'physical', 'emotional', 'journey', 'man', 'conscience', 'court', 'executioner', 'pacifist', 'story', 'king', 'executioner', 'leading', 'death', 'squad', 'rampage', 'village', 'epiphany', 'never', 'lift', 'sword', 'not', 'action', 'movie', 'violence', 'consequences', 'make', 'amends', 'become', 'better', 'person', 'ramifications', 'past', 'follow', 'warrior', 'wake', 'becoming', 'main', 'villain', 'story.The', 'movie', 'was', 'filmed', 'location', 'Northern', 'India', 'backdrops', 'are', 'breathtaking', 'Most', 'cast', 'are', 'non-actors', 'hence', 'intentional', 'lack', 'scripted', 'dialogue', 'cast', 'are', 'able', 'convey', 'so', 'much', 'single', 'word', 'especially', 'warrior', 'recent', 'cinema', 'only', 'Viggo', 'Mortensen', 'A', 'History', 'Violence', 'was', 'able', 'communicate', 'such', 'complex', 'emotional', 'transformation', 'just', 'single', 'look.It', 'highly', 'moving', 'parable', 'redemption', 'movie', 'would', 'recommend', 'especially', 'war', 'veterans', 'retired', 'soldiers']",N/A
970534,A3KF4IP2MUS8QQ,B000E8NRV2,"Daniel Jolley ""darkgenius""","[15, 16]","The Warrior is a subtly powerful, beautifully shot movie that carries with it a rare quality of importance.  It's a deep, conflicting story that plays strangely on the emotions, relies on disarmingly sparse dialogue, and leaves an indelible impression on the viewer.  It garnered a number of nominations and awards, including the Alexander Korda Award for Best British Film (the film's director/co-writer, Asif Kapadia, is British, as were several others involved in the production), even though it was denied Oscar consideration as the British entry for best foreign language film because it was in the non-English language of Hindi.  Since it is in Hindi, you can expect to depend on subtitles - but the poignancy and real depth of the story is really revealed through the faces of the actors and actresses.The Warrior is the story of Lafcadia (Irfan Khan), a warrior in feudal India who, in something of a spiritual moment, lays down his sword and swears to never kill again.  Hurrying home, he cuts his hair and that of his son and sets off on a journey ""home"" to the mountains.  His feudal lord, naturally, disapproves of any man leaving his service and demands his head by the next morning.  This leads to a momentous turning point I found quite shocking.  It's a little hard to sympathize with a man who has the blood of countless men, women, and children (most of them guilty of nothing other than poverty) on his hands, but the tragic events that quickly play out really connect you to this man on an emotional level as he begins his trek from the deserts of Rajasthan to the snowbound Himalayas.  Along the way, he meets a young thief named Riaz (Noor Mani), who follows and eventually taps into his shell-shocked character, and an old blind woman who easily picks up on the life he is trying to put behind him.Lafcadia's journey is a spiritual quest of sorts, an attempt to put his murderous past and emotional trauma behind him and find some sort of peace with himself.  A warrior's past proves difficult to dispose of, however, as the men who were his fellow warriors continue to pursue him, cutting a bloody swath through several villages along the way toward an inevitable confrontation.I'm afraid some individuals will see the title and expect a film full of great battles and heroic deeds.  While there are a few moments of violence and bloodshed on display here, the film is actually a slow-moving, poignant drama that action-seekers may well consider boring.  A lot of The Warrior involves a man walking, several minutes can pass without a word of dialogue being spoken, and the ending may not fully click for those who don't make a necessary connection with an earlier moment in the film.  I think The Warrior is a fantastic film that succeeds on a most challenging level, thanks in no small part to the deeply impressive performance of Irfan Khan, which means I apparently agree with movie critics for once.",5,A superlative film of great emotional depth,1151712000,"07 1, 2006",2006,2928,"['Warrior', 'subtly', 'powerful', 'beautifully', 'shot', 'movie', 'rare', 'quality', 'importance', 'deep', 'conflicting', 'story', 'strangely', 'emotions', 'relies', 'disarmingly', 'sparse', 'dialogue', 'indelible', 'impression', 'viewer', 'garnered', 'number', 'nominations', 'awards', 'including', 'Alexander', 'Korda', 'Award', 'Best', 'British', 'Film', 'film', 'director/co-writer', 'Asif', 'Kapadia', 'British', 'were', 'several', 'others', 'involved', 'production', 'even', 'was', 'denied', 'Oscar', 'consideration', 'British', 'entry', 'best', 'foreign', 'language', 'film', 'was', 'non-English', 'language', 'Hindi', 'Hindi', 'can', 'expect', 'depend', 'subtitles', 'poignancy', 'real', 'depth', 'story', 'really', 'revealed', 'actors', 'actresses.The', 'Warrior', 'story', 'Lafcadia', 'Irfan', 'Khan', 'warrior', 'feudal', 'India', 'who', 'something', 'spiritual', 'moment', 'down', 'sword', 'swears', 'never', 'kill', 'again', 'Hurrying', 'home', 'hair', 'son', 'sets', 'off', 'journey', 'home', 'mountains', 'feudal', 'lord', 'naturally', 'disapproves', 'man', 'leaving', 'service', 'head', 'next', 'morning', 'momentous', 'turning', 'point', 'found', 'quite', 'shocking', 'little', 'hard', 'sympathize', 'man', 'who', 'blood', 'countless', 'men', 'women', 'children', 'most', 'guilty', 'nothing', 'other', 'poverty', 'hands', 'tragic', 'events', 'quickly', 'play', 'out', 'really', 'connect', 'man', 'emotional', 'level', 'trek', 'deserts', 'Rajasthan', 'snowbound', 'Himalayas', 'way', 'young', 'thief', 'named', 'Riaz', 'Noor', 'Mani', 'who', 'eventually', 'taps', 'shell-shocked', 'character', 'old', 'blind', 'woman', 'who', 'easily', 'up', 'life', 'trying', 'put', 'him.Lafcadia', 'journey', 'spiritual', 'quest', 'sorts', 'attempt', 'put', 'murderous', 'past', 'emotional', 'trauma', 'find', 'sort', 'peace', 'warrior', 'past', 'proves', 'difficult', 'dispose', 'however', 'men', 'who', 'were', 'fellow', 'warriors', 'continue', 'pursue', 'cutting', 'bloody', 'swath', 'several', 'villages', 'way', 'inevitable', 'confrontation.I', ""'m"", 'afraid', 'individuals', 'will', 'see', 'title', 'expect', 'film', 'full', 'great', 'battles', 'heroic', 'deeds', 'are', 'few', 'moments', 'violence', 'bloodshed', 'display', 'here', 'film', 'actually', 'slow-moving', 'poignant', 'drama', 'action-seekers', 'may', 'well', 'consider', 'boring', 'lot', 'Warrior', 'man', 'walking', 'several', 'minutes', 'can', 'pass', 'word', 'dialogue', 'being', 'spoken', 'ending', 'may', 'not', 'fully', 'click', 'who', 'do', ""n't"", 'make', 'necessary', 'connection', 'earlier', 'moment', 'film', 'think', 'Warrior', 'fantastic', 'film', 'most', 'challenging', 'level', 'thanks', 'small', 'part', 'deeply', 'impressive', 'performance', 'Irfan', 'Khan', 'apparently', 'agree', 'movie', 'critics', 'once']",N/A

There was commentary and that's it. I started to listen to the commentary but couldn't handle the dullness of that.

970536,AN0VOJ255J2V5,B000E8NRV2,James Fairchild,"[0, 0]","I teach a course at my University about films that either promote peace or have a peaceful subject, and this film is ideal. The ""warrior"" is a man who works for a local lord, raping, killing, and pillaging those who don't or can't pay the lord tribute. It's a little like a Mafia protection racket set in 18th century India. The film never directly shows the blood-spattering violence, but there's enough footage to fuel the imagination. Early on in a moment of extraordinary insight the hero vows never to lift another sword. However, the lord has other ideas and sends the same killers after him that he had previously led. One of the beauties of the film is the way the hero deals with these deadly assassins without resorting to violence. After the initial incidents, the movie turns into a road trip, with the hero encountering many fascinating characters and adventures along the way, but the action is never superficial or unnecessary. The characterization is wonderful, and the director uses a real blind woman to play a sort of blind sage whom the hero meets in his travels and wants to protect. The filmmakers have generously supplied one of the best Special Feature presentations of any DVD I've watched, which lays out in detail how it was made and is as enjoyable as the film itself. The stories about the blind woman and the street kid hired to act in the film are really touching.

It wasn't what I expected. The warrior turns out to be more of a killer or assasin. The story is of a man that kills for a rich lord. The lord has power over who lives and dies. A village does not give enough to suit the lord so he sends the ""warrior""along with the other killers to teach a lesson by burning and killing and raping. While in the village he almost kills a young girl until he sees a necklace that belonged to his son on the girl. He knows that his son must have given it to the girl and so he drops his sword. This was enough to make him realize that killing innocent people is wrong. He rides off leaving the other warriors in the village. From then on he is on the run to escape his past. He meets many people on the journey and how he interacts with them is quite interesting and compeling. You can't miss any of the movie because there are things along the way that will have meaning later on in the story.The journey is from the desert to the Himalayas and the cinematography is excellent. Acting is very good. Not a lot of dialog. The audience is required to piece together much of the story. It is subtitled but is easily read. The words are put in the outside of the letterbox against a black background. The story could be found to be boring to some. It is not your action type movie.
