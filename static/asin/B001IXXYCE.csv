1204693,A1C2FD1DZKR4W0,B001IXXYCE,J. HARMON,"[27, 36]","CHEERS... my all-time favorite television show. Without question without peer. This show started off at the bottom and quickly endeared itself to the nation until it reached the number one slot on television.Carla (Rhea Perlman) is the only actor who is less than stellar, but her character is so overwrought with zaniness that the acting matters not. Cliff (John Ratzenberger) created himself into one of the most well-known and well-spoofed of characters in television lore. Is it a coincidence that the demise of our U.S. Postal Service was inversely proportional to the increased popularity of this brainless two legged barstool? Norm (George Wendt)... got himself typecast into such a beloved role for which the actor would never wish to live down. (MARRIED WITH CHILDREN's own Al Bundy cannot compare to the character recognition of Mr. Wendt's ""Norm (Norman) Peterson."" Woodrow Tiberias Boyd (Ole ""Woodhead"" Woody Harrelson himself) and Coach (Nick Colasanto) complete the ensemble cast that (along with the leads of Sam Malone (Ted Danson), Diane ""Don't you think if I could have sent her to prison I would have"" Chambers (Shelley Long) and Rebecca (Backseat Becky/ Beck Beck as played by Kirstey Alley) gave life to a television show rarely matched before or since in comedic genius with heartwarming tenderness.Just watching George Wendt agrily chasing Cliff Clavin around the bar after having just been released from jail is worth the cost of this set. One needs only to watch a few episodes to recognize the genuine comradery that exists among most of the cast members (including the episode where in several spit balls are seen in Woody Harrelsons hair complements of George Wendts off-camera shenannigans.)This show remains nearly timeless with humor that holds up to modernity and maturity. Some writing gaffes occurred through the 11 seasons but none as egregious as those found on such notable NBC hit shows as FRIENDS and SEINFELD.CHEERS is truly MUST SEE TV.I only wish that there were bonus features to be found after the second season.

1204699,A392P34QSBUICZ,B001IXXYCE,"Robin Landry ""singer/songwriter""","[2, 6]","My husband and I have watched this series through twice now, and it makes us long for the days when television was about lovable characters, rubbing up against each other making us laugh in ways that we just don't get with more recent shows, that seem to delight in put-downs instead of good writing.  And don't even get me started on ""Reality T.V."" where humiliation is the name of the game, and if someone isn't having an emotional breakdown, it's just not entertaining.Cheers, if you haven't seen it yet, is about a lovable, alcoholic bartender, Sam Malone, who drinks himself out of a job, and a marriage, and ends up buying a bar.  His regulars include an accountant, Norm, who bemoans the fact that he has no life, yet his life is Cheers and his family is Sam,and the other patrons.  What's so charming about Norm is that everyone yells out 'Norm' when he walks into the bar, and when someone asks him how he'd doing, Norm always has a witty comeback, such as: ""how's life treating you?"" and Norm answers, ""it's a dog-eat-dog world, and I'm wearing milk bone underwear"".Next is Cliff, the mail man who sits next to Norm.  You just had to know that the writers came up with the name Cliff because Cliff knows a little something about everything, he's literally a Cliff Note, and will drone on and on until someone tells him to be quiet.Then there's Karla, an Italian spit-fire, and single mother of six kids, who has a biting comeback for most everyone, but especially Cliff and Diane the other waitresses.  Karla is half in love with Sam, so she resents Diane who is constantly leading Sam on and then shutting him down.And then there's Diane.  The bane of Sam's existence.  Sam, who possesses a black book of babes numbers that is sacred to Cliff and Norm, who live vicariously through Sam's exploits.  Sam, who is the player extraordinaire, falls for the pseudo intellectual Dianne whose certain her relationship with Sam in a backward step for her, even though her college professor boyfriend left her waiting at Cheers, when he ran off with his ex-wife.  Diane is so neurotic that she can't enjoy anything because she's too busy trying to prove how intelligent she is by quoting authors, poets and following anyone who might have more education than she has which is considerable.There's a psychiatrist named Frasier, who ended up with a spin-off show called Frasier, who plays a character who's supposed to be a healer, yet as we get to know Frasier, we realize that he's the one who's most in need of a good psychiatrist.  He falls for a fellow psychiatrist named Lilith, and again, the writers have named her after the first wife of Adam who is a she-demon, and Lilith with her pale skin, dark hair and no emotions, fits the part perfectly.Midway through the series, Diane is replaced by Rebbecca, and the first time Rebbecca comes through the door Sam is so flustered, he bursts out with ""she's almost as good looking as I am"".  Priceless.  Rebbecca is Sam in female form, and just as neurotic as Diane was.I can't recommend this series highly enough.  It's like a visit to your dysfunctional, yet warm and loving family where everyone supports each other through the good and the bad times.  It's funny in a good way, because the characters are well-drawn to the point of being real enough to feel like you could meet them one day on the street.  Sam, who is the focal point of the show is warm and loving, and really the father figure to the rest of the family, who look to him for guidance.  Sam plays the 'wounded hero' who tries to heal his family as best he can, giving the show an undercurrent of emotion that makes us feel good watching it.When I Dream",5,Must-see-tv,1303948800,"04 28, 2011",2011,3674,"['husband', 'have', 'watched', 'series', 'twice', 'now', 'long', 'days', 'when', 'television', 'was', 'lovable', 'characters', 'rubbing', 'up', 'other', 'making', 'ways', 'just', 'do', ""n't"", 'get', 'more', 'recent', 'shows', 'seem', 'delight', 'put-downs', 'instead', 'good', 'writing', 'do', ""n't"", 'even', 'get', 'started', 'Reality', 'T.V', 'where', 'humiliation', 'name', 'game', 'someone', ""n't"", 'having', 'emotional', 'breakdown', 'just', 'not', 'entertaining.Cheers', 'have', ""n't"", 'seen', 'yet', 'lovable', 'alcoholic', 'bartender', 'Sam', 'Malone', 'who', 'job', 'marriage', 'up', 'buying', 'bar', 'regulars', 'include', 'accountant', 'Norm', 'who', 'fact', 'life', 'life', 'Cheers', 'family', 'Sam', 'other', 'patrons', 'What', 'so', 'charming', 'Norm', 'everyone', 'out', ""'Norm"", 'when', 'bar', 'when', 'someone', 'how', ""'d"", 'doing', 'Norm', 'always', 'witty', 'comeback', 'such', 'how', 'life', 'treating', 'Norm', 'answers', 'dog-eat-dog', 'world', ""'m"", 'wearing', 'milk', 'bone', 'underwear', '.Next', 'Cliff', 'mail', 'man', 'who', 'next', 'Norm', 'just', 'had', 'know', 'writers', 'came', 'up', 'name', 'Cliff', 'Cliff', 'little', 'something', 'everything', 'literally', 'Cliff', 'Note', 'will', 'drone', 'someone', 'be', 'quiet.Then', 'Karla', 'Italian', 'spit-fire', 'single', 'mother', 'six', 'kids', 'who', 'biting', 'comeback', 'most', 'everyone', 'especially', 'Cliff', 'Diane', 'other', 'waitresses', 'Karla', 'half', 'love', 'Sam', 'Diane', 'who', 'constantly', 'leading', 'Sam', 'then', 'shutting', 'down.And', 'then', 'Diane', 'bane', 'Sam', 'existence', 'Sam', 'who', 'black', 'book', 'babes', 'numbers', 'sacred', 'Cliff', 'Norm', 'who', 'live', 'vicariously', 'Sam', 'exploits', 'Sam', 'who', 'player', 'extraordinaire', 'pseudo', 'intellectual', 'Dianne', 'certain', 'relationship', 'Sam', 'backward', 'step', 'even', 'college', 'professor', 'boyfriend', 'left', 'waiting', 'Cheers', 'when', 'ran', 'off', 'ex-wife', 'Diane', 'so', 'neurotic', 'ca', ""n't"", 'enjoy', 'anything', 'too', 'busy', 'trying', 'prove', 'how', 'intelligent', 'quoting', 'authors', 'poets', 'following', 'anyone', 'who', 'might', 'have', 'more', 'education', 'psychiatrist', 'named', 'Frasier', 'who', 'ended', 'up', 'spin-off', 'show', 'called', 'Frasier', 'who', 'character', 'who', 'supposed', 'be', 'healer', 'yet', 'get', 'know', 'Frasier', 'realize', 'one', 'who', 'most', 'need', 'good', 'psychiatrist', 'fellow', 'psychiatrist', 'named', 'Lilith', 'again', 'writers', 'have', 'named', 'first', 'wife', 'Adam', 'who', 'she-demon', 'Lilith', 'pale', 'skin', 'dark', 'hair', 'emotions', 'part', 'perfectly.Midway', 'series', 'Diane', 'replaced', 'Rebbecca', 'first', 'time', 'Rebbecca', 'door', 'Sam', 'so', 'flustered', 'out', 'almost', 'good', 'looking', 'am', 'Priceless', 'Rebbecca', 'Sam', 'female', 'form', 'just', 'as', 'neurotic', 'Diane', 'was.I', 'ca', ""n't"", 'recommend', 'series', 'highly', 'enough', 'visit', 'dysfunctional', 'warm', 'loving', 'family', 'where', 'everyone', 'other', 'good', 'bad', 'times', 'funny', 'good', 'way', 'characters', 'are', 'well-drawn', 'point', 'being', 'real', 'enough', 'feel', 'could', 'meet', 'one', 'day', 'street', 'Sam', 'who', 'focal', 'point', 'show', 'warm', 'loving', 'really', 'father', 'figure', 'rest', 'family', 'who', 'look', 'guidance', 'Sam', ""'wounded"", 'hero', 'who', 'heal', 'family', 'best', 'can', 'giving', 'show', 'undercurrent', 'emotion', 'feel', 'good', 'watching', 'it.When', 'Dream']",Cheers: The Complete Series
