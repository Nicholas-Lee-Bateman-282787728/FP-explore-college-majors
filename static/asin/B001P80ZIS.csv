The main actress (Shirley Henderson) really captures an unraveling emotional state.  I really loved the vicar (Shireen Shah) as well and the scenes between the two of them.,3,Death Whispers,1398211200,"04 23, 2014",2014,296,"['thought', 'was', 'well', 'done', 'not', 'as', 'much', 'mystery', 'impact', 'grief', 'somewhat', 'fragile', 'psyche', 'main', 'actress', 'Shirley', 'Henderson', 'really', 'unraveling', 'emotional', 'state', 'really', 'loved', 'vicar', 'Shireen', 'Shah', 'as', 'well', 'scenes', 'two']",Frozen

She has a way of making you feel her pain and you just want to reach out to her, try to help her.  It doesn't matter what the budget is when you have such fine acting from the entire cast.  It's not your average whodoneit but worth a watch.",4,Shirley Henderson is wonderful,1365984000,"04 15, 2013",2013,317,"['Shirley', 'Henderson', 'wonderful', 'actress', 'enjoy', 'work', 'great', 'deal', 'way', 'making', 'feel', 'pain', 'just', 'want', 'reach', 'out', 'try', 'help', ""n't"", 'matter', 'what', 'budget', 'when', 'have', 'such', 'fine', 'acting', 'entire', 'cast', 'not', 'average', 'whodoneit', 'watch']",Frozen

If you watch this movie then you need to pay attention to what certain characters say in the beginning and what they say in the end. Piece it all together and viola! you find out what happened to Annie. in the end I was shocked and satisfied with a good movie.,4,Pay Attention to the small details..and major ones,1264204800,"01 23, 2010",2010,339,"['great', 'story', 'feels', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'answers', 'do', 'watch', 'movie', 'then', 'need', 'pay', 'attention', 'what', 'certain', 'characters', 'say', 'beginning', 'what', 'say', 'end', 'Piece', 'together', 'viola', 'find', 'out', 'what', 'happened', 'Annie', 'end', 'was', 'shocked', 'satisfied', 'good', 'movie']",Frozen
1226013,A13UAIE3K517CQ,B001P80ZIS,sft,"[25, 27]","Shirley Henderson has cornered the market when it comes to playing the emotionally fragile waif and here she uses her talent to good effect in a small film that punches well above its weight. Frozen is wistful, dreamlike, and solidly unpretentious. Kathy's obsessive search for her missing sister Annie becomes increasingly elegiac as she discovers that Annie disappeared in the `dead ground' between two surveillance cameras. This blind spot becomes a portal into another place, where she glimpses her sister. There are no flashy special effects here, just grey urban landscapes and melancholic shots of the mudflats of Morecombe Bay. In fact describing his movie does little to do it justice as its simple style belies its enigmatic charm. If you have to have car chases and shoot-outs in order to enjoy a movie Frozen is not for you, but if you appreciate a thoughtful study of pain and loss you should enjoy this film.",4,"Fish, lies, and videotape",1252627200,"09 11, 2009",2009,922,"['Shirley', 'Henderson', 'cornered', 'market', 'when', 'playing', 'emotionally', 'fragile', 'waif', 'here', 'talent', 'good', 'effect', 'small', 'film', 'well', 'weight', 'Frozen', 'wistful', 'dreamlike', 'solidly', 'unpretentious', 'Kathy', 'obsessive', 'search', 'missing', 'sister', 'Annie', 'increasingly', 'elegiac', 'Annie', 'disappeared', 'dead', 'ground', 'two', 'surveillance', 'cameras', 'blind', 'spot', 'portal', 'place', 'where', 'sister', 'are', 'flashy', 'special', 'effects', 'here', 'just', 'grey', 'urban', 'landscapes', 'melancholic', 'shots', 'mudflats', 'Morecombe', 'Bay', 'fact', 'describing', 'movie', 'little', 'do', 'justice', 'simple', 'style', 'enigmatic', 'charm', 'have', 'have', 'car', 'chases', 'shoot-outs', 'order', 'enjoy', 'movie', 'Frozen', 'not', 'appreciate', 'thoughtful', 'study', 'pain', 'loss', 'should', 'enjoy', 'film']",Frozen
