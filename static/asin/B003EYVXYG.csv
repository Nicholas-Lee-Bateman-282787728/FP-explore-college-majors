I disliked actors, even the ''kid'' that could easily get the gun from the hands of the national guardsman. They all act so macho, so brave, so careless and goofy, none of them seemed to be afraid. None of them seemed to care much if there was a zombie behind. They all seemed to be very fine among the living dead. Everyone could easily place headshots and it was all like:''Here is the zombie, okay let's play with it, have fun and then it's either headshot or flare in the body or you name it''. What do people on an island do with zombies? They are chained and their sole purpose is to live among living like they used when they were alive. The postman zombie, the cooking wife zombie, Romero, that's just not you. What about the guy who bit the fingers off the zombie? Didn't he know he could have swallowed the blood? The fisherman who catches zombie in the water? Lots of zombies that seemed to be everywhere where the soldier swam? I so doubt that if zombies prefer eat living people and their brains, will prefer swimming and eating fish which they of course can't catch. Too many living people get killed by other living people, or kill the close ones. Since the movie actually starts in ''the diary of the dead'', we see familiar faces. The man that was using power to rob people in ''the diary of the dead'' seemed to care less about leaving 1 333 033 $ to himself. Did he have much time to change? Not really. But he became a very different character in this movie. And if that wasn't enough, when the person gets shot and by the script suppose to survive, they seem to move freely as before they got shot. People that get bitten don't scream in pain even if they lose considerable parts of their bodies. And a cranky old man who kills his own daughter to prove something to other survivors. Yes, she was bitten, but he killed her much much later for nothing. She was although about to say something and since she died on half the sentence, I don't know what it was. Visual effects are okay. Nothing too special, in fact sometimes it seemed like a downgrade. Romero's previous works seemed much better. And I don't mean only the script.",2,Weak attempt to make money?,1325030400,"12 28, 2011",2011,2241,"['movie', 'not', 'scary', 'horrifying', 'even', 'exciting', 'however', 'much', 'more', 'comedy', 'disliked', 'actors', 'even', 'kid', 'could', 'easily', 'get', 'gun', 'hands', 'national', 'guardsman', 'act', 'so', 'macho', 'so', 'brave', 'so', 'careless', 'goofy', 'none', 'seemed', 'be', 'afraid', 'None', 'seemed', 'care', 'much', 'was', 'zombie', 'seemed', 'be', 'very', 'fine', 'living', 'dead', 'Everyone', 'could', 'easily', 'place', 'headshots', 'was', 'zombie', 'okay', 'let', 'play', 'have', 'fun', 'then', 'headshot', 'flare', 'body', 'name', 'What', 'do', 'people', 'island', 'do', 'zombies', 'are', 'chained', 'sole', 'purpose', 'live', 'living', 'used', 'when', 'were', 'alive', 'postman', 'zombie', 'cooking', 'wife', 'zombie', 'Romero', 'just', 'not', 'What', 'guy', 'who', 'fingers', 'zombie', 'Did', ""n't"", 'know', 'could', 'have', 'swallowed', 'blood', 'fisherman', 'who', 'zombie', 'water', 'Lots', 'zombies', 'seemed', 'be', 'everywhere', 'where', 'soldier', 'swam', 'so', 'doubt', 'zombies', 'prefer', 'eat', 'living', 'people', 'brains', 'will', 'prefer', 'swimming', 'eating', 'fish', 'course', 'ca', ""n't"", 'catch', 'Too', 'many', 'living', 'people', 'get', 'killed', 'other', 'living', 'people', 'kill', 'close', 'ones', 'movie', 'actually', 'diary', 'dead', 'see', 'familiar', 'man', 'was', 'using', 'power', 'rob', 'people', 'diary', 'dead', 'seemed', 'care', 'less', 'leaving', '1', '333', '033', 'have', 'much', 'time', 'change', 'Not', 'really', 'became', 'very', 'different', 'character', 'movie', 'was', ""n't"", 'enough', 'when', 'person', 'shot', 'script', 'suppose', 'survive', 'seem', 'move', 'freely', 'got', 'shot', 'People', 'get', 'bitten', 'do', ""n't"", 'scream', 'pain', 'even', 'lose', 'considerable', 'parts', 'bodies', 'cranky', 'old', 'man', 'who', 'own', 'daughter', 'prove', 'something', 'other', 'survivors', 'Yes', 'was', 'bitten', 'killed', 'much', 'much', 'later', 'nothing', 'was', 'say', 'something', 'died', 'sentence', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'what', 'was', 'Visual', 'effects', 'are', 'okay', 'Nothing', 'too', 'special', 'fact', 'sometimes', 'seemed', 'downgrade', 'Romero', 'previous', 'works', 'seemed', 'much', 'better', 'do', ""n't"", 'mean', 'only', 'script']",N/A

1342369,A3JXPMX8E59PL1,B003EYVXYG,Adam B. Krenn,"[55, 72]","The shotgun blast of reviews for this film are baffling to me. But then again, it is important to remember that Diary of the Dead was initially trashed, Land of the Dead was moderately reviewed at best and Day of the Dead was initially hated (and is now considered a fan favorite).With that said, here is my take on it, for what it is worth...This movie does differ in tone than many of Romero's other films. Certainly not as heavy or serious as Diary of the Dead intended to be or Land of the Dead mostly was. When a National Guard Soldier blows the head off of a zombie (in, albeit, a pretty cheesy CGI effect) in the first few moments of the film, my brain did not go into ""This movie sucks"" mode as so many others seemed to. My brain went into, ""Ah! Just like Dawn of the Dead! This movie is a romp!"" Like most competent Directors (and I consider Romero VERY competent as a film director, not to mention Indie film hero), Romero shows us what HE wants us to see and he always has a reason for doing it. That head-blowing-off scene was there for a reason. Several people, I feel, just didn't understand the reason.I personally feel, many fans of any artist (regardless of medium) begin to form a very rigid idea of what that artist's work is, especially when they come to most of that artist's work after it had been completed (or are young fans as I was). And when said artist creates something new, sometimes fans struggle with the interpretation.What is unique about this film despite its lighter overall tone(and I feel most critiques missed) is that here we have multi-layered social commentary with a subtle complexity not normally seen even in most Romero movies. The initial question: Should we keep our loved-ones ""alive"" as-it-were as zombies, hoping for a cure? Eventually devolves into the nature of humanity and its ability to hold grudges far past rationality, common-sense and sanity. Even one of the last lines in the film and the decisions Sarge makes defy reason but are sadly believable from the frame-work of the human mind. The social commentary Romero is known for is here and more complex than ever!The more I think and reflect on this film the more I realize this is one of Romero's very best in what he has to say about humanity and it is VERY relevant to the times. This film, despite its lighter tone, is a tragedy of the human spirit. It is full of potentially good people making bad decisions, even in the final frames, albeit in a fun and entertaining way. Much like our modern world, in that as we are faced with serious issues and many more serious ones on the horizon, we choose look away, not taking it as seriously as we should and continue to make the wrong choices because we are too rooted in our past. So are the characters in this film.One final note: If you are a Romero fan, to heck with bad reviews!!! At the very least you owe Romero one viewing of this film, love it or not. This artist created an entire sub-genre of horror and he continues to make films outside of the Hollywood system! This fact alone should guarantee a fan's price of admission. Okay, I'm getting off the soap-box.I enjoyed this film and when I purchase the Blu-Ray I will continue to enjoy this film. I am grateful Romero is still making movies (especially the zombie ones although I am a huge fan of Bruiser as well) and I hope Romero continues to make more.",5,Survival of Romero...,1275350400,"06 1, 2010",2010,3379,"['shotgun', 'blast', 'reviews', 'film', 'are', 'baffling', 'then', 'again', 'important', 'remember', 'Diary', 'Dead', 'was', 'initially', 'trashed', 'Land', 'Dead', 'was', 'moderately', 'reviewed', 'best', 'Day', 'Dead', 'was', 'initially', 'hated', 'now', 'considered', 'fan', 'favorite', '.With', 'said', 'here', 'take', 'what', 'worth', 'movie', 'differ', 'tone', 'many', 'Romero', 'other', 'films', 'Certainly', 'not', 'heavy', 'serious', 'Diary', 'Dead', 'intended', 'be', 'Land', 'Dead', 'mostly', 'was', 'When', 'National', 'Guard', 'Soldier', 'head', 'zombie', 'albeit', 'pretty', 'cheesy', 'CGI', 'effect', 'first', 'few', 'moments', 'film', 'brain', 'did', 'not', 'go', 'movie', 'mode', 'so', 'many', 'others', 'seemed', 'My', 'brain', 'went', 'Ah', 'Just', 'Dawn', 'Dead', 'movie', 'romp', 'most', 'competent', 'Directors', 'consider', 'Romero', 'VERY', 'competent', 'film', 'director', 'not', 'mention', 'Indie', 'film', 'hero', 'Romero', 'what', 'HE', 'see', 'always', 'reason', 'doing', 'head-blowing-off', 'scene', 'was', 'there', 'reason', 'Several', 'people', 'feel', 'just', 'did', ""n't"", 'understand', 'reason.I', 'personally', 'feel', 'many', 'fans', 'artist', 'regardless', 'medium', 'begin', 'form', 'very', 'rigid', 'idea', 'what', 'artist', 'work', 'especially', 'when', 'come', 'most', 'artist', 'work', 'had', 'been', 'completed', 'are', 'young', 'fans', 'was', 'when', 'said', 'artist', 'creates', 'something', 'new', 'sometimes', 'fans', 'struggle', 'interpretation.What', 'unique', 'film', 'lighter', 'overall', 'tone', 'feel', 'most', 'critiques', 'missed', 'here', 'have', 'multi-layered', 'social', 'commentary', 'subtle', 'complexity', 'not', 'normally', 'seen', 'even', 'most', 'Romero', 'movies', 'initial', 'question', 'Should', 'keep', 'loved-ones', 'alive', 'as-it-were', 'zombies', 'hoping', 'cure', 'Eventually', 'nature', 'humanity', 'ability', 'hold', 'grudges', 'far', 'past', 'rationality', 'common-sense', 'sanity', 'Even', 'one', 'last', 'lines', 'film', 'decisions', 'Sarge', 'defy', 'reason', 'are', 'sadly', 'believable', 'frame-work', 'human', 'mind', 'social', 'commentary', 'Romero', 'known', 'here', 'more', 'complex', 'ever', 'more', 'think', 'reflect', 'film', 'more', 'realize', 'one', 'Romero', 'very', 'best', 'what', 'say', 'humanity', 'VERY', 'relevant', 'times', 'film', 'lighter', 'tone', 'tragedy', 'human', 'spirit', 'full', 'potentially', 'good', 'people', 'making', 'bad', 'decisions', 'even', 'final', 'frames', 'albeit', 'fun', 'entertaining', 'way', 'Much', 'modern', 'world', 'are', 'faced', 'serious', 'issues', 'many', 'more', 'serious', 'ones', 'horizon', 'choose', 'look', 'away', 'not', 'taking', 'as', 'seriously', 'should', 'continue', 'make', 'wrong', 'choices', 'are', 'too', 'rooted', 'past', 'are', 'characters', 'film.One', 'final', 'note', 'are', 'Romero', 'fan', 'heck', 'bad', 'reviews', 'very', 'least', 'owe', 'Romero', 'one', 'viewing', 'film', 'love', 'not', 'artist', 'created', 'entire', 'sub-genre', 'horror', 'make', 'films', 'Hollywood', 'system', 'fact', 'alone', 'should', 'guarantee', 'fan', 'price', 'admission', 'Okay', ""'m"", 'getting', 'off', 'soap-box.I', 'enjoyed', 'film', 'when', 'purchase', 'Blu-Ray', 'will', 'continue', 'enjoy', 'film', 'am', 'grateful', 'Romero', 'still', 'making', 'movies', 'especially', 'zombie', 'ones', 'am', 'huge', 'fan', 'Bruiser', 'well', 'hope', 'Romero', 'make', 'more']",N/A
1342370,AZSN1TO0JI87B,B003EYVXYG,A. Estes,"[2, 6]","Since the resurgence of the zombie genre with films like ""Shaun of the Dead,"" ""28 Days Later"" and Zack Snyder's remake of ""Dawn of the Dead,"" George A. Romero -- undisputed Grandfather of the zombie genre -- has come out of the woodwork once every few years to try and either capitalize on or define the current undead movement. In spite of his best intentions, however, he has failed where he has succeeded oh so many times before. First, with ""Land of the Dead,"" which in spite of being a surprisingly strong return to form, turned out to be a commercial dud, leading into the low-budget reboot of sorts with ""Diary of the Dead,"" a ""The Blair Witch Project"" spin on the material that only served to smudge Romero's legacy rather than breathe new life into it. This of course serves as the lead-in to his equally underwhelming new opus, ""Survival of the Dead.""Like ""Diary of the Dead,"" ""Survival"" was born of a potentially great idea. Continuing where we left off in the previous film, the undead are slowly taking over the globe. On a remote island off the coast of Delaware, two families are finding ways to cope in spite of their bitter rivalry. One aims to vanquish any and all zombie inhabitants, while the other strives to domesticate and educate them. Naturally, this leads to heavy gun-play and lots (and I mean lots) of badly rendered CGI gore. While this concept is certainly a breath of fresh air, it is hampered by poor execution. Obviously limited by its budget, the film can't help but look and feel cheap. What really brings it down, though, isn't the bad cinematography nor the bad blood (ahem), but rather, the dull script that lacks focus and a clear vision. Whether Romero takes his material seriously or not is never made clear, and in the end, you'll find yourself chuckling at the ridiculous nature of it all instead of chilled to the bone by its characters and their actions. The actors are so wooden and the characters so clich&eacute;d and silly that they make their supporting undead stars seem more realistic and interesting by comparison. Is that the fisherman from ""The Simpsons"" leading one of the clans? It might as well be.While Romero can never be accused of making the same film twice, it must be noted that his best days are obviously behind him. While no one can expect him to deliver another ""Dawn of the Dead,"" I think it's safe to say that no one could have expected him to fall so far from grace. The man deserves respect and his legacy as the king of the zombie film is still intact, although currently crumbling. Hopefully this downward spiral is corrected or else it's best that George leaves his own franchise for dead.",2,Soap Opera of the Dead,1283817600,"09 7, 2010",2010,2664,"['resurgence', 'zombie', 'genre', 'films', 'Shaun', 'Dead', '28', 'Days', 'Later', 'Zack', 'Snyder', 'remake', 'Dawn', 'Dead', 'George', 'A.', 'Romero', 'undisputed', 'Grandfather', 'zombie', 'genre', 'come', 'woodwork', 'once', 'few', 'years', 'try', 'capitalize', 'define', 'current', 'undead', 'movement', 'spite', 'best', 'intentions', 'however', 'failed', 'where', 'succeeded', 'oh', 'so', 'many', 'times', 'First', 'Land', 'Dead', 'spite', 'being', 'surprisingly', 'strong', 'return', 'form', 'turned', 'out', 'be', 'commercial', 'dud', 'leading', 'low-budget', 'reboot', 'sorts', 'Diary', 'Dead', 'Blair', 'Witch', 'Project', 'spin', 'material', 'only', 'served', 'smudge', 'Romero', 'legacy', 'rather', 'breathe', 'new', 'life', 'course', 'serves', 'lead-in', 'equally', 'underwhelming', 'new', 'opus', 'Survival', 'Dead', 'Diary', 'Dead', 'Survival', 'was', 'born', 'potentially', 'great', 'idea', 'Continuing', 'where', 'left', 'off', 'previous', 'film', 'undead', 'are', 'slowly', 'taking', 'over', 'globe', 'remote', 'island', 'coast', 'Delaware', 'two', 'families', 'are', 'finding', 'ways', 'cope', 'spite', 'bitter', 'rivalry', 'One', 'vanquish', 'zombie', 'inhabitants', 'other', 'strives', 'domesticate', 'educate', 'Naturally', 'heavy', 'gun-play', 'lots', 'mean', 'lots', 'badly', 'rendered', 'CGI', 'gore', 'concept', 'certainly', 'breath', 'fresh', 'air', 'hampered', 'poor', 'execution', 'Obviously', 'limited', 'budget', 'film', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'look', 'feel', 'cheap', 'What', 'really', 'down', 'though', ""n't"", 'bad', 'cinematography', 'bad', 'blood', 'ahem', 'rather', 'dull', 'script', 'focus', 'clear', 'vision', 'Romero', 'material', 'seriously', 'not', 'never', 'made', 'clear', 'end', ""'ll"", 'find', 'chuckling', 'ridiculous', 'nature', 'instead', 'chilled', 'bone', 'characters', 'actions', 'actors', 'are', 'so', 'wooden', 'characters', 'so', 'clich', 'eacute', 'silly', 'make', 'supporting', 'undead', 'stars', 'seem', 'more', 'realistic', 'interesting', 'comparison', 'fisherman', 'Simpsons', 'leading', 'one', 'clans', 'might', 'as', 'well', 'Romero', 'can', 'never', 'be', 'accused', 'making', 'same', 'film', 'twice', 'must', 'be', 'noted', 'best', 'days', 'are', 'obviously', 'one', 'can', 'expect', 'deliver', 'Dawn', 'Dead', 'think', 'safe', 'say', 'one', 'could', 'have', 'expected', 'fall', 'so', 'far', 'grace', 'man', 'respect', 'legacy', 'king', 'zombie', 'film', 'still', 'intact', 'currently', 'crumbling', 'Hopefully', 'downward', 'spiral', 'corrected', 'else', 'best', 'George', 'own', 'franchise', 'dead']",N/A

The whole premise about a family feud on an island off Delaware (where everyone has Irish accents that apparently have never faded an iota in the doubtless hundreds of years they've been in America) is small-minded and dull.

Jake Kincaid, Jack of...","[4, 5]","I notice in quite a few of these reviews that folks are a little disappointed in this entry by Zombie-Master George Romero.While I admit it's not MY favorite of his either (although I DID enjoy the film), I temper that with what I hope is an accurate understanding of something I picked up watching the special features.In an interview contained on this disc, Romero mentions that he would like to create a ""mythos"" (using ""The Lord of the Rings"" as an example to illustrate what he means) of his ""Zombiverse"" (MY term, not his...yeah, I know it sucks).  Some may argue he HAS, in many respects, with his original trilogy, but HE seemed to think he wanted something more cohesive, more epic in scale...If this is really what is in the maestro's mind, perhaps this entry into the series is laying groundwork for future releases, much as George LUCAS had to do with the first of the ""Star Wars"" prequels...a lot of people didn't like it, either (I did), but I wonder if they really thought about just how much backstory he had to lay down in just one chapter.Indeed, perhaps Romero had this in mind all along when he re-booted his franchise (aren't you glad I didn't say ""Zombiverse"" again?) with ""Diary of the Dead""...maybe we fans are going to be in flesh-munching heaven over the next few years as George serves us up an interlocked series of movies that form a fabric unlike any done before in the genre of fear.Anyway, grandiose postulation aside, I wanted to give any of you interested MY take on ""Survival of the Dead"", so here goes:Fans of Romero get what they expect:  The zombies are not the real threat, PEOPLE are.  The shambling undead are there as a catalyst for what transpires between the breathing characters in the flick, in this case a ""Hatfield and McCoy"" family feud scenario, taking place on a small island (with the added bonus of the rogue National Guardsman from ""Diary"" caught up in the game).  The main conflict raises the question of are the undead STILL who they were; can they be cured?  Or are they just soulless shells now, better to put the body down and celebrate the memory of who they WERE?Heady stuff, on the one hand, but for Romero...well, I'm surprised it took him six films to get to it.I was honestly impressed with the acting...the characters were believable, although some of the situations stretched my suspension of disbelief considerably...moreso than the obvious, of course.  All of the principal cast were well-played, each offering something different to the overall flow of the story, as we the viewer make up our own minds, along with the Guardsmen, just whose side we will take.  Most impressive to me (and this is owed to both the writing AND the acting) is you see characters strugging with themselves; a basically good, compassionate man struggles to convince himself he's emotionless and selfish; two men of questionable moral fiber fight to convince themselves of their perspective ""rightness"", even playing up ""God's will""...a hefty emotional sum, not absent from Romero's previous films, but showcased in a still subdued but more  obvious manner.Now lest I get you all thinking this is ""The Notebook"" with zombies, rest assured, there's plenty o' gut-munchin' and torso tearing to be had here...some of it viscerally excellent, but some...well, that brings me to why it only gets a three-and-a-half-star rating from me......my primary issue was the preponderance of digital effects.  I realize that CGI is more economical, both monetarily and in terms of time, and in an independent film such as this will typically be the prime focus, but being a fan of what has gone before it just seems ludicrous in a Romero flick, at least in several scenes.  Maybe I'm being picky, but after Savini's work in ""Dawn"" and ""Day"", the digitized blood and gore in certain scenes just looks gaudy and amateurish.A final note:  there is one interesting departure from the ""accepted"" rules of zombies in this film (although not really from Romero's work) that those of you that watch this will see in the latter half of the film, and I'm interested as to whether or not that will play a part (and what part that may BE) in future films (hoping ferverently, of course, that there will BE more).All in all, for Romero fans, it's a definite purchase; you get all that you know and love from George.  For those that are more current in their zombie affections, you should at least give it a rent...it's not a bad film at all, but it may fall a little flat on those that are looking for ""the next big zombie film"" from this one...but I DO believe that if you love the genre, you'll find something here you enjoy....and George, should you happen to read this...we fans are waiting, at least SOMEwhat patiently:)",4,"Romero's ""Phantom Menace""...??",1286755200,"10 11, 2010",2010,4744,"['notice', 'quite', 'few', 'reviews', 'folks', 'are', 'little', 'disappointed', 'entry', 'Zombie-Master',

1342376,A2D7B5I7ZQ51XL,B003EYVXYG,Anthony Pittore,"[3, 7]","Fresh off a fifty-mile drive from the closest theatre playing horror legend George A. Romero's new zombie flick 'Survival of the Dead,' I am more than pleased to say the time & oh-so-expensive gas was worth it. Though Lord Romero has received more than his fair share of negative feedback for his last few films ('Bruiser,' 'Land of the Dead,' and 'Diary of the Dead), I have yet to see a single film of his that I would call less than good. And, my friends, the streak continues with 'Survival of the Dead.' Sure, I may not be the most unbiased of critics on the matter, but we're all hooked to something.'Survival of the Dead' focuses on two sets of very different characters. The first we're introduced to is led by 'Nicotine' Crocket (Alan Van Sprang), the jerk ""guardsmen"" that first appeared in 'Diary of the Dead.' He wasn't a central figure in the previous film, but just one of the many dangerous obstacles the main characters from 'Diary' stumbled across during their journey. Crocket leads a group of other guardsmen around the country looking for, well, anything they can find. After hooking up with a crackshot kid and an armoured car full of cash, the guard unit heads up north after their discovery of Patrick O'Flynn (Kenneth Welsh), an old Irish fella on the internet advertising a safe haven. O'Flynn, the leader of his own group, is a now-banished former resident of Plum Island, a small isle in the Atlantic. Intent on seeking vengeance against the other zombie-saving Irish clansman from the island, O'Flynn convinces Crocket's gang to head to Plum Island with him.The first thing that many Romero fans will notice is something that had been missing in the 'Dead' series before this film: a recurring character. Crocket, the antihero and occasional narrator of the new film, wasn't the worst choice Romero could make for a recurring character in 'Survival of the Dead.' Alongside Crocket, there is a varied mix of supporting characters from the horny lesbian Tomboy (Athena Karkanis) to the equally horny token minority Francisco (Stefano DiMatteo). One of the major problems most people (including myself) had with Romero's last film was the acting. In this film, the acting was pretty much satisfactory, with only couple issues (DiMatteo being a major issue in himself). Among the other technical aspects, the Romero-controlled factors of the film were, as expected, damn good. The direction and writing were much better than that of 'Diary,' and the beauty of the Ontario-filmed landscapes were wonderfully captured.Unfortunately, one visual aspect that was not very good with the film was. . . what else. . . the CGI. I, unlike many horror fans, am not completely against the use of CGI. It has its uses and can actually help a film if used properly. Sure, it's almost always better with real gore effects, but the use of CGI (as Romero himself said) can greatly help a low-budget production. CGI means less time actually on set (which is the most expensive part of the filmmaking process) and it means that Romero can do kills that he had only dreamed of before. Speaking of one very memorable kill from 'Survival,' he said he had been wanting to do it for a long time, but not even the great Tom Savini could pull it off. This means CGI basically allows limitless execution of whatever the director envisions. Sadly, though, the effect is lost much of the time when CGI is used, especially when it's not very well done.Overall, 'Survival of the Dead' is not going to please everyone, quite possibly because people are often too focused on what they think modern cinema should be, and what Romero should be offering. However, the film is a fun zombie-filled ride with a solid story and some memorable gore scenes. It does lack quite a bit in the tension & suspense of the previous films and focuses a bit too much on the comedic side, but it is still a fine addition to the zombie subgenre.Final Verdict: 7.5/10-AP3-",4,A solid addition to the zombie subgenre,1275264000,"05 31, 2010",2010,3942,"['Fresh', 'off', 'fifty-mile', 'drive', 'closest', 'theatre', 'playing', 'horror', 'legend', 'George', 'A.', 'Romero', 'new', 'zombie', 'flick', ""'Survival"", 'Dead', 'am', 'more', 'pleased', 'say', 'time', 'oh-so-expensive', 'gas', 'was', 'worth', 'Lord', 'Romero', 'received', 'more', 'fair', 'share', 'negative', 'feedback', 'last', 'few', 'films', ""'Bruiser"", ""'Land"", 'Dead', ""'Diary"", 'Dead', 'have', 'yet', 'see', 'single', 'film', 'would', 'call', 'less', 'good', 'friends', 'streak', ""'Survival"", 'Dead', 'Sure', 'may', 'not', 'be', 'most', 'unbiased', 'critics', 'matter', ""'re"", 'hooked', 'something', ""'Survival"", 'Dead', 'focuses', 'two', 'sets', 'very', 'different', 'characters', 'first', ""'re"", 'introduced', 'led', ""'Nicotine"", 'Crocket', 'Alan', 'Van', 'Sprang', 'jerk', 'guardsmen', 'first', 'appeared', ""'Diary"", 'Dead', 'was', ""n't"", 'central', 'figure', 'previous', 'film', 'just', 'one', 'many', 'dangerous', 'obstacles', 'main', 'characters', ""'Diary"", 'stumbled', 'journey', 'Crocket', 'group', 'other', 'guardsmen', 'country', 'looking', 'well', 'anything', 'can', 'find', 'hooking', 'up', 'crackshot', 'kid', 'armoured', 'car', 'full', 'cash', 'guard', 'unit', 'up', 'north', 'discovery', 'Patrick', ""O'Flynn"", 'Kenneth', 'Welsh', 'old', 'Irish', 'fella', 'internet', 'advertising', 'safe', 'haven', ""O'Flynn"", 'leader', 'own', 'group', 'now-banished', 'former', 'resident', 'Plum', 'Island', 'small', 'isle', 'Atlantic', 'Intent', 'seeking', 'vengeance', 'other', 'zombie-saving', 'Irish', 'clansman', 'island', ""O'Flynn"", 'Crocket', 'gang', 'head', 'Plum', 'Island', 'him.The', 'first', 'thing', 'many', 'Romero', 'fans', 'will', 'notice', 'something', 'had', 'been', 'missing', ""'Dead"", 'series', 'film', 'recurring', 'character', 'Crocket', 'antihero', 'occasional', 'narrator', 'new', 'film', 'was', ""n't"", 'worst', 'choice', 'Romero', 'could', 'make', 'recurring', 'character', ""'Survival"", 'Dead', 'Alongside', 'Crocket', 'varied', 'mix', 'supporting', 'characters', 'horny', 'lesbian', 'Tomboy', 'Athena', 'Karkanis', 'equally', 'horny', 'token', 'minority', 'Francisco', 'Stefano', 'DiMatteo', 'One', 'major', 'problems', 'most', 'people', 'including', 'had', 'Romero', 'last', 'film', 'was', 'acting', 'film', 'acting', 'was', 'pretty', 'much', 'satisfactory', 'only', 'couple', 'issues', 'DiMatteo', 'being', 'major', 'issue', 'other', 'technical', 'aspects', 'Romero-controlled', 'factors', 'film', 'were', 'expected', 'damn', 'good', 'direction', 'writing', 'were', 'much', 'better', ""'Diary"", 'beauty', 'Ontario-filmed', 'landscapes', 'were', 'wonderfully', 'captured.Unfortunately', 'one', 'visual', 'aspect', 'was', 'not', 'very', 'good', 'film', 'was', 'what', 'else', 'CGI', 'many', 'horror', 'fans', 'am', 'not', 'completely', 'use', 'CGI', 'uses', 'can', 'actually', 'help', 'film', 'used', 'properly', 'Sure', 'almost', 'always', 'better', 'real', 'gore', 'effects', 'use', 'CGI', 'Romero', 'said', 'can', 'greatly', 'help', 'low-budget', 'production', 'CGI', 'less', 'time', 'actually', 'set', 'most', 'expensive', 'part', 'filmmaking', 'process', 'Romero', 'can', 'do', 'kills', 'had', 'only', 'dreamed', 'before', 'Speaking', 'one', 'very', 'memorable', 'kill', ""'Survival"", 'said', 'had', 'been', 'wanting', 'do', 'long', 'time', 'not', 'even', 'great', 'Tom', 'Savini', 'could', 'pull', 'off', 'CGI', 'basically', 'limitless', 'execution', 'director', 'envisions', 'Sadly', 'effect', 'lost', 'much', 'time', 'when', 'CGI', 'used', 'especially', 'when', 'not', 'very', 'well', 'done.Overall', ""'Survival"", 'Dead', 'not', 'going', 'please', 'everyone', 'quite', 'possibly', 'people', 'are', 'often', 'too', 'focused', 'what', 'think', 'modern', 'cinema', 'should', 'be', 'what', 'Romero', 'should', 'be', 'offering', 'However', 'film', 'fun', 'zombie-filled', 'ride', 'solid', 'story', 'memorable', 'gore', 'scenes', 'lack', 'quite', 'bit', 'tension', 'suspense', 'previous', 'films', 'bit', 'too', 'much', 'comedic', 'side', 'still', 'fine', 'addition', 'zombie', 'subgenre.Final', 'Verdict', '7.5/10-AP3-']",N/A

Great themes in the film, perhaps the deepest themes in a Remero zombie movie yet. It's basically about human conflict and how people can not stop fighting eachother no matter how bad things get and how much they need eachoter. The human characters in this film are obviously far worse than the zombies. The themes on religion, family, and solving social ills were also good.On top of that, it was just a lot of fun over all. Hek, even the special effects were good. The CGI looked very realistic, definitely a lot better than Diary of the Dead. The fire extinguisher scene was a bit iffy, but other than that everything looked great imo. I was kinda worried about that after all the groaning due to Romero's interview about the special effects, but I was proven wrong.It also had great oldschool cinematography and I loved the over the top oldschool acting from the heads of the two feuding clans. Also pleased that Romero finally inlcuded a gay character in one of his casts.I definitely think this film will be a success on the home video market, which means we'll be getting a follow up soon. I thought there was something up with the premptive nerd venom spat towards this film before it even came out on DVD, but again they are proven wrong as far as I'm concerned.

The O'Flynns approach the zombie problem with a shoot-to-kill attitude. The Muldoons feel that the zombies should be quarantined, in hopes that a solution will be discovered. Whose side do you think the Guardsmen will choose? That's the plot to this film by George A. Romero.Let me state that I really admire the fact that Romero is trying something new with this movie by making it in the vein of such movies as Zombieland, Shaun of the Dead & Zombie Dearest. Although, personally, I think the movie might have faired better if it were in a more serious tone(like his other movies). Fans are probably going to wonder what possessed Romero to make Survival the way he did(I know I asked that very question). I'm sure he had his reasons.Watching the movie, I realized almost right away that this movie was made on a much lower budget than his past movies. Look at the makeup effects on the zombies, there's hardly any at all. Not only that but the CGI this film has looks amatuerish. Like another reviewer here mentioned: ""Survival comes across like a straight-to-video or made-for-SyFy movie."" That's not what us fans expect from Romero.Out of all Romero's movies, I figure Survival of the Dead will probably be the least liked by all his fans.

Here, Romero quarrels with the idea of whether or not the living dead can be domesticated and eventually cured, or whether they must be eradicated to avoid any future outbreaks. This debate fuels the ongoing struggle between the O'Flynns and the Muldoons, a battle which takes center stage over any of the zombie mayhem in the film. While it cannot be argued that Romero has not attempted any new and interesting ideas in LAND, DIARY, and now SURVIVAL, the execution of each of the films always falls short. The sixth installment never manages to generate any forward momentum, and the social commentary that is worked in to the plot is never fully developed or used to effectively impact the viewer. To put it bluntly, the film is completely uninteresting. There is no one left for the audience to relate to or sympathize with between the thieving soldiers and the two warring families. The man once known for discovering Horror's greatest make-up artist has settled for cheaply-made computerized effects once again, effects which are entirely unconvincing and immediately take the viewer out of the action. Still, what the gore lacks in quality, it makes up for in quantity, with numerous attack sequences filled with head explosions and multiple maulings by the rampaging ghouls.

But still, overall this probably is a slight step back for the zombie master.It does have decent doses of your expected flesh-chomping madness.  I wonder if Romero uses some bad CGI just to illustrate how inferior it is to old school bloody effects with makeup and props.  Still he includes some solid gory moments as well.  One scene that puzzled me was when some hunters beheaded some zombies and but their heads on wooden stakes.  Dead heads on a stick.  These zombies kept moaning despite the fact their brains were removed from the spinal cord.  This scene looked pretty cool, and illustrated the foolishness of the men.  But it seems to contradict the very zombie rules that Romero helped establish.  I was under the impression that headshots or beheadings are supposed to incapacitate the undead, release their souls from their decaying corpses.  Oh well.The most notable point this movie makes is about the violent, idiotic nature of man.  Even in the most desperate, grim situation humanity refuses to unite and work together.  Really, people aren't much smarter than the freakin zombies.I also enjoyed the conflict of disposing of the walking dead.  Killing an infected loved one would be quite a troublesome circumstance.  One man takes it upon himself to rid the world of these soulless creatures.  Another man sees the zombs as merely having a sickness, and possibly curable.  Their obstinate ways proves to be their downfall.  Brilliant message.Overall, SURVIVAL OF THE DEAD is a worthy addition to your zombie collection, or to complete your Romero Dead films.  I was pleased it kept the comedy and romance to a minimum.  Nowhere near Romero's best by any means, but I'll rewatch this again before another viewing of Zombieland.

1342382,A18G7GG53G2X8A,B003EYVXYG,Chris Pandolfi,"[3, 5]","With George A. Romero, it's always about social critique. ""Night of the Living Dead,"" released at the closing of the 1960s, examined the horrors of war - specifically the Cold War and Vietnam - and the harsh reality of racism. ""Dawn of the Dead"" satirized American consumerism. ""Day of the Dead"" suggested that man's greatest enemy isn't a world full of zombies, but his fellow man. ""Land of the Dead"" explored political divisions between classes in a post-apocalyptic community. ""Diary of the Dead,"" structured as a documentary, hinted that the camera can be a weapon just as much as it can be a useful tool. Now we have ""Survival of the Dead,"" a contradiction in terms if ever there was one. What is Romero telling us this time around? The answer, I think, can be found in following quote: ""I like small towns, but small towns give birth to small people.""The small town is Plum Island, located somewhere off the coast of Delaware. The small people of Plum Island are two feuding Irish families, who are divided over the treatment of zombies; the O'Flynns believe that they should be killed (or perhaps it's re-killed) on the spot, whereas the Muldoons believe that they should be kept ""alive"" until a cure can be found. Until then, maybe they can be trained to crave meat other than human. Perhaps I'm flawed in that I have trouble believing such an isolated community could exist, especially one that just happens to populated entirely by the Irish. Regardless, the respective elders of each family, Patrick O'Flynn (Kenneth Walsh) and Seamus Muldoon (Richard Fitzpatrick), are annoyingly stubborn men who go at it like gunslingers that salivate at the word ""draw.""Because of his beliefs, Patrick is cast off to the mainland. Flash forward three weeks; we meet four AWOL National Guard soldiers, led by Sergeant ""Nicotine"" Crockett (Alan van Sprung) and a crafty teenager, who learn of Plum Island through an internet video - filmed by Patrick - and decide to go there. This raises serious logistical questions, since, within the context of a zombie apocalypse, it's reasonable to assume that there would no longer be people around to keep internet service up and running. Or electricity, for that matter. And yet we see a video playing on a properly working iPhone, which is somehow being charged. We also see brief clips of a late-night talk show, where the host cracks a number of dirty zombie jokes. Ah, so we no longer have functional communities, but we still have comedians working in fully operational television studios. This itself begs the question of who amongst the living still has a sense of humor, what with the zombies eating people up and all.Apparently, the only one with a sense of humor is Romero, who for ""Survival of the Dead"" finds all sorts of amusing ways for the characters to kill off zombies. As long as I live, I don't think I will ever forget the image of Crockett lighting his cigarette from the flaming head of a zombie he shot with a flare gun. Nor will I soon forget the moment a zombie gets a head full of fire extinguisher foam, causing its eyes to pop right out of the sockets. Too bad Romero didn't make this movie in 3-D - he missed out on the opportunity to have eyeballs fly directly at the audience. Too gimmicky? So is killing a zombie with foam from a fire extinguisher. Watching moments like this, one idly wonders why some zombies are mindless eating machines while others seem capable of more complex activities, such as sitting behind the wheel and hitting the gas pedal or endlessly riding a horse.Most of the zombies are merely shot in the head, which I guess is only fitting since guns play a major role in the plot. I can't think of a single character who doesn't hold a gun, point a gun, or shoot a gun at some point, if not because of the zombies, then because of the other living people, since apparently no one can be trusted in this alternate universe. Honestly, this movie would be the perfect endorsement for the NRA.The more I think about ""Survival of the Dead,"" the more I realize that Romero's sermonizing had absolutely no affect on me. All I really got out of it was the hilarity of watching zombies die silly deaths, which is problematic since the basic plot is one of gloomy sincerity. Furthermore, there isn't a single likeable character to be found; this goes double for Patrick and Seamus, which is bad because the tension between them is drastically reduced, pretty much to the point where we no longer care who we think is right and who we think is wrong. Romero has limitless options when it comes to zombie parables, but I'm starting to wonder if they will continue to have the same power they once had. Let's face it - the genre is tired and unoriginal. He should consider other ideas, at least for the time being.",3,Who Are the Living to Tell the Dead They Shouldn't Survive?,1277856000,"06 30, 2010",2010,4792,"['George', 'A.', 'Romero', 'always',

1342389,A3IIBE4D1VECWC,B003EYVXYG,D. Allen,"[2, 4]","I had this pre-ordered on Amazon, but was thinking I should cancel due to all the negative reviews. I'm glad I didn't listen to the reviews. :)The movie Survival of the Dead marks the first for a lot of things for Romero.First is that it's the first time there is a direct sequel. The original trilogy and the two previous films were all related, but unrelated in term of the character connections minus a few references here and there in the films. In this version, Romero use the troops from his previous movie Diary of the Dead, who if I remember correctly, entered the main character's camper half way in the movie. It was an insignificant part of the movie Diary, but it was used as the foundation of characters in Survival.The second thing is that this is the first time where Romero intentionally used comedy in his film. I'd say the originals had very few ""outright"" comical parts, but in the introduction before Survival, Romero comes on screen and explains that there are comedy in the film.Overall I think the movie was great. The story of Survival is similar to the story of Day. There is an island with two leaders, one of which believe that all the walking dead should be put to the ground. The other believes that the dead should be kept, should be rehabilitated.Overall the movie gets slightly ridiculous by the end. There is a part where they were using this ""smart"" zombie who rode a horse, and they believe that by eating another food source, it would prove that they can be trained to eat something besides human. I think Romero forgot that in the original Night, there was a zombie who ate bugs, so it's a bit of a delusion on the part of the survivors to think they can be trained to want something else. So I'm unsure exactly why Romero decided to go this approach, but my assumption is that he wanted to show that the characters in the movie just weren't thinking rationally and that since there is a on-going feud, the two sides are just taking the opposite approach just to disagree with one another.As a fan of Romero's film, looking at his latest creation, apart from the original trilogy, I think Romero ""missed"" something here. Perhaps it's the comedy tone or whatever, but just something doesn't hit it right with the original. Perhaps it's a bit of nostalgia of the originals, or perhaps Romero lost touch with something, I just don't seem to think of Survival as anything that can compete with his original trilogy. I think he done the ""smart"" zombie idea a bit too much. As Captain Rhodes would have said, ""They're DEAD!"" I mean I think it's an interesting concept to think that maybe they're us inside that rotting exterior, but overall we just can't see them as that since they clearly want to eat anything living. Realistically, I guess one would look at it on a viral level, rather than a psychological level which seems to be the main theme in the current version of the film (understanding what they are, and trying to change their drive is a bit sort of like psychology, or maybe behavioral therapy for the dead).Personally as a fan, I understand Romero's approach to trying to change the behavior and drive of the zombies, but Day of the Dead already proven that even going with the cognitive behavioral therapy approach, human nature is just too evil and greedy to do it properly. We get all that. Now it's time to move onto another theme besides behavioral or even the concept of a ""smart"" zombie. What we need is another theme that fans can go off one. We should go with the viral approach. Personally I think it would have been just awesome if Survival was about an island of researchers trying to work out a cure like in Day, but end up backfiring. That would have been great and no longer trying to make the audience buy into the whole ""Let's train them, but let's show them that they can't be trained."" I recall Romero said anyone who died, and did not die of a brain injury, would rise back up. So with that in mind, it could present an interesting research potential for a movie.Overall good movie, but hopefully next film Romero will try to do something drastically and not try to write the same exact story but differently.

1342390,A3A48KP40IXF2R,B003EYVXYG,Darthcasey,"[2, 3]","The bad reviews given unfairly to this film are a result of impossibly high expectations. As this is a ""sequel"" to the living dead series, fans are quick to compare it to the predecessors.  In doing so, of course you'll be upset. Romero will never top ""Night of the Living Dead"" or ""Dawn of the Dead"". Don't expect him to. As a veteran Romero fan, I cringe at the reviews for this decade's living dead films. I read a review somewhere that claimed something like: Diary of the Dead sucked but at least it was better than Land of the Dead. What? ""Land"" was frightening, full of action, mild humor, complete with the expected social message, and well-crafted characters--just like ""Dawn of the Dead."" Yet people bash it. ""Romero's using CGI now.  Wah!"" A city fortified years after the zombie holocaust? But don't use CGI, Romero; make films like you're still in the seventies. Sure. ""Diary of the Dead"" is another victim of poor reviews. Because of the use of subjective camera like in ""The Blair Witch Project""? Big deal. Pay attention to the good horror scenes: the opening news footage, the zombie dragging his IV drip as he attacks, the lead actress's return home to find her family undead, Romero's own homage to the ""Dawn"" tenement scene, and the man drying his hair tackled into the bathtub by a zombie. To prove I'm not sold on a film simply because Romero directed it(""Season of the Witch"" and ""There's Always Vanilla"" belong in the toilet), I'll admit that I wasn't keen on ""Survival"" at first. Too much comedy-often borderline silliness-and ridiculous Irish accents(a descendent of Irishmen born in America will not have an Irish accent). Even after my third viewing, these cons remain. But I realized my error: This is a good film. If you do compare ""Survival"" to predecessors, how do you not find good in this one? The scene with the zombie children is amazing; it could've been in ""Dawn"". As could the zombie driving the car. The zombies in the bay reflected ""Land"". Romero returned to overt gore that ""Diary"" lacked (and not all CGI-though I do miss Tom Savini). One minor complaint is on commentary: One producer said that Romero brought up new themes such as how loved ones deal with family member zombies and the debate with whether or not they should be kept 'alive'.  Hello, did he not see ""Dawn""? A few minutes into ""Dawn"" the anchorman and the doctor argued about handling the pandemic ""without emotion."" Not long after that SWAT and Guardsmen raided an apartment where families refused to kill dead relatives(the cellar scene, oh yeah); Peter awaited Roger's resurrection in a terrifying, dramatic scene; and in a devastating scene Peter awaits Flyboy's return, post-mortem, so he can kill him, relieve his good friend of a 'life' as the walking dead. New theme, producer? Not at all. This allusion to ""Dawn"" should be enough to entice Romero fans to ""Survival"". Overall, this is the worst of the living dead series, but for me that's like saying the worst ice cream.

1342391,A1N1H9FB2LKVI3,B003EYVXYG,DarthJustice,"[0, 1]","So, after two years, I finally saw Survival of the Dead for the first time.Survival features a second occurrence in the Dead universe--the return of a character seen in a previous movie. This time around it's Sgt. Crockett, the leader of the ""highwaymen"" in Diary who rob the main characters. This time around, he and the other deserters, along with a character called ""Boy"", find themselves on an island whose occupants belong to one of two main families, the O'Flynns and Muldoons.One family wants to exterminate the zombies and the other, to corral them until a cure is found (though one must wonder what they would do about gaping wounds, but this is a point not addressed). It just so happens the head of each family have been bitter enemies since childhood and O'Flynn wants revenge for  being kicked off the island.On it's own, it's an okay zombie movie. As part of Romero's ""Dead"" franchise, it stacks up somewhat poorly to the original three but is not much worse than Diary or Land (though I enjoyed Diary more and I'm still deciding on this vs Land). Here we get more CGI effects that in one case was pretty poorly done. Watch the fire zombie shot with a flare gun as its head lights up on fire. I thought it almost approached ""webcam"" affect.All in all, it's not really a bad movie.

There's a fella on here that actually accused Romero of not being a good filmmaker because he thought this film,um, 'sucked, and Diary was mediocre. So, you don't like his last two films, so that means he's a bad filmmaker? Taking into consideration all the other films he's made that you liked? Uh-huh. Sure. Why not?Anyway, enough anti-fanboy rants. On to the actual film, Romero's sixth zombie opus, Survival of the Dead. I actually got a copy from Europe and watched it today after much anticipation. I really loved it. No, it's not Dawn of the Dead, or Night or even Day or Land, but it's really funny, gross and fast paced. Romero drops any major satire or social satire for an old fashioned Western story of a feuding clan of families and the drifters stuck in the middle. Sound familiar? Well, it might if you're a fan of Westerns or Kirasawa for that matter. I understand that some Romero fans may feel gipped without a satirical jab or social comment coming from a Romero zombie film, but he's made five zombie films with that in them, so go watch them if you miss it. This is Romero taking a break making comic book action yarn that's there to be taken in and not abosrbed.This is the zombie film that most resembles Dawn of the Dead. It's very humorous and action packed. It just doesn't have the satire. Though, Romero does manage to through in some jabs in a voice over at the end of the film as the closing, and funniest, image in the film fades onto screen. Romero is still a master editor and his knack for pacing is more forefront here then ever. The film, minus credits, only runs for an hour and 21 minutes but one never feels short shrifted. Though, I imagine when this thing finally hits the states on disc there might be a director's cut. The acting is all fine and there are some great and funny dialogue exchanges that are vintage Romero cryptic and biting. The female soldier character I feel was fairly weak though. She just didn't seem like she was as committed as the rest of the cast. That would be my only complaint about this fun, no-frills zombie film.Romero, pushing through his70's, is still a filmmaker worth watching. I love that he does things his own way and never compromises these days. I wish more filmmakers would bunk the Hollywood studio system and do it this way. All their films might not be great, but at least they'll be honest and uncomprised by committee micro-management.PS: CGI gore. GET OVER IT! Romero likes to make films out of Hollywood without interferance. He doesn't have a ton of money and time that Hollywood films have, so he uses CGI to speed the process, and honestly, it's not that bad. The fire gag is sketchy, but the visual idea and the joke is so great that I just didn't care. I don't need things spoon fed to me in ultra 'realistic' ways if the ideas are good regardless. That's all.The blu ray may the best package for any Romero zombie epic.  It's about on par with Anchor Bay's recent release of Dawn of the Dead, but without three versions of the same film.  The making of suppliments are done very well and in depth.  Everything's covered from casting, sets, locations, to make up effects.  The only really disappointing thing about the disc is the commentary.  Romero shares it with producers....and they kill it.  I like it when Romero does commentary with people like his wife, or Savini, but these guys all sound like jackals sucking at the teet of the brand name Romero has become.  They're annoying and obviously don't really care about Romero's work or the horror genre.  They're just hitching a ride on coat-tails.  Romero barelys speaks, and doesn't say anything interesting about the project or what is actually on screen.  His shared commentary with his stars of Diary of the Dead was better than this!Finally, I find it funny how many fans turned on Romero(though you know they secretly rushed out and bought a copy of this film anyway).  There was a time right before the Dawn of the Dead remake where Romero struggled to get Land of the Dead(then titled Dead Reckoning) produced.  He hadn't made a film since 1997's Bruiser(worth a look but disappointing.  Very intersting film independently produced by Romero).  Then wham a remake of one of his masterpieces sets a zombie craze in the modern cinema zeigeist.  Before you know it Universal Studios was begging Romero for a new zombie film and that's how Land of the Dead got green-lit.  Sure, it was Romero's first big studio movie(not counting his deal with Orion back in the late 80's and early 90's), but that also meant he had to leave some of his creative control behind. Not that that effected the film too much, it's great and the best of modern zombie film in my opinion.  The thing is now Romero works strictly independent.  But the problem is the only films he can get made are zombie films!!!!!  ARGGGGGGHHHH!  You know he loves the subject but I'm sure he wants to tell other stories and I wish someone would let him.  NO MORE ZOMBIES!  They're played out and Romero seems to have run out of things to say with them, which is evidenced by the lack of a message and more focus on Western fun in Survival of the Dead.  I wish I could fund his next non-zombie project....I bet it would be glorious.",4,"Romero just having fun, with less to say....",1302652800,"04 13, 2011",2011,5368,"['always', 'mind', 'so-called',

1342397,A391639ZYFGEI,B003EYVXYG,Donald Garon,"[4, 7]","First, I'd like to say I bought the Blu-Ray version of the movie.  I played it on a Sont BR player using an HDMI cable into a Sanyo 52' at 1080i.  It looks great! That being said, the movie itself, well, I think the consensus is that George has been slipping since Dawn.  Day was ok, Land a step lower, Diary aweful, and Survival? Just plain bad.  The premise is a good one - tracking a band of survivors as they seek to escape the horror that is unfolding around them.  Escape to an island - again, makes sense, good idea.  Once they get there though, it all falls apart. Feuding Irish clans?  On an island off the coast of Maryland?  Huh?  And each has radically different ideas about how to deal with the living dead problem.  One side wants to kill them, the other (get this) wants to keep them around until some form of cure comes along.  Now, much has been made about Romero's much vaunted ""social commentary.""  I've personally found it ameturish, sophmoric, and silly (and, inevitably leftish).  In the case of this movie, I know he's trying to say something, I just can't figure it out.  Pro life vs pro choice?  Money (in Romero parlance = greed) again makes an unintelligable appearance in this movie (see ""Land"") signifying, well I don't know as money could not have any possible use in a world that has completely collapsed. And zombie horseback riding?  Come on......  And once again (and this is by no means confined to this movie alone) the military is no realistically portrayed.  This should be an easy one to get right, but doesn't........BUT there are good aspects as well.  Romero has increasingly introduced the living dead ""rules"" into each of his movies, starting with NOTL.  The ideas that the living dead can, for instance, survive under water was introduced in Land but fleshed out a bit here.  The gore is there, although a couple times a bit cartoonish.Hey, I'm a die hard fan on the Living Dead movies, so of course I had to watch it.

""Survival of the Dead"" is the first sequel to the unnecessary zombie reboot, ""Diary of the Dead.""  The premise is that of a Hatfield/McCoy feud between two clans living on an isolated island somewhere off the Eastern seaboard.  Starting a few days after the initial zombie outbreak, the two factions fight over destroying the undead versus keeping them around in hopes of a ""cure.""  The ""shoot 'em on sight"" clan leader (Kenneth Welsh, badly wasted) is exiled, and repairs to the mainland where he encounters some of the Army raiders from Diary.  They find their way back to Plum Island, and the fun begins.The theme of course, is that humans treat each other far worse than any of the zombies - great subtext, but the A-story has to be engaging and unfortunately it's not.  There are some nuggets of good ideas - one soldier becomes zombified in a novel way - but the ""gags"" are not realized particularly well due to the low budget and flaky FX.It's a shame, because in the 70s-2000s there were YEARS without a decent zombie film.  Now flesh-eating undead are so ubiquitous we are numb to a new entry from the man who invented the genre.  It doesn't help that ""Survival of the Dead"" is just plain dull at times.I'll buy it because I appreciate the effort behind making a nonmainstream, independent film...but I think we need a few years' break until Mr. Romero gets a great idea.

For the most part people liked ""Land"" and just excepted it for what it was; people seem divided on ""Diary"" and as for this one well people kinda disliked it. Now I will say from jump right now that I have enjoyed all of them, honestly I have. I really liked all of them and that includes this one, do I like some more than others, of course. Where would this one rank, well I am sure most people could guess.This film is based on a solider you may have seen in the previous two ""Dead"" films, he is labeled something different in each but in the special features Romero says he is the same character. The film follows him and his group of comrades as they make their way to an Island off of the coast of Delaware. This island is home to two different families who hate each other; you know the classic blood feud story. The O'Flynn's want all zombies terminated while the Muldoon's are trying to round them up and save them for the day a cure is found. Seems like something is wrong on both sides but I [if this really happened] may be on the side called TEAM PEOPLE were we kill the zombies threat. Say what you want but they tried to kill Simon Pegg, and poor Nick frost was turned into one, that is unforgivable.When the military click happen upon a video thanks to a kid that tags along in which a man claims to have boats to get to an island off the shore line in Delaware, they make their way to it. After a very entertaining stand off with not only the man and his men at the boat place but with the dead as well they finally make it onto one and head over there. It is here that the real zombie killing begins and the fun begins as well, the blood feud is still very going on. O'Flynn came along for the ride to make it back home finally after being banished by Muldoon and is looking for his daughter and revenge.The film is really just that but with a lot of gore and death so it is still fun, especially for fans of this type of film. The film is not perfect and the flaws are there, this is not the best of the ""Dead"" films but with no expectations it is still kinda fun. I think it is a fun twist on an old story, kinda like the ""Pride & Prejudice & Zombies"" style books. The acting is good at least for the most part and every one seemed like they were having fun on this. O'Flynn was my favorite for some reason; he was just funny to me and his character was great.Speaking of that all of the acting seemed good, the characters and even the performances some times seemed 2-d but for the most part I kinda thought it was over the top good. Romero always has strong scripts and his direction is always great here I think he said ""I am just going to have fun with this one"". The reason I say that is because it feels a little more loose than his other works. Still I found it to be a good enough movie that does not match the earlier films but is still worth my dollar.This two disc version is excellent with loads of features, everything from featurettes to full length making of. Of course the always great commentary is a highlight on any film geeks list so you know I loved it. There are little shorts on here as well and many more things zombie fans will enjoy.

1342411,AK5F8RUC1DYZS,B003EYVXYG,Janet L. Rogers,"[6, 15]","I'll throw my two cents in. I loved this movie! Its my fave of his since he made Diary (wich is my fave of all the romero dead flicks).A lot of what I have heard is that people have problems with a few specific elements.1) A Zombie cant ride a horse. Ya well the dead cant walk and eat people either. And when yur talking about the activities of zombies... well... This is GAR. He made the rules, he can add to them if he wants to. PLUS if you take into consideration BUB from Day it is completly plausible to believe that a zombie would retain the ability to ride a horse. BUB remembered how to open a book, the motions of shaving. One might say, but this is something common place to our society. Okay, lets look at the gun. He cocks the gun and takes up a sloppy, but manageable firing stance. I think he may remeber that!2) There are no islands full of people of foreign descent off the coast of the US and if there were they sure as hell would retain their thick accents. Okay, maybe there isnt an island off the coast of the US like this, but ya know what, again, it comes back to the fact that a person can suspend disbelief enough to accept zombies, but an accent... Oh hell no. If anyone has ever been in cities with huge ethnic populations, it is conceivable, nay common, to have accents remain.I think a lot of what it comes down to is a feeling of ownership, especially with horror movies and their fans. So many feel that since they have grown up with these movies and adored the reels that they play from, that they have a feeling that they own a bit of it and therefore if it isn't something that they expect... or want for that matter that they feel betrayed by the filmmaker and the films they generate. Trying to tell Romero what a zombie can and cannot do, Well that is like trying tell the sun not shine.What I liked about this movie is the human element. The stubborn refusal to let go old grudges to take the proper steps and do what must be done. The seething hatred of a name and a family by the other is something that we see all the time in todays news. Oh it may not be a family, but certainly religions.... nationalities..... political parties. Thats what I think Romero was aiming at when he made this movie. Tackling the old grudges of political camps that are so entrenched in making sure that the other side doesn't get anything accomplished that they fail to see that they are indeed stalling and killing our economy. At the end of the day these aren't movies about zombies. These are movies about people and society that happen to feature zombies.Lets not loose focus on what these movies are trying to get across and why Romero makes his movies. He has a message to tell. Maybe thats what the problem is. Maybe, when we saw these films in our youths we couldn't grasp what Romero was doing, oh so slyly and as grown ups we gloss over the story and focus on the zombies. That is what we are obsessed with isn't it. The gore, effects. makeup, all that wonderfully goopy stuff we cheer for.Sadly I think that the horror viewing audience anymore, including myself on many occasions, are just to tired to think and to quick to hate. If we look at Romeros history, Day was hated by the general zombie fan public when it was first released for its decided lack of zombie action, but look at it today, and it is hailed as one of his best works, not only in zombies, but his entire filmography. Maybe time will be just as kind on Land, Diary and Survival. And to close out this little dissertation, lets face it people, we begged and begged for more Romero zombie tales and now we cry foul because we didnt get exactly what we want.

One side wants to kill zombies and be rid of them and the other keeps the zombie family members chained up in hopes of one day rehabing or curing them. All this takes place on an island.One of the selling points for me, for the DVD, was the George A. Romero interview extra. Romero explains how he would like to bring characters over from each of his zombie movies but they are all owned by different people and that means copyright payments. Romero is frustrated by the fact he wrote the movies but can't tell the zombie movie story he wants to put together and tell.I won't spoil a big part of the movie for you but the Obama Zombie Liberals want to rehab the zombies by teaching them to eat some kind of animal instead of humans!

1342416,A3F9VH8916IA40,B003EYVXYG,Jonathan &#34;Jimmy Dean&#34; Lane: libertari...,"[35, 48]","Diary of the Dead was Romero's attempt to cash in on the shaky cam craze while putting his own zombie mastermind spin on it. Although technically his fifth film in the living dead series, I never really considered it on the same field as Night, Dawn, Day and Land. It seemed more like a spin off film, an add on, to make a gaming analogy Diary of the Dead was a bonus pack, not a new game in and of itself. For me, and for many, many other long time Romero fans, Diary was a bitter disappointment. It lacked the grit and realism of Day and Land, and its characters were far from the well developed fleshed out human beings of Night and Dawn. Although not a terrible film, if failed utterly to live up to the greatness of Romero's other titles.Where Diary failed to live up to the living dead series, Survival not only does that, but pisses on everything Romero ever did right with it. I've been pissed off before watching movies by directors I once loved, but never like this. There is absolutely no redeeming quality for Survival of the Dead, nothing that could possibly save it from the dozens and dozens of hate reviews it will receive once the general public gets a hold of this piece of zombie trash. I've seen my fair share of bad zombie movies, anyone out there who can say the same knows that most are garbage, so you can understand the full meaning of when I say Survival of the Dead is probably, of its own right and not just compared to the original four movies, THE worst zombie film I have ever had the displeasure of seeing. Never before has such an idiotic film featuring zombies infected my DVD player with its idiocy the way this one has. Fine, think I'm exaggerating? Don't take my word for it, watch this abomination for yourself and see just how far the former master of living dead horror has fallen.The story starts out with the old line we know from Dawn of the Dead and reused in Diary of the Dead, ""everyone who dies gets up and kills, the people they kill get up and kill."" Its a classic, is it not? Who doesn't remember those frightened and half panicked newsmen shouting at one another in a crowded room, as the world turns to hell outside their doors? To this day its one of my favorite moments of the entire series. So, in spirit of this great scene, Romero puts these words in the mouth of some emo Snake Pliskin from Escape from New York wana be chain smoking idiotic Army National Guard sergeant played by THE most armature actor imaginable who drolls out his lines like he'd rather be somewhere else, reading some other script that someone with more talent put a little more time and effort into writing. In the first two minutes we get to see zombies sneak into the Army camp, somehow undetected by the guards, and bite the cheek off one hapless victim. Soon after our emo idiot sneaks off into the night with stupid trailer trash fat white guy, a horny sexy tough with a sensitive spot Latino girl, and a womanizer god fearing panzy Mexican. These three amego's and the token tough girl go AWOL, meeting up briefly with the *cough* 'hero's' of that Diary movie I mentioned earlier, before adding a brooding hotshot thinks he's all that teenager to the mix and running off in an armored truck to meet an old Scottish white guy who the brooding hotshot thinks he's all that teenager saw on his iphone who's promising people a chance to live on an island free of the ""dead heads"" in his best car salesman voice possible.It only gets worse from there on, but I digress. The biggest strengths of the original four movies were their focus on strong characters who's survival and interactions with one another were the real drama of the movies and NOT the zombies, and an underlying political or social message that tackled issues like racism and consumerism. Sure, the gore in Day was fun, and the comedy in Dawn was appreciated, but they aren't the focus of the films. With survival Romero presents us with a group of characters who are not only badly acted (VERY badly acted) but uninteresting, boring, and clich&eacute;. There is not a single character in this film, NOT A SINGLE ONE, that could get me to feel anything but hatred for them. I sighed with relief every time one of them bit the dust, relished their moments of demise since I wouldn't have to suffer through their idiocy any longer. If only ALL the characters had died... early in the movie... before saying a word... yeah, it would have been good had this film not been made in the first place. As for underlying political messages, Survival has one I guess, but its so heavy handed and indescribably mixed in with the convoluted story line that I couldn't make heads or tails about what it's really about. Is it about family feuds? Is it about respecting the dead? Is it about never killing? Is it about, oh gosh, I don't really care; the movie is terrible so any message it was trying to get out was lost in translation.Quick question; how hard is it to outrun a Romero zombie? I know he seems to do this in all his films, where people are running from zombies and are somehow caught, but it just gets absurd in this film. Everyone just sort of sits there and waits for the zombies to surround them before trying to get away, and then there's always that ONE zombie they didn't seem coming from behind who grabs them by the neck and takes a bite out of it. I yearn for the days when this was funny. It was in Dawn of the Dead when that Mexican guy in the hat got eaten up in the blood pressure machine, not so much in this film.But I'm rambling; I'll end my review with this. George A.

One always hopes for another classic of the same stature as NIGHT, DAWN, or even DAY OF THE LIVING DEAD but audiences should cut the guy a little slack and realize that no one can give them what they want every time out of the starting gate. I went into this flick expecting something that was absolutely unwatchable, and what I got was a film that (had it been from any other director) would have been regarded as an entertaining, effective horror flick. Romero however suffers from being  judged by other standards. But what of the film? Just some random thoughts there.In SURVIVAL Romero picks up temporally where DIARY OF THE DEAD left off since the story takes place approximately 6 days after the events depicted in that film. But thematically it harkens back to both NIGHT and LAND OF THE DEAD. At the finale of LAND OF THE DEAD his zombies pull a Garbo,  stalking off into the darkness, wanting nothing more than to be left alone. Unfortunately this raises the question of how they can possibly separate themselves from human beings when they depend upon them for their food source. In SURVIVAL Romero seems to be laying a foundation that will deal with this troublesome matter. But I found the greatest references in this film to be to NOTLD because it was in that seminal film that Romero first presented his human beings as having the potential to  be greater monsters than the zombies who were only fulfilling a new biological imperative to eat their own kind. The human beings on the other hand were engaged in meaningless struggles for equally meaningless power from the first moment that Ben and Harry faced off in that deserted farm house-- Power struggles that actually caused their  deaths. SURVIVAL's entire plot is built around the struggle for power between the patriarchs of two Irish clans on isolated Plum Island, and, as in NOTLD, this struggle for power causes everything to end tragically--although in the case of SURVIVAL it also serves to set up another potential film.Romero seems to be saying that while his zombies can evolve, we human beings are doomed to repeat our self-destructive behavior endlessly. If we aren't engaged in power struggles, doggedly determined to prove ourselves right no matter what the cost, then we're sadistic rednecks merrily engaged in torturing the undead just for fun--another recurring theme in his flix that has become magnified over the course of the series.  It seems a very pessimistic view of America (if not the world) but a quick peek at American politics serves to re-enforce that view. Who can forget Rush Limbaugh's statement that he wanted President Obama to fail, especially when you combine that with the Republican party's determination to oppose everything the Democrats propose? It can't help but make me think of Ben and Harry in the farm house surrounded by ravenous zombies. And Harry just has to have it his way.",3,Undead Ain't What It Used to Be,1286323200,"10 6, 2010",2010,3018,"['Forewarned', 'fore-armed', 'perhaps', 'best', 'way', 'view', 'George', 'Romero', 'latest', 'zombie', 'flick', 'SURVIVAL', 'THE', 'DEAD', 'One', 'always', 'classic', 'same', 'stature', 'NIGHT', 'DAWN', 'even', 'DAY', 'THE', 'LIVING', 'DEAD', 'audiences', 'should', 'cut', 'guy', 'little', 'slack', 'realize', 'one', 'can', 'give', 'what', 'want', 'time', 'starting', 'gate', 'went', 'flick', 'expecting', 'something', 'was', 'absolutely', 'unwatchable', 'what', 'got', 'was', 'film', 'had', 'been', 'other', 'director', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'regarded', 'entertaining', 'effective', 'horror', 'flick', 'Romero', 'however', 'being', 'judged', 'other', 'standards', 'what', 'film', 'Just', 'random', 'thoughts', 'there.In', 'SURVIVAL', 'Romero', 'up', 'temporally', 'where', 'DIARY', 'THE', 'DEAD', 'left', 'off', 'story', 'place', 'approximately', '6', 'days', 'events', 'depicted', 'film', 'thematically', 'back', 'NIGHT', 'LAND', 'OF', 'THE', 'DEAD', 'finale', 'LAND', 'OF', 'THE', 'DEAD', 'zombies', 'pull', 'Garbo', 'stalking', 'off', 'darkness', 'wanting', 'nothing', 'more', 'be', 'left', 'alone', 'Unfortunately', 'question', 'how', 'can', 'possibly', 'separate', 'human', 'beings', 'when', 'depend', 'food', 'source', 'SURVIVAL', 'Romero', 'be', 'laying', 'foundation', 'will', 'deal', 'troublesome', 'matter', 'found', 'greatest', 'references', 'film', 'be', 'NOTLD', 'was', 'seminal', 'film', 'Romero', 'first', 'presented', 'human', 'beings', 'having', 'potential', 'be', 'greater', 'monsters', 'zombies', 'who', 'were', 'only', 'fulfilling', 'new', 'biological', 'imperative', 'eat', 'own', 'kind', 'human', 'beings', 'other', 'hand', 'were', 'engaged', 'meaningless', 'struggles', 'equally', 'meaningless', 'power', 'first', 'moment', 'Ben', 'Harry', 'faced', 'off', 'deserted', 'farm', 'house', 'Power', 'actually', 'caused', 'deaths', 'SURVIVAL', 'entire', 'plot', 'built', 'struggle', 'power', 'patriarchs', 'two', 'Irish', 'clans', 'isolated', 'Plum', 'Island', 'NOTLD', 'struggle', 'power', 'causes', 'everything', 'end', 'tragically', 'case', 'SURVIVAL', 'also', 'set', 'up', 'potential', 'film.Romero', 'be', 'saying', 'zombies', 'can', 'evolve', 'human', 'beings', 'are', 'doomed', 'repeat', 'self-destructive', 'behavior', 'endlessly', 'are', ""n't"", 'engaged', 'power', 'struggles', 'doggedly', 'determined', 'prove', 'right', 'matter', 'what', 'cost', 'then', ""'re"", 'sadistic', 'rednecks', 'merrily', 'engaged', 'torturing', 'undead', 'just', 'fun', 'recurring', 'theme', 'flix', 'become', 'magnified', 'course', 'series', 'very', 'pessimistic', 'view', 'America', 'not', 'world', 'quick', 'peek', 'American', 'politics', 'serves', 're-enforce', 'view', 'Who', 'can', 'forget', 'Rush', 'Limbaugh', 'statement', 'wanted', 'President', 'Obama', 'fail', 'especially', 'when', 'combine', 'Republican', 'party', 'determination', 'oppose', 'everything', 'Democrats', 'propose', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'make', 'think', 'Ben', 'Harry', 'farm', 'house', 'surrounded', 'ravenous', 'zombies', 'Harry', 'just', 'have', 'way']",N/A

It was a good solid horror movie. Interesting with good characters and the acting was above average. Regarding the CGI effects, I felt that two of them were not that good (the heads on the spikes and the fellows head being completely blown off) but they were not that bad and certainly did little to take away from the overall film. Too many individuals,I believe, are upset that this isn't Dawn of the Dead (1978) and I don't believe this film was as good as Dawn of the Dead (which I consider to be the best horror film ever made) but that does not mean this is not a good film. That would be like attacking every film that Martin Scorsese makes and complaining that it wasn't Taxi Driver. The film had a very professional look, beautifully photographed and sure didn't seem like a movie that was made for 4 million dollars. I am dying for some studio to give Romero a 100 million dollars and letting him make the epic living dead movie of all time (it could happen).

However, right from the start, I had a feeling that the master of the undead had lost his touch with this one. The tale mixes in your basic macho, swearing, smoking military types who never flinch when they see a zombie. Their always cool, collected and light their butts on the flaming head of the undead before they karate kick the corps into a river. Couple this with bad jokes that are supposed to make the film funny, but fail.. And the irish talking cowboys that live on an island off the coast of delaware and you have mixed bag of cardboard characters and a healthy dose of unrealism that set the stage for a pretty sloppy movie. It seemed like Romero wanted to set his new movie in the old west, but wasn't able to do so because of the undead timeline of his previous works. So he invented a group of characters that lived in the modern day, but were gross throwbacks to a time beyond the new modern era. Imagine people in 2010 dressing like cowboys, riding horses and speaking with perfect irish accents. The zombies were nothing more than a poor backdrop to the thin storyline of this movie.. On the whole, this movie was not about survivors trying to prolong their lives during the zombie uprising.. it was about a ridiculous feud between two families and the living dead were just another ingredient in the stew. Maybe this one will grow on me as I view it again in the future, some movies are like that. But I can't give this one high marks right from the starting gate.

Dawn of the Dead holds up to this very day as a valid and powerful commentary on consumerism and one of the finest films the genre has to offer.  Day of the Dead, though poorly received upon initial release, garnered a considerable reputation for itself and is considered by some the best of the series.  I even believe that with some time, the lukewarm feelings toward Land of the Dead will become more favorable and it will be seen as a decent enough entry in Romero's Dead universe, though not nearly on the same level as the three films preceding it.  Then came Diary of the Dead, which seemed more focused on capitalizing on the POV filmmaking boom than on having any relevant social commentary.  All things considered, for as poor as that movie comes across, it seems miles ahead of Romero's latest offering.  Many want to make the argument that Romero's two or three latest films have been battered by poorer reviews but will eventually be considered gems in some years, much akin to Day of the Dead.  I would suggest that these recent films have seen increasingly less favorable returns since 1985 because Romero has been making exponentially less appealing films in the time since, Survival of the Dead being easily the worst of the bunch.  No amount of hindsight could make this a good movie, Romero or no.Had Survival of the Dead been written and directed by anyone else, it would have been here and gone with little or no fanfare.  It is, without question, an almost entirely forgettable film.  However, with the name George Romero attached, Survival immediately gains a measure of credibility among the horror community.  As someone who has seen every Romero film and considers him an artistic influence, I can safely say that the Romero brand cannot lend this film any credit, and may even signal that Romero's days of making films with a purpose are over.  Which would be fine if Survival of the Dead were even a fun outing, or if there was a modicum of entertainment value to be had from viewing this film.  Unfortunately, this is not the case.  Survival of the Dead, quite frankly, is an exercise in patience.  It is a frustrating film to watch, and it is almost entirely without merit.  And I think the name Romero is partially to blame, because it is well documented that George Romero can make a fine film that is enjoyable and says something about mankind all at once, and this film fails brilliantly to do either.  Had the man who created our morbid fascination with the living dead forty odd years ago not been the one at the helm of this train wreck, it would have been scrapped and junked and few would have bothered to look for survivors.  Because of that name value, the film is subject to far more scrutiny, but this particular wreck is nonetheless lacking for salvageable pieces.Here, Romero has planted his theme: conflict between warring factions.  The two families on the island have opposing views on the matter of how to deal with their dead.  Which seems like a decent enough starting point, although there is a glaring flaw: both faction leaders are intolerable human beings, which falls right into Romero's oft used gray scale of character morality, but certainly isn't helped by the fact the viewer can't be bothered to care on account of the characters being so bereft of motivation or logic and the actors portraying them being so overwhelmingly unequipped.  They are not intolerable because they are written that way insomuch as the actors portraying them do so poorly at selling their characters that they are nearly unwatchable.  The problem here is that there is no one even remotely interesting or sympathetic of the entire cast of characters.  There is no complexity to any character: they are either a bad guy, a slightly more thinly veiled bad guy, utterly moronic, or completely useless.  The characters in this film consistently make ridiculous choices and act in utterly irrational fashion for the simple purpose of moving the plot along.  Sure, in Romero's previous efforts, characters are morally ambiguous and make bad decisions, but their decisions have weight and the repercussions fit the actions.  No decision in Survival of the Dead feels like it means anything.  Things happen simply to get the film from point A to point B, which makes for lazy storytelling and a lackluster film.  There is a wide berth of difference between Romero's original trilogy and this particular film: there is no sense of dread to be found, no sense of loss of humanity, nothing remotely close to vitriol and transgression, nothing new we learn about ourselves as a culture, and--nearly as important--nothing to draw the viewer into the narrative.But let's throw that all out the window.  Let's assume that Romero has conceded that he can no longer write characters as strong as Ben, Fran, or Rhodes.  That he cannot create characters that are more than trope or stock, characters that may represent something a little more.  Let's assume he doesn't try so hard to sell his characters in this film as representatives to some greater meaning.  That this film is simply a fun exhibition of post-apocalyptic gore tableaux.  It even fails there.  Romero, so well known for taking practical effects and putting them to great use, relies almost entirely on CGI.  In a commentary track on the Dawn of the Dead U.S. Theatrical Cut, Romero says he feels CGI is better suited for effects that cannot be done practically (and furthermore, if something sounds impossible to do convincingly with practical effects, it probably is) or to enhance practical effects.  He says that the viewer should never feel like they are watching effects, that there is no need to abuse CGI in his films because he is not making a movie about dinosaurs, and that CGI should never be the star of the film.  To be fair, CGI is far from the star here, because the effects work is atrocious.  The viewer will not only be absolutely aware that they are watching bad CGI, they will most likely be taken entirely out of the film because of how bad it is.There are a number of gags that are entirely too laughable and unbelievable, testing even the strongest suspension of disbelief.  The very fact that Romero saw these scenes in post-production and gave them a thumbs up draws questions to whether or not he recalls what made his first three films so successful.  This isn't to say that Romero hasn't employed humor in his films, but there is something distinctly different between raiders engaging in a pie fight with zombies as they pillage a mall and a grenade blowing up the wall of a building and leaving those pressed behind it covered in soot like cartoon characters.  Both sound rather silly, but Dawn's gags and pratfalls seemed to fit in the context of the film, and was often a means to give the viewer a break from the film's overall bleak tone.  The latter gag isn't funny because it was intended to be, rather it is comical (but moreover depressing) that a man who generally deals in subtlety and nuance would think that a Daffy Duck pratfall would fit perfectly in the middle of his latest zombie allegory flick.  It would be a different issue entirely if Romero had made this film with the intention of being Looney Toons with zombies, but his focus seems too centralized upon making another film with something to say about us as a whole, and these gags are all the more ridiculous when the film fails to have anything to say.And as far as subtlety goes, Romero here has lost any grasp he had on the notion.  His theme here is man against man.  This is clear because he bludgeons the viewer over the head with the idea.  But it's not even an entirely interesting or new one, as the idea that we are the enemy has been a main thread in every Dead film he has helmed, and used to better effect in previous films.  But his previous films expanded on those ideas.  Night of the Living Dead made subtle allusion to Vietnam and the Civil Rights movement.  Dawn of the Dead questioned our obsession with owning things.  Day of the Dead asked whether it was necessary to know the answers to unanswerable questions if we must sacrifice our humanity to achieve that knowledge.  Land of the Dead focused on terrorism and the Bush Doctrine.  Even Diary of the Dead could be considered a statement about our dependency of technology and media.  Survival of the Dead has nothing subtle, nothing nuanced.  From the first scene to the final shot, Romero wields his message like a whooping stick, not content to sheathe it until the point has been beaten firmly into the viewers' skulls.  Here, Romero has traded in that skill, or he doesn't trust his audience to draw their own conclusions.  Like Diary, Survival ends with a ridiculous shot guided by voice over that is intended to provide the viewer with their catharsis.  Here, he drives home that so long as there are men, they will fight, and that the stubborn will carry their ideas with them to their graves (and, as he shows, beyond).  But given the awful execution of the rest of the film prior to that final ""payoff"", the fact that Romero's overall message is rather one-dimensional, unrefined, and has been done before (and, again, better) in his previous films is far more unforgivable.Survival of the Dead also continues Romero's downward trend in terms of casting and getting good performances from his actors.  No one in this film turns in a good role.  No one.  Every performance, like the characters, is throwaway.  It would be another thing entirely if a character was written to be over the top and the actor/actress portraying them did their job in making that character believable or selling the viewer on the idea that it is just that character's nature.  Look at Judith O'Dea's Barbara, one minute hysterical and another catatonic, played with just the right touch (and at times a little too much) melodrama.  Look at Joe Pilato's Captain Rhodes, almost a comic book villain, the prototypical career military man whose power has gone to his head.  For their films, they worked.  But here, everyone falls flat.  There is no strong lead.  There isn't even much in the way of a primary character.  Everyone simply blends in while the audience waits for them to kill something (sometimes in absolutely ridiculous fashion) or be killed.Perhaps we were spoiled by his other films.  Take Dawn of the Dead for example.  Every character has a purpose, and every character connects with the audience.  Roger, calm and collected, then at once fervent and violent.  Peter, the center, the backbone, a man who does morally ambiguous things at times but is all together genuine and strong.  Fran, assertive, the one who grows past the assumed role of den mother and learns to become every bit the valuable asset her cohorts are, all while facing down bringing a child into the world and the crushing reality of what their existence in the mall is turning them into.  Stephen, simpering and feeble at times, yet invaluable because of his skill, always trying to be one of the boys and coming across at times as mildly misogynist.  Even the mall itself is a character, the constant temptress.Here, decades and miles away, Survival of the Dead has no character and none of the requisite charm of Romero's trilogy.  Again, the characters are simply tools to prod along Romero's idea, one that even he doesn't quite know how to put to film.  In the same commentary track I mentioned before, Romero specifies that the characters come to him naturally after he gets his idea.  Here, not even the idea was fully realized, which makes it far less excusable to present a group of characters without any meaning or use.  But despite it all, a film without subtext can still succeed.  If a film has a middling plot but characters to drive it, or an exceptional plot with uninteresting characters, it still struggles to qualify itself as a good film, even if it has one piece of the puzzle in place.  It just so happens that Romero has made his reputation by being savvy and smart with metaphor and delivering an enjoyable picture to encapsulate that message.  With Survival of the Dead, everything is lacking.  Quite simply, George Romero has made a terrible film in the sub-genre he created.With this film, Romero acts as something of the old grandfather he looks to be.  He pulls you into his lap and tells you a story about how way back when, when he was a younger man, he made some movies about zombies.  And they were great films.  And your grandfather, well, he started something.  And Grandpa George has seen so many people in those years since take that idea that he created and have their way with it, for better or worse.  So it occurred to him that he did it better than anyone else (and he did, mind you), so what's to stop him from doing it better again?  And he tries, but it isn't the same, and it turns out that Grandpa George not only can't make 'em like he used to, but what he's turning out today isn't nearly as good as what some others are doing with a fifth of the experience and a tenth the prestige.  That for as hip and with the times as George tries to be, he's not that young man anymore who made those amazing films.  But you'll permit him his mistakes, because you love your grandfather.And I love George Romero, for he is very much the grandfather of not only the modern idea of the zombie, but of the thinking man's horror film.  I would love to see another Romero film on par with Night, Dawn, or Day.  I would love to sit back in wonder and watch George weave his magic one more time.  But Survival of the Dead seems to be a loud and clear death knell for that possibility.  Because Survival of the Dead is most certainly not that film.  The absolute fact of the matter is this: George cannot do it like he once did, and Survival of the Dead is very much a horrible film that proves this point.  It appears that his sense of style and ingenuity has atrophied, dried up, and blown away on the wind.  In the last few years, George Romero has made acceptable to bad films while others around him, no doubt influenced by him, have done it much better.  And even with those very good zombie films, the truth is that it is an absolutely unapproachable task to try and top the relevance and brilliance of Romero's Dead trilogy.  Even for the man himself.  Survival of the Dead would be a woefully inadequate attempt to follow up on that brilliance for a relative newcomer, never mind the complete catastrophe it is having been dealt by the hand of George Romero himself.",1,A Film With Zombies and Little Else...,1283385600,"09 2, 2010",2010,14733,"['George', 'Romero', 'zombie', 'films', 'tend', 'age', 'extremely', 'well', 'Night', 'Living', 'Dead',

I praise him for not falling into what people ""believe"" to be the evolution of the zombie film and continuing down his own path; sticking to his original view and that over time zombies ""can"" in theory learn and/or recall part of their past life.  He balances action and dialogue WITH zombies very well and never focuses too long on people yelling at each other or excessive character development.  It is a zombie film that doesn't forget that i am here to see ZOMBIES!No shaky cam thank goodness!  I am so very sick of shaky cam and yelling as a pathetic attempt to create tension or suspense and love his ability to make you feel that the zombies are a threat, not just a target for cool people to look cool by shooting them or bashing their heads in. It is lighthearted at times, but never overburdens the overall film.The effects are the now trademark mixed bag of very good practical and CG, but it is no more silly than movies that people would try suggest as being ""better"", i believe that many people only use this as an excuse, since many films others think are ""the greatest"" i find the CG in as ""laughable"" so we shall negate the CG argument.  Other than these moments, the practical effects and zombies look great and are very memorable.  You will likely not find zombie A and zombie B blending in to a forgettable sea of ""those things that we must look cool while killing""  They are as distinguishable as the main cast.  The package ends up being a good blend of style and story with zombies and very pleasing to watch... and even repeat view.Not 5 stars, since i do count CG as evil and it is not over the top perfection.  As a 25 year fan of zombies i highly recommend this movie and find it holds true to what i find appealing about them as well as do justice to his original development or evolution of the zombie as a whole without making them run flailing their arms and silly while shaking the camera.

Some of which are pretty good and some are bad in the effects arena. (by todays standards not tenyears ago, I can't stand people who complain about the effects of a older movie. that's completely lame).  One thing that's different here is that for some reason several characters are concerned about millions of dollars. In a disaster world paper money is only good for wiping ones butt, silver and gold retain some value only if there's enough to eat though. Anyways the acting is fine here but the money is gone for poor george who must make do with what he has effects wise.  This is not a one star movie though, it is Romero and although I like bigger stories than this like ""dawn of the dead' which is a classic or the original 'night of the living dead' alot better this story about fueding families on a island still has some resonance. Although in a zombie world you'd have lots of supplies all over the place so I can't see people always gunning for each other. Every living person is someone who can take out a zombie after all.This looks best on blu ray and it has extras but no deleted scenes. I have all the dead series on blu ray including the other variant strains so I had to have this one.

Before The Walking Dead did it, George A. Romero's ""Survival of the Dead"" did it first.Our crew of formerly upstanding citizens includes Sergeant Nicotine Crockett (Alan van Sprang), Kenny (Eric Woolfe), Francisco (Stefano Colacitti) and Tomboy (Athena Karkanis).  The farmstead is led by two rival patriarchs: Patrick O'Flynn (Kenneth Welsh) who believes all zombies should be killed and Seamus Muldoon (Richard Fitzpatrick) who believes all zombies should be protected until a cure is found. SPOILER OF THE DEAD: There's also Patrick's twin daughters, Janet (Kathleen Munroe) and Jane (played by, uh, Kathleen Munroe).Our ragtag band of warriors are less interested in politics and more in survival, but it's not long before they are caught up in the conflict between the O'Flynns and Muldoons.  Characters die, zombies bite, and the two rival families continue their civil war despite the apocalypse raging on around them.  Depending on your perspective, this either makes their hatred of each other truly spectacular or spotlights just how petty their rivalry really is.Romero, who at this point seems to be shambling through his own zombie films, adds a few new touches to the genre he helped invent.  But mostly this is a film about two Irish guys acting like anachronistic Hatfields and McCoys, pursuing some vendetta that no longer makes any sense to anybody, including the audience.  It all feels a little pointless, and Romero is only too happy to leave things that way.As the latest chapter in Romero's zombie series it's a bit more effective -- everyone seems to think escaping to an Island is the ideal way to restart humanity, but as ""Survival of the Dead"" makes clear, humanity's biggest problem is itself.

This movie just feels real weak compared to all previous entries, in fact the zombies barely play a part and there's no scenes that will have you jumping, Yes it could be to do with the budget of only 4 million but Romero's never really had big budgets before and after all ""Diary Of The Dead"" only had a budget of 2 million.The movie basically picks up where the last movie ends in that a bunch of renegade soldiers rob the belongings of the cast of ""Diary Of The Dead"", while this is going on there's a war going on an island that is supposed to be zombie free. Of course everyone will descend on to this island and battle the zombies, but unfortunately it doesn't work that way and the story turns into who gets control of the island and the Zombies are really only in the background.There is no extras included and the movie has a dated feel to it and if Romero's name wasn't attached to it we probably won't make it till the end.

I thought it was better than the last two Romero movies, but then that is not saying much at all because I thought both of those films were terrible, especially Diary of the Dead, which I think is the worst film Romero ever made. Im not going to pretend this wasnt a bad movie, it wasnt really all that great, but it also was not that horribly bad. I kept trying to think of this movie as if it had been released in the mid 70s. If it had been I think people would have liked it a lot more. The humor in this movie was one thing people really seemed to despise, but it actually wasnt as hokey as some of the funny moments Romero had put in Dawn of the Dead, still a good deal of the humor was still pretty cheesy here. But there were some effective moments here and there and an underlying mood of mildly grim style to this I actually sort of liked. I really expected this movie to be so bad I would turn it off within a half hour, but it kept my interest for the most part. As far as Zombie films go this one ranks pretty low in my book, but its also better than others I have seen. There are a lot of bad Zombie films out there and this one while obviously pretty weak is not as bad and many I have seen. But no its not even close to as good as Romeros first three zombie films, but still worth seeing if your a die hard Romero fan, just to see what ideas he came up with this time.

It involved the renegade national guardsmen from Diary finding their way to an island off the coast of Delaware which has two Irish clans fighting each other over what to do with the dead.  Strangely, only a handful of people spoke with Irish accents, the rest didn't even bother.  What hurts the movie is the contradictions throughout.  One minute the guardsmen say money is worthless, then they are fighting over a million dollars.  One of the clans wants to keep the zombies(dead heads in the movie) alive, but later on are shooting them left and right.  Also parts of the movie act like the world is completely lawless after 6 days of the dead rising, while other parts have internet and television still being broadcast.  I can go on and on.  The zombie makeup is fair, but sometimes is looks too much like makeup.  The acting runs from fair to poor.  The CGI is terrible and really fake looking.

1342449,A2EDZH51XHFA9B,B003EYVXYG,"Robert Beveridge ""xterminal""","[0, 3]","Survival of the Dead (George A. Romero, 2009)Diary of the Dead was, while not exactly a banner moment in George A. Romero's career, his best film in nigh on two decades (longer if you were one of the thousands who didn't like Monkey Shines nearly as much as I did). So, given that, what was his next move? Take a minor character from the movie, who appears very briefly, and make him the star of the next attempt to beat that (un)dead horse for just a little more cash. And I will admit (and I have said this before, specifically about Mr. Romero even) that if this were not a George A. Romero zombie movie, I would probably not have hated it nearly as much as I did. But in this case, I'm not sure that argument applies, because I'm not sure that anyone other than George Romero could have made Survival of the Dead. Which makes it even more painful to say that this movie is, to date, the nadir of Romero's career--and I say this as someone who sat through both There's Always Vanilla and Jack's Wife.Plot: Nick Crockett (Immortals' Alan van Sprang), whom we last saw shaking down the film crew in Diary of the Dead, is leading a ragtag band of ex-military types through the zombified landscape, living off their wits, when they stumble upon a radio transmission straight out of 28 Days Later... advertising a zombie-free island. They decide to check it out and, to make a long story short, find themselves stuck in the middle of a long-standing feud between the island's two patriarchs, Patrick O'Flynn (The Aviator's Kenneth Welsh) and Seamus Muldoon (The Boondock Saints' Richard Fitzpatrick), one of whom wants to eradicate the island's undead inhabitants, the other trying to find a way to restore their humanity.In short: take everything you loved about Dawn of the Dead and elevate it to parody levels. Thirty-five years ago, Dawn's brilliant, hilarious, over-the-top gore sequences were accents that pinned together a story with just enough social consciousness to leave a bitter taste in the mouth, with enough rough edges to abrade without ever cutting. Here, we find that the outrageous gore sequences aren't accents, they've become the entire story, with the social consciousness aspect of the film relegated to one scene at the end that's just painful to watch.

The theory does work but in a typical Romero ironic twist-the only person to witness the breakthrough is shot dead.The movie is not boring, just a little tired and after awhile watching the back of a zombies head blow out after being shot grows old really fast and the exploding head by shotgun blast has been seen once too often.Note to George A Romero--time to put the zombies to rest-or maybe a combination, say like, ""The Living Dead Eat The Crazies"" Ahhhh-maybe not.",3,BARELY SURVIVING,1284163200,"09 11, 2010",2010,1330,"['George', 'A.', 'Romero', 'passion', 'living', 'dead', 'Zombies', 'Flesh', 'eating', 'zombies', 'getting', 'tired', 'should', 'have', 'shelved', 'cadavers', 'Night-Dawn', 'Day', 'am', 'afraid', 'day', 'will', 'see', 'posthumus', 'Romero', 'zombie', 'flick', 'Director', 'Dead', '.The', 'movie', 'place', 'Plum', 'Island', 'am', 'assuming', 'small', 'island', 'somewhere', 'U.S.', 'Coast', 'two', 'feuding', 'families', 'sort', 'Irish', 'Hatfield', 'McCoys', 'Irish', 'complete', 'brogues', 'guess', 'way', 'U.S.', 'Coast-like', 'maybe', 'closer', 'Ireland', 'Anyhow', 'families', 'have', 'stubborn', 'knuckle-headed', 'patriachs-the', ""O'Flynns"", 'believe', 'only', 'good', 'zombie', 'shot', 'head', 'zombie', 'Papa', 'Muldoon', 'theory', 'zombies', 'could', 'be', 'motivated', 'eat', 'living', 'animal', 'other', 'human-maybe', 'would', 'save', 'mankind', 'theory', 'work', 'typical', 'Romero', 'ironic', 'twist-the', 'only', 'person', 'witness', 'breakthrough', 'shot', 'dead.The', 'movie', 'not', 'boring', 'just', 'little', 'tired', 'awhile', 'watching', 'back', 'zombies', 'head', 'blow', 'out', 'being', 'shot', 'grows', 'old', 'really', 'fast', 'exploding', 'head', 'shotgun', 'blast', 'been', 'seen', 'once', 'too', 'often.Note', 'George', 'A', 'Romero', 'time', 'put', 'zombies', 'rest-or', 'maybe', 'combination', 'say', 'Living', 'Dead', 'Eat', 'Crazies', 'Ahhhh-maybe', 'not']",N/A

And as it turned out, Survival of the Dead was, quite simply put, dumb. But ya gotta throw an extra star at the guy that started it all back in 1968, right?Romero allows a 2004 top notch remake ofDawn of the Deadby Zack Snyder that takes the zombies to a new level: they're really vicious, they run, they seem a little smarter, and (yuck) they can give birth. Then the following year, in Romero'sLand of the Dead, the zombies seem to have forgotten how to run but now they are even smarter than in the Dawn remake. They're like ""learning zombies"". And that's the concept Romero goes with in Survival. Plus in Survival of the Dead there's this whole Hatfield versus McCoy's-esque thing going on, which to me was just a distraction from what I was really here for: Zombies chasing people around in a world gone mad. But no, the ""When Zombies Attack"" theme is overshadowed by this family feud that occurs on a remote island that 4 survivors from the mainland (including one that first appeared in 2007's Diary of the Dead) try to make it to after hearing that it might be a safe haven from the zombie infested world.I thought that the 1990 remake ofNight of the Living Deadwas terrific. Survival was fun, and it was probably better than the forgettableDiary of the Dead, but it was a step away from the realistic situations predominant in the more recent versions of Night of and Dawn of. (Wait a minute...realistic situations...the walking dead...???)Oh, speaking of ""the walking dead""...are you familiar with the comic book seriesThe Walking Dead? If not you're missing out on a fabulous spinoff of Night of the Living Dead. Don't like comic books or graphic novels? Well you're in luck because AMC started converting the comic books into a series in the fall of 2010; theFirst Seasonwas all headed up byFrank Darabont...and the show is great.

A friend of mine summed it up by saying that there should be a law passed by congress that no zombie films can be produced, in Hollywood(especially) or independently, for at least a decade.  With zombies in T.V commercials, every video game including a ""zombie mode"", eight billion zombie novels appearing on the shelves(including those atrocious cutesy zombie survival guides), a television show(which really is much better than I thought it would be oddly enough), and even making appearances on Spongebob Squarepants, how can it not all fall into parody?  Every zombie film that comes out anymore seems to be a comedy!  How do you bring the creepiness or seriousness back to the genre?  Zombie movies have always been a kind of taboo, gruesome movies that only weird horror people watched.  I have no problem with the zombie film getting more exposure and becoming more acceptable, but it seems that whenever that happens to a genre or idea, it soon becomes overkill and almost immediately turns to crap, especially when Hollywood goes in for a piece of the action.Sorry, I didn't intend to rant about all this for so long, but I can't help it when zombie movies are the hot topic.So, what's with this Romero movie everybody's bitching about?  Well, I gotta say that Survival of the Dead isn't quite as bad as it's reputation would have you believe.  The problem is that it's Romero.  We count on Romero to give us the great zombie film that will stomp all the wannabees to dust, to show us all how it's REALLY done.  Problem is, is that he's buried in a sea of his own imitators, most of them bad.  And Land of the Dead, Diary and Survival come across to horror fans like Lucas' last Three Star Wars movies come across to Sci-Fi fans.  What could Romero possibly do to follow up three classic films, especially after such a hiatus that allowed their legacy to grow.The sad fact is that Survival comes across like a straight-to-video or made-for-SyFy movie.  An above average one, in my opinion, but a run of the mill one nonetheless, and that's not what we expect from Romero.The story follows a rogue group of soldiers looking for their own private piece of the world, and think they've found it in a New England coastal island, but a Hatfield/McCoy-ish civil war is going on there.  One family, led by Kenneth Welsh(who I loved in Twin Peaks, and is a dead ringer for Terence Stamp) wants to wipe all zombies out and make the island a safehaven, while the opposing family are religious nuts who want to keep the dead ""alive"" and chained.  Why?  To try to get them to acquire an appetite for another meat besides human.  The zombies don't seem to comply when horses and other animals are served to them, so the zombies spend much of their time doing manual labor and chores around the farm.  It's an extension on ideas put forth in Day of the Dead.Once the soldiers and Welsh(who had been exiled) come to the island, a war is waged.  Like I said before, I really don't think this movie was all that bad.  No, the cast isn't full of DeNiros, Romero has started using CG since Land(which is probably my biggest complaint as it makes it look all the more SyFy channel-ish, and is just a flat out sin amongst horror fans, right on par with the running zombies), the social message isn't as strong, gore is minimal, and a twist involving an identical twin sister will make you roll your eyes.Even with all of that, I'll take this movie over 100 Zombielands and 1,000,000 Resident Evils.  I don't think Romero has ""lost it"", I just think he's stuck in a Catch 22 type situation with the way the film industry is now and a genre that has been all but ruined.",4,Survival Of A Genre?,1334448000,"04 15, 2012",2012,3851,"['truly', 'sign', 'when', 'George', 'Romero', 'can', 'no', 'longer', 'make', 'terrific', 'zombie', 'film', 'anymore', 'whole', 'zombie', 'craze', 'B.S', 'world', 'last', '8', 'years', 'so', '.well', 'dead', 'friend', 'mine', 'summed', 'up', 'saying', 'should', 'be', 'law', 'passed', 'congress', 'zombie', 'films', 'can', 'be', 'produced', 'Hollywood', 'especially', 'independently', 'least', 'decade', 'zombies', 'T.V', 'commercials', 'video', 'game', 'including', 'zombie', 'mode', 'eight', 'billion', 'zombie', 'novels', 'appearing', 'shelves', 'including', 'atrocious', 'cutesy', 'zombie', 'survival', 'guides', 'television', 'show', 'really', 'much', 'better', 'thought', 'would', 'be', 'oddly', 'enough', 'even', 'making', 'appearances', 'Spongebob', 'Squarepants', 'how', 'can', 'not', 'fall', 'parody', 'Every', 'zombie', 'film', 'out', 'anymore', 'be', 'comedy', 'How', 'do', 'bring', 'creepiness', 'seriousness', 'back', 'genre', 'Zombie', 'movies', 'have', 'always', 'been', 'kind', 'taboo', 'gruesome', 'movies', 'only', 'weird', 'horror', 'people', 'watched', 'have', 'problem', 'zombie', 'film', 'getting', 'more', 'exposure', 'becoming', 'more', 'acceptable', 'whenever', 'genre', 'idea', 'soon', 'overkill', 'almost', 'immediately', 'crap', 'especially', 'when', 'Hollywood', 'piece', 'action.Sorry', 'did', ""n't"", 'intend', 'rant', 'so', 'long', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'when', 'zombie', 'movies', 'are', 'hot', 'topic.So', 'what', 'Romero', 'movie', 'everybody', 'bitching', 'Well', 'got', 'ta', 'say', 'Survival', 'Dead', ""n't"", 'quite', 'as', 'bad', 'reputation', 'would', 'have', 'believe', 'problem', 'Romero', 'count', 'Romero', 'give', 'great', 'zombie', 'film', 'will', 'stomp', 'wannabees', 'dust', 'show', 'how', 'REALLY', 'done', 'Problem', 'buried', 'sea', 'own', 'imitators', 'most', 'bad', 'Land', 'Dead', 'Diary', 'Survival', 'come', 'horror', 'fans', 'Lucas', 'last', 'Three', 'Star', 'Wars', 'movies', 'come', 'Sci-Fi', 'fans', 'What', 'could', 'Romero', 'possibly', 'do', 'follow', 'up', 'three', 'classic', 'films', 'especially', 'such', 'hiatus', 'allowed', 'legacy', 'grow.The', 'sad', 'fact', 'Survival', 'straight-to-video', 'made-for-SyFy', 'movie', 'above', 'average', 'one', 'opinion', 'run', 'mill', 'one', 'nonetheless', 'not', 'what', 'expect', 'Romero.The', 'story', 'rogue', 'group', 'soldiers', 'looking', 'own', 'private', 'piece', 'world', 'think', ""'ve"", 'found', 'New', 'England', 'coastal', 'island', 'Hatfield/McCoy-ish', 'civil', 'war', 'going', 'One', 'family', 'led', 'Kenneth', 'Welsh', 'who', 'loved', 'Twin', 'Peaks', 'dead', 'ringer', 'Terence', 'Stamp', 'wipe', 'zombies', 'out', 'make', 'island', 'safehaven', 'opposing', 'family', 'are', 'religious', 'nuts', 'who', 'want', 'keep', 'dead', 'alive', 'chained', 'Why', 'try', 'get', 'acquire', 'appetite', 'meat', 'human', 'zombies', 'do', ""n't"", 'seem', 'comply', 'when', 'horses', 'other', 'animals', 'are', 'served', 'zombies', 'spend', 'much', 'time', 'doing', 'manual', 'labor', 'chores', 'farm', 'extension', 'ideas', 'put', 'forth', 'Day', 'Dead.Once', 'soldiers', 'Welsh', 'who', 'had', 'been', 'exiled', 'come', 'island', 'war', 'waged', 'said', 'really', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'movie', 'was', 'bad', 'No', 'cast', ""n't"", 'full', 'DeNiros', 'Romero', 'started', 'using', 'CG', 'Land', 'probably', 'biggest', 'complaint', 'look', 'more', 'SyFy', 'channel-ish', 'just', 'flat', 'out', 'sin', 'amongst', 'horror', 'fans', 'right', 'par', 'running', 'zombies', 'social', 'message', ""n't"", 'strong', 'gore', 'minimal', 'twist', 'involving', 'identical', 'twin', 'sister', 'will', 'make', 'roll', 'eyes.Even', ""'ll"", 'take', 'movie', '100', 'Zombielands', '1,000,000', 'Resident', 'Evils', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'Romero', 'lost', 'just', 'think', 'stuck', 'Catch', '22', 'type', 'situation', 'way', 'film', 'industry', 'now', 'genre', 'been', 'ruined']",N/A

What many people may argue though is the quality of his films over the years. Some say his creativity has gone up while many also say his story telling has gone down.Let me start off by saying that the fact that we're seeing Romero try something for the first time in an ACTUAL sequel to one of his other films is an interesting take. By that I of course mean that our lead character Sarge"" Crockett (Alan Van Sprang) was actually a minor character in Romero's previous entry, Diary of the Dead. This is the first time Romero had the ability (or realistically the legal rights) to continue any of his now 6 entries into the ""of the Dead"" series. (Unless you count the extremely brief appearance of Tom Savini being in Dawn and Land as a zombie.)Sarge is leading what is left of his military unit on a path to safety. Where that safety is though they currently have no idea and on top of that they are willing to loot and pillage to get there. What they end up fighting is a secure island. The only problem is the island is already inhabited by 2 Irish families who are at war with each other and have their own ideas on what should be done with the dead. The soldiers that we are following quickly fall into the middle of a struggle between these wo clans and leaves them in a state of array trying to figure out both which side to take and how to really survive.While I'm not sure I enjoy Romero going to CGI for his zombies I will fully give him credit for knowing how to properly use it compared to most of the cgi'd zombie films that are out currently. The kills are gory, the flesh eating is perfect, and as usual Romero has picked a new way for zombies to 'evolve' - though I can't say I like HOW they evolved at the end of the film.While still not as good as Dawn or Day this is Romero's best attempt of his last three. It actually help my attention until the end at which point I had to get a little annoyed. First with how the zombies 'evolve' in this one and second the way the choice the survivors make on where to go and how to survive. If they had just stayed put it would have been easy to clear out and actually have a safe haven to call their own. The chance they take in their decision seems to be one of the more annoying choices a Romero character has made - specially with how much actually loved the build up to that point.",3,A Romero Sequel that crawled to a slow stop,1349049600,"10 1, 2012",2012,2650,"['George', 'A.', 'Romero', 'father', 'modern', 'day', 'zombie', 'one', 'will', 'argue', 'work', 'set', 'genre', 'motion', 'become', 'wonderful', 'world', 'love', 'live', 'today', 'transformed', 'idea', 'voodoo', 'zombie', 'something', 'bit', 'more', 'creative', 'scary', 'something', 'lot', 'closer', 'home', 'What', 'many', 'people', 'may', 'argue', 'though', 'quality', 'films', 'years', 'say', 'creativity', 'gone', 'up', 'many', 'also', 'say', 'story', 'telling', 'gone', 'down.Let', 'start', 'off', 'saying', 'fact', ""'re"", 'seeing', 'Romero', 'try', 'something', 'first', 'time', 'ACTUAL', 'sequel', 'one', 'other', 'films', 'interesting', 'take', 'course', 'mean', 'lead', 'character', 'Sarge', 'Crockett', 'Alan', 'Van', 'Sprang', 'was', 'actually', 'minor', 'character', 'Romero', 'previous', 'entry', 'Diary', 'Dead', 'first', 'time', 'Romero', 'had', 'ability', 'realistically', 'legal', 'rights', 'continue', 'now', '6', 'entries', 'Dead', 'series', 'count', 'extremely', 'brief', 'appearance', 'Tom', 'Savini', 'being', 'Dawn', 'Land', 'zombie', 'Sarge', 'leading', 'what', 'left', 'military', 'unit', 'path', 'safety', 'Where', 'safety', 'currently', 'have', 'idea', 'top', 'are', 'willing', 'loot', 'pillage', 'get', 'there', 'What', 'end', 'up', 'fighting', 'secure', 'island', 'only', 'problem', 'island', 'already', 'inhabited', '2', 'Irish', 'families', 'who', 'are', 'war', 'other', 'have', 'own', 'ideas', 'what', 'should', 'be', 'done', 'dead', 'soldiers', 'are', 'following', 'quickly', 'fall', 'middle', 'struggle', 'wo', 'clans', 'state', 'array', 'trying', 'figure', 'out', 'side', 'take', 'how', 'really', 'survive.While', ""'m"", 'not', 'sure', 'enjoy', 'Romero', 'going', 'CGI', 'zombies', 'will', 'fully', 'give', 'credit', 'knowing', 'how', 'properly', 'use', 'compared', 'most', 'cgi', ""'d"", 'zombie', 'films', 'are', 'out', 'currently', 'kills', 'are', 'gory', 'flesh', 'eating', 'perfect', 'usual', 'Romero', 'picked', 'new', 'way', 'zombies', ""'evolve"", 'ca', ""n't"", 'say', 'like', 'HOW', 'evolved', 'end', 'film.While', 'still', 'not', 'as', 'good', 'Dawn', 'Day', 'Romero', 'best', 'attempt', 'last', 'three', 'actually', 'help', 'attention', 'end', 'point', 'had', 'get', 'little', 'annoyed', 'First', 'how', 'zombies', ""'evolve"", 'one', 'second', 'way', 'choice', 'survivors', 'make', 'where', 'go', 'how', 'survive', 'had', 'just', 'stayed', 'put', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'easy', 'clear', 'out', 'actually', 'have', 'safe', 'haven', 'call', 'own', 'chance', 'take', 'decision', 'be', 'one', 'more', 'annoying', 'choices', 'Romero', 'character', 'made', 'specially', 'how', 'much', 'actually', 'loved', 'build', 'up', 'point']",N/A
1342460,A1ZN0CKODSQJTQ,B003EYVXYG,Tasteful Human,"[2, 4]","I wanted SO much to like this. I was so excited to sit down and watch it (even after paying the ridiculous $10 rental fee on Xbox's Zune). I LOVED Dawn and Day of the Dead, liked Land of the Dead and thought Diary of the Dead was...eh...ok. I'm a pretty big Zombie movie fanatic. 2004's Dawn of the Dead Remake by Zack  Snyder is probably at the top of my list, followed very closely by the original Day of the Dead. Shawn of the Dead was fantastic, but in a different way.I'm not sure what George Romero was thinking here. This movie is just disjointed. It wants to be so many different things, thus detracting from any one theme. The story is really weird, kind of awkward. It's a Zombie movie, but almost as an afterthought. It's almost like Romero wanted to write an entirely different movie but felt obligated to stick to the genre he's known for.There's this weird Hatfield vs. The McCoys story weaved into the well known end of the world Zombie stuff, but I just kept asking myself what the point was. It's just not interesting. I would much rather have seen a not so unfamiliar story (a band of survivors holes up somewhere to fend of the undead hordes) with more focus on how the characters feel and communicate in response to the zombies and the fact that the world is ending, not some lame, overly complicated back story that no average person can relate to . This approach worked wonderfully in Snyder's DoTD remake, and even in the original Dawn. I mean I really sympathized with those characters, where as in this film I could have cared less and just wanted the weird ""family feud"" stuff to be over.And please, George, just let Zombies be dumb, mindless eating machines. I know you're really into allegory and zombie evolution but stop over-thinking. Zombies are Zombies. That's what makes them scary and why we love 'em. The horse-riding Zombie was just too much. And the ending gave me a stomach  ache.As far as the production, there are some really disappointing moments. Day of the Dead, which was made 25 years ago looks far more real and gory than this film. I just cannot get used to CG zombie fx. The scene with the zombie heads on the pikes is pathetic. Some of the physical effects look great, but the poorly done shots really take you out of the film. It must have been budgetary. You really get what you pay for. It is shot well, and the music is good. One particular complaint I have (and maybe because I'm a sound designer for TV and Film), is that a lot of the gunshots sound wimpy. Gunshots in films should be loud and jarring, especially during relatively quiet scenes. A lot of the gunshots in this film (and there are a TON) are mixed at conversation volume. WTF?Overall, very disappointing in my opinion. I'll be interested to see what the consensus turns out to be. I gave it 2 stars because it looks good and is well acted.",2,Another Unfortunate Disappointment,1273190400,"05 7, 2010",2010,2860,"['wanted', 'SO', 'much', 'like', 'was', 'so', 'excited', 'sit', 'down', 'watch', 'even', 'paying', 'ridiculous', '10', 'rental', 'fee', 'Xbox', 'Zune', 'LOVED', 'Dawn', 'Day', 'Dead', 'liked', 'Land', 'Dead', 'thought', 'Diary', 'Dead', 'was', 'eh', 'ok', ""'m"", 'pretty', 'big', 'Zombie', 'movie', 'fanatic', '2004', 'Dawn', 'Dead', 'Remake', 'Zack', 'Snyder', 'probably', 'top', 'list', 'followed', 'very', 'closely', 'original', 'Day', 'Dead', 'Shawn', 'Dead', 'was', 'fantastic', 'different', 'way.I', ""'m"", 'not', 'sure', 'what', 'George', 'Romero', 'was', 'thinking', 'here', 'movie', 'just', 'disjointed', 'be', 'so', 'many', 'different', 'things', 'thus', 'detracting', 'one', 'theme', 'story', 'really', 'weird', 'kind', 'awkward', 'Zombie', 'movie', 'almost', 'afterthought', 'almost', 'like', 'Romero', 'wanted', 'write', 'entirely', 'different', 'movie', 'felt', 'obligated', 'stick', 'genre', 'known', 'for.There', 'weird', 'Hatfield', 'vs', 'McCoys', 'story', 'weaved', 'well', 'known', 'end', 'world', 'Zombie', 'stuff', 'just', 'kept', 'asking', 'what', 'point', 'was', 'just', 'not', 'interesting', 'would', 'much', 'rather', 'have', 'seen', 'not', 'so', 'unfamiliar', 'story', 'band', 'survivors', 'holes', 'up', 'somewhere', 'fend', 'undead', 'hordes', 'more', 'focus', 'how', 'characters', 'feel', 'communicate', 'response', 'zombies', 'fact', 'world', 'ending', 'not', 'lame', 'overly', 'complicated', 'back', 'story', 'average', 'person', 'can', 'relate', 'approach', 'worked', 'wonderfully', 'Snyder', 'DoTD', 'remake', 'even', 'original', 'Dawn', 'mean', 'really', 'sympathized', 'characters', 'where', 'as', 'film', 'could', 'have', 'cared', 'less', 'just', 'wanted', 'weird', 'family', 'feud', 'stuff', 'be', 'over.And', 'please', 'George', 'just', 'let', 'Zombies', 'be', 'dumb', 'mindless', 'eating', 'machines', 'know', ""'re"", 'really', 'allegory', 'zombie', 'evolution', 'stop', 'over-thinking', 'Zombies', 'are', 'Zombies', 'what', 'scary', 'why', 'love', 'horse-riding', 'Zombie', 'was', 'just', 'too', 'much', 'ending', 'gave', 'stomach', 'ache.As', 'far', 'production', 'are', 'really', 'disappointing', 'moments', 'Day', 'Dead', 'was', 'made', '25', 'years', 'ago', 'far', 'more', 'real', 'gory', 'film', 'just', 'can', 'not', 'get', 'used', 'CG', 'zombie', 'fx', 'scene', 'zombie', 'heads', 'pikes', 'pathetic', 'physical', 'effects', 'look', 'great', 'poorly', 'done', 'shots', 'really', 'take', 'film', 'must', 'have', 'been', 'budgetary', 'really', 'get', 'what', 'pay', 'shot', 'well', 'music', 'good', 'One', 'particular', 'complaint', 'have', 'maybe', ""'m"", 'sound', 'designer', 'TV', 'Film', 'lot', 'gunshots', 'sound', 'wimpy', 'Gunshots', 'films', 'should', 'be', 'loud', 'jarring', 'especially', 'relatively', 'quiet', 'scenes', 'lot', 'gunshots', 'film', 'are', 'TON', 'are', 'mixed', 'conversation', 'volume', 'WTF', 'Overall', 'very', 'disappointing', 'opinion', ""'ll"", 'be', 'interested', 'see', 'what', 'consensus', 'out', 'be', 'gave', '2', 'stars', 'good', 'well', 'acted']",N/A

However, this island, Plum island, has its issues. The island, located off Delaware is inhabited by two feuding families with Irish accents (go figure). The unlikeable leader of one family wants to shoot zombies in the head, while the other wants to pen them up and wait for Jesus to show the way.

First, there's the Diary of the Dead reference in which we see some people that we could have assumed were soldiers in Diary. We are given a background on this character, have a few stops and see a few people drop like rocks, and then figure their group at no more than five. Then the focus switches to a small island with two families on it: each familiy is different in their approach, with one monarch in one family calling for ""putting the dead to sleep"" and the other ""allowing the dead to survive to see if there is a cure."" The first doesn't have a nice go, ends up doing some oddities, and becomes the lynchpin in this Romero movie.In Survival of the Dead, there were some things I really took to and some things I didn't. One of the things I really had a problem with was the progession of the zombies; we've seen the zombies throughout the years but, in six days, a zombie is shown with the ability to start and to put a car in forward and reverse. Others do lesser actions, but one zombie actually does something I really don't know if I can see a zombie doing. At the same time, this movie had more of a Land of the Dead feel when it came to budget, knocking Diary of the Dead over the skull when it came to effects. True, the thing had zombies simply pop upquite a bit and take out people when I was thinking, ""and how did that happen.""But those things are crafty - gotta give the dead that.The people themselvves; some were good and some were not so good. i liked something the people saw: the zombies and the water - a lot of books have been focusing on that so they should meet that as well. The reaction to it - that left a lot to be desired. Still, there were some kind of funny people in the ranks. i liked the army-turned-rogue unit and some of the bickering we see coming from their side of the fence. True, i did not like other people and, sometimes, it was a thing revolving around the way they presented themselves.Basically, some were just baddies in the acting gig.There were other things as well; some of the people ran across are simply there to get the storyline going but have no real point, some things happen that shouldn't happen, and s on. BUT this is not some Oscar platform - though I wish horror could be - it is horror. You have to judge it on different places and especially if it has Night, Dawn, Day, Land, Diary, and Survival going in the Dead selection.Fans - great stuff. Newer people - average stuff. If you are looking you might be looking to buy and I thought that worked. Personally i liked it - I liked it enough to round it up to a 4. Others would disagree so watch some clips and judge for yourself. ALSO, the ultimate dis selection has one extra disc with everything on it. The extras from the regular are the first discs stuff, and you get a little more for buying the second disc.

1342470,A1ZGHFGVUF9SR9,B003EYVXYG,William Amazzini,"[2, 6]","I have read so many reviews of this latest Dead Head movie by George A Romero that I approached it as I always have with Romero's visions, keep an open mind and approach it within the mythos of his concept.  Doing this, I think that 'SURVIVAL OF THE DEAD' is Romero at his most poignant and this latest film is his best since the first two of the Zombie cycle. His emergence in the past two decades as a first rate filmmaker and photographer is evident in this films haunting images.  There is not one moment in Zach Snyder's unnecessary remake of 'DAWN OF THE DEAD' that chilled me to the bone and yet the vision in this film of the living dead girl riding her horse through the forest did just that to me in less than a minute. The poignancy begins to arise as the squad comes across redneck vigilantes at a camp site.  Our main character played by Alan Van Spring starts hearing grunting noises and comes upon the heads of zombies impaled on poles within their camp.  The heads still alive glaring and emoting sounds. Van Spring, disgusted by it all, starts firing at the heads and commences firing on the rednecks as Romero, dare I write it, has us feeling sympathy for our zombies.  This feeling persists throughout the film causing the viewers emotions to start bouncing around like a ball bearing. The scene of the character of Muldoon sitting down to have dinner with his captured female soldier as his living dead wife is chained in the kitchen going through her motions and eventually coming into extreme closeup with a look of death from beyond the grave also chilled me as none of the other countless remakes and spinoffs could ever do. The most poignant scene is the one where the two twin sisters, one living and one zombie confront each other , the living reaches out to stroke the dead's face and the suddenness of the attack on the wrist as the zombie cannot control the urge for warm flesh, showing pure motorized instinct at its most chilling, the living sister gasping in both surprise and knowledge that she is already the living dead. These scenes speak volumes as to how George A Romero is the quintessential filmmaker of the Zombie genre , breaking all odds to get his vision on screen. Even the bigger budget of 'LAND OF THE DEAD' released by Universal Pictures does not have the power of these lower budget sequences contained in this excellent horror film. Romero has always been a lone wolf when it comes to bringing his visions to the screen wishing he could do it all on his own rather than having over 40 people on the set trying to keep up with him. Watch the interview included called 'TIME WITH GEORGE' and you'll see what I mean.  No one can touch him and they never should.  Romero leaves us with a new idea at the climax, having the living dead exist off animals as an alternative food supply.  George, I can hardly wait for the next one.",5,Romero's Zombies Come Full Circle,1283299200,"09 1, 2010",2010,2875,"['have', 'read', 'so', 'many', 'reviews', 'latest', 'Dead', 'Head', 'movie', 'George', 'A', 'Romero', 'approached', 'always', 'have', 'Romero', 'visions', 'keep', 'open', 'mind', 'approach', 'mythos', 'concept', 'Doing', 'think', ""'SURVIVAL"", 'THE', 'DEAD', 'Romero', 'most', 'poignant', 'latest', 'film', 'best', 'first', 'two', 'Zombie', 'cycle', 'emergence', 'past', 'two', 'decades', 'first', 'rate', 'filmmaker', 'photographer', 'evident', 'films', 'haunting', 'images', 'not', 'one', 'moment', 'Zach', 'Snyder', 'unnecessary', 'remake', ""'DAWN"", 'THE', 'DEAD', 'chilled', 'bone', 'yet', 'vision', 'film', 'living', 'dead', 'girl', 'riding', 'horse', 'forest', 'did', 'just', 'less', 'minute', 'poignancy', 'arise', 'squad', 'redneck', 'vigilantes', 'camp', 'site', 'main', 'character', 'played', 'Alan', 'Van', 'Spring', 'hearing', 'grunting', 'noises', 'heads', 'zombies', 'impaled', 'poles', 'camp', 'heads', 'still', 'alive', 'glaring', 'emoting', 'sounds', 'Van', 'Spring', 'disgusted', 'firing', 'heads', 'commences', 'firing', 'rednecks', 'Romero', 'dare', 'write', 'feeling', 'sympathy', 'zombies', 'feeling', 'film', 'causing', 'viewers', 'emotions', 'start', 'bouncing', 'ball', 'bearing', 'scene', 'character', 'Muldoon', 'sitting', 'down', 'have', 'dinner', 'captured', 'female', 'soldier', 'living', 'dead', 'wife', 'chained', 'kitchen', 'going', 'motions', 'eventually', 'coming', 'extreme', 'closeup', 'look', 'death', 'grave', 'also', 'chilled', 'none', 'other', 'countless', 'remakes', 'spinoffs', 'could', 'ever', 'do', 'most', 'poignant', 'scene', 'one', 'where', 'two', 'twin', 'sisters', 'one', 'living', 'one', 'zombie', 'confront', 'other', 'living', 'out', 'stroke', 'dead', 'face', 'suddenness', 'attack', 'wrist', 'zombie', 'can', 'not', 'control', 'urge', 'warm', 'flesh', 'showing', 'pure', 'motorized', 'instinct', 'most', 'chilling', 'living', 'sister', 'gasping', 'surprise', 'knowledge', 'already', 'living', 'dead', 'scenes', 'speak', 'volumes', 'how', 'George', 'A', 'Romero', 'quintessential', 'filmmaker', 'Zombie', 'genre', 'breaking', 'odds', 'get', 'vision', 'screen', 'Even', 'bigger', 'budget', ""'LAND"", 'THE', 'DEAD', 'released', 'Universal', 'Pictures', 'not', 'have', 'power', 'lower', 'budget', 'sequences', 'contained', 'excellent', 'horror', 'film', 'Romero', 'always', 'been', 'lone', 'wolf', 'when', 'bringing', 'visions', 'screen', 'wishing', 'could', 'do', 'own', 'rather', 'having', '40', 'people', 'set', 'trying', 'keep', 'up', 'Watch', 'interview', 'included', 'called', ""'TIME"", 'WITH', 'GEORGE', ""'ll"", 'see', 'what', 'mean', 'one', 'can', 'touch', 'never', 'should', 'Romero', 'new', 'idea', 'climax', 'having', 'living', 'dead', 'exist', 'off', 'animals', 'alternative', 'food', 'supply', 'George', 'can', 'hardly', 'wait', 'next', 'one']",N/A

If this scenario were to happen for real you can bet I would not be wasting ammo, worrying about worthless money and shooting people I come across in the woods for no reason (i.e. the rednecks they encounter.) I cannot believe how stupid and naive people in this film are about the zombies. They don't even pick up their dead commrades weapons or gear which would be critical in such a situation. The classic fued scenario would have made a good subplot in a better script, but here it is just plain silly. I imagine Romero is trying to build up to Evolution of the Dead or something like that based on the last several films, but he needs a big budget like he had for Land of the Dead to pull it off.
