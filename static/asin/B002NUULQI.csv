A sequel to story #7, ""Love Takes Wing"", it is right on to bring a satisfying conclusion to the series based on the books of Janette Oke.This 88 minutes brings Dr. Belinda Owens (Sarah Jones), now grown and married to Lee into several situations relating to a doctor's patients and their health concerns. At the same time, a friend from medical school, Dr. Annie Nelson, (two female doctors is unusual for the time period), arrives pregnant and stays with Belinda and Lee till the baby is due.  Belinda has her own emotional issues to deal with as a result.Lee is well played by Jordan Bridges, although looking a bit young to have the adopted daughter, Lillian (Courtney Halverson).  Lil finds her own issues of becoming an adult and finding love.  Also arriving on the scene is Annie's mother-in-law, midwife, and an outspoken lady, Mary (not other than Patty Duke, now 60-something but yet has what it takes to add to any movie.) Too many doctors for one child birth?  OK, it's a Janette Oke story, so we all know it will end deliciously heartwarming and acceptable.  But not till we have some heroics, suspense, and fist-o-cuffs.  It can't all be sweet out west.There is the expected religious aspect to the families that is a thread throughout the book series as well as the movie series.  Faith is a motivating factor for many of the main characters in this story, but not preachy.Honestly, a film cannot replace all that is written into a book, just part.  On the other hand, a movie CAN provide aspects to a story that can only be imagined in book pages.DVD has English and Spanish Subtitles & captioning for the hearing impaired, or for those like us who like to catch all the names correctly. No other extras included.Now, LOVE COMES SOFTLY, is complete as a book series AND a DVD series.  Both are recommended. Both are worthy of 5 stars and a purchase for viewing or reading.
