The movie is entertaining because of the venue and supporting cast.  Debra Paget is lovely in this film, even though she was not an outstanding actress.Yet, there is a certain chemistry between her and Louis Jourdan that appeals to the viewer.  The plot is almost predictable, andthe ending something Hollywood liked to do often in deeply romantic films.",3,Entertaining South Seas Island Film,1399075200,"05 3, 2014",2014,456,"['not', 'great', 'film', 'acting', 'Jeff', 'Chandler', 'Louis', 'Jourdan', 'enjoyable', 'watch', 'movie', 'entertaining', 'venue', 'supporting', 'cast', 'Debra', 'Paget', 'lovely', 'film', 'even', 'was', 'not', 'outstanding', 'actress.Yet', 'certain', 'chemistry', 'Louis', 'Jourdan', 'appeals', 'viewer', 'plot', 'almost', 'predictable', 'andthe', 'ending', 'something', 'Hollywood', 'liked', 'do', 'often', 'deeply', 'romantic', 'films']",Bird of Paradise (1951)

Haven't they got it yet?  Anyone with half a brain would know that putting such sub-standard product on the market is a NO BRAINER!  Don't those in charge of Home Entertainment at Fox ever read the customer reviews about their dreadful transfers of most of their releases, on Amazon.  They all must be too busy doing self-colonoscopies!The brightness and contrast needed to be adjusted when the film was transferred to digital, or perhaps it came direct from a VHS copy.  It certainly wasn't from a TV print, because no television station in the world would accept such inferior product for telecast!  I know this for a fact, as I have been in the TV industry for 45 years.The majority of scenes were so dark that you could make out only the whites of their eyes, and their teeth when they smiled.  When there was a bright background, as was the case with the sky, the characters were in silhouette with no distinctive features.  Only a few scenes were acceptable, and those were the ones filmed in bright sunlight.  Many of the interior scenes looked like they were lit by a single candle.NOT GOOD ENOUGH FOX!  Get your damn act together, otherwise charge less than $5 per copy.  Most of their products up until now have been a waste of money, and I for one, after having (unfortunately) laid out several hundreds of dollars on many of their releases (hoping that I might hit the jackpot with an excellent and viewable transfer), I will not be recommending any of their product to others, and most certainly won't waste any more money in the future on their sub-standard, lack lustre product !!!
