We put it in the other night and my little girl moved the entire time the DVD was playing.  It's a little corny (for adults), but I think that is what makes it so good for kids!  The dance section is definitely the best (toward the end), but the whole DVD is definitely worth it.

922113,A2814P4P36QHPE,B000A5N4JO,Virginia,"[0, 4]","Received the video this morning today...popped it in the DVD and observed my son as it played. My 2.5 year old son watched it for about 1.5 mins and he got out of his chair and threw himself on the floor and threw a tantrum wanting me to take it out. My little son goes to a Little Gym once a week, and has been participating in over 20 sessions that does similar stuff as the Move N Groove video, he has never once thrown a fit at the Little Gym. But for some reason, he didn't respond to the Move N Groove video.  He loves watching Brainy Baby DVD's and Baby Rodenburg and has never cried about them being on, but for some reason he did not like Move N Groove. I am keeping my fingers crossed that tomorrow he will give it another try. Peace.
