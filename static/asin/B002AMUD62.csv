Mah ""Bill""","[0, 0]","H2O: Season 1, Volume 1 was a 3-disc DVD-R set that contained the first half (just 13 episodes) of the Australian TV series H2O: Just Add Water. This set was released in 2009 from Nickelodeon, via Amazon's CreateSpace manufacture-on-demand program. The show is enjoyable for children and teenagers to watch. The only unfortunate thing was that no further follow-up DVD sets were made to finish off Season 1 or any for Seasons 2 and 3. This was the only DVD release for North America for this TV series at that point.In 2012, New Video would release H2O: Just Add Water - The Complete Series DVD boxed set of all 3 seasons for North America, as well as offering all 3 Seasons as Individual sets.

I've always liked mermaids, so what I saw of this show was really cute and enjoyable, with an overall fun storyline.It's a shame that the whole series hasn't been released to America, surely it can't be that hard to create season or series sets of this show?

I'm obsessed with Mermaids and this show completely feeds my desire of returning to an underwater world. The three main characters are gorgeous young ladies, one more pretty than the next who make the show incredibly entertaining from start to finish. Of course you'll love them in their Mer form as well! Being an American it is so much fun to hear everyone's Australian accents on the show. Everything from the sets to the soundtrack is pure fun.

1258602,AV5H2I9CHN8YI,B002AMUD62,N. Gregg,"[1, 2]","Fairly cute TV show for tweens complete with the usual G-rated teen issues (including the snotty popular rich girl who thinks way too much of herself, and the rich bully a-hole guy), but for 3 girls there is an additional BIG problem - they have mysteriously become mermaids.  Just a tiny amount of water on them turns them into mermaids in seconds.  Naturally this is not a secret they want to share for fear of becoming scientific lab rats or worse.The premise is interesting and entertaining, and there is nice footage underwater and beach footage.  The writing isn't too bad, (these kids seem to have an AMAZING amount of unsupervised free time)  -- the downside is that the acting leaves a lot to be desired (especially by Phoebe Tonkin ""Cleo"",  and Claire Holt ""Emma"")Since I have just completed watching all the episodes pretty much back to back through end of season 3 (thanks to Amazon Prime), I can tell you that the acting does get a bit better -- and the show manages to keep being entertaining. You don't have to be a tween/teen to enjoy this show - I'm in my early 50's and enjoyed them.BONUS PREVIEW REVIEW for season 2 - the acting gets better and the girls get some serious mermaid competition that ends in a showdown you'll enjoy.",3,3 and a half stars ... but it's entertaining,1345334400,"08 19, 2012",2012,1248,"['Fairly', 'cute', 'TV', 'show', 'tweens', 'complete', 'usual', 'G-rated', 'teen', 'issues', 'including', 'snotty', 'popular', 'rich', 'girl', 'who', 'way', 'too', 'much', 'herself', 'rich', 'bully', 'a-hole', 'guy', '3', 'girls', 'additional', 'BIG', 'problem', 'have', 'mysteriously', 'become', 'mermaids', 'Just', 'tiny', 'amount', 'water', 'mermaids', 'seconds', 'Naturally', 'not', 'secret', 'want', 'share', 'fear', 'becoming', 'scientific', 'lab', 'rats', 'worse.The', 'premise', 'interesting', 'entertaining', 'nice', 'footage', 'underwater', 'beach', 'footage', 'writing', ""n't"", 'too', 'bad', 'kids', 'seem', 'have', 'AMAZING', 'amount', 'unsupervised', 'free', 'time', 'downside', 'acting', 'lot', 'be', 'desired', 'especially', 'Phoebe', 'Tonkin', 'Cleo', 'Claire', 'Holt', 'Emma', 'have', 'just', 'completed', 'watching', 'episodes', 'pretty', 'much', 'back', 'back', 'end', 'season', '3', 'thanks', 'Amazon', 'Prime', 'can', 'tell', 'acting', 'get', 'bit', 'better', 'show', 'keep', 'being', 'entertaining', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'be', 'tween/teen', 'enjoy', 'show', ""'m"", 'early', '50', 'enjoyed', 'them.BONUS', 'PREVIEW', 'REVIEW', 'season', '2', 'acting', 'better', 'girls', 'get', 'serious', 'mermaid', 'competition', 'showdown', ""'ll"", 'enjoy']",H20 Season 1 Volume 1
