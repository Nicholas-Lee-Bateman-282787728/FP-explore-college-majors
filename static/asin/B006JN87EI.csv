1516478,AP83SRXMF6X39,B006JN87EI,DENISSE,"[0, 0]","I had to agree with what Mister Rogers stood for in his lifetime. He understood that life for children was going to get harder. Television, video games, the internet. Everything now is buy this and that, sex humor and bad language. I like many grew up with Mister Rogers. Just today my sis and I were saying that we wish we lived in more in times when things were calm. We just lived a few years in the 80s. Then I said that SADLY our children who aren't born yet won't get that time. Or any of that time. Mister Rogers wanted to keep kids safe from all that's going on in the world now. This documentary lets us know how he fought for kids education. It was like he was trying to shelter all the children from harm. Which now I see is the real world. We see interviews from the people that he touched in a special way. He loved everyone and everyone loved him. Isn't that the greatest commandment? Jesus said, ""Love one another as I have loved you."" RIP Mister Rogers. My children will also grow up watching your show. :)",5,Fantastic!!,1380931200,"10 5, 2013",2013,1022,"['had', 'agree', 'what', 'Mister', 'Rogers', 'stood', 'lifetime', 'understood', 'life', 'children', 'was', 'going', 'get', 'harder', 'Television', 'video', 'games', 'internet', 'Everything', 'now', 'buy', 'sex', 'humor', 'bad', 'language', 'like', 'many', 'grew', 'up', 'Mister', 'Rogers', 'Just', 'today', 'sis', 'were', 'saying', 'wish', 'lived', 'more', 'times', 'when', 'things', 'were', 'calm', 'just', 'lived', 'few', 'years', '80s', 'Then', 'said', 'SADLY', 'children', 'who', 'are', ""n't"", 'born', 'yet', 'wo', ""n't"", 'get', 'time', 'time', 'Mister', 'Rogers', 'wanted', 'keep', 'kids', 'safe', 'going', 'world', 'now', 'documentary', 'know', 'how', 'fought', 'kids', 'education', 'was', 'was', 'trying', 'shelter', 'children', 'harm', 'now', 'see', 'real', 'world', 'see', 'interviews', 'people', 'touched', 'special', 'way', 'loved', 'everyone', 'everyone', 'loved', ""n't"", 'greatest', 'commandment', 'Jesus', 'said', 'Love', 'one', 'have', 'loved', 'RIP', 'Mister', 'Rogers', 'children', 'will', 'also', 'grow', 'up', 'watching', 'show']",Mister Rogers & Me

1516480,A34GZPHWYPSY2T,B006JN87EI,"E. Hernandez ""Call me Harry""","[10, 10]","MISTER ROGERS AND ME (writ., prod., dir. Ben and Chris Wagner, 2010, 70 minutes) is a wonderful, must-see, can't-miss documentary of Reverend Fred McFeely Rogers, better known as Mr. Rogers. Presented and narrated by Ben Wagner, who was a young neighbor of Mr. Rogers' near the Rogers' ""Crooked House"" on Nantucket, this film not only gives the viewer a healthy dose of Mr. Rogers. It dwells for 70 minutes on the massive, sacred contribution of Mr. Rogers and speaks to several great people who were influenced and taught by him.A chubby boy fled for cover as a mob of bullies chased him, shouting, ""We're going to get you, Fat Freddie!!"" This was the 8-year-old Mr. Rogers, who had an odd kind of upbringing. While his family strove to see the good in people - which was Mr. Rogers' own profound way - they dismissed his anger, his distress at being fat and being bullied, they told him to shrug it off like it was nothing. This may have been the most profound (and sadly negative) lesson in Fred's young life: why hadn't his parents allowed him an outlet, given him some guidance? He sought his entire life to discover why - and to fix it.It would come down to fearlessly acknowledging, accepting and working out kids' feelings.Fred Rogers graduated college with a degree in musical composition - and would return to the seminary later to emerge as an ordained Presbyterian minister. His congregation would be the nation, via television, and in that sense he was a television preacher. He was so much more than that, and I think of him as the founder of public television, which he fought to establish in the early 1960s. Deeply touched by the works of spiritual guru Bo Lozoff, Mr. Rogers sought to enlighten children - and everyone with ears to hear and eyes to see - about that which is beautiful, noble and sacred.This documentary will teach you, guide you and inform you about all that. It will illuminate in a deeply simple way how life can change with the knowledge of just one thing that is beautiful, noble or sacred. Just one. When I first saw Mr. Rogers, a funny thing influenced me and drew me in: his ritual changing from his business attire into a sweater (knitted for him by his mother) and blue sneakers. Not only that, but neatly hanging his jacket and stowing his shiny shoes in the closet. It seems shallow, but that is what grabbed me about him originally.Everyone has memories of him, whether we are ""Mister Rogers kids"" or not. Old as I was, I became a Mister Rogers kid and I can only hope to accomplish a fraction of what he taught. Get this beautiful and spiritually profound documentary, a selfless journey by the Wagner brothers to find out what Mr. Rogers' real-life neighbors thought about him, what they shared with him. You will discover a man who ultimately has had more impact and influence than any other religious leader on earth.And never once did he preach, or try to sell us anything, because, you see, Mr. Rogers liked everyone ... just they way they are.",5,Buddha of the 20th Century and Beyond,1335830400,"05 1, 2012",2012,2997,"['MISTER', 'ROGERS', 'AND', 'ME', 'writ.', 'prod.', 'dir', 'Ben', 'Chris', 'Wagner', '2010', '70', 'minutes', 'wonderful', 'must-see', ""can't-miss"", 'documentary', 'Reverend', 'Fred', 'McFeely', 'Rogers', 'better', 'known', 'Mr.', 'Rogers', 'Presented', 'narrated', 'Ben', 'Wagner', 'who', 'was', 'young', 'neighbor', 'Mr.', 'Rogers', 'Rogers', 'Crooked', 'House', 'Nantucket', 'film', 'not', 'only', 'viewer', 'healthy', 'dose', 'Mr.', 'Rogers', '70', 'minutes', 'massive', 'sacred', 'contribution', 'Mr.', 'Rogers', 'several', 'great', 'people', 'who', 'were', 'influenced', 'taught', 'him.A', 'chubby', 'boy', 'fled', 'cover', 'mob', 'bullies', 'chased', 'shouting', ""'re"", 'going', 'get', 'Fat', 'Freddie', 'was', '8-year-old', 'Mr.', 'Rogers', 'who', 'had', 'odd', 'kind', 'upbringing', 'family', 'strove', 'see', 'good', 'people', 'was', 'Mr.', 'Rogers', 'own', 'profound', 'way', 'dismissed', 'anger', 'distress', 'being', 'fat', 'being', 'bullied', 'told', 'shrug', 'off', 'was', 'nothing', 'may', 'have', 'been', 'most', 'profound', 'sadly', 'negative', 'lesson', 'Fred', 'young', 'life', 'why', 'had', ""n't"", 'parents', 'allowed', 'outlet', 'given', 'guidance', 'sought', 'entire', 'life', 'discover', 'why', 'fix', 'it.It', 'would', 'come', 'down', 'fearlessly', 'acknowledging', 'accepting', 'working', 'out', 'kids', 'feelings.Fred', 'Rogers', 'graduated', 'college', 'degree', 'musical', 'composition', 'would', 'return', 'seminary', 'later', 'emerge', 'ordained', 'Presbyterian', 'minister', 'congregation', 'would', 'be', 'nation', 'television', 'sense', 'was', 'television', 'preacher', 'was', 'so', 'much', 'more', 'think', 'founder', 'public', 'television', 'fought', 'establish', 'early', '1960s', 'Deeply', 'touched', 'works', 'spiritual', 'guru', 'Bo', 'Lozoff', 'Mr.', 'Rogers', 'sought', 'enlighten', 'children', 'everyone', 'ears', 'hear', 'eyes', 'see', 'beautiful', 'noble', 'sacred.This', 'documentary', 'will', 'teach', 'guide', 'inform', 'will', 'illuminate', 'deeply', 'simple', 'way', 'how', 'life', 'can', 'change', 'knowledge', 'just', 'one', 'thing', 'beautiful', 'noble', 'sacred', 'Just', 'one', 'When', 'first', 'saw', 'Mr.', 'Rogers', 'funny', 'thing', 'influenced', 'drew', 'ritual', 'changing', 'business', 'attire', 'sweater', 'knitted', 'mother', 'blue', 'sneakers', 'Not', 'only', 'neatly', 'hanging', 'jacket', 'stowing', 'shiny', 'shoes', 'closet', 'shallow', 'what', 'grabbed', 'memories', 'are', 'Mister', 'Rogers', 'kids', 'not', 'was', 'became', 'Mister', 'Rogers', 'kid', 'can', 'only', 'hope', 'accomplish', 'fraction', 'what', 'taught', 'Get', 'beautiful', 'spiritually', 'profound', 'documentary', 'selfless', 'journey', 'Wagner', 'brothers', 'find', 'out', 'what', 'Mr.', 'Rogers', 'real-life', 'neighbors', 'thought', 'what', 'shared', 'will', 'discover', 'man', 'who', 'ultimately', 'had', 'more', 'impact', 'influence', 'other', 'religious', 'leader', 'earth.And', 'never', 'once', 'did', 'preach', 'try', 'sell', 'anything', 'see', 'Mr.', 'Rogers', 'liked', 'everyone', 'just', 'way', 'are']",Mister Rogers & Me

Ramm ""Steve Ramm &#34;Anything Phon...","[34, 36]","A must see for those raised on the PBS show or any parent whose children watch television.Wouldn't ""we"" all like to live in Mister Rogers real neighborhood, especially nearly next door? (I say ""we"" because the long-running PBS show ` ""Mister Rogers' Neighborhood"" - came a bit after my own childhood. I grew up on ""Ding Dong School"" and ""Romper Room"".) Well MTV producer Ben Wagner - along with his cameraman brother, Chris, actually did live next to Fred Rogers in Nantucket, RI, when he was growing up. Rogers died in 2003 and the filmmaker Wagner brothers decided to produce a documentary tribute to Rogers and the ideals he set out to share with his PBS audience through his PBS show.Through archival photos - gathered from the Rogers family - and interviews with celebrities - including another Nantucket neighbor, the late Tim Russert (NBC's ""meet The Press), NPRs original ""All Things Considered"" host, Susan Stamberg,, and Nick News producer Linda Ellerbee, the Wagners weave a loving tribute to this ""gentle"" man who never had an unkind word for anyone.The fact that placing a child in front of a TV set when MRN was on was a ""safe place to be"" is reiterated throughout the 70-minute film. Unlike ""Sesame Street"" and ""Barney"", Rogers never used his name or show to sell merchandise to children. There are facts revealed in Ben Wagner's narration that will interest parents. The percent of one-year old children who have a TV in their room was just one that astounded me.If I was left with one question after watching the film, it was that the Wagners interviewed nearly everyone that was ""connected"" to Rogers and his career but not his family. We learn, briefly, that he had two sons but - aside from one photo - they are never mentioned again, nor interviewed.The DVD has bonus features including a commentary with the two Wagners (this in addition to the fact that Ben Wagner narrates the film. Bonus interviews with Russert and Stamberg are here as well plus a Q&A; with David Newell (Mr. McFeely) and Angela Santomero (creator of ""Blue's Clue's"" and ""Daniel Tiger's Neighborhood"")I would certainly recommend this film to anyone who grew up watching MRN or any current parent of young children who watch a lot of television.I hope you found this review both informative and helpful.Steve Ramm""Anything Phonographic""",5,A must see for those raised on the PBS show or any parent whose children watch television.,1331424000,"03 11, 2012",2012,2328,"['must', 'see', 'raised', 'PBS', 'show', 'parent', 'children', 'watch', 'television.Would', ""n't"", 'live', 'Mister', 'Rogers', 'real', 'neighborhood', 'especially', 'nearly', 'next', 'door', 'say', 'long-running', 'PBS', 'show', 'Mister', 'Rogers', 'Neighborhood', 'came', 'bit', 'own', 'childhood', 'grew', 'up', 'Ding', 'Dong', 'School', 'Romper', 'Room', 'Well', 'MTV', 'producer', 'Ben', 'Wagner', 'cameraman', 'brother', 'Chris', 'actually', 'did', 'live', 'next', 'Fred', 'Rogers', 'Nantucket', 'RI', 'when', 'was', 'growing', 'up', 'Rogers', 'died', '2003', 'filmmaker', 'Wagner', 'brothers', 'decided', 'produce', 'documentary', 'tribute', 'Rogers', 'ideals', 'set', 'out', 'share', 'PBS', 'audience', 'PBS', 'show.Through', 'archival', 'photos', 'gathered', 'Rogers', 'family', 'interviews', 'celebrities', 'including', 'Nantucket', 'neighbor', 'late', 'Tim', 'Russert', 'NBC', 'meet', 'Press', 'NPRs', 'original', 'Things', 'Considered', 'host', 'Susan', 'Stamberg', 'Nick', 'News', 'producer', 'Linda', 'Ellerbee', 'Wagners', 'weave', 'loving', 'tribute', 'gentle', 'man', 'who', 'never', 'had', 'unkind', 'word', 'anyone.The', 'fact', 'placing', 'child', 'front', 'TV', 'set', 'when', 'MRN', 'was', 'was', 'safe', 'place', 'be', 'reiterated', '70-minute', 'film', 'Sesame', 'Street', 'Barney', 'Rogers', 'never', 'used', 'name', 'show', 'sell', 'merchandise', 'children', 'are', 'facts', 'revealed', 'Ben', 'Wagner', 'narration', 'will', 'interest', 'parents', 'percent', 'one-year', 'old', 'children', 'who', 'have', 'TV', 'room', 'was', 'just', 'one', 'astounded', 'me.If', 'was', 'left', 'one', 'question', 'watching', 'film', 'was', 'Wagners', 'interviewed', 'nearly', 'everyone', 'was', 'connected', 'Rogers', 'career', 'not', 'family', 'learn', 'briefly', 'had', 'two', 'sons', 'aside', 'one', 'photo', 'are', 'never', 'mentioned', 'again', 'interviewed.The', 'DVD', 'bonus', 'features', 'including', 'commentary', 'two', 'Wagners', 'addition', 'fact', 'Ben', 'Wagner', 'film', 'Bonus', 'interviews', 'Russert', 'Stamberg', 'are', 'here', 'as', 'well', 'Q', 'A', 'David', 'Newell', 'Mr.', 'McFeely', 'Angela', 'Santomero', 'creator', 'Blue', 'Clue', 'Daniel', 'Tiger', 'Neighborhood', 'would', 'certainly', 'recommend', 'film', 'anyone', 'who', 'grew', 'up', 'watching', 'MRN', 'current', 'parent', 'young', 'children', 'who', 'watch', 'lot', 'television.I', 'hope', 'found', 'review', 'informative', 'helpful.Steve', 'Ramm', 'Anything', 'Phonographic']",Mister Rogers & Me
