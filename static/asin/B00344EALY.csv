When I started the movie I immediately had flashbacks to Vertical Limit and Chris O'Donnell cutting the rope.  If Vertical Limit had a horror movie woodsy baby with Saw; this would be it.  Know what it is before you watch it - a Saw-like movie.  If you are expecting something grand out of this movie and original you are not going to find it.  It kept me entertained for the time I expected and I took it for what it was.  The one flaw that I did find as far as a continuation flas was the talk of a boat house when there was not one.  I fault the writers for that.,4,If Vertical Limit met Saw in the woods,1354579200,"12 4, 2012",2012,690,"['When', 'choose', 'movies', 'watch', 'free', 'streaming', 'do', ""n't"", 'set', 'expectations', 'high', 'so', 'tend', 'not', 'get', 'too', 'disappointed', 'When', 'started', 'movie', 'immediately', 'had', 'flashbacks', 'Vertical', 'Limit', 'Chris', ""O'Donnell"", 'cutting', 'rope', 'Vertical', 'Limit', 'had', 'horror', 'movie', 'woodsy', 'baby', 'Saw', 'would', 'be', 'Know', 'what', 'watch', 'Saw-like', 'movie', 'are', 'expecting', 'something', 'grand', 'movie', 'original', 'are', 'not', 'going', 'find', 'kept', 'entertained', 'time', 'expected', 'took', 'what', 'was', 'one', 'flaw', 'did', 'find', 'as', 'far', 'continuation', 'flas', 'was', 'talk', 'boat', 'house', 'when', 'was', 'not', 'one', 'fault', 'writers']",N/A

In this case it is the basic plot idea that recommends this film.  Unfortunately, the script and its execution (especially the dialogue) leaves too much to be desired.  Having the germ of a good idea isn't enough, unfortunately.  And to give you an idea of where this director is coming from: in the deleted scene he actually suggests it was foolish to film the scene during daylight because nothing scary happens in films in daylight.  REALLY?  Just last night I watched Hitchcock's The Birds, so I'll mention that.  Otherwise I'd be left with many thousands of other examples to draw upon of what a real director can do when confronted with the idea of making something scary happen during daylight.

1320682,A18G7GG53G2X8A,B00344EALY,Chris Pandolfi,"[4, 5]","It begins with a vanload of college kids driving down a lone road in the middle of the woods. They all begin that way, don't they? But wait, it gets even better. They arrive at a summer lake house, which just happens to be located at least fifty miles from the nearest police or fire station, and they immediately find all the booze. After a night of drinking and partying and more drinking, most of them go off and have sex. The only exception is the one guy whose lack of experience in the girlfriend department is in direct proportion to his extra weight. He's left to play video games all by himself, the poor guy. What's worse, he has to watch as two of his friends get hot and heavy directly outside his window.Anyway, at around three in the morning, an unseen madman descends on the house and forces the kids to participate in a social experiment. The hypothesis: One of them is capable of killing everyone else in order to survive. If more than one is left alive by 6:00 am, the madman makes it clear that everyone will die.The college kids aren't allowed to leave the house, and anyone that tries will either be killed on the spot or fall victim to a booby trap. They all must take part in this. As the three hours pass, paranoia, distrust, and resentment grow amongst the college kids. Old wounds open. Feelings, both good and bad (mostly bad), arise. Some think they have made alliances, but in reality, they all have to fend for themselves. Why are they being put through this? What lesson is this madman trying to teach? Why is he teaching it?I thought the idea of subjecting people to dangerous mind games had been exhausted with the ""Saw"" films, but I guess I was wrong. In all likelihood, ""Kill Theory"" will appease many horror audiences, seeing as it gives them everything they want. Young victims. Topless girls. Bad dialogue. A lot of swearing. A plot that pretends to make a point but is really just a vehicle for gory death scenes. If this is your cup of tea, fine, but I seriously doubt there's anything in this movie you can't get from other slashers. I take that back; this movie does not supply the madman with a mask. For the most part, he remains off screen and lets the college kids do most of the dirty work.Anyone can make a case for how movies like this are ugly, cruel, and mindless, but the real problem here is that ""Kill Theory"" just isn't trying very hard. There isn't much originality in its story, its characters, or its structure, inspired by every slasher film made between 1980 and now, many of which were rehashes from the word go. There's not a single likeable or interesting person amongst the eight college kids - not even Freddy, the overweight guy (Daniel Franzese), introduced as the pathetic nice guy but in due time devolves into the wigged out lunatic that cries a lot. From the filmmaker's point of view, he's just a figure of fun, made to be laughed at more than sympathized with. I can't say I appreciate that. Even with the occasional corny joke, this really isn't a funny film.What saves ""Kill Theory"" from utter pointlessness is its development of the killer, who isn't really seen but is sometimes heard. He's played by Kevin Gage as a cross between Jigsaw, Ghost Face, and the late Don LaFontaine, otherwise known as the guy who used to narrate all the movie trailers. Just wait until you hear him deliver the line, ""Deep down, we're all killers."" I leave it to you to discover what drives his character. I will say that it was revealed rather cleverly, in a way that proves horror movie plot twists still have their place.But on the whole, this is a clich&eacute;, tiresome film, made worse by a story we can't actively engage in. How can we when the whole thing is so preposterous? More to the point, how can we when there isn't a character we can actually invest in? Franzese, Teddy Dunn, Ryanne Duzich, Patrick Fleuger, Steffi Wickens, Taryn Manning, Theo Rossi, and Agnes Bruckner show spirit in trying to make something of the screenplay, but it doesn't count for much since director Chris Moore and writer Kelly C. Palmer had to make something of the roles first. They perform as best they can, which is admirable but also futile; their characters are required to do no more or less than die on cue, and that hardly requires any range.I've admitted numerous times that I've grown tired of the slasher genre, so I guess my not liking ""Kill Theory"" was inevitable. If you're not like me, however, then chances are you will enjoy it. As I said, it gives you everything you could possibly want. This definitely includes the horrifying discovery that not only are cell phones useless in the woods, but also that the phone line in the house has been severed. Funny - I would have thought the filmmakers would go one step further and have the whole thing take place in the middle of a rainstorm. If you're going to rely on clich&eacute;s, you might as well go all the way.",3,Is There Evidence to Support it?,1271548800,"04 18, 2010",2010,4931,"['vanload', 'college', 'kids', 'driving', 'down', 'lone', 'road', 'middle', 'woods', 'begin', 'way', 'do', ""n't"", 'wait', 'even', 'better', 'arrive', 'summer', 'lake', 'house', 'just', 'be', 'located', 'least', 'fifty', 'miles', 'nearest', 'police', 'fire', 'station', 'immediately', 'find', 'booze', 'night', 'drinking', 'partying', 'more', 'drinking', 'most', 'go', 'off', 'have', 'sex', 'only', 'exception', 'one', 'guy', 'lack', 'experience', 'girlfriend', 'department', 'direct', 'proportion', 'extra', 'weight', 'left', 'play', 'video', 'games', 'poor', 'guy', 'What', 'worse', 'watch', 'two', 'friends', 'get', 'hot', 'heavy', 'directly', 'window.Anyway', 'three', 'morning', 'unseen', 'madman', 'house', 'kids', 'participate', 'social', 'experiment', 'hypothesis', 'One', 'capable', 'killing', 'everyone', 'else', 'order', 'survive', 'more', 'one', 'left', 'alive', '6:00', 'am', 'madman', 'clear', 'everyone', 'will', 'die.The', 'college', 'kids', 'are', ""n't"", 'allowed', 'leave', 'house', 'anyone', 'will', 'either', 'be', 'killed', 'spot', 'fall', 'victim', 'booby', 'trap', 'must', 'take', 'part', 'three', 'hours', 'pass', 'paranoia', 'distrust', 'resentment', 'grow', 'college', 'kids', 'Old', 'open', 'Feelings', 'good', 'bad', 'mostly', 'bad', 'arise', 'think', 'have', 'made', 'alliances', 'reality', 'have', 'fend', 'Why', 'are', 'being', 'put', 'What', 'lesson', 'madman', 'trying', 'teach', 'Why', 'teaching', 'thought', 'idea', 'subjecting', 'people', 'dangerous', 'mind', 'games', 'had', 'been', 'exhausted', 'Saw', 'films', 'guess', 'was', 'wrong', 'likelihood', 'Kill', 'Theory', 'will', 'appease', 'many', 'horror', 'audiences', 'seeing', 'everything', 'want', 'Young', 'victims', 'Topless', 'girls', 'Bad', 'dialogue', 'lot', 'swearing', 'plot', 'make', 'point', 'really', 'just', 'vehicle', 'gory', 'death', 'scenes', 'cup', 'tea', 'fine', 'seriously', 'doubt', 'anything', 'movie', 'ca', ""n't"", 'get', 'other', 'slashers', 'take', 'back', 'movie', 'not', 'supply', 'madman', 'mask', 'most', 'part', 'screen', 'college', 'kids', 'do', 'most', 'dirty', 'work.Anyone', 'can', 'make', 'case', 'how', 'movies', 'are', 'ugly', 'cruel', 'mindless', 'real', 'problem', 'here', 'Kill', 'Theory', 'just', ""n't"", 'trying', 'very', 'hard', ""n't"", 'much', 'originality', 'story', 'characters', 'structure', 'inspired', 'slasher', 'film', 'made', '1980', 'now', 'many', 'were', 'rehashes', 'word', 'go', 'not', 'single', 'likeable', 'interesting', 'person', 'amongst', 'eight', 'college', 'kids', 'not', 'even', 'Freddy', 'overweight', 'guy', 'Daniel', 'Franzese', 'introduced', 'pathetic', 'nice', 'guy', 'due', 'time', 'wigged', 'out', 'lunatic', 'lot', 'filmmaker', 'point', 'view', 'just', 'figure', 'fun', 'made', 'be', 'laughed', 'more', 'sympathized', 'ca', ""n't"", 'say', 'appreciate', 'Even', 'occasional', 'corny', 'joke', 'really', ""n't"", 'funny', 'Kill', 'Theory', 'utter', 'pointlessness', 'development', 'killer', 'who', ""n't"", 'really', 'seen', 'sometimes', 'heard', 'played', 'Kevin', 'Gage', 'cross', 'Jigsaw', 'Ghost', 'Face', 'late', 'Don', 'LaFontaine', 'otherwise', 'known', 'guy', 'who', 'used', 'narrate', 'movie', 'trailers', 'Just', 'wait', 'hear', 'deliver', 'line', 'Deep', 'down', ""'re"", 'killers', 'leave', 'discover', 'what', 'character', 'will', 'say', 'was', 'revealed', 'rather', 'cleverly', 'way', 'horror', 'movie', 'plot', 'twists', 'still', 'have', 'place.But', 'whole', 'clich', 'eacute', 'film', 'made', 'worse', 'story', 'ca', ""n't"", 'actively', 'engage', 'How', 'can', 'when', 'whole', 'thing', 'so', 'preposterous', 'More', 'point', 'how', 'can', 'when', ""n't"", 'character', 'can', 'actually', 'invest', 'Franzese', 'Teddy', 'Dunn', 'Ryanne', 'Duzich', 'Patrick', 'Fleuger', 'Steffi', 'Wickens', 'Taryn', 'Manning', 'Theo', 'Rossi', 'Agnes', 'Bruckner', 'show', 'spirit', 'trying', 'make', 'something', 'screenplay', ""n't"", 'count', 'much', 'director', 'Chris', 'Moore', 'writer', 'Kelly', 'C.', 'Palmer', 'had', 'make', 'something', 'roles', 'first', 'perform', 'can', 'admirable', 'also', 'futile', 'characters', 'are', 'required', 'do', 'more', 'less', 'die', 'cue', 'hardly', 'range.I', ""'ve"", 'admitted', 'numerous', 'times', ""'ve"", 'grown', 'tired', 'slasher', 'genre', 'guess', 'not', 'liking', 'Kill', 'Theory', 'was', 'inevitable', ""'re"", 'not', 'however', 'then', 'chances', 'are', 'will', 'enjoy', 'said', 'everything', 'could', 'possibly', 'want', 'definitely', 'horrifying', 'discovery', 'not', 'only', 'are', 'cell', 'phones', 'useless', 'woods', 'also', 'phone', 'line', 'house', 'been', 'severed', 'Funny', 'would', 'have', 'thought', 'filmmakers', 'would', 'go', 'one', 'step', 'further', 'have', 'whole', 'thing', 'take', 'place', 'middle', 'rainstorm', ""'re"", 'going', 'rely', 'clich', 'eacute', 'might', 'as', 'well', 'go', 'way']",N/A

1320684,A2IY9M330NKBW6,B00344EALY,Eric Sanberg,"[1, 3]","Why there is such a paucity of fresh ideas in the film industry is beyond me. On the technical side we seem to have the best of the best. American films are some of the best shot, edited, scored, etc., etc., etc.,on the planet. But try to come up with an original script and you're in the desert. Maybe they're out there and just can't get funded BECAUSE they're original. It might be like the banking industry. Banks give you an umbrella when it's sunny out.Kill Theory is a good example. I saw the first and (I believe) second ""Saw"" movies. The first was pretty good and the second was more of the same. My guess that trend continued, but it was a successful series so someone tried to figure out how to tweek the original idea and make a movie out of it. Kill Theory takes the original Saw premise and turns it so that the idea isn't just to save yourself by coming clean on some sin you committed, it is to save yourself at the expense of your friends.Here, a group of soon to be college grad friends takes a few days at the summer home of one of the troop to binge on booze and sex. I guess it's the final fling before graduation. It's an idyllic place way off in the country. Soon they are put upon by the bad guy who tells them that if one of them will kill all the others he will save his own butt. If they stick together and not do so, he will kill them all.Things unravel and people die. None of this rings true.Of course they are too far away from any place for their cell phones to work. ( I don't know how many times that's shown up recently) Of course the killer has set up clever little traps for them. Of course he's figured out what they will do before they do it. The writer's thumb prints are all over the script. You can feel the wheels turn as the story unfolds. The hints as to why this person is going to kill that person are set up very poorly, so when they happen, they don't make enough sense.The production values were OK nothing stood out as being particularly good or bad. It was just blah. About the only interesting thing I found were that most of the girls had some meat on their bones. They weren't the skinny little things you usually see.

Other reviews have gone into good detail what this film is about, so I'll just fill in my own impressions.I am someone who enjoys watching films like this; and what I mean by &#34;like this&#34; are low budget films that are not theatrical releases and films that aren't meant to be great, but entertaining.I was entertained - pretty much.  The premise is not really original, tho I won't hold that against the film, and the outcome even more so.  I care more about how well the premise was executed.Not terribly badly, I'll say.  The actors are better than most I've seen for low-budget horror and the writing showed some good effort.  I couldn't really come to care about any of the characters, but I did not dislike any of them enough to stop watching.  The film is meant to be an emotional roller-coaster for the characters, and as annoying as it got, it was probably pretty true to what would happen if the circumstances were real.  People would be calm, then freak out, then go into denial, to feeling hopeful, and then back to freaking-out-hopelessness.That part got tedious, but thankfully, imo, it didn't drag on too long.  There was enough action and decision-making going on that even tho I knew almost right away that I would never watch this film again, I was glad I was watching it this once.The ending was better than I expected it to be, but the &#34;twist&#34; was really unnecessary and didn't add a thing, in my opinion.  If that &#34;twist&#34; had been left out nobody would have missed it at all.  The movie could well have ended in the basement and faded to black and been just as well off.Over all, I'm glad I saw this film and I will watch more of this series.  I won't watch it again, unless I forget that I watched it sometime in the future, but I don't regret taking a time out of my everyday life and giving it a chance.",2,"Well, it does kill some time...",1392422400,"02 15, 2014",2014,1974,"['would', ""n't"", 'say', 'bad', 'film', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'much', 'much', 'worse', 'also', 'would', ""n't"", 'say', 'good', 'film', 'Other', 'reviews', 'have', 'gone', 'good', 'detail', 'what', 'film', 'about', ""'ll"", 'just', 'fill', 'own', 'impressions.I', 'am', 'someone', 'who', 'watching', 'films', 'what', 'mean', '34', '34', 'are', 'low', 'budget', 'films', 'are', 'not', 'theatrical', 'releases', 'films', 'are', ""n't"", 'meant', 'be', 'great', 'entertaining.I', 'was', 'entertained', 'pretty', 'much', 'premise', 'not', 'really', 'original', 'tho', 'wo', ""n't"", 'hold', 'film', 'outcome', 'even', 'more', 'so', 'care', 'more', 'how', 'well', 'premise', 'was', 'executed.Not', 'terribly', 'badly', ""'ll"", 'say', 'actors', 'are', 'better', 'most', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'low-budget', 'horror', 'writing', 'showed', 'good', 'effort', 'could', ""n't"", 'really', 'come', 'care', 'characters', 'did', 'not', 'dislike', 'enough', 'stop', 'watching', 'film', 'meant', 'be', 'emotional', 'roller-coaster', 'characters', 'as', 'annoying', 'got', 'was', 'probably', 'pretty', 'true', 'what', 'would', 'happen', 'circumstances', 'were', 'real', 'People', 'would', 'be', 'calm', 'then', 'freak', 'out', 'then', 'go', 'denial', 'feeling', 'hopeful', 'then', 'back', 'freaking-out-hopelessness.That', 'part', 'got', 'tedious', 'thankfully', 'imo', 'did', ""n't"", 'drag', 'too', 'long', 'was', 'enough', 'action', 'decision-making', 'going', 'even', 'tho', 'knew', 'almost', 'right', 'away', 'would', 'never', 'watch', 'film', 'again', 'was', 'glad', 'was', 'watching', 'once.The', 'ending', 'was', 'better', 'expected', 'be', '34', 'twist', '34', 'was', 'really', 'unnecessary', 'did', ""n't"", 'add', 'thing', 'opinion', '34', 'twist', '34', 'had', 'been', 'left', 'out', 'nobody', 'would', 'have', 'missed', 'movie', 'could', 'well', 'have', 'ended', 'basement', 'faded', 'black', 'been', 'just', 'as', 'well', ""'m"", 'glad', 'saw', 'film', 'will', 'watch', 'more', 'series', 'wo', ""n't"", 'watch', 'again', 'forget', 'watched', 'sometime', 'future', 'do', ""n't"", 'regret', 'taking', 'time', 'everyday', 'life', 'giving', 'chance']",N/A

This might sound like Saw, but it's also the plot of Kill Theory.Kill Theory starts out with the usual college kids getting drunk at a party formula, with two exceptions: the fat awkward guy Freddy (Daniel Franzese) and the bad girl hot chick Alex (Taryn Manning). But there's another plot entirely at work here, that of the aggrieved psycho (Kevin Gage) who put our victims into the predicament in the first place.  Although everyone else has coupled up, the frat boys' brilliant plan is to set up fat kid with hot chick. This is a stupid plan.But then, these are stupid people.  These characters start off quite shallow - the hidden secrets they reveal aren't really character development so much as extensions of their stereotypes.  The fat kid, it turns out, really resents being the [...]of everyone's jokes.  The bad girl is a rebel. The rich kid is a sociopath. The stress of having to murder each other turns everyone into murderers, but then we wouldn't have much of a movie if they didn't.The cast, bless their hearts, tries hard.  Franzese gives a scenery-chewing performance as he slowly loses his mind.  Manning is supposed to be the hot bad girl, but she comes off as an awkward stereotype with raccoon eyes. Everyone pouts, past romances are revealed, and old wounds reopened.Kill Theory improves upon the genre in a few ways.  The killer is revealed early and we know his motivation.  His reasons become clear at the end of the movie. And the kill theory behind kill theory --- with enough stress anyone can be a killer -- is cleverly subverted.If anything, Kill Theory wraps up its plot points, delivers on its promises, and gives a definitive answer to its question. This doesn't make Kill Theory a great film.

It has a bit of ""Saw"" in it where ""normal"" folks are put in a group situation of dire straits and then they have to decide individually whether or not they will turn on their friends.  And but for a few minor flaws, the movie does what it does well and that's to shock, scare, and keep the viewer on the edge of their seats.The flick starts with a man in a sanitarium who is about to be released.  He's basically had a nervous breakdown because during a cliff climbing adventure, his rope was about to snap, so to save himself he cuts the rope below him which dooms three of his friends who fall to their death.  We do discover however he is not completely innocent because he was charged with 2nd degree murder as a result and he got a plea bargain to stay out of prison.Flashforward:  we have a group of 7 friends go to the weathly ones parent's lake house to celebrate their future graduation.  Hooking up with the stepsister who was vacationing there already, we have a group of eight who are by nightfall told that only one of them can survive or they all die by morning.  As a result, they are all must either trust or distrust their friends, girl/boyfriends, and stepsibling in a life or death game between some psycho but even more so, each other.Besides a few out of place exposition moments, the film really moves well.  The acting is really good and the emotional struggles the folks go through are as real as you'd think.  The bad quality of some of the people comes right out while others have hearts of gold.  Others in the group of 8 have qualities who are in the middle where they are very good folks but they also do not want to die and become conflicted and seem to bounce around before settling to mostly supportive and helpful roles within the group of friends.As a whole, this film is really good.  The people, though mostly good people, show the realism of a gray between the black and white of life but unlike most horror films with silly conversions to evil or over the top psychopaths, this film gives a new spin of people who fall closer to good without being silly caricatures of good and evil.  And some of their backstories make the weaker ones seem confused and more real.For the exploitation film buff from the blood and boobs crowd, there is definately a lot of blood and gore and the women are very, very attractive and dressed mostly in provocative clothing, not surprising for a summer time vacation at a lakehouse.

But, that said, this type of thing has been done, and done far better, quite recently despite being derivative (the 2009 British film Exam is one obvious example), so what is it about Kill Theory that makes it barely watchable at best? (Though I grant you, you knew ""barely watchable at best"" was coming the minute you saw ""After Dark Horrorfest"" on the box, didn't you?)Plot: deranged killer-type (Heat's Kevin Gage) traps a bunch of recent college grads in a secluded house and gives them an ultimatum: only one can survive. If more than one is still alive at sunrise, he will kill them all. After a bit of convincing that he's serious, they all start plotting against one another.The big difference between this and so very, very many other movies of this ilk is that the entire cast of young-and-beautifuls is made up of rising stars who are in that sweet spot--they're recognizable enough to be called stars, but are still not household names. The top dog of the bunch is Agnes Bruckner, who started out in such critically-acclaimed fare as The Glass House and Murder by Numbers and has since made really bad movie choices, but she's backed up with a bunch of kids who aren't slouches; Sons of Anarchy's Theo Rossi, 8 Mile's Taryn Manning, Mean Girls's Daniel Franzese, Brothers' Patrick John Flueger, and I could keep going until I'd filled an entire thousand-word review here. You get the picture--this is not some no-budget cast not capable of acting their way out of a collective paper bag, and the talent assembled in front of the camera in this movie is the only thing that saves it from becoming another intensely stupid new-model slasher a la Nine Lives. But director Chris Moore, working on his first feature (you know him as the producer of movies as wide-ranging as Good Will Hunting, American Pie, and Feast, but he has never directed before this), has very little idea of what to do with all this talent, and writer/producer Kelly C. Palmer (also debuting) does very little to help him in this regard; you know where all the twists are, and if you don't see the Big Reveal at the end coming within the first half-hour, you just haven't seen enough slasher films with mystery pretensions. Still, part of being onscreen talent who's actually, well, talented is that you actually know what to do in front of a camera even when faced with an incompetent director, so there are a few scenes here that actually work (mostly in the beginning, before the main piece of the plot falls into place and we're just getting to know the characters). That might be worth it, especially if you're a fan of any of the principals, as I am of Rossi's. Otherwise, you can let this one pass you by. **",2,"Great cast, nothing else.",1299542400,"03 8, 2011",2011,2863,"['Kill', 'Theory', 'Chris', 'Moore', '2007', 'call', 'movie', 'derivative', 'almost', 'redundant', 'will', 'be', 'brutally', 'obvious', 'ten', 'minutes', 'starting', 'watch', 'said', 'type', 'thing', 'been', 'done', 'done', 'far', 'better', 'quite', 'recently', 'being', 'derivative', '2009', 'British', 'film', 'Exam', 'one', 'obvious', 'example', 'what', 'Kill', 'Theory', 'barely', 'watchable', 'best', 'grant', 'knew', 'barely', 'watchable', 'best', 'was', 'coming', 'minute', 'saw', 'Dark', 'Horrorfest', 'box', 'did', ""n't"", 'Plot', 'deranged', 'killer-type', 'Heat', 'Kevin', 'Gage', 'bunch', 'recent', 'college', 'grads', 'secluded', 'house', 'ultimatum', 'only', 'one', 'can', 'survive', 'more', 'one', 'still', 'alive', 'sunrise', 'will', 'kill', 'bit', 'convincing', 'serious', 'start', 'plotting', 'one', 'another.The', 'big', 'difference', 'so', 'very', 'very', 'many', 'other', 'movies', 'ilk', 'entire', 'cast', 'young-and-beautifuls', 'made', 'rising', 'stars', 'who', 'are', 'sweet', 'spot', ""'re"", 'recognizable', 'enough', 'be', 'called', 'stars', 'are', 'still', 'not', 'household', 'names', 'top', 'dog', 'bunch', 'Agnes', 'Bruckner', 'who', 'started', 'out', 'such', 'critically-acclaimed', 'fare', 'Glass', 'House', 'Murder', 'Numbers', 'made', 'really', 'bad', 'movie', 'choices', 'backed', 'up', 'bunch', 'kids', 'who', 'are', ""n't"", 'slouches', 'Sons', 'Anarchy', 'Theo', 'Rossi', '8', 'Mile', 'Taryn', 'Manning', 'Mean', 'Girls', 'Daniel', 'Franzese', 'Brothers', 'Patrick', 'John', 'Flueger', 'could', 'keep', 'going', ""'d"", 'filled', 'entire', 'thousand-word', 'review', 'here', 'get', 'picture', 'not', 'no-budget', 'cast', 'not', 'capable', 'acting', 'way', 'collective', 'paper', 'bag', 'talent', 'assembled', 'front', 'camera', 'movie', 'only', 'thing', 'becoming', 'intensely', 'stupid', 'new-model', 'slasher', 'la', 'Nine', 'director', 'Chris', 'Moore', 'working', 'first', 'feature', 'know', 'producer', 'movies', 'wide-ranging', 'Good', 'Will', 'Hunting', 'American', 'Pie', 'Feast', 'never', 'directed', 'very', 'little', 'idea', 'what', 'do', 'talent', 'writer/producer', 'Kelly', 'C.', 'Palmer', 'also', 'debuting', 'very', 'little', 'help', 'regard', 'know', 'where', 'twists', 'are', 'do', ""n't"", 'see', 'Big', 'Reveal', 'end', 'coming', 'first', 'half-hour', 'just', 'have', ""n't"", 'seen', 'enough', 'slasher', 'films', 'mystery', 'pretensions', 'Still', 'part', 'being', 'onscreen', 'talent', 'who', 'actually', 'well', 'talented', 'actually', 'know', 'what', 'do', 'front', 'camera', 'even', 'when', 'faced', 'incompetent', 'director', 'are', 'few', 'scenes', 'here', 'actually', 'work', 'mostly', 'beginning', 'main', 'piece', 'plot', 'place', ""'re"", 'just', 'getting', 'know', 'characters', 'might', 'be', 'especially', ""'re"", 'fan', 'principals', 'am', 'Rossi', 'Otherwise', 'can', 'let', 'one', 'pass', '**']",N/A

It's like Saw but with college kids. The story is a theory of a madman that a group of people when trapped and given an ultimatum that only one of the group will live to be set free and the friends will have to kill each other.  And they do, including one guy who's head is pulverized to a bloody pulp by a shovel.Naturally the friends are in a house miles from the closest town, land-lines and cell-phones don't work but the movie has some clever twists including the friends growing paranoia towards the next one and a few are dispatched by the madman when they attempt to escape.

1320695,A24K6KR7RHW7XB,B00344EALY,Ron,"[0, 0]","Kill Theory has a good and promissing premise to its story, but the execution left me sighing in the end. I even watched it twice several weeks apart to see if that might make a difference in my opinion, but I still came to the same conclusion that its an ok movie.The story plays out like a rehearsal that you've done at least one to many times and leaves you looking forward to when its over. Most of the usual college kid characters here have little redeeming value and are more annoying than anything else. So it leaves you saying to yourself who cares if the die just get it over with will you! There are a couple of decent characters, so its not a total &#34;kill em all&#34; scenario, but close.The evil stalker character is pretty well defined and their agenda is quite clear from the start and so to is the person who the message is intended for.The movie does have a few things going for it like an attractive cast with a few familiar faces. Its cinematography is well shot with nice locations (home, lake and woods). The overall production values are very good for the genre. The direction and writing is where this one takes some hits and by that I mean the predictable and nonsensical actions taken by much of the cast. Some tweaking here and there and this could be more exciting and less predictable and a whole lot more scary/fun to watch.There is more than enough four letter words flying about, but not at a rapid fire rate like some. There is some nudity and sex scenes, but again not an over abundance or just plain gratuitous for the sake of. It does have a few fairly violent scenes(gun shots, knife wounds, fireplace pokers etc.) with one graphic bludgeon(like in Walking Dead) scene that gore hounds will enjoy and a couple other decent gore fest scenes thrown in here and there.I will give this three stars for production values(attractive cast, gore and locations). This movie is a good choice when all your choices are either 1 or 2 stars. This one comes in a little higher and isn't a total waste of time and my or may not put you to sleep!",3,WELL???,1393027200,"02 22, 2014",2014,2068,"['Kill', 'Theory', 'good', 'promissing', 'premise', 'story', 'execution', 'left', 'sighing', 'end', 'even', 'watched', 'twice', 'several', 'weeks', 'apart', 'see', 'might', 'make', 'difference', 'opinion', 'still', 'came', 'same', 'conclusion', 'ok', 'movie.The', 'story', 'out', 'rehearsal', ""'ve"", 'done', 'least', 'one', 'many', 'times', 'looking', 'forward', 'when', 'Most', 'usual', 'college', 'kid', 'characters', 'here', 'have', 'little', 'redeeming', 'value', 'are', 'more', 'annoying', 'anything', 'else', 'saying', 'yourself', 'who', 'die', 'just', 'get', 'over', 'will', 'are', 'couple', 'decent', 'characters', 'so', 'not', 'total', '34', 'kill', '34', 'scenario', 'close.The', 'evil', 'stalker', 'character', 'pretty', 'well', 'defined', 'agenda', 'quite', 'clear', 'start', 'so', 'person', 'who', 'message', 'intended', 'for.The', 'movie', 'have', 'few', 'things', 'going', 'attractive', 'cast', 'few', 'familiar', 'cinematography', 'well', 'shot', 'nice', 'locations', 'home', 'lake', 'woods', 'overall', 'production', 'values', 'are', 'very', 'good', 'genre', 'direction', 'writing', 'where', 'one', 'hits', 'mean', 'predictable', 'nonsensical', 'actions', 'taken', 'much', 'cast', 'tweaking', 'here', 'there', 'could', 'be', 'more', 'exciting', 'less', 'predictable', 'whole', 'lot', 'more', 'scary/fun', 'watch.There', 'more', 'enough', 'four', 'letter', 'words', 'flying', 'about', 'not', 'rapid', 'fire', 'rate', 'nudity', 'sex', 'scenes', 'again', 'not', 'abundance', 'just', 'plain', 'gratuitous', 'sake', 'have', 'few', 'fairly', 'violent', 'scenes', 'gun', 'shots', 'knife', 'wounds', 'fireplace', 'pokers', 'etc', 'one', 'graphic', 'bludgeon', 'Walking', 'Dead', 'scene', 'gore', 'hounds', 'will', 'enjoy', 'couple', 'other', 'decent', 'gore', 'fest', 'scenes', 'thrown', 'here', 'there.I', 'will', 'give', 'three', 'stars', 'production', 'values', 'attractive', 'cast', 'gore', 'locations', 'movie', 'good', 'choice', 'when', 'choices', 'are', '1', '2', 'stars', 'one', 'little', 'higher', ""n't"", 'total', 'waste', 'time', 'may', 'not', 'put', 'sleep']",N/A

I can say this, it's already better than most of the entries in the last three combined (not ALL, but most).  The setup is achingly familiar - group of young adults head off to a remote house in the woods to party for graduation.  Killer stalks them one by one . . . etcBut, there is a variation on the theme here.  Instead of the slasher doing all the slashing, he sets it up for our characters to do the slashing for him.  After killing one of them, he leaves instructions with the rest that the same fate awaits ALL of them, unless by 6am, all but one of them have killed each other.  If one person walks out of the house, that person survives.  But if they don't kill each other, HE will kill them all.The imaginative premise, preposterous as it is, serves to lift the film out of the usual teen slasher genre.  Matched with decent performances, quality camera and editing work, and an unfolding screenplay that allows the characters to make smart or at least reasonable choices - this movie gets the 4th annual Horrorfest off to a decent start.The film features a decent amount of blood, including a pretty nasty bludgeoning death - but most of the gore comes from stabbings and shootings - nothing too extreme in the blood-and-guts department.Of course, it's not all perfection - the opening act drags as we meet the characters and learn what their little hang-ups are.  The decision to hide the killer's face had me prepared for some major twist in the end, which never came, leaving me puzzled as to why they hid his identity - perhaps they thought it would make him creepier?  Of course, you have the one gratuitous boob shoot early on, for no other reason than to be there. And as I said, the entire plot is fairly convoluted - it basically requires that we believe this man would go to such extremes simply to ""make a point"" about human nature, all because he's upset he had to plead guilty to murder when he cut his climbing partners from a fraying rope a decade ago.  The setup of the wicked challenge lends the film a SAW feel, without all the nasty traps.  As such, even in its imaginativeness, it is derivative.In the end, it's no classic, but it certainly stands a cut above the norm for the Afterdark series - I was engaged by it enough to want to finish it, even if I'll never bother to watch it again.",3,Imaginative Premise . . .

I was intrigued enough to buy it. Of course what Syfy airs is either a hit or a miss.

Loved it! You are like ""Yes that makes sense!"" It ties in some parts on how he had pics of them and so forth. And apparently he proved something to his doctor alright lol!!

1320700,A6VXZ1EEPRTLV,B00344EALY,trebe,"[0, 0]","Part of After Dark Horrorfest 4, Kill Theory (2009) directed by Chris Moore, features a twisted variation of the kill or die scenario, when a group of friends is forced to turn on each other.  Once set in motion, events play out dramatically and violently, though not very credibly, as the characters demonstrate few critical thinking skills, and a fair amount of treachery.The instigator of the mayhem is a fellow named Walter (Kevin Gage) who to save his own life while mountain climbing, cut a rope that sent three of his friends to their deaths.  Tried and convicted of manslaughter, Walter spends several years in a mental institution, before being conditionally released.  Unfortunately Walter still has issues, and seeking closure, he sets in motion a deadly scheme.Seven friends gather at a home in the country, to celebrate their upcoming graduation from college.  Shortly after the group settles in for the night, Nicole (Steffi Wickens) is abducted while grabbing a snack.  Soon after, Nicole's dead body is hurled through a window, awakening everyone in the house.  Cut into the dead girl's belly, are the letters ""TV"".  The group, switches on the television, and view a video narrated by the killer.  It shows Nicole being urged to shoot her sleeping boyfriend, and then later having refused, they witness the killer slitting her throat.  Walter says that if more than one person is alive in the house at 6am, they will be killed.  If only one person is alive, then no harm will come to them.  For those in the house, the options are either all will die, or only one will survive the night.There is some panicking and a lot of loud discussion, however not a lot of rational behavior comes from it.  Cell phones don't work, and there is apparently no internet, so the group is on their own.  Anyone who leaves the house is apparently fair game, as the killer has traps planted at various locations, and also has a rifle.  The group attempts to escape in the only available vehicle, but the Killer disables it using another trap.  Paranoia grows stronger, as people start to die, and the Killer steps in to provide some additional motivation.  The survivors start to crack under pressure, and turn on each other in an overdramatic last act, that is terribly written and acted.  In the end, Walter does gain some closure, and the reason why the group was chosen for his experiment, is revealed.The film creates a situation, cranks up the pressure, tosses in a few weapons, and then some selfish unlikeable characters, destroy each other.  It doesn't plays out in a very credible way.  The Killer can't be everywhere, so if they had just split up and gone in different directions, the situation would have fallen apart, or at least more would probably have survived.  For whatever reason, the victims apparently believe that the Killer will actually keep his word, and spare the sole survivor.  Through this turns out to be the case, there is really no reason for that trust.The cast do a decent job with what they are given, but the screenplay doesn't do them any favors, having them behave like morons, who stab each other in the back for silly reasons.  Almost everything feels fake and stilted towards achieving the desired goal.  Starring Agnes Bruckner, Patrick Flueger, Ryanne Duzich, Teddy Dunn, Steffi Wickens, Daniel Franzese, and Theo Rossi, the film is worth a watch for the very curious, or those that prefer a slasher type flick with a downbeat ending.",2,like a chicken with its head cut off...,1299283200,"03 5, 2011",2011,3475,"['Part', 'Dark', 'Horrorfest', '4', 'Kill', 'Theory', '2009', 'directed', 'Chris', 'Moore', 'twisted', 'variation', 'kill', 'die', 'scenario', 'when', 'group', 'friends', 'forced', 'turn', 'other', 'Once', 'set', 'motion', 'events', 'play', 'out', 'dramatically', 'violently', 'not', 'very', 'credibly', 'characters', 'demonstrate', 'few', 'critical', 'thinking', 'skills', 'fair', 'amount', 'treachery.The', 'instigator', 'mayhem', 'fellow', 'named', 'Walter', 'Kevin', 'Gage', 'who', 'save', 'own', 'life', 'mountain', 'climbing', 'cut', 'rope', 'sent', 'three', 'friends', 'deaths', 'Tried', 'convicted', 'manslaughter', 'Walter', 'several', 'years', 'mental', 'institution', 'being', 'conditionally', 'released', 'Unfortunately', 'Walter', 'still', 'issues', 'seeking', 'closure', 'motion', 'deadly', 'scheme.Seven', 'friends', 'gather', 'home', 'country', 'celebrate', 'upcoming', 'graduation', 'college', 'Shortly', 'group', 'night', 'Nicole', 'Steffi', 'Wickens', 'abducted', 'grabbing', 'snack', 'Soon', 'Nicole', 'dead', 'body', 'hurled', 'window', 'awakening', 'everyone', 'house', 'Cut', 'dead', 'girl', 'belly', 'are', 'letters', 'TV', 'group', 'television', 'view', 'video', 'narrated', 'killer', 'Nicole', 'being', 'urged', 'shoot', 'sleeping', 'boyfriend', 'then', 'later', 'having', 'refused', 'witness', 'killer', 'slitting', 'throat', 'Walter', 'more', 'one', 'person', 'alive', 'house', '6am', 'will', 'be', 'killed', 'only', 'one', 'person', 'alive', 'then', 'harm', 'will', 'come', 'house', 'options', 'are', 'will', 'die', 'only', 'one', 'will', 'survive', 'night.There', 'panicking', 'lot', 'loud', 'discussion', 'however', 'not', 'lot', 'rational', 'behavior', 'Cell', 'phones', 'do', ""n't"", 'work', 'apparently', 'internet', 'group', 'own', 'Anyone', 'who', 'house', 'apparently', 'fair', 'game', 'killer', 'traps', 'planted', 'various', 'locations', 'also', 'rifle', 'group', 'escape', 'only', 'available', 'vehicle', 'Killer', 'using', 'trap', 'Paranoia', 'stronger', 'people', 'start', 'die', 'Killer', 'steps', 'provide', 'additional', 'motivation', 'survivors', 'start', 'crack', 'pressure', 'turn', 'other', 'overdramatic', 'last', 'act', 'terribly', 'written', 'acted', 'end', 'Walter', 'gain', 'closure', 'reason', 'why', 'group', 'was', 'chosen', 'experiment', 'revealed.The', 'film', 'situation', 'up', 'pressure', 'few', 'weapons', 'then', 'selfish', 'unlikeable', 'characters', 'destroy', 'other', ""n't"", 'plays', 'out', 'very', 'credible', 'way', 'Killer', 'ca', ""n't"", 'be', 'everywhere', 'so', 'had', 'just', 'split', 'up', 'gone', 'different', 'directions', 'situation', 'would', 'have', 'fallen', 'apart', 'least', 'more', 'would', 'probably', 'have', 'survived', 'reason', 'victims', 'apparently', 'believe', 'Killer', 'will', 'actually', 'keep', 'word', 'spare', 'sole', 'survivor', 'out', 'be', 'case', 'really', 'reason', 'trust.The', 'cast', 'do', 'decent', 'job', 'what', 'are', 'given', 'screenplay', ""n't"", 'do', 'favors', 'having', 'behave', 'morons', 'who', 'stab', 'other', 'back', 'silly', 'reasons', 'Almost', 'everything', 'feels', 'fake', 'stilted', 'towards', 'achieving', 'desired', 'goal', 'Starring', 'Agnes', 'Bruckner', 'Patrick', 'Flueger', 'Ryanne', 'Duzich', 'Teddy', 'Dunn', 'Steffi', 'Wickens', 'Daniel', 'Franzese', 'Theo', 'Rossi', 'film', 'watch', 'very', 'curious', 'prefer', 'slasher', 'type', 'flick', 'downbeat', 'ending']",N/A
