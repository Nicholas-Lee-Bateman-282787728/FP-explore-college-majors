Tho the movie storyline/script could use a boost, it is James Woods that makes this film a 'wanna see'.  Naturally handsome, he is just a great actor in any role he plays.

143334,A2PBV1899CX3TE,0792839498,"C. CRADDOCK ""Cr@$#!!!!""","[2, 3]","The Boost (1988) is slightly notorious because Sean Young met co star James Woods on the set, and afterwards they accused each other of stalking. Woods claimed in court that Young left a disfigured ""voodoo doll"" on his doorstep, among other charges and counter charges.The Boost went down as follows: Lenny Brown (James Woods) is a salesman who thinks big. He wants so bad to succeed--for himself, and for his beautiful wife, Linda (Sean Young). Thinking Ned (John Rothman) might be a potential rich client, he makes a pitch only to find that he doesn't have a load of money. To make up for the misunderstanding Lenny takes him out to lunch.Lenny Brown: If you saw Linda and me at a restaurant like this, you'd say, ""There's a mismatch."" I've seen it in people's eyes: ""How did a guy like HIM get a girl like HER? He must be rich.""... Not that I'm not trying.And try he does. He pitches some BIG ideas for a shopping mall development to some suspender wearers at a board meeting, but they aren't feeling him.Lenny: Gentlemen, I won't bore you with the reading of my resume, some of which is actually true... We're born again with each new project. And all your past successes don't cut much ice when it comes to the Big Question: Will It Sell?... Sure, it'll sell. Over the life of the partnership, everyone will enjoy some small tax benefits... realize a nice, safe-though-modest return on their investment. You don't need me for that. But will it SOAR? That's another question... People struggle against smallness all their lives. Let them identify with something BIG!Everyone is indifferent to him except for Max Sherman (Steven Hill), who sees the potential in Lenny Brown. Max sees that Lenny has the makings of being a great salesman, but senses that he is still struggling, waiting for a break. He asks him how he is doing.Lenny: I do all right. Everything I do is just a lot chancier, that's all.Max: You just probably haven't found the right products yet, the right territory.Max flies him and Linda out to LA and shows him the Real Estate Business. They are actually more in the business of tax shelters, and they pitch deals with the angle of tax loopholes making them irresistible investments. There are piles of money in Los Angeles, and if it isn't invested, it will all go to Uncle Sam. Lenny catches on quick, and with Max showing him the ropes and introducing him to clients, he really starts to take off.Max: [at Morton's Restaurant] ... This is my table. Everybody knows where I sit: waiters, guests, the whole bit... Look around you. A lot of tables, right? Wrong. Five tables. All the rest of the people come here to eat... Ray Tucker. Manages the money for half the Rams, all the Raiders, and anybody you ever saw on TV. Five percent off the top... Carter Davis, oil... Ricky Holtz, builds airports... Doc Gertz. He used to be a chiropractor; now he produces movies... And me. The five of us don't come here to eat.Lenny: So what are you saying, I shouldn't order any food?Max: Oh, no. Eat. Just don't look hungry.Soon Lenny is succeeding beyond his wildest dreams. He is invited to a lavish Hollywood party by Joel Miller (John Kapelos), who has made a fortune from a chain of carwashes.Joel: [at his first party] Welcome. Eat, drink, and make contacts.Linda: Joel throws a nice party, doesn't he?Lenny: What's REALLY nice is that Uncle Sam pays for half. And HE wasn't even invited.This could be the ultimate Horatio Alger, rags-to-riches, story. The American Dream. But his wife Linda worries about the fast lane they are on, the rocket they have strapped themselves to.Linda: Maybe we're going too fast. We should just take this a step at a time.Lenny: To hell with that. You don't STEP through life. ""Teacher, may I?"" It goes too quick for that. You gotta LEAP through life!Oh, the hubris! Can you see where this is going? When the Wall Street Journal prints an article that says the government is going to close the tax loopholes, it has a chilling effect on business. No deals whatsoever, and the ones that just closed are all calling wanting their money back. Lenny Brown is in deep dept, and deeper trouble. He doesn't want to show the world that he is beaten, so he puts on a brave face and goes to Joel's party. Joel sees through the facade and tries to give his friend a ""boost."" Seeing the title of this movie, I thought it was a caper movie, about a heist or a scam or something. I should have had a clue from the fact that it takes place in 1988 in Hollywood.Joel: [introducing Lenny to cocaine] Faith may move mountains; this stuff makes them FLY.It is all downhill from there, and James Woods gives what I think is the performance of his career. Sean Young, Steven Hill, John Kapelos, and the rest of the able cast give great support, but it is up to Woods to take Lenny Brown from obnoxious but honest and hardworking salesman to a cold hearted hope to die drug fiend, expertly hitting all the phases and stages in between. This film was made on a low budget, but you get the feeling that it was a story that had to be told, what it really must have been like at that unique time and place in Los Angeles and Hollywood. A cautionary tale.Lenny: [responding to Mark's job offer] Mark, I don't sell drugs. I'm in real estate.Mark: I don't sell drugs, either. I'm a screenwriter. But until the ship comes in, you gotta cover the waterfront.Ten Other Things that pertain to The Boost in various and sundry ways:1.Ludes: A Ballad of the Drug & the Dream: (1983) The screenplay was based on this book by Benjamin Stein. Is this the same Ben Stein who played the nasally-voiced principle in Ferris Bueller's Day Off?2.The Onion Field: (1979) This is the breakthrough role for James Woods. He played a cold blooded cop killer in this film based on the book by former cop turned novelist Joseph Wambaugh.3.Salvador (Special Edition): (1986) Woods' portrayal of a journalist in El Salvador garnered him an Oscar nomination. Directed by Oliver Stone.4.Nixon - Collector's Edition: (1995) Woods was a very convincing H.R. Haldeman in Nixon, also directed by Oliver Stone.5.Dirty Pictures: (2000) This made for TV dramatization/documentary of the flap caused by a Robert Maplethorpe photography exhibition in Cincinnati starred Woods as museum director Dennis Barrie.6.Blade Runner - The Final Cut (Two-Disc Special Edition): (1982) Sean Young played the replicant, Rachael, opposite Harrison Ford, in the classic sci fi film based on Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep? by Phillip K. Dick.7.Dune (1984) [HD DVD]: (1984) Sean Young played Chani in this sci fi epic directed by David Lynch.8.Batman: (1989) Sean Young was cast as Vicky Vale but due to a horse riding injury sustained the day before shooting was to begin was replaced by Kim Basinger.9.Batman Returns: (1992) Sean Young Dressed up as ""Catwoman"" and attempted to confront Tim Burton and Michael Keaton on the Warner Bros. property in an unsuccessful attempt to get the role.10.The Diving Bell and the Butterfly: (2007) Actress Sean Young was escorted from the Directors Guild Of America Awards show for heckling filmmaker Julian Schnabel, nominated for his film The Diving Bell And The Butterfly. Schnabel was the last of the five Best Director nominees to take the stage to make a speech at the Los Angeles ceremony - but, after a few moments, he was forced to stop when Young shouted, ""Come on - get to it!"" A shocked Schnabel stopped to find out the identity of his heckler, and asked Young to finish his speech for him. Schnabel then returned to his speech after receiving encouragement from the star-studded audience, while Young was escorted out of the venue by two security guards, falling over as she left. Soon after she voluntarily checked herself into a rehabilitation center on January 28, 2008 to deal with her longtime alcoholism.",4,"We're not out of the Woods yet, James",1212537600,"06 4,

In fact if you ever wanted to know what its like to be addicted to cocaine, just watch this movie.This movie is simply the most powerful depiction I have seen of the devastating effects drugs can have on people.  James Woods is brilliant, and the gradual erosion of his life seems to happen without his knowledge.  Like the frog boiling in water, it all slips away subtly and quietly.  In the end, he depicts the painful and harsh reality of a person who cannot see that he is in any way at fault, and if he gets just &quot;one more break&quot; it will all work out again.Tremendous film and a very under-rated performance by Woods.",5,Amazing and realistic look at how powerful drugs are!,1071532800,"12 16, 2003",2003,820,"['are', 'who', 'would', 'like', 'legalize', 'drugs', 'ought', 'watch', 'film', 'are', 'who', 'think', 'drug', 'addiction', 'just', 'excuse', 'ought', 'watch', 'film', 'fact', 'ever', 'wanted', 'know', 'what', 'like', 'be', 'addicted', 'cocaine', 'just', 'watch', 'movie.This', 'movie', 'simply', 'most', 'powerful', 'depiction', 'have', 'seen', 'devastating', 'effects', 'drugs', 'can', 'have', 'people', 'James', 'Woods', 'brilliant', 'gradual', 'erosion', 'life', 'happen', 'knowledge', 'frog', 'boiling', 'water', 'away', 'subtly', 'quietly', 'end', 'painful', 'harsh', 'reality', 'person', 'who', 'can', 'not', 'see', 'way', 'fault', 'just', 'quot', 'one', 'more', 'break', 'quot', 'will', 'work', 'out', 'again.Tremendous', 'film', 'very', 'under-rated', 'performance', 'Woods']",N/A

143345,A15W2D3WJW7NP7,0792839498,Pork Chop,"[2, 2]","THE BOOST (1988) is a remarkable movie, that certainly broke ground at the time it was released, from its astonishing honesty, courage and acting skill shown as the story is told of  a salesman who pushes big dollar projects, ideas and  schemes in various markets, butabove for tax shelters  (such as oil drilling depreciation, sold off as tax shelters in the form of limited partnerships to wealthy  investors who have nothing to lose because they are in the highest tax brackets possible.)Too often, creative and unique works such as this one, are only released by Independent film makers, unfortunately, or never made.First, James Woods is shown starting off with a very small-time gig, but turns it into a mega-deal, as  Steven Hill becomes his mentor and introduces him to the proper places, people and business opportunities for Woods to work his magic.The film has a number of zingers, funny quips, such as ""Out here, the ball has to drop in the basket from Day 1"", or "" Eat, but don't look hungry!"", ""No sentiment, is the problem with the new generation!"" etc.The film does a fabulous job in depicting the euphoria of success, as Woods accepts clients from various livelihoods, from money launderers/ drug dealers with $75k cash, to medical doctors, and others. Leased and purchased luxury cars, million dollar villas with outdoor pool, private airplane, thoughtless speculation in the half a million range on tourism projects with decision making based  on feeling alone and peer pressure,  as well as  an expensive coke habit, demonstrate the extent to which Woods's characters had become out of touch with reality,  rather than saving for a rainy day, which actually does come round shortly after, as the tax authorities change the rules.The final analysis holds little back,  as Woods loses all that brought meaning to his life, as he embezzles from his mentor to feed his coke habit, turns into a wife beater, loses all luxuries  leased, rented or owned, his self-respect, his calm and balance in face of obstacles such as when  others question his skill, reputation, creativity and wisdom, etc. The miscarriage of a baby is  the least of his worries, as temptation to revert to addiction proves too strong over a period of time.The music, filming is professional, as there is no distraction whatsoever from the underlyingscript, unfolding of the action from those aspects.The film is castrated somewhat in the impact and meaning that the original film maker  intended, from an over-zeal in the editing room, removing many scenes that some might characterize as bordering on depravity, when in reality, it could be showing people being themselves in all their weaknesses and flaws.The paradox,  is casting having chosen an actress, Sean Young, who outdoes herself in the sincerity, realism, and warmth she brings to the screen, yet, at the same time, seems too normal, too modest  or shy, soft spoken, real, or simple for the role,  with dealing with Wood's manic-depressive personality.The last 2/3 of the movie is almost entirely about the ravages and damage that a narocotics addiction can unleash on the addicts, as individuals evolve into a pattern  of temper tantrums, rages, futile behavior, over-confidence and the errors that  later  occur from that ( as does when one thinks one can never do wrong.)Woods is shown first, sniffing lines, but later, taking ludes, then using a crack pipe, often over-indulging in alcohol when at  the table with  business guests. Addicts turn to living in a bubble, with no heed  paid to news developments published in the business media  affecting the prosperity of  underlying operations  and livelihood.Overall, this movie is a gem, by  showing a couple with genuine chemistry on the screen (Young and Woods) in the prime of their adulthoods, each playing realistic roles, filmed professionally, such that the audience is glued to the screen, accompanying the turn of events, pulled into an imaginary world of excess, euphoric highs and lull  lows, in between the total irresponsibility and loss of control  of the  2 protagonists.",4,Depicting the euphoria of success,1218153600,"08 8, 2008",2008,4088,"['BOOST', '1988', 'remarkable', 'movie', 'certainly', 'broke', 'ground', 'time', 'was', 'released', 'astonishing', 'honesty', 'courage', 'acting', 'skill', 'shown', 'story', 'told', 'salesman', 'who', 'big', 'dollar', 'projects', 'ideas', 'schemes', 'various', 'markets', 'butabove', 'tax', 'shelters', 'such', 'oil', 'drilling', 'depreciation', 'sold', 'off', 'tax', 'shelters', 'form', 'limited', 'partnerships', 'wealthy', 'investors', 'who', 'have', 'nothing', 'lose', 'are', 'highest', 'tax', 'brackets', 'possible', 'Too', 'often', 'creative', 'unique', 'works', 'such', 'one', 'are', 'only', 'released', 'Independent', 'film', 'makers', 'unfortunately', 'never', 'made.First', 'James', 'Woods', 'shown', 'starting', 'off', 'very', 'small-time', 'gig', 'mega-deal', 'Steven', 'Hill', 'mentor', 'proper', 'places', 'people', 'business', 'opportunities', 'Woods', 'work', 'magic.The', 'film', 'number', 'zingers', 'funny', 'quips', 'such', 'here', 'ball', 'drop', 'basket', 'Day', '1', 'Eat', 'do', ""n't"", 'look', 'hungry', 'sentiment', 'problem', 'new', 'generation', 'etc.The', 'film', 'fabulous', 'job', 'depicting', 'euphoria', 'success', 'Woods', 'clients', 'various', 'livelihoods', 'money', 'launderers/', 'drug', 'dealers', '75k', 'cash', 'medical', 'doctors', 'others', 'Leased', 'purchased', 'luxury', 'cars', 'million', 'dollar', 'villas', 'outdoor', 'pool', 'private', 'airplane', 'thoughtless', 'speculation', 'half', 'million', 'range', 'tourism', 'projects', 'decision', 'making', 'based', 'feeling', 'alone', 'peer', 'pressure', 'as', 'well', 'expensive', 'coke', 'habit', 'demonstrate', 'extent', 'Woods', 'characters', 'had', 'become', 'touch', 'reality', 'rather', 'saving', 'rainy', 'day', 'actually', 'come', 'round', 'shortly', 'tax', 'authorities', 'change', 'rules.The', 'final', 'analysis', 'little', 'back', 'Woods', 'brought', 'meaning', 'life', 'mentor', 'feed', 'coke', 'habit', 'wife', 'beater', 'luxuries', 'leased', 'rented', 'owned', 'self-respect', 'calm', 'balance', 'face', 'obstacles', 'such', 'when', 'others', 'question', 'skill', 'reputation', 'creativity', 'wisdom', 'etc', 'miscarriage', 'baby', 'least', 'worries', 'temptation', 'revert', 'addiction', 'proves', 'too', 'strong', 'period', 'time.The', 'music', 'filming', 'professional', 'distraction', 'whatsoever', 'underlyingscript', 'unfolding', 'action', 'aspects.The', 'film', 'castrated', 'somewhat', 'impact', 'meaning', 'original', 'film', 'maker', 'intended', 'over-zeal', 'editing', 'room', 'removing', 'many', 'scenes', 'might', 'characterize', 'bordering', 'depravity', 'when', 'reality', 'could', 'be', 'showing', 'people', 'being', 'weaknesses', 'flaws.The', 'paradox', 'casting', 'having', 'chosen', 'actress', 'Sean', 'Young', 'who', 'sincerity', 'realism', 'warmth', 'screen', 'yet', 'same', 'time', 'too', 'normal', 'too', 'modest', 'shy', 'soft', 'spoken', 'real', 'simple', 'role', 'dealing', 'Wood', 'manic-depressive', 'personality.The', 'last', '2/3', 'movie', 'almost', 'entirely', 'ravages', 'damage', 'narocotics', 'addiction', 'can', 'unleash', 'addicts', 'individuals', 'evolve', 'pattern', 'temper', 'tantrums', 'rages', 'futile', 'behavior', 'over-confidence', 'errors', 'later', 'occur', 'when', 'one', 'one', 'can', 'never', 'do', 'wrong', 'Woods', 'shown', 'first', 'sniffing', 'lines', 'later', 'taking', 'ludes', 'then', 'using', 'crack', 'pipe', 'often', 'over-indulging', 'alcohol', 'when', 'table', 'business', 'guests', 'Addicts', 'turn', 'living', 'bubble', 'heed', 'paid', 'news', 'developments', 'published', 'business', 'media', 'affecting', 'prosperity', 'underlying', 'operations', 'livelihood.Overall', 'movie', 'gem', 'showing', 'couple', 'genuine', 'chemistry', 'screen', 'Young', 'Woods', 'prime', 'adulthoods', 'playing', 'realistic', 'roles', 'filmed', 'professionally', 'such', 'audience', 'glued', 'screen', 'accompanying', 'turn', 'events', 'pulled', 'imaginary', 'world', 'excess', 'euphoric', 'highs', 'lull', 'lows', 'total', 'irresponsibility', 'loss', 'control', '2', 'protagonists']",N/A
