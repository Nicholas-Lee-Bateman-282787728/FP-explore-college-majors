1084103,AXKLJRDTPJCA7,B000RW5CAE,Boss Fan,"[6, 16]","I saw this one at my local video store and was attracted to the title.  I figured it would be lousy, but good for a few laughs in the so-bad-its good realm and some gratuitous nudity.  I also figured it would be cheaply produced, but, hey, it's at the video store and out on DVD so I never would have expected it wouldn't be a real movie.  It is not.  Some people like to say movies look like home movies as a way to describe how cheap a film looks.  It is usually an exaggeration.  This is actually a home movie!  It is shot with a camcorder!  The first five minutes of the movie is just a shot from a camcorder set up on a tripod.  There are no close ups, the camera does not move or cut.  The scene is poorly lit, poorly miced and the actors are off in the distance.  Every other scene is the same.  Often the lighting is so poor you can't see what is going on.  The sound and voices drop in and out, sometimes the characters sound distant other times they are too loud.  The camera always just sits there.  The picture is grainy.  This is a home movie.  I have seen student films better than this and low grade porn with better production values and better performances.  I don't say that as an insult, again, the way phrases like this are usually used in movie reviews, but as the God's honest truth.  In the YouTube generation I realize everyone has a voice and armature film makers have an outlet to show their work.  But home videos should stay on YouTube.  They should not go into the marketplace as ""movies,"" duping unsuspecting buyers at places like Amazon who think they are getting a quality-made flick (again, no one would be expecting ""Star Wars"" quality filmmaking here, but actual, multiple cameras and Hollywood, professional editing equipment are the very least you expect for a movie being sold as an actual movie).  What if I put some crappy movie I made with my pals up at Amazon and charged $20 bucks for it?  Apparently it would be OK.  I really can't believe this is being sold to the public in actual video stores and on sites like this.  Forget the movie itself (I turned the horrendous thing off after 20 minutes), I just want to warn potential buyers (or even renters) this is as close to stealing as Amazon can get.

1084105,A3KF4IP2MUS8QQ,B000RW5CAE,"Daniel Jolley ""darkgenius""","[3, 3]","Given the title, it's pretty obvious from the get-go that this is going to be a really stupid slasher film, and the opening credits leave no room for doubt by informing viewers that the film was ""shot and cut to hell"" by Jeff  Smith.  (Smith also directed, co-wrote, and otherwise contributed to just about every aspect of the movie.)  If nothing else, you can't criticize Stupid Teenagers Must Die for pretending to be something it's not.  That's good because even the slightest trace of pretension could well have made this movie completely unwatchable.  Obviously, a good many critics and viewers banish it to one-star hell already, but I believe it does have a few entertaining moments - and the gore isn't half-bad for such a low-budget production (I especially liked the range of arterial blood sprays).Basically, you have a group of teenaged stereotypes lifted right out of the 1980s (i.e., characters) come together in a murder house to conduct a s&eacute;ance.  Naturally, they pool all of their car keys together so no one can up and leave in the middle of things - this becomes a problem because they keys disappear right about the time that the kids start dying grisly deaths.  Despite their collective knowledge that there is a killer in the house (be it one of them or the ghost of the serial killer who lived in the house), the stupid teenagers keep wandering off by themselves - with predictable results.  As the body count rises, the teens begin to turn on one another and conspire among themselves.  The whole thing gets rather silly in the end, but horror geeks - especially those of us who came of age in the 1980s - should appreciate the spoofy goodness and numerous one-liners this film lays down along the way.  I'm not saying this is a good movie - indeed, some horrors fans will undoubtedly hate it - but it does have guilty pleasure potential for those of us with a particularly twisted sense of humor.  I'll definitely take Stupid Teenagers Must Die! over the umpteenth installment of Scary Movie.",3,Excessive violence. Gratuitous nudity.

1084106,A26TY6GCGBF5HT,B000RW5CAE,Graves,"[1, 3]","From its cover Stupid Teenagers Must Die looks like a comedy parody of 80's slasher flicks on a par with `scary movie.' It is not. What it is an homage to that golden age' of slasher flicks where the writing wonderfully captures the spirit of those films but who's production values are so amazingly non-existent that the film becomes all but unwatchable.Any one who knows the schlock fests that were 1980's slasher flicks knows the set up. Kids, teens or collage age, out for some illicit fun go into a place they shouldn't, often with a `history' of death, where some guy is going to prank them to try and scare the kids and they start dying in gruesome ways that redecorate the set with gore.  The kids are in situations where anyone with two functioning grey cells should know `get out NOW' but being stupid teens bent on proving Darwin right, they don't with predictable results.That is the genre and to some extent the film. The writing seems to accurately recreate not just the lingo of the period but the interests and the fashion, clothes and hair. On paper, this COULD be fun, but unfortunately the delivery fails badly. These films had a low budget, seriously low, laughingly low but Stupid teenagers' takes this to a new low and it destroys the work.The sound quality is not just poor but variable so you wonder `did they fix it?"" only to have it go again. The mikes are too far from the actors too often resulting in you straining to hear what they say. Even worse are the visuals which have a grainy filter over them, I say that in the hope it was intentional, but it makes you want to yell ""wipe off the lens.""Yes the 80's slasher flicks had low budgets and plot lines that sometimes bad you wonder what the writer/director had been drinking and when he'd share it with the audience, but they also understood that visuals were what they could bring to the table, if nothing else. In their delivery the makers of ""Stupid Teenagers'"" forgot this. The writing perfectly captures the mood of the early slasher flicks but the production values are so low as to make the 80's films it emulates look like Avatar by comparison.  With lousy sound not helping this rapidly becomes unwatchable and unintelligible.

1084112,A123E429PKZX9J,B000RW5CAE,Vinnie Oliveri,"[3, 5]","this is a fun and original take on the 80's slasher movie.  it comes in at about 75 minutes, so there's little filler, and though it is working within the constraints of the genre, it finds ways of being inventive so that you don't get the feeling that you've seen this one before.  the production values are atrociously bad, as has been noted by other reviewers, and if that's important to you, avoid this one.  believe it or not, though, this movie's better than the horror-comedy garbage hollywood has been throwing at us, largely because it doesn't take itself so seriously.  if you enjoy b-movies, i think you'll not only enjoy this one, but it'll even surprise you a few times.  (and yes--i've seen the whole thing.)",4,FUN!!!,1217635200,"08 2, 2008",2008,722,"['fun', 'original', 'take', '80', 'slasher', 'movie', '75', 'minutes', 'little', 'filler', 'working', 'constraints', 'genre', 'ways', 'being', 'inventive', 'do', ""n't"", 'get', 'feeling', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'one', 'before', 'production', 'values', 'are', 'atrociously', 'bad', 'been', 'noted', 'other', 'reviewers', 'important', 'avoid', 'one', 'believe', 'not', 'though', 'movie', 'better', 'horror-comedy', 'garbage', 'hollywood', 'been', 'throwing', 'largely', ""n't"", 'take', 'so', 'seriously', 'enjoy', 'b-movies', 'i', 'think', ""'ll"", 'not', 'only', 'enjoy', 'one', ""'ll"", 'even', 'surprise', 'few', 'times', 'yes', 'i', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'whole', 'thing']",Stupid Teenagers Must Die
