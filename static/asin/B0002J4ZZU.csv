This is a story that should be spread to all the schools in the country who are experiencing the collapse of the education infrastructure. It should especially serve as a blueprint to those kids who feel abandoned by the public school system and would rather skip school. What Liz Murray does is so psychologically exceptional, going beyond the biographies of Frederick Douglass and Abraham Lincoln, great men too, who removed their shackles through autodidacticism, i.e. self-direction and self-development, and because of that singularity it should be on every child's book list along with Harry Potter.

But maybe it's what makes HOMELESS TO HARVARD: THE LIZ MURRAY STORY an ideal holiday movie. Ultimately, it inspires and lends hope and perhaps makes you believe in miracles. It'll definitely make you believe in the value of perseverence and great effort. When you start feeling sorry for yourself, think about what Liz Murray went thru. And then get over yourself. This is a true story.Liz Murray, child of extreme poverty, victim of neglect by her drug-addicted parents, at age fifteen became homeless in New York City. HOMELESS TO HARVARD, which first aired in 2003 on the Lifetime channel, is a searing biopic. It pulls absolutely no punches in recounting Liz's harrowing years as she fought to survive on the streets. There are glimmers. Liz, when still with her parents, rarely attended school and all the time felt alienated in class. Didn't help that her classmates made fun of her as the smelly girl. And yet she consistently scored well on the few tests she took. So we're clued in to Liz's innate intelligence and her potential. Her tools for success, while gathering dust, had always been there.It's a terrific cast, with a particular nod to Kelly Lynch, superb and harrowing as Liz's hopelessly addicted mother. Thora Birch is so very good here. She underplays it, and yet she gives you the layers underneath. You're allowed a peek into her character's feelings of desolation and worthlessness and fright. It's devastating stuff. You can't help but cheer when the turning point comes around, when Liz Murray at last decides to pick herself up. So Liz begins to attend high school and to immediately excel. How amazing is it that she graduated in just two freakin' years? She eyes an essay competition sponsored by the New York Times, the prize of which is a paid scholarship to Harvard. Because when Liz Murray finally decided to dream, she dreamed big. It's the only way to do it.This movie is riveting and heartbreaking and, at times, quite hard to watch. And maybe now it'll give you pause when you glance at the homeless, runaway, disenfranchised youths who roam the streets (and maybe it won't). Liz Murray's improbable story demonstrates that one CAN escape the shackles of a nightmarish upbringing. It's not a coincidence that HOMELESS TO HARVARD was part of television programming over the holidays. Yeah, it's fun to observe tradition by watching Santa Claus and elves and flying reindeer. But nothing beats a real miracle story.",4,...Homeless to Harvard - how Liz reached safe harbor...,1356480000,"12 26, 2012",2012,2545,"['are', 'moments', 'movie', 'so', 'rife', 'raw', 'emotional', 'pain', 'hard', 'sit', 'thru', 'maybe', 'what', 'HOMELESS', 'TO', 'HARVARD', 'LIZ', 'MURRAY', 'STORY', 'ideal', 'holiday', 'movie', 'Ultimately', 'hope', 'perhaps', 'believe', 'miracles', ""'ll"", 'definitely', 'make', 'believe', 'value', 'perseverence', 'great', 'effort', 'When', 'start', 'feeling', 'sorry', 'think', 'what', 'Liz', 'Murray', 'went', 'thru', 'then', 'get', 'true', 'story.Liz', 'Murray', 'child', 'extreme', 'poverty', 'victim', 'neglect', 'drug-addicted', 'parents', 'age', 'fifteen', 'became', 'homeless', 'New', 'York', 'City', 'HOMELESS', 'TO', 'HARVARD', 'first', 'aired', '2003', 'Lifetime', 'channel', 'searing', 'biopic', 'absolutely', 'punches', 'recounting', 'Liz', 'harrowing', 'years', 'fought', 'survive', 'streets', 'are', 'glimmers', 'Liz', 'when', 'still', 'parents', 'rarely', 'attended', 'school', 'time', 'felt', 'alienated', 'class', 'Did', ""n't"", 'help', 'classmates', 'made', 'fun', 'smelly', 'girl', 'yet', 'consistently', 'scored', 'well', 'few', 'tests', 'took', ""'re"", 'clued', 'Liz', 'innate', 'intelligence', 'potential', 'tools', 'success', 'gathering', 'dust', 'had', 'always', 'been', 'there.It', 'terrific', 'cast', 'particular', 'nod', 'Kelly', 'Lynch', 'superb', 'harrowing', 'Liz', 'hopelessly', 'addicted', 'mother', 'Thora', 'Birch', 'so', 'very', 'good', 'here', 'yet', 'layers', 'underneath', ""'re"", 'allowed', 'peek', 'character', 'feelings', 'desolation', 'worthlessness', 'fright', 'devastating', 'stuff', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'cheer', 'when', 'turning', 'point', 'around', 'when', 'Liz', 'Murray', 'last', 'decides', 'pick', 'up', 'So', 'Liz', 'begins', 'attend', 'high', 'school', 'immediately', 'excel', 'How', 'amazing', 'graduated', 'just', 'two', 'freakin', 'years', 'eyes', 'essay', 'competition', 'sponsored', 'New', 'York', 'Times', 'prize', 'paid', 'scholarship', 'Harvard', 'when', 'Liz', 'Murray', 'finally', 'decided', 'dream', 'dreamed', 'big', 'only', 'way', 'do', 'it.This', 'movie', 'riveting', 'heartbreaking', 'times', 'quite', 'hard', 'watch', 'maybe', 'now', ""'ll"", 'give', 'pause', 'when', 'glance', 'homeless', 'runaway', 'disenfranchised', 'youths', 'who', 'roam', 'streets', 'wo', ""n't"", 'Liz', 'Murray', 'improbable', 'story', 'one', 'CAN', 'escape', 'shackles', 'nightmarish', 'upbringing', 'not', 'coincidence', 'HOMELESS', 'TO', 'HARVARD', 'was', 'part', 'television', 'programming', 'holidays', 'Yeah', 'fun', 'observe', 'tradition', 'watching', 'Santa', 'Claus', 'elves', 'flying', 'reindeer', 'nothing', 'real', 'miracle', 'story']",N/A

836999,A2AOZQ3WTNVVOK,B0002J4ZZU,"Lonnie E. Holder ""The Review's the Thing""","[5, 8]","The first time my wife watched this movie I passed it by because I usually find these types of movies cheesy.  However, after hearing my wife and daughter both comment on how good the movie was, I decided to give it a chance and convinced them to watch it again.  As it turns out, they both liked it enough that they stayed glued to the television for a second time.Thora Birch (who is already a veteran actor with roles in movies like ""American Beauty,"" ""Alaska,"" and ""Patriot Games"") plays Liz Murray.  Liz and her sister are tossed on a stormy and bizarre sea of life as their parents both have drug abuse problems, and their mother is a schizophrenic as well.  Liz somehow manages to keep it together as their mother Jean (Kelley Lynch) is put into a mental institution, and then returns with the bad news that she has AIDS.  I found the scenes where her mother dies to be poignant without the sort of treacle sweet nonsense that many made-for-tv movies try to use in place of good acting.In most cases a young lady like Liz Murray would have dropped out of school and had issues of her own.  Instead, she fights to get into Harvard, and overcomes the odds to succeed.  Usually I would get into extensive detail about how she does that, but the movie is excellently plotted and paced, so you may learn for yourself how Liz manages to overcome her lack of social skills and poor wardrobe to impress others enough to gain a scholarship.A secondary issue is the veracity of the movie.  I had a couple of long discussions about ""A Beautiful Mind"" with people who had read the book because of the movie's inaccuracies.  However, just as in that movie, I liked this movie because it portrayed someone that conquered life's adversities in a very deliberate fashion, making decisions that bring out a powerful emotional response (in me, anyway).  Just because there are problems with the accuracy of either movie does not lessen the effect of the movie on a viewer.  It is true (as of the writing of this review) that Liz did drop out of Harvard, and now makes a living as an inspirational speaker.  However, while she did not complete Harvard, the fact that she was able to overcome her terrible background to become what she is today should still be an inspiration.Watch the movie for content of the movie and the wonderful job Thora Birch did as Liz Murray.
