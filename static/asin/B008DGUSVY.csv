1550911,A31LHED3SKLWVB,B008DGUSVY,Darren,"[1, 2]","Another rom-com from the GoDigital assembly-line.  I've seen several movies from this VOD (video-on-demand) company, and at least three of them (yes.  THREE.) are almost exactly the same: young screenwriter in L.A. trying to make it big and manage a love-life at the same time.  In each of the films, the writer's agent plays a prominent role (usually as an annoying d-bag).  I'm sincerely hoping that all these films aren't the work of just one writer, writing the same story over and over again until one of them &#34;hits&#34;.  That would be pathetic.  As it is, it's merely sad that a brace of young male screenwriters are apparently having the same exact problems in their lives -- fickle girlfriends, annoying agents -- and are so unimaginative and so lacking in self-awareness that they think the rest of us are interested.  And here's a small point, but it annoys: each of the young screenwriting heroes in these movies are sporting 10-days'-worth of scraggly beard on their jaws.  Hipsters, you may take or leave the following advice from an older, experienced man, but rare is the young woman with the equanimity to deal with your fuzz scratching and tickling her delicate skin.  Shave it off.  Unless you can actually grow a full beard, in which case I've known a few ladies in my time who rather enjoyed the possibilities of properly grown-out fur, so you might be in luck.Yeah, any topic but the movie at hand, right?  By itself, &#34;She Wants Me&#34; is not worth reviewing, except when viewed contextually with the other releases distributed by GoDigital.  But to be entirely fair, what sets this one slightly apart are the appearances of B-List celebs like Charlie Sheen and Hilary Duff, along with legitimate character actors like Debra Jo Rupp and Wayne Knight.  Jonah Hill, Ellen Page, and Kate Bosworth were &#34;considered&#34; for the roles of the screenwriter, his girlfriend, and the big-time celebrity that Duff plays respectively.  (Keep dreaming, fellas!)  Instead, we get someone named Josh Gad and someone named Kristin Ruhlin as the young lovers -- the latter might actually have a future, so keep your eyes peeled.  Something else that sets this one apart: the hero is an overweight shlub instead of a cute kid.  While I had no issue with that, the fact that Mr. Gad seemed unable to breathe through his nose was a serious distraction.  He can't act, either -- his line-readings are, even on the rare occasions when he's audible, riddled with &#34;realistic&#34; pauses between words and phrases.  I finally had to turn the Closed-Captioning on.  I don't particularly relish being unkind, but the truth isn't always mean-spirited.  We're not looking at the next Jack Black here, sorry.It's worth noting that Sheen co-produced, along with providing a cameo.  So what, you say?  Well, it's a harbinger of what the future is going to look like for the majority of films, and that future is coming faster than you might think.  GoDigital has direct deals with iTunes, Netflix, Hulu, YouTube ... and Amazon.com.  Where do you think I've seen these other GoDigitial productions?  Right here on Amazon.  Their corporate history is rather Byzantine in its complexity, but they're on tap to release 108 films after joining with, or buying out, other VOD distributors and film companies.  In other words, the concept of direct-to-streaming is no longer on the cutting-edge fringe of the industry.  It's rapidly becoming the reality, and players -- and yes, Charlie Sheen is a player, believe it or not -- are coming on-board.  Soon you'll start to see people like Clooney and McConaughey attached to these direct streaming releases as producers, followed by the old studio dinosaurs, and then ... well, this is how you'll see your movies in the future.  Bad indie-films like this one will be joined by some good indie films.  And before you know it, the &#34;Dallas Buyers Club&#34; releases of the future will be released directly to Amazon and Netflix as less and less people go to movie houses to watch movies.  Only spectacular extravaganzas that require 3-D goggles will be released in brick-and-mortar theaters, such films being considered the only &#34;worthy&#34; ones to get our fat butts off the couches and to the mall.  I give this process about 10 years, and I'm probably being conservative.Meanwhile, without the risk of wide theater release, badness and lack of originality, as typified by &#34;She Wants Me&#34;, will rule the online roost.  Fasten your seatbelts, it's going to be bumpy night.  1 out of 5.",1,"Like it or hate it, this is the future",1398729600,"04 29, 2014",2014,4546,"['rom-com', 'GoDigital', 'assembly-line', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'several', 'movies', 'VOD', 'video-on-demand', 'company', 'least', 'three', 'yes', 'THREE', 'are', 'almost', 'exactly', 'same', 'young', 'screenwriter', 'L.A.', 'trying', 'make', 'big', 'manage', 'love-life', 'same', 'time', 'films', 'writer', 'agent', 'prominent', 'role', 'usually', 'annoying', 'd-bag', ""'m"", 'sincerely', 'hoping', 'films', 'are', ""n't"", 'work', 'just', 'one', 'writer', 'writing', 'same', 'story', 'over', 'again', 'one', '34', 'hits', '34', 'would', 'be', 'pathetic', 'merely', 'sad', 'brace', 'young', 'male', 'screenwriters', 'are', 'apparently', 'having', 'same', 'exact', 'problems', 'lives', 'fickle', 'girlfriends', 'annoying', 'agents', 'are', 'so', 'unimaginative', 'so', 'lacking', 'self-awareness', 'think', 'rest', 'are', 'interested', 'here', 'small', 'point', 'young', 'screenwriting', 'heroes', 'movies', 'are', 'sporting', ""10-days'-worth"", 'scraggly', 'beard', 'jaws', 'Hipsters', 'may', 'take', 'leave', 'following', 'advice', 'older', 'experienced', 'man', 'rare', 'young', 'woman', 'equanimity', 'deal', 'fuzz', 'scratching', 'tickling', 'delicate', 'skin', 'Shave', 'off', 'can', 'actually', 'grow', 'full', 'beard', 'case', ""'ve"", 'known', 'few', 'ladies', 'time', 'who', 'rather', 'enjoyed', 'possibilities', 'properly', 'grown-out', 'fur', 'might', 'be', 'luck.Yeah', 'topic', 'movie', 'hand', 'right', '34', 'Me', '34', 'not', 'worth', 'reviewing', 'when', 'viewed', 'contextually', 'other', 'releases', 'distributed', 'GoDigital', 'be', 'entirely', 'fair', 'what', 'one', 'slightly', 'apart', 'are', 'appearances', 'B-List', 'celebs', 'Charlie', 'Sheen', 'Hilary', 'Duff', 'legitimate', 'character', 'actors', 'Debra', 'Jo', 'Rupp', 'Wayne', 'Knight', 'Jonah', 'Hill', 'Ellen', 'Page', 'Kate', 'Bosworth', 'were', '34', 'considered', '34', 'roles', 'screenwriter', 'girlfriend', 'big-time', 'celebrity', 'Duff', 'respectively', 'Keep', 'dreaming', 'fellas', 'Instead', 'get', 'someone', 'named', 'Josh', 'Gad', 'someone', 'named', 'Kristin', 'Ruhlin', 'young', 'lovers', 'latter', 'might', 'actually', 'have', 'future', 'so', 'keep', 'eyes', 'peeled', 'Something', 'else', 'one', 'apart', 'hero', 'overweight', 'shlub', 'instead', 'cute', 'kid', 'had', 'issue', 'fact', 'Mr.', 'Gad', 'seemed', 'unable', 'breathe', 'nose', 'was', 'serious', 'distraction', 'ca', ""n't"", 'act', 'line-readings', 'are', 'even', 'rare', 'occasions', 'when', 'audible', 'riddled', '34', 'realistic', '34', 'pauses', 'words', 'phrases', 'finally', 'had', 'turn', 'Closed-Captioning', 'do', ""n't"", 'particularly', 'relish', 'being', 'unkind', 'truth', ""n't"", 'always', 'mean-spirited', ""'re"", 'not', 'looking', 'next', 'Jack', 'Black', 'here', 'sorry.It', 'worth', 'noting', 'Sheen', 'co-produced', 'providing', 'cameo', 'what', 'say', 'Well', 'harbinger', 'what', 'future', 'going', 'look', 'majority', 'films', 'future', 'coming', 'faster', 'might', 'think', 'GoDigital', 'direct', 'deals', 'iTunes', 'Netflix', 'Hulu', 'YouTube', 'Amazon.com', 'Where', 'do', 'think', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'other', 'GoDigitial', 'productions', 'Right', 'here', 'Amazon', 'corporate', 'history', 'rather', 'Byzantine', 'complexity', ""'re"", 'tap', 'release', '108', 'films', 'joining', 'buying', 'out', 'other', 'VOD', 'distributors', 'film', 'companies', 'other', 'words', 'concept', 'direct-to-streaming', 'no', 'longer', 'cutting-edge', 'fringe', 'industry', 'rapidly', 'becoming', 'reality', 'players', 'yes', 'Charlie', 'Sheen', 'player', 'believe', 'not', 'are', 'coming', 'on-board', 'Soon', ""'ll"", 'start', 'see', 'people', 'Clooney', 'McConaughey', 'attached', 'direct', 'streaming', 'producers', 'followed', 'old', 'studio', 'dinosaurs', 'then', 'well', 'how', ""'ll"", 'see', 'movies', 'future', 'Bad', 'indie-films', 'one', 'will', 'be', 'joined', 'good', 'indie', 'films', 'know', '34', 'Dallas', 'Buyers', 'Club', '34', 'releases', 'future', 'will', 'be', 'released', 'directly', 'Amazon', 'Netflix', 'less', 'less', 'people', 'go', 'movie', 'houses', 'watch', 'movies', 'Only', 'spectacular', 'extravaganzas', 'require', '3-D', 'goggles', 'will', 'be', 'released', 'brick-and-mortar', 'theaters', 'such', 'films', 'being', 'considered', 'only', '34', 'worthy', '34', 'ones', 'get', 'fat', 'butts', 'couches', 'mall', 'give', 'process', '10', 'years', ""'m"", 'probably', 'being', 'conservative.Meanwhile', 'risk', 'wide', 'theater', 'release', 'badness', 'lack', 'originality', 'typified', '34', 'Me', '34', 'will', 'rule', 'online', 'roost', 'Fasten', 'seatbelts', 'going', 'be', 'bumpy', 'night', '1', '5']",N/A
