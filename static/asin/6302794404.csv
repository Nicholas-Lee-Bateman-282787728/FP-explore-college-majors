They actually cut Jim Henson, himself, out of a Jim Henson holiday special because of the internal politics of Disney / Jim Henson Company.  Disney, of course, did not wand this 1986 Holiday special released because roughly eight years later Disney released a film with a very similar plot known as Toy Story.One company should make a deal with the other to fully restore this sweet, holiday film to the way it was when Jim Henson first made it, the way he intended it.",1,Sad hack job,1391040000,"01 30, 2014",2014,810,"['sweet', 'beautiful', 'holiday', 'special', 'made', 'Jim', 'Henson', 'unfortunately', 'Disney', 'now', 'rights', 'muppets', 'so', 'nearly', 'three', 'very', 'large', 'scenes', 'where', 'Kermit', 'Frog', 'story', 'even', 'joins', 'singing', 'are', 'cut', 'out', 'film', 'owned', 'Henson', 'Company', 'Muppets', 'are', 'owned', 'Disney.This', 'shameful', 'actually', 'cut', 'Jim', 'Henson', 'Jim', 'Henson', 'holiday', 'special', 'internal', 'politics', 'Disney', '/', 'Jim', 'Henson', 'Company', 'Disney', 'course', 'did', 'not', 'wand', '1986', 'Holiday', 'special', 'released', 'roughly', 'eight', 'years', 'later', 'Disney', 'released', 'film', 'very', 'similar', 'plot', 'known', 'Toy', 'Story.One', 'company', 'should', 'make', 'deal', 'other', 'fully', 'restore', 'sweet', 'holiday', 'film', 'way', 'was', 'when', 'Jim', 'Henson', 'first', 'made', 'way', 'intended']",The Christmas Toy VHS

""The Christmas Toy"" tells of a stuffed tiger named Rugby, one of many toys that come to life when their children aren't around (this a full 10 years before ""Toy Story,"" I should point out). It's Christmas Eve and Rugby, who was Jamie's Christmas present last year, thinks it's time for him to get back into the box and be the center of attention all over again. But there's a new, less cooperative toy already there, waiting to be opened.The special hasn't lost a bit of its charm. It's heartwarming, beautifully made, and full of great music. The only problem is that -- thanks to the fact that the Jim Henson company no longer owns the Muppets -- they had to cut the host segments with Kermit the Frog. It makes the beginning quite abrupt, as if you tuned in after the first commerical break or something.The special is wonderful. The DVD is another story. The transfer is weak -- it looks like it was taken from a well-preserved VHS tape. And there's absolutely nothing in the way of special features, not a scrap.As a fan of this special, I'm ecstatic that it's finally available. People who remember this special, parents looking for something new to show your kids that they've likely never heard of before, this is definitely worth getting. But it just seems they could have put a little more effort into it.",4,"Excellent special, bad DVD",1228608000,"12 7, 2008",2008,1443,"['many', 'years', 'fans', 'begging', 'HiT', 'entertainment', 'finally', 'given', 'DVD', 'one', 'Jim', 'Henson', 'great', 'forgotten', 'specials', 'Christmas', 'Toy', 'tells', 'stuffed', 'tiger', 'named', 'Rugby', 'one', 'many', 'toys', 'come', 'life', 'when', 'children', 'are', ""n't"", 'around', 'full', '10', 'years', 'Toy', 'Story', 'should', 'point', 'out', 'Christmas', 'Eve', 'Rugby', 'who', 'was', 'Jamie', 'Christmas', 'present', 'last', 'year', 'time', 'get', 'back', 'box', 'be', 'center', 'attention', 'over', 'again', 'new', 'less', 'cooperative', 'toy', 'already', 'there', 'waiting', 'be', 'opened.The', 'special', ""n't"", 'lost', 'bit', 'charm', 'heartwarming', 'beautifully', 'made', 'full', 'great', 'music', 'only', 'problem', 'thanks', 'fact', 'Jim', 'Henson', 'company', 'no', 'longer', 'Muppets', 'had', 'cut', 'host', 'segments', 'Kermit', 'Frog', 'beginning', 'quite', 'abrupt', 'tuned', 'first', 'commerical', 'break', 'something.The', 'special', 'wonderful', 'DVD', 'story', 'transfer', 'weak', 'was', 'taken', 'well-preserved', 'VHS', 'tape', 'absolutely', 'nothing', 'way', 'special', 'features', 'not', 'scrap.As', 'fan', 'special', ""'m"", 'ecstatic', 'finally', 'available', 'People', 'who', 'remember', 'special', 'parents', 'looking', 'something', 'new', 'show', 'kids', ""'ve"", 'likely', 'never', 'heard', 'before', 'definitely', 'worth', 'getting', 'just', 'could', 'have', 'put', 'little', 'more', 'effort']",The Christmas Toy VHS

We all remember how much overlap there was between Henson's worlds; Fraggles would appear in Muppet films, Sesame Muppets appeared along side Fraggles and Muppets and this conveyed the most important thing in Henson's world, the family unit, his family was reflected here and what Disney and Hit should know by now, is that one product will support the other; these are old films, just waver the rights and someone take note, the Muppet franchise works at it's best when the Muppet family supports each other. These are old films, just leave them alone ..... by editing this film they have spoilt it, Kermit and the cast end the story in a huge sing song and musically, they have butcher the ending.What made the magic of such Muppet specials is that they were part of the Muppet family and as an audience we were invited in to this family and made to feel apart of it. That was the magic of such work and I find it hard watching this version now, it just doesn't gel well for me. The Christmas Toy was released on to dvd in England as an extra bonus feature along with The Muppet Family Christmas dvd (in 2001 as a Columbria/Tristar release), so the original is out there still, if only second hand.I am not a Henson purist at all and Jim Henson was a man who understood the balance between art and business, however he isn't around now and cutting up these old films spoils something of that creative spirit. I will be careful as to the Henson dvd's I buy in the future, now knowing the legalities which prevent imaginative work enduring intact and live with my childhood memorabilia as it is because that time when Henson's stories ruled the airwaves will not return again with the same level of panache and enlightened idealistic rebelliousness.

I hope to be a teacher and show it to my own students someday around Christmas. My family had a taped copy once, but it was erased, so I was very excited when I found this copy! It's like a visit back to my childhood everytime I watch it now, which is quite a comforting feeling! Very warm and fuzzy!Rugby the tiger is my very favorite, along with Mew, the mouse! Rugby isn't very nice to Mew at first because Mew smells like catnip, which makes Rugby sneeze. Rugby calls him a cat toy, which makes Mew feel sad. But Mew comes in handy when he helps Rugby get to the Christmas tree! Rugby thinks that he will be Jamie's Christmas toy again this year, and doesn't quite understand that there will be a different toy in the box this time. Apple, the doll, along with other memorable characters, come to rescue him from the living room because if he gets seen by humans, he'll be frozen forever. The songs are darling in this movie, especially ""Try the Impossible"", ""Toys love to Play"", and ""Old Frinds, Dear Friends."" My favorite part of this movie is when Rugby sings to Mew and then they give each other a big hug.  Rugby and Mew are very darling characters.

It's extremely charming and also has many catchy songs. If you have children, they MUST watch this!

My sister and I, who are 27 and 30 respectively, think this is the most fun Christmas movie to watch together around the holidays! When our mother taped it off the TV (and we still have that...and every single commercial is for some kind of margarine, which they don't do anymore [that is, run only one product's commercials during a program]) we watched it over a few Christmases and then forgot about it. In high school we rediscovered the tape and thought the story was really stupid and childish...but then, despite ridiculing the idiocy of the stinking mouse ""Mew"" and the wide-eyed vacuousness of ""Apple"" the doll (maybe Gwynnie Paltrow liked this movie too and named her poor daughter after that character...?), we ended up watching it every Christmas since. And of course the busty Meteora, who is as close to a villain as this show has, is particularly worthwhile, with her outrageous ""outer space"" breastplate and diva-esque song. In truth the songs are memorable, like ""Old Friends, New Friends"" and of course, as it's a Muppet production, one would be hard pressed to find even the most jaded Gen-X'er who wouldn't smile at the antics of Jim Henson's creations.
