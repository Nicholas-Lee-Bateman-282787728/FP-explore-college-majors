What he has done to honor and preserve Princess Diana and her legacy is amazing and so tastefully done. Very innovative financially to preserve Althorp Estate for many generations to come.

1644479,AGHYAYJDDIQQU,B00C888NRO,"J. R. Spencer ""J. R.""","[0, 1]","PBS did an outstanding documentary on my family (my father shares the exact first middle and last name of the current Earl of Spencer and brother to the devastatingly beautiful and elegant Princess Diana).For me this is such a gem. Though I have visited England, I have not had the opportunity to visit the family estate of Althorp.  This documentary gives you a great look into the history of the estate and my family.Charles Spencer (the current Earl) has done a brilliant job of renovating the estate, and preserving the amazing collection of art pieces.For those who don't know. The Spencers are one of the lucky aristocratic families of England still able to own their family estate which has been in our family for over 500 years. The current family headed by Charles has done a beautiful job of keeping Princess Diana's memory alive with a beautiful pond and shrine to her memory and digital media presentation of her life and important legacy.  It is wonderful of Charles to allow himself to be interviewed and he does such a loving and elegant presentation of the family.  A must see for Downton Abbey viewers, Anglophiles, and those interested in English aristocracy.Again I'm so proud to be Spencer..  James Ross Spencer II and to see our family crest, coat of arms on Althrop.I wish however that the Earl would have talked a little about the farming of the lands.  There is actually a Spencer Pea (a vegetable) created by my family and the color Spencer green (which runs through parts of the estate. a soft pale green) was not discussed.I loved the info on the Washingtons..  and the link to America!Many of the earliest Spencers in the US came in through Boston and were guests of the Washingtons.. My heritage came in after and settled in the Bahamas owning plantations before moving into Key West and parts of the South.The current Earl and I share a great great ? Uncle John Cornelius Spencer who was knighted by Queen Victoria for his culinary skills. The current chefs at Althrop have made specific dishes served through parts of England. It would have been nice if that was mentioned.However The Secrets of Althrop: Spencers is a must see. !J. R. Spencer is a classical and jazz pianist, recording artist and the author of:Lady Liberty: The Definitive Julie London HandbookandAn Historical Study of Kurt Weill's Der Silbersee: Ein Wintermarchen",5,I'm so proud to be a Spencer!

1644480,A2WJCE8VF3STFW,B00C888NRO,Judith,"[0, 0]","This DVD is just okay, in my opinion.  Too much time is taken to talk about Diana, with nothing new added to her well-known story.  There is also quite a bit of time devoted to the Washington family, I suppose in an effort to appeal to American audiences.  I really wanted to see more of a house tour.  The part about Althorp being a working farm was interesting, and the contributions by the maid and estate workers was very good.  However, if you really want to learn more about Althorp a better choice would be to read Earl Spencer's book Althorp: The Story of a House.  Of course, the books doesn't have the advantage of audio and video, but it really is much more informative, with many pictures and stories about the family and the house.",3,Buy the book instead,1395187200,"03 19, 2014",2014,744,"['DVD', 'just', 'okay', 'opinion', 'Too', 'much', 'time', 'taken', 'talk', 'Diana', 'nothing', 'new', 'added', 'well-known', 'story', 'also', 'quite', 'bit', 'time', 'devoted', 'Washington', 'family', 'suppose', 'effort', 'appeal', 'American', 'audiences', 'really', 'wanted', 'see', 'more', 'house', 'tour', 'part', 'Althorp', 'being', 'working', 'farm', 'was', 'interesting', 'contributions', 'maid', 'estate', 'workers', 'was', 'very', 'good', 'However', 'really', 'want', 'learn', 'more', 'Althorp', 'better', 'choice', 'would', 'be', 'read', 'Earl', 'Spencer', 'book', 'Althorp', 'Story', 'House', 'course', 'books', ""n't"", 'have', 'advantage', 'audio', 'video', 'really', 'much', 'more', 'informative', 'many', 'pictures', 'stories', 'family', 'house']",Secrets of Althorp: Spencers

1644483,A2ZGXQ566SR4FM,B00C888NRO,Patrizia,"[10, 10]","This is a documentary about Althorp.  Most of us know it as the childhood home of Lady Diana and her brother Charles, what most of us don't know is the 500 year history with 19 generations that lived there. I was fascinated to find out that the Spencers had a close relationship with the Washington family (George Washtington) and they too have a place nearby. I also loved Charles in this, he explained he was simply the keeper of this estate for future generations. He came across as almost humble and to see the rooms, hear the history and the family stories was fantastic. I would recommend this highly.. MY only complaint is it appears PBS is doing this as a series (Secrets of Hampton Court WONDERFUL), Secrets of .... (you get the idea) so far I have seen four in this series but I wish they would give it a common name so I can catch it on the DVR when they are on.I also love how they compare how things are done today with how they were done centuries ago. Photos complete these stories as well. There was also times when it looked like the estate wouldn't survive, especially during the war where it was in such bad shape even the historical society wouldn't take it when they tried to give it away because the upkeep became to much. But they managed to keep it and the stunning artifacts intact and now improved.  Althorp is open to the public two months out of the year and that money goes to charity as well.Interviews with Charles, and some of the caretakers and the gamekeeper on the estate are wonderful additions.I would add this to your library. There is some mention of Diana of course, but there is such a rich history in this family it is really informative and so well done.",5,Wonderful and very well done,1373241600,"07 8, 2013",2013,1697,"['documentary', 'Althorp', 'Most', 'know', 'childhood', 'home', 'Lady', 'Diana', 'brother', 'Charles', 'what', 'most', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', '500', 'year', 'history', '19', 'generations', 'lived', 'there', 'was', 'fascinated', 'find', 'out', 'Spencers', 'had', 'close', 'relationship', 'Washington', 'family', 'George', 'Washtington', 'too', 'have', 'place', 'nearby', 'also', 'loved', 'Charles', 'explained', 'was', 'simply', 'keeper', 'estate', 'future', 'generations', 'came', 'across', 'almost', 'humble', 'see', 'rooms', 'hear', 'history', 'family', 'stories', 'was', 'fantastic', 'would', 'recommend', 'highly..', 'MY', 'only', 'complaint', 'PBS', 'doing', 'series', 'Secrets', 'Hampton', 'Court', 'WONDERFUL', 'Secrets', 'get', 'idea', 'far', 'have', 'seen', 'four', 'series', 'wish', 'would', 'give', 'common', 'name', 'so', 'can', 'catch', 'DVR', 'when', 'are', 'on.I', 'also', 'love', 'how', 'compare', 'how', 'things', 'are', 'done', 'today', 'how', 'were', 'done', 'centuries', 'ago', 'Photos', 'complete', 'stories', 'as', 'well', 'was', 'also', 'times', 'when', 'looked', 'estate', 'would', ""n't"", 'survive', 'especially', 'war', 'where', 'was', 'such', 'bad', 'shape', 'even', 'historical', 'society', 'would', ""n't"", 'take', 'when', 'tried', 'give', 'away', 'upkeep', 'became', 'much', 'managed', 'keep', 'stunning', 'artifacts', 'intact', 'now', 'improved', 'Althorp', 'open', 'public', 'two', 'months', 'year', 'money', 'charity', 'well.Interviews', 'Charles', 'caretakers', 'gamekeeper', 'estate', 'are', 'wonderful', 'additions.I', 'would', 'add', 'library', 'mention', 'Diana', 'course', 'such', 'rich', 'history', 'family', 'really', 'informative', 'so', 'well', 'done']",Secrets of Althorp: Spencers
