However, it is very interesting to see Chicago during a rehearsal, with interviews and inserts of concert clips. The list of songs on the back cover is not in order. The correct order is-Wake up sunshine, Dialogue part 1 & 2, Canon, Will you still love me?, Free, Acoustic set medley, Look away, Just you 'N' me, Another rainy day in New York. Total time about 1:11:05. Bonus includes Wall of fame induction. Time about 15:54. And Live! The Thousand Oaks Civic Center. Time about 22:24. Songs includes- Make me smile/medley, Colour my world, Beginnings, 25 or 6 to 4.There is no audio set up. Dvd is Dolby 2.0.

Obviously, Chicago doesn't need to rehearse much to play the same basic concert list of 25 year old songs.  Plus, Chicago is lacking to many original members these days to be the great band they once were.  What the public wants is a great Chicago DVD of an entire concert from the 1970s.  Please note, Chicago has not released an album of original material since approximately 1990.  If this is a video of real artists working, then what are they working on.  Apparently, just to get a paycheck playing all their old songs.",1,Chicago made boring,1082419200,"04 20, 2004",2004,590,"['am', 'big', 'Chicago', 'fan', 'However', 'video/DVD', 'just', 'boring', 'Obviously', 'Chicago', ""n't"", 'need', 'rehearse', 'much', 'play', 'same', 'basic', 'concert', 'list', '25', 'year', 'old', 'songs', 'Chicago', 'lacking', 'many', 'original', 'members', 'days', 'be', 'great', 'band', 'once', 'were', 'What', 'public', 'great', 'Chicago', 'DVD', 'entire', 'concert', '1970s', 'Please', 'note', 'Chicago', 'not', 'released', 'album', 'original', 'material', 'approximately', '1990', 'video', 'real', 'artists', 'working', 'then', 'what', 'are', 'working', 'Apparently', 'just', 'get', 'paycheck', 'playing', 'old', 'songs']",N/A

James,"[10, 12]","If you're a fan of shoddy production, poor sound, and two hosts that are so annoying they are practically ASKING to be strangled to death, then have I got a DVD for you!  This DVD really doesn't offer much, save for a few rehearsal performances of some of Chicago's music, including a delightful revamped version of &quot;Another Rainy Day In New York City&quot;.  Each band member gets interviewed; not particularly insightful.  Also included is some random an ultimately useless footage of the band backstage and preparing to receive a star on the Walk of Fame (wow!).  And if that isn't enough, there is some video of Chicago performing live.  Sadly, this DVD could have been considerably better if the production rate was upped a few notches.  Otherwise what you have here is a pretty unnecessary DVD that only the die-hard Chicago fans would get anything out of...and that's pushing it.",2,"&quot;raw&quot; as in, no post-production work done to this DVD",1066003200,"10 13, 2003",2003,891,"[""'re"", 'fan', 'shoddy', 'production', 'poor', 'sound', 'two', 'hosts', 'are', 'so', 'annoying', 'are', 'practically', 'ASKING', 'be', 'strangled', 'death', 'then', 'have', 'got', 'DVD', 'DVD', 'really', ""n't"", 'offer', 'much', 'save', 'few', 'rehearsal', 'performances', 'Chicago', 'music', 'including', 'delightful', 'revamped', 'version', 'quot', 'Rainy', 'Day', 'New', 'York', 'City', 'quot', 'band', 'member', 'interviewed', 'not', 'particularly', 'insightful', 'Also', 'included', 'random', 'ultimately', 'useless', 'footage', 'band', 'backstage', 'preparing', 'receive', 'star', 'Walk', 'Fame', 'wow', ""n't"", 'enough', 'video', 'Chicago', 'performing', 'live', 'Sadly', 'DVD', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'considerably', 'better', 'production', 'rate', 'was', 'upped', 'few', 'notches', 'Otherwise', 'what', 'have', 'here', 'pretty', 'unnecessary', 'DVD', 'only', 'die-hard', 'Chicago', 'fans', 'would', 'get', 'anything', 'pushing']",N/A

I agree with Pete on his assesment of the hosts -- awful.  The production values are even worse, golly we might need someone who understands recording sound!
