It is listed as ""Widescreen"" and yet when shown in that format, all of the performers are fat and pudgy and look like they have been spread horizonally across the screen.  I have watched the individual videos on my computer and they are perfect, no distortion at all and yet when I show the DVD on my TV, they are distorted.  It is not my TV either.  I have 3 widescreen HD TVs and I get the same results on all of them.  I can play other DVDs such as ""Celtic Woman"" or ""Riverdance"" and they are perfect and when I put on this one, they are all fat.  The only way I can get them to look normal is to change the format ratio on the TV to some other format other than widescreen and then they are the right proportion but the picture is not widescreen.  It really hurts to see all those beautiful dancers with calves on their legs looking like NFL football players.  Mercy, mercy!  Am I doing something wrong, if so will somebody out there help me?  I gave it three stars because of the format issue, the performance was 5 stars all the way.Colonel Follis",3,Pudgy Performers,1373587200,"07 12, 2013",2013,1117,"['something', 'terribly', 'wrong', 'format', 'DVD', 'listed', 'Widescreen', 'yet', 'when', 'shown', 'format', 'performers', 'are', 'fat', 'pudgy', 'look', 'have', 'been', 'spread', 'horizonally', 'screen', 'have', 'watched', 'individual', 'videos', 'computer', 'are', 'perfect', 'distortion', 'yet', 'when', 'show', 'DVD', 'TV', 'are', 'distorted', 'not', 'TV', 'have', '3', 'widescreen', 'HD', 'TVs', 'get', 'same', 'results', 'can', 'play', 'other', 'DVDs', 'such', 'Celtic', 'Woman', 'Riverdance', 'are', 'perfect', 'when', 'put', 'one', 'are', 'fat', 'only', 'way', 'can', 'get', 'look', 'normal', 'change', 'format', 'ratio', 'TV', 'other', 'format', 'other', 'widescreen', 'then', 'are', 'right', 'proportion', 'picture', 'not', 'widescreen', 'really', 'see', 'beautiful', 'dancers', 'calves', 'legs', 'looking', 'NFL', 'football', 'players', 'Mercy', 'mercy', 'Am', 'doing', 'something', 'wrong', 'so', 'will', 'somebody', 'out', 'there', 'help', 'gave', 'three', 'stars', 'format', 'issue', 'performance', 'was', '5', 'stars', 'way.Colonel', 'Follis']",N/A

The taping is better but the show looks sooo tacky at points it was laughable. I'm not apurist I love the show and I have been an Irish dancer for about 15 years. At one point the gypsy girl comes out in this god awful red cat suit looking like some villinous from the 1960's Batman TV series..very tacky. And Dair Nolan looked like he hated wearing that ridculous cape! As a dancer what idiot would want to dance with a cape flapping about your body? I do prefer this tape to the Orginal LOTD but I still think Flatley needs to work on his costume ideas.

For those unfamiliar, the Feet of Flames dvd is a recording of Michael Flatley's final performace as the ""Lord of the Dance.""  This production is basically Lord of the Dance with a few new bells and whistles as well as an occasional surpise compared to its predecessor.There are several Irish dance shows out there now but few can even be in the same room as Feet of Flames.  Combining Lord of the Dance troupes 1 and 2, this performance is incredibly large.  It also features the first official video recording of Flatley on the flute.  One of his finale numbers, also called ""Feet of Flames,"" shows the world the incredible foot speed and talent of its headliner.Lastly, it was unique to see how the lead performers had ""grown"" from the few years of touring compared to their unsure and stoic expressions off the Lord of the Dance video.

452037,A2ZNJKY01ANDHG,630516603X,"John A. Kuczma ""RogueUlfric""","[58, 58]","It appears that, at least for the moment, Michael Flatley has found a niche that he is comfortable with and that he intends to carve ever deeper.  He accomplishes that purpose handsomely with Feet of Flames.Much of  the material in this show is taken directly from Lord of the Dance, but  there are a number of impressive additions, including a spectacular combat  dancing sequence near the end.  Feet of Flames maintains the Celtic slant  established by its predecessor and is powerfully performed by a dynamic  group of dancers, spearheaded by Flatley's magnificent work.The video  itself is far superior to Lord of the Dance in that the constant cut-aways  and angle changes have been largely done away with.  The production quality  is superb and the music breathtaking, particularly in surround sound or  with a sub-woofer.As with Lord of the Dance, there is a raw, sensual  feel to Feet of Flames that adds to the inherent excitement of Irish Dance.  Flatley's flamboyant interpretations and variations on classic moves add  to the visual impact.From start to finish, this is an outstanding  entertainment event.",5,An entertaining embellishment of Lord of the Dance,945216000,"12 15, 1999",1999,1118,"['least', 'moment', 'Michael', 'Flatley', 'found', 'niche', 'comfortable', 'carve', 'ever', 'deeper', 'purpose', 'handsomely', 'Feet', 'Flames.Much', 'material', 'show', 'taken', 'directly', 'Lord', 'Dance', 'are', 'number', 'impressive', 'additions', 'including', 'spectacular', 'combat', 'dancing', 'sequence', 'end', 'Feet', 'Flames', 'Celtic', 'slant', 'established', 'predecessor', 'powerfully', 'performed', 'dynamic', 'group', 'dancers', 'spearheaded', 'Flatley', 'magnificent', 'work.The', 'video', 'far', 'superior', 'Lord', 'Dance', 'constant', 'cut-aways', 'angle', 'changes', 'have', 'been', 'largely', 'done', 'away', 'production', 'quality', 'superb', 'music', 'breathtaking', 'particularly', 'surround', 'sound', 'sub-woofer.As', 'Lord', 'Dance', 'raw', 'sensual', 'feel', 'Feet', 'Flames', 'inherent', 'excitement', 'Irish', 'Dance', 'Flatley', 'flamboyant', 'interpretations', 'variations', 'classic', 'moves', 'add', 'visual', 'impact.From', 'start', 'finish', 'outstanding', 'entertainment', 'event']",N/A
452038,AQ7V1UO19U1N9,630516603X,John Rossi,"[53, 55]","I'll try my best to do this production as much justice as I can. This performance, titled &quot;Feet Of Flames&quot;  is billed as Michael Flatley's last performance in the role of the &quot;Lord Of The Dance&quot; and I think he does an excellent job here! It is a fitting send-off, very grand and epic in scope and scale. I did get to see the original Lord Of The Dance show live on stage in Philadelphia in 1997 and was totally blown away by the experience. The dancing, the beautiful music and the celestial and haunting singing of Anne Buckley remain in my heart to this very day. There is just something about hearing that music live and feeling the vibrations course through your body with every step the dancers make. It gives new meaning to the saying that you just HAVE to be there. There is NOTHING like the energy of a live stage dancing performance. Particularly not one like this one, with sure fire and energy and passion.Do not be fooled into thinking that is is just  an out-of doors version of the original Lord Of The Dance show. It IS in a sense, and yet in many ways it is not. This show takes the original Lord Of The Dance production and kicks it into high gear. All of the original music and dances are back, but the dance routines look different a bit and more elaborate. They are longer and feature quite a bitof  more complicated step work and more character interaction. There are also many new dances and more original musical pieces that make this a totally new experience.I loved the fact that Bernadette Flynn (the &quot;good&quot; girl in the show) got to do her own solo dance in the middle of this. It really gave her a chance to shine. The new numbers played by the dueling violinists were lively and lovely at the same time. The costumes and sets for this show were much bigger and elaborate than those for the original show. I would EASILY say that for me, the combination of old music and new numbers with more elaborate and totally new dance sequences was wonderful to watch. It made certain that I did not feel I was watching &quot;the same old show&quot; done over again. There were just so many new things to see and to hear and to take in. I loved Michael Flatley's solo flute performance near the beginning of act two. Very lovely stuff. I must say though that for me the highlight was another chance to hear Anne Buckley sing. What a GOLDEN voice. So beautiful and tender, yet rich and deep and passionate. The three songs she did here were even better to me than the ones she sang in the original Lord Of The Dance show. Her version of &quot;Marble Halls&quot; to me was even better than Enya's rendition, which I had previously loved. Ms. Buckley  introduced me to the haunting love ballad &quot;Carrickfergus&quot; that had me reaching for my Kleenex even as I was wide-eyed and smiling from ear to ear. And the Gaelic piece she did (An Maigdean Mhara, if my memory serves correctly) was so beautiful that mere seconds after Ms. Buckley began to sing this number, my floodgates FLEW open and did not close for the full 3+ minutes of this song. Also I loved the fact that in this show instead of having just the green hooded cape for all three of her numbers, this time Anne got to wear three diffferent and very beautiful dresses, one for each song that she did (green, white, and gold). Exquisite costumes to fit with a stunning voice and an incredible beauty with great stage prescence. I for one cannot wait for her solo debut album.In short, this was an unforgettable experience. I have loved Celtic music and dance for years now and this performance only made my fires burn all the hotter with enthusiasm. The music, the dancing, the lighting, the story of a noble warrior saving his land from a dark knight's conquest...they combined to take my breath away and give me one of the greatest entertainment experiences of my life. If you get to see this I hope you get to enjoy it and even love it as much as I did. I still love this show today, more than two years after I got to see it, and I know I always will.

But working in a store that sold this, I was absolutely floored by how awesome Michael Flatly's Feet of Flames was.  This can not be compared to River Dance or Lord of the Dance (precurors to Feet of Flames).  This is much more a show; kind of like the difference between Cirque Du Soleil's Saltimbanco and Quidam.  The production value skyrockets and makes anything else (before it) look archaic.Feet of Flames showcases MORE than just Celtic-style dancing.  There are musical numbers by both a female duo and a solo singer.  There IS some sort of story involved but I never focused too much on it.  The dancing is fantastic.  While the show is geared around Michael Flatly's skills, he does allow his other dancers to have some of the spotlight.The interviews/making-of is quite insightful.
