Somewhat disappointed at the absence of the original heart-throb in the 1st 2 installments - sheesh what eye-candy she is.  But when it comes to pure enjoyment this hit the spot for me and the Amazon price for the complete 3 movie set was a deciding factor in my purchase.

1278203,ADF1UM71XCZGK,B002MIK0US,Hazel,"[2, 2]","I bought this set at WalMart then went back the next day to get the 3rd movie. This set comes with 2 of the best editions of the first 2 films. Excellent movies backed up by great special features. Don't listen to the critics or the haters. The CG animations are perfect. Acting and entertainment is top notch. The only down side is the story is pretty generic. ""The Chosen One"" story can only be used So many times without becoming pointless. But these movies are PURE entertainment and worth any collection, unless your one of those nit picky people who don't appreciate all forms of film.
