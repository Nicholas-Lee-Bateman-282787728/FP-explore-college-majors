It is really the only sit-com that I can think of that I really truly enjoyed enough to watch every week.Then, with syndication in the mid to late 90's I got to watch it all over again.Well, now they have finally come to their senses and have started releasing the show on DVD. All I can say is it's about time. This was the funniest show of the 90's and it is my personal favorite sit-com of all time.It just doesn't get any better. The characters are great; Joe, the anal and overly sensitive older brother; Brian, the flyboy (literally and figuratively); Helen, the quick-witted, smart-mouthed, lifelong friend; Fay, the (somewhat disfunctional) mother figure to everyone; Roy, the competition, a pain in the butt, but still always around causing trouble; and my personal favorites, Lowell and Antonio, Lowell being the village idiot that's good with a wrench but bad with everything else, and Antonio, the Italian cabby with a heart of gold but a long-fuse and a sarcastic, cynical outlook.I LOVE THIS SHOW.

I have the first three seasons and enjoy watching them.  However, the picture is not very sharp or clear.  I've got DVDs of movies made in the 70s that are better than this. And most disappointing of all, Disk 4 of the third season won't even play.  My DVD player doesn't even recognize a disk being in the tray. I've cleaned the disk and checked the player. Player works fine with all other disks. Unfortunately I discovered that after the return period was expired. I doubt that I will buy anymore even though I loved the show.

Actually, it wasn't as funny as most, but the acting was so superb, the lack of raucous humor was ok because we fell in love with the cast that were meticulously placed together and who created such warm, endearing characters, that it made the sometimes not so brilliant scripts shine.
