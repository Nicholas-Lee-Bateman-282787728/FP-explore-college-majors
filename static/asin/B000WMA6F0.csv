She is an atrocious actress, too short and stubby to be cute or interesting, and her english is not mature enough to be believable as a ""business-woman.""  Not to mention the fact that she wears skin-tight ripped jeans in most of the movie.  I LOVE Christmas movies, but this one is a REAL STINKER!don't waste your time.  Lifetime and Hallmark both have some great Christmas movies, this one does not make my repeat-viewing list....I urge Hollywood, do not hire that actress again, MAYBE as a some sort of carnival-dwarf or an extra at a fat-camp.oh, there is a scene with really strange singing in the warehouse and they are dancing around with their carts, for 'camp-value,' it is worth buying the dvd and posting it on the internet!

Schmidt,"[22, 22]","Maybe I have bad taste or something, but I actually enjoyed this movie (albeit, only as a guilty pleasure), and was surprised to see all the one-star reviews.  This is your typical made-for-tv / lifetime-original-movie fare, and if you go into it knowing what to expect, it's an enjoyable ride.  Sure, it's corny, patronizing, and full of hammy acting from no-name actors, but it's a sweet and simple movie that captures the spirit of the season pretty well...and that's what I expect from this type of feature.

1110280,A2HVL790PBWYTU,B000WMA6F0,"H. Bala ""Me Too Can Read""","[0, 0]","I don't know which barren landscape I'd least want to get stranded in: the Gobi desert or the Lifetime channel. Given, maybe I'd just had the most awful luck in that each time I flipped to Lifetime, there'd be crap on my telly. Seems to me, for every good programming likeAn Amish Murder(2013) orStill Small Voices(2007), there'd be ten specimens of awfulness like All She Wants for Christmas (2006).Er, here's the plot of it: In Forest City, a town of which survival depends primarily on the local Christmas decorations factory, the city limits marker boasts that ""We're Merry All Year Long."" It's one of those communities that were it to exist in real life may come off as kinda creepy; it seems so fixated on Christmas (although, a rebuttal may be that this story does take place around the holidays; maybe, the rest of the time, they're as grouchy and mean-spirited as you and me). But it's stopped snowing in Forest City years ago. Maybe that's an omen, maybe it's just global warming.My uh-oh radar activated when the central character, Judith Ann Dunn (Monica Keena), remarks that everyone calls her ""Noelle"" because she was born in December. That just smacked of trying too hard to be cute. Noelle is a practical girl. She's into progress and the bottom line. She's an economics whiz who's raring to take Wall Street by storm. But she thinks she can pad her resume some if only she can figure out a way for the Aikens Christmas Decorations Co. to regain solvency. It'll be tough since the old founder, him what just passed away, had been subsidizing the company's losses with money from his personal account.But how does that mysterious drifter (Tobias Mehler) what just drove into town - and immediately had Noelle's giant snowman balloon collapse on him - figure into things? He gets a temp gig as a seasonal employee at Aiken's. And check him out getting all chummy with the founder's foxy granddaughter (Sonya Salomaa) who's just pulled into town to assess the company. It doesn't take a veteran of television programming to identify all the clich&eacute;d plot points.If you haven't figured things out yet by the first two commercial breaks, honestly, I'm judging you. There's a big reveal mid-film that's anything but. The one thing that did make me go ""Huh, how about that?"" was how the impending mega-store incursion would figure into it. Global Mart threatens the town's small businesses. Half of the community is up in arms, the rest are scrambling to show their support of Global Mart (and hoping to nail some jobs). My favorite character is neither the whiz accountant or the mysterious drifter. I thought Nelson Wong's crusty Kenny the diner owner stole every scene he was in. My biggest problem isn't the triteness or the obviousness of the plot or the uninspired dialogue. It's the performances of the two leads. Keena and Mehler show minimum spark and demonstrate the least natural acting performances. Mehler just seems to float thru his lines. Monica Keena, I don't what it is about her. Maybe it's that she giggles too much. It's awkward. It's contrived. And that dart throwing at the dollar bar is plenty ridiculous. 2.5 out of 5 stars for this one. Boy, Lifetime's got me grumpy today. I'll be needing my special eggnog.",3,"...All She Wants for Christmas is to not ever do a Lifetime movie again, like ever...",1386547200,"12 9, 2013",2013,3249,"['do', ""n't"", 'know', 'barren', 'landscape', ""'d"", 'least', 'want', 'get', 'stranded', 'Gobi', 'desert', 'Lifetime', 'channel', 'Given', 'maybe', ""'d"", 'just', 'had', 'most', 'awful', 'luck', 'time', 'flipped', 'Lifetime', ""'d"", 'be', 'crap', 'telly', 'Seems', 'good', 'programming', 'likeAn', 'Amish', 'Murder', '2013', 'orStill', 'Small', 'Voices', '2007', ""'d"", 'be', 'ten', 'specimens', 'awfulness', 'Christmas', '2006', '.Er', 'here', 'plot', 'Forest', 'City', 'town', 'survival', 'primarily', 'local', 'Christmas', 'decorations', 'factory', 'city', 'marker', ""'re"", 'Merry', 'Year', 'Long', 'one', 'communities', 'were', 'exist', 'real', 'life', 'may', 'come', 'off', 'kinda', 'creepy', 'so', 'fixated', 'Christmas', 'rebuttal', 'may', 'be', 'story', 'take', 'place', 'holidays', 'maybe', 'rest', 'time', ""'re"", 'grouchy', 'mean-spirited', 'stopped', 'snowing', 'Forest', 'City', 'years', 'ago', 'Maybe', 'omen', 'maybe', 'just', 'global', 'warming.My', 'uh-oh', 'radar', 'activated', 'when', 'central', 'character', 'Judith', 'Ann', 'Dunn', 'Monica', 'Keena', 'remarks', 'everyone', 'Noelle', 'was', 'born', 'December', 'just', 'smacked', 'trying', 'too', 'hard', 'be', 'cute', 'Noelle', 'practical', 'girl', 'progress', 'bottom', 'line', 'economics', 'whiz', 'who', 'raring', 'take', 'Wall', 'Street', 'storm', 'can', 'pad', 'resume', 'only', 'can', 'figure', 'out', 'way', 'Aikens', 'Christmas', 'Decorations', 'Co.', 'regain', 'solvency', ""'ll"", 'be', 'tough', 'old', 'founder', 'what', 'just', 'passed', 'away', 'had', 'been', 'subsidizing', 'company', 'losses', 'money', 'personal', 'account.But', 'how', 'mysterious', 'drifter', 'Tobias', 'Mehler', 'what', 'just', 'drove', 'town', 'immediately', 'had', 'Noelle', 'giant', 'snowman', 'balloon', 'collapse', 'figure', 'things', 'temp', 'gig', 'seasonal', 'employee', 'Aiken', 'check', 'out', 'getting', 'chummy', 'founder', 'foxy', 'granddaughter', 'Sonya', 'Salomaa', 'who', 'just', 'pulled', 'town', 'assess', 'company', ""n't"", 'take', 'veteran', 'television', 'programming', 'identify', 'clich', 'eacute', 'plot', 'points.If', 'have', ""n't"", 'figured', 'things', 'out', 'yet', 'first', 'two', 'commercial', 'breaks', 'honestly', ""'m"", 'judging', 'big', 'reveal', 'mid-film', 'anything', 'one', 'thing', 'did', 'make', 'go', 'Huh', 'how', 'was', 'how', 'impending', 'mega-store', 'incursion', 'would', 'figure', 'Global', 'Mart', 'town', 'small', 'businesses', 'Half', 'community', 'up', 'arms', 'rest', 'are', 'scrambling', 'show', 'support', 'Global', 'Mart', 'hoping', 'nail', 'jobs', 'favorite', 'character', 'whiz', 'accountant', 'mysterious', 'drifter', 'thought', 'Nelson', 'Wong', 'crusty', 'Kenny', 'diner', 'owner', 'stole', 'scene', 'was', 'biggest', 'problem', ""n't"", 'triteness', 'obviousness', 'plot', 'uninspired', 'dialogue', 'performances', 'two', 'leads', 'Keena', 'Mehler', 'show', 'minimum', 'spark', 'demonstrate', 'least', 'natural', 'acting', 'performances', 'Mehler', 'just', 'float', 'thru', 'lines', 'Monica', 'Keena', 'do', ""n't"", 'what', 'Maybe', 'too', 'much', 'awkward', 'contrived', 'dart', 'throwing', 'dollar', 'bar', 'plenty', 'ridiculous', '2.5', '5', 'stars', 'one', 'Boy', 'Lifetime', 'got', 'grumpy', 'today', ""'ll"", 'be', 'needing', 'special', 'eggnog']",All She Wants For Christmas
