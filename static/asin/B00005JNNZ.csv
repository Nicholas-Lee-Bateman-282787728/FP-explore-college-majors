In 1999 Ken Carter, who held school basketball records from his attendance there, takes a barely paid coaching position. This movie is based on that true story.The story moves quickly, beginning with Ken Carter watching his son's basketball game and afterward talks to the coach of the Richmond team about taking the job. The plot is well known, so I will tell you why I liked this movie besides the real life drama.Samuel Jackson is a wonderful actor and this has been regarded as one of his best performances. He conveys emotion well without being flamboyant, and he acts like a real coach. No boy on the team stands out as being a superstar or morally superior - Coach Carter's son plays on the team but is not favored or given more screen time. The plot doesn't lag and even though the movie is 136 minutes, you don't get bored.I highly recommend renting or buying this movie.",5,Wonder Coach,1184025600,"07 10, 2007",2007,1000,"['Richmond', 'High', 'CA', 'only', '50', '%', 'students', 'will', 'graduate', 'students', 'are', '80', '%', 'more', 'likely', 'go', 'prison', 'college', '1999', 'Ken', 'Carter', 'who', 'held', 'school', 'basketball', 'records', 'attendance', 'there', 'barely', 'paid', 'coaching', 'position', 'movie', 'based', 'true', 'story.The', 'story', 'moves', 'quickly', 'beginning', 'Ken', 'Carter', 'watching', 'son', 'basketball', 'game', 'afterward', 'talks', 'coach', 'Richmond', 'team', 'taking', 'job', 'plot', 'well', 'known', 'will', 'tell', 'why', 'liked', 'movie', 'real', 'life', 'drama.Samuel', 'Jackson', 'wonderful', 'actor', 'been', 'regarded', 'one', 'best', 'performances', 'emotion', 'well', 'being', 'flamboyant', 'real', 'coach', 'boy', 'team', 'out', 'being', 'superstar', 'morally', 'superior', 'Coach', 'Carter', 'son', 'team', 'not', 'favored', 'given', 'more', 'screen', 'time', 'plot', ""n't"", 'lag', 'even', 'movie', '136', 'minutes', 'do', ""n't"", 'get', 'bored.I', 'highly', 'recommend', 'renting', 'buying', 'movie']",N/A

The movie moved along quickly and kept even non-sports fans interested. Yes, this movie is about basketball, but it's also about inner-city teens and their relationship with their coach and their neighborhood. All of the characters did a great job. Each teen seemed to have their own separate story besides the games. The only complaint I have is the side plot of Keira and Kenya. They keep talking about her being pregnant and it's obvious she's not. Especially at the end of the movie, when she should have been pretty big and Kenya acts like he doesn't know that she's not pregnant anymore. It was pretty weak. Other than that though great movie. I would say this ranked right up their with Remember  the titans. This would be a great family movie too if it had a little less violence and profanity.

What are the odds?Ken Carter rides his gleaming Mercedes into the stereotypical ghetto of MTV films and teaches a basketball team how to win games, become scholars, and quit acting like a bunch of damn hoodlums. ""Based on a true story."" One of these ghetto school movies comes along about every five years, and they're always based on a true story, and they always end with ""Thank you, teacher, for saving me from myself.""Okay, that was kind of cruel. Not wrong, though. This incarnation of our savior is Samuel L. Jackson, who I have much respect for. Shaved head, voice like John Amos, eyes like Mike Singletary. So far so good. John Amos is also a fine actor, and I bet some NFLers still have nightmares about Mike Singletary's eyes.Rob Brown, who debuted in FINDING FORRESTER as an intelligent, good-hearted high school basketball player stuck in a bad neighborhood, returns as an intelligent, good-hearted high school basketball player stuck in a bad neighborhood. Hey, play to your strengths. He also gets his girlfriend pregnant. Oops. Slam dunk, baby!If kids grow up watching and emulating these stereotypes, at what point does portraying a stereotype become portraying realism? I don't know, but this movie certainly wanders into that territory. A token white guy, a token Hispanic, a token Asian, no decent parts for the ladies, many MTV moments and an urban contemporary soundtrack I bet the rappers fought to be a part of. But hey, if that's what everybody's watching anyway, why not make a movie like that with a message worth hearing?This is a feel-good story that offers no surprises. You can see the ending, more or less, coming two hours away. Further proof that Hollywood doesn't do subtle.

Because he puts his ideals above simply winning, he creates a lot of conflict within the team, the school and the surrounding community.In the end the coaches beliefs are able to sway opinion and his behavior becomes a standard for which to strive.

Coach Carter features Samuel L. Jackson following the real-life story of Ken Carter, who took on the job of head basketball coach at Richmond High School (in California, not Virginia). He soon discovers that the kids on the team are pretty ghetto, to say the least, but that doesn't stop him from trying to whip the kids into shape by issuing basketball contracts that he expects them to live up to if they want to play on the team. I won't go into the details of the contract because most of the other reviewers already did that, but what I WILL say is that some people won't believe the consequences that occur after all the students don't live up to the guidelines of the contract.The movie's subplot is pretty interesting, too: one of the boys on the team, Kenyon Stone (played by Rob Brown, which I believe is his first big role since the overlooked Finding Forrester), is rationally trying to figure out how he's going to play basketball and go to college when he has a baby coming with his girlfriend Kyra (played by Ashanti, who actually does a good job in her role; as does former 3LW lead singer Adrienne Bailon, who still looks SEXXXY...*clears throat*). Anyway, this storyline may look played-out on paper, but it's a lot more interesting than it sounds, especially what happens at the end.It was also interesting to see Ken Carter's son Damien (Robert Ri'chard) transfer to Richmond High and join the basketball team as a freshman, and his having to serve the same consequences that every other team member had to. I was kind of hoping that there would be some scenes depicting the Carters at home and Damien complaining about how harsh the daily practice exercises were. Oh well, Coach Carter is still a truly extraordinary movie.

632654,A2QA095LQPDBJD,B00005JNNZ,Ariel Escasa,"[1, 1]","We've seen this sort of thing before. An undisciplined, underachieving team is taken over by a tough, no-nonsense coach who turns them into winners. Gene Hackman did his turn as the coach in Hoosiers. Heck, even Goldie Hawn (Wildcats) and Cathy Lee Crosby (Coach) played the pivotal mentor role, which just goes to show that Hollywood will do anything, including crossing gender boundaries, to cash in on the coach-turns-losers-into-winners storyline.But Coach Carter manages to rise above the cliche. There are several reasons for this, the first and most obvious being Samuel L. Jackson's gritty performance as the title character. Jackson, a man of enormous talent but unfortunately not known for being very selective with his roles, made a good decision with this one. In a resume that covers a range of movies from the outright disastrous to the so-so to the pretty good to the very good, his work in this movie certainly ranks among his finest performances.A close second reason this movie works in spite of its formula storyline is the fact that it's based on a true story. The same can be said for Hoosiers, but what sets Coach Carter apart is the fact that Carter demanded that his players be not just good athletes, but also good role models. Your typical sports movie is usually just about the sport, about the winning attitude, what makes champions, etc. Carter's definition of a champion was not limited to on-court performance. He took the concept a step further, requiring his players to follow a dress code, maintain good grades, and observe proper behavior off the court.Now, on the down side: I don't know how accurate the depiction of Carter's drill sergeant tactics was, but I do know that having high school students do 500 pushups is utterly ridiculous. A typical healthy human body can barely do 100. Also, can someone please explain how one man (Carter's assistant, Clyde) can keep count of eight or nine players' pushups and suicides? (This is during the scene where the players help Timo Cruz get back into the team by doing these exercises for him.) In another scene, Carter interrupts a teacher in mid-lecture -- in mid-sentence in fact -- to ask about one of his players who's supposed to be in that class. I used to be a teacher, and I know that whether you're a fellow-teacher, a coach, or even the principal, you do not walk into a classroom (or a laboratory, as in this scene) and interrupt a teacher while he/she is talking to his/her students. Not even with a polite ""excuse me."" Then there's the scene in the final seconds of the game against St. Francis. The ball is inbounded, and the clock is ticking while it's still in the air. The time shouldn't run until it touches a player. Another poster here also pointed out that some people in the gallery were smiling during these final tense seconds, a completely unnatural behavior under those circumstances. I agree with him.Still, in spite of these flaws, Coach Carter delivers. Proof that even a by-the-numbers story, when well-told, can work.Oh, there's one other reason this film rises above the cliche, and that's the way it ends. I won't give away any more than that. If you haven't seen this film, I urge you to give it a shot. You don't even have to be a sports fan to appreciate it, because this isn't just about sports. It's about being a winner, both on and off the court.",4,Rises Above the Cliche,1153526400,"07 22, 2006",2006,3369,"[""'ve"", 'seen', 'sort', 'thing', 'undisciplined', 'underachieving', 'team', 'taken', 'over', 'tough', 'no-nonsense', 'coach', 'who', 'winners', 'Gene', 'Hackman', 'did', 'turn', 'coach', 'Hoosiers', 'Heck', 'even', 'Goldie', 'Hawn', 'Wildcats', 'Cathy', 'Lee', 'Crosby', 'Coach', 'played', 'pivotal', 'mentor', 'role', 'just', 'show', 'Hollywood', 'will', 'do', 'anything', 'including', 'crossing', 'gender', 'boundaries', 'cash', 'coach-turns-losers-into-winners', 'storyline.But', 'Coach', 'Carter', 'rise', 'cliche', 'are', 'several', 'reasons', 'first', 'most', 'obvious', 'being', 'Samuel', 'L.', 'Jackson', 'gritty', 'performance', 'title', 'character', 'Jackson', 'man', 'enormous', 'talent', 'unfortunately', 'not', 'known', 'being', 'very', 'selective', 'roles', 'made', 'good', 'decision', 'one', 'resume', 'range', 'movies', 'outright', 'disastrous', 'so-so', 'pretty', 'good', 'very', 'good', 'work', 'movie', 'certainly', 'finest', 'performances.A', 'close', 'second', 'reason', 'movie', 'spite', 'formula', 'storyline', 'fact', 'based', 'true', 'story', 'same', 'can', 'be', 'said', 'Hoosiers', 'what', 'Coach', 'Carter', 'apart', 'fact', 'Carter', 'demanded', 'players', 'be', 'not', 'just', 'good', 'athletes', 'also', 'good', 'role', 'models', 'typical', 'sports', 'movie', 'usually', 'just', 'sport', 'winning', 'attitude', 'what', 'champions', 'etc', 'Carter', 'definition', 'champion', 'was', 'not', 'limited', 'on-court', 'performance', 'took', 'concept', 'step', 'further', 'requiring', 'players', 'follow', 'dress', 'code', 'maintain', 'good', 'grades', 'observe', 'proper', 'behavior', 'court.Now', 'down', 'side', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'how', 'accurate', 'depiction', 'Carter', 'drill', 'sergeant', 'tactics', 'was', 'do', 'know', 'having', 'high', 'school', 'students', 'do', '500', 'pushups', 'utterly', 'ridiculous', 'typical', 'healthy', 'human', 'body', 'can', 'barely', 'do', '100', 'Also', 'can', 'someone', 'please', 'explain', 'how', 'one', 'man', 'Carter', 'assistant', 'Clyde', 'can', 'keep', 'count', 'eight', 'nine', 'players', 'pushups', 'suicides', 'scene', 'where', 'players', 'help', 'Timo', 'Cruz', 'get', 'back', 'team', 'doing', 'exercises', 'scene', 'Carter', 'teacher', 'mid-lecture', 'mid-sentence', 'fact', 'ask', 'one', 'players', 'who', 'supposed', 'be', 'class', 'used', 'be', 'teacher', 'know', ""'re"", 'fellow-teacher', 'coach', 'even', 'principal', 'do', 'not', 'walk', 'classroom', 'laboratory', 'scene', 'interrupt', 'teacher', 'he/she', 'talking', 'students', 'Not', 'even', 'polite', 'Then', 'scene', 'final', 'seconds', 'game', 'St.', 'Francis', 'ball', 'inbounded', 'clock', 'ticking', 'still', 'air', 'time', 'should', ""n't"", 'run', 'player', 'poster', 'here', 'also', 'pointed', 'out', 'people', 'gallery', 'were', 'smiling', 'final', 'tense', 'seconds', 'completely', 'unnatural', 'behavior', 'circumstances', 'agree', 'him.Still', 'spite', 'flaws', 'Coach', 'Carter', 'delivers', 'Proof', 'even', 'by-the-numbers', 'story', 'when', 'well-told', 'can', 'work.Oh', 'one', 'other', 'reason', 'film', 'cliche', 'way', 'wo', ""n't"", 'give', 'away', 'more', 'have', ""n't"", 'seen', 'film', 'urge', 'give', 'shot', 'do', ""n't"", 'even', 'have', 'be', 'sports', 'fan', 'appreciate', ""n't"", 'just', 'sports', 'being', 'winner', 'court']",N/A
632655,A1PASRZ81DY9C,B00005JNNZ,Austin Somlo,"[2, 3]","Viewed: 10/08Rate: 610/08: Although Coach Carter raises a lot of good points, it also invites several bad points as well. Samuel Jackson was good in his role, and he ought to do more of the same type of work because lately he has been doing crap. Outside of him, the cast was very good turning in surprisingly well-played performances. I find the plot behind Coach Carter to be all too familiar, ringing the feeling of ""been there, done it before."" One thing I hadn't really expected in Coach Carter is how far the discipline went. So, it was a warm welcome for me, and I enjoyed that very much. Moreover, I liked the fact that Coach Carter stresses the idea of ""teamwork"" as well as it did in G.I. Jane plus the fundamental importance of academics before athletics and life before basketball. That's why I liked the movie a lot, and it should relate very well to any teen of today. The basketball scenes featured in Coach Carter are of top-notch and contain really nothing fancy. In other words, I like to think Coach Carter of Hoop Dreams meets Hoosiers. As for the discipline side, it's almost Lean on Me; however, Joe Clark was there first. Now for the negatives of Coach Carter, I thought the profanity to be exceedingly too much for me, and I was incredibly disappointed in the usage of the language by the coach. It's so counterproductive and goes against what I believe in. Never in my life have I ever had a coach who uttered a four-letter word, and believe me, I have had a lot of coaches throughout childhood. Coach Carter should know better than that. Secondly, I was disappointed with lax strictness imposed by the coach especially when his players got caught sneaking away to a party filled with sex, alcohol, and probably drugs. I mean, what was that? That calls for a total expulsion of the players involved. But somehow, the coach swept it under the rug and moved on. I thought also that it was ridiculous that each time a player does something totally against Coach Carter's rules, he later gets taken back in form of begging. It's funny that when I finished the movie, I watched the special feature showing the real coach and the interviews by the former players. I was already informed by the ending of Coach Carter that many of them graduated from college and have degrees, but listening to the way they talk, they sure don't sound educated. Even worse, the coach would say things like, ""We was...,"" and ""They was..."" Come on, I expected a lot more from him. Another disappointing feature about Coach Carter is how good-looking everybody was. Sorry, it doesn't work that way in real world. Actually I found the ages of the actors playing high school basketball players to be hysterical. One of them is 27 when the movie was made; another was 22; another 23; another 26; and one was 31! That's why I knew how falsely portrayed their bodies were when it comes to high school setting. Another disappointment about Coach Carter is its advocate of abortion among teenage girls. That's just a poor message that was being given to impressionable kids and should have been completely dropped as a subplot from Coach Carter. What I said has nothing to do with my views on abortion because that's a very serious matter that ought to be explored elsewhere. Meanwhile, I remember one scene where there was a protest over the lockout, and some Asian dude just pumped his fist out. That was hilarious. Another scene shows a Latino getting gunned down due to a drug deal gone bad. Um, who cares? Is it just me, or do the high school cheerleaders look more like strippers? All in all, despite its MTV label, Coach Carter isn't a bad film but should be urged to be approached with some caution.",3,How Many Times Have We Seen This Before?,1290816000,"11 27, 2010",2010,3698,"['Viewed', '10/08Rate', '610/08', 'Coach', 'Carter', 'lot', 'good', 'points', 'also', 'several', 'bad', 'points', 'well', 'Samuel', 'Jackson', 'was', 'good', 'role', 'ought', 'do', 'more', 'same', 'type', 'work', 'lately', 'been', 'doing', 'crap', 'cast', 'was', 'very', 'good', 'turning', 'surprisingly', 'well-played', 'performances', 'find', 'plot', 'Coach', 'Carter', 'be', 'too', 'familiar', 'ringing', 'feeling', 'been', 'there', 'done', 'One', 'thing', 'had', ""n't"", 'really', 'expected', 'Coach', 'Carter', 'how', 'far', 'discipline', 'went', 'So', 'was', 'warm', 'welcome', 'enjoyed', 'very', 'much', 'Moreover', 'liked', 'fact', 'Coach', 'Carter', 'idea', 'teamwork', 'as', 'well', 'did', 'G.I', 'Jane', 'fundamental', 'importance', 'academics', 'athletics', 'life', 'basketball', 'why', 'liked', 'movie', 'lot', 'should', 'relate', 'very', 'well', 'teen', 'today', 'basketball', 'scenes', 'featured', 'Coach', 'Carter', 'are', 'top-notch', 'contain', 'really', 'nothing', 'fancy', 'other', 'words', 'like', 'think', 'Coach', 'Carter', 'Hoop', 'Dreams', 'Hoosiers', 'discipline', 'side', 'almost', 'Lean', 'Me', 'however', 'Joe', 'Clark', 'was', 'first', 'Now', 'negatives', 'Coach', 'Carter', 'thought', 'profanity', 'be', 'exceedingly', 'too', 'much', 'was', 'incredibly', 'disappointed', 'usage', 'language', 'coach', 'so', 'counterproductive', 'what', 'believe', 'Never', 'life', 'have', 'ever', 'had', 'coach', 'who', 'uttered', 'four-letter', 'word', 'believe', 'have', 'had', 'lot', 'coaches', 'childhood', 'Coach', 'Carter', 'should', 'know', 'better', 'Secondly', 'was', 'disappointed', 'lax', 'strictness', 'imposed', 'coach', 'especially', 'when', 'players', 'got', 'caught', 'sneaking', 'away', 'party', 'filled', 'sex', 'alcohol', 'probably', 'drugs', 'mean', 'what', 'was', 'total', 'expulsion', 'players', 'involved', 'somehow', 'coach', 'swept', 'rug', 'moved', 'thought', 'also', 'was', 'ridiculous', 'time', 'player', 'something', 'totally', 'Coach', 'Carter', 'rules', 'later', 'taken', 'back', 'form', 'begging', 'funny', 'when', 'finished', 'movie', 'watched', 'special', 'feature', 'showing', 'real', 'coach', 'interviews', 'former', 'players', 'was', 'already', 'informed', 'ending', 'Coach', 'Carter', 'many', 'graduated', 'college', 'have', 'degrees', 'listening', 'way', 'talk', 'sure', 'do', ""n't"", 'sound', 'educated', 'Even', 'worse', 'coach', 'would', 'say', 'things', 'was', 'was', 'Come', 'expected', 'lot', 'more', 'disappointing', 'feature', 'Coach', 'Carter', 'how', 'good-looking', 'everybody', 'was', 'Sorry', ""n't"", 'work', 'way', 'real', 'world', 'Actually', 'found', 'ages', 'actors', 'playing', 'high', 'school', 'basketball', 'players', 'be', 'hysterical', 'One', '27', 'when', 'movie', 'was', 'made', 'was', '22', '23', '26', 'one', 'was', '31', 'why', 'knew', 'how', 'falsely', 'portrayed', 'bodies', 'were', 'when', 'high', 'school', 'setting', 'disappointment', 'Coach', 'Carter', 'advocate', 'abortion', 'teenage', 'girls', 'just', 'poor', 'message', 'was', 'being', 'given', 'impressionable', 'kids', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'completely', 'dropped', 'subplot', 'Coach', 'Carter', 'What', 'said', 'nothing', 'do', 'views', 'abortion', 'very', 'serious', 'matter', 'ought', 'be', 'explored', 'elsewhere', 'Meanwhile', 'remember', 'one', 'scene', 'where', 'was', 'protest', 'lockout', 'Asian', 'dude', 'just', 'pumped', 'fist', 'out', 'was', 'hilarious', 'scene', 'Latino', 'getting', 'gunned', 'down', 'due', 'drug', 'deal', 'gone', 'bad', 'Um', 'who', 'just', 'do', 'high', 'school', 'cheerleaders', 'look', 'more', 'strippers', 'MTV', 'label', 'Coach', 'Carter', ""n't"", 'bad', 'film', 'should', 'be', 'urged', 'be', 'approached', 'caution']",N/A

Jackson discuss Coach Carter on the typical media blitz before the movie's release, you could tell this was a truly special role in his dynamite career. And the message delivered shows how sports - placed in its proper perspective - can boost young men to better understand the game of life.Ken Carter is a successful sporting goods owner who accepts the head coaching position at Richmond (Ca.) High School, where he had been a top athlete back in the day. But the game isn't all that Carter is coaching; he institutes written contracts for each player that includes behavior, dress code and grade stipulations.In 1999, Carter gained national attention when he benched his undefeated team due to poor academic achievement by 15 of the 45 players. Not only was the gym closed, there was a ban on all basketball-related activities and he was prepared to cancel the rest of the season, even with a bitter backlash from school officials, fans, players & their family members.Jackson does an outstanding job in portraying a coach who understood that a game can teach crucial lessons in life. Rick Gonzalez (Timo Cruz), Nana Gbewonyo (Junior Battle) and Ashanti (Kyra) also do great jobs, though the entire cast really clicked with the script.Coach Carter is not just a sports movie and its theme is very important for adults as much as it is for the athletes.",5,Sports In The Game Of Life,1171497600,"02 15, 2007",2007,1378,"['heard', 'Samuel', 'L.', 'Jackson', 'Coach', 'Carter', 'typical', 'media', 'blitz', 'movie', 'release', 'could', 'tell', 'was', 'truly', 'special', 'role', 'dynamite', 'career', 'message', 'delivered', 'how', 'sports', 'placed', 'proper', 'perspective', 'can', 'boost', 'young', 'men', 'better', 'understand', 'game', 'life.Ken', 'Carter', 'successful', 'sporting', 'goods', 'owner', 'who', 'head', 'coaching', 'position', 'Richmond', 'Ca', 'High', 'School', 'where', 'had', 'been', 'top', 'athlete', 'back', 'day', 'game', ""n't"", 'Carter', 'coaching', 'written', 'contracts', 'player', 'behavior', 'dress', 'code', 'grade', 'stipulations.In', '1999', 'Carter', 'gained', 'national', 'attention', 'when', 'benched', 'undefeated', 'team', 'due', 'poor', 'academic', 'achievement', '15', '45', 'players', 'Not', 'only', 'was', 'gym', 'closed', 'was', 'ban', 'basketball-related', 'activities', 'was', 'prepared', 'cancel', 'rest', 'season', 'even', 'bitter', 'backlash', 'school', 'officials', 'fans', 'players', 'family', 'members.Jackson', 'outstanding', 'job', 'portraying', 'coach', 'who', 'understood', 'game', 'can', 'teach', 'crucial', 'lessons', 'life', 'Rick', 'Gonzalez', 'Timo', 'Cruz', 'Nana', 'Gbewonyo', 'Junior', 'Battle', 'Ashanti', 'Kyra', 'also', 'do', 'great', 'jobs', 'entire', 'cast', 'really', 'clicked', 'script.Coach', 'Carter', 'not', 'just', 'sports', 'movie', 'theme', 'very', 'important', 'adults', 'as', 'much', 'athletes']",N/A

If you liked Remember the Titans, then this movie is a must. Samuel L. Jackson was made for this role as Ken Carter. Ken turned a bunch of high school nobody's that had more chance of going to prison than to college, into an undefeated basketball team. However, he made all the guys on the team sign contracts, stating that they would maintain a 2.3 GPA, go to all their classes, sit in the front row of their classes, and wear ties on gameday. But, when they started winning, some guys did not focus on this contract, and Ken locked the gym due to this. This forced the team to forfeit 2 of its games before being able to play again. It brings the team together and they go into the playoffs, but i will not say what happens from there. All there is to know is that Coach Carter really turns the boys on the basketball team into young men with great careers ahead of them. The best part about it is that it is all based on a true story, which occured just 8 years ago in 1998.

632660,A3JPFWKS83R49V,B00005JNNZ,"Bryan Carey ""Bryan Carey""","[1, 1]","Coach Carter is a fairly good film about one man's efforts to coach a group of high school kids and show them that there is more to life than playing basketball. This movie is based on the true story of Coach Ken Carter, an unconventional coach who made headline news in the state of California when he suspended the basketball season indefinitely until his players agreed to devote more time to their studies and comply with a contract each player signed with him at the start of the season.This movie offers a strong message and this is among its most important aspects. The message in this film is simple and it basically centers on the importance of self- discipline and education. Carter was once a player himself at the same high school and he grew to understand the importance of success off the court. Basketball is a fun sport and it can provide a means for development of teamwork concepts; physical fitness; and overall discipline. But Carter knew that success at basketball is limited. Playing college ball is possible but the likelihood that a player will succeed all the way to the NBA is unlikely. Therefore, it is important to never forget the importance of academics. Success in school will provide a back- up plan if success in basketball doesn't reach the professional level. Samuel Jackson's character preaches this fact over and over to his players and while they don't necessarily grasp his wisdom at first, they gradually mature and realize the importance of what their coach is trying to say.Most of this movie centers on Coach Carter and his interaction with the players and their parents but there are a couple of subplots in the background. One subplot involves the coaches own son, Damien Carter (played by Robert Ri'Chard). At the beginning of the movie, Damien is shown attending a private school- an institution that his father enrolled him because he felt it would provide his son with the greatest chance for academic success. Damien, however, decides he would rather be at Richmond with his dad so he quits the school under the strict conditions of his father and joins the Richmond basketball team. In another subplot, one of the players has some personal issues to work out with his girlfriend who is now pregnant. These subplots offer a break from the rest of the movie but they don't add much to its overall value.I like Samuel Jackson's performance as the hard- nosed head coach but most of the other performances in this movie are only average. Several of the actors in this movie who portray different basketball players (like Robert R'Chard, Channing Tatum, and Antown Tanner) got their start on television and have limited experience on the big screen. They seem to be adequate in their roles but none of them is very memorable and none of the characters stand out in the crowd. They get the job done, but with few signs of any exceptional talent.By far the greatest criticism I have for Coach Carter is with its script. The dialogue throughout the movie is weak and I started to wonder what was going on in the minds of the film's writers when they composed this script. The dialogue is forgettable and there are no memorable quotes at all. Even Samuel Jackson, who does a great deal of sermonizing in this movie, can't come up with any memorable statements. And the players make clich&eacute;- ridden statements typical of what one would expect from unmotivated inner city youth. That is to say, their comments are mostly forgettable.The DVD of Coach Carter includes a few extras like deleted scenes and a music video but the best among them is a feature on Coach Ken Carter and some of the actual players whom this movie is based on. Carter talks about his tenure as coach, his relationships with the players, and his feelings about basketball and academics. There are also some words from the players with each of them explaining what it was like to play for a guy like Ken Carter and how his influence has affected their lives both on and off the court.With the flaws in the subplots and dialogue, Coach Carter loses a few points with me but I still think it has enough good qualities to give it a slight recommendation. It moves at a good clip and the basketball game scenes are well- made and entertaining. The script was weak and the subplots useless but there is no denying the importance of the main message of the movie: That there is more to life than sports and everyone needs to strive to be the best in the classroom in order to have the best chance for success. Self- discipline and respect are important qualities for all, and their implementation will go a long way toward fulfillment in life.",3,Ken Carter Reshapes a Basketball Team,1152057600,"07 5, 2006",2006,4654,"['Coach', 'Carter', 'fairly', 'good', 'film', 'one', 'man', 'efforts', 'coach', 'group', 'high', 'school', 'kids', 'show', 'more', 'life', 'playing', 'basketball', 'movie', 'based', 'true', 'story', 'Coach', 'Ken', 'Carter', 'unconventional', 'coach', 'who', 'made', 'headline', 'news', 'state', 'California', 'when', 'suspended', 'basketball', 'season', 'indefinitely', 'players', 'agreed', 'devote', 'more', 'time', 'studies', 'comply', 'contract', 'player', 'signed', 'start', 'season.This', 'movie', 'strong', 'message', 'most', 'important', 'aspects', 'message', 'film', 'simple', 'basically', 'centers', 'importance', 'self-', 'discipline', 'education', 'Carter', 'was', 'once', 'player', 'same', 'high', 'school', 'grew', 'understand', 'importance', 'success', 'court', 'Basketball', 'fun', 'sport', 'can', 'provide', 'means', 'development', 'teamwork', 'concepts', 'physical', 'fitness', 'overall', 'discipline', 'Carter', 'knew', 'success', 'basketball', 'limited', 'Playing', 'college', 'ball', 'possible', 'likelihood', 'player', 'will', 'succeed', 'way', 'NBA', 'unlikely', 'Therefore', 'important', 'never', 'forget', 'importance', 'academics', 'Success', 'school', 'will', 'provide', 'back-', 'up', 'plan', 'success', 'basketball', ""n't"", 'reach', 'professional', 'level', 'Samuel', 'Jackson', 'character', 'fact', 'players', 'do', ""n't"", 'necessarily', 'grasp', 'wisdom', 'first', 'gradually', 'mature', 'realize', 'importance', 'what', 'coach', 'trying', 'say.Most', 'movie', 'centers', 'Coach', 'Carter', 'interaction', 'players', 'parents', 'are', 'couple', 'subplots', 'background', 'One', 'subplot', 'coaches', 'own', 'son', 'Damien', 'Carter', 'played', 'Robert', ""Ri'Chard"", 'beginning', 'movie', 'Damien', 'shown', 'attending', 'private', 'school-', 'institution', 'father', 'enrolled', 'felt', 'would', 'provide', 'son', 'greatest', 'chance', 'academic', 'success', 'Damien', 'however', 'would', 'rather', 'be', 'Richmond', 'dad', 'so', 'school', 'strict', 'conditions', 'father', 'Richmond', 'basketball', 'team', 'subplot', 'one', 'players', 'personal', 'issues', 'work', 'out', 'girlfriend', 'who', 'now', 'pregnant', 'subplots', 'offer', 'break', 'rest', 'movie', 'do', ""n't"", 'add', 'much', 'overall', 'value.I', 'Samuel', 'Jackson', 'performance', 'hard-', 'nosed', 'head', 'coach', 'most', 'other', 'performances', 'movie', 'are', 'only', 'average', 'Several', 'actors', 'movie', 'who', 'portray', 'different', 'basketball', 'players', 'Robert', ""R'Chard"", 'Channing', 'Tatum', 'Antown', 'Tanner', 'got', 'start', 'television', 'have', 'limited', 'experience', 'big', 'screen', 'seem', 'be', 'adequate', 'roles', 'none', 'very', 'memorable', 'none', 'characters', 'stand', 'out', 'crowd', 'get', 'job', 'done', 'few', 'signs', 'exceptional', 'talent.By', 'far', 'greatest', 'criticism', 'have', 'Coach', 'Carter', 'script', 'dialogue', 'movie', 'weak', 'started', 'wonder', 'what', 'was', 'going', 'minds', 'film', 'writers', 'when', 'composed', 'script', 'dialogue', 'forgettable', 'are', 'memorable', 'quotes', 'Even', 'Samuel', 'Jackson', 'who', 'great', 'deal', 'sermonizing', 'movie', 'ca', ""n't"", 'come', 'up', 'memorable', 'statements', 'players', 'make', 'clich', 'eacute', 'ridden', 'statements', 'typical', 'what', 'one', 'would', 'expect', 'unmotivated', 'inner', 'city', 'youth', 'say', 'comments', 'are', 'mostly', 'forgettable.The', 'DVD', 'Coach', 'Carter', 'few', 'extras', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'music', 'video', 'best', 'feature', 'Coach', 'Ken', 'Carter', 'actual', 'players', 'whom', 'movie', 'based', 'Carter', 'talks', 'tenure', 'coach', 'relationships', 'players', 'feelings', 'basketball', 'academics', 'are', 'also', 'words', 'players', 'explaining', 'what', 'was', 'play', 'guy', 'Ken', 'Carter', 'how', 'influence', 'affected', 'lives', 'court.With', 'flaws', 'subplots', 'dialogue', 'Coach', 'Carter', 'few', 'points', 'still', 'think', 'enough', 'good', 'qualities', 'give', 'slight', 'recommendation', 'good', 'clip', 'basketball', 'game', 'scenes', 'are', 'well-', 'made', 'entertaining', 'script', 'was', 'weak', 'subplots', 'useless', 'denying', 'importance', 'main', 'message', 'movie', 'more', 'life', 'sports', 'everyone', 'needs', 'strive', 'be', 'best', 'classroom', 'order', 'have', 'best', 'chance', 'success', 'Self-', 'discipline', 'respect', 'are', 'important', 'qualities', 'implementation', 'will', 'go', 'long', 'way', 'fulfillment', 'life']",N/A

Ken Carter was an All-American basketball star at Richmond High School in the early 1970s.  He had personal experience with the grinding poverty, broken homes, and inadequate education these students faced.  He was a businessman rather than a teacher when he took over the basketball team.Because he wanted them to find a better path in life than the one put in front of them, he had each of the players sign a player contract.  The player signed, the parent(s) signed it, and the coach signed it.  It asked for a higher GPA than required by the school board.  When he explains why he wanted a 2.3 than the 2.0 required is, I think, one of the great moments in the film.  Simply, those few higher GPA points would mean that a player could get be eligible to play in an NCAA program with a lower SAT score.  So, it increased the likelihood that they could go to college.  It wasn't an empty gesture, it was to make the path to college and a better life more available to his student-athletes.Coach Carter became a national sensation when he found that some of his players were not hold up the end of their academic commitment.  He locked the gym and forfeited games.  The idea being that they were a team and they succeeded or failed as a team.  I think this nobility of no one being left behind is fabulous.  However, many in Richmond went ballistic and the Coach decided to quit rather than relent.  What follows is the climax of the film.Samuel L. Jackson does a fabulous job and the portions of the game shown are done very well.  I like the way that they show whole plays rather than a bunch of quick cuts pretending to be plays.  It was also nice that they kept it looking like high school ball rather than college ball or pro-ball.  And they use the shots of training and the games to illustrate and support the undergirding points of the film.The players all do a fine job.  They have very difficult personal lives and while Coach Carter is very tough and some would say harsh, those that stayed on the team rose to the occasion and were better for it.  In an accompanying feature showing the real Coach Carter and the real players, one of the players seems to still be quite full of himself and still not understand what the coach was trying to do for him, but what can you do?  Sometimes water can't get to the inside of a rock.The extras are nice including deleted scenes.  This is a great movie to watch with your kids and talk about what is going on and why you hold the values you do.  There is much rough language, some sensuality and violence, and one story element of a pregnancy that ends with an abortion with adoption never coming up in the discussion.  But this was real life and choices made by real people in life circumstances most of us will never know.  We can learn from this story and be inspired by what Coach Carter and his athletes did and learned in that 1999 season.",4,Inspiring true life story - well done film,1120521600,"07 5, 2005",2005,3050,"['Based', 'events', 'real', 'recent', 'story', 'difference', 'commitment', 'standards', 'goals', 'can', 'make', 'inspirational', 'instructive', 'Ken', 'Carter', 'was', 'All-American', 'basketball', 'star', 'Richmond', 'High', 'School', 'early', '1970s', 'had', 'personal', 'experience', 'grinding', 'poverty', 'broken', 'homes', 'inadequate', 'education', 'students', 'faced', 'was', 'businessman', 'rather', 'teacher', 'when', 'took', 'over', 'basketball', 'team.Because', 'wanted', 'find', 'better', 'path', 'life', 'one', 'put', 'front', 'had', 'players', 'sign', 'player', 'contract', 'player', 'signed', 'parent', 'signed', 'coach', 'signed', 'asked', 'higher', 'GPA', 'required', 'school', 'board', 'When', 'why', 'wanted', '2.3', '2.0', 'required', 'think', 'one', 'great', 'moments', 'film', 'Simply', 'few', 'higher', 'GPA', 'points', 'would', 'mean', 'player', 'could', 'get', 'be', 'eligible', 'play', 'NCAA', 'program', 'lower', 'SAT', 'score', 'So', 'increased', 'likelihood', 'could', 'go', 'college', 'was', ""n't"", 'empty', 'gesture', 'was', 'make', 'path', 'college', 'better', 'life', 'more', 'available', 'student-athletes.Coach', 'Carter', 'became', 'national', 'sensation', 'when', 'found', 'players', 'were', 'not', 'hold', 'up', 'end', 'academic', 'commitment', 'locked', 'gym', 'forfeited', 'games', 'idea', 'being', 'were', 'team', 'succeeded', 'failed', 'team', 'think', 'nobility', 'one', 'being', 'left', 'behind', 'fabulous', 'However', 'many', 'Richmond', 'went', 'ballistic', 'Coach', 'decided', 'quit', 'rather', 'relent', 'What', 'climax', 'film.Samuel', 'L.', 'Jackson', 'fabulous', 'job', 'portions', 'game', 'shown', 'are', 'done', 'very', 'well', 'way', 'show', 'whole', 'plays', 'rather', 'bunch', 'quick', 'cuts', 'pretending', 'be', 'plays', 'was', 'also', 'nice', 'kept', 'looking', 'high', 'school', 'ball', 'rather', 'college', 'ball', 'pro-ball', 'use', 'shots', 'training', 'games', 'illustrate', 'support', 'undergirding', 'points', 'film.The', 'players', 'do', 'fine', 'job', 'have', 'very', 'difficult', 'personal', 'lives', 'Coach', 'Carter', 'very', 'tough', 'would', 'say', 'harsh', 'stayed', 'team', 'rose', 'occasion', 'were', 'better', 'accompanying', 'feature', 'showing', 'real', 'Coach', 'Carter', 'real', 'players', 'one', 'players', 'still', 'be', 'quite', 'full', 'still', 'not', 'understand', 'what', 'coach', 'was', 'trying', 'do', 'what', 'can', 'do', 'Sometimes', 'water', 'ca', ""n't"", 'get', 'inside', 'rock.The', 'extras', 'are', 'nice', 'including', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'great', 'movie', 'watch', 'kids', 'talk', 'what', 'going', 'why', 'hold', 'values', 'do', 'much', 'rough', 'language', 'sensuality', 'violence', 'one', 'story', 'element', 'pregnancy', 'abortion', 'adoption', 'never', 'coming', 'up', 'discussion', 'was', 'real', 'life', 'choices', 'made', 'real', 'people', 'life', 'circumstances', 'most', 'will', 'never', 'know', 'can', 'learn', 'story', 'be', 'inspired', 'what', 'Coach', 'Carter', 'athletes', 'did', 'learned', '1999', 'season']",N/A

Coach Carter's players were headed down the a path that they refused to see.  I believe it is always easier to see where people are headed when looking from afar - much like watching a movie.Samuel L. Jackson is extremely convincing in his role as the coach who benched his team unitl they began to take their education seriously.  I always rate movies based on how well they draw me into the film.  I only give out a five-star rating when the movie is so good that I forget I am watching a movie.  Jackson's acting caused that to happen a few times.  The man is a genius on screen.There are a lot of great actors in this film.  Rob Brown, Robert Ri'chard, Rick Gonzalez, Nana Gbewonyo, Antwon Tanner, Channing Tatum, and Texas Battle are great in this film!  Ashanti came up a little flat in this one.  She needed more raw emotion in her character.  She actually underacted.  I guess that's better than overacting her part as Kyra.This movie has plenty of great moments, but at times it did seem to be a little long.  I think it could have been twenty minutes shorter and still brought home its message.But once again, Samuel L. Jackson is a genius on the big screen.  I just learned that he has four more movies coming out very soon.

632670,A3KF4IP2MUS8QQ,B00005JNNZ,"Daniel Jolley ""darkgenius""","[0, 0]","They seem to come out with a couple of these ""coach transforms team"" movies every year, and I'll be doggoned if they don't keep getting better and better.  It's not hard to make a sports movie; throw some B-ball and cheerleaders in there somewhere, and we guys will watch it.  It is hard, however, to make a good sports film.  Coach Carter is the best kind of sports film because, when it comes down to it, the heart of the story really isn't about sports at all.  It's about changing kids' lives and inspiring/threatening them to go out there and make a better life for themselves.  Coach Carter succeeds where Friday Night Lights fails - yes, Friday Night Lights is a terrific film, but the message it conveys in the end is that sports, especially winning, is more important than anything else.  Coach Carter cares about his kids a whole lot more than he cares about winning.The basic story is pretty simple.  Coach Carter takes over a team of undisciplined players who are used to losing games and underachieving in the classroom.  Things are going to change.  He tells the kids that they will win if they do as he says, but they will have to earn it, and they will have to hit the books as well as the courts if they are going to play for him.  He makes them sign a contract: they have to agree to maintain a 2.3 GPA, attend all their classes (and sit on the front row), and dress up on game days.  These requirements go beyond state guidelines for academic eligibility.  Initially, many of the players balk, and one even walks.  Coach has his guys ready to play, however, and they start out on a tremendous run.  The kids get big heads and so some stupid things - and they pay for it.  Things hit rock bottom, though, when Coach Carter finds out that many of his kids have not lived up to their agreements: several are skipping class and failing.  That's when Coach Carter locks up the gym and cancels practice as well as key games until such time as his team has lived up to their agreement.The tragic part of this story is not the kids, it's the school administration and the parents.  Some of the parents have fits over the stipulations of the coach-player contracts, but the whole community goes apoplectic when Carter actually starts forfeiting games.  Let the kids play, they yell, because basketball is all these kids have in life.  Boy, that's a great message to give your kids, isn't it?  Then you have the school principal who is seemingly satisfied with mediocrity; only half of her students actually graduate, and she seems to think that's just the ways things have to be.  She doesn't approve of the academic requirements Coach Carter institutes with his team, and she doesn't like the lockout one bit.  Worst of all, she completely stymies Carter's request for academic progress reports from his players' teachers - that's why he doesn't find out half of them are flunking until well into the season.  The school board is no better, clearly putting sports before academics.  Coach Carter has to fight an uphill battle not only with his kids, but with the very people charged with educating them.  That is a disheartening reality in two many school districts today - and few schools will be lucky enough to have a Coach Carter to stir things up.Naturally, the movie takes us to a number of basketball games, but they don't dominate the story, not by a long shot.  The only quibble I have about the games concerns the big game at the end.  During the obligatory win-or-lose shot hanging in the air for an eternity, some of the fans in the crowd seem to be smiling.  I've lived through a number of these eternity-stretching last shots, and never have I smiled - I've grimaced, certainly; I've gotten down on my hands and knees on many an occasion; I've lifted my hands in earnest supplication to the Almighty; I've grabbed my hair and hung on for dear life - but never, ever have I smiled in such moments.Based on a true story, Coach Carter is a wonderful, inspirational film, and Samuel L. Jackson is terrific in the role of Coach Carter.  This movie sends all the right messages to youngsters, especially those whom society basically expects to fail, using various compelling subplots to validate the whole story in reality.  It also serves as a clarion call to parents; you can't always depend on the school system to educate your children - and if you don't care about your child's education, he or she probably won't care either.",5,"The best, most inspirational sports film in years",1126051200,"09 7, 2005",2005,4450,"['seem', 'come', 'out', 'couple', 'coach', 'transforms', 'team', 'movies', 'year', ""'ll"", 'be', 'doggoned', 'do', ""n't"", 'keep', 'getting', 'better', 'better', 'not', 'hard', 'make', 'sports', 'movie', 'throw', 'B-ball', 'cheerleaders', 'somewhere', 'guys', 'will', 'watch', 'hard', 'however', 'make', 'good', 'sports', 'film', 'Coach', 'Carter', 'best', 'kind', 'sports', 'film', 'when', 'down', 'heart', 'story', 'really', ""n't"", 'about', 'sports', 'changing', 'kids', 'lives', 'inspiring/threatening', 'go', 'out', 'there', 'make', 'better', 'life', 'Coach', 'Carter', 'where', 'Friday', 'Night', 'Lights', 'yes', 'Friday', 'Night', 'Lights', 'terrific', 'film', 'message', 'end', 'sports', 'especially', 'winning', 'more', 'important', 'anything', 'else', 'Coach', 'Carter', 'kids', 'whole', 'lot', 'more', 'winning.The', 'basic', 'story', 'pretty', 'simple', 'Coach', 'Carter', 'team', 'undisciplined', 'players', 'who', 'are', 'used', 'losing', 'games', 'underachieving', 'classroom', 'Things', 'are', 'going', 'change', 'kids', 'will', 'win', 'do', 'will', 'have', 'earn', 'will', 'have', 'hit', 'books', 'as', 'well', 'courts', 'are', 'going', 'play', 'sign', 'contract', 'have', 'agree', 'maintain', '2.3', 'GPA', 'attend', 'classes', 'sit', 'front', 'row', 'dress', 'up', 'game', 'days', 'requirements', 'go', 'state', 'guidelines', 'academic', 'eligibility', 'Initially', 'many', 'players', 'balk', 'one', 'even', 'walks', 'Coach', 'guys', 'ready', 'play', 'however', 'start', 'out', 'tremendous', 'run', 'kids', 'get', 'big', 'heads', 'so', 'stupid', 'things', 'pay', 'Things', 'hit', 'rock', 'bottom', 'though', 'when', 'Coach', 'Carter', 'out', 'many', 'kids', 'have', 'not', 'lived', 'up', 'agreements', 'several', 'are', 'skipping', 'class', 'failing', 'when', 'Coach', 'Carter', 'up', 'gym', 'cancels', 'practice', 'as', 'well', 'key', 'games', 'such', 'time', 'team', 'lived', 'up', 'agreement.The', 'tragic', 'part', 'story', 'not', 'kids', 'school', 'administration', 'parents', 'parents', 'have', 'fits', 'stipulations', 'coach-player', 'contracts', 'whole', 'community', 'apoplectic', 'when', 'Carter', 'actually', 'forfeiting', 'games', 'Let', 'kids', 'play', 'yell', 'basketball', 'kids', 'have', 'life', 'Boy', 'great', 'message', 'give', 'kids', ""n't"", 'Then', 'have', 'school', 'principal', 'who', 'seemingly', 'satisfied', 'mediocrity', 'only', 'half', 'students', 'actually', 'graduate', 'think', 'just', 'ways', 'things', 'have', 'be', ""n't"", 'approve', 'academic', 'requirements', 'Coach', 'Carter', 'team', ""n't"", 'like', 'lockout', 'one', 'bit', 'Worst', 'completely', 'Carter', 'request', 'academic', 'progress', 'reports', 'players', 'teachers', 'why', ""n't"", 'find', 'out', 'half', 'are', 'flunking', 'well', 'season', 'school', 'board', 'better', 'clearly', 'putting', 'sports', 'academics', 'Coach', 'Carter', 'fight', 'uphill', 'battle', 'not', 'only', 'kids', 'very', 'people', 'charged', 'educating', 'disheartening', 'reality', 'two', 'many', 'school', 'districts', 'today', 'few', 'schools', 'will', 'be', 'lucky', 'enough', 'have', 'Coach', 'Carter', 'stir', 'things', 'up.Naturally', 'movie', 'number', 'basketball', 'games', 'do', ""n't"", 'dominate', 'story', 'not', 'long', 'shot', 'only', 'quibble', 'have', 'games', 'concerns', 'big', 'game', 'end', 'obligatory', 'win-or-lose', 'shot', 'hanging', 'air', 'eternity', 'fans', 'crowd', 'seem', 'be', 'smiling', ""'ve"", 'lived', 'number', 'eternity-stretching', 'last', 'shots', 'never', 'have', 'smiled', ""'ve"", 'grimaced', 'certainly', ""'ve"", 'gotten', 'down', 'hands', 'knees', 'many', 'occasion', ""'ve"", 'lifted', 'hands', 'earnest', 'supplication', 'Almighty', ""'ve"", 'grabbed', 'hair', 'hung', 'dear', 'life', 'never', 'ever', 'have', 'smiled', 'such', 'moments.Based', 'true', 'story', 'Coach', 'Carter', 'wonderful', 'inspirational', 'film', 'Samuel', 'L.', 'Jackson', 'terrific', 'role', 'Coach', 'Carter', 'movie', 'right', 'messages', 'youngsters', 'especially', 'whom', 'society', 'basically', 'fail', 'using', 'various', 'compelling', 'subplots', 'validate', 'whole', 'story', 'reality', 'also', 'clarion', 'call', 'parents', 'ca', ""n't"", 'always', 'depend', 'school', 'system', 'educate', 'children', 'do', ""n't"", 'care', 'child', 'education', 'probably', 'wo', ""n't"", 'care', 'either']",N/A
632671,A1HJZL0WKCOTSF,B00005JNNZ,"Dan ""Longsword""","[3, 3]","I'm always skeptical when I see ads for films like ""Coach Carter"" because they're so often filled with melodrama.This film, too, has moments of clich&eacute; and sensationalism, but it fights hard to keep these to a minimum and succeeds often enough to make it entertaining. Part of the appeal comes from Samuel L. Jackson's strong persona, and the fact that the story itself is based on true events. But, the real strength of the film lies primarily with its young, unknown actors. The boys are true to their characters, even when the dialogue must have made them cringe.Like an inner-city ""Hoosiers,"" though lacking that film's depth, ""Coach Carter"" tells the true story of Ken Carter, a determined coach who takes over a team of problem kids and turns them into winners, both on and off the court. He teaches them discipline, respect for themselves and others, and even asks them to sign a contract stating that they will promise to keep their GPA at or above a 2.3 average, that they will be on time and that they will wear ties on game days. This causes a stir among the players, their parents and the principal of the school, but when they see the results of Carter's teachings, they come to respect his unorthodox ways, especially when the team starts winning. His extreme methods are questioned again, however, when he locks the gym, cancels practice and forfeits two games after discovering that the boys are struggling academically. Determined to raise their grades and give them a fighting chance to go to college, Carter takes them off the court and into the library for tutoring and studying. This brings him a rash of violent threats, parental lashings and even a school board hearing, forcing him to stand behind his convictions and defend his beliefs.I won't ruin the ending by going on, but suffice it to say that lessons are learned and the boys come out better students and better people as a result of Carter's hard-nosed military-like tactics.The basketball scenes are exciting and well orchestrated in this film. But, the real strengths of this film come from the boys themselves, their characters and their inner struggles off the court. Their challenges come in the forms of teen pregnancy and a shooting, along with the everyday trials of living in an area where they are 50 percent more likely to go to prison than to graduate from high school.Rick Gonzalez turns in a solid performance as a kid struggling to decide between basketball and working for his cousin as a drug dealer.

632672,A2VD3CYOEMJ6SR,B00005JNNZ,David E. Levine,"[4, 4]","This is the type of movie we have seen before, i.e., the tough teacher or coach who whips a tough bunch of kids into shape and they end up defying expectations. This type of movie has to follow the formula in order to work, however. Afterall, if the tough coach fails to turn lives around, then what would the movie be? Similarly, if the coach has an easy job to do and a group of overpriviledged kids live up to their high expectations, again, what kind of a movie would it be? So, whether the movie works is really in how well the story is told and in the twists and turns in its telling since we know what the formula is. Here, it is very well done and the result is a wonderful movie.Coach Ken Carter, a successful local businessman, takes on the daunting task of coaching the basketball team in his Richmond, CA. alma mater, where he was a star high school player a generation earlier. The kids are tough but Coach Carter is tougher. In order to play on the team, they must follow an almost unendurable regimen of fitness and discipline. If they are guilty of transgressions, they have to do an unimaginable number of pushups and suicides. They sign contracts in which they agree to do well in school. When academic updates show that they have fallen short in their studies, coach Carter cancels games, practice and locks the gym. In order for the season to resume, they must improve in the classroom.Predictably, Coach Carter receives resistance from parents, teachers, the school administration and the school board. In spite of these obstacles, he pushes on. The results are heartwarming and a trailer at the end of the movie shows that most of his players went on to achieve success after graduating from high school. So, not only did Coach carter mold a fine team, he changed lives.Yes, we kow how the movie will unfold but, it unfolds so well and the movie is so well cast that it is a five star effort which I highly recommend.",5,Formulaic but nonetheless superb,1124582400,"08 21, 2005",2005,1939,"['type', 'movie', 'have', 'seen', 'i.e.', 'tough', 'teacher', 'coach', 'who', 'tough', 'bunch', 'kids', 'shape', 'end', 'up', 'defying', 'expectations', 'type', 'movie', 'follow', 'formula', 'order', 'work', 'however', 'Afterall', 'tough', 'coach', 'turn', 'lives', 'then', 'what', 'would', 'movie', 'be', 'Similarly', 'coach', 'easy', 'job', 'do', 'group', 'overpriviledged', 'kids', 'live', 'up', 'high', 'expectations', 'again', 'what', 'kind', 'movie', 'would', 'be', 'So', 'movie', 'really', 'how', 'well', 'story', 'told', 'twists', 'telling', 'know', 'what', 'formula', 'Here', 'very', 'well', 'done', 'result', 'wonderful', 'movie.Coach', 'Ken', 'Carter', 'successful', 'local', 'businessman', 'daunting', 'task', 'coaching', 'basketball', 'team', 'Richmond', 'CA', 'alma', 'mater', 'where', 'was', 'star', 'high', 'school', 'player', 'generation', 'earlier', 'kids', 'are', 'tough', 'Coach', 'Carter', 'tougher', 'order', 'play', 'team', 'must', 'follow', 'almost', 'unendurable', 'regimen', 'fitness', 'discipline', 'are', 'guilty', 'transgressions', 'have', 'do', 'unimaginable', 'number', 'pushups', 'suicides', 'sign', 'contracts', 'agree', 'do', 'well', 'school', 'When', 'academic', 'updates', 'show', 'have', 'fallen', 'short', 'studies', 'coach', 'Carter', 'cancels', 'games', 'practice', 'gym', 'order', 'season', 'resume', 'must', 'improve', 'classroom.Predictably', 'Coach', 'Carter', 'resistance', 'parents', 'teachers', 'school', 'administration', 'school', 'board', 'spite', 'obstacles', 'results', 'are', 'heartwarming', 'trailer', 'end', 'movie', 'most', 'players', 'went', 'achieve', 'success', 'graduating', 'high', 'school', 'So', 'not', 'only', 'did', 'Coach', 'carter', 'mold', 'fine', 'team', 'changed', 'lives.Yes', 'kow', 'how', 'movie', 'will', 'unfold', 'so', 'well', 'movie', 'so', 'well', 'cast', 'five', 'star', 'effort', 'highly', 'recommend']",N/A
632673,A3GKOMCQTTWPUI,B00005JNNZ,"David Foskin ""SneakyGoblin on XBL""","[0, 1]","Inspirational, entertaining and gripping, Coach Carter is the first great movie of 2005, a memorable star vehicle for Samuel L. Jackson that may just go down in history as one of the best basketball movies ever made. You don't need to be a fan of the game to appreciate this tale of troubled youths being pushed to succeed and treat themselves with respect; all you have to be is human.Based on a true story, Jackson is Coach Ken Carter, a militaristic man's man who takes over a high school basketball team in the ghetto. With their selfish playing style and lack of respect for the game, the Richmond Oilers seem destined to repeat the previous season's win total of four. The new coach, however, brings with him an innovative program that requires them to make pledges including maintaining a 2.3 grade point average, attending class and sitting in the front row. When things start to turn around and the team puts together a historical winning streak, Coach Carter is forced to implement his academic policy by locking the team out of the gymnasium. It turns out that Coach Carter has a lot to teach these young men, and basketball is pretty far down the list.Veteran director Thomas Carter (Save the Last Dance) shows a real knack for avoiding the pitfalls of the sports movie by keeping the emphasis where it belongs: on the people. The scenes on the court are not only well-photographed and edited together, but they carry more emotional resonance because of the way that Carter juggles each storyline so effectively. As you get to know the coach and his team, it's impossible not to root for them; as he teaches them to respect others, strive for an education and lose their thug personas, it's even harder to disagree.The basketball players are a strong collection of young actors that includes Rob Brown (Finding Forrester), Robert Ri'chard (the upcoming House of Wax), Antwon Tanner (187) and Rick Gonzalez (Old School). Each leave lasting impressions, crafting characters whose lives and problems are worthy diversions when there's no ball to be seen. Gonzalez particularly impresses as the tough-talking Timo Cruz, a troubled youth at a crossroads who rejects Coach Carter's authority until he finds himself confronted with a tragedy.As Coach Carter talks to these boys, telling them that their future lies in their own hands and that the world wants them to fail, you can feel the inspirational words floating down off the screen and into the audience. This is the type of movie that can inspire kids to go to college, or just as easily get you to go home, type up that resume, and apply for a better job. There are few actors who could balance the abundance of strength and wisdom that Samuel L. Jackson brings to the role with the hipness that makes people want to listen to him.For Jackson, the part of Coach Carter should become the leading-man breakthrough he's been trying to have for years. When these kids greet their coach with the n-word and he responds by calling them 'sir', the character is in danger of becoming too stiff; when he responds to a dissenting student by pushing his face into the wall, the pendulum swings the other way towards fears of The Substitute 5. But Jackson walks the line so well that you can't imagine anyone else in the role. When he reminisces about his old glory days, you believe him; when he shows the importance of principles, you wish you could have his convictions. And when it comes time to convince us that his team wouldn't want to make him angry, well, he is Samuel L. Jackson.The only problems with Coach Carter stem from the ambiguous time period and a few subplots that are handled too carelessly. The real Coach Carter led his team to victory in 1999, yet this movie tries to remain relevant with several references to LeBron James, who was just beginning to make a splash that season. A storyline involving the singer Ashanti as a teenage girl pregnant by one of the players goes too long and then is resolved far too neatly, and the mutually respectful relationship between the coach and his son Damien (Ri'chard) simply doesn't ring true for two men who seem so stubborn.In the end, Thomas Carter whips out a few tricks to throw our concept of the sports movie on its ear and remind us all that sports are a pastime to be appreciated, but also one that teaches valuable life lessons. How to buck the odds, how to make a lasting impression, how to inform without getting too preachy. These are lessons that could not only be taught by Samuel L. Jackson's titular coach, but by the director who shares his surname as well.",4,Very good.

Carter then asks the team who won the state title last year and nobody knows the answer.

Mikels ""It's always Happy Hour here""","[0, 0]","Gotta love a great ""stand up and cheer"" movie--a feel-good flick that puts pride in your heart and a lump in your throat.  Such a creature is COACH CARTER, based on the true story of one Ken Carter, who returns to his alma mater--a California urban school--to take over the basketball team, but more importantly, to emphasize the word ""student"" in the phrase ""student athlete.""  Winning games is wonderful, according to Coach Carter--but winning in the classroom is even more wonderful.  Thus he drafts a contract for his players--and their parents--whereby they agree to make more than the required 2.00 GPA, plus faithfully go to class.  When some of his charges fail to live up to the document, Coach Carter locks his team out of the gym.  Now he's got the entire community's attention--not to mention the country--yet Carter perseveres and his bacon is ultimately saved--from a negative school board and outraged parents--by his own players.  Once the student athletes excel in the classroom they enjoy even more success on the court, leading to some terrific hoops sequences.Samuel L. Jackson gives a stellar performance in the title roll.  He's tough, demanding, sometimes harsh and shrill, yet he's also fair and compassionate, given a particular circumstance.  His players are totally believable as basketball hoopsters, led by the always-sturdy Rob Brown, who was such a debut sensation in the remarkable filmFinding Forrester.

Jackson provides the inspiration to a bunch of high school students, whose only interest in life is playing basketball and getting into trouble. Coming from very humble backgrounds, the characters in this film have led a life of poverty and despair. They are talented, but unmotivated basketball players and have little to no interest in school work. Coach Carter puts an end to that by shutting down the basketball court until all of the basketball players have attained an acceptable grade point average. By teaching the ball players that life exists beyond the basketball court, he inspires them to become better students, so that they will be able to live a better life. By setting extremely high expectations of his students, he instills in them the qualities that will not only make them better ball players, but provide them with the skills and motivation to become better individuals and to excel at whatever it is that they desire to do with their lives. Watching a bunch of spoiled losers transform into a bunch of confident winners, provides the inspiration that is so lacking in many of today's young people.

Jackson, and tells the true story of Coach Ken Carter from Richmond High School in inner city Los Angeles, California.Carter is a self-made man, a strict disciplinarian, and owner of his own Sporting Goods Store. As the film begins, Carter has returned to old alma mater to watch a basketball game against St. Joseph, the High School his son is attending. Prior to game, Coach Carter has already been approached by the school's current coach to take over the team.Richmond is severely thrashed, their undisciplined, their cocky, and unruly. Carter accepts the coaching position; however, it has to be on his terms. Richmond had only won 4 total games the previously year, so Coach Carter was afforded his request.Carter required all of his players to sign a contract before any of them could play ball. The contract required each player to maintain a 2.3 G.P.A., attend all scheduled classes, and to sit in the front row of all classes in which they attended. He required Progress Reports for all teachers documenting each player's academics. He also required each player to dress appropriately on Game Day, with Tie and Coat; this promoted respect in the team, and respect for oneself.Prior to the season's start, no one even knew who or where Richmond High School was, but rigorous practices, forced discipline, and strict guidance from carter turned them into winners; however, that's where the trouble started.Winning was easy, Carter had a plan; and the team executed it superbly. However, Carter wanted more for these players; he wanted hope, desire, and the ability to lift themselves above the life in which they were headed. He wanted his players to have the ability to attended college; and this could only happen if their grades were good enough.However, Richmond H.S. only graduates 33% of their seniors and over 60% of those are female. Carter explained that his player stood a better chance going to Jail than college. Once the Progress Reports were published, six of his players were failing at least one or more of their classes. So Carter at 16-0, undefeated and headed to the state championships, locked the gym doors and started forfeiting games; turning basketball practice sessions into tutoring lessons for the players. This is when the sh@# hit the proverbial fan.....In the semblance of Stand and Deliver, Remember the Titans, and Hoosiers, Coach Carter is another story about one man against insurmountable odds, bound and determined to make a difference in someone else's life, even if that someone isn't seeking change (well, at first anyways). In doing so, he changes that person today, and for generations to come. Coach Carter is raw at times, and might not be as good as other that I've mention; however, it's a story well told, and I did enjoy it.[...]",3,Worth seeing.....,1114041600,"04 21, 2005",2005,2857,"['Coach', 'Carter', 'MTV', 'feature', 'film', 'production', 'film', 'Samuel', 'L.', 'Jackson', 'true', 'story', 'Coach', 'Ken', 'Carter', 'Richmond', 'High', 'School', 'inner', 'city', 'Los', 'Angeles', 'California.Carter', 'self-made', 'man', 'strict', 'disciplinarian', 'owner', 'own', 'Sporting', 'Goods', 'Store', 'film', 'Carter', 'returned', 'old', 'alma', 'mater', 'watch', 'basketball', 'game', 'St.', 'Joseph', 'High', 'School', 'son', 'attending', 'Prior', 'game', 'Coach', 'Carter', 'already', 'been', 'approached', 'school', 'current', 'coach', 'take', 'over', 'team.Richmond', 'severely', 'thrashed', 'undisciplined', 'cocky', 'unruly', 'Carter', 'coaching', 'position', 'however', 'be', 'terms', 'Richmond', 'had', 'only', 'won', '4', 'total', 'games', 'previously', 'year', 'Coach', 'Carter', 'was', 'afforded', 'request.Carter', 'required', 'players', 'sign', 'contract', 'could', 'play', 'ball', 'contract', 'required', 'player', 'maintain', '2.3', 'G.P.A.', 'attend', 'scheduled', 'classes', 'sit', 'front', 'row', 'classes', 'attended', 'required', 'Progress', 'Reports', 'teachers', 'documenting', 'player', 'academics', 'also', 'required', 'player', 'dress', 'appropriately', 'Game', 'Day', 'Tie', 'Coat', 'promoted', 'respect', 'team', 'respect', 'oneself.Prior', 'season', 'start', 'one', 'even', 'knew', 'who', 'where', 'Richmond', 'High', 'School', 'was', 'rigorous', 'practices', 'forced', 'discipline', 'strict', 'guidance', 'carter', 'turned', 'winners', 'however', 'where', 'trouble', 'started.Winning', 'was', 'easy', 'Carter', 'had', 'plan', 'team', 'executed', 'superbly', 'However', 'Carter', 'wanted', 'more', 'players', 'wanted', 'hope', 'desire', 'ability', 'lift', 'life', 'were', 'headed', 'wanted', 'players', 'have', 'ability', 'attended', 'college', 'could', 'only', 'happen', 'grades', 'were', 'good', 'enough.However', 'Richmond', 'H.S', 'only', '33', '%', 'seniors', 'over', '60', '%', 'are', 'female', 'Carter', 'explained', 'player', 'stood', 'better', 'chance', 'going', 'Jail', 'college', 'Progress', 'Reports', 'were', 'published', 'six', 'players', 'were', 'failing', 'least', 'one', 'more', 'classes', 'So', 'Carter', '16-0', 'undefeated', 'headed', 'state', 'championships', 'locked', 'gym', 'doors', 'started', 'forfeiting', 'games', 'turning', 'basketball', 'practice', 'sessions', 'tutoring', 'lessons', 'players', 'when', 'sh', '@', 'hit', 'proverbial', 'fan', 'semblance', 'Stand', 'Deliver', 'Remember', 'Titans', 'Hoosiers', 'Coach', 'Carter', 'story', 'one', 'man', 'insurmountable', 'odds', 'bound', 'determined', 'make', 'difference', 'someone', 'else', 'life', 'even', 'someone', ""n't"", 'seeking', 'change', 'well', 'first', 'anyways', 'doing', 'so', 'person', 'today', 'generations', 'come', 'Coach', 'Carter', 'raw', 'times', 'might', 'not', 'be', 'as', 'good', 'other', ""'ve"", 'mention', 'however', 'story', 'well', 'told', 'did', 'enjoy', 'it.', '[', ']']",N/A

Coach Carter, whose real life story and those of his players the film recounts, has a vision (and the fortitude to carry it out), of high school basketball that does not sacrifice, in the name of high sports achievement, the academic grades, college/university aspirations, and better lives in adulthood for which his young player players also should be striving after high school is over.Those were realistic goals and reasonable hopes back in 2005, when this film was released. Since then, due to the ongoing (as of 2014 as I write this) collapse of the U.S. economy that set in during 2007-2008, largely due to years of off-shoring American jobs (industrial, office, technical, and much professional work alike) and to the collusion of the cynical financiers of Wall Street and the corrupt U.S. government, such hopes have waned and higher education seems mostly nowadays to leave the young with crushing student debt to pay off without the job prospects that once had been there for graduates to seize hold of. However, this film also, from the educational standpoint, is about staying through high school to graduation with decent marks, and that, at least, would help to prepare American workers for so many of the more menial jobs that are left in the wrecked U.S. economy after the devastations that ""Free Trade"" policies have inflicted upon the labour market and, also, of the further financial ruin that has set in from 2008 onwards.However, how it was in 2005, in so many essential ways, is what the world really should be like and what the promise that civilised life, indeed, should hold! In the film, all of the sportsmen, the coach and his young basketball team members alike, who are struggling to live out Coach Carter's work ethic, are in and of Richmond, a ""disadvantaged town of mixed black, chicano, and some white population, in Northern California's Bay (Greater San Francisco) area, rather like the Southeast Los Angeles (Bell, Southgate, Watts) area of part of my own childhood, further south in the same state.The music is excellent, too, hot and energetic, as the kids like it, expertly crafted and delivered.

Bala ""Me Too Can Read""","[2, 2]","This film, based on the real life accomplishments of Coach Ken Carter and his Richmond high school basketball team in 1999, makes a telling point about our inner city school system, which is steadily losing students to the temptations and easy alternatives of the street life. When Coach Carter boycotted his team from playing basketball due to low grades, the parents and the school board and staff withheld their support. A lot of them even actively opposed him. What does that say about our society when basketball has become more important than educating our kids? In the shoes of the parents, mired in a hopeless, embattled way of life, trapped in economic hell and without much to look forward to except for an NBA contract, I'm not sure whose side I would've picked. With an undefeated team to rally the community, with kids showing up at school, even it it's just to play ball, with an awareness that reaching for your dreams is unrealistic and too costly, the Richmond populace labeled Coach Carter more as a controversial troublemaker than a visionary with an eye on the big picture.Coach Carter tells the story of Ken Carter, who came to coach the down-and-out high school basketball team of Richmond, California, where he was an all-star player 30 years ago, setting records for scoring, assists, and steals. Already a successful shopowner, Carter took the job with more in mind than merely winning basketball games. He made his angry and undisciplined players each sign a contract stating that they must maintain a 2.3 grade school average, show up in classes, sit at the head of these classes, and wear a button shirt, tie, and jacket on game day. Thru strenuous workouts, drills, and game practices, Coach Carter taught his kids the art of teamwork and instilled in them a sense of worth and confidence. From a prior year's record of 4-22, the Richmond Oilers improved to an undefeated 16-0 before Carter finally got his hands on his kids' school progress reports (yes, it took 16 games before the uncooperative teachers began turning them in). When these reports revealed that the players haven't lived up to their contracts, Coach Carter closed down all basketball activities. Refusing to compromise, despite the outcry from the Richmond community, Coach Carter forfeited the next few games. Only should the student-athletes improve their academics satisfactorily will they be able to compete in hoops again.This movie may be overlong at 136 minutes, but it's still an outstanding, energetic movie with a contemporary message. Samuel L. Jackson's presence, as always, demands your attention. The film is anchored by his commanding performance, as well as by some sincere acting efforts put out by the kids, with Rick Gonzalez (The Rookie, Pulse) particularly memorable as Timo Cruz, who more than any of the other kids, seems headed down the wrong road. R&B; star Ashanti fares pretty well in a sensitively portrayed pregnancy subplot. Yeah, the script is hokey and rife with cliched inspirational speeches, but, because it's mostly Samuel Jackson selling them, we buy the hokum. The only really, really cheesy part has to do with Timo's ""greatest fear"" poetry recital to Coach Carter, which is worthy of massive eye rolling. One thing I wish the movie has more of are father-and-son scenes between Coach Carter and his son Damien, who plays for him. On the athletic side, the basketball sequences are shot effectively, with some moments of excitement. The cast, having gone thru 3 weeks of basketball camp, is convincing enough as hoopsters. The thing is, the majority of the movie goers is already aware that the Oilers were undefeated going into the lockout, so the only actual suspense to a game's outcome was in the post-lockout contests, especially the game versus St. Francis.The dvd is not what you'd call loaded though it boasts two featurettes ""Coach Carter: The Man Behind the Movie"" and ""Fast Break at Richmond High"" (about the rigorous hoops training undergone by the actors and extras), 6 deleted scenes, and the cool music video ""Hope"" by Twista and Faith Evans.I'm usually not into message movies, especially movies that pound their social commentary down your throat. But, when it's social commentary this entertaining, it's well worth checking out.

The film was a little corny and syrupy from time to time but it was an overall good, positive film. I have read and heard so many comments about the morals and unacceptable behavior portrayed by some of the characters and in turn viewers bad-mouth the film simply because they do not agree with some of the behavior of the some of the characters in the film. But these people obviously missed the point of the film. Coach Carter was trying to instill values that he thought would help an entire community. The reality is that kids do have foul mouths, have unprotected sex, are faced with hard decisions (to have or not have a baby and selling drugs) everyday.There are many movies similar in plot and theme to Coach Carter but this movie stands well on it's own. Most of the credit for that has to go to the star, Samuel L. Jackson. They could not have found a better man to play this role. I do not know much about the coach this movie is based on, but I can not imagine anything better or stronger than what Jackson has given us here.The story is pretty much like any other. A former basketball star from the early 70's is asked to coach this year's team due to the fact that the old coach is not able to keep the kids focused on their grades, coming to class, etc. Where this movie differs, and what makes this better than most movies of this type, is the depth it goes into in most of the players on the team. The bigger stars have their own back stories and reasons for why they are the way they are.Obviously, judging the acting, Samuel L. Jackson is head and shoulders above the rest but others who stand out here are Rick Gonzalez, Antwon Tanner and Robert Richard. Each of these guys played their characters to a tee.

632706,ALLJT7S5QOFFZ,B00005JNNZ,kaduzy,"[3, 3]","This movie is based on a true story, but unlike most films which start off with that statement, this one doesn't need much ""artistic liscence"" to make it into a perfect Hollywood fairytale.  And that's because the true story of Coach Frank Carter and the Richmond Oilers stands on its own as a testament to the possibilities within all of us and the power of believing in yourself.That sounds cheesy but the film does not deliver this message in a cheesy or preachy way (for the most part).  Instead, it focuses on character and very action-packed sports sequences to tell its story, and it succeeds.Frank Carter is played by Samuel L. Jackson, who doesn't have to do much out of the ordinary to capture the grit and determination of this character.  His performance is excellent, as one would obviously expect from such a talented actor.  More noteworthy are the young men who play his players.  Each of them captures their character realistically and effectively and their performances are the heart and soul of this film.  Also noteworthy is singer Ashanti, making her film debut in a role she plays very well, and it isn't made flashier just because of her presence in it.The story doesn't end the way you'd expect it to in a movie -- it ends realistically instead.  In the end, integrity, along with the value of academic achievement over athletic achievement, are the morals of the story, not winning.  This is truly something that Hollywood should emphasize more often!The extras on this DVD are very good too, which is equally as refreshing and surprising!  One documentary introduces us to the real Frank Carter, who almost seems like a disappointment in a funny way since Jackson's performance is a lot more intense than the man himself is.  But he has obviously made such a great impact on his players and his community that there must be more to him than meets the eye.  One only wishes the documentary were longer, and explored more of the connections between the actual players and the actors who portrayed them on screen.A second documentary talks about the making of the movie itself, with emphasis on choreographing and executing the basketball scenes in a realistic way.  After watching this, it's clear why they succeeded in making these scenes so exciting to watch.  It does get a bit technical at times, however, which may be a bit dull for people who aren't very well versed in basketball and computer terminology.The one major drawback of the DVD extras is that we are NEVER introduced to the movie's director.  I don't know whether he's camera shy or simply didn't take a very large hand in actually making the movie, but he's nowhere to be seen on ANY of the featurettes.  I was particularly disappinted by this because the director's last name is also Carter, and I kept wondering if he had any relationship to the real Coach Carter.Overall, this movie is very satisfying and very uplifting.  I would recommend it to anyone as an entertaining film, but I think it should be REQUIRED VIEWING for ALL high school athletes who come from impovrished inner-city areas.

632709,A27H9DOUGY9FOS,B00005JNNZ,"K. Harris ""Film aficionado""","[1, 1]","Oh, the sports movie.  The underdog victorious.  There are lots of cliches in film, but nothing quite compares to the formulaic telling of the inspirational, crowd-pleasing sports story.  Having seen two recent films set in the world of competitive basketball--I've realized the ""game"" is not always the thing.  While generally these films can build tension with slow motion photography and good music montages, it's a rare movie that can overcome its limitations to really stand apart from the dozens of similar stories.""Coach Carter"" tells the true life story of Ken Carter, a high school coach who emphasized academics over basketball.  By valuing the educational system, this is a nice example of a man who wanted to help develop well-rounded and successful young men.  As you may expect, you've got the requisite ""types"" on the team--but what stands apart is the tough, compassionate, and accomplished performance of Samuel L. Jackson.  Maybe heavy handed at times, ""Coach Carter"" dares to tell a basketball story where basketball is just one component of success in the life of the players.  This was a controversial man, in his time, because he dared to shut down a successful team for something more important--and that's a fine message in what becomes a powerful film.""Glory Road,"" of course, tells (arguably) a more significant story.  The plot depicted here, about racism and integration of college sports, had serious repercussions to the development of the athletic arena as it now exists.  But, ultimately, I felt singularly less connected to this film from an emotional standpoint.  Don Haskins, played by Josh Lucas, was hired as head coach by Texas Western University.  With no budget for recruitment, he traveled the United States and ending up assembling a team consisting largely of black players.  Here, academics are only giving passing mention--basketball is the thing.  The first half of the picture is full of mildly racial banter between the local players and the new recruits--it's almost perpetuating it's own stereotype.  And the last half is composed of more overt acts of racism.  But neither half is done in a particularly realistic or involving way, it's a paint by numbers portrait of a difficult topic.Between the two films, I definitely feel as if ""Coach Carter"" spent more time in character development--and ultimately I think that's why it's more effective.  I felt as if Jackson let me know the man and his motivations, so that his interactions with his family and team became relevant (even if all the characters were not fully fleshed out).  Lucas, on the other hand, was left considerably less developed by his script--and the film falters for this.  For example, we know nothing of substance about his wife and, following the first 10 minutes of the film, he seems to completely neglect his own kids.  Hence, ""Glory Road"" becomes all surface and little depth.But this lack of adequate character development has larger implications because sports movies ask you to get caught up in the games.  While ""Glory Road"" has one of the most significant upsets in basketball history depicted--it's game is genuinely less involving that the final contest of ""Coach Carter.""  Why?  Because ""Carter"" has earned our emotional involvement.  ""Glory Road"" just expects it.I'm scoring ""Coach Carter"" at a solid 4 stars.  Great performances and a good message rank this a cut above.  ""Glory Road"" is about 2 1/2 stars.  Adequate performances in a weaker script and an underdeveloped, but important message, keep this one grounded.

632710,A6ADO7B6FUVN,B00005JNNZ,"Kim Anehall ""www.cinematica.org""","[2, 2]","Every other year a film comes out that deals with the importance of academics that send the message - stay in school.  Coach Carter is exactly one of these films, however, it also deals with the importance of athletics in the perspective of continual growth of young adults that cross the bridge of adolescence into adulthood.  Having this in mind, a question seems to surface that questions whether the audience needs more films that carry this message across to the audience.  In this case, the answer should be a resolute yes that should echo through the many high schools throughout the United States.  Many adolescents find themselves at a puzzled crossroads in their lives and this film could help by being one of the many sources that offer some guidance to the teen viewers.The fascination with Coach Carter rests within Samuel L. Jackson's character Coach Carter who unyieldingly enforces his law on the student athletes at Richmond High School.  When Coach Carter arrives at Richmond HS, he discovers that the discipline, academics, and athletic performance do not stand high with the students who more or less seem to run the school.  However, Coach Carter does not tolerate mediocrity in any aspect of being a basketball player on the Richmond Oilers, as he hands over a contract for the players to sign at the first meeting with the players.  The contract states that they have to maintain a 2.3 grade point average, wear a shirt and tie on game days, and sit in front of the class.  Several people, players and parents, believe that Coach Carter is out of line by enforcing his rules on the players.  But Coach Carter remains firm with his coaching philosophy, as he merely states, ""These boys are student athletes. ""Student"" comes first.""Nonetheless, Coach Carter faces a long road head of him, which begins with one victory after another.  Through the victories he begins to teach the players that hard work will eventually pay off, but he also coaches them about character and other worthwhile lessons that will be helpful throughout life.  On the academic side of the issue, Coach Carter discovers a strong resistance among the teachers and the faculty at Richmond HS.  They do not provide him with the progress reports that he needs to check on how the students uphold their contract by having a 2.3 grade point average.  Years of battling poor academics at Richmond HS seem to have sunken into the mentality of the teachers and faculty that these students cannot do better.  This is something Coach Carter finds unacceptable, as he deals with the problem directly by challenging the system.Finally, when Coach Carter receives the progress reports after much trouble he finds out that several of the players are either failing or have incompletes in their classes.  Consequently, he cancels the practices and forfeits the games until the players will have increased their grade point average, and they uphold their contract.  This however causes much disturbance among teachers, faculty, and parents who find that the students, who are unbeaten at the time are losing games due to forfeits, which could harm their chances of going to the State Championship.Besides dealing with academics and athletics, the film presents several interesting side plots through issues such as teen pregnancy, poverty, gangs, and drugs.  This portrays an authentic image of the real problems that teens face, yet these issues all get an obvious solution that might not feel true.  However, many young viewers can probably relate to the issues, and thus it makes it a powerful teaching tool, as they all deal with their own problems in their own way.Coach Carter has its cinematic blemishes, which the audience should overlook when observing the message that the film tries to send to a most likely young audience.  For whatever reason the audience sees the film, they get to experience a positive message that displays several lessons such as perseverance, diligence, and teamwork.  In this light, one must consider the film to be a rather good film, even though some scenes have some awkwardness.  However, despite some of the cinematic gracelessness, Coach Carter delivers what he teaches-the message of diligently pursing ones own dreams so the inner winner will emerge.",4,Diligently Pursue Your Dreams and the Winner Will Emerge...,1118793600,"06 15, 2005",2005,4273,"['other', 'year', 'film', 'out', 'deals', 'importance', 'academics', 'send', 'message', 'stay', 'school', 'Coach', 'Carter', 'exactly', 'one', 'films', 'however', 'also', 'importance', 'athletics', 'perspective', 'continual', 'growth', 'young', 'adults', 'cross', 'bridge', 'adolescence', 'adulthood', 'Having', 'mind', 'question', 'surface', 'questions', 'audience', 'more', 'films', 'carry', 'message', 'audience', 'case', 'answer', 'should', 'be', 'resolute', 'yes', 'should', 'echo', 'many', 'high', 'schools', 'United', 'States', 'Many', 'adolescents', 'find', 'puzzled', 'crossroads', 'lives', 'film', 'could', 'help', 'being', 'one', 'many', 'sources', 'offer', 'guidance', 'teen', 'viewers.The', 'fascination', 'Coach', 'Carter', 'Samuel', 'L.', 'Jackson', 'character', 'Coach', 'Carter', 'who', 'unyieldingly', 'law', 'student', 'Richmond', 'High', 'School', 'When', 'Coach', 'Carter', 'Richmond', 'HS', 'discipline', 'academics', 'athletic', 'performance', 'do', 'not', 'stand', 'high', 'students', 'who', 'more', 'less', 'seem', 'run', 'school', 'However', 'Coach', 'Carter', 'not', 'tolerate', 'mediocrity', 'aspect', 'being', 'basketball', 'player', 'Richmond', 'Oilers', 'contract', 'players', 'sign', 'first', 'meeting', 'players', 'contract', 'have', 'maintain', '2.3', 'grade', 'point', 'average', 'wear', 'shirt', 'tie', 'game', 'days', 'sit', 'front', 'class', 'Several', 'people', 'players', 'parents', 'believe', 'Coach', 'Carter', 'line', 'enforcing', 'rules', 'players', 'Coach', 'Carter', 'firm', 'coaching', 'philosophy', 'merely', 'boys', 'are', 'student', 'athletes', 'Student', 'first', 'Nonetheless', 'Coach', 'Carter', 'long', 'road', 'head', 'one', 'victory', 'victories', 'teach', 'players', 'hard', 'work', 'will', 'eventually', 'pay', 'off', 'also', 'character', 'other', 'worthwhile', 'lessons', 'will', 'be', 'helpful', 'life', 'academic', 'side', 'issue', 'Coach', 'Carter', 'strong', 'resistance', 'teachers', 'faculty', 'Richmond', 'HS', 'do', 'not', 'provide', 'progress', 'reports', 'check', 'how', 'students', 'uphold', 'contract', 'having', '2.3', 'grade', 'point', 'average', 'Years', 'battling', 'poor', 'academics', 'Richmond', 'HS', 'seem', 'have', 'sunken', 'mentality', 'teachers', 'faculty', 'students', 'can', 'not', 'do', 'better', 'something', 'Coach', 'Carter', 'unacceptable', 'problem', 'directly', 'challenging', 'system.Finally', 'when', 'Coach', 'Carter', 'progress', 'reports', 'much', 'trouble', 'out', 'several', 'players', 'are', 'failing', 'have', 'incompletes', 'classes', 'Consequently', 'practices', 'games', 'players', 'will', 'have', 'increased', 'grade', 'point', 'average', 'uphold', 'contract', 'however', 'much', 'disturbance', 'teachers', 'faculty', 'parents', 'who', 'find', 'students', 'who', 'are', 'unbeaten', 'time', 'are', 'losing', 'games', 'due', 'forfeits', 'could', 'harm', 'chances', 'going', 'State', 'Championship.Besides', 'dealing', 'academics', 'athletics', 'film', 'several', 'interesting', 'side', 'plots', 'issues', 'such', 'teen', 'pregnancy', 'poverty', 'gangs', 'drugs', 'authentic', 'image', 'real', 'problems', 'face', 'yet', 'issues', 'get', 'obvious', 'solution', 'might', 'not', 'feel', 'true', 'However', 'many', 'young', 'viewers', 'can', 'probably', 'relate', 'issues', 'thus', 'powerful', 'teaching', 'tool', 'deal', 'own', 'problems', 'own', 'way.Coach', 'Carter', 'cinematic', 'blemishes', 'audience', 'should', 'overlook', 'when', 'observing', 'message', 'film', 'send', 'most', 'likely', 'young', 'audience', 'reason', 'audience', 'film', 'get', 'experience', 'positive', 'message', 'several', 'lessons', 'such', 'perseverance', 'diligence', 'teamwork', 'light', 'one', 'must', 'consider', 'film', 'be', 'rather', 'good', 'film', 'even', 'scenes', 'have', 'awkwardness', 'However', 'cinematic', 'gracelessness', 'Coach', 'Carter', 'what', 'teaches-the', 'message', 'diligently', 'pursing', 'ones', 'own', 'dreams', 'inner', 'winner', 'will', 'emerge']",N/A

632712,A2FGVU0XEWW1OF,B00005JNNZ,Kristin Dreyer Kramer,"[2, 3]","This inspirational sports movie is a little bit Hoosiers and a little bit Dangerous Minds.  It tells the true story of Ken Carter (Samuel L. Jackson), a former high school basketball star who returns to his alma mater, Richmond (CA) High School, to coach the struggling basketball team.  From the beginning, Coach Carter has high hopes for his team.  He makes players sign contracts, promising to be great students as well as great athletes-intending to help them break out of the school's high drop-out rates and low college acceptance rates.On the court, the team excels beyond anyone's expectations, and the team wins game after game.  But then the academic reports come in-and Carter realizes that several of his students aren't keeping up the academic end of the deal.  In a move that's highly unpopular with students, parents, and even the school board, Carter forces his team to meet in the library instead of the gym.  He cancels practices and games until the whole team is back to the standards that he expects of his players-even though the board threatens to go over his head and cut the chains that keep the gym closed.Coach Carter is a compelling film about a man who devoted himself to improving the future of his community-not just to winning the game.  Though it definitely isn't the kind of movie that I typically enjoy, I enjoyed it.  It's fast-paced and action-packed, but it's also moving at the same time.  Anyone who loves basketball won't want to miss the perfectly-choreographed game scenes-though they may seem a bit long for non-hoops-fans.  It's not just for sports fans, though-the story is a powerful one for anyone.

632714,A1L43KWWR05PCS,B00005JNNZ,Lawyeraau,"[2, 2]","When my daughter came over to visit, she suggested that we rent this film. Since it stars Samuel L. Jackson and is about a high school basketball coach, I thought that it sounded promising. Well, it turned to be more than just promising. It is a movie that held me riveted to the screen the entire time it was on. Samuel L. Jackson is simply outstanding in the role of a high school coach who sees basketball as the means to an end and not the end itself.Based upon a true story that took place in Richmond, California, it centers on a man named Ken Carter. He was asked by the retiring basketball coach of Richmond High School to return as a part-time basketball coach to the school from which Ken had graduated and left his mark many years earlier. The school is one of those schools in which people barely graduate and, of those that do, most do not go on to college. The basketball team was no great shakes either, having won only four games in the entire previous year.Finally, Carter is prevailed upon to take over as coach. He has, however, decided that he wants to make a difference. He starts off by letting the team know who is boss and by trying to instill discipline and respect. He wants to go back to fundamentals. He wants to put the emphasis on being a student athlete. To this end, he makes it clear just what his expectations are. He drafts a contract that those who wish to remain on the team, as well as their parent, must sign. Some of the conditions are that the players must attend class, do their schoolwork, and pass their classes. Those who signed the contract ended up making the best move of their lives.Coach Carter keeps his side of the bargain, turning the team into a formidable one on the court. Suddenly, basketball at Richmond High School begins commanding attention. Notwithstanding this, he still emphasizes that they are to be just as committed to their studies. While one might expect some resistance from the student athletes to such a change, one would expect support from the educators themselves. What is amazing is the resistance that he experiences from the teaching community who are reluctant to give him progress reports on how his players were doing academically.When Coach Carter finally gets his long awaited progress reports and discovers that some of his student athletes are not holding up their end of the contract, all hell breaks loose. Even though they have had an undefeated season so far, he basically locks the gym and tells his players that there will be no more basketball, until he sees some academic improvement. To his surprise, the school board, as well as the parents, does not support him in this matter, and the situation becomes a media sensation on the West Coast. Support comes from an unexpected source, the student athletes themselves.This is a heartwarming story about a coach who cared and dared to make a difference in the lives of kids that had little or no future. What he did for those students was incomparable, as he basically gave them a chance for a better life. Samuel L. Jackson is sensational as Coach Carter, dynamic and totally believable in the role. The young men who play his student athletes likewise give excellent performances. Ashanti also gives a surprisingly well nuanced performance as the girlfriend of one of the student athletes. Moreover, for those who enjoy great basketball, the on court scenes are extremely well done.At the end of the film, there is a summary of what happened to these young men. When the viewer sees what happened to them, the viewer cannot help be but touched by the turn of events. This is a very well acted, deftly directed, inspirational film and one that is worthy of being in one's personal collection.",5,INSPIRATIONAL SPORT MOVIE...,1150934400,"06 22, 2006",2006,3734,"['When', 'daughter', 'came', 'visit', 'suggested', 'rent', 'film', 'Samuel', 'L.', 'Jackson', 'high', 'school', 'basketball', 'coach', 'thought', 'sounded', 'promising', 'Well', 'turned', 'be', 'more', 'just', 'promising', 'movie', 'held', 'riveted', 'screen', 'entire', 'time', 'was', 'Samuel', 'L.', 'Jackson', 'simply', 'outstanding', 'role', 'high', 'school', 'coach', 'who', 'basketball', 'means', 'end', 'not', 'end', 'itself.Based', 'true', 'story', 'took', 'place', 'Richmond', 'California', 'man', 'named', 'Ken', 'Carter', 'was', 'asked', 'retiring', 'basketball', 'coach', 'Richmond', 'High', 'School', 'return', 'part-time', 'basketball', 'coach', 'school', 'Ken', 'had', 'graduated', 'left', 'mark', 'many', 'years', 'earlier', 'school', 'one', 'schools', 'people', 'barely', 'graduate', 'do', 'most', 'do', 'not', 'go', 'college', 'basketball', 'team', 'was', 'great', 'shakes', 'either', 'having', 'won', 'only', 'four', 'games', 'entire', 'previous', 'year.Finally', 'Carter', 'prevailed', 'take', 'over', 'coach', 'however', 'decided', 'make', 'difference', 'off', 'letting', 'team', 'know', 'who', 'boss', 'trying', 'instill', 'discipline', 'respect', 'go', 'back', 'fundamentals', 'put', 'emphasis', 'being', 'student', 'athlete', 'end', 'clear', 'just', 'what', 'expectations', 'are', 'contract', 'who', 'wish', 'remain', 'team', 'as', 'well', 'parent', 'must', 'sign', 'conditions', 'are', 'players', 'must', 'attend', 'class', 'do', 'schoolwork', 'pass', 'classes', 'who', 'signed', 'contract', 'ended', 'up', 'making', 'best', 'move', 'lives.Coach', 'Carter', 'side', 'bargain', 'turning', 'team', 'formidable', 'one', 'court', 'Suddenly', 'basketball', 'Richmond', 'High', 'School', 'commanding', 'attention', 'Notwithstanding', 'still', 'are', 'be', 'just', 'as', 'committed', 'studies', 'one', 'might', 'expect', 'resistance', 'student', 'such', 'change', 'one', 'would', 'expect', 'support', 'educators', 'What', 'amazing', 'resistance', 'teaching', 'community', 'who', 'are', 'reluctant', 'give', 'progress', 'reports', 'how', 'players', 'were', 'doing', 'academically.When', 'Coach', 'Carter', 'finally', 'long', 'awaited', 'progress', 'reports', 'discovers', 'student', 'athletes', 'are', 'not', 'holding', 'up', 'end', 'contract', 'hell', 'breaks', 'loose', 'Even', 'have', 'had', 'undefeated', 'season', 'so', 'far', 'basically', 'gym', 'tells', 'players', 'will', 'be', 'no', 'more', 'basketball', 'academic', 'improvement', 'surprise', 'school', 'board', 'as', 'well', 'parents', 'not', 'support', 'matter', 'situation', 'media', 'sensation', 'West', 'Coast', 'Support', 'unexpected', 'source', 'student', 'heartwarming', 'story', 'coach', 'who', 'cared', 'dared', 'make', 'difference', 'lives', 'kids', 'had', 'little', 'future', 'What', 'did', 'students', 'was', 'incomparable', 'basically', 'gave', 'chance', 'better', 'life', 'Samuel', 'L.', 'Jackson', 'sensational', 'Coach', 'Carter', 'dynamic', 'totally', 'believable', 'role', 'young', 'men', 'who', 'play', 'student', 'athletes', 'likewise', 'give', 'excellent', 'performances', 'Ashanti', 'also', 'surprisingly', 'well', 'nuanced', 'performance', 'girlfriend', 'one', 'student', 'Moreover', 'who', 'enjoy', 'great', 'basketball', 'court', 'scenes', 'are', 'extremely', 'well', 'done.At', 'end', 'film', 'summary', 'what', 'happened', 'young', 'men', 'When', 'viewer', 'what', 'happened', 'viewer', 'can', 'not', 'help', 'be', 'touched', 'turn', 'events', 'very', 'well', 'acted', 'deftly', 'directed', 'inspirational', 'film', 'one', 'worthy', 'being', 'one', 'personal', 'collection']",N/A

Jackson is one of our great actors, and he carries this film in much the same way that the real Ken Carter carried the Richmond High School team to their dreams.I see many reviews that complain that ""all that school stuff"" gets in the way of an otherwise good movie.  They miss the point.Ken Carter understands all too well (as is brought home in the film) that EXTREMELY few of the inner-city athletes are going to go on to fame and fortune in the nba(or any other professional league).  For those who don't become the next Lebron James life becomes a series of tough choices if you don't have ""that school stuff"" behind you.  Dead end job or life of crime?  High School drop outs (about 2/3 of the males in Richmond we're told in the movie) don't have good life or career choices.As an editorial comment: Something the film doesn't even start to address are those young ""star"" athletes who do ""make it"" - they have the skills to get to a professional league, then  sabotage themselves by resorting to behaviors they learned back in their neighborhoods while they weren't learning things like English - to allow them to speak to reporters and become product spokesmen, or Math - to allow them to track their money rather than relying on some smooth-talking Ivy Leaguer who takes control of their new fortunes. Or perhaps they can't help themselves from dabbling in drugs.... or guns.... Coach Carter's lessons would be an asset to pretty much all Americans.But I digress.  The point of ""Coach Carter"" is that our hero recognizes that things like hard work, education and character are the ONLY things that are going to separate the vast majority of his players from a life of promise and a life going nowhere.  We can only IMAGINE what the real Coach Carter thought when his attempts to instill these values into his players were met with resistance: not surprisingly from the players themselves, but also from their parents and, worst of all, from the school board as well.There are some exciting, fast-paced and well-played sequences in the film.  There are also moments when we get to see character being developed - or on display after it has been developed.  A documentary included on the is as encouraging as the film itself: we see players from that team 5 years later and they tell ""where they are now"".  One is in the ABA and the rest are in college.  Two of them have plans to become Doctors.  I don't know where Darryl Dawkins is now, but I'm guessing somewhere other than medical school.We're told that the year before Coach Carter arrived Richmond went 4 - 22.  I would argue that this story would be almost as remarkable if he had coached a team that ALSO lost 22 games.  The fact that he turned them into winners on AND off the court is all the more remarkable.  The fact that he did it for a part-time stipend of $1,500 salary is a noble achievement.It's encouraging to see characters in stand up for principles, even moreso in the face of adversity.  It's even more encouraging to see them do it for the benefit of others and for their community.The real Coach Carter provides a good story and great example, and the film ""Coach Carter"" does a good job of bringing us that story.

632726,A2VEB9Z1W5DD4C,B00005JNNZ,M. Newton,"[4, 4]","Coach Carter tells a great story and provokes a lot of thought about why some cultures consistently fail.  The film itself was good, but given the subject matter, it could have been a 5 star film.Samuel Jackson is very convincing in his role, and the young men who act as his players are well cast.  This film had a lot in common with Hoosiers, which is the best basketball film ever made.  Like Hoosiers, you have an inspiring story with twists and turns.  How you feel about the movie beyond that depends on what your personal preferences are.  If you like basketball (unlike the Amazon.com official review shown above), you will enjoy the well-choreographed basketball sequences.  If you are in to rap music, you may like the soundtrack.  My problem with the film is that I'm not a big rap music fan.  Also, I don't feel the need to hear profane ghetto talk thoughout some of the movie.  The movie seemed to be aimed at young rapsters, which is fine. Since I'm not a young rapster, I didn't enjoy some aspects of the movie.  Nonetheless, this was a good movie over all.This was not a movie for those under 13, as the rating indicates.  The language is poor, there are some sexual scenes, and the abortion issue (a distraction to the film) is present.The movie does bring up the question of why some cultures fail.  I liked the fact that this film made it a cultural issue instead of a race issue by having various races on the team and at the school.  We see that some cultures simply don't understand that academics are required to get ahead in the modern world.  This total lack of an educational emphasis keeps some groups behind, even if there is no racism.  The ray of hope is Coach Carter.  He refuses to believe that his kids can't do it.  He chooses to believe that the kids can do it and that he, one man, can make a major difference.  This segment of the story is so inspiring that I wish this film could be shown to all ages.  However, maybe the message will reach young men and women who can still make a difference in their own lives.  History has shown that individuals from poor cultures can make choices that lead them to become successful, regardless of the obstacles.The DVD has a story on the real Coach Carter that is worth a look.",4,"Good movie, Great story.",1121126400,"07 12, 2005",2005,2254,"['Coach', 'Carter', 'great', 'story', 'lot', 'thought', 'why', 'cultures', 'consistently', 'fail', 'film', 'was', 'good', 'given', 'subject', 'matter', 'could', 'have', 'been', '5', 'star', 'film.Samuel', 'Jackson', 'very', 'convincing', 'role', 'young', 'men', 'who', 'act', 'players', 'are', 'well', 'cast', 'film', 'had', 'lot', 'common', 'Hoosiers', 'best', 'basketball', 'film', 'ever', 'made', 'Hoosiers', 'have', 'inspiring', 'story', 'twists', 'turns', 'How', 'feel', 'movie', 'what', 'personal', 'preferences', 'are', 'like', 'Amazon.com', 'official', 'review', 'shown', 'will', 'enjoy', 'well-choreographed', 'basketball', 'sequences', 'are', 'rap', 'music', 'may', 'like', 'soundtrack', 'problem', 'film', ""'m"", 'not', 'big', 'rap', 'music', 'fan', 'Also', 'do', ""n't"", 'feel', 'need', 'hear', 'profane', 'ghetto', 'talk', 'movie', 'movie', 'seemed', 'be', 'aimed', 'young', 'rapsters', 'fine', ""'m"", 'not', 'young', 'rapster', 'did', ""n't"", 'enjoy', 'aspects', 'movie', 'Nonetheless', 'was', 'good', 'movie', 'all.This', 'was', 'not', 'movie', '13', 'rating', 'language', 'poor', 'are', 'sexual', 'scenes', 'abortion', 'issue', 'distraction', 'film', 'present.The', 'movie', 'bring', 'up', 'question', 'why', 'cultures', 'fail', 'liked', 'fact', 'film', 'made', 'cultural', 'issue', 'instead', 'race', 'issue', 'having', 'various', 'races', 'team', 'school', 'see', 'cultures', 'simply', 'do', ""n't"", 'understand', 'academics', 'are', 'required', 'get', 'ahead', 'modern', 'world', 'total', 'lack', 'educational', 'emphasis', 'groups', 'even', 'racism', 'ray', 'hope', 'Coach', 'Carter', 'believe', 'kids', 'ca', ""n't"", 'do', 'believe', 'kids', 'can', 'do', 'one', 'man', 'can', 'make', 'major', 'difference', 'segment', 'story', 'so', 'inspiring', 'wish', 'film', 'could', 'be', 'shown', 'ages', 'However', 'maybe', 'message', 'will', 'reach', 'young', 'men', 'women', 'who', 'can', 'still', 'make', 'difference', 'own', 'lives', 'History', 'shown', 'individuals', 'poor', 'cultures', 'can', 'make', 'choices', 'lead', 'become', 'successful', 'regardless', 'obstacles.The', 'DVD', 'story', 'real', 'Coach', 'Carter', 'look']",N/A

Kyle,"[2, 2]","In a world where winning is often secondary to almost everything and a lot of folks don't even stop to think of short- versus long-term wins, this story's about a man who dares to think a little bit differently.His name is Carter.  Back in the 70's, he was the star player for Riverside High.  He went on to college and now owns a sporting goods store in the old predominantly Black neighborhood, which isn't such a safe place anymore.When Carter is asked to coach his old school's losing basketball team, he accepts--but he sets higher standards for the players than the State requires.  The student-athletes must have a 2.3 GPA instead of a 2.0.  They must attend all of their classes and they must sit on the front row.  They must also wear ties to their games.Respect is the name of the game.  Carter stops the young men from using denegrating racial terms for each other,  demands they live up to their actions and their promises.  Do they win?  In a school where only half of the students graduate, 80% of the young Black males will probably end up in jail...yes, they win.Coach Carter confessed he didn't achieve his goals:  he started out to teach boys how to play basketball.  They turned to men.  He started out to teach them to win.  They became students.This film isn't just about basketball---I don't know a free-throw from a jump shot and I enjoyed this film.  When Coach Carter ordered the team to do 'suicides' I thought he literally meant it.  Okay, running non-stop from goal-line to goal-line and having to bend and touch those goal lines might just be suicide if you are out of shape like the team originally was. This film is about growing up and learning to use your full potential.  One of the best speeches from this film follows:""Our deepest fear is not that we are inadequate. Our deepest fear is that we are powerful beyond measure. It is our light, not our dark that most frightens us. Your playing small does not serve the world. There is nothing enlightened about shrinking so that other people don't feel insecure around you.We are all meant to shine as children do. Its not just in some of us; its in everyone. And as we let our own lights shine, we unconsiously give other people to do the same. As we are liberated from our own fear, our presence automatically liberates others.""",5,This movie will have you cheering RIVERSIDE even if you don't like basketball,1120348800,"07 3, 2005",2005,2313,"['world', 'where', 'winning', 'often', 'secondary', 'almost', 'everything', 'lot', 'folks', 'do', ""n't"", 'even', 'stop', 'think', 'short-', 'versus', 'long-term', 'wins', 'story', 'man', 'who', 'think', 'little', 'bit', 'differently.His', 'name', 'Carter', 'Back', '70', 'was', 'star', 'player', 'Riverside', 'High', 'went', 'college', 'now', 'sporting', 'goods', 'store', 'old', 'predominantly', 'Black', 'neighborhood', ""n't"", 'such', 'safe', 'place', 'anymore.When', 'Carter', 'asked', 'coach', 'old', 'school', 'losing', 'basketball', 'team', 'higher', 'standards', 'players', 'State', 'student-athletes', 'must', 'have', '2.3', 'GPA', 'instead', '2.0', 'must', 'attend', 'classes', 'must', 'sit', 'front', 'row', 'must', 'also', 'wear', 'ties', 'games.Respect', 'name', 'game', 'Carter', 'young', 'men', 'using', 'denegrating', 'racial', 'terms', 'other', 'live', 'up', 'actions', 'promises', 'Do', 'win', 'school', 'where', 'only', 'half', 'students', 'graduate', '80', '%', 'young', 'Black', 'males', 'will', 'probably', 'end', 'up', 'jail', 'yes', 'win.Coach', 'Carter', 'confessed', 'did', ""n't"", 'achieve', 'goals', 'started', 'out', 'teach', 'boys', 'how', 'play', 'basketball', 'turned', 'men', 'started', 'out', 'teach', 'win', 'became', 'students.This', 'film', ""n't"", 'just', 'basketball', '-I', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'free-throw', 'jump', 'shot', 'enjoyed', 'film', 'When', 'Coach', 'Carter', 'ordered', 'team', 'do', ""'suicides"", 'thought', 'literally', 'meant', 'Okay', 'running', 'non-stop', 'goal-line', 'goal-line', 'having', 'bend', 'touch', 'goal', 'lines', 'might', 'just', 'be', 'suicide', 'are', 'shape', 'team', 'originally', 'was', 'film', 'growing', 'up', 'learning', 'use', 'full', 'potential', 'One', 'best', 'speeches', 'film', 'deepest', 'fear', 'not', 'are', 'inadequate', 'deepest', 'fear', 'are', 'powerful', 'measure', 'light', 'not', 'dark', 'most', 'frightens', 'playing', 'small', 'not', 'serve', 'world', 'nothing', 'enlightened', 'shrinking', 'so', 'other', 'people', 'do', ""n't"", 'feel', 'insecure', 'you.We', 'are', 'meant', 'shine', 'children', 'do', 'not', 'just', 'everyone', 'let', 'own', 'lights', 'shine', 'unconsiously', 'give', 'other', 'people', 'do', 'same', 'are', 'liberated', 'own', 'fear', 'presence', 'automatically', 'others']",N/A

That is the question you may well find yourself asking during ""Coach Carter,"" a two-for-the-price-of-one social drama that combines the cliches of the super teacher saga with those of the underdog sports story.Ken Carter was a small business owner who agreed to coach a losing high school basketball team in a rundown section of Richmond, California.  What Carter discovered when he arrived on the scene was that the team was little more than an undisciplined rabble, its troubled players as unserious about life off the court as on.  Through a tough-love regimen of high scholastic standards and grueling training, Carter managed to turn a motley group of antisocial delinquents into not only a championship team, but upstanding citizens and college-bound students as well.  Despite initial opposition from both the players and the community, Carter eventually earned the respect and admiration of all.  And if this plot synopsis doesn't conjure up memories of ""The Blackboard Jungle,"" ""To Sir, With Love,"" ""Up the Down Staircase,"" ""The Bad News Bears,"" ""Dead Poets' Society,"" ""Stand and Deliver,"" ""The Mighty Ducks,"" ""Dangerous Minds,"" ""Mona Lisa Smiles"" and ""Miracle,"" then you really haven't spent much time at the movies.Although there isn't a single unpredictable moment in the entire film, excellent performances from Samuel L. Jackson and a cast of gifted young actors elevate the film to a level higher than one could reasonably expect.  Jackson provides such a strong, solid center for the story that it's hard not to be uplifted by all his inspirational words of wisdom even though we know that we are being shamelessly manipulated every step of the way.

632742,A2AD4T5FXJWNMU,B00005JNNZ,Rosan,"[2, 2]","We all love movies about underdog teams that come from behind because they (1) learn the importance of teamwork, (2) learn the importance of discipline and of respect for themselves and each other, (3) are galvanized by an inspiring leader, or, even better, (4) all of the above.This movie, based on a true story, takes it a step further. Coach Ken Carter (Samuel L. Jackson), a star athlete himself in an inner-city California high school returns to coach the team. He insists that each member of the team sign a contract that includes wearing jacket and tie on game days, attending all classes and sitting in the front row in each one, and maintaining a higher grade point average than the minimum required for participation in sports. He wanted more for the young men than a winning season. Coach Carter wanted them to have a winning life, and that means that they had to have grades that would get them into college. In his view, student athletes were students first, athletes second.This seems simple and straightforward enough unless you are a sports fan. Or unless you are the kind of person who calls himself a ""realist"" and thinks these kids are not worth trying to save. Their principal falls into that category. She figures that they are not going to graduate anyway, so the best she can do is give them one great experience they can hold onto for the rest of their lives. But Coach Carter wants more. And he wants them to want more.He brings them together as a team, turning them from playas into players.Many of the team members are struggling with other pressures, from a pregnant girlfriend (played by pop star Ashanti) to the money and excitement of street crime. Carter shows them that the biggest obstacle is their own fear of trying for more than they have. ""Starting today, you will act like winners, play like winners, and, most of all, you will be winners.""Some of the players drop out. They have no interest in school or rules. But some stay in, and the team begins to win. In most movies, there would be one setback as they lose to their cross-town rivals (the kids from the snooty school), and then they would pull themselves together for a rousing defeat of that same team for the state championship. But this movie is different.On January 4, 1999, the players arrived at the gym to find it padlocked. Carter discovered that they were not living up to their contracts. While a few were attending class and meeting or exceeding the required grade point average, most were not. And Carter would not let them play until all of them were caught up with their schoolwork and made good on all of their promises.The response by the school and the parents was outrage. Carter was threatened and a brick was thrown through his store window. It became a national news story and the focus of debate.For Carter, this was not about a winning season. It was about a winning life. He wanted his team to qualify for college scholarships. And he wanted them to learn discipline, teamwork, and self-respect.Jackson is terrific, as always, and his talent to mesmerize an audience makes him a great choice to play a coach who can give hope to people who gave up a long time ago. Just the way he says, ""Sir,"" insisting and inspiring his team to call him ""Sir"" as well, tells you everything about his character and his relationship to the players. The young cast members are more sure of themselves shooting hoops than they are showing emotion, but Jackson holds the screen so well that he gives them extra focus and presence.Families who enjoy this film will also enjoy other movies about inspirational teachers, from To Sir with Love and Up the Down Staircase to Hoosiers, Lean on Me and Stand and Deliver, and other movies about high school sports teams like Remember the Titans and Friday Night Lights. And every family should watch the brilliant documentary, Hoop Dreams, the story of two high school students from the poorest neighborhood whose skill on the basketball court leads to new opportunities and tough choices.",5,Engaging film with a terrific message.,1129766400,"10 20, 2005",2005,4030,"['love', 'movies', 'underdog', 'teams', 'come', '1', 'learn', 'importance', 'teamwork', '2', 'learn', 'importance', 'discipline', 'respect', 'other', '3', 'are', 'galvanized', 'inspiring', 'leader', 'even', 'better', '4', 'above.This', 'movie', 'based', 'true', 'story', 'step', 'further', 'Coach', 'Ken', 'Carter', 'Samuel', 'L.', 'Jackson', 'star', 'athlete', 'inner-city', 'California', 'high', 'school', 'returns', 'coach', 'team', 'member', 'team', 'sign', 'contract', 'wearing', 'jacket', 'tie', 'game', 'days', 'attending', 'classes', 'sitting', 'front', 'row', 'one', 'maintaining', 'higher', 'grade', 'point', 'average', 'minimum', 'required', 'participation', 'sports', 'wanted', 'more', 'young', 'men', 'winning', 'season', 'Coach', 'Carter', 'wanted', 'have', 'winning', 'life', 'had', 'have', 'grades', 'would', 'get', 'college', 'view', 'student', 'athletes', 'were', 'students', 'first', 'second.This', 'simple', 'straightforward', 'enough', 'are', 'sports', 'fan', 'are', 'kind', 'person', 'who', 'realist', 'kids', 'are', 'not', 'worth', 'trying', 'save', 'principal', 'falls', 'category', 'are', 'not', 'going', 'graduate', 'anyway', 'best', 'can', 'do', 'give', 'one', 'great', 'experience', 'can', 'hold', 'rest', 'lives', 'Coach', 'Carter', 'more', 'want', 'more.He', 'brings', 'together', 'team', 'turning', 'playas', 'players.Many', 'team', 'members', 'are', 'struggling', 'other', 'pressures', 'pregnant', 'girlfriend', 'played', 'pop', 'star', 'Ashanti', 'money', 'excitement', 'street', 'crime', 'Carter', 'biggest', 'obstacle', 'own', 'fear', 'trying', 'more', 'have', 'Starting', 'today', 'will', 'act', 'winners', 'play', 'winners', 'most', 'will', 'be', 'winners', 'players', 'drop', 'out', 'have', 'interest', 'school', 'rules', 'stay', 'team', 'win', 'most', 'movies', 'would', 'be', 'one', 'setback', 'lose', 'cross-town', 'rivals', 'kids', 'snooty', 'school', 'then', 'would', 'pull', 'together', 'rousing', 'defeat', 'same', 'team', 'state', 'championship', 'movie', 'different.On', 'January', '4', '1999', 'players', 'arrived', 'gym', 'find', 'padlocked', 'Carter', 'discovered', 'were', 'not', 'living', 'up', 'contracts', 'few', 'were', 'attending', 'class', 'meeting', 'exceeding', 'required', 'grade', 'point', 'average', 'most', 'were', 'not', 'Carter', 'would', 'not', 'let', 'play', 'were', 'caught', 'up', 'schoolwork', 'made', 'good', 'promises.The', 'response', 'school', 'parents', 'was', 'outrage', 'Carter', 'was', 'threatened', 'brick', 'was', 'thrown', 'store', 'window', 'became', 'national', 'news', 'story', 'focus', 'debate.For', 'Carter', 'was', 'not', 'winning', 'season', 'was', 'winning', 'life', 'wanted', 'team', 'qualify', 'college', 'scholarships', 'wanted', 'learn', 'discipline', 'teamwork', 'self-respect.Jackson', 'terrific', 'always', 'talent', 'mesmerize', 'audience', 'great', 'choice', 'play', 'coach', 'who', 'can', 'give', 'hope', 'people', 'who', 'gave', 'up', 'long', 'time', 'ago', 'Just', 'way', 'Sir', 'insisting', 'inspiring', 'team', 'call', 'Sir', 'as', 'well', 'tells', 'everything', 'character', 'relationship', 'players', 'young', 'cast', 'members', 'are', 'more', 'sure', 'shooting', 'hoops', 'are', 'showing', 'emotion', 'Jackson', 'screen', 'so', 'well', 'extra', 'focus', 'presence.Families', 'who', 'enjoy', 'film', 'will', 'also', 'enjoy', 'other', 'movies', 'inspirational', 'teachers', 'Sir', 'Love', 'Down', 'Staircase', 'Hoosiers', 'Lean', 'Me', 'Stand', 'Deliver', 'other', 'movies', 'high', 'school', 'sports', 'teams', 'Remember', 'Titans', 'Friday', 'Night', 'Lights', 'family', 'should', 'watch', 'brilliant', 'documentary', 'Hoop', 'Dreams', 'story', 'two', 'high', 'school', 'students', 'poorest', 'neighborhood', 'skill', 'basketball', 'court', 'new', 'opportunities', 'tough', 'choices']",N/A
632743,A32XW50ILWOXNO,B00005JNNZ,Samuel McKewon,"[2, 12]","Watching Samuel L. Jackson play man-as-melba-toast in ""Coach Carter,"" I got to thinking about his showy, hilarious, vicious performance in ""Jackie Brown,"" where, as Ordell, he has a moment where he thinks hard, as hard as a man can think, and arrives at the woman who's betrayed him.It could be the best scene in Jackson's career, for it is a quiet, divine moment of silence, of a man and his mind. Cruel as man may be, we were born to think, and think hard, and there are in fact answers at the end of that moment. Not of all of them, but a few, and they're occasionally important.If you were to think that hard about the ideas being thrown around ""Coach Carter,"" really think about them, well, they become less universal truths and more some of those cynical, capitalist fantasies we like to tell young people. The movie is more than two hours long and it's really peddling one lesson: Get to college. Not go. Get.It surrounds that lesson with a lot of different values like persistence and discipline, toughness and respect, and we could focus on those values if the centerpiece of the film wasn't a moment where Ken Carter (Jackson), basketball coach of Richmond High School in Southern California, cancels his team's basketball games because they're failing to maintain a 2.3 grade point average. Why isn't a 2.0, the district standard, good enough? As Carter calmly explains, well, you'd have score higher on the SATs to get a basketball scholarship with just a 2.0. With a 2.3, which is just a C-plus, well, it's easier.And that's the thinking of the movie directed by Thomas Carter, no relation to real-life Ken Carter, who really did lock his undefeated team out of practices and games in 1999. The school board voted to end the lockout, as it should, because Carter's ""contracts"" were arbitrary and not even necessarily focused on learning. Just getting a score. If you really want to know why we're behind other industrialized nations in every school subject - I'd include English -  ""Coach Carter"" brilliantly shows the way: Americans are fixated on tallying success on the chalkboard whether it means achievement or not.It's about ""goals,"" not betterment. Carter was a military and business man before he is hired as Richmond coach, and in those worlds, goals - sales goals, mission goals -  are neat and important. We've achieved lots of goals and ""success"" in Iraq. We blitzed to Baghdad in three weeks! Eighteen months later, there's electricity four hours out of the day and the sewers are above ground.So you get to college. You have to go, too.I considered these things because, on a filmmaking level, ""Coach Carter"" is better suited for those CBS Hallmark specials. Thomas Carter and his team make a safe, clean, well-lit film with Jackson's stiff, starched shirt braying at his troops, who throw a little attitude but generally want a father figure to hug. The team is made of the same old parts: The Angry, Troubled One; The Funny One; The One With A Pregnant Girlfriend; The Dumb One; The Good One, which in this case is Carter's son; The Different One, which here is just a white guy.  Showdowns, throwdowns, staredowns, put-downs - Carter employs at least one of each.It's boilerplate, and there is no ""Coach Carter"" without the lockout material and grandstanding for education. Consider that there is an player who can barely read during the movie; we learn later he attended college. Does that say more or less for our education system? College basketball graduation rates are miserable precisely because many athletes don't belong there, and we've got enough examples of athletes landing in college without a junior high education.The basketball scenes provide another view of the movie's problem: They involve an element of strategy and employ various cameras, but we're never allowed a moment to forget the glut of alternating dunks and three-pointers That's what passes for success in American basketball.In the Olympics, the rest of the world disagreed.",2,A boring retread with an empty message,1120694400,"07 7, 2005",2005,3985,"['Watching', 'Samuel', 'L.', 'Jackson', 'play', 'man-as-melba-toast', 'Coach', 'Carter', 'got', 'thinking', 'showy', 'hilarious', 'vicious', 'performance', 'Jackie', 'Brown', 'where', 'Ordell', 'moment', 'where', 'hard', 'as', 'hard', 'man', 'can', 'think', 'woman', 'who', 'betrayed', 'him.It', 'could', 'be', 'best', 'scene', 'Jackson', 'career', 'quiet', 'divine', 'moment', 'silence', 'man', 'mind', 'Cruel', 'man', 'may', 'be', 'were', 'born', 'think', 'think', 'hard', 'are', 'fact', 'answers', 'end', 'moment', 'Not', 'few', ""'re"", 'occasionally', 'important.If', 'were', 'think', 'hard', 'ideas', 'being', 'thrown', 'Coach', 'Carter', 'really', 'think', 'well', 'become', 'less', 'universal', 'truths', 'more', 'cynical', 'capitalist', 'fantasies', 'like', 'tell', 'young', 'people', 'movie', 'more', 'two', 'hours', 'long', 'really', 'peddling', 'one', 'lesson', 'Get', 'college', 'Not', 'go', 'Get.It', 'lesson', 'lot', 'different', 'values', 'persistence', 'discipline', 'toughness', 'respect', 'could', 'focus', 'values', 'centerpiece', 'film', 'was', ""n't"", 'moment', 'where', 'Ken', 'Carter', 'Jackson', 'basketball', 'coach', 'Richmond', 'High', 'School', 'Southern', 'California', 'team', 'basketball', 'games', ""'re"", 'failing', 'maintain', '2.3', 'grade', 'point', 'average', 'Why', ""n't"", '2.0', 'district', 'standard', 'good', 'enough', 'Carter', 'calmly', 'explains', 'well', ""'d"", 'have', 'score', 'higher', 'SATs', 'get', 'basketball', 'scholarship', 'just', '2.0', '2.3', 'just', 'C-plus', 'well', 'thinking', 'movie', 'directed', 'Thomas', 'Carter', 'relation', 'real-life', 'Ken', 'Carter', 'who', 'really', 'did', 'lock', 'undefeated', 'team', 'practices', 'games', '1999', 'school', 'board', 'voted', 'end', 'lockout', 'should', 'Carter', 'contracts', 'were', 'arbitrary', 'not', 'even', 'necessarily', 'focused', 'learning', 'Just', 'getting', 'score', 'really', 'want', 'know', 'why', ""'re"", 'other', 'industrialized', 'nations', 'school', 'subject', ""'d"", 'include', 'English', 'Coach', 'Carter', 'brilliantly', 'way', 'Americans', 'are', 'fixated', 'tallying', 'success', 'chalkboard', 'achievement', 'not.It', 'goals', 'not', 'betterment', 'Carter', 'was', 'military', 'business', 'man', 'hired', 'Richmond', 'coach', 'worlds', 'goals', 'sales', 'goals', 'mission', 'goals', 'are', 'neat', 'important', ""'ve"", 'achieved', 'lots', 'goals', 'success', 'Iraq', 'blitzed', 'Baghdad', 'three', 'weeks', 'Eighteen', 'months', 'later', 'electricity', 'four', 'hours', 'day', 'sewers', 'are', 'ground.So', 'get', 'college', 'have', 'go', 'too.I', 'considered', 'things', 'because', 'filmmaking', 'level', 'Coach', 'Carter', 'better', 'suited', 'CBS', 'Hallmark', 'specials', 'Thomas', 'Carter', 'team', 'make', 'safe', 'clean', 'well-lit', 'film', 'Jackson', 'stiff', 'starched', 'shirt', 'braying', 'troops', 'who', 'throw', 'little', 'attitude', 'generally', 'want', 'father', 'figure', 'hug', 'team', 'made', 'same', 'old', 'parts', 'Angry', 'Troubled', 'One', 'Funny', 'One', 'One', 'A', 'Pregnant', 'Girlfriend', 'Dumb', 'One', 'Good', 'One', 'case', 'Carter', 'son', 'Different', 'One', 'here', 'just', 'white', 'guy', 'Showdowns', 'throwdowns', 'staredowns', 'put-downs', 'Carter', 'least', 'one', 'each.It', 'boilerplate', 'Coach', 'Carter', 'lockout', 'material', 'grandstanding', 'education', 'Consider', 'player', 'who', 'can', 'barely', 'read', 'movie', 'learn', 'later', 'attended', 'college', 'say', 'more', 'less', 'education', 'system', 'College', 'basketball', 'graduation', 'rates', 'are', 'miserable', 'precisely', 'many', 'athletes', 'do', ""n't"", 'belong', 'there', ""'ve"", 'got', 'enough', 'examples', 'athletes', 'landing', 'college', 'junior', 'high', 'education.The', 'basketball', 'scenes', 'provide', 'view', 'movie', 'problem', 'involve', 'element', 'strategy', 'employ', 'various', 'cameras', ""'re"", 'never', 'allowed', 'moment', 'forget', 'glut', 'alternating', 'dunks', 'three-pointers', 'what', 'success', 'American', 'Olympics', 'rest', 'world', 'disagreed']",N/A

As a teacher, I found what Carter did despite the community's hostility towards his decision to close down the school gym until the team's grades went up as revolutionary.The movie is a basketball movie (the most exciting scenes are when the team are winning basketball), but it focuses more on how Carter actually teaches them the value of education, discipline, and respect, thus coaching them through life.RecommendedB+",4,Coach Carter is a winner!,1120867200,"07 9, 2005",2005,927,"['Samuel', 'Jackson', 'Pulp', 'Fiction', 'Jackie', 'Brown', 'Star', 'Wars', 'Episode', '3', 'Return', 'Sith', 'one', 'most', 'outstanding', 'performances', 'Coach', 'Ken', 'Carter.The', 'movie', 'based', 'true', 'story', 'how', 'Carter', 'influenced', 'high', 'schools', 'country', 'choose', 'academics', 'before', 'athletics', 'important', 'factor', 'athletic', 'students', 'success', 'school', 'challenging', 'Richmond', 'California', 'high', 'school', 'think', 'again', 'where', 'will', 'lead', 'kids', 'do', 'not', 'take', 'consideration', 'teacher', 'found', 'what', 'Carter', 'did', 'community', 'hostility', 'decision', 'close', 'down', 'school', 'gym', 'team', 'grades', 'went', 'up', 'revolutionary.The', 'movie', 'basketball', 'movie', 'most', 'exciting', 'scenes', 'are', 'when', 'team', 'are', 'winning', 'basketball', 'more', 'how', 'Carter', 'actually', 'value', 'education', 'discipline', 'respect', 'thus', 'coaching', 'life.RecommendedB+']",N/A

And although most of the games were exciting to watch--they got to be repetitive after a while. I found myself drifting off a little during the championship game at the end.

from Mostly every actor in this movie, Coach Carter is a sunray admist the darkness of bad and immoral movies that have been released lately and i am very happy that people still want to make inspirational films.The Plot-The movie starts with The Richmond High Basketball team losing a preseason game against one of their rivals and the team already looks like a mess before the season even starts.With teammates throwing the blame at other teammates, the team is not stable and is in need of authority.The Present Coach has decided that he wants to retire and Has offered Ken Carter(Samuel L jackson) the job of being the coach for his team.After not much of thinking, Ken accepts the job with a fifteen hundred dollar check and takes responsiblity for the team.As soon as Ken begins his coaching session with the kids he is tested very early as a kid named Cruz says he doesnt want to listen to the coach and Tells Ken that he is not scared of him and could knock him out if he wanted too.With Cruz face to face with Ken he makes like he is about to walk away and then tries to sucker punch Ken, But Ken with his quick reflexes catches his arm, twists it around and slams Cruz against the padded wall.This is a early sign to the kids that this coach is different and they will have to earn their playing time.Coach Carter shows the kids parents that he has contracts for them and they must have atleast a 2.3 GPA, sit in front of all their classes, and must wear a suit and tie on gamedays.To the parents displeasure they do not like this idea and already start to get bothered by Ken's strict policy and list of rules.Coach Carter drills his players by running up and down the court repeately, many sets of pushups, grueling practices BUT what the kids and sadly not even the community realizes is Coach Carter cares for his players and wants them to succeed in basketball but more important he wants them to have good grades and go on to college after high school and avoid the street life.But what happens when the players start to win, become a good basketball team but their grades are horrible and they don't adhere to the contract they signed with the coach?Coach Carter does something very controversial that catches the attention of reporters,  parents, and  community members and you see how it plays out for the kids.The Negatives-The only minor flaw that this movie has is it drags towards the ending.Just when you think it's over, it keeps going, you think it's over, Nope keeps going.It gets a little annoying but it doesn't damage the movie and the ending is worthwhile to watch anyway.The Positives-Great performance by Samuel L jackson,Great supporting acting from the team members,Ashanti gets a little annoying with her baby momma drama but this movie does deliver a mostly great acted movie.And to the guy that played Cruz, i have to give it to him he played a great role Dare i say a Best Supporting actor Oscar nomination?Conclusion-This movie has it all, great acting, good sports action, humour, drama, suspense, And most important a great message.This movie should be seen by you and your whole family and every avid DVD sports fan MUST add this movie to their collection alongside Rudy, hoosiers, remember the titans and all the other sports classics.4.5 stars rounded up to 5 out of 5The Opinionated One has spoken",5,Coach Carter is a great

Yes, this story has been done in similar fashion several times--Stand and Deliver and Music of the Heart come to mind--yet this production has such an authentic feel to it!The sheer number of life-changing struggles the movie grapples with is amazing: teen pregnancy, sports vs. academics, the seemingly realistic defeatism of educational bureaucracy, the draw of easy money and seeming respect that drug dealing garners vs. the tough road of diligence that sports and study demand--all bound together by a driven coach, human enough to be hurt by opposition, but certain enough to stay a tough course.One other very positive aspect of Coach Carter is that the movie obviously draws much of its inspiration from the African-American community, yet includes a Hispanic character, a White character, and an African-American boy who's been educated amongst whites, and must now re-enter the predominantly black student culture.The two factors that keep this movie at four stars are that this story has indeed been done often. Even the most inspired reproduction never quite gets declared a masterpiece. Additionally, the wrap up of the teen pregnancy issue was a bit too political--too blatant.

But at the same time, this unanimous praise suggests, when Sam Jackson is not on the screen, the film is your standard sports film with familiar characters in familiar situations.  Delete any scenes without Samuel L. Jackson, and this long (136 minute) film would be much better.[COACH CARTER] 'Coach Carter' is about Ken Carter, who accepted the job of leading an ailing high school basketball team in Richmond.  Thanks to his coaching with hard training and strict rules, the team revives.  Richmond is on the way to the State when an unprecedented thing happen.That is, because of the players whose grade in the class couldn't reach the required mark, Coach Carter not only blocks out the gym, but cancells the games themselves.  When being a good player means scholarship, Carter sticks to his principle that the adults cannot send a wrong message to the students -- message that being good atheles mean they could be above the law.  Quite natural that his decision enrages the parents and the community, who require that Carter should be dismissed.[DIRECTOR CARTER] What happens next?  As you see, the 'real events' depicted here pose important question about education (which is probably a universal issue).  However, Thomas Carter ('Metro''Save the Last Dance') relies on cliched storytelling methods that were done again and again in the past.  I do not say predictability is an evil thing.  I'd rather welcome it in ususl sports films, but not here, because obviously Coach Carter made no usual decision, which should be more explored, and given more time than the 'house party' sequences we are not interested in.  It sounds cruel to say this, but Diretor Carter reduced the whole issue Coach Carter proposes to the formulaic story with 'big game' showdown.Another defect of the film is its descriptions of the students outside the school.  The film's cursory treatment of the teenagers and their life is doing harm to the well-intentioned film.  Serious issues like drugs and pregnancy among teenagers are taken up and all settled in the most convenient way.  Clearly Director Carter has no guts to tackle the social issues as Coach Carter did.Good news is that Samuel L. Jackson is back in good form after so many below-average films like 'Basic' or 'Twisted' (I don't count his voice appearance in 'The Incredibles').  And the scenes of the basketball games are realistic with the kids who can really play.

The retiring coach is tired and seeking retirement.  Carter immediately sees the disarray the program has fallen into as players fight and curse one another after yet another losing game.  The team will compile a sorry 4-22 record, meaning that there is much work to be done.Samuel L. Jackson, an Oscar Best Actor nominee for ""Pulp Fiction,"" turns in a brilliant effort as a coach who insists that his players seek to be the best human beings it is possible for them to become.  In this fast-paced Thomas Carter film, Jackson opens the first practice session by demanding respect.  There will be no more slurry, disrespectful comments and everybody will be called ""Sir"".  He then mandates that the players, who have been loafing in practice, work hard, sending them through long series' of tough back and forth running exercises called ""suicides"" and pushups.Once that the players get in shape and the meticulous Carter instills some solid offensive and defensive fundamentals in them they do the previously unthinkable.  The perennial doormat and laughing stock team begins garnering headlines by winning regularly, chalking up a winning streak of 17 in a row including one impressive tournament triumph.The film then reaches its dramatic cornerstone.  Carter has insisted that in order to play all of his players must sign contracts to compile at least a 2.3 grade point average and go to class regularly.  When the progressive reports he has asked the teaching staff to compile are submitted he explodes, observing that his players have failed to keep their part of the bargain in the academics sphere.It avails the players nothing when they protest that they have won 17 games in a row.  Carter brings the school's impressive winning streak to an end when they forfeit games and he padlocks the gymnasium, not allowing the team to practice or play games until they honor the contract with the coach by securing grades solid enough to enable them to enter college and become eligible for decent jobs and a good start in life.At one point Carter is overruled by the school's higher ups, which instead opt for the easy route and ending the lockout.  After all, community pressure is strong and Carter is seen as a hard head, demanding too much at a time when the school is finally winning games.The story takes an interesting turn when the players speak up.  One by one they begin to see that Carter is looking out for their best interests as human beings beyond the basketball court.At a time when highly paid professional athletes have been resorting increasingly to spoiled and immature antics and the focus on winning has become in the eyes of many the only thing, this film comes as a breath of fresh air.  As sports commentator Bob Costas says in a brief segment playing himself, many Americans admire a man who insists that the term student athlete mean something, as Carter did.",5,Principle Over Winning,1120608000,"07 6, 2005",2005,3396,"['Ken', 'Carter', 'grew', 'up', 'tough', 'ghetto', 'Richmond', 'California', 'next', 'door', 'Oakland', 'scrapped', 'way', 'most', 'valuable', 'player', 'record', 'setter', 'points', 'assists', 'Richmond', 'High', 'School', 'earned', 'four-year', 'scholarship', 'basketball', 'George', 'Mason', 'University', 'Virginia', 'Twenty-eight', 'years', 'later', 'alma', 'mater', 'when', 'SOS', 'sent', 'out', 'veteran', 'coach', 'set', 'retire.Carter', 'asked', 'return', 'Richmond', 'coach', 'basketball', 'squad', 'film', 'adaptation', 'true', 'story', 'retiring', 'coach', 'tired', 'seeking', 'retirement', 'Carter', 'immediately', 'disarray', 'program', 'fallen', 'players', 'fight', 'curse', 'one', 'yet', 'losing', 'game', 'team', 'will', 'compile', 'sorry', '4-22', 'record', 'meaning', 'much', 'work', 'be', 'done.Samuel', 'L.', 'Jackson', 'Oscar', 'Best', 'Actor', 'nominee', 'Pulp', 'Fiction', 'brilliant', 'effort', 'coach', 'who', 'players', 'seek', 'be', 'best', 'human', 'beings', 'possible', 'become', 'fast-paced', 'Thomas', 'Carter', 'film', 'Jackson', 'first', 'practice', 'session', 'demanding', 'respect', 'will', 'be', 'no', 'more', 'slurry', 'disrespectful', 'comments', 'everybody', 'will', 'be', 'called', 'Sir', 'then', 'players', 'who', 'have', 'been', 'loafing', 'practice', 'work', 'hard', 'sending', 'long', 'series', 'tough', 'back', 'forth', 'running', 'exercises', 'called', 'suicides', 'pushups.Once', 'players', 'get', 'shape', 'meticulous', 'Carter', 'solid', 'offensive', 'defensive', 'fundamentals', 'do', 'previously', 'unthinkable', 'perennial', 'doormat', 'laughing', 'stock', 'team', 'garnering', 'headlines', 'winning', 'regularly', 'chalking', 'up', 'winning', 'streak', '17', 'row', 'including', 'one', 'impressive', 'tournament', 'triumph.The', 'film', 'then', 'dramatic', 'cornerstone', 'Carter', 'insisted', 'order', 'play', 'players', 'must', 'sign', 'contracts', 'compile', 'least', '2.3', 'grade', 'point', 'average', 'go', 'class', 'regularly', 'When', 'progressive', 'reports', 'asked', 'teaching', 'staff', 'compile', 'are', 'submitted', 'observing', 'players', 'have', 'failed', 'keep', 'part', 'bargain', 'academics', 'sphere.It', 'players', 'nothing', 'when', 'protest', 'have', 'won', '17', 'games', 'row', 'Carter', 'school', 'impressive', 'winning', 'streak', 'end', 'when', 'forfeit', 'games', 'gymnasium', 'not', 'allowing', 'team', 'practice', 'play', 'games', 'honor', 'contract', 'coach', 'securing', 'grades', 'solid', 'enough', 'enable', 'enter', 'college', 'become', 'eligible', 'decent', 'jobs', 'good', 'start', 'life.At', 'one', 'point', 'Carter', 'overruled', 'school', 'higher', 'ups', 'instead', 'opt', 'easy', 'route', 'ending', 'lockout', 'community', 'pressure', 'strong', 'Carter', 'seen', 'hard', 'head', 'demanding', 'too', 'much', 'time', 'when', 'school', 'finally', 'winning', 'games.The', 'story', 'interesting', 'turn', 'when', 'players', 'speak', 'up', 'One', 'one', 'begin', 'see', 'Carter', 'looking', 'out', 'best', 'interests', 'human', 'beings', 'basketball', 'time', 'when', 'highly', 'paid', 'professional', 'athletes', 'have', 'been', 'resorting', 'increasingly', 'spoiled', 'immature', 'antics', 'focus', 'winning', 'become', 'eyes', 'many', 'only', 'thing', 'film', 'breath', 'fresh', 'air', 'sports', 'commentator', 'Bob', 'Costas', 'brief', 'segment', 'playing', 'many', 'Americans', 'admire', 'man', 'who', 'term', 'student', 'athlete', 'mean', 'something', 'Carter', 'did']",N/A
