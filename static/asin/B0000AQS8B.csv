I laugh out loud whenever Jeff tries to talk to a woman he likes. He is my favorite character on the show. I also like the developments between Steve and Susan. And we get even more hints of a future relationship between Sally and Patrick in this one. The dialogue and storylines are sharper and cleverer than the ones on season one. The characters get all the more neurotic on this season. Jane is more self-absorbed than ever and I thought Sally couldn't get any shallower than she was on season one. Susan is by far the saner one of the girls. As for the guys... I love it when they get together at the pub to discuss serious subject matters such as breasts and porn. (Isn't it funny that the characters on sitcoms always have a favorite hangout? The Seinfeld lot frequented a diner, the Friends bunch spent their days at a coffee shop, and the Coupling folk meet at their favorite pub. I also think it's funny that they always sit on the same spot. The Coupling characters always sit on the same sofa, not unlike Friends.) My favorite episodes are ""The Man with Two Legs,"" ""Her Best Friend's Bottom,"" ""Dressed,"" ""Naked,"" and ""The End of the Line."" I thought those episodes were hilarious to the max.

767701,A3ICDLUQ3V2QY2,B0000AQS8B,"Kevin L. Nenstiel ""omnivore""","[0, 0]","If you're looking for a DVD that simply continues the first series of Coupling, sorry, this isn't it.  This moves the story forward, creating more complications for the story arc, deepening the characters, telling us more about who these people are and where they come from.  We find out more about Sally's insecurity, Jeff's libido, Steve and Susan's relationship, and more.The DVD of the first series of Coupling was so short you could watch it all in one sitting.  This isn't the case with the second series, which ran to nine episodes and doesn't even fit on one disk.  You have to pace yourself with this one.  But it's worth it, because each episode teaches us something new about our beloved characters and also gives us plenty of laughs.The first two episodes, &quot;The Man with Two Legs&quot; and &quot;My Dinner in Hell,&quot; really feel incomplete, like transitional episodes from the previous series.  But beginning with the third and fourth episodes, a two-parter called &quot;Her Best Friend's Bottom&quot; and &quot;The Melty Man Cometh,&quot; things get low-down, dirty, and more sophisticated.  Episodes like &quot;Naked&quot; and &quot;Jane and the Truth Snake,&quot; in which we learn a great deal about all six characters, and the structurally complex &quot;End of the Line,&quot; are worth watching over and over.One benefit to this DVD is that it contains commentary from writer Steven Moffett and various stars and production personnel.  This allows us insight into the creation of this sophisticated comedy.  This feature was lacking from the previous series DVD, and it's something I missed.It's easy to see why the American version of this series failed.  Like Monty Python and Doctor Who, it's such a quintessentially British show that Americanizing it could only ruin it.  But after watching that Yankee turkey, now you can come over and watch this fine British songbird.

Bernabo,"[5, 6]","If by ""funny"" you mean that you laugh out loud even though there is nobody at home and that you find somebody to call me immediately so that you can share with them some bit that strikes you as hysterical (but that they will not understand because they have never seen the show), then ""Coupling: The Complete Second Season"" is the funniest thing I have seen in several months.  The biggest complaint is that the first episode of the second series, ""The Man With Two Legs,"" is the funniest of the nine wacky looks at sex in England.  However, I would not claim that it was all downhill from there because the starting point would be more along the lines of a mountain.I am way past the idea that a series of ""Coupling"" is like a season of ""Friends"" boiled down to all of the plotlines dealing with sex.  But that is going to be an obvious frame of reference for colonial viewers.  The main couple in the ""Coupling"" sextet is Steve Taylor (Jack Davenport) and Susan Walker (Sarah Alexander), who are now living together.  They are the main couple not only because they are based on creator Steven Moffat and his wife Sue, but because they are the only couple on ""Coupling.""  While the question of whether Steve will pop the question to Susan is a recurring concern in these episodes, everybody else is fair game.  Besides, clearly the entire point of the existence of Jeff Murdock (Richard Coyle) is to find new ways to avoid having women have sex with him while Patrick Maitland (Ben Miles) fails just as often as Jeff succeeds (see ""The Melty Man Cometh"" and ""The End of the Line"" respectively).  In the second series Sally Harper (Kate Isitt) is not as psychotic about her appearance (and I like the shorter hair), while Jane Christie (Gina Bellman) almost had me convinced that she had joined the others on planet Earth until she lost her job in ""Jane and the Truth Snake.""It is nice that there were three additional episodes for series two and I want to watch series three as soon as I can get my hands on it and it is good to know that series four is on its way, but I think that the limited number of episodes (less than half what you get on ""Friends"" or most American situation comedies), works in favor of ""Coupling.""  This is not just because you only have to come up with nine scripts instead of twenty or more, but also because you can only wring so much out of a sexual farce without becoming redundant and repetitive.  Give everybody three episodes where they get one of the two major plotlines and that takes care of the entire series.  How hard is it to come up with three great ideas for each character?  It is when you get into double figures that you get into trouble.I understand that many of you will be dissuaded from giving ""Coupling"" a try because you saw the American version, which basically took the original scripts, made a few changes, and set them in the U.S.  This was a major mistake, because the fact that these characters are British matters, which means the humor matters being British matters as well.  I have given up on American situation comedies mainly because I got sick and tired of finding stupid people funny.  But Jeff takes it to a whole new level and the sense of anticipation as he tries desperately to talk himself out of saying something stupid, knowing that this is a battle he will never win, is delicious.  Okay, I also find Susan's eyes adorable, so there is an aesthetic dimension as well.  The bottom line is that if you are checking out series two then you have already seen series one, in which case you do not need to be convinced that this show is funny, so I am preaching to the choir.",5,The second series is funnier (and longer) than the first,1099958400,"11 9, 2004",2004,3644,"['funny', 'mean', 'laugh', 'out', 'loud', 'even', 'nobody', 'home', 'find', 'somebody', 'call', 'immediately', 'can', 'share', 'bit', 'hysterical', 'will', 'not', 'understand', 'have', 'never', 'seen', 'show', 'then', 'Coupling', 'Complete', 'Second', 'Season', 'funniest', 'thing', 'have', 'seen', 'several', 'months', 'biggest', 'complaint', 'first', 'episode', 'second', 'series', 'Man', 'Two', 'Legs', 'funniest', 'nine', 'wacky', 'looks', 'sex', 'England', 'However', 'would', 'not', 'claim', 'was', 'downhill', 'there', 'starting', 'point', 'would', 'be', 'more', 'lines', 'mountain.I', 'am', 'way', 'idea', 'series', 'Coupling', 'season', 'Friends', 'boiled', 'down', 'plotlines', 'dealing', 'sex', 'going', 'be', 'obvious', 'frame', 'reference', 'colonial', 'viewers', 'main', 'couple', 'Coupling', 'sextet', 'Steve', 'Taylor', 'Jack', 'Davenport', 'Susan', 'Walker', 'Sarah', 'Alexander', 'who', 'are', 'now', 'living', 'together', 'are', 'main', 'couple', 'not', 'only', 'are', 'based', 'creator', 'Steven', 'Moffat', 'wife', 'Sue', 'are', 'only', 'couple', 'Coupling', 'question', 'Steve', 'will', 'pop', 'question', 'Susan', 'recurring', 'concern', 'episodes', 'everybody', 'else', 'fair', 'game', 'Besides', 'clearly', 'entire', 'point', 'existence', 'Jeff', 'Murdock', 'Richard', 'Coyle', 'find', 'new', 'ways', 'avoid', 'having', 'women', 'have', 'sex', 'Patrick', 'Maitland', 'Ben', 'Miles', 'just', 'as', 'often', 'Jeff', 'see', 'Melty', 'Man', 'Cometh', 'End', 'Line', 'respectively', 'second', 'series', 'Sally', 'Harper', 'Kate', 'Isitt', 'not', 'psychotic', 'appearance', 'like', 'shorter', 'hair', 'Jane', 'Christie', 'Gina', 'Bellman', 'almost', 'had', 'convinced', 'had', 'joined', 'others', 'planet', 'Earth', 'lost', 'job', 'Jane', 'Truth', 'Snake', 'nice', 'were', 'three', 'additional', 'episodes', 'series', 'two', 'want', 'watch', 'series', 'three', 'as', 'soon', 'can', 'get', 'hands', 'good', 'know', 'series', 'four', 'way', 'think', 'limited', 'number', 'episodes', 'less', 'what', 'get', 'Friends', 'most', 'American', 'situation', 'comedies', 'favor', 'Coupling', 'not', 'just', 'only', 'have', 'come', 'up', 'nine', 'scripts', 'instead', 'twenty', 'more', 'also', 'can', 'only', 'wring', 'so', 'much', 'sexual', 'farce', 'becoming', 'redundant', 'repetitive', 'Give', 'everybody', 'three', 'episodes', 'where', 'get', 'one', 'two', 'major', 'plotlines', 'care', 'entire', 'series', 'How', 'hard', 'come', 'up', 'three', 'great', 'ideas', 'character', 'when', 'get', 'double', 'figures', 'get', 'trouble.I', 'understand', 'many', 'will', 'be', 'dissuaded', 'giving', 'Coupling', 'try', 'saw', 'American', 'version', 'basically', 'took', 'original', 'scripts', 'made', 'few', 'changes', 'set', 'U.S', 'was', 'major', 'mistake', 'fact', 'characters', 'are', 'British', 'matters', 'humor', 'matters', 'being', 'British', 'matters', 'as', 'well', 'have', 'given', 'up', 'American', 'situation', 'comedies', 'mainly', 'got', 'sick', 'tired', 'finding', 'stupid', 'people', 'funny', 'Jeff', 'whole', 'new', 'level', 'sense', 'anticipation', 'desperately', 'talk', 'saying', 'something', 'stupid', 'knowing', 'battle', 'will', 'never', 'win', 'delicious', 'Okay', 'also', 'find', 'Susan', 'eyes', 'adorable', 'aesthetic', 'dimension', 'as', 'well', 'bottom', 'line', 'are', 'checking', 'out', 'series', 'two', 'then', 'have', 'already', 'seen', 'series', 'one', 'case', 'do', 'not', 'need', 'be', 'convinced', 'show', 'funny', 'am', 'preaching', 'choir']",N/A

767707,A2RDR5G65D9H84,B0000AQS8B,Sebastian Fernandez,"[3, 4]","One day my wife talked to me about a new series she discovered in BBC America and said that since I liked Friends so much I should watch it. I was not very prone to do it, but you know how it is...I complied :). I started watching an episode of Coupling that was already started, after ten minutes I did not understand very well what was going on and decided the series was not worth my time.A couple of months later my wife rented the first season of Coupling in DVD and this time I sat with her to watch it from the start. I could not stop laughing! Of course I ordered the second season too and plan to do the same with the following ones.The basic setting of the series is similar to the one of Friends; three males and three females that have clearly defined personalities and get involved in funny situations. Coupling has a more prominent sex element present. In the particular case of the men, I can draw a clear parallel with Friends, but it is not so easy in the case of the women (I would relate Jane in Coupling with Phoebe in Friends, but that's it).I think Jeff is the most interesting character the series has, he is almost always living in a ""different world"" and if you have watched the first season then you know about the Jeffisms; like the naked giggles. In the second season there are some new Jeffisms, like prickles, blurts and head laugh. There are also a few phrases by Jeff that struck me as particularly funny, like ""When a woman wears a skirt you know there is a VAA...a Visual Access Angle"", or ""There was a detectable NAT...Nose Avoidance Tilting"".The writers of the series do a great job in manipulating the differences between men and women, often showing the same situation from both sides emphasizing the contrasts. The dialogues are witty and usually several topics are connected in a very short space of time creating hilarious threads.You cannot afford to miss this!",5,"I am a big fan of ""Friends"", but...",1075161600,"01 27, 2004",2004,1903,"['One', 'day', 'wife', 'talked', 'new', 'series', 'discovered', 'BBC', 'America', 'said', 'liked', 'Friends', 'so', 'much', 'should', 'watch', 'was', 'not', 'very', 'prone', 'do', 'know', 'how', 'complied', 'started', 'watching', 'episode', 'Coupling', 'was', 'already', 'started', 'ten', 'minutes', 'did', 'not', 'understand', 'very', 'well', 'what', 'was', 'going', 'decided', 'series', 'was', 'not', 'worth', 'time.A', 'couple', 'months', 'later', 'wife', 'rented', 'first', 'season', 'Coupling', 'DVD', 'time', 'sat', 'watch', 'start', 'could', 'not', 'stop', 'laughing', 'course', 'ordered', 'second', 'season', 'too', 'plan', 'do', 'same', 'following', 'ones.The', 'basic', 'setting', 'series', 'similar', 'one', 'Friends', 'three', 'males', 'three', 'females', 'have', 'clearly', 'defined', 'personalities', 'get', 'involved', 'funny', 'situations', 'Coupling', 'more', 'prominent', 'sex', 'element', 'present', 'particular', 'case', 'men', 'can', 'draw', 'clear', 'parallel', 'Friends', 'not', 'so', 'easy', 'case', 'women', 'would', 'relate', 'Jane', 'Coupling', 'Phoebe', 'Friends', 'think', 'Jeff', 'most', 'interesting', 'character', 'series', 'almost', 'always', 'living', 'different', 'world', 'have', 'watched', 'first', 'season', 'then', 'know', 'Jeffisms', 'naked', 'giggles', 'second', 'season', 'are', 'new', 'Jeffisms', 'prickles', 'blurts', 'head', 'laugh', 'are', 'also', 'few', 'phrases', 'Jeff', 'struck', 'particularly', 'funny', 'When', 'woman', 'skirt', 'know', 'VAA', 'Visual', 'Access', 'Angle', 'was', 'detectable', 'NAT', 'Nose', 'Avoidance', 'Tilting', '.The', 'writers', 'series', 'do', 'great', 'job', 'manipulating', 'differences', 'men', 'women', 'often', 'showing', 'same', 'situation', 'sides', 'emphasizing', 'contrasts', 'dialogues', 'are', 'witty', 'usually', 'several', 'topics', 'are', 'connected', 'very', 'short', 'space', 'time', 'creating', 'hilarious', 'threads.You', 'can', 'not', 'afford', 'miss']",N/A

Yes, you can watch &quot;Coupling&quot; on BBC America, but these DVD's are worth it, because they still edit some content for time.

Will he blow it with another one of his bumbling lines?MY DINNER IN HELL: Steve bumps into a television presenter he's always fantasized about, and Jane has a fool-proof hairbrained scheme that she swears will help she and Sally meet her.HER BEST FRIENDS BOTTOM: Steve makes a surprise visit at Susan's apartment, thinking it is she in the shower. It's Sally, and the entire episode revolves around that fact that Steve saw her bottom.THE MELTY MAN COMETH: Will Patrick and Sally finally come together? If Patrick doesn't stop &quot;failing&quot; then perhaps they can!JANE AND THE TRUTH SNAKE: In possibly one of the funniest episodes ever, Jane loses her job as traffic reporter. Never fear! She has a career plan up her sleeve that involves children's entertainment and a sock puppet. That's all I'll say.GOTCHA: One year after their first date, a wedding invite is sent to Steven and Susan. Steve, of course, panics into thinking Susan will now pe expecting a proposal herself.DRESSED: The meaning of Jane's invite to a dinner date is misunderstood, and she shows up naked under her coat. When she arrives to a flat full of guests, she has to do some quick thinking (rather a lot for Jane, really!).NAKED: Jeff's 30th birthday is coming, and his workmates have planned a surprise celebration for him. Again, invites are misunderstood and Jeff ends up stripping down naked in front of his workmates...and his parents!THE END OF THE LINE: Steve and Susan both assume aliases to swap phone numbers with other people in a bar, but the hilarity ensues when they realize it's with each other!Extras include more interviews with the cast and executive producer.

Their friends and ex-partners are also around to provide somewhat insane (but partially true) insights into relationships.With season two, Coupling begins to take more risks with its humor. More risque and bold. First season seems a little tame compared to this DVD. The third season goes even further than this one. Season 2 has 9 episodes.{Amazon deleted my episode details. Sorry, I guess they didn't like my summaries.)The commentaries are good. Steven Moffat is the only one in all of the commentaries. Sue Vertue, Ben Miles, Kate Isitt, Sarah Alexander, and Gina Bellman are among the ones who can be heard in some of the commentaries. They discuss some of the background for some of the scenes as well as aspects of the production. Not the usual dull experts talking.There are short interviews with Beryl Vertue (Sue's mom), Steven Moffat, and Jack Davenport.I'm not sure of the reason for the color of the DVD case - bright green. Season one's case is blue. The cases do stand out. I like the bright colors, but I was trying to find a pattern or clue about the color choices.Within the extras, there are hints at a 4th season of Coupling being written.

Jane careens about as before, though.Ultimately, this makes the series less funny, if more meaningful. I truly enjoyed getting to hear Jeff's theory du jour, something that is thinned out here. While Jeff remains hilariously neurotic, he was the main comic engine on the show, and I feel slightly deprived in this change. Additionally, the pain Sally and Patrick begin to go through resulting from several abortive attempts at a relationship, also takes away from the pure comedy, but does add emotional weight, which the series bears well. This is especially made by Kate Isitt's blossoming portrayal of Sally, previously a one-note neurotic, now more fascinating emotional force.Steven Moffat remains a master at writing, especially in writing dialogue that is taken to mean very different things by the conversing characters, and at creating foot-, ankle-, and leg-swallowing monologues. This keeps the shows highly enjoyable, even at their most deliriously improbable moments.Ultimately this is a fine comedic presentation, though lacking the sparkle of Series 1, or the emotional complexity and burning hilarity of Series 3. The DVD itself is a good transfer, very clean images, good sound (let's face it, Dolby 5.1 won't add much, anyway). The menus are more of the same from Series 1, and the special features are improved in quanitity over the first, but the commentary is lackluster.",4,"A bit more scattershot, a bit less Jeffisms, Still very good",1073088000,"01 3, 2004",2004,1935,"[""'ll"", 'spare', 'quot', 'so', 'much', 'better', 'what', 'NBC', 'did', 'tripe.', 'quot', 'stars', 'should', 'tell', 'that.The', 'second', 'season', 'Coupling', 'tries', 'break', 'mold', 'first', 'season', 'throwing', 'Steve', 'Susan', 'situations', 'greater', 'gravity', 'showing', 'strength', 'affection', 'letting', 'Jeff', 'step', 'mad', 'scientist', 'role', 'Season', '1', 'interact', 'more', 'women', 'even', 'one', 'day', 'successfully', 'beginning', 'slow', 'orbit', 'Patrick', 'Sally', 'culiminated', 'beautifully', 'hilariously', 'Series', '3', 'Jane', 'about', 'before', 'though.Ultimately', 'series', 'less', 'funny', 'more', 'meaningful', 'truly', 'enjoyed', 'getting', 'hear', 'Jeff', 'theory', 'du', 'jour', 'something', 'thinned', 'out', 'here', 'Jeff', 'hilariously', 'neurotic', 'was', 'main', 'comic', 'engine', 'show', 'feel', 'slightly', 'deprived', 'change', 'Additionally', 'pain', 'Sally', 'Patrick', 'begin', 'go', 'resulting', 'several', 'abortive', 'attempts', 'relationship', 'also', 'away', 'pure', 'comedy', 'add', 'emotional', 'weight', 'series', 'well', 'especially', 'made', 'Kate', 'Isitt', 'blossoming', 'portrayal', 'Sally', 'previously', 'one-note', 'neurotic', 'now', 'more', 'fascinating', 'emotional', 'force.Steven', 'Moffat', 'master', 'writing', 'especially', 'writing', 'dialogue', 'taken', 'mean', 'very', 'different', 'things', 'conversing', 'characters', 'creating', 'foot-', 'ankle-', 'leg-swallowing', 'monologues', 'shows', 'highly', 'enjoyable', 'even', 'most', 'deliriously', 'improbable', 'moments.Ultimately', 'fine', 'comedic', 'presentation', 'lacking', 'sparkle', 'Series', '1', 'emotional', 'complexity', 'burning', 'hilarity', 'Series', '3', 'DVD', 'good', 'transfer', 'very', 'clean', 'images', 'good', 'sound', 'let', 'face', '5.1', 'wo', ""n't"", 'add', 'much', 'anyway', 'menus', 'are', 'more', 'same', 'Series', '1', 'special', 'features', 'are', 'improved', 'quanitity', 'first', 'commentary', 'lackluster']",N/A
