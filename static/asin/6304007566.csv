395350,A6HZN83OUPYRN,6304007566,976-ERIC,"[0, 0]","When F.I.S.T and Paradise Alley (a spiritual sequel of sorts to Rocky) didn't light up the box office, it was back to Rocky. This film has much more of a Hollywood feel (Sly's got a tan, training by Franco Columbo, every one has a stylish hair cut) than the original (the 1st had a budget of about $1 million, this was $7), but is still character driven, well written, down to Earth and has an indie feel to it.While Paulie and Adrian (especially the former) take a back seat this time Mickey and Apollo are much more characterized than in the first film. The love story between Rocky and Adrian is not as precious as in the 1st film, but is still important as we find out that Rocky can't fight without the support of those he loves, especially Adrian. It's sweet to see that Rocky himself doesn't even understand this, but Paulie does and (in one of the few character moments he has in this movie) is the catalyst (indirectly) for Adrian's coma.We see Rocky screwing up throughout most of the picture because he just can't figure out what to do with himself and then Apollo, still goaded from his loss (""Man I won, but I didn't beat him!"" he exclaims to his trainer Duke), starts a campaign to taunt Rocky back in the ring. Mick meanwhile agrees to train Rocky again, but is indignant by Rocky's lackluster performance in the gym. It is only when he visits the Rock at the hospital chapel does he realize why Rocky can't give his all and offers a persuasive speech that is one of the best moments in the series.Possibly the best sequel, though Rocky Balboa gives it a run for its money, but this one was made back in the day and has the complete original cast. One of the best sequels I have even seen in any medium.NOTE about DVD issues:Previously ""Rocky II"" had a rather standard lackluster transfer (probably straight from the laserdisc), but for the 2006 Anthology collection it finally received the remaster job and 5.1 mix it deserves.

Picking up on the heels of the first film, Rocky II finds its lovable protagonist trying to settle down and make a name for himself outside the ring.While there aren't any surprises (and the effective camera work of the first is sorely missed), Stallone has effectively recreated the characters and atmosphere of Rocky.  Unlike the numerous sequels, this picture is very assured.  With a run-time of 119 minutes and most the action packed into the last 25 minutes of the movie, Stallone goes a great distance in an effort to involve the audience.  There are a few clumsy scenes at the beginning, but for the most part he succeeds.

Sylvester Stallone is a misunderstood genius. When I see many films, they appear to be very bland. Looking at Rocky II, I feel very overwhelmed by the emotions that come with this film. So many elements were incorporated in this film such as the after the fight, the settling-down, job problems, fate, wife problems, and obstacles. One thing I am really disappointed about is the fight. It looked so fake to me for the first two rounds and partially throughout the fight, but the ending had me to forget about it. There are some heart-felt moments, a brilliant ending, and one terrific training regimen scene, ending him again at the art museum. What I love about Rocky is how dopey he gets, making him lovable. It's a very good character work by Stallone. Also, I like how the atmosphere during the super-fight was set up. I think that was a very authentic put-on. Had Stallone fixed up the fight scenes better in the beginning for the realistic effect, Rocky II would have been a `9' for me. As usual, I am a very loyal fan of Rocky movies, and I'll always cherish the memories. Carl Weathers and Burgess Meredith give another round of superb work. I couldn't been moved deeper by the first two Rocky movies than any two successive movies together.5/11: Although Rocky is the Best Picture winner, I just feel like Rocky II is actually better than the original. The former can be a bit slow, warming up to the point of a great momentum ride. But the former seems to have the memories set in while so many things are happening at the same time. The fight looks pretty good to watch between Rocky and Apollo Creed, heightening the drama effect. Burgess Meredith was nominated for his work in the original, but he is a lot better in second part. If you want to know what ""heart"" is all about, look no further than Rocky II. This one pretty much defined it. I am always a sucker for any Rocky training clip, and if one needed to be motivated no matter what to get going for the day, these clips will definitely get the job done. No wonder why the Philadelphia Eagles halftime shows insist using these clips constantly. All in all, Rocky II is a very memorable picture for many reasons.",5,Rocky! Rocky! Rocky! Rocky! Rocky!

395357,A1YB29BIDULEYE,6304007566,"Bradley Headstone ""Sean ARES Hirsch""","[0, 0]","In most cases of sequels, people tend to like the first chapter the best. I'm aware that in the case of ""Rocky,"" the first chapter is hailed by most as the best. However, I actually think Part 2 was better. As most of you probably know, John Avildsen (director of Part 1) passed the directing baton to Stallone after Part 1 was complete. (Though Avildsen would eventually return for Round 5.) Well, onto the subject at hand. Since we already know most of the characters, Part 2 moves at a much quicker pace. Rocky and Apollo have both been heavily injured from their fight in Part 1. While the winner was not so obvious in Part 1, we soon learn that the judges narrowly decided for Apollo. (Though Rocky's manager Mickey, along with several others clearly feel that Rocky won the fight.) Rocky is not so worried about who won or lost. He is just happy he: '...went the distance.' There is a good mixture of comedy and drama as Rocky tries to go on with his life. We might simultaneously laugh and feel upset at some of the moments. I.E. When Rocky has an employment interview, he is inquired as to if he has a criminal record, to which he responds: ""Well, nothing to brag about."" Paul was annoying and repulsive in Part 1, but he shows redeeming qualities in this 2nd chapter. (He helps Rocky get a job when he needs one.)  Apollo wasn't so well developed in Part 1, but he really comes out in Part 2. While we probably were cheering for Rocky in Part 1, we really had no legitimate reason to dislike Apollo. In fact, we may have even thought Apollo was doing a nice thing by giving an unknown a chance. In this 2nd chapter, Apollo has gotten really malicious towards Rocky over the ambiguity as to who won the fight. Apollo technically won, but even he can not fully swallow it: ""I won, but I didn't beat him."" Apollo wants a rematch to remove the ambiguity, and he uses some below the belt methods to lure Rocky into a rematch. While his actions are not to be admired, he has a plausible excuse for his anger and frustration. He has gotten a lot of uncalled for hate mail. One of the letters even suggested he commit suicide. So while Apollo is more of a villain in this 2nd chapter, we can easily understand his actions. He even offers a laugh during his stage of anger: ""All Rocky has to do is call me, and he can call me collect."" Overall, there is a good mixture of comedy, suspense and drama amongst the many well developed characters. This final confrontation between Rocky and Apollo really outdoes their previous conflict. After seeing it, it's hard to believe that in Part 3, they will be on the same side. I know in the case of ""Halloween,"" ""Karate Kid,"" ""The Exorcist,"" and many others, that Part 1 is hailed as the best. But there are exceptions to every rule, and ""Rocky 2"" may very well be one.",4,Arguably Superior to Chapter 1,1146182400,"04 28, 2006",2006,2810,"['most', 'cases', 'sequels', 'people', 'tend', 'like', 'first', 'chapter', 'best', ""'m"", 'aware', 'case', 'Rocky', 'first', 'chapter', 'hailed', 'most', 'best', 'However', 'actually', 'think', 'Part', '2', 'was', 'better', 'most', 'probably', 'know', 'John', 'Avildsen', 'director', 'Part', '1', 'passed', 'directing', 'baton', 'Stallone', 'Part', '1', 'was', 'complete', 'Avildsen', 'would', 'eventually', 'return', 'Round', '5', 'Well', 'subject', 'hand', 'already', 'know', 'most', 'characters', 'Part', '2', 'moves', 'much', 'quicker', 'pace', 'Rocky', 'Apollo', 'have', 'been', 'heavily', 'injured', 'fight', 'Part', '1', 'winner', 'was', 'not', 'so', 'obvious', 'Part', '1', 'soon', 'learn', 'judges', 'narrowly', 'decided', 'Apollo', 'Rocky', 'manager', 'Mickey', 'several', 'others', 'clearly', 'feel', 'Rocky', 'won', 'fight', 'Rocky', 'not', 'so', 'worried', 'who', 'won', 'lost', 'just', 'happy', 'went', 'distance', 'good', 'mixture', 'comedy', 'drama', 'Rocky', 'tries', 'go', 'life', 'might', 'simultaneously', 'feel', 'upset', 'moments', 'I.E', 'When', 'Rocky', 'employment', 'interview', 'inquired', 'criminal', 'record', 'Well', 'nothing', 'brag', 'Paul', 'was', 'annoying', 'repulsive', 'Part', '1', 'redeeming', 'qualities', '2nd', 'chapter', 'Rocky', 'get', 'job', 'when', 'one', 'Apollo', 'was', ""n't"", 'so', 'well', 'developed', 'Part', '1', 'really', 'out', 'Part', '2', 'probably', 'were', 'cheering', 'Rocky', 'Part', '1', 'really', 'had', 'legitimate', 'reason', 'dislike', 'Apollo', 'fact', 'may', 'have', 'even', 'thought', 'Apollo', 'was', 'doing', 'nice', 'thing', 'giving', 'unknown', 'chance', '2nd', 'chapter', 'Apollo', 'gotten', 'really', 'malicious', 'towards', 'Rocky', 'ambiguity', 'who', 'won', 'fight', 'Apollo', 'technically', 'won', 'even', 'can', 'not', 'fully', 'swallow', 'won', 'did', ""n't"", 'beat', 'Apollo', 'rematch', 'remove', 'ambiguity', 'belt', 'methods', 'lure', 'Rocky', 'rematch', 'actions', 'are', 'not', 'be', 'admired', 'plausible', 'excuse', 'anger', 'frustration', 'gotten', 'lot', 'uncalled', 'hate', 'mail', 'One', 'letters', 'even', 'suggested', 'commit', 'suicide', 'So', 'Apollo', 'more', 'villain', '2nd', 'chapter', 'can', 'easily', 'understand', 'actions', 'even', 'laugh', 'stage', 'anger', 'Rocky', 'do', 'call', 'can', 'call', 'collect', 'Overall', 'good', 'mixture', 'comedy', 'suspense', 'drama', 'amongst', 'many', 'well', 'developed', 'characters', 'final', 'confrontation', 'Rocky', 'Apollo', 'really', 'previous', 'conflict', 'seeing', 'hard', 'believe', 'Part', '3', 'will', 'be', 'same', 'side', 'know', 'case', 'Halloween', 'Karate', 'Kid', 'Exorcist', 'many', 'others', 'Part', '1', 'hailed', 'best', 'are', 'exceptions', 'rule', 'Rocky', '2', 'may', 'very', 'well', 'be', 'one']",N/A

I would hope the number is low. This is a movie that can inspire anyone, not just boxers or athletes. This movie is about taking that ""one"" shot, many of us sometimes get, and doing something with it - really using that chance.Rocky is a film about overcoming what seems to be impossible odds with sheer character; a simple mind does not equal a simple soul, and as Rocky Balboa clearly demonstrates - when you get the shot you've always dreamed of, make it worth every second. Sylvester Stallone did just that - he wrote a novel about getting that one big shot, and it became his one big shot. The actor, director, and producer takes a lot of ridicule from the artsy-fartsy crowd but most of that is just plain jealousy; a forceps delivery left Stallone with a speech impediment, but his brain is just fine.As another reviewer stated recently, if by some chance a person has not seen this film, they need to - it is in a class by itself.&quot;Okay, now make all of that ditto for Rocky II.  This sequel is just as good as the first installment.  Apollo Creed feels that Rocky just got lucky in their first bout, and after a ton of hate-mail arrives on the champ's doorstep, he decides he wants a rematch with Rocky Balboa.  But Rocky's wife, Adrian, wants him to live a normal non-boxing life.  This movie is a little deeper than the first one.  My favorite part is when Mick (Rocky's trainer) tells Rocky they should go knock Apollo's &quot;block&quot; (head) off, and Rocky agrees, and they set out to start training again.After you've see the first one, the second installment is a must!See ya next review.[...]",5,Great Sequel,1089590400,"07 12, 2004",2004,1770,"['First', 'please', 'see', 'review', 'Rocky', 'quot', 'sometimes', 'wonder', 'how', 'many', 'people', 'age', 'twenty-five', 'have', 'never', 'taken', 'time', 'view', 'film', 'would', 'hope', 'number', 'low', 'movie', 'can', 'inspire', 'anyone', 'not', 'just', 'boxers', 'athletes', 'movie', 'taking', 'one', 'shot', 'many', 'sometimes', 'get', 'doing', 'something', 'really', 'using', 'chance.Rocky', 'film', 'overcoming', 'what', 'be', 'impossible', 'odds', 'sheer', 'character', 'simple', 'mind', 'not', 'equal', 'simple', 'soul', 'Rocky', 'Balboa', 'clearly', 'when', 'get', 'shot', ""'ve"", 'always', 'dreamed', 'make', 'worth', 'second', 'Sylvester', 'Stallone', 'did', 'just', 'wrote', 'novel', 'getting', 'one', 'big', 'shot', 'became', 'one', 'big', 'shot', 'actor', 'director', 'producer', 'lot', 'ridicule', 'artsy-fartsy', 'crowd', 'most', 'just', 'plain', 'jealousy', 'forceps', 'delivery', 'left', 'Stallone', 'speech', 'impediment', 'brain', 'just', 'fine.As', 'reviewer', 'stated', 'recently', 'chance', 'person', 'not', 'seen', 'film', 'need', 'class', 'itself.', 'quot', 'Okay', 'now', 'make', 'ditto', 'Rocky', 'II', 'sequel', 'just', 'as', 'good', 'first', 'installment', 'Apollo', 'Creed', 'feels', 'Rocky', 'just', 'got', 'lucky', 'first', 'bout', 'ton', 'hate-mail', 'arrives', 'champ', 'doorstep', 'rematch', 'Rocky', 'Balboa', 'Rocky', 'wife', 'Adrian', 'live', 'normal', 'non-boxing', 'life', 'movie', 'little', 'deeper', 'first', 'one', 'favorite', 'part', 'when', 'Mick', 'Rocky', 'trainer', 'Rocky', 'should', 'go', 'knock', 'Apollo', 'quot', 'block', 'quot', 'head', 'Rocky', 'set', 'out', 'start', 'training', 'again.After', ""'ve"", 'see', 'first', 'one', 'second', 'installment', 'must', 'See', 'ya', 'next', 'review.', '[', ']']",N/A

Case in point:  the Rocky franchise, where at least three of the sequels are just plain silly and nonsensical.  (In one of them, Rocky wins the Cold War, don't ya know.)  Such is not the case with ROCKY II, the rousing sequel to the original Academy Award winning tale that logically replicates what would actually happen in real life--a rematch between Rocky Balboa and Heavyweight Champ Apollo Creed.  The motives are dead on:  Rocky needs the money and Apollo wants to reclaim his reputation having taken the first fight so lightly.  Throw in Rocky's marriage to Adrian, followed by Adrian's troubled pregnancy, and all the ingredients are there for a compelling story, culminating in a pulse-pounding (yet often over-the-top) fight sequence.Sylvester Stallone, Talia Shire, Burt Young, Burgess Meredith, Carl Weathers, and Tony Burton all return to reprise their original roles; Meredith and Weathers especially stand out in their performances.  The best moment of the film is not (*spoiler alert*) when Rocky prevails in the fight; it's when Adrian comes out of her coma and challenges Rocky to ""Win!"".  Subsequently we watch Rocky in his training sequence, with a climax showing the fighter running up the steps of City Hall with half of Philadelphia in tow.  It's one of several feel-good moments in this movie, thus making it a crying shame ROCKY II wasn't the end of this franchise.  All the other offerings are pretenders, not contenders.--D.

Garner,"[11, 11]","Although the original was a major hit, and won the Oscar for Best Picture, I have always felt that THIS is the one that caused the public to fall in love with the character. It was undeniably the one that cemented Stallone's status as a major motion picture star, and even as a writer and director.In parts 3 and 4, he placed more emphasis upon the character's athletic prowess and courage. Later, with parts 5 and 6, he endeavored to bring Rocky back down to Earth a bit, with more pedestrian outings, emphasizing the character's humanity.But it was with Rocky 2 that Stallone got it absolutely right.I honestly don't believe that there has ever been a depiction of a cinematic hero quite like this one. He embodies characteristics that are often overlooked, both in the world of fiction as well as non-fiction. Balboa is honest, and good-hearted, sometimes to a fault. As both writer and actor, Stallone imbues the character with a simple grace and dignity that I find immensely appealing.What I mean by that is.......his is not the humility that we so often see in real-life athletes. You know the sort........the kind of guy who will spend 30 minutes regaling you with a speech about how humble he is. The way I see it, if you spend lots of time bragging about how humble you are, well, then, chances are you are not really all that humble.(are you listening, Evander Holyfield?)If you believe that you cannot craft a film around a noble protagonist, that everything must be drenched in moral ambiguity........well, you won't get much out of this. He is, at his core, a kind man. A nice man. And his virtues are presented unapologetically.But, then again, if being sweet, in and of itself, made you a great hero, Mr. Rogers would have his own movie series.Rocky Balboa is like IRON. And this film offers a sense of that.......a sense  that is more vivid than perhaps any other film in the series(other than Rocky 4).The training sequence is my personal favorite of all the Rocky films, again with the possible exception of the fourth one. If you prefer finesse, you may like the training montage from part 3 better. But if you like brute power, this is the one for you.Hammering away at scrap iron with a sledge hammer. Pressing heavy barbells over his head, again and again. Brutal one-armed pushups. Terrific work with the speed and heavy bags. Duck-walking with a heavy log on his back. Even one-armed CHINUPS!!! Tons and tons of situps.......performed while a young training assistant slaps his abs.And the climactic fight? Apollo's natural athleticism, superior skill, and flamboyant personality......... against Rocky's brute power, granite-like durability, and iron will. It is incredible. They manage to create an entertaining fight, while still maintaining the balance of power from the original. More than ever, this fight makes clear that Apollo is the superior boxer, from a technical standpoint. This notion is emphasized even further by the fact that Rocky has switched to a new, right-handed approach, which he has yet to master, making him even more awkward than usual.Like the first fight-but more so-this is an epic contest, and is ultimately decided by the thinnest of margins.So........what else does this film have going for it? Well, I have mentioned Stallone, but the rest of the cast is ideal, as well. Talia Shire, Burt Young, Carl Weathers, Burgess Meredith........each is perfect in their respective role.This is the warmest film in the series, with a beautiful wedding night consummation between Rocky and Adrian, as well as the birth of their son.It is also probably the funniest, as well. That moment, right before the big fight, when Apollo barks out, 'you're going down!!'........and Rocky simply nods and smiles wearily.......that is so priceless, because by that time, Apollo has been saying the same thing virtually the entire movie, and it's as if Rocky is echoing the sentiments of the audience........it's like, 'okay, i get the point!!'If I were going to introduce somebody to the Rocky character, and had to recommend one film, it would be Rocky 2. In many respects, I believe that it remains the pinnacle of Stallone's career. He wrote it, directed it, and carried the weight of playing the crucial role in the movie.I never get tired of this one. There is a sort of magic about it. Rocky is a character who manages to be eloquent........WITHOUT ever being eloquent in the literal sense. His is the eloquence of sincerity. In that scene, where he is telling his wife how badly he wants money, for the sake of his wife and their impending child, so that he can take care of them properly.........he uses the simplest of language, but it is so HEARTFELT. So utterly without pretense. You can just FEEL how much he loves them, and how anguished he is at his failure to provide for them.There are only so many actors who can convey such brute masculinity, and simultaneously such rich humanity. Stallone is an original, and Rocky 2 may have been his very finest hour.",5,Stallone's Signature Performance,1355875200,"12 19, 2012",2012,5008,"['original', 'was', 'major', 'hit', 'won', 'Oscar',

One of the best sequels I've seen.This movie starts with the end of the first film, and then we see Rocky & Apollo at the hospital recovering from the fight.  After getting out, Rocky tries to find other work to support his new wife (Adrian) but does not want to fight anymore (yet).Meanwhile, Apollo can't let go of the fact that while he won the fight with Rocky, he did not actually beat him.  So Apollo is doing everything he can to get Rocky back in the ring with him so that he can show the world that this time, he will take Rocky down and win by knockout.In case you haven't figured it out, eventually Rocky does decide to go back in the ring with Apollo and take his second shot at the Worl Heavyweight Championship.THE DVDWhile this DVD has no special features, except for the theatrical trailer, the High-Definition Transfer is simply great!

395376,A3N0AXNEZVE686,6304007566,Hound Dog,"[1, 2]","In the 1970's, direct sequels (to extremely popular movies) that were remotely worthy of existence were rare (then again, they still are) with the exception of Francis Ford Coppola's duo of ""The Godfather"" and its Oscar-winning sequel.  Released in 1979, the mostly stellar and poignant ""Rocky II"" has often been maligned by critics over the years as being a virtual remake of the Oscar-winning 1976 original (right down to the climatic showdown with bombastic champion Apollo Creed).To some extent, that criticism is deservedly fair, but ""Rocky II"" is significantly different in at least two respects: 1. actor-screenwriter Sylvester Stallone also assumes the director's chair here with some very impressive results; and 2. the film humbly takes audiences on a remarkable journey of an everyman's life after achieving a seemingly impossible dream.  Make no mistake: the magic of ""Rocky II"" would not have been possible without exceptional performances by the franchise's familiar ensemble: Talia Shire, Carl Weathers, Burt Young, and Burgess Meredith, and, yes, Stallone.  The end result of ""Rocky II"" is that it stands up on its own as arguably one of the greatest sequels (not to mention, sports movies) of all time.Set in early 1976, the sequel follows newlywed Rocky and Adrian Balboa's lives over the course of approximately 10-11 months after the Italian Stallion's amazing display of raw determination against the seemingly unbeatable Apollo Creed.  While the struggling Balboas experience a limited amount of newfound wealth and the birth of their only child, a resentful Creed is elsewhere seething over the public perception that he must have somehow fixed the big fight because he could not annihilate a supposed chump like Balboa.  To Creed's credit, he doesn't fear facing the Italian Stallion once more; rather, he wants to wreak some proper vengeance over the pounding his once-immaculate image has taken.  Meanwhile, trainer Mick declines to train Rocky knowing full well that Rocky has likely suffered a career-ending injury to his peripheral vision in one eye.  Still, one knows that Creed's constant public goading will inevitably force the Italian Stallion to abandon his unwanted retirement to settle unfinished business in the ring on a fateful Thanksgiving Night.Give Sylvester Stallone's acting talents credit here: Rocky Balboa is made incredibly believable as a hard-working, not-so-bright Average Joe Palooka whose perennial underdog status touches a nerve in almost everyone who has the tenacity to never give up, no matter what.  Stallone's efforts are matched by Talia Shire as introverted Adrian, whose quiet demeanor hides the resolve to ultimately support her husband's dream to the end.  Backed by the familiar, vintage Bill Conti score, including the classic anthem, ""Gonna Fly Now,"" the scenes of Rocky's low-tech training, especially another memorable jog through the streets of South Philadelphia to the city's art museum, remain an example of how a film can both entertain viewers and still truly inspire them.The only inevitable problem with ""Rocky II"" is that the Rocky-Apollo II clash's outcome becomes a foregone conclusion.  Yet, it is also ultimately the reason why viewers bought tickets to see this film.  For all participants involved,  Rocky's life-changing victory is a most rewarding experience.  ""Rocky II"" delivers the truly graceful ending viewers deserve, and demonstrates why anyone can relate to the Italian Stallion's poignant (and ongoing) saga.Rating: 8.5/10 (A little slow at times, but it is definitely a sequel worthy of its namesake).",4,"""Rocky II"" Beats Most Sequels to the Punch",1299456000,"03 7, 2011",2011,3599,"['1970', 'direct', 'sequels', 'extremely', 'popular', 'movies', 'were', 'remotely', 'worthy', 'existence', 'were', 'rare', 'then', 'again', 'still', 'are', 'exception', 'Francis', 'Ford', 'Coppola', 'duo', 'Godfather', 'Oscar-winning', 'sequel', 'Released', '1979', 'mostly', 'stellar', 'poignant', 'Rocky', 'II', 'often', 'been', 'maligned', 'critics', 'years', 'being', 'virtual', 'remake', 'Oscar-winning', '1976', 'original', 'right', 'down', 'climatic', 'showdown', 'bombastic', 'champion', 'Apollo', 'Creed', '.To', 'extent', 'criticism', 'deservedly', 'fair', 'Rocky', 'II', 'significantly', 'different', 'least', 'two', 'respects', '1.', 'actor-screenwriter', 'Sylvester', 'Stallone', 'also', 'director', 'chair', 'here', 'very', 'impressive', 'results', '2.', 'film', 'humbly', 'audiences', 'remarkable', 'journey', 'everyman', 'life', 'achieving', 'seemingly', 'impossible', 'dream', 'Make', 'mistake', 'magic', 'Rocky', 'II', 'would', 'not', 'have', 'been', 'possible', 'exceptional', 'performances', 'franchise', 'familiar', 'ensemble', 'Talia', 'Shire', 'Carl', 'Weathers', 'Burt', 'Young', 'Burgess', 'Meredith', 'yes', 'Stallone', 'end', 'result', 'Rocky', 'II', 'up', 'own', 'arguably', 'one', 'greatest', 'sequels', 'not', 'mention', 'sports', 'movies', 'time.Set', 'early', '1976', 'sequel', 'newlywed', 'Rocky', 'Adrian', 'Balboa', 'lives', 'course', 'approximately', '10-11', 'months', 'Italian', 'Stallion', 'amazing', 'display', 'raw', 'determination', 'seemingly', 'unbeatable', 'Apollo', 'Creed', 'struggling', 'Balboas', 'experience', 'limited', 'amount', 'newfound', 'wealth', 'birth', 'only', 'child', 'resentful', 'Creed', 'elsewhere', 'seething', 'public', 'perception', 'must', 'have', 'somehow', 'fixed', 'big', 'fight', 'could', 'not', 'annihilate', 'supposed', 'chump', 'Balboa', 'Creed', 'credit', ""n't"", 'fear', 'facing', 'Italian', 'Stallion', 'once', 'more', 'rather', 'wreak', 'proper', 'vengeance', 'pounding', 'once-immaculate', 'image', 'taken', 'Meanwhile', 'trainer', 'Mick', 'train', 'Rocky', 'knowing', 'full', 'well', 'Rocky', 'likely', 'suffered', 'career-ending', 'injury', 'peripheral', 'vision', 'one', 'eye', 'Still', 'one', 'Creed', 'constant', 'public', 'goading', 'will', 'inevitably', 'force', 'Italian', 'Stallion', 'abandon', 'unwanted', 'retirement', 'settle', 'unfinished', 'business', 'ring', 'fateful', 'Thanksgiving', 'Night.Give', 'Sylvester', 'Stallone', 'acting', 'talents', 'credit', 'here', 'Rocky', 'Balboa', 'made', 'incredibly', 'believable', 'hard-working', 'not-so-bright', 'Average', 'Joe', 'Palooka', 'perennial', 'underdog', 'status', 'nerve', 'almost', 'everyone', 'who', 'tenacity', 'never', 'give', 'up', 'matter', 'what', 'Stallone', 'efforts', 'are', 'matched', 'Talia', 'Shire', 'introverted', 'Adrian', 'quiet', 'demeanor', 'resolve', 'ultimately', 'support', 'husband', 'dream', 'end', 'Backed', 'familiar', 'vintage', 'Bill', 'Conti', 'score', 'including', 'classic', 'anthem', 'Gon', 'Fly', 'Now', 'scenes', 'Rocky', 'low-tech', 'training', 'especially', 'memorable', 'jog', 'streets', 'South', 'Philadelphia', 'city', 'art', 'museum', 'remain', 'example', 'how', 'film', 'can', 'both', 'entertain', 'viewers', 'still', 'truly', 'inspire', 'them.The', 'only', 'inevitable', 'problem', 'Rocky', 'II', 'Rocky-Apollo', 'II', 'clash', 'outcome', 'foregone', 'conclusion', 'also', 'ultimately', 'reason', 'why', 'viewers', 'bought', 'tickets', 'see', 'film', 'participants', 'involved', 'Rocky', 'life-changing', 'victory', 'most', 'rewarding', 'experience', 'Rocky', 'II', 'truly', 'graceful', 'ending', 'viewers', 'deserve', 'why', 'anyone', 'can', 'relate', 'Italian', 'Stallion', 'poignant', 'ongoing', 'saga.Rating', '8.5/10', 'little', 'slow', 'times', 'definitely', 'sequel', 'worthy', 'namesake']",N/A

This film begins where the last one finished: the last round. Rocky has went the distance and is a national sensation. He's a hometown hero for a while but after the excitement wears off he doesn't know what to do now that he's accomplished his lifelong dream. But he soon finds out how scarce job opportunities are in the real world, especially for a punch drunk palooka who can't read.My favorite films from the thousands that I have seen are, without qualification, the Rocky films and my all time favorite actor is Sylvester Stallone. As a reviewer pointed out, this film is as good as the first one. To me, it's as good because of Sylvester's gift of making you feel that he's not acting in this role, that he's dredging up stuff from his own life and that Rocky and he are one and the same. I know what it's like to be made fun of so when it happens to Rocky because he can't read and, in his words, has ""a relaxed brain"" it's one of those things that make you want to see him overcome like his opponents in the ring.Unlike the last film, the quality of the action is up a notch in this film. Also,this was the last Rocky where Sly had the Pillsbury ""dough boy"" look before he really hit the gym and acquired the bronze chiseled action figure body in his later films.

Even though Apollo was given the fight, he still knows he was beaten and wants a rematch and from there the movie is launched into a great sequel.  All of the same characters return and Sylvester Stallone furthers the development of Rocky's somewhat dumb, yet lovable character.  The whole mood of this is alot darker than the first movie as Rocky tries to get somewhere else in life besides fighting and eventually realises that all he knows is fighting, and against all odds and advice puts the gloves back on.  The DVD is again very lackluster in special features, since this is a great movie it deserves a little more than just a trailer, but I won't kick and scream about it seeing as I don't own the DVD in the first place, I just think this series of films deserves a little more, seeing as it's sort of an American tradition.  I'd have to say that the only thing I really don't like about this movie is the sort of ""remix"" of the music workout section of the first movie.

Just some quick thoughts on movie...Rocky II (1979) is an awesome sequel to the first movie, Rocky (1976).  I saw Rocky II in the theater when it came out (as I did with all the Rocky movies).  Seems like yesterday.  I consider this movie to be almost as good as the original Rocky.  The first movie spent time on character development (which is a good thing), whereas Rocky II has already fleshed out characters and things are turned up a notch or two.  After all, this movie features a rematch between Rocky Balboa and Apollo Creed.  Everything about this movie is great - the story, the music, the atmosphere, the action.  Burgess Meredith really turns up the intensity of his character in this movie as well.My favorite Rocky movies are Rocky, Rocky II and Rocky III (in that order, I might add).

395384,A3GRN6J64F2C3X,6304007566,"Joseph P. Menta, Jr.","[16, 19]","""Rocky II"" is a worthy sequel, more in line with the subtlety and realistic drama of the first film than the super-heroics of the later sequels (which nevertheless were fun in their own way).  Here are a few things I liked about the movie (beware spoilers):Character-based consequences and outcomes lent credibility to the proceedings.  Character and heart helped Rocky ""go the distance"" in the first film, and kept him on his feet here, too.  But, in an intelligent move on the part of the filmmakers, it's made clear that Apollo is still the superior, more skillful fighter and would have won again this time.  Apollo's downfall here is that he ignores his trainer's advice to just stay out of Rocky's way in the later rounds and win again on a decision.  But, no, Apollo's temper and ego make him get in close and try to go for a knock-out, which of course gives Rocky the opportunity to try for the same thing.I liked how the movie wasn't afraid to be low key and maybe even a little boring in the earlier going, as we see Rocky struggle with finding employment and living a quiet domestic life following the big fight at the end of the first film.  As both the audience and Rocky's wife Adrian eventually comes to realize, however, maybe a quiet, normal life isn't for everyone.While Apollo plays to the cameras and resorts to some unsavory publicity tricks to lure Rocky back into the ring, he's never reduced to the role of a one-note villain.  You can understand why he's frustrated and wants closure after the unfinished business of the first fight.  All along, though, an unspoken rapport with Rocky, a level of respect for him, is evident.  Apollo's alliance with Rocky in the broader but still very entertaining ""Rocky III"" is therefore pretty believable, as the groundwork is laid here.Like the first film, this one has lots of great little moments: Rocky's wince-inducing attempts to film the aftershave commercial, learning to be quick by chasing the chicken around the yard, and his stopping for a quick blessing at the church right before his rematch with Apollo.  But the movie knows when a big moment is the thing that's called for, too: witness the great training session with all the kids following Rocky up the Art Museum steps and the numerous great moments during the big fight, for example.Like the first film, and the Rocky character himself, ""Rocky II"" has plenty of heart, resulting is a sequel that's worth your time.

395388,A2NQUGGYM0DBM1,6304007566,L.A. Scene,"[0, 0]","Rocky II was the much anticipated sequel to one of the greatest movies of all-time - ""Rocky"".  It continues the story of local Philadelphia Club Fighter Rocky Balboa as he makes a second improbable attempt to capture the World Heavyweight Boxing Championship.  The nice thing about this story is it basically picks up where the original movie left off.  It has all of the same charm of the main characters as well as with some of the lesser characters.  However, it does have some fundamental pitfalls and as a result it does make this sequel fall short of the original classic.This may be a bit of a spoiler: Rocky II picks up following Rocky's controversial split decision loss to Apollo Creed.  Many people felt that Rocky should have won the fight.  As part of his commitment for his love to Adrian, Rocky decides to retire from the ring.  Rocky marries Adrian and plans to set in for a life of living of endorsements and commercials of his name.  In short time, Rocky realizes he cannot handle the world of endorsements and commercials (Rocky cannot read).  Meanwhile, Adrian becomes pregnant and the bills start to mount up.  With public and financial pressures, Rocky agrees to a rematch with Apollo.  Rocky's head just isn't into the fight - especially when Adrian goes into a coma following the baby's premature birth.  Eventually Adrian recovers and encourages Rocky to win.  The movie ends with Apollo and Rocky's classic rematch - and the outcome is very predictable.One thing that flaws this movie immediately is the predictable outcome.  One thing that made Rocky I such a great movie was that Rocky lost the fight.  Even though Rocky lost the fight, he had accomplished his goal of going the distance and found love with Adrian.  With a rematch as a theme for this movie, it makes the outcome much more predictable - and you can guess what happens at the end of this movie.Another problem is that Rocky II has a tough act to follow in terms of the ending.  The ending of Rocky I has to be considered one of the greatest in movie history.  Who can forget the 14th round in Rocky I?  And the scene where Rocky is calling ""Adrian"" as the Ring Announcer is announcing the decision is as emotional as it gets.  Rocky II makes some mistakes right off the bat.  For starters, Paulie and Adrian are not at ringside for this fight.  Rocky leaves Paulie ""in charge"" at home because Adrian is still recovering from her hospital stay.  I thought the dynamics of Paulie and Adrian in Rocky I in the Spectrum were spectacular:  The part where Paulie lifts the ring rope to let Adrian in the ring is classic.  While I understand that you can't repeat that for Rocky II, I still would have found a way to bring Paulie and Adrian to the arena.  When I first saw this movie, I was waiting for Adrian to leave the house and go to the arena - it never happens.  In terms of the Boxing the Choreography is much weaker than the first movie.  The boxing sequences in the rematch in Rocky II seem less realistic than the sequences in Rocky I.  They use a ""double knockout"" to end the fight - to me that seems like a page out of a Wrestling Pay Per View than a realistic fight.Another thing that drags this movie out is the part with Adrian in the hospital.  While I understand it was central to the storyline, it was way too drawn out.The charm of all of the characters is still there.  Rocky is still very much a street-wise character.  Adrian - still shy is showing some signs of coming out of his shell.  Paulie is still the same classic character that he was in Rocky I.  I do think Apollo and Mickey's characters - while good, did lose a little bit of an edge.  One character who I was a fan of was mob-boss Tony Gazzo (played by Joe Spinell) - he is back.  Although Rocky isn't in the loan shark business, Gazzo still considers him a friend.  When Gazzo's character was written out of the remaining Rocky movies, it definitely lost something.  I was disappointed to see the omission of the characters of Mike (Mickey's right hand man), Gazzo's Limo Driver, and Jergens the Fight Promoter (the actor Thayer David did pass away before the sequel).One character that I do like is the role of the Director played by John Pleshette.  Pleshette has a real knack for playing compulsive neurotics (i.e. Richard Avery on ""Knots Landing"") and in Rocky II he basically plays that type of character.  Although his part is short, he does a great job.Rocky II will take place on the Streets of Philadelphia - and that is good.  I do think the ""Rocky Run"" is far superior in Rocky II than in Rocky I - particularly when all of the kids join Rocky on his run.  ""Gonna Fly Now"" is once again the music for the ""Rocky Run"".The music is also up to the same standards of Rocky.  Bill Conti is once again the driving force behind the music.  Probably the most forgotten Bill Conti track in all of the Rocky movies is the theme from Rocky II called ""Redemption"".  This is a powerful tune that really is used well in the beginning and closing credits of the movie.Despite some of the shortcomings, this movie is still a very good movie.  It still preserves much of the charm and flavor of the first movie - and it will keep you interested until the very end.  There are also plenty of memorable quotes and one-liners that you will want to play over and over again.  Following this movie, Stallone would change the formula for ""Rocky"" movies making it difficult to capture the magic of the first two.",4,"Some Weak Spots, but still one of the better in the

I loved the new developments in Adrian and Rocky's relationship, through the not-so-romantic proposal (my heart still melted though) to their son being born (more about him later.)I won't ruin the movie for anyone who hasn't seen it, but there's a whole chunk of the movie where Adrian doesn't do anything. Therefore, Rocky doesn't do anything. The whole sequence was overly long, and could have been cut down a bit.Rocky II follows straight on from the first one. With an overly long flashback to the end fight of the last one. Which may work if you haven't seen the first one in a while, and be needing of a gentle reminder, but I saw these a week apart!There's nothing different between this an the original, Rocky & Apollo Creed are fighting again, we've met all the characters already, and Adrian & Rocky's relationship develops quickly. Adrian gives birth to a gorgeous baby boy, with a head of black hair, which instantly made my womb (that is on the list!) skip a beat. He is so gorgeous! It's pretty much an uplifting story, with Rocky going through a character arc, and struggling with what happens in the weeks/months after the fight. He goes on a small shopping spree, fast cars, nice coat for the wife, nice coat for himself and a luxury apartment that they can't really afford. But the money doesn't last long - not with the rate he spent it - and he finds himself running broke, and itching to fight again.So far, I've seen Rocky I, II, III, IV (the latter of which I nearly forgot about!) and Rocky Balboa.

395395,A1X4JO8EJ1U5BR,6304007566,"Mike London ""MAC""","[1, 2]","ROCKY II opens just where ROCKY leaves off.  Rocky, having lost his title match with Apollo, is back on the streets of Philadelphia.  He's had some success, but doesn't want to pursue the fighting lifestyle for the sake of Adrian, and so tries to make his way in this world with regular jobs.  Adrian and he get married, and even have a son in the course of the movie.Meanwhile, Apollo is itching for a rematch, because, even though Rocky lost, he put up an amazing fight, and Apollo feels his credibility is on the line as a fighter if he doesn't put Rocky away once and for all.  Rocky doesn't want to fight because of Adrian, but agrees to do a fight.  He starts training, but only half-heartedly, and Mick takes him to the ringer for the way he is training, since he is so hung up over Adrian and her attitude toward his fighting.  She ultimately falls into a coma due to complications with delivery of their son, at which Rocky stops all training and won't leave her side.She comes out of the coma with those memorable lines ""Rocky, I want you to do one thing for me.  Win!""  And Mick yells in the background ""What are we waiting for"" and so begins the training montage and the fight.  The fight is much more brutal than in the first ROCKY, and it's only literally within the last few seconds of the last round we find out who wins the match (and it shouldn't be that hard to ascertain who the victory is this time around).There's a pretty accurate summary.  As far as the five sequels go, this is the most like the original film.  All the characters from the first film are in this one.  Rocky hasn't become as successful as he has in ROCKY III, and he is still struggling to get buy.  The film really explores the bond that Rocky and Adrian have together, and it is only thru Adrian's blessing that Rocky is able to really break loose and give the fight his all.The training montage is one of my favorites in the Rocky franchise, though admittedly somewhat cheesy.  Rocky runs along the streets of Philadelphia, and all these kids start following up, and they run up the stairs of the art museum with the famous Rocky theme playing, and Rocky jumps up and down victoriously.  Cheesy, but somehow it works, and you can tell that this is one of the points in Rocky's story where the city of Philadelphia really pulls together to support their favorite local hero.The fight is much more realistic and brutal than the first film.  At the end of the fight, Stallone looks extremely roughed up.  It's probably the worst Rocky looks in all the films.Like most sequels, the film doesn't quite capture the genius of the ROCKY, but it is the most similar in vein and atmosphere of all five sequels to the first.  While the other movies got further and further away from Rocky's original life, this movie is easily closest in tone and atmosphere to the original, and it really does feel like a rematch, or an extension, of the original film, as opposed to ROCKY III, IV, V, and BALBOA, which feel like wholly separate, yet connected, entities.ROCKY II simply takes us more into Rocky's world, and how that world has changed in light of the events in ROCKY.  There are a lot of good lines and scenes in the film, and while it doesn't quite capture the success of the original, the film is just as sincere and just as big-hearted as its predecessor processor.  The endorsement scenes in the beginning are worth the price of admission alone.And of course, it has the immortal line ""Yo Adrian!  I did it!""Rocky has become an American icon, and for those wanting to know why, this is a good movie to watch, even if the first is better.",4,Yo Adrian!

Brutal, (albeit corny, it's a Rocky movie folks, nobody blocks any punches in the Rocky world)and beautifully choreographed by Stallone.

Apollo stated at the end of first film he didn't want to do a rematch, so in 30 minutes you suddenly change your mind? Really? The same goes for Mickey's faith in Rocky.

As the money fades he finds personal crisis is never far away and is tempted into a big money rematch against Creed. Meanwhile Creed, who should fight other fighters, is plagued by suggestions that the first fight was staged to go the distance. Things build to the rematch.Stallone proves that he has got a money making brain in his head by basically remaking Rocky. The story covers similar themes - it's a soap opera with a fight at the end. Here the soapy mush is mostly about his loss of money and decline back into the gutter, while we have children and comas thrown in for good measure. This is all well and good, and Stallone doesn't let it get too mushy. The script has some good scenes and mixes in comedy - my favourtie line being where Rocky is advised to invest his money in condominiums, to which Rocky replies `condominiums? But I don't use them.'This comedy helps endear Rocky to us despite being a bit `punchy'. The fight however - that's where the money is. As in the first Rocky movie, the fight is a huge thing, full of emotion and welling music. The fighting is, of course, nonsense - even sillier than the first film, but with the raw emotion and use of music you can't help but get involved - even if you don't want to! At times it goes a bit far and may look a bit like ego-massaging by Stallone, eg the scene where he is out on his training run and is followed by hundreds of supportive children!Stallone is good in all his roles, the playing of Rocky as a working class bum made good is bang on. Shire doesn't have much to do but she's good beside Stallone. Young is good and Meredith easily repeats his tour-de-force as the grizzled trainer. Carl Weathers is good as Apollo Creed and this is one of his best roles.Overall this isn't a classic but by repeating the basic formula of the first movie and taking Rocky back to the gutter, this remains an entertaining soap that is driven by mushy, if formulaic, emotion.",5,You're gonna eat lightnin'; you're gonna crap thunder.,1166918400,"12 24, 2006",2006,2060,"['Immediately', 'Rocky', 'close', 'contest', 'Apollo', 'Creed', 'drawn', 'fame', 'only', 'find', 'temporary', 'thing', 'money', 'personal', 'crisis', 'never', 'far', 'away', 'tempted', 'big', 'money', 'rematch', 'Creed', 'Meanwhile', 'Creed', 'who', 'should', 'fight', 'other', 'fighters', 'plagued', 'suggestions', 'first', 'fight', 'was', 'staged', 'go', 'distance', 'Things', 'build', 'rematch.Stallone', 'got', 'money', 'making', 'brain', 'head', 'basically', 'remaking', 'Rocky', 'story', 'similar', 'themes', 'soap', 'opera', 'fight', 'end', 'Here', 'soapy', 'mush', 'mostly', 'loss', 'money', 'decline', 'back', 'gutter', 'have', 'children', 'comas', 'thrown', 'good', 'measure', 'well', 'good', 'Stallone', ""n't"", 'let', 'get', 'too', 'mushy', 'script', 'good', 'scenes', 'mixes', 'comedy', 'favourtie', 'line', 'being', 'where', 'Rocky', 'advised', 'invest', 'money', 'condominiums', 'Rocky', 'replies', 'condominiums', 'do', ""n't"", 'use', 'comedy', 'endear', 'Rocky', 'being', 'bit', 'punchy', 'fight', 'however', 'where', 'money', 'first', 'Rocky', 'movie', 'fight', 'huge', 'thing', 'full', 'emotion', 'welling', 'music', 'fighting', 'course', 'nonsense', 'even', 'sillier', 'first', 'film', 'raw', 'emotion', 'use', 'music', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'get', 'involved', 'even', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'times', 'bit', 'far', 'may', 'look', 'bit', 'ego-massaging', 'Stallone', 'scene', 'where', 'out', 'training', 'run', 'followed', 'hundreds', 'supportive', 'children', 'Stallone', 'good', 'roles', 'playing', 'Rocky', 'working', 'class', 'bum', 'made', 'good', 'bang', 'Shire', ""n't"", 'have', 'much', 'do', 'good', 'Stallone', 'Young', 'good', 'Meredith', 'easily', 'tour-de-force', 'grizzled', 'trainer', 'Carl', 'Weathers', 'good', 'Apollo', 'Creed', 'one', 'best', 'roles.Overall', ""n't"", 'classic', 'repeating', 'basic', 'formula', 'first', 'movie', 'taking', 'Rocky', 'back', 'gutter', 'entertaining', 'soap', 'driven', 'mushy', 'formulaic', 'emotion']",N/A

Sylvester Stallone delivered a movie with great screenplay, great characters, a great plot and all together a wonderful movie everyone will remember. Stallone continues the Rocky story with his smash sequel, ""Rocky II."" At the end of the first movie, after the fight ends, Apollo said to Rocky, ""There ain't gonna be no rematch."" You just now that was foreshadowing the events that would happen in the sequel in 1979.The movie starts out with the end of Rocky's fight against Apollo that ends up as an even draw. Rocky happy with the results of his fight and decides he is going to retire from the ring and get a real job now. Plus he has seeing problems in the right eye. So after leaving the hospital, Rocky marries his beloved Adrian. Now, without boxing, Rocky has to find a real job. He looks everywhere. First he tries to do commercials which is a total failure because he can't read, then he tries to get an office job which is impossible without education which he never completed. Finally he lands in a Meathouse which later on he gets laid off. Rocky turns to his only option, the one job he knows how to do, his calling, BOXING.Rocky, convinced he can still do it, but his trainer Mickey doesn't think he has the ""tools"" anymore with a bad eye. Adrian doesn't want him to fight, so there is no support. Then the opportunity of a life time comes up again. Apollo Creed is very upset with the last match's result and accuses Rocky of being just a ""lucky"" fighter and publically demands a rematch with Rocky. Rocky and Mickey get right to work.With determination and strong will, Rocky trains harder than he ever did before to go all the way again with Apollo. This time, Rocky just doesn't want to shock the people, he wants to win the title.Will Rocky do it? Can he beat the World Champion? Buy this DVD to watch and find out.

Sarhan ""matured reviewer""","[4, 5]","Rocky II is the best in the Rocky movie sequels.Released 3 years after the Oscar winning original Rocky, the movie takes place right after the exciting fight between our hero, Rocky, and the champion of the world Apollo Creed, played by Carl Weathers.The difference between Rocky in the first and Rocky here is that now Rocky has become famous for going the distance against the champ, recieves a nice chunk of cash for the fight which he spends on a new house and unnecessary clothes and items, and is getting offers to appear in commercials, which he does. However, the fact that he cannot read results in the rejection from the director of the advertisements, rejection from employers to hire him, and his failure to obtain an 'office job'. Rocky finds himself struggling to keep a job, especially after his now wife Adrian, played by Talia Shire, becomes pregnant. Rocky finally returns to work for Mickey, his trainer, in the gym where Rocky has now become 'royalty'.In the original Rocky, Rocky had to deal with being a nobody struggling to make a voice for himself, in Rocky II, he has to deal with swallowing his pride and keeping his head up despite the lack of a decent job and a humiliating ordeal of holding the bucket for rookie boxers to spit in. In the meantime, the equally proud Apollo will not put up with his fans' harrassments and accusations that the fight against Rocky was fixed and that he has lost his edge. Apollo determines to prove to the world that Rocky going the distance with him was a matter of chance and challenges Rocky to fight him a second time. The rest is history!Sylvester Stallone's script of Rocky II is equally powerful to that of Rocky, only the thrills are more vibrant in the original. All the actors who lit the screen in Rocky return to the sequel. Director John G. Avildsen, who earned an Oscar for his work on Rocky, does not return. It's none other than Stallone himself who directs this one. He will also go on to direct Rocky III and Rocky IV. Avildsen would return to the director's seat in Rocky V.

Of course, there's nothing mistaking the fact that the first one hour and 45 minutes only exists to bring us the final 15 minutes of the Rock Balboa vs Apollo Creed title fight... but what a final 15 minutes!!!The film has a rushed-together feel to it, with lots of filler - the first five minutes are a replay of the final five minutes of the first Rocky movie (as if anyone needs a reminder!!), and then there's a long ambulance-driving sequence as the credits roll, and later some crazy scenes from the hospital, with an enraged, testosterone-driven Apollo Creed ready to carry on the fight right there from his wheelchair! Rock is relaxed and charming about it, talking from a face that's nothing more than clobbered, raw meat, from which emerge highly refined lines of great dialogue in an impromptu press conference:What were you thinking as you went into the last round, Rocky?That I should have stayed in school.Rocky, do you have brain damage?I don't see any.There's a great ""did you give me your best?"" scene in the hospital, and then it's back to life - marriage, showing off, throwing around money, the money starts to run out, then there's the reputation. The injured eye is a problem, but after a while it isn't. Taunts and threats and treaties and training ensue. The film picks up the tiger imagery - the snow tiger at the zoo when Rocky proposes to Adrian, his tiger jacket; it also props up the religious imagery - Rocky's prominent necklace cross, praying before the fight (twice), getting the priest to bless his fight, getting married in an Italian ceremony in the church. Scenes with bad jokes, like the ""condominium - I never use them"" joke give the feeling that there's plenty of filler here. With his impulse shopping and bad driving (and lying about it), we see a side of Rocky we couldn't see in the first film, when he never ever had any money. Bad commercials and comic relief as Rocky dresses up in proto-Rambo gear that's maybe more mock Fred Flintstone.Another area where the second film is different is in its music - they had seven times the budget, and some of that clearly went into music - there's great new music in the first half, as well as the second (the first film had practically no music in the first half). Weird to think that he named his turtles Cuff and Link!Great chicken chasing scene with Mickey - the film really amounts to a bit of charm, some drama, and a touch of actual fighting. At weigh-in, we learn that Rocky is 205 pounds, Apollo Creed 225 pounds. ""Undefeated anywhere in the world."" This time around we see Apollo Creed's wife/girlfriend, cementing that part of his relationship.

Nobody really looks different or anything.  This film deals with some different issues like how Rocky spends his money and fame and how Apollo deals with his victory.  Rocky seems to not understand show biz in this one.  The final fight was big time suspenseful, as in early in the series you did not know if Rocky would win or not.  The plot about Adrians coma hurts the pacing and Apollos journey is rather one- note, but it gets you where you need to be in this movie.  Mickey sure did scream a lot in this movie.  Rocky II is not as good as the first and I feel there was something missing in this one so there went one star.  Buy it if you are a real Rocky fan like myself.  God bless you and have a great day.",4,Rocky beats him,1118102400,"06 7, 2005",2005,814,"['Rocky', 'II', 'story', 'Rocky', 'Balboa', 'pretty', 'much', 'was', 'first', 'one', 'Nobody', 'really', 'different', 'anything', 'film', 'deals', 'different', 'issues', 'how', 'Rocky', 'money', 'fame', 'how', 'Apollo', 'deals', 'victory', 'Rocky', 'not', 'understand', 'show', 'biz', 'one', 'final', 'fight', 'was', 'big', 'time', 'suspenseful', 'early', 'series', 'did', 'not', 'know', 'Rocky', 'would', 'win', 'not', 'plot', 'Adrians', 'coma', 'pacing', 'Apollos', 'journey', 'rather', 'one-', 'note', 'where', 'need', 'be', 'movie', 'Mickey', 'sure', 'did', 'scream', 'lot', 'movie', 'Rocky', 'II', 'not', 'as', 'good', 'first', 'feel', 'there', 'was', 'something', 'missing', 'one', 'so', 'went', 'one', 'star', 'Buy', 'are', 'real', 'Rocky', 'fan', 'God', 'bless', 'have', 'great', 'day']",N/A

The &quot;chase that chicken&quot; scene is hysterical and Apollo Creed is an  even better character in this installment than he was in the first.  Still,  this movie does drag at times as Rocky falls from grace and is forced to  take jobs that most people wouldn't want.  By the time a pregnant Adrain  slips into a coma, some of the viewers will have done the same.

As I've said before, I'm not a fan of sequels although I do make exceptions and this is one of them. When you have such a good screenplay and character depth with a movie, a sequel can be great. (i.e., The Godfather Part II) Rocky II is a very good movie in it's own right despite having the familiar title of ""Rocky"" in it. Unlike Rocky II, far too many sequels have you thinking back to the original instead of thinking about what's ahead and for this reason they fail.",4,Rocky II (1979),1097193600,"10 8, 2004",2004,542,"['Well', 'had', 'be', 'made', 'Rocky', 'win', 'title', 'right', 'course', ""'ve"", 'said', ""'m"", 'not', 'fan', 'sequels', 'do', 'make', 'exceptions', 'one', 'When', 'have', 'good', 'screenplay', 'character', 'depth', 'movie', 'sequel', 'can', 'be', 'great', 'i.e.', 'Godfather', 'Part', 'II', 'Rocky', 'II', 'very', 'good', 'movie', 'own', 'right', 'having', 'familiar', 'title', 'Rocky', 'Rocky', 'II', 'far', 'too', 'many', 'sequels', 'have', 'thinking', 'back', 'original', 'instead', 'thinking', 'what', 'ahead', 'reason', 'fail']",N/A
