Her father dies, and the will stipulates that one of her 6 uncles must be named her next father--and receive her 30 million dollar inheritance.My husband, son, and myself have watched this movie dozens of times, and it never gets old. All parts are funny, but we especially laugh at the antics of the 'photographer' and the 'pilot'. For example, the pilot is about to take a group of women to a conference in Chicago (they're flying out of L.A.) and he ends up losing the map out the window...taking them right back where they started. The funny part, though, is when the pilot (played by Jerry) is fumbling around the steering wheel (which looks like it came off a car) and it detaches...sending him backwards in a gleeful, bewildered giggle as he sails past the women seated in the cabin. He then has to chase the moving plane so he can hop back aboard.This is great family entertainment that never gets old. I wish they made *more* movies like this!",5,Hilarious!

I know that most Jerryphiles cite THE NUTTY PROFESSOR, THE BELLBOY or THE LADIES MAN as his best work, and well they should because those are great comedies.

His hysterical portrayal of ""Captain Eddie,"" an incompetent airline pilot, is worth the price of the disc.

243722,A18RQ2URRGIIEA,6301031458,"M. Hart ""Sci-Fi Fan""","[9, 9]","The 1965 comedy ""The Family Jewels"" was the brainchild of Jerry Lewis, who not only starred in the film as seven different characters, he also directed and co-wrote the film.  The film's story is about an orphaned heiress named Donna Peyton (Donna Butterworth) who has been taken care of by the family's chauffeur Willard Woodward (Jerry Lewis).  Because Donna is a child, she must decide whom she would like to be her permanent guardian among her six uncles that are each portrayed by Jerry Lewis.  After visiting her deceased parent's attorney and executor (Neil Hamilton, 1899-1984, who played Commissioner Gordon in the 1960's TV series of ""Batman""), Willard takes Donna to spend time with the first of her six uncles, who are an odd bunch: an old & incomprehensible sea captain, a bumbling photographer, a would-be Sherlock Holmes complete with a would-be sidekick named Dr. Matson (Sebastian Cabot, 1918-1977), an airline pilot with no sense of direction, a gangster wanted by the law and an unpleasant circus clown that hates children.  Some of the funniest scenes involve the airline captain named Captain Eddie, who owns and operates his own airlines out of Chicago.  A group of women played by Jesslyn Fax (1893-1975), Renie Riano (1899-1971), Ellen Corby (1911-1999, best known for her portrayal of Gradma Walton in ""The Waltons"" TV series of 1972-1981), Frances Weintraub Lax (1985-1975), Marjorie Bennett (1896-1982) want to travel to California. Having missed an earlier flight, they instead obtain tickets to have Captain Eddie fly them there in his antiquated propeller-driven plane.  After finally getting off the ground, the women are treated to a hilarious in-flight film about a dinner-party; but Captain Eddie loses his map and inadvertently flies them in a circle back to Chicago.  Also very funny is the gangster uncle named 'Bugs' who often wears a mask to hide his face.  Once he removes the hideous mask, his face isn't much different.  When he successfully kidnaps Donna, it's up to her 5 other uncles to rescue her; but in the end, she must still decide whom she would like to live with, and it turns out to be rather interesting.Overall, I rate Jerry Lewis' 1965 film ""The Family Jewels"" with 5 out of 5 stars and highly recommend it.  Of all of Jerry Lewis' films, ""The Family Jewels"" is definitely one of his best works.",5,A Wonderful Film Starring Jerry Lewis in 7 Different Roles,1130630400,"10 30, 2005",2005,2351,"['1965', 'comedy', 'Family', 'Jewels', 'was', 'brainchild', 'Jerry', 'Lewis', 'who', 'not', 'only', 'starred', 'film', 'seven', 'different', 'characters', 'also', 'directed', 'co-wrote', 'film', 'film', 'story', 'orphaned', 'heiress', 'named', 'Donna', 'Peyton', 'Donna', 'Butterworth', 'who', 'been', 'taken', 'care', 'family', 'chauffeur', 'Willard', 'Woodward', 'Jerry', 'Lewis', 'Donna', 'child', 'must', 'decide', 'whom', 'would', 'like', 'be', 'permanent', 'guardian', 'six', 'uncles', 'are', 'portrayed', 'Jerry', 'Lewis', 'visiting', 'deceased', 'parent', 'attorney', 'executor', 'Neil', 'Hamilton', '1899-1984', 'who', 'played', 'Commissioner', 'Gordon', '1960', 'TV', 'series', 'Batman', 'Willard', 'Donna', 'spend', 'time', 'first', 'six', 'uncles', 'who', 'are', 'odd', 'bunch', 'old', 'incomprehensible', 'sea', 'captain', 'bumbling', 'photographer', 'would-be', 'Sherlock', 'Holmes', 'complete', 'would-be', 'sidekick', 'named', 'Dr.', 'Matson', 'Sebastian', 'Cabot', '1918-1977', 'airline', 'pilot', 'sense', 'direction', 'gangster', 'wanted', 'law', 'unpleasant', 'circus', 'clown', 'children', 'funniest', 'scenes', 'involve', 'airline', 'captain', 'named', 'Captain', 'Eddie', 'who', 'own', 'airlines', 'Chicago', 'A', 'group', 'women', 'played', 'Jesslyn', 'Fax', '1893-1975', 'Renie', 'Riano', '1899-1971', 'Ellen', 'Corby', '1911-1999', 'best', 'known', 'portrayal', 'Gradma', 'Walton', 'Waltons', 'TV', 'series', '1972-1981', 'Frances', 'Weintraub', 'Lax', '1985-1975', 'Marjorie', 'Bennett', '1896-1982', 'want', 'travel', 'California', 'Having', 'missed', 'earlier', 'flight', 'instead', 'obtain', 'tickets', 'have', 'Captain', 'Eddie', 'fly', 'antiquated', 'propeller-driven', 'plane', 'finally', 'getting', 'off', 'ground', 'women', 'are', 'treated', 'hilarious', 'in-flight', 'film', 'dinner-party', 'Captain', 'Eddie', 'map', 'inadvertently', 'circle', 'back', 'Chicago', 'Also', 'very', 'funny', 'gangster', 'uncle', 'named', ""'Bugs"", 'who', 'often', 'mask', 'hide', 'face', 'hideous', 'mask', 'face', ""n't"", 'much', 'different', 'When', 'successfully', 'Donna', 'up', '5', 'other', 'uncles', 'rescue', 'end', 'must', 'still', 'decide', 'whom', 'would', 'like', 'live', 'out', 'be', 'rather', 'interesting.Overall', 'rate', 'Jerry', 'Lewis', '1965', 'film', 'Family', 'Jewels', '5', '5', 'stars', 'highly', 'recommend', 'Jerry', 'Lewis', 'films', 'Family', 'Jewels', 'definitely', 'one', 'best', 'works']",Family Jewels VHS

I've watched ""The Family Jewels"" many times as a kid, and it still hasn't lost its appeal.Who can resist the wacky premise of having Lewis play several nutty characters running amok on screen? The young Donna Butterworth lends plenty of charm to the tale of an orphaned girl who must choose which one of her uncles she'd like to live with. But it's clearly Lewis' movie all the way as the young girl meets each relative, to comic effect. There are many funny moments in the picture. My favorites? Uncle Eddie, the dashing wanna-be flight pilot of the Great Blue Yonder, who must take a plane load of fussy, jabbering old ladies to Chicago. His flea trap of an airplane is so beat up that it prompts one air traffic controller to say to the other: ""Well, you lost the bet...he made it this time!"" The other is the English uncle who fancies himself as a detective, complete with his ""Dr. Watson"" (the late Sebastian Cabot). And watching Lewis play a game of pool is one of the most hysterically funny things I've ever seen; it's proof of what a brilliant physical comedian Lewis is.

Of course, some of her choices were really strange, as befits anything Jerry Lewis portrayed, but overall it was thoroughly enjoyable.  We had been seeking the DVD for some time as a gift to my husband's brother, who loved it and shared his viewing of it at Christmas when we went to visit him and his wife.

243731,A3T16RF43SXO91,6301031458,Rube Goldfinger,"[1, 1]","Ahh... what a film. Jerry Lewis blends tragedy and comedy so well. The recurring themes of the man/child, the bitter clown, the wellmeaning buffoon who can't help but wreck chaos. Jerry has a very complex and sad side to him, but he weaves them into such absurd, but completely human individuals. This is still a sweet-natured comedy for adults as well as children. No social satire or cynicism here. The physical humor on display is quite ingenius. Better than Buster Keaton or Chaplin easily.This is only the 2nd Jerry Lewis film I've ever seen (Guess the first) and I'm excited to discover more of this underrated comic auteur's special brand of slapstick. The commentary is a huge letdown, not even worth a listen. He just remembers how cute Donna Butterworth is and how much laughter was had on set. Its cool to see the very brief bloopers and screen tests. But you'd think he had more worthwhile material to slap on this DVD. Oh well.
