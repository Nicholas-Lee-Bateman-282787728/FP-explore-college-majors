867866,ARNEUO7BF3J55,B0006H326G,E. David Swan,"[5, 8]","It always turns out that I want to love Lupin III more than I actually do. The problem is that for one brief shining moment Lupin appeared in a masterpiece. `The Castle of Cagliostro' is considered the pi&egrave;ce de r&eacute;sistance of Lupin; some even consider it the greatest anime of all time. All other Lupin III movies are disappointing in comparison to Hayao Miyazaki's fabulous work. There have been some very enjoyable movies through the years and some not so good ones. I have to put `Dead or Alive' into the not so good category.The animation is passable but nothing to write home about. The plot is rather dull and lifeless. Lupin, Jigen, Goemon and Fujiko are once again hunting for fabulous treasure this time on an island that looks like it's composed of a wrecked aircraft carrier or some such thing. A lot of stuff didn't seem to be well explained. The island is protected by nano-machines who attack on sight, not in the way one might expect a nano-machine to attack by say invading your body but by creating bladed weapons that extend from the walls. The nano-machines more resemble living clay. So Lupin needs to figure out how to get past the nano-security while also dealing with the local despot General Headhunter who's also trying to figure out the secret of the nano-machines.My biggest problem was with the amount of time spent on peripheral characters that I didn't care about. I watch Lupin III to see interaction of the main four characters along with Inspector Zenigata not some boring side character. There was also a lot of unnecessary padding in the movie.As a long time fan of Lupin III I have to say that I complain because I care. I want to see a long healthy existence for the Lupin franchise and movies like `Dead or Alive' will probably not bring aboard too many potential fans.",3,Lupin III can do better,1111881600,"03 27, 2005",2005,1820,"['always', 'out', 'want', 'love', 'Lupin', 'III', 'more', 'actually', 'do', 'problem', 'one', 'brief', 'shining', 'moment', 'Lupin', 'appeared', 'masterpiece', 'Castle', 'Cagliostro', 'considered', 'pi', 'egrave', 'ce', 'r', 'eacute', 'sistance', 'Lupin', 'even', 'consider', 'greatest', 'anime', 'time', 'other', 'Lupin', 'III', 'movies', 'are', 'disappointing', 'comparison', 'Hayao', 'Miyazaki', 'fabulous', 'work', 'have', 'been', 'very', 'enjoyable', 'movies', 'years', 'not', 'so', 'good', 'ones', 'have', 'put', 'Dead', 'Alive', 'not', 'so', 'good', 'category.The', 'animation', 'passable', 'nothing', 'write', 'home', 'plot', 'rather', 'dull', 'lifeless', 'Lupin', 'Jigen', 'Goemon', 'Fujiko', 'are', 'once', 'again', 'hunting', 'fabulous', 'treasure', 'time', 'island', 'composed', 'wrecked', 'aircraft', 'carrier', 'such', 'thing', 'lot', 'stuff', 'did', ""n't"", 'seem', 'be', 'well', 'explained', 'island', 'protected', 'nano-machines', 'who', 'attack', 'sight', 'not', 'way', 'one', 'might', 'expect', 'nano-machine', 'attack', 'say', 'invading', 'body', 'creating', 'bladed', 'weapons', 'extend', 'walls', 'nano-machines', 'more', 'resemble', 'living', 'clay', 'So', 'Lupin', 'needs', 'figure', 'out', 'how', 'get', 'nano-security', 'also', 'dealing', 'local', 'despot', 'General', 'Headhunter', 'who', 'also', 'trying', 'figure', 'out', 'secret', 'nano-machines.My', 'biggest', 'problem', 'was', 'amount', 'time', 'spent', 'peripheral', 'characters', 'did', ""n't"", 'care', 'watch', 'Lupin', 'III', 'see', 'interaction', 'main', 'four', 'characters', 'Inspector', 'Zenigata', 'not', 'boring', 'side', 'character', 'was', 'also', 'lot', 'unnecessary', 'padding', 'movie.As', 'long', 'time', 'fan', 'Lupin', 'III', 'have', 'say', 'complain', 'care', 'want', 'see', 'long', 'healthy', 'existence', 'Lupin', 'franchise', 'movies', 'Dead', 'Alive', 'will', 'probably', 'not', 'bring', 'aboard', 'too', 'many', 'potential', 'fans']",N/A
867867,APM06HT7JIPZ5,B0006H326G,"Erik Morton ""Erik Morton""","[3, 4]","Is it true that ""any Lupin III is good Lupin III""?  Well, as a big fan of the series, I'm tempted to say so, but this film was entirely unappealing to me, for two main reasons:1) Lupin and the gang are in the movie, obviously, but it's not their film at all.  The main plot of the movie really has nothing to do with them, and they just show up randomly as a means of tying loose ends or wrapping up a scene.  They're supporting players in their own movie, and with characters as classic as these, that just ain't right!  But even aside from their limited screen time, the movie itself just feels wrong.  Lupin III movies have a style of their own that separates them from other anime (just as the James Bond films' style separates them from other action films), and ""Dead Or Alive"" was sorely lacking in that department.  It seems like Lupin and co. were thrown into a completely different fictional universe than their own.  Almost as if the original script was written for something else, and Lupin was thrown in at the last minute.And a big factor in that is 2) the art/animation style employed in the movie.  True, Lupin has gone through many different looks throughout his lengthy career, but the designs in this movie really missed the mark.  Heck, they were downright ugly at times.  Lupin lost all the sly-but-goofy fun we all know and love him for.  Goemon was just flat out not Goemon; he lost all his previous stoic identity and looked instead like a cliched action man we've seen in countless other anime shows.  And poor Fujiko, it just hurt my eyes to even look at her.  The SOLE exception was with Jigen; come to think of it, I don't think I've ever seen him look better!Now, the movie isn't a total waste of time; in fact, I'd recommend it to all fans of Lupin JUST for the scenes with Zenigata.  Not only does he actually get to kick a$$ in this movie (unlike the total boob he's normally presented as), but the interplay he has with Lupin is some of the best I've ever seen in the series.In conclusion, ""Dead Or Alive"" is easily the worst Lupin movie I've seen so far.  Others in the series weren't so great either, but at least they had the Lupin feel to them.  This movie was just another ho-hum anime actioner.  Again, see it for Zenigata, but don't expect to enjoy yourself otherwise.",2,"Lupin's In It, But It's Not Really A Lupin Film.",1241308800,"05 3, 2009",2009,2307,"['true', 'Lupin', 'III', 'good', 'Lupin', 'III', 'Well', 'big', 'fan', 'series', ""'m"", 'tempted', 'say', 'so', 'film', 'was', 'entirely', 'unappealing', 'two', 'main', 'reasons:1', 'Lupin', 'gang', 'are', 'movie', 'obviously', 'not', 'film', 'main', 'plot', 'movie', 'really', 'nothing', 'do', 'just', 'show', 'up', 'randomly', 'means', 'tying', 'loose', 'ends', 'wrapping', 'up', 'scene', ""'re"", 'supporting', 'players', 'own', 'movie', 'characters', 'as', 'classic', 'just', 'ai', ""n't"", 'right', 'even', 'aside', 'limited', 'screen', 'time', 'movie', 'just', 'feels', 'wrong', 'Lupin', 'III', 'movies', 'have', 'style', 'own', 'other', 'anime', 'just', 'James', 'Bond', 'films', 'style', 'other', 'action', 'films', 'Dead', 'Alive', 'was', 'sorely', 'lacking', 'department', 'Lupin', 'co.', 'were', 'thrown', 'completely', 'different', 'fictional', 'universe', 'own', 'original', 'script', 'was', 'written', 'something', 'else', 'Lupin', 'was', 'thrown', 'last', 'minute.And', 'big', 'factor', '2', 'art/animation', 'style', 'employed', 'movie', 'True', 'Lupin', 'gone', 'many', 'different', 'looks', 'lengthy', 'career', 'designs', 'movie', 'really', 'missed', 'mark', 'Heck', 'were', 'downright', 'ugly', 'times', 'Lupin', 'lost', 'sly-but-goofy', 'fun', 'know', 'love', 'Goemon', 'was', 'just', 'flat', 'out', 'not', 'Goemon', 'lost', 'previous', 'stoic', 'identity', 'looked', 'instead', 'cliched', 'action', 'man', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'countless', 'other', 'anime', 'shows', 'poor', 'Fujiko', 'just', 'hurt', 'eyes', 'even', 'look', 'SOLE', 'exception', 'was', 'Jigen', 'come', 'think', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'seen', 'look', 'better', 'Now', 'movie', ""n't"", 'total', 'waste', 'time', 'fact', ""'d"", 'recommend', 'fans', 'Lupin', 'JUST', 'scenes', 'Zenigata', 'Not', 'only', 'actually', 'get', 'kick', 'movie', 'total', 'boob', 'normally', 'presented', 'interplay', 'Lupin', 'best', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'seen', 'series.In', 'conclusion', 'Dead', 'Alive', 'easily', 'worst', 'Lupin', 'movie', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'so', 'far', 'Others', 'series', 'were', ""n't"", 'so', 'great', 'least', 'had', 'Lupin', 'feel', 'movie', 'was', 'just', 'ho-hum', 'anime', 'actioner', 'Again', 'see', 'Zenigata', 'do', ""n't"", 'expect', 'enjoy', 'otherwise']",N/A

I was thrilled to pick this movie up on Amazon, and it was pretty good.The overall plot of the movie, involves Lupin and the gang trying to steal a national treasure from an ruthless 3rd world country dictator/general. Along the way, Lupin meets up with some allies, and as usual, he meets up with the Femme Fatale' Fujiko. I won't spoil the story, but overall the plot ws pretty engaging. Personally, I found that the plots from ""Castle of Cagliostro"" and ""Farewell to Nostradamus"" a bit more engaging and captivating, but this movie is still very enjoyable.The english voice acting for this movie is pretty good. For some weird reason, my opinion always hinges on performance of the actor potraying Jiggen, perhaps because he is my favorite character. I think the actor in this movie did a worlds better than the actor in the ""Casle of Cagliostro"" , but not quite as good as the actor in ""Farewell to Nostradamus.""This disc is distributed by Funimation, and unlike my previous Lupin movie from them, the disc was in great condition, and worked perfectly. In my opinion Funimation does the best job in brigning Lupin to English speaking audiences.A great buy for any Lupin fan, and like any Lupin movie, I thnink this a great buy for anyone who wants to give the anime genre a chance, without having to subject themselves to crazy hairstyles, and strange magical rodents.",4,Another Great Lupin movie,1345852800,"08 25, 2012",2012,1461,"['am', 'huge', 'Lupin', '3rd', 'fan', 'recenlty', 'have', 'been', 'trying', 'beef', 'up', 'collection', 'was', 'thrilled', 'pick', 'movie', 'up', 'Amazon', 'was', 'pretty', 'good.The', 'overall', 'plot', 'movie', 'Lupin', 'gang', 'trying', 'steal', 'national', 'treasure', 'ruthless', '3rd', 'world', 'country', 'dictator/general', 'way', 'Lupin', 'up', 'allies', 'usual', 'up', 'Femme', 'Fatale', 'Fujiko', 'wo', ""n't"", 'spoil', 'story', 'plot', 'ws', 'pretty', 'engaging', 'Personally', 'found', 'plots', 'Castle', 'Cagliostro', 'Farewell', 'Nostradamus', 'bit', 'more', 'engaging', 'captivating', 'movie', 'still', 'very', 'enjoyable.The', 'english', 'voice', 'acting', 'movie', 'pretty', 'good', 'weird', 'reason', 'opinion', 'always', 'performance', 'actor', 'potraying', 'Jiggen', 'perhaps', 'favorite', 'character', 'think', 'actor', 'movie', 'did', 'worlds', 'better', 'actor', 'Casle', 'Cagliostro', 'not', 'quite', 'as', 'good', 'actor', 'Farewell', 'Nostradamus', 'disc', 'distributed', 'Funimation', 'previous', 'Lupin', 'movie', 'disc', 'was', 'great', 'condition', 'worked', 'perfectly', 'opinion', 'Funimation', 'best', 'job', 'brigning', 'Lupin', 'English', 'speaking', 'audiences.A', 'great', 'buy', 'Lupin', 'fan', 'Lupin', 'movie', 'thnink', 'great', 'buy', 'anyone', 'who', 'give', 'anime', 'chance', 'having', 'subject', 'crazy', 'hairstyles', 'strange', 'magical', 'rodents']",N/A
867869,A1CXVAFS6JUKOI,B0006H326G,Jane b.,"[0, 0]","I fail to be disappointed with this movie.  The fifth theatrical feature for Lupin III, this is the only one that was directed by Monkey Punch himself (who found the job so exhausting that he decided to never do it again.  Pity).  Given the director, it's not surprising that character designs were different, with Goemon and Zenigata, in particular, looking far more like their manga counterparts.  I can see how some might find that too distracting for comfort, but I enjoyed the change.The animation itself is fluid and has aged well, despite the movie being decades old.  The story, while unusual for Lupin III, is still good, paced well (though it does slow slightly in a few spots - nothing serious), funny, very action-packed, and gives everyone something to do.  This is also one of the earlier animated features that portrays Zenigata as something more than a buffoon, which is a shtick that I tire of quickly and is probably one of the reasons why I am fond of &#34;Dead or Alive.&#34;As to the DVD itself, FUNimation has an acceptable, though not impressive transfer (this was a theatrical release - I know the picture quality can get crisper than what I'm seeing on the screen); the extras are minimal, as is the usual with FUNimation, though this does include an interview, which is a pleasant addition.",5,Action and insanity - what more could I want?,1402963200,"06 17, 2014",2014,1316,"['fail', 'be', 'disappointed', 'movie', 'fifth', 'theatrical', 'feature', 'Lupin', 'III', 'only', 'one', 'was', 'directed', 'Monkey', 'Punch', 'who', 'found', 'job', 'so', 'exhausting', 'decided', 'never', 'do', 'again', 'Pity', 'Given', 'director', 'not', 'surprising', 'character', 'designs', 'were', 'different', 'Goemon', 'Zenigata', 'particular', 'looking', 'far', 'more', 'manga', 'counterparts', 'can', 'see', 'how', 'might', 'find', 'too', 'distracting', 'comfort', 'enjoyed', 'change.The', 'animation', 'fluid', 'aged', 'well', 'movie', 'being', 'decades', 'old', 'story', 'unusual', 'Lupin', 'III', 'still', 'good', 'paced', 'well', 'slow', 'slightly', 'few', 'spots', 'nothing', 'serious', 'funny', 'very', 'action-packed', 'everyone', 'something', 'do', 'also', 'one', 'earlier', 'animated', 'features', 'Zenigata', 'something', 'more', 'buffoon', 'shtick', 'tire', 'quickly', 'probably', 'one', 'reasons', 'why', 'am', 'fond', '34', 'Dead', 'Alive.', '34', 'DVD', 'FUNimation', 'acceptable', 'not', 'impressive', 'transfer', 'was', 'theatrical', 'release', 'know', 'picture', 'quality', 'can', 'get', 'crisper', 'what', ""'m"", 'seeing', 'screen', 'extras', 'are', 'minimal', 'usual', 'FUNimation', 'include', 'interview', 'pleasant', 'addition']",N/A
