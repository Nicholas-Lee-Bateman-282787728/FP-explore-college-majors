It seems that everyone in the film is off track, and gradually losing it.  You wonder whether outside forces will crush the main character, Lester Burnham,brilliantly played by Kevin Spacey.  Or whether he will explode.This is one of my favorite Spacey films.  His redemption films like Pay It Forward do not appeal to me.Really worth seeing more than once.  Of course, if the mere setting of movie in ""blissful American suburbia"" makes you cringe, this is not for you.

Then we see a street with a voice from a man with psychological problems. There are weird neighbors for this strange family. Lester has a job in advertising (professional lying?); is he expendable? There is conflict at the dinner table. ""What happened?"" Carolyn is in real estate sales, she has lookers not buyers. [Are her emotions embarrassing?] Jane is a cheerleader with emotional problems. Lester has a fantasy; is he pathetic? Does Angela have a problem too? Is a neighbor a voyeur? ""Oh, gross!"" Are the other neighbors strange? What's their business? [Does it seem like a cartoon drama?] The character of Angela is displayed as if to suggest future failure. Is their conversation real? Does Ricky look too old for high school?The film runs on with conversations that seem weird. What kind of job does Ricky have? Why is Angela so friendly? Are their conversations real? Does the story drag on? [Did people really sit through this movie?] Why is Ricky being tested? Would a dealer trust a new customer? Is Lester slowly going crazy? Can you believe this story? Its like a life of people who will show up on ""Jerry Springer"" or some other freak show. Is there a cure for being stressed out? [Another unbelievable scene?] Why would anyone be scared of Ricky, the friendly neighborhood dope dealer? They show a video that is more boring than this movie. Pathetic? Does the dinner conversation seem unreal? Lester doesn't recognize the music! Spaced out? The film continues to drag on, testing the viewer's patience.Mister Fitts bursts into his son's room for a violent confrontation. [Did it wake you up?] ""There are rules in life."" Another embarrassing scene follows. Carolyn takes up a new hobby; she has that freedom. [I sense a tragedy about to happen.] Is the film going downhill? Is Lester cracking up? Are Jane and Ricky having problems? Will they plan a felony? [Does it seem real?] Can a family be that sick? [The film heads to a crisis.] The framing of scenes is suggestive. [Does it satisfy the hidden desires of the writer?] Are the actions of Jane believable? Or the speeches? Is the writer just creating his fantasies? Does Angela seem credible or a victim of sexual abuse? Is Lester credible in his act? Will a romantic triangle end in violence, like some operatic tragedy? Does the writer avoid the logical conclusion of his story? Is the ending as stupid as the preceding film?I wonder how much of a pay-off is needed to buy great reviews for this film? [Local newspaper reviewers used to praise the films shown by its advertisers.] I did not find it moving or funny, did you? Is it designed to demoralize the viewing public?

This film is very much like a TV sitcom with a few twists. Kevin Spacey has that appealing persona, though his character doesn't have much depth. His wife is an extremely unappealing character, and very annoying. The kids are okay and have some funny one liners. There are some good impressionistic effects such as the red rose petals covering the foxy cheerleader. The lady sitting behind me in the theatre was laughing hysterically at things I considered slightly amusing, and she cried at the end. I have no idea why. The overall effect of the film is the typical midlife crisis, with some bizarre and unbelievable incidents... Also the film explains too much, the mark of directing for the masses (""you know I'm kidding, dont you"") I give the film 3 stars for Spacey's acting, good as usual, but the film has no message beyond what a cutting edge sitcom's message would be.

The older I get, the better this film gets and the more realistic it becomes.  When the film was first released, critics raved about how unique the characters were, but I disagree.  For every character in that film, I have known at least one person upon whom it could have been based.  Because of that, I feel like I actually know the characters.  Instead of being an outside observer, I feel almost like part of the action because the characters' behavior and emotional dysfunction is so very familiar to me.  Anyone who grew up in middle class America will probably know what I'm talking about.  The DVD itself is exquisite.  I don't know how they managed to cram all of that onto a single disc, but my hat is off.

She shows so many different sides to a human being, especially the extreme. She's super peppy and I almost loved to hate her in the movie. Kevin Spacey was pretty good. He plays a depressed man named Lester who's highlight of the day is pleasuring himself in the shower in the morning. In many ways I could relate to this character. Actually, most of the characters are relate able. Lester and Carolyn have a daughter by the name of Jane. She's pretty mean to her parents and wishes they would just disappear. I liked her character, but Mena Suvari's character was even better. I like the scene where some girl says ""You're no goddamn Christie Turlington."" Her response to that was very funny.The ending was quite exciting with many things going on so I was definitely sad when it was over...I'm glad they never made a part II to it too because they probably would have tainted the name.I left a lot out but I'll just say that if you haven't seen the movie, you really need to.

And when you get below the hype there is not much here to get excited about. Take the acting. Kevin Spacey does not act particularly well in this film, in fact he hardly acts at all - he walks through the part, looking every bit as smug as he does when interviewed. To suggest that this role merited an Oscar is to lose any sense of what acting is all about. Similarly with the script: it is not bad, but hardly a masterpiece. In fact it is full of tedious, shop-worn, caricatures, the most unpleasant of them being the martinet father who turns out to be a repressed homosexual (natch!). Shades here of Lawrence's Prussian Officer. But if a writer has to resort to this kind of easy target then he is really not working hard enough. But then the whole script is just too easy. Does the film end up telling us anything new about a mid-life crisis? Not really. Poor Lester Burnham rediscovers the power of lust and a good workout. Good for him.

Seemingly when I discuss my opinion with others, all they will tell me is "" Well wait until your over forty and you'll get it."" Look I GET IT! But if I have to see this movie again at forty it will be too soon. The gimicky story structure infuriated me with its plot device ridden script (Was it necessary for the neighbor's father to be gay? The plotting of the scene where Chris Cooper kisses Spacey was SOOOO cheap!) None of the preformances convinced me one bit. I don't care how many Oscars this one took home, winning an Oscar does not a good film make.

67399,ACAO2J1XCS4FL,0783239408,Alexander Suraev,"[4, 4]","The film is extremely good and it's evident. Less evident are the connotations masked by the title. Of course American Beauty is about  American Dream. But there is a lot more to that film.It's about the time  allotted to to every human being's life and sometimes when the time is over  you can go on living for several decades more. Kevin Spacey's character  somehow feels his time is over. Nothing can stand between him and his  death.The sentiment is not exclusively American. There is a lot of  well-off communities in Europe, Australia, etc.  The main character is  middle class but that does not mean it's just a satire of that social  strata. Middle class man is not blessed with a need to crave for daily  bread - the struggle that makes all existential quests look like something  extra.With all the basic needs satisfied and no time-consuming hobbies  acquired what's left to the 42-year old male? To provide for the family?  But the wife if aggressively self-reliant. Make the daughters future  bright? The little cutie is just enjoying the hardships of the transitional  age and she does not give a damn about the parents' problems. Having  problems is her privilege, it comes with the age.The sexual urge is  taken care of daily. With no outside parties involved.So he dies at the  beginning of the movie and then just enjoys the afterlife - that's Lester's  big secret from everyone. He is dead and it's such a joy to kick the  pillars of the proper middle life\middle class exiistence!The proper  job? Here goes the job - and he gets these $ 60 000 just to demonstrate  himself he can do that. Welcome to the joys of blackmailing.Then the  wife gets an earful of truth. The lame reuniting effort on that  too-expensive-to-lie-on sofa is nothing more than going through the  motions. The resulting sentiment is - Ah, to hell with that! -Why the  restraint in taking the precious gift of the daughter's girlfriend? I think  it's too meaningful to his taste - he's already had her in his dreams in  much more romantic settings. And since he is dead anyway these encounters  are no less valid than the more demanding physical act ahead.He is not  living, he is getting rid of life. Lester's pranks are funny and enjoyable  but very unlikely to carry him through the next few decades.He is that  dancing plastic bag from neighbour boy's video - he is moving, inflated by  the wind, raising and falling, there is no meaning in this, no future. He  is just as fragile and not caring.And there is no any value in  prolonging that dance. So he gladly accepts the bullet that makes his death  more evident to the family and the general public.So there are layers  beyond the American middle class tragedy - and the very funny tragedy that  is.Now about the title. It's open to interpretations. And that's  intentional.Americans are fond of looking in a mirror, of having  American psyche and American way of life scrutinized. They consider  European existential dramas in European settings boring - and very often  they are. The rest of the world is very attentive to the things American -  millions will come to see.Now Beauty. Whose beauty? The beauty of what?  Some will think that's the beauty of the blonde bombshell, some will vote  for the beauty Ricky Fitts sees in everyday life. Besides, beauty is an  universally appreciated word, the natural attention magnet.Join American  with Beauty and you have the mantra-like combination worthy of chanting at  the Oscars and Golden Globes ceremonies, the combination anyone is willing  to elaborate upon.Sam Mendes likes to make use of things that has  already helpend him to become famous. It's so nice to concentrate on a  girl's navel at the film's posters and DVD covers - just like on Nicole  Kidman's lower abdomen in the director's Broadway hit.The film is  classic. It's multilayered and so richly textured you are guaranteed a  discovery with every viewing. The acting is splendid, the casting - superb.  There are no faces we still love but are tired of seeing. That's definetely  a DVD material.Can't wait to get the disc!",5,Once is not nearly enough.,953164800,"03 16, 2000",2000,4090,"['film', 'extremely', 'good', 'evident', 'evident', 'are', 'connotations', 'masked', 'title', 'course', 'American', 'Beauty', 'American', 'Dream', 'lot', 'more', 'film.It', 'time', 'allotted', 'human', 'being', 'life', 'sometimes', 'when', 'time', 'can', 'go', 'living', 'several', 'decades', 'more', 'Kevin', 'Spacey', 'character', 'somehow', 'feels', 'time', 'Nothing', 'can', 'stand', 'death.The', 'sentiment', 'not', 'exclusively', 'American', 'lot', 'well-off', 'communities', 'Europe', 'Australia', 'etc', 'main', 'character', 'middle', 'class', 'not', 'mean', 'just', 'satire', 'social', 'strata', 'Middle', 'class', 'man', 'not', 'blessed', 'need', 'crave', 'daily', 'bread', 'struggle', 'existential', 'quests', 'look', 'something', 'extra.With', 'basic', 'needs', 'satisfied', 'time-consuming', 'hobbies', 'acquired', 'what', 'left', '42-year', 'old', 'male', 'provide', 'family', 'wife', 'aggressively', 'self-reliant', 'Make', 'daughters', 'future', 'bright', 'little', 'cutie', 'just', 'enjoying', 'hardships', 'transitional', 'age', 'not', 'give', 'damn', 'parents', 'problems', 'Having', 'problems', 'privilege', 'age.The', 'sexual', 'urge', 'taken', 'care', 'daily', 'outside', 'parties', 'involved.So', 'beginning', 'movie', 'then', 'just', 'afterlife', 'Lester', 'big', 'secret', 'everyone', 'dead', 'such', 'joy', 'kick', 'pillars', 'proper', 'middle', 'life\\middle', 'class', 'exiistence', 'proper', 'job', 'Here', 'job', '60', '000', 'just', 'demonstrate', 'can', 'do', 'Welcome', 'joys', 'blackmailing.Then', 'wife', 'earful', 'truth', 'lame', 'reuniting', 'effort', 'too-expensive-to-lie-on', 'sofa', 'nothing', 'more', 'going', 'motions', 'resulting', 'sentiment', 'Ah', 'hell', '-Why', 'restraint', 'taking', 'precious', 'gift', 'daughter', 'girlfriend', 'think', 'too', 'meaningful', 'taste', 'already', 'had', 'dreams', 'much', 'more', 'romantic', 'settings', 'dead', 'anyway', 'encounters', 'are', 'less', 'valid', 'more', 'demanding', 'physical', 'act', 'ahead.He', 'not', 'living', 'getting', 'rid', 'life', 'Lester', 'pranks', 'are', 'funny', 'enjoyable', 'very', 'unlikely', 'carry', 'next', 'few', 'decades.He', 'dancing', 'plastic', 'bag', 'neighbour', 'boy', 'video', 'moving', 'inflated', 'wind', 'raising', 'falling', 'meaning', 'future', 'just', 'fragile', 'not', 'caring.And', 'value', 'prolonging', 'dance', 'gladly', 'bullet', 'death', 'more', 'evident', 'family', 'general', 'public.So', 'are', 'layers', 'American', 'middle', 'class', 'tragedy', 'very', 'funny', 'tragedy', 'title', 'open', 'interpretations', 'intentional.Americans', 'are', 'fond', 'looking', 'mirror', 'having', 'American', 'psyche', 'American', 'way', 'life', 'scrutinized', 'consider', 'European', 'existential', 'dramas', 'European', 'settings', 'boring', 'very', 'often', 'are', 'rest', 'world', 'very', 'attentive', 'things', 'American', 'millions', 'will', 'come', 'see.Now', 'Beauty', 'Whose', 'beauty', 'beauty', 'what', 'will', 'think', 'beauty', 'blonde', 'bombshell', 'will', 'vote', 'beauty', 'Ricky', 'Fitts', 'everyday', 'life', 'Besides', 'beauty', 'universally', 'appreciated', 'word', 'natural', 'attention', 'magnet.Join', 'American', 'Beauty', 'have', 'mantra-like', 'combination', 'worthy', 'chanting', 'Oscars', 'Golden', 'Globes', 'ceremonies', 'combination', 'anyone', 'willing', 'elaborate', 'upon.Sam', 'Mendes', 'likes', 'make', 'use', 'things', 'already', 'helpend', 'become', 'famous', 'so', 'nice', 'concentrate', 'girl', 'navel', 'film', 'posters', 'DVD', 'just', 'Nicole', 'Kidman', 'lower', 'abdomen', 'director', 'Broadway', 'hit.The', 'film', 'classic', 'multilayered', 'so', 'richly', 'textured', 'are', 'guaranteed', 'discovery', 'viewing', 'acting', 'splendid', 'casting', 'superb', 'are', 'still', 'love', 'are', 'tired', 'seeing', 'definetely', 'DVD', 'material.Ca', ""n't"", 'wait', 'get', 'disc']",Belleza Americana American Beauty  VHS

67401,AF1VHA7BVWLO1,0783239408,Alexia Komaux,"[13, 16]","A film like this not only entertains while you're in the theater but also drops subtle questions in your head about the nature of human behavior and the gulf between fantasy and reality. After watching this movie, viewers will think long and hard about their own lives as well as the lives of people around them. The movie spells out the social disillusionment phenomenon everyone experiences but can't really grasp.American Beauty reminds us that, like Lester, we really have no idea what we really want. We're not rational creatures as economists assume we are. Our instinct might lead us to perform one action, yet our brains might tell us to perform the complete opposite. We may lust after material belongings, yet how do we know we will still treasure those material belongings once we obtain them? Lester may lust after Angela, yet once he feels her in his hands and finds out the truth about her sexuality, an entirely different feeling comes over him.Ricky Fits, the drug-dealing boy next door, is able to look beyond conventional notions of attractiveness and find beauty in non-promiscuous, solemn girls as well as in plastic bags floating in the wind. When many criticize the movie, they say, ""Where's the beauty in a plastic bag?"" And that's the point. We live in a world of aesthetic subjectivism. What one person finds attractive, another may find repulsive, yet the urge is there for people to assume aesthetic absolutism. ""It's just a plastic bag! How can there be beauty in it?"" Well, a human being is just an aggregation of tissues, bones, and blood. How is that attractive? It depends on how you look at it. Reality is shaped by perspective.Some people criticize the Ricky Fits character because he records his life experiences on tape and doesn't actually experience them. But time moves inexorably in one direction. Time cannot be stopped. In a physical sense the past and the future don't exist. We are only conscious in the present. Everything we do, everything we achieve, every bit of happiness we experience -- they are all eventually buried in the past by time. Recording subjective beauty is a means by which one can attempt to salvage beauty from the past into the present because time eventually destroys all beauty. If you don't believe me, walk into a pre-school and then walk into a nursing home. Remember that all the old men and women in the nursing home were once little kids.Another profound element of American Beauty is in the tag line: look closer. An individual's behavior is not independent of his environment. Humans are conformists by nature, and humans will modify their behavior to assimilate into existing social categories. If any individual dares to stray from the category to which he has been assigned, he is shouted down and ostracized. No one can resist the urge to conform, so why bother? Everyone is nice in public, yet on the streets they blare their horns, scream, and swear. Some boys I know pretend to hate American Beauty because on the surface it seems like a ""chick flick."" They force themselves to watch gory horror movies and show off to others how they can stomach intense violence and excessive sex scenes. In American Beauty, Angela acts like a total slut, as many girls seem to nowadays. In the end, however, she is not what she makes herself out to be. Colonel Fits tries to act like such a man, yet in the end it's all just a giant facade. Civilization is but one giant movie, and members of society must start acting their parts if they want to belong to this civilization. Otherwise, they're outsiders. Try walking into a job interview without a tie. You'll be thrown out. That is the power of convention.What if I asked you this question: What do you want in life? Most people would say, ""happiness."" But is happiness worth deluding yourself for? Carolyn Burnham shields herself from sadness by adopting a positive-thinking philosophy, a philosophy of self-affirming mantras and harsh self-discipline. Positive thinking may help you attain your goals, but positive thinking also blinds you from reality. Is it wise or moral to change the channel when you hear about mass starvation in Africa so you can enjoy moments of fleeting happiness from a cheap romance movie? Self-help is just a euphemism for self-deception. All humans need some complex fraud to distract them from the harsh and nihilistic realities of life, whether it's religion, money, or even love.In spite of American Beauty's greatness, there are problems. Characters are stereotypical, but viewers will hardly notice unless they're ultra-critical. Anyway, exaggeration is essential in satire so that certain points are made obvious to viewers. Furthermore, Alan Ball's original screenplay is slightly edited. The ending is more optimistic and doesn't quite fit in with the movie's overall nihilistic themes. Ball's true message, therefore, is slightly blurred because we don't know whether his message came from his heart or from the portion of his brain that maximizes profits.Problems aside, Sam Mende's debut movie is one of the greatest I've seen. Not only is it entertaining but it is also filled with ideas you can think about. It's an important film for society because there's so much society needs to learn. One girl I knew refused to watch American Beauty because, as she said, ""I'm not gonna watch a movie with a name like that!""Look closer.",5,Death of a Salesman for the 90's,1107475200,"02 4,

The movie is about family, and aging, and the things that motivate people.  Lester Burnham (Spacey) is having a mid-life crisis of sorts where he realizes that his marriage is empty, his relationship with his daughter is severely lacking.  That's when his youthful next door neighbor opens his eyes to the real wonders of the world. This is an incredible movie with awesome performances handed down by all the actors.  At times funny, at times touching, this movie is a true must see. The DVD presentation of the DVD is decent.  The commentaries are informative, the picture and sound are excellent.

If you answer no to both of these questions,DON'T EVEN BOTHER TO WATCH THIS FILM! You'll find it to be disturbing,crude,and  offensive,which is everything it isn't. Times have changed,we're no longer  living in a &quot;Brady Bunch&quot; world,and believe it or not,but the  Burnham's are actually your typically family. Screenwritter Alan Ball has  managed to write a dazzling portrait inside an american family. He makes  everything seem &quot;real&quot;, and as I stated before,there are families  out there like this one,we believe everything we see on screen,this isn't  just due this a great screenplay,we have very good performances here too by  Kevin Spacey,Annette Bening,and Thora Birch as the Burnham's and Mena  Suvari also gives a good performance. There's a line in this movie which  goes something like this...There's so much beauty in the world sometimes I  just can't take it. That one line is the whole point of the film. We have  Lester(Spacey)a man who hates his job,him family and seemly life in  general. And he goes through this whole transformation,for what? He's  changing but is anything else? Everything will remain the same as before.  And it's at the end of the film he finally thats notice that while he  thought things were awful he didn't realize that he was happy. Now did this  movie deserve all the Oscar's it got? No. At least that's my opinion. I  felt that Eyes Wide Shut was looked over(It didn't even get a  nomination!),should any of the actors have won? No. But it would of been  nice to see Mena Suvari and Thora Birch nominated,I don't think they should  of won but a nomination would of been nice.

Ricky, the 18 year old kid next door, becomes Lester's  idol. He is one who appears to have life figured out. Don't stress; lie  only when necessary; and placate the enemy, while laughing  inside.There's also a nod to sex, lies and videotape; with Ricky an avid  voyeur, but more out of curiosity than perversion.

67406,A1TD9JUXG1DGW3,0783239408,"Allie Kat ""sarahphin""","[19, 45]","Nothing here is as it appears. It's about shallowness, emptiness, and fleeting illusions, and as each shallow layer is peeled away, another shallow layer is shown. Lester Burnham throws off the outer layers of his shallow life after meeting a blonde cheerleader who makes him feel young again, and he becomes nave, prone to child-like rage, and shallow. There's a wife from an impoverished background who's trying to maintain her middle-class faade of gentility, an alienated daughter checking out breast augmentation, a philosophical boyfriend who deals drugs, a homophobic neighbour - each with more layers and masks. The rose-strewn nymphet of Lester's fantasies is revealed to be a trash-mouthed snob obsessed with appearances, then later either as just another insecure teenager, or possibly a tease who's playing ole Lester for a sucker. She's one of the symbols for the theme of the movie, which is about the beauty in our everyday lives. But all of the symbols for beauty, like the plastic bag blowing in the wind and the dead pigeon, are empty, or dead, which means the beauty is, too, and we're pretentious and shallow when we believe it's real.I had several problems with the movie. I felt that Annette Bening's performance was over the top for the character she was playing. Her theatrical gestures and rather farcical emotions in every scene didn't suit the hard-working and serious Carolyn Burnham. Granted, we know she's projecting a false image, and we find out she's certainly not stodgy, but it's a jarring discrepancy. We never really learn why the Burnham family members all hated each other, even before Lester's lust for the girl. Indifference would have made sense, but why the sheer hatred for each other? And it was difficult to separate the movie from the hype. Because of the ""hilariously satirical"" and ""uproariously funny"" advertising blurbs that accompanied it, I was expecting something quite different, or at least something with not quite such a message of hopelessness. The characters and the desperation in their situations are more the stuff of pathos than satire. All the characters were worthy of at least empathy from us, although I suspect Kevin Spacey's sweetness made Lester Burnham more appealing than he otherwise would have been. We may like them or not, or identify with them, or not, but laughing at them is cruel. We're always told to follow our hearts, and to do what makes us happy, but the message in this movie is that nothing is gained by doing so, other than false and temporary illusion, like the illusion that beauty is revealed to be.

She never talks to me anymore, probably because she only cares about her career.  She and my dad fight more often now.  My dad is...I don't know what my dad is.  He quit his job technically, but I guess he conned his way into getting paid without working.  We used to be really good, but not anymore.  He's obsessed with my friend, Angela. She's a cheerleader at our high school.  She thinks she's so sexy and brags about all the people she's slept with.  She even wants to sleep with my dad, which I think is gross.  My dad knows this and is working out like mad just for her.  Pft.  Ricky Fates...that's my new neighbor.  He is a strange boy that goes to school and walks around with a video camera taping dead birds.  His father abuses him and is pro nazi.  I think I like Ricky.  Lately, I've been talking to him more.  He is...beautiful.....Oh, and me?  I am just an ordinary girl who's depressed.  I hate my parents because everything they do is for themselves.  They pretend to love me.  And as you can see, my life is not exactly the best........~~~That is the what life would be like in the shoes of Jane Burnham, who's life she believes to be one of the worst.  Portrayed by Thora Birch, Jane is not your typical ""hot"" chick you're used to seeing in high budget films.  Of course, she is not ugly either.  Perhaps...beautiful?  So says Ricky Fitts (Wes Bentley), who is the boy with the camera next door.  He likes to tape ""beautiful"" things, and has a strong interest in Jane.Now Jane's friend, Angela Hayes (Mena Suvari) is your stereotypical cheerleader--a little snotty, a little popular, attractive, and blonde.  Her physical features is what drives Lester Burnham, who narrates the film from underneath the tombstone.  Feeling the adversities of his marriage, job, and family relations, Lester feels dead.  It takes a scent to wake him up from his slumber and live again....a certain scent.....a rose perhaps.....Angela..........This film is about beauty.  It is about stereotypes and judegements.  The stereotypical features that are shown from the outside that are not always true.  In fact, they are far from true.  An ordinary girl may not be as ordinary as you think.  The strange freak with the camera who just got out of a mental house may not be such a freak afterall.  The typical blonde cheerleader may not be as sexually active as perceived.  And the seemingly ordinary parents are soon to be discovered as not quite so ordinary.  The only beauty in life does not come from all the sunsets, sunrises, snowy mountaintops, the accentuating blue sky, or the glow of the silver moon surrounded by millions of specks in the everlasting sky.  Perhaps beauty can be sought out within a dead bird?  A plastic bag?In this heavy movie which contains a bit of sex, drugs, money, power, and discrimination--all themes of drama--director Sam Mendes delivers a powerful, dramatic, yet comedic tale of America's beauty.  He defines America not as a wealthy country with independence and refinement.  Rather than depicting the Eagle that symbolizes America, he defines it with the Turkey--the actual symbol Benjamin Frankilm wanted as the Nation's bird.  Why?  Because turkeys are humble.  America is humble.  That is where our beauty lies.Mendes perfects this rendition of America with the help of cinematographer, Conrad Hall, and Thomas Newman with the musical score (Also did score for Shawshank Redemption).  Both played an important role to depicting the film's thesis.  The cinematography was tender, yet vivid in the most simplest sense.  My favorite shot was of the raindrops falling.  Watch and you'll see.  The music was mesmerizing....nothing more to say but great.  5-star movie, especially for those who rate films on high standards (more than just acting and plot).  This film was deep, comedic, sexy, romantic in an absurd way, and dramatic.

Kevin Spacey plays a middle-aged suburban husband who awakens one day and notices that he's completely alienated from his family, and that his life has lost whatever grace it might once have had. Taking this film a step beyond the &quot;mid life crisis&quot; cliche, his attempts to resurrect his own soul stirs the sleeping &quot;I&quot; in those around him.

67413,A2D6IGKSOBQ3K9,0783239408,Amethyst,"[0, 1]","This movie unfolds much like a documentary on everything that is wrong with America. The story begins with Kevin Spacey's narrative that this is his story of the last year or so of his life. So we start out already knowing that his character, Lester, has died for some reason. It is based on the lives of 2 families, and I think alot of personalities are represented. The over-bearing, prudish wife who is concerned only with appearances and what people think of her. She is repressing her true feelings to fool everyone, and herself, that she is happy with her life. She has forgotten how to laugh. Lester is the husband that needs to regain his self respect and stop living just to survive. Their daughter, Janie, is trying to deal with being different, fitting in and trying to find out who she is. Her friend, Angela, awakens something in Lester and makes him realize that there is more to life then trying to please everyone else. The next-door neighbors has the ex-army, homophobic man, who is more of an abusive drill sargent then a husband and father. He is a hateful person and clearly fears his own true feelings. His son is the one who helps awake Janie and show her the true beauty in life. I think this movie shows how destructive conformity and lack of self-expression is. We live with a great deal of this in this country. We are taught through religion or other means to feel guilt for natural feelings and to conform to what people think of as &quot;acceptable&quot;. At the ending of the movie, we witness that society's violence begins at the place where creativity and self-expression is controlled. The surreal vibe of the movie is brought to life with a haunting musical score and sprinkled with dark and witty humor. Of coarse Kevin Spacey gives a spectacular performance. I am sure people will get different meanings from this movie, but this is what I got out of it.

67414,A928WN8NV03WZ,0783239408,"A. M Robertson ""brother_entropy""","[1, 2]","This movie is one that I like despite its flaws.  It has some great parts to it, and some terrible parts that are easy to ignore the first time, but in future viewings tend to grate.the goodMost of the acting is excellent.  I like Keven Spacey as the downtrodden father and ""former center"" of the family.  A man that was obviously the bread earner at one point in time until his wife started to outshine him and the family lost respect for him in a whole(hypothesis).  Annette Benning is good as the woman is is emulating strength in order to gain it, who felt she was weak and was terrified by it.  So becomes the cold career woman who is terrified and emotionally weak when no one is around.  Mena Suvari was nice as the shallow best friend, who doesn't want to be ordinary.  As well as Chris Cooper playing the unlikable Col. Frank Fitts, someone with serious issues.The basis for the story was intersting.  Characters who pretty much design their lives to hide behind their fears.  The mother fearing weakness, the father fearing he was wasting his life, the daughter and her friend fearing being ordinary, and the former marine being in the closet about his homosexuality.Some of the visuals were interesting, many of them involving roses and Kevin Spacey's sexual fantasies.  But it had a bright, shiny, almost too clean feel.  Showing this upper middle class neighborhood as seemingly perfect until you get to know the people involved.the bad.Some of the acting was great, some of it was flat out terrible.  Thora Birch is attractive in a natural sort of way, but a terrible actress.  I wasn't at all interested in her character, a whiny brat that hated her parents for giving her this opulent lifestyle and wanted breast implants(pick an actress that might need them :).  The love interest was supposed to be this special kid that no one understood, which I didn't either.  He came off as a creepy slob who sounded like he was on the drugs he was selling most of the time.  The scene where he sees god in a bag blowing in the wind was wonderfully parodied in Family Guy.  All the scenes with them just seemed to fall flat.The idea of the marine in the closet was just cheesy, way too 90's.  I don't believe that every person who has something against gays is in the closet.Kevin Spacey's change was enjoyable, but him speaking in soft tones like he was a monk or holy man was too much.The ending was dissapointing in some of the mechanics.  What he saw as he was passing was great, but the dull boyfriend looking into his eyes and the smile he had on his face took away from the other elements that were being portrayed.This was a good movie, but like all good movies it is flawed.  Great the first time through, but doesn't hold up.  It is good for all types, as most people will find someting in it they like, though just as likely something they won't.",3,"enjoyed it, but,........",1081123200,"04 5, 2004",2004,2863,"['movie', 'one', 'like', 'flaws', 'great', 'parts', 'terrible', 'parts', 'are', 'easy', 'ignore', 'first', 'time', 'future', 'viewings', 'tend', 'grate.the', 'goodMost', 'acting', 'excellent', 'Keven', 'Spacey', 'downtrodden', 'father', 'former', 'center', 'family', 'man', 'was', 'obviously', 'bread', 'earner', 'one', 'point', 'time', 'wife', 'started', 'outshine', 'family', 'lost', 'respect', 'whole', 'hypothesis', 'Annette', 'Benning', 'good', 'woman', 'emulating', 'strength', 'order', 'gain', 'who', 'felt', 'was', 'weak', 'was', 'terrified', 'So', 'cold', 'career', 'woman', 'who', 'terrified', 'emotionally', 'weak', 'when', 'one', 'around', 'Mena', 'Suvari', 'was', 'nice', 'shallow', 'best', 'friend', 'who', ""n't"", 'want', 'be', 'ordinary', 'As', 'well', 'Chris', 'Cooper', 'playing', 'unlikable', 'Col.', 'Frank', 'Fitts', 'someone', 'serious', 'issues.The', 'basis', 'story', 'was', 'intersting', 'Characters', 'who', 'pretty', 'much', 'design', 'lives', 'hide', 'fears', 'mother', 'fearing', 'weakness', 'father', 'fearing', 'was', 'wasting', 'life', 'daughter', 'friend', 'fearing', 'being', 'ordinary', 'former', 'marine', 'being', 'closet', 'homosexuality.Some', 'visuals', 'were', 'interesting', 'many', 'involving', 'roses', 'Kevin', 'Spacey', 'sexual', 'fantasies', 'had', 'bright', 'shiny', 'almost', 'too', 'clean', 'feel', 'Showing', 'upper', 'middle', 'class', 'neighborhood', 'seemingly', 'perfect', 'get', 'know', 'people', 'involved.the', 'bad.Some', 'acting', 'was', 'great', 'was', 'flat', 'out', 'terrible', 'Thora', 'Birch', 'attractive', 'natural', 'sort', 'way', 'terrible', 'actress', 'was', ""n't"", 'interested', 'character', 'whiny', 'brat', 'hated', 'parents', 'giving', 'opulent', 'lifestyle', 'wanted', 'breast', 'implants', 'pick', 'actress', 'might', 'need', 'love', 'interest', 'was', 'supposed', 'be', 'special', 'kid', 'one', 'understood', 'did', ""n't"", 'either', 'came', 'off', 'creepy', 'slob', 'who', 'sounded', 'was', 'drugs', 'was', 'selling', 'most', 'time', 'scene', 'where', 'god', 'bag', 'blowing', 'wind', 'was', 'wonderfully', 'parodied', 'Family', 'Guy', 'scenes', 'just', 'seemed', 'fall', 'flat.The', 'idea', 'marine', 'closet', 'was', 'just', 'cheesy', 'way', 'too', '90', 'do', ""n't"", 'believe', 'person', 'who', 'something', 'gays', 'closet.Kevin', 'Spacey', 'change', 'was', 'enjoyable', 'speaking', 'soft', 'tones', 'was', 'monk', 'holy', 'man', 'was', 'too', 'much.The', 'ending', 'was', 'dissapointing', 'mechanics', 'What', 'saw', 'was', 'passing', 'was', 'great', 'dull', 'boyfriend', 'looking', 'eyes', 'smile', 'had', 'face', 'took', 'away', 'other', 'elements', 'were', 'being', 'portrayed.This', 'was', 'good', 'movie', 'good', 'movies', 'flawed', 'Great', 'first', 'time', ""n't"", 'hold', 'up', 'good', 'types', 'most', 'people', 'will', 'find', 'someting', 'though', 'just', 'likely', 'something', 'wo', ""n't""]",Belleza Americana American Beauty  VHS

Nothing short of watching the movie itself will truly convince you anyway. But let me just reiterate: it is as good as the hype says it is.First off, let me say how gratified I was that this movie walked away with lots of Oscars. It was like seeing the Good Guys win after a hard-fought battle, and something that happens all-too infrequently. I need only remind readers of the 10-nomination, zero-statue snub of Gangs of New York in 2003 (which I still find incomprehensible) as a reminder of how rare it is that a deserving mainstream hit drama gets an Oscar.What I find amazing is how affecting this movie is without any truly sympathetic adult characters. Kevin Spacey's Lester goes from downtrodden sod to pedophilic, blackmailing, unemployed, pot-smoking man-child/id. Annette Bening's Carolyn is the materialistic, status-grubbing matron-harpy. Chris Cooper, meanwhile, is the uber-hard-edged stereotypical military-guy, Allison Janney is a ghost, and Scott Bakula and Sam Robards are almost invisible.All this is true, yet you still root for Spacey's Lester as he cashes in, shapes up and smokes out. We yearn with Bening for something to take her away from the somehow painful numbness that is her life as she knows it. The moral stands taken by Cooper's Colonel Fitts, although wrongheaded in many respects, are the only ones in the film, and as a result make him the somehow-praiseworthy moral center. Add to this Mena Suvari as your local despicable it-girl and Wes Bentley as the voyeuristic drug dealer next door, and what you are left with is Thora Birch as the only true, if disaffected, innocent in the film.Yet some of the magic of the flm lies not so much in its content, as its comment on its viewers. Just what kind of people are we, to root for a man, even as he blackmails his company, buys drugs from his daughter's boyfriend and dreams about seducing her other best friend, all in the name of ""finding himself""? What does it say about us in that we find him lovable? And in a medium where not walking out and demanding a refund can be classified as acceptance, how much more so is both a huge box office take and multiple Oscars? Yes, this film has truly lived up to the hype of exposing the dark side of suburbia, but the exposure is not on screen, but in our own hearts.The remainder of this film's magic? That we neither squirmed nor flinched, but instead took it to heart with no questions asked.",5,A true cinematic classic and as good as the hype.,1075334400,"01 29, 2004",2004,2574,"['have', ""n't"", 'already', 'seen', 'American', 'Beauty', 'are', 'weary', 'now-toxic', 'levels', 'hype', 'surrounding', 'then', 'may', 'be', 'best', 'served', 'moving', 'Nothing', 'short', 'watching', 'movie', 'will', 'truly', 'convince', 'anyway', 'let', 'just', 'reiterate', 'as', 'good', 'hype', 'let', 'say', 'how', 'gratified', 'was', 'movie', 'walked', 'away', 'lots', 'Oscars', 'was', 'seeing', 'Good', 'Guys', 'win', 'hard-fought', 'battle', 'something', 'all-too', 'infrequently', 'need', 'only', 'remind', 'readers', '10-nomination', 'zero-statue', 'snub', 'Gangs', 'New', 'York', '2003', 'still', 'find', 'incomprehensible', 'reminder', 'how', 'rare', 'deserving', 'mainstream', 'hit', 'drama', 'Oscar.What', 'find', 'amazing', 'how', 'affecting', 'movie', 'truly', 'sympathetic', 'adult', 'characters', 'Kevin', 'Spacey', 'Lester', 'downtrodden', 'sod', 'pedophilic', 'blackmailing', 'unemployed', 'pot-smoking', 'man-child/id', 'Annette', 'Bening', 'Carolyn', 'materialistic', 'status-grubbing', 'matron-harpy', 'Chris', 'Cooper', 'meanwhile', 'uber-hard-edged', 'stereotypical', 'military-guy', 'Allison', 'Janney', 'ghost', 'Scott', 'Bakula', 'Sam', 'Robards', 'are', 'almost', 'true', 'yet', 'still', 'root', 'Spacey', 'Lester', 'up', 'smokes', 'out', 'yearn', 'Bening', 'something', 'take', 'away', 'somehow', 'painful', 'numbness', 'life', 'moral', 'stands', 'taken', 'Cooper', 'Colonel', 'Fitts', 'wrongheaded', 'many', 'respects', 'are', 'only', 'ones', 'film', 'result', 'make', 'somehow-praiseworthy', 'moral', 'center', 'Add', 'Mena', 'Suvari', 'local', 'despicable', 'it-girl', 'Wes', 'Bentley', 'voyeuristic', 'drug', 'dealer', 'next', 'door', 'what', 'are', 'left', 'Thora', 'Birch', 'only', 'true', 'disaffected', 'innocent', 'film.Yet', 'magic', 'flm', 'not', 'so', 'much', 'content', 'comment', 'viewers', 'Just', 'what', 'kind', 'people', 'are', 'root', 'man', 'even', 'company', 'drugs', 'daughter', 'boyfriend', 'dreams', 'seducing', 'other', 'best', 'friend', 'name', 'finding', 'What', 'say', 'find', 'lovable', 'medium', 'where', 'not', 'walking', 'out', 'demanding', 'refund', 'can', 'be', 'classified', 'acceptance', 'how', 'much', 'more', 'so', 'huge', 'box', 'office', 'take', 'multiple', 'Oscars', 'Yes', 'film', 'truly', 'lived', 'up', 'hype', 'exposing', 'dark', 'side', 'suburbia', 'exposure', 'not', 'screen', 'own', 'hearts.The', 'remainder', 'film', 'magic', 'squirmed', 'flinched', 'instead', 'took', 'heart', 'questions', 'asked']",Belleza Americana American Beauty  VHS
67417,ADQ0MJ38TYB8B,0783239408,Andrew Dobrenis,"[6, 11]","American Beauty is perhaps one of the best examples of the fact that if you can be ""counter-culure"" then you will always have the sympathy of the critics.The story is essentially what teen-agers used to refer to as ""Sex, Drugs and Rock and Roll"". In fact, the story has the feel of what a teenager would write. This is supposedly a critique of suburban culture, but other than being set in suburbia, there is little here that is particular to suburbia.The story's central character is a father who is disatisfied with his life. He lusts after his daughter's friend, his wife is focused on her career, and his daughter has the usual teenage angst over life, etc. His neighbour, who is not the business type, inexplicably reads the Wall Street Journal, (which any young person can tell you is the mark of an evil man). The neighbour's son sells drugs, so that makes him sympathetic and also means that he has a deep understanding of the human condition. Of course, the writers must have realized that drug dealers are not necessarily sympathetic characters to those over 20, so they made sure that the father (remember he reads the Wall Street Journal), is a man who viciously beats his son. In addition, there is another twist to his character that is straight out of an episode of Oprah.Our protagonist, disatisfied with his life, decides to quit his well paying job, which he felt was de-humanizing, and get a job at a burger joint (which is apparently not de-humanizing). He starts to do drugs and listens to classic rock tunes and his life is suddenly better. (See what I mean about the type of story that only a young kid can appreciate?) Alas, his wife doesn't go along with this. She wants to do well at her career and doesn't like it when our hero isn't careful to not dirty the furniture. Clearly, she is not ""with it man."" (Forgive the 60's phraseology, but that is where this movie belongs).One tired cliche after another is brought out to prove what is wrong with America, though frankly, none of the things they are criticizing are particular to America. (Oops, I forgot: Wall Street Journal = Evil).So why 2 stars instead of 1? The acting is quite good, and there is a certain dreamy like quality to the directing that hides some of the juvenile nature of the plot.Don't waste your time with this laughably immature film.",2,Counter-Culture = Good critical reviews,1015459200,"03 7, 2002",2002,2334,"['American', 'Beauty', 'perhaps', 'one', 'best', 'examples', 'fact', 'can', 'be', 'counter-culure', 'then', 'will', 'always', 'have', 'sympathy', 'critics.The', 'story', 'essentially', 'what', 'teen-agers', 'used', 'refer', 'Sex', 'Drugs', 'Rock', 'Roll', 'fact', 'story', 'feel', 'what', 'teenager', 'would', 'write', 'supposedly', 'critique', 'suburban', 'culture', 'other', 'being', 'set', 'suburbia', 'little', 'here', 'particular', 'suburbia.The', 'story', 'central', 'character', 'father', 'who', 'disatisfied', 'life', 'daughter', 'friend', 'wife', 'focused', 'career', 'daughter', 'usual', 'teenage', 'angst', 'life', 'etc', 'neighbour', 'who', 'not', 'business', 'type', 'inexplicably', 'Wall', 'Street', 'Journal', 'young', 'person', 'can', 'tell', 'mark', 'evil', 'man', 'neighbour', 'son', 'drugs', 'sympathetic', 'also', 'deep', 'understanding', 'human', 'condition', 'course', 'writers', 'must', 'have', 'realized', 'drug', 'dealers', 'are', 'not', 'necessarily', 'sympathetic', 'characters', '20', 'made', 'sure', 'father', 'remember', 'Wall', 'Street', 'Journal', 'man', 'who', 'viciously', 'son', 'addition', 'twist', 'character', 'straight', 'episode', 'Oprah.Our', 'protagonist', 'disatisfied', 'life', 'quit', 'well', 'paying', 'job', 'felt', 'was', 'de-humanizing', 'get', 'job', 'burger', 'joint', 'apparently', 'not', 'de-humanizing', 'do', 'drugs', 'listens', 'classic', 'rock', 'tunes', 'life', 'suddenly', 'better', 'See', 'what', 'mean', 'type', 'story', 'only', 'young', 'kid', 'can', 'appreciate', 'Alas', 'wife', ""n't"", 'go', 'along', 'do', 'well', 'career', ""n't"", 'like', 'when', 'hero', ""n't"", 'careful', 'not', 'dirty', 'furniture', 'Clearly', 'not', 'man', 'Forgive', '60', 'phraseology', 'where', 'movie', '.One', 'tired', 'cliche', 'brought', 'out', 'prove', 'what', 'wrong', 'America', 'frankly', 'none', 'things', 'are', 'criticizing', 'are', 'particular', 'America', 'Oops', 'forgot', 'Wall', 'Street', 'Journal', '=', 'Evil', '.So', 'why', '2', 'stars', 'instead', '1', 'acting', 'quite', 'good', 'certain', 'dreamy', 'quality', 'directing', 'juvenile', 'nature', 'plot.Do', ""n't"", 'waste', 'time', 'laughably', 'immature', 'film']",Belleza Americana American Beauty  VHS
67418,ANCOMAI0I7LVG,0783239408,Andrew Ellington,"[4, 4]","Standing tall as one of my all time favorite films and one of the most deserved Best Picture wins of all time, `American Beauty' never loses its impression on me.  I'm forever in awe at its overall magnitude; its presence that is so overwhelmingly absorbing.  From Kevin Spacey's fantastic Oscar winning performance to each and every supporting player the cast is golden and the charisma and chemistry is dynamic and ultimately unrivaled.  What makes `American Beauty' so enthralling and captivating to me is the sheer relatable atmosphere and utter honesty that it portrays.  This is a life not unlike our own, with the same dilemmas and controversies, the same dreams and ambitions and no matter how perfect we think we have things there is always something missing, and sooner or later we're going to have to make a change in order to find our center.  Brilliantly, and I mean that with every fiber of the words very meaning, `American Beauty' fleshes out that very innate desire.The film follows Lester Burnham as he goes through his mid-life crisis, realizing that his wife doesn't love him anymore, his daughter finds him creepy and uninteresting, his job infuriates him; basically that his life in general is far from what he wants it to be.  Through a catalog of events he begins to make serious changes, starting with his growing infatuation with his daughters cheerleading friend Angela.  He begins to work out more, eat better and enjoy a little recreational drug provided by his neighbor's son Ricky.  He quits his job and starts up working at the local burger joint where he can slack off and live life a teenager.  He buys the ridiculously expensive sports car because he wants to and develops an attitude that repels those around him intent on dragging him down.  In essence Lester becomes the man that everyman wishes he could become but lacks the `balls' to do it himself.  Lester is everyman, just pushed to the limit of what any man can take.But this film is far more than just about a single man and his crisis.  Lester's wife Caroline is also going through a bit of a mid-lifer herself.  She's finally come to the realization that she is more than Lester will ever be and she wants, no she needs someone that's a better fit for her.  Lester proves himself a constant embarrassment to her, and his newfound identity is making it difficult for her to function in their life together.  Lester's daughter Jane is pulling away from her parents due to their apparent insanity.  She can't take them anymore, her mothers constant bickering and hysterics, her father's pedophilic lust for her best friend and sudden `cool guy' syndrome.  She distances herself from Angela and forms a closer connection with her neighbor Ricky, a boy who opens her eyes to the real beauty that surrounds her.But both Ricky and Angela themselves offer insight into the growing pandemic surrounding the American public as a whole.  The film effortlessly exposes the common issues that are present in almost every home and exist within almost every human being.  Ricky exists in a household run with a cold fist by his father.  His every move is scrutinized and so he acts out in rebellion by living his life the exact opposite of his father's wishes, albeit behind his back.  Angela is the classic case of girl-hates-self, girl-needs-attention but here she feeds off her characters energy, and most of all Spacey's energy and helps create a character that is in the end so touching and so real.  Her final confrontation with Jane and Ricky is so heartbreaking and her feeling of rejection from Lester is so real.  I actually was moved by her character almost as much as Spacey's.The entire cast, not just Spacey, pull out all the stops here.  Annette Bening is flawless as Lester's controlling and hysterical wife (and I mean hysterical in both of its forms, both hilarious when needed and outrageously dramatic when needed).  Thora Birch is also dynamic as Jane, and Wes Bently brilliantly captures his characters unique outlook at adolescence.  Mena Suvari though really stood out for me as Angela, as did Chris Cooper who plays the domineering and controlling father effortlessly.  Peter Gallagher also develops a nice supporting character, although he comes off more as a cameo, and that's hard for me to acknowledge since under normal circumstances I find him nauseating.  Here though he is fantastic, both charming and endearing while equally repulsive and condescending.  How he manages to pull that off is beyond me.  Each and every actor here benefits greatly from the brilliant script, that's for sure.So, in closing, `American Beauty' is everything that is beautiful about American cinema.  It's engrossing, entertaining, refreshing but most of all moving and emotionally investing.  I often battle my feelings about Spacey's win only because the competition that year was so steep and I feel Crowe gave the performance of a career, but every time I watch this brilliant film I'm reminded of why he deserved his win.  He was so invested, so grounded in Lester that he created one of the most likable sinners of all time, a man who we grew to love and embrace despite his faults.  `American Beauty' will always be one of the most deserving Oscar winners to date and will be remembered every time we look in the mirror.",5,Truly beautiful in an alarmingly tragic way...,1186012800,"08 2, 2007",2007,5320,"['Standing',

67420,A25BZHDKHNGD1D,0783239408,Angelica C. Driskell,"[0, 0]","American citizens are granted certain &#8220;unalienable rights&#8221; under the United States Declaration of Independence, which include &#8220;life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness&#8221; (US 1776).  Although this may be a common theme in many dramas, Sam Mendes&#8217; American Beauty (1990) is unique in the way it focuses on character development and symbolism, rather than portraying a more realistic plot with mainstream leading roles.  Sam Mendes makes his theatrical film directorial debut in this original screenplay written by Alan Ball, which is memorable, impactful and thought provoking.  American Beauty places a metaphorical magnifying glass over a typical suburban, middle-class family and invites us to &#8220;look closer&#8221; at the driving forces behind certain human behavior, while in pursuit of the American dream.  Sam Mendes delivers a beautiful piece of work with a meaningful ending.Lester Burnham (Kevin Spacey) catches our attention from the start by announcing &#8220;I am 42 years old; in less than a year I will be dead&#8230;and in a way, I am dead already&#8221; (American Beauty).  Lester&#8217;s wife, Carolyn (Annette Bening), is a career-driven, perfectionist, obsessed with material possessions, who believes &#8220;in order to be successful, one must project an image of success at all times&#8221; (American Beauty).  Jane Burnham (Thora Birch) is an only child struggling with self-discovery in contrast to her egocentric best friend, Angela Hayes (Mena Suvari), who exudes a false sense of security and sexual bravado.  Outwardly, the Burnham&#8217;s appear to be the perfect American family; however, a closer look reveals complete dysfunction and desperation.  Ironically, the Burnham&#8217;s neighbor, Ricky Fitts (Wes Bentley), is a socially awkward teenager living with a militant father, and catatonic mother, who supports his amateur filmmaking hobby by dealing drugs.  Despite the chaos in Ricky&#8217;s life, he accepts things as they are and has the ability to look beyond superficial appearances.  Ricky recognizes true beauty in the world that most people overlook, such as a plastic bag dancing in the wind or the peaceful serenity of a dead bird lying on the ground.  Ricky reminds Lester to &#8220;never underestimate the power of denial,&#8221; meaning it&#8217;s easier to see things the way in which one wants to see them, rather than seeing the truth (American Beauty).Mendes uses beautiful cinematography including interesting color composition, lighting, and camera angles to develop the film and highlight the relationships between each character and within themselves.  The opening aerial shot of a typical suburban neighborhood, with rows of identical houses, alludes to feelings of apathy expressed by Lester.  Overhead shots used throughout the film allow the audience to see things through God&#8217;s eyes.  Wide-angle shots at the Burnham dinner table show the distance between Lester and Carolyn, as they sit on opposite sides of the frame, with Jane caught in the middle.  Close-up shots are used to emphasize character emotions, such as Carolyn&#8217;s feeling of failure during an emotional breakdown when she literally beats herself up or Jane&#8217;s peaceful smile every time Ricky shows her interest.  Additionally, cheerful family photos are shown between scenes of family dysfunction, which implies that looks can be deceiving.  Mendes also uses soft lighting and muted colors in Lester&#8217;s fantasies about Angela, except for the rich saturation of red rose petals, which exemplifies the serenity he feels in the moment.  In the final scene, the camera pans left to right, in a seamless transition, to capture each character&#8217;s reaction to the current situation.Mendes also employs the use of symbolism in subtle ways that pervade the film.  The colors red, white and blue are displayed in clothing, decor and props, which symbolize American ideology.  This theme is most evident in Burnham&#8217;s white house with a red door and blue shutters.  Additionally, the color red is used to represent love, lust and passion.  Deeply saturated contrasting colors of red and blue reflect the deeply saturated and contrasting emotions of the characters.  Carolyn is frequently portrayed in red, while Lester is portrayed in blue to emphasize their opposition of one another.  Red roses are used in the opening scene, with Carolyn trimming the stems, and also found throughout the Burnham&#8217;s house.  The rose is a symbol of love and beauty, while the thorns remind us that love is painful.  Rose petals are used in Lester&#8217;s fantasies, which add a cerebral perspective and gives deeper meaning to the film.  The rose petals become a soft landing place for his subconscious mind, which can be seen from the moment Lester lays eyes on Angela and flood of rose petals flow out of her sweater.  Lester also pulls a rose petal out of his mouth after his illusionary kiss with Angela.  These petals symbolize his new found passion for life and are prominent in each of Lester&#8217;s fantasies.American Beauty is an American tragedy in which each character suffers in some way due to a tragic flaw, moral weakness, or inability to cope with their circumstances.  The multi-dimensional cast of characters intrigues the audience with their cathartic performances that viewers can identify with and have a restoring emotional experience.  Lester&#8217;s poignant reflection of life after death successfully conveys the theme to the audience.  Lying peacefully in a crimson pool of blood, Lester reminds us that &#8220;there's so much beauty in the world,&#8221; we should feel grateful for every single moment of life no matter how stupid it seems (American Beauty).  Mendes does a wonderful job of keeping the focus on life rather than death, which has a greater impact on the viewing experience.Works CitedAmerican Beauty. Dir. Sam Mendes. DreamWorks, 1999.

Outside of the demented imaginations of liberal pinko prevert screenwriters there is no allusion to contextual rectitude. (Thanks for the commentary guys.)  Let's just take a look at the sordid view of our society that this movie propagates.  They expect us to actually believe in: greedy, amoral, meglomaniacal real estate agents trouncing through suburbia like hyenas in heat; precociously neurotic high school kids swearing, selling drugs to each other and obsessing over forbidden sex; disillusioned, middle-aged men fantasizing about over-sexed, buffed out teenage girls; decent and intelligent gay men trying to get along with their neighbors; fascistic, closet-case marine corps officers abusing their wives and children; and finally, the offspring of decadent, pathologically materialistic, dysfunctional, middle class parents dreaming of a world without hypocrisy and social Darwinist oppression.

67428,ATXO4UA7N1HDC,0783239408,Ari Weiss,"[3, 4]","American Beauty: rated R, 1 hour and 58 minutesAmerican Beauty is Spacey at his best...again, but wait, there's more. This time, a team of actors and actresses that nearly show him up accompany Spacey. A true movie ensemble including Annette Benning, Chris Cooper, Thora Birch, and Wes Bentley threaten to steal the spotlight.A seemingly typical suburban neighborhood gets an in-depth look beneath the shallow surface. An ordinary, financially well-to-do family is followed through the point of view of the father (extraordinary Kevin Spacey). He narrates his life and fills the audience in on all of his quirks, flaws, and limitations, as well as those of his wife (Annette Benning), and daughter (Thora Birch). These introductory moments in which Spacey reveals a side of his family that no one in the neighborhood dare discover are executed with a touch of comical ingenuity. To glance beyond this comical absurdity exposes a miserable, dysfunctional, household with no escape from their perpetual sorrows. When the movie is seen through this perspective, it loses its humor, but picks up a deeper, more real meaning. This double angle that persists throughout the movie is one of the elements that make this movie so brilliantly interesting. To reassess the movie allows the deeper, more serious meaning to become more prominent, but while watching in the moment, laughter is most likely to be the initial overwhelming response. The movie is incredibly unique in its entire concept. It is so clever, serious, and funny all in one. No other movie has risked implementing such an unlikely combination. The result is absolute, inarguable success.American Beauty deals with the true nature of life, attempting to enlighten its viewers, by doing so in a charming, eloquent manner, as opposed to shoving it down our throats. `What is beauty?' is the question that this movie raises. Is it found in a nice looking house, a good-natured person, a flower, a gorgeous woman, or is it more abstract than that? What if beauty was found in exceptional circumstances that cannot be reasonably accounted for, or what if it were merely in understanding? All of these ideas are aroused; none are straightforwardly answered, though one theory that seems to come across clearly is that beauty is in the eye of the beholder.Every moment of every scene enacted in American Beauty is done with such precision and vitality, that they all become memorable without exception. The characters are all well developed. More interestingly, each character is severely flawed, some more than others, but each is forced to account for these flaws. The character of Kevin Spacey, Lester Burnham is one of great complexity, as are most in the movie. Lester has just decided that he would like to do more with his pathetic life than laze around and remain to be pathetic for eternity. He revives a suppressed, vivacious identity that he soon embraces. With this new livelihood, comes a price. His wife and daughter who have grown exceedingly distant through the years are not ready to take on a whole new Lester Burnham.To say that American Beauty exhibited superb acting throughout would be a major understatement. Kevin Spacey was utterly astonishing in his ability to convey the character of Lester Burnham. Annette Benning as Lester's wife, Carolyn Burnham was as she has never been seen before. In comparison to her flaky, overdone role in The Siege, she seemed to have undergone some sort of miraculous endowment of acting skill, as well as passion for her part. She worked beautifully with Spacey, as did the daughter, Thora Birch, and the rest of the crew. No one was really better than anyone else because each actor played his role with such grace and dignity that none can be considered second-rate. The rest of the credit is awarded to first-time feature film director Sam Mendes who envisioned the entire film. It was he who set the mood, worked on the unique camera angles, informed all of the actors of how there characters were to be projected, and it was he who incorporated all of the minute fine points into a giant masterpiece.No complaints can be made of the unblemished American Beauty. It deserves Oscar attention to the highest degree.",5,What Lies Beneath The Surface,1001116800,"09 22, 2001",2001,4227,"['American', 'Beauty', 'rated', 'R', '1', 'hour', '58', 'minutesAmerican', 'Beauty', 'Spacey', 'best', 'again', 'wait', 'more', 'time', 'team', 'actors', 'actresses', 'nearly', 'show', 'up', 'accompany', 'Spacey', 'A', 'true', 'movie', 'ensemble', 'including', 'Annette', 'Benning', 'Chris', 'Cooper', 'Thora', 'Birch', 'Wes', 'Bentley', 'threaten', 'steal', 'spotlight.A', 'seemingly', 'typical', 'suburban', 'neighborhood', 'in-depth', 'look', 'shallow', 'surface', 'ordinary', 'financially', 'well-to-do', 'family', 'followed', 'point', 'view', 'father', 'extraordinary', 'Kevin', 'Spacey', 'life', 'audience', 'quirks', 'flaws', 'limitations', 'as', 'well', 'wife', 'Annette', 'Benning', 'daughter', 'Thora', 'Birch', 'introductory', 'moments', 'Spacey', 'side', 'family', 'one', 'neighborhood', 'dare', 'discover', 'are', 'executed', 'touch', 'comical', 'ingenuity', 'glance', 'comical', 'absurdity', 'miserable', 'dysfunctional', 'household', 'escape', 'perpetual', 'sorrows', 'When', 'movie', 'seen', 'perspective', 'humor', 'up', 'deeper', 'more', 'real', 'meaning', 'double', 'angle', 'movie', 'one', 'elements', 'make', 'movie', 'so', 'brilliantly', 'interesting', 'reassess', 'movie', 'deeper', 'more', 'serious', 'meaning', 'become', 'more', 'prominent', 'watching', 'moment', 'laughter', 'most', 'likely', 'be', 'initial', 'overwhelming', 'response', 'movie', 'incredibly', 'unique', 'entire', 'concept', 'so', 'clever', 'serious', 'funny', 'one', 'other', 'movie', 'risked', 'implementing', 'such', 'unlikely', 'combination', 'result', 'absolute', 'inarguable', 'success.American', 'Beauty', 'deals', 'true', 'nature', 'life', 'attempting', 'enlighten', 'viewers', 'doing', 'so', 'charming', 'eloquent', 'manner', 'opposed', 'shoving', 'down', 'throats', 'What', 'beauty', 'question', 'movie', 'found', 'nice', 'looking', 'house', 'good-natured', 'person', 'flower', 'gorgeous', 'woman', 'more', 'abstract', 'What', 'beauty', 'was', 'found', 'exceptional', 'circumstances', 'can', 'not', 'be', 'reasonably', 'accounted', 'what', 'were', 'merely', 'understanding', 'ideas', 'are', 'aroused', 'none', 'are', 'straightforwardly', 'answered', 'one', 'theory', 'come', 'clearly', 'beauty', 'eye', 'beholder.Every', 'moment', 'scene', 'enacted', 'American', 'Beauty', 'done', 'such', 'precision', 'vitality', 'become', 'memorable', 'exception', 'characters', 'are', 'well', 'developed', 'More', 'interestingly', 'character', 'severely', 'flawed', 'more', 'others', 'forced', 'account', 'flaws', 'character', 'Kevin', 'Spacey', 'Lester', 'Burnham', 'one', 'great', 'complexity', 'are', 'most', 'movie', 'Lester', 'just', 'decided', 'would', 'like', 'do', 'more', 'pathetic', 'life', 'laze', 'remain', 'be', 'pathetic', 'eternity', 'suppressed', 'vivacious', 'identity', 'soon', 'new', 'livelihood', 'price', 'wife', 'daughter', 'who', 'have', 'grown', 'exceedingly', 'distant', 'years', 'are', 'not', 'ready', 'take', 'whole', 'new', 'Lester', 'Burnham.To', 'say', 'American', 'Beauty', 'exhibited', 'superb', 'acting', 'would', 'be', 'major', 'understatement', 'Kevin', 'Spacey', 'was', 'utterly', 'astonishing', 'ability', 'convey', 'character', 'Lester', 'Burnham', 'Annette', 'Benning', 'Lester', 'wife', 'Carolyn', 'Burnham', 'was', 'never', 'been', 'seen', 'before', 'comparison', 'flaky', 'overdone', 'role', 'Siege', 'seemed', 'have', 'undergone', 'sort', 'miraculous', 'endowment', 'acting', 'skill', 'as', 'well', 'passion', 'part', 'worked', 'beautifully', 'Spacey', 'did', 'daughter', 'Thora', 'Birch', 'rest', 'crew', 'one', 'was', 'really', 'better', 'anyone', 'else', 'actor', 'played', 'role', 'such', 'grace', 'dignity', 'none', 'can', 'be', 'considered', 'second-rate', 'rest', 'credit', 'awarded', 'first-time', 'feature', 'film', 'director', 'Sam', 'Mendes', 'who', 'envisioned', 'entire', 'film', 'was', 'who', 'set', 'mood', 'worked', 'unique', 'camera', 'angles', 'informed', 'actors', 'how', 'characters', 'were', 'be', 'projected', 'was', 'who', 'incorporated', 'minute', 'fine', 'points', 'giant', 'masterpiece.No', 'complaints', 'can', 'be', 'made', 'unblemished', 'American', 'Beauty', 'Oscar', 'attention', 'highest', 'degree']",Belleza Americana American Beauty  VHS

Mesa,"[2, 4]","I knew this film was going to be Oscar material when the lady sitting behind me in the theatre walked out in disgust due to the opening shower scene.The second clue was another lady who sat through the two hours plus  and was crying after the tragic finale ! This film (almost like no other)  has evoked various emotional responses in different people on all different  levels . This is the kind of writing and directing that is so profound it  leaves the viewer in almost a dazed state of awe. A film that can contain a  strong element of dark humor and biting sarcasm along with drama and  tragedy is a rare gem; American Beauty is this gem ! The reasons why some  viewers found this film so offensive was beacuse it either hit too close to  home or they have never come across anyone in their lives who were as human  as these characters. Just because the Joneses or the Smiths next door have  the &quot;American Dream&quot; does not mean that there were not certain  &quot;sacrifices&quot; made to achieve that dream. In other words, what  lengths do we as an American society go to to achieve the ideal American  financial and perfect family status. There is a difference between  sacrificing free weekends for overtime at a job to send your kids to  college versus sacrificing your morals or your mother to spite a famiy  member or acquaintance.The only other tongue-in-cheek message American  Beauty may emit is maybe we shouldn't get too friendly with our neighbors  !...As for the abundance and wealth of talent, Spacey, Benning, and  Birch are the film's treasures as well.

I had a chance to watch DVD version of the movie recently and its never boring rather, I find it more thoughful.No doubt - this is Kevin Spacey's best. Lot of venueus for exhibiting his acting skills. So many to point out - while at the fast food drive through meeting his wife with her boy friend, while clarifying the neighbor that he is not 'that', while talking to her daughter's friend after the game, and the best of all, while hearing that it is her first time. I don't see Kevin in the movie but Lester himself. He has lived the character. Class of acting! The Oscar he got was well acclaimed!Interestingly most of the crew in the movie have excellently acted - be it her daughter or wife or the neighbor or neighbor's father.There is enough fun in the movie - the dialogue commenting the two partners jogging with his neighbor is one best example. Cinematography - another wonder in the movie. The flying dirt bag shot by the boy is a beautiful poem of its own. Dialogues, Direction, Screenplay, Story - everything deservers appreciation - Flawless.If at all critics complain about too much of reality or too much of abnormal characters in the movie - well! life is not normal always. Not everyone is perfect! And everyone with our own idiosyncrasies. But inside, the movie is very deep and requires varied serious thoughts.And we cannot forget the silent serious and thoughtful emotion existing throughout the movie.

You then hear that his daughter  is discussing getting someone to kill him.  Great set up for a movie.  With that framework the fun begins.Kevin Spacey is a salesman in a  company like most that is going through the gauntlet of re-organization.  He is asked by a corporate hired &quot;efficiency expert&quot; to write his  own job description.  Many of us in corporate America know this is a  two-edged sword.  Make it good enough and you will eliminate a co-worker.  Make it not good enough and eliminate yourself.  Of course the efficiency  expert, is new to the company and has little respect for loyalty and past  successes.Kevin's screen wife is Annette Bening, she is a plastic  suburban real estate agent.  The world doesn't meet her standard's so she  left it long ago to become Martha Stewart.  Every now and then the cracks  show through and she does a wonderful scene demonstrating that.Their  daughter is the typical teenager, has everything, and hates the people that  provided it.  Especially her father, who walks on egg-shells at home, to  keep from bursting his plastic wife's bubble.Their neighbors are  perfect.  On one side we have the 90's gay couple trying to be the perfect  neighbors and fitting in with typical suburban life.  On the other side  the newcomers, they have a military type father, that is so anti-gay it is  a cartoon.  His son is apparently recently returned from a drug  rehab-psych. ward.  The military guy's wife looks like she is treading a  thin line between father and son.  Ironically, the son is the saner of the  three of them.With all this in mind Kevin Spacey coping with potential  job cuts, his wife dealing with a highly competitive California real estate  market and the daughter going through the trauma of a teenager, you have a  situation ripe for one of them to blow.Pretty much they all do.Kevin  Spacey meets the new neighbors, the neighbors meet each other.  Remember  the anti-gay military guy and the suburban gay couple.  You can figure the  rest.Through several incidents, Annette Benings real-estate party, going  to the daughters game at school, a rough real estate showing things start  to twist around.Kevin Spacey is inspired to hand in the job  description that we would love to give to the &quot;efficiency&quot;  expert, but ties it up with a golden parachute that allows him to pursue  other interests.  He also decides he is entirely smitten with his  daughter's vapid best friend.  (It is amazing some of the comments this  best friend makes.) His wife in &quot;awe-inspired&quot; bliss and over  frustration of her husband's new attitude takes off on a new venture  herself.

67437,A1XNXHTPQRACRO,0783239408,Barry C. Chow,"[46, 86]","What drives me nuts about this piece of snot--what gets my blood really boiling--is the way it deconstructs what are essentially Hollywood sins and then has the brazen gall to attribute them to suburbia. It's the Champagne set snickering at the yokels with slick condescension: ""We also may lust after young flesh, pursue gross materialism and sell out to superficiality, but we are among the chosen elite and do it with so much more style that we are entitled to our vapidity.""I dare Hollywood to show me a better example of what it is that this flick purports to deplore than the behaviour of their own mewling overpaid oversexed self-worshipping stars. ""Hypocrisy"" doesn't cover it; the word ""atrocity"" comes close. Out-of-control mid-life crisis? Hollywood. Nubile young goddesses with trash mouths? Hollywood. Arrested adolescence? Hollywood. Manic materialism? Hollywood. Self-absorption? Hollywood. It beggars belief how many thinking people have been hoodwinked into going along with this perversion of reality.This flick stands as a shining example of everything that is wrong with modern cinema. It is sanctimonious, stereotypical, pretentious, derivative, trivial, dishonest and phoney. Ohhh, let me count the ways:Sanctimony--Annette Benning plays Carolyn Burnham, a grotesque parody of a domestic diva. She is a Stepford Wife run amok: so driven by appearances that she sells her soul to bourgeois hell. This flick wants to tell us that it is doing us a favour shoving its distorted mirror in our face. What a vile insult.Stereotyping--A poor misunderstood dork has a father: who doesn't understand him; who is a sadist; who is a neo-nazi; who is a homophobe; who is a closet GAY sadistic neo-nazi homophobe; who is--gasp--a marine colonel. Why not also show him making blood sacrifices on a pentacle by the moonlight?Pretension--""Beauty is not to be found in the perfect curves of a teenage goddess. Turn and look where you least expect to find it. See the plastic bag floating in the breeze?"" In the context of a better movie, this might have amounted to something. Here, this film's tin-sentiment paper-thin superficiality just underscores the imagery's wretchedness.Derivation--From ""Man in the Grey Flannel Suit"" to ""Pleasantville"" to ""Edward Scissorhands"", the supposed emotional bankruptcy of suburbia has been picked to complete and utter death. As targets go, it would be more challenging to hit the broadside of a barn.Triviality--A man does not have the maturity to find the answers to the big questions in life by looking within himself. Instead, he blackmails his employer, lusts after a cheerleader, gets a McJob, gets high, gets a muscle car and gets dead. We are given to understand that this is terribly profound.Dishonesty--The catering budget alone for this pestilent excretion exceeded what any suburbanite could hope to spend on a lifetime of redecorating, self-absorption and mid-life splurges. I wonder how much Kevin Spacey got paid. Hypocrisy, thy name is Hollywood.Phoniness--Why do we need the fiction of an advertising man regressing to adolescence when we can see the real thing shining before us modeled by such luminaries as Jack Nicholson, Madonna and Cher? Muscle cars are, like, so pass&eacute;. Travolta pacified his mid-life crisis with a private jet.There are innumerable examples of good films that challenge us to re-examine our lives. But they do so with grace, with wisdom, and most of all, with humility--none of the smarmy, superior, condescending sanctimony that pervades this flick. Had this obscenity been set in Beverly Hills, with Kevin Spacey playing a director, Annette Benning an actress, Thora Birch their Hollywood brat, and Mena Suvari a rapacious starlet, it would have still stunk out the place. But it would have had the single grace of at least aiming for the right targets.",1,Profound? Beautiful?? Honest???

Hence, the movie's catch phrase - ""Look closer"".  Obviously, some people can't seem to look any closer than what they immediate see at the surface, so they don't understand.  And not understand is the start of belligerence and negativity.  The thing that was innovative about this was the positive message it was trying to send to everyone who watched it, ""Do what makes you happy.  There is always enough time left in your life.  There is always a chance.""  Kevin Spacey quit his job, in which he was a silent tool used for years, and he did it in a way where he still had a year's worth of pay.  It's realistic that he didn't immediately run out of money.  And to whomever thinks the point of this movie was to say something along the lines of ""Teens are deep.  Adults are shallow"" was severely mistaken.  The movie was about realization.  The realization that life is beautiful and that life is such a gift, so why waste it on trivial [stuff]?  Do what you feel, whatever makes you happy.  LOOK CLOSER.  I see know why they adopted that catch phrase for the movie, BECAUSE SOME PEOPLE DON'T KNOW HOW TO LOOK CLOSER.  So they miss the message of the movie and completely [ruined] it.  It's just so sad.  People miss the message.

It centers around the superficial outward appearance of beauty and success radiated by an American family of three and the sharply contrasting reality of its inner workings.  An impression left for the viewer's imagination includes the idea that the family once was beautiful and successful, but that the mental state of all three has declined through boredom and other factors to its present dismal state.  The father is Lester (Kevin Spacey) who seems to have lost his moral compass and has adopted the philosophy that nothing really matters.  His wife Carolyn projects the image of being in control of her life, but realizes the warmth in her marriage is gone and she's becoming desperate for meaning.  The daughter is Jane (Thora Birch) whose self esteem is disappearing and believes she's unattractive.  Jane falls in love with neighbor Ricky  (Wes Bently) who sells drugs and wants a career in the movie industry.  Ricky is regularly beaten to a pulp by his super-macho ex-marine father Colonel Fitts (Chris Cooper).  Lester falls in love with one of Jane's high school girlfriends, tries to seduce her in his own home and approaches the ultimate success when she panics and triggers a joint freeze-out.  Rick gets sick of his regular beatings and leaves home, taking Jane with him.  Lester is numb from his own experiences when neighbor Colonel Fitts has a meltdown and wanders over to Lester begging for tenderness, hugging and possibly a more intimate relationship.  The movie is loaded with light and dark humor along with significant bursts of total degradation.  Viewers who love dark humor will adore this movie.

Although, it is undeniable that Kevin Spacey and Annette Bening are wonderful in their roles, and that the camera work is quite impressive.  However, these are the few elements in the film that actually do impress.The amount of mindless cliches inherent to these characters is appalling.  American Beauty never fails to present people through the looking glass of trendy, political correctness.  Nowhere is this more true than with the gay couple, Jim and Jim.  They are the only normal adults in the movie.  By depicting them as a picture of stability, normality, and kindness, it is apparent, amidst the dysfunctionality everywhere else, that the creators are more concerned with trying to make a positive statement about homosexuality than present a meaningful film.  If all gay men formed the strong bonds these two possess, then there would never be any stigma to homosexuality in the first place.  The fact is that only within the gay male population do you find, when polled, anyone who's ever had 10,000 or more lifetime sexual partners.  Of course such a level of promiscuity is not the norm, but the majority do not live in mansions out in the suburbs with tax attorneys. What we see here, unfortunately, is pure spin.Even worse, and completely inexcusable, is the rendering of the Marine Colonel, Mr. Fitts.  Unlike the role model gay couple who, despite being a statistical abnormality, are actually representative of some gay Americans, I'm willing to bet that the Colonel is like no military man on this earth.  Certainly, he is nothing like any that I have met in my 35 years.  Fitts is an utter fiction produced by the mind of someone who hates this nation and our armed forces.The Colonel's method of leading his family is to beat him son and force him to take semi-annual drug tests.  His wife is even less a real person than he is.  She's a refugee from Valley of the Dolls and has been demoralized to the point of appearing a zombie.  From the moment we encounter Fitts, his accent and style of speech should alert anyone familiar with Hollywood's methods that he will be an example of intolerance.  Whenever one hears rural inflections on the big screen, one must realize that the individual will be endlessly derided by the tofu mandarins who intolerantly judge the rest of us from their perches on the left coast.  After all, in the moviemaker's configuration, only sadistic, close-minded, evil men would ever volunteer to defend the United States in the first place.That they could actually try to pass off this World War I drill master as a Colonel, let alone an actual human being, speaks volumes of how little they know about the armed forces and the disdain they have for the brave individuals who guard us while we sleep.  One cannot avoid having the impression that the director and screenwriter had never previously even met a member of the Marine Corps.The Colonel comes straight (sic) out of the GLSEN handbook for homophobia.  He is a caricature, the type of person ""whose hate will not save him.""  We discover, just as the politically correct manuals would predict, that he himself is secretly gay.  Well, of course he is, isn't everyone who disagrees with gay activists?  His existence is meant to dupe us into thinking that homophobia is not really a hysterical fabrication even though the character they choose to convey this is unquestionably a fabrication.  He is a creation stemming from heterophobia and paranoia in regards to masculinity.  The Colonel would rather kill his own son than allow him be gay which should alert every viewer that the film is utter propaganda  The last thing American Beauty wants to do is say something important about human nature.Just for the record, homosexuality is not something an officer in the Marine Corps would find very earthshaking.  How could he given that the Colonel was immersed in a male only culture for the majority of his professional career?  Fitts probably had to first deal with it a month after his enlistment began.  I bet he would have gotten over its uniqueness by the end of basic training.  We will soon have more opportunities to judge this director's opinions as he has just finished making the film ""Jarhead.""  I have no doubt that in it he  will more fully manufacture negative imagery regarding the world's most selfless soldiers.This horrendous portrait of suburbia never fails to disappoint.  A world that is steeped with narcissism, materialism, and constant sex is definitely an accurate snapshot of the mandarins dwelling in Hollywood, but it has no correlation with the great number of Americans who choose to live outside our major metropolises.",2,Zero Beauty.,1119657600,"06 25, 2005",2005,4799,"['must', 'have', 'been', 'ESP', 'kept', 'seeing', 'movie', 'so', 'many', 'years',

Taking what seems to be a drab storyline, the pace and the  approach surprise the audience; we are always with the characters when they  complain about their lives, and we are always with them when they laugh and  smile about their past experiences.  The actors are across-the-cast superb,  especially Kevin Spacey, who makes it seem impossible that Lester Burnham  be played by anyone but him.  While I personally did think that  &quot;American Beauty&quot; was a little overrated (I still haven't figured  out whether it really IS the best of the decade), and it's true that the  Colonel 's role seems only to propel the last act of the movie, that  doesn't change its magic.

He has it all; a lovely wife (Annette Benning), a cheerleader daughter(Thora Birch), a job for a major corproration, and a large house. But the film asks us to ""look closer"" and it does just that. We can clearly see that his life, marriage, and relationships are crumbling. He is going through a midlife crisis, wondering what he has done with his life to make it worthwhile. He quits his job and tries to seduce his daughter's best friend (Mena Suvari). The movie desplays not only his struggle, but the struggle of all the supporting character to see the beauty in life.The acting is certainly a standout. Spacey leads a cast that all inhabit their roles to surprising lengths. Each line is said to seeming perfection, and comes across and understandable and believeable.It is the directoral debut for Sam Mendes, who does an astonishingly great job. Each shot seems to have a purpose, and it if facinating to watch their lives intertwine.The screenplay is what makes the film a classic, though. The diolauge is fresh and crisp, while at the same time believeable. It is also incredibly funny and satirical, despite a strong subject matter (a lot of people find it odd that I laughed at a movie about a pedophile).Overall, American Beauty is an example of what happens when everything in a movie is done to perfection.

In 1999, that film was American Beauty.  It is contains lots of morally charged themes and tangents, but not really that much to say.The story itself starts out in the narrative-from-beyond-the-grave style like Sunset Boulevard, in which Lester (played masterfully by Kevin Spacey) describes his shallow and hopeless existence.  He is stuck in a dead-end job that he hates, his wife is an endlessly perky on the surface (but a vicious gold digger/adulteress beneath) suburban professional mom, his daughter is a sullen loner and he can only find solace from these suburban ills in masturbation.Lester decides that he is ""mad as hell and not going to take it anymore"" and rebels against his shallow and oppresive suburban existence by: quitting his job and blackmailing his boss into giving him a year's pay, smoking pot, lusting after a girl more than half his age (and working out to impress her), buying a fast car without consulting the wife, and taking a fast food job (because it requires the least amount of responsibility).  In other words, he escapes a shallow and oppressive suburban adult existence by reverting to a shallow suburban adolesence.If the quandry that Lester is in doesn't look all that oppresive to people, the writers ratchet up the oppresive quotient by introducing the Marine Corps neighbor: Colonel Fitts.  Fitts is a caricature straight from Hollywood's neurotic suburbia playbook.  (...)  Col. Fitts, along with Lester's wife, are the least satisfying and most stereotypical in the picture.Out of the entire cast Jane (Thora Birch) seems to be the only one who recognizes the symptoms and the correct cure.  She knows that she desperately needs structure in her life and won't find it from her father or her mother (and most likely not her ""beauty"" obssessed boyfriend).Among the muck described above, there are a few bright spots in the film.  Kevin Spacey is frankly riveting as Lester.  Even though the character is essentially a riff on the character he played in The Ref, he still acts with such verve as to truly deserve the academy award that he won for this role.  In fact, I think its primarily because of Spacey's greatness in this role that so many people have given the entire film such effusive praise.  The cinematography and the score are both excellent as well.In conclusion, while I found some of the film to be excellent and beyond compare of most cinematic releases; taken as a whole, I found it to be less-than-satisfying.",3,"looked closer, not much to see...",1070496000,"12 4, 2003",2003,2640,"['Nearly', 'year', 'one', 'film', 'lot', 'good', 'qualities', 'critics', 'seem', 'over-praise', 'over-hype', 'level', 'Citizen', 'Kane', 'Casablanca', '1999', 'film', 'was', 'American', 'Beauty', 'contains', 'lots', 'morally', 'charged', 'themes', 'tangents', 'not', 'really', 'that', 'much', 'say.The', 'story', 'out', 'narrative-from-beyond-the-grave', 'style', 'Sunset', 'Boulevard', 'Lester', 'played', 'masterfully', 'Kevin', 'Spacey', 'shallow', 'hopeless', 'existence', 'stuck', 'dead-end', 'job', 'wife', 'endlessly', 'perky', 'surface', 'vicious', 'gold', 'digger/adulteress', 'beneath', 'suburban', 'professional', 'mom', 'daughter', 'sullen', 'loner', 'can', 'only', 'find', 'solace', 'suburban', 'ills', 'masturbation.Lester', 'decides', 'mad', 'hell', 'not', 'going', 'take', 'anymore', 'rebels', 'shallow', 'oppresive', 'suburban', 'existence', 'quitting', 'job', 'blackmailing', 'boss', 'giving', 'year', 'pay', 'smoking', 'pot', 'lusting', 'girl', 'more', 'age', 'working', 'out', 'impress', 'buying', 'fast', 'car', 'consulting', 'wife', 'taking', 'fast', 'food', 'job', 'least', 'amount', 'responsibility', 'other', 'words', 'shallow', 'oppressive', 'suburban', 'adult', 'existence', 'reverting', 'shallow', 'suburban', 'quandry', 'Lester', ""n't"", 'look', 'oppresive', 'people', 'writers', 'ratchet', 'up', 'oppresive', 'quotient', 'introducing', 'Marine', 'Corps', 'neighbor', 'Colonel', 'Fitts', 'Fitts', 'caricature', 'straight', 'Hollywood', 'neurotic', 'suburbia', 'playbook', 'Col.', 'Fitts', 'Lester', 'wife', 'are', 'least', 'satisfying', 'most', 'stereotypical', 'picture.Out', 'entire', 'cast', 'Jane', 'Thora', 'Birch', 'be', 'only', 'one', 'who', 'symptoms', 'correct', 'cure', 'desperately', 'structure', 'life', 'wo', ""n't"", 'find', 'father', 'mother', 'most', 'likely', 'not', 'beauty', 'obssessed', 'boyfriend', 'muck', 'described', 'are', 'few', 'bright', 'spots', 'film', 'Kevin', 'Spacey', 'frankly', 'riveting', 'Lester', 'Even', 'character', 'essentially', 'riff', 'character', 'played', 'Ref', 'still', 'such', 'verve', 'truly', 'deserve', 'academy', 'award', 'won', 'role', 'fact', 'think', 'primarily', 'Spacey', 'greatness', 'role', 'so', 'many', 'people', 'have', 'given', 'entire', 'film', 'such', 'effusive', 'praise', 'cinematography', 'score', 'are', 'excellent', 'well.In', 'conclusion', 'found', 'film', 'be', 'excellent', 'compare', 'most', 'cinematic', 'releases', 'taken', 'whole', 'found', 'be', 'less-than-satisfying']",Belleza Americana American Beauty  VHS

I had no idea what I was getting into. All I knew is that the actor who had gotten my attention in such great movies as &quot;The Negotiator&quot; and &quot;The Usual Suspects&quot; was in the starring role, and that little kid from &quot;Now and Then&quot; had grown up and was showing off her chest. That was all I knew, all I expected. What I got was something much more than I would've ever expected from any movie: I got a masterpiece of such caliber that it quickly became one of my all-time favorite movies, ranking right alongside &quot;E.T.&quot; and &quot;Army of Darkness.&quot; The movie was like a vacuum that sucked me in from the first frame I laid my eyes on. I laughed my butt off, I was saddened, and I came out of the movie having a completely different perspective on how to live life, because that is what this film is really about: Life. Not so much how to live as how not to live it. We aren't advised to smoke marijuana or develop a crush on our teenage daughter's best friend when we're 42, we aren't advised to have an affair with the local real estate king, we aren't encouraged to film things that are none of our business through our upstairs window, and we aren't encouraged to like or despise homosexuality. We are encouraged, on the other hand, to live life for exactly what it is, not to fake who we are, and to not get so wrapped up in the idea of our own personal success that all other priorities including self and family become less than secondary.Carolyn: Lester, you're gonna spill beer on the couch. Lester: (Stands up, annoyed) So what? It's just a couch! Carolyn: This is a $4000 sofa upholstered in Italian Silk! This is NOT just a couch! Lester: (Picks up a sofa cushion and repeatedly slams it down on the couch in rhythm with his speech) IT'S... JUST... A... COUCH! (Lets go of cushion) This isn't life! (Softer) This is just stuff... and it's become more important to you than living. Well, honey, that's just nuts.The heart of &quot;American Beauty&quot; lies within that simple exchange of dialogue, and you can find evidence of that simple theme underlying every scene in the movie through the symbolism of roses. The many roses in &quot;American Beauty&quot; display a very simple message: Something isn't right. Something is being covered up. The world as we see it right now, while those roses are on the screen, is synthetic. Look for the roses in the movie. They're everywhere. The most obvious placement is the center of the dining table during the first dinner scene, and their absence in the second one, during one of the most kinetically hilarious arguments in cinema history.&quot;Video is a poor excuse, I know... but it helps me remember... I need to remember...&quot; ~Wes Bentley&quot;American Beauty&quot; is a movie to remember. We should all look at the real message of this extraordinary film as one to live by until the day we die. And we should also remember the remarkable performances from Kevin Spacey as Lester Burnham, the unhappy suburbanite confronting his midlife crisis; Annette Bening as Carolyn Burnham, the success-starved, sexually-frustrated real estate tycoon who begins an affair with Buddy Kane; and the three teenagers, Wes Bentley as the indomitable Ricky Fitts, Thora Birch as the insecure Jane Burnham, and Mena Suvari as the seemingly perfect example of American beauty, Angela Hayes. And the direction by Orson Welles look-alike Sam Mendes, screenplay by Alan Ball, and cinematography by veteran shooter Conrad L.

Director Sam Mendes and screenwriter Alan Ball, while both new to the screen, make it seem like they've been doing this for years. Titled a black comedy, American Beauty focuses on a middle-aged man going through a mid-life crisis in the middle of his boring life and tries to reinvent himself, so to speak, by setting his eyes on his daughter's best friend. Kevin Spacey, who plays Lester Burnham, is showcased in one of his best roles I have seen him in. Annette Bening, who plays his wife, Carolyn in the film, is also good, but not nearly as good as Spacey's character, who takes the stage throughout the film. Wes Bentley plays Ricky, a character who takes pleasure in Spacey's daughter in the film often by videotaping her. Thora Birch plays Jane, Spacey's daughter in the film with somewhat of a strong performance, as well as Mena Suvari who plays Angela, the girl that Lester lusts over in the film. Chris Cooper plays Colonel Frank Fitts, an ex-marine father who is rigid and harsh throughout.

67457,A3DDRVEBLLCAAW,0783239408,Brett Foster,"[3, 5]","First, I love American Beauty.  In recent years, The Matrix and Crouching Tiger are the only other films I've seen more than once while still in first-run theaters, and American Beauty has much more substance than either of those.  This movie is not an ""ugly look at life"" as some have said.  It is an extremely hopeful look at life.  Lester is a very real character that can be easily identified with, and everybody who feels that in some way their life has become a pathetic routine of dull existence can find assurance in the message that there's always time to make something of your life.  The opening narration very clearly states this as Kevin Spacey says:""Both my wife and daughter think I'm this gigantic loser, and they're right.  I have lost something.  I'm not exactly sure what it is, but I know I didn't always feel this... sedated.  But you know what?  It's never too late to get it back.""This movie is an inspiring message wrapped up in fun humor, great music, and beautiful cinematography.  The director states that it is a movie about imprisonment and escape from imprisonment.  I'm shocked at the number of people who just don't get it.  The people I know personally who don't like American Beauty aren't actually friends of mine, and they generally have that cranky, going-nowhere attitude about life.  (...) Does Lester&#8217;s mundane life hit a little too close to home?The closest thing to a legitimate criticism is that the movie glorifies a would-be pedophile.  People who say this need to pay more attention.  Lester is a middle-aged guy who isn't getting any at home, and Angela is constantly giving him eyes.  He even hears her shouting the obscene things she wants to do to him.  She claims to have had more sex as a teen than Lester has in his whole life.  Then Lester finds out his wife is ""getting nailed by the King of Real Estate.""  It&#8217;s understandable that his affection shifts from his wife to Angela.  Once Lester finds out the truth about Angela, we see a nice guy who wouldn't think of touching her.  Lester is a normal man who shows a moment of human weakness when a young girl is coming on strong.  If you think that makes him a pedophile, I'd hate to see your opinion of Kuberick's Lolita, where an even older man is very actively pursuing an even younger girl.  Just look at the facts.  Mena Suvari was 20 when the movie was made.  She plays a high-school girl who is old enough to drive, meaning her character is between the ages of 16 and 18.  16 is above the age of consent in 39 of 50 US states.  This film does not glorify a pedophile.(...) Yes, it is somewhat unpleasant seeing Lester get his brains blown out, but if they wanted gore, they would&#8217;ve shown the exit wound and made the blood darker, instead of making a bright puddle to match the red theme of the film.  Yes, the movie shows young girls&#8217; breasts, but I don&#8217;t see anybody accusing Traffic of being child pornography, and that has graphic depiction of a teenage girl whoring herself for drugs.  The beauty lies in the transformation of Lester.  I feel sorry for anybody who doesn&#8217;t fill with joy at the beginning of chapter 21.  I&#8217;m not a big fan of The Who, I don&#8217;t run marathons, and I don&#8217;t aspire to flip burgers, but when the film cuts to Lester running down the middle of the street to &#8220;The Seeker,&#8221; it makes me glad to be alive.Anyway, the DVD itself is a real disappointment.  Look at the name of the DVD.  ""The Awards Edition.""  It should've been called the (...) Edition.  This DVD was specifically made so that fans would end up purchasing the DVD twice when the REAL version is released.OK, maybe it's not that bad...  It DOES have both DTS and Dolby 5.1 audio, and it is one of the few DVD's that doesn't make you sit through a minute of obnoxious ""don't copy this"" warnings.  It DOES have two trailers, audio commentary, a featurette which just says, ""This movie is great!"", and a ""storyboard presentation.""So let me tell you what the problems are.  Just try to watch the hour-long storyboard special feature.  Particularly annoying is that it is one single 61-minute chapter.  It's really just a 49-image slideshow being discussed by the director and cinematographer.  The first 22 minutes of the presentation are spent discussing chapter 1-4 of the DVD.  The rest of the presentation skips around discussing chapter 5-18 of the DVD, and it ends abruptly without touching on the last 10 chapters.The most important flaw is heard when listening to the director commentary.(...)If you listen to the commentary, it's obvious that a ""deleted scenes"" section has already been compiled and prepared for the DVD, but they chose not to include it with ""The Awards Edition.""  Nobody in their right mind would say, ""I think people would rather see this horrible and incomplete storyboard discussion instead of the deleted scenes.""  It is clear that Dreamworks just wants to force the true fans to buy the DVD twice to get the version with the deleted scenes.  Expect to see &#8220;American Beauty: Special Edition&#8221; in a year or two.",2,"Wonderful movie, Horrible DVD",1006646400,"11 25, 2001",2001,5116,"['First', 'love', 'American', 'Beauty', 'recent',

67459,AE23DYT0RDFUV,0783239408,Brian Ridgway,"[13, 34]","Well, that may not be entirely accurate. I shouldn't say that this movie was a HUGE disappointment, simply because I went in with no expectations. And am I qualified to fully review?--since I was so bored with this film  that I walked out of the screening room after an hour? Maybe not. But I  will say this: AM has been called a sharp black comedy, commenting on  current American values. I didn't find the film particularly funny or  insightful (sorry folks--'King of Comedy' and 'Little Murders' w/Elliot  Gould still have more to say about American 'values' than this picture); I  didn't find the story particularly compelling (it reads more like a quiet,  suburban soap opera); and the performances didn't quite jell (the actors  all performed as if in different films, seperate from each other). To their  credit, Spacey (far better in t.v.'s WISEGUY) turned in a rather staid  performance, but this role was low on energy and believability. And I'm a  huge fan of Benning, but I will say that she gives it her all in a film  that is neither creatively photographed nor emotionally gripping, and  certainly doesn't do her any favors career-wise. All in all, it's a pretty  toothless effort from a group that should have been able to produce  something more.And finally, I can say this: even an episode of FOX's  comedy series 'TITUS' is sharper and more scathing than this weak effort.  Personally, I find it a bit insulting that a British director seems to  think this script qualified as any sort of legitimate contemporary  commentary, especially for someone working inside the 'Hollywood system.'  But I suppose that being a director for the major studios certainly  qualifies him as a keen observer of Midwestern values and the human  condition. Is it any wonder the Bristish no longer have a legitimate film  community?

67460,A14LIZKKA7WYT9,0783239408,brigsbmc@cs.com,"[0, 3]","AMERICAN BEAUTY was awarded the Oscar for Best picture last year, and with due cause.  It is an incredible movie about the disintegration of a marriage,  and some have gone so far to say that it is a study of the disintegration of the American family.  The directorial debut of Sam Mendes(Broadway's Cabaret Director) is one that will be remembered for years to come.  Alan Ball wrote the original screenplay,  winning an Oscar for his efforts,  as well as an Oscar for Mendes.  The story focuses on Lester and Carolyn Burnham.  While their daughter seems to hate both of them,  it seems as though they begin to hate each other,  although Lester attempts reconciliation to no avail.  Lester(Kevin Spacey) becomes infatuated with his daughter Jane's(Thora Birch)friend,  Angela(Mena Suvari).  Meanwhile,  Carolyn(Annette Bening) begins having an affair with a fellow real estate agent Buddy Kane(Peter Gallagher).  Jane falls in love with the next door neighbor Ricky(Wes Bentley) who is under strict watch by his ex-colonel father Frank(Chris Cooper).  This movie takes ordinary people and creates a chain reaction,  changing their lives forever.  Mendes has directed this film with incredible skill and panache,  and Ball's script is brilliant.  The real story here is the ensemble,  which won Best Ensemble award at the Screen Actors Guild Awards .  Kevin Spacey is simply incredible as Lester,  winning his second Oscar and first in the lead actor category(He recently won for The Usual Suspects as supporting actor).  Annette Bening gives the performance of a life-time as Carolyn, bringing new meaning to the word lead actress. Thora Birch is great as Jane,  the perfect image of a confused teen.  Mena Suvari is able to give a good deal of depth to a stereotypically unlikeable character.  Bravo! Chris Cooper is an excellent character actor,  making Frank Fitts an unforgettable character.  One of the most surprisingly brilliant and hardest characters was played with perfection by Wes Bentley.  Peter Gallagher is suave as Buddy,  and Allison Janney gives one of the strangest yet most powerful roles as Ricky's mother.

67461,AY69ZK7G6CNYJ,0783239408,"Britt Gillette ""thedvdreport.blogspot.com""","[4, 6]","Nominated for eight Academy Awards, and winner of five including Best Picture, American Beauty is one of the best films of all time. Exploring the depths of the American Dream - a good job, a nice house, the perfect marriage, etc. - the film is dripping with symbolism and satire. A cinematic study of societal dysfunction, American Beauty will affect a broad range of emotions within its viewing audience, and it'll make you laugh as well. This is a great movie, and although some people will shy away from it, everyone should see American Beauty at least once so they can form their own opinion...Kevin Spacey plays the role of Lester Burnham, a middle-aged suburban resident who seemingly lives the American Dream. He and his wife Carolyn (Annette Bening) have a nice house, a beautiful daughter Jane (Thora Birch), and successful careers. But things aren't always as they seem. In reality, the Burnham's are the definition of dysfunctional. They fight over everything, screaming at the dinner table about ridiculous things such as vegetables. Carolyn is engaged in an affair with rival real estate broker Buddy Kane (Peter Gallagher), and Lester is suffering from a creeping depression/mid-life crisis.Meanwhile, Jane is developing an infatuation with the strange boy who recently moved in next door, Ricky Fitts (Wes Bentley) - a drug dealer/homespun director with a homophobic Marine Corps father, Frank. When the source of Frank's homophobia bubbles to the surface, we learn that - just like the Burnham's - most of the neighborhood is living a different life from that which shows on the outside...Kevin Spacey follows up his amazing performances in The Usual Suspects and L.A. Confidential with his Academy Award for Best Actor in this film. Some of the funniest scenes in American Beauty involve the depressed Lester Burnham and his mid-life crisis meltdown. The way in which Spacey walks out of his job is utterly hilarious, and his weed-smoking, weight-lifting regimen in an effort to get pumped up and impress his daughter's friend is classic. But Spacey's performance is not alone. His brilliant role is complimented by Annette Bening's Oscar-caliber transformation into Lester's bitchy, cut-throat real-estate broker wife, Carolyn Burnham. Together, the two can stage an onscreen fight like no other fake married couple in cinema history, and it's a true pleasure to watch.American Beauty is further strengthened by Chris Cooper's role as the Burnham's homophobic neighbor (October Sky, The Patriot, Seabiscuit) and Mena Suvari's role as the big-talking school girl Angela Hayes, object of Lester's desires (Kiss The Girls, American Pie). American Beauty is a film bursting with stage talent, one that benefits from solid direction, a well-designed screenplay, and superb dialogue. Odds are, you'll either love it or hate it. But irrespective of your final take, American Beauty will invoke passion one way or the other. That's why this film ranks as a definite must-see...The DVD Report",5,One of the top films of the 1990s...,1113868800,"04 19, 2005",2005,3002,"['Nominated', 'eight', 'Academy', 'Awards', 'winner', 'five', 'including', 'Best', 'Picture', 'American', 'Beauty', 'one', 'best', 'films', 'time', 'Exploring', 'depths', 'American', 'Dream', 'good', 'job', 'nice', 'house', 'perfect', 'marriage', 'etc', 'film', 'dripping', 'symbolism', 'satire', 'A', 'cinematic', 'study', 'societal', 'dysfunction', 'American', 'Beauty', 'will', 'affect', 'broad', 'range', 'emotions', 'viewing', 'audience', ""'ll"", 'make', 'as', 'well', 'great', 'movie', 'people', 'will', 'shy', 'away', 'everyone', 'should', 'see', 'American', 'Beauty', 'least', 'once', 'can', 'form', 'own', 'opinion', 'Kevin', 'Spacey', 'role', 'Lester', 'Burnham', 'middle-aged', 'suburban', 'resident', 'who', 'seemingly', 'American', 'Dream', 'wife', 'Carolyn', 'Annette', 'Bening', 'have', 'nice', 'house', 'beautiful', 'daughter', 'Jane', 'Thora', 'Birch', 'successful', 'careers', 'things', 'are', ""n't"", 'always', 'seem', 'reality', 'Burnham', 'are', 'definition', 'dysfunctional', 'fight', 'everything', 'screaming', 'dinner', 'table', 'ridiculous', 'things', 'such', 'vegetables', 'Carolyn', 'engaged', 'affair', 'rival', 'real', 'estate', 'broker', 'Buddy', 'Kane', 'Peter', 'Gallagher', 'Lester', 'suffering', 'creeping', 'depression/mid-life', 'crisis.Meanwhile', 'Jane', 'developing', 'infatuation', 'strange', 'boy', 'who', 'recently', 'moved', 'next', 'door', 'Ricky', 'Fitts', 'Wes', 'Bentley', 'drug', 'dealer/homespun', 'director', 'homophobic', 'Marine', 'Corps', 'father', 'Frank', 'When', 'source', 'Frank', 'homophobia', 'surface', 'learn', 'just', 'Burnham', 'most', 'neighborhood', 'living', 'different', 'life', 'outside', 'Kevin', 'Spacey', 'up', 'amazing', 'performances', 'Usual', 'Suspects', 'L.A', 'Confidential', 'Academy', 'Award', 'Best', 'Actor', 'film', 'funniest', 'scenes', 'American', 'Beauty', 'involve', 'depressed', 'Lester', 'Burnham', 'mid-life', 'crisis', 'meltdown', 'way', 'Spacey', 'job', 'utterly', 'hilarious', 'weed-smoking', 'weight-lifting', 'regimen', 'effort', 'get', 'pumped', 'up', 'impress', 'daughter', 'friend', 'classic', 'Spacey', 'performance', 'not', 'alone', 'brilliant', 'role', 'complimented', 'Annette', 'Bening', 'Oscar-caliber', 'transformation', 'Lester', 'bitchy', 'cut-throat', 'real-estate', 'broker', 'wife', 'Carolyn', 'Burnham', 'Together', 'two', 'can', 'stage', 'onscreen', 'fight', 'other', 'fake', 'married', 'couple', 'cinema', 'history', 'true', 'pleasure', 'watch.American', 'Beauty', 'further', 'strengthened', 'Chris', 'Cooper', 'role', 'Burnham', 'homophobic', 'neighbor', 'October', 'Sky', 'Patriot', 'Seabiscuit', 'Mena', 'Suvari', 'role', 'big-talking', 'school', 'girl', 'Angela', 'Hayes', 'object', 'Lester', 'desires', 'Kiss', 'Girls', 'American', 'Pie', 'American', 'Beauty', 'film', 'bursting', 'stage', 'talent', 'one', 'benefits', 'solid', 'direction', 'well-designed', 'screenplay', 'superb', 'dialogue', 'Odds', 'are', ""'ll"", 'either', 'love', 'hate', 'irrespective', 'final', 'take', 'American', 'Beauty', 'will', 'invoke', 'passion', 'one', 'way', 'other', 'why', 'film', 'definite', 'must-see', 'DVD', 'Report']",Belleza Americana American Beauty  VHS

67465,A3HTX1NOTTWERP,0783239408,Busy Body,"[14, 19]","I first watched American Beauty a few nights ago after putting it off for years. I instantly wanted to see this film after it scooped all those Oscars back in 2000, but I never got around to doing so. To cut a long story short, I watched it the other night, after forgetting about it. My expectations, admittedly, were rather low. How wrong I was.Lester Burnham (Kevin Spacey) is your average, middle-aged family man. He works a $60,000 per annum job and lives as home with his wife Carolyn (Annette Bening) who is a straight-laced, worry wart who sells real estate and is obsessed with looking her best and being successful. They both have a daughter, Jane (Thora Birch) who is your typical rebellious teenage girl, unsatisfied with her figure, despises her parents and longs for someone who will love her. Living next door we have the 18-year-old Ricky Fitts (Wes Bentley) who lives with his father Marine Corps Colonel Frank Fitts and his rather catatonic wife. What we have appears to be two typical American families, living through the trials and tribulations of family life, and living the American dream.However, things are certainly not as they seem, and director Sam Mendes cleverly unravels this as the film progresses. Lester instantly falls for his daughter's best friend Angela Hayes (Mena Suvari) at a game. His marriage is currently in a rut, his wife hates him and they haven't made love in a long, long time. Her beauty transforms him, and some of the greatest moments of this movie are where he detaches from reality and slips into a fantasy world where it is just him and her together - the most famous being the nude rose petals scene. He is soon working out and building himself up to impress her. Jane is 'friends' with this vixen character Angela, but at times the latter's beauty depresses Jane, who is already insecure about her appearance. Angela can't understand why Ricky isn't interested in her, just because every other guy is. Ricky, however, is more interested in Jane. She hides it at first, but deep down, she's touched that someone is interested in her. What blossoms is a sweet and beautiful relationship, despite the insane parents they both have. Some of the film's best moments are the intimate connections of loneliness that these two angst-ridden teenagers share.Ricky's father is one of the most striking and memorable characters from the film, and all for the wrong reasons. He's a homophobic and straight-laced man who lives his life by rules. When he bursts into Ricky's room and beats him for entering his secret room, not only are we shocked by what is happening, but by Ricky's lack of resistance. Suddenly we realise why he spends so much time filming floating paper bags, dead birds and Jane - he believe in the hope of escapism from his horrific father (&quot;Yes Sir. Thank you Sir.&quot;). We also realise why Ricky's mother is slightly catatonic - she has obviously been beaten into submission by the evil man. This is the point in the film, in my opinion, in which the film's dark and violent side breaks through. American life is not as shiny and happy as it seems.Carolyn starts an affair with her real estate competition, and it's truly funny to see her try and act all sophisticated around Lester. She is so materialistic, it's unreal. It's more important to her than living, and it's a sad state of affairs when we witness this. The finale to the film is superb. By the end she's a self-help sad case and a gun-toting loony who realises everything she's lost. Lester takes more control of his life, dropping his $60,000 a year job to take up a job in a fast-food restaurant (I love his line, &quot;I'm looking for the least possible amount of responsibility!&quot;). He lets go of his whole life and responsibilities. He decides to look after himself and perfecting his goal on bedding Angela. By the end of the film he almost succeeds, until she confesses it's her first time. All the blabbing about the action she's been getting is all rubbish. Lester realises too late how immature he has been, and he can't go back and change it. The conclusion of Lester's final state comes from someone who cannot face up to who he is, because he lives by society's expectations. He can't face up to being something he is so against, and this serves as a stark reminder to us all.The whole film is superbly filmed and brilliantly acted. Kevin Spacey is superb, as is Annette Bening. Thora Birch is simply gorgeous as Jane, and her angst-ridden teenage role of rebellion is incredibly believable. Wes Bentley shines amazingly, and Mena Suvari is very convincing as that feisty vixen. This really is one of the best-assembled casts I have ever seen from a movie. Sam Mendes pulled off an amazing feat in directing this movie, and for once, the Academy got it right in making this Best Picture Of The Year. There are moments in this film that I can relate to more than any other film, and some moments make me want to cry because of the intense emotion on display.OVERALL GRADE: 10/10I watched this film with my mum the other day - she didn't like it much because of the swearing, but that's to be expected, but to dismiss it as a poor film as she did stunned me. This was by far one of the best movies I have ever seen, and a few obscenities isn't going to change that! The soundtrack to this film is equally stunning - the quiet music in these intimate moments is fantastic and completely draws you into the film with the characters. All in all, this is a must see movie for anyone who is a fan of social satires. A masterpiece of the biggest standards.",5,Even Red Roses Cannot Disguise The Truth...,1081296000,"04 7, 2004",2004,5602,"['first', 'watched', 'American', 'Beauty', 'few', 'nights', 'ago', 'putting',

I had seen the reviews and was unimpressed.  Ironically, it starred Kevin Spacey who is among my favorite actors working today.  The subject matter (at first glance) seemed contrived in it's satirical look at modern day suburbia.  It seemed prime for a Sunday 8pm time slot on the Lifetime channel and not the big screen.  After seeing &quot;Magnolia&quot; (which I hated) in December later that year, I was in no hurry to see &quot;American Beauty&quot;.  The two films seemed all too similar in tone and dramatic content.  I was glad that I finally gave in earlier this year and rented this fine work by first time film director Sam Mendes.  Unlike &quot;Magnolia&quot;, this film has a discernible purpose: to give the audience a voyeuristic view into the life of Lester Burnham (Spacey) and the supporting players and draw similarities to how we view our own lives. The rest of the cast is suberb (especially Wes Bentley who steals every scene).  &quot;American Beauty&quot; is a poignant and powerful film which I highly recommend.",5,Opposite of Magnolia,971827200,"10 18, 2000",2000,1168,"['When', 'movie', 'was', 'first', 'released', 'theatres', 'back', 'September', '1999', 'shyed', 'away', 'purchasing', 'ticket', 'box', 'office', 'had', 'seen', 'reviews', 'was', 'unimpressed', 'Ironically', 'starred', 'Kevin', 'Spacey', 'who', 'favorite', 'actors', 'working', 'today', 'subject', 'matter', 'first', 'glance', 'seemed', 'contrived', 'satirical', 'look', 'modern', 'day', 'suburbia', 'seemed', 'prime', 'Sunday', '8pm', 'time', 'slot', 'Lifetime', 'channel', 'not', 'big', 'screen', 'seeing', 'quot', 'Magnolia', 'quot', 'hated', 'December', 'later', 'year', 'was', 'hurry', 'see', 'quot', 'American', 'Beauty', 'quot', 'two', 'films', 'seemed', 'too', 'similar', 'tone', 'dramatic', 'content', 'was', 'glad', 'finally', 'gave', 'earlier', 'year', 'rented', 'fine', 'work', 'first', 'time', 'film', 'director', 'Sam', 'Mendes', 'Unlike', 'quot', 'Magnolia', 'quot', 'film', 'discernible', 'purpose', 'give', 'audience', 'voyeuristic', 'view', 'life', 'Lester', 'Burnham', 'Spacey', 'supporting', 'players', 'draw', 'similarities', 'how', 'view', 'own', 'lives', 'rest', 'cast', 'suberb', 'especially', 'Wes', 'Bentley', 'who', 'scene', 'quot', 'American', 'Beauty', 'quot', 'poignant', 'powerful', 'film', 'highly', 'recommend']",Belleza Americana American Beauty  VHS

67472,A17N23WXA7EAF,0783239408,"C. Colt ""It Just Doesn't Matter""","[0, 0]","&quot;American Beauty&quot; is one of the few great films to come out of Hollywood in recent times. It is a film of irony and contrast with a deeply revealing title. The film contrasts two different kinds of beauty: the material objects (money, home, sex partners) that we think are beautiful and the potential we have as human beings to enrich each other's lives. It is often our misconception of beauty that hinders our attainment of the real thing.Although the film takes place in suburban America and shows us the gnawing misery, and dissapointment that many of its denizens feel, it is not an assault on anyone's values or way of life. Instead, it is a study of the confusion and misdirection that most people feel and which drives them to inadvertantly hurt one another.Lester Burnham is angry at his wife because she appears to be an obsessive materialist to him. His wife despises him because he does not do the things that she believes are necessary to ensure the family's survival. Lester's daughter hates him because he lusts for her best friend. This is a bit of a gray area because on the one hand her resentment is based on sincere revulsion, and on the other hand it is based on a sense of loss of her fauther's attention in a psycho-sexual manner. Lester's neighbor appears to be a typical bigot, and homophobe, while the neighbor's eccentric son is the only person who seems to actually see what is going on in other peoples' lives. The son furtively films the Burnhams and in the process he gains insite into their disenchantment. He also falls in love with and has an affair with Lester's daughter.The film questions why we choose to lead the kind of lives we do and what our fixations--many of which are rooted in materialism--really amount to. Lester lusts for his daughter's friend, but in the end he redeems himself by caring for her in a compassionate manner rather than taking advantage of her. The biggoted neighbor on the other hand is unable to transcend his homophobic fixations which--no surprise here--are rooted in his own repressed homosexuality. One of the most tragic and sympathetic characters in the film is Lester's wife. In the process of struggling to look after her family in the best way she knows how (selling houses and keeping her own home spotless)she is left with a sense of yearning but no idea of what she is missing or how to obtain it.At the end of the film, moments before his death, Lester looks at a picture of his emotionally estranged wife and daughter and shakes his head in happy disbelief. Despite the problems, fights, and misunderstandings he realizes that they are the source of his happiness and and that they have many possibilites together. The evolution of Lester's sense of beauty--from lusting for a teenage girl to feeling genuine love for his family--is similar to Socrates'sense of beauty in &quot;The Symposium&quot;. The film does not give us a neat and tidy ending. Lester dies before he can act on his realization and it is unclear whether his wife and daughter will achieve the same understanding he did.&quot;American Beauty&quot; shows us that most of our unhappiness is illusary. We are afraid of things which may or may not exist and we are struggling to obtain things of marginal importance. In the process of disecting these things, the film also reveals our tremendous possibility for happiness. This possibility is surrounded by obstacles and is often invisible. It often comes on the tail end of many mistakes and only if we are open-minded or perceptive enough to grasp it. But it is very real and it is out there for all of us.

Spacey and Bening are a fairly loathsome couple, only sympathetic intermittently. The truly compelling aspect of the film resides in the family next door: father Chris Cooper, mother Allison Janney, and son Wes Bentley. What goes on in this household is the true stuff of moviemaking. Janney who has achieved much-deserved fame as a result of her role on The West Wing has been around quite a while, turning in flawless performances each time out of the gate. But what she does in American Beauty, with only a few lines of dialogue, is simply awe-inspiring. I came away from this film positively stricken by her performance which is a masterpiece of understated acting. The same is true of Chris Cooper (who is, at last, getting much-deserved recognition for his fine talent) in the role of a man trying to contain massive fears about his true identity. And Wes Bentley is terrific, dark and defiant, as the son of this household.If you take a step back and look closely at the Spacey character, what you see is perilously close to pedophelia--a man lusting after an underage girl. That it's covered in rose petals doesn't make it any more palatable. Yes there are some good scenes but it doesn't alter the core thesis that a middle-aged man, fed up with his awful family, makes drastic changes to his life because he is hopelessly drawn to a teenage girl.Watch this one for the Janney, Cooper, Bentley performances. They're worth the time.

His wife, Carolyn Burnham (Annette Bening) is an overahciever, work-aholic, real estate seller. And his teenage daughter, Jane Burnham (Thora Birch), is rebellious and conceited--or so we think. Lester is going through a mid-life crisis, and his life is going down the drain. First, he finds out that Carolyn is having an affair with her arch rival, the successful real estate seller, Buddy Kane (Pete Gallagher). Lester always used to do whatever Carolyn wanted, to avoid arguing or getting a divorce, but now he's starting to stick up for himself. He just met Jane's new high school friend, Angela Hayes (Mena Suvari), and he's fallen in love with her beauty. Jane is being stalked by the teenage boy next door who's family just moved to town, Ricky Fitts (Wes Bentley). Lester wants to get to know his daughter better, but she refuses to spend more time with him, after she finds out that he likes her best friend. Lester also quits his terrible job when they hire a new vice president, begins to exercise in hopes that he will be able to impress Angela, and even starts smoking pot with Ricky, who he's befriended, though he doesn't realize Ricky likes his daughter. Ricky's abusive, gay-hating father, Colonel Fitts (Chris Cooper), also has a dark secret...which you will learn when you watch the film.OVERALL THOUGHTS: ""American Beauty"" is a thought-provoking film. It's poignant and entertaining. Sam Mendes does an incredible directing job. The cinematography is stunning, and the music is haunting. The acting by the entire cast is absolutely superb--especially the performance given by Kevin Spacey. The storyline and script are amazing. There's a good twist to the ending, which makes it original and stands out from all the rest that are similar to it.The DVD extras are a nice finishing touch to the DVD. This DVD includes a making of the film featurette, exclusive storyboards, commentary, production notes, and theatrical trailers.I highly recommend ""American Beauty"".Score:100/100A+",5,Breathtaking film about an average American family.,1042761600,"01 17, 2003",2003,2249,"['American', 'Beauty', 'beautiful', 'original', 'American', 'film', 'directed', 'surprise', 'British', 'director', 'Sam', 'Mendes.PLOT', 'SUMMARY', 'Kevin', 'Spacey', 'Lester', 'Burnham', 'average', 'everyday', 'hard', 'working', 'father/husband', 'who', 'magazine', 'boring', 'job', 'wife', 'Carolyn', 'Burnham', 'Annette', 'Bening', 'overahciever', 'work-aholic', 'real', 'estate', 'seller', 'teenage', 'daughter', 'Jane', 'Burnham', 'Thora', 'Birch', 'rebellious', 'conceited', 'so', 'think', 'Lester', 'going', 'mid-life', 'crisis', 'life', 'going', 'down', 'drain', 'First', 'out', 'Carolyn', 'having', 'affair', 'arch', 'rival', 'successful', 'real', 'estate', 'seller', 'Buddy', 'Kane', 'Pete', 'Gallagher', 'Lester', 'always', 'used', 'do', 'Carolyn', 'wanted', 'avoid', 'arguing', 'getting', 'divorce', 'now', 'starting', 'stick', 'up', 'just', 'met', 'Jane', 'new', 'high', 'school', 'friend', 'Angela', 'Hayes', 'Mena', 'Suvari', 'fallen', 'love', 'beauty', 'Jane', 'being', 'stalked', 'teenage', 'boy', 'next', 'door', 'who', 'family', 'just', 'moved', 'town', 'Ricky', 'Fitts', 'Wes', 'Bentley', 'Lester', 'get', 'know', 'daughter', 'better', 'spend', 'more', 'time', 'out', 'best', 'friend', 'Lester', 'also', 'terrible', 'job', 'when', 'hire', 'new', 'vice', 'president', 'exercise', 'hopes', 'will', 'be', 'able', 'impress', 'Angela', 'even', 'smoking', 'pot', 'Ricky', 'who', 'befriended', ""n't"", 'realize', 'Ricky', 'daughter', 'Ricky', 'abusive', 'gay-hating', 'father', 'Colonel', 'Fitts', 'Chris', 'Cooper', 'also', 'dark', 'secret', 'will', 'learn', 'when', 'watch', 'film.OVERALL', 'THOUGHTS', 'American', 'Beauty', 'thought-provoking', 'film', 'poignant', 'entertaining', 'Sam', 'Mendes', 'incredible', 'directing', 'job', 'cinematography', 'stunning', 'music', 'haunting', 'acting', 'entire', 'cast', 'absolutely', 'superb', 'especially', 'performance', 'given', 'Kevin', 'Spacey', 'storyline', 'script', 'are', 'amazing', 'good', 'twist', 'ending', 'original', 'out', 'rest', 'are', 'similar', 'it.The', 'DVD', 'extras', 'are', 'nice', 'finishing', 'touch', 'DVD', 'DVD', 'making', 'film', 'featurette', 'exclusive', 'storyboards', 'commentary', 'production', 'notes', 'theatrical', 'trailers.I', 'highly', 'recommend', 'American', 'Beauty', '.Score:100/100A+']",Belleza Americana American Beauty  VHS

""cscotts""","[1, 5]","Hands down one of the most profound and strikingly original movies to be released in the last decade, AMERICAN BEAUTY gives the audiences a glimpse into the everyday life of your 'average' American family--suffice it to say, you're a LONG way from the Brady Bunch here.  Kevin Spacey justifies his Oscar win as the films male parental unit, Lester Burnham, basically a going nowhere fortysomething who's lost all interest in life, including the part that his marriage occupies.  Annette Bening gives her finest performance to date(and highly underrated) as his seemingly perky real estate agent wife Carolyn.  Bening gravitates between happy and pathetic, usually in the same scene, and does so with the slightest of ease.  Thora Birch, a long way from her days as a child actress, gives a sterling performance as Jane, Lester and Carolyn's daughter who is completely frustrated with the &quot;lameness&quot; with which her parents lead their life.  She's also appalled at the way with which her horny father gawks at her best friend Angela.  She's played by Mena Suvari, in possibly the film's most revelatory performance, as Suvari goes far deeper than most would into what makes this usually token jailbait character tick, and comes out with a completely fleshed out portrait of a very insecure young girl.  Also playing the gawking game,with better results, is Wes Bentley, who plays Rickey, the Burnham's cleverly sly drug dealer neighbor, and the pursuer of their daughter's affections.Rounding the acting ensemble is Chris Cooper, who plays Rickey's dad(and who has some very deep-rooted secrets) and Allison Janney, that rare actress who never fails to bring anything less than an indelible impression to even the smallest of roles, as Rickey's mother.  The story is utterly thought-provoking--this is that rare movie that lives so much better beyond the hype that surrounded it.

After a while the basic message of the film began to take shape for me and made a colossal difference.  So (without giving anything away), I believe this movie is about bravery.  Not the kind of &quot;I'll take the hill&quot; bravery we're used to, but everyday bravery, the kind that is too often found in short supply.  It's a story about a man who is almost a composite of what allot of men subconsciously strive for (not how he turns out, but the basic attributes of his life).  His world slowly and unnoticably degenerated into a life of misery.And he did something about it.He bravely decided to change.He doesn't follow the textbook, and so a good deal of drama ensues, but he does his best.  I found it admirable, brave, and, well, no pun intended, but I found it really beautiful.You're entitled to disagree with my interpretation, but when I shared it with a very intelligent friend of mine who didn't like the film, he instantly changed his opinion on it.I hope you enjoy half as much as I did.",5,I almost walked out of one of my favorite movies of all time,1082505600,"04 21, 2004",2004,1513,"['Just', 'quick', 'note', 'few', 'who', 'have', ""n't"", 'seen', 'movie', 'fewer', 'who', 'did', ""n't"", 'thoroughly', 'enjoy', 'it.This', 'movie', 'perfect', 'aesthetic', 'sense', 'music', 'brilliant', 'soundtrack', 'own', 'cinematography', 'world', 'class', 'talent', 'giving', 'best', 'performances', 'thier', 'lives', 'still', 'almost', 'walked', 'felt', 'Hollywood', 'had', 'crafted', 'perfect', 'movie', 'devoid', 'message', 'indulgent', 'almost', ""coulnd't"", 'stand', 'was', 'case.Thankfully', 'was', ""n't"", 'reason', 'review', 'basic', 'message', 'film', 'began', 'take', 'shape', 'made', 'colossal', 'difference', 'So', 'giving', 'anything', 'away', 'believe', 'movie', 'bravery', 'Not', 'kind', 'quot', ""'ll"", 'take', 'hill', 'quot', 'bravery', ""'re"", 'used', 'everyday', 'bravery', 'kind', 'too', 'often', 'found', 'short', 'supply', 'story', 'man', 'who', 'almost', 'composite', 'what', 'allot', 'men', 'subconsciously', 'strive', 'not', 'how', 'out', 'basic', 'attributes', 'life', 'world', 'slowly', 'unnoticably', 'degenerated', 'life', 'misery.And', 'did', 'something', 'it.He', 'bravely', 'decided', 'change.He', ""n't"", 'follow', 'textbook', 'so', 'good', 'deal', 'drama', 'ensues', 'best', 'found', 'admirable', 'brave', 'well', 'pun', 'intended', 'found', 'really', ""'re"", 'entitled', 'disagree', 'interpretation', 'when', 'shared', 'very', 'intelligent', 'friend', 'mine', 'who', 'did', ""n't"", 'film', 'instantly', 'changed', 'opinion', 'it.I', 'hope', 'enjoy', 'half', 'as', 'much', 'did']",Belleza Americana American Beauty  VHS

67495,A3H1PU959E7MXG,0783239408,"clarence a connelly, jr.","[0, 0]","The film ""American Beauty"" is great and a true example of the Black Comedy.  Kevin Spacey is awesome in the lead role and Annette Bening is his equal.  This movie rates as among the best work that either of them has ever done.  Kevin Spacey's character is a man who is disenchanted with every aspect of his life including his marriage and his job.  He is middle aged and decides toleave his job in advertising and takes a job in a fast food joint.  He also developes a serious crush on one of the girlfriends of his teenage daughter and really embarrasses his daughter by recklessly pursuing this girl.  She attempts to be worldly but it turns out that she is a virgin who pretends to have sexual experience.  In addition, the girl teases her friend about seducing the young lady's father. Meanwhile,  his daughter falls for the boy next door who is her age and is a voyeur who takes pictures of Spacey's daughter from his bedroom window.  When she realizes that she is being photographed, she decides to partially disrobe to excite the neighbor.  The young man also reintroduces the Spacey character to drugs.  Mostly marijuana.  The father of this boy is constantly spying on his son who in the past has done drugs.  The father makes the boy give a urine sample and also locks certain parts of the house to indicate that they are off limits to the boy.The Kevin Spacey character also begins a serious exercise regimen in order to assist him in enticing his daughter's friend.  One aspect of the exercise regimine is that Spacey begins to work out with some men who are openly gay and this allows the boy's father to speculate that Spacey's character is gay as well.Suffice it to say, the daughter and wife are seriously unhappy with him and the wife embarks on an affair with a fellow real estate salesman who is much more successful in the industry than she is.  The two adulterers are caught when they drive up to the fast food restaurant where Kevin Spacey character works.The film ends in a tragic way when the teenage boy's father believes that his son is in a homosexual relationship with Kevin Spacey.  The father beats the boy and orders him out of the home and the two teenagers plan to runaway to NYC together.  Kevin Spacey's character attempts to have sex with the friend of his daughter but upon finding out that she has no previous sexual experience, he loses his desire for her.Kevin Spacey's character is murdered.

67496,A1AISPOIIHTHXX,0783239408,"Cloud ""...""","[0, 2]","It was the little film that could: well-known stars, a small budget and a debut director that ended up being pretty successful, even garnering the big Oscar prize. Instead of being a long epic dramatic film, American Beauty, a small suburban based film with big problems ended up winning. And just like Shakespeare in Love or A Beautiful Mind, people will absolutely love it or some who just can't stand it. I have no idea where I fit in.Lester Burnham is an unhappy married father working for a magazine. Despite working for more than 10 years, he needs to prove he still can do a good job. At home, he's got a very pedantic suburban housewife and the pre-requisite lonely confused teenage daughter. Well, a girl changes his life and soon he starts being more uninhibited including quitting his job, buying a car and telling off people who annoy him. In the meantime, his wife is also changing her life and his daughter is pursuing a relationship with an odd kid next door.I'll be honest: I saw this once before and I have to admit, I hated the thing. It seemed like artsiness to the extreme and while it's not as strongly it's still there. Roses flying out of shirts, laying in a pool of them, getting some philosophical meaning out of a flying plastic bag it seems like self-knowing importance. While there's nothing wrong with it in a film, to put a whole bunch of clever and grandiose images to me cheapens it a bit.Where the film succeeds though is its performances, except personally two. Kevin Spacey is always reliable and Thora Birch is perfect as that confused grumpy teenager. The only 2 that don't fit are Annette Bening and Wes Bentley. The former seems to overdial her performance at times being very loud and little else while Wes just seems to stare a lot. Allison Janney seems kind of wasted, not terrible. She's just very underwritten and just...""there"".The film's tagline ""look closer"" is perfect for the film as that big helicopter opening shot makes it look picturesque Americana-like but further in there's a lot of problems. Boring go-nowhere jobs, too-happy spouses, whiny daughters and oddball neighbours are very much in style right now and the film shows them off at their worst.It's highly debatable whether American Beauty deserved its Best Picture. It was up against favorites Sixth Sense and Green Mile, 2 admittedly good films but little in the way of classic Best Picture status. So it was either the better film that year or a lack of options. I liked Sixth Sense more but this film's still as enjoyable.",4,It's at least worth a look,1142640000,"03 18, 2006",2006,2539,"['was', 'little', 'film', 'could', 'well-known', 'stars', 'small', 'budget', 'debut', 'director', 'ended', 'up', 'being', 'pretty', 'successful', 'even', 'garnering', 'big', 'Oscar', 'prize', 'Instead', 'being', 'long', 'epic', 'dramatic', 'film', 'American', 'Beauty', 'small', 'suburban', 'based', 'film', 'big', 'problems', 'ended', 'up', 'winning', 'just', 'Shakespeare', 'Love', 'A', 'Beautiful', 'Mind', 'people', 'will', 'absolutely', 'love', 'who', 'just', 'ca', ""n't"", 'stand', 'have', 'idea', 'where', 'fit', 'in.Lester', 'Burnham', 'unhappy', 'married', 'father', 'working', 'magazine', 'working', 'more', '10', 'years', 'prove', 'still', 'can', 'do', 'good', 'job', 'home', 'got', 'very', 'pedantic', 'suburban', 'housewife', 'pre-requisite', 'lonely', 'confused', 'teenage', 'daughter', 'Well', 'girl', 'life', 'soon', 'being', 'more', 'uninhibited', 'including', 'quitting', 'job', 'buying', 'car', 'telling', 'off', 'people', 'who', 'annoy', 'meantime', 'wife', 'also', 'changing', 'life', 'daughter', 'pursuing', 'relationship', 'odd', 'kid', 'next', 'door.I', ""'ll"", 'be', 'honest', 'saw', 'once', 'have', 'admit', 'hated', 'thing', 'seemed', 'like', 'artsiness', 'extreme', 'not', 'strongly', 'still', 'there', 'Roses', 'flying', 'shirts', 'laying', 'pool', 'getting', 'philosophical', 'meaning', 'flying', 'plastic', 'bag', 'self-knowing', 'importance', 'nothing', 'wrong', 'film', 'put', 'whole', 'bunch', 'clever', 'grandiose', 'images', 'bit.Where', 'film', 'performances', 'personally', 'two', 'Kevin', 'Spacey', 'always', 'reliable', 'Thora', 'Birch', 'perfect', 'confused', 'grumpy', 'teenager', 'only', '2', 'do', ""n't"", 'fit', 'are', 'Annette', 'Bening', 'Wes', 'Bentley', 'former', 'overdial', 'performance', 'times', 'being', 'very', 'loud', 'little', 'else', 'Wes', 'just', 'stare', 'lot', 'Allison', 'Janney', 'kind', 'wasted', 'not', 'terrible', 'just', 'very', 'underwritten', 'just', '.The', 'film', 'tagline', 'look', 'closer', 'perfect', 'film', 'big', 'helicopter', 'opening', 'shot', 'look', 'picturesque', 'Americana-like', 'further', 'lot', 'problems', 'Boring', 'go-nowhere', 'jobs', 'too-happy', 'spouses', 'whiny', 'daughters', 'oddball', 'neighbours', 'are', 'very', 'much', 'style', 'right', 'now', 'film', 'off', 'worst.It', 'highly', 'debatable', 'American', 'Beauty', 'deserved', 'Best', 'Picture', 'was', 'up', 'favorites', 'Sixth', 'Sense', 'Green', 'Mile', '2', 'admittedly', 'good', 'films', 'little', 'way', 'classic', 'Best', 'Picture', 'status', 'was', 'better', 'film', 'year', 'lack', 'options', 'liked', 'Sixth', 'Sense', 'more', 'film', 'still', 'enjoyable']",Belleza Americana American Beauty  VHS

Benning is glorious as the Martha Stewart-like, neglectful working mother who is more concerned about her prize roses than her misfiring family life. Spacey  exemplifies a belated return to youth, relishing even his boyhood burger  stand job as a counter-balance to the baloney-filled, useless telemarketing  position from which he bribed his way out. The kids find dashing rebuke for  the alientation of parents and society in their dreams of boiking men,  running away, and filming dead people.

Every year it seems, the media picks up on an &quot;intellectual&quot; movie to praise so they can seem intelligent. This  movie was the entry for 1999.  Kevin Spacey is entertaining as Lester and  the rest of the actors are fine, especially Thora Birch who plays the  harried daughter perfectly.Unfortunately, for me, the film seemed to  be content to go over stuff that has been worked through many times in the  1990s.  Dysfunctional families like this in 1997s Ice Storm, a few Usual  Suspects style plot twists, and a Lolita complex.  What is so special about  Sam Mendes' contribution to this film is, I do not know. It just looks like  a competently shot film with a few dream sequences in which rose petals  (hammer us with the symbolism a little more why don't you?) float around a  lot.  The Rickey Fitts character is also a little disappointing, being used  a) as a weirdo for visual purposes/ directing gimmicks and b) as a  mouthpiece for the film's philosophy-lite.It was a good movie, but if  you really want a film that looks into twisted human nature, go watch  Herzog, not Sam Mendes. If you want to learn to appreciate beauty in the  world, take a walk in the woods.  I don't think this film really knew what  it wanted to do.

But as is so often true in these modern times, a lot of dysfunction hides behind the mask of happy normalcy.In truth, Lester (Kevin Spacey) is going middle age crazy, pining for his carefree youth and making goo-goo eyes at his daughter's Lolita-like best friend. Carolyn (Annette Bening) has discovered that ""having it all"" isn't nearly enough; she throws herself into her real estate job to try to compensate. And the daughter is going through that economy sized variety pack of teen angst, ranging from insecurity to parent loathing. Add in a set of new next door neighbors with their own problems (Dad's a bigoted ex-Marine; Mom's a zoned out space case, and son is a fairly creepy video voyeur); stir them all together well, and you have the perfect recipe for suburban disaster.Director Sam Mendes, writer Alan Bell, and especially the actors make the most of this dramatic black comedy. The mix is perfectly realized, with laugh out loud scenes that nonetheless have a sense of tragedy and doom about them.Writer Ball has a background in sitcoms, so it's no surprise that ther is a lot of sharp tongued verbal byplay. More surprising is how well a thirty-four year old director can guide his actors through the minefield of fortysomething neuroses. But then, you don't hire actors like Spacey and Bening because they'll do a mean karaoke at the wrap party. Spacey is as excellent as he is expected to be, and he is matched scene for scene by the slightly underrated Bening. The rest of the cast lend fine support, with newcomer Wes Bentley standing out.This is a quirky, somewhat unusual film, with a few stylized fantasy scenes that add to the flavor overall. If you enjoy such productions, this is definitely a good choice to sink your teeth into. Also with Peter Gallagher (Summer Lovers) and Chris Cooper (Lone Star).",4,Seems like the perfect life.

67504,A26BWRBPP4V2WF,0783239408,Craig MACKINNON,"[3, 5]","I didn't read all 600+ reviews for American Beauty listed on the Amazon site, but a cursory look gives me the impression that people get very polarised over this movie, and I can't understand why.  Is it an art movie?  Not really.  But it's as close as a Hollywood movie is likely to get, I suppose.  The acting is superb, but the characters are very two-dimensional.  Surprisingly, the most realistic character (to me) was the &quot;Beauty&quot; herself, Angela, who, as the object of male fantasies, would normally be the most two-dimensional.  So, while I enjoyed the movie, I don't care to watch it over and over.  It is dark, but heartwarming in its way, and parts are very funny as well.The DVD additives are also only okay.

Such is the case of Alan Ball's excellent script; Sam Mendes' direction; and the exemplary acting of an uparalleled group of actors.In ""American Beauty"", viewers will find themselves rooting cheerfully for Lester Burnham, the movies key character brilliantly played by Kevin Spacey.  Burnham is a man going through a mid-life crisis slash awakening in a plot that turns out to be a mystery, drama, tragic comedy and satire all rolled into a finely crafted story.This film dares to show the sarcastic contradictions that occur in everyday life.  For those quick to judge others, this will hopefully be an eye opener as to what the effects of those judgments can have on life and death.I think most viewers will be able to relate to at least one of the unique characters created in this picture, which garnered 5 Oscars, including Best Picture, in 1999.  Personally, I fell in love and lust respectively with Thora Birch and Mena Suvari.  The other characters are brought to life in exemplary fashion by Spacey, Annette Bening, Wes Bentley, Chris Cooper, Peter Gallagher, Allison Janey and Scott Bakula.  They all interact together and astutely show the everyday foibles, humor, tragedy and other unique circumstances that occur in suburban life.If you've already seen ""American Beauty"", you know how great it is; if you haven't viewed it yet, do so immediately--you won't regret it...",5,"This Film Truly is an ""American Beauty""",1285372800,"09 25, 2010",2010,1469,"['Sometimes', 'several', 'different', 'things', 'come', 'together', 'form', 'truly', 'unique', 'work', 'art', 'Such', 'case', 'Alan', 'Ball', 'excellent', 'script', 'Sam', 'Mendes', 'direction', 'exemplary', 'acting', 'uparalleled', 'group', 'actors.In', 'American', 'Beauty', 'viewers', 'will', 'find', 'rooting', 'cheerfully', 'Lester', 'Burnham', 'movies', 'key', 'character', 'brilliantly', 'played', 'Kevin', 'Spacey', 'Burnham', 'man', 'going', 'mid-life', 'crisis', 'slash', 'awakening', 'plot', 'out', 'be', 'mystery', 'drama', 'tragic', 'comedy', 'satire', 'rolled', 'finely', 'crafted', 'story.This', 'film', 'dares', 'show', 'sarcastic', 'contradictions', 'occur', 'everyday', 'life', 'quick', 'judge', 'others', 'will', 'hopefully', 'be', 'eye', 'opener', 'what', 'effects', 'judgments', 'can', 'have', 'life', 'death.I', 'think', 'most', 'viewers', 'will', 'be', 'able', 'relate', 'least', 'one', 'unique', 'characters', 'created', 'picture', 'garnered', '5', 'Oscars', 'including', 'Best', 'Picture', '1999', 'Personally', 'fell', 'love', 'lust', 'respectively', 'Thora', 'Birch', 'Mena', 'Suvari', 'other', 'characters', 'are', 'brought', 'life', 'exemplary', 'fashion', 'Spacey', 'Annette', 'Bening', 'Wes', 'Bentley', 'Chris', 'Cooper', 'Peter', 'Gallagher', 'Allison', 'Janey', 'Scott', 'Bakula', 'interact', 'together', 'astutely', 'show', 'everyday', 'foibles', 'humor', 'tragedy', 'other', 'unique', 'circumstances', 'occur', 'suburban', 'life.If', ""'ve"", 'already', 'seen', 'American', 'Beauty', 'know', 'how', 'great', 'have', ""n't"", 'viewed', 'yet', 'do', 'so', 'immediately', 'wo', ""n't"", 'regret']",Belleza Americana American Beauty  VHS

67512,A1R8AO9XASQ15C,0783239408,Daniel A. Marsh,"[1, 3]","I used to have arguments with people at work over whether ""American Beauty"" is a movie primarily for guys. It is told, after all, strictly from a man's perspective -- Lester Burnham's, namely, since after all, he is dead and presumably all knowing. Maybe that is why Caroline Burnham is portrayed as such a shrew, and why virtually everyone else in the picture is viewed with such cold-hearted negativity -- including the children. That is how Lester experienced them, or imagined himself experiencing them. So, from his rather narrow point of view, the portrayals do make sense.Such arguments are irrelevent, but they do make a point: ""American Beauty"" is a film you can't help but talk about and play over and over in your mind. For a while there back in 1999, I had the dazzling idea that movies were going to actually get better ... only to see an endless supply of greedy sequels pile into the multiplexes, making a film like ""American Beauty"" all the more rare and, well, beautiful.People who complain about the movie's subject matter, about its language and sexuality, who actually walked out of the theater ... well, all I can say is, they should figure out in advance what a movie is about and decide beforehand whether it's something they want to pay to see. The only movie I ever walked out of was ""Battlefield Earth,"" and only because it was stupid to the point of mental paralysis. ""American Beauty"" may make you angry, but it is not stupid, or dirty, or vulgar. That some people found it shocking may say more about them than about the quality of the movie.First and foremost, ""American Beauty"" is a comedy, and one of the blackest since, I dunno, ""Dr. Strangelove,"" or maybe ""MASH."" It is like a television sitcom pushed to the edge of nightmare, with the classical sitcom ""dad"" (Kevin Spacey) waking up to a new life and realizing that he's surrounded not just by boring, uninteresting people, but crazy, selfish, materialistic people. He realizes he doesn't really know his wife and that they should rekindle what they had before Grown Up Life intruded. He realizes he hasn't been communicating with his self-absorbed daughter, and that although he should do something about it, he doesn't quite know what. He realizes he had a lot more fun when he was a kid. He realizes his job sucks. And he realizes that he is, indeed, a sexual creature, though the object of his obsession (Mena Suvari, wonderful) makes him more of a pervert than a stud.The movie is a dark, nighttime journey through Lester's mind, and though it expands to include the next-door neighbors and their troubled lives, it is truly limited to his perspective and is, in fact, about him and no one else. Yeah, his activities border on criminal, and no, you shouldn't really mix weight-lifting with dope smoking and beer guzzling, but he's burning off 20 wasted years, and he does finally come around at the end.The supremely shocking thing is that Lester meets his ultimate fate just at the moment that he realizes life maybe ain't so bad, after all. He's robbed of his life just when he learns to appreciate it. How else to describe it, but as a cosmic jest at Lester's expense?The movie is excellent on every level, from the tremendous performances to the fantastic screenplay to Sam Mendes' atmospheric direction. It is by turns hilariously funny and somberly dramatic. It is unpredictable and insightful about the way Americans live, a quality I cherish above any CGI effect you can imagine. That it is just a little cold, just a little austere, and just a little too pessimistic, is a flaw I'm willing to live with because othewise there is so much much to enjoy here. Was it honestly the best picture of a great year at the movies, a year that saw the release of ""Magnolia,"" ""The Green Mile,"" ""Eyes Wide Shut"" and ""Fight Club""? Yeah.

Not to worry, he rejuvenates himself by seducing Angela, his daughter's best friend, quitting his job, working out and drinking smoothies, listening to Pink Floyd and Bob Dylan, smoking dope, throwing dishes against the wall, getting a new job at Smiley's Hamburgers, and buying a 1970 Pontiac Firebird. Self destruction as personal makeover? Life is beautiful, as he proclaims at the end of the film? Yeah, right. His wife Carolyn is an obsessive phony who lives only for image and finds her own authenticity by bedding her chief real estate competitor.

67514,A2BIWMWF995A7Y,0783239408,DANIEL G. MADIGAN,"[0, 0]","American Beauty is about the marriage of a guy who is at best deep at the surface. His recollections of his past at the end are none too deep either..they're shot in black and white and reminded me of early 60's nostalgia pieces like To Kill A Mockingbird, utterly unconvincing.Annette Benning and Kevin Spacey as husband and wife(brillantly played by both) have entered the competitive world of America and it is shattering their marriage and their integrity. They make absurd choices that entrap them further, so that finally murder and death wishes(she wants to shoot him and he lusts for a Lolita looka like and deals with drugs with a teenager , which looks like gay sex to the teen's father..all of it crazy and risky) become suitable options for this couple who do anyhting but RULE.The children of American Beauty are anti- American Dream in every way; their vocabulary is cynical jargon designed to disarm and also to protect them from the crushing world of adult relationships in which they find themselves asked to model. They look better than the adults aS they see through the sexuaL and psychological messes in front of them. They have to survive and do so with some imagination, except for the blonde girl who is Spacey's object of desire; she's dull, unimaginative, and one of them puts it, sadly knows it.The Marine Major's wife with her catatonia is superb; she typifies the only stance one could take in this very real world of realtionships..silence and immobility, a willed retreat into madness as a seal on whatever humanity she has left.The end  of the film shakes it all up, and the film turns into a who dunnit with the principal parties as potential suspects of murder. This throws the film into another genre..a sort of Agatha Christie plot, where Miss Marple will come and figure it all out. Kevinb Spacey leaves a puzzle behind, but it is a bland one, easy to decipher..there';s nothing worth the trouble in this world, and kids in it know it.American Beauty as a term and not a title, seen in part in the sexy use of rose petals, is a fading illusion, a cliche, and  truth, as Spacey alludes to in the end,  is nowhere to be found in this environment..as truth seems to be at the bottom of a bottomless well...like the dreams they all have, fractured by their own loneliness and sad belief that marriage is as good as it gets, or that independent living without depth is better. the gay guys  too have unfortunately assimilated and they look bad, ignoring the reality of homophobia, not wrestling with any issues at all. Part of the issues not faced by the gay couple is the marine next door trying to forge a desperate realtionship with Kevin Spacey, that becomes ultimately deadly, unfulfilled, and a bit shocking in its conclusion, but maybe the only complete intercourse in the film..it gets a little beyond the Hitler plate that the Marine keeps under glass, and closer to the white bag in motion, not stagnant. But this is all framed in a world of absurdity.See this film and never mind the reviews of those who only saw it on video tape with pizza interruptions etc...It's for adults, and for people who have a background and a foreground.",5,Great Film In Every Way,972000000,"10 20, 2000",2000,3176,"['American', 'Beauty', 'marriage', 'guy', 'who', 'best', 'deep', 'surface', 'recollections', 'past', 'end', 'are', 'none', 'too', 'deep', 'either..they', ""'re"", 'shot', 'black', 'white', 'reminded', 'early', '60', 'nostalgia', 'pieces', 'Kill', 'A', 'Mockingbird', 'utterly', 'unconvincing.Annette', 'Benning', 'Kevin', 'Spacey', 'husband', 'wife', 'brillantly', 'played', 'have', 'entered', 'competitive', 'world', 'America', 'shattering', 'marriage', 'integrity', 'make', 'absurd', 'choices', 'entrap', 'further', 'finally', 'murder', 'death', 'wishes', 'shoot', 'Lolita', 'looka', 'deals', 'drugs', 'teenager', 'gay', 'sex', 'teen', 'father..all', 'crazy', 'risky', 'become', 'suitable', 'options', 'couple', 'who', 'do', 'anyhting', 'RULE.The', 'children', 'American', 'Beauty', 'are', 'anti-', 'American', 'Dream', 'way', 'vocabulary', 'cynical', 'jargon', 'designed', 'disarm', 'also', 'protect', 'crushing', 'world', 'adult', 'relationships', 'find', 'asked', 'model', 'look', 'better', 'adults', 'see', 'sexuaL', 'psychological', 'messes', 'front', 'have', 'survive', 'do', 'so', 'imagination', 'blonde', 'girl', 'who', 'Spacey', 'object', 'desire', 'dull', 'unimaginative', 'one', 'sadly', 'it.The', 'Marine', 'Major', 'wife', 'catatonia', 'superb', 'only', 'stance', 'one', 'could', 'take', 'very', 'real', 'world', 'realtionships..silence', 'immobility', 'willed', 'retreat', 'madness', 'seal', 'humanity', 'left.The', 'end', 'film', 'up', 'film', 'who', 'principal', 'parties', 'potential', 'suspects', 'murder', 'film', 'genre..a', 'sort', 'Agatha', 'Christie', 'plot', 'where', 'Miss', 'Marple', 'will', 'come', 'figure', 'out', 'Kevinb', 'Spacey', 'puzzle', 'bland', 'one', 'decipher..there', 's', 'nothing', 'trouble', 'world', 'kids', 'know', 'it.American', 'Beauty', 'term', 'not', 'title', 'seen', 'part', 'sexy', 'use', 'rose', 'petals', 'fading', 'illusion', 'cliche', 'truth', 'Spacey', 'end', 'nowhere', 'be', 'found', 'environment..as', 'truth', 'be', 'bottom', 'bottomless', 'well', 'dreams', 'have', 'fractured', 'own', 'loneliness', 'sad', 'belief', 'marriage', 'as', 'good', 'independent', 'living', 'depth', 'better', 'gay', 'guys', 'too', 'have', 'unfortunately', 'assimilated', 'look', 'bad', 'ignoring', 'reality', 'homophobia', 'not', 'wrestling', 'issues', 'Part', 'issues', 'not', 'faced', 'gay', 'couple', 'marine', 'next', 'door', 'trying', 'forge', 'desperate', 'realtionship', 'Kevin', 'Spacey', 'ultimately', 'deadly', 'unfulfilled', 'bit', 'shocking', 'conclusion', 'maybe', 'only', 'complete', 'intercourse', 'film..it', 'little', 'Hitler', 'plate', 'Marine', 'keeps', 'glass', 'closer', 'white', 'bag', 'motion', 'not', 'stagnant', 'framed', 'world', 'absurdity.See', 'film', 'never', 'mind', 'reviews', 'who', 'only', 'saw', 'video', 'tape', 'pizza', 'interruptions', 'etc', 'adults', 'people', 'who', 'have', 'background', 'foreground']",Belleza Americana American Beauty  VHS

It remains to be seen yet if this becomes a real classic.  There was a line in Kevin Spacey's voiceover that goes something like this:  &quot;You know, it's been said that every day is the first day of the rest of your life.  And that's true of every day except one:  the day you die.&quot;  I was struck by this line the very first time I watched this movie in the theater, and I instantly wished that I had written it.

67516,A3KF4IP2MUS8QQ,0783239408,"Daniel Jolley ""darkgenius""","[3, 5]","American Beauty is not one of those movies you simply watch and quickly forget, and it's awfully hard to review.  Only once have I walked away in mid-review, feeling quite unable to do a subject justice, but I am ready now to start again and offer my own thoughts on this extraordinary film.  You know a film is something special when you wonder so many people could possibly like it.  I think American Beauty can justifiably be called quite weird, and the treatment of subjects such as a relationship between a forty-two-year-old man and a seventeen-year-old girl, complete family dysfunctionality, and murder most foul doesn't normally result in critical as well as box office success, not to mention such honors as Best Picture awards.  One thing this movie certainly has going for it is its shockingly original nature; no one had made a movie quite like this before.  What strikes me as really quite amazing is the fact that, despite all the buzz about this movie, I still had little idea of what to expect once I finally watched it for myself.  Then there is the talented cast; I can take or leave Kevin Spacey, and I do not like Annette Bening, but I can't deny their talents; I will admit that Mena Suvari was a prime motivator in my own initial attraction to this movie, though.  All told, each member of the cast gave a brilliant performance.  Then there is the incredible musical score, as well as the mesmerizing cinematography.  Of course, the heart of American Beauty is its story.The characters in this film are all living lives of quiet (sometimes not so quiet) desperation, and that is the source of the appeal to so many people.  Today's reality is unreality.  Some individuals might think they want nothing more than a normal life, but I believe that, deep down, no one wants to be ordinary.  Everyone wants to find a meaning for his/her life, even those who convince themselves otherwise.  Who of us is really happy?  American Beauty helps us acknowledge our own dreams of meaning and understanding, while at the same time it offers a level of comfort to those of us conscious of our unfulfilling lives.  The characters in this film come off as quite real, albeit a surreal form of real, and they are screwed up more than we are.  Lester Burnham even succeeds in finding a part of what he has been missing all his life, although that incredibly victorious moment is cut short at the end.  No one is whom they claim to be here, each character hiding secrets that are ultimately brought to light in the hypnotizing final moments; there are some significant revelations that many viewers may not anticipate.  These characters aren't truly fake, however; they are just unhappy.  While all of this intense emotional drama could well afflict the viewer with something akin to depression, American Beauty somehow manages to deliver a message of, if not hope then at least understanding and mutual sympathy, supporting us with many moments of dark comedy along the way, holding our hands down the long passage to the ultimate door of revelation.  And it is the most troubled individual of all who shows us that there is beauty in even the ugliest of circumstances, if we will just stop and look for it.",5,A mesmerizing experience for both mind and soul,1053043200,"05 16, 2003",2003,3213,"['American', 'Beauty', 'not', 'one', 'movies', 'simply', 'watch', 'quickly', 'forget', 'awfully', 'hard', 'review', 'Only', 'once', 'have', 'walked', 'away', 'mid-review', 'feeling', 'quite', 'unable', 'do', 'subject', 'justice', 'am', 'ready', 'now', 'start', 'again', 'offer', 'own', 'thoughts', 'extraordinary', 'film', 'know', 'film', 'something', 'special', 'when', 'wonder', 'so', 'many', 'people', 'could', 'possibly', 'like', 'think', 'American', 'Beauty', 'can', 'justifiably', 'be', 'called', 'quite', 'weird', 'treatment', 'subjects', 'such', 'relationship', 'forty-two-year-old', 'man', 'seventeen-year-old', 'girl', 'complete', 'family', 'dysfunctionality', 'murder', 'most', 'foul', ""n't"", 'normally', 'result', 'critical', 'as', 'well', 'box', 'office', 'success', 'not', 'mention', 'such', 'honors', 'Best', 'Picture', 'awards', 'One', 'thing', 'movie', 'certainly', 'going', 'shockingly', 'original', 'nature', 'one', 'had', 'made', 'movie', 'quite', 'before', 'What', 'really', 'quite', 'amazing', 'fact', 'buzz', 'movie', 'still', 'had', 'little', 'idea', 'what', 'expect', 'once', 'finally', 'watched', 'Then', 'talented', 'cast', 'can', 'take', 'leave', 'Kevin', 'Spacey', 'do', 'not', 'Annette', 'Bening', 'ca', ""n't"", 'deny', 'talents', 'will', 'admit', 'Mena', 'Suvari', 'was', 'prime', 'motivator', 'own', 'initial', 'attraction', 'movie', 'though', 'told', 'member', 'cast', 'gave', 'brilliant', 'performance', 'Then', 'incredible', 'musical', 'score', 'as', 'well', 'mesmerizing', 'cinematography', 'course', 'heart', 'American', 'Beauty', 'story.The', 'characters', 'film', 'are', 'living', 'lives', 'quiet', 'sometimes', 'not', 'quiet', 'desperation', 'source', 'appeal', 'so', 'many', 'people', 'Today', 'reality', 'unreality', 'individuals', 'might', 'think', 'want', 'nothing', 'more', 'normal', 'life', 'believe', 'deep', 'down', 'one', 'be', 'ordinary', 'Everyone', 'find', 'meaning', 'his/her', 'life', 'even', 'who', 'convince', 'otherwise', 'Who', 'really', 'happy', 'American', 'Beauty', 'acknowledge', 'own', 'dreams', 'meaning', 'understanding', 'same', 'time', 'level', 'comfort', 'conscious', 'unfulfilling', 'lives', 'characters', 'film', 'come', 'off', 'quite', 'real', 'surreal', 'form', 'real', 'are', 'screwed', 'more', 'are', 'Lester', 'Burnham', 'even', 'finding', 'part', 'what', 'been', 'missing', 'life', 'incredibly', 'victorious', 'moment', 'cut', 'short', 'end', 'one', 'whom', 'claim', 'be', 'here', 'character', 'hiding', 'secrets', 'are', 'ultimately', 'brought', 'light', 'hypnotizing', 'final', 'moments', 'are', 'significant', 'revelations', 'many', 'viewers', 'may', 'not', 'anticipate', 'characters', 'are', ""n't"", 'truly', 'fake', 'however', 'are', 'just', 'unhappy', 'intense', 'emotional', 'drama', 'could', 'well', 'afflict', 'viewer', 'something', 'akin', 'depression', 'American', 'Beauty', 'somehow', 'manages', 'deliver', 'message', 'not', 'hope', 'then', 'least', 'understanding', 'mutual', 'sympathy', 'supporting', 'many', 'moments', 'dark', 'comedy', 'way', 'holding', 'hands', 'down', 'long', 'passage', 'ultimate', 'door', 'revelation', 'most', 'troubled', 'individual', 'who', 'beauty', 'even', 'ugliest', 'circumstances', 'will', 'just', 'stop', 'look']",Belleza Americana American Beauty  VHS
67517,A2GYX971VETQBV,0783239408,Daniel R. Sanderman,"[3, 4]","""American Beauty"" is a truly rare film, in my opinion.  But not in the way that most reviewers will tell you.  I could certainly mention the awards it has won, its delicate play of satire, etc.  But it is rare to me because it is one of the few films I can watch over and over and never tire.  The cast is alive in this film, the emotions are real, and it's all in your face.  The chemistry that is created on-screen in this film is unparalleled in recent years.  It definitely has the feel of a play, where the cast is not separated from each other.  It's quite likely that Sam Mendes brought this attribute from his stage experience and introduced it to the film.  I can only say that it works marvelously.  Kevin Spacey is brilliant and Annette Bening manages to create sympathy for a character to whom I truly did not want to become attached.A dear friend of mine is disturbed by the ""perverse"" sexual content in the film.  I can only say that this film is dealing with that perversity and finding that it is, perhaps, more natural and less perverse than we may think.  In the very least, it is an aspect of our lives that is right under our noses whether or not we are aware of it.  This film manages to present America, in all of its faults and failures.  And yet out of those faults, life as we know it emerges.  And life is a wonderful thing, any way you slice it.With great directing, a truly memorable cast, and a stirring soundtrack, ""American Beauty"" promises to be a film that I will continue to watch many years to come.

67520,A31LHED3SKLWVB,0783239408,Darren,"[0, 1]","Taboo subject-matter, such as a 42-year-old man's infatuation with a 16-year-old girl, is really just impossible to depict honestly ... unless you're a literary master like Vladimir Nabokov (please note that I'm referring to the novel, not any filmed version of ""Lolita""), and, I'm sorry to say, Alan Ball is not quite Nabokov.  Hence the rose-petals here, I suppose.  Of course, no man has fantasies like Kevin Spacey has about Mena Suvari; the actual daydreams would be far dirtier.  But an honest depiction would be morally repugnant to viewers, so we're presented with weird symbolic substitutes.  I might have recommended that there be no ""fantasies"" at all -- Spacey and the script make it funnily abundant that his character is in the grips of mid-life dotage already without such literal-minded symbolism.  But, throughout ""American Beauty"", Ball demonstrates that he doesn't trust the audience's acumen about his story; all too often, he apparently feels that he must spell everything out for us in the simplest possible way.  The worst symbolic bit:  a plastic bag, blowing in the breeze.  What's that supposed to be? -- the flimsy human soul, buffeted about by the universe?  Or something so beautiful that it makes your heart burst, as Wes Bentley says with tears welling up?  Oh come on now!With the sole exception of Kevin Spacey's Lester, all the adults in the film are cartoons, constructed to bring home various points about the presumed horrible inadequacies of suburbia.  We have: the gay couple who bring fruit baskets to new neighbors and admire the neighbor lady's rose garden; the smarmy boss; the violent, seething, repressed Marine father and his lobotomized wife; and, worst of all, Annette Bening as Spacey's spouse, a sort of harpy version of Daffy Duck.  Bening's character is not believable.  Which would be OK if the movie wasn't more or less a sober drama with some comic points.  She might work in a total farce or perhaps in a Bunuel picture.  But here, she's just a punching bag for Spacey's mid-life crisis.  Bening, by the way, tries her very best to wring as much humanity as she can from the character -- she's a truly great actor, let me say at once -- but the script just won't set her free.  Two other great actors, Chris Cooper and Allison Janney, labor under the same one-dimensional imprisonment.  Bening, Cooper, and Janney are like Zod and his henchmen from ""Superman 2"", trapped in a thin plane of glass.  I can't believe a movie with such talented actors can't find more for them to do.The kids, Thora Birch as the miserable teenage daughter, Mena Suvari as her slutty friend, and Wes Bentley as her boyfriend, fare much better than their elders.  Perhaps this is because kids are easier to write than adults, and their problems seem one-dimensional, anyway.  In particular, I thought the whole scene late in the film between Spacey and Suvari was well-written and especially well-performed:  a seduction, a nervous trembling from one party and a rather ruthless desire from another, and an admission that breaks the whole spell.  Difficult to execute, but done superbly.  Not all the other dramatic crises are done as well, though.While this review has mostly focused on what I think are its shortcomings, I do have to say that Kevin Spacey (and to a lesser degree, the kids) engage us and drive things forward.  Some bits are quite well-written and funny.  It's not a bad picture, by any means.  But I do think the criticisms that Ball is grinding a few axes are eminently fair.

Stop pretending to be this normal, straight laced, 'make room for daddy' household and see life for what it truly is... beautiful beyond words.  There is an intertwined, complex weave between all our lives and that is the beauty of living.  Not everyone is the same and there is no such thing as &quot;normal&quot; except for the people who are too afraid to open up and embrace our differences (racists, ignorant people, fanatical religous groups).  If we were all the same wouldn't it be a very boring and ORDINARY world - difference makes it exciting, unique, and yes sometimes strange and wierd.  Take the good with the bad.I loved this movie because it moves and inspires me.  It is more than eye candy pandering to the lowest intellectual level (Titanic, Matrix, Die Hard, Zorro, and Timecop).  This movie means something and people who don't like it are afraid to admit how realistic it is.  We all have dysfunction in our lives, no one is the typical 'leave it to beaver' family.  This movie shows us the beauty of our differences with a style and story like no other.  This movie didn't win enough awards in my opinion.

The movie premiered on September 8th, 1999 in Los Angeles California.  It won 5 Academy Awards, including:  Best Actor in a Leading Role (Kevin Spacey), Best Cinematography (Conrad L. Hall), Best Director (Sam Mendes), Best Picture (Bruce Cohen, Dan Jinks), and Best Writing, Screenplay Written Directly for the Screen (Alan Ball).  It was also nominated for three other awards, including:  Best Actress in a Leading Role (Annette Bening), Best Editing (Tariq Anwar), and Best Music, Original Score (Thomas Newman).This is a great movie from all aspects, and that starts with a superb script.  The script gives us the characters with whom the audience can identify, and dialogue and situations which are both humorous and poignant.  Next we have the cinematography which is simply beautiful, and is accented wonderfully by the score.  Finally, there is the acting which is excellent throughout.  While Kevin Spacey and Annette Bening received the nominations, the performances of Thora Birch, Ricky Fitts, Angela Hayes, and Chris Cooper are all very good, and even the more minor roles of Peter Gallagher and Allison Janney contribute significantly to the overall feel of the movie.I have seen this movie at least five times now, and each time I have focused on different aspects and themes of the story.  The first viewing, assuming it hasn't been spoiled; one gets the initial surprises at the end of the movie.  Subsequent viewing though are still just as good, because one notices more the overall themes: the lack of communication, the different facades that the characters wear, the loneliness of the characters, even when they are together.  Certainly these themes interrelate, but it is also interesting to look at each on its own to see how the director used the camera, the actors, and the music to show them to the audience.The DVD includes several special features, but it would be worth owning even if it only contained the movie.  My favorite feature would be the commentary with Director Sam Mendes and Writer Alan Ball.  There is also a behind-the-scenes featurette, a Storyboard Presentation with additional commentary by Sam Mendes and the Director of Photography, Conrad L. Hall, the cast and crew biographies, production notes, and trailers for the movie.  There are also some DVD-ROM features which you can look at on your computer.If you are looking for a typical action movie or romantic comedy, then this is not the movie you want to see, but if you are looking for a unique and original movie that will restore your faith in the ability of the film industry to produce something other than sequels and remakes, then this is for you.",5,Unique And Original,1144972800,"04 14, 2006",2006,2796,"['time', 'when', 'Hollywood', 'put', 'out', 'same', 'films', 'refreshing', 'see', 'original', 'movie', 'American', 'Beauty', 'movie', 'premiered', 'September', '8th', '1999', 'Los', 'Angeles', 'California', 'won', '5', 'Academy', 'Awards', 'including', 'Best', 'Actor', 'Leading', 'Role', 'Kevin', 'Spacey', 'Best', 'Cinematography', 'Conrad', 'L.', 'Hall', 'Best', 'Director', 'Sam', 'Mendes', 'Best', 'Picture', 'Bruce', 'Cohen', 'Dan', 'Jinks', 'Best', 'Writing', 'Screenplay', 'Written', 'Directly', 'Screen', 'Alan', 'Ball', 'was', 'also', 'nominated', 'three', 'other', 'awards', 'including', 'Best', 'Actress', 'Leading', 'Role', 'Annette', 'Bening', 'Best', 'Editing', 'Tariq', 'Anwar', 'Best', 'Music', 'Original', 'Score', 'Thomas', 'Newman', '.This', 'great', 'movie', 'aspects', 'superb', 'script', 'script', 'characters', 'whom', 'audience', 'can', 'identify', 'dialogue', 'situations', 'are', 'humorous', 'poignant', 'have', 'cinematography', 'simply', 'beautiful', 'accented', 'wonderfully', 'score', 'Finally', 'acting', 'excellent', 'Kevin', 'Spacey', 'Annette', 'Bening', 'received', 'nominations', 'performances', 'Thora', 'Birch', 'Ricky', 'Fitts', 'Angela', 'Hayes', 'Chris', 'Cooper', 'are', 'very', 'good', 'even', 'more', 'minor', 'roles', 'Peter', 'Gallagher', 'Allison', 'Janney', 'significantly', 'overall', 'feel', 'movie.I', 'have', 'seen', 'movie', 'least', 'five', 'times', 'now', 'time', 'have', 'focused', 'different', 'aspects', 'themes', 'story', 'first', 'viewing', 'assuming', ""n't"", 'been', 'spoiled', 'one', 'initial', 'surprises', 'end', 'movie', 'Subsequent', 'viewing', 'are', 'still', 'just', 'as', 'good', 'one', 'notices', 'more', 'overall', 'themes', 'lack', 'communication', 'different', 'facades', 'characters', 'wear', 'loneliness', 'characters', 'even', 'when', 'are', 'together', 'Certainly', 'themes', 'interrelate', 'also', 'interesting', 'look', 'own', 'see', 'how', 'director', 'used', 'camera', 'actors', 'music', 'show', 'audience.The', 'DVD', 'several', 'special', 'features', 'would', 'be', 'worth', 'owning', 'even', 'only', 'contained', 'movie', 'favorite', 'feature', 'would', 'be', 'commentary', 'Director', 'Sam', 'Mendes', 'Writer', 'Alan', 'Ball', 'also', 'behind-the-scenes', 'featurette', 'Storyboard', 'Presentation', 'additional', 'commentary', 'Sam', 'Mendes', 'Director', 'Photography', 'Conrad', 'L.', 'Hall', 'cast', 'crew', 'biographies', 'production', 'notes', 'trailers', 'movie', 'are', 'also', 'DVD-ROM', 'features', 'can', 'look', 'computer.If', 'are', 'looking', 'typical', 'action', 'movie', 'romantic', 'comedy', 'then', 'not', 'movie', 'want', 'see', 'are', 'looking', 'unique', 'original', 'movie', 'will', 'restore', 'faith', 'ability', 'film', 'industry', 'produce', 'something', 'other', 'sequels', 'remakes', 'then']",Belleza Americana American Beauty  VHS

67527,A1T633YVOAU1YN,0783239408,David C. Glebe,"[4, 7]","I'd heard a lot of good things about this movie, including the ""Best Picture"" Oscar, but I'd never seen it until recently.  Surprisingly, it was pretty disappointing because of all of the stupid little things that didn't make sense.  When I watch a movie, I am perfectly willing to buy ""the premise,"" and to suspend my disbelief and pretend that I'm watching some actual story, not just a bunch of actors on a set saying lines.  So, when the movie begins, I'm really willing to give it a chance until....until.....the movie gets to some point where I just say to myself ""Yeah, right.""  Which means that whatever just happened has violated ""the premise"" of the story (probably because of the writer's laziness or poor editing), and is making the story unbelievable, unreal, contrived, and frankly, just stupid.  So that was my problem with this movie -- too much stuff in it was just plain STUPID.So, where to begin?Well, this movie takes itself so seriously that it actually comes with its own built-in hype, which TELLS you, in kind of an unofficial subtitle, to ""look closer.""  Okay, fine.  So you meet the Burnham family right up front, and within seconds all three of them come off as superficial, shallow, empty, bored and boring people.  Then the movie goes on, and on, and on, and what happens?  These characters have a bunch of little episodes that reveal each of them as -- shallow, empty, and boring people.  That's the result of ""looking closer,"" which is not what you expect.  Because when someone says ""look closer,"" aren't they implying that you will see something deeper and more meaningful and more important than the appearance you see at first glance?  Sure they are.  But here, when you ""look closer"" at these superficial people, YOU SEE EXACTLY THE SAME THING -- SUPERFICIAL PEOPLE, EXCEPT AT A CLOSER RANGE.  So what?I guess to be fair you might say that Spacey's character finally shows a LITTLE depth at the very end of the movie, and apparently ""grows up"" a little bit when he decides not to sexually molest his daughter's friend (how NICE of him to decide not to commit statutory rape, eh?) but really, there isn't much more to it than that.But besides the characterization problem, there are just lots of stupid little things that are very distracting, and show a remarkable sloppiness.  Why the other reviewers chose to ignore these things is puzzling to me.Some examples --The family's house -- they live in this weird house that is like a reverse Tardis from Dr. Who.  That is, from the inside it's a rather modest two-bedroom house, but from the outside it's a rather large 4-5 bedroom house, at least double the size that the interior shots reveal.  Whaddup widdat?  Another thing about the house is that, from the outside, where it appears huge, it would seem to be way more expensive than the Burnhams could afford, especially since Spacey has some dead-end job where he works from a CUBICLE.  What does that mean?  (Come on, LOOK CLOSER.)  It means he doesn't make much money.  So how can he and his wife afford that $500K mansion?  Yet another weird thing about the house -- it has all these wide-open windows, without blinds or curtains, even in the garage, so that the neighbors can conveniently watch (and film!) things that happen in the house.  Yeah, right -- happens every day.  So, so ""real,"" huh?Spacey's sexual fixation on his daughter's friend, Angela -- I guess it doesn't bother Spacey that Angela is a minor because she projects a lot of sexuality.  Okay, fine.  But then he fantasizes about her while he's lying in bed, and what's his fantasy?  That she's lying in a bed of rose petals, with various petals strategically placed over her otherwise naked body.  Yeah, right.  As if that's the way he would be imagining her, with stupid rose petals covering her up.  Yeah right, raised to the tenth power.  No man on earth would have that fantasy.  In fact, no man since the beginning of the human species would have that fantasy.  Period.  But the strange thing is, that near the end of the movie, when he is finally about to have sex with her, she actually does expose her breasts, which was totally UN-necessary to the scene or the story.  Purely gratuituous nudity, and thus insulting to the viewer.  But when Angela's nudity WOULD have been perfectly appropriate, in the fantasy sequence, THEN she's covered up.  Makes no sense.Speaking of nudity, there is also a brief shot of Jane in a topless state, also purely gratuituous, but not only that, the shot shows how extremely well-endowed she is, and yet she is saving up her money to have breast enlargement surgery.  Huh?  After Jane's nude shot, I had to rewind to the beginning because I thought, ""she must actually want a breast reduction, right?""  But no, in the beginning of the movie she is worried about being under-endowed in the breast department -- but by her nude scene, she has the over-developed body of a Vegas stripper.  Didn't anyone read both parts of the script?Going back to Angela for a minute, at the end of the film Spacey is apparently going to have sex with her right there IN HIS LIVING ROOM, when his daughter and her boyfriend are upstairs and when his wife can walk in at any minute -- yeah, right.  It's not stupid enough that he's going to risk going to jail for rape, we're supposed to believe that if someone walks into the room, he'll just ignore them, right?There are so many other stupid things like that.  The drug-dealing neighbor kid hides his pot in a drawer with a fake bottom -- as if nobody would EVER think of something so clever to hide stuff, especially his suspicious father.  But on top of this, the kid also keeps small containers of ""clean urine"" in the refrigerator in his room -- NOT HIDDEN AT ALL FROM HIS NOSY FATHER.  Why does he hide the pot, but not the urine?  Yeah, right.  Speaking of the father next door, apparently he is a Shao Lin monk in disguise, and can therefore ""walk through walls,"" because at the end of the film, although he is SOAKING WET from the rain, he's able to walk right into Spacey's kitchen, come right up behind him and shoot his pistol, all with such absolute silence and stealth that Spacey doesn't know that the dripping wet father is standing there, inches behind him.  Yeah, right.One of my favorite stupid scenes, though, is when Bening comes home and sees Spacey's new classic muscle car, which he just bought because it's something he ""always wanted.""  Then a few minutes later, he is reprimanding Bening for having bought a $4,000 silk couch, telling her that it's just ""a thing,"" and not important, and that his new non-material viewpoint allows him to see this profound truth, etc.  Well, what about the $25,000 that HE just spent on that ""thing"" in the driveway?  What's the big difference?  And then, Spacey gets a ""fun"" and ""carefree"" job at a fast food place after he quits his old job -- as if that kind minimum wage job is anything but pure drudgery and hard work, not ""fun"" at all.  Why isn't he shown mopping the floors and emptying the trash into the stinking dumpster out back?  That's what he'd really be doing in such a ""fun"" job.  And why don't they show him getting his first fast-food-job-paycheck, for less than he used to make in one day at his old job?  I guess he has no worries about his only daughter's possible college plans, eh?  No, nobody with a single teenage child worries about that.  Yeah, right.How so many reviewers can see this as some kind of ""gutsy"" or even ""artsy"" film is beyond me.  It had some promise, and I actually did like some of the insights that the neighbor drug-dealer kid imparted, but there are just too many ""yeah right"" moments otherwise, from beginning to end, to make this worthwhile.  I guess there were not that many good movies in 1999, relatively speaking, if this one got an award for being ""the best.""",2,Seemed promising but too many stupid things here,1345420800,"08 20,

I enjoy(ed) both immensely for their entertainment value, yet I cannot help but be disturbed by some the cultural messages that they glorify.Sam Mendes has, indeed, put together an unforgettable movie. You have Kevin Spacey giving the performance of a career as Lester Burnham, a straight-laced company man whose mid-life crisis begins when he meets the Lolita-like friend of his daughter. Mena Suvari is excellent as the aforementioned kittenish Angela--beautiful on the outside but oh-so ugly on the inside. Annette Bening plays Spacey's frustrated wife, a woman who is abhorred by her husband's descent into drugs, fast women, and fast cars, but isn't above getting a little on the side herself (courtesy of a real estate tycoon played by Peter Gallagher).Thora Birch is in the role of Spacey's daughter, Jane, and gives an admirable performance of a teenager yearning for a way out of her dysfunctional family. She finds that exit in the form of Wes Bentley, who plays Ricky Fitts, a quiet teenage boy who moves into the house next door. He also moonlights as a major drug dealer, one client of whom happens to be Jane's father. Bentley's performance is truly superb.Rounding out the major players includes Chris Cooper, as Ricky's father, a Marine Corp colonel with a very, very nasty side to him; and Allison Janney as Ricky's mother, who appears shell-shocked throughout the entire movie--no doubt as the result of physical abuse inflicted upon her by her husband. Both Cooper and Janney deserved to win Oscars.The musical score and cinematography are both outstanding.Despite my reservations over staring at such a sociological train wreck, I highly recommend this movie.

Is there no longer any feeling of loyalty to one's spouse, and the sanctity  of a sexual relationship in the binding promises of marriage? Again,  apparently not. Our soceity is one which supports movies such as this.  Period. We not only practice the things seen in this movie regularly, but  approve and give praise and WORSHIP to those who carry them out in the  public's eye. Ours in a fallen society, no mistake.This movie is simply  disturbing and grotesque in the most immoral of ways. This film is supposed  to bring forth the hidden evils of the family life in America? Perhaps the  family life of the producer of this film, but certainly not the family life  of people who still hold guidelines and laws in their lives. This is just  one big attempt to make immoral people feel good about themselves; like  their mistakes and sins are perfectly normal behavior for human beings, and  there's no reason to not carry them out. This film is simply one big  &quot;feel-good-about-myself&quot; piece of junk, laced with the most awful  morals and standards conceivable. The thought of killing one's parents is  not something every child is born with; the sexual misrepresentation in  this film is not normal; the apperant lusting in this film is not normal;  most of this film is just a play to try and make the family something it's  not. I can't believe that such a gross and disturbing film has the name  &quot;American&quot; in it; the same word that means liberty, law, and  justice around the world.Is this the kind of substance we want our  children growing up around? Yes, children have, do, and will see this film  many times. A society in which the family unit operates like this cannot  exist, and it's more than obvious to me that this is the direction America  is taking right now. A society that glorifies perversion, unfaithfulness,  murder, ungodliness, and a hand full of other vices is doomed to  extinction.

Next door we have, just moving in, 18-year-old Ricky Fitts, played  with sly self-assurance by Wes Bentley, the dope-dealing, Bible-suit  wearing, photog son of Marine Corps Colonel Frank Fitts and his mostly  catatonic wife.  Two houses down there's Jim and Jim, your smiling yuppie  fruit loops and all-around neighborhood sweet guys.  They are however an  embarrassment to Colonel Fitts who is living in the deep, dark corner of a  very large denial closet, paranoid to the teeth that his only son has  inherited the same shameful desires and will act them out.  In an effort to  keep Ricky disciplined and on the straight and narrow, the good Colonel  practices various forms of child abuse ranging from bare-knuckle beatings  to medicated imprisonment.In other words what we have here is your  typical American suburban street.  What makes American Beauty a great  success is a witty script with a deep and beautiful lesson for our age by  Alan Ball, superb direction by Sam Mendes and outstanding performances from  just about everybody in the cast.  Bening is brilliant with her silly  finger gestures and her one foot sideways stance, like a fawn just learning  to walk, and her squinty little eyes full of merriment, and that raised and  then downward pointing index finger of indignant reproof.  (But she really  needs to keep her pretty shins off the bedposts or at least off the wall.)  Mena Suvari is perhaps no more beautiful than any number of other screen  darlings, but she has a litany of sexy expressions and poses that inspire  delight.  Her portrayal of a fast lane teen siren whose talk is bigger than  her experience is just perfect.  She might be a budding star.But more  than anything this is an uplifting and satisfying tale of an unappreciated,  unloved and mostly ignored man who is inspired to transform his life by the  beauty of a girl.  For many people (and for most women, I would wager)  falling in love at first sight with a teenaged girl just because she is  beautiful is shallow and beside the point, inappropriate and not fair.  But  women love men for their power and their strength and their standing in  society.  Is that fair to those men who have none?  Lester's love for  Angela was so great that it transcended carnality, but he didn't know that  until he began to take off her clothes and then he realized something very  beautiful.  He could love her without making love to her.  If he took  advantage of her youth and inexperience, it would cheapen his love for her  and possibly destroy it.  Maybe some people in the audience felt he wasn't  a real man because he stopped, but I tend to feel the opposite.  Not that I  think there is anything wrong with making love to 18-year-old girls (on the  contrary); but if the girl is incapable of experiencing that love, then  perhaps it is better to love her from afar without a sexual expression,  even at the risk of disappointing her, especially if you're old enough to  be her father, and especially if you really do love her.  Notice that in  the next scene she is bored and for her the magic of sexuality is gone.  He  might as well be her father.So much of what we are presented through the  media is a focus on those males who would only be able to express  themselves in some sexually-exploitive manner.  So much of what we read  insists that this is the only way men are.  I'm happy to say that American  Beauty presents another point of view, and presents it beautifully.The  point made by the surprising ending (and the reason for the presence of the  Marine colonel and the two gay guys) is that our contemporary ""enlightened""  society may recognize the legitimacy of homosexual love, but continues to  hypocritically condemn the love of a man for a young girl.--Dennis Littrell, author of ""Cut to the Chaise Lounge or I Can't Believe I Swallowed the Remote!""",5,Middle-aged crazy,958694400,"05 19, 2000",2000,4690,"['Lester', 'Burnham', 'Kevin',

Almost everyone in the class (myself included) was overcome by the &quot;Freudian Syndrome&quot; of believing every neurotic symptom described in the book applied to our lives.  Our teacher cheerfully explained this common phenomenon would occur and only those on the extreme end of the spectrum would be considered truly sick.This movie is one giant Freudian Syndrome.  The characters somehow connect with us because we have experienced their traumas at one point or another in our lives.  I tried not to be cynical, but I found it difficult to sympathize (or empathize) with any of the characters due to the fact that they are all so far &quot;out there&quot;.  Not to mention, many other reviewers have already pointed out the numerous &quot;common sense&quot; problems of who they choose to interact with and the reasons given in the movie as to why each person made the choices they did.

The film is one of the most artistically accomplished  - silent and naunced - dissecting each character like peeling the petals of  the rose. Kevin Spacey is unequivocally the scene-stealer with stealthy  emotions - from a deranged husband, a triumph and a tender father - his  expression shows it all. Annette Benning is energized as the money-grubbing  wife Carolyn who is disillusioned by the pursue of money. Voyeurism and  homosexuality is reflected with clear-cutting honesty.The exquisite  thing about the movie is that it holds surprises - and it is not overblown.  It taps into the secret heart of many like Lester in search of his wasted  life back. He sees his daughter's friend (Mena Suvari) as the part of youth  remote from him; the love in Carolyn long lost to the American dream of  riches and glory and his daughter Thora Birch is alienated from him  altogether. The characters are dimensional - each has his story to tell -  the weird neighbour played by Wes Bentley despite his mental history is  ironically the most astute of all. His family is shattered by a disgraced  father and a silenced mother. The tragedy is heartfelt and poignant.Boosted by a haunting score and a screenplay from Alan Ball, Sam Mendes  injects this film with exquisite beauty. It is textured and invites the  audience to look closer into the deep psyche of the characters as well as a  hovering reflection of their own inner hearts. American Beauty evokes  innocence and an understated tone of maturity in the script. Despite all  its harsh ugliness inside, it is indubitably the most savagely tender and  beautiful film in recent times.",5,AMERICAN BEAUTY is not skin-deep,966211200,"08 14, 2000",2000,1801,"['Dysfunctional', 'family', 'ordeals', 'sinking', 'American', 'dream', 'ideal', 'life', 'constantly', 'appeared', 'films', 'Lee', 'Ang', 'THE', 'ICE', 'STORM', 'now', 'AMERICAN', 'BEAUTY', 'film', 'one', 'most', 'artistically', 'accomplished', 'silent', 'naunced', 'dissecting', 'character', 'peeling', 'petals', 'rose', 'Kevin', 'Spacey', 'unequivocally', 'scene-stealer', 'stealthy', 'emotions', 'deranged', 'husband', 'triumph', 'tender', 'father', 'expression', 'Annette', 'Benning', 'energized', 'money-grubbing', 'wife', 'Carolyn', 'who', 'disillusioned', 'pursue', 'money', 'Voyeurism', 'homosexuality', 'reflected', 'clear-cutting', 'honesty.The', 'exquisite', 'thing', 'movie', 'surprises', 'not', 'overblown', 'secret', 'heart', 'many', 'Lester', 'search', 'wasted', 'life', 'back', 'daughter', 'friend', 'Mena', 'Suvari', 'part', 'youth', 'remote', 'love', 'Carolyn', 'long', 'lost', 'American', 'dream', 'riches', 'glory', 'daughter', 'Thora', 'Birch', 'alienated', 'altogether', 'characters', 'are', 'dimensional', 'story', 'tell', 'weird', 'neighbour', 'played', 'Wes', 'Bentley', 'mental', 'history', 'ironically', 'most', 'astute', 'family', 'shattered', 'disgraced', 'father', 'silenced', 'mother', 'tragedy', 'heartfelt', 'poignant.Boosted', 'haunting', 'score', 'screenplay', 'Alan', 'Ball', 'Sam', 'Mendes', 'film', 'exquisite', 'beauty', 'textured', 'audience', 'look', 'closer', 'deep', 'psyche', 'characters', 'as', 'well', 'hovering', 'reflection', 'own', 'inner', 'hearts', 'American', 'Beauty', 'evokes', 'innocence', 'understated', 'tone', 'maturity', 'script', 'harsh', 'ugliness', 'indubitably', 'most', 'savagely', 'tender', 'beautiful', 'film', 'recent', 'times']",Belleza Americana American Beauty  VHS

Having seen a trailer for the film, I expected it to concentrate heavily on the character of Lester Burnham (Kevin Spacey). I suppose it does - Spacey, one of cinema's great actors, dominates the film. The relationships between the other main characters both add and detract from the success of the film. Particularly strong performances from Burnham's neighbours (British spelling!) - the ultimate disfunctional family headed by Colonel Frank Fitts US Marine Corps (as Chris Cooper regularly introduces himself), father to drug dealing son Ricky (Wes Bentley) and husband of sorts to depressed Barbara (Allison Janney). The Colonel despises gays, owns an original piece of Nazi cutlery and takes every opportunity to express his dominance. His son secretely videos the Burnham family home, especially Lester Burnham's teenage daughter Jane (Thora Burch). The pair eventually meet and gradually fall in love. I use the word gradually deliberately. Their relationship is one of the film's weaker points. Their subplot is ponderous and could have been dropped altogether without harming the film.  Meanwhile, Spacey's character transforms himself from a subserviant, meek door mouse, dominated by his extravert wife Carolyn (Annette Bening), into a carefree devil-may-care guy who quits his job, sells his sensible family car to buy a cool classic, the car of his dreams. The catalyst of this transformation is his daughter's friend Angela Hayes (Mena Survari), who he meets and immedialtely lusts over. When she returns his affection, Lester begins working out, turning his garage into a private gym, until he realises that they can never consumate their relationship.  American Beauty is a fun ride, mainly thanks to the charismatic Spacey. Lester Burnham does what many people would love to do - trade security for freedom before it's too late.

Their Daughter, her best friend and the Father and Son next door neighbor's put on a fabulous performance too.  It's funny, sad, disturbing, surprising and has quite a tragic ending.  It's like a roller coaster ride that keep's on going and going non stop.  It might not be a movie that will appeal to everyone, but if you're looking for a great movie that's a little different than the ordinary, check this one out.  I would definitely recommend it.

Johnson,"[0, 4]","This movie came up in conversation today and I remembered I had bought it because I really like Kevin Spacey and because it won Oscar for Best Picture. So I watched it and am really weirded out. This is a 1999 movie and when it was made, I would have been exactly Kevin Spacey's character's age. Having undergone one myself, I totally understand his midlife crisis and somehow, even his solution. The Burnhams are very real due to the acting talents of Spacey and Bening; however, the movie is unreal. Or is it the other way around? There are so many inter-connections and twists and turns, yet it's predictable at the same time. At least there are only 6 major characters to deal with: two married couples and two teens, the couples' children, no less.I'm giving this 3 stars because it's close, on the positive side, to 2 and 1/2 stars: totally midpoint since I am so muddled and ambivalent about this movie.",3,"""Huh?""",1247875200,"07 18, 2009",2009,910,"['movie', 'came', 'up', 'conversation', 'today', 'remembered', 'had', 'bought', 'really', 'Kevin', 'Spacey', 'won', 'Oscar', 'Best', 'Picture', 'So', 'watched', 'am', 'really', 'weirded', 'out', '1999', 'movie', 'when', 'was', 'made', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'exactly', 'Kevin', 'Spacey', 'character', 'age', 'Having', 'undergone', 'one', 'totally', 'understand', 'midlife', 'crisis', 'somehow', 'even', 'solution', 'Burnhams', 'are', 'very', 'real', 'due', 'acting', 'talents', 'Spacey', 'Bening', 'however', 'movie', 'unreal', 'other', 'way', 'are', 'so', 'many', 'inter-connections', 'twists', 'turns', 'predictable', 'same', 'time', 'least', 'are', 'only', '6', 'major', 'characters', 'deal', 'two', 'married', 'couples', 'two', 'teens', 'couples', 'children', 'less.I', ""'m"", 'giving', '3', 'stars', 'close', 'positive', 'side', '2', '1/2', 'stars', 'totally', 'midpoint', 'am', 'so', 'muddled', 'ambivalent', 'movie']",Belleza Americana American Beauty  VHS

Litton,"[16, 24]","Hollywood has always gone out of the way to portray life in the big city, or on the countryside, but the suburban lifestyle remained to be explored in greater detail. &quot;American Beauty,&quot; a script written by Alan Ball, would become the most praised film of 1999, exploring the ups and downs of suburbia through the eyes of one man. As boasted in the movie trailers, &quot;American Beauty&quot; proves that a comedy can be serious, and a drama can be humorous.The film contains a large cargo of controversial issues, from drug use and dysfunctional families to homosexuality and sexual relationships that span two different age groups. In a time period where so many people are too timid to discuss these issues it is refreshing to see that a movie which is widely available to the general public is carrying all of these issues among its lines of dialogue and sweeping camera shots. Director Sam Mendes keeps the movie going at its own unique pace, bringing the characters to life with a top-notch cast and a superb crew.Kevin Spacey is the ever-drab Lester Burnham, a typical suburban male who leads a monotonous, routine lifestyle with his domineering, real-estate wife Carolyn, and his emotionally-distanced daughter Jane. A typical day at work and a family dinner are among the many aspects of life shown through Lester's eyes. When Carolyn and Lester attend Jane's cheerleading performance at a school basketball game, Lester is suddenly thrown into a world of sexual fantasy when he lays eyes on his daughter's friend, Angela Hayes. This begins his descent/ascent, and is soon working out to build up his body for his new love and smoking joints he gets from his teenage next door neighbor. He quits his job, blackmails his old boss, and begins working as a short-order cook at a fast-food restaurant.This is perhaps one of the most controversial films ever. But, it is also one of the most hauntingly realistic and powerful movies that has ever moved audiences to feel such emotion for life and connection to the characters it portrays. Each scene has its own way of making us believe in the emotions that Lester is experiencing, and very soon, we are in his world, going through the life that he is living, sometimes laughing, sometimes crying, and sometimes bewildered by his actions. To be able to feel that deep a connection is the mark of a truly great film.Kevin Spacey makes the most unbelievable character in history, bringing such hilarity and laughter to the screen, while at the same time making sure the audience knows that his character is being totally serious and sincere in his actions, and not doing it for mere attention. Annette Bening is wonderful in her role as Carolyn, who is the strong yet very fragile wife of Lester. She has a wonderful knack for showing her emotion, whether it be happy or sad, at all times of filming. The teenage actors, Thora Birch, Mena Suvari and Wes Bentley, are superbly rendered here, making the teenage aspect of the story realistic and memorable.The film has a great deal to offer for all age groups who watch it. It deals with real-life issues in a reality-based setting, with characters who can easily parallel people in real life. It is no wonder that the film received the awards it did; it is a truly remarkable masterpiece that will be remembered by all for years to come.",5,"Beauty in every way, shape and form.",985910400,"03 30, 2001",2001,3347,"['Hollywood', 'always', 'gone', 'way', 'portray', 'life', 'big', 'city', 'countryside', 'suburban', 'lifestyle', 'remained', 'be', 'explored', 'greater', 'detail', 'quot', 'American', 'Beauty', 'quot', 'script', 'written', 'Alan', 'Ball', 'would', 'become', 'most', 'praised', 'film', '1999', 'exploring', 'ups', 'downs', 'suburbia', 'eyes', 'one', 'man', 'boasted', 'movie', 'trailers', 'quot', 'American', 'Beauty', 'quot', 'comedy', 'can', 'be', 'serious', 'drama', 'can', 'be', 'humorous.The', 'film', 'large', 'cargo', 'controversial', 'issues', 'drug', 'use', 'dysfunctional', 'families', 'homosexuality', 'sexual', 'relationships', 'span', 'two', 'different', 'age', 'groups', 'time', 'period', 'where', 'so', 'many', 'people', 'are', 'too', 'timid', 'discuss', 'issues', 'refreshing', 'see', 'movie', 'widely', 'available', 'general', 'public', 'carrying', 'issues', 'lines', 'dialogue', 'sweeping', 'camera', 'shots', 'Director', 'Sam', 'Mendes', 'movie', 'going', 'own', 'unique', 'pace', 'bringing', 'characters', 'life', 'top-notch', 'cast', 'superb', 'crew.Kevin', 'Spacey', 'ever-drab', 'Lester', 'Burnham', 'typical', 'suburban', 'male', 'who', 'monotonous', 'routine', 'lifestyle', 'domineering', 'real-estate', 'wife', 'Carolyn', 'emotionally-distanced', 'daughter', 'Jane', 'typical', 'day', 'work', 'family', 'dinner', 'are', 'many', 'aspects', 'life', 'shown', 'Lester', 'eyes', 'When', 'Carolyn', 'Lester', 'attend', 'Jane', 'cheerleading', 'performance', 'school', 'basketball', 'game', 'Lester', 'suddenly', 'thrown', 'world', 'sexual', 'fantasy', 'when', 'eyes', 'daughter', 'friend', 'Angela', 'Hayes', 'descent/ascent', 'soon', 'working', 'out', 'build', 'up', 'body', 'new', 'love', 'smoking', 'joints', 'teenage', 'next', 'door', 'neighbor', 'job', 'old', 'boss', 'working', 'short-order', 'cook', 'fast-food', 'restaurant.This', 'perhaps', 'one', 'most', 'controversial', 'films', 'ever', 'also', 'one', 'most', 'hauntingly', 'realistic', 'powerful', 'movies', 'ever', 'moved', 'audiences', 'feel', 'such', 'emotion', 'life', 'connection', 'characters', 'scene', 'own', 'way', 'making', 'believe', 'emotions', 'Lester', 'experiencing', 'very', 'soon', 'are', 'world', 'going', 'life', 'living', 'sometimes', 'laughing', 'sometimes', 'crying', 'sometimes', 'bewildered', 'actions', 'be', 'able', 'feel', 'connection', 'mark', 'truly', 'great', 'film.Kevin', 'Spacey', 'most', 'unbelievable', 'character', 'history', 'bringing', 'such', 'hilarity', 'laughter', 'screen', 'same', 'time', 'making', 'sure', 'audience', 'character', 'being', 'totally', 'serious', 'sincere', 'actions', 'not', 'doing', 'mere', 'attention', 'Annette', 'Bening', 'wonderful', 'role', 'Carolyn', 'who', 'strong', 'yet', 'very', 'fragile', 'wife', 'Lester', 'wonderful', 'knack', 'showing', 'emotion', 'be', 'happy', 'sad', 'times', 'filming', 'teenage', 'actors', 'Thora', 'Birch', 'Mena', 'Suvari', 'Wes', 'Bentley', 'are', 'superbly', 'rendered', 'here', 'making', 'teenage', 'aspect', 'story', 'realistic', 'memorable.The', 'film', 'great', 'deal', 'offer', 'age', 'groups', 'who', 'watch', 'real-life', 'issues', 'reality-based', 'setting', 'characters', 'who', 'can', 'easily', 'parallel', 'people', 'real', 'life', 'wonder', 'film', 'received', 'awards', 'did', 'truly', 'remarkable', 'masterpiece', 'will', 'be', 'remembered', 'years', 'come']",Belleza Americana American Beauty  VHS

Mok,"[0, 0]","By the end of American Beauty, I knew that in whatever evaluations I might  articulate about the film, this was one case where I can't pretend to have  any kind of objectivity.The emotional impact of this film on me was so  great that I felt personally affected, a rarity when I watch a film these  days.  No character of any weight is neglected in this film, each with a  carefully considered arc and deep-welled needs and desires that make you  care.  Kevin Spacey as Lester Burnham brings to life the complex  psychosexual dilemmas of the character effortlessly, with his trademark  offbeat charisma and wit; Wes Bentley, with his penetrating stare and  sensitive characterization, brings a tenderness and nuance to the  oddball-kid-next-door role of Ricky Fitts; Thora Birch projects deep  maturity as Jane, clarifying every internal change her character goes  through as she starts becoming drawn to Ricky to leave her family behind;  Mena Suvari joins the ranks of Katie Holmes and Sarah Polley as a young  actress to watch for, injecting remarkably depth and absolute honesty to  the role of Angela; even an antagonist like Col. Fitts is filled by an  excellent portrayal in Chris Cooper's performance, a wrenching mix of  hardened hatreds and shattering vulnerability.  The only character that was  questionable to me was Annette Bening's, where I actually feel like  Carolyn's private moments (where we're supposed to be able to poke through  her mask) are also not believable.  However, given so many other moving  moments, points of delicious humour, and visually gorgeous cinematography,  I didn't really care.  And aesthetically this is a feast for the senses:  Conrad L. Hall's acclaimed cinematography both makes the actors and scenery  look good and help probe into the life within them, and Thomas Newman's  score is perfect, as light-fingered as director Sam Mendes' staging and  tone, as delicate as the performances, as witty and suggestive as Alan  Ball's multi-layered, richly evocative script, and as beautiful as the  visuals.This film soared to the top of my best-of lists right after I  saw it, ranking alongside diverse favourites I've seen over the years  including GoodFellas, The Killer, Manon of the Spring, Fun, and Kagemusha:  The Shadow Warrior.  American Beauty is every bit their equal in terms of  visual sophistication, performances and craft, while surpassing them all in  its quest for emotional catharsis and engagement.",5,"Emotionally sublime, flawless filmmaking and acting.",959817600,"06 1, 2000",2000,2461,"['end', 'American', 'Beauty', 'knew', 'evaluations', 'might', 'articulate', 'film', 'was', 'one', 'case', 'where', 'ca', ""n't"", 'pretend', 'have', 'kind', 'objectivity.The', 'emotional', 'impact', 'film', 'was', 'so', 'great', 'felt', 'personally', 'affected', 'rarity', 'when', 'watch', 'film', 'days', 'character', 'weight', 'neglected', 'film', 'carefully', 'considered', 'arc', 'deep-welled', 'needs', 'make', 'care', 'Kevin', 'Spacey', 'Lester', 'Burnham', 'life', 'complex', 'psychosexual', 'dilemmas', 'character', 'effortlessly', 'trademark', 'offbeat', 'charisma', 'wit', 'Wes', 'Bentley', 'penetrating', 'stare', 'sensitive', 'characterization', 'tenderness', 'nuance', 'oddball-kid-next-door', 'role', 'Ricky', 'Fitts', 'Thora', 'Birch', 'projects', 'deep', 'maturity', 'Jane', 'clarifying', 'internal', 'change', 'character', 'becoming', 'drawn', 'Ricky', 'leave', 'family', 'Mena', 'Suvari', 'ranks', 'Katie', 'Holmes', 'Sarah', 'Polley', 'young', 'actress', 'watch', 'injecting', 'remarkably', 'depth', 'absolute', 'honesty', 'role', 'Angela', 'even', 'antagonist', 'Col.', 'Fitts', 'filled', 'excellent', 'portrayal', 'Chris', 'Cooper', 'performance', 'wrenching', 'mix', 'hardened', 'hatreds', 'shattering', 'vulnerability', 'only', 'character', 'was', 'questionable', 'was', 'Annette', 'Bening', 'where', 'actually', 'feel', 'Carolyn', 'private', 'moments', 'where', ""'re"", 'supposed', 'be', 'able', 'poke', 'mask', 'are', 'also', 'not', 'believable', 'However', 'given', 'so', 'many', 'other', 'moving', 'moments', 'points', 'delicious', 'humour', 'visually', 'gorgeous', 'cinematography', 'did', ""n't"", 'really', 'care', 'aesthetically', 'feast', 'senses', 'Conrad', 'L.', 'Hall', 'acclaimed', 'cinematography', 'actors', 'scenery', 'look', 'good', 'help', 'probe', 'life', 'Thomas', 'Newman', 'score', 'perfect', 'as', 'light-fingered', 'director', 'Sam', 'Mendes', 'staging', 'tone', 'as', 'delicate', 'performances', 'witty', 'suggestive', 'Alan', 'Ball', 'multi-layered', 'richly', 'evocative', 'script', 'as', 'beautiful', 'visuals.This', 'film', 'soared', 'top', 'best-of', 'lists', 'right', 'saw', 'ranking', 'alongside', 'diverse', 'favourites', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'years', 'including', 'GoodFellas', 'Killer', 'Manon', 'Spring', 'Fun', 'Kagemusha', 'Shadow', 'Warrior', 'American', 'Beauty', 'bit', 'equal', 'terms', 'visual', 'sophistication', 'performances', 'craft', 'surpassing', 'quest', 'emotional', 'catharsis', 'engagement']",Belleza Americana American Beauty  VHS

When I first saw it in the theatre, I had no idea what to expect.  To my surprise and delight, I found a truly deep and stimulating film;  something that is almost bereft in Hollywood productions these days.The movie centers around the life of one Lester Burnham, played by Kevin Spacey.  This is a different sort of role for the usual masculine Spacey, and he turns in an Academy Award calibre performance.  The story details the plight of Burnham as he approaches middle age and the dreaded &quot;mid-life crisis.&quot;  His marriage no longer holds any passion, his daughter feels nothing but apathy towards him, and his employer feels that he must write up a report to &quot;justify his existence&quot; as the company he works for is ready to downsize (if that's not a buzzword these days for corporations, I don't know what is).There is a haunting nostalgia and foreboding which saturates this movie as few I've ever seen.  Burnham's meditation on his own death is utterly fascinating.  The tale distinctively brings to mind the passage &quot;Death By Water&quot; from T.S. Eliot's &quot;The Wasteland&quot;:Phlebas the Phoenician, a fortnight dead,Forgot the cry of gulls, and the deep sea swell And the profit and loss.A current under seaPicked his bones in whispers.  As he rose and fellHe passed the stages of his age and youthEntering the whirlpool.Gentile or JewO you who turn the wheel and look to windward,Consider Phlebas, who was once handsome and tall asyou.  (312-322)Through all this, Spacey's character dreams of reclaiming lost youth &amp; the vigour for life that he once held.  There are also Faulkneresque overtones straight out of &quot;The Sound And The Fury&quot; as Burnham's daughter &amp; her boyfriend confront the awakening of their sexuality and the concept of death simultaneously.This is a tremendous effort of film-making, and I just wish Hollywood would take more chances on cerebral projects such as this one, instead of sticking to the safe, redundant &quot;tried &amp; true&quot; formulae movies for which they are so well known.

67553,A5WN8L3I2CDV5,0783239408,D. Rotmil,"[18, 22]","It's one thing to not like a film such as ""American Beauty"" because you enjoy more car chases and more explosions. It's quite another to deem a film as a pile of poo when clouded by one's own personal views of ""morality"". It tends to blind sight a film viewer from understanding the actual ""moral"" of the story.  Despite some glaringly misguided and erroneous perceptions of ""American Beauty"" by some on this site, this film is a masterpiece in performance, cinematography and screenwriting.  The storyline has been well documented here, so I will delve into other concepts this film.  (Warning: Spoilers)Lester Burnham said that he ""felt like he was in a coma for the last 20 years and just woke up"" after laying eyes on the luscious Angela Hayes.  In fact, he awoke into another dream, dwelling in fantasies, reliving a rebellious youth, quitting his job, smoking joints and pumping iron as his fantasies of the rose pedaled Angela drives him. (And don't count out the meaning of those roses - they turn up everywhere).  When he faces the realization of his fantasy by starting his seduction, he discovers that the dirty, naughty Angela is a frightened child, no different than his own Jane.  He has now - finally - awoken from that coma.  Just as he begins to conceive his blessings, tragedy steals them from him.  In death, he sees the truth in his life:  his lovely daughter Jane, his wonderful house and the memory of his carefree, happy wife laughing on an amusement park ride. In two gunshots Lester drifts in an afterlife limbo - viewing the world in which he once lived as the most sensuous, beauty he ever set eyes on.  Just like Ricky Fitts (the only character who relished beauty in the world with a poetic longing) sees it in a plastic bag, dancing with the wind.""American Beauty"" is not a film about homosexuality.  It is not a movie about morals. It is not a film about stereotyping military men, nor is it about pedophilia. This film is a look into the concept of the American Dream, and how it might not be what it seems. We fall into ruts. We have mid-life crises. Husbands and wives move in other directions and find contempt for each other. Teenagers can be moody and hate their parents, because 1) they are too self absorbed to notice them, or 2) they don't know how to communicate with them. People step out of bounds to move up in a career. Beauty queens are hiding more innocence than one would suspect. Some others live in a hypocritical world, hiding what they are, staying tightly wound, perceiving others to be what they are not, and spewing hatred over things that aren't true. In a nutshell, everyone in this movie is trying to be something they are not.  In doing so, they are missing out on the blessings on what they already have, and the humans they are meant to be.What stuck me most about ""American Beauty"" is not only the story we're experiencing on screen, but the story we won't see:  the aftermath of Lester Burnham's demise.  Who will be blamed for Lester's death?  Will Carolyn?  Ricky? Jane? Frank Fitts? What about Carolyn and the devastation over the loss of the husband whom she let slip through her fingers in moments of anger, neglect and put downs?  What wreckage will be left in this family?  How will they live with the memory of having given such careless thought to the life they once had and will never have again?The Oscars this film has garnered speaks for itself.  So, before one gripes about homosexual stereotypes and morality in this film, think about what you are not seeing. Put aside your political agenda, and look beyond what you find ugly or wrong and render the universal meaning of this film.

This famous Henry David Thoreau quote is often cited but nowhere is it more apt than in the life of Lester Burnham. The life of dreary feigned cheerfulness that he lives in suburban America bores him to tears, but that is all blown out of his mind by the arrival of the young pretty nymphet Angela Hayes.With clear parallels to Vladimir Nabokov's 'Lolita' this movie is as much a feast for the mind as it is a cinematographic feast for the eye. The red rose petals bursting forth so often being a striking representation of the rebirth of Lester's life after so many years in monotonous solitude and also of the budding beauty of youth that Angela makes her own.What makes 'American Beauty' so encapsulating is the anger that is always on the verge of bursting out of the characters. Lester is stepped on and belittled by his family which fuels a fury that is boiling beneath his calm exterior. Angela is a release for Lester, both from the mind numbing boredom he suffers, and the sexual frustration that his wife forces on him. Make no mistake it is not love or anything like it that pulls him towards her, it is nothing but a combination of boredom and pure animal lust.'American Beauty' is a remarkable film that has left it's mark on the cinema world and beyond. It's dark depiction of middle class suburbia has spawned a line of similar creations such as 'The Stepford Wives' and T.V. show 'Desperate Housewives'. But no matter how many movies or T.V. shows come in it's wake, it is doubtful that any of them will match the dark, bizzare fascinating nature of this classic.",5,"""You have no idea what I'm talking about I'm sure, but don't worry, you will someday""",1127520000,"09 24, 2005",2005,1623,"['Most', 'men', 'lead', 'lives', 'quiet', 'desperation', 'famous', 'Henry', 'David', 'Thoreau', 'quote', 'often', 'cited', 'nowhere', 'more', 'apt', 'life', 'Lester', 'Burnham', 'life', 'dreary', 'feigned', 'cheerfulness', 'suburban', 'America', 'tears', 'blown', 'mind', 'arrival', 'young', 'pretty', 'nymphet', 'Angela', 'Hayes.With', 'clear', 'parallels', 'Vladimir', 'Nabokov', ""'Lolita"", 'movie', 'as', 'much', 'feast', 'mind', 'cinematographic', 'feast', 'eye', 'red', 'rose', 'petals', 'bursting', 'forth', 'so', 'often', 'being', 'striking', 'representation', 'rebirth', 'Lester', 'life', 'so', 'many', 'years', 'monotonous', 'solitude', 'also', 'budding', 'beauty', 'youth', 'Angela', 'own.What', ""'American"", 'Beauty', 'so', 'encapsulating', 'anger', 'always', 'verge', 'bursting', 'characters', 'Lester', 'stepped', 'belittled', 'family', 'fury', 'boiling', 'calm', 'exterior', 'Angela', 'release', 'Lester', 'mind', 'numbing', 'boredom', 'sexual', 'frustration', 'wife', 'forces', 'Make', 'mistake', 'not', 'love', 'anything', 'nothing', 'combination', 'boredom', 'pure', 'animal', 'lust', ""'American"", 'Beauty', 'remarkable', 'film', 'left', 'mark', 'cinema', 'world', 'dark', 'depiction', 'middle', 'class', 'suburbia', 'spawned', 'line', 'similar', 'creations', 'such', ""'The"", 'Stepford', 'Wives', 'T.V', 'show', ""'Desperate"", 'Housewives', 'matter', 'how', 'many', 'movies', 'T.V', 'come', 'wake', 'doubtful', 'will', 'match', 'dark', 'bizzare', 'fascinating', 'nature', 'classic']",Belleza Americana American Beauty  VHS

The movie is interesting and unusual, but I couldn't help the feeling that it was too much ,too soon for people like us. As youngsters, far away of marriage problems, the occurrences has made us feel uneasy and upset us.It's like we'd got an opportunity to take a glance at the future to come, only to become quite confused... I should stress that the film doesn't deal only with marriage,  there are more subjects on the agenda. Still, the main criteria is the familiy and the turmoils it goes through in our age - the materialistic,lonely,alienated,stressing age.It's a heavy film, burdensome and saddening. There are some moments of laughter , but the atmosphere is clearly the above. A memorable scene comes in the end, when a whole new outlook over death is presented, to my opinion the brightest ,but then again, the saddest moment in the film.To end with, I think that young folks shouldn't watch it, it will only confuse them as it confused me .

67569,A3GPFHWJ1SSIHE,0783239408,Eric B. Norris,"[3, 8]","There has been a lot of hype written about this movie, and a lot of misunderstanding.  THIS FILM IS NOT A COMEDY.  It is not about  suburbia.  What it is about is the landscape of human passion.Lester Burnham (Kevin Spacey) is &quot;already dead&quot; and he knows it.  Then one day he meets the 17-year-old friend of his daughter, and Lester Burnham begins to wake up.  Lester is stunned by the young woman (Mena Suvari), and lusts after her.  This is the first of many points in the movie that are misleading if taken too literally.  This movie is not about a middle-aged man lusting after a 17-year old girl, it is about a middle-aged man reconnecting with the passion he once felt.  Suvari's character is the stalking horse for Lester's passion.  Lester reconnects with his own passion for life by first feeling this sexual desire for a girl who is forbidden to him.  But it doesn't end there.  Eventually Lester develops, or redevelops, into a man filled with passion and love, and an almost Zen-like desire to see others fulfilled.  Later in the film when Lester confronts his wife Caroline (Annette Bening) in a situation where Lester has been wronged and could really be angry with her, he says, &quot;it's ok, Caroline, I want you to be happy.&quot;  In the end, Lester comes full circle and even the situation with Suvari's character changes.American Beauty is chock full of excellent performances by the cast.  There is a lot to this movie, and it lends itself well to multiple viewings on DVD.  I've seen American Beauty three times in the theater and countless times on DVD--I still get something new out of each viewing.  The DVD itself has a moderate number of extras (the Awards Edition), more than you'd find on a regular DVD, but not as many as say the Fight Club DVD which could only be described as loaded.  The only thing I found a bit irritating was that the movie was already a success by the time some of the DVD extras got added.  This slightly changes the perspective of the people involved.

67573,A1FMJJKSVQDDQ,0783239408,Eric S. Kim,"[1, 1]","When people say that this is the best movie of 1999, they are absolutely correct. This is a touching, sometimes funny, and sometimes heartbreaking film from Sam Mendes. It takes a look at the dark sides (as well as the fun sides) of suburban America. The film doesn't condemn this specific lifestyle, but it doesn't pay tribute to it, either. It's an examination on many of its unique aspects. Kevin Spacey's character Lester is at the heart of the story: here is a man who can't stand his job and is inspired (by his daughter's best friend) to regain his youth. This may be an unoriginal plot (and some of the characters), but it's the way it's executed that makes it so effective. The realism surrounding Lester and his family is almost to a T. Carolyn, his wife, is almost unlikable because of her materialistic fixations. But then again, Annette Bening gives a completely compelling performance. The younger actors (Birch as Jane, Bentley as Ricky, and Suvari as Angela) also give fine performances. Chris Cooper almost steals the show as the supposedly homophobic military man.Filled with impressive imagery, clever symbolism, and a memorable music score from Thomas Newman, I'd say that American Beauty is indeed the best film of 1999. It deserved all the awards it received. It's an American classic, and I think it's going to become one of my favorite films in the future.Grade: 9.5 out of 10",5,Tales of American Suburbia,1380067200,"09 25, 2013",2013,1400,"['When', 'people', 'say', 'best', 'movie', '1999', 'are', 'absolutely', 'correct', 'touching', 'sometimes', 'funny', 'sometimes', 'heartbreaking', 'film', 'Sam', 'Mendes', 'look', 'dark', 'sides', 'as', 'well', 'fun', 'sides', 'suburban', 'America', 'film', ""n't"", 'condemn', 'specific', 'lifestyle', ""n't"", 'pay', 'tribute', 'either', 'examination', 'many', 'unique', 'aspects', 'Kevin', 'Spacey', 'character', 'Lester', 'heart', 'story', 'here', 'man', 'who', 'ca', ""n't"", 'stand', 'job', 'inspired', 'daughter', 'best', 'friend', 'regain', 'youth', 'may', 'be', 'unoriginal', 'plot', 'characters', 'way', 'executed', 'so', 'effective', 'realism', 'surrounding', 'Lester', 'family', 'almost', 'T.', 'Carolyn', 'wife', 'almost', 'unlikable', 'materialistic', 'fixations', 'then', 'again', 'Annette', 'Bening', 'completely', 'compelling', 'performance', 'younger', 'actors', 'Birch', 'Jane', 'Bentley', 'Ricky', 'Suvari', 'Angela', 'also', 'give', 'fine', 'performances', 'Chris', 'Cooper', 'almost', 'show', 'supposedly', 'homophobic', 'military', 'man.Filled', 'impressive', 'imagery', 'clever', 'symbolism', 'memorable', 'music', 'score', 'Thomas', 'Newman', ""'d"", 'say', 'American', 'Beauty', 'indeed', 'best', 'film', '1999', 'deserved', 'awards', 'received', 'American', 'classic', 'think', 'going', 'become', 'one', 'favorite', 'films', 'future.Grade', '9.5', '10']",Belleza Americana American Beauty  VHS

67575,A2LO5XLG3G50PL,0783239408,Eric Swanger,"[0, 5]","There are some moments in time where you begin to ackowledge the fragility of life.  Sometimes it comes in the shape of a personal experience, or you might witness it through someone else's lives around you.  Or in this circumstance, a lesson may also become revealed in a piece of art.  I must admit that when I went to see &quot;American Beauty&quot; upon release in the theatres, I knew that I was going to see a film that was really groundbreaking.  I heard all the buzz on TV, read about it online and in the papers, but considering I am a world-class skeptic-I had to see the evidence for myself.Well, I was totally astounded.  I think that &quot;American Beauty&quot; is a deeply moving film on so many levels.  At its core, I suppose it is a film about redemption, or possibly self-redemption.  But there are so many other issues that the film brings to the surface:Distant family relationships, teenage maladgustment and alienation, love versus sex, vanity versus true happiness, amung many others.  And the true strength of the film is that these issues are brought up in a very honest eloquence, mainly due to a terrific assemblage of characters by Alan Ball and a really fantastic cast of actors.  Each character is very different on the surface, but upon examination, they are all struggling with very similar issues of identity, some fairing better than others.  Another great thing about the script is that each character is given the opportunity to really confront their problems, and we get to see how their decisions tend to bleed into the lives of those around them.  Its not difficult to identify with these people, because their situations are so common in all our lives.  But I think that it isnt often that a film can capture so many truly moving moments, however hilarious, heartbreaking, or disturbing all at once.The movie also has a lot of style.  There are many repetitious uses of symbols and irony, gorgeous cinematography, a deeply moving and complimentary score by Thomas Newman, and a real sense of tension through editing and environments.  I cant think of a movie in the past decade that really succeeds at defining it's own &quot;look&quot; as AB does.  There are slow motion shots, weird camera angles, strange uses of color, but all integral in the quest to push the film's agenda.  There are a lot of moments in &quot;American Beauty&quot; that really transcend what is being offered in modern moviemaking.  It is a very concise, quiet, funny, sad and monumental film all at the same time.  It is terribly entertaining on one hand and heartbreaking the next.  And in my opinion, it deserves all the attention it received, even just for having the audacity to bring up the issues that it did.  But to do it with the sensitivity and elegance that it accomplished is truly extraordinary.The DVD is really great.  The behind the scenes part on the menu is mediocre, but i really enjoyed watching the movie with the commentary by Sam Mendes and Alan Ball.  They really communicate what it entailed to bring the script to life, technically and artistically.

Am I  missing something?  Aren't we all, in some way, functioning outside the  parameters of our factory specs?  Or are &quot;things,&quot; such as $4000  sofas and illicit relationships, what our Designer had in mind for us to  pursue?This movie, through brilliant and understated acting, takes us  into the lives of people who are dealing with these questions in  drastically different ways.  The film's haunting, slow-paced honesty sits  down beside you and casually drapes an arm over your shoulder.

Result: the movie is being acclaimed by American and international press and, due to its favoritism (American Beauty is the winner of three Golden Globes: best screenplay, director and picture). And it is just Sam Mendes' first film.""American Beauty"" is one of those unusual motion pictures, that eventually arises to show that the industry of American cinema is not restricted to commercial productions to be consumed by the public, without any sense of criticism. It is a light narrative, which constantly sways between comedy and drama, starring Kevin Spacey and Annette Bening, that concerns the appearances of our lives, based on the relationship of a suburban and contemporary American family. What the movie try to and does demonstrate is that, in fact, nothing is what appears to be. (that is why the movie tagline ""... look closer"" makes sense) In ""American Beauty"", almost all the characters pretend or seem to be what they really don't are. All except Lester Burnham, the character performed by Kevin Spacey, who, with nothing to lose, do vanish all appearances, starting to behave like a teenager, as a try to escape from the familiar coma. Slowly, this brilliant story discard the apparent American beauty. There is no more American way of life, there is just life. And the beauty can be found in the most ordinary things of life. We just need to look closer. And this is the essence of the movie, this is what makes it special, an excellent American film, with excellent screenplay, direction and performances.Hollywood makes history with ""American Beauty"", marking a time of turning its attention to more mature and better written scripts.

Spacey is brilliant as the advertising executive burnout that transforms the great idea into a collective masterpiece of interweaving performances. Lester Burnhamn, and his equally burned-out, nervous-wreck, wheeling-dealing, real estate saleswoman Bening, is looking for what he lost in high school, while she is figuring out why she is a lousy salewoman. And Spacey finds it in the drug dealer kid next door (whose Marine father happens to be a closet homosexual of all things) and the GIRL - Mena Suvari.Mena Suvari, despite her constant prouncements she's a sex queen, gets the hots for Spacey after he got the hots for her at the basketball game (?)--I was too busy watching Spacey ogle the Girl to notice where they were at.

Bening, not sure why they are married, meets the Real Estate King (Peter Gallagher) and finds her own sexual adventure into forbidden territory. Their repressed daughter then falls in love with the drug dealer of all ironies. Dysfunctional family. You think?If you're a guy and want to relive wanting the high school cheerleader of your dreams, and if you're a woman wanting to understand why a guy (or your husband) wants to relive wanting the high school cheerleader of his dreams, this is for you. At any rate, pure art bleeds from this film by Dreamworks. It is one of the top ten of all time.All in all, Spacey gives yet another knock-out performance (his best in my opinion) and the ensemble cast is deliriously funny and seriously deft and decidely--human. A don't miss! [...]P.S - Criticisms of the sexual nature of the film are really ridiculous since it is a taboo and does happen in the minds of all men.

67586,A3CWH6VKCTJAD,0783239408,"""flickjunkie""","[5, 7]","I was eager to see this once available on rental because I was wondering what all the fuss was about.  After having seen it, I'm still wondering.  At the risk of inducing a lot of indignant e-mail, I have to say that I  didn't think this film was all that great.  As a matter of fact, it was  only somewhere between okay and good.Admittedly, it was an effective  lampoon of American culture, with the clear message that life is ironic and  we need to get our priorities straight.  But it was far from a defining  moment in cinematic history, as has been implied in all the hype.  The fact  that it is being referred to as one of the greatest movies of all time  sends me an even more frightening message about American culture than the  film itself.The film had a sardonic tone and a wry style, most certainly  by design, but it was taken to excess to the point of being bizarre and  cartoonish.  The humor was sophomoric, the characters were more like  caricatures than people, and everything in the film was dreadfully clich&eacute;.  The story gets high marks for irreverence, but not for realism or  subtlety.The direction by Sam Mendes, other than that of the actors, was  really nothing special.  Other than a few vista shots, some rose petal  shots and the dancing paper bag, it was visually pretty mundane.  It was  also structurally unsound as a first person narrative.  The narrative  format is from the speaker's perspective and implicitly must limit itself  to events the speaker experienced directly or of which he had indirect  knowledge.  The film included numerous scenes and conversations of which  Lester could not possibly have had any knowledge by the end of the film.  That's just sloppy storytelling.The one area where this film shines is  the acting.  Though I don't agree with the character interpretations, the  character presentations were superb.  Kevin Spacey was fantastic as Lester.  He got better as the movie progressed as he was allowed to break out of  his caricature.  Annette Benning was not allowed that luxury, but played  the fanatical yuppie role to the hilt.  Thora Birch as daughter Jane had  the good fortune of playing the only realistic character in the entire  movie.  She was quite impressive, playing the part with a sensitivity and  poise belying her experience as an actress.This was a decent film, no  more, no less.  There were so many excellent films in 1999, that it is hard  for me to understand this film's mass appeal.  Perhaps we have become so  overwrought as a society that this film struck a chord.

67589,A2BPDFR58H9575,0783239408,Galina,"[8, 10]","American Beauty is a ""love it"" or ""hate it"" film, and you never know if it has more 'love it' or 'hate it' viewers. Personally, I love it -from the first sight, from the last sight, from the eternal sight. It is my favorite film of the 90s, one of my personal twenty favorites ever. I think that American Beauty is an instant classic, and it will stay that way as long as people watch movies.The film is deep, dark, and tragic. The title is American Beauty but it is more like Universal Sadness. It is not about superheroes - it is about very flawed, tired, and shallow people - but just as the tag line says - one must look closer.I live in a town like the one in American Beauty too - nice houses, brick, vinyl, neatly cut grass and flowers. ""The air is fresh and sweet like a child's kiss"". I jog in the mornings or in the evenings and people often sit on their porches or water their lawns or jog just as I do. We always smile at each other and say ""Hi, how are you?"" I always think to myself - what goes on beyond the closed doors of these people that I see? They could be happy with their families and with their jobs. They do look happy. Or, they may be tired and disappointed with their lives, trying to do something to change it - or just letting the days pass by.Leo Tolstoy opened his novel Anna Karenina with the words, ""All happy families are happy in the same way; each unhappy family is unique in its unhappiness"". That's why it is much more interesting for me to try and understand each unhappy family - why did it happen? The family in American Beauty used to be happy - there is even proof - the photograph with three of them, happy, laughing. Where did it go? When? Why? When was the moment in time when two loving people became strangers and prisoners in their own nice house with the beautiful roses outside? These are the questions I kept thinking about when I saw AB for the first time, and I still can not find the answers. Can something be changed? How? What do you do to wake up from the lethargic dream that your life has become? How do you reach the people who are the closest to you? What the hell do you need a $3000 couch for if you can not make love to your wife on it? What is the purpose of material possessions if they become more important than the smile of your daughter? When did you start to think that giving your children the best toys possible would substitute for a talk, for a sincere and honest interest as to what they really worry about? I did not find American Beauty patronizing and simplistic - it asks difficult questions but does not provide you with any easy answers. I still look for those answers. I don't blame the movie for imperfection of its characters - I know they do exist. We don't like them - but can one be mad when looking in the mirror? I want to add a couple of words about Spacey's character, Lester Burnham (BTW, Spacey may stop acting right now, and he probably should after all the flops he has produced since AB, but he will always be remembered for Lester). Lester could say about himself what another flawed but unforgettable character did 25 years before him: ""Well, I tried, didn't I? Goddamnit, at least I did that."" Lester Burnham died a happy man; the last words he heard in his life were that his daughter was in love - it meant for him that she could feel, that she was alive because love changes us and makes us better. His last sight was that of a picture where happiness and joy were captured forever. In death, he had at last captured that for which he had longed for the most in life - happiness.He died a happy man - not many do.",5,My Favorite Film From the 90s,1152576000,"07 11, 2006",2006,3617,"['American', 'Beauty', 'love', 'hate', 'film', 'never', 'know', 'more', ""'hate"", 'viewers', 'Personally', 'love', 'first', 'sight', 'last', 'sight', 'eternal', 'sight', 'favorite', 'film', '90s', 'one', 'personal', 'twenty', 'ever', 'think', 'American', 'Beauty', 'instant', 'classic', 'will', 'stay', 'way', 'as', 'long', 'people', 'watch', 'movies.The', 'film', 'deep', 'dark', 'tragic', 'title', 'American', 'Beauty', 'more', 'Universal', 'Sadness', 'not', 'superheroes', 'very', 'flawed', 'tired', 'shallow', 'people', 'just', 'tag', 'line', 'one', 'must', 'look', 'closer.I', 'live', 'town', 'one', 'American', 'Beauty', 'too', 'nice', 'houses', 'brick', 'vinyl', 'neatly', 'cut', 'grass', 'flowers', 'air', 'fresh', 'sweet', 'child', 'kiss', 'jog', 'mornings', 'evenings', 'people', 'often', 'sit', 'porches', 'water', 'lawns', 'jog', 'just', 'do', 'always', 'smile', 'other', 'say', 'Hi', 'how', 'are', 'always', 'think', 'myself', 'what', 'closed', 'doors', 'people', 'see', 'could', 'be', 'happy', 'families', 'jobs', 'do', 'look', 'happy', 'may', 'be', 'tired', 'disappointed', 'lives', 'trying', 'do', 'something', 'change', 'just', 'letting', 'days', 'pass', 'by.Leo', 'Tolstoy', 'opened', 'novel', 'Anna', 'Karenina', 'words', 'happy', 'families', 'are', 'happy', 'same', 'way', 'unhappy', 'family', 'unique', 'unhappiness', 'why', 'much', 'more', 'interesting', 'try', 'understand', 'unhappy', 'family', 'why', 'did', 'happen', 'family', 'American', 'Beauty', 'used', 'be', 'happy', 'even', 'proof', 'photograph', 'three', 'happy', 'laughing', 'Where', 'did', 'go', 'When', 'Why', 'When', 'was', 'moment', 'time', 'when', 'two', 'loving', 'people', 'became', 'strangers', 'prisoners', 'own', 'nice', 'house', 'beautiful', 'roses', 'are', 'questions', 'kept', 'thinking', 'when', 'saw', 'AB', 'first', 'time', 'still', 'can', 'not', 'find', 'answers', 'Can', 'something', 'be', 'changed', 'How', 'What', 'do', 'do', 'wake', 'up', 'lethargic', 'dream', 'life', 'become', 'How', 'do', 'reach', 'people', 'who', 'are', 'closest', 'What', 'hell', 'do', 'need', '3000', 'couch', 'can', 'not', 'make', 'love', 'wife', 'What', 'purpose', 'material', 'possessions', 'become', 'more', 'important', 'smile', 'daughter', 'When', 'did', 'start', 'think', 'giving', 'children', 'best', 'toys', 'possible', 'would', 'substitute', 'talk', 'sincere', 'honest', 'interest', 'what', 'really', 'worry', 'did', 'not', 'find', 'American', 'Beauty', 'patronizing', 'simplistic', 'difficult', 'questions', 'not', 'provide', 'easy', 'answers', 'still', 'look', 'answers', 'do', ""n't"", 'blame', 'movie', 'imperfection', 'characters', 'know', 'do', 'exist', 'do', ""n't"", 'like', 'can', 'one', 'be', 'mad', 'when', 'looking', 'mirror', 'want', 'add', 'couple', 'words', 'Spacey', 'character', 'Lester', 'Burnham', 'BTW', 'Spacey', 'may', 'stop', 'acting', 'right', 'now', 'probably', 'should', 'flops', 'produced', 'AB', 'will', 'always', 'be', 'remembered', 'Lester', 'Lester', 'could', 'say', 'what', 'flawed', 'unforgettable', 'character', 'did', '25', 'years', 'Well', 'tried', 'did', ""n't"", 'Goddamnit', 'least', 'did', 'Lester', 'Burnham', 'died', 'happy', 'man', 'last', 'words', 'heard', 'life', 'were', 'daughter', 'was', 'love', 'meant', 'could', 'feel', 'was', 'alive', 'love', 'changes', 'better', 'last', 'sight', 'was', 'picture', 'where', 'happiness', 'joy', 'were', 'captured', 'forever', 'death', 'had', 'last', 'captured', 'had', 'longed', 'most', 'life', 'happiness.He', 'died', 'happy', 'man', 'not', 'many', 'do']",Belleza Americana American Beauty  VHS
67590,ACIBQ6BQ6AWEV,0783239408,"Gary F. Taylor ""GFT""","[15, 19]","The Burnhams are a typical, upwardly mobile family: a father with a well-paid job in advertising, a mother who is a driven real estate sales agent, an angst-ridden teen age daughter who is at an age to despise her parents.  They live in a lovely home with a white picket fence, lovely roses, and a red door.  Everything about them projects an image of success.  And yet-- Lester (Kevin Spacey) hates his advertising job, which makes him feel like a prostitute selling second rate wares to stupid johns.  Caroline (Annette Benning) is frustrated at being second-best in the real estate business.  Daughter Jane (Thorah Birch) finds both of her parents vapid and doubts her own validity as a person--particularly when compared with her beautiful, sexed-up best friend Angela (Mena Suvari.)  Their lives, like the lives of so many others rushing ""to get ahead in the world,"" have become less about actually living than about maintaining and improving upon the appearance of success so prized by society.What is most astonishing about the film is its complete believability.  Speaking as one who has worked a great deal in advertising and sales, I was amazed with the accuracy with which Ball's powerful and darkly funny script captured the lives of those whose values rest exclusively upon external achievement--Lester's growing and barely concealed hatred for advertising and Caroline's constant use of self-help tapes and personal success mantras are truly commonplace in the business world.  Now, if AMERICAN BEAUTY were merely this and nothing more, it would still be an astonishing film.  But it goes considerably further than that--for Lester, suddenly motived by a lust for his daughter's friend Angela, realizes how completely unenjoyable ""keeping up appearances"" has become.  And he explodes the status quo in such a way as to bring every one's petty materialism and mask-like personaes into a sharp, very funny, and pitch-black focus as the shallow and meaningless things they are.  And in the process he both finds and destroys himself forever.The cast is astonishing throughout, with Kevin Spacey the ultimate ""I Can't Take It Any More"" man and wife Annette Benning the ultimate vision of every hard-core sales representative it has ever been my misfortune to meet, a woman determined to ""project an image of success at all times"" even if it kills her.  Thora Birch is a remarkable young performer, as is her boyfriend Wes Bentley, and Mena Suvari is perfectly cast as the youthful beauty for whom Spacey develops an unexpected passion. Mendes' direction is flawless here, and he navagates the both the complicated appearances of success and the personal shallowness it conceals with tremendous clarity, never overplaying his hand in either direction.  Perhaps the most telling bits of the film are among the most subtle, as when the film posits the tiresomely yuppie but nonetheless considerably more honest gay couple next door as more genuine than the Burhams, Caroline's eternal efforts at ego building through motivational tapes, and the way in which Angela (in time honored teenage fashion) niavely attempts to use sex as a weapon to conceal her own insecurities.The film is extremely funny, but it is also ultimately devastating.  A great many people--particularly those who equate ""an image of success"" with successful lives, will despise the film.  But like it or not, AMERICAN BEAUTY's take on the failure on the failure of the American dream is easily the most successful and deadly accurate satire on life in these United States since the equally wicked NETWORK.  This is the real thing, people--and it may be too close to home for many.  Watch it at your own risk.

67591,A3M5O6UHXO9IBU,0783239408,Gary,"[19, 40]","I suspect the reason this film is so awful is due to studio politics and the compromises that have to be made to get projects off the ground in an increasingly prohibitively expensive medium. Certainly the director Sam Mendes had to abandon his first attempt, probably because the script is such piffle it's hard to make it work. He gave it his best shot, fair enough. This isn't the truth about America, it's one script writer's view of America and judging by his CV he has not done a great deal other than work in sitcom, which says a lot about the structure, approach and choices made in this film. Trite scenes such as the throwing of the plate (queue canned laughter) and Benning's unconvincing behaviour in selling a house for instance. Nothing works or convinces, especially the fatuous notion that a father should be murdered for 'ignoring' his sibling. I suspect the writer threw in other stuff garnered from 'Sex, Lies And Video Tape' and a tasteless who-dunnit element in an attempt to make the picture seem familiar and entertaining for the audience. The bottom line was always money, not profundity.I think I'm right in saying Geffin had a hand in backing this film and there has been talk recently of a 'gay clique' in Hollywood and it's influence behind the film'making scenes. I don't know if that's the case here but the gay couple are signalled straight away as being the happiest. The film also plugs the usual gay propaganda that anyone who dislikes gays must automatically be in the closet. The scene where such an alleged person punches his son full in the chest for touching a plate is particularly unconvincing and pernicious. The portrayal of the wife and women in general all seems to come from a certain questionable perspective.The so-called spiritual element about the nature of beauty produces an unbelievably laughable scene involving a bag. One character looks at the blood matter of a brain with a hippy dippy stare that seems to say &quot;Wow man, It's so bea-u-ti-ful!&quot; I cannot believe anyone takes these preposterous contrivances with dead birds and the like seriously. It's palpable nonsense.All this huffing and puffing just for a reactionary 'Wizard Of Oz' homily about a family picture and 'there's no place like home.' The film then proceeds with some sentimental voice-over guff about leaves and the loss of youth. As the camera pulls back over suburbia and the patronising final sentiments are spoken, we can almost hear the film-makers behind the screen giggling &quot;My God, are they really BUYING all of this?&quot; Well, sadly the majority of people are sheep.The reality is that America has oppressed a large number of weaker and poorer countries over the last three decades in the guise of fighting Communism. Very few people seem to be aware of the real horror that has gone on in central America and America's hand in it, and the third world in general, at the expense and loss of life of the poorest in those societies. America is not the evil of the world but in the light of this enormous suffering and loss of an experience that only comes once to us all, are we really expected to care about the 'suffering' of Burnham and his wife and their arguments about damaging the sofa? Americans love this film because very few of them have suffered real injustice in their lives, the kind you suffer if you're born in Sudan, for instance. A price has been paid for such comforts and Americans should be grateful for the lives they have, and not whinge. Materialism does not necessarily mean a loss of inner worth or that you can deepen your world. Many have been freed to pursue personal expression, such as making drivel like this film. Be grateful for what you have in the time we have left, which in the face of increasing weapon super-technology attainment, may not be long.American Beauty's sincerity is disingenuous. It flatters to deceive. It's purpose is to make Americans feel safe and good about themselves so that the people behind it will be successful and make money. There is a machine that has to be fed and a huge amount of talentless people are out there figuring increasingly desperate ways to do so.

67592,AY12DBB0U420B,0783239408,Gary Peterson,"[1, 2]","Last night's movie was ""American Beauty"" (awards edition) and it came off our DVD shelves. We watched it about 6 years ago but I barely remembered it except for a few scenes.Well, what can I possibly say for a movie that has over a thousand Amazon reviewers? I'm not even going to try to add anything new, just give a few of my impressions. It's an excellent movie. Without question. Just look at the review ratings. Look at the awards and critical acclaims it has received. Well, folks, it has earned those awards and accolades, but you might not particularly enjoy the movie.The acting is excellent, right across the board. First rate! The characters come across as real people in real life. Kevin Spacey, in particular, stands out and is the only person in the cast that I can sympathize with. All the rest deserve their fate, in my opinion, but that's getting a bit ahead.  The story involves an ordinary family (father, mother, teen-age daughter) in an ordinary small city (possible midwestern) living in an ordinary tree-lined street. The teen-age daughter has a best friend, I might add, who enters the picture and her mother has a real-estate colleague, who likewise enters into the story. Early in the movie, A marine and his family (father, mother, teen-age son) move in next door. Well, all of the main characters are dysfunctional in some of the worst possible ways. It's a social nightmare. Hopefully, this kind of thing can happen only in Hollywood depictions, but we all know, as we view the film, that it's happening all around us wherever we happen to live. The end result is the death of the lead  character in an abrupt and graphic way. The movie comes across as a type of comedy in many places and you'll be laughing from time to time, but it''s not a comedy, folks. It's tragic from beginning to end and there are no winners. Everyone loses.It's a good movie., Very well done. There's no crying here. None of the characters are the least bit sympathetic.

I even like the plot a lot.  I only have two qualms with the movie:1) the alienation in the  suburbs motiff has been done before.  It's just too much.  The plus side is  that the message is multi-layered so it is worth repeat viewing to just  examine what exactly the story is critiquing.  You know it is complaining  about something, but the story is too engrossing to bother thinking too  hard about it on the first viewing.  But after you see it again and you  think about it, I found it too preachy.  In a liberal, holier-than-thou  sort of way.  Maybe I'm reading too much into it, I don't know.  The movie  aimed high and achieved a lot...That's why I leave off a star.  You could see this coming a mile away.  You  just have to acquainted with leftist dogmas.

67595,A1FS9R0JXHLHEG,0783239408,George Annessa,"[2, 3]","This film is one of a kind. After seeing this film last week, I was left with a hole in the pit of my stomach. It left many questions in my mind, and most of them cannot be answered. In my view, a film that makes me think after I watch it is second-to-none, and this film certainly delivers in that aspect.I was amazed with the vivid imagery in this movie, as well as with the symbolism. However, what makes this film the best of 1999 is the acting. Kevin Spacey shines as Lester Burnham, and Annette Bening (Carolyn Burnham) isn't far behind. Supporting cast members such as Wes Bentley (Ricky Fitts), Thora Birch (Jane Burnham), Mena Suvari (Angela Hayes), and Chris Cooper (Col. Frank Fitts) only add to the drama of this film. I think the most special aspect of this film is how all of the characters intertwine in a way that is believable, yet fantastic at the same time. I congratulate Sam Mendes for his direction of this film, as well as Alan Ball for writing it. I don't think it could have been any better.Rated R in the U.S. for strong sexuality, language, drug content, and violence, the film obviously deserves its rating. However, none of the causes for the R rating are overbearing, and all of them add to the plot-line of this film. While I don't think that this is a film for children, I would suggest that adults should view it with an open mind. I believe that the traits which many of the characters in this film have are found in many people around the world. Perhaps that is why this film hits close to home for so many viewers.While billed by some as a ""comedy-drama"", I don't see anything about this film as funny. Sure, there are some comedic moments, but by the end, those moments were all but forgotten when faced with the grim reality of the conclusion of the events portrayed in this film.If you want to watch a light-hearted film with some elements of comedy and some elements of drama, don't see American Beauty. But if you enjoy films that make you think, and are entertained by an excellent cast, excellent directing, and an excellent screenplay, this film should be at the top of your list.",5,A Well Deserved Oscar...,1083542400,"05 3, 2004",2004,2124,"['film', 'one', 'kind', 'seeing', 'film', 'last', 'week', 'was', 'left', 'hole', 'pit', 'stomach', 'left', 'many', 'questions', 'mind', 'most', 'can', 'not', 'be', 'answered', 'view', 'film', 'think', 'watch', 'second-to-none', 'film', 'certainly', 'aspect.I', 'was', 'amazed', 'vivid', 'imagery', 'movie', 'as', 'well', 'symbolism', 'However', 'what', 'film', 'best', '1999', 'acting', 'Kevin', 'Spacey', 'shines', 'Lester', 'Burnham', 'Annette', 'Bening', 'Carolyn', 'Burnham', ""n't"", 'far', 'behind', 'Supporting', 'cast', 'members', 'such', 'Wes', 'Bentley', 'Ricky', 'Fitts', 'Thora', 'Birch', 'Jane', 'Burnham', 'Mena', 'Suvari', 'Angela', 'Hayes', 'Chris', 'Cooper', 'Col.', 'Frank', 'Fitts', 'only', 'add', 'drama', 'film', 'think', 'most', 'special', 'aspect', 'film', 'how', 'characters', 'intertwine', 'way', 'believable', 'yet', 'fantastic', 'same', 'time', 'congratulate', 'Sam', 'Mendes', 'direction', 'film', 'as', 'well', 'Alan', 'Ball', 'writing', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'better.Rated', 'R', 'U.S.', 'strong', 'sexuality', 'language', 'drug', 'content', 'violence', 'film', 'obviously', 'rating', 'However', 'none', 'causes', 'R', 'rating', 'are', 'overbearing', 'add', 'plot-line', 'film', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'film', 'children', 'would', 'suggest', 'adults', 'should', 'view', 'open', 'mind', 'believe', 'traits', 'many', 'characters', 'film', 'have', 'are', 'found', 'many', 'people', 'world', 'Perhaps', 'why', 'film', 'close', 'home', 'so', 'many', 'viewers.While', 'billed', 'comedy-drama', 'do', ""n't"", 'see', 'anything', 'film', 'funny', 'Sure', 'are', 'comedic', 'moments', 'end', 'moments', 'were', 'forgotten', 'when', 'faced', 'grim', 'reality', 'conclusion', 'events', 'portrayed', 'film.If', 'want', 'watch', 'light-hearted', 'film', 'elements', 'comedy', 'elements', 'drama', 'do', ""n't"", 'see', 'American', 'Beauty', 'enjoy', 'films', 'make', 'think', 'are', 'entertained', 'excellent', 'cast', 'excellent', 'directing', 'excellent', 'screenplay', 'film', 'should', 'be', 'top', 'list']",Belleza Americana American Beauty  VHS
67596,A1WOFFWF8UYPJ2,0783239408,Gerald Booth,"[1, 2]","American Beauty:Have you ever just gone through the motions of life? You get your degree, get married, have the requisite child, and then go on autopilot. Day after day you struggle out of bed&#65533;maybe kiss your wife hello&#65533;maybe not&#65533;.grunt at your child and struggle in to work. You manage to smile and slink your way through the day and then it is back home again. You struggle through a meal with your wife and child where neither pays the least bit of attention to you and then it is off to bed. This is where it really gets fun since your wife wants to have nothing to do with you at this point. How would this make your feel or act? Better yet how would you act if suddenly you woke up and saw what was happening to your once promising life? American Beauty, directed by Sam Mendes, and written by Alan Ball explores this scenario and the consequences that follow.Lester Burnam has the life I described above. His wife, Carolyn, and his daughter, Jane, really have nothing to do with him. Carolyn has become the homemaker from hell with perfect meals accompanied by the sound track to South Pacific every night. She makes a living outside of the house as a real estate agent and seems to be having more success at it than Lester does in his job with a magazine, and she doesn&#65533;t let Lester forget this. Lester&#65533;s daughter Jane is going through all the typical high school angst trying to figure out where she fits in and she has no interest in having Dad as part of her life.Everything changes the night Carolyn drags Lester out to see Jane and her dance team perform at the high school game. As Lester blearily observes the performance his eyes are slowly drawn towards Jane&#65533;s friend, Angela. While he is watching her something in him begins to awaken and stir. She is a blond vision of sex drenched dreams.Shortly thereafter Lester attends a work function with his wife. While Carolyn is making eyes with the top realtor in the area, Lester comes upon his new teenage neighbor working as a waiter. They end up out back in the alley talking about life and, well for lack of a better word, smoking dope. When the headwaiter appears to chastise his errant waiter Lester is amazed to see him tell his boss where he can stick his job. The creature that was stirred by Angela is now fully inspired.Throughout the rest of the movie we see how Lester reacts to everyone that formerly had some means of control over him. The consultant at his job, his wife, and even his daughter are amazed but not necessarily pleased by the new Lester. The movie continues from this point showcasing how Lester, Carolyn, and Jane all react to the changes in life and how it effects each of them.Kevin Spacey plays Lester as if he was born to this role. He starts off the movie barely able to move from room to room. The bathroom scene shows how is wife has affected him and his despair at going to work shows through as he is barely able to stay awake. His wife runs roughshod over him and he crumbles. When he begins to undertake his transformation Spacey takes us a little step each time showing the Lester that once was as he comes forward. Spacey&#65533;s timing and dialogue skills are shown to great heights throughout. He turns a simple sentence, &#65533;I rule!&#65533; into a battlecry for all downtrodden men. Very few actors could have handled this as well.Annette Bening, as Carolyn, also does a fine job as his wife however many people could have handled this role as well. She runs the gambit from total controlling wife/mother to falling apart woman but something was missing in how she did it.Thora Birch, Jane, handled her part better than Bening. She had the teenager embarrassed to be seen with the parents down to a t. At the same time she also had her own awakening to the fact that she didn&#65533;t always have to play second fiddle to her star friend.This was an exceptionally well written movie. It did have some &#65533;artsy-fartsy&#65533; moments in it that slowed some of the scenes down but Spacey powered through them in one of his best performances yet.

I never cared for the work of Kaiser Soeze.  I find mid-life crisises to be a boring subject.  Many of the details are absurd and hard to swallow.  I'm not a fan of fractured plots esp. plots that start with the ending - what could be more played out?  starting with the main characters death is not new or clever (like in ""The Posthumous Memoirs of Bras Cubas""from the 1800s -or a more direct cinamatic comparison ""Sunset Boulevard"" with the main characters voice over and sympathetic conclusion to the love triangle before the big finale).But I do appreciate that amalgam of literary, theatrical and clean cinematic/TV writing styles that went into the story.

67599,A2PR6NXG0PA3KY,0783239408,Giordano Bruno,"[1, 2]","... if it weren't so very very sad. It's a film that rubs the intolerable emptiness and shame of our thwarted little lives in our faces, and then tries to wipe away our tears with a posthumous paean to the beauty we failed to appreciate while we were living. It's the hollowness of that paean that perturbs me. A millisecond of epiphany after two hours of grief! Ah. ""What does it all mean?"" Are the screenwriter and director being viciously ironic/sardonic or are we in Kansas after all, Toto?Six characters in search of an Author? Great ensemble acting, let's acknowledge immediately! Lester Burnham, our narrator, announces his death in a voice-over in the first minute of the film, and in a sense the plot becomes a ""who'll do it"", with every other character a candidate emotionally and with images of guns omnipresent. Lester is your seriously depressed 42-year-old male, who snaps. There's a hate-triangle in the Burnham household, of Lester, his frantic wife, and their 'emo' daughter. Then a second hate-triangle moves in next door, a ramrod Marine colonel, his catatonic wife, and their vampire son. Whoops, he's not a vampire, just an evolving sociopathic stoner, but this is a film that 'looks' like it should involve a vampire at some point. The Burnham daughter, a sullen Plain Jane, has a would-be Lolita best friend. That makes a septet of seven emotionally dischordant (sic) principals in a sexually a-tonal double fugue. Hey, is all that Hate really Love? The only people in the neighborhood who aren't emotionally dystonic are the two guys -- partners -- who live contentedly on the other side of the Burnham household. But the 'genius' of this film is that all these grotesque human miscreants are somehow pitifully plausible. But wow, I hope I'm not one of them!So who kills Lester? Of course I'm not going to tell! But really, the big question is 'why is Lester so happy being dead?'",5,This Film Might Be Very Funny ...,1320624000,"11 7, 2011",2011,1904,"['were', ""n't"", 'so', 'very', 'very', 'sad', 'film', 'intolerable', 'emptiness', 'shame', 'thwarted', 'little', 'lives', 'then', 'tries', 'wipe', 'away', 'tears', 'posthumous', 'paean', 'beauty', 'failed', 'appreciate', 'were', 'living', 'hollowness', 'paean', 'millisecond', 'epiphany', 'two', 'hours', 'grief', 'Ah', 'What', 'mean', 'Are', 'screenwriter', 'director', 'being', 'viciously', 'ironic/sardonic', 'are', 'Kansas', 'Toto', 'Six', 'characters', 'search', 'Author', 'Great', 'ensemble', 'acting', 'let', 'acknowledge', 'immediately', 'Lester', 'Burnham', 'narrator', 'death', 'voice-over', 'first', 'minute', 'film', 'sense', 'plot', 'who', ""'ll"", 'do', 'other', 'character', 'candidate', 'emotionally', 'images', 'guns', 'omnipresent', 'Lester', 'seriously', 'depressed', '42-year-old', 'male', 'who', 'hate-triangle', 'Burnham', 'household', 'Lester', 'frantic', 'wife', ""'emo"", 'daughter', 'Then', 'second', 'hate-triangle', 'moves', 'next', 'door', 'ramrod', 'Marine', 'colonel', 'catatonic', 'wife', 'vampire', 'son', 'Whoops', 'not', 'vampire', 'just', 'evolving', 'sociopathic', 'stoner', 'film', 'should', 'involve', 'vampire', 'point', 'Burnham', 'daughter', 'sullen', 'Plain', 'Jane', 'would-be', 'Lolita', 'best', 'friend', 'septet', 'seven', 'emotionally', 'dischordant', 'sic', 'principals', 'sexually', 'a-tonal', 'double', 'fugue', 'Hey', 'Hate', 'really', 'Love', 'only', 'people', 'neighborhood', 'who', 'are', ""n't"", 'emotionally', 'dystonic', 'are', 'two', 'guys', 'partners', 'who', 'live', 'contentedly', 'other', 'side', 'Burnham', 'household', ""'genius"", 'film', 'grotesque', 'human', 'miscreants', 'are', 'somehow', 'pitifully', 'plausible', 'wow', 'hope', ""'m"", 'not', 'one', 'So', 'who', 'Lester', 'course', ""'m"", 'not', 'going', 'tell', 'really', 'big', 'question', ""'why"", 'Lester', 'so', 'happy', 'being', 'dead']",Belleza Americana American Beauty  VHS
67600,AQSQLWD3NLMAS,0783239408,Glenn A. Buttkus,"[11, 12]","Director Sam Mendes is a very well known Theater director in England . He had directed actors like Judi Dench and Ralph Fiennes in classical roles, working with the Royal Shakespeare Company.  He directed Nicole Kidman in THE BLUE ROOM. He won a Tony for his Broadway revival of CABARET. Considered an ""actor's director"", Steven Spielberg (Filmworks produced the film) personally recommended Mendes for the director's chair. With an ample budget, Mendes was able to rehearse his actors for two weeks before shooting started. This always tightens dialogue and deepens characterizations. He also encouraged improvisation during the shoot. BEAUTY was his feature film debut. He did his homework, and came prepared with his story boards completed, and the movie clearly in his head. He has gone on to direct other fine films including ROAD TO PERDITION (2002), and JARHEAD (2005), which turned out to be a strong anti-war film in the guise of a gung-ho actioner.  He has been called the ""new"" Kubrick by some. He is married to Kate Winslet, and they have homes in London and California .Alan Ball, who wrote the screenplay, is a noted New York playwright. He was having lunch one windy day at the World Trade Center Plaza , and he watched a paper bag frisking and floating in the breeze; giving him the inspiration to write first a play, and then a screenplay. The theatrical version has never been produced. An outspoken gay activist and practitioner, he weaved the homosexual references expertly into the fabric of the story. It was not overdone, and it was certainly not overlooked. Much of the final action of the plot hinged on homophobia and closeted eroticism.One of the most striking things about the movie was the astonishingly good cinematography by veteran cameraman Conrad L. Hall. He won an Oscar for his effort on the film. He gave us some masterful set ups that played lovingly with light and shadow, a bit reminiscent of James Wong Howe. I really noticed this by accident when I viewed the movie in black and white as a mistake of projection. The color red was the prominent motif for much of the movie--deep red roses in vases in nearly every room in the Burnham household, roses dominating the garden along the white picket fence, the only house in the neighborhood with a bright red door, a 1970 red Pontiac Firebird, and of course blood, which makes an appearance as well. In addition Lester's middle-aged fantasies and dreams about young Angela were dripping with red rose petals, bursting from her unzipped bodice, covering the ceiling as she hovered there, filling the steaming tub that she languished in while ""awaiting"" him. Secondary to a short shooting schedule several of the scenes had to be shot at night, and Hall had to light them to appear as day shots. He was very successful in this endeavor.The wonderfully pounding driving musical score was written by veteran composer Thomas Newman. Mendes was interested in unique scoring, percussion and mallet instruments -and this intriguing thwacking moved the plot along, all the while building tension and interest. Later Newman and Conrad Hall teamed up again with Mendes when they made ROAD TO PERDITION (2002).Kevin Spacey was excellent, pitch perfect, on the mark as Lester Burnham, a kind of 90's Willy Loman. Being faced with depression, discontent, unfulfilled sexual needs, and a mid-life crisis, somehow he found the presence of mind to put his world in order. To our delight he told off his dreary supervisor, told him where to shove their job, and then blackmailed the boss for a tidy sum, citing administrative misuse of funds for libation and prostitutes. He rushed away from the white collar stress, and blissfully got a job flipping burgers at Smiley's, became infatuated with his daughter's friend, Angela, began pumping iron to impress her, became a stoner buying from Ricky, the kid next door, and he purchased his fantasy car--a 1970 red Firebird. In the midst of all this bizarre behavior, he rediscovered himself, saying that he ""was tired of being treated that I don't exist.""Annette Bening as the wife, Carolyn, infused the part with a focused, mannered, manic  hectic energy, misdirecting her considerable passion toward her garden and career at the expense of her relationship with her family, and her marriage. She was a walking jabbering divorce waiting to happen. Oddly I detected a slight lisp in her dialogue that I had not noticed in her past performances; maybe it was character driven. Thora Birch, a child actress all grown up at 17 years old, played daughter Jane. Her nude scene was daring and unexpected. She underplayed and worked well with her eyes - her timing and transitions were bang on. We all have known this teenager in our lives. Chris Cooper was very intense, real, and dislikable as Col. Frank Fitts, USMC. It was not clear to me whether he was active duty or retired. In one of the earlier drafts of the screenplay, we discovered that Fitts had a gay lover that had died in Viet Nam . I am sad that bit was cut. It could have given even more depth to the Colonel; of course that depended on when it was revealed. The kiss in the rain scene was wonderfully shocking, and it certainly did not need to be deleted. Wes Bentley was mercurial, magnetic, creepy, and very self-assured as the ""strange kid"" next door, Ricky Fitts. He played him so clever that Ricky was always two jumps ahead of his parents, his teachers, and his school mates. Beyond being the new kid in school, he was extra hard to get to know. Neighbor Jane was at first creeped out by him, than she became fascinated as she learned to appreciate his intellect and sensitivity, as they became an item. Allison Janney played his put-upon wife, Barbara; her almost catatonic stillness was haunting and horrific--a woman who had chosen to shut down rather than live in a battle zone. Mena Suvari, also a child actress, was 19 years old when she shot BEAUTY. She was tantalizing and tragic as Miss Popular, Angela Hayes, who incessantly talked about sex to mantle her lack of experience and her lack of courage. Getting by all her life on her looks, nevertheless she had no real self-confidence. She wanted to be a teen model, but one got the feeling that she lacked the drive to make it happen. She was 19 years old when she filmed BEAUTY.I loved the film, and have enjoyed repeated viewings. It is a very dark comedy that became a drama as it played out. The tragedy was connected to the humor, and yet I continuously hoped that Lester will be spared; and he never was. It is like I feel each time I watch WEST SIDE STORY (1961), hoping that Tony will not be shot during the next viewing, or that Kirk Douglas will make it out of SPARTACUS without being crucified.  Thank God the director edited out the original ending where Jane and Ricky were brought to trial and then jailed for Lester's murder, as the Colonel's wife destroyed the bloody t-shirt.",5,Heart

It contains the everyday, ordinary career Jones, the right wing family, the conservative gay couple, the frigid female, youth in three distinct varieties. All of the characters &quot;could&quot; exist, alone perhaps, but the combination here is obviously surreal, barely believeable, but somehow perfectly palatable. Together they symbolically express America's current state of travail, from the breakdown of the family to the criminalization of marijuana to the dread, morbid fear that it is not just them, but us too, who are &quot;ordinary&quot;.I loved this film, it was always implying devastatingly useful insights -- but gently, so that one was more likely to draw from it friendly insights that agree with one's point of view. It combines outlooks from both sides of the political spectrum, and somehow I fear it might be difficult for conservatives to swallow. I think Spacey's &quot;Pay it Forward&quot; was much more simplistic -- maybe he was afraid that he confused us too much with &quot;American Beauty&quot; and wanted to backpedal a bit. I certainly hope we were not confused by American Beauty. This isn't a movie just for us ethical philosophers, liberals, and recreational drug users. I think every American should watch it and draw their own conclusions.On a final note, the sound track was excellent, the theme music haunting yet friendly.

Kevin Spacey and Annette Bening stand out as your upper-class  average family with its flaws and errs. The haunting symbolism of a rose,  petals, fantasy dreams of a life that has all the desires and wants of most  anybody, all these combine to create a visual message to the audience that  people live a masked life out in the open, whereas behind closed doors the  shattering realism and moral decadence of the so-called average family is  played out mercilessly. The comedic elements enlighten what could easily be  assumed to be a gallery of depression and melancholy. It shows that people  today can only find true beauty in what they enjoy doing no matter who or  what it hurts and what morals they are tearing apart. It is truthful and  honest that today people do what they have to to be happy. The humor is at  times laugh out loud and hilarious.  Don't miss the great  performances. It has an extremely unique opening and closing that so few  films ever dare to achieve with chilling effectiveness. The score by Thomas  Newman beckons the horrid reality of what America has become in this  generation and what the family of today suffers in the breakdown process  while it is hidden under a false lifestyle to the outer world. At times it  is eerie and frightening and at others lighthearted.  Brilliant on  every level.

The plot, a bit unbalanced and sometimes went over the top. Ok, it`s a dark comedy but that ending is neither dark nor comic and just doesn`t fit with the rest of the story.

Comfortable middleclass white Anglo-Saxon Protestant suburban America, for instance. Well, let's zoom in on this nice representative street and test that hypothesis. Eddie Murphy and Wesley Snipes do not live in this neighbourhood. Their kids do not go to school with these kids. Surely, noone here is in Bruce Willis's Color Of Night psycho self-help group. Squad cars do not patrol this street. They and all other nasties and challenges to normalcy are out of sight beyond an invisible hermetic barrier.Sure enough, as we zoom in for a closer look, here is a nice normal couple, Lester and Carolyn Burnham (Kevin Spacey and Annette Bening). Lester is in advertising, and in mid-life crisis. Carolyn is a real estate agent dedicated to living by appearances, playing self-improvement tapes in the car, and swapping lifestyle and gardening tips with the homosexual couple next door. We know Lester and Carolyn once had sex, because they have an only child, Jane (Thora Birch). She hates her weird parents and wants only to live in a normal healthy environment like the Addams Family, or a remake of The Exorcist -- when she is not hanging out with her geek-next-door boyfriend.Meanwhile, the conjugally challenged, burnt-out Lester has the hots for his daughter's Lolita-esque best friend (Mena Suvari). Fantasies about her embellish his day.The climax of the film is a real surprise (which I won't spoil here).

67610,A9YTARTKZRXL,0783239408,"""greysky""","[5, 8]","It is really very hard hard to explain simply what makes American Beauty so brilliant- what it has that so many other movies lack. This is probably because of the strange plot of the movie, one that could almost hurt it's  reviews. Almost.You see, in this satirical portrayal of a suburban  family rebelling against the constraints imposed on them by society and by  themselves, things are not always what they seem. A man who's barely there  is about to have a sudden surge in spirit, and will begin to persue his  daughter's best friend, who has become his sexual obsession. A new neighbor  boy, who sells drugs part time and is obsessed with moviemaking and beauty  will change the life of a very lonely, very dissatisfied young girl. A wife  who cheats on her husband will be driven to the edge, to the breaking  point, when she becomes murderous.And in American Beauty, it all fits  together.The true power in this movie comes from the characters  themselves- upon closer inspection they are all deeper and more complex  than they seem, something that is backed up by the great acting. The plot  flows along nicely as you discover more and more about the characters, and  in the end, there aren't really any good guys or bad guys (except for one  character, who is utterly distraught)- it's like the Chinese Yin and Yang.  A little bad in good- a little good in bad.This is a movie that succeeds  on many levels; while it is incredibly mundane and realistic, it is  beautiful and vast in scope. It can be watched over and over, and each  viewing provides new insight not caught before.I would suggest that if  you are over 17 you see this movie.

67613,A25FDX17O3QKLT,0783239408,Hallstatt Prince,"[6, 9]","The movie begins in an ominous way  with the video taping of girl who is asks  a friend to kill her father. Not meaning to be a spoiler but we are being set up by this scene.The next scene we see, the actual beginning of the movie, is an aerial shot of a tree lined street as Kevin Spacey begins to narrate the story. He tells us  that  he is  42  and ""in less than a year he will be dead""The introductory narration is  done in somewhat of a funny sarcastic deadpan.Lester Burnham (played by Spacey) lives in a nice neighborhood  and is  married to his  wife Carolyn (Annette Bening) who trys to keep a picture perfect house that would make Martha Stewart proud.Lester bemoans  his joyless life but as  Lester says in his narration before the story begins it is never too late to make a change.We  learn Lester is stuck at a job he hates and we see him spending his days on the phone dealing with clients.His wife  is a driven woman who puts on a false front.  Lester and Carolyn are obviously following two different paths although both are going through a middle age crisis. Most of the adults in this movie are portrayed as living lives that are lies.They have a teenage daughter, Jane, going through her own painful transition in her life.Camera work, music and editing come together to humorously highlight the absurdity of the  life style Carolyn has made for her family and with which Lester until recently has gone along.New neighbors move in next door to the Burnhams who will play an important role in their lives. The new family is run by a tyrannical military man.But  as the story proceeds three  new characters come into their lives: for Annette Bening it is ""The Real Estate King"", for their daughter it is the boy who moves in next door and for Lester it is his daughter's best friend.Three  events precipitate what comes to follow: the arrival of the new neighbors, a cheerleading performance at a basket ball game and a party for real estate agents.The Burnhams travel to the basket ball game to see their daughter perform and their Lester becomes smitten with  his daughter's best friend and so he begins an obsession with this Lolita.At a party for real estate agents Carolyn puts does he best  to be the picture of confidence (Bening is quite  brilliant as her performance of the confident real estate agent which borders on the surreal and absurd) and does her best to schmooze and  to cozy up to ""The Real Estate King"". Lester who is bored out of his wits at the party meets Ricky Fitz, the boy next door. Ricky's  is a waiter at the party but the job is really just a cover for his very profitable business as a marijuana dealer. Lester and Ricky step out back where  Lester is reintroduced to pot.Later we find  Ricky has a fascination with the Burnham's daughter something she learns when she discovers him surreptitiously filming her.Other than Lester, Ricky is the most pivotal character in the story. He is constantly beaten by his father, did a stint in military school and after  nearly beating a fellow  student to death spends time in a mental hospital. Through it all the suffering he has gone though  he find himself on a  spiritual journey seeing the world as being overwhelmingly beautiful and is now wise beyond his years.  His hobby is video taping everything he sees especially the beauty of the world. Included in the beautiful things that fascinate him are the  eyes of a homeless man who had just died. To paraphrase Ricky says he  could see  God  looking back at him through the eyes of the dead man. There is a beautiful sequence where  Ricky shows  Jane one of his favorite tapes - a bag  dancing in the wind. Despite his criminal profession Ricky can be seen as a young holy man. Also  he seems to symbolize the movie's creators themselves as his fascination with the lens and Ricky's can be seen as being one and the same.Things progress quickly. Carolyn  continues with her quest for the good life and ends up having and affair with the ""Real Estate King"" whereas Lester quits his job and blackmails his boss into giving him a large severance package and  starts working at a fast food restaurant. There is definite a clash of paths, of values and cultures between Lester and his wife.Lester buys himself the car of his boyhood dreams, listens to the music of his youth, smokes pot and lifts weights. He also continues  his obsession with his daughters' friend until finally the two of them come together. (during this important sequence we are treated to Neil Young's poignant ""Don't Let it Bring You Down""  sung softly in the background).  She offers herself to him willingly  but  Lester  refuses and in that instant things seem to come together for Lester both realizing  his responsibility as an adult and his love for his family. It is a type of epiphany for Lester.Immediately there after Lester has his brains blown out. To tell you the name of the assailant would take away the surprise.But the fact that  the lovable Spacey character is now dead is portrayed as a joyous thing and his narration that concludes the movie which sums up his life in a very moving, joyous and hopeful. And in the end everyone seems to experience a type of salvation.Some of the movie is  social satire  but the overwhelming  message of the movie is the holiness and mystical nature of life and the idea that life and death are on a continuum -  very much in tune with poets such as William Blake, Walt Whitman and Allen Ginsberg.A wonderful choice of music accentuates the mystical feeling of the movie including the main score which is made up of percussion instruments and that has a somewhat oriental feel to it.So what does the title refer to? Does it refer to the roses Carolyn tends  or the  Lolita  Lester pursues? I think it is neither. America Beauty for this reviewer seems to refer to  American life. Although is may be materialistic and filled with disappointments has a holiness to it.Highly recommended",5,Middle aged crisis and the mystical nature of life,1118534400,"06 12,

Just finished giving it my second watch.My first watch made this the best movie I had seen till that date.My second watch taught me there are two types of emotions attached to tears. I cried out of the third though.Thomas Newman's famous Plastic Bag Theme that plays its current of absolute enigmatic melody througout the film only adds to the overburdening significance of What I saw in this film.There are six main characters in this film. There are scenes when my brain waved an invisible white flag to what it saw.Chris Cooper (Ricky's dad) has done many movies before. I quite enjoyed the absolute rigidity of his character. Kevin Spacey is just so befitting in this ordinary man's role of his that I would think twice before doubting his contribution to the whole plot.The numer of times in this film that I felt this overwhelmed recreated feeling of absolute bliss is quite absurd.Its alarming how absolutely flawless and perfect this movie stands.Note:If you have not seen this film , I don't believe your wasting your time reading this review of mine.

Anyway, I'll try again so here goes.American Beauty is perhaps one of the best films I've ever seen.  The main theme of the movie was beauty and how a seemingly typical surburban family went about looking for it in the wrong way.  Kevin Spacey's monologue at the end of the picture along with the part with the plastic bag blowing in the wind is a playing out of the statements: &quot;there is beauty in simplicity&quot; - unknown. &quot;matters of great concern should be taken lightly and matters of little concern should be taken seriously&quot; - Hagakure Book of the Samurai.  In other words, beauty is not how much money you have in your wallet, what kind of car you drive, getting high, and a good-looking high school girl.  Beauty is all around us in seemingly mundane things from a plastic bag blowing in the wind to the clouds in the sky.I think that the people who will reflect on this film and act on it's message are not your typical suburbanites, but people who are already living fairly humble lives.  This is unfortuate, but most people are too caught up in materialism, sex and drugs to take a movie like this all that seriously.  I have to say that people who didn't like this film or just considered it &quot;OK&quot; are very superficial people.",5,what happend to my review?,975283200,"11 27, 2000",2000,1340,"['typed', 'up', 'review', 'week', 'ago', 'never', 'got', 'posted', 'why', 'Anyway', ""'ll"", 'try', 'again', 'so', 'here', 'goes.American', 'Beauty', 'perhaps', 'one', 'best', 'films', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'seen', 'main', 'theme', 'movie', 'was', 'beauty', 'how', 'seemingly', 'typical', 'surburban', 'family', 'went', 'looking', 'wrong', 'way', 'Kevin', 'Spacey', 'monologue', 'end', 'picture', 'part', 'plastic', 'bag', 'blowing', 'wind', 'playing', 'statements', 'quot', 'beauty', 'simplicity', 'quot', 'unknown', 'quot', 'matters', 'great', 'concern', 'should', 'be', 'taken', 'lightly', 'matters', 'little', 'concern', 'should', 'be', 'taken', 'seriously', 'quot', 'Hagakure', 'Book', 'Samurai', 'other', 'words', 'beauty', 'not', 'how', 'much', 'money', 'have', 'wallet', 'what', 'kind', 'car', 'drive', 'getting', 'high', 'good-looking', 'high', 'school', 'girl', 'Beauty', 'seemingly', 'mundane', 'things', 'plastic', 'bag', 'blowing', 'wind', 'clouds', 'sky.I', 'think', 'people', 'who', 'will', 'reflect', 'film', 'act', 'message', 'are', 'not', 'typical', 'suburbanites', 'people', 'who', 'are', 'already', 'living', 'fairly', 'humble', 'lives', 'unfortuate', 'most', 'people', 'are', 'too', 'caught', 'up', 'materialism', 'sex', 'drugs', 'take', 'movie', 'seriously', 'have', 'say', 'people', 'who', 'did', ""n't"", 'like', 'film', 'just', 'considered', 'quot', 'OK', 'quot', 'are', 'very', 'superficial', 'people']",Belleza Americana American Beauty  VHS

67619,A457S8SW690NM,0783239408,hi,"[7, 37]","Besides the funny moments in this film, there is nothing good about it. Kevin Spacey delivers some very funny moments and the music in the movie is good but the movie itself isn't good at all. First of all, it's nothing about beauty. So don't expect this movie to be beautiful. It's disturbing and grotesque. I'm sure that everyone probably agrees with me that there is normally a protagonist in movies. Well, not here. There are no heroes but only perverted and strange people.There's the frustrated dad who doesn't get any sex from his wife and whose daughter hates him. He only is freed from his problems with his family when he falls in love with his daughter's best friend. I know, that's disgusting. So now, he's working out, blackmails his boss, smokes pot and does whatever he wants. No hero there.The girl that he falls in love with is obssessed with sex and finds herself to be ""not oridinary"" and beautiful. She's very dirty and isn't a hero.Then, there's his wife, the realtor who likes material possessions and cheats on him and doesn't seem to care. She calls herself a victim, and may I ask: ""of what?"" You're rich, you have a family, how the hell are you victim? And then she even considers killing her husband because she's a victim. And she doesn't even know that he is fantasizing about someone. Wow. No hero there.Then there's their daughter who hates both of them, especially her dad. For what reason? I don't know! She even jokes about wanting to kill him. That's not a very pleasant joke! She wants breast implants even though she has large enough ones. (She flashes her boyfriend). No hero there.Then, there's the daughter's boyfriend. He's a psycho who films everything and sells pot secretely. When you're supposed to like him, it's hard to.Then there's the boyfriend's dad who is a veteran army lieutenant. He's abusive and very violent and mean. And he has some skeletons in his closet. No hero there either.See, the movie was hard to watch because you don't like any of the characters in the movie. It was depressing to see our society shown as it is and without any character that you like, well...The movie had too many sex references and also had lots of uneccessary and weird stuff. Like when Kevin Spacey's character fantacizes, WEIRD!The worse for me though is that I had lots of high expectations for this movie and it ended out being nothing spectacular, just a mediocre and not memorable movie. The acting is good as are some jokes, but it really isn't what everyone says it is. It's not original and is very strange. There were also many random scenes in it and well...I don't even recommend it for a rent unless you want to see what the fuss is all about but the academy must have different opinions than me because this movie didn't deserve best picture. I enjoyed Kevin Spacey as usual in a very strong performance but the movie wasn't strong or interesting. It was about a man breaking free thanks to an 18 year old girl that he falls for but unfortunately the movie didn't do what I thought that it would.Buddy Kane: ""Who's the king?""Me: ""Definitely not Sam Mendes!!!!!""",2,"Best Picture?

67620,ABFJYHVD8RHLE,0783239408,Hillary,"[1, 2]","Kevin Spacey gives a wonderfully sympathetic performance as struggling loser, Lester Burnham. The movie opens interestingly at the end, looking back on how things came to be. This is in a similar 20/20 hindsight fashion, to the way Al Pacino narrates from the future in Brian DePalmas ""Carlito's Way"". Also similarly, the plot is not ruined by this odd chronology.Lester is an everyday average, albeit underachieving husband, scorned and rediculed by wife Carolyn, played by a disatisfied, shrill and ""joyless"" Annette Bening. Carolyn sells real estate, and wonders why her husband isn't more successful. The unhappy couple has one unhappy daughter named Jane, played by a beautifully sullen and distant Thora Birch. From the outset, we can see the gap between parent and child, that cannot be bridged.Poor Lester, nobody has an ounce of respect for him. The best part about it is, Spacey's Lester couldn't care less, and pulls no punches in making his attitude clear.  He takes great pride in humiliating wife Carolyn at a real estate party where she is trying to impress a town real estate king, played by the eyebrow king  himself, the tweezer challenged Peter Gallagher.  Carolyn becomes smitten with the mogul and begins a clandestine and tawdry affair where she has to scream ""You're The King"", during each of their encounters.  Truly a comic highpoint in the film.  Also humorous is the spaced-out Spacey, smoking pot with his newly aquainted neighbor Ricky, oustide the party.  Lester can't stop giggling, as Carolyn drags him from the back alley.Speaking of which, newcomer Wes Bentley is eerily sedate as Ricky, the drug dealing neighbor, who is fascinated with Birch's Jane, and secretly video-tapes her. Jane thinks he's a weirdo, especially when disapproving Angela (Mena Suvari) deems him so.There is Ricky's homophobe father, who is obsessive, abusive and dangerous. He forces his son to submit to urine drug tests, and beats Ricky nearly to death after finding his Nazi paraphenalia disturbed in the family china cabinet. Ricky's seemingly catatonic schizophrenic mom, is by contrast, completely oblivious to everything. We are left to wonder if her husband is the cause of her quiet derangement.This is a strange, comic tragedy that is difficult to summarize. While many of the elements are familiar, they must be absorbed and pieced together by you as you watch, and watch it you SHOULD. ""American Beauty"" is a fascinating look at the collapse of a seemingly average family, with a theme that all of us can understand, and sometimes relate to, with a message that many of us could benefit from.",5,Dysfunctional Beauty...,1024963200,"06 25, 2002",2002,2612,"['Kevin', 'Spacey', 'wonderfully', 'sympathetic', 'performance', 'struggling', 'loser', 'Lester', 'Burnham', 'movie', 'interestingly', 'end', 'looking', 'back', 'how', 'things', 'came', 'be', 'similar', '20/20', 'hindsight', 'fashion', 'way', 'Al', 'Pacino', 'future', 'Brian', 'DePalmas', 'Carlito', 'Way', 'Also', 'similarly', 'plot', 'not', 'ruined', 'odd', 'chronology.Lester', 'everyday', 'average', 'underachieving', 'husband', 'scorned', 'rediculed', 'wife', 'Carolyn', 'played', 'disatisfied', 'shrill', 'joyless', 'Annette', 'Bening', 'Carolyn', 'real', 'estate', 'wonders', 'why', 'husband', ""n't"", 'more', 'successful', 'unhappy', 'couple', 'one', 'unhappy', 'daughter', 'named', 'Jane', 'played', 'beautifully', 'sullen', 'distant', 'Thora', 'Birch', 'outset', 'can', 'see', 'gap', 'parent', 'child', 'can', 'not', 'be', 'bridged.Poor', 'Lester', 'nobody', 'ounce', 'respect', 'best', 'part', 'Spacey', 'Lester', 'could', ""n't"", 'care', 'less', 'punches', 'making', 'attitude', 'clear', 'great', 'pride', 'humiliating', 'wife', 'Carolyn', 'real', 'estate', 'party', 'where', 'trying', 'impress', 'town', 'real', 'estate', 'king', 'played', 'eyebrow', 'king', 'tweezer', 'challenged', 'Peter', 'Gallagher', 'Carolyn', 'smitten', 'mogul', 'clandestine', 'tawdry', 'affair', 'where', 'scream', ""'re"", 'King', 'encounters', 'Truly', 'comic', 'highpoint', 'film', 'Also', 'humorous', 'spaced-out', 'Spacey', 'smoking', 'pot', 'newly', 'aquainted', 'neighbor', 'Ricky', 'party', 'Lester', 'ca', ""n't"", 'stop', 'giggling', 'Carolyn', 'back', 'alley.Speaking', 'newcomer', 'Wes', 'Bentley', 'eerily', 'sedate', 'Ricky', 'drug', 'dealing', 'neighbor', 'who', 'fascinated', 'Birch', 'Jane', 'secretly', 'video-tapes', 'Jane', 'weirdo', 'especially', 'when', 'disapproving', 'Angela', 'Mena', 'Suvari', 'Ricky', 'homophobe', 'father', 'who', 'obsessive', 'abusive', 'dangerous', 'son', 'submit', 'urine', 'drug', 'tests', 'beats', 'Ricky', 'nearly', 'death', 'finding', 'Nazi', 'paraphenalia', 'disturbed', 'family', 'china', 'cabinet', 'Ricky', 'seemingly', 'catatonic', 'schizophrenic', 'mom', 'contrast', 'completely', 'oblivious', 'everything', 'are', 'left', 'wonder', 'husband', 'cause', 'quiet', 'derangement.This', 'strange', 'comic', 'tragedy', 'difficult', 'summarize', 'many', 'elements', 'are', 'familiar', 'must', 'be', 'absorbed', 'pieced', 'together', 'watch', 'watch', 'SHOULD', 'American', 'Beauty', 'fascinating', 'look', 'collapse', 'seemingly', 'average', 'family', 'theme', 'can', 'understand', 'sometimes', 'relate', 'message', 'many', 'could', 'benefit']",Belleza Americana American Beauty  VHS

67629,A192KEPM0HW6AC,0783239408,"Interplanetary Funksmanship ""Swift lippin', e...","[66, 111]","""American Beauty"" opens and closes with Kevin Spacey's narration from the grave, an idea lifted from Billy Wilder's 1950 masterpiece ""Sunset Boulevard."" Similarities end there: The caustic and brilliant cynicism of Wilder and Charles Brackett's last screenplay together has been replaced by Alan Ball's *pose* of same. When it came out, there was a lot of talk about how ""courageous"" this movie's producers were. I saw no courage in it; merely a clich&eacute;d portrait of suburbia.Suburbia as a soul-draining no man's land is nothing new in Hollywood. ""The Man in the Grey Flannel Suit,"" (1955) explored similar themes, and Gregory Peck even shared the same (by now hackneyed) profession -- advertising man -- as Kevin Spacey's anti-hero, Lester. In the classic movie, Peck puts his job on the line to maintain his integrity, and wins. Spacey's ""modernized"" rat boosts his severance package by blackmailing his firm's ""efficiency expert,"" and then uses the proceeds to forever chuck his responsibilities.Its premise, that Spacey has (unbeknownst to him) just a year to live shows him in the throes of a ""mid-life crisis"" in which we find him ""living each day as if it were my last."" So, does he go and write the great American novel? Does he reinvigorate his neglected family life? No; he quits his dead-end job to work at a fast food joint (obviously, a much more self-fulfilling career), exercises, buys a red Firebird and lusts after his teenage daughter's best friend. Whereas Wilder and Brackett conjured memorable flesh-and-blood characters from the printed page, ""Beauty"" scenarist Ball has a reverse-alchemy going on: Despite lots of gratuitous flesh, the characters come off as two-dimensional cardboard cutouts.There was a saying in the dramatic world, ""the play's the thing."" Now, ""the agenda's the thing."" All the characters in this movie aren't characters at all, but *representatives*, stand-ins for various social and political agendas.""American Beauty"" is marketed with the slogan ""Look Closer"": ""Look closer,"" you'll see that the gay couple across the street is just like you and me; the ""macho,"" homophobic, Marine is really a repressed homosexual (who didn't see that coming a mile away?); the ""weird"" drug-dealing peeping-Tom is really a well of philosophical profundity, rivaling Gandhi in depth and Mother Teresa in altruistic impulse; the popular cheerleader is actually this shy, lonely virgin (yeah, right), and the chiseled-chin real estate guy is your typical Hollywood capitalist -- shallow, ruthless, a philanderer and (big surprise) a gun nut. No matter how much I ""looked closer,"" I couldn't see any real people, or even ideal people that used to populate Hollywood fare. Instead, I kept seeing this PC playbook, written by some narcissistic baby-boomer who demands people view his movie with an open mind, but who himself sees life with blinders on.As character studies, Lester and his wife Carolyn (played by Annette Bening) ain't Joe Gillis and Norma Desmond. In ""Sunset Boulevard,"" William Holden and Gloria Swanson weren't exactly people you'd want in your living room, but you'd certainly go to the Bijou to study them night after night. Their disturbing relationship was larger-than-life human nature at its darkest and most melodramatic. With ""American Beauty,"" it's the people that have gotten small.Occasionally, I actually sympathize with Lester, especially when he's being sarcastic to his wife. But all-in-all, the characterizations are just laughable at best: The scene in which Annette Bening becomes a ""gun-nut"" and goes to the range to work out her frustrations, she manages to get tight shot groups despite her rising arms, due to her twisted, manic, facial expression and breathing while shooting. It's a scene that could only have been written by an anti-gun activist with an axe to grind. Real people at firing ranges know they can't shoot well unless they're calm and collected.But that would contradict the moviemakers' agenda. Likewise with the homosexual couple: They're merely props for Mendes and Balls politics; out of all the main characters in the movie, they have the least screen time (only about 2-3 minutes total), and are only in the script to represent ""normality."" With all the talk the PC crowd devotes to the ""trivialization"" of marginalized peoples, you'd think someone would've complained about how trivial these gay characters were; aside from idly chatting with neighbors, delivering flowers to new arrivals on the block and jogging, the viewer knows nothing about them. But, since Jim and Jim weren't written to be interesting beyond their function as poster children, Ball and Mendes didn't see the necessity.Ultimately, ""look closer"" is a great marketing tool, because upon looking closer, the viewer is left as bereft of any inspiration or entertainment as upon entering. That's how clever its producers are. This gimmick is a new spin on an old Grimm brothers fable, ""The Emperor's New Clothes"": If YOU can't understand it, then it MUST be deep; if you don't agree with Mendes and Ball's worldview, then YOU must be a social regressive; if you don't think suburban life is as bad as they paint it, then YOU'RE not looking ""closely"" enough, and; if upon looking closer, you find it shallow and vapid, then YOU lack depth.In reality, it's Ball and Mendes lack depth: You can't have you're cynical cake and eat your sugarcoated agenda, too. Proof lies in another movie from 1999, ""Election,"" by writer/director Alexander Payne, which explored identical themes as ""American Beauty."" However, ""Election"" bristles with real cynicism, and Payne presents people like you've actually known in your lifetime, and actually gets to the heart of what motivates them in a panoply of human nature. Matthew Broderick and Reese Witherspoon play *internally* motivated people, and thus came off as believable characters, complete in themselves; The cast of ""American Beauty"" were merely crude marionettes dancing on the strings manipulated by an all-thumbs screenwriter and director.The fact that ""Election"" was not even nominated for any Oscars shows that members of the Academy ""looked closer,"" but obviously not at any other movies.",1,"Look Closer: Hectoring, Moralizing, Stridency",1026345600,"07 11, 2002",2002,6197,"['American', 'Beauty', 'opens', 'closes', 'Kevin', 'Spacey',

67630,A35FIQ83PE0E07,0783239408,Irikefe Okonedo,"[0, 0]","Drama in which a middle-class suburban family begins to fall apart when husband and father Kevin Spacey starts going through a mid-life crisis, quitting his job as a magazine writer, befriending his teenage daughter Thora Birch's boyfriend Wes Bentley, starting to smoke marijuana and beginning an obsession with his daughter's best friend Mena Suvari, all in an attempt to dispel the deadness that he feels inside and regain the happiness that he feels that he has not had since he was a young man. Spacey's behaviour serves to further destabilise his already dysfunctional family in which his daughter despises him and his wife Annette Bening and him never have sex: now his wife runs into the arms of another man and his daughter progresses from despising him to being outright sickened by him because of his obvious sexual interest in her best friend. But Spacey doesn't care because he feels that his life was a sham anyway and the only way he can regain what he has lost is by letting go of all the lies and pretences and doing whatever will make him and him alone happy. This film is populated by largely tragic characters, all struggling to make sense of life and escape the despair and bleakness that seems to them to be all that there is. Spacey is reliable as the voice of the movie and the main protagonist going through the mid-life crisis who moves from sympathetic to unsympathetic to sympathetic through the course of the movie. Thora Birch is excellent as Spacey's teenage daughter who feels that she is a misfit and forms a relationship with troubled boy next door and drug dealer Wes Bentley, who has been inside a mental institution and has an unsettling habit of filming people on his camcorder when they don't know he is watching. Annette Bening is on form as Spacey's desperately unhappy estate agent wife whose primary concern is putting on a faade of marital and domestic bliss for the world to see to hide the fact that her family and marriage are falling apart. Mena Suvari puts in a favourable performance as Birch's insecure best friend who derives her self-esteem from the fact that men find her sexually attractive but is secretly afraid that she is nothing special and hence will never gain the adulation that she craves. Finally Chris Cooper is good in a supporting role as Birch's boyfriend Bentley's violent and homophobic father. This film, although largely bleak in tone and quite disturbing at times, is poignant and has a profound message about the importance of seeing beauty in life, which director Sam Mendes symbolises throughout the film with red petals from the American Beauty rose (from which the film takes its name). With a number of revelations and a shocking final twist, this is one of the best films I have ever seen, and easily deserves the Oscars that it won.

67639,A1A535W556ROBQ,0783239408,James Ferguson,"[2, 4]","This movie has a strong seductive appeal but ultimately is a very shallow look at lust.  Lester is a bit too superficial a characterization of a man experiencing mid-life crisis, as he tries to reclaim his lost youth. Keven Spacey plays Lester with plenty of hubris but with very little meaning.  More impressive, by far, is Chris Cooper's characterization of a deeply repressed father who ultimately has to confront his own sexuality. Unfortunately 3 teens get caught between these two disfunctional father-figures and thereby creating the rub of the story.Lester has become fixated on his daughter's high school friend, played with coquettish delight by Mena Suvari.  Unfortunately Mena never rises above an object of affection, with the camera fawning over her every move as it would in a soft porn movie.  Meanwhile, Lester's daughter (Thora Birch) is drawn to a reclusive, sensitive teen (Wes Bentley) who becomes Sam Mendes' surrogate in the fim.  The young teen turns out to be a voyeur, capturing Thora's every move on digital film.  This oddly narcissistic relationship also fails to develop in any meaningful way other than to provide the occasional ephemoral image such as Wes filming a plastic bag as it is picked up by a swirling wind and tossed about in the air while Thora vacuously looks on.  Then we have Lester's wife (Annette Bening) who is pursuing an affair of her own with her real estate broker (Peter Gallagher) who promises to take her to great heights, only to be shocked that her husband could stoop so low as to work in a burger stand, when they pull up for a hamburger.  The movie would have easily drifted out of control if it weren't for Cooper's mesmerizing performance as the authoritarian father who can no longer discipline his son.  Cooper ultimately is forced to confront Spacey in the most memorable scene of this movie, and probably what earned this film its Oscar.  But, Mendes makes it painfully clear in the closing scenes that he didn't know how to handle the fallout of the confrontation, opting for the easy way out.The characters will grab you and the film is well choreographed, but this is another case of style over substance. It reminded me alot of Magnolia, in its attempt to create highly emotive scenes without providing sufficient background for the viewer to identify with these emotions. I think mostly because Mendes and Ball didn't understand these emotions themselves, but see them as convenient stage tools to create this impressionistic view of suburban America.",3,Just so much stage craft,1077753600,"02 26, 2004",2004,2523,"['movie', 'strong', 'seductive', 'appeal', 'ultimately', 'very', 'shallow', 'look', 'lust', 'Lester', 'bit', 'too', 'superficial', 'characterization', 'man', 'experiencing', 'mid-life', 'crisis', 'reclaim', 'lost', 'youth', 'Keven', 'Spacey', 'Lester', 'plenty', 'hubris', 'very', 'little', 'meaning', 'More', 'impressive', 'far', 'Chris', 'Cooper', 'characterization', 'deeply', 'repressed', 'father', 'who', 'ultimately', 'confront', 'own', 'sexuality', 'Unfortunately', '3', 'teens', 'get', 'caught', 'two', 'disfunctional', 'father-figures', 'thereby', 'creating', 'rub', 'story.Lester', 'become', 'fixated', 'daughter', 'high', 'school', 'friend', 'played', 'coquettish', 'delight', 'Mena', 'Suvari', 'Unfortunately', 'Mena', 'never', 'object', 'affection', 'camera', 'fawning', 'move', 'would', 'soft', 'porn', 'movie', 'Meanwhile', 'Lester', 'daughter', 'Thora', 'Birch', 'drawn', 'reclusive', 'sensitive', 'teen', 'Wes', 'Bentley', 'who', 'Sam', 'Mendes', 'surrogate', 'fim', 'young', 'teen', 'out', 'be', 'voyeur', 'capturing', 'Thora', 'move', 'digital', 'film', 'oddly', 'narcissistic', 'relationship', 'also', 'develop', 'meaningful', 'way', 'other', 'provide', 'occasional', 'ephemoral', 'image', 'such', 'Wes', 'filming', 'plastic', 'bag', 'picked', 'up', 'swirling', 'wind', 'tossed', 'about', 'air', 'Thora', 'vacuously', 'Then', 'have', 'Lester', 'wife', 'Annette', 'Bening', 'who', 'pursuing', 'affair', 'own', 'real', 'estate', 'broker', 'Peter', 'Gallagher', 'who', 'take', 'great', 'heights', 'only', 'be', 'shocked', 'husband', 'could', 'stoop', 'so', 'low', 'work', 'burger', 'stand', 'when', 'pull', 'up', 'hamburger', 'movie', 'would', 'have', 'easily', 'drifted', 'control', 'were', ""n't"", 'Cooper', 'mesmerizing', 'performance', 'authoritarian', 'father', 'who', 'can', 'no', 'longer', 'discipline', 'son', 'Cooper', 'ultimately', 'forced', 'confront', 'Spacey', 'most', 'memorable', 'scene', 'movie', 'probably', 'what', 'earned', 'film', 'Oscar', 'Mendes', 'painfully', 'clear', 'closing', 'scenes', 'did', ""n't"", 'know', 'how', 'handle', 'fallout', 'confrontation', 'opting', 'easy', 'way', 'out.The', 'characters', 'will', 'grab', 'film', 'well', 'choreographed', 'case', 'style', 'substance', 'reminded', 'alot', 'Magnolia', 'attempt', 'create', 'highly', 'emotive', 'scenes', 'providing', 'sufficient', 'background', 'viewer', 'identify', 'emotions', 'think', 'mostly', 'Mendes', 'Ball', 'did', ""n't"", 'understand', 'emotions', 'see', 'convenient', 'stage', 'tools', 'create', 'impressionistic', 'view', 'suburban', 'America']",Belleza Americana American Beauty  VHS

No, getting the fast-food job wasn't the answer... trading in his car wasn't the answer... and just before seducing the fantasy girl, he realizes that wouldn't be it either.

67648,A3DE1IYJGU5HPW,0783239408,Jason N. Mical,"[0, 0]","American Beauty is one of those rare Hollywood films that actually dares to push boundaries, make audiences think, and - most importantly - impress enough people that it wins a much-deserved Academy Award.American Beauty is many things; a not-so-subtle portrayal of the hollowness of consumerism and consumer culture, a coming of age story, a treatise on the Heideggerian notion of beauty existing everywhere.  It manages to weave all these things together splendidly, while leaving the viewers enough room to work things out on their own.  Some of the symbolism is blatant, and the shallowness in suburbia where &quot;nothing is as it seems&quot; is nothing new, and other films have probably dealt with it in better ways, but American Beauty manages to overcome this flaws mostly with outstanding performances from all the main actors, especially Spacey and Benning.Some of the characters, especially Ricky's dad and mom, and occasionally Benning's Mrs. Burnham, are a little underdeveloped and two-dimensional.  Many of Thora Birch's lines to Kevin Spacey seem a little &quot;stereotypical&quot; of the &quot;angst-ridden teen,&quot; and almost push the boundaries of plausibility, especially in the beginning - &quot;you can't just expect to be my best friend just because you had a bad day at work&quot; comes off as forced, no matter how many times I watch that scene.There is nothing special with the cinematography, and the cgi-roses are almost an overused, tired metaphor at the end of the film.American Beauty is a moving, disturbing piece of filmmaking that manages to put some heavy philisophical concepts regarding art and aesthetics into forms that the average Joe can understand, and will satisfy even those who feel Hollywood turns out nothing decent anymore.  Sit back and enjoy one of the many gems that Hollywood turned out in its bumper crop of good films last year.DVD Dirt -The transfers are good, but not perfect.  There are minor black lines and dots throughout the film, especially noticable whenever there is a lot of color on the screen.  The sound seems a little quiet as well.  The commentary is supposedly by director Sam Mendes and writer Alan Ball, but Ball hardly manages to get a word in edgewise, and Mendes really doesn't share any earth-shattering insights about the film, although they do manage to talk the entire time, which is refreshing.  The behind-the-scenes featurette is OK, although almost seems like filler they added just to say it was there.  Some deleted scenes might have been nice, especially the entire original introduction, but I guess we'll have to wait for it.",4,"Awards Edition good, but deserves no awards",972432000,"10 25, 2000",2000,2618,"['American', 'Beauty', 'one', 'rare', 'Hollywood', 'films', 'actually', 'push', 'boundaries', 'make', 'audiences', 'think', 'most', 'importantly', 'impress', 'enough', 'people', 'much-deserved', 'Academy', 'Award.American', 'Beauty', 'many', 'things', 'not-so-subtle', 'portrayal', 'hollowness', 'consumerism', 'consumer', 'culture', 'coming', 'age', 'story', 'treatise', 'Heideggerian', 'notion', 'beauty', 'existing', 'everywhere', 'weave', 'things', 'together', 'splendidly', 'leaving', 'viewers', 'enough', 'room', 'work', 'things', 'out', 'own', 'symbolism', 'blatant', 'shallowness', 'suburbia', 'where', 'quot', 'nothing', 'quot', 'nothing', 'new', 'other', 'films', 'have', 'probably', 'dealt', 'better', 'ways', 'American', 'Beauty', 'overcome', 'flaws', 'mostly', 'outstanding', 'performances', 'main', 'actors', 'especially', 'Spacey', 'Benning.Some', 'characters', 'especially', 'Ricky', 'dad', 'mom', 'occasionally', 'Benning', 'Mrs.', 'Burnham', 'are', 'little', 'underdeveloped', 'two-dimensional', 'Many', 'Thora', 'Birch', 'lines', 'Kevin', 'Spacey', 'seem', 'little', 'quot', 'stereotypical', 'quot', 'quot', 'angst-ridden', 'teen', 'quot', 'almost', 'push', 'boundaries', 'plausibility', 'especially', 'beginning', 'quot', 'ca', ""n't"", 'just', 'expect', 'be', 'best', 'friend', 'just', 'had', 'bad', 'day', 'work', 'quot', 'off', 'as', 'forced', 'matter', 'how', 'many', 'times', 'watch', 'nothing', 'special', 'cinematography', 'cgi-roses', 'are', 'almost', 'overused', 'tired', 'metaphor', 'end', 'film.American', 'Beauty', 'moving', 'disturbing', 'piece', 'filmmaking', 'put', 'heavy', 'philisophical', 'concepts', 'regarding', 'art', 'aesthetics', 'forms', 'average', 'Joe', 'can', 'understand', 'will', 'satisfy', 'even', 'who', 'feel', 'Hollywood', 'out', 'nothing', 'decent', 'anymore', 'Sit', 'back', 'enjoy', 'one', 'many', 'gems', 'Hollywood', 'turned', 'out', 'bumper', 'crop', 'good', 'films', 'last', 'year.DVD', 'Dirt', '-The', 'transfers', 'are', 'good', 'not', 'perfect', 'are', 'minor', 'black', 'lines', 'dots', 'film', 'especially', 'noticable', 'whenever', 'lot', 'color', 'screen', 'sound', 'little', 'quiet', 'well', 'commentary', 'supposedly', 'director', 'Sam', 'Mendes', 'writer', 'Alan', 'Ball', 'Ball', 'hardly', 'get', 'word', 'edgewise', 'Mendes', 'really', ""n't"", 'share', 'earth-shattering', 'insights', 'film', 'do', 'manage', 'talk', 'entire', 'time', 'refreshing', 'behind-the-scenes', 'featurette', 'OK', 'almost', 'filler', 'added', 'just', 'say', 'was', 'there', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'might', 'have', 'been', 'nice', 'especially', 'entire', 'original', 'introduction', 'guess', ""'ll"", 'have', 'wait']",Belleza Americana American Beauty  VHS

Okay so this movie was making a statement about what is wrong with America today, it's supposed to deal with the superficiality of the American suburbs, the hypocrisy of family today, blah blah blah. You get all of that within the first 5 minutes of the movie. The rest of it is all rose petals falling and an excuse pass off nudity as ""art"". At no point in this movie was it necessary to for us to see Mena Suvari's breasts. They were totally completely superfluous to the movie. But, hey, this movie is an ""artistic masterpiece"" so, therefore some nudity is required. Every single scene in this movie was the director screaming from the rooftops: ""look at me, I'm making an artistic movie and since many of us aspire to be 'intellectual', i.e. pretentious, we'll praise it because it's 'different' "". What was the point of this movie? Was he trying to get across a message that something is wrong with American society today? If so, he could have done it without Mena Suvari's breasts, the rose petals, and of course the most ""beautiful scene in the whole movie"" - I refer of course that oh-so-profound scene where the the marijuana-peddling voyeur neighbour says that the plastic bag flowing in the wind was so beautiful. Gosh, that statement had me almost emptying my stomach in the wrong way. Ok, I'll admit that at certain points in the movie, I had to laugh out loud, there was definitely some good humour, but most of this movie, was a useless, senseless, pretentious waste of film. So the director wanted to make the statement that something was wrong with society today. Tell me something I don't know. Look for the beauty in everyday life? Sure, but it wasn't anywhere in the movie. Compare this to another movie which wanted to bring home the tragedy of the twisted world we live in - Life is Beautiful. The director of that movie didn't need to show breasts, didn't even need to use curse words and what little violence there was was implied. Yet it brings home to all of us, how cruel and beautiful and complex human beings are. Another good movie which released around the same time - Fight Club. Also a very brilliantly done movie. The best way to get a social message across is subtlety. This movie was as subtle as sledgehammer. All this movie does is take the worst possible in all of us and put it onscreen. Either way, there was no reason for anybody to see Mena Suvari's breasts. Of course this review will just be voted least helpful, but hey, somebody had to be brave enough to criticize this movie.",1,This Doesn't Deserve ANY Awards....,1012521600,"02 1, 2002",2002,2645,"['course', 'review', 'will', 'be', 'small', 'voice', 'dissent', 'sea', 'praise', ""'m"", 'writing', 'few', 'who', 'will', 'listen', 'Okay', 'movie', 'was', 'making', 'statement', 'what', 'wrong', 'America', 'today', 'supposed', 'deal', 'superficiality', 'American', 'suburbs', 'hypocrisy', 'family', 'today', 'blah', 'blah', 'blah', 'get', 'first', '5', 'minutes', 'movie', 'rest', 'rose', 'petals', 'falling', 'excuse', 'pass', 'off', 'nudity', 'art', 'point', 'movie', 'was', 'necessary', 'see', 'Mena', 'Suvari', 'breasts', 'were', 'totally', 'completely', 'superfluous', 'movie', 'hey', 'movie', 'artistic', 'masterpiece', 'so', 'therefore', 'nudity', 'required', 'single', 'scene', 'movie', 'was', 'director', 'screaming', 'rooftops', 'look', ""'m"", 'making', 'artistic', 'movie', 'many', 'aspire', 'be', ""'intellectual"", 'i.e', 'pretentious', ""'ll"", 'praise', ""'different"", 'What', 'was', 'point', 'movie', 'Was', 'trying', 'get', 'message', 'something', 'wrong', 'American', 'society', 'today', 'so', 'could', 'have', 'done', 'Mena', 'Suvari', 'breasts', 'rose', 'petals', 'course', 'most', 'beautiful', 'scene', 'whole', 'movie', 'refer', 'course', 'oh-so-profound', 'scene', 'where', 'marijuana-peddling', 'voyeur', 'neighbour', 'plastic', 'bag', 'flowing', 'wind', 'was', 'so', 'beautiful', 'Gosh', 'statement', 'had', 'almost', 'emptying', 'stomach', 'wrong', 'way', 'Ok', ""'ll"", 'admit', 'certain', 'points', 'movie', 'had', 'laugh', 'out', 'loud', 'was', 'definitely', 'good', 'humour', 'most', 'movie', 'was', 'useless', 'senseless', 'pretentious', 'waste', 'film', 'director', 'wanted', 'make', 'statement', 'something', 'was', 'wrong', 'society', 'today', 'Tell', 'something', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'Look', 'beauty', 'everyday', 'life', 'Sure', 'was', ""n't"", 'anywhere', 'movie', 'Compare', 'movie', 'wanted', 'bring', 'home', 'tragedy', 'twisted', 'world', 'live', 'Life', 'Beautiful', 'director', 'movie', 'did', ""n't"", 'need', 'show', 'breasts', 'did', ""n't"", 'even', 'need', 'use', 'curse', 'words', 'what', 'little', 'violence', 'was', 'was', 'implied', 'home', 'how', 'cruel', 'beautiful', 'complex', 'human', 'beings', 'are', 'good', 'movie', 'released', 'same', 'time', 'Fight', 'Club', 'Also', 'very', 'brilliantly', 'done', 'movie', 'best', 'way', 'get', 'social', 'message', 'across', 'subtlety', 'movie', 'was', 'as', 'subtle', 'sledgehammer', 'movie', 'take', 'worst', 'possible', 'put', 'way', 'was', 'reason', 'anybody', 'see', 'Mena', 'Suvari', 'breasts', 'course', 'review', 'will', 'just', 'be', 'voted', 'least', 'helpful', 'hey', 'somebody', 'had', 'be', 'brave', 'enough', 'criticize', 'movie']",Belleza Americana American Beauty  VHS

He doesn't know it, and he doesn't tell you how he does.  From this point on, he pretty much tries to turn his life around from being miserable into being happy.

67654,A2KAVOGWK3BRB7,0783239408,"Jeffrey A. Veyera ""Jeff Veyera""","[9, 26]","Let's take a break from the sycophancy no doubt inherent in the reviews below (as in the media) and cast a critical eye on &quot;American  Beauty&quot;, shall we?The most useful method for conducting this  analysis is to compare it to the pro-American movie it slyly parodies,  &quot;Forrest Gump.&quot;  This is not the departure it may seem---a key  image from &quot;Beauty&quot;, a trashbag floating about the street, is  clearly a backhanded homage to the feather so prominent in  &quot;Gump.&quot; One of the main characters refers to this image of  wind-borne litter as the most beautiful thing he has ever seen, which  should confirm the skewed vision of the film.  This movie is the  anti-&quot;Gump&quot;.For those who don't recall, &quot;Gump&quot;  exploded on the scene in 1993, a pro-family, pro-South, pro-America,  pro-military movie which absolutely stunned the critics with its success.  It portrayed an America in which people were generally kind and decent, no  matter how conflicted and unhappy they could be from time to time, usually  through the prevalence of drugs, sex, and alcohol abuse.  In  &quot;Gump&quot;, the protagonist, though not hip or savvy, managed to  succeed merely by virtue of being a good man, eventually passing on his  homespun wisdom to his son.The success of this film no doubt made a  big impression on the creative forces behind &quot;American Beauty,&quot;  for they sought at every turn to craft a successful, critically-acclaimed  movie which would be the complete opposite to &quot;Gump&quot; in vision.In &quot;Beauty&quot;, the &quot;heroes&quot; are a middle-aged,  pot-smoking pedophile lusting after one of his 16-year-old daughter's  friends; his dealer, who happens to be dating his daughter; and the  daughter herself, a shrewish little girl who hates her parents (with some  reason).  The cast is rounded out by a homophobic, latent homosexual Marine  Colonel who happens to be the dealer's dad (how original for Hollywood);  the main character's hideous whore of a wife; and the only character in the  film with the least bit of humanity, the object of the protagonist's  perverse affection, played with great talent by Mena Suvari.The  movie's plot is an unholy mess, revolving around the protagonist's mid-life  crisis and how it brings about his demise.  This is merely a narrative  gimmick to allow the director to string together yet another series of  scenes depicting how life in the 'burbs is simply hell on earth.This  is typical Hollywood Baby Boomer drivel.  The only saving grace of this  movie is the fantastic performance of Mena Suvari, who brings brass and  vulnerability to the portrayal of her character, a normal girl amidst a  bunch of fools.

67656,A2V3P1XE33NYC3,0783239408,Jeffrey Leach,"[7, 13]","I am the first to admit I watch a lot of movies. In fact, I watch far more movies than the average person ever should. That I don't burn through DVD players every few months or wear eyeglasses the size of a mountaintop telescope is amazing considering I mix my movie experiences with healthy doses of reading and studying for my master's degree in history. I came to the conclusion long ago that I need my hour and a half a day movie to relieve stress. And since I avoid broadcast television like the plague, spending a couple of hours with a movie ensures I stay plugged into the all important pop culture conduits that crisscross every level of our society. Despite what most people say, movies and movie watching will tell you more about the world you live in than any other source of information. One need go no further than the movies, although I would recommend books as well, to understand the history of modern America. Take the 1990s, for example. No other film sums up the decade of political correctness, the Clintons, and the culture wars better than ""American Beauty."" How you look at this film depends entirely on your opinion of that decade.""American Beauty"" tells the story of the Burnham family, specifically patriarch Lester (Kevin Spacey), matriarch Carolyn (Annette Bening), and daughter Jane (Thora Birch). Set in a place the lunkheads in Hollywood hate with the heat of a million suns, suburbia, the movie begins with Lester speaking in voiceover. He tells us that he died, and he tells us that he will show us why he died. O.k., that's an interesting way to hook the viewer. And since Spacey's a pretty talented actor, I'll keep watching. The Burnham household is not a haven for happy campers. Lester slaves away all day at some phone/marketing job that he obviously hates. Wife Carolyn spends her time competing with Buddy Kane (Peter Gallagher) in the dog eat dog world of real estate. Jane Burnham is a teenager obviously unhappy with her physical appearance since we see her checking out plastic surgery sites on the Internet. Although the Burnham family does not yet know it, their lives are about to transform in significant ways. It all starts when Lester loses his position at the firm due to a restructuring. Fortunately for him, he knows some sordid information about his employer that allows him to walk out with a hefty severance package.Lester's change--let's call it a regression to the halcyon days of his youth--isn't due solely to his dismissal at work. Jane's attractive friend Angela Hayes (Mena Suvari) captured Lester's eye, and when he overhears her make a comment about how good looking he is, Burnham decides to embark on a radical regimen of weightlifting to improve his physique. Lester also takes a stand against his overbearing wife for the first time in years, which eventually drives Carolyn into the arms of an unlikely lover. In the meantime, Lester also buys a hotrod, finds a job at a fast food restaurant, and begins to dally in drugs with the help of neighborhood dealer and new next-door neighbor Ricky Fitts (Wes Bentley). Jane falls into the orbit of the enigmatic Ricky as well, and the two strike up a rather unusual relationship in which both can find solace from their emotional pain. Ricky's life is far from perfect; he must constantly deal with his physically and psychologically abusive former military officer father, referred to as the Colonel (Chris Cooper). The entire film centers on how these various people interact with one another.When ""American Beauty"" came out in 1999, we all heard the endless panegyrics praising every aspect of the picture. Those ""in the know"" proclaimed it a modern masterpiece, a sublime objet d'art that cut to the core of the modern American existence. Uh...no. I'll accept the argument that Kevin Spacey turned in a stellar performance as a man so tired of his dreary existence that he seeks refuge in the comfortable memories of his teenage years. I'll also accept the claim that Wes Bentley does a fine job in the difficult role of Ricky Fitts. I think all of the performers did a good job with their respective parts. But ""American Beauty"" as a modern masterpiece? An insightful look into the vacuous core of modern America? Sure, if you're a left-winger who thinks America is a horrible place to live. According to this film, if you're a member of a traditional American family living in the suburbs you will never be truly happy. You will never find fulfillment in anything you do because your existence is pretentious and emotionally stilted. Moreover, it's been a long time since I've seen a film that harbors this much hatred for the armed services. According to ""American Beauty,"" military men are pure evil because they collect guns, National Socialist regalia, physically abuse their family members, and are deeply hypocritical about very personal issues. The film makes sure that it draws a distinct connection between military service and these traits; it hits you over the head with it repeatedly. I could go on and on.Extras on this ""Award Edition"" DVD include behind the scenes stuff, a commentary track with the director and writer, storyboard presentations, two trailers, cast and crew biographies and filmographies, and production notes. I think I can still give the film three stars solely for the great performances, the even better score, and good atmosphere (love that opening shot swooping down the street). But I find the beating of chests and gnashing of teeth plotline about the destructive effects of suburbia banal and extraordinarily false.",3,Not ANOTHER film about surburbia!,1105056000,"01 7,

67657,ATS1HA5M3EPZ4,0783239408,"J. Elmquist ""Moviephile""","[0, 5]","If this movie is about dysfunction, then the creators have succeeded.  They have displayed that dysfunction can range from non-communication to drug dealing to murder.  In the end, the message is unclear and somewhat alarming.I can't say I hated this movie, but it is not what I call entertaining.  The story of a suburban neighborhood and it's off the wall residents does not ring very true with most of my experiences but writer Alan Ball and director Sam Mendes seem to want us to believe that what happens is fairly normal.  Maybe I mis-read their message.  Maybe they have no message.  It's possible that they're painting a scenario in which two dysfunctional families are thrust into each other's lives and the combination of certain elements (repressed gay father, drug dealing son, isolated daughter and her mid-life crisis suffering dad) is the catalyst for several events that normally would NOT happen on the typical suburban street.In any case and for the most part, I don't think the writer's story of these circumstances is a perception of real life.  It may be his perception as he grew up, but perception is relevant.  His perceptions may have been born out of his life growing up and what he experienced.  Between this movie and his work with the HBO show Six Feet Under, I have to draw the conclusion that he not only has an obsession with death, but he might be gay himself.  Please don't go off in a tizzy, there's nothing wrong with being gay.  But these days, gay people suffer hatred of those intolerant and his writing may be a reflection of the intolerance he has experienced.  Most writers write from what they know, and this may be no exception.But I could be wrong as well.  He may be just writing about gay people, in which he has written some very good work, exploring them as humans and their different facets.  We have a perfectly normal gay couple living on the street, as well as a gay father who is repressing his own homosexual tendencies.Kevin Spacey plays his role very well.  From the beginning we are made full aware of his daily anguish that he goes through trying to deal with his life.  What I don't like is the way irresponsibility is displayed as acceptable, and even praised behavior.  The creators are trying to make me believe it ok that a father can just quit his job to chase his youthful dreams.  It makes me really mad that the young teenager who is selling drugs is the one we are supposed to see as the hero when he comes knocking on the door of his girlfriends house telling her he wants to take her away to Amsterdam.  Do we think they are going just for the history?  No.This is my biggest problem with this film, that I can't see any reason to like any of the characters.  Relating to them is liking them.  No one seems to think they can be held accountable for their actions, and I cannot relate to that at all.  There are consequences to everything we do, good and bad.  And no one in this film seems to have consideration for those around them, and the story does not display this, except when you turn down the advances of a homosexual neighbor, then you may be shot in the head.I mentioned before that I believe Alan Ball has may have an obsession with death, and if his writing is a message about living life to fullest before we die, then fine, I can understand that.  But life is about balance, and balance requires a dose of reality and doing what needs to be done as well as what wants to be done.  I'm sure we would all like to save time by not eating or sleeping, but we have to do it...or else we die.Let me end on a good note; the movie is very well acted and photographed.  The performances by Spacey and Birch are top notch and Chris Cooper is always reliable as well.  The movie is watchable, if not a little slow at times.  In all, I would say it's a good movie, if you like movies that have no redeemable characters and there is no good that comes from the story.  Please don't misunderstand, there is nothing wrong with this type of movie, it just isn't entertaining for me, and that is just my opinion, even if it is unpopular.",3,Not a 'pretty' movie,1101081600,"11 22, 2004",2004,4106,"['movie', 'dysfunction', 'then', 'creators', 'have', 'succeeded', 'have', 'displayed', 'dysfunction', 'can', 'range', 'non-communication', 'drug', 'dealing', 'murder', 'end', 'message', 'unclear', 'somewhat', 'alarming.I', 'ca', ""n't"", 'say', 'hated', 'movie', 'not', 'what', 'call', 'entertaining', 'story', 'suburban', 'neighborhood', 'wall', 'residents', 'not', 'ring', 'very', 'true', 'most', 'experiences', 'writer', 'Alan', 'Ball', 'director', 'Sam', 'Mendes', 'seem', 'want', 'believe', 'what', 'fairly', 'normal', 'Maybe', 'mis-read', 'message', 'Maybe', 'have', 'message', 'possible', ""'re"", 'painting', 'scenario', 'two', 'dysfunctional', 'families', 'are', 'thrust', 'other', 'lives', 'combination', 'certain', 'elements', 'repressed', 'gay', 'father', 'drug', 'dealing', 'son', 'isolated', 'daughter', 'mid-life', 'crisis', 'suffering', 'dad', 'catalyst', 'several', 'events', 'normally', 'would', 'NOT', 'happen', 'typical', 'suburban', 'street.In', 'case', 'most', 'part', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'writer', 'story', 'circumstances', 'perception', 'real', 'life', 'may', 'be', 'perception', 'grew', 'up', 'perception', 'relevant', 'perceptions', 'may', 'have', 'been', 'born', 'life', 'growing', 'up', 'what', 'experienced', 'movie', 'work', 'HBO', 'show', 'Six', 'Feet', 'have', 'draw', 'conclusion', 'not', 'only', 'obsession', 'death', 'might', 'be', 'gay', 'Please', 'do', ""n't"", 'go', 'off', 'tizzy', 'nothing', 'wrong', 'being', 'gay', 'days', 'gay', 'people', 'suffer', 'hatred', 'intolerant', 'writing', 'may', 'be', 'reflection', 'intolerance', 'experienced', 'Most', 'writers', 'write', 'what', 'know', 'may', 'be', 'exception.But', 'could', 'be', 'wrong', 'as', 'well', 'may', 'be', 'just', 'writing', 'gay', 'people', 'written', 'very', 'good', 'work', 'exploring', 'humans', 'different', 'facets', 'have', 'perfectly', 'normal', 'gay', 'couple', 'living', 'street', 'as', 'well', 'gay', 'father', 'who', 'repressing', 'own', 'homosexual', 'tendencies.Kevin', 'Spacey', 'role', 'very', 'well', 'beginning', 'are', 'made', 'full', 'aware', 'daily', 'anguish', 'trying', 'deal', 'life', 'What', 'do', ""n't"", 'like', 'way', 'irresponsibility', 'displayed', 'acceptable', 'even', 'praised', 'behavior', 'creators', 'are', 'trying', 'make', 'believe', 'ok', 'father', 'can', 'just', 'quit', 'job', 'chase', 'youthful', 'dreams', 'really', 'young', 'teenager', 'who', 'selling', 'drugs', 'one', 'are', 'supposed', 'see', 'hero', 'when', 'knocking', 'door', 'girlfriends', 'house', 'telling', 'take', 'away', 'Amsterdam', 'Do', 'think', 'are', 'going', 'just', 'history', 'No.This', 'biggest', 'problem', 'film', 'ca', ""n't"", 'see', 'reason', 'like', 'characters', 'Relating', 'liking', 'one', 'think', 'can', 'be', 'held', 'accountable', 'actions', 'can', 'not', 'relate', 'are', 'consequences', 'everything', 'do', 'good', 'bad', 'one', 'film', 'have', 'consideration', 'story', 'not', 'display', 'when', 'turn', 'down', 'advances', 'homosexual', 'neighbor', 'then', 'may', 'be', 'shot', 'head.I', 'mentioned', 'believe', 'Alan', 'Ball', 'may', 'have', 'obsession', 'death', 'writing', 'message', 'living', 'life', 'fullest', 'die', 'then', 'fine', 'can', 'understand', 'life', 'balance', 'balance', 'dose', 'reality', 'doing', 'what', 'be', 'done', 'as', 'well', 'what', 'be', 'done', ""'m"", 'sure', 'would', 'save', 'time', 'not', 'eating', 'sleeping', 'have', 'do', 'else', 'die.Let', 'end', 'good', 'note', 'movie', 'very', 'well', 'acted', 'photographed', 'performances', 'Spacey', 'Birch', 'are', 'top', 'notch', 'Chris', 'Cooper', 'always', 'reliable', 'as', 'well', 'movie', 'watchable', 'not', 'little', 'slow', 'times', 'would', 'say', 'good', 'movie', 'like', 'movies', 'have', 'redeemable', 'characters', 'good', 'story', 'Please', 'do', ""n't"", 'misunderstand', 'nothing', 'wrong', 'type', 'movie', 'just', ""n't"", 'entertaining', 'just', 'opinion', 'even', 'unpopular']",Belleza Americana American Beauty  VHS

Kevin Spacey shines as Lester Burnham, and Annette Bening (Carolyn Burnham) isn't far behind. Supporting cast members such as Wes Bentley (Ricky Fitts), Thora Birch (Jane Burnham), Mena Suvari (Angela Hayes), and Chris Cooper (Col. Frank Fitts) only adds to the drama of this film. I think the most special aspect of this film is how all of the characters intertwine in a way that is believable, yet fantastic at the same time. I congratulate Sam Mendes for his direction of this film, as well as Alan Ball for writing it. I don't think it could have been any better.Rated R in the U.S. for strong sexuality, language, drug content, and violence, the film obviously deserves its rating. However, none of the causes for the R rating are overbearing, and all of them add to the plot-line of this film. While I don't think that this is a film for children, I would suggest that adults should view it with an open mind. I believe that the traits which many of the characters in this film have are found in many people around the world.

It's one of the freshest, funniest and ultimately up-lifting stories about a murder you'll ever see.Kevin Spacey plays Lester Burnham, a man whose last name should be &quot;Burn-out-&quot; until he catches a glimpse of his daughter's sexy friend. This inspires Lester to go on a rampage of self-improvement. Spacey's a wonder in this role- from his droll voice-over to his character's biting sarcasm. But the performance of the film has to be Annette Bening as Lester's shallow, ambitious, materialistic, real estate agent wife. Bening is by turns falsely charming, overly needy, self-loathing and domineering, but finds vulnerability and believability in a role that, in a lesser film and with a lesser performer, would've become a cartoon. She makes a worthy sparring partner for Spacey. Complicating matters are the Burnham's weirder-than-weird next-door neighbors; Chris Cooper is ferocious as the homophobic Col. Fitts and Wes Bentley plays his son, the videophile with a troubled past who sells pot to the revitalized Lester. Bentley also gets involved in a touching romance with Thora Birch as Lester's daughter.&quot;American Beauty&quot; moves in mysterious ways, teases the viewer with several possible outcomes before ending in violence, but with a strangely serene and entrancing coda that will literally make you feel a whole lot better- sort of like Lester himself. This is a very worthy film that cuts right to the heart of suburban malaise and materialism and finds spiritual lessons and bittersweet humor even in its smallest moments. With Mena Suvari as the trash-talking sexpot friend Lester obsesses over, and &quot;Quantam Leap's&quot; Scott Bakula as neighbor Jim who lives with his lover, Jim.

67675,ACZ6J3L2C0IZ6,0783239408,"John Cardenas ""opera nut""","[6, 9]","As hyped this year as La Vita e Bella and Shakespeare in Love were last, American Beauty is not without its wry moments and twisted charm; much of it, however, is a simplification of cliches about suburbia: i.e., mindless  affluence, spiritual malaise, and the lust for status.  No one seems to  have pointed out the obvious irony--the fact that Hollywood, a community  known for its mindless affluence, spiritual malaise, and lust for status,  has heaped awards all over this movie.  This movie is hip in its  condescension to the suburbs and yet the swank interiors are chilly  approved of as in a Merchant Ivory film. And when the big moments of  revelation come, they either feel fake (the young cheerleader's insecurity  and self-doubt), smugly juvenile (the young couple's assertion of their  moral superiority over their parents and suburbia, which they are desperate  to escape [to New York--not exactly an original choice]), or like stale  Freudianisms (the martinet ex-marine neighbor's sexual repression).  The  filmmakers congratulate themselves for rising above all this gross  materialism and wealth, and yet have themselves reaped as their reward for  this expose of the empty lives of the bourgeois classes wealth and  notoriety.  The movie does have its moments of visual poetry and some  sharply written scenes, but the overall effect is limp, barren.  This is,  of course, the theme of the movie.  It only partially works thanks to Kevin  Spacey, who fills his role with humor and a hangdog, loser charm.  He's  playing a baby-boomer fantasy of thumbing one's nose at the system and  retreating into adolescent irresponsibility.  The movie asks us to see him  as wiser, as hip in his way as the disaffected young kids are (although  their hipness is of a rather glacial, castigating variety).  But the  conflicts in this movie are simplified: Annette Bening's caricature of a  materialistic, power-hungry harpy makes Spacey's choice less than heroic,  for who wouldn't want to leave her and to reject all that she stands for?  Do the English director and his New York cohorts think that this movie  represents the dirty truth of American suburban life?

People who can't take off their &quot;dumb&quot; glasses for long enough to see the poignancy of this movie should go back to high school, or at least take  some interpretation course. The producers of this movie are not GLORIFYING  or HERALDING underage sex and the like; how does one get the idea that they  enjoy these or something? American Beauty is the best movie of 1999, if not  the decade, and is the epitome of a blend of comedy, insight, and  poignance. The reason this movie is either loved or hated yields one simple  explanation; American Beauty holds a mirror in front of most families in  the nation, and some just cannot take this. Annette Bening shined as  Carolyn Burnham, but the set was eclipsed by the utter brilliance of Kevin  Spacey. His dry humor and outlook on life are amazing and unequaled in  film. I believe Birch should have been given more credit for her role as  Jane Burnham as well; she portrayed a teenager so similar to many today.

Perez ""Jose""","[2, 6]","To be sure, &quot;American Beauty&quot; will strike some viewers as weird and moribund, but no film before it or since prepares one for its utter familiarity as it hits closer to home than most anyone I know expected.  While not every character here feels identical to anyone I know (and thats a good thing, trust me) more often than not, Spacey and Bening are stand-ins for our friends, neighbors, families and even - ourselves.  The simple theme that &quot;everything is not as it seems on the outside&quot; carries tremendous weight, and I dare the viewer to not see themselves and the people they know behind the curtain that separates truth from fantasy.  Kevin Spacey proves why he is THE actor of our generation, while Menu Suvari, Wes Bentley and Thora Birch cast vivid characters likely roaming our neighborhood high school at this very moment.  The four are uniformly grand.However, this is Annette Bening's shining moment.  Nothing this actress has done before prepared me for a monumental performance that literally shook me to the core.  She is at once in control of all around her and yet desperate to experience her own truest self, free from what she knows, who she lives with, and where she is headed.  Bening captures her character's soul and sends it to the stratosphere, long suffering one moment, and kissing up the next.  Her scenes with the &quot;King of Real Estate&quot; show a desparate range of emotion.  Bening deserved the Oscar, though in a year dominated by Hilary Swank's superlative &quot;Boys Don't Cry&quot; Bening was a deserved first runner up.A movie that actually makes you think twice about your own existence and how your actions affect the world around you in  unexpected ways.",5,Brilliant All Around,992908800,"06 19, 2001",2001,1719,"['be', 'sure', 'quot', 'American', 'Beauty', 'quot', 'will', 'strike', 'viewers', 'weird', 'moribund', 'film', 'prepares', 'one', 'utter', 'familiarity', 'closer', 'home', 'most', 'anyone', 'know', 'expected', 'not', 'character', 'here', 'identical', 'anyone', 'know', 'good', 'thing', 'trust', 'more', 'often', 'not', 'Spacey', 'Bening', 'are', 'stand-ins', 'friends', 'neighbors', 'families', 'even', 'simple', 'theme', 'quot', 'everything', 'not', 'outside', 'quot', 'tremendous', 'weight', 'dare', 'viewer', 'not', 'see', 'people', 'know', 'curtain', 'truth', 'fantasy', 'Kevin', 'Spacey', 'why', 'actor', 'generation', 'Menu', 'Suvari', 'Wes', 'Bentley', 'Thora', 'Birch', 'cast', 'vivid', 'characters', 'likely', 'roaming', 'neighborhood', 'high', 'school', 'very', 'moment', 'four', 'are', 'uniformly', 'grand.However', 'Annette', 'Bening', 'shining', 'moment', 'Nothing', 'actress', 'done', 'before', 'prepared', 'monumental', 'performance', 'literally', 'shook', 'core', 'once', 'control', 'yet', 'desperate', 'experience', 'own', 'truest', 'self', 'free', 'what', 'who', 'where', 'headed', 'Bening', 'character', 'soul', 'stratosphere', 'long', 'suffering', 'one', 'moment', 'kissing', 'up', 'next', 'scenes', 'quot', 'King', 'Real', 'Estate', 'quot', 'show', 'desparate', 'range', 'emotion', 'Bening', 'deserved', 'Oscar', 'though', 'year', 'dominated', 'Hilary', 'Swank', 'superlative', 'quot', 'Boys', 'Do', ""n't"", 'Cry', 'quot', 'Bening', 'was', 'deserved', 'first', 'runner', 'up.A', 'movie', 'actually', 'think', 'twice', 'own', 'existence', 'how', 'actions', 'affect', 'world', 'unexpected', 'ways']",Belleza Americana American Beauty  VHS

Remington ""John Remington""","[3, 4]","""They call me the seeker,I keep searching low and high.I won't get to get what I'm after,Till the day I die!""Pete Townshend- ""The Seeker""Les Birnam (Kevin Spacey), a man who has lost his  fire and passion for living slowly rots in a  job that consists of being nothing more than a meaningless cipher buried in a catacomb of desks in a bland office. His life vacillates in abuse between  his success obsessed wife (Annette Benning) and his incommunicado teenage daughter. He even tells us in the opening few seconds that he has recently been killed, but then again, he had been dead for years and didn't even know it.Such is the beginning of Lester's search for rebirth in the satirically focused, poignantly funny and ultimately tragic contemporary film masterpiece ""American Beauty"".Borrowing from his idol Billy Wilder, British theatre director Sam Mendes makes a controversial and riveting film debut bringing visual life to screenwriter Allan Ball's superb script. Working with the brilliant visual artist Conrad Hall, Ball incorperates vivid imagery, clever framing and careful pacing to create a work of art without the least suggestion of pretension.Mendes utilizes his intense  live theatrical training and follows to rule number one of directing: relate a clear narrative in an interesting manner that serves the script.  Unlike many young filmmakers, he achieves rule number one while also obeying rule number two: select images that enhance the narrative while making the director invisible.The cast and crew deserve full marks (and, now as a postscript- the Oscar) for creating a movie that tells a clear story populated with characters we somehow care about. This is no mean feat considering that in lesser and exploitive hands the shallow suburbanites who populate the film could easily have become despised one dimensional cut-outs; or even worse yet, in the cameras of a self important visual wizard (think Terrance Malick or Stanley Kubrick), an obscure and distant philosophical tome.Also richly deserving the Oscar, screenwriter Allan Ball's script plays like an economical novel as there isn't a wasted scene or extraneous bit of dialogue. The dialogue itself breathes fully and truthfully as a living organism as Ball exposes every honest wart of behavior. It also allows Lester to achieve a sense of redemption at the very end of the film as he ultimately makes a moral decision and chooses the right, thereby enabling himself to ""walk into his house justified"" .Ball's characters are people who's obsessions and secrets lead them on a treasure seeking journey celebrating the beautiful frailty that is the human being. Although we the audience, may not desire to admit it, we certainly see either ourselves or our neighbors on the screen.Understand, that this movie is certainly not for everyone. Some certainly will find it dark, cynical and in bad taste. Others, like this reviewer, an insightful, entertaining and memorable experience. Audiences viewing this film will split into such opposing camps. No one, I believe, will say ""Oh, it was okay, I guess.""Such a easily quotable odyssey of a film that polarizes an audience is richly deserving of a look.

67692,A3OP9CU8GUWI03,0783239408,"J. Ridgway ""Ridge""","[1, 3]","It's BOTH.  It's a well-scripted, contrived and slick piece of film propaganda that's acted out by talented actors.I really loath this movie, despite the fact that it is entertaining and won an Oscar.  I loath the fact that it is so manipulative.  I hate the fact that very talented people created a script that has such a depressing and hateful ""moral"" agenda. This movie is very Alinsky-ite to me.  It is cynical to the fifth power, and all its cynicism is directed towards breaking down our repect for the American middle-class nuclear family, as well as other institutions such as free-market businesses and the American military.  American Beauty almost drips with hatred at the white, suburban American family.  Everyone in the movie is selfish and pathetic, except of course, the neighborhood gay couple, who are charming, well-adjusted and happy!  Everything is so contrived and absolutely manipulative.  I can't see why people like it, honestly, unless they just remove their moral sense and totally give in to the movie-makers' agenda.I loath the fact that the protagonist's (Kevin Spacey) daughter seems to care so little about her father, near the end of the movie (more on that below), and loath even more the depiction of the toxic family that her boyfriend/neighbor has.  I hate the poisonous way that the American Job is depicted: either a cynical place that Spacey's character extorts for severance pay, or a depressing place where his wife chases a big Real Estate score and then has an affair with her boss.  Inexperienced and impressionable people who watch this movie may be dissuaded into working for the private sector, and instead seek out paper-pushing bureaucratic jobs in government, because of the toxic nature in which private business is portrayed.  (And NOW we see that private sector jobs are steadily shrinking -- and do YOU things getting better or worse?)  Young people may watch the poisonous and loveless families in this movie and not want to get married or form families (And NOW we see that nuclear families are steadily shrinking, with a tsunami of single-parent families dependent on the government -- and do YOU think things getting better or worse?)&lt; Spoilers Below >The absolute worst part of the movie shows the pot-smoking neighbor boy being browbeaten and physically abused by his over-the-top ex-Colonel father.  The writers then make the Colonel, who warns his son against ""going gay"", out to have secret gay tendencies.  Let me tell you, I guarantee that men who have risen to Colonel in the Army or Marines are quality people and not this kind of pathetic, loveless, dead-end hypocrite depicted here.  I guarantee that the vast majority of families with fathers in the military are good families where their kids love their parents, and their Mom and Dad love each other.  NOT in this propaganda film!  And of course, the adults in the movie are slaves to their sex drives:  Spacey wants to bed his daughter's hot cheerleader friend, his wife has an affair with her boss, and the Colonel wants to act out his homosexual urges.  In the liberal world, sex is our God and we are just helpless pawns to it!There is one scene that I like in the movie where Spacey becomes an adult, but it's followed by a scene of utter loathsomeness.  The one good scene is where Spacey gets his big chance with his daughter's friend, he discovers that she's a virgin, and then he refuses to go through with her sexual molestation, and instead comforts her.  Then unfortunately, he is shot in the head (by whom I won't say).  After he is shot (in his own house), I hate it that the writers show his own daughter simply looking at him with cold amazement, with less emotion than she would have if a dog got killed.  Absolutely no love for her father is shown. No family bond or warmth.  (VERY unrealistic and loathsome. Think if your father got shot!)  Are American teens so much into themselves that they wouldn't even mourn the murder of their own father??? I don't think so, but the cynical writers of this film think so.  Utter cynicism and poisonous contempt of the basic building block of our society:  the American Nuclear Family.So in summary, American Beauty is an engaging yet loathsome piece of propaganda, in which its creators slickly pedal the tenents of their destructive, Alinskyite values:  a) the American Family is a loveless sham; b) all adults are slaves of their sex drives; c) the Military, and the values of discipline that the Military believes in, is to be trashed; and d) Free-Market private enterprise is a corrupt institution and likewise to be trashed.",2,Is it Art or anti-American Propaganda?,1253577600,"09 22, 2009",2009,4615,"['BOTH', 'well-scripted', 'contrived', 'slick', 'piece', 'film', 'propaganda', 'acted', 'out', 'talented', 'actors.I', 'really', 'loath', 'movie', 'fact', 'entertaining', 'won', 'Oscar', 'loath', 'fact', 'so', 'manipulative', 'hate', 'fact', 'very', 'talented', 'people', 'created', 'script', 'depressing', 'hateful', 'moral', 'agenda', 'movie', 'very', 'Alinsky-ite', 'cynical', 'fifth', 'power', 'cynicism', 'directed', 'breaking', 'down', 'repect', 'American', 'middle-class', 'nuclear', 'family', 'as', 'well', 'other', 'institutions', 'such', 'free-market', 'businesses', 'American', 'military', 'American', 'Beauty', 'almost', 'hatred', 'white', 'suburban', 'American', 'family', 'Everyone', 'movie', 'selfish', 'pathetic', 'course', 'neighborhood', 'gay', 'couple', 'who', 'are', 'charming', 'well-adjusted', 'happy', 'Everything', 'so', 'contrived', 'absolutely', 'manipulative', 'ca', ""n't"", 'see', 'why', 'people', 'honestly', 'just', 'remove', 'moral', 'sense', 'totally', 'give', 'movie-makers', 'agenda.I', 'loath', 'fact', 'protagonist', 'Kevin', 'Spacey', 'daughter', 'care', 'so', 'little', 'father', 'end', 'movie', 'more', 'below', 'loath', 'even', 'more', 'depiction', 'toxic', 'family', 'boyfriend/neighbor', 'hate', 'poisonous', 'way', 'American', 'Job', 'depicted', 'cynical', 'place', 'Spacey', 'character', 'extorts', 'severance', 'pay', 'depressing', 'place', 'where', 'wife', 'big', 'Real', 'Estate', 'score', 'then', 'affair', 'boss', 'Inexperienced', 'impressionable', 'people', 'who', 'watch', 'movie', 'may', 'be', 'dissuaded', 'working', 'private', 'sector', 'instead', 'seek', 'out', 'paper-pushing', 'bureaucratic', 'jobs', 'government', 'toxic', 'nature', 'private', 'business', 'portrayed', 'NOW', 'see', 'private', 'sector', 'jobs', 'are', 'steadily', 'shrinking', 'do', 'YOU', 'things', 'getting', 'better', 'worse', 'people', 'may', 'watch', 'poisonous', 'loveless', 'families', 'movie', 'not', 'want', 'get', 'married', 'form', 'families', 'NOW', 'see', 'nuclear', 'families', 'are', 'steadily', 'shrinking', 'tsunami', 'single-parent', 'families', 'dependent', 'government', 'do', 'YOU', 'think', 'things', 'getting', 'better', 'worse', 'lt', 'Spoilers', 'Below', '>', 'absolute', 'worst', 'part', 'movie', 'pot-smoking', 'neighbor', 'boy', 'being', 'browbeaten', 'physically', 'abused', 'over-the-top', 'ex-Colonel', 'father', 'writers', 'then', 'make', 'Colonel', 'who', 'son', 'going', 'gay', 'have', 'secret', 'gay', 'tendencies', 'Let', 'tell', 'guarantee', 'men', 'who', 'have', 'risen', 'Colonel', 'Army', 'Marines', 'are', 'quality', 'people', 'not', 'kind', 'pathetic', 'loveless', 'dead-end', 'hypocrite', 'depicted', 'here', 'guarantee', 'vast', 'majority', 'families', 'fathers', 'military', 'are', 'good', 'families', 'where', 'kids', 'love', 'parents', 'Mom', 'Dad', 'love', 'other', 'NOT', 'propaganda', 'film', 'course', 'adults', 'movie', 'are', 'slaves', 'sex', 'drives', 'Spacey', 'bed', 'daughter', 'hot', 'cheerleader', 'friend', 'wife', 'affair', 'boss', 'Colonel', 'act', 'out', 'homosexual', 'urges', 'liberal', 'world', 'sex', 'God', 'are', 'just', 'helpless', 'pawns', 'one', 'scene', 'like', 'movie', 'where', 'Spacey', 'adult', 'followed', 'scene', 'utter', 'loathsomeness', 'one', 'good', 'scene', 'where', 'Spacey', 'big', 'chance', 'daughter', 'friend', 'virgin', 'then', 'go', 'sexual', 'molestation', 'instead', 'Then', 'unfortunately', 'shot', 'head', 'whom', 'wo', ""n't"", 'say', 'shot', 'own', 'house', 'hate', 'writers', 'show', 'own', 'daughter', 'simply', 'looking', 'cold', 'amazement', 'less', 'emotion', 'would', 'have', 'dog', 'got', 'killed', 'Absolutely', 'love', 'father', 'shown', 'family', 'bond', 'warmth', 'VERY', 'unrealistic', 'loathsome', 'Think', 'father', 'got', 'shot', 'Are', 'American', 'teens', 'so', 'much', 'would', ""n't"", 'even', 'mourn', 'murder', 'own', 'father', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'so', 'cynical', 'writers', 'film', 'think', 'so', 'Utter', 'cynicism', 'poisonous', 'contempt', 'basic', 'building', 'block', 'society', 'American', 'Nuclear', 'Family.So', 'summary', 'American', 'Beauty', 'engaging', 'yet', 'loathsome', 'piece', 'propaganda', 'creators', 'slickly', 'tenents', 'destructive', 'Alinskyite', 'American', 'Family', 'loveless', 'sham', 'adults', 'are', 'slaves', 'sex', 'drives', 'c', 'Military', 'values', 'discipline', 'Military', 'be', 'trashed', 'd', 'Free-Market', 'private', 'enterprise', 'corrupt', 'institution', 'likewise', 'be', 'trashed']",Belleza Americana American Beauty  VHS

American Beauty is a film that takes my breath away each time I watch it, and every time I do watch it, I notice something newer, something more exciting and something more funny. There is honestly no other movie like this, and if you haven't seen it, there is something donged in your head, and you must do so now.Lester Burnham (Kevin Spacey) is in a mid-life crisis, caused by his stressed wife Carolyn (Annette Bening) and rebelling teenage daughter Jane (Thora Birch). When Lester and Carolyn go watch Jane cheerleading, they meet Angela Hayes (Mena Suvari), and Lester, caught in sudden lust for Angela, decides to change his life. Angela and Jane's friendship is not all it seems, too, because Angela only brags about how many times she's done it with guys and stuff. That doesn't help an already insecure Jane very much but she finds solace in the arms of the next-door-neighbours' son, Ricky Fitts (Wes Bentley). Ricky, himself from a broken home as well, and Jane find they have a lot in common and eventually turn out to be soulmates.Everything about this film is so darkly clear, it is extremely obvious why the Academy loved it, and it is very obvious to see that I love it. Spacey brings Lester wildly to life in a performance reminiscent of Spacey's acting coach Jack Lemmon. Also on top form is Annette Bening, in an over-controlled performance that is just so instantly loveable. While all the attention went to these performers, it is also Thora Birch (especially), Mena Suvari, Wes Bentley and a quiet Allison Janney that manage to steal the show just as much. Sam Mendes is an excellent director, this is his first feature, and he is a British man directing an American-based film! And he won an Oscar for it! That's an amazing achievement, ditto to Alan Ball, who's script is effectively a stunner and an instant winner.The best film of 1999, the best film of the decade and for now anyways, American Beauty stands tall as the best film ever made.",5,A dark and stunning masterpiece.,984787200,"03 17, 2001",2001,2019,"['American', 'BeautyScore', '99/100Wow', 'mean', 'American', 'Beauty', 'film', 'breath', 'away', 'time', 'watch', 'time', 'do', 'watch', 'notice', 'something', 'newer', 'something', 'more', 'exciting', 'something', 'more', 'funny', 'honestly', 'other', 'movie', 'have', ""n't"", 'seen', 'something', 'donged', 'head', 'must', 'do', 'so', 'now.Lester', 'Burnham', 'Kevin', 'Spacey', 'mid-life', 'crisis', 'caused', 'stressed', 'wife', 'Carolyn', 'Annette', 'Bening', 'rebelling', 'teenage', 'daughter', 'Jane', 'Thora', 'Birch', 'When', 'Lester', 'Carolyn', 'go', 'watch', 'Jane', 'cheerleading', 'meet', 'Angela', 'Hayes', 'Mena', 'Suvari', 'Lester', 'caught', 'sudden', 'lust', 'Angela', 'change', 'life', 'Angela', 'Jane', 'friendship', 'not', 'too', 'Angela', 'only', 'how', 'many', 'times', 'done', 'guys', 'stuff', ""n't"", 'help', 'already', 'insecure', 'Jane', 'very', 'much', 'solace', 'arms', 'next-door-neighbours', 'son', 'Ricky', 'Fitts', 'Wes', 'Bentley', 'Ricky', 'broken', 'home', 'as', 'well', 'Jane', 'find', 'have', 'lot', 'common', 'eventually', 'turn', 'out', 'be', 'soulmates.Everything', 'film', 'so', 'darkly', 'clear', 'extremely', 'obvious', 'why', 'Academy', 'loved', 'very', 'obvious', 'see', 'love', 'Spacey', 'Lester', 'wildly', 'life', 'performance', 'reminiscent', 'Spacey', 'acting', 'coach', 'Jack', 'Lemmon', 'Also', 'top', 'form', 'Annette', 'Bening', 'over-controlled', 'performance', 'just', 'so', 'instantly', 'loveable', 'attention', 'went', 'performers', 'also', 'Thora', 'Birch', 'especially', 'Mena', 'Suvari', 'Wes', 'Bentley', 'quiet', 'Allison', 'Janney', 'manage', 'steal', 'show', 'just', 'as', 'much', 'Sam', 'Mendes', 'excellent', 'director', 'first', 'feature', 'British', 'man', 'directing', 'American-based', 'film', 'won', 'Oscar', 'amazing', 'achievement', 'ditto', 'Alan', 'Ball', 'who', 'script', 'effectively', 'stunner', 'instant', 'winner.The', 'best', 'film', '1999', 'best', 'film', 'decade', 'now', 'American', 'Beauty', 'tall', 'best', 'film', 'ever', 'made']",Belleza Americana American Beauty  VHS

Cut next to the Father, who announces that he will be dead a year from now  -- he intones this while doing something unmentionable  (on Amazon)  in the  shower.  Flashy enough for you?  When the story lacks substance, wow them  with  &quot;cleverness&quot;.  And this story, folks, does indeed lack  substance:  making middle-aged suburban angst into art is beyond even the  most scrupulous talents, I daresay.  Therefore, we're submitted to weird  tricks such as rose petals cascading from a cheerleader's blouse.  Not only  does this cheap trick waste time, it's dishonest:  why can't we see what  the Spacey character is REALLY thinking about?  In my opinion, the roses  thing is a cop-out; the film lacks the courage of its convictions; but who  wants a NC-17 rating?  No theaters screen NC-17 films, and NC-17 films  never win Oscars.Kevin Spacey, despite using all his Kevin-Spacey-Shtik  (droll expressions, world-weary murmur, et al.), is the character we most  care about, but, as I'm intimating, no thanks to him.  Considering the  ponderous denouement, his facile interpretation isn't really called for --  we need a more serious performance.  The other characters are cartoons:  The Termagant Wife, the Spooky Teenager  (there are several), the Repressed  Homosexual.To finish: despite its slick attempt at  &quot;sophistication&quot;, e.g., the Floating Trash Bag, the Rose Petals,  the Voice from the Grave, this is a very mainstream tale told in a  surprisingly average way.  Besides all that, the actors chew the scenery  (Bening's blubbering, Spacey snapping his wrists as he hands over a bag of  burgers).  All this has been done before -- I just don't know what all the  fuss is about.  &quot;American Beauty&quot;  has some merits, but it ain't  no  &quot;Lolita&quot;.",2,More mainstream than it thinks.,952387200,"03 7, 2000",2000,2075,"['opinion', 'film', 'will', 'differ', 'everyone', 'else', 'agreed', 'how', 'fun', 'would', 'be', 'Right', 'opening', 'scene', ""'re"", 'meant', 'be', 'impressed', 'camcorder', 'image', 'teenage', 'girl', 'talking', 'sullenly', 'murdering', 'quot', 'geek', 'boy', 'father', 'quot', 'Cut', 'next', 'Father', 'who', 'will', 'be', 'dead', 'year', 'now', 'doing', 'something', 'unmentionable', 'Amazon', 'shower', 'Flashy', 'enough', 'When', 'story', 'substance', 'wow', 'quot', 'cleverness', 'quot', 'story', 'folks', 'indeed', 'lack', 'substance', 'making', 'middle-aged', 'suburban', 'angst', 'art', 'even', 'most', 'scrupulous', 'talents', 'daresay', 'Therefore', ""'re"", 'submitted', 'weird', 'tricks', 'such', 'rose', 'petals', 'cascading', 'cheerleader', 'blouse', 'Not', 'only', 'cheap', 'trick', 'waste', 'time', 'dishonest', 'why', 'ca', ""n't"", 'see', 'what', 'Spacey', 'character', 'REALLY', 'thinking', 'about', 'opinion', 'roses', 'thing', 'cop-out', 'film', 'courage', 'convictions', 'who', 'NC-17', 'rating', 'No', 'theaters', 'screen', 'NC-17', 'films', 'NC-17', 'films', 'never', 'win', 'Oscars.Kevin', 'Spacey', 'using', 'Kevin-Spacey-Shtik', 'droll', 'expressions', 'world-weary', 'murmur', 'al', 'character', 'most', 'care', ""'m"", 'intimating', 'thanks', 'Considering', 'ponderous', 'denouement', 'facile', 'interpretation', ""n't"", 'really', 'called', 'need', 'more', 'serious', 'performance', 'other', 'characters', 'are', 'cartoons', 'Termagant', 'Wife', 'Spooky', 'Teenager', 'are', 'several', 'Repressed', 'Homosexual.To', 'finish', 'slick', 'attempt', 'quot', 'sophistication', 'quot', 'e.g.', 'Floating', 'Trash', 'Bag', 'Rose', 'Petals', 'Voice', 'Grave', 'very', 'mainstream', 'tale', 'told', 'surprisingly', 'average', 'way', 'actors', 'chew', 'scenery', 'Bening', 'blubbering', 'Spacey', 'snapping', 'wrists', 'bag', 'burgers', 'been', 'done', 'just', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'what', 'fuss', 'quot', 'American', 'Beauty', 'quot', 'merits', 'ai', ""n't"", 'quot', 'Lolita', 'quot']",Belleza Americana American Beauty  VHS

Just watch the evening news or read the newspaper...or look around most neighborhoods.

A miserable middle-aged man discontent with his job and his marriage - seeking affection from young girls to recapture his lost youth.

This definitely was the best movie put out that year. A modern classic in the making. In this era of Hollywood blockbusters, where special effects and noise seem to take precedence over well written sripts and acting, it is a true pleasure to find such an articulate, meaningful and well made film. This is the story of an upper middle class family, who's lives are turned upside down, when outsiders seperately come into their world. A father, mother and a teenage daughter all experience emotional awakenings and transformations, that later will have strong repercussions on thier lives.In the end this is a film about finding beauty and happiness in this world. Alan Ball (of HBO's &quot;Six Feet Under&quot;) has written a brilliant script which seems to make you want to laugh and cry at the same time.Director Sam Mendes has pulled off an audacious debut which skillfully brings this story to life.The acting in this film is first rate.

67716,AQ4NJ2T9PVI3L,0783239408,"Kitten With a Whip ""kittenwithawhip""","[4, 6]","Could be the best movie of 1999- And there were a lot of great ones last year. I will also say something even (possibly) bolder--that Kevin Spacey gives the performance of his career. And all us movie geeks know that is  saying a LOT, given this  man's past roles, and his talent. I used to think  he was overrated as an actor. Then I figured OK, I see what all the fuss is  about. Now, he's up there with my favorite actors of all time, with James  Woods, Steve Buscemi, Robert Deniro...probably in the top 5. I was lucky  enough to see a free screening last September and boy, am I glad I had the  privilege...it's one of those movies that blows you away so much that you  have trouble even putting your feelings into words.  I rented it over the  weekend and loved it just as much upon second (and 3rd, and 4th, and 5th)  watchings. The plotline sounds trite when you first describe it (it did to  me when I first heard about it), Spacey plays a man who describes himself  as a loser, with Bening as his horrible, shrewish, self-absorbed, pathetic  b*tch of a wife. His daughter is not all that likeable either, despite the  fact that you can understand why she  turned out this way, with her as a  mother. Just when you think you've met the most dysfunctional family in  the world outside of &quot;Happiness&quot;, you find out about the family  who just moved in next door. At first, the  strange son seems like the most  messed-up member of their brood, but after you get to meet his ex-military,  abusive, homophobic, terrifying father and his withdrawn, sad, headcase  mother, you realize he  is the most normal member of the household by far.  Then, the filmwriters toss in Kevin Spacey's lustful obsession with his  daughter's sexkitten cheerleader friend, which trust me, is a lot more fun,  entertaining,  and amusing than it sounds when you read about it. Soon, he  is having the most entertaining, hilarious midlife crisis ever seen in the  history of cinema. He just doesn't give a ***k about what he does or says  anymore, and you only wish you could get away with doing the things he  does. I found myself laughing out loud in this movie so many times, most of  it horrified, amazed laughter at what was happening and the things that are  coming out of the character's mouths, especially Spacey's. He had at least  a dozen lines that had every member of the audience in hysterics and actual  applause and cheers.  I can't say enough good things about this movie. You  think, after the first five minutes, that you know how the movie will end.  Well, Spacey's opening narrative does give it away, but trust me, the  events unfold in a  way that you will NEVER see coming. You will swear you  can see what a character is going to do next, what  violent or  self-destructice act they will commit, but you turn out to be wrong.  Without getting too pretentious here, the movie lives up to it's  theme/tagline of &quot;...look closer&quot;. The characters are not what  they seem, up until the end, and even then they surprise you. At least two  characters  that you are POSITIVE you have figured out, do or say something  that turns all your preconceptions of them  upside down, while making your  jaw drop, and your heart ache. All the acting is stunning, but I honestly  can't imagine it being the same movie (or enjoying it as much) with anyone  but Spacey in the lead role. You will leave the movie with a smile, though,  and that is maybe what I expected least of all.

67717,A63T5DNBZ3O3S,0783239408,klingsithvamp,"[0, 1]","With so many reviews, I guess the core materials have been covered.  So, into the fray!  American Beauty was much hailed, but Ref, essentially an earlier concept of the same movie, went unrecognized, due to its comedic classification.  The Ref utilized some of the same cast members, whose performance there, I felt, was superior.  Despite the show's sometimes goofy presentation, the issues and emotions had far more depth than the later release.  Too, Beauty had a preachy quality, telling you how to live your life.  The Ref, doesn't really tell you how; it just says you can't control everything that happens to you - deal with it.  Furthermore, Beauty had a flitty feel (perhaps a result of the repetitious musical cues), simply inhanced by one-dimensional characters, who never really connect.  The Ref's characters are very similar, on a basic level; and yet, they not only connect, they clash painfully.  Even the insignificant townsfolk have layers of unexplored realism.  These people are forced to confront their issues, to learn and grow.  Beauty's people, on the other hand, seem to drift even further into their own isolated misery, spiting the movies intended message.  Leary's role in The Ref is multi fold.  Primarily, he is the catalyst of change and the voice of chaos - little effort on his part.  Ultimately, while his humor may have removed the film from any Oscar contentions, it also gives the viewer a much needed stress release valve.  The drama there is so intense, you get the idea that this family would happily choke the life out of each other.  When (like me) Leary goes off on a rant, anger is displaced with negative jocularity, creating an antithetical surrealism.  It's like being comforted by the fact that your buddies laugh at you for doing something stupid. The &quot;ref&quot; both makes and breaks the movie.  I will concede this however; had I not seen The Ref, my opinion of American Beauty would be higher.  You know how it is; everything is relative - good is only good until there is something better (but in this case, better came first).",3,Beauty - vs. - Ref,1075766400,"02 3, 2004",2004,2085,"['so', 'many', 'reviews', 'guess', 'core', 'materials', 'have', 'been', 'covered', 'So', 'fray', 'American', 'Beauty', 'was', 'much', 'hailed', 'Ref', 'essentially', 'earlier', 'concept', 'same', 'movie', 'went', 'unrecognized', 'due', 'comedic', 'classification', 'Ref', 'utilized', 'same', 'cast', 'members', 'performance', 'there', 'felt', 'was', 'superior', 'show', 'sometimes', 'goofy', 'presentation', 'issues', 'emotions', 'had', 'far', 'more', 'depth', 'later', 'release', 'Too', 'Beauty', 'had', 'preachy', 'quality', 'telling', 'how', 'live', 'life', 'Ref', ""n't"", 'really', 'tell', 'how', 'just', 'ca', ""n't"", 'control', 'everything', 'deal', 'Furthermore', 'Beauty', 'had', 'flitty', 'feel', 'perhaps', 'result', 'repetitious', 'musical', 'cues', 'simply', 'inhanced', 'one-dimensional', 'characters', 'who', 'never', 'really', 'connect', 'Ref', 'characters', 'are', 'very', 'similar', 'basic', 'level', 'yet', 'not', 'only', 'connect', 'clash', 'painfully', 'Even', 'insignificant', 'townsfolk', 'have', 'layers', 'unexplored', 'realism', 'people', 'are', 'forced', 'confront', 'issues', 'learn', 'grow', 'Beauty', 'people', 'other', 'hand', 'seem', 'drift', 'even', 'further', 'own', 'isolated', 'misery', 'spiting', 'movies', 'intended', 'message', 'Leary', 'role', 'Ref', 'multi', 'fold', 'Primarily', 'catalyst', 'change', 'voice', 'chaos', 'little', 'effort', 'part', 'Ultimately', 'humor', 'may', 'have', 'removed', 'film', 'Oscar', 'contentions', 'also', 'viewer', 'much', 'needed', 'stress', 'release', 'valve', 'drama', 'so', 'intense', 'get', 'idea', 'family', 'would', 'happily', 'choke', 'life', 'other', 'When', 'Leary', 'off', 'rant', 'anger', 'displaced', 'negative', 'jocularity', 'creating', 'antithetical', 'surrealism', 'being', 'comforted', 'fact', 'buddies', 'laugh', 'doing', 'something', 'stupid', 'quot', 'quot', 'breaks', 'movie', 'will', 'concede', 'however', 'had', 'not', 'seen', 'Ref', 'opinion', 'American', 'Beauty', 'would', 'be', 'higher', 'know', 'how', 'everything', 'relative', 'good', 'only', 'good', 'something', 'better', 'case', 'better', 'came', 'first']",Belleza Americana American Beauty  VHS

There were countless better movies released last year (Fight Club, Dogma, Being John Malkovich,  Magnolia, to name a few).  Was it a good movie?  Yes, absolutely.  Was it  the best movie ever and deserving of the Oscar?  No way.  It's the same  dried up story line--yes, the actors were brilliant, the screenplay was  great, and the movie was very funny in parts, but it wasn't anything that  we've never seen before.  Kevin Spacey's obsession with his daughter's  friend was much more disturbing to me than than the violence in Fight Club.  When I went to see this movie, I fully expected to love it, but instead I  just thought it was sort of okay.  I felt like they were trying to cram  every single issue on the face of the earth into two and a half  hours--adultery, unhappy marriage, drug use, teenage sex, job unhappiness,  etc.  It felt like too much to me, and ended up feeling forced.

67719,A3K1LK6DJCVPUK,0783239408,K. Palmer,"[0, 0]","I bought the awards edition of American Beauty, which contains one tape with the movie itself and a second tape that shows a 20 minute &quot;Making of A.B&quot; show with interviews with the director, producer and cast and then a one hour show where director Sam Mendes goes through storyboards about the making of the film, also bringing in his cinematographer for commentary.I really can't add much to the reviews of the many people who liked this movie.  This movie is great because people can relate to Lester and Carolyn and their feelings.  I definitely can see myself writing a similar &quot;how I contribute&quot; letter to my company that Lester did.  My wife could definitely see herself as getting obsessed over material things and how things look like Carolyn does.  So it really is an eye opener in that respect.  There were some things that I just didn't get (the video of the bag in the wind, Ricky's catatonic mother), but the performances of Kevin Spacey and Annette Benning more than overshadow these flaws.I will say that if you can get through the bonus second tape, you'll probably only do it once.

It takes a sort of satiric look at how our lives really are. We all can identify with most of the characters. We laugh and cry, we think and sympathize, we remember and never forget. In the cases of Lester and Carolyn Burnham (Kevin Spacey and Annette Bening), Robin Hood Trail's &quot;unordinary&quot; ordinary couple, we see their once happy union crumble before our eyes. Their daughter, Jane (Thora Birch), a sad, alienated girl with no happiness in her life. She takes comfort in her oversexed, but obviously ordinary friend Angela Hayes (Mena Suvari) and her voyeuristic, drug dealing boyfriend Ricky Fitts (Wes Bentley, a very boring actor!). In the house next door is the Fitts family; Marine Colonel Frank Fitts (Chris Cooper) and Barbara Fitts (Alison Janney), along with son Ricky. When everyone's secrets, which is the climax of the film, is revealed, they are all affected by it. Which leads to Lester being shot dead by Colonel Fitts, who is really a latent homosexual; Carolyn's only chance at happiness with her lover, fellow real estater Buddy Kane (Peter Gallagher) is destroyed when Lester discovers them fooling around, literally; Jane and Angela are no longer friends; Jane decides to run away with Ricky, who is thrown out of his house by his abusive father. This film obviously affected many critics and people as well; enough to garner five Oscars for Picture, Director, Actor, Screenplay, and Cinematography. This is definitely a film that is among the great tragicomedies such as &quot;The Apartment,&quot; &quot;Annie Hall,&quot; and &quot;Terms of Endearment.&quot; To make us laugh and cry is an amazing accomplishment which, lucky for these four films, they have done with precision and taste.",5,A Beauty-ful film,972172800,"10 22, 2000",2000,2031,"['collection', '43', 'Oscar-winning', 'Best', 'Picture', 'films', 'quot', 'Eve', 'quot', 'quot', 'West', 'Side', 'Story', 'quot', 'have', 'say', 'quot', 'American', 'Beauty', 'quot', 'been', 'collection', 'two', 'months', 'out', 'VHS', 'DVD', 'excellent', 'ode', 'fathers', 'who', 'are', 'very', 'unhappy', 'sort', 'satiric', 'look', 'how', 'lives', 'really', 'are', 'can', 'identify', 'most', 'characters', 'laugh', 'cry', 'think', 'sympathize', 'remember', 'never', 'forget', 'cases', 'Lester', 'Carolyn', 'Burnham', 'Kevin', 'Spacey', 'Annette', 'Bening', 'Robin', 'Hood', 'Trail', 'quot', 'unordinary', 'quot', 'ordinary', 'couple', 'see', 'once', 'happy', 'union', 'crumble', 'eyes', 'daughter', 'Jane', 'Thora', 'Birch', 'sad', 'alienated', 'girl', 'happiness', 'life', 'comfort', 'oversexed', 'obviously', 'ordinary', 'friend', 'Angela', 'Hayes', 'Mena', 'Suvari', 'voyeuristic', 'drug', 'dealing', 'boyfriend', 'Ricky', 'Fitts', 'Wes', 'Bentley', 'very', 'boring', 'actor', 'house', 'next', 'door', 'Fitts', 'family', 'Marine', 'Colonel', 'Frank', 'Fitts', 'Chris', 'Cooper', 'Barbara', 'Fitts', 'Alison', 'Janney', 'son', 'Ricky', 'When', 'everyone', 'secrets', 'climax', 'film', 'revealed', 'are', 'affected', 'Which', 'Lester', 'being', 'shot', 'dead', 'Colonel', 'Fitts', 'who', 'really', 'latent', 'homosexual', 'Carolyn', 'only', 'chance', 'happiness', 'lover', 'fellow', 'real', 'estater', 'Buddy', 'Kane', 'Peter', 'Gallagher', 'destroyed', 'when', 'Lester', 'fooling', 'around', 'literally', 'Jane', 'Angela', 'are', 'no', 'longer', 'Jane', 'run', 'away', 'Ricky', 'who', 'thrown', 'house', 'abusive', 'father', 'film', 'obviously', 'affected', 'many', 'critics', 'people', 'as', 'well', 'enough', 'garner', 'five', 'Oscars', 'Picture', 'Director', 'Actor', 'Screenplay', 'Cinematography', 'definitely', 'film', 'great', 'tragicomedies', 'such', 'quot', 'Apartment', 'quot', 'quot', 'Annie', 'Hall', 'quot', 'quot', 'Terms', 'Endearment.', 'quot', 'make', 'laugh', 'cry', 'amazing', 'accomplishment', 'four', 'films', 'have', 'done', 'precision', 'taste']",Belleza Americana American Beauty  VHS

Holder ""The Review's the Thing""","[3, 6]","'American Beauty' is an artistic film that uses a great deal of cinematic skill to underscore the ironies in one man's life, with the ultimate irony being that regardless of temptation, each person will be true to their ideals when faced with ultimate threats to those ideals.Kevin Spacey plays Lester Burnham, who is fired very early in the film. Annette Bening plays his wife Carolyn. Very quickly, the stereotypes begin. One sub-theme throughout the movie is Kevin's desire for a pretty high school cheerleader. However, the real sub-theme is wanting what you can't really ever have. This same theme is repeated for each of the major characters, from Carolyn to their next-door neighbor Colonel Frank Fitts to Ricky Fitts, Frank's son, played by Wes Bentley, to Jane Burnham, Lester and Carolyn's daughter, played by Thora Birch. Each wants something they do not have. To varying degrees, each gets what they think they want, but, and this is the real moral of the movie and the story, what you think you want isn't truly what you wanted, because when you get what you want, it doesn't give you the happiness you thought you were going to get.Kevin spends much of the movie working out, buying his dream muscle car, and lusting after Angela Hayes, played by Mena Suvari. It certainly seems as though his purchases are providing him happiness. However, he is looking for the relationship he once had with his wife. In a pivotal scene in the movie, Lester and Carolyn are in the immaculate living room of their house. Lester has a beer, and begins to get somewhat amorous. Just as it looks as though something might spark, Kevin spills his beer, which causes Carolyn to be more concerned about the expensive couch than their relationship. Is this shallowness a cliche? Yes it is. However, there is more to the story than just cliches.As the story unfolds and each character seems to be making progress toward getting what they want, in many cases the scenes are set up as fantasies, which are beautifully and artfully done. I find one of the most intriguing characters to be Ricky Fitts. Ricky wants his father's unconditional love, and loves his father, but somehow you sense that he knows he'll never get it. Further, I felt that Ricky knew that eventually something bad would happen between his father and him. The sense of impending disaster that Ricky anticipates through his actions and his attitude infects the rest of the movie with the same feeling. Almost as though you were in quicksand and knew a bad end was coming, but it comes so slowly that you don't realize it until it is too late.The real beauty in the movie is at the end. While I will not reveal all the details, I will reveal important details, so if you do not want to know, I'll tell you quickly that this movie is very artsy and well-acted. If those types of movies appeal to you, you will love this one.Near the end of the movie, Lester finally has an opportunity to be with Angela. It is the very last thing Lester has wanted throughout the entire movie, that he has, up to now, been unable to get, and here he has his chance. However, there is a small problem. After Angela's top has been removed, she asks Lester to be gentle because it's her first time.What? Hasn't Angela been telling Jane Burnham throughout the movie about her sexual exploits? Yes. Here's part of the sub-theme once again. Angela in fact has wanted to have the experiences to match her bragging. Now that she has the real opportunity to have it happen, she is fearful. Lester realizes that he cannot take away Angela's innocence, and tells her to get dressed. Both realize continuing would be a mistake for both. An incredible, but very correct decision for each. The movie brilliantly puts a most incredible temptation to two people, and they both realize that getting what they thought they wanted would make neither happy.I'm not going to reveal what happens next. I admit I was surprised that Lester would resist temptation, but proud of him too. He was tested, if by no one else then by himself, and he passed. He proved that he was stronger than nearly all the other characters in the movie. Of course, this scene sets up the final irony.A brief word on symbolism. The rose is used as a part of Lester's fantasies throughout the entire movie. Remember that the rose is a symbol of many things, love and purity being only one of them.The visual beauty of this movie is used to drive home the theme. The movie is not only ironic in the way the characters and the scenes are played out; the movie is visually ironic as well. To explain that irony would require giving the ending away more than I have. One other thing: This movie does not condone 40+ men having sex with under 18 girls any more than 'Pretty Woman' romanticizes and fosters prostitution. If you believe that this movie is all about one man's fantasy with a young girl, you missed the point. Try once more and hang in there, the meaning is deeper, and subtler. However, you have to watch to the very last scene and think about the symbolism of everything you saw. This movie is truly beautiful, very well done, and an instant, very artistic classic. I would rate this movie more than 5 stars if I could.",5,"Visually Artistic, Well Acted",1036713600,"11 8, 2002",2002,5222,"[""'American"", 'Beauty', 'artistic', 'film', 'great', 'deal', 'cinematic',

It's not meant to be thrilling, spine-tingling, or nail-biting action.  It's meant to take a picture of America that all of us know so well exists, and yet we deny it so vehemently to our friends.  &quot;Our marriage is fine.&quot;  &quot;We have a good, well-behaved boy.&quot;Who knows?  &quot;Look closer&quot; is a sign you find in Kevin Spacey's cubicle and I will not try to be blase in saying that it IS the overall theme in the movie, but it comes pretty close to the mark.Is everything you expect it to be?  Are American neighborhoods truly the sanctum of the &quot;decent living&quot; that we all say that it is?  No.  The opening scene with Anette Benning in the front lawn is just a simple, yet powerfully shot scene of the &quot;mask&quot; that we put on ourselves to suppress the futility we feel in our own lives.  &quot;Look closer&quot; at a mid-life crisis, a frustrated wife, a confused and underappreciated teenage girl, another teenage girl displacing sexual insecurity by being overtly sexual, and the drug-selling boy next door who so much wants to find beauty in his own life that he seeks it elsewhere--we don't often realize that everyone goes through a silent misery of pain everyday.  Stop saying &quot;I'm fine&quot; to everyone when you're not...a great deal can be accomplished if we were all a little more honest with each other.Can you not say that you can't relate to someone or yourself in this film?  I'll be 100% amazed if you can.  I, for one, can relate to the side of the &quot;disturbed-boy-next-door&quot; who sees unusual beauty in mundane, every-day situations.I would like to definitely put my 10 cents in on the final scene.  What does the boy find beautiful about Kevin Spacey in the end?  Because Kevin Spacey has finally found a frozen moment in time when everything WAS wonderful in his life--only to be frozen in eternity.Please don't listen to those who say &quot;I don't get it.&quot;  Those who don't get it probably deserve a casting role in this film, ironically.",5,&quot;Beautiful!&quot;,990144000,"05 18, 2001",2001,2186,"['am', 'little', 'more', 'amazed', 'BAD', 'reviews', 'film', 'ranging', 'quot', 'story', 'quot', 'quot', 'what.', 'quot', 'Do', 'understand', 'what', 'have', 'here', 'not', 'meant', 'be', 'thrilling', 'spine-tingling', 'nail-biting', 'action', 'meant', 'take', 'picture', 'America', 'know', 'so', 'well', 'yet', 'deny', 'so', 'vehemently', 'friends', 'quot', 'marriage', 'fine.', 'quot', 'quot', 'have', 'good', 'well-behaved', 'boy.', 'quot', 'Who', 'quot', 'Look', 'closer', 'quot', 'sign', 'find', 'Kevin', 'Spacey', 'cubicle', 'will', 'not', 'try', 'be', 'blase', 'saying', 'overall', 'theme', 'movie', 'pretty', 'close', 'mark.Is', 'everything', 'expect', 'be', 'Are', 'American', 'neighborhoods', 'truly', 'sanctum', 'quot', 'decent', 'living', 'quot', 'say', 'No', 'opening', 'scene', 'Anette', 'Benning', 'front', 'lawn', 'just', 'simple', 'yet', 'powerfully', 'shot', 'scene', 'quot', 'quot', 'put', 'ourselves', 'suppress', 'futility', 'feel', 'own', 'lives', 'quot', 'Look', 'closer', 'quot', 'mid-life', 'crisis', 'frustrated', 'wife', 'confused', 'underappreciated', 'teenage', 'girl', 'teenage', 'girl', 'displacing', 'sexual', 'insecurity', 'being', 'overtly', 'sexual', 'drug-selling', 'boy', 'next', 'door', 'who', 'so', 'much', 'find', 'beauty', 'own', 'life', 'elsewhere', 'do', ""n't"", 'often', 'realize', 'everyone', 'silent', 'misery', 'pain', 'everyday', 'Stop', 'saying', 'quot', ""'m"", 'fine', 'quot', 'everyone', 'when', ""'re"", 'not', 'great', 'deal', 'can', 'be', 'accomplished', 'were', 'little', 'more', 'honest', 'other.Can', 'not', 'say', 'ca', ""n't"", 'relate', 'someone', 'film', ""'ll"", 'be', '100', '%', 'amazed', 'can', 'one', 'can', 'relate', 'side', 'quot', 'disturbed-boy-next-door', 'quot', 'who', 'unusual', 'beauty', 'mundane', 'every-day', 'situations.I', 'would', 'like', 'definitely', 'put', '10', 'cents', 'final', 'scene', 'What', 'boy', 'find', 'beautiful', 'Kevin', 'Spacey', 'end', 'Kevin', 'Spacey', 'finally', 'found', 'frozen', 'moment', 'time', 'when', 'everything', 'WAS', 'wonderful', 'life', 'only', 'be', 'frozen', 'eternity.Please', 'do', ""n't"", 'listen', 'who', 'say', 'quot', 'do', ""n't"", 'get', 'it.', 'quot', 'who', 'do', ""n't"", 'get', 'probably', 'deserve', 'casting', 'role', 'film', 'ironically']",Belleza Americana American Beauty  VHS

67748,A2QGP7E8LSC7TG,0783239408,Mark Baum,"[5, 6]","Now I can forgive the packaging of the film that features the dancing plastic grocery bag (blown by a couple offscreen crew with leaf blowers). Or the cheesy ""look closer"" slogan. The DVD packaging and extras doesn't dilute the overall strength of the film: A masterpiece by Sam Mendes and cinematographer Conrad L. Hall with the sharp writing of Alan Ball with a tour de force acting ensemble.To this day, when I'm exposed to it, the local Pittsburgh ""soft rock"" station's brainless and vapid morning show hosts can't help but state their disdain for this film. Quite possibly because the film does strike a nerve by those who try in vain to seek ""normalcy"" but fail. It's as if the harder they try the worst traits immediately come to the surface.Have you ever listened to such people? I mean, actually think about what they're saying? Behind the cheery suburbanite gloss lies rot. Most of the time such people just repeat clich&eacute;s or parrot words without giving thought as to what they mean. It's as if it's the modern age's version of neanderthal grunting.Nearly 12-years later and ""American Beauty"" still strikes a jarring chord against such vapidly stupid people. And, thinking back, 1999 was a decent year for films such as ""Fight Club"", ""Magnolia"", ""The Matrix"" and ""Bringing Out The Dead"". The great films of that year (barring ""The Iron Giant"" which was a joyous film in and of itself) were decidedly downbeat with the close of 19xx into the opening of 20xx.Think of a David Lynch film and how it plays with the idea of the rot within suburbia. Now move that into the lament of the yuppie class attempting to deal with how keeping busy with appearances eventually becomes. It begins slick but despite the very high production values the rot is right there. It's the end of a dream as the reality hits home: A tale of wasted time with a downbeat ending.The only respite from the darkness would be the black humor and, as it all disintegrates in the end, a cover of ""Because"" plays over the end credits.It's not a movie I watch all the time. But there are moments when it's worth viewing. such as right now. And while it is a very glossy production can lead to the film seeming a bit pretentious it's still a movie I consider a classic after all these years.Maybe ""look closer"" isn't just a trite clich&eacute; after all. The movie is great for those who possess a certain misanthropic, cynical yet realistic streak, such as myself. And goodness knows how many people I've seen die or come close to death. Or even people just shuffling around already dead in regards to their own human spirit. This movie doesn't give answers but it does lead to interesting questions as you do ""look closer"" at what's around you in real life.",5,"It's a movie that ""normal"" people hate.",1301097600,"03 26, 2011",2011,2740,"['Now', 'can', 'forgive', 'packaging', 'film', 'dancing', 'plastic', 'grocery', 'bag', 'blown', 'couple', 'offscreen', 'crew', 'leaf', 'blowers', 'cheesy', 'look', 'closer', 'slogan', 'DVD', 'packaging', 'extras', ""n't"", 'dilute', 'overall', 'strength', 'film', 'masterpiece', 'Sam', 'Mendes', 'cinematographer', 'Conrad', 'L.', 'Hall', 'sharp', 'writing', 'Alan', 'Ball', 'tour', 'de', 'force', 'acting', 'ensemble.To', 'day', 'when', ""'m"", 'exposed', 'local', 'Pittsburgh', 'soft', 'rock', 'station', 'brainless', 'vapid', 'morning', 'show', 'hosts', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'state', 'disdain', 'film', 'Quite', 'possibly', 'film', 'strike', 'nerve', 'who', 'try', 'vain', 'seek', 'normalcy', 'fail', 'harder', 'try', 'worst', 'traits', 'immediately', 'come', 'surface.Have', 'ever', 'listened', 'such', 'people', 'mean', 'actually', 'think', 'what', ""'re"", 'saying', 'cheery', 'suburbanite', 'gloss', 'rot', 'Most', 'time', 'such', 'people', 'just', 'repeat', 'clich', 'eacute', 'parrot', 'words', 'giving', 'thought', 'what', 'mean', 'modern', 'age', 'version', 'neanderthal', 'grunting.Nearly', '12-years', 'later', 'American', 'Beauty', 'still', 'jarring', 'chord', 'such', 'vapidly', 'stupid', 'people', 'thinking', 'back', '1999', 'was', 'decent', 'year', 'films', 'such', 'Fight', 'Club', 'Magnolia', 'Matrix', 'Bringing', 'Out', 'Dead', 'great', 'films', 'year', 'barring', 'Iron', 'Giant', 'was', 'joyous', 'film', 'were', 'decidedly', 'downbeat', 'close', '19xx', 'opening', '20xx.Think', 'David', 'Lynch', 'film', 'how', 'idea', 'rot', 'suburbia', 'Now', 'move', 'lament', 'yuppie', 'class', 'attempting', 'deal', 'how', 'keeping', 'busy', 'appearances', 'eventually', 'slick', 'very', 'high', 'production', 'rot', 'right', 'there', 'end', 'dream', 'reality', 'home', 'tale', 'wasted', 'time', 'downbeat', 'only', 'respite', 'darkness', 'would', 'be', 'black', 'humor', 'end', 'cover', 'plays', 'end', 'credits.It', 'not', 'movie', 'watch', 'time', 'are', 'moments', 'when', 'worth', 'viewing', 'such', 'right', 'now', 'very', 'glossy', 'production', 'can', 'lead', 'film', 'seeming', 'bit', 'pretentious', 'still', 'movie', 'consider', 'classic', 'years.Maybe', 'look', 'closer', ""n't"", 'just', 'trite', 'clich', 'eacute', 'movie', 'great', 'who', 'possess', 'certain', 'misanthropic', 'cynical', 'yet', 'realistic', 'streak', 'such', 'goodness', 'how', 'many', 'people', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'die', 'come', 'close', 'death', 'even', 'people', 'just', 'shuffling', 'around', 'already', 'dead', 'regards', 'own', 'human', 'spirit', 'movie', ""n't"", 'give', 'answers', 'lead', 'interesting', 'questions', 'do', 'look', 'closer', 'what', 'around', 'real', 'life']",Belleza Americana American Beauty  VHS

67753,A319KYEIAZ3SON,0783239408,Mary Whipple,"[4, 7]","Winner of Academy Awards in 2000 for Best Picture, Best Actor (Kevin Spacey), Best Cinematography (Conrad L. Hall) , Best Screenplay (Alan Ball), and Best Director (Sam Mendes), this genre-defying film appears, on the surface, to be a typical domestic drama, filled with black humor and containing a coming-of-age subplot--and then it becomes surreal.  Lester Burnham (Spacey), like all the other characters in the film, is unhappy and alienated.  He hates his job, dislikes his bosses, and resents his hostile and driven wife, but when he finally frees himself from his desk job and takes a job at a fast food establishment, everything in his life goes crazy.Lester is not-so-secretly attracted to the bored, teenage friend (the flirty Mena Suvari) of his daughter (beautifully played by Thora Birch).  His wife (Annette Bening) has shut herself off from him, and initiates a tawdry affair.  His alienated daughter is attracted to the equally alienated, drug-selling teenager (Wes Bentley) next door, a boy who has just been released from a two-year hospitalization and who stands outside her house shooting videos.  The boy's father (Chris Cooper), an ex-Marine, rules the family with an ungloved fist.The Burnhams and the Fittses, next door, appear at first to be fairly typical suburban families, living typical suburban lives, but as these alienated people try, first, to cope with their alienation and then figure out a way to resolve it, the film becomes darkly surreal.  Each character chooses to cope in an extreme way, a way that would not make sense for  the ""typical"" families which they appear to represent, and eventually the characters, acting on their extreme choices, collide in a dramatic, horrifying conclusion.Director Mendes somehow manages to make this genre-bending film work, creating a likable character in Lester (Spacey), a termagant wife (Bening) who manages to elicit a modicum of sympathy, and teenagers who exhibit the typical angst of their age while, at the same time, evoking our own tender memories.  Even the domineering Col. Fitts becomes human as we see him trying to cope with his own threatening demons.  The drama builds slowly, the tension rises inexorably, and the final scenes are intense.  Astonishingly, even the final scene has elements of black humor.  With all its Academy Awards, and its additional Academy nominations for Best Actress, Best Music, and Best Editing, this is a top-notch film which will interest film buffs and lovers of dark comedy, and its ""heart"" makes it unforgettable.

67754,A3PA0W1VUDU4J7,0783239408,Mat,"[2, 5]","(...)The first time I saw American Beauty it was the last in three consecutive weekend movie run. The other two films were Fight Club and Bringing Out the Dead. All three films are about men trying to come to terms to what it means to be a man in America in this day and age. Fight Club finds meaning in deconstructing everything down to base needs, feeling through pain. Bringing Out the Dead gives meaning to its character through drug use, but is was in American Beauty that I found some sense of hope.In the film, Lester Burnham (Kevin Spacey) plays a middle aged, middle class suburbanite, with seemingly everything he could desire. He has a good, well paying job; a beautiful wife (Annette Bening); a large luxurious house; and a lovely daughter (Thora Birch). Yet, with all of this he is not happy. In fact, all of these things are not quite what they seem. His employer is facing cut backs, and he may soon lose his job. He marriage is in shambles, and his daughter openly hates him. Early, we see him masturbating in the shower, in narration; he states this is the highpoint of his day. All is not well in the house of Burnham.All of this changes when Lester meets Angela (Mena Suvari), his daughter, Jane's gorgeous, cheerleader friend. On first seeing Angela during a cheer routine, Lester feel a special, lustful connection. Later that night, Lester overhears Angela playfully tell Jane that if he would only work out, he would be sexy. His lust over this teenage vixen becomes the catalyst for the film and Lester's very life.Soon after Lester quits his job, in fact he bilks the company for a year's salary by threatening to disclose scandalous information that he has become privy to. He begins smoking pot, buys a hot rod.. He plays with remote control cars, takes a job at a fast food joint, and of course does start working out. In every way he reverts back to his teenage years. Even the soundtrack begins blaring out classic rock tunes from the 1970's. Finally after years, decades even, of feeling low, miserable, not alive, he feels great.This reversion back to his glory days is only the beginning. It is a reversion back to the days when he had fun, when he felt alive. But he is not a man who will stop there. This is just a beginning point to a life long conversion of living a full life, as opposed to a life full of the right things, but that is ultimately empty. Or it would be if he was not shortly dead (this is not nearly the spoiler you might think it is, for Lester announced his death within the first minutes of the film.) Towards the end of the film we can see that Lester is already outgrowing his childish behavior. When he yells at his daughter, he immediately feels the sting of regret. When given the chance to indulge in his lusts, he backs away, understanding that it is not right. Just as the music changed to classic rock with the first change, here it has changed again, turning into the same classic rock being covered by newer, contemporary artists.Many will probably say that using the lust for a teen, and illicit drug us as a catalyst for change, is not a change for the better. I can already hear my mother scolding me for having seen the movie, much less reviewed it from 2,000 miles away in Oklahoma. Yet, here it works, and works well. I don't believe the film is saying that these things should be the means to a change, these things only served as means for this character to break free from the rut that had become his life. There is a telling scene where Lester and his wife are overcome with sexual desire. As he dips his wife to kiss her, she stops the embrace because he is near to spilling his glass of wine on an expensive couch. An argument ensues with Lester proclaiming that ""it's just a couch,"" while his wife is horrified at the thought of ruining said couch. There lies one of the central themes of the film. That these characters are so wrapped up in the material that they lose sight of the better pleasure of life, including love making.It is not a perfect film. The Burnham's neighbor, Col. Fritts (Chris Cooper) seems a caricatured archetype. His plays a hateful, homophobe who really carries deep rooted homosexual tendencies is too outlandish to be considered real. Though it must be said the part is played marvelously by Chris Cooper. Jane's speech about being a freak too, may move the young kids who consider themselves the nonconformist, shy-type, but it is too after-school special for my tastes.I've left out some of the best scenes and an important character, Ricky Fitts (Wes Bentley). He plays the drug dealing son of Col. Fritts, who likes to record everything on his video camera. There is a moving scene in which he and Jane watch an old tape of his of a plastic bag floating through the air. It is a moving, poetic scene that conjures up thought of the futility of life and its very beauty. It is that type of movie. It creates beautiful, moving, simple scenes that bring a sense of hope to life, while at the same time, showing the ultimate horror of living it.(...)",3,"Pretty Silly, But Fun",1115078400,"05 3,

I was going down the escalator of a posh local multiplex, and there it was at the end of my descent. I looked at those red roses adorning an actresses midsection, and I remarked to a friend that this looked like a very special movie. I don't what it was about the artwork that made me say that, but it turned out to be an accurate remark. The movie opened in a limited engagement in September 1999 and went on to build and build. In March, it won Oscars in major categories - Best Picture, Best Actor [Kevin Spacey] and Best Director. At the time, there were some nay-sayers who said the film painted too dark a picture of American life. I won't debate this, but I will say that there are precedents in the Academy Awards. For example, Billy Wilder's The Apartment, a scathing comedy about how morally low some people will go to move up in corporate life, won Best Picture in 1961. Brilliant is brilliant, no matter what the subject is, and America has had a seriously cynical side to it for decades.Welcome to the Burnham household. Meet Lester and Carolyn [Spacey and Annette Bening] and their lovely teenage daughter, Jane [Thora Birch]. The Burnhams have it all - the lucrative jobs, the topflight public schools, the perfect suburban home, the immaculate lawn with its borders of American beauty roses. What could possibly be missing from their lives? Oh, just little things like happiness and fulfillment. Lester and Carolyn certainly no longer love each other. Theirs is an uneasy truce. On the surface, Jane comes across as a snide and ungrateful child, but you have to ask yourself who wouldn't be eager to leave such a dismal scene? How often many of us point the finger at our children when what we are showing them are lives devoid of love, passion, honestly and integrity.Jane is a cheerleader at the local high school, and one night the Burnhams decide to attend a game. They want to show support for their daughter, who truly doesn't want them there. Lester sees another cheerleader, a friend of Jane's, and instantly falls in lust. He becomes obsessed with the girl. He quits his job and blackmails his boss into giving him $60,000 severance pay. He buys a red Pontiac Firebird. Carolyn, who constantly berates herself for not being a success, retaliates by starting an affair with an arch rival in the real estate business. Their actions are not exactly what they appear to be. Lester's pursuit isn't all about an older man / young girl relationships. Its about the loss of youth and passion and about the dire consequences that can be spawned by living a whole lifetime of fitting in. Carolyn feels she has totally lost controlnot just of Lester and Jane, but of life as a whole. I think they are after the same answers, only Lester uses a brutally honest approach. And now Jane is really ready to split.Compounding all these problems is the arrival of some strange new neighbors. Col. Frank Fitts is a retired Marine who's feelings are so repressed he's become a walking time bomb. His wife has retreated into a haunting, silent world of her own. Teenage son Ricky is obsessed with videotaping everything he encounters, including Jane. He supports his hobby by dealing vast quantities of dope. Soon Jane and Ricky have a thing going, and everything climaxes for all involved in one bizarre night of the most memorable and improabable miscommunications.Is this a comedy or a drama? That's hard to say. Many viewers do not relate to the Burnhams specific problems, but they do identify with their general feelings. In laughing at them, many of us are laughing at ourselves. Take the problem of trying too hard to fit in. There is nothing wrong with doing this, unless you lose your own identity in the process. And many would agree that, while there is nothing fundamentally wrong with being American, there is currently something fundamentally wrong with American life. Personally, I think it has less to do with moral issues than it does with a basic spiritual emptiness that comes with being obsessed with external appearances and with material goods.American Beauty is a brilliant movie and, to me, probably was the best American film of 1999. Like a few others before it, it stands uniquely on its own, owing very little to movies that came before it. I love the way it peels away the layers of the Burnhams' lives like onions. I admire its essentially nonjudgmental point of view. Best of all, I like the way that everyone is somehow redeemed at the end. Its a movie that makes you wish there were a few more great ones like it out there.",5,On My Top Ten List for 1999,1016496000,"03 19, 2002",2002,4653,"['first', 'time', 'saw', 'now', 'famous', 'poster', 'American', 'Beauty', 'was', 'months', 'opened', 'was', 'going', 'down', 'escalator', 'posh', 'local', 'multiplex', 'was', 'end', 'descent', 'looked', 'red', 'roses', 'adorning', 'actresses', 'midsection', 'remarked', 'friend', 'looked', 'very', 'special', 'movie', 'do', ""n't"", 'what', 'was', 'artwork', 'made', 'say', 'turned', 'out', 'be', 'accurate', 'remark', 'movie', 'opened', 'limited', 'engagement', 'September', '1999', 'went', 'build', 'build', 'March', 'won', 'Oscars', 'major', 'categories', 'Best', 'Picture', 'Best', 'Actor', '[', 'Kevin', 'Spacey', ']', 'Best', 'Director', 'time', 'were', 'nay-sayers', 'who', 'said', 'film', 'painted', 'too', 'dark', 'picture', 'American', 'life', 'wo', ""n't"", 'debate', 'will', 'say', 'are', 'precedents', 'Academy', 'Awards', 'example', 'Billy', 'Wilder', 'Apartment', 'scathing', 'comedy', 'how', 'morally', 'low', 'people', 'will', 'go', 'move', 'up', 'corporate', 'life', 'won', 'Best', 'Picture', '1961', 'Brilliant', 'brilliant', 'matter', 'what', 'subject', 'America', 'had', 'seriously', 'cynical', 'side', 'decades.Welcome', 'Burnham', 'household', 'Meet', 'Lester', 'Carolyn', '[', 'Spacey', 'Annette', 'Bening', ']', 'lovely', 'teenage', 'daughter', 'Jane', '[', 'Thora', 'Birch', ']', 'Burnhams', 'have', 'lucrative', 'jobs', 'topflight', 'public', 'schools', 'perfect', 'suburban', 'home', 'immaculate', 'lawn', 'borders', 'American', 'beauty', 'roses', 'What', 'could', 'possibly', 'be', 'missing', 'lives', 'Oh', 'just', 'little', 'things', 'happiness', 'fulfillment', 'Lester', 'Carolyn', 'certainly', 'no', 'longer', 'love', 'other', 'Theirs', 'uneasy', 'truce', 'surface', 'Jane', 'across', 'snide', 'ungrateful', 'child', 'have', 'ask', 'who', 'would', ""n't"", 'be', 'eager', 'leave', 'dismal', 'scene', 'How', 'often', 'many', 'point', 'finger', 'children', 'when', 'what', 'are', 'showing', 'are', 'devoid', 'love', 'passion', 'honestly', 'integrity.Jane', 'cheerleader', 'local', 'high', 'school', 'one', 'night', 'Burnhams', 'decide', 'attend', 'game', 'want', 'show', 'support', 'daughter', 'who', 'truly', ""n't"", 'want', 'there', 'Lester', 'cheerleader', 'friend', 'Jane', 'instantly', 'lust', 'obsessed', 'girl', 'job', 'blackmails', 'boss', 'giving', '60,000', 'severance', 'pay', 'red', 'Pontiac', 'Firebird', 'Carolyn', 'who', 'constantly', 'not', 'being', 'success', 'retaliates', 'starting', 'affair', 'arch', 'rival', 'real', 'estate', 'business', 'actions', 'are', 'not', 'exactly', 'what', 'appear', 'be', 'Lester', 'pursuit', ""n't"", 'older', 'man', '/', 'young', 'girl', 'relationships', 'loss', 'youth', 'passion', 'dire', 'consequences', 'can', 'be', 'spawned', 'living', 'whole', 'lifetime', 'fitting', 'Carolyn', 'totally', 'lost', 'controlnot', 'just', 'Lester', 'Jane', 'life', 'whole', 'think', 'are', 'same', 'answers', 'only', 'Lester', 'brutally', 'honest', 'approach', 'now', 'Jane', 'really', 'ready', 'split.Compounding', 'problems', 'arrival', 'strange', 'new', 'neighbors', 'Col.', 'Frank', 'Fitts', 'retired', 'Marine', 'who', 'feelings', 'are', 'so', 'repressed', 'become', 'walking', 'time', 'bomb', 'wife', 'retreated', 'haunting', 'silent', 'world', 'own', 'Teenage', 'son', 'Ricky', 'obsessed', 'videotaping', 'everything', 'including', 'Jane', 'hobby', 'dealing', 'vast', 'quantities', 'dope', 'Soon', 'Jane', 'Ricky', 'have', 'thing', 'going', 'everything', 'climaxes', 'involved', 'one', 'bizarre', 'night', 'most', 'memorable', 'improabable', 'miscommunications.Is', 'comedy', 'drama', 'hard', 'say', 'Many', 'viewers', 'do', 'not', 'relate', 'Burnhams', 'specific', 'problems', 'do', 'identify', 'general', 'feelings', 'laughing', 'many', 'are', 'laughing', 'Take', 'problem', 'trying', 'too', 'hard', 'fit', 'nothing', 'wrong', 'doing', 'lose', 'own', 'identity', 'process', 'many', 'would', 'agree', 'nothing', 'fundamentally', 'wrong', 'being', 'American', 'currently', 'something', 'fundamentally', 'wrong', 'American', 'life', 'Personally', 'think', 'less', 'do', 'moral', 'issues', 'basic', 'spiritual', 'emptiness', 'being', 'obsessed', 'external', 'appearances', 'material', 'goods.American', 'Beauty', 'brilliant', 'movie', 'probably', 'was', 'best', 'American', 'film', '1999', 'few', 'others', 'uniquely', 'own', 'owing', 'very', 'little', 'movies', 'came', 'love', 'way', 'away', 'layers', 'Burnhams', 'lives', 'onions', 'admire', 'essentially', 'nonjudgmental', 'point', 'view', 'Best', 'like', 'way', 'everyone', 'somehow', 'redeemed', 'end', 'movie', 'wish', 'were', 'few', 'more', 'great', 'ones', 'there']",Belleza Americana American Beauty  VHS
67756,A3QE8SFOXRVI0D,0783239408,Matthew McGrath,"[7, 8]","In my opinion, American Beauty is one of the greatest films ever made.  It's got everything...great acting, a terrific plot (some say it's contrived, but I say that's ridiculous), fantastic cinematography, and fabulous symbolisms throughout.  Kevin Spacey turns in his best performance yet (in my opinion) as Lester, the ""middle aged, can't stand my boring corporate job, there's got to be more to life than this, my wife is a money-grubbing freak"" man that will try anything to break free from his monotonous lifestyle.  The movie functions around the phrase ""Look Closer.""  In fact a sign with that phrase is posted on Lester's cubicle wall at work.  The premise behind this phrase is that from the outside, everyone appears to be normal, but it's not until you see life from a much closer point of view when you find that everyone has their own quirks and idiosyncratic shortcomings that make life out to be very challenging.There are so many memorable quotes from this film.

Big house in a nice neighborhood, 2 cars, pretty wife and daughter, and a good job. But on the inside, he's miserable. His job sucks and he has to answer to a younger boss that hasn't even been there a few months. His wife is cold `b' and doesn't even want to have sex with him. His daughter hates him for reasons unknown. And he just really doesn't even like himself that much either. Then one day, he goes to a basketball game with his wife Carolyn (Annette Bening) to watch his daughter Jane (Thora Birch) do her performance in her cheerleading squad. That day changes his life on the spot. He sees Angela (Mena Suvari), Jane's friend, out on the court also, and he realizes his life is in a rut and he wants to be free from it. He quits his job and starts to work out again (mainly to get Angela's attention). He sells his car to get the car of his dreams. And he starts to smoke pot.Luckily his new next door neighbor, Ricky Fitts (Wes Bentley) is a pot dealer. Not only a pot dealer but a weird documentarian that goes to school with Jane. Ricky's dad is a tough father who is also a homophobic Colonel in the marine corp. He loves his son, but sure doesn't know how to show it correctly. Though Ricky and Jane start to like each other, the interactions between Ricky and Lester leave the dad to wondering what is really going on between the two.Carolyn, though a coldhearted `B', used to not be what she is today. She was once a fun loving free spirited girl, but Lester has no clue where that girl went. She's so wrapped up in her real estate business she doesn't even think of Lester anymore. Her arch nemesis in the biz is Buddy Kane, and even though she tries her best to beat the man, nothing works and it makes her incredibly stressed out.  As Lester is trying to work out his mid-life crisis, his wife Carolyn is working out her stress in a much different way.American Beauty is such a great movie. The way it looks into the soul of the normal suburbanite family is really funny and great. Nothing is perfect no matter how it looks. Somedays I really feel like Lester even though I'm not married or have kids. Where I'm just stuck doing the same thing every day and then `BAM', I go a little crazy and break out of that shell. I've even quit my job before because of this. Thank God to, because now I'm much happier. Though you can't help but feel bad for Lester. At least I do. He did so much to support his family, to have them only hate him in the end. Sure he's not always there for his daughter, but that's no reason to be hated. She actually joked about killing him. Seriously... what the heck. Her life could be a million times worse. And his wife, ugh, I'm not even going to go into it. How a woman could do what she does to him is ridiculous. And even though Ricky Fitts is friggin crazy, he's still a cool character. I don't buy into that whole `deep' and `emo' stuff he says about floating bags and dead people/animals, but how he's so blunt about things makes me really like that character.In the end, I would definitely watch this movie.

It's disturbing... and yet, it's extremely provocative and deep.  The film is an extraordinary achievement that reveals a tragic and realistic story about a family that is anything but ordinary.  It's a film with so many layers that it is almost impossible to dissect them all in one single thought.Meet Lester Burnham; a man who feels like he's completely dead inside.  His wife and daughter despise him and do not show him any signs of respect.  On the surface, the family seems like a picture-perfect family that everybody dreams about--but inside is a completely different matter.  His wife is obsessed with material possessions and doesn't care for &quot;petty&quot; things like love or life, while his daughter resents herself because she isn't &quot;perfect.&quot;  Lester's mental coma is rudely interrupted when he meets his daughter's friend and starts fantasizing about her.  The awakening might be due to a disturbing thought or feeling, but the wake-up call changes Lester and allows him to realize that there's always time to erase his &quot;forced-image&quot; and be the person he really is.  This is all a set-up for a funny, disturbing and tragic movie.I don't know about everybody else, but my mind was literally racing around when this movie was playing before my eyes.  It's one of those films that allows you to pick up on something different upon each viewing.  As I said in the beginning of the review, this film has a number of layers to it.  There's so many different meanings and points to the film that it is nearly impossible to describe them all in one little review.  Besides, the fun part of the movie is discovering these meanings and points for yourself.  You know a film is successful when you totally lose yourself to it and allow it to challenge you in every way.  The film is crafted flawlessly and doesn't have a wasted minute in it.The acting from Kevin Spacey is really a sight to see.  He gives his character all of the right needs and feelings that is necessary for the authenticity of his role.  You don't even look at him as an actor--but as the real person he portrays.  It is certainly a milestone in his acting career that will continue to be remembered throughout all cinematic history.  Annette Bening is also superb in her role and brings life to her character, as well.  Everybody in the film should be applauded, as they all make the film what it is.The DVD has some neat features to offer.  The picture quality is fantastic and the sound is more than great.  You have the option of watching the movie in DTS if your system is able to play it.  Extras included are commentary from the director and writer, a behind-the-scenes featurette, cast and crew biographies, trailers and more.  While I wouldn't had mind a Two-Disc edition of the movie, this is a pretty impressive package overall.&quot;American Beauty&quot; is a breath-taking masterpiece with a very high replay value.  It's a terrific film on every front and does not disappoint for a single second.  While it's not a movie that everybody will like, it's most certainly one to check out if you are a lover of films.  If you're looking for something that isn't so ordinary, then this may be the chance that you are seeking.  I feel that it is a unique and superb film that is very hard to express in words--you'll just have to experience it for yourself. -Michael Crane",5,"&quot;...And in a way, I am dead already.&quot;",1075852800,"02 4, 2004",2004,3465,"['quot', 'American', 'Beauty', 'quot', 'pure', 'cinematic', 'triumph', 'funny', 'sad', 'disturbing', 'yet', 'extremely', 'provocative', 'deep', 'film', 'extraordinary', 'achievement', 'tragic', 'realistic', 'story', 'family', 'anything', 'ordinary', 'film', 'so', 'many', 'layers', 'almost', 'impossible', 'dissect', 'one', 'single', 'thought.Meet', 'Lester', 'Burnham', 'man', 'who', 'completely', 'dead', 'inside', 'wife', 'daughter', 'despise', 'do', 'not', 'show', 'signs', 'respect', 'surface', 'family', 'picture-perfect', 'family', 'everybody', 'inside', 'completely', 'different', 'matter', 'wife', 'obsessed', 'material', 'possessions', ""n't"", 'care', 'quot', 'quot', 'things', 'love', 'life', 'daughter', 'resents', ""n't"", 'quot', 'quot', 'Lester', 'mental', 'coma', 'rudely', 'interrupted', 'when', 'daughter', 'friend', 'fantasizing', 'awakening', 'might', 'be', 'due', 'disturbing', 'thought', 'feeling', 'wake-up', 'call', 'changes', 'Lester', 'realize', 'always', 'time', 'erase', 'quot', 'forced-image', 'quot', 'be', 'person', 'really', 'set-up', 'funny', 'disturbing', 'tragic', 'movie.I', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'everybody', 'else', 'mind', 'was', 'literally', 'racing', 'around', 'when', 'movie', 'was', 'playing', 'eyes', 'one', 'films', 'pick', 'up', 'something', 'different', 'viewing', 'said', 'beginning', 'review', 'film', 'number', 'layers', 'so', 'many', 'different', 'meanings', 'points', 'film', 'nearly', 'impossible', 'describe', 'one', 'little', 'review', 'fun', 'part', 'movie', 'discovering', 'meanings', 'points', 'know', 'film', 'successful', 'when', 'totally', 'lose', 'allow', 'challenge', 'way', 'film', 'crafted', 'flawlessly', ""n't"", 'have', 'wasted', 'minute', 'it.The', 'acting', 'Kevin', 'Spacey', 'really', 'sight', 'see', 'character', 'right', 'needs', 'feelings', 'necessary', 'authenticity', 'role', 'do', ""n't"", 'even', 'look', 'actor', 'real', 'person', 'certainly', 'milestone', 'acting', 'career', 'will', 'continue', 'be', 'remembered', 'cinematic', 'history', 'Annette', 'Bening', 'also', 'superb', 'role', 'life', 'character', 'as', 'well', 'Everybody', 'film', 'should', 'be', 'applauded', 'make', 'film', 'what', 'is.The', 'DVD', 'neat', 'features', 'offer', 'picture', 'quality', 'fantastic', 'sound', 'more', 'great', 'have', 'option', 'watching', 'movie', 'DTS', 'system', 'able', 'play', 'Extras', 'included', 'are', 'commentary', 'director', 'writer', 'behind-the-scenes', 'featurette', 'cast', 'crew', 'biographies', 'trailers', 'more', 'would', ""n't"", 'had', 'mind', 'Two-Disc', 'edition', 'movie', 'pretty', 'impressive', 'package', 'overall.', 'quot', 'American', 'Beauty', 'quot', 'breath-taking', 'masterpiece', 'very', 'high', 'replay', 'value', 'terrific', 'film', 'front', 'not', 'disappoint', 'single', 'second', 'not', 'movie', 'everybody', 'will', 'like', 'most', 'certainly', 'one', 'check', 'out', 'are', 'lover', 'films', ""'re"", 'looking', 'something', ""n't"", 'so', 'ordinary', 'then', 'may', 'be', 'chance', 'are', 'seeking', 'feel', 'unique', 'superb', 'film', 'very', 'hard', 'express', 'words', ""'ll"", 'just', 'have', 'experience', '-Michael', 'Crane']",Belleza Americana American Beauty  VHS

Kevin Spacey leads an excellent cast, including, Annette Benning, as his shrewish ***** of a wife, Thora Birch and Mena Suvari, are also good, as well as Chris Cooper, who's ex-military father character, and who is more than a bit obsessed with his son's life, is a scary fellow.  Kevin Spacey rules, as a man who wants to be happy, and through his attempts at happiness, reverting to an earlier time in his life, to impress the young hottie (played by Suvari) become a tragic, comic, figure.  Benning also seeks happiness, in the arms of a fellow real estate broker, but ultimately feels unfulfilled. The rest of the cast, including a low-key, plain, mousy, performance by a pre-West Wing Allison Janney, are excellent.  It's a very twisted story, but a good one (with a decent soundtrack).  The special edition features a second tape with behind the scenes interviews and other features.  It might be too technical for those not interested in all the details, but might make an interesting study for film students, seeing the genius of a first time (film) director.

Angela for her part is attention starved and seeks to realize her needs through sexual actions. His daughter strikes up a relationship with a voyeristic cameraman who is selling drugs behind the back of his Marine father, who disdains gay people, but reveals towards the end of the movie that he himself is gay. The end is perplexing at first because there are several people who may want Lester dead from a sullen wife who is ""refusing to be a victim,"" the gay marine, his daughter's voyaristic boyfriend acting on the wishes of his girlfriend (Lester's daughter.)

67766,A1RPTVW5VEOSI,0783239408,Michael J. Edelman,"[7, 11]","""American Beauty"" is certainly one of the most beautifully filmed movies of its time, and contains a number of great performances from actors like Chris Cooper and Kevin Spacey. Watching it, it's easy to be drawn in by the visuals and the stunning score. But behind all that lies an empty script that offers no insights, no development, and most of all, no subtlety.From the beginning we're told by the narrator that he's a dead man- so what from that point, we're just waiting to see how exactly he buys it. It's a cheap trick, and one that removes much of the need to develop the plot; we're left with a number of trivial stories that don't tell us anything or advance the plot. When Spacey's death comes, it's like the punchline to a bad joke.There are three narrative threads in this film, none of which gets developed very far: Early on, Spacey's character decides to stop caring about success and becomes infatuated with a teenaged girl. His wife (Anette Benning in her usual stiff attempt at acting) looks elsewhere for money and affection. Their daughter looks for love from the neighborhood dope dealer, who lives with a stereotypically emotionally numb mother and a father who's a caricature of the retired military non-com. And that's really it.The story unfolds in a very stagey and unnatural way, relying on  music and an excess of gimmicky camera shots to make the transition from one scene to the next. There's an unnaturalness about the whole enterprise that really keeps the viewer from becoming emotionally involved with any of the characters. It's not unlike watching an ant farm.So three stars for the score and the peformances by Cooper and Spacey, and none for the story or direction.",3,"Beautiful, stylish, and empty",1135209600,"12 22, 2005",2005,1706,"['American', 'Beauty', 'certainly', 'one', 'most', 'beautifully', 'filmed', 'movies', 'time', 'number', 'great', 'performances', 'actors', 'Chris', 'Cooper', 'Kevin', 'Spacey', 'Watching', 'easy', 'be', 'drawn', 'visuals', 'stunning', 'score', 'empty', 'script', 'insights', 'development', 'most', 'subtlety.From', 'beginning', ""'re"", 'told', 'narrator', 'dead', 'man-', 'so', 'what', 'point', ""'re"", 'just', 'waiting', 'see', 'how', 'exactly', 'cheap', 'trick', 'one', 'much', 'need', 'develop', 'plot', ""'re"", 'left', 'number', 'trivial', 'stories', 'do', ""n't"", 'tell', 'anything', 'advance', 'plot', 'When', 'Spacey', 'death', 'punchline', 'bad', 'joke.There', 'are', 'three', 'narrative', 'threads', 'film', 'none', 'developed', 'very', 'far', 'Early', 'Spacey', 'character', 'stop', 'caring', 'success', 'becomes', 'infatuated', 'teenaged', 'girl', 'wife', 'Anette', 'Benning', 'usual', 'stiff', 'attempt', 'acting', 'elsewhere', 'money', 'affection', 'daughter', 'love', 'neighborhood', 'dope', 'dealer', 'who', 'stereotypically', 'emotionally', 'numb', 'mother', 'father', 'who', 'caricature', 'retired', 'military', 'non-com', 'really', 'it.The', 'story', 'unfolds', 'very', 'stagey', 'unnatural', 'way', 'relying', 'music', 'excess', 'gimmicky', 'camera', 'shots', 'make', 'transition', 'one', 'scene', 'next', 'unnaturalness', 'whole', 'enterprise', 'really', 'viewer', 'becoming', 'emotionally', 'involved', 'characters', 'not', 'watching', 'ant', 'farm.So', 'three', 'stars', 'score', 'peformances', 'Cooper', 'Spacey', 'none', 'story', 'direction']",Belleza Americana American Beauty  VHS

I feel so sorry for Lester in the movie, his wife couldn't care less about him, and she is also cheating on him. His daughter can't stand him and feels he is an idiot. Then he finally realizes that after all of his downhill happenings he actually feels good about himself, and then he dies. The montage after he was shot was the most moving scene for me in the movie. It went from his most fond memories of life, and the things most important to him while all the time showing the emotion and reaction of his friends and family towards his death. This movie deserved every applause or good review. It is by far my favorite movie of all time, for some reason I am always drawn to it when I feel like watching a DVD.

He is the main character in this excellent  movie about suburban America. Starring Annette Bening and Kevin Spacey this  movie makes you laugh as you get pulled into its wonderful story.  Kevin  Spacey stars as Lester Burnham, a husband and father who decides to pursue  a life in smoking pot, working at a fast food restaurant, and chasing after  a high school girl who happens to be her daughter's best friend.  Meanwhile his wife (Annette Bening), a real estate salesman, is also having  a nervous breakdown.  She cheats on Lester with some other guy who is also  in real estate.  This provides one of the most amusing scenes in the movie  when Bening is making out in a van with that guy and they are driving  through a fast food place; the place where Lester works.  He catches them  red-handed and its just, hilarious.  The Burnham's neighbors also have a  large part in the movie even though they are just basically supporting the  Burnham family's characters.  They are also a three-person family.  The  father is abusive and prejudice, the mother just takes it all and doesn't  say a word, and their son (newcomer Wes Bentley) is Lester's drug-dealer  and also becomes his daughter's girlfriend.  From what I have written I  hope you can decide if you are interested in this movie.  I would not  recommend it to people easily offended.  I would recommend it to people who  like dark comedies.

There's a little of each of us in these characters.Anyone who lives in a fairly affluent suburban neighborhood knows people like the Annette Bening character, who prunes red roses with matching red shoes and gardening tools, and who is so uptight about her Martha Stewart-wannabe lifestyle that she won't fool around on the couch (God forbid they stain it).And, yes, I see a lot of Lester Burnham (Kevin Spacey) in just about all of my neighbors, and in myself. How often have we wanted to shuck our jobs, smoke dope all day, buy a red 1971 Firebird, and chase cute young thangs? We all have, folks...fess up. The difference is that most of us never act on it; Lester does, and though it's a pure, adolescent prank at first, it eventually becomes something of a trip of self-discovery that leads indirectly to Lester's undoing.It takes guts to do what you want to do, folks, and sometimes you pay the price, which Lester does...with his life. And although Lester reconnects with himself by the end of his life, he never reconnects with his wife (I suspect he doesn't want to), or his daughter, a girl so desperate for meaning and guidance that it's painful to watch.&quot;American Beauty&quot; is hypnotic for a reason - to one extent or another, it shows us OUR lives. How can one not fail to be hypnotized by our lives on the big screen? How can you not wish you had the guts to do what Lester does?Some have criticized this film for its cynical view of suburbia, but I see it as a challenge to move beyond typical concepts of happiness - all of which revolve around money and belongings in our culture - and decide what's really important for you.I find that message uplifting.",5,"By far, the best film of 1999...",973555200,"11 7, 2000",2000,1942,"['quot', 'American', 'Beauty', 'quot', 'story', 'people', 'who', ""'ve"", 'given', 'up', 'dreams', 'very', 'inner', 'selves', 'lifestyle.To', 'certain', 'extent', 'fellow', 'readers', 'one', 'what', 'film', 'so', 'haunting', 'effective', 'little', 'characters.Anyone', 'who', 'fairly', 'affluent', 'suburban', 'neighborhood', 'people', 'Annette', 'Bening', 'character', 'who', 'red', 'roses', 'matching', 'red', 'shoes', 'gardening', 'tools', 'who', 'so', 'uptight', 'Martha', 'Stewart-wannabe', 'lifestyle', 'wo', ""n't"", 'fool', 'around', 'couch', 'God', 'stain', 'yes', 'see', 'lot', 'Lester', 'Burnham', 'Kevin', 'Spacey', 'just', 'neighbors', 'How', 'often', 'have', 'wanted', 'shuck', 'jobs', 'smoke', 'dope', 'day', 'buy', 'red', '1971', 'Firebird', 'chase', 'cute', 'young', 'thangs', 'have', 'folks', 'fess', 'up', 'difference', 'most', 'never', 'act', 'Lester', 'pure', 'adolescent', 'prank', 'first', 'eventually', 'something', 'trip', 'self-discovery', 'indirectly', 'Lester', 'undoing.It', 'guts', 'do', 'what', 'want', 'do', 'folks', 'sometimes', 'pay', 'price', 'Lester', 'life', 'Lester', 'end', 'life', 'never', 'wife', 'suspect', ""n't"", 'want', 'daughter', 'girl', 'so', 'desperate', 'meaning', 'guidance', 'painful', 'watch.', 'quot', 'American', 'Beauty', 'quot', 'hypnotic', 'reason', 'one', 'extent', 'OUR', 'How', 'can', 'one', 'not', 'fail', 'be', 'hypnotized', 'lives', 'big', 'screen', 'How', 'can', 'not', 'wish', 'had', 'guts', 'do', 'what', 'Lester', 'have', 'criticized', 'film', 'cynical', 'view', 'suburbia', 'see', 'challenge', 'move', 'typical', 'concepts', 'happiness', 'revolve', 'money', 'belongings', 'culture', 'decide', 'what', 'really', 'important', 'you.I', 'find', 'message', 'uplifting']",Belleza Americana American Beauty  VHS

Two words immediately spring to mind: DISAPPOINTMENT and OUTRAGE.  DISAPPOINTMENT, because the film simply lacks the requisite quality for the manifold awards and laurels it has received, and OUTRAGE, because this movie is billed as a &quot;provocative and wickedly funny&quot; satire, and a &quot;defining achievement in cinematic history.&quot; Provocative, indeed, it is; &quot;wickedly funny,&quot; and &quot;a defining achievement,&quot; it most certainly is NOT!&quot;American Beauty&quot;  is a film which purports to make a stinging social commentary about the barrenness of American life at the dawn of a new millennium, and the need for people to wake up and see beauty in their surroundings.  The vehicle for this message is ironically a pair of dysfunctional suburban families.  Meet the Burnhams:  Lester, a middle-aged &quot;burn-out&quot; at work; completely alienated from his hyperkinetic and overambitious wife, Carolyn, and his moody teenage daughter, Jane.  Meet also the Fittses:  Frank, a retired Marine Corps colonel - a rabid homophobe and an abusive &quot;control freak&quot; toward his voyeuristic, detached teenage son, Ricky, and his semi-catatonic wife, Barbara.In a film which somehow seeks to educate its viewers on the beauty of life, we have scenarios like these placed before us:  Lester lusts after his daughter's girlfriend, a teenager with a wildly scatological mouth. He quits his $60,000 a year job and  takes a  job flipping burgers at a fast food joint, he buys his &quot;dream car,&quot; and he begins smoking pot.  Carolyn begins a torrid affair with a rival real estate agent, a fact which doesn't seem to bother Lester at all when he finds out about it.  Frank forces Ricky to give urine samples to test for drug use, and, fearing that his son is gay, beats on him repeatedly.  Jane begins sleeping with Ricky, and suggests he put her lecherous father &quot;out of his misery.&quot;All this in the name of &quot;beauty.&quot;&quot;American Beauty&quot; is billed as a &quot;wickedly funny&quot; satire.  Now, when I read or hear the word &quot;satire,&quot; I immediately associate it with the word &quot;humor.&quot; That humor can be black, acerbic, biting, ironic, or dry...it doesn't matter.  My point is, I believe that satire, in order to be effective, must be imbued with at least a modicum of humor.  And humor is one quality &quot;American Beauty&quot; does not possess.I find nothing funny about  a 42-year old man engaging in overtly lewd daydreams about, and sexual overtures toward, a teenage girl;  nothing funny about  a homophobic, bigoted father forcing his son to give urine samples to test for drug use, or repeatedly beating on him for infractions of his &quot;rules;&quot;  nothing funny about a man threatening violence toward his wife by throwing a platterful of asparagus at the dining room wall;  nothing funny about a teenage daughter wanting to see her father dead.The only scenes in the entire movie which rise to the level of humor - albeit humor of the blackest variety - are the sex scene between Carolyn Burnham and Buddy Kane, the &quot;Real Estate King.&quot; That, and the scene when newly cuckolded, burger-flipping Lester catches his wife with her aforementioned partner. Those scenes did, in fact, evoke from me a wry chuckle or two.Now, I will concede, that &quot;American Beauty&quot; is an artistically and technically brilliant film. Kevin Spacey, Annette Bening, Thora Birch, Mena Suvari, Chris Cooper, and Wes Bently all excel in their roles. Spacey may even have deserved his Oscar. The cinematography is superb. The screenplay is eloquent and lyrical.  Put these things together, and what you should come up with a masterpiece. Film critics, the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences, and the public at large all seem to think that's exactly what they've got...a masterpiece, I mean.Alas, I do not share in that sentiment. For the life of me, I cannot understand why &quot;American Beauty&quot; remains such a critical and box-office success. Throughout this film's two hour, two minute running time, it remained for me little more than a lame attempt at witty social commentary, and a plodding, dreary film which was a drudgery to sit through.",2,&quot;American Dreadful&quot;,971222400,"10 11, 2000",2000,4410,"['viewing', 'quot', 'American', 'Beauty', 'quot', 'VHS', 'found', 'confronted', 'most', 'viscerally', 'negative', 'reaction', 'can', 'ever', 'recall', 'experiencing', 'film', 'Two', 'words', 'immediately', 'spring', 'mind', 'DISAPPOINTMENT', 'OUTRAGE', 'DISAPPOINTMENT', 'film', 'simply', 'requisite', 'quality', 'manifold', 'awards', 'laurels', 'received', 'OUTRAGE', 'movie', 'billed', 'quot', 'provocative', 'wickedly', 'funny', 'quot', 'satire', 'quot', 'defining', 'achievement', 'cinematic', 'history.', 'quot', 'Provocative', 'indeed', 'quot', 'wickedly', 'quot', 'quot', 'defining', 'achievement', 'quot', 'most', 'certainly', 'NOT', 'quot', 'American', 'Beauty', 'quot', 'film', 'make', 'stinging', 'social', 'commentary', 'barrenness', 'American', 'life', 'dawn', 'new', 'millennium', 'need', 'people', 'wake', 'up', 'see', 'beauty', 'surroundings', 'vehicle', 'message', 'ironically', 'pair', 'dysfunctional', 'suburban', 'families', 'Meet', 'Burnhams', 'Lester', 'middle-aged', 'quot', 'burn-out', 'quot', 'work', 'completely', 'alienated', 'hyperkinetic', 'overambitious', 'wife', 'Carolyn', 'moody', 'teenage', 'daughter', 'Jane', 'Meet', 'also', 'Fittses', 'Frank', 'retired', 'Marine', 'Corps', 'colonel', 'rabid', 'homophobe', 'abusive', 'quot', 'control', 'freak', 'quot', 'voyeuristic', 'detached', 'teenage', 'son', 'Ricky', 'semi-catatonic', 'wife', 'Barbara.In', 'film', 'somehow', 'educate', 'viewers', 'beauty', 'life', 'have', 'scenarios', 'placed', 'Lester', 'lusts', 'daughter', 'girlfriend', 'teenager', 'wildly', 'scatological', 'mouth', '60,000', 'year', 'job', 'job', 'flipping', 'burgers', 'fast', 'food', 'joint', 'quot', 'dream', 'car', 'quot', 'smoking', 'pot', 'Carolyn', 'torrid', 'affair', 'rival', 'real', 'estate', 'agent', 'fact', ""n't"", 'seem', 'bother', 'Lester', 'when', 'out', 'Frank', 'forces', 'Ricky', 'give', 'urine', 'samples', 'test', 'drug', 'use', 'fearing', 'son', 'gay', 'beats', 'repeatedly', 'Jane', 'sleeping', 'Ricky', 'put', 'lecherous', 'father', 'quot', 'misery.', 'quot', 'name', 'quot', 'quot', 'quot', 'American', 'Beauty', 'quot', 'billed', 'quot', 'wickedly', 'funny', 'quot', 'satire', 'Now', 'when', 'read', 'hear', 'word', 'quot', 'satire', 'quot', 'immediately', 'associate', 'word', 'quot', 'quot', 'humor', 'can', 'be', 'black', 'acerbic', 'biting', 'ironic', 'dry', ""n't"", 'matter', 'point', 'believe', 'satire', 'order', 'be', 'effective', 'must', 'be', 'imbued', 'least', 'modicum', 'humor', 'humor', 'one', 'quality', 'quot', 'American', 'Beauty', 'quot', 'not', 'possess.I', 'find', 'nothing', 'funny', '42-year', 'old', 'man', 'engaging', 'overtly', 'lewd', 'daydreams', 'sexual', 'overtures', 'teenage', 'girl', 'nothing', 'homophobic', 'bigoted', 'father', 'forcing', 'son', 'give', 'urine', 'samples', 'test', 'drug', 'use', 'repeatedly', 'beating', 'infractions', 'quot', 'rules', 'quot', 'nothing', 'man', 'threatening', 'violence', 'wife', 'throwing', 'platterful', 'asparagus', 'dining', 'room', 'wall', 'nothing', 'teenage', 'daughter', 'wanting', 'see', 'father', 'dead.The', 'only', 'entire', 'movie', 'rise', 'level', 'humor', 'humor', 'blackest', 'variety', 'are', 'sex', 'scene', 'Carolyn', 'Burnham', 'Buddy', 'Kane', 'quot', 'Real', 'Estate', 'King.', 'quot', 'scene', 'when', 'newly', 'cuckolded', 'burger-flipping', 'Lester', 'wife', 'aforementioned', 'partner', 'scenes', 'did', 'fact', 'evoke', 'wry', 'chuckle', 'two.Now', 'will', 'concede', 'quot', 'American', 'Beauty', 'quot', 'artistically', 'technically', 'brilliant', 'film', 'Kevin', 'Spacey', 'Annette', 'Bening', 'Thora', 'Birch', 'Mena', 'Suvari', 'Chris', 'Cooper', 'Wes', 'Bently', 'excel', 'roles', 'Spacey', 'may', 'even', 'have', 'deserved', 'Oscar', 'cinematography', 'superb', 'screenplay', 'eloquent', 'lyrical', 'Put', 'things', 'together', 'what', 'should', 'come', 'up', 'masterpiece', 'Film', 'critics', 'Academy', 'Motion', 'Picture', 'Arts', 'Sciences', 'public', 'large', 'seem', 'think', 'exactly', 'what', ""'ve"", 'got', 'masterpiece', 'mean.Alas', 'do', 'not', 'share', 'sentiment', 'life', 'can', 'not', 'understand', 'why', 'quot', 'American', 'Beauty', 'quot', 'critical', 'box-office', 'success', 'film', 'two', 'hour', 'two', 'minute', 'running', 'time', 'remained', 'little', 'more', 'lame', 'attempt', 'witty', 'social', 'commentary', 'plodding', 'dreary', 'film', 'was', 'drudgery', 'sit']",Belleza Americana American Beauty  VHS

The white picket fence can only hide so much from view before the dark secrets are finally uncovered.The Thomas Newman musical score is evocative with a hovering sense of sweet melancholy, yet it has a thoroughly haunting,  icy-edged poignancy that cannot be resisted; it reflectively explores the hollow rewards of the death trap known as the rat race with all of its inherent disillusionment.More than a musical underscore, this is a sublimely eloquent work of art by Newman, perhaps his signature best, so very beautiful that when I hear it, it overflows and I don't know how I can possibly hold it all inside.This is a film that is funny, sad, disturbing and strangely beautiful.This movie is new every time I watch it. I never seem to remember everything that it contains,  yet at times it's somehow impossible to forget a single moment.For cinema lovers especially, this motion picture is a masterfully crafted experience.Warning: This movie is not for those who are looking for simple escapist entertainment or for those who tend to hide their head in the sand. It's far from simple and it's uncompromisingly blunt.This is as sly as a film can possibly be, where your soul is given the opportunity to connect all the dots, and you're left to discover the true nature of beauty that's always there in front of us.By any other name...",5,By any other name,1330128000,"02 25, 2012",2012,1685,"['AMERICAN', 'BEAUTY', '1999', 'Kevin', 'Spacey', 'Annette', 'Bening', 'Thora', 'Birch', 'Chris', 'CooperRated', 'R.5', 'Academy', 'awards.Tagline', 'look', 'closer', 'film', 'bothers', ""'re"", 'not', 'alone.It', 'push', 'buttons.The', 'suburban', 'middle', 'class', 'dream', 'sometimes', 'not', 'exactly', 'what', 'be', 'picture', 'perfect', 'surface', 'taken', 'wood', 'shed', 'here', 'white', 'picket', 'fence', 'can', 'only', 'hide', 'so', 'much', 'view', 'dark', 'secrets', 'are', 'finally', 'uncovered.The', 'Thomas', 'Newman', 'musical', 'score', 'evocative', 'hovering', 'sense', 'sweet', 'melancholy', 'thoroughly', 'haunting', 'icy-edged', 'poignancy', 'can', 'not', 'be', 'resisted', 'reflectively', 'hollow', 'rewards', 'death', 'trap', 'known', 'rat', 'race', 'inherent', 'disillusionment.More', 'musical', 'underscore', 'sublimely', 'eloquent', 'work', 'art', 'Newman', 'perhaps', 'signature', 'best', 'so', 'very', 'beautiful', 'when', 'hear', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'how', 'can', 'possibly', 'hold', 'inside.This', 'film', 'funny', 'sad', 'disturbing', 'strangely', 'beautiful.This', 'movie', 'new', 'time', 'watch', 'never', 'seem', 'remember', 'everything', 'yet', 'times', 'somehow', 'impossible', 'forget', 'single', 'moment.For', 'cinema', 'lovers', 'especially', 'motion', 'picture', 'masterfully', 'crafted', 'experience.Warning', 'movie', 'not', 'who', 'are', 'looking', 'simple', 'escapist', 'entertainment', 'who', 'tend', 'hide', 'head', 'sand', 'far', 'simple', 'uncompromisingly', 'blunt.This', 'as', 'sly', 'film', 'can', 'possibly', 'be', 'where', 'soul', 'given', 'opportunity', 'connect', 'dots', ""'re"", 'left', 'discover', 'true', 'nature', 'beauty', 'always', 'there', 'front', 'us.By', 'other', 'name']",Belleza Americana American Beauty  VHS

A stable marriage, a family, a pretty house in a pleasant suburb. A work that offers comfort, security, luxuries and whims. A perfect life, like the stamp of a Kodak photography. The American Dream.And nevertheless, for Lester, Carolyn and Jane Burham, the American dream is a fraud. Meager, without sense, they can barely stand it. The Burham lead lives of calm desperation. They are frustrated, bored. Lester admits feeling like a failure. Carolyn wouldn't do it in a million years. Jane can't see the hour to go away from home.Routine. Emptiness. Boredom. This is the life in the Burham house, until Jane introduces her parents to Angela, her friend at school and gives Lester a bizarre reason to enjoy life again.Angela is transformed into the object of such strong fantasies that they turn Lester into a completely different man. A middle age crisis assaults him, scaring and scandalizing his wife and daughter. Nothing can stop him.Behind each door in the suburbs a volatile world exists, on the brink of madness and self-destruction. That's true or American Beauty is just an isolated case. Not likely.The sharp real world that the director, screenwriter and cast display on screen is as pleasant as it is irritating. Pleasant because it shows an acute observation about the American family lifestyle. Irritating because confronts honestly the hypocrisy that usually surrounds life: the modern values, often hollow, the weaknesses that make us adopt behavior patterns that are not part of our personality, the phobias, prejudices, ambitions, the insecurities that we all feel internally.American Beauty tells us that there is nothing no worse than being ""ordinary"". And what is ordinary? An repressed ex-military man who despises homosexuals? To listen to classical music while we are having dinner? The young girl who uses her appearance to create a goddess image, when in fact, is another afraid adolescent? American beauty dares to explore the meaning of beauty through the eyes of its characters; people who are fighting to have courage enough to get on with their life, day after day.The film is directed with unusual skill for a newcomer, with an intuitive camera. The characters or could be living next door to you, or 3 floors above of your department. Their confusion, their poses, their miseries are not unreal.Annette Bening is sensational as Carolyn, the bitter wife who seduces, scratches, crawls, and cries and flatters to desperately grab some respect. Thora Birch, Mena Suvari and Wes Bentley shine with their own light as Jane, Angela and Ricky. The rest of the cast is magnificent, you will not find a bad performanceeven with a magnifying glass.But the film is, without hesitations, all about Kevin Spacey. His Lester is like many men, and nevertheless, Spacey makes him unique, authentic. A tragic icon of the American man: ingenious, graceful, witty, pathetic and nostalgic of his adolescence.Lester's changes are not simply a middle-age crisis, but a revelation that there's much more to life that he has obtained from. And maybe, as even Lester will realize after this injection of vitality, he's not a loser, but it's already too late for him to win.",4,The fall of the American dream,1116979200,"05 25, 2005",2005,3255,"['look', 'desperately', 'covet', 'perfect', 'couple', 'stable', 'marriage', 'family', 'pretty', 'house', 'pleasant', 'suburb', 'work', 'comfort', 'security', 'luxuries', 'whims', 'perfect', 'life', 'stamp', 'Kodak', 'photography', 'American', 'Dream.And', 'nevertheless', 'Lester', 'Carolyn', 'Jane', 'Burham', 'American', 'dream', 'fraud', 'Meager', 'sense', 'can', 'barely', 'stand', 'Burham', 'lead', 'lives', 'calm', 'desperation', 'are', 'frustrated', 'bored', 'Lester', 'feeling', 'failure', 'Carolyn', 'would', ""n't"", 'do', 'million', 'years', 'Jane', 'ca', ""n't"", 'see', 'hour', 'go', 'away', 'home.Routine', 'Emptiness', 'Boredom', 'life', 'Burham', 'house', 'Jane', 'parents', 'Angela', 'friend', 'school', 'Lester', 'bizarre', 'reason', 'enjoy', 'life', 'again.Angela', 'transformed', 'object', 'such', 'strong', 'fantasies', 'turn', 'Lester', 'completely', 'different', 'man', 'middle', 'age', 'crisis', 'assaults', 'scaring', 'scandalizing', 'wife', 'daughter', 'Nothing', 'can', 'stop', 'him.Behind', 'door', 'suburbs', 'volatile', 'world', 'brink', 'madness', 'self-destruction', 'true', 'American', 'Beauty', 'just', 'isolated', 'case', 'Not', 'likely.The', 'sharp', 'real', 'world', 'director', 'screenwriter', 'cast', 'display', 'screen', 'as', 'pleasant', 'irritating', 'Pleasant', 'acute', 'observation', 'American', 'family', 'lifestyle', 'Irritating', 'confronts', 'honestly', 'hypocrisy', 'usually', 'life', 'modern', 'values', 'often', 'hollow', 'weaknesses', 'make', 'adopt', 'behavior', 'patterns', 'are', 'not', 'part', 'personality', 'phobias', 'prejudices', 'ambitions', 'insecurities', 'feel', 'internally.American', 'Beauty', 'nothing', 'no', 'worse', 'being', 'ordinary', 'what', 'ordinary', 'repressed', 'ex-military', 'man', 'who', 'homosexuals', 'listen', 'classical', 'music', 'are', 'having', 'dinner', 'young', 'girl', 'who', 'appearance', 'create', 'goddess', 'image', 'when', 'fact', 'afraid', 'adolescent', 'American', 'beauty', 'dares', 'explore', 'meaning', 'beauty', 'eyes', 'characters', 'people', 'who', 'are', 'fighting', 'have', 'courage', 'enough', 'get', 'life', 'day', 'day.The', 'film', 'directed', 'unusual', 'skill', 'newcomer', 'intuitive', 'camera', 'characters', 'could', 'be', 'living', 'next', 'door', '3', 'floors', 'department', 'confusion', 'poses', 'miseries', 'are', 'not', 'unreal.Annette', 'Bening', 'sensational', 'Carolyn', 'bitter', 'wife', 'who', 'scratches', 'crawls', 'cries', 'flatters', 'desperately', 'grab', 'respect', 'Thora', 'Birch', 'Mena', 'Suvari', 'Wes', 'Bentley', 'shine', 'own', 'light', 'Jane', 'Angela', 'Ricky', 'rest', 'cast', 'magnificent', 'will', 'not', 'find', 'bad', 'performanceeven', 'magnifying', 'glass.But', 'film', 'hesitations', 'Kevin', 'Spacey', 'Lester', 'many', 'men', 'nevertheless', 'Spacey', 'unique', 'authentic', 'tragic', 'icon', 'American', 'man', 'ingenious', 'graceful', 'witty', 'pathetic', 'nostalgic', 'adolescence.Lester', 'changes', 'are', 'not', 'simply', 'middle-age', 'crisis', 'revelation', 'much', 'more', 'life', 'obtained', 'maybe', 'even', 'Lester', 'will', 'realize', 'injection', 'vitality', 'not', 'loser', 'already', 'too', 'late', 'win']",Belleza Americana American Beauty  VHS

In addition to that, his family (and apparently everyone on his block) are having breakdowns too.In my opinion, this movie would have been better if Kevin Spacey had just walked on screen for a second and said ""life can be crazy at times, so just slow down and see the beauty.""  In fact, that would have been great in comparison to the movie that it really was.My question is where was the reality?  The story is an attempt to reach out to people and show them something they understand or can relate to.  However, the attempt to do just that though fails because there are too many ridiculous sub-plots thrown in: whether it be pedophilia, insecurity with one's homosexuality, power hunger, greed, and lust, or just a lack of reality with the world.Most of these characters would be labeled insane if checked out by doctors, and none of them having anything in connection to the real world.  Kevin Spacey's character is much more like one of Ayn's Rand's characters in that he is the epitome of selfishness (and I like Ayn Rand).Warning: if you want to see a film that covers a similar topic in a better way then watch Life As A House, but if you want to see what all the fuss is about then ask someone.  Because, watching this movie is more then just a waste of one's time, it is a degradation of one's mind.",1,"The horror, the horror...",1105056000,"01 7, 2005",2005,1403,"['movie', 'man', 'Kevin', 'Spacey', 'mid-life', 'crisis', 'offset', 'views', 'life', 'addition', 'family', 'apparently', 'everyone', 'block', 'are', 'having', 'breakdowns', 'too.In', 'opinion', 'movie', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'better', 'Kevin', 'Spacey', 'had', 'just', 'walked', 'screen', 'second', 'said', 'life', 'can', 'be', 'crazy', 'times', 'so', 'just', 'slow', 'down', 'see', 'beauty', 'fact', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'great', 'comparison', 'movie', 'really', 'was.My', 'question', 'where', 'was', 'reality', 'story', 'attempt', 'reach', 'out', 'people', 'show', 'something', 'understand', 'can', 'relate', 'However', 'attempt', 'do', 'just', 'fails', 'are', 'too', 'many', 'ridiculous', 'sub-plots', 'thrown', 'be', 'pedophilia', 'insecurity', 'one', 'homosexuality', 'power', 'hunger', 'greed', 'lust', 'just', 'lack', 'reality', 'world.Most', 'characters', 'would', 'be', 'labeled', 'insane', 'checked', 'out', 'doctors', 'none', 'having', 'anything', 'connection', 'real', 'world', 'Kevin', 'Spacey', 'character', 'much', 'more', 'one', 'Ayn', 'Rand', 'characters', 'epitome', 'selfishness', 'like', 'Ayn', 'Rand', '.Warning', 'want', 'see', 'film', 'similar', 'topic', 'better', 'way', 'then', 'watch', 'Life', 'A', 'House', 'want', 'see', 'what', 'fuss', 'then', 'ask', 'someone', 'watching', 'movie', 'more', 'then', 'just', 'waste', 'one', 'time', 'degradation', 'one', 'mind']",Belleza Americana American Beauty  VHS

Fowler ""ben1283""","[1, 2]","When 'American Beauty' was released it brought fresh life into Hollywood cinema (coupled with 'Fight Club' that same year, we were especially lucky).  Directed by English theatre-director Sam Mendes and written with intense sensitivity by Alan Ball it is one of the great movies of the century.  The story of a disfunctional family, each separated by their own wishes for fulfilment and by the people around them may sound dull but 'American Beauty' breathes a different kind of life into it.It centres around the dry Lester Burnham (Spacey), who narrates the story from beyond the grave.  Stuck in a dead marriage to wife Caroline (Bening) and a boring job he witnesses an epiphany in the shape of Angela, the best friend of his daughter Jane.  Thinking his years after high school to be a waste he starts getting himself in shape, smoking pot and even pursuing Angela.  The amazing thing about this movie is that it doesn't merely focus on Spacey but on all the people around him, each with their own dreams, hopes and failures which Mendes treats with a care and sensitivity unusual to most films.  For instance, Caroline may be pushy but she's cracking up inside, Jane has concerns about her body and even Angela is worried that she might not be perfect after all.Another interesting thing is that Spacey isn't the hero as you'd expect him to be.  Sure we admire him, the guy that decides to take his life by the reigns, but we admire neighbour and Jane's boyfriend Ricky (Bentley) even more.  This is because despite being trapped at home with an abusive father and a mother who is intriguingly unhinged he still feels gratitude for all the beauty that the world has to offer.  If this sounds clich&eacute;d, cheesy or pretentious then you obviously haven't seen the film, which displays all this beauty before our eyes alongside all the misery and heartache.  Add the this the implication that Bentley believes in a higher power guiding us may be as much due to his own wisdom as it is to his horrific home life and it becomes a statement of great weight.Of course, the intelligence of the movie is just one of the many things that make it.  The cinematography constantly emphasises the 'life is beautiful' theme, with gorgeous red roses, blood and voluptuous lipstick all vying for your attention.  In addition, it would be hard to find a collection of actors that are more accomplised in the role they play, all giving the performances of their respective careers.  Spacey is even better than he was in 'The Usual Suspects', Bening shows a different side to the career woman of many movie stereotypes, Birch portrays the disappointment of early adulthood perfectly, Bentley is so astute it's almost disconcerting and Suvari is sublime as the Venus-image/frightened little girl.  Add to the mix a dollop of brilliant humour and you have what is probably one of the most important movies of the 90's, quite possibly even the century.",5,A masterpiece of 90's cinema,1024790400,"06 23, 2002",2002,2939,"['When', ""'American"", 'Beauty', 'was', 'released', 'brought', 'fresh', 'life', 'Hollywood', 'cinema', 'coupled', ""'Fight"", 'Club', 'same', 'year', 'were', 'especially', 'lucky', 'Directed', 'English', 'theatre-director', 'Sam', 'Mendes', 'written', 'intense', 'sensitivity', 'Alan', 'Ball', 'one', 'great', 'movies', 'century', 'story', 'disfunctional', 'family', 'separated', 'own', 'wishes', 'fulfilment', 'people', 'may', 'sound', 'dull', ""'American"", 'Beauty', 'breathes', 'different', 'kind', 'life', 'it.It', 'centres', 'dry', 'Lester', 'Burnham', 'Spacey', 'who', 'story', 'grave', 'Stuck', 'dead', 'marriage', 'wife', 'Caroline', 'Bening', 'boring', 'job', 'epiphany', 'shape', 'Angela', 'best', 'friend', 'daughter', 'Jane', 'Thinking', 'years', 'high', 'school', 'be', 'waste', 'getting', 'shape', 'smoking', 'pot', 'even', 'pursuing', 'Angela', 'amazing', 'thing', 'movie', ""n't"", 'merely', 'focus', 'Spacey', 'people', 'own', 'dreams', 'hopes', 'failures', 'Mendes', 'treats', 'care', 'sensitivity', 'unusual', 'most', 'films', 'instance', 'Caroline', 'may', 'be', 'pushy', 'cracking', 'up', 'inside', 'Jane', 'concerns', 'body', 'even', 'Angela', 'worried', 'might', 'not', 'be', 'perfect', 'all.Another', 'interesting', 'thing', 'Spacey', ""n't"", 'hero', ""'d"", 'expect', 'be', 'Sure', 'admire', 'guy', 'take', 'life', 'reigns', 'admire', 'neighbour', 'Jane', 'boyfriend', 'Ricky', 'Bentley', 'even', 'more', 'being', 'trapped', 'home', 'abusive', 'father', 'mother', 'who', 'intriguingly', 'unhinged', 'still', 'gratitude', 'beauty', 'world', 'offer', 'clich', 'eacute', 'd', 'cheesy', 'pretentious', 'then', 'obviously', 'have', ""n't"", 'seen', 'film', 'beauty', 'eyes', 'misery', 'heartache', 'Add', 'implication', 'Bentley', 'higher', 'power', 'guiding', 'may', 'be', 'as', 'much', 'due', 'own', 'wisdom', 'horrific', 'home', 'life', 'statement', 'great', 'weight.Of', 'course', 'intelligence', 'movie', 'just', 'one', 'many', 'things', 'make', 'cinematography', 'constantly', ""'life"", 'beautiful', 'theme', 'gorgeous', 'red', 'roses', 'blood', 'voluptuous', 'lipstick', 'vying', 'attention', 'addition', 'would', 'be', 'hard', 'find', 'collection', 'actors', 'are', 'more', 'accomplised', 'role', 'play', 'giving', 'performances', 'respective', 'careers', 'Spacey', 'even', 'better', 'was', ""'The"", 'Usual', 'Suspects', 'Bening', 'different', 'side', 'career', 'woman', 'many', 'movie', 'stereotypes', 'Birch', 'disappointment', 'early', 'adulthood', 'perfectly', 'Bentley', 'so', 'astute', 'almost', 'disconcerting', 'Suvari', 'sublime', 'Venus-image/frightened', 'little', 'girl', 'Add', 'mix', 'dollop', 'brilliant', 'humour', 'have', 'what', 'probably', 'one', 'most', 'important', 'movies', '90', 'quite', 'possibly', 'even', 'century']",Belleza Americana American Beauty  VHS

What makes this piece so interesting though is the myriad of characters  that could be described as 'quirky', they're so much fun to watch.  You  have the average Joe (Spacey), the wife nobody would want (Annette Bening),  the teenage blonde (Mena Suvari) etc.  Everybody is so weird that it's safe  to say that the gay neighbours are the most normal characters in the whole  movie.  This, along with Magnolia, made 1999 a fantastic year for ensemble  pieces.

67787,A1Q0AQ2HVNSYYW,0783239408,Mr. Cairene,"[292, 340]","I read somewhere that the overwelmingly red look of American Beauty is a symbol for blood and roses. Represented in the film by the flower petals in  Lester Burnham's fantasies, and the blood spilt when the sadness that  hovers beneath bears its face. The title of American Beauty does not refer  to the pretty surfaces that hide the anguish of these people, but the  beauty of their souls when dealing with that anguish. Many reviewers have  considered the title to be ironic, it isn't.  I've heard Kevin Spacey say  that this film is about context, because taken out of context the behaviour  of these characters seem bizzare and even phsycotic, but out with in the  context of their messy lives or indeed anybody's life, it seems natural. If  I tell you that Kevin Spacey plays a character who is obsessed with the  idea of sleeping with his daughter's best friend, a daughter who constantly  anounces her hatred of her parents, a woman so obsessed with appearances  that happiness is but a memory to her, a loner who makes his living as a  drug dealer with a firm rigid father living in denial about his son and  himself, you would guess that there would be no one to like in this film.  You would be wrong. This film is magical in the way it lets identify with  these characters, care for them and worry about their outcome.  Infact  the ideas of American Beauty are nothing new. The persuit of happiness  through the abanodoning of materialistic possesions and the satisfaction of  primal, animal and natural desires was the exact same premise for Fight  Club. This could be a middle aged version of that film. The family turmoil  closely resembles Ang Lee's The Ice Storm 1998, and like that film,  American Beauty ends in tragedy. But as with all masterpieces its not the  &quot;point&quot; that counts, but how you get there. Just like the fact  that anything new you learn in life is the history you don't know, most  originality in movies is the movies you haven't seen and the novel's you  haven't read. The fact that the film remains a masterpiece is a credit to  the execution of those ideas, not their originality.  Our hero is Lester  Burnham a man who goes quits his job, black mails his boss, and goes wild  for a year. His journey of self-discovery is not what your average citizen  would call moral, yet we still sympathise. My favourite scene in the film  is where Lester meets Ricky(Wes Bently) outside a part. Ricky sells  marijuana for a living and makes a lot of money. Lester tells him that when  he was his age he &quot;flipped burgers all summer long&quot; for very  little money. &quot;That sucks&quot; says Ricky, &quot;No actually it was  wonderful.&quot; The heart of the film is this scene, Lester's yearning for  those years where his whole life was ahead of him, when he believed he coul  do anything, when he wasn't such a &quot;loser&quot;. This purity is the  Beauty to which the title refers.  Ricky Fitts is the boy next door, a  loner who likes to film people. His father is a rigid military man. Both  Wes Bently and Chris Cooper who play father and son respectively give  monumental performance equal to Kevin Spacey's oscar winner. Their family  is a contrast to Lester's, and in its tragedy, emotional complexity and  heart break exceeds it. Ricky's catatonic mother is perhaps what Lester  would have become had he not taken charge of his life.  I have tried to  define this film, but its not a film that can be defined. It is one to be  experienced. If I tell that the sight of a paper bag blowing in the wind  will amaze you, you find it very silly indeed. Acredit then to this film  that when Ricky show us a video of a paper bag blowing in the wind, it is  indeed a breathtakingly beautiful sight.",5,BLOOD AND ROSES,956361600,"04 22, 2000",2000,3747,"['read', 'somewhere', 'overwelmingly', 'red', 'look', 'American', 'Beauty', 'symbol', 'blood', 'roses', 'Represented', 'film', 'flower', 'petals', 'Lester', 'Burnham', 'fantasies', 'blood', 'spilt', 'when', 'sadness', 'hovers', 'beneath', 'face', 'title', 'American', 'Beauty', 'not', 'refer', 'pretty', 'hide', 'anguish', 'people', 'beauty', 'souls', 'when', 'dealing', 'anguish', 'Many', 'reviewers', 'have', 'considered', 'title', 'be', 'ironic', ""n't"", ""'ve"", 'heard', 'Kevin', 'Spacey', 'say', 'film', 'context', 'taken', 'out', 'context', 'behaviour', 'characters', 'seem', 'bizzare', 'even', 'phsycotic', 'context', 'messy', 'lives', 'indeed', 'anybody', 'life', 'natural', 'tell', 'Kevin', 'Spacey', 'character', 'who', 'obsessed', 'idea', 'sleeping', 'daughter', 'best', 'friend', 'daughter', 'who', 'constantly', 'hatred', 'parents', 'woman', 'so', 'obsessed', 'appearances', 'happiness', 'memory', 'loner', 'who', 'living', 'drug', 'dealer', 'firm', 'father', 'living', 'denial', 'son', 'would', 'guess', 'would', 'be', 'one', 'like', 'film', 'would', 'be', 'wrong', 'film', 'magical', 'way', 'identify', 'characters', 'care', 'worry', 'outcome', 'Infact', 'ideas', 'American', 'Beauty', 'are', 'nothing', 'new', 'persuit', 'happiness', 'abanodoning', 'materialistic', 'possesions', 'satisfaction', 'primal', 'animal', 'natural', 'desires', 'was', 'exact', 'same', 'premise', 'Fight', 'Club', 'could', 'be', 'middle', 'aged', 'version', 'film', 'family', 'turmoil', 'closely', 'Ang', 'Lee', 'Ice', 'Storm', '1998', 'film', 'American', 'Beauty', 'tragedy', 'masterpieces', 'not', 'quot', 'point', 'quot', 'how', 'get', 'there', 'Just', 'fact', 'anything', 'new', 'learn', 'life', 'history', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'most', 'originality', 'movies', 'movies', 'have', ""n't"", 'seen', 'novel', 'have', ""n't"", 'read', 'fact', 'film', 'masterpiece', 'credit', 'execution', 'ideas', 'not', 'originality', 'hero', 'Lester', 'Burnham', 'man', 'who', 'job', 'black', 'boss', 'wild', 'year', 'journey', 'self-discovery', 'not', 'what', 'average', 'citizen', 'would', 'call', 'moral', 'yet', 'still', 'sympathise', 'favourite', 'scene', 'film', 'where', 'Lester', 'Ricky', 'Wes', 'Bently', 'part', 'Ricky', 'marijuana', 'living', 'lot', 'money', 'Lester', 'when', 'was', 'age', 'quot', 'flipped', 'burgers', 'summer', 'long', 'quot', 'very', 'little', 'money', 'quot', 'quot', 'Ricky', 'quot', 'No', 'actually', 'was', 'wonderful.', 'quot', 'heart', 'film', 'scene', 'Lester', 'yearning', 'years', 'where', 'whole', 'life', 'was', 'ahead', 'when', 'believed', 'coul', 'do', 'anything', 'when', 'was', ""n't"", 'such', 'quot', 'quot', 'purity', 'Beauty', 'title', 'refers', 'Ricky', 'Fitts', 'boy', 'next', 'door', 'loner', 'who', 'film', 'people', 'father', 'rigid', 'military', 'man', 'Wes', 'Bently', 'Chris', 'Cooper', 'who', 'play', 'father', 'son', 'respectively', 'give', 'monumental', 'performance', 'equal', 'Kevin', 'Spacey', 'oscar', 'winner', 'family', 'contrast', 'Lester', 'tragedy', 'emotional', 'complexity', 'heart', 'break', 'Ricky', 'catatonic', 'mother', 'perhaps', 'what', 'Lester', 'would', 'have', 'become', 'had', 'not', 'taken', 'charge', 'life', 'have', 'tried', 'define', 'film', 'not', 'film', 'can', 'be', 'defined', 'one', 'be', 'experienced', 'tell', 'sight', 'paper', 'bag', 'blowing', 'wind', 'will', 'amaze', 'find', 'very', 'silly', 'indeed', 'Acredit', 'then', 'film', 'when', 'Ricky', 'show', 'video', 'paper', 'bag', 'blowing', 'wind', 'indeed', 'breathtakingly', 'beautiful', 'sight']",Belleza Americana American Beauty  VHS

His character, while a part of a great ensemble cast, was really , in the end, the driving influence of this unforgettable film.Annette Benning was amazing as well, despite the fact that her character, in the end, was not exactly likeable or sympathetic at all.  She somehow ends the film as a somewhat sympathetic figure, which is attributed directly to Benning's performance.The young actors (Birch and Bentley) are terrific in what amounts to a mature film about some very serious subject matter, they shine.The really underrated performance in this film is that of Chris Cooper as Col. Frank Fitts, yet another example of why he is one of our great, lesser known actors.  Thankfully, since this film, he has gotten his notice, and some meaty roles in other big name films.Lester Burnham will forever go down as one of the most lovable and remembered characters in American film history, and American Beauty will go down as one of the 10 best American films ever made.Deservingly so on both ends.

The filming here is absolutely spellbinding.  You see image after image of the family so eerily apart.  And there is something of this in each person's everyday life.  That's one reason why this film is so darn disturbing.This is not an easy film, and I suspect many viewers gave up on it early, rather than try to meld with it and understand what it's truly about.  And don't expect me to tell you what it's truly about, because I am sure that there's a subjective element here and that film has different messages for different people, if they will open up to receive it.There are touchy issues here, and it is so easy to misunderstand what the movie is saying.  It sure isn't saying that happiness is reverting to the teenage perspective.  Kevin Spacey's character does this, but I don't believe he has really found happiness or satisfaction.  He, and each character here, is seeking in his or her own way to make sense out of the life they are in, and each has moments of frustration.Like so many looks at life, though, this movie presents more questions than answers.  Each somehow messes up, and the question is how could each have done better.  Maybe by melting the separation which is so feelingly portrayed here?Lots of intelligent and well meaning people hate this film.  If you haven't seen it, I would say to see it and form your opinion.

I thought this film would be a great spotlight for him.I was wrong.There isn't a whole lot in this movie that's redeeming.  The premise is that American suburbia has this look of perfectness and that everybody thinks it's some wonderful place.  The thing that makes AB ""edgy"" and ""hip"" is the way that the modern American family is revealed to not be perfect.  In fact, it's shown as a mess.Well, first off if you needed to be told life wasn't perfect you've got bigger problems than liking this steaming pile of crap.Second, if you think that this film is edgy and subversive and thought that's why it was cool, go watch David Cronenberg's Videodrome.  If you can follow it, you'll get an education in a hurry about what thought-provoking cinema should be.I'll cut to the chase.  The characters in this film are awful.  Not one of them does a d---ed thing to help themselves.  I, for one, do not identify with characters who wallow in self pity and never stand up to help themselves.  And no, Kevin Spacey's character does not deal with his problems.  He runs from them.  He retreats into a shell of adolescence instead of being an adult and handling the situation he's in.  Frankly, he's the worst of the lot.  We've got a stereotypical (that's right, in a film that's so high-brow we've got a hopelessly stereotyped character) homophobic All-American type war veteran.  He's played capably, but the character is and should be an affront to people's sensibilities.  This is how veterans are portayed in this film?  What the heck kind of message is that?  No veteran I've ever met acted remotely like this.We've got a cheating housewife, too.  That's great.  You're not adult enough to handle problems in your marriage so you have an affair.  Wonderful.  So far we've got a homophobic, borderline abusive veteran, an irresponsible mother, and we've got the ""I'll escape my problems by ignoring them"" Kevin Spacey.  Great.So we're basically showing how irresponsible Americans are.  This is original?  I can look out my window and see the same point made for free, and it's less snobbishly faux-philosophic.And if you think it's edgy to look at America as a land of irresponsibility and that this wasn't abundantly obvious already, you've got your head in the ground.Instead of dwelling on how bad things are, we should focus on what can be done to fix them.  American Beauty is content to sit and shout ""LOOK!  LOOK AT HOW AMERICA IS DISINTEGRATING!  LOOK!"" and makes no effort to rectify the problem.  The ending is two kids doing what everybody else in this waste of time seems to be doing - running away.  Stand up and do something about your lot, you poor excuses for human beings!  But no, they'd rather run away than deal with reality.And that's what does nothing but infuriate me about this film.I don't understand how anyone can think this is worthwhile or even vaguely interesting.

They said so openly at the Oscars. This is clear,  as well, through the gimmick, copied from Sunset Boulevard, of the dead  protagonist's opening and closing narration. Mendes and Ball aren't fit to  carry Billy Wilder's director's chair.For one thing, Wilder --  considered anything but subtle in his day -- wore silk gloves, in contrast  to the hamhanded doings here. More importantly, as cynical as he often was,  he didn't constantly remind you how superior he (thought he) was to his  characters. Well, at least we know that this picture's creators have  healthy self-esteem.Every character in American Beauty is  one-dimensional, a prop in the filmmakers' anti-morality tale. The latter  apparently have an adolescent notion that people are good, only to the  degree that they do whatever they feel like at any given moment.And yet,  the screenplay does have its funny moments, most of which involve Spacey,  the one character (the gay couple can't be counted: their brief,  superficial presence exists only to emphasize the homophobic colonel's  wickedness) for whom Mendes and Ball feel any sympathy. Much technical  skill is in evidence. And the cast does marvelous work. Kevin Spacey, in  particular, gives a performance for the ages, in this otherwise  conventionally PC, Hollywood concoction.Having spent my entire childhood  in suburbia, I know its problems all too well. But Mendes and Ball don't.  Their movie is jaundiced, without the clear-eyed view typical of Wilder in  his prime. American Beauty is an ignorant, self-righteous exercise in  bigotry. In a just world, suburbanites would be able to make movies mocking  Hollywood hypocrisy, something like, &quot;Hey, I  Spend My Free Time and  Influence Getting Murderers Paroled ...

67804,A1S0TB8S4Y7CIQ,0783239408,Nicholas Stix,"[8, 27]","With the video release of American Beauty, now you, too, can rent or own this subversive satire of the hypocrisy, Nazism, and homophobia lurking among the freshly cut lawns and orderly subdivisions of suburban civilization.In American Beauty, an expert Hollywood eye shows an American neighborhood for what it really is: the miserable businesswoman putting on a phony, cheery face; the degraded husband who, suffering a midlife crisis, fantasizes about his daughter's girlfriend; the girlfriend, who brags of seducing older men; and best of all, the new neighbors, a retired Marine Corps colonel and his family. The homophobic colonel is of course a neo-Nazi and closet homosexual. Meanwhile, the one gay couple on the block is as sweet, decent, and tolerant as everyone else is screwed up, mean-spirited, and phony.Bad enough, that director Sam Mendes and screenwriter/co-producer Alan Ball, presume to be telling ""the truth"" about suburbia, but they think they're doing director-screenwriter-producer Billy Wilder [alive in 2000, at the time of original publication] proud! They said so at the Oscars. This is clear, as well, through the gimmick, copied from Wilder's 1950 masterpiece, Sunset Boulevard, of the dead protagonist's (William Holden's Joe Gillis) opening and closing narration. Mendes and Ball aren't fit to carry Billy Wilder's director's chair. Indeed, today a young Billy Wilder would be satirizing them and their ilk.Billy Wilder has never shown hatred toward the land that not only made him rich, but which saved the Viennese refugee from being turned into soap by his fellow Austrian, Hitler. And in contrast to the retired Marine Corps colonel on whom Mendes and Ball focus their hatred, see Wilder's affectionate portrait of America's fighting men in his Oscar-winning, 1953 movie, Stalag 17.Wilder -- considered anything but subtle in his day -- wore silk gloves, in contrast to the hamhanded doings here. And though cynical, he didn't ooze superiority over his characters. In Sunset Boulevard, for instance, Wilder depicted faded silent screen legend ""Norma Desmond"" (played by Gloria Swanson, herself a faded silent screen giant in a career-capping performance dripping in irony) as a monster, and yet, she was a monster for whom he clearly felt affection. Wilder, as screenwriter, gave Desmond the best line in the picture, which indicted the Hollywood of his time. When a police detective asks Desmond, ""Didn't you used to be big in pictures?,"" she responds, ""I AM big. It's the pictures that got small."" They sure did.Mendes and Ball confuse glibness and smugness with irony, with every character a mere prop in their anti-morality tale. They promote the adolescent notion that people are good, only to the degree that they do whatever they feel like at any given moment.And yet, the picture does have its funny moments, most of which involve Spacey, one of only two characters for whom Mendes and Ball feel any sympathy. The other character is a young, drug-dealing, peeping Tom -- but he's authentic! (The gay couple can't be counted: Their brief, superficial presence exists only to emphasize the evil of the homophobic colonel.) Much technical skill is in evidence. And the cast does marvelous work. Kevin Spacey, in particular, gives a performance for the ages, in this otherwise conventionally PC, Hollywood concoction.American Beauty has two basic attitudes, each of which is anathema to Billy Wilder's work. 1. Political correctness. Wilder made a living skewering the sort of simple-minded notions that Mendes and Ball prize. 2. Authenticity: Younger fans of this film have said things like, ""It'll change your life!"" They saw the film as saying that most people walk around already dead, but don't know it yet. When protagonist Lester Burnham (Spacey) has an awakening, his life can never be the same.But of course! In an Intro to Psychology lecture in 1978, wide-eyed with wonder, I heard about the philosophy that swept across America, after The War. The brainchild of the German philosopher, Martin Heidegger (1889-1977), existentialism teaches the ethics of ""authenticity,"" of consciously living under the shadow of death, without religious evasions or ""bad faith."" Existentialism's impassioned attack on hypocrisy, has always made it attractive to young people. And yet, its premise -- that life is led only in the face of mortality -- is philosophy's point of departure, not its destination.Had Ball and Mendes known anything about existentialism, they would have known that it is inseparable from ... Nazism!Martin Heidegger's philosophy of life was of a piece with his politics. Like other Nazis, he was disgusted by the hypocrisy of bourgeois life.And then there is American Beauty's embrace of homosexuality, and insistence on an unholy trinity of Nazism, homophobia, and closet homosexuality.One of the obscenities of revisionist, pc history is the assertion that the Nazis persecuted homosexuals, just as they did Jews. In fact, the second most powerful man in the Nazi Party, Ernst Roehm, was an open homosexual, as were all of his lieutenant/lovers. Roehm headed the Storm Troopers, who openly brutalized Jews and leftists. Among many Party members, Ernst Roehm was even more popular than the Fuehrer. That's why Hitler, in an infamous ""night of the long knives,"" had Roehm and his lieutenants murdered.It is understandable that gay activists would want to grind the history of Nazi homosexuality, and those who would tell it, under their jackboots. But Billy Wilder knew all about Roehm and Heidegger.Having grown up in suburbia, I know its problems all too well. And as a Jew who lived for five years in West Germany (1980-85), and once got his nose bashed in by an old Nazi, I know something about the problem of authenticity, too. But Mendes and Ball are strangers to such problems, their jaundiced movie a self-righteous exercise in bigotry and ignorance.In a just world, suburbanites would be able to make movies mocking Hollywood hypocrisy, say, ""I Spend My Free Time and Influence Getting Murderers Paroled ... So They Can Kill Again!"" Oops!

67805,A2J9FM9PZNDPNP,0783239408,"""nicktuba""","[1, 4]","I just watched ""American beauty"" on DVD, and I still draw the same conclusions about this film as I did when I first saw it, three years ago. The supreme talent of screenwriter Alan Ball and director Sam Mendes is evident at every turn. Kevin Spacey is perfect in the role of Lester Burnham, as are Annette Bening, Thora Birch, Mena Suvari, Wes Bentley and Chris Cooper in their respective roles. The situations, actions and misunderstandings may seem lightweight and even far-fetched by some standards, but they never seem contrived, and the film offers a distinct look at life within modern American suburbia. The strangest things can happen in the most mundane places, to the most ordinary-looking people, even on a street that you might find anywhere in America.That the film remains dramatic and yet humorous is one of its strengths. The characters may be angry and miserable, but seeing them get the better of each other, their bosses, and others gives the film a satiric quality. But the message is more important than mere satire. Only after you consider the characters, their actions, how they wrestle deep-held apathy and begin to piece together some sort of meaning, do you begin to understand the full consequence of the film's tagline, ""Look closer"".""American Beauty"" is difficult to classify into one genre because it encompasses so many. There's mystery, dark comedy, film noir, and even romance, all set within a cynical, but heartfelt, story. You will also notice the plethora of similarities between this movie and Alan Ball's TV series ""Six Feet Under,"" including Thora Birch's character, the mothers played by Bening and Allison Janney, the Thomas Newman score, and the general mood. If anything, ""American Beauty"" seems like a prequel, or a companion piece, to the HBO series.The DVD itself offers a behind-the-scenes ""making of"" featurette which is too short and, frankly, one of the most unexciting I've seen. I would have preferred to see more interviews of the cast members and the production team, talking about their experiences of making the film. However, this minor drawback does not detract from the overall worth of the DVD; the film's presentation is excellent and on the same level as other, similar disks for movies released in 1999.Like other Oscar-winning films, you might watch this one and wonder, why don't they make more movies like this. ""American Beauty"" is an American classic, with equal moments of delight and tragedy. It evokes thoughtfulness, because it forces you to question your definition of beauty, and what you consider beautiful in life. Beauty, and the interpretation of it, is of key importance in nearly every scene. Watch especially for the reaction of a teenage boy, toward the end of the film, as he directly witnesses the result of a bizarre and gruesome murder.

So many films try to forget that we are all the 'hero' and the 'villian' in our own life story.  Our perception of mean and hateful people are just as easily perceived as kind and joyful by other people in other situations.  What we lack in our mundane everyday lives is the ability to understand and perceive the emotions and motives of other people.

He broke out of his mundane world and started speeding toward all his hopes and dreams accomplishing so much along the way.  At last when he understands what happiness really means to him....is when he truly achieved it.

It states what the beauty is that we think about, through the characters in the film. Lester who works sincerely in his place of work for a long time, his wife Carolyn who is a realtor and his daughter Jane who is a cheerleader in high school, they look all quite normal and ordinary outwardly. It is an appearance of the middle class citizen in America who has a nice car and house. However, it is only an outward figure. Lester is in constant fear when he would get fired by his firm, Carolyn feels embarrassed not to sell the house for several months and Jane is fed up with her boring life.One day a family, which moves into the next their house, is similarly circumstanced. Frank who is a colonel in the U.S. Marine Corps, collects the Nazi-shape carved plates and guns as his hobby, and always keeps watch on his son excessively. His son, Ricky always conducts odd things such as taking a photograph a dead bird or the next house in secret or a vinyl bag, which is blowing in the wind. In addition, he sells marihuana even smokes together with Lester. Ricky&iexcl;s mom, Barbara is also abnormal.Like this the characters in this film have some problems unlike their outward appearance. They appear to be peaceful externally, but internally they do not know that they are holding a bomb, which can explode sooner or later. After all, this bomb&iexcl;s wick begins to be caught on fire as Jane&iexcl;s friend, Angela shows up. In the end, this bomb destroys two families completely at the last part of this film. Since Lester becomes to be attracted by Angela, this family that will blow up some day, collapses and his dangerous relationship with his wife and daughter is shattered.As far as I can see, this film seems to express that the beauty just cannot be called and judged as its exposed outward aspect. The things that Ricky films, especially, the shape of vinyl, which waves in the wind at the fallen leaves street, it seems to imply that hidden meaning. The implications about the beauty that people do not think, feel and see as conventional wisdoms, the director express it from this film. This film begins with Lester&iexcl;s narration and ends with his death. A remarkably frank script, outstanding direction and brilliant performances, on the whole, it is a well-matched film.",5,What the beauty is....,1041984000,"01 8, 2003",2003,2377,"['film', 'talking', 'iexcl', 'beauty', 'iexcl', 'can', 'know', 'title', 'what', 'beauty', 'think', 'characters', 'film', 'Lester', 'who', 'sincerely', 'place', 'work', 'long', 'time', 'wife', 'Carolyn', 'who', 'realtor', 'daughter', 'Jane', 'who', 'cheerleader', 'high', 'school', 'look', 'quite', 'normal', 'ordinary', 'outwardly', 'appearance', 'middle', 'class', 'citizen', 'America', 'who', 'nice', 'car', 'house', 'However', 'only', 'outward', 'figure', 'Lester', 'constant', 'fear', 'when', 'would', 'get', 'fired', 'firm', 'Carolyn', 'feels', 'embarrassed', 'not', 'sell', 'house', 'several', 'months', 'Jane', 'fed', 'up', 'boring', 'life.One', 'day', 'family', 'next', 'house', 'similarly', 'circumstanced', 'Frank', 'who', 'colonel', 'U.S.', 'Marine', 'Corps', 'Nazi-shape', 'carved', 'plates', 'guns', 'hobby', 'always', 'keeps', 'watch', 'son', 'excessively', 'son', 'Ricky', 'always', 'odd', 'things', 'such', 'taking', 'photograph', 'dead', 'bird', 'next', 'house', 'secret', 'vinyl', 'bag', 'blowing', 'wind', 'addition', 'marihuana', 'even', 'together', 'Lester', 'Ricky', 'iexcl', 'mom', 'Barbara', 'also', 'abnormal.Like', 'characters', 'film', 'have', 'problems', 'outward', 'appearance', 'appear', 'be', 'peaceful', 'externally', 'internally', 'do', 'not', 'know', 'are', 'holding', 'bomb', 'can', 'explode', 'sooner', 'later', 'bomb', 'iexcl', 'wick', 'begins', 'be', 'caught', 'fire', 'Jane', 'iexcl', 'friend', 'Angela', 'up', 'end', 'bomb', 'two', 'families', 'completely', 'last', 'part', 'film', 'Lester', 'be', 'attracted', 'Angela', 'family', 'will', 'blow', 'up', 'day', 'collapses', 'dangerous', 'relationship', 'wife', 'daughter', 'shattered.As', 'far', 'can', 'see', 'film', 'express', 'beauty', 'just', 'can', 'not', 'be', 'called', 'judged', 'exposed', 'outward', 'aspect', 'things', 'Ricky', 'films', 'especially', 'shape', 'vinyl', 'wind', 'fallen', 'street', 'imply', 'hidden', 'meaning', 'implications', 'beauty', 'people', 'do', 'not', 'think', 'feel', 'see', 'conventional', 'wisdoms', 'director', 'express', 'film', 'film', 'Lester', 'iexcl', 'narration', 'death', 'remarkably', 'frank', 'script', 'outstanding', 'direction', 'brilliant', 'performances', 'whole', 'well-matched', 'film']",Belleza Americana American Beauty  VHS
67808,A1M9DQDGE07Q0U,0783239408,Nix Pix,"[1, 2]","""American Beauty"" is the story of Lester Burnham (Kevin Spacey), a man unhappy in his home life, unsettled with the prospect of growing old and disenchanted with his career. Neither his wife, Carolyn (Annette Benning) nor his daughter, Jane (Thora Birch) respect him and his neighbors don't even know who he is. In short, Lester is a man swimming on the rim of a mid-life crisis. But the tide begins to turn in his favor when Lester decides to throw caution to the wind, blackmail his bosses and collect a hefty buy out settlement.  Of course, Lester's new found independence does not sit well with Carolyn, who prides herself on being in charge of everyone's lives. To relieve her angst, she takes up with rival real estate agent, Buddy Kane (Peter Gallagher) while Jane attempts a misguided elopement with her strange boyfriend, Ricky Fitts (Wes Bentley). Of course all this upset leaves Lester free and clear to pursue a relationship with the high school trollop and Jane's best friend, Angela (Mena Suvari). What is so incredibly compelling about Sam Mendes' masterpiece of reflection, is not so much the way all these lives intersect on a crossroads ultimately doomed to destruction, but how ably the director has managed to capture a slice of the decline and fall of America's constitutional motto of ""life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness.""The DVD transfer does a fine job of capturing the stylized color scheme. Colors are rich, bold and nicely balanced. Contrast levels are bang on. Blacks are deep and solid. There is a hint of pixelization that is more obvious during the darker scenes, but it does not distract from your viewing enjoyment. Fine detail is fully realized. Occasionally there is a hint of edge enhancement but again, it is not terribly obtrusive. The audio is 5.1 and delivers a very deep, rich bass, particularly in the music tracks.

67811,A341BG8RMH8QW,0783239408,NotATameLion,"[3, 4]","American Beauty is truly a fine movie. In vision, insight and execution--few movies can compare with it. Visually stunning, and with an exceptional cast, there is little wonder that it received both critical acclaim and a wide audience. Yet to my mind, this movie is a showcase from the first to the last for the wonderful talent of Kevin Spacey--possibly the greatest actor of our time.Spacey plays the doomed protagonist/anti-hero: Lester Burnham. Check that--Spacey BECOMES Burnham.In this film, more than any of his others, the impact of Spacey's friendship with the great Jack Lemmon is very palpably felt. Not only are there echoes of Lemmon in Spacey's portrayal of Burnham, but one might argue that Spacey's courage in taking on the role of Lester was inspired by Lemmon's own courage in role selection.Spacey's transformation from the beginning to the end of this movie is nothing short of remarkable. Lester becomes a person reborn...spiritually and physically.The supporting cast is also exceptional. Bening, Birch, Bentley and especially Cooper contribute performances that may well prove to be the greatest of their careers. Cooper in particular is chilling, and almost unrecognizable, in a role unlike any other that he has ever played.All that said, what I admire most about American Beauty is its timely message. We live in a world of intense business and illusion. How tempting it is to forget that all of life, no matter how painful or mundane, is a gift. This is the lesson that Lester finally learns. If we stop to look deeper, beyond mere appearances (like Ricky and, ultimately, Lester), Beauty is there to greet us.",3,the final days of Lester Burnham,1031097600,"09 4, 2002",2002,1638,"['American', 'Beauty', 'truly', 'fine', 'movie', 'vision', 'insight', 'execution', 'few', 'movies', 'can', 'compare', 'Visually', 'stunning', 'exceptional', 'cast', 'little', 'wonder', 'received', 'critical', 'acclaim', 'wide', 'audience', 'mind', 'movie', 'showcase', 'first', 'last', 'wonderful', 'talent', 'Kevin', 'Spacey', 'possibly', 'greatest', 'actor', 'time.Spacey', 'doomed', 'protagonist/anti-hero', 'Lester', 'Burnham', 'Check', 'Spacey', 'BECOMES', 'Burnham.In', 'film', 'more', 'others', 'impact', 'Spacey', 'friendship', 'great', 'Jack', 'Lemmon', 'very', 'palpably', 'felt', 'Not', 'only', 'are', 'there', 'echoes', 'Lemmon', 'Spacey', 'portrayal', 'Burnham', 'one', 'might', 'argue', 'Spacey', 'courage', 'taking', 'role', 'Lester', 'was', 'inspired', 'Lemmon', 'own', 'courage', 'role', 'selection.Spacey', 'transformation', 'beginning', 'end', 'movie', 'nothing', 'short', 'remarkable', 'Lester', 'person', 'reborn', 'spiritually', 'physically.The', 'supporting', 'cast', 'also', 'exceptional', 'Bening', 'Birch', 'Bentley', 'especially', 'Cooper', 'contribute', 'performances', 'may', 'well', 'prove', 'be', 'greatest', 'careers', 'Cooper', 'particular', 'chilling', 'almost', 'unrecognizable', 'role', 'other', 'ever', 'played.All', 'said', 'what', 'admire', 'most', 'American', 'Beauty', 'timely', 'message', 'live', 'world', 'intense', 'business', 'illusion', 'How', 'tempting', 'forget', 'life', 'matter', 'how', 'painful', 'mundane', 'gift', 'lesson', 'Lester', 'finally', 'stop', 'look', 'deeper', 'mere', 'appearances', 'Ricky', 'ultimately', 'Lester', 'Beauty', 'there', 'greet']",Belleza Americana American Beauty  VHS

A perrineal portrayal of everyday people, living everyday lives, doin very everyday types of things that we probably don't like to notice ourselves doing.

Then we think, &quot;Doesn't beauty rest in image,&quot; and this movie tries to say, &quot;Not the way we think it does.&quot; The wife in this movie makes this painfully clear in the beginning with her matching apron and ratchet: a nice little thing, but hardly beautiful. As the strange adolescent guy next door illustrates, beauty is essentially something inside of ourselves. He illustrates this clearly when he is watching one of his videos, and besides just liking what he sees, he speaks in a stream of consciousness and reflection. Clearly, there is more than meets the eye in real art.This symbolism described is repeated throughout the movie, and little of it is terribly new: a handsome, charming, and succesful man; rebellion by doing something unattractive; or simply deviating from routine.

67815,A1AST89AHN17O7,0783239408,Omnes,"[1, 2]","If I had to name one american movie that is an example of great cinema done during the nineties, one movie that manages to stand out from the lot, both artistically and thematically, and which deserves all its awards, it should be American Beauty.Why?First of all because Alan Ball, who became more respected with this movie, with Six Feet Under and True Blood, forces us to take a closer look to what we take for granted, to see how one family, the Burnhams, really looks like inside its house, behind its curtains and perfect roses, how the wonderful suburban dream is one big lie. Just like Desperate Housewives, which was heavily influenced by this movie, Lester Burnham, who died under strange circumstances, make us witness how his family's interactions with new friends and neighbors make them do things they never did before, things that bring forth a tragedy.Secondly, Sam Mendes, with his gorgeous directing, show us the Burnhams lives in a very touching and comic fashion. He creates a dramedy so powerful that even its most funniest scenes, especially in the Burnham dining room, are also the most dramatic. This mix of comedy and drama may not please everyone, will shock and outrage some people, but it adds layers to this drama, which is also a powerful satire on the american dream. Not only that, Sam Mendes gives a more interesting ending. Instead of following the original script, which had trial scenes, tv news, and a big epilogue with a ghostly Lester Burnham flying over his neighborhood, Mendes ends ""American Beauty"" on a cliffhanger and encourages us to think of what we watched, to wonder how a family and a neighborhood will live on after what happened to one of them.Thirdly, Thomas Newman's soundtrack gives a mysterious and eerie atmosphere to the lives of the Burnhams. Scenes that would seem banal under the hands of a different composer, and director, become touching and incredibly moving, especially one involving a plastic bag floating under the wind.Finally, all the actors give wonderful interpretations to their characters, performances that stay in the viewer's memories. All the actors manage to turn their characters into real people, people who we may try to defend their actions, even when they are not the most honorable.In the end, it is such a powerful movie that everyone, whether they like it or not, should see once in their life.

The director, Sam Mendes, comes straight from Broadway, and you can tell. The movie feels like a play. It starts out with Spacey  narrating, giving us a tour of his town &aacute; la &quot;Our Town&quot;. The  direction has its good and bad points. The acting is terrific, but the  movie feels claustrophobic. Perhaps you are supposed to feel trapped on  that stage of suburbia, but that conflicts with some of the aerial  cinematography that would suggest otherwise.

The hustle to get the newest things, have the biggest house, be the most popular and to basically have everything you envy, is at the base of this academy award winning film. This movie makes you do exactly what the advertisements say which is to LOOK CLOSER...This movie opens your eyes to the seemingly normal families living in the suburbs of America. This movie tells the story of the Burnham's, Lester(played masterfully in an academy award winning role by Kevin Spacey) the family Patriarch who is in love with his high school daughter's best friend, Carolyn Burnham(in a stellar performance that was academy award nominated, by Annette Benning), who is a real estate agent, with aspirations to be as big as the supposed ""KING"" of real estate. The Daughter of this couple is played very well by Thora Birch. The acting in this movie will leave you dumbfounded saying ""how can someone act like that"".This movie is an instant classic with inventive supporting characters, Ricky the marijuana selling, videotaping neighbor. He videotapes everything he can and seemingly has explanations for all of it. The psychotic, image obsessed friend of the Burnham's Daughter(played by Mena Suvari) who says she would consider having an affair with Lester.The bottom line is that this movie is probably one of the best movies in recent memory. It will leave you wanting for more and you will want to watch it again and again.  Sam Mendes in his directorial debut could not have done a better job with this film. The cinematography, writing, backgrounds and the little objects and the character's nuances are dead on.

This has to be one of the cleverest movies for quite some time. I loved it the first time I had watched it and every time I watch it it gets more and more interesting. It could be a timeless classic. And the fact that it is so origional is a plus...Lester Burnam is in his 40s and has given up on life completely. He knows his wife and daughter hate him, and his job is threatened. His wife is a real estate sales woman, and one night, Lester and Carolyn attend a sort of, reception. And there, Carolyn becomes attrawcted to her competition, and Lester sneaks out and ""parties"" with his teenage neighbor Ricky Fittz, who has been video-taping his daughter. So Lester and Ricky become friends as Lester occasionlay checks up to get more drugs from him. And one night, at a baskeball game, Lester meets Janes best friend, Anglea, who he then finds a purpose to exist in, and she spends the night and Lester is hooked at he has wild fantasies abou ther and rose petals. So the story leads up to the conclusion where Ricky's dad, who is an ex marine core man, spys on his son and BELIEVES he is giving Lester a blow job and he wont let his son turn into a homosexual ( cleaning up the language a bit ) and tells him to get out. Mean while, Lester finds his wife chesting on him with Buddy and he doesn't really care, their marriage is for show, to show how perfect they really are, when they are any thing but, and Anglea and Jane have a fight because Angela wants to sleep with Lester, and he gets just that, almost, but, Anglea tells him that she is a virgin, and so the story goes....The end, when Lester is talking about his life, that actually brought me to tears ( I swear to you ) and I thought it was so moving. I look back now and I still think it is extremely well written and filmed. My dad said that this resembles MARRIED WITH CHILDREN, except with no comedy. This has to be one of the top movies of the decade.

67822,A2QDD6OWIAEBED,0783239408,"Paul Aragon ""krakatoa1883""","[4, 13]","American Beauty though visually appealing, well acted, and quite entertaining in many places, is still a very troubling film experiance to suffer through. It is a film that tries to pass itself off as a realistic piece, but is in actually hypothetical to a fault. It is as if the writer, Alan Ball, decided to pull a bunch of ""What ifs"" from his hat. What if there was a high level administative type guy entering his midlife cricis, so he dicides to say ""Bite Me!"" to the man, quits his high pressure job in favor of a fun fast food environment, starts smoking a lot of pot, buys the muscle car of his dreams, then begins getting buffed out in an attempt to have sex with his daughters hot young cheerleader friend? What if this mans wife thinks that her husband is an inadequate closet case that deserves little more then contempt, so she undermines the realationship and has an affair with the number one realter in her city? ( played by Peter Gallagher who has made a carrer out of playing the adulterous other man) What if the new next door neighbor to this same man happens to be a starched militant drill sergeant who is in actuality a repressed homophobic homosexual with an unwholesome tendancy to fly off the handle in violent outbursts of uncontrollable rage? It can be argued that these "" What ifs"" I speak of are merely the results of good fiction writing, but that excuse does not explain the rather questionable behavior of the characters in this farce. To better explain my point let me now ask you, the reader, a little hypothetical question of my own.Lets say for the sake of arguement, that you were over a close friends house chatting in the upstairs bedroom, as their father sat downstairs by himself in a darkened kitchen. All of a sudden you hear the unmistakable explosive sound of a large caliber hand gun echoing through the house from the very location of the said father. So now your friend and you in sure panic hustle down the stair case with your hearts pounding in your throats anticipating God knows what, only to find your worst fears realized. Your friends father is hunched over a blood and gore coated table, deader then a doornail with a sizable seeping hole in his head, and an eerie smirk frozen on his dead face. What would you do?A) Would you flip out and go hysterical and possibly run down the walk way screaming blue murder like the poor maid who discovered the butchered bodies at the Sharon Tates house?B) Or would you study the dead body like an exhibit at the Smithsonian, and smile back at the smirking corpse while your friend does nothing but act all nonchalant about their freshly murdered father?Unfortunately the fine people who brought you American Beauty did not answer A, they figured that B, was a suitable ending for this fine story. Believe you me, the sigh of dissapointment I let out in the theatre was heard 10 rows back. To make matters even more dire, they also chose to have the murderer be the militant homophobe next door, talk about problematic representation of sexuality, according to these guys, homosexuality might as well be a mental illness that brings with it the confused desire to kill any straight person who snubs their passes, YIKES!! My second sigh of grief was fallowed by a rather lenthy profane grumble of disgust. As a result I have only seen this film two times, once in 1999 at the theatre, the second time about four months back in an attempt to give this film a second chance. The result is obvious, the same sence of betrayal I felt still prevaded any enjoyment that the situations may have provided me in this film, overall the film was killed by its hypothetical cliche's.P.S. as a side note, I think that Meg Griffen from the Family Guy played the role of Kevin Spacy's daughter in this film, but don't hold me to it.",3,Don't believe the hype-othetical!,1150588800,"06 18, 2006",2006,3812,"['American', 'Beauty', 'visually', 'appealing', 'well', 'acted', 'quite', 'entertaining', 'many', 'places', 'still', 'very', 'troubling', 'film', 'experiance', 'suffer', 'film', 'pass', 'off', 'realistic', 'piece', 'actually', 'hypothetical', 'fault', 'writer', 'Alan', 'Ball', 'decided', 'pull', 'bunch', 'What', 'ifs', 'hat', 'What', 'was', 'high', 'level', 'administative', 'type', 'guy', 'entering', 'midlife', 'cricis', 'say', 'Bite', 'Me', 'man', 'high', 'pressure', 'job', 'favor', 'fun', 'fast', 'food', 'environment', 'smoking', 'lot', 'pot', 'muscle', 'car', 'dreams', 'then', 'getting', 'buffed', 'out', 'attempt', 'have', 'sex', 'daughters', 'hot', 'young', 'cheerleader', 'friend', 'What', 'wife', 'thinks', 'husband', 'inadequate', 'closet', 'case', 'little', 'more', 'then', 'contempt', 'realationship', 'affair', 'number', 'one', 'realter', 'city', 'played', 'Peter', 'Gallagher', 'who', 'made', 'carrer', 'playing', 'adulterous', 'other', 'man', 'What', 'new', 'next', 'door', 'neighbor', 'same', 'man', 'be', 'starched', 'militant', 'drill', 'sergeant', 'who', 'actuality', 'repressed', 'homophobic', 'homosexual', 'unwholesome', 'tendancy', 'fly', 'off', 'handle', 'violent', 'outbursts', 'uncontrollable', 'rage', 'can', 'be', 'argued', 'What', 'ifs', 'speak', 'are', 'merely', 'results', 'good', 'fiction', 'writing', 'excuse', 'not', 'explain', 'rather', 'questionable', 'behavior', 'characters', 'farce', 'better', 'explain', 'point', 'let', 'now', 'ask', 'reader', 'little', 'hypothetical', 'question', 'own.Lets', 'say', 'sake', 'arguement', 'were', 'close', 'friends', 'house', 'chatting', 'upstairs', 'bedroom', 'father', 'sat', 'downstairs', 'darkened', 'kitchen', 'sudden', 'hear', 'unmistakable', 'explosive', 'sound', 'large', 'caliber', 'hand', 'gun', 'echoing', 'house', 'very', 'location', 'said', 'father', 'So', 'now', 'friend', 'sure', 'panic', 'hustle', 'down', 'stair', 'case', 'hearts', 'pounding', 'throats', 'anticipating', 'God', 'what', 'only', 'find', 'worst', 'fears', 'realized', 'friends', 'father', 'hunched', 'blood', 'gore', 'coated', 'table', 'deader', 'then', 'doornail', 'sizable', 'seeping', 'hole', 'head', 'eerie', 'smirk', 'frozen', 'dead', 'face', 'What', 'would', 'do', 'Would', 'flip', 'out', 'go', 'hysterical', 'possibly', 'run', 'down', 'walk', 'way', 'screaming', 'blue', 'murder', 'poor', 'maid', 'who', 'discovered', 'butchered', 'bodies', 'Sharon', 'Tates', 'house', 'B', 'Or', 'would', 'study', 'dead', 'body', 'exhibit', 'Smithsonian', 'smile', 'back', 'smirking', 'corpse', 'friend', 'nothing', 'act', 'nonchalant', 'freshly', 'murdered', 'father', 'Unfortunately', 'fine', 'people', 'who', 'brought', 'American', 'Beauty', 'did', 'not', 'answer', 'A', 'figured', 'B', 'was', 'suitable', 'ending', 'fine', 'story', 'Believe', 'sigh', 'dissapointment', 'let', 'out', 'theatre', 'was', 'heard', '10', 'rows', 'back', 'make', 'matters', 'even', 'more', 'dire', 'also', 'chose', 'have', 'murderer', 'be', 'militant', 'homophobe', 'next', 'door', 'talk', 'problematic', 'representation', 'sexuality', 'according', 'guys', 'homosexuality', 'might', 'as', 'well', 'be', 'mental', 'illness', 'confused', 'desire', 'kill', 'straight', 'person', 'who', 'snubs', 'passes', 'YIKES', 'second', 'sigh', 'grief', 'was', 'fallowed', 'rather', 'lenthy', 'profane', 'grumble', 'disgust', 'result', 'have', 'only', 'seen', 'film', 'two', 'times', 'once', '1999', 'theatre', 'second', 'time', 'four', 'months', 'back', 'attempt', 'give', 'film', 'second', 'chance', 'result', 'obvious', 'same', 'sence', 'betrayal', 'felt', 'still', 'prevaded', 'enjoyment', 'situations', 'may', 'have', 'provided', 'film', 'film', 'was', 'killed', 'hypothetical', ""cliche's.P.S"", 'side', 'note', 'think', 'Meg', 'Griffen', 'Family', 'Guy', 'played', 'role', 'Kevin', 'Spacy', 'daughter', 'film', 'do', ""n't"", 'hold']",Belleza Americana American Beauty  VHS

67824,AWFPO0SDMD4QR,0783239408,Paul,"[9, 13]","Although American Beauty is a terrific film, I am giving this DVD 3 stars because of annoying technical problems and the overall feeling that this disc was put together rushed and incomplete.  These problems were confirmed on 3 different DVD players.  I know this isn't a &quot;special edition&quot;, but still, there could have been more to this release.  The graphics work on the box and the disc itself is simple, nothing to get excited over.  There is no booklet included, just a simple pamphlet with an introduction by the director.  As for the film itself, I think it's wonderful, with excellent characters portrayed by great actors.  OK, so, when I popped the DVD into my player, I was greeted by a screen asking me to pick the audio I prefer.  Where is the MAIN menu?  Where is the choice for 2 channel Dolby?  Anyway, I chose 5.1 channel.  It then went through the Dreamworks logo and THEN it went to the main menu.  Huh?  The main menu now gave you the choice of 2 channel Dolby.  I was confused.  Was this a problem with the disc?  Did the producers want it this way?  Personally, when I put a DVD in my player, I want to be greeted by the MAIN menu.  OK, enough of that.  As for the picture quality, the widescreen image is excellent.  Colors are vibrant throughout the film, and the excellent cinematography is beautiful to watch.  However, I noticed during the first 8 minutes of the film, that the extreme left side of the frame was dirty.  Black spots were noticeable during this period.  This is probably not due to the DVD transfer, but it is a problem with the films negative.  (Am I being too technical?)  If this WAS a problem during the DVD transfer, I hope this will be fixed.  The sound was quite pleasing.  The music and dialogue were recorded beautifully.  The DVD is not an amazing sound experience to test your home system with, but overall, the sound is pristine with beautiful atmosphere and crisp. clean dialogue.  The musical score sounded amazing.  The supplemental material is less then thrilling.  It includes 2 trailers, audio commentary by the dirrector and writer, cast and crew info and production notes.  The DVD has audio commentary during a storyboard sequence by the director and cinematographer.  This storyboard sequence was disappointing because it was a bunch of static pictures with voice-overs, not a video sequence.  It got boring rather quickly.  The DVD does have some behind the scenes footage and interviews in a segment called &quot;American Beauty, A Closer Look.&quot; (not much behind the scenes footage, but some...I would liked to have seen more.) The DVD also contains CD-ROM material for your PC.  In conclusion, I would recommend this DVD only if you enjoyed the film in the theater, or if you've seen it and want to rent it.  If you are looking for a DVD packed with tons of extras, I'd wait for a &quot;special edition&quot; of this film, hopefully containing tons of extras like deleted scenes, more behind the scenes footage, voice-overs by cast members, interviews, etc.  The film itself is wonderful, but this DVD is rather &quot;ordinary.&quot;",3,American Beauty-A rather &quot;ordinary&quot; DVD.,973123200,"11 2, 2000",2000,3114,"['American', 'Beauty', 'terrific', 'film', 'am', 'giving', 'DVD', '3', 'stars', 'annoying', 'technical', 'problems', 'overall', 'feeling', 'disc', 'was', 'put', 'together', 'rushed', 'incomplete', 'problems', 'were', 'confirmed', '3', 'different', 'DVD', 'players', 'know', ""n't"", 'quot', 'special', 'edition', 'quot', 'still', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'more', 'release', 'graphics', 'work', 'box', 'disc', 'simple', 'nothing', 'get', 'excited', 'booklet', 'included', 'just', 'simple', 'pamphlet', 'introduction', 'director', 'film', 'think', 'wonderful', 'excellent', 'characters', 'portrayed', 'great', 'actors', 'OK', 'so', 'when', 'popped', 'DVD', 'player', 'was', 'greeted', 'screen', 'asking', 'pick', 'audio', 'prefer', 'Where', 'MAIN', 'menu', 'Where', 'choice', '2', 'channel', 'Dolby', 'Anyway', 'chose', '5.1', 'channel', 'then', 'went', 'Dreamworks', 'logo', 'THEN', 'went', 'main', 'menu', 'Huh', 'main', 'menu', 'now', 'gave', 'choice', '2', 'channel', 'Dolby', 'was', 'confused', 'Was', 'problem', 'disc', 'producers', 'want', 'way', 'Personally', 'when', 'put', 'DVD', 'player', 'want', 'be', 'greeted', 'MAIN', 'menu', 'OK', 'enough', 'picture', 'quality', 'widescreen', 'image', 'excellent', 'Colors', 'are', 'vibrant', 'film', 'excellent', 'cinematography', 'beautiful', 'watch', 'However', 'noticed', 'first', '8', 'minutes', 'film', 'extreme', 'left', 'side', 'frame', 'was', 'dirty', 'Black', 'spots', 'were', 'noticeable', 'period', 'probably', 'not', 'due', 'DVD', 'transfer', 'problem', 'films', 'negative', 'Am', 'being', 'too', 'technical', 'problem', 'DVD', 'transfer', 'hope', 'will', 'be', 'fixed', 'sound', 'was', 'quite', 'pleasing', 'music', 'dialogue', 'were', 'recorded', 'beautifully', 'DVD', 'not', 'amazing', 'sound', 'experience', 'test', 'home', 'system', 'overall', 'sound', 'pristine', 'beautiful', 'atmosphere', 'crisp', 'clean', 'dialogue', 'musical', 'score', 'sounded', 'amazing', 'supplemental', 'material', 'less', 'then', 'thrilling', '2', 'trailers', 'audio', 'commentary', 'dirrector', 'writer', 'cast', 'crew', 'info', 'production', 'notes', 'DVD', 'audio', 'commentary', 'storyboard', 'sequence', 'director', 'cinematographer', 'storyboard', 'sequence', 'was', 'disappointing', 'was', 'bunch', 'static', 'pictures', 'voice-overs', 'not', 'video', 'sequence', 'got', 'boring', 'rather', 'quickly', 'DVD', 'have', 'scenes', 'footage', 'interviews', 'segment', 'called', 'quot', 'American', 'Beauty', 'A', 'Closer', 'Look.', 'quot', 'not', 'much', 'scenes', 'footage', 'would', 'liked', 'have', 'seen', 'more', 'DVD', 'also', 'CD-ROM', 'material', 'PC', 'conclusion', 'would', 'recommend', 'DVD', 'only', 'enjoyed', 'film', 'theater', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'want', 'rent', 'are', 'looking', 'DVD', 'packed', 'tons', 'extras', ""'d"", 'wait', 'quot', 'special', 'edition', 'quot', 'film', 'hopefully', 'containing', 'tons', 'extras', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'more', 'scenes', 'footage', 'voice-overs', 'cast', 'members', 'interviews', 'etc', 'film', 'wonderful', 'DVD', 'rather', 'quot', 'quot']",Belleza Americana American Beauty  VHS
67825,A1MC81HLJ6Z9ZQ,0783239408,Paul McGrath,"[38, 48]","This was going to be yet another in a long, dull line of Hollywood diatribes against the stultifying, boring and banal existence of suburbia as they perceive it.  It starts off that way.  Kevin Spacey is 14 years  into a job he loathes, he can't communicate with his wife or daughter, and  everything in his life is dull.  His wife, real-estate agent Annette  Bening, is obsessed by success.  She begins her day by repeating some stock  motivational phrase:  ""I will sell this house today;  I will sell this  house today.""  She ends her day by almost breaking down when she doesn't.  Their daughter is an uncommunicative selfish brat, who hates them both.  This story is so hackneyed and these characters are so insipid that the  first part of the movie plays as a dark comic romp.But then Kevin  Spacey perceives beauty.  It is in the form of his daughter's cheerleader  friend, a blond-haired teenaged nymphet.  He is obsessed with her, lusts  for her, dreams for her.  Her beauty, this beauty, changes him.  He begins  to dismantle the life which he has lethargically allowed to be constructed  around him.  ""When was the last time you felt joy?"" he desperately asks his  wife.""You're going to spill beer on the sofa,"" she replies.In the  meantime, their daughter has become infatuated with the next door  neighbor's kid, who himself is fascinated by videotape.  He shows her one  of his favorites.  It is nothing more that a piece of trash, a plastic bag,  blowing around in the wind.  But he perceives beauty in this;  an order;  a sense of calmness;  a benevolent force.  In fact, he sees beauty in  everything.  It sometimes overwhelms him.Kevin Spacey finally realizes  this too, in the last moments of his life.  That there is beauty around us  in every single day of our lives.

I cannot understand why this  picture was considered a masterpiece. It is well crafted, but into what  category does it fall? It's not a whodunit, its  definitely not a comedy ,although there are comic bits scattered  through it. I would put it in the black  melodrama category myself, though  a Shakespearean  type of tragedy might  be a more appropriate description. Supposedly it is a satire on suburban middle class life, with all the usual clich&eacute;s about  material well-being not bringing happiness, and as portrayed in the film it seems to bring about the opposite results.  Imagine, indeed, if you were a rural Ethiopian, for example, watching this movie, you would be totally confused, you would wonder that with all the portrayed wealth and opportunities how  can  the characters be so fatally unhappy? The characters  portrayed have extremely ugly personalities, with the exception of the two male homosexuals in the community (three if you count the man next door who won't admit his homophilia),  but who only have a reflecting role in the film anyway. Admittedly the acting is superb, though I preferred Kevin Spacey in his role in the much superior and sensitive ""Shipping News"" movie.Essentially, ""American Beauty"" shows a married  couple in the prime of their  lives who have convinced themselves that they are losers. What makes the  film worth watching  is how the main characters  react in different ways  to their assumed situation.  Indeed,  most of the  grown up people in the movie appear to be  psychopaths. Naturally, the children  of these psychos are mixed up in various degrees as well.

It is a film to the same people capable of understanding films like ""Blade Runner"", La Dolce Vita, Saving Private Ryan, Forrest Gump and others masterpieces.It is a film to people capable of discerning between something good and bad, people that read truly good books and listen to truly good music. ""It is not to people that like films with Chuck Norris, Jennifer Lopez, and Madonna, and consider both Sylvester Stallone and Madonna respectively the best actor and actress ever"".When I saw this film for the very first time I recognized immediately his value, it is a portrait of a complete alienation of the modern life where the next step is just stay acting all the time as if the life was a ""B film"" with a very poor script indeed, and the worst thing is that you look at your side and see that everybody has been acting the same ""B film"" with the same poor script.What happens in this case is that the character of Kevin Spacey discovers one day this reality and tries to recover the meaning of his life, but he knows that this means to get away from this style of living, just getting rid of the life he has been living for years and this is not an easy thing to do. Watching it is like to be put in front of a big mirror. Soon people around him start to react against his sudden liberty and their final achievement is to eliminate him as a kind of a vengeance, because his real liberty was too aggressive to their hypocrisy. In the end he is assassinated for the same reason those ""two bikers were assassinated in the film Easy Rider"", because he is ""Too Free"" and has been showing to the others their futile and useless way of living. Is a very courageous film.

A great masterpiece on lives that are unfulfilled by living the 24/7 suburbia lifestyle.  A smart criticism of the shallowness that exists in American life and behavior.  Great moments such as the homophobic Marine displayed as a closet gay.A little annoying with it's premise based in &quot;yuppie life.&quot;  For instance, the college kid that carries around a camcorder,  the usual yuppie suburbia cliche of a fairly successful drug dealer, etc...  The important part though is that if you are not someone who has lived this priviledged lifestyle, you can still relate to the characters and their search for truth in the world.  The director deserved the Academy Award.  I can't think of many motion pictures that had this much smoothness to the scenes.  (Even more brilliant when you consider the director was working in an extended portrayal of normal suburbia life.)But I'd also like to tell you about the Awards Edition inserts.  A HUGE disappointment and the main reason I'm lowering this to four stars.  There is a 10-15 minute clip that is excellent with a focus on the director, writer, produers and actors.  But the other two segements are junk.  There is a 10-15 minute clip that is comparable to an Entertainment Tonight clip.  The other 40 or so minutes is dedicated to the director reviewing the story boards for the movie.  Each three picture panel is reviewed on average five minute each and is a great source for sleep. :)  It contains much addolation from the movie makers on how well they pulled off a certain scene from it's story board picture to the actual film, some brilliant insight, but a rip-off.  The &quot;Making Of&quot; portion is a let down.DO NOT MISS this movie though.

I watched this movie several months ago, and approached the whole thing with an open mind, which was probably a good idea as this is not a conventional film in many senses, that's maybe why it's so good. It's the story of a normal dysfunctional suburban family, could be like many others. But the lead character suddenly, rebels, breaks the stereotype and in doing so refuses to be downtrodden anymore. If you like it's about the rise and eventual fall of this anti-hero and how anyone of us in the that situation could do the same. It has the feel of a few other recent movies following a similar track; Fight Club would be another example of this, another one of my favourites. As with this film it asks the question ""Do things have to be this way? And why should we live as others would see us and want us to be"" Definitely a refreshing change from the usual strain of mainstream movies, and the fact that this film was awarded an Oscar is proof of that.  It's not a bitter movie, as the story may suggest, it just emphasises the things around us that over time we may have forgotten. The main character if you like awakens from a slumber of the last 20 years to finally see and appreciate the simple things around him which can give his life purpose. It's a simple idea, but then the simple ideas make the best movies, and this is one of the very best.

But he is far from happy.  Lester hates everything about his life.  He goes to see his daughter cheer at a high school basketball game and sees the nubile, young Angela (Mena Suvari).  He is taken aback by her beauty and has a fantasy involving alot of rose petals.  He ends up quitting his job (getting a great severance deal through blackmail), buys a muscle car, starts jogging and lifting weights to get in shape and takes a job working at a fast food burger joint.  His wife Carolyn (Annette Benning) is an aggressive real estate agent who ends up having an affair with a rival agent, The King (Peter Gallagher).  She can't understand Lester and is constantly nagging him.  Meanwhile their daughter Jane (Thora Birch) starts a relationship with their new next door neighbor, Ricky (Wes Bentley).  Ricky is an intensely weird kid, he films just about everything (including Jane) and just so happens to sell pot.  While Jane &amp; Ricky are becoming more intimate, Ricky is dealing dope to Lester.

67839,A2E3IB2ZHJ7QXJ,0783239408,Private Quentin Tarantino Fan,"[2, 3]","My intial reaction of American Beauty was not really.  It took me a long while to think this movie over, and I must say that American Beauty is a movie that will deliver again and again.  It's not as realistic as people make it out to be, but American Beauty easily transcends these petty complaints with acting, themes, film making.The acting is top notch, and a joy to watch.  Kevin Spacey is brilliant, this is the one that made me always keep my eyes out for any movies that he is in (of course, not all of them are good, but that's not the point).  Just watch the facial expressions, the anger, and the bite that these people put into their lines.  Few movies include such stirring performances, which is just one reason why I can never stop watching this movie.  The fantastic acting is further driven by a script crammed to the brim with top notch dialogue to boot.  Oh sure, it's not Quentin Tarantino, it's better (well maybe not, but it's brilliant).  It's not as rich as his dialogue, but pretty much every line on this is biting, sad, angry, and emotional.  Of course, there's plenty of lines thrown in, to well, you know, add a sense of realism, lines necessary to communicate.(come on, there is no such thing as a person who speaks in non-mundane his whole life).  Thank god, thank god.American Beauty is not a visually striking film in the vein of Fight Club or Eraserhead (especially on first viewing), but once you study the movie a bit and listen to the INSIGHTFUL commentary, the film making aspect will impress.  The camera angles, the lighting effects, the use of all of these is a testament to the expansive pallet of film-making.Another extremely strong point that adds to the movies emotional effects is the absolutely fantastic soundtrack.  I'm not talking about the soundtrack of other artists, which doesn't exactly feature a soundtrack on the par with Quentin Tarantino's mix tapes (though it features some good songs).  I'm talking about Thomas Newman's brilliantly exotic, maudlin, and sentimental score.  It's rife with exotic percussion instruments, and it transcends the movie into a somewhat mystical aura that's utterly jaw-dropping at it's best.  If there's anything that makes the pretentious paper bag scene stike a chord in the firm believers (it's a nice tune to listen to on my own without the paper bag scene _______ up everything).American Beauty really a movie that, despite it's out-there protagonist and psycholigcal leanings, delivers again and again, thanks to fantastic direction and entertainment.  The film can be critized, but it's hard to ignore the many assets this movie has.  And of course, the bonus features only add to the movie, especially that commentary.  It's one of the best movies of the ninties, especially coming from a decade with such movies as Pulp Fiction and Silence of the Lambs.  Absolutely worth watching.Also, the Boston Celtics logo rip-off is probably the worst thing I have ever seen in my life.  Give me a break. Can you at least rip the logo off of the Sacramento Kings or the Los Angeles Clippers, or even the Utah Jazz (Lakers will be NBA champions!!!!!)?  Celtics deserve more respect than that (Being a Lakers fan, I respect and even like the franchise and it's players.  Some of the fans are a different story).B+",4,And To Think I Got This For Five Dollars...,1240444800,"04 23, 2009",2009,3299,"['intial', 'reaction', 'American', 'Beauty', 'was', 'not', 'really', 'took', 'long', 'while', 'think', 'movie', 'must', 'say', 'American', 'Beauty', 'movie', 'will', 'deliver', 'again', 'again', 'not', 'as', 'realistic', 'people', 'make', 'be', 'American', 'Beauty', 'easily', 'petty', 'complaints', 'acting', 'themes', 'film', 'making.The', 'acting', 'top', 'notch', 'joy', 'watch', 'Kevin', 'Spacey', 'brilliant', 'one', 'made', 'always', 'keep', 'eyes', 'out', 'movies', 'course', 'not', 'are', 'good', 'not', 'point', 'Just', 'watch', 'facial', 'expressions', 'anger', 'bite', 'people', 'put', 'lines', 'Few', 'movies', 'include', 'such', 'stirring', 'performances', 'just', 'one', 'reason', 'why', 'can', 'never', 'stop', 'watching', 'movie', 'fantastic', 'acting', 'further', 'driven', 'script', 'crammed', 'brim', 'top', 'notch', 'dialogue', 'boot', 'Oh', 'sure', 'not', 'Quentin', 'Tarantino', 'better', 'well', 'maybe', 'not', 'brilliant', 'not', 'as', 'rich', 'dialogue', 'pretty', 'much', 'line', 'biting', 'sad', 'angry', 'emotional', 'course', 'plenty', 'lines', 'thrown', 'well', 'know', 'add', 'sense', 'realism', 'lines', 'necessary', 'communicate', 'come', 'such', 'thing', 'person', 'who', 'non-mundane', 'whole', 'life', 'Thank', 'god', 'thank', 'god.American', 'Beauty', 'not', 'visually', 'striking', 'film', 'vein', 'Fight', 'Club', 'Eraserhead', 'especially', 'first', 'viewing', 'once', 'study', 'movie', 'bit', 'listen', 'INSIGHTFUL', 'commentary', 'film', 'making', 'aspect', 'will', 'impress', 'camera', 'lighting', 'effects', 'use', 'testament', 'expansive', 'pallet', 'film-making.Another', 'extremely', 'strong', 'point', 'movies', 'emotional', 'effects', 'absolutely', 'fantastic', 'soundtrack', ""'m"", 'not', 'talking', 'soundtrack', 'other', 'artists', ""n't"", 'exactly', 'feature', 'soundtrack', 'par', 'Quentin', 'Tarantino', 'mix', 'tapes', 'good', 'songs', ""'m"", 'talking', 'Thomas', 'Newman', 'brilliantly', 'exotic', 'maudlin', 'sentimental', 'score', 'rife', 'exotic', 'percussion', 'instruments', 'movie', 'somewhat', 'mystical', 'aura', 'utterly', 'jaw-dropping', 'best', 'anything', 'pretentious', 'paper', 'bag', 'scene', 'stike', 'chord', 'firm', 'believers', 'nice', 'tune', 'listen', 'own', 'paper', 'bag', 'scene', '_______', 'up', 'everything', '.American', 'Beauty', 'really', 'movie', 'out-there', 'protagonist', 'psycholigcal', 'leanings', 'delivers', 'again', 'again', 'thanks', 'fantastic', 'direction', 'entertainment', 'film', 'can', 'be', 'critized', 'hard', 'ignore', 'many', 'assets', 'movie', 'course', 'bonus', 'only', 'add', 'movie', 'especially', 'commentary', 'one', 'best', 'movies', 'ninties', 'especially', 'coming', 'decade', 'such', 'movies', 'Pulp', 'Fiction', 'Silence', 'Lambs', 'Absolutely', 'worth', 'watching.Also', 'Boston', 'Celtics', 'logo', 'rip-off', 'probably', 'worst', 'thing', 'have', 'ever', 'seen', 'life', 'Give', 'break', 'Can', 'least', 'rip', 'logo', 'Sacramento', 'Kings', 'Los', 'Angeles', 'Clippers', 'even', 'Utah', 'Jazz', 'Lakers', 'will', 'be', 'NBA', 'champions', 'Celtics', 'deserve', 'more', 'respect', 'Being', 'Lakers', 'fan', 'respect', 'even', 'franchise', 'players', 'fans', 'are', 'different', 'story', '.B+']",Belleza Americana American Beauty  VHS

67842,A2B8G7W3JXKMZA,0783239408,"Randolph Bradley ""RBJ""","[4, 7]","This is my opinion: AMERICAN BEAUTY is an ordinary film.  Not particularly good or bad because this has all been said before about life in general.  For example, THE RULING CLASS (1972) starring Peter O'Toole, shocked England as it portrayed the aristocracy as depraved and God forsaken.  Robert Altman's A WEDDING (1978) with Carol Burnett portrayed dysfunction in American upper classes the same as HOME FROM THE HILL (1960) with Robert Mitchum and George Hamilton and CAT ON A HOT TIN ROOF (1958) with Paul Newman and Elizabeth Taylor, etc., etc.  Thus, dysfunction has been portrayed over and over again and with undisputed critical acclaim.  Perhaps what makes AMERICAN BEAUTY so interesting to so many people is that they themselves are either young (20ish) and going around for the first time, or they never had the opportunity to think freely when that was the thing in the 50's and 60's (remember the hippies?) and freethinking is finally mainstream.  Consequently, AMERICAN BEAUTY gives them a chance to look at social diversity (which is commonplace) without censure.  Whether they went away accepting homosexuals, latent homosexuals, or platonic/sexual love paradoxes, there is nothing new in AMERICAN BEAUTY other than standard movie fare.  Get it?  Moreover, it is my opinion that the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences selects the picture of the year based on what-to them-has the greatest social relevance for that particular year.  Go figure.  Lastly, an upper class American lifestyle perhaps isn't so beautiful after all.",3,This beauty paradox is universal,970617600,"10 4, 2000",2000,1549,"['opinion', 'AMERICAN', 'BEAUTY', 'ordinary', 'film', 'Not', 'particularly', 'good', 'bad', 'been', 'said', 'life', 'general', 'example', 'THE', 'RULING', 'CLASS', '1972', 'starring', 'Peter', ""O'Toole"", 'shocked', 'England', 'portrayed', 'aristocracy', 'depraved', 'God', 'forsaken', 'Robert', 'Altman', 'A', 'WEDDING', '1978', 'Carol', 'Burnett', 'portrayed', 'dysfunction', 'American', 'upper', 'same', 'HOME', 'THE', 'HILL', '1960', 'Robert', 'Mitchum', 'George', 'Hamilton', 'CAT', 'ON', 'A', 'HOT', 'TIN', 'ROOF', '1958', 'Paul', 'Newman', 'Elizabeth', 'Taylor', 'etc.', 'etc', 'Thus', 'dysfunction', 'been', 'portrayed', 'over', 'again', 'undisputed', 'critical', 'acclaim', 'Perhaps', 'what', 'AMERICAN', 'BEAUTY', 'so', 'interesting', 'so', 'many', 'people', 'are', 'young', '20ish', 'going', 'around', 'first', 'time', 'never', 'had', 'opportunity', 'think', 'freely', 'when', 'was', 'thing', '50', '60', 'remember', 'hippies', 'freethinking', 'finally', 'mainstream', 'Consequently', 'AMERICAN', 'BEAUTY', 'chance', 'look', 'social', 'diversity', 'commonplace', 'censure', 'went', 'away', 'accepting', 'homosexuals', 'latent', 'homosexuals', 'platonic/sexual', 'love', 'paradoxes', 'nothing', 'new', 'AMERICAN', 'BEAUTY', 'other', 'standard', 'movie', 'fare', 'Get', 'Moreover', 'opinion', 'Academy', 'Motion', 'Picture', 'Arts', 'Sciences', 'picture', 'year', 'based', 'what-to', 'them-has', 'greatest', 'social', 'relevance', 'particular', 'year', 'Go', 'figure', 'Lastly', 'upper', 'class', 'American', 'lifestyle', 'perhaps', ""n't"", 'so', 'beautiful']",Belleza Americana American Beauty  VHS

It's dark with a lot of twists and yet, at the same time, lighthearted and humorous.AMERICAN BEAUTY takes place in a modern-day suburban American town. It basically revolves around two particular families living next door to each other in a quiet neighborhood. The first family: the Burnhams - Lester Burnham (Kevin Spacey), Carolyn Burnham (Annette Bening), and Jane Burnham (Thora Birch). Lester is the father, and he is going through a mid-life crisis. He has even fallen in love with Jane's new friend, Angela Hayes (Mena Suvari) by her beauty. Caroyln is the perfect mother who has to have everything perfect - everything and everyone. Jane is the rebellious teenager who can't seem to appreciate anything her parents give her or do for her.Family number two: the Fitts - Colonel Frank (Chris Cooper), Barbra (Allison Jenny), and Ricky (Wes Bentley). The Colonel Frank is the father, a retired US miltary colonel who is hard on his son - to the point of abusive - and even though he claims his son is a homosexual, he is actually a homosexual himself, though you don't really find that out until the end. Barbra is mainly silent throughout this film, and doesn't have a lot of lines so you can't really know what her character is like, though she often forgets and is lost in her daydreams a lot. Ricky is the son, and he films everything that is beautiful or interesting to him - which is how he and Jane meet, because he was filming her all the time. He also is very confident and calm about everything, and is afraid of his father, though he never likes showing or admiting it.A beautiful film about a man in his mid-life crisis and falling for the beauty of his teenage daughter's best friend. The ending is very surprising, and the film didn't really live up to all of my expectations....The bonus added stuff to AMERICAN BEAUTY is really good, but couldn't they have just added the special edition stuff to the same video tape as the movie itself because then this wouldn't have to be a double video. Oh well. This is still a very good movie, and I really recommend it. But I don't think it really deserved all those Oscars. I really think THE SIXTH SENSE still should've won Best Picture.

67848,A1J2931UBBJPXM,0783239408,Reviewer,"[2, 4]","Souls are bared and individual vulnerability is exposed in this film in which the dysfunctional family becomes the norm, and a man at last confronts the fact that his life is simply not as it should be, and determines to do something about it.  ""American Beauty,"" directed by Sam Mendes and starring Kevin Spacey and Annette Bening, rips the facade from a typical American family to reveal a not-so-typical family after all.  Or are they?  For who among us, living in this finely woven tapestry that is modern American life, can really define ""typical?""  Or for that matter, ""normal?""  In what is to be the final year of his life (though he doesn't know it), Lester Burnham (Spacey) finally acknowledges to himself that he is in a loveless marriage, has a dead end job, and has for some time (too long) been a mere observer, rather than a participant, in his own life.  His wife, Carolyn (Bening), a fledgling real estate broker, disdains him, and his teenaged daughter, Jane (Thora Birch), accords him nothing but disrespect.  He has a new neighbor, Colonel Frank Fitts (Chris Cooper), a U.S. Marine who is the virtual embodiment of the ""Corps,"" with a wife, Barbara (Allison Janney), he has disciplined into a trance-like state of existence, and a teenaged son, Ricky (Wes Bentley), who sees beauty in the least likely of places.It's a stylized, thought provoking film in which Mendes lowers the mask and raises a mirror to reflect the true nature of a society too often willing to cast the first stone while refusing to first seek out the detritus in it's own eye.  Devoid of stereotypes, the characters herein represent a realistic and concise cross-section of individuals who form, not only the periphery, but the core of that very same society.  And though personal experience and frame of reference will go far in determining how accepting a viewer may be of this picture of urban misalignment Mendes presents, there is no denying the reality of the attitudes and situations represented here.  To deny this depiction as accurate would merely be a turning away from the truth.Once again demonstrating that he is one of the finest actors around, Kevin Spacey deservedly won the Best Actor Oscar for his portrayal of Lester.  It's a finely tuned expression of a middle-aged man, not just in crisis, but lost in soul wrenching turmoil.  Many may find it difficult to sympathize to any great extent with Spacey's Lester, but regardless, they (as well as those who are able to sympathize with him) will at least be able to identify with him.  For in Lester we find all of the variances and complexities that make up this journey we call life.  And Spacey captures it all, from Lester's apathy and ambiguity, to the emotional peaks and valleys of his epiphany, with a truly memorable performance.Annette Bening, also, turns in one of her best performances, for which she was nominated for Best Actress.  She shines as Carolyn, a woman repressed and frustrated who hides her discontent with hyperactivity and denial, and puts on a mask of pretentiousness that is so animated at times that it's nerve-wracking to watch.  But it's a great piece of acting, through which she certainly brings her character to life.Giving a performance that demands mention, as well, is Wes Bentley, who achieves an introspective depth with his character that establishes what a tremendous ability he has as an actor.  This is one young man from whom we can expect great things in the future.The supporting cast includes Peter Gallagher (Buddy Kane), Mena Suvari (Angela), Scott Bakula (Jim), Sam Robards (""JB""), Barry Del Sherman (Brad) and Erin Cathryn Strubbe (Young Jane).  A cutting-edge character study, ""American Beauty"" is a probing and revealing contemporary fable that is uncompromisingly honest; probably too honest for some.  It's a film that refuses to allow the viewer to take an ""ignorance is bliss"" stance, and instead insists on a truth that lays waste to hypocrisy and self-righteousness.  For when you're forced to stare into a mirror, there is only one image you're going to see staring back; and whether or not you like what you see is going to be entirely up to you.  And therein lies the real impact of this film.",5,Uncompromising Character Study,986774400,"04 9, 2001",2001,4214,"['Souls', 'are', 'bared', 'individual', 'vulnerability', 'exposed', 'film', 'dysfunctional', 'family', 'norm', 'man', 'last', 'confronts', 'fact', 'life', 'simply', 'not', 'should', 'be', 'determines', 'do', 'something', 'American', 'Beauty', 'directed', 'Sam', 'Mendes', 'starring', 'Kevin', 'Spacey', 'Annette', 'Bening', 'facade', 'typical', 'American', 'family', 'reveal', 'not-so-typical', 'family', 'are', 'who', 'living', 'finely', 'woven', 'tapestry', 'modern', 'American', 'life', 'can', 'really', 'define', 'typical', 'matter', 'normal', 'what', 'be', 'final', 'year', 'life', ""n't"", 'know', 'Lester', 'Burnham', 'Spacey', 'finally', 'loveless', 'marriage', 'dead', 'end', 'job', 'time', 'too', 'long', 'been', 'mere', 'observer', 'rather', 'participant', 'own', 'life', 'wife', 'Carolyn', 'Bening', 'fledgling', 'real', 'estate', 'broker', 'teenaged', 'daughter', 'Jane', 'Thora', 'Birch', 'nothing', 'disrespect', 'new', 'neighbor', 'Colonel', 'Frank', 'Fitts', 'Chris', 'Cooper', 'U.S.', 'Marine', 'who', 'virtual', 'embodiment', 'Corps', 'wife', 'Barbara', 'Allison', 'Janney', 'disciplined', 'trance-like', 'state', 'existence', 'teenaged', 'son', 'Ricky', 'Wes', 'Bentley', 'who', 'beauty', 'least', 'likely', 'places.It', 'stylized', 'thought', 'provoking', 'film', 'Mendes', 'mask', 'mirror', 'reflect', 'true', 'nature', 'society', 'too', 'often', 'willing', 'cast', 'first', 'stone', 'refusing', 'first', 'seek', 'out', 'detritus', 'own', 'eye', 'Devoid', 'stereotypes', 'characters', 'herein', 'represent', 'realistic', 'concise', 'cross-section', 'individuals', 'who', 'form', 'not', 'only', 'periphery', 'core', 'very', 'same', 'society', 'personal', 'experience', 'frame', 'reference', 'will', 'go', 'far', 'determining', 'how', 'accepting', 'viewer', 'may', 'be', 'picture', 'urban', 'misalignment', 'Mendes', 'presents', 'denying', 'reality', 'attitudes', 'situations', 'represented', 'here', 'deny', 'depiction', 'accurate', 'would', 'merely', 'be', 'turning', 'away', 'truth.Once', 'again', 'demonstrating', 'one', 'finest', 'actors', 'Kevin', 'Spacey', 'deservedly', 'won', 'Best', 'Actor', 'Oscar', 'portrayal', 'Lester', 'finely', 'tuned', 'expression', 'middle-aged', 'man', 'not', 'just', 'crisis', 'lost', 'soul', 'wrenching', 'turmoil', 'Many', 'may', 'find', 'difficult', 'sympathize', 'great', 'extent', 'Spacey', 'Lester', 'regardless', 'as', 'well', 'who', 'are', 'able', 'sympathize', 'will', 'least', 'be', 'able', 'identify', 'Lester', 'find', 'variances', 'complexities', 'make', 'up', 'journey', 'call', 'life', 'Spacey', 'Lester', 'apathy', 'ambiguity', 'emotional', 'peaks', 'valleys', 'epiphany', 'truly', 'memorable', 'performance.Annette', 'Bening', 'also', 'one', 'best', 'performances', 'was', 'nominated', 'Best', 'Actress', 'Carolyn', 'woman', 'repressed', 'frustrated', 'who', 'discontent', 'hyperactivity', 'denial', 'mask', 'pretentiousness', 'so', 'animated', 'times', 'nerve-wracking', 'watch', 'great', 'piece', 'acting', 'certainly', 'character', 'life.Giving', 'performance', 'mention', 'as', 'well', 'Wes', 'Bentley', 'who', 'introspective', 'depth', 'character', 'what', 'tremendous', 'ability', 'actor', 'one', 'young', 'man', 'whom', 'can', 'expect', 'great', 'things', 'future.The', 'supporting', 'cast', 'Peter', 'Gallagher', 'Buddy', 'Kane', 'Mena', 'Suvari', 'Angela', 'Scott', 'Bakula', 'Jim', 'Sam', 'Robards', 'JB', 'Barry', 'Del', 'Sherman', 'Brad', 'Erin', 'Cathryn', 'Strubbe', 'Young', 'Jane', 'cutting-edge', 'character', 'study', 'American', 'Beauty', 'probing', 'revealing', 'contemporary', 'fable', 'uncompromisingly', 'honest', 'probably', 'too', 'honest', 'film', 'allow', 'viewer', 'take', 'ignorance', 'bliss', 'stance', 'instead', 'insists', 'truth', 'waste', 'hypocrisy', 'self-righteousness', 'when', ""'re"", 'forced', 'stare', 'mirror', 'only', 'one', 'image', ""'re"", 'going', 'see', 'staring', 'back', 'not', 'like', 'what', 'see', 'going', 'be', 'entirely', 'therein', 'real', 'impact', 'film']",Belleza Americana American Beauty  VHS

What's important is that this is a first screenplay from Alan Ball, and he deserved his Oscar. Sam Mendes put it all in perspective, and brought a brilliant cast to fruition. A lot of this is about middle-age angst, but there are terrific insights about current young person's issues. Wes Bentley is wonderful, as is Thora Birch, and, later, Mena Suvari. The film really centers around Kevin Spacey and he deserved his Oscar. Some may take issue that Annette Benning should've won. (She lost to Hilary Swank, who was in almost every frame of &quot;Boys Don't Cry&quot;)Phenomenal extra characters, and Chris Cooper was exceptional as Bentley's gung-ho military father (nominated for a SAG award). Peter Gallagher hasn't had as good a role since Altman's &quot;Short Cuts&quot;. His scenes with Benning are amusing.The plot twists are plenty, and the ending already told at the beginning. The problem with the current DVD is that there were alternate endings, not included; and it would really be fun to find out other things might've been going on.

The gay neighbor and distanced wife see it in the Leave it to Beaver ideal.But the most beautiful character of all is the artist, who pulls together the most coherent, stunning, socially critical film on a level with Fight Club.

But this one had overly stereotypical characters and little originality.One of the worst examples of this was the white middle class houswife/real estate agent trying unsuccessfully sell a house. She over acted the part of the phony, foolish salesperson who did not connect with the customers.

67862,A19ZXK9HHVRV1X,0783239408,Roland E. Zwick,"[1, 2]","If you've ever wondered what life was really like in the Ozzie and Harriet household after the cameras stopped rolling, ""American Beauty"" might well afford you a good indication.  Although this is certainly not the first glimpse into the dark underbelly of modern suburban life - films like ""Ordinary People"" and ""Blue Velvet"" long ago shattered any myths about the subject - ""American Beauty"" is clearly one of the grimmest and least compromising.  Writer Alan Ball and director Sam Mendes paint a disturbing portrait of a family and a neighborhood in serious moral crisis.  They transport us on an often painful journey to a world whose residents lead lives of quiet desperation cozily hidden behind the tranquil faade of tree-lined streets, white picket fences and exquisitely manicured lawns and gardens - a neighborhood and, perhaps, even a family not too unlike some of our own.In his Oscar-winning performance, Kevin Spacey stars as Lester, a 42-year old man suffering a major case of mid-life angst, stuck, like so many other men in his age bracket, in both a dreary, meaningless job and a dreary, meaningless marriage, in his case to a consumer-conscious wife whose personality has long since been drained of the passion and spontaneity that once defined it.  Lester also has an alienated teenage daughter who suffers from feelings of worthlessness and a consequent inability to relate in any positive way to either her parents or the materialistic life they have made for her.  Feeling utterly empty, Lester begins to become infatuated with his daughter's beautiful blonde schoolmate, an obsession that leads to pedophilic fantasies as well as tortured feelings of unrequited passion.What is remarkable about the film is that Ball and Mendes don't concentrate merely on Lester's problems but manage to weave a full tapestry of suburban despair by shifting their focus to a wide assortment of other characters as well.  Many of the secondary characters, who could easily have slipped over into stereotype or caricature, actually are allowed to breathe and develop in three-dimensional ways.  Thus, we come to understand that, in her own way, Carolyn, Lester's wife, is just as unfulfilled as he is and just as unsure of how to cope with that bewildering situation.  Jane, his daughter, is just a good-hearted kid who craves affection and moral guidance from parents who seem too self-possessed or too emotionally burnt-out to provide her with those needs.  Like so many of today's youth, she suffers from feelings of inadequacy because she doesn't measure up to society's view of ideal physical perfection - her main goal in life is to undergo breast augmentation - and she really only wants to find someone who will love and accept her on a deeper, more spiritual level.  This she finds in the form of Ricky Fitts, her strangely ""different"" next-door neighbor, a boy who spends his life filming his experiences and whose amazing self-confidence and self-assurance inspire others to label him psychotic and Jane to fall in love with him.  Ricky is, perhaps, the most controversial element of the film because his blatant drug dealing never seems to come under any moral censure by the film's makers.  After all, at least Lester eventually backs off from his planned conquest of Angela, the seeming nymphet, at the last moment.  She also is revealed as a complex character, a girl so afraid of being ""ordinary"" that she devises an entirely fictional persona to present to a world that, ironically, really doesn't care about her anyway.  In a way, Angela defines the theme of the film, in that it seems to suggest that there really is no such thing as ""ordinary"" in terms of human existence and that we all spend our lives in a fruitless attempt to achieve or at least replicate it.  Of the entire cast of characters, Ricky's father, a homophobic, hardnosed ex-Marine, perhaps suffers from the worst case of just such self-denial and emotional repression.  Thus, he becomes the device through which the final tragic outcome is eventually set into motion.All involved - writer, director, actors, cinematographer Conrad Hall - deserve immense kudos for their moral courage and their technical expertise.  Still, one begins to wonder if all these thoroughly dire views of suburban life are really any more true or accurate than the preposterously sunny portrayals of the 1950's.  Isn't it possible that the truth may - as with all aspects of life - lie somewhere in between?  ""American Beauty"" takes us to a particular place filled with a particular group of people.  As a result, it is safe to say that, while it provides ""a"" vision of modern suburban life, it is yet to be shown that it provides ""the"" definitive vision.  Like all great art, it offers only a part of the overall picture - but that part, in this particular case, is profoundly disturbing and truly unforgettable.",4,often shattering view of American

You wouldn't want to be in anyone else's shoes.I think that's a major theme in this movie. These families had deep, jarring, jugular issues.

67866,A1TK6R2JSC97HL,0783239408,Rottenberg's rotten book review,"[16, 28]","Beauty"" begins with Lester Burnham (Spacey), so beaten down by lifeless routine, that he has lost even the ability to feel pain or anything.  Lester's harpy of a wife Carolyn (Benning), a status-hungry real-estate velociraptor is only capable of dishing out bile.  Between the two suffers Jane, their self-loathing daughter (Thora Birch from ""Ghost World).  We also meet those who surround them, a gay couple; a retired homophobic marine; his catatonic wife, their seemingly psychotic, voyeuristic and pot-selling son Ricky, and Jane's obviously psychotically vain friend Angela.Life though beautiful obviously isn't as nice as it looks.  Lester's cozy suburban home encloses his frigid wife and remote daughter, and for him it's a loveless shelter when he's not at work in his dead-end job.  Then something happens: On the verge of losing his job, Lester quits and blackmails his boss for a generous severance package. Now free, after a fashion, he entertains lustful thoughts of Angela while buying weed from Ricky, who unbeknownst to Lester, has become Jane's lover.  Freed from the daily grind, and with Ricky and Angela seeming to urge him on, Lester recreates himself as a teenager, directionless and determined at the same time. His approach to life disdains the carpediem that typified Hollywood ""Dead Poets"" rip-offs of the early 1990's for something more along ""let the day pass you by."" His wife, determined to succeed in real estate, is revealed not just amoral, but stunningly shallow - a walking manifestation of sheer materialism and ostentation. All who populate ""Beauty"" live in some illusion - Lester with his renewed youth, Carolyn and her dreams of success, Ricky and Sarah and their fantasies of a future together, Angela's fantasy of herself on the cover of ""Elle"", Ricky's father's mirage of the all-American family..etc. After meandering, the script decides that somebody will have to wake up and take reality on the chin for everybody else - and the script settles on Jane and Ricky.  Bad move: Jane and Ricky prove so mature in their love for each other, that they prove better able to wake up and smell the coffee than the rest of the cast.  Instead of a searing portrait of the disintegration of family life, Ricky and Jane prove that love and the family is alive and well.  The closer they get, the more we realize that Jane won't be destroyed by her self-loathing, and that Ricky's not really a psycho at all.  (If children are our future, then we could do far worse than Ricky and Jane.)  As Ricky and Jane straighten themselves out. The rest of the flick seems out of whack - as if the script suddenly became terrified of its capacity for mass destruction and wanted to turn into a sunny parody of its earlier self.  Jane contemplates life without bust enlargement; Carolyn's crass materialism, never disavowed, is mollified by her affair and possible love for her competitor in the real estate market (surprisingly refreshing Peter Gallagher); and Lester's attraction for Jane's friend is more mutual than irony should allow.  The only constant in this perfect storm is Ricky's father, a die-hard Marine whose only apparent role is to set the story firmly in America (apparently the only Western nation that British-born director Sam Mendes can conceive of teeming with right-wing, jingoistic, homophobic, militaristic robots).The script's sudden risk-shyness infects the characters so, that by the end of the film, all they can do is feel satisfied with each other. Even Lester, the most beaten down of them all, feels fine.I enjoyed the leads of this flick enough to overlook how otherwise overrated it really is. ""American Beauty"" never exploits its fictional setting to achieve any sharper edge on a now well-worn theme of the darkness underlying American family life. Surprisingly, it never explains the film's core plot point: Burnham's dramatic character shift (occurring in the film, but apparently late in life).  We get the idea that people have treated him like dirt for ages, yet in the first shot, he's already equipped to turn the tables on his boss and his wife, and attract Angela as well.What undermines the film the most is the persistent hint that those on the other side of the camera may be in thrall to the greatest illusion of all - that this really is a deep look at the shattered psyche of the American family that hasn't been done to death decades ago.",2,Study in American Misanthropy by Brit director,1121904000,"07 21, 2005",2005,4411,"['Beauty', 'Lester', 'Burnham', 'Spacey', 'so', 'beaten', 'down', 'lifeless', 'routine', 'lost', 'even', 'ability', 'feel', 'pain', 'anything', 'Lester', 'harpy', 'wife', 'Carolyn', 'Benning', 'status-hungry', 'real-estate', 'velociraptor', 'only', 'capable', 'dishing', 'out', 'bile', 'two', 'suffers', 'Jane', 'self-loathing', 'daughter', 'Thora', 'Birch', 'Ghost', 'World', 'also', 'meet', 'who', 'surround', 'gay', 'couple', 'retired', 'homophobic', 'marine', 'catatonic', 'wife', 'seemingly', 'psychotic', 'voyeuristic', 'pot-selling', 'son', 'Ricky', 'Jane', 'obviously', 'psychotically', 'vain', 'friend', 'Angela.Life', 'beautiful', 'obviously', ""n't"", 'as', 'nice', 'Lester', 'cozy', 'suburban', 'home', 'frigid', 'wife', 'remote', 'daughter', 'loveless', 'shelter', 'when', 'not', 'work', 'dead-end', 'job', 'Then', 'something', 'happens', 'verge', 'losing', 'job', 'Lester', 'quits', 'blackmails', 'boss', 'generous', 'severance', 'package', 'Now', 'free', 'fashion', 'lustful', 'thoughts', 'Angela', 'buying', 'weed', 'Ricky', 'who', 'unbeknownst', 'Lester', 'become', 'Jane', 'lover', 'Freed', 'daily', 'grind', 'Ricky', 'Angela', 'seeming', 'urge', 'Lester', 'teenager', 'directionless', 'determined', 'same', 'time', 'approach', 'life', 'carpediem', 'typified', 'Hollywood', 'Dead', 'Poets', 'rip-offs', 'early', '1990', 'something', 'more', 'let', 'day', 'pass', 'wife', 'determined', 'succeed', 'real', 'estate', 'revealed', 'not', 'just', 'amoral', 'stunningly', 'shallow', 'walking', 'manifestation', 'sheer', 'materialism', 'ostentation', 'who', 'populate', 'Beauty', 'live', 'illusion', 'Lester', 'renewed', 'youth', 'Carolyn', 'dreams', 'success', 'Ricky', 'Sarah', 'fantasies', 'future', 'together', 'Angela', 'fantasy', 'herself', 'cover', 'Elle', 'Ricky', 'father', 'mirage', 'all-American', 'family..etc', 'meandering', 'script', 'somebody', 'will', 'have', 'wake', 'up', 'take', 'reality', 'chin', 'everybody', 'else', 'script', 'Jane', 'Ricky', 'Bad', 'move', 'Jane', 'Ricky', 'prove', 'so', 'mature', 'love', 'other', 'prove', 'better', 'able', 'wake', 'up', 'smell', 'coffee', 'rest', 'cast', 'Instead', 'searing', 'portrait', 'disintegration', 'family', 'life', 'Ricky', 'Jane', 'prove', 'love', 'family', 'alive', 'well', 'closer', 'get', 'more', 'realize', 'Jane', 'wo', ""n't"", 'be', 'destroyed', 'self-loathing', 'Ricky', 'not', 'really', 'psycho', 'children', 'are', 'future', 'then', 'could', 'do', 'far', 'worse', 'Ricky', 'Jane', 'Ricky', 'Jane', 'straighten', 'out', 'rest', 'flick', 'whack', 'script', 'suddenly', 'became', 'terrified', 'capacity', 'mass', 'destruction', 'wanted', 'turn', 'sunny', 'parody', 'earlier', 'self', 'Jane', 'life', 'bust', 'enlargement', 'Carolyn', 'crass', 'materialism', 'never', 'disavowed', 'mollified', 'affair', 'possible', 'love', 'competitor', 'real', 'estate', 'market', 'surprisingly', 'refreshing', 'Peter', 'Gallagher', 'Lester', 'attraction', 'Jane', 'friend', 'more', 'mutual', 'irony', 'should', 'allow', 'only', 'constant', 'perfect', 'storm', 'Ricky', 'father', 'die-hard', 'Marine', 'only', 'apparent', 'role', 'set', 'story', 'firmly', 'America', 'apparently', 'only', 'Western', 'nation', 'British-born', 'director', 'Sam', 'Mendes', 'can', 'conceive', 'teeming', 'right-wing', 'jingoistic', 'homophobic', 'militaristic', 'robots', '.The', 'script', 'sudden', 'risk-shyness', 'characters', 'so', 'end', 'film', 'can', 'do', 'feel', 'satisfied', 'other', 'Even', 'Lester', 'most', 'beaten', 'feels', 'fine.I', 'enjoyed', 'leads', 'flick', 'enough', 'overlook', 'how', 'otherwise', 'overrated', 'really', 'American', 'Beauty', 'never', 'fictional', 'setting', 'achieve', 'sharper', 'edge', 'now', 'well-worn', 'theme', 'darkness', 'underlying', 'American', 'family', 'life', 'Surprisingly', 'never', 'film', 'core', 'plot', 'point', 'Burnham', 'dramatic', 'character', 'shift', 'occurring', 'film', 'apparently', 'late', 'life', 'get', 'idea', 'people', 'have', 'treated', 'dirt', 'ages', 'yet', 'first', 'shot', 'already', 'equipped', 'turn', 'tables', 'boss', 'wife', 'attract', 'Angela', 'film', 'most', 'persistent', 'hint', 'other', 'side', 'camera', 'may', 'be', 'thrall', 'greatest', 'illusion', 'really', 'deep', 'look', 'shattered', 'psyche', 'American', 'family', ""n't"", 'been', 'done', 'death', 'decades', 'ago']",Belleza Americana American Beauty  VHS

67869,A159CY9F6RT2N3,0783239408,R. W. Holliston,"[3, 4]","American Beauty did very little for me the first time around. Its indictment of the &quot;American way of life&quot; has been done many times before, and often better. And I agree with another reviewer who suggested  that not every homophobe is a closet case (that's just the way the world  works). I was also put off by the extraordinary number of cliches in the  dialogue. But on second viewing, I realized that that's exactly how these  people would talk.  I appreciated it more the second time, although I still  feel it was overrated, and that Kevin Spacey should not have won the Oscar  over Russell Crowe's intense and multifarious performance in The Insider.  But my second viewing also reinforced my feeling that the two central  performances (and characters) are the weakest parts of the film. Spacey has  done this kind of oddball, world-weary character enough times already -  he's a great actor, and not uninteresting even just marking time, but  that's what he's doing here. Annette Bening is (I'm agreeing with another  reviewer here) unbearably shrill and one-note: she's capable of much better  (I'd love to have seen Bebe Neuwirth in this role). The young actors are  much better, as is the underrated Chris Cooper in a difficult role. Peter  Gallagher is wasted as an underdeveloped minor character. One thing that  annoyed me about this film is the way the director assumes we will  sympathize with Spacey's character over Bening's. She's often right: there  is nothing intrinsically admirable about impulsively quitting your job when  you have a family to look after; sex can be fun and spontaneous without  spilling beer all over the living room furniture; it is not unreasonable to  expect some gratitude from your husband and daughter when you come home  after a long day's work to cook them a &quot;nutritious yet savory&quot;  dinner. American Beauty opens with Lester wanking in the shower:  metaphorically, he wanks all the way through the film.  Because of the  complicated relationships between the younger characters, this is a must  see. Cooper's enactment of a deeply conflicted person is also worth  experiencing. The filming is expert. But American Beauty has a hole at its  center: the two leading characters don't work.

67875,A1K94LXX833JTT,0783239408,Sanpete,"[2, 6]","American Beauty is a complex film that moves in difficult territory with mixed results.  I admired and enjoyed many things about it, particularly the acting, cinematography and editing, along with some of the sharp humor.  However, there are some important parts that seem on reflection not to fit together or just not to work, and there is one key thread that's particularly ugly.Right at the start, Lester (Spacey) tells us he will soon be dead.  He appears to be a typical middle American in suburbia, with a wife and teenaged daughter, and the basic ingredients of the American Dream.  Under this surface is a seething anger and bitter unhappiness; the whole family is miserable.  Lester already feels dead inside.In the bottom of this mid-life trench Lester suddenly finds himself awakened to life, at least in his fantasies, by a roughly 16-year-old girl, his daughter's friend.  (There are references to Lolita throughout the film.)  This acts as a catalyst for a full retreat into an adolescent state of mind in which he feels reconnected and vital, more or less.  He quits his white-collar job, blackmails his former employer, gets a job at a burger joint, buys the 1970 Firebird he always wanted, and fantasizes about the high school girl.  When he finally arrives at the consummation of his fantasy, a shock brings him to a new state of mind.  There are also a couple subplots that come together at the end.The title and the generic suburban setting suggest that Lester and his family are representative of middle America, and Lester himself says he's just an ordinary guy.  If so, it's according to a very cynical view.  The film seems to be shaped, and deformed, by an overall cynicism, despite what appear to be genuine efforts to show compassion, moral development and even happiness.  There is an epilogue that seems sincere, beautiful and optimistic, but either it doesn't fit with the rest of the film or it too is cynical.The epilogue is beautifully presented, but dramatically it's curiously undermined, made ironic, commented on, or at least brought into question by cuts to the denouement of a bloody whodunit subplot.  The epilogue is also phrased in a self-negating way: ""gratitude"" and ""stupid little life"" are incongruously joined in one sentence.  Its sudden bliss, taken at face value, seems to negate the significance of the suffering shown through the rest of the film, as though some kind of nirvana has magically resulted.  And the final thought in the epilogue is hard to take seriously in the context of the film as a whole: that we'll all know exactly what the epilogue refers to someday (when we die).  Do the filmmakers really believe that?  Or is this part of the dark humor--the epilogue is no more real than the appearance of happiness for Lester's family was at the beginning?Or, as seems most likely to me, is the ending confused because the conflict between the cynicism and efforts at something better, and possibly the need for a more Hollywood ending, has mixed things up?The script actually began as a story about the real-life Amy Fisher, the ""Long Island Lolita"" who tried to kill her lover's wife.  The finished script was very different, but it was still framed by prison scenes and a murder trial.  After filming was complete the director changed that and other key points.  The DVD commentary by the director and the writer is remarkable for the way the director does almost all the talking.  At the end, the writer says he's found the director's comments very enlightening, that he never knew that was the director's intent, but that it all makes perfect sense.  It doesn't.No doubt some of the confusion of the film comes from the tortured process by which it went from one plot to a very different one, even at the last minute.  My hunch is that the director was trying to keep the film from being so negative that audiences would reject it.  He says he tried to keep Lester on the edge of what the audience could accept.  Reportedly, the script had him further over that edge.  It's no wonder the writer was so quiet about the end result.  The oddly presented and seemingly self-negating epilogue appears to sum up the competing forces that collided in the making of the film and were never quite harmonized.Despite the visual beauty of the film, it fails to be profound about beauty where it seems to try hardest.  A major theme is finding beauty in unexpected places, including death.  This isn't a profound truth as presented.  We seem to be asked to take seriously the idea that the dead have a special beauty akin to glimpsing God, but all we see in the main example, Lester himself dead, is the graphic quality of a ""still life"" (admired in the commentary as ""like a painting""), along with an awed reaction shot.  Any beauty in that is no different than that of a bowl of fruit, and is a very superficial way to view the death of a man.  Maybe it's the bliss of the epilogue that's supposed to be glimpsed in the dead but, again, the epilogue is hard to fit with the film overall, and even with itself.*Spoiler alert,* for this paragraph only.  (You might be able to guess some points from the following, though I won't actually say what they are, and you may still be surprised.)  To me, a particularly unpleasant aspect of the film has to do with the way Lester's relation with the the young object of his fantasies is presented.  Without giving anything away directly, what Lester does is treated as acceptable and harmless.  In the commentary, the director says Lester didn't abuse the girl, that he was gentle, that she could have said no, and that's the attitude reflected in the film.  She's about 16; Lester's over twice that.  No matter how experienced she could have been, how gentle he was, whether she said yes or no or nothing at all, and no matter how it all finally ended up, what Lester did was still inexcusable because of the vast difference in maturity and power.  It's a complex issue, but this kind of thing is far from harmless and seeing it treated as harmless in a graphic way, and excusing it for the reasons given, is ugly.  (The novel Lolita doesn't make the same mistake.)The film remains interesting not only despite its flaws but in part because of them.  The attempt to deal with its themes and bring them together in a satisfying way sharpens some questions even when it appears to fail.  Does Lester really become happy in his fantasies?  Are his fantasies beautiful or pathetic (there's a fair amount of evidence that the latter was intended, that the ""beauty"" was ironic).  What did Lester arrive at before he died (and why didn't the film develop that, cutting it off immediately)?  Is it possible to harmonize the things the film seems to try to bring together?",4,Look closer ... at this film,1141689600,"03 7, 2006",2006,6761,"['American', 'Beauty', 'complex', 'film',

67877,A26WVK274IA7DN,0783239408,Sarah Bellum,"[1, 2]","From the opening moments of the movie, we know Lester Burnham is going to die; we just do not know the specifics, nor do we realize how little the knowledge of his demise will detract from our enjoyment of the film leading up to this final act. Things appear to be perfectly fine in the Burnham household: Lester and Carolyn are both gainfully employed, have a large, beautiful house in suburbia, drive luxury automobiles and their healthy, robust teenaged daughter is a cheerleader on the high school squad. Yet, every seasoned filmgoer knows to never trust appearances. Carolyn's career as a real estate agent isn't going well, so she's hoping that sleeping with the enormously successful real estate king will help rub off some of his fortune. Lester, on the other hand, doesn't have a career; he has a job. In fact, he has had the same job with the same employer for several years. The distinction between ""career"" and ""job"" is vitally important to those of us who merely have a ""job."" Sure, it might pay reasonably well, though not necessarily. A ""job,"" however, is not something we envision ourselves doing for the rest of our lives and it is certainly not how we define ourselves. In fact, we would rather not respond when asked what we do for a living. It simply does not matter to us. What is worse, Lester does not have a sense of identity. ""That's okay. I wouldn't remember me either,"" he responds when one of his wife's acquaintances mistakenly thinks they are meeting for the first time. Perhaps not many people can identify with this, though I certainly can. Lester and I are equally unremarkable, failing to make an impression on most people we meet. Maybe at one point in the past, or even still today deep down, we want to remain anonymous. It does have its advantages at times. It is often frustrating or embarrassing, however, and we realize this. Sometimes when people are indistinct, yet want to be noticed, they resort to drastic tactics. This is how murder sprees happen. But I digress. Rather than murder people, Lester nonetheless does take radical measures. With an unloving wife and a daughter who finds him an embarrassment, he chooses to quit everything in an effort to start over. In a quest to redefine himself, he returns to life the way it was before he was supposed to define himself. He was much more comfortable then. ""I want the job with the least amount of responsibility,"" he tells the teenaged manager of the fast food restaurant at which he applies for a job. Few responsibilities, not accountable to anyone and no one accountable to him; hanging out, lifting weights and smoking pot; this is life the way it was meant to be. Unfortunately for Lester, the young man (Wes Bentley) supplying him with weed happens to have an authoritarian, unenlightened father (Chris Cooper) with a particularly strong homophobic streak. Some misunderstandings occur and trouble ensues. While this film might not appeal to all tastes, judging from the high ratings and overwhelmingly positive reviews that many people see much of themselves in the characters portrayed in this film.

It is about who we are, what we project ourselves as, and most importantly what we deny ourselves in order to appear a certain way to the outside world.  This is a great movie.  Its plot twist and turns.  Its characters change and grow before our eyes.  Its filming and direction  by Sam Mendes is smart, witty, and beautiful.  This film is worth seeing once, and then worth seeing again.This film and its characters will remind you of both people you know and yourself.  This story is about a &quot;typical&quot; American family.  Lester Burnham (played by Academy Award winning Kevin Spacey) and his wife Carolyn Burnham (played by Academy Award Nominee Annette Bening) are a so-called happily married couple.  They live with their daughter in a nice house in American suburbia.  Their lives are all normal...and then it all changes for them.  I can't say much more because one of this movies best features is it twists in the plot and how each character changes throughout the movie.I must warn everyone thought that some of the issues this movie deals with aren't for the timid.  Also, this movie deals with both images and topics that aren't really appropriate for the younger viewing audience.  This is an adult movie--and a very good one at that.  Both Spacey and Bening's preformances are wonderful.  Spacey makes you feel what his character is all about.  Bening's preformance as Carolyn is sometimes overstated and maybe a little overacted.

67879,A37O59DLEGDNTQ,0783239408,SardonicCynic,"[1, 3]","This is one of the truly rare films that works brilliantly on every possible level. As a satire, it delves deep into the heart of society, and illuminates the strong undertones of resentment, despair and desire that  flourish beneath glossy facade of American life. It displays the reasons  why so many lives unfold without any happiness, because people choose to  live without going after their dreams and ambitions. On the other side  &quot;American Beauty&quot; is also a modern tragedy, a story of one man's  search for identity and freedom, and the way he profoundly impacts the  people around him. The film slowly unravels the masks people where, and  explores the moral obscurity and emotional chaos they could plunge into  when they decide of follow their heart instead of their conscience. Kevin  Spacey is phenomenal as Lester Burnham, his performance is 100% worthy of  an Oscar. Alan Ball's script never ceases to amaze me, it's abundance of  shrewd observations and insights is something to marvel at. Visually, the  film is stunning, it's imagery is nothing short of cinematic poetry, you  will find yourself in awe in every frame, every moment. &quot;American  Beauty&quot; never shies away from reality, no matter how sad, and in the  end, you will find yourself looking at the things that surround you with a  whole new outlook.

This film taught me that I shouldn't focus all my attention into just one thing because there is so much beauty in the world that to lock onto just one thing means you block everything else out.  This frame of mind allows you to live life to the fullest by not missing out on the glorious world that surrounds us.

67888,A1L8HRCM60W0W7,0783239408,Shashank Tripathi,"[6, 8]","On the surface, this stunner from Sam Mendes is such a relentlessly bleak look at the vacuity of the supposed &quot;American Dream&quot; that viewers may just turn off to it en masse. And it shows in the acute polarization of reviews here on Amazon.But if you can be a little less knee-jerk and not shut off all rational thought when confronted with what's disturbingly familiar, you may also find that the film is genuinely, voraciously amusing, and directed with such breathtaking flair that Spacey's bravura performance seems like a career-defining one.Beneath the surface of all the seeming pettiness in our daily  idiosynchrasies, the theme points out, is an entire world of such simple elegance that chortles to be seen and heard, but is neither recognized nor heeded to.An interesting visual device in the film is the use of windows. Not just a use, but a splurge, come to think of it. Almost everything important happens in front of, around, or through windows. Could this be a metaphor perhaps for self-examination, for viewing one's life from the outside?What I do not understand is why most films in this genre (Ice Storm, Ordinary People) end with a dramatically tragic finale. Does it take a shattering turn of events to break everyone out of their daily reverie?

The suburbanite, highly dysfunctional, Burnham Family is sad, enchanting, sickening, wonderful, confusing, tragic, abhorrent, and every other adjective listed in Websters.  That is precisely what makes this film a true ""one-of-a-kind"".Mr. Lester Burnham (Kevin Spacey)is daily pitted against his icy, cheating, manic, depressed, totally materialistic realtor of a psudo-wife, Carolyn (Annette Beining) and his quite sullen, self-absorbed, ambivolent, teenaged daughter, Jane (Thora Birch).However, into Lester & Jane's lives come two very achingly beautiful & wonderful human beings. Jane's fellow cheerleader confidant Angela Hayes-note the Nabokov/Lolita reference in the last name-(Mena Suvari) who has a penchant for older men and a huge crush on Jane's daddy, jolts Lester into a sexual epiphany that makes Lester's life worth living again. He daily fantasizes about the young, sexy Angela. She makes him feel like a bumbling, pimplefaced teenager on his first date and all of these meetings between the two really blooms into kind of a second adolescence for the harried Lester. An eerily calm, young next door neighbor, Ricky Fitts (Wes Bentley) and his lifelong Marine Corps father, Col. Frank Fitts, USMC (Chris Cooper) add much drama.The whole cast turns out top-notch performances and the score, cinematography & direction are utterly ""dreamlike"".Highly recommended!Happy Watching!",5,The Best Film I Have Seen In Over 5 Years!,1083801600,"05 6, 2004",2004,1634,"['Writer', 'Alan', 'Ball', 'Six', 'Feet', 'fame', 'first', 'theatrical', 'script', 'blurs', 'stereotypical', 'slow', 'death', 'suburbia', 'lines', 'viewer', 'balance', 'entirety', 'film.This', 'film', 'deeply', 'moving', 'drama', 'suburbanite', 'highly', 'dysfunctional', 'Burnham', 'Family', 'sad', 'enchanting', 'sickening', 'wonderful', 'confusing', 'tragic', 'abhorrent', 'other', 'adjective', 'listed', 'Websters', 'precisely', 'what', 'film', 'true', 'one-of-a-kind', '.Mr', 'Lester', 'Burnham', 'Kevin', 'Spacey', 'daily', 'pitted', 'icy', 'cheating', 'manic', 'depressed', 'totally', 'materialistic', 'realtor', 'psudo-wife', 'Carolyn', 'Annette', 'Beining', 'quite', 'sullen', 'self-absorbed', 'ambivolent', 'teenaged', 'daughter', 'Jane', 'Thora', 'Birch', '.However', 'Lester', 'Jane', 'lives', 'come', 'two', 'very', 'achingly', 'beautiful', 'wonderful', 'human', 'beings', 'Jane', 'fellow', 'cheerleader', 'confidant', 'Angela', 'Hayes-note', 'Nabokov/Lolita', 'reference', 'last', 'name-', 'Mena', 'Suvari', 'who', 'penchant', 'older', 'men', 'huge', 'crush', 'Jane', 'daddy', 'jolts', 'Lester', 'sexual', 'epiphany', 'Lester', 'life', 'living', 'again', 'daily', 'young', 'sexy', 'Angela', 'feel', 'bumbling', 'pimplefaced', 'teenager', 'first', 'date', 'meetings', 'two', 'really', 'blooms', 'kind', 'second', 'adolescence', 'harried', 'Lester', 'eerily', 'calm', 'young', 'next', 'door', 'neighbor', 'Ricky', 'Fitts', 'Wes', 'Bentley', 'lifelong', 'Marine', 'Corps', 'father', 'Col.', 'Frank', 'Fitts', 'USMC', 'Chris', 'Cooper', 'add', 'much', 'drama.The', 'whole', 'cast', 'out', 'top-notch', 'performances', 'score', 'cinematography', 'direction', 'are', 'utterly', 'dreamlike', '.Highly', 'recommended', 'Happy', 'Watching']",Belleza Americana American Beauty  VHS

I'm not sure  if there is a problem in modern society that isn't in this film. It was an  incredibly crafted piece of work, however, to get so many stories within  stories, so many topics and have them all work in a film of less than 2  hours.Every actor from the most insignificant extra all the way to  Spacey and Bening did an outstanding performance. There was no scene that  seemed artificial or staged... everything seemed like reality, as you could  picture it happening. The film is sometimes a comedy, but also a tragedy...  but not just a dark movie w/ a few light moments. Like life, the light and  dark are intertwined into a feast of emotions, sights and sounds.  The film  underscores the fact that life is often stranger than fiction... and while  all of these crazy stories and people intertwine, everyone else's life  always seems more convoluted, bizarre and complicated than our own when  taken out of context.The R rating is not a joke... this is NOT a film  for kids.

Starting off with the hubby masturbating in the shower (yes, just the facts,no embellishments). Some pleasant shots of California suburbs. So what, I can see some trendy suburbs here in Pa., or anywhere else for that matter. Every character is completely useless, except the long suffering daughter, whose father (who does his thing in the shower,this demonstrates his dead end,loveless marriage with an even more shallow money/real estate obsessed wife) is a true smarmy, lying wimp, not above smoking dope with his deranged (but pleasant) teenage neighbor,who turns into a friend of the wimp's long-suffering daughter.And to top it off this frustrated 40 year old suburban white,married (very unhappily) male,with one daughter has an ogling obsession for the Lolita-like cheerleader,foul mouthed friend of said long suffering daughter! There are plenty more generally nasty stereotypes, including the big shot real estate man with whom the said cipher of a wife goes gaga, resulting in the standard voyeuristic hard to watch bedroom scene which is supposed to be funny. And we're supposed to think that blackmailing your pain in the rear boss is funny too! And the strange boy's dad who thinks the aforementioned man, he who does smoke pot with son (not known by son's father) is actually what was once referred to as ""queer"", and may be directing his son in this direction..More misleading,voyeurism which some may find sickening. One or two of the real estate scenes may be funny,even if they're older and more dated than MR BLANDINGS BUILDS HIS DREAM HOUSE from about 50 years ago...The last 15 minutes all of a sudden become a decent thriller too, if you make it this far. And there is a twist at the very end, but this viewer was not surprised in the least...The moral seems to be ""Why don't we just treat everyone with love and kindness,and think about the important things?"" Nice moral,but a very ugly way to say it!! However, this film is timeless in that it is a classic case of a very ugly popular culture at the turn of the millenium! After watching this Academy Award Winner (Best Picture !!), I decided I would pass on the standard self-congratulatory ""Making of this Film"" nonsense.PS...Could anyone ever imagine leading actors (leading men)of yesteryear playing a role here like Spacey's,starting with the shower scene? Imagine Clark Gable, Jimmy Stewart, Cagney, Bogart,H. Fonda, John Wayne,Cary Grant, Burt Lancaster, William Holden, the Marx Bros(!)Jack Lemmon,the Three Stooges(!),Ronald Reagon,Sinatra,Orson Welles, anyone...I Don't think so.

67892,A27M0CNORWZLG1,0783239408,Sheppdawg,"[1, 5]","There are movies and there are films. Today, I will focus on one of the few movies I regard as a true cinematic masterpiece: the film American Beauty.When I was a teenager I had this dream of becoming a movie director. I saw all the popular movies. I watched movies that generally were entertaining and fun. But I knew if I wanted to cut it as a true director I would have to expand my horizons. So I decided to start watching movies that had won Oscars.Enter American Beauty. I watched the Academy Awards in 2000 and saw that film win five of them, including the top ones like Best Picture and Best Actor. I knew I had to see it.But there was a small dilemma: I was fifteen. My parents were very strict about allowing me to view &#34;R&#34; rated movies. After much begging and pleading, my parents granted me permission. My Dad and I went to see American Beauty at the one theater in town that was showing it. Nothing could've prepared me for that day.As I sat in the back row of one of the smaller theater screens, the story began to take shape. Keep in mind that I was only fifteen but while watching this I could feel Lester Burnham's intense self-loathing of what his life had become. He yearned to gain his youth back and become carefree once again. Upon seeing his daughter's friend, Angela, something deep inside him is awoken. He rediscovers something inside of him that doesn't take life too seriously; that doesn't care about the material things; something that can't be defined yet is still in all of us if we truly search for it.He quits his job and blackmails his boss. He buys his childhood dream car. He hits on his daughter's friend. He starts smoking pot. He starts working out. He even gets a job as a fast food burger flipper. Depending on the way you look at it some might construe that as pathetic. In a way it kind of is. But he gains something more important than anything else: true happiness.It's hard to imagine a character such as Lester Burnham becoming anything better or growing as a person. It appears as though he has regressed, not progressed. But by regressing he is progressing, if that makes any sense. I know it sounds paradoxical but that's how he's able to grow in this film.When the film ended and the credits came up, I sat in that theater, in total shock, and watched them. It was the best film I'd ever seen and, to this day, have ever seen.The other supporting characters are just as interesting and make for a great cast. The interaction between Lester and everyone else is both dramatic and comical at times. While everyone has a different interpretation of this film, I think everyone can agree that it has all the elements of a great movie and although it does end in tragedy, it is still a very powerful film that has been my all-time favorite movie since I've viewed it on that Spring day in the year 2000. Although I didn't make it as a movie director (at least not yet), this movie inspired me to do what I always have known is my true passion: filmmaking.This is one you definately have to see. I can't recommend it enough.

67893,A2U0CNW2AKK8AT,0783239408,"""shinhandsomemichael""","[33, 46]","First of all, American Beauty is the best film of 1999. Secondly, Mr. Sam Mendes as its director was so talented in THAT he knew WHAT he wanted the film to come out to be:its directions, its feels and ambience , et al, and  also successfully got the best out of those characters in the film via  sublime performance rendered by the whole bunch of brilliant cast  collectively.The whole story of American Beauty was told from what the  spirit of the dead Lester Burnham ( Kevin Spacey ) had seen through the  last year of his life.In a peaceful suburban neighborhoood where his  house was located in, it all began with the depressed feelings for his  middle-life crisis; the day-by-day gradual distance kept to each other by  him and his once-so-lovely-and-shiny wife, Carolyn Burnham ( Annette Bening  ), whose life-long ambition was to be the most successful and respectable  residential realtor who was willing to sacrifice EVERYTHING in life just to  get there; their ungrateful teen daughter who always blamed on her parents  for ruining her life; his own going-nowhere publication job.....Not only  everyone in his house was revolving around his self but also the other two  households nearby: the gay couple and the retired US marine Colonel Frank  Fitts and his family.Every character in this film more or less  successfully manipulated others' perceptions towards him or her and in  return his or her own perception was successfully manipulated, which the  film was intended to show how powerful and dangerous SUBJECTIVE perception  could negatively affect one' s life.For instance, the image of Angela  Hayes as a chic, fly girl who hated to be perceived as an ordinary, boring  one; Carolyn Burnham who always felt the need to project the image of  success ( Personally, as a former realtor, I really felt for her as if I  were in her shoes in the film ) despite the fact that she was so miserable;  Ricky Fitts who' d successfully convinced his pop that he could afford all  of his latest hi-tech audio-visual systems in his room with his  table-waiting job - Memorable quote: Never underestimate the Power of  Denial....; et al.The film also wisely played with psychological defense  mechanisms like displacement, regression, rationalization, etc.Wrapping  it up, the drama-comedy American Beauty realisticly projects and deals with  the elements of middle-life crisis, hidden depression, black-mailing,  subjective perceptions, shattered dreams and finally the flashback of  Lester's best years of his life just in time of his departure.About the  cast: Kevin Spacey, once again, delivered another of his sublime  performance as usual; Annette Bening, in my humble opinion, deserves an  Oscar-winning tie with Miss Swank of Boys Don' t Cry; Something about the  way Wes Bentley looked in this film for 100 % convinced us that he was not  acting as Ricky Fitts, rather he WAS Ricky Fitts- Too bad that '99 nominee  list of Actor in Supporting Role's traffic are so jammed with great actors  with their deserved nomination; Wittiest screenplay with masterful plot  twistS and heavenly cinematography, to name a few.American Beauty is  definitely a film that is and will always be a part of viewers' sweet  memories and entertaining experience.Shin P.",5,( Look Closer at ) THE RARE BEAUTY,957139200,"05 1, 2000",2000,3261,"['First', 'all', 'American', 'Beauty', 'best', 'film', '1999', 'Secondly', 'Mr.', 'Sam', 'Mendes', 'director', 'was', 'so', 'talented', 'THAT', 'knew', 'WHAT', 'wanted', 'film', 'come', 'out', 'be', 'directions', 'feels', 'ambience', 'et', 'al', 'also', 'successfully', 'got', 'best', 'characters', 'film', 'sublime', 'performance', 'rendered', 'whole', 'bunch', 'brilliant', 'cast', 'collectively.The', 'whole', 'story', 'American', 'Beauty', 'was', 'told', 'what', 'spirit', 'dead', 'Lester', 'Burnham', 'Kevin', 'Spacey', 'had', 'seen', 'last', 'year', 'life.In', 'peaceful', 'suburban', 'neighborhoood', 'where', 'house', 'was', 'located', 'began', 'depressed', 'feelings', 'middle-life', 'crisis', 'day-by-day', 'gradual', 'distance', 'kept', 'other', 'once-so-lovely-and-shiny', 'wife', 'Carolyn', 'Burnham', 'Annette', 'Bening', 'life-long', 'ambition', 'was', 'be', 'most', 'successful', 'respectable', 'residential', 'realtor', 'who', 'was', 'willing', 'sacrifice', 'EVERYTHING', 'life', 'just', 'get', 'there', 'ungrateful', 'teen', 'daughter', 'who', 'always', 'blamed', 'parents', 'ruining', 'life', 'own', 'going-nowhere', 'publication', 'job', 'only', 'everyone', 'house', 'was', 'revolving', 'self', 'also', 'other', 'two', 'households', 'nearby', 'gay', 'couple', 'retired', 'US', 'marine', 'Colonel', 'Frank', 'Fitts', 'family.Every', 'character', 'film', 'more', 'less', 'successfully', 'manipulated', 'others', 'perceptions', 'towards', 'return', 'own', 'perception', 'was', 'successfully', 'manipulated', 'film', 'was', 'intended', 'show', 'how', 'powerful', 'dangerous', 'SUBJECTIVE', 'perception', 'could', 'negatively', 'affect', 'one', 's', 'life.For', 'instance', 'image', 'Angela', 'Hayes', 'chic', 'fly', 'girl', 'who', 'hated', 'be', 'perceived', 'ordinary', 'boring', 'one', 'Carolyn', 'Burnham', 'who', 'always', 'felt', 'need', 'project', 'image', 'success', 'Personally', 'former', 'realtor', 'really', 'felt', 'were', 'shoes', 'film', 'fact', 'was', 'so', 'miserable', 'Ricky', 'Fitts', 'who', 'd', 'successfully', 'convinced', 'pop', 'could', 'afford', 'latest', 'hi-tech', 'audio-visual', 'systems', 'room', 'table-waiting', 'job', 'Memorable', 'quote', 'Never', 'underestimate', 'Power', 'Denial', 'al.The', 'film', 'also', 'wisely', 'played', 'psychological', 'defense', 'mechanisms', 'displacement', 'regression', 'rationalization', 'etc.Wrapping', 'up', 'drama-comedy', 'American', 'Beauty', 'realisticly', 'projects', 'deals', 'elements', 'middle-life', 'crisis', 'hidden', 'depression', 'black-mailing', 'subjective', 'perceptions', 'shattered', 'dreams', 'finally', 'flashback', 'Lester', 'best', 'years', 'life', 'just', 'time', 'departure.About', 'cast', 'Kevin', 'Spacey', 'once', 'again', 'delivered', 'sublime', 'performance', 'usual', 'Annette', 'Bening', 'humble', 'opinion', 'Oscar-winning', 'tie', 'Miss', 'Swank', 'Boys', 'Don', 't', 'Cry', 'Something', 'way', 'Wes', 'Bentley', 'looked', 'film', '100', '%', 'convinced', 'was', 'not', 'acting', 'Ricky', 'Fitts', 'rather', 'WAS', 'Ricky', 'Fitts-', 'Too', 'bad', 'nominee', 'list', 'Actor', 'Supporting', 'Role', 'traffic', 'are', 'so', 'jammed', 'great', 'actors', 'deserved', 'nomination', 'Wittiest', 'screenplay', 'masterful', 'plot', 'twistS', 'heavenly', 'cinematography', 'name', 'few.American', 'Beauty', 'definitely', 'film', 'will', 'always', 'be', 'part', 'viewers', 'sweet', 'memories', 'entertaining', 'experience.Shin', 'P']",Belleza Americana American Beauty  VHS

Each individual character is well developed and interesting.My personal favourite character is Lester, the father of a rebellious teen age daughter and husband to an aggressive, domineering wife.  Lester has successfully pursued his career, built a house and a family and is looking back of the joys of his youth, wistfully wishing for a second shot.  This is not a new character archetype, however, it has been modernized.  The conflicts that Lester experiences are very in tune with those that my peers in their 30-40s experience:  competing with his wife for success, empathizing more with his neighbours drug dealing son than with the neighbours 1950s morality and being overwhelmed by the blantant sexuality of today's teens.I am sure that other viewers could easily identify with characters other than Lester, he just happens to be my favourite.As a DVD purchase, it is an ok bet.  The sound quality is good but not overwhelming and the same can be said for the video.  For a movie this complex, I found the director's commentary interesting and the best reason to buy the DVD.

Every American should own  AMERICAN BEAUTY. This and one other movie I've seen are so brilliant that I  would actually buy the script; it definitely should be made into a  book.Don't take me as a viewer that sees this as the most flawless movie  ever made; because I don't. After taking over 10 pages of notes I found  areas that didn't make sense.  One of the most unrealistic components is  Jane being a cheerleader; she is not the type. So naturally that would  affirm that her friendship with the superficial, self-absorbed Angela would  never have happened. [Come on, we've all been to high school; we know  things just don't work that way.]  Secondly, the &quot;King&quot; of  real-estate having an affair with a competitor in the middle of a highly  publicized divorce in a cheap hotel room also doesn't fit. Thirdly, Ricky's  Dad finding the one brief moment of tape of Lester lifting weights when  Ricky has been filming Jane 90% of the time was extremely unrealistic.  Fourthly, Ricky's Dad confronting Lester in such a manner was totally out  of his military character; nevertheless it was a very effective intense  scene.So then why do you give it 5 stars if you see so many flaws, you  ask?  Because even with the flaws AMERICAN BEAUTY is mesmerizing and  definitely Beautiful. The Beauty supersedes the tiny flaws that I found and  really made me think. The movies that make the viewer think--truly think,  are usually the best movies. Because of this and countless more reasons, I  will buy a copy and keep it in my video collection forever.As Kevin  Spacey, who so deservingly won Best Actor  says at the end: [we the  viewers] &quot;have no idea what I am talking about I'm sure.

67901,A27ZPBY2NSTD63,0783239408,"SockPuppetTheatre ""hammerscholar""","[10, 13]","This is suburban life? How many books do you see in the Burnham household? The mother and the father have absolutely no interest in anything outside their jobs, i can hear people saying 'well isn't that what suburban life is like?' no, it isn't, oh well, Hollywood has misrepresented every other group in society over the years i guess we can't expect them to do any better with the middle classes. The only moment where Spacey's character touches reality is when he bemoans having to miss the James Bond marathon on tv because of his daughter's cheerleading. Come on, the mother listens to South Pacific at the dinner table, we're off in Hollywood lala land...The screenplay is one of the laziest most hackneyed pieces of writing i've ever come across, veering between shallow and predictable teen soap opera and something akin to american pie. The 'at least i'm not ugly' 'yes you are, you're ugly on the inside' moment is as cheap as they come, it even brought a celebratory roar out of the audience and a few springeresque whoops. Also, the screaming of ridiculous things at the point of orgasm is as tired a joke as they come, it got the biggest laugh in the cinema. And of course the [friend] is really a virgin, and when he finds out Lester Burnham decides not to do her right there on the sofa.The film could prbably get away with it if it did just declare itself to be american pie lite, but it doesn't, it makes sure you don't leave the cinema believing it to be anything other than an 'art' film by slowing the pace and holding sterile (but beautifully composed!) images for an eternity. It reminded me a bit of Zabriskie Point in that respect.Irony of this movie is that the shell shocked wife and the homophobic husband next door are more endearing than the central family, that is until he turns out to be an abusive repressed self hating homosexual homocidal nazi fantasist (doh). Can't Alan Ball write an oppressive and domineering father without adding these ridiculous traits? What kind of idiocy is this? I always thought that the mindsets mocked in Woody Allen films were a myth, turns out they exist! They belong to Hollywood writers. Kids, if your father is strict PLEASE take heed of this film, check under his bed for the copy of the protocols of the elders of zion and examine your shower unit because the moment he hits you when he finds out you're involved in drugs he's not far from shooting someone dead. I'm only being as immature as the script.You can argue that the scripts childish exaggerations are necesary to make the film's points hit home (what points?) and create some kind of violent dramatic finale where the protagonist is gunned down (even good american films like Affliction will resort to this, fine, because in that film it is justified) and life affirming realisations and epihanies occur. But really it's an awful lot easier to write such ridiculous characters than actually writing anything genuine and of substance. One can entertain the notion that it is a witty subversion, or a parody of sorts but the truth is its just a very weak piece of self adoring (without any concievable justification) satire with ideas above its station.  it's a smug, facile mediocre comedy that believes itself to be important, its not 'art' (or even very entertaining its so torturously slow and self impressed), it's not anything approaching the 'truth' and it sure isn't a 'wake up call' to any nation.And as for the plastic bag in the breeze... Dude, deep, metaphorical. 'Look Closer', tried, nothing to see here, move along. And they reckon foreign language films are pretentious. The thanking of the plastic bag (apprarently without irony) upon the award of the oscar was truly hilarious. There was gushing, crying and hugging that somehow avoided the mockery that Halle Berry, Gwyneth Paltrow and other embarassing blubberers provoked. Only the 'Life is beautiful' 'director' and his academy award winning performance (and no i am not talking about his acting in the film) have nauseated me more, and to be honest i suspect that was more to do with the film than his live antics. Nice to see quite a few positive reviews of this film on this page resort to abusing (sometimes with name calling! oooh! others with Oscar Wilde) those that didn't find it to be the masterpiece they maintain.And as for the drug dealing teen, i'm sure all of you suburbanites out there knew drug dealers when you were younger, were any of them like this guy? Did they have everything together? Were they competent and business like? Not the ones i knew, they were walking a tightrope most of the time, totally disorganized in all aspects of their life. He's been in a Psychiatric institution for a couple of years and as a result he's totally at ease with himself (?)Really if it weren't for a couple of excellent comic performances this film would be utterly worthless. Mendes next film 'The Road To Perdition' with its reverent self importance, silent gun battles in torrential rain and 'carry on dillinger' second half was pretty awful too, but he's young, handsome and british with a theatrical background who pened his film career with a massive success, so he's a big talent who will be around for a long time doubtless continuing to receive mindboggling comparisons to Orson Welles for as long as his critical stock lasts (hm, apart form anything else i thought Citizen Kane was a box office flop?). Kevin Spacey has since made one of the worst films of its decade 'Ordinary Decent Criminal' and some of us have sat through the excruciating 'Pay it Forward' on vhs, does this guy need a wake up call or what? He's fast dissappearing up his own oscar. But he is critically untouchable it seems, these films didn't even register.And remember...

67904,A3DY46ZABF4CMQ,0783239408,"S. Sarhan ""matured reviewer""","[1, 1]","American Beauty is a spectacular movie directed by Sam Mendes (Jarhead, Road To Perdition), and starring Kevin Spacey (The Usual Suspects), Annette Bening (The Grifters), Chris Cooper (Adaptation), Mena Suvari (American Pie), Peter Gallager (Short Cuts), Thora Birch (Now And Then), and Wes Bentley (Soul Survivors).Spacey plays Lester Burnham, a burnt out middle-aged man who's wife and daughter both think he's a gigantic loser. He knows this and plans to change it all by reliving his younger years before he's killed in less than a year; of course he doesn't know that yet! He meets his daughter's conceited best friend Angela, played by Suvari, and immediately becomes infatuated with her. This begins a period of change for Lester who quits his job, buys the car of his dreams, smokes pot with his young new neighbor and daughter's admirer Ricky Fitts, played by Bentley, and works out to ""look good naked"". His wife Carolyn, played by Bening, on the other hand wants to hit the big time in the real estate world and starts a sexual affair with the real estate king Buddy Kane, played by Gallagher. His daughter Jane, played by Birch,  is an insecure teenager who somehow befriends Angela who is stuck up and, as we find out later in the film, phony. She finds love in neighbor Ricky, whose father Col. Frank Fitts, played by Cooper, is an abusive former military officer.The movie successfully follows each character as the script builds up to the unevitable conclusion with Lester being killed. Director Mendes focuses most on Lester's character, who becomes the hero of the film as he is the only adult in the film who remains loyal and honest, but doesn't neglect the other characters. The best part of American Beauty is watching Kevin Spacey act like an irresponsible young man: smoking pot, benching weights, quitting his job, and fantasizing about Suvari.American Beauty garnered several well deserved Oscars in 2000, including Best Picture, Best Director (Mendes), and Best Actor (Spacey).One of the most memorable movies of the past 10 years!RecommendedA",5,"""Spectacular!""",1143676800,"03 30, 2006",2006,2070,"['American', 'Beauty', 'spectacular', 'movie', 'directed', 'Sam', 'Mendes', 'Jarhead', 'Road', 'Perdition', 'starring', 'Kevin', 'Spacey', 'Usual', 'Suspects', 'Annette', 'Bening', 'Grifters', 'Chris', 'Cooper', 'Adaptation', 'Mena', 'Suvari', 'American', 'Pie', 'Peter', 'Gallager', 'Short', 'Cuts', 'Thora', 'Birch', 'Now', 'Then', 'Wes', 'Bentley', 'Soul', 'Survivors', '.Spacey', 'plays', 'Lester', 'Burnham', 'burnt', 'middle-aged', 'man', 'who', 'wife', 'daughter', 'think', 'gigantic', 'loser', 'change', 'reliving', 'younger', 'years', 'killed', 'less', 'year', 'course', ""n't"", 'know', 'yet', 'daughter', 'conceited', 'best', 'friend', 'Angela', 'played', 'Suvari', 'immediately', 'becomes', 'infatuated', 'period', 'change', 'Lester', 'who', 'job', 'car', 'dreams', 'smokes', 'pot', 'young', 'new', 'neighbor', 'daughter', 'admirer', 'Ricky', 'Fitts', 'played', 'Bentley', 'out', 'look', 'good', 'naked', 'wife', 'Carolyn', 'played', 'Bening', 'other', 'hand', 'hit', 'big', 'time', 'real', 'estate', 'world', 'sexual', 'affair', 'real', 'estate', 'king', 'Buddy', 'Kane', 'played', 'Gallagher', 'daughter', 'Jane', 'played', 'Birch', 'insecure', 'teenager', 'who', 'somehow', 'befriends', 'Angela', 'who', 'stuck', 'up', 'find', 'out', 'later', 'film', 'phony', 'love', 'neighbor', 'Ricky', 'father', 'Col.', 'Frank', 'Fitts', 'played', 'Cooper', 'abusive', 'former', 'military', 'officer.The', 'movie', 'successfully', 'character', 'script', 'unevitable', 'conclusion', 'Lester', 'being', 'killed', 'Director', 'Mendes', 'most', 'Lester', 'character', 'who', 'hero', 'film', 'only', 'adult', 'film', 'who', 'loyal', 'honest', ""n't"", 'neglect', 'other', 'characters', 'best', 'part', 'American', 'Beauty', 'watching', 'Kevin', 'Spacey', 'act', 'irresponsible', 'young', 'man', 'smoking', 'pot', 'benching', 'weights', 'quitting', 'job', 'fantasizing', 'Suvari.American', 'Beauty', 'garnered', 'several', 'well', 'deserved', 'Oscars', '2000', 'including', 'Best', 'Picture', 'Best', 'Director', 'Mendes', 'Best', 'Actor', 'Spacey', '.One', 'most', 'memorable', 'movies', 'past', '10', 'years', 'RecommendedA']",Belleza Americana American Beauty  VHS
67905,A2UW83R0JOZZ6,0783239408,S. Schell,"[25, 31]","Many people have denounced this movie because of its supposedly undeserved praise at the Academy Awards and in part for the ugly rumors that  circulated as to why it garnered so much exultation. I remember reading  that one person was angry because so many beautiful films that were  nominated, containing deep and intriguing subject matter, were snuffed for  a self-absorbed screenplay portraying a dark and perverse white suburbia.  The film is not about this, and is far from any other dismaying assumptions  people might have made. It is about what each of us perceives as beautiful  in our own eyes, be it purely physical or the beauty we find in each other  deep down in the pit of our fragile souls. It is about being thankful for  the priceless gifts bestowed upon us and finding splendor in the simplest  of things in our every day lives. It shows us that image can only take us  so far before the truth about our personal nature must be revealed and the  consequences we suffer when we dishonor that truth.I'll admit that I was  slightly disappointed upon my first viewing of the movie because of its  incomprehensible and climactic ending. However, upon continual viewings, my  interpretation of it began to change, and I realized why its writer chose a  tragic finale. I saw what message it was trying to convey to its every  viewer, and I felt profound sorrow upon realization of the amount of  ignorance in our world, yet I had a sense of hope. Granted, the film  possesses good amounts of acerbic banter and biting humor to avoid being  completely grave, but its overall message behind the mature and sardonic  jokes is all too significant and more optimistic than some seem to think.  The moral I pulled from it is this: Recognize what is important, because in  the blink of an eye, it could be gone. Life is short, rough, but priceless.  Don't go through it with a narrow mind, either. Open your eyes to  everything around you and force yourself to take a deeper look. There's  something beautiful in every single thing we see, no matter how it appears  at first glance. And no, it doesn't matter what kind of person you are, you  can see anything as long as your heart is open to it.Now that I'm  past the fight for artistic recognition, I'll move on to the stellar  performances that this film boasts. Let's start with our main attraction:  Kevin Spacey. Is there anything this man can't do? The first time I ever  saw him was in the eerie portrayal of the sly and sanctimonious serial  killer John Doe in &quot;Seven&quot;, co-starring w/Morgan Freeman and Brad  Pitt. He continued to impress with debonair bits as the smug prosecutor  Rufus Buckley in &quot;A Time To Kill&quot;, and as Jim Williams, the rich  Southern playboy with a dark secret in &quot;Midnight In The Garden Of Good  and Evil&quot;. But compared to the pessimistic and sardonic persona of  Lester Burnham, I've never seen such an entertaining or more realistic  character portrayed. Lester is the epitome of the middle-aged American  male: 40-hour week job at a boring, sanity-consuming marketing firm  involving telephone promotion run by a self-concerned, money-minded CEO.  There is a dark haze over his satisfaction towards his marriage and his  life, the opinions of his wife and daughter laying waste to his crumbling  self-esteem. It is in the moment that he lays eyes upon Angela Hayes' (Mena  Suvari, the perfect ditz) glamorous visage that his ultimate awakening from  his half-dead life begins to blossom like the rose he envisions. Angela  becomes his obsession, and in his obsession he gains a new appreciation for  himself and revives his fleeting youth.Now for Annette Bening - great  airhead! She's the perfect bitch when the situation calls, but aside from  Carolyn's constant henpecking towards Lester, she's an insecure and  melodramatic woman on the brink of insanity. She too suffers from the  maddening simplicity of every day life, seeking her comfort in her social  status and professional success. She eventually pursues her cure in the  odiferous arrogance and professional guidance of real estate mogul Buddy  Kane, a man with equal insecurities who cleverly conceals them behind a  Mentadent smile and pricey designer suits.Watching from the sidelines  with a constant sneer and a quiet, festering hatred for her parents is the  self-loathing Jane (Thora Birch). I remember Thora from films that catered  to a younger generation, notably the portrayal of a young Melanie Griffith  in &quot;Now and Then&quot;, and the endearing Dani in &quot;Hocus  Pocus&quot;. She has grown into a talented woman with the magnificent  performance she gives in this movie as Lester and Carolyn's pessimistic  teenage daughter. She befriends our beloved, self-involved Angela, hanging  among Hayes' pungently supercilious aura with not a care for her own image  until Ricky Fitts (Wes Bentley), her new next-door neighbor, fosters an  innocent obsession towards her. The infatuation soon blossoms into a  delicate romance, deep and meaningful. In their love for each other, you  see the modern cliches of America's definition of beauty melt away into a  more profound look at the human soul and all of life surrounding it.This movie is an excellent character study and a delicate look at what lies  in the human heart. I would like to remind those that didn't really  understand the content and gave it poor reviews because of their  incomprehension that misunderstanding is the most common reason for  disliking. I beg of you to watch this film again with an open mind,  disregarding the somewhat strange anecdotes and scenes that were chosen to  remain in the film, but with good reason. You will begin to see its light,  and I hope it will touch you like a film never has...",5,What Is Beautiful In Our Eyes,966211200,"08 14, 2000",2000,5780,"['Many', 'people', 'have', 'denounced',

67907,A3Q46J5K16CPEQ,0783239408,StaindCatcherintheryeClockworkorange,"[3, 4]","This is one of the most brilliant movies ever made. From the start, when you hear ""Do you want me to kill him for you?"" and then the dreaded ""OK"", the environment is set. Then, there is a pretty suburban neighborhood. No problems, right? Then Kevin Spacey's narration comes on the screen giving insight on everything, and you realise after looking closer (the tagline) that things are not what they appear. Every person in this movie has no formula, they are all so well produced. The writer has created amazing characters. They are all very different except for the fact that they do not understand the concept of how beautiful the world is (american beauty). The movie is about their journey through life and all the obstacles they must go through, and they are still standing, and make the best of everything.With something like this, you would expect a huge soap opera, and crying and screaming every 5 seconds. There are jokes in this movie! This is a light-hearted movie for the most part, which is totally unexpected. This is basically a satire of humans, which is totally original. There are lines like ""Are you trying to look unattractive?"" ""Yes"" ""Well, congratulations. You've succeeded admirably."" That is so much better than saying, say, ""You are so ******* ugly, my god!"" ""Shut up mom! You always complain over and over! I can wear what i want"" ""You are such a bad daughter!"" This movie is so much more artistic than that. There is so much art in this movie, with the roses, and the camera. Everything is perfect. This is the only Best Picture winner of the oscars that i really LOVE.And this movie is not just some depressed guy letting out his insecurities. There is a moral too, which is to appreciate life for what it is, and not what life is not. Ricky helps motivate this moral by showing a video clip of a bag on the street flying with the wind, and saying how beautiful it is. That is genius. No movie would ever in a million years think of something like that. Everybody says Ricky is so weird, but the point is that being ordinary is, for the most part, a bad thing. This movie tells you to be yourself and be original. This is not as negative as everybody else claims it is. Ricky is my favorite character from any movie. Look at this quote:""It was one of those days when it's a minute away from snowing and there's this electricity in the air, you can almost hear it. And this bag was, like, dancing with me. Like a little kid begging me to play with it. For fifteen minutes. And that's the day I knew there was this entire life behind things, and... this incredibly benevolent force, that wanted me to know there was no reason to be afraid, ever. Video's a poor excuse, I know. But it helps me remember... and I need to remember... Sometimes there's so much beauty in the world I feel like I can't take it, like my heart's going to cave in. ""Absolutely beautiful, and completely inspirational. That quote sums up human life, and what humans do not realize. People need to realize that there is more to life than if a pizza is late for delivery, or if the CD you want is out of stock, or if your partner for a tennis team is not a great player. Sometimes you need to just lie back and take the world for what it is, and realize the beauty of the earth.

67909,A27A3AZA7L12N6,0783239408,Stephen M. Bauer,"[2, 6]","Kevin Spacey plays a sexually frustrated, suburban, male head of household who's fed up with his career and chucks it.  His wife is a hypocritical, bitchy career woman with no sexual interest in her husband.  We have the teenage daughter caught in the crossfire and the power struggles. And then there are the wacky neighbors!  Everybody acts out, and there you have the movie!  It should have been named American Tragedy, but Hollywood likes to lighten things up.  They don't like things to get too serious, lest anyone actually learn something.I thought the moviemakers took some typical American issues, like violence, infidelity, and a few others and brought them together.  The moviemakers took the essential drama of these things and made everything else ice-cream parlor suburban.  They didn't show any of the filthy side garbage that actually goes along with this kind of thing in reality.Lester and Carolyn Burnam have a teenage daughter named Jane.  A new family, the Fitts, moves in next door.  Mr. Fitts is a Colonel in the United States Marine Corp.  His son, Ricky Fitts is in high school with Jane.  Colonel Fitts wife, Barbara, is a basket case.  Jane knows about Ricky from the rumor mill.  He used to go to school with them but was sent away to an institution.The movie made me laugh my ass off.  I couldn't take it seriously, like most people did.  Few people that I have spoken too took it as a comedy.  Although the Lester Burnham is hilarious, that's all there is to him.  His phony wife is as superficial as the business suites she wears.  Her method of dealing with a serious emotional issue is to chant slogans learned at a sales seminar at a Holiday Inn.  She (played by Annette Benning) is so empty and absurd you have to laugh at her.  Mother and father had no depth at all.  However, the acting of Kevin Spacey, who played Lester Burnham, was outstanding, a ""10.""  His acting pulled the whole movie to a higher level.  All of the characters were well balanced, although the moviemakers should have spent more time expounding on the character of Thora.  I felt she was essential to understanding the movie.I felt the marine colonel who lived next door was almost real.  The character was obviously created by an insightful, gay screen-writer with a sharp politically-correct ax to grind.  For what little time he spent on screen, the character had showed much more depth than the other two adults.  The only thing I'm skeptical about is that he was so extreme, I'm not even sure if the Marine Corp would put up with him these days.Angela, an aspiring model and girl friend of Jane's is a whole pick-up truck full of insecurities and inside-out values.  You can see plenty of girls like her every day on the daytime talk shows.  She's utterly pathetic.Ricky, the high school kid next door is a sicko of the first order.  Think Colombine High School.  He's become a tremendous financial success selling drugs.  Initially I felt anxiety about the relationship between Lester Burnam and Ricky, but ended up thinking it was healthy for the both of them, except for the drugs, of course.The real characters in the movie were the daughter, Thora, and the kid next door, Ricky.  The daughter had a fair dose of intelligence and common sense and pretty good emotional maturity for a girl of her age.  She was introspective and sized up other people very well, her parents, her girl friend and Ricky.  She knew she needed her parents to be parents.  Psychologically, she was quite robust and healthy.  She will survive and thrive, despite her knucklehead parents.  Ricky, the high school kid next door was real.  He was very intelligent, very talented and had a good personality.  I don't think most viewers realize what a wonderful person he could have grown up to be, had things been otherwise.  In the future, he could have been a successful professional in any field he chose.  I can easily imagine him selling corporations instead of drugs.  The problem was that psychologically, he was damaged beyond repair by his sado-masochistic, homosexual, homophobic father.  Ricky is the real tragedy of the movie.Thora and Ricky symbolize American society, she the healthy part, he the dysfunctional.  And together they go off, hand-in-hand-our future.",4,Provocative tale of life in the suburbs,1026432000,"07 12, 2002",2002,4267,"['Kevin', 'Spacey', 'sexually', 'frustrated', 'suburban', 'male', 'head', 'household', 'who', 'fed', 'up', 'career', 'chucks', 'wife', 'hypocritical', 'bitchy', 'career', 'woman', 'sexual', 'interest', 'husband', 'have', 'teenage', 'daughter', 'caught', 'crossfire', 'power', 'then', 'are', 'wacky', 'neighbors', 'Everybody', 'out', 'there', 'have', 'movie', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'named', 'American', 'Tragedy', 'Hollywood', 'likes', 'lighten', 'things', 'up', 'do', ""n't"", 'like', 'things', 'get', 'too', 'serious', 'lest', 'anyone', 'actually', 'learn', 'something.I', 'thought', 'moviemakers', 'took', 'typical', 'American', 'issues', 'violence', 'infidelity', 'few', 'others', 'brought', 'together', 'moviemakers', 'took', 'essential', 'drama', 'things', 'made', 'everything', 'else', 'ice-cream', 'parlor', 'suburban', 'did', ""n't"", 'show', 'filthy', 'side', 'garbage', 'actually', 'kind', 'thing', 'reality.Lester', 'Carolyn', 'Burnam', 'have', 'teenage', 'daughter', 'named', 'Jane', 'new', 'family', 'Fitts', 'moves', 'next', 'door', 'Mr.', 'Fitts', 'Colonel', 'United', 'States', 'Marine', 'Corp.', 'son', 'Ricky', 'Fitts', 'high', 'school', 'Jane', 'Colonel', 'Fitts', 'wife', 'Barbara', 'basket', 'case', 'Jane', 'Ricky', 'rumor', 'mill', 'used', 'go', 'school', 'was', 'sent', 'away', 'institution.The', 'movie', 'made', 'ass', 'could', ""n't"", 'take', 'seriously', 'most', 'people', 'did', 'Few', 'people', 'have', 'spoken', 'too', 'took', 'comedy', 'Lester', 'Burnham', 'hilarious', 'phony', 'wife', 'as', 'superficial', 'business', 'method', 'dealing', 'serious', 'emotional', 'issue', 'chant', 'slogans', 'learned', 'sales', 'seminar', 'Holiday', 'Inn', 'played', 'Annette', 'Benning', 'so', 'empty', 'absurd', 'have', 'laugh', 'Mother', 'father', 'had', 'depth', 'However', 'acting', 'Kevin', 'Spacey', 'who', 'played', 'Lester', 'Burnham', 'was', 'outstanding', '10', 'acting', 'pulled', 'whole', 'movie', 'higher', 'level', 'characters', 'were', 'well', 'balanced', 'moviemakers', 'should', 'have', 'spent', 'more', 'time', 'expounding', 'character', 'Thora', 'felt', 'was', 'essential', 'understanding', 'movie.I', 'felt', 'marine', 'colonel', 'who', 'lived', 'next', 'door', 'was', 'almost', 'real', 'character', 'was', 'obviously', 'created', 'insightful', 'gay', 'screen-writer', 'sharp', 'politically-correct', 'ax', 'grind', 'what', 'little', 'time', 'spent', 'screen', 'character', 'had', 'showed', 'much', 'more', 'depth', 'other', 'two', 'adults', 'only', 'thing', ""'m"", 'skeptical', 'about', 'was', 'so', 'extreme', ""'m"", 'not', 'even', 'sure', 'Marine', 'Corp', 'would', 'put', 'up', 'days.Angela', 'aspiring', 'model', 'girl', 'friend', 'Jane', 'whole', 'pick-up', 'truck', 'full', 'insecurities', 'inside-out', 'values', 'can', 'see', 'plenty', 'girls', 'day', 'daytime', 'talk', 'shows', 'utterly', 'pathetic.Ricky', 'high', 'school', 'kid', 'next', 'door', 'sicko', 'first', 'order', 'Think', 'Colombine', 'High', 'School', 'become', 'tremendous', 'financial', 'success', 'selling', 'drugs', 'Initially', 'felt', 'anxiety', 'relationship', 'Lester', 'Burnam', 'Ricky', 'ended', 'up', 'thinking', 'was', 'healthy', 'drugs', 'course.The', 'real', 'characters', 'movie', 'were', 'daughter', 'Thora', 'kid', 'next', 'door', 'Ricky', 'daughter', 'had', 'fair', 'dose', 'intelligence', 'common', 'sense', 'pretty', 'good', 'emotional', 'maturity', 'girl', 'age', 'was', 'introspective', 'sized', 'up', 'other', 'people', 'very', 'well', 'parents', 'girl', 'friend', 'Ricky', 'knew', 'needed', 'parents', 'be', 'parents', 'Psychologically', 'was', 'quite', 'robust', 'healthy', 'will', 'survive', 'thrive', 'knucklehead', 'parents', 'Ricky', 'high', 'school', 'kid', 'next', 'door', 'was', 'real', 'was', 'very', 'intelligent', 'very', 'talented', 'had', 'good', 'personality', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'most', 'viewers', 'realize', 'what', 'wonderful', 'person', 'could', 'have', 'grown', 'up', 'be', 'had', 'things', 'been', 'otherwise', 'future', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'successful', 'professional', 'field', 'chose', 'can', 'easily', 'imagine', 'selling', 'corporations', 'instead', 'drugs', 'problem', 'was', 'psychologically', 'was', 'damaged', 'repair', 'sado-masochistic', 'homosexual', 'homophobic', 'father', 'Ricky', 'real', 'tragedy', 'movie.Thora', 'Ricky', 'symbolize', 'American', 'society', 'healthy', 'part', 'dysfunctional', 'together', 'go', 'off', 'hand-in-hand-our', 'future']",Belleza Americana American Beauty  VHS
67910,A3VLYCQV5I2MBW,0783239408,Stephen M. Prescott,"[2, 21]","FOR: As art, American Beauty helps us to re-examine the meaning of our lives by giving us a glimpse of very delicate, important things that reside at the periphery of consiousness.AGAINST: The movie depicts sin without condemning it. Like so many other films of its kind, it depicts family life as full of loneliness and despair.CONCLUSION: Art is inherently subversive. In an era of lawlessness and want, such as the Dark Ages, art attacks what lies at the heart of the savagery of existence in favor of order and hope. In our prosperous era, however, art subverts the institutions of civilization by prying them open and revealing unpleasant, hard truths. A century ago, with the likes of Ibsen and Shaw, one could have honestly supported the hope that we could face the hard truths and that all of it would somehow bear good fruit. Now, amid the moral and social wreckage that surrounds us, only a fool would.Children are precious. Take a child with a character flaw and point out the truth about it to him. Do it over and over and see his spirit die. Families are also good and precious but they can take only so much hard truth. They must have a veneer of fantasy, if you will, to keep going. And while movies such as American Beauty may point out things that are hard to refute, their effect is to discredit good and needed institutions.

From the outside their lives look normal but look closer and you will find things are anything but normal.Kevin Spacey leads an all star cast in the performance that won him an Oscar. He plays a father and husband who is sick of the fake life he's been leading, so he quits his job, begins working out, smoking pot, and most importantly he begins living. This sets a whirlwind of events into action that will leave you breathless and will make you look closer at your own life.What I love about this movie is the honest that is has and power it uses to light up the true world we live in.

67914,A2ARRAMXWT83PT,0783239408,Steven Adam Renkovish,"[0, 5]","This movie is surely one of the year&#8217;s best movies and an instant classic. Never have I seen a movie that tapped into the real, true depiction of suburban life as this movie did.The story revolves around Lester Burnham, a lonely husband and father whose life has slipped away before his eyes. He and his family have not been getting along well, and things are not right. In fact, he is already dead. Yes, the narrator, Lester, is talking to us from beyond the grave.He wakes up every morning, attends his job in advertising, and goes home to his family to have dinner and socialize. This family has slowly fallen apart over the years, and everyone has issues, especially Lester. His wife and daughter both think that he is a loser. His daughter does not want anything to do with him. He is too &#8220;weird&#8221; for her to be around. His wife is a real-estate agent, who is in a high competition with another firm.Like I said before, everyone in this movie has issues. Jane, Lester&#8217;s daughter is your basic, depressed teenager filled to the brims with angst. She feels that she is not attractive, and to not be attractive makes you &#8220;ordinary&#8221;. She has been saving money for ... implants, and is totally determined to change her image.Lester&#8217;s wife, Carolyn, is having problems with her business. She has not sold a home in a long while, and usually goes into deep depression when she does not sell. She also puts out an image of herself. Everything around her has to be perfect. Her whole image is just a front to cover the pain that she is feeling inside. She feels that if the house is not cleaned right or the roses are not trimmed to utter perfection, then she is worthless.  She often listens to self-help cassettes, and starts off everyday with a lip-syncing of &#8220;Don&#8217;t Rain on my Parade&#8221;. She is an emotional wreck from beginning to end.Then, one night at a high school basketball game, Lester catches sight of a beautiful cheerleader, Angela Hayes, Jane&#8217;s best friend. He becomes awestruck as he watches her in amazement, and from there on, she is all that he can think about, and he would do anything to get her. He starts fantasizing about her. Something in him sparks. He realizes that he would do anything to attract her to him.Meanwhile, the new next-door neighbor, Ricky Fitts, has his own problems. His dad is an ex-military officer and is very demanding and beats him often, telling him that he needs &#8220;structure and discipline&#8221;. His mother is clearly not there. Her mind is always in outer space, and she never seems to notice all of the chaos that is going on around her. Ricky films everything around him with his camera. Everything is beautiful to him. He sees beauty in the most abnormal things: a plastic bag, a dead bird, even a dead man.Ricky also benefits in Lester&#8217;s changing attitude. He influences Lester to stand up for himself and take crap from no one. He also introduces Lester to pot. Lester goes to work the next day and blackmails his boss, then quits his job, and applies to work at the local Mr. Smiley&#8217;s fast food restaurant.

67915,A2RHQMV5GD18Z8,0783239408,Steven Aldersley,"[6, 8]","American BeautyDirected by Sam MendesStarring Kevin Spacey, Annette Bening, Chris Cooper, Thora Birch, Wes Bentley, Mena SuvariParamount Pictures | 1999 | 122m | Rated R | Sep 21, 2010Video:MPEG-4 AVC | 1080p | 2.35:1Audio:English: DTS-HD Master Audio 5.1French, Portuguese, Spanish: Dolby Digital 5.1English: Dolby Digital 2.0Subtitles:English, English SDH, French, Portuguese, SpanishDisc:Single 50GB Blu-ray disc, region freeAmerican Beauty won five Oscars: Actor in a leading role (Kevin Spacey), cinematography (Conrad L. Hall), best director (Sam Mendes), screenplay (Alan Ball) and best picture (Bruce Cohen and Dan Jinks). It's a weird tale told in an unusual way.The film contains nudity, violence, bad language, drug use and smoking, so the R-rating is warranted.We learn during the opening narration that our protagonist, Lester Burnham (Spacey), is going to die. The events leading up to his eventual death are funny, moving, sad and unpredictable. Burnham is a pathetic character entering a mid-life crisis and the film shows how his character changes, as well as the lives of the people around him. There is a significant amount of character development in this story. The choice to use Burnham as a narrator was inspired and adds to the feel of the story.It's not strictly a comedy, but it's full of dark humor that is hard to predict. In short, it's the funniest kind of humor. If you found Fargo or any of Quentin Tarantino's films amusing, you'll probably laugh at this too.Burnham changes his life by becoming more assertive and ceasing to care what other people might think. This catalyst for this rebellion is a meeting with his new neighbor, Ricky Fitts (Wes Bentley) who gets high with him before quitting his job on the spot.One of the most important themes of the film is beauty, as you might guess from the title. What is beauty? How do different people define beauty? The contrast between how the characters view other people is startling in places. Some like what they are told to like and dress how they are told to dress. Others are true individuals and express themselves differently. It's interesting to see. You might even find yourself changing your own opinion of what is beautiful as the events unfold.Another theme is the dysfunctional family. The two main families - the Burnham's and Fitts' - couldn't be more different. The one thing they do have in common is that they are living a lie and mostly playing the roles assigned to them by society. They gradually change throughout the movie and try to bring meaning to their lives. we all do this to some extent in our own lives. Why do you do what you do? What do you really want from life and why? Do you set goals in order to get there, or just let things happen? Burnham tries to make things happen.I'm probably in the minority, but I consider this Spacey's best role. American Beauty just makes my Top 10 of all time and it's largely due to his performance. The supporting cast also does good work. His wife (Annette Bening) deals with Burnham's change in her own way while their daughter (Thora Birch) ignores both parents and lives her own life. Chris Cooper has a small but important role as Mr. Fitts.Mendes has taken a look beneath the surface of the American family. It seems that everyone has secrets and chooses to hide them from almost everybody else. The film has humor, sadness, an air of mystery and considerable tension, despite the revelation of Burnham's impending death in the opening narration.Video Quality 3.5/5The Sapphire Series is off to an inconsistent start. While Braveheart was given an exceptional transfer, Gladiator was not so lucky. There was also an audio problem on Saving Private Ryan. The good news is that Paramount offered a free upgrade to fix the problems. Unfortunately, many people will be disappointed with American Beauty on Blu-ray.There's no question that the picture quality is significantly better than that of the DVD. The problem is it's inconsistent. The majority of the film is plagued by frequent white speckles on the image and occasional print damage. Detail is vastly improved, but the images still look a bit drab and subdued due to the source material. Colors look good throughout and red is boosted in some scenes as Mendes intended.The few scenes involving Ricky's camcorder look terrible. I know that it's due to the source material, but the contrast between those scenes and the main movie is huge.Audio Quality 4.5/5The DTS-HD Master Audio track is a big improvement. Ambient sounds such as rain falling are easy to pick out. Thomas Newman's haunting score sounds impressive and adds to the overall mood of the film. Dialogue is always easy to understand and the louder scenes, such as Burnham rocking out while driving, have considerable punch. No complaints at all about the sound presentation.Special Features 3/5Commentary by Sam Mendes and Alan BallAmerican Beauty Look Closer (21:52)Storyboard with Sam Mendes and Conrad L. Hall (1:01:20)Theatrical Trailers (3:00 and 1:22)Similar MoviesAmerican Beauty has a unique feel so it's hard to suggest similar movies. Revolutionary Road, also directed by Mendes, is another movie exploring dysfunctional families and people living a lie. It's not as good though and the characters don't have the same appeal. Strangely enough, I'm also reminded of Wes Anderson's Fantastic Mr. Fox. While it's stop motion, the themes and quirkiness of the story are similar. And finally, check out Magnolia. It's a sprawling study of several different characters and the threads are drawn together expertly by director Paul Thomas Anderson.Overall, I was pleased with the presentation, but the white speckles were too frequent to be overlooked and were a distraction. I'm not sure whether that could be fixed without a full restoration. If you're a fan of the film, buy the Blu-ray and enjoy the enhanced presentation, but temper expectations. There's no guarantee we'll ever see a better version.",5,Kevin Spacey at his best,1303689600,"04 25, 2011",2011,5982,"['American', 'BeautyDirected', 'Sam', 'MendesStarring', 'Kevin', 'Spacey',

All I saw was nihilism (which itself is often mistaken for &quot;art&quot;) and sensationalism.  Of course most people seem to eat that stuff up, though.  I've sat next to people who giggled at the masturbation scenes, and at Bening during her sex scene, and I thought, &quot;Am I missing something?  Is THIS what warrants an academy award these days?&quot;You've got your obligatory good-looking white goth kids, with parents who don't understand them (how original!)...You've got a VERY stereotyped, ridiculously far fetched sub-plot about a &quot;homophope,&quot; who tries to get with the same man whom he thinks is having sex with his son...(sounds like a bad HBO mini series)And then there are the characters, none of which draw any sort of sympathy whatsoever.  How does the father liberate himself from his depression?  By lusting after one teenager, getting high with another, and neglecting his family.  How does the wife liberate herself?  By having an affair.  And the kids?  They talk about murdering their parents.  There are no sophisticated or interesting relationships between characters here...just BAD ones.  All are infantile and selfish.  The point being...?And music?  I love The Who, but apparently you don't have to compose new music for films anymore...This is an MTV generation movie.  It panders to the lowest common denominator with ridiculous sex (like &quot;American Pie&quot; or &quot;Something About Mary&quot;) and &quot;shocking&quot; violence, ala &quot;Boogie Nights.&quot;  Ho-hum.  Then it slips in some &quot;arty&quot; moments with the rose petals and the plastic bag.  But it never asks you to THINK, or to put together information in an intelligent way.

But I was unprepared for the emotional wallop of the characterizations: Kevin Spacey and Annette Bening give two of the most  brilliant performances I've ever seen, as the severely dysfunctional couple  whose marriage is unravelling. The lesser roles are played to perfection:  Thora Birch as their angry and confused daughter; Mena Suvari as her  seductive and self-absorbed girlfriend, for whom Spacey develops a driving  obsession; Wes Bentley as her next door neighbor, who maintains a lucrative  business in illicit drugs to support his obsession with filming everything  around him, including the daughter, who becomes his lover. Chris Cooper  plays the boyfriend's brutal Marine father, oblivious to what is going on  around him. It would be a shame to discuss the plot and spoil its many  unexpected twists and turns, but this film draws you in deeper and deeper  into the growing tension and alienation of Spacey and Bening's marriage, as  the teenagers struggle to find the &quot;beauty in life&quot; that gives  the film its title, and Bentley attempts to capture with his camera. You  may have some trouble accepting the fact that a drug-dealer is the sanest  character in this film, but that's an indication of how severely alienated  the characters are.

Okay so this movie was making a statement about what is wrong with America today, it's supposed to deal with the superficiality of the American suburbs, the hypocrisy of family today, blah blah blah. You get all of that within the first 5 minutes of the movie. The rest of it is all rose petals falling and an excuse pass off nudity as &quot;art&quot;. At no point in this movie was it necessary to for us to see Mena Suvari's breasts. They were totally completely superfluous to the movie. But, hey, this movie is an &quot;artistic masterpiece&quot; so, therefore some nudity is required. Every single scene in this movie was the director screaming from the rooftops: &quot;look at me, I'm making an artistic movie and since many of us aspire to be 'intellectual', i.e. pretentious, we'll praise it because it's 'different' &quot;. What was the point of this movie? Was he trying to get across a message that something is wrong with American society today? If so, he could have done it without Mena Suvari's breasts, the rose petals, and of course the most &quot;beautiful scene in the whole movie&quot; - I refer of course that oh-so-profound scene where the the marijuana-peddling voyeur neighbour says that the plastic bag flowing in the wind was so beautiful. Gosh, that statement had me almost emptying my stomach in the wrong way. Ok, I'll admit that at certain points in the movie, I had to laugh out loud, there was definitely some good humour, but most of this movie, was a useless, senseless, pretentious waste of film. So the director wanted to make the statement that something was wrong with society today. Tell me something I don't know. Look for the beauty in everyday life? Sure, but it wasn't anywhere in the movie. Compare this to another movie which wanted to bring home the tragedy of the twisted world we live in - Life is Beautiful. The director of that movie didn't need to show breasts, didn't even need to use curse words and what little violence there was was implied. Yet it brings home to all of us, how cruel and beautiful and complex human beings are. Another good movie which released around the same time - Fight Club. Also a very brilliantly done movie. The best way to get a social message across is subtlety. This movie was as subtle as sledgehammer. All this movie does is take the worst possible in all of us and put it onscreen. Either way, there was no reason for anybody to see Mena Suvari's breasts. Of course this review will just be voted least helpful, but hey, somebody had to be brave enough to criticize this movie.",1,Even one star is too generous,1005696000,"11 14, 2001",2001,2685,"['course', 'review', 'will', 'be', 'small', 'voice', 'dissent', 'sea', 'praise', ""'m"", 'writing', 'few', 'who', 'will', 'listen', 'Okay', 'movie', 'was', 'making', 'statement', 'what', 'wrong', 'America', 'today', 'supposed', 'deal', 'superficiality', 'American', 'suburbs', 'hypocrisy', 'family', 'today', 'blah', 'blah', 'blah', 'get', 'first', '5', 'minutes', 'movie', 'rest', 'rose', 'petals', 'falling', 'excuse', 'pass', 'off', 'nudity', 'quot', 'quot', 'point', 'movie', 'was', 'necessary', 'see', 'Mena', 'Suvari', 'breasts', 'were', 'totally', 'completely', 'superfluous', 'movie', 'hey', 'movie', 'quot', 'artistic', 'masterpiece', 'quot', 'so', 'therefore', 'nudity', 'required', 'single', 'scene', 'movie', 'was', 'director', 'screaming', 'rooftops', 'quot', 'look', ""'m"", 'making', 'artistic', 'movie', 'many', 'aspire', 'be', ""'intellectual"", 'i.e', 'pretentious', ""'ll"", 'praise', ""'different"", 'quot', 'What', 'was', 'point', 'movie', 'Was', 'trying', 'get', 'message', 'something', 'wrong', 'American', 'society', 'today', 'so', 'could', 'have', 'done', 'Mena', 'Suvari', 'breasts', 'rose', 'petals', 'course', 'most', 'quot', 'beautiful', 'scene', 'whole', 'movie', 'quot', 'refer', 'course', 'oh-so-profound', 'scene', 'where', 'marijuana-peddling', 'voyeur', 'neighbour', 'plastic', 'bag', 'flowing', 'wind', 'was', 'so', 'beautiful', 'Gosh', 'statement', 'had', 'almost', 'emptying', 'stomach', 'wrong', 'way', 'Ok', ""'ll"", 'admit', 'certain', 'points', 'movie', 'had', 'laugh', 'out', 'loud', 'was', 'definitely', 'good', 'humour', 'most', 'movie', 'was', 'useless', 'senseless', 'pretentious', 'waste', 'film', 'director', 'wanted', 'make', 'statement', 'something', 'was', 'wrong', 'society', 'today', 'Tell', 'something', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'Look', 'beauty', 'everyday', 'life', 'Sure', 'was', ""n't"", 'anywhere', 'movie', 'Compare', 'movie', 'wanted', 'bring', 'home', 'tragedy', 'twisted', 'world', 'live', 'Life', 'Beautiful', 'director', 'movie', 'did', ""n't"", 'need', 'show', 'breasts', 'did', ""n't"", 'even', 'need', 'use', 'curse', 'words', 'what', 'little', 'violence', 'was', 'was', 'implied', 'home', 'how', 'cruel', 'beautiful', 'complex', 'human', 'beings', 'are', 'good', 'movie', 'released', 'same', 'time', 'Fight', 'Club', 'Also', 'very', 'brilliantly', 'done', 'movie', 'best', 'way', 'get', 'social', 'message', 'across', 'subtlety', 'movie', 'was', 'as', 'subtle', 'sledgehammer', 'movie', 'take', 'worst', 'possible', 'put', 'way', 'was', 'reason', 'anybody', 'see', 'Mena', 'Suvari', 'breasts', 'course', 'review', 'will', 'just', 'be', 'voted', 'least', 'helpful', 'hey', 'somebody', 'had', 'be', 'brave', 'enough', 'criticize', 'movie']",Belleza Americana American Beauty  VHS
67923,A3OKNJPWDFAGQ7,0783239408,"Teen Critic ""-Luv-""","[5, 7]","-I remember seeing this movie for the first time in grade 5. And believe it or not--the storyline is just as clear now as it was then. Lester is unhappy with his life and makes an effort to change it. A previous reviewer went on about how Lester wasn't a true protagonist. I beg to differ. Lester represents about 95% of the middle aged men in America. He is sexually frustrated, he has an awful relationship with both his wife and kid, plus he wakes up every morning to work a dead end job that makes him unhappy. Other than continuing down this miserable path, he does something about it. He chooses to better himself, and that ultimately makes him a hero. In my opinion, he's the bind that holds the movie together. He uses a very dark, morbid sense of humor that cracks me up every time he's on screen. His actions are justifiable. And also somewhat relatable.-Another thing I like is the movie's incredible use of imagery. American Beauty has some of the best cinematography I've ever seen. The scenery is absolutely breath taking. And it's simple--not too over the top. They didn't have to travel across seas to find amazing landscapes. They just took a contemporary American home and made it both symbolic and beautiful.-The scripting is also right on point. Today's movies have way too much dialogue. But Beauty's characters say more through their actions than they ever could with words--and that's a rare find in recent cinema.-American Beauty is just that. A beautiful film that centers around a dysfunctional American family. It's dark, depressing--yet realistically portrayed.

While married to his beautiful and articulate wife, played beautifully by Annette Bening, he realizes he has strong feelings for his daughter's best-friend Angela, and it is throse feelings that he has to struggle with.

67925,A38U2M9OAEJAXJ,0783239408,The Groove,"[6, 9]","""American Beauty"" is about Lester Berman who is ignored by his wife, despised by his daughter, and is deeply unsatisfied with his job.  Here is a man, so brilliantly portrayed by Kevin Spacey, who so desperately wants to bond and fails at every turn.  His wife, done to the hilt by Annette Benning, is a perky, go-get-em real estate broker who, despite her overachieving personality, is apparently unfulfilled with her marriage and her career.  The only difference between she and Lester is that Lester doesn't hide his feelings and often offends his wife during their regular spats.  Their teenage daughter doesn't seem to care much for either parent, and gets involved with a creepy next-door-neighbor (Wes Bentley) who's being raised by his near comatose mother and tough-as-nails Marine dad.Saying more would spoil it for you, but the movie is an original piece of work that snubs the conventions of modern filmmaking.  Its commentaries on dysfunctional relationships, homophobia, isolation, and stereotypes are so dead-on.  Sam Mendes directs the film with style and craft, and the screenplay is so wittily written.  The DVD is also a solid package.  There's a commentary by the director and screenwriter, as well as a brief documentary, and trailers.

It depicts upper-middle-class suburbia as a paradise lost.

An unhappy man, Lester Burnham (played nicely by Kevin Spacey) trapped in an ordinary and pathetic existence. His equally unhappy wife, Carolyn (played Robotically by Annette Benning), and daughter Jane, feel their own personal pain but can't seem to express their feelings to each other. The set up of the film is brilliant. It's a shame it's follow through isn't. Instead, it goes down a one way course of adolescent, trivial nonesense where Lester tries to find some sort of meaning to life by quiting his job, smoking pot and lusting after his daughter's friend, Angela. Too bad Lester doesn't do something significant and daring, the film isn't set up that way. It's takes cliche's one after another, but works out fairly well. The charm of the film relies on Kevin Spacey's humor, which won't disappoint. But the film also takes a downside when trying to delve into Carolyn's life. She has the cliche affair with another man, which doesn't ever seem to pan out. We're left with a robotic image and characature of an unhappy housewife, not a human being.And then there's the teenage aspect. With Jane, everything seems at odds. But then again, that's what being a teenager is all about. With her new love interest, who can't stop filming stuff, it seems interesting.

67932,A1NSUJJCG73IRF,0783239408,"The Tweeder ""tweeder16""","[2, 3]","Director:  Sam MendesCast:  Kevin Spacey, Annette Bening, Thora Birch, Wes Bentley, Mena Suvari, Chris Cooper, Peter Gallagher, Allison Janney.Running Time: 122 minutesRated R for strong sexuality, language, violence, and drug content.""American Beauty"" portrays the ideal picture of suburbia in the most extraordinary of fashions, utilized by up-and-coming direcor Sam Mendes with glorious execution.  Winner of the 1999 Oscar for Best Picture, ""Beauty"" sends viewers on an emotional rollercoaster that doesn't waver until the final second of the film.  The Burnham family is the ordinary suburban family but in a way the not so ordinary. As the film first starts out, the family lives in suburbia where they are pretending to happy living in a small town and feel right at home (or at least try to).  Lester Burnham (Kevin Spacey in an Oscar-winning performance), our main character who is a 42-year-old man whose middle class, suburban doldrums far exceed the standard middle-age crisis. His fourteen-year career at a magazine publishers is going nowhere, his perfectionist realtor wife, Carolyn (a stupendous outing from Annette Bening), drives him crazy and his angst ridden teenager daughter, Jane (Thora Birch) barely communicates with him, simply writing him off as ""weird."" Things soon begin to change around the Burnham household; however, upon the arrival of several new people who shake things up. While their neighbors on one side are a gay couple, Jim (Scott Bakula) and Jim (Sam Robards), the once vacant house on the other has now been occupied by the Fitts family. Colonel Frank Fitts (Chris Cooper, who was snubbed of an Oscar win for Supporting Actor) is a stern, military man whose wife, Barbara (Allison Janney), seems to be in state of domestic shell shock.Little do they know that their eighteen-year-old son, Ricky (Wes Bentley), a boy so obsessed with life and beauty that they once institutionalized him for two years, is actually a successful drug dealer with a penchant for videotaping everything, including Jane next door.  While that initially creeps her out, Jane soon starts to find Ricky interesting once she gets to know him. That only disgusts Jane's gorgeous cheerleader friend, Angela (Mena Suvari), who thinks Ricky's a pervert although she herself claims she's slept with men just in an attempt to further her aspiring modeling career. When Lester meets both Angela and Ricky, he finds a stirring within himself that he long thought dormant and perhaps dead. With Angela, who openly flirts with him, Lester goes into hormonal overdrive and constantly fantasizes about her, when not pumping iron to get into shape and make himself more attractive to her. With Ricky, Lester finds a kindred spirit whose carefree attitude about life and work -- as well as the expensive pot he sells him -- causes Lester to change his outlook on life. Having successfully blackmailed his former company, Lester sets out to have a good time, not caring that his wife might be seeing local real estate king, Buddy Kane (Peter Gallagher).As everyone reacts to Lester's newfound attitude with shock, he must deal with the fact that Carolyn doesn't like his new self, that Jane half-jokingly asked Ricky to kill him, and that Colonel Fitts becomes suspicious of Lester's involvement with his son.  The irony inherent in this film, and it grows with resonance as the piece draws to a conclusion, is that the only character who truly becomes free must sacrifice everything in order to achieve it. Yet it is through his sacrifice that he is able to afford the surviving characters a glimpse of hope in life.  This film will leave audience's gasping for air: its hyper-realism conveys, at the same time, a portrait of the suburban comedy, a jolting-shock of realization, and a cathartic sense of hope. Mendes depicts a certain people who, to varying degrees, all strive for a certain 'American Dream', yet so few actually attain it. Thomas Newman's riveting, beautiful musical score accompanies the eloquent and demanding characters as they flow through their lives with whistful nature and mystique.  Though whilst one may have difficulty with tagging this film with the 'feel good' label, the beauty of ""American Beauty"" is that it sits half-way between a desperate cry for help and a reassuring sense of happiness and fulfilment and that is cinema at its best.  Simply one of the grandest American films of all time.",5,American Beauty  (1999),1135900800,"12 30, 2005",2005,4429,"['Director', 'Sam', 'MendesCast', 'Kevin', 'Spacey', 'Annette', 'Bening', 'Thora', 'Birch', 'Wes', 'Bentley', 'Mena', 'Suvari', 'Chris', 'Cooper', 'Peter', 'Gallagher', 'Allison', 'Janney.Running', 'Time', '122', 'minutesRated', 'R', 'strong', 'sexuality', 'language', 'violence', 'drug', 'content', 'American', 'Beauty', 'ideal', 'picture', 'suburbia', 'most', 'extraordinary', 'fashions', 'utilized', 'up-and-coming', 'direcor', 'Sam', 'Mendes', 'glorious', 'execution', 'Winner', '1999', 'Oscar', 'Best', 'Picture', 'Beauty', 'viewers', 'emotional', 'rollercoaster', ""n't"", 'waver', 'final', 'second', 'film', 'Burnham', 'family', 'ordinary', 'suburban', 'family', 'way', 'not', 'so', 'ordinary', 'film', 'first', 'out', 'family', 'suburbia', 'where', 'are', 'pretending', 'happy', 'living', 'small', 'town', 'feel', 'right', 'home', 'least', 'try', 'Lester', 'Burnham', 'Kevin', 'Spacey', 'Oscar-winning', 'performance', 'main', 'character', 'who', '42-year-old', 'man', 'middle', 'class', 'suburban', 'doldrums', 'far', 'exceed', 'standard', 'middle-age', 'crisis', 'fourteen-year', 'career', 'magazine', 'publishers', 'going', 'nowhere', 'perfectionist', 'realtor', 'wife', 'Carolyn', 'stupendous', 'outing', 'Annette', 'Bening', 'crazy', 'angst', 'ridden', 'teenager', 'daughter', 'Jane', 'Thora', 'Birch', 'barely', 'simply', 'writing', 'off', 'weird', 'Things', 'soon', 'begin', 'change', 'Burnham', 'household', 'however', 'arrival', 'several', 'new', 'people', 'who', 'shake', 'things', 'up', 'neighbors', 'one', 'side', 'are', 'gay', 'couple', 'Jim', 'Scott', 'Bakula', 'Jim', 'Sam', 'Robards', 'once', 'vacant', 'house', 'other', 'now', 'been', 'occupied', 'Fitts', 'family', 'Colonel', 'Frank', 'Fitts', 'Chris', 'Cooper', 'who', 'was', 'snubbed', 'Oscar', 'win', 'Supporting', 'Actor', 'stern', 'military', 'man', 'wife', 'Barbara', 'Allison', 'Janney', 'be', 'state', 'domestic', 'shell', 'shock.Little', 'do', 'know', 'eighteen-year-old', 'son', 'Ricky', 'Wes', 'Bentley', 'boy', 'so', 'obsessed', 'life', 'beauty', 'once', 'institutionalized', 'two', 'years', 'actually', 'successful', 'drug', 'dealer', 'penchant', 'videotaping', 'everything', 'including', 'Jane', 'next', 'door', 'initially', 'out', 'Jane', 'soon', 'find', 'Ricky', 'interesting', 'once', 'know', 'only', 'Jane', 'gorgeous', 'cheerleader', 'friend', 'Angela', 'Mena', 'Suvari', 'who', 'Ricky', 'pervert', 'slept', 'men', 'just', 'attempt', 'further', 'aspiring', 'modeling', 'career', 'When', 'Lester', 'Angela', 'Ricky', 'stirring', 'long', 'thought', 'dormant', 'perhaps', 'dead', 'Angela', 'who', 'openly', 'Lester', 'hormonal', 'overdrive', 'constantly', 'when', 'not', 'pumping', 'iron', 'get', 'shape', 'make', 'more', 'attractive', 'Ricky', 'Lester', 'kindred', 'spirit', 'carefree', 'attitude', 'life', 'work', 'as', 'well', 'expensive', 'pot', 'Lester', 'change', 'outlook', 'life', 'Having', 'successfully', 'blackmailed', 'former', 'company', 'Lester', 'out', 'have', 'good', 'time', 'not', 'caring', 'wife', 'might', 'be', 'seeing', 'local', 'real', 'estate', 'king', 'Buddy', 'Kane', 'Peter', 'Gallagher', '.As', 'everyone', 'reacts', 'Lester', 'newfound', 'attitude', 'shock', 'must', 'deal', 'fact', 'Carolyn', ""n't"", 'like', 'new', 'self', 'Jane', 'half-jokingly', 'asked', 'Ricky', 'kill', 'Colonel', 'Fitts', 'suspicious', 'Lester', 'involvement', 'son', 'irony', 'inherent', 'film', 'resonance', 'piece', 'conclusion', 'only', 'character', 'who', 'truly', 'free', 'must', 'sacrifice', 'everything', 'order', 'achieve', 'sacrifice', 'able', 'afford', 'surviving', 'characters', 'glimpse', 'hope', 'life', 'film', 'will', 'leave', 'audience', 'gasping', 'air', 'hyper-realism', 'conveys', 'same', 'time', 'portrait', 'suburban', 'comedy', 'jolting-shock', 'realization', 'cathartic', 'sense', 'hope', 'Mendes', 'certain', 'people', 'who', 'varying', 'degrees', 'strive', 'certain', ""'American"", 'Dream', 'yet', 'so', 'few', 'actually', 'attain', 'Thomas', 'Newman', 'riveting', 'beautiful', 'musical', 'score', 'eloquent', 'demanding', 'characters', 'flow', 'lives', 'whistful', 'nature', 'mystique', 'whilst', 'one', 'may', 'have', 'difficulty', 'tagging', 'film', ""'feel"", 'good', 'label', 'beauty', 'American', 'Beauty', 'half-way', 'desperate', 'cry', 'help', 'reassuring', 'sense', 'happiness', 'fulfilment', 'cinema', 'best', 'Simply', 'one', 'grandest', 'American', 'films', 'time']",Belleza Americana American Beauty  VHS

You can  watch it and realize what a great movie this has become.  Upon viewing the  trailer to the movie, I thought it would be just a sexy raunchy film with  just some special effect (the flower petals) and a bland storyline.  However, upon viewing the actual movie, I was shocked and blown away at  just how good this movie is.  An cast that really brings the movie to life  and a plot that will have some thinking and others offended.  The movie is  more than just what most think, it's really about the hidden beauty within  the world, within ourselves and within our minds.  But don't let that fool  you, the movie is funny all the same, but smart funny, not fart fart funny.  Probably the best feature about the movie is Kevin Spacey and his role as  a man simply wanting the younger beauty the world has to offer, but this  has gotten many offended, but it's very interesting as to how he deals with  it, it's also hilarious.

And don't be shocked or ticked, because the first sentence of the first narration states that he will die, and this story is why.The reason for the 5 star treatment: 1: It kept my attention and interest the entire film. 2: The excellent performances by Kevin Spacey and the other actors and actresses. 3: The comic relief that relaxes some of the tension that builds toward the end of the film. 4: The plastic bag, THAT WAS COOL, I love photography and art, and that was talented and took hard work Im sure (In case your wondering that video was A REAL LIFE video filmed by the Director. 5: The clever ways they threw in the words LOOK CLOSER throughout the film.

Smith ""BigT""","[4, 8]","American Beauty is the greatest movie ever made.If you haven't already, watch American Beauty by yourself and give yourself some time afterwards to think it over. You will never, ever look at life the same way. It does exactly what movies are meant to do - give us a window into ourselves, and American Beauty does that better than any other film has ever done. No word of dialogue is unnecessary, no character exaggerated, everything is perfect...but if you have seen American Beauty you should know that already. Once you look closer at this movie, and see Beauty in every frame, it becomes so much easier to look closer and see Beauty in everything around you. You think I'm waxing poetic? Then you must not have seen the movie. Every character is a part of each of us: the Lester Burnham of change, the Carolyn of uncertainty and failure, the rebellion of Jane, the defeated Barbara, the false control of Angela and the Colonel, and the real control of Ricky. To me Ricky, not Lester, is the center of this story; he somehow controls or sets in motion the heart of Lester's rebirth and downfall. There are several parts of this movie where I lose control every time I see it, and none more so than the paper bag scene. To me that scene is simply the greatest monologue ever written.I listened to the message of American Beauty - look closely and you can find Beauty in anything - and it changed my life. I rose out of a long, deep depression and started out into the world. Sometimes there is so much Beauty in the world, I can't even stand it, and it feels like my heart is going to burst.This is the most beautiful movie I have ever seen.",5,Fantastic,1182470400,"06 22, 2007",2007,1644,"['American', 'Beauty', 'greatest', 'movie', 'ever', 'made.If', 'have', ""n't"", 'already', 'watch', 'American', 'Beauty', 'give', 'time', 'afterwards', 'think', 'over', 'will', 'never', 'ever', 'look', 'life', 'same', 'way', 'exactly', 'what', 'movies', 'are', 'meant', 'do', 'give', 'window', 'ourselves', 'American', 'Beauty', 'better', 'other', 'film', 'ever', 'done', 'word', 'dialogue', 'unnecessary', 'character', 'exaggerated', 'everything', 'perfect', 'have', 'seen', 'American', 'Beauty', 'should', 'know', 'already', 'look', 'closer', 'movie', 'see', 'Beauty', 'frame', 'so', 'much', 'easier', 'look', 'closer', 'see', 'Beauty', 'everything', 'think', ""'m"", 'waxing', 'poetic', 'Then', 'must', 'not', 'have', 'seen', 'movie', 'character', 'part', 'Lester', 'Burnham', 'change', 'Carolyn', 'uncertainty', 'failure', 'rebellion', 'Jane', 'defeated', 'Barbara', 'false', 'control', 'Angela', 'Colonel', 'real', 'control', 'Ricky', 'Ricky', 'not', 'Lester', 'center', 'story', 'controls', 'sets', 'motion', 'heart', 'Lester', 'rebirth', 'downfall', 'are', 'several', 'parts', 'movie', 'where', 'lose', 'control', 'time', 'see', 'none', 'more', 'so', 'paper', 'bag', 'scene', 'scene', 'simply', 'greatest', 'monologue', 'ever', 'written.I', 'listened', 'message', 'American', 'Beauty', 'look', 'closely', 'can', 'find', 'Beauty', 'anything', 'changed', 'life', 'rose', 'long', 'deep', 'depression', 'started', 'out', 'world', 'so', 'much', 'Beauty', 'world', 'ca', ""n't"", 'even', 'stand', 'heart', 'going', 'burst.This', 'most', 'beautiful', 'movie', 'have', 'ever', 'seen']",Belleza Americana American Beauty  VHS

A civilization that does not come out so nicely from this portrayal.An example of this would be one of the movie's strongest parts when Annette Bening obsessingly scrubs the house she intends to sell, telling herself ""I will sell this house today"" over and  over again as a mantra and then breaking apart at the end of the day.. Crying and slapping her face for crying... What I mean is that I judge this behavior to be very American in the sense that Americans are great believers of the self power to change one's self and the reality surrounding him, and yet, this scene can also be viewed as a cosmopolite statement about loneliness - the fact that by the end of the day all you have is yourself only, and the ways people find to make themselves miserable.... all on their struggle to what they see as happiness (money? .... Success?)I loved Kevin Spacey in this movie. I think his character is what gives this movie its charm. This could have been a totally depressing movie and is a little less so as his character somehow manages to give some comic relief - to be funny and heartbreaking at the same time. Lester has something about him that totally appeals to all of us - the courage to throw everything away - sort of achieving every one secret wish. He manages to be a total loser and a hero at the same time. This character is so human - and such a contrast to the phony uptight wife. I found the scene where he reaches out for her to be very touching... however she is more interested in the sofa.And yet, life can be beautiful and this too comes out from the movie. There can be so many good things and Lester does not need to work in a ""real"" job to be happy. The other characters seem all to be in a search of happiness -  Ricki can see beauty only through his camera so it seems and when he is behind the camera he can become one with nature and with his surrounding. There is so much contrast between his ""art"" - and the beauty he can find in filming a plastic bag moving in the wind and the kind of life he leads, full of lies and deceit. He has found his way of ""surviving"" and in a way so did the other characters. The problem starts when these survival methods are shattered such as with Angela, Jane's friend, or when Carolyn's pretenses and fake up world is exposed. Lester is the only one who did not have pretenses (he had one secret re Angela but I feel that at least towards himself he did not lie about it) and thus I see him as a tragic hero. He did not ""pretend"" or lie, and yet paid the price for the others dishonesties.",5,Beautiful.,1054598400,"06 3, 2003",2003,2831,"['thoughts', 'whilst', 'viewing', 'superb', 'film', 'stem', 'fact', 'being', 'culture', 'judge', 'many', 'things', 'movie', 'be', 'so', 'typically', 'American', 'yet', 'admit', 'American', 'life', 'only', 'symbol', 'modern', 'life', 'western', 'civilization', 'civilization', 'not', 'come', 'out', 'so', 'nicely', 'portrayal.An', 'example', 'would', 'be', 'one', 'movie', 'strongest', 'parts', 'when', 'Annette', 'Bening', 'obsessingly', 'scrubs', 'house', 'sell', 'telling', 'will', 'sell', 'house', 'today', 'over', 'again', 'mantra', 'then', 'breaking', 'apart', 'end', 'day..', 'Crying', 'slapping', 'face', 'crying', 'What', 'mean', 'judge', 'behavior', 'be', 'very', 'American', 'sense', 'Americans', 'are', 'great', 'believers', 'self', 'power', 'change', 'one', 'self', 'reality', 'surrounding', 'yet', 'scene', 'can', 'also', 'be', 'viewed', 'cosmopolite', 'statement', 'loneliness', 'fact', 'end', 'day', 'have', 'only', 'ways', 'people', 'find', 'make', 'miserable', 'struggle', 'what', 'see', 'happiness', 'money', 'Success', 'loved', 'Kevin', 'Spacey', 'movie', 'think', 'character', 'what', 'movie', 'charm', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'totally', 'depressing', 'movie', 'little', 'less', 'so', 'character', 'somehow', 'give', 'comic', 'relief', 'be', 'funny', 'heartbreaking', 'same', 'time', 'Lester', 'something', 'totally', 'appeals', 'courage', 'throw', 'everything', 'away', 'sort', 'achieving', 'one', 'secret', 'wish', 'be', 'total', 'loser', 'hero', 'same', 'time', 'character', 'so', 'human', 'contrast', 'phony', 'uptight', 'wife', 'found', 'scene', 'where', 'out', 'be', 'very', 'touching', 'however', 'more', 'interested', 'sofa.And', 'yet', 'life', 'can', 'be', 'beautiful', 'too', 'out', 'movie', 'can', 'be', 'so', 'many', 'good', 'things', 'Lester', 'not', 'need', 'work', 'real', 'job', 'be', 'happy', 'other', 'characters', 'seem', 'be', 'search', 'happiness', 'Ricki', 'can', 'see', 'beauty', 'only', 'camera', 'when', 'camera', 'can', 'become', 'one', 'nature', 'surrounding', 'so', 'much', 'contrast', 'art', 'beauty', 'can', 'find', 'filming', 'plastic', 'bag', 'moving', 'wind', 'kind', 'life', 'full', 'lies', 'deceit', 'found', 'way', 'surviving', 'way', 'so', 'did', 'other', 'characters', 'problem', 'when', 'survival', 'methods', 'are', 'shattered', 'such', 'Angela', 'Jane', 'friend', 'when', 'Carolyn', 'pretenses', 'fake', 'up', 'world', 'exposed', 'Lester', 'only', 'one', 'who', 'did', 'not', 'have', 'pretenses', 'had', 'one', 'secret', 're', 'Angela', 'feel', 'least', 'towards', 'did', 'not', 'lie', 'thus', 'see', 'tragic', 'hero', 'did', 'not', 'pretend', 'lie', 'yet', 'paid', 'price', 'others', 'dishonesties']",Belleza Americana American Beauty  VHS

If American Beauty had just been  a comedy, it could have been great, but it has an awkward tone that ruins  everything.  Another flaw is that it isn't nearly as shocking as the  filmmakers would like to think it is.  It is like if Todd Solondz's  Happiness was sanitized and watered down for mass consumption, removing  anything interesting or thought provoking.

It's also a tragedy that this film was incredibly overrated by its viewers.  What does it say?  That so many people can &quot;relate&quot; to the desperate and pathetic characters of this suburbian hell-reality?I thought some of the themes in this film were worthy of presentation.  How ridiculous society (not just middle-America) has become with its over-indulgence of material goods, loss of immaterial and spiritual wealth and wholeness, lack of closeness within the family unit, complete voidness of morals of values...it certainly is a shame!  But the danger of the message in the film is its existential ending, its answer being utter hopelessness and helplessness.  Please.  There are solutions to all of these problems, but unfortunately, neither the makers of the film nor the fans realize this even though they continually ask us to &quot;look closer.&quot;There is some unrealism that should be pointed out in the characters.  I didn't buy the whole &quot;closeted-homophobic military man&quot; character.  I'm not denying that such contradictions in human character exist, however, the film portrayed the character as someone who was mainly concerned with his son, not personal egocentric struggles.  I interpreted Cooper's character's final actions to be purely empathetic and wrathful.  When he kissed Lester Burnham, it was to empathize with his son whom he thought was engaging in homosexual activities with Spacey's character.  When he killed Burnham, it wasn't out of rejection of his homosexual pass, but out of anger for the prostitution of his son.Certainly, the movie deserves some praise for its content, although it is not as original as people claim.  If I am not mistaken, &quot;Ice Storm&quot; incoporated similar themes, and in some ways, was a more successful film in representing society's moral grayness.  I thoroughly enjoyed Kevin Spacey's sarcastic, hedonistic character, (though I do not think it was Spacey's best performance as some have stated.  The deception he created in The Usual Suspects and mystery he upheld in Seven were, in my opinion, more oustanding, substantial, and challenging than his role in American Beauty will ever be) and did empathize with him in the end.It is not surprising that this was a directional debut, as the director overwhelms the audience with its directed narration, leaving no intuitive challenge for the deeper viewer.  I personally desire movies that carry more subtle themes, challenging the audience to understand the meaning of the piece.  With American Beauty, the messages are so naked and apparent that it only encourages brainlessness viewing.Overall, an average movie challenging deep themes.

67952,A1H5E7O5BW2J13,0783239408,V.C.,"[1, 2]","It definitely deserved its award for Best Picture. I've never seen a film that portrayed the ""all-American dream"" suburbean family with such intelligence, hope, honesty, tragedy, and dark humor. This movie doesn't at all sugarcoat any of the characters; instead, the characters sugarcoat themselves. And most brilliant of all, they don't lead us to predictable territory. Just when you think of the typical thing that usually happens, or could have happened, to these characters, things turn around, surprising us with a whole different outcome and consequence. Kevin Spacey's calm narration itself was a chilling contrast to not only the seemingly beautiful and peaceful neighborhood that his character Lester lived, but also to the melancholy and tragic outcome of his life and that of his family and his neighbors. Also, an awesome performance by Allison Janney. Mena Suvari, who played Angela, the sly and sexually obsessed cheerleading teenager that Lester falls for (thus beginning his fantasies for her, such as the memorable roses in the bathtub scene), also did a great job. However, I felt that she made it too obvious that she, too, wanted to seduce Lester. I believe it would have been more affective if she was portrayed as an innocent girl in person, but then naughty in Lester's fantasy world. The fact that she would have had kicks out of seducing Lester to begin with didn't make the fantasy scenes very, well, make-believe.

The rush of emotions one feels when watching Lester Burnham (played to absolute perfection by Kevin Spacey) wander through his life like a suburban zombie is simply devastating. The film was directed by Sam Mendes is such a serene, crystal-clear and precise manner, I can't help but be reminded of the late, great Stanley Kubrick who had a way of making even the most disturbing ideas seem appealing with his use of slow rhythms, dramatic pauses and glaring white light. Annette Bening's Caroline is the perfect shrew, but that tough exterior merely masks her insecurities (witness her brilliant emotional breakdown alone in the den of horrible house she fails to sale. Slapping herself and screaming &quot;shut up you baby&quot; before slipping back into her role as the domineering control freak is fascinating!) The lucious Thora Birch also turns what could have been a one-note character (Janie) into a tour-de-force of of teen angst and isolation. When she finally succumbs to the charms of the quiet,curious and supremely secure boy next door Ricky Fitts (the superb and commanding Wes Bently) the kiss they share is the most tender and affectionate moment in the entire film. Ricky's speech about all the beauty in the world and the way it fills you up is also a classic. This film fills me up and satisfies on so many levels it's difficult to convey in a mere thousand words.

67968,A1COQ2DOO1O9HD,0783239408,Wing J. Flanagan,"[10, 17]","Pitch-perfect dialogue, amazing performances, solid direction, glowing cinematography - American Beauty has all of these things.  Yet the whole is less than the sum of its parts. It aspires to European complexity while paradoxically wallowing in American sensationalism.  It tries to paint a subtle moral landscape with a gallon of latex semi-gloss and a roller, with lurid supporting characters that could have come from Ricki Lake's green room.By now everyone knows that the story centers on Lester Burnham (Kevin Spacey), whose life has become an empty, materialistic nightmare with his disrespectful daughter and frigid wife (Annette Benning).  He changes things - a bit too drastically - and ends up becoming a blackmailer, a drug user, and a would-be pedophile.  That he changes his mind at the last minute and doesn't have sex with the teenaged girl, that he ends up martyred because the next-door neighbor thinks (through a bizarre misunderstanding) that he's been taking sexual advantage of his son, that he has some New-Aged revelation about the Circle of Life as he's dying...well, all that's supposed to make him OK.If American Beauty had committed to making Lester either a villain or a hero, it might have worked better.  Instead, it asks us to see him as a flawed, complex man - and forgive him.  That might been possible, had this loopy, creaky, arbitrary series of plot devices not been employed in place of a real story.For every theme explored in American Beauty, better films exist.  Either film version of Lolita, for example, develops the theme of middle-aged crisis coupled with pedophilia far more logically and empathetically, and without resorting to an unconvincing, last minute change of heart to &quot;redeem&quot; the main character.",2,Brilliant performances; trite story,988848000,"05 3, 2001",2001,1763,"['Pitch-perfect', 'dialogue', 'amazing', 'performances', 'solid', 'direction', 'glowing', 'cinematography', 'American', 'Beauty', 'things', 'whole', 'less', 'sum', 'parts', 'European', 'complexity', 'paradoxically', 'wallowing', 'American', 'sensationalism', 'paint', 'subtle', 'moral', 'landscape', 'gallon', 'latex', 'semi-gloss', 'roller', 'lurid', 'supporting', 'characters', 'could', 'have', 'come', 'Ricki', 'Lake', 'green', 'room.By', 'now', 'everyone', 'story', 'centers', 'Lester', 'Burnham', 'Kevin', 'Spacey', 'life', 'become', 'empty', 'materialistic', 'nightmare', 'disrespectful', 'daughter', 'frigid', 'wife', 'Annette', 'Benning', 'things', 'bit', 'too', 'drastically', 'up', 'becoming', 'blackmailer', 'drug', 'user', 'would-be', 'pedophile', 'mind', 'last', 'minute', ""n't"", 'have', 'sex', 'teenaged', 'girl', 'up', 'martyred', 'next-door', 'neighbor', 'thinks', 'bizarre', 'misunderstanding', 'been', 'taking', 'sexual', 'advantage', 'son', 'New-Aged', 'revelation', 'Circle', 'Life', 'dying', 'well', 'supposed', 'make', 'OK.If', 'American', 'Beauty', 'had', 'committed', 'making', 'Lester', 'villain', 'hero', 'might', 'have', 'worked', 'better', 'Instead', 'see', 'flawed', 'complex', 'man', 'forgive', 'might', 'been', 'possible', 'had', 'loopy', 'creaky', 'arbitrary', 'series', 'plot', 'devices', 'not', 'been', 'employed', 'place', 'real', 'story.For', 'theme', 'explored', 'American', 'Beauty', 'better', 'films', 'exist', 'film', 'version', 'Lolita', 'example', 'theme', 'middle-aged', 'crisis', 'coupled', 'pedophilia', 'far', 'more', 'logically', 'empathetically', 'resorting', 'unconvincing', 'last', 'minute', 'change', 'heart', 'quot', 'redeem', 'quot', 'main', 'character']",Belleza Americana American Beauty  VHS

It was overly loved at the time it came out, so I believe there will be a certain amount of the opposite later. And this is  truly undeserved. While it may not be the greatest film of '99 (which the  awards suggest) in practically any other year from the last 10 I would  rarely have agrued. My own personal problem is that while American Beauty  is a great film, it's nothing compared to some of the films from last year.  Now, I love this film. It's the kind of thing Hollywood never does enough.  It is a damn fine film. Spacey is great, Bening has never been better (but  is that so hard?) and Sam Mendes reminds everyone why we should let more  Brits make movies. We've just got far more subtlety and intelligence than  your usual Hollywood director. The script is great, filled with wonderful  dialogue and some great charcters. In fact, I can hardly say anything bad  about his movie. The only thing is that maybe, just maybe, the guy next  door isn't quite a strong enough character.

They must really hate it when an almost genre-less film like this comes along and they simply do not know how to classify it or what to write up as the advertising blurb.I was expecting a tale of a teenage femme fetale and her effects on an depressed aging middle-aged male, but also was expecting a sniggering ""black comedy"" as the back of the box had told me.I got neither, but what I did get was the most engaging and intelligent film I have seen for a long while. I do have some sympathies with the advertising men as the film is pretty had to classify. It's not a black comedy and yet there are some genuinely amusing scenes. It's not a tale of a middle class American family and yet it almost solely features the Burnham family and those close to them. I guess the best I can do to describe it is call it a modern day saga of the breakdown of relationships.Every single one of the characters shown has some sort of problem with the way their lives are developing, (apart from the smiley happy gay couple next door.) Lester Burnham is the classic 40 something miserable burned out executive. His wife doesn't love or care for him anymore, she is only concerned that he doesn't embarrass her. His daughter doesn't talk to him anymore and has confessed to her boyfriend she would like him dead. Lester for his own part undermines and belittles his wife at every opportunity, he unashamedly lusts after his daughter's school friend and ridicules and alienates his bosses until they are forced to fire him. Their neighbours, the Fitts, include ex-marine Col Frank Fitts, a stoic military type who forces his son into giving urine samples to test for drug abuse. The son, Ricky, a camera fanatic has taken to filming the local goings on including some dubious footage of the Burnham family. There are plenty more besides this motley selection and it is the quirks and oddities of the characters that makes the film what it is, but at the same time the oddities are ones that we can relate to and maybe even rather scarily see in ourselves. Again for nearly all the characters we can find traits we despise and yet because of failings in other areas we feel sympathy for them at the same time.The performances are to a man extremely accomplished and well executed. Kevin Spacey won a deserved Oscar for his portrayal of Lester Burnham and Annette Bening was also nominated. Their performances and those of the other actors are all played with delicacy, humanity and a great deal of believability.Well recommended and a must see for any fans of the cinema.",5,A Beautiful American Film,1151107200,"06 24, 2006",2006,2730,"['American', 'Beauty', 'modern', 'day', 'film', 'fallen', 'foul', 'narrow-minded', 'vision', 'marketing', 'men', 'responsible', 'film', 'trailers', 'must', 'really', 'hate', 'when', 'almost', 'genre-less', 'film', 'along', 'simply', 'do', 'not', 'know', 'how', 'classify', 'what', 'write', 'up', 'advertising', 'blurb.I', 'was', 'expecting', 'tale', 'teenage', 'femme', 'fetale', 'effects', 'depressed', 'aging', 'middle-aged', 'male', 'also', 'was', 'expecting', 'sniggering', 'black', 'comedy', 'back', 'box', 'had', 'told', 'me.I', 'got', 'neither', 'what', 'did', 'get', 'was', 'most', 'engaging', 'intelligent', 'film', 'have', 'seen', 'long', 'while', 'do', 'have', 'sympathies', 'advertising', 'men', 'film', 'pretty', 'had', 'classify', 'not', 'black', 'comedy', 'yet', 'are', 'genuinely', 'amusing', 'scenes', 'not', 'tale', 'middle', 'class', 'American', 'family', 'yet', 'almost', 'solely', 'Burnham', 'family', 'close', 'guess', 'best', 'can', 'do', 'describe', 'call', 'modern', 'day', 'saga', 'breakdown', 'relationships.Every', 'single', 'one', 'characters', 'shown', 'sort', 'problem', 'way', 'lives', 'are', 'developing', 'apart', 'smiley', 'happy', 'gay', 'couple', 'next', 'door', 'Lester', 'Burnham', 'classic', '40', 'something', 'miserable', 'burned', 'out', 'executive', 'wife', ""n't"", 'love', 'care', 'anymore', 'only', 'concerned', ""n't"", 'embarrass', 'daughter', ""n't"", 'talk', 'anymore', 'confessed', 'boyfriend', 'would', 'like', 'dead', 'Lester', 'own', 'part', 'undermines', 'wife', 'opportunity', 'unashamedly', 'daughter', 'school', 'friend', 'ridicules', 'bosses', 'are', 'forced', 'fire', 'neighbours', 'Fitts', 'include', 'ex-marine', 'Col', 'Frank', 'Fitts', 'stoic', 'military', 'type', 'who', 'son', 'giving', 'urine', 'samples', 'test', 'drug', 'abuse', 'son', 'Ricky', 'camera', 'fanatic', 'taken', 'filming', 'local', 'goings', 'including', 'dubious', 'footage', 'Burnham', 'family', 'are', 'plenty', 'more', 'motley', 'selection', 'quirks', 'oddities', 'characters', 'film', 'what', 'same', 'time', 'oddities', 'are', 'ones', 'can', 'relate', 'maybe', 'even', 'rather', 'scarily', 'see', 'Again', 'nearly', 'characters', 'can', 'find', 'traits', 'despise', 'yet', 'failings', 'other', 'areas', 'feel', 'sympathy', 'same', 'time.The', 'performances', 'are', 'man', 'extremely', 'accomplished', 'well', 'executed', 'Kevin', 'Spacey', 'won', 'deserved', 'Oscar', 'portrayal', 'Lester', 'Burnham', 'Annette', 'Bening', 'was', 'also', 'nominated', 'performances', 'other', 'actors', 'are', 'played', 'delicacy', 'humanity', 'great', 'deal', 'believability.Well', 'recommended', 'must', 'see', 'fans', 'cinema']",Belleza Americana American Beauty  VHS

The general consensus of those people giving American Beauty 2 stars or lower is that it is &quot;unbelievable.&quot; Generally, these people refer to the characters, the plot, all that composes American Beauty's quirkiness. How do I respond to that?If you found American Beauty &quot;unbelievable,&quot; then the film was a success. This isn't a movie about taking what we've already seen, it's about taking what we've always been afraid to show. The fact that people are shocked by it and have trouble finding the truth in this film means that it has succeeded in all accounts. If you find this film offensive, if you find it too risque, if you find it &quot;unbelievable&quot; then you are the prime reason why it was absolutely necessary that this film be made.American Beauty appears &quot;unbelievable,&quot; I'll admit that; but that is only because we are all so negligent to our own hypocrisy. So many of us REFUSE to relate to Lester, or Caroline, or Angela, even though we secretly know just how dead on their portrayal is. We can say Lester blackmailing his boss is unbelievable, or we can admit that we would have more than a little ambition to do the same when it came our way. We can say that Lester's idealized fantasy with a teenager is unbelievable, or we can look at the mean of male society and understand that most men would have jumped at the opportunity that he had.American Beauty's greatest gift is it's concentration of pure truth. This may be a hard fact for most people to understand and they may deny it to themselves, but keep in mind that with such a diverse selection of characters, humanity can not totally distance itself from EVERY character. Every one holds some internal truth for ever viewer, if they are willing to accept it and not rush to the extremes that classify the whole film as &quot;unbelievable.&quot;This film just makes sense; it had to be made; the fact that it turned out so well is amazing. Every time I watch it, I conclude the viewing with the phrase &quot;you learn something new every time.&quot; And that is the absolute truth. I become more in tune with my own self every time I watch it; I reach an area of my existence that I have never seen before; I understand my motivations with a new and heightened perception. American Beauty doesn't do that by taking vacant stabs in the dark, it does it by showing humanity's most disavowed characteristics, the ones we regret, we deny, we term unbelievable when it applies to ourselves.This film is a classic. Perhaps it will gain a greater mainstream audience with time, but there is no reason we cannot apreciate it now. The image is recent: of turn of the century life in America. This is US, at our best and our worst. If you're not going to believe just how depraved you are, then you have no reason to believe how moral you are. We are a species plagued with both sides of the spectrum. American Beauty is one of the first films to show this.

67980,A318RKL1I9ABCM,0783239408,"""zaloop""","[13, 17]","In this story of American angst and family degeneration, Kevin Spacey plays Lester Burnham, father and husband, who hates his job, is getting fed up with his wife, and dislikes his life in general. One day, he snaps. He realizes how empty his life is, quits his job, and ceases to care about anything. He becomes free.First, the acting is among the best dramatic work you'll ever see in a film. Kevin Spacey (one of the best actors in film right now) and Annette Bening have some excellent performances. By now, we know that characters like Lester are the perfect roles for Spacey- cynical, attitudinal, sarcastic. The way he delivers his lines and acts is very impressive: managing to drop the subtlest notes of sarcasm and irony into his voice, being cool yet so acidic at the same time, and injecting his attitude with such cynicism and repressed emotion, he shows in this film why he's one of our best. Likewise, Annette Bening shines and is almost scary in how deeply she seems involved in her character, projecting her hyper uneasiness and the sense that she knows how pointless her life is, yet still tries to hide it.American Beauty discuss the image of the perfect American middle-class family, and the reality of it. In Lester's family and marriage, there is no American beauty. The film makes the case that true &quot;American beauty&quot; is probably not what you think it is- namely, not the seemingly happy family or guy with a nice job. But rather, real Beauty is to be found everywhere in life, if one simply looks for it. Lester snaps because he's intelligent: he realizes that his life holds no meaning for him, he hates his job, and his marriage is fake. Therefore, he quits, not just literally (his job), but figuratively (his former dull life), and tries to reinvigorate his life. He looks for Beauty.Likewise, Wes Bentley's neighbor, who falls in love with Lester's daughter, is an interesting and ironic character- he always looks depressed and dark, and spends his day simply recording mundane events, like a plastic bag floating in the wind. He shows footage of this meek, pathetic bag being tossed around in the wind, to Lester's daughter, because in this he finds Beauty. He is comforted by the idea that all of us, like the bag, are being tossed around in life, but that it's all in God's hands.I must mention how skillfully the film/script handles its teenage characters- they aren't stupid or caricatured, and they don't just mindly hate their parents for no reason, or anything like that. They are given personalities, and credibility (for we see, looking at Lester and his wife, that there may be a very good reason they don't want to be like them).This is part dark comedy and part drama, and I'm glad that, at the point when Lester decides to quit and do whatever he wants to do, it doesn't become a full-blown, cheesy comedy about a guy &quot;letting it all go.&quot; The film could've easily done that and turned into a series of comedy sketches involving Lester doing silly and wacky things with his freedom, but it didn't. (There are some times when it comes close, though.) Instead, it decides to create great drama out of it.This film makes a statement about American life and what it could turn into in extreme cases. It's about gaining freedom from an ugly, empty life, about appearances and the reality behind them. Take Mrs. Burnham. She's a real-estate agent, and she spends days tidying up a house in order to get a sale from someone; and when she doesn't, she breaks down. She's always busy doing something- cleaning, dusting, trimming the flowers, etc.- to keep herself occupied so that she doesn't realize the truth: that her life is empty. She never stops denying it to herself until the exciting climax. Lester, her husband, realizes it sooner; he comes to the conclusion that their marriage is simply an advertisement, a message to the world saying &quot;Hey, look at us, we're married, we're happy!&quot; And ironically, Lester's job (before he quit) was in advertising. Even his neighbor, the homophobic, strict, angry ex-colonel, has something repressed inside him.I must mention the excellent direction and cinematography for this film, which are impressive, from the sweeping pans of the camera to the surreal dream sequences Lester has when fantasizing about his daughter's cheerleader friend (rose petals, which come to symbolize the passion that has left Lester's life, swirl around her whenever he thinks of her).In short, the central theme of this film is &quot;look closer.&quot; If you think you see American beauty in our culture today, or if you think there is no real beauty left in the world today, look closer. Behind the advertisements, behind all the ugliness in this culture and life, look closer to find real American Beauty.",5,...look closer.,973641600,"11 8, 2000",2000,4798,"['story', 'American', 'angst', 'family', 'degeneration', 'Kevin', 'Spacey', 'Lester', 'Burnham', 'father', 'husband', 'who', 'job', 'getting', 'fed', 'up', 'wife', 'dislikes', 'life', 'general', 'One', 'day', 'how', 'empty', 'life', 'job', 'care', 'anything', 'free.First', 'acting', 'best', 'dramatic', 'work', ""'ll"", 'ever', 'see', 'film', 'Kevin', 'Spacey', 'one', 'best', 'actors', 'film', 'right', 'now', 'Annette', 'Bening', 'have', 'excellent', 'performances', 'now', 'know', 'characters', 'Lester', 'are', 'perfect', 'roles', 'Spacey-', 'cynical', 'attitudinal', 'sarcastic', 'way', 'lines', 'acts', 'very', 'impressive', 'managing', 'drop', 'subtlest', 'notes', 'sarcasm', 'irony', 'voice', 'being', 'cool', 'yet', 'so', 'acidic', 'same', 'time', 'injecting', 'attitude', 'such', 'cynicism', 'repressed', 'emotion', 'film', 'why', 'one', 'best', 'Likewise', 'Annette', 'Bening', 'shines', 'almost', 'scary', 'how', 'deeply', 'involved', 'character', 'projecting', 'hyper', 'uneasiness', 'sense', 'how', 'pointless', 'life', 'yet', 'still', 'hide', 'it.American', 'Beauty', 'image', 'perfect', 'American', 'middle-class', 'family', 'reality', 'Lester', 'family', 'marriage', 'American', 'beauty', 'film', 'case', 'true', 'quot', 'American', 'beauty', 'quot', 'probably', 'not', 'what', 'think', 'is-', 'namely', 'not', 'seemingly', 'happy', 'family', 'guy', 'nice', 'job', 'rather', 'real', 'Beauty', 'be', 'found', 'everywhere', 'life', 'one', 'simply', 'Lester', 'intelligent', 'life', 'meaning', 'job', 'marriage', 'fake', 'Therefore', 'not', 'just', 'literally', 'job', 'figuratively', 'former', 'dull', 'life', 'tries', 'reinvigorate', 'life', 'Beauty.Likewise', 'Wes', 'Bentley', 'neighbor', 'who', 'love', 'Lester', 'daughter', 'interesting', 'ironic', 'character-', 'always', 'depressed', 'dark', 'day', 'simply', 'recording', 'mundane', 'events', 'plastic', 'bag', 'floating', 'wind', 'footage', 'meek', 'pathetic', 'bag', 'being', 'tossed', 'wind', 'Lester', 'daughter', 'Beauty', 'comforted', 'idea', 'bag', 'are', 'being', 'tossed', 'life', 'God', 'hands.I', 'must', 'mention', 'how', 'skillfully', 'film/script', 'teenage', 'characters-', 'are', ""n't"", 'stupid', 'caricatured', 'do', ""n't"", 'just', 'mindly', 'hate', 'parents', 'reason', 'anything', 'are', 'given', 'personalities', 'credibility', 'see', 'looking', 'Lester', 'wife', 'may', 'be', 'very', 'good', 'reason', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'be', '.This', 'part', 'dark', 'comedy', 'part', 'drama', ""'m"", 'glad', 'point', 'when', 'Lester', 'quit', 'do', 'do', ""n't"", 'become', 'full-blown', 'cheesy', 'comedy', 'guy', 'quot', 'letting', 'go.', 'quot', 'film', 'could', ""'ve"", 'easily', 'done', 'turned', 'series', 'comedy', 'sketches', 'involving', 'Lester', 'doing', 'silly', 'wacky', 'things', 'freedom', 'did', ""n't"", 'are', 'times', 'when', 'close', 'Instead', 'create', 'great', 'drama', 'it.This', 'film', 'statement', 'American', 'life', 'what', 'could', 'turn', 'extreme', 'cases', 'gaining', 'freedom', 'ugly', 'empty', 'life', 'appearances', 'reality', 'Take', 'Mrs.', 'Burnham', 'real-estate', 'agent', 'days', 'tidying', 'up', 'house', 'order', 'get', 'sale', 'someone', 'when', ""n't"", 'down', 'always', 'busy', 'doing', 'something-', 'cleaning', 'dusting', 'trimming', 'flowers', 'etc.-', 'keep', 'occupied', ""n't"", 'realize', 'truth', 'life', 'empty', 'never', 'denying', 'herself', 'exciting', 'climax', 'Lester', 'husband', 'sooner', 'conclusion', 'marriage', 'simply', 'advertisement', 'message', 'world', 'saying', 'quot', 'Hey', 'look', ""'re"", 'married', ""'re"", 'happy', 'quot', 'ironically', 'Lester', 'job', 'quit', 'was', 'advertising', 'Even', 'neighbor', 'homophobic', 'strict', 'angry', 'ex-colonel', 'something', 'repressed', 'him.I', 'must', 'mention', 'excellent', 'direction', 'cinematography', 'film', 'are', 'impressive', 'sweeping', 'pans', 'camera', 'surreal', 'dream', 'sequences', 'Lester', 'when', 'fantasizing', 'daughter', 'cheerleader', 'friend', 'rose', 'petals', 'come', 'symbolize', 'passion', 'left', 'Lester', 'life', 'swirl', 'whenever', '.In', 'short', 'central', 'theme', 'film', 'quot', 'closer.', 'quot', 'think', 'see', 'American', 'beauty', 'culture', 'today', 'think', 'real', 'beauty', 'left', 'world', 'today', 'look', 'closer', 'advertisements', 'ugliness', 'culture', 'life', 'look', 'closer', 'find', 'real', 'American', 'Beauty']",Belleza Americana American Beauty  VHS
