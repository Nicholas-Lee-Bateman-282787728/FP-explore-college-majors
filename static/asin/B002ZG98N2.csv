It was a solid movie and quite enjoyable for its genre - and I think even a step above for that genre.It starts and ends with a nod to its comic book past, setting the scene so you get what's going on.  I really enjoyed those parts, they were well done.  (gory though, esp for kids)The rest of the movie was good.  It was mostly steampunk - the future if we had never left the steam era, with some exceptions; sort of mashes up frontier Old West with future, like Firefly (but with less technology).  Paul Bettany as ""Priest"" was quite good, that man can do brooding virtuous warrior like no-one else.  The other Priest (priestess), played by Maggie Q, just really stole the movie - I expected the usual overly-hot Lara Croft like character, and instead got a nuanced character with pathos, who also kicked ass.  Plus Maggie Q is *almost* pretty but not quite, although she is so awesome that by the end you decide she is... not the norm for her role.  They both created nuance out of cardboard characters, which was impressive - they managed to get more gut-clenching sexual tension out of barely-touching fingertips than most actors can get out of a full-fledged sex scene. Wow.  A lot of directorial restraint too.The not-subtle critique of the Catholic Church was over the top and boringly obvious.  Sometimes I wonder if anyone in Hollywood has ever met anyone with genuine faith. Sigh.  Then again, they needed something to move along the plot, and overly-controlling religion fit the bill, so ok.In all, it was a great popcorn movie.  One of the movies I'll actually buy and watch again, it's quite enjoyable.",4,Quite enjoyable for its genre,1315612800,"09 10, 2011",2011,1877,"['go', 'expecting', 'English', 'Patient', ""'ll"", 'be', 'disappointed', 'go', 'expecting', 'something', 'line', 'Resident', 'Evil', ""'ll"", 'enjoy', 'it.I', 'admit', 'was', 'expecting', 'hate', 'movie', 'based', 'other', 'reviews', 'was', 'so', 'pleasantly', 'surprised', 'was', 'solid', 'movie', 'quite', 'enjoyable', 'genre', 'think', 'even', 'step', 'genre.It', 'nod', 'comic', 'book', 'past', 'setting', 'scene', 'so', 'get', 'what', 'going', 'really', 'enjoyed', 'parts', 'were', 'well', 'done', 'gory', 'esp', 'kids', 'rest', 'movie', 'was', 'good', 'was', 'mostly', 'steampunk', 'future', 'had', 'never', 'left', 'steam', 'era', 'exceptions', 'sort', 'mashes', 'up', 'frontier', 'Old', 'West', 'future', 'Firefly', 'less', 'technology', 'Paul', 'Bettany', 'Priest', 'was', 'quite', 'good', 'man', 'can', 'do', 'brooding', 'virtuous', 'warrior', 'no-one', 'else', 'other', 'Priest', 'priestess', 'played', 'Maggie', 'Q', 'just', 'really', 'stole', 'movie', 'expected', 'usual', 'overly-hot', 'Lara', 'Croft', 'character', 'instead', 'got', 'nuanced', 'character', 'pathos', 'who', 'also', 'kicked', 'ass', 'Maggie', 'Q', '*almost*', 'pretty', 'not', 'quite', 'so', 'awesome', 'end', 'decide', 'not', 'norm', 'role', 'created', 'nuance', 'cardboard', 'characters', 'was', 'impressive', 'managed', 'get', 'more', 'gut-clenching', 'sexual', 'tension', 'barely-touching', 'fingertips', 'most', 'actors', 'can', 'get', 'full-fledged', 'sex', 'scene', 'Wow', 'lot', 'directorial', 'restraint', 'too.The', 'not-subtle', 'critique', 'Catholic', 'Church', 'was', 'top', 'boringly', 'obvious', 'Sometimes', 'wonder', 'anyone', 'Hollywood', 'ever', 'met', 'anyone', 'genuine', 'faith', 'Sigh', 'Then', 'again', 'needed', 'something', 'move', 'plot', 'overly-controlling', 'religion', 'fit', 'bill', 'ok.In', 'was', 'great', 'popcorn', 'movie', 'One', 'movies', ""'ll"", 'actually', 'buy', 'watch', 'again', 'quite', 'enjoyable']",N/A

I have to admit, I was rather surprised to find it's a very watchable and even enjoyable film. I won't go into plot details, as that's been well covered, suffice to say post-apocalyptic western flavored action film, and yes, it manages to hold the elements together pretty well. One interesting thing to me was that despite the church which rules what remains of humanity being thoroughly corrupt and facistic, the Priest characters themselves are shown as holding onto their belief in God, despite the massive and obvious failings of the church.  That probably counts as a plot twist in itself considering the short shrift faith generally receives in current movies.The Blu-Ray transfer looks extremely good, especially the sweeping desert vistas that serve as the backdrop for the majority of the film.I would rate this a solid 4 stars.

While there's really nothing new being offered here, it does turn out to be an overall enjoyable way to while away 87 minutes of viewing time. It has a unmistakable similarity in style and and temperament to the 2003 film 'Underworld' starring Kate Beckinsale. In 'Priest' our alluring femme fatale has been replaced by a fearless clergyman / warrior played by Paul Bettany who scowls and glares his way through a myriad of supernatural foes as he marches toward the Vampire Queens' nest. If you happen to be one of the many who watched 'Underworld' more for the presence of Beckinsale then the blood-suckers, you'll be happy to know that Bettany is accompanied on his heroic quest by the beautiful and just as deadly Maggie Q. That certainly should make you feel a little better.I don't think 'Priest' is destined to become a classic, but if you like this genre of film you'll find a place for this one in your DVD library. Bettany is great as always, Maggie Q makes a most interesting side-kick and Karl Urban is awesome in the role of Black Hat, one of my favorite bad guys in recent memory.

1308283,A3U7ELIED4WP4R,B002ZG98N2,Dark Faerie Tales,"[3, 6]","The Review:Priest starring Paul Bettany, Karl Urban, Cam Gigandet and La Femme Nikita herself, Maggie Q, is an action sci-fi beat `em up that's equal parts Mad Max and Underworld. It's a stylish film that doesn't quite escape B-movie status. Based on the Manga of the same name, Priest is the story of an alternate earth in which human kind has always been at war with the faster, stronger vampires. Mankind lives under a theocracy which governs the major cities that remain after some, presumably, vampire apocalypse.  For centuries humanity's sole advantage has been the sun. That is until the Church develops super powered warrior priests who turn the battle in humanity's favor. A priest is part Shaolin monk, part Jedi Knight with a touch of Neo from the Matrix.  Paul Bettany's character, Priest (seriously), is the best of the best who comes out of forced retirement after vampires attack his loved ones and kidnap Lucy, his niece.All in all, it's a great dystopian set-up, and the early city scenes are reminiscent of Blade Runner. The fact that Priest often evokes memories of other, better movies is part of why Priest doesn't ever make the leap from okay/good to great. What it does excel at is great action sequences and excellent worldbuilding, brought to life by beautiful art direction and set design. A special mention should be made to the creature effects. The vampires in Priest are animalistic. There's nothing sexy, or noble about them. It's an interesting choice, which has the downside of removing any serious characterization for 99.9% of the vamps in the movie. On the other hand Priest's vamps are rather unique in the genre, akin to the fast zombies of Dawn of the Dead and 28 Days Later. Unfortunately, personality for vamps, unlike for zombies, is very important. Faceless hordes of vampires provide lots of butts for Priest to kick, but little else.Priest's world is a dirty, dusty future version of the Wild West. Even though humans have long since won the war with vampires, it doesn't feel like a victory worth having as the Church casts an oppressive shadow over everyone and everything. Paul Bettany certainly classes things up. He might be headlining a near B-movie, but someone forgot to tell him that, and he boasts an A-plus performance. His nemesis, Black Hat, played by Karl Urban, isn't as well developed an antagonist as he should be. His motivations for throwing in with vampire kind are a little unsatisfying. Black Hat certainly proves a worthy adversary, but is a paper thin character.Ultimately, Priest is a fun movie for the action. It has intriguing elements, but doesn't quite reach the loftier heights of modern vampire action films such as 30 Days of Night, Underworld, Blade or the excellent Daybreakers. So, even with all my criticisms of Priest, I must confess, I still liked it for what it was, a big dumb action movie.P.S. Don't waste your money on 3-D for this movie. I felt as though it made a dark movie even darker, draining some of the color from the film.

The eyeless vampires are definately creepy. And while there are touches ofBlade, the Priest doesn't come off as a superhero or invincible, which adds a bit of an edge to the story.

1308290,A2FRKEXDXDN1KI,B002ZG98N2,Dennis A. Amith (kndy),"[4, 6]","Back in 1998, a manhwa  (Korean comic book) titled ""Priest"" was created by Hyung Min-woo and was released in the United States.  The comic book was inspired by the PC video game ""Blood"" and in 2005,  a loosely-based adaptation by Cory Goodman (""Apollo 18') was bought by Screen Gems in 2005.In 2009, the film was directed by Scott Stewart (known for his visual effects work), ""Sin City""and would star Paul Bettany (""The Da Vinci Code"", ""Iron Man"", ""A Beautiful Mind""), both men previously worked on the film ""Legion"".With the film set for release for 2010, because the film was being converted to 3D, ""Priest"" would receive its theatrical debut in North America in May 2011 and now, ""Priest: Unrated"" is set for release in August 2011 on Blu-ray and DVD.VIDEO:""Priest is presented in 1080p High Definition (2:40:1) and this dark and gritty vampire-killing film that looks fanastic on Blu-ray.  Blacks are nice and deep, detail for the film is fantastic as we can see various objects, landscapes with clarity.  Closeups of the detail on the skin of the character's faces is quite clear and there is also a layer of grain included as well.I didn't notice any problems with artifacts, edge enhancement and for the most part, Sony Pictures Home Entertainment has constantly given Blu-ray fans awesome picture quality and it is no different for ""Priest: Unrated"".AUDIO & SUBTITLES:""Priest: Unrated"" is presented in English, French, Spanish 5.1 DTS-HD MA and English - Audio Description Track.  I have to give high marks to ""Priest"" for its lossless audio.  Audiophiles will love how effectively the sounds were mixed for various directions.  There is good amount of LFE, dialogue is crystal clear and also good use for ambiance through the front and surround channels.  Especially weather elements of wind and rain but also just that eerie vibe that you get from the look and feel of the film and just hearing the music and the various sounds, the sound editor did a great job on the soundtrack.Subtitles are in English, English SDH, Spanish, French and Portuguese.SPECIAL FEATURES:""Priest: Unrated"" comes with the following special features:PS3 Theme - If you have a PS3, you can install a ""Priest"" Ps3 theme.movieIQ - View information online for the film while watching ""Priest"".Bullets and Crucifixes: Picture-in-Picture Experience - While watching the film, hear from the director and cast on the making of ""Priest"" and other details related to the film.Commentary with Director Scott Stewart, Writer Cory Goodman, Paul Bettany and Maggie Q - While details can be found on the picture-in-picture experience, hear the director, writer and actor Paul Bettany and actress Maggie Q giving viewers insight on the making of the film.Deleted and Extended Scenes - (12:31) Seven deleted and extended scenes.The Bloody Frontier: Creating the World of Priest - (12:49) The challenge of creating the alternate world of ""Priest"".Tools of the Trade: The Weapons and Vehicles of Priest - (11:25) Featuring the weapons and vehicles of ""Priest"" and bringing it to the world on film.Twisted Metal Uncut Trailer - (2:31) Trailer for the upcoming Sony PlayStation 3 video game ""Twisted Metal"".EXTRAS:Comes with an insert with a code to download a ""Priest"" skin for ""Twisted Metal"" on October 4, 2011.JUDGMENT CALL:I'm probably much more accepting to ""Priest"" than the film critics were because I read a lot of graphic novels, especially from Asia and I'm also into alternate universe in a steampunkish way and the fact that introduces vampires that are not pretty boys and are just downright fugly and ferocious, I was digging it!I have to say that I was quite skeptical at first because the last time I watched a film with Scott Stewart and Paul Bettany together, it was ""Legend"" and it was all visual effects with a bad story.Not to say that ""Priest"" is great when it comes to storytelling but I enjoyed this film much more than ""Legion"" and the concept of the priests and vampires at war and the fact that the overall look of the film managed to look gritty and dark but the use of blues and warm colors to separate the church cities and what was taking place outside with the vampires and humans, for me it was quite intriguing.It's a short film at 87-minutes and I'm going to be truthful, outside of the main storyline between Priest and him breaking the rules of the church, I felt the whole movie was a bit of a blur and I was focusing more on the visual effects and action.  Suffice to say, seeing Maggie Q with Paul Bettany was a pretty cool collaboration and because I watched ""Legion"" and was expecting something along the lines of visual eye-candy with no substance ala ""Legion"", I came in expecting somewhat the worst and so, I was pretty surprised that I enjoyed this film much better than what I was expecting.As for the film, I can't tell you what difference there is between the unrated and normal version of the film.  I think that for me, the lack of including both films on the Blu-ray release was a bummer!For the Blu-ray release, I was impressed by the picture and audio quality and that there were a good number of special features and that they got the talent involved for the audio commentary.  But what about the film?  The film was good in a popcorn action kind of way.  When it comes to vampire films, in this day and age, it's been overdone and you just want to see something different.  So,  I did like the fact that ""Priest: Unrated"" made the vampires really ugly and ferocious.I will say that for an ""unrated"" release, I was expecting more violence or even blood or more dismemberment.  I thought this was going to showcase something disgusting along the lines of horror and it never happened in this film.  If anything, we see families getting thrashed by the vampires but instead of showcasing any of those scenes, we hear it instead of see it.Overall, ""Priest: Unrated"" was an enjoyable film that was not necessarily great but comparing it to Stewart and Bettany's last work together on ""Legion"", ""Priest: Unrated"" was much more enjoyable and if it was visual eye-candy, I preferred ""Priest"" over ""Legion"".If you are the type who likes action films with a lot of fighting and a lot of visual effects and doesn't have a strong plot, you can't go wrong with ""Priest: Unrated"".  Otherwise, if you are looking for a deeper film and plot is much more important than visual effects and action, then ""Priest: Unrated"" is definitely not for you.",3,"Blu-ray: (3.5 stars) A good

1308293,A3NP3KZXLP5PG1,B002ZG98N2,DL,"[3, 3]","Several of my coworkers strongly urged me to avoid this movie. I think one of them even went so far to say this was one of the worst movies they had ever seen. That's a pretty bold statement! There are some pretty terrible movies being made these days especially when you consider all the horrible remakes/reboots Hollywood has been trying to force on us. After being told for the fourth or fifth time to not see it my curiosity had peaked. I immediately went down to the local rental store and picked up the movie Priest on Blu Ray.The first thing I notice when I pop the Blu Ray disc into the PS3 is the Priest theme (which automatically installs) that is now displayed on the PS3 XMB. I didn't mind that at all because the theme actually looked pretty awesome! After navigating the usual amount of movie and game trailers it's finally time to begin what some have described to me as a completely dreadful film. Thankfully the Blu Ray transfer is really sharp and so is the sound quality. By far not the best I have seen on Blu Ray, but pretty dang good. After watching the movie for about 10-15 minutes I really started to get into it. While the story was not completely groundbreaking there was enough originality in it to keep me wanting to see what would happen next. The landscapes/scenery looked astounding (except for most of the scenes in the Hive, which looked really bland) and the future technology used by the cast was believable enough. While watching this movie you may be reminded of Mad Max, Aliens, and Bladerunner. I am not going to say Priest is anywhere near on the level of those movies, but it does share some of their better qualities.I have not included too much information for fear of giving away the central plot theme which is the one of the few things that separates this movie from some of the other vampire trash movies that have been released in the last 4-5 years. Reading other reviews I see a lot of complaining about the way religion or vampires were portrayed in the movie. If those are the only things that caused you to rate this movie one or two stars then you are taking this movie way too seriously. Overall, this is a fun movie to watch with a good story and some decent acting.",4,"Was told ""Don't see this movie!"" glad I didn't listen",1316822400,"09 24, 2011",2011,2223,"['Several', 'coworkers', 'strongly', 'urged', 'avoid', 'movie', 'think', 'one', 'even', 'went', 'so', 'far', 'say', 'was', 'one', 'worst', 'movies', 'had', 'ever', 'seen', 'pretty', 'bold', 'statement', 'are', 'pretty', 'terrible', 'movies', 'being', 'made', 'days', 'especially', 'when', 'consider', 'horrible', 'remakes/reboots', 'Hollywood', 'been', 'trying', 'force', 'being', 'told', 'fourth', 'fifth', 'time', 'not', 'see', 'curiosity', 'had', 'peaked', 'immediately', 'went', 'down', 'local', 'rental', 'store', 'picked', 'up', 'movie', 'Priest', 'Blu', 'Ray.The', 'first', 'thing', 'notice', 'when', 'pop', 'Blu', 'Ray', 'disc', 'PS3', 'Priest', 'theme', 'automatically', 'now', 'displayed', 'PS3', 'XMB', 'did', ""n't"", 'mind', 'theme', 'actually', 'looked', 'pretty', 'awesome', 'navigating', 'usual', 'amount', 'movie', 'game', 'trailers', 'finally', 'time', 'begin', 'what', 'have', 'described', 'completely', 'dreadful', 'film', 'Thankfully', 'Blu', 'Ray', 'transfer', 'really', 'sharp', 'so', 'sound', 'quality', 'far', 'not', 'best', 'have', 'seen', 'Blu', 'Ray', 'pretty', 'dang', 'good', 'watching', 'movie', '10-15', 'minutes', 'really', 'started', 'get', 'story', 'was', 'not', 'completely', 'groundbreaking', 'was', 'enough', 'originality', 'keep', 'wanting', 'see', 'what', 'would', 'happen', 'next', 'landscapes/scenery', 'looked', 'astounding', 'most', 'scenes', 'Hive', 'looked', 'really', 'bland', 'future', 'technology', 'used', 'cast', 'was', 'believable', 'enough', 'watching', 'movie', 'may', 'be', 'reminded', 'Mad', 'Max', 'Aliens', 'Bladerunner', 'am', 'not', 'going', 'say', 'Priest', 'anywhere', 'near', 'level', 'movies', 'share', 'better', 'qualities.I', 'have', 'not', 'included', 'too', 'much', 'information', 'fear', 'giving', 'away', 'central', 'plot', 'theme', 'one', 'few', 'things', 'movie', 'other', 'vampire', 'trash', 'movies', 'have', 'been', 'released', 'last', '4-5', 'years', 'Reading', 'other', 'reviews', 'see', 'lot', 'complaining', 'way', 'religion', 'vampires', 'were', 'portrayed', 'movie', 'are', 'only', 'things', 'caused', 'rate', 'movie', 'one', 'two', 'stars', 'then', 'are', 'taking', 'movie', 'way', 'too', 'seriously', 'Overall', 'fun', 'movie', 'watch', 'good', 'story', 'decent', 'acting']",N/A

A Solinas ""ea_solinas""","[21, 41]","Min-Woo Hyung's ""Priest"" was a Korean manhwa about a gun-toting priest who sets out to defeat a gang of fallen angels bent on destroying the world.Now forget about that, because the movie ""Priest"" has absolutely nothing to do with the manhwa. Instead, this a generic vampire-slaying/rescue/revenge movie set in a completely generic dystopic future, with a choppy rushed story and painfully predictable writing. Paul Bettany is mildly cool, but we're never really given a reason to care about his character.It takes place in a dystopian future where vampires have... somehow turned the world into a desert wasteland, before being shut up in reservations. The only surviving authority is the Catholic Church, who trained vampire-slaying Priests to kill vampires -- but after the war, they were disbanded and are now shunned.Several years later, a small-town sheriff (Cam Gigandet) enters the walled city to ask the help of an unnamed Priest (Paul Bettany): the Priest's brother and sister-in-law have been murdered by vampires, and his niece has been captured. Against the orders of the Monsignor, he sets out to rescue his niece... but he doesn't know that she's in the grasp of an old enemy.Since it basically dumped the manhwa plot, ""Priest"" is cobbled together with bits of other movies: ""Blade II,"" ""Judge Dredd,"" ""The Searchers,"" ""Mad Max,"" a teeny bit of ""Lord of the Rings,"" and especially ""Solomon Kane."" And no, it's nowhere NEAR as much fun as any of the above films, even the horrible ones -- it's too bad to be enjoyable, but not nearly bad enough to be funny.And Scott Stewart is just AWFUL -- what else could you expect from the guy who made ""Legion""? Horrible dialogue (""I can smell the blood running through your veins. Smells like... dinner""), chaotic action scenes that might give you a seizure, and lots of unintentionally hilarious moments (usually the ones in slow-motion). I have to admit, the eyeless jagged-toothed vampires ARE a bit cool.But even a good director couldn't have made this mess anything but mediocre. There's barely a plot, lots of predictable ""twists,"" huge plot holes, and only some vague attempts at backstory. Everything feels like it was lazily slapped together without much thought, and Stewart just rushes on through as quickly as he can.Paul Bettany's character is as wooden as a plywood cross, and he's never really given any backstory or development to make us like him. He just drifts around in a quasi-religious, stone-faced haze of mild boredom. Gigandet is... okay; Maggie Q is pretty awesome as the buttkicking warrior Priestess, although I never understood why she was helping Bettany.As for Black Hat... aw, Karl Urban, why do you do this to me?

Van Court ""Van""","[49, 55]","I'm sorry, ""graphic novel"" action film.All sarcasm aside, ""Priest"" was exactly as advertised; excellent science fiction action, well suited for popcorn.  And I enjoyed the heck out of it.In an alternate earth, the Church and vampires have been at war for centuries.  Technology didn't offer the solution, recruiting and training extraordinary fighters, the Priests, did.  And when the church had won, and the vampires were contained in underground reservations, the Priests were not needed.  The Church marginalized the Priests, and didn't want to admit that their control was incomplete, so when the vampires escaped the reservation and raided a farm house, they didn't want to acknowledge that the vampires were loose, or that the Priests were needed again.  But the settlers killed and kidnapped by the vampires were friends of a Priest.While Paul Bettany delivered an outstanding performance (of its sort) in the title role, Maggie Q, Karl Urban, and Christopher Plummer really carried it for me.  Bettany delivered the brooding warrior priest very well, delivering intensity and portraying a man trying to reconcile conflicting duties well.  The role didn't allow him great range, but he did the most with it.  Maggie Q was allowed a far greater range as another Priest with chaste love for the hero.  Her roles are getting more serious, and she is finally getting a chance to show her abilities.  Well, she's always gotten to show off her martial arts gifts, and she does again here too.  Karl Urban also gets a well earned, central role in this one, but aside from saying that he does an excellent job in a different character from earlier roles, I can't go further without spoilers.  Christopher Plummer, of course, was excellent, adding depth and power to the role of the senior clergyman and political leader in the Church.The action was first rate, the plot was solid, and the actors were exceptional.

1308302,ASIEGG17K1UID,B002ZG98N2,"Ex-Buyer ""Thomas""","[1, 2]","So, here's the deal....I read all the reviews, and I mean ALL the reviews before I purchased this Blu-Ray.  Even though I had reservations, I went with it, being I love vampire/horror/sci-fi movies.  It took 3 viewings before I decided to write this review, and that included watching the extras, especially the deleted/extended scenes.  Here is my honest conclusion.First, if I were to write this review after one watching, I would have to agree with those that gave it a one-star, this was dreadful after one viewing.  The worse part, is the opening animation.  It insults the intelligence of any audience, and is so poorly done (in that Speed Racer, 1960s, bad Japanese style) that it is laughable, and makes you not want to not only watch this movie any longer, but actually sets you up to believe this might be a comedy.  I completely fail to understand why this was done in that manner, but without a doubt, that should have beed edited from the beginning.Seconds, My thought was how poorly written the script is, it is so predicatable and pretencious that even Paul Bettany, Cam Gigandet and Karl Urban had an issue making these poorly written lines seem plausable.Third, the ending was so weak...I can't even continue.  So you would think I would just place this away, never to be seen again.  I did not.I decided, I would watch it again and then watch the extras...especially the deleted/etended scenes.  What I found amazed me....they cut out some of the best parts.First, the orignial opening scene should have contained the extended cut, it would have framed the story much better( I said the story, not the writing, that there is no hope for) and there would have been much more action in the beginning to keep you somewhat entertained.  Granted, that horrible animation would have been there, but at least with an extended opening scene, you would have forgotten about the animation.Second, the  next to final scene should have been the deleted scene of Lucy and The Priest at the farm, with her asking him to stay.  It would have added a ""human"" quality to the film that was poorly missing.  Then the final shot could have been the current final shot.Third, While some of the photography seemed like reused footage from Batman and other movies, overall I thought the cinematagraphy was well done and the atmosphere did convey what a horror movie should conveyFourth, purly and simply, the Direction and Screenplay were just so trite and I mean trite, that three good actors could not save it. Also, what is the purpose of having Cam Gigandet in a movie if at some point in time he does not take his shirt off (think Twilight and Burlesque).So, while I will admit, the outakes , in some bizarre way, made me appreciate this movie a bit more, and bring it from my original rating I would have given it of one star to three stars, it is still fairly dreadful.  One can only hope, if there are sequels, they not be handled by the current Director and Screenwriter.",3,Got a bit better the second time around...,1314835200,"09 1, 2011",2011,2975,"['So', 'here', 'deal', 'read', 'reviews', 'mean', 'reviews', 'purchased', 'Blu-Ray', 'Even', 'had', 'reservations', 'went', 'being', 'love', 'vampire/horror/sci-fi', 'movies', 'took', '3', 'viewings', 'decided', 'write', 'review', 'included', 'watching', 'extras', 'especially', 'deleted/extended', 'scenes', 'Here', 'honest', 'conclusion.First', 'were', 'write', 'review', 'one', 'watching', 'would', 'have', 'agree', 'gave', 'one-star', 'was', 'dreadful', 'one', 'viewing', 'worse', 'part', 'opening', 'animation', 'intelligence', 'audience', 'so', 'poorly', 'done', 'Speed', 'Racer', '1960s', 'bad', 'Japanese', 'style', 'laughable', 'not', 'want', 'not', 'only', 'watch', 'movie', 'longer', 'actually', 'sets', 'up', 'believe', 'might', 'be', 'comedy', 'completely', 'fail', 'understand', 'why', 'was', 'done', 'manner', 'doubt', 'should', 'have', 'beed', 'edited', 'beginning.Seconds', 'My', 'thought', 'was', 'how', 'poorly', 'written', 'script', 'so', 'predicatable', 'pretencious', 'even', 'Paul', 'Bettany', 'Cam', 'Gigandet', 'Karl', 'Urban', 'had', 'issue', 'making', 'poorly', 'written', 'lines', 'seem', 'plausable.Third', 'ending', 'was', 'so', 'weak', 'ca', ""n't"", 'even', 'continue', 'would', 'think', 'would', 'just', 'place', 'away', 'never', 'be', 'seen', 'again', 'did', 'not.I', 'decided', 'would', 'watch', 'again', 'then', 'watch', 'extras', 'especially', 'deleted/etended', 'scenes', 'What', 'found', '.they', 'cut', 'out', 'best', 'parts.First', 'orignial', 'opening', 'scene', 'should', 'have', 'contained', 'extended', 'cut', 'would', 'have', 'framed', 'story', 'much', 'better', 'said', 'story', 'not', 'writing', 'hope', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'much', 'more', 'action', 'beginning', 'keep', 'somewhat', 'entertained', 'Granted', 'horrible', 'animation', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'there', 'least', 'extended', 'opening', 'scene', 'would', 'have', 'forgotten', 'animation.Second', 'next', 'final', 'scene', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'deleted', 'scene', 'Lucy', 'Priest', 'farm', 'asking', 'stay', 'would', 'have', 'added', 'human', 'quality', 'film', 'was', 'poorly', 'missing', 'Then', 'final', 'shot', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'current', 'final', 'shot.Third', 'photography', 'seemed', 'reused', 'footage', 'Batman', 'other', 'movies', 'overall', 'thought', 'cinematagraphy', 'was', 'well', 'done', 'atmosphere', 'did', 'convey', 'what', 'horror', 'movie', 'should', 'conveyFourth', 'purly', 'simply', 'Direction', 'Screenplay', 'were', 'just', 'so', 'trite', 'mean', 'trite', 'three', 'good', 'actors', 'could', 'not', 'save', 'Also', 'what', 'purpose', 'having', 'Cam', 'Gigandet', 'movie', 'point', 'time', 'not', 'take', 'shirt', 'think', 'Twilight', 'Burlesque', '.So', 'will', 'admit', 'outakes', 'bizarre', 'way', 'made', 'appreciate', 'movie', 'bit', 'more', 'bring', 'original', 'rating', 'would', 'have', 'given', 'one', 'star', 'three', 'stars', 'still', 'fairly', 'dreadful', 'One', 'can', 'only', 'hope', 'are', 'sequels', 'not', 'be', 'handled', 'current', 'Director', 'Screenwriter']",N/A

For example, sometimes an individual who is striving for Holy Living under the One God of Love and Peace is compelled by The Holy Spirit (God's Spirit) to get his or her hands dirty and choose to be used as an instrument by God who anoints him with supernatural abilities.  His Faith in God is true, yet he knows that he must do Good Works, too.Another theological application is that the main villain (main antagonist) is not the once-good priest who was captured and unwillingly turned evil or the Mother of The Hive; the main evil is the head leader of the human government who IS their judicial, legislative and executive branch in one person.  Most importantly, that one leader (The One) deceives and controls Holy Men and Women and all those under his Anti-Godly SPELL in their human theocracy.This antagonist refuses to call evil what evil is and refuses to use powerful and anointed resources at his disposal to destroy evil.  Instead, this antagonist orders the use of these same resources AGAINST Good Men doing Good.The antagonist leader represents the Ultimate Enemy and represents the Ultimate Evil in human skin.  He serves as the most senior human leader: as Commander In Chief of the most powerful human Force of Good on earth, which is a Christian-based nation (a cross is used extensively in the movie).Any similarity to this antagonist character in the movie to a current leader in the United States is fully in the reader's discernment.Keep the Faith and be of good cheer because Good ultimately prevails over evil.

1308307,A328S9RN3U5M68,B002ZG98N2,Grady Harp,"[1, 3]","PRIEST is an amazing film in one way: how did a cast of fine actors sign on to commit to this sticky gooey film? It is based on a comic book/graphic novel story (hint) by Min-Woo Hyung and roughly adapted for the screen by Cory Goodman and pasted together for 3D action by director Scott Charles Stewart.  The PR summary is as adept as any explanation of the 'plot' (hint): 'PRIEST, a post-apocalyptic sci-fi thriller, is set in an alternate world -- one ravaged by centuries of war between man and vampires. The story revolves around a legendary Warrior Priest from the last Vampire War who now lives in obscurity among the other downtrodden human inhabitants in walled-in dystopian cities ruled by the Church. When his niece is abducted by a murderous pack of vampires, Priest breaks his sacred vows to venture out on a quest to find her before they turn her into one of them. He is joined on his crusade by his niece's boyfriend, a trigger-fingered young wasteland sheriff, and a former Warrior Priestess who possesses otherworldly fighting skills.'Now the graphics take over.  Paul Bettany is sincerely obsessed as the Priest, Cam Gigandet provides the eye candy in his portrayal of Hicks - sidekick to the Priest along with a young Priestess (Maggie Q), Karl Urban spends the greater part of his screen time hidden behind his Black Hat (the characters name),  Christopher Plummer (why oh why?) is given the cameo of Monsignor Orelas, and the two beauties of the film are incarnate in Maggie Q and Lily Collins.  The majority of the action involves a seemingly endless supply of goo covered all-teeth-and-no-head bouncing vampires that perhaps is the reason this film was made as a 3D horror flick. In the regular screen these vampires become rather reminiscent of silly putty rolled in nasal secretions.  For those legions of followers of anything resembling Vampires, this will likely appeal.  For those who can tolerate all the action as long as there is a story line, this is probably one to miss.  But it may be worth seeing as a 3D epic...so why did the solid cast sign on/  More to come, likely.

Bala ""Me Too Can Read""","[1, 4]","Fresh off their mind-numbing supernatural talkfest LEGION, Paul Bettany and director Scott Stewart have at it again, this time with a somewhat improved effort. PRIEST is a hybrid of vampire horror, dystopian Mad Maxian sci-fi, and the western. It sees Bettany demoted from a righteous archangel in LEGION to a warrior priest in this one, and bearing a tattooed cross on his mug and an aura of perpetual broodiness. This role is a far cry from his winning comedic roles in WIMBLEDON and A KNIGHT'S TALE. It's a good thing he's got presence.A no-holds-barred animated prologue establishes the back story. In this reality, vampires have existed in the open since Hector was a pup and they've been at war with mankind since forever. What finally turned the tide in humanity's favor is the emergence of the Church's elite warrior priests. With the war won and the vampires believed to have been completely eradicated, the warrior priests were summarily disbanded, abandoned and left to fend for themselves as best they can. Most of them found it difficult to reacclimate to society. It's hard going from the summit to the cellar.""To go against the Church is to go against God."" We hear that sweet bromide several times throughout the film, and we rapidly realize we're in one of them films in which the Church is totalitarian and wields absolute control. To illustrate this, the big metropolis is called Cathedral City, a place that's better to look at than to live in. For what it's worth, the steam- and cyber-punk designs make it visually interesting.Paul Bettany builds up his action hero creds, playing the titular role. When his niece is abducted by vampires (not as eradicated as everyone believed), Bettany's warrior priest defies the ruling monsignor's wish that he not intervene and he goes rogue. He's soon accompanied by a warrior priestess (Maggie Q) and a young hotshot outpost sheriff (Cam Gigandet), neither of whom brought along a good script. Witness the acting performances, more flat than the desolate desert wastelands thru which these would-be rescuers make their arduous trek. It's like everyone followed Bettany's choice of playing his part as stoic and resolute. I do like that Bettany does a bit of what John Wayne did in THE SEARCHERS. The priest is coldly adamant that a vampire shan't be suffered to live. There's some mystery as to what he'll do should his kidnapped niece turn out to be infected.I'm giving PRIEST 3.5 out of 5 stars, so I'm recommending it, even though there's a decided lack of sizzle. The story unfolds by the numbers. The actors aren't given enough to do. The f/x is decent without being eye-popping. The action sequences are worth watching without being innovative. Bettany sells the fighty fights convincingly enough, although I wish the film hadn't relied so much on editing trickeration and those ""bullet time"" effects. But that seems to be the trend nowadays with American action films. (Thank goodness for Hong Kong action films.) Still, that scene in which Maggie Q tosses those chunks of rock in the air so that Bettany can use them as stepping stones to reach a vampire target - well, that was pretty cool. If you like movies like BLADE and UNDERWORLD, there's something here for you. It's just something that isn't as good.",4,"Well, it's better than LEGION",1306627200,"05 29, 2011",2011,3279,"['Fresh', 'off', 'mind-numbing', 'supernatural', 'talkfest', 'LEGION', 'Paul', 'Bettany', 'director', 'Scott', 'Stewart', 'have', 'again', 'time', 'somewhat', 'improved', 'effort', 'PRIEST', 'hybrid', 'vampire', 'horror', 'dystopian', 'Mad', 'Maxian', 'sci-fi', 'western', 'Bettany', 'demoted', 'righteous', 'archangel', 'LEGION', 'warrior', 'priest', 'one', 'bearing', 'tattooed', 'cross', 'mug', 'aura', 'perpetual', 'broodiness', 'role', 'far', 'cry', 'winning', 'comedic', 'roles', 'WIMBLEDON', 'A', 'KNIGHT', 'TALE', 'good', 'thing', 'got', 'presence.A', 'no-holds-barred', 'animated', 'prologue', 'back', 'story', 'reality', 'vampires', 'have', 'existed', 'open', 'Hector', 'was', 'pup', ""'ve"", 'been', 'war', 'mankind', 'forever', 'What', 'finally', 'turned', 'tide', 'humanity', 'favor', 'emergence', 'Church', 'elite', 'warrior', 'priests', 'war', 'won', 'vampires', 'believed', 'have', 'been', 'completely', 'eradicated', 'warrior', 'priests', 'were', 'summarily', 'disbanded', 'abandoned', 'left', 'fend', 'can', 'Most', 'found', 'difficult', 'reacclimate', 'society', 'hard', 'going', 'summit', 'cellar', 'go', 'Church', 'go', 'God', 'hear', 'sweet', 'bromide', 'several', 'times', 'film', 'rapidly', 'realize', ""'re"", 'one', 'films', 'Church', 'totalitarian', 'wields', 'absolute', 'control', 'illustrate', 'big', 'metropolis', 'called', 'Cathedral', 'City', 'place', 'better', 'look', 'live', 'what', 'worth', 'steam-', 'cyber-punk', 'designs', 'make', 'visually', 'Bettany', 'up', 'action', 'hero', 'creds', 'playing', 'titular', 'role', 'When', 'niece', 'abducted', 'vampires', 'not', 'as', 'eradicated', 'everyone', 'believed', 'Bettany', 'warrior', 'priest', 'ruling', 'monsignor', 'wish', 'not', 'intervene', 'rogue', 'soon', 'accompanied', 'warrior', 'priestess', 'Maggie', 'Q', 'young', 'hotshot', 'outpost', 'sheriff', 'Cam', 'Gigandet', 'whom', 'brought', 'along', 'good', 'script', 'acting', 'performances', 'more', 'flat', 'desolate', 'desert', 'wastelands', 'thru', 'would-be', 'rescuers', 'make', 'arduous', 'trek', 'everyone', 'followed', 'Bettany', 'choice', 'playing', 'part', 'stoic', 'resolute', 'do', 'Bettany', 'bit', 'what', 'John', 'Wayne', 'did', 'THE', 'SEARCHERS', 'priest', 'coldly', 'adamant', 'vampire', 'sha', ""n't"", 'be', 'suffered', 'live', 'mystery', 'what', ""'ll"", 'do', 'should', 'kidnapped', 'niece', 'turn', 'out', 'be', 'infected.I', ""'m"", 'giving', 'PRIEST', '3.5', '5', 'stars', ""'m"", 'recommending', 'even', 'decided', 'lack', 'sizzle', 'story', 'unfolds', 'numbers', 'actors', 'are', ""n't"", 'given', 'enough', 'do', 'f/x', 'decent', 'being', 'eye-popping', 'action', 'sequences', 'are', 'worth', 'watching', 'being', 'innovative', 'Bettany', 'fighty', 'fights', 'convincingly', 'enough', 'wish', 'film', 'had', ""n't"", 'relied', 'so', 'much', 'editing', 'trickeration', 'bullet', 'time', 'effects', 'be', 'trend', 'American', 'action', 'films', 'Thank', 'goodness', 'Hong', 'Kong', 'action', 'films', 'Still', 'scene', 'Maggie', 'Q', 'chunks', 'rock', 'air', 'Bettany', 'can', 'use', 'stepping', 'stones', 'reach', 'vampire', 'target', 'well', 'was', 'pretty', 'cool', 'like', 'movies', 'BLADE', 'UNDERWORLD', 'something', 'here', 'just', 'something', ""n't"", 'as', 'good']",N/A

Yet, ""Priest,"" while starting out strong, sadly doesn't take full advantage of it's source material to make a compelling tale.""Priest"" takes place in a post apocalyptic version of earth, where, for thousands of years, humanity and vampires have been at war.

The idea of a super-corrupt church trying to maintain it's power at any cost while a vampire menace threatens to kill everyone is fascinating, even more so if some of it's powerful soldiers defy it.

1308313,A2BFIYZYNK54QX,B002ZG98N2,"James Donnelly ""Ave Atque Vale""","[1, 4]","Watching the animated opening to PRIEST that gives us the backstory of the war between Humans and Vampires, the one thing that I kept thinking was that I wished the whole film could have been that visually striking and powerfully told. Sadly, it's not. Scott Stewart, originally a visual effects creator for films like IRON MAN, SUPERMAN RETURNS and SIN CITY, made his foray into feature film directing with the incredibly awful LEGION (also with this film's star Paul Bettany) and continues to make films that are visually derivative, bereft of suspense or natural momentum, and wastes of talent.In the beginning, there were men and there were vampires. Apparently things got so bad that in humanity's darkness, we turned to The Church to salvation, and they gave us these warrior priests; super-powered devout killing machines. Once the war ends, vampires SEEM to be gone, and most of humanity have huddled together inside these massive walled cities under a theocratic rule. The Priests themselves have no place in this new society since they were trained to kill, and that's all. From all this, we have the Priest With No Name (Bettany, continuing to try to make a name for himself in action films for some inexplicable reason) who is visited with sorrowful news by a small wasteland town sheriff (Cam Gigandet, of TWILIGHT and EASY A and a Channing Tatum clone). This sheriff, named Hicks, tells the Priest that his brother (an ironic cameo of sorts by Stephen Moyer), his wife (Madchen Amick of TWIN PEAKS and DAMAGES) and daughter (Lily Collins of THE BLIND SIDE and MIRROR MIRROR) have been attacked by vampires. The wife is dead; the father is near death and the daughter has been taken. The Priest goes before the bureaucratic/theocratic Monsignors who control the city, represented by a phoning-it-in Christopher Plummer and asks to be reinstated as a Priest. They say no way no day, since there is no more vampire menace. Is that going to stop our perpetually scowling hero? No way, no day. So the Priest and Hicks venture out on super-duper motorcycles into the vast wasteland beyond the city walls. Meanwhile the captive girl we find is being held by a former priest-turned-vampire played by the great Karl Urban (LORD OF THE RINGS trilogy, STAR TREK) who channels some fun here as the flamboyantly eeeeeevil villain, but his role is sadly underwritten. Also coming onboard is fellow Priestess Maggie Q (MISSION: IMPOSSIBLE 3, NIKITA) who also is perpetually scowling except when her inner unrequited love for the Priest is not-so-subtly revealed. Therefore, the plot propels... wait... there is no plot. The action propels us forth into underground prisons, big bee-like hives of vampires, old west-style towns and a train filled with eeeeevil.I have nothing against an action movie being just an action movie for action's sake (look at MISSION IMPOSSIBLE: GHOST PROTOCOL), but give us something DIFFERENT. This is essentially a bizarre mashup of aesthetics from the MAD MAX wastelands, the Man With No Name westerns, the UNDERWORLD super slo-mo vamp fighting, as well as visual cues from films like BLADE RUNNER, EQUILIBRIUM and THE BOOK OF ELI. What's more tragic than apeing every other type of film to create something so incredibly soulless is the utter and complete waste of talented people. Paul Bettany has proven time and again that he's an incredibly charming and talented actor, yet for whatever reason, he kept appearing in Stewart's terrible films (admittedly, this isn't as bad as LEGION, but that's not saying much). Maggie Q has shown incredible talent and range during her tenure as the titluar character on NIKITA, but she's given nothing to do here but either be a dour bad-ass, or be a pining female stereotype. Karl Urban is starting to show that he's really not that much better than the films he's in. When he's in films like THE LORD OF THE RINGS or STAR TREK or THE BOURNE SUPREMACY, he's very good; when he's in films like THE CHRONICLES OF RIDDICK or RED or DOOM, he's really not very good. Cam Gigandet is all jaw and swagger, but is the only actor who looks like he's here to make a film. Lily Collins is literally nothing more than a pretty face here, and other great character actors like Alan Dale and Brad Dourif are just here gettin' paid.I'm sure that the original graphic novel by Min Woo-Hyung is pretty cool, but the film version of PRIEST is a whole lot of everything we've seen before and done quite a bit better by everyone else.",2,A sorrowful mashup of genres with a lot of

1308315,A2YM3KILJ1G0YJ,B002ZG98N2,Jason,"[5, 7]","Equal parts post-apocalyptic industrial andMad Maxwasteland, the bleak future on display in Priest is a frightening dystopia in which mankind and vampires have waged war for eons.  What was once a lost cause, the battle-tide turned when Priests, hyper-kinetic humans trained in vampire warfare, began driving vampires back to the darkness of coffins and caves from which they came.  A delicate balance was maintained until Priests were no longer needed, a la superheroes inWatchmen.  When vampires slowly mount their revival amongst the scorns of humanity living outside the church-protected, walled-off cities, it's up to Priest (Paul Bettany) to do his best Van Helsing impersonation.  Along with Priestess (Maggie Q) and Hicks (Cam Gigandet), Priest must stop the ultimate (penultimate?) plan through which the Black Hat (Karl Urban), the vamp leader, plans to deliver his coven to one of the great cities for a vampire version of Thanksgiving feast.  When you watch the final battle, just remember that I told you they should have gotten help from Vin Diesel and Paul Walker; it will make the sequence more enjoyable.Overall the flaws of this movie don't outweigh the positives.  Even if Bettany doesn't exude ""superhero vampire killer"" and Urban can only hide his homogenous facial expressions under the brim shadow of his hat for mere portions of the movie, the acting is solid and the pair did what they could with fairly one-dimensional characters.  The battle sequences avoid the dreaded shaky cam for the most part, and there is plenty of action/gore (i.e. arrows, throwing stars, guns, beheadings, Baysplosions, etc.) for fans of either genre.  One particular kill by Maggie Q (with a razor wire?) literally elicited laughter and applause from my fellow audience members and I.  You'll know which scene; trust me.  The cinematography is fairly impressive.  Sweeping scenes of the Mojave desert serve the film well (note:  I appreciated the first few ""motorcycles riding through the desert""-scenes, I didn't like the other 32.), and the claustrophobia of vampire hiding places works, even if the vampires on meth doesn't follow traditional vampire lore (at least they don't sparkle).  Speaking of problems with the movie, we get it: you hate the Catholic church.  The outright attack on religion is preposterously overbearing.  The controlling clergy has been done numerous times before.  And better.  Most recently in V for Vendetta.  The director probably has some crazy stories from his days as an altar boy.That being said, I enjoyed the film for brainless fun.  The script is minimal and almost immediately gets to the good guys vs. vampires.  Action and intrigue don't let up until the credits roll.  A nod to the graphic novel roots near the beginning of the movie was a nice touch.",4,"A cool, albeit derivative mish-mash of post-apocalyptic, western, vampire movies",1311292800,"07 22, 2011",2011,2799,"['Equal', 'parts', 'post-apocalyptic', 'industrial', 'andMad', 'Maxwasteland', 'bleak', 'future', 'display', 'Priest', 'frightening', 'dystopia', 'mankind', 'vampires', 'have', 'waged', 'war', 'eons', 'What', 'was', 'once', 'lost', 'cause', 'battle-tide', 'turned', 'when', 'Priests', 'hyper-kinetic', 'humans', 'trained', 'vampire', 'warfare', 'began', 'driving', 'vampires', 'back', 'darkness', 'coffins', 'caves', 'came', 'delicate', 'balance', 'was', 'maintained', 'Priests', 'were', 'no', 'longer', 'needed', 'la', 'inWatchmen', 'When', 'vampires', 'slowly', 'mount', 'revival', 'scorns', 'humanity', 'living', 'church-protected', 'walled-off', 'cities', 'up', 'Priest', 'Paul', 'Bettany', 'do', 'best', 'Van', 'Helsing', 'impersonation', 'Priestess', 'Maggie', 'Q', 'Hicks', 'Cam', 'Gigandet', 'Priest', 'must', 'stop', 'ultimate', 'penultimate', 'plan', 'Black', 'Hat', 'Karl', 'Urban', 'vamp', 'leader', 'deliver', 'coven', 'one', 'great', 'cities', 'vampire', 'version', 'Thanksgiving', 'feast', 'When', 'watch', 'final', 'battle', 'just', 'remember', 'told', 'should', 'have', 'gotten', 'help', 'Vin', 'Diesel', 'Paul', 'Walker', 'will', 'make', 'sequence', 'more', 'flaws', 'movie', 'do', ""n't"", 'outweigh', 'positives', 'Even', 'Bettany', ""n't"", 'exude', 'superhero', 'vampire', 'killer', 'Urban', 'can', 'only', 'hide', 'homogenous', 'facial', 'expressions', 'brim', 'shadow', 'hat', 'mere', 'portions', 'movie', 'acting', 'solid', 'pair', 'did', 'what', 'could', 'fairly', 'one-dimensional', 'characters', 'battle', 'avoid', 'dreaded', 'shaky', 'cam', 'most', 'part', 'plenty', 'action/gore', 'i.e', 'arrows', 'throwing', 'stars', 'guns', 'beheadings', 'Baysplosions', 'etc', 'fans', 'genre', 'One', 'particular', 'kill', 'Maggie', 'Q', 'razor', 'wire', 'literally', 'elicited', 'laughter', 'applause', 'fellow', 'audience', 'members', ""'ll"", 'know', 'scene', 'cinematography', 'fairly', 'impressive', 'Sweeping', 'scenes', 'Mojave', 'desert', 'serve', 'film', 'well', 'note', 'appreciated', 'first', 'few', 'motorcycles', 'riding', 'desert', '-scenes', 'did', ""n't"", 'other', '32', 'claustrophobia', 'vampire', 'hiding', 'places', 'even', 'vampires', 'meth', ""n't"", 'follow', 'traditional', 'vampire', 'lore', 'least', 'do', ""n't"", 'sparkle', 'Speaking', 'problems', 'movie', 'get', 'hate', 'Catholic', 'church', 'outright', 'attack', 'religion', 'preposterously', 'overbearing', 'controlling', 'clergy', 'been', 'done', 'numerous', 'times', 'better', 'Most', 'recently', 'V', 'Vendetta', 'director', 'probably', 'crazy', 'stories', 'days', 'altar', 'being', 'said', 'enjoyed', 'film', 'brainless', 'fun', 'script', 'minimal', 'almost', 'immediately', 'good', 'guys', 'vs.', 'vampires', 'Action', 'intrigue', 'do', ""n't"", 'let', 'up', 'credits', 'roll', 'nod', 'graphic', 'novel', 'roots', 'beginning', 'movie', 'was', 'nice', 'touch']",N/A

First off, all the action scenes were pretty awesome, and if it had only been action scenes, with no plot or acting, it would have been a pretty awesome 30 min show. The extreme overly dramatic dialogue scenes, however, felt very forced and out of place. None of the actors were very good, except for maybe Karl Urban, who seemed to be actually going for cheese as opposed to everyone else who seemed to be going for the Academy Award for best drama. It was almost painful to watch any scene with dialogue in it. It really felt like they got a Telemundo director to come in and film all the dialogue scenes. Nobody in their right mind could have edited this film without realizing how absolutely cheesy every dramatic scene was. It seemed to be a parody of itself. If the acting had been even remotely convincing, or if the formula of 70% dramatic dialogue scenes to 30% action scenes had been reversed, this would have been a much better movie. I like some cheesy movies, don't get me wrong, but this was just too much. The music was ridiculous, and it reminded me of the end of Conan the Destroyer, where the dramatic finale music kept playing over and over each time the already dead monster was stabbed by the humorous sidekick. That was intentional cheese and it was funny, albeit stupid. That happened countless times in this movie but it wasn't funny at all, just stupid. So to sum up my review: 30 min of this movie was awesome, the rest of it was some of the worst combination of terrible dramatic acting, horribly cheesy lines and a ridiculously over the top musical score.",2,Daytime Soap Opera...

I wasn't sure quite what to expect from this one. Having watched the trailer, I thought it looked ok but it was pointed out to me by a dear friend that ""You liked Van Helsing, of course you'll love that nonsense.""I enjoy horror, of course I do. I enjoy alternate history horror where artistic license has been taken with real events. Steampunk type adventures interest me too. However, what we have here with Priest is, at its base level, an action movie with a horror aspect rather than vice versa.That is not to say I didn't enjoy it, far from it. As an action movie, I feel it stood up very well and reminded me at various points of a number of movies. The Priests and the setting for this film are effectively Judge Dredd (coincidentally, Karl Urban will be seen as Judge Dredd in 2012's Dredd) , The fight sequences are very much stylised martial arts coreography and the general feel is very much that of a Western. That enough of a mash-up for you?!The vampires in Priest make a nice change from the usual bloodsuckers we see and are certainly far from the angsty sparkly nonsense of certain films. With Priest, the vampires are photosensitive cave dwellers who live in hives. Any human bitten by them either dies or becomes a familiar; they do not turn.The cast here have done very well with the subject matter presented before them. Bettany is compelling as the tortured lead, Maggie Q holds her own as always, Urban is suitably sinister as the villain and Cam Gigandet is believable as the young lawman. However, there was no real depth to the characters and they all presented as very two-dimensional; ironic given that the release of the film was pushed back in order to allow it to be released simultaneously in 3-D; no real surprise since the director really cut his teeth as a Special Effects guy in the biz. There are nice turns from Christopher Plummer and Alan Dale; and horror favourite Brad Dourif turns up for a while too!On a sidenote, Bettany seems to be getting typecast in these holy warrior roles now with Priest, his turn as the archangel Michael in Legion and as the creepy monk Silas in The Da Vinci Code.There is really not much more for me to say about this move other than Priest is let down by a weak script that is used to merely transport the characters from one set piece or massive brawl; but viewing it as an action rather than horror movie, I guess it doesn't have to be the strongest given what it is meant to be; its simply popcorn for your eyes with no real substance.",3,Popcorn action-horror with Priest,1352764800,"11 13, 2012",2012,2774,"['Priest', '2011', 'vampire', 'movie', 'starring', 'Paul', 'Bettany', 'Legion', 'Maggie', 'Q', 'Die', 'Hard', '4.0', 'Mission', 'Impossible', 'III', 'Karl', 'Urban', 'Doom', 'Chronicles', 'Riddick', 'Ghost', 'Ship', 'Cam', 'Gigandet', 'Pandorum', 'Unborn', 'based', 'Korean', 'graphic', 'novel', 'Hyung', 'Min-woo', 'was', ""n't"", 'sure', 'quite', 'what', 'expect', 'one', 'Having', 'watched', 'trailer', 'thought', 'looked', 'ok', 'was', 'pointed', 'out', 'dear', 'friend', 'liked', 'Van', 'Helsing', 'course', ""'ll"", 'love', 'nonsense', 'enjoy', 'horror', 'course', 'do', 'enjoy', 'alternate', 'history', 'horror', 'where', 'artistic', 'license', 'been', 'taken', 'real', 'events', 'Steampunk', 'type', 'interest', 'too', 'However', 'what', 'have', 'here', 'Priest', 'base', 'level', 'action', 'movie', 'horror', 'aspect', 'rather', 'vice', 'versa.That', 'not', 'say', 'did', ""n't"", 'enjoy', 'far', 'action', 'movie', 'feel', 'stood', 'up', 'very', 'well', 'reminded', 'various', 'points', 'number', 'movies', 'Priests', 'setting', 'film', 'are', 'effectively', 'Judge', 'Dredd', 'coincidentally', 'Karl', 'Urban', 'will', 'be', 'seen', 'Judge', 'Dredd', '2012', 'Dredd', 'fight', 'sequences', 'are', 'very', 'much', 'stylised', 'martial', 'arts', 'coreography', 'general', 'feel', 'very', 'much', 'Western', 'enough', 'mash-up', 'vampires', 'Priest', 'make', 'nice', 'change', 'usual', 'bloodsuckers', 'see', 'are', 'certainly', 'far', 'angsty', 'sparkly', 'nonsense', 'certain', 'films', 'Priest', 'vampires', 'are', 'photosensitive', 'cave', 'dwellers', 'who', 'live', 'hives', 'human', 'bitten', 'dies', 'familiar', 'do', 'not', 'turn.The', 'cast', 'here', 'have', 'done', 'very', 'well', 'subject', 'matter', 'presented', 'Bettany', 'compelling', 'tortured', 'lead', 'Maggie', 'Q', 'own', 'always', 'Urban', 'suitably', 'sinister', 'villain', 'Cam', 'Gigandet', 'believable', 'young', 'lawman', 'However', 'was', 'real', 'depth', 'characters', 'all', 'presented', 'very', 'two-dimensional', 'ironic', 'given', 'release', 'film', 'was', 'pushed', 'back', 'order', 'allow', 'be', 'released', 'simultaneously', '3-D', 'real', 'surprise', 'director', 'really', 'cut', 'teeth', 'Special', 'Effects', 'guy', 'biz', 'are', 'nice', 'turns', 'Christopher', 'Plummer', 'Alan', 'Dale', 'horror', 'favourite', 'Brad', 'Dourif', 'up', 'while', 'too', 'sidenote', 'Bettany', 'be', 'getting', 'typecast', 'holy', 'warrior', 'roles', 'now', 'Priest', 'turn', 'archangel', 'Michael', 'Legion', 'creepy', 'monk', 'Silas', 'Da', 'Vinci', 'Code.There', 'really', 'not', 'much', 'more', 'say', 'move', 'other', 'Priest', 'let', 'down', 'weak', 'script', 'used', 'merely', 'transport', 'characters', 'one', 'set', 'piece', 'massive', 'brawl', 'viewing', 'action', 'rather', 'horror', 'movie', 'guess', ""n't"", 'have', 'be', 'strongest', 'given', 'what', 'meant', 'be', 'simply', 'popcorn', 'eyes', 'real', 'substance']",N/A
1308323,A2AVD56NK41OPE,B002ZG98N2,Jonathan Stover,"[0, 8]","If the writing on this movie were a lot better or a lot worse, it could be pretty interesting. However, all dialogue was written by the Dialogamatic 3000, which means that you won't actually hear a line of dialogue you haven't heard a hundred times before in other movies. That's an impressive feat of dialogue writing for a movie set in an alternate, steam-punky universe in which super-powered Catholic priests fight a species of eyeless vampires that look like the reimagined Pig-monster from the rebooted Doom video-game franchise.I'm assuming Paul Bettany, Karl Urban, and Christopher Plummer all had bills to pay. They all do what they can with this amazingly derivative piece of junk, which is not much. Movies this movie rips off for plot, characterization, visuals, set design, and monsters include (but are not limited to!) The Searchers, The Matrix series, Clint Eastwood's Man with No Name trilogy, Blade Runner, The Road Warrior, the Alien movies, Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon, and pretty much the entire steampunk genre.In what must be an alternate universe, thousands of years of war between humanity and vampires (which are not, I repeat, not human, and not derived from humans, a fact the movie doesn't really establish fully until there are only ten minutes left) are seemingly over. The remaining vampires are on reservations, which must have been a hell of a relocation effort given that at no time are the vampires shown as being able to reason, much less talk.They are afraid of the sun, however, which is a good thing given that they don't have eyes, meaning that they know the sun's there when their skin starts burning. These vampires really are nature's cruelest mistake. Move over, Bottomless Pete!The super-powered ninja Catholic Priests who won the Great Vampire War have been decommissioned and given menial jobs, because when you have superpowered people around, it's always a good idea to piss them off by having them clean toilets and shovel coal. The church hierarchy now denies there's any vampire problem. Pretty much everybody lives in walled, smoke-filled cities, though there are settlements out on the endless desert that surrounds these cities. The citizens in the cities all dress like urchins from a road company production of Oliver. They have invented the elevator, the television, and the computer, but not soap or fashion.Oh ho! Vampires kidnap the Paul Bettany Priest character's niece (the only name he gets is Priest, which is really a title, isn't it?) and kill his brother and sister-in-law. Like John Wayne in The Searchers, off he goes. The Church doesn't want him to go, but he goes anyway. Because that's what a man does when vampires kidnap his niece.He knows it's a trap because otherwise the vampires would have just eaten his niece, but he goes anyway. The Church recommissions four other priests to follow him and stop him. He teams up with a young sheriff to hunt the vampires. The vampires, meanwhile, are all riding around on a train headed straight for one of the cities. Or maybe The City.Yes, the villains are all riding around on a train. This makes for a pretty linear chase narrative, as there appears to be only one train line in the whole world. If this civilization had radios, cellphones or even telegraphs, the movie could end around the 45-minute mark. However, this does not appear to be the case.While the city (or The City) is a smoky Blade Runner industrial dystopia, the country appears to be the 1850 Old West with motorbikes instead of horses, but otherwise invested in oldey timey clothes and phonographs and 19th-century cotton dresses. I would love to know how history ended up here, but I'm not sure the writers of either the movie or the comic book know the answer to that any more than I do.Priest instead really seems more like an intentional mash-up of visual styles without any attendant brainpower devoted to figuring out how such visuals could ever have occurred. One shot shows the keen intellect at work here. After Priest intones portentously that there's no sun in the city any more, we see a shot of the city as seen on the horizon. It's no wonder that the city has a smog and smoke problem because its designers didn't invent an industrial district -- instead, there appears to be a gigantic smokestack looming over ever city block. And you thought your city was badly planned!Much chasing of the train ensues on the solar-powered motorbikes everyone seems to ride when they're not riding the train, cars also apparently not having been invented. Also, I can't think of a better vehicle to ride across a rock-strewn wasteland than a motorbike travelling at 300 miles per hour. Can you? Karl Urban shows up, looking pretty much exactly like Clint Eastwood in A Fistful of Dollars. Much CGI ensues.I didn't NOT enjoy Priest. Like Terminator Salvation but at one-tenth the budget, it offers a rich array of swipes, steals and homages to mull over. Okay, laugh over. Paul Bettany struggles manfully to invest his ill-written role with something remotely actorly -- with this and his role in the equally bad and derivative Legion, Bettany is threatening to become the Peter Weller of the 21st century. We know that, like Weller, Bettany can act. But we don't want to see him acting in movies like Priest or Legion (or in Weller's case, Screamers and Shakedown. Note how all these movies have one-word titles?).Christopher Plummer does his old hambone in a bad movie routine, and Karl Urban does about what he can with a character who doesn't even have a proper name or in lieu of that, a title. He's Black Hat. Brad Dourif is Salesman! Maggie Q is Priestess!

1308324,A3N0LBOUQAD1BG,B002ZG98N2,"Jonnathan Ritland ""Hank Peters, Italian Grocer""","[1, 2]","In the future vampires began to overrun the world, the human race retreated into cities protected and looked over by the church. To combat the growing vampire menace a group was created to kill the creatures, a group known as ""Priests"". They had powers and abilities far beyond normal people and thus were able to turn back and destroy most vampires and put the rest into camps of sorts. The priests were then dibanded cause the church felt that the vampires were finished.Of course if that was the case we wouldn't have this movie where a young girl is kidnapped, the local sheriff (Cam Gigandet, ""Pandorum"") rides out to the main city to call upon Priest (Paul Bettany, ""A Beautiful Mind"") to help him rescue the girl (Lily Collins, ""The Blind Side""). When Priest asks the church for help and is refused he breaks his oath and goes out on his own. The church is angered by this and sends a few other priests including a woman ( the incredibly gorgeous Maggie Q, ""Live Free or Die Hard"") to bring him back.Oh and there's also a villain named Black Hat (Karl Urban, ""Doom"") who wants to bring a horde of vampires to the city to massacre the humans and bring about a new way of life. There is also a small role of the head of the church played by Christopher Plummer, who is very typical of many religous types portayed in these type of films. The writing is also very well basic to say the least, not a lot of memorable dialogue though Urban and Bettany seem to have the most fun with their roles.sIts not a terrible movie, the visuals are impressive, though the creatures a bit typical looking. The cast is also good though the acting is passable, cept for Bettany who is always good no matter the material. The religious undertones become a bit much, which is a lot like ""Legion"" another film Bettany starred in, however ""Priest"" is miles better than that film.

Although the 3D added to the visual effects of weapons flying through the air and things exploding, I think you can enjoy the movie without it.  It is about 1  hours long and is adequately entertaining.We begin in the Sola Mira Hive (a huge bee-hive looking home for vampires in the rocks).  The Priests are on a search-and-destroy mission when one of their own is taken away, screaming.  Fast-forward many years and we learn The Priests were a group of elite trained vampire killers, working for the Church.  Their skills were unsurpassed and the vamps didn't have a chance against The Priests.  (Priests 5, Vamps 0)Now, in a futuristic post-war society (as another reviewer put it - a ""Mad Max"" type landscape), the remaining vamps have long ago been herded away and locked into a big determent camp.  Since the Church no longer needed The Priests after The Great War with the vamps, the Priests became outcasts of society.  Meanwhile, we hear ""The church protects you"" being broadcast to the people in the streets as they go along with their daily lives.In Sector 12, a family sits down to dinner as they hear a thundering noise coming toward them in the night.  It seems the vamps have been pro-creating like crazy and are breaking out into society again.  They do their vamp thing and grab the young daughter, Lucy.This is really where the story begins.  The family man is The Priest's brother.  The local sheriff is another brother.  The head vamp is not a bad looking Dirty Harry type guy (for a vamp that is) and he has grabbed Lucy because he wants The Priest to come after him.  So, think of this as a vamp coming-out party.An interesting sub-power-play is with The Church. Comprised of a board of about 5 Monsignors, the lead of which is Christoper Plummer, is reluctant to reinstate The Priest because The Church has told all the locals they are safe and does not want to admit the people are NOT safe.  They forbid The Priest to go after Lucy stating that ""To go against the church is to go against God!""  The Priest is hoping to get his relative back, before the vamps ""turn her"".Paul Bettany does a good job in his role as The Priest.  The movie is a little bloody.  Most of the vamps are weird looking.  Lots of CGI and some of that fly-through-the-air fighting.  The movie definitely makes way for a part II.It's a decent movie, but not my bag.

1308349,A4SY5RCGC5CH9,B002ZG98N2,"Maciej ""Darth Maciek""","[0, 0]","I was curious about this film and I really wanted to like it - but it proved to be simply impossible... Below, more of my impressions, with some limited SPOILERS.This film was based on a very original South Korean comic and therefore it was clear, that visual aspects would have to be the main asset - but it never means that one has to sacrify completly the scenario and especially the dialogs... Here, very sadly, it was exactly what happened and therefore if visually this film has many merits, the scenario, the dialogs and character development are beneath everything...So, to get the story out of the way. In an alternate reality humans and vampires always shared the world and of course always were at war, as the latter considered the former mostly as source of food and occasionally also slave material. In this reality vampires are not undead monsters - they are living creatures, not exactly humanoid (they rather look like bears without fur and with gray skin) and they are devoided of eyes but clearly have some other senses unknown to man. They live in hives like termites and possess a collective mind, with the secretive Queens of the Hive being the supreme authority (albeit few people ever saw one and lived to describe it).The vampires from this film are killed by sunlight, feed on human blood and with their bites are able to enslave people (those thralls are called Familiars) - but otherwise they are quite obviously very different from &#34;classical&#34; vampires. They do not fear crosses or holy water - on another hand they are vulnerable to regular weapons, but it is difficult to hit them because of their speed and they are also so powerfully build, that it takes a lot of effort to efficiently destroy one...The war of humanity against the vampires was very long and it devastated the whole panet. It was ultimately won by humanity after the appearance of elite warriors, called Priests. Defeated, the vampires had to sue for peace and were allowed to keep a part of wastelands as their reservation. Humanity mostly retreated to the cities, under the totalitarian control of the Church (it is supposedly a Christian Church, but not necessarily exactly the Catholic Church as we know it). Some free humans survive also in small towns in the wastelands. Priests are no more really needed, therefore they do other work for the Church - but most of them are not very happy with their existence.All of this is explained in the short and fast introduction and then the story begins, with a Priest (Paul Bethany) receiving alarming news about a possible vampire raid (the first in many, many years) against a human settlement - the one in which his brother Owen lives with his wife Shannon and daughter Lucy (Lily Collins). The news are brought by sheriff Hicks (Cam Gigandet) who was courting Lucy already for some time... Against the orders of Monsignor Orelas (Christopher Plummer), local leader of the Church, the Priest joins Hicks and leaves the city to look into this whole business and especially check if the raid was really the work of vampires... Later, a Priestess (Maggie Q) will also join the team... I will not say more about the story.This could have been a reasonably good fantasy adventure film, but sadly it is not the case. As I already said, the scenario is poor, dialogs are lame, there is no humour and honestly, the story mostly doesn't make any sense, as people keep doing stupid things for no reason at all. The most illogical decisions are those taken by Monsignor Orelas who obviously is one of the bad guys, but I will be darned if I understand why...The only thing that is honest in this film is the casting. Paul Bettany does all right as a taciturn holy warrior and it was a nice joke to make Cam Gigandet play a vampire hunter considering that he is for the moment mostly known as James the Sadistic Vampire from &#34;Twilight&#34; - but it is Maggie Q who does the best job in this film as Priestess, hopelessly (and so obviously) in love with the Priest...))) Christopher Plummer is of course a great actor and it is a pleasure to watch him, even if the actions of his character do not make the slightest sense. Lily Collins is a cute damsel in distress, Karl Urban plays the mysterious Black Hat, a guy who may or may not be in cahoots with the vampires and Brad Dourif makes a cameo as... well, the kind of guy who is usually played by Brad Dourif...))) But even this good casting can not save this film.Bottom line, notwithstanding the presence of good actors, this film is a disappointment and I am glad that I rented rather than bought it.

Better than most for this category.What it lacks in plot creativity or complexity - the filmmakers and cast made up for in earnest effort, crisp cinematography, and very decent sfx.'Priest' tells the story of a war that was thought won long ago. A war against vampires. After the downfall of society, the Church is recast as humanity's savior by bringing forth their specially trained foot soldiers - The Priests. It's their effort that turns back the vampiric tide and ultimately wins the battle. The order then sets out to rebuild out of the ruins, bringing life to the mega-cities that house the remainder of 'civilized' people, protected from the ravaged and desiccated wastelands that sadly comprise the remainder of the planet. And having preserved humankind, the religious hierarchy took over as complete and absolute rulers. Ironically, no longer relevant in this new safe world - The Priests themselves are retired.Until one priest learns of an outlander family that is murdered. One he knows well - it's his family. Unusual because most priests are selected as very young children and spend the remainder of their lives training for the day that they might be called to duty; they have no memory of any family outside of the church. However, his story differs significantly because he was taken as a young adult. The order recognized in him innate abilities that weren't discovered until he was well past the age where most recruits are taken; those latent skills were tremendous, a quantum leap beyond other acolytes. He becomes the ultimate Priest, the pinnacle of their training embodied into a focused weapon of precision.And he's going to find out who's responsible for his kinfolk being butchered, no matter what it takes. Even if it means breaking his vow of obedience. Even if he has to wipe out other priests who are ordered to stop his heretical actions. But what he doesn't expect is being forced to confront his past, in more ways than one.Based on some of the tomato and film fan reviews I briefly scoped out, I suspect a huge turnoff was the use of The Cross. Lemmings have been taught via rote and mimic to find Christianity as inherently bad and/or misguided. While I'm not going to get baited into an argument about theology, as a movie fan I do find it unsettling that so many are led by the nose via the entertainment industry; ""learning"" their world view without actually doing the hard work of discovering it for themselves. Sadly typical of the laziness inherent in so many people today.A popcorn flick that makes for a decent filler while waiting for the blockbuster or important film releases.Personal Notes:- Loved the jet-powered motorcycles. I've seen several real-life versions of this and each one looks about as ridable as a rabid bat out of hell, pretty much self-induced widowmakers. This flick is about as close as I would want to get to one. The subsequent vicarious woody seeing them tear across open desert, even if it's about as real as spaceships going faster than light speed, was enough of a ride.- Paul Bettany has been such an excellent addition to so many film projects. Unfortunately, in this particular garb and make-up, there's more than a bit of the Albino from 'The Da Vinci Code' echoed in his performance. I suppose that's unavoidable given the general framework of the story. But I still had a difficult time trying to shake it from memory. Obviously the standard colors when doing dystopia are black, muted brown and flat gray. However, to move his character away from that previous performance, perhaps going with a costume of navy blue and gold highlights; something to individualize and step-away from Silas.Also, when I watch the man, I often wonder if there's a production that will finally reveal what I perceive is a potential superstar in the making. I've seen him teeter on the brink of becoming a serious contending lead actor - all he needs is that one role that'll catapult him to instant recognition. But on the other hand, he might just be too distinguished to cast, very much in the Willem Dafoe vein.- Ditto my thoughts on Karl Urban. Though admittedly he's earned himself spots on several high-profile projects over the years - most notably in the recently rebooted 'Star Trek' franchise. I've been a fan for quite some time, and am particularly enamored of his performance as the Russian FSB agent in the second Bourne film. Had high hopes that some producer might see the potential and do a movie based on his character Kirill.

1308353,A2DAHERP7HYJGO,B002ZG98N2,Mark Turner,"[1, 1]","It seems only natural that Hollywood has sought out new sources of inspiration for movies. They've sequelized and remade just about everything under the sun. So when word got out that they were taking a manga (Japanese comic) story and turning it into film, fans were both glad to hear it and concerned if they were dedicated to the original source. For those of us unaccustomed to it, the film is pure entertainment.The future is a bleak one. The battle between humans and vampires escalated to the point where the world was nearly destroyed in the aftermath. These vampires are unlike those seen in most stories, less suave and sophisticated and more along the lines of faceless monsters with gaping jaws.To win the war the clergy created a new force to be reckoned with, the Priests. Raised to battle these demons and with abilities greater than most men, the Priests set out to destroy the vampires and nearly did so, trapping any that remained in sealed areas of the world. But the world that was left was just as decimated, comprised of cities surrounded by walks and ruled by the Church. The Priests were disbanded with their being no need for them any longer. Until now.In one of the settlements outside the city, a lone cabin stands and the inhabitants are set upon by a rampaging army of vampires. There are two survivors. One is a young woman who was captured by the vampires. The other her father, the brother of the Priest who stood out above the rest (Paul Bettany). With revenge in mind and warning the Church of this mounting army he asks to be reinstated. But the leaders refuse to believe there is any danger and not only deny him reinstatement but tell him to stand down or be hunted.Priest (as he is called) ignores their threats and heads out to find the vampires and rescue his niece. In turn the Church reinstates several members of the Priests and sends them out to capture him, dead or alive.Accompanied by his niece' boyfriend and Sheriff Hicks (Cam Gigandet), Priests tracks the vampires to their lair. What he discovers is far more dangerous than he imagined. There is not just a small group of vampires comprising an army but thousands. And they are led by Black Hat (Karl Urban), a former Priest turned vampire and friend to Priest, lost during one of their battles against the scourge.Black Hat has taken over a train and filled it with the vampires as well as his captive. With only the help of a fellow Priest and Hicks, Priest sets out to end this once and for all. And no one, including the Church, will stop him.If the story sounds familiar, yes it does seem like a retelling of the movie THE SEARCHERS. So I guess it isn't as original as we can hope for. But the film does put a nice twist on both the heroes and villains seen in movies of this sort. The vampires are monstrous creatures while the Priests are ninja like warriors having more in common with Crusaders than with current members of the clergy.The movie looks spectacular, mostly taking place at night and yet shot in such a way that everything is visible. Too many movies like this choose total blackness but this movie gives us a good view of the action and the characters. The special effects are top notch as well both physically and animated. The creatures seem real and the explosions, etc. are well done.Bettany has changed since we first saw him years ago. Where he once played various geek type roles he's taken on the mantle of action star and it suits him well. Gigandet seems to be everywhere since his big role in TWILIGHT. This movie can only be another notch on his belt.The movie may not be for everyone but for action and sci-fi/fantasy fans it will offer them everything they could hope for. This isn't a spoiler but the end of the film does leave an opening for another and one can only hope that it does well enough on DVD that the studio follows through.

1308354,A3HBE3VAKQ7RYF,B002ZG98N2,"Megan @ Book Brats ""Book Brats Reviews""","[1, 3]","I watched this movie for one reason - I might have something of an addiction to Karl Urban.  I love Karl Urban and will watch anything he's been in.  I finally got a hold of Priest and grew suddenly wary that maybe this movie was going to be so atrocious that I'd fall asleep or turn off.  Well, while I was disappointed that such a high concept and awesome set design were wasted on horrible dialogue and horrible acting from almost every single cast member, I wasn't totally turned off.This movie has a lot going for it.  Great cast, interesting plot, amazing visuals.  What it doesn't have going for it, though, is solid writing and good acting.  Paul Bettany's only emotion for the entire movie was ""GRRRRR!"" Karl Urban brought something to the table, but I was honestly more focused on his fangs and attempt at a Southern accent than I was on his delivery.  But the dialogue...  Oh dear jeebus the dialogue.  The lines were campy, cruddy, and unbelievable at the same time.PRIEST seems like some great homage to ALIENS, except with vampires instead of aliens.  The set design for the vampire hive seems like LV-426 all over again, and the vampire cocoons were like the eggs we see in the Alien series.  On top of a vampire queen and a character named Hicks who basically serves the same purpose as Hicks from ALIENS, I couldn't get past that.  I did enjoy the dystopian elements of the story, though, particularly the fact it seemed like a Catholic version of EQUILIBRIUM with the city sets reminiscent of DARK CITY.  The movie was by no means bad on the eyes.  It was just bad on the part of your movie going soul that wants quality acting.My verdict: good sets, baaaaaad acting and dialogue.  This movie could have been so much better if handled by a better screenwriter.  The ending was also a big letdown.  I'm curious to know more, but don't really care either way.

1308357,A3PPXVR5J6U2JD,B002ZG98N2,"Michael J. Tresca ""Talien""","[1, 1]","""Priest"" is a post-apocalyptic western, in the vein of movies like ""Mad Max"" and ""The Book of Eli"" and video games like Fallout and Borderlands. Only it has vampires instead of mutants, motorbikes instead of horses, and the Catholic church instead of the law. In a time when vampires sparkle and Western movies are rare, Priest's premise has an uphill battle to win audiences over.The story begins with a flashback to Priest (Paul Bettany) recruited by sheriff Hicks (Cam Gigandet).  Priest's brother Owen (Stephen Moyer) was mortally wounded in a vampire attack.  The brothers' relationship is complicated -- they shared a love interest in Shannon (Madchen Amick), Priest's former lover and Owen's wife, who died in the attack.  Only Priest's niece, Lucy (Lily Collins), survived.In the ""Priest"" universe vampires are skittering, drooling, faceless monstrosities -- just jaws and fangs.  They turn humans into subservient ""familiars"" to guard their hives.  These vampires are more like ""Aliens'"" xenomorphs, complete with a queen and hive guardians.The Priests are the equivalent of Dungeons & Dragons-style paladins, deadly monastic warriors capable of laying waste to vampires.  Priest cannot simply act on his own but mask for permission from the Clergy, who deny his request. Priest goes against the wishes of Monsignor Orelas (Christopher Plummer) to track down Lucy, Orelas sends Priests to track down Priest. The Priests are led by Priestess (the delectable Maggie Q, subdued here). Whew, that's a lot of Priests. Get all that?The villain turns out to be a guy called Black Hat (Karl Urban).  That's it.  That's his name.  Black Hat.  He's a familiar who was once a Priest.  Secrets about Lucy and Black Hat are revealed, vampires are killed in slow-mo 3D, and it all culminates on a battle atop a moving train.As a post-apocalyptic setting, ""Priest"" is a little too bland to distinguish itself.  The vampires come across as animals incapable of plotting anything so sinister as to be a threat to the Church hierarchy and since we never see them communicate we have to take Black Hat's word for it.  Black Hat is a typical vampire sans sunburn, which sets him apart in the ""Priest"" universe but not in the vampire genre.Artistically, this is probably the closest the monolithic hierarchy of Warhammer 40,000 will ever be seen on the big screen. ""Priest's"" comic roots are clear in the design of everything from the sprawling metropolises to the tattooed cross on each Priest's face.As an engaging film, ""Priest"" is far too interested in balletic shots of people getting shot.  Seeing the film at home is disappointing because it's obvious the movie was meant for 3D and a good 30 percent of what happens on screen is meant to be viewed in that fashion.  Without those special effects, ""Priest"" falls flat.As a Western, ""Priest"" hits all the right notes.

Everything in between, such as story coherence and character development, are thrown out the window in favor of slow-motion action scenes with some pretty crummy CGI effects to boot.  Bettany delivers his lines with enough gusto, but everyone else from Karl Urban to Maggie Q to even poor Christopher Plummer slumming it along, don't seem as interested.

Annoying, but hardly surprising.  Yes, some of the dialogue is very cliche - and Paul Bettany does a bit of Clint Eastwood growling of his lines.  Yes the action is over the top unrealistic at times. If this bothers you, you may want to note that vampires don't actually exist and therefore you can check your sense of realism at the door. The visuals are the best part, the script is a bit weak.I don't understand the people saying Bettany is wooden or that they don't understand the motivations of the characters, they must not have been paying attention.  the Priest character is just heavily burdened by his obligation to a church that thanks him for his service and wishes he would just go ahead and die now, along with all of the Priest warriors and is torn between loyalty to it and his former family, which he had to abandon in order to become a Proest in the first place.  The actors were all well chosen, I found Christopher Plummer's Hierophant type character the most dispensable, but I'm not sure that's the actor's fault, the character is pretty much unlikeable. I did find myself occasionally wishing like Salt they had changed the whole focus of the movie to female, called it Priestess and shifted Maggie Q to center stage.just a side note, was there a single human being who didn't see the preview moment where the familiar human says, ""you don't know what's coming, Priest"" and then a vamp jumps onto the screen? that could have been a very cool and effective shocking moment if it hadn't been broadcast ad nauseum beforehand.

The plot's not much to write about (based on a series of graphic novels:Priest: Genesis - Volumes 1-3), but the visual interpretation is at times nearly breathtaking on the big screen (especially in 3D).  The priests are a special cadre of warriors commissioned by The Church (the new world's governing body) to hunt down and eradicate vampires in the land.  According to the comic book-style animated backstory, they accomplished their mission and were disbanded.  But wait, not so fast.  Despite The Church's unexplained objections and denials, there may be vampire trouble brewing outside the protective walls of the cities.  One priest renounces his vows to save a girl held captive by the marauding beasts.This is a world that looks like Utah's stark salt flats without life or greenery, but with lots of space where one can really zip around on super-cool jet-powered motorcycles.  The cities are grotesque gothic masses of steel and randomly placed video screens straight out of a monochrome version ofBlade Runner - The Final Cut (Two-Disc Special Edition).  The sets are stark and at the same time fantastic.  One feels the clausterphobia and despair of a world without natural light or color.  The CGI set designers seemed to take great care in developing a convincing post-apocalyptic wasteland, but the results are uneven.  Adding in great amounts of detail in some scenes (3D dust particles, stunning lighting effects) is very impressive with its realism, only to be followed by a scene that seemed blurry, monochromatic, and feeling incomplete.  Overall, the visual sets and effects are easily the most impressive part of the film.Paul Bettany is convincing as a supercharged yet tortured vampire killer who gave up a shot at a normal existence (well, as normal an existence could be with vampires roaming the open plains) in order to dedicate his life to culling vampire herds and protecting mankind.  Not much emotional range is needed for the role, but Bettany does a decent job of infusing it with some humanity.  Cam Gigandet plays a squinty wild west-style gunslinger/sheriff bent on saving his girl.  He's good with his knife but better with his gun (so he says).  His character (and how Gigandet plays him) seems more of an annoyance to The Priest (and to the audience as well).  Karl Urban steals his every scene with a deliciously snarling performance of a former priest gone bad.  Maggie Q stoically kicks but while trying to hide her not-so-priestess-y feelings for our hero.  The performance, while they won't be in line for Oscar consideration, are strong enough to carry the relatively weak story and drive the action.The action is propulsive, albeit sometimes disjointed and difficult to follow in the vampire combat scenes.  Not to worry, there's plenty of gory death and dismemberment for the mutants, which leads to this question:  What does it take for a movie to get an ""R"" rating these days?  There were amputations, decapitations, combustions, explosions, lacerations, and lots and lots of blood.  Throw in a single ""F""-word and they must've given the MPAA more than a few fits.  I had to recheck my ticket to verify I'd actually seen a PG-13 feature.  Sure enough, but still hard to believe.  Anyway, it certainly satisfied the film's action quotient.One aspect that may offend some viewers is that there seems to be open season on the Catholic church.  The film makes no bones about its scorn for all things religious, especially if religion is used (in a paraphrase of Karl Marx) as the opiate of the masses.  Christopher Plummer's immense talent is wasted as the control-minded monsignor of the church's highest office.  He wails mantras through ubiquitous video screens to the city's public mind-numbingly plodding through the streets, obviously attempting to overtly brain wash.  ""To turn against the church is to turn against God"" must be repeated 20 times in the film.  We get what you're saying.  Move on.  Alan Dale's considerable acting chops are also squandered as he plays Plummer's right-hand monsignor.  There was hope for what could have been a fantastic plot twist (a mole in the highest court) that never developed as his character took the wide path that leads to destruction, one of more than a few missed screenwriting opportunities.But that's not necessarily why one watches a vampire-slayer movie.  It's that kind of poor screenwriting that kept this film from being something really special and memorable.  Instead, it's relegated to the class of effective but flawed genre film.The bottom line is:  I still liked it.  I'd recommend ""Priest"" to anyone who likes films in the genre likeBladeorUnderworld (Widescreen Special Edition).",4,Blade Meets Aliens In Mad Max Land,1305244800,"05 13,

1308378,A2JFKSHR0WQB8C,B002ZG98N2,QuickSilverSeven,"[9, 12]","Priest the movie in 3D is a fairly entertaining, dark action film. Set in a post apocalyptic desert overrun with mutant monster vampires, there's plenty of good action with Paul Bettany as Priest, who sets out against the Church's orders, to rescue a captive girl taken by Karl Urban (Lord of the Rings, Doom) as the human vampire ring leader. After doing so, the Bishop sends out a crew of Priests, including the well fighting Maggie Q, to capture Priest.The action scenes include on foot fighting, with plenty of sharp blades and throwing 'stars' to slice up the mindless drone vampires. If you're an action fan, this is definitely worth a rental or purchase. The action is well done and easy to follow thanks to good camera work that allows the actors space to breath, and well done choreography of Priest fighting monsters and human vampires. There's also a lot of time spent on futuristic hover cycles and a good ending cycle/train chase.The setting takes place in the desert, and mostly during the day, with night scenes either underground or in the town. Action occurs in a giant cave, infested town, in/on a train, desert...The rescue quest plot was a bit basic but interesting. Could've been so much more though.Story aside, the 3D was really well done considering it's post converged, which is actually getting quite good these days when done right (Also see Thor 3D). One highlight of the 3D is it really pops in depth, so there's no wondering whether you should be wearing 3D glasses or just watch it in 2D. There's a clear and strong difference. Every other scene pops 3D.So if you're a fan of Blade or Mad Max, I'd recommend this film.

It's really one of those films that elicits an ""Ehhhh"" when asked, ""How was that?"" There was a lot that was done well...the world seemed very dark and sad...and yet, at the same time, too much like a video game (all I kept thinking of were the wastelands from Fallout). Possibly the best part of this movie was reuniting Grima and Eomer in film -- Brad Dourif and Karl Urban; and, yes, that really has absolutely nothing to do with the film...there just isn't enough that's awesome about this to outshine that bit of nerd trivia.By the same token, there's not too much that is awful about it either. The super human jumping/acrobatics were a little off-putting, and the animated intro seemed out of place. That, though, was really the extent of the bad. The rest was just shrug worthy, ""ehhh"" inducing mediocrity. I personally think this would have been a lot better as an anime, where the world, the eye-less vampires and the less-than-realistic combat would have all been part of a stylized art form.The story (spoilers) takes place in a world where the vampires, once destroyers of the human race, have been driven into reservations by the powerful warrior class of Priests. Fearful of the power of that class, the church disbands the Priests, sending them out into the world to make their own way; they struggle through, doing their best though their lack of ""regular"" job experience and their strange past makes life difficult, until one of the main character Priest's relatives is kidnapped, his brother fatally wounded, and his former sweetheart murdered -- by vampires. The Priest, against the explicit orders of the Church, which is fearful of arousing panic, sets out to find her. Along the way, he uncovers a plot that threatens to destroy all of mankind.(end spoilers)The story, like the film itself, is neither incredible nor deplorable. If made into a more compelling film, it would have seemed a lot better, I think; and, if made into a worse one, a lot worse. As it is, I think this is a fair film...don't expect a masterpiece, and you won't be disappointed. 3/5 stars, for a decent if not exceptional vampire movie; if for no other reason, this one is worth watching because they've finally put out a movie where the vampires aren't dreamy romantics.",3,Ehhh...,1314057600,"08 23, 2011",2011,2369,"['watched', 'film', 'last', 'night', 'still', 'have', ""n't"", 'decided', 'liked', 'more', 'disliked', 'really', 'one', 'films', 'Ehhhh', 'when', 'asked', 'How', 'was', 'was', 'lot', 'was', 'done', 'well', 'world', 'seemed', 'very', 'dark', 'sad', 'yet', 'same', 'time', 'too', 'much', 'video', 'game', 'kept', 'thinking', 'were', 'wastelands', 'Fallout', 'Possibly', 'best', 'part', 'movie', 'was', 'reuniting', 'Grima', 'Eomer', 'film', 'Brad', 'Dourif', 'Karl', 'Urban', 'yes', 'really', 'absolutely', 'nothing', 'do', 'film', 'there', 'just', ""n't"", 'enough', 'awesome', 'outshine', 'bit', 'nerd', 'same', 'token', 'not', 'too', 'much', 'awful', 'super', 'human', 'jumping/acrobatics', 'were', 'little', 'off-putting', 'animated', 'intro', 'seemed', 'place', 'though', 'was', 'really', 'extent', 'bad', 'rest', 'was', 'just', 'shrug', 'worthy', 'ehhh', 'inducing', 'mediocrity', 'personally', 'think', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'lot', 'better', 'anime', 'where', 'world', 'eye-less', 'vampires', 'less-than-realistic', 'combat', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'part', 'stylized', 'art', 'form.The', 'story', 'spoilers', 'place', 'world', 'where', 'vampires', 'once', 'destroyers', 'human', 'race', 'have', 'been', 'driven', 'reservations', 'powerful', 'warrior', 'class', 'Priests', 'Fearful', 'power', 'class', 'church', 'Priests', 'sending', 'out', 'world', 'make', 'own', 'way', 'struggle', 'doing', 'best', 'lack', 'regular', 'job', 'experience', 'strange', 'past', 'life', 'difficult', 'one', 'main', 'character', 'Priest', 'relatives', 'kidnapped', 'brother', 'fatally', 'wounded', 'former', 'sweetheart', 'murdered', 'vampires', 'Priest', 'explicit', 'orders', 'Church', 'fearful', 'arousing', 'panic', 'out', 'find', 'way', 'plot', 'destroy', 'mankind', 'end', 'spoilers', 'story', 'film', 'incredible', 'deplorable', 'made', 'more', 'compelling', 'film', 'would', 'have', 'seemed', 'lot', 'better', 'think', 'made', 'worse', 'one', 'lot', 'worse', 'think', 'fair', 'film', 'do', ""n't"", 'expect', 'masterpiece', 'wo', ""n't"", 'be', 'disappointed', '3/5', 'stars', 'decent', 'not', 'exceptional', 'vampire', 'movie', 'other', 'reason', 'one', 'worth', 'watching', ""'ve"", 'finally', 'put', 'out', 'movie', 'where', 'vampires', 'are', ""n't"", 'dreamy', 'romantics']",N/A

1308383,A2EDZH51XHFA9B,B002ZG98N2,"Robert Beveridge ""xterminal""","[5, 13]","&lt;strong>Priest&lt;/strong> (Scott Charles Stewart, 2011)The idea that an American director could take a manga running sixteen volumes (when being turned into anime, the rule of thumb is one half-hour episode per manga chapter, there are usually 8-12 manga chapters per graphic novel) and turn it into a ninety-minute feature film was ludicrous from the outset. Even condensing the first volume into a ninety-minute film would have slashed way too much material. But I shouldn't have worried; Scott Charles Stewart's worthless movie has as much to do with Min-woo Hyung's manga as Hyung's work has to do with &lt;em>Blood&lt;/em>, the gruesomely amusing 1997 computer game that served as Hyung's original inspiration. In other words: there are some kind-of similarities, but the plot, the characters, and even the setting are different to the point that one wonders why the licensing fee got paid in the first place.Plot: the unnamed hero (&lt;em>Legion&lt;/em>'s Paul Bettany) is a former member of a vampire-hunting squad who were disbanded after the vampire wars and ordered to integrate themselves into society as best they could. This has proved, shall we say, difficult. (&lt;em>First Blood&lt;/em> this movie is not.) All that changes when his brother Owen (&lt;em>True Blood&lt;/em>'s Stephen Moyer) and sister-in-law (&lt;em>Twin Peaks&lt;/em>' Madchen Amick) are killed in a vampire attack, and his niece Lucy (&lt;em>The Blind Side&lt;/em>'s Lily Collins) abducted. The monsignor who runs Priest-related activities in the megalopolis where our hero lives (Christopher Plummer, slumming it) forbids him to go investigate after the local sheriff, Hicks (&lt;em>Easy A&lt;/em>'s Cam Gigandet), brings him news of the attacks. (Here's my first major ""this script is dumb"" question: why didn't Bettany's character just say he wanted to go attend their funerals?) Granted, it would be short movie if he obeyed, so you know he's going to go off and do what he wants. And when he gets there, he finds out that maybe the vampire wars aren't quite as over as the Church would have people believe.I spent a good deal of time wondering how Scott, whose previous film (&lt;em>Legion&lt;/em>) was just as big a mess as this, managed to con so many really good actors into appearing in this. Plummer, Brad Dourif, Amick, Josh Wingate, Gigandet, these are not people who need the money that badly (I hope). They are far too good for this film, and the best that can be said of any of them save Gigandet is that their roles are too small for them to truly embarrass themselves here. (Gigandet does that all on his own; he's normally quite good, but here he's just as bad as Bettany or main antagonist Karl Urban.) But why am I talking about acting? Here's a new rule of thumb I'm proposing: if you check the movie's IMDB page and the special effects team is larger than the entire cast, the movie sucks because its writer, director, and (most importantly) producers spent far more time thinking about the special effects than they did such niceties as plot, characterization, or pacing.This is a mess.

If he has to take down a horde of crazed, rampaging blood-suckers along the way, so be it.I liked this often-uneven film; Priest's faith was fascinating set against a corrupt world and a manipulative church.  Just like the real world!  Many fine visuals marked otherwise lackluster underground scenes.  I liked the obvious homage to John Wayne's best movie THE SEARCHERS.

You are sick and tired of emotionally weepy and angsty Tween Vampire love stories, and long for the days when bloodsuckers had more bite than bark? Then look no further, the movie ""Priest"" will give you all the thrills, chills, action, and bloody neck bites that you crave in a vampire flick. In a post-apocalyptic future world where vampires and humans have waged wars against each other for centuries, the Church is now Big Brother and controls the lives of the remaining surviving humans with an iron fist. Priests are now, or at least were, trained in the deadly arts of vampire eradication. Years of bloody warfare between vampires and humans have brought about the near total destruction of each race and the planet itself, and now the last remaining humans live in gloomy, drab fortified cities, and the vampires survive out in the decrepit, desolate parts of the planet in shanty towns and reservations. One day, the Sheriff (Cam Gigandet) from a small town in the desert outlying the main city visits a Priest (Paul Bettany) and informs him that the priest's brother and family has been attacked by vampires, and that he needs his help in finding their kidnapped daughter, the Priest's niece. And so it goes that the hunt for the vampires begins.""Priest"" is a stylish post-apocalyptic action/adventure vampire movie that is reminiscent of an old western movie, mixed in with a little bit of Mad Max Road Warrior, and other similar type movies. But instead of cowboys versus indians, it's cowboys versus vampires! A lot of the designs, visuals and storyline of this film are based on those old spaghetti westerns that starred Clint Eastwood. Even the lead vampire, Black Hat, played by Karl Urban, wears an outfit very much similar to the ones that Clint wore in a few of his biggest hits.So, the Priest, along with the Sheriff, head out into the dangerous wastelands of the unforgiving desert to find the missing girl.I really had a good time viewing this movie, more than I thought that I would. I remember when it came to movie theaters back last summer sometime and I opted out on not seeing it, but now I am kind of kicking myself for not having done so.

Yarbrough""","[2, 4]","Though this movie has Cam Gigandet (James from Twilight) and a cameo by Stephen Moyer (Bill from True Blood) there are no shiny vampires for the girls to ooh and ahh over in Priest.  This story is about an order of Priests who were trained by the church to kill vampires and end the war with the undead.  Vampires were rounded up and put into a camp, while the church reigns supreme and is looking after the human race.However, when a family is attacked by vampires, a Priest who is related to the family goes rogue and sets out for battle.  He is joined by Hicks, the sheriff of a town, and eventually teams up with another Priest who had been sent by the church to hunt him down.Based on a graphic novel, the movie has a nice dark comic feel to it, especially in the opening scenes which are shown completely in cartoon. The religious tones to the movie are a bit upstaged by all the intense action.  The Priest kicks butt!  Other than their leader, the vampires are just these strange white slimey monsters and other than fighting and killing, there isn't much interaction.While it has a futuristic feel to it, the movie actually takes place in the past before humans became vampires. The darkness and action were cool, but its hard to connect with the characters - especially since Priest and Black Hat (the lead villain) don't have real names.  The other Priests who were sent to hunt down the outlaw Priest also don't see much air time and their story line is cut pretty short, revealing how powerful Black Hat is but still falling short as far as the overall plot goes.The A-ha! moment comes when the identity of Black Hat is revealed and ties everything together, but the ending is literally left wide open for a sequel so there isn't much closure here.

This essentially is the kind of movie you will see. Something that is more a combination of stuff you have already seen, and often times done better, than a departure into new territory. Don't get me wrong. In the end I enjoyed watching Priest, and root for it's move to a television series, but I still call it as I see it. How do I see it? First off my mash-up for Priest is it's a cross between the better aspects of Judge Dredd, the weaker aspects of Blade, and the best of what's out there for post apocalyptic movies.In an alternate reality our common enemy from it seems the beginning of time are beast like vampires. In this world there were no Draculas or other human vampires throughout this conflict. Just eyeless monsters. The movie picks up after the end of this never ending war where all of the vampires have been either eradicated or confined to reservations by warrior priests with a supernatural gift for combat. Now that the war is over the Church is in control and are getting overconfident over their victory by disbanding the warrior priests. Vampires are coming back in force and our titular Priest (Paul Bettany) defies the Church to save those close to him.First and foremost Priest's shining jewel is in the world created in the film. It's both familiar and so very different at the same time. Large dystopian cities run by a single theocracy are brimming with Orwellian propaganda and industrial excess. Towns and villages outside theocratic rule ooze that dusty, makeshift wasteland style without taking away the realism of such shanty towns. The vampire reservation (prison) and old hive are both exotic in their own way while still showing enough functionality to not dismiss the sets as merely props for the story to move in and out of. All in all this universe is extremely interesting and a place I would like to revisit or spend more time exploring.While the setting is fantastic your walk though it leaves much to be desired. There are a lot of missed opportunities to raise this film to a much higher level. A level I feel would have been worthy of the world that was build around. Church rule, for instance, has such a wide palate of options to show what life is like under such rule, but the road taken was a rather blunt and one dimensional way to go about it. The new threat to mankind, played by Karl Urban, was by all rights a classic twist to the established lore. However with all the potential to rock this world's foundations we are left with uninspiring exposition and simply a bad guy to fight the good guy. The whole film has examples of such wasted potential. Including some specific dialog that should have lead to a satisfying element just screaming to be put in an action sequence. A more subtle hand in the direction of the film would have made what is just a pretty good film turn into a great film.I think the biggest problem is director Scott Stewart was taking the movie too far into the cliche' of comic book action/horror movies. I see a lot of the fight and shocker scenes and pretty much know what's going to happen before it does. That's how played out the genre is. Stilted dialog that's supposed to sound cool makes me groan (been there, done that). 'Cool' poses from various characters seem to pop up in places where it's not warranted. What makes matters worse is this sort of activity seems to be painting the actors into a corner. All the opportunities for greater character development and expression are minimized in place of the perceived thrill of making another Blade/Ghost Rider/Underworld lookalike.Don't buy into the hype of this being the unrated version. All you are getting is a little more blood from scenes that weren't so bloody in the theatrical release and you get more crunching and stabbing noises than what was in the original release. Don't get me wrong. The unrated version is better, but don't expect anything near a night and day difference.The Blu-Ray release is the best to date. The visuals really stand out, and this BD does a good job with the contrast between the creepy night scenes and the bright and washed day scenes. Sound is tight too with 5.1 DTS-HD, and the mix is very well done with a better balance between sound effects and dialog than I expect from a movie like this. The special features are not bad, but nothing to really jump up and down over. Here is the breakdown:Bullets and Crucifixes - This Blu-Ray exclusive is a Picture-in-Picture feature that pops up at various points in the film.

Subjects cover film concepts, philosophies, prop making, special effects and so on.Audio Commentary - Director, writer and some actors fill you in on pretty much the same things you get from the Bullets an Crucifixes PiP feature. If you prefer commentaries over pop up windows over your movie you now have a choice without losing much from either.The Bloody Frontier - A behind the scenes featurette covering set designs, on location filming and other concepts are shown through interviews and some minor behind the scenes footage. A fair amount of this featurette is in the PiP extra, so again if you don't like doing PiP you have an option.Tools of the Trade - The second behind the scenes featurette covers weapons and vehicles. Most of it is design concepts on blending futuristic tech with an old west flavor.Deleted and Extended Scenes - Essentially unfinished footage. I recall a longer opening and closing scene along with some dialog scenes in the middle of the film. I wouldn't have minded to see some of it finished an on the movie, but there is nothing that really fleshes out the story at all.movieIQ and DB-Live - Both are Blu-Ray exclusives and both give you the opportunity to download additional content related to the movie... provided any have been made available.Trailers - Movie trailers, but not this movie. Fancy that. There is also a video game trailer for Twisted Metal along with a promo code for downloadable content for that game.Priest is pretty good as it stands, but to me is a missed opportunity to make something great from a very creative setting. If you love the hard core comic action films like ones previously mentioned then you will love this as well. If you want more than just visceral action and scenery you may still get a kick out of the concept, but maybe rent first. Priest is a noble effort that I hope gets another chance to shine above and beyond its current limitations.",3,"Creative story, but non-creative execution.

1308402,A1QRXEM0WSLGT5,B002ZG98N2,The Man With No Name,"[0, 2]","**Brief Review**I viewed this movie on Starz back a few months ago.  I watched the PG-13 rated edition of this, the theatrical version.  While not the greated film ever, this still will be an enjoyable view on tv, for some.--Story/Premise-- **(Some Spoilers Ahead...)**Paul Bettany is the lead in this film.  He is a Priest, but not the kind we are familer with.  Priests in this movie are vampire slayers, and pretty big badasses.  The back-story is pretty weak unfortunately.  The movie never really delves into why there are vampires, and gives us the viewer little info on why Priests are so good at dispatching them.FYI, the ""vampires"" in this movie are eyeless creatures with gray skin.  Monsters would be a better description of them.  They do drink blood, they are sensitive to light.  Garlic is never seen used though.  Crosses also don't seem to have any effect, although the Priests do wear them and are tattoed with a huge one on their faces.We seem to be at a lull for vampiric activity at the beginning of the film.  The church claims there are no more vampires.  The Earth seems to be relatively safe now, and the Priests are recalled out of service and forced into menial labor to get by.  This is a dark future, with dark citys similar but not at all close to the detail of 'Bladerunner'.Religion seems to be completely dominant in this reality.  The Cathelic Church seems to be the government, and not being part of the church seems not an option.  Confession is automated and forced upon the citizens.  I don't recall seeing a Pope anywhere.  Christopher Plummer makes an appearance as a high ranking Cathelic official also.Well...Paul Bettany has a close family member kidnapped by the vampires and his brother and his wife killed.  Desperate to find his kidnapped loved one and possibly avenge the death of his brother and slain wife, he defies Cathelic orders and leaves the city fully armed and blazing down the horizon on an impossibly fast chopper.But this Priest has surprises waiting for him, and a seemingly fallen comrade (Karl Urban) from the past returned...I personally thought this was good for a one time view.  If you still have a video rental store in your area, this would be worth a 1.99 rental fee, but no more.  It lacks in character development, and backstory.  It will at times lose your interest.  Also, it's ANOTHER vampire movie.  We don't need any more vampire movies!!!  Save for the 'Dark Shadows' remake and 'Underworld...4' I don't ever want to see another vampire movie again.  Well...maybe not never, but for a while.Will there be a sequel to this?, NO.  I am confidant if you want to own the Blu-Ray with it's unrated cut and additional special features, you will find it this Christmas in the bargain bin at FYE or Wal-Mart.  Amazon itself will no doubt be clearing these out at LOW prices.  So wait, I am confidant you will can get it for 7.99 or less if your patient.--In Conclusion--Weak story, weak characters.  Even Paul Bettany could not save this film.  Paul's a great actor, but it seems is not above taking a role to pay his bills.  Hey, the man's got bills to pay.  If you are one of those who are sick of vampire movies, as we all are getting, I would advise a PASS on this film.  If you like Bettany and want to see him in a GOOD film, go see the 'Avengers'.  He is the voice of Jarvis, Iron-Man's digital assistant.Well, that's my thoughts on this.  Now off to see the 'Avengers', a hopefully GREAT film...",3,"An Okay Film, But Wait For It To Come To Television.",1336089600,"05 4, 2012",2012,3473,"['**Brief', 'Review**I', 'viewed', 'movie', 'Starz', 'back', 'few', 'months', 'ago', 'watched', 'PG-13', 'rated', 'edition', 'theatrical', 'version', 'not', 'greated', 'film', 'ever', 'still', 'will', 'be', 'enjoyable', 'view', 'tv', 'some.', 'Story/Premise', '**', 'Spoilers', 'Ahead', '**Paul', 'Bettany', 'lead', 'film', 'Priest', 'not', 'kind', 'are', 'familer', 'Priests', 'movie', 'are', 'vampire', 'slayers', 'pretty', 'big', 'badasses', 'back-story', 'pretty', 'weak', 'unfortunately', 'movie', 'never', 'really', 'why', 'are', 'vampires', 'viewer', 'little', 'info', 'why', 'Priests', 'are', 'so', 'good', 'dispatching', 'them.FYI', 'vampires', 'movie', 'are', 'eyeless', 'creatures', 'gray', 'skin', 'Monsters', 'would', 'be', 'better', 'description', 'do', 'drink', 'blood', 'are', 'sensitive', 'light', 'Garlic', 'never', 'seen', 'used', 'Crosses', 'also', 'do', ""n't"", 'seem', 'have', 'effect', 'Priests', 'do', 'wear', 'are', 'tattoed', 'huge', 'one', 'faces.We', 'seem', 'be', 'lull', 'vampiric', 'activity', 'beginning', 'film', 'church', 'claims', 'are', 'more', 'vampires', 'Earth', 'be', 'relatively', 'safe', 'now', 'Priests', 'are', 'recalled', 'service', 'forced', 'menial', 'labor', 'get', 'dark', 'future', 'dark', 'citys', 'similar', 'not', 'close', 'detail', ""'Bladerunner'.Religion"", 'be', 'completely', 'dominant', 'reality', 'Cathelic', 'Church', 'be', 'government', 'not', 'being', 'part', 'church', 'not', 'option', 'Confession', 'automated', 'forced', 'citizens', 'do', ""n't"", 'recall', 'seeing', 'Pope', 'anywhere', 'Christopher', 'Plummer', 'appearance', 'high', 'ranking', 'Cathelic', 'official', 'also.Well', 'Paul', 'Bettany', 'close', 'family', 'member', 'kidnapped', 'vampires', 'brother', 'wife', 'killed', 'Desperate', 'find', 'kidnapped', 'loved', 'one', 'possibly', 'avenge', 'death', 'brother', 'slain', 'wife', 'Cathelic', 'orders', 'city', 'fully', 'armed', 'blazing', 'down', 'horizon', 'impossibly', 'fast', 'chopper.But', 'Priest', 'surprises', 'waiting', 'seemingly', 'fallen', 'comrade', 'Karl', 'Urban', 'past', 'returned', 'personally', 'thought', 'was', 'good', 'one', 'time', 'view', 'still', 'have', 'video', 'rental', 'store', 'area', 'would', 'be', '1.99', 'rental', 'fee', 'more', 'character', 'development', 'backstory', 'will', 'times', 'lose', 'interest', 'Also', 'ANOTHER', 'vampire', 'movie', 'do', ""n't"", 'need', 'more', 'vampire', 'movies', 'Save', ""'Dark"", 'Shadows', 'remake', ""'Underworld"", '4', 'do', ""n't"", 'ever', 'want', 'see', 'vampire', 'movie', 'again', 'Well', 'maybe', 'not', 'never', 'while.Will', 'there', 'be', 'sequel', 'NO', 'am', 'confidant', 'want', 'own', 'Blu-Ray', 'unrated', 'cut', 'additional', 'special', 'features', 'will', 'find', 'Christmas', 'bargain', 'bin', 'FYE', 'Wal-Mart', 'Amazon', 'will', 'doubt', 'be', 'clearing', 'out', 'LOW', 'prices', 'So', 'wait', 'am', 'confidant', 'will', 'can', 'get', '7.99', 'less', 'patient.', 'Conclusion', 'Weak', 'story', 'weak', 'characters', 'Even', 'Paul', 'Bettany', 'could', 'not', 'save', 'film', 'Paul', 'great', 'actor', 'not', 'taking', 'role', 'pay', 'bills', 'Hey', 'man', 'got', 'bills', 'pay', 'are', 'one', 'who', 'are', 'sick', 'vampire', 'movies', 'are', 'getting', 'would', 'advise', 'PASS', 'film', 'like', 'Bettany', 'want', 'see', 'GOOD', 'film', 'go', 'see', ""'Avengers"", 'voice', 'Jarvis', 'Iron-Man', 'digital', 'assistant.Well', 'thoughts', 'Now', 'see', ""'Avengers"", 'hopefully', 'GREAT', 'film']",N/A
1308403,A3BNBTDE0U1AOL,B002ZG98N2,"Thomas Marx ""Tommy Marx""","[0, 0]","This is not a great movie. The cartoon sequence used to explain the premise goes on far too long and seems superfluous; the mythology could easily have been explained during the movie's action sequences instead of being force fed to viewers like a second grade film on hygiene at the beginning. There's also the obvious gaps in logic; after successfully battling the vampires, why would anyone, let alone potential victims, choose to let the survivors live? The film never offered one reason why keeping vampires alive in reservations would benefit anyone. It also defied logic when the church, represented by a rather annoying Christopher Plummer, refused to admit that vampires were still a threat, and the subsequent blasphemy of Paul Bettany leaving the city to fight vampires never felt anything more than ridiculously manufactured.And yet I loved this movie. After watching it, I was actually upset it didn't do better at the box office, because I would love to see a sequel.There are so many unexpected scenes that reveal the humanity behind the heroes. There's the main character, who sacrificed more than anyone should to become a soldier for God, then was treated like a traitor. There was the priestess who hated herself for hoping the death of the priest's great love would finally free him to see her as more than a warrior. There was the pretty boy sheriff who couldn't save the love of his life once but desperately longed to be given a second chance (even though Cam Gigandet is a better actor in theory than in reality).And somehow it added up to something really, really good.I go into movies always hoping that they'll be worth it. I think Priest was worth it if you're the kind of person that likes stories about vampires and tragedy. It's not brilliantly written by any means - any cynical jerk would find a hundred ways to crucify it.

As the war is over and the threat of the vampires is gone (that's what the Church says), the warrior group is disbanded. But when a young girl named Lucy (Lily Collins) is kidnapped, Paul Bettany's Priest starts his own investigation, disobeying the direct order from the Church to stay out of the case.The story is not bad if not very original. The production design is a curious blend of genres. A ""Blade Runner""-like futuristic city and Western-movie towns coexist in ""Priest.""

(Actually the vampires in ""Priest"" look more like some subterranean creatures.) Directed by Scott Stewart (""Legion"" starring Paul Bettany), ""Priest"" is an assortment of various styles. It is not a bad thing. he problem is, ""Priest"" doesn't have a style of its own.Except one marginally interesting battle sequence at the end of the film, action scenes in ""Priest"" are dull and derivative. Not enough attention is given to the details of each action sequence that looks perfunctory. The story jumps from one cursory action set-piece to another without letting us know the characters or the alternate universe they live in.

The vampires in this movie are not the glittering images of humans, but a humanoid shaped monster with claws and fangs and eyeless faces.After almost losing the war against vampires, the humans come up with the ultimate weapon, specially trained men and women called Priests who have the strength and speed and training to defeat the vampires. They destroy most of the vampires and confine the rest in out of the way reserves where they are suppose to be guarded and isolated.

The action is well choreographed, the weapons look menacing and lethal, and the costumes look right for their part, either in the city or outside of it.One of the understated stars of the show are the motorcycles, looking retro and futuristic at the same time.

""Priest"" based on the popular graphic novel series created by Min-Woo Hyung crosses an epic Sergio Leone style western, the plot from John Ford's classic westernThe Searchers [Blu-ray] with elements of1984,Blade Runner (Five-Disc Complete Collector's Edition) [Blu-ray] (still influencing movies 29 years later), ""Mad Max"" or half a dozen post apocalpytic thrillers to create something uniquely cheesy and fun. Paul Bettany plays a warrior priest who fought the savage vampires that have ravaged humanity. Now that the vampires have been put into prisons in the wasteland, they are no longer a threat to humanity. When Priest's (Bettany)neice is kidnapped in a rogue vampire attack, he sets out to save her and discovers that humanity isn't safe after all.Directed by Scott Stewart (Legion [Blu-ray] another religious themed movie about the coming apocalpyse starring Paul Bettany as an angel)""Priest"" is a stylish looking film. Stewart's choice to shoot the movie somewhat like a Ford and Leone western (with epic CGI vistas that recall some of the Monument Valley footage in many of Ford's movies and extreme close ups like Leone would use in his films)works to the film's advantage. The script by Cory Goodman (the forthcoming ""Apollo 18"")leans a bit too heavily on the genre conventions borrowed from other films (including making Priest like the characters Clint Eastwood played inThe Man with No Name Trilogy (A Fistful of Dollars / For a Few Dollars More / The Good, The Bad, and the Ugly) [Blu-ray] by Leone"")at the expense of developing full blown characters but it is serviceable. Bettany proves once again to be an exceptional action hero and someone with a bigger budget and better script needs to snap him up quickly. Stewart's direction might work better if he had stronger material to work with but ""Priest"" still manages to be cheesy fun even if it feels like large chunks of the movie are missing (which I suspect they are).Likewise Maggie Q (""Nikita"" and ""Balls of Fury""), Cam Gigandet (""Pandorum"", ""Easy A"" and ""Burelsque"")and Karl Urban (""The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers"" and ""The Return of the King"", ""Star Trek"")all give more gravity to the proceedings than the script merits which makes the film appear to have more substance than it really does. Brad Dourif and Christopher Plummer are wasted in what amount to cameos (I suspect they had bigger roles that were trimmed when the film was edited)but are still welcome additions to the film.The main flaw of the film is the nagging suspicion that a lot of footage was cut. Running just 88 minutes ""Priest"" feels as if most of the character development and exposition has been sliced and diced to get us from one action scene to another and the result are characters that have no depth and rely on the attempt by the actors to embody iconic characters from past films.""Priest"" isn't a great film nor does it pretend to be--it's all about the entertainment and as a mindless bit of entertainment it's worthwhile checking out as long as you don't go in expectingHamlet [Blu-ray Book] or evenThe Matrix (10th Anniversary Edition) [Blu-ray]Could ""Priest"" be a better movie?

I experienced this movie in 3D first hand on a high-end 3D system with a 7.1 channel sound system. In my opinion, it is best to watch from a friend's house or renting it before buying.",2,Falls short of a good potenital,1314057600,"08 23, 2011",2011,1064,"[""'re"", '3D', ""'re"", 'big', 'disappointment', 'story', 'was', 'lame', '3D', 'effect', 'WOW', 'factor', 'hardly', 'reached', '3', 'ranging', '1', '10', '10', 'being', 'best', 'did', ""n't"", 'see', 'eye-popping', 'candy', 'movie', 'had', 'such', 'high', 'potential', 'failed', 'due', 'lack', 'story', 'line', 'blain', 'attitude', 'movie.In', 'opinion', 'rent', 'wait', 'late', 'night', 'TV', 'watch', 'am', 'disappointed', 'movie', 'am', 'strong', 'advocate', 'today', '3D', 'version', 'movie', '3D', 'effects', 'should', 'be', 'lot', 'better', 'is.Overall', 'rate', '2/53D', 'WOW', 'factor', '1/5Eye-popping', 'candy', '1/5Audio', '3/5Story', 'line', '2/5Acting', '2/5This', 'movie', 'so', 'much', 'potential', 'short', 'delivering', 'goods.In', 'opinion', 'one', 'should', 'think', 'renting', 'buying', 'least', 'can', 'test', 'waters', 'buying', 'pool.I', 'bought', '3D', 'blu', 'ray', 'am', 'strong', 'advocate', '3D', 'technology', 'experienced', 'movie', '3D', 'first', 'hand', 'high-end', '3D', 'system', '7.1', 'channel', 'sound', 'system', 'opinion', 'best', 'watch', 'friend', 'house', 'renting', 'buying']",N/A
