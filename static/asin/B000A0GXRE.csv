918132,AIJ3JAT8596TA,B000A0GXRE,A. Browning,"[1, 1]","I just got done watching Fever Pitch with Drew Barrymore and Jimmy Fallon. My husband and I really enjoyed it. It was an unusual romantic comedy: one you could actually enjoy with your mate! It was not too sappy or lovey. This movie is not laugh out loud funny, but there are a few funny moments. The movie had a lot of insight from a guy's point of view and it had a lot of sports!! For a Farrelly brother's movie, this one was uncharactristically normal. Usually their movies are zany, wacky, kind of over the top (Something about Mary is a good example) Although some of the Red Sox obsession was a little hard to believe, overall this was a pretty believable love story. It was neat how they followed the Red Sox and then changed the ending to the movie when they actually won the World Series!! Great date movie, friend movie, just a great movie.

And for those of you who aren't big Fallon fans, you'll be surprised... I was shocked to learn that this is a Farrelly brother's movie, the same guys who brought us crazy flicks like Dumb and Dumber and There's Something About Mary. I guess their getting tame in their old age, but that's nothing to scoff at because this is an altogether great movie. Great date movie, great romantic comedy, great comedy, great everything.Barrymore is Lindsay, a hardworking executive-type who scarcely has a minute when she isn't on the phone. Ben is a laidback geometry teacher, the teacher that all the kids like because he knows how to have fun. Ben meets Lindsay while he's taking a few of his students on a field trip to the same company that Lindsay works for. After a bit of teasing from his students that he could never get a girl who is that classy, he takes a leap and asks her out. She says no. A few days later, Lindsay's friends are bugging her because she expects to much from a relationship, and even Lindsay begins to realize that she's only been dating ""poodles."" On the first date, he goes to pick her up and, surprise, she has food poisoning. He never leaves her side. Their relationship grows, but an unexpected turn comes in mid-March. It's the beginning of the Red Sox season, and she has NO idea just how big a fan he truly is. So the question is... can she survive having a relationship with ""summer guy"" when she already knows that she loves ""fall guy""?Very, very funny and very sweet. The whole disastrous first date scene really had me laughing, especially when you can hear the nasty sound of her puking coming from the bathroom followed by her yelling at her dog to ""don't eat that!"" I suppose a bit of that familiar Farrelly brothers comedy does peak out throughout this movie. What amazed me was Fallon's performance. Seriously. Didn't know he had it in him, especially after Taxi.

My wife and I went to see it together and even though I am an American and she is British and  she has a limited baseball knowledge (although she has been to several major league games) she found plenty to enjoy and laugh about. It works very well on several levels. There are some great views of the Boston Red Sox's Fenway Park, including actual baseball game footage, great location filming of Boston itself, plenty of baseball talk, including some for the more nostalgic fans. Also, there is plenty to satisfy those wanting a romantic love story. It is a very amiable and good-natured film. It starts you out on an upbeat tempo and sustains it until the end. It leaves you feeling good. And it does it all without being overly sentimental or silly. Drew Barrymore (she reminds me more and more of Marilyn Monroe the older she gets) is lovely and sweet as Lindsey Meeks and Jimmy Fallon is also great and entirely believeable as Ben Wrightman.

If you have, then you can probably relate to this movie, ""Fever Pitch"", a film about a guy who falls for a woman and seems to have his personal life on track only to find his fanaticism with baseball getting in the way of his relationship.This movie is centered in Boston and the lead character, played by Jimmy Fallon, is hooked on the Red Sox. He has season tickets and never misses a game, not for anything. But now, he has met a woman he likes and he has to make choices. Exactly how important is baseball to him? Is it so important that he would choose it over the desires of the woman in his life? The decision isn't as easy as it sounds, for Fallon's love affair with the Red Sox is very deep and very real.There are some things I really like about this film. First of all, I like the fact that Drew Barrymore, Fallon's love interest, doesn't get all negative toward him and his interest in the Red Sox. She wants him to enjoy the things he likes best. But she does get a little impatient after a while- and understandably so- when she realizes just how crazy Fallon is for his beloved baseball team. He does end up choosing baseball over her on more than one occasion and it almost ruins the relationship. This film does a decent job in helping to answer some important questions about how much is too much when it comes to extracurricular activities.On the negative side, however, this movie is very flat. There is some humor but there is little suspense and nothing that is going to stick out in most viewers' memories as anything incredible. This story is quite simple, actually, and its lack of sophistication makes it less enjoyable than it could have been.

It wasn't until I looked on the back of the case when I noticed the ""directed by the Farrelly Brothers"" tag, notable for directing Dumb and Dumber, Me Myself and Irene and this movie about siamese twins(never saw it). It's a change of pace for sure but the film is slightly better than it's parts.Ben is a teacher who's also an insane Boston Red Sox fan. He buys season tickets and sees every guy, even sets up with his friends who's going to which game. So naturally he's single. While on a little field trip, he meets Lindsey, a button-cute businesswomen and being subtletly bullied by his class, he asks her out but she says no. Afterwards she reconsiders since he's so radically different(that's one thing that women should do more actually: quit dating the handsome as hell but inconsiderate types and pick us nerd types who are very sensitive).They end up dating, only Lindsey finds herself playing second fiddle to the Red Sox. So the rest of the film is them pretty much struggling with her trying to be supportive while he's trying to be a good boyfriend but without letting go of his passion.The charm of the film really comes from the chemistry between Jimmy Fallon and Drew Barrymore. They seem like the kind of couple where they compliment each other, if only Jimmy were a bit more interesting. I guess it's the SNL curse that Mike Myers somehow escaped that everyone who left SNL to pursue movie roles, well kinda suck. Granted there's not much for him to play with but still.If there's one thing that's slightly disappointing is the ending. Since it's a romantic comedy it does follow a formula so of course he ends up with her but since the Red Sox actually won the World Series, they changed the ending to incorporate it but it seems so much of an afterthought, it's literally ""oh yeah by the way, they won"". They should've showed them both reacting to the news they won.If you're looking for a good date movie, can't exactly go wrong with this.

When baseball is the focal point of existence winter is merely a hiatus; I so get that.  Anyways, the stars must have been in perfect alignment for the Farrelly brothers as they filmed Fallon and a very scrumptious Drew Barrymore in character at the immortal Fenway at the same time the BoSox made their improbable postseason run into magical history.  It's yet another dimension making this movie so much fun.Barrymore and Fallon play well off one another; Barrymore as a career-oriented workaholic, Fallon as a teacher by day and baseball junkie by night.  When a spark between the two ensues, it is Fallon's character who suddenly realizes there's more to life--much, much more--than baseball.  The romance has its predictable ups and downs, then its breakup, then its dramatic makeup; yet even though the viewer knows exactly what's going to happen FEVER PITCH is still grand fun due to its BoSox enhancement.  Plus the scene showing Fallon and his buds deciding who gets which of the rare allotment of season tickets had me rolling on the floor; heck, Fallon is given a plethora of great one-liners that he delivers with tongue-in-cheek chutzpah.

There has never been and in all likelihood never will again be such an heroic comeback that the Red Sox demonstrated in that unforgettable year.This movie captures the flavor, and in minutiae, the excitement generated by this never-say-die team of superb athletes. Jimmy Fallon is an excellent microcosm of the avid Bostonian fan, who for years saw their team come close to winning the World Series, but in the end came up short.

918160,A13E0ARAXI6KJW,B000A0GXRE,Ed Uyeshima,"[2, 2]","At the core of this genial, by-the-numbers 2005 rom-com is a great idea - can a die-hard Boston Red Sox fan find a loving relationship with anything but his season tickets at Fenway Park? The Farrelly Brothers, Bobby and Peter, seem like the ideal choice for the potential comic hi-jinks, but it turns out to be a much softer, more predictable film than I hoped it would be. The plot focuses on Ben, a high school geometry teacher whose lifelong obsession with the Red Sox has obscured other aspects of his life. Through a field trip with a group of his students, he meets Lindsey, a successful executive at a firm that appears to specialize in statistical information. Given that Ben is a man-child and Lindsey has exalted expectations about men that need to be cut down a few pegs, they hit it off, especially after he nurses her through a strenuous bout with food poisoning. But things start to go rather awry when spring training begins. The rest is pretty formulaic until it hits a crisis point just before the Red Sox turn it around and become play-off contenders. Real-life events intrude upon the plot as we know the Red Sox won the 2004 World Series.Although he is convincing as a baseball fanatic, Jimmy Fallon is a bit too herky-jerky a screen persona to be entirely comfortable as a romantic lead. As Lindsey, Drew Barrymore, however, appears to be maturing into a fine comic actress. At her most idiosyncratic moments, she reminds me a bit of Jean Arthur. The rest of the cast is made up of ensembles of actors representing his and her friends and his Sox-based family in his ticket section at Fenway. Even with welcome faces like Ione Skye (where has she been since """"Say Anything""?) and Marissa Jaret Winokur of Broadway's ""Hairspray"" as two of Lindsey's friends and even JoBeth Williams as her mother, the characters remain pretty much generic filler. The predictable elements should come as no surprise since Lowell Ganz and Babaloo Mandel, the team behind Billy Crystal's generic 1990's comedies, wrote the screenplay. Regardless, there is a certain charm that persists through the whole venture. The 2005 DVD has the usual assortment of extras - insightful though sometimes random commentary by the Farrellys on an alternate track, an eight-minute making-of short produced for the FOX network, two-minute featurettes on the love story angle and the Red Sox's comeback over the Yankees, thirteen deleted scenes of varying interest, a so-so gag reel and the theatrical trailer.",3,Baseball Obsession Becomes a Relationship Hurdle in a Genial Rom-Com,1170547200,"02 4, 2007",2007,2494,"['core', 'genial', 'by-the-numbers', '2005', 'rom-com', 'great', 'idea', 'can', 'die-hard', 'Boston', 'Red', 'Sox', 'fan', 'find', 'loving', 'relationship', 'anything', 'season', 'tickets', 'Fenway', 'Park', 'Farrelly', 'Brothers', 'Bobby', 'Peter', 'seem', 'ideal', 'choice', 'potential', 'comic', 'hi-jinks', 'out', 'be', 'much', 'softer', 'more', 'predictable', 'film', 'hoped', 'would', 'be', 'plot', 'Ben', 'high', 'school', 'geometry', 'teacher', 'lifelong', 'obsession', 'Red', 'Sox', 'obscured', 'other', 'aspects', 'life', 'field', 'trip', 'group', 'students', 'Lindsey', 'successful', 'executive', 'firm', 'specialize', 'statistical', 'information', 'Given', 'Ben', 'man-child', 'Lindsey', 'exalted', 'expectations', 'men', 'need', 'be', 'cut', 'down', 'few', 'pegs', 'hit', 'off', 'especially', 'strenuous', 'bout', 'food', 'poisoning', 'things', 'start', 'go', 'rather', 'awry', 'when', 'spring', 'training', 'rest', 'pretty', 'formulaic', 'crisis', 'point', 'just', 'Red', 'Sox', 'turn', 'around', 'become', 'play-off', 'contenders', 'Real-life', 'events', 'intrude', 'plot', 'know', 'Red', 'Sox', 'won', '2004', 'World', 'Series.Although', 'convincing', 'baseball', 'fanatic', 'Jimmy', 'Fallon', 'bit', 'too', 'herky-jerky', 'screen', 'persona', 'be', 'entirely', 'comfortable', 'romantic', 'lead', 'Lindsey', 'Drew', 'Barrymore', 'however', 'be', 'maturing', 'fine', 'comic', 'actress', 'most', 'idiosyncratic', 'moments', 'bit', 'Jean', 'Arthur', 'rest', 'cast', 'made', 'ensembles', 'actors', 'representing', 'friends', 'Sox-based', 'family', 'ticket', 'section', 'Fenway', 'Even', 'welcome', 'Ione', 'Skye', 'where', 'been', 'Say', 'Anything', 'Marissa', 'Jaret', 'Winokur', 'Broadway', 'Hairspray', 'two', 'Lindsey', 'friends', 'even', 'JoBeth', 'Williams', 'mother', 'characters', 'remain', 'pretty', 'much', 'generic', 'filler', 'predictable', 'elements', 'should', 'come', 'surprise', 'Lowell', 'Ganz', 'Babaloo', 'Mandel', 'team', 'Billy', 'Crystal', 'generic', '1990', 'comedies', 'wrote', 'screenplay', 'Regardless', 'certain', 'charm', 'whole', 'venture', '2005', 'DVD', 'usual', 'assortment', 'extras', 'insightful', 'sometimes', 'random', 'commentary', 'Farrellys', 'alternate', 'track', 'eight-minute', 'making-of', 'short', 'produced', 'FOX', 'network', 'two-minute', 'featurettes', 'love', 'story', 'angle', 'Red', 'Sox', 'comeback', 'Yankees', 'thirteen', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'varying', 'interest', 'so-so', 'gag', 'reel', 'theatrical', 'trailer']",N/A

I found this a bit surprising, since to a certain degree, Jimmy Fallon was pretty much playing Jimmy Fallon. However, I think Drew Barrymore really makes a great effort in this role: you could tell she has come a long way in some of her ""romantic"" roles. Because the two characters have vastly different lives, they have to make sacrifices and accommodations in their own lives, especially when they begin to fall for each other.You can probably forgive the fantasy ending.

Romantic comedies have a way of suspending belief just like action films sometimes.This movie is a winner in the end, though, because I think that it is a great baseball fan movie.

I'm pretty into sports, especially the Redskins, and my girlfriend can barely tolerate watching a half of basketball. This flick was more successful than I expected as a romance. Barrymore is her typical cutesy self and Jimmy Fallon is the goofy boyfriend that many could fall in love with. The theme of trying to accept your significant other's wackiness will always get some laughs, and it plays out well here. Some scenes, like the season ticket draft were real funny. The scenes in Fenway with the other season ticket regulars recounting Red Sox woes worked well for me too.I'm also a true sports fan, and I ended up disappointed by the ending. Certainly, the Red Sox victories threw the screenwriters for a loop. At times this works. The events surrounding the Red Sox come from behind over the Yankees juxtaposes well with Fallon's emergence as a man with some perspective. But the big lets get together and live happily ever after scene does not work with the baseball. I won't spoil it.

This Americanization of the Nick Hornby novel brings you up to speed on the final quarter-century of the Curse Of The Bambino with astonishing accuracy, such as the CGIing of the Green Monster to what it looked like back in 1980 (a deleted scene even showed the old troughs in the Fenway men's room), the old Reverse Curve sign on Storrow Drive that was defaced to read ""Reverse The Curse"" and has since been cut down by Mitt Romney, and cameos by local hardcore fans such as Jessamy Finet and Stephen King.  I managed to catch the sneak preview of it the week before it opened, and happened to get the right crowd of fellow fans who wanted to relive Game 4; there were straight-out laughs at stuff like Ben's Yankee toilet paper, Troy's comment about Ted Williams rolling over in his freezer, Ben's use of a video of Buckner like it was a drug, and a round of applause when Foulke makes that famous underhanded toss.  The guy sitting next to me said to his girlfriend that he could see himself in the footage of the crowd at the rolling rally at the end.

Drew Barrymore has trouble finding the right guy. When she finds him her friends like him but doubt he's 100% perfect. He tells her on his own that he's a huge Red Sox fan which is why he has had relationship problems. She has no problem with that though because she doesn't know how huge of a fan he actually is. Jimmy Fallon (Taxi, Saturday Night Live) shows here that he actually has some talent as the Red Fox fan/b/f. His obsession with the Red Sox is so huge that he rather go to a game than to Paris with Barrymore. Sooner or later though he realizes he has to choose love or the game he loves.Barrymore and Fallon have strong Billy Crystal and Meg Ryan type chemestry here. Such good chemestry that I wouldn't be surprised if he became Barrymore's 3rd or 4th husband lol. Plus the script is smart and realistic. I mean I'm sure real couples even have arguements like this. I'm sure most guys get mad at their wives or g/f's when they missed a good game to spend time with them instead. I'm sure the g/f gets extremely hurt by that as well.

Fontenot ""Prairie Cajun Regenerated!""","[4, 5]","I've seen almost all of the Farrelly brothers' films and I have to say that ""Fever Pitch"" falls shorter than all of them.  But don't get me wrong, ""Fever Pitch"" is sufficient as a feel good, silly romance/comedy.  It drew quite a few laughs from me while I was watching it.  I watched it alone because my wife thought it would be ""just another baseball movie.""  It isn't just another baseball movie, however, it leans more toward the romantic side of comedy.The story revolves around Jimmy Fallon's character who is probably one of the most fanatical Boston Red Sox fans you could ever find.  He's a schoolteacher who falls for number-crunching Drew Barrymore.  They quickly fall for one another and Barrymore thinks it's cute when Fallon takes a knee and asks her to go to opening day with him.  She then quickly realizes just how fanatical Fallon is and the whole thing begins to affect their lovelife, her job, and her social life.  Eventually Fallon has to decide between Barrymore and the Red Sox.As always, Barrymore pulls her character off with style.  I still don't get what's so special about Fallon.  To me, he's just a second-rate Adam Sandler.  In fact, this film would have probably been funnier had Sandler taken the reins as the Sox fan.  Their are plenty of cameos on and off of the field, from modern day sluggers to old-timers.You don't have to enjoy baseball to like this film.  For that matter, you don't have to enjoy romantic comedies to enjoy this either.  It has just the right amount of both in it to keep most viewers occupied.

But I actually enjoyed more than just the baseball footage...Drew Barrymore plays Lindsey Meeks, a dedicated and perpetuatlly-single businesswoman.  One day, she meets an average-guy schoolteacher, Ben (Jimmy Fallon).  Convinced by her friends that a normal guy with a normal life and a normal job might be just what she needs, Lindsey decides to give Ben a chance.  What follows is a whirlwind fairy-tale romance that seems too good to be true.  Then, one day, as the snow starts to thaw on the Boston Common, Ben makes a confession: he's a Red Sox fan.  If you've ever lived in Boston, you'll understand what this means.  Soon, Lindsey starts to realize that the Red Sox are more than just a baseball team.  They're her biggest competition.Fever Pitch is a must-own for any die-hard Sox fan.  But is it good enough for the non-Sox-fan viewer?  Perhaps not if you're a Yankees fan.  But Fever Pitch (loosely based on a Nick Hornby novel about what we in the States call soccer) is a cute chick flick for the rest of you.  The story may not be flawless or without its chick-flick sap, but Fallon is perfect for the role-and he and Barrymore work especially well together.  I wasn't the only one in the theater laughing to the point of tears-and, considering I now live in a place where people are usually either Reds fans or Indians fans, I think I can safely assume that you don't have to own a special edition World Series Johnny Damon T-shirt to enjoy Fever Pitch.

918192,A2NJO6YE954DBH,B000A0GXRE,Lawrance M. Bernabo,"[2, 6]","When the Boston Red Sox lost game three of the American League Championship to the New York Yankees last October and it was duly noted by everybody covering the games that no team had ever come back from that sort of deficit to win a series in the history of baseball, it suddenly hit me that doing that was exactly how the Red Sox would ""Reverse the Curse.""  I had the same sort of metaphysical certainty for what was going to happen that I did in Game 7 of the 2001 World Series when Randy Johnson came in to pitch for Arizona, which meant that if the Diamondbacks came back in the bottom of the 9th, Johnson would be the first pitcher to win three World Series games in a long, long time.  Being a Yankees fan these were both bitter realizations, and my big regret is that I did not bet $100 for the Red Sox to win the World Series in four games the night this all hit me because I would still have been miserable, but I also would have been very rich.I did not watch the final two games of the AL Championship or the World Series (I knew what was going to happen, so what was the point?), which means I decided to watch ""Fever Pitch"" with some trepidation because I can live without salt being rubbed in the wounds.  But this 2005 comedy from the Farrelly Brother can be seen and enjoyed by fans of the Evil Empire as well as the Fenway Faithful, because what is important here is that Ben (Jimmy Fallon) is a baseball fan (which, you will call is short for ""fanatic"").  Because he is a Red Sox fan he is a long-suffering baseball fan.  He could be a Cub fan, but before 2004 the Chicago northsiders were still a distant second to the Red Sox when it came to the curse of Sisyphus department since Boston had lost a trio of World Series game sevens just in my lifetime, without bringing the ""freakin'"" tag team of Bucky Dent and Aaron Boone into the picture.  Besides, Ben has turned a wall of his living room into a replica of the Green Monster, which is way cool (bricks and vines like Wrigley Field would not be as cool and unless you try and do Monument Park what are you going to try and duplicate in your home to look like Yankee Stadium?).Ben is a math teacher in a grade school.  He meets Lindsey (Drew Barrymore) on a class field trip to her office and decides to ask her out.  It takes some effort to get to not having a first date, during which it is true that he looks, but he also does cleanup duty better left to the elves.  Lindsey is suitable impressed, but what she does not understand is that this is Winter Ben.  His season tickets to the Red Sox have not yet arrived, Fenway Park is covered in snow, and he has the time to focus attention on Lindsey.  The problem is going to be when Summer Ben blooms and Lindsey gets her first indication when she sees Spring Training Ben, who is like a maniac from another planet.  No wonder this guy is twenty-ten and unmarried.  But then so is Lindsey, so she has some issues too, just not as many as this guy.  Ben has dug himself in a massive hole with Lindsey, but then so have the Red Sox and you know how their season ended.Fallon is well suited to this role overall, although there are a few moments where he needs to act less and relax more.  His character is functionally insane so the point does not need to be overplayed to work.  But the problem here is more the script, which does not really think of Ben as being a real boy and allows mean-spirited jokes in the name of humor and at the expense of the character.  Barrymore is once again on perfect pitch and solidifies her position as the current queen of romantic comedy (see also, ""50 First Dates"").  She is smart, she is cute, and when she gets that hurt look in here eyes and that her voice sounds just so sad you want to take a baseball bat to the jerk who caused her that pain.  His Greek chorus consisting of his ""summer family"" at Fenway Park comes out ahead of her gal pal group, mainly because they have the grand litany of black days in Red Sox history as the text for their riffs.Yes, the ending of the film is a blatant example of having your cake and eating it too.  But do you really want a date movie where the women come out crying because of what Ben was willing to do to keep Lindsay and the men are cursing because of what Ben was willing to do to keep Lindsay?  Be sure to check out the bonus features that talk about how Barrymore and Fallon had to scramble to get to the final game of the World Series to take advantage of how baseball reality was once again taking a backseat to Hollywood fantasy.",4,Can a die hard Boston Red Sox fan find happiness twice in one season?,1126656000,"09 14, 2005",2005,4547,"['When', 'Boston', 'Red', 'Sox', 'lost', 'game', 'three', 'American', 'League', 'Championship', 'New', 'York', 'Yankees', 'last', 'October', 'was', 'duly', 'noted', 'everybody', 'covering', 'games', 'team', 'had', 'ever', 'come', 'back', 'sort', 'deficit', 'win', 'series', 'history', 'baseball', 'suddenly', 'hit', 'doing', 'was', 'exactly', 'how', 'Red', 'Sox', 'would', 'Reverse', 'Curse', 'had', 'same', 'sort', 'metaphysical', 'certainty', 'what', 'was', 'going', 'happen', 'did', 'Game', '7', '2001', 'World', 'Series', 'when', 'Randy', 'Johnson', 'came', 'pitch', 'Arizona', 'meant', 'Diamondbacks', 'came', 'back', 'bottom', '9th', 'Johnson', 'would', 'be', 'first', 'pitcher', 'win', 'three', 'World', 'Series', 'games', 'long', 'long', 'time', 'Being', 'Yankees', 'fan', 'were', 'bitter', 'realizations', 'big', 'regret', 'did', 'not', 'bet', '100', 'Red', 'Sox', 'win', 'World', 'Series', 'four', 'games', 'night', 'hit', 'would', 'still', 'have', 'been', 'miserable', 'also', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'very', 'rich.I', 'did', 'not', 'watch', 'final', 'two', 'games', 'AL', 'Championship', 'World', 'Series', 'knew', 'what', 'was', 'going', 'happen', 'what', 'was', 'point', 'decided', 'watch', 'Fever', 'Pitch', 'trepidation', 'can', 'live', 'salt', 'being', 'rubbed', 'wounds', '2005', 'comedy', 'Farrelly', 'Brother', 'can', 'be', 'seen', 'enjoyed', 'fans', 'Evil', 'Empire', 'as', 'well', 'Fenway', 'Faithful', 'what', 'important', 'here', 'Ben', 'Jimmy', 'Fallon', 'baseball', 'fan', 'will', 'call', 'short', 'fanatic', 'Red', 'Sox', 'fan', 'long-suffering', 'baseball', 'fan', 'could', 'be', 'Cub', 'fan', '2004', 'Chicago', 'northsiders', 'were', 'still', 'distant', 'second', 'Red', 'Sox', 'when', 'came', 'curse', 'Sisyphus', 'department', 'Boston', 'had', 'lost', 'trio', 'World', 'Series', 'game', 'just', 'lifetime', 'bringing', 'freakin', 'tag', 'team', 'Bucky', 'Dent', 'Aaron', 'Boone', 'picture', 'Besides', 'Ben', 'turned', 'wall', 'living', 'room', 'replica', 'Green', 'Monster', 'way', 'cool', 'bricks', 'vines', 'Wrigley', 'Field', 'would', 'not', 'be', 'cool', 'try', 'do', 'Monument', 'Park', 'what', 'are', 'going', 'try', 'duplicate', 'home', 'look', 'Yankee', 'Stadium', '.Ben', 'math', 'teacher', 'grade', 'school', 'Lindsey', 'Drew', 'Barrymore', 'class', 'field', 'trip', 'office', 'ask', 'out', 'effort', 'get', 'not', 'having', 'first', 'date', 'true', 'also', 'cleanup', 'duty', 'better', 'left', 'elves', 'Lindsey', 'suitable', 'impressed', 'what', 'not', 'understand', 'Winter', 'Ben', 'season', 'tickets', 'Red', 'Sox', 'have', 'not', 'yet', 'arrived', 'Fenway', 'Park', 'covered', 'snow', 'time', 'focus', 'attention', 'Lindsey', 'problem', 'going', 'be', 'when', 'Summer', 'Ben', 'blooms', 'Lindsey', 'first', 'indication', 'when', 'Spring', 'Training', 'Ben', 'who', 'maniac', 'planet', 'wonder', 'guy', 'twenty-ten', 'unmarried', 'then', 'so', 'Lindsey', 'issues', 'too', 'just', 'not', 'as', 'many', 'guy', 'Ben', 'dug', 'massive', 'hole', 'Lindsey', 'then', 'so', 'have', 'Red', 'Sox', 'know', 'how', 'season', 'ended.Fallon', 'well', 'suited', 'role', 'overall', 'are', 'few', 'moments', 'where', 'act', 'less', 'relax', 'more', 'character', 'functionally', 'insane', 'point', 'not', 'need', 'be', 'overplayed', 'work', 'problem', 'here', 'more', 'script', 'not', 'really', 'think', 'Ben', 'being', 'real', 'boy', 'mean-spirited', 'jokes', 'name', 'humor', 'expense', 'character', 'Barrymore', 'once', 'again', 'perfect', 'pitch', 'position', 'current', 'queen', 'romantic', 'comedy', 'see', 'also', '50', 'First', 'Dates', 'smart', 'cute', 'when', 'hurt', 'look', 'here', 'eyes', 'voice', 'just', 'so', 'sad', 'want', 'take', 'baseball', 'bat', 'jerk', 'who', 'caused', 'pain', 'Greek', 'chorus', 'consisting', 'summer', 'family', 'Fenway', 'Park', 'out', 'ahead', 'gal', 'pal', 'group', 'mainly', 'have', 'grand', 'litany', 'black', 'days', 'Red', 'Sox', 'history', 'text', 'riffs.Yes', 'ending', 'film', 'blatant', 'example', 'having', 'cake', 'eating', 'too', 'do', 'really', 'want', 'date', 'movie', 'where', 'women', 'come', 'out', 'crying', 'what', 'Ben', 'was', 'willing', 'do', 'keep', 'Lindsay', 'men', 'are', 'cursing', 'what', 'Ben', 'was', 'willing', 'do', 'keep', 'Lindsay', 'Be', 'sure', 'check', 'out', 'bonus', 'talk', 'how', 'Barrymore', 'Fallon', 'had', 'scramble', 'get', 'final', 'game', 'World', 'Series', 'take', 'advantage', 'how', 'baseball', 'reality', 'was', 'once', 'again', 'taking', 'backseat', 'Hollywood', 'fantasy']",N/A

This time round with Hollywood stars Drew Barrymore and Jimmy Fallon, the sport is baseball.

918197,A24BUT5LD6FNQ6,B000A0GXRE,Matthew Wall,"[97, 108]","I'm a Red Sox fan and a sucker for romantic comedies, so I waited for the ""Special Red Sox Collectors Edition"" before even seeing the flick for the first time -- I knew I wanted to buy it. This review contrasts the two editions, with some minor comments about the movie at the end.Now I see I paid an extra $4 for the ""Collector's Edition"" over the regular DVD release for what amounts to about a minute of extra Red Sox highlights interpolated at the end. That's it. That's the only difference. That, my friends, is a rip-off from the marketing people, and a pretty crummy one.Not to say that as a DVD this isn't a very nice package. The gag reel is pretty funny. The directors' commentary and a couple of the featurettes are interesting enough. And the deleted scenes, frankly, make it into a better movie; I only wish they'd done a Director's cut and re-inserted the deleted scenes, because it makes the occasionally thin plot a lot fleshier. In particular, the deleted scene of Uncle Carl taking young Ben to his first game at Fenway is actually pretty wonderful, and great back story for why Ben is so addicted as an adult. It's a major weakness of Farrelly Brothers movies that they seem to cut for time what are often the best parts of the movies, resorting to the truly wretched device of voice-over narration to substitute for what would've been better done as actual story. ""Me Myself and Irene"" serves as the ultimate monument to this awful problem of trying to use voice-over narration to solve story problems, where script and editing problems could've been overcome with some attention before production was ever started. ""Fever Pitch"", fortunately, manages to stand up well enough even with the narration. It's just that it's more obvoiusly in watching the deleted scenes that this could've been raised from an enjoyable but somewhat fluffy movie to one with more of an edge -- both sweet and sour -- had they put them in the ""original"" movie.And, as I note, I did enjoy the movie -- the romantic comedy is relatively adult, and despite some glossing over of Ben and Lindsey's respective addictions to the Red Sox and the workplace, one does get a sense of adult motivations and a real relationship between the two. Jimmy Fallon, quite suprisingly, does an excellent job at walking a fine line here between not trying to be a film dreamboat (which he couldn't pull off) and avoiding being a complete moron in the loveable-moron school (which would've been unbelievable, given the Drew Barrymore character's sophistication.) In particular, he does a nice shift of gears from the sweet ""winter Ben"" to some over the top moments in the height of his Red Sox passion.One quibble, another thing that could've been fixed with the deleted scenes restored: you never quite get that verisimilitude of exactly what kind of dumb things us Red Sox fans get cranked up by -- arguing on the phone with, say, talk radio about managerial moves at 11 PM while your girlfriend lies naked and beckoning in bed, for instance. Still, good job on getting the essential passions on the table.But all that said, why on earth did I get charged an extra $4 for a few baseball highlights that do nothing to make the movie better? No good reason. If you like the movie or the idea of the movie, just buy the regular non-collectors' DVD edition. Even if you're a Red Sox diehard like me, no reason to shell out the extra money for the collectors' edition, because there's nothing to collect you won't also be able to get in the deluxe 2004 playoff DVD set of the games.",2,"Movie Gets 4 Stars, DVD Edition is a rip-off, though",1127520000,"09 24, 2005",2005,3555,"[""'m"", 'Red', 'Sox', 'fan', 'sucker', 'romantic', 'comedies', 'waited', 'Special', 'Red', 'Sox', 'Collectors', 'Edition', 'even', 'seeing', 'flick', 'first', 'time', 'knew', 'wanted', 'buy', 'review', 'two', 'editions', 'minor', 'comments', 'movie', 'end.Now', 'see', 'paid', 'extra', '4', 'Collector', 'Edition', 'regular', 'DVD', 'release', 'what', 'amounts', 'minute', 'extra', 'Red', 'Sox', 'highlights', 'interpolated', 'end', 'only', 'difference', 'friends', 'rip-off', 'marketing', 'people', 'pretty', 'crummy', 'one.Not', 'say', 'DVD', ""n't"", 'very', 'nice', 'package', 'gag', 'reel', 'pretty', 'funny', 'directors', 'commentary', 'couple', 'featurettes', 'are', 'interesting', 'enough', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'frankly', 'make', 'better', 'movie', 'only', 'wish', ""'d"", 'done', 'Director', 'cut', 're-inserted', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'occasionally', 'thin', 'plot', 'lot', 'fleshier', 'particular', 'deleted', 'scene', 'Uncle', 'Carl', 'taking', 'young', 'Ben', 'first', 'game', 'Fenway', 'actually', 'pretty', 'wonderful', 'great', 'back', 'story', 'why', 'Ben', 'so', 'addicted', 'adult', 'major', 'weakness', 'Farrelly', 'Brothers', 'movies', 'seem', 'cut', 'time', 'what', 'are', 'often', 'best', 'parts', 'movies', 'resorting', 'truly', 'wretched', 'device', 'voice-over', 'narration', 'substitute', 'what', 'would', ""'ve"", 'been', 'better', 'done', 'actual', 'story', 'Me', 'Myself', 'Irene', 'ultimate', 'monument', 'awful', 'problem', 'trying', 'use', 'voice-over', 'narration', 'solve', 'story', 'problems', 'where', 'script', 'editing', 'problems', 'could', ""'ve"", 'been', 'overcome', 'attention', 'production', 'was', 'ever', 'started', 'Fever', 'Pitch', 'fortunately', 'stand', 'up', 'well', 'enough', 'even', 'narration', 'just', 'more', 'obvoiusly', 'watching', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'could', ""'ve"", 'been', 'raised', 'enjoyable', 'somewhat', 'fluffy', 'movie', 'one', 'more', 'edge', 'sweet', 'sour', 'had', 'put', 'original', 'movie.And', 'note', 'did', 'enjoy', 'movie', 'romantic', 'comedy', 'relatively', 'adult', 'glossing', 'Ben', 'Lindsey', 'respective', 'addictions', 'Red', 'Sox', 'workplace', 'one', 'get', 'sense', 'adult', 'motivations', 'real', 'relationship', 'two', 'Jimmy', 'Fallon', 'quite', 'suprisingly', 'excellent', 'job', 'walking', 'fine', 'line', 'here', 'not', 'trying', 'be', 'film', 'dreamboat', 'could', ""n't"", 'pull', 'off', 'avoiding', 'being', 'complete', 'moron', 'loveable-moron', 'school', 'would', ""'ve"", 'been', 'unbelievable', 'given', 'Drew', 'Barrymore', 'character', 'sophistication', 'particular', 'nice', 'shift', 'gears', 'sweet', 'winter', 'Ben', 'top', 'moments', 'height', 'Red', 'Sox', 'passion.One', 'quibble', 'thing', 'could', ""'ve"", 'been', 'fixed', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'restored', 'never', 'quite', 'get', 'verisimilitude', 'exactly', 'what', 'kind', 'dumb', 'things', 'Red', 'Sox', 'fans', 'get', 'cranked', 'up', 'arguing', 'phone', 'say', 'talk', 'radio', 'managerial', 'moves', '11', 'PM', 'girlfriend', 'naked', 'beckoning', 'bed', 'instance', 'Still', 'good', 'job', 'getting', 'essential', 'passions', 'table.But', 'said', 'why', 'earth', 'did', 'get', 'charged', 'extra', '4', 'few', 'baseball', 'highlights', 'do', 'nothing', 'make', 'movie', 'better', 'good', 'reason', 'like', 'movie', 'idea', 'movie', 'just', 'buy', 'regular', 'non-collectors', 'DVD', 'edition', 'Even', ""'re"", 'Red', 'Sox', 'diehard', 'reason', 'shell', 'out', 'extra', 'money', 'collectors', 'edition', 'nothing', 'collect', 'wo', ""n't"", 'also', 'be', 'able', 'get', 'deluxe', '2004', 'playoff', 'DVD', 'set', 'games']",N/A

A man who could have found any number of women who are as fanatical about the Red Sox as he is.  But no.  It's not enough for 'Ben' to utterly ignore 'Lindsey' except for sex, (even when she is knocked unconscious by a foul ball, he ignores her until the caught ball is celebrated).  Oh ha ha ha she has to have a CT scan of her head.  Big deal.Even though 'Ben' could have hooked up with any of the women who knew him well because he held lifetime seats at Fenway, they weren't good enough for him.  My take on this is that he didn't like women at all, and that it was only by seeking women who would reject him, until, that is, he found the ""right"" one whose life he could destroy, so that he could find balance.  I don't see this as much different from psychotic behavior -- (someone who knows films well, and writes about them, could give many examples).That this kind of movie would be made in the 21st century is nauseating.  That Drew Barrymore agreed to be in it - - even moreso. That so many people claim to have enjoyed this movie is very, very disturbing.  Good thing 'Ben' was able to make a 'whole' woman out of 'Lindsey'.

The movie has some nice comic bits and a sense of reality grounded in the stars' alluring comraderie.

I had to close my eyes at the end for a few seconds when they showed the Red Sox comeback in the AL Championship series.Because the Red Sox our biggest American League rival people think it was always that way.  But it wasn't.  When I grew up in the 1950s the Red Sox had great hitters like Ted Williams and Pete Runnels.  But they were never a contender.  The Yankees rivals were the Indians and White Sox, the only two teams to beat them out for the American League pennant.  But those rivalries were nothing compared to the Brooklyn Dodger vs New York Yankee rivarly that develop when they meet in the World Series 4 times in the decade.In this movie Jimmy Fallon meets Drew Barrymore and falls in love with her.  But this happens in the winter and the true Red Sox fanaticism doesn't really come until baseball season.  She gets a hint when she see how his apartment looks like Fenway Park.  But the true understanding doesn't hit until she see him with friends on ESPN while they were down in Florida watching for the new prospects.The theme of the story is all about her finding time for a man in her life and we see how this very succesful woman is embarrassed when she is caught sleeping on the job.  For Fallon it is about finding time for her with his busy schedule attendiing Red Sox games.  He inherited two season tickets and before the season starts he and his friends get to decide who gets to go with him for these games.  With Drew in his life he picks her to go with him to the most important games.  One day he had to miss a game for a dinner appointment with her parents.The last straw seems to be when he hesitates about taking a trip with her to Paris because the Sox would be in town.  In the end he is depressed and decides to sell his tickets and show her that he would give up the Red Sox for her.  If you go see it watch how it plays out.  It is very funny and romantic.For me the most interesting part was that it was filmed during the 2004 season and so as they filmed the outcome was in doubt because it hinged on how the Red Sox would do.  The soap opera story of the Red Sox being humiliated in game 3 of the AL Championship Series, then being down with no wins and three losses even their die hard fans were throwing in the towel.  After all no team in the history of the playoffs and World series had ever comeback down 3-0 to win a 7 game series.  But in Hollywood fashion they did.  That gave them the impetus to reverse thecurse and sweeo the Cardinals in the World Series. Fallon and Barrymore actually attended some of the games and were filmed there.This film is good for men and women.  Men love it for the baseball and an undersanding of how serious fans can be about their team.  Women love it for the romance, a real chick flick.",5,Yankee fan likes a Red Sox movie?,1216425600,"07 19, 2008",2008,2877,"['am', 'true', 'Yankee', 'fan', 'Red', 'Sox', 'are', 'now', 'biggest', 'rivals', 'still', 'enjoyed', 'movie', 'had', 'close', 'eyes', 'end', 'few', 'seconds', 'when', 'showed', 'Red', 'Sox', 'comeback', 'AL', 'Championship', 'series.Because', 'Red', 'Sox', 'biggest', 'American', 'League', 'rival', 'people', 'think', 'was', 'always', 'way', 'was', ""n't"", 'When', 'grew', 'up', '1950s', 'Red', 'Sox', 'had', 'great', 'hitters', 'Ted', 'Williams', 'Pete', 'Runnels', 'were', 'never', 'contender', 'Yankees', 'rivals', 'were', 'Indians', 'White', 'Sox', 'only', 'two', 'teams', 'beat', 'out', 'American', 'League', 'pennant', 'rivalries', 'were', 'nothing', 'compared', 'Brooklyn', 'Dodger', 'vs', 'New', 'York', 'Yankee', 'rivarly', 'develop', 'when', 'meet', 'World', 'Series', '4', 'times', 'decade.In', 'movie', 'Jimmy', 'Fallon', 'Drew', 'Barrymore', 'love', 'winter', 'true', 'Red', 'Sox', 'fanaticism', ""n't"", 'really', 'come', 'baseball', 'season', 'hint', 'when', 'see', 'how', 'apartment', 'Fenway', 'Park', 'true', 'understanding', ""n't"", 'hit', 'see', 'friends', 'ESPN', 'were', 'down', 'Florida', 'watching', 'new', 'prospects.The', 'theme', 'story', 'finding', 'time', 'man', 'life', 'see', 'how', 'very', 'succesful', 'woman', 'embarrassed', 'when', 'caught', 'sleeping', 'job', 'Fallon', 'finding', 'time', 'busy', 'schedule', 'attendiing', 'Red', 'Sox', 'games', 'inherited', 'two', 'season', 'tickets', 'season', 'friends', 'get', 'decide', 'who', 'go', 'games', 'Drew', 'life', 'go', 'most', 'important', 'games', 'One', 'day', 'had', 'miss', 'game', 'dinner', 'appointment', 'parents.The', 'last', 'straw', 'be', 'when', 'taking', 'trip', 'Paris', 'Sox', 'would', 'be', 'town', 'end', 'depressed', 'sell', 'tickets', 'show', 'would', 'give', 'up', 'Red', 'Sox', 'go', 'see', 'watch', 'how', 'out', 'very', 'funny', 'romantic.For', 'most', 'interesting', 'part', 'was', 'was', 'filmed', '2004', 'season', 'so', 'filmed', 'outcome', 'was', 'doubt', 'hinged', 'how', 'Red', 'Sox', 'would', 'do', 'soap', 'opera', 'story', 'Red', 'Sox', 'being', 'humiliated', 'game', '3', 'AL', 'Championship', 'Series', 'then', 'being', 'down', 'wins', 'three', 'losses', 'even', 'die', 'hard', 'fans', 'were', 'throwing', 'towel', 'team', 'history', 'playoffs', 'World', 'series', 'had', 'ever', 'comeback', 'down', '3-0', 'win', '7', 'game', 'series', 'Hollywood', 'fashion', 'did', 'gave', 'impetus', 'reverse', 'thecurse', 'sweeo', 'Cardinals', 'World', 'Series', 'Fallon', 'Barrymore', 'actually', 'attended', 'games', 'were', 'filmed', 'there.This', 'film', 'good', 'men', 'women', 'Men', 'love', 'baseball', 'undersanding', 'how', 'serious', 'fans', 'can', 'be', 'team', 'Women', 'love', 'romance', 'real', 'chick', 'flick']",N/A

It's rightful focus was Fallon and Barrymore's romance.  I'm an Angel and Padre fan.  I'm a fan of them both because I've lived in San Diego for for years, and I've lived very close by to the Angels most of my life (was even at one of the 2002 world series games).  I was impressed with how the Farrelly bros were able to film during the Red Sox games.  These scenes were pretty good.  I especially liked how they had Drew run onto the field during a game.The Farrelly brothers created a good sports, romance, and comedy movie.  If this was supposed to be loosely based off of Nick Hornby's book I don't know.  I haven't read Nick's books, but they are on my to read list.Jimmy Fallon was actually likeable - and I find him annoying on his late night show.  If you think his obsession for the Red Sox team was exaggerated - you're wrong.  Some sports fans are very much like him.  My mother almost comes close.  She thinks the Angel's manager can hear her when she yells at the tv.  Fallon was actually perfect for this role. Fallon and the character Ben Wrightman are both goofy and child-like.  Ben is a math teacher who gets along great with kids and in my opinion it's because he is one.Drew Barrymore's performance I loved.  She plays Lindsey Meeks, who is a top notch business woman.  Her character is very strong and likeable.  Lindsey's lifestyle is different from Ben's.  For one, she's not a Red Sox fan.  Another difference is that she's more mature than he is.

918204,A3UPYGJKZ0XTU4,B000A0GXRE,mirasreviews,"[3, 3]","""Fever Pitch"" is based on Nick Hornby's autobiographical novel of the same name, which chronicled the life of a fanatical British soccer fan. A more faithful film adaptation of the novel was made in 1997 in the UK. This latest version moves the action to Boston, USA, and changes the sport to baseball. Ben Wrightman (Jimmy Fallon) has been an obsessive Boston Red Sox fan since his Uncle Carl took him to a game at Fenway Park when he was 7 years old. Twenty-three years later, his enthusiasm for the Red Sox is undiminished. When he takes some of his geometry students to visit a professional who has applied mathematics to her career, Ben meets Lindsay Meeks (Drew Barrymore). Lindsay is an ambitious, successful corporate number-cruncher, in contrast to Ben's laid back, boyish school teacher, but the two awkwardly hit it off. Ben seems like the perfect man for Lindsay, but her friends wonder why such a nice guy is still single at age 30. With baseball season on the horizon, Lindsay is about to find out.Directors Peter and Bobby Farrelly are huge Red Sox fans themselves, so were a perfect fit for ""Fever Pitch"". Drew Barrymore and Jimmy Fallon both give appealing performances, making their characters' obsessions quirky, innocuous, and funny. Ben Wrightman captures Fallon's cute, disheveled, comedic charm. Barrymore has never looked better. So the biggest battle in a romantic comedy -appealing stars- is no battle here. Lindsay's trio of girlfriends deserves some mention. Ione Skye, Marissa Jaret Winokur, and KaDee Strickland are insightful and amusing as Lindsay's friends who are the first to wonder why Ben is still single. The women's conversations make good-natured fun of their competitiveness and suspicions, but strike me as very true to life. They probably add more to the film than their counterparts in Ben's trio of friends. I think ""Fever Pitch"" is a little too long for a romantic comedy. Some nonessential material could have been cut. But this is a fun film that revolves around the question of how much people should change for a relationship and how much they should expect the other person to change.  And it's likely to ring funny and true with sports fans and their mates.The DVD (20th Century Fox 2005): Bonus features include 13 deleted scenes, a gag reel (6 min.), a theatrical trailer (2  min.), 3 featurettes, and an audio commentary. In the ""Love Triangle Internet Feature"" (2 min.), Drew Barrymore talks about her character. ""Break the Curse Internet Feature"" (2  min.) is about the Red Sox winning streak in 2004, which coincided with the filming of the movie and how they were able to film at the World Series when the Red Sox won. ""Making a Scene Fever Pitch"" (8 minutes) features interviews with the Farrelly Brothers and their producers about the necessity of getting to St. Louis and filming at the World Series because it would cost so much to reproduce the scene if the Red Sox won. They tell the story of moving shooting from Toronto to St. Louis on the spur of the moment and borrowing one of Fox Sports' cameras to film in the stands.

918224,A16QODENBJVUI1,B000A0GXRE,Robert Moore,"[1, 2]","Are the Farrelly Brothers growing up?  In the past they have made a string of utterly insane comedies that sometimes barely bordered on the edge of good taste (well, sometimes they did indeed cross over the edge), but here they have a movie that is tasteful from beginning to end.  That is not to say that it is bad for all that.  I found the first ten or fifteen minutes to be a bit on the slow side, and the vomit scenes unpleasant (I'm sorry, any guy who hung around an apartment while someone was being sick would not be taken a adorable and the act not as romantic, but all in all more than a little weird, especially the staying on the couch overnight part), but after it got underway, I enjoyed this quite a bit.This is actually a pretty accurate picture of what relationships are like:  flawed and filled with compromise.  The movies all-too-often portray romance as if it were all a question of waiting for the perfect person, while in fact it is a question of waiting for an imperfect person.  The issue in FEVER PITCH is whether one can have a relationship with someone who is overall pretty decent, but has an overwhelming obsession in their life.  In this case, can Lindsey manage a relationship with Ben, who is a really nice guy except for his utter obsession with the Boston Red Sox, an obsession that might top his love for her?  I really liked this whole idea of imperfect people forcing themselves to make compromises to find--as the self-help book tells us--someone to love instead of someone perfect.The movie was pretty funny throughout, not one of the funniest you'll see, but enough to be consistently entertaining.  I have always liked Drew Barrymore and loved seeing her in this as in her previous films (though I didn't like the red hair).  I have always hated Jimmy Fallon (sorry, but its true) and while I'm not anxious to search out his next movie, I didn't dislike him in this like I expected to.  I do think the movie would have been strengthened by a stronger actor in his role, but he didn't kill the film by any stretch of the imagination.  I really enjoyed all the location shots in the film, not just in Fenway (my second favorite MLB ballpark after my beloved Wrigley Field, only two blocks from my apartment) but in Boston as a whole.All in all, this was a pretty decent romantic comedy.

He is generally not a complete idiot, he does not generally own 9,000 pieces of memorabilia or cover his ears at a restaurant so he won't know who won last night's baseball game. That's the annoying sports fanatic.""Fever Pitch"" gives us the second fan, Ben (Jimmy Fallon), junior high math teacher goofball follower of the Boston Red Sox. He's thirty going on fourteen, thoughtful enough, a little off in his priorities, and generally not a funny guy. Girls may very well find him funny, and the portrayal of his fanaticism accurate. But, then, they're girls. This is probably what they think most guys are like with sports. The female equivalent to Ben would be a shopaholic riding around *inside* the cart at Shopko.Directed by Peter and Bobby Farrelly, the movie is really more about Lindsey (producer Drew Barrymore) a thirtysomething engineer who meets Ben when he brings some students to her firm. On a dare Ben asks Lindsey out and plays nice through their winter courtship, helping Lindsey keep her jackal pack of gossipy, doubting friends at bay.Then baseball season begins, and Ben turns down a trip to Lindsey's parents to go scout his team at spring training. Later he rejects a weekend in Paris to see a Sox game. The inevitable conflicts ensue. Ben has the team. Lindsey has her job. Cue up the typical peaks, valleys and misunderstandings of a romantic comedy. Fallon and Barrymore has fair chemistry, although Barrymore is cuter than Fallon is anything. Ben is a bore, a sheepish, unimpressive geek with an immature wardrobe and childlike view of life. Lindsey's pretty forgiving, really, and the movie fudges a bit by having Ben break her heart in a key scene instead of simply allowing Lindsey to level him with a hard gaze and tell him to grow up.It'd be more forgivable if ""Fever Pitch"" seemed to know much about the Red Sox, or baseball. The script by Lowell Ganz and Babaloo Mandel doesn't go there. Yes, Ben recounts the Sox' unfortunate history after trading Babe Ruth in 1919. But he doesn't express any love for the sport - other than saying it's simple, which is not the same as saying it's sublime - never declares a favorite player, never jeers an opposing team. And Fallon, as the hired hand - it's Barrymore's production remember - does what he's told. It's a guy's flick cut off at the stirrups.",2,"A chick flick about a sports fanatic?

We hadn't seen it since it was in the theaters, so it was fresh and funny all over again.Both leads do a great job, particularly Jimmy Fallon.  Not that Drew Barrymore isn't great, but we've come to expect that from her, so the performance by Jimmy Fallon was a refreshing surprise.  Yes, he's doing his lovable, funny, stuttering schtick, but it works, and he has moments of real emotion, as well.The romance angle is a little broad, with her as the hard-driving, upwardly mobile professional woman (complete with her pack of predictably diverse girlfriends/drinking-workout partners) and him as the cool school teacher who lives for his one passion, the Red Sox (complete with his pack of predictably diverse friends/season-ticket leeches).When they meet, he's in 'Winter Guy' mode, and they spend a few months developing a romantic relationship.  However, once Spring Training starts up he switches to 'Summer Guy' mode, and his obsession with the Sox begins to manifest itself into their relationship.Hilarity ensues, as they say, along with some rom-com level drama.  The interesting twist for this film is that it is set and was filmed during the Red Sox successful run for the World Series title in 2004.  They adapt the vanquishing of 'The Curse' into the plot of the film, and it adds a touch of realism not normally found in most rom-coms.A very enjoyable film, even more so on repeat viewing, where it held up remarkably well.

The only part of this movie that I enjoyed was the ending, being reminded that the Red Sox actually won the World Series last year. I am from Boston, and of course a Red Sox fan, therefore if I were not from Boston I would have found nothing in this movie enjoyable whatsoever.This movie is plagued by many things. First of all it is not funny. There is not one laugh out loud, or even one quiet laugh to oneself scene, in the entire 100 minutes.  Yes it was so bad I was counting.  The movie is completely unrealistic from the dialogue to basically everything else.  How can a school teacher afford box-seat season tickets to Fenway Park, a gorgeous huge apartment in the North End, and an exorbitant amount of highly expensive professional sports gear.Also note to Directors it has long been practiced by EVERY NETWORK in EVERY SPORT to not show fans on TV when they have charged the field.  This has been the case now for 10 years much to my, and probably everyone else's dismay.I really can't trash this movie enough.  Did i mention that the dialogue stinks? Well it does.THis movie is one of the most annoying movies that I have ever watched. I can't believe the same poeple that made Something about Mary had anything to do with this movie.But we all know that the Farrelly Brothers have long since...well made anything remotely close to a good, decent, or even slightly funny movie.....""Stuck together"" and now this.Hang it up guys. There's obviously nothing left in your collective brotherly tank.  And speaking of tank...this movie tanks big time.But Fenway Park is as beautiful as ever, and being reminded of the Red Sox incredible comeback against the Yanks was almost worth the suck......well not quite. It puts a bad taste in my mouth that the Red Sox had anything to do with this terrible movie. But then again I can feel lucky that at least I am not a Knick Fan and have to put up with Whoopie Goldberg's atrocious ""EDDIE"". Was there ever a worse movie then that?Well this is close.If you liked ""Eddie"" staring Whoopie Goldberg then you might like this. If you thought Eddie stunk then you probably want to stay away from this stinkaroo as well. If you are a Red Sox fan then just put in the 2004 season DVD for the 320th time.

Under ordinary circumstances, ""Fever Pitch"" would not have worked for me, but due to circumstances beyond the Farrelly's control, it did and does. ""Fever Pitch"" is a sometimes cute, sometimes sweet, sometimes touching but uneven romantic comedy about obsessions, compromise and compassion. It is also an ode to the Red Sox and their fans. It has some very good moments, like when young Ben first sees Fenway Park or the Opening Day sequence when Lindsey (the luminous Drew Barrymore) starts to see what all the fuss is about.  But, it can't seem to control the urge to be crude or over-the-top. So, it tends to veer wildly from sweet to juvenile and cartoonish. Also, the movie could have been an enjoyable family movie if not for unnecessary sexual references and non-explicit sexual situations. But, it gets to me, and I'm not a member of Red Sox nation, although I love baseball.

918239,ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T,B000A0GXRE,Tsuyoshi,"[2, 2]","`Fever Pitch' is loosely based on the book written by Nick Hornby, which was originally made a film in 1997 starring Colin Firth. Like his book `High Fidelity,' the filmmakers decided to move the location to America this time, and Premier League and Arsenal became Major League and Boston Red Sox, and now the newer film stars Drew Barrymore and Jimmy Fallon.But the changes do not affect the film itself very much for the two leads did a fantastic job as office worker Lindsey and school teacher Ben. Lindsey and Ben fall in love with each other, but it is not easy for Lindsey to successfully balance her work and her life with Ben, a die-hard Red Sox fan who has season tickets to Fenway Park. And this year it seems Boston Red Sox is going to break the curse.There are lots of funny moments (without gross-out gags you have seen in Farrelly Brothers who directed this film), and Drew Barrymore is always great in romantic comedy. Jimmy Fallon is also very good as Ben, and what is remarkable about his character is that he didn't rely on caricature, creating the three-dimensional character of Ben.To me, one disappointing thing about `Fever Pitch' is its concluding chapters, which are not only predictable (OK, I can live with that), but also are told too hurriedly. The film's dramatic ending about the story of Lindsey and Ben needs more time and subtle treatment. (It is changed because of the Red Sox's winning at the World Series.) And though I know very well that this is no longer Nick Hornby, the film could have provided some more wit or insightful observation about the sports fans.As romantic comedy the film is a success thanks to the two leads. I enjoyed watching lovely Drew Barrymore in `Fever Pitch,' thinking at the same time: What kind of guy doesn't prefer spending time with Lindsey? But some people actually don't; as the film shows, they prefer watching their team beat the rival even though they sense that as one kid quietly says to Ben, the team may not ""love back."" But you know for sure no matter what happens, Drew's Lindsey would love back. This is one of the established rules of sweet, cute and (sorry but) conventional romantic comedy, which `Fever Pitch' is.",3,"A Double, If Not a Home Run, Thanks to the Two Leads",1164844800,"11 30, 2006",2006,2197,"['Fever', 'Pitch', 'loosely', 'based', 'book', 'written', 'Nick', 'Hornby', 'was', 'originally', 'made', 'film', '1997', 'starring', 'Colin', 'Firth', 'book', 'High', 'Fidelity', 'filmmakers', 'decided', 'move', 'location', 'America', 'time', 'Premier', 'League', 'Arsenal', 'became', 'Major', 'League', 'Boston', 'Red', 'Sox', 'now', 'newer', 'film', 'stars', 'Drew', 'Barrymore', 'Jimmy', 'Fallon.But', 'changes', 'do', 'not', 'affect', 'film', 'very', 'much', 'two', 'leads', 'did', 'fantastic', 'job', 'office', 'worker', 'Lindsey', 'school', 'teacher', 'Ben', 'Lindsey', 'Ben', 'fall', 'love', 'other', 'not', 'easy', 'Lindsey', 'successfully', 'balance', 'work', 'life', 'Ben', 'die-hard', 'Red', 'Sox', 'fan', 'who', 'season', 'tickets', 'Fenway', 'Park', 'year', 'Boston', 'Red', 'Sox', 'going', 'break', 'curse.There', 'are', 'lots', 'funny', 'moments', 'gross-out', 'gags', 'have', 'seen', 'Farrelly', 'Brothers', 'who', 'directed', 'film', 'Drew', 'Barrymore', 'always', 'great', 'romantic', 'comedy', 'Jimmy', 'Fallon', 'also', 'very', 'good', 'Ben', 'what', 'remarkable', 'character', 'did', ""n't"", 'rely', 'caricature', 'creating', 'three-dimensional', 'character', 'Ben.To', 'one', 'disappointing', 'thing', 'Fever', 'Pitch', 'concluding', 'chapters', 'are', 'not', 'only', 'predictable', 'OK', 'can', 'live', 'also', 'are', 'told', 'too', 'hurriedly', 'film', 'dramatic', 'ending', 'story', 'Lindsey', 'Ben', 'more', 'time', 'subtle', 'treatment', 'changed', 'Red', 'Sox', 'winning', 'World', 'Series', 'know', 'very', 'well', 'no', 'longer', 'Nick', 'Hornby', 'film', 'could', 'have', 'provided', 'more', 'wit', 'insightful', 'observation', 'sports', 'fans.As', 'romantic', 'comedy', 'film', 'success', 'thanks', 'two', 'leads', 'enjoyed', 'watching', 'lovely', 'Drew', 'Barrymore', 'Fever', 'Pitch', 'thinking', 'same', 'time', 'What', 'kind', 'guy', ""n't"", 'prefer', 'spending', 'time', 'Lindsey', 'people', 'actually', 'do', ""n't"", 'film', 'shows', 'prefer', 'watching', 'team', 'beat', 'rival', 'even', 'sense', 'one', 'kid', 'quietly', 'Ben', 'team', 'may', 'not', 'love', 'back', 'know', 'sure', 'matter', 'what', 'Drew', 'Lindsey', 'would', 'love', 'back', 'one', 'established', 'rules', 'sweet', 'cute', 'sorry', 'conventional', 'romantic', 'comedy', 'Fever', 'Pitch']",N/A

It's cheesy as all get-up, as sappy as maple syrup, and the final scene is so unbelievable as to be laughable.  Yet, at least for me, ""Fever Pitch"" works because of one factor: the ability to describe the life of a baseball die-hard.For a basic plot summary, this movie tells the love story of Ben (Jimmy Fallon) and Lindsey (Drew Barrymore).  Ben, a school teacher with a Boston Red Sox obsession and Lindsey, a confident career-woman, play off each other's personas in typical rom-com format.Had this movie not dealt with baseball, I probably wouldn't have had anything to do with it.  At its core, it is true rom-com through and through.  However, being a huge baseball fan, I could really relate to Fallon's character.  The entire film really nails baseball fanaticism.  Whether it is Ben getting down on one knee to reveal...a ticket to Opening Day, or charting out pitching schedules to make sure he never misses Pedro Martinez, Fallon's antics are very relatable to the hardball diehards.  Over the top, yes, but springing from a kernel of real sports fanaticism.Another ""luck"" factor to this movie is that it follows the 2004 Boston Red Sox, perhaps the most endearing baseball team so far this millennium.  Every baseball fan (from the Bronx to the Bay) remembers that fantastic run, so this movie (by sheer luck) re-captures that magic every time it is played.Overall, ""Fever Pitch"" is a traditional romantic comedy that just happens to be something more for fans of the'04 Red Sox or baseball fanatics in general.
