The plot, what there was of it could have been very funny but there were so many missed oppurtunities.  The lighting was unflattering and the script lacked any consistency.

902632,A2SZ86FLBMZPLL,B00097E72G,"B. Etnyre ""roguemissive""","[1, 3]","In customer reviews there is excessive use of hyperbole and exaggeration when reviewing films. Way, way too many times the phrase ""Worst Film Ever"" or ""worst film I have ever seen"" is casually and capriciously used, even though the latter claim is most likely inaccurate and the first one almost certainly is inaccurate.However, this film may well merit some of the more scathing aspersions.  I have seen hundreds of movies - perhaps more than a thousand - in my lifetime.  It's hard to remember ALL the details of EVERY film I have seen, although the more notable ones still stand out in memory.  I don't know if this is the all-time worst movie I have ever seen, but there is a good chance that it might be.  I don't know if this is the worst film ever made (others will disagree), though I think there is a solid argument that can be made for its candidacy.Although this is the point in my reviews where I usually give a brief summary of the plot, there really isn't much of a plot or storyline to describe.  I am well aware that this was supposed to be a self-parodying genre (making fun of bad girls in prison retro-exploitation) satire, which was one of the main reasons I rented it (the other reason was seeing nude women).  I also knew this was a schlocky b-movie that was supposed to be bad on purpose (one of those ""so bad it's funny"" kinds of films).  I seen rented plenty of Seduction Cinema films for these two reasons (mostly the nude women).  I was also looking forward to seeing Rhonda Shear again, a humorous beauty from my younger days of watching the USA Network's ""Up All Night"" program.  Taking all this into mind, and reducing expectations accordingly, I watched the movie... or tried to anyways.  This movie is so utterly awful, that even fast forwarding wasn't enough.  It was just atrocious.  Not in the ""so bad it's funny"" way, but in a ""so bad now I'm really irritated that I wasted my time and money and dignity on such a terrible movie"" way.  The producers and director may have thought themselves campy and clever, but they are delusional and disingenuous.  It was the most miserable excuse of a film that I can remember, largely due to the obvious lack of effort.I knew the acting and writing and directing would be bad - but I didn't think it would be this irritatingly bad.  Subjective perspectives aside, the film was sloppy and lazy and UNFUNNY and seemed to have so little effort put into it, that the people who made it and released it really ought to be embarrassed and indeed ashamed of themselves.  Having helped to produce several no budget indie films with part-time cast and crew, I have learned to appreciate the efforts of films that may not be as good, and to try and be less harsh in my observations.  I can respect a poorly made film that I don't like, if there was a lot of effort and not much in the way of budget.  This movie had no redeeming qualities at all - even the one ultimate redeeming aspect (nude women) was so poorly underdone that it wasn't worth watching (they also decided that a number of male actors should be included in the ubiquitous shower scenes).  In other words, the single-helix imbeciles who carelessly threw together this slapdash pile of crap managed to take a solid (if trashy) genre icon with a dedicated fan base and low expectations, and make it utterly unwatchable.Although I have written a few unflattering reviews, I have for the most part avoided excessive hyperbole in my comments.  This sorry excuse for a film is so annoying that it did provoke some degree of ire.  Although I do realize that it's just a movie (barely), and that there is not a need to get wrapped up in something as trivial as this, it does earn the recognition of its sloppiness and laziness.  There are no acceptable excuses for how bad this film is.",1,Don't waste your time or your money,1185753600,"07 30, 2007",2007,3809,"['customer', 'reviews', 'excessive', 'use', 'hyperbole', 'exaggeration', 'when', 'reviewing', 'films', 'Way', 'way', 'too', 'many', 'times', 'phrase', 'Worst', 'Film', 'Ever', 'worst', 'film', 'have', 'ever', 'seen', 'casually', 'capriciously', 'used', 'even', 'latter', 'claim', 'most', 'likely', 'inaccurate', 'first', 'one', 'almost', 'certainly', 'inaccurate.However', 'film', 'may', 'well', 'merit', 'more', 'scathing', 'aspersions', 'have', 'seen', 'hundreds', 'movies', 'perhaps', 'more', 'thousand', 'lifetime', 'hard', 'remember', 'details', 'EVERY', 'film', 'have', 'seen', 'more', 'notable', 'ones', 'still', 'stand', 'out', 'memory', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'all-time', 'worst', 'movie', 'have', 'ever', 'seen', 'good', 'chance', 'might', 'be', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'worst', 'film', 'ever', 'made', 'others', 'will', 'disagree', 'think', 'solid', 'argument', 'can', 'be', 'made', 'candidacy.Although', 'point', 'reviews', 'where', 'usually', 'give', 'brief', 'summary', 'plot', 'really', ""n't"", 'much', 'plot', 'storyline', 'describe', 'am', 'well', 'aware', 'was', 'supposed', 'be', 'self-parodying', 'genre', 'making', 'fun', 'bad', 'girls', 'prison', 'retro-exploitation', 'satire', 'was', 'one', 'main', 'reasons', 'rented', 'other', 'reason', 'was', 'seeing', 'nude', 'women', 'also', 'knew', 'was', 'schlocky', 'b-movie', 'was', 'supposed', 'be', 'bad', 'purpose', 'one', 'so', 'bad', 'funny', 'kinds', 'films', 'seen', 'rented', 'plenty', 'Seduction', 'Cinema', 'films', 'two', 'reasons', 'mostly', 'nude', 'women', 'was', 'also', 'looking', 'forward', 'seeing', 'Rhonda', 'Shear', 'again', 'humorous', 'beauty', 'younger', 'days', 'watching', 'USA', 'Network', 'Night', 'program', 'Taking', 'mind', 'reducing', 'expectations', 'accordingly', 'watched', 'movie', 'tried', 'anyways', 'movie', 'so', 'utterly', 'awful', 'even', 'fast', 'forwarding', 'was', ""n't"", 'enough', 'was', 'just', 'atrocious', 'Not', 'so', 'bad', 'funny', 'way', 'so', 'bad', 'now', ""'m"", 'really', 'irritated', 'wasted', 'time', 'money', 'dignity', 'terrible', 'movie', 'way', 'producers', 'director', 'may', 'have', 'thought', 'campy', 'clever', 'are', 'delusional', 'disingenuous', 'was', 'most', 'miserable', 'excuse', 'film', 'can', 'remember', 'largely', 'due', 'obvious', 'lack', 'effort.I', 'knew', 'acting', 'writing', 'directing', 'would', 'be', 'bad', 'did', ""n't"", 'think', 'would', 'be', 'irritatingly', 'bad', 'Subjective', 'perspectives', 'aside', 'film', 'was', 'sloppy', 'lazy', 'UNFUNNY', 'seemed', 'have', 'so', 'little', 'effort', 'put', 'people', 'who', 'made', 'released', 'really', 'ought', 'be', 'embarrassed', 'indeed', 'ashamed', 'Having', 'helped', 'produce', 'several', 'budget', 'indie', 'films', 'part-time', 'cast', 'crew', 'have', 'learned', 'appreciate', 'efforts', 'films', 'may', 'not', 'be', 'as', 'good', 'try', 'be', 'less', 'harsh', 'observations', 'can', 'respect', 'poorly', 'made', 'film', 'do', ""n't"", 'like', 'was', 'lot', 'effort', 'not', 'much', 'way', 'budget', 'movie', 'had', 'redeeming', 'qualities', 'even', 'one', 'ultimate', 'redeeming', 'aspect', 'nude', 'women', 'was', 'so', 'poorly', 'underdone', 'was', ""n't"", 'worth', 'watching', 'also', 'decided', 'number', 'male', 'actors', 'should', 'be', 'included', 'ubiquitous', 'shower', 'scenes', 'other', 'words', 'single-helix', 'imbeciles', 'who', 'carelessly', 'threw', 'together', 'slapdash', 'pile', 'crap', 'managed', 'take', 'solid', 'trashy', 'genre', 'icon', 'dedicated', 'fan', 'base', 'low', 'expectations', 'make', 'utterly', 'have', 'written', 'few', 'unflattering', 'reviews', 'have', 'most', 'part', 'avoided', 'excessive', 'hyperbole', 'comments', 'sorry', 'excuse', 'film', 'so', 'annoying', 'did', 'provoke', 'degree', 'ire', 'do', 'realize', 'just', 'movie', 'barely', 'not', 'need', 'get', 'wrapped', 'up', 'something', 'as', 'trivial', 'earn', 'recognition', 'sloppiness', 'laziness', 'are', 'acceptable', 'excuses', 'how', 'bad', 'film']",Prison-A-Go-Go!

902635,A26KK6ZU5B3AFJ,B00097E72G,family dogg,"[21, 27]","The women-in-prison film really is its own genre; it's a b-movie tradition that saw its biggest heyday in the 1970's, giving Linda Blair work on more than one occasion. The 80's cult hit ""Reform School Girls"" may have been intended as an homage to such classics as ""Chained Heat"" and ""The Big Bird Cage, but despite its self-aware cheesiness, it is looked upon as more of a late entry to this style of film than some kind of send-up. And that's where Barak Epstein's ""Prison-A-Go-Go"" steps in, to lovingly spoof a genre that has been ripe for it for decades.Laurie Walton stars as Janie, a clueless veterinarian whose sister is kidnapped and taken to a womens' prison in the Philippines (where else?) for use in the bizarre experiments of a mad scientist. In order to save her sister, Janie purposely commits a murder and instantly finds herself on the cell block with an incredibly strange and funny cast of characters (in a prison run by a young slacker who would be better suited to working for Bill Lumberg in ""Office Space"" than functioning as a warden), including the voluptuous sex offender Jackpot (played by USA Up All Night's Rhonda Shear!), and various other women who are addicted to frion, hide things in their asses, and keep porcupines as pets.""Prison-A-Go-Go"" is a 35mm feature that looks and sounds something like a Troma movie, only higher quality and far less disgusting. Director Barak Epstein clearly has a love and healthy respect for the kind of films he's making fun of, and gets everything right: the skimpy uniforms, the food and mud fights, and of course...the obligatory shower scenes. ""Prison-A-Go-Go"" even comes equipped with a ""Shower Clock"" in the lower right hand corner of the screen, so that video viewers on the run know exactly how long till the next time they'll be seeing some bare flesh! And in addition to the mad scientist subplot, Epstein pulls out all the b-movie stops by incorporating zombies, ninjas, and glorious cameos by cult film fixture Mary Woronov and Troma head honcho Lloyd Kaufman.I've seen many unsuccessful attempts at poking fun at b-movies, but nothing has come close to what ""Prison-A-Go-Go"" manages to accomplish. Not only is it one of the most well-made indie comedies I've seen, but it's funny and well-acted at that (everyone is energized and funny, and Rhonda Shear looks even better than she did when I was a kid watching her show). I don't often tell my readers to run out and buy the films I write about, but in this case I really suggest you do. No self-respecting cult film fan should be without ""Prison-A-Go-Go"", because it is clearly made for us by one of us.",4,A well-made WIP send-up,1120608000,"07 6, 2005",2005,2633,"['women-in-prison', 'film', 'really', 'own', 'genre', 'b-movie', 'tradition', 'saw', 'biggest', 'heyday', '1970', 'giving', 'Linda', 'Blair', 'work', 'more', 'one', 'occasion', '80', 'cult', 'hit', 'Reform', 'School', 'Girls', 'may', 'have', 'been', 'intended', 'homage', 'such', 'classics', 'Chained', 'Heat', 'Big', 'Bird', 'Cage', 'self-aware', 'cheesiness', 'looked', 'more', 'late', 'entry', 'style', 'film', 'kind', 'send-up', 'where', 'Barak', 'Epstein', 'Prison-A-Go-Go', 'steps', 'lovingly', 'spoof', 'genre', 'been', 'ripe', 'decades.Laurie', 'Walton', 'stars', 'Janie', 'clueless', 'veterinarian', 'sister', 'kidnapped', 'taken', 'womens', 'prison', 'Philippines', 'where', 'else', 'use', 'bizarre', 'experiments', 'mad', 'scientist', 'order', 'save', 'sister', 'Janie', 'purposely', 'murder', 'instantly', 'cell', 'block', 'incredibly', 'strange', 'funny', 'cast', 'characters', 'prison', 'run', 'young', 'slacker', 'who', 'would', 'be', 'better', 'suited', 'working', 'Bill', 'Lumberg', 'Office', 'Space', 'functioning', 'warden', 'including', 'voluptuous', 'sex', 'offender', 'Jackpot', 'played', 'USA', 'Up', 'All', 'Night', 'Rhonda', 'Shear', 'various', 'other', 'women', 'who', 'are', 'addicted', 'frion', 'hide', 'things', 'asses', 'keep', 'porcupines', 'pets', 'Prison-A-Go-Go', '35mm', 'feature', 'something', 'Troma', 'movie', 'only', 'higher', 'quality', 'far', 'less', 'disgusting', 'Director', 'Barak', 'Epstein', 'clearly', 'love', 'healthy', 'respect', 'kind', 'films', 'making', 'fun', 'everything', 'right', 'skimpy', 'uniforms', 'food', 'mud', 'fights', 'course', 'obligatory', 'shower', 'scenes', 'Prison-A-Go-Go', 'even', 'equipped', 'Shower', 'Clock', 'lower', 'right', 'hand', 'corner', 'screen', 'video', 'viewers', 'run', 'know', 'exactly', 'how', 'long', 'till', 'next', 'time', ""'ll"", 'be', 'seeing', 'bare', 'flesh', 'addition', 'mad', 'scientist', 'subplot', 'Epstein', 'out', 'b-movie', 'stops', 'incorporating', 'zombies', 'ninjas', 'glorious', 'cameos', 'cult', 'film', 'fixture', 'Mary', 'Woronov', 'Troma', 'head', 'honcho', 'Lloyd', 'Kaufman.I', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'many', 'unsuccessful', 'attempts', 'poking', 'fun', 'b-movies', 'nothing', 'come', 'close', 'what', 'Prison-A-Go-Go', 'manages', 'accomplish', 'Not', 'only', 'one', 'most', 'well-made', 'indie', 'comedies', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'funny', 'well-acted', 'everyone', 'energized', 'funny', 'Rhonda', 'Shear', 'even', 'better', 'did', 'when', 'was', 'kid', 'watching', 'show', 'do', ""n't"", 'often', 'tell', 'readers', 'run', 'out', 'buy', 'films', 'write', 'case', 'really', 'suggest', 'do', 'No', 'self-respecting', 'cult', 'film', 'fan', 'should', 'be', 'Prison-A-Go-Go', 'clearly', 'made', 'one']",Prison-A-Go-Go!
