647482,A3EE0H0NWQ9QVL,B00005JPAM,"&#34;Rocky Raccoon&#34; ""Hey, Doc, It's Only ...","[3, 4]","`The Queen' primarily looks behind the scenes of Buckingham Palace during the crisis of Princess Diana's death.  It is an illuminating and comprehensive affair that focuses mainly on the detachment of the Royal family in a time of national grieving.  Like many recent pieces of historical fiction, `The Queen,' wisely uses ample footage from real videotape.  Diana's death, Britain's mourning, and newscasts intersperse the drama.  This works well, and, while some of the screenplay is speculative, they nearly get all of it right.  Peter Morgan is a dead ringer as Prime Minister, Blair, and Helen Mirren is more than reminiscent of Elizabeth II.  Their rendering of Prince Charles (Alex Jennings) is a bullseye.  My only complaint is that, although we see plenty of The Queen's underbelly, her hard-boiled shell is mostly glossed over.  Elizabeth II has shown her vulnerability, but she can be much more indomitable than the drama suggests.  Perhaps this is presented because they couldn't go too far with this drama.  They understandably do try to be fair to the current monarch, even though they present her as grieving more over a slain stag than over any endearment to her estranged daughter-in-law's death.  Her grief is at her own perceived tarnished crown.  The funeral for her is a private affair.  And, here, Blair, who was in tune with the people, properly perceived the Royal Family would miss out on an opportunity to heal the nation.  He really has the dilemma, for he must balance the forces of those who wish to keep the Royal Family dignified and those who call to have their monarchy eliminated.  He draws from the sentiment of the people and properly eulogizes Diana's death, but balances becoming a laison for an institution he prudently realizes will never be put to death anytime soon.Besides ""great performances"" the big draw should be taking in the subplot.  The scenes of Princess Di's private interviews, key scenes in her life, and the aftermath of her death provide the most poignant moments.  This isn't her movie, however, and it should be judged by the terms it was created.  The Queen's perspective brings about its own merits.  For who will not be struck about the state of affairs of England by looking upon the turmoil of the UK's most revered institution when it seems to remain aloof and stoic under the calamity of a competing fallen icon.  Although they prudently only present the suspect aspects that brought Diana's death, the whole picture becomes a fascinating composite of tragedy and regal isolation.",5,Protocol in the Face of Calamity,1163203200,"11 11, 2006",2006,2546,"['Queen', 'primarily', 'scenes', 'Buckingham', 'Palace', 'crisis', 'Princess', 'Diana', 'death', 'illuminating', 'comprehensive', 'affair', 'mainly', 'detachment', 'Royal', 'family', 'time', 'national', 'grieving', 'many', 'recent', 'pieces', 'historical', 'fiction', 'Queen', 'wisely', 'uses', 'ample', 'footage', 'real', 'videotape', 'Diana', 'death', 'Britain', 'mourning', 'newscasts', 'intersperse', 'drama', 'well', 'screenplay', 'speculative', 'nearly', 'get', 'right', 'Peter', 'Morgan', 'dead', 'ringer', 'Prime', 'Minister', 'Blair', 'Helen', 'Mirren', 'more', 'reminiscent', 'Elizabeth', 'II', 'rendering', 'Prince', 'Charles', 'Alex', 'Jennings', 'bullseye', 'only', 'complaint', 'see', 'plenty', 'Queen', 'underbelly', 'hard-boiled', 'shell', 'mostly', 'glossed', 'over', 'Elizabeth', 'II', 'shown', 'vulnerability', 'can', 'be', 'much', 'more', 'indomitable', 'drama', 'Perhaps', 'presented', 'could', ""n't"", 'go', 'too', 'far', 'drama', 'understandably', 'do', 'try', 'be', 'fair', 'current', 'monarch', 'even', 'present', 'grieving', 'more', 'slain', 'stag', 'endearment', 'estranged', 'daughter-in-law', 'death', 'grief', 'own', 'perceived', 'tarnished', 'crown', 'funeral', 'private', 'affair', 'here', 'Blair', 'who', 'was', 'tune', 'people', 'properly', 'perceived', 'Royal', 'Family', 'would', 'miss', 'out', 'opportunity', 'heal', 'nation', 'really', 'dilemma', 'must', 'balance', 'forces', 'who', 'wish', 'keep', 'Royal', 'Family', 'dignified', 'who', 'call', 'have', 'monarchy', 'eliminated', 'sentiment', 'people', 'properly', 'Diana', 'death', 'balances', 'becoming', 'laison', 'institution', 'prudently', 'will', 'never', 'be', 'put', 'death', 'anytime', 'great', 'performances', 'big', 'draw', 'should', 'be', 'taking', 'subplot', 'scenes', 'Princess', 'Di', 'private', 'interviews', 'key', 'scenes', 'life', 'aftermath', 'death', 'provide', 'most', 'poignant', 'moments', ""n't"", 'movie', 'however', 'should', 'be', 'judged', 'terms', 'was', 'created', 'Queen', 'perspective', 'brings', 'own', 'merits', 'who', 'will', 'not', 'be', 'struck', 'state', 'affairs', 'England', 'looking', 'turmoil', 'UK', 'most', 'revered', 'institution', 'when', 'remain', 'aloof', 'stoic', 'calamity', 'competing', 'fallen', 'icon', 'prudently', 'only', 'present', 'suspect', 'aspects', 'brought', 'Diana', 'death', 'whole', 'picture', 'fascinating', 'composite', 'tragedy', 'regal', 'isolation']",The Queen

647487,A3C6X0DAM87GN4,B00005JPAM,Alex Udvary,"[3, 3]","Princess Diana has just died in a terrible car accident, all of London mourns, what exactly should the royal family do, especially when it is well known Diana and Queen Elizabeth II did not get along? According to the Queen, the royal family should show reserve. It is a private matter. Not to mention the issue involving Diana's children. They should not be exposed to the media and the circus which surrounds the situation. No emotion should be shown. A sort of stiff upper lip mentality. That is after all, what Americans think of when we think of the British, isn't it?There is a scene fairly early in the picture when Queen Elizabeth II break down and sheds tears. The camera never shows us her face. The Queen would never express such feelings in public, it simply would not be decent, so the camera man and director Stephen Frears give her, her space.It is because of moments such as this that make ""The Queen"" seem a bit too real. It is a docudrama but somehow it feels like a documentary, we know it's not, but the movie, especially screenwriter Peter Morgan, seem to know too much. How did they acquire this information? This is what I became most impressed with as I watched ""The Queen"".If you haven't heard ""The Queen"" tells the story of how the royal family treated the public outcry concerning Princess Diana's death and the relationship between the Queen and the newly elected Prime Minister, Tony Blair, whom many felt correctly judge the public's ""mood"" in how to handle the tragic accident.Much praise has been thrown Helen Mirren's way for her performance in the film, and she is quite good. Despite playing a real person Mirren doesn't give us an impersonation. She adds something more to the role, truly trying to flesh out the character (I say character because essentially that is what it is. This is a work of fiction despite everything). Some might say Mirren isn't doing much, there is too much restraint. They have a point, but, that's the way the character is presented to us. It is how this character would behave. Therefore it cannot be considered a fault. Instead it is an asset. A tribute to Mirren's performance.But Mirren isn't the only performance worth watching or talking about. The entire cast, from Michael Sheen as Tony Blair, to James Cromwell as Prince Philip and Alex Jennings as Prince Charles. Each actor makes us believe they are the characters they are playing. Cromwell, while a bit more emotion (usually expressing anger) gives the some kind of subtle performance as Mirren. Each character required the same approach.But is there more than meets the eye to Frears' film? Maybe. Would it be out of line to suggest ""The Queen"" is really about Britain's class system? Blair, who won an election based on the assumption he would offer change and fight for the middle-class is constantly at odds with the Queen, as she represents the ""establishment"", the exact people Blair was voted in to take on. But Blair serves as buffer. His character is designed to show us both sides. Without one side, the country would be lost. Gone would be it's history and tradition and without the other, gone would be optimism. The two need each other.Frears for his part he does a great job balancing all of this and gives the film just the right pace. ""The Queen"" never overstays her welcome. While not one of my favorite directors, he has nonetheless directed many entertaining films, which also take on class systems (""Dirty Pretty Things"", ""The Grifters"") but here I think he has outdone himself. This is one of his very best works!Bottom-line: A docudrama that presents itself as a documentary. At times we wonder, how do the filmmakers know this stuff? All of the performances are pitch perfect, with no one stepping over anyone else's toes.

647488,A1LMBOI3T91P87,B00005JPAM,Allan M. Lees,"[3, 3]","It seems a little unfair to rate this movie with only three stars because the direction is assured, the script is intelligent, and the acting is workmanlike in all respects.  As other reviewers have noted, the movie covers the period between British Prime Minister Tony Blair's accession to 10 Downing Street (the home of the British leader) and the aftermath of the death of Princess Diana, formerly the wife of the British heir to the throne, Prince Charles.  The movie resists the temptation to score easy points.  Tony Blair is presented as a rounded character rather than the ""Tony Blur"" he was known as just prior to the 1997 election.  The Queen and the rest of the royal family and their retinue are clearly living in a time warp, utterly out of touch with the rest of humanity, yet the movie doesn't set them up just to knock them down.  In the end the Queen is seen as a tragic sort of character and Tony Blair develops a sincere admiration for her, even as he is frustrated by her inability to grasp the essentials of the situation she faces.So much, so good.  The drawbacks, however, are these: complex relationships have to be encapsulated and summed up in one scene or less.  Thus Prince Charles' resentment over his own childhood is force-fitted into a scene in a Land Rover where he implicitly criticises his mother the Queen by talking about how warm and loving and good a mother his ex-wife Diana was.  Likewise the Queen's sense of being trapped in a role she never wanted is summed up on a Scottish moor, where she sees a magnificent stag.  It represents the freedom she never knew.  No matter how well-intentioned these vignettes are, they are inevitably somewhat clumsy in a movie that is above all else trying to reconstruct real events.The second problem is that when the subjects of a movie are still very much alive and in place, any representation of them treads a fine line between caricature and irrelevance.  Actors have to mimic expressions and manners of speech rather than interpret roles according to their own strengths.  We are always uncomfortably conscious of the fact that the movie Queen looks very like, but not really exactly like, the real Queen.  Likewise the movie Blair is very like, but not really exactly like, the real Prime Minister.  This dissonance is reduced as much as possible by excellent direction, but it is never entirely absent.The result is a very enjoyable movie that brings real warmth and sympathy to almost all the characters we encounter, with the exception of Prince Phillip, husband to the Queen.  By all accounts the real Consort has few if any redeeming features so the movie reasonably enough doesn't stretch our credulity by trying to imply there might be some lurking deep out of sight.Definitely watch this movie if you have any interest at all in contemporary social events in Britain - it's probably as realistic a depiction of some fascinating people as we are likely to get.  But in the end, while it succeeds as a humanistic undertaking, it somehow just falls short as art.",3,"Sturdy, balanced, workmanlike",1180656000,"06 1, 2007",2007,3052,"['little', 'unfair', 'rate', 'movie', 'only', 'three', 'stars', 'direction', 'assured', 'script', 'intelligent', 'acting', 'workmanlike', 'respects', 'other', 'reviewers', 'have', 'noted', 'movie', 'period', 'British', 'Prime', 'Minister', 'Tony', 'Blair', 'accession', '10', 'Downing', 'Street', 'home', 'British', 'leader', 'aftermath', 'death', 'Princess', 'Diana', 'formerly', 'wife', 'British', 'heir', 'throne', 'Prince', 'Charles', 'movie', 'temptation', 'score', 'easy', 'points', 'Tony', 'Blair', 'presented', 'rounded', 'character', 'rather', 'Tony', 'Blur', 'was', 'known', 'just', 'prior', '1997', 'election', 'Queen', 'rest', 'royal', 'family', 'retinue', 'are', 'clearly', 'living', 'time', 'warp', 'utterly', 'touch', 'rest', 'humanity', 'movie', ""n't"", 'set', 'up', 'just', 'knock', 'down', 'end', 'Queen', 'seen', 'tragic', 'sort', 'character', 'Tony', 'Blair', 'sincere', 'admiration', 'even', 'frustrated', 'inability', 'grasp', 'essentials', 'situation', 'faces.So', 'much', 'so', 'good', 'drawbacks', 'however', 'are', 'complex', 'relationships', 'have', 'be', 'encapsulated', 'summed', 'up', 'one', 'scene', 'less', 'Thus', 'Prince', 'Charles', 'resentment', 'own', 'childhood', 'force-fitted', 'scene', 'Land', 'Rover', 'where', 'implicitly', 'mother', 'Queen', 'talking', 'how', 'warm', 'loving', 'good', 'mother', 'ex-wife', 'Diana', 'was', 'Likewise', 'Queen', 'sense', 'being', 'trapped', 'role', 'never', 'wanted', 'summed', 'up', 'Scottish', 'moor', 'where', 'magnificent', 'stag', 'freedom', 'never', 'knew', 'matter', 'how', 'well-intentioned', 'vignettes', 'are', 'are', 'inevitably', 'somewhat', 'clumsy', 'movie', 'else', 'trying', 'reconstruct', 'real', 'events.The', 'second', 'problem', 'when', 'subjects', 'movie', 'are', 'still', 'very', 'much', 'alive', 'place', 'representation', 'fine', 'line', 'caricature', 'irrelevance', 'Actors', 'have', 'mimic', 'expressions', 'manners', 'speech', 'rather', 'interpret', 'roles', 'according', 'own', 'strengths', 'are', 'always', 'uncomfortably', 'conscious', 'fact', 'movie', 'Queen', 'very', 'like', 'not', 'really', 'exactly', 'real', 'Queen', 'Likewise', 'movie', 'Blair', 'very', 'like', 'not', 'really', 'exactly', 'real', 'Prime', 'Minister', 'dissonance', 'reduced', 'as', 'much', 'possible', 'excellent', 'direction', 'never', 'entirely', 'absent.The', 'result', 'very', 'enjoyable', 'movie', 'real', 'warmth', 'sympathy', 'almost', 'characters', 'encounter', 'exception', 'Prince', 'Phillip', 'husband', 'Queen', 'accounts', 'real', 'Consort', 'few', 'redeeming', 'features', 'movie', 'reasonably', 'enough', ""n't"", 'stretch', 'credulity', 'trying', 'imply', 'might', 'be', 'lurking', 'deep', 'sight.Definitely', 'watch', 'movie', 'have', 'interest', 'contemporary', 'social', 'events', 'Britain', 'probably', 'realistic', 'depiction', 'fascinating', 'people', 'are', 'likely', 'get', 'end', 'humanistic', 'undertaking', 'somehow', 'just', 'short', 'art']",The Queen

I must admit that, at the time and still to this day, I cannot myself understand why so many people fell for Diana.  She was an intellectual lightweight who could be moody and self-indulgent.  Her end should have been little more than a historical footnote.  The fact that it wasn't is the real conundrum.Helen Mirren is brilliant as the Queen.  She is totally plausible.  Indeed, the whole cast is quite stunning.  The cast allows the events to unfold while the viewer is swept along for the ride.  And a great ride it is!

Now I am never the one to follow my parent's advice, especially when it comes to entertainment, but there was something about this movie that screamed `TV Movie' to me and so I just didn't expect to like it much at all.  My wife wanted to see it though and so I conceded, and I must admit that since I love everything Oscar and feel this incessant need to embrace all that they embrace, at least so I can form an opinion, I wasn't hesitant about sitting down to watch the film.What I found though was a brilliantly crafted biopic that held my interest and proved to be highly entertaining.The film follows the days preceding the untimely death of Princess Diana and the media coverage of the Royal families reaction, or lack there of.  Young Tony Blair had just been elected Prime Minister before the tragedy and thus finds himself dealing with some very touchy issues very early on in his career.  The film does a fair job of trying to flesh out the motives of the royal family, especially those of the Queen herself, trying to make her appear real to the audience and maybe explain her strange behavior following the death of Princess Diana.This fleshing out of the Queen is due to the amazing portrayal by Oscar winner Helen Mirren.  This was a very challenging role even though it won't appear that way.  When watching Mirren converse and interact on the screen you will see no hysterics, no outburst of emotion, nothing that screams Oscar.  What you will see is a woman dealing with the situation that lay before her, the people in her life telling her one thing and another as well as her own thoughts and feelings on the matter.  What you will see is the buried emotion that hides behind her eyes as she takes in everything but never divulges a single emotion.  This my friends is very hard to do.  Hysterics and outbursts may be difficult to tame and make believable but completely reserved emotion is just as hard to accomplish.  Helen Mirren soars in this regard.The rest of the cast hold there own as well, especially Michael Sheen who portrays Tony Blair as both thoughtful and understanding.  Blair is probably the most well rounded character aside from the Queen herself here, the balance of the cast falling a bit into the background proving to be more or less accessories to the two main characters.  James Cromwell and Sylvia Syms do excellent work here as Prince Philip and the Queen Mother (was it just me or did they make Helen Mirren up to look OLDER than Syms who was playing her mother), both providing some explanation as to the Queens actions that given week.  Both Philip and Elizabeth are portrayed as very headstrong and somewhat tactless individuals whose contempt for Diana spilled over into their reaction to her death.  Prince Charles is portrayed rather sympathetically by Alex Jennings who seemed to capture the essence that was and is Charles beautifully.Stephen Frears and Peter Morgan should be singled out though for helming the creation of this film.  Frears direction only magnifies the brilliance of Morgan's script that is both accurate (all biopics fail to be completely accurate, but in Hollywood terms this is quite good), witty, funny and engaging as well as educational for it helps the general public understand a little better a woman that not too many fully understand.  I won't deny the fact that, at times, `The Queen' does play out like a `TV Movie' for its production is not as polished as one might expect, but that in the end may be part of its appeal.  The lack of polish helps to keep the focus on the acting, which is miles above those found in `TV Movies'.I am not one who believes Helen Mirren gave the best performance of the year or even of her five fellow nominees but now that I have witnessed her performance I can't say that I am upset with her win either.  She showed true strength and temperance with her delivery and was commanding without being showy.`The Queen' is a movie I am glad to have seen and one that I will most likely see again for it proved to be much better than I had expected and delivered much more than I thought it could.  Is it in my top ten of the year?  No, but it is one of those `honorable mentions' that is worth just about everyone's time.",4,Sheds a light of understanding on a situation the world decided to judge...,1193616000,"10 29, 2007",2007,4432,"['Going', 'Queen', 'was', ""n't"", 'really', 'expecting', 'much', 'parents', 'had', 'seen', 'film', 'disliked', 'greatly', 'sighting', 'was', 'boring', 'slow', 'moving', 'nothing', 'had', 'expected', 'Now', 'am', 'never', 'one', 'follow', 'parent', 'advice', 'especially', 'when', 'entertainment', 'was', 'something', 'movie', 'screamed', 'TV', 'Movie', 'so', 'just', 'did', ""n't"", 'expect', 'like', 'much', 'wife', 'wanted', 'see', 'so', 'conceded', 'must', 'admit', 'love', 'everything', 'Oscar', 'feel', 'incessant', 'need', 'embrace', 'embrace', 'least', 'so', 'can', 'form', 'opinion', 'was', ""n't"", 'hesitant', 'sitting', 'down', 'watch', 'film.What', 'found', 'was', 'brilliantly', 'crafted', 'biopic', 'held', 'interest', 'proved', 'be', 'highly', 'entertaining.The', 'film', 'days', 'preceding', 'untimely', 'death', 'Princess', 'Diana', 'media', 'coverage', 'Royal', 'families', 'reaction', 'lack', 'Young', 'Tony', 'Blair', 'had', 'just', 'been', 'elected', 'Prime', 'Minister', 'tragedy', 'thus', 'dealing', 'very', 'touchy', 'issues', 'very', 'early', 'career', 'film', 'fair', 'job', 'trying', 'flesh', 'out', 'motives', 'royal', 'family', 'especially', 'Queen', 'trying', 'make', 'appear', 'real', 'audience', 'maybe', 'explain', 'strange', 'behavior', 'following', 'death', 'Princess', 'Diana.This', 'fleshing', 'Queen', 'due', 'amazing', 'portrayal', 'Oscar', 'winner', 'Helen', 'Mirren', 'was', 'very', 'challenging', 'role', 'even', 'wo', ""n't"", 'appear', 'way', 'When', 'watching', 'Mirren', 'converse', 'interact', 'screen', 'will', 'see', 'hysterics', 'outburst', 'emotion', 'nothing', 'Oscar', 'What', 'will', 'see', 'woman', 'dealing', 'situation', 'lay', 'people', 'life', 'telling', 'one', 'thing', 'as', 'well', 'own', 'thoughts', 'feelings', 'matter', 'What', 'will', 'see', 'buried', 'emotion', 'eyes', 'everything', 'never', 'single', 'emotion', 'friends', 'very', 'hard', 'do', 'Hysterics', 'outbursts', 'may', 'be', 'difficult', 'tame', 'make', 'believable', 'completely', 'reserved', 'emotion', 'just', 'as', 'hard', 'accomplish', 'Helen', 'Mirren', 'regard.The', 'rest', 'cast', 'hold', 'there', 'own', 'as', 'well', 'especially', 'Michael', 'Sheen', 'who', 'Tony', 'Blair', 'thoughtful', 'understanding', 'Blair', 'probably', 'most', 'well', 'rounded', 'character', 'aside', 'Queen', 'here', 'balance', 'cast', 'falling', 'bit', 'background', 'proving', 'be', 'more', 'less', 'accessories', 'two', 'main', 'characters', 'James', 'Cromwell', 'Sylvia', 'Syms', 'do', 'excellent', 'work', 'here', 'Prince', 'Philip', 'Queen', 'Mother', 'was', 'just', 'did', 'make', 'Helen', 'Mirren', 'look', 'OLDER', 'Syms', 'who', 'was', 'playing', 'mother', 'providing', 'explanation', 'Queens', 'actions', 'given', 'week', 'Philip', 'Elizabeth', 'are', 'portrayed', 'very', 'headstrong', 'somewhat', 'tactless', 'individuals', 'contempt', 'Diana', 'spilled', 'over', 'reaction', 'death', 'Prince', 'Charles', 'portrayed', 'rather', 'sympathetically', 'Alex', 'Jennings', 'who', 'seemed', 'capture', 'essence', 'was', 'Charles', 'beautifully.Stephen', 'Frears', 'Peter', 'Morgan', 'should', 'be', 'singled', 'out', 'helming', 'creation', 'film', 'Frears', 'direction', 'only', 'brilliance', 'Morgan', 'script', 'accurate', 'biopics', 'fail', 'be', 'completely', 'accurate', 'Hollywood', 'terms', 'quite', 'good', 'witty', 'funny', 'engaging', 'as', 'well', 'educational', 'general', 'public', 'understand', 'little', 'better', 'woman', 'not', 'too', 'many', 'fully', 'understand', 'wo', ""n't"", 'deny', 'fact', 'times', 'Queen', 'play', 'out', 'TV', 'Movie', 'production', 'not', 'as', 'polished', 'one', 'might', 'expect', 'end', 'may', 'be', 'part', 'appeal', 'lack', 'polish', 'helps', 'keep', 'focus', 'acting', 'miles', 'found', 'TV', ""Movies'.I"", 'am', 'not', 'one', 'who', 'Helen', 'Mirren', 'gave', 'best', 'performance', 'year', 'even', 'five', 'fellow', 'nominees', 'now', 'have', 'witnessed', 'performance', 'ca', ""n't"", 'say', 'am', 'upset', 'win', 'either', 'showed', 'true', 'strength', 'temperance', 'delivery', 'was', 'commanding', 'being', 'showy.', 'Queen', 'movie', 'am', 'glad', 'have', 'seen', 'one', 'will', 'most', 'likely', 'see', 'again', 'proved', 'be', 'much', 'better', 'had', 'expected', 'delivered', 'much', 'more', 'thought', 'could', 'Is', 'top', 'ten', 'year', 'No', 'one', 'honorable', 'mentions', 'worth', 'just', 'everyone', 'time']",The Queen
647493,A2QHM5HBSIXRL4,B00005JPAM,Andy Orrock,"[134, 153]","Helen Mirren is getting the requisite kudos for her portrayal of Queen Elizabeth.  But there's another portrayal in Stephen Frears' excellent film of an equally public figure that is going relatively overlooked: Michael Sheen's spot-on take on Tony Blair.  I was totally mesmerized at just how perfectly Sheen had both the look and feel of the unbridled optimism of TB at the outset of his first term.  That's key because it's Blair's intuition on  the matters at hand here that are instrumental in shaking the Royal Family out of their tone-deaf dismissal of the unfolding events across the country.It's interesting to see the portrayals here and see how harsh or sympathetic they are (Mirren's Elizabeth is complex and beyond analysis here):Prince Philip - A devastating take on himPrice Charles - Painted very sympathetically by Alex Jennings, but obviously cowed by his motherAlastair Campbell - A very positive take on New Labour's wordsmith by Mark Bazeley (I'm a big Campbell fan, so it was good to see the script honor his contributions to Blair's early successes).Queen Mom - Yikes!  Not a very pretty pictureFrears' delicate and respectful approach keeps William and Harry just off the picture.What will really take you about the movie is this: as many reviewers here note, they found themselves strangely moved and shocked by Diana's death, like she was a member of the family.  When those scenes play out here, wow, you'll be quite surprised at the emotions that well up in you.  It will happen.  Trust me.Frears - as pitch-perfect movie helmsman - includes the stirring end portion of the eulogy penned and intoned by Charles, Earl of Spencer (Diana's brother).  Spencer's speech is generally regarded as one of the finest eulogies ever rendered.  It has become a part of British textbooks.  Here's the part you hear in the movie:""I would like to end by thanking God for the small mercies he has shown us at this dreadful time. For taking Diana at her most beautiful and radiant and when she had joy in her private life. Above all we give thanks for the life of a woman I am so proud to be able to call my sister, the unique, the complex, the extraordinary and irreplaceable Diana whose beauty, both internal and external, will never be extinguished from our minds.""That will send a chill up your spine when you see it in the theater.",5,"Mirren, yes...but a word about Michael Sheen's great TB",1162684800,"11 5, 2006",2006,2347,"['Helen', 'Mirren', 'getting', 'requisite', 'kudos', 'portrayal', 'Queen', 'Elizabeth', 'portrayal', 'Stephen', 'Frears', 'excellent', 'film', 'equally', 'public', 'figure', 'going', 'relatively', 'overlooked', 'Michael', 'Sheen', 'spot-on', 'take', 'Tony', 'Blair', 'was', 'totally', 'mesmerized', 'just', 'how', 'perfectly', 'Sheen', 'had', 'look', 'feel', 'unbridled', 'optimism', 'TB', 'outset', 'first', 'term', 'key', 'Blair', 'intuition', 'matters', 'hand', 'here', 'are', 'instrumental', 'shaking', 'Royal', 'Family', 'tone-deaf', 'dismissal', 'unfolding', 'events', 'country.It', 'interesting', 'see', 'portrayals', 'here', 'see', 'how', 'harsh', 'sympathetic', 'are', 'Mirren', 'Elizabeth', 'complex', 'analysis', 'here', 'Prince', 'Philip', 'devastating', 'take', 'himPrice', 'Charles', 'Painted', 'very', 'sympathetically', 'Alex', 'Jennings', 'obviously', 'cowed', 'motherAlastair', 'Campbell', 'very', 'positive', 'take', 'New', 'Labour', 'wordsmith', 'Mark', 'Bazeley', ""'m"", 'big', 'Campbell', 'fan', 'was', 'good', 'see', 'script', 'honor', 'contributions', 'Blair', 'early', 'successes', '.Queen', 'Mom', 'Yikes', 'Not', 'very', 'pretty', 'pictureFrears', 'delicate', 'respectful', 'approach', 'William', 'Harry', 'just', 'picture.What', 'will', 'really', 'take', 'movie', 'many', 'reviewers', 'here', 'note', 'found', 'strangely', 'moved', 'shocked', 'Diana', 'death', 'was', 'member', 'family', 'When', 'scenes', 'play', 'out', 'here', 'wow', ""'ll"", 'be', 'quite', 'surprised', 'emotions', 'well', 'up', 'will', 'happen', 'Trust', 'pitch-perfect', 'movie', 'helmsman', 'stirring', 'end', 'portion', 'eulogy', 'penned', 'intoned', 'Charles', 'Earl', 'Spencer', 'Diana', 'brother', 'Spencer', 'speech', 'generally', 'regarded', 'one', 'finest', 'eulogies', 'ever', 'rendered', 'become', 'part', 'British', 'textbooks', 'Here', 'part', 'hear', 'movie', 'would', 'like', 'end', 'thanking', 'God', 'small', 'mercies', 'shown', 'dreadful', 'time', 'taking', 'Diana', 'most', 'beautiful', 'radiant', 'when', 'had', 'joy', 'private', 'life', 'give', 'thanks', 'life', 'woman', 'am', 'so', 'proud', 'be', 'able', 'call', 'sister', 'unique', 'complex', 'extraordinary', 'irreplaceable', 'Diana', 'beauty', 'internal', 'external', 'will', 'never', 'be', 'extinguished', 'minds', 'will', 'send', 'chill', 'up', 'spine', 'when', 'see', 'theater']",The Queen

The title of this movie was deceptive as it concentrated almost exclusively on the week after Daian was killed in the car crash in Paris.  When I bought the ticket, I said ""I have come to see the Queen.""We met her (played superbly by Helen Mirren) on Tony Blair's first day in office.  After being elected as Prime Minister of Britain, he is shown down on his knee asking Queen Elizabeth's permission to be ""her"" Prime Minister.  It was a factitious meeting to say the least.The actor who portrasyed Blair was cute (showed a lot of teeth) and matured as the events occurred and he had to speak to the world on the family's behalf.  He was marvelous.  Diana died August 30, 1997, a lovely but deluded young woman who'd been ostracized by the royal family.  The monarchy watched t.v. like the rest of the world as they stayed in seclusion out in the country.  The Queen had deemed it a private Spenser family funeral, even though Charles had to remind her  of their responsibility, that Diana had been the loving mother of the future King of England.As the Queen finally came to terms that she must make an appearance by September 4th, as worldwide disapproval was increasing, she shed a few tears (as I did when my ex mother-in-law died) and a beautiful stag appeared as a prominition.  It showed her humanity, though the whole family were old fashioned and set in their ways:  harsh, uncaring, in denial, thinking only of themselves instead of the two sons of Diana.Blair carried on in a remarkably mature manner which won him many American admirers; almost ten years since those happenings, and he will retire in 2007.  He is almost as great now as Winston Churchill, even with his pajama top on which BLAIR was on the back.  He had a supportive wife and called Diana ""the people's princess.""  Plans were changed from private to a public funeral despite the Queen's cold attitute.It was very moving to see her looking at the mountain of flowers outside the gates of Balmoral Castle and to have her stand, ""the flag,"" at half staff.  It was a minute-by-minute, day by day account of that terrible tragedy and repercussions in September, 1997.  We will always remember the televised coverage just as we watched the beautiful wedding some years prior, which led up to this miserable day, and the funeral proceedings of JFK in 1962.Some things are so remarkable that you can't get them erased from your memory, and the pain is always there.  I wasn't expecting this when I went to the movie, as I avoid painful memories in my subconscious as much as I can.

Merritt ""filmreviewstew.com""","[3, 10]","Sometimes it's a hit or miss with directors, and with Stephen Frears at the helm the odds of a film being a success versus failure are about fifty/fifty. He has given us some excellent cinema such as High Fidelity, Dangerous Liaisons, and The Grifters. But sometimes his movie eye misses the mark or lacks an intriguing or well-rounded story. Mrs. Henderson Presents, Mary Reilly, and Hero are just a sprinkling of Frear films that had a good shot at being great, but ultimately failed in coherency, pacing, or some other aspect.THE QUEEN is certainly a film with some great acting. Helen Mirren is spot-on as Queen Elizabeth II, as was Michael Sheen in his portrayal of Tony Blair. But from here the cast sags quite a bit. James Cromwell picked up the part of Prince Philip, but seemed very out of place since he has been typecast in such things as The West Wing TV series and The Sum of All Fears flick. And Sylvia Syms (as The Queen Mother) and Alex Jennings (as Prince Charles) were difficult to see in their respective roles since they are still in the public eye. Although Queen Elizabeth is still in the spotlight, Helen Mirren's strong portrayal made that role much easier to swallow.Fresh subjects are tough to hit upon anyway, and you have to give credit where it is due; Stephen Frears certainly deserves some acclaim for simply attempting to make a film about the Royal Family and their reaction (or non-reaction) to Princess Diana's accidental death. But herein lies another problem: plot. There isn't one. The Queen is a reactionary tale, focusing mainly on Queen Elizabeth and the newly installed Prime Minister Tony Blair, and how each of them views the country's response to Di's death. Of course, the Queen deals with it by not dealing with it. While Mr. Blair continually tries to save the monarchy from self-destructing due to their own ignorance of the peoples' grief. But there isn't a definitive beginning, middle and ending to the story. It's character study of the monarchy will probably be boring to many, especially in the beginning. Most viewers may feel like dozing off after the first twenty minutes of disinteresting royal uppityness.Although the beginning and middle of the film lag, the ending picks up just enough to make it watchable. The excellent shots of Balmoral Castle and its Scottish surroundings were fairly awesome, as were some analogies regarding the royal deer that roam the outback wildlands.If you enjoy a good modern day character study, and are interested in the current monarchy, you'll probably eat this film up. But if you're eager for something plot-driven and deeply intriguing, you best look elsewhere.",3,Is It a Hit?

647504,A2CRTN7BI7YNMA,B00005JPAM,Book Reviewer 2009,"[2, 2]","In 1997, the world received the shocking news of the sudden death of Princess Diana.  This fascinating movie examines the chasm that opened between Queen Elizabeth II and the British public when she underestimated their grief and failed to react to Diana's death in a manner that they deemed appropriate.  Caught between queen and subjects is newly elected prime minister Tony Blair (looking about 22 years old, and played to perfection by lookalike Michael Sheen).When the news of Princess Diana's death in a car crash in Paris reaches England, the prime minister immediately contacts the press with a statement of grief.  The royal family, on the other hand, are vacationing in Scotland.  Not only do they display no reaction to Diana's death whatsoever, they do not even cut their holiday short and return to Buckingham Palace until they are good and ready.  Things continue to get tense as the British public gets no statement or reaction from the royals.  The grief-stricken British spontaneously bury the street outside Buckingham Palace in flowers for Diana.  The tabloids chronicle their growing animosity towards the queen.Meanwhile, the Queen sits alone, watching video footage of Diana on television, analyzing Diana's every move with a brooding squint that speaks volumes.  She seems jealous, regretful, and deeply puzzled by the ""people's princess.""  Helen Mirren doesn't exactly look like Elizabeth, but she has her mannerisms, her accent, and her dowdy but impeccable wardrobe precisely nailed down.  Through Mirren's subtle but powerful performance, you become aware that the queen comes from a different, more stoic generation than did Diana.  Like Diana, the queen also served as a symbol of England and its heroic endurance during the Second World War.Only the prime minister seems to understand the queen's side of things.  One of the great pleasures of the movie is seeing him mediate between the queen and her subjects, attempting to repair the growing rift.Every great character study has an unforgettable scene:  the one in this movie is where Tony Blair after having been voted into office still must observe the tradition of going to see the queen and asking her to accept him as her prime minister.  He does this, and she - in a priceless exchange invoking the memory of Winston Churchill - puts him firmly in his place.

And we can see that Tony's wife does not think much of the queen. (Her translation of the queen's words would probably not be allowed here!)From here, we see Dianne's fatal accident, and while the queen acknowledges the tragedy, Prince Charles is the only one who feels that Dianne has to be treated with royal respect even though she is an X princess.)The major plot of this movie is that the royal family has an unprecedented circumstance here. The death of an X princess who was popular. Add to that that Tony Blair is just settling in, and he knows that certain parties are wondering as to the usefulness of the monarchy. (So things are unstable.)Without going on for too long, her majesty Queen Elizabeth II has legitimate reasons to dislike Dianne. And to complicate things further, she tries to gain control of the situation the way she has in the past. (Remaining unaffected.)Prince Charles receives gentle treatment in this film. He seems to know 2 major things. (1) For the monarch to survive, it must be willing to be flexible with the times. (2) Even more important, unlike his mother, Charles is aware that the Dianne they knew is NOT the Dianne the majority of people knew.While the movie is called ""The Queen,"" one could easily argue that the true star is Tony Blair. He's a competent young Prime Minister who agrees with progression, but he also has a respect for traditions as well as the monarchy. While his wife is anti monarchist, Tony knows that England has a need for the monarchy and they (for the most part) want the monarchy: ""Spare me the 'off with their heads' routine.""At one point, Tony has to (with some regret) 'strong arm' the Queen to take required action about Dianne. Perhaps the most moving point in this film is when after doing this difficult action, Tony Blair faces down the hostile press and explains that Queen Elizabeth II never wanted this job, that she watched it kill her father King George VI, and that she did the job she never wanted with dignity and grace for almost 50 years.Tony also reminds the 'wicked press' that Dianne: ""...threw everything the queen offered back in her face, and for the past few years dedicated her life 24/7 to destroying everything the queen held dear.""Keeping this final and climactic speech of Tony Blair in mind, makes watching this film a 2nd time all the more interesting.If you are a fan of English History, you MUST have this film.",5,Long Live Queen Elizabeth II!,1260144000,"12 7, 2009",2009,2597,"['depressing', 'phenomenal', 'film.Very', 'quickly', 'really', 'need', 'see', 'film', 'hindsight', 'appreciate', 'fully.The', 'film', 'Tony', 'Blair', 'rise', 'power', 'can', 'see', 'Tony', 'wife', 'not', 'think', 'much', 'queen', 'translation', 'queen', 'words', 'would', 'probably', 'not', 'be', 'allowed', 'here', 'here', 'see', 'Dianne', 'fatal', 'accident', 'queen', 'tragedy', 'Prince', 'Charles', 'only', 'one', 'who', 'Dianne', 'be', 'treated', 'royal', 'respect', 'even', 'X', 'princess', 'major', 'plot', 'movie', 'royal', 'family', 'unprecedented', 'circumstance', 'here', 'death', 'X', 'princess', 'who', 'was', 'popular', 'Add', 'Tony', 'Blair', 'just', 'settling', 'certain', 'parties', 'are', 'wondering', 'usefulness', 'monarchy', 'things', 'are', 'unstable', 'going', 'too', 'long', 'majesty', 'Queen', 'Elizabeth', 'II', 'legitimate', 'reasons', 'dislike', 'Dianne', 'complicate', 'things', 'further', 'gain', 'control', 'situation', 'way', 'past', 'Remaining', 'unaffected', 'Prince', 'Charles', 'gentle', 'treatment', 'film', 'know', '2', 'major', 'things', '1', 'monarch', 'survive', 'must', 'be', 'willing', 'be', 'flexible', 'times', '2', 'Even', 'more', 'important', 'mother', 'Charles', 'aware', 'Dianne', 'knew', 'NOT', 'Dianne', 'majority', 'people', 'knew.While', 'movie', 'called', 'Queen', 'one', 'could', 'easily', 'argue', 'true', 'star', 'Tony', 'Blair', 'competent', 'young', 'Prime', 'Minister', 'who', 'progression', 'also', 'respect', 'traditions', 'as', 'well', 'monarchy', 'wife', 'anti', 'monarchist', 'Tony', 'England', 'need', 'monarchy', 'most', 'part', 'want', 'monarchy', 'Spare', ""'off"", 'heads', 'routine', 'one', 'point', 'Tony', 'regret', 'arm', 'Queen', 'take', 'required', 'action', 'Dianne', 'Perhaps', 'most', 'moving', 'point', 'film', 'when', 'doing', 'difficult', 'action', 'Tony', 'Blair', 'down', 'hostile', 'press', 'Queen', 'Elizabeth', 'II', 'never', 'wanted', 'job', 'watched', 'kill', 'father', 'King', 'George', 'VI', 'did', 'job', 'never', 'wanted', 'dignity', 'grace', 'almost', '50', 'years.Tony', 'also', ""'wicked"", 'press', 'Dianne', 'threw', 'everything', 'queen', 'offered', 'back', 'face', 'past', 'few', 'years', 'dedicated', 'life', '24/7', 'destroying', 'everything', 'queen', 'held', 'dear', 'Keeping', 'final', 'climactic', 'speech', 'Tony', 'Blair', 'mind', 'watching', 'film', '2nd', 'time', 'more', 'interesting.If', 'are', 'fan', 'English', 'History', 'MUST', 'have', 'film']",The Queen

And, in this film--however much a cliche it is to repeat--she IS the Queen.  Though the role is a natural for the very English actress, her study of Elizabeth II misses not a single beat, from the monarch's ages-old regal bearing to her endearingly quirky styles of pocketbooks and headscarves.Mirren's character, however, comes across in many ways as a minor one.  The major thrust of the movie is the role (supposedly) played by Tony Blair in the events following Diana's death, and thus he emerges as the principal protagonist.  Michael Sheen's portrait of the prime minister is engaging and well done, but the attempt of the film's creators to put this slant on the action pushes the plot toward a suspiciously leftist turn that taints the storyline.  With his wife as a to-the-max classic foil, the white-knight PM expounds upon his reasons for saving the royals from themselves, and--if one is to believe this movie's premise--does so.The film's other major flaw regards the renditions of Prince Charles and the Queen Mother.  Though Prince Philip is perfectly cast and portrayed by James Cromwell, the choice of Alex Jennings and Sylvia Syms as the former personages seems odd from the outset, and the scripting and direction under which they wilt has to make the viewer wonder whether sheer ignorance or outright agenda is to blame.  The portrayals appear so unlike the actual strong-willed and rigid-spined individuals that only stark circumstance or referral by name make them recognizable.  Charles is rendered as retiring, wavering, and ineffectual, his visage endlessly pinched by an unripe-persimmon-sucking grimace.  He is said to fear assassination--and better the Queen than he--when, in reality, the man failed to even flinch when shot at in Australia.  While he appears to be the royal who popularized the among-the-people walkabouts and reportedly goaded the Queen into action after Diana's death, these feats are credited to Blair in the movie.  And the Queen Mum, the redoubtable dowager who remained stylish and pump-shod into her 90's, comes off as doughy and shambling and little more than a sounding board for her daughter.  And the character's assertion that the monarchy will be in peril when Charles--purportedly her favorite grandchild--takes the throne?  Only the strange and fictional Charles of this film.Of course, the feature's creators would undoubtedly admit to a great deal of embellishing and fleshing-out fiction.  It goes too far, though, in the implication that the Queen had not mingled with the common folk since World War II or that the emotional implications of hunting had never crossed her mind.  And, given that the main enjoyment of this feature comes from Mirren's amazingly exacting portrayal, it seems a shame that all the depictions are not as diligently pursued.",4,The Prime Minister--or How Tony Blair Saved the Monarchy,1181952000,"06 16, 2007",2007,2932,"['Helen', 'Mirren', 'never', 'Even', 'bleakest', 'thespian', 'venues', 'i.e', 'Shadowboxer', 'efforts', 'shine', 'forth', 'film', 'however', 'much', 'cliche', 'repeat', 'Queen', 'role', 'natural', 'very', 'English', 'actress', 'study', 'Elizabeth', 'II', 'not', 'single', 'beat', 'monarch', 'ages-old', 'regal', 'bearing', 'endearingly', 'quirky', 'styles', 'pocketbooks', 'headscarves.Mirren', 'character', 'however', 'many', 'ways', 'minor', 'one', 'major', 'thrust', 'movie', 'role', 'supposedly', 'played', 'Tony', 'Blair', 'events', 'following', 'Diana', 'death', 'thus', 'principal', 'protagonist', 'Michael', 'Sheen', 'portrait', 'prime', 'minister', 'engaging', 'well', 'done', 'attempt', 'film', 'creators', 'put', 'slant', 'action', 'plot', 'suspiciously', 'leftist', 'turn', 'storyline', 'wife', 'to-the-max', 'classic', 'foil', 'white-knight', 'PM', 'reasons', 'saving', 'royals', 'one', 'believe', 'movie', 'premise', 'so.The', 'film', 'other', 'major', 'flaw', 'renditions', 'Prince', 'Charles', 'Queen', 'Mother', 'Though', 'Prince', 'Philip', 'perfectly', 'cast', 'portrayed', 'James', 'Cromwell', 'choice', 'Alex', 'Jennings', 'Sylvia', 'Syms', 'former', 'personages', 'odd', 'outset', 'scripting', 'direction', 'wilt', 'make', 'viewer', 'wonder', 'sheer', 'ignorance', 'outright', 'agenda', 'blame', 'portrayals', 'appear', 'so', 'actual', 'strong-willed', 'rigid-spined', 'individuals', 'only', 'stark', 'circumstance', 'referral', 'name', 'make', 'recognizable', 'Charles', 'rendered', 'retiring', 'wavering', 'ineffectual', 'visage', 'endlessly', 'pinched', 'unripe-persimmon-sucking', 'grimace', 'said', 'fear', 'assassination', 'better', 'Queen', 'when', 'reality', 'man', 'failed', 'even', 'flinch', 'when', 'shot', 'Australia', 'be', 'royal', 'who', 'popularized', 'among-the-people', 'walkabouts', 'reportedly', 'goaded', 'Queen', 'action', 'Diana', 'death', 'feats', 'are', 'credited', 'Blair', 'movie', 'Queen', 'Mum', 'redoubtable', 'dowager', 'who', 'remained', 'stylish', 'pump-shod', '90', 'off', 'doughy', 'shambling', 'little', 'more', 'sounding', 'board', 'daughter', 'character', 'assertion', 'monarchy', 'will', 'be', 'peril', 'when', 'Charles', 'purportedly', 'favorite', 'grandchild', 'throne', 'Only', 'strange', 'fictional', 'Charles', 'film.Of', 'course', 'feature', 'creators', 'would', 'undoubtedly', 'admit', 'great', 'deal', 'embellishing', 'fleshing-out', 'fiction', 'too', 'far', 'though', 'implication', 'Queen', 'had', 'not', 'mingled', 'common', 'folk', 'World', 'War', 'II', 'emotional', 'implications', 'hunting', 'had', 'never', 'crossed', 'mind', 'given', 'main', 'enjoyment', 'feature', 'Mirren', 'amazingly', 'exacting', 'portrayal', 'shame', 'depictions', 'are', 'not', 'diligently', 'pursued']",The Queen
647514,A3VIOCJZ22JZXT,B00005JPAM,C. B Collins Jr.,"[1, 1]","This is an excellent, highly entertaining film. It has a smartly written script that is humorous and never lags; excellent sequencing and editing to keep the viewer fully engaged; exceptional acting from Helen Mirren, James Cromwell, and Michael Sheen; and an underlying theme of adaptive leadership that is superbly and seamlessly integrated into the narrative. It is the theme of adaptive leadership, exhibited first by Tony Blair and later by Queen Elisabeth, on which I would like to comment.Everyone knows the story here of the tragic death of Princess Diana, the outpouring of public grief, and the failure of reaction on the part of the Windsors.  What is not as well known is the story behind the action where Tony Blair, the new Prime Minister, was able to gradually move Queen Elisabeth to comprehend the public mood and to respond to that mood appropriately. Both characters display the adaptive leadership and necessary flexibility to survive and move the public agenda forward. Blair fully grasps the situation as well as the need to apply just enough pressure to the Queen so that she grows and doesn't retreat.  Michael Sheen is super as Tony Blair, using intelligent charm and strategic wit to move the queen to recognition of the gravity of the issues and to take action by showing empathy with the grief of the English people. James Cromwell is excellent as Prince Phillip, sometimes playing the role of the Queen's alter-ego or id with his displays of disgust and indignation. At other times he reveals the isolated and insulated existence of the Windsors that separated them from normal existence. I would recommend this film to be viewed and analyzed in a class on adaptive leadership.",5,Flexibility and Leadership,1202515200,"02 9, 2008",2008,1706,"['excellent', 'highly', 'entertaining', 'film', 'smartly', 'written', 'script', 'humorous', 'never', 'lags', 'excellent', 'sequencing', 'editing', 'keep', 'viewer', 'fully', 'engaged', 'exceptional', 'acting', 'Helen', 'Mirren', 'James', 'Cromwell', 'Michael', 'Sheen', 'underlying', 'theme', 'adaptive', 'leadership', 'superbly', 'seamlessly', 'integrated', 'narrative', 'theme', 'adaptive', 'leadership', 'exhibited', 'first', 'Tony', 'Blair', 'later', 'Queen', 'Elisabeth', 'would', 'like', 'comment.Everyone', 'story', 'here', 'tragic', 'death', 'Princess', 'Diana', 'outpouring', 'public', 'grief', 'failure', 'reaction', 'part', 'Windsors', 'What', 'not', 'as', 'well', 'known', 'story', 'action', 'where', 'Tony', 'Blair', 'new', 'Prime', 'Minister', 'was', 'able', 'gradually', 'move', 'Queen', 'Elisabeth', 'comprehend', 'public', 'mood', 'respond', 'mood', 'appropriately', 'characters', 'display', 'adaptive', 'leadership', 'necessary', 'flexibility', 'survive', 'move', 'public', 'agenda', 'forward', 'Blair', 'fully', 'situation', 'as', 'well', 'need', 'apply', 'just', 'enough', 'pressure', 'Queen', ""n't"", 'retreat', 'Michael', 'Sheen', 'super', 'Tony', 'Blair', 'using', 'intelligent', 'charm', 'strategic', 'wit', 'move', 'queen', 'recognition', 'gravity', 'issues', 'take', 'action', 'showing', 'empathy', 'grief', 'English', 'people', 'James', 'Cromwell', 'excellent', 'Prince', 'Phillip', 'sometimes', 'playing', 'role', 'Queen', 'alter-ego', 'id', 'displays', 'disgust', 'indignation', 'other', 'times', 'isolated', 'insulated', 'existence', 'Windsors', 'separated', 'normal', 'existence', 'would', 'recommend', 'film', 'be', 'viewed', 'analyzed', 'class', 'adaptive', 'leadership']",The Queen

647517,A2PBV1899CX3TE,B00005JPAM,"C. CRADDOCK ""Cr@$#!!!!""","[2, 2]","THE QUEEN is first and foremost about Queen Elizabeth II, but it is also about Elizabeth, the person beneath the crown. To show us that person, it focuses on her reaction to the death of Princess Diana in 1997, and the media circus that followed. It was also about the complex relations between the House of Windsor and 10 Downing Street and their roles in the circus, as ringmasters, barkers, clowns, tight rope walkers, marks, and shills.Though Lady Di looms large in this legend, she is seen only in documentary footage, in interviews, public appearances, and paparazzi shots. No actress even attempts to play her, but it speaks to the authenticity of Helen Mirren's Oscar winning performance that the real life footage blends in seamlessly when ever she is on screen. Mirren was totally believable as Her Royal Majesty. All the little details were correct, even down to how the Royal Corgis obeyed her. A pack of dogs comes tearing through the room, then, with a single command from Her Royal Majesty; they all turn on a dime simultaneously. She had that authority in her voice, that certainty that her orders would be carried out.The second most important character in this story was newly elected Prime Minister, Tony Blair. Michael Sheen played him quite well, capturing his vibration, aided by an uncanny physical resemblance. He might have overdone the bright eyes--like a portrait of a Prime Minister as painted by Keene--but the slight exaggeration didn't spoil the over all effect. Besides achieving peace in Ireland, his role in stage managing Princess Diana's funeral may have been his finest hour. His popularity certainly soared after he declared Diana ""The People's Princess.""The film shows us the complex relationship between Blair and The Queen, and both their spouses have much smaller roles, but provide little flashes of insight into the characters of the two principles. James Cromwell gives a strong performance as Prince Phillip, and was totally believable as he climbed into the royal bedchamber, saying ""move over, cabbage."" So much for royal protocol. Tony Blair's wife was skeptical of the whole concept of monarchy, so she was a good foil, kind of a devil's advocate, if you will, for Tony Blair to express his growing admiration for the Queen, and the institution of the monarchy.Alex Jennings played Prince Charles, and though he was not nearly ugly enough--not saddled with the features of a horse--nevertheless, gave a good performance, almost making you feel sympathy for him. Missing in Action were William and Harry, the heir and the spare. They are rarely seen, and then only glimpsed, but this was a very tasteful choice by director Stephen Frears, and script writer Peter Morgan. Just one of many choices that make for a wonderful, well rounded film experience.Finally, I must mention the magnificent stag, in a cameo performance, who may be only a symbol, but a potent one, and one who illuminates just how the Queen always tries to keep a stiff upper lip, no matter what emotions are storming below.",4,Mirren Reigns Supreme,1179532800,"05 19, 2007",2007,3041,"['QUEEN', 'first', 'foremost', 'Queen', 'Elizabeth', 'II', 'also', 'about', 'Elizabeth', 'person', 'crown', 'show', 'person', 'reaction', 'death', 'Princess', 'Diana', '1997', 'media', 'circus', 'followed', 'was', 'also', 'complex', 'relations', 'House', 'Windsor', '10', 'Downing', 'Street', 'roles', 'circus', 'ringmasters', 'barkers', 'clowns', 'tight', 'rope', 'walkers', 'marks', 'shills.Though', 'Lady', 'Di', 'large', 'legend', 'seen', 'only', 'documentary', 'footage', 'interviews', 'public', 'appearances', 'paparazzi', 'shots', 'actress', 'even', 'attempts', 'play', 'authenticity', 'Helen', 'Mirren', 'Oscar', 'winning', 'performance', 'real', 'life', 'footage', 'seamlessly', 'when', 'ever', 'screen', 'Mirren', 'was', 'totally', 'believable', 'Royal', 'Majesty', 'little', 'details', 'were', 'correct', 'even', 'down', 'how', 'Royal', 'Corgis', 'obeyed', 'pack', 'dogs', 'tearing', 'room', 'then', 'single', 'command', 'Royal', 'Majesty', 'turn', 'dime', 'simultaneously', 'had', 'authority', 'voice', 'orders', 'would', 'be', 'carried', 'out.The', 'second', 'most', 'important', 'character', 'story', 'was', 'newly', 'elected', 'Prime', 'Minister', 'Tony', 'Blair', 'Michael', 'Sheen', 'played', 'quite', 'well', 'capturing', 'vibration', 'aided', 'uncanny', 'physical', 'resemblance', 'might', 'have', 'overdone', 'bright', 'eyes', 'portrait', 'Prime', 'Minister', 'painted', 'Keene', 'slight', 'exaggeration', 'did', ""n't"", 'spoil', 'effect', 'achieving', 'peace', 'Ireland', 'role', 'stage', 'managing', 'Princess', 'Diana', 'funeral', 'may', 'have', 'been', 'finest', 'hour', 'popularity', 'certainly', 'soared', 'declared', 'Diana', 'People', 'Princess', 'film', 'complex', 'relationship', 'Blair', 'Queen', 'spouses', 'have', 'much', 'smaller', 'roles', 'provide', 'little', 'flashes', 'insight', 'characters', 'two', 'principles', 'James', 'Cromwell', 'strong', 'performance', 'Prince', 'Phillip', 'was', 'totally', 'believable', 'climbed', 'royal', 'bedchamber', 'saying', 'move', 'cabbage', 'So', 'much', 'royal', 'protocol', 'Tony', 'Blair', 'wife', 'was', 'skeptical', 'whole', 'concept', 'monarchy', 'was', 'good', 'foil', 'kind', 'devil', 'advocate', 'will', 'Tony', 'Blair', 'express', 'growing', 'admiration', 'Queen', 'institution', 'monarchy.Alex', 'Jennings', 'played', 'Prince', 'Charles', 'was', 'not', 'nearly', 'ugly', 'enough', 'not', 'saddled', 'features', 'horse', 'nevertheless', 'gave', 'good', 'performance', 'almost', 'making', 'feel', 'sympathy', 'Missing', 'Action', 'were', 'William', 'Harry', 'heir', 'spare', 'are', 'rarely', 'seen', 'then', 'only', 'glimpsed', 'was', 'very', 'tasteful', 'choice', 'director', 'Stephen', 'Frears', 'script', 'writer', 'Peter', 'Morgan', 'Just', 'one', 'many', 'choices', 'make', 'wonderful', 'well', 'rounded', 'film', 'experience.Finally', 'must', 'mention', 'magnificent', 'stag', 'cameo', 'performance', 'who', 'may', 'be', 'only', 'symbol', 'potent', 'one', 'one', 'who', 'just', 'how', 'Queen', 'always', 'keep', 'stiff', 'upper', 'lip', 'matter', 'what', 'emotions', 'are', 'storming']",The Queen

647521,A1B4NBFZJY2FIZ,B00005JPAM,Chris Fung,"[6, 8]","This is a great peice of movie making.  For one thing, the tensions and dramatic moments in this film all occur  between two people talking quietly to one another in relatively small rooms.  Getting that right not only requires superb actors but also camera work that is, like a good butler, both intimate and discreet.Obviously this is Helen Mirren's movie and she shines in a way that encapsulates much of what made many of us rabid fans of her performances as Jane Tennison on the Prime Suspect television series.  Michael Sheen has some good moments as Tony Blair, and his (fictional) defense of the Queen is both moving and ironic given the way the real Tony has all but tripped over himself being George W. Bush's footstool.Director Steven Frears and his DP Affonso Beata, deserve huge credit for the emotional intensity and maturity of this film.  The leads are given plenty of room to do their stuff and they do, but the depth of this movie also relies on the stellar supporting cast.For my money, some of the best performances in the whole movie come from Roger Allam as Her Majesty (HM)'s private secretary Robin Javrin - the real Javrin apparently was a bit miffed at Allam's girth -it being somewhat more substantial than his own), Alex Jennings who plays  a surprisingly sympathetic Prince Charles, and of course Helen McCrory who makes the most of  a rather melodramatically rendered Cherrie Blair (shown as a rather shrill anti-monarchist, which unsurprisingly, did not go over well at Number 10).To understand the true perceptiveness of this movie in a British context, one has to understand the role of the monarchy in contemporary British society. Despite her aloofness from the public eye, the real Queen (and even more so, the late Queen Mother) were and are figures of great familiarity to the British public.  HM's very deliberate fashion sense and demeanor, while indicative of her own personality, were also essential in completing the transformation of the British monarchy from a 19th century aristocratic family a generation removed from politically-engaged monarchy, to an institution that wields no formal power but which is nonetheless, one of  the emotional lynch pins of modern, middle-class British sensibility.In contrast to Diana who became a celebrity in full People magazine mode, the Queen presents herself as a symbol of ordinary British middle-class sobriety and restraint.  Whilst much has rightly been made of the mantra ""duty first, self second"", a second and perhaps more important issue in understanding the tension between Diana and ""The Firm"" is the way in which Diana's ""antics"" were seen as a direct challenge to the public image of the older royals as a well-pedigreed but essentially decent and normal version of the good neighbors down the street.  This transformation lies at the heart of the British monarchy's ability to survive two world wars,  the end of the empire, the plummetting cultural prestige of the rest of the aristos, the rise and fall of the welfare state and finally: the triumph of cultural Thatcherism with its petit bourgeois envy and suspicion of anything collective.On an emotional level, middle-aged Brits tend to view HM as a woman who you could (with the right dress on) feel comfortable borrowing a cup of sugar from.  This leaving aside the actual wealth of the monarchy as an institution, a fact which continues to astound Americans who have a much more prosaic notion of figures of public interest - although I think one partial analogy who has achieved a similar level of emotional familiarity and trust for folks in the United States is Oprah Winfrey.In the same way that Oprah transcends her racial identity for her white audiences, the Queen (but interestingly, not her husband, nor to some extent her son Charles) has transcended her class position as the uber-aristocrat in a Britain where class is still vitally important (if somewhat muted by comparison with the 1930s).  At the risk of generalizing, I would say that a majority of Brits still feel a sense of personal loyalty to  the Queen herself (and hence the monarchy), while not necessarily supporting the class system, nor the political goals of the establishment.To the Queen, Diana then represented the culmination of a ""loss of face"" brought on by the younger royals (and Princess Anne's) public disgraces (primarily divorces) captured on the front pages of the loathsome tabloid press.  Whether or not she was the people's princess, she was certainly seen as garish, attention-seeking and vulgar by the Royal establishment.  Paradoxically perhaps, the very same solid citizens who relished the normality of the Queen, also devoured the fairy-tale glamor provided by Diana.  Royalty both serves and entertains, and in the age of reality TV, Diana was for better or worse, the icon for celebrity-royalty.HM's inability to engage with the changing face of Britain (generationally, racially and in terms of it's attachments to the outward symbols of class identity),  probably did blind her to the extent to which Diana of all the younger royals actually achieved the level of perceived personal intimacy that the Queen herself enjoyed.  I would hazard a guess that much of the public grief that was displayed at Diana's death was not over the death of Diana herself, but was an expression of mourning for personal tragedies.  Diana was a symbol for people's aspirations, and she was a person who continued to feed a sense of communal identity albeit through the glamor of celebrity despite her divorce.  In that sense, she was indeed ""the people's princess"".Director Frears deserves huge credit for capturing this tension without ever needing to bring the two women into contact with one another.  Mirren's Elizabeth reacts to televised images of Diana but we see the baffled annoyance she must have provoked in real life.  This is not a documentary, it is a work of fiction that seeks to highlight particular ideas and characters.  We will probably never know what HM thinks of the movie, but thanks to Frears and writer Peter Morgan have given us an intelligent, engaging and thought-provoking window into the human condition and into the possible mindset of a person who could be the longest-reigning constitutional monarch in a democracy since Queen Victoria.",5,A dramatic tour-de-force,1172534400,"02 27,

647522,A18G7GG53G2X8A,B00005JPAM,Chris Pandolfi,"[2, 2]","What's interesting about ""The Queen"" is that it gives insight into the life of a public figure that's actually quite private: Queen Elizabeth II. I obviously have no way of understanding the responsibilities associated with ruling a country, but--at the risk of stating the obvious--I can imagine that it isn't easy. Every decision, action, and idea that's made will meet with praise and/or criticism on a global scale. Options must be weighed for the benefit of her people, not for the benefit of herself or her family. She must be willing to be scrutinized and ridiculed by the media, who legally have the right to attack her character, disagree with her policies, and mock her in general. These issues are skillfully examined in this film. However, I'm hard pressed to say that it's an accurate examination. Likewise, some viewers may be turned off by its consistently dry tone.Nonetheless, there's a lot about this film to enjoy, not the least of which is Helen Mirren's portrayal of the Queen; here's a woman that was raised to believe that the needs of her country outweigh her own needs. While she's diligent and professional when it comes to governmental affairs, her emotions are kept under lock and key. This proved to be troublesome in August of 1997, when Diana, Princess of Wales, died in Paris in an automobile accident. The Queen's immediate reaction is deciding to keep the Royal Family out of the public eye. Part of this decision had to do with Diana's children, who needed to grieve without the press hassling them. The rest had to do with the Queen's disapproval of Diana; she saw her as nothing more than a publicity hound. Furthermore, Diana was technically no longer a member of the Royal Family (she divorced Prince Charles a year earlier). Because of that, it seemed proper to respect the wishes of the Spencer family to have a private funeral.This does not sit well with the British population, who generally loved Diana for her humanitarianism. Public opinion soon turns against the Queen. At the same time, the popularity ratings for the newly elected Prime Minister, Tony Blair (Michael Sheen), are rising; he's been much more public about Diana's tragic death. A majority of the film focuses on his working relationship with the Queen, specifically in trying to get her to cooperate and listen to her people. They want her to make a statement. They want her to raise the flag over Buckingham Palace at half-mast. They want her to acknowledge the throngs of Diana supporters that are leaving bouquets at the Palace gates. She refuses to take part in the media frenzy. In her mind, Diana's death is a private matter; the public will simply have to accept that.It's soon decided that Diana's funeral will, in fact, be a public affair. True, the Queen finds this highly improper. However, she also begins to understand the British people will not let this one go; they want Diana to have a proper funeral, and the want their Queen to show some degree of compassion. The pressure they put on her is increasing, so much so that long buried emotions begin to resurface. Example: while walking through a remote countryside, she cries for the first time. It's obvious that years of royal etiquette have had an impact; despite the fact that she's alone and surrounded by acres of open land, her sobs are forcefully restrained. In that moment, her only comfort is a wild buck that passes by; it's large, majestic, and clearly symbolic of strength and fortitude.At that point, she finally begins taking Blair's advice, much to the chagrin of her husband, Philip (James Cromwell), and her mother (Sylvia Sims). She publicly walks past the piles of bouquets, reading notes written by Diana supporters (one says, ""Your blood is on their hands""). She makes a televised statement (albeit a prewritten, mechanical, emotionless one). It all leads up to Diana's funeral, a full media blowout with celebrity attendance, including Luciano Pavarotti, Steven Spielberg, Tom Hanks, and Elton John (who would score a hit with the new version of ""Candle in the Wind""). By the time the funeral ends, the Queen's relationship with Prime Minister Blair has diminished considerably. Their final scene acts as a counterpart to their first, in which they meet: the latter is a light, pleasant moment between the two; the former is tense and reserved.Some might think that the purpose of ""The Queen"" is to portray Elizabeth II as a cold, uncaring, conservative individual. Indeed, her engrained devotion to duty and honor doesn't make her especially gregarious. However, I don't think the filmmakers were attempting to portray her in any particular fashion, nor do I think they were passing judgment on her; instead, they were presenting her plainly and directly, allowing the audience to come to their own conclusions. Maybe it's best that we do no such thing; very few can appreciate the responsibilities and sacrifices required of a ruler.",4,Royalty to One's Country,1172275200,"02 24, 2007",2007,4938,"['What', 'interesting', 'Queen', 'insight', 'life', 'public', 'figure', 'actually', 'quite', 'private', 'Queen', 'Elizabeth', 'II', 'obviously', 'have', 'way', 'understanding', 'responsibilities', 'associated', 'ruling', 'country', 'risk', 'stating', 'obvious', 'can', 'imagine', ""n't"", 'easy', 'decision', 'action', 'idea', 'made', 'will', 'meet', 'praise', 'and/or', 'criticism', 'global', 'scale', 'Options', 'must', 'be', 'weighed', 'benefit', 'people', 'not', 'benefit', 'herself', 'family', 'must', 'be', 'willing', 'be', 'scrutinized', 'ridiculed', 'media', 'who', 'legally', 'have', 'right', 'attack', 'character', 'disagree', 'policies', 'mock', 'general', 'issues', 'are', 'skillfully', 'examined', 'film', 'However', ""'m"", 'hard', 'pressed', 'say', 'accurate', 'examination', 'Likewise', 'viewers', 'may', 'be', 'turned', 'off', 'consistently', 'dry', 'tone.Nonetheless', 'lot', 'film', 'enjoy', 'not', 'least', 'Helen', 'Mirren', 'portrayal', 'Queen', 'here', 'woman', 'was', 'raised', 'believe', 'needs', 'country', 'outweigh', 'own', 'needs', 'diligent', 'professional', 'when', 'governmental', 'affairs', 'emotions', 'are', 'kept', 'lock', 'key', 'proved', 'be', 'troublesome', 'August', '1997', 'when', 'Diana', 'Princess', 'Wales', 'died', 'Paris', 'automobile', 'accident', 'Queen', 'immediate', 'reaction', 'deciding', 'keep', 'Royal', 'Family', 'public', 'eye', 'Part', 'decision', 'had', 'do', 'Diana', 'children', 'who', 'needed', 'grieve', 'press', 'hassling', 'rest', 'had', 'do', 'Queen', 'disapproval', 'Diana', 'saw', 'nothing', 'more', 'publicity', 'hound', 'Furthermore', 'Diana', 'was', 'technically', 'no', 'longer', 'member', 'Royal', 'Family', 'divorced', 'Prince', 'Charles', 'year', 'earlier', 'seemed', 'proper', 'respect', 'wishes', 'Spencer', 'family', 'have', 'private', 'funeral.This', 'not', 'sit', 'well', 'British', 'population', 'who', 'generally', 'loved', 'Diana', 'humanitarianism', 'Public', 'opinion', 'soon', 'Queen', 'same', 'time', 'popularity', 'ratings', 'newly', 'elected', 'Prime', 'Minister', 'Tony', 'Blair', 'Michael', 'Sheen', 'are', 'rising', 'been', 'much', 'more', 'public', 'Diana', 'tragic', 'death', 'majority', 'film', 'working', 'relationship', 'Queen', 'specifically', 'trying', 'get', 'cooperate', 'listen', 'people', 'want', 'make', 'statement', 'want', 'raise', 'flag', 'Buckingham', 'Palace', 'half-mast', 'want', 'acknowledge', 'throngs', 'Diana', 'supporters', 'are', 'leaving', 'bouquets', 'Palace', 'gates', 'take', 'part', 'media', 'frenzy', 'mind', 'Diana', 'death', 'private', 'matter', 'public', 'will', 'simply', 'have', 'accept', 'that.It', 'soon', 'decided', 'Diana', 'funeral', 'will', 'fact', 'be', 'public', 'affair', 'True', 'Queen', 'highly', 'improper', 'However', 'also', 'understand', 'British', 'people', 'will', 'not', 'let', 'one', 'go', 'want', 'Diana', 'have', 'proper', 'funeral', 'want', 'Queen', 'show', 'degree', 'compassion', 'pressure', 'put', 'increasing', 'so', 'much', 'long', 'buried', 'emotions', 'begin', 'resurface', 'Example', 'walking', 'remote', 'countryside', 'first', 'time', 'obvious', 'years', 'royal', 'etiquette', 'have', 'had', 'impact', 'fact', 'alone', 'surrounded', 'acres', 'open', 'land', 'sobs', 'are', 'forcefully', 'restrained', 'moment', 'only', 'comfort', 'wild', 'buck', 'large', 'majestic', 'clearly', 'symbolic', 'strength', 'fortitude.At', 'point', 'finally', 'taking', 'Blair', 'advice', 'much', 'chagrin', 'husband', 'Philip', 'James', 'Cromwell', 'mother', 'Sylvia', 'Sims', 'publicly', 'piles', 'bouquets', 'reading', 'notes', 'written', 'Diana', 'supporters', 'one', 'blood', 'hands', 'televised', 'statement', 'prewritten', 'mechanical', 'emotionless', 'one', 'up', 'Diana', 'funeral', 'full', 'media', 'celebrity', 'attendance', 'including', 'Luciano', 'Pavarotti', 'Steven', 'Spielberg', 'Tom', 'Hanks', 'Elton', 'John', 'who', 'would', 'score', 'hit', 'new', 'version', 'Candle', 'Wind', 'time', 'funeral', 'ends', 'Queen', 'relationship', 'Prime', 'Minister', 'Blair', 'diminished', 'considerably', 'final', 'scene', 'acts', 'counterpart', 'first', 'meet', 'latter', 'light', 'pleasant', 'moment', 'two', 'former', 'tense', 'reserved.Some', 'might', 'think', 'purpose', 'Queen', 'portray', 'Elizabeth', 'II', 'cold', 'uncaring', 'conservative', 'individual', 'Indeed', 'engrained', 'devotion', 'duty', 'honor', ""n't"", 'make', 'especially', 'gregarious', 'However', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'filmmakers', 'were', 'attempting', 'portray', 'particular', 'fashion', 'do', 'think', 'were', 'passing', 'judgment', 'instead', 'were', 'presenting', 'plainly', 'directly', 'allowing', 'audience', 'come', 'own', 'conclusions', 'Maybe', 'best', 'do', 'such', 'thing', 'very', 'few', 'can', 'appreciate', 'responsibilities', 'sacrifices', 'required', 'ruler']",The Queen

Here are my thoughts while watching ""The Queen"":-This is great.  I'm going to learn a lot about The Queen of Europe watching this movie.-What's she doing?  Walking from one room into another?  Well, I guess Queens do have to do that.-I can't believe that The King of Queens has been on TV for so many years.  But Kevin James is very, very funny.-You know what was a good movie?  Hitch.  I think Will Smith and Kevin James should do another movie where they have to travel across the country in a car and maybe one of them is a cop and the other is a bad guy.  That would be hilarious.-Oh, the Queen is taking her dogs out.  Right.  I'm so sure she doesn't have people that do that for her.-Hey, how come there's nothing about the King?  No offense to women, but isn't the King more powerful than the Queen?  I mean, I have played Rummy before.-Juice Newton should have done the soundtrack to this movie.-Oh my God the Queen still isn't doing anything in this movie except talking and thinking.  No wonder people didn't vote for her for a second term!-I liked that woman who played The Queen in ""Naked Gun.""  She was hilarious and it taught me that Queens have a human side, which this movie is not doing.-Tony Blair is a good actor.-I think the King is being played by the guy from ""Babe""!  He should say, ""that'll do, Queen.  That'll do.""  That would be awesome.  Wait a minute, did he just say something cool?  Oh, no.  My mistake.-I've got to see ""The Great Muppet Caper"" again.  I spend too much time focusing on the first movie and when they took over Manhattan.  I wish I was alive when muppets took over Manhattan, because that must have dominated the news.-I've got to go get a snack.-Alright.  Twizzlers and cherry coke.  Sweet!  If I bite off the end of this Twizzler, I can totally have an edible straw.  What did I miss?  The Queen is making a speech?  Terrific.  That's new and exciting.  I'll have to remember to go back and watch that part when I rent the DVD in the month of Nevertember.-Thank God for the closing credits.  I wonder where I parked.

647525,A32BHDDDOLQUR8,B00005JPAM,CJ,"[8, 28]","As with my Sin City movie review, I know that I am going to get crushed by my one star rating, especially with all the awards and press this movie has gotten, but here goes, my opposition review.Basically, the whole flow of this movie feels like a bad TV soap opera drama, where pretty much nothing happens except people talking on their phone in their studies.  The whole sweep of the film is very, very clunky.  A lot of the sets feel very, very staged and cheap.  Seriously, there are a lot of British television shows that are a lot smoother, and less slow in pace.As far as plot, you take an historical event that was extremely tabloid to begin with, and then try to fit it into the pace and style of a quiet British drama, and apparently the clash of cultures is supposed to make it look interesting.  It fails to clash in this regard, it looks like two separate movies.As far as acting is concerned, Helen Mirren has done a better and more dynamic job in other films.  Yeah, this is not designed to be a dynamic role anyways, the Queen of England.  My opinion is this - it really doesn't take a lot of effort to display stoicism and lack of emotion across an entire movie.  The rest of the cast is really iffy as well- even James Cromwell.  And what's up with Tony Blair's  lips?  Too much makeup?The sad thing is that I am the type of reviewer that generally likes this sort of film - I tend to steer away from heavy action and adventure and prefer drama.  I also would like to say that I don't really have a strong opinion on the British constitutional monarchy either, though this movie's plot is so lacking it never really gets to the deeper issues.Go watch a nice British mystery drama instead.",1,Yawn...,1187049600,"08 14, 2007",2007,1706,"['Sin', 'City', 'movie', 'review', 'know', 'am', 'going', 'get', 'crushed', 'one', 'star', 'rating', 'especially', 'awards', 'press', 'movie', 'gotten', 'here', 'opposition', 'review.Basically', 'whole', 'flow', 'movie', 'bad', 'TV', 'soap', 'opera', 'drama', 'where', 'pretty', 'much', 'nothing', 'people', 'talking', 'phone', 'studies', 'whole', 'sweep', 'film', 'very', 'very', 'clunky', 'lot', 'sets', 'feel', 'very', 'very', 'staged', 'cheap', 'Seriously', 'are', 'lot', 'British', 'television', 'shows', 'are', 'lot', 'smoother', 'less', 'slow', 'pace.As', 'far', 'plot', 'take', 'historical', 'event', 'was', 'extremely', 'tabloid', 'begin', 'then', 'try', 'fit', 'pace', 'style', 'quiet', 'British', 'drama', 'apparently', 'clash', 'cultures', 'supposed', 'make', 'look', 'interesting', 'clash', 'regard', 'two', 'separate', 'movies.As', 'far', 'acting', 'concerned', 'Helen', 'Mirren', 'done', 'better', 'more', 'dynamic', 'job', 'other', 'films', 'Yeah', 'not', 'designed', 'be', 'dynamic', 'role', 'anyways', 'Queen', 'England', 'opinion', 'really', ""n't"", 'take', 'lot', 'effort', 'display', 'stoicism', 'lack', 'emotion', 'entire', 'movie', 'rest', 'cast', 'really', 'iffy', 'well-', 'even', 'James', 'Cromwell', 'what', 'up', 'Tony', 'Blair', 'lips', 'Too', 'much', 'makeup', 'sad', 'thing', 'am', 'type', 'reviewer', 'generally', 'sort', 'film', 'tend', 'steer', 'away', 'heavy', 'action', 'adventure', 'prefer', 'drama', 'also', 'would', 'like', 'say', 'do', ""n't"", 'really', 'have', 'strong', 'opinion', 'British', 'constitutional', 'monarchy', 'movie', 'plot', 'so', 'lacking', 'never', 'really', 'deeper', 'issues.Go', 'watch', 'nice', 'British', 'mystery', 'drama', 'instead']",The Queen

To issue an immediate statement after Princess Diana's death would be irresponsible, an act more suited for a populist cum politician. To be able to stick to her principles (even as it may be out-dated), reflect upon the escalating crisis and do the only thing (not necessarliy the right thing) left to do for the monarchy makes Queen Elizabeth II a truly outstanding soverign. Such is the wonderful script which makes the movie  thought-provoking, warm and intriguing.Helen Mirren is brilliant in her portrayal of the Queen. I especially like her subtlety, her ""stubborness"" without offending anyone. Instead, she has my complete sympathy. The movie is shot in such a beautiful countryside and full of metaphor. The Queen love the dogs, the deer and may very well be more at ease displaying her emotions toward the animals than towards people.

647527,A1AISPOIIHTHXX,B00005JPAM,"Cloud ""...""","[4, 4]","Sometimes it's hard to watch a movie that receives large amounts of praise. You always feel like your less-than-enthusiastic view of the film will have people proclaiming that you ""didn't get it and missed the point"". In the case of the Queen, I felt like it centered on an intriguing time, it had excellent performances yet at the same time, I felt it did have some issues that kept bugging me and while I will recommend the film, it just has too many aspects to it that dragged it down.It's the end of August 1997 and new Prime Minister Tony Blair, a kind of modernizer who wants to change some of Britain's established rules, is a kind of fish out of water when it comes to etiquette around Queen Elizabeth II. However tragedy strikes when Diana, Princess of Wales, is killed in a car crash in Paris. The country and the world mourns while the Royal Family remains in their palace without so much as public appearances or issuing statements, preferring to keep it a private matter and not sensationalizing it. The British tabloids have other ideas as they deem it insensitive and stoic so Blair tries to convince the Queen to at least do something in the public before they decide the monarchy is unneeded.After watching the Queen, 2 things struck me: 1) the huge scrutiny that happens in the British Press and their brutal stories that make the paper and 2) everyone acted really well but the film just didn't sit well with me. Helen Mirren is of course fabulous as the Queen and balances that line between going over-the-top primadonna and unemotional mannequin. When she finally breaks down, she's facing away from the camera as if to say even we aren't allowed to see even an actress playing the Queen cry on-screen. Another highlight was Michael Sheen, playing Tony Blair, who infuses him with a kind of real-world sensability since he's obviously clueless about mannerisms around royalty. Of course the big question is did he really want the Queen to look more favorably to the public or use it as a kind of publicity factory. Who knows. The only one I felt didn't click with me was Prince Charles, Diana's ex. He almost feels opportunistic, like he tries to make things look better in his favor. Maybe it was just me.The other flaw I felt it had was a sense of a pacing and repetitive tone. Of course it's a character study but in films, there's usually things characters do to bide time and make the scenes feel intriguing. Here, characters just...talk, and not the kind of meaningful talk it should've had. And after awhile you start to notice characters kind of repeat themselves too much in scenes. The Queen tries her hardest to be sympathetic without giving in to changing values, Blair is concerned at the lack of statements from the monarch while Queen's husband expresses non-supportive news in regards to Diana, her attention and what the public wants. After awhile it feels what a friend calls egg-like: whether it's sunny-side up or scrambled or over-easy, it's still egg in the end. Weird analogy I know.So is it worth a watch? Well many people will enjoy it but for me, I felt it was a well-made but kind of flawed film.

647528,A3OEECMCM2T4KQ,B00005JPAM,C. Middleton,"[1, 1]","This is certainly a magnificent performance from Helen Mirren as Queen Elizabeth II. In fact the entire cast, particularly Michael Sheen as Prime Minister, Tony Blair and James Cromwell as Prince Phillip, all did fine performances. Great credit must go to the director, Stephan Frears, as has been mentioned, each well performed scene follow seamlessly and the story itself, screen writer, Peter Morgan managed to capture the feelings of the world at the death of Princess Diana and the apparent lack of compassion from the house of Windsor, specifically Queen Elizabeth.The film also approaches the debated issue whether the Monarchy is an out-dated institution, a thousand year line of monarchs that have ruled Britain and made this little island in the Atlantic, an empire not seen since the height of the Roman Empire. However times change, and since the French Revolution, the concept of Monarchy has been shown to be, at the least, superfluous, not paying tax and living off the people. The Nobility not paying tax was in fact one of the contributing factors in the creation of the French Revolution. If you talk to a social conscious Brit, they are either opposed to the institution and would like to see England become a republic or are true monarchists, conservative and wanting to see the customs and age old traditions continue because they contain values that are relevant even in our so-called modern times. This issue is tastefully explored and leans towards the institution remaining and adapting in our new millennium.We currently live in a world where our deepest fears and private concerns are broadcasted for all to hear and see. It is now fashionable to `wear our hearts on our sleeves' go on a popular talk shows and spill our guts out. This has not always been the case. In an older generation, a truly English attribute, was to not show emotion, keep a stiff upper lip, and carry through any crises with dignity. Queen Elizabeth the II worked as a mechanic during WW II, and was crowned Queen at a young age, and the first prime minister she had to deal with was Winston Churchill. To show `unnecessary' emotion during a time of loss was simply not done, and doing so, showed weakness. This new fashion to display emotion to the masses was beyond the queen's understanding and anathema to everything she represented. The notions of modernism and tradition and our changing sensibilities are the crux of the film.The film's ending gives the audience a clue as to the direction England is heading in terms of tradition and our modern world.Helen Mirren is absolutely Queen Elizabeth the II...almost scary in her portrayal of the monarch...suspending all disbelief, she had me believing she actually was the monarch...Oscar material in the realist sense.Good film.",4,Modernism vs. Tradition & Princess Diana,1171670400,"02 17, 2007",2007,2784,"['certainly', 'magnificent', 'performance', 'Helen', 'Mirren', 'Queen', 'Elizabeth', 'II', 'fact', 'entire', 'cast', 'particularly', 'Michael', 'Sheen', 'Prime', 'Minister', 'Tony', 'Blair', 'James', 'Cromwell', 'Prince', 'Phillip', 'did', 'fine', 'performances', 'Great', 'credit', 'must', 'go', 'director', 'Stephan', 'Frears', 'been', 'mentioned', 'well', 'performed', 'scene', 'follow', 'seamlessly', 'story', 'screen', 'writer', 'Peter', 'Morgan', 'managed', 'capture', 'feelings', 'world', 'death', 'Princess', 'Diana', 'apparent', 'lack', 'compassion', 'house', 'Windsor', 'specifically', 'Queen', 'Elizabeth.The', 'film', 'also', 'debated', 'issue', 'Monarchy', 'out-dated', 'institution', 'thousand', 'year', 'line', 'monarchs', 'have', 'ruled', 'Britain', 'made', 'little', 'island', 'Atlantic', 'empire', 'not', 'seen', 'height', 'Roman', 'Empire', 'However', 'times', 'change', 'French', 'Revolution', 'concept', 'Monarchy', 'been', 'shown', 'be', 'least', 'superfluous', 'not', 'paying', 'tax', 'living', 'off', 'people', 'Nobility', 'not', 'paying', 'tax', 'was', 'fact', 'one', 'contributing', 'factors', 'creation', 'French', 'Revolution', 'talk', 'social', 'conscious', 'Brit', 'are', 'opposed', 'institution', 'would', 'like', 'see', 'England', 'become', 'republic', 'are', 'true', 'monarchists', 'conservative', 'wanting', 'see', 'customs', 'age', 'old', 'traditions', 'continue', 'contain', 'values', 'are', 'relevant', 'even', 'so-called', 'modern', 'times', 'issue', 'tastefully', 'explored', 'towards', 'institution', 'remaining', 'adapting', 'new', 'millennium.We', 'currently', 'live', 'world', 'where', 'deepest', 'fears', 'private', 'concerns', 'are', 'broadcasted', 'hear', 'see', 'now', 'fashionable', 'wear', 'hearts', 'sleeves', 'go', 'popular', 'talk', 'shows', 'spill', 'guts', 'out', 'not', 'always', 'been', 'case', 'older', 'generation', 'truly', 'English', 'attribute', 'was', 'not', 'show', 'emotion', 'keep', 'stiff', 'upper', 'lip', 'carry', 'crises', 'dignity', 'Queen', 'Elizabeth', 'II', 'worked', 'mechanic', 'WW', 'II', 'was', 'crowned', 'Queen', 'young', 'age', 'first', 'prime', 'minister', 'had', 'deal', 'was', 'Winston', 'Churchill', 'show', 'unnecessary', 'emotion', 'time', 'loss', 'was', 'simply', 'not', 'done', 'doing', 'so', 'showed', 'weakness', 'new', 'fashion', 'display', 'emotion', 'masses', 'was', 'queen', 'understanding', 'anathema', 'everything', 'represented', 'notions', 'modernism', 'tradition', 'changing', 'sensibilities', 'are', 'crux', 'film.The', 'film', 'ending', 'audience', 'clue', 'direction', 'England', 'heading', 'terms', 'tradition', 'modern', 'world.Helen', 'Mirren', 'absolutely', 'Queen', 'Elizabeth', 'II', 'almost', 'scary', 'portrayal', 'monarch', 'suspending', 'disbelief', 'had', 'believing', 'actually', 'was', 'monarch', 'Oscar', 'material', 'realist', 'sense.Good', 'film']",The Queen

The British public (and many elsewhere) go into a genuine spasm of grief. The Queen (Helen Mirren) and the royals completely misread the situation and are determined to keep things private with no undignified displays of emotion. They are such a conventional, mundane family. Plus, of course, they detested Diana. Tony Blair (Michael Sheen), newly in as Prime Minister, reads the situation correctly but has to find a way to bring the Queen to understand the seriousness of how the public is beginning to react to her remoteness. And it's all inside stuff.The Queen is portrayed as absolutely clueless at first, a product of her upbringing, a captive of what she feels ""duty"" is. Emotionally, she is so closed in...so ""English""...that one can realize what a repressed childhood Charles must have had with a bully for a father and a mother unable to express love easily. Philip is not just a bully, he is full of blustering royal certitude. Charles is well-intentioned, more intuitive than you'd think and weak. Blair is irritatingly ingratiating but right. Cherie Blair, his wife, is an anti-monarchist with sharp teeth, an unpleasant piece of work.It's a lot of fun.Stephen Frears has made one of his best films, and that's saying a lot for the director of such off-beat and excellent movies as My Favorite Laundrette, Prick Up Your Ears, Sammy and Rosie Get Laid, The Grifters, High Fidelity and Dirty Pretty Things.What a last few months Helen Mirren has had. She does a wonderful job as Elizabeth II. It's no superficial performance. We're amazed at Elizabeth's inability to grasp the change in how the people want her to behave, then her eventually conceding the point to Blair, and then her ability to carry off what is required. Compare Mirren's job as Elizabeth II with her performance as Elizabeth I in 2005. Then compare her performance (from what I've read of it) as Jane Tennison in the upcoming Prime Suspect 7.

I had enjoyed watching it before but enjoyed it even more the second time. Helen Mirren as Queen Elizabeth and Michael Sheen as Tony Blair were phenomenal. I didn't really care for Alex Jennings as Prince Charles but then again, I don't really care for Prince Charles. Prince Philip was very well played by James Cromwell although portrayed as harsh, cruel, and uncaring.The movie takes place in the weeks after Princess Diana's accidental death in 1997 and intersperses actual news footage throughout. A newly elected Tony Blair immediately gives a speech but the royal family isolate themselves in Balmoral and refuse to acknowledge Diana's death publicly. Queen Elizabeth believes in handling everything privately, Tony Blair, newly elected, tries to pursuade her that the people want more. Prince Charles, played rather sympathetically in this film, also tries to influence the Queen but she does not agree. The press begin to harshly criticize the royal family, the public becomes angry and begin speaking out against the royal family, and Tony Blair continues to plead with the Queen to reconsider and 'be there' for her people.Mirren is fantastic as the dignified yet somewhat vulnerable Queen. The part where the family finally return to England and walk amongst the flowers and notes left outside the castle, many of the notes expressing harsh feelings towards the monarchy, gave me chills and brought tears to my eyes. As well, the included footage of Diana's brother's actual speech was incredibly emotional. The Queen finally speaks publicly but I am very curious as to how close this speech is to the real one and plan to google it as soon as I finish this review.""The Queen"" is an extremely well-done, gripping, emotional and thought-provoking film. Blair once again is portrayed very positively but one wonders what really transpired during those weeks since many of the conversations between Blair and the Queen would have been private. It's also interesting to note that no real footage of the royal family where they can be seen is included.To me, a sign of a good movie is when you are left wanting to know more about the events depicted in it.

647537,AUHG8KSHI529U,B00005JPAM,Craig Matteson,"[4, 4]","This really is a very good movie and I think Helen Mirren is wonderful in this performance.  Frankly, I prefer her portrayal of this Elizabeth to her fine performance of the first Elizabeth.  Of course, this is a more personal and private story and it is the intimacy without all the accoutrements of history that I enjoyed so much.I suppose it helps to have at least a passing understanding of the British system of government, its society, and the function of the Queen and the Royal Family.  If you are a thoroughgoing Republican (in their sense - that is anti-monarchist) you probably cannot work up much interest or sympathy for the Queen and much of what the movie offers will simply not be available to you.  So, I hope you can see her as a woman, a real person, who is in this position in her government and in history.  Notice how she came to the throne as a very young woman (only talked about, but not shown in the movie - but can be found on the BBC website).The story centers around the events of the coming to power of Tony Blair (Michael Sheen) as Prime Minster and the death of Princess Diana.  The Queen, being raised during more austere times, particularly the furnace of the Second World War, did not believe in public displays of emotion or grieving.  Add to that the fact the Diana was really no longer a member of the Royal Family when she died.  It was felt that her death was a private affair.  The Queen and her family are steeped in tradition and were following its protocols perfectly.  They in no way were intending to minimize or insult Diana's memory.  Prince Philip (James Cromwell) is quite supportive of tradition and the Queen, but seems quite oblivious to the world outside the grounds of Balmoral or the other palaces.What they did not appreciate was the way the public had taken Diana to its collective heart.  She was a celebrity even more than royalty and the public felt a loss that required the Queen to participate in a new way.  According to the movie, it was Tony Blair, with some help by Prince Charles (Alex Jennings), who played the key role in helping them understand this new requirement.  It was actually a new and heavier burden the public placed on the Royal Family, but the public did not and does not care.I especially liked the way Tony Blair grows in appreciation for Elizabeth and the way she fulfills her role.  The pressures of being Prime Minister almost certainly contributed to that appreciation.  A key scene is when his staff is bashing the Queen yet again and Blair has had enough and sets them straight about the appreciation they should have for her.The most touching scenes are when the Queen is driving her Land Rover around her estate wearing her royal scarf over her hair and being as close to a normal person as she can ever be.  Fascinating.  Another touching scene is her appearance outside the gate viewing the huge displays of flowers and notes the public left for Diana outside Buckingham Palace.  The Queen maintains her public dignity as she reads some very insulting remarks about her and her family, but we know how much this wounds her.The filmmakers have woven actual footage of the actual events into the movie itself and it is amazingly well done and does add to the sense of immediacy of the story.  Anyone who remembers the actual events will still be drawn in by the movie's Tony Blair talking within footage that is matched carefully to the surrounding actual footage contemporary to Diana's death.A very good movie and wonderfully worth seeing.",5,"A very fine film of events most of us remember, but what happened behind the public scenes",1178409600,"05 6, 2007",2007,3534,"['really', 'very', 'good', 'movie', 'think', 'Helen', 'Mirren', 'wonderful', 'performance', 'Frankly', 'prefer', 'portrayal', 'Elizabeth', 'fine', 'performance', 'first', 'Elizabeth', 'course', 'more', 'personal', 'private', 'story', 'intimacy', 'accoutrements', 'history', 'enjoyed', 'so', 'much.I', 'suppose', 'have', 'least', 'passing', 'understanding', 'British', 'system', 'government', 'society', 'function', 'Queen', 'Royal', 'Family', 'are', 'thoroughgoing', 'Republican', 'sense', 'anti-monarchist', 'probably', 'can', 'not', 'work', 'up', 'much', 'interest', 'sympathy', 'Queen', 'much', 'what', 'movie', 'offers', 'will', 'simply', 'not', 'be', 'available', 'So', 'hope', 'can', 'see', 'woman', 'real', 'person', 'who', 'position', 'government', 'history', 'Notice', 'how', 'came', 'throne', 'very', 'young', 'woman', 'only', 'talked', 'not', 'shown', 'movie', 'can', 'be', 'found', 'BBC', 'website', 'story', 'centers', 'events', 'coming', 'power', 'Tony', 'Blair', 'Michael', 'Sheen', 'Prime', 'Minster', 'death', 'Princess', 'Diana', 'Queen', 'being', 'raised', 'more', 'austere', 'times', 'particularly', 'furnace', 'Second', 'World', 'War', 'did', 'not', 'believe', 'public', 'displays', 'emotion', 'grieving', 'Add', 'fact', 'Diana', 'was', 'really', 'no', 'longer', 'member', 'Royal', 'Family', 'when', 'died', 'was', 'felt', 'death', 'was', 'private', 'affair', 'Queen', 'family', 'are', 'steeped', 'tradition', 'were', 'following', 'protocols', 'perfectly', 'way', 'were', 'intending', 'minimize', 'insult', 'Diana', 'memory', 'Prince', 'Philip', 'James', 'Cromwell', 'quite', 'supportive', 'tradition', 'Queen', 'quite', 'oblivious', 'world', 'grounds', 'Balmoral', 'other', 'did', 'not', 'appreciate', 'was', 'way', 'public', 'had', 'taken', 'Diana', 'collective', 'heart', 'was', 'celebrity', 'even', 'more', 'royalty', 'public', 'felt', 'loss', 'required', 'Queen', 'participate', 'new', 'way', 'According', 'movie', 'was', 'Tony', 'Blair', 'help', 'Prince', 'Charles', 'Alex', 'Jennings', 'who', 'played', 'key', 'role', 'helping', 'understand', 'new', 'requirement', 'was', 'actually', 'new', 'heavier', 'burden', 'public', 'placed', 'Royal', 'Family', 'public', 'did', 'not', 'not', 'care.I', 'especially', 'liked', 'way', 'Tony', 'Blair', 'appreciation', 'Elizabeth', 'way', 'role', 'pressures', 'being', 'Prime', 'Minister', 'almost', 'certainly', 'contributed', 'appreciation', 'key', 'scene', 'when', 'staff', 'bashing', 'Queen', 'yet', 'again', 'Blair', 'had', 'enough', 'straight', 'appreciation', 'should', 'have', 'her.The', 'most', 'touching', 'scenes', 'are', 'when', 'Queen', 'driving', 'Land', 'Rover', 'estate', 'wearing', 'royal', 'scarf', 'hair', 'being', 'close', 'normal', 'person', 'can', 'ever', 'be', 'Fascinating', 'touching', 'scene', 'appearance', 'gate', 'viewing', 'huge', 'displays', 'flowers', 'public', 'left', 'Diana', 'outside', 'Buckingham', 'Palace', 'Queen', 'public', 'dignity', 'very', 'insulting', 'remarks', 'family', 'know', 'how', 'much', 'her.The', 'filmmakers', 'have', 'woven', 'actual', 'footage', 'actual', 'events', 'movie', 'amazingly', 'well', 'done', 'add', 'sense', 'immediacy', 'story', 'Anyone', 'who', 'actual', 'events', 'will', 'still', 'be', 'drawn', 'movie', 'Tony', 'Blair', 'talking', 'footage', 'matched', 'carefully', 'surrounding', 'actual', 'footage', 'contemporary', 'Diana', 'death.A', 'very', 'good', 'movie', 'wonderfully', 'worth', 'seeing']",The Queen

She was convincing in one of the most difficult roles any British actress could be called upon to play, and it was also courageous of this former Bond girl, often noted in American memories for being cast as great beauties and occasional seductresses, to lose herself as completely as she did in the Queen's stately contained matronly presence. Also deserving of note is Michael Sheen's chameleon-like transformation into Tony Blair. Sheen should have gotten more acclaim than he received for the skill with which he brought a still-relevant political figure so deftly to the screen. James Cromwell was great as always as the cantankerous old tyrant Prince Phillip, and only the casting of Alex Jennings as the Prince of Wales puzzled me, as Jennings, though a sound actor, did not seem to fit the part as well as many others could have. The Queen was, I thought, a riveting take on events that remain fresh in the collective minds of people around the world, and it managed to disarm cynicism and capture a convincing account of what would ordinarily be the private moments of highly public figures. In my opinion The Queen was so much better than anything nominated against it as Best Picture at last year's Academy Awards that it represented in its loss in that category the greatest mistake in Academy voting since Shakespeare In Love displaced Saving Private Ryan to take home top honors.

Ruminating over the palace's appropriate public response to the death of the ex-communicated princess, the Queen is caught between the ever-growing clamor for an official acknowledgement of Diana's passing and what she and nearly all her consorts (except for Tony Blair, who has just been elected Prime Minister) consider a near-vulgar display of public grief (i.e., her own stiff-upper-lip resolve to act on her own terms).In the movie's most stunning scene, the Queen proceeds through the throngs that have gathered at Buckingham palace and is confronted by a child who offers a bouquet, insisting that the flowers are meant for the Queen.  Having expressed more remorse for the demise of a stag than for her former daughter-in-law, Elizabeth is surprisingly touched by this simple gesture and it reveals her humanity, however circumspect, without ever betraying the steely contenance of a long-reigning monarch.  It's also testament to the power of Mirren's daring and brilliantly nuanced performance.  ""The Queen"" also features the legendary Sylvia Sims as the Queen Mother, Micheal Sheen, who effectively approximates Tony Blair and the charming Helen McCrory as a spunky, devastatingly funny Cherie Blair--an independent, thoroughly modern and successful career woman who disdains antiquated ""royal"" formalities.

You just can't mention this brilliant movie with giving kudos to an actress who steps into the shoes of England's current monarch and makes you believe with such eery success that she IS the Queen.This movie, one of the best of the year, looks at the life of Queen Elizabeth II, during the week of Diana's death.  With Tony Blair as a beginning Prime Minister (and played to perfection by actor Michael Sheen), the Queen tries to deal with the Diana's tragic death and the public's perception of how she should grieve.  Trying to protect Diana's young sons and preferring to hide at Balmoral, the Queen brings about the wrath of her citizens, seemingly acting in a cold and uncaring way to the death of a woman loved world wide.The movie is short and conise: the director concentrating on a dramatic time in the Queen's life, a turning point that perhaps changed the idea of the monarchy for the Queen and her public.  Mirren seems to fall away, becoming a woman who can't understand how she should be forced to deal with such a private matter in public, but eventually surrendering to the will of her people.  I found one scene very interesting, in which she grieves the lost of a brilliant stag, shot on a neighboring territory.  She waves him away, hoping to save him from hunters.  To me, the stag in a sense, was like Diana, beautiful but hunted incessantly.  However, with the stag, it seemed the Queen could grieve much easier and yet found it difficult to deal with the death of her grandchildren's mother.The cast does an incredible job with their roles (James Cromwell is [...]and mean spirited as Prince Philip) and as I mentioned before, Michael Sheen becomes Tony Blair.  The one actor I didn't care for was Alex Jennings who played Prince Charles.  He never seemed to get the mannerisms and character of the Prince of Wales, though the film treats him with sympathy as opposed to the other royals.  Other than that, this movie is deserving of winning the big award, Best Picture of the Year.If you enjoy great acting, the royal family or the brilliant Helen Mirren, you must go and see this film.

Rather than taking the easy road and making Queen Elizabeth and the Royal Monarchy a target, this film chose to show both the new (Tony Blair) and the old (The Queen) in a fairly impartial light. It is much more interesting to see how both sides learn and grow from each other by being willing to communicate and learn in what must have been an extremely difficult situation. Helen Mirren gives a miraculous performance and actually appears to be channeling Her Royal Highness. As Philip, James Cromwell portrays one of the few characters in this film who is thoroughly unlikeable.

The depiction of Tony Blair is equally well done. This is an excellent film. Other reviewers have provided insights so well that I have nothing to add. Other than observing and listening to her from the days when she spoke to comfort her people as a teenage girl during the darkest days of the Blitz. (The Royal Family had chosen to remain in London throughout the war.) This is the mettle that forms great leaders. They can make mistakes in judgement, as any person can, but the great ones finally recognize their error and correct themselves. This film is about the crises surrounding the Queen when Princess Diana died in a car accident, and how she finally came to terms with it.",5,A great movie,1353715200,"11 24, 2012",2012,824,"['Helen', 'Mirram', 'portrait', 'Queen', 'Elizabeth', 'II', 'amazing', 'feel', 'are', 'watching', 'Queen', 'instead', 'very', 'skilled', 'actress', 'depiction', 'Tony', 'Blair', 'equally', 'well', 'done', 'excellent', 'film', 'Other', 'reviewers', 'have', 'provided', 'insights', 'so', 'well', 'have', 'nothing', 'add', 'Other', 'observing', 'listening', 'days', 'when', 'spoke', 'comfort', 'people', 'teenage', 'girl', 'darkest', 'days', 'Blitz', 'Royal', 'Family', 'had', 'chosen', 'remain', 'London', 'war', 'mettle', 'great', 'leaders', 'can', 'make', 'mistakes', 'judgement', 'person', 'can', 'great', 'ones', 'finally', 'recognize', 'error', 'correct', 'film', 'crises', 'surrounding', 'Queen', 'when', 'Princess', 'Diana', 'died', 'car', 'accident', 'how', 'finally', 'came', 'terms']",The Queen
647549,AEMZRE6QYVQBS,B00005JPAM,David A. Baer,"[0, 0]","Few books or films about a living monarch can avoid caricature. Royalty as a fact on the ground runs so contrary to the spirit of modernity--yet there they *are*!--and still holds such sentimental power for many 'subjects'. The result is the virtual impossibility of a civil discussion about gradated pros and cons.Into this moral sloshing about strides Stephen Frears' THE QUEEN, a movie best remembered for the command performance (queens usually ask for such a thing rather than *giving* it) of Dame  Helen Mirren as Queen Elizabeth II. Almost predictably, the film lurches into the tendency to create and caricature vilains: Cherie Blair and Prince Philip come of as genuine awfuls occupying opposite extremes of the ideological spectrum. Prince Charles and Alisdair Campbell are almost as bad.One might argue that Fears did not *create* those villains, simply portrayed them within an acceptable range of their already existing awfulness. This is plausible. Most of us will never know because we will never know *them*.Yet I find THE QUEEN a gripping film because of its superb narration of a dialogue-of-wary-respect between Blair and the Queen. Mrs Blair even accuses the young prime minister of 'going over' to the royals just as all Labour MPs have gone 'gaga' when given access to them.A word of parenthesis: this American reviewer was living in England at the time of Diana's death, the occasioning fact of this cinematic drama. My family and I had no particular opinion regarding Diana and certainly did not revere her. Yet we found ourselves caught up in the astonishing emotional outpouring that gripped Great Britain and to some extent the wider world in the week following her death. Something happened outside a Paris tunnel that week that none of us would have anticipated and that few understand to this day.It is easy for me to imagine that Blair's conversations with the Queen were just about as Fears depicts them and that this *was* one of those positive outcomes that occasionally ensue when two people of strong character invade each other's company because of circumstances that neither one would have chosen.I find the physical, visual portrayal of Blair unconvincing, though this is hardly fatal to the movie's success. Helen Mirren as the Queen, on the other hand, seems almost eerily true to fact.This flawed but ultimately stirring movie is worth owning and returning to from time to time as distance readjusts the lens on a memory that remains unshakably present for those of us who lived through the events at close hand.",4,there's been a change,1196467200,"12 1, 2007",2007,2554,"['Few', 'books', 'films', 'living', 'monarch', 'can', 'avoid', 'caricature', 'Royalty', 'fact', 'ground', 'so', 'contrary', 'spirit', 'modernity', 'yet', '*are*', 'still', 'such', 'sentimental', 'power', 'many', ""'subjects"", 'result', 'virtual', 'impossibility', 'civil', 'discussion', 'gradated', 'pros', 'cons.Into', 'moral', 'sloshing', 'about', 'strides', 'Stephen', 'Frears', 'THE', 'QUEEN', 'movie', 'best', 'remembered', 'command', 'performance', 'usually', 'ask', 'such', 'thing', 'rather', '*giving*', 'Dame', 'Helen', 'Mirren', 'Queen', 'Elizabeth', 'II', 'Almost', 'predictably', 'film', 'tendency', 'create', 'caricature', 'vilains', 'Cherie', 'Blair', 'Prince', 'Philip', 'come', 'genuine', 'occupying', 'opposite', 'extremes', 'ideological', 'spectrum', 'Prince', 'Charles', 'Alisdair', 'Campbell', 'are', 'almost', 'bad.One', 'might', 'argue', 'Fears', 'did', 'not', '*create*', 'villains', 'simply', 'portrayed', 'acceptable', 'range', 'already', 'existing', 'awfulness', 'plausible', 'Most', 'will', 'never', 'know', 'will', 'never', 'know', '*them*.Yet', 'find', 'QUEEN', 'gripping', 'film', 'superb', 'narration', 'dialogue-of-wary-respect', 'Blair', 'Queen', 'Mrs', 'Blair', 'even', 'young', 'prime', 'minister', ""'going"", 'royals', 'just', 'Labour', 'MPs', 'have', 'gone', ""'gaga"", 'when', 'given', 'access', 'them.A', 'word', 'parenthesis', 'American', 'reviewer', 'was', 'living', 'England', 'time', 'Diana', 'death', 'occasioning', 'fact', 'cinematic', 'drama', 'family', 'had', 'particular', 'opinion', 'regarding', 'Diana', 'certainly', 'did', 'not', 'revere', 'found', 'caught', 'up', 'astonishing', 'emotional', 'outpouring', 'gripped', 'Great', 'Britain', 'extent', 'wider', 'world', 'week', 'following', 'death', 'Something', 'happened', 'Paris', 'tunnel', 'week', 'none', 'would', 'have', 'anticipated', 'few', 'understand', 'day.It', 'easy', 'imagine', 'Blair', 'conversations', 'Queen', 'were', 'just', 'about', 'Fears', 'one', 'positive', 'outcomes', 'occasionally', 'ensue', 'when', 'two', 'people', 'strong', 'character', 'invade', 'other', 'company', 'circumstances', 'one', 'would', 'have', 'chosen.I', 'find', 'physical', 'visual', 'portrayal', 'Blair', 'unconvincing', 'hardly', 'fatal', 'movie', 'success', 'Helen', 'Mirren', 'Queen', 'other', 'hand', 'almost', 'eerily', 'true', 'fact.This', 'flawed', 'ultimately', 'stirring', 'movie', 'worth', 'owning', 'returning', 'time', 'time', 'distance', 'lens', 'memory', 'unshakably', 'present', 'who', 'lived', 'events', 'close', 'hand']",The Queen

The Queen is a well acted, thought provoking film.  I cannot comment on what might have been left out, was invented or compressed to tell the story of the Royal family in the aftermath of the death of Princess Diana but what we do see rings true with the information that is generally known.  The performance by Helen Mirren is Oscar caliber; my test for a performance is how convinced I am that the actor has become the role and Ms. Mirren is Queen Elizabeth II.  Indeed, the entire cast is superb.  Michael Sheen is terrific as Tony Blair and expresses a good range of emotion dealing sternly with his staff, diplomatically with the Queen and coping with family life.  James Cromwell is also good as Prince Philip exhibiting perhaps the ultimate stiff upper lip attitude of the English upper class. Equally good is Sylvia Syms as the Queen Mother, who is most concerned, so it seems that Diana's public funeral is being based off her own.  Alex Jennings makes an interesting Prince Charles; although he does not look a lot like Charles he worked into his performance the Prince's mannerismsThe audience is treated to what amounts to the daily life of the Queen on summer holiday at the family estate at Balmoral.  This otherwise peaceful retreat is interrupted by the death of Princess Diana on August 30, 1997 and becomes a chronological telling of the events that occurs up to her funeral.  The film does not take a point-of-view and does not present very much about Princess Diana other than glimpses of her public life, which allows us to focus on how the Royal family dealt with her death.  It is going on ten years since the events depicted in the film occurred giving all of us a better perspective on what happened.  At the time, the Royal family came under harsh criticism for their perceived lack of reaction to Princess Diana's death; this film provides all sides and allows us to better understand the Queen and her reaction first to the death of the princess and then to the criticism of her conduct.The episode of the stag in the film is one of the events that may be fictional but it serves to remind us that Princess Diana, like the stag, was hunted for her beauty.  The Queen makes this connection in the film and so her attempt to shoo the animal away when she encounters it and her quiet sorrow when he is killed.  I think that one comes away with a better understanding of Queen Elizabeth, and one can see the influence of past generations - that of her grandmother Queen Mary - in her attitude toward the public life that she inherited from her father.

647551,AAE2DUEMTR30I,B00005JPAM,DAVID BRYSON,"[39, 42]","There are several themes to this excellent and most original and interesting film; but what it is about more than anything else is how political regimes and whole dynasties can be undone on account of a single error of judgment. It is only near the end that Her Majesty warns her prime minister that this will happen to him, and happen suddenly and without warning. It had nearly happened to her, he had been the saving of her on this occasion, and her dire prediction for him probably holds an uneasy message for herself too.At the start the Queen is full of regal self-assurance, neatly putting her boyish and slightly nervous novice of a prime minister in his place by telling him he is sitting where Churchill once sat. In next to no time the positions are reversed, as Blair's acute political antennae tell him that HM is in imminent danger of losing her subjects' allegiance, something that would have been unimaginable only days previously, through trusting her own judgment and listening to the advice of her husband and her mother in respect of how to react to the death of Princess Diana. Throughout the crisis Blair is adroit and sure-footed, the monarch is made to realise bitterly from the newspapers how he has it right and she has been hopelessly at sea, but unlike her family counsellors she has the wit to swallow her pride and retrieve the situation before it slides beyond retrieval. This one incident could have undone a lifetime of unswerving dedication, universally acknowledged, to her country, and put the skids under the House of Windsor itself. Her warning to Blair is really made from a new sense of respect and a shocked realisation of how quickly and brutally the tables can turn. And how right she has been. This film does not make the matter explicit, but any viewer can sense the irony of Blair's own political fate. For years he seemed unable to put a foot wrong as far as the public were concerned, his luck was near-incredible (and his political nous was enormously greater than Churchill's); and then he blew it all with one foolish and ill-considered assertion in the Commons about weapons of mass destruction in Iraq. Just one mistake, when one is not sensing danger, is enough.The depiction of the main players is brilliant, and I found it fascinating to guess just how accurate it may be. Leaks, rumours, gossip and memoirs certainly descend on the public these days like leaves in Vallombrosa, giving us some shaky basis for forming a judgment. In the nature of the case a prime minister has to make himself (or herself) familiar to a rightly suspicious electorate, but a monarch should always retain some mystique, and the other dramatis personae, even the heir to the throne, are only intermittently in the limelight. Inevitably and rightly the film's characterisation is creative, but it is coherent and convincing provided one does not mistake it for portraiture from life. The acting has been widely praised and I concur entirely. The atmosphere is beautifully touched in too, from the family life of the Blairs (and the Windsors) to the blokeish informality of the New Labour apparatchiks in Downing Street and above all the hushed flunkeyish reverence accorded to the Queen, cocooning her in the chrysalis that nearly devoured her.I hope there is no possibility of a sequel, as a masterpiece like this should be left unique. Within days now Her Britannic Majesty will be welcoming a new prime minister whom she probably suspects of being a closet republican, as I suspect he is too. I shall be watching out all the same for one thing that this film says clearly through the lips of Cherie Blair, something to the effect that all Labour prime ministers finish up devoted to the Queen. Maybe it will be the same story with Brown, but I wonder how matters will stand once the monarch is no longer Elizabeth II. When that becomes the case the story of Princess Diana is likely to open a new chapter.",5,A CLOSE CALL,1181433600,"06 10, 2007",2007,3943,"['are', 'several', 'themes', 'excellent', 'most', 'original', 'interesting', 'film', 'what', 'more', 'anything', 'else', 'how', 'political', 'regimes', 'whole', 'dynasties', 'can', 'be', 'undone', 'account', 'single', 'error', 'judgment', 'only', 'end', 'Majesty', 'prime', 'minister', 'will', 'happen', 'happen', 'suddenly', 'warning', 'had', 'nearly', 'happened', 'had', 'been', 'saving', 'occasion', 'dire', 'prediction', 'probably', 'uneasy', 'message', 'too.At', 'start', 'Queen', 'full', 'regal', 'self-assurance', 'neatly', 'putting', 'boyish', 'slightly', 'nervous', 'novice', 'prime', 'minister', 'place', 'telling', 'sitting', 'where', 'Churchill', 'once', 'sat', 'next', 'time', 'positions', 'are', 'reversed', 'Blair', 'acute', 'political', 'antennae', 'tell', 'HM', 'imminent', 'danger', 'losing', 'subjects', 'allegiance', 'something', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'unimaginable', 'only', 'days', 'previously', 'trusting', 'own', 'judgment', 'listening', 'advice', 'husband', 'mother', 'respect', 'how', 'react', 'death', 'Princess', 'Diana', 'crisis', 'Blair', 'adroit', 'sure-footed', 'monarch', 'made', 'realise', 'bitterly', 'newspapers', 'how', 'right', 'been', 'hopelessly', 'sea', 'family', 'counsellors', 'wit', 'swallow', 'pride', 'retrieve', 'situation', 'retrieval', 'one', 'incident', 'could', 'have', 'undone', 'lifetime', 'unswerving', 'dedication', 'universally', 'acknowledged', 'country', 'put', 'skids', 'House', 'Windsor', 'warning', 'Blair', 'really', 'made', 'new', 'sense', 'respect', 'shocked', 'realisation', 'how', 'quickly', 'brutally', 'tables', 'can', 'turn', 'how', 'right', 'been', 'film', 'not', 'make', 'matter', 'explicit', 'viewer', 'can', 'sense', 'irony', 'Blair', 'own', 'political', 'fate', 'years', 'seemed', 'unable', 'put', 'foot', 'wrong', 'as', 'far', 'public', 'were', 'concerned', 'luck', 'was', 'near-incredible', 'political', 'nous', 'was', 'enormously', 'greater', 'Churchill', 'then', 'blew', 'one', 'foolish', 'ill-considered', 'assertion', 'Commons', 'weapons', 'mass', 'destruction', 'Iraq', 'Just', 'one', 'mistake', 'when', 'one', 'not', 'sensing', 'danger', 'enough.The', 'depiction', 'main', 'players', 'brilliant', 'found', 'fascinating', 'guess', 'just', 'how', 'accurate', 'may', 'be', 'Leaks', 'rumours', 'gossip', 'certainly', 'descend', 'public', 'days', 'like', 'leaves', 'Vallombrosa', 'giving', 'shaky', 'basis', 'forming', 'judgment', 'nature', 'case', 'prime', 'minister', 'make', 'familiar', 'rightly', 'suspicious', 'electorate', 'monarch', 'should', 'always', 'retain', 'mystique', 'other', 'dramatis', 'personae', 'even', 'heir', 'throne', 'are', 'only', 'intermittently', 'limelight', 'Inevitably', 'rightly', 'film', 'characterisation', 'creative', 'coherent', 'convincing', 'provided', 'one', 'not', 'mistake', 'portraiture', 'life', 'acting', 'been', 'widely', 'praised', 'concur', 'entirely', 'atmosphere', 'beautifully', 'touched', 'too', 'family', 'life', 'Blairs', 'Windsors', 'blokeish', 'informality', 'New', 'Labour', 'apparatchiks', 'Downing', 'Street', 'hushed', 'flunkeyish', 'reverence', 'accorded', 'Queen', 'cocooning', 'chrysalis', 'nearly', 'devoured', 'her.I', 'hope', 'possibility', 'sequel', 'masterpiece', 'should', 'be', 'left', 'unique', 'Within', 'days', 'now', 'Her', 'Britannic', 'Majesty', 'will', 'be', 'welcoming', 'new', 'prime', 'minister', 'whom', 'probably', 'suspects', 'being', 'closet', 'republican', 'suspect', 'too', 'shall', 'be', 'watching', 'same', 'one', 'thing', 'film', 'clearly', 'lips', 'Cherie', 'Blair', 'something', 'effect', 'Labour', 'prime', 'ministers', 'finish', 'up', 'devoted', 'Queen', 'Maybe', 'will', 'be', 'same', 'story', 'Brown', 'wonder', 'how', 'matters', 'will', 'stand', 'once', 'monarch', 'no', 'longer', 'Elizabeth', 'II', 'When', 'case', 'story', 'Princess', 'Diana', 'likely', 'open', 'new', 'chapter']",The Queen

Of course, viewers loved it. The point is that Ms Mirren has always been a daring, courageous actress, and I suspect it took a lot of guts for her to do the Queen. She is good, and the film isn't bad, although I suspect it will be remembered chiefly for the performances. The story is compelling, but the conflict seems very particular to its time, a unique and disturbing moment, but not one that points to universals.

647557,A11ES13Y64903L,B00005JPAM,Debra Morse,"[4, 4]","In Stephen Frears and Peter Morgan`s ""The Queen"", Helen Mirren gives a spot-on brilliant portrayal of Queen Elizabeth II during arguably the darkest days of her reign: those following the untimely death of Princess Diana.  Through this narrow door of one week's time the audience is provided a wide-angle view of the entirety of the 20th century Elizabethan era, from the effects of the abdication of Edward VIII, through ten prime ministers, to the 1997 arrival of Blair. This portal additionally allows us to see much of the character of PM Tony Blair (played magnificently by Michael Sheen) during the early days of his government.Interspersed with genuine newsreel footage of Diana and the Paris crash, the bulk of the film takes place with the Queen in Balmoral and Blair in No. 10, as the rest of the world sits stunned and shocked at reports of the Alma tunnel crash. Sweeping and glorious panoramas of the Scottish highlands fade in to vistas of flowers piled outside Kensington. The Queen drives around in her Rover tending to her dogs as Blair is driven around London while dealing with the press.With the Royal Family holed up in their country home in apparent dismissive denial (""Have you heard from the Spencers on what they wish to do with the funeral?""), and a national populace increasingly frustrated by their response, Blair deftly tries to maneuver the monarch into a more sympathetic attitude, all the while deferring to the megalith that is the institution of ER-II. The film shows the delicate interplay of prime minister and monarch, sparing us none of the cagey-ness, mutual respect, and suspicion. Marvelous parallels are drawn between the stalking of a stag on the Balmoral grounds and the stalking and death of the Princess of Wales.Mirren's performance is Oscar worthy. At this writing she has already bagged the Best Actress award at Venice, and will no doubt carry a major sweep of all gilded statues.  She effects a beautiful balance of the stony matronly monarch and the vulnerable womanly mother and grandmother without once giving way to stereotype or parody. She adds great humor to the film with the slightest flicker of a smirk or icy glare. She employs the ever-present purse carried by Her Majesty (why? why?) to great effect.The supporting cast is likewise magnificent and should garner their own share of honors. Syliva Sims is particularly engaging as the jaded, hunched, martini swilling dowager  queen mother. There are no punches pulled vis a vis the characters:Philip is boorish, Cherie Blair is irreverent, Charles is conflicted. Yet each is treated respectfully, and the overall portrayal is realistic and compassionate.Wittily written, wonderfully filmed, and masterfully edited; this is well worth the viewing and will stand the test of time.",4,Mirren is Magnificent,1161475200,"10 22, 2006",2006,2792,"['Stephen', 'Frears', 'Peter', 'Morgan', 's', 'Queen', 'Helen', 'Mirren', 'spot-on', 'brilliant', 'portrayal', 'Queen', 'Elizabeth', 'II', 'arguably', 'darkest', 'days', 'reign', 'following', 'untimely', 'death', 'Princess', 'Diana', 'narrow', 'door', 'one', 'week', 'time', 'audience', 'provided', 'wide-angle', 'view', 'entirety', '20th', 'century', 'Elizabethan', 'era', 'effects', 'abdication', 'Edward', 'VIII', 'ten', 'prime', 'ministers', '1997', 'arrival', 'Blair', 'portal', 'additionally', 'see', 'much', 'character', 'PM', 'Tony', 'Blair', 'played', 'magnificently', 'Michael', 'Sheen', 'early', 'days', 'government.Interspersed', 'genuine', 'newsreel', 'footage', 'Diana', 'Paris', 'crash', 'bulk', 'film', 'place', 'Queen', 'Balmoral', 'Blair', 'No', '10', 'rest', 'world', 'stunned', 'shocked', 'reports', 'Alma', 'tunnel', 'crash', 'Sweeping', 'glorious', 'panoramas', 'Scottish', 'highlands', 'fade', 'vistas', 'flowers', 'piled', 'Kensington', 'Queen', 'drives', 'Rover', 'tending', 'dogs', 'Blair', 'driven', 'London', 'dealing', 'press.With', 'Royal', 'Family', 'holed', 'up', 'country', 'home', 'apparent', 'dismissive', 'denial', 'Have', 'heard', 'Spencers', 'what', 'wish', 'do', 'funeral', 'national', 'populace', 'increasingly', 'frustrated', 'response', 'Blair', 'deftly', 'maneuver', 'monarch', 'more', 'sympathetic', 'attitude', 'while', 'deferring', 'megalith', 'institution', 'ER-II', 'film', 'delicate', 'interplay', 'prime', 'minister', 'monarch', 'sparing', 'none', 'cagey-ness', 'mutual', 'respect', 'suspicion', 'Marvelous', 'parallels', 'are', 'drawn', 'stalking', 'stag', 'Balmoral', 'grounds', 'stalking', 'death', 'Princess', 'Wales.Mirren', 'performance', 'Oscar', 'worthy', 'writing', 'already', 'bagged', 'Best', 'Actress', 'award', 'Venice', 'will', 'doubt', 'carry', 'major', 'sweep', 'gilded', 'statues', 'effects', 'beautiful', 'balance', 'stony', 'matronly', 'monarch', 'vulnerable', 'womanly', 'mother', 'grandmother', 'once', 'giving', 'way', 'stereotype', 'parody', 'great', 'humor', 'film', 'slightest', 'flicker', 'smirk', 'icy', 'glare', 'ever-present', 'purse', 'carried', 'Her', 'Majesty', 'why', 'why', 'great', 'effect.The', 'supporting', 'cast', 'likewise', 'magnificent', 'should', 'garner', 'own', 'share', 'honors', 'Syliva', 'Sims', 'particularly', 'engaging', 'jaded', 'hunched', 'martini', 'swilling', 'dowager', 'queen', 'mother', 'are', 'punches', 'pulled', 'vis', 'vis', 'characters', 'Philip', 'boorish', 'Cherie', 'Blair', 'irreverent', 'Charles', 'conflicted', 'treated', 'respectfully', 'overall', 'portrayal', 'realistic', 'compassionate.Wittily', 'written', 'wonderfully', 'filmed', 'masterfully', 'edited', 'well', 'viewing', 'will', 'stand', 'test', 'time']",The Queen

My cousin Marcy is a huge Diana freak and won't see it because of the views. I found the film adaptation of history interesting, and there really was a blurred line between what actually happened and what didn't happen. It was meshed together from what happened publically, interviews with some people (publically and off the record), and fictional creative license.This was one of the best movies of the year. I honestly don't think it will win Best Picture (it is nominated) because the entire thing wasn't great. For example, the cinematography bothered us from time to time. The guy who played Tony Blair was well done, and he, uncanningly, looked like him. I liked the juxtaposition between his family and the royal family. Now onto Helen Mirren. Anyone who votes against her for the Best Actress award is a fool. She's a shoo-in. She will win. I said it here first. Helen Mirren BECAME QE2 in this film. Sometimes I watch actors or actresses and think ""Damn, so and so is doing a job playing so and so"" but it wasn't like that for me here.

On one hand, Helen Mirren's performance as Queen Elizabeth II is nothing short of stunning, and is much deserving of the Oscar and all other awards bestowed upon her... The script, however, left me a bit flat. It seemed rather conventional and TV-movie-of-the-weekish, and rather insular as well. Screenwriter Peter Morgan assumes a great deal from his audience, most of all that we have already shared in the media mania that surrounded Princess Diana, and are all well steeped in the twists and turns of her life story, and in her relationship to the royal family. Of course, millions and millions of people are well-versed in the minutae of that story, but for those of us who were casual and neutral observers, this movie does a poor job explaining what transpired, and the significance of various events and personal histories. A great deal of familiarity with the royal family is taken for granted, and we are expected to know their personalities -- the steadfast Elizabeth, the dithering Prince Charles, the bigoted Prince Philip. We're also expected to know their place in the national psyche of Great Britain, and to really feel the dramatic heft and social significance of the commoners rebelling against the old-world propriety of the nobles. In many regards, it's amazing that this film played as well as it did to the American audience... I suppose it's due to two factors, the enduring tabloid appeal of the late Diana, and to Helen Mirren's masterful performance. It's an impressive bit of acting, buoyed by other first-class actors...

647566,A3RTMB76CJWY9U,B00005JPAM,DonAthos,"[6, 6]","The Queen starts out unambitiously enough. Elizabeth II, Queen of England, meeting the newly-elected Prime Minister, Tony Blair, a young up-and-comer who is determined to shake things up a bit in government. Elizabeth assures Blair, through her ceremony, forms, and observation that she has survived ten Prime Ministers (her own education in such relations starting with none other than Winston Churchill), that she will not be shaken up. That it is the young-buck Blair who has everything to learn, and not the stolid, stoic Queen.Of course, Elizabeth was raised in a different time and age. Ensconced in various palaces, she rarely gets the opportunity to see what the realm she ironically leads, is like. When her ex-daughter-in-law, the popular Diana, tragically dies in an auto accident, Elizabeth has no conception of what a storm it will set off, both in Britain and the world. She has no *ability* to conceive of it, either: she believes that death is a private affair, and that England is a country of people who are as private and guarded as is she. On top of that, she personally bears Diana no particular goodwill, and so Elizabeth decides to treat Diana's death as a non-event.But the British people--a different British people than Elizabeth imagines--demands a response. Demands a human, feeling monarchy. Blair, the new man of the people, represents this to the Queen, and so we are introduced to a struggle of wills between the old, controlled, powerful Queen, and the new face of Blair. It is also a struggle, more generally, between tradition and change. If you know what normally wins that struggle, or you remember these particular events in your own lifetime, then you know which side wins.Elizabeth is presented an impossible choice: change and relent, or the monarchy, itself, will crack. It is a wonderfully dramatic scenario, and thrilling to watch it portrayed by such a talented, capable actress. Mirren will win the Best Actress Oscar, and she will deserve it.It is also fun to watch other famous characters, such as Blair and Prince Charles, portrayed. It's hard to not like Blair in this film (as he eventually comes around to respect the monarchy he once found silly and dated), and hard not to feel sorry for him in his own, more recent, fall from popular approval. Prince Charles is another matter all-together: it is moving to watch him grieve for Diana, and painful to watch how this man (the would-be King of England) is so bowed over and controlled by others in his life. Despite the fact that the Queen is the centerpiece, the others are all interesting character studies in their own right.It is rare to have a historical film about events so recent, revolving around people still living and capable (and, in fact, still in power). It's nice to be given this sort of insight into the people we still see on the news, to be able to reconsider our once-held notions of them, instead of waiting until they're long-dead to reflect. The Queen provides us with this rare opportunity, and it does so in an entertaining and brilliantly acted way.This is a wonderful movie.Five stars.",5,Cracks Appear in the All-Too Human Queen,1171152000,"02 11, 2007",2007,3115,"['Queen', 'out', 'unambitiously', 'enough', 'Elizabeth', 'II', 'Queen', 'England', 'meeting', 'newly-elected', 'Prime', 'Minister', 'Tony', 'Blair', 'young', 'up-and-comer', 'who', 'determined', 'shake', 'things', 'up', 'bit', 'government', 'Elizabeth', 'Blair', 'ceremony', 'forms', 'observation', 'survived', 'ten', 'Prime', 'Ministers', 'own', 'education', 'such', 'relations', 'starting', 'none', 'other', 'Winston', 'Churchill', 'will', 'not', 'be', 'shaken', 'up', 'young-buck', 'Blair', 'who', 'everything', 'learn', 'not', 'stolid', 'stoic', 'Queen.Of', 'course', 'Elizabeth', 'was', 'raised', 'different', 'time', 'age', 'Ensconced', 'various', 'palaces', 'rarely', 'opportunity', 'see', 'what', 'realm', 'ironically', 'When', 'ex-daughter-in-law', 'popular', 'Diana', 'tragically', 'auto', 'accident', 'Elizabeth', 'conception', 'what', 'storm', 'will', 'set', 'off', 'Britain', 'world', '*ability*', 'conceive', 'either', 'death', 'private', 'affair', 'England', 'country', 'people', 'who', 'are', 'private', 'guarded', 'top', 'personally', 'Diana', 'particular', 'goodwill', 'so', 'Elizabeth', 'treat', 'Diana', 'death', 'non-event.But', 'British', 'people', 'different', 'British', 'people', 'Elizabeth', 'imagines', 'response', 'human', 'feeling', 'monarchy', 'Blair', 'new', 'man', 'people', 'Queen', 'so', 'are', 'introduced', 'struggle', 'wills', 'old', 'controlled', 'powerful', 'Queen', 'new', 'face', 'Blair', 'also', 'struggle', 'more', 'generally', 'tradition', 'change', 'know', 'what', 'normally', 'struggle', 'remember', 'particular', 'events', 'own', 'lifetime', 'then', 'know', 'side', 'wins.Elizabeth', 'presented', 'impossible', 'choice', 'change', 'relent', 'monarchy', 'will', 'crack', 'wonderfully', 'dramatic', 'scenario', 'thrilling', 'watch', 'portrayed', 'such', 'talented', 'capable', 'actress', 'Mirren', 'will', 'win', 'Best', 'Actress', 'Oscar', 'will', 'deserve', 'it.It', 'also', 'fun', 'watch', 'other', 'famous', 'characters', 'such', 'Blair', 'Prince', 'Charles', 'portrayed', 'hard', 'not', 'like', 'Blair', 'film', 'eventually', 'respect', 'monarchy', 'once', 'found', 'silly', 'dated', 'hard', 'not', 'feel', 'sorry', 'own', 'more', 'recent', 'fall', 'popular', 'approval', 'Prince', 'Charles', 'matter', 'all-together', 'moving', 'watch', 'grieve', 'Diana', 'painful', 'watch', 'how', 'man', 'would-be', 'King', 'England', 'so', 'bowed', 'controlled', 'others', 'life', 'fact', 'Queen', 'centerpiece', 'others', 'are', 'interesting', 'character', 'studies', 'own', 'right.It', 'rare', 'have', 'historical', 'film', 'events', 'so', 'recent', 'revolving', 'people', 'still', 'living', 'capable', 'fact', 'still', 'power', 'nice', 'be', 'given', 'sort', 'insight', 'people', 'still', 'see', 'news', 'be', 'able', 'reconsider', 'once-held', 'notions', 'instead', 'waiting', ""'re"", 'long-dead', 'reflect', 'Queen', 'rare', 'opportunity', 'so', 'entertaining', 'brilliantly', 'acted', 'way.This', 'wonderful', 'movie.Five', 'stars']",The Queen

Though both Helen Mirren and Michael Sheen give outstanding Oscar-worthy performances the real star/hero of this film is, as you might expect, Lady Di.Most people already know that virtually everyone in the world adored Lady Di while she was alive and that many experienced her death almost as a personal loss; and that many people continue to view her as one of the late twentieth-century's most intriguing and personable icons. Frears certainly knows the iconic value of Lady Di and just how she was and continues to be perceived by not only the British people but the people of the world. To the people of the world she is a person who embodied glamor and grace in a way no public figure had done before or has done since, and on top of that she bravely defied the life-denying royal protocols and out-of-date traditions that were no longer responsive to the people's needs and merely put a great chasm between the royals and real life. While the rest of the royals went about their merry way blissfully out-of-touch with the way they were being perceived by the modern world and blissfully dysfunctional as human beings, Lady Di was the one person who remained in touch with her instincts and emotions and in touch with the people. And it was these displays of genuine human qualities and emotion in interview after interview that gave people something to connect with and admire. Lady Di's attempt to break free from the old royal ways represented to the English people their own desire to break free from the stultifying confines of tradition. One could say that Lady Di was a modern in a house full of ancients (who still believed it was ok for Prince Charles to have a mistress; and to hunt stags and foxes just for fun). Even though Lady Di had no real political power she had tremendous symbolic power and when she died Tony Blair, because he knew what she represented to the people, immediately appreciated how deeply her loss would be felt. Tony Blair also immediately appreciated that it was important not to try and turn Lady Di's death into an opportunity for personal political gain even though the opportunity was there. But without even trying, or simply by trying to do the decent thing and not the most advantageous thing politically Blair came across as a decent guy and a guy that acted and thought like Lady Di herself who always put people before politics.To the royals, however, Lady Di was just a thorn in their side and her death only aggravated an already deep wound. To them her open defiance of royal ways was an assault on English tradition and decorum and her affiliations with celebrities and playboys as well as her open criticism of Charles and the rest of the royals in the press just seemed undiginified and vulgar. To the people of course Lady Di's dalliances seemed like much deserved breaths of fresh air after years of royal confinement. Though Lady Di never espoused any political views of her own, her highly publicized struggles with the royal family forever wounded the publics image of all things royal. Still, despite these well publicized differences, the public expected the Queen to be magnanimous and to eulogize Lady Di in some public way. The British and world press certainly did not expect the Queen to be petty but that is exactly how the British and world press perceived the Queen's week-long silence that followed that fatal car crash in Paris.In many ways Lady Di remains the star of this picture. Every time we see another interview or any video footage of her we are in awe of how powerful her image was and remains. The Queen, on the other hand, is not loved and no one knows this more than she. But she is not portrayed here as simply the much maligned princess-nemesis that you might expect. This film takes an equivocal approach and allows us an insiders glimpse in to how the story played out in both the royal and Blair households that week in 1997 and the film also allows us to understand exactly why each person responded the way they did. By allowing us an especially close behind-the-scenes look at the inner-workings of two very distinct political minds with very different social & political backgrounds and points of view we find, to our surprise, that Tony Blair and the Queen, as far apart as they are on the political spectrum, do indeed have something in common: a respect for decency and a sense of themselves as selfless public servants; and even though they show that decency and play their roles in radically different ways both ultimately come off as essentially decent people and by films end we even feel that these two may get on rather nicely. And so the real revelation here is that the Queen mum is actually a human being who just isn't that good at relating with her subjects and Blair's the guy who is credited with providing the Queen with some much needed emotional counsel & public relations advice. What we see is a Queen that does hold an obvious grudge against Diana but we also see that she needs her subjects emotional support just as much as they need her public display of emotion. This is trying for her because she is not used to showing emotion publicly, in fact she's been trained all of her life not to show emotion and Blair is sensitive to this generational difference in attitude toward what is and is not appropriate. Its only Tony Blair himself who sees what the Queen is really like and its only Blair who can finesse the Queen into reversing her earlier miscalculation and to make a public statement in recognition of Lady Di without making her feel publicly or politically humiliated. Blair is sensitive to public opinion but he also realizes that the press and the public are not always spot-on when it comes to assessing the lives of public figures, especially their inner lives. His public sympathies are with the very popular Lady Di but privately his sympathy is, surprisingly, with the Queen.As the Queen, Mirren gives a touching performance, and one full of the kinds of subtleties and nuances that only the worlds greatest actresses are capable of delivering. Her skill is not just in making the Queen likable but also in allowing us to comprehend this profoundly conservative woman. Mirren gives her humor and heart, and the scene where we see the Queen suddenly and unexpectedly overcome by the grief that she actually feels is as surprising to us as it is to her.What's so graceful about this film is its ability to use the Lady Di tragedy as a way to heal both personal and political wounds, and to find  the higher common ground that unites people of all political persuasions. The films idealism is a worthy tribute to the legacy of Lady Di. The Queen is an easy film to like and one of the rare films that actually makes you feel good.The press takes a good slapping on the wrist and they deserve it but they are not the only ones villainized. The real bad guys here are the ones who pay closer attention to politics than to people and thus live in their heads instead of their hearts. In the royal household the Queen's husband, Prince Philip, comes off as not just emotionally cold but rather indifferent to the Lady Di tragedy and to human feeling in general; his own emotional life, stunted as it is, provides him with no way of comprehending the depth of public feeling that Lady Di inspires. The only emotion that he seems capable of expressing is resentment; he has no real feeling for the people, and the people none for him. He represents the royals at their worst as he lives in a cocoon of privilege completely cut-off from real world events. In comparison, Prince Charles actually comes across as well-intentioned and capable of compassion and sympathy; although he is portrayed as painfully awkward and hopelessly ineffectual as a public figure, he is also potrayed as a good father, and a caring ex-husband. Although funny and witty and in many ways very likable because always ready with a clever quip or retort Blair's key analyst/speechwriter, Alastair Campbell, does not come off much better than the Queens' husband in the final analysis as he is incapable of seeing the Lady Di tragedy as anything but a political opportunity. Though its Mirren as the Queen and Michael Sheen as Blair that will win Oscar nods (and deservedly so) this subtle portrait of a scheming progressive also deserves notice.",5,Fascinating Portrait of

Tony Blair walks the line between his sympathy toward those who see Diana as a people's princess, and his sympathy for the Queen, who carries herself with dignity no matter the situation.Helen Mirren is awesome as the Queen, and the guy who plays Tony Blair does a great job, too.

But one of the nastiest hits to them in the twentieth century came when Princess Di was killed.And so ""The Queen"" tries to get inside the perfectly-permed head of the British Queen Elizabeth II, nearly ten years ago. Helen Mirren gives an Oscar-worthy performance as the title character, as she attempts to weather public and personal difficulties. Uneasy lies the head that wears a crown.The movie opens with the election of Tony Blair (Michael Sheen), who comes to visit the queen (Mirren), despite being rather nervous about his new job. The country has been off balance ever since Di died in a car crash a few weeks ago, and her passing leaves the royals with mixed feelings. The queen decrees that since Diana divorced Prince Charles, she was no longer a royal, and her arrangements are to be left to her family.What she doesn't realize is that the people ADORED Diana, and continue to adore her in the weeks that follow. Then the press joins in, berating the royal family for coldly ignoring the ex-princess, and heralding the Labour Party Blair. Her husband and mother think that she should continue doing nothing -- but the Queen has learned that sometimes the people need to be appeased.""The Queen"" unfolds slowly like an old book, and Stephen Frears gives it the dignified gloss that usually belongs to older movies. Scenes that could have been maudlin or cliche are underplayed, which makes them more powerful. One example is of the queen peering in as Charles tells his young sons that their mother has died.Fortunately, as in real life, there's also comedy as well as confusion and tragedy; Peter Morgan injects some humor when a nervy Blair meets the Queen for the first time. Morgan also spins u[ the kind of dialogue we can imagine the droll Elizabeth or prickly Prince Philip saying (""Sleeping in the streets and pulling out their hair for someone they never knew. And they think WE'RE mad!"").Mirren doesn't normally look much like Elizabeth II. She's younger, taller, and prettier. But with some padding and makeup, she manages to BECOME Elizabeth II. She's dignified, haughty, yet Mirren manages to bring across that she's bewildered and vulnerable as well. In short, she makes her version of Elizabeth II a person.She's also backed by magnificent performances by Sheen and James Cromwell. Cromwell is excellent as the crotchety, stubborn Prince Philip, who thinks the best way to deal with grief is to go hunting. And Sheen is very good as the Prime Minister who is just starting his work, and who gains a new perspective on the royals.""The Queen"" is a unique, quietly compelling film, as it explores what might have happened within the royal family -- and the person that Queen Elizabeth might be, underneath the royal mask.",5,The Queen rules,1163808000,"11 18, 2006",2006,2816,"['British', 'royal', 'family', 'weathered', 'abdications', 'wars', 'scandal', 'one', 'nastiest', 'hits', 'twentieth', 'century', 'came', 'when', 'Princess', 'Di', 'was', 'killed.And', 'so', 'Queen', 'get', 'perfectly-permed', 'head', 'British', 'Queen', 'Elizabeth', 'II', 'nearly', 'ten', 'years', 'ago', 'Helen', 'Mirren', 'Oscar-worthy', 'performance', 'title', 'character', 'weather', 'public', 'personal', 'difficulties', 'Uneasy', 'head', 'crown.The', 'movie', 'election', 'Tony', 'Blair', 'Michael', 'Sheen', 'who', 'visit', 'queen', 'Mirren', 'being', 'rather', 'nervous', 'new', 'job', 'country', 'been', 'off', 'balance', 'ever', 'Di', 'died', 'car', 'crash', 'few', 'weeks', 'ago', 'passing', 'royals', 'mixed', 'feelings', 'queen', 'decrees', 'Diana', 'divorced', 'Prince', 'Charles', 'was', 'no', 'longer', 'royal', 'arrangements', 'are', 'be', 'left', 'family.What', ""n't"", 'realize', 'people', 'ADORED', 'Diana', 'continue', 'adore', 'weeks', 'follow', 'Then', 'press', 'berating', 'royal', 'family', 'coldly', 'ignoring', 'ex-princess', 'heralding', 'Labour', 'Party', 'Blair', 'husband', 'mother', 'think', 'should', 'continue', 'doing', 'nothing', 'Queen', 'learned', 'people', 'need', 'be', 'appeased', 'Queen', 'slowly', 'old', 'book', 'Stephen', 'Frears', 'dignified', 'gloss', 'usually', 'older', 'movies', 'Scenes', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'maudlin', 'cliche', 'are', 'underplayed', 'more', 'powerful', 'One', 'example', 'queen', 'peering', 'Charles', 'young', 'sons', 'mother', 'died.Fortunately', 'real', 'life', 'also', 'comedy', 'as', 'well', 'confusion', 'tragedy', 'Peter', 'Morgan', 'humor', 'when', 'nervy', 'Blair', 'Queen', 'first', 'time', 'Morgan', 'also', 'u', 'kind', 'dialogue', 'can', 'imagine', 'droll', 'Elizabeth', 'prickly', 'Prince', 'Philip', 'saying', 'Sleeping', 'streets', 'pulling', 'out', 'hair', 'someone', 'never', 'knew', 'think', 'WE', ""'RE"", 'mad', '.Mirren', ""n't"", 'normally', 'look', 'much', 'Elizabeth', 'II', 'younger', 'taller', 'prettier', 'padding', 'makeup', 'BECOME', 'Elizabeth', 'II', 'dignified', 'haughty', 'yet', 'Mirren', 'bring', 'across', 'bewildered', 'vulnerable', 'as', 'well', 'short', 'version', 'Elizabeth', 'II', 'person.She', 'also', 'backed', 'magnificent', 'performances', 'Sheen', 'James', 'Cromwell', 'Cromwell', 'excellent', 'crotchety', 'stubborn', 'Prince', 'Philip', 'who', 'best', 'way', 'deal', 'grief', 'go', 'hunting', 'Sheen', 'very', 'good', 'Prime', 'Minister', 'who', 'just', 'starting', 'work', 'who', 'gains', 'new', 'perspective', 'royals', 'Queen', 'unique', 'quietly', 'compelling', 'film', 'what', 'might', 'have', 'happened', 'royal', 'family', 'person', 'Queen', 'Elizabeth', 'might', 'be', 'royal', 'mask']",The Queen
647571,A1RQQCPDN7ZCHU,B00005JPAM,"E.A. Week ""reviewer-at-large""","[6, 7]","While most civilians may grumble at the antics of their problematic kin, at least those personal dramas don't play out under an excruciating media microscope.  Anyone who has become a public figure--whether by choice or happenstance--isn't so lucky.  The Queen explores the tensions between public and private lives, with the clash between traditional decorum and popular celebrity culture forming much of the drama at the story's core.The film opens with Tony Blair (Michael Sheen), newly-elected prime minister of the UK, having his first awkward audience with Queen Elizabeth II (Helen Mirren).  She reminds him that he's her tenth Prime Minister--the first was Churchill--establishing the tenor of their uneasy relationship.  Her message couldn't be more clear: prime ministers may come and go, but the monarchy is forever.Fast-forward a few months to September, 1997.  Diana, the Princess of Wales, has just been killed in a Paris car crash, prompting an outpouring of grief among the nation's people.  Elizabeth and the other royals, ensconced at Balmoral, immediately close ranks.  Diana was no longer a member of their family, they maintain, and therefore her funeral should be a private matter, arranged by the Spencer clan.  Blair, meanwhile, has to deal with both the public's grief and their outrage at the royals' stony silence, while simultaneously trying to press Elizabeth into some kind of public gesture.The script by Peter Morgan, directed by Stephen Frears, deftly weaves the fictional narrative in with news footage from the week between Diana's death and her funeral.  The choices of archival material are outstanding, incorporated so perfectly into the script that the line between fiction and history blurs.  Morgan doesn't try to pretend that Diana was some kind of saint--it's pointed out that the woman the royal family knew and the ""people's princess"" were very different women--but neither does he vilify her memory, and the public's grief at Diana's death comes across palpably.  It's almost impossible not to be moved by the crowds of mourners and the vast sea of flowers piled up at the gates of Buckingham Palace.The engine that propels the narrative is the conflict between Elizabeth and Blair, with all their aides and servants circling around.  They couldn't be more different: she's elderly, austere, and regal; he's young, informal, and almost puppy-like in his exuberance.  Mirren and Sheen play off each other beautifully, and the constant friction between the two characters is a source of both humor and drama.  Their opposing viewpoints are presented pretty fairly: Elizabeth wants to keep things quiet and dignified, while the more modern Blair realizes that Diana's vast popularity has created extraordinary circumstances that traditional ""arrangements"" can't really cope with.The supporting players add much to the production.  Particularly good is Helen McCrory as Cherie Blair, her husband's compliment in every way--warm and funny, modern, sexy, and emotionally accessible.  The staff members in Blair's office are also terrific, lending a very West Wing flavor to the Blair administration; there's a running joke where one aide keeps bursting in to tell the PM how his approval rating is climbing in response to the crisis.  The characters' warm camaraderie leaves the viewer wanting more, always a good thing.The royals come across as one might expect: Prince Philip (James Cromwell) is a crusty boor, the most hard-line traditionalist, though some of his observations are spot-on and screamingly funny.  Prince Charles (Alex Jennings) is portrayed more or less sympathetically as a man caught between his domineering parents and his ex-wife's celebrity.  Sylvia Syms is great fun as the Queen Mother, providing much of the humor (her reaction when she realizes Diana's funeral will be based around plans for her own--because it's the only funeral that's been rehearsed--is just priceless).  Princes William and Harry are only glimpsed from behind, probably because they were still quite young at the time of their mother's death.  The bevy of servants and secretaries is excellent.Uniformly stellar performances really sell this movie.  Any number of superlatives has been heaped on Mirren for her performance, all of them deserved.  She rarely lets the queen's resolute self-control drop, but underneath the starchy surface, there's a lot of emotion going on, and Mirren lets the viewer see that with the subtlest gestures and expressions.  She does a marvelous job conveying Elizabeth's slow change of heart, her annoyance with Blair (and her ultimate respect for him), her concern for her grandsons, and her profound sense of duty to her country.  In perhaps her best scene, Elizabeth finally returns to London to make a public appearance; Mirren's expressions are fabulous as the queen takes in the mourners and the flowers, realizing viscerally the extent of people's grief.Mirren has a terrific foil in Sheen, who also hits every note perfectly as Blair, from the prime minister's awkwardness around the queen to his frustration with her and eventually his admiration for her when she addresses the people.  The two share a scene at the film's end where Elizabeth cautions Blair that one day the public will turn on him, unexpectedly, just as it turned on her, an open, honest exchange that perfectly bookends their initial meeting at the opening of the movie.The visuals are top-rate as well, bringing life and depth to the characters' worlds.  Balmoral looks like a big old hunting lodge--all wood and earth tones, stags' heads mounted on the walls--and the surrounding countryside is breathtaking in its rugged wildness.  The Blairs' home is warm and cluttered, covered with their children's artwork, and that cozy informality extends right into the prime minister's office.  The shots of the various characters in their sleepwear are both hilarious and poignant: Elizabeth wears a big fuzzy bathrobe, and Blair wears a sports jersey with his name on the back.  These intimate portraits really help sell the characters as flesh-and-blood people: the queen fumbling for her glasses in the middle of the night, the prime minister watching telly while munching down a bowl of cereal.  Ultimately it is these moments of humanity that make the film so enjoyable, the glimpses--even fictional--of the private lives behind the public faces, the inward and outward responses to tragedy and loss.The Queen isn't playing in wide distribution (yet), but it's well worth the time to seek out.

647572,AC1K4OQOZ90RS,B00005JPAM,"E. Bukowsky ""booklover10""","[5, 6]","Helen Mirren is at the center of Stephen Frears' ""The Queen,"" a fictionalized film based on real events that took place in 1997.  Mirren physically and psychologically inhabits the role of HRH Elizabeth II, a monarch who never sought the heavy responsibilities that came with the crown, but who, for more than four decades, performed her role with dignity.The film's main theme is the manner in which the royals reacted to the tragic death of Princess Diana.  Newly elected Prime Minister Tony Blair, a ""modernist,"" believed that Diana should be mourned publicly and that flags should be flown in royal residences at half-staff.  In addition, he urged Elizabeth to make some sort of public statement to the British people, who criticized the Queen for grieving privately on her estate in Scotland.  How shocked Elizabeth was when she learned that some members of the press and public blamed her for Diana's unhappiness and subsequent death!  In one scene, a bewildered Elizabeth murmurs, ""It's a bad dream.""  On another occasion, she expresses her chagrin at the turn events have taken:  ""There's been a change--a shift in values.""  She cannot understand why, for the first time, members of the royal family should be expected to show their feelings in public.Miss Mirren's stellar performance overshadows everyone else's in the cast, although James Cromwell is effective as a bombastic and insensitive Prince Philip and Michael Sheen does nice work as a callow Tony Blair who gradually grows into his new job as Prime Minister of England.  Although he is at first put off by Elizabeth's stiffness and formality, Blair later comes to admire her devotion to duty.  Alex Jennings, who does not physically resemble Prince Charles, plays the Prince as a compassionate man who, although he divorced Diana, still respected her devotion to William and Harry. Sylvia Syms plays the Queen Mum as a cartoonish matriarch who says whatever pops into her head.Frears uses archival footage of Diana and the hordes who paid tribute to her memory to bring back the emotionally charged atmosphere of those dark days.  The director contrasts these crowd scenes with the eerily remote and silent castle to which Elizabeth and her family retreat following the death of the ""People's Princess.""  Was Elizabeth truly as uncaring and cold as she appeared to many members of the press and public?  Did the royals mistreat Diana and somehow cause her to act recklessly?  There are no easy answers to these questions, nor does Frears take a clear position on these issues.  ""The Queen"" is worth seeing for its satirical and incisive look at a particular time in British history when a venerated institution, the British monarchy, came under fire after the royal family failed to meet a challenge that they never expected to face--to be the mourners-in-chief for a woman whom they personally disliked but who was cherished by the entire world.",5,"""What a family!""",1160352000,"10 9, 2006",2006,2916,"['Helen', 'Mirren', 'center', 'Stephen', 'Frears', 'Queen', 'fictionalized', 'film', 'based', 'real', 'events', 'took', 'place', '1997', 'Mirren', 'physically', 'psychologically', 'role', 'HRH', 'Elizabeth', 'II', 'monarch', 'who', 'never', 'sought', 'heavy', 'responsibilities', 'came', 'crown', 'who', 'more', 'four', 'decades', 'performed', 'role', 'dignity.The', 'film', 'main', 'theme', 'manner', 'royals', 'reacted', 'tragic', 'death', 'Princess', 'Diana', 'Newly', 'elected', 'Prime', 'Minister', 'Tony', 'Blair', 'modernist', 'believed', 'Diana', 'should', 'be', 'mourned', 'publicly', 'flags', 'should', 'be', 'flown', 'royal', 'residences', 'half-staff', 'addition', 'urged', 'Elizabeth', 'make', 'sort', 'public', 'statement', 'British', 'people', 'who', 'criticized', 'Queen', 'grieving', 'privately', 'estate', 'Scotland', 'How', 'shocked', 'Elizabeth', 'was', 'when', 'learned', 'members', 'press', 'public', 'blamed', 'Diana', 'unhappiness', 'subsequent', 'death', 'one', 'scene', 'bewildered', 'Elizabeth', 'murmurs', 'bad', 'dream', 'occasion', 'chagrin', 'turn', 'events', 'have', 'taken', 'been', 'change', 'shift', 'values', 'can', 'not', 'understand', 'why', 'first', 'time', 'members', 'royal', 'family', 'should', 'be', 'expected', 'show', 'feelings', 'public.Miss', 'Mirren', 'stellar', 'performance', 'everyone', 'else', 'cast', 'James', 'Cromwell', 'effective', 'bombastic', 'insensitive', 'Prince', 'Philip', 'Michael', 'Sheen', 'nice', 'work', 'callow', 'Tony', 'Blair', 'who', 'gradually', 'new', 'job', 'Prime', 'Minister', 'England', 'first', 'put', 'off', 'Elizabeth', 'stiffness', 'formality', 'Blair', 'later', 'admire', 'devotion', 'duty', 'Alex', 'Jennings', 'who', 'not', 'physically', 'resemble', 'Prince', 'Charles', 'Prince', 'compassionate', 'man', 'who', 'divorced', 'Diana', 'still', 'respected', 'devotion', 'William', 'Harry', 'Sylvia', 'Syms', 'Queen', 'Mum', 'cartoonish', 'matriarch', 'who', 'pops', 'head.Frears', 'archival', 'footage', 'Diana', 'hordes', 'who', 'paid', 'tribute', 'memory', 'bring', 'back', 'emotionally', 'charged', 'atmosphere', 'dark', 'days', 'director', 'crowd', 'scenes', 'eerily', 'remote', 'silent', 'castle', 'Elizabeth', 'family', 'retreat', 'following', 'death', 'People', 'Princess', 'Was', 'Elizabeth', 'truly', 'uncaring', 'cold', 'appeared', 'many', 'members', 'press', 'public', 'Did', 'royals', 'mistreat', 'Diana', 'somehow', 'cause', 'act', 'recklessly', 'are', 'easy', 'answers', 'questions', 'Frears', 'take', 'clear', 'position', 'issues', 'Queen', 'worth', 'seeing', 'satirical', 'incisive', 'look', 'particular', 'time', 'British', 'history', 'when', 'venerated', 'institution', 'British', 'monarchy', 'came', 'fire', 'royal', 'family', 'failed', 'meet', 'challenge', 'never', 'expected', 'face', 'be', 'mourners-in-chief', 'woman', 'whom', 'personally', 'disliked', 'who', 'was', 'cherished', 'entire', 'world']",The Queen
647573,A13E0ARAXI6KJW,B00005JPAM,Ed Uyeshima,"[2, 2]","It's reassuring to see an actress of Helen Mirren's caliber finally receiving the top-line recognition she deserves for a role that must have been challenging to tackle without sinking into parody as others before her have. As Queen Elizabeth II, she manages to convey the immaculate decorum of her real-life counterpart without sacrificing the humanism essential in empathizing with her during a trying time. The period in question is the week that felt like an eternity after the death of Princess Diana in 1997 when the world was awaiting an official response from the Queen. With just a wig and glasses to alter her appearance, Mirren is superb in a role that must have been quite constraining given that the subject is not only still the reigning monarch but the model of blank-faced self-possession. Written by Peter Morgan and directed by Stephen Frears in a surprisingly dishy manner, the film actually plays out as a witty comedy of manners beset by a tragic event.The 2006 film chronicles that momentous week and prefaces it with Tony Blair's first formal introduction to the Queen in May 1997 after his election as the first Labour Party Prime Minister in nearly two decades. Elizabeth's concerns over Blair's promises of modernity are expressed in small gestures, but obviously their values-based clash come to the fore when Diana is killed in a Paris car accident six months later. Cloistered at the time in their Scottish estate, Balmoral, the royal family does not support a public memorial for Diana since she had divorced Charles the previous year. However, public outcry over their seeming aloofness reaches a level of frenzy that places Blair in the difficult spot of requesting the Queen to speak to her subjects about what she considers a private matter. Exacerbating the situation is the residual animosity that the royal family feels toward Diana, whom they feel had betrayed them in the media.While the story is fact-based, one can't help but believe the private moments are played with a certain amount of exaggerated tabloid-friendly bias, especially the frequently cutting swipes at Diana and the rather fanciful episode with the stag. It makes for some of the film's more entertaining moments, but concurrently they undermine the credibility of the account. Beyond Mirren, there is superbly comic work from James Cromwell as a blustery, unsympathetic Prince Philip; Alex Jennings as a grieving but oddly vacant and paranoid Prince Charles; Helen McCrory as Blair's curtsey-challenged, tough-minded wife Cherie; and Sylvia Syms (not the jazz singer) as the still-alert, eye-rolling Queen Mother. Initially, Michael Sheen looks like he will do a zealous parody of the real Blair, but he gains respectable gravity as the story progresses. Above all else, the film is a personal triumph for Mirren's stellar work in what may turn out to be the role of a lifetime.",4,Surprisingly Dishy Account of a Momentous Week Anchored by Mirren's Superbly Etched Portrayal,1168128000,"01 7, 2007",2007,2887,"['reassuring', 'see', 'actress', 'Helen', 'Mirren', 'caliber', 'finally', 'receiving', 'top-line', 'recognition', 'role', 'must', 'have', 'been', 'challenging', 'tackle', 'sinking', 'parody', 'others', 'have', 'Queen', 'Elizabeth', 'II', 'convey', 'immaculate', 'decorum', 'real-life', 'counterpart', 'sacrificing', 'humanism', 'essential', 'empathizing', 'trying', 'time', 'period', 'question', 'week', 'felt', 'eternity', 'death', 'Princess', 'Diana', '1997', 'when', 'world', 'was', 'awaiting', 'official', 'response', 'Queen', 'just', 'wig', 'glasses', 'alter', 'appearance', 'Mirren', 'superb', 'role', 'must', 'have', 'been', 'quite', 'constraining', 'given', 'subject', 'not', 'only', 'still', 'reigning', 'monarch', 'model', 'blank-faced', 'self-possession', 'Written', 'Peter', 'Morgan', 'directed', 'Stephen', 'Frears', 'surprisingly', 'dishy', 'manner', 'film', 'actually', 'out', 'witty', 'comedy', 'manners', 'beset', 'tragic', 'event.The', '2006', 'film', 'chronicles', 'momentous', 'week', 'prefaces', 'Tony', 'Blair', 'first', 'formal', 'introduction', 'Queen', 'May', '1997', 'election', 'first', 'Labour', 'Party', 'Prime', 'Minister', 'nearly', 'two', 'decades', 'Elizabeth', 'concerns', 'Blair', 'promises', 'modernity', 'are', 'expressed', 'small', 'gestures', 'obviously', 'values-based', 'clash', 'come', 'fore', 'when', 'Diana', 'killed', 'Paris', 'car', 'accident', 'six', 'months', 'later', 'Cloistered', 'time', 'Scottish', 'estate', 'Balmoral', 'royal', 'family', 'not', 'support', 'public', 'memorial', 'Diana', 'had', 'divorced', 'Charles', 'previous', 'year', 'However', 'public', 'outcry', 'seeming', 'aloofness', 'level', 'frenzy', 'Blair', 'difficult', 'spot', 'requesting', 'Queen', 'speak', 'subjects', 'what', 'private', 'matter', 'Exacerbating', 'situation', 'residual', 'animosity', 'royal', 'family', 'feels', 'Diana', 'whom', 'feel', 'had', 'betrayed', 'media.While', 'story', 'fact-based', 'one', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'believe', 'private', 'moments', 'are', 'played', 'certain', 'amount', 'exaggerated', 'tabloid-friendly', 'bias', 'especially', 'frequently', 'cutting', 'swipes', 'Diana', 'rather', 'fanciful', 'episode', 'stag', 'film', 'more', 'entertaining', 'moments', 'concurrently', 'undermine', 'credibility', 'account', 'Beyond', 'Mirren', 'superbly', 'comic', 'work', 'James', 'Cromwell', 'blustery', 'unsympathetic', 'Prince', 'Philip', 'Alex', 'Jennings', 'grieving', 'oddly', 'vacant', 'paranoid', 'Prince', 'Charles', 'Helen', 'McCrory', 'Blair', 'curtsey-challenged', 'tough-minded', 'wife', 'Cherie', 'Sylvia', 'Syms', 'not', 'jazz', 'singer', 'still-alert', 'eye-rolling', 'Queen', 'Mother', 'Initially', 'Michael', 'Sheen', 'will', 'do', 'zealous', 'parody', 'real', 'Blair', 'gains', 'respectable', 'gravity', 'story', 'else', 'film', 'personal', 'triumph', 'Mirren', 'stellar', 'work', 'what', 'may', 'turn', 'out', 'be', 'role', 'lifetime']",The Queen
647574,AY1HVIM2V067E,B00005JPAM,"Edward G. Nilges ""Author, 'Build Your Own .Ne...","[2, 4]","Saw the film in the theaters, bought the (pricey) DVD when it came out. That's because this film is especially well-crafted by all the participants.Helen Mirren goes as an actress all the way down into her body to come up with perfect pitch.Jim Cromwell as Prince Phillip understands perfectly what a rotter, and how utterly damaged as a human being, Prince Phillip is. Chap who plays his son has the tension in the family, and the POW's inability to break through the ""enchanted glass"" of a family romance, upon which rests such a weight of memory, down pat.The phrase ""The Enchanted Glass"" is from an excellent book by Tom Nairn about the subconscious of monarchy, and the way that Britain is more or less stuck with it absent a disaster such as happened to the Hapsburgs.Mirren and Cromwell document the passing of an era dominated by the unadmittedly fearful shadow of what had happened to Britain and Britons in WWII and the long years after of rationing and the end of Empire.The film documents a moment of hope which was reversed when Britain realized that its financial markets, and hence its foreign policy, were in thrall to the USA and went roaring in the old style into Iraq.To its credit the film does not document a transformation in Elizabeth so much as a moment of greatness when the ""real"" Queen realized the truth of Charles de Gaulles' advice to her when young, and this was to realize that she was in for a life sentence, and thereby to understand that a Constitutional monarch's lot is not a happy one. She had to represent the gay men and the fat chaps sleeping on the streets, she had, in a minor key, to imitate Emperor Hirohito when he got on the radio to say that ""Japan must endure the unendurable and suffer the insufferable"" in 1945.She had to surrender to time and change, and a Britain no longer in thrall to the posh alone.She realizes how dismayed her father was when his own elder brother bugged out in 1937 and how the stresses of being George VI may have killed her Dad, who smoked himself to death.The film is an elegant lesson in the meaning of the unwritten British constitution, right down to the strange way in which hierarchies parallel each other, with Blair's men meeting with court flunkeys who spend two hours arguing the merits of a gun carriage as an hearse for a Princess no longer, don't y'know, a Princess.What we need next is a film treatment of the Princess who here appears only as herself in film clips, but Parliament needs to pass a law that a certain Madonna Ciccione from the USA is not to be allowed anywhere near the casting couch for that role: I say this because that woman, who is talented in certain regards but not in others, destroyed filmdom's chances to bring Evita Peron to life on the silver screen. Elton John in drag, or any number of gay chaps, would do a better job as Princess Diana in the same way boys played Cleopatra in Shakespeare's day.This treatment may start up as a Broadway and West End musical but if you ask me, only first-rate actors and writers should be allowed anywhere near this subject. The tastefulness of The Queen shows what happens below blockbuster level where the makers of the film aren't bullyragged as they are in movies aimed at 14 year olds.A xenophile can see a ""foreign"" film (although British films are not really all that ""foreign"" to Americans save self-moronized Texans) and get all patriotic for the wrong country: this happens to the sensitive chap in watching the Gance Napoleon. I can only hazard that this film will manufacture consent to the (relatively) harmless, if rather pricey, institution of the Monarch, although it gives some time, but short shrift, to Cherie Blair's Jacobite sympathies.The moral is don't fix it if it isn't broke, and the adventure of Iraq demonstrates that flawed institutions should never be replaced unless absolutely necessary.",5,"Superb.

(And I do not restrict this feeling to British film.)-The performances here are so dazzling that one forgets that in the film, Diana, her brother, and several others ""play"" themselves thanks to the stunning genius of Stephen Frears.-The soundtrack by Andre Desplat, which I have reviewed, is haunting and superior to most soundtracks I've heard in my life.-Helen Mirren does a frighteningly wonderful job portraying Her Majesty. I was in total commiseration with her throughout the entire film. It was PM Blair who sort of angered me. Lucky they took so many liberties with the truth (which we shall never know in full).-Before hitting Sylvia Sims too harshly for her portrayal of the Queen Mother, bear in mind Frears had begged Joan Plowright to take the role. I think Plowright was too busy filming some crappy film. What a difference it would have made, but Sims does her job!-The scenes at what is supposed to be Balmoral are airy and beautiful.

647577,A31T5ANGT3NCDR,B00005JPAM,elena maria vidal,"[2, 4]","""The Queen"" (2006) starring Helen Mirren as Queen Elizabeth II has got to be one of the most realistic and revealing portrayals ever of any monarch on film. Mirren effortlessly becomes Elizabeth; the few stirring weeks captured in the film tell the viewer much about the entire life of the queen as well as the nature of monarchy. Too often filmmakers, particularly those from Hollywood, project the misconception that being a royal means getting to have everything you want and ordering people around in a haphazard manner. In ""The Queen,"" Her Majesty is portrayed as addressing everyone, especially her domestic staff, with exquisite courtesy and consideration. From what I have read about the private lives of the various royal families such behavior on the part of a sovereign is much closer to the reality than any crass barking of orders. This is not to mitigate moral shortcomings; I am referring only to surface behavior, which nevertheless can and does indicate one's general attitude towards others. Elizabeth II comes across as first and foremost a servant of her people.The film opens with the Queen having her portrait painted, sending the message that the story one is about to see is a portrait come to life. And indeed it is. It is also the portrait of monarchy in the modern world. Tradition is confronted with waves of constant change; some concessions must be made in order to survive. The scenes of the royal family ""at home"" almost reminded me of Louis XVI and Marie-Antoinette at the Tuileries--living in a gilded cage with no actual freedom or power. And yet Mirren subtly and dynamically captures the personality of the quiet little woman who embodies an ancient institution which only her presence and her dignity can salvage. What is especially fascinating is how the queen wins over socialist Tony Blair; he becomes her champion and the savior of the monarchy. It called to mind how dedicated revolutionaries like Mirabeau and Barnave were deeply moved after meeting Marie-Antoinette and wanted to do everything they could to help her.What is especially compelling about ""The Queen"" is that it involves events which many people today have lived through, with the main characters being a reigning sovereign and a sitting prime minister. It evoked memories of the day Princess Diana died. I thought people were being a bit harsh on the queen even then and I saw nothing wrong with the royal family staying at Balmoral to grieve in private, although to everyone else in the world it was a major calamity. Queen Elizabeth's devotion to duty and her dedication to the vow she made to serve her people are shown in sharp contrast to Diana's futile and tragic quest for personal happiness.I am always annoyed when people compare Diana to Marie-Antoinette, calling the Queen of France a ""Lady Di before her time."" Yes, they both loved children, fashion, and had many charities. But when her world fell apart, Marie-Antoinette steadfastly stayed at her husband's side, although everything in her wanted to get her family away from danger. But Louis would not leave his people and Marie-Antoinette would not leave her husband, although she had many opportunities to escape. Diana had very different ideas about duty and marriage. Marie-Antoinette would not leave; Diana did. I do not condemn Diana; she had a lot with which to contend. Queen Elizabeth II, however, is of the old school, when duty, honor, discretion and commitment came before the pursuit of happiness.",5,Portrait of a Queen,1180828800,"06 3, 2007",2007,3485,"['Queen', '2006', 'starring', 'Helen', 'Mirren', 'Queen', 'Elizabeth', 'II', 'got', 'be', 'one', 'most', 'realistic', 'revealing', 'portrayals', 'ever', 'monarch', 'film', 'Mirren', 'effortlessly', 'Elizabeth', 'few', 'stirring', 'weeks', 'captured', 'film', 'tell', 'viewer', 'much', 'entire', 'life', 'queen', 'as', 'well', 'nature', 'monarchy', 'Too', 'often', 'particularly', 'Hollywood', 'project', 'misconception', 'being', 'royal', 'getting', 'have', 'everything', 'want', 'ordering', 'people', 'haphazard', 'manner', 'Queen', 'Majesty', 'portrayed', 'addressing', 'everyone', 'especially', 'domestic', 'staff', 'exquisite', 'courtesy', 'consideration', 'what', 'have', 'read', 'private', 'lives', 'various', 'royal', 'families', 'such', 'behavior', 'part', 'sovereign', 'much', 'closer', 'reality', 'crass', 'barking', 'orders', 'not', 'mitigate', 'moral', 'shortcomings', 'am', 'referring', 'only', 'surface', 'behavior', 'nevertheless', 'can', 'indicate', 'one', 'general', 'attitude', 'others', 'Elizabeth', 'II', 'first', 'foremost', 'servant', 'people.The', 'film', 'Queen', 'having', 'portrait', 'painted', 'sending', 'message', 'story', 'one', 'see', 'portrait', 'come', 'life', 'indeed', 'also', 'portrait', 'monarchy', 'modern', 'world', 'Tradition', 'confronted', 'waves', 'constant', 'change', 'concessions', 'must', 'be', 'made', 'order', 'survive', 'scenes', 'royal', 'family', 'home', 'almost', 'reminded', 'Louis', 'XVI', 'Marie-Antoinette', 'Tuileries', 'living', 'gilded', 'cage', 'actual', 'freedom', 'power', 'yet', 'Mirren', 'subtly', 'dynamically', 'personality', 'quiet', 'little', 'woman', 'who', 'ancient', 'institution', 'only', 'presence', 'dignity', 'can', 'salvage', 'What', 'especially', 'fascinating', 'how', 'queen', 'wins', 'socialist', 'Tony', 'Blair', 'champion', 'savior', 'monarchy', 'called', 'mind', 'how', 'dedicated', 'revolutionaries', 'Mirabeau', 'Barnave', 'were', 'deeply', 'moved', 'meeting', 'Marie-Antoinette', 'wanted', 'do', 'everything', 'could', 'help', 'her.What', 'especially', 'compelling', 'Queen', 'events', 'many', 'people', 'today', 'have', 'lived', 'main', 'characters', 'being', 'reigning', 'sovereign', 'sitting', 'prime', 'minister', 'evoked', 'memories', 'day', 'Princess', 'Diana', 'died', 'thought', 'people', 'were', 'being', 'bit', 'harsh', 'queen', 'even', 'then', 'saw', 'nothing', 'wrong', 'royal', 'family', 'staying', 'Balmoral', 'grieve', 'private', 'everyone', 'else', 'world', 'was', 'major', 'calamity', 'Queen', 'Elizabeth', 'devotion', 'duty', 'dedication', 'vow', 'made', 'serve', 'people', 'are', 'shown', 'sharp', 'contrast', 'Diana', 'futile', 'tragic', 'quest', 'personal', 'happiness.I', 'am', 'always', 'annoyed', 'when', 'people', 'compare', 'Diana', 'Marie-Antoinette', 'calling', 'Queen', 'France', 'Lady', 'Di', 'time', 'Yes', 'loved', 'children', 'fashion', 'had', 'many', 'charities', 'when', 'world', 'fell', 'apart', 'Marie-Antoinette', 'steadfastly', 'stayed', 'husband', 'side', 'everything', 'wanted', 'get', 'family', 'away', 'danger', 'Louis', 'would', 'not', 'leave', 'people', 'Marie-Antoinette', 'would', 'not', 'leave', 'husband', 'had', 'many', 'opportunities', 'escape', 'Diana', 'had', 'very', 'different', 'ideas', 'duty', 'marriage', 'Marie-Antoinette', 'would', 'not', 'leave', 'Diana', 'did', 'do', 'not', 'condemn', 'Diana', 'had', 'lot', 'contend', 'Queen', 'Elizabeth', 'II', 'however', 'old', 'school', 'when', 'duty', 'honor', 'discretion', 'commitment', 'came', 'pursuit', 'happiness']",The Queen

647580,A1EQ5D5JRSW23K,B00005JPAM,Erol Esen,"[1, 1]","I just finished watching The Queen; starring Helen Mirren, who won this year's Oscar, and a powerful cast of stars who support the story of a week in the life of the Queen of England right after p. Diana's passing away in a car accident.The movie shows a rare glimpse into the private lives of the Royal Family of Great Britain. A human angle, if you will. Sitting together in a family room, which looks like a family room in a typical middle class house. But logical in its dimensions as humans can comfortably sit in a room and watch TV. What's extraordinary is that they are watching themselves and grumbling about it.James Cromwell, an American actor, does an excellent job adding flesh, blood, and a loud voice to an otherwise vertical shadow that is the Duke of Edinburgh, the Queen's husband, who is apparently a greater influence than one might think of a shadow.Michael Sheen superbly depicts Tony Blair--a favorite communicator on par with Bill Clinton or Ronald Reagan.So the movie essentially says the Queen and her family are humans and they made a mistake. But what's important is how this mistake is characterized and why it needed to be rectified. The mistake was that the Queen failed to understand and empathize with her people: her job. It needed to be rectified because of fear that the English monarchy maybe abolished (the film quotes Blair to have said one fourth of that country wants it that way). The fear itself stems likely from the fear of no income to maintain a lifestyle befitting royalty.I was once told that the reason English people tolerate the monarchy is because they bring in more money into the UK than they take out. It is, in essence, a marketing tool for the island nation. Perhaps with the Queen this is true. I have a hard time believing it will continue to be so after her. Their 40,000-acre backyard might bring in more income. I also read somewhere p.

So much so that royal history, burgeoning with fiendish conspiracies, violent plots, and gruesome assassinations, sometimes reads like a slasher novel. A few recent films have fully exploited this theme. 1998's ""Elizabeth"", starring the should-have-won-an-Oscar-for-this-role Cate Blanchett as Elizabeth I, revolved around an assassination attempt that included the queen's lover. On a less violent theme, Judy Dench, in ""Mrs. Brown"", depicted Queen Victoria's ""trist"" with a Highlander that had all of England alight with scandal. Has a new ""threatened queen"" genre emerged? Apparently so. Enter a rare film about a living monarch who finds her crown imperiled in an astonishingly novel way. For once Her Majesty can watch the drama she lived reemerge in celluloid - not that she probably wants to. Though the film sports a prosaic title, ""The Queen"", it boldly explores uncharted territory. Here the Queen, reigning in the late twentieth century hinterland between monarchy and non-monarchy, finds herself attacked by her own people. And she, much like the great-great-grandmother she shares with her husband, was not amused.The film opens as Queen Elizabeth II sits for a regal portrait. Her world unfolds as the royal portraiteer dotes on his imperial subject. Then, in a ""we're not in Kansas anymore"" flash, the newly elected Tony Blair explodes onto the screen. The now ex-Prime Minister receives voluminous coverage for a movie entited ""The Queen."" One memorable early scene shows Blair bowing on one knee as the Queen inquires as to his desire to serve the nation. He answers ""yes."" That probably didn't give too much away. Both figures, Sovereign and Prime Minister, share the spotlight and their disparate worlds collide after catastrophe strikes.News of Princess Diana's death soars over England. Actual news footage, now almost ten years old, gets woven with dramatization. The late Princess appears often. Tony Blair issues a eulogy almost immediately. But the royal family remains eerily silent, holed up in Balmoral, their Scottish getaway. The Duke of Edinburgh, depicted here as rather heartless and crass, shows more concern for hunting stags than the furor around the dead Princess. He even takes Diana's sons hunting as a diversion. Prince Charles, divorced for a year from Diana, remains the only one moved. He flies to France to bring the body of his ex-wife back to England. As the tension rises the film depicts him as nervous, fidgety, and fearing assassination. Regardless, he cannot alter his mother's public stoicism towards the tragedy. The Queen Mother provides some comic relief. When someone shows concern over photographers intruding on their son's hunt, she says nonchalantly, ""if there's a photographer he could be the first kill of the day.""Soon bundles of flowers and messages of grief crowd the gate of Buckingham Palace. But no one's home. The flag, supporting royal traditon, remains lowered in the Queen's absence. Icy silence from the palace sours the public. They begin speaking out against the monarchy. This causes a drastic change in Tony Blair. He suddenly sees the interdependence of the Queen with his own station. In phone call after phone call he pleads with her to do something. She resists even after he gives her a vital statistic: one in four people now favor abolishing the monarchy. Que the Threatened Queen leitmotif. Princess Diana now seems to upstage the royal family even in death. Elizabeth II convinces herself that ""this mood"" will pass.It doesn't. Slowly the idea that her people hate her sinks in. Bowing to pressure, the family inspects the bundles of grief displayed outside of Balmoral. They soon return to London and face the dense Buckingham crowds. Here the Queen sees what her public indifference has wrought. She reads ""They don't deserve you"" and ""They have your blood on their hands"" on some of the flowers. Here begins the Queen's transformation, criss-crossing with the Prime Minister's. Diana's death irreversably changes them both. Finally, probably more in deference to her public than to the dead Princess, the Queen finally issues a public statement. Blair's staff has the original text rewritten ""to make it appear like a human being wrote it."" But at this point Blair, who earlier said ""someone save these people from themselves"", now lashes out in defense as his aide mocks the Queen's sincerity. The fuse begins to fizzle.The film explodes a haunting paradox. Royal tradition, often seen as the bulwark of the monarchy, here threatens to undermine the institution itself. Insisting on not raising Buckingham's flag to honor Diana and treating the tragedy as ""a private matter"" enfuriates the public. Stuff tradition. They demand a change of protocol. Subsequently, Britain turned upside down.Of course a film depicting living breathing people fumbling through a crisis will inevitably draw controversy. Blair gets depicted as savior here, the steam in the engine. But the real Elizabeth II issued a statement that she decided to speak out all by herself. In her own words no one persuaded her actions. Not only that, Blair and the Queen have supposedly never divulged what passed between them during that tense week. Given that, this film presents an educated guess as to the workings of the English government during that time. One wonders what Tony Blair and the Queen really think of the film. One also wonders if the royal family and the Prime Minister really watch that much television.The performances throughout remain stunning. Helen Mirren and Micheal Sheen shine as the protagonists/antagonists. Mirren's performance dazzles so much that viewers will forget that they're watching Helen Mirren. She presents an example of undetectable acting at its finest. And though no intense action takes place the film still provides a roller coaster ride. The actors and the direction by Stephen Frears, just off of ""Mrs. Henderson Presents"", obviously deserve credit here.Best of all, ""The Queen"" allows viewers to come to their own conclusions surrounding that controversial week in 1997. Was the public right in lashing out at the monarchy? Was the Queen sincere in her famous ""grandmother"" speech? Was the monarchy really threatened? The film depicts the events without mashing opinions and answers in viewers' faces. Audiences can leave with vastly differing viewpoints. And what's better than great film? Having great conversations about great film. ""The Queen"" will doubtless keep tongues happily waggling for some time to come.",5,The latest threat to the crown dramatized...,1161043200,"10 17, 2006",2006,6574,"['Monarchs', 'have', 'always',

647587,ACIBQ6BQ6AWEV,B00005JPAM,"Gary F. Taylor ""GFT""","[1, 2]","At an early point in THE QUEEN, Prince Charles comments that the Princess Diana known to the royal family and the Princess Diana known to the people are two entirely different entities.  It is an astute observation, and much the same might be said of Queen Elizabeth II herself, a woman who has spent most of her life upholding the dignities, responsibilities, and duties of the crown regardless of her personal sentiments--and who has worked remarkably hard to keep those sentiments out of the public eye.THE QUEEN focuses on the week following Princess Diana's fatal car crash, and Princess Diana's presence broods over the film in the form of actual news footage.  But THE QUEEN focuses on Elizabeth, and as presented here she is a woman whose life has been dominated by the discipline required of her office.  She has authority, wealth, and priviledge of such degree that it is far, far beyond the scope of all but handful to imagine, much less understand.  At the same time, however, she is a prisoner in a gilded cage; few moments are hers alone, and only her iron-clad will upholds her in the face of the demands of her office.It not therefore surprising that upon Diana's death Elizabeth instantly sets aside her own emotions and moves forward inside the code of conduct that has dominated her entire life.  Even her concerns for her grandsons must take second place to the demands of her office, and in this instance she determines that the office demands the same stability she has always offered to her people: a calm and unruffled visage and adherence to the meticulous protocol that has shaped her entire life.  This proves a great miscalculation.  The public, enamored of Diana, interprets this as indicative of royal indifference.Very little can be said of Helen Mirren's performance as Queen Elizabeth II which has not already been said.  It is brilliant and quite possibly unequalled in its recreation and interpretation of such a well-known and still-living figure.  It is perfectly balanced by Michael Sheen in the role of Prime Minister Tony Blair, whose habitual informality offers a perfect counter-balance, and the remarkable efforts of those cast as the royals: James Cromwell, Sylvia Syms, Alex Jennings, and Helen McCrory, who play Prince Philip, The Queen Mother, Prince Charles, and Cherie Blair respectively.  The tone of the film is cool, graceful, elegant, and indeed stately--and although this might have emerged as dull in other hands, it builds to a remarkable climax in the hands of Stephen Frears.The one occasionally questionable note is the script by Peter Morgan.  In one sense, it is remarkably resourceful, managing to include considerable detail; in another, however, it is extremely obvious.  I was occasionally troubled by the thought that, had it not been fueled by the miraculous performances of the cast, it would have drifted into triteness.  This is particularly the case in terms of character shifts, which occasionally seem unexpected and which occasionally go nowhere in particular.It would be interesting to know what the royals and the Blairs think of the film.  At present there has been--in typical Buckingham Palace style--little or no comment.  The Queen herself has only noted that, given that it focuses upon a particularly painful time, she has no desire to see it.  In terms of quality, the DVD is quite good without being dazzling.  Bonuses include a short and generally interesting, if not particularly deep, ""making of"" documentary and two audio commentaries: one by director Stephen Frears and writer Peter Morgan, which is good, and one by royal expert Robert Lacey, which is better still.

It was her subject's dismay and disapproval of the queen's ice-cool manner that is supposed to express dignity and fortitude in the face of extremis that had to change.  In our present touchy-feely age  where anything goes and public displays of emotion encouraged, this kind of stoicism is becoming increasingly misunderstood by later generations of H.M.'s subjects.  All this excessive formality had to go - or at least bring us some blessed relief from it all!  However, lessons have been learned, scars are healing and the queen has recovered her undoubted popularity here in Great Britain.  I think that Her Majesty The Queen is a woman that her subjects have always admired and respected, if not loved - until now maybe.  One has to remember that this is a movie and not a documentary.

But after reading Tina Brown's Chronicles of Diana and YES I know its' a rehash of what we all ""know"" of those years and that particular soap opera, but the last chapters of the book after Diana's death, are fascinating in that they are the same time period shown in ""the Queen"". According to people who were there, servants, officials and the like, the emotional sense of how the family reacted toward the young princes, William and Harry, has none of the coldness and emotional ""lets just get on with life"" attitude implied in the film and in the review, top, which says ""Prince Phillip clumsily tried to help by taking the boys hunting."" (paraphrased).  Well, these boys had spent their summer vacations riding and hunting at Balmoral all their lives, and this is what they thoroughly enjoyed. It wasn't something their stuffy old grandfather forced them to do. The book describes the entire Royal family rallying around the boys---Princess Anne, Charles' sister, brought her 20 yr old son and 16 yr old daughter, to help entertain their cousins, and she herself made a project of taking the very emotionally fragile Harry under her wing, and taking him riding and hiking out in the Balmoral hills alone. Charles pulled out family albums and spent time going over the past good times the family had had. Prince Phillip their grandfather, in particular, was very protective, showed ""gruff tenderness"" and did make sure they hunted,rode and kept active, as opposed to brooding and staying glued to the maudlin TV coverage. Actually, for the benefit of the boys, the Queen ordered all TVs and radios removed in the castle.  The outdoors life is one the family is used to and enjoys. Those who criticised the Royals for having the boys there in Balmoral instead of exposing them to the hysterical crowds in London...well, I don't know which would give them more nightmares in years to come but I can guess.  Also, other little tidbits in the book of that week were once when Prince Phillip came on the intercom when the decisions about the State funeral were being made and broke in, shouting, ""those boys have just lost their mother...they are not a commodity..."" Brown, the author quotes her source as saying ""you could hear the voice of a real grandfather."" Later, it was Prince Phillip, not Charles who talked the princes into walking in the moving spectacle of the royal men behind the cortege. He told the sobbing William, ""If I walk, will you walk with me?"" And during the long walk to the Cathedral, spoke quietly to the two boys of the famous sights they were passing, speaking softly the whole way there. All these vignettes, which would have made all the Royal more human, were left out of the film, good as it was, there was an agenda, that doesn't have to be spelled out.  The Queen could admire a royal appearing stag, later shown beheaded...but her love and her husband's love for the grandsons was never shown, nor was the love of the whole family for the boys or for each other, despite all Diana had done to blacken the reputation of that family in the press.

Stephen Frears's style is very matte, no gloss, which was the right medium to depict the restrained, modestly upright lifestyle of the royals.  You can't help but feel the stark difference between their demeanor and that of their subjects.  This is exacerbated by both side's reaction to the death of Lady Di.  The royals desired a private burial for Diana whereas the nation wished for a public one since she was considered the ""People's Princess"".  Throughout the movie you find yourself trying to identify with points of view and then figuring out which side was truly right to begin with.  Of course, none of this is resolved on screen, but the resulting events are well played out in a sort of denoument of compromise.While Helen Mirren was spot on playing Queen Elizabeth, I felt Michael Sheen was also deserving of an Oscar for his portrayal of Tony Blair, handling his first official crisis after just stepping in office (ironically foreshadowing a real-life future one much larger than this).  Tony Blair, much like the audience, is caught somewhere in the middle, trying to understand both sides and come up with a resolution that allows both to save face.This is definitely a worthwhile movie, but for those who prefer something a little more action packed, I'd advise you to skip this.",4,Pleasantly Humdrum,1184889600,"07 20, 2007",2007,1359,"['admire', 'what', 'filmakers', 'attempted', 'do', 'movie', 'Stephen', 'Frears', 'style', 'very', 'matte', 'gloss', 'was', 'right', 'medium', 'depict', 'restrained', 'modestly', 'upright', 'lifestyle', 'royals', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'feel', 'stark', 'difference', 'demeanor', 'subjects', 'exacerbated', 'side', 'reaction', 'death', 'Lady', 'Di', 'royals', 'desired', 'private', 'burial', 'Diana', 'whereas', 'nation', 'wished', 'public', 'one', 'was', 'considered', 'People', 'Princess', 'movie', 'find', 'trying', 'identify', 'points', 'view', 'then', 'figuring', 'out', 'side', 'was', 'truly', 'right', 'begin', 'course', 'none', 'resolved', 'screen', 'resulting', 'events', 'are', 'well', 'played', 'out', 'sort', 'denoument', 'compromise.While', 'Helen', 'Mirren', 'was', 'spot', 'playing', 'Queen', 'Elizabeth', 'felt', 'Michael', 'Sheen', 'was', 'also', 'deserving', 'Oscar', 'portrayal', 'Tony', 'Blair', 'handling', 'first', 'official', 'crisis', 'just', 'stepping', 'office', 'ironically', 'foreshadowing', 'real-life', 'future', 'one', 'much', 'larger', 'Tony', 'Blair', 'much', 'audience', 'caught', 'somewhere', 'middle', 'trying', 'understand', 'sides', 'come', 'up', 'resolution', 'save', 'face.This', 'definitely', 'worthwhile', 'movie', 'who', 'prefer', 'something', 'little', 'more', 'action', 'packed', ""'d"", 'advise', 'skip']",The Queen
647593,A3T01DMFNYQ2A9,B00005JPAM,G. J. Weeks,"[2, 2]","I really enjoyed this film and found it better than I expected. Everyone knows Mirren was superb, but Sheen had Blair's voice to perfection and I thought all the actors did well, particularly the unsung heroes, four corgis of Her Majesty. Other reviews set the scene of unresponsive, out of touch queen versus the people's new prime minister. But I did not find this to be an anti-monarchist film at all. Blair is an instant convert to royalism it seems and the film faithfully portrays why the Queen behaved as she did. One does what one perceives to be one's duty and does not wear one's heart on one's sleeve. I confess all my sympathies were with the Queen in her distance from the gushing emotion and pseudo-grief of Joe Public. I think the story about the stag was to show the Queen had more feeling for dumb animals than a dead princess, but then the stag had not given her any distress in the past. I think the message portrayed was that it was not merely that the Queen did not show the emotion of grief over Diana but that she was not really feeling her loss, apart from her concern for the two boys. Of course one knows that a lot of what was portrayed here is mere speculation but the one historic thing I question is the congregation in Westminster Abbey applauding Althrop's speech. Did they? If so I must at the time have been so disgusted by his speech that I missed the applause. Thankfully the parts of his speech in which he criticized the royal family were left out. Message of the film.? The monarchy must modernise.

647594,A328S9RN3U5M68,B00005JPAM,Grady Harp,"[3, 5]","THE QUEEN seems like one of those biographical features that would be difficult to hold anyone's interest - on the surface, without the benefit of knowing much about the content.  Queen Elizabeth II is not exactly a figure who generates anything but a response of boredom, so flat and uninteresting is her persona.  But enter Helen Mirren, one of the finest actresses on the screen today, and this potentially boring potentate becomes a vibrantly detailed and fascinating portrait of a queen at odds with the times.  It is a staggering achievement.Director Stephen Frears, using a superb script by Peter Morgan, details the time from the election of Labor Party Prime Minister Tony Blair (a brilliant Michael Sheen) to that momentous international outpouring of grief and love that followed the tragic death of Princess Di in 1997, showing the bifurcation of response between the Royals and the People as represented by Blair.  Instead of the insensitive cold figure that the world witnessed as QE II, Mirren shows us that the woman who is Queen actually had feelings for her grandchildren, a respect for her station as royalty,  and was gradually responsive to the cry of the people via Blair's influence, allowing the world to pay proper tribute to a heroine.  The ogres in the Balmoral Castle were in fact Prince Phillip (James Cromwell) and the Queen Mum (Sylvia Syms) abetted by the very proper Robin Janvrin (Roger Allam) and the wishy washy Prince Charles (Alex Jennings).The entire production is beautifully filmed with the use of clips from Princess Di's life (and death) instead of creating an actress role to portray her - a very wise choice.  The musical score by Alexandre Desplat is superb (with a little help from Verdi's 'Libera Me' as sung by Lynn Dawson and the BBC chorus for the funeral portion).  But indeed the accolades go to Helen Mirren in an Oscar worthy performance - with the very strong counterbalance by Michael Sheen.  An excellent film about a moment no one will ever forget.

Most of the film has to do with the week or so after the untimely death of Princess Diana and the royal family's reaction to it and their totally misjudging the public's reaction. Queen Elizabeth and Prince Philip, because of their icy stoicism and, more importantly, their total distaste for the princess, were all set to stay at Balmoral, ignore the press, make no public statement, have a small private funeral and let Prince Philip take Princess Diana's sons hunting to divert them from their sorrow. The royal couple, as the whole world now knows, got their comeuppance, and at the eleventh hour, managed to do the right thing but not without the help of a very determined Tony Blair.The acting is excellent with only the Queen Mother being miscast. Dame Helen Mirren convinces you she is the queen; both Prince Philip and Prince Charles are believable; and Michael Sheen gives an outstanding performance as Prime Minister Tony Blair (""Just call me 'Tony'""). The movie belongs just as much to the prime minister as to the queen. There is a scene near the end of the film when Blair has an audience with Queen Elizabeth and she reminds him of the fickleness of the public. We are reminded, rather sadly, that he bought into a war that ultimately cost him his position.Although Fears of course covers the death and funeral of Princess Diana (""the people's Princess""), he does it with grace and respect and never  exploits the sad events. For example, her sons never speak nor are seen closeup. Additionally the actual footage of events at the time is so well integrated with the rest of the movie so that the two are indistinguishable, no small feat on the part of both the director and cinemaphotographer.The critics are already talking about an Oscar nomination for Mirren.

In retrospect, the massive mourning over Diana seems excessive and silly. The Queen's initial reaction of having a private funeral was the right choice but the crowds were insane - making much more of Diana than she deserved. In my opinion, the Queen was not out of touch - the British people were - so dazed by a foolish celebrity culture that they were no longer rational. Yes, Prince Philip comes off as stupid - most of the Royal family are. The Queen, however, has conducted herself with a great sense of duty and faithfulness to her people.

It is not a comedy really, but a very witty take on a crisis.The film concentrates on the role of the queen during a tragic event. Some of the people surrounding her, like Prince Charles and Tony Blair catch on immediately that this crisis calls for action from the royals. However, the film makes it clear that the queen's reaction is colourde by her past: she experienced the crisis during her uncle's abdication - which lead to her own father's early death - and the horrors of the second world first hand. She could not understand the effect of the death of one royal on a public cushioned by a long time of relative peace and prosperity. However, she shows her strength by stepping down and acknowledging the grief of her people.Prince Philip is mercilessly parodied as living in his own private reality which only momentarily toches our own reality! However, the film also delivers some kicks to both Cherie Blair and Alasdair Campbell as they are portrayed as extremely arrogant and self-righteous, and in a way are as separated from the common man as Prince Philip.The also hints at one more reason why the queen hesitated to assume leadership of the grieving masses: she also experienced the 1930s, and had a terrible fear of what could happen in times of mass-hysteria. She did not wan any part of that! She sees the role of the monarch as being a pillar of stability in a chaotic world.The film offers no clear judgement of the actions of the queen, but it gives an explanation for her actions, and a possible understanding.The film can also be seen as a comment on Tony Blair, as he himself got caugh in a swirl of hysteria and involved himself in the very questionable invasion of Iraq.",5,"The old ideas are not always wrong, even if they appear so",1186876800,"08 12, 2007",2007,1786,"['film', 'elegant', 'clever', 'interesting', 'profound', 'incredibly', 'funny', 'not', 'comedy', 'really', 'very', 'witty', 'take', 'crisis.The', 'film', 'concentrates', 'role', 'queen', 'tragic', 'event', 'people', 'surrounding', 'Prince', 'Charles', 'Tony', 'Blair', 'catch', 'immediately', 'crisis', 'action', 'royals', 'However', 'film', 'clear', 'queen', 'reaction', 'colourde', 'past', 'experienced', 'crisis', 'uncle', 'abdication', 'lead', 'own', 'father', 'early', 'death', 'horrors', 'second', 'world', 'first', 'hand', 'could', 'not', 'understand', 'effect', 'death', 'one', 'royal', 'public', 'cushioned', 'long', 'time', 'relative', 'peace', 'prosperity', 'However', 'strength', 'stepping', 'down', 'acknowledging', 'grief', 'people.Prince', 'Philip', 'mercilessly', 'parodied', 'living', 'own', 'private', 'reality', 'only', 'momentarily', 'own', 'reality', 'However', 'film', 'also', 'kicks', 'Cherie', 'Blair', 'Alasdair', 'Campbell', 'are', 'portrayed', 'extremely', 'arrogant', 'self-righteous', 'way', 'are', 'separated', 'common', 'man', 'Prince', 'Philip.The', 'also', 'one', 'more', 'reason', 'why', 'queen', 'hesitated', 'assume', 'leadership', 'grieving', 'masses', 'also', 'experienced', '1930s', 'had', 'terrible', 'fear', 'what', 'could', 'happen', 'times', 'mass-hysteria', 'did', 'not', 'wan', 'part', 'role', 'monarch', 'being', 'pillar', 'stability', 'chaotic', 'world.The', 'film', 'clear', 'judgement', 'actions', 'queen', 'explanation', 'actions', 'possible', 'understanding.The', 'film', 'can', 'also', 'be', 'seen', 'comment', 'Tony', 'Blair', 'got', 'caugh', 'swirl', 'hysteria', 'involved', 'very', 'questionable', 'invasion', 'Iraq']",The Queen
647606,AVH1BRTLRS38M,B00005JPAM,"Jackie Chan ""Alberto""","[1, 1]","This film depicts the feeling of ambiguity that was generated around the hysterical mourning for Diana Spencer. It also suggests, correctly,in a powerful way, that the impact that public opinion had which forced the Royal's response, the demand for a public display of emotion, had a fundamentally debilitating effect on people's views of the Monarchy. That the Queen actually gave the public address as her own decision, rather than from the advice of Tony Blair (as suggested in the film), would be more consistent with reality then this film. Of course the Prime Minister would never offer such advice nor would the correspondence between the Queen and the Prime Minister ever be divulged. Firstly, such a suggestion would pressure the Queen to be political, and secondly, no correspondence between a monarch and a Prime Minister concerning a fundamental issue of constitutional duty would be divulged because it would violate state protocol (its something for historians 200 years from now to read about).  I lived next to Hyde Park in a University of London hall of residence when the events this film  depicted actually took place, there were plenty of people who went to the park because they were mystified by the outpouring of emotion.  What this film does show very bluntly is how the population forced a change in Royal protocol.  The flying of the flag at half-mast, the intermixing between the crowd and the Queen. In the scene depicting the intermixing there is a sound over from a TV news broadcast saying that this hadn't happened since the celebration of the end of the second world war. That suddenly said it all for us who were there but skeptical.  This nothing of a woman, Diana, that everyone had read feelings and emotion into, forced the Monarch to do something that hadn't been done since the end of WW2, and then in celebration.  Well, I guess the death of Diana was exactly the same as a war that killed 50 odd million people, wasn't it? I guess flying the flag at half mast was correct after its role for centuries had been simply to denote the presence of the Monarch. What is implied in this movie is exactly what has happened in Britain since the Diana event: the monarchy, the constitutional symbol of Britain, has diminished in significance in people's minds and people have forgotten about Diana.  The Queen's instincts to remain aloof were correct. Her action, forced on her by a mob of morons who were boobyed by Diana's death, has helped undermine the British sense of self. In these days of economic problems, the Queen is no longer someone beyond politics and  worldliness to look to for comforting support.

A little bit of tenderness would have gone a long way to make this a much more enjoyable experience.

And the film has aged to. This big vignette, this enormous cameo in normal life that this week after the tragic end of a young woman was has become quaint, charmingly quaint but with little meaning left. During that week, or even that summer, the monarchy nearly fell in England but the Queen, though surrounded by too many people who were deaf and blind, managed to hear the piece of advice given to her by Tony Blair and she followed it and saved that monarchy. Is that what happened or not? That is not the problem. It is reassuring to believe it is what happened. But it is also important to understand that in today's world what counts is public opinion. We may think public opinion is looking for emotional and sentimental empathy instead of real deep inner grief. But this public opinion remains the yardstick with which we are to measure and determine our behavior. Apparently Stephen Frears wants to make us believe that Elizabeth II did feel and understand the necessity to accept that rule. Something of the kind surely happened. Yet the film is in no way transcendingly immortal.

Meanwhile, the Queen is torn between protocol and what appear to be her own emotions regarding Diana's death.Your opinion of the monarchy after the tragedy of Diana won't be swayed much one way or the other by this movie as Stephen Frears plays it pretty close to the hip.  About the only thing new is the apparent feelings of Tony Blair in regard to the monarchy, doing his best to advise the royal family of the impact the death of Diana was having on the British people at the time, and getting them to come out of their sequestered Balmoral estate, where most of the action takes place.

647615,A2OU415LB9I5J6,B00005JPAM,Jason C. Wilkerson,"[3, 3]","Shortly after the election of Tony Blair (Michael Sheen) to the position of Prime Minister, Princess Diana was killed in a horrific car accident. As the British public clamors for an open memorial for the woman Prime Minister Blair called ""The People's Princess"", Queen Elizabeth II (Helen Mirren) chooses to keep everything private, taking her grandsons to Balmoral Castle to help them in their time of loss. Without any word from the royal family though, the British people become angered, and are soon close to calling for the dissolution of the crown.Princess Diana's death was a very tragic event that led to a sense of lost amongst people the world over. It's no secret that Queen Elizabeth II and Princess Di did not get along, especially when considering the fact that Diana was not quiet about her former husband's, Prince Charles, infidelity among other things and was dating a Muslim. Shortly before Diana's death, Tony Blair was elected to the position of Prime Minister, and while things looked somewhat smooth, no one could have expected the hardships he was about to go through in dealing with what became something of a national crisis. Depicting a situation like this isn't an easy task for film, so how did Stephen Frears do with his movie The Queen?Amazingly! With a script written by Peter Morgan (Frost/ Nixon, The Damned United, The Last King of Scotland, etc.) which is actually the second in something of a series starring Michael Sheen as Tony Blair, The Queen is not only a look at the inner workings of the British government in a time of crisis, but is also a look at the differences between the branches of government and the way they think. Throughout the movie you see that the Queen and the royal family are very old school, choosing to hide emotion and mourn in private rather than display their feelings to the world. They also don't believe that Diana should be mourned on a public level since she no longer was a member of the royal family. Then you have Tony Blair who wants to move the government in a new direction, and can't believe the way the royal family is handling this: with a lack of warmth in their proceedings. You see Blair trying his best to do what he can for a family that, from the outside, doesn't appear to want to do anything for itself. Working off interviews from unnamed sources within the queen's employ and staffers who worked with Blair, Morgan crafts a script that catches the nuances of the inner workings of the government in this type of situation.To really bring this out, you really need great acting, and in Michael Sheen as Tony Blair and Helen Mirren as Queen Elizabeth II you completely see the struggles, differences, and even similarities between these two figures. As Queen Elizabeth II, Helen Mirren shows you a woman who is strong and solid in her ways but also worries about her position in the history of the monarchy. Mirren's performance is truly the tour de force of the film, but one also can't count out Michael Sheen's portrayal of Prime Minister Blair. You see Blair as a man trying to lead Britain into a new era, and sees things differently with the monarchy, but still holds the monarchy in high regard. As the people start to turn on the monarchy you see him as a man who is, not trying to tell the monarchy what to do, but trying to help the monarchy through a crisis into a better position in the court of public opinion, and Sheen masterfully embodies this.Never does the movie take a position as to whether the monarchy is good or bad, outdated or what Britain needs at this time. It doesn't examine Princess Diana's life, or who was at fault in her death. A masterful feat for the director, the movie really just examines the monarchy and the British government in this day and age through this crisis. On top of that, the eye for attention to detail is amazing. You see the difference between the settings where the monarch lives and the lower levels of the government reside, and the images of the country side at Balmoral Castle, and the views of the castle interior are breathtaking. Accomplishing this kind of movie in this day and age is a great achievement.If you're a fan of films dealing with history, or the inner workings of government, particularly the British government I highly recommend this film. With superb acting, directing, and writing this film shows what any film dealing in this nature of material should really be like.5/5",5,The Queen,1262476800,"01 3, 2010",2010,4443,"['Shortly', 'election', 'Tony', 'Blair', 'Michael', 'Sheen', 'position', 'Prime', 'Minister', 'Princess', 'Diana', 'was', 'killed', 'horrific', 'car', 'accident', 'British', 'public', 'clamors', 'open', 'memorial', 'woman', 'Prime', 'Minister', 'Blair', 'called', 'People', 'Princess', 'Queen', 'Elizabeth', 'II', 'Helen', 'Mirren', 'keep', 'everything', 'private', 'taking', 'grandsons', 'Balmoral', 'Castle', 'help', 'time', 'loss', 'word', 'royal', 'family', 'British', 'people', 'become', 'angered', 'are', 'soon', 'close', 'calling', 'dissolution', 'crown.Princess', 'Diana', 'death', 'was', 'very', 'tragic', 'event', 'led', 'sense', 'lost', 'amongst', 'people', 'world', 'secret', 'Queen', 'Elizabeth', 'II', 'Princess', 'Di', 'did', 'not', 'get', 'along', 'especially', 'when', 'considering', 'fact', 'Diana', 'was', 'not', 'quiet', 'former', 'husband', 'Prince', 'Charles', 'infidelity', 'other', 'things', 'was', 'dating', 'Muslim', 'Shortly', 'Diana', 'death', 'Tony', 'Blair', 'was', 'elected', 'position', 'Prime', 'Minister', 'things', 'looked', 'somewhat', 'smooth', 'one', 'could', 'have', 'expected', 'hardships', 'was', 'about', 'go', 'dealing', 'what', 'became', 'something', 'national', 'crisis', 'Depicting', 'situation', ""n't"", 'easy', 'task', 'film', 'how', 'did', 'Stephen', 'Frears', 'do', 'movie', 'Queen', 'Amazingly', 'script', 'written', 'Peter', 'Morgan', 'Frost/', 'Nixon', 'Damned', 'United', 'Last', 'King', 'Scotland', 'etc', 'actually', 'second', 'something', 'series', 'starring', 'Michael', 'Sheen', 'Tony', 'Blair', 'Queen', 'not', 'only', 'look', 'inner', 'workings', 'British', 'government', 'time', 'crisis', 'also', 'look', 'differences', 'branches', 'government', 'way', 'think', 'movie', 'see', 'Queen', 'royal', 'family', 'are', 'very', 'old', 'school', 'choosing', 'hide', 'emotion', 'mourn', 'private', 'rather', 'display', 'feelings', 'world', 'also', 'do', ""n't"", 'believe', 'Diana', 'should', 'be', 'mourned', 'public', 'level', 'no', 'longer', 'was', 'member', 'royal', 'family', 'Then', 'have', 'Tony', 'Blair', 'who', 'move', 'government', 'new', 'direction', 'ca', ""n't"", 'believe', 'way', 'royal', 'family', 'handling', 'lack', 'warmth', 'proceedings', 'see', 'Blair', 'trying', 'best', 'do', 'what', 'can', 'family', 'outside', ""n't"", 'appear', 'want', 'do', 'anything', 'Working', 'off', 'interviews', 'unnamed', 'sources', 'queen', 'employ', 'staffers', 'who', 'worked', 'Blair', 'Morgan', 'script', 'nuances', 'inner', 'workings', 'government', 'type', 'situation.To', 'really', 'bring', 'out', 'really', 'need', 'great', 'acting', 'Michael', 'Sheen', 'Tony', 'Blair', 'Helen', 'Mirren', 'Queen', 'Elizabeth', 'II', 'completely', 'see', 'struggles', 'differences', 'even', 'similarities', 'two', 'figures', 'Queen', 'Elizabeth', 'II', 'Helen', 'Mirren', 'woman', 'who', 'strong', 'solid', 'ways', 'also', 'position', 'history', 'monarchy', 'Mirren', 'performance', 'truly', 'tour', 'force', 'film', 'one', 'also', 'ca', ""n't"", 'count', 'out', 'Michael', 'Sheen', 'portrayal', 'Prime', 'Minister', 'Blair', 'see', 'Blair', 'man', 'trying', 'lead', 'Britain', 'new', 'era', 'sees', 'things', 'differently', 'monarchy', 'still', 'monarchy', 'high', 'regard', 'people', 'start', 'turn', 'monarchy', 'see', 'man', 'who', 'not', 'trying', 'tell', 'monarchy', 'what', 'do', 'trying', 'help', 'monarchy', 'crisis', 'better', 'position', 'court', 'public', 'opinion', 'Sheen', 'masterfully', 'this.Never', 'movie', 'take', 'position', 'monarchy', 'good', 'bad', 'outdated', 'what', 'Britain', 'time', ""n't"", 'examine', 'Princess', 'Diana', 'life', 'who', 'was', 'fault', 'death', 'masterful', 'feat', 'director', 'movie', 'really', 'just', 'examines', 'monarchy', 'British', 'government', 'day', 'age', 'crisis', 'top', 'eye', 'attention', 'detail', 'amazing', 'see', 'difference', 'settings', 'where', 'monarch', 'lower', 'levels', 'government', 'reside', 'images', 'country', 'side', 'Balmoral', 'Castle', 'views', 'castle', 'interior', 'are', 'breathtaking', 'Accomplishing', 'kind', 'movie', 'day', 'age', 'great', 'achievement.If', ""'re"", 'fan', 'films', 'dealing', 'history', 'inner', 'workings', 'government', 'particularly', 'British', 'government', 'highly', 'recommend', 'film', 'superb', 'acting', 'directing', 'writing', 'film', 'what', 'film', 'dealing', 'nature', 'material', 'should', 'really', 'be', 'like.5/5']",The Queen

647617,A106016KSI0YQ,B00005JPAM,Jay Dickson,"[2, 2]","The cleverness of the premise of THE QUEEN--together with its career-defining performance by Helen Mirren--helped put it over the top with most critics in 2006 when it was released. Even now, when it's possible to look at it with a bit more soberness, it seems pretty nifty. The whole idea of doing a serious and intelligent look at the function of the constitutional monarch in contemporary Britain during its period of greatest trial (the death of Diana, Princess of Wales, and the outpouring of grief it produced and its new demands for a response from the queen) is just about irresistible, and the performance of Helen Mirren in the title role is nothing short of astounding.  One of the key plot devices (the hunting of the giant stag, ""The Monarch of the Glen,"" concurrent with the press and the Labor government's stalking of the queen) does come out as heavy-handed even more than when the film was released, and at times the film does seem a bit too much of a valentine to Elizabeth II. Despite her claims to her prime Minister Tony Blair of not going in for ""glamour and tears"" in moments of grief, we do get to see her suffering and mourning (both for Diana and for tradition) in private, and she's surrounded by such a pack of stiffs away at Balmoral that it's impossible not to feel sympathetic for her. The film conceives the other members of her family as strictly two-dimensional: Prince Philip (James Cromwell) is a sour bully, the Prince of Wales (Alex Jennings) is an opportunistic whiner, and the Queen Mother (Sylvia Syms) is an addled tippler. Compared with this lot, how could she help but come out smelling like a rose? Fortunately, Mirren is unafraid of bringing out the character's sourness when it suits her, and occasionally makes some wonderfully unexpected withering comments to her secretary (Roger Allam) and to Tony Blair (Michael Sheen, also terrific). Even though this is a plum role, Mirren is such a brave and strong actress that she makes even more of it than you'd think: she's absolutely marvelous in the final scene, where the hurt queen comes to meet with Tony Blair months after he thinks they have scored a victory with the public relations over Diana's funeral while she's still smarting from the wounds inflicted upon her by her people.The big disappointments with this DVD release are its extras. There are some lovely moments on the ""Making of.."" brief documentary where Mirren explains her approach to the character, but there should have been much more from her and Michael Sheen. There are two sets of commentaries, one from royal expert Robert Lacey that's pretty standard (explaining away all the minor bits of court etiquette) and one from the director Stephen Frears speaking with the screenwriter Peter Morgan that's nothing short of disastrous. Obviously Frears and Morgan did not prepare for the commentary properly and felt that they had said everything about the film that needed to be said, because they offer very few illuminations about their ideas behind the work or the acting and directing; instead, they natter on about such dull trivia as why James Cromwell wears two dressing gowns and how the rooms they used to stand in for the drawing rooms at Buckingham Palace look nothing like the real thing. They come across as every bit as self-satisfied and as unrevealing as the very people the story is about. So skip the commentaries, and stay instead with the fine film as it is.",4,Stiff Upper Lips,1184112000,"07 11, 2007",2007,3446,"['cleverness', 'premise', 'THE', 'QUEEN', 'together', 'career-defining', 'performance', 'Helen', 'Mirren', 'helped', 'put', 'top', 'most', 'critics', '2006', 'when', 'was', 'released', 'Even', 'now', 'when', 'possible', 'look', 'bit', 'more', 'soberness', 'pretty', 'nifty', 'whole', 'idea', 'doing', 'serious', 'intelligent', 'look', 'function', 'constitutional', 'monarch', 'contemporary', 'Britain', 'period', 'greatest', 'trial', 'death', 'Diana', 'Princess', 'Wales', 'outpouring', 'grief', 'produced', 'new', 'demands', 'response', 'queen', 'just', 'about', 'irresistible', 'performance', 'Helen', 'Mirren', 'title', 'role', 'nothing', 'short', 'astounding', 'One', 'key', 'plot', 'devices', 'hunting', 'giant', 'stag', 'Monarch', 'Glen', 'concurrent', 'press', 'Labor', 'government', 'stalking', 'queen', 'come', 'out', 'heavy-handed', 'even', 'more', 'when', 'film', 'was', 'released', 'times', 'film', 'seem', 'bit', 'too', 'much', 'valentine', 'Elizabeth', 'II', 'claims', 'prime', 'Minister', 'Tony', 'Blair', 'not', 'going', 'glamour', 'tears', 'moments', 'grief', 'do', 'get', 'see', 'suffering', 'mourning', 'Diana', 'tradition', 'private', 'surrounded', 'such', 'pack', 'stiffs', 'away', 'Balmoral', 'impossible', 'not', 'feel', 'sympathetic', 'film', 'other', 'members', 'family', 'strictly', 'two-dimensional', 'Prince', 'Philip', 'James', 'Cromwell', 'sour', 'bully', 'Prince', 'Wales', 'Alex', 'Jennings', 'opportunistic', 'whiner', 'Queen', 'Mother', 'Sylvia', 'Syms', 'addled', 'tippler', 'Compared', 'lot', 'how', 'could', 'help', 'come', 'out', 'smelling', 'rose', 'Fortunately', 'Mirren', 'unafraid', 'bringing', 'out', 'character', 'sourness', 'when', 'suits', 'occasionally', 'wonderfully', 'unexpected', 'withering', 'comments', 'secretary', 'Roger', 'Allam', 'Tony', 'Blair', 'Michael', 'Sheen', 'also', 'terrific', 'Even', 'plum', 'role', 'Mirren', 'such', 'brave', 'strong', 'actress', 'even', 'more', ""'d"", 'think', 'absolutely', 'marvelous', 'final', 'scene', 'where', 'hurt', 'queen', 'meet', 'Tony', 'Blair', 'months', 'have', 'scored', 'victory', 'public', 'relations', 'Diana', 'funeral', 'still', 'smarting', 'wounds', 'inflicted', 'people.The', 'big', 'disappointments', 'DVD', 'release', 'are', 'extras', 'are', 'lovely', 'moments', 'Making', 'of..', 'brief', 'documentary', 'where', 'Mirren', 'approach', 'character', 'there', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'much', 'more', 'Michael', 'Sheen', 'are', 'two', 'sets', 'commentaries', 'one', 'royal', 'expert', 'Robert', 'Lacey', 'pretty', 'standard', 'explaining', 'away', 'minor', 'bits', 'court', 'etiquette', 'one', 'director', 'Stephen', 'Frears', 'speaking', 'screenwriter', 'Peter', 'Morgan', 'nothing', 'short', 'disastrous', 'Obviously', 'Frears', 'Morgan', 'did', 'not', 'prepare', 'commentary', 'properly', 'felt', 'had', 'said', 'everything', 'film', 'needed', 'be', 'said', 'offer', 'very', 'few', 'illuminations', 'ideas', 'work', 'acting', 'directing', 'instead', 'natter', 'such', 'dull', 'trivia', 'why', 'James', 'Cromwell', 'two', 'dressing', 'gowns', 'how', 'rooms', 'used', 'stand', 'drawing', 'rooms', 'Buckingham', 'Palace', 'look', 'nothing', 'real', 'thing', 'come', 'bit', 'self-satisfied', 'as', 'unrevealing', 'very', 'people', 'story', 'about', 'So', 'skip', 'commentaries', 'stay', 'instead', 'fine', 'film']",The Queen
647618,A140XH16IKR4B0,B00005JPAM,Jean E. Pouliot,"[0, 0]","The poster for ""The Queen"" - practically a study in Elizabeth's facial pores - led me to sense that the film would be a savage attack on the Queen and the monarchy. Instead, I found it to be an evenhanded and even sympathetic glance into the reaction of the Royal Family to British rage over their evident coolness to Princess Diana's death in 1997.The film portrays the events in question in a fairly straightforward manner. After Diana's final death ride, the Queen and her family are rousted from sleep and watch the unfolding story on television at Balmoral castle in Scotland, privately expressing heartfelt annoyance that Diana is again generating attention. Prince Philip (played admirably by American actor James Cromwell) is especially furious throughout the film, expressing the royals' contempt for Diana and what they felt was public mawkishness egged on by the British press. Their official reaction (except, curiously, for Prince Charles's) was unemotional and measured, driven by protocol (whether to raise the Royal standard to half staff or to make public statements) and a continuing desire to keep Diana in her place.Newly-elected PM Tony Blair (an incredible Michael Sheen) opposes the royals, but his close contact with them also lets him understand their point of view. Going against his young staff, whose anti-royal stance has them enjoying the Royal discomfort, Blair shows himself perhaps a bit too sympathetic to the Queen's plight, a tendency that might explain his recent woes.""The Queen"" is a study in contrasts -- between the royal world of starchy reserve that no longer inspires, and the messiness of Tony Blair's TV-watching and cereal-chomping young family; between a confessional media culture (that Diana played to the hilt) and an older culture that prized privacy and decorum above all. The fun of the film is watching the Royals becoming aware of the need to embrace this new culture and by so doing remain at least minimally relevant to their people.Helen Mirren both impersonates her subject (!) and interprets her. Mirren's performance helps the audience make sense of the Queen's inner struggle as well as of her professional carapace of detachment. A scene where she throw her pack of dogs of morsel of meat, and then with a hand gesture commands them to wait (they do!) before eating it, exemplifies the self-control that Elizabeth demands of herself and expects of those around her. Only once did the movie leap the bounds of plausibility, as the Queen, driving her own truck around Balmoral at the height of the crisis, gets stuck in the middle of a river. Her sighting of a beautiful, hunted animal begins to open her eyes to her people's grief over Diana, another beautiful ""animal"" hunted to death. Though the scene screams ""metaphor!,"" the script is silent, allowing the viewer to make the connection.The DVD extras are spare, consisting of a not-too-revelatory ""making of"" mini-flick.""The Queen"" is a standout movie, very solidly cast, very well-written, daring and successful in tackling recent events, believable and illustrative of the time period. That it does not hit one over the head with facile conclusions -- and that it allows a variety of points of view to co-exist unresolved -- demonstates its confidence and is very attractive.

Toss any mention of awards out the window, truely see this film for a rare opportunity to see a powerful and meaningful lead female performance. I mean performance in every new sense of the word. It almost reminds me of the possessive performance last year by Philip Seymour Hoffman as Capote. I can only imagine the homework needed for such insightful and catapulting performances. This isn't a directors film, its a film carried by its actors, much like this years Dreamgirls but yet it blends so seemlessly together that without some sort of nod in Stephen Frears, I would feel consciously guilty. It takes the 'right' man for the job to capture all the goodness of this film and not flounder it! At least I must imagine. Sort of like too much talent on one basketball team, and you end up with only a conference championship because of the impossible complexities and overwhelming duty towards placing all of them coherently together.

When she was tragically killed it hit me (just like millions and millions of people around the world) very hard. She was so beautiful on the outside and on the inside. She was also very unique, because (perhaps?) she was the only member of this crazy family, the royals that had a heart and soul.""The Queen"" stars legendary veteran actress Helen Mirren who plays the title role. ""The Queen"" deals with both the public's reaction to Princess Diana's tragic death, as well as the Queen's/royal family's cold and unsympathetic feelings towards this tragedy.I am not sure if the producers of ""The Queen"" were trying to shed a positive light on Queen Elizabeth? If they were though, it would have been nice if they would have discussed her life in greater detail so the viewers could gain a better understanding in to this complex individual.But after watching this picture I really believe that the Queen is a very cold person. She is more interested in what the press has to say about her and her family, but she is never seen comforting her grandchildren or even talking to them!Helen Mirren's portrayal of the Queen was really scary because she looked just like her! I have no idea how the Queen behaves in private but I can only suspect that Helen Mirren was really on the money because she acted just the way most people would probably expect the Queen to behave.Michael Sheen played the newly elected Tony Blair. Did anyone else find it odd that a prime minister of one of the richest countries in the world was portrayed as a desperately middle-class man in a very middle-class home? I found that very unrealistic.Tony Blair tried to evoke some type of humanity into the Queen after it was apparent to the British people that she did not give a hoot about poor Princess Diana. He even acted as publicity agent, spinning stories about the Queen's departure from London and tight-lipped stance. It seemed that he was trying to play both sides of the fence though, although he did win much brownie points for his involvement during this tragic time in British history.I found the performance of Helen McCrory (playing Mrs. Cherie Blair) to be top-notch as well. She was very comical in many scenes (her curtsey to the Queen was so different), and she also lent a little bit of realism to this picture. Because as Cherie described, the Queen and her entire family are a bunch of emotionally retarded people.Princess Diana was the most famous women in the world. Is that why the Windsors disliked her?

Cofield,"[3, 4]","The Queen depicts The House of Windsor during one of its most tumultuous weeks: that which followed the death of Diana, Princess of Wales in 1997. Helen Mirren as Queen Elizabeth II does a magnificent job portraying the monarch's quandaries as she is faced with a challenge for which her forty five year long reign has not prepared her: how to deal with the sudden death of a former daughter-in-law who was deeply and uncharacteristically emotionally beloved by the British.The film opens in May 1997 with the election of Tony Blair.  His visit to Buckingham Palace, accompanied by his republican-minded wife, is one of the funniest scenes in the film as Her Majesty gently but firmly puts him in his place: ""I'm the one who asks, Mr. Blair.""  Then the film turns darker as we see Diana's last summer in a photo montage, culminating in the paparazzi chase which led to the fatal car crash in Paris.  We relive the shock felt by the Royal Family, the Government, and the world as the news spread, and then we are led through the negotiations as Mr. Blair carefully helps the Queen recognize that her first reaction, to treat the death as a private family matter, is untenable in the face of deep national mourning.There are many fine scenes in this film.  I am especially fond of the elk scene, where the Queen, stranded at Balmoral, gives way to some private tears.  I also love a brief moment of tenderness that crosses her face when she watches Charles telling his sons about their mother's death. (I am also impressed with how tactful the film's producers were in not showing close ups of William and Harry during that awful week).  Tony Blair's losing patience with his staff's sniping at the Queen and angrily  defending her is also very fine.  But the most moving moment comes when the Queen makes her way through the crowds at Buckingham Palace, feeling cold and rejected until the little girl hands her a bouquet saying ""They're for you."" That scene, and the following one as the women begin to curtsey, brings tears to my eyes. Finally, the Queen's  warning to Blair that he too will fall someday has a particularly ironic ring these days.The DVD production is well made, but with few extras beyond an audio commentary and a featurette on the film's production.

647633,A9TG2NFA614S9,B00005JPAM,John F. Rooney,"[0, 1]","""The Queen"" (2006) is a wonderful, fascinating movie with a great script, superior cinematography, and great acting by Helen Mirren as Queen Elizabeth II and by Michael Sheen as a toothy Tony Blair. It's all about the death of Prince Diana, the royals' reaction and behavior after her death and the way the public in an outpouring of grief turned their wrath against the royal family believing them to be indifferent to her death.Looking back, the paroxysms of grief that were displayed by the public now seem excessive. Viewing the movie now, I think viewers may be slightly more sympathetic toward the Queen.The movie portrays the royal family with Prince Philip, Elizabeth's husband (expertly played by actor James Cromwell) as a mean-spirited and nasty man who always has to put his oar in. The Queen Mum (in a brilliant piece of casting played by Sylvia Syms) is cold-hearted. Prince Charles is ineffectual, weak, and bungling. The Queen shows her disdain for him and has some nasty cracks to make about her playgirl sister Margaret.All of this, of course, involves guesswork and supposition by the screenwriter since few were privy to what went on in the royal establishment. When Diana died, the royals were ensconced in Balmoral Castle in Scotland. Callous Prince Philip took the boys (Prince William and Hall, not portrayed in the movie) out hunting for a stag during the mourning period.The Queen and royals remained in Balmoral while the public seethed. The movie shows the newly elected Blair benefiting from the furor and shows him imploring the Queen to show some consideration for her subjects who wanted her to be almost mourner-in-chief. Finally Blair convinces the Queen that the media is after her head, and the public is turning against the monarchy.Through all of this Helen Mirren does a masterful job of making the Queen a flawed but real and human person.Newsreel footage is used with great skill. It's an engrossing look at the royals. Elizabeth drives herself around the huge Balmoral estate, and she sees a beautiful stag. The symbolism of the stag is not completely clear, whether it shows Elizabeth's reaction to her predicament, whether it's Diana, or whether it shows that she values animals above human beings.",5,A Movie Worth Watching Over and Over,1265500800,"02 7, 2010",2010,2242,"['Queen', '2006', 'wonderful', 'fascinating', 'movie', 'great', 'script', 'superior', 'cinematography', 'great', 'acting', 'Helen', 'Mirren', 'Queen', 'Elizabeth', 'II', 'Michael', 'Sheen', 'toothy', 'Tony', 'Blair', 'death', 'Prince', 'Diana', 'royals', 'reaction', 'behavior', 'death', 'way', 'public', 'outpouring', 'grief', 'turned', 'wrath', 'royal', 'family', 'believing', 'be', 'indifferent', 'death.Looking', 'back', 'paroxysms', 'grief', 'were', 'displayed', 'public', 'now', 'seem', 'excessive', 'Viewing', 'movie', 'now', 'think', 'viewers', 'may', 'be', 'slightly', 'more', 'sympathetic', 'Queen.The', 'movie', 'royal', 'family', 'Prince', 'Philip', 'Elizabeth', 'husband', 'expertly', 'played', 'actor', 'James', 'Cromwell', 'mean-spirited', 'nasty', 'man', 'who', 'always', 'put', 'oar', 'Queen', 'Mum', 'brilliant', 'piece', 'casting', 'played', 'Sylvia', 'Syms', 'cold-hearted', 'Prince', 'Charles', 'ineffectual', 'weak', 'bungling', 'Queen', 'disdain', 'nasty', 'cracks', 'make', 'playgirl', 'sister', 'Margaret.All', 'course', 'guesswork', 'supposition', 'screenwriter', 'few', 'were', 'privy', 'what', 'went', 'royal', 'establishment', 'When', 'Diana', 'died', 'royals', 'were', 'ensconced', 'Balmoral', 'Castle', 'Scotland', 'Callous', 'Prince', 'Philip', 'took', 'boys', 'Prince', 'William', 'Hall', 'not', 'portrayed', 'movie', 'out', 'hunting', 'stag', 'mourning', 'period.The', 'Queen', 'royals', 'remained', 'Balmoral', 'public', 'seethed', 'movie', 'newly', 'elected', 'Blair', 'benefiting', 'furor', 'imploring', 'Queen', 'show', 'consideration', 'subjects', 'who', 'wanted', 'be', 'almost', 'mourner-in-chief', 'Finally', 'Blair', 'Queen', 'media', 'head', 'public', 'turning', 'monarchy.Through', 'Helen', 'Mirren', 'masterful', 'job', 'making', 'Queen', 'flawed', 'real', 'human', 'person.Newsreel', 'footage', 'used', 'great', 'skill', 'engrossing', 'look', 'royals', 'Elizabeth', 'huge', 'Balmoral', 'estate', 'beautiful', 'stag', 'symbolism', 'stag', 'not', 'completely', 'clear', 'Elizabeth', 'reaction', 'predicament', 'Diana', 'animals', 'human', 'beings']",The Queen

Whatever she was, it was totally as the result of being the wife of the next king of Britain & the mother of the heir, with a spare. Those pseudo-mourners who hate the royals need to remember without a monarchy, Diane would have been a cute, kindergarten teacher from a prominent family. Her charitible works, eliminating land mines, helping people with AIDS could have been done by anyone if given her oppotunities. The first one, marrying into the royal family & the second, sleeping with the son of one of the richest men in the world. That royalty should even exist as parasites on the British people, the fact is they do. Therefore the people demanded the Queen grieve as they did. Give her grandsons up to be viewed & pitied. It was not her way. Helen Mirren was dead on as the Queen, as was Michael Sheen as the PM, Tony Blair. Always the politician, Blair was instrumential in convincing the Queen into making a statement concerning Diane's death, as he did. The monarchy does move toward modernity at glacial speed. The evolution from the Queen Mum, to Elizabeth, to Charles is evident in this movie. He considers himself a modern man. Even 10 years ago...not. His son, William also a future King, is. Although this movie takes place in a short period of time in 1997 you get a lot of inside information on the monarchy & the life of Elizabeth II. I think she is loved, & respected as maybe representing not the way things are but once were. Maybe not such a bad thing.

647636,AKT8TGIT6VVZ5,B00005JPAM,John Kwok,"[1, 1]","Stephen Frears's ""The Queen"" is one of the best films of 2006, and undoubtedly among the most intriguing ""docudramas"" I've been fortunate to come across. It is probably most memorable for Helen Mirren's superb portrayal of Queen Elizabeth II, transforming the icy head of the British royal house of Windsor into a remarkably complex, all too human, individual, dedicated to her outmoded notions of loyalty and duty to both her British subjects and her own dysfunctional royal family. Without question, Mirren has truly made this role into one of the crowning achievements of her superb acting career, and it is an achievement that deserves not only the Academy Award nomination that it has earned, but hopefully, the award itself, along with the awards and other honors she has received already. James Cromwell is almost as impressive too, portraying the dour Prince Phillip,  Duke of Edinburgh (He reacts to the news of Princess Diana's death by taking her young sons on a series of hunting trips on the vast estate of Balmoral Castle, in Scotland, where the royal family is spending the summer of 1997.) and, so is Michael Sheen as the young British Prime Minister Tony Blair, who's been forced unexpectedly to deal with the first major political crisis of his administration, acting adroitly to serve the interests of both the Crown and the realm. Frears does a magnificient job in probing the internal dissent that's rampant in both the Windsor household and the Prime Minister's office in the aftermath of Princess Diana's death and the unexpected public grief expressed by the British public. He skillfully weaves to and fro from the fictional aspects of this docudrama to actual news footage covering Diana's death, public reaction to it, and finally, the public funeral held in London nearly a week after the automobile accident in Paris which claimed the lives of Princess Diana, her lover, and their limousine driver. Much to their credit, director Stephen Frears and writer Paul Morgan have crafted a memorable cinematic tale that treats respectfully both Queen Elizabeth II and Princess Diana, and yet, still manages to yield a truly memorable, quite sympathetic portrayal of the British monarch from Helen Mirren. Even if you're unfamiliar with the United Kingdom's government or its royal family, you'll still find much to be savored from this fascinating portrait of the House of Windsor and Prime Minister Tony Blair. Not only is ""The Queen"" among the best films of 2006, but it is also among the most memorable I have enjoyed watching in recent memory.",5,"Exuberant, Dazzling Acting from Helen Mirren, James Cromwell and Michael Sheen......",1169596800,"01 24, 2007",2007,2569,"['Stephen', 'Frears', 'Queen', 'one', 'best', 'films', '2006', 'undoubtedly', 'most', 'intriguing', 'docudramas', ""'ve"", 'been', 'fortunate', 'come', 'probably', 'most', 'memorable', 'Helen', 'Mirren', 'superb', 'portrayal', 'Queen', 'Elizabeth', 'II', 'transforming', 'icy', 'head', 'British', 'royal', 'house', 'Windsor', 'remarkably', 'complex', 'too', 'human', 'individual', 'dedicated', 'outmoded', 'notions', 'loyalty', 'duty', 'British', 'subjects', 'own', 'dysfunctional', 'royal', 'family', 'question', 'Mirren', 'truly', 'made', 'role', 'one', 'crowning', 'achievements', 'superb', 'acting', 'career', 'achievement', 'not', 'only', 'Academy', 'Award', 'nomination', 'earned', 'hopefully', 'award', 'awards', 'other', 'honors', 'received', 'already', 'James', 'Cromwell', 'almost', 'impressive', 'too', 'portraying', 'dour', 'Prince', 'Phillip', 'Duke', 'Edinburgh', 'news', 'Princess', 'Diana', 'death', 'taking', 'young', 'sons', 'series', 'hunting', 'trips', 'vast', 'estate', 'Balmoral', 'Castle', 'Scotland', 'where', 'royal', 'family', 'spending', 'summer', '1997', 'so', 'Michael', 'Sheen', 'young', 'British', 'Prime', 'Minister', 'Tony', 'Blair', 'who', 'been', 'forced', 'unexpectedly', 'deal', 'first', 'major', 'political', 'crisis', 'administration', 'acting', 'adroitly', 'serve', 'interests', 'Crown', 'realm', 'Frears', 'magnificient', 'job', 'probing', 'internal', 'dissent', 'rampant', 'Windsor', 'household', 'Prime', 'Minister', 'office', 'aftermath', 'Princess', 'Diana', 'death', 'unexpected', 'public', 'grief', 'expressed', 'British', 'public', 'skillfully', 'fro', 'fictional', 'aspects', 'docudrama', 'actual', 'news', 'footage', 'covering', 'Diana', 'death', 'public', 'reaction', 'finally', 'public', 'funeral', 'held', 'London', 'nearly', 'week', 'automobile', 'accident', 'Paris', 'claimed', 'lives', 'Princess', 'Diana', 'lover', 'limousine', 'driver', 'Much', 'credit', 'director', 'Stephen', 'Frears', 'writer', 'Paul', 'Morgan', 'have', 'crafted', 'memorable', 'cinematic', 'tale', 'respectfully', 'Queen', 'Elizabeth', 'II', 'Princess', 'Diana', 'yet', 'still', 'yield', 'truly', 'memorable', 'quite', 'sympathetic', 'portrayal', 'British', 'monarch', 'Helen', 'Mirren', 'Even', ""'re"", 'unfamiliar', 'United', 'Kingdom', 'government', 'royal', 'family', ""'ll"", 'still', 'find', 'much', 'be', 'savored', 'fascinating', 'portrait', 'House', 'Windsor', 'Prime', 'Minister', 'Tony', 'Blair', 'Not', 'only', 'Queen', 'best', 'films', '2006', 'also', 'most', 'memorable', 'have', 'enjoyed', 'watching', 'recent', 'memory']",The Queen

It is well deserved, to be sure.I really loved the writing, though.  Great art delights the observer, as this movie certainly did, but it also provokes thought.  This movie refused to advocate for any one viewpoint on the British monarchy.  It constantly challenged the viewer's perceptions and beliefs about the role or importance of the British royalty, as well as its foibles, and was greatly entertaining in the process.  I like my viewpoints challenged, and that certainly was the case here.Some would call that shifting gears or even audience manipulation.  I would not, not at all.I finished the movie still thinking (as I did before) that the amount of money and attention spent on the British royalty could much better be focused elsewhere, but at least had to concede, grudgingly, that royalty had (and has) some broad purpose.

647638,AOU1I52M83CLV,B00005JPAM,Jonathan Clark,"[6, 6]","I just viewed the film ""The Queen"" today after traveling well over an hour to a theatre that is not afraid to show movies that actually have quality at heart and not just box-office results. I find it, first, a shame that most people will not see this movie, nor, probably, will never even hear of it. It is truely a movie that was made for two reasons, the first being to actually make a well-produced, directed, and acted film. The second, to bring a very real and timely issue to the screen in the hopes that people will see it for what it truely is.The film begins on the second day of May in 1997 shortly after Tony Blair (Michael Sheen) is elected as Prime Minister of Great Britain in a landslide victory. Queen Elizabeth (Helen Mirren), of course, is grudgingly forced more or less into offering him the job which obviously he accepts with the ideas of modernization and advancement of the country at heart. Skip ahead several months and move the scene to Paris on that fateful night of Princess Diana's car accident and death at the hands of the paparazzi. A several brief phone calls later and the entire English Royal family is awake and watching the news for further up date except the young William and Harry.""How are the children, Charles"" asks Mirren.""I've decided not to wake them until we have further word on the matter"" answers Prince Charles (Alex Jennings).And so begins the struggle that each family must go through when one of their own dies; or is Diana really one of their own? To the English populist, who instantly begin attacking the royal family for showing no sign of grief or remorse; while interiorly the queen orders continuously that ""this is a private matter.""Blair is caught in the crossfire as the newly elected Prime Minister and must decide if he should side with the people or his sovereign. Trying to easy the tension between the two Blair must face off with the queen with polite, respectful, graceful tact and show the people too that the government is doing something out of all the chaos of this unexpected and troubling event.""The Queen"" is not a tabloid into the lives of the royal family; and only hints at the affair between Charles and Cammila, the supposed hatred Elizabeth and Philip have towards Diana, and inner workings of the public versus private funeral arrangements for Diana that may or may not have been stirred up out of malice, but rather shows the tame, more than likely, real life scenerio and roles played by every one who participated in them. The hatred and spite, if any, in refusing to have a public funeral was not so far as to have Elizabeth publically condemning Diana, but more so as a way to protect her grandchildren from the same fate that Diana, her whole life after being married into the royal family, spent in the presses eye. Overall the production shows the inner, much more humane, and understanding nature of the royal family than the one painted by the press.As for the film itself; production wise, it was a very nuanced approach to a subject that could have easily been reduced to an hour episode of 'Jerry Springer'. Not that I did not have my qualms about certain aspects of the movie, particularly the presences of the Queen Mother. Sylvia Syms' protrayal is nothing to be criticized, but rather the character in the screenplay always seems to be the comic relief. The 'old, senile, fat lady' who is always there for a good laugh, but really serving no other purpose than that was, unfortunatly, all she was good for in the film. But that minor detail, though so what annoying on film, was such a minor glich in an otherwise well made production.As for performances; James Cromwell (yes, that James Cromwell) as Prince Philip makes an equally headstrong, subborned partner for Elizabeth and both play off each other well. Jennings as Charles casts the Prince in a rarely seen sympathetic light as a man who did have grief to deal with after his ex-wife's death. Applause definitely go out to Michael Sheen as Tony Blair, a family man at heart who, as an outsider, eventually sees the understandable reasonings behind Elizabeth and family's privacy in the midst of both scandal and sorrow.But the real star of the show is of course Helen Mirren, in a performance as powerful, haunting, and exact that one actually forgets this is an actress portrayal and completely believes this is in fact Elizabeth the Second, Queen of England. As the title says, Mirren is definitely the queen, and it certainly would be a royal sin if this actress did not finally win an Oscar that she has so desperately earned on many occasion with her portrayals on film. Helen Mirren, along with Meryl Streep, is the most talented and versatile actress working in entertainment today.Without a doubt, 'The Queen', is easily one of the ten best films of the year; the director of 'Dangerous Liaisons' and 'Mrs. Henderson Presents' has created a stirring and important film that addresses the subjects of both the paparazzi and the private affairs of those constantly in the public eye and the portrayal they are given by the journalists and other media sources to the public as opposed to their actually workings in dealing with such issues that can have enough sorrowful impact upon them personally, let alone having the entire world watching and judging them as they grieve.",4,A Royal Sin if Helen Mirren Doesn't Win the Oscar,1162684800,"11 5,

647641,A34D06JL7LC6MU,B00005JPAM,"Joshua Miller ""Josh""","[3, 3]","I wasn't surprised when Helen Mirren was nominated for an Oscar for this film, nor was I surprised when she actually won the Oscar. Her performance was clearly (from the previews) Oscar bait, but what did surprise me was the film gaining an Oscar nod for Best Picture. Even though it had a future Oscar winning performance, was directed by Stephen Frears (who directed one of my favorite films ""Dangerous Liaisons), it didn't seem like it would be that good. Having now watched it, I still hold to the fact that it is not that good. The film has its merits and deserved its nomination for Best Original Screenplay, but Best Picture is stretching it quite a bit. I feel that ""Notes on a Scandal"" should've got the Oscar nomination spot that this film took. Anyway, Mirren plays Queen Elizabeth with Michael Sheen playing the recently appointed Prime Minister Tony Blair. Not long after The Queen accepts Blair as Prime Minister, Diana Spencer the former Princess of Wales dies in a car crash with her boyfriend Dodi Fayed. The world, not just Britain, are shocked by the news of Diana's death and is even more shocked when The Queen and her staff virtually refuse to even acknowledge the death. As her popularity suddenly drops and The Queen struggles to rule her monarchy with dignity, Blair all but takes her place as the main character...Even giving Diana the nickname ""the people's princess."" Judging by the synopsis, it seems that the movie is an attack on The Queen...And for the first half of the movie, I was thinking that it was. It's not. It's a depiction of how The Queen struggled to rise above her own values and still please her people. I doubt this movie would have been as successful as it was, had it not been for Mirren because she's really the person that carries the film. In a movie that is filled with great performances, including from James Cromwell, Michael Sheen also turns in a winning performance. I'm surprised he wasn't able to score an Oscar nomination. ""The Queen"" is not a bad film, but I certainly wouldn't rank it as one of the top 10 best films of 2006. It is, however, a short and worth watching film with a terrific performance from its leading lady.GRADE: B-",4,"Overrated, But the Performance is Great",1177718400,"04 28, 2007",2007,2196,"['was', ""n't"", 'surprised', 'when', 'Helen', 'Mirren', 'was', 'nominated', 'Oscar', 'film', 'was', 'surprised', 'when', 'actually', 'won', 'Oscar', 'performance', 'was', 'clearly', 'previews', 'Oscar', 'bait', 'what', 'did', 'surprise', 'was', 'film', 'gaining', 'Oscar', 'nod', 'Best', 'Picture', 'Even', 'had', 'future', 'Oscar', 'winning', 'performance', 'was', 'directed', 'Stephen', 'Frears', 'who', 'directed', 'one', 'favorite', 'films', 'Dangerous', 'Liaisons', 'did', ""n't"", 'seem', 'would', 'be', 'good', 'Having', 'now', 'watched', 'still', 'hold', 'fact', 'not', 'good', 'film', 'merits', 'deserved', 'nomination', 'Best', 'Original', 'Screenplay', 'Best', 'Picture', 'stretching', 'quite', 'bit', 'feel', 'Notes', 'Scandal', 'should', ""'ve"", 'got', 'Oscar', 'nomination', 'spot', 'film', 'took', 'Anyway', 'Mirren', 'Queen', 'Elizabeth', 'Michael', 'Sheen', 'playing', 'recently', 'appointed', 'Prime', 'Minister', 'Tony', 'Blair', 'Not', 'long', 'Queen', 'Blair', 'Prime', 'Minister', 'Diana', 'Spencer', 'former', 'Princess', 'Wales', 'dies', 'car', 'crash', 'boyfriend', 'Dodi', 'Fayed', 'world', 'not', 'just', 'Britain', 'are', 'shocked', 'news', 'Diana', 'death', 'even', 'more', 'shocked', 'when', 'Queen', 'staff', 'virtually', 'refuse', 'even', 'acknowledge', 'death', 'popularity', 'suddenly', 'Queen', 'rule', 'monarchy', 'dignity', 'Blair', 'place', 'main', 'character', 'Even', 'giving', 'Diana', 'nickname', 'people', 'princess', 'Judging', 'synopsis', 'movie', 'attack', 'Queen', 'first', 'half', 'movie', 'was', 'thinking', 'was', 'not', 'depiction', 'how', 'Queen', 'struggled', 'rise', 'own', 'values', 'still', 'please', 'people', 'doubt', 'movie', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'as', 'successful', 'was', 'had', 'not', 'been', 'Mirren', 'really', 'person', 'film', 'movie', 'filled', 'great', 'performances', 'including', 'James', 'Cromwell', 'Michael', 'Sheen', 'also', 'winning', 'performance', ""'m"", 'surprised', 'was', ""n't"", 'able', 'score', 'Oscar', 'nomination', 'Queen', 'not', 'bad', 'film', 'certainly', 'would', ""n't"", 'rank', 'one', 'top', '10', 'best', 'films', '2006', 'however', 'short', 'worth', 'watching', 'film', 'terrific', 'performance', 'leading', 'lady.GRADE', 'B-']",The Queen

647643,A2Y3CWITEF9JGY,B00005JPAM,"JP Salazar ""Web Developer""","[5, 7]","*no spoilers*We get very excited when an Oscar contender is found--they are hard to find nowadays. Now that we are just weeks away from 2007, we finally saw a film that has history, humanity, drama and a charismatic touch. ""The Queen"" is one of the best films we've reviewed this year. It is such an entertaining film and we are so eager to tell you about it.Story:""The Queen"" tells the ""behind the scenes"" story of how the British Royal Family and the new Tony Blair's government dealt within the first week of the death of Princess Diana on August 31, 1997. An event that shocked the world in so many levels, but especially for the British Royal Family who struggled to keep things quite. The movie focuses on Queen Elizabeth's (Helen Mirren) poor handle of the aftermath and her differences with her new prime minister (Michael Sheen) who wanted her to stop hiding and to face the nation during those difficult times.Review:There have been long speculations and conspiracy theories about Princess Diana's death. After 9 years, from time to time, we see TV shows researching the circumstances of her accident and vague conclusions of who is to blame for such a tragedy. ""The Queen"" is not about conspiracy theories, but rather about an alternative story of how the British Royal Family--especially Queen Elizabeth II--showed the world how unprepared and indifferent they were to the British People and the world to deal with a national tragedy. The movie shows the true extraordinary love the world felt for Princess Diana which is something that made some of the members of the royalty very concern.The way the story is told (almost day by day after her death) creates a realistic feel to it--almost like we were watching the events in real time similar to the movie ""United 93."" The real footage flashbacks are perfectly in place to help the story develop and create drama. ""The Queen"" also shows the British Royal Family as an orthodox old fashion family who didn't want to change their ways despise the press attacking them for that whole week. Wee see a ""behind the iron curtain"" view of who they really are; just ordinary people after all-- sometimes their behavior creates funny moments throughout the film.The acting is one of best features of ""The Queen."" Helen Mirren and Michael Sheen did a terrific job impersonating these complex and famous characters--they are very look alike to say the least. There is good chemistry while together on the screen. We see them struggling and fighting their own demons. They wanted to make things right--in their own way--but sometimes they couldn't communicate that to each other. We feel there is an Oscar buzz on any of these characters.Great accomplishments we see in the technical department. The movie is just too darn pretty to look at. We see beautiful British landscapes, great costume design and excellent photography on screen. The editing is also fluid and meticulous.The Verdict:A tragic week in the history of The Royal Family and the world, ""The Queen"" gives us its take on the week after the death of the People's Princess. The story is told almost moment by moment, tear by tear felt by everyone who knew and loved her. This movie might generate some controversy and criticism for its accuracy, but they cannot take away the fact that the film is intelligent, symbolic, adventurous and not afraid to come with its own conclusions.",5,A tragic week in the history of The Royal Family and the world,1173657600,"03 12, 2007",2007,3396,"['*no', 'spoilers*We', 'get', 'very', 'excited', 'when', 'Oscar', 'contender', 'found', 'are', 'hard', 'find', 'nowadays', 'Now', 'are', 'just', 'weeks', 'away', '2007', 'finally', 'saw', 'film', 'history', 'humanity', 'drama', 'charismatic', 'touch', 'Queen', 'one', 'best', 'films', ""'ve"", 'reviewed', 'year', 'such', 'entertaining', 'film', 'are', 'so', 'eager', 'tell', 'it.Story', 'Queen', 'scenes', 'story', 'how', 'British', 'Royal', 'Family', 'new', 'Tony', 'Blair', 'government', 'dealt', 'first', 'week', 'death', 'Princess', 'Diana', 'August', '31', '1997', 'event', 'shocked', 'world', 'so', 'many', 'levels', 'especially', 'British', 'Royal', 'Family', 'who', 'struggled', 'keep', 'things', 'quite', 'movie', 'Queen', 'Elizabeth', 'Helen', 'Mirren', 'poor', 'handle', 'aftermath', 'differences', 'new', 'prime', 'minister', 'Michael', 'Sheen', 'who', 'wanted', 'stop', 'hiding', 'face', 'nation', 'difficult', 'times.Review', 'have', 'been', 'long', 'speculations', 'conspiracy', 'theories', 'Princess', 'Diana', 'death', '9', 'years', 'time', 'time', 'see', 'TV', 'shows', 'researching', 'circumstances', 'accident', 'vague', 'conclusions', 'who', 'blame', 'such', 'tragedy', 'Queen', 'not', 'conspiracy', 'theories', 'rather', 'alternative', 'story', 'how', 'British', 'Royal', 'Family', 'especially', 'Queen', 'Elizabeth', 'II', 'showed', 'world', 'how', 'unprepared', 'indifferent', 'were', 'British', 'People', 'world', 'deal', 'national', 'tragedy', 'movie', 'true', 'extraordinary', 'world', 'felt', 'Princess', 'Diana', 'something', 'made', 'members', 'royalty', 'very', 'concern.The', 'way', 'story', 'told', 'almost', 'day', 'day', 'death', 'realistic', 'feel', 'almost', 'were', 'watching', 'events', 'real', 'time', 'similar', 'movie', 'United', '93', 'real', 'footage', 'flashbacks', 'are', 'perfectly', 'place', 'help', 'story', 'develop', 'create', 'drama', 'Queen', 'also', 'British', 'Royal', 'Family', 'orthodox', 'old', 'fashion', 'family', 'who', 'did', ""n't"", 'want', 'change', 'ways', 'despise', 'press', 'attacking', 'whole', 'week', 'Wee', 'see', 'iron', 'curtain', 'view', 'who', 'really', 'are', 'just', 'ordinary', 'people', 'sometimes', 'behavior', 'funny', 'moments', 'film.The', 'acting', 'one', 'best', 'features', 'Queen', 'Helen', 'Mirren', 'Michael', 'Sheen', 'did', 'terrific', 'job', 'impersonating', 'complex', 'famous', 'characters', 'are', 'very', 'look', 'say', 'least', 'good', 'chemistry', 'together', 'screen', 'see', 'struggling', 'fighting', 'own', 'demons', 'wanted', 'make', 'things', 'right', 'own', 'way', 'sometimes', 'could', ""n't"", 'communicate', 'other', 'feel', 'Oscar', 'buzz', 'characters.Great', 'accomplishments', 'see', 'technical', 'department', 'movie', 'just', 'too', 'darn', 'pretty', 'look', 'see', 'beautiful', 'British', 'landscapes', 'great', 'costume', 'design', 'excellent', 'photography', 'screen', 'editing', 'also', 'fluid', 'meticulous.The', 'Verdict', 'tragic', 'week', 'history', 'Royal', 'Family', 'world', 'Queen', 'take', 'week', 'death', 'People', 'Princess', 'story', 'told', 'almost', 'moment', 'moment', 'tear', 'tear', 'felt', 'everyone', 'who', 'knew', 'loved', 'movie', 'might', 'generate', 'controversy', 'criticism', 'accuracy', 'can', 'not', 'take', 'away', 'fact', 'film', 'intelligent', 'symbolic', 'adventurous', 'not', 'afraid', 'come', 'own', 'conclusions']",The Queen

They can't vote, they can't run for office, and they can't be anonymous.  The worst part is that nobody else seems to have any sympathy for them because they have so much money.  As we all know, money buys happiness.This is a docudrama, mostly about the week after Princess Diana's death.  Diana and several other characters in the movie ""appear as themselves,"" as it were, through news footage.  For that reason, we never see the two princes, even though much of the movie concerns them, and they are at Balmoral when the action takes place.  Their absence is a bit too conspicuous.The drama comes from Tony Blair's desperate attempts to get the Queen to make more of a fuss over Diana's death.  To him, it is a no-brainer: the public is terribly upset and want their Queen to help them with their grief.  To Elizabeth II, it is all hype.  Why should the flag fly at half-mast at Buckingham Palace, when that isn't even done for people who still are part of the Royal Family?  The Queen must come to terms with the cult of celebrity.The Queen and Tony Blair (ironically) are the most sympathetic characters in the movie.

thank god, finally! your death was a god send! finally we could put the shame and humiliation behind the monarch and move on!!""queen elizabeth would rather rush to show her sadness over the death of a magnificent beast that roamed in her 40,000 acres private territory, she would never, if not forced by the poll, shed tears over the loss of her ex in-law.yes, she still got feelings and concerns, but like she said, she'd rather keep for herself or only gave a little bit away to a wild animal instead of to a beautiful human being.""give my congratulations to your guest. nice shot, good hunting..."" of course, visiting a dead animal, she didn't have to wear in black.as to the movie itself, well, actually, it's quite boring.",4,a double sharp-edge knife,1168819200,"01 15, 2007",2007,2619,"['helen', 'mirren', 'always', 'performance', 'movie', 'was', 'absolutely', 'great', 'real', 'queen', 'movie', 'seemed', 'try', 'quite', 'hard', 'get', 'hidden', 'agenda', 'delivered', 'trying', 'white', 'out', 'white', 'wash', 'cold', 'tough', 'self-centered', 'egoistic', 'tough', 'cookie', 'queen', 'bee', 'wanted', 'tolerate', 'become', 'more', 'understanding', 'imperial', 'arrogance.her', 'monarch', 'appendix', 'british', 'people', 'tormented', 'love', 'hate', 'having', 'monarch', 'english', 'people', 'could', 'differ', 'differtiate', 'other', 'countries', 'show', 'other', 'people', 'are', 'different', 'still', 'have', 'strong', 'genealogy', 'back', 'old', 'old', 'time', 'even', 'might', 'admit', 'privately', 'monarch', 'just', 'symbol', 'tradition', 'necessary', 'evil', 'outcast', 'run-away', 'americans', 'who', 'got', 'nothing', 'civil', 'war', 'civil', 'right', 'movement', 'assassinations', 'mafia', 'riots', 'lobbyists', 'lying', 'presidents', 'self-serving', 'congress', 'trying', 'so', 'hard', 'dig', 'short', '200', 'years', 'history', 'only', 'found', 'not', 'much', 'boast', 'glorify', 'other', 'hand', 'resent', 'monarch', 'resent', 'forever', 'aristocratic', 'luxury', 'living', 'style', 'collected', 'tax', 'common', 'people', 'exempt', 'paying', 'tax', 'now', 'estranged', 'daily', 'struggles', 'common', 'majority.this', 'movie', 'somehow', 'tried', 'tell', 'queen', 'i', 'still', 'have', 'deal', 'lot', 'difficulties', 'burden', 'lot', 'must', 'dos', 'must', 'not', 'dos.but', 'could', 'stay', 'more', 'alert', 'focus', 'watching', 'movie', 'hidden', 'message', 'was', 'buried', 'exposed', 'very', 'subtle', 'queen', 'elizabeth', 'morned', 'death', 'magnificent', 'deer', 'more', 'death', 'diana', 'shameful', 'mistaken', 'marriage', 'monarch.she', 'shared', 'more', 'emotion', 'empathy', 'death', 'reindeer', 'death', 'diana.to', 'ex', 'daughter-in-law', 'queen', 'elizabeth', 'husband', 'showed', 'real', 'feeling', 'death', 'served', 'right', 'thank', 'god', 'finally', 'death', 'was', 'god', 'send', 'finally', 'could', 'put', 'shame', 'humiliation', 'monarch', 'move', 'queen', 'elizabeth', 'would', 'rather', 'rush', 'show', 'sadness', 'death', 'magnificent', 'beast', 'roamed', '40,000', 'acres', 'private', 'territory', 'would', 'never', 'not', 'forced', 'poll', 'shed', 'tears', 'loss', 'ex', 'in-law.yes', 'still', 'got', 'feelings', 'concerns', 'said', ""'d"", 'rather', 'keep', 'only', 'gave', 'little', 'bit', 'away', 'wild', 'animal', 'instead', 'beautiful', 'human', 'being', 'give', 'congratulations', 'guest', 'nice', 'shot', 'good', 'hunting', 'course', 'visiting', 'dead', 'animal', 'did', ""n't"", 'have', 'wear', 'black.as', 'movie', 'well', 'actually', 'quite', 'boring']",The Queen

That description is apt in describing Helen's Mirren's stellar portrayal of Elizabeth II, as well.Viewing this film as a born-and-bred American, I came away from it viewing the monarchy with new, sympathetic eyes. This isn't to say I'm now pro-monarchy...there's a scene toward the beginning of the film that's utterly priceless, where Tony Blair gets down on one knee while the Queen invites him to set up a government in her name. Michael Sheen played that scene with just the right amount of embarrassment: he looked chagrined, and like he felt like a fool, and he was right to feel that way because it looked utterly ridiculous, something so out-of-place in our time. But as the film progressed, I, like the Tony Blair character, began to have a reluctant admiration for the queen even when I disagreed with her and all she stood for. After all, this is a woman whose formative years took place during WWII, a time when ""keep calm and carry on"" was her nation's mantra. I got the sense that she wasn't cold-hearted so much as a hopeless product of her time...a time that is long past.I even felt sympathy for Prince Charles as portrayed by Alex Jennings. I got the sense that his sorrow over the loss of his sons' mother was enhanced by his guilt over his treatment of her, which made him a bit more likeable for me. (That said, I still despise the real Charles for being such a weakling as to let his mother pressure him into leaving the woman he truly loved and marrying a woman he didn't love, an innocent, inexperienced, overly emotional and highly strung young girl with whom he had nothing in common but a pedigree - and then behaving like a dog after he did marry her instead of committing to the marriage.) The director's decision to not have William and Harry be portrayed onscreen was a sensitive and wise one, I think.My husband is fond of saying that everyone is a package, made up of good and bad parts. I was reminded of that watching this film...many people tend to vilify either Charles or Diana or the Royal family in general, when the truth is that, like most families, each of them made some pretty horrific mistakes and did some stupid things, sometimes with the best intentions, sometimes for personal gain.Beautifully acted, beautifully directed, beautifully written...and all-around great character study and portrayal of cross-generational conflicts.J.W.",4,The whole package,1358380800,"01 17, 2013",2013,2469,"['words', 'spring', 'mind', 'when', 'think', 'film', 'are', 'beautifully', 'understated', 'description', 'apt', 'describing', 'Helen', 'Mirren', 'stellar', 'portrayal', 'Elizabeth', 'II', 'well.Viewing', 'film', 'born-and-bred', 'American', 'came', 'away', 'viewing', 'monarchy', 'new', 'sympathetic', 'eyes', ""n't"", 'say', ""'m"", 'now', 'pro-monarchy', 'scene', 'beginning', 'film', 'utterly', 'priceless', 'where', 'Tony', 'Blair', 'down', 'one', 'knee', 'Queen', 'set', 'up', 'government', 'name', 'Michael', 'Sheen', 'played', 'scene', 'just', 'right', 'amount', 'embarrassment', 'looked', 'chagrined', 'felt', 'fool', 'was', 'right', 'feel', 'way', 'looked', 'utterly', 'ridiculous', 'something', 'so', 'out-of-place', 'time', 'film', 'progressed', 'Tony', 'Blair', 'character', 'began', 'have', 'reluctant', 'admiration', 'queen', 'even', 'when', 'disagreed', 'stood', 'woman', 'formative', 'years', 'took', 'place', 'WWII', 'time', 'when', 'keep', 'calm', 'carry', 'was', 'nation', 'mantra', 'got', 'sense', 'was', ""n't"", 'cold-hearted', 'so', 'much', 'hopeless', 'product', 'time', 'time', 'long', 'past.I', 'even', 'felt', 'sympathy', 'Prince', 'Charles', 'portrayed', 'Alex', 'Jennings', 'got', 'sense', 'sorrow', 'loss', 'sons', 'mother', 'was', 'enhanced', 'guilt', 'treatment', 'her', 'made', 'bit', 'more', 'likeable', 'said', 'still', 'despise', 'real', 'Charles', 'being', 'such', 'weakling', 'let', 'mother', 'pressure', 'leaving', 'woman', 'truly', 'loved', 'marrying', 'woman', 'did', ""n't"", 'love', 'innocent', 'inexperienced', 'overly', 'emotional', 'highly', 'strung', 'young', 'girl', 'whom', 'had', 'nothing', 'common', 'pedigree', 'then', 'behaving', 'dog', 'did', 'marry', 'instead', 'committing', 'marriage', 'director', 'decision', 'not', 'have', 'William', 'Harry', 'be', 'portrayed', 'onscreen', 'was', 'sensitive', 'wise', 'one', 'think.My', 'husband', 'fond', 'saying', 'everyone', 'package', 'made', 'good', 'bad', 'parts', 'was', 'reminded', 'watching', 'film', 'many', 'people', 'tend', 'vilify', 'Charles', 'Diana', 'Royal', 'family', 'general', 'when', 'truth', 'most', 'families', 'made', 'pretty', 'horrific', 'mistakes', 'did', 'stupid', 'things', 'sometimes', 'best', 'intentions', 'sometimes', 'personal', 'gain.Beautifully', 'acted', 'beautifully', 'directed', 'beautifully', 'written', 'all-around', 'great', 'character', 'study', 'portrayal', 'cross-generational', 'conflicts.J.W']",The Queen

It shows the tenuous relationship between Queen Elizabeth II and the Prime Minister and traces the seeming indifference of the monarchy to the tragedy in Paris.  The Queen, Prince Philip, Charles, William, and Harry are at Balmoral Castle in Scotland when Diana is killed, and at first they do not respond to her death, calling it a ""private, family matter"" and assuming that the public would want them to handle it in a dignified and quiet manner.  Tony Blair (played brilliantly by Michael Sheen) has his hand on the pulse of the nation and he tries to warn the Queen that she is going against public opinion by staying silent.  Helen Mirren plays the queen with wonderful dignity and restraint and shows her to be the dutiful monarch that she is, but she also shows us flashes of the human side of her, such as when she admits to the Prime Minister that she has ""never been so hated before"".

Corn ""reviewer""","[7, 11]","Picking Helen Mirren to play the queen was an act of genius but even her spectacular performance could not have saved a lackluster script. I find it quite an achievement that this movie was able to create a (sometimes) sympathetic portrait of a woman who fell out of public favor in many circles after Princess Diana's death.All the politics of the situation are played out in detail, giving a look at how the Prime Minister, Tony Blair, and Mirren did a certain amount of dancing around the situation and the tensions there. The Queen was criticized for her stiffness and lack of emotion, but somehow this film manages to show the cracks in that rigid facade, doing so with a certain modicum of wit and grace. Also, I found myself surprised that the film actually made me think about the possible  benefits of a certain amount of reserve and decorum, commonly known as the ""stiff upper lip"", although I still feel there was far too much coldness on the Queen's part after the Princess died. It is a small miracle that the film manages to make her the slightest bit sympathetic, especially considering the bias many may feel against her because of her actions after Diana's death.However you feel about the terrible events of Princess Diana's tragic accident and the events that followed, this movie is a superb portrayal of a woman who may be far more complex than believed.

647656,A34D4KCP94ACJZ,B00005JPAM,K. Driscoll,"[7, 7]","Obviously Princess Diana was a heavily celebrated individual and perhaps with good reason.  Her death was a tragedy and millions mourned.  Perhaps an inferior film would've focused more on her legacy and the behind the scenes feelings that Queen Elizabeth II had regarding The Princess of Wales.  But such expression on film is probably beyond reality as the Queen is by no means a visually emotional person.  Her opinions are more of an enigma and much of that is due to her discipline as Queen.  That is why the story of the interactions between Tony Blair and Queen Elizabeth II on how Diana's death should be treated is worth telling the way it has been here.  I don't think I came to that conclusion until half way through the movie, so I found it to be a very compelling film.It opens with Tony Blair (Michael Sheen) winning the general election for Prime Minister.  Blair was of course an advocate to modernize the country so his early interactions with the Queen (Helen Mirren) were guarded right from the very beginning.  Princess Diana is soon killed in car wreck while being chased by paparazzi and Tony Blair delivers a speech that coins the title ""the People's Princess"" for Diana.  The Queen of course notes that Diana is technically no longer royalty as she divorced Prince Charles a year earlier.  She believes that the handling of Diana's funeral is to be a private affair and expresses this to Blair.  The result is of course a solid exploration of media hysteria, the Queen's devotion to her vows, and the contemporary dynamics of Royalty for better or worse.  All of these things are certainly elements I knew little about, at least to the extent it is observed here. I'm sure there are inaccuracies somewhere in this picture but not enough for me to pick up on.There are four things that make this film exceptional.  Director Stephen Frears (the Grifters, Dirty Pretty Things) and screenplay writer Peter Morgan (The Last King of Scotland) did an outstanding job in their respective roles.  There is no question that creating a convincing portrayal of this story is no easy task but they managed to pull it off.  The other two items are the performances by Michael Sheen as Tony Blair and Helen Mirren as the Queen.  Sheen was a bit overshadowed by Mirren's performance but he is definitely great.  Mirren's acting on the other hand was universally hyped as the best performance of 2006.  Having seen the film well after the hype and awards I was certainly prepared to be critical of anything but there is no question about it, Mirren was outstanding and deserved her many glowing reviews, standing ovations, and awards.  The Queen is not necessarily written to be likable but she is still the focus of the film and Mirren takes on the task of making her enjoyable to watch and even to some degree relatable.The Queen is a movie that some people will find slow, it is hardcore drama within a historical context that some will find less entertaining without a certain degree of back story.  If you found interest in what happened ten years ago in the aftermath of Diana's death then you will likely enjoy this film tremendously.

Rodriguez ""The Movie Wizard.com Revi...","[2, 2]","Biopics are a dime a dozen, and the ability to make a successful biopic depends largely on who you're making the biopic of, who it's fanbase of the loved public figure is, and whether or not you want to please that fanbase or tick them off. ""The Queen"" chooses the middle road in this final decision, which was a risky move on the film makers part, but one that pays off nicely. ""The Queen"" is a fictional story of the events that take place after Princess Diana's untimely death. After a series of news clips that show Diana behaving questionably, we then cut to a servant waking up Prince Philip and letting him know that Diana has been killed in a car crash. The newly appointed prime minister Tony Blair is quick to make a statement about Diana's death, uttering his famous quote ""she was the people's princess.""After his statement, Blair goes to the royals and asks if they would like to say anything publicly about Diana's death. Queen Elizabeth II (Helen Mirren, in a role that is sure to win her a Best Actress award come Oscar time) refuses, stating ""no member of the royale family will comment on the Princesses death."" The royals no longer consider Diana part of the royal family, remembering her as a woman who partied too much, had public affairs, and was an overall headache. Besides, the death of a family member is a ""personal family affair, and the public will understand that."" Too bad for the Queen, but the public doesn't respond well to the silence at all. They eagerly await a public acknowledgment from their queen, and are furious at the silence of the royals. When the royals refuse to hang their flag down to acknowledge the loss of a loved one, tempers flair even more.The media prints news article after news article, condemning the royals for their silence, while the Prince just mumbles about how rude the people are being. ""They talk as if they were the one's who knew her,"" he says angrily. ""To them she was a saint, to us she was a nuisance."" Blair has a public relations nightmare as he tries to calm Britains anger, but finds himself in popular light where everyone is in favor of destroying the monarchy in favor of a new government (preferably with Blair in it). The royals themselves don't come off as cruel, selfish people, but rather as people who are controlled by tradition and time. The world has evolved greatly since Queen Elizabeth II began her ruling, where she once was the Queen, but now is the Queen in name only. She does not interact with people outside of the castle and royal grounds, and simply cannot relate to the peoples outrage.As the week goes on, we feel sad for her when she loses sleep at night, feeling hurt and rejected by her people. She can't even begin to figure out why they hate her so much. Is it too much to ask for some privacy when mourning the loss of a family member? Was Diana still considered a family member when the royal family rejected her a few years ago? If she is not, then why is it her responsibility to make a statement? When she discovers that Diana's funeral will be attended by celebrities, she wonders whether or not people will be watching Diana's funeral as if it were the circus. Compared to Prince Philips, who openly shows a lot of resentment towards Diana, Queen Elizabeth II truly comes off as someone who cares about the situation, but just doesn't know what to do about it. Even Prince Charles urges her to make a statement, though he certainly doesn't completely understand what his mother is going thru.When Queen Elizabeth II finally does exit the castle to be with her people while they mourn, she is shocked and touched by how much love and emotion she feels from her people. Her eyes swell up with tears, as if she was feeling what it was like to be a true queen again for the first time in years. There was a whole world she was missing full of love and compassion, and it was waiting for her if she would just go outside once in awhile. Even Tony Blair, who receives the full blow of the ripple effect caused by the royals silence, begins to understand where the Queen is coming from. When his wife encourages Blair to just let the Queen ""hang herself,"" Blair frowns at her and says ""You don't understand, this is six hundred years of tradition she's throwing away.""Yes the royals made a mistake, but maybe it wasn't a mistake. Maybe it was a miscalculation. The royals certainly couldn't have predicted what silence would mean to Britain, and they were unprepared for the backlash they received. Maybe they just didn't understand the situation in the first place? Maybe we didn't take the time to understand their feelings, or wonder what their situation was? Maybe it was a combination of all the above? Regardless what the situation was, it was all worth it for a little bit more understanding of each other.

647661,A27H9DOUGY9FOS,B00005JPAM,"K. Harris ""Film aficionado""","[3, 3]","""The Queen"" is an absolutely captivating bit of modern history, one told with much restraint and nuance. Director Stephen Frears has taken a potentially controversial subject and instead of playing up the unsavory aspects, going for easy emotion, or turning it into a melodrama--he has crafted an intelligent study of tradition, duty and obligation. This is a complicated look into a tragedy that had no precedent but ultimately redefined much of modern England.Initially, as we meet the Royal family, we see that protocol, rules and tradition dictate their lives. Every meeting, every meal, every interaction has a designated way of being conducted. This is simply the way things are handled, how they've always been handled and how they are supposed to be handled. The death of Princess Diana was not something that could ultimately fit within these prescribed dictates.  Diana, who was divorced from Charles, was no longer a member of the Royal family. In fact, she was seeing someone else. Creating much publicity and speaking openly against the monarchy and for reform, she was a nuisance that had to be addressed frequently. The family, upon hearing of her death, were concerned with the children naturally but gave little thought to anything else. They felt Diana's death was a private matter for her family. The Queen followed appropriate protocol at all times.The public never saw that distinction, however, and that's the heart of the picture. Tony Blair, the new prime Minister, correctly gauges the sorrow of the nation. And the drama of the film comes from seeing the Queen recognize just how beloved Diana was and seeing her people turn on her. She must compromise her values and beliefs to placate the country. She questions what she has always known and her own validity. It may be an unsympathetic outward appearance, but every concession takes its toll on the very foundation of her world.Helen Mirren is simply stunning as the Queen. Regal and unflinching, she is also deeply human. Betrayed by the very country she has dedicated her life to, there are glimmers of real heartbreak. But she never loses control.  This isn't an emotional performance, it's restrained and skillfully underplayed. And there is a surprising amount of humor to this portrait of Elizabeth. Michael Sheen as Tony Blair is also exemplary. He is the film's heart and passion and it's a star-making performance.Somehow, ""The Queen"" gets you to understand and empathize with every side of this tragedy. Its greatest asset is its evenhandedness and fairness, and I recommend this as an insightful telling of a history stilled lodged in our memories.

The first event is the election of Tony Blair as Great Britian's Prime Minister and the second event is the death of Lady Di in Paris. This movie is a glittering, compelling, solemnly anxious news comedy of how the Royal family reacted to her Diana's death. The Queen, Prince Philip, Mother Queen and Prince Charles, all in their own ways, disliked Diana for what she had done to them, which was to turn the public love from the royals to her (Diana). The Queen's intentions are honorable because she wanted to protect her grandsons from the hounds of the media because she believed focusing too much on Diana's death would aggravate their grief. The Queen can't help how she feels, she was being the way she was raised, keeping things to herself, maintaining the immemorial English stiff upper lip.The Brits are known for their toughness and for being rational people. These are the same people that bravely stared Hitler in the face and survived his days of terror during WW2. Its that quality (that bulldog-ness effect) that has earned the British people respect from around the world. Its my opinion that the British was ready to cry that faithful week in 1997. For so long in their long history, they held back public tears, but the loss of Diana tugged at their heartstrings and they cried (in public). This caught the Queen by surprise as she must have realized her people have changed. It was up to Tony Blair to convince the Queen she must change too (in some areas).Helen Mirron is simply extraordinary. She made you feel the queens's pain, agony, and confusion. James Cromwell is a wonderful actor and his protrayal of Prince Phillip as a selfish nincompoop (well, that is true to form) is funny and brilliant. Michael Sheen bears a close resemblance to a younger Tony Blair, and has clearly studied him closely in order to catch his every gesture and nuance. I was not, however, particularly impressed by his performance because he seemed to mimic Blair rather than take the essence of Blair and act him out. The Queen Mother comes across as a bit of a drunk and a selfish woman. Cherie Blair, who would like to see the destruction of everything British, is admirably shown. However, the worst performance of the movie goes to Alex Jennings's Prince Charles because at times he seemed the most sympathetic of the Royals, at others weak and cowardly.Near the end of the film, it is clear the Queen and Blair relationship has warmed and they both have a great deal of respect for each other.

Her portrayal was very believable and sympathetic, as she showed a woman who, in the words of my dad, ""thought she was popular with the people, but found out that she wasn't nearly as popular as Diana, and that really shook her.""This movie is absorbing, thoughtful, revealing... and ironic. It's entitled ""The Queen,"" a title which would imply that it would cover the life of Elizabeth. In fact, this movie primarily covers a single week in her very long life as queen. And then, at the end of the movie, Tony Blair basically tells her that the week of Diana's death would just be a blip in people's memories - that people would remember Elizabeth for all of the things she'd done in her lifetime as queen, and not just for her reaction to Diana's death.

As Elizabeth clearly distains the Princess and finds her death just one more in a series of irritations, she wants to keep the mourning and funeral of her former daughter-in-law private.  Blair, however, thinks that would harm the monarchy in the eyes of the people who loved Diana, and urges the queen to go to London to speak publicly, fly a flag at half-mast over Buckingham Palace, and be seen grieving.  Though she despises public displays of emotion, she reluctantly agrees.Mirren gives a flawless impersonation of Elizabeth and James Cromwell is equally fine as grumpy Prince Phillip.  Sheen gives a sympathetic performance as Tony Blair, a young man who hopes to bring the monarchy into the modern age.  The palatial sets are grand and the ""behind the scenes"" peek at the Queen's private life is certainly enjoyable, but, as a non-Brit, I found the plot rather inconsequential and pointless.

647666,A2NJO6YE954DBH,B00005JPAM,Lawrance M. Bernabo,"[3, 4]","Helen Mirren's performance as Queen Elizabeth II is as finely nuanced a performance as you are likely to see in a motion picture.  ""The Queen"" who suffers the woeful ignorance regarding protocol of her new prime minister, Tony Blair (Michael Sheen,) at Buckingham Palace is not the same woman we see with her family is their retreat at Balmoral any more than that is the same woman who jumps into her old jeep and takes off on her own at the family's Scottish estate.  But the point is that they are the same woman and while the differences between those facets might be ones of minute degree, Mirren has captured them exquisitely, which is why she is now the greatest favorite to win the Oscar in the history of handicapping the Academy Awards.Written by Peter Morgan (whose ""The Last King of Scotland"" is probably going to win the Oscar for Best Actor) and directed by Stephen Frears (""Dangerous Liaisons""), this 2006 nominee for Best Picture is primarily about the week following the death of Diana, Princess of Wales, in 1997.  For the Queen the death of Diana is a private matter and the fact that Diana was no longer an HRH dictates the crown say nothing even more than a desire not to feed the media frenzy that played a role in her death.  But for Blair (with the help of his speech writer), Diana is the ""People's Princess,"" and he can see the threat to the monarchy by the Queen's silence in the face of this national tragedy even if her majesty cannot.  It is the middle class Blair, the first Labour PM in a generation, who has to persuade Elizabeth that her traditional quiet dignity, which has served her so well for a half century as Queen of England, is woefully inadequate to the moment at hand.The flaws of the film are not questions of movie making but exist because of fidelity to the events of that week.  In the immediate wake of Diana's death the paparazzi who relentlessly pursued her are vilified, but when the tabloid rags that paid for all those photographs of the princess turn the growing wrath of the public away from themselves and onto the royal family nobody calls them on their self-serving interests.  If Elizabeth, Charles and the rest of the family thought it was wrong to take the young princes away from Balmoral and back to the circus in London it is hard to fault them for their logic (if they had been at Buckingham palace they might have fled to Balmoral anyhow).  The whole point about lowering a flag that is only flown when the monarch is in residence, a tradition followed for four hundred years, still bothers me.  The flag was not lowered to half-mast for Queen Victoria or Winston Churchill, so the idea that it should be lowered for anybody still strikes me as being wrong.  Still, ""The Queen"" makes it clear that if there had been more from the monarch early on, there would have been less required as a public ""mea culpa"" later.For me the villain of the piece is Blair's wife, Cherie (Helen McCrory), who grins idiotically when performing a ""shallow"" curtsey in the presence of the Queen and takes glee in what is happening to the monarchy.  It takes most of the film, but eventually it is Blair himself who has to articulate why the woman sitting on the throne deserves respect if not loyalty.  I doubt that most Americans even know of the young Elizabeth Windsor who was an auto mechanic during World War II, when she and her mother and sister stayed in London during the Blitz, while thousands of other young children were being sent out of town (as see in the opening of ""The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe"").  Those of us who know of how Fate intervened to put this woman on the throne can only look at Cherie Blair and observe that Elizabeth did more for her country as a teenager than the prime minister's wife has done in her entire life.It is interesting to see how the funeral itself is reduced to almost an epilogue, although there is still a key scene to come afterwards.  Although it seem to be on point the moment where Elizabeth and the royal family stood at the gate of Buckingham palace and bowed their heads is omitted, as are such memorable moments as Elton John singing a new version of ""Candle in the Wind"" or the card to ""Mummy"" that Harry put on his mother's coffin.  For this film all that matters is that the Queen sits in Westminster and listens to Diana's brother laud his dead sister, extolling her as true royalty, because even once she gets her wake up call, the Queen has to have her nosed rubbed in it one more time.  Mirren's Elizabeth might be wrong in her reaction to the death of Diana, but once again the fault lies with Fate and not with the heart of a queen who has served her subjects the way she was taught long ago and once upon a time when she had been the princess of her people.Mirren must be looking forward to Oscar night when she will only have to give one acceptance speech rather than two, since at both the Golden Globes and the Screen Actors Guild Awards she won not only the top actress award for a movie for ""The Queen"" but also for her performance in ""Elizabeth I"" on television.  I have no doubt that each performance enhances the other in the minds of voters since the two Elizabeths certainly evince the range of Mirren's acting abilities (and both have her delivering speeches actually given by each monarch, which appeals to me as a rhetorician).  Mirren's acceptance speeches to date have been exemplary in being short and to the point, suggesting that some of the gravitas of her character may well have rubbed off on her.",5,"Helen Mirren's

647671,A17FLA8HQOFVIG,B00005JPAM,Linda Linguvic,"[0, 0]","This 2006 film tells the story of those dark days in 1997 when Princess Diana was tragically killed in a car crash and the world mourned the loss.  Queen Elizabeth, however, did not react immediately.  Because of the scandal surrounding the Princess's divorce from Prince Charles, royal protocol ruled, and there was a conspicuous silence from Buckingham Palace.In the role that won her the Academy Award, Helen Mirren's Queen Elizabeth seems absolutely real. Something magical happens and she actually ""becomes"" her royal highness herself.  It's not just that she looks like her; it's much more than that.  She has mastered the accent, the nuances, and the fleeting emotion in a self-controlled countenance.  She is also humbled and confused but this only comes through in fleeting moments of personal soul searching.  Otherwise, she embodies proper behavior as befits the tradition of the monarchy.Michael Sheen is cast in the role of Prime Minister Tony Blair and the early scenes depict his awkwardness in the presence of the Queen of England.  As the story progresses, however, he actually helps her to understand that the world has changed in the fifty years since she was crowned. This is all done very subtlety and I couldn't help be moved by the Queen's personal turmoil.There were strengths in the screenplay and but there were also weaknesses.

It pretty clear by this movie that without Blair, Elizabeth would have suffered major damages to her reputation and name. She owed him a great deal for his services toward her. (Maybe a future knighthood or peerage might even the honor.)Helen Mirren proves to be totally superb in her role. Was there any doubt of her Oscar? She was probably the only sure bet to win. Her performance nailed Elizabeth II right on the money and managed to conveyed the queen's actions and moods following Diana's death. In some way, the real queen owed her a great debt for portarying such a sensitive role. Mirren was well supported by her supporting cast, great script and sublime directing.

In an era where royalty is long out of vogue, the British royals seem not to have noticed.  They think they are beyond human beings.  The Queen cares less for Diana's tragic young death than for a poor stag that's been shot in the mountains.  She's either gone senile or she's batty.  Her husband is even worse as an arrogant, snob who makes crass remarks when he hears of Diana's death.The fact that their son was responsible for the break up of his marriage to Diana because of his adulterous relationship with a married woman and his jealousy over Diana's raport with the people  shows an insensitivity on the royals part beyond belief.  In a family who should have held their spoiled son responsible for Diana's troubles, blamed him only for not keeping her feelings over his infidelity under wraps.  While the country was in grief, the royals snubbed them, looking down upon their so called subjects with no feeling whatsoever.  Charles was not the only one whose marriage broke up.  As I recall the Queen's sister was also divorced, and her other son, Andrew divorced Fergie, so they have little to be proud of in family matters.It's a very good movie and a good reason to get rid of old time royalty.  They should disperse their unbelievabe billions in cash, land, homes and jewels and give it back to their people from whence it came and settle down in a cottage somewhere in the Scottish Highlands.

647680,A1TWTULVD6F22O,B00005JPAM,"L. Quido ""quidrock""","[3, 4]","""The Queen""  is, far and away, Stephen Frears' best film to date.  That's saying a lot since his ""Dangerous Liasions"" is one of my favorite films of all time.  While ""Dangerous Liasions"" is about power and cruelty,  The Queen allows you a glimpse behind the scenes of power, and illustrates that everyone, no matter how famous or how powerful, stumbles a little in life, and fortunately has a person or persons around them  that save them from themselves.A study in contrasts of style and substance is the theme of the film -- the events that brought together Queen Elizabeth II (Helen Mirren) and her new Prime Minister, Tony Blair (Michael Sheen).  Had it not been for the sudden, almost inexplicable death of the tragic Princess Diana, followed by the schism in terms of reaction between her people and the Queen, Elizabeth and Tony may have taken years to get comfortable with one another, years to understand each other, years to forge the kind of relationship that works for the UK.These two actors are brilliant in their roles.  Mirren goes beyond the traditional caricature of the Queen as stodgy, opinionated, and totally in control/disdain of her family members' lives and foibles.  She gives us the Queen as an extraordinary woman made humble by events she did not create and could not fathom.  Her reaction to them, her eventual awareness and response, is, for lack of a better word, queenly.  Mirren, the redoubtable Jane Tennyson of the brilliant ""Prime Suspect"" series, is the best actress of her time (yes, Meryl Streep, that includes you).  Michael Sheen, on the other hand, may not portray Tony Blair as he really is (how would I know?) but the contrast of his coltish, disarming charm and his leadership style at the beginning of his term as Prime Minister (and the obvious affection from staff and family,  for his ability to be real, to be the kind of leader that one would follow into hell )  to his growing confidence that he can, by the truth of his understanding and  his willingness to continue to persevere, to bring the tragedy from the brink, all of it is captured in his performance.Frears benefits from a brilliant script by Peter Morgan, but turns the script into an extraordinary film by the perfection of his choices and his editing.  He chooses to recreate scenes that have never been filmed (the crowd in front of the hotel before Diana emerged to her car and her subsequent death the scene of Charles arriving at the hospital) and mixes them with real film clips of Diana in life, and some of the real film of the funeral events.  Choosing NOT to recreate Diana with an actress was sheer genius, and the mix of clips and live action was incredibly well done.  Mixing the filmmaker's/writer's interpretation of what must have happened in the series of entreating phone calls between Blair and the Queen, making both vulnerable by showing little shots of daily life -- the cozy, contemporary chaos of the Blair house, the deliberacy of the Queen taking off and putting on her glasses, tells the story of how the power shifted between them (perhaps?) in a way that not even his fine actors could do.  Choosing  a breathtaking but not imposing score for the film and making the shots of Balmoral ( the almost forbidding surroundings) come to life as the barrier between the Queen and her people...well, Frear has taken what could be an ordinary, dull film about a living monarch to the realms of an incredible character study, played out against a backdrop that stands stark in the memory of people all over the world.Was the crown really endangered by Elizabeth's reaction to the tragedy?  Did she change her stance because of the leverage of Blair's campaign, his truth?  Is Frears film opinion, or is it reality?  Somewhere in the middle?  It matters not.  It's unique, it's powerful, it's a shame that it won't be viewed in wider release, because it is the best film, so far, this year.",5,A study in contrasts,1162684800,"11 5, 2006",2006,3923,"['Queen', 'far', 'away', 'Stephen', 'Frears', 'best', 'film', 'date', 'saying', 'lot', 'Dangerous', 'Liasions', 'one', 'favorite', 'films', 'time', 'Dangerous', 'Liasions', 'power', 'cruelty', 'Queen', 'glimpse', 'scenes', 'power', 'everyone', 'matter', 'how', 'famous', 'how', 'powerful', 'little', 'life', 'fortunately', 'person', 'persons', 'save', 'themselves.A', 'study', 'contrasts', 'style', 'substance', 'theme', 'film', 'events', 'brought', 'together', 'Queen', 'Elizabeth', 'II', 'Helen', 'Mirren', 'new', 'Prime', 'Minister', 'Tony', 'Blair', 'Michael', 'Sheen', 'Had', 'not', 'been', 'sudden', 'almost', 'inexplicable', 'death', 'tragic', 'Princess', 'Diana', 'followed', 'schism', 'terms', 'reaction', 'people', 'Queen', 'Elizabeth', 'Tony', 'may', 'have', 'taken', 'years', 'get', 'comfortable', 'one', 'years', 'understand', 'other', 'years', 'forge', 'kind', 'relationship', 'UK.These', 'two', 'actors', 'are', 'brilliant', 'roles', 'Mirren', 'traditional', 'caricature', 'Queen', 'stodgy', 'opinionated', 'totally', 'control/disdain', 'family', 'members', 'lives', 'foibles', 'Queen', 'extraordinary', 'woman', 'made', 'humble', 'events', 'did', 'not', 'create', 'could', 'not', 'fathom', 'reaction', 'eventual', 'awareness', 'response', 'lack', 'better', 'word', 'queenly', 'Mirren', 'redoubtable', 'Jane', 'Tennyson', 'brilliant', 'Prime', 'Suspect', 'series', 'best', 'actress', 'time', 'yes', 'Meryl', 'Streep', 'Michael', 'Sheen', 'other', 'hand', 'may', 'not', 'portray', 'Tony', 'Blair', 'really', 'how', 'would', 'know', 'contrast', 'coltish', 'disarming', 'charm', 'leadership', 'style', 'beginning', 'term', 'Prime', 'Minister', 'obvious', 'affection', 'staff', 'family', 'ability', 'be', 'real', 'be', 'kind', 'leader', 'one', 'would', 'follow', 'hell', 'growing', 'confidence', 'can', 'truth', 'understanding', 'willingness', 'continue', 'persevere', 'bring', 'tragedy', 'brink', 'captured', 'performance.Frears', 'benefits', 'brilliant', 'script', 'Peter', 'Morgan', 'script', 'extraordinary', 'film', 'perfection', 'choices', 'editing', 'recreate', 'scenes', 'have', 'never', 'been', 'filmed', 'crowd', 'front', 'hotel', 'Diana', 'emerged', 'car', 'subsequent', 'death', 'scene', 'Charles', 'arriving', 'hospital', 'mixes', 'real', 'film', 'clips', 'Diana', 'life', 'real', 'film', 'funeral', 'events', 'Choosing', 'NOT', 'recreate', 'Diana', 'actress', 'was', 'sheer', 'genius', 'mix', 'clips', 'live', 'action', 'was', 'incredibly', 'well', 'done', 'Mixing', ""filmmaker's/writer"", 'interpretation', 'what', 'must', 'have', 'happened', 'series', 'entreating', 'phone', 'calls', 'Blair', 'Queen', 'making', 'vulnerable', 'showing', 'little', 'shots', 'daily', 'life', 'cozy', 'contemporary', 'chaos', 'Blair', 'house', 'deliberacy', 'Queen', 'taking', 'off', 'putting', 'glasses', 'story', 'how', 'power', 'shifted', 'perhaps', 'way', 'not', 'even', 'fine', 'actors', 'could', 'do', 'Choosing', 'breathtaking', 'not', 'imposing', 'score', 'film', 'making', 'shots', 'Balmoral', 'almost', 'forbidding', 'surroundings', 'come', 'life', 'barrier', 'Queen', 'people', 'well', 'Frear', 'taken', 'what', 'could', 'be', 'ordinary', 'dull', 'film', 'living', 'monarch', 'realms', 'incredible', 'character', 'study', 'played', 'out', 'backdrop', 'stark', 'memory', 'people', 'world.Was', 'crown', 'really', 'endangered', 'Elizabeth', 'reaction', 'tragedy', 'Did', 'change', 'stance', 'leverage', 'Blair', 'campaign', 'truth', 'Frears', 'film', 'opinion', 'reality', 'Somewhere', 'middle', 'not', 'unique', 'powerful', 'shame', 'wo', ""n't"", 'be', 'viewed', 'wider', 'release', 'best', 'film', 'so', 'far', 'year']",The Queen

This movie was a boring, shallow portrayal of all involved. I watched the first thirty minutes hoping it would live up to the hype, the second thirty minutes were spent wondering why I was still watching it, and finally I came to my senses and ejected it. Charles is portrayed sympathetically? He was shown as a sniveling whiney person who was afraid to call the PM himself. The only interesting thing in the part that I watched was when Queen E put Tony Blair in his place by telling him he was her tenth PM, and that Winston Churchill had sat in that chair and had offerred her useful advice.

I saw ""The Queen"" several times when it was released, and now I own the DVD, which I have also watched on many occasions.  What invariably happens is that we see a scene in a different light, we discern something that previously eluded us, or we radically change our perception of a character.  This suggests that the way we perceive all media is in constant flux, and that sometimes we are never quite certain about our judgments.For me, the more that I have seen ""The Queen,"" the less I am troubled by her (and her mother's and husband's) obliviousness and apparently stubborn and anachronistic behavior.  In the first viewings, I remember agreeing with Michael Sheen (who plays Blair superbly):  ""Will someone please save these people from themselves?!.""But after more viewings, I began to feel sorry for Elizabeth and viewed her as a victim of tradition, duty and the cloistered, myopic surroundings she lived in that seemed to cut her off from common sense and the changing, ""modern"" world (the word ""modern"" is a key concept in the film).  I began to feel compassion for her and felt that she was simply overwhelmed by events that she could not (rather than would not) comprehend.  (I think the movie attempts to engage our compassion, but in one instance it does so with an astonishingly inept and heavy-handed metaphor of Elizabeth compared to a noble stag at Balmoral that is relentlessly stalked and eventually killed.)  So, again, I agreed with Sheen:  ""That woman has given her whole life in service to her people.  Fifty years doing a job that she never wanted.  A job she watched kill her father.  She's executed it with honor, dignity, and as far as I can tell, without a single blemish, and now we're all baying for her blood.  All because she's struggling to lead the world in mourning for someone who threw everything she offered back in her face.  And who for the last few years, seemed committed 24/7 to destroying everything she holds most dear!""Recently, I happened to see on YouTube Elizabeth's actual 1997 speech on television from Buckingham Palace and compared it with Helen Mirren's same speech in the movie.  And then I started to question my judgment about my compassion for Elizabeth.That, I think, is the conflicting nature of this movie, and the remarkably layered performance that Mirren gives.

647688,A2D37EP9KT2E3D,B00005JPAM,"Mark bennett ""Mark""","[4, 8]","This is a film about what politicians and celebrities ""owe"" the public and the media. The message of the film is that it is the duty of a public figure to give ""the people"" what they want even if it doesn't necessarly reflect the actual emotions of the person in question.The film begins with the death of Princess Diana. Her death initiates a media circus and she is treated as a great person though in life she accomplished little other than getting lots of press coverage for herself. The politicians immediately make the rounds of the media programs, say all the right things and express the manipulative ""false"" emotions that press/public want to hear. But the royals themselves and especially the queen are not in front of the press making the expected over the top dramatic false emotional displays of ""grief"". They also don't immediately move back to the media center of London. In the film's view of things, these are ""bad"" things.The film, like many people today, assumes that there is ""one"" right way to show the emotion of grief and that such displays need to be made in front of the Cameras as quickly as possible. The idea that individuals have different ways of expressing emotion is lost in the self-help fed culture of amature experts. Phillip, for scheduling activities to take the children's mind off the tragedy is made out to be a ""monster"". But who is really the monster? Is it a man who attempts to keep children away from a media circus or is it the people who want to feed those children into the media circus?The queen and company not returning to London starts to ignite events in London. The press, unhappy at not getting the story they wanted, starts to fuel public opinion against the Queen. The politicians then start to see the unpopularity of the Queen as a drag on the popularity of their party and start putting pressure on. The people (and really the media as well) are demanding a public show of grief for Diana. The queen must give the people what they expect. The life and death of modern politics: Poll Numbers are dragged out as a reason why the Queen must make an over the top false public display of grief that she doesnt want to make. But she resists.Meanwhlie, the media has stirred up the crazies that follow on the edges of celebrity. The film tries hard to convince us that unbalanced people who express ""grief"" by putting ""they (the royals) have your blood on their hands"" are somehow normal people. Diana was a divorced woman who died in a traffic accident in Paris. What kind of person blames the ex-mother in law in ""blood on your hands"" terms? Thats crazy-talk. And yet the film treats it as a real expression of public opinion.More pressure is brought and finally the queen attempts to make a public statement herself. But in the most surreal moment of the film, the political PR people demand that the statement be rewritten so that the words ""sound human"". Incredibly, the film's message here is that a real message by a real human being sounds less human than text written by a bunch of Public relations hack writers.We live in an age where public moments and public emotions are scripted. Where the words and feelings of real people don't sound human to many of us anymore and where we demand (as the film does) made-for-tv moments of false grief. And if we don't get them, the person responsible must be destroyed.The Queen makes the statement. The media and press get what they want. The politicians get what they want. And ""the people"" seem to get what they want. But the question I was left with was why the statement was necessary. Why do public figures ""owe"" the media or ""the people"" anything?  And what especially do they owe the public emotional displays that are often false?This film is a message film. It is blatently one-side and manipulative. It is all the worse because it uses real people who are still alive to make its points. Some people do extraordinarily well in the film as to their portrayal. Others are played almost as charactures.The message the film wants to present is that the old ""out of touch"" royals need to modernize themselves. The message that the film unintentionally presents is that modern public life is entirely fake and driven by the stories the media decide to present. If you give the media the story they want, you are a good person and they will treat you well. If you don't give them what they want, they will fill the newsprint and airtime with attacks on you.According to the film's thinking, the right reaction for a Queen on hearing of Diana's death would have been to rush off to consult public relations experts and get everyone in front of the TV cameras as quickly as possible. Regardless of real emotions, they should have acted out film or television movie ""grief"". Everything and every word would have been scripted and planned out with regard to media coverage day by day until the funeral.The film might have been better if it had dealt with the broader implications of events and been less one-sided. But it didn't. The iconic moment of the movie is when the speechwriters come in to change the words of a real person to make them sound ""more human"". There is so much wrong with that, words fail.",3,fraud in modern life,1177027200,"04 20, 2007",2007,5214,"['film', 'what', 'politicians', 'celebrities', 'owe', 'public', 'media', 'message', 'film',

647690,A36EW68H08UOCS,B00005JPAM,"Mark J. Fowler ""Let's Play Two!""","[5, 6]","Helen Mirren won the Academy Award for her portrayal of HRH Elizabeth II with a performance that knocked me out.  Her small nuances and gestures and even her walk easily evoke Her Majesty - the one in my public mind.  As the film progresses we're privy to behind locked door scenes that are only the speculation of Director Stephen Frears and Alan Morgan - but they fit in perfectly with what we think we know about the house of Mountbatten-Windsor.  In the emotional final act, Dame Mirren's performance becomes even more remarkable as she gives us a brief glimpse into the humanity of the woman never seen by the public eye.Michael Sheen gives an equally impressive supporting performance as Prime Minister Tony Blair, who as the film opens has just been elected from the Labor Party in a landslide after eighteen years of Conservatives. (Blair's predecessors John Major and Margaret Thatcher aren't mentioned.) The Queen and her advisors are in preparation for Mr. Blair's promise to shake things up when tragedy strikes.For those too young to remember the effect that the unexpected death of Lady Diana had on the world - ""Princess Di"" married Prince Charles, the Prince of Wales and future King of England, while she was a teenager and Charles was in his thirties.  The Prince has a reputation for being very properly British - stiff upper lip and all that - and somewhat detached from the ""real world"" while Diana hung out with rock stars and made conspicuous public appearances that made her maybe the world's most famous celebrity.  They were married fifteen years, had two sons, and divorced a year before her death in Paris - her car speeding in a narrow tunnel, trying to flee paparazzi.  For the twelve-year old reader: if Anna Nicole had intelligence, charm, character, and had devoted years of her life to world-wide charitable causes like the fight against AIDS and land-mines, after being married to the future King of England, well... you get the idea.Anyway - back to the film.  Diana and Charles have been divorced for a year, and when she is killed she is no longer ""Her Royal Highness, the Princess of Wales"".  In addition, the media attention around Diana and her split from Charles has not been flattering to the Royals.  When Elizabeth is told that Diana's family, the Spencers, want to have a private funeral, the Queen is satisfied with that.  She doesn't want a big ""to-do"" and, after all, it's what her family wanted.  A recurrent theme in the film is how badly the Queen and her advisors initially underestimate the national and world-wide outpouring of grief over Diana's tragic death.The royal family is on holiday at the massive estate at Balmoral.  While the Queen is away the flag doesn't fly over Buckingham Palace.  But mourners are lining up outside the Palace and leaving flowers and keep-sakes outside the royal gates and Prime Minister Blair correctly senses that the British people think that the Queen and her family should return to London and fly the flag at half-mast.Elizabeth worked for the British Military transportation during World War II and when her father died and she became Queen in 1952, her first Prime Minister was Winston Churchill.  Her Majesty is ""old school"", and she knows protocol.  Her subjects are demanding a degree of Royal respect and honor which she knows that she would not receive if she were to die herself.  She wants to shield her grandsons from the brouhaha in London - it's bad enough that they've lost their mother, isn't it?James Cromwell gives a great performance as the Queen's husband, Prince Phillip, and Sylvia Syms gets many of the best lines as the Queen Mother. Alex Jennings looks a little bit like Prince Charles - from behind - and he gives a good performance that shows that Charles had strong feelings for Diana a year after their divorce.The best scenes take place between the Prime Minister and Her Majesty - some of them phone conversations.  A subtle, but plainly growing, degree of respect develops between the two of them as they both realize that the other is behaving in a way that is perfectly understandable.

The English King, Henry II, was flogged for his role in the death of Becket, the archbishop of Canterbury. The German emperor, Henry IV, had to march around the papal palace in sack cloth and ashes for his misdeeds. Ironicaly, the Queen is the head of the Church of England but she has to answer to an authority even more capricous and mercurial than popes...public opinion as shaped by superficial celebrity-worshipping media coverage. People love hero/bad guy stories so when Princess Di died, the press was busy turning her into a saint and the royal family into cads. Never mind the complicating factors that there had been a very nasty recent divorce with Di running to the press spilling out intimate details of their lives that we had no business knowing, the public wanted to see the Queen blubber and cry on TV like some guest on the Jerry Springer show. I have a feeling Queen Elizabeth would have gladly traded penances with Henry II and been flogged at the tomb of Thomas Becket instead.  Elizabeth came from a generation that valued emotional restraint in the face of calamity. When John Kennedy died, the thing everyone praised was Jackie's calm dignity.

647698,A3KEZLJ59C1JVH,B00005JPAM,Melissa Niksic,"[6, 6]","Helen Mirren won an Academy Award for her performance as Elizabeth II in ""The Queen,"" which depicts the British monarch's reaction to the death of Princess Diana in the summer of 1997. Prime Minister Tony Blair (played brilliantly by Michael Sheen) had just recently been elected at the time of Diana's death, and he was still in the process of determining the best way to forge a successful working relationship with the queen. This film deals with Windsor's fall from grace the week after Diana's death, when the queen refused to follow the prime minister's advice on how to best handle the situation to meet the needs of the grieving British public.At first the queen refuses to take Blair's advice about making any kind of public statement, preferring to remain silent in hopes that the former Princess of Wales would be laid to rest quickly and quietly, without any fanfare. However, the public's frustration grows and Elizabeth faces opposition from the government as well as from her son Charles (Alex Jennings). Soon it becomes clear that the royal family's inaction may wind up being their ultimate demise, and the queen is forced to come to terms with her own emotions and make one of what was surely many difficult choices during her reign.I think this film is brilliant. The cast is absolute perfection, and it's very clear why Mirren received an Oscar for her portrayal as a queen struggling to come to terms with her own personal beliefs and the realization that she doesn't always understand the needs of her people. I also appreciated the way the film handled the treatment of Diana herself. Although the plot of the movie revolves around Diana's death, it's handled gracefully and with dignity. Instead of casting an actress to play the princess, the film relied on a steady peppering of news clips showing the real Diana herself, which was thoughtful and effective.On one hand, ""The Queen"" depicts a monarchy that is cold and completely out of touch with modern day society. However, although I didn't always agree with Elizabeth's choices, it was easy to sympathize with her position and understand where she was coming from when she made certain decisions. Regardless of her personal feelings toward the late princess, the queen's belief that quiet dignity should be maintained before caving in to public spectacle is a very good point.I highly recommend this movie to everyone, if for no other reason than that Mirren portrays Elizabeth II with more humanity than most people might believe is possible.

I really didn't have very high expectations for this movie - I shouldn't have had any.The film revolves around the time of Princess Diana's death and the royal family's reaction to it. The movie covers the span of about one week, though I think the director tried to do it in real time. This movie is just far, far too long for the material covered. How long and how many times must the audience be subjected to Blair stating Queen must ""do something"" publically, Queen refuses, Blair again states Queen should ""do something publically, Queen refuses, ad nauseum? And, in between, we are once again shown the same old tired film clips of Diana from years before. Dull, dull, dull!As for acting? What acting might that be? I've heard wonderful things about Helen Mirren dipicting Queen Elizabeth II, but I just didn't see it. She played the Queen as the same stereotypical, dowdy, dry monarch that many perceive. Although many kudos to the hair and makeup team - they did excel, but an actress has no control over that. Mirren captured none of Queen Elizabeth II's grace, sense of duty, true love for her nation and people, and - most important - her wry sense of humor. Mirren simply played a dowdy old woman.As for Sheen? I caught none of the spark that is Tony Blair. Rather, all I picked up was a hyperactive puppy, bouncing after important people's coattails and trying to impress the media.I do have to admit the best line in the movie was delivered when the Queen told Blair upon first meeting that he was her 10th Prime Minister and that her first had been Winston Churchill. The irony is she will soon be facing her 11th Prime Minister. Anyone wonder if she will meet a 12th or 13th?I'm puzzled by the overwhelming number of 5 star ratings here. I wonder that most people avoided nodding off as I did in more than one spot. Perhaps individuals who absolutly loved Diana? Or thought that the conversations between the royals were ""real"" and they got the true story? (As if anyone would actually know?) Simply just for Mirren's performance?

Strangely her death hit me pretty hard as if she were a part of my immediate circle of family and friends.What had Diana meant to me and to millions around the world? And why did we all take her death so personally?Stephan Frears' ""The Queen"" doesn't deal with these Diana questions much but her death is the engine that pulls this film along to its inevitable conclusion. What he does deal with is Queen Elizabeth's (a perfectly stiff-upper lipped Helen Mirren...a performance without irony and definitely one of respect) reaction, or more to the point, non-reaction to Diana's death.Frears, best known for edgy dramas as in the terrific ""The Grifters"" and ""My Beautiful Launderette"" directs here with restraint and reverence which in most cases would translate to stodgy and dull. But Frears, ever the consummate artist treats the material with panache, taking advantage of the political, social and emotional nature of this situation to elevate the material to drama, riveting dramaIn 1997, Tony Blair (a dull, odd, Michael Sheen) had just been elected on a platform of change and modernism and meets with a wall that is the implacable Queen and the Royal family who are intent on adhering to tradition which meant that Diana, as no longer a member of the royal family, would not deserve a State funeral.

The movie focuses on the death of Princess Diana and how the Royal family behaved during the period immediately after.The movie portrayed Elizabeth as someone who stuck to tradition (heavily influenced by her mother) and had faith that by sticking to tradition, the public at large would come around and see that she was right.  Unfortunately those traditions were for a time past and no longer held in the Tabloid influenced world of today where celebrities are put under the microscope and all their actions are highly scrutinized.Besides Mirren, there were solid performances all around especially by the actor who played Tony Blair.  The director seemed to show that the two smartest people were Blair's and the Queen's personal assistants.

Smith,"[1, 1]","Watch this and it will be obvious why Helen Mirren won the Oscar for Best Actress for her remarkable portrayal of the seventy-year-old Elizabeth II, trying to cope with a world she no longer understands -- and doesn't really want to. The story line covers the week following the death in Paris of Princess Diana, which was also the very beginning of Tony Blair's decade as Labor Prime Minister. Many of those surrounding Blair (played very effectively by Michael Sheen) -- including his wife, Cherie -- were not sympathetic to anything about the Royal Family, whom they regarded as outmoded leeches on society. And while we will never know just how authentic Peter Morgan's first-rate script is, the viewer will come away convinced that Prince Philip and the Queen Mother, especially, had and have a 19th-century attitude of entitlement. Prince Charles comes off as a pathetic weakling, too, trying to sidle up to Blair for his own protection. Because of the Queen's insistence on ""privacy,"" her complete lack of understanding of the need of the public all around the world to mourn Diana, one quarter of the British people toward the end of that week were becoming convinced the monarchy should be abolished. (And that's my gripe with the real-world Blair, too: He had the chance to kill off the monarchy completely but he didn't take it. Instead, he converted to storybook royalism, a victim of mawkish sentimentality -- just as his wife warned him all prime ministers had done.)

647705,A39SJ6V6QCGC37,B00005JPAM,Midge,"[1, 6]","The movie was excellent... even for those of us who did not care for the way the Royal family treated Princess Di. Helen Mirren gave an Oscar winning, tasteful, believable performance. I also think the part of Philip was right on the nose. His malice and narrow minded, out of touch arrogance was perfectly portrayed in this movie. It was nice to see that his personality was not soft-soaped.The writing and portrayal of Tony Blair was very compelling. It seemed like most of the movie was angled from either his point of view or that of his advisers. The only problem I had with the acting on Blair's character was that the acting was a bit overdone like he was some wide eyed kid on his very first solo visit to a candy store.The hair wasn't quite right on Blair or Charles. It would have helped the feel of the movie if the hairdressers and makeup had done as good a job on them as they did on Helen Mirren for the role of the Queen. It would not have required much effort to comb their hair more like the persons they were portraying.The writers did well on all characters except Prince Charles. They didn't give the actor much to work with on lines. The writing fell flat on that character... even for Charles who's already a flat personality to begin with.Otherwise, it was a superb job of acting and writing.However, the director, Stephen Frears is an unkempt, ill-mannered, lowbrow slob in serious need of lessons in hygiene. He looks like some boozer from skid row. From his disheveled appearance, attitude, commentary and lack of personal hygiene, it is obvious that the actors and the writing team were the ones who made this movie so successful... not the director.It amazes me that anyone would hire this director, much less pay him a salary. All you need to do is watch the bonus material to see and hear what a swine this man is (on or off the set)... not to mention his bad manners, bad on-camera etiquette and slovenly appearance to go with his tasteless attitude. He didn't even have the decency to clean up for the DVD interview. On top of that he was frequently scratching and messing with his hair and face while on camera. He is the closest match to a human version of Homer Simpson I have ever seen. He spoke of someone looking like a clown... he should have looked in the mirror.Another person who had no business working on this particular film was Alan MacDonald, the production designer. He had the unmitigated audacity to declare on the bonus material interview, that the 4 billion people worldwide who were mourning Diana were all hysterical. He said it with such utter disdain and condescending attitude toward the billions of people... it was wholly offensive.Apparently, math and human compassion are not his forte... otherwise he would have realized that the person with the psychological shortcomings was himself... not the rest of the world. He made no contribution to this film that could not have been better done by any other production designer. Frankly, I would think twice about buying any future movie which either of these men are associated with. Their very presence spoils anything they are associated with. They would both be more at home in the low end of the adult film industry.But don't let that dissuade you on the film.

647707,A1FG91CM8221X1,B00005JPAM,Miles D. Moore,"[8, 10]","F. Scott Fitzgerald famously wrote, ""Let me tell you about the rich. They are different from you and I."" For the House of Windsor, that difference is magnified a hundredfold. Trained fastidiously to be the living representatives of a thousand years of British history, cocooned from everyday life by their station and privilege, the members of the Royal Family adopted a becoming public dignity and reserve that served them well in the dark days of the London Blitz. Unfortunately, that reserve doesn't play so well in the democratized Britain of the Information Age, which makes them appear cold and unlikable while simultaneously blowing the cover off the times when they, shall we say, strain against the bonds of royal protocol.  Stephen Frears' ""The Queen"" masterfully depicts the event that finally brought home to the Royal Family the power of the media and the people--the tragic death of Diana, Princess of Wales, in the late summer of 1997. Remembering Diana as a selfish, neurotic troublemaker, Queen Elizabeth II (Helen Mirren), Prince Philip (James Cromwell) and the Queen Mother (Sylvia Syms) have no conception of how beloved she was by the people, simply because she possessed the common touch the rest of them so conspicuously lack. Ensconced in luxurious isolation at Balmoral Castle, they maintain a starchy silence that new Prime Minister Tony Blair (Michael Sheen) recognizes immediately as a public relations catastrophe. Peter Morgan's superb screenplay details the frantic efforts of Blair to get the initially uncomprehending Elizabeth to reach out to her grieving subjects. While Philip and the Queen Mum pressure Elizabeth to stand her ground (Philip mocks the list of mourners at Diana's funeral as ""a chorus line of pop stars and homosexuals""), Blair's anti-monarchist wife Cherie (Helen McCrory) urges him to let the Royal Family hang itself publicly as ""a bunch of freeloading, anachronistic nutters."" This is one of the most involving stories of political machination ever put on film, and extraordinarily courageous in that it portrays still-living heads of state in ways that are sometimes far less than flattering (will Prince Philip dare sue?). All the performances are a resounding affirmation of the glories of British Rep (and in this I include Cromwell, the one American ringer in the cast). But the film stands or falls in its portrayal of Elizabeth, and with the wonderful, fabulous Helen Mirren playing her, it not only stands but soars. Mirren won the Best Actress Award at the Venice Film Festival for her performance, and if there's any justice she should start rehearsing her Oscar speech. Mirren is one of the great living masters in portraying deep emotion behind a dignified facade, and ""The Queen"" gives her an unprecedented opportunity to do just that. (Mirren's Elizabeth gives us the textbook definition of ""noblesse oblige:"" standing at the gates of Buckingham Palace, reading the placards that essentially accuse her of being Diana's murderer, she makes the slightest grimace of sorrow, then turns to the assembled crowd and smiles.) ""The Queen"" is simply one of the best films to come out of Britain in the last decade.

647708,A3UPYGJKZ0XTU4,B00005JPAM,mirasreviews,"[3, 3]","""The Queen"" chronicles the behind-the-scenes drama of the British royal family in the week following the death of Diana, Princess of Wales on the 30th of August 1997. Princess Diana' death plunges the monarchy into an unexpected crisis when public grief overflows into the streets and parks. Queen Elizabeth II (Helen Mirren) considers Diana's death a private affair and can't fathom her people's need for a public funeral or acknowledgement from the royal family: ""The less attention one draws to it, the better."" Labour Prime Minister Tony Blair (Michael Sheen), elected head of the government by a landslide just a few months before, understands what the public expects and the dangers of the monarchy not fulfilling that role: ""Will someone please save these people from themselves?"" So he advises, pleads, and cajoles the Queen into making a public tribute in the face of growing anti-monarchist sentiment.Helen Mirren won an Oscar for her portrayal of this monarch who keeps her feelings so much to herself that people tend to doubt that she has feelings. I'm not convinced myself, but ""The Queen"" offers an interesting perspective on Her Majesty's stoicism: Duty precludes her from ever being partial. She can't even vote. And she despised Princess Diana -with good reason- so was probably not anguished by her death. In presenting Diana's death from the perspective of the royal family, secluded at Balmoral Castle, the film tries to make the Queen a sympathetic figure, a bastion of traditional culture suddenly confronted with a celebrity culture that she does not understand. This does little in my mind to alleviate the fact that Queen Elizabeth II utterly lacks leadership skills, charisma, and is so uncomprehending of her own culture that she erodes the usefulness of the monarchy. But I have to admit that she -or her verisimilitude- is fascinating to watch.We also see the perspective of Tony Blair and his staff at 10 Downing Street on Princess Diana's death and that of the British public, who are represented by real television news footage. In fact, everyone is experiencing the crisis through television. The royals, the government, and the public spend a lot of time watching each other on TV. It's difficult to know where director Stephen Frears and writer Peter Morgan's sympathies lie, if anywhere. The events of ""The Queen"" resulted from the clash of three dysfunctional parties, though the film does not explicitly say so: mentally ill Princess Diana, emotionally stunted and out-of-touch Queen Elizabeth II, and the British people whose initial expressions of affection and grief quickly degenerated into an obscene display of self-pity.If you're wondering how screenwriter Stephen Marber knew what happened behind closed doors in the days following Princess Diana's death, he drew on his own sources inside 10 Downing Street and those of historian Robert Lacey inside Balmoral Castle. Mr. Lacey wrote the book ""Majesty"" about the reign of Elizabeth II and served as consultant on this film. Beside the obvious inability to know the precise content of private conversations, some liberties have been taken with the story, including the subplot involving the stag at Balmoral, which serves as metaphor. And a wonderful metaphor it is. ""The Queen"" is a sublimely insightful film that possesses more gravity than any of its dramatis personae would seem to merit alone.The DVD (Miramax 2007): There are a making-of documentary and 2 audio commentaries. ""The Making of The Queen"" (18 min) has 3 parts: the cast, director Stephen Frears, and other crew discuss the challenges of portraying real people; the environments of the film as created through production and costume designs; and crew members talk about their experiences of the week that Princess Diana died. The first audio commentary by director Stephen Frears and screenwriter Peter Morgan is sporadic and addresses a miscellany of topics without being informative. Skip it. The second audio commentary by historian Robert Lacey is excellent and very worthwhile if you enjoyed the film. Lacey discusses the film's themes of traditional vs celebrity culture and the perspective of the royals vs the public. He explains the context of events and the meaning of protocols. He tells us what is and is not based on fact as far as it could be ascertained, takes us through the actions of the characters, and explains the politics for us foreigners.

647710,A228JH8V9Y700G,B00005JPAM,MortensOrchid,"[3, 3]","I shall begin this review by saying that I was not an avid fan of Princess Diana.  I remember her very well when I was a child with the hubbub about the royal wedding, and she had always been one of the most prominent celebrities that I knew of.  It seems that at any one point in time someone was talking about Diana.  I said at some point that it was just celebrity garbage and fluff, and gave a big ""Who cares?"" about it.  But if I didn't care, why did I wake up my mom in the middle of the night on that faithful day in 1997 when she was killed in a car accident in Paris?  And watch the funeral on TV a few days later?I did not watch this movie based on a celebrity fascination with Diana or any other of the British royal family, but to see the true flow of relationship between the government houses.  Helen Mirren does a superior job of portraying Elizabeth II, refined and stiff upper lipped to the T.  At the same time, just weeks before, Tony Blair had been elected, the first time in years that the Labour Party had been appointed as Prime Minister.  It was also a very exciting time in England, as there was a sense of change with his election.  Just as Tony Blair was getting his feet wet in his new job, Diana is killed in a car accident.  The UK, let alone the rest of the world, was thrown into chaos.  We looked to the queen to make a statement, but she remained silent.This movie showed the tensions and conflict very well between the royals and the public.  Elizabeth had distain for Diana, to be sure, after the tabloid fiasco of her and Charles's divorce, so she wanted to remain silent.  From another generation of royalty and duty, she wanted to remain silent to show her respects; but, the public wanted to hear a statement as it's a different world now.  Plus having a new, enthusiastic Prime Minister pressuring her to adjust (I love that scene where they meet for the first time and she said ""Winston Churchhill sat in that very same chair"".), she had to say something.  And she did.The only critical words I have for this movie are for the portrail of Prince Charles.  I wonder how true his reaction to Diana's death was.  It's hard for me to believe that Charles shead a tear for Diana.  After their failed marriage and divorce, I'm sure there were and still are sour grapes between them.  If anything I would think that he would be glad to be rid of her once and for all, because his aunt, Princess Margaret, said it best when she said that Diana was more annoying dead than alive.Still, this is a fine movie that flows very easily and shows a good snapshot of a point in time.",4,Long live The Queen,1181001600,"06 5, 2007",2007,2608,"['shall', 'begin', 'review', 'saying', 'was', 'not', 'avid', 'fan', 'Princess', 'Diana', 'remember', 'very', 'well', 'when', 'was', 'child', 'hubbub', 'royal', 'wedding', 'had', 'always', 'been', 'one', 'most', 'prominent', 'celebrities', 'knew', 'one', 'point', 'time', 'someone', 'was', 'talking', 'Diana', 'said', 'point', 'was', 'just', 'celebrity', 'garbage', 'fluff', 'gave', 'big', 'Who', 'did', ""n't"", 'care', 'why', 'did', 'wake', 'up', 'mom', 'middle', 'night', 'faithful', 'day', '1997', 'when', 'was', 'killed', 'car', 'accident', 'Paris', 'watch', 'funeral', 'TV', 'few', 'days', 'later', 'did', 'not', 'watch', 'movie', 'based', 'celebrity', 'fascination', 'Diana', 'other', 'British', 'royal', 'family', 'see', 'true', 'flow', 'relationship', 'government', 'houses', 'Helen', 'Mirren', 'superior', 'job', 'portraying', 'Elizabeth', 'II', 'refined', 'stiff', 'upper', 'lipped', 'T.', 'same', 'time', 'just', 'weeks', 'before', 'Tony', 'Blair', 'had', 'been', 'elected', 'first', 'time', 'years', 'Labour', 'Party', 'had', 'been', 'appointed', 'Prime', 'Minister', 'was', 'also', 'very', 'exciting', 'time', 'England', 'was', 'sense', 'change', 'election', 'Just', 'Tony', 'Blair', 'was', 'getting', 'feet', 'wet', 'new', 'job', 'Diana', 'killed', 'car', 'accident', 'UK', 'let', 'alone', 'rest', 'world', 'was', 'thrown', 'chaos', 'looked', 'queen', 'make', 'statement', 'remained', 'silent.This', 'movie', 'showed', 'tensions', 'conflict', 'very', 'well', 'royals', 'public', 'Elizabeth', 'had', 'distain', 'Diana', 'be', 'sure', 'tabloid', 'fiasco', 'Charles', 'divorce', 'wanted', 'remain', 'silent', 'generation', 'royalty', 'duty', 'wanted', 'remain', 'silent', 'show', 'respects', 'public', 'wanted', 'hear', 'statement', 'different', 'world', 'now', 'having', 'new', 'enthusiastic', 'Prime', 'Minister', 'pressuring', 'adjust', 'love', 'scene', 'where', 'meet', 'first', 'time', 'said', 'Winston', 'Churchhill', 'sat', 'very', 'same', 'chair', 'had', 'say', 'something', 'only', 'critical', 'words', 'have', 'movie', 'are', 'portrail', 'Prince', 'Charles', 'wonder', 'how', 'true', 'reaction', 'Diana', 'death', 'was', 'hard', 'believe', 'Charles', 'shead', 'tear', 'Diana', 'failed', 'marriage', 'divorce', ""'m"", 'sure', 'were', 'still', 'are', 'sour', 'grapes', 'anything', 'would', 'think', 'would', 'be', 'glad', 'be', 'rid', 'once', 'aunt', 'Princess', 'Margaret', 'said', 'best', 'when', 'said', 'Diana', 'was', 'more', 'annoying', 'dead', 'alive.Still', 'fine', 'movie', 'very', 'easily', 'good', 'snapshot', 'point', 'time']",The Queen

Helen Mirren deserved her Oscar for her portrayal of Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth.This movie covers Tony Blair's landslide election in 1997 and his first meeting with the Queen.  Then we jump to August 30, 1997 when Princess Diana was killed in that infamous car wreck, the aftermath and how the Royal family, especially the Queen, was harshly criticized for not speaking out earlier and trying to comfort her people.She meant no harm, but truly believed she was doing the right thing by staying at Balmoral and tending to Diana's boys and their emotional needs.  She assumed the ""people"" would expect her to remain silent and out of sight.  She couldn't have been more wrong.  She truly had no idea the huge impact Diana's death had on her people or people around the world.  As Prince Charles says in the film, the Diana they knew and experienced had no connection whatsoever to the public Diana and how the public felt about her.  He knew better than anyone how the public felt about Diana, and he knew the awful consequences of ignoring or dismissing that adoration.As I remember reading in one account at the time that the British people were ""delirious"" with grief.  I, myself, felt deeply grieved and depressed for about two weeks after her death.  It hit me hard.  I had gotten up in the wee hours to watch Diana's wedding.  And I got up early to watch her funeral.Poor Tony Blair tried to tell the Queen what was going on and what she needed to do, and at first the Queen thought he was just wet behind the ears and clueless about ""her"" people.  Tony Blair comes to admire and respect the Queen, and even feel affection and sympathy for her.  Her father became King after his brother King Edward VIII abdicated the throne to marry an American divorcee, Wallis Simpson.  Elizabeth's father was never groomed for the throne as his brother had been, and many blamed the stress for his early death.  Upon her father's death, Elizabeth ascended to the throne as a young woman.  As the Queen's aide tells Mr. Blair, the Queen had not experienced something like this (the furor after Diana's death) since the abdication and she was in shock.Queen Elizabeth redeems herself in the end, and continues to hold the affection of the British people, as well as Americans and millions around the world.  I think this film shows us a stoic, self-contained woman, but a woman who truly wants to have the affection of her subjects and to serve them well.",5,Excellent,1181433600,"06 10, 2007",2007,2573,"['had', 'wanted', 'see', 'movie', 'long', 'time', 'finally', 'did', 'last', 'night', 'movie', 'held', 'interest', 'beginning', 'end', 'Helen', 'Mirren', 'deserved', 'Oscar', 'portrayal', 'Her', 'Majesty', 'Queen', 'Elizabeth.This', 'movie', 'Tony', 'Blair', 'landslide', 'election', '1997', 'first', 'meeting', 'Queen', 'Then', 'jump', 'August', '30', '1997', 'when', 'Princess', 'Diana', 'was', 'killed', 'infamous', 'car', 'wreck', 'aftermath', 'how', 'Royal', 'family', 'especially', 'Queen', 'was', 'harshly', 'criticized', 'not', 'speaking', 'out', 'earlier', 'trying', 'comfort', 'people.She', 'meant', 'harm', 'truly', 'believed', 'was', 'doing', 'right', 'thing', 'staying', 'Balmoral', 'tending', 'Diana', 'boys', 'emotional', 'needs', 'assumed', 'people', 'would', 'expect', 'remain', 'silent', 'sight', 'could', ""n't"", 'have', 'been', 'more', 'wrong', 'truly', 'had', 'idea', 'huge', 'impact', 'Diana', 'death', 'had', 'people', 'people', 'world', 'Prince', 'Charles', 'film', 'Diana', 'knew', 'experienced', 'had', 'connection', 'whatsoever', 'public', 'Diana', 'how', 'public', 'felt', 'knew', 'better', 'anyone', 'how', 'public', 'felt', 'Diana', 'knew', 'awful', 'consequences', 'ignoring', 'dismissing', 'adoration.As', 'remember', 'reading', 'one', 'account', 'time', 'British', 'people', 'were', 'delirious', 'grief', 'felt', 'deeply', 'grieved', 'depressed', 'about', 'two', 'weeks', 'death', 'hit', 'hard', 'had', 'gotten', 'up', 'wee', 'hours', 'watch', 'Diana', 'wedding', 'got', 'up', 'early', 'watch', 'funeral.Poor', 'Tony', 'Blair', 'tried', 'tell', 'Queen', 'was', 'going', 'what', 'needed', 'do', 'first', 'Queen', 'thought', 'was', 'just', 'wet', 'ears', 'clueless', 'people', 'Tony', 'Blair', 'admire', 'respect', 'Queen', 'even', 'feel', 'affection', 'sympathy', 'father', 'became', 'King', 'brother', 'King', 'Edward', 'VIII', 'abdicated', 'throne', 'marry', 'American', 'divorcee', 'Wallis', 'Simpson', 'Elizabeth', 'father', 'was', 'never', 'groomed', 'throne', 'brother', 'had', 'been', 'many', 'blamed', 'stress', 'early', 'death', 'father', 'death', 'Elizabeth', 'ascended', 'throne', 'young', 'woman', 'Queen', 'aide', 'Mr.', 'Blair', 'Queen', 'had', 'not', 'experienced', 'something', 'furor', 'Diana', 'death', 'abdication', 'was', 'shock.Queen', 'Elizabeth', 'end', 'hold', 'affection', 'British', 'people', 'as', 'well', 'Americans', 'millions', 'world', 'think', 'film', 'stoic', 'self-contained', 'woman', 'woman', 'who', 'have', 'affection', 'subjects', 'serve', 'well']",The Queen

The two of them give towering performances that will remain indelibly impressed on your mind after viewing the film. Mirren is all crisp elegance and Sheen is a charmer who knows how to use his powers of persuasion. Both of them are ideally cast in roles they seem to inhabit with consummate ease.The screenplay deals with the unpleasant private events unfolding at the palace while the public mourning was obviously so great that it had to be acknowledged. The Queen preferred keeping tight-lipped and dignified, obviously not a woman who was pleased with Diana's conduct. Nor was her husband Prince Philip (JAMES CROMWELL) or Prince Charles (ALEX JENNINGS) who at least reminded his mother that Diana loved her children dearly.Handsomely photographed with newsreel footage of the crowds that began swelling shortly after Diana's demise in that tragic accident, it's dialog is convincing throughout, concise and to the point without any frills whatsoever. The only weakness in the casting would seem to be SYLVIA SYMS as the Queen Mother who somehow doesn't look the role.The original background score by Alexandre Desplat is worthy of note, always appropriate and sometimes majestic. The scene with The Queen seeing the stag on the hillside while waiting for her car to be repaired is a standout, beautifully played.Summing up: A rare treat, and a slice of history well worth remembering with the shift from the old monarchy to the modernized ideas of a young Prime Minister emphasized in the script.",5,Splendid recreation of events surrounding Diana's death...,1185580800,"07 28, 2007",2007,1674,"['HELEN', 'MIRREN', 'course', 'focal', 'point', 'THE', 'QUEEN', 'MICHAEL', 'SHEEN', 'Tony', 'Blair', 'certainly', 'more', 'matches', 'role', 'Britain', 'youngest', 'prime', 'minister', 'two', 'give', 'towering', 'performances', 'will', 'remain', 'indelibly', 'impressed', 'mind', 'viewing', 'film', 'Mirren', 'crisp', 'elegance', 'Sheen', 'charmer', 'who', 'how', 'use', 'powers', 'persuasion', 'are', 'ideally', 'cast', 'roles', 'seem', 'inhabit', 'consummate', 'ease.The', 'screenplay', 'deals', 'unpleasant', 'private', 'events', 'unfolding', 'palace', 'public', 'mourning', 'was', 'obviously', 'so', 'great', 'had', 'be', 'acknowledged', 'Queen', 'preferred', 'keeping', 'tight-lipped', 'dignified', 'obviously', 'not', 'woman', 'who', 'was', 'pleased', 'Diana', 'conduct', 'was', 'husband', 'Prince', 'Philip', 'JAMES', 'CROMWELL', 'Prince', 'Charles', 'ALEX', 'JENNINGS', 'who', 'least', 'reminded', 'mother', 'Diana', 'loved', 'children', 'dearly.Handsomely', 'photographed', 'newsreel', 'footage', 'crowds', 'began', 'swelling', 'shortly', 'Diana', 'demise', 'tragic', 'accident', 'dialog', 'convincing', 'concise', 'point', 'frills', 'only', 'weakness', 'casting', 'would', 'seem', 'be', 'SYLVIA', 'SYMS', 'Queen', 'Mother', 'who', 'somehow', ""n't"", 'look', 'role.The', 'original', 'background', 'score', 'Alexandre', 'Desplat', 'worthy', 'note', 'always', 'appropriate', 'sometimes', 'majestic', 'scene', 'Queen', 'seeing', 'stag', 'hillside', 'waiting', 'car', 'be', 'repaired', 'standout', 'beautifully', 'played.Summing', 'up', 'rare', 'treat', 'slice', 'history', 'well', 'remembering', 'shift', 'old', 'monarchy', 'modernized', 'ideas', 'young', 'Prime', 'Minister', 'emphasized', 'script']",The Queen

The story is told from multiple points of view, with the Queen and Tony Blair being the two main protagonists.  He is in touch with the British people; she is not.  She is in touch with England's past, they are not.  She feels the best way to get past Diana's death is in private; the public want a public ceremony.  So opposites collide and as a sign of a modern country, the monarch gives way to the people's will.

The film stars Dame Helen Mirren in the role of her career, which earned her the Golden Globe and the Academy Award for Best Performance by an Actress in a Leading Role, for her flawless portrayal of Queen Elizabeth II. The film is set in 1997, covering the aftermath of the sudden death of Princess Diana. Diana's death occurred a few months after Prime Minister Tony Blair (Michael Sheen) settles into his new position as the head of government for the United Kingdom. During a time of national crisis, the British public was leaving acres of flowers in the gates of Buckingham Palace and grieving for the loss of their ""people's princess."" They were particularly enraged with the royal family for not showing any signs of remorse or sympathy toward the loss of their beloved Princess Diana. Initially, the queen forbids any members of the royal family to publicly speak about Diana's death and insists that Diana's funeral be treated as a private matter. Other members of the royal family handle Diana's death similarly; Prince Philip (James Cromwell) takes William and Harry, Diana's two sons, deer-hunting every day after their mother's death to pre-occupy their minds with something else. The Queen Mother (Sylvia Syms), agrees with Prince Philip and reminds the sovereign to stand up to her beliefs since she took an oath of performing ""duty first and self second."" The climax of the film takes place when Queen Elizabeth II drives to the forest in a jeep that breaks down while trying to pass through a river. Upon waiting for her mechanic to arrive, she comes across a deer which stares at her directly in the eye. This is the scene where director Stephen Frears humanizes the queen, and in a state of awe, the monarch shows off her inner emotions by shedding tears to acknowledge the animal's natural beauty. This deer is an analogy of the late Princess Diana, who had the same name as Diana, the Roman goddess of hunting, and like a deer she was continually being hunted by the paparazzi. The deer encounter has a profound effect on the monarch's future decision-making: She finally gives in to Prime Minister Blair's pressures to make Princess Diana's funeral available to the general public, she asks for the lowering of the flag on top of Buckingham Palace, and lastly, she is persuaded to fly to London to attend Diana's funeral, along with the other members of the royal family. This DVD is recommended for anybody who is interested in seeing the best screen performance by a female actor of 2006 in a role where Mirren showcases her exquisite acting range by playing a powerful, complex and private monarch, in a film that was well-loved by the public and garnered rave reviews by the toughest critics.",5,The Queen: Helen Mirren's most compelling screen performance!,1178409600,"05 6, 2007",2007,2858,"['Queen', 'critically', 'acclaimed', 'film', 'British', 'director', 'Stephen', 'Frears', 'screenwriter', 'Peter', 'Morgan', 'came', 'out', 'DVD', 'April', '24', '2007', 'film', 'stars', 'Dame', 'Helen', 'Mirren', 'role', 'career', 'earned', 'Golden', 'Globe', 'Academy', 'Award', 'Best', 'Performance', 'Actress', 'Leading', 'Role', 'flawless', 'portrayal', 'Queen', 'Elizabeth', 'II', 'film', 'set', '1997', 'covering', 'aftermath', 'sudden', 'death', 'Princess', 'Diana', 'Diana', 'death', 'occurred', 'few', 'months', 'Prime', 'Minister', 'Tony', 'Blair', 'Michael', 'Sheen', 'new', 'position', 'head', 'government', 'United', 'Kingdom', 'time', 'national', 'crisis', 'British', 'public', 'was', 'leaving', 'acres', 'flowers', 'gates', 'Buckingham', 'Palace', 'grieving', 'loss', 'people', 'princess', 'were', 'particularly', 'enraged', 'royal', 'family', 'not', 'showing', 'signs', 'remorse', 'sympathy', 'loss', 'beloved', 'Princess', 'Diana', 'Initially', 'queen', 'forbids', 'members', 'royal', 'family', 'publicly', 'speak', 'Diana', 'death', 'Diana', 'funeral', 'be', 'treated', 'private', 'matter', 'Other', 'members', 'royal', 'family', 'handle', 'Diana', 'death', 'similarly', 'Prince', 'Philip', 'James', 'Cromwell', 'William', 'Harry', 'Diana', 'two', 'sons', 'deer-hunting', 'day', 'mother', 'death', 'pre-occupy', 'minds', 'something', 'else', 'Queen', 'Mother', 'Sylvia', 'Syms', 'Prince', 'Philip', 'sovereign', 'stand', 'up', 'beliefs', 'took', 'oath', 'performing', 'duty', 'first', 'self', 'second', 'climax', 'film', 'place', 'when', 'Queen', 'Elizabeth', 'II', 'forest', 'jeep', 'down', 'trying', 'pass', 'river', 'waiting', 'mechanic', 'arrive', 'deer', 'directly', 'eye', 'scene', 'where', 'director', 'Stephen', 'Frears', 'queen', 'state', 'awe', 'monarch', 'inner', 'emotions', 'shedding', 'tears', 'acknowledge', 'animal', 'natural', 'beauty', 'deer', 'analogy', 'late', 'Princess', 'Diana', 'who', 'had', 'same', 'name', 'Diana', 'Roman', 'goddess', 'hunting', 'deer', 'was', 'continually', 'being', 'hunted', 'paparazzi', 'deer', 'encounter', 'profound', 'effect', 'monarch', 'future', 'decision-making', 'finally', 'Prime', 'Minister', 'Blair', 'pressures', 'make', 'Princess', 'Diana', 'funeral', 'available', 'general', 'public', 'lowering', 'flag', 'top', 'Buckingham', 'Palace', 'lastly', 'persuaded', 'fly', 'London', 'attend', 'Diana', 'funeral', 'other', 'members', 'royal', 'family', 'DVD', 'recommended', 'anybody', 'who', 'interested', 'seeing', 'best', 'screen', 'performance', 'female', 'actor', '2006', 'role', 'where', 'Mirren', 'exquisite', 'acting', 'range', 'playing', 'powerful', 'complex', 'private', 'monarch', 'film', 'was', 'well-loved', 'public', 'garnered', 'rave', 'reviews', 'toughest', 'critics']",The Queen

I remember those days wellDon't we all? I'll never forget that morning on August 31st 1997. I'd been at a house party with some friends and after a totally fun night of dancing to anything from Notorious B.I.G.'s ""Hypnotize"" to Whitney Houston's ""I'm Every Woman"", we all staggered out into the dawn light to hear people chatting nervously, almost fearfully, about something. Princess Diana has been seriously hurt in an accident in Paris, someone eventually said out loud in shocked disbelief. Stunned, we all got into the car and immediately turned on the radio to hear that it was true. By the time I finally made it home and turned on the TV, her death had already been confirmed.So, a documentary then?Well, not quite, though this fantastic movie is almost documentary-like, with its well placed news clips, presented and voiced by broadcasters we all know and respect here in the UK. In actuality, it is part recent history and part clever speculation. Its main focus seems to be the gross miscalculation made by the royal family immediately following the tragedy. They seemed very remote, very aloof and while we see actual footage of world leaders like Presidents Clinton and Mandela were making public statements of grief and shock in this movie, Queen Elizabeth II and her family remain resolutely silent.As you mentioned earlier, it wasn't a good time for the monarchy.No, it definitely wasn't. The monarchy's popularity in Britain plummeted to its lowest levels in centuries in the autumn of 1997, while conversely, Tony Blair, the freshly minted prime minister came out of it all smelling of roses. By 2002 though, when the Queen celebrated her Golden Jubilee, it seems her subjects had forgiven her. Maybe we saw the big picture and were not going to allow one mistake, no matter how big, to obliterate 50 years of outstanding and selfless service. Or maybe, in this tabloid media driven age of fickle celebrity, we've just developed much shorter memories. Whatever.So who's in it then?Ah, yes, of course. Well, Helen Mirren gives the performance of a lifetime as The Queen and after years of admiring her work, I'm so happy to see her finally get her due: Golden Globe, Bafta and Oscar. She graciously said it was The Queen that people were honouring but we all know it was her performance as The Queen and her incredible talent in general. Martin Sheen carries off the role of Tony Blair pretty amazingly as well, even though the resemblance is fleeting at best. James Cromwell - remember him from ""Six Feet Under""? - does a remarkable impression of Prince Philip and don't forget to check out Helen McCrory as Cherie Blair. She doesn't seem to be a huge fan of the Royal family, does she? (Of course, as I mentioned earlier, most of this movie is pure speculation).But we were all there at the time. It was almost ten years ago. What's the huge attraction now?I think that is what makes this movie so fascinating. For me anyway. It's about a time in recent history that I lived through and still remember quite clearly. I didn't go as far as some did, with all their weeping, wailing and shaking outside Kensington Palace but I was very sad about Diana's death.But most crucial of all, I think, this movie is sympathetic towards the Queen and shows us a (possible) side to her that we never get to see. Helen Mirren plays her with great warmth and depth and we see, probably for the first time, just why she may have reacted in the way that she did back then. The entire movie suggests a side to the story that we weren't privy to and probably never will be and I think that's why the movie went down a storm here in the UK. It also reminds us how we all lost the plot for a minute back there in September of 1997. That's the fun part - being able to see something and shout: Oh, I remember that! What were we thinking? The good old days.As for why Americans have taken to it, I can only speculate. Royalty has always been something of a fascination for our cousins and remember that this tale of The Queen is circled by or entangled with somewhat, the story of Diana, a woman who still enthrals on both sides of the Atlantic even now, 10 years after her untimely death. I saw a 2-hour special about Princess Diana's life on the Biography channel recently. Even though I was relatively familiar with the story, I was still gripped from beginning to end.

Crabtree ""The Old Grottomaster""","[2, 4]","I want to say up front that Helen Mirren's performance as Queen Elizabeth II in this film is first-class, just superb. In fact, this is the most redeeming facet of the movie.The story is this: Here, we have an intimate glimpse of Queen Elizabeth II (as well as her husband, the Queen Mother, and Prince Charles) during the window of time just before and during the week or so period of time after Princess Diana was killed in a car crash in Paris. The focal point of the movie is the hostile reaction of the British people toward the Queen's cold attitude in regard to Diana's death.I need to say up front that I'm a fan neither of The Royals nor of the late Princess -- but I AM interested in hearing all about their endless peccadilloes. In fact, this actuality was one of my disappointments because I thought that this film was about the Queen's entire reign, and it's not. Still, I can't rightfully criticise what the film is NOT about... I just wish that the title had been more explicit.In any case, right away the Queen and the Windsor-Mountbatten family are portrayed as pretty heartless and rotten, at least by American standards. Following the death of Diana, Prince Charles is also served up to us as a spineless flip-flopper and a witless wimp... okay so far.At that point, newly-elected Prime Minister Tony Blair begins advising and urging the Queen to relent on her silence and isolation and share in the grief of the British people over Diane's death, a pill that the old sourpuss finds almost impossible to swallow. Still okay so far.Then, at a turning point in the movie, the producers elect to REDEEM the Queen, just because she came out and sniffed the flowers under extreme political pressure and duress. There was not the first bit of actual remorse in that woman's heart (neither in the film nor in reality!) So, WHY did the film-makers decide to attempt to make her look like a normal human being? I surely have not figured it out!So, in summary, I found this movie to be manipulative, although I must assert that this device was completely lost on me. I hold the Queen in no higher esteem now (post-film) than I did when she was acting like a witch the day after Diana died, (or even before that.)As far as the cinematography and the continuity of the film, it was superb. The Producers also shrewdly used some actual footage of Diana and others which was sprinkled throughout the movie. There's a lot of nice scenery in this flick and some really terrific acting.

647735,A39AN1E0VZGPB9,B00005JPAM,Polkadotty,"[1, 1]","My daughter and I watched this together and were impressed at the sensitive, polite performances depicting some high profile, very-much-alive characters. Not an easy task by any means.  Helen Mirren deserves her Oscar for her Elizabeth, a self-sufficient stiff-upper-lip but terribly out of touch monarch.  Her relationship to the Queen Mother is touching and tender and how she and Prince Philip maintain their marriage, one obviously built upon respect for the other, refreshingly candid.  Prince Charles appeared truly blindsided and deeply wounded over Diana's death and his only concern seemed to be for his children, and how Diana appeared to them in the end.  The tabloids and TV were forbidden to the children and wisely so; they'd lost their mother not a celebrity after all.  The movie well explains why the monarchy kept a low profile.  It had very much to do with family loyalty and the feelings of Diana's boys, whom Prince Philip adores and did his best to divert wholesomely through outdoor activities during that extremely difficult period. (The parallel between the hunt for the stag on the royal property and how Elizabeth felt hunted by the press struck me greatly.) Tony Blair's character depicted a conflicted man torn between plans for ""modernisation"" and the long-standing dignity of an increasingly antiquated monarchy.  In his off hours he's a loving family man who admires his intelligent wife, at work he treats his staff as equals intellectually and socially, and has the best interests of his nation, including the monarchy, at heart.  The footage of Diana and the public mourning brought great immediacy to the story.

Between the kerchiefs and the corgis, the sensible clothes and the semi-detached smile, Britain's Queen Elizabeth II has never been mistaken for the most dramatic monarch in the world, never given much of a hint that there might be a Major Motion Picture in her life. But this immovable object has met the unstoppable force that is actress Helen Mirren, one of the great masters of modern screen acting. In a commanding performance that is as compelling as it is unexpected, she has turned ""The Queen"" into something you never imagined it could be: a crackling dramatic story that's intelligent, thoughtful and moving.""Kenneth TuranHelen Mirren is extraordinary. Not only does she have the ability to take on the appearance of Elizabeth II, The Queen, she is able to reveal in small bits and pieces the humanity of Elizabeth II. Helen Mirren has said that in portraying a living person she imagines that person as a masterpiece painting. She is then able to take the brush and paint as she sees fit.The underlying story is the week the 'People's Princess', Diana dies. Tony Blair, as played by Michael Sheen, has been elected the new Prime Minister. Sheen's performance is sensational. He msut tell The Queen that she is mishandeling the death of Diana. At their first meeting the Queen has reminded Mr Blair, he is her tenth Prime Minister, and he needs to live up to the likes of Winston Churchill. And, this becomes Prime Minister Tony  Blair's fulfilling moment. Diana and The Queen had always been at odds. The Queen wore her emotions tightly locked up  and Diana wore her emotions on her sleeve.  Prince Phillip, as played by James Cromwell is aloof and distant and has no regard for the ex-Princess at all. The ploy to stay in Scotland at Balmoral Castle, for the children's sake does not work. The  public is clamoring for some statement from the Queen.  The Queen asks advice of the Queen mother played by Sylvia Syms, but she, too,has a stiff upper lip. Prince Charles, Alex Jennings, a more modern man, asks Tony Blair to speak to the Queen to provide a statement that is befittng the Princess.  A statement is prepared, but we can see the Queen has some misgivings. The public responds to the Queen's words.""Helen Mirren's allure lies not in finding what's regal in every woman she plays, but in finding what's womanly in every royal."" Entertainment WeeklyI loved almost everyone in this movie. Prince Phillip not as much.  It was riveting at times and so revealing of the Monarchy that does not, can not, reveal its private nature. The movie is funny and touching in ways you can't predict. Stephen Frears as director, has completed a beautifully moving film, rich in detail. He uses real footage of the funeral and of Diana. We are finally allowed to see the real dignity in the Queen. The current state of the world is referenced when the Queen reminds Tony Blair that the 'people can turn',""one day, quite suddenly, the same thing will happen to you.""  I will never look at the real Queen Elizabeth II the same way again after seeing Helen Mirren's portrayal. This may be the greatest gift Elizabeth II could have received.Highly Recommended. prisrob 5-3-07Elizabeth IDVDHigh FidelityDVD",5,"""Uneasy The Head That Wears The Crown"" Henry IV, part 2",1178064000,"05 2, 2007",2007,3224,"['Go', 'ahead', 'admit', 'kerchiefs', 'corgis', 'sensible', 'clothes', 'semi-detached', 'smile', 'Britain', 'Queen', 'Elizabeth', 'II', 'never', 'been', 'mistaken', 'most', 'dramatic', 'monarch', 'world', 'never', 'given', 'much', 'hint', 'might', 'be', 'Major', 'Motion', 'Picture', 'life', 'immovable', 'object', 'met', 'unstoppable', 'force', 'actress', 'Helen', 'Mirren', 'one', 'great', 'masters', 'modern', 'screen', 'acting', 'commanding', 'performance', 'as', 'compelling', 'unexpected', 'turned', 'Queen', 'something', 'never', 'imagined', 'could', 'be', 'crackling', 'dramatic', 'story', 'intelligent', 'thoughtful', 'moving', 'Kenneth', 'TuranHelen', 'Mirren', 'extraordinary', 'Not', 'only', 'have', 'ability', 'take', 'appearance', 'Elizabeth', 'II', 'Queen', 'able', 'reveal', 'small', 'bits', 'humanity', 'Elizabeth', 'II', 'Helen', 'Mirren', 'said', 'portraying', 'living', 'person', 'person', 'masterpiece', 'painting', 'then', 'able', 'take', 'brush', 'paint', 'fit.The', 'underlying', 'story', 'week', ""'People"", 'Princess', 'Diana', 'Tony', 'Blair', 'played', 'Michael', 'Sheen', 'been', 'elected', 'new', 'Prime', 'Minister', 'Sheen', 'performance', 'sensational', 'tell', 'Queen', 'mishandeling', 'death', 'Diana', 'first', 'meeting', 'Queen', 'reminded', 'Mr', 'Blair', 'tenth', 'Prime', 'Minister', 'live', 'up', 'likes', 'Winston', 'Churchill', 'Prime', 'Minister', 'Tony', 'Blair', 'fulfilling', 'moment', 'Diana', 'Queen', 'had', 'always', 'been', 'odds', 'Queen', 'wore', 'emotions', 'tightly', 'locked', 'up', 'Diana', 'wore', 'emotions', 'sleeve', 'Prince', 'Phillip', 'played', 'James', 'Cromwell', 'aloof', 'distant', 'regard', 'ex-Princess', 'ploy', 'stay', 'Scotland', 'Balmoral', 'Castle', 'children', 'sake', 'not', 'work', 'public', 'clamoring', 'statement', 'Queen', 'Queen', 'advice', 'Queen', 'mother', 'played', 'Sylvia', 'Syms', 'too', 'stiff', 'upper', 'lip', 'Prince', 'Charles', 'Alex', 'Jennings', 'more', 'modern', 'man', 'Tony', 'Blair', 'speak', 'Queen', 'provide', 'statement', 'Princess', 'statement', 'prepared', 'can', 'see', 'Queen', 'misgivings', 'public', 'Queen', 'words', 'Helen', 'Mirren', 'allure', 'not', 'finding', 'what', 'regal', 'woman', 'finding', 'what', 'womanly', 'royal', 'Entertainment', 'WeeklyI', 'loved', 'almost', 'everyone', 'movie', 'Prince', 'Phillip', 'not', 'as', 'much', 'was', 'riveting', 'times', 'so', 'revealing', 'Monarchy', 'not', 'can', 'not', 'reveal', 'private', 'nature', 'movie', 'funny', 'touching', 'ways', 'ca', ""n't"", 'predict', 'Stephen', 'Frears', 'director', 'completed', 'beautifully', 'moving', 'film', 'rich', 'detail', 'real', 'footage', 'funeral', 'Diana', 'are', 'finally', 'allowed', 'see', 'real', 'dignity', 'Queen', 'current', 'state', 'world', 'referenced', 'when', 'Queen', 'Tony', 'Blair', ""'people"", 'can', 'turn', 'one', 'day', 'quite', 'suddenly', 'same', 'thing', 'will', 'happen', 'will', 'never', 'look', 'real', 'Queen', 'Elizabeth', 'II', 'same', 'way', 'again', 'seeing', 'Helen', 'Mirren', 'portrayal', 'may', 'be', 'greatest', 'gift', 'Elizabeth', 'II', 'could', 'have', 'received.Highly', 'Recommended', 'prisrob', '5-3-07Elizabeth', 'IDVDHigh', 'FidelityDVD']",The Queen

Sort of like water to a goldfish, she's always been ""there"" but I never thought much about her.  Until Diana's death and then my focus was on Diana.  Now this film has switched my focus to the Queen.  Hmmm.There's no doubt that Mirren's performance was superb and certainly Oscar worthy.  She's a classy lady and the class shows up here.  The one thing that worries me, though, is that she may have infused the character of Elizabeth with some of her own generous humanity, thus making her more friendly than she really is. I found myself much more sympathetic to her at the end of the film than I was in the beginning.  Even the doltish Prince Phillip seemed sort of harmlessly quaint and even humorous. Were these people really that nice?  Who knows?I have found this to be a problem in many films---I loved John Lone as the Last Emperor of China but was the real emperor really that sweet?  Doubt it. Also, Sir Thomas More....After watching Paul Scofield in A Man for All Seasons, anyone would immediately vote for More's sainthood.  Yet, we read that the real Thomas had a dark side that the film doesn't show.Like Marlon Brando's performance of the Godfather did a lot to glamorize  guys who probably were really an ugly bunch of thugs.So....I think it's important to see these ""historical"" movies, enjoy them, but keep an open mind about the veracity of the characterizations.

The range of this actress is quite simply incredible.  She can do no wrong and here she is simply superb.As ""The Queen"" Helen indeed fleshes out a royal most of the world knows very little about and therefore has made all sorts of unfounded assumptions about as well.  This also takes place during a very taxing time in anyone's life, much less a family so public as this.  Hellen manages to make Queen Elizabeth quite human, trying in the midst of the turmoil surrounding the death of Princess Diana to deal with the situation as best as she knows how.  She reacts like a woman who has pledged her life to her country first, then as a mother, and then as a grandmother.  Her impatience with Princess Diana recounts any mother-in-law's impatience with her ex-daughter-in-law; the added variable of this being the royal family of England makes it all the more complicated.  Before seeing this, I, like I imagine a lot of us, also thought the Queen was entirely too disconnected.  But things are not always as they seem.  Of course some of the Queen's actions are questionable and maybe some of her behavior may not be excused, but at least this presentation endeavors to at least submit motives behind those actions.The film moves quickly, is actually quite witty, the writing is top-notch with Helen's performance, of course, being the driving force.  A most poignant scene is her reaction to seeing the elk?, deer"", (whatever) in the woods before it is eventually hunted down for sport.  It is a classic example of stopping to smell the roses in the midst of a most intense human drama.To say I highly recommend is a masterpiece of understatment.

That isn't always a guarantee of a good film but ""The Queen"" is a reminder that often it IS.  I really didn't know what to expect but I was drawn in quickly.  Whomever decided to make a movie about the warm, loving side of QEII gets my vote for the Oscar for Best Original Idea.  This movie actually works very well and I found myself cheering for the old gal.  The rather recent history was also a big plus as I suspect most of us find ourselves being drawn back into the shocking event of Princess Di's untimely death.  I'm sure that there were plenty of people like myself who never really followed the Princess yet were drawn into the communal sadness that followed her fatal accident.  I recall the British uproar over the lack of any emotional expression from Queen Elizabeth II and, admittedly, her inaction seemed pretty cold at the time.  I actually feel better now about her and a lot of other things.  I was engrossed in the portrayal of the official yet caring relationship that the new PM Tony Blair was developing with her majesty.  I'm sure much of this is creative but the frequent use of newsreel accounts seems to draw us into a sense of complete reality.

But I bet for the Brits, with a story as recent as this one, there are as many interpretations of this film as there are English citizens.Regardless it's not just Mirren and Sheen who shine here.  James Cromwell (the farmer from Babe) plays a spot-on Prince Philip, the Queen's traditionalist husband.  Alex Jennings delivers a convincingly vulnerable Prince Charles, whose pesky ex-wife has suddenly captured his nation's vigilant sympathy.  And Helen McCrory offers a fascinating Cherie Blair, the prime minister's anti-monarchist wife who suspects her husband's sympathy toward the Queen stems from a son's respect for his stoic mother.All in all THE QUEEN is a great flick that could entertain everyone, regardless of their interest in England's dysfunctional royal family.-- Regina McMenamin",5,God Save the Queen -- From Herself,1168300800,"01 9, 2007",2007,1594,"['Highly', 'recommended', 'anyone', 'who', 'good', 'story', 'THE', 'QUEEN', 'first', 'week', 'Diana', 'Spencer', 'death', 'perspective', 'Queen', 'Elizabeth', 'Tony', 'Blair', 'expertly', 'portrayed', 'Best', 'Actress', 'shoo-in', 'Helen', 'Mirren', 'Michael', 'Sheen.A', 'well-organized', 'collage', 'news', 'footage', 'dramatic', 'reenactments', 'great', 'movie', 'royal', 'family', 'steadfast', 'refusal', 'address', 'British', 'public', 'former', 'princess', 'fatal', 'car', 'crash', 'prime', 'minister', 'incessant', 'pleas', 'Queen', 'make', 'televised', 'statement.Though', 'suspect', 'Brits', 'will', 'see', 'differently', 'perspective', 'QUEEN', 'study', 'head-in-the-sand', 'loyalty', 'tradition', 'what', 'when', 'unpredictable', 'unprecedented', 'happens', 'inflexible', 'robotic', 'royals', 'bet', 'Brits', 'story', 'as', 'recent', 'one', 'are', 'many', 'interpretations', 'film', 'are', 'English', 'citizens.Regardless', 'not', 'just', 'Mirren', 'Sheen', 'who', 'shine', 'here', 'James', 'Cromwell', 'farmer', 'Babe', 'spot-on', 'Prince', 'Philip', 'Queen', 'traditionalist', 'husband', 'Alex', 'Jennings', 'convincingly', 'vulnerable', 'Prince', 'Charles', 'pesky', 'ex-wife', 'suddenly', 'captured', 'nation', 'vigilant', 'sympathy', 'Helen', 'McCrory', 'fascinating', 'Cherie', 'Blair', 'prime', 'minister', 'anti-monarchist', 'wife', 'who', 'husband', 'sympathy', 'Queen', 'son', 'respect', 'stoic', 'mother.All', 'QUEEN', 'great', 'flick', 'could', 'entertain', 'everyone', 'regardless', 'interest', 'England', 'dysfunctional', 'royal', 'family.', 'Regina', 'McMenamin']",The Queen

Of course, no one rally knows what goes on behind closed doors at the Royal Palace, so the ingenuity of director Stephen Frears and writer Peter Morgan were put to task and have created a witty and fascinating scenario. Then I listened to the DVD commentary track and realized that there were dozens of in-jokes, many of which were ultimately cut.  There's a moment when Tony Blair (brilliantly played by Michael Sheen) points out that the queen was literally forced into her position, giving up any sense of a normal life. When the Queen sees the beautiful stag, wandering freely, always in danger, I almost thought that she wished she could trade places. Later, she was more concerned about the ultimate fate of the stag that she altered her plans. I liked Helen McCrory as Mrs. Blair, the voice of public opinion regarding the Royal Family, especially at the beginning. Prince Phillip was presented (by James Cromwell) as somewhat of a buffoon, and I enjoyed Sylvia Syms as the Queen Mother.Alex Jennings was very good as Prince Charles, hoping that Tony Blair would ""modernize"" things in England so he could relax a bit. Everything's been said before by previous reviewers, but these were my impressions.

The good news is that Helen Mirren is not to blame for any of the movie's shortcomings.  The bad news is that she is not enough to make the movie good.This is a movie that is reliant on the performances of the actors, and while Mirren is doing the best she can, she just isn't directed well enough for the viewer to feel any involvement or sympathy from the viewer.  What she does for the majority of the movie is sit or walk around with a stone look on her face, void of any emotion.  Even in one scene where she is out in the country on her own, you don't know she is sad until you see a tear on her face, which doesn't even look real.  I watched the movie the entire time feeling like this really should have been a movie about Princess Diana, since she is the royal most Americans ever really cared about.I will say that the movie starts to get better during the last 20 minutes of the movie.  Here, I will give Mirren props, since she really does make us care about the queen and what she is going through (these scenes are probably what guaranteed her Oscar win).  Unfortunately, 20 minutes does not a good movie make.In short, I was disappointed with The Queen.  Maybe if it wasn't a movie about Diana pretending to be about Queen Elizabeth II, I would have more kudos to give to it.  But as is, I just did not see the hype.

647755,A4FX5YCJA630V,B00005JPAM,"R. M. Fisher ""Ravenya""","[0, 0]","Just as every American knows where they were on 9/11, every Brit knows what they were doing when the news came in that Princess Diana had been killed in a car accident in Paris. Heck, I was a thirteen year old New Zealander and I still remember running home from my grandmother's house (having seen the news report on television) to tell my parents what had occurred. It was a shocking, confusing, upsetting time, and for anyone who remembers the media circus in the wake of the princess's death, ""The Queen"" provides a fascinating look at what might have been going on among those who were affected by it most.In 1997 the British public elected in a new Prime Minister by a landslide majority; he was Tony Blair - young, popular, and with republican sympathies. In many ways he was the polar opposite of Queen Elizabeth II in nearly every respect, and their initial relationship (at least as it's depicted here) was rather cool. Yet not long after Blair officially accepts the position, a much greater news story sweeps the country: Princess Diana has been killed in a car accident. Yet her death is just the background for the central dynamic of the film: the tentative alliance that forms between Blair and the Queen, and the questions that arise surrounding the nature of grief, and how it should be displayed.As the public begin to grieve their loss, they grow increasingly frustrated by the silence emitting from the royal family. Though the Queen insists that she must attend to her grandchildren and maintain dignity by not indulging the media, the public clamors for a more shared display of regret. They want flags flying at half-mast without understanding the protocol behind it. They want televised eulogies from every minister, celebrity and royal family member in existence. They demand that the Queen ""lead the people in grief"", whatever that means. They gather en-masse at the gates of Buckingham Palace to light candles and lay flowers for a woman they'd never even met.The Queen is baffled by it all, stating: ""we do things quietly in this country, and with dignity,"" but in doing so, seriously misreads the mood of her people. Blair on the other hand, steps up to the plate, coins the term ""the people's princess"" in his eulogy and increases his own popularity. Witnessing the growing antipathy toward the Queen, he tries to advise her to address her people, only to be met with stubbornness and pride. Something has to give, and Blair knows that the longer it takes for the Queen to make a public statement, the more it will seem as though she's simply bowing to public pressure.At the time it all happened, I really had no idea of the furor surrounding the actions (or inactions) of the royal family until much later after the event. Only by watching this film did I really begin to grasp the circumstances of that time. One suspects that most of the frenzy was whipped up by the media who needed a scapegoat for - if not Diana's death - than at least the aftermath, but the royals' inability to judge the needs/wants of the people was a serious oversight on their behalf. The film shows remarkable restraint in providing an impartial look at the events of those sad weeks, presenting the backstage events as they (may have) occurred, and thus allowing the audience to reach their own conclusions as to what should have happened regarding the public and the palace.The film concentrates mainly on the relationship between Tony Blair and Queen Elizabeth, specifically Blair's changing attitude toward the Queen; initially finding all the pomp and circumstance rather silly, getting immensely frustrated with the lack of cooperation from the palace, and finally delivering a final impassioned speech in the Queen's defense that is the closest the film gets to taking a side in the whole affair. (And as the Queen astutely points out afterwards, the reason Blair is so sympathetic to her plight is that he knows all too well that the public could turn on him just as easily - as indeed they did ten years later in the wake of the war on Iraq).Helen Mirren won the Oscar that year for her portrayal of Queen Elizabeth, and it's not difficult to see why. Capturing the mannerisms and speech patterns of the Queen without making it look as though she's trying too hard, Mirren presents a woman who is both strong and fragile, determined yet easily-led, wise in certain circumstances but foolish in others, witty and yet detached - in other words, a fully formed woman struggling with a PR challenge that she can't fully understand. There's a lovely moment in which the Queen is by herself out in the countryside (her car just having broken down) and she's facing away from the camera, allowing herself to cry over the ordeal for the first time. We're not sure why - is it for Diana? For the way she's been treated by the public? But whatever the reason, she eventually composes herself, and her face resettles into its dour ""game face"". Right in front of your eyes she goes from a woman to a Queen.Michael Sheen (who has played Tony Blair twice before inThe DealandThe Special Relationship) is clearly quite at home playing this particular character, and James Cromwell provides quite a scathing rendition of the boorish, thick-headed Prince Philip, whose main contribution to events is to give his wife consistently bad advice. Alex Jennings is a nervy but surprisingly sympathetic Prince Charles and Sylvia Syms gets some of the best lines as the Queen Mother (""nobody tells me anything,"" she snipes at one point). Wisely, Princes William and Harry are out-of-focus for the entirety of the film, appearing only from behind or from a distance. It's a respectful portrayal of the two individuals who were undoubtedly hurt the most by this entire ordeal, and director Steven Frears is mindful of their privacy.Speaking of whom, the real fascination with this film is how director Steven Frears and writer Peter Morgan manage to make it so darn interesting. Considering all it really involves is various people watching news reports, discussing things in conference rooms, attending press conferences and uncertainly moving from one place to the next, it's quite remarkable that the whole thing remains so rivetingly fast-paced (ironically, their shared DVD commentary is deathly boring). Replicating speeches that were said and outfits that were worn, as well as using stock footage and newsreels that aired at the time, all provide a sense of authenticity and immediacy. Little bits of trivia are peppered throughout (the Queen cannot vote; she was a mechanic in wartime) and though some segments can feel a bit heavy-handed (the symbolism surrounding that stag!) it remains a film that's fundamentally about topics not many people can resist: the lives that go on behind closed doors, the one-sided relationship that exist between leaders and followers, the frenzy of gossip and the media, the manipulative tactics of public relations, and of course - those royals.As a companion piece, try following this up with the identically named docu-dramaThe Queen, which explores more of the challenges that Queen Elizabeth has faced during her reign.",5,"""Will Someone Please Save These People From Themselves?""",1344038400,"08 4, 2012",2012,7159,"['Just', 'as',

This film went far towards explaining this, as the British establishment reeled after the death of Princess Diana. Tony Blair had just taken up his duties as Prime Minister when this tragedy struck. The nexus of this film is the struggle between Blair and the Queen concerning how the Monarchy should react to Diana's death. The British public demanded that the House of Windsor address the issue publicly, while the Queen implacably sought to keep out of the public eye during this turmoil. The Queen, at least according to this film, initially treated Blair with contempt, but eventually is forced to see that Blair correctly understood what the public demanded of the Monarchy. One interesting line in the film is where the Queen reflects that ""when a Queen loses touch with her subjects, maybe it is time for her to step aside in favor of a new generation..."" Now there is food for thought...This film depicts the Queen as a dignified lady, steeped in tradition, who is nevertheless hopelessly out of touch with public opinion and suffering from not a little over-arrogance. Tony Blair forces her to see that the Monarchy, in the end, must serve the people and meet their expectations. In one scene she sits in depression, staring at a newspaper headline ""Queen Bends the Knee to Blair."" Yes, that about summed it up.Helen Mirren absolutely nails the role of the Queen in this film, and Michael Sheen does very well as Tony Blair. All of the supporting actors do well.

647761,A19ZXK9HHVRV1X,B00005JPAM,Roland E. Zwick,"[0, 0]","****1/2""The Queen"" provides us with a fascinating glimpse into the heart of a royal - or, in the case of Queen Elizabeth II, quite possibly the void where that heart ought to be.The movie takes place in the weeks following the death of the beloved Princess Diana on August 30, 1997 (Diana had just recently gotten divorced from Prince Charles, so technically, she was no longer a part of the royal family). It was during this period of intense national mourning that the Queen demonstrated that she had a tin ear when it came to gauging the mood and feelings of her subjects. For many days, as the grieving multitudes gathered outside the gates of Buckingham Palace, weeping uncontrollably and laying down a veritable sea of flowers in the Princess' memory, the Royals remained holed up on a country estate, voluntary captives to ""protocol,"" making not so much as a single public statement acknowledging Diana's death or providing any words of solace to a hurting nation.The coldness of the reaction prompted many in England to seriously consider abolishing the monarchy altogether, once and for all consigning it to the ash heap of history as a quaint relic of a bygone era, an anachronistic institution that had long since outlived its usefulness. Yet, the film is much more sympathetic in its treatment of the monarch than that barebones synopsis would suggest, for more than anything else, it sees the queen less as a heartless monster than as an old-fashioned woman ill-equipped to deal with a modern world where baring one's soul in public has become the unquestioned norm and even a dignified solemn funeral is turned into a celebrity-laden, made-for-TV spectacle. She seems genuinely baffled and stunned by the unprecedented outpouring of grief over Diana's death, partly because of the queen's own animosity towards the woman whom she felt demeaned the court by many of her actions, and partly because the queen herself hails from a time when one did one's grieving in private, and when the sole role of a leader in a time of national crisis was to project an image of ""stiff-upper-lipped"" stoicism and strength for her people.It would have been easy for writer Peter Morgan and director Stephen Frears to have concentrated exclusively on the queen's aloofness and coldness, to have turned her into a caricature of the snooty, self-absorbed, ""let them eat cake"" aristocrat. Instead, the filmmakers insist on seeing her as a fully rounded human being, strong willed and unemotional, yet capable of being wounded by the disapproval of her subjects and of extending a hand of compassion to others in her own uniquely subtle way.Small wonder that Helen Mirren has been showered with every conceivable acting honor for her incomparable portrayal of this complex woman. Mirren has been handed the challenge of illuminating a character who is, by her very nature, unimpassioned and undemonstrative. As such, the actress has had to rely almost exclusively on the subtlest of expressions and gestures to convey the brittleness, stoicism and genuine royal dignity of a woman who literally grew up in the role of one of the world's longest-serving monarchs (she notes early on in the film that the first person to serve as her Prime Minister was a certain someone named Winston Churchill). Yet, Mirren's ability to also show us the queen's compassionate and vulnerable side is what brings the character to life and engages our interest.Mirren is matched by the brilliant Michael Sheen, whose performance as the newly elected Tony Blair is every bit as mesmerizing as hers. Blair comes off so favorably in this film that one is tempted to suspect some sort of collusion on the part of the scriptwriter and the Prime Minister himself. As envisioned by Morgan, Blair is the perfect foil for the queen, a ""modern"" man who is able to ever-so-gently prod her highness into saving her royal arse by doing the right thing politically. For Blair is, if nothing else, a clear-eyed pragmatist who, when all around him are calling for imperial heads to roll, shrewdly knows that a palace coup would not be in the best interests of England at this time.There are fine performances too by James Cromwell as Prince Phillip, Sylvia Syms as the Queen Mum, Alex Jennings as a very milquetoasty Prince Charles, and Helen McCrory as Blair's straightforward, no-nonsense wife who can't understand how her Labor Party husband could be so willing to help the queen extricate herself from the rather sticky wicket she's gotten herself into. The film supplies a generous helping of actual newsreel footage from the time to effectively flesh out the context of the drama.Almost in spite of itself, the film winds up moving us, even though, in terms of style, ""The Queen"" is every bit as dry, brittle - some might even say ""stuffy"" - as the woman who is its subject. Which is precisely why - for all us Anglophiles out here in particular - it makes for such a jolly good show at the cinema.",4,an audience with her majesty,1169856000,"01 27,

A movie about the stoic and staid (and boring?) Queen of England? Only a glass of warm milk could send me to my slumbers more quickly. I nestled down into the comfy seat with my milkduds and diet coke and prepared to take a nap as soon as the lights went dim, but I was delightfully surprised.The acting was first rate and both Michael Sheen and Helen Mirren were exemplary in every way. The most touching moment of the movie was the scene where the queen goes off to grieve privately, in the solitude of the countryside. That scene (and the rest of the movie) is both poignant, memorable and beautifully acted.The real footage of Princess Di was nicely woven into the film, as was the story line. And despite having seen (and read) voluminous amounts of news about her untimely death, this movie showed her passing from a wholly different angle and gave me a new perspective on the whole sad affair.One of the interesting benefits of this flick is it shows with great clarity the relationships (and interrelationships) between the Prime Minister, Parliament, the Queen and her staff.Loved it, loved it, loved it!",5,Gives a bit of insight on those curious folks across the pond,1178323200,"05 5, 2007",2007,1328,"['was', '*literally*', 'dragged', 'theater', 'see', 'movie', 'few', 'months', 'ago', 'friend', 'intellectual', 'type', 'who', 'dedicated', 'life', 'learning', 'know', '20th', 'Century', 'American/English', 'history', 'movie', 'stoic', 'staid', 'boring', 'Queen', 'England', 'Only', 'glass', 'warm', 'milk', 'could', 'send', 'slumbers', 'more', 'quickly', 'nestled', 'down', 'comfy', 'seat', 'milkduds', 'diet', 'coke', 'prepared', 'take', 'nap', 'as', 'soon', 'lights', 'went', 'dim', 'was', 'delightfully', 'surprised.The', 'acting', 'was', 'first', 'rate', 'Michael', 'Sheen', 'Helen', 'Mirren', 'were', 'exemplary', 'way', 'most', 'touching', 'moment', 'movie', 'was', 'scene', 'where', 'queen', 'grieve', 'privately', 'solitude', 'countryside', 'scene', 'rest', 'movie', 'poignant', 'memorable', 'beautifully', 'acted.The', 'real', 'footage', 'Princess', 'Di', 'was', 'nicely', 'woven', 'film', 'was', 'story', 'line', 'having', 'seen', 'read', 'voluminous', 'amounts', 'news', 'untimely', 'death', 'movie', 'showed', 'passing', 'wholly', 'different', 'angle', 'gave', 'new', 'perspective', 'whole', 'sad', 'affair.One', 'interesting', 'benefits', 'flick', 'great', 'clarity', 'relationships', 'interrelationships', 'Prime', 'Minister', 'Parliament', 'Queen', 'staff.Loved', 'loved', 'loved']",The Queen
647763,A3572FTYUQQW3P,B00005JPAM,Royce Callaway,"[0, 2]","I really liked this movie and Helen Mirren -- as usual -- does a fantastic job of portraying the Queen and her royally dysfunctional family as complex anachronisms.  Ms Mirren absolutely deserves the kudo's she has received and could easily capture an oscar for her performance.  She is definitely aided by the makeup and costumes which also deserve mention as being outstanding.  Several things stand out in this movie which I felt served to capture the royal family, its isolation, its dislike of Diana (and why), and its weird family dynamics.  The line ""Diana is even more annoying dead than she was alive"" I thought captured their real dislike of her as a person.  Even more distrubing was the reaction the Queen had to the death of the stag versus her reaction to the death of Diana. Heart felt emotion for the stag, nothing for Diana.  The flap over the flag was a real indication of how this family is trapped by tradition and protocol, which is more important to them than people.  In fact this film, which may be close to the truth, shows that the royal family lives in a gilded cage constructed of tradition, protocol, slavish minions, and isolation from any real people.No one dares tell them the truth or to disturb the tranquility of their placid and unreal existence.  Clearly this is why Diana was so despised by them.  Diana was outgoing, hated the protocol, the stiffness and almost total lack of emotion, love, or family.  She was everything they hated but everything they needed.  Of course they really never understood that and even today they have little grasp of how outdated they are as an institution.  This is a totally dysfunctional family and you see Prince Charles as a grown man incapable of making his own decisions because he must get permission from the Queen.  Prince Phillip -- one minute he is husband and the next he is subject, but clearly he is the most isolated of all -- and likes it that way -- unless he doesn't get his way.  These are living anachronisms and Mirren manages to convey that even they are beginning to realize that.The Tony Blair character (Sheen) is well done and really shows the schizophrenic attitude the Brits have toward the Royal Family.  The PM of England is certainly one of the most powerful men in the world, yet we see him bowing and (gag) kneeling to kiss the hand of the sovereign.  It shows how he has the power but his power is fleeting while the royal family has the influence which remains as long as the monarchy exists.  Which the film clearly shows is on shaky ground due to the isolation of the royal family.I only gave this 4 stars because I thought the cinematography was distracting at times and there were too many gratuitous shots of Diana, but Mirren's performance is well worth the price of admission.",4,A  Queen in a gilded cage,1169856000,"01 27, 2007",2007,2788,"['really', 'liked', 'movie', 'Helen', 'Mirren', 'usual', 'fantastic', 'job', 'portraying', 'Queen', 'royally', 'dysfunctional', 'family', 'complex', 'anachronisms', 'Ms', 'Mirren', 'absolutely', 'kudo', 'received', 'could', 'easily', 'capture', 'oscar', 'performance', 'definitely', 'aided', 'makeup', 'costumes', 'also', 'deserve', 'mention', 'being', 'outstanding', 'Several', 'things', 'stand', 'out', 'movie', 'felt', 'served', 'capture', 'royal', 'family', 'isolation', 'dislike', 'Diana', 'why', 'weird', 'family', 'dynamics', 'line', 'Diana', 'even', 'more', 'annoying', 'dead', 'was', 'alive', 'thought', 'captured', 'real', 'dislike', 'person', 'Even', 'more', 'distrubing', 'was', 'reaction', 'Queen', 'had', 'death', 'stag', 'reaction', 'death', 'Diana', 'Heart', 'felt', 'emotion', 'stag', 'nothing', 'Diana', 'flap', 'flag', 'was', 'real', 'indication', 'how', 'family', 'trapped', 'tradition', 'protocol', 'more', 'important', 'people', 'fact', 'film', 'may', 'be', 'close', 'truth', 'royal', 'family', 'gilded', 'cage', 'constructed', 'tradition', 'protocol', 'slavish', 'minions', 'isolation', 'real', 'people.No', 'one', 'tell', 'truth', 'disturb', 'tranquility', 'placid', 'unreal', 'existence', 'Clearly', 'why', 'Diana', 'was', 'so', 'despised', 'Diana', 'was', 'outgoing', 'hated', 'protocol', 'stiffness', 'almost', 'total', 'lack', 'emotion', 'love', 'family', 'was', 'everything', 'hated', 'everything', 'needed', 'course', 'really', 'never', 'understood', 'even', 'today', 'have', 'little', 'grasp', 'how', 'outdated', 'are', 'institution', 'totally', 'dysfunctional', 'family', 'see', 'Prince', 'Charles', 'grown', 'man', 'incapable', 'making', 'own', 'decisions', 'must', 'get', 'permission', 'Queen', 'Prince', 'Phillip', 'one', 'minute', 'husband', 'next', 'subject', 'clearly', 'most', 'isolated', 'way', ""n't"", 'get', 'way', 'are', 'living', 'anachronisms', 'Mirren', 'convey', 'even', 'are', 'beginning', 'realize', 'that.The', 'Tony', 'Blair', 'character', 'Sheen', 'well', 'done', 'really', 'schizophrenic', 'attitude', 'Brits', 'have', 'Royal', 'Family', 'PM', 'England', 'certainly', 'one', 'most', 'powerful', 'men', 'world', 'see', 'bowing', 'gag', 'kneeling', 'kiss', 'hand', 'sovereign', 'how', 'power', 'power', 'fleeting', 'royal', 'family', 'influence', 'as', 'long', 'monarchy', 'film', 'clearly', 'shaky', 'ground', 'due', 'isolation', 'royal', 'only', 'gave', '4', 'stars', 'thought', 'cinematography', 'was', 'distracting', 'times', 'were', 'too', 'many', 'gratuitous', 'shots', 'Diana', 'Mirren', 'performance', 'well', 'price', 'admission']",The Queen
647764,A387BD735MI50R,B00005JPAM,R. Schultz,"[1, 1]","This movie puts us in Queen Elizabeth's shoes. It shows us the burdens of royal office from her point of view. So it provides an unusual perspective - an alternative to simply gawking at royalty from outside their gates.Helen Mirren brings wonderful gravitas to her role, mixing it with the homely English capacity to push through. She's someone who reigns on the one hand, and who serves her family picnic salad and investigates how to jack her car out of the mud on the other hand. (I didn't even know that the Monarch drives her own car a lot of the time.)There are several commentaries on the DVD. I found the director/writer commentary a little dry, with a sort of unpleasant testiness in the exchange between the two. Robert Lacey's commentary is a bit livelier, so if you only have time to listen to one commentary, I suggest you make it Lacey's account of the history behind some of the royal protocol.Then if you would like to consider the role of monarchy a little further, I suggest you check out the ""The Swan,"" a film starring Alec Guinness and Grace Kelly. This is perhaps Grace Kelly's most overlooked film, but possibly her best. The movie is based on Hungarian writer Ferenc Molnar's famous work. It features a brilliant closing speech by Guinness, arguing that a Queen's duty is to glide alone and serene away from all popular pastime and indulgence.Since Princess Di came on the scene, everyone automatically cast her as - the rose - the swan.

I prefer to keep my feelings to myself.""  -- Queen Elizabeth IIRetaining the dignified privacy that's typical of England's royal family versus showing feelings to an upset and saddened British public that craves monarchial comfort and emotion -- those are the difficult options facing Queen Elizabeth II after Princess Diana's sudden death in this spellbinding movie starring Helen Mirren.Following Diana's death, it's a clash of old-world thinking from the queen and her entourage, up against the newly elected Tony Blair, a ""modern"" and forward-thinking politician who hopes to revolutionize England. In Blair's corner are the people of Great Britain, who loved Diana and now scorn the queen's reluctance to display remorse after the princess' untimely death. In a world filled with 24-hour news cycles and wear-your-heart-on-your-sleeve reality TV shows, the public desires an appearance from Queen Elizabeth II to put a stamp on memorializing the ""people's princess.""But the queen has a mindset and a long history of her own, not all of it regal, and she isn't easily pigeonholed. A former mechanic in World War II and a lover of the outdoors and dogs, Queen Elizabeth II defies convenient stereotype. Though initially her airs reek of snobbishness, Elizabeth is actually a down-to-earth, razor-sharp gal who's filled with the same range of humanity that all of us possess and truly loves and believes in her country. Observing her interaction with people and during personal moments is fascinating and hearkens back to a bygone era that valued familial privacy, honor, restraint and proper decorum.Nuance abounds from Blair as his relationship with the queen evolves and he begins to view her less as an archaic figurehead and more as a noble leader who in many ways can't help her mentality and circumstances. Blair, who starts his term as prime minister a bit in awe of the queen's presence, delicately begins to open up and make suggestions to assist with her predicament of holding on to private family grief versus showing her face to the people of England. Ultimately, though there are some critical words along the way, both the increasingly confident Blair and the staid, honorable queen show themselves to be compromising leaders who only want to do what's right for their country.This glimpse into privileged worlds is made even better by stellar acting by everyone involved. Michael Sheen is practically a carbon copy of the real Tony Blair; Mirren won an Academy Award for her performance as Queen Elizabeth II; and everyone else, from the boorish James Crommwell (the Queen's husband) to the stately Roger Allam (the Queen's adviser) to the brusquely opinionated Helen McCrory (Blair's wife), were spectacular in their roles.",5,A movie fit for a queen,1246060800,"06 27, 2009",2009,2854,"['Nowadays', 'people', 'want', 'glamour', 'tears', 'grand', 'performance', ""'m"", 'not', 'very', 'good', 'never', 'have', 'been', 'prefer', 'keep', 'feelings', 'Queen', 'Elizabeth', 'IIRetaining', 'dignified', 'privacy', 'typical', 'England', 'royal', 'family', 'showing', 'feelings', 'upset', 'saddened', 'British', 'public', 'monarchial', 'comfort', 'emotion', 'are', 'difficult', 'options', 'facing', 'Queen', 'Elizabeth', 'II', 'Princess', 'Diana', 'sudden', 'death', 'spellbinding', 'movie', 'starring', 'Helen', 'Mirren.Following', 'Diana', 'death', 'clash', 'old-world', 'thinking', 'queen', 'entourage', 'up', 'newly', 'elected', 'Tony', 'Blair', 'modern', 'forward-thinking', 'politician', 'who', 'revolutionize', 'England', 'Blair', 'corner', 'are', 'people', 'Great', 'Britain', 'who', 'loved', 'Diana', 'now', 'queen', 'reluctance', 'display', 'remorse', 'princess', 'untimely', 'death', 'world', 'filled', '24-hour', 'news', 'cycles', 'wear-your-heart-on-your-sleeve', 'reality', 'TV', 'shows', 'public', 'appearance', 'Queen', 'Elizabeth', 'II', 'put', 'stamp', 'memorializing', 'people', 'princess', 'queen', 'mindset', 'long', 'history', 'own', 'not', ""n't"", 'easily', 'pigeonholed', 'former', 'mechanic', 'World', 'War', 'II', 'lover', 'outdoors', 'dogs', 'Queen', 'Elizabeth', 'II', 'convenient', 'stereotype', 'initially', 'airs', 'reek', 'snobbishness', 'Elizabeth', 'actually', 'down-to-earth', 'razor-sharp', 'gal', 'who', 'filled', 'same', 'range', 'humanity', 'possess', 'truly', 'loves', 'country', 'Observing', 'interaction', 'people', 'personal', 'moments', 'fascinating', 'hearkens', 'back', 'bygone', 'era', 'valued', 'familial', 'privacy', 'honor', 'restraint', 'proper', 'decorum.Nuance', 'abounds', 'Blair', 'relationship', 'queen', 'evolves', 'view', 'less', 'archaic', 'figurehead', 'more', 'noble', 'leader', 'who', 'many', 'ways', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'mentality', 'circumstances', 'Blair', 'who', 'term', 'prime', 'minister', 'bit', 'awe', 'queen', 'presence', 'delicately', 'open', 'up', 'make', 'suggestions', 'assist', 'predicament', 'holding', 'private', 'family', 'grief', 'versus', 'showing', 'face', 'people', 'England', 'Ultimately', 'are', 'critical', 'words', 'way', 'increasingly', 'confident', 'Blair', 'staid', 'honorable', 'queen', 'show', 'be', 'compromising', 'leaders', 'who', 'only', 'want', 'do', 'what', 'right', 'country.This', 'glimpse', 'privileged', 'worlds', 'made', 'even', 'better', 'stellar', 'acting', 'everyone', 'involved', 'Michael', 'Sheen', 'practically', 'carbon', 'copy', 'real', 'Tony', 'Blair', 'Mirren', 'won', 'Academy', 'Award', 'performance', 'Queen', 'Elizabeth', 'II', 'everyone', 'else', 'boorish', 'James', 'Crommwell', 'Queen', 'husband', 'stately', 'Roger', 'Allam', 'Queen', 'adviser', 'brusquely', 'opinionated', 'Helen', 'McCrory', 'Blair', 'wife', 'were', 'spectacular', 'roles']",The Queen

It is everything its admirers say it is, and more- no problem there.  What IS problematic is the DVD version, specifically its sound balance.  Much of the dialogue is very soft, so naturally one compensates by turning up the volume on the TV.  That works only until Alexandre Desplat's gorgeous score begins to be played; the music booms so loudly that it is physically uncomfortable to hear.  I spent much of my viewing of ""The Queen"" with one wary finger on the volume button of my remote, adjusting it way up for dialogue scenes, and way down for music.  It seems to me that the sound mix is terribly off.  If this mix worked in theatres, it's not working so well on home video, and needs to be re-mixed.  In addition, the extras are more than a bit lacklustre.  There's a fine interview with Helen Mirren, a few more with the cast and crew, and a couple of nice commentary tracks, one of which is by Robert Lacey, the best-known of the Queen's unofficial biographers.  But that's pretty much it.  There's very little about the ""making of"", which would have been fascinating, given that the film so convincingly portrays locations that could not actually be used, like Balmoral.  Again, the film itself is extraordinary- the kind of thoughtful, heartfelt piece of film-making one sees all too seldom in this day and age.

In Great Britain, the Queen is a constitutional monarch of a country without a written constitution, yet America's rightful authors and originators of its ideals were probably nameless Anglican professors at King's College, which is now called Columbia University in New York City.  They were probably royalists too, no doubt.When I saw that the movie's plot would have a lot to do with Princess Diana's death a few years back, I thought I wouldn't like the movie very much, the movie entitled ""The Queen"" should be about The Queen and no one else.  The movie thankfully lives up to its name.  Despite my preconceived notions, I've watched this twice already and think it has not only entertainment value but educational and historical value as well.One of America's forefathers said,  ""A man of real merit is never seen in so favorable a light as through the medium of adversity.""  In this movie, the Queen's adverse circumstances were republican/anti-monarchical forces at work which probably in reality used Princess Diana as a pawn in their game.  I think her brother, Earl Spencer got it right when he said the Press killed her.  My favorite scene in this film was the one with the little girl giving Queen Elizabeth some flowers as the Royal family stopped to read the multitude of notes left among the sea of flowers outside the gates of Buckingham Palace.  This movie also portrays the Queen's relationship with her tenth Prime Minister Tony Blair as being a dynamic one which energized, transformed the monarchy into its present state.Watch also the video clip of Helen Mirren.  I also was sceptical of what she could say, but was pleasantly surprised.  She deserved the Award for Best Actress, and I do agree the movie and other actors deserve kudos as well.

Caught in all the media frenzy is Queen Elizabeth II, not a fan of Diana to begin with.  The Queen wishes to keep the royal family's mourning private, but the public outcry for closure forces her to come out of her privacy shell, return to the palace from their country estate, and make a public statement.The movie provided some private peeks into royal life, such as the queen driving herself up into the boondocks of her estate and getting her jeep stuck in a river.  A vision of the stag her grandsons are hunting leaves her with a haunting vision of its grandeur.  It's hard to image the queen doing such mundane things as driving a jeep or setting a glass of water by her bedside instead of simply snapping her fingers for water whenever she wants it.There's some great acting here too.  Helen Mirren as Queen Elizabeth II and the incomparable James Cromwell as Prince Philip are spectacular in their roles.  The dialogue is a bit stiff at times, but it's hard to tell if its from the scripting or on purpose because of the stiffness and formality of the royal family's, and the British elite's, communications.One strange thing I couldn't help noticing were the phones used as props.  Some were ancient desktop rotary phones and yet in other scenes there were modern cellular phones.  Perhaps I noticed this because I became a bit bored with the sometimes slow and stale progress of the film, but I'm sure if I decided to watch it again I would find another discrepancy.  Overall, it's a good movie to watch once.  I recommend a rent, not a purchase.  3.5 stars.

The film itself uses the death of Princess Diana as a metaphor for the modernization of the UK. Tony Blair (a brilliant Michael Sheen), in convincing HM Elizabeth II to make unprecedented showings of grief to the public, illuminates the UK's gradual distancing from the overly strict traditions of the monarchy and into a new, more Republic type of society. The Queen is aware of this, and through Mirren's nuanced performance we see the Sovereign shift from a protocol-following figurehead to a more accepting and approachable woman.

The Blair-a-like and the Charles-a-like are a bit less convincing. Prince Philip is one of the special treats, so absurdly lost in convention and cliche and so far from anything close to reality.I do not have much for or against the 'royals' but this revelation of their obtuseness is made credible by Mirren's restrained performance. The filmgoer is actually moved to a certain sympathy for the Queen. The most touching moment is when she comes at last to Buckingham and sees the tons of flowers outside which are expressions of love for the deceased Diana. She takes a bouquet from a little girl and asks her 'May I place it for you?' When the little girl says 'It's for you, Ma'am' one sees the Queen suddenly moved, vulnerable and human.There is however one part of the film which did really put me off. It has to do with the hunting business, and involves the killing of a huge elk and the Queen's incidentally being forced to see it hanging after its shot. Yicchh. Totally disgusting.In fact this also points to the objectionable almost inhumane ethic which at times seems to rule among the Royals and the English Aristocracy.In any case this movie is filled with small gems of ridiculousness and absurdity which bring forth pleasant laughter.Apparently we human beings of the lower orders take great enjoyment in laughing at our so- called 'betters'.",4,Highly entertaining escape at the expense of 'the Royals',1170979200,"02 9, 2007",2007,1455,"['enjoyed', 'movie', 'greatly', 'was', 'superbly', 'done', 'Mirren', 'believe', 'Queen', 'Blair-a-like', 'Charles-a-like', 'are', 'bit', 'less', 'convincing', 'Prince', 'Philip', 'one', 'special', 'treats', 'so', 'absurdly', 'lost', 'convention', 'cliche', 'so', 'far', 'anything', 'close', 'reality.I', 'do', 'not', 'have', 'much', ""'royals"", 'revelation', 'obtuseness', 'made', 'credible', 'Mirren', 'restrained', 'performance', 'filmgoer', 'actually', 'moved', 'certain', 'sympathy', 'Queen', 'most', 'touching', 'moment', 'when', 'last', 'Buckingham', 'tons', 'flowers', 'are', 'expressions', 'love', 'deceased', 'Diana', 'bouquet', 'little', 'girl', ""'May"", 'place', 'When', 'little', 'girl', ""Ma'am"", 'one', 'Queen', 'suddenly', 'moved', 'vulnerable', 'however', 'one', 'part', 'film', 'did', 'really', 'put', 'off', 'do', 'hunting', 'business', 'killing', 'huge', 'elk', 'Queen', 'incidentally', 'being', 'forced', 'see', 'hanging', 'shot', 'Yicchh', 'Totally', 'disgusting.In', 'fact', 'also', 'objectionable', 'almost', 'inhumane', 'ethic', 'times', 'rule', 'Royals', 'English', 'Aristocracy.In', 'case', 'movie', 'filled', 'small', 'gems', 'ridiculousness', 'absurdity', 'bring', 'forth', 'pleasant', 'laughter.Apparently', 'human', 'beings', 'lower', 'orders', 'take', 'great', 'enjoyment', 'laughing', 'so-', 'called', ""'betters""]",The Queen

As a history teacher and history buff I am a fan of British history and I am a fan of tradition.  I had a feeling this film would try to tear down British royal tradition and would simply portray both the Royal family and the Queen in a negative light for their actions in the aftermath of the death of Diana.  I couldn't have been more wrong.After leaving the theater I was impressed not only with the plot, the characterization and the cinematography, but I was impressed with Helen's performance.  Having been a fan of her work since Excalibur, I knew she had a great deal of talent.  However, in this film she took the performance to another level.  Oscar winning performance indeed!  She looked like the queen, she sounded like the queen, she transformed herself INTO the queen.The story itself was well written and did a good job of presenting both sides of the issue:  it presented the Queen's side, which is that Diana was no longer a royal and therefor should not receive the ""Royal"" treatment.  It also presented the side of Tony Blair and the English people.  In essence this film is exploring the paradox of an ancient monarch living in the modern world.  While Elizabeth herself is NOT ancient, the monarchy itself, as an institution, is itself ancient.The best part of this film, as other reviewers have noted, is the fact it lets the viewer come to his/her own decision on the events and whether or not the Queen did the right thing.

Despite all of the media hype about the latter, this movie is new, fresh and surprisingly funny.  I laughed out loud a number of times both at the Queen and with her.How can an apple become an orange?  That's what Elizabeth had to do after the sudden and shocking death of her son's ex-wife, whom she had never liked to begin with.  A reserved, imminently proper woman, Elizabeth was completely out of touch with the need of the public to grieve.  She wanted to mourn privately but didn't understand that the country lost Diana too and had to have more closure.  Although she wanted a private service, she needed to bend and come round to something that eventually included pop stars like Elton John -- a 180 turn that was most difficult for her.As always, Helen Mirren is nothing short of amazing.  I've loved her since her early days in Prime Suspect and have watched every episode!  She doesn't disappoint here either; neither does the character who plays Tony Blair, whose name escapes me at the moment.Acting is great, story is wonderful.

Helen Mirren, as just about everybody has rightly noted, turns in another wonderful performance, this time as the restrained ""duty first, self second"" monarch.  Her particular trial here is having to face a clash of civilizations, not between nations as during World War Two, but now within her own country.  A culture of heroes, of maintaining a stiff upper lip during crises and of ""good show, flying colors"" as the behavioral ideal, has slowly eroded and been replaced by one of vulgar celebrity and ""letting it all hang out."" In the middle of this clash stands Tony Blair. He must induce the noble yet now unintentionally comic, because isolated, queen into an awareness of how her society has been ""Oprahfied,"" an insight that would not naturally occur to her since she sees Diana's death as calling for little more than royal privacy and a family removal to Balmoral. Herein lies the movie's subtlety. The high-minded, stoic queen, for all her wit, nonetheless values brute animals more easily, apparently, than she does people. She quickly sees, for example, the beauty of a glorious stag pursued by royal hunters, but has little sympathy for the beautiful Diana pursued by equally murderous reporters.As regards Tony Blair, we have equivalent complexity. For all the film reveals of his political opportunism and readiness to take advantage of changed circumstances, for all the emphasis on generational differences between him and the queen, he is allowed by the well-written script to genuinely recognize the queen's essential fineness. His awareness here leads him in an emotionally charged scene to berate some of his own staff in private after they openly express their shameless glee at the queen's discomfort. At the same time as he recognizes that the ""duty' agenda of the queen will allow him to talk her into doing what has become in present circumstances ""the right thing,"" he also reveals to us his clear awareness that something fine has been compromised in the process.",5,The Clash of Civilizations,1162425600,"11 2, 2006",2006,2031,"['may', 'well', 'be', 'movie', 'year', 'Helen', 'Mirren', 'just', 'everybody', 'rightly', 'noted', 'wonderful', 'performance', 'time', 'restrained', 'duty', 'first', 'second', 'monarch', 'particular', 'trial', 'here', 'having', 'face', 'clash', 'civilizations', 'not', 'nations', 'World', 'War', 'Two', 'now', 'own', 'country', 'culture', 'heroes', 'maintaining', 'stiff', 'upper', 'lip', 'crises', 'good', 'show', 'flying', 'colors', 'behavioral', 'ideal', 'slowly', 'eroded', 'been', 'replaced', 'one', 'vulgar', 'celebrity', 'letting', 'hang', 'out', 'middle', 'clash', 'Tony', 'Blair', 'must', 'induce', 'noble', 'yet', 'now', 'unintentionally', 'comic', 'isolated', 'queen', 'awareness', 'how', 'society', 'been', 'Oprahfied', 'insight', 'would', 'not', 'naturally', 'occur', 'Diana', 'death', 'calling', 'little', 'more', 'royal', 'privacy', 'family', 'removal', 'Balmoral', 'Herein', 'movie', 'subtlety', 'high-minded', 'stoic', 'queen', 'wit', 'nonetheless', 'values', 'brute', 'animals', 'more', 'easily', 'apparently', 'people', 'quickly', 'example', 'beauty', 'glorious', 'stag', 'pursued', 'royal', 'hunters', 'little', 'sympathy', 'beautiful', 'Diana', 'pursued', 'equally', 'murderous', 'reporters.As', 'regards', 'Tony', 'Blair', 'have', 'equivalent', 'complexity', 'film', 'reveals', 'political', 'opportunism', 'readiness', 'take', 'advantage', 'changed', 'circumstances', 'emphasis', 'generational', 'differences', 'queen', 'allowed', 'well-written', 'script', 'genuinely', 'recognize', 'queen', 'essential', 'fineness', 'awareness', 'here', 'emotionally', 'charged', 'scene', 'berate', 'own', 'staff', 'private', 'openly', 'express', 'shameless', 'glee', 'queen', 'discomfort', 'same', 'time', 'duty', 'agenda', 'queen', 'will', 'allow', 'talk', 'doing', 'what', 'become', 'present', 'circumstances', 'right', 'thing', 'also', 'clear', 'awareness', 'something', 'fine', 'been', 'compromised', 'process']",The Queen

The movie has played for months on end in San Francisco art theaters, but never once reached my local suburb, so it probably also never played in small towns across America.  That was my key, along with friends wanting MY personal take on this Best Picture Oscar nominee and Actress winner when it FINALLY got onto DVD.For starters, Helen Mirren gives one of the great performances of all time and richly deserved the thousand awards she has gotten as Queen Elizabeth II.  But she could not do much if Peter Morgan's award-winning script were not as brilliant as it is; the same goes for Frears' magnificent direction.  The movie got Oscar-nominated in several major categories, including Picture and Direction and Actress; I would have added Production Design.  On a mediocre audio commentary, Frears and Morgan curiously ridicule and bad-mouth their own movie in terms of jokes and wrong locations because of a low-budget.  Actually, this is a very handsome-looking film in terms of sets and costumes.  So when you play this DVD, do ignore the Morgan and Frears audio commentary, and maybe try a second one with a British historian and royal family author.  Or just listen to the movie ""cold"".What we have here is a fascinating and insightful drama about the week following Princess Diana's car crash death in 1997 Paris, as filtered through the perspective of the Royal family who are at Balmoral, their hideaway in the Scottish highlands (rich location filming).  Morgan's screenplay gives us a day-by-day portrait of the conflict between the Monarchs and the Blairs, Queen Elizabeth and Prime Minister Tony Blair (a marvelous Michael Sheen), fresh young blood versus a centuries-old conservative monarchy.  We observe, like flies on a wall, how the death of Diana is viewed by both the Queen and Tony.  The Blairs side with the British public, who adored Diana.  They want the flag over Buckingham Palace flown at half-mast, even though the Royal family is in Scotland for the week, and they want a public statement from the Queen.  As more and more flowers pile up outside Buckingham Palace, where people are holding a vigil all week and impatiently waiting for their queen to show herself, Elizabeth reads the various newspapers criticizing her.  She did not like Diana that much and views this as very much a private funeral.  THE QUEEN is rich in character more than plot.Eventually, the public gets its wish for a flag at half-mast, a public TV statement by a queen who barely feels and coldly recites the words she is saying, and a walk among the thousands of people behind police barriers.  The loveliest scene, or at least my favorite, has a little girl giving the Queen a bouquet of flowers.  ""For me?"" she inquires softly.  ""Thank you,"" she says with true sympathy.  Mirren is just towering and flawless in her Oscar-winning role, reason enough to watch THE QUEEN.  But Sheen, and veteran Sylvia Sims and Oscar-nominee James Cromwell, are also excellent as the Queen Mother and Prince Philip, respectively.  The movie should also have gotten a Makeup Oscar nomination since Mirren is beautiful and sexy in real life and looks nothing like Elizabeth.  But with the right white wig and reading glasses and a soft accent, she IS the Queen.  (You might want to watch the film with the English subtitle captions turned on to catch all of the dialogue.)The DVD for THE QUEEN is letterboxed at 1.85, middle-range wide-screen.  (There is also a pan/scan full screen version.)  Like I said earlier, it has two audio commentaries, and the one I played with the director and writer does the movie a real disservice by constantly pointing out all its flaws.  But there is also a very good and informative 20 minute filmmaking documentary and chat with the cast.  It got a PG-13 rating for ""brief language"" which bypassed me; I'd give the film a ""PG"" instead for all ages.  This could be a thrilling English history lesson supplement in high schools and colleges.

No use writing a long description of the plot here as Amazon's review covers it well and the topic is one in which most reviewers will be familar.I'm not sure just how accurate this film is in representing the week of Princess Diana's death and the Royal family's reaction, but it sure sounds and appears very authentic.  These characters spoke and acted much like I imagined they must have done that week.  All cast members are brilliant, the writing is very believable, and the direction makes this rather actionless film seem like a roller coaster ride of sorts as we keep waiting for the next royal fumble.  I love Tony Blair's line of ""Will someone save these people from themselves"" in reference to the royal family.  That line really sums up the film and Blair's role during that critical week.I admire Helen Mirren's acting ability as she had to somehow convey emotion while maintaining an emotionless appearance.  It was a performance not unlike Gregory Peck's Atticus Finch in ""To Kill a Mockingbird"" and well-deserving of her Oscar for Best Actress.  I've always been a fan of her work and of her as a person.  She has put such a positive spin on aging.  May we all age as gracefully as she has.You may not want to buy this film, no matter how good it is, but it is worth renting.

I missed it in the theaters but it plays beautifully on a home screen - even my 27 inch one. The wide screen is not as wide as many others and so the picture shows up well.Especially for baby boomers who remember watching the young Elizabeth being crowed Queen on a small black and white TV set in the early 1950s, this film shows us the mature and intelligent and yet cold looking monarch that she is. As we learn in the short 17-minute ""making of"" documentary, it was not Direct Frears concern that the actors playing Tony Blair and Prince Charles actually look or sound like the real characters. At first you miss Charles large ears but pretty soon you hear what is a good characterization of his voice.On the surface this is a story of the tragic death of Princess Diana but, below that surface is the story of what it is like to be raised in a Palace and be cut off from the modern world.There are two commentary tracks as well. One is by Direct Stephen Frears and talks about the making of the film.

I felt like I was sitting in the room with some of the characters,  spying on them as they went about their business.  The amazing Helen Mirren,  while a tad too tall and slim to be 100% convincing,  nevertheless pulled it off so well that you sometimes think it's Her Majesty playing herself.  Likewise the Tony and Cherie Blair characters.  It was an interesting experience watching the actor who played Charles,  because I felt he looked nothing like Charles,  lacking the prominent ears and nose,  but he looked eerily like the photos one sees of his great uncle the Duke of Windsor,  so it gave a strange feeling of ""wrong character,  right family.""  A little prosthesis to the nose and ears of this actor would have placed him in the ""right on the money"" category as well.I haven't read any of the reviews yet,  but I have a feeling that at least some of them will involve intensive discussion of the obvious emotional retardation of the British Royal family.  The hordes of slavish Diana worshippers will no doubt be out in droves to see how their icon is portrayed.  I was pleased to see that this movie was a well-balanced and fair representation of the interests of all parties concerned.  It showed all facets of the participants: the antiquated,  repressive atmosphere of an ancient lineage that has no clue as to how outmoded it is,  how out of touch with modern life it is,  and how much damage they've done to the lives of all who come in contact with them,  is neatly juxtaposed with its portrayal of a woman who knows no other way but how she has been raised,  and is a basically decent person who has devoted her life to the people she feels she was born to reign over.  It also portrays Diana fairly,  the young and lovely woman thrown into a situation she was not ready for,  the gracious princess who served the world with compassion and humour,  the wonderful mother who gave her sons a decent foundation was fairly balanced with Diana as a neurotic,  needy,  somewhat histrionic jetsetter who used the press for her own gains and then ended up dying almost at their hands.  The movie shows the people involved as they really are,  the best and the worst of them,  real,  three-dimensional,  multi-faceted human beings.

However, she must follow proper protocol and ask him if he'll be prime minister. He says yes,  he and his wife back out of the room (never show your back to the queen), and then Princess Diana dies.She and Prince Philip don't think it's any big deal, but Prince Charles actually has a tear in his eye, and raves about what a great mother she was. This makes the Queen feel as though he's putting down her mothering skills. Anyway, as we all remember, the public went crazy with grief, and expected the royals to share in it. But they didn't, and that's what this whole film is about, which makes it super boring.Advisors are afoot everywhere, and Tony Blair finally talks the queen into coming back to London from her 40,000 estate in Balmoral. She happens to see a 14 point stag that her husband and grandkids have been stalking to get their minds off the death of their mother. Seeing the free and beautiful stag means something to her and she begins to cry (with her back to the camera). What does the stag mean? Does it represent Diana stalked by photographers, which some believe lead to her death? Or does the stag represent Diana as she was when married to Charles - stalked by the royal family trying to get her to change, never show her feelings, and put up with Charles having a mistress? OR, does the stag represent the Queen herself, roped into the monarchy due to her father's death, and feeling it's ""God's will"" that she is royalty, and must represent her people? Which she does by being filthy rich, being waited on hand and foot, and having 40,000 acre estates. The queen finds out later, that the stag was killed, having ""wandered"" off the 40,000 acres to another estate, where a paying guest wounded him, then a servant had to finish  him off. She makes a visit the stag's decapitated body, however, it doesn't show her going to pay her respects to Di. Is the stag a substitute?What upsets the queen so much, is she can't believe that her people are making SUCH a fuss about Di's death, and that now 1 out of 4 have voted to abolish the monarchy. She feels as though she has given her life to these peasants, going around shaking hands with the poor, and they don't even appreciate it.  The queen believes that Great Britain was widely respected for its decorum in the face of tragedy, and that showing your emotions is simply not done.However, to prevent an uprising and perhaps losing her castle, she bitterly and against her better judgment gives in to Tony Blair's (who has gone to the other side and become her champion)advice, goes back to London, looks at some flowers that mourners have placed there, and takes very personally the hand-lettered notes (""your blood is on their hands"").

Very little seems to happen on the surface, while deeply held feelings bubble underneath.This film seems very true-to-life, and only reiterates the irony of the events of 'that week' more than I felt at the time. The ultimate irony - which I felt at the time and now more so - is that Diana would have HATED the royal family pulling her back into their fold as much as they hated doing it. She loved her celebrity, without a doubt, and enjoyed the way she overshadowed the 'Establishment.' But I don't think she meant to ever become a part of it again - regardless of the fact that she was the mother of the future king (William). It occurred to me at the time that she would have hated her ex-husband going to France to claim her remains and bring them back to England. Even though her sisters were with Charles, in retrospect, perhaps her brother should have done it.Some random thoughts:1) Now we know the answer to the long-standing question 'What DOES she carry in that purse?'. The answer is --- a pen (to update the speech she is eventually talked into making about Diana).2) What does the Queen use to touch up her nose after a cry? Her Hermes scarf, at least while she's alone in the Scottish countryside after her Land Rover breaks down.3) Try as I may, I really never 'got' the subplot about the stag. What was it meant to symbolize? The stalking and subsequent death of Diana, the possible extinction of the monarchy...?4) I was very surprised at the level of anti-monarchy feelings, had no idea Cherie Blair was so blatant.All the parts are well-cast, especially Helen Mirren; her ability to get inside the skin of Elizabeth II was a wonder. She definitely deserved the Oscar for this performance. I appreciated the sensitivity with which the film dealt with Princes William and Harry, but was a bit surprised at the generous portrayal of Prince Charles and the almost-venomous way Prince Philip was portrayed. All in all, I think the film gives a sympathetic view to the Queen's (and the monarchy's) feelings about the death of Diana.",5,Random Thoughts on The Queen,1183852800,"07 8, 2007",2007,2361,"['get', 'random', 'slightly', 'sarcastic', 'comments', 'directed', 'one', 'particular', 'certainly', 'meaning', 'disrespect', 'mentioned', 'let', 'say', 'loved', 'film', 'think', 'meant', 'who', 'appreciate', 'good', 'Jane', 'Austen', 'book', 'film', 'where', 'people', 'think', 'feel', 'opposed', 'act', 'Very', 'little', 'happen', 'surface', 'deeply', 'held', 'feelings', 'bubble', 'underneath.This', 'film', 'very', 'true-to-life', 'only', 'irony', 'events', 'week', 'more', 'felt', 'time', 'ultimate', 'irony', 'felt', 'time', 'now', 'more', 'so', 'Diana', 'would', 'have', 'HATED', 'royal', 'family', 'pulling', 'back', 'fold', 'as', 'much', 'hated', 'doing', 'loved', 'celebrity', 'doubt', 'enjoyed', 'way', 'overshadowed', ""'Establishment"", 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'meant', 'ever', 'become', 'part', 'again', 'regardless', 'fact', 'was', 'mother', 'future', 'king', 'William', 'occurred', 'time', 'would', 'have', 'hated', 'ex-husband', 'going', 'France', 'claim', 'remains', 'bring', 'back', 'England', 'Even', 'sisters', 'were', 'Charles', 'retrospect', 'perhaps', 'brother', 'should', 'have', 'done', 'it.Some', 'random', 'thoughts:1', 'Now', 'know', 'answer', 'long-standing', 'question', 'DOES', 'carry', 'purse', 'answer', 'pen', 'update', 'speech', 'eventually', 'talked', 'making', 'Diana', '.2', 'What', 'Queen', 'use', 'touch', 'up', 'nose', 'cry', 'Hermes', 'scarf', 'least', 'alone', 'Scottish', 'countryside', 'Land', 'Rover', 'down.3', 'Try', 'may', 'really', 'never', ""'got"", 'subplot', 'stag', 'What', 'was', 'meant', 'symbolize', 'stalking', 'subsequent', 'death', 'Diana', 'possible', 'extinction', 'monarchy', '4', 'was', 'very', 'surprised', 'level', 'anti-monarchy', 'feelings', 'had', 'idea', 'Cherie', 'Blair', 'was', 'so', 'blatant.All', 'parts', 'are', 'well-cast', 'especially', 'Helen', 'Mirren', 'ability', 'get', 'skin', 'Elizabeth', 'II', 'was', 'wonder', 'definitely', 'deserved', 'Oscar', 'performance', 'appreciated', 'sensitivity', 'film', 'dealt', 'Princes', 'William', 'Harry', 'was', 'bit', 'surprised', 'generous', 'portrayal', 'Prince', 'Charles', 'almost-venomous', 'way', 'Prince', 'Philip', 'was', 'portrayed', 'think', 'film', 'sympathetic', 'view', 'Queen', 'monarchy', 'feelings', 'death', 'Diana']",The Queen

647796,A2JFDCLA9PZGQ0,B00005JPAM,Teemacs,"[3, 3]","The joy of this great piece of cinema is watching the violent collision of two parallel worlds coexisting in the present-day UK, the world of upper-class Victorian privilege and devotion to duty inhabited by the UK Royal Family, complete with its huntin', shootin', fishin', and the everyday world of all the rest of us. This is brilliantly captured in this film, especially with the flashes between the mannered, genteel Royal household and the chaotic, refreshingly normal Blair household.The scenes in which collision first occurs are priceless; the slightly gauche young Tony Blair, fresh from a landslide General Election victory, confronts his Sovereign whose first Prime Minister was Winston Churchill, the anti-Royalist Cherie Blair sways in an incredibly precarious curtsey and then the Blairs back out of The Presence in the most awkward manner, because nobody turns his or her back on HM (""And it's ""Ma'am"", as in ""ham"", not ""Marm"" as in ""farm"", as a uniformed flunkey reminds them).The greater collision was triggered by the death of Diana, and the sudden realisation by the Royals that something more than regal aloofness and stiff upper lips were necessary. Having apparently grown up with an assumption of the right to rule as their due and that the public would soon see things their way, the Windsors were suddenly confronted by the fact that the public saw Diana differently and what it thought of her - and them - mattered very much. In the end, you are left with the impression that Elizabeth Windsor, with the urging of Tony Blair, had learned something - but could perhaps usefully learn a bit more.This is naturally a work of fiction - the Queen basically adheres very well to the formula of Walter Bagehot, the great 19th century editor of ""The Economist"", that not too much light should be allowed in for fear of destroying the magic, and so never gives interviews and rarely allows personal glimpses. We therefore have no idea as to what was said and thought. However, I found it all works extremely well. All the actors are excellent, especially Helen Mirren, thoroughly meriting her Oscar and proving that there really is nothing like a Dame. She manages marvellously the complex part of Elizabeth II, by the grace of God, Sovereign of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, Defender of the Faith, etc., etc, etc., with its mixture of absolute devotion to duty, traditional values, conservatism, basic shyness and elitism. James Cromwell does a good job of Prince Philip, whose idea of helping Diana's sons cope with her death is to take them out to shoot things, Sylvia Sims makes a delightful Queen Mother and  Charles is given a sympathetic portrayal, although it's a pity that they didn't get someone who looks more like him (but then, who would want to?).All in all, a very good film which leaves one (this one anyway) wondering why the ordinary British people accept with relatively little complaint this bunch of toffs with virtually nothing in common with them (same number of heads, arms, ears, etc., but that's all) as their rulers. But then, the US public has recently twice voted into its Presidency the US equivalent of royalty, who has nothing in common with them and whose sole interest is lining the pockets of other rich guys. At least the Brits have (genuine) class.

They are easily the two best actresses working in film. I would think directors would be bending over backward for the opportunity to work with these two accomplished thespians. Instead, they are more easily able to get films with Kirsten Dunst and Julie Stiles made. Amazing. It just isn't the same, folks. It isn't the same.""The Queen"", the new film from director Stephen Frears (""Dirty, Pretty Things"", ""The Crying Game""), concentrates on the week after Princess Diana's death. As the film progresses, we watch Queen Elizabeth (Helen Mirren), Prince Phillip (James Cromwell) and Prince Charles (Alex Jennings) deal with the loss of someone in their lives as you would expect British Royalty to deal with such a thing, with a stiff upper lip. But this period is also significant in British history for another reason; a new Labour Prime Minister has just been elected. Tony Blair (Michael Sheen) recognizes Diana's death will not remain the isolated family affair the Royals insist it will be. Through many conversations, Blair attempts to get the Queen to make some sort of statement regarding her former step-daughter's death, to make some sign for the benefit of a grieving public. But as she and the family are spending the summer at their estate in Balmoral, Scotland, she remains steadfast in her feeling that this is a private family affair and any public grief will soon wear off.""The Queen"" is a remarkable film for two reasons; the first and foremost is Helen Mirren. She is, once again, superb. If she isn't at least nominated for an Oscar, there is something seriously wrong with the whole system.There is some humor in the film, but it is derived from watching the rigid ceremony and outdated tradition surrounding the family. Mirren could easily have portrayed the role as a jokey, caricature of the Queen, but her performance is much better, much more layered than that. She successfully paints a portrait of the Queen, and what her life is as a Royal, making the character, both good and bad, seem real. As she portrays the monarch, we watch as she moves through a life surrounded by tradition, a cocoon of advisors and servants, buffering her from the public, further reinforcing her feelings everything is going well. Convinced she is right, she doesn't heed the advice of her new Prime Minister, a figure she clearly `tolerates'. But as he continues to press the case, she gradually realizes he may be speaking the truth.Mirren does a brilliant job of making us understand this woman's feelings. It seems perfectly understandable she would be so reluctant to believe the public does not require some statement from the Royal family, this is a private family affair and the British people are stalwart and dignified. As she gradually, very gradually, realizes perhaps she does need to address the public, this also makes sense. She remembers she is in the public eye, a spokesperson for the people, perhaps she should say something.You have to remember Queen Elizabeth is part of a monarchy that has ruled England for centuries. There are traditions involved with the position and her life has been very different from a normal person. So, while her behavior may seem odd at first, we understand it through Mirren's performance. We certainly may not agree with it, but we see how it could happen. Throughout, there are many references to this, reminding us of the tradition the House of Windsor is steeped in.Mirren is simply outstanding. Have I said that already?The other person who is largely responsible for this film's success is director Stephen Frears. He keeps the film moving at a fast clip and the film is more entertaining for it. Usually, when you go to a biopic, you expect the film to reach the 2 hour plus mark. ""The Queen"" is a sprightly 95 minutes long. Because of this, Frears smartly concentrates on the week after Diana's death. He doesn't attempt to paint a complete picture of the monarch's life, choosing instead to illuminate this period. Because of this choice, we actually learn more about Queen Elizabeth and her family. The tragedy of Diana's death makes everything seem a little amplified, as though they are experiencing things they would normally experience over the course of a couple of years. Throughout, as we watch them deal with their traditions, and each other, we learn a lot about the traditions of their family, and the history.Shortly after we meet the Queen and her new Prime Minister, the film abruptly shifts to the night of Diana's death. We watch as various images pop up, giving us an accurate feeling of what that night was like. Because Frears uses a quick series of images, we do some of the work, filling in the blanks with our imagination. It is an effective trick and works well to give us information and to keep the film moving along.Throughout the film, the focus shifts back and forth from the Queen and the Windsors, to Blair, his staff and his wife. We quickly realize that Blair is trying to get through to the Queen for a number of reasons. The most important is that he genuinely feels the public needs to hear from her. But the political cache of getting the Queen to change her ways is not lost upon the young Labour official. When this eventually happens, a small smile crosses his lips. His wife is also incredulous about why he would care so much about the Queen. He notes that without her, he would not be possible, so it is in his best interest to help her maintain an air of dignity. I bring this up because it shows Frears is also interested in showing the politics of England at this time, and how all of these events affect one another.""The Queen"" is a great film, much more sprightly, interesting and human that the traditional biopic. Now it is up to you to discover what the thousands of people who have been packing the limited engagement theaters have already discovered.",5,Long Live Helen Mirren,1160438400,"10 10,

647802,A3KJ6JAZPH382D,B00005JPAM,"Tim Brough ""author and music buff""","[0, 0]","Helen Mirren won the Oscar of her portrayal of Queen Elizabeth for a very good reason. She stripped away all pretense of being a glamorous actress and made QE look like a human. As England rises in resentment over the Palace's lack of response concerning the death of Princess Diana, the Royal Family greet the public response as a passing phase. Just how greatly they misunderstood the public's love of Diana completely escapes them, to the point where every concession is met with greater derision within the walls of the royal confines. ""Celebrities and homosexuals,"" sneers Prince Phillip when he hears of the attendees planning on attending Diana's funeral.The focus of ""The Queen,"" however, remains Queen Elizabeth. She gains humanity and humility as the movie progresses. She is hard as nails (the car breakdown scene is a hoot), but still feels compassion for a stag that is being hunted on the grounds. (The overbearing allegory of the stag and Diana is a bit much, though.) The prime moment of realization comes from a young girl with flowers in front of Buckingham Palace, and it also emphasizes what a splendid job Mirren did...she conveys so many emotions in just a few expressions and no words.Mention also should be given to Hugh Cromwell, who plays Prince Phillip as a stuffy old coot with a typical out of touch Monarch's snobbery and Michael Sheen as Tony Blair. Sheen shows Blair transforming from radical modernizer into a fan of the details of royalty very effectively. There is also an interesting moment near the end of the movie when Queen Elizabeth tells Blair that someday the press and the people will inevitably turn on you. While we aren't certain if that conversation ever took place, it seems deliciously prophetic none the less.",4,Beauty and Royalty,1182729600,"06 25, 2007",2007,1760,"['Helen', 'Mirren', 'won', 'Oscar', 'portrayal', 'Queen', 'Elizabeth', 'very', 'good', 'reason', 'stripped', 'away', 'pretense', 'being', 'glamorous', 'actress', 'made', 'QE', 'look', 'human', 'England', 'resentment', 'Palace', 'lack', 'response', 'concerning', 'death', 'Princess', 'Diana', 'Royal', 'Family', 'greet', 'public', 'response', 'passing', 'phase', 'Just', 'how', 'greatly', 'misunderstood', 'public', 'love', 'Diana', 'completely', 'point', 'where', 'concession', 'met', 'greater', 'derision', 'walls', 'royal', 'confines', 'Celebrities', 'homosexuals', 'sneers', 'Prince', 'Phillip', 'when', 'attendees', 'planning', 'attending', 'Diana', 'funeral.The', 'focus', 'Queen', 'however', 'Queen', 'Elizabeth', 'gains', 'humanity', 'humility', 'movie', 'hard', 'nails', 'car', 'breakdown', 'scene', 'hoot', 'still', 'compassion', 'stag', 'being', 'hunted', 'grounds', 'overbearing', 'allegory', 'stag', 'Diana', 'bit', 'much', 'though', 'prime', 'moment', 'realization', 'young', 'girl', 'flowers', 'front', 'Buckingham', 'Palace', 'also', 'what', 'splendid', 'job', 'Mirren', 'did', 'conveys', 'so', 'many', 'emotions', 'just', 'few', 'expressions', 'words.Mention', 'also', 'should', 'be', 'given', 'Hugh', 'Cromwell', 'who', 'Prince', 'Phillip', 'stuffy', 'old', 'coot', 'typical', 'touch', 'Monarch', 'snobbery', 'Michael', 'Sheen', 'Tony', 'Blair', 'Sheen', 'Blair', 'transforming', 'radical', 'modernizer', 'fan', 'details', 'royalty', 'very', 'effectively', 'also', 'interesting', 'moment', 'end', 'movie', 'when', 'Queen', 'Elizabeth', 'Blair', 'someday', 'press', 'people', 'will', 'inevitably', 'turn', 'are', ""n't"", 'certain', 'conversation', 'ever', 'took', 'place', 'deliciously', 'prophetic', 'none', 'less']",The Queen

It plays out patiently over a very emotional issue for many people around the world: the death of Princess Diana and the reaction of the English monarchy.Peter Morgan's script does an excellent job of presenting all sides of an historical moment. It never feels as if he's trying to garner sympathy for any parties involved. We see the queen trying to deal with the situation in the way that she sees fit: the most traditional, nonreactionary, unemotional way. We see Tony Blair trying to convince her that this is not the proper way to proceed. We see the public's reaction to Diana's death.What struck me the most about the film was how the power of the media was displayed. In numerous scenes, the prime minister is shown scanning the headlines for the public's reactions. The queen is shown watching news reports of people's reactions. When Tony Blair attempts to side with the Queen slightly and help her the newspapers don't report it, they continue to report the queen's lack of action. To me, this brought into the equation the very real idea that while the government may rule, the media can decide what to say about events, and therefore effect public opinion in a much more direct way.This film moves slowly, but is never boring. It definitely opens up many topics of conversation.

647818,A3ADK3ZTJ87915,B00005JPAM,"Zinta Aistars ""Writer & Editor""","[5, 5]","Helen Mirren deservedly wins the award for best actress for her lead in ""The Queen,"" produced by Stephen Frears. The resemblence to the Queen of England, Elizabeth II, is remarkable in her physical appearance, but also in Mirren's every mannerism, her gaze, her speech. Mirren manages to capture this cool and highly controlled living historical figure with the subtle nuances that indicate warm(ish) blood beneath. It would have been easy to portray Elizabeth II as stiff royalty of robotic sensibilities, but instead, Mirren manages to bring to her a sense of a woman imprisoned by her upbringing and the constraints of her position. There is just a glimmer, now and then, of feeling beneath the proper etiquette, a glimpse of humanity beneath the thick mask of tradition that allows for almost none.The Queen is portrayed at a time when tradition is forced to crack under ""modernization,"" a favorite term of Tony Blair's (Michael Sheen), new and somewhat awkward prime minister playing a respectful if challenging second fiddle to Her Majesty. Princess Diana has just died in a horrific car accident, and the royal family is not prepared for a nation in grief, a nation, perhaps even spreading to a global community, that has little tolerance left for British cool. There is a sense of blame that sends electric currents through the Palace, who had expected support for their restraint but found instead their centuries old status threatened. Pushed to the limits of her tightly bound comfort zone, Elizabeth II manages to maintain royal grace under fire. A scene in which the Queen is stranded in the country as her vehicle breaks down midstream, and Her Majesty sits in the grass indulging in a secret moment of tears, is exquisite. Another, as she strolls beside the gates outside the Palace to view the flowers and cards left for Diana, many of which are crassly critical of the royal family, but still manages to reconnect to her people is a tension brought beautifully to a resolution - with a glance, with the most minimal nod of acknowledgment, with the acceptance of flowers from an admiring child.A truly incredible performance, and a refreshingly new perspective on a time when media showed us only one view, from the outside of Buckingham Palace looking in.",5,Cool Brilliance,1177632000,"04 27, 2007",2007,2272,"['Helen', 'Mirren', 'deservedly', 'award', 'best', 'actress', 'lead', 'Queen', 'produced', 'Stephen', 'Frears', 'resemblence', 'Queen', 'England', 'Elizabeth', 'II', 'remarkable', 'physical', 'appearance', 'also', 'Mirren', 'mannerism', 'gaze', 'speech', 'Mirren', 'capture', 'cool', 'highly', 'controlled', 'living', 'historical', 'figure', 'subtle', 'nuances', 'indicate', 'warm', 'ish', 'blood', 'beneath', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'easy', 'portray', 'Elizabeth', 'II', 'stiff', 'royalty', 'robotic', 'sensibilities', 'instead', 'Mirren', 'bring', 'sense', 'woman', 'imprisoned', 'upbringing', 'constraints', 'position', 'just', 'glimmer', 'now', 'then', 'feeling', 'proper', 'etiquette', 'glimpse', 'humanity', 'thick', 'mask', 'tradition', 'almost', 'none.The', 'Queen', 'portrayed', 'time', 'when', 'tradition', 'forced', 'crack', 'modernization', 'favorite', 'term', 'Tony', 'Blair', 'Michael', 'Sheen', 'new', 'somewhat', 'awkward', 'prime', 'minister', 'playing', 'respectful', 'challenging', 'second', 'fiddle', 'Majesty', 'Princess', 'Diana', 'just', 'died', 'horrific', 'car', 'accident', 'royal', 'family', 'not', 'prepared', 'nation', 'grief', 'nation', 'perhaps', 'even', 'spreading', 'global', 'community', 'little', 'tolerance', 'left', 'British', 'cool', 'sense', 'blame', 'electric', 'currents', 'Palace', 'who', 'had', 'expected', 'support', 'restraint', 'found', 'instead', 'centuries', 'old', 'status', 'threatened', 'Pushed', 'limits', 'tightly', 'bound', 'comfort', 'zone', 'Elizabeth', 'II', 'maintain', 'royal', 'grace', 'fire', 'scene', 'Queen', 'stranded', 'country', 'vehicle', 'breaks', 'down', 'midstream', 'Her', 'Majesty', 'grass', 'indulging', 'secret', 'moment', 'tears', 'exquisite', 'gates', 'Palace', 'view', 'flowers', 'cards', 'left', 'Diana', 'many', 'are', 'crassly', 'critical', 'royal', 'family', 'still', 'reconnect', 'people', 'tension', 'brought', 'beautifully', 'resolution', 'glance', 'most', 'minimal', 'nod', 'acknowledgment', 'acceptance', 'flowers', 'admiring', 'child.A', 'truly', 'incredible', 'performance', 'refreshingly', 'new', 'perspective', 'time', 'when', 'media', 'showed', 'only', 'one', 'view', 'outside', 'Buckingham', 'Palace', 'looking']",The Queen
