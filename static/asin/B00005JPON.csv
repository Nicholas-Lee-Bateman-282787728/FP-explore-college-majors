I can hear all sorts of  comments coming to roost:  ""Lame and predictable 'Dog' ,...What a dog!...too doggone routine,...you can't teach these screenwriters new tricks...let this one roll over and play dead.""  I have to admit that this movie is often dumb (and I usually don't like dumb movies), but it often contains some decent family entertainment.  The jokes are nearly all dumb, but at least they are effective nearly half of the time.  While there are enough ""spots"" to tarnish this film, it has some solid components and redeeming qualities.The premise isn't unusual.  Prima donna canine movie star Rexxx has an implausible accident during a stunt in a scene for a recent movie.  Stray from the cast and crew, he hits the road and comes into the company of ""Rescue 26/Engine 55,"" a neighborhood fire station whose existence is teetering on the contingency of budget cuts of all things.  Following him is his ambitious and greedy agent who all but gives up the diva dog for good.  Above the fire station is an administrator who has a plan of his own for the firehouse.While the plot sometimes makes one want to howl, the acting is laudably in prime shape.  Josh Halverson (of 'Bridge to Terabithia' fame) ably plays Shane Fahey, a hapless son of the fire chief, who is scarred by the deaths of his mother and his uncle, whom his father replaced.  Coming across a self-willed stray is hardly compensation for the pre-adolescent who only has a girl love interest and a concerned, but stern father to help him commiserate his inner wounds.  Bruce Greenwood gives us a laudably earnest performance as his father, Connor, who must wear his badge warily with all the problems set before them.Whether campy or serious, the flashback scenes are particularly well done, and the dangers presented have enough direness without being a hazard to young psyches.  At its meatier times, they get tongue-in-cheek as they bolster the formula even with Rex's portfolio.  Having starred in 'The Fast and the Furriest' and 'Jurassic Bark,' Rex's fate lies whether he chooses the primrose path and the red carpet treatment or keeping it real where he's needed at the fire station.  There's also a mock funeral scene that pokes fun of everyone involved.  'Firehouse Dog' is just ridiculous and real enough to work to keep the family satisfied, even if too many of the jokes remind one of the slick slapstick scenes when fire fighters slide down the firehouse pole.",3,Lame but Lovable 'Dog',1190505600,"09 23, 2007",2007,2516,"['Critics', 'will', 'undoubtedly', 'have', 'bone', 'pick', 'Firehouse', 'Dog', 'can', 'hear', 'sorts', 'comments', 'coming', 'roost', 'Lame', 'predictable', ""'Dog"", 'What', 'dog', 'too', 'doggone', 'routine', 'ca', ""n't"", 'teach', 'screenwriters', 'new', 'tricks', 'let', 'one', 'roll', 'play', 'dead', 'have', 'admit', 'movie', 'often', 'dumb', 'usually', 'do', ""n't"", 'like', 'dumb', 'movies', 'often', 'decent', 'family', 'entertainment', 'jokes', 'are', 'nearly', 'dumb', 'least', 'are', 'effective', 'nearly', 'half', 'time', 'are', 'enough', 'spots', 'tarnish', 'film', 'solid', 'components', 'redeeming', 'qualities.The', 'premise', ""n't"", 'unusual', 'Prima', 'donna', 'canine', 'movie', 'star', 'Rexxx', 'implausible', 'accident', 'stunt', 'scene', 'recent', 'movie', 'Stray', 'cast', 'crew', 'road', 'company', 'Rescue', '26/Engine', '55', 'neighborhood', 'fire', 'station', 'existence', 'teetering', 'contingency', 'budget', 'cuts', 'things', 'Following', 'ambitious', 'greedy', 'agent', 'who', 'up', 'diva', 'dog', 'good', 'fire', 'station', 'administrator', 'who', 'plan', 'own', 'firehouse.While', 'plot', 'sometimes', 'one', 'want', 'howl', 'acting', 'laudably', 'prime', 'shape', 'Josh', 'Halverson', ""'Bridge"", 'Terabithia', 'fame', 'ably', 'Shane', 'Fahey', 'hapless', 'son', 'fire', 'chief', 'who', 'scarred', 'deaths', 'mother', 'uncle', 'whom', 'father', 'replaced', 'Coming', 'self-willed', 'stray', 'hardly', 'compensation', 'pre-adolescent', 'who', 'only', 'girl', 'love', 'interest', 'concerned', 'stern', 'father', 'help', 'commiserate', 'inner', 'wounds', 'Bruce', 'Greenwood', 'laudably', 'earnest', 'performance', 'father', 'Connor', 'who', 'must', 'wear', 'badge', 'warily', 'problems', 'set', 'them.Whether', 'campy', 'serious', 'flashback', 'scenes', 'are', 'particularly', 'well', 'done', 'dangers', 'presented', 'have', 'enough', 'direness', 'being', 'hazard', 'young', 'psyches', 'meatier', 'times', 'get', 'tongue-in-cheek', 'bolster', 'formula', 'even', 'Rex', 'portfolio', 'Having', 'starred', ""'The"", 'Fast', 'Furriest', ""'Jurassic"", 'Bark', 'Rex', 'fate', 'primrose', 'path', 'red', 'carpet', 'treatment', 'keeping', 'real', 'where', 'needed', 'fire', 'station', 'also', 'mock', 'funeral', 'scene', 'fun', 'everyone', 'involved', 'Dog', 'just', 'ridiculous', 'real', 'enough', 'work', 'keep', 'family', 'satisfied', 'even', 'too', 'many', 'jokes', 'remind', 'one', 'slick', 'slapstick', 'scenes', 'when', 'fire', 'fighters', 'slide', 'firehouse', 'pole']",Firehouse Dog (Widescreen Edition)
655123,A37PV5GMP2ILJC,B00005JPON,Amanda Richards,"[15, 16]","This is a good old fashioned family movie about a boy and a dog, and of course, like all shaggy dog tales, the mutt is the star.  Celebrity dog Rexxx (note the x's) chucks in his glamorous poodle-filled life to become a firehouse dog, the only fringe benefits being that he can chase the fire-engine and investigate a lot of hydrants.He adopts a young boy named Shane, who is rather unwilling at first, but after some aerial acrobatics, a few search and rescues and a lot of canine flatulence, Shane finally gets around to appreciating Rexxx, even though he mistakenly believes his name to be Dewey.  ""Dewey"" soon rises to the rank of mascot, and is duly appreciated by the humans, especially the inhabitants of the Dogpatch Fire Station, who although friendly enough, don't seem to be the sharpest tools in the shed.There are two other stories filling out the movie, one being the relationship between Shane and his firefighter father, and the other being the mystery of the curiously contagious conflagrations in the Dogpatch area.Corny and cheesy in places, but never whiny, this is a movie you can watch with small kids (your teenagers may be otherwise occupied), but as you will see, the star of this movie is undoubtedly the hot mutt.Amanda Richards, September 1, 2007",4,Hot Mutt,1188604800,"09 1, 2007",2007,1274,"['good', 'old', 'fashioned', 'family', 'movie', 'boy', 'dog', 'course', 'shaggy', 'dog', 'tales', 'mutt', 'star', 'Celebrity', 'dog', 'Rexxx', 'note', 'x', 'chucks', 'glamorous', 'poodle-filled', 'life', 'become', 'firehouse', 'dog', 'only', 'fringe', 'benefits', 'being', 'can', 'chase', 'fire-engine', 'investigate', 'lot', 'hydrants.He', 'adopts', 'young', 'boy', 'named', 'Shane', 'who', 'rather', 'unwilling', 'first', 'aerial', 'acrobatics', 'few', 'search', 'rescues', 'lot', 'canine', 'flatulence', 'Shane', 'finally', 'appreciating', 'Rexxx', 'even', 'mistakenly', 'name', 'be', 'Dewey', 'Dewey', 'soon', 'rank', 'mascot', 'duly', 'appreciated', 'humans', 'especially', 'inhabitants', 'Dogpatch', 'Fire', 'Station', 'who', 'friendly', 'enough', 'do', ""n't"", 'seem', 'be', 'sharpest', 'tools', 'are', 'two', 'other', 'stories', 'filling', 'out', 'movie', 'one', 'being', 'relationship', 'Shane', 'firefighter', 'father', 'other', 'being', 'mystery', 'curiously', 'contagious', 'conflagrations', 'Dogpatch', 'area.Corny', 'cheesy', 'places', 'never', 'whiny', 'movie', 'can', 'watch', 'small', 'kids', 'teenagers', 'may', 'be', 'otherwise', 'occupied', 'will', 'see', 'star', 'movie', 'undoubtedly', 'hot', 'mutt.Amanda', 'Richards', 'September', '1', '2007']",Firehouse Dog (Widescreen Edition)

655125,A4IQXCCXDEAKW,B00005JPON,Anne P. Mitchell,"[0, 0]","We had avoided Firehouse Dog in the theatres because of all the reviews we had read that talked about the sophomoric jokes about the dog eating a pot of chili and the ensuing flatulence.Clearly, whoever wrote those reviews had not actually watched the movie - at least not very closely - because in the first place it wasn't chili, and in the second place, yes, there are some gas-passing bits in Firehouse Dog, but they are fairly minor and fast, and are definitely not major enough to warrant avoiding this movie.[Note: On watching this a second time, I noticed that during the stew-eating scene, the dog actually turns around and poops in the pot. That's definitely uncool, but it would be easy to distract a child for that very brief ""on the table eating the stew scene.""]Firehouse Dog was definitely a surprise, because I had my finger on ""pause"" for the first several scenes, until I realized that this movie was not only nowhere near as bad as I'd thought, but actually was an ok movie, and it has a pretty sweet storyline.The premise is that the main character, Shane, a pre-adolescent boy, is headed down the trouble lane, cutting school, and being ignored by his fire chief single-father. Not only has his mother disappeared (and that's all that we hear about that, it is very subtle in that regard), but (and this sets the tone of the entire movie), the previous fire chief was his uncle (his father's brother), who lost his life in the line of duty. His father believes that it is arson and related to a series of fires that have happened since, and the audience sees devices made with watches and cigarette packs that clue the audience in to the fact that is father is right.Through mechanisms that I won't reveal, Shane ends up with a 'stray' dog, and learns responsibilty, while his father comes to realize that he has basically ignored his son and his son's needs since his brother passed away.In the end it's a sweet story line, although there are some intense moments (especially at the end, when Shane gets trapped in a fire set by the arsonist (whom he of course has identified, and in the end helps to apprehend)), but of course in the end everyone is safe, and they live happily ever after.I personally wouldn't recommend this, however for children below the age of 10, or 9 at the youngest.Anne[...]",4,"A Crunchy Parental Review of ""Firehouse Dog""",1200700800,"01 19, 2008",2008,2322,"['had', 'avoided', 'Firehouse', 'Dog', 'theatres', 'reviews', 'had', 'read', 'talked', 'sophomoric', 'jokes', 'dog', 'eating', 'pot', 'chili', 'ensuing', 'flatulence.Clearly', 'whoever', 'wrote', 'reviews', 'had', 'not', 'actually', 'watched', 'movie', 'least', 'not', 'very', 'closely', 'first', 'place', 'was', ""n't"", 'chili', 'second', 'place', 'yes', 'are', 'gas-passing', 'bits', 'Firehouse', 'Dog', 'are', 'fairly', 'minor', 'fast', 'are', 'definitely', 'not', 'major', 'enough', 'warrant', 'avoiding', 'movie', '[', 'Note', 'watching', 'second', 'time', 'noticed', 'stew-eating', 'scene', 'dog', 'actually', 'poops', 'pot', 'definitely', 'uncool', 'would', 'be', 'easy', 'distract', 'child', 'very', 'brief', 'table', 'eating', 'stew', 'scene', ']', 'Firehouse', 'Dog', 'was', 'definitely', 'surprise', 'had', 'finger', 'pause', 'first', 'several', 'scenes', 'realized', 'movie', 'was', 'not', 'only', 'nowhere', 'as', 'bad', ""'d"", 'thought', 'actually', 'was', 'ok', 'movie', 'pretty', 'sweet', 'storyline.The', 'premise', 'main', 'character', 'Shane', 'pre-adolescent', 'boy', 'headed', 'down', 'trouble', 'lane', 'cutting', 'school', 'being', 'ignored', 'fire', 'chief', 'single-father', 'Not', 'only', 'mother', 'disappeared', 'hear', 'very', 'subtle', 'regard', 'tone', 'entire', 'movie', 'previous', 'fire', 'chief', 'was', 'uncle', 'father', 'brother', 'who', 'lost', 'life', 'line', 'duty', 'father', 'arson', 'related', 'series', 'fires', 'have', 'happened', 'audience', 'sees', 'devices', 'made', 'watches', 'cigarette', 'packs', 'clue', 'audience', 'fact', 'father', 'right.Through', 'mechanisms', 'wo', ""n't"", 'reveal', 'Shane', 'up', ""'stray"", 'dog', 'responsibilty', 'father', 'realize', 'basically', 'ignored', 'son', 'son', 'needs', 'brother', 'passed', 'end', 'sweet', 'story', 'line', 'are', 'intense', 'moments', 'especially', 'end', 'when', 'Shane', 'trapped', 'fire', 'set', 'arsonist', 'whom', 'course', 'identified', 'end', 'apprehend', 'course', 'end', 'everyone', 'safe', 'live', 'happily', 'ever', 'personally', 'would', ""n't"", 'recommend', 'however', 'children', 'age', '10', '9', 'youngest.Anne', '[', ']']",Firehouse Dog (Widescreen Edition)

But shortly after that it became a family movie and I was glad I stuck it out. When Rexxx becomes Dewey we see a unusual dog become a great pet and firehouse mascot. That transition changes the lifes of all he touches. Fans of dogs should definitely catch it as it truly shows how dogs are one of man and woman's best friends. I have to say one as I think cats are too.

It will lift your spirits as Dewey (a.k.a Rexx) goes from pampered Hollywood canine to a working firehouse dog, though he retains much of his Hollywood personality. Parts of the film are so funny that I couldn't help but burst-out laughing so hard my neighbors must have wondering what was going-on in my apartment. I felt so much better after seeing this film the first time that I wanted to see it again immediately. Yeah, some of the stunts are silly, but they never take away from the enjoyment of the movie. The scene where Dewey slid down the firepole made me cringe and I could feel the poor guy's pain.There are sad scenes in the film that can melt the stoniest heart, so be ready to cry. Not often, but when the tears come, you won't be able to hold them back. Tender scenes abound in this film, as Connor Fahey and his son Shane begin to repair their relationship, spurred-on by the new dog in their lives. The love between father and son, the close friendship of the firefighters at Engine 55 and everyone falling for Dewey makes the film glow with the love of the main characters for each other.The subplot reminded me a little of Backdraft which, along with the come-from-behind story of the Engine Company, makes the film suspenseful, inspiring and uplifting all at the same time. I'd advise parents not to have very little children watch the film, but kids of 3rd grade level should be alright watching it. If you collect movie posters, get the poster for Firehouse Dog, too.

655134,A395BI70WRUFY,B00005JPON,D. Ware,"[1, 2]","There is a lot to really like about this movie besides the adorable canine star of the show.The movie itself is a good morality play, albeit a shallow one. It teaches youngsters the typical message about the importance of honesty and how adults and kids can learn from each other. There is a bit of action and suspense, at least enough to keep the kids' attention and adults too, to a certain extent.The main star is, of course, the cute and well trained Irish Terrier, Rexxx. In actuality, several dogs filled the role, but all did very well.The main problem I had with the movie were the needless, outlandish stunts performed by the dog (or rather, the CGI creators).. The opening stunt, a completely unbelievable jump from an jet plane into the back of a tomato truck was completely outlandish and really uneeded for the story set up.

Christenson / Lunamation ""SpaceComics.com""","[4, 5]","Firehouse Dog won't go down as one of the greatest family films in history (likeA Dog of FlandersorA Tree Grows in Brooklyn), but is good solid family entertainment, with the kind of effective blend of comedy, action, and drama found in more successfull action comedies (The Goonies) and comedy dramas (The Courtship of Eddie's Father).Josh Hutcherson, who proved his diverse acting skills starring in films ranging fromLittle ManhattantoBridge to Terabithia, plays 12-year-old Shane, who's father is the Captain of the firehouse housing Fire Engine 55.  We learn through dialog that the Captain is a widower who succeded his own late brother to the job, leaving Shane with very little parental supervision.  While ditching school Shane runs into Rexxx, a lost Hollywood movie dog.  Shane is caught due to the dog jumping on him, and resents the dog for a while.  Rexxx was lost wearing a prop collar so they think his name is Dewey, and can't find the owner; but while trying Shane learns how good Dewey is at tricks and gradually decides he wants to adopt him. So you have a typical dog movie situation, the dogs presence improving the boys character while you wonder if the boy will have to lose the dog if the Hollywood owner ever turns up.But wait there's more:  meanwhile Shane learns his father is investigating a series of fires that might be arson -- including the  one in which his uncle died.  So the plot builds up to a more serious situation with suspense, firefighting action, and a dramatic conclusion.  Fortunately this is developed gradually from the more humorous first half of the movie, so it works on both levels, and never gets too scary for kids, but never gets dull, with some firefighting action for Dads, animal stunts for everyone, humor that's never more crude than a couple dog flatulence jokes, and a moderately poignant story to hold it all together.",5,Effective blend of comedy drama / action comedy / animal fun.,1186185600,"08 4, 2007",2007,1881,"['Firehouse', 'Dog', 'wo', ""n't"", 'go', 'down', 'as', 'one', 'greatest', 'family', 'films', 'history', 'likeA', 'Dog', 'FlandersorA', 'Tree', 'Grows', 'Brooklyn', 'good', 'solid', 'family', 'entertainment', 'kind', 'effective', 'blend', 'comedy', 'action', 'drama', 'found', 'more', 'successfull', 'action', 'comedies', 'Goonies', 'comedy', 'dramas', 'Courtship', 'Eddie', 'Father', '.Josh', 'Hutcherson', 'who', 'proved', 'diverse', 'acting', 'skills', 'starring', 'films', 'ranging', 'fromLittle', 'ManhattantoBridge', 'Terabithia', '12-year-old', 'Shane', 'who', 'father', 'Captain', 'firehouse', 'housing', 'Fire', 'Engine', '55', 'learn', 'dialog', 'Captain', 'widower', 'who', 'succeded', 'own', 'late', 'brother', 'job', 'leaving', 'Shane', 'very', 'little', 'parental', 'supervision', 'ditching', 'school', 'Shane', 'Rexxx', 'lost', 'Hollywood', 'movie', 'dog', 'Shane', 'caught', 'due', 'dog', 'jumping', 'dog', 'while', 'Rexxx', 'was', 'lost', 'wearing', 'prop', 'collar', 'think', 'name', 'Dewey', 'ca', ""n't"", 'find', 'owner', 'trying', 'Shane', 'how', 'good', 'Dewey', 'tricks', 'gradually', 'adopt', 'So', 'have', 'typical', 'dog', 'movie', 'situation', 'dogs', 'presence', 'improving', 'boys', 'character', 'wonder', 'boy', 'will', 'have', 'lose', 'dog', 'Hollywood', 'owner', 'ever', 'up.But', 'more', 'meanwhile', 'Shane', 'father', 'investigating', 'series', 'fires', 'might', 'be', 'arson', 'including', 'one', 'uncle', 'died', 'plot', 'up', 'more', 'serious', 'situation', 'suspense', 'firefighting', 'action', 'dramatic', 'conclusion', 'Fortunately', 'developed', 'gradually', 'more', 'humorous', 'first', 'half', 'movie', 'levels', 'never', 'too', 'scary', 'kids', 'never', 'dull', 'firefighting', 'action', 'Dads', 'animal', 'stunts', 'everyone', 'humor', 'never', 'more', 'crude', 'couple', 'dog', 'flatulence', 'jokes', 'moderately', 'poignant', 'story', 'hold', 'together']",Firehouse Dog (Widescreen Edition)

With his natural talent for search-and-rescue missions, Rexxx soon insinuates his way into the hearts and affections of all, including the young, slightly troubled son (Josh Hutcherson) of the station`s chief (Bruce Greenwood).Despite all its obvious good intentions, I can scarcely imagine anyone but the tiniest tots in the audience being either intrigued or inspired by this film.  Apart from the slight difference that the Timmy-fallen-down-a-well predicament has been replaced by a Shane-trapped-in-a-burning-firehouse sequence, this is a thoroughly conventional ""a boy and his dog"" tale in which neither the boy nor the dog is really all that appealing.  In fact, Rexxx is so un-cute and so un-cuddly that it's hard to believe that he could ever be a true canine superstar sensation in the real world.As for the script, it consists mainly of feeble jokes, broad slapstick and obvious sentimentality ladled out in roughly equal measure.
