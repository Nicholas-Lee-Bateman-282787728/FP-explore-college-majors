1686254,APY99MH9BN3GQ,B00H8N5IQS,Anonymous,"[0, 0]","I lost 4 lbs in one week following both the diet and exercise portion of this DVD. My goal was the 7 lbs she claims to help you lose. However, I pulled an abdominal muscle on day 5 and had to modify the last 2 days. (I'm a moderate exerciser and have never pulled a muscle while working out so it surprised and frustrated me). If you love Jillian, you'll like this to add to your collection. I lost 20 lbs doing her Body Revolution and recommend that for anyone looking to change their lifestyle and lose significant weight!",4,Another JM DVD to add the collection,1405987200,"07 22, 2014",2014,524,"['lost', '4', 'lbs', 'one', 'week', 'following', 'diet', 'exercise', 'portion', 'DVD', 'goal', 'was', '7', 'lbs', 'help', 'lose', 'However', 'pulled', 'abdominal', 'muscle', 'day', '5', 'had', 'modify', 'last', '2', 'days', ""'m"", 'moderate', 'exerciser', 'have', 'never', 'pulled', 'muscle', 'working', 'out', 'surprised', 'frustrated', 'love', 'Jillian', ""'ll"", 'like', 'add', 'collection', 'lost', '20', 'lbs', 'doing', 'Body', 'Revolution', 'recommend', 'anyone', 'looking', 'change', 'lifestyle', 'lose', 'significant', 'weight']",Jillian Michaels One Week Shred
1686255,A3JR4ZUHGBY8T4,B00H8N5IQS,Beck_Ives,"[1, 1]","I bought this thinking that I would just do the workouts without the diet. I looked at the diet, but it is shockingly low on carbs (there are a few, but not many). That would contribute to a significant amount of weight loss without the workout. In fact, as a seasoned South Beach dieter, there is a 2 week phase that is carb free, I have (in the past) lost 7 pounds in a week eating like that WITHOUT exercising. When I don't eat carbs, I'm dragging. DRAGGING. I can't conceive of doing this workout program for a week on that diet. Here's the rub- this workout is INTENSE. You might have suspected Jillian was trying to kill you in her other videos. She really is. This workout program convinced me of that. :-)So I didn't get shredded. I didn't even get slightly slimmer. I got tired. And the thing is, I really like the workouts. They are good and I think they really would do exactly as they were designed if I followed all the rules of the diet.Friendly tip: I fast forward to about 1:49 on the AM workout because I can't stand her awkward introduction to the dude that is in the video. Really? &#34;Something pretty to look at.&#34; Ugh.The AM workout is the strength training portion, and it is so weird to see a muscle-y dude using 3 lb weights. But the workout is decent and most of it is pretty intense. Three pound weights for most people is probably okay. I find the first circuit is mostly okay with 5 lb weights though. It works the back.The rest of the circuits that use weights I use 3's, although the last move, the cauldron crunches, I used 8's.PM- This workout is 100% cardio. If you're following the diet, I recommend eating a small snack about 30 minutes before this workout, because you will DIE. She launches into cardio immediately.The most valuable part of this DVD for me is that I finally have a 30 minute pure cardio workout to use after an intensive weight training session. Jillian usually does workouts that combine strength and cardio, so that is usually not easy to come by in my Jillian library.  I love her Kickbox Fast Fix, but they are only 20 minutes beginning to end, so often I have to rewind a bit to repeat a circuit or two to get to 30 minutes.Okay, so bottom line: these are both awesome workouts. I think for one week, it's doable, although I have not yet done it for a week with the diet as well.I don't think that I could stick to this longer than a week at a time because it is soooooo exhausting. Plus, I don't like working out twice a day.  It is important to remember that this dvd is only intended to be a one week program that is used just occasionally.As for my lack of results, I blame myself. I know Jillian hasn't let me down. This program is good- the workouts are insane, the diet will be effective. Next time I try this, I will follow both the diet and exercise plan. But it might be March or April before I feel that motivation again. :-)",4,Maybe if I followed the diet plan too,1402617600,"06 13, 2014",2014,2900,"['bought', 'thinking', 'would', 'just', 'do', 'workouts', 'diet', 'looked', 'diet', 'shockingly', 'low', 'carbs', 'are', 'few', 'not', 'many', 'would', 'contribute', 'significant', 'amount', 'weight', 'loss', 'workout', 'fact', 'seasoned', 'South', 'Beach', 'dieter', '2', 'week', 'phase', 'carb', 'free', 'have', 'past', 'lost', '7', 'pounds', 'week', 'eating', 'WITHOUT', 'exercising', 'When', 'do', ""n't"", 'eat', 'carbs', ""'m"", 'dragging', 'DRAGGING', 'ca', ""n't"", 'conceive', 'doing', 'workout', 'program', 'week', 'diet', 'Here', 'rub-', 'workout', 'INTENSE', 'might', 'have', 'suspected', 'Jillian', 'was', 'trying', 'kill', 'other', 'videos', 'really', 'workout', 'program', 'convinced', 'did', ""n't"", 'get', 'shredded', 'did', ""n't"", 'even', 'get', 'slightly', 'slimmer', 'got', 'tired', 'thing', 'really', 'workouts', 'are', 'good', 'think', 'really', 'would', 'do', 'exactly', 'were', 'designed', 'followed', 'rules', 'diet.Friendly', 'tip', 'fast', 'forward', '1:49', 'AM', 'workout', 'ca', ""n't"", 'stand', 'awkward', 'introduction', 'dude', 'video', 'Really', '34', 'Something', 'pretty', 'look', 'at.', '34', 'Ugh.The', 'AM', 'workout', 'strength', 'training', 'portion', 'so', 'weird', 'see', 'muscle-y', 'dude', 'using', '3', 'lb', 'weights', 'workout', 'decent', 'most', 'pretty', 'intense', 'Three', 'pound', 'weights', 'most', 'people', 'probably', 'okay', 'find', 'first', 'circuit', 'mostly', 'okay', '5', 'lb', 'weights', 'back.The', 'rest', 'circuits', 'use', 'weights', 'use', '3', 'last', 'move', 'cauldron', 'crunches', 'used', ""8's.PM-"", 'workout', '100', '%', 'cardio', ""'re"", 'following', 'diet', 'recommend', 'eating', 'small', 'snack', '30', 'minutes', 'workout', 'will', 'DIE', 'cardio', 'immediately.The', 'most', 'valuable', 'part', 'DVD', 'finally', 'have', '30', 'minute', 'pure', 'cardio', 'workout', 'use', 'intensive', 'weight', 'training', 'session', 'Jillian', 'usually', 'workouts', 'combine', 'strength', 'cardio', 'usually', 'not', 'easy', 'come', 'Jillian', 'library', 'love', 'Kickbox', 'Fast', 'Fix', 'are', 'only', '20', 'minutes', 'beginning', 'end', 'so', 'often', 'have', 'rewind', 'bit', 'repeat', 'circuit', 'two', 'get', '30', 'minutes.Okay', 'so', 'bottom', 'line', 'are', 'awesome', 'workouts', 'think', 'one', 'week', 'doable', 'have', 'not', 'yet', 'done', 'week', 'diet', 'well.I', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'could', 'stick', 'longer', 'week', 'time', 'soooooo', 'exhausting', 'do', ""n't"", 'like', 'working', 'out', 'twice', 'day', 'important', 'remember', 'dvd', 'only', 'intended', 'be', 'one', 'week', 'program', 'used', 'just', 'occasionally.As', 'lack', 'results', 'blame', 'know', 'Jillian', ""n't"", 'let', 'down', 'program', 'good-', 'workouts', 'are', 'insane', 'diet', 'will', 'be', 'effective', 'Next', 'time', 'try', 'will', 'follow', 'diet', 'exercise', 'plan', 'might', 'be', 'March', 'April', 'feel', 'motivation', 'again']",Jillian Michaels One Week Shred

If you like Jillian's Banish Fat Boost Metabolism (BFBM) & No More Trouble Zones (NMTZ), then you will LOVE this DVD!!  I love both BFBM & NMTZ, but the problem is, I don't always have a full hour to work out.  Therefore, this DVD is perfect because here you have one 30 minute INTENSE cardio segment, and another 30 minute pure strength training segment.  The workouts are easy to follow and will make you sweat and BURN calories.At this time, I have no intentions of following the one week shred program; I do however, plan on alternating days between the strength and cardio workouts. This DVD is versatile.  Even if you only work out once a day, 6 x a week alternating between cardio & strength days, I am positive you will see results!If you plan on following the One Week program (AM & PM workout along with diet plan), I am sure it will work!

1686267,AG03DQLMV2EHV,B00H8N5IQS,Love to be FIt,"[77, 90]","When it comes to DVDs and workouts, there is a lot of personal preference. I am a certified fitness instructor and I prefer high-rep interval workouts like Jari Love and Angie Gorr. I just feel the burn more with high-reps. However, I realize that it is good to mix it up. Each instructor has their own style, and Jillian is great at what she does. I don't agree with the marketing of losing 7 lbs in 7 days, as I don't feel it is safe to lose more than 2lbs per week, but it is really marketed as a crash one-week shred. I actually think it is a great workout.  I like to do the DVD all at once because I don't have time to work on in both the morning and the evening, but from the research I've studied, the old research thought that cardio was better in the morning and weights at night, but the research is now showing that if you are going to do a split, weights are better in the morning and cardio at night, and that our cardio abilities peak between 5 and 7 PM.  If I am going to mix it up, it is easier for me to do weights in the morning because I don't have enough energy to be bouncing around that early in the morning. However, I typically only have time to do it all at once, so you can actually use the DVD in multiple ways. You can do 1 hour cardio followed by weights, or do weights followed by cardio or split it up. I  REALLY loved the cardio portion, so for cardio days this will be a great 30 min workout to do.I would say this DVD is a blend between her Burn Fat Boost Metabolism and Hard-Body The weight portion combines weights and body resistance. I personally don't like body resistant moves, but I know they are good for me, so I do them. I am very advanced and had to use 8lb weights, but could probably even go higher next time. I really prefer high-reps for weights as opposed to switching it up every 30 seconds, but this is just Jillian's style and it is good to mix it up. The weight portion did have some unique moves, and you can always modify. I did prefer the cardio to the weight section. I like Jackie Warner&#8217;s time saver training 30 min weight section where you do each exercises for 1 min, so I would prefer the weights to be done a little longer; however, the weight section was good and there were some unique moves that work different muscles. Each weight circuit has about 6 -8 exercises each done for 30 seconds and then you do it again and move on to the next circuit.The Cardio section was great and I love this athletic style of cardio. I agree with others that the cardio moves aren't unique, but they don't have to be, it is all about the flow of the moves, getting your heart rate up and getting results, and these athletic style moves are great, and you only do them for 30 seconds, so time flies by!I like Jillian in this video. I think she talks just the right amount, motivates and encourages you. She also does a good job explaining the form and encourages modifications if you need it. Some of the moves are hard, so modification is easy. There is one move where you twist and kick your leg out and this can be hard for anyone with back pain. I just did jumping jacks during this portion and I kept my heart rate up.It is a more advanced workout (the cardio is similar to insanity, but maybe not as intense, but it can be depending on how hard you work). However, for beginners you can always march it out if it gets too tough.Some people mentioned the lights and the studio, and I agree but it really didn't bother me. Is this a good workout, YES! Will this burn a ton of calories, YES! Does Jillian motivate you, YES! Are there modifications, YES! Does she explain good form, YES!Therefore, the workout is good. Someone also mentioned they prefer 30 day shred to get a total body workout all at once. I like the 3-2-1 format of 30 day shred (and ripped in 30 which is a little harder). However, this DVD is just a different program, and it is great to switch it up. I've done over 200 DVDs and I would say this is one of my favorite of Jillian&#8217;s. Here is a list of my favorites: 30 day shred, ripped in 30, Burn Fat Boost metabolism and the One week Shred.Also, I really liked her hair color in this video&#8230;whoever did her hair did a really good job!",5,This is one of her best!,1394841600,"03 15, 2014",2014,4227,"['When', 'DVDs', 'workouts', 'lot', 'personal', 'preference', 'am', 'certified', 'fitness', 'instructor', 'prefer', 'high-rep', 'interval', 'workouts', 'Jari', 'Love', 'Angie', 'Gorr', 'just', 'feel', 'burn', 'more', 'high-reps', 'However', 'realize', 'good', 'mix', 'up', 'instructor', 'own', 'style', 'Jillian', 'great', 'what', 'do', ""n't"", 'agree', 'marketing', 'losing', '7', 'lbs', '7', 'days', 'do', ""n't"", 'feel', 'safe', 'lose', 'more', '2lbs', 'week', 'really', 'marketed', 'crash', 'one-week', 'shred', 'actually', 'think', 'great', 'workout', 'like', 'do', 'DVD', 'once', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'time', 'work', 'morning', 'evening', 'research', ""'ve"", 'studied', 'old', 'research', 'thought', 'cardio', 'was', 'better', 'morning', 'weights', 'night', 'research', 'now', 'showing', 'are', 'going', 'do', 'split', 'weights', 'are', 'better', 'morning', 'cardio', 'night', 'cardio', 'peak', '5', '7', 'PM', 'am', 'going', 'mix', 'up', 'easier', 'do', 'weights', 'morning', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'enough', 'energy', 'be', 'bouncing', 'early', 'morning', 'However', 'typically', 'only', 'have', 'time', 'do', 'once', 'can', 'actually', 'use', 'DVD', 'multiple', 'ways', 'can', 'do', '1', 'hour', 'cardio', 'followed', 'weights', 'do', 'weights', 'followed', 'cardio', 'split', 'REALLY', 'loved', 'cardio', 'portion', 'so', 'cardio', 'days', 'will', 'be', 'great', '30', 'min', 'workout', 'do.I', 'would', 'say', 'DVD', 'blend', 'Burn', 'Fat', 'Boost', 'Metabolism', 'Hard-Body', 'weight', 'portion', 'combines', 'weights', 'body', 'resistance', 'personally', 'do', ""n't"", 'like', 'body', 'resistant', 'moves', 'know', 'are', 'good', 'so', 'do', 'am', 'very', 'advanced', 'had', 'use', '8lb', 'weights', 'could', 'probably', 'even', 'go', 'higher', 'next', 'time', 'really', 'prefer', 'high-reps', 'weights', 'opposed', 'switching', '30', 'seconds', 'just', 'Jillian', 'style', 'good', 'mix', 'up', 'weight', 'portion', 'did', 'have', 'unique', 'moves', 'can', 'always', 'modify', 'did', 'prefer', 'cardio', 'weight', 'section', 'like', 'Jackie', 'Warner', '8217', 's', 'time', 'saver', 'training', '30', 'min', 'weight', 'section', 'where', 'do', 'exercises', '1', 'min', 'would', 'prefer', 'weights', 'be', 'done', 'little', 'longer', 'however', 'weight', 'section', 'was', 'good', 'were', 'unique', 'moves', 'work', 'different', 'muscles', 'weight', 'circuit', 'about', '6', '-8', 'exercises', 'done', '30', 'seconds', 'then', 'do', 'again', 'move', 'next', 'circuit.The', 'Cardio', 'section', 'was', 'great', 'love', 'athletic', 'style', 'cardio', 'agree', 'others', 'cardio', 'moves', 'are', ""n't"", 'unique', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'be', 'flow', 'moves', 'getting', 'heart', 'rate', 'getting', 'results', 'athletic', 'style', 'moves', 'are', 'great', 'only', 'do', '30', 'seconds', 'time', 'flies', 'like', 'Jillian', 'video', 'think', 'just', 'right', 'amount', 'motivates', 'encourages', 'also', 'good', 'job', 'explaining', 'form', 'encourages', 'modifications', 'need', 'moves', 'are', 'hard', 'modification', 'easy', 'one', 'move', 'where', 'twist', 'kick', 'leg', 'out', 'can', 'be', 'hard', 'anyone', 'back', 'pain', 'just', 'did', 'jumping', 'jacks', 'portion', 'kept', 'heart', 'rate', 'up.It', 'more', 'advanced', 'workout', 'cardio', 'similar', 'insanity', 'maybe', 'not', 'intense', 'can', 'be', 'depending', 'how', 'hard', 'work', 'However', 'beginners', 'can', 'always', 'march', 'out', 'too', 'tough.Some', 'people', 'mentioned', 'lights', 'studio', 'agree', 'really', 'did', ""n't"", 'bother', 'good', 'workout', 'YES', 'Will', 'burn', 'ton', 'calories', 'YES', 'Does', 'Jillian', 'motivate', 'YES', 'Are', 'there', 'modifications', 'YES', 'explain', 'good', 'form', 'YES', 'Therefore', 'workout', 'good', 'Someone', 'also', 'mentioned', 'prefer', '30', 'day', 'shred', 'get', 'total', 'body', 'once', '3-2-1', 'format', '30', 'day', 'shred', 'ripped', '30', 'little', 'harder', 'However', 'DVD', 'just', 'different', 'program', 'great', 'switch', 'up', ""'ve"", 'done', '200', 'DVDs', 'would', 'say', 'one', 'favorite', 'Jillian', '8217', 's.', 'Here', 'list', 'favorites', '30', 'day', 'shred', 'ripped', '30', 'Burn', 'Fat', 'Boost', 'metabolism', 'One', 'week', 'Shred.Also', 'really', 'liked', 'hair', 'color', 'video', '8230', 'did', 'hair', 'did', 'really', 'good', 'job']",Jillian Michaels One Week Shred

When she leans down to the camera her face gets lit by lights underneath which is unflattering and dramatically inappropriate for this kind of video.
