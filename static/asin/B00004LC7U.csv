It was discovered years later, and Rand thought it was very well done. So together with associates, she edited the film and released it. It stands today as a wonderful representation of her work. Set in Russia, it philosophically presents her ideas about the fatal blow to human nature that Communism represents. It is a dramatic story of Kira, who yearns for freedom, her lover Leo, who becomes ill with TB and needs money for institutionalized care, and the Communist leader who Kira pretends to love in order to get the money for Leo's cure. This love triangle is the center of the story, and the dialogue and integrity of each character is displayed in a way that touches the heart of anyone interested in the argument of Capitalism vs Communism.

As one character lectures another herein: ""why do you think you are entitled to your own thoughts...against those of the majority of the Collective?""  After all, as a Bolshevik explains, ""...no external enemy...is as dangerous to us as the internal enemy of dissension within our own ranks.  On the jacket of the book on which this film is based appears the following: ""We the Living demonstrates the supreme value of a human life and the evil of those who claim the right to sacrifice it.""  There's your life.  You begin it feeling that it's something so precious & rare, so beautiful that it's like a sacred treasure.""  But ""one man means nothing in the face of the mighty Proletarian Collective,"" the Bolsheviks counter.  In such an environment, Kira, the heroine of this film (based on a 1936 novel by Ayn Rand) subsequently concludes: ""Nothing matters. We mustn't think. We mustn't think at all.""  To a Bolshevik she charges, ""you came and forbade life [as in freedom of choice] to the living."" ""You took their every hour, every minute, every nerve, every thought in the farthest corners of their souls---and you told them what it had to be;"" ""telling men ""what they must live for.""  This after we see how a number of characters lose their jobs, or get thrown out of university ""for trying to think"" for themselves.  This is life in the Soviet Union as personally experienced by Ayn Rand (a nom de plume the Russian author invented to protect family members still living in Leningrad at the time). She saw firsthand how Bolshevism went about putting down new rules, fashioning a state that took ""your honor, your life and your freedom."" And while this isn't Ms. Rand's life story, it is, as the author states in the introduction of her novel, a sort of autobiography, in the intellectual sense; having instilled Kira with the author's ""ideas, her convictions, her values."" And while the ""plot is invented,"" Ms. Rand admits, ""the background is not.""  And the ""Sovietness"" of said background is not the paramount issue herein either, but the notion that, notwithstanding any utopian rhetoric, ""you cannot enslave man's mind.  ""You can only destroy it.""  In a collectivist society, ""what are your masses but millions of dull, shrivelled, stagnant souls that have no thoughts of their own, no dreams of their own, no will of their own.""  This film based (faithfully for the most part) on Ms. Rand's work is, in short, a powerfully written expose of collectivist mentalities; a warning that ""you cannot castigate life ""in order to perpetuate it."" Do make an effort to see it.  It's a very effective film. (06May) Cheers!",4,"One of the few film versions of Ayn Rand's maxim that ""You cannot enslave man's mind.

For those who don't know, this is an unauthorized version of Ayn Rand's novel We The Living.  It was made in 1942 under Mussolini's rule.  It had the full approval of the government, at least when it was being made.  When the film was shown to the censor boards, it was banned.  But somehow Mussolini saw it himself, and he loved it, so it was approved and was shown around Italy.  But then Mussolini reversed himself, because the film was as much anti-authoritarian as it was anti-Communist.  It disappeared for decades, but eventually it was rediscovered, and even Ayn Rand loved the film (and she wasn't easy to please).The film is remarkable in that it makes Rand's characters believable and they come across as real people.  Rand's characters in her novel usually pontificate on soapboxes about the ideal of capitalism, the evil of collectivism, etc., etc..  There is a little of that here, and it's pretty muted compared to the later film version of The Fountainhead.  It also gives hope that Rand's novels (there aren't many of them) can actually be made into good movies.  The Fountainhead is a particularly bad film, and Atlas Shrugged hasn't seen the light of day for nearly 50 years (and is still in the dark hell of development).

547603,A3SX8SK5TFOULX,B00004LC7U,R. Williams,"[3, 4]","Full disclosure...I am a big Ayn Rand fan.  I had read We the Living and was curious about a film adaptation of the book.  This movie is long and in Italian with English subtitles, so I had some uncertainty about purchasing it.  At first I had some trouble getting established with the story, trying to watch the action while reading the subtitles, but after awhile, the movie just draws you in and you are fully engaged with the characters.  This movie is 174 minutes long.  Quite long by today's movie standards, but well worth the time spent watching.  PLUS, there is a bonus disc in the box that contains a wonderful extra video: ""We the Living, A Lost Treasure Recovered"" that details how the film was hidden away from Mussolini.  Mussolini had originally authorized this unauthorized version of the film (Ayn Rand had not authorized it) during the war to show how bad Communism was, but ironically, the people viewing it realized they had it just as bad under Fascism. Mussolini then banned the movie and tried to destroy all copies.  The original negatives were hidden away and Mussolini ended up destroying the negatives of another movie. The bonus video goes on to explain how the book had been made into two movies with lots of Mussolini propaganda and how they cut out the propaganda and put the film back together again as one movie that followed the main plot of the book.  I found it quite interesting.My puny review does not do this movie justice.  I highly recommend it for Ayn Rand fans and future Ayn Rand fans.

547604,APRZ2IVM8JTLV,B00004LC7U,The Mysterious Traveler,"[8, 9]","WE THE LIVING (1942) Directed by Goffredo Alessandrini. Based on the novel by Ayn Rand.Starring Alida Valli, Raf Vallone and Rossano Brazzi.Based on the heavily autobiographical novel by Rand, a love triangle between an anti-communist girl, an aristocrat and a member of the GRU...an interim name for the Soviet secret police after CHEKA but before KGB..... set during the 1922-24 period in Petrograd.  A strange film since it is an Italian movie set in Russia and based on a novel in english.  The basis for a good number of I suspect anti-communist romances with echoes and plotpoints that will later appear in everything from DR ZHIVAGO to ENEMY AT THE GATES.  A good film. Good history. A tad overly romantic at times considering the hellhole the characters must exist in and with a moderately happier ending than the book.  Great set design.  The film was banned in Communist Russia, Nazi Germany and Fascist Italy and was lost until 1986.",5,DR ZHIVAGO WITHOUT THE RAINBOW,1271030400,"04 12, 2010",2010,944,"['THE', 'LIVING', '1942', 'Directed', 'Goffredo', 'Alessandrini', 'Based', 'novel', 'Ayn', 'Rand.Starring', 'Alida', 'Valli', 'Raf', 'Vallone', 'Rossano', 'Brazzi.Based', 'heavily', 'autobiographical', 'novel', 'Rand', 'love', 'triangle', 'anti-communist', 'girl', 'aristocrat', 'member', 'GRU', 'interim', 'name', 'Soviet', 'secret', 'police', 'CHEKA', 'KGB', '..', 'set', '1922-24', 'period', 'Petrograd', 'A', 'strange', 'film', 'Italian', 'movie', 'set', 'Russia', 'based', 'novel', 'english', 'basis', 'good', 'number', 'suspect', 'anti-communist', 'romances', 'echoes', 'plotpoints', 'will', 'later', 'appear', 'everything', 'DR', 'ZHIVAGO', 'ENEMY', 'AT', 'THE', 'GATES', 'good', 'film', 'Good', 'history', 'tad', 'overly', 'romantic', 'times', 'considering', 'hellhole', 'characters', 'must', 'exist', 'moderately', 'happier', 'ending', 'book', 'Great', 'set', 'design', 'film', 'was', 'banned', 'Communist', 'Russia', 'Nazi', 'Germany', 'Fascist', 'Italy', 'was', 'lost', '1986']",Ayn Rand - WE THE LIVING VHS
547605,A2ZRC8P3MBIQL3,B00004LC7U,"TUCO H. ""H. TUCO""","[12, 43]","This movie is an underrated charmer &amp; a hell of a lot more interesting than the mediocre novel it was based on (Rand was much better at writing razor-sharp, non-fiction essays). No one can do melodrama as well as the Italians of the pre-neo-realist period, with their operatic traditions and passionate sounding language colliding with the harsh realities of the war period and Mussollini fascism.Here Italians get to play some unrealistic Russians, but they do it with so much conviction and passion, you don't care one bit! The message of Rand's anti-tyranny novel comes across beautifully through the cumulative force of the situations, the dramatic dialogue, and the elegant dramatic gestures used by Alida Valli, Rossano Brazzi, Fosco Grachietti and the rest of the superb cast, in showing you realistic internalizations of the many conflicts raging in people as a result of those historically based situations. The Italian actors of this period maintain a charming balance between utter naturalism and passionate going 'over-the-topisms'. The camera movements, style, and mythic distance of the film are also very impressive, not afraid to use the dreamy aspects of the cinematic illusion to full effect. As a further bonus, Renzo Rossellini's super-busy but always understated music adds that touch of surrealism &amp; romantic existentialism that he would become famous for later in Roberto Rossellini's masterworks.One of the reasons it probably works as well as it does is because it was made right on the brink of the neo-realist revolution without the knowledge of Rand herself, who might have unwittingly stifled its more poetic and crazy aspects in favor of more 'philosophy' had she been involved. She loved it later, some forty years later, when she discovered a print (Mussolini's government had confiscated all prints and the negative), which shows her good judgment after the fact, and that, some remanants of a true artist and a philosopher were still left in her, even when the Objectivist movement itself had turned into a cult.",1,On the Brink of Neo-Realism &amp; Onward to Douglas Sirkisms,1003104000,"10 15, 2001",2001,2054,"['movie', 'underrated', 'charmer', 'amp', 'hell', 'lot', 'more', 'interesting', 'mediocre', 'novel', 'was', 'based', 'Rand', 'was', 'much', 'better', 'writing', 'razor-sharp', 'non-fiction', 'essays', 'one', 'can', 'do', 'melodrama', 'as', 'well', 'Italians', 'pre-neo-realist', 'period', 'operatic', 'traditions', 'passionate', 'sounding', 'language', 'colliding', 'harsh', 'realities', 'war', 'period', 'Mussollini', 'fascism.Here', 'get', 'play', 'unrealistic', 'Russians', 'do', 'so', 'much', 'conviction', 'passion', 'do', ""n't"", 'care', 'one', 'bit', 'message', 'Rand', 'anti-tyranny', 'novel', 'beautifully', 'cumulative', 'force', 'situations', 'dramatic', 'dialogue', 'elegant', 'dramatic', 'gestures', 'used', 'Alida', 'Valli', 'Rossano', 'Brazzi', 'Fosco', 'Grachietti', 'rest', 'superb', 'cast', 'showing', 'realistic', 'internalizations', 'many', 'conflicts', 'raging', 'people', 'result', 'historically', 'based', 'situations', 'Italian', 'actors', 'period', 'maintain', 'charming', 'balance', 'utter', 'naturalism', 'passionate', 'going', ""'over-the-topisms"", 'camera', 'movements', 'style', 'mythic', 'distance', 'film', 'are', 'also', 'very', 'impressive', 'not', 'afraid', 'use', 'dreamy', 'aspects', 'cinematic', 'illusion', 'full', 'effect', 'further', 'bonus', 'Renzo', 'Rossellini', 'super-busy', 'always', 'understated', 'music', 'touch', 'surrealism', 'amp', 'romantic', 'existentialism', 'would', 'become', 'famous', 'later', 'Roberto', 'Rossellini', 'masterworks.One', 'reasons', 'probably', 'as', 'well', 'was', 'made', 'right', 'brink', 'neo-realist', 'revolution', 'knowledge', 'Rand', 'who', 'might', 'have', 'unwittingly', 'stifled', 'more', 'poetic', 'crazy', 'aspects', 'favor', 'more', ""'philosophy"", 'had', 'been', 'involved', 'loved', 'later', 'forty', 'years', 'later', 'when', 'discovered', 'print', 'Mussolini', 'government', 'had', 'confiscated', 'prints', 'negative', 'good', 'judgment', 'fact', 'remanants', 'true', 'artist', 'philosopher', 'were', 'still', 'left', 'even', 'when', 'Objectivist', 'movement', 'had', 'turned', 'cult']",Ayn Rand - WE THE LIVING VHS

Filmed and originally released in fascist Italy during WWII, it was eventually ordered destroyed by Mussolini...but cooler minds (those of the producers) prevailed and secreted a copy. It took four decades for this movie to get ""unveiled"" again.2) It stars Valli, who would 8-9 years later go on to star with Joseph Cotton and Orson Welles in the classic ""The Third Man."" She's beautiful and phenomenal!3) Until now, this movie was only available on VHS and the old laser discs. I bought it on laser disc back in the early 1990s, and have been waiting for a DVD release for years. And it's been worth the wait!The extras are cool...all new. A 35-minute documentary on the movie, its post-war discovery, and its re-release. Then about 45 minutes of deleted scenes, all of which were cut out during preparation for the film's revival in the 1980s and made under Ayn Rand's supervision. It's very nice to see these.A ""must own"" for Ayn Rand fans, lovers of liberty, and lovers of great film!",5,FINALLY available on DVD,1254355200,"10 1, 2009",2009,1050,"['few', 'things', '1', 'lost', 'classic', 'must', 'be', 'seen', 'Filmed', 'originally', 'released', 'fascist', 'Italy', 'WWII', 'was', 'eventually', 'ordered', 'destroyed', 'Mussolini', 'cooler', 'minds', 'producers', 'prevailed', 'secreted', 'copy', 'took', 'four', 'decades', 'movie', 'get', 'unveiled', 'again.2', 'Valli', 'who', 'would', '8-9', 'years', 'later', 'go', 'star', 'Joseph', 'Cotton', 'Orson', 'Welles', 'classic', 'Third', 'Man', 'beautiful', 'phenomenal', '3', 'now', 'movie', 'was', 'only', 'available', 'VHS', 'old', 'laser', 'discs', 'bought', 'laser', 'disc', 'back', 'early', '1990s', 'have', 'been', 'waiting', 'DVD', 'release', 'years', 'been', 'wait', 'extras', 'are', 'cool', 'new', '35-minute', 'documentary', 'movie', 'post-war', 'discovery', 're-release', 'Then', '45', 'minutes', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'were', 'cut', 'out', 'preparation', 'film', 'revival', '1980s', 'made', 'Ayn', 'Rand', 'supervision', 'very', 'nice', 'see', 'these.A', 'must', 'own', 'Ayn', 'Rand', 'fans', 'lovers', 'liberty', 'lovers', 'great', 'film']",Ayn Rand - WE THE LIVING VHS
