1268019,A3IO2DBHSOA7S4,B002GSXKNS,Kathleen,"[0, 3]",Bruce Willis at his best. The man is a good actor too bad he is not so nice in his personal life. And we have to be a party to it because he refuses to train himself to disgression. He had the most beautiful woman in the world and trew her away for a peace of tail. Now is doing the same with the second wife. Who seems to be hanging on until she can get a great settlement. And yes Bruce that is how the public sees you as an idiot who can not and will not curb his animal instints. Men who act as you do and let it out in public think they are sexy. but in reality we all know it is because you know in your heart that you are inferior but keep trying to put on a front to prove elsewise .,5,Williss usual,1381017600,"10 6, 2013",2013,691,"['Bruce', 'Willis', 'best', 'man', 'good', 'actor', 'too', 'bad', 'not', 'so', 'nice', 'personal', 'life', 'have', 'be', 'party', 'train', 'disgression', 'had', 'most', 'beautiful', 'woman', 'world', 'trew', 'away', 'peace', 'tail', 'Now', 'doing', 'same', 'second', 'wife', 'Who', 'be', 'hanging', 'can', 'get', 'great', 'settlement', 'yes', 'Bruce', 'how', 'public', 'idiot', 'who', 'can', 'not', 'will', 'not', 'curb', 'animal', 'instints', 'Men', 'who', 'act', 'do', 'let', 'out', 'public', 'think', 'are', 'sexy', 'reality', 'know', 'know', 'heart', 'are', 'inferior', 'keep', 'trying', 'put', 'front', 'prove', 'elsewise']",Bruce Willis - 4 Film Favorites: (16 Blocks / The Last Boy Scout / Last Man Standing / The Whole Nine Yards)

1268024,AOPQ0KA1B7BFD,B002GSXKNS,Ray Gray,"[2, 2]","With a few exceptions, Bruce Willis movies usually involve guns, unemotional steely confidence, and a need to think fast to escape seemingly impossible situations.  The lineup in this collection is no different, but it is a nice collection of variations on the theme, ranging from a favorite comedy (The Whole Nine Yards) to a sepia toned Prohibition period piece (Last Man Standing).The video transfer of the four films varies.  The Whole Nine Yards, with a HDTV screen filling 1.85:1 aspect ratio, is the best image and sound transfer of the bunch.  It is almost Blu-ray perfect.  The other three films are 2.35:1 widescreen aspect ratios.  The image and sound transfer of The Last Boy Scout is the worst of the bunch, rated subjectively as marginal.  It is still watchable though.  Last Man Standing and 16 Blocks I rate as sharp digital with solid sound.  All the movies are 5.1 Dolby but The Last Boy Scout almost comes across as monotone for some reason.The keepcase container has two double sided discs with itty bitty teeny weeny writing around the center hole.  Unless you have superhero eyes you might need a bright light and/or a magnifying glass to choose which movie to watch.If interested in the quad pack put it in your save-for-later purchase bin and keep an eye out for a price drop.
