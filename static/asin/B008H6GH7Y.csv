1553099,A1KVI1PGYSQN63,B008H6GH7Y,"Jim Hawkins ""toaddawet""","[5, 28]","These new 4-DVD sets Disney is releasing are interesting, but I don't know about this one. The Haunted Mansion was a huge disappointment, which could have been amazing (released shortly after the first Pirates of the Caribbean movie, which is the only really well-made one of the four). Tower of Terror--wasn't that a TV-only, B-movie? I don't recognize the Mr. Toad's Wild Ride movie, and didn't Country Bears flop too? Your money is probably better spent on the Ichabod and Mr. Toad DVD--The Adventures of Ichabod and Mr. Toad (Disney Gold Classic Collection)a set of two classic 50's era Disney cartoons that have been all-but forgotten by the company. The Legend of Sleepy Hollow cartoon is a wonderful take on the classic American story, narrated and sung by none other than Bing Crosby! It's perfect Disney fare for spooky family fun. The Mr. Toad cartoon is fun as well--classic animation, some famous voices, and a story any kid would enjoy. Do be warned, the weasel villains use some knives and guns, and even smoke cigars--so parents should decide whether they're comfortable with that prior to letting children watch. Still, The Legend of Sleepy Hollow will give more real 'Thrills & Chills' than this set.",1,Hmmmm....,1353283200,"11 19, 2012",2012,1217,"['new', '4-DVD', 'sets', 'Disney', 'releasing', 'are', 'interesting', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'one', 'Haunted', 'Mansion', 'was', 'huge', 'disappointment', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'amazing', 'released', 'shortly', 'first', 'Pirates', 'Caribbean', 'movie', 'only', 'really', 'well-made', 'one', 'four', 'Tower', 'Terror', 'was', ""n't"", 'TV-only', 'B-movie', 'do', ""n't"", 'recognize', 'Mr.', 'Toad', 'Wild', 'Ride', 'movie', 'did', ""n't"", 'Country', 'Bears', 'flop', 'too', 'money', 'probably', 'better', 'spent', 'Ichabod', 'Mr.', 'Toad', 'DVD', 'Adventures', 'Ichabod', 'Mr.', 'Toad', 'Disney', 'Gold', 'Classic', 'Collection', 'set', 'two', 'classic', '50', 'era', 'Disney', 'cartoons', 'have', 'been', 'all-but', 'forgotten', 'company', 'Legend', 'Sleepy', 'Hollow', 'cartoon', 'wonderful', 'take', 'classic', 'American', 'story', 'narrated', 'sung', 'none', 'other', 'Bing', 'Crosby', 'perfect', 'Disney', 'fare', 'spooky', 'family', 'fun', 'Mr.', 'Toad', 'cartoon', 'fun', 'as', 'well', 'classic', 'animation', 'famous', 'voices', 'story', 'kid', 'would', 'enjoy', 'Do', 'be', 'warned', 'weasel', 'villains', 'use', 'knives', 'guns', 'even', 'smoke', 'cigars', 'parents', 'should', 'decide', ""'re"", 'comfortable', 'prior', 'letting', 'children', 'watch', 'Still', 'Legend', 'Sleepy', 'Hollow', 'will', 'give', 'more', 'real', ""'Thrills"", 'Chills', 'set']","Disney 4-Movie Collection: Thrills and Chills (Haunted Mansion, Tower Of Terror, Mr. Toad's Wild Ride, Country Bears)"
