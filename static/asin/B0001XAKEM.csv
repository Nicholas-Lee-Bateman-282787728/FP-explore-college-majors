It's two discs, features extra footage plus newly recorded interviews with the HGs.  David and Amanda do the nasty, Nathan saves Allison then gets betrayed, Robert calls the girls names, salad bikinis...all the highlights are on this DVD.

815955,A38RYZ7TQ9G8ER,B0001XAKEM,MJSLawrence,"[0, 0]",I wish Create Space would start releasing seasons from this series as they have Survivor and Amazing Race.  Why they only ever released one full season that is next to impossible to find now (season 3) is a mystery and I would buy them all as I have those other series if they released them.As advertised this unfortunately is just clips and special features and a disappointment for collectors who want the seasons on their shelves.,2,Why only one full season??

815957,ABWHLZFEM5SZY,B0001XAKEM,R. Jensen,"[0, 0]","Seeing as this is the only ""Best of Big Brother blank"" dvd and coming after a full season release of a previous season, this dvd is a big let down for fans who want more. Had there been more dvds like this, there wouldn't as much negativity because it would be a reguler thing. Seeing as now this is one of TWO dvds released for Big Brother EVER, and it comes after a full season set, it earns bad marks from me.But let me tell you, even if this was a complete dvd set, I wouldn't rank it any higher as I feel out of the first four seasons of Big Brother, this is the worst. Where as I'm not a big fan of 2 due to the omnipresent negative athmosphere and a winner I never completly liked, this season ended up as a major dissapointment. The twist was interesting, (but really make it even or at least 7-6 not 8-5) and the season felt fast paced and was a roller coaster as control constantly shifted. However that last praise causes one of the season's downfalls. In previous seasons I felt it took awhile for major characters to leave, here I feel they left MUCH earlier and that hurts the season.Downfall #2 is the last veto competition, I feel as if having a final four veto does not work. Why? Because if a nominee wins it, most of the time they will save themselves and vote for the person that replaces them. To me there is far less reason to use it, in order to ensure your fellow nominee would leave. Yes there is a trust factor both ways, but still. Spoiler Alert No Names,(Yes I'm coming from a biased opinion, had the two non nominees won I wouldn't be complaining).Finally, this seasons top two I feel suck. Now it is possible to be low key for most of the season and I'll like you and want you to win(Lisa, Monica, Robert, many Survivor people, one winner of Hell's Kitchen) but these two I didn't like nor support. Once the 3rd place person left, I stopped watching and looked up who won as I didn't care who won, that was a first, even Survivor Thiland and Marquases which I dispise I didn't skip anything, I stuck it out. Here I didn't care...So like with Survivor Marquases and Endurance High Serrias a bad final/winner ruins what could've been a good season that turned into one bad reality season. (Bearly I would've ranked it below 3 and 1 anyway.)",2,Bad dvd and bad season,1363478400,"03 17, 2013",2013,2268,"['Seeing', 'only', 'Best', 'Big', 'Brother', 'blank', 'dvd', 'coming', 'full', 'season', 'release', 'previous', 'season', 'dvd', 'big', 'let', 'down', 'fans', 'who', 'want', 'more', 'Had', 'been', 'more', 'dvds', 'would', ""n't"", 'as', 'much', 'negativity', 'would', 'be', 'reguler', 'thing', 'Seeing', 'as', 'now', 'one', 'TWO', 'dvds', 'released', 'Big', 'Brother', 'EVER', 'full', 'season', 'set', 'bad', 'marks', 'me.But', 'let', 'tell', 'even', 'was', 'complete', 'dvd', 'set', 'would', ""n't"", 'rank', 'higher', 'feel', 'first', 'four', 'seasons', 'Big', 'Brother', 'worst', 'Where', ""'m"", 'not', 'big', 'fan', '2', 'due', 'omnipresent', 'negative', 'athmosphere', 'winner', 'never', 'completly', 'liked', 'season', 'ended', 'up', 'major', 'dissapointment', 'twist', 'was', 'interesting', 'really', 'make', 'even', 'least', '7-6', 'not', '8-5', 'season', 'felt', 'fast', 'paced', 'was', 'roller', 'coaster', 'control', 'constantly', 'shifted', 'However', 'last', 'praise', 'one', 'season', 'downfalls', 'previous', 'seasons', 'felt', 'took', 'awhile', 'major', 'characters', 'leave', 'here', 'feel', 'left', 'MUCH', 'earlier', 'season.Downfall', '2', 'last', 'veto', 'competition', 'feel', 'having', 'final', 'four', 'veto', 'not', 'work', 'Why', 'nominee', 'most', 'time', 'will', 'save', 'vote', 'person', 'far', 'less', 'reason', 'use', 'order', 'ensure', 'fellow', 'nominee', 'would', 'leave', 'Yes', 'trust', 'factor', 'ways', 'still', 'Spoiler', 'Alert', 'No', 'Names', 'Yes', ""'m"", 'coming', 'biased', 'opinion', 'had', 'two', 'non', 'nominees', 'won', 'would', ""n't"", 'be', 'complaining', '.Finally', 'seasons', 'top', 'two', 'feel', 'suck', 'Now', 'possible', 'be', 'low', 'key', 'most', 'season', ""'ll"", 'like', 'want', 'win', 'Lisa', 'Monica', 'Robert', 'many', 'Survivor', 'people', 'one', 'winner', 'Hell', 'Kitchen', 'two', 'did', ""n't"", 'like', 'support', '3rd', 'place', 'person', 'left', 'stopped', 'watching', 'looked', 'up', 'who', 'won', 'did', ""n't"", 'care', 'who', 'won', 'was', 'first', 'even', 'Survivor', 'Thiland', 'Marquases', 'dispise', 'did', ""n't"", 'skip', 'anything', 'stuck', 'out', 'Here', 'did', ""n't"", 'care', 'So', 'Survivor', 'Marquases', 'Endurance', 'High', 'Serrias', 'bad', 'final/winner', 'what', 'could', ""'ve"", 'been', 'good', 'season', 'turned', 'one', 'bad', 'reality', 'season', 'Bearly', 'would', ""'ve"", 'ranked', '3', '1', 'anyway']",The Best of Big Brother 4 - X-Factor
815958,A37S3ACL57LN62,B0001XAKEM,"Samantha Glasser ""Maliejandra""","[17, 17]","Big Brother 4 was the first season to introduce houseguests that already knew each other. With a twist that spawned two more seasons with similar twists, five of the eight ""original"" houseguests had ex-boyfriends or ex-girlfriends walk into the house as opponents. Scott's girlfriend Amanda, David's girlfriend Michelle, Jun's boyfriend Jee, Erika's boyfriend Robert, and Alison's boyfriend Justin made up the final houseguests of the season, making a group of 13. Jack, Nathan, and Dana were the only houseguests without an ex in the house. This season started out with targets on the ex's backs, but subgroups formed and created a highly entertaining, although disappointing summer.Not only is this not the complete season of Big Brother 4, it is an incomplete promo disk for the worst season. Thanks largely to the whining annoying Alison, one cannot help but be extremely aggravated throughout the season. However, this is not the whole season.
