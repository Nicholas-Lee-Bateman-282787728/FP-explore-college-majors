495520,A31O7B59DW7OHR,B000009RXS,Gene Bromberg,"[6, 7]","This was one of my all-time favorites when I was a kid, and now that I've finally seen it again after 20 years I'm pleased to find that my sense of humor was razor-sharp even then. Why &quot;Animalympics&quot; isn't a  staple on Cartoon Network and Blockbuster is beyond me.As if you need  an explanation, it's about an Olympics starring animals. Just like network  TV coverage you have your anchorman and announcers at each event (some of  whom are of course impersonations of well-known announcers and are  hilarious). The voices, supplied by Crystal, Radner and Shearer are  brilliant. Kids today might not recognize the blustering voice of Howard  Cosell, but it's still funny on its own.Some of the events are  laugh-out-loud funny. The hockey game is a hoot. The swimming and diving  events. The marathon, of course. The absolute best, however, is the boxing  match, with Crystal doing a Cosell-Ali interview that stuck in my mind all  these years as an all-time classic. Just hearing that name, &quot;Joey  Gongalong&quot; is enough to get the giggles going.There are brief  character interviews that are at times a bit bizarre, but they're no  cheesier than the bits you'll see on NBC this summer. And the music, while  very seventies, set a nice nostalgic tone. My only criticism is the part  with the skier going up the mountain &amp; finding &quot;Dogra-La&quot;,  which was just plain stupid and didn't mesh with the rest of the movie.But that's a minor quibble in a cartoon that is still a favorite. Great  animation, great voices and writing...if you get the chance, see this  movie.",5,Viva la victory,962150400,"06 28, 2000",2000,1597,"['was', 'one', 'all-time', 'favorites', 'when', 'was', 'kid', 'now', ""'ve"", 'finally', 'seen', 'again', '20', 'years', ""'m"", 'pleased', 'find', 'sense', 'humor', 'was', 'razor-sharp', 'even', 'then', 'Why', 'quot', 'Animalympics', 'quot', ""n't"", 'staple', 'Cartoon', 'Network', 'Blockbuster', 'me.As', 'need', 'explanation', 'Olympics', 'starring', 'animals', 'Just', 'network', 'TV', 'coverage', 'have', 'anchorman', 'announcers', 'event', 'whom', 'are', 'course', 'impersonations', 'well-known', 'announcers', 'are', 'hilarious', 'voices', 'supplied', 'Crystal', 'Radner', 'Shearer', 'are', 'brilliant', 'Kids', 'today', 'might', 'not', 'recognize', 'blustering', 'voice', 'Howard', 'Cosell', 'still', 'funny', 'own.Some', 'events', 'are', 'laugh-out-loud', 'funny', 'hockey', 'game', 'hoot', 'swimming', 'diving', 'events', 'marathon', 'course', 'absolute', 'best', 'however', 'boxing', 'match', 'Crystal', 'doing', 'Cosell-Ali', 'interview', 'stuck', 'mind', 'years', 'all-time', 'classic', 'Just', 'hearing', 'name', 'quot', 'Joey', 'Gongalong', 'quot', 'enough', 'get', 'giggles', 'are', 'brief', 'character', 'interviews', 'are', 'times', 'bit', 'bizarre', ""'re"", 'cheesier', 'bits', ""'ll"", 'see', 'NBC', 'summer', 'music', 'very', 'seventies', 'set', 'nice', 'nostalgic', 'tone', 'only', 'criticism', 'part', 'skier', 'going', 'up', 'mountain', 'amp', 'finding', 'quot', 'Dogra-La', 'quot', 'was', 'just', 'plain', 'stupid', 'did', ""n't"", 'mesh', 'rest', 'movie.But', 'minor', 'quibble', 'cartoon', 'still', 'favorite', 'Great', 'animation', 'great', 'voices', 'writing', 'get', 'chance', 'see', 'movie']",Animalympics VHS

495522,A24GYTKSRBTR7P,B000009RXS,Matt Hanke,"[10, 10]","Many people, unless they happened to have HBO in the early '80s, have probably never even seen or heard of this remarkable little animated gem, which is really a shame.Made in 1979, but never given a theatrical release, &quot;Animalympics&quot; is a rather delightful film set on an island that is inhabited by animals from all over the world whose single interest in life, it seems, is to compete in the Olympic games.Featuring the voice talents of Billy Crystal and Gilda Radner, the writing and directorial talents of Steven Lisberger (of &quot;TRON&quot; fame), plus an awesome soundtrack by 10CC's Graham Gouldman, &quot;Animalympics&quot; is a wonderful film that can be enjoyed by anyone, no matter how young or old that person may be.  I mean, I was probably around 7 years old the first time I watched it, now I'm 23 and I still love this movie!!If you haven't seen this one yet, you've got to.  Trust me, if you love movies about animation, animals and/or sports, &quot;Animalympics&quot; is the perfect movie for you!!&quot;VIVA LA VICTORY&quot;!!!(Here's a quick sidenote about the video quality.  Normally, I would recommend avoiding any video put out by United American Video because their video quality is usually just plain lousy.  However, their &quot;gold&quot; edition, clamshell package release of &quot;Animalympics&quot; is actually quite good.  Granted the film hasn't been digitally remastered, but it has been copied in the SP mode, instead of the cheap EP mode which UAV, as well as most other smaller video companies, usually copies their videos in.  To sum it all up, the copy I purchased played just fine.)",4,Steven Lisberger Does It Again!!,998352000,"08 21, 2001",2001,1635,"['Many', 'people', 'happened', 'have', 'HBO', 'early', ""'80s"", 'have', 'probably', 'never', 'even', 'seen', 'heard', 'remarkable', 'little', 'animated', 'gem', 'really', 'shame.Made', '1979', 'never', 'given', 'theatrical', 'release', 'quot', 'Animalympics', 'quot', 'rather', 'delightful', 'film', 'set', 'island', 'inhabited', 'animals', 'world', 'single', 'interest', 'life', 'compete', 'Olympic', 'games.Featuring', 'voice', 'talents', 'Billy', 'Crystal', 'Gilda', 'Radner', 'writing', 'directorial', 'talents', 'Steven', 'Lisberger', 'quot', 'TRON', 'quot', 'fame', 'awesome', 'soundtrack', '10CC', 'Graham', 'Gouldman', 'quot', 'Animalympics', 'quot', 'wonderful', 'film', 'can', 'be', 'enjoyed', 'anyone', 'matter', 'how', 'young', 'old', 'person', 'may', 'be', 'mean', 'was', 'probably', '7', 'years', 'old', 'first', 'time', 'watched', 'now', ""'m"", '23', 'still', 'love', 'movie', 'have', ""n't"", 'seen', 'one', 'yet', ""'ve"", 'got', 'Trust', 'love', 'movies', 'animation', 'animals', 'and/or', 'sports', 'quot', 'Animalympics', 'quot', 'perfect', 'movie', 'quot', 'VIVA', 'LA', 'VICTORY', 'quot', 'Here', 'quick', 'sidenote', 'video', 'quality', 'Normally', 'would', 'recommend', 'avoiding', 'video', 'put', 'out', 'United', 'American', 'Video', 'video', 'quality', 'usually', 'just', 'plain', 'lousy', 'However', 'quot', 'gold', 'quot', 'edition', 'clamshell', 'package', 'release', 'quot', 'Animalympics', 'quot', 'actually', 'quite', 'good', 'Granted', 'film', ""n't"", 'been', 'digitally', 'remastered', 'been', 'copied', 'SP', 'mode', 'instead', 'cheap', 'EP', 'mode', 'UAV', 'as', 'well', 'most', 'other', 'smaller', 'video', 'companies', 'usually', 'videos', 'sum', 'up', 'copy', 'purchased', 'played', 'just', 'fine']",Animalympics VHS
495523,A2L9L5B6BWF05E,B000009RXS,"PcBuddy ""John M""","[0, 0]","This is one of my favorite movies! I first saw it on HBO, for which only aired it a few times every 4 years. After a heart break in not seeing it air, I re-discover it on the Disney Channel. I then remember temporarily subscribing to Disney Channel to videotape the movie. I was surprised to see it on home video by UAV gold in 1995, since the movie was originaly prodced by Mr. Lisberger in 1979. Anyway, I found that this movie was quite entertaining and inspiring to all who attempt to achieve their life's ambitions and goals. The animal characters were well drawn, and especailly the females were given a more womanly-like figure, which was great and sexy-like. The movie does shine off and reflect the 1970's, which is when love, and sex was a big thing back then. I do get a laugh at the comical outcome from all the events. I admit that famous figure skater Dorthy Tournell did steal my heart away with her great figure skating, but she was very emotional and proud to get the gold.My fave was also the Fencing scene. Sure the large warthog of the Count had won the gold medal by cheating and bringing everyone down, but it took the surprise appearance of an avengeful female Hawk named Contessa to teach him a lesson, and she did. I loved her Italian accent and she is good looking as well. You have to laugh when she flips the count with her feet, sending the count to the corner, and has a hard time getting up, while the Contessa teases the count by pointing her foil tip at the count's belly and swirls it, while the count is in shock and attempts to bring up his bulk hoping she will miss, but then ""BUZZZ."" She get him and get the gold, courtesy from Duke Travis.",5,Go For The Gold!,1124409600,"08 19, 2005",2005,1678,"['one', 'favorite', 'movies', 'first', 'saw', 'HBO', 'only', 'aired', 'few', 'times', '4', 'years', 'heart', 'break', 'not', 'seeing', 'air', 're-discover', 'Disney', 'Channel', 'then', 'remember', 'temporarily', 'subscribing', 'Disney', 'Channel', 'videotape', 'movie', 'was', 'surprised', 'see', 'home', 'video', 'UAV', 'gold', '1995', 'movie', 'was', 'originaly', 'prodced', 'Mr.', 'Lisberger', '1979', 'Anyway', 'found', 'movie', 'was', 'quite', 'entertaining', 'inspiring', 'who', 'attempt', 'achieve', 'life', 'ambitions', 'goals', 'animal', 'characters', 'were', 'well', 'drawn', 'especailly', 'females', 'were', 'given', 'more', 'womanly-like', 'figure', 'was', 'great', 'sexy-like', 'movie', 'shine', 'reflect', '1970', 'when', 'love', 'sex', 'was', 'big', 'thing', 'back', 'then', 'do', 'get', 'laugh', 'comical', 'outcome', 'events', 'admit', 'famous', 'figure', 'skater', 'Dorthy', 'Tournell', 'did', 'steal', 'heart', 'away', 'great', 'figure', 'skating', 'was', 'very', 'emotional', 'proud', 'get', 'gold.My', 'fave', 'was', 'also', 'Fencing', 'scene', 'large', 'warthog', 'Count', 'had', 'won', 'gold', 'medal', 'cheating', 'bringing', 'everyone', 'down', 'took', 'surprise', 'appearance', 'avengeful', 'female', 'Hawk', 'named', 'Contessa', 'teach', 'lesson', 'did', 'loved', 'Italian', 'accent', 'good', 'looking', 'as', 'well', 'have', 'laugh', 'when', 'count', 'feet', 'sending', 'count', 'corner', 'hard', 'time', 'getting', 'up', 'Contessa', 'count', 'pointing', 'foil', 'tip', 'count', 'belly', 'swirls', 'count', 'shock', 'attempts', 'bring', 'up', 'bulk', 'hoping', 'will', 'miss', 'then', 'BUZZZ', 'get', 'get', 'gold', 'courtesy', 'Duke', 'Travis']",Animalympics VHS
495524,A3XIJ6YQMIS4R,B000009RXS,"Read Sonja ""nonseqtr""","[6, 6]","I can't speak for the quality of the VHS version since I'm waiting for this to come out on DVD, but anyone who enjoys classic cartoons should love this film. Just as for many other people this was a favorite as a child. I think my siblings and I wore out the copy at our local video store from renting it so many times. Anyone who remembers the style of Olympic coverage in the 1970s will recognize the way the story is presented and appreciate what a good spoof it is. The animation, while a bit dated by today's standards, is still quite good and rich in detail. There are some wonderful vocal performances by celebrities (as mentioned in other reviews) doing animal impersonations of famous news personalities of the time such as Howard Cosell and Barbara Walters (kids will just enjoy the accent). Also notable are many wonderful musical numbers. There are plenty of quality pieces in here that should appeal to people of all ages. (My personal favorite is the funky underwater number for the diving competition, starring an otter with a stereotypical california surfer accent.) The humor is fairly broad and not especially subtle but should still be able to hold  adult attention for those who choose to watch with their children. There is some violence, and injury is done to characters in an over-the-top humorous fashion, not to mention some mildly suggestive moments, but I don't think even particularly careful parents should find anything too offensive for children to watch. In fact many of the themes encourage good sportsmanship, goal-oriented effort and avoiding the problems of obsessive behavior. It is very 70's, I think, in it's emphasis on individuality and putting the pursuit of happiness in perspective. All in all, I think this is an excellent animated film which should appeal to both those who are looking for enjoyable family movies and those who collect classics in the animation genre. And for all adult viewers, Rene Fromage may have a great musical number, but the show stealer is still Kit Mambo!
