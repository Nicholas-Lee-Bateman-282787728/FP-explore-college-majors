1055893,A31A9GENAJYD64,B000ND91WC,David M. Rossi,"[7, 8]","With Sandlot 2 being more of a remake than sequel to the first fun filled romp about chasing your dreams and growing up, the Sandlot 3 Heading Home is a refreshing new take on the idea. A major leaguer is caught in the commercialism and material trappings associated with the wealth of ball players and needs to get back to basics: the love of the game. hit on the head with a ricocheted ball off a sign while fireworks are going off, Santorelli  is transported backward in time and is back home on the sandlot with the boys he called friends and a team when he was 12 back in 1976. the bond they share helps Santorelli right a lot of wrongs in his life and ultimately changes his fate in positive ways. Benny the Jet Rodriguez is back as the then major leaguer that never lost sight of his roots and Squints is back as well, adding more original cast appeal as a supporting player in a cast filled with leading kids who are on a much higher acting level than the kids of the second movie. The Sandlot 3 Heading Home is a great new take on the ideals of the franchise and is indicative of the kind of good values movies we should be encouraging all of our kids to see. There is something for everyone to love in the film, whether you're 8 or 80, but the film's most obvious audience member targets are those who were close in age to the kids in the movie back in '76 as I was. With every bit of heart as high as the original, Sandlot Heading Home should be added to your must see list. 5 stars",5,a worthy sequel,1205020800,"03 9, 2008",2008,1493,"['Sandlot', '2', 'being', 'more', 'remake', 'sequel', 'first', 'fun', 'filled', 'romp', 'chasing', 'dreams', 'growing', 'up', 'Sandlot', '3', 'Heading', 'Home', 'refreshing', 'new', 'take', 'idea', 'major', 'leaguer', 'caught', 'commercialism', 'material', 'trappings', 'associated', 'wealth', 'ball', 'players', 'needs', 'get', 'back', 'basics', 'love', 'game', 'hit', 'head', 'ricocheted', 'ball', 'sign', 'fireworks', 'are', 'going', 'off', 'Santorelli', 'transported', 'backward', 'time', 'back', 'home', 'sandlot', 'boys', 'called', 'friends', 'team', 'when', 'was', '12', 'back', '1976.', 'bond', 'share', 'Santorelli', 'right', 'lot', 'wrongs', 'life', 'ultimately', 'fate', 'positive', 'ways', 'Jet', 'Rodriguez', 'back', 'then', 'major', 'leaguer', 'never', 'lost', 'sight', 'roots', 'Squints', 'back', 'as', 'well', 'adding', 'more', 'original', 'cast', 'appeal', 'supporting', 'player', 'cast', 'filled', 'leading', 'kids', 'who', 'are', 'much', 'higher', 'acting', 'level', 'kids', 'second', 'movie', 'Sandlot', '3', 'Heading', 'Home', 'great', 'new', 'take', 'ideals', 'franchise', 'indicative', 'kind', 'good', 'values', 'movies', 'should', 'be', 'encouraging', 'kids', 'see', 'something', 'everyone', 'love', 'film', ""'re"", '8', '80', 'film', 'most', 'obvious', 'audience', 'member', 'targets', 'are', 'who', 'were', 'close', 'age', 'kids', 'movie', 'back', 'was', 'bit', 'heart', 'as', 'high', 'original', 'Sandlot', 'Heading', 'Home', 'should', 'be', 'added', 'must', 'see', 'list', '5', 'stars']",N/A

While the 2nd movie made just vague references to the events of the first movie, this one seems much more linked to the original, even going as far as having two characters from the first movie (Benny and Squints) appear.  Squints is even played by the same actor, all grown up now and he looks just the same.  The two of them reminisce about old times and even mention the Great Hambino, now a pro wrestler.  The movie itself was standard fare for this type.  Decent story, decent acting by the new kids, nothing really special.
