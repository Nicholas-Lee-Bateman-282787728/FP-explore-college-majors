""Cole""","[0, 0]","I'm an avid Amazing Race fan and having seen nearly every seen aired so far, I would have to say that Season Four is one of my favorites.  The casting was superb and the drama that ensued throughout the race was addicting.  There was one scene where a team threatened to slash another team's tires and there were two car crashes in back-to-back episodes.  Some of the phrases uttered were laughably memorable and the places ventured were absolutely gorgeous and full of history.  The breadth of the season is quite expansive and I absolutely adored every minute of it.  I will have to say that Chip and Reichen are my favorite team to have ever run the race (paired with Colin & Christie, Jonathan & Victoria, Jet & Cord, and Bopper & Mark).  This season is full of laughs, surprises, and just quality entertainment.  You will not regret purchasing this set!",5,Probably my favorite season of TAR,1340150400,"06 20, 2012",2012,858,"[""'m"", 'avid', 'Amazing', 'Race', 'fan', 'having', 'seen', 'nearly', 'seen', 'aired', 'so', 'far', 'would', 'have', 'say', 'Season', 'Four', 'one', 'favorites', 'casting', 'was', 'superb', 'drama', 'ensued', 'race', 'was', 'addicting', 'was', 'one', 'scene', 'where', 'team', 'threatened', 'slash', 'team', 'tires', 'were', 'two', 'car', 'crashes', 'back-to-back', 'episodes', 'phrases', 'uttered', 'were', 'laughably', 'memorable', 'places', 'ventured', 'were', 'absolutely', 'gorgeous', 'full', 'history', 'breadth', 'season', 'quite', 'expansive', 'absolutely', 'adored', 'minute', 'will', 'have', 'say', 'Chip', 'Reichen', 'are', 'favorite', 'team', 'have', 'ever', 'run', 'race', 'paired', 'Colin', 'Christie', 'Jonathan', 'Victoria', 'Jet', 'Cord', 'Bopper', 'Mark', 'season', 'full', 'laughs', 'surprises', 'just', 'quality', 'entertainment', 'will', 'not', 'regret', 'purchasing', 'set']",The Amazing Race: Season 4

The season brought TAR its 2nd Emmy at a time when the show's future was in doubt.  And the Emmy was well deserved with season 4's mix of drama and fierce competition.
