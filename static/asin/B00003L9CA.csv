545417,ANCOMAI0I7LVG,B00003L9CA,Andrew Ellington,"[2, 2]","I walked into this film blind.  I just saw the title and the actors (named Binoche) and remembered my complete obsession over another French bridge movie (The Girl on the Bridge, from 2000) and just felt this rush of excitement as I sat down to watch this movie.  The funny thing is that this movie is absolutely NOTHING like I expected it to be and yet it was everything I could have ever wanted.  First of all, this is not a sweeping romantic film.  It isn't pretty, in the typical sense (although the cinematography is lush and brilliantly used).  Instead, this is a rather densely broken tale about unexpected lovers who build a life on a bridge under construction.Upon the film's opening we see Alex, a homeless street performer, collapse in a drunken stupor and get practically run over.  In the same breath, we see Michelle walking through the streets carrying a portfolio of her artwork.  Next thing you know, they are sharing a bridge and concealing secrets and falling in love.  Michelle is suffering from a severe disease that is corroding her eyesight and has obviously wreaked havoc on her life (since it becomes rather obvious early on that she at one time was wealthy) and so now she is living a life of destitution.  Michelle is distant and reserved and obviously shielding herself from affections, but Alex thrusts himself into her life and starts to (rather aggressively) build a relationship with her.  They complement one another and draw each other out in ways that others could not.But love is never easy, especially if you're homeless.Binoche and Lavant build very complex characters and develop them thoroughly throughout the film, even without letting us know their pasts entirely (there is still much mystery left to Michelle's past, even at the film's closing).  We feel as though we know them inside and out, and that is a feat in itself.  Really though, this is Leos Carax's story and his film and he carries it marvelously.  The film is visually enriched by sharp cinematography and an understanding of the importance of emotional conveyance through imagery.This is a love affair that is far removed from what we are used to.  It isn't glamorous or lavish and yet it feels all the more earnest and sincere.  When the film ends, you will most definitely be moved!",5,Broken bridges...,1347321600,"09 11, 2012",2012,2292,"['walked', 'film', 'blind', 'just', 'saw', 'title', 'actors', 'named', 'Binoche', 'remembered', 'complete', 'obsession', 'French', 'bridge', 'movie', 'Girl', 'Bridge', '2000', 'just', 'felt', 'rush', 'excitement', 'sat', 'down', 'watch', 'movie', 'funny', 'thing', 'movie', 'absolutely', 'NOTHING', 'expected', 'be', 'yet', 'was', 'everything', 'could', 'have', 'ever', 'wanted', 'First', 'all', 'not', 'sweeping', 'romantic', 'film', ""n't"", 'pretty', 'typical', 'sense', 'cinematography', 'lush', 'brilliantly', 'used', 'Instead', 'rather', 'densely', 'broken', 'tale', 'unexpected', 'lovers', 'who', 'build', 'life', 'bridge', 'construction.Upon', 'film', 'opening', 'see', 'Alex', 'homeless', 'street', 'performer', 'collapse', 'drunken', 'stupor', 'get', 'practically', 'run', 'over', 'same', 'breath', 'see', 'Michelle', 'walking', 'streets', 'carrying', 'portfolio', 'artwork', 'Next', 'thing', 'know', 'are', 'sharing', 'bridge', 'concealing', 'secrets', 'falling', 'love', 'Michelle', 'suffering', 'severe', 'disease', 'corroding', 'eyesight', 'obviously', 'wreaked', 'havoc', 'life', 'rather', 'obvious', 'early', 'one', 'time', 'was', 'wealthy', 'so', 'now', 'living', 'life', 'destitution', 'Michelle', 'distant', 'reserved', 'obviously', 'shielding', 'affections', 'Alex', 'life', 'rather', 'aggressively', 'build', 'relationship', 'complement', 'one', 'draw', 'other', 'out', 'ways', 'others', 'could', 'not.But', 'love', 'never', 'easy', 'especially', ""'re"", 'homeless.Binoche', 'Lavant', 'build', 'very', 'complex', 'characters', 'develop', 'thoroughly', 'film', 'even', 'letting', 'know', 'pasts', 'entirely', 'still', 'much', 'mystery', 'left', 'Michelle', 'past', 'even', 'film', 'closing', 'feel', 'know', 'inside', 'feat', 'Really', 'Leos', 'Carax', 'story', 'film', 'marvelously', 'film', 'visually', 'enriched', 'sharp', 'cinematography', 'understanding', 'importance', 'emotional', 'conveyance', 'imagery.This', 'love', 'affair', 'far', 'removed', 'what', 'are', 'used', ""n't"", 'glamorous', 'lavish', 'yet', 'more', 'earnest', 'sincere', 'When', 'film', 'will', 'most', 'definitely', 'be', 'moved']",The Lovers on the Bridge VHS
545418,A4VH04TA14CPE,B00003L9CA,"Angry Mofo ""angrymofo""","[8, 12]","""Lovers On The Bridge"" is notorious, but not very popular. It caused a big scandal in France, not because of its content, but because of the caprices of its director Leos Carax. Much of the film takes place on the Pont-Neuf bridge in Paris, and Carax demanded to be allowed to film right on the bridge. So, the bridge was closed off just for him, and even then he couldn't finish filming. After he was kicked out, he built a life-size model of the bridge and part of its surroundings, somewhere in the countryside, and tried to finish filming there. Even then he went over budget three times, thus causing three separate producers to go bankrupt.The film was a complete failure, commercially. Critics thought it was too long and too self-important. The public just didn't bother to see it. As a result, Carax's career was basically over by 1992. Since then he's only made one film, ""Pola X"" in 1999. (There's word that he's making another one right now, though.)What is ""Lovers On The Bridge"" about? It stars Carax's favourite actor Denis Lavant as Alex, a bum who lives on the Pont-Neuf. Sometimes he puts on a fire-eating act to entertain passersby on the street. The rest of the time, he gets drunk. He's also addicted to pills of some kind.One day, a woman shows up on the bridge. She doesn't talk about her past, but Alex finds out that she comes from a rich family. She was abandoned by her rich boyfriend, and she has a problem with her eyesight which will eventually make her blind. Because of these problems, she decides to run away from home and go slumming on the Pont-Neuf.Naturally, Alex falls madly in love with her. They cavort on the bridge together and steal money from rich tourists. Then of course they're separated. Alex does a whole bunch of desperate and stupid things and loses his will to live. Maybe you can guess whether or not they're reunited in the end.Carax's underlying worldview in this film is exactly the same as in his two earlier films, ""Boy Meets Girl"" and ""Bad Blood."" He believes in a thing called love, you see. But his idea of love has a lot of narcissism in it. His lovers are hopelessly self-absorbed. They can never have any kind of normal life together, simply because they would be unable to support each other. They can get drunk together, but they can't feel so much compassion or empathy. Alex, in particular, is a psychopath. He tries to prevent the woman from curing her eye problem, because he doesn't want her to leave the bridge.And Carax also believes that the sensory impact of a film is more important than the logic of its narrative. So, this film contains many vivid, visually brilliant scenes that don't make much sense if you think about them. For example, Carax thinks that guns are romantic, so he puts a gun into the film and uses it in a long dream sequence. The sequence doesn't have much bearing on the plot, and actually it makes his heroine look cold and vicious, but it's exciting to watch.The greatest scene of this sort is the one where the lovers celebrate Bastille Day by screaming and doing cartwheels on the bridge, to a deafening medley of classical, rock and rap music. The content of the scene has no meaning. But the effect is ecstatic. And in a way, it really captures a youthful feeling of falling in love.If Carax's worldview doesn't appeal to you, then you'll probably agree with the critics who savaged the film. They have a point. But still, ""Lovers On The Bridge"" is Carax's best film.First of all, he has a much stronger script than before. His two earlier films are full of long, artificial monologues, which are recited into space by the characters. But here, the dialogue is much more terse. Alex doesn't say much at all, and this is very appropriate to his character.Second, Carax paid attention to the setting of his story. The plot might not be very believable. Of course that's the point. Carax wants to overwhelm the emotions by any means necessary. But nonetheless, the opening of the film just shows a few scenes taken at a homeless shelter in Paris. They are unrelated to the plot, and the main characters don't appear in them. But they make a very strong impression. Carax shows the bad conditions in which his characters live, without making anything up. Somehow, this realistic introduction makes the rest of the film much more convincing.Third, the romance is just a little bit more subtle than in Carax's earlier films. In ""Bad Blood,"" for instance, it was hard to see why Julie Delpy loved Denis Lavant so much, since his character there was basically the same as here. But here, Carax implies that the heroine isn't quite in love with Alex. Or rather, she is, but only up to a point. She loves him while she's slumming on the bridge, but she doesn't want to take him with her when she leaves. She shows no concern for him when he suffers the most from her absence. She does remember him later, but she only wants to see him on her own terms. In other words, she's like him. That's not very nice, and in fact the main characters of this film are not nice people, but it's believable at least. It's also hard to see why she went down to the bridge in the first place, if she's like that, but that's not really the point. Carax needs the bridge because it allows him to make his grand spectacles.I honestly don't know if I'd recommend this film. It's alternately unpleasant and thrilling. But it is Carax's best film. There's nothing else that's quite like that.",3,Crazed and self-destructive.,1156982400,"08 31, 2006",2006,5465,"['Lovers', 'Bridge', 'notorious', 'not', 'very', 'popular', 'caused', 'big', 'scandal',

It does begin interesting, proceeds Ok but then things start to creep.  Does her lover really love her?  To me, he is a dangerous psycho and he does not stop at hurting her by keeping her uninformed.  Wouldn't we judge someone like that as a heartless and cruel criminal?  Why all this sobbing that he really loved her? Do we indeed imagine this as a true love story?  And then at the end, like it wasn't enough suffering and beating for her, he almost drowns her and then both become happy and serene and rejoice in their escape.  This is hardly a role-model romance, a perfect case of male rage, obsessiveness and violence - what is it to admire?  In the very least, it is an expression of a really barbaric, brutal and animalistic instinct of male ownership over a woman.  Perfect case of abuse - I wonder how all who marvel at this film would feel if they've been knocked into the river Seine in the middle of winter as an expression of their sweetheart's love for them...  Love - no, sorry, this is absurd.  In addition, the ""lover"" does seem to be mentally retarded and in my opinion, is not an attractive personality in the very least.  But even if he was attractive...  It puzzles me that there are always people who would admire the most gruesome behavior by confusing it with love - didn't he know that she desired to get her sight back, more than anything in the world?  Would not real lover do anything to satisfy her desire, to help her get it back, even if it meant breaking up with him?  That what true love really is.  And for her part - thanks for portraying again a woman who enjoys being abused. I find the story rather ...non-convincing, although the acting is good.

545420,A2P49WD75WHAG5,B00003L9CA,Daniel J. Hamlow,"[4, 7]","Set in the days before and after France's bicentennial, Les Amants du Pont-Neuf tells the story of three homeless people who have been cheated by life.  First is Alex, a street performer who seeks refuge in alcohol and downers.  Hans, an elderly bearded man who bears a resemblance to Jack Elam, provides Alex with the downers.  And then there's Michele, a homeless artist with a bandage over her left eye.  All three proceed to make the Pont-Neuf bridge in Paris their home.  This is possible because the bridge is under repairs and renovation and closed to the public for two years.Hans though, does not like Michele and repeatedly tells her she must leave.  Alex convinces him to let her stay for a couple days.  A bond develops between the two, and the two share some of that bicentennial magic of fireworks for some heavy drinking and cruising in a police patrol boat, with Michele water-skiing.  However, Michele has periods when she is tired out--she even blacks out when she is drawing Alex.  Turns out she is going blind in her remaining eye.  In contrast, without his downers, Alex can't go to sleep.  Opposites if anything.  Hans detects the feelings Alex has for Michele and tells him &quot;Look around.  There's no love here!  There's no cold air in bedrooms.  It doesn't fit your life.  Forget it!&quot;  He later tells Michele that life outside is not right for her, and it's up to her to live.As her condition worsens, Michele tells her that the &quot;world's just a lot of blurry flames and I'm sick of it.&quot;  That is mirrored in a scene when Alex sets fire to a row of posters along the subway hallways, a great visual effect, as there are posters on both walls, utilizing a symmetry akin to Kubrick.The bridge symbolizes the stage of life for a person, from point A to point B.  In the beginning, it is in disrepair, under renovation, as are the lives of the three protagonists.  At the end of the movie, the bridge has been renovated.  &quot;Nothing is irreparable&quot; Michele tells Alex.  For some people, that may be true, but countless others are damaged beyond repair.The sequence in the bus carrying the wounded Alex and the scene in the shelter is a very oppressive segment and it's a bit of tough going through due to the characters who seek refuge in the shelter.  And for the leisure pacing of this movie, it's a bit long at near two hours.Juliette Binoche (Michele) is amazing here because she is not her usual glamorous self.  With the bandage on her eye, pale face, disheveled and fatigued look, she is far from the composer's widow in Blue, the idealistic Tereza in The Unbearable Likeness Of Being, or Vianne in Chocolat.  Denis Divant (Alex) does a good job in bringing to life someone trying to make sense of a new set of circumstances (Michele's arrival).

This is a reluctant love story to say the least but the selection of three odd bods as characters to highlight the problems of homelessness in modern urban societies is a very real device indeed.Viewers may wish to watch this in conjunction with Subway, to gain a little different perspective. I think that the thematic element of art which ties all three together acts to expose the commonly held view of what constitutes art to the test. These disparate group of artists suffer much for their artbut because there is not the popular acclaim they are consigned to the dustbin of history.What I find particularly interesting is the development of the character of the fireater who performs to free public acclaim but who drowns his personal problems in alcohol and downers. As the film progresses he slowly begins to change into a more ""normal"" type of a person who can express his emotions through interacting with a self-pitying selfish woman who is becoming blind.There is more than a touch of the surreal throughout the movie and much pathos but within an urban context where there is little consideration for the down and outs such that drivers never even notice them as they drive over them on the street. Is this what modern life has become?My main reservation is about the happy ending which just seems to be out of place given the storyline.

545426,A3O2RCKAMSE9X7,B00003L9CA,Martin Asiner,"[10, 16]","THE LOVERS ON THE BRIDGE is a confusing movie. Director Leos Carax clearly wants the audience to sympathise with the plight of the two stars, Alex, played by Denis Lavant, and Michelle, by Juliette Binoche. As the film begins, the viewer sees that both Alex and Michele suffer from ego-shattering crises. In her case, she suffers from an eye disease that is gradually worsening to a state of total loss of vision. Further, she has just been dumped by her lover.  Totally bereft of hope, she joins the small army of homeless who live on or near Paris's Pont-Neuf Bridge.  Alex suffers too, but Carax chooses not to inform the audience why he has degenerated both physically and mentally.  He wanders the streets near the bridge, drinking cheap wine, stealing food, and generally showing every indication that his life may be measured only in terms of when he can get next that next drink. And then they meet.  As I was watching, I guessed that Alex and Michelle would somehow connect, that they would prop each other up in mutual support. And it is precisely here that Director Carax goes seriously astray.  If his intent were to present the morally uplifting story of two homeless rejects in the context of an artful exploration of love, needs, and values, then his message goes astray in the criminal activities of both Alex and Michelle.  Michelle gets hold of a pistol, visits her former lover, begs him to let her enter his apartment, and when he refuses,she shoots him through the door's peephole. He dies, and she is exultant.  He may have been a rotter for breaking her heart, but society cannot exist when this sort of thing goes unpunished. As gruesome as her crime is, Alex's corruption is far greater.  He learns of her eye disease by reading a series of posters glued prominently through a long winding tunnel leading to the bridge. He chooses not to tell her that an eye surgeon might cure her. He prefers to keep her dependent on him.  He shows his true needy and controlling nature by striking her on several occasions.  He ultimately refuses to accept her decision to leave him, thereby re-enacting the same scenario that caused her to kill her lover in the first place.  He grabs her and both fall into the river in an attempt that can only be considered as a potential murder-suicide. And this is after his earlier torching of a man whose only crime has been to glue those posters of her eye disease onto Paris walls.It was difficult for me to see these lovers in the positive light that Carax surely intended.  Much of the film involves incredible use of sight and sound that elevates Alex and Michelle to the status of Romeo and Juliet.  He the acrobat, she the artist. As the eye is dazzled by a masterly use of firework pyrotechnics and the ear is deceived by the superficial mutual protestations of love, the critical faculties of the viewer that ought to form the moral center of any audience is tempted to overlook the clearly criminal tendencies of two people who care not a fig for the deaths of others, nor for each other, nor for themselves. By the film's end, I simply could not accept their reconciliation of a happy ending.In movies like this, I would have vastly preferred to see the protagonists come to recognize the consequences of their actions as they ponder where they came from before they can so blithely find solace in an ending that suggests that the only conclusion to a romance based on disease and loathing must result in no hard-won self-awareness at all.",5,The Lovers on the Bridge: The Crushing of Hope,1023580800,"06 9, 2002",2002,3502,"['LOVERS', 'ON', 'THE', 'BRIDGE', 'confusing', 'movie', 'Director', 'Leos', 'Carax', 'clearly', 'audience', 'sympathise', 'plight', 'two', 'stars', 'Alex', 'played', 'Denis', 'Lavant', 'Michelle', 'Juliette', 'Binoche', 'film', 'viewer', 'Alex', 'Michele', 'suffer', 'ego-shattering', 'crises', 'case', 'eye', 'disease', 'gradually', 'worsening', 'state', 'total', 'loss', 'vision', 'just', 'been', 'dumped', 'lover', 'Totally', 'bereft', 'hope', 'small', 'army', 'homeless', 'who', 'live', 'Paris', 'Pont-Neuf', 'Bridge', 'Alex', 'suffers', 'too', 'Carax', 'not', 'inform', 'audience', 'why', 'degenerated', 'physically', 'mentally', 'streets', 'bridge', 'drinking', 'cheap', 'wine', 'stealing', 'food', 'generally', 'showing', 'indication', 'life', 'may', 'be', 'measured', 'only', 'terms', 'when', 'can', 'get', 'next', 'next', 'drink', 'then', 'meet', 'was', 'watching', 'guessed', 'Alex', 'Michelle', 'would', 'somehow', 'connect', 'would', 'prop', 'other', 'up', 'mutual', 'support', 'precisely', 'here', 'Director', 'Carax', 'seriously', 'astray', 'intent', 'were', 'present', 'morally', 'uplifting', 'story', 'two', 'homeless', 'rejects', 'context', 'artful', 'exploration', 'love', 'needs', 'values', 'then', 'message', 'astray', 'criminal', 'activities', 'Alex', 'Michelle', 'Michelle', 'hold', 'pistol', 'former', 'lover', 'let', 'enter', 'apartment', 'when', 'shoots', 'door', 'peephole', 'exultant', 'may', 'have', 'been', 'rotter', 'breaking', 'heart', 'society', 'can', 'not', 'exist', 'when', 'sort', 'thing', 'unpunished', 'As', 'gruesome', 'crime', 'Alex', 'corruption', 'far', 'greater', 'eye', 'disease', 'reading', 'series', 'posters', 'glued', 'prominently', 'long', 'winding', 'tunnel', 'leading', 'bridge', 'not', 'tell', 'eye', 'surgeon', 'might', 'cure', 'keep', 'dependent', 'true', 'needy', 'controlling', 'nature', 'striking', 'several', 'occasions', 'ultimately', 'accept', 'decision', 'leave', 'thereby', 're-enacting', 'same', 'scenario', 'caused', 'kill', 'lover', 'first', 'place', 'grabs', 'fall', 'river', 'attempt', 'can', 'only', 'be', 'considered', 'potential', 'murder-suicide', 'earlier', 'torching', 'man', 'only', 'crime', 'been', 'glue', 'posters', 'eye', 'disease', 'Paris', 'walls.It', 'was', 'difficult', 'see', 'lovers', 'positive', 'light', 'Carax', 'surely', 'intended', 'Much', 'film', 'incredible', 'use', 'sight', 'sound', 'Alex', 'Michelle', 'status', 'Romeo', 'Juliet', 'acrobat', 'artist', 'eye', 'dazzled', 'masterly', 'use', 'firework', 'pyrotechnics', 'ear', 'deceived', 'superficial', 'mutual', 'protestations', 'love', 'critical', 'faculties', 'viewer', 'ought', 'form', 'moral', 'center', 'audience', 'tempted', 'overlook', 'clearly', 'criminal', 'tendencies', 'two', 'people', 'who', 'care', 'not', 'fig', 'deaths', 'others', 'other', 'film', 'end', 'simply', 'could', 'not', 'accept', 'reconciliation', 'happy', 'ending.In', 'movies', 'would', 'have', 'vastly', 'preferred', 'see', 'protagonists', 'come', 'recognize', 'consequences', 'actions', 'ponder', 'where', 'came', 'can', 'so', 'blithely', 'find', 'solace', 'ending', 'only', 'conclusion', 'romance', 'based', 'disease', 'loathing', 'must', 'result', 'hard-won', 'self-awareness']",The Lovers on the Bridge VHS

However, I bought the DVD from Amazon UK several years ago and it is well worth owning.Following Boy Meets Girl (very good) and Mauvais Sang (wonderful,) the followup to Lovers on the Bridge which was Pola X was staggeringly disappointing and undiciplined.
