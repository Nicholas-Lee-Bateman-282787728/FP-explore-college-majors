Christian Slater is wonderful as the &#34;prince charming&#34; all women look for at one time or another.  However, this movie is only 87 minutes long and the movie trailer, as well as some fan-made videos on YouTube show scenes that are not in this move.  I would love for this move to go on and on, but the meager 87 minutes seem to be chopped and left me feeling like something was missing.

Carpenter ""loveclassicmovies""","[3, 4]","I watched &quot;Bed Of Roses&quot; quite some time ago and didn't run across it again until recently when I was watching &quot;Untamed Heart&quot; which also starred Christian Slater in it. &quot;Bed Of Roses&quot; was a sweet movie. It seems a bit unrealistic that a person (Louis) would be walking at night and look up and see a woman crying (Lisa) and then send her flowers, but why not? Isn't anything possible? It certainly made for a wonderful movie and meeting of the two main characters later, when Lisa goes looking to see who sent the flowers. I thought the movie could have delved into Lisa and Louis's characters more and that Mary Stewart Masterson could have gave a less cardboardish performance, but over all I really liked this movie. I like a romance that doesn't &quot;hit you over the head&quot; with the meaning of the story, but one that is subtle. Also look for some classic &quot;funny momnents&quot; like the morning after Louis and Lisa's first night together where he is going on about breakfast foods and getting her toothpaste and her own robe!!!! Very comical! I would say, if you like a good romance and you like a movie that is meant just for the two people, without a lot of other story line situations getting in the way, this is for you!!!",4,A Romance As Sweet as Flowers...,1081814400,"04 13, 2004",2004,1273,"['watched', 'quot', 'Bed', 'Roses', 'quot', 'time', 'ago', 'did', ""n't"", 'run', 'again', 'recently', 'when', 'was', 'watching', 'quot', 'Untamed', 'Heart', 'quot', 'also', 'starred', 'Christian', 'Slater', 'quot', 'Bed', 'Roses', 'quot', 'was', 'sweet', 'movie', 'bit', 'unrealistic', 'person', 'Louis', 'would', 'be', 'walking', 'night', 'look', 'up', 'see', 'woman', 'crying', 'Lisa', 'then', 'send', 'flowers', 'why', 'not', ""n't"", 'anything', 'possible', 'certainly', 'made', 'wonderful', 'movie', 'meeting', 'two', 'main', 'characters', 'later', 'when', 'Lisa', 'looking', 'see', 'who', 'sent', 'flowers', 'thought', 'movie', 'could', 'have', 'delved', 'Lisa', 'Louis', 'characters', 'more', 'Mary', 'Stewart', 'Masterson', 'could', 'have', 'gave', 'less', 'cardboardish', 'performance', 'really', 'liked', 'movie', 'like', 'romance', ""n't"", 'quot', 'hit', 'head', 'quot', 'meaning', 'story', 'one', 'subtle', 'Also', 'look', 'classic', 'quot', 'funny', 'momnents', 'quot', 'morning', 'Louis', 'Lisa', 'first', 'night', 'together', 'where', 'going', 'breakfast', 'foods', 'getting', 'toothpaste', 'own', 'robe', 'Very', 'comical', 'would', 'say', 'like', 'good', 'romance', 'like', 'movie', 'meant', 'just', 'two', 'people', 'lot', 'other', 'story', 'line', 'situations', 'getting', 'way']",Bed of Roses VHS

Both main actors do a pretty good and convincing job, and there seems to be a decent amount of chemistry between them. There are a couple of disturbing things about the movie. The first is the fact that Slater's character is bascially introduced as a clingy, stalker-like person who Masterson's character goes out with after only a minimum of concern. The other thing is that she kisses him early and often which seems a little out of place. Other than these two little issues, this is about what you expect out of a romantic movie.

Slater plays a man who runs a flower shop, and he chooses to take the job of delivering flower orders all day long.  One day he crosses paths with a beautiful young woman (Masterson), and he invites he to join him on his rounds.  Against her basic instincts, she accepts and sees the joy that Slater gains from being the bearer of flowers.Of course they continue to see each other, but as the story and characters continue to develop, we learn that each of them is bearing an unseen burden.  These are burdens that they are unwilling to share, and perhaps even willing to acknowledge.  The question is whether they can overcome those challenges and have a relationship that survives.The acting is good, and I have to admit that I like both lead actors, and they make a good screen match.

Christian Slater and Mary Stuart Masterson were born to play Lewis and Lisa. There's nothing fake about this story. What's so appealing is that this story could happen to anybody. It's about a flower shop owner named Lewis Farrell(played by Slater) who while on one of his nightly walks comes upon a woman standing at her window crying. Feeling sorry for her he follows her to work the next morning and finds out her name is Lisa Walker(played by Masterson).So he pretends to be a delivery boy delivering her flowers. He leaves the card blank because he doesn't want her to know it was him who sent her the flowers. Wanting to know who sent them, Lisa looks on the card and sees where they came from. So she goes to the shop the next day and asks to speak with the person who delivered the flowers. They tell her where to find Lewis, and she goes to talk to him. Well Lewis refuses to tell her who bought them. So she walks away from him, and the next morning he sees her outside the flower shop. He invites her to breakfast and he finally reveals to her that it was he who bought them. Well they start seeing each other,but what Lewis doesn't know is that Lisa has a secret from her past that has left her scard,and afraid to let anyone get close to her. What Lisa doesn't know is that Lewis has a secret of his own. Lisa finds herself falling hopelessly in love with him, but she has built a invisable wall between herself and her emotions because she feels she is unworthy of recieving his love. So she breaks the relationship off, but she learns that she can't live without him, and that life is all about taking chances, and letting go. So she shows up on his doorstep one day with his favorite flowers, and asks him to take her back. As the movie ends and the picture fades you see them in each others arms.

I give it one star for the presence of Mary Stuart Masterson, whom I've always liked. But it never gets past the leaden load of sentimentality that weighs it down throughout. Slater's character is a nice (if rather obsessive) guy, and Masterson's Lisa Walker is a bland professional, and, of course, they (eventually) fall in love without much thrown in their way beyond some mournful navelgazing in the latter third of the flick.What really kills this story is the lack of any real conflict; the writer likes the characters way too much, so nothing very interesting happens to them. It's the Village of the Nice, Lonely People. I would have liked it better if Walker's world-weary, not-very-quirky &quot;quirky single friend&quot; (I can't even remember her name) was the one who actually sent the flowers, because she was secretly in love with Walker, who doesn't even realize it. Then there'd at least be a bizarre love triangle to add some interest, between Friend and Slater and Masterson.As good an example as any for why movies should have strong conflicts and strong characters, instead of wishy-washy blandness soaked in syrupy sentimentality.

The movie was badly miscast. Neither of the romantic leads seemed believable or convincing. In my opinion, it was a couple that just didn't work and they were placed in a story that was difficult to believe. Slater played the role of a florist and sometime stalker who spotted Masterson in a third-floor window of an apartment building at night, tracked her down and then delivered her a large and beautiful bouquet of flowers at her place of work. Of course, he left no name tag. Masterson, a career businesswoman and the stalkee, then backtracked the flowers and the two finally met. Come on now, you expect us to believe this romantic nonsense? Well, if you do, the stalker and stalkee then became an uneasy on-again off-again couple for the rest of the show with them ending up together. Not much of a story. Unbelievable and uninteresting.

398635,A1POFVVXUZR3IQ,6304056745,Z Hayes,"[2, 2]","""Bed of Roses"" is one of my all-time favorite romance dramas - it is subtle, bittersweet and poignant, a story about two people who despite different backgrounds and approaches to life, find that they are true soulmates after all. Mary Stuart Masterson gives a finely nuanced performance as Lisa,an emotionally crippled woman who finds it difficult to establish real relationships with people because of the emotional scarring experienced in her childhood. She is focused only on making her mark professionally, and seems quite content with life...that is until, Lewis [Christian Slater] comes into her life. A yuppie turned florist, Lewis beguiles and confuses Lisa with his attentions and sensitivity. This is a guy who sends her flowers just because he felt she needed them to cheer her up, a guy who attends children's storytime at the library [not for any perverse reason, but because he truly enjoys it, losing himself in the wonder of the story with an almost child-like expression of awe].The closer the pair get, the more perturbed Lisa gets, unsure as to her own emotions with respect to Lewis. Things reach boiling point when Lewis takes Lisa home to meet his family during the holidays, with emotional repercussions for the pair.I felt the theme of emotional healing through true love was subtly portrayed by the two leads who share a credibly on-screen chemistry without being over the top. Nor was it overly sappy - all the elements of this love story was credibly played out and the pacing was just right. I loved the cinematography, especially with the focus on the flowers, the sights and sounds of things around Lewis and Lisa - it beautifully captured the evolving relationship.Though this never did hit it big at the box-office, it is nevertheless a well-done romance drama that has always managed to tug at my heartstrings, and I've watched it many times over the years.
