304382,AK6UVFSU07NXH,6302259096,Anthony Hinde,"[139, 141]","Despite being less well known, &quot;Regarding Henry&quot; is one of Harrison Ford's best works. The film demands a wide spectrum from this great actor and he delivers convincingly. For the most part, the other performers take their cue from Ford's &quot;Henry&quot; and render a near perfect glimpse of a life that could have been.The tile character, Henry Turner, is  introduced to us as a top-flight litigator for a large New York legal firm. He is well groomed, dressed in a designer suit and he is seen speaking sincerely to a jury about human desires and justice. Our opinion of him changes as soon as Henry leaves the court. He quickly makes a call to his interior designer to berate her for having the wrong table delivered to his palatial home. He is just another lawyer, after all.It is hard to watch this movie at the start. Henry is one of those men we all love to hate. He is selfish, self centered, successful and confident. His daughter is frightened of him and his wife is a pale reflection of him. Luckily we are not forced to watch this Henry for very long. He makes the classic movie exit and &quot;goes out for some cigarettes.&quot;What follows is a scene that is perfectly directed. Henry walks into a corner store demanding his brand of cigarettes, unaware that the other patron is robbing the owner. Henry does not become scared but before he can even attempt to control the situation, he is lying on the sidewalk with two bullets inside his body and the wail of  approaching sirens in the background. This event is the cusp of Henry's life.Annette Bening plays Henry's Wife, Sarah. She may not be in love with her husband anymore but she needs him. As her financial position becomes clear, she realizes she needs him very much. But she is not unaffected by it all. This is the man in her life, the father of her child, a good provider and protector. Seeing him lying motionless in a hospital bed, drooling and staring vacantly, is probably the most painful thing she has ever experienced. But there is some hope of recovery.Henry's long rejuvenation at a specialty medical center is like a rebirth. He remembers nothing, coming into his new world without the power  of speech or the ability to walk. His midwife/physiotherapist, Bradley, is wonderful. He is full of life, energy and enthusiasm. As Henry is taught to walk and speak and function, Bradely becomes the mainstay of his life. Sarah keeps her distance and Henry doesn't get to see his daughter, (Rachel), at all until the day he is deemed fit to go home, a scary separation from the only people he trusts.But the Henry that returns to a home he barely remembers, is not the same man that left for cigarettes. He is a little shy, very calm, forgiving, gentle and above all, nice. His transformation is interpreted in different ways by different groups. The movie serves as an interesting depiction of how society views disabilities. His boss is patronizing, his daughter delighted, his mistress is distraught and for the longest time, Sarah doesn't know what to feel.The ending may be predictable but in this case, it is the journey that we love. Most of us feel we have lost our innocence and that our honor has been a little tarnished by life's decisions. Henry takes us on a trip to see what might happen if we surrendered all the hard won prizes in our life and instead, chose to embrace life itself. This is a film that will make you feel. Some days, that's just what we need.",5,Sometimes the worst curse is your truest blessing,1003622400,"10 21, 2001",2001,3466,"['being', 'less', 'well', 'known', 'quot', 'Regarding', 'Henry', 'quot', 'one', 'Harrison', 'Ford', 'best', 'works', 'film', 'wide', 'spectrum', 'great', 'actor', 'convincingly', 'most', 'part', 'other', 'performers', 'take', 'cue', 'Ford', 'quot', 'Henry', 'quot', 'render', 'near', 'perfect', 'glimpse', 'life', 'could', 'have', 'been.The', 'tile', 'character', 'Henry', 'Turner', 'introduced', 'top-flight', 'litigator', 'large', 'New', 'York', 'legal', 'firm', 'well', 'groomed', 'dressed', 'designer', 'suit', 'seen', 'speaking', 'sincerely', 'jury', 'human', 'desires', 'justice', 'opinion', 'changes', 'as', 'soon', 'Henry', 'court', 'quickly', 'call', 'interior', 'designer', 'berate', 'having', 'wrong', 'table', 'delivered', 'palatial', 'home', 'just', 'lawyer', 'all.It', 'hard', 'watch', 'movie', 'start', 'Henry', 'one', 'men', 'love', 'hate', 'selfish', 'centered', 'successful', 'confident', 'daughter', 'frightened', 'wife', 'pale', 'reflection', 'Luckily', 'are', 'not', 'forced', 'watch', 'Henry', 'very', 'long', 'classic', 'movie', 'exit', 'quot', 'out', 'cigarettes.', 'quot', 'What', 'scene', 'perfectly', 'directed', 'Henry', 'corner', 'store', 'demanding', 'brand', 'cigarettes', 'unaware', 'other', 'patron', 'robbing', 'owner', 'Henry', 'not', 'become', 'scared', 'can', 'even', 'attempt', 'control', 'situation', 'lying', 'sidewalk', 'two', 'bullets', 'body', 'wail', 'approaching', 'sirens', 'background', 'event', 'cusp', 'Henry', 'life.Annette', 'Bening', 'Henry', 'Wife', 'Sarah', 'may', 'not', 'be', 'love', 'husband', 'anymore', 'financial', 'position', 'becomes', 'clear', 'very', 'much', 'not', 'unaffected', 'man', 'life', 'father', 'child', 'good', 'provider', 'protector', 'Seeing', 'lying', 'motionless', 'hospital', 'bed', 'drooling', 'staring', 'vacantly', 'probably', 'most', 'painful', 'thing', 'ever', 'experienced', 'hope', 'recovery.Henry', 'long', 'rejuvenation', 'specialty', 'medical', 'center', 'rebirth', 'nothing', 'coming', 'new', 'world', 'power', 'speech', 'ability', 'walk', 'midwife/physiotherapist', 'Bradley', 'wonderful', 'full', 'life', 'energy', 'enthusiasm', 'Henry', 'taught', 'walk', 'speak', 'function', 'Bradely', 'mainstay', 'life', 'Sarah', 'distance', 'Henry', ""n't"", 'get', 'see', 'daughter', 'Rachel', 'day', 'deemed', 'fit', 'go', 'home', 'scary', 'separation', 'only', 'people', 'Henry', 'home', 'barely', 'remembers', 'not', 'same', 'man', 'left', 'cigarettes', 'little', 'shy', 'very', 'calm', 'forgiving', 'gentle', 'nice', 'transformation', 'interpreted', 'different', 'ways', 'different', 'groups', 'movie', 'interesting', 'depiction', 'how', 'society', 'views', 'disabilities', 'boss', 'patronizing', 'daughter', 'delighted', 'mistress', 'distraught', 'longest', 'time', 'Sarah', ""n't"", 'know', 'what', 'feel.The', 'ending', 'may', 'be', 'predictable', 'case', 'journey', 'love', 'Most', 'feel', 'have', 'lost', 'innocence', 'honor', 'been', 'little', 'tarnished', 'life', 'decisions', 'Henry', 'trip', 'see', 'what', 'might', 'happen', 'surrendered', 'hard', 'won', 'prizes', 'life', 'instead', 'chose', 'embrace', 'life', 'film', 'will', 'make', 'feel', 'days', 'just', 'what', 'need']",Regarding Henry VHS

To be honest, I really can't remember what those scenes where! Weird?Anyway, I've seen it a few times now as an adult and I get a whole new emotion from this. ""Sometimes you have to hit bottom in order to reach the top once again"". This is what has happened in this movie. Harrison Ford's character was a cold and arrogant Lawyer that didn't care for anything or anyone unless it gave him financial gain in some form. He and his wife had many friends who later in the movie they discover how ""true"" those friends are. It's a sad moment in the movie that many of us have or (heaven forbid) will have experienced in our lives...heaven knows that I have.After his accident he changes into another man who is compassionate, thankful and most importantly, humbled. Something of which most of his 'said' friends are not. They're uncomfortable with the change so they do what they do best. They judge, mock...whatever you feel fits. One of my favorite scenes is when Henry goes to one of his old client's apartment and he appoligizes for what he did during one of the cases. That in itself is amazing because he honestly didn't remember doing the work. Of course he finds out after reading some of his cases.Some people here may not like the movie because of what it represents. I on another hand look at it more of a positive way and I've found that this is one of the best movies they've made.Judge the movie for yourself.

MacNeil ""Chris M""","[9, 11]","This atypical Harrison Ford-Annette Bening outing is one of those guilty pleasures that critics who deride it won't fess up to its feel-good result. We see Ford first as an ethic-skirting attorney whose sense of justice apparently doesn't extend beyond how the letter of the law can be manipulated to ""win"" at the cost of ""human"" justice. Of course, the film's premise that a gunshot wound to the head, which is what happens to Ford's character of Henry Turner, can create a neurological about-face in character is ridiculous. But we don't care. It's plain fun and reassuring to see Henry go from an amoral, apparently unfeeling big shot to a family man seeking to fit into his new world. Ford carries this film all the way and proves he can unleash an emotional performance, something most of his film characters aren't required to do.

All parties on the acting front put out good work here.BUT coming back to this film after the brain injury of my daughter, I did view it through different eyes and it was, somehow, helpful to me at that time.  The doctors said she would undergo a ""personality shift"" which we were all fearful of.

The only people who truly care about and love Henry before his accident are his wife and daughter; he spends his time with everyone else. They are also the only ones who care about and love Henry after his accident, when his formerly ""faithful"" business colleagues abandon him - his cold-blooded instincts and machiavellian legal talents having been destroyed by his accident (brain anoxia due to a damaged subclavian artery). As in Dustin Hoffman's Rainman and Tom Hanks' Forrest Gump, there is humor and much innocence. Innocence is moving when its vehicle is an adult rather than a child: It's rarer.But there *is* one other character who cares about and loves Henry: His earthy, streetsmart physical therapist Bradley, who patiently and lovingly teaches Henry to walk, talk, and even think again. On their daily strolls around the sanitarium where Henry is recuperating gradually, Bradley always ogles the cute young nurses, constantly telling the still-mute and barely-able-to-walk Henry, ""I gotta get me some o' that!"" Later, it becomes My Fair Lady in reverse when, after several weeks of this operant conditioning, a cute young nurse jogs past the two of them and Henry very innocently mumbles to Bradley, ""Yeah, you gotta get you some o' that"". But make no mistake, Bradley has a heart of gold, he enhances this film with his infectious joie-de-vivre, and his humanity saves Henry.

Henry Turner is a very hard man to like in the beginning of this movie, and so is his wife. As a result of walking into a seemingly random accident, (""going out for cigarettes,"" it seems smoking means nothing but a bad person anymore) Henry begins a long and arduous recovery process from a brain injury. Along the way to finding out what he once was, he finds that what he once was is something he no longer cares to be. Watching his wife, his daughter, his colleagues, friends, and even his beagle dog along the way is something pretty special to see as Henry moves along to deal with all the circumstances in his life that he previously sought to ignore.

I think Henry is all about hope and change for the better. This is a good movie that is not one of the best, but one that you remember long after having viewed it.

Harrison Ford is great as one of his most likeable characters that I have seen him portray.  Henry, a corrupt lawyer who withholds evidence when his client is obviously guilty and a womanizer is seriously injured in a robbery.  When he comes to, he has lost his memory and has to be re-taught just about everything.  His teacher is a very virtuous man, who teaches Henry to enjoy the good things in life (Henry loves most of all Ritz crackers).  Thus the mean, cheating Henry who forced his daughter to remain at a boarding school that she hates, is suddenly transformed into a kind man who cares about everybody's feelings.Eventually, he figures out that the Henry he once was was a horrible person and he hopes never to go back to that life.Annette Benning is great and beautiful as the wife that had an uncaring husband who all of a sudden loves her more than anything.

He becomes fearless and fun-loving and must face the  person he used to be as he realizes that even though he has changed, others  are treating him like the old, spiteful Henry.

Then I saw it, and liked it very much. Of course it is sentimental and manipulative, but all films are manipulative. I liked Harrison's work, and I even liked Annette Bening, which does not always happen for me. Most of us wonder whether, if we suffered a serious brain injury or a spinal cord break, if we would survive, and cope. This film shows one fictional guy facing that crisis, and becoming a better man for having lost some of his mental toughness and job skills. Those who sneer at this touching film perhaps have already lost the humane sense that Harrison Ford's character acquires through suffering.",4,"Much better than its reputation, if you have a heart...",1159833600,"10 3, 2006",2006,745,"['recall', 'most', 'critics', 'trashing', 'film', '15', 'years', 'ago', 'when', 'was', 'new', 'heard', 'especially', 'vicious', 'critique', 'NPR', 'places', 'Then', 'saw', 'liked', 'very', 'much', 'course', 'sentimental', 'manipulative', 'films', 'are', 'manipulative', 'liked', 'Harrison', 'work', 'even', 'liked', 'Annette', 'Bening', 'not', 'always', 'happen', 'Most', 'wonder', 'suffered', 'serious', 'brain', 'injury', 'spinal', 'cord', 'break', 'would', 'survive', 'cope', 'film', 'one', 'fictional', 'guy', 'facing', 'crisis', 'becoming', 'better', 'man', 'having', 'lost', 'mental', 'toughness', 'job', 'skills', 'who', 'sneer', 'touching', 'film', 'perhaps', 'have', 'already', 'lost', 'humane', 'sense', 'Harrison', 'Ford', 'character', 'suffering']",Regarding Henry VHS

304452,AP3B615GM191G,6302259096,"Zachary Koenig ""K-Dawg""","[0, 0]","""Regarding Henry"" is a simple movie.  It doesn't contain any explosions, tense/scary moments, or blockbuster action scenes.  In fact, one might say that the movie doesn't really have any ""action"" at all.  What it does contain, however, is healthy doses of terrific acting and great storytelling, which make it an entertaining experience from beginning to end.For a basic plot summary, ""Regarding Henry"" tells the story of Henry Turner (Harrison Ford), a suave, cocky lawyer who doesn't have much time for wife Sarah (Annette Bening) or daughter Rachel (Mikki Allen).  After being shot in a drugstore mugging, however, Henry is forced to essentially re-learn life again via physical and mental therapy.  The person that emerges turns out to be quite different from the ""original"" Henry.If you need one concrete reason to watch this movie, the acting from Ford would be it!  His facial expressions and gestures perfectly fit this movie and are much-needed in a film experience that rely so much on the ""little things"".The main storyline of the film--written by rookie screenwriter Jeffrey Abrams...now known the world-over as ""J.J.""!--is also nuanced enough to never get old despite its relatively slow pace.  The story of a man have a re-learn everything about his life is intriguing enough (and in this case just humorous enough as well) to really hold your interest and make you care about what is going on.Overall, ""Regarding Henry"" is a solid cinematic effort that does a lot of things right.
