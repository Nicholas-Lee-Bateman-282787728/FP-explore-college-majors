The entire hour was just hysterical.  I was cracking up, my husband was cracking up, and Charlie Rose was laughing so hard that he had to bang his hand on the table.  During the course of this hour-long interview, they played a clip of Robin Williams, Live on Broadway.  It was the clip about the invention of golf.  I laughed so hard that I had tears in my eyes.  Immediately, I decided that I wanted this DVD.I feel so disappointed.  While there are defintely some very funny things on the DVD (such as the invention of golf bit and the September 11 jokes), so much of what was on there was disgusting potty humor, oral sex jokes, and viagra gags.  It's nasty.  Worse, it is soooo done already.  I really expected more from Robin Williams.  Not only was this material nasty, it was way beneath him.Robin Williams was by far funnier on Charlie Rose Live, just doing stuff off the cuff, then he was in this DVD.  Maybe I'll give away this DVD and try to order a copy of Charlie Rose.If you like nasty humor and never get tired of it, then go ahead and buy this DVD.  Otherwise, maybe just rent or borrow it.

He just sizzles on stage, yelling for two hours, and some people consider it a great comedy. No it is not.

Be warned though - this is definitely for adults only, and I didn't given the movie 5 stars for one simple reason. Williams seems to have a constant need for expletives thoughout the show, to the point of over saturation I felt, and whereas I never felt offended by it, it did begin to grate by the end.

And it was a long wait that was well worth it.Robin's take on the politics and people's self image is very hilarious.  Which some of it is scary, but true!  He even tries to push the limits of what people were finding funny when he starts bashing Osama Bin Laden, but then goes into an ethnic joke right off from it and causes some confusion.  Even the audience's reaction to that is funny.I ordered this DVD twice, once for a friend for Christmas, since she found the special when it was on HBO funny.  Then I ordered it for myself, since I wanted to have it.The only thing I could have wished for was Robin to do a ""commentary"" track over the comedy.  Would have been funny to hear him make fun of himself and to hear his thoughts on what he was making jokes about.The ""extras"" were nice.  The interview was a good thing to have.  But then there was the sound effects and the ""secret"" area.

If you have not seen a Robin Williams stand-up, this may be surprising to you.  I've seen some reviews objecting to the vulgarity.  Well, that's him.  For those who compare his movies to his stand-up, movies are scripted by other people even with his improvisations.  A great example is Bob Saget.  His stand-ups are hilariously vulgar, but he is best known for his fatherly character in Full House and hosting AFV, both of which are more PC.Opinion of Stand-up:Until I lost it (looking to replace it), I owned Robin Williams: Live 2002.  It's a 2 disk version of this stand-up.  It is a more streamlined version of this stand-up.  If you find this to be a bit too erratic, then you may prefer that version.However, I love this version!  The problem is I know the Live 2002 version so well that I do notice the difference in the jokes.  Some punch lines are better in Live 2002 and some are better in this version.  I do like this one.  And you can tell this one is uncut, which I like.  It is almost like being there instead of just watching something cut for performance.Also, if you watch it now, much of the jokes are based on events of the time like most comedians.

He runs about 200 kilometers per hour for almost two hours without a break.  I am reminded of the manic phase in Manic-Depression.  There is something almost monstrous about his energy.  One can scarcely get bored, because he continually pulls rabbits out of his hat, providing fresh food for thought every second.  If you walk away to fetch a beer, you miss a punchline.  His style has drawbacks, because pacing and timing is essential in order to receive maximum value from a joke.  Knowing how to say your lines is very well, but knowing when to be silent, and for how long, is I believe a higher order of mastery, and is what earned Margaret Cho's first videotaped performance (""I'm the One that I Want"") the perfect five stars (her other offerings proved dismal).  Robin flies off into his own very special world of adrenaline-fueled wit.  There is really no one alive who does this sort of thing better than he does, but he is simply too fast for my complete comfort.  If you watch this, drink a pot of coffee to accelerate your mind, and avoid alcohol.  Despite my criticisms, this performance is well-worth watching.  Robin Williams is one of the funniest human beings alive, is indisputably brilliant, and is a master of improvisation.  Even his mis-steps and memory faults, rare as they are, are transformed into jokes.  His material (mostly penis jokes, I believe) simply was not as good as Margaret Cho's.  Hers had a unity of theme and actually told a story, the story of her life, while Robin's was a series of unrelated gags.  Furthermore Cho provoked other emotional reactions than mirth, such as, occasionally, tenderness and sympathy; she had greater depth.

Zawada,"[146, 152]","Whether it's parading around on stage in a frenzy or breaking out into one of many possible impressions/accents, it simply does not get any better than Robin Williams Live when it comes to gut-wrenching laughs.Williams goes all out in all of his live performances. This particular night he performs live on Broadway (the culmination of a 20+ city national tour, and marking the conclusion of his triumphant, and much-heralded return to the ""stage"" in over 16 years). And what is the verdict??? BRILLIANCE!! The same brand of raunchy, charismatic, no holds-barred, yet very intelligent humor Williams has been known for.ONE THING NEEDS TO BE POINTED OUT: Williams' energy is unparalleled in his stand-up work and is NOTHING like his theatrical roles (from Flubber to Insomnia), which only seem to stifle the madman lurking beneath. With uncensored, and essentially unscripted stand-up, Robin is able to reveal his TRUE SELF. However, this is not some mindless rant... Williams seems to emerge from a shell he's been keeping himself in... commentating on social and political issues of the day (from foreign relations, biological warfare, sex, and even sports).Where this ""movie"" truly earns 5 STARS is in Williams's performance itself. Sadly, comics today go through ""ho-hum"" HBO specials like candy (I will not name names), giving audiences and viewers 60-65 minutes. Williams goes non-stop for 2 hours!! And as a result becomes so drenched in sweat by the end, you begin to wonder how he's still standing!Material-wise, I feel there is no one better, with Williams delivery of quips, jokes, and punchlines only rivaled by George Carlin, and the shows of Eddie Murphy from the early to mid 1980s.The DVD package, as many other DVDs seem to nowadays, comes with more than anyone could have expected, with behind-the-scenes broadcasts, and a full interview with the maestro himself. The picture and sound quality are superb and nothing seems to have been lost in the transfer.Bottomline: though perhaps crude at some points, I think that ANYONE with at least a partially open mind and a love for laughs will enjoy this movie.

Williams is alone on the large stage, his only prop being a small table loaded with bottles of mineral water. He is constantly gulping and spilling water while he sweats profusely. The bottles are used at times very comedically to demonstrate various functions.Williams has a myriad of targets: the haughty French, President Bush, Osama bin Laden, the augmentation of body parts, cats staking out their territory, Viagra, the child molestation scandal involving priests, various churches and denominations, his own hairiness, etc. The list is long. His delivery is rapid-fire, frenetic, and sometimes too hectic and too harrowing. He is trying hard, sometimes working too hard for laughs, but he almost always hits a homer.It's definitely not for the kiddies or for the prudish or linguistically timid. Little is sacred. It's a very visual, animated type of humor which relies on his actions as well as his words. An audio version would not do it justice. He's crude; he's coarse, but not as wild in his use of profanity as George Carlin. He returns to certain themes and riffs with the French coming in for extra jabs.It's a broad type of almost slapstick humor that doesn't seem as satiric as just plain funny.

He lets loose here in a sustained comic bout of Williams-style voice impressions and sharp observations and adult jokes that I've never had the pleasure of witnessing in any of his movies (except, maybe, in small spurts). As a standup comic, he might not as smooth a performer as George Carlin (my personal favorite) is onstage, but Williams' energy makes up for a lot, and even makes otherwise stupid jokes make you laugh hysterically. (You know how you can tell he is expending as much energy as humanly possible in this show? By the huge amount of water bottles he has on stage.) His material is not as focused as some of the best standup comics, but I rather liked his improvisatory style---he goes from one thing to another in record time, giving his performance a nicely chaotic feel. (A lot of his best bits, mostly dealing with politics, are delivered quickly and randomly and then dispensed with.) And yet all of it flows together nicely (even if some bits are inevitably better than others).So what's the problem? I think perhaps 99 minutes or so of one man comically riffing about anything and everything is still perhaps a bit too long for its own good. I've watched this on more than one occasion, and by the hour mark I always feel myself getting rather exhausted by Williams' highly energetic schtick. It is not necessarily that his material starts to become significantly weaker or repetitive (although his French-bashing does get a little tiresome after a while), but while you still marvel at Williams' energy level...I dunno, I just kinda got tired of it on some level after a while. Williams' energy may not flag, but ours does...at least until he rebounds at the end with some good bits about American sports and then about sex, particularly Viagra. Believe me, when you see his take on Viagra, you will laugh hysterically in spite of yourself.In short, for me, ""Robin Williams: Live on Broadway"" is a mostly brilliant but perhaps overlong standup comedy piece (a standup comedy ""epic"" if there ever was one). It would have gotten five stars as a more focused hourlong show; instead, this one sprawls until we in the audience start feeling a little exhausted by his endlessly energetic (and highly profane) style. And yet there is enough brilliant stuff here---his riffs about the war in Afghanistan and homeland security rival the best, and overall there are plenty of small but great bits here and there that will grab your attention---so that this is definitely worth seeing. Certainly you will be amazed that Robin Williams actually pulls the whole damned thing off at all. Recommended.NOTE: I have seen ""Robin Williams: Live on Broadway"" as it first premiered on HBO, and for some reason it is slightly longer than the program that appears on this DVD. It is beyond me why CMV Home Video thought it necessary to make some small cuts to the program for this DVD edition. (For instance, it cuts out a lines during the parts where he cracks humorously about Michael Jackson and the Enron scandal.) At least, though, the program is not significantly cut (it's only missing about a few seconds worth of material from the initial broadcast), and overall it is very much intact. (Besides, HBO and its other channels have been showing this marginally-cut version of the program on its stations ever since, anyway.)

Williams is wild, crazy, and unpredictable... which makes it all that better.""Robin Williams Live on Broadway"" is 126 minutes of pure outrageous comedy like you've never seen before.  You can tell that he doesn't rehearse any of his acts, because he can switch from one topic to the next with ease and without warning.  He is constantly on the move and is never lacking the humor in his act.  I could tell you about the stuff you'll see, but it wouldn't sound funny.  After all, it's really not the content alone that makes this so funny, it's the DELIVERY.  If anybody else attempted to do this material, it wouldn't be funny.This is the exact show that was shown on HBO, unedited and uncensored.  Don't be fooled, Williams loves to curse.  (In fact, there's even a cute little hidden Easter Egg that if you find it, it's like a full-blown case of Turret's Syndrome, Williams style.)  But when he swears, it doesn't sound all that shocking or offensive.  It just comes out natural.  Presented in DVD format, you get a crystal clear picture and your choice of either Dolby Digital 5.1 Surround Sound, or PCM Stereo.  (PCM may not be available on all DVD players.  I've never heard of it before, so be warned.)There's some really cool extras on the DVD, such as an interview with Williams conducted by the director of ""Live on Broadway,"" a behind-the-scenes look before the show, a noises montage, and a really, really offensive and hilarious Easter Egg.""Robin Williams Live on Broadway"" is a great purchase, and is a must-have for all comedy lovers.  I recommend getting this instead of the CD, because the CD isn't as funny if you haven't seen the act.  After all, it's all in the delivery.

Well, in this live on Broadway standup routine (recorded for HBO from the Broadway Theater in New York City) Robin Williams throws whatever morallity he has out the window and enjoys an open mic.Watching this made me laugh until I was crying and suffering abdominal pain.  For those of you expecting ""Flubber"" or ""Hook"" you will be quite suprised that Mr. Williams is extremely dirty and political as he throws controversial jokes straight at the camera.To explain the topics he covers is impossible because he is so fast and is capable of changing subjects so fast that to try to explain what it is about is far beyond my ability.  In fact, he goes so fast, he finishes an entire CASE of water, which is probably about 20 bottles.More specifically, Williams takes advantage of his large talent of character acting and astounds his audiences.  As he jumps back between is French ""Look, I give a cigarette to a baby"" to George Dubya saying ""Our economy is--oh, look at the kitty!""  He is not afraid to offend anyone as he examines religeons like Episcipals, Jews, Christianity, Puritanism, Calvanism, Buddism, Hinduism, and Islam.Because of the fact that this is a DVD, it comes with a few extra features.  First is an interview which is very charming with several chuckles allthe way through.  Also included is a track of noises, which are all of Robin's wacky sound effects that he creates throughout the stand up routine.  For those of you who are always excited to find a secret easter egg, there is also a track called ""Parental Advisory"" that is 2 minutes of all the curses (which are EXTREMELY plentiful) that Robin uses.  The feature is in PCM stereo as well as Dolby Digital 5.1.The Dolby Digital 5.1 surround sound I thought seemed a little weird since at random times you will hear applause behind you and it sounds unnnatural most likely due to bad mixing/editing.I would not, however, recommend any of this DVD for children under the age of 13, depending on how mature your children are.  This probably deserves to be rated R or possibly even NC-17 because of it's extremely naughty language, vulgar topics and sexual content.All-in-all, Robin Williams is absoluletly hilarious, I think this is probably the best stand up routine I've ever seen and is definately worth the price.",5,Absolutely Amazing,1044835200,"02 10, 2003",2003,2424,"['Excellent', 'excellent', 'excellent', 'Many', 'associate', 'Robin', 'Williams', 'funny', 'didactic', 'movies', 'always', 'end', 'moral', 'value', 'Well', 'live', 'Broadway', 'standup', 'routine', 'recorded', 'HBO', 'Broadway', 'Theater', 'New', 'York', 'City', 'Robin', 'Williams', 'morallity', 'out', 'window', 'open', 'mic.Watching', 'made', 'was', 'crying', 'suffering', 'abdominal', 'pain', 'expecting', 'Flubber', 'Hook', 'will', 'be', 'quite', 'suprised', 'Mr.', 'Williams', 'extremely', 'dirty', 'political', 'controversial', 'jokes', 'straight', 'camera.To', 'explain', 'topics', 'impossible', 'so', 'fast', 'capable', 'changing', 'subjects', 'so', 'fast', 'try', 'explain', 'what', 'about', 'far', 'ability', 'fact', 'so', 'fast', 'entire', 'CASE', 'water', 'probably', '20', 'bottles.More', 'specifically', 'Williams', 'advantage', 'large', 'talent', 'character', 'acting', 'audiences', 'back', 'French', 'Look', 'give', 'cigarette', 'baby', 'George', 'Dubya', 'saying', 'economy', 'oh', 'look', 'kitty', 'not', 'afraid', 'offend', 'anyone', 'religeons', 'Episcipals', 'Jews', 'Christianity', 'Puritanism', 'Calvanism', 'Buddism', 'Hinduism', 'Islam.Because', 'fact', 'DVD', 'few', 'extra', 'features', 'First', 'interview', 'very', 'charming', 'several', 'chuckles', 'allthe', 'way', 'Also', 'included', 'track', 'noises', 'are', 'Robin', 'wacky', 'sound', 'effects', 'stand', 'up', 'routine', 'who', 'are', 'always', 'excited', 'find', 'secret', 'easter', 'egg', 'also', 'track', 'called', 'Parental', 'Advisory', '2', 'minutes', 'curses', 'are', 'EXTREMELY', 'plentiful', 'Robin', 'feature', 'PCM', 'stereo', 'as', 'well', 'Dolby', 'Digital', '5.1.The', 'Dolby', 'Digital', '5.1', 'surround', 'sound', 'thought', 'seemed', 'little', 'weird', 'random', 'times', 'will', 'hear', 'unnnatural', 'most', 'likely', 'due', 'bad', 'mixing/editing.I', 'would', 'not', 'however', 'recommend', 'DVD', 'children', 'age', '13', 'depending', 'how', 'mature', 'children', 'are', 'probably', 'be', 'rated', 'R', 'possibly', 'even', 'NC-17', 'extremely', 'naughty', 'language', 'vulgar', 'topics', 'sexual', 'content.All-in-all', 'Robin', 'Williams', 'absoluletly', 'hilarious', 'think', 'probably', 'best', 'stand', 'up', 'routine', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'seen', 'definately', 'worth', 'price']",Robin Williams: Live On Broadway

""Live on Broadway"" shows an artist attempting to rediscover his rhythms and delivery after being away from the stage since the Reagan Administration.

His legendary quick stream-of- conscious delivery clicks in and he transforms himself into an amazing variety of characters - a French ice-skating judge, German doctors, Scottish golfers, Jamaican bong-smokers, and Donald Rumsfeld.

Robin Williams is a comic genius, but this is not his best work. It is definitely worth viewing and will get many laughs, but some of the spark is gone (no, not the drug-induced sparks either).

Burney,"[39, 40]","I first saw the tail end of Robin's Broadway show on HBO and laughed till I was crying, and I was absolutely thrilled when they put his show on DVD. It is an excellent purchase if you enjoy Williams' quirky, loud, and animated humor.His show, which runs over two hours and has very, very few parts that aren't funny, captures the full range of his comic abilities. You get to see Robin impersonate a monkey, a sexually frustrated ape, a little boy, George Bush, an Afghan trying to call a jihad with a mouth full of peanut butter, a drunken Scotsman, a stoner, a drunkard, and a patient recovering from a colonoscopy. His talent for improvising is obvious a few times throughout the show, most notably when he trips over his own tongue and still manages to turn his bungled words into a hysterical joke.Aside from the show--which any Robin Williams or comedy fan will enjoy--the DVD contains a few amusing extras, most notably a special feature called ""noises."" This tidbit captures all of the various noises that Robin makes throughout his two hour show and condenses them into about five minutes. Needless to say, this is the funniest thing on the DVD.Also included is an interview with the director of the show. This has its funny moments and sheds some interesting light onto how the show was produced (it actually didn't start out how it was intended to), and gives us a glimpse of Robin off the stage, but it is cut short, making it a relatively boring special feature after you've seen it once (""noises,"" on the contrary, can be viewed indefinitely).The producers of the DVD also included a five minute clip of Robin cracking jokes in the minutes before he was to go onstage. It gives us another glimpse of just how funny he can be without rehearsed jokes, but it falls short of greatness and can only be viewed once or twice.In short, if you enjoy the energetic style of comedy that Robin Williams exudes, or if you just want to laugh out loud about the absurdity of contemporary events, don't hesitate to add this to your collection. For a more intellectual and original show, however, I highly recommend Eddie Izzard's ""Dress To Kill.""

Geez, everyone's talking about reality TV getting out of control, and they're right, but this tidal wave of stand up comics that aren't funny in the least is getting to me more.It's okay though, because there is a solution to all this madness that so many are confused by, and it's this DVD.  Robin Williams returns from his mission of playing serious roles in Good Will Hunting, Insomnia and One Hour Photo to show that he's still the same funny guy that had us rolling on the ground years earlier in Good Morning Vietnam and Mrs. Doubtfire.What makes this DVD so hilarious is Williams just will not let up.  He barely pauses to take a breath.  Joke after joke after joke come out, each one funnier than the last, not giving you any time to recover for the next joke.  Even when he screws up (which he actually does quite often) he's ready with another joke to cover up what he just messed up on.  Williams is brilliant, with writing and with improvisation, and he balances both quite well.From jokes about cat territoriality to Osama Bin Laden to Gandhi jeans, Williams proves to be the funniest man alive...again.  I can honestly say I have never laughed harder in my entire life as I did when I watched Robin Williams Live On Broadway for the first time.Almost two hours of pure hilarity?

It's been so long that you might wonder if he can compete with the current market, a market saturated with riffers and comedy hacks on every channel of every hour of every day.Suffice it to say, Williams has been taking keen notes and has spent a LOT of time in his bathroom mirror.  The magic of the set lies in its incredible length, his intensity sustained over said length, the audacity of doing the entire thing as a live broadcast, and the pure comedy of his observations.  This man infuses a minute of material with more references and force of caricature than even Dennis Miller...no stranger to the dense and witty monologue.  Williams remains accessible, fresh and pounds the stage with his presence.  Personally, I found the material better than anything he's ever done, and his chops are not only razor-sharp, but his own.  There's a lot of comedians out there covering the same material (and a lot of them the same, dry way), but nobody is raking Michael Jackson, American bedroom foibles and Scottish people over the coals quite like Williams.A couple of special sidenotes for anyone out there tired of contemporary comedy albums of late:1) It's long, so you get BIG bang for your buck, especially at the speed of which he delivers.  If he spoke at the monotonic rate of the average Comedy Central comedian this would be a four hour set, so you get a lot of jokes in a lot of time.Also, because of the length and density of the material, this set has great replay value.2) There are no songs parodies or muscial selections.
