183714,A1MR1VMK999I6O,1564082288,"Beth DeRoos ""Beth DeRoos from the California ...","[18, 20]","What I liked about the movie was the believable non preachy story lines.  Like with the one young couple where the woman Cheryl Martin is a Christian but isn't walking the talk, who then finds she has made a poor choice and faces some hard choices. Meanwhile the man Derrick Williams is struggling with his bitterness from not having a Dad growing up, and his goal of showing the Dad he never knew that he is better than him.Meanwhile the other climber Michael Harris, is a widower, who is also a Christian, although not an in your face type which I found very refreshing.  He seeks God first and listens and in doing so avoids mistakes the other climber is making.  But he never gives up on his friend whom he sees as a hurting man.  He simply loves him where he is at, which is what Christ does with each of us.  In the end he brings the Biblical admonition of laying down our life for a friend to life.Mack 'Mackie' Leonard is the owner of a sporting goods store whose son the climbers have saved so he promises to fund their big climb and has promised to build a new store in an area where businesses are needed.  A man who works for him tries to go behind his back to change things, and gets fired for being corrupt.  I like the whole story line.I also loved the cinematography since we are a backpacking, skiing, climbing family and never get tired of great mountain scenes.  Sure, some elements of the movie may seem sappy to hardened movie goers.  But for me I simply liked the story line and how in an era when so many 'Christian' movies like the Left Behind Series are so sophomoric, that this movie is mature and well thought out.On a side note, I so appreciated seeing a black man in a serious climbing movie, because climbing and most snow sports are often shown as being activities that only whites do.

183716,A3P876I6K3KL8V,1564082288,C. Long,"[1, 1]","This movie from Worldwide Pictures (the movie arm of the BGEA - Billy Graham Evangelistic Association) is a GREAT movie and definitely recommended! I was hesitant before even watching the film because there was another movie put out by the BGEA around the same time that I thought was a bit ""hokey"", overly predicatable, and superficial. So I was half-expecting to see similar with this film. But I am happy to report that I didn't!This movie is exciting, loaded with great messages (but NOT in an overly preachy way!), and just generally very uplifting! Basically it's just a ""good movie"" in its own right that also has great messages and themes in it. Besides the Gospel, which is presented in a very compelling way, themes of letting go/moving on, the harmfulness of broken families, the harmfulness of sex before marriage and not taking responsibility for your actions, the importance of integrity, and more, are very prevalent. And yet, despite all the positive themes and messages, they are all (including the Gospel) presented in such an engaging and relatively ""real life"" way that they don't really come across too ""preachy"". Thus, unlike some ""Christian movies"", this one could also be a good movie to watch with unbelievers.This movie avoided many of the traps that some other Christian movies have fallen into. For one, it avoids many of the stereotypes you might expect. Even though the two main characters are a black man and a white man, race doesn't really come up in this movie - even though there is tension between the two characters, that tension comes out of the difference in worldview, not race. That right off the bat was refreshing to see. Another thing that I found intriquing is they showed Christians as real-life people! The main Christian character was a guy who genuinely believed and was trying to put his faith into practice, but even he needed to let go and move on in his life from an event that happened in his life a few years before. They even had the unbeliever speak a positive word to him that helped him! Then there's a portrayal of a Christian who really isn't living her life as she should and makes a life-changing mistake, and another Christian that struggles a bit with unforgiveness. Again, this movie broke many of the clich&eacute;s and stereotypes that you might expect from a Christian movie - especially one put out by the BGEA - but that only helps further the messages that the movie works to showcase!Although this movie is centered around two mountain climbers, there's a fair amount of screen time that doesn't actually take place on the mountain, so it's balanced. You can very much enjoy this movie even if you're not into mountain climbing (I'm not!). The production quality and acting in the movie is reasonable enough - the acting is a bit stilted in parts, but it's not bad by any means and is generally ""believable enough"".Now, as for children younger than about age 11 seeing this: This movie is a bit intense in parts, and without giving anything away, there is a tragedy that would be hard for younger viewers to see. In addition, the sex before marriage, anger/unforgiveness at an absentee father, and some of the other themes, really probably aren't appropriate for young children.Chris LongMoviesForChristians Christian Movie Review Ministrymoviesforchristians dot org",5,"Excellent, Exciting, Evangelistic - Something for everyone",1341532800,"07 6, 2012",2012,3339,"['movie', 'Worldwide', 'Pictures', 'movie', 'arm', 'BGEA', 'Billy', 'Graham', 'Evangelistic', 'Association', 'GREAT', 'movie', 'definitely', 'recommended', 'was', 'hesitant', 'even', 'watching', 'film', 'was', 'movie', 'put', 'out', 'BGEA', 'same', 'time', 'thought', 'was', 'bit', 'hokey', 'overly', 'predicatable', 'superficial', 'was', 'half-expecting', 'see', 'similar', 'film', 'am', 'happy', 'report', 'did', ""n't"", 'movie', 'exciting', 'loaded', 'great', 'messages', 'NOT', 'overly', 'preachy', 'way', 'just', 'generally', 'very', 'uplifting', 'Basically', 'just', 'good', 'movie', 'own', 'right', 'also', 'great', 'messages', 'themes', 'Gospel', 'presented', 'very', 'compelling', 'way', 'themes', 'letting', 'go/moving', 'harmfulness', 'broken', 'families', 'harmfulness', 'sex', 'marriage', 'not', 'taking', 'responsibility', 'actions', 'importance', 'integrity', 'more', 'are', 'very', 'prevalent', 'yet', 'positive', 'themes', 'messages', 'are', 'including', 'Gospel', 'presented', 'such', 'engaging', 'relatively', 'real', 'life', 'way', 'do', ""n't"", 'really', 'come', 'too', 'preachy', 'Thus', 'Christian', 'movies', 'one', 'could', 'also', 'be', 'good', 'movie', 'watch', 'unbelievers.This', 'movie', 'avoided', 'many', 'traps', 'other', 'Christian', 'movies', 'have', 'fallen', 'one', 'avoids', 'many', 'stereotypes', 'might', 'expect', 'Even', 'two', 'main', 'characters', 'are', 'black', 'man', 'white', 'man', 'race', ""n't"", 'really', 'come', 'up', 'movie', 'even', 'tension', 'two', 'characters', 'tension', 'difference', 'worldview', 'not', 'race', 'right', 'off', 'bat', 'was', 'refreshing', 'see', 'thing', 'found', 'intriquing', 'showed', 'Christians', 'real-life', 'people', 'main', 'Christian', 'character', 'was', 'guy', 'who', 'genuinely', 'believed', 'was', 'trying', 'put', 'faith', 'practice', 'even', 'needed', 'let', 'go', 'move', 'life', 'event', 'happened', 'life', 'few', 'years', 'even', 'had', 'unbeliever', 'speak', 'positive', 'word', 'helped', 'Then', 'portrayal', 'Christian', 'who', 'really', ""n't"", 'living', 'life', 'should', 'life-changing', 'mistake', 'Christian', 'bit', 'unforgiveness', 'Again', 'movie', 'broke', 'many', 'clich', 'eacute', 'might', 'expect', 'Christian', 'movie', 'especially', 'one', 'put', 'out', 'BGEA', 'only', 'further', 'messages', 'movie', 'showcase', 'movie', 'centered', 'two', 'mountain', 'climbers', 'fair', 'amount', 'screen', 'time', ""n't"", 'actually', 'take', 'place', 'mountain', 'balanced', 'can', 'very', 'much', 'enjoy', 'movie', 'even', ""'re"", 'not', 'mountain', 'climbing', ""'m"", 'not', 'production', 'quality', 'acting', 'movie', 'reasonable', 'enough', 'acting', 'bit', 'stilted', 'parts', 'not', 'bad', 'means', 'generally', 'believable', 'enough', '.Now', 'children', 'younger', 'about', 'age', '11', 'seeing', 'movie', 'bit', 'intense', 'parts', 'giving', 'anything', 'away', 'tragedy', 'would', 'be', 'hard', 'younger', 'viewers', 'see', 'addition', 'sex', 'marriage', 'anger/unforgiveness', 'absentee', 'father', 'other', 'themes', 'really', 'probably', 'are', ""n't"", 'appropriate', 'young', 'children.Chris', 'LongMoviesForChristians', 'Christian', 'Movie', 'Review', 'Ministrymoviesforchristians', 'dot', 'org']",N/A

Lots of movies that have good action have inane (what I call cotton-candy - you might use the term boring) dialogue.  Others have wonderful dialogue but a dearth of action, a situation which could cause a viewer to think about having the oil changed in the car or getting a manicure before the end of the movie.  This one combined both (action and dialogue not oil change and manicure) very nicely.  The ingredient that makes a movie gripping is conflict and the tension that accompanies it.I will be looking for more Billy Graham movies, hoping they're as good as this.  As touched as I was by the movie, I'm not about to sign up soon to conquer Mount Everest, but I have developed an appreciation and understanding for the sport of climbing.  In actuality, I think it would be extremely cool (not to mention cold) to sit on top of a mountain and look down at everything in the distance.
