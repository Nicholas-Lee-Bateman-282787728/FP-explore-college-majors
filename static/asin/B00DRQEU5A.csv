1660749,A2IK776FY6MEMG,B00DRQEU5A,Skipjacks,"[3, 3]","Short Circuit is one of the all time best comedy sci-fi movies. If you can't laugh at a weaponized robat that has given up violence and shouts things at other robots like &#34;Hey, laser lips! Your mama was a snow blower!&#34; then I just don't know what to tell you.....It's cheesy, sure. But it's fun cheesy.The joy of the second movie is that it stays in line with the first one. They don't do a massive change to the look of the film or the characters so they two flow well together. Fisher Stevens and teh robot are the only two characters from teh first film, but they are the same characters in the second. Sometimes in squals you see a character totally rewritten to become a different person. It's annoying.This sequal captures all of the fun of the first movie.The quality of the Blu Ray loses 1 start though because they are not HD prints. They are DVD prints written to a Blu Ray disc.",4,This is one of those few instances where the sequal was still very good,1398297600,"04 24, 2014",2014,897,"['Short', 'Circuit', 'one', 'time', 'best', 'comedy', 'sci-fi', 'movies', 'ca', ""n't"", 'laugh', 'weaponized', 'robat', 'given', 'up', 'violence', 'shouts', 'things', 'other', 'robots', '34', 'Hey', 'laser', 'lips', 'mama', 'was', 'snow', 'blower', '34', 'then', 'just', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'what', 'tell', 'cheesy', 'sure', 'fun', 'cheesy.The', 'joy', 'second', 'movie', 'line', 'first', 'one', 'do', ""n't"", 'do', 'massive', 'change', 'look', 'film', 'characters', 'two', 'flow', 'well', 'together', 'Stevens', 'teh', 'robot', 'are', 'only', 'two', 'characters', 'teh', 'first', 'film', 'are', 'same', 'characters', 'second', 'Sometimes', 'squals', 'see', 'character', 'totally', 'become', 'different', 'person', 'annoying.This', 'sequal', 'captures', 'fun', 'first', 'movie.The', 'quality', 'Blu', 'Ray', '1', 'start', 'are', 'not', 'HD', 'prints', 'are', 'DVD', 'prints', 'written', 'Blu', 'Ray', 'disc']",N/A
