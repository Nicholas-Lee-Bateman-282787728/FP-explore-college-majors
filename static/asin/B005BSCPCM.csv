The lack of history prior to 1964 was very disappointing to me.Unlike ""WWII in HD"", the footage in ""Vietnam in HD"" was produced more like a movie than a documentary. It seemed like its purpose was more to entertain than to educate. This was also disappointing to me.At the end of the Battle of Inchon episode, they described that battle as a triumph and huge success for USA forces. Really? That screamed propaganda to me.

It is hard to comprehend the young kids shooting the video presented in this DVD are now, like me, in their sixties. This DVD is not an in depth study of the war. It does not get into the reasons why this country became both mired in it, and torn apart by it. The Gulf of Tonkin is mentioned as the first step toward increasing  U.S. involvement, but it does not discuss the controversy regarding legitimacy of the Tonkin incident. It doesn't mention Mai Lai, nor does it spend a lot of time discussing the reasons why the American public turned against the war. It is not meant to. This is the recollections of the young Americans who were on the ground, a nurse who served there and a P.O.W.'s wife. It does a great job of describing all the different hard fought engagements with the NVA, and the horror of it all. Many who went to Vietnam were volunteers,but many were draftees with no say in the matter. These young men served without caring about the politics of the time. They went, did what they were told to do, and just tried to stay alive. All Vietnam Vets who served risked their lives, and should be honored for the sacrifices they made. Some just wanted to survive and get home. Others returned home to join those speaking out against U.S. involvement. All were patriotic Americans, and hearing their personal stories put a human face on this war. For those who were interested in this DVD and/or the history of the Vietnam War, I recommend the exceptional PBS Documentary, ""Two Days in October"". Remembering my friend, John.

It is not the whole story however, but it is an important part.  You must also understand the 60's and 70's to help put things into perspective.  The country had no taste for the war and they showed their dislike in very public and personal ways.  Jane Fonda cavorting with the NVA, flag burning and calling the returning soldiers baby killers and spitting on them were just a few.  I volunteered for service because I thought that what was happening in our country and overseas was far too important to set it out on the sidelines.  I couldn't think of anything worse, at the time, than not being able to give my children and/or  grandchildren my firsthand account.  Of the 9,087.000 of us who served, over 66% were volunteers and 58,156 died.

I would recommend this as a solid addition to any Vietnam collection, but don't expect any stunning revelations or personally moving recounting of events of a soldier in the war. One of the reasons that I can't/won't talk about my time there is that it brings back too much of a feeling of loss and only aggravates the PTSD. The loss in the lost youth, the lost friends, the lost innocence and the loss of faith in the leadership of our country and the loss of the US public to at least care when we came home. The PTSD in that when you think about the few people that you let into your guarded psyche and then lost them with either horrible deaths or even worse wounding, and the other events that shook you to your mental core that the person you thought you were could actually do some of these things, these bring back those horrors that invade your mind and feed on your mental stability 24/7.

1452759,A27H9DOUGY9FOS,B005BSCPCM,"K. Harris ""Film aficionado""","[83, 87]","Emulating the formula that worked so successfully with its impressive ""WWII in HD,"" the History Channel set its sights on a new generation of hero with ""Vietnam in HD.""  All of the trademark production values are present including actual footage shot by soldiers in battle as well as high profile actors incorporated into dramatic vocal recreations.  While all of the newly filmed material looks stellar in its HD presentation, the real Vietnam filmstock quality varies depending upon the source material.  It has, however been cleaned and restored to an admirable degree and many of the images (as they were culled from private sources) have not been utilized before in other Vietnam projects.  This found footage provides ""Vietnam in HD"" a real intimacy.  The six part miniseries is both a harrowing and realistic look at the Vietnam conflict as well as a fitting tribute to the men who served.  While few documentaries can hope to cover every angle of this complicated situation (and I'm sure many will point out the subjects that were not covered in depth--for example, almost all focus is on ground forces), ""Vietnam in HD"" scores in an area that counts the most--it honors the soldiers in a very personal way.The basic narrative presentation recounts the stories of 13 men and women, and we see the war unravel from their perspective.  From soldiers, to medical personnel, to reporters, to those on the homefront--this covers a myriad of individual experiences while highlighting key components and chapters of the war itself.Episodes:  (1) The Beginning 1964-1965, (2) Search & Destroy 1966-1967, (3) The Tet Offensive 1968, (4) An Endless War 1968-1969, (5) A Changing War 1969-1970, and (6) Peace With Honor 1971-1975.The miniseries is narrated by Michael C Hall (Dexter) and features a large and diverse vocal cast including James Marsden, Blair Underwood, Jennifer Love Hewitt, Zachary Levi, Armie Hammer, Dylan McDermott, Dean Cain, Adrian Grenier, and Edward Burns among many others.  From the build-up of troops in 1965 to the fall of Saigon a decade later, ""Vietnam in HD"" expertly balances the recreations (that are told through the words of those that are portrayed) and documentary footage.  It is a must for anyone interested in the topic!  KGHarris, 11/11.Bonus features:  Sadly, the 2 disc set contains NO supplemental material.NOTE: While this set still has NO extras, a bonus disc is included with the DVD release with 51 minutes of additional footage if purchased through History Channel website.

These persons are depicted (interviewed/filmed) free and comfortable in, invariably, beautiful homes. Moreover the impression is cultivated that every one of these persons are normal, average Americans who could easily be  neighbors we would be delighted to have. They are depicted as having entered the war as patriotic Americans, babes-in-the-woods, who slowly discover that, like Dorothy, they ""aren't in Kansas anymore"". Their ideals crumble, their faith in America and/or her leadership and institutions begins to waver.As you enter the bowels of the third disc the filmmaker slowly unveils that many of the characters who have been narrating the story for you, are in fact, anti-war radicals, including veterans who marched on the U.S. Capital in company with now Secretary of State John Kerry, who famously accused the veterans he served with with all manner of atrocity; who was exposed by his fellow Swift Boat veterans as having been a conniving, self-serving solider with crass political ambitions even while serving in combat. Another narrator is one of the founders of the organization that gave us the infamous black & white POW/MIA flag (her husband had been missing in action and then POW), so, a great deal is made of this POW/MIA issue. However, in this hack of a documentary I never saw or heard the perspective offered that in WWII, in the United States armed forces, 78,750 missing in action were reported by the conclusion of the war, representing over 19 percent of the total 405,399 killed in the conflict, while in Vietnam 2,255 were unaccounted for, less than 4 percent of the total 58,152 U.S. service members killed. This Vietnam percentage of missing in action is, by far, the smallest proportion in the U.S. history.Typical of media produced that lambastes America's involvement in Vietnam is I saw not a single interview with any of the people we were fighting to defend, or with the South Vietnamese soldiers we fought with and who suffered casualties that make ours look like chump change. Oh, you'll see footage in this documentary of civilians we accidently killed but you won't find a single interview with a South Vietnamese civilian on the street, who were by and large terrified that the Americans would one day leave their country. You'll learn that in combat the North Vietnamese allegedly ""owned the night"", but no where in this DVD does anyone explain that one reason the South Vietnamese lacked strong and courageous leadership on the battlefield (and in politics) is that the North Vietnamese routinely murdered and assassinated South Vietnamese who displayed leadership.I made mention of the freedom and comfortable homes enjoyed by the war protesters  featured in this documentary, but of course this DVD makes no attempt to catalog on film the squalor in which many Vietnamese now live, or the freedom all Vietnamese have been deprived of.
