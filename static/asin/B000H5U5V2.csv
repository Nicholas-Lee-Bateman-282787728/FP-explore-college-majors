I certainly do not know him, but at lease musically, he seems to be the control freak of all time. He never challenges himself and never tours and plays with the great living musicians of our time, like you would see at Concert For George, or Clapton's live stuff.I would love to see Paul do something, like the Band's  ""The Last Waltz"". Record something like George used to do, Ringo does, Clapton, Buddy Guy, Mark Knopfler, Chuck Berry (kind of old), etc, etc. heck all of the great musicians live for the endless growth of being stretched and playing with other great musicians.Paul who sadly wouldn't tour or play live with George or any of the Beatles since. He never seems to grow as a musician which is so sad for fans as well as for Paul's incredible talent.The best part of the DVD is the selection of Beatle songs. Interviews can be truly interesting , but as EXTRA'S, separated from concert footage, or listener selected as voice overs, like directors commentary.Showing fan reactions is so trite and clinched. That is how concert DVDs USED to be and fortunately filming concerts has improved greatly. The audience shots are the music DVD's equivalent to a  ""taught track"" on a bad TV sitcom. But Paul would never let a true pro produce the DVD. Get Jeff Lynne (who did Concert for George, Mark Knopfler (great guitarist, producer, engineer, songwriter, etc). I am sure he could have his pick.I love the Beatles so. I can tell you that the most exciting, emotional and fun ""Beatles"" show I have ever seen was from a unique cover group, ""1964, The Tribute. I cried, danced, sang, their great. What they do is do a live Beatle concert as a tribute from when The Beatles learned their craft from the beginning Hamburg, Germany days. They use the same Vox amps, Rickenbacker guitars, etc from and play the early Beatles songs with the energy of when The Beatles did play live. To hear those harmonies. I got to hear some songs I never heard before. It is like a dream of getting the energy of The Beatles live. The ""George"" guy was my favorite,. Outstanding musician. Saw them in a small theater in Boulder, Colorado and seeing an audience of three generations, rocking out, was a thrill.I would see them again rather than pay the $300-$500 for a ticket to see McCartney and his pickup band members in a large sports stadium.",3,"Great songs, but Paul plways plays it safe",1163462400,"11 14, 2006",2006,2465,"['Someone', 'wrote', 'comment', 'Paul', 'should', 'have', 'played', 'did', 'magnificent', 'Concert', 'George.That', 'issue', 'Paul', 'certainly', 'do', 'not', 'know', 'lease', 'musically', 'be', 'control', 'freak', 'time', 'never', 'never', 'tours', 'plays', 'great', 'living', 'musicians', 'time', 'would', 'see', 'Concert', 'George', 'Clapton', 'live', 'stuff.I', 'would', 'love', 'see', 'Paul', 'do', 'something', 'Band', 'Last', 'Waltz', 'Record', 'something', 'George', 'used', 'do', 'Ringo', 'Clapton', 'Buddy', 'Guy', 'Mark', 'Knopfler', 'Chuck', 'Berry', 'kind', 'old', 'etc', 'etc', 'heck', 'great', 'musicians', 'live', 'endless', 'growth', 'being', 'stretched', 'playing', 'other', 'great', 'musicians.Paul', 'who', 'sadly', 'would', ""n't"", 'tour', 'play', 'live', 'George', 'Beatles', 'never', 'grow', 'musician', 'so', 'sad', 'fans', 'as', 'well', 'Paul', 'incredible', 'talent.The', 'best', 'part', 'DVD', 'selection', 'Beatle', 'songs', 'Interviews', 'can', 'be', 'truly', 'interesting', 'EXTRA', 'separated', 'concert', 'footage', 'listener', 'selected', 'voice', 'overs', 'directors', 'commentary.Showing', 'fan', 'reactions', 'so', 'trite', 'clinched', 'how', 'concert', 'DVDs', 'USED', 'be', 'fortunately', 'filming', 'concerts', 'improved', 'greatly', 'audience', 'shots', 'are', 'music', 'DVD', 'equivalent', 'taught', 'track', 'bad', 'TV', 'sitcom', 'Paul', 'would', 'never', 'let', 'true', 'pro', 'produce', 'DVD', 'Get', 'Jeff', 'Lynne', 'who', 'did', 'Concert', 'George', 'Mark', 'Knopfler', 'great', 'guitarist', 'producer', 'engineer', 'songwriter', 'etc', 'am', 'sure', 'could', 'have', 'pick.I', 'love', 'Beatles', 'so', 'can', 'tell', 'most', 'exciting', 'emotional', 'fun', 'Beatles', 'show', 'have', 'ever', 'seen', 'was', 'unique', 'cover', 'group', '1964', 'Tribute', 'cried', 'danced', 'sang', 'great', 'What', 'do', 'do', 'live', 'Beatle', 'concert', 'tribute', 'when', 'Beatles', 'learned', 'craft', 'beginning', 'Hamburg', 'Germany', 'days', 'use', 'same', 'Vox', 'amps', 'Rickenbacker', 'etc', 'play', 'early', 'Beatles', 'songs', 'energy', 'when', 'Beatles', 'did', 'play', 'live', 'hear', 'harmonies', 'got', 'hear', 'songs', 'never', 'heard', 'dream', 'getting', 'energy', 'Beatles', 'live', 'George', 'guy', 'was', 'favorite', 'Outstanding', 'musician', 'Saw', 'small', 'theater', 'Boulder', 'Colorado', 'seeing', 'audience', 'three', 'generations', 'rocking', 'out', 'was', 'thrill.I', 'would', 'see', 'again', 'rather', 'pay', '300-', '500', 'ticket', 'see', 'McCartney', 'pickup', 'band', 'members', 'large', 'sports', 'stadium']",Paul McCartney - The Space Within US

All of these products have been excellent reminders of Paul's boundless energy and love for his audience.The lateest offering, 2005's concert dvd ""The Space Within Us"", is no exception. Filmed over various stops on Paul's 2005 American tour, in which Paul performed a record breaking show broadcast via satellite to two astronatus orbiting out solar system.The performances are top notch. I must say, the set list is the most differnt from other dvds (which is a very good thing). Concert favorites such as ""Band On The Run"", ""Jet"", ""Live And Let Die"" and others have been omitted for lesserr heard tracks such as ""I'll Get You"", ""I Will"", ""I've Got A Feeling"", and ""Please Please Me"". It's a thrill to finally here these songs in a live venue, and while you definitely miss some of the regulars I just mentioned, you wouldn;t trade these performances in for the world.The interviews, even when they interrupt the songs, are very insightful and informative, and don't take away from the viewers' enjoyment in any way. Paul greets his fans, chats it up with his crew as well as celebs, and overall shows the Paul we all know and love.This is another excelletn concert dvd from the one and only Sir Paul McCartney.

Several of the negative reviews are on target. I resisted buying the DVD when it was first issued after reading some of the reviews. But the blue ray edition generated many more five star reviews which caught my attention and changed my mind.This is not a straight through concert but delightful nonetheless. Sir Paul performs many Fab Four songs and several from his solo years. The film is filled with family oriented images from the concert tour. The band executes well and most consumers with a large video collection will keep this somewhat unusual concert format too in their libraries. Picture quality is very good. Audio is ok, not superb (redistributed 2 channel stereo).I yearn for blue ray editions of Joe Cocker's ""Across From Midnight"", the Stones' ""Rock N' Roll Circus"" and Roger Waters' ""The Wall in Berlin"".

1009898,AL1PNYDIILV4D,B000H5U5V2,Bill Michaels,"[4, 6]","I have come to the conclusion that Paul has a self esteem problem. The DVD is loaded with the likes of Bill Clinton, Steve Jobs, Cameron Crow and some so called experts (one calls himself a ""music therapist""? what?) who continually tell us (for two hours) of the magnitude and importance of Paul McCartney's very existence. If you replaced Paul with Jesus, you could skip church on Sunday. There's something woefully off track when the DVD comes off as a self delusional documentary with the music almost as filler. All you hear is what an inspiration he is, what a great guy he is, what an ""average"" guy he is, his work is actually ""divine intervention"", etc. In my opinion, Paul has set a calculated course to absorb as much of the Beatles existence as he possibly can. No doubt he was a huge contributor to the Beatles but watching this DVD it as though John Lennon was nothing but a session musician and George and Ringo stage hands. In other words, Paul was the Beatles. I'm sorry, but his recent handful of DVDs have been going down this path with this one being the most self aggrandizing to date. If Paul really wants to tip his hat to his Beatle roots, then have Ringo play through some (if not all) of the Beatle songs. Plus I'm also tired of Rusty his guitar player botching the leads. It was painfully obvious he did not know the lead guitar ending to ""Too Many People"" which is blistering on the record but with Rusty relegating it to some on the fly, made up jumble of notes that ended up being an insult to a great song. And while I'm on the topic, someone please give that boy a copy of the song Let It Be so he can learn George's lead. That's another example where he continually misses the guitar work and there's absolutely no excuse for it. The songs are still great but Paul's approach of pumping up his own tires is growing very, very old and it does affect ones ability to enjoy the DVD. ** BnB Beatles Depot **",3,Paul continues to pat himself on the back,1164412800,"11 25, 2006",2006,1934,"['have', 'come', 'conclusion', 'Paul', 'self', 'esteem', 'problem', 'DVD', 'loaded', 'likes', 'Bill', 'Clinton', 'Steve', 'Jobs', 'Cameron', 'Crow', 'so', 'called', 'experts', 'one', 'music', 'therapist', 'what', 'who', 'continually', 'tell', 'two', 'hours', 'magnitude', 'importance', 'Paul', 'McCartney', 'very', 'existence', 'replaced', 'Paul', 'Jesus', 'could', 'skip', 'church', 'Sunday', 'something', 'woefully', 'off', 'track', 'when', 'DVD', 'off', 'self', 'delusional', 'documentary', 'music', 'almost', 'filler', 'hear', 'what', 'inspiration', 'what', 'great', 'guy', 'what', 'average', 'guy', 'work', 'actually', 'divine', 'intervention', 'etc', 'opinion', 'Paul', 'set', 'calculated', 'course', 'absorb', 'much', 'Beatles', 'existence', 'possibly', 'can', 'doubt', 'was', 'huge', 'contributor', 'Beatles', 'watching', 'DVD', 'John', 'Lennon', 'was', 'nothing', 'session', 'musician', 'George', 'Ringo', 'stage', 'hands', 'other', 'words', 'Paul', 'was', 'Beatles', ""'m"", 'sorry', 'recent', 'handful', 'DVDs', 'have', 'been', 'going', 'path', 'one', 'being', 'most', 'self', 'aggrandizing', 'date', 'Paul', 'really', 'tip', 'hat', 'Beatle', 'roots', 'then', 'have', 'Ringo', 'play', 'not', 'Beatle', 'songs', ""'m"", 'also', 'tired', 'Rusty', 'guitar', 'player', 'botching', 'leads', 'was', 'painfully', 'obvious', 'did', 'not', 'know', 'lead', 'guitar', 'ending', 'Too', 'Many', 'People', 'blistering', 'record', 'Rusty', 'relegating', 'fly', 'made', 'up', 'jumble', 'notes', 'ended', 'up', 'being', 'insult', 'great', 'song', ""'m"", 'topic', 'someone', 'please', 'give', 'boy', 'copy', 'song', 'Let', 'Be', 'so', 'can', 'learn', 'George', 'lead', 'example', 'where', 'continually', 'guitar', 'work', 'absolutely', 'excuse', 'songs', 'are', 'still', 'great', 'Paul', 'approach', 'pumping', 'up', 'own', 'tires', 'growing', 'very', 'very', 'old', 'affect', 'ones', 'ability', 'enjoy', 'DVD', '**', 'BnB', 'Beatles', 'Depot', '**']",Paul McCartney - The Space Within US

1009902,A2WLZD9BY669HY,B000H5U5V2,Candace Scott,"[9, 11]","Paul has issued official concert films for every tour since '76 and he always makes the same mistake: too many audience shots, not enough Macca. One would have thought he'd have listened to the crescendo of complaints about the '89, '93 and 2002 concert DVD's which abound with audience shots. Enough already! I was praying Macca would finally issue a film in the style of ""The Concert for George"" in 2003 which kept the camera firmly fixed where it belongs: on the stage, not focused in on various besotted stars/oldsters/teeny boppers/silicone implanted audience members.I was fortunate to have seen the 2005 McCartney concert in six different venues and no movie can possibly convey the emotional impact this man has when you see him in person. I've never taken heroin, but that might be the only thing on earth (besides one other...) that packs a bigger wallop than seeing McCartney singing songs that have formed the tapestry of your life. Being in the 4th row and looking into Paul's eyes when he sings Yesterday is living large, to put it mildly.I was irritated that the DVD omits many songs from the tour, including Band on the Run, Jet, and In Spite of All the Danger. They also edit Let it Be and Hey Jude and inexplicably omit Paul's banter between songs.  The fawning interviews which gush over Paul's brilliance are unnecessary and gratuitous. Yes, he's a God, but he's not Bach or Mozart, as one professor claims with an apparently straight face. There are also two hideously boring scenes of fan's homes where they predictably bring out the Beatles bobbing head dolls and bubblegum cards. They cut out Band on the Run for this drivel? Who is editing this stuff?One final pleasing aspect is the complete omission of Heather Mills McCartney who no Paul fan wants to see or be reminded of. Thank God this troll is history.All in all, you'll enjoy it to the hilt if you love Paul, especially if you saw the concert live.

If you are a Paul McCartney fan, or a member of your family is a Paul McCartney fan you will definitely want to pick up the DVD Paul McCartney The Space Within US. The DVD was released by the A&E; on November 14th. The DVD highlights Paul's 2005 US tour with behind the scenes footage and live concert performances.What makes Paul McCartney The Space Within US so cool is that it is so much more than just a concert film. It's more like a concert documentary with performances intermixed. As a home viewer, you get a behind the scenes look at the crew and behind the scenes action that was the US tour. Not only that, there are some really cool scenes with die hard Beatles and Paul McCartney fans. One family appears to be three generations of McCartney fans and they all agree he gets better with age. One interesting comment that filmmaker Cameron Crowe made regarding McCartney is that he ""endorses the nostalgia,"" and acclaimed music writer Bob Spitz affirms that McCartney doesn't deny them (fans of all ages) his music. It's not uncommon to see fans age 6 to 60 and beyond at a McCartney concert.Paul McCartney The Space Within US is a very interesting docu-concert. So often when you purchase concert DVD's, it's the performance and that's it, but with The Space Within US you really feel like you get the total package. It's clear a lot of time and effort was put into this DVD, as it captures big moments (Paul McCartney and his crowd of fans singing to the astronauts on the International Space Station), and the small moments, (Paul commenting on how great it is to be escorted through traffic by a six police officer motorcade). If you had a chance to catch the US tour live, you will be glad to know that the film shown before the concert is included on the DVD in the special features. Other special features include sound checks, a featurette titled ""On The Road With US,"" and a featured titled ""More About US."" The DVD booklet includes a listing of all of the US 2005 Tour Dates, a forward by Cameron Crowe, and photographs.The set list is varied as it contains newer songs, Beatles hits, and solo classics. It's really great to see the crowd of various ages come alive and everyone singing along on songs like ""Penny Lane,"" I mean everyone young and old seemed to know the lyrics.",5,I Personally Was Very Pleased With This DVD,1163376000,"11 13, 2006",2006,2392,"['are', ""n't"", 'many', 'living', 'musicians', 'internationally', 'well', 'known', 'loved', 'Paul', 'McCartney', 'are', 'Paul', 'McCartney', 'fan', 'member', 'family', 'Paul', 'McCartney', 'fan', 'will', 'definitely', 'want', 'pick', 'up', 'DVD', 'Paul', 'McCartney', 'Space', 'Within', 'US', 'DVD', 'was', 'released', 'A', 'E', 'November', '14th', 'DVD', 'highlights', 'Paul', '2005', 'US', 'tour', 'scenes', 'footage', 'live', 'concert', 'performances.What', 'Paul', 'McCartney', 'Space', 'Within', 'US', 'cool', 'so', 'much', 'more', 'just', 'concert', 'film', 'more', 'concert', 'documentary', 'performances', 'intermixed', 'home', 'viewer', 'get', 'scenes', 'look', 'crew', 'scenes', 'action', 'was', 'US', 'tour', 'Not', 'only', 'are', 'really', 'cool', 'scenes', 'die', 'hard', 'Beatles', 'Paul', 'McCartney', 'fans', 'One', 'family', 'be', 'three', 'generations', 'McCartney', 'fans', 'agree', 'better', 'age', 'One', 'interesting', 'comment', 'filmmaker', 'Cameron', 'Crowe', 'made', 'regarding', 'McCartney', 'nostalgia', 'acclaimed', 'music', 'writer', 'Bob', 'Spitz', 'McCartney', ""n't"", 'deny', 'fans', 'ages', 'music', 'not', 'uncommon', 'see', 'fans', 'age', '6', '60', 'McCartney', 'concert.Paul', 'McCartney', 'Space', 'Within', 'US', 'very', 'interesting', 'docu-concert', 'So', 'often', 'when', 'purchase', 'concert', 'DVD', 'performance', 'Space', 'Within', 'US', 'really', 'feel', 'get', 'total', 'package', 'clear', 'lot', 'time', 'effort', 'was', 'put', 'DVD', 'big', 'moments', 'Paul', 'McCartney', 'crowd', 'fans', 'singing', 'astronauts', 'International', 'Space', 'Station', 'small', 'moments', 'Paul', 'commenting', 'how', 'great', 'be', 'escorted', 'traffic', 'six', 'police', 'officer', 'motorcade', 'had', 'chance', 'catch', 'US', 'tour', 'live', 'will', 'be', 'glad', 'know', 'film', 'shown', 'concert', 'included', 'DVD', 'special', 'features', 'Other', 'special', 'features', 'include', 'sound', 'checks', 'featurette', 'titled', 'Road', 'US', 'featured', 'titled', 'More', 'US', 'DVD', 'booklet', 'listing', 'US', '2005', 'Tour', 'Dates', 'forward', 'Cameron', 'Crowe', 'photographs.The', 'set', 'list', 'varied', 'newer', 'songs', 'Beatles', 'solo', 'classics', 'really', 'great', 'see', 'crowd', 'various', 'ages', 'come', 'alive', 'everyone', 'singing', 'songs', 'Penny', 'Lane', 'mean', 'everyone', 'young', 'old', 'seemed', 'know', 'lyrics']",Paul McCartney - The Space Within US

I found a great deal of the documentary which intertwines with the concert, often discomfiting and sometimes terribly embarrassing. The man's achievements in the public arena speak loud enough for most people to make a judgment of his worth; to spend such a disproportionate share of time offering evidence that Sir Paul is really another Saint Paul is quite offensive. Why former American President Clinton lent himself to the proceedings puzzles me. By the way,  none of what I say, should be taken as any criticism of the life or work of Paul McCartney;  I know nothing of the former and the latter is open to everyone's own consideration..Putting that grievance aside, I would commend the concert segment to everyone who has seen at least the first two Beatle films.

Kraut,"[6, 8]","I want to address the problem of excessive audience footage, since it seems to be the most consistently important theme in the reviews of this film. First of all, I didn't find it nearly as distracting as reviewers prepared me for. For one thing, counter to expectations, all songs (I think - maybe there's an exception or two but I didn't notice.) are presented in their entirety. But yes, there's a lot of ""Us.""Why? Because of Paul's ""ego?"" Well, YEAH! Is there a surprise there? Has Paul McCartney's narcissism been painstakingly kept under wraps until now? (""NEW EX-BEATLE DOCUMENTARY EXPOSES FORMER MOP TOP'S BIG HEAD!"") My own feeling is that he likes to disguise his need for approval (and adoration) with a faux-egalitarian presentation, like, ""You guys are really just as important as I am!"" In reality, it's more like ""Look at how much everybody loves me!""How about this - Would it have been possible for the Beatles to have been as big as they were for all these years and not have immense egos? Can you even truly imagine how bizarre and extraordinarily bewildering it must have been to be a Beatle? As Paul himself says at some point during the film, you're not just what you think you are anymore; you're also what they think you are.And why would this issue be important anyway? If you think his ego is too big, don't become his friend. Just listen to his music, which is among the most memorable and consistently charming of the 20th Century.On this DVD, McCartney delivers big-time when it comes to the music. The rockers rock relentlessly; the ballads are gorgeous and heartfelt and the scope and depth of the material is simply astounding. Like all the famous (and not famous) people tell you throughout the movie, he's really, really big. And he's in his mid-sixties, so the whole Lifetime Achievement thing is beginning to take center stage. As an artist ages, we tend to fall more deeply in love with him - or at least our loyalty begins to obscure our more discerning judgment, particularly if he's part of the soundtrack of our own aging. Maybe he's become a really comfortable old shirt - we've had him around so long he just feels good being there.I don't think I've ever seen one of the old-style McCartney concerts before he had returned to the Beatle stuff. Since he's been reclaimed his glorious past, however,(which he'd be an absolute fool to resist) I find his concerts thrilling. I loved the Beatles as an adolescent when they were actually releasing their new material, and I'm so grateful to have some of that wonderful energy still being put into the air.

This is the best band McCartney has worked with since, well, you know.... The trouble with this DVD is that the music is constantly interupted by talking heads gushing over McCartney's well established virtues of being the genuine article who loves to go to work each day and do his job. He was raised that way. It shows, and he's very sincere about that value in his life. I admire him for it. I've seen it loads of times in big and small moments. I don't need to keep seeing it. Message received. Over and out.In this particular film the intrusions are too much. Carrie Underwood seems to suggest a very private moment has brought her to tears. God bless Macca if it's true, but you don't need that right now either. I loved the performances in the film - it's what Paul does, and it's great. The rest comes off as displaying an insecurity that I hadn't really noticed before. As though he needed to hear how much fans and celebrities thought of him, which is a different angle than previous efforts where he explained his work ethic as a devotion to his fans, the subtext of his looming divorce must have knackered him inside in his guts. He even looks a little edgier at times, which could be the result of dealing with tabloid stories. At first I thought all the testimonials were way too ego-driven, but when you think about why that might be so, the underlying cause is some severe insecurity threatening his sense of self. This is not as self-destructive as Crosby's meltdown in DAYLIGHT AGAIN, but still you see the cracks where they never were before. Post Beatles, pre-Wings, McCartney was retreating to Scotland. What ravages that wrought he put into LIVERPOOL ORATORIO. Now it's all out front and I'm sure he takes a lot of the tabloid fueled speculation personally, as must Mills. Hard to keep your dignity.

There were way way too many shots of the audience and the constant changing of camera angles was very annoying. I was looking forward to having video of some of the songs he had not performed before.  Instead  the TV special had endless shots of people lip syncing, dancing,hugging, wiping a tear from their cheek and mugging for the cameras, people holding up their children and even one airhead waving her cell phone around. Hey I get it, seeing Paul in concert is a very exhillarating and emotional experience. Don't hit me over the head with it. Other concert videos show the audience in concert without destroying the performance. Check out the Moody Blues Live at Red Rocks. Lots of audience shots but not this level of distraction.I feel bad for people who did not get to see him in concert who buy this DVD.  Unless you spend 50-60% of your time watching the audience instead of the stage,  you will not get the concert experience.

There's something quite special about the performances in this DVD, something that is quite emotionally-involving. Let me put it this way: I saw Paul live in '02 on the Back In The USA tour and this DVD is much, much better than that show. And Rusty, Brian, Abraham & Wix have really gelled since becoming the band for Macca - they're tighter than ever.

There is more focus on the stage this time around, and the interviews with insiders are good.  The tour was entitled ""The Space Within Us"" and the focus was on the community of like-minded people who get together to enjoy the music--in some cases, three generations of a family.  So the focus of the tour helps diffuse some of the criticism about the attention paid to the audience.  Segments on Macca-obsessed fan families preparing to go watch the concert were unsettling and perhaps unintentionally self-serving.  Macca wants to be viewed as an ordinary guy, but then in his DVD, people talk of him as some kind of god.  I'm not sure if that sends the message he was trying to convey or contradicts it.McCartney's band is made up of talented musicians who manage to stay in the background while putting out sounds surprisingly Beatle-like, though no one can duplicate George Harrison's guitar or Lennon's voice.Overall, an enjoyable concert film with well-mixed music and good song selection.

There is a huge minority of McCartney fans out there that despises the hollow theatrics and redundant myth-making, and it's a shame to think that he still feels called upon to constantly succumb to shark-eyed mass adulation.",3,"Paul As Entertainer, Not Artist",1165968000,"12 13, 2006",2006,912,"['echo', 'many', 'many', 'complaints', 'here', 'band', 'utterly', 'fantastic', 'Paul', 'genuinely', 'relaxed', 'onstage', 'watching', 'how', 'guitar', 'lead', 'Foxey', 'Lady', 'riff', 'early', 'SO', 'refreshing', 'tunes', 'are', 'world', 'working', 'greatest', 'band', 'assembled', 'post-Beatles', 'era', 'coming', 'off', 'string', 'superlative', 'albums', 'out', 'yet', 'dvd', 'chock', 'full', 'soul-crushingly', 'sycophantic', 'messiah-worship', 'bit', 'as', 'ham-fisted', 'best', 'work', 'nuanced', 'agree', 'deep-seated', 'insecurity', 'not', 'excess', 'arrogance', 'was', 'John', 'Lennon', 'put', 'out', 'infomercial-eque', 'drivel', 'huge', 'minority', 'McCartney', 'fans', 'out', 'there', 'hollow', 'theatrics', 'redundant', 'myth-making', 'shame', 'think', 'still', 'called', 'constantly', 'succumb', 'shark-eyed', 'mass', 'adulation']",Paul McCartney - The Space Within US
1009940,A19DW3VKM5KKYB,B000H5U5V2,TheBandit,"[9, 10]","I saw this show live and it was even better than his 2002 outing, which was also a great concert.  Paul's band became a lot tighter - and more rocking - in the three years between the 'Back in the U.S.' tour and the so-called 'US' tour.  Both shows had excellent set lists, but '05 benefited from a tremendously better new album to promote.  He may not have done many new songs on either tour, but I'd much rather hear stuff from ""Chaos"" than ""Driving Rain.""  Also, Paul's chattiness during the concert continued from '02 - he told lots of a great stories before many songs, something nearly absent from his last round of big stadium shows ('89/90 and '93).Sadly, the producers of ""The Space Within US"" commit the same errors as those responsible for ""Back In the U.S.""The hyperactive editing is truly staggering...in the worst sense of the word.  Why would anyone want to see so much of the audience?  The best concert movies minimize audience shots, sometimes it feels like in any given song the audience is show at least as much as Paul and the band.  When Paul IS shown, the camera is usually quite distant and moving all over the place.I do have an idea about what these editorial choices are made.  Paul McCartney is not a very visually dynamic performer.  By no means do I mean anything against his musicianship or his vocals.  Just from a purely visual aspect, he really isn't very interesting to watch.  That said, I WOULD rather watch him and his bandmates instead of the audience - but I mention the lack of visual presence as a possible reasoning behind the ridiculous camera-work and editing.I have no such idea about why (why? Why??? WHY??!!) these McCartney concert DVDs always interrupt the flow of the concert with inane interview clips.  As voiced by so many fans, it's safe to say many of us would love to just have a tastefully (read: simply) staged presentation of an entire complete concert.  It doesn't have to be  *the same* concert, if it's a composite of the best parts of numerous shows just edit it together in a way that preserves the flow and feel of the concert.  It's been said a ton of times:  the behind-the-scenes stuff and all the ego-boosting testimonials can be saved for the special features.So far only one McCartney live DVD delivers the performance in such a straight-forward manner:  ""Live at the Cavern Club.""  Of course, that was a less-than-an-hour long one-off concert that featured mostly non-original material.  But at least it didn't interrupt the show with nonsense.  It would be nice to see that kind of presentation for his next big arena tour.The special features are not all that special.  I liked the soundcheck performances best - especially two excellent versions of songs from ""Chaos and Creation"" that weren't featured in the main concert (""Friends To Go"" and ""How Kind of You"").",2,Another MAJOR disappointing DVD of a GREAT tour,1195430400,"11 19, 2007",2007,2839,"['saw', 'show', 'live', 'was', 'even', 'better', '2002', 'outing', 'was', 'also', 'great', 'concert', 'Paul', 'band', 'became', 'lot', 'tighter', 'more', 'rocking', 'three', 'years', ""'Back"", 'U.S.', 'tour', 'so-called', ""'US"", 'tour', 'shows', 'had', 'excellent', 'set', 'lists', 'benefited', 'tremendously', 'better', 'new', 'album', 'promote', 'may', 'not', 'have', 'done', 'many', 'new', 'songs', 'tour', ""'d"", 'much', 'rather', 'hear', 'stuff', 'Chaos', 'Driving', 'Rain', 'Also', 'Paul', 'chattiness', 'concert', 'continued', ""'02"", 'told', 'lots', 'great', 'stories', 'many', 'songs', 'something', 'nearly', 'absent', 'last', 'round', 'big', 'stadium', 'shows', ""'89/90"", '.Sadly', 'producers', 'Space', 'Within', 'US', 'commit', 'same', 'errors', 'responsible', 'Back', 'U.S.', 'hyperactive', 'editing', 'truly', 'staggering', 'worst', 'sense', 'word', 'Why', 'would', 'anyone', 'want', 'see', 'so', 'much', 'audience', 'best', 'concert', 'movies', 'minimize', 'audience', 'shots', 'given', 'song', 'audience', 'show', 'least', 'as', 'much', 'Paul', 'band', 'When', 'Paul', 'IS', 'shown', 'camera', 'usually', 'quite', 'distant', 'moving', 'place.I', 'do', 'have', 'idea', 'what', 'editorial', 'choices', 'are', 'made', 'Paul', 'McCartney', 'not', 'very', 'visually', 'dynamic', 'performer', 'means', 'do', 'mean', 'anything', 'musicianship', 'vocals', 'Just', 'purely', 'visual', 'aspect', 'really', ""n't"", 'very', 'interesting', 'watch', 'said', 'WOULD', 'rather', 'watch', 'bandmates', 'instead', 'audience', 'mention', 'lack', 'visual', 'presence', 'possible', 'reasoning', 'ridiculous', 'camera-work', 'editing.I', 'have', 'such', 'idea', 'why', 'why', 'Why', 'WHY', 'McCartney', 'concert', 'DVDs', 'always', 'interrupt', 'flow', 'concert', 'inane', 'interview', 'clips', 'voiced', 'so', 'many', 'fans', 'safe', 'say', 'many', 'would', 'love', 'just', 'have', 'tastefully', 'read', 'simply', 'staged', 'presentation', 'entire', 'complete', 'concert', ""n't"", 'have', 'be', '*the', 'same*', 'concert', 'composite', 'best', 'parts', 'numerous', 'shows', 'just', 'edit', 'together', 'way', 'flow', 'feel', 'concert', 'been', 'said', 'ton', 'times', 'behind-the-scenes', 'stuff', 'ego-boosting', 'testimonials', 'can', 'be', 'saved', 'special', 'features.So', 'far', 'only', 'one', 'McCartney', 'live', 'DVD', 'performance', 'such', 'straight-forward', 'manner', 'Live', 'Cavern', 'Club', 'course', 'was', 'less-than-an-hour', 'long', 'one-off', 'concert', 'featured', 'mostly', 'non-original', 'material', 'least', 'did', ""n't"", 'interrupt', 'show', 'nonsense', 'would', 'be', 'nice', 'see', 'kind', 'presentation', 'next', 'big', 'arena', 'tour.The', 'special', 'features', 'are', 'not', 'special', 'liked', 'soundcheck', 'best', 'especially', 'two', 'excellent', 'versions', 'songs', 'Chaos', 'Creation', 'were', ""n't"", 'featured', 'main', 'concert', 'Friends', 'Go', 'How', 'Kind']",Paul McCartney - The Space Within US

The best part about this DVD is Heather has been edited out and deleted.Why can't Paul seem to produce a decent concert video that represents the actual show? We all love Paul but to beat us over the head with all the talking heads and accolades between every freakin' song is unbelievable. Re-release the entire show and put all the other stuff on a second disc for those who want to see it.Hint: Take a look at U2's Live From Boston DVD from 2001. It captured the show as it happened...the other interviews and footage were on the second disc. Brilliant! Who would've thunk it? They did the same thing with the ""Concert For George"".  Hey Paul!  Hire those guys!I'll never buy another McCartney DVD and I'll tell you why....they're all the same, they're all disappointing: Song, interview adoring fans or producers, song, strange footage, song, show fan crying during Yesterday, song, Paul visits local politician, song, etc, etc, etc.....and every song is interrupted by a pan of the crowd.

Unlike some fans, I actually enjoy the audience shots. It's great to see them enjoying the show as much as I do. I also like the backstage scenes, fan comments, etc. But, I wish they were located in the 'special features'section. It would be great if Paul's concert DVDs covered the entire concerts from beginning to end. But, we live in an imperfect world, don't we?&lt;G> Here's the setlist from the DVD,,,,""Magical Mystery Tour""""Flaming Pie""""Let Me Roll It""""Drive My Car""""Till There Was You""""I'll Get You""""Eleanor Rigby""""Maybe I'm Amazed""""Got to Get You Into My Life""""Fine Line""""I Will""""I'll Follow The Sun""""Good Day Sunshine""""For No One""""Fixing A Hole""""Penny Lane""""Too Many People""""She Came in Thru The Bathroom  Window""""English Tea""""i've Got A Feeling""""Follow Me""""Jenny Wren""""Helter Skelter""""Yesterday""""Get Back""""Please Please Me"" At the conclusion of ""Let Me Roll It,"" the band launches into an instrumental version of Jimi Hendrix's ""Foxey Lady."" It's a pleasant surprise and lasts about 45 seconds or so.  I guess the highlights for me would be ""Please Please Me"" and ""Till There Was You."" Rusty's guitar work on the latter really makes the tune. The 'special features' include three tunes from the soundchecks. Paul does a neat cover of ""Whole Lot Of Shakin' Going On"" that would make Jerry Lee proud. The ten minute opening film from the tour is shown in its entirety and there are also a couple of other niceties thrown in for good measure. ""Helen Wheels"" provides the soundtrack for one of them, and the re-mastering is first rate. The DVD comes with a nice little booklet with photos and commentary. IMO, ""The Space Within Us"" is a 'must have' for Macca fans.  You get a lot of bang for your buck  with this DVD. The entire running time is approximately two and a half hours. Not a bad investment for 15 bucks! For those fans who don't care for the fan comments, backstage shots, etc, you can program your DVD player to play only the songs. This will give you almost 30 full-length tunes to enjoy.",5,MACCA ROCKS!!!,1163635200,"11 16, 2006",2006,2192,"[""'ve"", 'been', 'major', 'Beatles/Macca', 'fan', '1967', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'one', 'show', 'U.S.', 'tour', 'Paul', 'done', 'last', 'one', 'was', 'very', 'pleased', 'when', 'heard', 'DVD', 'fans', 'actually', 'enjoy', 'audience', 'shots', 'great', 'see', 'enjoying', 'show', 'as', 'much', 'do', 'also', 'backstage', 'scenes', 'fan', 'comments', 'etc', 'wish', 'were', 'located', ""'special"", ""features'section"", 'would', 'be', 'great', 'Paul', 'concert', 'DVDs', 'covered', 'entire', 'concerts', 'beginning', 'end', 'live', 'imperfect', 'world', 'do', ""n't"", 'lt', 'G', '>', 'Here', 'setlist', 'DVD', 'Magical', 'Mystery', 'Tour', 'Flaming', 'Pie', 'Let', 'Me', 'Roll', 'Drive', 'My', 'Car', 'Till', 'Was', ""'ll"", 'Get', 'Eleanor', 'Rigby', 'Maybe', ""'m"", 'Amazed', 'Got', 'Get', 'Into', 'My', 'Life', 'Fine', 'Line', 'Will', ""'ll"", 'Follow', 'Sun', 'Good', 'Day', 'Sunshine', 'One', 'Fixing', 'Hole', 'Penny', 'Lane', 'Too', 'Many', 'People', 'Came', 'Thru', 'Bathroom', 'Window', 'English', 'Tea', 'i', ""'ve"", 'Got', 'Feeling', 'Me', 'Jenny', 'Wren', 'Helter', 'Skelter', 'Yesterday', 'Get', 'Back', 'Please', 'Please', 'Me', 'conclusion', 'Let', 'Me', 'Roll', 'band', 'instrumental', 'version', 'Jimi', 'Hendrix', 'Foxey', 'Lady', 'pleasant', 'surprise', 'about', '45', 'seconds', 'so', 'guess', 'highlights', 'would', 'be', 'Please', 'Please', 'Me', 'Till', 'Was', 'Rusty', 'guitar', 'work', 'latter', 'really', 'tune', ""'special"", 'features', 'include', 'three', 'tunes', 'soundchecks', 'Paul', 'neat', 'cover', 'Whole', 'Lot', 'Shakin', 'Going', 'would', 'make', 'Jerry', 'Lee', 'proud', 'ten', 'minute', 'opening', 'film', 'tour', 'shown', 'entirety', 'are', 'also', 'couple', 'other', 'niceties', 'thrown', 'good', 'measure', 'Helen', 'Wheels', 'soundtrack', 'one', 're-mastering', 'first', 'rate', 'DVD', 'nice', 'little', 'booklet', 'photos', 'commentary', 'IMO', 'Space', 'Within', 'Us', ""'must"", 'have', ""'"", 'Macca', 'fans', 'get', 'lot', 'bang', 'buck', 'DVD', 'entire', 'running', 'time', 'approximately', 'two', 'half', 'hours', 'Not', 'bad', 'investment', '15', 'bucks', 'fans', 'who', 'do', ""n't"", 'care', 'fan', 'comments', 'backstage', 'shots', 'etc', 'can', 'program', 'DVD', 'player', 'play', 'only', 'songs', 'will', 'give', 'almost', '30', 'full-length', 'tunes', 'enjoy']",Paul McCartney - The Space Within US
