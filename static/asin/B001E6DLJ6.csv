There is a wonderful rhythm to this show. The chemistry between Joe Penny and William Conrad is awesome. While the stories are good, you can tell they tried not to take the show too seriously. Just take the intro, where both Conrad and Penny can't keep from laughing. It gives the show a light-hearted touch even during the most serious of cases. The producers definitely played up the fat slob persona for Conrad's character - at times a little too much - but it totally fits. There are enough twists to keep this from becoming a predictable series.

It reminds me a little of COLUMBO, since one of the producers is involved. I would rate the intro as the best of any show. I hope they release all the seasons! You can't beat the older crime shows. You see a lot of nice scenery, and at a slower pace.
