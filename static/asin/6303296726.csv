The bad news is that there was no attempt made to correct any of the factual errors in the liners.  No, ""About a Girl,"" ""Breed"" and ""Polly"" aren't from Seattle '92, it's 10/31/91.  No, the songs from Brazil are not from Sao Paulo, but Rio de Janerio.  No, ""Negative Creep"" isn't from '91, but '92.  ""Something In the Way"" isn't from '91 either, but is from '92.  That's an AWFUL lot of mistakes!  The ""With the Lights Out"" box set had all the correct information in there..  I don't understand why there are so many mistakes in these liners.It's also too bad the extras we got are from just one concert, and that being a widely available one.  2 of the 5 songs are available from other perfomances in the proper film, but with the way Nirvana product trickles out, we should be glad we got anything at all.The film itself is brilliant.  I wore my VHS out and this DVD brings back a lot of memories of this powerful and genius band.  They were a force to be reckoned with and will be badly missed.  These live performances are totally exciting and really capture the brief and wonderful moment when Nirvana ruled the world.  The camcorder shots look more grainy then the VHS, but the sound is much improved on and the professionally shot stuff is as sharp as ever.  Hopefully this will pave the way for a video collection, Unplugged, and a DVD of TV appearances from the US and Europe.  The band hung it up 12 years ago.  Give us some product now!Long live Nirvana, forever.

368235,A4LZ4IDYG496U,6303296726,Mo Lindsey,"[45, 48]","This videotape helps you relive the ragged glory that was Nirvana with footage from several of their live concerts mixed with behind-the-scene , foreign news , and home video footage in between the concert footage.Kurt and the boys downplayed their popularity and enjoyed shocking the status qou. Some of the funniest and ironic moments are when Nirvana , unpolished by society's standard , were on these very polished programs like ""Top of the Pops"" and ""Tonight with Jonathan Ross"". The boys displayed their rebelliousness and nerve on these two shows by playing WHAT they wanted to play and singing HOW they wanted to sing. Nirvana was not essentially a commercial band but hit it really big in the mainstream anyway and these two clips showed that they weren't going to compromise their grunge integrity nor take their fame seriously. They did whay they wanted to do and didn't care what people thought. In true rock & roll/punk fashion.The concert footage is terrific , wild , crazed , energetic , funny , and at times disturbing (you can say that , overall , about the tape) from Kurt bashing a stage bouncer in the ear with his guitar and paying the price for it , to a packed stadium crowd wanting Krist Novoselic to shut up and play music(funny) , to Kurt playing a few weary notes on his guitar , dropping to one knee then , quietly , crawling off stage in lingerie. There are two concert clips that might make you cringe but that is part of the shock value of the tape. I won't say what they are but you have been warned.The things that I don't like about the tape is that near the end they use a couple of clips that were previously shown on the tape and some songs are cut midway and jumps or blends into another concert or video clip. Overall the video is very entertaining on several different levels. Its humorously , shockingly , and nostalgically entertaining. You may find yourself watching this video over and over again and rewinding certain parts to look at again. If you want to see this ground-breaking band in their element during the days of ""Nevermind"" then this is the video for you.",5,"LIVE NIRVANA!!

368239,A1OBPHRXHZF8P6,6303296726,"Robin Orlowski ""political activist""","[21, 24]","Initially supposed to be completed by all band members, this project was  released post-humously after Cobain's 1994 suicide. Although it is  provoking to play ""What would it look like if Kurt had lived?""  the actual video is special in it's own way.Both Krist, Dave and  whoever else helped edit the video into it's final form should be commended  for working under such morose circumstances. I honestly do not believe it  was easy for these men. They could have just as easily scrapped the  whole idea without explaination. Considering it came moths after his death,  I am certain I would not be able to do as well.The final project is  as much a history of the band (which was problaly supposed to be it's  original intention) as much as it is a tribute to Cobain.Even if it is  obvious that the video was supposed to be different, one cannot fault the  two men for mourning over their best friend. Too often, our society forgets  that musicians are people too and suject to the same emotions and flaws as  the rest of the population.The raw unreleased footage shows a group of  buddies who just happened to become famous from a hit single. That the  members of Nirvana cared for each other is clearly obvious from this movie  and is very emotionally touching.Also important is the fact that it  revealed members of Nirvana voted in a presidential election. While this  political involvement should not come as a big suprise to die hard Nirvana  fans (who knew of involvement with Rock for Choice, No on Nine and other  campaigns)it would problaly motivate newcomers to get out and change the  system if they perceived something wrong.I do however agree with the  nausea-themed montage. This group of friends was experiencing some conflict  and pressure because of the intense experience with fame and something  would have to give.

368240,AD29KEJMCAD76,6303296726,Samhot,"[61, 62]","I have to admit, at first, I didn't like this too much. It just seemed too messy and disjointed, as some of the live performances of certain tracks are like cut-and-paste collages featuring bits of footage taken from various different concerts and spliced together - sometimes within a single song. But, after watching this quite a few times, I started to appreciate the artistic quality in this -- as well as having fun watching these three in action.This footage was mostly recorded during the 1991-1992 era during the release and popularity of their _Nevermind_ album, and as a result, you aren't going to hear any tracks beyond the _Nevermind_ era (_Incesticide_ was mostly recorded in 1990, but released in 1992, so that really doesn't count.) You get to witness the ""backstage"" or offstage antics of Kurt Cobain, Dave Grohl and Krist Novoselic, and as you witness their tomfoolery, you realize that these three ""weirdos"" were meant for each other, as they seem to be in sync with one another, without intent. You also get to hear their feelings on superstardom, witness some nifty performances and other such stuff.Here's a listing of the live tracks performed on here:(1). Aneurysm. (2). About A Girl. (3). Dive. (4). Love Buzz. (5). Breed. (6). Smells Like Teen Spirit. (7). Negative Creep. (8). Come As You Are. (9). Territorial Pissings. (10). Something In The Way . (11). Lithium. (12). Drain You. (13). Polly. (14). Sliver. (15). On A Plain. (16). Noise (which is basically comprised of bits from ""Endless, Nameless,"" the hidden track on certain copies of _Nevermind_, added with destruction.)Some things worth mentioning are: (1). The performance of ""Something In The Way"" is in a different key than the studio version, as well as being amped-up. (2). During the first clip of the ""Love Buzz"" performance, Kurt dives into the audience, possibly hoping to do some crowd surfing. It gets a little out of hand as the bouncer is trying to keep things organized, but he gets hit in the head by the body of Kurt's guitar quite a few times, which leaves a bit of a gash in the bouncer's head. I'm not sure if Kurt did this on purpose or not. But, after Kurt returns to the stage, the bouncer comes from behind and punches Kurt in the back of his head, and kicks him once. After that, the concert pretty much stops, as Krist comes to Kurt's defense, and soon Dave is seen flying from behind his drum kit to help out as well.(3). Anyone wondering where all those concert clips seen in the video for ""Lithium"" came from, you can find them all on this set. (4). The ending features something Nirvana seemed to love to do: destroy their instruments and equipment. At the end, Krist does a little bit of batting practice - with musical instruments. Kurt chucks his guitar in the air, and when it lands, it breaks in half. Afterwards, Krist picks up the body of Kurt's broken guitar, and uses it as a baseball. He uses his bass as a bat, and chucks the body of the broken guitar in the air and tries to hit it. After a miss on the first shot, he hits on the second shot, and the audience applauds. Some really demented stuff.Enough of my rambling. Case and point: if you're a Nirvana fan, you HAVE to own this. You get to see other sides of the members of Nirvana that you wouldn't have seen elsewhere.
