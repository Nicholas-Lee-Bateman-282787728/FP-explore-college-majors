How is it that, in this same series, the Green Bay Packers and Dallas Cowboys have 10 games a piece on their respective sets.  Why do they get special treatment and the Broncos get the shaft? There are numerous games that could have been added to this collection.  The AFC Championship game featuring the Cleveland Browns featuring ""the drive,"" probably one of the greatest games in NFL history.  What about the Denver vs Kansas City games featuring Joe Montana.  There are at least 10 great games the Broncos participated in and yet here we get 3, does that make sense? I'm very disappointed.  I only hope that the NFL reissues a set with at least 10 Bronco games because right now--this is a disgrace!",1,This is a travesty,1235865600,"03 1, 2009",2009,824,"['Let', 'start', 'first', 'saying', 'love', 'three', 'Bronco', 'games', 'DVD', 'set', 'however', 'only', 'three', 'games', 'How', 'same', 'series', 'Green', 'Bay', 'Packers', 'Dallas', 'Cowboys', 'have', '10', 'games', 'piece', 'respective', 'sets', 'Why', 'do', 'get', 'special', 'treatment', 'Broncos', 'get', 'shaft', 'are', 'numerous', 'games', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'added', 'collection', 'AFC', 'Championship', 'game', 'featuring', 'Cleveland', 'Browns', 'featuring', 'drive', 'probably', 'one', 'greatest', 'games', 'NFL', 'history', 'What', 'Denver', 'vs', 'Kansas', 'City', 'games', 'featuring', 'Joe', 'Montana', 'are', 'least', '10', 'great', 'games', 'Broncos', 'participated', 'yet', 'here', 'get', '3', 'make', 'sense', ""'m"", 'very', 'disappointed', 'only', 'hope', 'NFL', 'set', 'least', '10', 'Bronco', 'games', 'because', 'right', 'now', 'disgrace']",NFL Greatest Games Series: Denver Broncos Greatest Games

He honestly couldn't recall if he'd seen the '77 game, so it was like watching a new game...  But the quality was terrible!  If the NFL worked on restoring the films of these older games, I'd gladly pay more money.  As a 20-something who can't remember football before the 90's, the game was unwatchably fuzzy for me.  It looks terrible on an HDTV, and even the audio is compromised.  You might as well put the first disc in the garbage.However, I bought these discs for the Superbowl games, and they're clear and viewable.  Not a lot of extra junk, no frills, and you're not overpaying.  Until they restore the old film, they might as well just package the 97/98 Superbowls.

We downed gallons of Coors before the game (we were Juniors at Hinckley High in Aurora, for those keeping score in the homeland) and saw a most thrilling game in which Green Bay QB Lynn Dickey had an incredible 371 yards versus 101 by The Greatest One.  The fourth quarter saw an amazing game-saving sack on Dickey by the one and only Rulon Gardner.Again, great DVD collection, but I - along with a sizeable cadre of Bronco fans, the greatest fans in the world -  would love to see the Snow Bowl, The Drive and The Fumble in their entirely on DVDs someday.",4,Great Collection - Where's The 10/15/84 Snow Bowl??,1294272000,"01 6, 2011",2011,967,"['really', 'enjoyed', 'watching', 'collection', 'par', 'most', 'NFL', 'compliations', 'certainly', 'reminiscing', 'three', 'Denver', 'greatest', 'moments', 'agree', 'fellow', 'Bronco', 'fans', 'missing', 'Drive', 'Fumble', 'producer', 'must', 'be', 'Cleveland', 'native', 'course', 'Where', 'legendary', '10/15/84', 'Snow', 'Bowl', '17-14', 'thriller', 'Green', 'Bay', 'was', 'fortunate', 'enough', 'attend', 'buddy', 'downed', 'gallons', 'Coors', 'game', 'were', 'Juniors', 'Hinckley', 'High', 'Aurora', 'keeping', 'score', 'homeland', 'saw', 'most', 'thrilling', 'game', 'Green', 'Bay', 'QB', 'Lynn', 'Dickey', 'had', 'incredible', '371', 'yards', '101', 'Greatest', 'One', 'fourth', 'quarter', 'saw', 'amazing', 'game-saving', 'sack', 'Dickey', 'one', 'only', 'Rulon', 'Gardner.Again', 'great', 'DVD', 'collection', 'sizeable', 'cadre', 'Bronco', 'fans', 'greatest', 'fans', 'world', 'would', 'love', 'see', 'Snow', 'Bowl', 'Drive', 'Fumble', 'entirely', 'DVDs', 'someday']",NFL Greatest Games Series: Denver Broncos Greatest Games

It is very good as far as it goes, but there should be a lot more included in a set entitled, 'Denver Broncos Greatest Games'.Even though it is much less than it could and should be, this is a fun set.

This disk relives that great game with some of the all time greats for both teams including Randy Gradishar, Tom Jackson, Craig Morton, and Haven Moses for the Broncos.  Some of the Raiders' greats (it hurts a Broncos fan to even use those two words together) included are Kenny Stabler, Dave Casper, Lester Hayes, and John Matuszak, along with a much younger coach John Madden.Disk Two contains Super Bowl XXXII, the Broncos first win in the big game against the Green Bay Packers.  There are some very memorable moments, particularly with John Elway and Terrell Davis.  Brett Favre had some great moments in a losing effort.The final game included in this series is Super Bowl XXXIII, which saw the Broncos defeat the Atlanta Falcons for their second consecutive championship.This is a lot of fun.
