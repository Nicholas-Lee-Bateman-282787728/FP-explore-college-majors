369178,A2PBCNUM5BPECC,6303320600,Abbygail,"[1, 7]","I am so glad that Oscar Wilde's genius prose was made into movie form. The cast is excellent. I have always loved John Karlen. I started watching him  when the daytime horror-soap &quot;Dark Shadows&quot; was popular. He,  along with Shane and Nigel, give a too true- to- life portrayal of Wilde's  mixed characters battling their own curses and demons that life seemingly  has bestowed upon them. However, it is not exactly circumstances which mold  us into who we are, but our choices and how we handle conflict. I had one  of my English classes watch this movie so that they could see that  everything we do and say eventually makes us who we are, and we can never  undo or repair the damages of ill deeds, greed or lust. It's a frightening  thought. Sometimes it's more difficult to take the hard right than it is to  take the easy wrong, as Al Gore so brilliantly suggested in his 2000  Democratic Convention speech. The fact that man would literally sell his  soul for youth teaches us that our priorities are still out of order. The  conflict of man versus himself is the power point of this book/movie.  Sometimes we truly are our own worst enemies. While the character Dorian  continues to do as he pleases despite hurting others, his portrait changes,  grows old and reveals all of his past sins. This effect is pure genius, and  it really makes one stop and think about his/her own life and choices.  Everyone should watch this movie at least once a month....it's that  powerful and meaningful. I also believe that Oscar Wilde saw himself in  many of his characters. He had a difficult life along with the world  judging him harshly, but he too made choices that cost him everything. In  conclusion, sometimes the hardest thing in the world is self-reflection.",5,&quot;Could It Be Oscar Wilde's Tortured Soul?&quot;,967420800,"08 28, 2000",2000,1771,"['am', 'so', 'glad', 'Oscar', 'Wilde', 'genius', 'prose', 'was', 'made', 'movie', 'form', 'cast', 'excellent', 'have', 'always', 'loved', 'John', 'Karlen', 'started', 'watching', 'when', 'daytime', 'horror-soap', 'quot', 'Dark', 'Shadows', 'quot', 'was', 'popular', 'Shane', 'Nigel', 'give', 'too', 'true-', 'to-', 'life', 'portrayal', 'Wilde', 'mixed', 'characters', 'battling', 'own', 'curses', 'demons', 'life', 'seemingly', 'bestowed', 'However', 'not', 'exactly', 'circumstances', 'mold', 'who', 'are', 'choices', 'how', 'handle', 'conflict', 'had', 'one', 'English', 'classes', 'watch', 'movie', 'so', 'could', 'see', 'everything', 'do', 'say', 'eventually', 'who', 'are', 'can', 'never', 'undo', 'repair', 'damages', 'ill', 'deeds', 'greed', 'lust', 'frightening', 'thought', 'more', 'difficult', 'take', 'hard', 'right', 'take', 'easy', 'wrong', 'Al', 'Gore', 'so', 'brilliantly', 'suggested', '2000', 'Democratic', 'Convention', 'speech', 'fact', 'man', 'would', 'literally', 'sell', 'soul', 'youth', 'teaches', 'priorities', 'are', 'still', 'order', 'conflict', 'man', 'versus', 'power', 'point', 'book/movie', 'Sometimes', 'truly', 'are', 'own', 'worst', 'enemies', 'character', 'Dorian', 'do', 'hurting', 'others', 'portrait', 'changes', 'old', 'past', 'sins', 'effect', 'pure', 'genius', 'really', 'one', 'stop', 'think', 'his/her', 'own', 'life', 'choices', 'Everyone', 'should', 'watch', 'movie', 'least', 'once', 'month', '.it', 'powerful', 'meaningful', 'also', 'believe', 'Oscar', 'Wilde', 'saw', 'many', 'characters', 'had', 'difficult', 'life', 'world', 'judging', 'harshly', 'too', 'made', 'choices', 'cost', 'everything', 'conclusion', 'sometimes', 'hardest', 'thing', 'world', 'self-reflection']",Picture of Dorian Gray VHS
369179,A23QOAXJSWIBS6,6303320600,"Daniel S. Russell ""syzygy121""","[26, 28]","Leaving aside audio issues, which are there, not imagined, this adaptation of Oscar Wilde's novella leaves many other things to be desired.Not only does the screenplay and eerie soundtrack lend an ominous, ""Dark Shadows"" feel to the proceedings, there has been a concerted effort to downplay the homo-erotic subtext of Wilde's work.  Gray is transformed into a Jack-the-Ripperesque, Jeckel and Hyde figure, preying on women, living the life of a rock-star or playboy.  Shane Briant does have a bit of a Freddie Mercury/David Bowie quality about him, but any suggestion that he might be involved with other men is minimized to a few lingering glances and innuendo.Without Wilde's subtext, some plot points and characters no longer make sense.  Here Sybil kills herself because Gray deflowers her and then abandons her -- in the text it is a split over aesthetics in a much more profound and psychological encounter.  This Gray is simply an insensitive cad, not worthy of the picture becoming so twisted.  Wilde's Gray is a self-consumed aesthete who tires of people and throws them aside when he becomes disillusioned.  This is far more damning to one's soul.The tell-tale test for me was the handling of Alan Campbell. Compare this rendering with that of the BBC version just three years later.  Again this one doesn't make much sense.  Nor does the relationship with Beatrice, again I feel as an attempt to ""straighten up"" Dorian.Certainly this production is more ambitious than the BBC version, including remote shots and crowd scenes, but what good are production values when the script is fatally flawed and the mood is reduced to melodramatic horror.Watch the BBC version with John Gielgud and the far superior Peter Firth.  Not only is that cast more attractive and has a better grasp of the work, it's to be chosen primarily if you want to come anywhere near Wilde's spirit and intention.",2,"The ""straightening up"" of Dorian Gray",1112918400,"04 8, 2005",2005,1895,"['Leaving', 'aside', 'audio', 'issues', 'are', 'there', 'not', 'imagined', 'adaptation', 'Oscar', 'Wilde', 'novella', 'many', 'other', 'things', 'be', 'desired.Not', 'only', 'screenplay', 'eerie', 'soundtrack', 'lend', 'ominous', 'Dark', 'Shadows', 'feel', 'proceedings', 'been', 'concerted', 'effort', 'downplay', 'homo-erotic', 'subtext', 'Wilde', 'work', 'Gray', 'transformed', 'Jack-the-Ripperesque', 'Jeckel', 'Hyde', 'figure', 'preying', 'women', 'living', 'life', 'rock-star', 'playboy', 'Shane', 'Briant', 'have', 'bit', 'Freddie', 'Mercury/David', 'Bowie', 'quality', 'suggestion', 'might', 'be', 'involved', 'other', 'men', 'minimized', 'few', 'lingering', 'glances', 'innuendo.Without', 'Wilde', 'subtext', 'plot', 'points', 'characters', 'no', 'longer', 'make', 'sense', 'Here', 'Sybil', 'Gray', 'then', 'text', 'split', 'aesthetics', 'much', 'more', 'profound', 'psychological', 'encounter', 'Gray', 'simply', 'insensitive', 'cad', 'not', 'worthy', 'picture', 'becoming', 'so', 'twisted', 'Wilde', 'Gray', 'self-consumed', 'aesthete', 'who', 'people', 'aside', 'when', 'disillusioned', 'far', 'more', 'damning', 'one', 'soul.The', 'tell-tale', 'test', 'was', 'handling', 'Alan', 'Campbell', 'Compare', 'rendering', 'BBC', 'version', 'just', 'three', 'years', 'later', 'Again', 'one', ""n't"", 'make', 'much', 'sense', 'relationship', 'Beatrice', 'again', 'feel', 'attempt', 'straighten', 'up', 'Dorian.Certainly', 'production', 'more', 'ambitious', 'BBC', 'version', 'including', 'remote', 'shots', 'crowd', 'scenes', 'what', 'good', 'are', 'production', 'values', 'when', 'script', 'fatally', 'flawed', 'mood', 'reduced', 'melodramatic', 'horror.Watch', 'BBC', 'version', 'John', 'Gielgud', 'far', 'superior', 'Peter', 'Firth', 'Not', 'only', 'cast', 'more', 'attractive', 'better', 'grasp', 'work', 'be', 'chosen', 'primarily', 'want', 'come', 'anywhere', 'Wilde', 'spirit', 'intention']",Picture of Dorian Gray VHS

369186,A3UDYY6L2NH3JS,6303320600,"Jacques COULARDEAU ""A soul doctor, so to say""","[0, 0]","He who does not know Oscar Wilde is just uneducated. He who does not know Oscar Wilde's ""The Picture of Dorian Gray"" is just half human. And any film adapted from Oscar Wilde's stories and plays are a must for any man in this world. I did say man because Oscar Wilde is talking to men about men, and even when he is dealing with women he is addressing men as his privileged audience.Oscar Wilde was at least bisexual and being Irish and not of noble extract, his gay adventure with the son of an English Lord cost him several years in the prison of Reading. More for than ""perverting"" the son of a lord and future lord himself, and that son remained attached to Oscar Wilde and his work till the end of his life, Oscar Wilde was punished because of the social line of nobility he crossed up, which was unacceptable at the time in England, and will be till the 1980s or so. What's more he dared cross the national divide from Irish to English in his sexual love life and that was a tremendously lot less acceptable than trespassing the first nobility divide, and probably still is or was till at least the beginning of the 21st century.So this film has to be seen as a fundamental film as for dealing with ""perversion"" and ""perdition"" in English society. The film is discrete about the gay side of things, but a long list of men are said toward the end of the film to refuse to have anything to do any more with Dorian Gray or to step out of a room when Dorian Gray steps in it. That discretion is not important anyway since what is at stake is a lot more than just gayness.Dorian Gray is young, about 20 at the beginning, and rich, at the beginning again since he will grow poor as years go by. He will be 41 at the end. During those 20 years or so he will do all the villainies and treacheries you can imagine, with women or with men, among other things breaking the hearts of women and leading them to their death or plainly killing men or blackmailing some others like the professor and doctor he uses to get rid of the corpse of his last victim, using the professor's liking men to force him to do something absolutely unethical and make him his accomplice in this crime.But the appealing and disquieting knack of the novel and the film is the fact that the picture that was done by a famous painter when Dorian Gray was 20 leads Dorian to wishing the painting to age while he himself does not. So at age 41 he is still looking the way he did when 20 and the portrait, hidden away from public view is aging for one and changing in agreement with the horrors Dorian Gray does.At the end what has to happen happens: Dorian Gray wants to destroy the painting and instead it is him who dies and the curse on the painting reverts itself and Dorian Gray when dead looks his age and carries his horrendous soul ugliness on his face.But the film reduced to this story line is in fact rather simple and would at best be a horror short story, and in fact was used several times here and there in horror literature. This film and the story behind are not horror literature but deep ethical literature. Oscar Wilde denounces the hypocrisy of English society: ""The value of an idea has nothing to do with the sincerity of the man who expresses it."" One can utter the most profound moral statements and yet be the most rotten character on earth. His rotten nature does not in any way degrade the ethical value of the moral statements he proclaims.In simple words ""those who go beneath the surface do so at their peril."" The real theme of the novel is the fact that the surface of things means nothing and that the true nature of a man is beneath his appearance. Note the well chosen ""beneath."" Oscar Wilde is careful not to use ""behind"" that would not mean a lower level or state. For Oscar Wilde the social world is a superficial appearance and a lower true reality. The appearance is the top surface of things and truth is necessarily underneath. The aristocracy that is at the top of society does not hide a shadow that is at their level but hides an ugliness that is necessarily deep under that aristocratic top surface. Aristocratic societies are necessarily hypocritical and pushing their roots in some deep mud or filth.Though this is the fundamental idea in the story, Oscar Wilde cannot resist expressing another one he borrowed from Shakespeare. ""Time is jealous of you. Time will have his revenge."" This time is the time Shakespeare describes and despises in his sonnets but with a Macbethian dimension to it. Time is the all leveller but by bringing everything superior down into the muddy pit of human manure.I will only regret one thing about this film. The actor who plays Dorian Gray is slightly stiff and not directed into some kind of real attractiveness. He may be handsome but he is also tremendously cold or artificial.Dr Jacques COULARDEAU",4,The main actor is too shallow,1343692800,"07 31, 2012",2012,4851,"['who', 'not', 'know', 'Oscar', 'Wilde', 'just', 'uneducated', 'who', 'not', 'know', 'Oscar', 'Wilde', 'Picture', 'Dorian', 'Gray', 'just', 'half', 'human', 'film', 'adapted', 'Oscar', 'Wilde', 'stories', 'plays', 'are', 'must', 'man', 'world', 'did', 'say', 'man', 'Oscar', 'Wilde', 'talking', 'men', 'men', 'even', 'when', 'dealing', 'women', 'addressing', 'men', 'privileged', 'audience.Oscar', 'Wilde', 'was', 'least', 'bisexual', 'being', 'Irish', 'not', 'noble', 'extract', 'gay', 'adventure', 'son', 'English', 'Lord', 'cost', 'several', 'years', 'prison', 'Reading', 'More', 'perverting', 'son', 'lord', 'future', 'lord', 'son', 'remained', 'attached', 'Oscar', 'Wilde', 'work', 'till', 'end', 'life', 'Oscar', 'Wilde', 'was', 'punished', 'social', 'line', 'nobility', 'crossed', 'up', 'was', 'unacceptable', 'time', 'England', 'will', 'be', 'till', '1980s', 'so', 'What', 'more', 'dared', 'cross', 'national', 'divide', 'Irish', 'English', 'sexual', 'love', 'life', 'was', 'tremendously', 'lot', 'less', 'acceptable', 'trespassing', 'first', 'nobility', 'divide', 'probably', 'still', 'was', 'till', 'least', 'beginning', '21st', 'century.So', 'film', 'be', 'seen', 'fundamental', 'film', 'dealing', 'perversion', 'perdition', 'English', 'society', 'film', 'discrete', 'gay', 'side', 'things', 'long', 'list', 'men', 'are', 'said', 'end', 'film', 'refuse', 'have', 'anything', 'do', 'more', 'Dorian', 'Gray', 'step', 'out', 'room', 'when', 'Dorian', 'Gray', 'steps', 'discretion', 'not', 'important', 'anyway', 'what', 'stake', 'lot', 'more', 'just', 'gayness.Dorian', 'Gray', 'young', 'about', '20', 'beginning', 'rich', 'beginning', 'again', 'will', 'grow', 'poor', 'years', 'go', 'will', 'be', '41', 'end', '20', 'years', 'so', 'will', 'do', 'villainies', 'treacheries', 'can', 'imagine', 'women', 'men', 'other', 'things', 'breaking', 'hearts', 'women', 'leading', 'death', 'plainly', 'killing', 'men', 'blackmailing', 'others', 'professor', 'doctor', 'get', 'rid', 'corpse', 'last', 'victim', 'using', 'professor', 'liking', 'men', 'force', 'do', 'something', 'absolutely', 'unethical', 'make', 'accomplice', 'crime.But', 'appealing', 'disquieting', 'knack', 'novel', 'film', 'fact', 'picture', 'was', 'done', 'famous', 'painter', 'when', 'Dorian', 'Gray', 'was', '20', 'leads', 'Dorian', 'wishing', 'painting', 'age', 'not', 'So', 'age', '41', 'still', 'looking', 'way', 'did', 'when', '20', 'portrait', 'hidden', 'away', 'public', 'view', 'aging', 'one', 'changing', 'agreement', 'horrors', 'Dorian', 'Gray', 'does.At', 'end', 'happen', 'happens', 'Dorian', 'Gray', 'destroy', 'painting', 'instead', 'who', 'curse', 'painting', 'Dorian', 'Gray', 'when', 'dead', 'age', 'horrendous', 'soul', 'ugliness', 'face.But', 'film', 'reduced', 'story', 'line', 'fact', 'rather', 'simple', 'would', 'best', 'be', 'horror', 'short', 'story', 'fact', 'was', 'used', 'several', 'times', 'here', 'there', 'horror', 'literature', 'film', 'story', 'behind', 'are', 'not', 'horror', 'literature', 'deep', 'ethical', 'literature', 'Oscar', 'Wilde', 'hypocrisy', 'English', 'society', 'value', 'idea', 'nothing', 'do', 'sincerity', 'man', 'who', 'One', 'can', 'utter', 'most', 'profound', 'moral', 'statements', 'yet', 'be', 'most', 'rotten', 'character', 'earth', 'rotten', 'nature', 'not', 'way', 'degrade', 'ethical', 'value', 'moral', 'statements', 'proclaims.In', 'simple', 'words', 'who', 'go', 'surface', 'do', 'so', 'peril', 'real', 'theme', 'novel', 'fact', 'surface', 'things', 'means', 'nothing', 'true', 'nature', 'man', 'appearance', 'Note', 'well', 'chosen', 'beneath', 'Oscar', 'Wilde', 'careful', 'not', 'use', 'would', 'not', 'mean', 'lower', 'level', 'state', 'Oscar', 'Wilde', 'social', 'world', 'superficial', 'appearance', 'lower', 'true', 'reality', 'appearance', 'top', 'surface', 'things', 'truth', 'necessarily', 'underneath', 'aristocracy', 'top', 'society', 'not', 'hide', 'shadow', 'level', 'ugliness', 'necessarily', 'deep', 'aristocratic', 'top', 'surface', 'Aristocratic', 'societies', 'are', 'necessarily', 'hypocritical', 'pushing', 'roots', 'deep', 'mud', 'filth.Though', 'fundamental', 'idea', 'story', 'Oscar', 'Wilde', 'can', 'not', 'resist', 'expressing', 'one', 'borrowed', 'Shakespeare', 'Time', 'jealous', 'Time', 'will', 'have', 'revenge', 'time', 'time', 'Shakespeare', 'describes', 'despises', 'sonnets', 'Macbethian', 'dimension', 'Time', 'leveller', 'bringing', 'everything', 'superior', 'down', 'muddy', 'pit', 'human', 'manure.I', 'will', 'only', 'regret', 'one', 'thing', 'film', 'actor', 'who', 'Dorian', 'Gray', 'slightly', 'stiff', 'not', 'directed', 'kind', 'real', 'attractiveness', 'may', 'be', 'handsome', 'also', 'tremendously', 'cold', 'artificial.Dr', 'Jacques', 'COULARDEAU']",Picture of Dorian Gray VHS

369188,A2FE1BXPJ1RJ9S,6303320600,J. Jossa,"[0, 0]","Like many other people, I saw this movie when it came out in 1973.  I was a huge fan of ""Dark Shadows,"" which was another Dan Curtis Production and I was interested in seeing his version of Oscar Wilde's story.  This version of the Picture of Dorian Gray was ""tastefully"" done compared to Gothic horror films since. Possibly this could be due to the time it was filmed. The actions of the character, Dorian Gray, were more inuendo and not blatantly in your face.  Some sexual excapades were obvious (like his night with Sybil Vane), while other references to pedophilia, homosexuality, and other liasons were hinted. As a result, I appreciated the frightening aspects of hiding his double life and seeing this as a moral tale demonstrating how that life caught up with the character.  I was a teacher at one point in my existence and would have my students read the book BEFORE viewing a film based on the material in that book.  The reason I did that was due to a problem I felt all film makers have when making any film.  They either add to or take away some of the finer points an author writes about when creating a story.  As a result, some of these films lose the original author's intent.  As a classroom tool, reading the book and viewing a film made it easier to compare and constrast the two.  But I always encouraged my students to read the book FIRST, this gave them a better basis to approach both the book and a film.The quality of the DVD was fine; it played on my Blueray player. The film has decent sound (I don't think it was supposed to have a surround sound.) Two scenes in the film were slightly discolored possibily because of the age of the film.  Overall, it was great seeing this film after almost 40 years.",4,A Moral Tale,1301097600,"03 26, 2011",2011,1732,"['many', 'other', 'people', 'saw', 'movie', 'when', 'came', 'out', '1973', 'was', 'huge', 'fan', 'Dark', 'Shadows', 'was', 'Dan', 'Curtis', 'Production', 'was', 'interested', 'seeing', 'version', 'Oscar', 'Wilde', 'story', 'version', 'Picture', 'Dorian', 'Gray', 'was', 'tastefully', 'done', 'compared', 'Gothic', 'horror', 'films', 'Possibly', 'could', 'be', 'due', 'time', 'was', 'filmed', 'actions', 'character', 'Dorian', 'Gray', 'were', 'more', 'inuendo', 'not', 'blatantly', 'face', 'sexual', 'excapades', 'were', 'obvious', 'night', 'Sybil', 'Vane', 'other', 'references', 'pedophilia', 'homosexuality', 'other', 'liasons', 'were', 'hinted', 'result', 'appreciated', 'frightening', 'aspects', 'hiding', 'double', 'life', 'seeing', 'moral', 'tale', 'demonstrating', 'how', 'life', 'caught', 'up', 'character', 'was', 'teacher', 'one', 'point', 'existence', 'would', 'have', 'students', 'read', 'book', 'viewing', 'film', 'based', 'material', 'book', 'reason', 'did', 'was', 'due', 'problem', 'felt', 'film', 'makers', 'have', 'when', 'making', 'film', 'add', 'take', 'away', 'finer', 'points', 'author', 'when', 'creating', 'story', 'result', 'films', 'lose', 'original', 'author', 'intent', 'classroom', 'tool', 'reading', 'book', 'viewing', 'film', 'made', 'easier', 'compare', 'constrast', 'two', 'always', 'encouraged', 'students', 'read', 'book', 'FIRST', 'gave', 'better', 'basis', 'approach', 'book', 'film.The', 'quality', 'DVD', 'was', 'fine', 'played', 'Blueray', 'player', 'film', 'decent', 'sound', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'was', 'supposed', 'have', 'surround', 'sound', 'Two', 'scenes', 'film', 'were', 'slightly', 'discolored', 'possibily', 'age', 'film', 'Overall', 'was', 'great', 'seeing', 'film', 'almost', '40', 'years']",Picture of Dorian Gray VHS

This appears to be a rather low budget film judging by the sets and clothes (Dorian doesn't redecorate once in 20 years - and his wallpaper never fades either).Dorian Grey is having his portrait done by Basil, not sure of the relationship if any, when an old, rather dissolute friend of Basil's drops by, and bends the tender ear of Dorian with his tales of a life of fun, and how youth is the only thing worth having. This leads the weak-minded Dorian to proclaim to his portrait that he would give his soul to stay young, if only the portrait would age, and he wouldn't.  He gets his wish....Dorian falls in love with Sybil and wants to marry her, but when this friend advises him to ask her to his house and spend the night, even though she wants to wait until they are married, Dorian, for some unknown reason, decides to heed his advice.  Once he has her, of course, he no longer wants her, and she commits suicide.  Dorian goes on to become completely cold-blooded once this happens.  He's truly an annoying little man.  He proceeds to gamble, have affairs with men and women, and pays for sex with a child.  He also murders.  He also lies in bed tearing off one tiny scrap of toast at a time, then buttering, then putting jelly on the piece, eating it, then repeating the entire process with another tiny piece!  He does this with about 12 pieces and I would have murdered him myself for it! Just put butter and jelly on one slice of toast and eat it!In any case, Dorian's picture gets gorier and gorier, and even though at one point he hired a handyman to board up the nursery door where the portrait resides, it appears that after that the door to the room is still unimpeded and works as well as ever.  It's at the top of about 10 stairs (which take each person about 5 minutes to get up the last 5 - I had to fast forward this every time).  Dorian likes to visit his picture now and then because he thinks that if he does something good, it will show up in the picture.  However, it just gets worse and worse, so he thinks he might as well continue with his bad ways.  You wonder why he didn't just burn the picture.Basically, Dorian was a boring, self-centered rich guy, who was not a good person to begin with or none of this would ever have happened.",2,I Borrowed the VHS Copy From the Library,1120521600,"07 5, 2005",2005,2334,"['picture', 'sound', 'were', 'great', 'did', ""n't"", 'miss', 'much', 'be', 'rather', 'low', 'budget', 'film', 'judging', 'sets', 'clothes', 'Dorian', ""n't"", 'redecorate', 'once', '20', 'years', 'wallpaper', 'never', '.Dorian', 'Grey', 'having', 'portrait', 'done', 'Basil', 'not', 'sure', 'relationship', 'when', 'old', 'rather', 'dissolute', 'friend', 'Basil', 'drops', 'tender', 'ear', 'Dorian', 'tales', 'life', 'fun', 'how', 'youth', 'only', 'thing', 'worth', 'having', 'weak-minded', 'Dorian', 'proclaim', 'portrait', 'would', 'give', 'soul', 'stay', 'young', 'only', 'portrait', 'would', 'age', 'would', ""n't"", 'wish', '.Dorian', 'falls', 'love', 'Sybil', 'marry', 'when', 'friend', 'ask', 'house', 'spend', 'night', 'even', 'wait', 'are', 'married', 'Dorian', 'unknown', 'reason', 'heed', 'advice', 'Once', 'course', 'no', 'longer', 'suicide', 'Dorian', 'become', 'completely', 'cold-blooded', 'once', 'truly', 'annoying', 'little', 'man', 'gamble', 'have', 'affairs', 'men', 'women', 'pays', 'sex', 'child', 'also', 'also', 'bed', 'tearing', 'off', 'one', 'tiny', 'scrap', 'toast', 'time', 'then', 'buttering', 'then', 'putting', 'jelly', 'piece', 'eating', 'then', 'repeating', 'entire', 'process', 'tiny', 'piece', 'about', '12', 'pieces', 'would', 'have', 'murdered', 'Just', 'put', 'butter', 'jelly', 'one', 'slice', 'toast', 'eat', 'case', 'Dorian', 'picture', 'gorier', 'gorier', 'even', 'one', 'point', 'hired', 'handyman', 'board', 'up', 'nursery', 'door', 'where', 'portrait', 'door', 'room', 'still', 'unimpeded', 'as', 'well', 'ever', 'top', 'about', '10', 'stairs', 'take', 'person', '5', 'minutes', 'get', 'up', 'last', '5', 'had', 'fast', 'forward', 'time', 'Dorian', 'likes', 'visit', 'picture', 'now', 'then', 'something', 'good', 'will', 'show', 'up', 'picture', 'However', 'just', 'worse', 'worse', 'might', 'as', 'well', 'continue', 'bad', 'ways', 'wonder', 'why', 'did', ""n't"", 'just', 'burn', 'picture.Basically', 'Dorian', 'was', 'boring', 'self-centered', 'rich', 'guy', 'who', 'was', 'not', 'good', 'person', 'begin', 'none', 'would', 'ever', 'have', 'happened']",Picture of Dorian Gray VHS
