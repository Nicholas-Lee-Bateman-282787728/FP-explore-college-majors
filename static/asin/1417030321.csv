172340,A1ALOIPRR8Q06J,1417030321,"2 cents ""meaningless memes""","[7, 8]","A couple years ago I was staying with family that has digital cable. Let me digress: Ever read _Amusing Ourselves to Death: Public Discourse in the Age of Show Business_by Neil Postman? It's worth checking out. Anyway, I was hanging around the house a lot and this movie was playing on the HBO channels. At first I wasn't too interested to be honest. You know, seemed it might be a liberal Hollywood ""message movie"" and the subject matter didn't particularly appeal to me. I mean romance movies aren't my thing anyway and one about two dudes is just not my cup of tea. And there was so much buzz around it cause it's the ""gay cowboy movie"" and people are retarded and trip, in large part because of the very entertainment industry TV shows and magazines that are mainly responsible for generating the publicity for Hollywood products. But I started catching parts of it when I was hanging out channel surfing and ended up seeing the whole thing. ANYWAY, this is a very good movie, plain and simple. I was moved by it alright? I mean it got to me. And I made a point to tell friends. It bothered me that I felt even slightly funny about telling people I know that I liked the movie. I called BS on myself.The motivation for writing this here Amazon ""review"" for BROKEBACK MOUNTAIN is Heath Ledger's performance.Seeing Ledger in this role it was perfectly clear to me at the time that Ledger was going to be one of his generation's finest actors. I've heard from fanboys a million times over how awesome Ledger's performance as The Joker is and it really is an amazing performance and I completely agree. However, long before ever seeing THE DARK KNIGHT I knew Heath Ledger was going to be a superstar. I knew well before ever even seeing a clip of him as The Joker he was going to be great as The Joker solely based on his performance in this film and that THE DARK KNIGHT would make him a star.I'd also add that BROKEBACK MOUNTAIN is a much better pictire than CRASH which won for ""Best Picture"" that year. Ang Lee is a truly great drama film director. ICE STORM and RIDE WITH THE DEVIL are also great and unique films. The tribute below is touching and I think perfectly articulates what so many have thought and felt..___________________________________________________________________""Ledger's magnificent performance is an acting miracle. He seems to tear it from his insides. Ledger doesn't just know how Ennis moves, speaks and listens; he knows how he breathes. To see him inhale the scent of a shirt hanging in Jack's closet is to take measure of the pain of love lost.Rare is the performance that can honestly be called a ""revelation,"" but that's what it felt like to watch Heath Ledger in ""Brokeback Mountain."" Not only did he bring iconic life and nuance to the existential loneliness of Ennis Del Mar, a taciturn but complex (and conflicted) character, but for such mature work to spring from the teen-idol star of ""10 Things I Hate About You"" and ""A Knight's Tale"" was... well, revelatory itself -- the astonishing revelation of a suddenly, fully developed actor whose juvenile efforts scarcely hinted he'd be capable of such moving depth and clarity. Ledger emerged as if from a cocoon, gleaming with promise and flexing his wings.Only two years after he received his first Oscar nomination for this iconic, star-making performance, it seems unthinkable that we should be mourning his death, at the age of 28....""-- outstanding film critic Jim Emerson.Couldn't say it better.",5,You want to talk about great acting?,1219968000,"08 29, 2008",2008,3489,"['couple', 'years', 'was', 'staying', 'family', 'digital', 'cable', 'Let', 'digress', 'Ever', 'read', '_Amusing', 'Death', 'Public', 'Discourse', 'Age', 'Show', 'Business_by', 'Neil', 'Postman', 'worth', 'checking', 'out', 'Anyway', 'was', 'hanging', 'house', 'lot', 'movie', 'was', 'playing', 'HBO', 'channels', 'first', 'was', ""n't"", 'too', 'interested', 'be', 'honest', 'know', 'seemed', 'might', 'be', 'liberal', 'Hollywood', 'message', 'movie', 'subject', 'matter', 'did', ""n't"", 'particularly', 'appeal', 'mean', 'romance', 'movies', 'are', ""n't"", 'thing', 'anyway', 'one', 'two', 'dudes', 'just', 'not', 'cup', 'tea', 'was', 'so', 'much', 'buzz', 'gay', 'cowboy', 'movie', 'people', 'are', 'retarded', 'trip', 'large', 'part', 'very', 'entertainment', 'industry', 'TV', 'shows', 'magazines', 'are', 'mainly', 'responsible', 'generating', 'publicity', 'Hollywood', 'products', 'started', 'catching', 'parts', 'when', 'was', 'hanging', 'out', 'channel', 'surfing', 'ended', 'up', 'seeing', 'whole', 'thing', 'ANYWAY', 'very', 'good', 'movie', 'plain', 'simple', 'was', 'moved', 'alright', 'mean', 'got', 'made', 'point', 'tell', 'friends', 'bothered', 'felt', 'even', 'slightly', 'funny', 'telling', 'people', 'know', 'liked', 'movie', 'called', 'BS', 'myself.The', 'motivation', 'writing', 'here', 'Amazon', 'review', 'BROKEBACK', 'MOUNTAIN', 'Heath', 'Ledger', 'performance.Seeing', 'Ledger', 'role', 'was', 'perfectly', 'clear', 'time', 'Ledger', 'was', 'going', 'be', 'one', 'generation', 'finest', 'actors', ""'ve"", 'heard', 'fanboys', 'million', 'times', 'how', 'awesome', 'Ledger', 'performance', 'Joker', 'really', 'amazing', 'performance', 'completely', 'agree', 'However', 'long', 'ever', 'seeing', 'THE', 'DARK', 'KNIGHT', 'knew', 'Heath', 'Ledger', 'was', 'going', 'be', 'superstar', 'knew', 'well', 'ever', 'even', 'seeing', 'clip', 'Joker', 'was', 'going', 'be', 'great', 'Joker', 'solely', 'based', 'performance', 'film', 'THE', 'DARK', 'KNIGHT', 'would', 'make', 'star.I', ""'d"", 'also', 'add', 'BROKEBACK', 'MOUNTAIN', 'much', 'better', 'pictire', 'CRASH', 'won', 'Best', 'Picture', 'year', 'Ang', 'Lee', 'truly', 'great', 'drama', 'film', 'director', 'ICE', 'STORM', 'RIDE', 'WITH', 'THE', 'DEVIL', 'are', 'also', 'great', 'unique', 'films', 'tribute', 'below', 'touching', 'think', 'perfectly', 'what', 'so', 'many', 'have', 'thought', 'felt..___________________________________________________________________', 'Ledger', 'magnificent', 'performance', 'acting', 'miracle', 'tear', 'insides', 'Ledger', ""n't"", 'just', 'know', 'how', 'Ennis', 'speaks', 'listens', 'how', 'see', 'inhale', 'scent', 'shirt', 'hanging', 'Jack', 'closet', 'take', 'measure', 'pain', 'love', 'lost.Rare', 'performance', 'can', 'honestly', 'be', 'called', 'revelation', 'what', 'felt', 'watch', 'Heath', 'Ledger', 'Brokeback', 'Mountain', 'Not', 'only', 'did', 'bring', 'iconic', 'life', 'nuance', 'existential', 'loneliness', 'Ennis', 'Del', 'Mar', 'taciturn', 'complex', 'conflicted', 'character', 'such', 'mature', 'work', 'spring', 'teen-idol', 'star', '10', 'Things', 'Hate', 'A', 'Knight', 'Tale', 'was', 'well', 'revelatory', 'astonishing', 'revelation', 'suddenly', 'fully', 'developed', 'actor', 'juvenile', 'efforts', 'scarcely', 'hinted', ""'d"", 'be', 'capable', 'such', 'moving', 'depth', 'clarity', 'Ledger', 'emerged', 'cocoon', 'gleaming', 'promise', 'flexing', 'wings.Only', 'two', 'years', 'received', 'first', 'Oscar', 'nomination', 'iconic', 'star-making', 'performance', 'unthinkable', 'should', 'be', 'mourning', 'death', 'age', '28', 'outstanding', 'film', 'critic', 'Jim', 'Emerson.Could', ""n't"", 'say', 'better']",N/A
172341,A1O005WUQUF1K9,1417030321,Aaron Scott,"[25, 48]","Okay--I LIVE in Wyoming, and first off, there are just too many cowboy hats. Here is a great irony: this movie tries to overcome stereotypes about gays, when the movie is 80% stereotype itself (read on--I still loved it--I just want to set the record straight).  It's so ridiculous.  Did Ang Lee even visit Wyoming?  Or just drive through to Alberta imagining every stereotype possible?  You just don't see that many cowboy hats (admittedly, I wear one, nearly alone among any neighbors or coworkers), whereas in the movie hardly anybody doesn't wear one.  And frankly, I don't know where they got the dialog coach (not from Wyoming, certainly) but few people in Wyoming have discernable accents, either, any more than any western state.  You might hear Spanish accents, Greek, even Italian any place in the state, but not that thick drawl that sounds more like somebody playing an old record too slow.Secondly, though this does not relate to stereotype but my own sense of taste, if Ang Lee had omitted the sex scene--or at least done it with discretion and omitted the nearly pornographic detail--the movie might have been an order of magnitude better.That said: gosh, I love it; I've seen it a bazillion times and even surfeit cannot drive the haunting melancholy from my mind.  I wouldn't recommend it to anybody unless they already knew what they were getting in to--it is by no means a FAMILY movie--but it plucked a strong chord with me.  I bought it as soon as it was out on DVD and have watched it (or portions thereof) nearly every night.  Painful, lovely, haunting--I have a new adjective after every viewing--but, like Jack said, I simply cannot quit it.  I wake in the night with lines or music from it in my mind.

172342,AQUU8S55JGY2H,1417030321,Aco,"[9, 13]","This is a superbly haunting film, one so affecting that I woke up in the middle of the night thinking about it. Beautifully acted, directed, scored, shot, located and heart-wrenching, Brokeback Mountain is likely the Best Picture of 2005. Both Heath Ledger and Jake Gyllenhaal give career best performances, creating portraits of two men in love, but distinctly different in their capacity to understand and accept what has happened between them, and particularly who they are.Ang Lee is truly one of cinema's best directors, who's deft handling of different genres (American comic book mythology, sublime Chinese martial arts ballet, 70's era suburban East Coast drama, 19th century pastoral English romance, etc.) continues here. He uses the contrasts of stunning wide open space and isolation, physical and internal isolation. The need to battle the elements alone versus together. The attempt to mask and repress the heart with tradition, denying the rebel. There is also much metaphor to express the opposing natures of men and women. For example, Jack's (Gyllenhaal) evolving submission to his father-in-law is developed over a few scenes, ending in a relieving turkey cutting scene that clarifies his maturity and acceptance of himself. But the moving images of Ennis (Ledger) alone, in stoned paralysis are what haunts the film. His disconnect with what he feels propels the story, his fear and uncontrollable passion wreak havoc on others too, but mostly on himself. Ennis is the romantic and the pragmatic of the two, and tortured by a true love he can't accept. While Jack is the flamboyant and hopeful one, who's sexuality he learns to embrace.But homosexuality is secondary in the film. And just as time period is (it starts in 1963 and travels 20 years) important, it represents a time when cowboys (America's mythic man) were dying out; the residents of ghost towns, made up of young guys needing to be their fathers, etc. To which the differences between Ennis and Jack also evolve. One remaining the ranch hand/herder, the other going into business and wealth.But the timelessness of this is primarily in the relationship itself, equally passionate and distant, unable to blossom in an intolerant world, but especially in a fearful one.For the culmination of a long term love to be ""I swear,"" left me knowing that even when I can't get out of my own way, there is a fight to be had, against the intolerance, fear and torture of a world which masks it's truths with worse fears.",5,"Powerful, Moving, Beautiful...",1137283200,"01 15, 2006",2006,2494,"['superbly', 'haunting', 'film', 'one', 'so', 'affecting', 'woke', 'up', 'middle', 'night', 'thinking', 'Beautifully', 'acted', 'directed', 'scored', 'shot', 'located', 'heart-wrenching', 'Brokeback', 'Mountain', 'likely', 'Best', 'Picture', '2005', 'Heath', 'Ledger', 'Jake', 'Gyllenhaal', 'give', 'career', 'best', 'performances', 'creating', 'portraits', 'two', 'men', 'love', 'distinctly', 'different', 'capacity', 'understand', 'accept', 'what', 'happened', 'particularly', 'who', 'are.Ang', 'Lee', 'truly', 'one', 'cinema', 'best', 'directors', 'who', 'deft', 'handling', 'different', 'genres', 'American', 'comic', 'book', 'mythology', 'sublime', 'Chinese', 'martial', 'arts', 'ballet', '70', 'era', 'suburban', 'East', 'Coast', 'drama', '19th', 'century', 'pastoral', 'English', 'romance', 'etc', 'here', 'contrasts', 'stunning', 'wide', 'open', 'space', 'isolation', 'physical', 'internal', 'isolation', 'need', 'battle', 'elements', 'alone', 'versus', 'together', 'attempt', 'mask', 'repress', 'heart', 'tradition', 'denying', 'rebel', 'also', 'much', 'metaphor', 'express', 'opposing', 'natures', 'men', 'women', 'example', 'Jack', 'Gyllenhaal', 'evolving', 'submission', 'father-in-law', 'developed', 'few', 'scenes', 'ending', 'relieving', 'turkey', 'cutting', 'scene', 'maturity', 'acceptance', 'moving', 'images', 'Ennis', 'Ledger', 'alone', 'stoned', 'paralysis', 'are', 'what', 'film', 'disconnect', 'what', 'story', 'fear', 'uncontrollable', 'passion', 'wreak', 'havoc', 'others', 'too', 'mostly', 'Ennis', 'romantic', 'pragmatic', 'two', 'tortured', 'true', 'love', 'ca', ""n't"", 'accept', 'Jack', 'flamboyant', 'hopeful', 'one', 'who', 'sexuality', 'embrace.But', 'homosexuality', 'secondary', 'film', 'just', 'time', 'period', '1963', '20', 'years', 'important', 'time', 'when', 'cowboys', 'America', 'mythic', 'man', 'were', 'dying', 'out', 'residents', 'ghost', 'towns', 'made', 'young', 'guys', 'needing', 'be', 'fathers', 'etc', 'differences', 'Ennis', 'Jack', 'also', 'evolve', 'One', 'remaining', 'ranch', 'hand/herder', 'other', 'going', 'business', 'wealth.But', 'timelessness', 'primarily', 'relationship', 'equally', 'passionate', 'distant', 'unable', 'blossom', 'intolerant', 'world', 'especially', 'fearful', 'culmination', 'long', 'term', 'love', 'be', 'swear', 'left', 'knowing', 'even', 'when', 'ca', ""n't"", 'get', 'own', 'way', 'fight', 'be', 'had', 'intolerance', 'fear', 'torture', 'world', 'truths', 'worse', 'fears']",N/A

A 60s setting, some gorgeous scenery, a methodical, patient pace, yet half way through the movie, you realize that not only are you watching two guys kissing (when was the last time you saw that? Heck, have I ever seen that?), but that they are going to simulate sex (without the genitals) right there on the screen and you, if you are brave enough, are going to sit through it!(I asked my girlfriend to hold my hand. Girls: it takes a real man to see this movie. Let them take you to a horror movie - you get them back and take them to this.)Despite all of these political and sexual asides, this is an awesome movie. I recently saw ""Walk the Line"" again on cable (already!). While it is a wonderful portrayal of Johnny Cash, it is not an stirringly emotional movie like Brokeback Mountain. It is no surprise to me that ""Brokeback"" jokes are already in the vernacular of the day. This movie has a profound impact of our current culture.Heath Ledger and Jake ""G-something-unpronounceable"" do a wonderful job. Though they are on the screen through-out the entire movie, they carry the burden as lightly as a T-shirt. Ledger will never be thought lightweight again. There is more acting here than ""Capote.""

172347,A3GKU0NILLHDWQ,1417030321,A. Hickman,"[57, 65]","There is absolutely nothing left to say about this film that hasn't already been said.  Yet I feel compelled to add my five cents, if only because of the slight it received at the Academy Awards.  Simply put, this is the most important American film of the past twenty-five years.  It is provocative, it is breathtakingly beautiful, and it is flawlessly acted, but it is also a movie with a heart, and I defy anyone with the sensitivity of a snail not to be moved by Jack and Ennis' tragic love story.  The movie has received its share of criticism, but bear in mind that most of that has come from people who refuse to see the film.  I'm including Tony Curtis and Ernest Borgnine, among other Academy voters, who allowed their bigotry to stand in the way of their seeing the film.  They cast their votes in ignorance.  Go figure.  But none of that has stopped ""Brokeback"" from becoming possibly the most honored film in the history of cinema.  It has won fourteen Best Picture awards that I know of, beginning with the Vienna Film Festival Award and including the recent GLAAD Award for best picture.  It is a film that will continue to be viewed and studied, both for pleasure and for pure love of cinema for decades to come.  I place ""Brokeback"" in the same category as ""Romeo and Juliet"" or ""La Traviata""--one of the great love stories of all time.

Ironically, there should be no surprise whatever that male-dominated societal enclaves like the military, the clergy, and the State Department are rife with homosexuality, no matter how secretive or repressed.  But this is not even the point of Brokeback Mountain, which is not a ""gay cowboy movie"" any more than Jaws is a fishing movie.Brokeback Mountain is a love story, specifically a story of forbidden love, and the horrifying emotional toll such a situation takes.  As with Legends Of The Fall, the real hero is Wyoming, Ang Lee has given us a loving, idyllic vision of the American West that seems to glow with purity and splendor.  (Let's protect it!)  Texas does not get off quite so easily, few people know better than writer Larry McMurty how god-awful flat, dry, and just plain miserable it is.  As to Annie Proulx, (just can't bear to add that affected E. in front of her name), whose story provided the foundation for the film, what can one say except that - wherever you find humanity's saddest qualities, darkest despair, and most senselessly cruel and violent tendencies, there you will find Ms. Proulx!  That's the spirit, Annie!Ledger's performance is haunting; his hurt seems to rise off him like steam.  Gyllenhaal, a terrific actor with a name that's hard to spell, is also outstanding, although his western twang does seem suspect at times.  Great supporting work by the wives.  Michelle Williams, as Alma Del Mar, is every bit as injured and silent as her husband, trapped and very sympathetic.  Anne Hathaway, as the Texas heavy equipment Princess, is perfection; there is a toughness to her that's very believable.The hype surrounding Brokeback Mountain was unfortunate, but inevitable.  Viewers who are able to put their homophobia in park for a couple of hours will discover a masterfully crafted film about two individual human beings attempting to find love in a world exquisitely designed to deny them access to it.

172353,A3NQU1649SH0Q4,1417030321,"Allen Smalling ""Eclectic Reader,""","[24, 31]","BROKEBACK MOUNTAIN is one of the outstanding films of 2005, a year full of outstanding films.  Based on a 1997 short story by Annie Proulx, the film follows twenty years in the lives of two impecunious Wyoming ranch hands, Ennis del Mar (Heath Ledger) and Jack Twist (Jake Gyllenhall) as they meet pasturing sheep in the uplands, fall in love, become intimate sexually, and then try to face a world back down on the flatlands that does not tolerate ""queer"" nor recognize ""gay.""**SPOILERS** Their attempts to have a socially acceptable adult life--in essence a double life--yet stay true to themselves is doomed, and the film shows us how the relationship breaks down slowly over the years between 1963, when the two men meet, and the early eighties, when, already estranged, Ennis learns that his lover was killed on a desolate Texas highway.  The early scenes between the two men are idyllic and gracious, lovely and passionate, and I doubt Wyoming from its mountains to its ""Big Sky"" country has ever been better photographed for a film.But Ennis is already engaged to be married, and after a couple of years is saddled with a wife, two children and a drudge job that leaves him very little time to spend with Jack.  Jack himself, while riding the rodeo circuit, meets a beautiful and charming young woman whose father happens to be rich; the two marry and Jack moves to Texas.  This is not a ""same time next year"" kind of movie but one that shows a deteriorating relationship in which the participants blame themselves for its undoing, not their restrictive and at times brutal society, which at one point literally ropes up ""gay"" by the genitals and drags it to death.**For all its heartbreak, BROKEBACK MOUNTAIN is a lean movie whose stunning vistas are matched only by flawless performances, including not only Ledger and Gyllenhall but Randy Quaid as the men's intolerant boss and Ann Hathaway (she of ELLA ENCHANTED!) as Jack's increasingly cynical wife.I must admit I'm confused by the reviewers who found no legitimate love relationship in this film between Ennis and Jack.  IMHO I found the sexual tension between the two men quite believable, just as believable as the one true sex scene portrayed in the film, a hurried fumble in the close confines of a pup tent on a stormy high-prairie night.  (I am reminded of sex researcher C.A. Tripp, who commented on the ""explosive"" nature of men-on-men sex in THE HOMOSEXUAL MATRIX and other works.)  But to say there is no love?  The two men roughhouse and nuzzle, skinny-dip and cuddle, and generally show their affection in both tough and tender ways.  In other words, they acted like men.  The scene where Ennis and Jack first part company shows Ennis literally collapsing in rage and pain, beating his fists raw against a wooden barn door, as though his innards had been ripped out.  Ladies and gents, this is not the action of a peeved youth upset because he needs a new source of nookie; this is love!  To me the movie owes its restrictive censorship rating more to the language than anything else, as the two men in true cowboy fashion pepper their language with the f-word and the s-word in their many varieties.This is a movie to recommend not just to people who like good movies but to the occasional soul who asks me or my friends, ""Why make such a big deal about being gay?  Why not just live your life and get on with it?""  BROKEBACK MOUNTAIN shows the impossiblity of living in the closet with dignity, and the brutal consequences of trying to live so in 1963--the devastation not only reaches homosexuals but those who love them such as divorced spouses and confused children.

172354,ATDE9JYCPI0L1,1417030321,Alyssa A. Lappen,"[12, 16]","Like other reviewers, I found the characters in this film invading my life. The night I saw the film, I did not sleep well; my dreams were haunted by the losses experienced by Ennis DelMar (Heath Ledger) and Jack Twist (Jake Gyllenhaal). The following day, they stayed with me.The film, based on the 1997 New Yorker story of Annie Proulx, throws Ennis and Jack together on Wyoming's fictional Brokeback Mountain where they guard sheep for the summer of 1963. The rancher who hires them, a distant relative of Jack, discovers their liaison, terminates their work earlier in the season than planned, and refuses to hire Jack again the next year.But that doesn't end the relationship. Desperate, Jack four years later sends Ennis a postcard and the lovers soon begin meeting for ""fishing"" weekends and week-long vacations at Brokeback.In 1963, of course, life was far more complicated for gay men than today. Even in the big cities, there was no gay rights movement. But in the countryside and west, things were far more tenuous indeed. Lest this point is unclear, viewers witness Ennis' flashback as he recounts the time his father dragged him by the hand to view the dead body of a gay rancher, murdered and mutilated for his sins.Jack and Ennis are enough in love to periodically cast aside their heterosexual pretenses and families and to reunite in the wilderness setting closest, along with one another, to their hearts. But they are not enough in love to permanently eschew traditional lives and set out in life together, whatever the cost.Like other reviewers, I too have heard women complain about the infidelity of Jack and Ennis to their respective wives, and their consequent ""immorality."" What disturbed me much more was their refusal to openly admit their love and act upon it in a meaningful way.Heath Ledger needs no more recognition for his startling portrayal of the conflicted Ennis. For me, he reembodied a Texan friend who died of AIDS many years ago. His refusal to accept his feelings also revived my memories of and sadness for heterosexual men who were equally unable to commit themselves --- which in a few cases I believe caused ill health, and even early death.But Jake Gyllenhaal also did a superb job portraying his personal difficulty and ambivalence.--Alyssa A.

There,he meets Jack Twist (Jake Gyllenhaal),and there's a spark between them. For a time,they enjoy a pastoral and amorous idyll. Soon,their paradise is lost. Both Ennis and Jack marry. They have children. They reunite every summer, their time together bittersweet. Apart from each other, Ennis and Jack break down. Ennis' marriage ends in divorce. Jack carries on an affair with another cowboy,and also has a one night stand with a Mexican prostitute. Jack has hopes for a life with Ennis-but Ennis is afraid. In the end, Jack is murdered in a gay-bashing,and Ennis lives a life mourning ""the road not taken."" Ledger is excellent as the emotionally uptight Ennis,while Gyllenhaal is heartbreaking as the hopeful Jack.""Brokeback Mountain"" is hardly ""homosexual propaganda"" (as LifeSite has called it),or an ""attack on masculinity"" (according to DecentFilms) Jack&Ennis;' mutual adultery does devastate their families. It's not the ""adultery without consequences"" that's so often glamorized. The consummation between Jack&Ennis; is disturbing because it looks like a rape--not because it's between two men. The morning after is hardly domestic bliss-Ennis finds a lamb killed by a wolf during the night. Anne Hathaway is amazingly sympathetic as Jack's heartbroken wife.The positive aspects of the movie are the performances of the leads,the powerful soundtrack (Gustavo Santoalalla is great),its beautiful scenery.One can disagree with the movie's message that it's an argument for gay marriage,or that homosexual and heterosexual love are the same,but it stands as a work of an art. As a work of art,it's open to interpretation;it's hardly ""a homosexual propaganda film."" Does it say gay is OK? It depends on the viewer.The ending of ""Brokeback Mountain"" is a tearjerker. When Ennis cradles Jack's bloodied shirt in his arms,how can one be unmoved? ""Brokeback Mountain"" takes on new,poignant resonance in light of Heath Ledger's tragic,untimely death. Ennis was his breakthrough role,showing his promise as a subtle,powerful actor. He conveyed the depth of Ennis' emotional repression&suffering.; Heath Ledger will rightly be remembered for ""Brokeback"".RIP Heath Ledger (1979-2008)",3,"""When a man loves a man""",1199404800,"01 4, 2008",2008,2659,"['Brokeback', 'Mountain', 'was', 'breakthrough', 'mainstream', 'American', 'cinema', 'first', 'relatively', 'mainstream', 'movie', 'address', 'gay', 'issues', 'treat', 'gay', 'romance', 'same', 'way', 'straight', 'one', 'fact', 'poster/CD', 'cover', 'leads', 'was', 'purposefully', 'modeled', 'one', 'Titanic', 'Titanic', 'however', 'Brokeback', 'up', 'important', 'issues', 'great', 'depth', 'emotionally', 'moving.Ennis', 'Del', 'Mar', 'Heath', 'Ledger', 'mountains', 'Wyoming', 'sheep', 'herding', 'Jack', 'Twist', 'Jake', 'Gyllenhaal', 'spark', 'time', 'enjoy', 'pastoral', 'amorous', 'idyll', 'Soon', 'paradise', 'lost', 'Ennis', 'Jack', 'marry', 'have', 'children', 'reunite', 'summer', 'time', 'together', 'bittersweet', 'Apart', 'other', 'Ennis', 'Jack', 'break', 'down', 'Ennis', 'marriage', 'divorce', 'Jack', 'affair', 'cowboy', 'also', 'one', 'night', 'stand', 'Mexican', 'prostitute', 'Jack', 'hopes', 'life', 'Ennis-but', 'Ennis', 'afraid', 'end', 'Jack', 'murdered', 'gay-bashing', 'Ennis', 'life', 'mourning', 'road', 'not', 'taken', 'Ledger', 'excellent', 'emotionally', 'uptight', 'Ennis', 'Gyllenhaal', 'heartbreaking', 'hopeful', 'Jack', 'Brokeback', 'Mountain', 'hardly', 'homosexual', 'propaganda', 'LifeSite', 'called', 'attack', 'masculinity', 'according', 'DecentFilms', 'Jack', 'Ennis', 'mutual', 'adultery', 'devastate', 'families', 'not', 'adultery', 'consequences', 'so', 'often', 'glamorized', 'consummation', 'Jack', 'Ennis', 'disturbing', 'rape', 'not', 'two', 'men', 'morning', 'hardly', 'domestic', 'bliss-Ennis', 'lamb', 'killed', 'wolf', 'night', 'Anne', 'Hathaway', 'amazingly', 'sympathetic', 'Jack', 'heartbroken', 'wife.The', 'positive', 'aspects', 'movie', 'are', 'performances', 'leads', 'powerful', 'soundtrack', 'Gustavo', 'Santoalalla', 'great', 'beautiful', 'scenery.One', 'can', 'disagree', 'movie', 'message', 'argument', 'gay', 'marriage', 'homosexual', 'heterosexual', 'love', 'are', 'same', 'work', 'art', 'work', 'art', 'open', 'interpretation', 'hardly', 'homosexual', 'propaganda', 'film', 'say', 'gay', 'OK', 'viewer.The', 'ending', 'Brokeback', 'Mountain', 'tearjerker', 'When', 'Ennis', 'Jack', 'bloodied', 'shirt', 'arms', 'how', 'can', 'one', 'be', 'unmoved', 'Brokeback', 'Mountain', 'new', 'poignant', 'resonance', 'light', 'Heath', 'Ledger', 'tragic', 'untimely', 'death', 'Ennis', 'was', 'breakthrough', 'role', 'showing', 'promise', 'subtle', 'powerful', 'actor', 'conveyed', 'depth', 'Ennis', 'emotional', 'repression', 'suffering', 'Heath', 'Ledger', 'will', 'rightly', 'be', 'remembered', 'Brokeback', 'Heath', 'Ledger', '1979-2008']",N/A
172357,AK0CENM3LUM28,1417030321,Amazon Customer,"[10, 12]","Brokeback Mountain / B00005JOFQ*Spoilers*Somehow I missed watching Brokeback Mountain when it was first released and it's been on my ""Things to Watch"" list forever, and now I'm probably the last person on earth to watch it. Just about anything I can say about this wonderful movie seems woefully superfluous at this point, and yet it seems fair to point out that I'm yet another person taken in by this tragic and touching movie.I'm not usually a big fan of romances and tear-jerkers, largely because my tears are so easily jerked that I'm one of those people who cry during previews (especially theWall-Epreview, *sniffle*), and I can't say that I'm ever likely to return to Brokeback Mountain a second time, but that's not because I didn't enjoy the movie (far from it) but rather because this movie is memorable at a level comparable to searing itself onto one's brain matter. The writing is simply superb, the acting is quite possibly the best I've ever seen, and the plot is both simple and straightforward (forbidden love) while still being incredibly complicated and thought-provoking.It's hard to say what I liked most about this movie. I appreciated that Ledger's character wasn't given an 'easy out' in terms of his almost emotionally abusive behavior towards Gyllenhaal's character. Yes, the movie acknowledges powerfully that Ennis' behavior is driven by a guilt and fear that was instilled in him powerfully at a young age, but though Ennis is a victim, the movie does not insist that we hand him complete forgiveness for his treatment of Jack. Ennis is holding on to Jack because he loves him, and we pity him for being unable to embrace him fully, yet he seems blissfully, willfully blind to Jack's own pain at their near-constant separation, and Ennis is at fault for not making more time for his lover, or at least make his feelings plain and clear enough to ease some of Jack's pain and doubt.I also greatly appreciated the tenderness with which the movie approaches Ennis' wife and her feelings towards her husband's affair. It would have been tempting to cast her as all saint (understanding her husband's needs and accepting it without any feeling on her part) or as a convenient villain (thus making it morally 'acceptable' for Ennis to behave as he does), yet she is neither and the movie is better for it. As a human being, she struggles with her hurt over Ennis' adultery balanced against his steadfastness as a provider and father, if not as a loving husband. Even when her anger boils over, she never loses sight of the fact that she loves Ennis (as the father of her children, if nothing else), and she does not spread the rumors that he fears might literally end his life.I felt that the ambiguity over Jack's death was a careful touch. We are unsure whether the story of Jack's death was merely a cover for the murder Ennis imagines, and whether or not it is a figment of his imagination colors his acceptance of the matter. Was Jack's death a tragic event that he could have prevented by running off with him? Or would running off with him merely have put them both in further danger? It's impossible to say, and it's easy to imagine Ennis tormenting himself with this question for the rest of his life.Like pretty much everyone else on earth, it seems, I deeply recommend Brokeback Mountain for a tragic and touching tale of love and loss.~ Ana Mardoll",5,Touching and Beautiful,1246320000,"06 30, 2009",2009,3384,"['Brokeback', 'Mountain', '/', 'B00005JOFQ*Spoilers*Somehow', 'missed', 'watching', 'Brokeback', 'Mountain', 'when', 'was', 'first', 'released', 'been', 'Things', 'Watch', 'list', 'forever', 'now', ""'m"", 'probably', 'last', 'person', 'earth', 'watch', 'Just', 'anything', 'can', 'say', 'wonderful', 'movie', 'woefully', 'superfluous', 'point', 'yet', 'fair', 'point', 'out', ""'m"", 'yet', 'person', 'taken', 'tragic', 'touching', 'movie.I', ""'m"", 'not', 'usually', 'big', 'fan', 'romances', 'tear-jerkers', 'largely', 'tears', 'are', 'so', 'easily', 'jerked', ""'m"", 'one', 'people', 'who', 'cry', 'previews', 'especially', 'theWall-Epreview', '*sniffle*', 'ca', ""n't"", 'say', ""'m"", 'ever', 'likely', 'return', 'Brokeback', 'Mountain', 'second', 'time', 'not', 'did', ""n't"", 'enjoy', 'movie', 'far', 'rather', 'movie', 'memorable', 'level', 'comparable', 'searing', 'one', 'brain', 'matter', 'writing', 'simply', 'superb', 'acting', 'quite', 'possibly', 'best', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'seen', 'plot', 'simple', 'straightforward', 'forbidden', 'love', 'still', 'being', 'incredibly', 'complicated', 'thought-provoking.It', 'hard', 'say', 'what', 'liked', 'most', 'movie', 'appreciated', 'Ledger', 'character', 'was', ""n't"", 'given', ""'easy"", 'out', 'terms', 'almost', 'emotionally', 'abusive', 'behavior', 'towards', 'Gyllenhaal', 'character', 'Yes', 'movie', 'powerfully', 'Ennis', 'behavior', 'driven', 'guilt', 'fear', 'was', 'instilled', 'powerfully', 'young', 'age', 'Ennis', 'victim', 'movie', 'not', 'insist', 'hand', 'complete', 'forgiveness', 'treatment', 'Jack', 'Ennis', 'holding', 'Jack', 'pity', 'being', 'unable', 'embrace', 'fully', 'yet', 'blissfully', 'willfully', 'blind', 'Jack', 'own', 'pain', 'near-constant', 'separation', 'Ennis', 'fault', 'not', 'making', 'more', 'time', 'lover', 'least', 'make', 'feelings', 'plain', 'clear', 'enough', 'ease', 'Jack', 'pain', 'doubt.I', 'also', 'greatly', 'appreciated', 'tenderness', 'movie', 'Ennis', 'wife', 'feelings', 'husband', 'affair', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'tempting', 'cast', 'saint', 'understanding', 'husband', 'needs', 'accepting', 'feeling', 'part', 'convenient', 'villain', 'thus', 'making', 'morally', ""'acceptable"", 'Ennis', 'behave', 'yet', 'movie', 'better', 'human', 'being', 'hurt', 'Ennis', 'adultery', 'balanced', 'steadfastness', 'provider', 'father', 'not', 'loving', 'husband', 'Even', 'when', 'anger', 'over', 'never', 'sight', 'fact', 'Ennis', 'father', 'children', 'nothing', 'else', 'not', 'spread', 'rumors', 'might', 'literally', 'end', 'life.I', 'felt', 'ambiguity', 'Jack', 'death', 'was', 'careful', 'touch', 'are', 'unsure', 'story', 'Jack', 'death', 'was', 'merely', 'cover', 'murder', 'Ennis', 'imagines', 'not', 'figment', 'imagination', 'colors', 'acceptance', 'matter', 'Was', 'Jack', 'death', 'tragic', 'event', 'could', 'have', 'prevented', 'running', 'off', 'would', 'running', 'off', 'merely', 'have', 'put', 'further', 'danger', 'impossible', 'say', 'easy', 'imagine', 'Ennis', 'tormenting', 'question', 'rest', 'life.Like', 'pretty', 'much', 'everyone', 'else', 'earth', 'deeply', 'recommend', 'Brokeback', 'Mountain', 'tragic', 'touching', 'tale', 'love', 'loss.~', 'Ana', 'Mardoll']",N/A

172360,ANCOMAI0I7LVG,1417030321,Andrew Ellington,"[29, 31]","`Brokeback Mountain' will stand the tests of time, for that I'm certain.  Many would argue that it's only because of it's taboo subject matter or controversy but in the end, after the dust has settled and the smoke has cleared `Brokeback Mountain' is more than just a superlative talking point, it's a monumental powerhouse of a motion picture, from it's brilliant script to it's earth shattering acting to it's award winning directing.  At it's very core `Brokeback Mountain' is a story about life as we see it, live it and need it and it reaches to the heartstrings of much more than would be expected.  This is far deeper than `gay cinema' as some have labeled it but is modern cinema at its finest and teaches valid and life changing points that everyone can learn from despite their orientation and or morality.The film, based of Annie Proulx's short story, centers around the lives of two sheepherders Ennis Del Mar and Jack Twist.  The two meet when they are but eighteen, Ennis engaged to his sweetheart Alma and Jack just trying to find himself.  They spend the summer together on Brokeback Mountain, herding sheep and albeit unintentionally falling in love.  The film setting begins in the early sixties and advancing twenty-some-odd-years before its conclusion and throughout the notion of repressed sexual feelings it made apparent. It's not culturally acceptable for these two men to even entertain the idea of loving and or being together, and so after their summer-long affair they go their separate ways, Ennis to marry Alma and Jack to eventually find and fall for Lureen.  Years later, after the births of their children, the memory of their affair still plagues them, not in regret of action but in regret of leaving it alone for so long and so they start up again, rekindling a flame that could only end in tragedy.The film is less a `gay love story' and more a universal cry for love in the most complex of terms.  This film proves that you can't pick the one you love but that the thoughts and feelings of those around us, whether it be close family, friends or the idea of a culture in whole can and will affect our decisions to whom and how to love.  While I feel that Jack Twist's character is and was a homosexual man I feel that Ennis was more or less a man you found love in a place he least expected it.  He never sought after the attention of other men as Jack did.  In fact even after Alma leaves him he still seeks the affection of a woman, but Jack and Jack alone had stolen his heart.  That's what's so moving and inspiring about this film is that it parades the truth that love is love and one must embrace that love of lose all happiness they could ever know.What helps elevate this film so far above the competition is the brilliant acting on the entire cast, a cast of young talented stars who blew up in such a big way by taking on such a mature film.  Looking at the roster one may not believe they could handle the material but everyone involved is stellar.  Ledger plays Ennis with such restraint and precise confusion that one is brought to tears almost as much for Ledgers star turn as he is for the tragedy wrapped within his character.  Ledger creates a performance that stays with you.  Gyllenhaal also manages to brilliantly create a character we can relate to.  Jack Twist is someone we know and maybe even a little bit of each of us, a man who just wants to live his life and doesn't care what the consequences.  Death to him is a fair enough price to pay for freedom.  Michelle Williams is a revelation as Alma, her pain, her subtle emotion, her breakdown and her silently unraveling sanity is as moving as it is astonishing to watch.  Anne Hathaway, while not receiving the critical attention of her co-stars delivers a brilliant performance and deserves to be recognized.  Her performance as Lureen may not have been as baity as the character given to Williams, but she maneuvers her character through her scenes with a maturity that she is recently blossoming into.Visually stunning and emotionally captivating `Brokeback Mountain' is a movie that demands to be seen and taken seriously and is one that will stay with the viewer for years even decades to come.  We feel the pain in Ennis' gut as he falls to his knees in despair over leaving Jack.  We feel the torment in Alma's eyes as she watches the man she loves embrace another man.  We feel the frustration in Jack's demeanor as he pleads for Ennis to stay with him, give him anything more than an annual escapade.  But most of all we feel our own heart breaking and setting as we realize how this film and it's very essence effect us in ways we'd never imagine.  Gay, straight, male or female we have all met our Ennis or Jack and maybe even let him or her go because of outside influence or confusion of heart.  May this tragic tale of love denied and love lost move us to never let that happen to us again.",5,Deeply moving if not unsettling masterpiece of modern cinema...,1182729600,"06 25, 2007",2007,4919,"['Brokeback', 'Mountain', 'will', 'stand', 'tests', 'time', ""'m"", 'certain', 'Many', 'would', 'argue', 'only', 'taboo', 'subject', 'matter', 'controversy', 'end', 'dust', 'settled', 'smoke', 'cleared', 'Brokeback', 'Mountain', 'more', 'just', 'superlative', 'talking', 'point', 'monumental', 'powerhouse', 'motion', 'picture', 'brilliant', 'script', 'earth', 'shattering', 'acting', 'award', 'winning', 'directing', 'very', 'core', 'Brokeback', 'Mountain', 'story', 'about', 'life', 'see', 'live', 'need', 'heartstrings', 'much', 'more', 'would', 'be', 'expected', 'far', 'deeper', 'gay', 'cinema', 'have', 'labeled', 'modern', 'cinema', 'finest', 'teaches', 'valid', 'life', 'changing', 'points', 'everyone', 'can', 'learn', 'orientation', 'morality.The', 'film', 'based', 'Annie', 'Proulx', 'short', 'story', 'centers', 'lives', 'two', 'sheepherders', 'Ennis', 'Del', 'Mar', 'Jack', 'Twist', 'two', 'meet', 'when', 'are', 'eighteen', 'Ennis', 'engaged', 'sweetheart', 'Alma', 'Jack', 'just', 'trying', 'find', 'spend', 'summer', 'together', 'Brokeback', 'Mountain', 'herding', 'sheep', 'albeit', 'unintentionally', 'falling', 'love', 'film', 'setting', 'begins', 'early', 'sixties', 'advancing', 'twenty-some-odd-years', 'conclusion', 'notion', 'repressed', 'sexual', 'feelings', 'made', 'apparent', 'not', 'culturally', 'acceptable', 'two', 'men', 'even', 'entertain', 'idea', 'loving', 'being', 'together', 'so', 'summer-long', 'affair', 'go', 'separate', 'ways', 'Ennis', 'marry', 'Alma', 'Jack', 'eventually', 'find', 'fall', 'Lureen', 'Years', 'later', 'births', 'children', 'memory', 'affair', 'still', 'not', 'regret', 'action', 'regret', 'leaving', 'alone', 'so', 'long', 'so', 'start', 'up', 'again', 'rekindling', 'flame', 'could', 'only', 'end', 'tragedy.The', 'film', 'less', 'gay', 'love', 'story', 'more', 'universal', 'cry', 'love', 'most', 'complex', 'terms', 'film', 'ca', ""n't"", 'pick', 'one', 'love', 'thoughts', 'feelings', 'be', 'close', 'family', 'idea', 'culture', 'whole', 'can', 'will', 'affect', 'decisions', 'whom', 'how', 'love', 'feel', 'Jack', 'Twist', 'character', 'was', 'homosexual', 'man', 'feel', 'Ennis', 'was', 'more', 'less', 'man', 'found', 'love', 'place', 'least', 'expected', 'never', 'sought', 'attention', 'other', 'men', 'Jack', 'did', 'fact', 'even', 'Alma', 'still', 'affection', 'woman', 'Jack', 'Jack', 'alone', 'had', 'stolen', 'heart', 'what', 'so', 'moving', 'inspiring', 'film', 'truth', 'love', 'love', 'one', 'must', 'embrace', 'love', 'lose', 'happiness', 'could', 'ever', 'know.What', 'elevate', 'film', 'so', 'far', 'competition', 'brilliant', 'acting', 'entire', 'cast', 'cast', 'young', 'talented', 'stars', 'who', 'blew', 'up', 'big', 'way', 'taking', 'mature', 'film', 'Looking', 'roster', 'one', 'may', 'not', 'believe', 'could', 'handle', 'material', 'everyone', 'involved', 'stellar', 'Ledger', 'Ennis', 'such', 'restraint', 'precise', 'confusion', 'one', 'brought', 'tears', 'almost', 'much', 'Ledgers', 'star', 'turn', 'tragedy', 'wrapped', 'character', 'Ledger', 'performance', 'Gyllenhaal', 'also', 'brilliantly', 'create', 'character', 'can', 'relate', 'Jack', 'Twist', 'someone', 'know', 'maybe', 'even', 'little', 'bit', 'man', 'who', 'just', 'live', 'life', ""n't"", 'care', 'what', 'consequences', 'Death', 'fair', 'enough', 'price', 'pay', 'freedom', 'Michelle', 'Williams', 'revelation', 'Alma', 'pain', 'subtle', 'emotion', 'breakdown', 'silently', 'unraveling', 'sanity', 'as', 'moving', 'astonishing', 'watch', 'Anne', 'Hathaway', 'not', 'receiving', 'critical', 'attention', 'co-stars', 'delivers', 'brilliant', 'performance', 'be', 'recognized', 'performance', 'Lureen', 'may', 'not', 'have', 'been', 'as', 'baity', 'character', 'given', 'Williams', 'character', 'scenes', 'maturity', 'recently', 'blossoming', 'into.Visually', 'stunning', 'emotionally', 'captivating', 'Brokeback', 'Mountain', 'movie', 'be', 'seen', 'taken', 'seriously', 'one', 'will', 'stay', 'viewer', 'years', 'even', 'decades', 'come', 'feel', 'pain', 'Ennis', 'gut', 'knees', 'despair', 'leaving', 'Jack', 'feel', 'torment', 'Alma', 'eyes', 'man', 'embrace', 'man', 'feel', 'frustration', 'Jack', 'demeanor', 'Ennis', 'stay', 'give', 'anything', 'more', 'annual', 'escapade', 'most', 'feel', 'own', 'heart', 'breaking', 'setting', 'realize', 'how', 'film', 'very', 'essence', 'effect', 'ways', ""'d"", 'never', 'imagine', 'Gay', 'straight', 'male', 'female', 'have', 'met', 'Ennis', 'Jack', 'maybe', 'even', 'let', 'go', 'outside', 'influence', 'confusion', 'heart', 'May', 'tragic', 'tale', 'love', 'denied', 'love', 'lost', 'move', 'never', 'let', 'happen', 'again']",N/A
172361,A29X0YEL6O4KZI,1417030321,"Andrew J. Dobrow ""Career Writer""","[31, 46]","Ennis Del Mar (Heath Ledger) is a drifter, Jack Twist (Jake Gyllenhaal) is looking for work. The opening sequence of the film signifies a beginning of these mens fate. Ennis and Jack are both at a trailer office of a herder, looking for work for a few months, just enough money to get by, but what unfolds from this fateful meeting is a relationship that effects these two men's lives until the day they die.When it comes down to it, Brokeback Mountain is a love story, yet what sets is apart from any other romance is the fact that these two cowboys happen to both be men. While on a job watching a sheep herd, Ennis and Jack become more then just coworkers. On their first encounter, the sexual experience seems completely lustful and animalistic. There are no words, just pure unadulterated lust. By the second encounter with these two men, you can see a change. These men are no longer just trying to get through the boredom of a lonely night, these men are in love. The contact is more emotional and sensual. Under normal circumstances, contact such as this between two men would make me queasy. But the way that director Ang Lee goes about it, leads to not nausea, but a genuine care for the characters. While watching, you don't look at these two men as homosexuals. You look at them as two men in love. Just two souls on the same line of fate that matched each other perfect. The end of the movie comes in a rush and moves along to quickly to hold any real emotion, which is my only qualm with the film as a whole.Heath Ledger as Ennis is amazingly well-cast. He is living the character rather then playing the character. His emotions are genuine and his gestures are natural. Jake Gyllenhaal also does a decent job of holding up his role as Jack Twist, but there are moments during his performance where it seems that he has not matured enough as an actor to hold such a role.His character seems annoyingly static, while it should be dynamic. Anne Hathaway as Laureen Newsome, Jack's wife, is ravishing as usual. Her beauty is persevered even as the years pass in the story and the times change.The script adaptation of the novel is transcribed very well from the pages to the big screen. Director Ang Lee does a consistently good job through out the film. The element that captures the touches of Ang Lee are the little things. Such as Ennis' daughter becoming a lot like her father, described as ""not saying much but getting her point across"". Ang Lee also does a stellar job of showing both mens point of views throughout the movie.So when all has been said and done, this was not a story about a homosexual relationship, but a tale of true love. Two souls bound for each other that seems not as much taboo as it does unfair. These men are stuck in their love, and are stuck in their on lives. But it just goes to show, love never dies.

Also about the whole Gay part I just have to say that I really have NO particular feelings on the subject. Which means that I don't think being Gay is wrong, bad or even unnature, nor do I think that Gay people shouldn't belong together. But when I say I have no particular feelings I meant not one way or the other, the other in this case I meant I don't feel Jack and Ennis' romance, there is no sweet twinking love feeling for me. This is also a large part of the reason why I found it boring at first.But half way through I felt something, and it wasn't the Gay part but the honest feeling of loneliness. The misunderstanding recieved by people- the worst kind of loneliness, and also the feeling of wanting some thing so bad but cannot have it. This is portrayed very well and very deeply that it carves into your flesh and bone. It is very honest, and I think this movie is something everyone, whether you are straight or gay, can relate to.Also I disagree with some people saying that it portrayed gay people badly- that they only decieve. I didn't feel that at all, both men are, in a way, faithful to their wives and tried their best to be a good husband and father. But because of this unthinkable thing (during that time) that they want, they suffer for it, and torned between the voices in their hearts and the societal ""morals"".Also I like to say kudos to both actors, they truly shone out the characters, especially kudos to Heath Ledger, I think he will do great things in the future.I need to watch the DVD with subtitles before deciding whether to change my grading to five stars, hope it comes out soon!!!",4,"very honest story, true to the end",1139011200,"02 4, 2006",2006,1814,"['have', 'admit', 'first', 'half', 'movie', 'did', ""n't"", 'capture', 'thought', 'dragged', 'little', 'bit', 'too', 'long', 'mumbling', 'texas', 'accent', 'made', 'hard', 'understand', 'what', 'are', 'saying', 'Also', 'whole', 'Gay', 'part', 'just', 'have', 'say', 'really', 'have', 'NO', 'particular', 'feelings', 'subject', 'Which', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'being', 'Gay', 'wrong', 'bad', 'even', 'unnature', 'do', 'think', 'Gay', 'people', 'should', ""n't"", 'belong', 'together', 'when', 'say', 'have', 'particular', 'feelings', 'meant', 'not', 'one', 'way', 'other', 'other', 'case', 'meant', 'do', ""n't"", 'feel', 'Jack', 'Ennis', 'romance', 'sweet', 'twinking', 'love', 'feeling', 'also', 'large', 'part', 'reason', 'why', 'found', 'boring', 'first.But', 'way', 'felt', 'something', 'was', ""n't"", 'Gay', 'part', 'honest', 'feeling', 'loneliness', 'misunderstanding', 'recieved', 'people-', 'worst', 'kind', 'loneliness', 'also', 'feeling', 'wanting', 'thing', 'so', 'bad', 'can', 'not', 'have', 'portrayed', 'very', 'well', 'very', 'deeply', 'flesh', 'bone', 'very', 'honest', 'think', 'movie', 'something', 'everyone', 'are', 'straight', 'gay', 'can', 'relate', 'to.Also', 'disagree', 'people', 'saying', 'portrayed', 'gay', 'people', 'badly-', 'only', 'decieve', 'did', ""n't"", 'feel', 'men', 'are', 'way', 'faithful', 'wives', 'tried', 'best', 'be', 'good', 'husband', 'father', 'unthinkable', 'thing', 'time', 'want', 'suffer', 'torned', 'voices', 'hearts', 'societal', 'morals', '.Also', 'say', 'kudos', 'actors', 'truly', 'characters', 'especially', 'kudos', 'Heath', 'Ledger', 'think', 'will', 'do', 'great', 'things', 'future.I', 'need', 'watch', 'DVD', 'subtitles', 'deciding', 'change', 'grading', 'five', 'stars', 'hope', 'out', 'soon']",N/A
172366,A2UKC6QFG9L5GV,1417030321,Anton Ilinski,"[17, 30]","""Brokeback Mountain"" reminded me of Clint Eastwood's ""The Bridges of Madison County"" by its mood and pacing. It's one of those love stories that really touch your heart. ""Brokeback Mountain"" is not a simple story, it's about two persons' relationship and this relationship is complex like life itself. Jack and Ennis love each other although none of them are gay as they put it. But Ennis has a wife and two daughters, Jack also has a wife and kid. Besides where they both come from the bonds between two men that are too tight are not appreciated. There's more - they both work as cowboys, usually very manly occupation. But they attracted to each other and they can't do anything about it.This film is about happiness, about how difficult is sometimes to reach it yet it seems to be very close. It's difficult and easy at the same time, you just need to desire it very much. Therefore it's about decisions we make - sometimes wrong, sometimes right, but in the end no one can tell wrong from right. Jack and Ennis could be happy but the price could be the unhappiness of two broken families. Apart from being afraid of publicity they decided not to be happy themselves but also not to ruin the lives of their wives and children. So ""Brokeback Mountain"" is about moral obligations too.Maybe in other circumstances, in another time Jack and Ennis could live happily somewhere. But the story is set exactly where and when it's set so they had no choice.I guess Brokeback Mountain itself symbolizes every person's dream. It's the place people crave, where they are totally happy. Jack and Ennis were happy there sleeping on the ground, eating beans every day and being cut from the rest of the world. It was their personal paradise. I think if they could they'd live on the mountain, but they couldn't (the reasons don't matter), they've chosen to be happy for a couple of times a year, driving away from everyone else, having just each other, in the place they felt alive. It doesn't matter where they went - even some tatty motel would be their Brokeback Mountain from then on.I think everyone has his own Brokeback Mountain, his paradise, a place where you can be yourself. And it's not always a ""place"" literally. Some people finally get there and some not. Jack and Ennis couldn't.""Brokeback Mountain"" is a beautiful and sad story definately made by a sensitive person. And I'd say it's made for the sensitive. Ang Lee deserved his Oscar for sure.

It is not surprising, it's rather logical and natural, that the original short story was written by a woman, Annie Proulx. Her female viewpoint on the world shows very clearly in both main male characters. Therefore, while the plot line may be implausible and far-fetched for a lot of viewers personally, the film is made with excellent craft and deeply human overtones, which make it more believable and psychologically real. Ang Lee's directing of big emotions (Sense and Sensibility; Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon) and his work with actors is just peerless (Heath Ledger's performance is nothing short of amazing).

A very simple film about two very specific characters in a very specific time and place has been exaggerated into all sorts of politicized nonsense for and against.  So many agendas, so little time.I found this a beautifully written, acted, directed and photographed film filled with subtlety and understanding.  A compassionate study of an illicit love in a time and place of great repression, the movie walked a knife-edge and would have been even greater fodder for the late-night comedians had it not been in the hands of superb film-makers. Their skill has allowed a general audience to appreciate a film containing, for many, uncomfortable subject matter.I applaud the great courage of the two young leads who have been justly praised for their performances.  It looks good now, but it had a tremendous possibility for not only failure but also humiliation, and I recognize their risk-taking.But there was the writing of McMurtry and Osana, and the direction of Ang Lee and they made it work. And the specificity of the time and place is everything.This is a story of these two men, and the ruin they bring to themselves and others trying to live their lives as a lie, which was about their only option there and then.  I don't believe these guys lives bear any relation to the lives of gays in the great urban settings of New York, San Francisco, Los Angeles etc.  Jack might have fit in there, Ennis...never.I enjoyed the film as a specific story, like any other story.  The great craft involved allowed me to accept these characters and to eventually care about them, but I found no need to extrapolate beyond that to any great generalities.

It is about a love that is altogether sweet, complicated, delicate, haunting, unfulfilled, frustrating and devastating. The moral of the story... if you are unable to be true to yourself and be with the one you truly love and desire, you may well end up destroying not only your own life but the lives of others around you... love is that strange and selfish.Highly recommended, however, having an open mind is a must.

I won't go into a plot synopsis since that has been covered so many times on this site. I would like discuss the performances. Everyone involved in the film is excellent, in fact, flawless. I think Jake Gyllenhaal has been unjustly overlooked with all the praise over Heath Ledger's performance. Jake's performance is as good as Heath's--just in a understated sort of way. Also Ann Hathaway has an astonishing scene at the end on the phone with Heath's Ennis. My only complaint is that the film is a little slow, but this is a very tiny quibble. The screenplay is amazing and will definetly win the Oscar. I hope Jake is nominated for a supporting Oscar(he was strangely omitted at the Golden Globes???)

Epic and majestic in grandeur in performances and production values, this is a film which will remain with you long after the credits are done rolling.  Anyone who is dealing with unrequited love or a love that they can't have for whatever reason will gain a new perspective of the emotion after watching this film.  Its not a simple matter of lust, co-dependency, infatuation or all the cliche ridden adjectives that describe love.  Love is an emotional bonding and connection between two people ...it is unconditional....looking beyond the faults and seeing only the good.  This film establishes that fact and what is heartbreaking is that many people will see this and condemn it for being a love story between two men.  This film should have won the Oscar....it is so meaningful in so many ways.  Yet, I knew that homophobic hollywood would never bestow its highest honor on this film because of the ""gay theme"".  Instead, they bestowed it on a worthless picture ""Crash"" which in no way can ever compare to the beauty in ""Brokeback Mountain"".  The performances are unforgettable...although you may want to put the subtitles on because Heath Ledger's dialogue is hard to understand....he mumbles so much.  Much better is Jake Gyllenhaal's performance as Jack Twist who is magnificent.  He tears the heart right out of you....especially during the last confrontation scene with Ledger.  One feels his pain.  This is not to say that Ledger isn't good, he certainly is...he is excellent.  They both play off each other beautifully.  No less magnificent is Michelle Williams as Alma, Ledger's wife.  A sad pathos is manifested in her performance and she should have received an Oscar for her performance.

It was just the right vehicle with which to go mainstream with a gay love story.It starts in 1963, when Ennis and Jack spend the summer as sheepherders (not cowboys, although Jack also does rodeos) on Brokeback Mountain. In a scene that seemed completely authentic to someone with no personal experience of homosexuality but plenty experience in sexuality, they end up making love one night in their tent. And we have to say making love, not having sex. There is real feeling here along with the masculine horseplay. Thus begins a loving friendship that lasts over 20 years, mostly on ""fishing trips"" and other camping adventures away from wives and prying eyes.Remember this starts in 1963, long before the word ""gay"" had been developed as a healthy way to describe male homosexuality. They had a lot nastier terms in those days. And Ennis remembers when he was a child, his Daddy took him and his brother to view the remains of a man who had been mutilated and killed for being one of a couple of men who lived together. Understand this: he did NOT happen upon the corpse accidentally; his daddy took him to see it. As Ennis said, he probably was one of the people that did it.So naturally they want no one to know about their relationship. Thus the movie explores some of the hazards of closets.OK, no spoilers here. But you definitely do not have to be gay, or even bi, to appreciate this movie. That is exactly what's so valuable about it. Even straights can have real sympathy for the two close friends, likable guys, who look the part, but just don't quite fit the stereotype of the he-man of the western mountains, the rodeo and the ranch.",5,"Movie-Making Breakthrough, and a Great Story as Well",1337385600,"05 19, 2012",2012,1687,"['movie', 'needed', 'be', 'made', 'was', 'just', 'right', 'vehicle', 'go', 'mainstream', 'gay', 'love', 'story.It', '1963', 'when', 'Ennis', 'Jack', 'spend', 'summer', 'sheepherders', 'not', 'cowboys', 'Jack', 'also', 'rodeos', 'Brokeback', 'Mountain', 'scene', 'seemed', 'completely', 'authentic', 'someone', 'personal', 'experience', 'homosexuality', 'plenty', 'experience', 'sexuality', 'end', 'up', 'making', 'love', 'one', 'night', 'tent', 'have', 'say', 'making', 'love', 'not', 'having', 'sex', 'real', 'feeling', 'here', 'along', 'masculine', 'horseplay', 'Thus', 'loving', 'friendship', '20', 'years', 'mostly', 'fishing', 'trips', 'other', 'camping', 'adventures', 'away', 'wives', 'prying', 'eyes.Remember', '1963', 'long', 'word', 'gay', 'had', 'been', 'developed', 'healthy', 'way', 'describe', 'male', 'homosexuality', 'had', 'lot', 'nastier', 'terms', 'days', 'Ennis', 'remembers', 'when', 'was', 'child', 'Daddy', 'took', 'brother', 'view', 'remains', 'man', 'who', 'had', 'been', 'mutilated', 'killed', 'being', 'one', 'couple', 'men', 'who', 'lived', 'together', 'Understand', 'did', 'NOT', 'happen', 'corpse', 'accidentally', 'daddy', 'took', 'see', 'Ennis', 'said', 'probably', 'was', 'one', 'people', 'did', 'it.So', 'naturally', 'want', 'one', 'know', 'relationship', 'Thus', 'movie', 'hazards', 'closets.OK', 'spoilers', 'here', 'definitely', 'do', 'not', 'have', 'be', 'gay', 'even', 'bi', 'appreciate', 'movie', 'exactly', 'what', 'so', 'valuable', 'Even', 'straights', 'can', 'have', 'real', 'sympathy', 'two', 'close', 'friends', 'likable', 'guys', 'who', 'look', 'part', 'just', 'do', ""n't"", 'quite', 'fit', 'stereotype', 'he-man', 'western', 'mountains', 'rodeo', 'ranch']",N/A

He hasn't, So Jack Twist goes on reluctantly with his life, and he also gets married (More for financial reasons than love)  4 years pass.Jack writes a letter to Enis saying he will be there for a visit. When he shows, all those old feelings resurface, and they head back to Brokeback, and it continues that way throughout the years, and through the years Enis rejects the idea of settling down together as a couple because of a gay-hate killing he saw as a child.The movie moves along nicely, to show the ups and downs of not only thier relationship, but thier relationships to others, thier friends and families throughout the years.There is a very heartfelt ending to this movie that I won't give away, but it will leave you thinking about ""Brokeback Mountain"" long after it is over.The acting is phenominal, the setting is beautiful, and the directing is flawless.

We live in such a troubled time where the most important thing should be for all people to be accepted totally - whatever their sex, race, age, color or sexual identity.  The hate reviews here really do trouble me for the hate really isn't for the people they are attacking but comes from within the people themselves.  The only people capable of such hate are those who have it within themselves and must look at themselves first.That aside, let me review the brilliant masterpiece that is BROKEBACK MOUNTAIN.  The film is beautiful in every way.  Spellbinding cinematography, amazing script and actors giving some of the best performances of their career.  This film for all its grandeur is a simplistic, realistic love story for the ages.  Some have called it the gay GONE WITH THE WIND.  The most important thing here is that none of the characters are stereotypes.  Yes, the relationship is between two men but that is not the purpose of the film.  It is not a gay message film.  It is a love message film.  When two people connect in that special way that enables them to share their hearts, souls and celebrate it through the beauty of sexual expression it is a gift for any two people be they man/woman, woman/woman or man/man.  When this unique transcending true love is actualized it can happen between any two people.  A man who lives his life straight may find it with one other special man.  He may not be what we define as gay.  His love is for this man.  With this man gone he may desire no other man.  True love is such a gift and should never be denied.  And shame on anyone who tries to deny others from having it.Here we see that kind of love happen for Ennis and Jack.  The intimacy they feel takes the two of them by surprise and they develop a bond that only comes with true love.  The film shows us how they both deal with this love and how it affects their lives and other interpersonal relationships.  Heath Ledger and Jeke Gyllenhaal are spellbinding here and attack their characterizations with true honesty no holds barred.  The other stand out is Michelle Williams in a ground breaking, career making performance as Ennis's wife.  Her journey could have been so stereotypical but in her hands it is a splendind self realized exploration a woman must endure.The story here is romantic, tragic, happy sad and a timeless tale.  The blu ray version is astounding.  This film was made for it and it will seem like viewing the picture for the first time.  The 1080p high def picture is astounding.  The scenery pops with immense clarity, colors are crisp and close ups have perfect flesh tones.  The dialogue comes out strong and the beautiful music soars through the speakers as this beautiful tale is told.This film should definitely have won best picture but the fact that it got so many nominations is enough I guess.  I pray for the day when we as a society celebrate love pure and simple with no other issues mattering.

(It was her short story that the film is based on.) Prouix described how she had wrestled with finishing the tale for years, and had a much harder time with it than she had had with her longer works. (BTW, her book THE SHIPPING NEWS is a brilliant novel and a pretty good movie.)Anyway, Prouix did eventually finish the story, but had absolutely nothing to do with the filming of this movie. And here is the telling moment: Authors are almost always dissatisfied in some ways with the films of their work, particularly when they are not associated with the movie project as creative consultant or some such.Not Annie. She was absolutely floored that the movie had stayed so true to her story's original tone and purpose, and even substantially expanded upon it. (The fact the adapted screenplay won an Oscar for Larry McMurtry and Diane Ossana is a testament to its excellence.)

Ang Lee has succeeded in creating something so visceral, so moving, so elusive and infinite in its meanings that twenty years from now, we'll still being try to decipher it.While some of the reviewers have referred to Jack and Ennis as 'unsympathetic' characters, I would rather use the word, 'human.' Yes, human.  A story about two deeply flawed and deeply scarred human beings who struggle to find a way to that which redeems us all: love.  Ennis and Jack's struggle is a universal one, that of loving somebody in the fullest and most elemental sense of the word.  That is why this film is for us all, regardless of sexual persuasion.  BBM is an epic tale about the costs of loving somebody whom your world, your family and even yourself deems to be unacceptable or just plain 'wrong.'From the minute we see them, Ennis and Jack are more than just gruff ranch hands thrown together by the whims of fate.  As he  gets out of his beat-up pick-up and very deliberately saunters(dare I say, sexily) towards an Ennis caught in the burn of his gaze, Gyllenhaal's Jack Twist is out for something.  And that something just happens to be Ennis Del Mar.  As he spies Ennis through his side mirror whilst shaving, Jack is a man under a spell.  Unconciously or consciously, acting on his desire for Ennis is just a matter of time.  As both men move up the mountain, the ball between them starts to roll, picking up momentum with each gorgeous shot of the Canadian Rockies.  Ledger's Ennis wears the face of man fighting back every feeling he might have, and feelings for Jack especially.  But feelings and desire have 'no reins on them' as Ennis accurately points out.  Both characters slowly succomb to these feelings as their time on Brokeback passes.  Ang is the master of the tiny things that speak volumes. Whether its his intense concentration NOT to look at the naked Ennis or his child-like concern over Ennis' wounds, Jack indulges in his initial fascination and lets himself be ready for the moment.  And that moment soon comes with one of the most raw and REAL portrayals of homoerotic passion you'll see this side of pornography.  While born of the moment, Jack and Ennis' explosion is the culmination of their evolving and very unacknowledged desire for one another.  How this scene could have surprised and/or shocked anybody is beyond me.  All the signs were there, you just had to be looking.Like the black and white of a checkerboard, Ledger and Gyllenhaal complement each other like few other on-screen lovers have. Gyllenhaal's performance is nothing if not amazing.  How a straight actor could manage to capture Jack's open yearning for another man so perfectly, so precisely, is simply miraculous.  Jake's Twist is almost innocent in his near-joyful acceptance of the possibility that Brokeback offers.  He is the ennabler of the relationship, always looking for the road down the mountain where their fire can be continued. Yet, even Twist is confused by what this could all mean.  'Me neither,' he replies to Ennis' adamant declaration of not being 'queer.'  Part of the film's excruciating beauty is that both characters never really come to terms with who they are.  Men who love each other.No ride off here into the sunset. Ennis and Jack are the products of their time.  1963 America, where every man had to be JFK and every lady, Jackie.  And if you weren't, you'd best keep it to yourself, far in the closet, far from Mr. Kinsey.  More than that, BBM's world is rural, frontier, hardscrabble 1963 America where the mere idea of two men loving each other represents an assault on that most precious icon of Americana, the cowboy.  The laconic champion of simple goodness who stands for justice and defends the weak against the guys in black hats.  Falling in love with another cowboy ain't in the scipt and that's what makes Jack and Ennis' love so heroic, so fragile, so ultimately doomed.So you've had sex a couple of times with a buddy out in the boondocks and now it's time to come back into the rigid, heterosexual world of 1960's America. What's a queer cowhand to do?  Get married, sire a couple of kids and try to put it all behind you.  Jack and Ennis follow suit, but nature can't be held back.  Their first meeting after their marriages has to be one of the most passionate and tortured film 'kisses,' if that's the word one can use here, you'll ever see. Ledger and Gyllenhaal will leave you in a whirlwind.  As will Michelle William with her performance as Alma, Ennis' wife.  Alma's look of shock and disbelief as she stares through the glass window at her husband entwined in the arms and lips of another man is just one of the many grand cinematic moments in this film.  Alma's face is one of profound confusion. What just happened and what does it all mean?  Michelle Williams is indeed one of the highlights of BBM.  She doesn't need to say anything, her taut and pained expressions tell it all. A woman struggling to pick up the pieces of her shredded dream with dignity and self-respect.  Moreover, Ann Hathaway does a stellar job as Laureen Newsome, Jack's attractive Texas wife, a woman captivated by Twist's bull-riding prowess and boyish smile only to gradually learn what Alma knows early on.As the years drag by, both men settle for the costs and freedoms of the double life.  Fishing trips to Brokeback a couple times a year and then back to the lie with their women and families.  A lot has been mentionned already about the extreme damage both men cause their families.  And the claim is valid enough, if not too realistic.  Proulx and Lee wanted to show characters of THEIR time, crippled and blinded by THEIR circumstances, by THEIR environments and not least, by themselves.  After having witnessed the horrid aftermath of a hate crime as a young child, is it any wonder that Ennis has become a walking time bomb, striking out at anybody rather than admit he might not be all that different from the old rancher his father murdered.  Think about it people, most of us in Ennis' situation would have also strived for the so-called 'normal' life.Like Twain's Mississippi, Lee and Proulx's Brokeback is a mythical place.  Lee's masterful use of the West's untouched natural grandeur is without parallel.  Is not the mountain the third character in this relationship?  A place where the two lovers, like Adam and Eve, can act out their feelings in complete harmony with their surroundings.  A place unfettered by social constraint, tradition, expectation.  A place which allows Jack and Ennis to do that which should come most easily, to love.  Brokeback is a profoundly 'American' place, far from the maddening crowd, a place where self-limitation and painful compromise are unknown.  A place where it's all up to you to create your own heaven and/or hell.  Yet, such freedom comes at a heavy price. As Jack rightly says, 'Brokeback is all we got!'  What was once their playground of freedom, soon becomes their prison, their hideaway from the lies of their everyday lives.  Jack had the answer once.  He was willing to give this 'thing' a chance.  A ranch together, a life together...but Ennis's fear is just too much to overcome.  'Two men living together...if you can't fix it, you gotta stand it.'  And with such stoicism, Ennis nails the lid to both their coffins.  Denied the only one he ever really wanted, Jack looks elsewhere for his Ennis substitutes, which eventually lead to his ignominious murder.  Yet, could he have done otherwise?  Could he have been strong enough to forget Ennis Del Mar and cut off their relationship completely?  Are any of us strong enough to deny ourselves true love when it comes our way?  Is Ennis to blame for driving Jack to his death, for fostering his own emotional death due to his inability to conquer fear?  Who can judge? Certainly not us.  Such is the complexity of Ang Lee's art that it defies our natural desire to point the finger at the characters.Brokeback finishes on the same note it began, one of omnipresent sorrow and unbearable longing, longing destined to be unfulfilled. Shattered by Jack's murder and more importantly, by his own culpability in it, Ennis Del Mar has become a violent and empty shell of a man when his loving daughter, Alma Jr.(played brilliantly by newcomer Kate Mara), invites him to her wedding.  When asked whether her boyfriend truly loves her, she replies, 'Yes, Daddy, he does.' Ennis winces in pain, in regret at not having done like his daughter, at not having accepted love when it came his way.With Ennis's faintly voiced, 'I swear...,' a great American film closes.  And so much more than that.  A biting and gritty lesson on how lives should and should not be lived.  The reasons for watching BBM, repeatedly I might add, are many. More than anything, BBM should be seen and seen again as an example, par excellence, as to what a genius with a camera is capable of creating.  Ang Lee's visual poetry, similar to that of another maverick director, Terence Malick, is breathtaking.  Whether it be a single tear down a cheek, a look up at the camera in fear and confusion, icy red lips before the phone or the ultimate cowboy posing before the rocket's red glare, Lee manages to create scenes that will remain in you long after the lights are up.  Like a Hucklberry Finn of its day, Brokeback Mountain is more than just an indignant cry against injustices that remain with us still.  It's all that and so much more...",5,So much more...,1147478400,"05 13, 2006",2006,9920,"['just', ""'gay"", 'cowboy', 'movie', 'also', 'just', 'that', 'Two', 'rough', 'tumble', 'unschooled',

It's really well acted, particularly by Heath Ledger, Jake Gyllenhaal and Michelle Williams, brilliantly written, original and incredibly moving. Most critics have acknowledged this. But what makes BROKEBACK MOUNTAIN such a revelation is because it's a gay movie. That's what makes the film important. That's where it breaks new ground. That's why it matters. A friend of mine says that the only reason the film is generating so much buzz is because it's gay, that if it were a straight Western romance it wouldn't garner attention. I told him he was right, but I told him it was because his ""straight Western romance"" had already been made. Many people have commented that the film's theme is universal, applicable to all audiences. Sheep herders Jack and Ennis find themselves in love in 1963 and don't have a context with which to deal with those feelings. Those who speak of a ""universal theme"" say that BROKEBACK MOUNTAIN is about a romance that its lovers cannot deny yet cannot make work. This is all true, but I think it's unfair to the movie to say that it's really about ""everyone."" I am a gay man, and I couldn't divorce myself from that while watching this movie. Part of the reason I liked it is because I felt, while it was happening, like it belonged to me and spoke for me as a homosexual. I felt its impact, its originality. I wanted to nurture it and tell other people about it. I wanted to learn from it, and I wanted others to see it and learn. It's a story that I've been waiting for, even though I didn't know it. The documentary THE CELLULOID CLOSET, released several years ago, showed us Hollywood's history of how it subtly hid yet depicted homosexuality. If gay people wanted to see gay stories, they had to go into straight movies and ""decode"" the hidden gay themes. With BROKEBACK MOUNTAIN, gay people are, for once, not the ones who have to dig in order to relate to the film's ""universal"" message.

There really cannot be enough good things said about this film.It tells the story of Jack Twist and Ennis Del Mar, two simple cowboys who one summer go up to work at Brokeback Mounatin, and long story short, end up falling in love.  The rest of the movie follows their relationship and the few times they meet over the next 20 years.The direction is perfect, what else can be said?  Ang Lee deserves the Oscar, as he will likely get it.  The scenery alone is worth the price of admission, and I gasped several times just seeing it.The performances will break your heart as well.  Who thought Heath Ledger was capable of giving such a powerful performance after his recent movies, but he does.  Jake Gyllenhaal, Anne Hathaway, Michelle Williams, and my personal crush Linda Cardellini also do magnificent jobs.Overall, Brokeback Mountain should be seen by everyone; not just for the political message, which is in itself important, but also to see the best movie of the year, and a landmark cinematic experience.

Laureen was blind throughout the entire film until Ennis talked to her after Jack's passing and she put one and one together. Ennis was the character that had the most troubling conflict. He had trouble coming to terms with his relationship with Jack.  He despised Jack's crusing trips to Mexico. Ennis was loyal to his family and Jack. As for Jack, he was shunned by his father, an emotionless marriage, and his father in law. Something had to snap inside of him and that's was why he went to Mexico. Like I said everyone suffered in this film. It's sad, but in the end minus Jack everyone moved on with their lives. The film was well written and well acted.

Unable to be together, but unable to be themselves apart, it can apply to any type of relationship.  Seeing the movie in the theater, I was left feeling somewhat disappointed, as if there should have been more.  Although I thought it was excellent and that Ang Lee had once again captured a place and time so well (and without the usual movie-cliche' touchstones) that despite how foreign it may be to me personally, it seemed very real.  However, as I left the theater I felt rather numb and by the time I got to the subway at the corner, I burst into tears.  Every time I thought about the movie over the next few days, which was frequently, I did again.  I could not say why at the time, but there was something very, very deep in this movie that went to my soul.

172388,A1ZWDTXSH1ZV8E,1417030321,B. Martin,"[5, 10]","After viewing Brokeback Mountain, or as some like to peg it, ""the gay cowboy movie"", I found myself having to defend it's merits in a debate with my brother.  He made two key arguments:  first, that the love story involved two gay men was a mere ploy to make the movie seem more important than it really is and second, that Heath Ledger's character, Ennis, was let off the hook by the film's ending.  So I'm going to begin this review by responding to each of those criticisms.  There is no doubt that the fact that the two main characters in this movie are gay men is to push an agenda.  But it's not a gay rights agenda.  It's a human rights agenda.  Yes, the movie garnered attention because of its subject matter, but that's the point.  The film wants us to realize that love and desire do not discriminate.  It can find anyone, be it a heterosexual, interracial or gay couple.  By presenting us with two gay men as leads, the film challenges our ingrained predjudices right off the bat.  Surely this will be a movie that will make even the most open minded individual a bit uncomfortable, right?  Wrong.  The genius is that as soon as this beautiful film starts to unspool, we forget that we are watching two gay men.  Jack and Ennis could be any couple who are separated from one another by society's constraints (think interracial couples, rich kid/poor kid, etc.).  They become two human beings who find love with one another but never realize it due to their own fears and the expectations of others.  The movie's goal is to change hearts and minds and in order to do that, it has to prove to its viewers that we are all human and victims of our own emotions and desires, regardless of our sexual orienttion.  If the movie had spent the entire time preaching about the prejudices of society and hammering us over the head with a blatant gay rights agenda, I would have agreed with my brother's first point.His second point does have some merit.  In one reagard, the ending of the film lets Ennis off the hook in the sense that he never has to step forward and make a choice; to continue living a lie or to come to terms with his true nature and make a life with Jack.  In real life, most people faced with Ennis' choice would probably do nothing and simply watch as time passed them by.  So I agree that Ennis did get out of having to make a choice.  But here is what my brother's argument misses:  although Ennis has the choice taken away from him, he does not get to escape the guilt and loss that will live with him for the rest of his days.  He doesn't get to decide whether or not he is going to be haunted by his indecision and he will never get an opportunity to change what could have been.  But is it possible, that by having this choice taken away from him, he will grow and learn and in the future he will act on opportunities?  Sometimes the only way people learn is by their mistakes.Oh, and as for the movie, it's skillfully directed by Ang Lee and the performances are superb.  Jake Gylenhall is great as Jack, the man who is more in touch with his needs and desperrately wants a life with Ennis.  But it is Ledger, as Ennis, who gives this movie its heart.  In Ledger's performance Ennis is a man who doesn't understand his own emotions.  He reacts with anger and violence whenever his regular life bumps up against the urges that are rumbling beneath the surface.  He says more about his loneliness, yearning and anger with downward glances and barely intelligible mumbles than other actors could have with lenghty soliloquies.In essence, Brokeback Mountain is an old-fashioned, tragic love story that never resorts to cheap sentiment and keeps its emotions largely in check....much like its wounded, lost soul, Ennis.",4,"A simple, devastating love story",1227312000,"11 22, 2008",2008,3744,"['viewing', 'Brokeback', 'Mountain', 'peg', 'gay', 'cowboy', 'movie', 'found', 'having', 'defend', 'merits', 'debate', 'brother', 'made', 'two', 'key', 'arguments', 'first', 'love', 'story', 'involved', 'two', 'gay', 'men', 'was', 'mere', 'ploy', 'make', 'movie', 'seem', 'more', 'important', 'really', 'second', 'Heath', 'Ledger', 'character', 'Ennis', 'was', 'let', 'off', 'hook', 'film', 'ending', ""'m"", 'going', 'begin', 'review', 'responding', 'criticisms', 'doubt', 'fact', 'two', 'main', 'characters', 'movie', 'are', 'gay', 'men', 'push', 'agenda', 'not', 'gay', 'rights', 'agenda', 'human', 'rights', 'agenda', 'Yes', 'movie', 'garnered', 'attention', 'subject', 'matter', 'point', 'film', 'realize', 'love', 'desire', 'do', 'not', 'discriminate', 'can', 'find', 'anyone', 'be', 'heterosexual', 'interracial', 'gay', 'couple', 'presenting', 'two', 'gay', 'men', 'leads', 'film', 'ingrained', 'predjudices', 'right', 'bat', 'Surely', 'will', 'be', 'movie', 'will', 'make', 'even', 'most', 'open', 'minded', 'individual', 'bit', 'uncomfortable', 'right', 'Wrong', 'genius', 'as', 'soon', 'beautiful', 'film', 'unspool', 'forget', 'are', 'watching', 'two', 'gay', 'men', 'Jack', 'Ennis', 'could', 'be', 'couple', 'who', 'are', 'separated', 'one', 'society', 'constraints', 'think', 'interracial', 'couples', 'rich', 'kid/poor', 'kid', 'etc.', 'become', 'two', 'human', 'beings', 'who', 'find', 'love', 'one', 'never', 'realize', 'due', 'own', 'fears', 'expectations', 'others', 'movie', 'goal', 'change', 'hearts', 'minds', 'order', 'do', 'prove', 'viewers', 'are', 'human', 'victims', 'own', 'emotions', 'desires', 'regardless', 'sexual', 'orienttion', 'movie', 'had', 'spent', 'entire', 'time', 'preaching', 'prejudices', 'society', 'hammering', 'head', 'blatant', 'gay', 'rights', 'agenda', 'would', 'have', 'agreed', 'brother', 'first', 'point.His', 'second', 'point', 'have', 'merit', 'one', 'reagard', 'ending', 'film', 'Ennis', 'hook', 'sense', 'never', 'step', 'forward', 'make', 'choice', 'continue', 'living', 'lie', 'come', 'terms', 'true', 'nature', 'make', 'life', 'Jack', 'real', 'life', 'most', 'people', 'faced', 'Ennis', 'choice', 'would', 'probably', 'do', 'nothing', 'simply', 'watch', 'time', 'passed', 'agree', 'Ennis', 'did', 'get', 'having', 'make', 'choice', 'here', 'what', 'brother', 'argument', 'Ennis', 'choice', 'taken', 'away', 'not', 'get', 'escape', 'guilt', 'loss', 'will', 'live', 'rest', 'days', ""n't"", 'get', 'decide', 'not', 'going', 'be', 'haunted', 'indecision', 'will', 'never', 'get', 'opportunity', 'change', 'what', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'possible', 'having', 'choice', 'taken', 'away', 'will', 'grow', 'learn', 'future', 'will', 'act', 'opportunities', 'Sometimes', 'only', 'way', 'people', 'learn', 'mistakes.Oh', 'movie', 'skillfully', 'directed', 'Ang', 'Lee', 'performances', 'are', 'superb', 'Jake', 'Gylenhall', 'great', 'Jack', 'man', 'who', 'more', 'touch', 'needs', 'desperrately', 'life', 'Ennis', 'Ledger', 'Ennis', 'who', 'movie', 'heart', 'Ledger', 'performance', 'Ennis', 'man', 'who', ""n't"", 'understand', 'own', 'emotions', 'anger', 'violence', 'whenever', 'regular', 'life', 'bumps', 'up', 'urges', 'are', 'rumbling', 'surface', 'more', 'loneliness', 'yearning', 'anger', 'downward', 'glances', 'barely', 'intelligible', 'mumbles', 'other', 'actors', 'could', 'have', 'lenghty', 'soliloquies.In', 'essence', 'Brokeback', 'Mountain', 'old-fashioned', 'tragic', 'love', 'story', 'never', 'cheap', 'sentiment', 'emotions', 'largely', 'check', '.much', 'wounded', 'lost', 'soul', 'Ennis']",N/A

I'm happy to say that the hype is well justified, as ""Brokeback Mountain"" is indeed a magnificient, flawlessly acted and directed, landmark film and the ultimate ""love story"" for our age.Two down-on-their-luck young cowboys, Ennis (Heath Ledger) and Jack (Jake Gyllenhaal), accept a summer job from a burly rancher (Randy Quaid) to tend a herd of sheep on Brokeback Mountain in Wyoming.  The closeness of working together leads to a physical and romantic relationship, one which Jack doesn't want to lose after the job is ended.  But this being Wyoming in the 1960's, the genuine affection they felt for each other was repressed in some ""good ol' boy"" horsing around, and they went their separate ways, with Jack going back to his family in Texas.  Several years later, and both married with children, they meet again and rekindle their relationship, getting together at Brokeback Mountain for regular ""fishing trips"" which Ennis' wife eventually gets wise about.  When Ennis' marriage ends, Jack shows up, willing to end his own marriage if Ennis would agree they should be together.  It has been almost 20 years since they first got together, but Ennis still assumes a ""macho cowboy"" facade and insists they cannot be together, despite an emotionally-wretching scene when they agree not to see each other for a while.  Keep the tissues handy for this one.Nominated for 7 Golden Globe Awards, including Best Picture, Best Director (Ang Lee, who absolutely redeemed himself for subjecting us to ""The Hulk""), Best Actor (Heath Ledger, who showed an acting range of raw emotion not evident in any of his earlier work), Best Supporting Actress (Michelle Williams, who played Ledger's wife, and is today his real life live-in girlfriend and mother of the baby they recently had together), Best Screenplay and Best Original Song (""A Love That Will Never Grow Old"").  ""Brokeback Mountain"" also won 8 other awards at various film festivals and critic competitions,  and is sure to be a contender at Oscar time as well ... and it is all well deserved.Don't think of it as a ""gay movie"" or modern western.  Think of it as a parable of our times, and how our society can often keep true love from prevailing.  It's a message that anyone can relate to, and everyone can't help but feel.

A story that could possibly shock due to the two men looking and behaving as typical family men involved with women and children...who fall hard for each other. The perfectly cast leads not only excel in their acting but capture the essence of the intensely passionate relationship that seemingly develops out of the blue between two handsome,masculine,rugged cowboys hired to manage a flock of sheep in a spectacularly majestic mountain setting. An environment so outrageously romantic and isolated that it's impossible to imagine resisting any kind of attraction from occuring...between any two human beings.This beautifully handled film allows anyone who watches it to identify with the emotions of erotic attraction,electric passion, tender romance,internal conflict,dramatic tragedy and life changing loss that are a big part of the human experience. The elegant, leisurely pace and classic-mythic-cinematography heightens the gut-wrenching story as it unfolds.A stunning achievement in all catagories that sets a new standard for cinematic love-story-telling for the 21st century. A classic love between opposites that anyone can relate to and identify with ,opposites not in gender, but in personality and spirit. One cowboy is the optimistic extrovert who wants it all with his man by his side and the cowboy he falls for, is the emotionally tortured intovert....who owns the film from his first shot. Mr.Gyllenhaal and Mr.Ledger's on-screen couple has become a modern legend. It'll be a long time before anyone will be able to out do this work by a pair of intelligent, brave, extremely secure and gifted actors at the peak of their craft....who really understood and felt the characters and the difficulty of this very complicated, highly emotional situation. How fantastically refreshing to see homosexual desire portrayed by two very believably masculine young men with absolutely no trace of any theatrical, selfconcious, Will & Jack style-""gay"" mannerisms. And in doing so, showing the world that there are plenty of ""regular"" men discreetly enjoying the ""power of love/lust"" privately with each other right under everyone's noses! Wishing Mr. Ledger's soul peace and love...he left us with a piece of work that will hopefully inspire people to seek  inner happiness by bravely facing one's inner, deeper truth. An important film for women to see to help them better understand those men who were never able to fully commit to them.",5,Cowboys in Love,1214438400,"06 26, 2008",2008,2581,"['Mr.', 'Lee', 'directed', 'romantic', 'masterpiece', '21st', 'century', 'magnificent', 'Brokeback', 'Mountain', 'creating', 'instant', 'classic', 'A', 'story', 'could', 'possibly', 'shock', 'due', 'two', 'men', 'looking', 'behaving', 'as', 'typical', 'family', 'men', 'involved', 'women', 'children', 'who', 'fall', 'hard', 'other', 'perfectly', 'cast', 'not', 'only', 'excel', 'acting', 'capture', 'essence', 'intensely', 'passionate', 'relationship', 'seemingly', 'blue', 'two', 'handsome', 'masculine', 'rugged', 'cowboys', 'hired', 'manage', 'flock', 'sheep', 'spectacularly', 'majestic', 'mountain', 'setting', 'environment', 'so', 'outrageously', 'romantic', 'isolated', 'impossible', 'imagine', 'resisting', 'kind', 'attraction', 'occuring', 'two', 'human', 'beings.This', 'beautifully', 'handled', 'film', 'allows', 'anyone', 'who', 'identify', 'emotions', 'erotic', 'attraction', 'electric', 'passion', 'tender', 'romance', 'internal', 'conflict', 'dramatic', 'tragedy', 'life', 'changing', 'loss', 'are', 'big', 'part', 'human', 'experience', 'elegant', 'leisurely', 'pace', 'classic-mythic-cinematography', 'heightens', 'gut-wrenching', 'story', 'stunning', 'achievement', 'catagories', 'new', 'standard', 'cinematic', 'love-story-telling', '21st', 'century', 'classic', 'love', 'opposites', 'anyone', 'can', 'relate', 'identify', 'not', 'gender', 'personality', 'spirit', 'One', 'cowboy', 'optimistic', 'extrovert', 'who', 'man', 'side', 'cowboy', 'emotionally', 'tortured', 'intovert', '.who', 'film', 'first', 'shot', 'Mr.Gyllenhaal', 'Mr.Ledger', 'on-screen', 'couple', 'become', 'modern', 'legend', ""'ll"", 'be', 'long', 'time', 'anyone', 'will', 'be', 'able', 'out', 'do', 'work', 'pair', 'intelligent', 'brave', 'extremely', 'secure', 'gifted', 'actors', 'peak', 'craft', '.who', 'really', 'understood', 'felt', 'characters', 'difficulty', 'very', 'complicated', 'highly', 'emotional', 'situation', 'How', 'fantastically', 'refreshing', 'see', 'homosexual', 'desire', 'portrayed', 'two', 'very', 'believably', 'masculine', 'young', 'men', 'absolutely', 'trace', 'theatrical', 'selfconcious', 'Will', 'Jack', 'style-', 'gay', 'mannerisms', 'doing', 'so', 'showing', 'world', 'are', 'plenty', 'regular', 'men', 'discreetly', 'enjoying', 'power', 'love/lust', 'privately', 'other', 'right', 'everyone', 'noses', 'Wishing', 'Mr', 'Ledger', 'soul', 'peace', 'love', 'left', 'piece', 'work', 'will', 'hopefully', 'inspire', 'people', 'seek', 'inner', 'happiness', 'bravely', 'facing', 'one', 'inner', 'deeper', 'truth', 'important', 'film', 'women', 'see', 'help', 'better', 'understand', 'men', 'who', 'were', 'never', 'able', 'fully', 'commit']",N/A

172396,A3HLRR2FL9E5DP,1417030321,Brian,"[26, 30]","Quite a few shallow individuals, it appears, are clinging to the false notion that this breathtaking and profoundly heart-wrenching motion picture offers nothing new or noteworthy. Having now experienced the film for myself, I can testify to you here that this is very simply not the case.Ang Lee has crafted the one feature film that audiences will be discussing for many long years to come. The buzz it generates, contrary to what some may otherwise believe, will not cater to the media's recent and over-exaggerated abuse of the words ""bravery"" or ""courage."" Especially not as such terms relate to Jake Gyllenhaal or Heath Ledger and their joint decision to star in this production. More specifically, I tend to believe that most of the talk ""Brokeback Mountain"" promotes will more than likely entail just how openly honest and heartfelt its story of true love really is. Director Lee is the one man who should be labelled brave. He, working directly from the Annie Proulx short story, has given us a revolutionary firsthand view of a deeply-rooted relationship that was, for the time period it was set against, considered gravely taboo. The year 1963, one must remember, was far and away removed from the tolerable climate of today's modern society. I had not been alive to experience the sixties, I grant you. But that doesn't necessarily mean I am unable to identify with the altogether cruel strife these characters endured. The heinous societal pressure hanging over Ennis Del Mar and Jack Twist cuts to the very core of what each and every gay person across this world has been forced to confront. Director Lee, with this film, has shined an ever-revealing light upon the ignorance of bigotry and the unfortunate lengths its victims must travel to avoid the rejection of friends and family. We feel the angst within Jack and Ennis, their sheer emotional passion and, ultimately, the genuine frustration of realizing they can never openly embrace their mutual attraction. It all comes down to fear. You should never be afraid to love another person, regardless of whether a total stranger agrees with it or not. My entire adolesence had passed me by before I realized that truth for myself at the age of twenty one.I and my spouse of fourteen years were in a theater, way out in the suburbs, on opening day to experience this film amongst a packed house with varying cross-sections of people young and old alike. Not a single one of them, I should mention, got up and left throughout the entire showing. There are simply no sufficient words for me to adequately describe just how powerful and totally touching this movie's driving message proved. In my entire life, I cannot recall a time I ever saw so many members of the crowd as positively touched as they were by ""Brokeback Mountain."" This is clearly one feature film that everybody should award its proper due. It may not change the minds of those who unfortunately still shun homosexuality in general. But, I can almost certainly guarantee, that it will open many eyes to a truth that those in higher authority still choose to ignore. Love, no matter how you may look at it, is what it is and is never wrong.I will be recommending this movie to everybody I know for as long as the air in my lungs will permit me to do so. It deserves every one of the nominations it has received and is a definite contender for Best Picture. Ang Lee, Ms. Proulx, take a bow and thank you both very much.",5,"A well made, heartfelt drama with a profound and powerful message.

172400,A3JPFWKS83R49V,1417030321,"Bryan Carey ""Bryan Carey""","[45, 51]","""Brokeback Mountain"" is a film based on a story of the same name, written by author E. Annie Proulx. This controversial film received quite a bit of talk when it was first released and it was the subject of many jokes by comedians of all types. The idea of two cowboy types who fall in love while working at a mountain ranch was just too irresistible to many and it made Brokeback Mountain the common [...] (no pun intended) of many jokes.Today, many months after its initial release, much of the hoopla has died down. Brokeback Mountain has now been released on DVD and this provided me my opportunity to watch this movie and see what the fuss was all about. I already knew the film received rave reviews and it was nominated for many Oscars, taking home three of them before the Academy Awards wrapped up the 2005 awards evening. But would Brokeback Mountain live up to the hype, I wondered, or would it be an idiotic mess of unrealistic events, stupid one- liners, and a case of ""pushing"" an issue (in this case, gay themes and rights) on the viewer?Now that I have watched this movie in its entirety, I am happy to report that Brokeback Mountain contains none of the negative qualities I described above. Director Ang Lee presents a movie that is tastefully made and that doesn't push any social agenda. Yes, the film does portray many adult scenes (like gay sex and straight sex), but it is done in as tasteful a way as possible. What takes place in this movie is probably not very far- fetched at all for the time period that it covers (1963 to 1981) and there are likely many viewers who will be able to relate directly to the plot of this movie and the confusion and frustration felt by its lead characters and their families as they struggle to sort out their feelings. Ennis and Jack have obvious feelings for each other but they feel they must keep their affair secret. They have families to support and they want to be seen as ""normal"" by those around them. Jack is more aggressive and he pushes Ennis to join him and start a permanent relationship. But Ennis resists and the strain it places on them and their respective families is significant and the emotional pain on the screen is openly visible.Ang Lee does a superb job directing this film and its no surprise that he won the Oscar for Best Director. The cinematography is excellent, with great scenes of the vast Rocky Mountains as they majestically pierce the bright blue skies above them. The direction he takes this film is nearly flawless as it follows the two main characters on their path from lustful attraction, to emotional involvement, to resistance and beyond. Intertwined are the problems experienced on the home front. Both men get married and start families, in spite of their obvious attraction to each other. Like many people during that era, they probably did this because it was assumed to be the right thing to do. But the difficulties it causes their two families are obvious, with Ennis' character experiencing the greatest domestic turmoil of the two. Not only does Ennis get divorced, he even allows himself to get involved in another relationship with a woman; this, in spite of the fact that he knows where his true interest and feelings lie.Heath Ledger plays Ennis Del Ray and his performance is near perfect. Ledger is only twenty- six years old but he plays the part of a man who is (at the end of the movie) in his forties. The make- up, the talk, and the attitude that Ledger projects into this character are very real and it's easy to see why he, too, was nominated for an Oscar. It took me a while to get used to Ennis' voice because he talks like someone with a hunk of chewing tobacco in his mouth. I had to replay some of the scenes to pick up on what he was saying. But the character was like this for a reason, most likely to make him similar to those who work in this type of occupation. Jake Gyllenhaal's character, Jack Twist, is very different from Ennis. He is more of a straight talker who says exactly what is on his mind and proceeds to work toward his goals. Gyllenhaal's performance isn't quite as good as Ledger's but it is still notable and still memorable.One thing I noticed about Brokeback Mountain is that it took me some time to warm- up to the main characters. They seemed so distant and casual about the whole thing at first that it was difficult to care what was going on. I found myself feeling more sympathetic toward the families who had to deal with the volatility of their respective fathers/husbands on a daily basis. However, as the film nears its end, the frustration felt by Jack and the stubbornness of Ennis got me more involved with the characters. I just wanted them to finally make up their minds one way or the other and it was much easier at this point to feel the frustration felt by Jack as he tried to persuade his friend that he wanted their relationship to be more than just a seasonal fling.Brokeback Mountain is a very good motion picture that will be remembered for years as one of 2005's best pictures. The cinematography, the performances, and the directing are all top- notch and the story of forbidden love is engaging and vivid. The film will likely remain controversial for its subject matter but regardless of your own personal feelings on this type of subject, ""Brokeback Mountain"" is a film I recommend watching. It presents a realistic look at what people who lived this life often experienced back when alternative lifestyles weren't as accepted as they are today.",4,"Two Cowboys, Multiple

At first, I was reticent to watch it because of the two men thing, but I got beyond that and saw it simply as a love story between two people who, due to societal circumstances, could not share their lives together.  The best part, I think, was seeing how they gradually fell in love and then to see the passion of that love.

Ennis and Jack are two young men who spend the summer of 1963 herding sheep in Wyoming on an isolated mountain in Wyoming. Ennis is the strong silent type in the Gary Cooper tradition, while Jack is more outgoing. During the two months they are together they become friends and then lovers. Had the time and place been different, they would have probably stayed together, based on the powerful scene in which they go their separate ways after that first summer. However, with the culture being that of the rugged mountain west and the time that of the early sixties, this was an impossibility. The reaction of their boss and Ennis' wife when they discover what is going on tells you what they could have looked forward to if they had been open about their relationship - muted ostracism by daylight, perhaps violence come nightfall. At first, the two just try to put their feelings for each other behind them. Ennis, already engaged, goes through with his marriage as planned and fathers two daughters. Jack goes back to Texas, meets and marries the daughter of a wealthy farm equipment dealer, and fathers a son. Four years after their initial separation, Jack returns to Wyoming and their relationship picks up where it left off - still a secret, this time on the pretext of week-long ""fishing trips"" they take two or three times a year for the next fifteen years, never able to tell anyone about their love, never able to show their affection in public. Many have mentioned that the two were just cheating on their wives all of this time, but the fact is if they had been able to follow their hearts, they would have never had wives to begin with.Much of what is great about this film is what is left unsaid. Is Ennis actually homosexual or did he just fall in love with someone who happened to be a man? Did Jack die the way his wife said he did or he way Ennis imagined? Did Jack lie to Ennis that last time they were together and say he was having an affair with a woman because he knew Ennis would be jealous of another man but not another woman? Did Jack deliberately take Ennis' shirt as a reminder of him that first summer or did he just find it and decide to keep it? The acting is tremendous, and I find myself mourning the tragedy of the characters in this film as though they were real people, although I'm sure their situation represents many real ones past and present. This is a beautiful and thoughtful film that definitely should have won the Best Picture Oscar. Jack and Ennis' double lives just leave themselves, their wives, and everyone else who is close to them feeling empty and just add up to time and opportunity lost. Only the unwritten rules of society and conformity come out the winner in this one.",5,This tragic and powerful love story will haunt you,1178409600,"05 6, 2007",2007,2855,"['film', 'love', 'lost', 'sake', 'keeping', 'up', 'appearances', 'end', 'just', 'everyone', 'involved', 'miserable', 'Ennis', 'Jack', 'are', 'two', 'young', 'men', 'who', 'spend', 'summer', '1963', 'herding', 'sheep', 'Wyoming', 'isolated', 'mountain', 'Wyoming', 'Ennis', 'strong', 'silent', 'type', 'Gary', 'Cooper', 'tradition', 'Jack', 'more', 'outgoing', 'two', 'months', 'are', 'together', 'become', 'friends', 'then', 'lovers', 'Had', 'time', 'place', 'been', 'different', 'would', 'have', 'probably', 'stayed', 'together', 'based', 'powerful', 'scene', 'go', 'separate', 'ways', 'first', 'summer', 'However', 'culture', 'being', 'rugged', 'mountain', 'west', 'time', 'early', 'sixties', 'was', 'impossibility', 'reaction', 'boss', 'Ennis', 'wife', 'when', 'discover', 'what', 'going', 'tells', 'what', 'could', 'have', 'looked', 'forward', 'had', 'been', 'open', 'relationship', 'muted', 'ostracism', 'daylight', 'perhaps', 'violence', 'come', 'nightfall', 'first', 'two', 'just', 'try', 'put', 'feelings', 'other', 'Ennis', 'already', 'engaged', 'marriage', 'planned', 'fathers', 'two', 'daughters', 'Jack', 'back', 'Texas', 'meets', 'daughter', 'wealthy', 'farm', 'equipment', 'dealer', 'fathers', 'son', 'Four', 'years', 'initial', 'separation', 'Jack', 'Wyoming', 'relationship', 'up', 'where', 'left', 'off', 'still', 'secret', 'time', 'pretext', 'week-long', 'fishing', 'trips', 'take', 'two', 'three', 'times', 'year', 'next', 'fifteen', 'years', 'never', 'able', 'tell', 'anyone', 'love', 'never', 'able', 'show', 'affection', 'public', 'Many', 'have', 'mentioned', 'two', 'were', 'just', 'cheating', 'wives', 'time', 'fact', 'had', 'been', 'able', 'follow', 'hearts', 'would', 'have', 'never', 'had', 'wives', 'begin', 'with.Much', 'what', 'great', 'film', 'what', 'left', 'unsaid', 'Ennis', 'actually', 'homosexual', 'did', 'just', 'fall', 'love', 'someone', 'who', 'happened', 'be', 'man', 'Did', 'Jack', 'die', 'way', 'wife', 'said', 'did', 'way', 'Ennis', 'imagined', 'Did', 'Jack', 'lie', 'Ennis', 'last', 'time', 'were', 'together', 'say', 'was', 'having', 'affair', 'woman', 'knew', 'Ennis', 'would', 'be', 'jealous', 'man', 'not', 'woman', 'Did', 'Jack', 'deliberately', 'take', 'Ennis', 'shirt', 'reminder', 'first', 'summer', 'did', 'just', 'find', 'decide', 'keep', 'acting', 'tremendous', 'find', 'mourning', 'tragedy', 'characters', 'film', 'were', 'real', 'people', ""'m"", 'sure', 'situation', 'many', 'real', 'ones', 'present', 'beautiful', 'thoughtful', 'film', 'definitely', 'should', 'have', 'won', 'Best', 'Picture', 'Oscar', 'Jack', 'Ennis', 'double', 'lives', 'just', 'leave', 'wives', 'everyone', 'else', 'who', 'close', 'feeling', 'empty', 'just', 'add', 'up', 'time', 'opportunity', 'lost', 'Only', 'unwritten', 'rules', 'society', 'conformity', 'come', 'winner', 'one']",N/A
172403,ANMJJITAF8PUG,1417030321,"Cambel ""cambel""","[894, 1034]","After watching this movie friends and I spent the next few hours discussing it.  It is a well done film no matter the subject, it is the story of two people in love who ache for each other and yet are forced to be apart.  Add to that the fact that both are men and the time is 1963 and you get the added story that makes this film particularly wrenching.  Jack and Enis meet when they are both hired to spend the summer up on Brokeback mountain tending to a herd of sheep.  Enis is quiet to the point of seeming almost mute and Jack is the more lively of the two.  One frozen night when huddled in the tent from the cold their supressed passion for each other becomes an irrisistable force and the two spend the remainder of their time on the mountain happy, or at least as happy as Enis's character can be.  Their summer ends with Jack saying that they could still be together and Enis being overcome with rage at the mere suggestion.  They last see each other as Jack is driving off and Enis is nonchalantly walking down a dirt street.  It is after Jack is gone that Enis breaks down in an unexpected and powerful scene, hiding in an ally-way so nobody will see.  Over the next several years they both marry and become fathers.  The scene of their reunion 4 years later has so much emotion, longing and passion that it will take your breath away.  They way they look at each other and that first kiss is one of the most powerful I've seen onscreen and I have to comend both actors.  This movie however is not just about Jack and Enis, but also shows the effect on their wives, Michelle Williams of Dawsons creek does an amazing job of playing the wife of Enis who discovers his secret but stays quiet because she sees no other option and Anne Hathaway saying Good-bye to her Princess Diary character with a flirty agreesive character and a topless scene as she sets her sight on Jack.  I won't go into the ending other than to say that the scene where Jacks parent are introduced is nearly as moving as their reunion scene and will leave you feeling wrung out.This is a film that will keep you invloved until the last credit on the screen goes blank and kudos to Ang Lee for putting such a memorable film onscreen.",5,Tears at your heart,1135209600,"12 22, 2005",2005,2216,"['watching', 'movie', 'spent', 'next', 'few', 'hours', 'discussing', 'well', 'done', 'film', 'matter', 'subject', 'story', 'two', 'people', 'love', 'who', 'ache', 'other', 'yet', 'are', 'forced', 'be', 'apart', 'Add', 'fact', 'are', 'men', 'time', '1963', 'get', 'added', 'story', 'film', 'particularly', 'wrenching', 'Jack', 'Enis', 'meet', 'when', 'are', 'hired', 'spend', 'summer', 'up', 'Brokeback', 'mountain', 'tending', 'herd', 'sheep', 'Enis', 'quiet', 'point', 'seeming', 'almost', 'mute', 'Jack', 'more', 'lively', 'two', 'One', 'frozen', 'night', 'when', 'huddled', 'tent', 'cold', 'supressed', 'passion', 'other', 'irrisistable', 'force', 'two', 'spend', 'remainder', 'time', 'mountain', 'happy', 'least', 'as', 'happy', 'Enis', 'character', 'can', 'be', 'summer', 'Jack', 'saying', 'could', 'still', 'be', 'together', 'Enis', 'being', 'overcome', 'rage', 'mere', 'suggestion', 'last', 'see', 'other', 'Jack', 'driving', 'off', 'Enis', 'nonchalantly', 'walking', 'down', 'dirt', 'street', 'Jack', 'gone', 'Enis', 'breaks', 'down', 'unexpected', 'powerful', 'scene', 'hiding', 'ally-way', 'nobody', 'will', 'see', 'next', 'several', 'years', 'marry', 'become', 'fathers', 'scene', 'reunion', '4', 'years', 'later', 'so', 'much', 'emotion', 'longing', 'passion', 'will', 'take', 'breath', 'away', 'way', 'look', 'other', 'first', 'kiss', 'one', 'most', 'powerful', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'onscreen', 'have', 'comend', 'actors', 'movie', 'however', 'not', 'just', 'Jack', 'Enis', 'also', 'effect', 'wives', 'Michelle', 'Williams', 'Dawsons', 'creek', 'amazing', 'job', 'playing', 'wife', 'Enis', 'who', 'secret', 'quiet', 'other', 'option', 'Anne', 'Hathaway', 'saying', 'Good-bye', 'Princess', 'Diary', 'character', 'flirty', 'agreesive', 'character', 'topless', 'scene', 'sight', 'Jack', 'wo', ""n't"", 'go', 'ending', 'other', 'say', 'scene', 'where', 'Jacks', 'parent', 'are', 'introduced', 'nearly', 'as', 'moving', 'reunion', 'scene', 'will', 'leave', 'feeling', 'wrung', 'out.This', 'film', 'will', 'keep', 'invloved', 'last', 'credit', 'screen', 'blank', 'kudos', 'Ang', 'Lee', 'putting', 'memorable', 'film', 'onscreen']",N/A

A beautiful film all around which boosts a beautiful and natural scenery that you will find to your enjoyment. If you care about films that are compelling and controversial because of its subject matter and excellence in acting you cannot miss this movie. It is nominated for seven Golden Globes including Best Picture and I am almost positive that it will receive a handful of Oscar nods as well. Brokeback Mountain is a gem of a movie one that really makes you think and analyze things and you will find this film is a story that is very much a part of the society that we live in because this sort of thing happens more often that we tend to think.

172407,A2FNA5903D9E6Y,1417030321,Carol Toscano,"[25, 26]","There are certain things that hit the viewer immediately the first time you see this film - the beauty of the landscape for one thing. And then there are these two young men who instantly strike you as solitary and singular. I must admit that I had a delayed reaction to this movie. When I walked out of the theatre, I wasn't as overwhelmed as I was a day or two later and I think the reason is because this film is one to be contemplated and thought about - a lot.First, the movie was described to me as a movie about g*y cowboys. That wasn't quite what I took away from it. Let's face it, if this were just a movie about g*y cowboy's trying to hide their lifestyle from everyone else, it would have been a completely different movie. There was something much deeper than sexuality at play - deeper on so many levels, frankly. What makes it even more reflective is that no explanations are offered for practically anything in the film. As a writer, one of the first things I learned was ""show, don't tell."" This is most definitely a ""show, don't tell"" film. One of the bigger questions I was left with (and still wonder about today) is why Ennis Del Mar (Heath Ledger) was so stricken with Jack Twist (Jake Gyllenhaal). You are left wondering what would have happened had Jack never reached for Ennis's hand in the tent that night - if they had just completed their sheepherding jobs and moved on. Would Ennis's life with his wife and kids have moved forward in the way that it had been going if Jack had not sent a postcard four years later? As the movie progresses, it becomes clear that Jack is more interested in men than women but you are never quite sure with Ennis (sometimes very sure and other times not sure at all). He doesn't pursue other men. There are no suggestions that he even looks at other men. There are scenes (before the postcard arrives) that leave you feeling that he is, in fact, in love with his wife and children. He even goes so far as to display some very macho behavior when some low-lifes at a fair use foul language in front of his ""girls."" When he gets divorced, he dates another woman, though you do feel that he's not fully ""present"" in that situation either. His unraveling as the years go by is all about Jack and it's almost as if his only reason to live are for his stolen moments with Jack on Brokeback Mountain. When he loses Jack for good, he is so emotionally shut down, that he nearly chooses to miss his own daughter's wedding.Jack, on the other hand, displays a clearer sense of self from the beginning. He is the more openly sensitive of the two, more skillful at getting needs met and taking initiative. More expressive in every way. But, as with Ennis, his life is fueled by their meetings on Brokeback Mountain, with a few detours along the way. There are questions left in your mind about Jack as well - it's never fully clear why he chose to marry since he seemed to have a sharper awareness of who he was and what he needed. And yet, he does seem smitten when he first meets his wife and has his baby. Was he just a product of the time and place he lived in (1960s Texas)? Could be. But this is all just part of what makes this movie so brilliant. You find yourself experiencing the film emotionally, not just watching it and that's very surprising (and somewhat disorienting) in a way. And, as with real life, there are so many unanswered questions - about ourselves, the world, life, death - that are never resolved.For the people who say that this is just Hollywood's attempt to ""legitimize"" or ""glamorize"" homosexuality - dudes, listen up: it's about the suffering these men went through and how awful their lives had become over time. There's nothing glamorous about any of it - just a lot of pain and misery. I never felt that the movie was pushing any type of lifestyle. It's just a story about two men in a certain time, place and situation and should be viewed that way.Ang Lee is an amazing director. Annie Proulx who wrote the short story that evolved into this film is the Pulitzer Prize winning author of The Shipping News. I believe Brokeback Mountain appeared in the New Yorker Magazine in 1997 or 1998 (fairly recent). I often wonder what she felt when she wrote this. The casting was spot on - Heath Ledger is an exceptional actor, no question (he gave a powerful performance in the film, The Order) but it is Jake Gyllenhaal who, for me, carried this film in a way that stirred up my insides (I was on his emotional ""I wish I knew how to quit you"" rollercoaster).I recommend this film, though I know it might not be for everyone (I hear that it's been banned in Utah, actually). And if you have that ""not sure"" feeling at first, I can guarantee that it will eventually settle.

172410,A3VIOCJZ22JZXT,1417030321,C. B Collins Jr.,"[50, 60]","Ang Lee's film, Brokeback Mountain, is one of those rare events that impacts not only the entertainment industry and its supporters, but also impacts our society by revealing truths of the human heart that may run counter to society's prescriptions and rules.It is a love story beween two men that emerges out of a totally unlikely place, the cowboy world of windswept Wyoming in 1963. Yet from those first dusty scenes where Ennis del Mar (played by Heath Ledger) and Jack Twist (played by Jake Gyllenhaal)are hired to herd sheep, we begin to see a beautiful world of high mountain pastures on Brokeback Mountain, where the pressures of society and civilization can be left behind and gradually these two men can shed the confines of prejudice and social roles and experience first physical and then emotional love for each other. To a certain extent, high above the world of civilization, in a more natural state, these two young men enter an Eden. It is a Garden of Eden first in its natural beauty and then second in the love that is allowed to flourish there. I use the term Eden because throughout the film, Ennis and Jack try to return there - to recapture the young love they felt for each other, and to meet their sexual needs.But civilization calls, and these two young men return to the lowlands, collect their pay, and painfully part ways. Ennis hits a brick wall with his bare fist in a hidden alley, for he is a man who is more comfortable with physical pain than emotional pain.  Jack returns to the worksite the following year, eager to relive the experience, but stopped by Randy Quaid, the foreman, as well as Ennis' decision not to show up again.Both men marry. Ennis marries a vulnerable country girl reared from the same strong stock of no-illusion people from which he was reared. Jack almost starves until he is picked by a rich cowgirl who has been denied nothing by her father. Anne Hathaway plays the wife of Jack. What is it about the man who desires other men that appears mysterious and unobtainable to some women? Part of the dynamic between Anne and Jack is that she is a young woman who has been given everything, yet she marries a man with a hidden ability to love inside that she will never be able to touch, she will only always remain aware that it is there and it is not meant for her.Michelle Williams plays Ennis' wife, Alma. Some of the most painful scenes of the film involve Alma as she gradually begins to learn the secrets of the silent man she has married. After 4 years, Jack writes a postcard to Ennis, asking if he would like to get together. Ennis responds and a date is determined. On the day that Jack is supposed to arrive, Ennis is a bundle of bad nerves, pacing, sad and fearful of a no-show, restless, depressed as a way to deal with his repressed longing, energized, agaitated at the kids, and this odd state of mind/body is certainly observed by his sensitive young wife. When Jack arrives, Ennis runs out of the house to greet him, pulls him from his truck, and the two men kiss with a flood of repressed love and lust and longing. Yet Alma opens the front door and observes this embrace and knows that this is a passion she has never experienced with Ennis.Jack Twist, played superbly by Jake Gyllenhaal, emerges as the character that is most emotionally available. He makes himself available to Ennis and is the most open to these two men divorcing their wives and becoming life partners. He is aware of his needs and has sex with other men beside Ennis. He is the one who continually pushes Ennis to experience the hidden rumblings of the heart.Ennis del Mar, played perfectly by Heath Ledger, is an emotionally more complex and stunted character. Yet it is the character growth of Ennis that in some ways is the real trajectory of the story. The trajectory of this story is not boy meets boy, boy loses boy, boy meets girl, boy loses girl, boy finally find boy again. It is rather a more complex path of self awareness where pain is the surgical tool that reveals Ennis to himself. He does lose Alma, he does lose Jack, but in the end we see a changed man. When an available attractive young woman begins to seduce him, he is pulled into her orbit due to his need for comfort from his loses. HOwever, he realizes he will never be happy with this young woman and she will never be fulfilled with him. He ends the budding romance in a way that tells us he has gained in wisdom and self knowledge. In the end we see Ennis as a wounded and broken fellow, destined to mourn the love he could have nourished and experienced, and yet we see him begin to celebrate the budding love of his eldest daughter.This is mature matter. We all make poor or uninformed or unconscious choices. We all treat life as if it would go on forever and we don't need to make hard choices because we will always get a second chance. These two men were not especially strong heroic fellows, they were victims of societal pressures and their own emotional boundaries and awareness. Sometimes we do our best to understand ourselves and the world and it still comes out a tragedy. Knowing this, we must be grateful for those times of communion of the heart, which come to us like grace, like an unsought gift, but which transforms us forever.",5,"Many meanings, many messages in

172411,A2IF6UKZCV0V0Y,1417030321,"C. Clay ""drakkar91""","[20, 30]","I just finished watching Brokeback Mountain.  I had heard many things about the movie: that is would leave me sobbing, that is was tragic, sad; most agreed it was well-deserving of it's Oscar nomination.Indeed, it was an excellent film about life, about love.  And if you have read any of my other reviews (or know me), you know that I very much enjoy films and stories that tug at our heartstrings and emotions.  Unlike Philadelphia, which left me sobbing at the end of the movie, this film was similar more so to the emotional strength of Torch Song Trilogy (minus Harvey Fierstein and some fabulous show tunes).The film takes us on a journey between 2 individuals (played well by Jake and Heath), and transports the viewer over 20 years, beginning in 1963.  The film is set mostly in Wyoming (though filmed in Canada).  It follows the emotional journey of 2 men who attempt to come to grips with their inner desires and sexuality.  After spending the summer of 1963 as ranch hands, both return to their ""normal"" lives, 1 in Wyoming, the other in Texas.  They marry, have children, and attempt to blend in with societal norms (just as some people try to do in 2006).  Years later, they reunite, and the emotional ties are even stronger.  As each year passes, they come together for a visit on Brokeback Mountain, where they first met and worked.This is not a gay cowboy film, hardly.  This IS a film about people, and how difficult it can be to care so deeply for another human being.  To love someone so much it hurts.  I am sure others watching the film like me can only hope we'll find someone in our life who will love us with so much courage and emotion.  This applies to people from all walks of life.As I watched the film, I couldn't help but think of Matthew Shepard, the young man from Wyoming who was brutally beaten and killed for his sexuality - sadly, his death occurred in 1998.  Proof our society has yet to understand the dynamics of love, set forth in this film.  After mainstream theaters decided they would cash in and show the film to general audiences (it was originally a limited release film, in ""select"" theaters), I read an article that described the ending as tragic.  I would beg to differ, and will leave that to each individual viewer.I did manage to see Crash in theaters (the film that beat Brokeback for the Oscar), and must admit, it was deserving of the award.  It was equally, if not more intense emotionally, on an far greater scale.

172412,A2RBHC9D8N7CVZ,1417030321,"cdset ""cdset""","[26, 30]","In addition to its keenly observed portrait of two men in love, who live in perpetual fear of discovery and reprisal, the multi-leveled ""Brokeback Mountain"" is a searing comment on a society that forces its non-mainstream inhabitants to conceal their identities from both outward prying eyes and, inevitably, from themselves. The tragic consequences of this loss of a sense of one's true self are what drives the ultimate sadness and unhappiness of the characters and leads them to their respective fates.It is an overwhelming passion and intense love that propels Ennis and Jack, the protagonists of the film, to defy societal convention and see each other in secret. ""This thing grabs hold of us...it has no reins,"" says Ennis. Although Ennis deeply senses that the uncontrollable urges he feels are a true and real form of love, he cannot reconcile what he feels with what he has been taught since childhood, and that has been grilled into him by an unkind, unforgiving world. Images of gay men being attacked and ridiculed constantly inhabit his thoughts. As the clandestine relationship progresses, Ennis becomes more bewildered and lost, so that by the end of the film he has accused Jack of being responsible for his feeling like ""nobody and nowhere"". He has lost any true sense of who he is, and helplessly straddles between the gay and straight worlds. He is unhappy and unfulfilled in both places. Although Jack remains closeted, he has a keener sense of himself, and has successfully erected a wall between himself and the negative opinions of others. He is willing to take risks in order to be happy, but his overpowering love for Ennis forces him to conceal his true self and seals, ultimately, his fate.At first I had conflicting feelings about the film. While overwhelmed and impressed by its incisive, understated screenplay, skillful, heartfelt performances, spectacular vistas, and precision like directing, I could not stem the feelings of anger rising up in me. Do we need another film where gay men are unhappy, unfulfilled and alone?  Do symbols like lovers' shirts or possessions have to substitute for the real thing?

MacNeil ""Chris M""","[19, 26]","""Brokeback Mountain"" has been reviewed and re-reviewed, critiqued and re-critiqued, analyzed and re-analyzed, lauded and re-lauded, and criticized and re-criticized till there is little original left to say. No matter: director Ang Lee's Oscar-winner based on E. Annie Proulx' story of unexpected but unfulfilled love between two men is a contemporary masterpiece powered by emotionally numbing performances from its two lead characters, Australian actor Heath Ledger and Jake Gyllenhaal, both in Oscar-nominated turns. So raw and honest do they carry the love (and its consequences) between their characters that both Ledger and Gyllenhaal may well have cemented themselves as A-caliber leading men in their industry. Ledger's character of Ennis is the antithesis of Gyllenhaal's of Jack, the first who literally fights against the love he begins to feel for the second. Beginning in 1963 Wyoming, the film embraces nearly 20 years in the lives of the two ranchers whose attraction and love for one another blossoms but, sadly (and tragically), is never fulfilled. Following the social script of the day, both men marry and have children but continue occasionally to hook up privately through the years. When they do, the emotional power of their passion and love - and its consequences to themselves and others - is numbing. No character better portrays the potential emotional devastation of learning that a spouse is having an extra-martial affair, much less an unconventional one, than Ledger's screen wife (Michelle Williams, also in an Oscar-nominated supporting role). Together, director Ang, Ledger and Gyllenhaal give us a disarming but honest and usually painful treatment of love that, for whatever reason, is forbidden and - sadly - can't always be fulfilled. To their credit, neither Proulx, author of the story that inspired the screenplay, nor Ang gives us a neat and happy resolution. To the contrary, the finale is emotionally wrenching. We are left with the fear that one man has died as a sacrifice to a hate crime while the other is left alone, by then middle-age, and has litle more than memories of a love not fully embraced. Ledger and Gyllenhaal command respect for the courage to embrace a film that, unfortunately, has been demeaned by so-called moralists as a vehicle to ""homosexualize"" the U.S. populace. In the end, ""Brokeback Mountain"" being categorized as a ""gay movie"" does the film an injustice: using a straight couple to carry the message that love, whoever it's between, isn't always accepted could have been as effective. No ""gay movie,"" this one: it is, in the final analysis, a simple love story, and its honesty, integrity and brillant acting command respect. By film's end, we are left with a sense and the painful reality that love isn't always the Great Healer. Hence, the film's subtle warning: treat love with care; in matters of the heart, it is far too precious a commodity - and a fragile one. Controversy and moral assesments aside, if for no other reason, Ledger's incredible performance warrants catching the film. He is simply that good and awesome, and he manages to stir the basic of the deepest of human emotion.",4,Love and emotion at their rawest,1145059200,"04 15, 2006",2006,3168,"['Brokeback', 'Mountain', 'been', 'reviewed', 're-reviewed', 'critiqued', 're-critiqued', 'analyzed', 're-analyzed', 'lauded', 're-lauded', 'criticized', 're-criticized', 'till', 'little', 'original', 'left', 'say', 'matter', 'director', 'Ang', 'Lee', 'Oscar-winner', 'based', 'E.', 'Annie', 'Proulx', 'story', 'unexpected', 'unfulfilled', 'love', 'two', 'men', 'contemporary', 'masterpiece', 'powered', 'emotionally', 'numbing', 'performances', 'two', 'lead', 'characters', 'Australian', 'actor', 'Heath', 'Ledger', 'Jake', 'Gyllenhaal', 'Oscar-nominated', 'turns', 'raw', 'honest', 'do', 'carry', 'love', 'consequences', 'characters', 'Ledger', 'Gyllenhaal', 'may', 'well', 'have', 'cemented', 'A-caliber', 'leading', 'men', 'industry', 'Ledger', 'character', 'Ennis', 'antithesis', 'Gyllenhaal', 'Jack', 'first', 'who', 'literally', 'fights', 'love', 'feel', 'second', 'Beginning', '1963', 'Wyoming', 'film', 'nearly', '20', 'years', 'lives', 'two', 'ranchers', 'attraction', 'love', 'one', 'blossoms', 'sadly', 'tragically', 'never', 'fulfilled', 'Following', 'social', 'script', 'day', 'men', 'marry', 'have', 'children', 'continue', 'occasionally', 'hook', 'up', 'privately', 'years', 'When', 'do', 'emotional', 'power', 'passion', 'love', 'consequences', 'others', 'numbing', 'character', 'better', 'potential', 'emotional', 'devastation', 'learning', 'spouse', 'having', 'extra-martial', 'affair', 'much', 'less', 'unconventional', 'one', 'Ledger', 'screen', 'wife', 'Michelle', 'Williams', 'also', 'Oscar-nominated', 'supporting', 'role', 'Together', 'director', 'Ang', 'Ledger', 'Gyllenhaal', 'give', 'disarming', 'honest', 'usually', 'painful', 'treatment', 'love', 'reason', 'forbidden', 'sadly', 'ca', ""n't"", 'always', 'be', 'fulfilled', 'credit', 'Proulx', 'author', 'story', 'inspired', 'screenplay', 'Ang', 'neat', 'happy', 'resolution', 'contrary', 'finale', 'emotionally', 'wrenching', 'are', 'left', 'fear', 'one', 'man', 'died', 'sacrifice', 'hate', 'crime', 'other', 'left', 'alone', 'then', 'middle-age', 'litle', 'more', 'memories', 'love', 'not', 'fully', 'embraced', 'Ledger', 'Gyllenhaal', 'command', 'respect', 'courage', 'embrace', 'film', 'unfortunately', 'been', 'demeaned', 'so-called', 'moralists', 'vehicle', 'homosexualize', 'U.S.', 'populace', 'end', 'Brokeback', 'Mountain', 'being', 'categorized', 'gay', 'movie', 'film', 'injustice', 'using', 'straight', 'couple', 'carry', 'message', 'love', 'whoever', ""n't"", 'always', 'accepted', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'effective', 'gay', 'movie', 'one', 'final', 'analysis', 'simple', 'love', 'story', 'honesty', 'integrity', 'brillant', 'acting', 'command', 'respect', 'film', 'end', 'are', 'left', 'sense', 'painful', 'reality', 'love', ""n't"", 'always', 'Great', 'Healer', 'Hence', 'film', 'subtle', 'warning', 'treat', 'love', 'care', 'matters', 'heart', 'far', 'too', 'precious', 'commodity', 'fragile', 'one', 'Controversy', 'moral', 'assesments', 'aside', 'other', 'reason', 'Ledger', 'incredible', 'performance', 'warrants', 'catching', 'film', 'simply', 'good', 'awesome', 'stir', 'basic', 'deepest', 'human', 'emotion']",N/A

172424,A2YNTGYG5J5U3J,1417030321,"ck123 ""ck123""","[12, 18]","Overall, I think this movie was great. Ennis and Jack discover their affection for one another as they work together during the summer as sheep herders back in 1963. After they had their sexual encounter, Jack is not afraid to share his feelings. And  deep down inside, Ennis has feelings for Jack, but he rejects the idea of having a life together with Jack. He rejects the idea because he is reminded of a hate crime that occured when Ennis was a child, where a man was killed because he lived with another man. Ennis knew that society would not be ready to accept him and Jack living together either. When I saw the ending of the movie, I thought it felt awkward and left me feeling empty. And as I read in another reviewer's comments on another site, the ending is supposed to leave you feeling empty. But I think the ending fits in with Ennis's character as he still tried to be involved with his children to some extent, which happens throughout the whole movie. And I didn't think of this until today, but it's ironic at the end of the movie how Ennis's daughter announces she is going to get married, and she's all happy about it. Yet, Ennis is all alone and does not have his true love with him.I also wanted to comment on a couple other reviews I had seen on this site.One person had commented that Ennis and Jack never seemed to age over this 20 year story. On the contrary, I felt that the make up artists did a good job at making them look older, particularly with Jack having the moustache and a little bit of grey hair.Another reviewer had commented that they felt this love story was not as romantic or as endearing as they thought it would be. And perhaps it is not as romantic or endearing as you might think with having seen the previews. Although I do feel there were a couple scenes where they kissed and cuddled, which I thought was somewhat romantic. And I thought it was touching when Ennis cried after their summer of sheep herding came to an end. And it was even more touching as Ennis hugged Jack's coat towards the end of the movie. However, I think these reviewers who were expecting a highly romantic movie need to step back and think a little. This movie is NOT a ""Romeo and Juliet"" movie where everything is all romantic, poetic, and flowery. It's a movie about 2 cowboys who discover they have feelings for each other while working together as sheep herders back in 1963. Being a gay man myself, I know that when you first discover you have feelings for another person of the same sex, this can be confusing. And it certainly must be a confusing thing for 2 cowboys to have feelings for each other and not understand them. Plus the fact that this story takes place in 1963, when homosexuality is not widely discussed, and certainly not accepted by society.

He facetiously blamed homosexual panic -- adding, by way of explanation, that as ""a very susceptible person, easily influenced ... if two cowboys, male icons who are 100 percent all-man, can succumb, what chance do I have, half- to a quarter of a man?""He shouldn't worry, and neither should anyone else. Ang Lee's sweeping, picturesque drama might increase tourism in Wyoming, but the problem faced by the main characters doesn't seem at all an enviable predicament.They are Ennis Del Mar and Jack Twist (Heath Ledger and Jake Gyllenhaal), two young cowhands who herd sheep together during the summer of 1963 and find themselves growing close in a way they vaguely understand but can't completely accept.The two enter into a sudden affair that is frankly sketched but not particularly graphic or prolonged, and as its story unfolds, ""Brokeback"" really becomes more about the time the men are apart than the time they're together. They go their separate ways and try to start families, but are shadowed for years by their guilt, secrets, lies and love.The movie is based on a short story by E. Annie Proulx but it was adapted by Larry McMurtry and Diana Ossana and, with its windswept small towns and its confused tough guys, it certainly feels of a piece with such classic McMurtry adaptations as ""Hud"" and ""The Last Picture Show.""Ledger, an Australian actor, seamlessly fits into the role of Ennis and gives one of the year's best performances. Early on, he seems to begin each sentence with the anxiety of a man stepping onto a high ledge, and when he does speak he mumbles through a mouth distorted by a chaw of tobacco. By the end, though, he's quietly become a surprisingly deep and tragic figure.Gyllenhaal, as the more expressive of the pair, has the flashier part but is effective as well; and Michelle Williams, in a supporting role as Ennis' long-suffering wife, reveals a heartbreak that's no less real than that of the main characters.Buzz has been surrounding ""Brokeback"" since before it was released, and the praise is well deserved, but viewers might want to dial down the expectations fueled by the movie's uniformly rave reviews. Yes, this is one of the year's best, and it mines genuine sadness from situations that might've easily turned unintentionally funny -- let's face it, there's comic potential in the idea of gay cowboys, and Leno and Letterman have probably hit it all.But this is also a movie that hits its true highs with small, precise, understated ingredients such as the sight of a new number on a mailbox, or a forgotten childhood toy, or a scribbled message on a postcard, or an old shirt hanging in a closet.",4,A big movie built mostly on small moments,1137801600,"01 21, 2006",2006,2771,"['have', ""n't"", 'seen', ""'Brokeback"", 'Mountain', 'do', 'have', 'intention', 'seeing', 'joked', 'Larry', 'David', 'recent', 'New', 'York', 'Times', 'facetiously', 'blamed', 'homosexual', 'panic', 'adding', 'way', 'explanation', 'very', 'susceptible', 'person', 'easily', 'influenced', 'two', 'cowboys', 'male', 'icons', 'who', 'are', '100', 'percent', 'all-man', 'can', 'succumb', 'what', 'chance', 'do', 'have', 'half-', 'quarter', 'man', 'should', ""n't"", 'worry', 'should', 'anyone', 'else', 'Ang', 'Lee', 'sweeping', 'picturesque', 'drama', 'might', 'increase', 'tourism', 'Wyoming', 'problem', 'faced', 'main', 'characters', ""n't"", 'seem', 'enviable', 'predicament.They', 'are', 'Ennis', 'Del', 'Mar', 'Jack', 'Twist', 'Heath', 'Ledger', 'Jake', 'Gyllenhaal', 'two', 'young', 'cowhands', 'who', 'herd', 'sheep', 'together', 'summer', '1963', 'find', 'growing', 'close', 'way', 'vaguely', 'understand', 'ca', ""n't"", 'completely', 'accept.The', 'two', 'enter', 'sudden', 'affair', 'frankly', 'sketched', 'not', 'particularly', 'graphic', 'prolonged', 'story', 'unfolds', 'Brokeback', 'really', 'more', 'time', 'men', 'are', 'apart', 'time', ""'re"", 'together', 'go', 'separate', 'ways', 'try', 'start', 'families', 'are', 'shadowed', 'years', 'guilt', 'secrets', 'lies', 'love.The', 'movie', 'based', 'short', 'story', 'E.', 'Annie', 'Proulx', 'was', 'adapted', 'Larry', 'McMurtry', 'Diana', 'Ossana', 'windswept', 'small', 'towns', 'confused', 'tough', 'guys', 'certainly', 'piece', 'such', 'classic', 'McMurtry', 'adaptations', 'Hud', 'Last', 'Picture', 'Show', 'Ledger', 'Australian', 'actor', 'seamlessly', 'role', 'Ennis', 'one', 'year', 'best', 'performances', 'Early', 'begin', 'sentence', 'anxiety', 'man', 'stepping', 'high', 'ledge', 'when', 'speak', 'mouth', 'distorted', 'chaw', 'tobacco', 'end', 'though', 'quietly', 'become', 'surprisingly', 'deep', 'tragic', 'figure.Gyllenhaal', 'more', 'expressive', 'pair', 'flashier', 'part', 'effective', 'well', 'Michelle', 'Williams', 'supporting', 'role', 'Ennis', 'long-suffering', 'wife', 'heartbreak', 'less', 'real', 'main', 'characters.Buzz', 'been', 'surrounding', 'Brokeback', 'was', 'released', 'praise', 'well', 'deserved', 'viewers', 'might', 'want', 'dial', 'down', 'expectations', 'fueled', 'movie', 'uniformly', 'rave', 'reviews', 'Yes', 'one', 'year', 'best', 'genuine', 'sadness', 'situations', 'might', ""'ve"", 'easily', 'turned', 'unintentionally', 'funny', 'let', 'face', 'comic', 'potential', 'idea', 'gay', 'cowboys', 'Leno', 'Letterman', 'have', 'probably', 'hit', 'also', 'movie', 'true', 'highs', 'small', 'precise', 'understated', 'ingredients', 'such', 'sight', 'new', 'number', 'mailbox', 'forgotten', 'childhood', 'toy', 'scribbled', 'message', 'postcard', 'old', 'shirt', 'hanging', 'closet']",N/A
172426,A1AISPOIIHTHXX,1417030321,"Cloud ""...""","[9, 19]","This movie got a large amount of controversy, all of it going to its theme: homosexuality. While it certainly feels like a breakthrough film, there have been films with the very same theme before. Most of them, however, are barely seen as they're usually arty independent movies or foreign ones. Brokeback in many ways shows that it's still a problem with people and while it may have some storytelling issues I have a problem with, it's still a solid story, it's only missing something that makes it an absolute masterpiece.In probably one of the most slowest opening 40 minutes I've ever seen, we follow Jack Twist and Ennis Del Mar as they become sheep herders. Alone for a long time, the 2 act on feelings that they might love each other. Of course the problem is they're both men which is very frowned upon at the time. The 2 go home and end up leading separate lives but are very much wondering about the love that could've lasted.Flash forward 4 years and Ennis marries Alma who gave birth to 2 daughters while Jack meets Lureen and they have a son. A meeting between the 2 men rekindles their relationship and now have a decision to make: to continue in short and increasing gaps of time or call it off forever, not experiencing each other's love anymore. This of course doesn't sit well with either of them, or their wives.There will be people who probably won't like this review(or any other like it) where I don't outright praise the film for the masterpiece that it is and that I either don't ""get it"" or I'm a homophobe. I'm not gay but I don't go after them either, it's love period regardless of who's in it(although I do have problems with animal lovers and pedophiles). The film has been called groundbreaking but really it's just a love story, only with 2 men. What about movies where the underdog team actually lost instead of triumphing in a big finish? Or a crime story that has the killer actually win? Storytelling wise these could be called groundbreakers too and they've been done before as well.Acting-wise it's straight across the board with Michelle Williams and Anne Hathaway proving that they can be actresses(the latter's turn in Havoc was just wasted). Jake Gyllenhaal is good as well but the biggest attention went to Heath Ledger. Granted it's a very good performance full of nuance but at the same time, he almost mumbles through the entire thing. I'm glad I put subtitles on sometimes, otherwise I wouldn't know what he was saying half the time.It's odd how the filmmakers want us to root for the love of 2 gay men despite the fact both are committing adultery, one of which is actually with 2 others, including his wife. The other actually ends up getting divorced because of it and to see the 2 men get together only to hide away their feelings and be quiet about it you kind of wonder, ""they seem happier with their women don't they?"" It's slightly manipulative as well since the cinematography during their passionate love trips are beautifully shot with mountain ranges while their normal homes have drabby looking houses, crying kids and depressed looking wives. It's no wonder we want to root for the men don't we?I will give the film props though: it is a love story and it's handled nicely if one sided and the actors are more than willing to show it. It might seem like I'm using more from the con list but it does have great cinematography, a relaxing(if extremely repetitive) score which I have no idea why it won the Oscar. The story between the women could've been handled better though. Michelle Williams literally drops out at one point in the story and the direction on Anne Hathaway during her last scene makes the ambigious ending even moreso.Expect a double dip, this one is guaranteed. Obviously wanting to capitalize on the Oscar attention, the film comes with a very barebones disc, coming up with no more than 4 featurettes. No commentary? Deleted scenes? Coincidentally, Crash which got the upset Best Picture win over this film is released on the same day with a bigger release. Trying to steal thunder, methinks? It's a solid story and while it is a good film, I can see why it lost, although personally, Crash is no better.",4,A great love story or overhyped liberalism?,1144281600,"04 6, 2006",2006,4187,"['movie', 'got', 'large', 'amount', 'controversy', 'going', 'theme', 'homosexuality', 'certainly', 'breakthrough', 'film', 'have', 'been', 'films', 'very', 'same', 'theme', 'Most', 'however', 'are', 'barely', 'seen', ""'re"", 'usually', 'arty', 'independent', 'movies', 'foreign', 'ones', 'Brokeback', 'many', 'ways', 'still', 'problem', 'people', 'may', 'have', 'storytelling', 'issues', 'have', 'problem', 'still', 'solid', 'story', 'only', 'missing', 'something', 'absolute', 'masterpiece.In', 'probably', 'one', 'most', 'slowest', 'opening', '40', 'minutes', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'seen', 'follow', 'Jack', 'Twist', 'Ennis', 'Del', 'Mar', 'become', 'sheep', 'herders', 'Alone', 'long', 'time', '2', 'act', 'feelings', 'might', 'love', 'other', 'course', 'problem', ""'re"", 'men', 'very', 'frowned', 'upon', 'time', '2', 'go', 'home', 'end', 'up', 'leading', 'separate', 'lives', 'are', 'very', 'much', 'wondering', 'love', 'could', ""'ve"", 'lasted.Flash', 'forward', '4', 'years', 'Ennis', 'marries', 'Alma', 'who', 'gave', 'birth', '2', 'daughters', 'Jack', 'meets', 'Lureen', 'have', 'son', 'meeting', '2', 'men', 'rekindles', 'relationship', 'now', 'have', 'decision', 'make', 'continue', 'short', 'increasing', 'gaps', 'time', 'call', 'off', 'forever', 'not', 'experiencing', 'other', 'love', 'anymore', 'course', ""n't"", 'sit', 'well', 'wives.There', 'will', 'be', 'people', 'who', 'probably', 'wo', ""n't"", 'like', 'review', 'other', 'where', 'do', ""n't"", 'outright', 'praise', 'film', 'masterpiece', 'do', ""n't"", 'get', ""'m"", 'homophobe', ""'m"", 'not', 'gay', 'do', ""n't"", 'go', 'either', 'love', 'period', 'regardless', 'who', 'do', 'have', 'problems', 'animal', 'lovers', 'pedophiles', 'film', 'been', 'called', 'groundbreaking', 'really', 'just', 'love', 'story', 'only', '2', 'men', 'What', 'movies', 'where', 'underdog', 'team', 'actually', 'lost', 'instead', 'triumphing', 'big', 'finish', 'crime', 'story', 'killer', 'actually', 'win', 'Storytelling', 'wise', 'could', 'be', 'called', 'groundbreakers', 'too', ""'ve"", 'been', 'done', 'well.Acting-wise', 'straight', 'board', 'Michelle', 'Williams', 'Anne', 'Hathaway', 'proving', 'can', 'be', 'actresses', 'latter', 'turn', 'Havoc', 'was', 'just', 'wasted', 'Jake', 'Gyllenhaal', 'good', 'as', 'well', 'biggest', 'attention', 'went', 'Heath', 'Ledger', 'Granted', 'very', 'good', 'performance', 'full', 'nuance', 'same', 'time', 'almost', 'entire', 'thing', ""'m"", 'glad', 'put', 'subtitles', 'sometimes', 'otherwise', 'would', ""n't"", 'know', 'what', 'was', 'saying', 'time.It', 'odd', 'how', 'filmmakers', 'want', 'root', 'love', '2', 'gay', 'men', 'fact', 'are', 'committing', 'adultery', 'one', 'actually', '2', 'others', 'including', 'wife', 'other', 'actually', 'up', 'getting', 'divorced', 'see', '2', 'men', 'get', 'together', 'only', 'hide', 'away', 'feelings', 'be', 'quiet', 'kind', 'wonder', 'seem', 'happier', 'women', 'do', ""n't"", 'slightly', 'manipulative', 'well', 'cinematography', 'passionate', 'trips', 'are', 'beautifully', 'shot', 'mountain', 'ranges', 'normal', 'homes', 'have', 'drabby', 'looking', 'houses', 'crying', 'kids', 'depressed', 'looking', 'wives', 'wonder', 'want', 'root', 'men', 'do', ""n't"", 'will', 'give', 'film', 'love', 'story', 'handled', 'nicely', 'one', 'sided', 'actors', 'are', 'more', 'willing', 'show', 'might', 'seem', ""'m"", 'using', 'more', 'con', 'list', 'have', 'great', 'cinematography', 'relaxing', 'extremely', 'repetitive', 'score', 'have', 'idea', 'why', 'won', 'Oscar', 'story', 'women', 'could', ""'ve"", 'been', 'handled', 'better', 'Michelle', 'Williams', 'literally', 'out', 'one', 'point', 'story', 'direction', 'Anne', 'Hathaway', 'last', 'scene', 'ambigious', 'ending', 'even', 'moreso.Expect', 'double', 'dip', 'one', 'guaranteed', 'Obviously', 'wanting', 'capitalize', 'Oscar', 'attention', 'film', 'very', 'barebones', 'disc', 'coming', 'up', 'more', '4', 'featurettes', 'commentary', 'Deleted', 'scenes', 'Coincidentally', 'Crash', 'got', 'upset', 'Best', 'Picture', 'win', 'film', 'released', 'same', 'day', 'bigger', 'release', 'Trying', 'steal', 'thunder', 'methinks', 'solid', 'story', 'good', 'film', 'can', 'see', 'why', 'lost', 'personally', 'Crash', 'better']",N/A

I did not go into this film, having now seen it first on DVD thinking it was a movie about gay sexual relationships by two cowboys. I viewed it looking for passion in character and culture in the cowboy lifestyle. I found neither. Heath Ledger looked disinterested...lack of dialogue, lack of fire and lack of character development. The focus of his love, Jake Gyllenhaal just did not fulfill the cowboy look to me. He was too city strung and at times even reminded me of Billy Crystal in ""City Slickers."" There was not enough movement in the storyline for me to feel sorry for either one of them and as I said, I don't view movies with a bias going in.The tragedy in the end with Jack's slaying seemed like the senseless and silly ending that Nicholas Evans gave Robert Redford's movie character Tom Booker in his book version of ""The Horse Whisperer."" In the book, the horse Pilgrim rears up and crashes down on Booker, killing him instantly simply because the horse hated him. Redford left that silly notion out of the movie and instead made a real love story that captured the life of a western rancher falling in love with a married city executive. Brokeback killed off Jack in a stereotypical fashion symbolic of the killing of the gay student in Wyoming several years ago...because of the prejudice part of our society has towards gays. Too easy an ending to create sympathy and a convenient ending of sadness. The link of course was to Jack's flashback of the man earlier in his life who was killed in much the same way. I would have been more satisfied had Jack and Ennis just realized they could not meet anymore because of the dangers of such love at the time.To the myriad of reviewers who have applauded the film, I respect your admiration.

Slipman,"[13, 26]","Ang Lee's slightly overhyped ""Brokeback Mountain"" was a decent story about a relationship forged between two Wyoming cowboys played by Heath Ledger and Jake Gyllenhaal who were to become lifelong soulmates.  The film benefited from Hollywoods perchant for heralding particular themes when selecting films for awards.  This years theme of alternative lifestyles elevated the film's status.  No question the film was cinematographically stunning with its gorgeous western panoramic vistas and desolate Wyoming towns.  The relationship between the men was poignant yet the film dragged at points.Their tabooed relationship was in stark contrast to the social mores present in the 60's and 70's in the remote West.  Ledger in particular was very effective as the taciturn Ennis Del Mar who finds love with Gyllenhaal playing Jack Twist as they work a summertime job of sheepherding on Brokeback Mountain.  Both men go on to marry and have children existing in largely unfulfilling relationships.  After a hiatus of four years they reconnect are able to find chunks of time where they go off together.The stories chronicles the evolution of their relationship over an approximately 15-20 year period of time that culminates unfortunately in tragedy.Ang Lee did a nice job in his direction and hefty Randy Quaid did well in his portrayal of the sheepherding boss Joe Aguirre.",4,An unconventional love story,1143849600,"04 1, 2006",2006,1369,"['Ang', 'Lee', 'slightly', 'overhyped', 'Brokeback', 'Mountain', 'was', 'decent', 'story', 'relationship', 'forged', 'two', 'Wyoming', 'cowboys', 'played', 'Heath', 'Ledger', 'Jake', 'Gyllenhaal', 'who', 'were', 'become', 'lifelong', 'soulmates', 'film', 'benefited', 'Hollywoods', 'perchant', 'heralding', 'particular', 'themes', 'when', 'selecting', 'films', 'awards', 'years', 'theme', 'alternative', 'lifestyles', 'elevated', 'film', 'status', 'question', 'film', 'was', 'cinematographically', 'stunning', 'gorgeous', 'western', 'panoramic', 'vistas', 'desolate', 'Wyoming', 'towns', 'relationship', 'men', 'was', 'poignant', 'yet', 'film', 'dragged', 'points.Their', 'tabooed', 'relationship', 'was', 'stark', 'contrast', 'social', 'mores', 'present', '60', '70', 'remote', 'West', 'Ledger', 'particular', 'was', 'very', 'effective', 'taciturn', 'Ennis', 'Del', 'Mar', 'who', 'love', 'Gyllenhaal', 'playing', 'Jack', 'Twist', 'work', 'summertime', 'job', 'sheepherding', 'Brokeback', 'Mountain', 'men', 'go', 'marry', 'have', 'children', 'existing', 'largely', 'unfulfilling', 'relationships', 'hiatus', 'four', 'years', 'reconnect', 'are', 'able', 'find', 'chunks', 'time', 'where', 'go', 'off', 'together.The', 'stories', 'evolution', 'relationship', 'approximately', '15-20', 'year', 'period', 'time', 'unfortunately', 'tragedy.Ang', 'Lee', 'did', 'nice', 'job', 'direction', 'hefty', 'Randy', 'Quaid', 'did', 'well', 'portrayal', 'sheepherding', 'boss', 'Joe', 'Aguirre']",N/A

I have seen it 12 times and the last night it played I saw it back to back I wish it would stay on the big screen forever because the DVD on TV will not give the wide scope the background that helps in creating the whole story. My message to people who are turned off by two men in love is to ignore the sex of the characters and Listen To The Story. The STORY can affect everyone differently and I wish they would see it for the story line. I lost control one night after seeing it. When I got home I fell apart and could not even stand up. It can be a very emotional film and is a very emotional film. Especially those who grew up in that era. I was 2 years younger than Ennis and Jack so it hits home. ['] There are no words to express how I love this masterpiece of film. ['] I still get very emotional over the movie and the soundtrack. That too was a wonderful piece of work and I don't think there could be anything musically adds to enhance the film. Thank you to all who worked so hard to make this wonderful film. To me it's up there with ""Gone With the Wind"" and ""Titanic"" as some of our greatest movies made.AUGUST 5, 2006I WENT TO SEE THIS MAJESTIC MOVIE 12 TIMES AND I CRIED EVERY TIME.

HEATH DID SUCH A GREAT JOB BY THE TIME THE MOVIE WAS ABOUT HALF WAY OR LESS HE WAS ENNIS EDL MAR. THERE WS NO HEATH LEFT. HE TOOK ALL OF HIS ENERGY AND DUG DOWN INTO HIS SOUL AND ACTUALLY CREATED ENNIS DEL MAR. THE BECAME THE REAL PERSON, JUST BY THAT PART OF ACTING HE DESERVED THE OSCAR, THIS MOVIE IS TOO MUCH FOR ME TO WATCH. SINCE IT LEFT THE THEATER I HAVE WATCHED IT TWICE AND TOTALLY BROKE DOWN AND CRIED, IT'S TO POWERFUL AND EMOTIONAL. I LOVE IT!AUGUST 6,2006I LOVE AND ADORE THIS MOVIE AND IT SHOULD HAVE WON ALL THE OSCARS IT WAS NOMINATED FOR, AND IN MY HEART IT HAS. HEATH DID AN EXCELLENT JOB IN CREATING ENNIS DEL MAR. HE HAD TO CREATE THIS CHARACTER FROM A SHORT STORY AND FLESH IT OUT TO A 2+HOUR MOVIE. HE HAD TO CREATE A FICTIONAL CHARACTER AND REACHED DEEP DOWN INTO HIS INNER SELF AND PULL THIS CHARACTER TO THE SURFACE. I LOVE THIS MOVIE AN IT WILL ALWAYS BE MY FAVORITE. I HOPE SOME DAY I'LL BE ABLE TO WATCH IT AGAIN, WITH OUT HAVING AN EMOTIONAL BREAKDOWN. I CRIED EVERY TIME AT THE THEATER AND THE 2 TIMES AT HOME. I HAVE NOT WATCHED IT SINCE THEN. IT IS TO EMOTIONAL FOR ME TO HANDLE, IT HITS TOO CLOSE TO HOME FOR ME.I WAS ENNIS DEL MAR, FOR 15 YEARS WAS MARRIED,THEN DIVORCED BUT I FOUND MY TRUE LOVE, IN A DIFFERENT LOCATION BUT AT THE SAME TIME PERIOD.I FELT THE SAME WAY HE DID AND HAD THE SAME NEEDS HE DID.

Much was made about it being the first mainstream movie about gay cowboys but it was also an achievement for Lee that he was able to bounce back from the commercial and critical disappointment that was Hulk.Heath Ledger has gone from teen comedies like 10 Things I Hate About You to such diverse roles as the ones in Lords of Dogtown and The Brothers Grimm. This performance may be his finest yet. It is a very internalized one. Ennis doesn't communicate very much verbally but rather through physical gestures and by his eyes. It also doesn't hurt that Ledger has the rugged good looks that are ideal for this role.Jake Gyllenhaal turns in yet another excellent performance as a hopeless romantic stuck in a marriage with someone he doesn't truly love. One gets the feeling that the time away from Ennis affects him the most but it is only because it is visible in the way he acts and in his eyes. He's the one who pushes hardest from the two of them to discard their traditional lives and be together all the time. However, as the film progresses, we begin to realize that their time apart hurts Ennis just as much - he just keeps it bottled up inside.There is a touching intimacy to Jack and Ennis' relationship. It isn't just physical, it is also about companionship. When you spend that amount of time with someone you get to know them really well. It is the kind of relationship that changes the course of their lives. Ultimately, Brokeback Mountain is a tragic love story - even more so because we get to know Jack and Ennis so well. We become emotionally invested in their lives and we know that they can never be together in the way that they would like. Ang Lee's film is one of those rare ones that actually does live up to its hype and definitely worth a look.""On Being a Cowboy"" takes a look at the cowboy camp that the actors went through so that they could get an idea of what that kind of life was like and portray it convincingly on camera.

172439,A28WJUJF6D2ULA,1417030321,Dai-keag-ity,"[39, 122]","I liked exactly two things about this, the single most over-rated motion picture to come down the pike since....I can't remember when. The first thing I liked was the beauty of the natural setting at the start of the movie when the couple at the heart of this story, Jack and Ennis, were atop Brokeback Mountain itself. The other was during the fireworks scene when Heath Ledger's character punched out the rude biker type who was cussing and being crude around his little girls. The rest of the film...well...I realize this is one of those stories where if you don't like it, you're instantly and with a closed-mind convicted of being a homophobe (such a convenient passive-aggressive term!) or unenlightened, or the ever-pat, ""you just didn't get it.""  I disagree. I'd like to think I'm at least as enlightened as the next person out there and if I'm accused to failing to ""get"" Brokeback Mountain, then I'll turn the tables and say maybe a large portion of the audience was too ready to excuse too much here and proclaim its greatness for reasons other than its onscreen merits. Namely: ""Hey, look at how cool I am, embracing this movie about homosexuality!""I suspect many hailed Brokeback Mountain as masterpiece because they felt its subject matter was somehow artsy, ground-breaking, and morally sophisticated. I'll leave those evaluations to others. All I know is I saw it from a neutral perspective and I did not like this film. I expected I'd at least come away seeing some sort of quality to it, but even that is largely lacking. Michelle Williams, who gave seven seasons worth of fine performances on Dawson's Creek was such a washed-out weakling here, it was almost unrecognizable that she possesses the acting talents she does. I realize both the lead actors are in reality heterosexual men, but even so, for supposedly portraying two souls deeply in love, I discerned no chemistry at all between them, only a coldness that made it clear they were just two actors playing parts: disbelief was not suspended, reality intruded into the plot. If anything, a good subtitle for these guys might've been ""dumb and dumber"". Kissing like they did in public, in plain sight of one of their wives, in town, and their boss up on Brokeback Mountain? And yet thinking they were keeping some sort of secret for twenty-whatever years? Am I alone in seeing that as...stupid?What really put me off was not the relationship between the men, adulterous though it was, it was the fact these supposedly sympathetic figures were complete and total jerks. Obviously they were miserable and wished to impose that misery on anyone close to them. They were terrible fathers, especially Ennis, who constantly and cruelly let his longsuffering daughter down, rotten (and unfaithful) husbands, and not even very good friends and lovers to one another. How anyone felt anything but alienation radiating from these two defies explanation. If this is the movie that was meant to be a groundbreaking ambassador for the gay community, I think gays are in trouble, because far from advancing the cause of that segment, surely this is a closet-embracing backset.",2,"The Emperor Ain't Wearing Clothes, Folks",1157500800,"09 6, 2006",2006,3139,"['liked', 'exactly', 'two', 'things', 'single', 'most', 'over-rated', 'motion', 'picture', 'come', 'down', 'pike', '.I', 'ca', ""n't"", 'remember', 'when', 'first', 'thing', 'liked', 'was', 'beauty', 'natural', 'setting', 'start', 'movie', 'when', 'couple', 'heart', 'story', 'Jack', 'Ennis', 'were', 'atop', 'Brokeback', 'Mountain', 'other', 'was', 'fireworks', 'scene', 'when', 'Heath', 'Ledger', 'character', 'punched', 'out', 'rude', 'biker', 'type', 'who', 'was', 'cussing', 'being', 'crude', 'little', 'girls', 'rest', 'film', 'well', 'realize', 'one', 'stories', 'where', 'do', ""n't"", 'like', ""'re"", 'instantly', 'closed-mind', 'convicted', 'being', 'homophobe', 'such', 'convenient', 'passive-aggressive', 'term', 'unenlightened', 'ever-pat', 'just', 'did', ""n't"", 'get', 'disagree', ""'d"", 'like', 'think', ""'m"", 'least', 'as', 'enlightened', 'next', 'person', 'there', ""'m"", 'accused', 'failing', 'get', 'Brokeback', 'Mountain', 'then', ""'ll"", 'turn', 'tables', 'say', 'maybe', 'large', 'portion', 'audience', 'was', 'too', 'ready', 'excuse', 'too', 'much', 'here', 'proclaim', 'greatness', 'reasons', 'other', 'onscreen', 'merits', 'Namely', 'Hey', 'look', 'how', 'cool', 'am', 'embracing', 'movie', 'homosexuality', 'suspect', 'many', 'hailed', 'Brokeback', 'Mountain', 'masterpiece', 'felt', 'subject', 'matter', 'was', 'somehow', 'artsy', 'ground-breaking', 'morally', 'sophisticated', ""'ll"", 'leave', 'evaluations', 'others', 'know', 'saw', 'neutral', 'perspective', 'did', 'not', 'film', 'expected', ""'d"", 'least', 'come', 'away', 'seeing', 'sort', 'quality', 'even', 'largely', 'lacking', 'Michelle', 'Williams', 'who', 'gave', 'seven', 'seasons', 'fine', 'performances', 'Dawson', 'Creek', 'was', 'such', 'washed-out', 'weakling', 'here', 'was', 'almost', 'unrecognizable', 'acting', 'talents', 'realize', 'lead', 'actors', 'are', 'reality', 'heterosexual', 'men', 'even', 'so', 'supposedly', 'portraying', 'two', 'souls', 'deeply', 'love', 'discerned', 'chemistry', 'only', 'coldness', 'made', 'clear', 'were', 'just', 'two', 'actors', 'playing', 'parts', 'disbelief', 'was', 'not', 'suspended', 'reality', 'intruded', 'plot', 'anything', 'good', 'subtitle', 'guys', 'might', ""'ve"", 'been', 'dumb', 'dumber', 'Kissing', 'did', 'public', 'plain', 'sight', 'one', 'wives', 'town', 'boss', 'up', 'Brokeback', 'Mountain', 'yet', 'thinking', 'were', 'keeping', 'sort', 'secret', 'twenty-whatever', 'years', 'Am', 'alone', 'seeing', 'stupid', 'What', 'really', 'put', 'off', 'was', 'not', 'relationship', 'men', 'adulterous', 'was', 'was', 'fact', 'supposedly', 'sympathetic', 'figures', 'were', 'complete', 'total', 'jerks', 'Obviously', 'were', 'miserable', 'wished', 'impose', 'misery', 'anyone', 'close', 'were', 'terrible', 'fathers', 'especially', 'Ennis', 'who', 'constantly', 'cruelly', 'let', 'longsuffering', 'daughter', 'down', 'rotten', 'unfaithful', 'husbands', 'not', 'even', 'very', 'good', 'friends', 'lovers', 'one', 'How', 'anyone', 'felt', 'anything', 'alienation', 'radiating', 'two', 'defies', 'explanation', 'movie', 'was', 'meant', 'be', 'groundbreaking', 'ambassador', 'gay', 'community', 'think', 'gays', 'are', 'trouble', 'far', 'advancing', 'cause', 'segment', 'surely', 'closet-embracing', 'backset']",N/A

172441,A3Q1FVRV0CRYTH,1417030321,"Damian Gunn ""The Dark One is I""","[16, 25]","This film stands tall as one of the best love stories ever written, filmed and acted in a long time.  The acting on all fronts is spot on and thats important in a film of this magnitude.  From Ennis and Jacks lovetorn relationship to Alma and her broken spirit upon realizing her husbands ways you are drug down into their lives, into their hearts and then shattered upon impact.  When watching this film you can't help but see yourself, see who you are on the inside.  No, this may not mean you see yourself as a homosexual man living a lie, but you can see the true intentions of the heart, you can see your life through eyes yet unseen.  I guess the best way to put it is this.  As has been said by many a critic, this film is a universal love story.  Yes I agree that it is mainly about the gay community and their stiving towards acceptance, but it really is so much more than that.  This film is not about a man loving a man or a man loving a woman but more a film about a man loving...plain and simple.  It's not about who he loves or how he loves but it's about him being able to really love someone.  Jack and Ennis found what one can rarely find these days, a love that transends time and rules and boundrys and even death.  These two men really were in love.  The brilliance here is in the depth of each charactor.  Ennis (played brilliantly by Heath Ledger) is reserved and cautious, afraid of his feelings, afraid of his heart because his heart is not something accepted by the world he lives in.  Jack (Gyllenhall) is the opposite, ready and willing to give himself, devote himself to Ennis at all costs.  To me, the star of this film is Jake Gyllenhall who gave a powerhouse performance and really proved to be the emotional core of the film.  He was a man lost in the times, lost in the way things were even though he just wanted to be loved by the one person he truly loved.  Is that a crime?  I can appreciate this film and appreciate the story it relates because I think every one of us has felt one way, anyway, that wasn't accepted by others, that was looked down on by others and yet maybe we weren't strong enough to keep pushing through.  Maybe we buckled under and gave into what other expected of us.  This is a beautiful story of two men who needed to be loved and needed to be accepted.  They found love and they found acceptance but it came with a price...but as the film, to me at least, shows so well is that that price is worth it's weight in gold if it means being happy.  These men never got to enjoy that bennifit because they never took hold of what they had.  They allowed society and what society thought to break apart what they could have had.  Ennis, more so than Jack, allowed his own fear to clowd out his heart and that drove him away from Jack, not because he didn't love him (just watch his heartwrenching scene after he walks away from Jack...as he crouches down in the ally)...no, he loved Jack but he was afraid of what man would do to him, what society would do to him, and I feel that he loved his wife, he loved her and didn't want to hurt her.  He knew being with her was the politically correct thing to do even though the lie of a life he was leading was killing them both.  Let that be a lesson to all of us.  If we know how to be happy, screw what anyone else thinks or says...do that thing that completes you...be happy because a life lived alone inside is the worst life to live.*I do want to point out that the exclution of Anne Hathaway in every award cerimony is a bit harsh.  She turned out a steller performance that I feel was overlooked because of all the attention Miss Williams is receiving...Anne would have been a welcome replacement for McDormand or Kenear at this years Oscars.

The one cowboy asks the bartender, ""say, do you serve sheep in this bar?"" And the bartender says: ""Naaahhh, pardner, but we do make some mean Buffalo Wings!""Ba-dump-bump.Anyway, Ang Lee bellies up to a different kind of bar with ""Brokeback Mountain"", a tale of the Love that Dare Not Speak its Name in 1963 Wyoming, where the men were---umm, well, fairly manly---and the sheep were pretty damned nervous.It's all about Jack and Ennis, two sheep-herds who venture out on the Lone Prair-EE and end up driving a lot more than a herd of sheep across the plains.""Brokeback"" is just not all that: this movie is Lonnnnng. Dear Jesus, they don't even tell you it's nearly eight hours without a potty break, and yeah, it packs its tale of anguish, terror, and white-hot bull-riding over the course of 30 years or so, but in the end you'll feel like you've been hanging with these two Tumbling Tumbleweeds for a hundred years, old hoss.Now: it's amazing that Ang has been able to package up a sliver of Flyover America and make it palatable even---especially!---to the Upper East side Manhattanite's super-chic & utterly sensitive sensibilities: hey, who doesn't like a movie about gay cowboys! Hell, these are the kinds of Blue Staters *we* can dig---you could even, Hell, take these cowpokes---woops, sheep-pokes---to a Broadway show!But edgy and dark it's not. No, Love is not a ""Force of Nature"": it's the chemical and biological bilge that clouds the mind until the breeding is done, and then it's either race the pack of little vermin you spawned or pay child support until you're a poor old geezer eating catfood out of a tin.Or not: the real irony of ""Brokeback"", the real tragic cruelty, is that Jack and Ennis are doing nothing that hasn't been done throughout time, only Mother Nature has no use for them: they're not breeding, and so they've turned into an evolutionary Box Canyon, so to speak. Mother Nature is a real b*tch when it comes down to it: She turns her back on our boys, and the rest just plays out like a gunfight at the Not-O.K. Corral where everybody's packing black talon ammunition and the winner gets an acid bath.Dark and Edgy? Nah, it's just eyeball-rippingly slow and dull, a Lifetime movie with better cinematography.So what we're treated to during the 20 hours this movie takes to unwind is this: lots of strained, mooning looks and glances, a little splendor-in-the-tickle grass by the campfire, and about a century of agonizing over a little innocent putting-from-the-Rough. Sheesh.Acting? It's fine, if you think it's all that hard for two gay Hollywood actors who wear eyeliner and makeup for their roles to 'pretend' to be two gay Wyoming sheep-herders who wear eyeliner and maeup for their roles. Jake Gyllenhaal does his freakish thousand-yard-stare thing in this one, and does it well: he's definitely wearing the chaps in this relationship---by contrast, Heath Ledger is the Nancy, wearing that anxious ""but will you respect me in the morning"" look. The chicks (Anne Hathaway, Michelle Williams) are just props.If Ang Lee had wanted ""Brokeback"" to be truly dangerous and edgy, he would have made a full-bore porn flick and let the MPAA slap the damned thing with an NC-17, and really pushed the sex in our faces: made it one sensuous, liquescent romp of riding and roping and driving those cattle across the plains! Don't gotta understand them, just drive and rope and brand them, Rawhide! Then he could have really marketed the WIDESCREEN version of the flick, for those looking for something really uncut, so to speak.Or at the least, he could have broken up the monotony with a raid by a war party of Apaches, or even had Jack do a little ""Crouching Tiger"" maneuver, chasing Ennis through the trees and prefacing their wild coupling with a little bamboo staff-fighting. That would have rocked, and I would have given this flick at least three stars.Alas, no dice: we just get a prettier version of ""Bridges of Madison County"", which Gylenhaal filling in for Clint and Heath wearing the prairie skirt. Our fathers got John Wayne battling Apaches and Commanches: our generation gets Heath and Jake bumping uglies on the Lone Prairie. Is it any wonder we're messed up?In the end, you'd be better off checking out ""Open Range"", which is basically the same story, only with a gunfight, a hanging, and a helluva lot more sublimation.JSG",5,Oh I can't get a Long Little Doggy!,1145664000,"04 22, 2006",2006,4464,"['Stop', ""'ve"", 'heard', 'one', 'two', 'gay', 'cowboys', 'sheep', 'walk', 'bar', 'Wyoming', 'one', 'cowboy', 'bartender', 'say', 'do', 'serve', 'sheep', 'bar', 'bartender', 'Naaahhh', 'pardner', 'do', 'make', 'mean', 'Buffalo', 'Wings', 'Ba-dump-bump.Anyway', 'Ang', 'Lee', 'up', 'different', 'kind', 'bar', 'Brokeback', 'Mountain', 'tale', 'Love', 'Dare', 'Not', 'Speak', 'Name', '1963', 'Wyoming', 'where', 'men', 'were', '-umm', 'well', 'fairly', 'manly', '-and', 'sheep', 'were', 'pretty', 'damned', 'nervous.It', 'Jack', 'Ennis', 'two', 'sheep-herds', 'who', 'venture', 'out', 'Lone', 'Prair-EE', 'end', 'up', 'driving', 'lot', 'more', 'herd', 'sheep', 'plains', 'Brokeback', 'just', 'not', 'movie', 'Lonnnnng', 'Dear', 'Jesus', 'do', ""n't"", 'even', 'tell', 'nearly', 'eight', 'hours', 'potty', 'break', 'yeah', 'tale', 'anguish', 'terror', 'white-hot', 'bull-riding', 'course', '30', 'years', 'so', 'end', ""'ll"", 'feel', ""'ve"", 'been', 'hanging', 'two', 'Tumbling', 'Tumbleweeds', 'hundred', 'years', 'old', 'hoss.Now', 'amazing', 'Ang', 'been', 'able', 'package', 'up', 'sliver', 'Flyover', 'America', 'make', 'palatable', 'even', '-especially', '-to', 'Upper', 'East', 'side', 'Manhattanite', 'super-chic', 'utterly', 'sensitive', 'sensibilities', 'hey', 'who', ""n't"", 'like', 'movie', 'gay', 'cowboys', 'Hell', 'are', 'kinds', 'Blue', 'Staters', '*we*', 'can', 'dig', '-you', 'could', 'even', 'Hell', 'take', 'cowpokes', '-woops', 'sheep-pokes', '-to', 'Broadway', 'show', 'edgy', 'dark', 'not', 'No', 'Love', 'not', 'Force', 'Nature', 'chemical', 'biological', 'bilge', 'mind', 'breeding', 'done', 'then', 'race', 'pack', 'little', 'vermin', 'spawned', 'pay', 'child', 'support', ""'re"", 'poor', 'old', 'geezer', 'eating', 'catfood', 'tin.Or', 'not', 'real', 'irony', 'Brokeback', 'real', 'tragic', 'cruelty', 'Jack', 'Ennis', 'are', 'doing', 'nothing', ""n't"", 'been', 'done', 'time', 'only', 'Mother', 'Nature', 'use', ""'re"", 'not', 'breeding', 'so', ""'ve"", 'turned', 'evolutionary', 'Box', 'Canyon', 'so', 'speak', 'Mother', 'Nature', 'real', 'b*tch', 'when', 'down', 'back', 'boys', 'rest', 'just', 'out', 'gunfight', 'Not-O.K', 'Corral', 'where', 'everybody', 'packing', 'black', 'talon', 'ammunition', 'winner', 'acid', 'bath.Dark', 'Edgy', 'Nah', 'just', 'eyeball-rippingly', 'slow', 'dull', 'Lifetime', 'movie', 'better', 'cinematography.So', 'what', ""'re"", 'treated', '20', 'hours', 'movie', 'unwind', 'lots', 'strained', 'mooning', 'looks', 'glances', 'little', 'splendor-in-the-tickle', 'grass', 'campfire', 'century', 'agonizing', 'over', 'little', 'innocent', 'putting-from-the-Rough', 'Sheesh.Acting', 'fine', 'think', 'hard', 'two', 'gay', 'Hollywood', 'actors', 'who', 'wear', 'eyeliner', 'makeup', 'roles', ""'pretend"", 'be', 'two', 'gay', 'Wyoming', 'sheep-herders', 'who', 'wear', 'eyeliner', 'maeup', 'roles', 'Jake', 'Gyllenhaal', 'freakish', 'thousand-yard-stare', 'thing', 'one', 'well', 'definitely', 'wearing', 'chaps', 'relationship', '-by', 'contrast', 'Heath', 'Ledger', 'Nancy', 'wearing', 'anxious', 'will', 'respect', 'morning', 'look', 'chicks', 'Anne', 'Hathaway', 'Michelle', 'Williams', 'are', 'just', 'props.If', 'Ang', 'Lee', 'had', 'wanted', 'Brokeback', 'be', 'truly', 'dangerous', 'edgy', 'would', 'have', 'made', 'full-bore', 'porn', 'flick', 'let', 'MPAA', 'slap', 'damned', 'thing', 'NC-17', 'really', 'pushed', 'sex', 'made', 'one', 'sensuous', 'liquescent', 'romp', 'riding', 'roping', 'driving', 'cattle', 'plains', 'Do', ""n't"", 'got', 'ta', 'understand', 'just', 'drive', 'rope', 'brand', 'Rawhide', 'Then', 'could', 'have', 'really', 'marketed', 'WIDESCREEN', 'version', 'flick', 'looking', 'something', 'really', 'uncut', 'so', 'speak.Or', 'least', 'could', 'have', 'broken', 'up', 'monotony', 'raid', 'war', 'party', 'Apaches', 'even', 'had', 'Jack', 'do', 'little', 'Crouching', 'Tiger', 'maneuver', 'chasing', 'Ennis', 'trees', 'prefacing', 'wild', 'coupling', 'little', 'bamboo', 'staff-fighting', 'would', 'have', 'rocked', 'would', 'have', 'given', 'flick', 'least', 'three', 'stars.Alas', 'dice', 'just', 'get', 'prettier', 'version', 'Bridges', 'Madison', 'County', 'Gylenhaal', 'filling', 'Clint', 'Heath', 'wearing', 'prairie', 'skirt', 'fathers', 'got', 'John', 'Wayne', 'battling', 'Apaches', 'Commanches', 'generation', 'Heath', 'Jake', 'bumping', 'uglies', 'Lone', 'Prairie', 'wonder', ""'re"", 'messed', 'up', 'end', ""'d"", 'be', 'better', 'off', 'checking', 'Open', 'Range', 'basically', 'same', 'story', 'only', 'gunfight', 'hanging', 'helluva', 'lot', 'more', 'sublimation.JSG']",N/A
172447,A27FR2C67JPDRS,1417030321,Daryl B,"[4, 4]","Brokeback Mountain is one of those rare movies that addresses a controversial subject, managing to hit a nerve with mainstream America, opening discussion and hopefully opening minds.  And who would have thought that the romantic love story of the year would involve a couple of gay cowboys from the director of Sense and Sensibility and The Hulk?The story centers around two men, Ennis Del Mar, played skillfully by Heath Ledger and Jack Twist, played perfectly by Jake Gyllenhaal.  The two young men, both needing jobs for the summer, find work as sheep herders in the mountains of Wyoming.  During that summer of long days and cool nights, the two men forge a friendship.  One night while trying to endure the extreme cold, the two men stay in the same tent and as they, seemingly as surprised as the viewer, begin a sexual relationship, we see the genesis of a life long, yet secret love affair.Once their summer jobs are over, the two men move on with their lives, starting families but eventually they are drawn back to each other.  As often as possible, the two lovers find ways to spend time with each other but denying themselves the chance at a real relationship because of society's attitude toward homosexuality.This film is beautifully adapted from Ann Proulx's short story and is easily the best movie of 2005 (even though the Academy took the cowards route and gave the award to a lesser film).  Thankfully they awarded the award for Best Director to Ang Lee and gave the Oscar for Best Score to Gustavo Santaolalla for his hauntingly beautiful score---it also recieved the Oscar for Best Adapted Screenplay as well.  Michelle Williams was also brilliant as Alma,  Ennis' long suffering wife who realizes that her husband is in love with his best friend.  The cinematography was incredible as well, like moving paintings of the western landscape.This film is bound to become a classic and will continue to be talked about for years to come.  Love is love, straight or gay, and any film that makes us realize how import love is in our lives, is worth your attention.",5,Run for the Mountains!!!,1140566400,"02 22, 2006",2006,2080,"['Brokeback', 'Mountain', 'one', 'rare', 'movies', 'controversial', 'subject', 'managing', 'hit', 'nerve', 'mainstream', 'America', 'opening', 'discussion', 'hopefully', 'opening', 'minds', 'who', 'would', 'have', 'thought', 'romantic', 'love', 'story', 'year', 'would', 'involve', 'couple', 'gay', 'cowboys', 'director', 'Sense', 'Sensibility', 'Hulk', 'story', 'centers', 'two', 'men', 'Ennis', 'Del', 'Mar', 'played', 'skillfully', 'Heath', 'Ledger', 'Jack', 'Twist', 'played', 'perfectly', 'Jake', 'Gyllenhaal', 'two', 'young', 'men', 'needing', 'jobs', 'summer', 'find', 'work', 'sheep', 'herders', 'mountains', 'Wyoming', 'summer', 'long', 'days', 'cool', 'nights', 'two', 'men', 'forge', 'friendship', 'One', 'night', 'trying', 'endure', 'extreme', 'cold', 'two', 'men', 'stay', 'same', 'tent', 'seemingly', 'as', 'surprised', 'viewer', 'begin', 'sexual', 'relationship', 'see', 'genesis', 'life', 'long', 'yet', 'secret', 'love', 'affair.Once', 'summer', 'jobs', 'are', 'two', 'men', 'move', 'lives', 'starting', 'families', 'eventually', 'are', 'drawn', 'back', 'other', 'As', 'often', 'possible', 'two', 'lovers', 'find', 'ways', 'spend', 'time', 'other', 'denying', 'chance', 'real', 'relationship', 'society', 'attitude', 'homosexuality.This', 'film', 'beautifully', 'adapted', 'Ann', 'Proulx', 'short', 'story', 'easily', 'best', 'movie', '2005', 'even', 'Academy', 'took', 'cowards', 'route', 'gave', 'award', 'lesser', 'film', 'Thankfully', 'awarded', 'award', 'Best', 'Director', 'Ang', 'Lee', 'gave', 'Oscar', 'Best', 'Score', 'Gustavo', 'Santaolalla', 'hauntingly', 'beautiful', 'score', '-it', 'also', 'recieved', 'Oscar', 'Best', 'Adapted', 'Screenplay', 'as', 'well', 'Michelle', 'Williams', 'was', 'also', 'brilliant', 'Alma', 'Ennis', 'long', 'suffering', 'wife', 'who', 'husband', 'love', 'best', 'friend', 'cinematography', 'was', 'incredible', 'as', 'well', 'moving', 'paintings', 'western', 'landscape.This', 'film', 'bound', 'become', 'classic', 'will', 'continue', 'be', 'talked', 'years', 'come', 'Love', 'love', 'straight', 'gay', 'film', 'realize', 'how', 'import', 'love', 'lives', 'attention']",N/A
172448,AJRPOXVAQ4JW0,1417030321,"Dave Clayton ""Wereaardvark""","[2, 15]","According to a famous dictum of Henry David Thoreau, most men lead lives of quiet desperation. In the highly successful film Brokeback Mountain, based upon a short story by E. Annie Proulx, and directed by Ang Lee, the men who exemplify this proposition are a pair of cowboys who pursue a frustrated and frustrating affair over a period of several years. In 1963, while tending sheep in the Wyoming back country, two young men, Jack Twist (Jake Gyllenhal) and Ennis Del Mar (Heath Ledger) end up sharing a tent one cold but frenzied night, during which Ennis anally penetrates Jack. The two men's lives subsequently diverge and both marry.While Ennis' marriage unravels when his wife becomes aware of his attachment to his buddy, Jack moves to Texas and, after sleeping with the daughter of a wealthy businessman, marries her and gets a comfortable job working for daddy. Nevertheless, the two manage to continue their liaison until Jack demands that Ennis live with him. The latter refuses, relating a traumatic experience he had had as a child when an older man living with his friend was beaten to death. When Ennis some time later sends Jack a postcard, it comes back marked ""Deceased,"" and the movie suggests his lover may have been the victim of a similar act of violence.The performances by Ledger and Gyllenhal are the movie's strongest asset. Otherwise Brokeback Mountain is a far from exceptional film. Compositionally mediocre, Lee's production lacks visual imagination, alternating between kitschy panoramas of the great outdoors and dreary views of small towns, gaudy saloons, and the cluttered dwellings of Ennis and Jack. Where Lee's earlier film Eat Drink Man Woman (1994) had a vividly depicted setting in Taipei with sharply observed characters, this movie seems to be taking place on the other side of the moon. Ennis and Jack no doubt deserve a better fate, but so does the audience.The movie falls back upon one of the most durable if dubious myths of American culture: the redeeming power of nature. In the great outdoors nature itself sanctifies the union still unblessed today by the powers that be in the United States. But the tradition was always ambivalent: if the frontier, whether terrestrial or aquatic, tolerated certain kinds of otherwise taboo male relationships, it conveniently quarantined them at the same time. And a price always had to be paid whenever this transgression crossed the border back into civilization. Brokeback Mountain remains faithful to the tradition by killing off Jack and condemning Ennis to a life of celibacy.Brokeback Mountain is a gay cowboy movie, right? Not at all. The movie portrays a homosexual relationship, but it leaves the question of the sexuality of the two men up in the air. Although Jack is shown as a bisexual philanderer whose escapades may have caused his death, Ennis remains a sexually enigmatic Rock of Gibraltar right up to the final fade out. Jean Renoir said of Alfred Hitchcock's Rope, ""It's supposed to be about homosexuals, and you don't even see the boys kiss each other. What's that?"" In this movie, the cowboys do a good deal more than just kiss, but they never manage to put their desires into words. What's that?Many years ago, homosexuality was often euphemistically referred to as ""The love that dares not speak its name."" After 1969, the year of Stonewall, few people would have any longer used the phrase except with ironic contempt. But in an odd way Brokeback Mountain makes that clich&eacute; come literally true. Ennis and Jack are sympathetic characters, but in the way the film presents them, they come across as inarticulate clods. Throughout a long movie the two men directly address each other a handful times.It is only necessary to go back to the 1950s to grasp what is woefully absent from the film. Let us imagine that the movie could have been made at that time with a screenplay by Tennessee Williams and with Elia Kazan as director--a playwright who often depicted outsiders and a director with an incredible talent for transferring such figures to the screen. Without a doubt, the two men would have been pouring their hearts out to each other from reel one. Characters like Terry Malloy in On the Waterfront or Cal in East of Eden are hardly intellectuals, but they express themselves quite effectively--even eloquently at moments.This inarticulateness is quite coherent with the way the movie presents the course of love between the two. Their first encounter is simply wordless, without even being preceded by any of the locker room banter about sex common among straight males. When the two couple in the middle of the night, it is as if God had sent a plague down on them that they can only passively endure. Just to underline the point, the next day Ennis discovers a wolf has killed one of the sheep, an omen of the fate that awaits them. Here we are far away from the still quite realistic territory of Williams and Kazan and closer to celluloid Transylvania where characters become werewolves overnight after violating some taboo. Following the discovery of the dead sheep, I nearly expected Maria Ouspenskaya to show up as a gypsy fortuneteller and see a pentagram on Ennis' chest.Brokeback Mountain allots Ennis and Jack their moments of fleeting pleasure, letting them kiss and even romp about in the nude, but they end up paying for these moments many times over, just like any pair of adulterous lovers in the old days of the Production Code. By contrast, in From Here to Eternity (1951), James Jones introduces a secondary character, Bloom, an Army boxer who is Jewish and a closeted homosexual who blows out his brains in the barracks. Bloom reflects his own internalized hatred for homosexuals of the men around him, but he turns that reflection into an act of violent defiance, not passive submission to the status quo.",2,The Love

172449,A1YQ6QB2127AJ4,1417030321,David Anderson,"[26, 30]","In 1963, two young men Ennis Del Mar and Jack Twist are searching for summer work.  They find this in Brokeback Mountain in a small Wyoming city.  What they find is much more than just summer work; rather, much more than what they expected.  After months of staying in the camp site hurdling sheep and other duties, they find love within one another.  Neither had examined their sexualities before arriving at Brokeback Mountain.  The end of the summer leaves them heartbroken due to the separation.  Ennis stays in Wyoming, marries a woman named Alma, and has two girls.  Jack moves to Texas, intenses his career as a cowboy, marries a woman named Lureen, and has a boy.  Five years later, Ennis and Jack reunite and discover that their love they shared remains.  However, society and the times prevent them from sharing the love as deep as their desires.  This relationship leads to romance and heartbreak.""Brokeback Mountain"", adapted from the short story of the same name by Annie Proulx, was beautifully crafted by its cast and crew.  It proceeded to receive nominations and win several major awards, including eight Oscar nominations (including Best Picture) leading to three wins (Best Director, Best Adapted Screenplay, and Best Original Score).  Its emotional impact remains alive throughout the film.  They beautifully express the characters' pain and turmoil caused by a homophobic society.  This adaptation is one of the best screenplays written in many years.  Few other filmmakers have crafted a storyline that compiles twenty-five years of events within only two hours while sharing its story so deeply.  Its storyline placement and series of events proved highly difficult, yet succeeded in many ways.Many are quick to label ""Brokeback Mountain"" a gay film.  However, it is much more than that.  It is a story of love, secrets, loneliness, and struggle to express their true selves.  This is one of many qualities that make this film so groundbreaking.  Therefore, its viewers will quickly recall the characters Ennis and Jack and how much of an impact they made.  This is the first film with a romance of two people of the same sex as its primary subject line to receive such critical success.  Therefore, this will surely open doors for other filmmakers to continue pushing the envelope.This film could not have been so monumental through its emotional stance if it wasn't for the actors' hard work.  Three of its eight Oscar nominations were for acting: Best Actor (Heath Ledger), Best Supporting Actor (Jake Gyllenhaal), and Best Supporting Actress (Michelle Williams).  For years, Ledger and Gyllenhaal have been underrated talent-wise, despite several wonderful performances (Ledger's ""The Patriot"", ""Monster's Ball""; Gyllenhaal's ""The Good Girl"", ""Donnie Darko"").  Ledger's performance as Ennis, a quiet and lonely man, showcases his talents further than in the past.  Gyllenhaal's performance as Jack, an eccentric and and outgoing man, fits well with Ennis and the overall film.  Williams and Anne Hathaway successfully placed their teenage image aside for the film.  Williams proves that she is much more than just ""Dawson's Creek"" as the lonely and gentle Alma.

Anybody reluctant to see this film can relax because it's not going to change your inclinations.  Is this a great film?  That's debatable but it is a very good one.  I was impressed with a few things about this film primarily the direction by Ang Lee.  He allows the story to develope deliberately.  He doesn't shy away from the provocative nature of Ennis and Jack's relationship but it is told with discretion and taste.  Another thing that impressed me was the towering performance by Heath Ledger as Ennis.  Ennis is a taciturn man who does not verbalize his emotions but allows them to burn inside.  This kind of role in the wrong hands could come off as one note but Ledger pulls it off brilliantly.  Jake Gyllenhall is fine as Jack but his performance pales in comparison to Ledger's.  Great supporting work is offered here by Michelle Williams, Anne Hathaway, Linda Cardellini and Randy Quaid.

172452,A2Q42ON9CEHR4O,1417030321,David R. Eastwood,"[10, 48]","I found BROKEBACK MOUNTAIN a painfully sad experience--wonderfully filmed, as Ang Lee's movies usually are, and well acted, but deeply depressing. It was comparable to watching a slow-motion train wreck on an ironically beautiful, bright sunny day--or reading one of Thomas Hardy's later novels.Neither Ennis Del Mar nor Jack Twist (played by Heath Ledger and Jake Gyllenhaal) was a character that most of us would admire or respect: both were like good-looking Lost Boys who never became responsible adults with the passage of time. Despite their differences in temperaments and experiences, they were like a pair of perpetual Peter Pans, poorly educated, pitifully below average intelligence, and morally irresponsible.Most would agree that our DNA and the vissitudes of life largely determine what handicaps or deficiencies our minds and bodies have, and these normally are factors that nobody ought to be blamed for. But our willpower (or ""won't-power""), especially when it involves honest interactions with others, is usually seen as an entirely different matter. Throughout the film, both Ennis and Jack lead dishonest lives that harm their spouses, their children, themselves, and each other. (BTW, if you think this is harsh, ask yourself how vigorously you would defend a so-called straight married person who is leading a lie-based double life with one or more lovers outside his/her marriage.)If Ennis and Jack had been presented as malicious men, they would not deserve our pity. Instead, they come across as pitifully weak, essentially careless and thoughtless ageing adolescents. We watch their deceitful, destructive behavior with sorrow, knowing that they are incapable of changing for the better--perhaps foolishly hoping their lives will improve somehow but expecting them to worsen.As far as courage and integrity are concerned, the one bright spot in the picture was when Jack Twist stood up to his domineering father-in-law (ably played by L. D. Newsome); sad to say, immediately he fell back into spinelessness and deceit. And the low point for Ennis was when he became violent with his ex-wife when she revealed that she knew he and Jack did not do any fishing on their fishing trips. Perhaps the most poignant scene is when Ennis asks his daughter, Alma Jr. (Kate Mara), if the man she's engaged to marry is in love with her, and she says that he is.The murder of Jack was skillfully foreshadowed and resonates, of course, with events that occur in many U.S. communities today. Sadly coping with this misfortune, Ennis, in the process of trying to fulfill Jack's wish that his ashes be taken to Brokeback Mountain, learns that his lover had been cheating on him with another man. At the end of the film, we can feel certain that he will never find happiness of any sort in the remainder of his own life.Early in his book WALDEN (1854), Thoreau comments, ""The mass of men lead lives of quiet desperation. What is called resignation is confirmed desperation. From the desperate city you go into the desperate country, and have to console yourself with the bravery of minks and muskrats."" The film BROKEBACK MOUNTAIN almost seems designed to illustrate that grim view of humanity.",3,"TWO PETER PANS' ""QUIET DESPERATION""",1146355200,"04 30, 2006",2006,3201,"['found', 'BROKEBACK', 'MOUNTAIN', 'painfully', 'sad', 'experience', 'wonderfully', 'filmed', 'Ang', 'Lee', 'movies', 'usually', 'are', 'well', 'acted', 'deeply', 'depressing', 'was', 'comparable', 'watching', 'slow-motion', 'train', 'wreck', 'ironically', 'beautiful', 'bright', 'sunny', 'day', 'reading', 'one', 'Thomas', 'Hardy', 'later', 'Ennis', 'Del', 'Mar', 'Jack', 'Twist', 'played', 'Heath', 'Ledger', 'Jake', 'Gyllenhaal', 'was', 'character', 'most', 'would', 'admire', 'respect', 'were', 'good-looking', 'Lost', 'Boys', 'who', 'never', 'became', 'responsible', 'adults', 'passage', 'time', 'differences', 'temperaments', 'experiences', 'were', 'pair', 'perpetual', 'Peter', 'Pans', 'poorly', 'educated', 'pitifully', 'average', 'intelligence', 'morally', 'irresponsible.Most', 'would', 'agree', 'DNA', 'vissitudes', 'life', 'largely', 'determine', 'what', 'minds', 'bodies', 'have', 'normally', 'are', 'factors', 'nobody', 'ought', 'be', 'blamed', 'willpower', ""won't-power"", 'especially', 'when', 'honest', 'interactions', 'others', 'usually', 'seen', 'entirely', 'different', 'matter', 'film', 'Ennis', 'Jack', 'lead', 'dishonest', 'lives', 'harm', 'spouses', 'children', 'other', 'BTW', 'think', 'harsh', 'ask', 'how', 'vigorously', 'would', 'defend', 'so-called', 'straight', 'married', 'person', 'who', 'leading', 'lie-based', 'double', 'life', 'one', 'more', 'lovers', 'his/her', 'marriage', 'Ennis', 'Jack', 'had', 'been', 'presented', 'malicious', 'men', 'would', 'not', 'deserve', 'pity', 'Instead', 'come', 'pitifully', 'weak', 'essentially', 'careless', 'thoughtless', 'ageing', 'adolescents', 'watch', 'deceitful', 'destructive', 'behavior', 'sorrow', 'knowing', 'are', 'incapable', 'changing', 'better', 'perhaps', 'foolishly', 'hoping', 'lives', 'will', 'improve', 'somehow', 'expecting', 'worsen.As', 'far', 'courage', 'integrity', 'are', 'concerned', 'one', 'bright', 'spot', 'picture', 'was', 'when', 'Jack', 'Twist', 'stood', 'up', 'domineering', 'father-in-law', 'ably', 'played', 'L.', 'D.', 'Newsome', 'sad', 'say', 'immediately', 'fell', 'back', 'spinelessness', 'deceit', 'low', 'point', 'Ennis', 'was', 'when', 'became', 'violent', 'ex-wife', 'when', 'revealed', 'knew', 'Jack', 'did', 'not', 'do', 'fishing', 'fishing', 'trips', 'Perhaps', 'most', 'poignant', 'scene', 'when', 'Ennis', 'daughter', 'Alma', 'Jr.', 'Kate', 'Mara', 'man', 'engaged', 'marry', 'love', 'murder', 'Jack', 'was', 'skillfully', 'foreshadowed', 'resonates', 'course', 'events', 'occur', 'many', 'U.S.', 'communities', 'today', 'Sadly', 'coping', 'misfortune', 'Ennis', 'process', 'trying', 'fulfill', 'Jack', 'wish', 'ashes', 'be', 'taken', 'Brokeback', 'Mountain', 'lover', 'had', 'been', 'cheating', 'man', 'end', 'film', 'can', 'feel', 'certain', 'will', 'never', 'find', 'happiness', 'sort', 'remainder', 'own', 'life.Early', 'book', 'WALDEN', '1854', 'Thoreau', 'comments', 'mass', 'men', 'lead', 'lives', 'quiet', 'desperation', 'What', 'called', 'resignation', 'confirmed', 'desperation', 'desperate', 'city', 'go', 'desperate', 'country', 'have', 'console', 'bravery', 'minks', 'muskrats', 'film', 'BROKEBACK', 'MOUNTAIN', 'almost', 'designed', 'illustrate', 'grim', 'view', 'humanity']",N/A

For myself, the movie was visually pleasing and refreshing in some ways, too, but I had some problems with what is by now esteemed a virtual classic. I am a middle-aged guy, been around, lived in several states (though not Wyoming), but I have never seen a man cry, not once in my life. In this movie the guys are always crying. They cry when they meet, they cry when they separate, they cry after they kiss, they cry after they fight. Is this believable? In the film, it is 1963 and gay or not, I just don't believe they would have gotten through life intact crying all the time. Somewhere along the way, some male figure would have put them straight on this. They seem to have gotten the message on the shame of their sexuality, is it credible that they could have survived crying their way through high school, through military service, and so on? They would have had to learn the hard way that crying would not be tolerated. This seems like a small point, but for me it is indicative of the overall anachronistic mode of the film, which looks and feels a lot like two 1980s Santa Monica gays time traveling back in the 1960s.

I wish it were earth-shattering news, but apparently word has already gotten out. Curtis and I went to Nashville with a friend of ours to screen the famous same-sex love story between two ranch hands. I expected a similar crowd to that of ""Latter Days,"" which played at the same theatre a couple of year ago.It wasn't. ""Latter Days,"" the Mormon-missionary-loves-the-player love story by director C. Jay Cox drew meager audiences across the country, and drew only a few dozen people the night we saw it. ""Brokeback,"" on the other hand, was a sold-out crowd in the theatre's largest auditorium, one of three screens that showed that film.And almost half of that audience was straight, unless those heterosexual couples were comprised of gay men with their fag hags. There wasn't a dry eye in the audience by the time the closing credits rolled.For those few of you that live under a rock, ""Brokeback Mountain,"" from ""Crouching Tiger"" director Ang Lee, is the story of two ranch hands who work the slopes of the titular mountain while herding sheep in 1963. Jack Twist (Jake Gyllenhal) and Ennis Del Mar (Heath Ledger) are simple, relatively uneducated men who must cope with emerging feelings for each other. Their friendship leads to a cold night in a pup tent, which sparks a passionate romp during which the two men have sex.And no one walked out of the theatre. No one yelled, ""UGH!"" It struck at the very core of those of us who have had similar awkward positions of first love, whether same-sex or not. As uncomfortable as it might have been for the straight men in the audience, they got it too. These two men didn't know how to really express their love for each other. They couldn't kiss (I'll pay well to keep Curtis from telling the story of our first kiss in any detail).But then the movie progresses to detail the fact that it wasn't a ""one-shot deal,"" as Ennis wanted at first. The rest of the summer brought them closer and closer together. Their final parting was bitter, hard, and still awkward.  Of the two actors, Ledger rises far above the brilliant Gyllenhal, especially during a scene immediately after their scuffle in which Ennis must cope with the fact that he's truly in love, even if it's a forbidden love.The rest of the film is a montage of the lives of the two men over the next twenty years, and we're introduced to both of the characters' wives. The complexity of the script is illustrated when Alma, Ennis' wife stumbles on her husband kissing this strange man from Texas who's coming for a fishing visit.Now we know what fishing buddies really are, it seems. Strange how they never fish.""Brokeback"" is clearly Ledger's shining moment, and Gyllenal's performance has its own passion. The chemistry between the two men is real, and the beauty of the cinematography is stunning.""I wish I could quit you,"" Jack tells Ennis later in the story. The power of love that's displayed in ""Brokeback"" is beyond borders, greater than fear, and brilliant even until that final frame.Is it the ""gay cowboy movie,"" as some say? Not really. But it is a powerful love story as only Ang Lee could tell. In the end, ""Brokeback Mountain"" will bury itself into your heart as the force of nature it is. Don't miss it. We drove an hour to see it. I left the theatre in stunned silence as I realized that I was still spellbound by the time I got home.In the end, it's worth the time, the drive, and your ten bucks.

172456,A9VD20X239FSR,1417030321,"Dean Backus ""Hi! How are you today?""","[57, 67]","""Brokeback Mountain"" is, of all things, not dissimilar to ""E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial"" or ""The Sixth Sense,"" in that it casts its spell so deliberately and carefully, you have to pay extra-special attention to it during the set-up.  Some will react with impatience, finding the opening scenes between two taciturn ranch hands meeting and not saying much to each other over a long summer herding sheep in the Wyoming mountains (actually filmed in Canada) too deliberate.  But when the dramatic moments come, they come like a prairie thunderbolt, and you realize with a shock how carefully Ang Lee and his brilliant cast (all sensational, but Ledger and Gyllenhall are iconic) have set up your expectations, have hooked you so throughly that you are hit as if it were a sucker punch.  The longing glances, the quiet moods, the mournful soundtrack, the pristine vistas all contrast with moments where the characters' passions explode--into love, into violence, into heartbreak.  Jack and Ennis' tragedy spills over into the lives of almost everyone they touch, due to societal pressures and the overwhelming suffocation of silent conformity; when, late in the picture, one realizes what his life has been come to and what has been lost, it's a 3-handkerchief moment.  Yes, there's about 1 minute of implied sex--much less explicit than your average PG-13 movie with a male-female couple--but it's the moments before and after the coupling that haunt you: Ledger getting the first kiss of his life, and finally realizing that someone truly loves him; Gyllenhall's amazing tenderness and strength as he tries to corrall a man who's even more resistant than the wild horses and bulls he futilely tries to tame.  Again, this is a movie that fits Ang Lee's oeuvre of charcters at war between their inner passions and desires and a community that encourages conformity and self-denial; it will make you work, and demand much from a filmgoer.

I have waiting and soul searching long and hard to find the appopriate words to fit. I anticipated this movie with great enthusiasm as it was heralded as the next best thing since the wheel all over hollywood. When the reviews came in I was pushed even further in my reverie. Then came the nominations, and I was certain this was 'the one.' I was sadly incorrect in my assumption. This picture is well acted and the cinematography is breath taking. However, it is only a reminder that gay people never get a happy ending in hollywood and even has the nerve to go way beyond that. (Tip: If you have not seen this picture stop reading now as I will reveal the ending.) Ang Lee is a very creative director and Heath Ledger and Jake Gyllenhaal are both extremely good actors. Let me get that out of the way right now. There is a line in a movie called ""The Boys In The Band"" that states 'not all faggots get bumped off at the end of the story.' Unfortunately that is not the case here. Although this is my opinion, the money spent on this disaster could very well have been put to better use. There is no reason whatsoever the lead character has to be brutally murdered in such a violent fasion. Nor was there a reason the scene had to be so long and graphic! There is an entire generation of young people that left the theater or removed this DVD from their home systems thinking this was status quo. That gay people DO always get killed violently, or worse, deserve it. It saddens my heart to think that somewhere a teenager who does not know any better has begun to beleive it! I realize this picture is depicting an era of time where things like this actually did happen. We have, however, come a long way since then and opinions have changed dramatically. We are no longer categorized as sick twisted individuals who must come to a brutal violent ending. There was a simple fix to this: Jakes character could easily have moved to another state and the two men just not see each other anymore. Not in Hollywood dear. It seems the powers that be insisted on the murder, and that is what you are left with. What a tragedy. I lived through the violent years of being gay myself, and am very proud of the struggles and progress we have made. This picture has thrown the gay rights movement back thirty years. The reason I am writing this review is because many people beleive what they read or see or hear. It is with my sincerest hope that this may help someone realize.....it isn't always like it happens in plays or in this case a hollywood movie. There is more to life. I have since thrown out my DVD and the book for fear if I donate it to a library or sell it, it would do more harm than good.

The characters get inside your skin, the haunting loss and yearning in the movie staying with you long, long after you've finished watching the film.I've heard fellow women comment on Jack and Ennis's cheating on their wives, but the point I make to them is that the film isn't about that element.  Well, it is to some degree in that it's a movie about the destruction that having to hide who you are can bring.  But the larger theme I take away from the infidelity is that it's just one more byproduct of what happens when you refuse to stand for something--anything in your life.  What Ennis chooses by allowing his life to go on, year after year, without making a choice to risk everything for love...he winds up making a default choice.Heath Ledger as Ennis DelMar is obviously brilliant, as has been pointed out many times over.  His bottled up rage and frustration, his subtle performance, always dancing on a razor's edge, gives an incendiary quality to the film.Gyllenhaal has been severely underrated, however, at least in this viewer's opinion.  Without his sunnier, inspiring hopefulness in the role of Jack, the movie would find itself almost too much to take.  It's the yin and yang of the actor's portrayals that makes vivid the yin and yang of the men's love for each other.A perfect, beautiful movie in every possible way.

172460,A1FF2KROA1D87,1417030321,Denise P,"[4, 5]","I initially didn't like this film much since I expected an explicit romantic relationship between two gay men, from all the media hype.Instead I found a lack of a relationship due to denial, intolerance, fear and responsibility.I think I'm use to seeing more affection between two people in love as well.I'm afraid I dismissed the whole movie when it's just as creditable and praiseworthy as the Brandon Teena story in the film ""Boys don't cry"" without the numerous fatalities.To my surprise my earlier perhaps abrupt review gave some the impression I was an intolerant extremist with no empathy or understanding for anyone different then myself, when one of the reasons I like film is it offers inclusion into all areas of society.After many comments, misunderstanding and realization, a kind suggestion was made to view the film for a second time to see what it has to offer instead of what I want the film to be.  Since I would like to enjoy and appreciate every movie and feel privileged to read the heart felt comments I received from many individuals, I have gladly viewed the film again.What did I think?  GREAT film...................it's more a drama depicting remnants of a societal forbidden relationship.  There is definitely something for everyone in BBM.  Heath Ledger (as Ennis) and Jake Gyllenhaal (as Jack) are at the very least attractive and vulnerable, two of many elements common with falling in love.Ennis appears to be a quiet reserved hard working realist who wants the type of family he never had and is working toward it.  He seems to be an honorable man who keeps his word and cares about everyone in his life.Jack seems to be a playful, naive and sometimes reckless dreamer aware of his sexuality and wants to go off in the sunset somewhere and live happily ever after with a male partner during the films era of the 1960's.  He just wants to get on with it, living life to the fullest and the heck with what people may say.The two men meet in search of employment sheep herding.Jack is clearly interested in Ennis from first sight and shows off a bit in the only boyish way he knows.  The men work together and a close friendship is formed.  Then slowly and unplanned the bond they share is realized.Intellectually there are layers of emotions and unspoken words that both men are unable to communicate for fear of rejection, persecution, lack of understanding there own feelings, shame, etc.Once there work together ends the realization for Ennis that he may have strong feelings for this other man is powerfully, physically debilitating.  He is barely able to keep his quiet exterior and walk away.  Jack on the other hand seems use to unrequited love along with Ennis's earlier comment that ""this is a one time thing"", appears to handle the separation casually.Ennis proceeds with his prior commitment and gets married.Jack meets and then marries it seems in hope that this ethically acceptable relationship will work.  Neither man is evilly plotting to harm there spouses or future children.  They simply want to live and have some kind of life in this world.A few years later both men realize the passion they initially found hasn't gone away but appears to have become stronger.  The way anyone can feel they are a part of or the soul mate to another.Jacks wife seems to be so self absorbed she has no knowledge of her husband's preference until the end.  Apparently there is prejudice associated with the way a man leaves this earth.Ennis's wife is initially in denial feeling betrayed, then tries to verify her husband's sexuality.  Finally she pulls away from him completely, not understanding, and perhaps feeling shame and possibly disgrace attributed by society's judgments.  She does seem to struggle with loving a man who loves another man.The complexity and intricacy of each character, the acting of everyone in the film including the depicted societal constrains during that era is outstanding.  The cinematography throughout the film is commendable as well.And finally, not only did I find love between Jack and Ennis, but Jack and his son, Ennis and his daughters and even Ennis and his wife (although no longer romantic).I thank those that patiently wanted to understand my point of view in initially not liking the film and feverishly documenting there own views.Instead of my original review of 3 stars I'd rate this movie with 5 stars *****.",5,"Where's the love, it's right here..............",1172620800,"02 28, 2007",2007,4393,"['initially', 'did', ""n't"", 'like', 'film', 'much', 'expected', 'explicit', 'romantic', 'relationship', 'two', 'gay', 'men', 'media', 'hype.Instead', 'found', 'lack', 'relationship', 'due', 'denial', 'intolerance', 'fear', 'responsibility.I', 'think', ""'m"", 'use', 'seeing', 'more', 'affection', 'two', 'people', 'love', 'well.I', ""'m"", 'afraid', 'dismissed', 'whole', 'movie', 'when', 'just', 'creditable', 'praiseworthy', 'Brandon', 'Teena', 'story', 'film', 'Boys', 'do', ""n't"", 'cry', 'numerous', 'fatalities.To', 'surprise', 'earlier', 'perhaps', 'abrupt', 'review', 'gave', 'impression', 'was', 'intolerant', 'extremist', 'empathy', 'understanding', 'anyone', 'different', 'then', 'when', 'one', 'reasons', 'like', 'film', 'inclusion', 'areas', 'society.After', 'many', 'comments', 'misunderstanding', 'realization', 'kind', 'suggestion', 'was', 'made', 'view', 'film', 'second', 'time', 'see', 'what', 'offer', 'instead', 'what', 'want', 'film', 'be', 'would', 'like', 'enjoy', 'appreciate', 'movie', 'feel', 'privileged', 'read', 'heart', 'felt', 'comments', 'received', 'many', 'individuals', 'have', 'gladly', 'viewed', 'film', 'did', 'think', 'GREAT', 'film', '.it', 'more', 'drama', 'depicting', 'remnants', 'societal', 'forbidden', 'relationship', 'definitely', 'something', 'everyone', 'BBM', 'Heath', 'Ledger', 'Ennis', 'Jake', 'Gyllenhaal', 'Jack', 'are', 'very', 'least', 'attractive', 'vulnerable', 'two', 'many', 'elements', 'common', 'falling', 'love.Ennis', 'be', 'quiet', 'reserved', 'hard', 'working', 'realist', 'who', 'type', 'family', 'never', 'had', 'working', 'be', 'honorable', 'man', 'who', 'word', 'cares', 'everyone', 'life.Jack', 'be', 'playful', 'naive', 'sometimes', 'reckless', 'dreamer', 'aware', 'sexuality', 'go', 'off', 'sunset', 'somewhere', 'live', 'happily', 'ever', 'male', 'partner', 'films', 'era', '1960', 'just', 'get', 'living', 'life', 'fullest', 'heck', 'what', 'people', 'may', 'say.The', 'two', 'men', 'meet', 'search', 'employment', 'sheep', 'herding.Jack', 'clearly', 'interested', 'Ennis', 'first', 'sight', 'off', 'bit', 'only', 'boyish', 'way', 'men', 'work', 'together', 'close', 'friendship', 'formed', 'Then', 'slowly', 'unplanned', 'bond', 'share', 'realized.Intellectually', 'are', 'layers', 'emotions', 'unspoken', 'words', 'men', 'are', 'unable', 'communicate', 'fear', 'rejection', 'persecution', 'lack', 'understanding', 'own', 'feelings', 'shame', 'etc.Once', 'there', 'work', 'together', 'realization', 'Ennis', 'may', 'have', 'strong', 'feelings', 'other', 'man', 'powerfully', 'physically', 'debilitating', 'barely', 'able', 'keep', 'quiet', 'exterior', 'walk', 'away', 'Jack', 'other', 'hand', 'use', 'unrequited', 'love', 'Ennis', 'earlier', 'comment', 'one', 'time', 'thing', 'handle', 'separation', 'casually.Ennis', 'proceeds', 'prior', 'commitment', 'married.Jack', 'meets', 'then', 'marries', 'hope', 'ethically', 'acceptable', 'relationship', 'will', 'work', 'man', 'evilly', 'plotting', 'harm', 'spouses', 'future', 'children', 'simply', 'want', 'live', 'have', 'kind', 'life', 'world.A', 'few', 'years', 'later', 'men', 'realize', 'passion', 'initially', 'found', ""n't"", 'gone', 'away', 'have', 'become', 'stronger', 'way', 'anyone', 'can', 'feel', 'are', 'part', 'soul', 'mate', 'another.Jacks', 'wife', 'be', 'so', 'self', 'absorbed', 'knowledge', 'husband', 'preference', 'end', 'Apparently', 'prejudice', 'associated', 'way', 'man', 'earth.Ennis', 'wife', 'initially', 'denial', 'feeling', 'betrayed', 'then', 'verify', 'husband', 'sexuality', 'Finally', 'away', 'completely', 'not', 'understanding', 'perhaps', 'feeling', 'shame', 'possibly', 'disgrace', 'attributed', 'society', 'judgments', 'seem', 'struggle', 'loving', 'man', 'who', 'man.The', 'complexity', 'intricacy', 'character', 'acting', 'everyone', 'film', 'including', 'depicted', 'societal', 'constrains', 'era', 'outstanding', 'cinematography', 'film', 'commendable', 'well.And', 'finally', 'not', 'only', 'did', 'find', 'love', 'Jack', 'Ennis', 'Jack', 'son', 'Ennis', 'daughters', 'even', 'Ennis', 'wife', 'no', 'longer', 'romantic', '.I', 'thank', 'patiently', 'wanted', 'understand', 'point', 'view', 'initially', 'not', 'liking', 'film', 'feverishly', 'documenting', 'there', 'own', 'views.Instead', 'original', 'review', '3', 'stars', ""'d"", 'rate', 'movie', '5', 'stars', '*****']",N/A

Such a little thing as the word ""gay"" should never stop anyone from seeing this.I'm a big fan of Heath Ledger's since A Knight's Tale, but I wasn't so much of a fan of Jake Gyllenhall's till I saw this.  Their acting is absolutely superb, and came completely from the heart.  They were each very expressive, and I didn't even feel as though I was watching a movie--I felt like I was right there with them, experiencing what they felt.It doesn't matter that they are both men.  It's love--we've all felt it before, in one way or another.  It's heartbreaking, it's wonderful, and it's impossible to live without, and this movie shows that rollercoaster ride perfectly.I enjoy watching westerns too, and I don't think that this destroyed any of the wonderful history that westerns have.  That's such a closed-minded way to think.  Rather, I think this movie paid homage to westerns and cowboys alike--I have a new respect for how tough real cowboys are, after seeing the work these two ranch hands had to accomplish for practically no pay!  This movie by no means tries to express that all cowboys are gay.All in all, this is a heart warming story that's wonderfully told and done.  I wanted to see what all the fuss was about after reading the short story--while I thought the story was good, I never thought it could be retold this well on the silver screen.  Honestly one of the best ""book-to-movie"" flicks I've ever seen.  Great casting, believable acting and breathtaking shots.  Don't miss this one.

I happened to come across this movie on HBO one night and was immediately drawn in.  I really appreciated it as a work of art and social commentary.  It tells a great story without having to say a whole lot.  Perhaps this movie came out at just the right time - with the White House pushing for an ammendment to ban gay marriage and states putting the question of gay marriage up to a vote.Ang Lee directed what I would consider an accurate portrayal about the consequences of being forced into the closet.  Art imitates life like never before in this movie.  We've seen gay men with wives and children in politics outed (NJ Gov. McGreevey), and men in the entertainment industry caught living the lie.  What this movie does is show that being unaccepting of gays and forcing them into the closet is not only devistating for them, but for the women and children who unwittingly end up as victims to the closeting.  In my opinion, this is where the movie shines most.  Their relationships with their families are predictably horrible.  I tried to imagine myself in a reverse situation where I would be inclined to form a relationship with a man in order to live in a society unaccepting of who I really am.  Frankly, I wouldn't be able to do it.I agree with most reviewers in their praise of Brokeback Mountain.  The acting is very good.  The direction is outstanding.  I do have a few complaints though.  The sound is absolutely horrible.  Much of the dialogue could use subtitles.  The premise is a bit of a stretch too.  The love affair transcends decades despite no communication between them except for a few words on a post card to setup a trip together.  Long distance relationships are difficult when the two parties are in constant communication.  With the infrequency of their time together and hardly any communication in between, the two men would be more like strangers than to one another than a couple.  I also found that Jack's parents were needlessly odd, but we only see them for five minutes.",4,"If Nothing Else, This Film Will Give You Something To Think About",1165536000,"12 8, 2006",2006,2113,"['First', 'all', 'straight', 'male', 'was', 'not', 'interested', 'watching', 'love', 'story', 'two', 'men', 'happened', 'come', 'movie', 'HBO', 'one', 'night', 'was', 'immediately', 'drawn', 'really', 'appreciated', 'work', 'art', 'social', 'commentary', 'great', 'story', 'having', 'say', 'whole', 'lot', 'Perhaps', 'movie', 'came', 'out', 'just', 'right', 'time', 'White', 'House', 'pushing', 'ammendment', 'ban', 'gay', 'marriage', 'states', 'putting', 'question', 'gay', 'marriage', 'up', 'vote.Ang', 'Lee', 'directed', 'what', 'would', 'consider', 'accurate', 'portrayal', 'consequences', 'being', 'forced', 'closet', 'Art', 'life', 'never', 'before', 'movie', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'gay', 'men', 'wives', 'children', 'politics', 'outed', 'NJ', 'Gov', 'McGreevey', 'men', 'entertainment', 'industry', 'caught', 'living', 'lie', 'What', 'movie', 'show', 'being', 'unaccepting', 'gays', 'forcing', 'closet', 'not', 'only', 'devistating', 'women', 'children', 'who', 'unwittingly', 'end', 'up', 'as', 'victims', 'closeting', 'opinion', 'where', 'movie', 'most', 'relationships', 'families', 'are', 'predictably', 'horrible', 'tried', 'imagine', 'reverse', 'situation', 'where', 'would', 'be', 'inclined', 'form', 'relationship', 'man', 'order', 'live', 'society', 'unaccepting', 'who', 'really', 'am', 'Frankly', 'would', ""n't"", 'be', 'able', 'do', 'it.I', 'agree', 'most', 'reviewers', 'praise', 'Brokeback', 'Mountain', 'acting', 'very', 'good', 'direction', 'outstanding', 'do', 'have', 'few', 'complaints', 'sound', 'absolutely', 'horrible', 'Much', 'dialogue', 'could', 'use', 'subtitles', 'premise', 'bit', 'stretch', 'too', 'love', 'affair', 'decades', 'communication', 'few', 'words', 'post', 'card', 'setup', 'trip', 'together', 'Long', 'distance', 'relationships', 'are', 'difficult', 'when', 'two', 'parties', 'are', 'constant', 'communication', 'infrequency', 'time', 'together', 'hardly', 'communication', 'two', 'men', 'would', 'be', 'more', 'strangers', 'one', 'couple', 'also', 'found', 'Jack', 'parents', 'were', 'needlessly', 'odd', 'only', 'see', 'five', 'minutes']",N/A
172468,A30EH53Y32NUTT,1417030321,"Doctor Whom ""The Doctor""","[7, 19]","This was deleted somehow, so I am re-entering it.Ennis, the Taciturn Blond Guy, is the center of this movie. He says that he is not gay, and he is not gay. He is damaged, and cannot love anyone. For Ennis, love is a post traumatic stress disorder. As a child, his father had forced him to see a freshly murdered and mutilated gay guy- freshly enough killed that Dad might have been a material witness, at least. Then, Ennis' parents died in a car crash, and Ennis was raised indifferently by his sister. By the time we meet handsome, fit Ennis at age 21 or so, he has never had sex.He accepts his first love from Jack, who is gay. Ennis craves affection from Jack, but can give nothing back- no loving commitment. Is it because of viewing the murder victim, which would symbolize societal oppression of gay love? Well, Ennis cannot love his wife or kids, either. When Ennis goes away with Jack for phony fishing trips, he brings no fish or other gifts home for his kids, or his wife. What loving man would disrespect his children so, let alone his wife? Ennis favors Jack not because Ennis is gay, but because Jack will love him without requiring commitment.Jack gives up trying to make a life with Ennis, and finds some one else. Jack is murdered, as Ennis learns when he tries to arrange another secret rendezvous. Ennis' response to the horrid news is shock, loss, and grief- but NOT remorse or regret. Ennis does not say that if he had loved Jack as he might have, Jack would not have died. Ennis feels enormous loss, but no guilt or shame.As far as we can tell, and unlike what is the case with Jack, Ennis has no gay sex- and maybe no sex- after his divorce with anyone except Jack.After Jack dies, Ennis visits Jack's childhood home, where he encounters Jack's stereotyped, gay son-producing parents. Father is cold, and resentful of Jack and Mother's closeness. ""He thought he was too good to be buried with us"", says Dad. Warm and understanding Mom leads Ennis to Jack's bedroom, where Ennis finds the shirt Jack stole from him decades ago hanging with Jack's Jacket. Mom lets Ennis take the package, sending her son's loving soul home with Ennis.This is not a gay movie, making a case that gay love is better than any other, but only makes the case that gay love is as real as any other. As in many other movies featuring a gay character, the gay guy must die to satisfy the audience.I believe the movie is a hit because this is not a gay movie, and because as in traditional movies, the gay guy is punished with death.This is a movie about whether or not a man- Ennis- can love.My favorite scene is toward the end, when Ennis is admiring the numbers on his mailbox. He has an address, so he must exist! As is true on the internet, however, an address may not represent a real identity. Ennis has no identity- he can identify with no one, until at last he consents to go to the wedding of his daughter, who is nicknamed Junior.",4,not a gay movie,1141776000,"03 8, 2006",2006,2937,"['was', 'deleted', 'somehow', 'am', 're-entering', 'it.Ennis', 'Taciturn', 'Blond', 'Guy', 'center', 'movie', 'not', 'gay', 'not', 'gay', 'damaged', 'can', 'not', 'love', 'anyone', 'Ennis', 'love', 'post', 'traumatic', 'stress', 'disorder', 'child', 'father', 'had', 'forced', 'see', 'freshly', 'murdered', 'mutilated', 'gay', 'guy-', 'freshly', 'enough', 'killed', 'Dad', 'might', 'have', 'been', 'material', 'witness', 'least', 'Then', 'Ennis', 'parents', 'died', 'car', 'crash', 'Ennis', 'was', 'raised', 'indifferently', 'sister', 'time', 'meet', 'handsome', 'fit', 'Ennis', 'age', '21', 'so', 'never', 'had', 'sex.He', 'accepts', 'first', 'love', 'Jack', 'who', 'gay', 'Ennis', 'affection', 'Jack', 'can', 'give', 'nothing', 'back-', 'loving', 'commitment', 'viewing', 'murder', 'victim', 'would', 'symbolize', 'societal', 'oppression', 'gay', 'love', 'Well', 'Ennis', 'can', 'not', 'love', 'wife', 'kids', 'either', 'When', 'Ennis', 'away', 'Jack', 'phony', 'fishing', 'trips', 'fish', 'other', 'gifts', 'home', 'kids', 'wife', 'What', 'loving', 'man', 'would', 'disrespect', 'children', 'so', 'let', 'alone', 'wife', 'Ennis', 'favors', 'Jack', 'not', 'Ennis', 'gay', 'Jack', 'will', 'love', 'requiring', 'commitment.Jack', 'up', 'trying', 'make', 'life', 'Ennis', 'one', 'else', 'Jack', 'murdered', 'Ennis', 'when', 'arrange', 'secret', 'rendezvous', 'Ennis', 'response', 'horrid', 'news', 'shock', 'loss', 'grief-', 'NOT', 'remorse', 'regret', 'Ennis', 'not', 'say', 'had', 'loved', 'Jack', 'might', 'have', 'Jack', 'would', 'not', 'have', 'died', 'Ennis', 'enormous', 'loss', 'guilt', 'shame.As', 'far', 'can', 'tell', 'what', 'case', 'Jack', 'Ennis', 'gay', 'sex-', 'maybe', 'sex-', 'divorce', 'anyone', 'Jack.After', 'Jack', 'Ennis', 'Jack', 'childhood', 'home', 'where', 'Jack', 'stereotyped', 'gay', 'son-producing', 'parents', 'Father', 'cold', 'resentful', 'Jack', 'Mother', 'closeness', 'thought', 'was', 'too', 'good', 'be', 'buried', 'Dad', 'Warm', 'understanding', 'Mom', 'Ennis', 'Jack', 'bedroom', 'where', 'Ennis', 'shirt', 'Jack', 'stole', 'decades', 'hanging', 'Jack', 'Jacket', 'Mom', 'Ennis', 'take', 'package', 'sending', 'son', 'loving', 'soul', 'home', 'Ennis.This', 'not', 'gay', 'movie', 'making', 'case', 'gay', 'love', 'better', 'other', 'only', 'case', 'gay', 'love', 'as', 'real', 'other', 'many', 'other', 'movies', 'featuring', 'gay', 'character', 'gay', 'guy', 'must', 'die', 'satisfy', 'audience.I', 'believe', 'movie', 'hit', 'not', 'gay', 'movie', 'because', 'traditional', 'movies', 'gay', 'guy', 'punished', 'death.This', 'movie', 'not', 'man-', 'Ennis-', 'can', 'love.My', 'favorite', 'scene', 'end', 'when', 'Ennis', 'admiring', 'numbers', 'mailbox', 'address', 'must', 'exist', 'true', 'internet', 'however', 'address', 'may', 'not', 'represent', 'real', 'identity', 'Ennis', 'identity-', 'can', 'identify', 'one', 'last', 'go', 'wedding', 'daughter', 'who', 'nicknamed', 'Junior']",N/A
172469,A1AYEI2SNFPYES,1417030321,Dogville,"[4, 5]","Having read the original short story by Proulx a few years ago, I was surprised by how well a tale of love between two cowboys set against a panaromic Wyoming backdrop was told. When I learned that the 60-page short story would become a film directed by celebrated director Lee Ang, I hoped it would be made soon.By now, most people would have associated Brokeback Mountain with gay forbidden love. The truth is, Brokeback Mountain is just a very simple tale of arduous love and anyone with an ounce of emotion should watch.The union of director Lee Ang, scriptwriters Larry McMurtry and Diana Ossana, and the cast results in one of the most exquisite and endearing films made in the last few years.Lee Ang possesses the talent for slow, intricate and subtle film direction. He pays attention to almost every aspect from simple small gestures to complex emotional strifes set against the magnificent mountain view.McMurtry and Ossana also adapted the story faithfully except for the fact that the two male leads were originally much less desirable than Ledger and Gyllenhaal with bucked-tooth and stocky bodies.The assembled cast is the third link which leads the film to flight. Heath Ledger, the stoic straight-man type is caught unexpectedly in a tangled web of emotions for a fellow cowboy, something that had never crossed his less-than-queer mind. A man of few words, Ledger plays Ennis to perfection when he displays the inner turmoil that Ennis enountered trying to live his life the way it is and learning to love Jack. Every time Ledger breaks down and cries in the film, it's when you'll feel him.Jake Gyllenhaal is the hopeful companion who prays for the day that the union could yield the type of permanence he so craved for instead of ""a couple of high-altitude fs once or twice in a year."" And he waited for 20 years until the audience shares his anguish and unfulfilled yearnings by the time he lashed out on what they ever have left is Brokeback Mountain.Michelle Williams plays the silent, long-suffering wife who witnessed the earth-shattering and ultimately heartbreaking kiss shared between Ennis and Jack after 4 years of separation. Williams is exceptionally sorrowful, swallowing her unspoken hurt until she could hold it no more that she wanted to hear the truth out of Ennis' mouth years after her remarriage. Williams' acting powress is certainly validated by the expression she showed at the instance of that unexpected kiss and the heartwrenching exchange with Ledger.Anne Hathaway plays a rich girl whose expertise is in making money not relationships. Given her short screentime, her change from a brash rich rodeo queen to a high-society career woman and finally a emotionless and grieving widow expands her acting abilities beyond her impish Princess Diary-self.Many unions, liasions and break-ups later, Brokeback Mountain emerges as a tragic yet bittersweet and endearing tale of love between four suffering people afflicted with varying degrees of attachment but all not willing to let go. To me, this suffices as more than a gay cowboy story. To enjoy Brokeback Mountain, an open mind and eyes are definitely pre-requisites.

172470,A3RTMB76CJWY9U,1417030321,DonAthos,"[21, 23]","The Movie:Brokeback Mountain is about two men who work together one summer in extreme isolation. They form a deep bond during their time there and eventually sleep together. Because homosexuality is not accepted in their time and place (1960's Wyoming), they deal with conflicted emotions and go their seperate ways into marriages. While married, they reunite from time to time, taking trips to Brokeback Mountain where they continue an on-again, off-again affair lasting several years.The two men feel differently about their relationship. Ennis (Heath Ledger) cannot bring himself to terms with it, and feels that it must always be hidden, in the shadows. His marriage suffers cruelly from it. Jack (Jake Gyllenhaal), however, wants to embrace their relationship more fully (ironically, perhaps, he has the better family life, though it is always hollow for him). Ultimately, their relationship ends tragically. Ennis' family dissolves and Jack is beaten to death on account of his homosexuality.The film is quiet and powerful. The score and backdrops are sweeping and majestic. The acting is top-notch. The direction, excellent. The emotions, real. However one feels about the subject matter, this is a great film.Its Reactions:I have found the reactions to this film to be quite surprising. Friends, of whom I had never suspected any sort of bigotry, refused to go see it and only spoke of it with either irony or derision in their voices. And we can see in the reviews of this film here on Amazon (and the helpful/unhelpful votes) that it has provoked something intense and deeply-seated in many people.It is my opinion that love is love (though, so the reader understands my personal context, I am both a straight man and politically conservative). I understand that some others feel that the portrayal of homosexual love is part of some ""agenda""--they call it propaganda--but I don't think that, just because a movie presents a different point of view than your own, it makes it somehow sinister or manipulative. I hope that everyone here who takes the time to rate these reviews or write their own has taken time to watch the film, prior to commmenting on it. I think that the film, itself, proves that it is not out to manipulate or ""change society"" except in the ways that art always does, by ""holding the mirror up"" and allowing us to examine ourselves.Obviously, this was an important movie to make. The reactions prove it. While I had suspected that society was a little more sophisticated than to go crazy over a film like this, I was wrong. This is a dialogue we need to have. And so, to those who've seen the film and still wish to attack it, I actually want to thank you: while I disagree with what you believe, and the reasons you have for your attacks, its good that we have a chance to talk about it.Five stars for the film itself and five stars for the important discussion it has launched.",5,The Movie and Its Reactions **SPOILERS**,1141257600,"03 2, 2006",2006,2911,"['Movie', 'Brokeback', 'Mountain', 'two', 'men', 'who', 'work', 'together', 'one', 'summer', 'extreme', 'isolation', 'form', 'deep', 'bond', 'time', 'eventually', 'sleep', 'together', 'homosexuality', 'not', 'accepted', 'time', 'place', '1960', 'Wyoming', 'deal', 'conflicted', 'emotions', 'go', 'seperate', 'ways', 'marriages', 'married', 'reunite', 'time', 'time', 'taking', 'trips', 'Brokeback', 'Mountain', 'where', 'continue', 'on-again', 'off-again', 'affair', 'lasting', 'several', 'years.The', 'two', 'men', 'feel', 'differently', 'relationship', 'Ennis', 'Heath', 'Ledger', 'can', 'not', 'bring', 'terms', 'feels', 'must', 'always', 'be', 'hidden', 'shadows', 'marriage', 'suffers', 'cruelly', 'Jack', 'Jake', 'Gyllenhaal', 'however', 'embrace', 'relationship', 'more', 'fully', 'ironically', 'perhaps', 'better', 'family', 'life', 'always', 'hollow', 'Ultimately', 'relationship', 'tragically', 'Ennis', 'family', 'dissolves', 'Jack', 'beaten', 'death', 'account', 'homosexuality.The', 'film', 'quiet', 'powerful', 'score', 'backdrops', 'are', 'sweeping', 'majestic', 'acting', 'top-notch', 'direction', 'excellent', 'emotions', 'real', 'However', 'one', 'feels', 'subject', 'matter', 'great', 'film.Its', 'Reactions', 'have', 'found', 'reactions', 'film', 'be', 'quite', 'surprising', 'Friends', 'whom', 'had', 'never', 'suspected', 'sort', 'bigotry', 'refused', 'go', 'see', 'only', 'spoke', 'irony', 'derision', 'voices', 'can', 'see', 'reviews', 'film', 'here', 'Amazon', 'helpful/unhelpful', 'votes', 'provoked', 'something', 'intense', 'deeply-seated', 'many', 'people.It', 'opinion', 'love', 'love', 'reader', 'personal', 'context', 'am', 'straight', 'man', 'politically', 'conservative', 'understand', 'others', 'feel', 'portrayal', 'homosexual', 'love', 'part', 'agenda', 'call', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'just', 'movie', 'different', 'point', 'view', 'own', 'somehow', 'sinister', 'manipulative', 'hope', 'everyone', 'here', 'who', 'time', 'rate', 'reviews', 'write', 'own', 'taken', 'time', 'watch', 'film', 'prior', 'commmenting', 'think', 'film', 'not', 'manipulate', 'change', 'society', 'ways', 'art', 'always', 'holding', 'mirror', 'up', 'allowing', 'examine', 'ourselves.Obviously', 'was', 'important', 'movie', 'make', 'reactions', 'prove', 'had', 'suspected', 'society', 'was', 'little', 'more', 'sophisticated', 'go', 'crazy', 'film', 'was', 'wrong', 'dialogue', 'need', 'have', 'so', 'who', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'film', 'still', 'wish', 'attack', 'actually', 'want', 'thank', 'disagree', 'what', 'believe', 'reasons', 'have', 'attacks', 'good', 'have', 'chance', 'talk', 'it.Five', 'stars', 'film', 'five', 'stars', 'important', 'discussion', 'launched']",N/A

He comes from a difficult background and seemingly broken home.  He takes a job as a rancher and meets Jack.  Jack is a rancher working rodeo.  Their bosss (Randy Quaid) has them working on the top of Brokeback Mountain isolated from the rest of the world.  The two men bond like good friends.  One cold evening Jack invited Enniss into his tent so that he can keep warm.  They soon find themselves embroiled in passion. It's the sixties and homosexuality between Wyoming cowboys is taboo.

have on people, especially when it comes from the most unexpected places.  it also speaks loads about the way some places in america engender a way of thinking.  ennis is the prime example of this thinking.  as a boy he was shown a hate crime by his father and to ennis that is what will happen to him if he and jack twist were to be together.  although ennis does not speak very much, when he does open his mouth he means what he says.  he is the type of character that really does think before he speaks and acts.  he is a very simple man, but on the inside he is full of conflict.  everything is very basic and straightforward, he knows what he can and cant do.  he really only comes out of his shell and is his true self only when he believes that people are not looking.  ennis is the realist and jack is the optimist.  jack can see them together and wants them to be together.  he sees a future for them and is completely crushed every time he has to leave ennis because it can never be how he wants it to.  ennis states that ""if you cant fix it then you have to stand it.""  that is the truest statement in the movie.  it holds true for both men, but it seems to manifest in different ways for them.  this movies gathers it's power from basic human needs.  the whole relationship stems from the need to be with another person, not only emotionally but physically as well.  both men are thrown together and the reason they turn to each other is because they only have each other.  the fact that each man realizes that the love they share is pure is also the root of their torment.  both do what is expected of them from society, married and children, however neither one can really shake the other.  both men hold onto the love that they share.  both of their lives would be simpler if they could let each other go but love in its most basic form will not release them from it's bonds.  eventually one falls to the reality that ennis fears the most, and in my opinion the other is left to regret not being able to have said goodbye or for that matter be with the one person he truly loved.  everything about this movie is moving.  i think that it is a shame that heath ledger is garnering most of the attention for this movie.  i do not mean that he does not do a good job, he is excellent as ennis del mar.  however, there are two actors in this movie and jake gyllenhall deserves just as much praise as ledger.  i think that this movies stands a very good chance to capture the oscar for best picture and i think that it would be a great day if a movie dealing with gay issues of this magnitude would be step forward in the constant war of equal rights.  this movie shows that there is love between same sexes and the only reason that it is hidden is because society cant handle what it finds different and i think that this movie shows that love is love no matter who you give it to and who it is shared with.",5,VERY EMOTIONAL EXPERIENCE,1136246400,"01 3,

172480,A13E0ARAXI6KJW,1417030321,Ed Uyeshima,"[39, 45]","It shouldn't surprise anyone that the opening weekend in San Francisco was completely sold out for this much anticipated film. I just read the brief, wondrous novella by Annie Proulx a couple of weeks ago, and despite its wellspring of emotion, the 55-page book didn't seem like a natural candidate for screen treatment, especially one with a running time of 134 minutes. What is most intriguing about director Ang Lee's 2005 cinematic adaptation is how it builds upon the elliptical nature of Proulx's narrative into something quite transcendent and relevant beyond urban, flavor-of-the-month movie audiences.Thanks primarily to an extremely perceptive screenplay by Larry McMurtry and Diana Ossana, the much-discussed gay romance is not what separates this film from others but rather the penetrating depiction of the barriers that keep the two cowboys apart. As Lee has proven in previous films that go beyond his cultural identity, he can take what seems to be a niche subject and turn it into a love story with universal appeal to anyone facing an inhospitable environment. I join the chorus who feels it would be shame if potential viewers skip this movie on the preconceived and misbegotten notion that it is simply  a ""gay cowboy"" romance.Initially set on the mountain of the movie's title in Wyoming, the plot focuses on taciturn ranch hand Ennis Del Mar and animated bull-rider Jack Twist, both hired for low wages to herd sheep during the summer of 1963. One cold night, after we see several scenes where they get to know each other and acclimate themselves to their roles, they enter reluctantly into a passionate tryst. While the more open-minded Jack is excited by the feeling of liberation, Ennis is steadfast in his self-inflicted shame and rejects Jack's dream to own a ranch together. Having witnessed as a child the remains of a man lynched for carrying on a gay relationship, Ennis is afraid of the same fate. However, they both recognize an intractable bond that they try to ignore with great futility.Four years elapse, during which time both get married and have children. Ennis marries longtime sweetheart Alma and raises two daughters. Jack has since moved to Texas and married Lureen, the daughter of a big-time farm equipment dealer. He decides to come back and visit Ennis, and their pent-up passion is sparked and becomes unbridled. They begin to take romantic getaways together for the next two decades under the guise of fishing trips. A twist of fate brings Ennis an open resignation to his unresolved feelings even as his now-grown up daughter attempts to get to know him.The performances are uniformly strong. Jake Gyllenhaal portrays Jack in his familiar, wide-eyed manner since it fits his character's more idealistic personality, though he becomes marginally less convincing when he ages. As the wives, both actresses are removing the shackles of previously limiting roles. A graduate of the TV teen-angst soap opera, ""Dawson's Creek"", Michelle Williams continues the promise she showed in Thomas McCarthy's ""The Station Agent"" by revealing the increasing pain and unrelenting sadness in Alma, alternately realizing and denying what is going on between Jack and her husband. Anne Hathaway seems to be jettisoning her goody image from Garry Marshall's ""The Princess Diaries"" in a hurry as Lureen - first as a feisty rodeo girl not afraid to get sexually aggressive with Jack and then in a series of unfortunate blond wigs (from Farrah to Loni Anderson), as a savvy businesswoman growing indifferent to her husband's lack of attention. It's the smallest, least developed part of the four principals, but she makes her moments count.However, it is Heath Ledger who amazes as Ennis. This heretofore almost strictly commercial actor has tapped deeply into the agony of his character's soul with authentic force and poignancy. It's a career-defining performance of a man who cannot let his internal stirrings affect his outward appearance. It's Ledger who makes the intimate scenes between Ennis and Jack seem so desperately charged with emotion and regret. Smaller roles are filled expertly - Randy Quaid as the suspicious sheepherder boss; Linda Cardellini - completely unrecognizable as bespectacled Velma from the ""Scooby Doo"" movies - as the waitress who tries hard to bring out Ennis' heart; and Kate Mara as Ennis's loving daughter. The panoramic vistas of Wyoming (actually Canada) are provided by Rodrigo Prieto's stunning cinematography, and the evocative music score is by Gustavo Santaolalla, who did similarly stellar work in Walter Salles's ""The Motorcycle Diaries"".  I am hopeful there is a broader audience than the enraptured critics, as the rest of us are also being rewarded with a superbly executed film.",5,"A Soaring Ledger Emboldens Lee's Powerful, Evocative

It's unfortunate that film reviewers like Michael Medved went on the air and, channeling his inner eight-year-old girl, said ""Ieeewww"" when asked about this movie, or that over the hill Hollywood actors like Tony Curtis and Ernest Borgnine saw fit to proclaim they'd never vote for a movie like ""Brokeback"" for Best Picture.  It's unfortunate because ""Brokeback"" is an excellent film, and it's an incredible story of heartbreak and loss.""Brokeback Mountain"" is both epic and intimate.  Set against the openness of the West (gorgeously photographed by Rodrigo Prieta who does double duty playing a Mexican hustler in the film), ""Brokeback"" is no allegorical love story; it's the painfully realistic tale of Jack and Ennis, the ""pair of deuces going nowhere"".  Jake Gyllenhaal and Heath Ledger, especially Ledger, do an excellent job portraying two men who fall in love, even if they can't really understand or want to understand what they're feeling.All the actors are well cast, but again, Ledger steals this movie away as Ennis del Mar.  The final shot of Ledger's face is as haunting as that of Giulietta Masina's in ""Nights of Cabiria"".  This is one of those movies where everything just comes together so well, (the music, the cinematography, the acting, the mood) that your faith that good movies can still be made is renewed.I really hope that everybody who said nasty things about this film (and turned the movie into a national punchline) will take advantage of the relative anonymity of home video and see it.

Affectionately dubbed the ""gay cowboy movie,"" viewers everywhere giggle naughtily whenever it's mentioned. However, those who cannot get past that will seriously be remiss in viewing one of the most powerful love stories of all time.This is the story of Ennis Del Mar and Jack Twist, two cowboys who meet each other in the summer of 1963 deep in the mountains of Wyoming. They are both hired to herd and protect a large flock of sheep through the mountains for several months. Every day their friendship progresses little by little as they spend the summer working with only one another. One night they are shocked to discover that their friendship had transformed them into lovers. This begins a tumultuous relationship that spans twenty years of broken relationships, deception, and ultimate tragedy.This film is amazing in every sense of the word. It is beautifully directed and executed. The stunning cinematography displays the stark beauty of the American wilderness that mirrors the wild, untamed love between Ennis and Jack.Heath and Jake's performances were legendary. I honestly have never seen better performances from two straight male actors in terms of heartrending, accurate portrayals of homosexual men during a critical time of the history of American society. This is a story that is moving and haunting. It stays with you and reverberates through your soul for a long time.

I and a great number of people I know--churchgoers, executives, professionals, garage mechanics, athletes etc.--have been nearly unanimous in admitting that this film broke their hearts whether they were straight (a majority of those I know) or gay. ""Brokeback"" reaches deep into the spirit to touch the existential loneliness we all feel, however loved we may feel ourselves in this life. Amid the stark contrast of lush cinematography of the natural world and the bleakness of man's deteriorating structures, Ennis and Jack have a gnawing hunger to escape this loneliness through each other, and, when that proves impossible because of the interdiction imposed by the time and place, through what passes for a ""normal"" life of marriage and children. This is a disaster for Ennis and Jack both, a profound agony for Alma, a painful realized truth for Lureen, and aching sadness for Ennis' daughter, Alma Jr.Everyone knows the story by now, but you have to be there as so many people have commented to me, when Ennis breaks down in Jack's arms at (what they don't know to be) their final meeting. Ennis realizes for all of us, whatever our lives have been, the crashing of the house of cards we've built on an emotional relationship--the fear of changes Stevie Nicks sings about in ""Landslide."" He is facing the Void and is himself empty.This film has more depth than any other I've seen in a long time, surely the best by a hundred miles in the last year, including ""Crash"". Ledger's performance is way beyond what his young years would make us expect. It is a finely textured rendering of a lost soul barely holding it together--not even the estimable Ang Lee could have gotten that out of an actor less supremely talented; Gyllenhaal brings his ""A"" game as a perfect counterpoint to Ledger. All of the women are amazing, right down to the waitress who fruitlessly falls in love with Ennis.This is a ""must-see"" film for anyone whose god is not a homophobe, for this is not a ""gay"" film by any means, though it includes gay people as just another part of the human family, which is what they are. This is the story  of the human heart stripped to a sad ultimate truth. We each feel that truth in a different way, but we feel it nonetheless.The DVD is fine. The extras are skimpy but fine.

The film is about two men who fall in love quite by accident in the summer of 1963 while they are tending sheep on Brokeback Mountain.All of the characters in the film are baffled by this ""thing"" that has happened to them because it did happen to them even if they were nowhere around when Ennis Del Mar and Jack Twist first fell in love.  Heath Ledger, who plays Ennis is excellent.  Ennis allows his fear of what this love means if anyone finds out, to color the way he walks, talks, and ages.  In spite of the fear though, Ennis finds a way to be with Jack, even if it is for only once or twice a year.  Jake Gyllenhaal's performance as Jack Twist is haunting as Jack tries to persuade Ennis that they should give up their marriages, buy a ranch together, and live the ""good life"".  Michelle Williams, as Alma, Ennis' wife, steals a scene as Alma witnesses an embrace between Ennis and Jack that she knows is going to deprive her of the life with Ennis that she craves.  Anne Hathaway, who plays Lureen, Jack's wife, portrays in a telephone scene how Lureen has sunk into a bleached-blonde cold shell of her former self.Ang Lee orchestrated this ""thing"" that happened to these people beautifully.  The passion between these two men that spans twenty years is as sweeping as the landscapes.  The audience members are left with craving such a passion in their lives if they've never had it; if they have, they are left with wanting to foster and protect it if it's still there or to cherish and seek it again if it isn't.",5,Love Is Love,1145577600,"04 21, 2006",2006,1621,"['Ang', 'Lee', 'Brokeback', 'Mountain', 'masterpiece', 'long', 'movie', 'film', 'two', 'men', 'who', 'fall', 'love', 'quite', 'accident', 'summer', '1963', 'are', 'tending', 'sheep', 'Brokeback', 'Mountain.All', 'characters', 'film', 'are', 'baffled', 'thing', 'happened', 'did', 'happen', 'even', 'were', 'nowhere', 'around', 'when', 'Ennis', 'Del', 'Mar', 'Jack', 'Twist', 'first', 'fell', 'love', 'Heath', 'Ledger', 'who', 'Ennis', 'excellent', 'Ennis', 'fear', 'what', 'love', 'anyone', 'out', 'color', 'way', 'talks', 'ages', 'spite', 'fear', 'Ennis', 'way', 'be', 'Jack', 'even', 'only', 'once', 'twice', 'year', 'Jake', 'Gyllenhaal', 'performance', 'Jack', 'Twist', 'haunting', 'Jack', 'persuade', 'Ennis', 'should', 'give', 'up', 'marriages', 'buy', 'ranch', 'together', 'live', 'good', 'life', 'Michelle', 'Williams', 'Alma', 'Ennis', 'wife', 'scene', 'Alma', 'embrace', 'Ennis', 'Jack', 'going', 'deprive', 'her', 'life', 'Ennis', 'Anne', 'Hathaway', 'who', 'Lureen', 'Jack', 'wife', 'telephone', 'scene', 'how', 'Lureen', 'sunk', 'bleached-blonde', 'cold', 'shell', 'former', 'self.Ang', 'Lee', 'orchestrated', 'thing', 'happened', 'people', 'beautifully', 'passion', 'two', 'men', 'spans', 'twenty', 'years', 'as', 'sweeping', 'landscapes', 'audience', 'members', 'are', 'left', 'craving', 'passion', 'lives', ""'ve"", 'never', 'had', 'have', 'are', 'left', 'wanting', 'foster', 'protect', 'still', 'cherish', 'seek', 'again', ""n't""]",N/A

Their romance continues over the years, hidden they believe, from those around them.I read the 65-page version of this originally 11-page short story by Annie Proulx way back, and found it an enjoyable read. When I heard they were bringing it to the big screen, I wasn't particularly enthusiastic, as it seemed to me a hard one to script and bring the emotions and thoughts of the lead characters to light. I suppose my preconceptions may have spoiled the experience for me somewhat.It's a great story, and the screen adaptation is about as good as it can be. Both Gyllenhaal and Ledger do an outstanding job in their roles as Jack and Ennis (Gyllenhaal hasn't gotten the credit he deserves for this, in my opinion), and their supporting cast, particularly Williams as Alma, Ennis' wife, do an extraordinary job of showing that not only Jack and Ennis are suffering from their predicament. All said, the film comes across as just a bit too long, and at times a bit boring. By the end, I was a bit eager to see the credits roll.I won't demean what this film has done in bringing gay issues to the fore, particularly in the more Southerly States. While the subject matter of gay ""cowboys"" (these were sheep) is supposed to be daring, it's all a few years too late. Proulx's work, at the time it was written, DID, indeed, break new ground.

The first thing that grabbed my attention, was the sheer brilliance in cinematography.  The landscape and surroundings of Brokeback Mountain is extremely detailed and rich in colour.  The relationship between the two leads becomes stronger and stronger as the the film goes on.  Until the both sleep in a tent together and instinctively embrace.  The story continues with their relationship as they both turn seperate ways and try to live their lives, resisting the urge to be together.  Their relationship is obviously complicated as they can't be seen together in public, and the only way they can see each other is Brokeback Mountain.Their are terrific performances by Heath Ledger and Jake Gylenhall (spelt wrong, I know), as they struggle with their lives.  Although their is some fantastic acting, it is the story and the way it was told that let it down for me.  The story wasn't as powerful and as emotional as I had expected.  Their are also a few uncomfortable scenes dealing with domestic violence that are brilliantly acted out.Overall, this was an OK film, and a film that everyone would enjoy.P.S.

During the early part of it, I thought it a bit slow and began to wonder if it wasn't past my bedtime. At the same time however, I thought the cinematography was stunning; making me wish I was in a proper cinema (as opposed to seeing it on my 20"" screen).Gradually I opened up to the story and the way it was presented, and lo and behold, by the end of the film I felt it worthy of the praise it has received. And in retrospect, I believe that it HAD to be revealed just as it was, in that somewhat plodding cowboy style. Kind of made me think of ""A Prairie Home Companion""'s characters Dusty & Lefty from *The Lives of the Cowboys* (couldn't help myself; if you're a PHC listener, you'll know what I mean).Sometimes I was frustrated by the behavior of the two lead characters, but that doesn't diminish the quality of the movie. For example, I wanted to suggest (before their subsequent marriages), that Jack & Ennis just DITCH that cowboy life and head for San Francisco or NYC or some other place more congenial to their relationship. But alas, there were other things to be considered as well; not the least of which would be the backgrounds and limited education (and hence opportunity) for these two, especially Ennis with his taciturn manner.But my point is that in mulling over the possibilities, I took the characters of Jack & Ennis very seriously, as they were very convincingly portrayed by Gyllenhaal and Ledger. I forgot that Heath Ledger was Australian; he had that mumbly mealy-mouthed American cowboy bit down pat. And Ang Lee's direction turned my early-on yawns into rapt attention. Now I would like to watch the movie a second time (at least); something I seldom do. Please bear this in mind if you're tempted to give up on ""Brokeback Mountain"" halfway through, because you're ""bored"". By the way, the basis for this movie is a short story written for ""The New Yorker"" by Annie Proulx.Also I'd just like to mention that if a gay man in the U.S. West had limited opportunities in 1963, it seemed to me that women (gay OR straight) had even LESS to choose from (sigh).

172499,A2VE83MZF98ITY,1417030321,"FrKurt Messick ""FrKurt Messick""","[21, 34]","I recall a short story version of Brokeback Mountain many years ago in a major periodical (alas, I can't recall the periodical). I had an idea that it would, in the fullness of time, become a major motion picture, and that it has. It is an award-winning film already, and looks set for some sort of Oscar recognition.  The film has garnered more Oscar nominations than any other this year.However, in the hype surrounding the film, those interested would be wise to look at the book. There is much more depth here than in the film, much more about the interior workings of the main characters and what they must endure. This is ultimately not a love story, as the marketing has been spinning the film, but rather an expose on the dangers and drawbacks of living in the closet. For the purposes of this story, Annie Proulx has juxtaposed two diametrically opposite cultures in the American psyche - the gay culture and the cowboy culture (although history is, as it often is, in fact rather different from what the Hollywood-created current remembrance of it is). One comes to wonder at the resistance that all characters seem to have for breaking free of their bonds; ultimately, none of the relationships are satisfying, and there is an emotional desolation as wide and spare as brush land and prairies of the American West.The lead characters meet while working for the summer as wranglers and watchers over herds. They form a bond that renews at regular intervals during their lives, lives that go on to other, more traditional and socially acceptable settings. Each gets married, each has children, each embarks (in one way or another) in a working life that would seem to preclude the other, but yet the tie that binds them draws them together again on a regular basis.The closet theme is heightened in the lead characters, but in fact serves as a metaphor for readers who might not fit in that particular closet - we all have skeletons in our closets, it seems, and in fact, we all have our own closets in which we hide and live out part of our lives.This theme is played in out in several scenes of the film - Ennis Del Mar finding his shirt intertwined with Jack's shirt in Jack's closet, which Ennis then proceeds to put into his own closet.The last scene is perhaps the most powerful of all, drifting to a final image.  Ennis' daughter, having announced her marriage plans, drives off into the dusty plain; Ennis is living in isolation in his own trailer which has next to no furniture (his daughter comments that he needs a chair); and the very final shot is of a closet door, kept closed until Ennis is alone, with a view of the mountains in the far distance just outside the window beyond.In terms of overall cinematography, this is a beautiful film.  Ang Lee's direction has provided wonderful panoramic views of the mountains and the plains, the not-so-wild west of America, mid-century.  This is a world very different from either coast - the trends of the cities in New England and California have little effect on life here, which goes on generation after generation with an unrelenting sameness.Jack Twist (Jake Gyllenhaal, fresh from his role as a marine in 'Jarhead') and Heath Ledger (whose film 'Casanova', playing at the same time in the same cinema in my town, cast him in a very different role) play the leads of Jack Twist and Ennis del Mar, two down-on-their-luck wranglers who get a summer job camping out with sheep herds in the mountains - the kind of 24 hour/7 day-per-week job that virtually nobody wants.  Jack is the extrovert, whereas to call Ennis an introvert might win the Oscar for understatement.  At one point, Jack points this out, after a conversation that only lasted for about a minute.Jack Twist: 'That's more words than you've spoke in the past two weeks.'Ennis Del Mar: 'Hell, that's the most I've spoke in a year.'Ledger's portrayal of Ennis is remarkable in that Ennis seems to be almost inarticulate.  Everything is said in a grumble, a low-level, low-syllable-count manner.  Gyllenhaal's portrayal of Jack as the ants-in-his-pants, high-energy bronco buster cowboy is also very enthralling.  Jack's passion for many things comes through, and through the film we come to discover (as Ennis comes to discover) that this passion comes with a high price.Anne Hathaway and Michelle Williams play the wives of Jack and Ennis, respectively.  Both want 'regular' lives, and both discover there is more to their husbands' relationship than fishing-buddy friendship in different ways.  In some ways, the film reminded me of another film, 'Same Time Next Year', in which a couple gets together on a regular basis while maintaining stable, family relationships elsewhere.  However, there is a price to be paid for leading such double lives, and we see this manifested in different ways in the lives of Ennis, Jack, and their wives and children.  Again, the issue of the closet comes into play.Of course, the big 'issue' for the film is homosexuality and homophobia.  That this takes place within the almost-sacred genre of the American Western also adds to the heightened interest - the mythology of the American cowboy being a super-macho figure has already been developed as a gay stereotype by such groups as the Village People and what sociologists might call costume-culture communities.  The unspoken secret that rarely made even a mention on Hollywood screens was that cowboys, being isolated much of the time, and in male-only communities when they did have company, almost certainly had a higher incidence of same-sex expression than we have come to believe through the mythology.Ennis and Jack do put physical and emotional expression to their passion and to their love for each other, but societal expectations and personal feelings (what some term internalised homophobia) work to keep them apart and leading separate (and dual) lives throughout the twenty-year span of the film.There is no happy ending to this film - I left the cinema with a feeling about as desolate as the dry and dusty plains shown in many of the scenes.  I found bits of the music score coming back to me for days afterwards, and each time this happened, I would feel a bit more sombre, and a little bit lost for words.  The original themes by Gustavo Santaolalla and Marcelo Zarvos are very well done, and this is a soundtrack I mean to get.I won't predict that it will win the best picture Oscar, but I am not surprised it is one of the odds-on favourites for winning.",5,A mountaintop experience,1140134400,"02 17, 2006",2006,6496,"['recall', 'short', 'story', 'version', 'Brokeback', 'Mountain', 'many', 'years',

172501,ACIBQ6BQ6AWEV,1417030321,"Gary F. Taylor ""GFT""","[30, 35]","BROKEBACK MOUNTAIN has been described as ""a gay love story.""  It is true that the story concerns an on-going relationship between two men, but this is merely the pebble director Ang Lee throws into the pond; the film itself is about the ripples the stone makes, and by examining them in meticulous fashion BROKEBACK creates a portrait of the way human beings are distorted by both external and self-imposed repression.  It is a powerful film, an artful film.  It is also one of the most painful films I have seen, the sort of film from which you emerge with a stunned sensation, and a film that lingers in your mind for a very long time afterward.In terms of plot the movie begins simply enough.  Two ranch hands, Ennis (Heath Ledger) and Jack (Jake Gyllenhaal), are hired to tend sheep on Brokeback Mountain in the summer of 1963.  Ennis is a very self-contained man.  Jack is more outgoing and is presented, in a relatively subtle way, as a man who is open to sexual possibilities.  As the summer progresses they become friends, and as Ennis opens up emotionally the two suddenly begin a sexual relationship.  Although they are careful to tell each other that they are not gay, and although the words ""I love you"" never cross their lips, the relationship develops into a romantic one.  But all summers must end.  The two men, struggling with emotions they are ""not supposed to have"" for each other, leave the mountain and each other.  Both men marry; both have children; both go on with their lives.But the stone makes ripples in the pond.  Ennis, more so than Jack, is utterly unable to accept the idea that he is homosexual--and yet when Jack seeks him out several years later it is Ennis who leaps at Jack both sexually and emotionally, and what began as a seemingly transient affair rapidly develops into an overpowering relationship that they must conceal from wives, children, and society--and the consequences of concealment are devastating for all concerned.  This is particularly true of Ennis, who has few internal resources, who is more afraid of social retribution, and who can neither let go of Jack nor bring himself to agree that they can live discreetly together.  The result is a series of internal tragedies, failures, losses, and frustrations, all of which create a deep and abiding pain from which there is no escape.In terms of art, the film is beautifully crafted.  Director Ang Lee approaches his material with a sparse grace and an eye for the telling detail, presenting the characters in such a manner as to allow you see them in the fullest possible way.  He is greatly assisted in this by the remarkably powerful script by Larry McMurty and Diana Ossana, which translates Annie Proulx's memorable short story to the screen in both brilliant recreation and illumination, and by Rodrigo Prieto's simple yet compelling cinematography.  The cast is fine beyond all possible expectation, never sounding a false note, and we believe them from start to finish.  Nothing is either overplayed or underplayed; there is no artificially heightened drama; no manufactured element any kind.  Indeed, with the single exception of an occasional make-up effect, it is virtually impossible to fault the film on any level.  Is it a great masterpiece?  I think it may well be.  Time will tell.The film has been controversial on several fronts, but most particularly for the homosexual relationship that forms the spine of the plot.  Some critics have seen this as evidence of ""Hollywood's leftist agenda;"" others have stated that the film is the best possible argument for same sex marriage.  To adopt these attitudes, however, is to impose ideas on BROKEBACK MOUNTAIN that do not actually exist in the film.  It is a rare example of a film that does not tell you what to think; it simply presents a story of what things were like, and in some respects are still like, for gay men and their families in America.  It leaves you to make your own judgement about right, wrong, and where sympathy should reside.In closing, I will make an cautionary observation: while I strongly recommend the film, I must note that BROKEBACK MOUNTAIN will likely take a toll on many gay viewers akin to the toll taken by PLATOON on Vietnam vets.  I think this will be particularly true of gay men from largely rural and small town backgrounds and who are presently in their forties or older.  It is profoundly painful to see elements of your life undergo this sort of extremely public autopsy, and had I realized the accuracy of the film I might well have elected to wait for a release to the home market.  Having said this, I also note that in a visual sense BROKEBACK MOUNTAIN really requires the breadth of a movie screen, and I do recommend that it be seen in that format if at all possible.GFT, Amazon Reviewer",5,Quietly Devastating,1138665600,"01 31, 2006",2006,4804,"['BROKEBACK', 'MOUNTAIN', 'been', 'described', 'gay', 'love', 'story', 'true', 'story', 'concerns', 'on-going', 'relationship', 'two', 'men', 'merely', 'pebble', 'director', 'Ang', 'Lee', 'pond', 'film', 'ripples', 'stone', 'examining', 'meticulous', 'fashion', 'BROKEBACK', 'portrait', 'way', 'human', 'beings', 'are', 'distorted', 'external', 'self-imposed', 'repression', 'powerful', 'film', 'artful', 'film', 'also', 'one', 'most', 'painful', 'films', 'have', 'seen', 'sort', 'film', 'emerge', 'stunned', 'sensation', 'film', 'mind', 'very', 'long', 'time', 'afterward.In', 'terms', 'plot', 'movie', 'simply', 'enough', 'Two', 'ranch', 'hands', 'Ennis', 'Heath', 'Ledger', 'Jack', 'Jake', 'Gyllenhaal', 'are', 'hired', 'tend', 'sheep', 'Brokeback', 'Mountain', 'summer', '1963', 'Ennis', 'very', 'self-contained', 'man', 'Jack', 'more', 'outgoing', 'presented', 'relatively', 'subtle', 'way', 'man', 'who', 'open', 'sexual', 'possibilities', 'summer', 'become', 'friends', 'Ennis', 'up', 'emotionally', 'two', 'suddenly', 'begin', 'sexual', 'relationship', 'are', 'careful', 'tell', 'other', 'are', 'not', 'gay', 'words', 'love', 'never', 'cross', 'lips', 'relationship', 'romantic', 'one', 'summers', 'must', 'end', 'two', 'men', 'struggling', 'emotions', 'are', 'not', 'supposed', 'have', 'other', 'leave', 'mountain', 'other', 'men', 'marry', 'have', 'children', 'go', 'lives.But', 'stone', 'ripples', 'pond', 'Ennis', 'more', 'so', 'Jack', 'utterly', 'unable', 'accept', 'idea', 'homosexual', 'yet', 'when', 'Jack', 'out', 'several', 'years', 'later', 'Ennis', 'who', 'leaps', 'Jack', 'sexually', 'emotionally', 'what', 'began', 'seemingly', 'transient', 'affair', 'rapidly', 'overpowering', 'relationship', 'must', 'conceal', 'wives', 'children', 'society', 'consequences', 'concealment', 'are', 'devastating', 'concerned', 'particularly', 'true', 'Ennis', 'who', 'few', 'internal', 'resources', 'who', 'more', 'afraid', 'social', 'retribution', 'who', 'can', 'neither', 'let', 'go', 'Jack', 'bring', 'agree', 'can', 'live', 'discreetly', 'together', 'result', 'series', 'internal', 'tragedies', 'failures', 'losses', 'frustrations', 'create', 'deep', 'abiding', 'pain', 'escape.In', 'terms', 'art', 'film', 'beautifully', 'crafted', 'Director', 'Ang', 'Lee', 'material', 'sparse', 'grace', 'eye', 'telling', 'detail', 'presenting', 'characters', 'such', 'manner', 'allow', 'see', 'fullest', 'possible', 'way', 'greatly', 'assisted', 'remarkably', 'powerful', 'script', 'Larry', 'McMurty', 'Diana', 'Ossana', 'Annie', 'Proulx', 'memorable', 'short', 'story', 'screen', 'brilliant', 'recreation', 'illumination', 'Rodrigo', 'Prieto', 'simple', 'yet', 'compelling', 'cinematography', 'cast', 'fine', 'possible', 'expectation', 'never', 'sounding', 'false', 'note', 'believe', 'start', 'finish', 'Nothing', 'overplayed', 'underplayed', 'artificially', 'heightened', 'drama', 'manufactured', 'element', 'kind', 'Indeed', 'single', 'exception', 'occasional', 'make-up', 'effect', 'virtually', 'impossible', 'fault', 'film', 'level', 'great', 'masterpiece', 'think', 'may', 'well', 'be', 'Time', 'will', 'tell.The', 'film', 'been', 'controversial', 'several', 'fronts', 'most', 'particularly', 'homosexual', 'relationship', 'spine', 'plot', 'critics', 'have', 'seen', 'evidence', 'Hollywood', 'leftist', 'agenda', 'others', 'have', 'stated', 'film', 'best', 'possible', 'argument', 'same', 'sex', 'marriage', 'adopt', 'attitudes', 'however', 'impose', 'ideas', 'BROKEBACK', 'MOUNTAIN', 'do', 'not', 'actually', 'exist', 'film', 'rare', 'example', 'film', 'not', 'tell', 'what', 'think', 'simply', 'story', 'what', 'things', 'were', 'respects', 'are', 'still', 'gay', 'men', 'families', 'America', 'make', 'own', 'judgement', 'right', 'wrong', 'where', 'sympathy', 'should', 'reside.In', 'closing', 'will', 'make', 'cautionary', 'observation', 'strongly', 'recommend', 'film', 'must', 'note', 'BROKEBACK', 'MOUNTAIN', 'will', 'likely', 'take', 'toll', 'many', 'gay', 'viewers', 'akin', 'toll', 'taken', 'PLATOON', 'Vietnam', 'vets', 'think', 'will', 'be', 'particularly', 'true', 'gay', 'men', 'largely', 'rural', 'small', 'town', 'backgrounds', 'who', 'are', 'presently', 'forties', 'older', 'profoundly', 'painful', 'see', 'elements', 'life', 'sort', 'extremely', 'public', 'autopsy', 'had', 'realized', 'accuracy', 'film', 'might', 'well', 'have', 'elected', 'wait', 'release', 'home', 'market', 'Having', 'said', 'also', 'note', 'visual', 'sense', 'BROKEBACK', 'MOUNTAIN', 'really', 'breadth', 'movie', 'screen', 'do', 'recommend', 'be', 'seen', 'format', 'possible.GFT', 'Amazon', 'Reviewer']",N/A

It recently came to the forefront when I saw a stack of DVDs in my local warehouse club. I was tempted to buy, but didn't. But the sight prompted this review. This has to be one of the best movies I've ever seen. Absolutely stunning.""Brokeback Mountain"" is a tragic love story, and it's tragic on every scale. It was set largely in rustic and scenic Wyoming (actually, Alberta) and it unfolded as two young men met as employees of a local rancher. Their task was to care for a herd of sheep on Brokeback Mountain over the summer months. They gradually became friends and then ""special friends."" At the end of the summer, they parted and went on with their lives including getting married and raising families. The experience of Brokeback Mountain, however, proved too strong and they gradually started getting back together again, and again. The result was an aching love story and a growing tragedy for the men, their families and all concerned. The story riveted my attention and was painful to watch. My girlfriend and I left the theater and we couldn't talk. We were both choked up by the emotional impact. We discussed it for the next several months, however. The movie was that powerful.Everyone associated with this film should get an award of some kind. The director gently reached out and grabbed hold of the audiences' attention. He then allowed the tragic story to unfold amid a spendid scenic backdrop and accompanied by wonderful music. In watching it, you feel as if you're a part of the story, or at least a fly on the wall. This film is amazing and very powerful. View it, by all means. If the subject matter bothers you, don't buy and complain.

There isn't enough hype and hooplah about it!!!!! Get it more publicity and out of the ""closet"" so everyone can enjoy it. Fantastic scenery, excellent casting, wonderful soundtrack, and a storyline as beautiful as it is controversial makes Brokeback Mountain a classic before its time. Ang Lee did it again. The story is about deep love and devotion (who cares if it is between 2 men?) and how no obstacle can stand in the way of it. You soon forget that the two people in love are same sex and concentrate on the aspect that even though forbidden, they manage to endure obstacles that prevent them from being together permanently from living in different states, loveless marriages, nagging in-laws, money, and the fear of being ""found out.""

I sat there in tears as the credits rolled by wanting to see more and hoping it would have ended happily. The last film I cried in was ""The Notebook,"" another credit to everlasting love. Yes, men do cry at films; there is nothing wrong with that. I say if you can cry at a film, then the director made his point and the actors earned their keep. The love scenes between the two men were very tastefully done and not shock value for the sake of selling tickets -- it again reiterated the story line of pent up emotions that finally erupted and were long overdue. Heath and Jake were perfectly matched in their roles. I was so moved I bought the soundtrack, the book, and am waiting for the DVD to be released to ad to my collection.

172505,A3BWP965RIWBCU,1417030321,"Gerald Parker ""Gerald Parker""","[0, 2]","I saw ""Brokeback Mountain"" in the theatre, here in the Abitibi (of Qu&eacute;bec) when it first came out. The film repulsed me and I found it very distasteful. Then I read the novella on which it is based and found that much more sympathetic and, actually, quite touching.Comparing notes with a friend, who is also gay, it seems that some of the dialogue that was so cynically misogynistic in French lacks that acerbically anti-women character in the original English dialogue of the film, so a reconsideration is due. Why the French dubbing, at least as heard with the film here in Qu&eacute;bec, added so much gratuitously anti-female bias to the film is hard to comprehend. I am not very sympathetic to feminism, but there are limits to how much a film ought to insult the female of the human species!Although it goes beyond what Annie Proulx' novella and the film recount (but intertwining those two sources), the full-length novel presently available on the WWW (and hopefully to appear in book form), ""Brokeback Mountain: the Novel, 1943-2006, the Births, Lives, Times, Secrets and Deaths of Ennis del Mar and Jack Twist"" (by a beefily handsome author who goes by the pseudonym ""Jet"") adds some depth to one's appreciation of the characters in the tale. The story is erotised (but not vulgarly so) beyond what there has been already, but in a convincing and vivid way that does not cheapen the tale in any way.The novel opens some episodes or other bits, some of considerable potential interest to many viewers, which were excised during the editing of the film, which may be what most highly interests fans of the motion picture, at least until a truly comprehensive ""director's cut"" edition of the film, including these passages, may happen, at last, to appear. Jet's novelisation even fills in Jack and Ennis' childhoods and their parents' stories, a really fine part of what this new novel accomplishes. Jet also carries the story forward into decades after the times of the action recounted in the original novella and in the film. Jet's new novelisation needs to be taken on its own terms, of course, but I recommend it to other readers.There is much in ""Brokeback Mountain"" to arouse interest and one's emotions. Whether the original novella or the motion picture, repeated viewings and readings do help for the tale's message to sink into one's conscious memories of it, and Jet's full-length novelisation helps that further.

172506,A15Q9YEG1XPEJN,1417030321,Get What We Give,"[26, 31]","Brokeback Mountain is a film of epic proportions! All involved in this project should be extremely proud of themselves. The film is an Ansel Adams photo come to life, yet with an emotional center that no previous ""gay"" film has ever had.Too many films have been made about young men coming out of the closet. There's almost a cookie cutter mold for creating these films. Maybe that's part of the reason that this film is so fantastic...it's not about coming out. It's about the far more realistic - not hiding, but simply controlling your feeling, burying your love and remaining ""in"" the closet. Good or bad, that is what many gay men force themselves to do. Is it bad? That's not for anyone but those men involved to determine. Is it detrimental to them and their lives? Again...For Jack and Ennis (gyllenhaal and ledger), as cowboys in the early 60's all the way through the early 80's, coming out of the closet or even hiding in full view is just not an option. It ""doesn't play"" you could say.Oh, Jack is willing to take the chance - he's the risk taker of the two, but Ennis...no. Ennis knows what awaits them if they dare openly face their ""dark"" side.So instead, for over twenty years, these two ""straight"" cowboys, each with a family of his own, meet clandestinely at the ""scene of the crime"" - at Brokeback Mountain for a week or so a couple times a year and they maintain their passionate love affair.Are they gay? Are they straight? Are they hiding? Do they really love each other? I'm not going to tell you. That would be spoiling the film for you.Suffice it to say, that no major studio, no major director, no major actors have ever tackled a film of this stature or magnitude. Oh, don't give me the crap about ""Philadelphia"". It was a cop out. Hanks and Banderas never kissed. They never related to each other. No, this film is the one that will forever be seen as the film that broke all the stereotypes that went before. It is the film that will be referred to in film history books as the one that broke down the walls.Every actor in this film is firing on every cylinder. Ledger, who up until now, I thought was a light weight pretty boy, delivers a tour de force performance. He's the quiet, yet very much NOT the introspective man. He just doesn't have much to say. He swallows his words but you can see every thought as it rolls across his face. Ledger should have the best actor performance nailed. Gyllenhaal, too, delivers a performance of amazing depth and emotional range. His anger...his desperation... his loss... towards the end of the film, is palpable. Michelle Williams (Ledger's actual wife) as Ennis' wife cannot possibly be the same actress who played Jen on Dawson's Creek. No way. This actress is masterful and mature and you certainly can feel her pain. Her face tells the whole story. Randy Quaid and Anne Hathaway also deliver absolutely phenomenal performances. This is a vehicle for some of the best performances you'll ever see on film - ever!This is the film that lets the world know that even the most masculine of men can find deep within themselves an aching need that, no matter how hard they try, cannot be suppressed by playing it straight. These two men tried against all efforts to fit the mold society set for them. But as Jack says, ""I guess ol' Brokeback really got us good."" They are bound to each other.Does it have flaws? Yes. It's overly long. Twenty minutes could have been shaved off. However, with this film I'm beginning to realize why all of Ang Lee's films seem to drag on too long. He wants to take us along the road with each of his characters to the most complete of jumping off points. He wants us to fully understand them. Is it always effective? No. However, he is the director. And his past efforts are certainly example enough of how masterful this director is. I'll grant him his extra time so long as he continues to show us the true emotional center of characters, instead of relegating an entire character's reason for being to a single line of dialogue as many American films do. Lee's films are much more realistic and allow the audience to truly connect with the characters.I'll be buying this film for certain. It warrants watching over and over (if nothing more than for figuring out what the heck some of the characters are saying from time to time).Simply awesome!",5,Emotionally charged epic with a gay centerpiece!,1134950400,"12 19, 2005",2005,4349,"['Brokeback', 'Mountain', 'film', 'epic', 'proportions', 'involved', 'project', 'should', 'be', 'extremely', 'proud', 'film', 'Ansel', 'Adams', 'photo', 'come', 'life', 'yet', 'emotional', 'center', 'previous', 'gay', 'film', 'ever', 'had.Too', 'many', 'films', 'have', 'been', 'made', 'young', 'men', 'coming', 'closet', 'almost', 'cookie', 'cutter', 'mold', 'creating', 'films', 'Maybe', 'part', 'reason', 'film', 'so', 'fantastic', 'not', 'coming', 'out', 'far', 'more', 'realistic', 'not', 'hiding', 'simply', 'controlling', 'feeling', 'burying', 'love', 'remaining', 'closet', 'Good', 'bad', 'what', 'many', 'gay', 'men', 'force', 'do', 'Is', 'bad', 'not', 'anyone', 'men', 'involved', 'determine', 'detrimental', 'lives', 'Again', 'Jack', 'Ennis', 'gyllenhaal', 'ledger', 'cowboys', 'early', '60', 'way', 'early', '80', 'coming', 'closet', 'even', 'hiding', 'full', 'view', 'just', 'not', 'option', ""n't"", 'play', 'could', 'say.Oh', 'Jack', 'willing', 'take', 'chance', 'risk', 'taker', 'two', 'Ennis', 'Ennis', 'what', 'dare', 'openly', 'face', 'dark', 'side.So', 'instead', 'twenty', 'years', 'two', 'straight', 'cowboys', 'family', 'own', 'meet', 'clandestinely', 'scene', 'crime', 'Brokeback', 'Mountain', 'week', 'so', 'couple', 'year', 'maintain', 'passionate', 'love', 'affair.Are', 'gay', 'Are', 'straight', 'Are', 'hiding', 'Do', 'really', 'love', 'other', ""'m"", 'not', 'going', 'tell', 'would', 'be', 'spoiling', 'film', 'you.Suffice', 'say', 'major', 'studio', 'major', 'director', 'major', 'actors', 'have', 'ever', 'tackled', 'film', 'stature', 'magnitude', 'Oh', 'do', ""n't"", 'give', 'crap', 'Philadelphia', 'was', 'cop', 'out', 'Hanks', 'Banderas', 'never', 'kissed', 'never', 'related', 'other', 'No', 'film', 'one', 'will', 'forever', 'be', 'seen', 'film', 'broke', 'stereotypes', 'went', 'film', 'will', 'be', 'referred', 'film', 'history', 'books', 'one', 'broke', 'walls.Every', 'actor', 'film', 'firing', 'cylinder', 'Ledger', 'who', 'now', 'thought', 'was', 'light', 'weight', 'pretty', 'boy', 'tour', 'de', 'force', 'performance', 'quiet', 'yet', 'very', 'much', 'NOT', 'introspective', 'man', 'just', ""n't"", 'have', 'much', 'say', 'words', 'can', 'see', 'thought', 'face', 'Ledger', 'should', 'have', 'best', 'actor', 'performance', 'nailed', 'Gyllenhaal', 'too', 'performance', 'amazing', 'depth', 'emotional', 'range', 'anger', 'desperation', 'loss', 'end', 'film', 'palpable', 'Michelle', 'Williams', 'Ledger', 'actual', 'wife', 'Ennis', 'wife', 'can', 'not', 'possibly', 'be', 'same', 'actress', 'who', 'played', 'Jen', 'Dawson', 'Creek', 'way', 'actress', 'masterful', 'mature', 'certainly', 'can', 'feel', 'pain', 'face', 'whole', 'story', 'Randy', 'Quaid', 'Anne', 'Hathaway', 'also', 'deliver', 'absolutely', 'phenomenal', 'performances', 'vehicle', 'best', 'performances', ""'ll"", 'ever', 'see', 'film', 'ever', 'film', 'world', 'know', 'even', 'most', 'masculine', 'men', 'can', 'find', 'deep', 'aching', 'need', 'matter', 'how', 'hard', 'try', 'can', 'not', 'be', 'suppressed', 'playing', 'straight', 'two', 'men', 'tried', 'efforts', 'fit', 'mold', 'society', 'set', 'Jack', 'guess', 'ol', 'Brokeback', 'really', 'got', 'good', 'are', 'bound', 'other.Does', 'have', 'flaws', 'Yes', 'overly', 'long', 'Twenty', 'minutes', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'shaved', 'off', 'However', 'film', ""'m"", 'beginning', 'realize', 'why', 'Ang', 'Lee', 'films', 'seem', 'drag', 'too', 'long', 'take', 'road', 'characters', 'most', 'complete', 'jumping', 'off', 'points', 'fully', 'understand', 'always', 'effective', 'No', 'However', 'director', 'past', 'efforts', 'are', 'certainly', 'example', 'enough', 'how', 'masterful', 'director', ""'ll"", 'grant', 'extra', 'time', 'so', 'long', 'show', 'true', 'emotional', 'center', 'characters', 'instead', 'relegating', 'entire', 'character', 'reason', 'being', 'single', 'line', 'dialogue', 'many', 'American', 'films', 'do', 'Lee', 'films', 'are', 'much', 'more', 'realistic', 'allow', 'audience', 'truly', 'connect', 'characters.I', ""'ll"", 'be', 'buying', 'film', 'certain', 'warrants', 'watching', 'nothing', 'more', 'figuring', 'out', 'what', 'heck', 'characters', 'are', 'saying', 'time', 'time', 'awesome']",N/A

This time the story is between two cowboys who spend time together sheep herding on Brokeback mountain in the summer of 1963 and continue their relationship for the next 20 years.  While the women in their lives suffer emotional neglect, the real angst in this movie is depicted in the moments when Jack and Ennis are spent apart.  It is said that absence makes the heart grow fonder, but Jack and Ennis feel its effects doubly so.The cinematography is absolutely stunning.  The soundtrack is quiet, simple and honest.  The actors are perfectly cast and well-depicted.  I was quite surprised by Anne Hathaway's performance.  She nails the Texas accent and the attitude of a wife whose marriage very quickly became a loveless convenience.  Additionally, our wholesome heroine from the Princess Diaries is no more after Hathaway's first topless scene with Jake Gyllenhall.  Seems like everyone is growing up in this film.Because the movie involves some very sensitve material that is not yet widely accepted by the public, I do caution to those who are uncomfortable with homosexuality that this film is not for you.  There are a few love scenes, short yet somewhat explicit, that might cause you to squirm in your seat or quite possibly gag.  Conversely, homosexuals would find this movie both sad and endearing.

Whether you're gay or straight this story will have a profound effect on many many people.  I believe a lot of people can relate to having a love so strong with another individual but due to certain times, situations, demographics, jobs or other possibly uncontrollable circumstances this love had to stay hidden.  I went and saw this movie three times at the theater and cried my eyes out each time.  Jake Gyllenhaal gave an outstanding and very emotional performance in this movie!  My heart just went out to him (Jack) and he is the reason for my tears.  Heath Ledger also gave an outstanding performance as (Ennis) who just seemed so confused about his heart and feelings.  When I first heard about the movie it was two gay cowboys.  I thought na, not interested.  Started reading reviews and it is so much more.  It makes you think of all that wasted time that could have or should have been spent with that individual.  It was about Love, Wasted Time, and watching your life pass by.  I will definitely buy the DVD when it comes out on the 28th of this month.  This is the best movie I have seen in years.

172510,A328S9RN3U5M68,1417030321,Grady Harp,"[23, 26]","E. Annie Proulx visited a cowboy bar in Wyoming and felt an underlying eroticism seething in that most macho of possible places.  That observation translated into a courageous short story in 1997, a study of love between two cowboys whose world would never condone such feelings (remember Laramie?), and so 'Brokeback Mountain' was born in New Yorker Magazine.  Now that tender and heartbreaking tale of hidden, durable, passionate love between two young men trapped in a society that will not allow such feelings has been luminously transformed in to a film: it is rewarding to see how successful that long journey became.The story is so well known that it need not be summarized beyond the brief statement that two nineteen year old young men, both with histories of abandonment, need, and pain, find physical attraction in the cold nights on Brokeback Mountain while guarding sheep, and though both assure each other that neither is gay, the love creeps out of the night physicality into the daytime sunny thrills of feeling alive and cared for. After only a couple of months, their job completed, they part ways, each marrying, having children, but over almost twenty years they periodically reconnect, understanding the depth of their forbidden love, and cope the best they can.  Divorces ensue, promises of being together permanently are thwarted by a number of reasons, and the while the story evaporates into the lonely landscape of Wyoming, the love that bonded them, a love they could never 'own', ends.Ang Lee molds this magnificently poignant love story with grace, style, realism, and bravery.  Proulx's story is made visual by Larry McMurtry and Diana Ossana's screenplay and while the script is true to the story on the whole, there is much added business about the wives and children and parents that perhaps is necessary for moviegoers to 'get it', but in this viewer's mind is less sensitive than the extended silences within the vast spaces of Wyoming that made Proulx' story so quietly and powerfully understated.  Heath Ledger is superb as Ennis Del Mar but Jake Gyllenhaal is equally as strong as Jack Twist: together they create a chemistry racked with pain as well as bliss and make their characters totally believable.  Michelle Williams does well as Ennis' long suffering wife Alma, while Anne Hathaway remains Anne Hathaway, a lady far too elegant to be convincing as the cowgirl Lurene the Jack marries in the vacuum without Ennis.But criticisms are few (the only major one is that Gyllenhaal has not been sufficiently recognized for his brilliant portrayal in Heath Ledger's shadow).  This is a beautiful film that addresses love and all its permutations and it is so refreshing to see a story of this depth and significance so quietly and tenderly placed before the theater audience.  Highly recommended.

Known beforehand as a pretty-boy Austrailian Actor, Mr. Ledger masterfully keeps Ennis Del Mar's emotions as tight as a balled-up fist as he is incapable of to show Gyllenhaal's Jack Twist the depth of his love. The final 30 minutes of this film are as wrenching and honest as anything committed to film.

172514,A3LU79BYMWZEW9,1417030321,Gregor von Kallahann,"[5, 7]","BROKEBACK MOUNTAIN has already generated enough buzz--and enough controversy--to muddle one's critical faculties for, I dunno, maybe the next five years.  And much of the commentary seems to amount to so much posturing.  From what I've been reading, the most sophisticated response (arguably) is something along the lines of ""It's pretty good.  Beautifully photographed. And very well acted.  But it's really just a love story--in cowboy drag.""  Yikes!  I'd rather listen to the gushing praise or even the indignant blanket condemnations.Not that the movie is perfect.  There were moments when I thought that it had fallen in love with its own arty sketchiness.  Short scene after short scene to be telegraphing the message: you're just getting the outlines of what you need to know and no more.  I guess I have more of a literary sensibility than a purely cinematic one.  I wanted to get to know all the characters better.  And though I understand that the movie only had a couple of hours to lay out the events of 20 years, I would have appreciated more than just a glimpse at the events of a given year, more of a sense of the flow of time.  Not just ""Oh look, the toddlers are teenagers now.  I guess we're in a new decade.""But a fluid representation of time is always hard when a story arcs over a lengthy period: doesn't matter whether the source story was a lengthy novel or, as it was in this case, a short story.  (Or for that matter, if it's from an original screen play.)  So maybe that's quibbling.  I will give them credit though: they certainly have come up with better age make-up (or is is the aging technique done digitally these days?).  Twenty-somethings Jake Gyllenhaal and Heath Ledger really do look fortyish by the end of the movie.  Only the buoyantly youthful Anne Hathaway seems not to have aged at all (only tarted up a bit by bleaching her hair).But I digress. The reason a viewer might want more from the story is because what IS there is handled so well.  This is the story of circumscribed, hardscrabble lives made all the more difficult because the characters find themselves dealing with feelings and issues that they can only begin to fathom.  They don't talk much, which is what the  Big Sky culture they were raised in seems to demand of men--and women--of the time.  But the movie gives the lie to the myth of the strong silent type.  Of course, this is years before ""Oprah-speak"" entered into the culture--and in this particular neck of the woods, that kind of ""sharing"" probably has (for good and for ill) yet to make much of a foothold.  In the case of Jack and Ennis, it would seem to be pretty much FOR ILL.  These are people who cannot risk opening those emotional floodgates.And that's not just true of the men.  On one level, this is the story of two men are struggling with their feelings for each other (in a world where such feelings are unacceptable).  But as many have noted, it is also the story of the women that they marry and the children that they father.  In fact, the one performance that I would say is close to being a shoo-in come awards time is likely Michelle Williams subtle performance as Ennis's (Heath Ledger's character)long-suffering (but not a forever suffering)wife.  Her performance has been described as heartbreaking, and it is.  But it is precisely her character's verbal inarticulateness in the face of an overwhelming realization that lends meaning to her every expression and gesture.Watching the movie, I was reminded that one of the few other things I have seen Michelle Williams in was HBO's lesbian themed IF THESE WALLS COULD TALK 2.  In one of that film's episodes, she played a proudly defiant young lesbian student in the 1970s.  That TV movie was much more schematic than BROKEBACK, but the two films, when considered together, actually do suggest something of the difference between the pre- and post-Stonewall mentality.  And of the significance of geography and social class as factors that may allow gays and lesbians options in how to lead their lives.  1970s middle class students from the East had more options than rural poor kids from the Far West had in the early 1960s.But of course, there are strong social and political forces even today who would have it otherwise.  Before the film began, I heard a man a few rows ahead of me complaining to his (female) companion that ""Born agains don't have a clue.  They say it's all about behavior.  It's about identity.""  Well, he would have little argument from me.  But life--and this film--are still even more complex than that.  I can readily imagine that if fundamentalist Christians (or Jews or Muslims) actually might be willing to view this film, they might well come to a conclusion that would only confirm their beliefs.  They might say, ""See, these men are fully capable of having a relationship with the opposite sex, of siring children, and establishing a family.  It's only out of selfish lust that they refuse to do so.  And that leads to their downfall.""That IS a possible interpretation, I suppose.  The film's more liberal target audience (myself included) would likely come up with an alternate analysis, namely that if these two people who loved each other lived in a world that accepted their difference, they never would have been forced into marriages that they did not want and could never find fulfilling.But ultimately that's not quite it either.  Good art like BROKEBACK is less about getting across a moral or socio-political message than it is about portraying life as it is lived.  That's another difference between this and, say, IF THESE WALLS COULD TALK 2.  This is less of a tract and more of a portrait of some people's lives.  And it rings true.Which is about all you can demand from a work of art.",5,Some People's Lives,1136851200,"01 10, 2006",2006,5773,"['BROKEBACK', 'MOUNTAIN', 'already', 'generated', 'enough', 'buzz',

172517,AEV640MKB3I9J,1417030321,Hank Drake,"[32, 37]","""Great books make terrible movies,"" has been a cinematic rule of thumb for generations. Commonly, the problem lies in trying to compress a lengthly novel (usually digested by the reader in small chunks) into a two hour movie--the action becomes telescoped, the motivations of the characters trite or simply incomprehensible. Less frequently, an attempt to remain faithful to the text results in a bloated monstrosity which is equally hard on the patience and the hindquarters.At 55 pages, Annie Proulx's Brokeback Mountain is ideally suited for the silver screen. The adaptation by Larry McMurtry and Diana Ossana is faithful to both the letter and the spirit of the short story--much of the dialogue is lifted from the book verbatim. The film highlights the books' contradictions: epic, yet intimate; stark, yet lush. The characters speak in their silences as much as in dialogue. This is a story that could be only set in America. Yet, it is an irony that Asian born Ang Lee has directed a definitive American masterpiece.Much will be made of Brokeback Mountain's treatment of homosexuality. But sexual orientation is not the main issue. Honesty is. None of the four main characters in Brokeback Mountain attain happiness--and it's all because of the lie. Ennis and Jack fall in love while herding sheep on Brokeback Mountain in 1963. It is chalked up to loneliness and horniness, and written off as a one time deal. Ennis marries Alma, while Jack marries Lureen. In 1967, Jack and Ennis reunite, and the lie perpetuates. Alma spots them kissing and denies what she sees. She never even mentions it to Ennis until a decade later. Ennis and Jack continue to meet sporadically over the years. Given the era and the culture, there are no options for them to live openly. By the time he's 30, Ennis has deteriorated into a virtual automaton, only fully human when he's with Jack. Ennis and Alma divorce in 1975, while Jack's marriage cools into a business partnership. Unless one is honest with oneself, and in turn honest with others, one can never be happy, and the sorrow spreads like a disease.So the great lesson of Brokeback Mountain is age old: To Thine Own Self Be True. Lies, obfuscation, and concealment poison the soul--more than any sexual act or deviation from religious doctrine.Every aspect of Brokeback Mountain is outstanding: cinematography, editing, makeup (the characters convincingly age twenty years without overdoing it), music (just enough to highlight the story). But it's the acting which will stand out.Heath Ledger's performance is masterful. He plays Ennis as a terrified loner, hiding his emotions beneath a gruff exterior, his cowboy hat shielding his eyes. Ennis is so controlled by his fear that his heart breaks just as he realizes he has one. Jack Twist is a more open hearted character than Ennis, easier to read, and because of this Jake Gyllenhaal's equally commanding performance may be overshadowed by Ledger's. But he merits recognition as well. These are both stunningly brilliant actors in full command of their resources. Michelle Williams and Anne Hathaway also deserve kudos for their strong supporting roles.Regardless of the viewer's or sexual (or political) orientation, or gender, Brokeback Mountain is the must see movie of our time. Just as 1939 is remembered as the year of Gone With the Wind, generations from now 2005 will be remembered as the year of Brokeback Mountain.",5,An American Masterpiece...,1136332800,"01 4, 2006",2006,3424,"['Great', 'books', 'make', 'terrible', 'movies', 'been', 'cinematic', 'rule', 'thumb', 'generations', 'Commonly', 'problem', 'trying', 'compress', 'lengthly', 'novel', 'usually', 'digested', 'reader', 'small', 'chunks', 'two', 'hour', 'movie', 'action', 'telescoped', 'motivations', 'characters', 'trite', 'simply', 'incomprehensible', 'Less', 'frequently', 'attempt', 'remain', 'faithful', 'text', 'results', 'bloated', 'monstrosity', 'equally', 'hard', 'patience', 'hindquarters.At', '55', 'pages', 'Annie', 'Proulx', 'Brokeback', 'Mountain', 'ideally', 'suited', 'silver', 'screen', 'adaptation', 'Larry', 'McMurtry', 'Diana', 'Ossana', 'faithful', 'letter', 'spirit', 'short', 'story', 'much', 'dialogue', 'lifted', 'book', 'verbatim', 'film', 'books', 'contradictions', 'epic', 'yet', 'intimate', 'stark', 'yet', 'lush', 'characters', 'speak', 'silences', 'as', 'much', 'dialogue', 'story', 'could', 'be', 'only', 'set', 'America', 'irony', 'Asian', 'born', 'Ang', 'Lee', 'directed', 'definitive', 'American', 'masterpiece.Much', 'will', 'be', 'made', 'Brokeback', 'Mountain', 'treatment', 'homosexuality', 'sexual', 'orientation', 'not', 'main', 'issue', 'Honesty', 'None', 'four', 'main', 'characters', 'Brokeback', 'Mountain', 'attain', 'happiness', 'lie', 'Ennis', 'Jack', 'fall', 'love', 'herding', 'sheep', 'Brokeback', 'Mountain', '1963', 'chalked', 'up', 'loneliness', 'horniness', 'written', 'off', 'one', 'time', 'deal', 'Ennis', 'marries', 'Alma', 'Jack', 'marries', 'Lureen', '1967', 'Jack', 'Ennis', 'reunite', 'lie', 'Alma', 'spots', 'kissing', 'what', 'never', 'even', 'mentions', 'Ennis', 'decade', 'later', 'Ennis', 'Jack', 'continue', 'meet', 'sporadically', 'years', 'Given', 'era', 'culture', 'are', 'options', 'live', 'openly', 'time', '30', 'Ennis', 'deteriorated', 'virtual', 'automaton', 'only', 'fully', 'human', 'when', 'Jack', 'Ennis', 'Alma', 'divorce', '1975', 'Jack', 'marriage', 'business', 'partnership', 'one', 'honest', 'turn', 'honest', 'others', 'one', 'can', 'never', 'be', 'happy', 'sorrow', 'spreads', 'disease.So', 'great', 'lesson', 'Brokeback', 'Mountain', 'age', 'old', 'Thine', 'Own', 'Self', 'Be', 'True', 'Lies', 'obfuscation', 'concealment', 'poison', 'soul', 'more', 'sexual', 'act', 'deviation', 'religious', 'doctrine.Every', 'aspect', 'Brokeback', 'Mountain', 'outstanding', 'cinematography', 'editing', 'makeup', 'characters', 'convincingly', 'age', 'twenty', 'years', 'overdoing', 'music', 'just', 'enough', 'highlight', 'story', 'acting', 'will', 'stand', 'Ledger', 'performance', 'masterful', 'Ennis', 'terrified', 'loner', 'hiding', 'emotions', 'beneath', 'gruff', 'exterior', 'cowboy', 'hat', 'shielding', 'eyes', 'Ennis', 'so', 'controlled', 'fear', 'heart', 'just', 'one', 'Jack', 'Twist', 'more', 'open', 'hearted', 'character', 'Ennis', 'easier', 'read', 'Jake', 'Gyllenhaal', 'equally', 'commanding', 'performance', 'may', 'be', 'overshadowed', 'Ledger', 'recognition', 'as', 'well', 'are', 'stunningly', 'brilliant', 'actors', 'full', 'command', 'resources', 'Michelle', 'Williams', 'Anne', 'Hathaway', 'also', 'deserve', 'kudos', 'strong', 'supporting', 'roles.Regardless', 'viewer', 'sexual', 'political', 'orientation', 'gender', 'Brokeback', 'Mountain', 'must', 'see', 'movie', 'time', 'Just', '1939', 'remembered', 'year', 'Gone', 'Wind', 'generations', 'now', '2005', 'will', 'be', 'remembered', 'year', 'Brokeback', 'Mountain']",N/A

I saw this movie because I love movies in general and will see anything that seems interesting to me.This is a beautifully shot movie with breath-taking scenery that perfectly depicts the lonely and sometimes harsh beauty of Wyoming.  The acting is good by everyone, but I agree with a previous reviewer that what was missing between the two main characters, Ennis and Jack, was the true intimacy of two people falling in love.  The desperation and sexual wanting between the two was obvious, but not the deeper love for one another.  Anyway, it was aching to see that for the next 20 years in the movie, Ennis and Jack must sneak away to Brokeback Mountain in order to be themselves, and spend the majority of their lives living a forced lie out of fear, obligation, responsibility, etc.  It made me wonder how many of us live that way - not being able to be ourselves.This is definitely not a ""feel-good"" movie, so if that's what you're in the mood for, you should see something else.

Corbin ""Foster Corbin""","[26, 35]","At long last after one of the longest and best orchestrated promotions, ""Brokeback Mountain"" opened on a limited showing, which I believe translates into art houses in large cities. Even in Atlanta, Georgia it is now playing in one midtown theatre in a neighborhood where there are more rainbow flags visible than flannel shirts.The film is beautiful to watch if a bit too long. That is to be expected since Mr. Lee had the task of fleshing out a short story into a two hour movie. It is easier to express passage of time with two sentences than on the big screen with two characters who essentially are nonverbal, a second problem as the director had to show a lot of what was going on between the two lead actors with only body language and facial expressions. Additionally, in the short story by Annie Proulx that Mr. Lee and Larry McMurtry and Diana Ossana based this movie on the men are not particularly attractive. For instance, in the Proulx account Jack Twist has buckteeth; there ain't nothing buckteeth about Jake Gyllenhaal's smile. He is almost too handsome although he does put on weight as the years pass by.These are minor complaints, however. The movie should not be missed, not only by gay audiences but by the rest of America as well. Both lead actors do a fine job as do the minor characters, particularly Jack Twist's wife. The message is clear: in 1963 in Wyoming-- as in the rest of America-- two masculine ""Malboro"" men could not have had an open relationship. If they had been hairdressers and town outcasts, maybe. On the other hand, love in whatever form it takes is not to be missed. Isn't that what living is all about anyway?While Mr. Lee, who by the way, is one of our best and most innovative directors-- he never repeats himself-- deviates some from Proulx's story, he keeps the essence of it. In the very end of the movie he adds a poignant touch by having Ennis hang his shirt outside Jack's on the same hanger in his closet, something, as I recall, he does not do in the story.The soundtrack is worth listening to as well, particularly Willie Nelson's version of ""He Was A Friend of Mine.""We can only hope that the movie gets to a wide audience in Wal-Mart and K-Mart land, where these two men and their families lived.",5,"But Will It Play In Falls Church, Virginia?",1134864000,"12 18, 2005",2005,2255,"['long', 'last', 'one', 'longest', 'best', 'orchestrated', 'promotions', 'Brokeback', 'Mountain', 'opened', 'limited', 'showing', 'believe', 'art', 'houses', 'large', 'cities', 'Even', 'Atlanta', 'Georgia', 'now', 'playing', 'one', 'midtown', 'theatre', 'neighborhood', 'where', 'are', 'more', 'rainbow', 'flags', 'visible', 'flannel', 'shirts.The', 'film', 'beautiful', 'watch', 'bit', 'too', 'long', 'be', 'expected', 'Mr.', 'Lee', 'had', 'task', 'fleshing', 'out', 'short', 'story', 'two', 'hour', 'movie', 'easier', 'express', 'passage', 'time', 'two', 'sentences', 'big', 'screen', 'two', 'characters', 'who', 'essentially', 'are', 'nonverbal', 'second', 'problem', 'director', 'had', 'show', 'lot', 'what', 'was', 'going', 'two', 'lead', 'actors', 'only', 'body', 'language', 'facial', 'expressions', 'Additionally', 'short', 'story', 'Annie', 'Proulx', 'Mr.', 'Lee', 'Larry', 'McMurtry', 'Diana', 'Ossana', 'based', 'movie', 'men', 'are', 'not', 'particularly', 'attractive', 'instance', 'Proulx', 'account', 'Jack', 'Twist', 'buckteeth', 'ai', ""n't"", 'nothing', 'buckteeth', 'Jake', 'Gyllenhaal', 'smile', 'almost', 'too', 'handsome', 'put', 'weight', 'years', 'pass', 'by.These', 'are', 'minor', 'complaints', 'however', 'movie', 'should', 'not', 'be', 'missed', 'not', 'only', 'gay', 'audiences', 'rest', 'America', 'well', 'lead', 'actors', 'do', 'fine', 'job', 'do', 'minor', 'characters', 'particularly', 'Jack', 'Twist', 'wife', 'message', 'clear', '1963', 'Wyoming', 'rest', 'America', 'two', 'masculine', 'Malboro', 'men', 'could', 'not', 'have', 'had', 'open', 'relationship', 'had', 'been', 'hairdressers', 'town', 'outcasts', 'maybe', 'other', 'hand', 'love', 'form', 'not', 'be', 'missed', ""n't"", 'what', 'living', 'anyway', 'Mr.', 'Lee', 'who', 'way', 'one', 'best', 'most', 'innovative', 'directors', 'never', 'Proulx', 'story', 'essence', 'very', 'end', 'movie', 'poignant', 'touch', 'having', 'Ennis', 'hang', 'shirt', 'Jack', 'same', 'hanger', 'closet', 'something', 'recall', 'not', 'do', 'story.The', 'soundtrack', 'worth', 'listening', 'as', 'well', 'particularly', 'Willie', 'Nelson', 'version', 'Was', 'A', 'Friend', 'Mine', 'can', 'only', 'hope', 'movie', 'wide', 'audience', 'Wal-Mart', 'K-Mart', 'land', 'where', 'two', 'men', 'families', 'lived']",N/A

172523,A364VIQ3KLAWVX,1417030321,H. M Pyles,"[14, 31]","It has been remarked that too many directors approach movies as filmed plays instead of as a primarily visual art, and they consequently over-rely on dialogue.  Ang Lee certainly addresses that criticism, virtually turning silence and taciturn gazes to the purpose usually served by dialogue.This movie tells (or rather paints) a compelling story of two young men who, by unexpectedly falling in love one summer in a remote mountain shepharding camp, suddenly find that their assumed paths in life will carry them farther and farther away from the path to which their natures call them.  One -- Jack Twiss -- is willing to find his way onto the right path, if he can just convince his lover, Ennis Del Mar, to join him.  Ennis, perhaps more appalled than Jack at what he finds himself to be -- and more fearful, due to a traumatic childhood experience -- refuses to become Jack's fellow traveller.  So they both settle into a years-long pattern of interludes stolen from their wives and families, with each tryst ending as yet another missed opportunity heaped on a growing pile of quiet despair.  And the despair is not their's alone, as in different ways it grows to encompass their families and destroy the lives they thought would be their screen and their distraction, if not their salvation, from their illicit love.It's a bleak story, painted bleakly.  Jack lives his straight life against the backdrop of a garish suburban house kept by a wife who never saw a hairdo she could resist.  Ennis lives his straight life in a dingy hovel over a laundromat, with a wife who, though deserving of his love and sympathy, is forcefed his own emotional deprivation.  The horizon only clears and the scenery only beguiles in the mountains to which Jack and Ennis escape for their sparse doses of love.It's a fine movie, beautifully crafted.  But I take one star away for the very reason that most critics laud it to the heavens:  the use by Heath Ledger of gazes, glowers, and distant stares in lieu of not just some, but almost all, dialogue.  I have a dog who manages to express herself reasonably well with looks and body language.  I know when she's hungry, frustrated, and about to pee on something.  But I really would know so much more about her if she could just say a few words every now and then.  (Please don't take this as a slam against Ledger's acting ability.  He's awfully good at gazes, glowers, and stares.  This is a director's choice, not an actor's.)This over-reliance on non-verbal expression created two flat spots in what would otherwise have been a 5-star movie for me.  The first was the scene in the tent when Jack and Ennis first made love.  Granted, it was supposed to have been spontaneous.  But few things -- especially the acquiescence of two adults in suddenly breaking through their deeply-rooted taboos -- are quite as spontaneous as here portrayed.  There had to be more going on by way of prelude than just the rollicking and wrestling in the grass and the excuses to spend the night at base camp . . . and dialogue might have held the clue to that missing something.The second was the tragic ending of the movie.  By that time, Ennis had withdrawn into such taciturnity that one can only observe his loss as an event, not feel it as the tearing out of his heart and soul that is presumably was.  A few well-scripted words would have helped rather than hindered the carrying of a dramatic load that was, in my opinion, simply too heavy for a few caught breaths and baleful strokings of empty clothes -- no matter how masterfully delivered.Well, enough of my verbosity.  I'm off to practice pinching my jaw expressively for the next movie review.",4,Say Something . . . Anything . . . Just Talk . . .

172527,A5ZJFVV0564T6,1417030321,"Ilona Novotny ""Eccentric""","[15, 16]","""Brokeback Mountain"", scripted by Larry McMurtry (""Lonesome Dove"") and Diana Ossana from E. Annie Proulx's short story, and directed by Ang Lee (""Sense and Sensibility""), has a lot of people talking.  The tale of two cowboys, the taciturn Ennis Del Mar (Heath Ledger) and rodeo cowboy Jack Twist (Jake Gyllenhaal) who fall in love while working on Brokeback Mountain in Wyoming in 1963, has just won several major Golden Globe Awards, has been banned in the State of Utah, and has people, straight and gay, talking...and thinking...a lot.When I first heard of the film's subject, I said ""Oh, not another film about gay people that ends in tragedy, haven't we progressed beyond that?"" Well, after seeing the film, I have to say ""Yes.....and no."" I, a gay man born in the mid-1950s in New York City, feel very fortunate to have not been a gay man in Riverton, Wyoming in 1963, tho I can still remember being ""fag baited"" in my teens, and was even physically attacked in the early 1980s, for ""being queer."" I, fortunately, survived. A lot of people who were born after the 1970s cannot imagine what it must have been like for gay people, especially for those who were not living in major cities, back in the 1960s and 1970s.Since I won't go too much into the film's storyline, what I will say what I admired was how the subject was handled. Since the story begins in Wyoming in 1963, where there was no such thing as an openly gay man, one has to place oneself in that time and place.  Men didn't show ""tenderness"" towards another man, because ""Real men don't do such things, unless they're queer"", and ""Real"" men got married and raised families. Women were expected to marry, have children, and look after their homes. Homosexuality was a subject that was whispered about, or derided as a sign of sexual perversion, or weakness, or mental illness. Period. ""Brokeback Mountain"" does not eroticize, nor sensationalize, nor exploit the activity between the two men. There is one (count it, one) scene, shot in semi-darkness, when ""the urge"" overtakes the two men and they begin to have ""rough"" sex (remember, ""real"" men have to be rough in Wyoming!), and that's that. No nudity, no revelling, it's over in seconds. Those expecting steamy ""Queer as Folk"" sex scenes will be disappointed, it's not to be found here. Keep reading.The acting in the film is, well, I forgot that I was watching actors! There is no grandstanding here, no showy histrionics. Heath Ledger's Ennis is so believable, I didn't know he is Australian! No goofy cowboy twang here. Jake Gyllenhaal's Jack is sensitive but not whiney, and Michelle William's Alma Del Mar and Anne Hathaway's  Lureen Twist are no brain-dead bimbos, they are women who married their men for love, and then must deal with the realization of their husbands' ""other life"" in the best way they can. Michelle Williams' ""suffer in silence"" performance, until she can longer be silent, and Anne Hathaway's Lureen, who remains tight-lipped and stoic, are believable, subtle performances. There are no villains and heroes in this tale, no devils or angels, just people. This is a true-to-life tragedy, where everyone suffers a loss. A loss of innocence, a loss of dreams.Visually, the film is a study in contrasts. The ""bigness"" and beauty of Brokeback Mountain, and the cramped, claustrohobic, often ugly, ""real world"" (dismal apartments, trailers, saloons) are an obvious leitmotif. Rodrigo Prieto's unglossy cinematography, very sharp, has its own stark beauty, and Gustavo Santaolalla's decidedly spare score, add to the simple and sensitive way this story is told. Director Ang Lee, I understand, did not ""fuss"" at his actors., nor does the film ""preach"" or fall into kitschy sentimentality, it walks a very fine line and does not falter. It takes a slightly detached (but not dispassionate) point of view, it depicts its situations and characters simply and directly, they ""are what they are"". The story plays itself, and the important theme that seems to be the crux of this film, is that people make decisions in life, be they good or bad, right or wrong, and what follows is.....? No one goes through life without heartbreak, it's unavoidable. We all make mistakes, we all make compromises, we all have regrets, we're only human. After being clobbered, bludgeoned, and oversaturated  with unbelievable scenarios, non-stop editing, deafening musical scores, endless special effects, this film is a welcome (altho some people may not like this, as it gives them time to think!) change for filmgoers. I was drawn into the story by the simple and beautiful imagery, the remarkably believable performances, the all-too-believable situations, and yes, I wept. I wept for everyone in the film. Here it is, 2 days after I've seen the film, and it's still on my mind.

Two ranch hands, Ennis Del Mar (a very sexy and rugged Heath Ledger) and Jack Twist (a remarkably vulnerable Jake Gyllenhaal) are looking for work when they get a gig as sheepherders on Brokeback Mountain.Ennis and Jack share hardworking days and lonely freezing nights, but most importantly, they both share a secret passion for each other that on one bitterly cold night reveals itself. They continue their summer working hard during the day and making love at night until one day Summer comes to an end and they go their separate ways.Four years later, they get connected again. Both are now married with children. Jack lives in Texas while Ennis remains in Wyoming. They are still in love and their yearning for each other is undeniable. However, their love affair is a burden as much as it is a bliss on both of them. They want to live out their love openly but societal laws forbidden it. They resort to frequent trysts but emotional needs cannot take it. They're between a rock a hard place and their only solace is their deep commitment and intense love for each other.The story of their love and how it unfolds is the story of the film, which is an absolute triumph for everyone involved in making it.I am very pleased, to say the least, to see two rugged, naturally masculine men romantically connected to each other in a major motion picture. Ennis and Jack's love story transcends gender and anatomy. It truly is a remarkable (and daring) achievement in American cinema!Ang Lee (Couching Tiger, Hidden Drago, director) did an outstanding job conveying the subtle yearning these two men had for each other. Of course, he had two very capable actors to deliver his vision, but yet it was his vision that really made this film a masterpiece. The performances were great, especially that of Heath Ledger, whom I believe should win an Academy Award for his role as Ennis. He stroke that precarious balance between detached and engulfed like no one ever could or ever will. A marvelous talent (and sexy looks to boot!)Brokeback Mountain, in my opinion, is a must-see for all. It's an R-rated film, so no kids allowed! This is a movie for everyone that's ever been in love with someone that for whatever reason couldn't have. It's also for everyone that knows or would like to know what true love truly is.Definitely one of the Best Films of 2005!",5,An American Triumph,1134864000,"12 18, 2005",2005,2386,"['Summer', '1963', 'rural', 'Wyoming', 'Two', 'ranch', 'hands', 'Ennis', 'Del', 'Mar', 'very', 'sexy', 'rugged', 'Heath', 'Ledger', 'Jack', 'Twist', 'remarkably', 'vulnerable', 'Jake', 'Gyllenhaal', 'are', 'looking', 'work', 'when', 'get', 'gig', 'sheepherders', 'Brokeback', 'Mountain.Ennis', 'Jack', 'share', 'hardworking', 'days', 'lonely', 'freezing', 'nights', 'most', 'importantly', 'share', 'secret', 'passion', 'other', 'one', 'bitterly', 'cold', 'night', 'reveals', 'continue', 'summer', 'working', 'hard', 'day', 'making', 'love', 'night', 'one', 'day', 'Summer', 'end', 'go', 'separate', 'ways.Four', 'years', 'later', 'get', 'connected', 'again', 'are', 'now', 'married', 'children', 'Jack', 'Texas', 'Ennis', 'Wyoming', 'are', 'still', 'love', 'yearning', 'other', 'undeniable', 'However', 'love', 'affair', 'burden', 'as', 'much', 'bliss', 'want', 'live', 'out', 'love', 'openly', 'societal', 'laws', 'forbidden', 'resort', 'frequent', 'trysts', 'emotional', 'needs', 'can', 'not', 'take', ""'re"", 'rock', 'hard', 'place', 'only', 'solace', 'deep', 'commitment', 'intense', 'love', 'other.The', 'story', 'love', 'how', 'story', 'film', 'absolute', 'triumph', 'everyone', 'involved', 'making', 'it.I', 'am', 'very', 'pleased', 'say', 'least', 'see', 'two', 'rugged', 'naturally', 'masculine', 'men', 'romantically', 'connected', 'other', 'major', 'motion', 'picture', 'Ennis', 'Jack', 'love', 'story', 'transcends', 'gender', 'anatomy', 'truly', 'remarkable', 'daring', 'achievement', 'American', 'cinema', 'Ang', 'Lee', 'Couching', 'Tiger', 'Hidden', 'Drago', 'director', 'did', 'outstanding', 'job', 'conveying', 'subtle', 'yearning', 'two', 'men', 'had', 'other', 'course', 'had', 'two', 'very', 'capable', 'actors', 'deliver', 'vision', 'yet', 'was', 'vision', 'really', 'made', 'film', 'masterpiece', 'performances', 'were', 'great', 'especially', 'Heath', 'Ledger', 'whom', 'believe', 'should', 'win', 'Academy', 'Award', 'role', 'Ennis', 'stroke', 'precarious', 'balance', 'detached', 'engulfed', 'one', 'ever', 'could', 'ever', 'will', 'marvelous', 'talent', 'sexy', 'boot', 'Brokeback', 'Mountain', 'opinion', 'must-see', 'R-rated', 'film', 'kids', 'allowed', 'movie', 'everyone', 'ever', 'been', 'love', 'someone', 'reason', 'could', ""n't"", 'have', 'also', 'everyone', 'would', 'like', 'know', 'what', 'true', 'love', 'truly', 'is.Definitely', 'one', 'Best', 'Films', '2005']",N/A
172530,A34M2BSL7CXEHT,1417030321,"I. Sondel ""I. Sondel - lover of the arts""","[2, 4]","""Brokeback Mountain"" finally arrived in Tallahassee on January 6.  Was it worth the wait?  Yes, it was.  The film, an adaptation of a story by Annie Proulx, is a thing of beauty.  Exceptionally faithful to the source material, Ang Lee, director or of the gay comedy ""The Wedding Banquet"" (among many other notable films), has fashioned a classic love story - one I feel sure will endure.  Why am I so confident?  Because rather than being groundbreaking, I found the story to be a simple variation on the classic formula which has fate conspiring against a pair of lovers.Is it really groundbreaking in 2006 for a film to depict the passionate love between two men?  The Fundamentalists are acting like this is our first time at the rodeo.  The truth is that we've been seeing films as explicit as this one for three decades.  In 1971 (thirty-five years ago!) staright actors Peter Finch and Murray Head played a passionate love scene in ""Sunday, Bloody Sunday.""  1982 saw Harry Hamlin and Michael Ontkean lock lips in ""Making Love.""  In 1985 Manuel Puig's ""Kiss of the Spider Woman"" was nominated for a Best Picture Oscar, and William Hurt won Best Actor as the film's openly gay protagonist.  In 1987 we saw the landmark Merchant/Ivory adaptation of E. M. Forster's ""Maurice,"" a love story that featured not only a happy ending, but James Wilby and Rupert Graves in a simulated sex scene which included full frontal nudity.  Has the Radical Right forgotten about the love scenes and nudity in ""Love! Valor! Compassion!,"" ""Angels in America,"" ""Wilde"" or the deservedly controversial ""Priest""?Over the past three decades there has been a virtual explosion of films dealing with gay people: ""Torch Song Trilogy,"" ""My Beautiful Launderette,"" ""Prick Up Your ears,"" ""Longtime Companion,"" ""Philadelphia"" (for which Tom Hanks won the Best Actor Oscar), ""Gods and Monsters,"" ""Jeffrey,"" ""High Art,"" ""Boys Don't Cry"" (for which Hilary Swank won the Best Actress Oscar), ""Before Night Falls,"" ""Far From Heaven,"" ""The Laramie Project,"" ""Capote,"" ""Breakfast on Pluto,"" ""Mysterious Skin"" and ""Transamerica,"" to name but a few.  Other gay inclusive Best Picture Oscar nominees have included: ""Midnight Cowboy"" (which won the award in 1969), ""Cabaret,"" ""Dog Day Afternoon,"" ""The Crying Game,"" ""Four Weddings and a Funeral,"" ""The Full Monty"" and ""The Hours.""There's an old show business adage that says ""any publicity is good publicity.""  Perhaps films like ""Brokeback Mountain"" would never achieve ""must see"" status without the Radical Right calling special attention to them, without which they would simply come and go with little or no fanfare.  Though I can't figure out why ""Brokeback Mountain"" should be considered either controversial or groundbreaking, I highly recommend it, and would love to see it win this year's Oscar for Best Picture.

172531,A3LWHTGUFOLH6C,1417030321,Jack L. Aiello,"[53, 59]","Well, it's the day after the Academy Awards and while I'll never begrudge Crash for winning Best Picture, especially since it was a very good film, it was Brokeback Mountain that truly spoke to me and resonated in a way that Crash didn't.Adapted from the short story by E. Annie Proulx, Brokeback Mountain tells the gut wrenching story of two young ranch hands who fall in love in the early 1960s.  Ang Lee maps out their relationship up to the early 80s and actors Heath Ledger and Jack Gyllenhaal who play Ennis Del Mar and Jack Twist respectively, create fully formed characters each conflicted with demons, and each making different choices with equally devastating consequences.Debate around this movie swirls around the fact that it carries the ""sinister"" liberal agenda to finally demarginalize the gay lifestyle and bring it to the mainstream.  Brokeback Mountain, if you really look at it, is a statement about how you decide to live your life in the face of social strictures.  And it provides no uplifting answer.  If you try to live your life without apology like Jack, you run the risk of physical harm and if you choose to bottle it up like Ennis, you implode from the weight of your own longing.  And the film isn't just about Jack and Ennis, but how their relationship causes a ripple effect throughout the other people in their lives.Frankly, Brokeback Mountain is a movie whose time has come and it saddens me that Hollywood didn't fully capitalize on the zeitgeist by bestowing the film its best picture prize.  Even in the face of the Academy's snub, Brokeback Mountain still tells its powerful story.  It's beautifully shot, unfurls  very slowly but surely to its hearbreaking end and slightly optimistic coda.  Ultimately, by the end, the viewer will understand the cost of what it takes to be oneself in spite of the world, and sometimes in spite of oneself.",5,Brokeback Leaves You Brokenhearted,1141603200,"03 6, 2006",2006,1881,"['Well', 'day', 'Academy', 'Awards', ""'ll"", 'never', 'begrudge', 'Crash', 'winning', 'Best', 'Picture', 'especially', 'was', 'very', 'good', 'film', 'was', 'Brokeback', 'Mountain', 'truly', 'spoke', 'resonated', 'way', 'Crash', ""didn't.Adapted"", 'short', 'story', 'E.', 'Annie', 'Proulx', 'Brokeback', 'Mountain', 'gut', 'wrenching', 'story', 'two', 'young', 'ranch', 'hands', 'who', 'fall', 'love', 'early', '1960s', 'Ang', 'Lee', 'out', 'relationship', 'early', '80s', 'actors', 'Heath', 'Ledger', 'Jack', 'Gyllenhaal', 'who', 'play', 'Ennis', 'Del', 'Mar', 'Jack', 'Twist', 'respectively', 'create', 'fully', 'formed', 'characters', 'conflicted', 'demons', 'making', 'different', 'choices', 'equally', 'devastating', 'consequences.Debate', 'movie', 'fact', 'sinister', 'liberal', 'agenda', 'finally', 'demarginalize', 'gay', 'lifestyle', 'bring', 'mainstream', 'Brokeback', 'Mountain', 'really', 'look', 'statement', 'how', 'decide', 'live', 'life', 'face', 'social', 'strictures', 'uplifting', 'answer', 'try', 'live', 'life', 'apology', 'Jack', 'run', 'risk', 'physical', 'harm', 'choose', 'bottle', 'up', 'Ennis', 'implode', 'weight', 'own', 'longing', 'film', ""n't"", 'just', 'Jack', 'Ennis', 'how', 'relationship', 'ripple', 'effect', 'other', 'people', 'lives.Frankly', 'Brokeback', 'Mountain', 'movie', 'time', 'come', 'Hollywood', 'did', ""n't"", 'fully', 'capitalize', 'zeitgeist', 'bestowing', 'film', 'best', 'picture', 'prize', 'Even', 'face', 'Academy', 'snub', 'Brokeback', 'Mountain', 'still', 'powerful', 'story', 'beautifully', 'shot', 'unfurls', 'very', 'slowly', 'surely', 'hearbreaking', 'end', 'slightly', 'optimistic', 'coda', 'Ultimately', 'end', 'viewer', 'will', 'understand', 'cost', 'what', 'be', 'spite', 'world', 'sometimes', 'spite', 'oneself']",N/A

Imagine 1968 with Kennedy in the White House and his brother running for the election with Martin Luther King as vice-president. Ang Lee decides to show this phenomenal frustration by caressing us in teh wrong place and the wrong way, by breathing some freezing air in our neck. Two virile cowboys, who look after sheep mind you, fall in love in the solitude of these high mountains in Wyoming. What can happen ? The whole world crashes down into illusions and appearances, false sentiments that are nothing but a thin veil hiding, as well as possible, the depth that is totally forbidden and repressed and frustrated and negated lest the guardians of morality and normality decide to clean up that plate of the trash such feelings represent in their apocalyptically square vision. And the tragedy swells and waxes and explodes. Unhappiness is the result and men and women see their souls buried as deep as hell into the egostic selfishness of running after the sole satisfaction of material needs that bring no spiritual satisfaction, no pleasure of the mind, no dream of the soul, just a fattening accumulation of cholesterol and depthless enjoyment of evanescent virtual images on a TV screen. And the films finds its closure in death, death of one of those partners, and total alcoholic oblivion for the other one who satisfies himself with a tumbler of whisky to celebrate the coming wedding of one of his daughters.

There's no need to recount the plot line; it's by now almost as well known as that from the other great love story of the season, King Kong.  There's also no need to rave about Ang Lee's talent or taste; that was clear well before Brokeback ever came along.  But here's three things I can say:  first, this is not a gay movie.  It is a memorable, life-long, and very sad love story of two people who just happen to both be boys and then men.  Second, appreciation for Heath Ledger's work in portraying Ennis, the more conflicted of the two, only grows when one leaves the theater.  In every move he makes on screen, he gets the personal cost to Ennis of living with what cannot be -- as he says at one point -- ""fixed"" exactly right.  Even Jack, with his own conflicts, does not understand that cost, but thanks to Ledger's acting, the audience can.  Third, in a movie filled with affecting scenes, I'm not sure there is a more powerful one than the last, when Ennis folds up the left-behind sweater of his daughter, the other great love of his life and the consolation for not having made his life with Jack, and places it on his closet shelf near their bloodied, twinned shirts from the summer on Brokeback Mountain.",5,All It's Cracked Up to Be and More,1134864000,"12 18, 2005",2005,1239,"['What', 'left', 'say', 'need', 'recount', 'plot', 'line', 'now', 'almost', 'as', 'well', 'known', 'other', 'great', 'love', 'story', 'season', 'King', 'Kong', 'also', 'need', 'rave', 'Ang', 'Lee', 'talent', 'taste', 'was', 'clear', 'well', 'Brokeback', 'ever', 'came', 'along', 'here', 'three', 'things', 'can', 'say', 'first', 'not', 'gay', 'movie', 'memorable', 'life-long', 'very', 'sad', 'love', 'story', 'two', 'people', 'who', 'just', 'happen', 'be', 'boys', 'then', 'men', 'Second', 'appreciation', 'Heath', 'Ledger', 'work', 'portraying', 'Ennis', 'more', 'conflicted', 'two', 'only', 'when', 'one', 'theater', 'move', 'screen', 'personal', 'cost', 'Ennis', 'living', 'what', 'can', 'not', 'be', 'one', 'point', 'fixed', 'exactly', 'right', 'Even', 'Jack', 'own', 'conflicts', 'not', 'understand', 'cost', 'thanks', 'Ledger', 'acting', 'audience', 'can', 'Third', 'movie', 'filled', 'affecting', 'scenes', ""'m"", 'not', 'sure', 'more', 'powerful', 'one', 'last', 'when', 'Ennis', 'up', 'left-behind', 'sweater', 'daughter', 'other', 'great', 'love', 'life', 'consolation', 'not', 'having', 'made', 'life', 'Jack', 'places', 'closet', 'shelf', 'bloodied', 'twinned', 'shirts', 'summer', 'Brokeback', 'Mountain']",N/A

Brokeback challenges the very nature of a western romantic film, and although it is not a typical love story it will be upheld as a landmark film for both the GLBT community as well as American cinema.Brokeback is the story of two men who fall in love while herding sheep in the fictional wilderness of Brokeback Mountain. At first, I was a little skeptical that the movie was going to be good at all since the relationship between the two men develops rapidly just within the first half of the film. However, the story is much more than just about the two men. The movie explores the societal pressures of marriage and heterosexuality as both men marry women and have children. The movie also acknowledges the fear and anxiety of same sex intimacy as the character played by Heath Ledger (Ennis) is afraid of committing to a relationship because of a past childhood experience when he saw a murdered man who was suspected of being gay.SPOILER: Although the movie is quite beautiful, it is also an incredibly sad film. The character played by Jake Gyllenhaal (Jack) is murdered at the end of the film. Ennis is left to deal with his emotions of loss as well as never committing to a fulfilling relationship with Jack. Secondly, you feel incredibly sorry for the wives and the children as they become aware of their father's infidelity that end up destroying their families. Heath Ledger's recent death adds an extra sting at the end of the film.If the content of two men falling in love is of no interest to you, the incredibly beautiful scenery and soundtrack are worth it alone. I would advise ignoring the homophobic comments and reviews left by the Christian right who have no appreciation for art and progression. Approach this film with an open mind, and you will not be disappointed. Leave the prejudices at the door, sit back, and enjoy the show!

I didn't even know the proper name of this film. I kept calling it ""Broken Mountain"".This story begins in Signal, Wyoming 1963.  Ennis (Heath Ledger) and Jack (Jake Gyllenhaal) meet each other as the only two men that show up for a sheep-herding job. The two work on Brokeback Mountain together herding sheep from point A to point B. As two weeks go by, they share their life about each other and how they came to this point in their life. A friendship develops and becomes somewhat deeper.The job ends in August because of a storm. Jack mentions he might come back next summer.Ennis gets married in November to Alma. Because of work, their personal lives and living in different states, Jack and Ennis could not travel to see each other then.Ennis is getting frustrated by his wife and two kids. After four years, Ennis receives a postcard from Jack. He is driving all the way down to see Ennis. When they meet up, it's an emotional one. They hug tightly and kiss each other.For Ennis, he has been alone most of his life. He keeps himself inside, however Jack was able to open him and Ennis not happy with his married life, really missed Jack. Ennis didn't let those feelings out until he saw Jack again. Jack needs him too.Can this special friendship continue dispite the changes in their personal lives? Jack tries very hard.The Cinematography is beautiful and well done. The Original Score heart-tugging. Heath Ledger and Jake Gyllenhaal did incredible acting with Ledger's character having pinned up emotions so raw.Heath Ledger and his co-star Michelle Williams met on the set of ""Brokeback Mountain"" and became engaged in real-life. Jake Gyllenhaal is godfather to their daughter. (Heath and Michelle separated in 2007.

Option of subtitles: English, Spanish, French.SPOILER:I really hated the ending act of this film. It was almost a break-through film, but just as it's about to give you an emotional pay-off, it cuts you cold.Why is Hollywood so afraid of making a male friendship movie with a happy ending?A very diffucult film for both actors to do, but they both gave outstanding performances.Update: Heath Ledger died January 22, 2008, from an accidental overdose Acute intoxication, combined effects of painkillers, sleeping pills, anti-anxiety medication and other prescription drugs. He was 28. Heath had said he was not sleeping well, 2 or 3 hours only, because he was distraught about his role as the ""Joker"" in the new Batman movie, THE DARK KNIGHT (2008). He had a hard time getting out of the character. he also was separated from Michelle Williams and missed his daughter.His housekeeper found him naked laying face down at the foot of his bed. She came in to tell him his masseur had arrived.He will be missed! Rest in peace, Heath.While The Dark Knight (2008) was already completed, he was filming The Imagination of Doctor Parnassus (2009).

I bought the book and the screenplay and cannot keep from reading both over and over and will buy the DVD the minute it comes out.  This movie has gotten under my skin and I find myself walking around grieving for these two men and their lost love and suffering.  I believe Heath Ledger did a magnificent job, but I think Jake Gyllenhal (sp?) did just as fine a job as Jack,  a personality so different from Ennis. I could feel their love and desperation and when they first see each other again after four years, I thought I would almost faint from the emotional upheaval of it all.  I think of Jack's comment, ""Sometimes I miss you so bad I can hardly stand it."" and I could feel what he was saying when he said it.  Anyone who has ever deeply loved, whether it be a lover or a child,  and been separated from that deep love for any period of time knows what kind of true heart pain you feel.  And this movie is about deep deep love which cannot be fully expressed at the time.  It doesn't matter who they are, except that these characters are so fully drawn and presented that you know them --- it's the fact that their love is so present on the screen that you feel it piercing your heart.  I'm not even sure why I am so drawn to this book and movie (I am a hetero female - married with children, etc.), except that it is so much about deep love and it is rare to see anything these days except for those flighty little ""chick flicks"" that are cute but meaningless.  This is anything but meaningless.  When my husband and I walked into the movie, a woman walking out said, ""Good Luck.  I hope you have a lot of kleenex.""  But I was numb when I walked out.  I was just completely overcome, even though I had read the book first and knew what it was and what was coming.  I had fallen in love with Ennis and Jack and just wanted to take care of them and ease their pain.  (Of course it didn't hurt that they are both gorgeous...)

This is the unexpected story of lonely people in search of a special dream. What is not expected is that they are American cowboys and are gay. Touching off a firestorm of controversy, this film is the first of what many believe will be the next barrier in the long history of prejudicial cinema. Years ago, Europeans ventured into this forbidden niche and established a precedent which up until now, American film companies have been reluctant to address. With the incredible talents of Heath Ledger as Ennis Del Mar and Jake Gyllenhaal as Jack Twist the US has not only responded and shattered conventional wisdom, but offers perhaps the finest film of it's genre. Brokeback mountain is a story of two men searching for companionship and love. Unexpectedly thrown together by their search for employment, the two reluctantly accept ranching duties in the high Alpine mountains of Montana. There amid a vast wilderness, tending sheep and reflecting on their dreary lives, Ennis and Jack accept their solitude and quickly learn they are drawn to each other. Never-the-less, their conventional world defies, tugs and tears at their burgeoning affection for one another. Both men feel passionately, yet realize their forbidden affair could easily rip apart their facade of masculinity. Eventually, over a period of twenty years, they learn to deal with friends, families, and social pressures as their secret begins to evaporate. Emotionally charged and deeply touching in every respect, the film presents audiences with a portrait of fading Americana, amid changing seasons. All in all, a courageous attempt to mirror the life and loves of a reclusive aspect of the American cowboy. ****",5,A Mountain of Memories,1144368000,"04 7, 2006",2006,1829,"[""n't"", 'unusual', 'see', 'film', 'surpass', 'what', 'viewers', 'expect', 'Truth', 'be', 'told', 'audiences', 'enjoy', 'Such', 'case', 'Brokeback', 'Mountain', 'unexpected', 'story', 'lonely', 'people', 'search', 'special', 'dream', 'What', 'not', 'expected', 'are', 'American', 'cowboys', 'are', 'gay', 'Touching', 'off', 'firestorm', 'controversy', 'film', 'first', 'what', 'many', 'believe', 'will', 'be', 'next', 'barrier', 'long', 'history', 'prejudicial', 'cinema', 'Years', 'ago', 'Europeans', 'ventured', 'forbidden', 'niche', 'established', 'precedent', 'up', 'now', 'American', 'film', 'companies', 'have', 'been', 'reluctant', 'address', 'incredible', 'talents', 'Heath', 'Ledger', 'Ennis', 'Del', 'Mar', 'Jake', 'Gyllenhaal', 'Jack', 'Twist', 'US', 'not', 'only', 'responded', 'shattered', 'conventional', 'wisdom', 'perhaps', 'finest', 'film', 'genre', 'Brokeback', 'mountain', 'story', 'two', 'men', 'searching', 'companionship', 'love', 'Unexpectedly', 'together', 'search', 'employment', 'two', 'reluctantly', 'ranching', 'duties', 'high', 'Alpine', 'mountains', 'Montana', 'vast', 'wilderness', 'tending', 'sheep', 'reflecting', 'dreary', 'lives', 'Ennis', 'Jack', 'accept', 'solitude', 'quickly', 'learn', 'are', 'drawn', 'other', 'Never-the-less', 'conventional', 'world', 'defies', 'tugs', 'tears', 'burgeoning', 'affection', 'one', 'men', 'feel', 'passionately', 'yet', 'realize', 'forbidden', 'affair', 'could', 'easily', 'rip', 'apart', 'facade', 'masculinity', 'Eventually', 'period', 'twenty', 'years', 'learn', 'deal', 'friends', 'families', 'social', 'pressures', 'secret', 'begins', 'evaporate', 'Emotionally', 'charged', 'deeply', 'touching', 'respect', 'film', 'presents', 'audiences', 'portrait', 'fading', 'Americana', 'changing', 'seasons', 'courageous', 'attempt', 'mirror', 'life', 'loves', 'reclusive', 'aspect', 'American', 'cowboy', '****']",N/A
172544,A3KDWC5TDFQDZ0,1417030321,Jau Chwen Chan,"[33, 41]","I think the world has to thank Ang Lee for making this masterpiece and for being brave enough to pick up a script that was being dubbed as ""that gay cowboy movie"".The movie, as I'm sure many have heard numerous times, is a wonderful version of the Annie Proulx short story and really does capture the essence of it and in some parts, extends the story a little bit more.The story of Jack and Ennis (and we cannot forget their unfortunate wives) is one that I can imagine rings true in a lot of closeted gay men.  Today's society is still fairly intolerant and homosexuals are often misunderstood, stereotyped and judged just because of their sexual preference.  Living in Malaysia (where this movie was banned), it is even more apparent how underground being gay is.Beautfully made with sweeping cinematography (Ang Lee style) of Wyoming country, this movie is touching, heartbreaking and delicately made.  Through the amazing performances by all the actors, especially Heath Ledger and Jake Gyllenhaal, the sensitivity of the subjects is subtley dealt with.  Some people I know have criticised the movie for being too slow and too contrived, but in my honest opinion, the pace of the movie was necessary to stir up emotions.  As for the movie being contrived, it is not the fault of the story that it makes people feel something.All in all, highly recommended and should be viewed in full without any pre-judgement before opinions can be made.",5,Mindblowing,1147046400,"05 8, 2006",2006,1444,"['think', 'world', 'thank', 'Ang', 'Lee', 'making', 'masterpiece', 'being', 'brave', 'enough', 'pick', 'up', 'script', 'was', 'being', 'dubbed', 'gay', 'cowboy', 'movie', '.The', 'movie', ""'m"", 'sure', 'many', 'have', 'heard', 'numerous', 'times', 'wonderful', 'version', 'Annie', 'Proulx', 'short', 'story', 'really', 'capture', 'essence', 'parts', 'story', 'little', 'bit', 'more.The', 'story', 'Jack', 'Ennis', 'can', 'not', 'forget', 'unfortunate', 'wives', 'one', 'can', 'imagine', 'rings', 'true', 'lot', 'closeted', 'gay', 'men', 'Today', 'society', 'still', 'fairly', 'intolerant', 'homosexuals', 'are', 'often', 'misunderstood', 'stereotyped', 'judged', 'just', 'sexual', 'preference', 'Living', 'Malaysia', 'where', 'movie', 'was', 'banned', 'even', 'more', 'apparent', 'how', 'underground', 'being', 'gay', 'is.Beautfully', 'made', 'sweeping', 'cinematography', 'Ang', 'Lee', 'style', 'Wyoming', 'country', 'movie', 'touching', 'heartbreaking', 'delicately', 'made', 'amazing', 'performances', 'actors', 'especially', 'Heath', 'Ledger', 'Jake', 'Gyllenhaal', 'sensitivity', 'subjects', 'subtley', 'dealt', 'people', 'know', 'have', 'criticised', 'movie', 'being', 'too', 'slow', 'too', 'contrived', 'honest', 'opinion', 'pace', 'movie', 'was', 'necessary', 'stir', 'up', 'emotions', 'movie', 'being', 'contrived', 'not', 'fault', 'story', 'people', 'feel', 'something.All', 'highly', 'recommended', 'should', 'be', 'viewed', 'full', 'pre-judgement', 'opinions', 'can', 'be', 'made']",N/A

172547,A17CP110C6E9KF,1417030321,"JBizzle ""Da Fizzle Shizzle, Dizzle""","[1, 25]","As far as ""David Holt Preaus ""A2xistguy"" (Atlanta, Georgia)"" is concerned, dude, you should read someones review before you bash them and call them a bigot.  Had you actually read this review or the one I'd previously written that mysteriously disapeared, you'd know that I'm not a bigot at all, anything but a bigot, I'm seeing through all the typical Hollywood stereotypes found in this movie, if everyone else did the same, there would be no such thing as ""Brokeback Mountain"".  I repect your opinion, to bad you can't respect mine.  Now that we're done with that, this movie sucks I only gave it 5 stars so you might actually read my review rather than ignore it.  This is my second review, because my first differed a little from popular opinion (not obscene or belittling, just not ""5 stars"", ""Best Movie Ever!!"")was magically erased...hooray for freedom of speech.  First off, why would anyone care what a straight asian man knows about gay cowboys, do you really think he knows what he's talking about?  Now let me start out by saying that I'm very open minded, I'm a straight, liberal, married man, I have many friends that are gay, and I think the gay public deserve all the same rights as any other race, religion, or creed.  Homosexual's are people just like anyone else, and whether they choose(I don't believe it's a choice)to be gay or not they are people who deserve to live a normal life just the same as you and me.  Now, let's get back to the movie, Brokeback Mountain is the most god awful disrespectful film, I think I've ever seen, but not for the reasons you might think. Ang Lee once again get's everything absolutely wrong(How you gonna make ""The Hulk"" into a drama?)and doesn't get one thing right.  The only people enjoying this film are people who've never or would ever have or had anything to do with a homosexual.  The homosexual public especially should be outraged by this film.  The film has such an unrealistic premise, it makes it to silly to even try to believe in these characters.  As far as this being a great love story, give me a break, if this were a story about a man and a woman no one would care but because it's involving a gay couple suddenly it's ""The Greatest Love Story Of All Time!!!""  Give me a break, these men ignore their children and cheat on their wives, this is not a touching story.  Now you'll say ""but this took place during a time where people couldn't be open about who they were"".  Well whatever, I could still care less.  As far as the romance is concerned, if you like drunken sodomy(that's how all homosexual relationships start right), you'll love this movie.  Just one night in a tent next to a guy who's given you no prior hints that he might be gay, you(Of course not being gay yourself) roll over in the middle of the night and accidentally, violently, & analy rape each other.  That's where homosexual relationships come from according to Ang Lee.  It doesn't come from genuine love or sharing feelings with your partner, no just's Drunk BFing; and that's not offensive is it?  This movie was made by homophobes for homophobes period.  Besides this being as offensive as it is, it's extreeeemmmeeeellyy ssssslllllloooooowwwwwwww, and under Lee's direction gives you no reason to sit through the movie other than ""does this movie get better?"" questioning in your head.  Ya, maybe there is some nice pictures of the mountains, but is that really any reason to sit through this god awfully  offensively slow snooze-a-thon?  This movie is pure hype designed for me and you to sit and talk about how either good or bad it is so that around Oscar time it'll win it's awards.  2 years from now you won't hear a thing about it, and I hope to god it doesn't win any awards, that'll only cement the fact that the Oscars are even more meaningless(Gladiator was good but c'mon?)than I had already thought.  Everything about this movie is one big joke, there's not a thing special about the acting here(what, because Heathe Ledger can mumble he deserves an Oscar?).  If you truely want to watch a film about a love story that's truely award worthy watch ""Walk The Line"".  That's how true love should be visualised on film, ""BBM"" is just garbage.Ha! Ha! Ha!  Heath, Jake & Co. sure looked to be in low spirits at the end of Oscar night.  I can just hear what musta' been going through their heads ""You mean I did that movie for nothing?""  Ha! Ha!

It certainly doesn't run in the traditional ""it all works out in the end"" mill of Hollywood films. What you take away from it depends largely on your personal views. If the thought of two men loving each other disgusts you, you should probably skip this one and instead choose the Unforgiven HD-DVD to get your cowboy fix.  The film follows the story of two young men, Ennis Del Mar and Jack Twist, who meet working as sheep herders on rugged Brokeback Mtn in Wyoming in 1963.  The two men quickly bond while they depend on each other to uphold their tough job responsibilities.  One drunken night Jack makes a sexual advance on Ennis and the reprocussions from that event sweep over the next two decades after the men come down off the mountain and go their separate ways.  Later they rekindle their relationship despite their seemingly heterosexual lives. Jack pushes for a more substantial relationship but Ennis' surplus repression prevents him from imagining a good life living with the person he loves, another man. While there is alot of serious subject matter at hand, director Ang Lee does a great job mixing up tension you will feel with great and sometimes subtle moments of comedy. The great story and scenery are backed up by top notch acting from all corners.The HD-DVD release is by far the best way to experience this movie.  The cinematography is a joy to watch even though you're looking at Canada mostly and not Wyoming is still is a gorgeous film.  I was blown away by the color and detail.  Frankly, it looked better on my TV than it did projected in the theatre.Sure people are going to diss this movie over and over because of the ""gay theme"".  If you are not gay but compassionate about the rights that gay people fight for all over the world in terms of acceptance and equality then you may really like this film. Yes it deals with very controversial issues; This is not Leave it to Beaver folks. Traditional ideas about sexuality are blown away. It is because of a deep repression, not the flaws of the characters, that everyone loses here. In a sense this movie mirrors a great love story like Romeo and Juliet.

172549,A140XH16IKR4B0,1417030321,Jean E. Pouliot,"[9, 28]","The story of ""Brokeback Mountain"" -- the love affair of two gay men over the course of 20 years in the American West -- had great potential. Imagine the depths of heart that could be explored by this unexpected relationship, and the frank exchanges about the lies that gay men had/have to live to survive in society. Imagine them helping each other to maintain the veneer of their cover-job marriages, and the anguish of having to pretend to love women they could only admire as sisters. Imagine too how they might share pride at the children they had fathered. Imagine too the silly little cultural references that could be made as these two unlikely lovers lived through that 1960s and disco `70s.But there was none of this. The story, as translated from E. Annie Proulx's short story, was anemic. It was often hard to know what was going on the in the characters' minds. Changes in relationship came without warning or reason. For instance, one minute, the two leads are purportedly standoffish heterosexual cowpokes; then, without benefit of a narrative or visual thread, they are madly in love. This might have been acceptable in the early stages of their relationship. But they were just as inscrutable years later. Neither was I impressed by the scenery, which I found barren and lifeless rather than ruggedly beautiful. The subtext of danger, under which gays existed in the 1960s, was largely and inexplicably absent from the film.There were wonderful performances. Heather Ledger was terrific as the taciturn Ennis Del Mar, and Kate Mara was bashful and vulnerable as his 19-year-old daughter Alma Jr..  Michelle Williams was wonderful as loyal, betrayed Ennis's wife Alma. But Jake Gyllenhaal's character Jack Twist was flat and unemotional. And knocks to the makeup department for some truly unconvincing facial hair!The haunting musical theme by Gustavo Santaolalla was a standout. I wish I could say that the rest of BBM moved me. I couldn't connect with characters who seemed to be completely disconnected from the people and times that surrounded them.

In Michael Bronski's anthology ""Taking Liberties: Gay Men on Sex, Politics...."", there is a great essay about how rooms function in gay male literature.  Since male homosexuality is stigmatized, much of it has to take place in closed, private spaces.  The author points to Baldwin's ""Giovanni's Room"" as a classic example of this.  ""Brokeback"" takes that idea and turns it on its head.  Instead of a cramped room usually in some big, anonymous metropolis, the lovers here have a huge open area as their private sanctuary.  There are no doors or walls in the film, yet they have their relative unseen special place.  I only saw Van Sant's ""My Own Private Idaho"" once.  That's the only other film that I can think of as remotely using open space as a metaphoric ""gay room.""2.  Of course, I'm obsessed with the representation of gay men of color in film.  I have an Amazon.com list called ""A Gay Minority Man Walks By.""  It lists many of the movies where a GMOC appears and then disappears just as quickly.  There's a crow who only speaks one line and who is supposed to represent a GBM in the adult cartoon ""Fritz the Cat.""  ""16 Candles""' Long Duck Dong plays a stereotypical GAM in ""Booty Call.""  ""Brokeback"" is a virtually all-white movie, even though Texas (one of its locations) has many people of color in it.  Jake G. picks up some trade in Mexico.  If you blinked, you would have missed it.  The hustler says nothing.  This potentially, and problematically, renders a man in the developing world silent.  However, if he said, ""Hey, Big Daddy, wanna good time?"", it would have been seen as equally problematic.  Plus, many prostitutional transactions may be done without words, especially in international tricking/sex tourism.",4,2 more thoughts on this film,1137628800,"01 19, 2006",2006,1735,"['1', 'Michael', 'Bronski', 'anthology', 'Taking', 'Liberties', 'Gay', 'Men', 'Sex', 'Politics', 'great', 'essay', 'how', 'rooms', 'function', 'gay', 'male', 'literature', 'male', 'homosexuality', 'stigmatized', 'much', 'take', 'place', 'closed', 'private', 'spaces', 'author', 'points', 'Baldwin', 'Giovanni', 'Room', 'classic', 'example', 'Brokeback', 'idea', 'head', 'Instead', 'cramped', 'room', 'usually', 'big', 'anonymous', 'metropolis', 'lovers', 'here', 'have', 'huge', 'open', 'area', 'private', 'sanctuary', 'are', 'doors', 'walls', 'film', 'yet', 'have', 'relative', 'unseen', 'special', 'place', 'only', 'saw', 'Van', 'Sant', 'Own', 'Private', 'Idaho', 'once', 'only', 'other', 'film', 'can', 'think', 'as', 'remotely', 'using', 'open', 'space', 'metaphoric', 'gay', 'room.', '2', 'course', ""'m"", 'obsessed', 'representation', 'gay', 'men', 'color', 'film', 'have', 'Amazon.com', 'list', 'called', 'A', 'Gay', 'Minority', 'Man', 'Walks', 'many', 'movies', 'where', 'GMOC', 'then', 'just', 'quickly', 'crow', 'who', 'only', 'one', 'line', 'who', 'supposed', 'represent', 'GBM', 'adult', 'cartoon', 'Fritz', 'Cat', '16', 'Candles', 'Long', 'Duck', 'Dong', 'stereotypical', 'GAM', 'Booty', 'Call', 'Brokeback', 'virtually', 'all-white', 'movie', 'even', 'Texas', 'one', 'locations', 'many', 'people', 'color', 'Jake', 'G.', 'up', 'trade', 'Mexico', 'blinked', 'would', 'have', 'missed', 'hustler', 'nothing', 'potentially', 'problematically', 'man', 'developing', 'world', 'silent', 'However', 'said', 'Hey', 'Big', 'Daddy', 'wan', 'na', 'good', 'time', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'seen', 'equally', 'problematic', 'many', 'prostitutional', 'transactions', 'may', 'be', 'done', 'words', 'especially', 'international', 'tricking/sex', 'tourism']",N/A
172551,A1FXPZ5K1C1NBY,1417030321,Jeff Pearlman,"[0, 1]","I'd like to think I'm more objective than many people about this movie.  Gay-oriented material doesn't offend me, yet I laughed at all the jokes made about this movie when it came out (NO PUN INTENDED!).  I bought it after the '05 Oscar noms were announced, but didn't open it for two years.  The right mood never seemed to hit me:  ""what to watch...Comedy?  Horror?  Action?  Kissing Cowboys?""  I finally watched it after I heard about Heath Ledger's tragic, accidental overdose.It's a good movie, a little slow in parts, but with some deeply moving scenes.  Unless they are seeing something I missed, reviewers who whine about naked men romping all over the place are simply lying for their own reasons.  As I recall, the only nudity in sexual situations is that of female characters; Ledger's character's buttocks (and I guess, therefore, Ledger's) are in the background of one scene--he's bathing, with Gyllenhaal's character (deliberately?) NOT looking.  The guys actually do a bit of romping (I should look that word up) in one scene and in another, jump nude into a lake, but are shown from too far a distance to either delight or disgust anyone.  I assume.Unlike some of my friends, I don't agree that ""Brokeback"" is all that ""romantic.""  Although some scenes make clear that Ennis (Ledger) and Jack (Jake Gyllenhaal) are happier and more relaxed with each other than they are anywhere else, more often they're fighting, usually over Ennis' refusal to commit to a full-time relationship.  Another reviewer smartly referenced ""Same Time, Next Year"" though in a (way) more negative way.I also have trouble seeing how anyone could consider ""romantic"" the first time Ennis and Jack...are intimate.  I didn't notice any signs of attraction between them before they suddenly had at it.  They didn't seem very happy about it all, which began abruptly (not necessarily a bad thing), but they seemed almost hostile, with no talk and a little confusion (mostly on Ennis' part).  Oh, and much grunting.  The scene, by the way, involved no nudity.  OK, so I looked away a little.  There was at most a little of the top of Gyllenhaal's buttocks.  From some of these other reviews, you'd think these guys spent two hours swinging from chandeliers.I also felt the wives' points of view were underrepresented.  It's not clear Anne Hathaway's Lureen ever figured it all out, though her sad transformation from feisty to frosty suggests she did.  Michelle Williams' Alma found out early, though she didn't confront Ennis until much later.  I found that believable because I've known couples to ignore even the biggest pink (or white, they could be white) elephants to avoid the bigger trauma of breaking up.The scene that convinced me this movie was a keeper and not a disappointment involved Jack's first visit with Ennis since THAT summer.  About four years had passed and both had married.  Ennis compulsively flicks his lighter, pathetically waiting by the window.  Alma prepares to tolerate a dull night of ranching stories over dinner somewhere.  Jack finally shows, Ennis runs out to him and kisses him like Jack was rescuing him from a burning building.  (Not that everyone would thank a fireman that way, of course.)  Alma sees, and Williams' shock/disbelief in those moments earned her the Oscar nom right there.  Ennis makes a lame excuse to run out with Jack. Alma, still holding her purse to got out, is heartbreakingly left in her kitchen to try and make sense of what the hell she just saw.  The scene established that that it was Ledger's character (relatively more ""straight-acting""), not Gyllenhaal's (more ""sensitive""), that was more desperate for the relationship.  At the same time, we feel Alma's emotional abaondoment (though she stayed with underachieving, increasingly-detached Ennis for years afterwards).It's not post-tragedy hyperbole to say that Ledger's is the best of an excellent group of performances.  At first, he's the stereotypical ""Marlboro Man"", but the facade keeps cracking, first with Gyllenhaal, then in the big fight with Williams, and finally when alone.  Of course, Ledger didn't even sound like the Marlboro Man in ""real life"" (i.e., Australian accent).I wish more (anyone?) had written about whether Lureen's description of events in her phone call with Ennis, or what seemed to be Ennis' vision during that call, was what ""really"" happened.  My cousin insists Lureen was hiding the truth to save face.  I don't think this should have been left to conjecture, because if Ennis' vision was correct, his decision to avoid committing to Jack becomes at least partially vindicated.It's wrong to trash this movie over its gay content.  I wonder if that superficial reaction prodded some of the movie's fans to consider ""Brokeback Mountain"" an Oscar-caliber epic when I'm not sure that's the case.  I think it's excellent, am fairly certain it deserved to be nominated (but not to win*), and admire (exceptions noted above) the way it deals with a traumatic situation that happens much more often than is acknowledged (think of the Hollywood hunks that were married to gorgeous ladies but ""came out"" later in life).  I'm just not sure this is an all-time classic.  But definitely a must-see for Heath Ledger fans and for the acting all around.*After the Oscars, I did a long review of why ""Crash"" DID deserve to win.  Amazon readers were unimpressed by a current vote of 11 to 4.  Well, at least 15 people read that one...now to review ""Capote"", ""Good Night and Good Luck"", and ""Munich"" so I can get slammed three more times...",4,Controversial?  This?

The film is unique because it is not the typical gay stereo-type; perhaps it is the first mainstream film ever made on this topic?Ennis Del Mar (played by the very talented Heath Ledger) is a very quiet and rough around the edges kind of man. He doesn't show his feelings very well and is somewhat of a loner. Jack Twist (played by the equally accomplished Jake Gyllenhaal) is more vocal about his feelings and emotions, but can still be pushed around (although I did enoy it when he stood up to his bigoted father-in-law).What makes this tale so bitter is that their's is a forbidden love. It is reminiscent of ""Titanic"" or Romeo and Juliet. Please keep in mind that the picture took place during 60's, 70's, and early 80's, in Middle-America where no one was openly gay, much less a cowboy. But, despite all their differences and personal demons both men loved each other more than life itself.Anyone with connected eyeballs can tell that Ennis and Twist were deeply in love (this was not an affair, rather it was a serious relationship that lasted over two decades). It was proof that Twist loved Ennis when they were on the hill getting ready to leave after he playfully lassoed and punched Ennis. Twist looked so sad to have intentionally inflicted pain on his lover. But Ennis holed off and punched him, because no one was gonna make Ennis his fool. And it was evident that Ennis loved Twist when he sobbed like a baby on the street after they departed Brokeback Mountain separately.The cinematography in this picture was absolutely stunning. The soundtrack is also amazing. I am certain that this picture is very Oscar-worthy.I saw this movie about a month ago and I still can't get it out of my mind.

I also heard jokes like could you imagine Clint Eastwood in a movie like this?  With all that everyone said (mostly negative) about this movie, I wanted to watch it anyway.  What I found was that we still live in a very stereotype driven country.  If it is about homosexuals, hetros like me need to stay away, or be made fun of for seeing it.  After viewing this movie, I came away thinking wow!  Ang Lee (director of ""The Hulk,"" ""Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"" among others) really brought his ""A"" game with his beautiful visuals and his ability to film this visceral film.  This movie in no way was gay porn, not even close.  The movie is about two individuals who take on a job in a secluded outdoor area and develop a special bond after an intimate, unplanned event occurred.  The film tracked their progress through marriage, children and their secret outings.  The film also details two completely opposite personas with regards to their beliefs of what their relationship is, where it is going and how their inner conflict compounds their daily living and relationships with others.  It is too bad for Heath Ledger that the male lead category for the Oscars was so loaded with great performances, but I think he had just as good of a performance as winner Hoffman.  Gyllenhall's performance was good, however, he has not proven to be as dynamic of an actor as Ledger or others.  Gyllenhall, in my opinion, with his sad eyes, and same walk, plays the same part whether in ""Donnie Darko,"" ""Jarhead"" or this movie.  Ledger's versatility was proven again during this movie and we can continue to expect great things from this actor in future endeavors.  I have seen all Oscar best picture nominated films and thought winner ""Crash"" was good, but not best picture good, then I saw ""Capote"" and thought for sure that that was the movie that should have won it.  However, after seeing ""Brokeback Mountain,"" Ledger's performance, the story, the scope of the cinematography and the screenplay, I would have to cast my vote for ""Brokeback Mountain.""

I believe if some is gay deep inside they cannot pretend to be somebody else.  Pretending to be someone else is more harmful than helpful, and they end up suffering more.  Society is still scared to death of people who are ""too different.""  What a powerful lesson this film teaches.  Even Dora should understand that her so called Christian moralizing does not match up with the truth exuding from this award winning film.  Until human beings are able to understand people who are different rather than hurting them, we are still running in place.  We have a ways to go.It's all about tolerance the Golden Rule...treat others like you would like to be treated.  You should know this if you are a 5th grader or a senior citizen.  The ethic of reciprocity (or the Golden Rule) is a general moral principle found in virtually all religions and culture, often as a fundamental rule, a fact which suggests that it may be related to innate aspects of human nature (see altruism). It is most commonly rendered as ""do unto others as you would have them do unto you"", or in other words ""treat others as you want to be treated"".In most formulations it takes a passive form, as expressed by the Jewish sage Hillel: ""What is hateful to you, do not to your fellow man.""In Western culture, however, the most famous formulation is active, as expressed in the Torah as ""love your neighbor as yourself"" (Leviticus 19:18).This traditional guiding rule was (and is) so highly valued that it has for centuries been known in English as the ""Golden Rule"".Congrats on those who had the guts and integrity to make this picture.

Plenty of reviews have already done that.However, I do want to address some of the complaints about this movie.  I have heard people complain that Brokeback Mountain wouldn't be getting as much recognition if it were a love story between a man and woman. These people are claiming that the movie really isn't very good but is achieving critical acclaim due to the its controversial storyline.  I cannot disagree more, and here is why:1)  This is NOT just a movie about gay cowboys.  Yes, the two men fall in love and carry out out a twenty-year long affair.  However, the movie is more about unrequited love, and how external influences can prevent true love from ever fully blossoming.  I know plenty of movies that received a huge amount of critical acclaim that sound very similar:  The Bridges of Madison County, Titanic, and Love Story are good examples.  These are audience favorites that remind us how painful and sad love can really be--and Brokeback Mountain accomplishes this as well.2)  The ""controversial"" content really isn't all that ground-breaking.  Doesn't anybody remember other critical favorites that touched upon homosexual love?  The Color Purple??  That was over twenty years ago!  And Brokeback and the Color Purple also both focus on OTHER issues besides being gay--family, violence, and finding strength and confidence in one's self.3)  There are other factors that make this movie great besides the controversial content--the musical score is beautiful, the acting is right on target (Heath Ledger in particular succeeds in exuding multiple emotions while barely speaking), the cinematography is gorgeous, and the screenplay is a model of how to adapt a short story into a movie--it keeps all the scenes and dialogue while expanding the areas that help move the plot forward (the women in particular get larger roles in the movie).All in all, I feel that anyone who says this movie is getting all this attention simply because it's about two men falling in love hasn't watched the movie.  They haven't seen it, or they'd realize it encompasses what could be the largest human desire that we know of:  that we all want to be loved, and when we find that person we shouldn't let him or her go.

It is quite simply a Masterpiece from it's first frame to it's last. It is not anything as trivial as THE gay cowboy movie. If anything it is about two bisexual men but it is so much more than that. I will probably get heaps of unhelpful votes for the following statements but that is fine. Last I heard America still had freedom of Speech so here goes; Brokeback Mountain lost the Best Picture Oscar because the voters were afraid of it's theme and because of political pressure.

172569,ABDAHMRYSMMIV,1417030321,"John Ellis ""jonthes""","[25, 29]","""Brokeback Mountain"" isn't a breakthrough film because it's about a homosexual relationship, or about sex between two 'manly' cowboys, it's because its true subject is passion and thwarted devotion. The sex in it between the men is chaste to a fault - the sex between them and their wives in their troubled marriages is much more explicit, though plot points are deftly made in those scenes. The film isn't being attacked for the very limited sex, it's the deep love that has raised protests, boycotts, attempts to block the sale in certain states. Those attempts of course only highlight how little has changed. If Scorsece's jealous gibe that it looks like a Marlboro commercial is true in a few shots, that's because the Marlboro commercials were beautifully shot. Scorsece would not have been able to resist hammering home the violence in the plot; Ang Lee handles that with great artistry that I hope (but doubt) will be influencial, not a second more than is necessary to the story. Ennis' last line is debated in some circles like Rhett's. I read it as an expression of devotion too late to mean anything; and heartbreaking because it's what most of us do or experience in love, there is usually a very small window for true love or passion to be acted on, then it's lost. When you figure that out, it's too late, it's gone. The hope of art is that seeing a situation from outside we can grow out of it. ""Brokeback"" is the rare Hollywood film that even attempts to work as art. It gets it all right, and is largely as simple as a fable. It is a film with an open heart.

They should step down from office like they promised in 1994. Anyway, two western guys shepherding high in the mountians alone one summer experience physical love. Guilty, at first, they part & go on to assume tradtional married with children lives. They meet years later & it's obvious the attraction is still strong. What follows is a bittersweet affair spanning many years. Ennis is the silent stoic type, apparently emotional empty & ambivalent if not for Jack. He's alive & willing it seems, to chuck everything & pursue a permenant life with Ennis. It seems that their love is only fully realized with the background of the mountain where they first fell in love. They visit it as often as they can get away from their familes. There they can love without fear or guilt in the vast, quiet beauty of the that place. It ends like a tragic, Shakeperean play. Heath Ledger as Ennis & Jake Gyllenhaal as Jack may never be better than they are in this movie. The real winner is the spectacular beauty of the mountain.

Many movie-goers tend to think of gay characters as funny, frivolous, silly and ridiculous. To a certain degree this is the way gay characters have been portrayed on the silver screen and on our TV screens as well.  Even very entertaining tv sitcoms such as WILL AND GRACE are actually at times unintentionally reinforcing Society's overview of negative stereotypical behavior - see the funny gay next door neighbor, isn't he cute, isn't he fun to be around ~ we don't have to take him seriously. Then, flip over to another station to watch QUEER EYE FOR THE STRAIGHT GUY - hey look, look at these gay guys, aren't they funny, aren't they cute, they sure know how to decorate - they sure do know about fashion - they are ""harmless"" enough, we don't have to take them seriously. Along comes BROKEBACK MOUNTAIN.....hey wait a minute!  These guys seem just like two regular guys....they aren't funny ~ they don't seem to know about fashion....they have real feelings for each other and have genuine love for each other which they can't express openly due to the confines of Society's borders - what is ""this"" all about?

But, that it does and this movie shows the ups and downs of the aftereffects of such restrictions. And when there is no vocabulary to discuss a relationship that isn't supposed to exist because it supposedly isn't normal, yikes!This movie takes place before there were clearly places to go off to live permanently in order to avoid the disapproval of those who frown on gay relationships. And it shows what happens when two men in love have to play it straight in order to keep from getting killed. But, beyond that, it shows the tragedy of this when the love is of a higher order than even the so-called normal people can achieve.It would be nice if someday a movie like this could actually end happily ever after. But, for now, it reflects a bitter pill that we all must swallow. As a society, if we really want to promote love and kindness, we ned to get past the need to box love into sterilized categories. We also need to recognize the beauty of the clandestine relationships that result from our oppression, not be too judgemental, and perhaps accept that what we call normal may need to be redefined a little.It is up to each of us to resolve the moral dilemmas in this movie. The acting is evokative, the secenery stunning, the symbolism deep. But, most importantly, it gives us all something to chew on. And I think it is meant to indicate to us that there is much more at stake than social order.

I talk myself out of the experience 9 out of 10 times when I think of the process of getting there, including wrestling with traffic and parking, and thinking of the reality of sitting there through 20 minutes of commercials and movie previews before the real show begins.Challenges aside, the movie was worth seeing.It starts off like soft Gay porn with lots of writing around it to dilute or slow the build to the first sex scene in the tent.Beginning in the 1960's, the characters are both White, thin and too pretty, which only supports an idealized version of the cowboys from what I feel is a very homoerotic stance.You can feel the tension building between Jack's pursuing of Ennis, using alcohol to build courage in one and lower inhibitions in the other.Then at that first sex scene in the tent when the Ennis mounts Jack from behind and does the classic porn spit (in lieu of lubricant) into his hand before doing the deed, I'm left thinking Ennis is either not as inexperienced as he plays to be or Ang Lee was going for the money shot.Over the course of the next 20 years Ennis and Jack build a world of lies with marriages and children, only to escape on fishing trips to Brokeback Mountain for time they could share with each other.  Their time together is sweet, image filled and a chance to learn more about the conversationally challenged Ennis.The flavor of the story, even when it isn't, is made to feel tragic.  Repressed Ennis was initially a conquest for the worldlier and scheming Jack.  Jack is made fun of in his Straight world as a mess-up, and Ennis just isn't smart enough to get out of his own way.Jack ends up being Gay bashed and Ennis remained dirt poor with only his memories of Brokeback Mountain.

Those people are not only wrong, but they're also missing the entire point of the film. If the story was between a man and a woman instead of two men, there simply would be no Brokeback Mountain; there would be no story to tell because the whole subject and theme of the film lies within two MEN who fall in love and the conflict of their own feelings towards each other. Besides being a love story (a beautiful and profoundly moving one at that), Brokeback Mountain is also (as the Amazon reviewer accurately puts it) a social study about the ""ripple effects"" that the denial of this love has not only on Ennis and Jack, but also on those close to them. Being forced to live a life of lies, secrecy, doubt and emotional disconnection because the people around just don't understand what you're going through. And that's what makes the film so powerful and insightful.I've read other reviews condemning Jack and Ennis' affair because the film supposedly wants to sympathize with two men cheating on their wives. Again, people missing the point. As mentioned early, that is one of the ""ripple effects"" of Ennis and Jack not being able to fulfill their love. You see, if society was fully accepting of homosexual relationships at the time (not that they completely are now) the film is set in, Ennis and Jack would've never been forced to marry women and live a life of lies, secrets and unfulfilment. Not only wasn't homosexuality not accepted by society at the time, but gays were also MURDERED just for being gays, as the film points out in Ennis' flashback. So basically, these men just couldn't live as they were, so they had no choice but live ""normal"" lives.That brings me to the other theme the film tackles, which is self-acceptance. Within their social context, Ennis and Jack didn't see themselves as gay because they simply didn't accept it or even approached the concept. So when they realize how they feel for each other, they just don't know what to make of their feelings; they deny and even reject their own nature (""I ain't queer""). It's not only about society not accepting their ""kind"" of love, it's about THEM not fully accepting and giving in to each other; especially Ennis, whose fear and complete inability to accept both himself and Jack's love is what ultimately dooms them, which makes the love story even more devastating.Anyone who can't understand what the film's message is and what it's aiming for either needs to have a moral and conscience check, or is simply beyond help.",5,People missing the point...,1143676800,"03 30, 2006",2006,2775,"[""'ve"", 'noticed', 'few', 'reviews', 'mentioning', 'film', ""n't"", 'saying', 'anything', 'relevant', 'social', 'tolerance', 'would', ""n't"", 'have', 'received', 'attention', 'considered', 'groundbreaking', 'story', 'was', 'man', 'woman', 'falling', 'love', 'instead', 'two', 'men', 'people', 'are', 'not', 'only', 'wrong', ""'re"", 'also', 'missing', 'entire', 'point', 'film', 'story', 'was', 'man', 'woman', 'instead', 'two', 'men', 'simply', 'would', 'be', 'Brokeback', 'Mountain', 'would', 'be', 'no', 'story', 'tell', 'whole', 'subject', 'theme', 'film', 'two', 'MEN', 'who', 'fall', 'love', 'conflict', 'own', 'feelings', 'other', 'being', 'love', 'story', 'beautiful', 'profoundly', 'moving', 'one', 'Brokeback', 'Mountain', 'also', 'Amazon', 'reviewer', 'accurately', 'social', 'study', 'ripple', 'effects', 'denial', 'love', 'not', 'only', 'Ennis', 'Jack', 'also', 'close', 'Being', 'forced', 'live', 'life', 'lies', 'secrecy', 'doubt', 'emotional', 'disconnection', 'people', 'just', 'do', ""n't"", 'understand', 'what', ""'re"", 'going', 'what', 'film', 'so', 'powerful', 'insightful.I', ""'ve"", 'read', 'other', 'reviews', 'condemning', 'Jack', 'Ennis', 'affair', 'film', 'supposedly', 'sympathize', 'two', 'men', 'cheating', 'wives', 'Again', 'people', 'missing', 'point', 'mentioned', 'early', 'one', 'ripple', 'effects', 'Ennis', 'Jack', 'not', 'being', 'able', 'fulfill', 'love', 'see', 'society', 'was', 'fully', 'accepting', 'homosexual', 'relationships', 'time', 'not', 'completely', 'are', 'now', 'film', 'set', 'Ennis', 'Jack', 'would', ""'ve"", 'never', 'been', 'forced', 'marry', 'women', 'live', 'life', 'lies', 'secrets', 'unfulfilment', 'Not', 'only', 'was', ""n't"", 'homosexuality', 'not', 'accepted', 'society', 'time', 'gays', 'were', 'also', 'MURDERED', 'just', 'being', 'gays', 'film', 'points', 'out', 'Ennis', 'flashback', 'So', 'basically', 'men', 'just', 'could', ""n't"", 'live', 'were', 'had', 'choice', 'live', 'normal', 'other', 'theme', 'film', 'tackles', 'self-acceptance', 'social', 'context', 'Ennis', 'Jack', 'did', ""n't"", 'see', 'gay', 'simply', 'did', ""n't"", 'accept', 'even', 'approached', 'concept', 'So', 'when', 'realize', 'how', 'feel', 'other', 'just', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'what', 'make', 'feelings', 'deny', 'even', 'reject', 'own', 'nature', 'ai', ""n't"", 'queer', 'not', 'only', 'about', 'society', 'not', 'accepting', 'kind', 'love', 'THEM', 'not', 'fully', 'accepting', 'giving', 'other', 'especially', 'Ennis', 'fear', 'complete', 'inability', 'accept', 'Jack', 'love', 'what', 'ultimately', 'love', 'story', 'even', 'more', 'devastating.Anyone', 'who', 'ca', ""n't"", 'understand', 'what', 'film', 'message', 'what', 'aiming', 'needs', 'have', 'moral', 'conscience', 'check', 'simply', 'help']",N/A
172579,AX0KJ7MZDKLBM,1417030321,Joseph Rochetto,"[8, 10]","I want to respond to a few of the comments by other reviewers.  First, let me say that Brokeback Mountain is a powerful movie and a work of art.  I am a gay man and have seen hundreds of gay movies, including ""gay cowboy"" movies.  None have moved me as much as this movie.  All the actors, the writing, directing, etc. are phenominal.  Heath Ledger is remarkable.  How a twenty-six year old straight male can have such understanding, compassion and depth of emotion is almost incomprehensible to me.Now to my remarks.  One writer wishes Ennis had spoken more and was unmoved by the shirt scene towards the end.  This scene just blows me away and brings me to tears even after seeing it 5 times.  Ennis doesn't speak much because that is the way Annie Proulx wrote the character.  Ang Lee and the screenwriters are being true to the story.Second, several writers commented that they did not see the reason for the relationship between Jack and Ennis.  This actually is perhaps too subtley revealed in a brief flashback Jack has near the end of the movie when Ennis, as a young man, walks up to him from behind and holds him very tenderly.  To those who have not seen the movie this scene is depicted in a lot of posters and such you may have seen.  This scene is a reference to a few lines in the original story.  Both men came from very emotionally impoverished lives.  We know that Jack was never really loved or emotionally supported by his father. The view of his childroom bedroom reveals a total bareness of emotion, love or beauty in his upbringing.  In the short story it is stated that the memory of this one embrace and all the feeling that came with it, the emotions it freed, twenty years earlier, and not sex, is what kept Jack coming back to Ennis for twenty years of ""infrequent high altitude f...ks"".  I can understand this completely.  Jack, in that embrace, experiences all the emotional closeness and warmth he never had from any man growing up.  It must be a tremendous release to a man, born gay, but having no understanding of warmth between men.  Jack returns again and again to Ennis because of the power of this early embrace.  Would they make it as a couple if they actually lived together twenty years?  Who knows?  Who cares?

172580,A34D06JL7LC6MU,1417030321,"Joshua Miller ""Josh""","[21, 28]","This movie was the ""IT"" movie of 2005. It was the most talked about, most joked about, it scored the most Oscar nominations.It won 3 Academy Awards including Best Picture for director Ang Lee and was the subject of the big Oscar upset when 'Crash' won Best Picture. Personally, I think 'Crash' was a better movie. But despite it's labels (""the gay cowboy movie"") and the jokes made on it's behalf (Brownback Mountain, etc.) this movie proves to be one of the best films of 2005 and a deeply sad movie about unexpected love. I'm straight, so I was worried when I saw this movie just how affected I would be by the love story of two men...I was surprised. Oscar nominee Heath Ledger (Best Actor, Brokeback Mountain) stars as Ennis Del Mar, a tightlipped cowboy searching for work. Ennis ends up at a trailer where he meets Jack Twist (Oscar nominee Jake Gyllenhaal). The two are hired (by Randy Quaid) to herd sheep on Brokeback Mountain. After a while on the mountain the two hit it off and one cold night they end up having sex. The scene is somewhat graphic, but not sickening. Both Ennis and Jack are surprised by the sudden act, neither one of them are aware that they're gay. That's expressed in a fantastic scene as the two stand on a mountain and Ennis says ""You know, I ain't no queer"".""Me neither"" Jack replies. Anyway, when the job ends; both men go their separate ways. Ennis marries a woman named Alma (Oscar nominee Michelle Williams) and has two daughters. Jack moves to Texas and marries Lureen (Anne Hathaway, obviously trying to shed her ""Princess Diaries"" image) and has a son. Four years pass, when Ennis recieves a postcard from Jack. The two meet up and the passion is rekindled immediately. For the next 20 years the two continue their relationship, with Jack insisting that the two can live together somewhere on their own ranch. The tighlipped Ennis however realizes that can never be so...Also, Jack is the only one who seems to really accept that he's gay...Picking up a male prostitute in Mexico and forging a relationship with a man in Texas. Now, this story isn't really just about two gay cowboys. It's about forbidden love and I'm going to paraphrase Roger Ebert's review here; but it could have just as easily been about a muslim man and jewish woman ora black man and a white woman. It shows that love can happen at anytime even with someone you least expect. It's deep stuff.Ledger finally gets to step out into the limelight and Gyllenhaal shows off some more acting chops (which he's done before in movies like ""The Good Girl""). I haven't seen Michelle Williams outside of anything other than ""Dawson's Creek"" and it's amazing to me that she could strike up the kind of emotions she does as Alma, the wife who knows of her husbands relationship but is to nervous (and scared) to bring it up with him. Hathaway was underrated in her role as Lureen, Jack's wife and shows that she could begin to be taken seriously in the years to come. This is a marvelous film, that I highly recommend.GRADE: A-",5,"An Affecting Film, No Matter What Your Sexuality Is",1144195200,"04 5, 2006",2006,3029,"['movie', 'was', 'IT', 'movie', '2005', 'was', 'most', 'talked', 'most', 'joked', 'scored', 'most', 'Oscar', 'nominations.It', 'won', '3', 'Academy', 'Awards', 'including', 'Best', 'Picture', 'director', 'Ang', 'Lee', 'was', 'subject', 'big', 'Oscar', 'upset', 'when', ""'Crash"", 'won', 'Best', 'Picture', 'Personally', 'think', 'was', 'better', 'movie', 'labels', 'gay', 'cowboy', 'movie', 'jokes', 'made', 'behalf', 'Brownback', 'Mountain', 'etc', 'movie', 'be', 'one', 'best', 'films', '2005', 'deeply', 'sad', 'movie', 'unexpected', 'love', ""'m"", 'straight', 'was', 'worried', 'when', 'saw', 'movie', 'just', 'how', 'affected', 'would', 'be', 'love', 'story', 'two', 'men', 'was', 'surprised', 'Oscar', 'nominee', 'Heath', 'Ledger', 'Best', 'Actor', 'Brokeback', 'Mountain', 'Ennis', 'Del', 'Mar', 'tightlipped', 'cowboy', 'searching', 'work', 'Ennis', 'up', 'trailer', 'where', 'Jack', 'Twist', 'Oscar', 'nominee', 'Jake', 'Gyllenhaal', 'two', 'are', 'hired', 'Randy', 'Quaid', 'herd', 'sheep', 'Brokeback', 'Mountain', 'while', 'mountain', 'two', 'hit', 'off', 'one', 'cold', 'night', 'end', 'up', 'having', 'sex', 'scene', 'somewhat', 'graphic', 'not', 'sickening', 'Ennis', 'Jack', 'are', 'surprised', 'sudden', 'act', 'one', 'are', 'aware', ""'re"", 'gay', 'expressed', 'fantastic', 'scene', 'two', 'stand', 'mountain', 'Ennis', 'know', 'ai', ""n't"", 'queer', 'Me', 'Jack', 'replies', 'Anyway', 'when', 'job', 'men', 'go', 'separate', 'ways', 'Ennis', 'woman', 'named', 'Alma', 'Oscar', 'nominee', 'Michelle', 'Williams', 'two', 'daughters', 'Jack', 'Texas', 'marries', 'Lureen', 'Anne', 'Hathaway', 'obviously', 'trying', 'shed', 'Princess', 'Diaries', 'image', 'son', 'Four', 'years', 'pass', 'when', 'Ennis', 'postcard', 'Jack', 'two', 'meet', 'up', 'passion', 'rekindled', 'immediately', 'next', '20', 'years', 'two', 'continue', 'relationship', 'Jack', 'insisting', 'two', 'can', 'live', 'together', 'somewhere', 'own', 'ranch', 'tighlipped', 'Ennis', 'however', 'can', 'never', 'be', 'so', 'Also', 'Jack', 'only', 'one', 'who', 'really', 'accept', 'gay', 'Picking', 'up', 'male', 'prostitute', 'Mexico', 'forging', 'relationship', 'man', 'Texas', 'Now', 'story', ""n't"", 'really', 'just', 'two', 'gay', 'cowboys', 'forbidden', 'love', ""'m"", 'going', 'paraphrase', 'Roger', 'Ebert', 'review', 'here', 'could', 'have', 'just', 'easily', 'been', 'muslim', 'man', 'jewish', 'woman', 'black', 'man', 'white', 'woman', 'love', 'can', 'happen', 'anytime', 'even', 'someone', 'least', 'expect', 'deep', 'stuff.Ledger', 'finally', 'step', 'out', 'limelight', 'Gyllenhaal', 'more', 'acting', 'chops', 'done', 'movies', 'Good', 'Girl', 'have', ""n't"", 'seen', 'Michelle', 'Williams', 'anything', 'other', 'Dawson', 'Creek', 'amazing', 'could', 'strike', 'up', 'kind', 'emotions', 'Alma', 'wife', 'who', 'husbands', 'relationship', 'nervous', 'scared', 'bring', 'up', 'Hathaway', 'was', 'underrated', 'role', 'Lureen', 'Jack', 'wife', 'could', 'begin', 'be', 'taken', 'seriously', 'years', 'come', 'marvelous', 'film', 'highly', 'recommend.GRADE', 'A-']",N/A
172581,A34KMBISGBIBK1,1417030321,"J. Perrotta ""screamqueen73""","[40, 46]","Spectacular! There are no words to describe just how moving and honest and real this film is. The bottom line here is a message that transcends all barriers; gay or straight, male or female, rich or poor. The message is that love comes in many forms and if you are ever lucky enough to find a love so deep and strong, you must hang onto it regardless of all other outside factors. And when you don't, you very well could end up with nothing just as Ennis DelMar does. This is not a gay cowboy movie. It is an honest look at love and how two people who have the world against them try to follow their hearts but succumb to the pressures of a society that doesn't understand that love must transcend all.I've read a lot of the other reviews and it seems that everyone has a different take on Jack and Ennis's relationship. But this is how I see it:  Yes, they were both gay and they were both in love, not in lust, with eachother. Lust doesn't last 20 years and the fact that they did go on to have so-called ""normal"" relationships with the women they married was not because they were bisexual but because they were doing what they thought they ""had"" to do. They tried hard to deny who they really were inside and married women, had families, then girlfriends but this was all part of the social pressure they felt to be ""normal"". Jack had more guts than Ennis did and was desperate to have a life with him because he needed him and loved him so badly, but Ennis was too uncomfortable with his love for Jack, was too embarrassed by it and couldn't have followed his heart because he was too consumed with the murder of the gay man he'd witnessed as a child. It isn't until the end, when Jack is gone, that Ennis comes to the realization that he let the love of his life slip through his hands. His daughter has found love and is getting married, Alma has remarried and Ennis finds himself alone with nothing to love or hang onto because he let his fears and insecurities about who he was come before his true love for Jack. The lesson is a hard one but the message is simple: No matter who you are or who you love, don't let anyone tell you who you should be. If you have love to give, give it freely and to whomever you wish. Never, never, never deny your heart.",5,A Masterpiece of Modern Cinema,1150502400,"06 17, 2006",2006,2262,"['Spectacular', 'are', 'words', 'describe', 'just', 'how', 'moving', 'honest', 'real', 'film', 'bottom', 'line', 'here', 'message', 'barriers', 'gay', 'straight', 'male', 'female', 'rich', 'poor', 'message', 'love', 'many', 'forms', 'are', 'ever', 'lucky', 'enough', 'find', 'love', 'so', 'deep', 'strong', 'must', 'hang', 'regardless', 'other', 'outside', 'factors', 'when', 'do', ""n't"", 'very', 'well', 'could', 'end', 'up', 'nothing', 'just', 'Ennis', 'DelMar', 'not', 'gay', 'cowboy', 'movie', 'honest', 'look', 'love', 'how', 'two', 'people', 'who', 'have', 'world', 'try', 'follow', 'hearts', 'succumb', 'pressures', 'society', ""n't"", 'understand', 'love', 'must', 'transcend', 'all.I', ""'ve"", 'read', 'lot', 'other', 'reviews', 'everyone', 'different', 'take', 'Jack', 'Ennis', 'relationship', 'how', 'see', 'Yes', 'were', 'gay', 'were', 'love', 'not', 'lust', 'Lust', ""n't"", 'last', '20', 'years', 'fact', 'did', 'go', 'have', 'so-called', 'normal', 'relationships', 'women', 'married', 'was', 'not', 'were', 'bisexual', 'were', 'doing', 'what', 'thought', 'had', 'do', 'tried', 'hard', 'deny', 'who', 'really', 'were', 'inside', 'married', 'women', 'had', 'families', 'then', 'was', 'part', 'social', 'pressure', 'felt', 'be', 'normal', 'Jack', 'had', 'more', 'guts', 'Ennis', 'did', 'was', 'desperate', 'have', 'life', 'needed', 'loved', 'so', 'badly', 'Ennis', 'was', 'too', 'uncomfortable', 'love', 'Jack', 'was', 'too', 'embarrassed', 'could', ""n't"", 'have', 'followed', 'heart', 'was', 'too', 'consumed', 'murder', 'gay', 'man', ""'d"", 'witnessed', 'child', ""n't"", 'end', 'when', 'Jack', 'gone', 'Ennis', 'realization', 'let', 'love', 'life', 'slip', 'hands', 'daughter', 'found', 'love', 'getting', 'married', 'Alma', 'remarried', 'Ennis', 'alone', 'nothing', 'love', 'hang', 'let', 'fears', 'insecurities', 'who', 'was', 'come', 'true', 'love', 'Jack', 'lesson', 'hard', 'one', 'message', 'simple', 'matter', 'who', 'are', 'who', 'love', 'do', ""n't"", 'let', 'anyone', 'tell', 'who', 'should', 'be', 'have', 'love', 'give', 'give', 'freely', 'whomever', 'wish', 'Never', 'never', 'never', 'deny', 'heart']",N/A

You name it, if it's an American Icon, it's been trashed ..... the church, the Pilgrims, Columbus, George Washington, sports heroes, American business, the American military, the police, the President, ""Dead White Males,"" etc etc.  All to cut out our beliefs, make us weak, make us ashamed of our heritage, and open us up to radical change.  BUT there was always the Cowboy.  The Cowboy, the strong, self-reliant, self-confident yet humble, physically and mentally tough Cowboy.  He faced down the elements, wild animals, Indian attacks, and outlaws; he rode horses all day, roped cattle, slept out in front of a fire, and shot guns when he had to.  Now THAT was an image that Americans could look upon and get some inspiration from.So of course, Hollywood had to go after the Cowboy and trash him in our minds.  Replace that image with something twisted.  OK, let's see, let's make him gay!  And two of them getting it on out in the wilderness!  Now, make this into a seemingly intelligent, compelling & artful movie, so the critics have less reason to put it down, and there it is ............ you've just shot down one of America's icons.  Anytime anyone brings up the Cowboy as an example of America's proud past and toughness, and some snide jerk will snicker, ""Oh yeah, just like Brokeback Mountain,"" and undercut the argument with sarcasm and derision.  SO that's what this movie is all about.  It's called Cultural Marxism.  Destroy America's cultural icons, and you can manipulate Americans.  (See my review of American Beauty for another example.)The filmmakers dropped two gay Greenwich Villiage guys into Wyoming and Texas, made them cowboys, and ran their little ""love"" story.  They COULD HAVE changed the characters and setting and kept a similar story, but no, they had to go for the jugular, and trash the image of the Cowboy.  Next thing you know, they'll make a movie about Patton and make him gay.  Or two gay Marines on Iwo Jima.  Whatever.As for the plot, the acting, the scenery, the story, the music, the directing, that's all secondary to this agenda.  But I give the movie 3 stars because much as you might HATE the agenda, the story is entertaining.",3,The Tainting of the Last American Icon,1280880000,"08 4, 2010",2010,2392,"['American', 'Icons', 'have', 'been', 'attack', 'last', 'half-century', 'so', 'process', 'was', 'started', 'Left', 'accelerated', ""'60s"", 'counter-culture', 'carried', '70s-today', 'Hollywood', 'television', 'name', 'American', 'Icon', 'been', 'trashed', 'church', 'Pilgrims', 'Columbus', 'George', 'Washington', 'sports', 'heroes', 'American', 'business', 'American', 'military', 'police', 'President', 'Dead', 'White', 'Males', 'etc', 'cut', 'out', 'beliefs', 'make', 'weak', 'make', 'ashamed', 'heritage', 'open', 'up', 'radical', 'change', 'BUT', 'was', 'always', 'Cowboy', 'Cowboy', 'strong', 'self-reliant', 'self-confident', 'yet', 'humble', 'physically', 'mentally', 'tough', 'Cowboy', 'faced', 'down', 'elements', 'wild', 'animals', 'Indian', 'attacks', 'outlaws', 'horses', 'day', 'roped', 'cattle', 'slept', 'out', 'front', 'fire', 'shot', 'guns', 'when', 'had', 'Now', 'THAT', 'was', 'image', 'Americans', 'could', 'look', 'get', 'inspiration', 'from.So', 'course', 'Hollywood', 'had', 'go', 'Cowboy', 'trash', 'minds', 'Replace', 'image', 'something', 'twisted', 'OK', 'let', 'see', 'let', 'make', 'gay', 'two', 'getting', 'out', 'wilderness', 'Now', 'make', 'seemingly', 'intelligent', 'compelling', 'artful', 'movie', 'critics', 'have', 'less', 'reason', 'put', 'down', ""'ve"", 'just', 'shot', 'down', 'one', 'America', 'icons', 'Anytime', 'anyone', 'up', 'Cowboy', 'example', 'America', 'proud', 'past', 'toughness', 'snide', 'jerk', 'will', 'snicker', 'Oh', 'yeah', 'just', 'Brokeback', 'Mountain', 'undercut', 'argument', 'sarcasm', 'derision', 'what', 'movie', 'called', 'Cultural', 'Marxism', 'Destroy', 'America', 'cultural', 'icons', 'can', 'manipulate', 'Americans', 'See', 'review', 'American', 'Beauty', 'example', 'filmmakers', 'dropped', 'two', 'gay', 'Greenwich', 'Villiage', 'guys', 'Wyoming', 'Texas', 'made', 'cowboys', 'ran', 'little', 'love', 'story', 'COULD', 'HAVE', 'changed', 'characters', 'setting', 'kept', 'similar', 'story', 'had', 'go', 'jugular', 'trash', 'image', 'Cowboy', 'Next', 'thing', 'know', ""'ll"", 'make', 'movie', 'Patton', 'make', 'gay', 'two', 'gay', 'Marines', 'Iwo', 'Jima', 'Whatever.As', 'plot', 'acting', 'scenery', 'story', 'music', 'directing', 'secondary', 'agenda', 'give', 'movie', '3', 'stars', 'because', 'much', 'might', 'HATE', 'agenda', 'story', 'entertaining']",N/A
172583,A1LVZOK9F7K4CN,1417030321,JR Pinto,"[26, 31]","I am a little suspicious of short stories that are turned into movies.  I always wonder: How are they going to fill the other hour-and-a-half?  Strangely, this problem does not occur in Brokeback Mountain.  I'd read the short story first and - watching the movie - I did not feel that they were padding for time.  In fact, it seems like the story can barely be contained to the time restrictions of the movie.Perhaps this is because this movie is about emotions and images - not words.  Its characters are not from a very verbal society.  In fact, it is a running joke in the film how little Ennis (Heath Ledger) speaks.  The little dialogue from the short story lasts the whole movie.This is a Western - Ang Lee beautifully captures the Wyoming countryside.  When the action moves into town, the sight of man's raunchy trailers and houses set against the backdrop of the majestic mountains makes a convincing argument for nature over civilization.It is civilization that is ultimately the downfall of these two characters.  They meet and fall in love - all the while convinced that they are not homosexuals.  The story begins in 1963 and - if it had occurred a little later - tragedy may have been averted.  Yet, despite the tragic overtones of the story, there is still something joyful about it.  Despite all odds, these two men find each other and - a few times a year at least - find true happiness.

172584,A2GM9GNP2G8HO1,1417030321,J. R. SOUTH,"[5, 6]","A hundred years from now, when cinema is being discussed, ""Brokeback Mountain"" will be loved, degraded, re-evaluated, and argued about. And that is the mark of a truly great film. I am still befuddled that the Oscar voting swayed the best film award of 2005 to ""Crash"", and even more perplexed by its backhanded honor to Jake Gyllenhaal with a best supporting actor nomination, when clearly, he not only gave an astonishing performance in a leading role, but was impetus behind the entire storyline. I mean, for crying out loud, without Jake/Jack's first sexual overture, or his postcards to Ennis, what would have created the plot? Long before I had even heard about ""Brokeback Mountain"", I tried to watch ""Crash"", not once, but twice, and only made it through less than a half-hour. ""Crash"" is a pretentious, fragmented mess, loaded with pretty movie stars delivering cardboard acting jobs. It disappeared from theatres ""molto pronto"", fell off the DVD sales market even faster, and despite its windfall, it will soon be forgotten completely. Yes, ""Brokeback"" was overhyped and overtalked about, but that was because of the AUDIENCE's response to it. Before it opened, the producers worried that they'd never be able to market it, but it was word-of-mouth that pushed the film over the top. You'd think that respecting its enormous, unexpected success might have occurred to the academy, since they've been trying desperately to get people back into the movie houses. Instead, they shot themselves in the foot. While ""Crash"" rehashed and reheated the old-time Hollywood racial theme, ""Brokeback Mountain"" opened up a whole new can of beans. And isn't it way past time that maintream media started lifting its opinion of gays out of the baffoonery basement? To the socially unaware, a staggering amount of adolescent suicides are directly relatable to unresolved issues of homosexuality. Why? Largely because young gay people, particulary males, have no role models. Richard Simmons? Isaac Mizrahi? Jack on ""Will & Grace""? Yes, Tommy, there are gay men who are not annoying, self-centered clowns. I won't bother mentioning all the well-known actors shamefully hiding in the closet. When will Hollywood start telling the truth about Plato, Socrates, Aristotle, Proust, Henry James, Tchaicovsky, Michaelangelo, Leonardo da Vinci, Walt Whitman, Cole Porter, Christopher Marlowe, Tennessee Williams, Edward Albee, Alexander the Great, Herman Melville, Ismail Merchant, James Ivory, Dag Hammarskjold . . . Hey, how about a movie about some high school kids that instigate a Gay History Week?Whew! Okay, ""Brokeback Mountain"" is ultimately to be appreciated as a tragic love story. Romeo and Juliet can now back off. Seeing this movie is an emotional watershed, an epiphany. It confirms that art can be life-transforming.The most astonishing thing about ""Brokeback Mountain"" is the acting by Heath Ledger and Jake Gyllenhaal. Even if you viewed this movie with no expectations as to what it was about, and even though it's at least a half-hour before Jack and Ennis become remotely sexual, the instant you see them together, you'll be struck by their chemistry. It leaps off the screen and practically sits in your lap. We see and feel immediately that there is going to be more than a buddy movie unravelling. Truly astounding. Imagine: two men in a love story, giving performances that up to now had only come from the likes of Gable and Lombard, Tracy and Hepburn, Streisand and Redford. Now that's progress! Ledger and Gyllenhaal deserved every accolade they recieved, and then some.""Brokeback Mountain"" is not a grandiose, cinematic epic. There is no overbearing music playing, there are no incredibly fancy camera shots, the actors are not made up to look like movie star gods. It is a very slow film, as it needs to be. It makes us ask ourselves ""How and why do particular people come into our lives? What is at work that randomly throws two combustable souls together?"" As I think about Jack and Ennis, haphazardly thrown together by chance, alone on a mountaintop, what are the odds that these two would find exactly what they were looking for in each other? I cannot get out of my mind this phrase: ""What God has joined together, let no man put asunder.""I love it that there are so many diverse thoughts and feelings about ""Brokeback"". Several gay men told me they were bored out of their minds, but afterwards, could not stop talking, thinking, or crying about it. Some heterosexual friends said there should have been more love scenes, others thought the utter peacefulness and boyish roughhousing between Ennis and Jack when they were alone together spoke volumes. Many told me they hadn't realized how many ""straight-acting"" homosexuals they actually knew until they were reminded by Jack and Ennis. The most bizarre comment came from Gene ""Time To Retire"" Shalit, who described Jack as a sexual predator! Try saying that about Rhett Butler, Gene!!! I myself find it interesting that while Jack initiates, Ennis then takes the reigns, and Jack willingly succumbs to him. Throughout the movie, Jack and Ennis trade ""roles"", so to speak. As in real life, nothing is a stereotype. It's also fascinating that despite Ennis supposed innocence and naivte, when push comes to shove, he instantly knows exactly how to respond to Jack's advances.The time and place of ""Brokeback Mountain"" have loaded the film with interesting subtexts. Starting in 1963 and ending in the seventies, we can't help but muse ""Is it possible these characters really existed? Is Ennis still alive? Did he ever find Jack in some wonderful hereafter?"". As many have stated already, having the story set in today's world would probably just end up like a long, complicated episode of ""Queer As Folk"". Not having to deal with AIDS, crowded gay dance clubs, gyms, and high fashion, ""Brokeback"" is able to maintain a beautiful simplicity.One of the most touching realities presented in ""Brokeback Mountain"" is the importance of holding on to a loved one's possessions, in this case, Ennis' blood-stained shirt that hangs for years in Jack's childhood bedroom, with Jack's shirt on top of it. So much emphasis is placed on the sexual aspects occurring between men, which is a actually a tiny percentage of what homosexuality is really all about. Like Jack and Ennis, anyone can determine to bed a woman, produce children, and successfully live a lie. It is the profound emotional attachment that comes before and after the sexual act that differentiates gay from straight orientation.There is another element in this film that is as universal as its love story, the element of choice, of being true to yourself. Ennis gives in to simple decisions: to be responsible to his children, to his income, to his safety. To Jack, he will only give in to maintaining a status-quo relationship. Could there be no other option, no way to find some middle-ground? He makes an easy choice, and the result is tragic. Ennis begins as a lonely, pent-up man; finds love; changes and grows; and then unwittingly throws it all away, ending up in a lonlier hell than he started in.Something there for all of us.",5,One for

Just because it was the first of its kind or different does not automatically make it any good. Another year of the awards season and another year of great disappointment. Million Dollar Baby last year started the downward slide for me. Everyone talked about it but it really wasn't that good.  Same with this movie BB. For purely entertainment value it has no substance. My wife personally hates any movie that advocates cheating on your spouse behind their back so that does make her a little biased.So from an entertainment value perspective, this movie just doesn't perform.

These two amazing gentlemen captured human emotions & feelings so fantastically I cannot explain. Heath was exceptional as Ennis! He just brought the character to life and made us understand where he was coming from and how difficult it was for him to accept what he was feeling, wanting, and going through. Heath comes across as a stubborn man who doesn't want to accept what he feels for Jake. One of my favorite scenes is when he and Jake say goodbye and Jake's looking at him walk away through the car side mirror. Then Heath's character shows how he feels when he is kneeling down in the barn house and is huffing and puffing and crying because he's so confused, angry, and sad about what's he's feeling inside and because Jake and him just said goodbye. The kissing scenes and the scenes of them lying down together were magnificent. Although the scenes had something to do with sexuality they also had to do with human release and being at peace and ease with another human soul. There was so much art and beauty shown in this film that you can't help but watch it again and again. The maturity and depth shown in this movie is outstanding. I give both Jake & Heath props for their incredible portrayal of two human souls in the most beautiful and realistic way. This film has made me an even bigger fan of both Heath & Jake. I respect them and their talent so much now. I must also admit that seeing them together was a bit of a turn on for me not only because they are two handsome hotties. But also because they portrayed the male species in a more humanly beautiful way than I have ever seen on film. Although Heath seemed so angry and hard to get through to you could understand why and what made him act that way. Some may look at some of the scenes when they're fighting and see them as violent. But for me I saw it as the venting of confusion that they both were feeling and going through. I mean Heath's character was brought up to be some kind of a tough guy and manly man. So when Heath's character Ennis starts to have feelings for Jake's character Jack this ignites Ennis's state of confusion and unwillingness to accept what he's feeling inside. It's like he wants this thing inside of him to go away but he can't control it. It seems to me like that makes him more and more withdrawn through the film and more unable to express himself. He wants to deny what is happening but can't deny his feelings for Jake's character. I really enjoyed this film because it was so mature and so real. I also loved Michelle Williams's portrayal of Ennis's devastated wife. She was right on the money in every scene. I also loved Anne Hathaway as Jack's wife. You could sense what Anne was feeling in a single facial expression! All and all the actors were great. The feel of the film was so real and intense.

Homosexuality has never been explored in a film in a dramatic way, it has always been comedic. While the love in this film is between two males, it doesn't detract the heterosexual viewer from the film. The story is genuine and it works on every level. Two young men find summer work by herding sheep atop Brokeback Mountain in Wyoming. After spending lots of time alone in the wilderness a friendship is born that leads to a passion for one another. The movie's time span is several years, and personally I think the way it was done wasn't the best choice.. Everything happens so fast. One summer they are atop Brokeback Mountain, and then all of a sudden it's half a year later. The audience is closed off to the rest of the characters' lives from point to point. So the story focuses only when they meet back together to head back up and spend time together. For me, that pacing didn't work. It doesn't hurt the film overall, but I think the emotional impact could have been greater if we focused on a more detailed look into the characters. What Ang Lee does with this film is bring an immense appreciation for the setting and the surroundings. Cinematography is a sure win come Oscar night for Brokeback Mountain. Ang Lee takes the time to stop and look at the beauty of nature and how it envelopes the characters in this paradise from the rest of civilization and the rest of their lives. This forbidden love soon starts to work against them when word gets out. Relationships with their wives are shattered, and society shuns them, which leads to the very emotional ending. It doesn't matter if your gay or not, the film is made in a way that allows it to be accepted by any audience. The film is very well done, but I was not fond of the jumpy storyline where we skip ahead a few months or a year every now and then.ACTING: Heath Ledger and Jake Gyllenhaal give great performances, but I don't think it's going to win them any Oscar gold. Michelle Williams gives an amazing performance as Ledger's outcast wife, who ultimately uncovers his secret life. The acting is top notch, all of them do fine work.BOTTOM LINE: When I go into a film like this I expect an emotional punch to get the audience really involved, however it may be hard for everyone to find an emotional connection with this movie. I was not as moved as when I saw character driven films like Million Dollar Baby or The Station Agent.

My perception is that both Ennis and Jack ""are"" bisexual, but find wide disagreement on this question with various critics claiming they are straight, bisexual or gay. Similarly, we experience the circumstances of Jack's death as a feared uncertainty rather than something we can attach a label to (""accident"", ""hate crime"", etc).

(Don't worry; I am not going to say any more about the ending.) Ever since I've heard those last three words - and I've heard them twice - it has been hard to extract them, and all that leads up to them, out of my head.Brokeback Mountain may look, on first blush, to be a 'gay cowboy' film. Believe me when I - and other reviewers - tell you that it is infinitely more than that. It is a story of two people (yes, of the same sex) who are hopelessly in love....in secret. Jack Twist is the sensitive and optimistic one. Ennis Del Mar is the quintessential cowboy - the silent and guarded one. When thse two meet in '63 on Brokeback Mountain, they do not realize how each will change and help shape the other for the better part of the next 20 years.If you are only familiar with Heath Ledger as the Aussie sex symbol of Cassanova and A Knight's Tale, then you have only seen part of him. His evocation of Ennis Del Mar are spectacular. While it is too early in this young actors career to go too far out on a limb, I predict that when all is said and done, this may be the role he is known for! It is obivous that he knows this character well. This is not to discount Jake Gyllenhaal's perfect-fit performance as Jack Twist. It is just to say that Jack lacks the delicate nuances of Ennis.The cinematography is fantastic! If you are reading this review, then you have probably missed your chance to see this on the big screen and that is a shame. Whatever you do, see this on a nice, big, widescreen tv. The shots of the Wyoming (actually, Canadian) landscape are awesome, and match the film's emotional beauty with physical beauty.As said, this film is about a 20 year love affair that tests its characters to their limits. Two characters are forced to come to grips with their homosexuality (bisexuality?) in a time, place, and occupation that does not allow such a thing. They must keeep the identity of their one true love a secret from their female lovers, who can't help but pale in comparison. It is love story that is (unlike every other love story) not at all cliche as it adds this extra dimension.Yes, the film is a character film and as such, it moves slow. It is approximately 2 1/2 hours but - at least to my eyes - this is time well spent. Every minute of this film is there for a reason; to give you as true and unadulterated a glimpse into these two characters as is possible.

From the previews I saw I figured it depicted gay men in a negative light by getting married and eventually hurting the women and children they belonged to. But I was wrong.This movie isn't about that. It is about love, plain and simple.There aren't the descriptives here to express the ability this movie has to move you.The acting is stellar from all. The story is excellent and carried out very well on screen. The cinematography is breathtaking at times and the music truly reflects the mood.The basic theme of this movie is that love will strike in it's own time, and with whomever it deems is 'the one'. The love that struck the two main characters here was taboo and they do the best they can to quell the fire within them. When the realization hits that it's bigger than the mountain they met on they meet throughout the rest of their lives to satiate the need they have for each other.The angst, confusion, identity issues and all the other problems that would go with a 'taboo' love are what carry this movie.An unlikely forerunner in the award category, this movie is destined to be a classic. It has all the right elements.If you have been hesitant to watch this movie because of the theme do yourself a favor.... rent it and watch it.

172603,A1W661TC1P6VQI,1417030321,"Kevin T. Rodriguez ""The Movie Wizard.com Revi...","[61, 181]","Every year the world gets at least one controversial film that is hailed by critics, and usually wins a lot of awards. ""Brokeback Moutain"" has been labled as ""the gay cowboy movie,"" which sounds about right to me. It may be me, but I'm more likely to side with the hecklers in this case then with the critics. When ""Fahrenheit 9/11"" came out the critics hailed it as a ""revolutionary film,"" one that apparently was so good that it was said that ""it [didn't] matter whether you were left or right, [""Fahrenheit 9/11""] is a great film."" Of course, we all know these statements to be complete lies barely two years later.But maybe the critics are right in this case. Maybe ""Brokeback Moutain"" IS a movie that can change the way we think about gay lovers?! I went into the movie with an open mind, ready to have my beliefs challenged. Strangely enough, I can sum up what ""Brokeback Moutain"" is in brief, simple summery: ""Brokeback Moutain"" is a glorified affair. As you all know, ""Brokeback Moutain"" revolves around two sheep herders (Ennis and Jack) who get drunk, have sex, and (supposingly) fall in love. Then they get back to the real world, they both get married, they have kids, but they still remember the nights they shared on Brokeback Mountain.Then one day, Ennis receives a letter from Jack, suggesting that they go back to Brokeback Moutain for another fling (although he doesn't say it like that per se). They both know that they can never be together, but they do make a choice to keep seeing each other at Brokeback Mountain every few months. Through the years Ennis and Jack spend continue with their real lives, with those few days a year they can see each other when they are in total bliss. All the while they hurt their wives, they neglect their kids to a certain extent, and they hurt friends.Some people see this movie as a great tradgedy because these two men love each other but can't be together. I, on the other hand, saw two men who lusted for each other, and ended up being complete jerks who did nothing but cheat on their wives and have no problem with this. Ok, time for the sarcasm to end and it's time to get serious. Despite all the praise this film gets, despite all the things that are being said about this series, at the end of the day this is about two men having an affair and hurting the people they are married to. This fact seems to have went over almost everyone's head. The fact that these two characters are hurting their loved one's doesn't seem to matter much to the people praising this film.I have to wonder, if the coupld had been a man and a woman, would all this deception and cheating be as overlooked as it is here? It's also hard to believe in the romance itself, seeing as how it was birthed from a night where the characters had one too many drinks, not because they actually fall in love. They just have a hard night of sex and before you know it they're a couple. Sorry, but I'm not convinced. Throughout this whole film there was only one believable character in the whole movie, and that character is the Michelle Williams character. When Williams character discovers that her husbend is cheating on her, we truly feel sorry for her as her marriage falls apart.The scene where she finally confronts her husbend about his affair with another man, I almost started to cry for her, as she was outright lied to, and her life was, more or less, greatly damaged. For some reason, some of the people I saw the film with sided with Ennis during this scene, because the Williams character ""didn't understand what Ennis was going through."" I couldn't help but wonder what any of the other characters had to do to get sympathy. The boys boss (played by Randy Quade) has been said to be a biggot, when in reality he couldn't care less about the two boys sexuality, he's just mad that they let his sheep get eaten while they were keeping themselves busy.I will admit that the acting is good, and the cinatography is beautiful, but I can't in all honesty recommend a movie where the main characters seem to okay with hurting people they care about, with very few consequences. I've never cared about movies that are about glorified affairs, and this one is no different.",1,"""Brokback Mountain"": A Glorified Affair",1136851200,"01 10, 2006",2006,4214,"['year', 'world', 'least', 'one', 'controversial', 'film', 'hailed', 'critics', 'usually', 'lot', 'awards', 'Brokeback', 'Moutain', 'been', 'labled', 'gay', 'cowboy', 'movie', 'about', 'right', 'may', 'be', ""'m"", 'more', 'likely', 'side', 'hecklers', 'case', 'then', 'critics', 'When', 'Fahrenheit', '9/11', 'came', 'out', 'critics', 'hailed', 'revolutionary', 'film', 'one', 'apparently', 'was', 'so', 'good', 'was', 'said', '[', 'did', ""n't"", ']', 'matter', 'were', 'left', 'right', '[', 'Fahrenheit', '9/11', ']', 'great', 'film', 'course', 'know', 'statements', 'be', 'complete', 'lies', 'barely', 'two', 'years', 'later.But', 'maybe', 'critics', 'are', 'right', 'case', 'Maybe', 'Brokeback', 'Moutain', 'movie', 'can', 'change', 'way', 'think', 'gay', 'lovers', 'went', 'movie', 'open', 'mind', 'ready', 'have', 'beliefs', 'challenged', 'Strangely', 'enough', 'can', 'sum', 'up', 'what', 'Brokeback', 'Moutain', 'brief', 'simple', 'summery', 'Brokeback', 'Moutain', 'glorified', 'affair', 'know', 'Brokeback', 'Moutain', 'around', 'two', 'sheep', 'herders', 'Ennis', 'Jack', 'who', 'get', 'drunk', 'have', 'sex', 'supposingly', 'fall', 'love', 'Then', 'get', 'back', 'real', 'world', 'get', 'married', 'have', 'kids', 'still', 'remember', 'nights', 'shared', 'Brokeback', 'Mountain.Then', 'one', 'day', 'Ennis', 'letter', 'Jack', 'suggesting', 'go', 'back', 'Brokeback', 'Moutain', 'fling', ""n't"", 'say', 'per', 'se', 'know', 'can', 'never', 'be', 'together', 'do', 'make', 'choice', 'keep', 'seeing', 'other', 'Brokeback', 'Mountain', 'few', 'months', 'years', 'Ennis', 'Jack', 'spend', 'continue', 'real', 'lives', 'few', 'days', 'year', 'can', 'see', 'other', 'when', 'are', 'total', 'bliss', 'hurt', 'wives', 'neglect', 'kids', 'certain', 'extent', 'hurt', 'friends.Some', 'people', 'see', 'movie', 'great', 'tradgedy', 'two', 'men', 'love', 'other', 'ca', ""n't"", 'be', 'together', 'other', 'hand', 'saw', 'two', 'men', 'who', 'lusted', 'other', 'ended', 'up', 'being', 'complete', 'jerks', 'who', 'did', 'nothing', 'cheat', 'wives', 'have', 'problem', 'Ok', 'time', 'sarcasm', 'end', 'time', 'get', 'serious', 'praise', 'film', 'things', 'are', 'being', 'said', 'series', 'end', 'day', 'two', 'men', 'having', 'affair', 'hurting', 'people', 'are', 'married', 'fact', 'have', 'went', 'almost', 'everyone', 'head', 'fact', 'two', 'characters', 'are', 'hurting', 'loved', 'one', ""n't"", 'seem', 'matter', 'much', 'people', 'praising', 'film.I', 'have', 'wonder', 'coupld', 'had', 'been', 'man', 'woman', 'would', 'all', 'deception', 'cheating', 'be', 'as', 'overlooked', 'here', 'also', 'hard', 'believe', 'romance', 'seeing', 'how', 'was', 'birthed', 'night', 'where', 'characters', 'had', 'one', 'too', 'many', 'drinks', 'not', 'actually', 'fall', 'love', 'just', 'have', 'hard', 'night', 'sex', 'know', ""'re"", 'couple', 'Sorry', ""'m"", 'not', 'convinced', 'whole', 'film', 'was', 'only', 'one', 'believable', 'character', 'whole', 'movie', 'character', 'Michelle', 'Williams', 'character', 'When', 'Williams', 'character', 'discovers', 'husbend', 'cheating', 'truly', 'feel', 'sorry', 'marriage', 'apart.The', 'scene', 'where', 'finally', 'husbend', 'affair', 'man', 'almost', 'started', 'cry', 'was', 'outright', 'lied', 'life', 'was', 'more', 'less', 'greatly', 'damaged', 'reason', 'people', 'saw', 'film', 'sided', 'Ennis', 'scene', 'Williams', 'character', 'did', ""n't"", 'understand', 'what', 'Ennis', 'was', 'going', 'could', ""n't"", 'help', 'wonder', 'what', 'other', 'characters', 'had', 'do', 'get', 'sympathy', 'boys', 'boss', 'played', 'Randy', 'Quade', 'been', 'said', 'be', 'biggot', 'when', 'reality', 'could', ""n't"", 'care', 'less', 'two', 'boys', 'sexuality', 'just', 'mad', 'let', 'sheep', 'get', 'eaten', 'were', 'keeping', 'busy.I', 'will', 'admit', 'acting', 'good', 'cinatography', 'beautiful', 'ca', ""n't"", 'honesty', 'recommend', 'movie', 'where', 'main', 'characters', 'seem', 'okay', 'hurting', 'people', 'care', 'very', 'few', 'consequences', ""'ve"", 'never', 'cared', 'movies', 'are', 'glorified', 'affairs', 'one', 'different']",N/A

""Kimberly""","[8, 32]","I orginally saw this movie expecting it to live up to all the hype such as being told it was ""one of the movies that will change the cinema forever."" The movie itself is simplistic seen from a casual observer. You see the forbidden love/romance but, I was not convince that the love between Jack & Ennis was geniune you really see a few moments between here and there that make you feel as though they have a love connection- but the moments are so brief you cannot real see the true connection between the two.The movie taps into gay issues- such as hidden romance- not being able to reveal your ""true self"" or being misunderstood in society. For that the movie might change the cinema forever- making more movies that relate to gay romance/gay romance more accepted(because how it is NOT accepted in society in the movie).Ledger does an amazing job as Ennis a man torn between his own wants and what others expect of him. Both men do have families- and the beginning of both marriages seem almost like a sham or something that would have NEVER worked out regardless of how much either partner tired. The wives are portrayed as cold, non-responsive, and un-thoughtful... leading to perhaps that DIRE need Ennis & Jack have to be together and retreat to the place they intially fell in love ""Brokeback Mountain.""But, I seriously doubt that ""Brokeback Mountain"" will be here for generations or become the classic of this decade like ""Titanic"" or ""Casablanca"" will always live on. The truth is the movie has recieved the hype not for the movie itself but mainly the story matter- never has a gay romance movie gone mainstream or been accepted for that fact ""Brokeback Mountain"" will shape the history of the cinema and the United States. But, I highly doubt that future generations will look upon the movie as a ""classic"" but, more as a meer stepping stone in politics and society's views.If you don't want to see the movie for religious reasons or for personal beliefs than just don't see it- The movie will NOT convert or convince anyone to change their lifestyle or change their own views and truth is anyone who is against homo-sexuality for personal or religious reasons will NOT see the movie.

I had heard about it on the radio, on TV, and even in Saturday Night Live skits--and I had to see what all the buzz was about. So I picked up the short story by Annie Proulx (which was FANTASTIC) and then headed to the theater. I am so glad that I went to see this film!Brokeback is, as everyone already knows, the story of two ""gay cowboys"" who fall in love one summer in Wyoming. But really, that is only the surface of what this film is truly about. At its core, Brokeback is a romance that focuses on repressed love, longing, and the struggles of relationships. For these reasons, I believe that it can be relatable to anyone, gay or straight. It is also a film about acceptance--and the pressures society places on all individuals to conform to whatever is considered ""normal."" These are obstacles that we all face in today's world--and this film sends a powerful message about the need to respect all people (even if they are different from ourselves).The performances by Heath and Jake are extraordinary, the scenery is fantastic, and Gustavo Santaolalla's score is beautifully haunting. The love, pain, and desire that all of the characters feel is completely believable; I hope that this film is given major attention at Oscar time.I would highly recommend this film, but it is certainly not for everyone.

She gave that distinctly American icon a whole knew sensibility and dimension here to date unheard of or at least not talked about out in the open.  Some have venerated her for it, while others have called what she wrote and act of blasphemy.  However you want to approach it, one cannot dismiss it.The same year it came out in the New Yorker (1997) Diana Ossana read it and brought it to the attention of her writing partner the venerable Larry McMurtry the writer of an epic novel about the friendship of two men and the lengths each man would go for the other in the remarkable Lonesome Dove.  Together Diana and Larry wrote the screenplay that because the foundation for the film Brokeback Mountain.  They shopped this screenplay around for years with people telling them it was a great script with heart and pathos and yet ultimately couldn't be made in Hollywood because of it's subject matter.That is until 2004, when Focus came into the picture and decided to take a chance, even in today political climate.  And with Ang Lee the director of the Ice Strom and Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon directing what could go wrong?  In the leads he cast up and coming stars Heath Ledger as the brooding, repressed Ennis Del Mar and Jake Gyllenhaal as the open and optimistic Jack Twist.Many have stated that this is a grand or epic love story.  Which while being the truth isn't the whole story.  It's more complicated than that.  It speaks in a small still voice to what happens when people are told who they love, how they love and how they want to live is wrong.  It's about the cause and effect that social morays can have not just generally but specifically.  And while Brokeback Mountain isn't a political film with a political agenda it does however speak to the political atmosphere both of the time it's set in and unfortunately of today as well; because for all that has change, more has stayed the same.This film isn't for everyone, the subject matter may be hard for some to digest, and impossible for others.  It may shatter the illusions some have of the west and or what some consider the Cowboy influence on our culture.  The truth of the matter is, as much as some don't like it, it's also part of who we are.  Gay, straight, or other, Brokeback Mountain, touches on something we can all understand and empathize with - the human condition - the human heart - the need to be loved - the need for human contact.  It speaks to the human heart and its capacity for love - hate and the repressing burden of self loathing.  It speaks to what can happen when what we need is starkly contrasted by what society says we can have.",5,Making the impossible happen....,1142726400,"03 19, 2006",2006,2856,"['Annie', 'Proulx', 'did', 'something', 'other', 'thought', 'was', 'impossible', 'when', 'sat', 'down', 'wrote', 'Spartanly', 'written', 'yet', 'beautifully', 'haunting', 'heartbreaking', 'short', 'story', 'Brokeback', 'Mountain', 'reinvented', 'American', 'Cowboy', 'gave', 'distinctly', 'American', 'icon', 'whole', 'knew', 'sensibility', 'dimension', 'here', 'date', 'unheard', 'least', 'not', 'talked', 'out', 'open', 'have', 'venerated', 'others', 'have', 'called', 'what', 'wrote', 'act', 'blasphemy', 'However', 'want', 'approach', 'one', 'can', 'not', 'dismiss', 'it.The', 'same', 'year', 'came', 'out', 'New', 'Yorker', '1997', 'Diana', 'Ossana', 'read', 'brought', 'attention', 'writing', 'partner', 'venerable', 'Larry', 'McMurtry', 'writer', 'epic', 'novel', 'friendship', 'two', 'men', 'lengths', 'man', 'would', 'go', 'other', 'remarkable', 'Lonesome', 'Dove', 'Together', 'Diana', 'Larry', 'wrote', 'screenplay', 'foundation', 'film', 'Brokeback', 'Mountain', 'shopped', 'screenplay', 'years', 'people', 'telling', 'was', 'great', 'script', 'heart', 'pathos', 'yet', 'ultimately', 'could', ""n't"", 'be', 'made', 'Hollywood', 'subject', 'matter.That', '2004', 'when', 'Focus', 'came', 'picture', 'decided', 'take', 'chance', 'even', 'today', 'political', 'climate', 'Ang', 'Lee', 'director', 'Ice', 'Strom', 'Crouching', 'Tiger', 'Hidden', 'Dragon', 'directing', 'what', 'could', 'go', 'wrong', 'leads', 'cast', 'up', 'coming', 'stars', 'Heath', 'Ledger', 'brooding', 'repressed', 'Ennis', 'Del', 'Mar', 'Jake', 'Gyllenhaal', 'open', 'optimistic', 'Jack', 'Twist.Many', 'have', 'stated', 'grand', 'epic', 'love', 'story', 'Which', 'being', 'truth', ""n't"", 'whole', 'story', 'more', 'complicated', 'small', 'still', 'voice', 'what', 'when', 'people', 'are', 'told', 'who', 'love', 'how', 'love', 'how', 'want', 'live', 'wrong', 'cause', 'effect', 'social', 'morays', 'can', 'have', 'not', 'just', 'generally', 'specifically', 'Brokeback', 'Mountain', ""n't"", 'political', 'film', 'political', 'agenda', 'however', 'speak', 'political', 'atmosphere', 'time', 'set', 'unfortunately', 'today', 'well', 'change', 'more', 'stayed', 'same.This', 'film', ""n't"", 'everyone', 'subject', 'matter', 'may', 'be', 'hard', 'digest', 'impossible', 'others', 'may', 'shatter', 'illusions', 'have', 'west', 'what', 'consider', 'Cowboy', 'influence', 'culture', 'truth', 'matter', 'as', 'much', 'do', ""n't"", 'like', 'also', 'part', 'who', 'are', 'Gay', 'straight', 'other', 'Brokeback', 'Mountain', 'touches', 'something', 'can', 'understand', 'empathize', 'human', 'condition', 'human', 'heart', 'need', 'be', 'loved', 'need', 'human', 'contact', 'human', 'heart', 'capacity', 'love', 'hate', 'repressing', 'burden', 'self', 'loathing', 'what', 'can', 'happen', 'when', 'what', 'need', 'starkly', 'contrasted', 'what', 'society', 'can', 'have']",N/A
172614,A1CDZNPO7U4E6N,1417030321,LadyLestat,"[0, 0]","First of all, let me just say that I watched this movie once, and even though I liked it this isn't something I would wanna see over and over again. With that being said, I knew, (just like I'm sure you all did) the subject matter of the film, so I don't see why some viewers (no matter how few) act so offended by what they saw. Secondly, you must take into account when this movie takes place (time and era). Thirdly, It seems that instead of dewelling on the superb acting and storyline people are more so effected by the fact that it's about homosexuality between ""gay cowboys"". I guess the point flew over their heads that this is indeed a love story, and as with most love stories (except for teen movies) they all end in tragedy. It's usually in that tragedy that the person realizes what they lost. It actually took Ennis losing Jack to realize that he was the love of his life. I liked it because it was a realistic and very delicate look at love between 2 males. If I wanted to see gay guys sleeping around I could've sat at home and watched ""Queer as Folk"". Another thing is that people seem to be more disgusted at 2 guys than 2 women. I guarantee you if it had been 2 women the guys would've been cheering them on. Anyway, this sort of thing this has been apart of films for as long as I could remember.Let's not forget, Hilary Swank..""Boy's Don't Cry"" or Charlize Theron...""Monster"" it's just that ""Brokeback Mountain"" is sooo in your face. At any rate, to stay on topic, Heath Ledger made his character so believeable that he deserves an Oscar for this. Ennis' inner struggle with his own purpose, identity and sexuality is one that some of my best friends have had to endure. Prejudice is another. Jake's character Jack was also believable, and he deserves an Oscar as well. Even though I may be a straight woman, I could still relate to those feelings of love and hope for someone that you love, and only getting feelings of isolation, regret, shame and embarrassment in return. My only gripe is that I wish they would've explained the ending a lot better. I kinda keeps you guessing about what actually happened to Jack. I think they should've talked more about that. Like, Was he murdered in hate crime fashion because he was gay? Did someone else besides their boss see them on Brokeback Mountain? Did he come on to the wrong guy? I guess I just want to know..Why did they kill him? Also, I'm a little curious because at the end when his wife was talking to Ennis about Jack's death she didn't seem grief stricken like a wife who just lost her husband would. Did she find out about him like Ennis' wife did? or Did her father have something to do with it after Jack stood up to him? I had tons of unanswered questions by the time the movie was over. Which, by the way, this film was way too long come to think of it.

The heart of this film is ""the path not taken"".It is compelling to watch someone look happiness in the eye and walk away from it.  This can happen in heterosexual relationships as well.  Sometimes people feel that they cannot be together.  Perhaps families do not approve, cultural boundaries make it difficult, religious obstacles are too much to overcome, etc.  It could happen to anyone, gay or not.If this type of story grabs you, you should also watch The Lover with Tony Leung and Jane March.  As the wealthy Chinaman wrote to his one-time school-girl, he ""would love her until death"".How ironic that this alleged ""gay cowboy movie"" resulted in the real life love story between Heath Ledger and Michelle Williams.  Jake Gyllenhall became the godfather to their daughter.  We will see Heath's face in Matilda for the duration.Among other things, I will remember Ledger for his response to all those that called him ""brave"" for taking on this role.  He answered something along the lines of ""no, it's people such as firefighters that are brave"".  What a humble reply from a remarkably gifted actor.

172618,A2NJO6YE954DBH,1417030321,Lawrance M. Bernabo,"[14, 20]","My first impression when I was watching ""Brokeback Mountain"" was that I was being underwhelmed.  The film was receiving universal raves and the public debate about the movie had started to turn to something of a backlash with the argument being that Heath Ledger and Jake Gyllenhaal should not praised as being brave for playing gay lovers because we are so far past the point when we can make any judgments about an actor's sexual orientation based on the roles we play.  That seems especially clear when this film wins the Golden Globe for best drama and the two top acting awards go to Philip Seymour Hoffman and Felicity Huffman for playing a gay man and a transgender man.  So the point being made about courage is valid enough, but given that ""Brokeback Mountain"" will be the most successful film to have love scenes between two men it does represent a hurdle of sort in American pop culture.It took me a while after watching this film to decide that the best parts of ""Brokeback Mountain"" are not the acting but rather the writing, directing, and music.  This is not to take anything away from the cast, but consider that the script does not really give them the sort of memorable acting moments that win people awards.  Ledger's character of Ennis Del Mar is wired so tight that his emotions barely constitute ripples on his surface.  As his wife, Alma, Michelle Williams is forced to put off her eruption over her husband's infidelities with another man for years.  The contrast between Ledger and Gyllenhaal's Jack Twist is that of ice and fire on the surface, and despite the passion that exists between the two men the story arc here is about Jack's efforts to get Ennis to thaw enough so that they can have it all rather than steal moments.I give the major credit for this film to the screenplay by Larry McMurty and Diana Ossana, based on the short story by Annie Proulx.  When a novel is adapted to the screen there is always so much left out, but with the source here being a short story there are hole, spaces of time really, built into the story.  The film provides sketches of the relationship between Ennis and Jack.  After the first sexual encounter between the two men, we never see that degree of intimacy again, and that leaves open the question of what sort of relationship they had.  I found myself wondering if the two achieved a level of reciprocity or if things continued along the same line.  My interest was not prurient, but rather a question of wanting to understand the character of Ennis and to know if he ever let himself be vulnerable in any way that another human being could tell.  Or did that moment come when he was literally all alone in Jack's bedroom?Consequently the cinematography of Rodrigo Prieto and the music of Gustavo Santaolalla become critical in filling in the gaps in the narrative.  Images and music end up revealing more than words and it is significant that when the depth of the love between Ennis and Jack is revealed that there is only images and music, and not a word is spoken.  The credit that is due director Ang Lee ultimately has to do with bringing these people together to make this movie and tell this story in this particular way.  In an age when a digital screen can be filled with a million images fueled by a combination of imagination and computers, there is something to be said for the sparseness of this film, and not just the idea that less is more.  ""Brokeback Mountain"" creates a elusive blend of intimacy and distance that actively compels its audience to make sense of it all and to find the truth the characters are reluctant if not unable to face.  Ennis will not tell us the depth of this tragedy.  That judgment is left to us.",5,"""If you can't fix it, you gotta stand it.""",1138147200,"01 25, 2006",2006,3714,"['first', 'impression', 'when', 'was', 'watching', 'Brokeback', 'Mountain', 'was', 'was', 'being', 'underwhelmed', 'film', 'was', 'receiving', 'universal', 'raves', 'public', 'debate', 'movie', 'had', 'started', 'turn', 'something', 'backlash', 'argument', 'being', 'Heath', 'Ledger', 'Jake', 'Gyllenhaal', 'should', 'not', 'praised', 'being', 'brave', 'playing', 'gay', 'lovers', 'are', 'so', 'far', 'point', 'when', 'can', 'make', 'judgments', 'actor', 'sexual', 'orientation', 'based', 'roles', 'play', 'especially', 'clear', 'when', 'film', 'Golden', 'Globe', 'best', 'drama', 'two', 'top', 'acting', 'awards', 'go', 'Philip', 'Seymour', 'Hoffman', 'Felicity', 'Huffman', 'playing', 'gay', 'man', 'transgender', 'man', 'point', 'being', 'made', 'courage', 'valid', 'enough', 'given', 'Brokeback', 'Mountain', 'will', 'be', 'most', 'successful', 'film', 'have', 'love', 'scenes', 'two', 'men', 'represent', 'hurdle', 'sort', 'American', 'pop', 'culture.It', 'took', 'while', 'watching', 'film', 'decide', 'best', 'parts', 'Brokeback', 'Mountain', 'are', 'not', 'acting', 'rather', 'writing', 'directing', 'music', 'not', 'take', 'anything', 'away', 'cast', 'consider', 'script', 'not', 'really', 'give', 'sort', 'memorable', 'acting', 'moments', 'win', 'people', 'awards', 'Ledger', 'character', 'Ennis', 'Del', 'Mar', 'wired', 'so', 'tight', 'emotions', 'barely', 'constitute', 'ripples', 'surface', 'wife', 'Alma', 'Michelle', 'Williams', 'forced', 'put', 'off', 'eruption', 'husband', 'infidelities', 'man', 'years', 'contrast', 'Ledger', 'Gyllenhaal', 'Jack', 'Twist', 'ice', 'fire', 'surface', 'passion', 'two', 'men', 'story', 'arc', 'here', 'Jack', 'efforts', 'get', 'Ennis', 'thaw', 'enough', 'can', 'have', 'rather', 'steal', 'moments.I', 'give', 'major', 'credit', 'film', 'screenplay', 'Larry', 'McMurty', 'Diana', 'Ossana', 'based', 'short', 'story', 'Annie', 'Proulx', 'When', 'novel', 'adapted', 'screen', 'always', 'so', 'much', 'left', 'out', 'source', 'here', 'being', 'short', 'story', 'are', 'hole', 'spaces', 'time', 'really', 'built', 'story', 'film', 'sketches', 'relationship', 'Ennis', 'Jack', 'first', 'sexual', 'encounter', 'two', 'men', 'never', 'see', 'degree', 'intimacy', 'again', 'open', 'question', 'what', 'sort', 'relationship', 'had', 'found', 'wondering', 'two', 'achieved', 'level', 'reciprocity', 'things', 'continued', 'same', 'line', 'interest', 'was', 'not', 'prurient', 'rather', 'question', 'wanting', 'understand', 'character', 'Ennis', 'know', 'ever', 'let', 'be', 'vulnerable', 'way', 'human', 'being', 'could', 'tell', 'did', 'moment', 'come', 'when', 'was', 'literally', 'alone', 'Jack', 'bedroom', 'Consequently', 'cinematography', 'Rodrigo', 'Prieto', 'music', 'Gustavo', 'Santaolalla', 'become', 'critical', 'filling', 'gaps', 'narrative', 'Images', 'music', 'end', 'up', 'revealing', 'more', 'words', 'significant', 'when', 'depth', 'love', 'Ennis', 'Jack', 'revealed', 'only', 'images', 'music', 'not', 'word', 'spoken', 'credit', 'due', 'director', 'Ang', 'Lee', 'ultimately', 'do', 'bringing', 'people', 'together', 'make', 'movie', 'tell', 'story', 'particular', 'way', 'age', 'when', 'digital', 'screen', 'can', 'be', 'filled', 'million', 'images', 'fueled', 'combination', 'imagination', 'computers', 'something', 'be', 'said', 'sparseness', 'film', 'not', 'just', 'idea', 'less', 'more', 'Brokeback', 'Mountain', 'elusive', 'blend', 'intimacy', 'distance', 'actively', 'audience', 'make', 'sense', 'find', 'truth', 'characters', 'are', 'reluctant', 'not', 'unable', 'face', 'Ennis', 'will', 'not', 'tell', 'depth', 'tragedy', 'judgment', 'left']",N/A

And everyone has an opinion about this film whether he or she has seen this film or not.  The opinions tend to follow the person's views on the gay issue.  This seems a little unfair because I think a good film should stand by itself and not just be a reflection of a personal opinion about its theme.The credits are impressive.  Ang Lee directed it.  As always, he makes the audience really understand his characters.  The two cowboys, as played by Heath Ledger and Jake Gyllenthal, become real and easily identifiable for their very human qualities.  The film is based on a short story by Annie Proulx.  She writes about the dark side of the American West, not the place of the great John Wayne myths.  The writer, Larry McMurtry and Diana Ossana are also experts on the west.  I would expect nothing but the best from them.The story is complex and more than the sum of its parts.  It starts in 1963 when the two young men spend a summer working together herding sheep on the lonely Brokeback Mountain.  For the entire summer, they have no other human companionship.  Naturally, a bond develops between them.  And then, on one cold and lonely night, they have a brief romantic encounter.  They both would like it to be only a one-time thing, but it isn't.  Their feelings grow for each other.  Later, they are discovered, go back to their respective lives, and try to forget each other.Both men marry.  Both have children.  The marriages are not happy.  And there are some scenes between these men and their wives that show the sadness and impact of these flawed marriages.  Then, several years later, the men come together again, and from then on, they spend several weeks each summer continuing their relationship on Brokeback Mountain.  They say they are going there to fish; but they never do bring home any fish.The story takes place over couple of decades.  It is a gloomy story, one that the audience knows will end badly.  There's fine acting, great scenery and everything else that deserves the accolades it received.Problem is, the film runs 134 minutes which is much too long.  The action is subtle and brings up unsettling emotions.  After a short while, I knew I had gotten the point of the film.  The storyline didn't really change and there were no surprises.

My problem with the film has nothing to do with subject matter or actors, although looking for nooky among sheep is a bit weird. Consider these items... Ang Lee is Taiwanese, and Annie Proulx lived most of her life in Maine, until recently moving to Wyoming. Is either of these folks gay? Does either one really understand the values and mind-set of cowboys or Wyoming natives? The film is based upon Proulx's short story, yet it lasts for two and a quarter hours. Add to this the fact that the film is too long for what it achieves... We have no flashbacks or voice-overs to help us understand each character's backstory. Less is more... Scenes would pack more punch if they established something about the characters in a focussed manner, but they drag on aimlessly. Yes, we have to know they're bored and lonely, but assume the audience is intelligent and gets it without overkill. The mountain scenes (pretty to National Geographic addicts) could easily be shortened. As touching as Ledger's pouting tight-lipped speech patterns might be, it is hard to understand the minimal dialogue with this added impediment. Now that gay films are more skilfully written and acted, they are more accessible to straight people. And they leave this film in the dust with regard to brilliant dialogue, backstory, likeable characters, excellent editing and character development.

172627,A2P9R2G8Y6CHBT,1417030321,"LombaireFan ""LF""","[19, 26]","Directed by Ang Lee and starring Heath Ledger and Jake Gyllenhaal, this is easily the most talked-about motion picture of the year, if not the decade. With all the controversy, the criticism, the parodies, it's hard to imagine anyone visiting this site not already familar with much of what takes place in this film. But out of respect for those who haven't seen it, my review contains absolutely NO spoilers.Brokeback tells the story of Ennis Del Mar (Ledger) and Jack Twist (Gyllenhaal), a pair of young ranch hands who over the course of an early '60s summer in Wyoming discover that they really enjoy doing things together. Things like swimming, fishing, horseback riding and just about anything else that might strike their fancy. But there's one catch: they really, really like doing things together. Like more than they've ever liked doing things with anyone else before. Herein lies the film's universality, as I think we all remember that one buddy from summer camp with whom we just could not part ways. Anyone who's been through that experience or anything similar will surely identify with the characters in this film, to some extent.So Ennis and Jack promise to be Best Friends Forever while agreeing to keep it ""on the downlow"", so to speak, as they both get married and start their lives in earnest. But neither can escape the feeling that they'd really rather be doing things together. They agree to get together once a year and return to Brokeback Mountain - and who can blame them? The scenery is gorgeous. However, the wives (Anne Hathaway, Michelle Williams) get a little concerned, as wives tend to do when a husband is spending all his time horsing around with one of his close pals and ignoring the homefront. Again, this is a movie that nearly every American male will relate to, though perhaps some more than others.As the film progresses, taking us further into the character's lives, it takes on tragic dimensions. We come to feel that Ennis and Jack were destined to do things together but their lives have been undone by society's tendency to frown upon certain people doing things together. Yes, it's a downer.But Brokeback Mountain is also a very thought-provoking film. I thought about it an awful lot afterwards, which is odd since I've never been a fan of cowboy movies. Certain scenes replayed in my thoughts a lot - so much so that I had to mentally recast the film just to get it out of my head; my version of Brokeback stars Danny DeVito and Paul Giamatti.

Now, this film is actually very beautifully shot. The scenery is just breathtaking. In fact, I constantly found my mind and my eye being drawn to the composition of the shots and grandeur of the landscapes, leaving me completely bored by the melodrama being played out in it's proscenium. There is one award worthy, performance in the film given by Michelle Williams as the betrayed wife of one of the two leads. Her characterization was strong, sympathetic and very moving overall. What I find the most interesting about all the excitement surrounding this film is that there was another film out this year with a similar plot line and situation to this film entitled, ""The Three Burials of Melquiades Estrada"". It was also about cowboys and concerned relationships, honor and duty, but without the homosexual angle that I feel was exploited in ""Brokeback"". ""Three Burials...."" was an extremely well made film but, sadly, without the tabloid sensationalism and hype lavished on ""Brokeback"", it remained relatively obscure and unnoticed by the general movie going public. But all that hype did not garner this film a Best Picture award and this may be a sign that the Academy members are finally starting to be a little more discerning of which films are bestowed that honor. Granted, ""Crash"" ended up with best picture and best song went to ""It's Hard Out Here For A Pimp"", so there is clearly still room for improvement.

172629,A1I9B4PSCDDWOO,1417030321,"lordhoot ""lordhoot""","[3, 10]","I would regard Brokeback Mountain as a solidly good movie but I won't called it great or excellent. This movie tells a story of two men, who happened to be in love with each other and spent their entire lives leading a double life. While this is a ""gay movie"", it more closer to a character study of these two men, trapped by custom, families, reputation and lack of understanding that make their lives so unhappy until they get reunited for their many ""fishing trips"" up to Brokeback Mountain. Both men, trapped by the conventions of their lives, endured the best they can, when they can to grabbed little happiness with each other. The entire movie centered around their relationship, their friendship and their love.The two male stars, Heath Ledger and Jake Gyllanhall carried this movie. For me, Ledger was quite surprising since he was really good in this movie. I figured that since he's such a pathetic actor in the past, getting by on his looks rather then his skills, he simply looked far superior then he really is. He also took the Charlize Theron path by muddling up his looks. He doesn't look like he does in the past movies or even his current one, Casanova. Jake Gyllanhall proves to be the weak link. He still haven't captured the skills needed to ranged out his character in a very convincing way. Both of them were ably supported by their supporting cast. The production values proves to be high and the dialogue overall, proves to be excellent.There are several weaknesses in this film that many critics have overlooked. First one and a very important one is that there seem to be a definite lack of chemistry between the two male lovers. A certain lack of spark between them, that any two lovers may have, may they be hetrosexual or homosexual. This is important since it almost looked like Ledger and Gyllenhaal are forcing it instead of feeling it. While film looked closely at their friendship, it doesn't look close enough in their love. A major weakness by Ang Lee who otherwise directed a fine movie. Second, the make up needed some work. Ledgar aged pretty well since he was muddled up in the first place but Gyllenhaal's make-up looked pretty faked. Adding gray don't aged a man.In many ways, this movie reminded me strongly of a German movie that came out in several years ago titled Aimee & Jaguar, a movie about two German women during World War II, finding love and friendship with each other. The situation seem to be very familiar between the two movies outside of the sex of the main characters.In my opinion, the critics have grossly overhyped this movie for some unknown political correctness. Its a good solid film, remarkably high quality but its a type of film that most people will see it once and probably won't see it again. But you should see it at least once. Thanks to Aimee & Jaguar, it been done before so there's no originality issue but its an interesting character study.

I won't go into all the plot detail as most reviewers feel compelled to do, but I did feel that, although the scenery is beautiful and the acting is believable, the story is not compelling.  Jack and Ennis are not terrribly sympathetic characters, and I felt the most empathy for Alma (Michelle Willliams), Ennis's long-suffering wife. The movie is not romantic at all, even though the director tries to bolster this view by setting the majority of Ennis and Jack's love scenes in the majestic, wild, and free Montana mountains.  To create a contrast between their love affair and their ""real-life"" (read ""forced"") relationships, the director made sure that scenes of Jack and Ennis's married life were set in oppressive, flat, ugly, and characterless towns drawn staight from ""Urban Cowboy.""

""If you can't fix it, you gotta stand it.""  This dialogue is repeatedly listenable, terse and dry, like the scenery.  The film follows western men Jack Twist (Jake Gyllenhaal) and Ennis Del Mar (Heath Ledger) over two decades of their relationship.  Both men are great actors and use their faces and bodies to paint the range of emotions associated with the paradoxical pleasure and pain of love and attraction, with all its glorious moments and terrible imperfections.The western Rockies (from Alberta through Wyoming) form the landscape for much of the film.  I love this country and the filmmaker respected its beauty and austerity.  The Tetons penetrate upward through the crust of the earth like fingers, skyward.  It's a land in which you can find time to think, where nature paints the skies with wind and cloud.  The film affords the thoughtful viewer reflective moments.A couple of things seemed a little silly to me.  ""Let's indicate it's the '70s by giving the boys identicle sideburns!""  And Twist wasn't entirely authentic as a rodeo cowboy, but he was fair.  On the plus side, some of the nuances of eye contact and body language as people - in an instant - try to sort each other out on the basics were expertly filmed.  I also loved the way the filmmakers made the connection between the touch and smell of physical artifacts as a token of a person who isn't present and very deeply missed.I didn't end up seeing this until after the passing of the Heath Ledger, and it's an extra sadness that this film now - in addition to everything else it does well - serves as a memorial to his great talent.  His portrayal of Ennis, a decent Wyoming ranchhand who settles into a dutiful dullness and only comes out of it into incandesence when his friend Jack comes around, is simply wonderful.  Also painfully wonderful is Michelle William's performance as Ennis' wife, Alma, a good woman who for a time submits to a relationship that's less than what she'd hoped for.  Her resignation is one of the saddest aspects of this film.  In many ways, the mantle of that suffering was picked up by Ennis' daughter, Alma Jr. (Kate Mara) as the film develops.And the music...  The lush guitar fills the film with an aural soundscape complementary to the visual. The orchestrated version of the main theme resonated with me in such a glorious and sad way, as though experiencing a orange and purple sunset one knows might be one's last.This is not a film that glorfies what Jack and Ennis had.

It is a story about about two men that find each other in the early 60s and fall in love. If everyone remembers what the early 60s were like for people of color, and everyone that  was a different faith than Christian. This was not a time of safety for anyone that was different from the white Christian hetrosexual family. With that being said, Jack and Enis did what they had to at the time the movie took place for the safety of themselves and their families. I find it very interesting what people are saying about this movie and why they don't like it. All that they are talking about is how these two men in love cheated on their wives. I ask myself, can these reviewers see the trees through the forest? Or better yet, can they see past their own noses (the reviewers) and walk in these men's shoes in that era being who they were? No, they would not have the strength to be who they were in those times. I am a person that came out in the 80s, into a society that was not accepting of me or my partner.

I give my heartfelt thanks to the entire cast, crew, writers, producers and director for making such a sublimely beautiful story. This movie depicts the tortured life of two poor, uneducated guys who just happened to be gay growing up in the deeply homophobic heartland (an oxymoron if I've ever heard one). Their story is painful to watch and makes you wonder, if in a different world, they would have lived long fulfilled happy lives.  But ignorance is alive and well in the good ol' USA guaranteeing many more years of tragic stories like this one for the unfortunate souls deemed unworthy of the righteous right.  Hopefully the laws of physics will keep humanity from reaching distant worlds for thousands of years to come.  The idiotic way we treat each other and our own planet is proof enough that we don't deserve such power and knowledge. More importantly however, alien species wouldn't deserve our hatred, bigotry and man-made religious intolerance!  Brokeback Mountain, though not intended, is a testament to human ignorance and intolerance!

172650,A1DZKOOMMJM1MI,1417030321,"Mark Twain ""Sam""","[32, 126]","Brokeback Mountain is by far the most disappointing film of the year. The glowing reviews are flowing in every major magazine and by every major critic. My friends kept telling me how amazing it was, how beautiful, and how achingly real. My boyfriend and I headed into the theatre excited and ready to be amazed. Half the audience applauded once the film was over. My boyfriend and I were relieved it didn't go on longer.The film starts off slowly, and goes on way too long, but that's not the problem. The main problem is that the film tries to be so artsy with its two second scenes and excruciating shots of nature, it never gives its audience a chance to know the characters. The main love story between two men lovers is never fleshed out, and I never understood what drew them together or why they had such a long and lasting relationship. All we ever see them do is fish, herd sheep, wrestle topless, skinny dip, and have very rough sex, which I found a really offensive stereotype. I did not notice any love between these two men, animal lust is more like it.The story is such a mess, important characters aren't even introduced until a good third of the way into the film, after which their storylines are wrapped up way too quickly. 1963 goes on for 45 minutes, and could have easily been cut down to 15, while the rest of the 20 years the story takes place flashes by. For what? For the sake of seeing our sheep herders (not cowboys by the way) do their job or take a break from it to eat a can of beans, or ten shots of sheep flocking by too many. These scenes do nothing to advance the story and instead make the film tedious and almost unbearable. The time could have been used to flesh out the cardboard characters instead.I'll give Brokeback Mountain one praise, and that is for its amazing and talented cast. Jake Gyllenhal and Heath Ledger are quite good, and Michelle Williams is terrific. Her long-suffering wife might be a clich&eacute;, but she is the most fleshed out, and most real character in the film. Anne Hathaway, a great actress, is almost wasted in her brief role, as are Anna Farris and Linda Cardellini, in almost cameo roles, which definitely could have used some fleshing out, or deleting altogether. The rest of their scenes were no doubt deleted to make room for more shots of nature, sheep, and topless wresting scenes between the two men.To say BrokeBack Mountain is disappointing is not enough. With all the praise it's receiving, I'd have at least expected a good film, if not a great one. Brokeback Mountain might pretend it's a good film, but it definitely isn't. In fact, it's been done much better before. I should have avoided this mess and seen Rent for the fourth time instead!",2,One of the most overrated films EVER!,1136160000,"01 2, 2006",2006,2726,"['Brokeback', 'Mountain', 'far', 'most', 'disappointing', 'film', 'year', 'glowing', 'reviews', 'are', 'flowing', 'major', 'magazine', 'major', 'critic', 'friends', 'kept', 'telling', 'how', 'amazing', 'was', 'how', 'beautiful', 'how', 'achingly', 'real', 'boyfriend', 'headed', 'theatre', 'excited', 'ready', 'be', 'amazed', 'audience', 'applauded', 'once', 'film', 'was', 'over', 'boyfriend', 'were', 'relieved', 'did', ""n't"", 'go', 'longer.The', 'film', 'slowly', 'way', 'too', 'long', 'not', 'problem', 'main', 'problem', 'film', 'tries', 'be', 'so', 'artsy', 'two', 'second', 'scenes', 'excruciating', 'shots', 'nature', 'never', 'audience', 'chance', 'know', 'characters', 'main', 'love', 'story', 'two', 'men', 'lovers', 'never', 'fleshed', 'out', 'never', 'understood', 'what', 'drew', 'together', 'why', 'had', 'long', 'lasting', 'relationship', 'ever', 'see', 'do', 'fish', 'herd', 'sheep', 'wrestle', 'topless', 'skinny', 'dip', 'have', 'very', 'rough', 'sex', 'found', 'really', 'offensive', 'stereotype', 'did', 'not', 'notice', 'love', 'two', 'men', 'animal', 'lust', 'more', 'it.The', 'story', 'such', 'mess', 'important', 'characters', 'are', ""n't"", 'even', 'introduced', 'good', 'third', 'way', 'film', 'storylines', 'are', 'wrapped', 'up', 'way', 'too', 'quickly', '1963', '45', 'minutes', 'could', 'have', 'easily', 'been', 'cut', 'down', '15', 'rest', '20', 'years', 'story', 'place', 'flashes', 'what', 'sake', 'seeing', 'sheep', 'herders', 'not', 'cowboys', 'way', 'do', 'job', 'take', 'break', 'eat', 'can', 'beans', 'ten', 'shots', 'sheep', 'flocking', 'too', 'many', 'scenes', 'do', 'nothing', 'advance', 'story', 'instead', 'make', 'film', 'tedious', 'almost', 'unbearable', 'time', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'used', 'flesh', 'out', 'cardboard', 'characters', 'instead.I', ""'ll"", 'give', 'Brokeback', 'Mountain', 'one', 'praise', 'amazing', 'talented', 'cast', 'Jake', 'Gyllenhal', 'Heath', 'Ledger', 'are', 'quite', 'good', 'Michelle', 'Williams', 'terrific', 'long-suffering', 'wife', 'might', 'be', 'clich', 'eacute', 'most', 'fleshed', 'out', 'most', 'real', 'character', 'film', 'Anne', 'Hathaway', 'great', 'actress', 'almost', 'wasted', 'brief', 'role', 'are', 'Anna', 'Farris', 'Linda', 'Cardellini', 'almost', 'cameo', 'roles', 'definitely', 'could', 'have', 'used', 'fleshing', 'out', 'deleting', 'altogether', 'rest', 'scenes', 'were', 'doubt', 'deleted', 'make', 'room', 'more', 'shots', 'nature', 'sheep', 'topless', 'wresting', 'scenes', 'two', 'men.To', 'say', 'BrokeBack', 'Mountain', 'disappointing', 'not', 'enough', 'praise', 'receiving', ""'d"", 'have', 'least', 'expected', 'good', 'film', 'not', 'great', 'one', 'Brokeback', 'Mountain', 'might', 'pretend', 'good', 'film', 'definitely', ""n't"", 'fact', 'been', 'done', 'much', 'better', 'should', 'have', 'avoided', 'mess', 'seen', 'Rent', 'fourth', 'time', 'instead']",N/A
172651,AAYE34TCTNV2R,1417030321,MarlowesMom,"[11, 11]","SPOILER ALERT""Brokeback Mountain"" is one of the most affecting, beautiful movies I've ever seen. It's beyond Western, it's beyond romance, it's beyond gay cinema, although it has elements of all of these things. It's simply great cinema. Every aesthetic and technical detail is superb, making the elegiac pace not just bearable but enjoyable. Jake Gyllenhaal excels as Jack Twist; his performance only suffers by comparison to Heath Ledger's anguished genius as Ennis Del Mar (which means, fittingly, ""island in the sea""). Michelle Williams and Anne Hathaway do fine work as Ennis and Jack's wives respectively.""Brokeback Mountain""'s tragedy is specific to its time, place and characters. It is about the oppression and marginalization of gay men in small-town America in the early 1960s. In that time and place, no gay person would ever dare to ""come out."" Jack at least understands who he is. The viewer never doubts that Jack is a closeted gay man. Although he marries and has a child (as did many gay men in that era, including members of my family), during his and Ennis's many lengthy separations, Jack picks up gay prostitutes in Mexico and reaches out to another man to determine if he too might be gay. It's strongly hinted that Jack is killed because he dares to follow his true nature. Jack's tragedy is that he is a gay man in the wrong place and time.Ennis is the character who is ""locked down"" in a more universal way and therefore brings the film to its more universal tragedy. Ennis liked school but was unable to graduate due to dire family circumstances. He has an indelible childhood memory of seeing a rancher suspected of homosexuality tortured and killed and the fear never leaves him. Although Jack suggests that he and Ennis leave and go to a big city or start a ranch together somewhere, Ennis is trapped by his limitations, his fears,  other people's expectations, and his own expectations. He stays in his bleak home town, marries his high school girlfriend, and has two daughters, stuck forever in material and emotional poverty. Unlike Jack, there is no suggestion that Ennis is attracted to any man other than Jack. In fact, after his divorce, Ennis dates another woman, but things don't work because he's so shut down emotionally. Whatever Ennis's clinical sexual orientation may be, Jack is the love of Ennis's life, as we see from the exquisite scene at the end of the movie where Ennis, in his lonely trailer, cries over his and the now-dead Jacks' shirts, together on the same hanger, and Willie Nelson's ""He Was a Friend of Mine"" plays over the closing credits. Ennis's is the tragedy of the person or any race or sexual orientation at any time in history whose combination of life circumstances and personality prevent him or her from living an authentic and rewarding life.""Brokeback Mountain"" is that rare treasure of a movie that engages you emotionally, makes you think, and is at the artistic pinnacle of the filmmakers' art and craft. Of course it did not win the Best Picture Academy Award. That distinction went to the superficial ""Crash."" No matter.

The impact of this impossible love on their further lives is laid bare in agonizing detail, resulting in a heartbreakingly poignant conclusion that leaves not a single winner. Those who prefer happy endings are well advised to stay away, though they will be the poorer for it.The brilliant opening scene has you riveted right away. The main protagonists appear in the shot, yet all there is is silence. It takes ages for anyone to say anything, and when the first full sentence is spoken it is by neither of the boys, but by the man they are seeking a job from. It is typical of the film: enormous suspense and terrific emotional charges build up through silence and lack of action. The smallest gestures and the tiniest, mumbled phrases gain huge significance: Ennis squatting naked in the background, washing himself, and Jack in the foreground, very actively NOT looking. If you don't have an eye for such detail, this movie will mean nothing to you. If you do, the characters will speak to you in an unprecedented way, and you'll even find an occasional tongue in cheek joke adding some comic relief to this tragic story (e.g., Jack driving a tractor of the 'Versatile' brand). In this context, the few emotional and aggressive outbursts of course pack a tremendous punch.And then there is the sheer beauty of the images. The sweeping landscapes of Wyoming (actually Alberta, Canada) lend a Walt-Whitmanesque power to the relationship of the two men, and heighten the contrast with the hideous little towns where they conduct their obligatory marriages - which after a promising start recede into joyless dreariness, until, as Jack puts it, they can be conducted over the phone. Prieto's cinematography is simply breathtaking, and a random collection of frames from this film would make a great photobook.The lead actors carry the movie, and take the skill of acting to new heights. From Gyllenhaal this is no surprise, as he had already proven himself to be an actor of extraordinary calibre and versatility. His Jack Twist, notwithstanding his obvious imperfections, is instantly loveable, and his descent into increasing anger and bitterness painful to watch. It is, however, Ledger's performance that is the big surprise and the crowning glory of this film. Author Annie Proulx observed that he understood Ennis's character better than she herself did, and if ever an actor got under the skin of his character, it is here. His Ennis is like a coiled-up spring, the tremendous tension inside palpable throughout. Ledger certainly has come a long way, and more than makes up for silly excursions like 'The Brothers Grimm'. Interestingly, in a way he comes full circle with the start of his acting career, when he appeared in an Australian teen soap as a cyclist on a sports academy, struggling to come to terms with his homosexuality. Michelle Williams and Anne Hathaway also give sterling performances as the tormented wives. Alma's Thanksgiving outburst and even more Lureen's telephone conversation with Ennis are acting feats of rare power - it is impossible to think of Hathaway returning to ""Princess Diaries"" after this, though apparently she will. Roberta Maxwell appears only briefly as Jack's mother, yet projects so much intensity into her few lines and all her facial expressions that you feel you could write a novel about the woman.Hollywood has come a long way in finally admitting a film like this to the mainstream. All the fuss surrounding it remains shocking, though; rightwing zealots and ""christian"" bishops would have you believe you're in for some gay hardcore flick, but BBM actually contains no more than the barest minimum of necessary man-on-man lovescenes. In comparison to straight-themed movies (or even to the straight lovescenes in BBM itself), there is still a long way to go.It is even more shocking that the will and the courage were still lacking to award BBM the ultimate prize it so very clearly deserved - some Academy members, like good old Tony Curtis (didn't we see him in a dress once?) refusing to even view it, thus further devaluating the meaning of the Oscar system.

Then there was either something wrong my ears, or my sound, cos Jake Gyllenhall & Heath Ledger seemed to mumble all their lines! It got very annoying, and I kept turning the sound up 'til nearly as far as it would go. Then the sex scenes are actually filmed in nearly complete darkness, so it's very difficult to see what actually is going on, but it's also very well done. But then they just seem to be sleeping, and the next thing you know is one is jumping on the other ... you know the rest.I quite liked both Jake & Heath in this, apart from the constant smoking, and the rest of the actors in this are amazing. Michelle Williams, playing a dowdy character for once in her life, is simply amazing as Ennis' on screen wife (and off screen), the scene where she discovers her husband's betrayal will bring a lump to anyone's throat, although it's implied in her previous scenes that she knows. Anne Hathaway takes her first major step away from The Princess Diaries & Ella Enchanted, by playing a bit of a cow, and doing her first blink-and-you'll-miss-it topless scene. Randy Quaid & Anna Faris also appear in this, as unrecognisable characters, I didn't actually realise it was them until reading the cast list.There is no other love story like this out there, and can play itself out without much in the way of dialogue, apart from half way through. Heath & Jake both took a major risk getting involved with this film, but they both pulled it off with little embarrassment. Ang Lee and all actors didn't shy away from the material put in front of them, they got on and did it and pulled out an unforgettable film.The ending is heartbreaking, and unforgettable, but also unpredictable. I did not see this coming. The almost final shots of their shirts together, and a postcard of Brokeback Mountain.This is a very hard film to review, second only to United 93.

Ledger perfectly brings a gruff, quiet Ennis to the screen with explosive results and Williams has blossomed into a pitch perfect actress potraying Ennis's tortured wife and proves she has come a long way since Dawson's creek. i have loved Ang Lee's films from Sense and Sensibilty to Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon but this by far is his best film to date, i wont give away the ending but i will say the shirt...just makes you want to cry. some people may shy away from the film but its a great film so i definently recomend seeing it. it is truley the best film of the year.",5,th best film of the year,1141689600,"03 7, 2006",2006,1768,"['i', 'have', 'agree', 'Brokeback', 'got', 'robbed', 'oscars', 'definently', 'one', 'biggest', 'upsets', 'when', 'Shakespear', 'Love', 'won', 'excpected', 'Saving', 'Private', 'Ryan', 'why', 'film', 'lost', 'i', 'can', 'speculate', 'prejudice', 'theme', 'late', 'night', 'jokes', 'have', 'seen', 'comedy', 'central', 'when', 'came', 'out', 'i', 'guess', 'academy', 'wasent', 'ready', 'film', 'adressing', 'gay', 'theme', 'take', 'home', 'most', 'prestigous', 'film', 'award', 'can', 'look', 'bright', 'side', 'year', 'two', 'will', 'forget', 'Crash', 'victory', 'Brokeback', 'will', 'only', 'gain', 'popularity', 'will', 'become', 'classic', 'other', 'robbed', 'oscar', 'films', 'film', 'sad', 'tone', 'when', 'pictures', 'happiness', 'just', 'heartbreaking', 'film', 'two', 'ranchers', 'Ennis', 'Jack', 'who', 'meet', 'one', 'summer', 'tending', 'sheep', 'wilderness', 'Brokeback', 'Mountain', 'fate', 'fall', 'love', 'then', 'time', 'buy', 'get', 'married', 'have', 'kids', 'still', 'always', 'meet', 'mountain', 'rekindle', 'there', 'love', 'performences', 'are', 'great', 'Gyllenhaal', 'best', 'performence', 'Good', 'Girl', 'Hathaway', 'far', 'Princess', 'diaries', 'days', 'two', 'standout', 'performces', 'are', 'Ledger', 'Williams', 'Ledger', 'perfectly', 'gruff', 'quiet', 'Ennis', 'screen', 'explosive', 'results', 'Williams', 'blossomed', 'pitch', 'perfect', 'actress', 'potraying', 'Ennis', 'tortured', 'wife', 'come', 'long', 'way', 'Dawson', 'creek', 'i', 'have', 'loved', 'Ang', 'Lee', 'films', 'Sense', 'Sensibilty', 'Crouching', 'Tiger', 'Hidden', 'Dragon', 'far', 'best', 'film', 'date', 'i', 'wont', 'give', 'away', 'ending', 'i', 'will', 'say', 'shirt', 'just', 'want', 'cry', 'people', 'may', 'shy', 'away', 'film', 'great', 'film', 'so', 'i', 'definently', 'recomend', 'seeing', 'truley', 'best', 'film', 'year']",N/A

FUSCO ""yawnmower""","[46, 55]","One of the truly great American films has been made by a Chinese director, an Argentinian composer, and an Australian lead actor.Ang Lee has captured the loneliness, intolerance, and violence of the American west as no one else has. There may be a few tiny false notes, mostly in plot devices fleshing out the short story, but Mr. Lee has created an intimate, genuine, masterful, epic film which portrays a region, time, and two star-crossed lovers who find each other in 1963.The film follows their passionate, private, and devoted friendship for 20 years. Jake Gyllenhaal is extraordinary as rodeo cowboy Jack Twist, who begins as a sweet, soft-spoken, sensuous young man, and grows into a loving, self-assured man who knows what he wants.  Heath Ledger paints a deeply moving portrait of the taciturn ranch hand Ennis Del Mar, whose still waters run very deep, indeed.  Yet he cannot satisfy anyone -- himself least of all. Torment is etched on his face, but can be verbalized only in extreme circumstances.  His passive/aggressive character triggers all the major and minor tragedies of this multi-level, heart-breaking story.The musical score is gorgeous, and perfectly complements the magnificent photography and scenery. Be sure to watch the credits, because Rufus Wainright's beautifully simple accompanying song sums up the entire film with remarkable sentiment and heartfelt aplomb.",5,study in loneliness,1146441600,"05 1, 2006",2006,1392,"['One', 'truly', 'great', 'American', 'films', 'been', 'made', 'Chinese', 'director', 'Argentinian', 'composer', 'Australian', 'lead', 'actor.Ang', 'Lee', 'captured', 'loneliness', 'intolerance', 'violence', 'American', 'west', 'one', 'else', 'may', 'be', 'few', 'tiny', 'false', 'notes', 'mostly', 'plot', 'devices', 'fleshing', 'out', 'short', 'story', 'Mr.', 'Lee', 'created', 'intimate', 'genuine', 'masterful', 'epic', 'film', 'region', 'time', 'two', 'star-crossed', 'lovers', 'who', 'find', 'other', '1963.The', 'film', 'passionate', 'private', 'devoted', 'friendship', '20', 'years', 'Jake', 'Gyllenhaal', 'extraordinary', 'rodeo', 'cowboy', 'Jack', 'Twist', 'who', 'sweet', 'soft-spoken', 'sensuous', 'young', 'man', 'loving', 'self-assured', 'man', 'who', 'what', 'Heath', 'Ledger', 'deeply', 'moving', 'portrait', 'taciturn', 'ranch', 'hand', 'Ennis', 'Del', 'Mar', 'still', 'waters', 'run', 'very', 'deep', 'indeed', 'can', 'not', 'satisfy', 'anyone', 'least', 'Torment', 'etched', 'face', 'can', 'be', 'verbalized', 'only', 'extreme', 'circumstances', 'passive/aggressive', 'character', 'triggers', 'major', 'minor', 'tragedies', 'multi-level', 'heart-breaking', 'story.The', 'musical', 'score', 'gorgeous', 'perfectly', 'magnificent', 'photography', 'scenery', 'Be', 'sure', 'watch', 'credits', 'Rufus', 'Wainright', 'beautifully', 'simple', 'accompanying', 'song', 'sums', 'entire', 'film', 'remarkable', 'sentiment', 'heartfelt', 'aplomb']",N/A
172667,A1TJPMB7N776WS,1417030321,MICHAEL ACUNA,"[1658, 1818]","Love has no rules. It happens  when we least expect it, often when we don't want it, many times when we can't handle it. It often times scares you, surprises you, shakes you down to your very core. Ennis Del Mar (a remarkable Heath Ledger) and Jack Twist (an emotionally available Jake Gyllenhaal) find themselves thrown together because of a job:  forced to spend many hours together alone in the wild, tending to sheep in a remote region of Wyoming....on Brokeback Mountain. They fall in love: a love that they soon realize only lives and breathes on the mountain.It's 1963, pre American involvement in the Vietnam War, post Korean War: a time in the USA when life was simple, straightforward and the lines between the sexes and sex roles were crisply drawn and severely delineated. It was a time when men and women were pigeon-holed into unrealistic modes of behavior and anyone who ventured outside of these boundaries was thought of at best, weird at worst... perverted and in many states, criminal. Ennis himself, at an early age was witness to the ugly, disgusting results of a hate crime perpetrated on a Wyoming farmer who had lived many years with his partner. In most societies he would be venerated but in 1950's Wyoming... he became a target.Director Ang Lee begins this film as both Ennis and Jack are waiting outside of a building, both looking for work, both down on their luck, both avoiding each other's eyes. We know, or those of us who have read the story know, what is to happen and so unfortunately we read more into that simple scene than there really is. But with all that aside, this scene of Ennis and Jack avoiding each other, dodging each others looks, staring at the ground, kicking up the dirt is nonetheless rife with sensuality and tension.Ennis and Jack are inexorably drawn to each other through their proximity, loneliness and through a shared lack of tenderness and emotion in their lives: they are emotionally, physically and psychically bonded almost from the start. It is inevitable. It is Fate.And so begins a Love affair that transcends social mores, time, marriages, children, extra-marital affairs and divorce.Despite all that is going on in their lives, Ennis and Jack meet several times a year up on Brokeback mountain  and  rekindle and thereby re-ignite their emotional and physical attraction: there is no one around, they are free from their regular lives...they can love.Much has been made of Heath Ledger's performance as Ennis and he gives what is without a doubt one of the finest performances of this year. Ennis is a quiet, stoic man and he is troubled and frankly scared by how deeply he feels for Jack. As he showed us first in ""Monster's Ball,"" Ledger is capable of digging way deep down into his gut and imbuing his performances with an unflinching frankness and truth that we can neither ignore nor help to be moved by.Gyllenhall's Jack is the younger of the two: he's fun, he's a little crazy and unfortunately he wants a lot, lot more than Ennis is able to give him. Gyllenhaal's hang-dog, frisky puppy of a performance is full of warmth and light: the kind of transcendent light that shines out from a soul full of love, understanding and acceptance.""Brokeback Mountain"" is devastating in both its presentation, its performances and its tragic denouement. This movie is not for everyone. But if you are willing to open up your heart and mind a bit to let in its beauty, emotionality and sensuality you will not be disappointed.

Along the way they make love to one another in which case Ennis says he isnt that way. They dont want anyone else to know about it so they keep it a secret. Ennis' wife Alma Del Mar is played by the wonderful Michelle Williams (The Baxter, Dawson's Creek). They have a daughter as well. Jack falls in love with rodeo girl Lureen Newsome played by cutie Anne Hathaway (Havoc, Princess Diaries 1 & 2). They have a son together. Jack gets in contact with Ennis and the two of them spend time fishing which is what they do but also their love for each other grows. Alma right away discovers the secret hiding and bottling it up inside of her all throughout. I ignore the bad reviews and snippy remarks and the jokes and just watch the movie and I thought it was pretty good for what it is. Heath Leger (Lords of Dogtown, Casanova) and Jake Gyllenhaal (Donnie Darko, Jarhead) give superb performances. The scene in which Gyllenhaal yells at his step-father to sit down was a great scene...I was waiting for Gyllenhaal to deck that guy. I had to put subtitles on half way for Ledger because some times he'd talk real low and I couldnt understand what he said but I got it all. Do I think it was snubbed at Oscar time? Uh, it was but I did liked Crash. The cinematography is great.

This was a beautifully filmed movie and a joy to watch from that standpoint, but it was also overlong and very slowly paced and offered no real character motivation or development. Brokeback Mountain is based on a 20-page short story, and I learned more about the characters in those 20 pages than I did in this two plus hour movie and that bothered me. The other thing that bothered me about the movie was while it took place over the course of nearly 20 years, there were really no visible signs of aging in the two main characters. Longer sideburns and a mustache on Jack and that was supposed signify the passage of time?In the short story it's very clear why Ennis is so hesitant to pursue his relationship with Jack and I really think they needed to do more in the movie to make that information known than the thirty seconds they gave it. For whatever reason, they decided that information wasn't important, or maybe they wanted us to try and come to our own conclusions, but as a result, the tragedy of the love story is completely lost along with all the social issues surrounding their relationship. I can't deny the movie was emotional, but I think with some character motivation it could have been much more that it was. It could have been a love story that was remembered for the relationship between the two principle characters. As it stands now, it will be remembered, but only because it dared to deal with a taboo topic and that's not only unfortunate, but insulting.I thought Heath Ledger was very good in the movie and I think he deserved the Oscar nomination. After seeing the movie I wouldn't have been unhappy had he actually won, but maybe that's based more on my bias of rewarding actors with Oscars for doing impersonations in movies, as opposed to acting a character. Jake Gyllenhaal proved to me that he's nothing but an average actor who's yet to move beyond his work in Bubble Boy.Brokeback Mountain wasn't a bad movie, but it also wasn't a very good movie, or a movie that made a lot of sense and I think most of the attention it received was because of hype. Too bad, because, as I mentioned earlier, with some character development and motivation this could have been a really good love story.I understand how the movie won the Oscar for best screenplay from previously published material since the writers had to take a 20 minute short story and convert it into a 2 hour and 10 minute movie.I recommend Brokeback Mountain only to someone interested in seeing beautiful cinematography.",2,"Beautifully filmed, but overlong and very slow - read the short story instead",1297641600,"02 14, 2011",2011,2570,"['beautiful', 'cinematography', 'enough', 'make', 'movie', 'was', 'beautifully', 'filmed', 'movie', 'joy', 'watch', 'standpoint', 'was', 'also', 'overlong', 'very', 'slowly', 'paced', 'offered', 'real', 'character', 'motivation', 'development', 'Brokeback', 'Mountain', 'based', '20-page', 'short', 'story', 'learned', 'more', 'characters', '20', 'pages', 'did', 'two', 'hour', 'movie', 'bothered', 'other', 'thing', 'bothered', 'movie', 'was', 'took', 'place', 'course', 'nearly', '20', 'years', 'were', 'really', 'visible', 'signs', 'aging', 'two', 'main', 'characters', 'Longer', 'mustache', 'Jack', 'was', 'supposed', 'signify', 'passage', 'time', 'short', 'story', 'very', 'clear', 'why', 'Ennis', 'so', 'hesitant', 'pursue', 'relationship', 'Jack', 'really', 'think', 'needed', 'do', 'more', 'movie', 'make', 'information', 'known', 'thirty', 'seconds', 'gave', 'reason', 'decided', 'information', 'was', ""n't"", 'important', 'maybe', 'wanted', 'try', 'come', 'own', 'conclusions', 'result', 'tragedy', 'love', 'story', 'completely', 'lost', 'social', 'issues', 'surrounding', 'relationship', 'ca', ""n't"", 'deny', 'movie', 'was', 'emotional', 'think', 'character', 'motivation', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'much', 'more', 'was', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'love', 'story', 'was', 'remembered', 'relationship', 'two', 'principle', 'characters', 'now', 'will', 'be', 'remembered', 'only', 'dared', 'deal', 'taboo', 'topic', 'not', 'only', 'unfortunate', 'insulting.I', 'thought', 'Heath', 'Ledger', 'was', 'very', 'good', 'movie', 'think', 'deserved', 'Oscar', 'nomination', 'seeing', 'movie', 'would', ""n't"", 'have', 'been', 'unhappy', 'had', 'actually', 'won', 'maybe', 'based', 'more', 'bias', 'rewarding', 'actors', 'Oscars', 'doing', 'impersonations', 'movies', 'opposed', 'acting', 'character', 'Jake', 'Gyllenhaal', 'proved', 'nothing', 'average', 'actor', 'who', 'yet', 'move', 'work', 'Bubble', 'Boy.Brokeback', 'Mountain', 'was', ""n't"", 'bad', 'movie', 'also', 'was', ""n't"", 'very', 'good', 'movie', 'movie', 'made', 'lot', 'sense', 'think', 'most', 'attention', 'received', 'was', 'hype', 'Too', 'bad', 'because', 'mentioned', 'earlier', 'character', 'development', 'motivation', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'really', 'good', 'love', 'story.I', 'understand', 'how', 'movie', 'won', 'Oscar', 'best', 'screenplay', 'previously', 'published', 'material', 'writers', 'had', 'take', '20', 'minute', 'short', 'story', 'convert', '2', 'hour', '10', 'minute', 'movie.I', 'recommend', 'Brokeback', 'Mountain', 'only', 'someone', 'interested', 'seeing', 'beautiful', 'cinematography']",N/A

Masterpeice is not too strong a word.The one point that the film makes, and I think has been lost in all the ""gay hoopla"", is the collateral damage in the lives of the people forced to live as someone they are not. Look at the families of the two lead characters.  Both suffered immeasurably because of the lie their husbands/fathers were forced to live. I would tell the religious right and anyone who wants gay people to fake their lives by pretending to be straight to consider the others in the equation.

Perhaps I'm a little intimidated by this film and a little nervous at summarizing it for the Amazon community.  Nonetheless, here is my tardy entry.Jack and Ennis (two teenage ranch hands) meet by chance and work together in the most rough and unforgiving of environments, tending to and herding sheep in the mountains of Wyoming one summer.  To their great surprise (and to the surprise of their boss,) they develop a physical and (eventually) emotional love for each other that neither had experienced before (and neither probably will again.)This film chronicles their attempts to exist in the ""real world,"" i.e. the ""straight"" world, with each of their wives and children, as they struggle to define and sustain their relationship with each other through the years.If you can't fall in love, just a little, with either Jack or Ennis (or both,) this film won't probably affect you much.  I am struck by how much more I was moved by this film on the big screen.  But on DVD, the whole is still there; you just have to pay attention a little more and thankfully use the volume and rewind buttons (which aren't available in the theater.)  It's a study in love and courage, relationships, expectations, and society.  Love lands where it wants.I cannot remember a film which has inspired so much need in me to visit endless chat sites and the movie site, watch the trailer ceaselessly, buy BBM ""merchandise"" on eBay.  Though this is not a happy film, there are moments of overwhelming and intense joy that carry you through the sadness and melancholy and make the journey worthwhile.I would not dare to voice any criticism of this film, but would only comment that the lack of clarity in some of the dialog, particularly Ennis, makes for a frustrating experience at times.  (Thorough discussions of the dialog in question can be found on the Internet.)  Probably the most satisfying explanations are found in one's own heart.

Ofarrell ""irish mike""","[34, 40]","Hats off to director Ang Lee, screen writers Larry McMurtry and Diana Ossana, a brilliant ensemble cast and the superb technical crew that contributed to the making of one of the greatest American films of the past quarter century. Now that the recent, disgraceful Academy Awards ceremony is history, the legacy of ""Brokeback Mountain' will begin to grow in the aftermath of unbelievable stupidity on the part of card-carrying A.M.P.A.S. members.""Brokeback Mountain"" is too great a movie to be merely tagged with ""The Academy Award Winning Best Picture"" label, a distinction that carries less and less weight, it seems to me, with each passing year. The amount of detritus picked as ""Best Picture"" in Oscar's past is truly staggering, so in a way ""Brokeback Mountain"" has received a backhanded compliment from ""The Academy"". The film joins an impressive list of magnficant losers: ""The Grapes Of Wrath"", ""Citizen Kane"", ""The Treasure Of The Sierra Madre"", ""A Place In The Sun"", ""High Noon"", ""Giant""....the list goes on and on.""Brokeback Mountain' did manage to win three well deserved Oscars. Ang Lee's direction is brilliant, bringing alive a 20 year saga with the resonance of an epic novel. McMurty and Ossana's adaptation of Annie Proulx's eloquent short story is a model of craft, enriching the original tale with embellishments to characters and plot only hinted at in the source material. Gustavo Santaollala's original music score adds further power to the proceedings with plaintive themes and melodies evoking love and loss in the big wide open spaces. Last but not least, Rodrigo Prieto's stunning cinematography (which lost to ""Memoirs Of A Geisha"") surrounds the viewer in a world both majestic (those picturesque mountain pastures) and mundane ( drab Texas towns and  weathered Wyoming ranches).There were other fine movies released in 2005. In fact, three of the Best Picture nominees from that year are likely to endure in the years to come. ""Capote"". ""Good Night, and Good Luck"" and ""Munich"" were superb films. However, ""Brokeback Mountain"" was far and away the most striking movie of 2005.

172674,A23DWPG5UMSXKF,1417030321,"Michael Smith ""saintzak""","[19, 44]","I think Brokeback Mountain has been transformed into something well beyond a movie. People either kneel before it lavishing uwarrented praise or villify it in the most degrading and hateful terms. But it really is just a movie.Coco Channel famously said, ""Never add. Take away."" Brokeback Mountain was based on Annie Proulx's short story...SHORT story. How it ended up a movie well in excess of 2 hours is a mystery to me. It feels padded and bloated. Proulix used such spare language that she kept her story in brutal focus. The movie loses its way. The beginning scenes and the ending scenes are dead on. The look, the feel...they fit Proulix's original material like a glove. Its the vast middle section where things go very wrong. So much material has been added and embellished concerning the two men's marriages and wives that their relationship with each other becomes background. The movie becomes more a study of the failed marriages than an exploration of their profound bond. That element played as a tragic backdrop in the original story. The tragedy of these two men carried mysery in its wake. In some ways I felt we learned more about the wives than the cowboys in this film. The mid section becomes kind of ponderous and slow.When Ang Lee succeeds he does so greatly. The entire early part is excellent. From the opening seconds when the two men first see each other the attraction is unmistakable. Their ""romance"" is not treated in typical Hollywood style of guazy close-ups, longing eyes and trembling lips. Its very real and natural, told in subtle posing, stolen glances, gradual opening up and fear of making that first move. After that first move has been made Ennis and Jack seem completely natural and comfortable with each other. Its very real. Jump ahead to the end, and it once again finds its heart. A paunchy, middle-aged Jack bitterly confronting Ennis with all the ""what ifs"" and ""we should haves"" that their lives have come down to is very effective and sets up the sad and dismal end very well. Wisely the end is also not treated in typical Hollywood fashion. Ennis' visit with Jack's parents is a study in things not spoken. The end is certainly depressing and profoundly sad, but never resorts to sentimental Hollywood tearjerking. Its a very raw and honest finish. Lee never presents us with a typical villain who embodies the prejudice and bigotry. It pervades the whole movie like a smothering force. Lee keeps an emotional distance and seems to simply point his camera at a very sad story. The approach makes it very universal.The performances are wonderful. Heath Ledger certainly deserves all the praise he's gotten. He completely disappears in this role and the effect is amazing. Jake Gyllenhaal is also excellent. Michelle Williams as Ennis' wife is very effective, but Anne Hathaway is pretty weak. Randy Quaid is great in his small role and while he illustrates bigotry and contempt perfectly he never turns into a cartoon. Roberta Maxwell and Peter McRobbie as Jack's parents are wonderful. He can barely contain his disgust and disappointment. She is a study in heartbreak and hidden understanding.If 30 minutes had been cut out of the mid section this would have been an excellent movie.",3,Its only a movie,1135641600,"12 27, 2005",2005,3236,"['think', 'Brokeback', 'Mountain', 'been', 'transformed', 'something', 'well', 'movie', 'People', 'kneel', 'lavishing', 'uwarrented', 'praise', 'villify', 'most', 'degrading', 'hateful', 'terms', 'really', 'just', 'movie.Coco', 'Channel', 'famously', 'said', 'Never', 'add', 'Take', 'away', 'Brokeback', 'Mountain', 'was', 'based', 'Annie', 'Proulx', 'short', 'story', 'SHORT', 'story', 'How', 'ended', 'up', 'movie', 'well', 'excess', '2', 'hours', 'mystery', 'padded', 'bloated', 'Proulix', 'used', 'such', 'spare', 'language', 'kept', 'story', 'brutal', 'focus', 'movie', 'way', 'beginning', 'scenes', 'ending', 'scenes', 'are', 'dead', 'look', 'feel', 'fit', 'Proulix', 'original', 'material', 'glove', 'vast', 'middle', 'section', 'where', 'things', 'go', 'very', 'wrong', 'So', 'much', 'material', 'been', 'added', 'embellished', 'concerning', 'two', 'men', 'marriages', 'wives', 'relationship', 'other', 'becomes', 'movie', 'more', 'study', 'failed', 'marriages', 'exploration', 'profound', 'bond', 'element', 'played', 'tragic', 'backdrop', 'original', 'story', 'tragedy', 'two', 'men', 'carried', 'mysery', 'wake', 'ways', 'felt', 'learned', 'more', 'wives', 'cowboys', 'film', 'mid', 'section', 'kind', 'ponderous', 'slow.When', 'Ang', 'Lee', 'so', 'greatly', 'entire', 'early', 'part', 'excellent', 'opening', 'when', 'two', 'men', 'first', 'see', 'other', 'attraction', 'unmistakable', 'romance', 'not', 'treated', 'typical', 'Hollywood', 'style', 'guazy', 'close-ups', 'longing', 'eyes', 'trembling', 'lips', 'very', 'real', 'natural', 'told', 'subtle', 'posing', 'stolen', 'glances', 'gradual', 'opening', 'up', 'fear', 'making', 'first', 'move', 'first', 'move', 'been', 'made', 'Ennis', 'Jack', 'seem', 'completely', 'natural', 'comfortable', 'other', 'very', 'real', 'Jump', 'ahead', 'end', 'once', 'again', 'heart', 'paunchy', 'middle-aged', 'Jack', 'bitterly', 'confronting', 'Ennis', 'what', 'ifs', 'should', 'haves', 'lives', 'have', 'come', 'down', 'very', 'effective', 'up', 'sad', 'dismal', 'end', 'very', 'well', 'Wisely', 'end', 'also', 'not', 'treated', 'typical', 'Hollywood', 'fashion', 'Ennis', 'visit', 'Jack', 'parents', 'study', 'things', 'not', 'spoken', 'end', 'certainly', 'depressing', 'profoundly', 'sad', 'never', 'resorts', 'sentimental', 'Hollywood', 'tearjerking', 'very', 'raw', 'honest', 'finish', 'Lee', 'never', 'typical', 'villain', 'who', 'prejudice', 'bigotry', 'whole', 'movie', 'smothering', 'force', 'Lee', 'emotional', 'distance', 'simply', 'point', 'camera', 'very', 'sad', 'story', 'approach', 'very', 'universal.The', 'performances', 'are', 'wonderful', 'Heath', 'Ledger', 'certainly', 'praise', 'gotten', 'completely', 'role', 'effect', 'amazing', 'Jake', 'Gyllenhaal', 'also', 'excellent', 'Michelle', 'Williams', 'Ennis', 'wife', 'very', 'effective', 'Anne', 'Hathaway', 'pretty', 'weak', 'Randy', 'Quaid', 'great', 'small', 'role', 'bigotry', 'contempt', 'perfectly', 'never', 'cartoon', 'Roberta', 'Maxwell', 'Peter', 'McRobbie', 'Jack', 'parents', 'are', 'wonderful', 'can', 'barely', 'contain', 'disgust', 'disappointment', 'study', 'heartbreak', 'hidden', 'understanding.If', '30', 'minutes', 'had', 'been', 'cut', 'mid', 'section', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'excellent', 'movie']",N/A

Having sat through hundreds of variations on My Best Friend's Wedding or some other 'chick flick' with both straight female friends and gay male friends, I can honestly say that this film has been a lifetime in coming for me.  I suppose that if you're not a gay man you can't relate to this very important point, but after a lifetime of having to rewrite hundreds of movies in my head after leaving the theater to dream what it would be like to see a movie about love between two men, especially one starring two headlining straight men, it is a seminal moment.This is not a chick flick; there are no dashing leading men and there is no clearly defined happily-ever-after.. but what there IS is the indelible impression of the hell-and-back reality that many thousands of gay men have gone through while traveling the slow road to acceptance.  40+ years after the story in this movie started, the journey continues.

First the good - this film is beautifully shot. You'll enjoy the scenery of the mountain locations, and Ang Lee even makes Texas attractive. The acting is good- there may be some Academy nominations for the leads. The sexual couplings are graphic but not pornographic, along with the language and some violence, earning the R rating.The story and setting is also very true to mid-20th-century rural life. The braggadicio, poverty, social strictures and prejudices are all there. These characters live on the knife-edge of patriotism, straight-laced religion and rebellion from it, and all the soul-shattering hypocrisy that results. And it's very 'white' - minorities are relegated to the periphery. Having lived through a similar upbringing it all rang uncomfortably true.But unlike UNFINISHED LIFE, there are no lessons learned here. No forgiveness given. No reconciliation - just the spectacle of social norms broken and lives ruined all around. If you think this is anti-gay bias, do what I did - Substitute a female for one of the male leads, and you'll see this is one of several 'love affair' movies like AMERICAN BEAUTY that detail the desperation of loveless marriages and the devastation that follows from straying from them. The love depicted here may be 'true', but it is also VERY selfish, just as all extramarital affairs are. Watch the look on one wife's face as she realizes the truth. See her pain!

Moore,"[6, 16]","I love Annie Proulx's original story of ""Brokeback Mountain"" more than any other piece of contemporary literature, and I wanted to love Ang Lee's film as much as I love the story. I do like the film a lot, and Heath Ledger and Jake Gyllenhaal embody Ennis and Jack magnificently; they give two of the greatest, most courageous and most moving performances in any recent American film. Yet, in my opinion, the film doesn't quite deserve the highest rating. Larry McMurtry and Diana Ossana write wonderful dialogue, and McMurtry unquestionably knows more about how cowboys act, talk and think than any other living author, with the possible exception of Proulx. Yet, in expanding Proulx's story for the screen, McMurtry and Ossana add some not-very-interesting new characters, and make some slight but annoying changes to the original that dilute its impact. (Their screenplay is indeed beautiful and tear-inducing, but Proulx's original leaves readers with their guts ripped out.) As for Lee's direction, he obviously is a masterful director of actors; every performance is perfect, and Michelle Williams equals Ledger and Gyllenhaal as Ennis' wife Alma, a nice, beleaguered young woman who discovers her husband's secret in a way no woman could ever forgive. Lee also captures some heartbreakingly beautiful scenes of the Rockies and Great Plains with the help of his superb photographer, Rodrigo Prieto. But he lingers too long on those scenes, so that a film that should have been a punchy, concentrated 90 minutes drags on for two-and-a-quarter hours. The basic story, however, still gets under our skin in a way few stories ever do, and Ledger and Gyllenhaal (as stated before) can't be faulted in any way. Ledger is particularly impressive as an archetypal cowboy--hot-blooded but emotionally reticent, quicker with his fists than his tongue--who finds himself drawn into a love that everything in his previous experience tells him is a death sentence. Gyllenhaal, with his puppy-dog eyes and lopsided grin, makes us feel his character's ardent emotional needs with touching immediacy. I just wish the film as a whole was as great as they are. The relevance of ""Brokeback Mountain,"" however, could not be clearer: even as all America is weeping over the plight of Ennis and Jack, the Virginia legislature--marching in lockstep with Ohio and other states--just voted overwhelmingly to ban same-sex marriage within the commonwealth. I wish I could find out who the hypocrites are--the delegates who voted for the ban while pretending to have been moved by this film.",4,"Wonderful in many ways, but not quite what it could have been.",1136764800,"01 9, 2006",2006,2569,"['love', 'Annie', 'Proulx', 'original', 'story', 'Brokeback', 'Mountain', 'more', 'other', 'piece', 'contemporary', 'literature', 'wanted', 'love', 'Ang', 'Lee', 'film', 'as', 'much', 'love', 'story', 'do', 'film', 'lot', 'Heath', 'Ledger', 'Jake', 'Gyllenhaal', 'embody', 'Ennis', 'Jack', 'magnificently', 'give', 'two', 'greatest', 'most', 'courageous', 'most', 'moving', 'performances', 'recent', 'American', 'film', 'opinion', 'film', ""n't"", 'quite', 'deserve', 'highest', 'rating', 'Larry', 'McMurtry', 'Diana', 'Ossana', 'write', 'wonderful', 'dialogue', 'McMurtry', 'unquestionably', 'more', 'how', 'cowboys', 'act', 'talk', 'think', 'other', 'living', 'author', 'possible', 'exception', 'Proulx', 'expanding', 'Proulx', 'story', 'screen', 'McMurtry', 'Ossana', 'add', 'not-very-interesting', 'new', 'characters', 'make', 'slight', 'annoying', 'changes', 'original', 'impact', 'screenplay', 'indeed', 'beautiful', 'tear-inducing', 'Proulx', 'original', 'readers', 'guts', 'ripped', 'out', 'Lee', 'direction', 'obviously', 'masterful', 'director', 'actors', 'performance', 'perfect', 'Michelle', 'Williams', 'equals', 'Ledger', 'Gyllenhaal', 'Ennis', 'wife', 'Alma', 'nice', 'beleaguered', 'young', 'woman', 'who', 'husband', 'secret', 'way', 'woman', 'could', 'ever', 'forgive', 'Lee', 'also', 'heartbreakingly', 'beautiful', 'scenes', 'Rockies', 'Great', 'help', 'superb', 'photographer', 'Rodrigo', 'Prieto', 'too', 'long', 'scenes', 'film', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'punchy', 'concentrated', '90', 'minutes', 'drags', 'two-and-a-quarter', 'hours', 'basic', 'story', 'however', 'still', 'skin', 'way', 'few', 'stories', 'ever', 'do', 'Ledger', 'Gyllenhaal', 'stated', 'ca', ""n't"", 'be', 'faulted', 'way', 'Ledger', 'particularly', 'impressive', 'archetypal', 'cowboy', 'hot-blooded', 'emotionally', 'reticent', 'quicker', 'fists', 'tongue', 'who', 'drawn', 'love', 'everything', 'previous', 'experience', 'tells', 'death', 'sentence', 'Gyllenhaal', 'puppy-dog', 'eyes', 'lopsided', 'grin', 'feel', 'character', 'ardent', 'emotional', 'needs', 'touching', 'immediacy', 'just', 'wish', 'film', 'whole', 'was', 'as', 'great', 'are', 'relevance', 'Brokeback', 'Mountain', 'however', 'could', 'not', 'be', 'clearer', 'even', 'America', 'weeping', 'plight', 'Ennis', 'Jack', 'Virginia', 'legislature', 'marching', 'lockstep', 'Ohio', 'other', 'states', 'just', 'voted', 'overwhelmingly', 'ban', 'same-sex', 'marriage', 'commonwealth', 'wish', 'could', 'find', 'out', 'who', 'hypocrites', 'are', 'delegates', 'who', 'voted', 'ban', 'pretending', 'have', 'been', 'moved', 'film']",N/A

Of course, such scandal was to be expected, because if there's a stereotype more traditional and almost sacred in the United States, is the rude and very masculine cowboy.The western is a genre associated with a misogynistic point of view, always related with iconic figures such as Clint Eastwood and the very macho John Wayne; so, from this limited scoop, it's not rare that Brokeback Mountain put itself in the eye of a storm.Based on a short novel written by Annie Proulx, the movie narrates the story between two men for almost twenty years. When they meet in the 60's, Ennis (Heath Ledger) and Jack (Jake Gyllenhaal) are two young kids hired to watch a herd of sheep. Ennis is the quiet, shy one, engaged to marry Alma (Michelle Williams) and Jack is the free-spirited one, always happy, optimistic and a first-class dreamer. In Brokeback Mountain, both men surrender their souls to a forbidden love, and after doing this, they return to their routines, hoping to put behind a life-changing experience that would chase them forever.The years pass, and Jack and Ennis have their very decent and normal families. Until one day, they meet again. And this meeting marks the turbulent, painful and harrowing beginning of a prohibited and irregular relationship, with devastating consequences.Social prejudices, hypocritical morals, intolerance an narrow minds are some of the obstacles that Ennis and Jack's love must endure. The other obstacle, the worst, is their battle with themselves. Jack, more open and clear about what he wants, what happiness means to him, is more willing to make choices that will cost him, but he'll do them anyway. Ennis is more cautious, in part because he's incapable of admit who he really is, what are his true feelings, always afraid of what people will think, afraid of rejection, afraid of speak freely about his emotions.And here is where Brokeback Mountain succeeds. It's not an ordinary movie about two guys having sex or making out. It's a movie about a love that aspires, above everything, the freedom to love without censorship; a love that seeks respect, dignity and the opportunity to be lived at its fullest. Director Ang Lee has beautifully crafted one of the greatest love stories of all times, one that will transcend its characters. Slow, with a gorgeous cinematography and a paused tone, Brokeback Mountain is simply a moving and tragic tale of two secret lovers; and these lovers could very well be heterosexual. But then, who would find this original and interesting?",5,A tender story of a prohibited love,1148342400,"05 23, 2006",2006,2688,"['cinematographic', 'achievements', 'Brokeback', 'Mountain', 'have', 'been', 'buried', 'controversy', 'generated', 'argument', 'homosexual', 'relationship', 'two', 'cowboys', 'course', 'such', 'scandal', 'was', 'be', 'expected', 'stereotype', 'more', 'traditional', 'almost', 'sacred', 'United', 'States', 'rude', 'very', 'masculine', 'cowboy.The', 'western', 'genre', 'associated', 'misogynistic', 'point', 'view', 'always', 'related', 'iconic', 'figures', 'such', 'Clint', 'Eastwood', 'very', 'macho', 'John', 'Wayne', 'so', 'limited', 'scoop', 'not', 'rare', 'Brokeback', 'Mountain', 'put', 'eye', 'storm.Based', 'short', 'novel', 'written', 'Annie', 'Proulx', 'movie', 'story', 'two', 'men', 'almost', 'twenty', 'years', 'When', 'meet', '60', 'Ennis', 'Heath', 'Ledger', 'Jack', 'Jake', 'Gyllenhaal', 'are', 'two', 'young', 'kids', 'hired', 'watch', 'herd', 'sheep', 'Ennis', 'quiet', 'shy', 'one', 'engaged', 'marry', 'Alma', 'Michelle', 'Williams', 'Jack', 'free-spirited', 'one', 'always', 'happy', 'optimistic', 'first-class', 'dreamer', 'Brokeback', 'Mountain', 'men', 'surrender', 'souls', 'forbidden', 'love', 'doing', 'return', 'routines', 'hoping', 'put', 'life-changing', 'experience', 'would', 'chase', 'forever.The', 'years', 'pass', 'Jack', 'Ennis', 'have', 'very', 'decent', 'normal', 'families', 'one', 'day', 'meet', 'again', 'meeting', 'turbulent', 'painful', 'harrowing', 'beginning', 'prohibited', 'irregular', 'relationship', 'devastating', 'consequences.Social', 'prejudices', 'hypocritical', 'morals', 'intolerance', 'narrow', 'minds', 'are', 'obstacles', 'Ennis', 'Jack', 'love', 'must', 'endure', 'other', 'obstacle', 'worst', 'battle', 'Jack', 'more', 'open', 'clear', 'what', 'what', 'happiness', 'more', 'willing', 'make', 'choices', 'will', 'cost', ""'ll"", 'do', 'anyway', 'Ennis', 'more', 'cautious', 'part', 'incapable', 'admit', 'who', 'really', 'what', 'are', 'true', 'feelings', 'always', 'afraid', 'what', 'people', 'will', 'think', 'afraid', 'rejection', 'afraid', 'speak', 'freely', 'emotions.And', 'here', 'where', 'Brokeback', 'Mountain', 'not', 'ordinary', 'movie', 'two', 'guys', 'having', 'sex', 'making', 'out', 'movie', 'love', 'everything', 'freedom', 'love', 'censorship', 'love', 'respect', 'dignity', 'opportunity', 'be', 'lived', 'fullest', 'Director', 'Ang', 'Lee', 'beautifully', 'crafted', 'one', 'greatest', 'love', 'stories', 'times', 'one', 'will', 'transcend', 'characters', 'Slow', 'gorgeous', 'cinematography', 'paused', 'tone', 'Brokeback', 'Mountain', 'simply', 'moving', 'tragic', 'tale', 'two', 'secret', 'lovers', 'lovers', 'could', 'very', 'well', 'be', 'heterosexual', 'then', 'who', 'would', 'find', 'original', 'interesting']",N/A

172685,A3UPYGJKZ0XTU4,1417030321,mirasreviews,"[12, 76]","""Brokeback Mountain"" is based on a short story by E. Annie Proulx about two men who, young and poor, meet in 1963 when they tend a herd of sheep for the summer on Wyoming's Brokeback Mountain. Ennis Del Mar (Heath Ledger) is laconic, introverted and plans to marry shortly. Jack Twist (Jake Gyllenhaal) is an outgoing rodeo jock, estranged from his family, who dreams of better things. Isolated and increasingly attracted by their mutual differences, the two men have a passionate affair. When the summer is over, Ennis marries his sweetheart Alma (Michelle Williams), and they start a family. Jack moves up in the world by marrying Lureen (Anne Hathaway), the rebellious daughter of a well-to-do farm equipment distributor in Texas. Ennis and Jack see one another sporadically over the next couple of decades on fishing trips where they rekindle their relationship, and Jack becomes increasingly frustrated with Ennis' resignation that their association can never be more than occasional and secretive.""Brokeback Mountain"" is a story of cowboys, but it is not a ""Western"" genre film. It's an ""epic love story"" genre film in the sense of being a stock story of 2 people who fall in love in their youth and are kept apart by social conventions. We've all seen this plot a thousand times, but ""Brokeback Mountain"" fails to convince as either ""epic"" or ""love story"". Annie Proulx's short story is intimate and focused. The material isn't suitable for an epic. The film doesn't have the production values to pull it off anyway. The 1.85:1 format doesn't flatter the Wyoming landscapes, and attempts at grand vistas undermine the core tension in the plot. As to the love story, I don't see it. There is no chemistry between Ennis and Jack and no evidence of undying love. Ennis and Jack seem like buddies who get the hots for one another now and again. Their fishing trips come across simply as nostalgia for a time when they were young and happy, not stolen moments of desperate love. There is nothing wrong with that. In fact, the short story gives the same impression. But it's clearly not what the film's screenwriters or director intended.The filmmakers intended a love story with a message (so they've said). For that, the actors needed help from the editor and cinematographer. The short story has no such agenda. Annie Proulx's story succeeds precisely because it focuses on the intimate relationship between these 2 men to the exclusion of everything else. The film shows us a lot of open spaces and wide angles. Poorly chosen lenses and landscapes make it difficult, if not impossible, for Jack and Ennis' alleged frustration and desperation to come through. Poorly chosen cuts and excessive length dilute the main storyline. Forty-five minutes should and could easily have been cut from the film to focus its emotions. Screenwriters Larry McMurtry and Diana Ossana intended to ""flesh out"" Annie Proulx's story. But instead they stretched it out and watered it down with extraneous material. Alma, who is a credible, embittered character in the short story, has been made weak and weepy. Her acrimony is transferred to Lureen. Ennis comes across simply as someone who can't decide what he wants, and Jack as someone who always wants things that are out of reach. The trouble is that the movie is about two men deeply in love. Supposedly. ""Brokeback Mountain"" is excessively long, unfocused, and unconvincing.The DVD (Universal 2006): There are 4 featurettes. ""On Being a Cowboy"" (6 min) includes interviews with the cast, director Ang Lee, stunt coordinator, and animal wranglers on how the actors learned to ride and rope. ""Directing from the Heart: Ang Lee"" (8 min) includes interviews with the cast, producers, and cinematographer in which they speak about Ang Lee. Lee himself talks about the film's dramatic themes. In ""From Script to Screen: Interviews with Larry McMurtry and Diana Ossana"" (11 min), the screenwriters talk about adapting Annie Proulx's story, which takes up only half of the screenplay. No kidding. (A bit of sarcasm there.) ""Sharing the Story: The Making of Brokeback Mountain"" (20 min) is a ""Logo Movie Special"" documentary made for television about making the film, from preparing the actors to filming in Canada, to audience reactions.

The acting is too strong, the writing is too perceptive, the direction is too smart and the cinematography is too spare and beautiful to just flow away into indifference.  Director Ang Lee pulls off one hell of a love story that transcends sexuality.  It's about two people who truly fall in love.  One summer Ennis Del Mar (Heath Ledger) and Jack Twist (Jake Gyllenhaal) meet in the Wyoming Mountains to herd sheep, a job both expect little out of.  What they don't anticipate is that both share deep commanalities, such as broken homes and dreams of a better life.  What they really don't expect is too fall for each other.  Both leave the mountain, and eventually continue on with their lives the way society has told them to.  Ennis marries his sweetheart Alma (Michelle Williams) and Jack marries a rodeo chick (Anne Hathaway), but neither of them finds the happiness that they felt with each other that special, innocent summer.  Jack eventually finds the bravery to push for what he wants, but Ennis, closed-off and emotionally inexperienced (Ledger gives a performance of epic emotional intensity), can't bring himself to acknowledge what he knows, whether it is love for Jack or his paternal need to be with his daughters.  And he learns too late what it is he really wants.Both Heath Ledger and Jake Gyllenhaal are emotional knockouts and the actors who beat them for the Oscars had better have given superhuman efforts to best them.  You don't find two performances like these just anywhere.  The same goes for Michelle Williams and Anne Hathaway, who hit grace notes that almost any other actor would have overlooked.  Credit director Ang Lee for obsessively scanning the small things that make a good actor great, and a good movie a classic.  A movie about gay cowboys it may be, but it's the humanity and love between Ennis and Jack that make ""Brokeback Mountain"" universal.

You either understand its message and like it, think it's okay but not outstanding, or are totally turned off. Opinion and diversity makes the world what it is and Brokeback Mountain shows us another part of the world that many people still, unfortunately, want kept in the closet.Annie Proulx's purpose was to expose homophobia in that time and place. Heath Ledger did an excellent job of internalizing his character's homophobia. Only those who have been there can truly appreciate the depth presented here.Homophobia destroys not only the person who is homophobic but all those around them, family, friends, and as so brilliantly and vividly portrayed by Jake Gyllenhaal, their lovers too.This movie gained wider appeal also due to its message of unrequited love. Anyone who has ever experienced lost opportunity for love can identify. An emotionally powerful film.Highly recommended!However, I docked 1 star due to Ang Lee's lame attempt to make this beautiful film more acceptable to a wider audience by cutting out the male nudity that made the film distracting and feel less natural than the short story.Even after that, there was high political motivation for the film's R rating. This fine film should have been rated no higher than PG or PG-13 at most. It's R-rating is a pure political rating with absolutely no basis in fact from the CARA's own rules for ratings.Jake Gyllenhaal did a much better job for an actor in a supporting role than did George Clooney in Syriana. Another AMPAS snuff at a politically controversial film.Those who say that the lack of a Best Film Oscar or Best Supporting Actor Oscar were not due to Hollywood's well-known homophobia are naive or just plain stupid. Well known actors have been in the closet since the birth of Hollywood and continue to influence its peer voting to this very day.I cannot recommend the Special Edition released on Jan 23. It appears to be a case of ""double-dipping"" by the production company as there is little, if anything, new on this version.

Next thing you know, one of my closest guy friends comes up to me and asks me if I had ever seen it. Without hesitation, I replied: ""Yes, and it is one of the greatest romantic movies I have ever seen."" His response to that was basically saying the same thing.I'm sure by this point, 8 years after the film's release, the vast majority of you know the story so I'll just cut to the review.During the course of watching this movie, I sat completely still. The only movement was the blinking of my eyes. At some points, I grew so intrigued that I forgot how to breathe. Sitting through the forbidden romance was heartbreaking and painful. After the movie was over, I couldn't even reach 2 feet over to grab the remote. I just sat on the couch hypnotically watching the credits scroll with a blank stare. After managing to turn off the TV, I went up to my bedroom and sat on the edge of the bed, staring at the wall. A moment later, a wave of sadness swept over me like a blanket. I was stunned. The acting is terrific (R.I.P. Heath Ledger), the atmosphere is almost as depressing as the movie itself, and the soundtrack definitely has a few perks to it. However, the ending was somewhat expected (all great romances end in tragedy) and in some ways, a little dull. Brokeback Mountain is one of the movies you can watch once, but always remember. A key element that I feel is excessively upsetting is that neither Ennis (Heath Ledger) or Jack (Jake Gyllenhaal) ever admit their true orientation to anyone else in the story and deny the fact that they are gay or possibly bi. I am a huge fan of the movies that bring out the emotions which are buried deep within, and this movie gets an A+ in that perspective. Hollywood has done the LGBT community a great favor with this one. Ever since I first watched it last week, I have shown it to quite a few people who also ended up loving it!

172697,A2IDH9KN7OBGJW,1417030321,"Movie Buff ""patrickcat""","[37, 45]","This movie is about a love affair between two ranch hands in 1963 Wyoming.  They take jobs watching over sheep up on Brokeback Mountain.  Ennis Del Mar (Heath Ledger) and Jack Twist (Jake Gyllenhaal) are the two.  There's not a lot of dialogue in the beginning between them, but there is a chemistry that is obvious to all.  After a night of drinking, Ennis decides he can't make it back to check the sheep so he decides to sleep it off there outside of Jack's tent.  Ennis begins to audibly shiver as the cold of the night sets in.  Jack hearing this invites him in to his tent.  Later on as Jack awakes after pulling Ennis' hand around himself, they both are a bit uncomfortable at first but Jack then takes the initiative and they end up having sex.  After that neither one wants to speak too much about it but they have this understanding.  After the job is cut short due to the weather, at least that's what they are told, they split ways and end up leading their separate lives, both eventually getting married and having children.  They then continue their affair on a more frequent baisis over the years.  Each telling their wives they are going away with a fishing buddy.  That's the basic story.  I won't tell anymore.  I really recommend you see this film.  Chances are if you've taken the time to read this you will enjoy the film.All the acting was amazing, but Heath Ledger and Jake Gyllenhaal were both outstanding.  I think it's time for some Oscars for this one.  The directing by Ang Lee was stellar as usual.  It is just a beautiful film.I knew this was going to be a tragic love story from what I'd heard and even the previews gave it away.  So I decided to brace myself and try to enjoy it.  Well it left me in tears which a lot of movies do, but even more it has stayed with me.  I saw it about 6 hours ago and I'm still feeling down.  This is not a knock against the movie, in fact it explains how deeply moving the movie is.  It's going to make me enjoy my life and the things I have a little more than I did yesterday.  I would imagine everyone will take a little something different from this movie but I think it will affect a lot of people, hopefully in a positive way.Before I saw the movie I was talking to a friend who said they were saying on the radio that it's not a gay movie, but a ""country"" movie.  I'll admit the word gay was never uttered during the movie.  I think I understand what they are trying to say, but in my mind it was gay.  Don't get me wrong, not like ""Torch Song Trilogy"" (great movie), but let's face it, it's about two men in love in an age and a place where that was not an option.",5,Breakthrough Film,1134172800,"12 10, 2005",2005,2637,"['movie', 'love', 'affair', 'two', 'ranch', 'hands', '1963', 'Wyoming', 'take', 'jobs', 'watching', 'sheep', 'up', 'Brokeback', 'Mountain', 'Ennis', 'Del', 'Mar', 'Heath', 'Ledger', 'Jack', 'Twist', 'Jake', 'Gyllenhaal', 'are', 'two', 'not', 'lot', 'dialogue', 'beginning', 'chemistry', 'obvious', 'night', 'drinking', 'Ennis', 'ca', ""n't"", 'make', 'back', 'check', 'sheep', 'sleep', 'Jack', 'tent', 'Ennis', 'audibly', 'shiver', 'cold', 'night', 'sets', 'Jack', 'hearing', 'tent', 'Later', 'Jack', 'awakes', 'pulling', 'Ennis', 'hand', 'are', 'bit', 'uncomfortable', 'first', 'Jack', 'then', 'initiative', 'end', 'up', 'having', 'sex', 'one', 'speak', 'too', 'much', 'have', 'understanding', 'job', 'cut', 'short', 'due', 'weather', 'least', 'what', 'are', 'told', 'split', 'ways', 'end', 'up', 'leading', 'separate', 'lives', 'eventually', 'getting', 'married', 'having', 'children', 'then', 'continue', 'affair', 'more', 'frequent', 'baisis', 'years', 'telling', 'wives', 'are', 'going', 'away', 'fishing', 'buddy', 'basic', 'story', 'wo', ""n't"", 'tell', 'anymore', 'really', 'recommend', 'see', 'film', 'Chances', 'are', ""'ve"", 'taken', 'time', 'read', 'will', 'enjoy', 'film.All', 'acting', 'was', 'amazing', 'Heath', 'Ledger', 'Jake', 'Gyllenhaal', 'were', 'outstanding', 'think', 'time', 'Oscars', 'one', 'directing', 'Ang', 'Lee', 'was', 'stellar', 'usual', 'just', 'beautiful', 'film.I', 'knew', 'was', 'going', 'be', 'tragic', 'love', 'story', 'what', ""'d"", 'heard', 'even', 'previews', 'gave', 'away', 'decided', 'brace', 'try', 'enjoy', 'Well', 'left', 'tears', 'lot', 'movies', 'do', 'even', 'more', 'stayed', 'saw', '6', 'hours', 'ago', ""'m"", 'still', 'feeling', 'down', 'not', 'knock', 'movie', 'fact', 'how', 'deeply', 'moving', 'movie', 'going', 'make', 'enjoy', 'life', 'things', 'have', 'little', 'more', 'did', 'yesterday', 'would', 'imagine', 'everyone', 'will', 'take', 'little', 'something', 'different', 'movie', 'think', 'will', 'affect', 'lot', 'people', 'hopefully', 'positive', 'way.Before', 'saw', 'movie', 'was', 'talking', 'friend', 'who', 'said', 'were', 'saying', 'radio', 'not', 'gay', 'movie', 'country', 'movie', ""'ll"", 'admit', 'word', 'gay', 'was', 'never', 'uttered', 'movie', 'think', 'understand', 'what', 'are', 'trying', 'say', 'mind', 'was', 'gay', 'Do', ""n't"", 'get', 'wrong', 'not', 'Torch', 'Song', 'Trilogy', 'great', 'movie', 'let', 'face', 'two', 'men', 'love', 'age', 'place', 'where', 'was', 'not', 'option']",N/A

172699,A1O42HTIVMHVD9,1417030321,Movie Man,"[39, 49]","Saw this six times in the theater and have seen it twice on DVD.  Obsessive?  Perhaps, but the repeated viewings speak to the power of the film.  I have never before been so mesmerized by a movie.  For me, ""Brokeback"" touched on painful experiences, memories and fears in a way that no other art-work ever has.  Like other positive reviewers, I can only offer thanks to Ang Lee, the producers, and the cast.On the big screen, I can't find any flaw with the film. Strengths include the obvious majesty of the landscapes and the cinematography that capture it. The characters are entirely credible and are given exquisite nuances by both the script and the actors. For better or for worse, I recognize and have experienced some of the conflicts and situations depicted in the film and have been overwhelmed by the emotional accuracy that the ensemble has been able to depict.  Two days after the first viewing, I had to shut the office door as I involuntarily burst into tears.  ""Brokeback"" had broken down my own walls of constraint and self-serving amnesia.I have heard criticisms that there is not enough ""passion"" depicted between the two male leads, and that some viewers don't believe that the two were in love.  Some have even said that the early parts of the film, where our two leads get to know each other, are slow or even boring.  Most, if not all, of the people that I have heard saying this have been straight males.  They are entitled to their opinion, but I suspect that their view is colored by the fact that they have never fallen in love with a male. Anyone who has--a female, a gay male, or even a straight male who has experienced a crush on a buddy--can feel the admiration and deep love that is communicated between the two leads, both in their silence and in the consummately ""male"" banter.  Whereas some may sit and wonder why in the early film we see so much time spent on Brokeback Mountain, I suspect that anyone who has fallen for a male understands the why all too well.  The early film brilliantly and efficiently captures the shift between Ennis and Jack from indifference, to trust, to ""the love the dared not express its name."" This dynamic is different from what might transpire between a male and a female, precisely because the very possibility of the transformation was unanticipated (at least by Ennis);  whereas any interaction between a male and female has an implicit possibility for romance or sex, what we witness in the early film is the emergence of something that had heartofore not been imagined (again, at least in the case of Ennis.  Jack's situation is a bit more ambiguous).  Mapping that transformation is what the early film was about, and Lee did so brilliantly.  We see the characters making furtive glances at each other.  We witness the break-through when Ennis speaks ""more than he has in the last year.""  We see the consummation of the relationship, and the anger, confusion, and even hate that result from it.  It's the dynamic of becoming aware of unknown feelings, a dynamic that is even different from what might transpire  between two open, more emotionally demonstrative gay males.  But the love, sometimes exhilerating, sometimes crushing, was palpable and brilliantly portrayed.  It is the very maleness in the leads' taciturn expression and activities that the two admired in each other and which, for some viewers, makes the leads so attractive.The rest of the film is right on target.  The leads' subterfuge that does not fool family members, the pain felt by the wronged wives and girlfriend, the struggle for both characters to find the love that they need in a world that forbids them it, and at the end, the devastating feeling of having missed a major opportunity in life---all of this is well done.On a small screen, the DVD fails to capture the grandness of the early part of the film, and in this failure there is a consequent loss of cinematographic poetry.  I suspect that viewers with ultra-sophisticated TV equipment will get far more out of the DVD than people using dinosaur equipment.I am not one prone to drammatic statements and emotional pronouncements.  Against this disclaimer, I will add that this movie has deeply affected me.  Through it, I have been able to talk about issues that I never before have raised with many straight friends.  More importantly, many straight friends have broached topics and concerns with me that they never before ever gave thought to.  Many gay friends who are more comfortable in their sexuality than I am have, too.

I watched it with an open mind and found it to be a beautifully filmed, heart wrenching film.  Most already know the gist of it so I won't dwell on it (I won't mention how it ends) but it is about a rodeo rider and a ranch hand (Jack Twist and Ennis Del Mar) who get hired to herd sheep on Brokeback Mountain in 1963.  They begin a relationship there which, at first, appears violent but, in the next love scene, looks very tender.Twist (played by the very handsome Jake Gyllenhaal) wants to start a life with his new friend but the reticent Del Mar (he mumbles as if he has marbles in his mouth--actually he reminds me a little of Boomhower from King of the Hill in terms of sometimes not being able to understand what he is saying)) does not believe it will ever work due to a horrible sight he had as a kid of the corpse of a man who was in a homosexual relationship beaten and dragged to death by a hate-filled gang which included, perhaps, Del Mar's father.  Del Mar (played by Heath Ledger) had plans to marry and both men do marry and have families of their own but are never really happy.  Twist is married to a cold woman and is despised by his father-in-law.  Del Mar's wife witnessed her husband and Twist kissing which created an unspoken resentment that led to the marriage failing.  The only happiness the men have is the occasional times they return to their hidden companionship and love life on Brokeback Mountain.  Even these good times are hampered by the fact that they must return to their lonely lives in the outside world.I think there was a lot more tenderness between the men that could have been shown.  So much of their time together includes harsh words and physical violence.  Such love is revealed when Twist admits to his friend, ""The truth is, sometimes I miss you so much I can hardly stand it.""  Another review used the word ""understated,"" and I think that is an excellent description of the film.  However understated it is, it had me crying at the end.The scenery of Brokeback Mountain is beautiful and the film does an excellent job aging the characters as the film progresses through 20 years.  It is 2 hours and 15 minutes and, though it is not particularly fast-moving, it is interesting enough to hold one's attention throughout.  The extras (i.e. ""The Making of.."") are very well-done although there is a lot of the predictable praising between actors.  I don't know if it is the type of film I could watch numerous times, but it does make me want to read the short story which inspired it.",5,"""So, what we got now is Brokeback Mountain, everything's built on that, that's all we got!""---Jack Twist",1200700800,"01 19, 2008",2008,2647,"['checked', 'out', 'movie', 'see', 'what', 'controversy', 'was', 'about', 'being', 'butt', 'pun', 'lot', 'jokes', 'watched', 'open', 'mind', 'found', 'be', 'beautifully', 'filmed', 'heart', 'wrenching', 'film', 'Most', 'already', 'know', 'gist', 'wo', ""n't"", 'dwell', 'wo', ""n't"", 'mention', 'how', 'rodeo', 'rider', 'ranch', 'hand', 'Jack', 'Twist', 'Ennis', 'Del', 'Mar', 'who', 'get', 'hired', 'herd', 'sheep', 'Brokeback', 'Mountain', '1963', 'begin', 'relationship', 'first', 'violent', 'next', 'love', 'scene', 'very', 'tender.Twist', 'played', 'very', 'handsome', 'Jake', 'Gyllenhaal', 'start', 'life', 'new', 'friend', 'reticent', 'Del', 'Mar', 'marbles', 'mouth', 'actually', 'little', 'Boomhower', 'King', 'Hill', 'terms', 'sometimes', 'not', 'being', 'able', 'understand', 'what', 'saying', 'not', 'believe', 'will', 'ever', 'work', 'due', 'horrible', 'sight', 'had', 'kid', 'corpse', 'man', 'who', 'was', 'homosexual', 'relationship', 'beaten', 'dragged', 'death', 'hate-filled', 'gang', 'included', 'perhaps', 'Del', 'Mar', 'father', 'Del', 'Mar', 'played', 'Heath', 'Ledger', 'had', 'plans', 'marry', 'men', 'do', 'marry', 'have', 'families', 'own', 'are', 'never', 'really', 'happy', 'Twist', 'married', 'cold', 'woman', 'despised', 'father-in-law', 'Del', 'Mar', 'wife', 'witnessed', 'husband', 'Twist', 'kissing', 'created', 'unspoken', 'resentment', 'led', 'marriage', 'failing', 'only', 'happiness', 'men', 'have', 'occasional', 'times', 'return', 'hidden', 'companionship', 'love', 'life', 'Brokeback', 'Mountain', 'Even', 'good', 'times', 'are', 'hampered', 'fact', 'must', 'return', 'lonely', 'lives', 'outside', 'world.I', 'think', 'was', 'lot', 'more', 'tenderness', 'men', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'shown', 'So', 'much', 'time', 'together', 'harsh', 'words', 'physical', 'violence', 'Such', 'love', 'revealed', 'when', 'Twist', 'friend', 'truth', 'sometimes', 'miss', 'so', 'much', 'can', 'hardly', 'stand', 'review', 'used', 'word', 'understated', 'think', 'excellent', 'description', 'film', 'However', 'understated', 'had', 'crying', 'end.The', 'scenery', 'Brokeback', 'Mountain', 'beautiful', 'film', 'excellent', 'job', 'aging', 'characters', 'film', '20', 'years', '2', 'hours', '15', 'minutes', 'not', 'particularly', 'fast-moving', 'interesting', 'enough', 'hold', 'one', 'attention', 'extras', 'i.e', 'Making', 'of..', 'are', 'very', 'well-done', 'lot', 'predictable', 'praising', 'actors', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'type', 'film', 'could', 'watch', 'numerous', 'times', 'make', 'want', 'read', 'short', 'story', 'inspired']",N/A

I didn't really enjoy it much because, to put it plainly, it bored me to death. The movie drags on at a realistically paced soap opera. I admit the acting was decent and the story was alright, but it was really boring. I would definitely not watch this again, even on a boring rainy day with green eggs and ham.Problems:1. The plot of the movie isn't really complex. I won't say it since it'll spoil it for you.2. The love scenes and love relationship in general feels more like a fetish reenactment or a spare the moment ""I haven't gotten any for a long time"" kind of thing. The love never really hits a believable level where you're like ""yeah, they really care for each other even without the sex"". Sex is the limit of their love. I know the movie tries to portray it differently but come on now every time they meet there's always some sexual encounter. They never really build their relationship much past that point.3. The movie was extremely static and slow paced. If I was ever to be tortured, watching this movie again would probably be the finishing move.....4. Have anyone noticed that the characters don't really change physically even though they said it's been about 20 years or so? In the end when BLANK met his daughter, the daughter almost looked like his wife, the dad and the daughter looked almost the same age!5. No satisfactory conclusion. I guess that's how it works in real life but again it goes back to the pretty static plot. You would think that there's some sort of better resolve in the end, but it just feels like the whole moral of the movie was ""love sucks, don't get into it or you'll be like US (echo effect).I was seriously bored out of my mind. I just thought there would be something that would make this movie more rewatchable or rather....watchable at all. It just bored me to death. I'm very open to different types of movies, but yeah...My thoughts are: I think the only reason this movie got so much attention and overexaggeration is because of one single thing. HEATH LEDGER.

172707,A2959PY4ZOCXOH,1417030321,Nick,"[34, 40]","""Brokeback Mountain"" was the most nominated film this year in the Academy Awards with eight nominations, including the coveted categories of ""Best Picture,"" ""Best Actor,"" ""Best Supporting Actor,"" ""Best Supporting Actress,"" and ""Best Director."" ."" To much shock and upset, it failed to win ""Best Picture"" at the Academy Awards, an honor which it earned in almost every other major motion picture award show it was nominated for, marking it as one of the biggest snubs in Academy Award history. However, it did take home Oscar wins in the following three categories: ""Best Director,"" ""Best Adapted Screenplay"" and ""Best Original Score."" The movie itself has also gathered rave reviews by both major and local critics respectively. The New York Times gives it a remarkable grade of 100%, leaving some of the year's other top films, such as ""Capote"" behind at 90%. The film is a personal story of two brave young men, Ennis Del Mar, a ranch hand played brilliantly by Heath Ledger, and Jake Gyllenhaal gives a stellar performance as Jack Twist, a rodeo Texan cowboy. Ennis Del Mar is a character who is tortured, sensitive, taciturn who talks with a clenched fist expression and fails to look anybody straight in the eye. Jack Twist on the other hand is more open and gregarious character, willing to build a long lasting relationship with Ennis Del Mar, in which he fails repeatedly due to the rough time period the tale takes place. These two men unexpectedly fall in love in the summer of 1963, while sheepherding in the grasslands and mountainous terrain of Wyoming, which are clearly depicted through the film's mesmerizing pastoral cinematography. When the summer is over each man is faced with a painful decision of taking a separate path, which leads to both men getting married, having children and raising their own families. However, they still manage to keep in touch through mail and they visit frequently. In one of those visits, Alma Del Mar played stunningly by Michelle Williams, the woman who Ennis Del Mar marries and has two daughters with, comes to a startling revelation upon seeing her husband in a compromising position with Jack Twist outside her household, knowing that her husband cannot love her in return. Anne Hathaway equally excels in her portrayal of Lureen Newsome, the wife of Jack Twist who bears his only son, in a role that is more mature and far more different than her role in the previously known 2001 Blockbuster hit that made her famous, The Princess Diaries. The two men keep their secretive relationship ongoing for a twenty year period and the actors do very well in aging their characters, whether it is through the use of makeup, growing facial hair or deepening the voices and strengthening their accents. The movie's cliff hanger ending and soaring musical score is bound to haunt and puzzle viewers for a long time to come, with a bone-chilling effect that commences immediately after the film's screening, leaving viewers in awe and goosebumps. Overall, Heath Ledger delivers one of the best performances in the history of modern cinema as Ennis Del Mar; it is characterized as an ""acting miracle"" and critics have rightfully rated it equal to the greatest performances of actors Marlon Brando and Sean Penn respectively. Brokeback Mountain is an epic movie that really tugs at the heartstrings filled with drama, adventure, passion, sorrow, mystery, suspense, concealment, resentment, heartbreak, hardship, betrayal with a presence of several elements of humor and wit. The acting performances by the cast members are all superb, done with maximum soul on their part. Honestly, although I was initially hesitant to see this movie when it was originally released due to its controversial subject matter however, I'm really glad I did. Contrary to being labeled and parodied as a ""gay cowboy movie,"" after a couple of scenes the characters' sexual orientation becomes ambiguous, since although they differ from other individuals in that aspect they are still part of the human race, struggling to make a decent living in 1963 Wyoming. The movie lives up to its theme that love is nothing but a force of nature. I was blown away and found it to be one of the most powerful, touching and melancholic movies I have ever seen in my life. This movie is a must see for any individual that has an open mind, who is not offended by some scenes that depict violence,  strong language and some brief nudity, and generally any individual willing to see an overall well crafted movie. I give it ""two thumbs up.""",5,"THE EPIC OF ""BROKEBACK MOUNTAIN"" IS A CINEMATIC MASTERPIECE!!!",1144627200,"04 10, 2006",2006,4546,"['Brokeback', 'Mountain', 'was', 'most', 'nominated', 'film', 'year', 'Academy', 'Awards', 'eight', 'nominations', 'including', 'coveted', 'categories', 'Best', 'Picture', 'Best', 'Actor', 'Best', 'Supporting', 'Actor', 'Best', 'Supporting', 'Actress', 'Best', 'Director', 'much', 'shock', 'upset', 'failed', 'win', 'Best', 'Picture', 'Academy', 'Awards', 'honor', 'earned', 'almost', 'other', 'major', 'motion', 'picture', 'show', 'was', 'nominated', 'marking', 'one', 'biggest', 'snubs', 'Academy', 'Award', 'history', 'However', 'did', 'take', 'home', 'Oscar', 'following', 'three', 'categories', 'Best', 'Director', 'Best', 'Adapted', 'Screenplay', 'Best', 'Original', 'Score', 'movie', 'also', 'gathered', 'rave', 'reviews', 'major', 'local', 'critics', 'respectively', 'New', 'York', 'Times', 'remarkable', 'grade', '100', '%', 'leaving', 'year', 'other', 'top', 'films', 'such', 'Capote', 'behind', '90', '%', 'film', 'personal', 'story', 'two', 'brave', 'young', 'men', 'Ennis', 'Del', 'Mar', 'ranch', 'hand', 'played', 'brilliantly', 'Heath', 'Ledger', 'Jake', 'Gyllenhaal', 'stellar', 'performance', 'Jack', 'Twist', 'rodeo', 'Texan', 'cowboy', 'Ennis', 'Del', 'Mar', 'character', 'who', 'tortured', 'sensitive', 'taciturn', 'who', 'clenched', 'fist', 'expression', 'look', 'anybody', 'straight', 'eye', 'Jack', 'Twist', 'other', 'hand', 'more', 'open', 'gregarious', 'character', 'willing', 'build', 'long', 'lasting', 'relationship', 'Ennis', 'Del', 'Mar', 'repeatedly', 'due', 'rough', 'time', 'period', 'tale', 'place', 'two', 'men', 'unexpectedly', 'fall', 'love', 'summer', '1963', 'sheepherding', 'grasslands', 'mountainous', 'terrain', 'Wyoming', 'are', 'clearly', 'depicted', 'film', 'mesmerizing', 'pastoral', 'cinematography', 'When', 'summer', 'man', 'faced', 'painful', 'decision', 'taking', 'separate', 'path', 'men', 'getting', 'married', 'having', 'children', 'raising', 'own', 'families', 'However', 'still', 'manage', 'keep', 'touch', 'mail', 'visit', 'frequently', 'one', 'visits', 'Alma', 'Del', 'Mar', 'played', 'stunningly', 'Michelle', 'Williams', 'woman', 'who', 'Ennis', 'Del', 'Mar', 'marries', 'two', 'daughters', 'startling', 'revelation', 'seeing', 'husband', 'compromising', 'position', 'Jack', 'Twist', 'household', 'knowing', 'husband', 'can', 'not', 'love', 'return', 'Anne', 'Hathaway', 'equally', 'portrayal', 'Lureen', 'Newsome', 'wife', 'Jack', 'Twist', 'who', 'only', 'son', 'role', 'more', 'mature', 'far', 'more', 'different', 'role', 'previously', 'known', '2001', 'Blockbuster', 'hit', 'made', 'famous', 'Princess', 'Diaries', 'two', 'men', 'keep', 'secretive', 'relationship', 'ongoing', 'twenty', 'year', 'period', 'actors', 'do', 'very', 'well', 'aging', 'characters', 'use', 'makeup', 'growing', 'facial', 'hair', 'deepening', 'voices', 'strengthening', 'accents', 'movie', 'cliff', 'hanger', 'ending', 'soaring', 'musical', 'score', 'bound', 'haunt', 'puzzle', 'viewers', 'long', 'time', 'come', 'bone-chilling', 'effect', 'commences', 'immediately', 'film', 'screening', 'leaving', 'viewers', 'awe', 'goosebumps', 'Overall', 'Heath', 'Ledger', 'one', 'best', 'performances', 'history', 'modern', 'cinema', 'Ennis', 'Del', 'Mar', 'characterized', 'acting', 'miracle', 'critics', 'have', 'rightfully', 'rated', 'equal', 'greatest', 'performances', 'actors', 'Marlon', 'Brando', 'Sean', 'Penn', 'respectively', 'Brokeback', 'Mountain', 'epic', 'movie', 'really', 'heartstrings', 'filled', 'drama', 'adventure', 'passion', 'sorrow', 'mystery', 'suspense', 'concealment', 'resentment', 'heartbreak', 'hardship', 'betrayal', 'presence', 'several', 'elements', 'humor', 'wit', 'acting', 'performances', 'cast', 'members', 'are', 'superb', 'done', 'maximum', 'soul', 'part', 'Honestly', 'was', 'initially', 'hesitant', 'see', 'movie', 'when', 'was', 'originally', 'released', 'due', 'controversial', 'subject', 'matter', 'however', ""'m"", 'really', 'glad', 'did', 'Contrary', 'being', 'labeled', 'parodied', 'gay', 'cowboy', 'movie', 'couple', 'scenes', 'characters', 'sexual', 'orientation', 'ambiguous', 'differ', 'other', 'individuals', 'aspect', 'are', 'still', 'part', 'human', 'race', 'struggling', 'make', 'decent', 'living', '1963', 'Wyoming', 'movie', 'up', 'theme', 'love', 'nothing', 'force', 'nature', 'was', 'blown', 'away', 'found', 'be', 'one', 'most', 'powerful', 'touching', 'melancholic', 'movies', 'have', 'ever', 'seen', 'life', 'movie', 'must', 'see', 'individual', 'open', 'mind', 'who', 'not', 'offended', 'scenes', 'depict', 'violence', 'strong', 'language', 'brief', 'nudity', 'generally', 'individual', 'willing', 'see', 'overall', 'well', 'crafted', 'movie', 'give', 'two', 'thumbs', 'up']",N/A
172708,A1129LM24YWSZV,1417030321,"Nicole Bradshaw ""Nicole Bradshaw""","[87, 93]","Brokeback Mountain is the tale of two cowboys, Ennis and Jack, who ranch sheep together one summer in the 1960's. One cold night, the two men huddle together in a tent to keep warm, and an explosive physical relationship erupts. They both agree that the night was a ""one-shot deal,"" but somehow the two men keep finding one another again, throughout the summer. After the ranching gig ends, both men nonchalantly tell each other goodbye, but the separation is painful for both. Cut to four years later - the men have gone their separate ways, married, had kids. But when they happen to see each other again, old feelings almost violently assert themselves, leading to a 20-year relationship that is by turns passionate, furtive, and tortured.First of all, performances by Heath Ledger (Ennis) and Jake Gyllenhaal (Jack) are unbelievable. I cannot adequately describe the performance work in this film. Ledger, who I'd only seen in fairly superficial roles - teen movies, not-so-great romantic comedies - totally transforms himself for this role. Tight-lipped, sun-baked, and shamed, his Ennis provides the tension in the film that powers the plot through to its final, saddening conclusion. Gyllenhaal plays Jack, the more honest, self-accepting of the two men, with an emotion that is strong enough to be real but restrained enough to epitomize the tough guy image of a Western. Both lend a haunting quality to the various ways in which Ennis and Jack try to live their lives, denied of the one thing they truly want.At the end of the day, Brokeback Mountain is a love story, the tale of two people who love each other but can't be together. This is not untrod territory in Hollywood. However, hanging this familiar storyline on a less-than-mainstream social topic for the movies - homosexuality - proves to be very powerful. The intensity of the two men's feelings for one another, and the delayed gratification that is the bedrock of their relationship, bring their experience into sharp focus for the viewer. Beautiful scenes of mountainous countryside and a strong, simple acoustic guitar accompaniment add to the poignancy. I just cannot recommend it highly enough. It will haunt you. It will make you think. It will move you.Fair warning - there is one brief sex scene between the two primary characters. If you don't warm to that idea, I recommend getting the film on DVD and fast-forwarding through that part.

I was so excited that it was expanding to my area, and I went to see it the first day of release. I had heard so much hype about the film that I was almost anticipating disappointment. I was wrong. Brokeback Mountain is a delicate film, full of life and splendor. The cast and writers handled the subject matter with elegance and passion, and the simpler aspects of the film, cinematography, etc. were just as well handled.I was so pleased with the cast of Brokeback Mountain. Heath Ledger and Jake Gyllenhaall made the perfect couple - sexy, dangerous, and forbidden.  Their chemistry was beyond description, and their love scenes were realistic and sensual. (The tent scene is unbelievable, I blushed through the entire thing). I could constantly feel their pain and longing - especially Gyllenhaal's character Jack - amazing. Furthermore, the women were just as fascinating. Anne and Michelle were able to achieve in a few short minutes what some actors fail to do in hours of dull film They were thoughtful and powerful; their reactions to their husbands' behaviors were unbelievable. I was crushed by Michelle, who is receiving most of the praise, and Anne, who is unjustly being overlooked. Her phone conversation with Ennis is one of the most moving scenes in the entire film.Ang, Heath, Jake, Michelle, and Anne's greatest achievement is their delicacy. They turned what could have been a ""gay cowboy"" film into a work of art. I think Ebert said it best. He came to the conclusion that the film is so affective because it does not focus on the ""gay"" issue but rather on the story and characters. Ennis, Jack, Alma, and Lureen are so real that the reason for their existence is a non-issue.  The is a story about love, passion, and pain, not about homosexuality and adultery. Brokeback Mountain does not preach or judge for or against the characters' actions, rather it seeks to tell a story - a rarity in Hollywood - and it does so flawlessly.",5,Beautiful Gem,1138406400,"01 28, 2006",2006,2017,"['What', 'can', 'be', 'said', 'Ang', 'Lee', 'Brokeback', 'Mountain', 'beautiful', 'was', 'so', 'excited', 'was', 'expanding', 'area', 'went', 'see', 'first', 'day', 'release', 'had', 'heard', 'so', 'much', 'hype', 'film', 'was', 'almost', 'anticipating', 'disappointment', 'was', 'wrong', 'Brokeback', 'Mountain', 'delicate', 'film', 'full', 'life', 'splendor', 'cast', 'writers', 'handled', 'subject', 'matter', 'elegance', 'passion', 'simpler', 'aspects', 'film', 'cinematography', 'etc', 'were', 'just', 'as', 'well', 'handled.I', 'was', 'so', 'pleased', 'cast', 'Brokeback', 'Mountain', 'Heath', 'Ledger', 'Jake', 'Gyllenhaall', 'made', 'perfect', 'couple', 'sexy', 'dangerous', 'forbidden', 'chemistry', 'was', 'description', 'love', 'scenes', 'were', 'realistic', 'sensual', 'tent', 'scene', 'unbelievable', 'blushed', 'entire', 'thing', 'could', 'constantly', 'feel', 'pain', 'longing', 'especially', 'Gyllenhaal', 'character', 'Jack', 'amazing', 'Furthermore', 'women', 'were', 'just', 'fascinating', 'Anne', 'Michelle', 'were', 'able', 'achieve', 'few', 'short', 'minutes', 'what', 'actors', 'fail', 'do', 'hours', 'dull', 'film', 'were', 'thoughtful', 'powerful', 'reactions', 'husbands', 'behaviors', 'were', 'unbelievable', 'was', 'crushed', 'Michelle', 'who', 'receiving', 'most', 'praise', 'Anne', 'who', 'unjustly', 'being', 'overlooked', 'phone', 'conversation', 'Ennis', 'one', 'most', 'moving', 'scenes', 'entire', 'film.Ang', 'Heath', 'Jake', 'Michelle', 'Anne', 'greatest', 'achievement', 'delicacy', 'turned', 'what', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'gay', 'cowboy', 'film', 'work', 'art', 'think', 'Ebert', 'said', 'best', 'came', 'conclusion', 'film', 'so', 'affective', 'not', 'focus', 'gay', 'issue', 'rather', 'story', 'characters', 'Ennis', 'Jack', 'Alma', 'Lureen', 'are', 'so', 'real', 'reason', 'existence', 'non-issue', 'story', 'love', 'passion', 'pain', 'not', 'homosexuality', 'adultery', 'Brokeback', 'Mountain', 'not', 'preach', 'judge', 'characters', 'actions', 'rather', 'tell', 'story', 'rarity', 'Hollywood', 'so', 'flawlessly']",N/A

Where the intention of the writers, along with the vision of the director and dedication of the actors marry into a wonderful and honest piece of work.This is a story of 2 men who struggle with their identities as they find love in the least expected of places. They try to fulfill the roles they were supposed to fill in society, but when love is denied it creates tragedy for all. The story is encompassing and quite remarkable in it's depth. The film is quite breathtaking to watch with it's open ranges and wide scope,balanced with claustrophobic alleys and tight rooms. The acting is stellar, and awe inspiring. You see the characters pains struggles and doubts in their mannerisms and tears.I thought i would write this film off when i first heard about it as simple a novelty act. I am pleased to see i was absolutely wrong.

I can only state someone secure in their own beliefs and sexuality should not be threatened by a 2 hour film. Nor should they feel the need to share their insecurity and immaturity with people who are just looking for suggestions on a good film.

172714,A11B6LNU5MS6V,1417030321,N. Sturm,"[6, 6]","Brokeback Mountain has become a punchline in our culture, and I think that's a shame because it's really a pretty good movie.  Near as I can tell, there are three camps of people who don't like it: those who will never accept a movie about homosexuality, those who think it's just too slow and long, and those who think its plot and characterization actually do a disservice to LGBT individuals.  I have a few things to say to that last group:Brokeback Mountain is a tragic story about lovers who can't be together... so they're (ambiguously) gay this time, it's not really different than having them be from different races or social classes as is typical.  Point is, most viewers knew this story wasn't going to turn out well just because of the genre.  It's not punishing the main characters for having a homosexual relationship.  I know it's about time we had some movies in which the gay characters got a happy ending--however, those movies will doubtless not be set in the American south in the 1960s.Another common complaint I see is that Ennis especially was not a sympathetic character, and that most viewers felt sorry for both men's neglected wives.  My response to that is, don't you think you were supposed to?  The women didn't do anything wrong.  They got a raw deal too.  But this is a movie about unhappy people, and furthermore, *imperfect* people.  For crying out loud, do people expect every movie protagonist to be somebody they could be best friends with?  I don't like Ennis, really; he's aggressive and cold to both Alma and Jack.  That doesn't mean the story doesn't work, and that doesn't mean all gay(ish) people are implied to be unlikeable.Lastly, lots of people feel the homosexual scenes look awkward and observe the heterosexual relationships get more screentime.  They've got a point about that second part, but I think the apparent difficulty that the actors have seeming intimate suits their characterization, even if it wasn't intentional.  Jack is more comfortable with his orientation or whatever than Ennis, but neither of them really understands their own feelings or wants to be different from the norm.

I still prefer King Kong for Best Picture of 2005 but this is a close running second for me! I was amazed by both of these lead actors. They were both phenomenal in this movie. They made you feel every feeling that they were each feeling. Plus, I was able to relate to this because this kind of thing does happen. And I speak from experience (minus the whole cowboy theme).Living your life not being true to your heart is such a tragedy and that is the biggest message I left this movie with. I didn't expect it to end like it did but with that, Heath Ledger was amazing! He was absolutely brilliant in this film. The whole cast of this movie did a wonderful job and I hope that Heath does bring home the Oscar. Would have been nice if his x-girlfriend Naomi Watts was nominated for an Oscar for her brilliant work in King Kong.

His performance in this movie will be watched and admired for years to come as a landmark in acting. Bravo!Another strength of this movie is the simplicity and strong symbolism of the way the story is told. The story-telling is so genuine, like the characters' feelings for one another, you won't realize how powerful it is at first. But by the conclusion, with its definitive, heart-wrenching portrayal of what will always be divided and what can never be, you will realize that the story has entered its souls.The cinematography was mesmerizing, those images were so beautiful, and they just keep coming back to reassure you. The music score was also remarkable, and it captured the essence & emotion of the film flawlessly.This adaptation stays true to the original short story and the two lead actors fit the roles perfectly.

172730,A2N9E02BZYBU7K,1417030321,"Plom de Nume ""Rob""","[7, 53]","Some lovely cinematography and an instantly riveting character study from Heath Ledger had us straight into ""watching a new classic"" mode. Shades of The Last Picture Show, liberal overtones of late, elegiac Pekinpah and even a hint of Butch and Sundance in both the budding buddiness, the banter and the long landscape vistas. There is also, of course, the original hook of ""men's men"" bonding extending into the erotic - cowboy physicality turning sexual in what is conveyed, with lyrical toughness, as undeniably, perfectly natural in this wild, beautiful location.From the compelling opening, the affair matures and gathers poignancy, evolving from sweet infatuation to tragic separation, as the smitten pair struggle to make ""conventional"" family lives work after they leave the lovely eponymous setting of their first meeting. The film has enough generosity to portray these doomed ""normal"" lives with dignity, too, evoking equal sympathy for the sensitively-studied heterosexual partners with whom our protagonists attempt to build some kind of ""acceptable"" reality beyond the mountain. The film's initial strengths combine to make you want these guys to get back together on a permanent basis with exactly the same romantic fervour you'd normally apply to star-crossed lovers of the Shakespearian (or even Sleepless in Seattle) variety.What a pity, then, that the story outstays its welcome by about half an hour. The sexual tension to which we've been attuned begins to weaken as Jake Gyllenhaal's acting is outpaced by Ledger's. The former appears to find the conveyance of ageing as much of a challenge as James Dean did in Giant. Gyllenhaal tends to fall back on the drop-your-head for a big-eyed look-up school of appeal, which is fine for Disney but not so effective in sustained, gritty tragedy. You find yourself longing for the beauty and poignancy of John Voight's glorious Joe Buck in Midnight Cowboy. Instead, you get the Gyllenhaal signature doe-eyes (with, of course, a cool mouth-twist to denote post-millennial irony). Our Jake has gone unchallenged for too long, now: his reputation is the sum of great parts, rather than performances - in other words, luck. I hope he finds a script and a director to really stretch him soon.As for this increasingly dreary, one-note piece, there's a precise moment when I felt my attention begin to slacken, long about the time Ledger's character is sitting in a rainy car on yet another miserable day telling his daughter he doesn't think it would be a good idea for her to move in with him. One sigh and rustle of denim too many, I think, one too many raindrops on a windscreen; a bit too much wind.It's a waste of some great work to let the early energy peter out in melancholy indulgence like this. Blame Ang Lee, as well: he clearly thinks he's earned the time to depress us at length (when, actually, we've become well-invested in the story and are starting to look for narrative outcome and, if not redemption, at least some form of closure). The final test of how let down we felt is in our response to what could have been a decent, downbeat ending - if only Ledger had been encouraged to articulate the actual last line with a little more clarity. Instead, as a nice deep focus window-landscape fade went into the credits, over a swell of the simple, moving score, what we thought we heard was something between ""Sheergar's where?"" and ""Day-Care sore."" A sense of emotional short-change led swiftly into levity and undermined a lot of the decent efforts before, a feeling of ""Well, if you can't be bothered to let us hear what could have been a poignant anti-climax, we can't be bothered to take your whole point seriously."" The stronger aspects of the film deserve a much better, more disciplined last reel or so.Having deciphered the last line from Internet research, the next test would be whether we could watch it through again, so as to avoid the unfortunate bathos of Ledger's Last Gargle. Well, we can't; we'd rather watch Crash a third time. Ultimately, then, Brokeback Mountain's promise is allowed to sag, and we have to conclude that there are better male love stories. Maturin and Aubrey in Master and Comander, for one example. The Odd Couple for another. And far better, more complete films. Like Crash.Brokeback Mountain is certainly worth a viewing; but I suggest you look up the last line before setting aside the gloomy hours required to get to it. And rent, don't buy.And now (a week or so later), I'll append a counter to a counter to me, if I may:-Although this facility is best used to air considered individual opinions, it's also reasonable for us to offer temperate comments (and, where appropriate, counter-comments) on each other's views. What ""Reviewer"" (above) likes to call ""contravesry"" (sic) is the essence of healthy exchange. Just because you disagree with my critique of a film you like, however, is no basis for childish slurs on my integrity and accusations of lack of intelligence. Hating people because their tastes are different is the kind of thinking that leads to prejudices such as racism and homophobia.Reviewer judges my contribution incorrect, prejudged, and shallow. Well, I'm standing by what I liked: ""lovely cinematography"" and a ""riveting character study from Heath Ledger""; I'm sticking with my comparisons to The Last Picture Show and late, elegiac Pekinpah. I repeat that I found the (homo)sexuality ""conveyed, with lyrical toughness, as undeniably, perfectly natural in this wild, beautiful location,"" and admired the film's ""generosity"" to the cowboys' doomed heterosexual partners. I'll even repeat: ""Brokeback Mountain is certainly worth a viewing."" I trust that such features of my original review caused relatively little apoplexy in Reviewer.Having said that, I also claim the right to reiterate my unfavourable comparison with Midnight Cowboy; to say again that I found the tale ""increasingly dreary""; and that I felt a ""sense of emotional short-change"" from the director's ""melancholy indulgence."" By then, I guess Reviewer's tantrum was well under way. Indeed, my sin of ""incorrectness"" probably began with the qualification that the ""stronger aspects of the film deserve a much better, more disciplined last reel or so.""So - as for shallow? I'd say I was fair. I took the time to watch the thing; took the time to construct a review that discussed positive and negative aspects of the piece, giving credit where due; even took the time to look up Ledger's garbled valediction. And prejudged? Only in so far as I actually wanted to appreciate this movie. It's just that certain elements, such as its indulgent length, one lead's performance and occasional unintelligibility of the dialogue wouldn't allow me to love it as much as the movie and its adulators clearly thought it deserved. In fact - as I said - the flaws left me feeling cheated at a great opportunity narrowly missed through lack of discipline and a reliance on the ""issue"" itself for depth, rather than cinematic quality.Incorrect? Well, that's a matter of opinion, isn't it? It's why we have different reviewers giving different assessments. But I do think the use of ""incorrect"" is very telling, as it looks to me like the objections to my review are rather based on perceived political incorrectness than on critical inaccuracy.Reviewer is clearly a big fan of Brokeback. Indeed, ""...my family, and friends, and just about everyone I know watched this movie at least 5 times in theatre, and have all bought the DVD release."" OK, in conclusion, I'll refrain from urging Reviewer to get a life in favour of a counter counter-request for a little more balance and a mind a little more widely open to the valid, reasonably expressed views of others - rather more in keeping with the spirit of the film than his own less than charitable, pejorative outburst.",3,"When Harry Met Harry, with Stetsons but minus the

172731,AB1UMC7SB9D7Z,1417030321,"PolarisDiB ""dibness""","[12, 25]","Two cowboys in Wyoming are just looking for work when one day they happen to get the same job herding sheep about Brokeback Mountain.  For a while it's a day-in, day-out job as they slowly get tired of beans, but then, one cold night, they get a bit drunk, they get a bit confused, and the next thing you know they're in love but don't know how to deal with it.  The story follows their lives over the years as they try and manage families, keep their secrets, and yet still find time to see each other despite living in different states and having completely different lives.It's a slow, but beautiful build-up to their relationship, and then once it gets its momentum and finally starts moving, the film just gets better and better.  Compliments, of course, are towards the performers (including the supporting actors) and the direction, and a lot of this films mythic quality is on the absolutely gorgeous shooting of the Brokeback Mountain area, the only really open area shown in the film--obviously because Ennis and Jake feel rather restricted by the normal world around them.It's a good conceit, and a good theme, and tales of forbidden love and social commentary are great too.  Unfortunately, this movie isn't free from its moments of camp... like in the tent, when Jake and Ennis are looking at each other and I couldn't help thinking, ""But baby, a man's got needs!""  Or the shot of the gutted sheep, and all the time it allows around it for one to think, ""Well ain't ever'one feelin' gutted today?""  Or when Jake and his wife are out with the society couple and the woman is talking about ""Men never ask their wives to dance,"" and of course the obvious response would be something like, ""Well that's 'cause I want to dance with your man!""I'd cite more examples, but I'd neither want to spoil it or completely ruin it for you, for afterall, unintentional humor aside, the story just keeps getting more and more involving until it finally hits it's real stride, with some pretty unforgettable moments and unforgettable emotion.  Thus it is, in its own way, quite an acheivement.  Even nice little touches like the fireworks behind Ennis when he gets angry at the bikers and some rather abstract shots in the beginning keep this film engaging enough to ask us, gently, to have patience with it until it gets to where it's been meaning to go.--PolarisDiB",4,An achievement in its own way,1140998400,"02 27, 2006",2006,2362,"['Two', 'cowboys', 'Wyoming', 'are', 'just', 'looking', 'work', 'when', 'one', 'day', 'happen', 'get', 'same', 'job', 'herding', 'sheep', 'Brokeback', 'Mountain', 'while', 'day-in', 'day-out', 'job', 'slowly', 'get', 'tired', 'beans', 'then', 'one', 'cold', 'night', 'get', 'bit', 'drunk', 'get', 'bit', 'confused', 'next', 'thing', 'know', ""'re"", 'love', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'how', 'deal', 'story', 'lives', 'years', 'try', 'manage', 'families', 'keep', 'secrets', 'yet', 'still', 'find', 'time', 'see', 'other', 'living', 'different', 'states', 'having', 'completely', 'different', 'lives.It', 'slow', 'beautiful', 'build-up', 'relationship', 'then', 'momentum', 'finally', 'moving', 'film', 'just', 'better', 'better', 'Compliments', 'course', 'are', 'performers', 'including', 'supporting', 'actors', 'direction', 'lot', 'films', 'mythic', 'quality', 'absolutely', 'gorgeous', 'shooting', 'Brokeback', 'Mountain', 'area', 'only', 'really', 'open', 'area', 'shown', 'film', 'obviously', 'Ennis', 'Jake', 'feel', 'rather', 'restricted', 'normal', 'world', 'them.It', 'good', 'conceit', 'good', 'theme', 'tales', 'forbidden', 'love', 'social', 'commentary', 'are', 'great', 'too', 'Unfortunately', 'movie', ""n't"", 'free', 'moments', 'camp', 'tent', 'when', 'Jake', 'Ennis', 'are', 'looking', 'other', 'could', ""n't"", 'help', 'thinking', 'baby', 'man', 'got', 'needs', 'shot', 'gutted', 'sheep', 'time', 'one', 'think', 'Well', 'ai', ""n't"", ""ever'one"", 'feelin', 'gutted', 'today', 'when', 'Jake', 'wife', 'are', 'society', 'couple', 'woman', 'talking', 'Men', 'never', 'ask', 'wives', 'dance', 'course', 'obvious', 'response', 'would', 'be', 'something', 'Well', ""'cause"", 'want', 'dance', 'man', ""'d"", 'cite', 'more', 'examples', ""'d"", 'neither', 'want', 'spoil', 'completely', 'ruin', 'afterall', 'unintentional', 'humor', 'aside', 'story', 'just', 'getting', 'more', 'more', 'involving', 'finally', 'real', 'stride', 'pretty', 'unforgettable', 'moments', 'unforgettable', 'emotion', 'Thus', 'own', 'way', 'quite', 'acheivement', 'Even', 'nice', 'little', 'touches', 'fireworks', 'Ennis', 'when', 'angry', 'bikers', 'rather', 'abstract', 'shots', 'beginning', 'keep', 'film', 'engaging', 'enough', 'ask', 'gently', 'have', 'patience', 'where', 'been', 'meaning', 'go.', 'PolarisDiB']",N/A

I knew it was a short story book that came out in 1997 but I had never got around to reading it, so when I heard it was going to be released as a movie I was thrilled. Brokeback Mountain has garnered up many awards and nominations in the past few months. Many people have a problem with the film simply because it is what they call a ""gay love story"". This film is about 2 man having to come to terms with the love they feel so strongly for each other in a society that does not accept things that are not considered the norm. In the movie the men marry women and have kids, and try to live as normal life as they can only seeing each other a few times a year on what they refer to as fishing trips. Yet as time passes them both by they never forget how love touched them that one time and is lasting them through there lifetime. I highly recommend this movie and encourage anyone with an open mind to check it out. Brokeback Mountain is a movie about 2 people who fall in love and despite what labels people may give it thats truly what this amazing film is about. Heath Ledger and Jake Gyllenhaal give amazing performances especially Heath. I believe this film is going to sweep the Golden Globe Awards and Academy Awards not because it deals with 2 guys who love each other but because of the way it deals with the universal thing we all know and that is 2 people being in Love. Not everone can choose who they choose to love.",5,Brokeback Mountain is an awesome movie about a universal thing called LOVE,1136678400,"01 8, 2006",2006,1487,"['have', 'say', 'Brokeback', 'Mountain', 'was', 'really', 'good', 'movie', 'knew', 'was', 'short', 'story', 'book', 'came', 'out', '1997', 'had', 'never', 'got', 'reading', 'when', 'heard', 'was', 'going', 'be', 'released', 'movie', 'was', 'thrilled', 'Brokeback', 'Mountain', 'garnered', 'up', 'many', 'awards', 'nominations', 'past', 'few', 'months', 'Many', 'people', 'have', 'problem', 'film', 'simply', 'what', 'call', 'gay', 'love', 'story', 'film', '2', 'man', 'having', 'come', 'terms', 'love', 'feel', 'so', 'strongly', 'other', 'society', 'not', 'accept', 'things', 'are', 'not', 'considered', 'norm', 'movie', 'men', 'marry', 'women', 'have', 'kids', 'try', 'live', 'normal', 'life', 'can', 'only', 'seeing', 'other', 'few', 'times', 'year', 'what', 'refer', 'fishing', 'trips', 'time', 'never', 'forget', 'how', 'love', 'touched', 'one', 'time', 'lasting', 'lifetime', 'highly', 'recommend', 'movie', 'encourage', 'anyone', 'open', 'mind', 'check', 'out', 'Brokeback', 'Mountain', 'movie', '2', 'people', 'who', 'fall', 'love', 'what', 'labels', 'people', 'may', 'give', 'thats', 'truly', 'what', 'amazing', 'film', 'about', 'Heath', 'Ledger', 'Jake', 'Gyllenhaal', 'give', 'amazing', 'performances', 'especially', 'Heath', 'believe', 'film', 'going', 'sweep', 'Golden', 'Globe', 'Awards', 'Academy', 'Awards', 'not', '2', 'guys', 'who', 'love', 'other', 'way', 'universal', 'thing', 'know', '2', 'people', 'being', 'Love', 'Not', 'everone', 'can', 'choose', 'who', 'choose', 'love']",N/A

Sometimes in life an experience will come along that will change, if not define, an individual's life. Regardless it's content a deeply moving experience will forever rest inside the individuals soul, as will Ennis' love for Jack and this movie will for me.'Brokeback Mountain' is one of the finest American love stories I have encountered in some time. It's passion is intense and palpable. The character's of Ennis and Jack, as portrayed brilliantly by Heath Ledger and Jake Gyllenhaal, are caring, passionate, loyal, and tortured souls. Where Jack is more willing to accept his feelings and spend his life with the one he loves in this case Ennis, whom he falls in love with while watching after sheep on Brokeback mountain, Ennis lives with the fear and frustration of knowing such a courtship will not be accepted by the masses in Wyoming.Instead they go on with their lives, doing the proper things; get married, have kids, work hard long jobs. Their only solace coming from an annual fishing trip that allows them time alone to share their true emotions. The two men age and their lives fall apart around them, only their feelings for one another remain.I've choosen not to give too many details away about the story and the film.

But both actors are indeed great masters of the art of drama. They perform with full aplomb, their explosive rendition of raw emotions do not seem contrived or artificial. Amply supported by the female characters who are just -oh- so  natural. The director has done a superb job; to have extracted such gamut of emotions from all the actors' is a feat by itself. Of course the most impressive of all actors is Heath Ledger. He is in one word just Superb, one was so tired of the Aussie brigade with their emphasized accents (Russel Crowe), limited acting caliber ( Nicole Kidman - with forehead perpetually frozen by Botox),  sheer ugliness ( Cate Blanchet) and pretension to intellectuality (Mel Gibson ) - that Ledger seems to be a revelation of sorts. Enhanced by a superb screenplay, mind-blowing locales and explosive content it is but a MASTERPIECE. A CLASSIC OF OUR TIMES! One is indeed so lucky to have been able to see this movie!ABOUT THE AUTHOR: ANNE PROULXI will talk only about Brokeback Mountain. Annie's style is of clipped sentences, disjointed words that produce a remarkable semblance of intense empathy for her characters. The sexual content of this story is highly sensual and seem terrifyingly real as if the scenes leap out from the pages of the book. She is a highly stylized writer and commands a unique mastery over the usage of language that in a way creates a league of which she is the sole owner. Her finely etched characters seem so absolutely real that you feel a surge of pain when Jack Twist dies.She exhibits explosive finesse towards the end as the main protagonist Ennis enters a twilight zone, bereft of friends, family and most importantly his soul mate Jack Twist. Ennis is poor and living in abject poverty, pining for his love and pining so hard that you as a reader almost lament the death of Jack Twist. You're assured that it is the end of the line for Ennis. A hopeless existence, a mere pretence of a life! Now, he dreams about Jack and wakes up crying or having ejaculated in sleep. This is real melodrama; the writer gifts Ennis's hopelessness to you. You're forced to introspect your own life and come up with parallels, for instance, I still dream of not doing well in my exams and waking up thinking I have failed.This is a remarkable gift that this writer possesses for this is not a story but an almost unwanted intrusion into your own life. A chance to revise your own unfulfilled dreams, little tragedies, sorrows and the same feeling of helplessness that is now the fate of Ennis.

When I heard all of the buzz surrounding this movie, I had to see for myself what all of the fuss was about. I must admit, I was reluctant to purchase the video at first due to my own conservative attitudes. But I am glad I changed my mind. If you enjoy nothing else about Brokeback Mountain, the breath taking cinematography alone is worth the price of the video. Heath and Jake give stellar performances in this movie and they deserve every award they received even if they didn't receive the oscar. It takes true actors to pull off a role like this and these guys more than deliver. The power of Brokeback  Mountain lies not in what Ennis and Jack say and do to each other, instead it lies in what they don't say and do. The silence is so loud in this film. From the very first scene when they first meet, they never even say hello. They never really make eye contact but instead steal nonchalant glances at each other. This scene sets the tone for the entire movie. Even the most naive person can see the chemistry between the two men. Throughout the entire movie their feelings are never verbally expressed. For instance neither Jack nor Ennis ever say the words ""I love you."" Again it is in their silence that they say the most.  Some people condemn the movie as promoting homosexuality. First of all sexuality can not be promoted. If a person is gay or straight they were probably that way all along. Watching a movie would not influence them one way or the other. Others lament over these guys getting married and raising kids while maintaining their relationship. Yes, infidelity is wrong and it always will be wrong. But it has existed since the beginning of time and will continue to exist forever. If you would lay down your fundamentalist gavel and see the film with an open mind, you can no longer deny its brilliance. You don't nessesarily have to agree with the subject and contents of a movie to enjoy it. I for one can enjoy a movie for what it is. Just that, a movie and nothing more. I am proud to have this film as a part of my video collection and you will too. Anyone with half a heart and an ounce of compassion will be moved by this piece of cinema. I gotta admit however I was a bit disappointed with the ending. I thought the movie would have been even more moving if Ennis had honored Jacks final request and spread his ashes on Brokeback. But I'm not the director. Maybe mister Ang lee thought it was best to leave this way. But can you just visualize an emotionally stricken Ennis on horseback riding into the sunset with his lovers ashes being tossed into the winds on Brokeback Mountain. I felt this would have given the movie an ever more powerful emotional impact. It was also unclear to me as how Jack was killed. Did he die the way his wife says or was he severely beaten to death? Despite these minor technicalities the movie is still worth seeing. Give Brokeback Mountain a chance and I guarantee by the end of the film, after wiping away tears, the only word you will be able to utter is ""Beautiful"".",5,A beautiful piece of cinema,1144368000,"04 7, 2006",2006,3206,"['think', 'sad', 'lot', 'people', 'conservative', 'narrow-minded', 'views', 'are', 'going', 'miss', 'out', 'beautiful', 'piece', 'cinema', 'Brokeback', 'Mountain', 'When', 'heard', 'buzz', 'surrounding', 'movie', 'had', 'see', 'what', 'fuss', 'was', 'must', 'admit', 'was', 'reluctant', 'purchase', 'video', 'first', 'due', 'own', 'conservative', 'attitudes', 'am', 'glad', 'changed', 'mind', 'enjoy', 'nothing', 'else', 'Brokeback', 'Mountain', 'breath', 'taking', 'cinematography', 'alone', 'price', 'video', 'Heath', 'Jake', 'give', 'stellar', 'performances', 'movie', 'deserve', 'award', 'received', 'even', 'did', ""n't"", 'receive', 'oscar', 'true', 'actors', 'pull', 'off', 'role', 'guys', 'more', 'deliver', 'power', 'Brokeback', 'Mountain', 'not', 'what', 'Ennis', 'Jack', 'say', 'do', 'other', 'instead', 'what', 'do', ""n't"", 'say', 'do', 'silence', 'so', 'loud', 'film', 'very', 'first', 'scene', 'when', 'first', 'meet', 'never', 'even', 'say', 'hello', 'never', 'really', 'make', 'eye', 'contact', 'instead', 'steal', 'nonchalant', 'glances', 'other', 'scene', 'tone', 'entire', 'movie', 'Even', 'most', 'naive', 'person', 'can', 'see', 'chemistry', 'two', 'men', 'entire', 'movie', 'feelings', 'are', 'never', 'verbally', 'expressed', 'instance', 'Jack', 'Ennis', 'ever', 'say', 'words', 'love', 'silence', 'say', 'most', 'people', 'condemn', 'movie', 'promoting', 'homosexuality', 'First', 'sexuality', 'can', 'not', 'be', 'promoted', 'person', 'gay', 'straight', 'were', 'probably', 'way', 'Watching', 'movie', 'would', 'not', 'influence', 'one', 'way', 'other', 'Others', 'lament', 'guys', 'getting', 'married', 'raising', 'kids', 'maintaining', 'relationship', 'Yes', 'infidelity', 'wrong', 'always', 'will', 'be', 'wrong', 'existed', 'beginning', 'time', 'will', 'continue', 'exist', 'forever', 'would', 'lay', 'down', 'fundamentalist', 'gavel', 'see', 'film', 'open', 'mind', 'can', 'no', 'longer', 'deny', 'brilliance', 'do', ""n't"", 'nessesarily', 'have', 'agree', 'subject', 'contents', 'movie', 'enjoy', 'one', 'can', 'enjoy', 'movie', 'what', 'Just', 'movie', 'nothing', 'more', 'am', 'proud', 'have', 'film', 'part', 'video', 'collection', 'will', 'too', 'Anyone', 'heart', 'ounce', 'compassion', 'will', 'be', 'moved', 'piece', 'cinema', 'got', 'ta', 'admit', 'however', 'was', 'bit', 'disappointed', 'ending', 'thought', 'movie', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'even', 'more', 'moving', 'Ennis', 'had', 'honored', 'Jacks', 'final', 'request', 'spread', 'ashes', 'Brokeback', ""'m"", 'not', 'director', 'Maybe', 'mister', 'Ang', 'lee', 'thought', 'was', 'best', 'leave', 'way', 'can', 'just', 'visualize', 'emotionally', 'stricken', 'Ennis', 'horseback', 'riding', 'sunset', 'lovers', 'ashes', 'being', 'tossed', 'winds', 'Brokeback', 'Mountain', 'felt', 'would', 'have', 'given', 'movie', 'ever', 'more', 'powerful', 'emotional', 'impact', 'was', 'also', 'unclear', 'how', 'Jack', 'was', 'killed', 'Did', 'die', 'way', 'wife', 'was', 'severely', 'beaten', 'death', 'minor', 'technicalities', 'movie', 'still', 'worth', 'seeing', 'Give', 'Brokeback', 'Mountain', 'chance', 'guarantee', 'end', 'film', 'wiping', 'away', 'tears', 'only', 'word', 'will', 'be', 'able', 'utter', 'Beautiful']",N/A

It is a story that every person on earth can relate to - and will feel a kinship with.The story is so real, you will relate to it immediately, no matter who you are.  We have all known these characters, and as a result, we know that what we are seeing is real.  What we are seeing is actually every day life - things in OUR OWN world - which is why the tragedy of the story has such a tremendous impact upon everyone who sees it.  The fact that Jack & Ennis are cowboys is inconsequential; this story takes place with different characters across the globe, in Wyoming, in Kenya, in Nepal, in Poland, in Uruguay...I recommend that you see this film at LEAST twice.  Even if you do not blink throughout the movie, you will miss things if you only see it once.  Ang Lee has packed so many details into every frame that it is impossible to pick up on everyone in one viewing.Books and doctoral dissertations will be written about this film.  There is THAT MUCH brilliance put into it.  The comparisons to Homer's Aeneid and to Plato's Banquet, the yin and yang of Ennis driving across the mountainous expanse in one direction at the beginning of the film and then riding in the other direction at the end, the meaning of the color blue in the film, the astonishing camera-work in the final scene between Jack and Ennis, the stunning scene in which Ennis discovers the shirts in Jack's bedroom, and so much more will be written about and studied for decades to come.""Brokeback"" is a must-see also for at least 7 of the most brilliant acting performances ever put on film.  Heath Ledger's career and life will be transformed forever by the unforgettable brilliance of his portrayal of Ennis.  Even author Annie Proulx has indicated that Ledger understoof Ennis better than she did, and she created the character!  Jake Gyllenhaal and Michelle Williams also moved into the Big Leagues of Acting with their brilliant performances, which will delight and haunt you. Anne Hathaway is superb as the beautiful gal who becomes more blonde and stilted with every year of her loveless marriage.

172744,A23I6PFD9X6Y5D,1417030321,Raymond K. Wong,"[27, 29]","As I type these words, Brokeback Mountain just won four Golden Globe awards including Best Drama. It's no surprise to a lot of people, even though the film itself was every bit a surprise.Ennis Del Mar (Ledger) and Jack Twist (Gyllenhaal), both 19 years old, are two poor ranch hands from Riverton, Wyoming. They meet one summer while seeking jobs, and Joe Aguirre (Quaid) hires them to herd sheep up in Brokeback Mountain.Ennis is a taciturn, reserved and shy man. Jack is a charmer, a dreamer, a risk-taker. Their difficult childhoods and shared interests quickly secure a bond between them. Then one cold night, their budding friendship turns into something else: a drunken, violent sexual encounter. The next day, neither of them speaks of the incident, until Ennis tells Jack, ""What happened was a one shot deal. I ain't queer."" Jack replies, ""Me neither.""When the summer is over, Ennis and Jack go their separate ways. Ennis marries his sweetheart Elma (Williams) and they raise two daughters. Jack marries wealthy girl Lureen (Hathaway) and has a son. Everything is normal until, after four long years, Ennis receives a postcard from Jack. Something deep inside stirs up a hornet's nest. Their reunion becomes the beginning of a 20-year secret affair. Brokeback Mountain becomes their refuge from the world to which they don't belong.Ledger (Casanova) is extraordinary with his portrayal of Ennis Del Mar, a man who has few words in his vocabulary, a man so repressed that he doesn't know how to express himself or go for what he wants. Ledger reveals so much about his characters, often without saying a word. His mannerism and facial expression speak volume. He's transformed himself realistically into a man that is so unlike the actor himself, who has mostly been known for his fluffy, light performances in the past. In contrast, Gyllenhaal (Proof) has the more lively role. His Jack Twist is the opposite of Ennis in almost every way. Jack's longing for the man he loves is evident in Gyllenhaal's stellar performance. The men also share immense chemistry together. You believe they're real. You believe their feelings for each other are real.While one can argue that it's a character study of two men and their relationship, the women in the story add an immense appeal to the film. Williams (The Station Agent) is amazing with her heartbreaking performance as Ennis's long-suffering wife Alma. When she witnesses something about her husband that she doesn't fully understand, her reaction is incredibly real and painful to watch. Hathaway (Havoc) has a relatively minor role as Jack's indifferent wife Lureen. But her final scene is mesmerizing - Hathaway has matured into a fine actress.Brokeback Mountain unfolds slowly and, under the direction of Lee (Hulk), the pacing is deliberate and leisurely. At more than two hours, the film feels slow sometimes, but it is far from being boring. While the plot is simplistic, the acting is exceptional and there is so much going on at the thematic and emotional levels that one can't help but feel spellbound by the story.The script by awarding-winning writers McMurtry (Terms of Endearment) and Ossana (Dead Man's Walk) expands Proulx's short story into a languid character study that holds on to your heart and doesn't let go. The dialogue is real and to the point - nothing too poetic or out of character. Mostly episodic, there are many fine moments in the film that are emotionally raw and powerful. The ending will haunt you.Lee's direction is masterful, and it clearly demonstrates his versatility as a director. It's even more impressive when you consider Lee's heritage as a Chinese immigrant, and how he so deftly captures Americana in Brokeback Mountains. The cinematography by Rodgrigo Prieto (21 Grams) is breathtaking. The editing is crisp. Gustavo Santaolalla's (Motorcycle Diaries) score is subdue but poignant.Some say this is a ""gay cowboy"" movie. I say this is a story about love and betrayal and life.

Indeed, the landscape speaks to the viewer that this is God's country, which is untouched and uncontaminated.  The film differentiates between natural landscape and one that is defined outside of human nature.  The characters of Jack Twist (Jake Gyllenhaal) and Ennis Del Mar (Heath Ledger) blend with the natural landscape where there are little or no boundaries except the boundaries they create between themselves.  However, once they leave the backcountry, they have to live with society's boundaries.Brokeback Mountain is worthy of any high accolades because it follows in the similar footsteps as other legendary Hollywood films that possess epic qualities.  John Huston could have made this film, and John Steinbeck could have written the narrative.  But Ang Lee directed, Larry McMurtry, Diana Ossana wrote the screenplay adaption from E. Annie Proulux's narrative. It appears that most of the controversies in society tend to be overlooked in the heartland where the film takes place, Wyoming and Texas, but Hollywood tends to use the heartland as a backdrop to macro impose a difficult issue in order to see the big picture.  In this case, sexual orientation is depicted with its historical complexities that existed from the 1960s to the 1980s.The film's photography and soundtrack is effective throughout the film.  Rodrigo Prieto should be commended for the exceptional pictureresque mountainous scenes that took place at Brokeback Mountain, and Gustavo Santaolalla's score for the film.  The soundtrack is one to be considered for future listening.  The main themes as well as the piece ""Snow"" shows the tranquility of each scene in which it is played (the opening chords and melody plays similar to The Beatles' ""Blackbird"").Disregard controversy and preconceived perceptions.  The main premise of Brokeback Mountain involves requited love and the relationship between two people that spans twenty years.

If you've read or seen it, most of the US are more like Ennis's father, showing him the consequences of even unobtrusive homosexuality.

It took me a few days to contemplate the remarkable film, and I can only say the it's the biggest feather in Ang Lee's hat. Mr. Lee's sensitivity never ceases to amaze me, from the hysterically funny ""The Wedding Banquet"" (another gay-themed film), or ""Sense & Sensibility"" (Jane Austen as imagined by an Asian? Who would've thought...?), ""The Ice Storm"" (dysfunctional families abound, with great sensitivity), and, of course, ""Couching Tiger..."" Ang Lee's mastering of such diverse subjects, with amazing skill, must certainy rank him at the very top of our living directors. ""Brokeback Mountain"" is rife with style & focus. The beauty of the scenery is in direct contrast with the initial conflict. The gentlemen go off to their mundane destinies, which can, in no way, match the beauty of the environment of the mountain. I can't get certain images out of my head. Heath Ledger is absolutely amazing; I challenge anyone, male or female, straight or gay, not to shed a tear when, at the end, he finds the shirt in Jack's closet and holds it close. I'm glad that Mr. Ledger had this opportunity to legitimize the acting prowess that was so well presented in ""The Patriot"". All of the acting is, without exception, letter perfect. I still think that Jake Gyllenhaal had the toughest role, and his affection for Ennis was never in doubt. I especially liked the scene where he stood up to his big-shot father-in-law. His range of emotion was far more vast than what was expected from Ennis' character. The beautifully written script hit all the right nerves. This is NOT a gay movie; it's a film that presents an element of life, anyone's life, that under the right circumstances, could affect each and every one of us.

I haven't seen a mountain that beautiful since Julie Andrews sang to the hills in Austria...Folks, I loved the movie, but I am sick to death of hearing people assure the homophobic public that this ""really isn't a gay love story.""  The hell it ain't.  That's exactly what it is.  The movie portrays that love to be as genuine, as special, and as fulfilling as the love between straight people; a portrayal long overdue.  We also read from many, that it portrays love that cuts across gender lines.  OK.  But let's not shy away from identifying the love being portrayed.  It is a love story between two gay men (even if they can't identify themselves as gay).  It is not a gay-cowboy movie..  they herded sheep for one summer of the 20 years spanning the film.  Just two men who loved each other more than their wives,,, more than anyone else..At the end of the film I felt depressed.

I can only tell you how the movie affected me.I grew up watching Gene Autry, Roy Rogers, Hopalong Cassidy, and all the other classic western stars, so the idea of watching a film about two cowboys in love with each other just did not seem to be a road I wanted to travel. It didn't feel right; especially as I was born into a time when same sex relationships were really looked down on. Or not acknowledged. But the script was by Larry McMurtry and Diana Ossana, Ang Lee was the director, Heath Ledger has become a very interesting actor, and the rest of the cast was fine. So I picked up a copy of the film.No matter how you try to adapt and rethink your position as you age in a changing world those old devil hang-ups and prejudices sneak up on you. It took me three days to watch the first half of the film. Other than some nice scenery and a surprisingly good score it was very difficult to watch the growing bond between these two men. The first half only lays the groundwork for the second half of the movie and that is where you will see why all the acclaim and awards. I couldn't stop watching.After a long introduction of the characters the second half begins to show them as people with a problem - and it was a problem for who they were and in that time - and how they dealt with it. The first half is necessary, but it is the second half that shines. If you have an ounce of soul you will feel the pain and the love as it builds to a final fifteen minutes that is as good as filmmaking gets.

Anyone in the media who has said those words could not have ever experienced true love.  For this film was nothing but pure beauty and a kind of love that no one could ever come between.I was brought up in the 60's and i'm sure each of us on some level in that era has a ""Broke Back Mountain"" story that we've experienced.  I seem to have related more to Jake.  I had worked in the theatre world pretty much all my life where things were more open in gay life.  I also lived on a farm in Connecticut and the boy i was in love with, a few years younger than i, was more like Heath.  It was a termendious flash back of bailing hay, boy wrestling in the barn, hot sweaty sex and extreme love.  We ended up parting ways because of careers and i thought about him last night and prayed that he is doing ok.I now have a partner of many many years and i'm in my middle 50's.  Are love and bond is extremely tight.  We can't live together anymore because we both have sickly parents that we attend to but we do have a home that we go to on weekends providing no disasters with our parents.  If there was any way we could have gotten closer than we all ready are, this film did it.  It was like being with him for the very first time last night after watching this film.  What closeness and the feeling of being ""one"" that we experienced.  Again, Love.What i'm trying to put accross is, it doesn't matter if your straight or gay.  This film speaks to all of us that believe in true and everylasting love.  My hat off to the great director and to the two wonderful actors of Heath and Jake for the most convincing roll of two men so in love that you could feel each others happyness and pain.

Ledger comes of age in this movie; brooding and slouched, angling a convincing mid-western drawl from one corner of his mouth with the repressed passion of a pit bull.

Jack (played Jake Gyllenhaal) and Ennis (played by Heath Ledger) seemed more like really good buddies, who just happened to have sex with each other because there were no women around. They horsed around (no pun intended), drank, fought, and shot the s***. Even when they did appear to share their emotions, neither one ever uttered the word ""love."" The closest the audience comes to seeing that they are truly in love is when Ennis becomes jealous of Jack's gay dalliances in Mexico. Only love or hate can inspire such a strong emotion as jealousy, and from their years of being sex buddies we know that they didn't hate each other.All in all, Brokeback Mountain was a solid, good movie. Heath Ledger was perfect as Ennis-the tight-lipped and emotionally congested cowboy. The only time he ever let his guard down or succumbed to the niceties of people was when he was with Jack. (He allowed Jack to tenderly caress him, and found rest by snuggling in his arms.) The only emotion he ever let himself show in public was violence. I got the sense that when he got into fights with other men he was really trying to beat up himself. For that performance, Heath Ledger deserved all the accolades he received and may have even been jerked by the Academy for an Oscar. (Michelle Williams and Jake Gyllenhaal also turned in Oscar-worthy performances.)Jake Gyllenhaal used his lanky frame and doe-eyes to his best advantage as the bull rider with the fantastical dreams of domestic bliss with Ennis. From the first time Jack reached out to Ennis, you knew that it was over for him. Jack turned him out, but it was Ennis who held the power in the relationship by being the emotional recluse-forcing Jack to always reach out for him. Jack was as starved for emotional reciprocation as Ennis' long-suffering wife, Alma. Jack and Alma were constantly waiting for Ennis to say the there magic words that they, themselves, were afraid to say in case they didn't get the answer they wanted. His presence, as Alma learned the hard way, was not a guarantee of his love.Again, I ask, where was the love? It was deep down somewhere in Ennis, where even Ennis was unable to touch and that was the biggest flaw of Brokeback Mountain.

172758,ACAV6HZSJGUR1,1417030321,R. MacTaggart,"[4, 44]","I heard about Brokeback for six months.  From all the hype, I anticipated a sweeping love story between two cowboys.  I anticipated scenes of highly charged but tastefully photographed lovemaking between two men.That's not what I finally saw.  I watched an unsatisfying tale of tormented love between two men who meet for twenty years and usually bicker like an old, married, straight couple.  The controversial sex scenes?  But one, and it is a fully-clothed scene more akin to rape than an expression of love.  It was as painful to watch as it would be to experience.In short, Brokeback continues a theme long advanced by Hollywood: Queers cannot be happy; queers cannot have good sex.  Have we not advanced an iota since the infamous Boys in the Band, which opened in 1970?The endlessly discussed Great Gay Love Story was actually the least interesting aspect of Brokeback.  Far more interesting is what should have been the central theme: Two men who don't fit into society.  You know, cowboys.  Repeat: cowboys.  Ennis and Jack are far more at home in the sweeping, breathtaking expanse of wild America than they are in their respective cramped city apartment and suburban home.  This tension is the best part of the movie.Also interesting is the complicated relationships between the men and their wives and families.  Ang Lee would have you believe that the impediment to Jack and Ennis finding happiness as married men was their sexual orientation.  Sorry, the impediment was largely their inability to connect with mainstream expectations.  The men were only happy on Brokeback and suffocated in other roles - cowboys first; queers second.Much has been made of Heath Ledger's performance and he should have won the Academy Award.  He was wholly believable as an inarticulate cowboy.  A dazzling performance.Here's my version of Brokeback; it's about 95% the same.  What is different is that Ennis and Jack never have sex or express any kind of love even though they meet for twenty years on Brokeback.  Instead of bickering, each man finds peace in the wild - a break from the endless demands, frustrations, and disempowerment they experience in their city lives.Then Ennis discovers that his friend has died in...a car crash.  He doesn't know how to react.  He calls the widow who explains that Jack's family won't allow Jack's ashes to be scattered on Brokeback.  Ennis dutifully goes to the parents and the scene plays out almost - but not precisely - as Lee filmed it.  Jack's homophobic father offers exactly the same creepy speech but Ennis shifts uncomfortably.  He's confused and thinks: What is the old man insinuating?  Meanwhile, Jack's mother looks knowingly at Ennis - just as Lee filmed.  She then offers the perplexed man the opportunity of visiting Jack's bedroom.  Ennis goes upstairs and finds his old shirt encased in Jack's shirt; the camera has a close-up of his face as he slowly realizes: Jack loved me.  A few moments pass as Ennis's face contorts with the belated knowledge that he was in love with Jack as well.  He breaks down in heaving sobs.  As he departs the Twist home the scene plays out exactly as Lee filmed.  (Roberta Maxwell as Jack's mother also offers a dazzling performance.  Has ever so much been conveyed with so little?)When we later watch Ennis in his trailer (and after the lovely scene with his daughter), the story again plays out as Lee filmed except for the last scene.  Ennis opens the closet and reveals the Two Shirts.  As the camera stays on his back, we hear a door open.  A hand appears and massages Ennis's neck.  Then a stubble-covered face proffers a gentle kiss on the bare neck.  We then hear: ""It's OK to miss `em still, Ennis.""The two men look at each other.  Their eyes are radiant with love.  They kiss.Fade to black.Happy at last.",3,A Different Brokeback?,1144627200,"04 10, 2006",2006,3804,"['heard', 'Brokeback', 'six', 'months', 'hype', 'anticipated', 'sweeping', 'love', 'story', 'two', 'cowboys', 'anticipated', 'scenes', 'highly', 'charged', 'tastefully', 'photographed', 'lovemaking', 'two', 'men.That', 'not', 'what', 'finally', 'saw', 'watched', 'unsatisfying', 'tale', 'tormented', 'love', 'two', 'men', 'who', 'meet', 'twenty', 'years', 'usually', 'bicker', 'old', 'married', 'straight', 'couple', 'controversial', 'sex', 'scenes', 'one', 'fully-clothed', 'scene', 'more', 'akin', 'rape', 'expression', 'love', 'was', 'as', 'painful', 'watch', 'would', 'be', 'experience.In', 'short', 'Brokeback', 'theme', 'long', 'advanced', 'Hollywood', 'Queers', 'can', 'not', 'be', 'happy', 'queers', 'can', 'not', 'have', 'good', 'sex', 'Have', 'not', 'advanced', 'iota', 'infamous', 'Boys', 'Band', 'opened', '1970', 'endlessly', 'discussed', 'Great', 'Gay', 'Love', 'Story', 'was', 'actually', 'least', 'interesting', 'aspect', 'Brokeback', 'Far', 'more', 'interesting', 'what', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'central', 'theme', 'Two', 'men', 'who', 'do', ""n't"", 'fit', 'society', 'know', 'cowboys', 'Repeat', 'cowboys', 'Ennis', 'Jack', 'are', 'far', 'more', 'home', 'sweeping', 'breathtaking', 'expanse', 'wild', 'America', 'are', 'respective', 'cramped', 'city', 'apartment', 'suburban', 'home', 'tension', 'best', 'part', 'movie.Also', 'interesting', 'complicated', 'relationships', 'men', 'wives', 'families', 'Ang', 'Lee', 'would', 'have', 'believe', 'impediment', 'Jack', 'Ennis', 'finding', 'happiness', 'married', 'men', 'was', 'sexual', 'orientation', 'Sorry', 'impediment', 'was', 'largely', 'inability', 'connect', 'mainstream', 'expectations', 'men', 'were', 'only', 'happy', 'Brokeback', 'suffocated', 'other', 'roles', 'cowboys', 'first', 'queers', 'second.Much', 'been', 'made', 'Heath', 'Ledger', 'performance', 'should', 'have', 'won', 'Academy', 'Award', 'was', 'wholly', 'believable', 'inarticulate', 'cowboy', 'dazzling', 'performance.Here', 'version', 'Brokeback', '95', '%', 'same', 'What', 'different', 'Ennis', 'Jack', 'never', 'have', 'sex', 'express', 'kind', 'love', 'even', 'meet', 'twenty', 'years', 'Brokeback', 'Instead', 'bickering', 'man', 'peace', 'wild', 'break', 'endless', 'demands', 'frustrations', 'disempowerment', 'experience', 'city', 'lives.Then', 'Ennis', 'friend', 'died', 'car', 'crash', ""n't"", 'know', 'how', 'react', 'widow', 'who', 'Jack', 'family', 'wo', ""n't"", 'allow', 'Jack', 'ashes', 'be', 'scattered', 'Brokeback', 'Ennis', 'dutifully', 'parents', 'scene', 'out', 'almost', 'not', 'precisely', 'Lee', 'filmed', 'Jack', 'homophobic', 'father', 'exactly', 'same', 'creepy', 'speech', 'Ennis', 'shifts', 'uncomfortably', 'confused', 'thinks', 'What', 'old', 'man', 'insinuating', 'Meanwhile', 'Jack', 'mother', 'knowingly', 'Ennis', 'just', 'Lee', 'filmed', 'then', 'perplexed', 'man', 'opportunity', 'visiting', 'Jack', 'bedroom', 'Ennis', 'upstairs', 'old', 'shirt', 'encased', 'Jack', 'shirt', 'camera', 'close-up', 'face', 'realizes', 'Jack', 'loved', 'few', 'moments', 'pass', 'Ennis', 'face', 'contorts', 'belated', 'knowledge', 'was', 'love', 'Jack', 'as', 'well', 'down', 'heaving', 'sobs', 'Twist', 'home', 'scene', 'out', 'exactly', 'Lee', 'filmed', 'Roberta', 'Maxwell', 'Jack', 'mother', 'also', 'dazzling', 'performance', 'Has', 'ever', 'so', 'much', 'been', 'conveyed', 'so', 'little', 'When', 'later', 'watch', 'Ennis', 'trailer', 'lovely', 'scene', 'daughter', 'story', 'again', 'out', 'Lee', 'filmed', 'last', 'scene', 'Ennis', 'closet', 'Two', 'Shirts', 'camera', 'back', 'hear', 'door', 'open', 'hand', 'Ennis', 'neck', 'Then', 'stubble-covered', 'face', 'proffers', 'gentle', 'kiss', 'bare', 'neck', 'then', 'hear', 'OK', 'miss', 'em', 'still', 'Ennis', 'two', 'men', 'look', 'other', 'eyes', 'are', 'radiant', 'love', 'kiss.Fade', 'black.Happy', 'last']",N/A

Unfortunately, what ruled (and ruled out) this movie for many were labels attached to its release. The key was to look beyond those labels to be able to see a good movie.`Brokeback Mountain' is a very good movie when broken down to its talents:  story, script, directing, acting, cinematography and music.  I have almost no disagreement w/any of those subsets.In short - this is a story first and foremost about love. It's not a gay love story, but one of how love can go unfulfilled - and again, not with only the male leads in this movie. The fleshed-out script that was executed flawlessly.  Lee's directing was dead-on and the Oscar was well deserved.  As mentioned in numerous other reviews - the scenery, cinematography and music really set the stage for the overall look and feel of the movie.The reason the movie gets 4 stars for me was the acting.  Sure Gyllenhaal did a good job, but he didn't do a great job.  It was Ledger who shined.  I do think he was robbed of so many acting awards for this project.Ledger's character's pain at not being true to himself or the ones he loves (and I'm not just talking about `Jack') was palpable. His suppression of emotion is exactly what you'd expect from a character like that during a time/environment like that.  There were two scenes that got to me more than anything in the movies:  Ennis sobbing in an alley after coming off the mountain - and greeting Jack when he came for his first visit.  To me it was complete raw emotion and perfectly acted.I thought Williams did an excellent job in her role. It'd be nice to think she'll be known  more for this than something like `Dawson's Creek'.  Only Hathaway, playing Jack's wife, seemed miscast.  She wasn't as fluid an actress (or maybe it was the part) as the others. Trivial but everyone aged over those 20 years - and she looked like a 20 yo w/a succession of bad wigs. She was fine - just not to the caliber of the other actors.Do I think this is worth a purchase?  Yes.  I saw it in the theatre and purchased the DVD when it came out. If labels didn't apply - it'd be an instant classic",4,Love is Love,1145577600,"04 21, 2006",2006,2180,"['good', 'story', 'acting', 'should', 'define', 'movie', 'especially', 'category', 'drama', 'Unfortunately', 'what', 'ruled', 'ruled', 'out', 'movie', 'many', 'were', 'labels', 'attached', 'release', 'key', 'was', 'look', 'labels', 'be', 'able', 'see', 'good', 'movie.', 'Brokeback', 'Mountain', 'very', 'good', 'movie', 'when', 'broken', 'down', 'talents', 'story', 'script', 'directing', 'acting', 'cinematography', 'music', 'have', 'almost', 'disagreement', 'w/any', 'subsets.In', 'short', 'story', 'first', 'foremost', 'love', 'not', 'gay', 'love', 'story', 'one', 'how', 'love', 'can', 'go', 'unfulfilled', 'again', 'not', 'only', 'male', 'movie', 'fleshed-out', 'script', 'was', 'executed', 'flawlessly', 'Lee', 'directing', 'was', 'dead-on', 'Oscar', 'was', 'well', 'deserved', 'mentioned', 'numerous', 'other', 'reviews', 'scenery', 'cinematography', 'music', 'really', 'set', 'stage', 'overall', 'look', 'feel', 'movie.The', 'reason', 'movie', '4', 'stars', 'was', 'acting', 'Sure', 'Gyllenhaal', 'did', 'good', 'job', 'did', ""n't"", 'do', 'great', 'job', 'was', 'Ledger', 'who', 'shined', 'do', 'think', 'was', 'robbed', 'so', 'many', 'acting', 'awards', 'project.Ledger', 'character', 'pain', 'not', 'being', 'true', 'ones', ""'m"", 'not', 'just', 'talking', 'Jack', 'was', 'palpable', 'suppression', 'emotion', 'exactly', 'what', ""'d"", 'expect', 'character', 'time/environment', 'were', 'two', 'scenes', 'got', 'more', 'anything', 'movies', 'Ennis', 'sobbing', 'alley', 'coming', 'off', 'mountain', 'greeting', 'Jack', 'when', 'came', 'first', 'visit', 'was', 'complete', 'raw', 'emotion', 'perfectly', 'acted.I', 'thought', 'Williams', 'did', 'excellent', 'job', 'role', ""'d"", 'be', 'nice', 'think', ""'ll"", 'be', 'known', 'more', 'something', 'Dawson', 'Creek', 'Only', 'Hathaway', 'playing', 'Jack', 'wife', 'seemed', 'miscast', 'was', ""n't"", 'fluid', 'actress', 'maybe', 'was', 'part', 'others', 'Trivial', 'everyone', 'aged', '20', 'years', 'looked', '20', 'yo', 'w/a', 'succession', 'bad', 'wigs', 'was', 'fine', 'just', 'not', 'caliber', 'other', 'actors.Do', 'think', 'purchase', 'Yes', 'saw', 'theatre', 'purchased', 'DVD', 'when', 'came', 'out', 'labels', 'did', ""n't"", 'apply', ""'d"", 'be', 'instant', 'classic']",N/A
172760,A2R1HAXRNU0QX7,1417030321,RMurray847,"[7, 16]","I am not going to belabor the plot of the movie.  It's been well-described elsewhere, and to a large extent, this is not a plot-driven movie.  It covers a lot of time, and its characters go through a lot...but to a greater extent it's a mood or tone piece...it's not about what happens, but how what happens changes the characters.First, let me touch on the good stuff.  The obvious place to heap praise is in the acting.  Heath Ledger (as Ennis)is very good...to me he got better as the film went along.  Just watch his posture.  He's not just aging, he's ""wearying.""  A load of sadness settles on him, only momentarily lifted when he's around his daughters...or the love of his life...Jake Glynenhaal (as Jack).  It's a performance that feels as lived in as the denim clothes he wears.  Michelle Williams is very sympathetic as his wife.  Randy Quaid, in a small role, is frankly quite riveting.  He's an actor with no ego about his appearance, and he plays that for excellent effect here.  Glynenhaal, to me, is the weakest link.  His Jack Twist is a slightly less full-bodied character.  He's always full of mischief and high-spirits...sometimes its hard to find anything below that.  It's there, and it comes out at times, but sometimes I felt the actor was coasting a little bit.  He's still quite good, but is not up to Ledger's performance, and not worthy of the Oscar-buzz.The cinematography is great.  The music is very good.  And the script from Larry McMurtry and Dianna Ossana is sparse and to the point.  You can tell it's McMurtry...so many stylings of dialogue hearken to LONESOME DOVE, LAST PICTURE SHOW, etc.  And the ending of the film is typical of McMurtry's refusal to give us any closure.  Don't come into the theatre expecting to know all you want to know about the characters when you leave 134 minutes later.  McMurtry refuses to write stories that way (even adaptations) and Ang Lee (the director) is clearly interested in other things too.To say this movie is about gay love, or about how hiding your true self causes anguish overly politicizes or oversimplifies it.  The characters and situations are FAR too specific and detailed to simply be generalized.  As the two characters grow in their relationships, we grow to care about them...but we also see clearly the damage they are doing to others around them...others they should care about.  Their love is dangerous, reckless and wrong...not wrong because it's immoral for two men to love each other...but wrong because it leaves a wake of dead and damaged souls.  It's no passing fancy...they have found the love of their lives with each other, and can only endulge for a few days a year.  Yet the very act of experiencing their love hurts others.  It's not just adultery...these two men are depriving their spouses of intimacy.  They leave those that care about them (such as their children) baffled and lonely.  It's a sad situation all around...and the universal truth one might draw from it is that if only these men had been able to spend their lives openly together without fear of consequence from society...so much heartache would have been spared...and who would it have harmed?  That's certainly a valid question, but to generalize the movie to such a global conclusion, in my mind, diminishes the power of the movie itself.  Put simply, just enjoy the movie on its own terms.Ironically, I believe this ""politization"" of the movie is why it has generated so much award buzz.  I think a lot of people believe by heaping critical awards on the film, they will drive home its message.  What they are doing, however, is forcing people to take sides.  If you don't like the movie...you must be against gay relationships or worse yet, you must be a homophobe.  You can't dislike the movie just because you don't like the film.  Much like disliking SCHINDLER'S LIST (although I can't imagine disliking it myself) would have branded you as anti-semetic.  The polarization actually keeps people away from the film, I believe.For me, this is a very good film...but not GREAT.  I mentioned already all the things I liked.  But in the end, the film left me unmoved.  I wasn't emotionally invested in it beyond a casual interest in seeing how things unfolded.  While I appreciate a movie with a leisurely pace...sometimes I felt the pace was just indulgent.  And the biggest flaw was the initial sexual encounter between the men.  Where did it come from?  These two men had become friendly, out on their lonely shepherding job, but suddenly (and I do mean suddenly) a lust we hadn't seen before bubbles up and is manifested in a fairly violent and fast encounter.  The next morning, it seems just as likely that these two guys would have grown further apart, not closer together.  They generated no romantic or sexual tension.  Later, this is not the case, as their need for each other is quite palpable (lots of scenes of grabbing each other by the thick, comfortable coats they wear), but I missed the early spark which might have made me invest more of my emotion into the film as well.I recommend the film for adults (particularly since it's going to grab up so many Oscars), but to my mind, better movies this year include CRASH, CAPOTE, KING KONG and even THE 40 YEAR OLD VIRGIN.",4,Very good...but not quite the Oscar-frontrunner in my mind,1137456000,"01 17, 2006",2006,5264,"['am', 'not', 'going', 'belabor', 'plot',

172761,A2EDZH51XHFA9B,1417030321,"Robert Beveridge ""xterminal""","[9, 33]","Brokeback Mountain (Ang Lee, 2005)When it comes to the hallowed halls of the overrated director, there are few names that inspire more impassioned defense from those who think he's the second coming of Jesus than Ang Lee. (In fact, off the top of my head, I can only think of two: Steven Spielberg and Stanley Kubrick.) Did anyone really like The Ice Storm? Really? Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon is considered great by Americans who've never seen a wire-fu film before, and even Lee's greatest defenders will concede that one must overlook The Hulk when putting together Lee's resume for the hall of fame induction ceremony.Then there's Larry McMurtry, the second huge mistake made by the powers that be who decided to make this film. There's a reason no original McMurtry screenplay has made it to the big screen since Falling from Grace thirteen years ago. While McMurtry's long-winded, lackadaisical style makes for arguably decent novels, it's hell on a screen. After all, think of how much had to be pared from Terms of Endearment, Lonesome Dove, or The Evening Star to whip them into shape for filming.All that said, both Lee and McMurtry have made a career-best film with Brokeback Mountain, which is a good movie-- a very good movie-- straining to become great. One thinks that had a truly great screenplay writer adapted this (say, Rafael Yglesias, or maybe David Peoples), and a director whose work actually lives up to the hype been behind the camera (say, Julian Schnabel, or maybe Marc Caro), it would have been one for the ages.As I'm sure everyone on the planet and their dead mothers are aware, Brokeback Mountain is a love story. The principals here are Ennis Del Mar (10 Things I Hate About You's teen heartthrob Heath Ledger all grown up) and Jack Twist (Bubble Boy's Jake Gyllenhaal), who meet one summer when hired to herd sheep on Brokeback Mountain in what seems to be north central Wyoming-- in other words, as far from civilization as one can get in America and still actually be in America. During the months the two are up there, they develop a relationship that haunts them the rest of their lives. The two both end up married, Ennis to childhood sweetheart Alma (Dawson's Creek's Michelle Williams), Jack to rodeo queen Lureen Newsome (The Princess Diaries' Anne Hathaway, even more all-grown-up than Ledger); the movie tracks the twenty years after Jack and Ennis' first meeting in 1963.First, the good things about the film; Lee has actually learned how to handle a scene where characters are talking about sex without having his characters come off sounding like embarrassed preteens (one of The Ice Storm's great failings). All four of the principals turn in fine acting jobs. Heath Ledger not only gets an American accent right, but a Western drawl. Gyllenhaal can make anything (with the exception of The Day After Tomorrow) worth watching; he turned the utterly stupid Bubble Boy into comic genius, and took a script for what had hope only to be a mediocre teen flick, Donnie Darko, and made it into one of the best-loved cult films of the last decade. It's no surprise that he does well. Hathaway and Williams, on the other hand, are complete surprises. The cinematography, as is to be expected, is fantastic (one of the things I will remember about this movie for the rest of my life is the scene where they're first herding a river of sheep up the side of the mountain), and the story comes together well and stays together, for the most part, throughout.Were it that simple, this would be a great film. The flaws in it, however, are not to be overlooked. The film could have used a good editor; it's not that there are any scenes that need taken out wholesale, but trimming ten seconds here and twenty there in all the places it could have been done would have easily dropped the film under two hours, and made it a far better-paced affair. (The one scene that could have been removed entire was the final scene; Ennis driving back across the same road he'd hitched a ride up in the movie's opening shot was an obvious place for someone to say roll end credits."" No one ever did.) At least one subplot vanishes into thin air just as it gets interesting (Jack's ongoing battle for dominance with his father-in-law). The makeup guys spent way too much time looking at pictures of Robert Redford before aging Heath Ledger for the second half of the movie-- but on the other hand, the aging makeup here is top-notch (certainly Oscar-worthy, ironic as makeup is one of the few categories in which the film wasn't nominated for an Oscar). The timeframe (by necessity, of course, but it still could have been done better) expands during the last half of the movie, and it gets overly choppy as it does. (It's not a question of confusion-- it's easy to keep track of where you are-- but of certain decisions on where to cut scenes and the like.) And some of the editing in the film makes me surprised it got off the ground. I'm willing to give the film's worst edit the benefit of the doubt-- the projectionist when I saw it might have screwed up changing reels, rather than a jump that bad actually being in the film-- but there were too many overly abrupt edits in the film for it to have been reel-changing every time.None of these things on its own is enough to drag a film down, probably, but added together, they speak to the ability and lack of experience (odd, in such an experienced group) of the crew who put this film together, and cannot be overlooked. Not, of course, that they haven't been by millions of fans. This movie has been lionized by the gay community in the same way the Christians lionized The Passion of the Christ last year. The difference, aside from the fact that it seemed to me that this film was supposed to come off ""a love story"" and not ""a gay love story,"" is that The Passion of the Christ was, technically, a perfect film, or as close to it as you can get. Brokeback Mountain is a good film, to be sure, but it's far from perfect. Still, it's a good film, and one worth seeing, especially for Jake Gyllenhaal fans. *** ",4,Where was the pudding?

To put it as simply as possible, Brokeback Mountain is a work of art that slowly and almost subliminally works its way into your psyche, refusing to hint at or portray its message until the very end, at which point your emotions virtually devastate you.The storyline is pretty well-known now. Jack and Ennis, two 19-year-old ranch hands, are hired in the early 1960's to tend to a flock of sheep atop the grazing grounds of Brokeback Mountain in Montana. Jack, the son of an overly strict and distant father, is quick to make friends and laugh, while Ennis, an orphan raised by his brother and sister, is shy, withdrawn, and almost gun-shy of society. During the course of the summer, Jack gradually draws Ennis out of his shell and the two unexpectedly start a sexual relationship. At the end of summer, each goes their own way and start traditional families, but cannot deny the feelings they have for each other. They then maintain a 20-year romance through camping and fishing trips several times a year.The execution of this movie is near flawless! Cinematography is so beautiful at points, it's almost too much for the eyes to comprehend. The musical score is understated and feels perfectly at home within the film. Direction is near perfect. The film never loses focus of the two actors... from the opening scene to the end, this is a movie about them. Supporting characters are never dismissed, and though the attention is not focused on them, they are nonetheless memorable without ever stealing the scenes from the actors. The only drawback to the film is the makeup. The 2nd part of the film takes place over a span of 20 years, and shows the actors gradually aging from 19 to 39. The makeup isn't quite up to the job to make these young actors appear middle-aged and weathered. In all honesty though, I'm not sure any makeup anywhere can fully pull that off.As for the actors, Jake Gyllenhall and Heath Ledger played their roles beautifully. It quickly becomes apparent that the actors chose these parts not for the money, nor for any fame (it was never meant to be released as a major film), but rather because they believed in the story and wanted to portray their characters as best they could. Jake gives life to Jack in a refreshingly wonderful manner, and Heath disappears, leaving behind the withdrawn, shell-shocked Ennis.The movie progresses at a very slow pace. It's never boring, but throughout one wonders where the film is going and what it's trying to say. That sentiment continues to grow and almost threatens to lose you as an audience member until the last 20 minutes or so. At that point, the plot takes a sudden and surprisingly-devastating turn. It's surprisingly devastating because you simply don't expect to have made such an emotional connection with the characters, but found that you have. As the film reaches it's emotional impact, it becomes achingly apparent that it has woven itself under your skin and is now a part of you... it has its claws in you and is not letting go. As it climaxes, you're left with a rush of emotion that surprises you and that few films have ever been able to garner. It's at that point where you realize the purpose of everything previously in the film. The entire film is a leadup to one simple message, one simple premise. It's that gut-wrenching realization at the end that lingers in your mind long after you've walked away from the screen.The movie is honest. It documents and portrays. It makes no statement for or against homosexuality. It is unapologetic, yet compassionate. It's an all-time classic.",5,A work of art destined to be an all-time classic,1161907200,"10 27, 2006",2006,3680,"['really', 'so', 'much', 'say', 'movie', 'condensing', 'short', 'review', 'impossible', 'put', 'as', 'simply', 'possible', 'Brokeback', 'Mountain', 'work', 'art', 'slowly', 'almost', 'subliminally', 'way', 'psyche', 'refusing', 'hint', 'portray', 'message', 'very', 'end', 'point', 'emotions', 'virtually', 'devastate', 'you.The', 'storyline', 'pretty', 'well-known', 'now', 'Jack', 'Ennis', 'two', '19-year-old', 'ranch', 'hands', 'are', 'hired', 'early', '1960', 'tend', 'flock', 'sheep', 'grazing', 'grounds', 'Brokeback', 'Mountain', 'Montana', 'Jack', 'son', 'overly', 'strict', 'distant', 'father', 'quick', 'make', 'friends', 'laugh', 'Ennis', 'orphan', 'raised', 'brother', 'sister', 'shy', 'withdrawn', 'almost', 'gun-shy', 'society', 'course', 'summer', 'Jack', 'gradually', 'Ennis', 'shell', 'two', 'unexpectedly', 'start', 'sexual', 'relationship', 'end', 'summer', 'own', 'way', 'start', 'traditional', 'families', 'can', 'not', 'deny', 'feelings', 'have', 'other', 'then', 'maintain', '20-year', 'romance', 'camping', 'fishing', 'trips', 'several', 'times', 'year.The', 'execution', 'movie', 'flawless', 'Cinematography', 'so', 'beautiful', 'points', 'almost', 'too', 'much', 'eyes', 'comprehend', 'musical', 'score', 'understated', 'feels', 'perfectly', 'home', 'film', 'Direction', 'perfect', 'film', 'never', 'focus', 'two', 'actors', 'opening', 'scene', 'end', 'movie', 'Supporting', 'characters', 'are', 'never', 'dismissed', 'attention', 'not', 'focused', 'are', 'nonetheless', 'memorable', 'ever', 'stealing', 'scenes', 'actors', 'only', 'drawback', 'film', 'makeup', '2nd', 'part', 'film', 'place', 'span', '20', 'years', 'actors', 'gradually', 'aging', '19', '39', 'makeup', ""n't"", 'quite', 'up', 'job', 'make', 'young', 'actors', 'appear', 'middle-aged', 'weathered', 'honesty', ""'m"", 'not', 'sure', 'makeup', 'anywhere', 'can', 'fully', 'pull', 'off.As', 'actors', 'Jake', 'Gyllenhall', 'Heath', 'Ledger', 'played', 'roles', 'beautifully', 'quickly', 'apparent', 'actors', 'chose', 'parts', 'not', 'money', 'fame', 'was', 'never', 'meant', 'be', 'released', 'major', 'film', 'rather', 'believed', 'story', 'wanted', 'portray', 'characters', 'best', 'could', 'Jake', 'life', 'Jack', 'refreshingly', 'wonderful', 'manner', 'Heath', 'disappears', 'leaving', 'withdrawn', 'shell-shocked', 'Ennis.The', 'movie', 'very', 'slow', 'pace', 'never', 'boring', 'one', 'wonders', 'where', 'film', 'going', 'what', 'trying', 'say', 'sentiment', 'grow', 'almost', 'threatens', 'lose', 'audience', 'member', 'last', '20', 'minutes', 'so', 'point', 'plot', 'sudden', 'surprisingly-devastating', 'turn', 'surprisingly', 'devastating', 'simply', 'do', ""n't"", 'expect', 'have', 'made', 'emotional', 'connection', 'characters', 'found', 'have', 'film', 'emotional', 'impact', 'achingly', 'apparent', 'woven', 'skin', 'now', 'part', 'claws', 'not', 'letting', 'go', ""'re"", 'left', 'rush', 'emotion', 'few', 'films', 'have', 'ever', 'been', 'able', 'garner', 'point', 'where', 'realize', 'purpose', 'everything', 'previously', 'film', 'entire', 'film', 'leadup', 'one', 'simple', 'message', 'one', 'simple', 'premise', 'gut-wrenching', 'realization', 'end', 'mind', 'long', ""'ve"", 'walked', 'away', 'screen.The', 'movie', 'honest', 'documents', 'portrays', 'statement', 'homosexuality', 'unapologetic', 'yet', 'compassionate', 'all-time', 'classic']",N/A
172763,A16QODENBJVUI1,1417030321,Robert Moore,"[17, 68]","Are people viewing this film objectively?  Or are people either blindly affirming it as a masterpiece or condemning it as example of Hollywood's moral perversity?  My own take was somewhat different.  If people get past the fact that it stars movie stars Heath Ledger and Jake Gyllenhaal and focus on the actual characters, the inescapable truth is that this is a film about some exceedingly uninteresting and intensely bland characters who share a love over twenty years that is societally forbidden.  Now, if the two central characters were actually interesting--and remember, in a film it is the characters and not the stars that are at the heart of things--this could have led to an interesting film.  But the brute fact is that this is a film about two central characters and several secondary characters who are all intensely and spectacularly uninteresting.I think this central fact is getting lost by most who see the film.  Anyone doubting me should go back over the dialogue the two leads engage in.  Apart from a couple of memorable lines that reflect back over a couple of decades of love, where does either of the leads say anything funny or compelling or even remotely interesting?  Where is there anything that would help us understand why either was remotely interested in the other?  If you watch THE LADY EVE, it is impossible NOT to believe that Henry Fonda would have been enthralled by Barbara Stanwyck in the first fifteen minutes of the film.  But where is there any indication that either of the two leads would have thought the other as anything but an utterly uninteresting individual?And that is for me the central problem in this film:  we are presented merely with the fact of a love between two men, but never any reason for why either would have been interested in each other.  Nor are we as viewers given any reason to care about these two characters.  In fact, at film's end, I found myself even remotely caring for only two, Michelle Williams's Alma, who has to live with the knowledge that her husband has a passion for another male, and Ennis's daughter Alma Jr.  Apart from those two, I didn't manage to find a single character interesting.Despite the dramatic vacuity at the heart of the movie, this is one of the most visually beautiful movies I've ever seen.  Every movie I see that has been filmed in the Canadian Rockies increases my desire to go there someday.  The landscapes in this are as beautifal as in any movie I have ever seen, and the incredibly gifted Mexican cinematographer Rodrigo Prieto could very well win the Oscar for Best Achievement in Cinematography.  But apart from that Oscar Nomination, I have trouble understanding any of the other nominations the film received.  Even factoring in that it was a bad year for movies, the Best Picture nomination is baffling, and Jake Gyllenhaal's Best Supporting Actor nomination is a joke, since he is clearly a lead and not a supporting actor.  I will say, however, that while Heath Ledger's character is uninteresting, he acts the part magnificently.  You would swear that this young Australian is indeed a dirt poor cowboy.  But apart from his nomination and the one for Rodgigo Prieto, I can't understand the acclaim this film is receiving.My firm belief is that this is one of those film that in ten or twenty years people are going to have an exceedingly difficult time the praise it received at the time.  My only theory is that people are blinded by the innovation of the film revolving around a male-male romance into thinking that that is sufficient to guarantee its quality.  That the two characters are profoundly uninteresting doesn't seem to faze many people.  But if there were a different film with a very dull male and very dule female character, would people have accorded it the same degree of praise?  I very much doubt it.The film is made with enormous competence.  The score is good, the direction is strong, and while the characters are uninteresting, all of the performances are quite strong.  I have not read Annie Proulx's short story upon which the film is based, but I can even imagine it being a good story.  But not all short stories can translate to the big screen and this one was crippled by the fundamentally uninteresting characters.  It is, however, a truly beautiful movie to look at.  In fact, I think much of the praise the film is receiving is in fact the reflected glory of the landscapes.  Had the story taken place in a swamp, no such praise would have attached to the film.",3,A film that I was very surprised to dislike,1139616000,"02 11, 2006",2006,4518,"['Are', 'people', 'viewing', 'film', 'objectively', 'are', 'people', 'blindly', 'affirming', 'masterpiece', 'condemning', 'example', 'Hollywood', 'moral', 'perversity', 'own', 'take', 'was', 'somewhat', 'different', 'people', 'get', 'fact', 'movie', 'stars', 'Heath', 'Ledger', 'Jake', 'Gyllenhaal', 'focus', 'actual', 'characters', 'inescapable', 'truth', 'film', 'exceedingly', 'uninteresting', 'intensely', 'bland', 'characters', 'who', 'share', 'love', 'twenty', 'years', 'societally', 'forbidden', 'Now', 'two', 'central', 'characters', 'were', 'actually', 'interesting', 'remember', 'film', 'characters', 'not', 'stars', 'are', 'heart', 'things', 'could', 'have', 'led', 'interesting', 'film', 'brute', 'fact', 'film', 'two', 'central', 'characters', 'several', 'secondary', 'characters', 'who', 'are', 'intensely', 'spectacularly', 'uninteresting.I', 'think', 'central', 'fact', 'getting', 'lost', 'most', 'who', 'see', 'film', 'Anyone', 'doubting', 'should', 'go', 'back', 'dialogue', 'two', 'leads', 'engage', 'Apart', 'couple', 'memorable', 'lines', 'reflect', 'back', 'couple', 'decades', 'love', 'where', 'leads', 'say', 'anything', 'funny', 'compelling', 'even', 'remotely', 'interesting', 'Where', 'there', 'anything', 'would', 'help', 'understand', 'why', 'was', 'remotely', 'interested', 'other', 'watch', 'LADY', 'EVE', 'impossible', 'NOT', 'believe', 'Henry', 'Fonda', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'enthralled', 'Barbara', 'Stanwyck', 'first', 'fifteen', 'minutes', 'film', 'where', 'there', 'indication', 'two', 'leads', 'would', 'have', 'thought', 'other', 'anything', 'utterly', 'uninteresting', 'individual', 'central', 'problem', 'film', 'are', 'presented', 'merely', 'fact', 'love', 'two', 'men', 'never', 'reason', 'why', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'interested', 'other', 'are', 'viewers', 'given', 'reason', 'care', 'two', 'characters', 'fact', 'film', 'end', 'found', 'even', 'remotely', 'caring', 'only', 'two', 'Michelle', 'Williams', 'Alma', 'who', 'live', 'knowledge', 'husband', 'passion', 'male', 'Ennis', 'daughter', 'Alma', 'Jr.', 'Apart', 'two', 'did', ""n't"", 'manage', 'find', 'single', 'character', 'interesting.Despite', 'dramatic', 'vacuity', 'heart', 'movie', 'one', 'most', 'visually', 'beautiful', 'movies', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'seen', 'movie', 'see', 'been', 'filmed', 'Canadian', 'Rockies', 'desire', 'go', 'there', 'someday', 'landscapes', 'are', 'as', 'beautifal', 'movie', 'have', 'ever', 'seen', 'incredibly', 'gifted', 'Mexican', 'cinematographer', 'Rodrigo', 'Prieto', 'could', 'very', 'well', 'win', 'Oscar', 'Best', 'Achievement', 'Cinematography', 'apart', 'Oscar', 'Nomination', 'have', 'trouble', 'understanding', 'other', 'nominations', 'film', 'received', 'Even', 'factoring', 'was', 'bad', 'year', 'movies', 'Best', 'Picture', 'nomination', 'baffling', 'Jake', 'Gyllenhaal', 'Best', 'Supporting', 'Actor', 'nomination', 'joke', 'clearly', 'lead', 'not', 'supporting', 'actor', 'will', 'say', 'however', 'Heath', 'Ledger', 'character', 'uninteresting', 'part', 'magnificently', 'would', 'swear', 'young', 'Australian', 'indeed', 'dirt', 'poor', 'cowboy', 'apart', 'nomination', 'one', 'Rodgigo', 'Prieto', 'ca', ""n't"", 'understand', 'acclaim', 'film', 'receiving.My', 'firm', 'belief', 'one', 'film', 'ten', 'twenty', 'years', 'people', 'are', 'going', 'have', 'exceedingly', 'difficult', 'time', 'praise', 'received', 'time', 'only', 'theory', 'people', 'are', 'blinded', 'innovation', 'film', 'revolving', 'male-male', 'romance', 'thinking', 'sufficient', 'guarantee', 'quality', 'two', 'characters', 'are', 'profoundly', 'uninteresting', ""n't"", 'seem', 'faze', 'many', 'people', 'were', 'different', 'film', 'very', 'dull', 'male', 'very', 'dule', 'female', 'character', 'would', 'people', 'have', 'accorded', 'same', 'degree', 'praise', 'very', 'much', 'doubt', 'it.The', 'film', 'made', 'enormous', 'competence', 'score', 'good', 'direction', 'strong', 'characters', 'are', 'uninteresting', 'performances', 'are', 'quite', 'strong', 'have', 'not', 'read', 'Annie', 'Proulx', 'short', 'story', 'film', 'based', 'can', 'even', 'imagine', 'being', 'good', 'story', 'not', 'short', 'stories', 'can', 'translate', 'big', 'screen', 'one', 'was', 'crippled', 'fundamentally', 'uninteresting', 'characters', 'however', 'truly', 'beautiful', 'movie', 'look', 'fact', 'think', 'much', 'praise', 'film', 'receiving', 'fact', 'reflected', 'glory', 'landscapes', 'Had', 'story', 'taken', 'place', 'swamp', 'such', 'praise', 'would', 'have', 'attached', 'film']",N/A
172764,A1OBPHRXHZF8P6,1417030321,"Robin Orlowski ""political activist""","[20, 24]","1963 Wyoming range provides a quaint and ultimately charming setting for the spirited romance between Ennis Del Mar (Heath Ledger) and Jack Twist (Jake Gyllenhaal). These two cowboys fall in love with each other on a sheep herding job.The plot of the film though, is their carrying on the relationship in secret. The two men must do this because of whom they are and the times in which they live in. Specifically, they are after the magic of their first summer together--something readily transcending labels, categories, and generations.Director Ang Lee did a tremendous job with the movie, based upon E. Annie Proulx's short story. Credit also goes to Dianna Ossana and Larry McMurty for a great screenplay. I've unfortunately seen enough movies to know that great adaptations are the exception rather than the rule. In addition to it being set in the early 1960's there actually is the feel. It wasn't just a case of somebody claiming their film was set in the 1960's with obviously current props.I am really impressed with the people who were involved with this film. In spite of the meterosexualization of society, heterosexual American men are still squeamish about being involved with anything related to gay sex. This heterosexual woman joins Madonna in commending Ledger and Gyllenhaal both for their decision to read for the film. I honestly do find it shocking that these hang-ups remain in 2005.Some films you have to guess why they have received awards and award nominations. However, Brokeback Mountain is one of the titles where audiences will instantly know why it won or was nominated for (among the countless honors) National Board of Review Top 10 Films, Director of the Year, Los Angeles Film Critics Association Best Picture, Outstanding Actor in a Motion Picture, and Golden Globe Awards for Best Motion Picture-Drama, Best Director, Best Actor Motion Picture Drama, and Best Supporting Actress.",5,Yippie-yaah!,1134950400,"12 19, 2005",2005,1917,"['1963', 'Wyoming', 'range', 'quaint', 'ultimately', 'charming', 'setting', 'spirited', 'romance', 'Ennis', 'Del', 'Mar', 'Heath', 'Ledger', 'Jack', 'Twist', 'Jake', 'Gyllenhaal', 'two', 'cowboys', 'fall', 'love', 'other', 'sheep', 'herding', 'job.The', 'plot', 'film', 'carrying', 'relationship', 'secret', 'two', 'men', 'must', 'do', 'whom', 'are', 'times', 'live', 'Specifically', 'are', 'magic', 'first', 'summer', 'together', 'something', 'readily', 'transcending', 'labels', 'categories', 'generations.Director', 'Ang', 'Lee', 'did', 'tremendous', 'job', 'movie', 'based', 'E.', 'Annie', 'Proulx', 'short', 'story', 'Credit', 'also', 'Dianna', 'Ossana', 'Larry', 'McMurty', 'great', 'screenplay', ""'ve"", 'unfortunately', 'seen', 'enough', 'movies', 'know', 'great', 'adaptations', 'are', 'exception', 'rather', 'rule', 'addition', 'being', 'set', 'early', '1960', 'actually', 'feel', 'was', ""n't"", 'just', 'case', 'somebody', 'claiming', 'film', 'was', 'set', '1960', 'obviously', 'current', 'props.I', 'am', 'really', 'impressed', 'people', 'who', 'were', 'involved', 'film', 'spite', 'meterosexualization', 'society', 'heterosexual', 'American', 'men', 'are', 'still', 'squeamish', 'being', 'involved', 'anything', 'related', 'gay', 'sex', 'heterosexual', 'woman', 'Madonna', 'commending', 'Ledger', 'Gyllenhaal', 'decision', 'read', 'film', 'honestly', 'do', 'find', 'shocking', 'hang-ups', 'remain', '2005.Some', 'films', 'have', 'guess', 'why', 'have', 'received', 'awards', 'award', 'nominations', 'However', 'Brokeback', 'Mountain', 'one', 'titles', 'where', 'audiences', 'will', 'instantly', 'know', 'why', 'won', 'was', 'nominated', 'countless', 'honors', 'National', 'Board', 'Review', 'Top', '10', 'Films', 'Director', 'Year', 'Los', 'Angeles', 'Film', 'Critics', 'Association', 'Best', 'Picture', 'Outstanding', 'Actor', 'Motion', 'Picture', 'Golden', 'Globe', 'Awards', 'Best', 'Motion', 'Picture-Drama', 'Best', 'Director', 'Best', 'Actor', 'Motion', 'Picture', 'Drama', 'Best', 'Supporting', 'Actress']",N/A
172765,A19ZXK9HHVRV1X,1417030321,Roland E. Zwick,"[12, 16]","Is it possible for a film - any film - to truly make the world a better place?  I have no way of confidently answering that question, but if any movie COULD do such a thing, then ""Brokeback Mountain"" would be that film.  Here's that rare work that has the power to transform not only how the individual sees the world but how society sees itself.  By putting something never before seen on the screen, director Ang Lee and writer Larry McMurtry earn their place in movie history - and the undying respect of film lovers everywhere.By now, most people know that ""Brokeback Mountain"" tells the story of Ennis and Jack, two young cowboys who, in the summer of 1963, sign up to herd sheep in Wyoming and wind up falling in love.  Jack is the outgoing one of the two, seemingly more in touch with his homosexuality than is Ennis, who is introverted and taciturn almost to the point of somnambulism.  Something powerful takes hold of them up there on Brokeback Mountain, and while they both end up going their separate ways - Jack to become a rodeo rider and get married, Ennis to settle down on a ranch with his wife and two little daughters - the attraction they feel for one another never lessens.  In fact, it becomes only more intense over the years, as the men come to realize that each has found in the other his true soul mate, his ideal partner for life - if only circumstances and society weren't conspiring to keep them apart.  Instead, all they have to hold on to over the next twenty years are a few fleeting but passionate encounters in the one place where they are free to be who they truly are.Tales of unrequited love have, of course, been a staple of literature since storytelling began, but by making this a GAY love story, the filmmakers bring a renewed power to the genre.  Forced to look at it from a novel perspective, we feel as if we are seeing romantic love being played out for the first time.  There are those who have accused the film of trying to ""glorify"" adulterers, as if this were the first time in which a story of unrequited love involved cheating spouses.  Would these same people object to ""Anna Karenina,"" ""Doctor Zhivago"" or ""Brief Encounter"" on such spurious grounds?  If anything, ""Brokeback Mountain"" points out the absurdity of a society that tells gay people they shouldn't even BE gay but should  live their lives as heterosexuals.  If Ennis' and Jack's wives are victims, they are far more the victims of a society that forces gays into loveless marriages than of Ennis and Jack, who are simply conforming to what society itself claims it wants them to be.By making the two central characters rugged macho cowboys, the author of the original short story, E. Annie Proulx, not only shatters a gay stereotype, but brilliantly finds the hitherto elusive portal into the consciousness of a mainstream audience.  Certainly, this story would not have worked commercially had it been about two gay hairdressers living in San Francisco.  For the first time in a Hollywood film, we have major gay characters who are not AIDS victims, psycho killers or limp-wristed best friends of the main female character.  Moreover, the movie subtly plays with the latent homoerotic undercurrents that have always been a part of western folklore but which have heretofore been hidden safely enough under the surface so that only those looking for them could find them.  Yet, for all its sociological significance, this is, first and foremost, a story about love - deep, raw, all-consuming love - and it is that which makes the movie connect with all audiences, regardless of sexual orientation.As Ennis, Heath Ledger's performance is nothing short of a revelation, a triumph of minimalist acting.  With his tightly pursed lips, barely whispered monotone and slumped shoulders, Ledger brilliantly conveys the soul of a man struggling with the truth about himself and straining with every fiber in his body and being to avoid acknowledging that truth.  So tormented is he in his life that Ennis seems to be trying to pull back his words even as he's uttering them.  A masterpiece of understatement, Ledger's work here quite simply ranks with the great screen performances of all time.  As Jack, Jake Gyllenhall provides the perfect balance for Ledger, a free spirit more willing to take a chance and defy society, if only he could get his partner to go along with him.  Michelle Williams hits amazing dramatic heights as Alma, Ennis' bewildered wife, who suffers in silence after she learns the heartbreaking truth about her husband.  Anne Hathaway is effective in her few scenes as the girl who ends up roping the rodeo star Jack, unaware of who it is she has really caught.Ang Lee's direction is intense, lyrical and visually ravishing, zeroing in on the human drama with laser-like precision and making the stark Wyoming landscape an integral part of that drama.  Lee makes it so that it is the SILENCES that really matter here, those moments between words when love and feelings are most completely communicated.Just to show that even a great film need not be perfect, there are times when the movie - a tad too long at two hours and 15 minutes - sags a bit by wandering off into one too many subplots.  But the emotions in the film are so raw and engulfing that the film at its best makes us realize just how insignificant and piddling most movies really are.  This is one movie that actually stays with you long after you've left the theater.When the history of the movies comes to be written, ""Brokeback Mountain"" will take its place among the handful of films that can truly be termed ""watersheds"" or ""landmarks,"" movies that helped to redefine what cinema could be and do.  And it will be one of the few, in the long run, that really mattered.",5,a landmark in movie history,1136764800,"01 9, 2006",2006,5768,"['possible', 'film', 'film', 'truly', 'make', 'world', 'better',

You feel at the same time at one with nature, and isolated and insignificant in its grandeur.So I found visual thrills in this movie, but unfortunately not the thrill of any real love story. Yes, there can be tacit love. And yes, cowboys are notoriously taciturn. But there's a limit. Ultimately, human love has to be built on some words, on some shared history, on some weaving of one's individual biography into a shared narrative. And there is none of that here.Heath Ledger is so choked back and nonverbal in his roll as Ennis that I at first had to turn on the English subtitles to my DVD to catch what few words he is mumbling. There doesn't seem to be any point beyond the sexual in being with someone like him. He has no enlarging view to offer, no wit, no sustaining support. And the Jack Twist character isn't much better.But the men's failure as lovers goes beyond their inarticulateness. If you truly love someone, you carry a lamp glowing inside you. You see reflections of that person in everyone you meet and so you confer that spark to all your encounters in life. You bring that spark to everything you do. It sustains and animates you. It makes you want to perfect. And there was none of that here.To the contrary, the two men make the lives of their everyday spouses and girlfriends a misery by their inexplicable unavailability, their withdrawal and lack of essential interest. They are always elsewhere. They are always frozen in disaffection for the ones with whom they might really have forged some bond, albeit not a bond based on any sexual urgency.Lust aches. Love lightens. So this relationship never much gets beyond lust. Instead of carrying their forbidden love as a secret charm that could radiate, the two men in this movie schlep through their days spreading a sort of emotional blight wherever they go. Instead of being a tragedy about how prejudice prevented two people from being together, the overriding tragedy of this movie is how often people can't get beyond specific sexual craving in order to joyfully abide in the life that is proffered to them.Finally, were the namings of these two characters (Ennis and Twist) a little too suggestive? I didn't read the Annie Proulx short story on which this movie is based. So I don't know if her original characters had these names. If they did, it seems to undermine any serious, heartfelt intent for the story. By the unlikely coincidence of these men having Stud Magazine names, it in fact seems to reduce and doom their relationship from the outset to - just sex.",3,No Love Lost,1145145600,"04 16, 2006",2006,2682,"['scenery', 'movie', 'breathtaking', 'framing', 'photography', 'sweep', 'vastness', 'twilight', 'prairie', 'mountain', 'feel', 'same', 'time', 'one', 'nature', 'isolated', 'insignificant', 'grandeur.So', 'found', 'visual', 'thrills', 'movie', 'unfortunately', 'not', 'thrill', 'real', 'love', 'story', 'Yes', 'can', 'be', 'tacit', 'love', 'yes', 'cowboys', 'are', 'notoriously', 'taciturn', 'limit', 'Ultimately', 'human', 'love', 'be', 'built', 'words', 'shared', 'history', 'weaving', 'one', 'individual', 'biography', 'shared', 'narrative', 'none', 'here.Heath', 'Ledger', 'so', 'choked', 'back', 'nonverbal', 'roll', 'Ennis', 'first', 'had', 'turn', 'English', 'subtitles', 'DVD', 'catch', 'what', 'few', 'words', 'mumbling', ""n't"", 'seem', 'be', 'point', 'sexual', 'being', 'someone', 'enlarging', 'view', 'offer', 'wit', 'sustaining', 'support', 'Jack', 'Twist', 'character', ""n't"", 'much', 'better.But', 'men', 'failure', 'lovers', 'inarticulateness', 'truly', 'love', 'someone', 'carry', 'lamp', 'glowing', 'see', 'reflections', 'person', 'everyone', 'meet', 'so', 'confer', 'spark', 'encounters', 'life', 'bring', 'spark', 'everything', 'do', 'want', 'perfect', 'was', 'none', 'contrary', 'two', 'men', 'make', 'lives', 'everyday', 'spouses', 'misery', 'inexplicable', 'unavailability', 'withdrawal', 'lack', 'essential', 'interest', 'are', 'always', 'elsewhere', 'are', 'always', 'frozen', 'disaffection', 'ones', 'whom', 'might', 'really', 'have', 'forged', 'bond', 'not', 'bond', 'based', 'sexual', 'urgency.Lust', 'aches', 'Love', 'lightens', 'So', 'relationship', 'never', 'much', 'lust', 'Instead', 'carrying', 'forbidden', 'love', 'secret', 'charm', 'could', 'radiate', 'two', 'men', 'movie', 'days', 'spreading', 'sort', 'emotional', 'blight', 'wherever', 'go', 'Instead', 'being', 'tragedy', 'how', 'prejudice', 'prevented', 'two', 'people', 'being', 'together', 'overriding', 'tragedy', 'movie', 'how', 'often', 'people', 'ca', ""n't"", 'get', 'specific', 'sexual', 'craving', 'order', 'joyfully', 'abide', 'life', 'proffered', 'them.Finally', 'were', 'namings', 'two', 'characters', 'Ennis', 'Twist', 'little', 'too', 'suggestive', 'did', ""n't"", 'read', 'Annie', 'Proulx', 'short', 'story', 'movie', 'based', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'original', 'characters', 'had', 'names', 'did', 'undermine', 'serious', 'heartfelt', 'intent', 'story', 'unlikely', 'coincidence', 'men', 'having', 'Stud', 'Magazine', 'names', 'fact', 'reduce', 'doom', 'relationship', 'outset', 'just', 'sex']",N/A

172777,A32XW50ILWOXNO,1417030321,Samuel McKewon,"[36, 41]","The deepest wounds to ""Brokeback Mountain"" have been inflicted by those who trumpet as more than the humble masterpiece that it is. A breakthrough picture for gay rights...a torch for tolerance...such bouquets diminish the universal themes found in the movie's story of two men - one gay, one confused, both broken - and their 20-year love affair after a summer herding sheep in the Wyoming highlands. ""Brokeback Mountain"" drips with longing and regret that knows no sexual orientation.Director Ang Lee opens his picture in a gravel parking lot occupied by Ennis Del Mar (Heath Ledger) and Jack Twist (Jake Gyllenhaal). They're silent strangers brought together by ranch manager Joe Aguirre (Randy Quaid). Jack's estranged from his father. Ennis' dad is dead. Aside from the job, that's their first bond. They swap jobs once on the mountain. They drink whiskey, shoot coyotes, curse the beans in tomato sauce. Jack makes a move one night when they both sleep in the tent. Ennis relents. The experience and the totality of the summer ruins him.The Academy Award winning screenplay from Larry McMurtry and Diana Ossana explores how the men live on unsteadily, marry women, have children, and get together one or twice a year for a ""fishing trip."" That's a change from E. Annie Proulx's source short story, which mostly recounts Ennis and Jack's arguments and passions during their encounters. What Lee, McMurtry and Ossana transform her story into is an epic that reveals the pain Ennis spreads to his wife Alma (Michelle Williams), the daughter most like him (Kate Mara) and, after divorcing Alma, to a hopeful waitress named Cassie (Linda Cardellini). Jack has more of an agreement with his hardened Daddy's girl Lureen (Anne Hathaway) than a marriage - ""we could do it over the phone,"" he tells Ennis - and it frees him to make as many trips to Mexican bathhouses as he chooses.Jack's a dreamer, and he begs Ennis to work a ranch with him. Ennis answers with a childhood story about a couple cowboys who live together, ""tough old birds,"" who were found beaten and castrated at the bottom of a ditch. It goes on like that, Jack wanting more than Ennis will give. Jack wants the summer eternal. Ennis, broke, estranged from his own children, unable to look his ex-wife in the eye, is also wracked with love and lust, yet empty, distant.For all its anguish, ""Brokeback Mountain"" has a lovely, good-natured screenplay full of small asides and local humor, probably courtesy of McMurtry (""Lonesome Dove,"" ""The Last Picture Show""). It allows us to enjoy the men as men, the women as women, a laugh as a laugh. Lee orchestrates a particularly good scene on Thanksgiving, where a long-running feud between Jack and his father-in-law culminates in an argument over whether Jack's son can watch TV during dinner. Lee is a model of restraint in every scene but one, where a buff Jack washes his torso while Ennis sits in the foreground, cooking beans. Lee has already helmed a domestic masterpiece in ""The Ice Storm;"" he combines his ability to reveal dining-table truths with artistic helicopter shots of the mountain.Ledger is some actor. It takes range to play the burdened Ennis, Casanova and surfer hippie (""The Lords of Dogtown"") in one year. He is the picture of repression in ""Brokeback Mountain"" a character worth genuine pity who, when he finds the right words for his daughter in the movie's last scene, has accomplished a feat 20 years in the waiting. That he reserves it for her is overlooked by most critics - Proulx's story doesn't have this ending - but crucial to appreciating what Ennis has learned. Gyllenhaal is 25, yet he plays the older Jack fiercely. He's a selfish SOB, but hard not to like. Both twang and spit the distinctive cowboy chatter of the screenplay with ease. Williams and Hathaway convey enough in short onscreen bursts, and the pretty Mara, like Ledger, transmits a lot through her silences.To its end, ""Brokeback Mountain"" refuses to underline itself. It is a calm, sad, loving sigh of a thing. So while the inevitable, crude backlash is unfortunate, Lee does his own efforts no great favor to rewrite his film as an event or monument when it was made on a modest budget as modest movie about average men. And Proulx's letter to the Academy following the movie's Best Picture loss to ""Crash"" is arrogant and damaging to the potential audience it could reach. This is a work of art. Not an essay. Pop culture has done it few favors. Maybe time will.",5,An exercise in humanity and humility (in case you thought it was a statement movie),1144108800,"04 4, 2006",2006,4477,"['deepest', 'wounds', 'Brokeback', 'Mountain', 'have', 'been', 'inflicted', 'who', 'trumpet', 'more', 'humble', 'masterpiece', 'breakthrough', 'picture', 'gay', 'rights', 'torch', 'tolerance', 'such', 'bouquets', 'diminish', 'universal', 'themes', 'found', 'movie', 'story', 'two', 'men', 'one', 'gay', 'one', 'confused', 'broken', '20-year', 'love', 'affair', 'summer', 'herding', 'sheep', 'Wyoming', 'highlands', 'Brokeback', 'Mountain', 'longing', 'regret', 'sexual', 'orientation.Director', 'Ang', 'Lee', 'picture', 'gravel', 'parking', 'lot', 'occupied', 'Ennis', 'Del', 'Mar', 'Heath', 'Ledger', 'Jack', 'Twist', 'Jake', 'Gyllenhaal', ""'re"", 'silent', 'strangers', 'brought', 'together', 'ranch', 'manager', 'Joe', 'Aguirre', 'Randy', 'Quaid', 'Jack', 'estranged', 'father', 'Ennis', 'dad', 'dead', 'Aside', 'job', 'first', 'bond', 'swap', 'jobs', 'once', 'mountain', 'drink', 'whiskey', 'shoot', 'coyotes', 'curse', 'beans', 'tomato', 'sauce', 'Jack', 'move', 'one', 'night', 'when', 'sleep', 'tent', 'Ennis', 'relents', 'experience', 'totality', 'summer', 'him.The', 'Academy', 'Award', 'winning', 'screenplay', 'Larry', 'McMurtry', 'Diana', 'Ossana', 'how', 'men', 'live', 'unsteadily', 'marry', 'women', 'have', 'children', 'get', 'together', 'one', 'twice', 'year', 'fishing', 'trip', 'change', 'E.', 'Annie', 'Proulx', 'source', 'short', 'story', 'mostly', 'Ennis', 'Jack', 'arguments', 'passions', 'encounters', 'What', 'Lee', 'McMurtry', 'Ossana', 'transform', 'story', 'epic', 'pain', 'Ennis', 'wife', 'Alma', 'Michelle', 'Williams', 'daughter', 'most', 'Kate', 'Mara', 'divorcing', 'Alma', 'hopeful', 'waitress', 'named', 'Cassie', 'Linda', 'Cardellini', 'Jack', 'more', 'agreement', 'hardened', 'Daddy', 'girl', 'Lureen', 'Anne', 'Hathaway', 'marriage', 'could', 'do', 'over', 'phone', 'Ennis', 'make', 'many', 'trips', 'Mexican', 'bathhouses', 'chooses.Jack', 'dreamer', 'Ennis', 'work', 'ranch', 'Ennis', 'answers', 'childhood', 'story', 'couple', 'cowboys', 'who', 'live', 'together', 'tough', 'old', 'birds', 'who', 'were', 'found', 'beaten', 'castrated', 'bottom', 'ditch', 'Jack', 'wanting', 'more', 'Ennis', 'will', 'give', 'Jack', 'summer', 'eternal', 'Ennis', 'broke', 'estranged', 'own', 'children', 'unable', 'look', 'ex-wife', 'eye', 'also', 'wracked', 'love', 'lust', 'yet', 'empty', 'distant.For', 'anguish', 'Brokeback', 'Mountain', 'lovely', 'good-natured', 'screenplay', 'full', 'small', 'asides', 'local', 'humor', 'probably', 'courtesy', 'McMurtry', 'Lonesome', 'Dove', 'Last', 'Picture', 'Show', 'enjoy', 'men', 'men', 'women', 'women', 'laugh', 'laugh', 'Lee', 'particularly', 'good', 'scene', 'Thanksgiving', 'where', 'long-running', 'feud', 'Jack', 'father-in-law', 'culminates', 'argument', 'Jack', 'son', 'can', 'watch', 'TV', 'dinner', 'Lee', 'model', 'restraint', 'scene', 'one', 'where', 'buff', 'Jack', 'torso', 'Ennis', 'sits', 'foreground', 'cooking', 'beans', 'Lee', 'already', 'helmed', 'domestic', 'masterpiece', 'Ice', 'Storm', 'ability', 'reveal', 'dining-table', 'truths', 'artistic', 'helicopter', 'shots', 'mountain.Ledger', 'actor', 'range', 'play', 'burdened', 'Ennis', 'Casanova', 'surfer', 'hippie', 'Lords', 'Dogtown', 'one', 'year', 'picture', 'repression', 'Brokeback', 'Mountain', 'character', 'worth', 'genuine', 'pity', 'who', 'when', 'right', 'words', 'daughter', 'movie', 'last', 'scene', 'accomplished', 'feat', '20', 'years', 'waiting', 'reserves', 'overlooked', 'most', 'critics', 'Proulx', 'story', ""n't"", 'have', 'ending', 'crucial', 'appreciating', 'what', 'Ennis', 'learned', 'Gyllenhaal', '25', 'yet', 'older', 'Jack', 'fiercely', 'selfish', 'SOB', 'hard', 'not', 'like', 'twang', 'spit', 'distinctive', 'cowboy', 'chatter', 'screenplay', 'ease', 'Williams', 'Hathaway', 'convey', 'enough', 'short', 'onscreen', 'bursts', 'pretty', 'Mara', 'Ledger', 'lot', 'silences.To', 'end', 'Brokeback', 'Mountain', 'underline', 'calm', 'sad', 'loving', 'sigh', 'thing', 'So', 'inevitable', 'crude', 'backlash', 'unfortunate', 'Lee', 'own', 'efforts', 'great', 'favor', 'rewrite', 'film', 'event', 'monument', 'when', 'was', 'made', 'modest', 'budget', 'modest', 'movie', 'average', 'men', 'Proulx', 'letter', 'Academy', 'following', 'movie', 'Best', 'Picture', 'loss', 'Crash', 'arrogant', 'damaging', 'potential', 'audience', 'could', 'reach', 'work', 'art', 'Not', 'essay', 'Pop', 'culture', 'done', 'few', 'favors', 'Maybe', 'time', 'will']",N/A

The film documents their complex relationship over the next twenty years.Spoiler warning: Plot and/or ending details follow.When the two men first begin work on Brokeback Mountain, Ennis is stationed at the base camp while Jack watches after the sheep higher on the mountain. They initially meet only for meals at the base camp, where they gradually become friends. After a time they switch roles, with Jack taking over duties at base camp and Ennis tending the flock. One night, after the two share a bottle of whiskey, Ennis decides to remain at the base camp overnight instead of returning up the mountain. Ennis is at first reluctant to even sleep in the same tent as Jack, but late that night the men share a brief, intense sexual encounter. Over the remainder of the summer their sexual and emotional relationship deepens further.After the two part ways at the end of their job, Ennis marries his long-term fianc&eacute;e Alma Beers (Williams), and starts a family. Jack moves to Texas, where he meets and marries rodeo princess Lureen Newsome (Hathaway). The couple soon has a son.Four years later, Ennis receives a postcard from Jack asking if he wants to meet when Jack passes through the area. The men reunite, and their passion immediately rekindles. Jack broaches the subject of creating a life together on a small ranch. Ennis, haunted by a childhood memory of the torture and murder of a gay man in his hometown, fears that such an arrangement can only end in tragedy. He is also unwilling to leave his family. Unable to be open about their relationship, Ennis and Jack settle for infrequent meetings on camping trips in the mountains.Ledger as Ennis Del Mar.As the years pass, Ennis's marriage deteriorates. Unknown to him, the relationship was discovered by Alma who eventually divorces him and takes custody of their two daughters. Jack hopes that Ennis's divorce will allow them to live together at last, but Ennis refuses to move away from his children. Meanwhile, his oldest daughter, Alma Junior, visits Ennis on a periodic basis, and Ennis meets and dates a waitress. On another trip with Jack in the mountains, Ennis insists, to keep his job, he cannot meet with Jack again before November. Ennis and Jack's frustrations finally erupt into a bitter argument and a struggle becoming a desperate embrace. However, the two men part upset.Months later, a postcard Ennis sent to Jack, about meeting in November, is returned in the mail, stamped ""deceased"". In a strained telephone conversation, Jack's wife Lureen tells Ennis that Jack died in an accident. As she explains, a brief scene of Jack being beaten to death, by 3 men, illustrates Ennis' fears that Jack's death was not accidental. Lureen tells Ennis that Jack wished to have his ashes scattered on Brokeback Mountain. She suggests that Ennis contact Jack's parents about this.Ennis visits Jack's parents and offers to take Jack's ashes to Brokeback Mountain. Jack's father refuses, insisting that Jack's remains be buried in the family plot. Jack's mother is more welcoming, and allows Ennis to see Jack's boyhood bedroom. Ennis discovers in this room, two old shirts hidden in the back of the closet. The shirts, hung one inside the other on the same hanger, are the ones the two men were wearing on their last day on Brokeback Mountain in 1963.Shortly after Ennis meets Jack's parents, his daughter visits him at his home. Now 19 years old, she's getting ready to marry a boy, and asks for her father's consent in giving her away at the wedding. Ennis seems initially reluctant, citing that he might have to work, but decides against it and pours two glasses of whiskey for him and his daughter with which to celebrate. Ennis asks if her fiance loves her, and she affirms that he does.At the end of the movie, Ennis opens his own closet to reveal that he has hung the two shirts reversed, with his plaid shirt hugging Jack's blue shirt, inside the door beneath a postcard of Brokeback Mountain. Ennis carefully fastens the top button of Jack's shirt. With tears in his eyes, Ennis mutters, ""Jack, I swear . . . ."" [9], and then, he slowly, carefully straightens the postcard of Brokeback Mountain and closes the door. As the door closes on the closet, it opens a long view to the outside, through the window, to the green and yellow fields and the dirt road outsideHeath Ledger has putten his best in the movie.

172781,A3U6WGSBAECZAF,1417030321,"!Scipio Africanus, Vanquisher of Hannibal ""Th...","[9, 61]","It remains an insolvable enigma as to why Brokeback Mountain--this radicalized, g*y agenda-endorsing recruitment drive with no redeemable merits--has such an overwhelmingly, almost fanatically agreed-upon approval by reviewers who are either declining to use morals in evaluating the film, or are simply too nave, short-sighted, or gullible to know better!!!! Brokeback Mountain is far from a controversial movie; insinuating that it's merely controversial makes it appear as though it has points of contention which have good arguments on either side. In morally clear and stark reality, however, Brokeback has absolutely no redeemable qualities since it advocates (in no particular order) the dissolution of marriage; alternative lifestyles which threaten the traditional, nuclear family; infidelity; and pursuit of one's animalistic lust in spite of the consequences.In a nutshell, Brokeback recounts the distressing story of two bisexuals who get into each other's pants while working as sheep herders in Wyoming; they worsen this irreligious affair by continuing their illegal, clandestine lust while being married and trying to raise families later on!!!! Reprimanding Brokeback for the g*y-pushing propaganda that it is isn't deserving of accusations of ""bigotry""--as the simple-minded moral relativists who rave about Brokeback fall back on whenever their ideological movie is justifiably criticized. Besides the fact that the vast majority of Americans still rejects g*y marriage/civil unions and its destruction of traditional and therefore sustainable society, criticism against Brokeback also involves a totally non-g*y related issue: the advocacy of infidelity and the breakup of the nuclear family the film pushes.When Ennis and Jack ""see"" each other on their wilderness hikes, they're engaging in an illicit affair which callously hurts their respective wives and their innocent children!!!! If a person were to interpret Brokeback as the poster movie for the fictional concept of ""g*y rights,"" one can conclude that g*ys are for the destruction of families, the unit which ensures a stable, orderly society. G*ys themselves ought to exercise some moral clarity and be outraged that another liberal, Hollywood movie represents their demographic so unflatteringly. This movie is such a cold, typical, liberal-minded exercise in the ideology of ""if it feels good, do it,"" that it warrants the illicit lust of two g*ys to be together in total selfishness despite all the pain they're inflicting on their families and all the responsibilities they have to them.As with any predictable, liberal movie from Hollywood--which is misguidedly for the fiction that g*y ""rights"" are somehow ""constitutional"" despite that homosexuality is based only on willful behavior instead of something that's inherent in people--Brokeback abuses notions of longing and the alleged ""true love"" between Ennis and Jack to feloniously justify all the ruination their g*y relationship brings. The scheme of the devious filmmakers was clearly to cast Brokeback as a hard-to-believe, innocent ""love story."" By perpetrating this fr*ud, the filmmakers are successful in provoking reactions of sentimentality and empathy from the generally moral relativist/unobservant, movie-going public, which direly needs some conservatism so they can identify these noxious schemes by the liberals in entertainment. By selling Brokeback as a mere ""love story,"" all the more sinister implications that I've rationally outlined above can be dismissed.This is the reprehensibly unscrupulous spin the moral relativist supporters of this film misuse to justify the radicalized, g*y-agenda push. However, even half-educated persons will be able to see through this ruse, as Brokeback Mountain is nothing but a fierce advocate for g*y marriage also. The movie's plot is maneuvered in such a way that the traditional, heterosexual marriages of Ellis and Alma and Jack and Lureen, respectively, are derided as ""obstacles"" which stand in the way of the g*y ""love-fest"" of Ennis and Jack. As such, Brokeback flagrantly pushes the misconstruction that Ennis and Jack could've been together and their families spared the pain if, and ONLY if, g*y marriage was legalized in the US (which will NEVER happen, thankfully, due to conservatives and traditionalists).Brokeback was an ideological movie which quickly lost the sensationalistic ""steam"" the liberal media kept forging for it, sputtering to a mean total of merely $83 million at the end of its domestic run. This not-too-surprising phenomenon was glaringly due to the fact that mainly liberals in the coastal, blue states were the primary driving force of this irreligious movie, but traditionalists in the Heartland, the Midwest and the South wisely didn't bother with this foulness.All the misleading exaggerations about the awards Brokeback's received are discreditable because the ones giving out the rewards are the same liberal, Hollywood and entertainment-circle degenerates who endorse g*y ""rights."" Folks who misinform you that Brokeback's really about the love between two people are doing the work of g*y, special interests, as Brokeback glorifies infidelity, the ruination of marriage, and the hurting of children. Brokeback's recommended viewing so it can disclose to people just how anti-traditional and radicalized the ""values"" of the g*y marriage/""rights"" cause are!!!!",1,"This ferociously liberal, pro-g*y

Annie Proulx wrote an amazing short story about two sheep hearderd who fall in love in 1960s Wyoming, and when it is reborn by director Ang Lee (Academy Award Winner---Brokeback Mountain, 2005) who brings it to life in its full fledged glory. Heath Ledger, Enus, is one of the best actors of our time, and now he finally proves it with Brokeback. Jake Gyllenhaal, Jack, also on one of the best young talents in Hollywood deserved to win the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor, but it was George Clooney's year, and Clooney was excellent in Syriana as well.Director Ang Lee makes this superb film, capturing the beauty and mystery of the mountains in Wyoming. Enus (Ledger) is an engaged cowboy who is looking for a job when he finds one, hearding sheep in the mountains of Brokeback with another cowboy, Jack (Gyllenhaal). The two begin to lose control of themselves, and then end up falling in love within the first twenty minutes of the film. Enus is engaged to Alma, played by the wonderful Michelle Williams. She soon finds out the truth of her husband. Jack later marries Lureen, played by Havoc's Anne Hathaway who bares all in the best roll, next to her part in Havoc (a 2005 film that was released straight on DVD---check into it), of her career. She plays a cold-hearted woman.The film is released from Focus Features who had a big year this year with Brokeback Mountain, The Constant Gardener, and Pride and Prejudice. The film did not win the Best Picture Academy Award, getting beat by Crash, which was an amazing film, but it did not deserve to win.

The lead actors are outstanding, Ennis [Heath Ledger, who gives no hint of his Australisian heritage] is darkly brooding and guarded, damaged as he is by early experiences of poverty, intolerence and fear. Jack [Jake Gyllenhaal] is dramaticly more available, passionate and needs driven than his lover. Their love is a tender and tragic pot-boiler which resonates an aching sense of longing and of both hope and hopelessness. These two young actors express levels of experience and pathos way beyond achievements their ages would suggest an aptitude for, being actually 25 and 24 respectively.

Others rave about Ang Lee's beautiful portrayal of the American West, and it is certainly nice, but merely window dressing.Apparently many are dissappointed that this got turned down from Best Picture, granted instead to the equally manipulative and shallow Crash.

Obviously, that was done deliberately to depict the personalities of the men and the acting was stellar in that department.After about 45 minutes, the movie really picked up for me.

172793,A2PJUHR9LD9XKZ,1417030321,Skywalker,"[1, 1]","Many beautiful pictures, good music and a melancholy plot, but not much more... was my first impression. Until a scene quite at the beginning of the film came back to my mind where Jack tells Ennis that his parents are ""Pentecostals"" and the born and raised Methodist Ennis asks him what exactly is meant by Pentecost. Jack cannot give him a clear answer, but my impression is now that this is precisely the film's theme.Pentecost was the day when the Holy Spirit came over Jesus' disciples and Maria, so that they became one with Creation and could from then on speak to all people in any kind of language; so to say a reversal of the Babylonian curse which resulted in people no longer managing to communicate. The surprising and beautiful part in ""Brokeback Mountain"" is that during the months they spend there together Ennis and Jack indeed find a common language, one that goes beyond friendship and sex. This also explains why both their marriages fail, because for whatever reason, with their wives they can never be themselves as they do with one another, find understanding without words, share everything that matters. There are never such simple gestures of trust and tenderness between them and their women as Ennis and Jack find when they are together.Ang Lee's directing style is very quiet and subtle; ""Brokeback Mountain"" is not your typical US-American blockbuster presenting a moral on a silver plate. Before I watched the film I had read up in more than one source that the film's theme was to find an excuse for why these men ""become gay""; how they are ""left alone in nature and loneliness"" in the mountains until their natural drives overcome them because they are alone for months without a woman nearby, and that afterwards they cannot stop sinning once they started it. I guess that was a conventional do-gooder interpretation wanting to say ""poor boys, it's not their fault if they get seduced, and afterwards they are contaminated and can no longer find fulfilment in a normal marriage""... A very foolish interpretation in my eyes. I cannot believe that any man who is 100 % straight would start an affair with another man after a few weeks only on account of ""certain physical needs"" (apart from the fact that they both have to work hard and do not have much physical energy left to begin with); neither does this explain why they should share kisses and caresses.As far as I know no one until now has ever managed to solve the riddle as to why two people fall in love with one another, but a blind man can see that Jack and Ennis are in love head over heels. Ennis will need by far a longer period to accept that Jack is and always will be the most important person in his life, but when they first separate for an indefinite time he already breaks down as if someone had torn his heart from his chest.In the end ""Brokeback Mountain"" is a western, and friendship and companionship between men is a central matter in almost all western stories; this film merely has the courage to take the friendship one step further.It is a great love story, no sociocritical piece or plea for minorities. And though it is very melancholy, at the end it leaves the viewer to himself and the question how many people living on this planet (many of whom probably like to spend their time bashing gay people) not only never experience such communication and mutual language with another person, but probably also spend their lives searching for it in vain.",5,What does Pentecost mean...?

For the longest time I avoided seeing this film, because I was afraid of how I would feel about it. Not for it's subject matter, I have sat through and enjoyed many gay themed films. I feared more that this was just another over-hyped oscar winning dissapointment, Like so many other oscar winners over the past few decades. Personally I was deeply moved by this film.  There are very many lessons to be learned from Brokeback Mountain. Not necessarily about homosexuality, but about the nature of love itself. Brokeback Mountain makes you realize how powerful a force like love is. It can create such beauty and passion. Yet at the same time destroy lives with the intensity of a furious hurricane. The main thing I liked about the picture, is that it doesn't take sides. Every character in this film is a victim. Jack and Ennis are both lonely and miserable, while Alma and Lureen have to suffer through infidelity and loveless marriages. They could have easily turned this film into a mockery of itself, although people make fun of it anyway, it never made a wrong turn for me.The performances are revolutionary. I really agree with people who put Heath Ledger's performance up there with Brando. He completly embodied Ennis Del Mar, the way Charlize Theron embodied Aileen Wurnos in ""Monster. The moment where he breaks down in the alleyway after Jack left just really tears you up. Saying that, I have to say as great as Jake Gyllenhaal was in this film, I did think he was bit overshadowed by Ledger. But I really loved the way that you could guess what he was feeling just from his facial expressions. One scene that comes to mind, is the one where he is dancing with Lureen and you can see this sadness in his eyes as he turns away from her, like he is pining for something pining for Ennis.Michelle Williams is an incredible actress, I've seen her in Wendy and Lucy and Synechdoche,NY, and it amazes me that she hasn't gotten more recognition then she's already recieved, the moment when she see's Ennis from the porch she shows such a genuine reaction.This was also a huge breakout movie for Anne Hathaway, who before had only been known for playing disney princesses.Out of all the films Ang Lee has directed this is probably my favorite of his, or at least tied with The Ice Storm. It amazes me how versatile  he continues to be from doing Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon to Sense & Sensibility.

They share the stories of their love deprived  childhoods and on a cold night they end up sharing a tent.  They make love and develop a passionate bond.

Jack is able to express his dissatisfaction with being apart from his true love and repeatedly suggests that he and Ennis get a ranch together.

It is truly poignant and touching. It is also refreshing to see bisexual/gay men portrayed as masculine. In the majority of movies and TV shows homosexual men are portrayed as effeminate queens. I know that many gay men in real life are effeminate. However for every queen there is also a masculine man who happens to be homosexual. The friendship and love between Ennis and Jack is palpable in this film. The trajedy of the societal constraints which keep them apart is achingly portrayed.

172803,AGMW3I34INNYG,1417030321,Stephen Cannon,"[27, 29]","To say that Brokeback Mountain is a bold film may seem like a foregone conclusion for some.  I was surprised by how the film handles its subject - two rugged cowboys dealing with the fact that they have fallen in love with each other - considering that this may be the most boldly gay film to be released in mainstream American cinema.Heath Ledger is Ennis Del Mar, a classic movie cowboy.  Ennis is very much a man's man.  He doesn't speak much; he takes as much pleasure from working than most anything else; and he likes to unwind with a cigarette and some whiskey at the end of the day.  Jack Twist, played by Jake Gyllenhall, is a would-be rodeo cowboy, although he's not very good at it.  Jack daydreams and hopes to achieve his vision of bullriding success.  The two are paired together on a job tending sheep on a mountain (yes, Brokeback Mountain) in Wyoming in the summer of 1963.  One of them is to sleep high up near the sheep, while the other camps at the base of the mountain to guard the flock from other threats.  One night after a little too much whiskey, the two find themselves in the same tent, and awkwardly they act on their confused feelings for each other.  This scene is one of the most uncomfortable scenes in film, although this seems to be the intent.  These two don't know how to act out these feelings, and what's more, they know that society tells them that it's wrong.  Nonetheless, they continue to indulge themselves.  When the summer ends, they attempt to go back to 'normal.'  Ennis is getting married (to real life love Michelle Williams), and not long after he has two girls in close proximity to each other.  Jack meets a cute Rodeo girl (Anne Hathaway) who falls for him, and they in turn get married.  They have a son, but for Jack and Ennis, they can never replace what they had with each other.This film is difficult on many levels.  Those who are uncomfortable with homosexuality will not want to see this movie.  As a straight man who has known several gay men, I found much of this movie a little awkward at least.  The emotions feel real, though, and there is a real sensitivity to what these men might have gone through.  The acting from all four principals is very good, and Ang Lee's directing is perfect; he knows when to be subtle and when to pour it on.  Great film, but be ready to struggle with your own emotions here.

The fact that the two main characters are cowboys, a traditionally masculine image, makes this all the more powerful. Yes, you can be gay and macho at the same time.This is a long overdue, stereotype-breaking movie. While this was initially set in the early sixties, we still live in a society in which there are definite limits to 'acceptable conduct', based on gender. Even today, if two men greeted each other with a kiss in a supermarket setting, the way women often do, they would be seen as nancy boys.

It is a breakthrough film, and there is pain and misery, but the quality of the story, the script, and the acting rise above everything else and come across as true, compelling, and universal. Brokeback is not about gay love; it's not about forbidden love; it's not about star-crossed love. It's about accepting people for who they are and the joy of a true bond of love.I thought the love scenes might be a little off-putting, but they were genuinely touching. For Ennis and Jack, it wasn't just about sex; more important was the emotional freedom and trust they allowed each other, so they could open up to happiness rather than suffer in loneliness.

At summer's end, Ennis marries his fiancee Alma (Michelle Williams), while Jack goes back to the rodeo. Four years later, after his own marriage to Lureen (Anne Hathaway), and both men have children, Jack initiates a reunion. The twenty-year secret relationship between the two men has shattering consequences for their marriages and lives... Simply put, this is a love story. For those worried about seeing a gay-themed film, rest assured that there is nothing sordid nor confronting about the depiction of the physical relationship (much to the disappointment of the Religious Right who've tried to demonize this film as a Trojan horse for mainstreaming ""deviant"" porn). Rather, the whole thing is done with such subtlety and dignity that you cannot help but feel for Jack and Ennis, irrespective of your own orientation. Heath Ledger is especially good, giving a performance that's astonishing for the way it communicates so much with so little. The film is worth seeing for him alone.My only criticism is the pacing. There are long stretches of this film where very little of substance happens. Some parts are agonizingly dull. Those who've seen the film numerous times disagree, arguing that every scene, every shot, is filled with layers of symbolism and resonant meaning. So perhaps this is a film you need to see several times to appreciate fully.The film has attracted a fair amount of predictably irate and thoughtless criticism from those cribbing their remarks from ""The Celluloid Closet"" and arguing that this is ""just another one of those films"" that characterizes all homosexual relationships as necessarily tragic and impossible. Get a grip. This isn't 2006. It's the 1960s. In Texas and Wyoming. Notwithstanding that context, from the moment Jack and Ennis connect, the possibility of some kind of life together is constantly on offer as far as Jack is concerned - all Ennis has to do is say he wants it. It's his inability to choose that possible life, rather than his desire for it, that makes this story a tragic one.",4,"An original love story told with dignity, tenderness and grace",1139097600,"02 5, 2006",2006,2218,"['summer', '1963', 'ranch', 'hand', 'Ennis', 'Del', 'Mar', 'Heath', 'Ledger', 'rodeo', 'cowboy', 'Jack', 'Twist', 'Jake', 'Gyllenhaal', 'meet', 'fall', 'love', 'working', 'isolation', 'Brokeback', 'Mountain', 'summer', 'end', 'Ennis', 'fiancee', 'Alma', 'Michelle', 'Williams', 'Jack', 'back', 'rodeo', 'Four', 'years', 'later', 'own', 'marriage', 'Lureen', 'Anne', 'Hathaway', 'men', 'have', 'children', 'Jack', 'reunion', 'twenty-year', 'secret', 'relationship', 'two', 'men', 'shattering', 'consequences', 'marriages', 'lives', 'Simply', 'put', 'love', 'story', 'worried', 'seeing', 'gay-themed', 'film', 'rest', 'assured', 'nothing', 'sordid', 'confronting', 'depiction', 'physical', 'relationship', 'much', 'disappointment', 'Religious', 'Right', 'who', ""'ve"", 'tried', 'demonize', 'film', 'Trojan', 'horse', 'mainstreaming', 'deviant', 'porn', 'whole', 'thing', 'done', 'such', 'subtlety', 'dignity', 'can', 'not', 'help', 'feel', 'Jack', 'Ennis', 'irrespective', 'own', 'orientation', 'Heath', 'Ledger', 'especially', 'good', 'giving', 'performance', 'astonishing', 'way', 'so', 'much', 'so', 'little', 'film', 'worth', 'seeing', 'only', 'criticism', 'pacing', 'are', 'long', 'stretches', 'film', 'where', 'very', 'little', 'substance', 'happens', 'parts', 'are', 'agonizingly', 'dull', 'who', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'film', 'numerous', 'times', 'disagree', 'arguing', 'scene', 'shot', 'filled', 'layers', 'symbolism', 'resonant', 'meaning', 'So', 'perhaps', 'film', 'need', 'see', 'several', 'times', 'appreciate', 'fully.The', 'film', 'attracted', 'fair', 'amount', 'predictably', 'irate', 'thoughtless', 'criticism', 'cribbing', 'remarks', 'Celluloid', 'Closet', 'arguing', 'just', 'one', 'films', 'homosexual', 'relationships', 'necessarily', 'tragic', 'impossible', 'Get', 'grip', ""n't"", '2006', '1960s', 'Texas', 'Wyoming', 'Notwithstanding', 'context', 'moment', 'Jack', 'Ennis', 'connect', 'possibility', 'kind', 'life', 'together', 'constantly', 'offer', 'as', 'far', 'Jack', 'concerned', 'Ennis', 'do', 'say', 'inability', 'choose', 'possible', 'life', 'rather', 'desire', 'story', 'tragic', 'one']",N/A

I believe everybody who hasn't seen the film know the rest. The character driven story is held by a tremendous young cast of actors. Gyllenhaal puts himself up there to become a great leading man in Hollywood, Anne Hathaway has become the new Reese Witherspoon and in time assuming she stays on track will become a leading force. Michelle Williams has left James Van Der Beek crying into his Pillow back in Dawson's Creek as she has now come into her own. Finally Heath Ledger, by far one of the most powerful performances he has ever produced. A complex, engrossing portrayal, Ennis presents himself as a more conventional male stereotype than Jack, so the tension between his masculinity and his sexuality is all the more demanding.

I am what you would call an ardent film buff owning many DVD titles that I'm proud of, so I consider myself a lttle perceptive when it comes to films. When a movie can make you feel an overabundance of emotions it's doing it's job.Brokeback Mountain is about 2 men coming to terms with their sexuality in the early '60's when they meet while herding sheep on a ranch. Their time together also makes them realize their fondness for one another and thus a love affair is born. To me  the greatest love story ever told begins at this point.With beautiful scenery ( the film was shot near Calgary, Alberta, Canada), an excellent script, superb directing by Ang Lee, and wonderful performances especially by Heath Ledger who puts on the greatest performance by an actor I have ever seen, Brokeback Mountain has everything a film should have.It's been many years since a film from Hollywood has explored the sensitive subject of homosexuality. The last film that I saw that was superb in dealing with this was ""Making Love"", and what I like about ""Brokeback"" is that gay men are depicted as normal average Americain men. Also, during the 2 hours no one is going to die from AIDS, no one want's a sex change, and the gay leads are not having sex with an overabundance of guys.Thank you Ang Lee and the other's associated with the making of this film and most of all Heath Ledger; you have made Ennis Del Mar my hero.

But the truth is, ""Brokeback Mountain"" is an emotionally charged love story directed with maturity, elegance, and grace by Ang Lee.  Heath Ledger and Jake Gyllenhaal play two men (Ennis Del Mar and Jack Twist) who get a gig as shepherds at (where else?) Brokeback Mountain (based in Wyoming but filmed in Alberta).  Their working relationship morphs into a friendship, which takes an intimate turn when Ennis and Jack have a tryst on one cold night.  They swear it's a one-time thing, but in reality, they try to carry on a twenty-year affair unbeknownst to the wives they eventually marry (Michelle Williams and Anne Hathaway).  The beauty of ""Brokeback"" is that it doesn't take sides or cast judgement.  Ang Lee lets you feel each of the character's pain, frustration and anxiety.  We sympathize with Jack's longing, and we witness Ennis struggling to balance both a family and the man he so desires.  We also ache with Ennis' wife Alma (Williams), who can't even begin to grasp the words to describe what she sees when she catches her husband kissing another man from her window.  For her, it seems, homosexuality is completely outside her realm of understanding.  But ""Brokeback"" wouldn't stand tall without its performances, which are collectively outstanding.  What's also remarkable is how the screenwriters took the 40-odd-page short story (written by Annie Proux) and stretched it to a movie that runs for over two hours.  Rush-released shortly after the Oscars, this DVD somewhat skimps on the extras (no director's commentary, for instance).

172822,A3VAXB8CDYY5BG,1417030321,The Wingchair Critic,"[0, 0]","Ang Lee's 'Brokeback Mountain' (2005) is certainly a film about a passionate love relationship between two men, but it's equally about loneliness, isolation, lack of self-acceptance, fear, betrayal, the inability to communicate effectively, and the destructive results of broad but deeply ingrained social prejudices.As such, 'Brokeback Mountain' is a film of enormous universal appeal, which no doubt explains why the film is profoundly touching diverse audiences everywhere. Most people, regardless of orientation or background, have experienced some or all of these difficult elements in their own lives.Though not technically perfect, the film actually achieves much more than being a mere exercise in cinematic polish: it is genuinely moving, deeply compassionate, poignant, tender, gripping, and superbly intelligent. 'Brokeback Mountain' is about two men who fall in love with one another in the early 1960s--two people--two human beings. It tells its sometimes unpleasant story in three vibrant dimensions, and, in doing so, casts a soul and a shadow across the screen.'Brokeback Mountain' in also incredibly nuanced in every manner possible--there are more than dozen scenes, both major and minor, which can be broadly interpreted; at least one pivotal scene remains almost entirely open to audience interpretation.The film also gains from repeated viewings, as scene after scene seem to take on new dimensions and meanings.What does the slaughtered sheep Ennis discovers after his initial intimate encounter with Jack symbolize? What else might the sheep's mutilated carcass remind him of? Is Ennis, semi-consciously or unconsciously, planting an idea in Jack's mind when he says he's &#34;had no chance to sin&#34;?Why does Ennis lose control of himself while he and Jack are play-wrestling? Why does Lee choose to frame Ennis against a night sky of exploding fireworks during a Fourth of July celebration? Does Jack's mother invite Ennis up to view Jack's room with a special goal in mind? Why does she nod subtly when Ennis returns to the central room, and have a paper bag waiting for him nearby?Why does Ennis change his mind about attending a pivotal event in his daughter's life in the film's last scene?Heath Ledger gives one of the greatest and most understated performances ever presented in an American film. Note how Ledger doesn't require any dialogue to express Ennis' deeply conflicted, gravely isolated psyche: he conveys it through the manner in which Ennis walks, mumbles, hangs his head, and, in one grim scene, forks his way listlessly through a slice of apple pie in what appears to be an off-hour bus depot.The manner in which Ennis and Jack express their passion for one another is incredibly moving, since their attraction is primarily an expression of emotional desire and deep longing rather than a matter of strictly physical attraction.Jake Gyllenhaal does his best work in the film when illustrating Jack's tenderness for Ennis in three key scenes: on the occasion of their second intimate encounter, on the afternoon they leave the mountain, and during their last meeting; and tenderness expressed between men is a thing rarely seen in American cinema. Additionally, adult love has seldomly been depicted in film as convincingly as it is in 'Brokeback Mountain.'It's probable that the film's brief last line, hauntingly delivered by Ledger, will go down in film history, since it allows Ennis to finally express, as best he is able, everything he has felt for Jack over several decades in three terse, surging, terribly sad words.With the exception of children, 'Brokeback Mountain' is a film for all audiences. It's a grand thing to actually discover a mature, intelligent film that is 'adult' in the best sense of the word, which is also profound and highly enjoyable. 'Brokeback Mountain' has proven to have a kind of healing power over its many of its viewers, and thus is a film all audiences potentially gain from seeing.",5,'BrokeBack Mountain' Casts a Shadow Across the Screen,1139356800,"02 8, 2006",2006,3967,"['Ang', 'Lee', ""'Brokeback"", 'Mountain', '2005', 'certainly', 'film', 'passionate', 'love', 'relationship', 'two', 'men', 'equally', 'about', 'loneliness', 'isolation', 'lack', 'self-acceptance', 'fear', 'betrayal', 'inability', 'communicate', 'effectively', 'destructive', 'results', 'broad', 'deeply', 'ingrained', 'social', 'prejudices.As', 'such', 'Mountain', 'film', 'enormous', 'universal', 'appeal', 'doubt', 'why', 'film', 'profoundly', 'touching', 'diverse', 'audiences', 'everywhere', 'Most', 'people', 'regardless', 'orientation', 'background', 'have', 'experienced', 'difficult', 'elements', 'own', 'lives.Though', 'not', 'technically', 'perfect', 'film', 'actually', 'much', 'more', 'being', 'mere', 'exercise', 'cinematic', 'polish', 'genuinely', 'moving', 'deeply', 'compassionate', 'poignant', 'tender', 'gripping', 'superbly', 'intelligent', 'Mountain', 'two', 'men', 'who', 'fall', 'love', 'one', 'early', '1960s', 'two', 'people', 'two', 'human', 'beings', 'sometimes', 'unpleasant', 'story', 'three', 'vibrant', 'dimensions', 'doing', 'so', 'soul', 'shadow', 'screen', 'Mountain', 'also', 'incredibly', 'nuanced', 'manner', 'possible', 'are', 'more', 'dozen', 'scenes', 'major', 'minor', 'can', 'be', 'broadly', 'interpreted', 'least', 'one', 'pivotal', 'scene', 'almost', 'entirely', 'open', 'audience', 'interpretation.The', 'film', 'also', 'gains', 'repeated', 'viewings', 'scene', 'scene', 'seem', 'take', 'new', 'dimensions', 'slaughtered', 'sheep', 'Ennis', 'discovers', 'initial', 'intimate', 'encounter', 'Jack', 'symbolize', 'What', 'else', 'might', 'sheep', 'mutilated', 'carcass', 'remind', 'Is', 'Ennis', 'semi-consciously', 'unconsciously', 'planting', 'idea', 'Jack', 'mind', 'when', '34', 'had', 'chance', 'sin', '34', 'Why', 'Ennis', 'lose', 'control', 'Jack', 'are', 'play-wrestling', 'Why', 'Lee', 'choose', 'frame', 'Ennis', 'night', 'sky', 'exploding', 'fireworks', 'Fourth', 'July', 'celebration', 'Does', 'Jack', 'mother', 'invite', 'Ennis', 'up', 'view', 'Jack', 'room', 'special', 'goal', 'mind', 'Why', 'nod', 'subtly', 'when', 'Ennis', 'central', 'room', 'have', 'paper', 'bag', 'waiting', 'nearby', 'Why', 'Ennis', 'change', 'mind', 'attending', 'pivotal', 'event', 'daughter', 'life', 'film', 'last', 'scene', 'Heath', 'Ledger', 'one', 'greatest', 'most', 'understated', 'performances', 'ever', 'presented', 'American', 'film', 'Note', 'how', 'Ledger', ""n't"", 'require', 'dialogue', 'express', 'Ennis', 'deeply', 'conflicted', 'gravely', 'isolated', 'psyche', 'conveys', 'manner', 'Ennis', 'walks', 'mumbles', 'head', 'one', 'grim', 'scene', 'way', 'listlessly', 'slice', 'apple', 'pie', 'what', 'be', 'off-hour', 'bus', 'depot.The', 'manner', 'Ennis', 'Jack', 'express', 'passion', 'one', 'incredibly', 'moving', 'attraction', 'primarily', 'expression', 'emotional', 'desire', 'deep', 'longing', 'rather', 'matter', 'strictly', 'physical', 'attraction.Jake', 'Gyllenhaal', 'best', 'work', 'film', 'when', 'illustrating', 'Jack', 'tenderness', 'Ennis', 'three', 'key', 'scenes', 'occasion', 'second', 'intimate', 'encounter', 'afternoon', 'leave', 'mountain', 'last', 'meeting', 'tenderness', 'expressed', 'men', 'thing', 'rarely', 'seen', 'American', 'cinema', 'Additionally', 'adult', 'love', 'seldomly', 'been', 'depicted', 'film', 'as', 'convincingly', ""'Brokeback"", 'Mountain', 'probable', 'film', 'brief', 'last', 'line', 'hauntingly', 'delivered', 'Ledger', 'will', 'go', 'down', 'film', 'history', 'Ennis', 'finally', 'express', 'best', 'able', 'everything', 'felt', 'Jack', 'several', 'decades', 'three', 'terse', 'surging', 'terribly', 'sad', 'words.With', 'exception', 'children', 'Mountain', 'film', 'audiences', 'grand', 'thing', 'actually', 'discover', 'mature', 'intelligent', 'film', ""'adult"", 'best', 'sense', 'word', 'also', 'profound', 'highly', 'enjoyable', 'Mountain', 'proven', 'have', 'kind', 'healing', 'power', 'many', 'viewers', 'thus', 'film', 'audiences', 'potentially', 'gain', 'seeing']",N/A

Jack Twist (Jake Gyllenhaal) has worked for Joe Aguirre (Randy Quaid) before, and knows the routine. Take the flock of sheep up to Brokeback Mountain for the summer, watch over them, keep them safe, and return them at the end of the season. But Jack can't do the job alone and Joe hires Ennis Del Mar (Heath Ledger), a quiet, brooding fellow to run the base camp. Soon, the two men begin a relationship, finding companionship in each other's arms. At the end of the season, Jack thinks that maybe next year, or the year after, they can get a ranch together, and work it, making a nice life for themselves. Ennis is more concerned about public perception and reaction and can't make the jump into a relationship with Jack. Each gets married, Ennis to Alma (Michelle Williams) and Jack to Lureen (Anne Hathaway), and starts a family. One day, Jack rolls into town and the two lovers share a romantic weekend. Jack still wants them to run off together and start a ranch, but Ennis seems content to have these occasional weekends as he battles with his feelings about his true love.""Brokeback Mountain"", directed by Ang Lee (""Sense and Sensibility"", ""The Ice Storm"", ""Hulk"") and written by Larry McMurtry (""Lonesome Doves"") and Diana Ossana, based on a short story by E. Annie Proulx, is a very good film, with a lot of great things going for it.Perhaps the best things about the film are the performances by the two leads, Heath Ledger and Jake Gyllenhaal. If you have read any of my reviews of previous Heath Ledger films (""The Brothers Grimm"", ""Lords of Dogtown"", ""A Knight's Tale""), you know I am not a huge fan. But in ""Brokeback"", he is able to create a fully realized character, a character we can believe in and identify with; from the first moments, when he can barely look anyone in the eye, to his gradual acceptance of his partner, to actually talking to Jack we see Ennis develop and grow before our eyes. As the relationship and their lives become more complicated, Ledger helps us understand why Ennis believes the way he does. The relationship he builds with Jack starts as a confused coupling due to need and grows into something more profound and deep, at least through Ennis' eyes. The character is very complicated, and interesting to watch, and a lot of this is due to Ledger's performance. Based on his previous work, I would never have believed he was capable of such a performance. It is intense, interesting and riveting.Jake Gyllenhaal is also very good. Jack seems to be the more accepting member of the couple; he seems to have an inkling of who he is and what he needs, before the night they share in the tent. When that happens, Jack is also concerned and confused, but his love for Ennis allows him to have fantasies of them starting a ranch together. He is clearly disappointed when this doesn't happen, but moves on, getting married to Lureen in the process. Quickly, we see Jack has married Lureen primarily for the lifestyle she affords; her dad owns a large farm equipment dealership. After this point, whenever Jack and Ennis get together for a ""fishing weekend"", it is clear Jack is the better off financially, but his heart is also breaking away because he can't be in a relationship with the man he truly loves. Gyllenhaal's performance is so good because it hints at things we never learn for sure. Has Jack had male partners before? Is Ennis his first love?Director Ang Lee has an impressive resume of films. Each film is very different, yet explores the common theme of a relationship between two people. If you look at his diverse group of films, you realize that he is willing to try to new things and (usually) does them very well. From Jane Austen's England, to New England in the 80s, from modern day San Francisco to modern day New York, he seems to have a real sense for the time and place in each film's narrative. Yes, he did make ""Hulk"", a misguided effort, to say the least, but his other films have been exemplary in every regard. He uses great actors, great writing and great cinematography to fully realize each film. ""Brokeback Mountain"" is no exception. Equally stunning, equally challenging, and very different from his other films.The screenplay by Larry McMurtry and Diana Ossana, based on a story by E. Annie Proulx, captures the dialogue of the time and place brilliantly. As mentioned, Ennis doesn't talk a lot and much of his dialogue is grunted, but when he does speak, it is easy to see his speech is subdued by confusion, upbringing and the morals of the day. Jack is more vocal, but also confused. His dreams of living a happy life with Ennis are all the more heartbreaking, because we realize they will never happen. In an interview on NPR, McMurtry and Ossana discussed adapting Proulx's story to the big screen, leaving much of her dialogue and description intact. What they added was an elaboration on the domestic life of Ennis and Jack, detailing what life is like for each when they aren't together. Ennis' life is the more captivating of the two because we recognize how troubled and horrible his life with Alma is. Alma isn't a bad person, but the life they build together is hard to watch. Perhaps the best moment in the film happens when Alma realizes what Jack and Ennis do on those ""fishing trips"".I think the one thing missing for me is any scene depicting the intimacy they share for one another. Their first coupling is more of a `wham, bam, thank you, man' type of encounter, in their tent during a cold night. Later, after they reunite, they kiss forcefully, due to hunger, yearning. Throughout the course of their relationship, which runs twenty years, we see them together a few times, but few of these portray the intimacy they must have shared. Yes, they hug; one scene even shows them in bed together, talking, yet, there seems to be a lack of intimacy. Even in the time and place, despite their confusion, they still manage moments alone, yet we don't really get a sense of the physical side of their love.""Brokeback Mountain"" is a film filled with great performances, outstanding dialogue and beautiful cinematography. It will surely earn a handful of Oscar nominations.",4,Stellar Performances and Great Direction.,1134345600,"12 12, 2005",2005,6246,"['1963', 'Two', 'loner', 'cowboys', 'show', 'up', 'small',

172827,A3KJ6JAZPH382D,1417030321,"Tim Brough ""author and music buff""","[18, 23]","I know everyone keeps harping on ""Brokeback Mountain"" as the ""gay cowboy"" movie, but even as a gay man, there was so much more there that I was watching. ""Brokeback Mountain"" is a rare movie that portrays gay men realistically, perhaps one of the very few American Movies to do so. (""Philadelphia"" and ""Longtime Companion"" being the other two on a very short list.) Meet any committed couple that lives outside a metro area, and they will relate alot of the same experiences; the false marriages, the children they were terrified of abandoning, the constant fear of being discovered and the sad reconciling to yourself that your life is going to remain a tormented hetro-lie.To that extent, Heath Ledger completely captures the fear and self-terror that so many gay men who don't fit the cliche feel. After having his first explosion of desire in the mountains of Wyoming, he immediately stammers ""I ain't queer."" Ask any gay man over 40 about that incident, and I'd bet you over half could tell you of a similar situation that occurred in their own lives.But ""Brokeback Mountain"" is, again, of much greater substance than that. The script is an incredible, almost flawless economy of words and nuance. There is barely a wasted sentence or phrase in this movie. In fact, part of the drama is that there are so many long stretches of silence. (The initial meeting between Jack and Ennis, for instance.) The Annie Proulx short story to script adaptation by Larry McMurty and Diana Ossana is only deviated from in a couple short segments (Jack Twist's interaction with his in-laws, most notably), with many of the key passages are lifted verbatim. And that is a good thing.Perhaps more than the terrific script is that all the principle actors execute their parts so perfectly. Both Anne Hathaway, who shatters her teeny-pop image as the (at first, anyway) clueless deb that marries Jack, and Michelle Williams, as the long suffering soul that marries Ennis (who does one of the film's many heartbreaking moments as she - without a word - conveys shock, confusion and sudden sadness when she first sees Ennis encounter Jack) stand above their roles. Even the brief appearances (Jack's parents near the movie's end, Randy Quaid as the bloated, bigoted herd-owner) stay completely on target.To that end, it is interesting to note how many of the film's detractors hide their homophobia behind statements like ""this movie is just about an affair and how it ruins lives."" Yes, ""Brokeback Mountain"" is about an affair. But saying that it's just a cheater's movie is like saying that ""Hamlet"" is just a ghost story. There is a lot more going on here, the underscore of the forbidden and the tragedy of the unrealized life. When Anne Hathaway describes to Ennis the ""official"" story behind the returned letters from Jack while the true circumstances play out in a breif flashback (and thus complete an earlier foreshadowing in the film), you really feel the loss for everyone involved.Again, the triumph of ""Brokeback Mountain"" is its great story about the tragedy of an unrealized life. Funny how something this honest yet true gets hypocritically slammed and ranked from certain theaters, when gratuitous violent swill like ""Hostel"" enters moviehouses with an R.

The acting by all involved is exemplary and Ang Lee's direction is understated yet emphatic at the same time.I saw the first matinee of Brokeback Mountain here in Ottawa, Canada and at the end there was much sobbing and wimpering - mostly from the WOMEN in the audience.  That is how affecting this movie is to viewers of all sexual persuasions.  For that reason I believe the Academy Award for Best Picture was stolen from Brokeback Mountain because of the hidden homophobia still present in Hollywood, of all places!!  There must be more gays and lesbians per capita there than any other place on earth but it is the producers and the power elite who ultimately decide - in their own minds only - what is palatable and acceptable for the American ""unwashed"".  We must not forget the ""casting couch"" and the crypto-fags who produce and cast movies but are married with children yet still DEMAND sexual favours of all persuasions and perversions from aspiring AND established actors in order for them to get the parts.As a Canadian I was very proud of the cinematography of Banff and Jasper National Parks which stood in for Montana and the film is a glowing advertisement for the breathtaking scenery of those locations.  The rise in the tourist trade from the US of A must have skyrocketed after Americans realised the natural splendoursexisting north of our common border.The acting by Gylenhaal and especially Heath Ledger is outstanding.  Ledger carries the movie with his anguished non-communicativeness and the scene at the end with Jake's family  will tug at your heart and your mind.  Ledger's subdued and stylish acting there and at the very end is one of the best performances by an actor I have seen in a very long time.  HE should have gotten the Academy Award for Best Actor but then Philip Seymour Hoffman's portrayal of Truman Capote was very tough competition indeed.  It is too bad there was not a tie vote because they both demonstrated their consummate mastery of the art of acting.The female stars are also very good and since this is basically a family movie about love, longing, and lust their presence is essential.Every aficianado of fine cinema should run out to get this DVD and you don't have to be gay to appreciate its qualities.  It is a movie for everyone and speaks universal messages.Very, very highly recommended for ALL sexual persuasions.TIMOTHY WINGATE  Ottawa  CANADA",5,THE SORROW AND THE LONGING,1146873600,"05 6, 2006",2006,2521,"['superb', 'superlative', 'movie', 'one', 'saddest', 'most', 'uplifting', 'have', 'seen', 'very', 'very', 'long', 'time', 'acting', 'involved', 'exemplary', 'Ang', 'Lee', 'direction', 'understated', 'yet', 'emphatic', 'same', 'time.I', 'saw', 'first', 'matinee', 'Brokeback', 'Mountain', 'here', 'Ottawa', 'Canada', 'end', 'there', 'was', 'much', 'sobbing', 'wimpering', 'mostly', 'WOMEN', 'audience', 'how', 'affecting', 'movie', 'viewers', 'sexual', 'persuasions', 'reason', 'believe', 'Academy', 'Award', 'Best', 'Picture', 'was', 'stolen', 'Brokeback', 'Mountain', 'hidden', 'homophobia', 'still', 'present', 'Hollywood', 'places', 'must', 'be', 'more', 'gays', 'lesbians', 'capita', 'there', 'other', 'place', 'earth', 'producers', 'power', 'elite', 'who', 'ultimately', 'decide', 'own', 'minds', 'only', 'what', 'palatable', 'acceptable', 'American', 'unwashed', 'must', 'not', 'forget', 'casting', 'couch', 'crypto-fags', 'who', 'produce', 'cast', 'movies', 'are', 'married', 'children', 'yet', 'still', 'DEMAND', 'sexual', 'favours', 'persuasions', 'perversions', 'aspiring', 'established', 'actors', 'order', 'get', 'parts.As', 'Canadian', 'was', 'very', 'proud', 'cinematography', 'Banff', 'Jasper', 'National', 'Parks', 'stood', 'Montana', 'film', 'glowing', 'advertisement', 'breathtaking', 'scenery', 'locations', 'rise', 'tourist', 'trade', 'US', 'A', 'must', 'have', 'skyrocketed', 'Americans', 'realised', 'natural', 'splendoursexisting', 'north', 'common', 'border.The', 'acting', 'Gylenhaal', 'especially', 'Heath', 'Ledger', 'outstanding', 'Ledger', 'movie', 'anguished', 'non-communicativeness', 'scene', 'end', 'Jake', 'family', 'will', 'tug', 'heart', 'mind', 'Ledger', 'subdued', 'stylish', 'acting', 'there', 'very', 'end', 'one', 'best', 'performances', 'actor', 'have', 'seen', 'very', 'long', 'time', 'HE', 'should', 'have', 'gotten', 'Academy', 'Award', 'Best', 'Actor', 'then', 'Philip', 'Seymour', 'Hoffman', 'portrayal', 'Truman', 'Capote', 'was', 'very', 'tough', 'competition', 'indeed', 'too', 'bad', 'there', 'was', 'not', 'tie', 'vote', 'demonstrated', 'consummate', 'mastery', 'art', 'acting.The', 'female', 'stars', 'are', 'also', 'very', 'good', 'basically', 'family', 'movie', 'love', 'longing', 'lust', 'presence', 'essential.Every', 'aficianado', 'fine', 'cinema', 'should', 'run', 'out', 'get', 'DVD', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'be', 'gay', 'appreciate', 'qualities', 'movie', 'everyone', 'speaks', 'universal', 'messages.Very', 'very', 'highly', 'recommended', 'ALL', 'sexual', 'persuasions.TIMOTHY', 'WINGATE', 'Ottawa', 'CANADA']",N/A

Maybe some people feel justified that this love affair leads to sheer heartache and misery.  Ultimately, I think the secret to this film's success is that it gives us so much to think about.I was initially disappointed by what seems to be a lack of romance on the screen.  It's almost as if the filmmakers wanted to establish the relationship between these two men, but didn't want to push it on the audience.  The couple doesn't spend time gazing into each other's eyes, and they never even say those three little words to each other.  What they mostly do is talk about why they can't be together--which is basically what this film is about.  Even though their love often seems incomplete, we still know it's there.  When these poor souls are apart, the anguish and frustration they feel manifests itself in almost every aspect of their lives.Jake Gyllenhaal is wonderful in this movie, but Ledger's portrayal of Ennis is literally beyond words.  He brings us a character who is handcuffed by society and his fear of being exposed, but we also get to know him as someone who is as assertive as he is reticent, and as strong as he is vulnerable.

172832,A26LIR24MAM6VQ,1417030321,"todd rich ""scoop 69""","[22, 26]","Every so often , a film is released that breaks all of the barriers and plunges deep beneath the power of cinema and spreads messages of hope in love. This isn't the film. "" Brokeback Mountain "" isn't a film that shows us something new. It isn't a film that provides a new message to the masses. This film's magic and strengths aren't in the message. This film's power is in the performances , cinematography , directing , and the unforgettable acting. Penned by Larry McMurtry ( Lonesome Dove ) and Diana Ossana , this film was highly anticipated to sweep the 2005 Oscars. It was well recieved and was in fact nominated for 8 Academy Awards. Ironically , it did win 3 Oscars but lost Best Picture to another phenominally well acted film , entitled "" Crash "". Personally , I belive that Heath Ledger should've recieved an Oscar for his performance as Best Actor. Originally , "" Brokeback Mountain "" was pegged as a gay cowboy flick. Even if it was , that still wouldn't be new. John Voight did a gay scene in 1969's "" Midnight Cowboy "" , Matthew Broderick did it in 1988's ""Torch Song Trilogy "", Harry Hamlin did it in 1982's "" Making Love "", Tom Berringer did it in 1977's "" Looking for Mr. Goodbar "", Robbie benson did it in 1976's "" Ode to Billy Joe "" , the late actor Brad Davis did it in 1978's ""Midnight Express"".Hollywood has done everything a million times. Nothing has been rediscovered or invented here. However , this film retells the power of love with a rare and unflinching sensativity. Just so happens that instead of ""the poor boy that can't fall in love with the rich girl "" , it's "" the boy can't fall in love with the other boy "". However , the unforgettable moments come from the actors and their stunning, sensitive,  and unforgettable portrayals. Heath Ledger and Jake Gyllenhaal, portray two cowhands , hired to watch cattle on a mountian , during the winter in the 1960's. Isolated , lonely , young , and reliant on each other in the rugged wilderness , the two begin a love affair that spans the rest of the their lives. Unfortunatly , their love has to remain a secret because of their own denials and the prejudices , fears , and ignorance towards homosexuality from outsiders. Ang Lee does a phenominal job at directing , Rodrigo Prieto does an unforgettable job as the film's cinematographer and Gustavo Santaolalla provides a musical score that will always be remembered in a haunting connection to the film. Persoanlly , I had my own prejudices towards the film , prior to me seeing it. However , I truly believe that this is a very rare film because it succeeds in telling a message that wouldn't normally be recognized in a typical love story. It spreads the awareness of ignorance and intollerance and ultimately makes it personal by illustrating the power of self destruction through fear and denial. "" Brokeback Mountain "" is an unforgettable film , and I highly recommend it.

172833,A233QN6P2EEKPS,1417030321,Tom Collier,"[33, 41]","During the first twenty minutes or so of Ang Lee's Brokeback Mountain, we are introduced to Ennis and Jack, two cowboys watching over sheep in Wyoming. Ennis, a sulky, quiet redneck type, feels right at home being a cowboy. Bright eyed and chatty, Jack seems like he would have been better off growing up in the city. The two men watch over the sheep, hunt, and get to know each other. The film plays these scenes in a straightforward, simple manner, and if not for the massive hype surrounding the film's content, it would be a total shock when they begin to have sex.Quiet subtlety is Brokeback Mountain's greatest asset. If a hundred directors were assigned to make a film about gay cowboys, it is doubtful that many would be more subtle than Ang Lee. The film does not take great pains to show us they are in love, nor does it twelve scenes where the characters spell out their every thought with tears streaming down their faces, nor does it stick around for soft pornography. The majority of what is going in is expressed in the characters faces, actions, and simple but effective dialogue. Heath Leder turns in a phenomenal performance as Ennis, who even when in a moment of peace, seems to be in agony. Jake Gyllenhaal is nearly as good as Jack, who impatiently wades through his life, waiting for the happiness he knows must be around the corner.Ennis and Jack part when the summer is over, Ennis staying in Wyoming, Jack moving to Texas. Neither one is overly enthused about their lives, which include wives and children, but they carry on. One day, Ennis receives a postcard from Jack, and before you know it the two are going on ""fishing trips"" where no fishing takes place. Jack declares that the two should leave their families and get a farm together, but Ennis quietly scoffs. It is still the 1960's, and as a boy, his father showed him firsthand the potentially violent death that can await a homosexual.Brokeback Mountain is not so much about homosexuality or love as it is unfulfilled desire. Jack can not have what he badly wants, and Ennis' is not willing to take the steps towards his own possible happiness. The film is not nearly as pro-homosexuality as some would have you believe; indeed, throughout the film, Ennis and Jack's relationship destroys their own lives and badly damages that of others. Instead of giving into their desires or suppressing them entirely, they try halfway, which does not work.  In one scene, Ennis ignores his own children in his desperation to run off to a motel with Jack. In another, Jack slinks through a Mexican border town, searching for a male prostitute. These are not happy men, certainly not the characters GLAAD would push.Brokeback Mountain is a magnificent story of men doomed by impulses they would each rather not possess. One's own opinions of the politics and morality of homosexuality need not matter much, as everyone can connect to the pain of not having what it is you want most. Is there any feeling much worse than that?",4,Powerful tale of desire unfulfilled,1144022400,"04 3, 2006",2006,2997,"['first', 'twenty', 'minutes', 'so', 'Ang', 'Lee', 'Brokeback', 'Mountain', 'are', 'introduced', 'Ennis', 'Jack', 'two', 'cowboys', 'watching', 'over', 'sheep', 'Wyoming', 'Ennis', 'sulky', 'quiet', 'redneck', 'type', 'feels', 'right', 'home', 'being', 'cowboy', 'Bright', 'eyed', 'chatty', 'Jack', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'better', 'growing', 'up', 'city', 'two', 'men', 'watch', 'sheep', 'hunt', 'get', 'know', 'other', 'film', 'scenes', 'straightforward', 'simple', 'manner', 'not', 'massive', 'hype', 'surrounding', 'film', 'content', 'would', 'be', 'total', 'shock', 'when', 'begin', 'have', 'sex.Quiet', 'subtlety', 'Brokeback', 'Mountain', 'greatest', 'asset', 'hundred', 'directors', 'were', 'assigned', 'make', 'film', 'gay', 'cowboys', 'doubtful', 'many', 'would', 'be', 'more', 'subtle', 'Ang', 'Lee', 'film', 'not', 'take', 'great', 'pains', 'show', 'are', 'love', 'twelve', 'scenes', 'where', 'characters', 'spell', 'out', 'thought', 'tears', 'streaming', 'down', 'stick', 'around', 'soft', 'pornography', 'majority', 'what', 'going', 'expressed', 'characters', 'actions', 'simple', 'effective', 'dialogue', 'Heath', 'Leder', 'phenomenal', 'performance', 'Ennis', 'who', 'even', 'when', 'moment', 'peace', 'be', 'agony', 'Jake', 'Gyllenhaal', 'nearly', 'as', 'good', 'Jack', 'who', 'impatiently', 'life', 'waiting', 'happiness', 'must', 'be', 'corner.Ennis', 'Jack', 'part', 'when', 'summer', 'Ennis', 'staying', 'Wyoming', 'Jack', 'moving', 'Texas', 'one', 'overly', 'enthused', 'lives', 'include', 'wives', 'children', 'carry', 'One', 'day', 'Ennis', 'postcard', 'Jack', 'know', 'two', 'are', 'going', 'fishing', 'trips', 'where', 'fishing', 'place', 'Jack', 'two', 'should', 'leave', 'families', 'get', 'farm', 'together', 'Ennis', 'quietly', 'still', '1960', 'boy', 'father', 'showed', 'firsthand', 'potentially', 'violent', 'death', 'can', 'await', 'homosexual.Brokeback', 'Mountain', 'not', 'so', 'much', 'homosexuality', 'love', 'unfulfilled', 'desire', 'Jack', 'can', 'not', 'have', 'what', 'badly', 'Ennis', 'not', 'willing', 'take', 'steps', 'own', 'possible', 'happiness', 'film', 'not', 'nearly', 'as', 'pro-homosexuality', 'would', 'have', 'believe', 'indeed', 'film', 'Ennis', 'Jack', 'relationship', 'own', 'lives', 'badly', 'damages', 'others', 'Instead', 'giving', 'desires', 'suppressing', 'entirely', 'try', 'halfway', 'not', 'work', 'one', 'scene', 'Ennis', 'own', 'children', 'desperation', 'run', 'off', 'motel', 'Jack', 'Jack', 'Mexican', 'border', 'town', 'searching', 'male', 'prostitute', 'are', 'not', 'happy', 'men', 'certainly', 'not', 'characters', 'GLAAD', 'would', 'push.Brokeback', 'Mountain', 'magnificent', 'story', 'men', 'doomed', 'impulses', 'would', 'rather', 'not', 'possess', 'One', 'own', 'opinions', 'politics', 'morality', 'homosexuality', 'need', 'not', 'matter', 'much', 'everyone', 'can', 'connect', 'pain', 'not', 'having', 'what', 'want', 'most', 'there', 'feeling', 'much', 'worse']",N/A

Relationship drama is always Lee's strength and the move to direct the Hulk movie could be regarded as one of the biggest mistakes in his directing career.Brokeback Mountain could be said as a continuation Lee Ang's attempt to read into a gay loving story. Wedding Banquet is one of his major successes. It precisely nailed down the dilemmas of a how a gay American Chinese tried to act straight in front of his parents, even going to the extent of having a fake wedding to satisfy the expectations of his family. In Brokeback Mountain, two guys deeply in love in a forbidden age within a forbidding profession. Heath Ledger gave his prime performance as the cowboy with little words Ennis. He is bad in expressing his emotions and the only emotion he could exhibit is his anger. Ennis' lack of speech and strong social conscious immediately place the undying relationship into the grave right from the start. Jake Gyllenhaal plays brilliantly as the part of Jack, who in his whole life try to make the relationship work at all cost. They met, they part and all they can look forward to is an opportunity to meet again, sometime. For Ennis and Jack, each departure could mean forever. It's stressful, heartbreaking and sad. This could be summed up by Jack's monologue ""I wish I could quit you...all we have left is the Brokeback Mountain"" It's an addiction that both parties cannot quit, but at the same time cannot uphold.Michelle Williams showcasted a power performance as Ennis' wife, who accidentally discovered her husband's real love. Devastated, heartbroken but determined to stay silence for many years. I read that she was disowned by her high school because of her participation in the project. But a high school ownership doesn't mean anything for an actor to have such a breathtaking and memorable performance (maybe her high school should disown every single graduate who went through a divorce then).Brokeback Mountain certainly marks a performance of an outstanding cast with an outstanding story. The dialogues are so well written that they completely and tightly tie the plot together. Heath Ledger is different as Nicole Kidman is different in The Hours. Jake Gyllenhall once again proved that he is one of the best young talents in Hollywood.

172841,ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T,1417030321,Tsuyoshi,"[34, 45]","It is wonderful to see Ang Lee come back with `Brokeback Mountain,' beautifully-shot, heart-rending drama about two cowboys and their forbidden love. Some of you might find the film's theme not so attractive at first, but don't worry, the film can be appreciated as a love story, and a very good and nuanced one too.The quiet opening section is the strongest part, where Ennis (Heath Ledger) and Jack (Jake Gyllenhaal) are hired to guard the sheep in the mountains in the early 1960s. The sparse use of dialogues and soundtrack enhance the emotional tension between them, with a help from the stunning photography of Rodrigo Prieto, who captures the serene beauty of Brokeback Mountain,Then we meet Ennis and Jack four years later, both married and with children. While Jack considers the possibility of living together, Ennis, who recounts a horrible episode from his childhood memories, evades the topic altogether, suggesting his repressed fear about the consequences of such a life. However, as time goes by - and the film covers about 20 years of their life -- their hidden (so they believe) relations inevitably influence those around them, especially the life of Alma (Michelle Williams), Ennis's wife.First and foremost, `Brokeback Mountain' is a success as the poignant love story between Ennis and Jack. Jake Gyllenhaal is good as Jack, clearly more seductive of the two, but it is Heath Ledger who embodies the sadness of these two lovers. Ennis is a good example of a lonely soul, who knows nothing about his own life except that he messed it up somewhere in the past.Female roles are less impressive though Michelle Williams shines as tormented wife of Ennis. Ann Hathaway plays Laureen, Jack's wife, but talented as she is, I think the NYC-born actress is miscast as Texas girl. (And there are brief nudity of them, which is totally unnecessary here.) Anna Faris, Linda Cardellini, and Kate Mara also appear, but with the exception of Kate Mara, who plays the daughter of Ennis and seeks for the love of her father, the good cast is largely wasted.`Brokeback Mountain' is not without flaws. Perhaps it could have been better with more time to tell the story, but the emotional power of the central theme is strong all the same, and the end results of their story are simply overwhelming.",5,"Love Story, Potent and Nuanced",1146182400,"04 28, 2006",2006,2301,"['wonderful', 'see', 'Ang', 'Lee', 'come', 'back', 'Brokeback', 'Mountain', 'beautifully-shot', 'heart-rending', 'drama', 'two', 'cowboys', 'forbidden', 'love', 'might', 'find', 'film', 'theme', 'not', 'so', 'attractive', 'first', 'do', ""n't"", 'worry', 'film', 'can', 'be', 'appreciated', 'love', 'story', 'very', 'good', 'nuanced', 'one', 'too.The', 'quiet', 'opening', 'section', 'strongest', 'part', 'where', 'Ennis', 'Heath', 'Ledger', 'Jack', 'Jake', 'Gyllenhaal', 'are', 'hired', 'guard', 'sheep', 'mountains', 'early', '1960s', 'sparse', 'use', 'dialogues', 'soundtrack', 'enhance', 'emotional', 'tension', 'help', 'stunning', 'photography', 'Rodrigo', 'Prieto', 'who', 'serene', 'beauty', 'Brokeback', 'Mountain', 'Then', 'meet', 'Ennis', 'Jack', 'four', 'years', 'later', 'married', 'children', 'Jack', 'possibility', 'living', 'together', 'Ennis', 'who', 'horrible', 'episode', 'childhood', 'memories', 'topic', 'altogether', 'suggesting', 'repressed', 'fear', 'consequences', 'life', 'However', 'time', 'film', '20', 'years', 'life', 'hidden', 'believe', 'relations', 'inevitably', 'influence', 'especially', 'life', 'Alma', 'Michelle', 'Williams', 'Ennis', 'wife.First', 'foremost', 'Brokeback', 'Mountain', 'success', 'poignant', 'love', 'story', 'Ennis', 'Jack', 'Jake', 'Gyllenhaal', 'good', 'Jack', 'clearly', 'more', 'seductive', 'two', 'Heath', 'Ledger', 'who', 'sadness', 'two', 'lovers', 'Ennis', 'good', 'example', 'lonely', 'soul', 'who', 'nothing', 'own', 'life', 'messed', 'up', 'somewhere', 'past.Female', 'roles', 'are', 'less', 'impressive', 'Michelle', 'Williams', 'shines', 'tormented', 'wife', 'Ennis', 'Ann', 'Hathaway', 'Laureen', 'Jack', 'wife', 'talented', 'think', 'NYC-born', 'actress', 'miscast', 'Texas', 'girl', 'are', 'brief', 'nudity', 'totally', 'unnecessary', 'here', 'Anna', 'Faris', 'Linda', 'Cardellini', 'Kate', 'Mara', 'also', 'appear', 'exception', 'Kate', 'Mara', 'who', 'daughter', 'Ennis', 'love', 'father', 'good', 'cast', 'largely', 'wasted.', 'Brokeback', 'Mountain', 'not', 'flaws', 'Perhaps', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'better', 'more', 'time', 'tell', 'story', 'emotional', 'power', 'central', 'theme', 'strong', 'same', 'end', 'results', 'story', 'are', 'simply', 'overwhelming']",N/A
172842,ANN4JW1E08AS6,1417030321,tuberacer,"[5, 10]","Heath Ledger does an amazing transformation performance. He is so in character, you know who this guy is. You've seen him around on the American landscape. A very reserved, quiet young man raised in the back roads amongst pain and prejudice--a man who has gained strength simply by enduring while avoiding becoming another of the perpetrators--but that strength also clamps down around him and shuts him up. He is trapped in his strength and much of his energy is simpy spent on keeping his tightly knotted self-preservation intact.. Along comes Jack Twist.That first sexual encounter really comes out of left field. There wasn't anything beforehand that suggested that we should expect it or that those kinds of feelings, whatever those feelings were supposed to be, were growing in these characters, and I'd say that was the film's one big flaw. There was no real sense of a romance brewing, nor even lust--at least, not in the Ennis character and only very faint hints in the Jack character. Perhaps that was Ang Lee's bowing down to the reality of what the mass audience would tolerate, or upon what the film studio would tolerate considering the financial risk. Or maybe it was simply that that particular kind of romance is such uncharted territory in a major motion picture that both the movie maker and the mass audience are at a complete loss to negotiate any conventional terms for portraying it. The shared visual lexicon in film simply doesn't have the conventions yet to portray this kind of ""romance,"" so only with baby steps, film by film, can the  journey into this territory begin. Female gay romance has been dealt with many more times than male gay romance in mainstream film. Actually, I can only think of one or two films before this one that has made the attempt.What Lee uses is a mixture of passion and brutality to depict their early relationship, but does that actually reveal their deep affection? Under their circumstances, for these two characters, maybe it does. Maybe their interiors are so tightly bound up by exteriors of cultural and self-inflicted constrictions that only on the back of violence can the two interiors break through to each other. But to buy this first sex scene you'd almost have to buy into some kind of undetectable telepathy that's been going on between Ennis and Jack because you certainly don't see any real evidence of anything brewing at this level before the tent scene. And actually, the why's and wherefore's of the attraction are never really revealed in the film, especially for Ennis, and Ennis's later excitement at seeing Jack and then running headlong into passion with him also seemed out of character. He wasn't ""queer,"" he had said earlier.  What happened? The interiors of these homosexual feelings are not really explored at all. It all just happens. And as someone else has mentioned, that first sex scene does, in a way, reinforce stereotypes about gay sex, and also suggests that the situation is not unfamiliar to Ennis since he seems to know about, and  go right into, the expected action. This is strange since we're never given any suggestion of a history of previous gay encounters for Ennis. On the contrary, he's about to, matter-of-factly, marry a woman. There are moments in this tale, though, when you see it really is about love, just basic love--moments which may take non-gays (like myself) out of any prevailing prejudices for a few heartbeats and see that it truly is possible.The level of drama in this film is exceptional. This is very sophisticated story telling using the film medium. Lee proves again his remarkable resourcefulness and ability to focus sharply on subject matter that one would not expect from someone from a completely different culture. The depiction of the west/midwest here is deep and very convincing. You would think this could only be the product of an American movie maker.

First it's really the first gay love story (if you want to call it a love story) to go mainstream, second it's got two pulitzer prize winners and Ang Lee involved, third it's got the best acting I have ever seen on film, and when you mix everything together you get the most professional adaptation of a written work I wouldn't want to say ever done, but it certainly might be.You probably know the story by now, so I won't go on with plot summeries, but I will tell you what made me attend this film 4 times at the theater:As an English major this movie was like literary heaven.  After the first time I watched it I was blown away by all the foreshadow, symbolism, parallels, and poetric transitions that this film did perfectly.  For instance, Jack always misses what he ""shoots"" (coyote, deer) but Ennis hits them.  In a sense Ennis has ""hit"" Jack, but Jack can never really ""hit"" Ennis.At the end of one scene Alma throws down mail and the camera captures an ad for Honey.  In the next seen Jack says ""Honey"" to his wife.  What a great Poetic transition!There are many parallels, most notably that embrace from behind.  Jack and Ennis do it twice, once while in the motel and another during the flashback when Jack is ""sleeping like a horse.""  Alma also embraces Ennis from behind in the first bedroom scene when she wants to move into town.  Even the their two shirts together in the end can be considered an embrace from behind.Jack foreshadows his outcome by wearing purple in one scene.I could go on and on and on with all the fun English and Literary goodies I found by watching the movie--trust me, I took pen and paper into the theater and filled up 5 front-and-back pages of notes.

Its not an explicit film, it is all done extremely well and directed beautifully and tastefully. Ang Lee is a favorite of mine, especially after Sense and Sensibility.

First, this film does NOT contain a bunch of gay sex scenes! This film is NOT anti-family values (what the hell are ""family values,"" anyway?), and this movie does not promote the ""gay agenda!""I am heterosexual. I am not gay, none of my friends are gay (at least that I know of), and I have no gay family members that I know of either. One should not have to make this disclaimer, but anti-gay activists are accusing those who like this movie of having an agenda. Having said that, I thought Brokeback Mountain was fantastic. This might possibly be the best film I've seen in the theaters so far in 2006, and after watching the film, I spent weeks on end thinking about the content of the film. Great movies have a way of making viewers do that.Heath Ledger and Jake Gyllenhall first meet in Wyoming in 1963 when both are in their early 20s looking for summer work. They end up finding employment with a local sheep herder, and in the process, find out a thing or two about themselves. The two develop feelings for one another, but under the anti-gay socialization each has been raised with, quickly attempt to suppress these emotions.At the end of the summer, each man returns to his hometown to pursue his respective life. Ledger gets married and has two daughters, while Gyllenhall returns to Texas and meets a cowgirl at a tavern. They get married and have a son.However, Ledger and Gyllenhall end up meeting up again several years later. Emotions are rekindled, leading to complications in their relationships with their respective families and each other.This movie shows the mental anguish and emotional turmoil that results from being forced to live a double life at the hands of society. The film actually made me rethink and reconsider a lot of the stereotypes that I held towarards homosexuals, and Brokeback Mountain is an important and timely film.Everyone I know who saw this film in the theater thinks it is phenomenal. There is great acting, and the cinematography is breathtaking: herds of sheep flocking about the screen, the mountains and lakes of the Rocky Mountains, and the rugged terrain and cornfields of Texas. At the end of the day, Brokeback Mountain is as much or even more a Western film (not a ""gay film"" that its bashers would have us believe) than anything else.

I thought this movie was slow and dull, and obviously letdown because of all the hype. However, I recently decided to watch it again--three years later--and I don't know why I had the reaction I did the first time.

There's nothing more that could be wanted though, and I know that now. This truly is a great story.The acting is brilliant from everyone in this film! I think the first time I watched this movie I should have turned the volume up because Heath Leger's character mumbles a bit--he's a man of few words.

A story about how you should always be true to yourself and the one you love.

True, the characters are cowboys, but gay people are like everyone else, and they are everywhere and every type of person. Some people have a problem with this movie because it deals with homosexuality, but they have their own issues and miss the point of this movie entirely.I was letdown the first time I watched this movie, and there are reasons for it, but I'm not letdown now. The only thing that lets me down is I wasn't able to enjoy this completely the first time, and I've only seen the movie twice in three years, but I'm sure I'll be watching it constantly from now on.This movie is beautiful and tragic.

Elegant as it is, this film slowly, systematically tears you apart, leaving you feeling as barren, ragged and yet as moved as the characters.The acting from every single character is true.  I think Michelle Williams' performance is a spectacular revelation, who knew that a second banana from a teen melodrama series could act with such depth and restraint and emotional power. The shattering of her illusions is at least as soul destroying as that of the main characters.  And Anne Hathaway has a tremendous moment towards the end; in a few minutes she injects 20 years of tamped down pain and bitterness, yet through that pain, she projects a sympathy for someone else's tragedy which is unexpected, yet still in character.  The performances in this film are truly the best I've seen by a group of actors.

Red,"[9, 37]","I feel I must explain four stars rather than five; there is so much hype about this movie -- not only in the culture at large but here on amazon.com.Yes, it is a great movie. Heath Ledger as Ennis especially does an amazing job of conveying the pain that is exacted from repressing his love for another man. It remains unclear if the entrance of Jack into his life liberated him into understanding who he really was or created a heartbreaking problem for him as he became unable to function in his relationship with his wife and, to some extent, his daughters. The film is to be commended for allowing that kind of ambiguity to exist.Heath Ledger and Michelle Williams (who plays his wife Alma) do a really impressive job together of showing how corrosive a competing passion can be to a relationship that starts out with love, respect, and even some attraction. I believed most fully in Jack's and Ennis's love when I saw how eager Ennis was to leave his wife and go off fishing with his lover. The film understands that passion always exists in a social context.But I was expecting to be more deeply moved by that passion, between Ennis and Jack, which is the basic premise of the film. Without that, you have nothing, and I just didn't feel the chemistry. Even after watching this film with all the best intentions in the world, I didn't really feel the basic pull that would draw this one specific man to  the other. I didn't feel it in the script as the characters were developed, and I didn't feel it on screen in their love scenes. There, I felt like I was watching two straight men on the screen perform sexual acts on each other that made me uncomfortable. Is that about me, a straight woman? Maybe. But I actually got a more developed sense of love between men from watching the interesting domestic relationship of Truman Capote and Jack Dunphy (Philip Seymour Hoffman and Bruce Greenwood) in the film ""Capote"" (which I personally think should have won best film) than I got here, even though there was no kissing in that movie.In the end, I was disappointed with the number of cliched tricks that Ang Lee resorted to in order to finish off this film, for instance Ennis endlessly smelling and kissing Jack's shirt. Don't get me wrong: It's a very good film. It's only a beginning, though. Here's a question: Why cast two straight men in these parts? I just don't think they had it in them to convey to a receptive audience what it means for a man to love a man. I'm still waiting for the movie that will do that for me.",4,"Really liked it, not totally convinced",1145491200,"04 20, 2006",2006,2531,"['feel', 'must', 'explain', 'four', 'stars', 'rather', 'five', 'so', 'much', 'hype', 'movie', 'not', 'only', 'culture', 'large', 'here', 'amazon.com.Yes', 'great', 'movie', 'Heath', 'Ledger', 'Ennis', 'especially', 'amazing', 'job', 'conveying', 'pain', 'exacted', 'repressing', 'love', 'man', 'unclear', 'entrance', 'Jack', 'life', 'liberated', 'understanding', 'who', 'really', 'was', 'created', 'heartbreaking', 'problem', 'became', 'unable', 'function', 'relationship', 'wife', 'extent', 'daughters', 'film', 'be', 'commended', 'allowing', 'kind', 'ambiguity', 'exist.Heath', 'Ledger', 'Michelle', 'Williams', 'who', 'wife', 'Alma', 'do', 'really', 'impressive', 'job', 'together', 'showing', 'how', 'corrosive', 'competing', 'passion', 'can', 'be', 'relationship', 'out', 'love', 'respect', 'even', 'attraction', 'believed', 'most', 'fully', 'Jack', 'Ennis', 'love', 'when', 'saw', 'how', 'eager', 'Ennis', 'was', 'leave', 'wife', 'go', 'off', 'fishing', 'lover', 'film', 'passion', 'always', 'social', 'context.But', 'was', 'expecting', 'be', 'more', 'deeply', 'moved', 'passion', 'Ennis', 'Jack', 'basic', 'premise', 'film', 'have', 'nothing', 'just', 'did', ""n't"", 'feel', 'chemistry', 'Even', 'watching', 'film', 'best', 'intentions', 'world', 'did', ""n't"", 'really', 'feel', 'basic', 'pull', 'would', 'draw', 'one', 'specific', 'man', 'other', 'did', ""n't"", 'feel', 'script', 'characters', 'were', 'developed', 'did', ""n't"", 'feel', 'screen', 'love', 'scenes', 'felt', 'was', 'watching', 'two', 'straight', 'men', 'screen', 'perform', 'sexual', 'acts', 'other', 'made', 'uncomfortable', 'straight', 'woman', 'Maybe', 'actually', 'got', 'more', 'developed', 'sense', 'love', 'men', 'watching', 'interesting', 'domestic', 'relationship', 'Truman', 'Capote', 'Jack', 'Dunphy', 'Philip', 'Seymour', 'Hoffman', 'Bruce', 'Greenwood', 'film', 'Capote', 'personally', 'think', 'should', 'have', 'won', 'best', 'film', 'got', 'here', 'even', 'was', 'kissing', 'end', 'was', 'disappointed', 'number', 'cliched', 'tricks', 'Ang', 'Lee', 'resorted', 'order', 'finish', 'off', 'film', 'instance', 'Ennis', 'endlessly', 'smelling', 'kissing', 'Jack', 'shirt', 'Do', ""n't"", 'get', 'wrong', 'very', 'good', 'film', 'only', 'beginning', 'though', 'Here', 'question', 'Why', 'cast', 'two', 'straight', 'men', 'parts', 'just', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'had', 'convey', 'receptive', 'audience', 'what', 'man', 'love', 'man', ""'m"", 'still', 'waiting', 'movie', 'will', 'do']",N/A

I never saw a movie with Heath Ledger either. I thought he did an excellent job as a man in great conflict with his bi-sexual desires which were a death sentence in the early 60's. Also as with other reviewers, the problem with Ledger was that I could NOT UNDERSTAND 80% OF WHAT HE WAS SAYING! He seemed to be channeling Tommy Lee Jones' voice.SPOILER ALERT:Several things were not clear.1. Did Ennis's wife ever fully come out and tell him she knew of his relation with Jack?2. Did Jack's wife know how he really died? Or was the flat tire accident just a cover-up for the good of the family so there would not be a scandal ?3. Were Jack's ashes in the paper bag with the shirt his mom gave Ennis? Did Ennis take them to Brokeback Mountain?4. Heath Ledger mumbles. Does anyone know what he said at the end of the movie to Jack's shirt?I would give this movie a 5 having been compelled to watch it so many times.

At some level, I guess, it's just a matter of adding my affirmation to what others have said. My most enthusiastic affirmation. This is a great film. It's not great just because the acting is good. Though it is. It's not great just because the cinematography is wonderful. Though it is. It's not great just because it puts a taboo subject on the big screen at a time when Americans need to face a whole variety of realities about themselves. Though you bet it does that too.It's great because the story just makes sense. Annie Proulx has looked into an unfortunate aspect of American culture - our reticence to acknowledge that love and affection doesn't fit into easy, cultural-correct cubicles - and she's told a story that in one way or another must have been lived and relived again and again by a great many people. All the characters in this movie get full and sympathetic treatment. Yes, that begins with Ennis and Jack, but it goes beyond them to include everyone unfortunate enough to be caught up in the repressive society this film details. They're all victims - wives and children included. And it just makes sense! You can totally understand why people would live the lives these characters do, unable to love themselves or those around them naturally, because of pressures from a close-minded, fearful society.I came home from this film wondering if other actors could've done a better job than Ledger and Gyllenhaal, only to find an old Mel Gibson movie on the box. I was painfully aware of how poor an actor someone like Gibson is in comparison to these two young, talented men. I was also painfully aware of how brave they are, and how someone like Gibson would never have done a film like this. It actually makes me - usually a cynic when it comes to Hollywood - enthusiastic about the future of mainstream American filmmaking. Every now and then we get something right.

Having read Annie Proulx's short story from which the movie was taken first, I can testify to the movie's phenomenally accurate, delicate and moving translation into film.What angers me beyond belief is all the adolescent, giggly jokes we had to endure for how many weeks? On every late-night show, and even at the Oscars themselves, absolutely everybody had a ""gay cowboy"" joke. But that's not what this story is about at all. Not even close.The intense unbreakable bond between Jack and Ennis examines the very essence of being human. Meeting at age 19, each has already been weathered by unspeakably harsh conditions, both environtally and spiritually. Ennis barely speaks. Jack is guarded and wary. On a summer looking after sheep in a starkly remote area of Wyoming, they are the only two human beings on the planet. And a bond between them forms and grows into something neither wants, but neither can break.Gosh, yuck yuck, let's get Jay Leno to make some more jokes! Or maybe, just maybe, those who haven't seen this movie can put aside their preordained ""opinions"" and just watch it unfold.Incredible directing by Ang Lee, incredible writing, spectacular photography and acting (Heath Ledger is incredibly talented as Ennis, in what might be the role of his career, but all the actors are superb), and lush, gorgeous music are all part of the whole--Brokeback Mountain is a masterpiece.My one tiny criticism of the DVD itself is that the music seems to drown out the dialogue, some of which is so soft that it is impossible to hear without turning the volume way up.

172859,A17JVVAKWEB0M,1417030321,Wesley Mullins,"[14, 20]","In a town that could not be smaller and under a sky that could not be greater, Ennis and Jack find each other.  Out of work cattle hands, both make their way to the same rancher's office.  They get assigned to Brokeback Mountain, wrangling a herd of sheep so large it seems to stretch from Texas to Canada.  After many weeks with only each other's companionship and one night of heavy drinking, the two suddenly and violently have sex.I assume viewers know that is coming, as much as they knew Jesus was doomed in Mel Gibson's picture.  Brokeback Mountain has already become a cultural phenomenon as ""the gay cowboy"" film, so everyone knows the two will eventually play ""hide the lasso"".  Two things about that introduction surprised me.  First, I did not expect the shepherding to be presently so beautifully.  The two men and the endless herd of sheep echoes the relationship of Gus and Call from Lonesome Dove (another story penned by Larry McMurtry) as they drive cattle to Montana.  The vistas fill the screen with a world of infinite space and glory, with two little cowboys as only specs hidden among the evergreens and icy ponds.The second surprise for me was the lack of tenderness in their relationship before they had sex.  Someone not expecting them to become lovers will be shocked, as nothing suggests they have those feelings.  They just wake up in the middle of the night and go at it.  Maybe that's a heterosexual's opinion, because if one of the boys had been camped out with Natalie Portman that long, I would have expected some action much sooner.The film suggests this isn't Jack's first rodeo (apropos because he does ride bulls).  Although the lines between classifications blur, Jack (Jake Gyllenhaal) seems to be easy to identify as a bi-sexual.  He has relationships (and just sex) with other men during the film, but as with Ennis, he also goes on to marry, have children and enjoy sex with women enough to cheat on his wife with other females.The enigmatic Ennis (Heath Ledger) shatters labels.  He seems to be a straight male who also likes to have sex with Jack...just Jack.  He is uninterested in other men, and viewers may assume he would never have stumbled into another homosexual relationship had Jack not sought him out.  Is it just that he loves Jack?  Maybe.  But he also seems almost content without him.This love/hate relationship Ennis has for Jack will lead some to view Jack as an instigator, and he clearly isn't as sympathetic as Ennis (Gene Shalit recently described him as a sexual predator, which isn't a baseless accusation).  Ennis is hard to understand completely, everything he does contradicts something else.  He's obviously torn and seems to allow that indecisiveness to contribute to more pain for himself and others.Clearly, the film sees the tragedy in homophobia.  These two men love each other, but they are unable to be together, to spend their lives as happy as those nights on Brokeback Mountain.  But the film also shows how the pain is not exclusive to the men.  Families are ruined, and women are left believing they are somehow inadequate.  This idea seems to be as much a swipe against gays who try to live as straight males as against homophobia.I found the middle part of the film to be a bit long.  Doom was obviously approaching, and it took a little too long to arrive.  One less summer on Brokeback Mountain and one less jilted female could have made for a more thrifty and enjoyable narrative.MILD SPOILERS AHEAD:The ending was surprisingly touching for me.  It ends with the two destined to never see each other again.  In a search for truth and closure, one of the men seeks out the family of the other and hears how his lover used to speak of the love they shared.  Hearing those romanticized visions of what could have been juxtaposes against the reality of their world, one that would never accept the men for who they were.  A Romeo and Juilet for the 21st Century?  Maybe.I liked this film more than I expected, but what I won't like will be the beast it will become.  In the next few months, as it breaks the bank at the box office and wins everything from the Oscars to the MTV Awards, the film will become the bible of the gay rights movement.  Those of us who don't follow their platform will be paralleled to the Randy Quaid character, evil in all ways, including his homophobia.  Those like Shalit who see problems with the film will be shouted down, as dissent will not be tolerated.  You can either love this film or you can be classified as a bigoted homophobe.  That idea frightens me.",4,"A western where ""the good guys get it in the end""",1136764800,"01 9, 2006",2006,4577,"['town', 'could', 'not', 'be', 'smaller', 'sky', 'could', 'not', 'be', 'greater', 'Ennis', 'Jack', 'find', 'other', 'work', 'cattle', 'hands', 'make', 'way', 'same', 'rancher', 'office', 'get', 'assigned', 'Brokeback', 'Mountain', 'wrangling', 'herd', 'sheep', 'so', 'large', 'stretch', 'Texas', 'Canada', 'many', 'weeks', 'only', 'other', 'companionship', 'one', 'night', 'heavy', 'drinking', 'two', 'suddenly', 'violently', 'have', 'sex.I', 'assume', 'viewers', 'know', 'coming', 'as', 'much', 'knew', 'Jesus', 'was', 'doomed', 'Mel', 'Gibson', 'picture', 'Brokeback', 'Mountain', 'already', 'become', 'cultural', 'phenomenon', 'gay', 'cowboy', 'film', 'everyone', 'two', 'will', 'eventually', 'play', 'hide', 'lasso', 'Two', 'things', 'introduction', 'surprised', 'First', 'did', 'not', 'expect', 'shepherding', 'be', 'presently', 'so', 'beautifully', 'two', 'men', 'endless', 'herd', 'sheep', 'relationship', 'Gus', 'Call', 'Lonesome', 'Dove', 'story', 'penned', 'Larry', 'McMurtry', 'drive', 'cattle', 'Montana', 'vistas', 'screen', 'world', 'infinite', 'space', 'glory', 'two', 'little', 'cowboys', 'only', 'specs', 'hidden', 'evergreens', 'icy', 'ponds.The', 'second', 'surprise', 'was', 'lack', 'tenderness', 'relationship', 'had', 'sex', 'Someone', 'not', 'expecting', 'become', 'lovers', 'will', 'be', 'shocked', 'nothing', 'have', 'feelings', 'just', 'wake', 'up', 'middle', 'night', 'go', 'Maybe', 'heterosexual', 'opinion', 'one', 'boys', 'had', 'been', 'camped', 'out', 'Natalie', 'Portman', 'long', 'would', 'have', 'expected', 'action', 'much', 'sooner.The', 'film', ""n't"", 'Jack', 'first', 'rodeo', 'apropos', 'ride', 'bulls', 'lines', 'classifications', 'blur', 'Jack', 'Jake', 'Gyllenhaal', 'be', 'easy', 'identify', 'bi-sexual', 'relationships', 'just', 'sex', 'other', 'men', 'film', 'Ennis', 'also', 'marry', 'have', 'children', 'enjoy', 'sex', 'women', 'enough', 'cheat', 'wife', 'other', 'females.The', 'enigmatic', 'Ennis', 'Heath', 'Ledger', 'shatters', 'labels', 'be', 'straight', 'male', 'who', 'also', 'likes', 'have', 'sex', 'Jack', 'just', 'Jack', 'uninterested', 'other', 'men', 'viewers', 'may', 'assume', 'would', 'never', 'have', 'stumbled', 'homosexual', 'relationship', 'had', 'Jack', 'not', 'sought', 'out', 'just', 'Jack', 'Maybe', 'also', 'almost', 'content', 'him.This', 'love/hate', 'relationship', 'Ennis', 'Jack', 'will', 'lead', 'view', 'Jack', 'instigator', 'clearly', ""n't"", 'as', 'sympathetic', 'Ennis', 'Gene', 'Shalit', 'recently', 'described', 'sexual', 'predator', ""n't"", 'baseless', 'accusation', 'Ennis', 'hard', 'understand', 'completely', 'everything', 'contradicts', 'something', 'else', 'obviously', 'torn', 'allow', 'indecisiveness', 'contribute', 'more', 'pain', 'others.Clearly', 'film', 'tragedy', 'homophobia', 'two', 'men', 'love', 'other', 'are', 'unable', 'be', 'together', 'spend', 'lives', 'as', 'happy', 'nights', 'Brokeback', 'Mountain', 'film', 'also', 'how', 'pain', 'not', 'exclusive', 'men', 'Families', 'are', 'ruined', 'women', 'are', 'left', 'believing', 'are', 'somehow', 'inadequate', 'idea', 'be', 'as', 'much', 'swipe', 'gays', 'who', 'try', 'live', 'straight', 'males', 'homophobia.I', 'found', 'middle', 'part', 'film', 'be', 'bit', 'long', 'Doom', 'was', 'obviously', 'approaching', 'took', 'little', 'too', 'long', 'arrive', 'One', 'less', 'summer', 'Brokeback', 'Mountain', 'one', 'less', 'jilted', 'female', 'could', 'have', 'made', 'more', 'thrifty', 'enjoyable', 'narrative.MILD', 'SPOILERS', 'AHEAD', 'ending', 'was', 'surprisingly', 'touching', 'two', 'destined', 'never', 'see', 'other', 'again', 'search', 'truth', 'closure', 'one', 'men', 'out', 'family', 'other', 'how', 'lover', 'used', 'speak', 'love', 'shared', 'Hearing', 'romanticized', 'visions', 'what', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'juxtaposes', 'reality', 'world', 'one', 'would', 'never', 'accept', 'men', 'who', 'were', 'Romeo', 'Juilet', '21st', 'Century', 'Maybe.I', 'liked', 'film', 'more', 'expected', 'what', 'wo', ""n't"", 'like', 'will', 'be', 'beast', 'will', 'become', 'next', 'few', 'months', 'bank', 'box', 'office', 'wins', 'everything', 'Oscars', 'MTV', 'Awards', 'film', 'will', 'become', 'bible', 'gay', 'rights', 'movement', 'who', 'do', ""n't"", 'follow', 'platform', 'will', 'be', 'paralleled', 'Randy', 'Quaid', 'character', 'evil', 'ways', 'including', 'homophobia', 'Shalit', 'who', 'see', 'problems', 'film', 'will', 'be', 'shouted', 'down', 'dissent', 'will', 'not', 'be', 'tolerated', 'can', 'either', 'love', 'film', 'can', 'be', 'classified', 'bigoted', 'homophobe', 'idea']",N/A
172860,A4UKBG3M5U5TI,1417030321,Westley,"[23, 28]","""Brokeback Mountain"" opened in a few large cities and has slowly rolled out into the rest of the country.  Along the way, it's picked up nominations from nearly every critics group and for every award possible.  Thus, when some people across the country finally have the opportunity to view ""Brokeback Mountain,"" it will have been built up incredibly.  I'm sure many people are very eager to see the ""gay cowboy"" movie that's winning so many awards.  Unfortunately, I think some people may be disappointed.  ""Brokeback Mountain"" is ultimately a small film, even if it does break some barriers.  There have been hundreds of successful gay films, but somehow this one, largely because it twists the western mythos of macho straight cowboys, has already attained almost mythical stature.  But please remember that it's a small, leisurely-paced movie.Heath Ledger and Jake Gyllenhaal play the cowboys, Ennis Del Mar and Jack Twist.  In 1963, they're hired by a rancher to watch a flock of sheep on a forlorn mountaintop. Indeed, both have lead pretty desolate lives - Ennis was orphaned early, and Jack's father was a cruel jerk, as we witness later.  Being a cowboy was obviously a hard life and the best they can hope for is to get some steady ranch work.  Long days together lead to the inevitable small talk and whiskey drinking as well as something else unforeseen - sex.However, whatever surprise the two men feel about having sex together seems dwarfed by the shock that they've found something in each other that they've never found anyplace else.  Different viewers may disagree about what Ennis and Jack see in each other; some may see the acceptance between the men or the end to their loneliness that they find together.  Whatever it is, they never find it again.  After the leave the mountain, they separate - Ennis marries quickly and Jack eventually follows suit.  Four years passes before they see each other again; unexpectedly to them, their feelings for each other are completely undiminished.  So begins a 20 plus year relationship marked with yearning that will never be satisfied.To some audiences, this film will just be a gay love story.  However, I think it's much closer in tone to one of Ang Lee's prior films, ""Sense and Sensibility.""  Jane Austen specialized in love stories where characters' longing to be together is often outweighed by the price of being together.  At one point, Jack offers to spend his life with Ennis, but Ennis, always the more pragmatic of the two, knows that two men living together in 1960s Wyoming would be nearly impossible.In all aspects, ""Brokeback Mountain"" is finely wrought.  Ang Lee's direction is up to his usual high standard, and the cinematography is breath-taking.  The script is from Pulitizer winner Annie Proulx's fine short story and was adapted by another Pulitzer winner, Larry McMurtry.  In many ways, the film's simple portrait of the West is similar to McMurty's work in classics such as ""Hud"" and ""The Last Picture Show.""  The supporting cast is uniformly good, including Jake Gyllenhaal, Michelle Williams, and Anne Hathaway.  However, the revelation is truly Heath Ledger.  Aside from his work as the son of a racist in 2001's ""Monster Ball,"" he hasn't shown much acting promise.  Nevertheless, he perfectly captures Ennis.  He's likely to be nominated for an Oscar and perhaps even challenge Philip Seymour Hoffman ""(""Capote"") for the win.  Indeed, it's likely that ""Brokeback Mountain"" will win more than a few Oscars this year, and it's most worthy of the attention.",5,"Crouching Cowboy, Hidden Love",1136505600,"01 6, 2006",2006,3546,"['Brokeback', 'Mountain', 'opened', 'few', 'large', 'cities', 'slowly', 'rolled', 'out', 'rest', 'country', 'way', 'picked', 'up', 'nominations', 'nearly', 'critics', 'group', 'award', 'possible', 'Thus', 'when', 'people', 'country', 'finally', 'have', 'opportunity', 'view', 'Brokeback', 'Mountain', 'will', 'have', 'been', 'built', 'up', 'incredibly', ""'m"", 'sure', 'many', 'people', 'are', 'very', 'eager', 'see', 'gay', 'cowboy', 'movie', 'winning', 'so', 'many', 'awards', 'Unfortunately', 'think', 'people', 'may', 'be', 'disappointed', 'Brokeback', 'Mountain', 'ultimately', 'small', 'film', 'even', 'break', 'barriers', 'have', 'been', 'hundreds', 'successful', 'gay', 'films', 'somehow', 'one', 'largely', 'western', 'mythos', 'macho', 'straight', 'cowboys', 'already', 'attained', 'almost', 'mythical', 'stature', 'please', 'remember', 'small', 'leisurely-paced', 'movie.Heath', 'Ledger', 'Jake', 'Gyllenhaal', 'play', 'cowboys', 'Ennis', 'Del', 'Mar', 'Jack', 'Twist', '1963', ""'re"", 'hired', 'rancher', 'watch', 'flock', 'sheep', 'forlorn', 'mountaintop', 'Indeed', 'have', 'lead', 'pretty', 'desolate', 'lives', 'Ennis', 'was', 'orphaned', 'early', 'Jack', 'father', 'was', 'cruel', 'jerk', 'witness', 'later', 'Being', 'cowboy', 'was', 'obviously', 'hard', 'life', 'best', 'can', 'hope', 'get', 'steady', 'ranch', 'work', 'Long', 'days', 'together', 'lead', 'inevitable', 'small', 'talk', 'whiskey', 'drinking', 'as', 'well', 'something', 'else', 'unforeseen', 'sex.However', 'surprise', 'two', 'men', 'feel', 'having', 'sex', 'together', 'dwarfed', 'shock', ""'ve"", 'found', 'something', 'other', ""'ve"", 'never', 'found', 'anyplace', 'else', 'Different', 'viewers', 'may', 'disagree', 'what', 'Ennis', 'Jack', 'see', 'other', 'may', 'see', 'acceptance', 'men', 'end', 'loneliness', 'find', 'together', 'Whatever', 'never', 'find', 'again', 'leave', 'mountain', 'separate', 'Ennis', 'marries', 'quickly', 'Jack', 'eventually', 'suit', 'Four', 'years', 'see', 'other', 'again', 'unexpectedly', 'feelings', 'other', 'are', 'completely', 'undiminished', 'So', '20', 'year', 'relationship', 'marked', 'yearning', 'will', 'never', 'be', 'satisfied.To', 'audiences', 'film', 'will', 'just', 'be', 'gay', 'love', 'story', 'However', 'think', 'much', 'closer', 'tone', 'one', 'Ang', 'Lee', 'prior', 'films', 'Sense', 'Sensibility', 'Jane', 'Austen', 'specialized', 'love', 'stories', 'where', 'characters', 'longing', 'be', 'together', 'often', 'outweighed', 'price', 'being', 'together', 'one', 'point', 'Jack', 'spend', 'life', 'Ennis', 'Ennis', 'always', 'more', 'pragmatic', 'two', 'two', 'men', 'living', 'together', '1960s', 'Wyoming', 'would', 'be', 'nearly', 'impossible.In', 'aspects', 'Brokeback', 'Mountain', 'finely', 'wrought', 'Ang', 'Lee', 'direction', 'up', 'usual', 'high', 'standard', 'cinematography', 'breath-taking', 'script', 'Pulitizer', 'winner', 'Annie', 'Proulx', 'fine', 'short', 'story', 'was', 'adapted', 'Pulitzer', 'winner', 'Larry', 'McMurtry', 'many', 'ways', 'film', 'simple', 'portrait', 'West', 'similar', 'McMurty', 'work', 'classics', 'such', 'Hud', 'Last', 'Picture', 'Show', 'supporting', 'cast', 'uniformly', 'good', 'including', 'Jake', 'Gyllenhaal', 'Michelle', 'Williams', 'Anne', 'Hathaway', 'However', 'revelation', 'truly', 'Heath', 'Ledger', 'Aside', 'work', 'son', 'racist', '2001', 'Monster', 'Ball', ""n't"", 'shown', 'much', 'acting', 'promise', 'Nevertheless', 'perfectly', 'Ennis', 'likely', 'be', 'nominated', 'Oscar', 'perhaps', 'even', 'challenge', 'Philip', 'Seymour', 'Hoffman', 'Capote', 'win', 'Indeed', 'likely', 'Brokeback', 'Mountain', 'will', 'win', 'more', 'few', 'Oscars', 'year', 'most', 'worthy', 'attention']",N/A

172864,A1IFHFXIHESV28,1417030321,"William M. Feagin ""music dealer/geek""","[14, 19]","Brokeback Mountain is the story of two cowboys, Ennis Delmar and Jack Twist, hired in the summer of 1963 to tend to a herd of sheep in the mountains of Wyoming.  Ennis is unfailingly, unflinchingly played by Heath Ledger--and if he doesn't take the Oscar for Best Actor, I will truly be shocked--a character who could easily have stepped whole and breathing off the pages of a good Western novel (think Louis L'Amour, Zane Grey, Edward Abbey or even Michael Gear), every inch the stoic man of few words.  Jack (the excellent Jake Gyllenhaal--check him out in October Skies and The Day After Tomorrow, among other films) is a more voluble character, frisky and chatty, but also deeply sympathetic...and fated, as you will see if you watch the film.There is a great deal of tension between them from the film's beginning, when we first meet Ennis and Jack as they wait by the boss-man's trailer to find out the low-down on the job.  Jack watches Ennis discretely; Ennis remains impassive, appearing to take no notice of Jack at all.  They are sent up to Brokeback Mountain, and all seems normal until one night, when Ennis decides to sleep outside the tent (which they don't often share, as one usually remains with the sheep while the other minds their camp).  Jack sees that Ennis is freezing and commands him to come inside the tent--after mere minutes of body heat, the chemistry explodes into violent lovemaking (by which I mean intense, explosive, urgent).Despite this, the two remain in denial about their relationship (""God knows we ain't queers,"" says Ennis), yet it clearly affects them both deeply, Ennis with perhaps greater turmoil--as they part ways at the end of that first summer, he dashes into an alley between two buildings in the Wyoming hamlet below the mountain and is violently sick.  After Ennis' marriage to Alma, his fiancee, this denied tendency shows up briefly in their marriage (there is a sex scene in which Ennis flips Alma over on her stomach and takes her from behind, despite her choked protests), and Alma surreptitiously discovers the truth of her husband's relationship with Jack when they are reunited in 1967, having not seen each other for four years, and tearfully ponders how she's going to handle this awful knowledge.Over the years, the two men get together infrequently--Jack always going to Ennis, never the other way round--and both wind up getting divorces from their respective spouses.  The tension of their relationship shows up in all manner of ways (when Ennis fights a man in the street after a nasty argument with Alma, or Jack's disagreement with his father-in-law over whether his son should be allowed to watch football during Thanksgiving dinner--Jack wins that one); Ennis is frightened and conflicted by their relationship, while Jack's heart clearly aches and yearns for Ennis.  That this is never resolved makes the ending all the more poignant and painful.It helps to remember that, in 1963 when the film begins, homosexuality was still considered a mental illness (not taken off the books until 1973, four years after the Gay Rights Movement began in earnest), so Ennis' fears are well-grounded.  But the heart wants what it wants, and sometimes getting it requires the ultimate sacrifice.  This film gives us that lesson in painful yet memorable detail; all the performances are excellent, even Randy Quaid's turn as Jack and Ennis' boss at Brokeback...truly a man of his time.  Run--don't walk--to the nearest cinema where this is playing, and see Brokeback Mountain.

You'd expect its ""Brokeback Mountain"" review to be titled something like ""Hollywood Liberals Aggressively Promote Homosexual Agenda"". But, no -- it's ""Rape of the Marlboro Man"". (Yes!) The review argues that homosexuals are trying to appropriate the upright, decent, manly image of the cowboy to encourage acceptance of their own debased/depraved/perverted views of manhood.One doesn't have to know much Western history to recognize that the traditional view of the cowboy as ""the man on the white horse"" doesn't bear close examination. Cowboys were rough-living men who drank, gambled, and whored with little restraint.Cowboys and other Westerners were often solitary men - that's always been part of their mystique. (See ""The Myth of the American Superhero"" by Lawrence & Jewett.) Many left the East to get away from society, from government, from social pressures (including those to marry). From ""The Last of the Mohicans"" to ""Lonesome Dove"", frontiersmen have been laconic loners. (Well... Gus McCrae isn't exactly laconic. But Woodrow F Call makes up for it.)Cowboys and other western pioneers lived in an overwhelmingly homosocial environment. Whores provided a convenient sexual outlet, whereas marriage brought with it social fetters. Men therefore looked to other men for companionship -- and sometimes other things.The emotionally intimate relationships of Western males has been written about for a century and a half. Mark Twain observed homosexual behavior among prospectors. Charles Badger Clark's ""The Lost Pardner"", one of the all-time most-popular cowboy poems, outlines the near-sexual -- and explicitly misogynistic * -- relationship of two wranglers. Yet heterosexual males read it without embarrassment -- or seeming awareness of the poem's implications -- because the truth it speaks about intense male friendships likely masks its truth about male sexuality. Clark's ""Bachin'"" extols the delights of a female-free life (""...in our trouble list we never count a wife""). Its opening line -- ""Our ways are hid; our trails are strange"" -- and the later ""Each has a reason why he's lone, but keeps it 'neath his hat"" ares suggestive. Clark's less-familiar poem ""My Enemy"" ends with the adversaries not only making up, but also apparently making out. The implication is subtle, but Clark's writing shows such a consistently careful choice of words that it's difficult to read the meaning of ""and when dark found us limp and jaded"" otherwise.Several Bret Harte stories express a startling homoeroticism. The men of ""Tennessee's Partner"" and ""In the Tules"" share a love for each other that's ""consummated"" only in the afterlife. The implied ""marriage"" of Tennessee and his male partner did not prevent this story from becoming one of Harte's most-popular, probably because it was written toward the end of an era when it was not uncommon for men to express effusive love for each other, and the Romantic fancy of lovers uniting in death had not yet faded. ""Tennessee's Partner"" is a fine example of hiding something in plain sight.If ""Brokeback Mountain"" deviates from our view of the West, that view is the view presented by Hollywood and TV -- not the view of the people who actually lived and worked in the West. You cannot truly ""rape"" (in any sense of the word) someone or something that never existed.The inconvenient truths are... Men like sex. When women aren't around (and sometimes when they are), they'll have it with each other. And -- yes -- even unerringly masculine men will engage in mutual sodomy (as Jack and Ennis do), however unbelievable that might seem to heterosexual males reading this. (I speak from direct experience.) ""Brokeback Mountain"" is a gut punch to the American view of what constitutes ""masculinity"", which is why it attracted the outrage of groups and people that might otherwise ignore films with homosexual characters or themes.Those who'd like to investigate this subject in greater depth should read ""Queer Cowboys"" by Chris Packard and ""Male-Male Intimacy in Early America"" by William Benemann.Larry McMurtry has famously said ""the story was just sitting there, waiting to be told"". (For a writer notorious for demythologizing the West, why hadn't _he_ told it? **) Yet it /has/ been told, many times. ""Brokeback Mountain"" doesn't stand in isolation, but is firmly in the tradition of stories about frontiersmen sharing marriage-like relationships with indigenous males or other frontiersmen. *** ""Brokeback Mountain"" is simply the first time a serious writer has told that story without ignoring or ""coding"" its sexual elements. ****Larry McMurtry bragged about using virtually all the dialog from the short story. This is not true. Some significant material was removed, such as Ennis telling Jack of the overwhelming sexual attraction he feels for him, and Jack's telling Ennis why he finds sodomy with him so pleasurable. (I asked a bisexual horseman whether Jack's understanding of the physiology involved was correct, and he said it was.)McMurtry's novels don't shy away from sex, but he isn't interested in graphic depictions, and ""Brokeback Mountain""'s film treatment reflects this. As late as a year before filming began, the screenplay had the camera coyly averting its eye as Ennis mounted Jack.But McMurtry doesn't limit himself to avoiding graphic sex -- he tries to de-sexualize the story. Though Annie Proulx describes Jack and Ennis as engaging in hot, sweaty sex up on Brokeback, the film shows them only briefly rolling around -- and that through Aguirre's binoculars. More significantly, the screenplay omits an important moment in their final tryst -- Jack putting his hand between Ennis's thighs to warm it, while Ennis unbuttons Jack's shirt.These omissions support the only valid criticism of the film -- it's overly reserved. Its basic reserve is a good thing -- the story easily lends itself to overwrought melodrama. Had the direction or acting been not so restrained, the effect would have been ludicrous, and ""Brokeback Mountain"" would have died a quick and unlamented death.But the restraint is excessive. The film fails to fully show what the short story makes clear -- 20 years haven't dimmed Ennis and Jack's crude lust for each other. We need to see them, on that final camping trip, pulling each other's clothes off and wrestling in front of the fire, kissing each other as violently as they had in front of Ennis's apartment. This scene would make their final argument and Ennis's ultimate acknowledgement of their mutual love all the more poignant and pathetic (in the good sense).As fine as Ang Lee's direction is (it's equivalent to walking on snow without leaving footprints), Peter Bogdanovich might have been a bit less ""arty"" and might have better caught the intensity of Ennis and Jack's relationship, without stepping over the line into melodrama. (Think of the pool-table scene in ""The Last Picture Show"".) And in the fantasy world of ""if only"", imagine the same script and actors directed by Alfred Hitchcock, with a Bernard Herrmann score. (Before you protest, note that ""Brokeback Mountain"" is, thematically, very much a Hitchcock story.)The religious right would like people to believe movie reviewers are a liberal lot consciously promoting ""the homosexual agenda"", and that ""Brokeback Mountain"" provided the perfect opportunity. Rubbish. Reviewers -- even those as intellectually shallow and confused as Michael Medved -- recognized a great film when they saw it. ""Brokeback Mountain"" speaks a truth many people want to suppress -- men become emotionally involved with each other, and have sex with each other, just as men and women do.Indeed -- and I emphasize this point to any uncomfortable hetereo males who've read this far -- men can and do have intense emotional relationships with each other /without/ sexual desire. I've had such relationships with hetero men, and know there are many straight guys out there who want emotional -- though not sexual -- intimacy with other men. Unfortunately, they often have to go to queer men for it, because most hetero men are just too cowardly.But is ""Brokeback Mountain"" _truly_ a great film? Well, it's an /iconic film -- as iconic as 2001, The Adventures of Robin Hood, Casablanca, Chinatown, Citizen Kane, King Kong, Network (another Best Picture loser), The Maltese Falcon, Snow White, or The Wizard of Oz. Great films aren't necessarily iconic -- but an iconic film is, by definition, great. *****""Brokeback Mountain"" has also entered pop culture, perhaps indelibly, even among people who haven't seen the film. When a female reporter used ""Brokeback"" references in a piece about Vladimir Putin's bare-chested fishing expedition, few there were who didn't get the joke. And ""I wish I knew how to quit you"" is likely to become a lasting catch phrase, just as ""Frankly my dear, I don't give a damn"" and ""I'm shocked... shocked!"" have.So why did ""Brokeback Mountain"" lose Best Picture? If Tony Curtis and Ernest Borgnine hadn't opened their stupid traps, the answer might have remained equivocal. But it seems that ""Crash"" -- a film with mixed reviews that appeared on few best-picture lists -- was nominated to provide an alternative for those who had personal (rather than artistic) reasons for rejecting ""Brokeback Mountain"".Tony Curtis (nee, Bernard Schwartz) -- who has unapologetically admitted to having sex with men (see the Wikipedia bio) -- should have _some_ feeling for what it means to belong to a discriminated-against minority. Both he and Mr. Borgnine have worked with gay men and women (on both sides of the camera), and ought to have the common sense to realize that attacking ""Brokeback Mountain"" -- on other than artistic grounds -- was a slap in the face to their queer colleagues. ****** Despite Mr. Borgnine's averral that John Wayne would not have tolerated ""Brokeback Mountain"", I suspect ""The Duke"" -- assuming the film truly did offend him -- would simply have kept his mouth shut (at least in public).An anti-parallel could be drawn with the 1947 Best-Picture winner, ""Gentleman's Agreement"", an intelligent film about anti-Semitism, though hardly of the quality justifying a Best-Picture nomination, let alone a win. But Hollywood's demographic is strongly Jewish, so it's not surprising it was nominated and won, simply because it corresponded with the interests of that demographic. ******* Imagine the reaction if a gentile actor had said he'd no intention of seeing the film because of its subject matter!""Hollywood"" had the opportunity to award ""Best Picture"" to a film that truly deserved the honor, if only because it disrupted the usual order of things, and did it so well. As a resepcted LA reviewer remarked the day following the ceremony, Hollywood had finally demonstrated (if any proof were needed) that the Academy Awards were meaningless.Is the Story Plausible?-----------------------It's significant that no one -- not even the most rabidly anti-gay fundamentalists -- has raised any objection to ""Brokeback Mountain""'s plausibility. Of course, fundamentalists /wouldn't/ object, as it would contradict their assertion that homosexual behavior is a consciously chosen perversion. The seeming naturalness of Ennis and Jack's attraction is arguably the most-disturbing thing about the story.Ennis and Jack's tale is completely plausible. People who think ""real men"" don't have sex with each other -- or God forbid -- kiss each other, or fall in love, don't know much about what goes on in the world. I've known queer men who would beat John Wayne in a butch-off and could cold-cock The Duke in a fair fight.An appreciation for the male physique -- which is only one step removed from sexual attraction -- is hardly uncommon among heterosexual males. (Heterosexual men engage in bodybuilding primarily to improve their looks, not their health.) I saw it in my 100%-hetero father's reaction to Douglas Fairbanks' (lack of) costume in ""The Thief of Bagdhad"". And highly sexed hetero males sometimes experiment with homosexual behavior. (I was publicly out in college, and two notoriously womanizing male acquaintances came on to me simply because they were curious.)Men are sometimes confused about their sexual orientation. I've met hetero men who told me they were afraid of waking up one morning and discovering they were queer. They likely had sexual feelings for other men they didn't understand or know how to handle.Ennis and Jack's mutual attraction is a normal thing, and doesn't need an explanation, any more than Rhett and Scarlett's does. And Scarlett's interest in Rhett is unabashedly sexual, but no one sees much wrong in that. (""He was a tall man and powerfully built. Scarlett thought she had never seen a man with such wide shoulders, so heavy with muscles, almost too heavy for gentility. ...his eyes were as bold and black as any pirate's appraising a galleon to be scuttled or a maiden to be ravished."") Which should be no surprise to anybody.Watching the film for a fifth or sixth time, on Blu-ray, I remain impressed with Michelle Williams's heartbreaking performance (particularly the short scene where Ennis cruelly dismisses their marriage, and she tells him what she's finally figured out), and the scene in which Jack's mother asks Ennis to come back. She wants to spend time with someone who truly loved her son -- which her appallingly nasty husband never did.Comments on the Music---------------------I was surprised at ""Brokeback Mountain"" winning Best Score, as there is so _little_ score. Yet, it is the _lack_ of scoring that contributes so much to ""Brokeback Mountain""'s dramatic punch -- it would be nowhere as good a film if it had a full score. It's probably the first film score to win an Oscar because of its non-existence.Bernard Herrmann famously said that the purpose of music is to establish an emotional connection between what's going on up on the screen and the audience -- the composer had to fill in what  the director could not or would not show. Herrmann was a master of film music because he focused on what was /not/ being said or shown. An outstanding example occurs in ""The Man in the Gray Flannel Suit"" during the flashback of Gregory Peck killing a German soldier. In just a few bars of music, Herrmann conveys everything Peck is thinking and feeling.But most composers score much less imaginatively than Herrmann, merely underlining what we're seeing or hearing, rather than enhancing or complementing it. Too often the music /tells/ the audience how to react to the scene. That creates a distancing effect, where the emotion is conveyed more by the music than by the acting.In ""Brokeback Mountain"", the music is almost all atmosphere. There are no Leitmotivs (other than the melancholic guitar theme, which sometimes arrives to represent Ennis and Jack's relationship), and the music rarely underlines either thoughts or events. Consider Ennis and Jack's reunion, their ecstatic embrace, and Alma's appalled reaction to seeing her husband kissing another man with more passion than he's ever shown /her/. Though this scene seemingly cries out for music, there is none! We get the direct emotions of the situation, uncolored and unfiltered.This was likely intentional. Annie Proulx says she's not a ""sentimental"" writer; I suspect Ennis and Jack's relationship (which, let's be honest, is -- even at that point in the story -- far more sexual than romantic) would seem more than a little silly if it were ""enhanced"" by music.On the rare occasions when the music does reflect the scene's affect, Santaolalla's scoring is spare, subtle, and unclich&eacute;d. This is a remarkable score that shows, in an era where 70% or more of most films' running time is scored, how less can be more.Comments on DVD Quality-----------------------Projection quality in American theaters is generally mediocre or worse -- inadequate brightness, muddy/smeary/dirty prints, flat color, lack of overall sharpness, etc.DVDs and LVs tend to automatically ""look better"" than what we see in the theater, simply because removing the projection lens and screen improves sharpness/detail and increases contrast. Transfers from the negative (rather than an IP or projection print) effect further improvements in sharpness, detail, color accuracy, and saturation.But these improvements aren't always aesthetically desirable. The cinematographer normally lights the film knowing how what's front of the camera will ""translate"" to the final projection print. The biggest change is a loss of shadow detail, which can be used to advantage (eg, the substitution of a piece of cardboard for Robby's left leg in the final scene of ""Forbidden Planet""). When the DVD transfer restores the ""lost"" detail, we see things we weren't supposed to.For ""Brokeback Mountain"", these improvements work against the film. The generally dark, dingy quality of many scenes, that so fits the film's tone, is lightened, or lost altogether. Colors are now sometimes too bright and saturated, particularly in scenes where they shouldn't be. There's far too much shadow detail -- Aguirre's trailer office now looks relatively clean and neat, and Jack's family home not quite so dirty or run-down.Though there's now a ""deluxe"" multi-DVD edition, its transfer appears to be no different from the original single disk's. I hope someday the director and cinematographer - working from the negative -- will time each scene for the appropriate density, shadow detail, color saturation, etc. We need to see ""Brokeback Mountain"" as it was (probably) intended. The current DVD does not, as far as I can determine, present it properly.That's the DVD, of course. See the following remarks on the Blu-ray.Comments on Blu-ray Quality---------------------------I've remarked in other reviews that the /only/ way to see a movie is /at home/, from an HD source on a big display (50"" or larger). This couldn't be more true of ""Brokeback Mountain"".I saw the film twice theatrically, at different theaters. Particularly with the indoor scenes, the projection print was a muddy mess, though I felt at the time it was appropriate to the film's atmosphere. The DVD struck me (and a few other people) as overly clean-looking.The Blu-ray changes all that. We are now seeing (in effect) the camera negative, in high resolution. The most-significant improvement is not in sharpness and detail (though there are huge gains), but in tonality. The BD images truly capture what it's like to stand outside on an overcast day, or the feeling one has in someone's living room or kitchen. Annie Proulx says she writes stories about peoples' relationships with their environments (both physical and social), and the Blu-ray transfer captures Ennis and Jack's environments very well.Though dramas do not generally benefit much from high definition, this one is an exception.* Clark almost always represents relationships with women as encumbrances, or just plain unnecessary.** Though Gus and Woodrow are portrayed as close friends of many years' standing, their personalities -- the ever-randy, ever-whoring Gus, and the emotionally constipated ur-loner Woodrow -- seem consciously calculated to block the remotest possibility of anything sexual between them, even something as unthreatening to the sense of one's masculinity as ""a chaw fer a chaw"". After reading ""Dead Man's Walk"" and ""Comanche Moon"", you conclude that two such utterly different people couldn't possibly have been the lifelong friends they're portrayed as in ""Lonesome Dove"".*** While we're at it, let's throw in ""The Epic of Gilgmamesh"". The Gilgmamesh / Enkidu relationship is intensely homoerotic and vehemently misogynistic. Their society did not proscribe sexual relations between men; the Mitchell realization gives alternate versions that indicate they engaged in mutual sodomy.**** Richard Amory's classic ""Loon"" novels, though well-written, don't count. Though giving the illusion of reality -- Amory appears to have known far more about the realities of living in the wild than J. F. Cooper ever did -- they're fantasies set in an all-male world.***** An iconic short story became an iconic film. The current consensus is that ""Brokeback Mountain"" is not only the best short story ""The New Yorker"" has yet published, but one of the greatest American short stories, period. Without intending to, Annie Proulx hit the nail on the head. It's the work she will most-likely be remembered for.****** In ""If Chins Could Kill"", Bruce Campbell offers high praise for Ernest Borgnine's professionalism. But his professionalism apparently doesn't extend to having the sense not to defecate in your own nest.******* The 1947 Academy Award nominations were filled with ironies. ""Crossfire"" was also about anti-Semitism -- a soldier is murdered simply because he's Jewish -- but the film is based on the novel ""The Brick Foxhole"", in which the victim is homosexual. And the author of ""Gentleman's Agreement"", Laura Z. Hobson, would later pen ""Consenting Adult"", a novel about her gay son's coming out.",5,Inconvenient truths...

172866,A1SPB225CVTRUU,1417030321,"Wing Lee ""filmfan""","[17, 20]","First of all, I am so relieved that I have finally seen this film after so much anticipation, and I was moved to tears as I had expected. It's been so long since I have been so taken by a romantic movie, and Brokeback Mountain is as beautiful and emotionally impacting as films like Happy Together(Tony Leung), Intimates(Carina Lau), and The English Patient(Ralph Fiennes). It's such a treat to see Jake Gyllenhaal and Heath Ledger under the meticulous direction of Ang Lee. I agree with Lee that this film is a beautiful love story and not a gay cowboy movie.Brokeback Mountain uses the beautiful mountain landscape of Alberta as a stand in for the Wyoming mountains. It's the place where Jack(Gyllenhaal) and Ennis(Ledger) spent their first year in the mid '60s working together as cowboys tending the sheeps. The two lonesome cowboys clashed at first, but eventual became friends and secret lovers. Jack is the sexy and rebellious one, and Ennis is emotionally and sexually confused. At first, they didn't want to acknowledge their feelings for each other, until they were separated for four years, and started to miss each other. During those four years, they both got married and led a ""normal life"", and had kids. Ennis' wife Alma(Michelle Williams) eventually found out that he's cheating on her with Jack, but never actually confronted him until years later. Jack had been relocated to Texas since marrying the beautiful and wealthy Laureen(Anne Hathway).When Jack and Ennis were reunited, it reignited their old passion and lust for each other, and occasionally went up to Brokeback Mountain to have their secret romantic getaways while pretending to be on fishing trips. Jack's feeling for Ennis grew stronger gradually, and suggested to move away and live together. But Ennis has homophobia of his own and fear any possible alienation and condemnation, and just wanted to keep it a ""once in a blue moon"" deal. So time passes by, and twenty years later, they are both middle aged men, still going through the same old pattern. Jack becomes resentful towards Ennis, because he had wasted half of his life loving him and not having him entirely, even when he had already been divorced from Alma for years.This film features a scene stealing Michelle Williams. The scene when Alma saw Ennis kissing and hugging Jack outside her house was so funny and shocking. She was mesmerizing when she had her heart-to-heart confrontation with Ennis. Anne Hathway has less screentime and a less challenging role to work with, and she gets to wear different kinds of wigs. Her final scene when she breaks the tragic news to Ennis was her big moment. I enjoyed watching every scene between Jake and Heath. I actually like Jake's character more, because he knew what he wanted and was not afraid to love the man of his life. I was very moved by his final scene, which was kind of long, but the most dramatic between the two leads. I wished Jake had a few more stronger scenes to work with. It's Heath who actually got the most tear-jerking moments, and yes, his performance is compelling, and heartbreaking, especially the last fifteen minutes.Ang Lee had done a great job making this film visually stunning and emotionally powerful, even though the love scenes are rather low-key. The cinematography captures the most beautiful images of the mountains, sheeps, rivers, and lakes. The original score and theme song are quite memorable. This film is going to have a huge following of gay audiences, but it's also a must-see for the mainstream crowds, because it's truly the year's most unforgetable romantic movie!",5,Jake and Heath!,1134691200,"12 16, 2005",2005,3605,"['First', 'am', 'so', 'relieved', 'have', 'finally', 'seen', 'film', 'so', 'much', 'anticipation', 'was', 'moved', 'tears', 'had', 'expected', 'been', 'so', 'long', 'have', 'been', 'so', 'taken', 'romantic', 'movie', 'Brokeback', 'Mountain', 'beautiful', 'emotionally', 'impacting', 'films', 'Happy', 'Together', 'Tony', 'Leung', 'Intimates', 'Carina', 'Lau', 'English', 'Patient', 'Ralph', 'Fiennes', 'such', 'treat', 'see', 'Jake', 'Gyllenhaal', 'Heath', 'Ledger', 'meticulous', 'direction', 'Ang', 'Lee', 'agree', 'Lee', 'film', 'beautiful', 'love', 'story', 'not', 'gay', 'cowboy', 'movie.Brokeback', 'Mountain', 'beautiful', 'mountain', 'landscape', 'Alberta', 'stand', 'Wyoming', 'mountains', 'place', 'where', 'Jack', 'Gyllenhaal', 'Ennis', 'Ledger', 'spent', 'first', 'year', 'mid', ""'60s"", 'working', 'together', 'cowboys', 'tending', 'sheeps', 'two', 'lonesome', 'cowboys', 'clashed', 'first', 'eventual', 'became', 'friends', 'secret', 'lovers', 'Jack', 'sexy', 'rebellious', 'one', 'Ennis', 'emotionally', 'sexually', 'confused', 'first', 'did', ""n't"", 'want', 'acknowledge', 'feelings', 'other', 'were', 'separated', 'four', 'years', 'started', 'miss', 'other', 'four', 'years', 'got', 'married', 'led', 'normal', 'life', 'had', 'kids', 'Ennis', 'wife', 'Alma', 'Michelle', 'Williams', 'eventually', 'found', 'out', 'cheating', 'Jack', 'never', 'actually', 'confronted', 'years', 'later', 'Jack', 'had', 'been', 'relocated', 'Texas', 'marrying', 'beautiful', 'wealthy', 'Laureen', 'Anne', 'Hathway', '.When', 'Jack', 'Ennis', 'were', 'reunited', 'reignited', 'old', 'passion', 'lust', 'other', 'occasionally', 'went', 'up', 'Brokeback', 'Mountain', 'have', 'secret', 'romantic', 'getaways', 'pretending', 'be', 'fishing', 'trips', 'Jack', 'feeling', 'Ennis', 'grew', 'stronger', 'gradually', 'suggested', 'move', 'away', 'live', 'together', 'Ennis', 'homophobia', 'own', 'fear', 'possible', 'alienation', 'condemnation', 'just', 'wanted', 'keep', 'once', 'blue', 'moon', 'deal', 'time', 'passes', 'twenty', 'years', 'later', 'are', 'middle', 'aged', 'men', 'still', 'going', 'same', 'old', 'pattern', 'Jack', 'resentful', 'towards', 'Ennis', 'had', 'wasted', 'half', 'life', 'loving', 'not', 'having', 'entirely', 'even', 'when', 'had', 'already', 'been', 'divorced', 'Alma', 'years.This', 'film', 'scene', 'stealing', 'Michelle', 'Williams', 'scene', 'when', 'Alma', 'saw', 'Ennis', 'kissing', 'hugging', 'Jack', 'house', 'was', 'so', 'funny', 'shocking', 'was', 'mesmerizing', 'when', 'had', 'heart-to-heart', 'confrontation', 'Ennis', 'Anne', 'Hathway', 'less', 'screentime', 'less', 'challenging', 'role', 'work', 'wear', 'different', 'kinds', 'wigs', 'final', 'scene', 'when', 'tragic', 'news', 'Ennis', 'was', 'big', 'moment', 'enjoyed', 'watching', 'scene', 'Jake', 'Heath', 'actually', 'Jake', 'character', 'more', 'knew', 'what', 'wanted', 'was', 'not', 'afraid', 'love', 'man', 'life', 'was', 'very', 'moved', 'final', 'scene', 'was', 'kind', 'long', 'most', 'dramatic', 'two', 'leads', 'wished', 'Jake', 'had', 'few', 'more', 'stronger', 'scenes', 'work', 'Heath', 'who', 'actually', 'got', 'most', 'tear-jerking', 'moments', 'yes', 'performance', 'compelling', 'heartbreaking', 'especially', 'last', 'fifteen', 'minutes.Ang', 'Lee', 'had', 'done', 'great', 'job', 'making', 'film', 'visually', 'stunning', 'emotionally', 'powerful', 'even', 'love', 'scenes', 'are', 'rather', 'low-key', 'cinematography', 'most', 'beautiful', 'images', 'mountains', 'sheeps', 'rivers', 'lakes', 'original', 'score', 'theme', 'song', 'are', 'quite', 'memorable', 'film', 'going', 'have', 'huge', 'following', 'gay', 'audiences', 'also', 'must-see', 'mainstream', 'crowds', 'truly', 'year', 'most', 'unforgetable', 'romantic', 'movie']",N/A

Heath Ledger and Jake Gylenhall gave outstanding performances.  The two played cowboys, Ennis(Ledger) and Jack(Gylenhall), who fell inlove while tending to sheep over the summer.  Living in a time and place where homosexuality was unnaceptable, they each got married and had children.  However, their love for eachother never ended and they would go on ""fishing trips"" a couple times a year to be with eachother.  This was a good love story and you really feel for the characters.  Aside from a couple overly dramatized scenes, this movie really didn't have any major flaws.  The acting, writing, and cinematography were all perfect.

Something about this movie though seemed to fall flat. The acting was wooden and the emotions seemed fake. It wasn't really a great love story and seemed to lack real passion. After the first time, all of their meetings seemed painful, unsatisfying and not worth the effort. The overall tone of the movie was moody and I found the ending a little anti-climactic. I really respect the fact that writers and studios are getting brave enough to branch out and make movies about taboo subjects like this. It was a good effort but not a great movie. It wasn't terrible, it just left me feeling empty. It's kind of a depressing storyline with not a lot of happy moments, just a lot of pain, drama and problems. There seemed to be little chemistry between the two actors. Let me just say, I have no problem with people being gay and I would have felt the same way if this was a heterosexual story! There just were no sparks, and the movie came off as cold or lukewarm at best.",3,Not all it's made out to be,1166054400,"12 14, 2006",2006,1083,"['thought', 'movie', 'was', 'missing', 'something', 'liked', 'concept', 'liked', 'setting', 'liked', 'love', 'scenes', 'Something', 'movie', 'seemed', 'fall', 'flat', 'acting', 'was', 'wooden', 'emotions', 'seemed', 'fake', 'was', ""n't"", 'really', 'great', 'love', 'story', 'seemed', 'lack', 'real', 'passion', 'first', 'time', 'meetings', 'seemed', 'painful', 'unsatisfying', 'not', 'effort', 'overall', 'tone', 'movie', 'was', 'moody', 'found', 'ending', 'little', 'anti-climactic', 'really', 'respect', 'fact', 'writers', 'studios', 'are', 'getting', 'brave', 'enough', 'branch', 'out', 'make', 'movies', 'taboo', 'subjects', 'was', 'good', 'effort', 'not', 'great', 'movie', 'was', ""n't"", 'terrible', 'just', 'left', 'feeling', 'empty', 'kind', 'depressing', 'storyline', 'not', 'lot', 'happy', 'moments', 'just', 'lot', 'pain', 'drama', 'problems', 'seemed', 'be', 'little', 'chemistry', 'two', 'actors', 'Let', 'just', 'say', 'have', 'problem', 'people', 'being', 'gay', 'would', 'have', 'felt', 'same', 'way', 'was', 'heterosexual', 'story', 'just', 'were', 'sparks', 'movie', 'came', 'off', 'cold', 'lukewarm', 'best']",N/A

I loved the cinematography and I thought Heath Ledger's performance was the most genuine, believable and less restrained out of the two.  Jake Gyeggenhal's performance seemed rehearsed and not from the heart.  It was the first time I noticed Heath Ledger was a very soulful person, I could tell by his performance.  The problem I had with the movie is the characters.  They both led double lives and were I'm assuming, ""bisexual"".  I live the gay lifestyle and let me tell you there is nothing worse than a man trying to come off as straight when he is totally gay, especially ""cowboys""!  They knew what they really wanted, yet they deceived woman in the process and had kids no less.  I'm sorry but in my book, that's called BEING PHONY, and is also counter-productive for the gay community.  I don't care where they lived or what time this story took place in (the early 60's).  They could have moved to New York or West Hollywood, they had resources back then.  Don't tell me they didn't know anything about it, that's why the Jack character went all the way down to Mexico to get it.  He knew where to get it.  It's these type of people who ruin it for REAL homosexuals. they give us a bad name and they confuse everybody in the process.  It would have been better if Jack was the true homosexual instead of making them both bisexual.  I liked the story of ""Boy's Don't Cry"" better.  At least Hillary Swank's character knew what she wanted and went to no lenths to become a boy to avoid all this confusion and blurred lines of sexuality.  In my own oppinion, it's these white cowboys who need to stop playing games and represent.  Confused individuals are ironically back in the closet again and it's time for another generation to learn AGAIN how to love themselves and live their authentic lives.  It can be no other way.  The consequences of deceiving people about your lifestyle have great reprocussions later on in life as this movie demonstrates. Gay people need to be proud of who they are.",3,True Lies,1221696000,"09 18, 2008",2008,2053,"['had', 'feeling', 'was', ""n't"", 'going', 'like', 'movie', 'loved', 'cinematography', 'thought', 'Heath', 'Ledger', 'performance', 'was', 'most', 'genuine', 'believable', 'less', 'restrained', 'two', 'Jake', 'Gyeggenhal', 'performance', 'seemed', 'rehearsed', 'not', 'heart', 'was', 'first', 'time', 'noticed', 'Heath', 'Ledger', 'was', 'very', 'soulful', 'person', 'could', 'tell', 'performance', 'problem', 'had', 'movie', 'characters', 'led', 'double', 'lives', 'were', ""'m"", 'assuming', 'bisexual', 'live', 'gay', 'lifestyle', 'let', 'tell', 'nothing', 'worse', 'man', 'trying', 'come', 'off', 'straight', 'when', 'totally', 'gay', 'especially', 'cowboys', 'knew', 'what', 'really', 'wanted', 'yet', 'deceived', 'woman', 'process', 'had', 'kids', 'less', ""'m"", 'sorry', 'book', 'called', 'BEING', 'PHONY', 'also', 'counter-productive', 'gay', 'community', 'do', ""n't"", 'care', 'where', 'lived', 'what', 'time', 'story', 'took', 'place', 'early', '60', 'could', 'have', 'moved', 'New', 'York', 'West', 'Hollywood', 'had', 'resources', 'back', 'then', 'Do', ""n't"", 'tell', 'did', ""n't"", 'know', 'anything', 'why', 'Jack', 'character', 'went', 'way', 'Mexico', 'get', 'knew', 'where', 'get', 'type', 'people', 'who', 'ruin', 'REAL', 'homosexuals', 'give', 'bad', 'name', 'confuse', 'everybody', 'process', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'better', 'Jack', 'was', 'true', 'homosexual', 'instead', 'making', 'bisexual', 'liked', 'story', 'Boy', 'Do', ""n't"", 'Cry', 'better', 'least', 'Hillary', 'Swank', 'character', 'knew', 'what', 'wanted', 'went', 'lenths', 'become', 'boy', 'avoid', 'confusion', 'blurred', 'lines', 'sexuality', 'own', 'oppinion', 'white', 'cowboys', 'who', 'need', 'stop', 'playing', 'games', 'represent', 'Confused', 'individuals', 'are', 'ironically', 'back', 'closet', 'again', 'time', 'generation', 'learn', 'AGAIN', 'how', 'love', 'live', 'authentic', 'lives', 'can', 'be', 'other', 'way', 'consequences', 'deceiving', 'people', 'lifestyle', 'have', 'great', 'reprocussions', 'later', 'life', 'movie', 'Gay', 'people', 'need', 'be', 'proud', 'who', 'are']",N/A
