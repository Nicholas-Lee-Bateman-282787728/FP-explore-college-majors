1062184,AQIO9QHHPFFET,B000O59A2A,Brendan M. Howard,"[7, 7]","Preliminary reviews for this collection say viewers should just buy the two seasons of the show. I agree. But pound for pound, minute for minute, the highlights of this show beat out 95 percent of any year's crop of film or TV comedies. This is two-and-a-half hours of inappropriate race-obsessed laughter. It can occupy the same spot asLate Night with Conan O'Brien - The Best of Triumph the Insult Comic Dogas the perfect crack-em-up closer to any party. This is the guaranteed laugh you need when nothing else will do. Skit-based comedy is perfect for repurposing, as ""Saturday Night Live"" has discovered, and there's no reason there shouldn't be a best-of for ""Chappelle's Show"" to serve the same function.Best of all: ""Chappelle's Show"" wipes the street with the best of ""SNL.""",4,This IS the best!,1179878400,"05 23, 2007",2007,782,"['Preliminary', 'reviews', 'collection', 'say', 'viewers', 'should', 'just', 'buy', 'two', 'seasons', 'show', 'agree', 'pound', 'pound', 'minute', 'minute', 'highlights', 'show', 'beat', 'out', '95', 'percent', 'year', 'crop', 'film', 'TV', 'comedies', 'two-and-a-half', 'hours', 'inappropriate', 'race-obsessed', 'laughter', 'can', 'occupy', 'same', 'spot', 'asLate', 'Night', 'Conan', ""O'Brien"", 'Best', 'Triumph', 'Insult', 'Comic', 'Dogas', 'perfect', 'crack-em-up', 'closer', 'party', 'guaranteed', 'laugh', 'need', 'when', 'nothing', 'else', 'will', 'do', 'Skit-based', 'comedy', 'perfect', 'repurposing', 'Saturday', 'Night', 'Live', 'discovered', 'reason', 'there', 'should', ""n't"", 'be', 'best-of', 'Chappelle', 'Show', 'serve', 'same', 'function.Best', 'Chappelle', 'Show', 'street', 'best', 'SNL']",The Best of Chappelle's Show Uncensored

Chappelle channels the spirits of both Prince and Rick James in Charlie Murphy's True Hollywood Stories so well it proves that comedy taken from real life is usually the funniest and Dave's commitment to character is a pleasure to watch.

I wanted to note a couple of things others have said.This DVD has EVERY good episode of the Dave Chappelle show.  Period.  It even has the other Charlie Murphy/Rick James stories that aren't on the other DVDs.  There's really no reason to buy the other seasons if you buy this one, unless you're just a completionist.  To the person that said this DVD is pointless: it's not.  The season DVD sets are the pointless ones.One star down for one thing: the lie that is ""uncensored"".  You should understand that this DVD is not ""uncensored"".  A better term would be ""unfiltered"" - meaning the swearing is left in, but other than that, it's quite censored.  A good example is the Charlie Murphy/Rick James story at the China Club, where the breasts are censored.  Now I'm sure this was just part of the filming and all, but to me, if you're going to call something ""uncensored"", there should be...uh...no censoring.Don't let that deter you though.  If you're looking for Chappelle, just get this DVD and skip the others.  There were a lot of unfunny skits on the season DVDs.
