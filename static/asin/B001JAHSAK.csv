1206113,A200C7YQJ45LRR,B001JAHSAK,"Anthony Rupert ""shut up, Shut Up, SHUT UP!!!""","[11, 25]","I'll get right to the point: there are only two episodes from this entire season that really stand out. One is the two-part ""Breaking Up Is Hard to Do"", where Vivian mulls a separation from Philip; and the other is ""Not With My Cousin, You Don't"", where Ashley's boyfriend Derek (Jaleel White) tries to convince her to lose her virginity. The rest of the season's episodes seemed like they were based on storylines that were left over from previous seasons (especially the season's opener, ""Burnin' Down the House"" -- and why was Carlton still going to camp at that age?). The writers even tried to give Ashley a pair of transparent friends to hang out with (kinda likethe last season of the Cosby Showwhen the writers set Rudy up with Susan and Danielle).Another thing about this season is that it relied too much on style over substance; ""style"" being celebrity cameos (Chris Rock in ""Get a Job""; William Shatner in ""Eye, Tooth""). There's nothing necessarily wrong with that per se, but the cameos were so blatant: the guest star would walk into a previously empty room, which would be the cue for the audience to applaud (and the audience never did).But now that I think about it, the final episode was pretty good too, especially when Will was saying goodbye to Geoffrey. Still, since Will Smith was moving on to bigger and better things by the time 1995 rolled around, it seemed like he didn't have his heart in the show any more. I don't think this season will be released any time soon (if at all), but if it does happen, as I said before, only get it to make your Fresh Prince of Bel-Air collection complete.Anthony Rupert",3,Buy this only to complete your Fresh Prince collection,1258243200,"11 15, 2009",2009,1630,"[""'ll"", 'get', 'right', 'point', 'are', 'only', 'two', 'episodes', 'entire', 'season', 'really', 'stand', 'out', 'One', 'two-part', 'Breaking', 'Up', 'Hard', 'Do', 'where', 'Vivian', 'separation', 'Philip', 'other', 'Not', 'My', 'Cousin', 'Do', ""n't"", 'where', 'Ashley', 'boyfriend', 'Derek', 'Jaleel', 'White', 'convince', 'lose', 'virginity', 'rest', 'season', 'episodes', 'seemed', 'were', 'based', 'storylines', 'were', 'left', 'over', 'previous', 'seasons', 'especially', 'season', 'opener', 'Burnin', 'Down', 'House', 'why', 'was', 'Carlton', 'still', 'going', 'camp', 'age', 'writers', 'even', 'tried', 'give', 'Ashley', 'pair', 'transparent', 'friends', 'hang', 'out', 'kinda', 'likethe', 'last', 'season', 'Cosby', 'Showwhen', 'writers', 'set', 'Rudy', 'up', 'Susan', 'Danielle', 'thing', 'season', 'relied', 'too', 'much', 'style', 'substance', 'style', 'being', 'celebrity', 'cameos', 'Chris', 'Rock', 'Get', 'Job', 'William', 'Shatner', 'Eye', 'Tooth', 'nothing', 'necessarily', 'wrong', 'per', 'se', 'cameos', 'were', 'so', 'blatant', 'guest', 'star', 'would', 'walk', 'previously', 'empty', 'room', 'would', 'be', 'cue', 'audience', 'applaud', 'audience', 'never', 'did', '.But', 'now', 'think', 'final', 'episode', 'was', 'pretty', 'good', 'too', 'especially', 'when', 'Will', 'was', 'saying', 'goodbye', 'Geoffrey', 'Still', 'Will', 'Smith', 'was', 'moving', 'bigger', 'better', 'things', 'time', '1995', 'rolled', 'around', 'seemed', 'did', ""n't"", 'have', 'heart', 'show', 'more', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'season', 'will', 'be', 'released', 'time', 'soon', 'happen', 'said', 'only', 'get', 'make', 'Fresh', 'Prince', 'Bel-Air', 'collection', 'complete.Anthony', 'Rupert']",N/A

If you watched the first to last season you would have witnessed the transformation of Will Smith from child to adult.

By the last episode, we have a young man that not only fits in but is basically the spirit of the household. Everyone is moving on. The family to NY and Will has no place to go but doesn't want to say anything because he doesn't want to be a burden. This is a heartfelt ending that can move you to tears.

Will doesn't quite avert a disaster, as he destroys his uncle's kitchen in the season premiere episode titled ""Burnin' Down The House""! The family is up against a deranged man wearing a clown suit in ""I, Clownius"" - who'll do anything for a laugh! A young man claiming to be Geoffrey's long-lost son shows up in ""The Butler's Son Did It"" - only he wants something. William Shatner guest-stars in ""Eye, Tooth"" - with Carlton getting on his nerves at every possible moment! Carlton passes up Princeton for a bowling career in ""I, Bowl Buster"", & after being ridiculed after being knocked out by a woman boxer, Will can't live it down in the episode ""Boxing Helena"". The gambling bug hits Carlton during a trip to Vegas in ""Viva Lost Wages"" & Hilary is all excited about her talk show going national in ""I, Ooh, Baby, Baby"". Phil's political ambitions interfere with his marriage in the two-part episode ""Breaking Up Is Hard To Do"", so the kids do all they can to get Uncle Phil & Aunt Viv back together. Everyone's excited about facing exciting & new challenges in their lives in the two-part series finale ""I, Done"". Part One finds Vivian & Phil making plans to move to the east coast, Geoffrey moving back to London & Ashley & Hilary moving to New York City & Carlton resuming his education @ Princeton. In Part Two, it is learned everyone has plans except Will, who hasn't yet found a place to live. Phil sells the mansion, with Will handling the transaction. Sherman Hemsley, Isabel Sanford, Conrad Bain & Gary Coleman have guest-starring cameos. Will moves back to Philly to be with Vy & resume his education. After six seasons & 148 episodes, ""The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air"" ends its run. Will Smith, who became a breakout, bonafide star during the sitcom's third season, began acting in movies around that time, & would become a full-fledged movie star after the series ended. As is often the case, good things do indeed come to an end, but with your DVD watching, ""The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air - The Complete Sixth Season"", including the previous five seasons, can air in reruns indefinitely.

Like any other great sitcom, it was no suprise that this show has ""jumped the shark"" and I believe it has since the beginning of season 5.  Other than the Thanksgiving episodes, the episode with Jaleel White, and the series finale (only 5), there was not one episode from this season that I can enjoy.  I think the jokes and the acting on this season were also forced (more so than the previous season) not to mention way more obnoxious.  The last episode from season 5 pretty much leaves off with a cliff hanger (what ever happen to Lisa, Will's fiance who decided not to marry him?).  How low can the series stoop on a season premiere where Will burns down the kitchen by stupidly cooking flambee because he was bored?  How much longer can I stand Will lip-synching to ""And I'm Telling You I'm Not Goin'?""  How dumber and louder can Carlton get?  How drier can Vivian be?  On the final season, the script and acting expresses more than words on how tired Will Smith was with the series and wanted to pursue other opportunities such as getting involved with more movies.
