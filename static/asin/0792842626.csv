149179,ANCOMAI0I7LVG,0792842626,Andrew Ellington,"[9, 9]","I adore European films (German, Russian, Hungarian) and so I was really anxious to get my hands on `Hitlerjunge Salomon' (also known as `Europa Europa').  The film is gloriously shot, with beautifully engaging cinematography; from claustrophobic indoor sets to vastly luminous outdoor cascades, but it is the engaging story itself that will leave you more than spellbound.  `Europa Europa' is a true story that is as tragic as it is uplifting as we watch this young man struggle to survive in a cold world bent on his destruction.`Europa Europa' tells us the story of young Salomon `Solly' Perel who is separated from his family during the Holocaust.  Solly and his brother Isaak are separated while trying to flee to Poland.  In order to spare his life, young Solly poses as a German and joins the German army.  He becomes a war hero and is accepted into the Hitler Youth.  He becomes everything he knows he should loathe in order to save himself, and this transformation takes its toll on the man he is slowly becoming.  As he forms relationships with individuals who would kill him if they only knew, Solly is constantly guarded, never allowing anyone to really get inside of his soul; and this barrier begins to rot away at the core of this young man.The film as a whole reminds me somewhat of `The Pianist' in its ability to truly move a person.  It is a courageous tale of the triumph of spirit and survival, and young Marco Hofschneider is miraculously moving (as was Adrian Brody).Hofschneider marvelously shifts between his characters emotional state, allowing us to see him for who he truly is, and not the guarded faade he puts up for those around him.  We never lose sight of the fact that Solly is but a boy, really, but we also see how his dire situations age him drastically.  His fragile movements, subtle and powerful, cause our own emotions to stir.  The actors around Hofschneider all do their best to elevate his performance, but in the end they all take a backseat to his brilliance.It's really no wonder the Academy nominated this film for Adapted Screenplay; it's only a shame that German didn't submit the film for `foreign picture' for I'm sure it would have won the Oscar.Much like `The Pianist', `Europa Europa' feels as though it will never reach its uplifting conclusion, but it does, and when it does we are left with such a warm and blessed feeling in our souls.  The film is glorious from start to finish, depicting the horrors of war and the effect it has on our youth (the character of young Leni alone is a tragic warning of what war is doing to our children) as well as the touching realities of family and that everlasting bond between blood.  There are few films that can truly inspire with such effortless ease, and `Europa Europa' is a dynamic example of how effective good filmmaking can be.",5,A startling true story of survival...,1223856000,"10 13, 2008",2008,2832,"['adore', 'European', 'films', 'German', 'Russian', 'Hungarian', 'so', 'was', 'really', 'anxious', 'get', 'hands', 'Hitlerjunge', 'Salomon', 'also', 'known', 'Europa', 'Europa', 'film', 'gloriously', 'shot', 'beautifully', 'engaging', 'cinematography', 'claustrophobic', 'indoor', 'sets', 'vastly', 'luminous', 'outdoor', 'cascades', 'engaging', 'story', 'will', 'leave', 'more', 'spellbound', 'Europa', 'Europa', 'true', 'story', 'as', 'tragic', 'uplifting', 'watch', 'young', 'man', 'struggle', 'survive', 'cold', 'world', 'bent', 'destruction.', 'Europa', 'Europa', 'tells', 'story', 'young', 'Salomon', 'Solly', 'Perel', 'who', 'separated', 'family', 'Holocaust', 'Solly', 'brother', 'Isaak', 'are', 'separated', 'trying', 'flee', 'Poland', 'order', 'spare', 'life', 'young', 'Solly', 'German', 'German', 'army', 'war', 'hero', 'accepted', 'Hitler', 'Youth', 'everything', 'should', 'loathe', 'order', 'save', 'transformation', 'toll', 'man', 'slowly', 'becoming', 'relationships', 'individuals', 'who', 'would', 'kill', 'only', 'knew', 'Solly', 'constantly', 'guarded', 'never', 'allowing', 'anyone', 'really', 'get', 'soul', 'barrier', 'rot', 'away', 'core', 'young', 'man.The', 'film', 'whole', 'Pianist', 'ability', 'truly', 'move', 'person', 'courageous', 'tale', 'triumph', 'spirit', 'survival', 'young', 'Marco', 'Hofschneider', 'miraculously', 'moving', 'was', 'Adrian', 'Brody', '.Hofschneider', 'marvelously', 'shifts', 'characters', 'emotional', 'state', 'allowing', 'see', 'who', 'truly', 'not', 'guarded', 'faade', 'up', 'never', 'lose', 'sight', 'fact', 'Solly', 'boy', 'really', 'also', 'see', 'how', 'dire', 'situations', 'age', 'drastically', 'fragile', 'movements', 'subtle', 'powerful', 'cause', 'own', 'emotions', 'stir', 'actors', 'Hofschneider', 'do', 'best', 'elevate', 'performance', 'end', 'take', 'backseat', 'brilliance.It', 'really', 'wonder', 'Academy', 'nominated', 'film', 'Adapted', 'Screenplay', 'only', 'shame', 'German', 'did', ""n't"", 'submit', 'film', 'foreign', 'picture', ""'m"", 'sure', 'would', 'have', 'won', 'Oscar.Much', 'Pianist', 'Europa', 'Europa', 'feels', 'will', 'never', 'reach', 'uplifting', 'conclusion', 'when', 'are', 'left', 'warm', 'blessed', 'feeling', 'souls', 'film', 'glorious', 'start', 'finish', 'depicting', 'horrors', 'war', 'effect', 'youth', 'character', 'young', 'Leni', 'alone', 'tragic', 'warning', 'what', 'war', 'doing', 'children', 'as', 'well', 'touching', 'realities', 'family', 'everlasting', 'bond', 'blood', 'are', 'few', 'films', 'can', 'truly', 'inspire', 'such', 'effortless', 'ease', 'Europa', 'Europa', 'dynamic', 'example', 'how', 'effective', 'good', 'filmmaking', 'can', 'be']",Europa Europa VHS
149180,A2YM0JQI2IO0VS,0792842626,"B. Berthold ""brad13""","[4, 4]","Most Holocaust films focus on the horrors of the death camps or devolve into clich&eacute;-ridden war films.  Polish director, Agnieszka Holland`s `Europa, Europa` is one of the few that dares to present a different side.  `Europa, Europa`s` originality lies in its devastating ability to show what it meant to survive as a Jewish person inside the Third Reich.Solomon Perel`s story is as incredulous as it is moving.  Youngest son of a German-Jewish family, he escapes the vandalism and murder of Kristalnacht (his sister does not) and migrates with his family to Lodz, Poland where they naively believe they will be safe from harm.  Then, September 1939 arrives and Poland exists no more, eviscerated by two tyrants. Solomon`s father sends him and his brother as far east as possible.  Reaching Soviet Poland, Solly becomes a Komosol member and embraces Bolshevism as the best way to survive.  Yet, safety is not to be as Hitler soon invades Stalin`s Empire.  Joining the refugee flotsam streaming eastward, Solly is soon apprehended by the advancing Germans.  Since Nazi policy was to immediately exterminate all Jewish prisoners, Solly uses his perfect German to escape detection.  Pretending to be a Volksdeutsch (German living outside the Reich), Solly once again embraces his new found masters in order to survive.  He joins a Wehrmacht unit and despite attempting to escape is sent to a Hitler Youth school in Germany as a reward for his courage.  Here, Solly endures his most tortuous of days as any lapse in vigilance could instantly betray his Jewish origins.  Finally, Allied bombs and the Soviet advance free Solly from his hellish prison.Such is Solomon Perel`s incredible story and Holland`s amazing film manages to capture Solly`s head spinning peregrinations without ever lapsing into monotony.  Each step of Solomon`s miraculous life is documented with color and drama. A sense of impending doom accompanies Solly`s every move.  Will he be found out and when?  Holland`s film masterfully captures the maddening paranoia that must have gripped every European Jew in hiding.  The cost of living a lie in order to survive is shown in excruciating detail.  Solly knows his Achilles` heel is his circumcision and goes to absurd lengths to hide it.  He avoids intimacy with his girlfriend at the Nazi school and even tries to stretch back his foreskin in a near-tragic experiment.When a German soldier befriends Solly and discovers his `difference,`he refuses to turn him.  The film shows that while National Socialism infected German society as a whole, not everybody was corrupted by its poison.  The German soldier feels a kinship with Solomon.  A homosexual, the soldier himself has had to hide his true self in order to escape the concentration camps. `Europa, Europa` captures the essence of what it means to betray one`s self in order to survive.Moreover, Holland`s film shows just how monolithically racist a society the Nazis succeeded in creating.  Neighbors attack Solomon`s family on Kristalnacht, and yet, a neighbor girl is the only one who helps Solly after the attack.  Holland juxtaposes the individual humanity of a few with the collective madness of the rest.  It is this collective madness that the film so tellingly portrays.  While at his Nazi school, Solly must learn the fundamentals of `racial science.`  As the fanatic teacher takes calipers to Solly`s head, the young students gawk in fear and awe.  Scenes such as these show just how profoundly German children were brainwashed by Nazi ideology.Marco Hofschneider`s portrayal of Solomon is full of pathos and sensitivity. His performance highlights the psychological costs of Solomon`s double life.  In her portrayal as Solly`s girlfriend at the Hitler Youth school, Julie Delpy shows presence and believability as an arrogant youth thoroughly poisoned by the lies of Nazi ideology.  In fact, all the roles in this remarkable film are played with a rare accuracy and attention to detail.  `Europa, Europa` is a powerful film that will help the viewer better understand what life was like for those caught in the insanity of Hitler`s Third Reich.",5,Europa Europa,1294876800,"01 13, 2011",2011,4135,"['Most', 'Holocaust', 'films', 'focus', 'horrors', 'death', 'camps', 'devolve', 'clich', 'eacute', '-ridden', 'war', 'films', 'Polish', 'director', 'Agnieszka', 'Holland', 's', 'Europa', 'Europa', 'one', 'few', 'present', 'different', 'side', 'Europa', 'Europa', 's', 'originality', 'devastating', 'ability', 'show', 'what', 'meant', 'survive', 'Jewish', 'person', 'Third', 'Reich.Solomon', 'Perel', 's', 'story', 'as', 'incredulous', 'moving', 'Youngest', 'son', 'German-Jewish', 'family', 'vandalism', 'murder', 'Kristalnacht', 'sister', 'not', 'family', 'Lodz', 'Poland', 'where', 'naively', 'believe', 'will', 'be', 'safe', 'harm', 'Then', 'September', '1939', 'arrives', 'Poland', 'more', 'eviscerated', 'two', 'tyrants', 'Solomon', 's', 'father', 'brother', 'far', 'east', 'possible', 'Reaching', 'Soviet', 'Poland', 'Solly', 'Komosol', 'member', 'Bolshevism', 'best', 'way', 'survive', 'safety', 'not', 'be', 'Hitler', 'soon', 'Stalin', 's', 'Empire', 'Joining', 'refugee', 'flotsam', 'streaming', 'eastward', 'Solly', 'soon', 'apprehended', 'advancing', 'Germans', 'Nazi', 'policy', 'was', 'immediately', 'exterminate', 'Jewish', 'prisoners', 'Solly', 'perfect', 'German', 'escape', 'detection', 'Pretending', 'be', 'Volksdeutsch', 'German', 'living', 'Reich', 'Solly', 'once', 'again', 'new', 'found', 'masters', 'order', 'survive', 'Wehrmacht', 'unit', 'attempting', 'escape', 'sent', 'Hitler', 'Youth', 'school', 'Germany', 'reward', 'courage', 'Here', 'Solly', 'most', 'tortuous', 'days', 'lapse', 'vigilance', 'could', 'instantly', 'betray', 'Jewish', 'origins', 'Finally', 'Allied', 'bombs', 'Soviet', 'advance', 'free', 'Solly', 'hellish', 'prison.Such', 'Solomon', 'Perel', 's', 'incredible', 'story', 'Holland', 's', 'amazing', 'film', 'manages', 'capture', 'Solly', 's', 'head', 'spinning', 'peregrinations', 'ever', 'lapsing', 'monotony', 'step', 'Solomon', 's', 'miraculous', 'life', 'documented', 'color', 'drama', 'sense', 'impending', 'doom', 'accompanies', 'Solly', 's', 'move', 'Will', 'be', 'found', 'out', 'when', 'Holland', 's', 'film', 'masterfully', 'maddening', 'paranoia', 'must', 'have', 'gripped', 'European', 'Jew', 'hiding', 'cost', 'living', 'lie', 'order', 'survive', 'shown', 'excruciating', 'detail', 'Solly', 'Achilles', 'heel', 'circumcision', 'absurd', 'lengths', 'hide', 'intimacy', 'girlfriend', 'Nazi', 'school', 'even', 'tries', 'stretch', 'back', 'foreskin', 'near-tragic', 'experiment.When', 'German', 'soldier', 'befriends', 'Solly', 'difference', 'turn', 'film', 'National', 'Socialism', 'infected', 'German', 'society', 'whole', 'not', 'everybody', 'was', 'corrupted', 'poison', 'German', 'soldier', 'kinship', 'Solomon', 'homosexual', 'soldier', 'had', 'hide', 'true', 'self', 'order', 'escape', 'concentration', 'camps', 'Europa', 'Europa', 'essence', 'what', 'betray', 'one', 's', 'self', 'order', 'survive.Moreover', 'Holland', 's', 'film', 'shows', 'just', 'how', 'monolithically', 'racist', 'society', 'Nazis', 'succeeded', 'creating', 'Neighbors', 'attack', 'Solomon', 's', 'family', 'Kristalnacht', 'yet', 'neighbor', 'girl', 'only', 'one', 'who', 'Solly', 'attack', 'Holland', 'individual', 'humanity', 'few', 'collective', 'madness', 'rest', 'collective', 'madness', 'film', 'so', 'tellingly', 'portrays', 'Nazi', 'school', 'Solly', 'must', 'learn', 'fundamentals', 'racial', 'science.', 'fanatic', 'teacher', 'calipers', 'Solly', 's', 'head', 'young', 'students', 'gawk', 'fear', 'awe', 'Scenes', 'such', 'show', 'just', 'how', 'profoundly', 'German', 'children', 'were', 'brainwashed', 'Nazi', 'ideology.Marco', 'Hofschneider', 's', 'portrayal', 'Solomon', 'full', 'pathos', 'sensitivity', 'performance', 'highlights', 'psychological', 'costs', 'Solomon', 's', 'double', 'life', 'portrayal', 'Solly', 's', 'girlfriend', 'Hitler', 'Youth', 'school', 'Julie', 'Delpy', 'presence', 'believability', 'arrogant', 'youth', 'thoroughly', 'poisoned', 'lies', 'Nazi', 'ideology', 'fact', 'roles', 'remarkable', 'film', 'are', 'played', 'rare', 'accuracy', 'attention', 'detail', 'Europa', 'Europa', 'powerful', 'film', 'will', 'help', 'viewer', 'better', 'understand', 'what', 'life', 'was', 'caught', 'insanity', 'Hitler', 's', 'Third', 'Reich']",Europa Europa VHS
149181,A2CW9IQAPFEYLM,0792842626,Bomojaz,"[6, 9]","Set during WW II, a young man (Marco Hofschneider), a German Jew, tries to flee the Nazis, but then, mainly through accident, realizes the best way to survive might be to become one. He goes to the Russian front with a Nazi regiment, and, about to surrender after his comrades are shot, in a huge turn of events, ends up looking like the leader of the group that forces the Russians to surrender instead. He is sent back to Germany a hero and enrolls in a Nazi-ruled school. His biggest problem, and the movie's funniest, is that he's circumsized, of course, and how he has to hide the fact. The horrors of the war, especially the brutality meted out against the Jews, are neatly, almost miraculously, balanced against this personal comedy/tragedy Hofschneider faces. Spun out through the movie are strange dreams/nightmares that Hofschneider has - he and Hitler hiding in a closet together, Hitler also hiding his own circumcision, and Hitler dancing with Stalin; these are witty and shocking at the same time. Based on a true story, it was  not a big hit in Germany, but elsewhere it was.

149184,AI2GILPGNEXUL,0792842626,Clayton,"[0, 7]","""Europa Europa"" is advertised as a motion picture concerning the varying identities a young Jewish male of sixteen years undertakes to stay alive during Nazi rule.  The film could have been be a fascinating portrait of identity shift and the psychological ability of human beings to adapt to tribulation; yet, one pervasive aspect destroys the credulity of the message.Sex.While the actor who portrayed Solomon was twenty years of age at the time of filming, the character he portrays is sixteen.  In the first few minutes of the film, full frontal nudity of the young man is presented.  It's a foreign film, no big deal, right?Wrong.  During the second full frontal scene of the film, Solomon is in a bathtub in a barn when a soldier (approximately fifty years of age) comes in and gives chase in an attempt at molestation.  There is actually hand to groin contact presented, which transforms the motion picture from educational to porn.Brace yourselves; it gets worse.  Solomon becomes best friends with the man who attempted to sexually defile him; they form a bond, which is destroyed when the older man is killed in the trenches.  The film, at this point, turns ludicrous.  In the molester's death sequence, operatic music begins to play as the camera pans above an inconsolable Solomon, weeping for his 'best friend'.This scene, literally a sixteen year old boy mourning for the man who would have raped him, is played out as though it were a Shakespearean denouement.Yet, the sexploitation is not finished.  Soon, young Solomon is sexually victimized by a female Nazi headmistress while on a train.  Evidently, Solomon enjoyed the experience, for he puts his head out a window and screams enthusiastically.This is a supposedly a noteworthy holocaust film concerning a young man grieving for the deaths of his family, his religion, and his way of life.

However, the inevitable German occupation forces Solomon and his brother Issac (Rene Hofschneider) to flee east and is seperated.  Solomon meets a kind Soviet officer and is taken to a Russian orphanage and becomes a Koccmatol- the Soviet equivalent to the Hitler Jugend with simular religious fixations for their leaders.  He spends three years there in Communist indocrination until the Hitler-Stalin pact is broken and Germany invades, leaving him to run before getting caught.  Solomon convinces the Nazis that he is a 'pure bred German' named Joseph Peters and they find his Russian languge skills usefull.A gay soldier that nearly molests him while bathing finds out his secret (Non-Jewish Germans even today is seldom circumcised), but because he is a 'different kind of German', he  befriends him instead of exposing him.  After a brief battle that leaves him as the only survivor in his group, an attempt to defect to the Russians instead results in their capture and inadvertantly becomes a hero.  A German officer takes a liking to him and holds an interest in adopting him, then sends him to a elite Hitler Youth school, where he would have a more difficult time hiding who he is.

He also falls in love with a beautiful and loyal Nazi girl, Leni (French actress Julie Delpy) whom he cannot be intimant with for obvious reasons and she instead uses his roomate so she can offer a child to the Reich.After a few monthes of close calls and a painful attempt to restore his foreskin, Solomon/Jupp fights against the Russian Front, deserts his company and surrenders to the Russians only to be saved by the skin of his teeth when his brother reconizes him before being executed.Interesting facts:The ending is a cinematic misnomer of a true story from what I've read as Solomon was merely liberated by Americans who learns the truth with the help of his brother.I saw a special about the holocaust with an interview with Solomon Perel, and he has blue eyes.  To be honest, I thought Marco and his brother, Rene had rather distinctive (and hansom) Semitic features and it does nicely in disproving Goethe's Aryan purity test in the classroom scene.Rene Hofschneider was origionally chosen to play Solomon, but after a couple years of budget constrants, by the time the film was set to shoot, it was decided that he was too old (I assume that he was over 20, cause his younger brother was over 18 himself at the time) and the role was given to Marco and he was cast as Issac.Now if your moral sensibilities are going to make you complain about the male nudity and the mature themes, which is common in Europian cinema, then maybe you should stick to the flat and mundane American films you feel so safe with.",5,Europa Europa,1057881600,"07 11, 2003",2003,3084,"['1938', 'eve', 'Bar', 'Mitzvah', 'Solomon', 'Perel', 'life', 'turned', 'upside', 'down', 'when', 'Nazi', 'rampage', 'results', 'sister', 'death', 'Solomon', 'Marco', 'Hofschneider', 'family', 'forced', 'move', 'L', 'oacute', 'zd', 'Poland', 'However', 'inevitable', 'German', 'occupation', 'forces', 'Solomon', 'brother', 'Issac', 'Rene', 'Hofschneider', 'flee', 'east', 'seperated', 'Solomon', 'kind', 'Soviet', 'officer', 'taken', 'Russian', 'orphanage', 'Koccmatol-', 'Soviet', 'equivalent', 'Hitler', 'Jugend', 'simular', 'religious', 'fixations', 'leaders', 'three', 'years', 'there', 'Communist', 'indocrination', 'Hitler-Stalin', 'pact', 'broken', 'Germany', 'invades', 'leaving', 'run', 'getting', 'caught', 'Solomon', 'Nazis', ""'pure"", 'bred', 'German', 'named', 'Joseph', 'Peters', 'find', 'Russian', 'languge', 'skills', 'usefull.A', 'gay', 'soldier', 'nearly', 'bathing', 'out', 'secret', 'Non-Jewish', 'Germans', 'even', 'today', 'seldom', 'circumcised', ""'different"", 'kind', 'German', 'instead', 'exposing', 'brief', 'battle', 'only', 'survivor', 'group', 'attempt', 'defect', 'Russians', 'instead', 'results', 'capture', 'inadvertantly', 'hero', 'German', 'officer', 'liking', 'interest', 'adopting', 'then', 'elite', 'Hitler', 'Youth', 'school', 'where', 'would', 'have', 'more', 'difficult', 'time', 'hiding', 'who', 'competitive', 'popular', 'deemed', 'be', ""'jewel"", 'authentic', 'Aryan', 'purity', 'series', 'head', 'measurments', 'comparison', 'samples', 'also', 'love', 'beautiful', 'loyal', 'Nazi', 'girl', 'Leni', 'French', 'actress', 'Julie', 'Delpy', 'whom', 'can', 'not', 'be', 'intimant', 'obvious', 'reasons', 'instead', 'roomate', 'can', 'offer', 'child', 'Reich.After', 'few', 'monthes', 'close', 'calls', 'painful', 'attempt', 'restore', 'foreskin', 'Solomon/Jupp', 'fights', 'Russian', 'Front', 'company', 'surrenders', 'Russians', 'only', 'be', 'saved', 'skin', 'teeth', 'when', 'brother', 'being', 'executed.Interesting', 'facts', 'ending', 'cinematic', 'misnomer', 'true', 'story', 'what', ""'ve"", 'read', 'Solomon', 'was', 'merely', 'liberated', 'Americans', 'who', 'truth', 'help', 'brother.I', 'saw', 'special', 'holocaust', 'interview', 'Solomon', 'Perel', 'blue', 'eyes', 'be', 'honest', 'thought', 'Marco', 'brother', 'Rene', 'had', 'rather', 'distinctive', 'hansom', 'Semitic', 'features', 'nicely', 'disproving', 'Goethe', 'Aryan', 'purity', 'test', 'classroom', 'scene.Rene', 'Hofschneider', 'was', 'origionally', 'chosen', 'play', 'Solomon', 'couple', 'years', 'budget', 'constrants', 'time', 'film', 'was', 'set', 'shoot', 'was', 'decided', 'was', 'too', 'old', 'assume', 'was', 'over', '20', 'cause', 'younger', 'brother', 'was', '18', 'time', 'role', 'was', 'given', 'Marco', 'was', 'cast', 'Issac.Now', 'moral', 'sensibilities', 'are', 'going', 'make', 'complain', 'male', 'nudity', 'mature', 'themes', 'common', 'Europian', 'cinema', 'then', 'maybe', 'should', 'stick', 'flat', 'mundane', 'American', 'films', 'feel', 'so', 'safe']",Europa Europa VHS

149188,APUHDIL2CEI3C,0792842626,Dr. Victor S. Alpher,"[83, 89]","This is one of the best films in the genre--historial film from autobiography.  Marco Hofschneider brings to brilliant life the story of Salamon Perel, a German Jew.  From the days of Kristallnacht--the Night of Broken Glass, when Jewish businesses were trashed and vandalized throughout Germany, to his final reunification with his brother--to poignant to say more about this here...this is a cinematic masterpiece.I've seen few films that capture the turmoil of adolescent identity and identification so well.  True, the Nazi era is the backdrop, but the themes couldn't be more universal.  In that respect, it is also more relevant today, in 2004, than during the 1980s, when it was filmed--especially in America, where the American identity has been deconstructed so as to be hardly palpable.  Also, it is equally relevant in Europe, where national distinctions could meld into a Confederacy if not a Union of some power.Politics aside, this is an intensely personal film, one where the unquestioned identity of youth (German) falls victim to oncoming War and cruel happenstance.  Perel must continually revise his vision OF himself and FOR himself, and at one point wishes for nothing more than to be an Nazi, for a beautiful young German girl becomes enfatuated with him.  How did he end up in this position, wearing the uniform of the Hitler Youth at an Elite boarding school in Berlin?  Or lose his virginity to a high-ranking female Party member while he is escorted by train from the Eastern Front to Berlin, as a Folk Hero (Volksdeutscher Held).  Perhaps you think it unimaginable.  I do not.I've seen places in German where the remnants of Jewish culture and tradition are clear as day--such as a former High School for Jews in Berlin--with Hebrew and German inscribed clearly in the stones.No, though Germany seems to some a heartless pillar of unemotionality, efficiency, heartlessness, the German characters in Europa, Europa are as human as those found anywhere.  They fall victim to their personal aspirations, desire to please, deceitfulness, betrayal...simply put, human.Although current fashion is to think of the period as one of the ""banality of evil"" (attributed to Hannah Arendt, Holocaust scholar), this film exposes the period as one more of human triumph and tragedy, and that, while we grow into adulthood, our personal identity is as much at the mercy of the passage of time and events as a unique, solitary construction.See this film!

And sometimes surviving completely because of luck and being in the right place at the right time. The main character here, a young German Jewish man, is forced to flee his home with his family from Germany to Poland. Then his parents force his brother and him to flee on their own. The boy is the only one to escape. Strangely he works with the German Army at one point because they find him and a group of Jewish people and are going to kill them. He manages to convince them he is German, and through a strange set of events, they believe him and take him under their wing and decide that he will be useful to them. Although his secret is discovered by one of the German officers (who is trying to molest him), he is not given up. Later when the Germans are fighting the Russians, the boy ends up in Russians' hands, and luckily, he speaks perfect Russian, so they accept him. He is sent to a Russian school and stays there for some time. Somehow he ends up back in the Germans' hands, which is all the more dangerous. A German officer takes a liking to him and sends him back to his home to attend a German (Nazi) school. He fits in relatively well, but he must endure the classes in which Jews are compared to rats. He is a highly competitive student and falls in love with a beautiful girl named Leni (played by Julie Delpy). In their relationship Leni is physically aggressive and wants to consummate their relationship in order to produce a child for Hitler's revolution. The boy cannot comply or he will be exposed. She angrily dumps him and takes up with his best friend, but the boy does visit Leni's mother who has by this time guessed his secret and also is a sympathetic ear. Eventually the war ends, and the boy is still working with the Germans and now he is going to be arrested with the other Germans (by Allied soldiers), but just when he is going to be taken away, a long line of Holocaust survivors wanders by and the boy spots his older brother, and he is proven to be Jewish.

149190,A15Q9YEG1XPEJN,0792842626,Get What We Give,"[10, 11]","Frankly, I'm quite tired of ""Oh how terribly persecuted the Jews were under Nazi Germany"" films.  However, I think that is because there was a flood of terribly mediocre films that were wildly popular because of the caustic nature of the subject matter.  A few of such films have been amazingly deep and leaps and bounds above the hollow sentimentality of the others:  Shindler's List, Aurevior Les Enfants, and Europa Europa are the three top that come to mind.Shindler's List deals with a broader subject matter and the benevolent nature of a German businessman and gentile:  Shindler.  Au revoir Les Enfants and Europa Europa deal with a much more personal story from the Jewish perspective.  They are about the children caught in the prejudice and the hatred.  Au revoir is from the childhood angle (in this French film) where Europa Europa (a German, Russian, and Polish film) deals with the subject matter from an adolescent/teenager's standpoint.Our lead character is a charming young Jewish boy, Solly (a boy new to acting - Marco Hofschneider), who upon Nazi occupation of Poland assumes the identity of a gentile to stay alive.  In doing so, Solly  - in some of the most physically painful moments of the film - attempts to disguise his circumcized penis be pulling skin forward on it and tying in place with string.  This is necessary as Solly joins up with Russian soldiers, joins the Nazi youth as an exemplary example of the Aryan race, and then again hooks up with the Russians.  Passing as a Nazi, Solly is privy to all the hatred and anger the Nazis had toward the Jews.  He must also assume that stance to exist.I don't want to give away the film to tell more, except that according to my father who fought in WWII, such action actually did occur more often than one might think.  This is the true story of Solomon Perel who, at last telling, was still alive in Israel.Get the film in German, Russian, and Polish with subtitles.

Based on the autobiographical book by Solomon Perel and adapted for the screen by Paul Hengge and director Agnieszka Holland it is a tale of how far a child will go to honor his promise to his father to survive.  Solomon Perel (Marco Hofschneider) is a young Jewish boy when the war breaks out and as the Jews are being gathered for deportation to the camps, his father makes him promise he will do anything to survive.  And survive he does - by adopting the personage of a German Aryan (non-Jew), even to the point of spending days physically trying to reverse his telltale circumcision.  He becomes involved with the Hitler's Youth, adopts the life of a Nazi and, despite a few slips with people who discover his identity, he manages to survive the war.  He not only survives but also falls in love with a perfect German girl Leni (Judy Delphy), excels in the school for Hitler's Youth, and is so popular that even the commandant wants to adopt him. But in time the war is over and he goes to the concentration camps looking for his family.  The measure of despair and joy that happen as he reunites with his brother is one of those memorable moments in time.Marco Hoschneider is exceptional in this film, but much of the success of the movie goes to the director Agnieszka Holland who manages to find juts the right amount of harsh reality and lighten it with moments of human frailty to make the film wholly credible.

It is a great chronicle of WW2 seen from different sides, and it disposes of the myth of racial superiority.This is the story of Solomon Perel, a German Jew boy who survives WW2 by switching sides as his home is overwhelmed by one side or the other.  First he is in Germany, and then sent to Poland.  On September 1st, 1939 Poland is invaded by Germany.  On September 17th, it's invaded by the CCCP.  Perel is trapped under the CCCP side, where, as a boy, he quickly becomes a member of the KOMSOMOL.  This is the communist version of Hitler Youth, and though most people don't realize this or never heard of the KOMSOMOL, the two rganizations are IDENTICAL, each having freaky god-leader fixations on Hitler or Stalin, and being made to indoctrinate young people.He does well as a Komsomol and learns Russian.  Soon, however, in June, 1941, Germany invades Soviet-controlled Poland on its way to invade Russia.  Again Perel has to switch sides, sells himself as an orphaned German gentile, and at the tender age of 13 he hooks up with a German infantry unit as a translator.  He survives the torments of the Eastern Front and is adopted by a Wermacht officer who sends him back to the Fatherland to attend a Nazi Youth academy.Here in the academy, the myth of racial superiority is debunked in a great scene when a nazi doctor in a nazi youth school measures the cranial and facial dimensions of the lead character, Solomon Perel, a German ethnic Jew.  The doctor declare's Perel's face and head match those of a perfect specimen of the aryan race, and if he had blonde hair and blue eyes he would be that perfect specimen.  Perel is also very competitive and often outdoes his aryan friends in both academics and physical competition.This film effectively describes the insanity that swept over Europe in the 40s.  It's engaging and earnest, and if it wasn't for the deus ex machina at the end that didn't happen in real life, I would give it five stars.

But apparently it happened, and this film does an excellent job of depicting the extraordinary story.Solomon Perel was on the eve of his bar mitzvah when his world was shattered.  A pogrom in his German hometown in the late 1930s killed his sister and forced his family to flee to Poland.  There they were once more endangered when Germany invaded Poland in September, 1939.  Solomon is separated from his family, ends up in a Soviet orphanage where he becomes a good Marxist, then through a series of bizarre twists and turns he becomes a hero of the Third Reich and is sent to an elite Hitler Youth school where he's praised as an excellent example of Aryan superiority.Now as a Jewish male Solomon has a major problem keeping the physical evidence of his religion hidden from those who are sworn to exterminate him.  He manages it through a series of coincidences and evasions that are blackly humorous.  Eventually his sense of who he and his family truly are returns, and he begins the long process of re-identifying himself.The film is beautifully presented and manages to give a fuller sense of the horror of the Holocaust much better than many more graphic depictions.",5,A Boy In Search Of Himself,1239062400,"04 7, 2009",2009,1468,"['were', 'not', 'fact', 'real', 'Solomon', 'Perel', 'end', 'Europa', 'Europa', 'would', 'be', 'tempted', 'believe', 'film', 'was', 'fiction', 'too', 'unlikely', 'Jewish', 'boy', 'could', 'survive', 'World', 'War', 'II', 'first', 'good', 'Soviet', 'then', 'good', 'Nazi', 'being', 'discovered', 'apparently', 'happened', 'film', 'excellent', 'job', 'depicting', 'extraordinary', 'story.Solomon', 'Perel', 'was', 'eve', 'bar', 'mitzvah', 'when', 'world', 'was', 'shattered', 'pogrom', 'German', 'hometown', 'late', '1930s', 'killed', 'sister', 'forced', 'family', 'flee', 'Poland', 'were', 'once', 'more', 'endangered', 'when', 'Germany', 'invaded', 'Poland', 'September', '1939', 'Solomon', 'separated', 'family', 'up', 'Soviet', 'orphanage', 'where', 'good', 'Marxist', 'then', 'series', 'bizarre', 'twists', 'hero', 'Third', 'Reich', 'sent', 'elite', 'Hitler', 'Youth', 'school', 'where', 'praised', 'excellent', 'example', 'Aryan', 'superiority.Now', 'Jewish', 'male', 'Solomon', 'major', 'problem', 'keeping', 'physical', 'evidence', 'religion', 'hidden', 'who', 'are', 'sworn', 'exterminate', 'series', 'coincidences', 'evasions', 'are', 'blackly', 'humorous', 'Eventually', 'sense', 'who', 'family', 'truly', 'are', 'returns', 'long', 'process', 're-identifying', 'himself.The', 'film', 'beautifully', 'presented', 'manages', 'give', 'fuller', 'sense', 'horror', 'Holocaust', 'much', 'better', 'many', 'more', 'graphic', 'depictions']",Europa Europa VHS

Initially Solly escapes the German's wearing a Nazi leather coat with the Swastika on the arm, which becomes his first disguise or act in order to survive.

149204,A3O2RCKAMSE9X7,0792842626,Martin Asiner,"[3, 3]","One day in 1939, a Jewish boy's life is turned upside down. His home, his family, his very existence is shattered when the German armies pour into a wide-open Poland.  In EUROPA EUROPA, director Agniewska Holland shows what happens when a state of youthful male innocence collides with the reality of the Nazi whirlwind. The audience sees the war through the eyes of Solomon Perel, a multi-lingual sixteen year old Jewish boy living in Germany.  Marco Hofschneider, who plays Sollie, presents us with the Jewish everyman, one who wishes no more than to be left alone to live his life in peace.  Too young to fight, he is not too young to run.  And this is what he and his brother do. They both leave their home village to seek safety in Poland. They are separated, not to be reconciled until the end of the film, in 1945 in Berlin.  Sollie winds up in a Russian orphanage, where his linguistic abilities allow him to blend in with the other Russian orphans.  It is precisely here that Director Holland pokes a subtle thrust at one of the most controversial methods of Jewish survival during times of anti-semitic pogroms.  Historically, whenever Jews were faced with killing, their choices were limited to one of two: die without fighting back (as did most Jews who wound up in the death camps) or blend in as best they could while denying their essential Jewish identities.  Sollie, with his youthful good looks and fluency in Russian and German, chose the latter.  From the first moments of his flight from Germany, Sollie had to play the ethnic will-o-the-wisp.  What language he spoke, what uniform he wore, what leader he praised, all were a function of who was aiming a gun at his head. Sollie was better at playing the chameleon than most.  In fact, he played the German so well that he was chosen by his Nazi superiors to enroll in the Hitler Jugend, a group that taught him the real meaning of psychological self-debasement.  Throughout the war, Sollie had to change sides several times, each time etching in his soul the increasing need to find some spot of fixed dogma. In one superbly understated scene, Sollie, wearing the uniform of a junior SS cadet, stares morosely through a wind-chilled window and draws with his finger the Jewish star of David, almost as if to remind himself of who he in beneath the gleaming and shiny black leather uniform. By the end of the film, he has come full circle.  Sollie is captured by the Russians in Berlin, who promptly disbelieve his claims that he was forced to leave the sanctity of the Russian orphanage to join the Waffen-SS.  Surprisingly enough, he finds his long lost brother in the ruins of a smoking Berlin, and both survive the war to live in Israel.This film shows the result of how a defenseless people are forced to use assimilation as their only technique for survival.  In Solomon Perel, Agniewshka Holland shows both sides of this coin of survival.  To assimilate, one must play the ethnic and religious chameleon to perfection, but in doing so, one must never forget that this is only an act, and that etching one's symbol of life on a cloudy window may be the only way to do that.",5,Europa Europa: The Fallacy of Assimilation,1023494400,"06 8, 2002",2002,3150,"['One', 'day', '1939', 'Jewish', 'boy', 'life', 'turned', 'upside', 'down', 'home', 'family', 'very', 'existence', 'shattered', 'when', 'German', 'pour', 'wide-open', 'Poland', 'EUROPA', 'EUROPA', 'director', 'Agniewska', 'Holland', 'what', 'when', 'state', 'youthful', 'male', 'innocence', 'collides', 'reality', 'Nazi', 'whirlwind', 'audience', 'war', 'eyes', 'Solomon', 'Perel', 'multi-lingual', 'sixteen', 'year', 'old', 'Jewish', 'boy', 'living', 'Germany', 'Marco', 'Hofschneider', 'who', 'Sollie', 'Jewish', 'everyman', 'one', 'who', 'more', 'be', 'left', 'alone', 'live', 'life', 'peace', 'Too', 'young', 'fight', 'not', 'too', 'young', 'run', 'what', 'brother', 'do', 'leave', 'home', 'village', 'seek', 'safety', 'Poland', 'are', 'separated', 'not', 'be', 'reconciled', 'end', 'film', '1945', 'Berlin', 'Sollie', 'up', 'Russian', 'orphanage', 'where', 'linguistic', 'abilities', 'allow', 'blend', 'other', 'Russian', 'orphans', 'precisely', 'here', 'Director', 'Holland', 'subtle', 'thrust', 'one', 'most', 'controversial', 'methods', 'Jewish', 'survival', 'times', 'anti-semitic', 'pogroms', 'Historically', 'whenever', 'Jews', 'were', 'faced', 'killing', 'choices', 'were', 'limited', 'one', 'two', 'die', 'fighting', 'back', 'did', 'most', 'Jews', 'who', 'wound', 'up', 'death', 'camps', 'blend', 'as', 'best', 'could', 'while', 'denying', 'essential', 'Jewish', 'identities', 'Sollie', 'youthful', 'good', 'looks', 'fluency', 'Russian', 'German', 'chose', 'latter', 'first', 'moments', 'flight', 'Germany', 'Sollie', 'had', 'play', 'ethnic', 'will-o-the-wisp', 'What', 'language', 'spoke', 'what', 'wore', 'what', 'leader', 'praised', 'were', 'function', 'who', 'was', 'aiming', 'gun', 'head', 'Sollie', 'was', 'better', 'playing', 'chameleon', 'most', 'fact', 'played', 'German', 'so', 'well', 'was', 'chosen', 'Nazi', 'superiors', 'enroll', 'Hitler', 'Jugend', 'group', 'taught', 'real', 'meaning', 'psychological', 'self-debasement', 'war', 'Sollie', 'had', 'change', 'sides', 'several', 'times', 'time', 'etching', 'soul', 'increasing', 'need', 'find', 'spot', 'fixed', 'dogma', 'one', 'superbly', 'understated', 'scene', 'Sollie', 'wearing', 'uniform', 'junior', 'SS', 'cadet', 'morosely', 'wind-chilled', 'window', 'draws', 'finger', 'Jewish', 'star', 'David', 'almost', 'remind', 'who', 'beneath', 'gleaming', 'shiny', 'black', 'leather', 'uniform', 'end', 'film', 'come', 'full', 'circle', 'Sollie', 'captured', 'Russians', 'Berlin', 'who', 'promptly', 'disbelieve', 'claims', 'was', 'forced', 'leave', 'sanctity', 'Russian', 'orphanage', 'join', 'Waffen-SS', 'Surprisingly', 'enough', 'long', 'lost', 'brother', 'ruins', 'smoking', 'Berlin', 'survive', 'war', 'live', 'Israel.This', 'film', 'result', 'how', 'defenseless', 'people', 'are', 'forced', 'use', 'assimilation', 'only', 'technique', 'survival', 'Solomon', 'Perel', 'Agniewshka', 'Holland', 'sides', 'coin', 'survival', 'assimilate', 'must', 'play', 'ethnic', 'religious', 'chameleon', 'perfection', 'doing', 'so', 'must', 'never', 'forget', 'only', 'act', 'etching', 'one', 'symbol', 'life', 'cloudy', 'window', 'may', 'be', 'only', 'way', 'do']",Europa Europa VHS
149205,A2E9TRM8096BXU,0792842626,"M. G Watson ""Miles Watson""","[31, 36]","I caught this movie originally on cable a few minutes into the film and was instantly intrigued and completely confused. A Jewish kid in the German Army? And the Hitler Youth? And in love with a German girl who says nice things like 'If there were a Jew here right now, I'd cut his throat!' right before she asks him to father her child. What the hell was going on here?What was going on was 'Europa, Europa', an outstanding and often funny (true) story of a teen of German-Jewish extraction named Jupp who in 1939 was in the Communist Youth League in one of the Soviet-occupied Baltic territories, and ended up being captured by the Germans when they invaded the USSR in 1941. Naturally he concealed his Jewish identity and, believing him to be Volksdeutsch (a non-German of German blood, and therefore automatically a German citizen under Hitler's laws) the Wehrmacht drafted him as a soldier-translator. This begins Jupp's double life....a few months ago he was a Communist and a Jew, and now he's a German and a Nazi....just imagine this kid's confusion. The soldiers of his unit adopt him as a sort of mascot, and even when one of the soldiers discovers his secret, he does not betray him. The mutual affection between Jupp and the soldiers becomes real over time, and leads to Jupp's first crisis of identity: how can he be friends and comrades with men who believe Jews are evil, sub-human scum? Things get even more complicated when the violently anti-Semetic commander of the unit offers to adopt Jupp and send him back to Germany to join a Hitler Youth hostel. Out of the frying pan, into the fire.Jupp finds the Hitler Youth both a dream and a nightmare. On the one hand, much of the Nazi propaganda turns out to be true -- the boys are tough, fun-loving, comradely, and loyal. They enjoy their singing, marching, and sports, and they are truly inspired by the destruction of snobbery and class privelege which was a central objective of National Socialism (Nazism). On the other hand, they sing charming songs like ""sharpen your knives on the paving stone, the Jewish blood will run"" and spend time in class learning to 'spot' Jews and other sub-humans through racial characteristics (Jupp is selected as a good example of Baltic Aryan blood). These kids remind you of darling young tiger cubs that will grow up into man-eaters: they are both charming and frightening.Much of the movie is a black-comic attempt by Jupp to fit in as a loyal German youth while hiding his Jewish identity from his friends, which is tough on account of being circumcised in a society where circumcision was performed only among Jews (there are some lengths Jupp goes to to disguise this fact that will make any man watching EXTREMELY uncomfortable....I kept thinking ""God, that poor kid!""). As you can imagine, when he falls for a lovely Arayan maiden, disguising this fact becomes even harder.As the war roars towards its conclusion, Jupp is torn by the loyalty and sense of belonging he feels in the HJ/Nazi Germany and his true identity. After the defeat at Stalingrad, the mourning boys gather and sing poignantly together as brothers, and Jupp mourns with them. The fact that he is clearly not faking shows the turmoil and conflict in his young heart. Is he Jupp, the Jew, or Jupp, the Nazi?""Europa, Europa"" is different from 'Holocaust' type movies in that it injects a lot of humor into otherwise horrible situations without cheapening what happened. This is an undeniably tragic and moving film; it is also pretty damn funny. But it will also make you mad, and the really infuriating thing for the viewer is the colossal waste of it all -- the movie shows how the egalitarian ideals of National Socialism inspired, moved, and united young people, but was perverted by race hatred, anti-Semetism, and bloodlust, and ulyimately had to be destroyed at a terrible cost to everybody involved. What a stupid, criminal waste of millions of able young men, who were taught to hate people really no different than themselves. What a pity the Germans chose to forget the many Jews who served ably and courageously for their country in World War I, and bought into Hitler's insane hatred of them, a hatred which was not only stupid but hypocritical. After all, the man who in 1917 or so recommended a young Corporal Hitler for his Iron Cross First Class was a lieutnant named Hugo Gutmann....but somehow I'm willing to bet that fact never came up in any Hitler Youth class.

After he learns the Russians have been defeated by the Nazi's, he defects and is discovered by Nazi's who accuse him of being a Jew. He cunningly convinces them that he is actually a German. They believe him and he is quickly embraced by the German army. He then dedicates himself to the causes of the national socialist movement and becomes a member of the Hitler youth. The moments of the film that take place within his participation with the Hilter youth are my favorite moments of the film. During this period in his life the Nazi's proclaim him a war hero. Solomon Perel, as portrayed in the film is someone you almost despise. He hardly seems to be a heroic person by nature, and in fact is easily swayed by the political parties he joins even though he is ultimately hiding the truth that he is a Jew. Obviously he is only doing what he can to survive what ever the cost, even if he betrays his own heroism and his own race of people. There are moments that he is forced to defend his own blood, though he is always one step from being discovered for what he truly is- a Jew. There are many moments of superbly crafted authentism, and the film as a whole deserves a place in history at a minimal level as a classic. On the other hand, what few images of war are present, the film takes a hit because these segments are not very realistic at all and seem amaturish to some degree. But these moments are not what this film is about anyway. A believable look inside the Hitler youth and their brainwashing techniques, and the belief system of comnunism come across nicely in this film.

149212,A1SVXJZ3386U2D,0792842626,Randy Keehn,"[9, 12]","""Europa Europa"" is an unusual movie that caught me a little off guard.  I didn't know whether to take it as an above-average war movie or a unique approach to view multiple perspectives of WWII.  I'm sure the latter was the purpose for the writer and director but I'm still shaking my head at the many twists and turns that our hero had to take.  I won't spoil the movie by trying to tell too much but ""Jupp"" saves himself from the Nazi's by joining them.  The many near misses keep us in suspense and the many different hats that Jupp wears gives us an inside look at the mindsets of the victims and agressors.What challenged me most about ""Europa Europa"" was what to think of Jupp.  Is he a hero or a traitor?  We are given ample evidence to consider.  The movie does a good job of looking at the best and worst of the various groups although it is clear that those blinded by anti-semitism are the bad guys.  However, there were ""good Germans"" that garnered our respect and sympathy (more victims of the Nazis).Jupp got caught up in something he couldn't control despite his guardian angel.  However, as he weaves himself through this amazing maze, we might be excused for wanting him to take a stand and, if only for a brief moment, make a difference.  In essence, for me, the strength of the movie is also its' weakness.

The director, Agnieszka Holland, takes  great license in making this film.  Naturally, though based on a remarkable story, it is hyperbolized to great degree.  Don't let this prohibit you from watching this film.  Being essentially a war movie made by a female director it garners a wide audience through its use of humor, emotion and a little bit of surrealism.Although the film plays like an anime movie in which the most bizarre and coincidental events happen, it only helps to portray the way the adolescent Solomon sees the world. This makes the movie all the more fun.  The mixed emotions and panics and ecstasies that Solomon, the protagonist, feels play in tune with the deception which he uses to survive. I, though far from adolescence, can still remember the drama in the most mundane actives. While I don't want to say that Solomon is a ""Drama Queen"", even he as a character seems to exaggerate his plight at times.When I first saw this movie I was as old as Solomon is supposed to be and I think this could be why I enjoy it so much.  Overall the film is beautifully shot and while it is less than historical it is fun and interesting to watch.  I think in these days when the WWII an the holocaust do not receive enough attention in schools this film is a great medium for introducing to teens (and adults for that matter) the turmoil of central europe during the middle of the last century.

Ironies bite hard and occasional farcical moments add an unsettling edge to Perel's fortunes,e.g. in the class about Aryan racial superiority,when Solly is judged as not pure Aryan,but `Aryan enough'.This shows up racist pseudo-science.He also makes friends where he can,even with Germans who are anti-semitic.Perel is ambivalent towards all these people,Communist or Nazi,his chameleon-like skills bring him among.The film does not evade the horrors,but it alludes to the Holocaust only obliquely.There is no time  to reflect or moments of conscience. Perel's brief but chilling glimpse of the Lodz ghetto is all the grimmer for being set against his picaresque, spirited progress.The real Solly is shown at the end  as he is now in Israel,singing a song.This film covers a lot of history with a light touch.",5,Chameleon of the isms,1275264000,"05 31, 2010",2010,2558,"['Salomon', 'Perel', 'war', 'story', 'more', 'unsettling', 'being', 'true.Directed', 'Polish', 'Jewish', 'director', 'Agnieszka', 'Holland', '1991.Salomon', 'Solly', 'Perel', 'Marco', 'Hofschneider', 'young', 'German', 'Jew', 'father', 'Polish', 'Jewish', 'shop-keeper', 'living', 'Germany', 'family.There', 'Pogrom', 'Jews', 'Kristallnacht', 'Solly', 'brother', 'Isaak', 'flee', 'east', 'Poland.His', 'circumcision', 'shown', 'start', 'film', 'will', 'be', 'defining', 'event', 'identity.Solly', 'split', 'up', 'brother', 'up', 'Russian', 'orphanage', 'Grodno', 'where', 'be', 'fervent', 'young', 'Stalinist', 'infatuated', 'tutor.He', 'model', 'Komsomol', 'speak', 'Russian.He', 'spouts', 'indoctrination', 'Religion', 'opium', ""masses'.With"", 'German', 'invasion', 'Russia', 'school', 'uprooted', 'moves', 'east', 'separated', 'young', 'German', 'German', 'soldiers', 'interpreter', 'who', 'usefully', 'Russian', 'unit', 'known', 'Joseph', 'Jupp', 'Peters', 'favourite', 'German', 'soldiers.His', 'ethnicity', 'known', 'homosexual', 'German', 'soldier', 'secret.He', 'accidental', 'hero', 'unit', 'are', 'killed', 'Russians', 'only', 'find', 'out', 'Russians', 'surrendering', 'German', 'army', 'him.The', 'Commanding', 'officer', 'adopt', 'send', 'son', 'one', 'best', 'German', 'military', 'schools', 'elite', 'youth', 'academy.He', 'lovely', 'Jew-hating', 'Aryan', 'lass', 'Leni', 'Julie', 'Delphy', '.But', 'point', 'effort', 'hiding', 'so', 'many', 'masks', 'not', 'mention', 'hiding', 'most', 'tangible', 'physical', 'evidence', 'identity', 'beginning', 'take', 'toll.The', 'film', 'absurdity', 'adapting', 'changing', 'event', 'yet', 'need', 'survive', 'costs', 'Ironies', 'bite', 'hard', 'occasional', 'farcical', 'moments', 'add', 'unsettling', 'edge', 'Perel', 'fortunes', 'e.g', 'class', 'Aryan', 'racial', 'superiority', 'when', 'Solly', 'judged', 'not', 'pure', 'Aryan', 'Aryan', ""enough'.This"", 'up', 'racist', 'pseudo-science.He', 'also', 'friends', 'where', 'can', 'even', 'Germans', 'who', 'are', 'anti-semitic.Perel', 'ambivalent', 'people', 'Communist', 'Nazi', 'chameleon-like', 'skills', 'bring', 'among.The', 'film', 'not', 'evade', 'horrors', 'Holocaust', 'only', 'obliquely.There', 'time', 'reflect', 'moments', 'conscience', 'Perel', 'brief', 'chilling', 'glimpse', 'Lodz', 'ghetto', 'grimmer', 'being', 'set', 'picaresque', 'spirited', 'progress.The', 'real', 'Solly', 'shown', 'end', 'now', 'Israel', 'singing', 'song.This', 'film', 'lot', 'history', 'light', 'touch']",Europa Europa VHS

Europa Europa is one such unique movie that stays with you long after viewing it. The fact-based story follows the adventures of Jupp [played excellently by Marco Hofschneider] a young Jewish teen who loses members of his family in Nazi occupied Europe, spends some time in a Bolshevik orphanage, and finally ends up amongst the Nazis, masquerading as an Aryan...I could not believe how often Jupp comes close to revealing himself, but always, he is pulled back from disaster in the nick of time. It may seem incredible and almost unbelievable, but if you happen to read true accounts by other Holocaust survivors, you will find that the incredible and miraculous plays a significant role in saving these victims of Nazi propaganda from certain death.
