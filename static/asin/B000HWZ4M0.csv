The guys (ALL of them) were complete idiots for voting off the strong ones too early - bringing about their self-destruction rather than their self-preservation. The women were idiots too - either being too smug (Ami and Leann), too lazy (Eliza and Julie) or too lesbian (Ami and Scout). Twila was the ONLY likeable one in the entire bunch - in the entire show!! Ironically, it was only the two openly lesbian members of the jury (whom I despised) who had the guts to vote for the best in the final two! I hated, hated, hated this season. I love Survivor, but didn't realize how much of a bust it could be until I saw this one.

1017255,A2XAGLR8VDOU6T,B000HWZ4M0,,"[5, 16]","Okay, so technically speaking, Jeff Probst, the venerable host of Survivor, didn't walk away with the check for a million dollars at the end of Survivor Vanuatu, the show's ninth season. That honor belongs to Chris Daugherty, the highway construction worker who survived a female alliance and fought his way to victory.However, Probst really could be considered the winner of this season, much like Boston Rob could've been considered the winner of the All-Star season. Probst found something bigger than money, he found Julie Berry. And I am sure he is not the only one that would take Julie over a check for a million dollars.Berry was the youth mentor from Maine who eventually finished fifth in this season, but her and Probst have since struck up a relationship, one that he felt brewing while the season was being filmed. In a commentary track on the finale, Probst revealed that he thought she was the most beautiful girl he  had ever seen when she walked into her audition before the show even started. And quite honestly, he's right. She ranks up there with Colleen Haskell, Amber Brkich Mariano and Elisabeth Filarski as one of the most beautiful women to play the game of Survivor.While Probst was busy picking up a girlfriend, Daugherty was busy scheming and lying his way to a million dollars. He sure didn't get off to a good start, making his final victory even more implausible.The teams arrived on Vanuatu and were divided into tribes of men and women by the natives. In the very first challenge, with immunity on the line, Daugherty couldn't fight his way across a balance beam and cost his team the win. Despite that, he wasn't sent home, as he teamed with drill sargent Lea Masters (Sarge), Travis (Bubba) Sampson, Rory Freeman and Chad Critttenden to form the ""Fat Five"" (although it should be noted, Chad was far from fat). The five older guys stuck together and voted off three younger guys before the game was switched up.The guys eventually rebounded and were able to capture a few wins, while the girls managed to stick together. Only Dolly Neely, the adorable sheep farmer and Mia the incredibly annoying one, were sent home early. The women's alliance was led by Ami Cusack and Leann Slaby. The two had a tight bond and they helped unite the other women.But, change came when the two teams were split, with Julie and Twila Tanner, the outspoken, hard-working highway repair worker, joining the male Lopevi tribe and Bubba and Rory joining the female Yasur tribe. The new Lopevi started strong and Bubba was sent home. The new Lopevi women teamed up with the guys to vote off John Kenney, despite his strength in challenges, and the women agreed to vote off Lisa before Rory, as she had made a comment that didn't sit well with Ami, who seemingly controlled the game in Yasur.When the merge came along, the men were outnumbered, as Rory, Chris, Sarge and Chad were only four to Julie, Eliza Orlins, Twila, Ami, Leann and Scout Cloud Lee, the oldest of the Vanuatu contestants. Rory, Sarge and Chad, who was a dynamite competitor despite the fact that he had an artificial leg, were voted off by the women's alliance, leaving Chris up against six women.And that is when the game took one of its most dramatic turns. When the women decided they wanted to vote out Eliza before Chris, the lone male teamed with Twila, Scout and Eliza to turn the table and Leann went home, shocking Ami and Julie. Twila made perhaps her biggest mistake, swearing on her son that  she was with Leann and Ami, a lie that a few contestants took very seriously.With the game changed around, Ami went home next, followed by Julie, then Eliza, with Scout the final person voted out. In the final tribal council, Twila's lies and her outspoken ways came back to bite her, while Chris' lies didn't seem to bother anyone and the lone male in the final seven pulled out the big win.Of course the only reason to buy reality shows on DVD is for extras and this set had a good amount of things. There were four commentary tracks. Chad, Chris, Twila, Scout, Eliza, Julie and Ami all sat in on at least two sessions, while Jeff Probst joined in on the finale. These commentaries were very interesting and are really what helps to sell this set. There were also four featurettes, one on each disc, involving the same castaways as the commentaries. These were also informative for a Survivor fan.Though I was happy to see this release, I was a little surprised. Airing after the All-Stars version, this season was not considered one of the best in Survivor history, so I was surprised when it appeared on the DVD schedule. It's disappointing that we haven't seen seasons three through six, including Africa and the Amazon, but any release of this show is a good one if they keep up the solid extras.",5,And the winner

1017256,A3BH8VUDIJJXNO,B000HWZ4M0,"abbaselena ""Paul""","[6, 12]","When I first viewed this season I thought it was fairly poor compared to the other seasons, but after viewing it again it is much better the second time around! The season kicks off with 18 castaways stranded in the middle on an active volcanic island in the South Pacific. The two tribes Lopevi (red) and Yasur (yellow) are divided into men and women. Alliances are formed by age differences in both tribes when Brook & Dolly are the first two gone. Then in a game twist both tribes are sent to tribal council & John K wins immunity and is safe from tribal. John P and Mia are the two gome in the episode. the older men continue to show they have the numbers when brady is voted out. In a second twist, the two tribes have a tribal switch after an earthquake rocks the island, bubba is then voted out. Then Lisa is sent packing when she makes a comment to Ami. Then John K is ousted days before the merge. In the next episode the two tribes merge to form Alinta (orange) when Julie and Twila abondon the men to vote Rory out. The women continue to dominate when Sarge & Chad are eliminated. Chris is the last man standing but manages to get Scout, Twila and Eliza an his side blinsiding LeAnn, Twila is after accused of swearing on her sons life and going back on it. The four then continue to eliminate Ami then Julie. In the final four, Chris chooses to go with Twila when Eliza is ousted. When Chris wins final immunity, he votes Scout out. In an emotional final tribal council Chris becomes the sole survivor beating Twila 5-2.I would not say this to be the best season, however a great one! It's funny to watch the women fall apart when they have the game wrapped up, Chris is definitely one of the best strategic players to ever play the game.I do wish the dvd had more special features, but the commentary is funny because Julie always talks about Jeff when he appears (Jeff Probst & Julie Berrie are dating).

There is nothing wrong with these dvds, it is a nice collection with nice production values.  But if you haven't seen this season, you might want to think twice before purchasing it.Here is my problem with it (excuse the rant).  Survivor used to be about people surviving in the wilderness.  They endured hardships, were challenged each week to do physical and mental challenges, and people who were good at these things were rewarded.  Not anymore.  The game now caters to the lowest common denominator.  The people who are the strongest, or smartest, or have the best survival skills are always the ones to get voted out first.  They are ""too much of a threat"" to everyone else who realizes that they are not as skilled.  The challenges too are a big joke.  For example, several of the challenges essentially revolved around ""walking across a balance beam"".  Hmm, now what in the world does that have to do with survival skills?  By the time you get to the end of this sorry affair, you're left with all least skilled, least interesting, meanest, nastiest people that you just don't give a damn about.

1017266,A3MDEYI0URIF50,B000HWZ4M0,James Cunningham,"[6, 12]","I would definitely say this is Survivors worst season.  The problem lies in premise of men vs. woman, which had just been done in Amazon, and I was hoping would never be done again since it was boring the first time.  In Vanuatu it was even worse, since woman, in my opinion, seem to play survivor as a battle of the sexes anyways.  There is no reason to encourage it by starting the game that way.  Add to that, 2 of the woman are lesbians who dont want any part of the men anyways, and you have a recipe for boredom,  which is exactly what this season cooked up.The ""exotic"" location seemed dull and boring, with the exception of the eruption/ earthquake that was cool.  Another problem is just in the players themselves, most were annoying, and all the likeable characters were soon eliminated.  The one shining star, in my opinion was Rory(sp) who started of annoying and then let lose and captured the game for several episodes.  Unfortunately, due to the position he was in he was doomed, and was soon voted out.

Twila annoyed me so much I'm mad she made the final 2!! Ok now about the season. At first the Men and the Women were split up into tribes so it was Men vs. Women. And throughout the season the Women seemed to dominate! Up until te final 6, there was Ami, Twila, Eliza, Scout, and Julie. But there was Chris for the men. But Chris battled back and won immunity a couple of times. So he helped vote out Ami, Julie, and Eliza. So then it came down to the final 3, Scout, Chris, and Twila. Chris won final immunity. He voted out Scout. Now it is only Twila and Chris. The winner was Chris! The men had come back and beat the women! All the challenges were great, 2 people had nicknames. Travis was ""Bubba"" and Lee was ""Sarge"". And about the 6th episode, the tribes were mixed up. O yeah, in that episode there was an earthquake!! It was an awesome eathquake.

Friendships, alliances, rivalries and fights to stay, all kept me interested.The cast was very interesting to view, everyone got roughly the same air time (minus about 3 of them) and all of it was deserved and showed their development. Also a few people I despised when I first viewed the season I grew to enjoy (Twila being the main example).Even knowing the results, the fun didn't let up and the merge was very fun to watch with quite a few twists to the game appearing there.

1017275,A2Z6Z7Q7519QCK,B000HWZ4M0,Sammy Moore,"[1, 4]","Survivor: Vanuatu is the second season of Survivor that I watched in full, the first being Pearl Islands. I skipped All Stars because I found it difficult to enjoy without knowing who the cast were.Vanuatu is the battle of the sexes - men vs women. Survivor had previously tried to have a battle of the sexes season in Amazon, but the attempt failed due to casting too many flirty, attractive young people. Vanuatu succeeded because the attractive young men were all booted immediately, and the women were not at all flirty, and the female tribe was stacked with girl power. Needless to say, this is what Amazon should have been.SPOILERS BEYOND THIS POINTWhat I really liked about this season was how the storyline plays out - it almost feels like a scripted drama at times.As a man, I was of course rooting for Lopevi throughout the season (I hate to admit, I actually bought a Lopevi buff from CBS's online store). The challenges seemed very catered toward the women - two of the early challenges involved balance beams, and no challenges relied solely on brute strength. Needless to say, the men aren't looking too good...The merge happens with 4 men and 6 women, but the men have allied with Julie and Twila so they feel that they will be safe. Julie and Twila betray the men, voting out Rory and Sarge. When Sarge is voted out, Chris promises that he will win the season and burn all of the women who betrayed him and his friends. From this point, the season turns into the Chris show. Chris weasels his way into an alliance with Twila, Scout, and Eliza and makes sure to stab everybody in the back who voted out his friends. But what really makes Chris a great character is that he betrays his two closest female friends - Eliza and Julie - for no reason. He just saw them as the enemy, and wanted revenge for Sarge, Chad, and Rory.The season is an epic. It has an amazing storyline, and it is one of the few seasons of Survivor that I enjoy watching even after multiple viewings.My only complaint about the DVD is that I would have liked commentary for every episode, but that's not a big deal.",5,An underrated season that plays out like an epic.,1244678400,"06 11, 2009",2009,2101,"['Survivor', 'Vanuatu', 'second', 'season', 'Survivor', 'watched', 'full', 'first', 'being', 'Pearl', 'Islands', 'skipped', 'Stars', 'found', 'difficult', 'enjoy', 'knowing', 'who', 'cast', 'were.Vanuatu', 'battle', 'sexes', 'men', 'vs', 'women', 'Survivor', 'had', 'previously', 'tried', 'have', 'battle', 'sexes', 'season', 'Amazon', 'attempt', 'failed', 'due', 'casting', 'too', 'many', 'flirty', 'attractive', 'young', 'people', 'Vanuatu', 'succeeded', 'attractive', 'young', 'men', 'were', 'booted', 'immediately', 'women', 'were', 'not', 'flirty', 'female', 'tribe', 'was', 'stacked', 'girl', 'power', 'Needless', 'say', 'what', 'Amazon', 'should', 'have', 'been.SPOILERS', 'BEYOND', 'THIS', 'POINTWhat', 'really', 'liked', 'season', 'was', 'how', 'storyline', 'out', 'almost', 'feels', 'scripted', 'drama', 'man', 'was', 'course', 'rooting', 'Lopevi', 'season', 'hate', 'admit', 'actually', 'bought', 'Lopevi', 'buff', 'CBS', 'online', 'store', 'challenges', 'seemed', 'very', 'catered', 'women', 'two', 'early', 'challenges', 'involved', 'balance', 'beams', 'challenges', 'relied', 'solely', 'brute', 'strength', 'Needless', 'say', 'men', 'are', ""n't"", 'looking', 'too', 'good', 'merge', '4', 'men', '6', 'women', 'men', 'have', 'allied', 'Julie', 'Twila', 'feel', 'will', 'be', 'safe', 'Julie', 'Twila', 'betray', 'men', 'voting', 'out', 'Rory', 'Sarge', 'When', 'Sarge', 'voted', 'out', 'Chris', 'will', 'win', 'season', 'burn', 'women', 'who', 'betrayed', 'friends', 'point', 'season', 'Chris', 'show', 'Chris', 'weasels', 'way', 'alliance', 'Twila', 'Scout', 'Eliza', 'sure', 'stab', 'everybody', 'back', 'who', 'voted', 'out', 'friends', 'what', 'really', 'Chris', 'great', 'character', 'two', 'closest', 'female', 'friends', 'Eliza', 'Julie', 'reason', 'just', 'saw', 'enemy', 'wanted', 'revenge', 'Sarge', 'Chad', 'Rory.The', 'season', 'epic', 'amazing', 'storyline', 'one', 'few', 'seasons', 'Survivor', 'enjoy', 'watching', 'even', 'multiple', 'viewings.My', 'only', 'complaint', 'DVD', 'would', 'have', 'liked', 'commentary', 'episode', 'not', 'big', 'deal']",Survivor Vanuatu - The Complete Season

I recall seeing the previews for the first season and was immediately intrigued.  Although I have not seen every season since, I have seen almost all of them.After the conclusion of the last season on tv.  I decided I would buy a DVD set.  I picked  Vanuatu, which I watched the original airing of, but  I did not recall who won. I did recall that  one of the tribe received an extra clothing in an unusual way and thought that was pretty cool. Unfortunately, having read several reviews here on Amazon a few decided to give away the ending.  THANKS ALOT!I still like watching it quite a bit and usually sit down and watch two or three episodes back to back.  It is fun to watch the challenges and personal hustling over votes the tribe members do with each other. I had hoped there would be some extra footage thrown in but this is just the original episode.  Yes there are some extra features, but I would have preferred to see them integrated into a seamless episode.Which brings up a interesting point.  That is the editors who put the show together.  They could just show all the scheming among members so that you would more or less know the outcome of the vote beforehand.  But they choose the footage to show so that you get an idea of what is going on but are not always sure of the outcome.  And that is one of the things that makes the series so great.
