A Solinas ""ea_solinas""","[0, 0]","If you had to describe ""North and South,"" it would probably be something like ""Jane Austen with more sociopolitical content.""But not quite enough of that goes into the 1975 miniseries based on Elizabeth Gaskell's underrated novel about love and worker unions just after the Industrial Revolution. A pre-stardom Patrick Stewart makes a powerful and scene-stealing Mr. Thornton, with his booming voice and strong features, but Rosalie Shanks gives a relatively pallid and artificial performance as the main character.After a decade living in London, Margaret Hale (Shanks) returns to the idyllic country village of Helstone to live with her parents. But then her father (Robin Bailey) declares that he is leaving the Church of England out of vague religious scruples, and is instead becoming a classical tutor. Unfortunately for Margaret, this means moving to the dirty, hardscrabble northern town of Milton, which contains several mills and manufacturing businesses.Her father's first pupil is Mr. Thornton, who worked his way up out of poverty through brains and hard work, and now owns a cotton mill. Margaret soon makes a friend (Barbara Hickmott) who is dying because of poor conditions at the mill. So she blames Thornton, believing he's unfair and harsh to his workers.And she's not the only one -- the dissatisfied workers of Milton have begun to rebel against their employers, forming a union and going on strike. Thornton finds himself in the middle of the conflict, even as Margaret struggles to help her ailing mother -- and despite being on different sides of the increasingly heated conflict, the two of them begin to fall in love. But misunderstandings, class differences and tragedy stand in their way.""North and South"" is neither an excellent adaptation, nor a bad one. Instead it lies in that bland middle-of-the-road place where it's mildly amusing to watch, but only a few things really stick in your mind. It's best enjoyed for the lovely period costumes and the whole subplot about Thornton gradually learning to be more kind to his workers, even to the detriment of his business.What sets this story apart from other period romances is the whole plot about the workers and industrialists. It takes place after the flowering of the Industrial Revolution, when labor in mills and factories was cheap and dangerous, and there were no laws or safety regulations to protect people. It would be easy to just demonize the big nouveau riche guys like Thornton, but there is a genuine effort to show both sides of the conflict -- neither side is all nobility or all villainy. There are no easy answers.And woven in are some important subplots, such as Mrs. Hale's slow fatal illness (implied to be caused or exacerbated by the industrial smog) and Margaret's exiled brother sneaking into the country so he can visit her. But the most important part is both Thornton and Margaret learning to overcome their prejudices and class differences, becoming better people before they can fall in love.The biggest problem is Rosalie Shanks. While her performance isn't terrible, she doesn't have any of the fire or verve that you would expect from a young woman of such strong opinions. And she plays Margaret with such simpering artificiality that it's difficult to lose yourself in the story, because you keep waiting for her to express a real emotion.On the other hand, it's easy to see who in this cast would become the big, famous actor. Patrick Stewart wasn't yet a star when he made this miniseries, but every scene he's in is simply filled with his presence -- his rich Shakespearean voice given a more lower-class accent and staccato rhythm. And there are some solid supporting performances by Bailey, Hickmott, Kathleen Byron, Rosalie Crutchley and especially Norman Jones as a passionate, iconoclastic unionist.""North and South"" is an adaptation that doesn't quite do justice to Elizabeth Gaskell's exquisite novel, mostly because the female lead is embarrassing to watch. But watch it for Patrick Stewart and the solid story about unions and industrial workers.",3,South meets North,1401840000,"06 4, 2014",2014,4075,"['had', 'describe', 'North', 'South', 'would', 'probably', 'be', 'something', 'Jane', 'Austen', 'more', 'sociopolitical', 'content', 'not', 'quite', 'enough', '1975', 'miniseries', 'based', 'Elizabeth', 'Gaskell', 'underrated', 'novel', 'love', 'worker', 'unions', 'just', 'Industrial', 'Revolution', 'pre-stardom', 'Patrick', 'Stewart', 'powerful', 'scene-stealing', 'Mr.', 'Thornton', 'booming', 'voice', 'strong', 'features', 'Rosalie', 'Shanks', 'relatively', 'pallid', 'artificial', 'performance', 'main', 'character.After', 'decade', 'living', 'London', 'Margaret', 'Hale', 'Shanks', 'idyllic', 'country', 'village', 'Helstone', 'live', 'parents', 'then', 'father', 'Robin', 'Bailey', 'leaving', 'Church', 'England', 'vague', 'religious', 'scruples', 'instead', 'becoming', 'classical', 'tutor', 'Unfortunately', 'Margaret', 'moving', 'dirty', 'hardscrabble', 'northern', 'town', 'Milton', 'several', 'mills', 'manufacturing', 'businesses.Her', 'father', 'first', 'pupil', 'Mr.', 'Thornton', 'who', 'worked', 'way', 'poverty', 'brains', 'hard', 'work', 'now', 'cotton', 'mill', 'Margaret', 'soon', 'friend', 'Barbara', 'Hickmott', 'who', 'dying', 'poor', 'conditions', 'mill', 'Thornton', 'believing', 'unfair', 'harsh', 'workers.And', 'not', 'only', 'one', 'dissatisfied', 'workers', 'Milton', 'have', 'begun', 'rebel', 'employers', 'forming', 'union', 'going', 'strike', 'Thornton', 'middle', 'conflict', 'even', 'Margaret', 'help', 'ailing', 'mother', 'being', 'different', 'sides', 'increasingly', 'heated', 'conflict', 'two', 'begin', 'fall', 'love', 'misunderstandings', 'class', 'differences', 'tragedy', 'stand', 'way', 'North', 'South', 'excellent', 'adaptation', 'bad', 'one', 'Instead', 'bland', 'middle-of-the-road', 'place', 'where', 'mildly', 'amusing', 'watch', 'only', 'few', 'things', 'really', 'stick', 'mind', 'best', 'enjoyed', 'lovely', 'period', 'costumes', 'whole', 'subplot', 'Thornton', 'gradually', 'learning', 'be', 'more', 'kind', 'workers', 'even', 'detriment', 'story', 'apart', 'other', 'period', 'romances', 'whole', 'plot', 'workers', 'industrialists', 'place', 'flowering', 'Industrial', 'Revolution', 'when', 'labor', 'mills', 'factories', 'was', 'cheap', 'dangerous', 'were', 'laws', 'safety', 'regulations', 'protect', 'people', 'would', 'be', 'easy', 'just', 'demonize', 'big', 'nouveau', 'riche', 'guys', 'Thornton', 'genuine', 'effort', 'show', 'sides', 'conflict', 'side', 'nobility', 'villainy', 'are', 'easy', 'answers.And', 'woven', 'are', 'important', 'subplots', 'such', 'Mrs.', 'Hale', 'slow', 'fatal', 'illness', 'implied', 'be', 'caused', 'exacerbated', 'industrial', 'smog', 'Margaret', 'exiled', 'brother', 'sneaking', 'country', 'can', 'visit', 'most', 'important', 'part', 'Thornton', 'Margaret', 'learning', 'overcome', 'prejudices', 'class', 'differences', 'becoming', 'better', 'people', 'can', 'fall', 'love.The', 'biggest', 'problem', 'Rosalie', 'Shanks', 'performance', ""n't"", 'terrible', ""n't"", 'have', 'fire', 'verve', 'would', 'expect', 'young', 'woman', 'such', 'strong', 'opinions', 'Margaret', 'such', 'simpering', 'artificiality', 'difficult', 'lose', 'story', 'keep', 'waiting', 'express', 'real', 'emotion.On', 'other', 'hand', 'easy', 'see', 'who', 'cast', 'would', 'become', 'big', 'famous', 'actor', 'Patrick', 'Stewart', 'was', ""n't"", 'yet', 'star', 'when', 'made', 'miniseries', 'scene', 'simply', 'filled', 'presence', 'rich', 'Shakespearean', 'voice', 'given', 'more', 'lower-class', 'accent', 'staccato', 'rhythm', 'are', 'solid', 'supporting', 'performances', 'Bailey', 'Hickmott', 'Kathleen', 'Byron', 'Rosalie', 'Crutchley', 'especially', 'Norman', 'Jones', 'passionate', 'iconoclastic', 'unionist', 'North', 'South', 'adaptation', ""n't"", 'quite', 'do', 'justice', 'Elizabeth', 'Gaskell', 'exquisite', 'novel', 'mostly', 'female', 'lead', 'embarrassing', 'watch', 'watch', 'Patrick', 'Stewart', 'solid', 'story', 'unions', 'industrial', 'workers']",NORTH & SOUTH
1646145,A1B86SJOKGAZ3B,B00CEBJC20,"E. Sadowski ""marine sis""","[9, 11]","First off, I want to mention that I was first introduced to ""North & South"" when a friend lent me her Elizabeth Gaskell Collection and I fell in love with the 2004 mini series and then immediately read the book twice afterwards. I fell even more in love with the book with its rich details and very human characters so then my disappointment with some aspects of the mini series was deeply felt. Now, I was fortunate to get this 1975 BBC production a few days earlier than its release date and I am glad to have purchased it.As a previous reviewer has mentioned this 70s production with Patrick Stewart and Rosalind Shanks does focus a bit more on scenes that were either totally omitted from the 2004 mini series or flat out skimmed over. As one may know this story is about a former Anglican minister who left the church from his idyllic country parish in the rich South and usurped his family to the North where he is to become tutor in a dirty manufacturing town called, Milton, where some manufacturers want to obtain a better education. A key student is John Thornton who falls in love with Mr. Hale's daughter, Margaret, but Margaret herself is subject to prejudice and misunderstanding towards any tradespeople. It is really Margaret Hale's story about her maturing to a better person especially when tragedies enter her life. Actually, ""North & South"" is a cross between Charles Dickens and Jane Austen.SPOILER ALERT! One of the best scenes is the focus between Mr. Hale and his daughter when he explains why he is leaving the ministry even reading a passage from a book which is also in Elizabeth Gaskell's story. In addition, the ending is far more in line with Gaskell's taking place in London but the ending isn't quite faithful to Elizabeth's although to me it is far more romantic than 2004's version. However, some of the lines are a direct quote from the original story.Yes, the quality of this 1975 serial is pretty good in both quality and sound. Even the outdoor scenes are a little better than other productions from early BBC but nothing really to totally wow anyone. Yet, my point is that it is relatively clean and easy to watch. There is even a warning stating that due to the age of the serial all the anomalies were not successfully taken out. I suppose that this refers to tiny green spots that are found in a few spots but not lasting more than a few seconds. Yes, there are subtitles for those in need of them.SOME MORE SPOILER ALERTS! Having said the above, I did feel that this serial from early BBC felt a bit rushed to me. I know that due to a tight budget restraint some crucial scenes had to be cut. For instance, the part where Frederick and Margaret meet Leonards at the train station had been cut. That is, Leonards was never in the scene so it changes the feel of that scene to me although Thornton was there to see Margaret and Fred embrace. Also, some scenes were added which never existed. When the strikers break down the door to Marlborough Mills instead of the mother and daughter being in the back of the house they are in the same living room where John and Margaret are and overhear Miss Hale urging John to speak with the workers and hear what she says back to them. That sort of spoiled that moment although when Margaret was hit by a rock John does repeat some agonized lines directly from the book. ""North & South"" fans will squeal with delight or at least some who know the lines I'm talking about!:-)All in all, if you are a fan of BBC or Elizabeth Gaskell's works I urge you to at least rent before buying. Some might be very disappointed and some might learn to like it.

1646146,AO1Z0TQWCRGL4,B00CEBJC20,"Harold Wolf ""Doc""","[20, 23]","This 1975 adaptation feels more realistic compared to the 2004 series.  Both are recommended Victorian romantic viewing. Each offers its own interpretation and lingers on different portions of the book by Elizabeth Gaskell. The Hale family spends a bit more of the opening episode in London and England's southern countryside during this DVDs presentation. Thus the comparison of North & South is a bit more complete. Of course, here viewers also get an early look at the acting career of a huge film star in Patrick Stewart. He quickly moved on to ""I, Claudius"" and then, of course, the Captain of ""Star Trek"", among many. Also, film star Tim Pigott-Smith played the Hale son in 1975, early in his career, and went on to play the clergyman father in the 2004 version and even a later part in ""Downton Abbey.""This DVD set seems to hold a classic-like visual effect, having been done in a period of time when the BBC was excelling at converting fine literature into TV serials, as they were called then. Period costume drama never goes out of style.SDH SUBTITLES have been added to all 4 episodes.1- The love story unfolds in the countryside bliss of serene Victorian bliss. Margaret Hale (Rosalie Shanks), at age 19, hopes to commune with the common locals. Her Papa, clergyman Hale (Robin Bailey), determines to resign from the church. The Hales move in a fortnight to the industrial, dirty, Milton of the north. He'll serve as a private tutor to cotton-spinners. There they quickly meet the 1st pupil, Mr. J. Thornton (Stewart), a textile manufacturer.2- A mill strike places workers, including the Higgins family in a desperate situation. Nicholas Higgins (Norman Jones- `South Riding') is a union man, against violence and lawlessness. Thornton intends to break the strike and union. Illness hits the Hale house, and maid Dixon (Peggy Ann Wood- ""Lillie"") must step somewhat aside.3- A Margaret & Thornton encounter shakes them both. Frederick, Margaret's brother, is summoned due to his mother's (Rosalie Crutchley) health situation. But what of the legal charges?4- Former union man Higgins meets with boss Thornton to ask for work. Margaret receives bad news. Life at Milton seems to be failing for many.",5,E.

1646150,A2VOAWWUS5860I,B00CEBJC20,L. Sheppard,"[9, 9]","First off, let me just say that it is nice to read such glowing reviews for this earlier production. I am glad so many enjoy it!  I too found gems that I enjoyed, yet I must be honest in saying that I struggle with more, for I did not find it 'more accurate to the book', as so many proclaim.The '04 adaptation will always hold a special place in my heart, for it was through this production that I found N&S; and Elizabeth Gaskell.  Still.. that being said, you can't adore Gaskell's work without acknowledging issues that are present.  The '04 production team took liberties and made changes they felt were necessary to making the story more appealing to modern audiences.  Determining whether they were correct in making these changes largely depends on each viewer.I do believe that this same consideration needs to be given to this production ('75) as well. Yet saying that this earlier interpretation follows more closely to the book is overstated.  Yes this production includes more direct lines and some settings of the scenes appear more accurate, yet it also took liberties and had some troubling omissions, as well.  Omissions of events that prove essential to the shaping and forward development of our heroine and even our hero.As to the characterizations, I found them lacking as well. Rosalind Shanks comes off much to old for Margaret, who at the opening of the story is an idealistic 18 year old.  I did like that Rosalind portrays the more demure side of Margaret's character but she fails to show the intelligent spirited side. Margaret is a beautifully weaved character with both independent and self sacrificial traits. A friend describes this portrayal of Margaret in this fashion, ""I kept waiting for Margaret to awaken from her sleeping beauty haze.""Patrick Stewart is a talented classical actor with a strong theatrical flare.  He brought this theatrical style to his portrayal of Thornton. It is this style that I struggle with the most.  Much of the time, Stewart portrays Thornton's passion in bellowing and barking tones.  Neither of which is consistent to the strong but gentle way Thornton spoke in the book. The '04 production is often criticized for it's blatant mischaracterization of Thornton's temper, and rightfully so.  Yet in this production, Thornton's characterization is equally flawed.  Though it's delivered in more subtle ways, Thornton is still portrayed with a short and sharp temper. This temper is thrust at Mr. Hale, Margaret, Higgins and even his own mother.  And I wont even get into the mischaracterization of Hannah.  All in all, I felt that all the actors struggle to portray the heart of their characters.  Did Margaret actually fall in love with Thornton? It's hard to tell.  Did Thornton love Margaret with every fiber of his being?  Was he heartbroken when she left Milton for London?  If so, there is little indication.There has also been praise for the inclusion of several scenes, missing from the later adaptation. Yet even with these inclusions there were hefty changes that make little sense. This includes the ending scene.  Though the setting is properly situated in a London drawing room, the heart and soul of the exquisite ending Gaskell conveyed was either completely changed or poorly delivered. It lacked the powerful under currant of passion between these two characters. The emotion is either not there at all or completely unbelievable!Still in conclusion, as I stated above I can also honestly say that there are a few enjoyable moments in this production.

Based on the novel by Elizabeth Gaskell, North & South gives you a look at how society clashed as the modern world fought for dominance in Victorian society.  Margaret and her father move to the county to tutor the commoners and there she meets the dashing textile worker who wins her heart. When a strike breaks out the two find themselves on opposing sides of the union.  Patrick Stewart does a phenomenal job in this early role that helped kick off his career. The costumes and setting are beautiful and realistic.
