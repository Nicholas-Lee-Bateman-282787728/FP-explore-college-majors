759127,A3DGB4HN3QCGAL,B00009X75H,A. Burchfield,"[2, 3]","I've always liked Stargate, 4th season is no exception although I did think it might be just a lilttle darker in tone at times. The writers/ producers continue to come up with a wide variety of plots, writing, great sets and some interesting characters.The most unusual set was in the season opener &quot;Small Victories&quot; in which O'Neill and Teal'c do battle with the Replicators on board a Russian submarine, it really is a Russian submarine.I thought one of the most unusual characters was that of the Goa'uld Osiris, portrayed by Anna-Louise Plowman (the best role I've seen her in). In this one a former colleague of Daniel Jackson's, Sarah Gardner, is finally revealed to have been posessed by the Osiris symbiote after examining some Egyptian artifacts at their University. Plowman does that role so well, its a shame we don't see her more often. You always have Richard Dean Anderson doing his oddball bit, the best guest oddball was Willie Garson in &quot;Point of no Return&quot;, playing the part of a delusional little guy who thinks he's an alien, turns out he is. That story was fun but definitely not one of the more serious episodes of the season.",4,Good television 4 years running,1074643200,"01 21, 2004",2004,1168,"[""'ve"", 'always', 'liked', 'Stargate', '4th', 'season', 'exception', 'did', 'think', 'might', 'be', 'just', 'lilttle', 'darker', 'tone', 'times', 'writers/', 'producers', 'continue', 'come', 'up', 'wide', 'variety', 'plots', 'writing', 'great', 'sets', 'interesting', 'characters.The', 'most', 'unusual', 'set', 'was', 'season', 'opener', 'quot', 'Small', 'Victories', 'quot', ""O'Neill"", 'Teal', 'c', 'do', 'battle', 'Replicators', 'board', 'Russian', 'submarine', 'really', 'Russian', 'submarine.I', 'thought', 'one', 'most', 'unusual', 'characters', 'was', ""Goa'uld"", 'Osiris', 'portrayed', 'Anna-Louise', 'Plowman', 'best', 'role', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'one', 'former', 'colleague', 'Daniel', 'Jackson', 'Sarah', 'Gardner', 'finally', 'revealed', 'have', 'been', 'posessed', 'Osiris', 'symbiote', 'examining', 'Egyptian', 'artifacts', 'University', 'Plowman', 'role', 'so', 'well', 'shame', 'do', ""n't"", 'see', 'more', 'often', 'always', 'have', 'Richard', 'Dean', 'Anderson', 'doing', 'oddball', 'bit', 'best', 'guest', 'oddball', 'was', 'Willie', 'Garson', 'quot', 'Point', 'Return', 'quot', 'playing', 'part', 'delusional', 'little', 'guy', 'who', 'alien', 'out', 'story', 'was', 'fun', 'definitely', 'not', 'one', 'more', 'serious', 'episodes', 'season']",N/A

759129,ABSX5TGEGRH76,B00009X75H,"Andrew ""Radaar""","[3, 3]","The Replicators.  The Russians.  The Aschen.  These are only a few of the new enemies presented this year, in Stargate: SG-1 (okay, so technically, the Replicators were introduced last year).  These new baddies made a lot of trouble this year for the SGC in what is definitely the best season yet.  We learn more about the Replicators this year when Sam (Amanda Tapping) is brought to an Asgard-controlled planet to help defend the O'Neill, the Asgard's newest and most advanced ship ever.  Also, the Russians retrieve the Giza gate from the bottom of the ocean from when Thor's ship, the Beliskner, crashed, while the SGC is now using the Antarctica gate.  And, 10 years in the future, an advanced race, known as the Aschen, are quietly wiping out the human race by making humans infertile.These are just a handful of the amazing new stories that occurred this year.  It seems that Col. O'Neill (Richard Dean Anderson), Maj. Carter, Dr. Jackson (Michael Shanks), and Teal'c (Christopher Judge) can never catch a break.  This year, not only have their alien enemies become more powerful than ever, especially Apophis (Peter Williams), their enemies on Earth have truly become a threat.  Senator Kinsey (Ronny Cox), the man who tried to shut down the SGC in Season 1, has been linked to the rogue sector of the NID, the civillian organization responsible for the theft of numerous alien technologies over the last few years.The stories this year are better than ever, especially with an increasing number of arcs occurring.  Episodes like &quot;Crossroads&quot; and &quot;The Serpent's Venom&quot; were expertly executed, and had immense emotional effects on our heroes.  However, I have to praise the stand-alones this year, especially &quot;Window of Opportunity&quot; and &quot;The Other Side&quot;, which have never been better.I guess the only thing that I didn't like about this season is that the Asgard were only in one episode, and the Tollan and the Nox were nowhere to be found.  Oh well.If you have seen the previous three seasons and are still skeptical about this show, I urge you to watch Season 4; I guarantee your interest in this show will quickly increase.Some other great episodes are:&quot;Small Victories&quot;, &quot;Upgrades&quot;, &quot;Watergate&quot;, &quot;Point of No Return&quot;, &quot;Tangent&quot;, &quot;The Curse&quot;, &quot;Chain Reaction&quot;, &quot;2010&quot;, &quot;Absolute Power&quot;, &quot;Double Jeopardy&quot;, and &quot;Exodus&quot;.",5,War and Politics in Outer Space,1082246400,"04 18, 2004",2004,2480,"['Replicators', 'Russians', 'Aschen', 'are', 'only', 'few', 'new', 'enemies', 'presented', 'year', 'Stargate', 'SG-1', 'okay', 'so', 'technically', 'Replicators', 'were', 'introduced', 'last', 'year', 'new', 'baddies', 'made', 'lot', 'trouble', 'year', 'SGC', 'what', 'definitely', 'best', 'season', 'yet', 'learn', 'more', 'Replicators', 'year', 'when', 'Sam', 'Amanda', 'Tapping', 'brought', 'Asgard-controlled', 'planet', 'help', 'defend', ""O'Neill"", 'Asgard', 'newest', 'most', 'advanced', 'ship', 'ever', 'Also', 'Russians', 'retrieve', 'Giza', 'gate', 'bottom', 'ocean', 'when', 'Thor', 'ship', 'Beliskner', 'crashed', 'SGC', 'now', 'using', 'Antarctica', 'gate', '10', 'years', 'future', 'advanced', 'race', 'known', 'Aschen', 'are', 'quietly', 'wiping', 'out', 'human', 'race', 'making', 'humans', 'infertile.These', 'are', 'just', 'handful', 'amazing', 'new', 'stories', 'occurred', 'year', 'Col.', ""O'Neill"", 'Richard', 'Dean', 'Anderson', 'Maj.', 'Carter', 'Dr.', 'Jackson', 'Michael', 'Shanks', 'Teal', 'c', 'Christopher', 'Judge', 'can', 'never', 'catch', 'break', 'year', 'not', 'only', 'have', 'alien', 'enemies', 'become', 'more', 'powerful', 'ever', 'especially', 'Apophis', 'Peter', 'Williams', 'enemies', 'Earth', 'have', 'truly', 'become', 'threat', 'Senator', 'Kinsey', 'Ronny', 'Cox', 'man', 'who', 'tried', 'shut', 'down', 'SGC', 'Season', '1', 'been', 'linked', 'rogue', 'sector', 'NID', 'civillian', 'organization', 'responsible', 'theft', 'numerous', 'alien', 'technologies', 'last', 'few', 'years.The', 'stories', 'year', 'are', 'better', 'ever', 'especially', 'increasing', 'number', 'arcs', 'occurring', 'Episodes', 'quot', 'Crossroads', 'quot', 'quot', 'Serpent', 'Venom', 'quot', 'were', 'expertly', 'executed', 'had', 'immense', 'emotional', 'effects', 'heroes', 'However', 'have', 'praise', 'stand-alones', 'year', 'especially', 'quot', 'Window', 'Opportunity', 'quot', 'quot', 'Other', 'Side', 'quot', 'have', 'never', 'been', 'better.I', 'guess', 'only', 'thing', 'did', ""n't"", 'like', 'season', 'Asgard', 'were', 'only', 'one', 'episode', 'Tollan', 'Nox', 'were', 'nowhere', 'be', 'found', 'Oh', 'well.If', 'have', 'seen', 'previous', 'three', 'seasons', 'are', 'still', 'skeptical', 'show', 'urge', 'watch', 'Season', '4', 'guarantee', 'interest', 'show', 'will', 'quickly', 'increase.Some', 'other', 'great', 'episodes', 'are', 'quot', 'Small', 'Victories', 'quot', 'quot', 'Upgrades', 'quot', 'quot', 'Watergate', 'quot', 'quot', 'Point', 'No', 'Return', 'quot', 'quot', 'Tangent', 'quot', 'quot', 'Curse', 'quot', 'quot', 'Chain', 'Reaction', 'quot', 'quot', '2010', 'quot', 'quot', 'Absolute', 'Power', 'quot', 'quot', 'Double', 'Jeopardy', 'quot', 'quot', 'Exodus', 'quot']",N/A

Jack wants to blow up the ship, a terraforming Ark of an extinct pacifist civilization, to save the population of rare humans.  The humans are a completely unique race with environmental needs forcing them to live on the planet.  They cannot be evacuated to Earth as their bodies would suffer from Earth's comparatively harsh radiation.  Daniel is determined to persuade the alien's mediator, an exact replica of the rare race of humans, that no one is better placed than the mediator himself to understand the plight of the rare humans and to find another solution that will spare them and mediator needless death.  Time is short, and it is up to Jack to go against orders and to find a military solution that protects the vulnerable humans against the Ark's fire and poisonous gas.  Can Daniel find a solution that spares the humans but also preserves the alien Ark ship?Watch it if you're a real Gate fan.

I would say that in summary season 4 represents more of the show really hitting its stride in terms of character development being fairly complete such that the multilayer-ed story lines are now in full swing.  We are getting to see the alien races encountered over the previous seasons begin to take on a role each nearly as unique as the aliens themselves but with active interaction with SG-1 and the development of interdependence with several of them as some of them start to see that the humans from earth do bring something to the table in contexts varying from a different perspective than the more advance races can achieve anymore (Thor and the Asgard asking for help ) to the Knox recognizing the possibility that SG-1's opinion regarding the behavior of the Ga'uld may actually have merit and as a result take action to protect the those so arrogant in their sense of infallibility caused by not thinking strategically for so long because of not having to actually participate in warfare and as a result demonstrating to them that SG-1 was able to see viable threats they didn't recognize.  All parts of the overall shows many layered storyline facilitated by its long run and part of what makes it such a good show.  There is always that element of repetition that develops, but because of the differences in overall context it allows the episode, while appearing to be formulaic actually serve to progress the bigger story lines forward.  So I think Season 4 i the show at it's best.  There are still advances to come and the eventual changes that caused it to slip, but at this point we still have 6 more seasons and are getting to enjoy the apex of the overall series.So while I appreciate the synopsis's and opinion of the review I referenced earlier I think it understates that the show is now riding its peak and has a more seasons of good shows before we see the eventual decay caused by loss of key characters and the ultimate limitations imposed by it being on modern day earth... thus enter Stargate - Atlantis where those bounds are lifted allowing some plot lines to be developed and played out that being in a different galaxy allows.  A shorter run because of to much territory to cover before they pulled the plug, but that is another show.  For this season I say 4 is part of the peak and without 1-3 would leave the viewer deprived of references that are critical to the enjoyment.  So it doesn't stand on it's own but successfully builds on what has been established to date all the while planting new seeds and stretching bounds keeping the entertainment level high and the quality quite good.",5,Hitting its stride,1399680000,"05 10, 2014",2014,2929,"['like', 'review', 'titled', '34', 'Still', 'Good', 'Show', '34', 'thought', 'what', 'could', 'add', 'then', 'realized', 'may', 'be', 'most', 'detailed', 'review', 'shows', 'season', 'have', 'ever', 'seen', 'synopsis', 'episode', 'full', 'disclosure', ""n't"", 'provide', 'lot', 'terms', 'actual', 'review', 'would', 'say', 'summary', 'season', '4', 'more', 'show', 'really', 'hitting', 'stride', 'terms', 'character', 'development', 'being', 'fairly', 'complete', 'such', 'multilayer-ed', 'story', 'lines', 'are', 'now', 'full', 'swing', 'are', 'getting', 'see', 'alien', 'races', 'encountered', 'previous', 'seasons', 'begin', 'take', 'role', 'nearly', 'as', 'unique', 'aliens', 'active', 'interaction', 'SG-1', 'development', 'interdependence', 'several', 'start', 'see', 'humans', 'earth', 'do', 'bring', 'something', 'table', 'contexts', 'varying', 'different', 'perspective', 'more', 'advance', 'races', 'can', 'achieve', 'anymore', 'Thor', 'Asgard', 'asking', 'help', 'Knox', 'recognizing', 'possibility', 'SG-1', 'opinion', 'regarding', 'behavior', ""Ga'uld"", 'may', 'actually', 'have', 'merit', 'result', 'take', 'action', 'protect', 'so', 'arrogant', 'sense', 'infallibility', 'caused', 'not', 'thinking', 'strategically', 'so', 'long', 'not', 'having', 'actually', 'participate', 'warfare', 'result', 'demonstrating', 'SG-1', 'was', 'able', 'see', 'viable', 'threats', 'did', ""n't"", 'recognize', 'parts', 'overall', 'many', 'layered', 'storyline', 'facilitated', 'long', 'run', 'part', 'what', 'such', 'good', 'show', 'always', 'element', 'repetition', 'differences', 'overall', 'context', 'episode', 'appearing', 'be', 'formulaic', 'actually', 'serve', 'progress', 'bigger', 'story', 'lines', 'forward', 'think', 'Season', '4', 'i', 'show', 'best', 'are', 'still', 'advances', 'come', 'eventual', 'changes', 'caused', 'slip', 'point', 'still', 'have', '6', 'more', 'seasons', 'are', 'getting', 'enjoy', 'apex', 'overall', 'series.So', 'appreciate', 'synopsis', 'opinion', 'review', 'referenced', 'earlier', 'think', 'show', 'now', 'riding', 'peak', 'more', 'seasons', 'good', 'shows', 'see', 'eventual', 'decay', 'caused', 'loss', 'key', 'characters', 'ultimate', 'limitations', 'imposed', 'being', 'modern', 'day', 'earth', 'thus', 'enter', 'Stargate', 'Atlantis', 'where', 'bounds', 'are', 'lifted', 'allowing', 'plot', 'lines', 'be', 'developed', 'played', 'out', 'being', 'different', 'galaxy', 'shorter', 'run', 'much', 'territory', 'cover', 'pulled', 'plug', 'show', 'season', 'say', '4', 'part', 'peak', '1-3', 'would', 'leave', 'viewer', 'deprived', 'references', 'are', 'critical', 'enjoyment', ""n't"", 'stand', 'own', 'successfully', 'builds', 'been', 'established', 'date', 'while', 'planting', 'new', 'seeds', 'stretching', 'bounds', 'keeping', 'entertainment', 'level', 'high', 'quality', 'quite', 'good']",N/A

759146,A1W5U6443BKM84,B00009X75H,Geoffrey F. Arnold,"[5, 7]","Season Four, as many will agree, brings many elements of the series into focus, also introducing some new &quot;long term&quot; baddies into the mix (I suppose for &quot;continuity&quot; into future shows and seasons). The overall quality of the transfer to digital is great with good colour and imaging. The expanded features including the commentary (long overdue) are nice to have, but not all that impressive.My concern, as has been expressed by others, lies more in the &quot;future&quot; of the series. Seven years seems to be the limit for most sci-fi series, beyond which it just gets played for the sake of the playing, not the stories. While now in the seventh season, it doesn't seem that the Stargate will be shutting down any time soon. I've heard that Anderson is exiting the show as a regular. When a primary player bows out (except it is a purposeful plot device), this generally indicates that it's time to wrap things up. The point, I suppose, is that if the story, the primary arc of the series, doesn't move forward more agressively to a meaningful and satisfying conclusion, we risk a complete meltdown of purpose. B5 was smart storytelling -- they created a whole story and then shot it, ending it when it was time, without continuing because of ratings or any other profit motivation. The old adage: &quot;Leave 'em wanting more&quot; is a good rule to follow. Let us pray the producers see the wisdom of a complete story as opposed to milking a good idea beyond the point it ceases being worth the time, effort and expense, which it is now in danger of becoming.",4,Fires on all cylinders,1064275200,"09 23, 2003",2003,1586,"['Season', 'Four', 'many', 'will', 'agree', 'many', 'elements', 'series', 'focus', 'also', 'introducing', 'new', 'quot', 'long', 'term', 'quot', 'baddies', 'mix', 'suppose', 'quot', 'continuity', 'quot', 'future', 'shows', 'seasons', 'overall', 'quality', 'transfer', 'digital', 'great', 'good', 'colour', 'imaging', 'expanded', 'features', 'including', 'commentary', 'long', 'overdue', 'are', 'nice', 'have', 'not', 'impressive.My', 'concern', 'been', 'expressed', 'others', 'more', 'quot', 'future', 'quot', 'series', 'Seven', 'years', 'be', 'limit', 'most', 'sci-fi', 'series', 'just', 'played', 'sake', 'playing', 'not', 'stories', 'now', 'seventh', 'season', ""n't"", 'seem', 'Stargate', 'will', 'be', 'shutting', 'time', 'soon', ""'ve"", 'heard', 'Anderson', 'exiting', 'show', 'regular', 'When', 'primary', 'player', 'out', 'purposeful', 'plot', 'device', 'generally', 'time', 'wrap', 'things', 'up', 'point', 'suppose', 'story', 'primary', 'arc', 'series', ""n't"", 'move', 'forward', 'more', 'agressively', 'meaningful', 'satisfying', 'conclusion', 'risk', 'complete', 'meltdown', 'purpose', 'B5', 'was', 'smart', 'storytelling', 'created', 'whole', 'story', 'then', 'shot', 'ending', 'when', 'was', 'time', 'continuing', 'ratings', 'other', 'profit', 'motivation', 'old', 'adage', 'quot', 'Leave', 'wanting', 'more', 'quot', 'good', 'rule', 'follow', 'Let', 'pray', 'producers', 'see', 'wisdom', 'complete', 'story', 'opposed', 'milking', 'good', 'idea', 'point', 'being', 'time', 'effort', 'expense', 'now', 'danger', 'becoming']",N/A

759156,AQBRMBQ99ESI7,B00009X75H,"John A Lee III ""jal3""","[15, 17]","The fourth season continues to weave as series of complex subplots in an interesting series. Richard Dean Anderson continues to develop both his comedic personality and his sarcastic wit. His playing the comedian to Christopher Judge's Teal'c character's straight man is a delight to watch. The English first crowd should continue to be glad that North American English is the galactic standard.Episode Synopses appear below:Small Victories - The season opens with an old Soviet sub infested with one of the Replicators which were causing havoc in last season's cliffhanging finale. That one replicator manages to reproduce and take over the sub. That is the small problem. The big problem becomes apparent when Thor comes through the Stargate. He comes seeking help. His planet is about to be overrun by replicators and their high-tech has done nothing to help them. They think the Earthlings might be able to help because old fashioned bullets seemed to be able to destroy the spiders. The concept is so primitive that it never would have occurred to them. They hope that more such primitive thinking will help them pull their collective chestnuts out of the fire. The solution to both problems seems to be the same and is summed up in the old human adage, ""you are what you eat.""The Other Side - This is a dark one. Contact comes through the Stargate from a human civilization seeking help. They are involved in a war and are desperately seeking help from any source they can find. It is a fairly advanced civilization and, in return for heavy water to fuel their reactors, they will give of their technology. Col. O'Neill is quick to jump on the offer but something seems wrong. They are very reticent to talk about their enemy or to describe the cause of the war. As time goes on, they begin to show an increasingly ugly side. The team must decide if the technological advances are worth the moral price.Upgrades - A Tok'ra who is haughtier than normal comes through the Stargate seeking help. They have some armbands that came from an extinct civilization which are reputed to give superhuman strength and speed. They want to test them out and learn more about them. They do not use themselves because their ghoul parasites render them immune. It turns out that the armbands do work. They confer phenomenal speed and strength but they have some problems as well. They are addictive, they won't come off and they screw up normal bodily metabolism. This does not seem to bother the Tok'ra scientist who is not only insufferably arrogant and oblivious to the health of the SG1 team. She has a hidden agenda. She wants to use the enhanced powers to carry out a raid against Apothis.Crossroads - A Jaffa priestess comes through the Stargate with strange news. She claims to have learned how to communicate with her larval symbiote. She wants to get in touch with the Tok'Ra so she can transfer the larva. It is past her time to ""deliver"". Without a new host, she will die soon. Everyone is skeptical. Communication with larval symbiotes is supposed to be impossible. The payoff is can be large as well. They ghoul will have valuable knowledge. The new defector to the Tok'ra turns out to be less than trustworthy but, then again, the Tok'ra are not particularly trustworthy themselves.Divide and Conquer - A delegation from Earth is negotiating a formal treaty with the Tok'ra. As the negotiations draw to a close, one of the humans goes crazy, pulls a weapon and tries to assassinate the Tok'ra leader. The attempt is foiled but the human manages to turn his weapon on himself. It turns out that he had been the victim of some sort of Ghoul mind control technology. Now, all of the humans are suspect. Testing reveals one more agent from the other SG teams and then it reveals Col. O'Neill and Maj. Carter as two more. They flunked the test and there is reason to believe that they are part of a plot to assassinate the President or the Tok'ra leader. The truth proves more complex. The detection device is actually a glorified lie detector and they failed the test because of something they refuse to admit even to themselves. That does not stop the assassination attempt, however.Window of Opportunity - It's GROUNDHOG DAY for Col. O'Neill and Teal'c. While the team is investigating an artifact of the ancients on a distant planet in the company of an off-world archeologist, they notice he is acting a bit squirrelly but don't pay much attention due to the big magnetic storm going on all around them. Suddenly, some strange rays shoot out, hit the Stargate and the colonel and Teal'c find themselves back on earth...the day before. They keep reliving the same day over and over again as they try to make sense of the time loop that only they seem to be stuck in. They work hard and also take some time off for pranks they know they can get away with. No Consequences! It's a fun episode.Watergate - When the Stargate fails to lock on to a destination, SGC realizes that it is because another gate is open on earth. They come to realize that the gate they thought had been destroyed on Thor's ship survived reentry and was recovered by the Russians. Now, it is stuck in the ""on"" position and the Russians want help. They seem to know way too much about the super secret Stargate program. The reason turns out to be surprising but not as surprising as what is on the other side of the open gate. It opens under water and the inhabitants of that world are quite...fluid.The First Ones - Daniel and one of his archeologist buddies are on a dig on a planet. They are uncovering fossils of primordial ghouls. Suddenly, the dig crew is attacked by an Unas. It is a very primitive unas. Some of the crew are killed but Daniel is dragged off alive. A rescue mission is sent to find out what happened. The survivors seem dazed. Daniel is terrified. He thinks he is about to become a ritual ""coming of age"" feast for an aboriginal Unas. While he is being transported, however, he begins to develop a relationship with the brute. Now, if the rescue team can just figure out what is making the first wave act funny, they might catch up to Daniel and the Unas before he becomes Purina Unas Chow.Scorched Earth - In a humanitarian gesture, the SG Command endeavors to relocate an entire civilization to a new planet. It is a fairly primitive civilization but they are nice folk. Their previous home had become uninhabitable. The planet to which they are relocated is a rare one which can accommodate them. Just as the people are celebrating their new home, word comes of a great disaster. A gigantic machine is destroying the planet. Actually, it is terraforming the place into an environment suitable for the race that built the machine. That would make it fatal for the humanoids. Actually, they would not have to worry about it because they will not survive the terraforming process. The terra formers can't just pack up and leave because their ship had the capability to restore their civilization on exactly one planet. There are not enough resources to start again. It's a nasty little moral dilemma. Seemingly, one of the two civilization has a chance to survive and the other one is doomed.Beneath the Surface - The crew of SG1 are acting strangely. They are laboring in a subterranean power plant under appalling conditions. Except for Teal'c, they don't even realize who they are. They think they belong working as ""slave labor"". Even Teal'c is not remembering things clearly. A little mind control touch up and the Teal'c problem seems to go away. Meanwhile, back at SGC, everyone is organizing search parties. Nobody can believe that the team could just disappear that way. The government on the planet where they disappeared is not being too cooperative either. It looks like the members of SG1 are condemned to eternal slavery, at least for as long as they live.Point of no Return - The people of the SGC are surprised to get a crank phone call asking for Col. O'Neill. They are even more surprised when the guy shows knowledge of the Stargate. They have no idea who this clown is but they decide they need to check him out. He turns out to be the biggest dweeb/nerd/weirdo ever to grace the small screen. Every clich&eacute; is invoked. He also turns out to be right most of the time. His memory, though, is very faulty. It seems to get things wrong at just the right moments. Oh...and the undercover agents with the drugs, hidden spaceships and black helicopters really out to get him.Tangent - The SG program is starting to bear some technological fruit. They have managed to cobble together some captured parts along with some new fabrications and build a fair copy of a ghoul assault glider. The pilots are having a ball with it until they take it out for a live fire test flight. Teal'c is piloting and O'Neill is in the second seat. Suddenly, the plane heads straight up and just keeps on going. Because of Teal'c's rebellion, Apothis had installed retrieval devices on later gliders. The parts incorporated into the earth design have these recall devices. The earth glider is heading back to Apothis and should get there in a few hundred years...long after they run out of trivial things like air, food and water. The only hope is a rescue mission. The only people available to help are the Tok'ra but they have another mission in mind.The Curse - Daniel learns that his old professor and mentor has died in a strange accident. He goes to the funeral and encounters an old flame and an old rival. He learns that they have been messing around with some artifacts that are of the ghoul variety rather than the Egyptian kind and they have no idea what they have really found. It is dangerous and threatens to unleash two more of the old ""gods"" on earth. Academic rivalries just make matters worse.The Serpent's Venom - While trying to foment revolt among the Jaffa on Chulak, Teal'c is betrayed into the hands of the Ghoul, Herorar. That is not good for anyone concerned especially Teal'c, who face some unpleasant bouts of torture. Herorar has a plan. He want to trade Teal'c to Apothis in the hope of gaining a privileged position in the Apothis regime; Apothis is trying to expand his forces to take over the entire ghoul hierarchy of System Lords. Apothis has his own plans. He want to get Teal'c, betray Herorar and take his army anyway. SG1, needless to say, has plans of their own. They want to prevent an alliance and save Teal'c. The Tok'ra's plans coincide with Stargate Commands in the first part but they consider the Teal'c part optional and unworkable. Everyone has his own idea as to how to proceed. Meanwhile, Teal'c is having a very unpleasant holiday.Chain Reaction - As the SG1 team returns from a dangerous mission, General Hammond informs them that he is retiring. He declines to give any reason. His replacement has all of the warm and fuzzy qualities of George Patton but none of his common sense. When Col. O'Neill starts investigating why Hammond retired, he learns that his grandchildren had been threatened. Some shadowy types want more access and control over the SGC agenda. They only way to get rid of the idiot who is commanding SGC and who is, incidentally, about to get the earth blown up, is to get the goods on some of the slimy politicians that exerted the pressure. This require some deals with the devil.2010 - This is a strange episode that does not fit in too well with the rest of the series. It takes place in 2010. The SG1 team are featured but they are their future selves. They inhabit a nice world in which all is pleasant except for a few minor things. The slimy politician who has caused them so much trouble is now the president. Col. O'Neill retired under a cloud. Maj. Carter is married to somebody else. Humanity is allied with an advanced civilization which has given them longevity drugs. The ghouls are no longer menace. Human fertility is essentially zero. It seems that the advanced race has a plot afoot to extinguish humanity so they can have Earth. When the SG1 team finds out what is happening, they come up with a plan to fix the situation. It involves send a note back through time to themselves.Absolute Power - On a trip to Abydos, Daniel finally meets the harsesis, the son of his dead wife and Apothis. This is the child with the accumulated genetic wisdom of the ghouls and who was taken into the care of an glowing alien some episodes back. He has aged a great deal since then, though he is still a small boy. He has been sent to Daniel to learn of his true mother. The SGC team wants to tap into his knowledge. While conversing with Daniel, the boy imparts a large store of that knowledge directly to him and the result knocks Daniel unconscious. A year later, Daniel is a power mad despot who willingly kills millions just for his own personal purposes. All is not as it seems, however. The boy is just trying to teach his step-dad a BIG lesson.The Light - The members of SG5 begin acting strangely after visiting a new planet. They show signs of depression and their brain chemistry is messed up for no apparent reason. One commits suicide. The others seem heading that way. So does Daniel who had accompanied SG5. They are getting worse and are heading for death. The SG1 team heads back to the planet to try and find out what is happening. There, they find a strange adolescent and an alien device that puts out a strange light show.  When the Doc figures out some of what happens, she determines that they are suffering from withdrawal symptoms something like those from narcotics. O'Neill gets hooked and so do Carter and Teal'c. If they leave the planet for too long, they die. The answers to the reasons like with the boy. Who doesn't know much and doesn't want to reveal what he does know.Prodigy - O'Neill is sent to evaluate a planet for possible use as a permanent research station. It doesn't sound too exciting but he tries to make the best of it. His big problem is with the leader of the scientists who is contemptuous of everything military and jealous of his own authority. The guy seems to think that the Colonel is deliberately trying to sabotage his research when things don't go his own way. Meanwhile, Maj. Carter is giving a lecture at the Air Force Academy. While there, she meets a girl who is possibly the brightest human in a generation. The girl is smart but has an attitude problem. Many think she is not cut out to be an officer. The Major thinks her biggest problem is boredom and a failure to come to grips with the sad fact that not everyone is as bright as she. To solve this problem, she gets permission to take the cadet on a visit to the world where the Colonel is doing his thing. The hope is that she will see an actual goal for all of her disciplined study. It works well until a dangerous alien life form is encountered. Both the cadet and the Major have ideas on how to handle the situation but they are mutually exclusive and the colonel has to make a dangerous choice. It may be that the young lady learns the real meaning of leadership and sacrifice.Entity - A probe sent to a new world goes haywire. It ceases to act under the command of SGC and starts to act independently. It feeds back huge power spikes to the SGC and, as they are attempting to shut things down, it blows the computers there. An alien electronic entity has traveled back to the SGC and all attempts to isolate it are thwarted. Finally, the entity takes over Maj. Carter and uses her mind. It is trying to preserve itself and protect its homeworld. It knows that nobody will willingly hurt Carter. For a while it looks like SGC face the choice of Carter or Earth.Double Jeopardy - The SG1 team returns to a planet they have been to before but they find they are not welcomed. Instead, the locals turn them in to the Ghoul, Chronos. Chronos is glad to have the prisoners; he had in the past vowed vengeance against the SG1 team. He proceeds to have Daniel Jackson killed. That is when we learn that it is not a real Daniel Jackson. It is a robot. In fact, none of these SG1 team members are the real ones. Instead, they are the robots created some episodes back and which promised not to leave their own world. The boredom got to be too much for them and they had to go exploring on their own. It is up to the real SG1 team to save the day.Exodus - As the last episode closed, the SG1 team had managed to capture a ghoul mother ship. In this one, they rendezvous with the Tok'ra. Several episodes ago, Apothis managed to slip an agent into the ranks of the Tok'ra. They were aware of this deception and used him to feed Apothis disinformation. Now, they are evacuating the Tok'ra planet and are suckering Apothis in. They have an ambitious plan to destroy Apothis and his fleet by blowing up the star. They don't think small! The plan seems to work except that Tanis, the ghoul agent manages to escape and Teal'c feels honor bound to go after him. This happens while the clock is ticking on the star to be blown up. As the season comes to its cliffhanger end, the captured mother ship just barely manages to escape the exploding star. Apothis escapes also and he has an SG1 prisoner.",4,Still A Good Show,1137974400,"01 23, 2006",2006,17180,"['fourth', 'season', 'weave', 'series', 'complex', 'subplots', 'interesting', 'series',

But I'll whine later, in private, where it won't annoy anyone.The dvds are great quality, and I haven't had any reading difficulties with them since the Season 1 set. *NOTE: I'm using my PS2 to view these, so if you have a dedicated dvd player, you might have different results. If you're using a PS2 also, well, it'll work fine after Season 1.For light sci-fi, SG-1 is really hard to beat. The characters are entertaining, the dialogue is interesting without being exceptionally simplistic, and Rick Anderson and Christopher Judge give great comedic relief.*SPOILER* The exploration of Jack and Samantha's relationship, and why they aren't pursuing it, is a GREAT change from the tired Remmington Steele/X-Files &quot;we're in love but won't admit it because it would be weird&quot; shtick. I was glad to see them admit how they felt (albeit under duress) and come to obviously temporary terms with it.

Was it the writing?  The special effects budget?  The actors getting comfortable in their roles?  Maybe a combination, but to me this season is where Stargate SG-1 left the ""also ran"" space opras behind and began its ascension (pun intended for you fans) to where it stands today as one of the great epic sci-fi TV series that people will be watching decades from now, I hope.I had just completed watching all the way through season 8 on my own when my wife, who doesn't particularly like sci-fi as a genra, suddenly latched onto this series (another tribute to it's greatness, that non sci-fi fans can enjoy it) and had me watching it again from the first season forward.  I promised to filter the episodes for her and make it a ""best of Stargate SG-1"" kind of thing.During the first three seasons, I enjoyed re-watching the great episodes that established the goa'old (or gooy-old or whatever, even the Stargate actors themselves can't pronounce it consistently) and introduced us to the Nox and other aliens, but there were a number of episodes in each season we could just skip without missing much, and I didn't particularly care to see them again.Then came season four!  Which ones to skip?  They're all, like, really good, and some are brilliant stand alone examples of sci-fi storytelling.  And, they started doing commentaries for each episode!  So, you could watch them once and then relive them through the eyes of the creators of the show.Well, I won't go into each episode, but it's season four that contains the episode that officially made me a Stargate SG-1 fan, and that was ""Window of Opportunity"".  This has got to be one of classic episodic sci-fi episodes ever written for any series, kind of like ""The Inner Light"" was for Star Trek Next Generation.  I saw ""Window of Opportunity"" on TV and thought ""Wow, this show has some writers who know what they're doing"", and then I started buying the series sets and watching from episode one.  The great thing about this episode is not only the Groundhog Day premise, but the sad and thoughtful ending.Anyway, here's your window of opportunity to watch great sci-fi.

759193,A16QODENBJVUI1,B00009X75H,Robert Moore,"[0, 1]","Season Four is in many ways the most difficult to assess of the show's first four.  On the one hand it features a number of absolutely first rate individual episodes, but on the other the larger narrative was developed far less than in seasons two and three.  Almost always such lack of development is the result of network pressures to produce a show that was easier for first-time viewers to access.  Seasons Two and Three saw a vast amount of plot development, as new races and characters were introduced with increasing rapidity.  Season Four cut back on this tremendously, and the overall arc proceeded at a much slower pace.I give Season Four five stars but I am going to confess that this is more a reflection of my opinion of the show as a whole than this season in particular.  I personally think that the more a show pushes the long story arcs, the better it is as a show.  FARSCAPE was never better than when it was pushing its dominant narrative and the same is true of a host of other shows such as THE X-FILES, BUFFY, ANGEL, and LOST.  Many--and I include myself in their ranks--feel that ALIAS began to fade when it mysteriously lost its grasp on its on master narrative. The first three seasons seemed to be leading to something definite, and then it was as if the show started all over again.Nonetheless, while the overall story lagged a bit in Season Four, there were a host of amazingly good episodes.  So there was never a point where the show became slow or tedious.  And there were some great guest appearances.  Willie Garson, who is best known as Stanford, Carrie's gay friend, on SEX AND THE CITY had a nice appearance as an alien stranded on earth.  He has since reprised the character.So, while the big story didn't progress very much in Season Four, it remained a highly entertaining and high quality Sci-fi show.",5,Another strong season for a very fine Sci-fi series,1150675200,"06 19, 2006",2006,1841,"['Season', 'Four', 'many', 'ways', 'most', 'difficult', 'assess', 'show', 'first', 'four', 'one', 'hand', 'number', 'absolutely', 'first', 'rate', 'individual', 'episodes', 'other', 'larger', 'narrative', 'was', 'developed', 'far', 'less', 'seasons', 'two', 'three', 'Almost', 'always', 'such', 'lack', 'development', 'result', 'network', 'pressures', 'produce', 'show', 'was', 'easier', 'first-time', 'viewers', 'access', 'Seasons', 'Two', 'Three', 'saw', 'vast', 'amount', 'plot', 'development', 'new', 'races', 'characters', 'were', 'introduced', 'increasing', 'rapidity', 'Season', 'Four', 'cut', 'back', 'tremendously', 'overall', 'arc', 'proceeded', 'much', 'slower', 'pace.I', 'give', 'Season', 'Four', 'five', 'stars', 'am', 'going', 'confess', 'more', 'reflection', 'opinion', 'show', 'whole', 'season', 'particular', 'personally', 'think', 'more', 'show', 'long', 'story', 'arcs', 'better', 'show', 'FARSCAPE', 'was', 'never', 'better', 'when', 'was', 'pushing', 'dominant', 'narrative', 'same', 'true', 'host', 'other', 'shows', 'such', 'X-FILES', 'BUFFY', 'ANGEL', 'LOST', 'Many', 'include', 'ranks', 'feel', 'ALIAS', 'began', 'fade', 'when', 'mysteriously', 'lost', 'grasp', 'master', 'narrative', 'first', 'three', 'seasons', 'seemed', 'be', 'leading', 'something', 'definite', 'then', 'was', 'show', 'started', 'again.Nonetheless', 'overall', 'story', 'lagged', 'bit', 'Season', 'Four', 'were', 'host', 'amazingly', 'good', 'episodes', 'So', 'was', 'never', 'point', 'where', 'show', 'became', 'slow', 'tedious', 'were', 'great', 'guest', 'appearances', 'Willie', 'Garson', 'who', 'best', 'known', 'Stanford', 'Carrie', 'gay', 'friend', 'SEX', 'THE', 'CITY', 'had', 'nice', 'appearance', 'alien', 'stranded', 'earth', 'reprised', 'character.So', 'big', 'story', 'did', ""n't"", 'progress', 'very', 'much', 'Season', 'Four', 'remained', 'highly', 'entertaining', 'high', 'quality', 'Sci-fi', 'show']",N/A

Considering team dynamics we are made aware of the importance of Daniel Jackson as he becomes ""the conscience"" of the team. Michael Shanks gives his best performances in the episodes where he actively challenges the authority of O'Neill like ""The Other side"" or ""Scorched Earth"". A lot of episodes in this season focus on Daniel and most of them are excellent. I particularly like the episode called ""The First Ones"" where Daniel becomes the hostage of a young Unas, the creature whose race were first hosts to Goa'uld.Carter and O'Neill relationship is repeatedly touched but never gets any conclusion and what is more important the love story doesn't become the center of all the stories. Teal'c and O'Neill develop their friendship to the next level.The humor has become the trademark of the show and in some episodes it is much better than any sitcom I have ever seen. Mostly it is due to Richard Dean Anderson's perfect comedic timing and delivery, but Christopher Judge contributes greatly with his stoic presentation.From the technical point of view this season is a step forward. Like the previous three it is presented in widescreen 16:9 format but this time the picture is better but still some digital artifacts and a little noise is visible in some scenes.

It is a little confusing at first but after a few episodes you can figure it out, and then surprisingly find yourself hooked (be prepared to purchase every season after this one!).What this DVD is offering is unique in that it gives you commentaries for every episodes.  What ever advice they told these writers, directors and others before the commentary should be extended to the rest of the entertainment industries. The lively banter is entertaining and makes you wish you could have been there to lend a hand.  Peter Deluise (who if you are a certain age will remember his stint on 21 Jump Street) was particularly entertaining in his commentaries as a director and creative influence to the series.  In the episode Prodigy he even goaded his fellow commenters to sing the lyrics to the theme song which might not be up for any awards but was a perfect example of the fun they had creating this series.This was a great season  for any science fiction series, and although one might blame them from ripping off from other plots scattered through out time such as Window of Opportunity which was groundhog day in space, or Beneath the Surface which resembled Metropolis with some dirt they added their own panache.Richard Dean Anderson, Michael Shanks, Amanda Tappings and Christopher Judge are a each pretty fun to watch.
