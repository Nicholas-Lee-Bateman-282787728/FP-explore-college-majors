Because I tend to stick to the indies and art house genre of film, or films directed by talented filmmakers such as Tim Burton, Frank Capra, Sofia Coppola, Alfred Hitchcock, Alejandro Gonz&aacute;lez I&ntilde;&aacute;rritu, Sam Mendes, and Giuseppe Tornatore. Nevertheless, I was in high school around the time the first ""American Pie"" was released, and always enjoyed them. So, going against my better judgment, and never letting my fellow film major buddies in college know, I watched this direct-to-DVD sequel and I must say: it was rather funny. Seriously. Funny enought that I even watched it another four times. So, despite the fact that it's the 5th in the series, and its direct-to-DVD featuring a cast of unknowns, I must say...its rather enjoyable.",4,"Decent, and pretty funny",1170547200,"02 4, 2007",2007,820,"['am', 'someone', 'who', 'would', 'never', 'watch', 'movie', 'such', 'Why', 'tend', 'stick', 'indies', 'art', 'house', 'genre', 'film', 'films', 'directed', 'talented', 'filmmakers', 'such', 'Tim', 'Burton', 'Frank', 'Capra', 'Sofia', 'Coppola', 'Alfred', 'Hitchcock', 'Alejandro', 'Gonz', 'aacute', 'ntilde', 'aacute', 'rritu', 'Sam', 'Mendes', 'Giuseppe', 'Tornatore', 'Nevertheless', 'was', 'high', 'school', 'time', 'first', 'American', 'Pie', 'was', 'released', 'always', 'enjoyed', 'So', 'going', 'better', 'judgment', 'never', 'letting', 'fellow', 'film', 'major', 'buddies', 'college', 'know', 'watched', 'direct-to-DVD', 'sequel', 'must', 'say', 'was', 'rather', 'funny', 'Seriously', 'Funny', 'enought', 'even', 'watched', 'four', 'times', 'So', 'fact', '5th', 'series', 'direct-to-DVD', 'featuring', 'cast', 'unknowns', 'must', 'say', 'rather', 'enjoyable']",American Pie - The Naked Mile
1027249,A1NV8HZTGKIPXQ,B000JJSJPU,"Barry ""Barrybgb""","[20, 30]","As a fan of the series, I was looking forward to another chapter, even tho they are not the same. I thought ""Band Camp"" was a decent enough DVD sequel, and now we have this latest installment. It's definitley not out of the question by saying that this is the worst film in the franchise. Band Camp was no great prize, but it was better than this one. I look forward to fun teenage comedy, but if this is the latest effort in what was a pretty good trilogy of raunch, then it's time to put the pies away. The fifth piece of pie is the one where you say ""I'm stuffed!. I can't take another piece!"". More on this in a bit. The story?. Pretty simple. We are introduced to Eric Stifler, cousin to Steve(from the original trilogy), and cousin to Matt(of Band Camp fame). Unlike those two, he is very un-Stiflerlike. He hasn't done anything real crazy or outrageous, and horror of horrors, is looking to graduate high school as a virgin. In ways, Eric is more like Jim than his real family. His friends decide to go to a college campus for the weekend to participate in the Naked Mile, where students run naked for...well, it's self explanatory. There, Eric plans to make the most of the situation and live up to the family name. He wants to be a real Stifler once and for all. In addition, his girlfriend Tracy(who wants to wait for sex), gives him a free pass for the weekend to do what he needs to do. Yeah, right. This film doesn't have any real feel to the other Pie films. Band Camp did in some ways. It had Matt Stifler, who had acted like his big bro(and therefore made it feel like the earlier films). Why didn't we continue with that character?. It would of been somewhat of an improvement. Plus, that film had more of Jim's dad(here, he is just a passing character). BC's location at Band Camp is also a tie in with the original films. Except for the appearance of Eugene Levy(who is wated, but nonetheless is the only good part of the entire movie), this film could of dropped the 'American Pie' title since it feels disconnected. What the other films also had that this film doesn't is heart. The original trilogy seemed to be more about the characters and what happens to them with genuine heart. Even BC, to a lesser degree, managed to get some of that heart. This one doesn't come near it. It tries, but it feels forced and unmoving. The raunch factor is ricocheted up to a higher notch than all previous 'Pie' films and it's uncalled for. The others weren't exactly subtle, but this one felt like it was trying to hit you over the head with it. The cast is nothing special. Our lead Stifler is bland and boring, and his friends aren't as fun or interesting as our original gang. In fact, most of the people here are unlikeable. We are also introduced to another Stifler Cousin, Dwight, who keeps more in line with his cousins. Sadly, he is more of an annoying caricature than anything else. Is it funny?. Not really. With the exception of Levy and Christopher MacDonald(who should of had a bigger part)as Eric's dad talking at the dinner table, I didn't really laugh once. The different scene in the Special Features section of this was even funnier. Why was that one left out?. It says the movie goes the extra mile to get laughs. Yes, it tries hard, but it doesn't get them. I can't find anything to recommend.",1,American Pie Presents : Beating A Dead Horse,1166745600,"12 22, 2006",2006,3323,"['fan', 'series', 'was', 'looking', 'forward', 'chapter', 'even', 'are', 'not', 'same', 'thought', 'Band', 'Camp', 'was', 'decent', 'enough', 'DVD', 'sequel', 'now', 'have', 'latest', 'installment', 'definitley', 'not', 'question', 'saying', 'worst', 'film', 'franchise', 'Band', 'Camp', 'was', 'great', 'prize', 'was', 'better', 'one', 'look', 'forward', 'fun', 'teenage', 'comedy', 'latest', 'effort', 'what', 'was', 'pretty', 'good', 'trilogy', 'raunch', 'then', 'time', 'put', 'pies', 'away', 'fifth', 'piece', 'pie', 'one', 'where', 'say', ""'m"", 'stuffed', 'ca', ""n't"", 'take', 'piece', 'More', 'bit', 'story', 'Pretty', 'simple', 'are', 'introduced', 'Eric', 'Stifler', 'cousin', 'Steve', 'original', 'trilogy', 'cousin', 'Matt', 'Band', 'Camp', 'fame', 'two', 'very', 'un-Stiflerlike', ""n't"", 'done', 'anything', 'real', 'crazy', 'outrageous', 'horror', 'horrors', 'looking', 'graduate', 'high', 'school', 'virgin', 'ways', 'Eric', 'more', 'Jim', 'real', 'family', 'friends', 'decide', 'go', 'college', 'campus', 'weekend', 'participate', 'Naked', 'Mile', 'where', 'students', 'run', 'naked', 'well', 'self', 'explanatory', 'Eric', 'make', 'most', 'situation', 'live', 'up', 'family', 'name', 'be', 'real', 'Stifler', 'once', 'addition', 'girlfriend', 'Tracy', 'who', 'wait', 'sex', 'free', 'pass', 'weekend', 'do', 'what', 'do', 'Yeah', 'right', 'film', ""n't"", 'have', 'real', 'feel', 'other', 'Pie', 'films', 'Band', 'Camp', 'did', 'ways', 'had', 'Matt', 'Stifler', 'who', 'had', 'acted', 'big', 'bro', 'therefore', 'made', 'feel', 'earlier', 'films', 'Why', 'did', ""n't"", 'continue', 'character', 'would', 'been', 'somewhat', 'improvement', 'film', 'had', 'more', 'Jim', 'dad', 'here', 'just', 'passing', 'character', 'BC', 'location', 'Band', 'Camp', 'also', 'tie', 'original', 'films', 'appearance', 'Eugene', 'Levy', 'who', 'wated', 'nonetheless', 'only', 'good', 'part', 'entire', 'movie', 'film', 'could', 'dropped', ""'American"", 'Pie', 'title', 'disconnected', 'What', 'other', 'films', 'also', 'had', 'film', ""n't"", 'heart', 'original', 'trilogy', 'seemed', 'be', 'more', 'characters', 'what', 'genuine', 'heart', 'Even', 'BC', 'lesser', 'degree', 'managed', 'get', 'heart', 'one', ""n't"", 'come', 'forced', 'unmoving', 'raunch', 'factor', 'ricocheted', 'up', 'higher', 'notch', 'previous', ""'Pie"", 'films', 'uncalled', 'others', 'were', ""n't"", 'exactly', 'subtle', 'one', 'felt', 'was', 'trying', 'hit', 'head', 'cast', 'nothing', 'special', 'lead', 'Stifler', 'bland', 'boring', 'friends', 'are', ""n't"", 'fun', 'interesting', 'original', 'gang', 'fact', 'most', 'people', 'here', 'are', 'unlikeable', 'are', 'also', 'introduced', 'Stifler', 'Cousin', 'Dwight', 'who', 'more', 'line', 'cousins', 'Sadly', 'more', 'annoying', 'caricature', 'anything', 'else', 'funny', 'Not', 'really', 'exception', 'Levy', 'Christopher', 'MacDonald', 'who', 'should', 'had', 'bigger', 'part', 'Eric', 'dad', 'talking', 'dinner', 'table', 'did', ""n't"", 'really', 'laugh', 'once', 'different', 'scene', 'Special', 'Features', 'section', 'was', 'even', 'funnier', 'Why', 'was', 'one', 'left', 'out', 'movie', 'extra', 'mile', 'get', 'laughs', 'Yes', 'hard', ""n't"", 'get', 'ca', ""n't"", 'find', 'anything', 'recommend']",American Pie - The Naked Mile

I especially wasn't a fan of the first spin-off inAmerican Pie Presents: Band Camp. This movie is pretty decent though. It has its comedic spots and a good main character.Erik Stifler is a member of the notorious Stifler family. The Stifler family is known for having no problems getting ""action"". This being said, Erik is a virgin and is entering his final years in high school. His girlfriend just isn't ready for that type of commitment. Erik waits patiently but tells her he can't wait forever. Erik and two of his friends are making plans to go to the Naked Mile. The Naked Mile is where hundreds of college students run naked through the streets to enjoy themselves after exams. Erik is given a guilt-free pass for the weekend, meaning he can do whatever he wants without her saying anything. His girlfriend soon wants to revoke the pass, but is convinced to trust her boyfriend to not do anything wrong. Erik soon begins his adventures at the Naked Mile, which includes fighting little people.Erik is your common loser who is worried that if he doesn't get ""action"" soon he will be laughed at forever. This is a great change from the past Stifler characters that have all been idiots. Idiots just don't work as compelling main characters.The story is somewhat predictable. You know pretty much that he's going to run back to his girlfriend. I didn't want to spoil the movie, but it really is that obvious. Still, the comedy in between is fairly good. You'll see things like little people destroying normal sized people in football, which is very entertaining.Another good thing about this DVD is the extras. You get your usual behind the scenes and commentary stuff. On this DVD you will get a guide on how to pick up women at Yoga. You also get to see the actors getting their butts waxed, which is very entertaining.I wouldn't say that this is a movie you need to go out and pick up. It's a decent movie with some decent extras.

Besides the obvious storyline of two love sick teen virgins, not knowing if they want sex or not, realizing somewhat that they love each other, just to have sex and realize again that it was only sexaul frustration. The Naked Mile was exactly what it says people running completely nude. Other than the storyline, I love the nudity, I love the sex and I love the humor, also the deleted scene with the Stiflers was great it should have been kept. And DAMN how many Stiflers are there! I don't care neither, keep them coming ! No matter what people say, these characters make this series, unlike the Band Camp movie when they humanized the Stifler character, in this one you still had one prick of a Stifler and that was great. Some may think they beating a dead horse with this but I say as long as you making MILLIONS with every title, KEEP DOING IT. The National Lampoons' franchise is basically beating a dead horse with dead comedies, REALLY, nothing good since ANIMAL HOUSE, EUROPEAN VACATION, AND VEGAS BACHELOR PARTY (hey it is funny).

1027265,APOUYO1BEPK22,B000JJSJPU,"M. B Cole ""Kegrun""","[1, 1]","At first there was Steve. Then there was Matt. Now... there is Erik. Stiflers. And we all know how the Stiflers are. Or do we? Actually Erik is more of a normal guy than any of them. He's so normal that no one even calls him Stifler like his cousins Steve, Matt, and even Dwight. It's just plain old Erik. Who by the way is a senior AND a virgin. BLASPHEMY for the Stifler name. But it's ok for Erik, sort of. He's in love with his girlfriend of 2 years who is also a virgin, so he does what he can to help relieve the stress...if you get my drift. As time goes on though, it gets even worse for him because he is constantly getting made fun of, and as we all know, standards are black and white different for being a virgin guy or a virgin girl. After some failed attempts, Tracy (his girl) decides she still isn't ready. Though to try and make him happy, she lets him have a guilt free weekend, which is basically letting him do anything he wants. Just so happens though he's going to visit his other cousin at college... Dwight Stifler, the king of his frat house and a campus legend.The first time I viewed this, I thought it was decent addition to the series, but now after seeing it a second time, I actually liked it a lot more the second time through. The jokes were pretty funny, but I think I just really liked the characters more than anything. Sure it can be unbelievable, but it's an American Pie movie. Erik was a little more interesting as a Stifler this time around, because it was nice to see just a normal Stifler compared to all the crazy ones we see. Of course he's still trying to get laid, but at least it's with his girlfriend instead of the whole world. And Dwight Stifler, to me, was a really cool Stifler. A lot less insane than Steve, and much cooler than Matt. He's exactly what I think of when I think of a frat house legend. Everyone wants to party with him, they basically cheer at anything he says, and he's always got some crazy sayings or ideas.And boy is there a lot of nekidness. Lots. As for the jokes, there were plenty for sure. Not all were funny (like a certain money shot scene that involved two guys), but I did laugh quite a bit. And the midgets...oh man. Talk about stealing the scenes. They had some of the best parts. I loved how they were the arch enemies of Dwight's frat. The football game was ridiculous (it was also like 10 minutes of the film...crazy) between those two. When the main midget dude bites Dwight, and even when you KNOW it's coming, I still laughed pretty hard.In the end, definitely give it a try. It's not that bad at all. I'm glad I own it.P.S. - I reviewed Beta House (part 6) already in the past so give it a looky loo if you'd like.",4,Ruuun Stifler... RUUUUN!

And although the only character from the original 3 American Pie/Wedding movies returning in this film is Jim Levenstines Dad (played by the one and only talented Canadian actor Eugene Levy) it still has a lot of good funny new characters in it such as Eric Stiffler (a HS senior and quite possibly the only Stiffler who hasn't been laid in highschool and actually has/had a steady girlfriend in high school), Rock and the vertically challenged from the Lambda fraternity and their older brother who is the only member of the house not vertically challenged, and my personal favorite Dwight Stiffler (cousin to Steve, Matt, and Eric Stiffer ).  And thank god this movie does not have the older version of Matt Stiffler or anyone else aside from Jim's dad who had a part in the movie ""American Pie Presents Band Camp"" in it.

Erik is a different Stiffler, he has a concience and a brain other than the one down below.  But, the movie line is the same, High School Kids wanting to have sex. And hopefully they don't create any more stifflers, it getting old. But, the movie has its funny parts, but its no classic like the first three.  How much teenage Angst can you squeeze out of a series, this one is testing the limit.  Also, this unrated version pushes the nudity up to an all new level for the series.  So, an entertaining rental, but not a must have.",3,"Ok, entertaining at times, some humor, but the story is getting a bit thin.",1166659200,"12 21, 2006",2006,864,"['Released', 'straight', 'DVD', 'Naked', 'Mile', '5th', 'movie', 'american', 'pie', 'series', 'last', 'two', 'Band', 'Camp', 'one', 'concentrate', 'Family', 'Stiffler', 'one', 'cousing', 'original', 'Stiffler', 'Erik', 'who', 'cousin', 'Michigan', 'annual', 'Naked', 'Mile', 'party', 'original', 'stiffler', 'family', 'gone', 'Erik', 'different', 'Stiffler', 'concience', 'brain', 'other', 'one', 'down', 'movie', 'line', 'same', 'High', 'School', 'Kids', 'wanting', 'have', 'sex', 'hopefully', 'do', ""n't"", 'create', 'more', 'stifflers', 'getting', 'old', 'movie', 'funny', 'parts', 'classic', 'first', 'three', 'How', 'much', 'teenage', 'Angst', 'can', 'squeeze', 'series', 'one', 'testing', 'limit', 'Also', 'unrated', 'version', 'nudity', 'up', 'new', 'level', 'series', 'So', 'entertaining', 'rental', 'not', 'must', 'have']",American Pie - The Naked Mile
