854988,AK7CAW3N1XZV6,B00049QQLE,"Beth Cholette ""doctor_beth""","[14, 16]","This nice lower body practice does a good job of thoroughly stretching the legs and opening the hips.  Instructor Sara Ivanhoe begins the practice in a standing position with several variations of chair pose; each variation is held for a few breaths.  She then moves on to a triangle-warrior series for strengthening the leg muscles followed by a temple pose (a plie squat)-fan pose (wide-legged standing forward bend) combo which really stretches the legs, especially the hamstrings.  The practice then moves on to the floor for camel pose, first performed with one hand only on each side then both hands.  Finally, there is a lunge-lunge twist-pigeon-cobbler series that is perfect for opening the hips, and Sara finishes the practice with a simple seated yoga mudra (hand placement with breath).I enjoyed this practice a lot, as I'm always looking to open up my legs and hips.  This would be an excellent yoga practice for runners or other sports participants whose lower body has become tight.  However, because Sara does not provide detailed instruction, I would not recommend this practice for those with no prior experience to yoga.  Finally, I think this routine is too short to provide much ""sculpting,"" but it is an excellent practice for stretching the lower body.",5,A nice lower body focused practice,1100995200,"11 21, 2004",2004,1275,"['nice', 'lower', 'body', 'practice', 'good', 'job', 'thoroughly', 'stretching', 'legs', 'opening', 'hips', 'Instructor', 'Sara', 'Ivanhoe', 'practice', 'standing', 'position', 'several', 'variations', 'chair', 'pose', 'variation', 'held', 'few', 'breaths', 'then', 'triangle-warrior', 'series', 'strengthening', 'leg', 'muscles', 'followed', 'temple', 'pose', 'plie', 'squat', '-fan', 'pose', 'wide-legged', 'standing', 'forward', 'bend', 'combo', 'really', 'legs', 'especially', 'hamstrings', 'practice', 'then', 'floor', 'camel', 'pose', 'first', 'performed', 'one', 'hand', 'only', 'side', 'then', 'hands', 'Finally', 'lunge-lunge', 'twist-pigeon-cobbler', 'series', 'perfect', 'opening', 'hips', 'Sara', 'practice', 'simple', 'seated', 'yoga', 'mudra', 'hand', 'placement', 'breath', 'enjoyed', 'practice', 'lot', ""'m"", 'always', 'looking', 'open', 'up', 'legs', 'hips', 'would', 'be', 'excellent', 'yoga', 'practice', 'runners', 'other', 'sports', 'participants', 'lower', 'body', 'become', 'tight', 'However', 'Sara', 'not', 'provide', 'detailed', 'instruction', 'would', 'not', 'recommend', 'practice', 'prior', 'experience', 'yoga', 'Finally', 'think', 'routine', 'too', 'short', 'provide', 'much', 'sculpting', 'excellent', 'practice', 'stretching', 'lower', 'body']",Sara Ivanhoe's 20 Min Yoga Makeover - Sculpted Buns & Thighs

I would rather spend a bit more and get several 20-minute workouts. This would be better priced around $9.Please check my other reviews on Amazon for great Yoga DVD's. Shiva Rea's new DVD is wonderful and well worth the extra money.

854991,A281NPSIMI1C2R,B00049QQLE,"Rebecca of Amazon ""The Rebecca Review""","[5, 5]","Sara Ivanhoe's routines are a pure joy to follow and this one is perfect in combination with the 20-minute weight loss routine. The first routine warms you up and this one pushes you just that little bit further so you get the best workout possible. She teaches everyone from Hollywood stars to normal people like me who don't want to go to the gym and prefer working out at home.This creative routine will sculpt buns and thighs and also cleanse your soul. By focusing on breathing, you nurture every cell in your body. If you have been working out for quite a few years, some of the exercises in this routine can help you figure out if you are intermediate or advanced.While beginners will still enjoy most of the exercises, intermediate students will enjoy knowing if they can do a back bend (you are kneeling and you lean backwards) and touch their ankles or if they are still working on flexibility. I can tell you that for the last few years I've been trying to touch my ankles and tonight I actually did. It is definitely worth working towards and boosts your self-esteem substantially. There was just this sense of joy when I could finally touch both ankles. All those hundreds of hours of practice suddenly seem worth the effort!Mountain, Chair and Triangle pose are included as is a Temple Pose with three lovely variations. There are also some excellent outer hip stretches in this 20-minute routine.What I love most about this DVD is the aesthetically pleasing environment and the highly creative exercises. The mood of Sara's workouts encourages my full participation and I find them especially enjoyable. Do two of her workouts and then go take a long bath with sea salts and essential oils.

854992,ATKVDKXO3Q6ZM,B00049QQLE,Teedums,"[1, 1]","Sara Ivanhoe leads you through this 20 minute practice focused on the lower body, which is the area that I need the most help in so I was glad to pick this one up.  The setting is terrific, the ocean and mountains are behind Sara, very colorful.  The music is soft and nothing special but it suits the practice fine.The first part of the practice starts out standing, you will warm up with a variety of chair poses, each with a different arm position.  Then you will move into a series consisting of triangle, half moon and warrior, followed by a series of temple and fan poses, again with different arm positions.  Then you will move to the floor, starting with camel pose, then you will move into a lunge stretch later adding a twist. Then you will finish out with pigeon and a stretch for the outer hips before repeating the series on the other side, this time ending in cobblers pose. Finally Sara leads you through a mudra which completes the yoga practice.I like this routine a lot, it's not very difficult but I find it refreshing and relaxing in a way, not sure if it will sculpt your buns and thighs but it will certainly stretch them out.  Yes, it is short but these days I am finding it difficult to fit in yoga at all so I am grateful for these short yoga practices.  Sara is my favorite yoga instructor, I seem to click with her style well, she is friendly, encouraging and non intimidating which I like.
