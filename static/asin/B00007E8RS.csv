727257,ANYDQIA5YVBMM,B00007E8RS,Alan Ramirez,"[19, 20]","I just can't believe that year after year great shows keep getting cancelled by networks. ""The L.A. Complex"" delivers everything anyone could want in a drama: sex, secrets, lies, twists and an appealing cast. The plot is pretty easy to follow, and it easily becomes an addiction after watching the first two or three episodes. Jewel Staite as Raquel was always my favorite. I think she's one of the best canadian actresses on TV, and her talent is just amazing. The storylines (a little bit crazy), manage to stay true to reality, and you get to understand and love the characters after a few episodes (which is really strange for me to love and care for characters so fast).It's such a shame that nobody saw this show when it came out on TV, because it would had been a hit if it had gotten the right promotion or marketing, and I know that the ones who saw this show when it aired know what I'm talking about; it had everything to be everyone's obsession. I always called it everything thatMelrose Place: The DVD Edition (4 Discs)never was.I'm glad it's coming out on DVD! I wasn't expecting such a low rated show (but still good) coming out on DVD, but I'm buying it when it comes out. If you're looking for a great new refreshing TV series, you'll fall in love with ""The L.A. Complex"". At least the fans now will have this amazing show on their collections. I'm surely watching the whole series again when I get this set.UPDATE:Now that I got the DVD, I can tell you it's a decent-ish relase. It doesn't have close captions or english subtitles, and the bonus features are just deleted scenes, audio commentaries (for the pilot and the last episode) and bloopers. The episodes are on widescreen, and the audio is on 2.0 which is a shame because when it aired it had 5.1 audio. The video is great, very clear.",5,A hidden gem,1371600000,"06 19, 2013",2013,1812,"['just', 'ca', ""n't"", 'believe', 'year', 'year', 'great', 'shows', 'keep', 'getting', 'cancelled', 'networks', 'L.A.', 'Complex', 'delivers', 'everything', 'anyone', 'could', 'want', 'drama', 'sex', 'secrets', 'lies', 'twists', 'appealing', 'cast', 'plot', 'pretty', 'easy', 'follow', 'easily', 'addiction', 'watching', 'first', 'two', 'three', 'episodes', 'Jewel', 'Staite', 'Raquel', 'was', 'always', 'favorite', 'think', 'one', 'best', 'canadian', 'actresses', 'TV', 'talent', 'just', 'amazing', 'storylines', 'little', 'bit', 'crazy', 'manage', 'stay', 'true', 'reality', 'get', 'understand', 'love', 'characters', 'few', 'episodes', 'really', 'strange', 'love', 'care', 'characters', 'so', 'fast', '.It', 'such', 'shame', 'nobody', 'saw', 'show', 'when', 'came', 'out', 'TV', 'would', 'had', 'been', 'hit', 'had', 'gotten', 'right', 'promotion', 'marketing', 'know', 'ones', 'who', 'saw', 'show', 'when', 'aired', 'know', 'what', ""'m"", 'talking', 'had', 'everything', 'be', 'everyone', 'obsession', 'always', 'called', 'everything', 'thatMelrose', 'Place', 'DVD', 'Edition', '4', 'Discs', 'never', 'was.I', ""'m"", 'glad', 'coming', 'out', 'DVD', 'was', ""n't"", 'expecting', 'such', 'low', 'rated', 'show', 'still', 'good', 'coming', 'out', 'DVD', ""'m"", 'buying', 'when', 'out', ""'re"", 'looking', 'great', 'new', 'refreshing', 'TV', 'series', ""'ll"", 'fall', 'love', 'L.A.', 'Complex', 'least', 'fans', 'now', 'will', 'have', 'amazing', 'show', 'collections', ""'m"", 'surely', 'watching', 'whole', 'series', 'again', 'when', 'get', 'set.UPDATE', 'Now', 'got', 'DVD', 'can', 'tell', 'decent-ish', 'relase', ""n't"", 'have', 'close', 'captions', 'english', 'subtitles', 'bonus', 'features', 'are', 'just', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'audio', 'commentaries', 'pilot', 'last', 'episode', 'bloopers', 'episodes', 'are', 'widescreen', 'audio', '2.0', 'shame', 'when', 'aired', 'had', '5.1', 'audio', 'video', 'great', 'very', 'clear']",N/A

Hopes and dreams that can be shatter, but one is able &#34;no matter how difficult life can be&#34; leaves us with the propensity to move on and move productively forward. Life is not always kind, our rewards for diligent work and pursuits are not always recompense by the good that we do; sometime, life can slap you in the face more than once, before you reap your rewards. The scene, that is to say the acting industry is not essentially based on talent, looks, assiduous work; I believe much of the aspirations and success we do has to do with divine intervention. Perhaps we are born for certain roles in life, and when we are born we are set on course to reach those objectives for a very specific purpose, then we move on in order to facilitate the person who is designated to carry on or follow through and build upon what we have started - and I don't believe that there ever is an end to a story, because someone else comes behind each of us and continue the progress or process until the &#34;Father - I call Him God&#34; ends the entire life-long story for the world as we know it. The cast is superb, the plot has virtually everything that mirrors life - which in essence the characters are playing each of our parts; regardless who you are, I suspect if everyone would look a little closer, they will finds a little piece of themselves in the saga somewhere. So there you have it - this one man's opinion about such a poignant characterization of life in general. I do appreciate the various films that can mirror human life in its real context, and still have a bit of entertainment edge in it; hopefully, it will touch all of our lives in someway, and represent each of us in a special or unique way, that will help us step back, and see the humor within ourselves, and not take it all so serious.",5,our rewards for diligent work and pursuits are not always recompense by the good that we do,1404864000,"07 9, 2014",2014,1866,"['series', 'have', 'everything', 'really', 'mirrors', 'life', 'Hopes', 'dreams', 'can', 'be', 'shatter', 'one', 'able', '34', 'matter', 'how', 'difficult', 'life', 'can', 'be', '34', 'propensity', 'move', 'move', 'productively', 'forward', 'Life', 'not', 'always', 'kind', 'rewards', 'diligent', 'work', 'pursuits', 'are', 'not', 'always', 'recompense', 'good', 'do', 'sometime', 'life', 'can', 'slap', 'face', 'more', 'once', 'reap', 'rewards', 'scene', 'say', 'acting', 'industry', 'not', 'essentially', 'based', 'talent', 'assiduous', 'work', 'believe', 'much', 'aspirations', 'success', 'do', 'do', 'divine', 'intervention', 'Perhaps', 'are', 'born', 'certain', 'roles', 'life', 'when', 'are', 'born', 'are', 'set', 'course', 'reach', 'objectives', 'very', 'specific', 'purpose', 'then', 'move', 'order', 'facilitate', 'person', 'who', 'designated', 'carry', 'follow', 'build', 'what', 'have', 'started', 'do', ""n't"", 'believe', 'ever', 'end', 'story', 'someone', 'else', 'continue', 'progress', 'process', '34', 'Father', 'call', 'Him', 'God', '34', 'entire', 'life-long', 'story', 'world', 'know', 'cast', 'superb', 'plot', 'virtually', 'everything', 'mirrors', 'life', 'essence', 'characters', 'are', 'playing', 'parts', 'regardless', 'who', 'are', 'suspect', 'everyone', 'would', 'look', 'little', 'closer', 'will', 'finds', 'little', 'piece', 'saga', 'somewhere', 'So', 'there', 'have', 'one', 'man', 'opinion', 'poignant', 'characterization', 'life', 'general', 'do', 'appreciate', 'various', 'films', 'can', 'mirror', 'human', 'life', 'real', 'context', 'still', 'have', 'bit', 'entertainment', 'edge', 'hopefully', 'will', 'touch', 'lives', 'someway', 'represent', 'special', 'unique', 'way', 'will', 'help', 'step', 'back', 'see', 'humor', 'ourselves', 'not', 'take', 'so', 'serious']",N/A

I enjoyed virtually every episode, many of which I did my best to see live on the air on the CW.This DVD set collects all 19 episodes, but in the interest of economy (remember, this was unfortunately one of the lowest rated dramas in broadcast TV history), it squeezes 6 or 7 episodes - 43 minutes each - onto each disc, resulting in heavy compression artifacts.
