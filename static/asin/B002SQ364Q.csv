1287314,A32GCOTGFJ9XC3,B002SQ364Q,"Alex Honda ""onyx575""","[2, 4]","I just got through watching the TAKING WOODSTOCK BLU-RAY and I must say that it looks outstanding on my Bravia TV. Maybe its because I don't have any movies on Blu-Ray that have been filmed in the past few years, they're either older or on DVD, but the picture and color is just breathtaking.The colors are vibrant and the definition is super sharp...even better than real life. I didn't see TAKING WOODSTOCK in the theater, so I don't know if the picture quality was the same, but it's really amazing on Blu-Ray. And the crowd shots are really cool, too.Anyway, the movie is based on a bookTaking Woodstockby Elliot Tiber (then Teichberg-he changed his name) about his involvement with helping the 1969 Woodstock concert happen. Elliot's parents owned a small, rundown motel in White Lake in Bethel, NY and he also happened to have a permit to put on a music and art festival. He was also neighbors with Max Yasgur who owned the land where the concert took place. So the movie captures the chaos that happens behind the historic concert and how Elliot's life changes as a result of the ""Aquarian Festival.""It follows the book, which is a fun read, pretty closely but it doesn't depict the Stonewall riots, which Tiber was also involved in, only hints at it in a phone call.I enjoyed the movie and I think Ang Lee captured the spirit of those three days, perfectly. The costume designer and prop/set designer/art director should win Academy Awards because you will swear that you are watching footage taken right from 1969. There were times when I wondered if they spliced film from the original documentaryWoodstock: 3 Days of Peace & Music Director's Cut (40th Anniversary Ultimate Collector's Edition)into some of the scenes, Lee uses a split screens at certain moments (like in the Woodstock Doc), because they look so authentic.The actors were all great but the stand outs were Imelda Staunton (Sonia Teichberg), who plays Elliot's overbearing Jewish mother. She's hilarious and would have made ""Sophia Petrillo"" on TV'sThe Golden Girls - The Complete First Seasonproud. Demetri Martin was good too--I never heard of him-- as Elliot Teichberg and Liev Schreiber, who makes a hideous drag queen, was warm and wonderful in his role as ""Vilma.""  Jonathan  Groff who plays ""Michael Lang"" (one of the producers of the Woodstock festival) didn't look too much like him but gave off his characteristics. If you've seen interviews with the real Lang, you'll know what I'm talking about. Lang has this way of speaking and this angelic quality about him and Groff captures that essence to the ""T."" Eugene Levy did an outstanding job portraying ""Max Yasgur,"" as well.The Blu-Ray has some extras on it:*** MY SCENES = this feature allows you to create your favorite scenes from the movie to playback when you want to see them again.*** 19:22-minute ""PEACE, LOVE AND CINEMA"" FEATURETTE = the real Michael Lang, Ang Lee and the stars of the movie talk about ""Woodstock"" and discuss the film. Great behind-the-scenes and you get to see the real Elliot Teichberg (Tiber), too.*** 3:47-minute ""NO AUDIENCE REQUIRED: THE EARTHLIGHT PLAYERS"" FEATURETTE = this is an interview with the actor who portrays the leader of the acting troupe in the movie.*** SIX DELETED SCENES (Play-All option) = shots that didn't make it in the film. Some of these scenes were in the book so you'll get a kick out of them if you've read it.*** FEATURE COMMENTARY = Ang Lee and screenwriter James Schamus.If you're expecting to see concert footage and etc., from the Woodstock concert this isn't the movie for you. Otherwise I highly recommend this film!",5,Great Story Behind Woodstock...*Gorgeous* Blu-Ray!,1264896000,"01 31, 2010",2010,3619,"['just', 'got', 'watching', 'TAKING', 'WOODSTOCK', 'BLU-RAY', 'must', 'say', 'outstanding', 'Bravia', 'TV', 'Maybe', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'movies', 'Blu-Ray', 'have', 'been', 'filmed', 'past', 'few', 'years', ""'re"", 'older', 'DVD', 'picture', 'color', 'just', 'breathtaking.The', 'colors', 'are', 'vibrant', 'definition', 'super', 'sharp', 'even', 'better', 'real', 'life', 'did', ""n't"", 'see', 'TAKING', 'WOODSTOCK', 'theater', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'picture', 'quality', 'was', 'same', 'really', 'amazing', 'Blu-Ray', 'crowd', 'shots', 'are', 'really', 'cool', 'too.Anyway', 'movie', 'based', 'bookTaking', 'Woodstockby', 'Elliot', 'Tiber', 'then', 'Teichberg-he', 'changed', 'name', 'involvement', 'helping', '1969', 'Woodstock', 'concert', 'happen', 'Elliot', 'parents', 'owned', 'small', 'rundown', 'motel', 'White', 'Lake', 'Bethel', 'NY', 'also', 'happened', 'have', 'permit', 'put', 'music', 'art', 'festival', 'was', 'also', 'neighbors', 'Max', 'Yasgur', 'who', 'owned', 'land', 'where', 'concert', 'took', 'place', 'movie', 'chaos', 'historic', 'concert', 'how', 'Elliot', 'life', 'changes', 'result', 'Aquarian', 'Festival', 'book', 'fun', 'read', 'pretty', 'closely', ""n't"", 'depict', 'Stonewall', 'riots', 'Tiber', 'was', 'also', 'involved', 'only', 'phone', 'call.I', 'enjoyed', 'movie', 'think', 'Ang', 'Lee', 'captured', 'spirit', 'three', 'days', 'perfectly', 'costume', 'designer', 'prop/set', 'designer/art', 'director', 'should', 'win', 'Academy', 'Awards', 'will', 'swear', 'are', 'watching', 'footage', 'taken', 'right', '1969', 'were', 'times', 'when', 'wondered', 'spliced', 'film', 'original', 'documentaryWoodstock', '3', 'Days', 'Peace', 'Music', 'Director', 'Cut', '40th', 'Anniversary', 'Ultimate', 'Collector', 'Edition', 'scenes', 'Lee', 'split', 'screens', 'certain', 'moments', 'Woodstock', 'Doc', 'look', 'so', 'authentic.The', 'actors', 'were', 'great', 'stand', 'outs', 'were', 'Imelda', 'Staunton', 'Sonia', 'Teichberg', 'who', 'Elliot', 'overbearing', 'Jewish', 'mother', 'hilarious', 'would', 'have', 'made', 'Sophia', 'Petrillo', ""TV'sThe"", 'Golden', 'Girls', 'Complete', 'First', 'Seasonproud', 'Demetri', 'Martin', 'was', 'good', 'too', 'never', 'heard', 'Elliot', 'Teichberg', 'Liev', 'Schreiber', 'who', 'hideous', 'drag', 'queen', 'was', 'warm', 'wonderful', 'role', 'Vilma', 'Jonathan', 'Groff', 'who', 'Michael', 'Lang', 'one', 'producers', 'Woodstock', 'festival', 'did', ""n't"", 'look', 'too', 'much', 'gave', 'off', 'characteristics', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'interviews', 'real', 'Lang', ""'ll"", 'know', 'what', ""'m"", 'talking', 'Lang', 'way', 'speaking', 'angelic', 'quality', 'Groff', 'essence', 'T.', 'Eugene', 'Levy', 'did', 'outstanding', 'job', 'portraying', 'Max', 'Yasgur', 'well.The', 'Blu-Ray', 'extras', '***', 'MY', 'SCENES', '=', 'feature', 'create', 'favorite', 'scenes', 'movie', 'playback', 'when', 'want', 'see', 'again', '***', '19:22-minute', 'PEACE', 'LOVE', 'AND', 'CINEMA', 'FEATURETTE', '=', 'real', 'Michael', 'Lang', 'Ang', 'Lee', 'stars', 'movie', 'talk', 'Woodstock', 'discuss', 'film', 'Great', 'behind-the-scenes', 'get', 'see', 'real', 'Elliot', 'Teichberg', 'Tiber', 'too', '***', '3:47-minute', 'NO', 'AUDIENCE', 'REQUIRED', 'EARTHLIGHT', 'PLAYERS', 'FEATURETTE', '=', 'interview', 'actor', 'who', 'leader', 'acting', 'troupe', 'movie', 'SIX', 'DELETED', 'SCENES', 'Play-All', 'option', 'shots', 'did', ""n't"", 'make', 'film', 'scenes', 'were', 'book', 'so', ""'ll"", 'get', 'kick', ""'ve"", 'read', '***', 'FEATURE', 'COMMENTARY', '=', 'Ang', 'Lee', 'screenwriter', 'James', 'Schamus.If', ""'re"", 'expecting', 'see', 'concert', 'footage', 'etc.', 'Woodstock', 'concert', ""n't"", 'movie', 'Otherwise', 'highly', 'recommend', 'film']",N/A
1287315,AGEIT17HENDIS,B002SQ364Q,Alfred Johnson,"[1, 1]","Okay, I confess, and confess so publicly, that while I am a certified proud member of the generation of '68, the political branch of that generation, I was not even remotely near Woodstock, New York on that fateful August weekend of 1969 when the myth of ""youth nation"" took on a certain substantive possibility that we might, after all, make a ""newer world."" Others may have regrets that they did not attend but I unlike non-attendee Joni Mitchell, whose words from her song Woodstock form part of the headline for this entry, and the others am not. I, actually, was heading elsewhere, heading hard elsewhere on the highway hitchhike road in search of the blue-pink great American West night that was another branch of that same experience. That experience I am very happy that I undertook, and have written about elsewhere.That said, we were, wherever we were, in those times, at least those of us who were fighting for some version of that ""newer world"" seeking, children of Woodstock. Maybe not that particular experience, after all half a million hardly exhausted the numbers who were ""searching"" in those days, but some experience be it another of the myriad musical festivals that took place in those years, or a communal living experience, or like me a highway hitchhike break-out in search of the great American West night, or just took a ""hit"" of dope or popped a pill that in earlier or later times would have been scorned. It is under that sign the renowned director Ang Lee has creatively taken a back story from those times, a back story centered on the locals rather than the rock stars or the ""hippie"" touristas associated with the name Woodstock, and meshed it with one of the locals' self-discovery in 2009, the 40th anniversary year of that event.Whatever Woodstock, the place, and its environs were after the festival invasion before that event it was a dying Catskills resort area and farmland. That resort idea is central to the story line here. The Catskills, in the old days, before there was more widespread assimilation and Jews began to be accepted in other locales was always associated with the place where they went for vacation and as a ""proving ground"" for up and coming Jewish entertainers. By 1969 that idea, and those places, were pass&eacute;. However, not everybody got the word, especially not an old Jewish couple who were hanging on to their mortgaged to the hilt motel for dear life, despite the best efforts of their assimilated son, the central character, of the film.They did hold, or rather he held, an important asset: permits to allow the festival to go on. The story, the Woodstock and self-discovery story, take off from that point as we view the trials and tribulations of producing this spectacle, its actual occurrence, and the sometimes funny experiences that mother, father, and son experience, including the mandatory drug experimentation, sex (hetero and homosexual), and rock `n' roll. Is this the definitive study on Woodstock, on the 1960s counterculture, and on the generation of '68s jail break-out? No, hell no, but it is a very nicely done slice-of-life film around that seminal 1960s event.

1287323,A18G7GG53G2X8A,B002SQ364Q,Chris Pandolfi,"[5, 7]","It's strange, watching a movie about a time you never lived in, a culture you don't understand, and music you never listened to. I may be unqualified to review Ang Lee's ""Taking Woodstock,"" which tells the story of how that legendary concert came to be in the summer of 1969. As someone who wasn't yet born when it took place, I can't say that I related to anything being depicted onscreen. All I can say is, as a story with characters, I found it very entertaining. It focuses very little on the concert itself, but that's okay because Lee wasn't trying to recreate the ""Woodstock"" documentary released in 1970; he wanted nothing more than to present a light-hearted romp about the people who made Woodstock happen. He succeeded for the most part, even with the occasional lapse into contrived comedy.Having gone broke in New York City, interior designer Elliot Teichberg (Demetri Martin) moves back home to the Catskills of Upstate New York, where his parents operate a failing, dilapidated motel. When he hears that a neighboring town refused to give a permit to organizers of a music festival, he offers the organizers a permit of his own, which he obtained by being the president of the Bethel Chamber of Commerce. He and the head organizer, the always relaxed Michael Lang (Jonathan Groff), then strike up a deal with local dairy farmer Max Yasgur (Eugene Levy), who agrees to provide his own acreage as concert space. Knowing that this venue could potentially attract thousands of people, Michael buys out the Teichbergs' motel for the entire season. At last, Elliot and his family are making real money. Of course, they still have to cope with hippie overcrowding, protesting locals, and other technical and emotional woes.This relatively simple plot is livened up with a slew of side characters. Elliot's mother, Sonia (Imelda Staunton), is a Jewish Russian immigrant so desperate to avoid poverty that she doesn't realize how her actions have been harming the motel. His father, Jake (Henry Goodman), also an immigrant, has long since come to believe that throwing in the towel is the only way to deal with his wife. Elliot's best friend is Billy (Emile Hirsh), a Vietnam veteran who shows signs of Post Traumatic Stress Disorder. A contemporary theater troupe, led by Devon (Dan Fogler), lives in the Teichbergs' barn and occasionally perform at one of Elliot's own ""festivals,"" which consist of nothing more than playing a classical record (although he does hope to attract a string quartet). Devon and his actors know how to make a lasting impression; they end practically every performance by stripping naked and dancing. Probably the most interesting side character is Vilma (Liev Schreiber), a transvestite ex-marine who volunteers as Elliot's chief of security.I probably would have enjoyed ""Taking Woodstock"" more had I been emotionally invested. But that's hard to accomplish when you don't have the first clue about what it was like to live in the 1960s. I saw this movie with my father, and while he never had the chance to attend Woodstock, he did have some experience with the culture. With that in mind, he assured me that this movie was a fairly accurate depiction of the era. There was, in fact, one joke I could relate to and found funny. As Elliot and Max survey the fields during construction, Max recalls witnessing a serious act of greed: ""I saw someone charging a dollar to fill a water bottle. A dollar. For water. Can you believe it?""All cultural and generational gaps aside, the film is an enjoyable experience, at times because of its depth of character, at times because of its visual components. There's one great shot, for example, of Elliot riding on the back of a policeman's motorcycle through an impossibly long line of people making their way towards the concert; it's difficult to say whether or not this shot relied on CGI, especially as it widens to reveal how far the line of people extends, but I can say that, whatever techniques were employed, it was powerful, direct, and just a little bit funny. An obvious use of CGI can be found in the scene involving Elliot and a stamp of LSD. At one point, Elliot observes the crowd camped along the hills, which in this case are brightly colored and literally rolling, like waves. In some scenes, Lee relies on the same technique he utilized in ""Hulk,"" in which the screen is split into comic book panels. This is effective, but when you have three different conversations going on at the same time, it can also be distracting.There are a few things left unexplained. The issue of Elliot's sexuality, for example, is alluded to so delicately and infrequently it's curious why it was deemed a necessary subplot. There's really no way to account for Michael Lang, who's so easy going and confident that it's hard to take him seriously, especially when he bases his decisions on good vibes. And I can't say I appreciated the aftermath of Elliot's parents eating marijuana-laced brownies. Rather than going for something genuine, the scene instead goes for desperate, broad comedy, which goes double for Elliot's mother since she's usually a hotheaded worrywart. But on the whole, ""Taking Woodstock"" is a pleasant movie with fun characters and a decent story. I'm sure older generations who understand 1960s culture and know more about Woodstock will also enjoy this movie, probably more than I did.",4,"What This Town Needs is Three Days of Peace, Love, and

1287324,A30N4CJVI6U4XE,B002SQ364Q,"Chris Wilson ""Chris Kent""","[2, 2]","Recapturing the spirit of Woodstock, the legendary 1969 rock music festival in Bethel, New York, must have been a daunting task for director Ang Lee's 2009 film ""Taking Woodstock."" You have to battle overwhelming myth while recreating a moment of surreal magic 40 years down the road. Lee succeeds with a wonderful, often times comedic outsider's view on the edges of the enormous festival. It's a tremendous accomplishment.Only a few filmmakers as brave as Lee (Brokeback Mountain (Widescreen Edition),The Ice Storm) would have tackled this story. First and foremost, you must muscle to the top of a tall, muddy hill to stand alongside the brilliant, Oscar-winning documentaryWoodstock: 3 Days of Peace & Music Director's Cut (40th Anniversary Two-Disc Special Edition). Lee essentially joins forces, utilizing similar split screens, faded color stock and recreating several famous moments (nuns flashing peace signs, the couple wrapped in an American flag, the Port-O-San man). Secondly, you're making a film that, while intricately woven into the festival's fabric, rarely takes place near the music. Ultimately, it's an Altmanesque slice of life and one of my favorite films of 2009.Based on Elliot Tiber's bookTaking Woodstock, the film details what is primarily a true story of youthful Elliot (Demetri Martin) living at his parents' rundown homestead in Bethel. Days are spent trying to keep his parents' dilapidated hotel afloat while serving as the timid president of the chamber of commerce. A dreary existence, he's trapped by loyalty to an oppressive mother (Imelda Staunton), disinterested dad (Henry Goodman) and a local banker threatening foreclosure. When Tiber reads about a neighboring rock music festival losing its permit, he fatefully decides to give promoter Michael Lang (The Road to Woodstock) a call. Tiber hopes that by hosting the festival, he can get his parents' hotel out of hock and thus, the seeds of Woodstock are planted.Within days, the Tiber hotel becomes the frantic headquarters for concert organizers, helicopters regularly landing in the yard, and Lang himself (wonderfully played by Jonathan Groff) striking up a friendship. Tiber is the straight man amidst chaos, viewing parades of hippies and businessmen from afar. He's our navigator through history and on the verge of coming-of-age. In reality, Tiber was a closeted homosexual and credits Woodstock with allowing him to embrace his sexuality. This is faintly touched upon, though never with satisfying detail. He has a crush on a burly stage builder, and they steal a momentary kiss. A former marine-turned transvestite Vilma appears (Liev Schreiber, excellent as usual), serving as the unlikely Tiber protecting angel.When the festival begins, the film has several unforgettable moments -  a pond where nude bathers relax as the first distant chords of Richie Havens' ""Freedom"" (Best of) floats on the summer breeze; Elliot catching a ride with a motorcycle policeman and riding through massive throngs of cars and hippies in a brilliant continuous take; and an impromptu stop at a VW bus overlooking the distant stage. These are the films most extraordinary scenes as introverted Tiber becomes one with the largest youth gathering in American history (they say 400,000, but who knows?). It's an intimate view of an epic setting, as he resides in the comfort of the VW bus, staring at a ceiling of psychedelic paintings. Slowly, after dropping acid for the first time, the artwork, not to mention the gregarious California hippie couple (Paul Dano and Kelli Garner) begin to glow and move, and they lovingly embrace, laugh and partake in this incredible moment in time. As Tiber steps outside the bus at nightfall, the land is marked by hundreds of campfires surrounding the stage. Tiber dances as the star-studded sky becomes one with the land, and you realize in this tearfully beautiful scene, Lee has captured the Woodstock moment.I found several of the dramas eventually playing out to be abrupt and clumsy. I would have liked more closure with Schreiber's Vilma, not to mention Max Yasgur (Eugene Levy). These crucial supporting characters essentially disappear and Tiber's homosexuality is also forgotten. So while ""Taking Woodstock"" is a maddeningly imperfect film lacking a poetic conclusion, it is a creative companion to the famous documentary. Lee succeeds against enormous odds, creating a valentine work embracing an extraordinary collage of spiritual freedom.",4,Intimate view of an epic setting,1289606400,"11 13, 2010",2010,4472,"['Recapturing', 'spirit', 'Woodstock', 'legendary', '1969', 'rock', 'music', 'festival', 'Bethel', 'New', 'York', 'must', 'have', 'been', 'daunting', 'task', 'director', 'Ang', 'Lee', '2009', 'film', 'Taking', 'Woodstock', 'have', 'battle', 'overwhelming', 'myth', 'recreating', 'moment', 'surreal', 'magic', '40', 'years', 'road', 'Lee', 'wonderful', 'often', 'comedic', 'outsider', 'view', 'edges', 'enormous', 'festival', 'tremendous', 'accomplishment.Only', 'few', 'filmmakers', 'as', 'brave', 'Lee', 'Brokeback', 'Mountain', 'Widescreen', 'Edition', 'Ice', 'Storm', 'would', 'have', 'tackled', 'story', 'First', 'foremost', 'must', 'muscle', 'top', 'tall', 'muddy', 'hill', 'stand', 'brilliant', 'Oscar-winning', 'documentaryWoodstock', '3', 'Days', 'Peace', 'Music', 'Director', 'Cut', '40th', 'Anniversary', 'Two-Disc', 'Special', 'Edition', 'Lee', 'essentially', 'forces', 'utilizing', 'similar', 'split', 'screens', 'faded', 'color', 'stock', 'recreating', 'several', 'famous', 'moments', 'nuns', 'flashing', 'peace', 'signs', 'couple', 'wrapped', 'American', 'flag', 'Port-O-San', 'man', 'Secondly', ""'re"", 'making', 'film', 'intricately', 'woven', 'festival', 'fabric', 'rarely', 'place', 'music', 'Ultimately', 'Altmanesque', 'slice', 'life', 'one', 'favorite', 'films', '2009.Based', 'Elliot', 'Tiber', 'bookTaking', 'Woodstock', 'film', 'details', 'what', 'primarily', 'true', 'story', 'youthful', 'Elliot', 'Demetri', 'Martin', 'living', 'parents', 'rundown', 'homestead', 'Bethel', 'Days', 'are', 'spent', 'trying', 'keep', 'parents', 'dilapidated', 'hotel', 'afloat', 'serving', 'timid', 'president', 'chamber', 'commerce', 'dreary', 'existence', 'trapped', 'loyalty', 'oppressive', 'mother', 'Imelda', 'Staunton', 'disinterested', 'dad', 'Henry', 'Goodman', 'local', 'banker', 'threatening', 'foreclosure', 'When', 'Tiber', 'neighboring', 'rock', 'music', 'festival', 'losing', 'permit', 'fatefully', 'give', 'promoter', 'Michael', 'Lang', 'Road', 'Woodstock', 'call', 'Tiber', 'hosting', 'festival', 'can', 'get', 'parents', 'hotel', 'hock', 'thus', 'seeds', 'Woodstock', 'are', 'planted.Within', 'days', 'Tiber', 'hotel', 'frantic', 'headquarters', 'concert', 'organizers', 'helicopters', 'regularly', 'landing', 'yard', 'Lang', 'wonderfully', 'played', 'Jonathan', 'Groff', 'striking', 'up', 'friendship', 'Tiber', 'straight', 'man', 'amidst', 'chaos', 'viewing', 'parades', 'hippies', 'businessmen', 'afar', 'navigator', 'history', 'verge', 'coming-of-age', 'reality', 'Tiber', 'was', 'closeted', 'homosexual', 'credits', 'Woodstock', 'allowing', 'embrace', 'sexuality', 'faintly', 'touched', 'upon', 'never', 'satisfying', 'detail', 'crush', 'burly', 'stage', 'builder', 'steal', 'momentary', 'kiss', 'former', 'marine-turned', 'transvestite', 'Vilma', 'Liev', 'Schreiber', 'excellent', 'usual', 'serving', 'unlikely', 'Tiber', 'protecting', 'festival', 'film', 'several', 'unforgettable', 'moments', 'pond', 'where', 'nude', 'bathers', 'relax', 'first', 'distant', 'chords', 'Richie', 'Havens', 'Freedom', 'Best', 'floats', 'summer', 'breeze', 'Elliot', 'catching', 'ride', 'motorcycle', 'policeman', 'riding', 'massive', 'throngs', 'cars', 'hippies', 'brilliant', 'continuous', 'take', 'impromptu', 'stop', 'VW', 'bus', 'overlooking', 'distant', 'stage', 'are', 'films', 'most', 'extraordinary', 'scenes', 'introverted', 'Tiber', 'one', 'largest', 'youth', 'gathering', 'American', 'history', 'say', '400,000', 'who', 'intimate', 'view', 'epic', 'setting', 'comfort', 'VW', 'bus', 'staring', 'ceiling', 'psychedelic', 'paintings', 'Slowly', 'dropping', 'acid', 'first', 'time', 'artwork', 'not', 'mention', 'gregarious', 'California', 'hippie', 'couple', 'Paul', 'Dano', 'Kelli', 'Garner', 'begin', 'glow', 'move', 'lovingly', 'embrace', 'laugh', 'partake', 'incredible', 'moment', 'time', 'Tiber', 'steps', 'bus', 'nightfall', 'land', 'marked', 'hundreds', 'campfires', 'surrounding', 'stage', 'Tiber', 'star-studded', 'sky', 'one', 'land', 'realize', 'tearfully', 'beautiful', 'scene', 'Lee', 'captured', 'Woodstock', 'moment.I', 'found', 'several', 'dramas', 'eventually', 'playing', 'out', 'be', 'abrupt', 'clumsy', 'would', 'have', 'liked', 'more', 'closure', 'Schreiber', 'Vilma', 'not', 'mention', 'Max', 'Yasgur', 'Eugene', 'Levy', 'crucial', 'supporting', 'characters', 'essentially', 'disappear', 'Tiber', 'homosexuality', 'also', 'forgotten', 'So', 'Taking', 'Woodstock', 'maddeningly', 'imperfect', 'film', 'lacking', 'poetic', 'conclusion', 'creative', 'companion', 'famous', 'documentary', 'Lee', 'enormous', 'odds', 'creating', 'valentine', 'work', 'embracing', 'extraordinary', 'collage', 'spiritual', 'freedom']",N/A
1287325,AEQFYOI6YJ83Z,B002SQ364Q,DanD,"[0, 0]","In a film about Woodstock, we expect two things: great music, or deep meditations about humanity and coming together.  ""Taking Woodstock"" doesn't really give us either.  This is NOT a film about the concert--it's a film about ESTABLISHING the concert, which trust me is a very different thing entirely.  We don't hear the music, we don't see the acts--this is a film about the young man (Elliot Tiber) who sees the opportunity to bring some revenue and culture to his small New York hometown.I'm not criticizing ""Taking Woodstock"" for it's lack of music; the film stands solidly enough on its own, though there will be obvious viewers who expected something a little more formulaic.  What I AM criticizing the film for--and, really, the only criticism I have, though it's a big one--is its lack of depth.  It is a pleasant viewing experience, but doesn't come off as overly memorable.  Even Liev Schreiber in drag, as funny and pitch-perfect as he is, comes off as rather ho-hum in the grand scheme of things.The best thing about the film is the performances, which are strong all-around.  Demetri Martin proves he's more than just a funny man in the lead role, providing a near-flawless performance.  He's helped along by some great supporting roles: Schreiber as a gun-toting cross-dresser; Emile Hirsch as a Vietnam vet; Paul Dano in what is probably one of the more random film cameos; the ever-reliable Eugene Levy as the farmer who loans his land for the event; Jonathan Groff as concert promoter Michael Lang; and especially Henry Goodman and Imelda Staunton as (respectively) Elliot's caring-but-tough father and extremely thrifty mother.  The latter risks being a stereotype, but we don't care--Staunton is so enjoyable in the role, it's worth the risk.Overall, ""Taking Woodstock"" is definitely a film to see, if you like this kind of thing.  Lee gets a little too creative with the camera work at times--the multiple screens and documentary-style footage come off as hokey--but most of the film looks stunning, with solid cinematography.  Elliot's sexuality seems more of an afterthought.  The film should either focus more upon it, or ignore it completely; we get the sense that, after ""Brokeback Mountain,"" Lee feels compelled to address the subject, but too afraid to make another ""gay"" picture, leading to a tediousness that the actors handle well enough, but weighs down the story at spots.

Von Behren ""reneofc""","[1, 2]","In ""Taking Woodstock,"" director Ang Lee sweetly adapts Elliot Tiber's memoir of the same name to tell a small coming-of-age tale amidst the larger backdrop of the behind the scenes coming together of the 1969 Woodstock Music Festival at Yasgur's farm in upstate New York after town residents of the original venue in Wallkill passed a law banning the gathering of over 5000 people without the appropriate permit.  Possessing a permit to sponsor a small music and arts festival at the site of his parents' rundown motel, El Monaco, Tiber a.k.a Teichberg, immediately contacted concert organizers Michael Lang and Artie Kornfield and the rest, as they say, is history.Billed as ""three days of peace and music"" meant to heal a nation suffering from the ongoing effects of the Vietnam War and the aftershock of the assignations of Bobby Kennedy and Martin Luther King, Woodstock historically served its purpose for the hundreds of thousands that participated.  Like America of that time period, Lee's main character Elliot (an unassuming and quickly forgotten Demetri Martin), hears a clarion call of his own; after living openly in Greenwich Village as a gay male, he must hide his sexual orientation from his Holocaust survivor parents when he moves back to Bethel, New York to save their motel.  Now he must bite the bullet, rebuke the excuse of handling his parents and their issues and find a life of his own.Lee's theme toys with different ideas of freedom whose apt anthem is the opening concert piece by Richie Havens.  For Elliot's mother (played with an almost Gestapo intensity by Imelda Staunton,) it materializes in the form of thousands of hoarded banknotes signifying the security of which she has always dreamed.  The senior Teichberg (Henry Goodman) finds enjoyment in a newfound energy generated by the `young people' that invade the town, listen to his life stories and applaud his functional gravitas. The preparation, three days and aftermath heal lost Vietnam vet Billy (Emile Hirsch), allow Marine cross-dresser Vilma (Liev Schreiber) to control his confused life for a limited amount of time while assuming an oracle role to the other misfits this film brings together, and provide the westward-ho direction for a newly enlightened and empowered Elliot.  Once again, it takes a village . . .. . . of which some of its inhabitants border on the stereotypical or add nothing to the film other than to provide an entire entourage of sixties characters complete with an Oh! Calcutta! type theatre group that revels in their nudity, a couple of acid droppers in a old VW bus decorated with requisite kaleidoscopic ceiling graphics and angry burgeoning feminists intent on a ritual bra-burning.  All of which add layer upon layer onto a fairly satisfying 40 year old glimpse of reality that Lee obviously took pains to achieve.All of the extras look as if they are from that era with their emphasis on untamed manes of hair (shades ofHair) free of any of the meticulous grooming products so prevalent now--the skinny dipping scenes emphasis this most of all with their blatant display of non-depilatoried body hair suggesting the feral freedom of Rousseau's noble savage so prevalent to that mindset.Concentrating wholeheartedly on reconstructing his main character's microcosm, Lee steers the storyline away from an emphasis on the concert itself, offering only a hilltop vantage point of the stage with its undulating sea of people that pulses and glows from the perspective of an acid trip.  Healing, indeed as are other signs of the time--peace signs, tie dye, fringed vests, floppy leather hats, tokes of maryjane and gobbles of hash brownies.Bottom line:  Ang Lee does a nice job of depicting upstate New York in the late sixties when Woodstock came to town.  Instead of concentrating on the concert and its music, he tells a smaller tale of family salvation fueled by the material wealth the festival brought with it and the Age of Aquarian ideals that bespoke a new millennium of desired peace and the main character's self-acceptance.  Some stereotypes reign along with a rather weak lead by Demetri Martin, but Lee pulls it off like the pro he is, recreating a nice facsimile of the venue and its time.  Many of the film's references (i.e. organizer Lang's hopeful plans to head to San Francisco refer to the role he played in putting together the Altamont Music Festival where the a chapter of Hell's Angels hired to run security ended up stabbing and killing someone and beating up a lot of hippies with pool cues and the Judy Garland record played in the El Monaco bar supposedly refers to the Stonewall riots in Greenwich village, heralding the beginning of the Gay Liberation Movement) needed at least textual explanations for those unfamiliar with the era and its incendiary history. Recommended--however, if you want to hear the music, buy the CDMusic from the Original Soundtrack and More: Woodstockor watch the documentaryWoodstock: 3 Days of Peace & Music Director's Cut (40th

Elliot Tiber, the real life individual, must be more interesting than Demetri Martin plays him, else why make a movie based on his experiences?

Still, Taking Woodstock did not even come close to my hopes for this film. The plot centers around the character of Jake Teichberg and the motel that his mother and father own. The motel has been sitting vacant for years and the family is in jeopardy of losing the place to the bank. In a certain twist of fate, Jake discovers that a music festival has been turned away by two towns in upstate New York. He is able to secure a permit to have the music festival held in his own town of Bethel. Suddenly, the producers of the festival and their staff are lowered into Bethel by helicopter. With them come thousands of audience members who inundate the sheltered town with hoards of hippies. During this historic event, Jake is battling with himself and his family over his need to leave his hometown and secure a future for himself elsewhere. Though Jake never actually gets to see Woodstock or any of the singers who performed, he does meet his first transvestite, smokes his first joint, and trips on acid. Though he basically missed the entire event that he helped save, he comes out the other side an adult.Though it sounds like a great premise, the way that the director (Ang Lee) actually created the film made it drab and boring. Jake came off as being an extremely sheltered, neurotic, and whiny boy who was caught between his own life and that of his parent's. It is clear that his relationship with his parents created a great amount of stress for him, but his personality made it almost impossible to root for him. In addition, the characterization of the audience members was entirely one-sided. While the town laughed at them and called them hippies, Ang Lee did not do anything as a director to make the audience feel differently. The only character that was in the least bit dynamic was the transvestite Vilma who was played by Liev Schreider. Even Lee's portrayal of concert producer Michael Lang seemed one-dimensional with Lang being the sage-like hippie who spoke almost like Yoda. Perhaps the most upsetting, is that because Jake never gets to witness any of the actual festival neither does the audience! To add insult to injury, none of the music from Woodstock was even played in the movie. Basically, this is a film about Woodstock without any elements of Woodstock included in it. Overall, it was a huge bust and I believe that Woodstock experts and novices will find this film to be greatly disappointing.",2,huge disappointment for a 1960s fan,1274313600,"05 20, 2010",2010,2538,"['huge', 'fan', '1960s', 'music', 'history', 'culture', 'have', 'admit', 'expectations', 'were', 'bit', 'high', 'Still', 'Taking', 'Woodstock', 'did', 'not', 'even', 'come', 'close', 'hopes', 'film', 'plot', 'centers', 'character', 'Jake', 'Teichberg', 'motel', 'mother', 'father', 'own', 'motel', 'been', 'sitting', 'vacant', 'years', 'family', 'jeopardy', 'losing', 'place', 'bank', 'certain', 'twist', 'fate', 'Jake', 'music', 'festival', 'been', 'turned', 'away', 'two', 'towns', 'upstate', 'New', 'York', 'able', 'secure', 'permit', 'have', 'music', 'festival', 'held', 'own', 'town', 'Bethel', 'Suddenly', 'producers', 'festival', 'staff', 'are', 'lowered', 'Bethel', 'helicopter', 'come', 'thousands', 'audience', 'members', 'who', 'inundate', 'sheltered', 'town', 'hoards', 'hippies', 'historic', 'event', 'Jake', 'battling', 'family', 'need', 'leave', 'hometown', 'secure', 'future', 'elsewhere', 'Jake', 'never', 'actually', 'see', 'Woodstock', 'singers', 'who', 'performed', 'meet', 'first', 'transvestite', 'smokes', 'first', 'joint', 'trips', 'acid', 'basically', 'missed', 'entire', 'event', 'helped', 'save', 'out', 'other', 'side', 'great', 'premise', 'way', 'director', 'Ang', 'Lee', 'actually', 'created', 'film', 'made', 'drab', 'boring', 'Jake', 'came', 'off', 'being', 'extremely', 'sheltered', 'neurotic', 'whiny', 'boy', 'who', 'was', 'caught', 'own', 'life', 'parent', 'clear', 'relationship', 'parents', 'created', 'great', 'amount', 'stress', 'personality', 'made', 'almost', 'impossible', 'root', 'addition', 'characterization', 'audience', 'members', 'was', 'entirely', 'one-sided', 'town', 'laughed', 'called', 'hippies', 'Ang', 'Lee', 'did', 'not', 'do', 'anything', 'director', 'make', 'audience', 'feel', 'differently', 'only', 'character', 'was', 'least', 'bit', 'dynamic', 'was', 'transvestite', 'Vilma', 'who', 'was', 'played', 'Liev', 'Schreider', 'Even', 'Lee', 'portrayal', 'concert', 'producer', 'Michael', 'Lang', 'seemed', 'one-dimensional', 'Lang', 'being', 'sage-like', 'hippie', 'who', 'spoke', 'almost', 'Yoda', 'Perhaps', 'most', 'upsetting', 'Jake', 'never', 'witness', 'actual', 'festival', 'neither', 'audience', 'add', 'insult', 'injury', 'none', 'music', 'Woodstock', 'was', 'even', 'played', 'movie', 'Basically', 'film', 'Woodstock', 'elements', 'Woodstock', 'included', 'Overall', 'was', 'huge', 'bust', 'believe', 'Woodstock', 'experts', 'novices', 'will', 'find', 'film', 'be', 'greatly', 'disappointing']",N/A

For instance...Elliot WAS responsible for bringing Woodstock Ventures to his home town but he did NOT introduce Micheal Lang to his neighbor, Max Yasgur. These are trivial concerns. Watch the movie for it's entertainment value and you won't be disappointed. It's a charming and heartfelt comedy, that if you just let your mind go, will bring you right back to that wonderful summer in 1969.One thing in particular, that I just HAVE to mention, is that there is one scene in the movie that is the most REAL depiction of an acid trip, that I have EVER seen, committed to film! And if you've ever taken really good acid, like what we had back in the 60's, I'm sure you'll agree with me. Nothing &#34;over the top&#34; or unbelieveable hallucinations, that are so often depicted in movies. This is just a great trip! Very natural. Ang Lee nailed it! (The scene takes place when Elliot first gets to the festival site and meets up with a couple of kids who are just sitting by their VW minibus. They drop acid, crawl inside the minibus  and...bye bye reality.)It's not vital but it is a good idea to watch &#34;Woodstock: Three Days Of Peace And Music&#34;, before you watch this movie.

1287336,A2OU415LB9I5J6,B002SQ364Q,Jason C. Wilkerson,"[1, 2]","Based on a true story, Taking Woodstock follows the story of Elliot Tiechberg (Demetri Martin), who helps his parents (Imelda Staunton and Henry Goodman) with their failing motel in the Catskills. Out of money as he's fueled it into the motel to keep it running, he finds an opportunity in bringing Woodstock to the Catskills after it's been kicked out of it's original home, and a deal for it to appear in a neighboring town falls through. Faced with opposition, Elliot procedes to bring Woodstock to the Catskills, an opportunity that changes his life, and his relationship with his parents.Ang Lee, as well as his frequent collaborator James Schamus, have carved out a niche for themselves creating art house dramas based on around the central theme of outsiders trying to find their place in a world that's constantly changing around them. To be honest, I have never been a big fan of Lee's, from Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon to Hulk to Brokeback Mountain I've always found him to be slightly overrated even if he does pull great performances from his actors. From the first previews of Taking Woodstock I have to say that I wondered whether his newest film would be the one to turn me around.Honestly, I have to say that I have to say that I really enjoyed Lee's newest film. Now don't get me wrong, even with Brokeback Mountain I didn't find myself impressed, but it was not because of the ""message"" of the film, I just felt that the story of a forbidden relationship in the midst of changing and turbulent times has been done before and has been done better. With his other films, I just found them lacking, but with this one it felt a little closer to home than what I'm used to from Lee. The typical problem with Lee is that the issue in his movies is a bit bigger than people seem to realize that their problems actually are. In this case though, the comedy alleviates the issues and actually allows you to feel with the issues of the movie.Another thing that really adds to this movie is the acting. No one really stands out, everyone just fits in their posts. Demetri Martin, best known currently running Comedy Central show delivers a very understated performance as Elliot, as does Eugene Levy in the role of Max Yasgur, the man who allows Woodstock to play on his land. Once again, Liev Schreiber dons drag for his role in this film as he did in Mixed Nuts (and steals the movie in drag as he did in Mixed Nuts as well). But one of the great things here is the fact that no one really stands out, everyone shines or blends together.Honestly, though, and this is awkward for a Lee film, this flick begins to feel a little scattered. The first act is fairly tight, but as time goes on the film begins to feel less taut. But the third act it seems to unravel, not just in the form of the characters lives unraveling, but because the film itself unraveling. One particular instance of this is a subplot that reveals Elliot is gay, but it is never spoken. I would typically not argue about this if a film made it clear, but it's never truly mentioned in the film, you just catch a moment where Elliot makes out with a woman then a man and then later on in the film he wakes up with a man in bed with him. In my opinion it really just seems that Elliot is bi-sexual in the film, but in life the real Elliot is a homosexual. It would seem to me that the film should have done a better job of portraying him as so, as well as portraying other things throughout the film.All in all, I enjoyed this film. It's not a great film, but it's not a horrible film either. If you're interested in Woodstock, and what went on behind the scenes rather than just the concert itself and how lives were affected I highly recommend this film. If you're looking for films in the vein of other Ang Lee movies this might not be the film for you though overall. Either way I recommend you at least give it a try, in my honest opinion it's a lot of fun.3/5",3,Taking Woodstock,1275177600,"05 30, 2010",2010,3944,"['Based', 'true', 'story', 'Taking', 'Woodstock', 'story', 'Elliot', 'Tiechberg', 'Demetri', 'Martin', 'who', 'parents', 'Imelda', 'Staunton', 'Henry', 'Goodman', 'failing', 'motel', 'Catskills', 'Out', 'money', 'fueled', 'motel', 'keep', 'running', 'opportunity', 'bringing', 'Woodstock', 'Catskills', 'been', 'kicked', 'original', 'home', 'deal', 'appear', 'neighboring', 'town', 'Faced', 'opposition', 'Elliot', 'bring', 'Woodstock', 'Catskills', 'opportunity', 'life', 'relationship', 'parents.Ang', 'Lee', 'as', 'well', 'frequent', 'collaborator', 'James', 'Schamus', 'have', 'carved', 'out', 'niche', 'creating', 'art', 'house', 'dramas', 'based', 'central', 'theme', 'outsiders', 'trying', 'find', 'place', 'world', 'constantly', 'changing', 'be', 'honest', 'have', 'never', 'been', 'big', 'fan', 'Lee', 'Crouching', 'Tiger', 'Hidden', 'Dragon', 'Hulk', 'Brokeback', 'Mountain', ""'ve"", 'always', 'found', 'be', 'slightly', 'overrated', 'even', 'pull', 'great', 'performances', 'actors', 'first', 'previews', 'Taking', 'Woodstock', 'have', 'say', 'wondered', 'newest', 'film', 'would', 'be', 'one', 'turn', 'around.Honestly', 'have', 'say', 'have', 'say', 'really', 'enjoyed', 'Lee', 'newest', 'film', 'Now', 'do', ""n't"", 'get', 'wrong', 'even', 'Brokeback', 'Mountain', 'did', ""n't"", 'find', 'impressed', 'was', 'not', 'message', 'film', 'just', 'felt', 'story', 'forbidden', 'relationship', 'midst', 'changing', 'turbulent', 'times', 'been', 'done', 'before', 'been', 'done', 'better', 'other', 'films', 'just', 'found', 'lacking', 'one', 'felt', 'little', 'closer', 'home', 'what', ""'m"", 'used', 'Lee', 'typical', 'problem', 'Lee', 'issue', 'movies', 'bit', 'bigger', 'people', 'seem', 'realize', 'problems', 'actually', 'are', 'case', 'comedy', 'issues', 'actually', 'feel', 'issues', 'movie.Another', 'thing', 'really', 'movie', 'acting', 'one', 'really', 'out', 'everyone', 'just', 'fits', 'posts', 'Demetri', 'Martin', 'best', 'known', 'currently', 'running', 'Comedy', 'Central', 'show', 'very', 'understated', 'performance', 'Elliot', 'Eugene', 'Levy', 'role', 'Max', 'Yasgur', 'man', 'who', 'Woodstock', 'play', 'land', 'Once', 'again', 'Liev', 'Schreiber', 'dons', 'drag', 'role', 'film', 'did', 'Mixed', 'Nuts', 'movie', 'drag', 'did', 'Mixed', 'Nuts', 'as', 'well', 'one', 'great', 'things', 'here', 'fact', 'one', 'really', 'out', 'everyone', 'shines', 'blends', 'together.Honestly', 'awkward', 'Lee', 'film', 'flick', 'feel', 'little', 'scattered', 'first', 'act', 'fairly', 'tight', 'time', 'film', 'feel', 'less', 'taut', 'third', 'act', 'unravel', 'not', 'just', 'form', 'characters', 'unraveling', 'film', 'unraveling', 'One', 'particular', 'instance', 'subplot', 'reveals', 'Elliot', 'gay', 'never', 'spoken', 'would', 'typically', 'not', 'argue', 'film', 'made', 'clear', 'never', 'truly', 'mentioned', 'film', 'just', 'catch', 'moment', 'where', 'Elliot', 'out', 'woman', 'then', 'man', 'then', 'later', 'film', 'up', 'man', 'bed', 'opinion', 'really', 'just', 'Elliot', 'bi-sexual', 'film', 'life', 'real', 'Elliot', 'homosexual', 'would', 'seem', 'film', 'should', 'have', 'done', 'better', 'job', 'portraying', 'so', 'as', 'well', 'portraying', 'other', 'things', 'film.All', 'enjoyed', 'film', 'not', 'great', 'film', 'not', 'horrible', 'film', 'either', ""'re"", 'interested', 'Woodstock', 'went', 'scenes', 'rather', 'just', 'concert', 'how', 'lives', 'were', 'affected', 'highly', 'recommend', 'film', ""'re"", 'looking', 'films', 'vein', 'other', 'Ang', 'Lee', 'movies', 'might', 'not', 'be', 'film', 'overall', 'way', 'recommend', 'least', 'give', 'try', 'honest', 'opinion', 'lot', 'fun.3/5']",N/A

I'm not sure how much was truth and how much was made up.  I do know that they had some scenes that were based on pictures from the Woodstock festival.  So if you are interested in stuff like that, you will probably be happy.  I think one of the people that actually had something to do with Woodstock helped with the movie.  The movie is about the guy who was a big part of Woodstock actually happening.  How Woodstock was stopped, then thanks to him and his family, it still got to be what is was.I learned things that I never had any idea about before.  So for that, I'm happy.  It was a fun movie to watch.  Well at parts.  There were interesting parts, then out of no where, it would just drag on and on.  Seems like it could be amazing.  Only if they had written more stuff to keep you awake.  I know the movie wasn't about the music from Woodstock.  But I only heard a few songs.  Hopefully the soundtrack is better.  I guess you could just buy the Woodstock DVD though.  It's weird to think that something like Woodstock will probably never happen again. I mean, didn't people riot at the last Woodstock?

1287340,AJX8Q5CKA59DJ,B002SQ364Q,"JournalStone ""Duncan Moron""","[3, 3]","""Taking Woodstock"" is one of those films I could have easily missed.  I had no desire to see it, and it was only by chance that I ended up catching it OnDemand.  I can only say, as far as movies go, that I am very pleased I happened across it.  The movie was a fantastic depiction of the behind the scenes story leading up to the monumental event which has become infamous.  This might be the only concert in history that literally, on its own, defines a specific decade and what life was about during the much maligned period in time.Elliot Tiber (Demetri Martin) is a young Jewish guy trying to do the right thing and help his parents save the family motel business.  He moves back home, forgoes his dreams of heading to California, and ends up being the President of the local Chamber of Commerce.  Think of any small town in America with a couple thousand people and you get the idea of the farming community they called home.  His crazy mother is so out of control she has actually began charging extra for towels and clean sheets to the few guests that venture their way.The roles of Elliot's parents were played by Imelda Staunton and Henry Goodman and I have to say I am not sure there has ever been better performances on the screen than these two did in this movie.  They were phenomenal in their parts, making you both love and feel sorry for them as they rode through life pinching pennies, and fighting to keep the bank from foreclosing on everything they owned.  Having grown up in a small town of 1,600 people myself, I almost felt like I was back home while watching the perfectly adapted settings Ang Lee so magically brought to life.In an attempt to bring business to the local community Elliot happens across a newspaper where the headlines focused on a concert permit being pulled for an event called Woodstock in a neighboring town.  Elliot has personally headed a local musical production each year in his own back yard, already has his approved permit, and gets the idea of coordinating the events together.  He calls the Woodstock executives and within a few days everyone is in full gear putting pegs into holes to make the event happen.  All it took was a phone call, a local farmer getting his pockets greased, and a bunch of people with wads of cash ready to listen to some music.Elliot really does meander through most of the story which makes for a slow rhythmic flow that putters in the 45 mile per hour speed zone.  Don't expect any high paced action.  Once you connect with the pace of the film you can focus on the underlying tone which deals with the ""hippie"" generation and what people were attempting to discover.  Themselves.  Elliot doesn't know who he is or what he has the potential to become.  He finds himself trying marijuana, acid, experimenting with homosexuality and the free spirit of sex in general, not to mention some really awesome music.In the end ""Woodstock"" forever changed the way a nation would view ""hippies"" and as we saw within the movie it also drastically changed the way a family looked at itself.  Elliot was shot down the path of finding himself and in the process discovered secrets about his mother and family that rocked the foundation he thought his life was built upon.  The movie really does an excellent job at providing the backdrop of a serene hippie generation, comfortable walking around naked, doing drugs all while being polite to everyone around them.  Once you get past that the growth of Elliot surrounded by the insanity of his family adds for a very compelling story.Excellent movie, not perfect, but definitely worth viewing on a quiet evening if you have the need to relax and let things slow dow",4,"Sex, Drugs, Rock & Roll, thank you mam.",1279152000,"07 15, 2010",2010,3681,"['Taking', 'Woodstock', 'one', 'films', 'could', 'have', 'easily', 'missed', 'had', 'desire', 'see', 'was', 'only', 'chance', 'ended', 'up', 'catching', 'OnDemand', 'can', 'only', 'say', 'as', 'far', 'movies', 'go', 'am', 'very', 'pleased', 'happened', 'movie', 'was', 'fantastic', 'depiction', 'scenes', 'story', 'leading', 'up', 'monumental', 'event', 'become', 'infamous', 'might', 'be', 'only', 'concert', 'history', 'literally', 'own', 'specific', 'decade', 'what', 'life', 'was', 'much', 'maligned', 'period', 'time.Elliot', 'Tiber', 'Demetri', 'Martin', 'young', 'Jewish', 'guy', 'trying', 'do', 'right', 'thing', 'help', 'parents', 'save', 'family', 'motel', 'business', 'back', 'home', 'dreams', 'heading', 'California', 'up', 'being', 'President', 'local', 'Chamber', 'Commerce', 'Think', 'small', 'town', 'America', 'couple', 'thousand', 'people', 'get', 'idea', 'farming', 'community', 'called', 'home', 'crazy', 'mother', 'so', 'control', 'actually', 'began', 'charging', 'extra', 'towels', 'clean', 'sheets', 'few', 'guests', 'venture', 'way.The', 'roles', 'Elliot', 'parents', 'were', 'played', 'Imelda', 'Staunton', 'Henry', 'Goodman', 'have', 'say', 'am', 'not', 'sure', 'there', 'ever', 'been', 'better', 'performances', 'screen', 'two', 'did', 'movie', 'were', 'phenomenal', 'parts', 'making', 'love', 'feel', 'sorry', 'rode', 'life', 'pinching', 'pennies', 'fighting', 'keep', 'bank', 'foreclosing', 'everything', 'owned', 'Having', 'grown', 'up', 'small', 'town', '1,600', 'people', 'almost', 'felt', 'was', 'back', 'home', 'watching', 'perfectly', 'adapted', 'settings', 'Ang', 'Lee', 'so', 'magically', 'brought', 'life.In', 'attempt', 'bring', 'business', 'local', 'community', 'Elliot', 'newspaper', 'where', 'headlines', 'focused', 'concert', 'permit', 'being', 'pulled', 'event', 'called', 'Woodstock', 'neighboring', 'town', 'Elliot', 'personally', 'headed', 'local', 'musical', 'production', 'year', 'own', 'back', 'yard', 'already', 'approved', 'permit', 'idea', 'coordinating', 'events', 'together', 'Woodstock', 'executives', 'few', 'days', 'everyone', 'full', 'gear', 'putting', 'pegs', 'holes', 'make', 'event', 'happen', 'took', 'was', 'phone', 'call', 'local', 'farmer', 'getting', 'pockets', 'greased', 'bunch', 'people', 'wads', 'cash', 'ready', 'listen', 'music.Elliot', 'really', 'meander', 'most', 'story', 'slow', 'rhythmic', 'flow', 'putters', '45', 'mile', 'hour', 'speed', 'zone', 'Do', ""n't"", 'expect', 'high', 'paced', 'action', 'Once', 'connect', 'pace', 'film', 'can', 'focus', 'underlying', 'tone', 'hippie', 'generation', 'what', 'people', 'were', 'attempting', 'discover', 'Themselves', 'Elliot', ""n't"", 'know', 'who', 'what', 'potential', 'become', 'trying', 'marijuana', 'acid', 'experimenting', 'homosexuality', 'free', 'spirit', 'sex', 'general', 'not', 'mention', 'really', 'awesome', 'music.In', 'end', 'Woodstock', 'forever', 'changed', 'way', 'nation', 'would', 'view', 'hippies', 'saw', 'movie', 'also', 'drastically', 'changed', 'way', 'family', 'looked', 'Elliot', 'was', 'shot', 'down', 'path', 'finding', 'process', 'discovered', 'secrets', 'mother', 'family', 'rocked', 'foundation', 'thought', 'life', 'was', 'built', 'movie', 'really', 'excellent', 'job', 'providing', 'backdrop', 'serene', 'hippie', 'generation', 'comfortable', 'walking', 'around', 'naked', 'doing', 'drugs', 'being', 'polite', 'everyone', 'Once', 'get', 'growth', 'Elliot', 'surrounded', 'insanity', 'family', 'very', 'compelling', 'story.Excellent', 'movie', 'not', 'perfect', 'definitely', 'worth', 'viewing', 'quiet', 'evening', 'have', 'need', 'relax', 'let', 'things', 'slow', 'dow']",N/A

It was largely filmed right down the road from my house, and I even got to be an extra in it (although I'm not sure I ever actually appear in it anywhere).  An interesting experience.  More interesting, by far, than the movie has turned out to be once I finally saw it.  You'd think, with a movie that had that sort of personal connection, I wouldn't get drowsy in the first 15 minutes, but I did.  It just... dragged.  Forty minutes into it, the person who was watching the movie with me seemed bemused by its ""Woodstock"" title, and also expressed a feeling that it was somewhat aimless, adding that ""it seems almost like an amateur movie"".It's a tough movie to critique, I'm discovering.  It's hard to pick any one thing that you can hold up as particularly bad.  Maybe that's the whole point.  It doesn't feel like there's enough real substance or structure, or point, or anything to really grasp onto with Taking Woodstock.  In all the hours I sat around on ""the set"", waiting, watching and listening to what was going on, and observing Ang Lee directing, I remember thinking to myself that it didn't seem like he really knew what he wanted a lot of the time, that there was a certain vagueness to the vision.  Assistants often stepped in to try and clarify for people what was wanted, which came across (again, to me, at least) as contradictory and confusing.  And I guess that's how Taking Woodstock struck me: vague and unclear as to what it wanted to be.  It doesn't help matters that the movie can't even culminate in ending up at Woodstock itself - the actual event.  I understand the reason for that.  It's about one person who was pivotal in making the event happen, and the irony that he never manages to see the concert.  A window to the world of one insignificant individual....  Is that the point of this film?  Couldn't just about any of us be the subject of a movie then?  Well, I digress....On the upside, Liev Shreiber as Vilma was a definite high point.

Demetri Martin, who plays the lead character, has always made me laugh with his stand-up comedy and I was hoping for good things in his debut movie role.  I've also always been a big fan of Woodstock and the music and fashions of the 60s.  I've seen the original Woodstock movie (way back when, on VHS) and was expecting this to be a funny behind-the-scenes view of the events surrounding the main event.  However, this movie is not actually about Woodstock--certainly not to the degree that the trailers and posters suggest.  Taking Woodstock is about a young man coming out of the closet in the late 60s, who just happens to live near some kind of musical festival.  And you know what?  Leaving aside my disappointment that the concert pretty much doesn't feature in this movie at all, it's still not even a good story in itself.Firstly, the vibe is all wrong.  There is nothing of the feel of the 60s here at all.  Secondly, Demetri delivers his lines as though he is reading them.  Even in the rare times when he musters a convincing display of emotion he just doesn't have any screen presence.  Most of the other actors play simple stereotypes, overplaying their roles to the extent that they're almost a parody of their own characters.  Also, trotted out as though by checklist is the typical medley of 60s cliches, such as the inadvertent acid-trip.  And where the heck is the music?  For a movie supposedly based around one of the most musically-significant concerts in the history of modern music, there is almost nothing at all.  You get the closing two bars of someone pretending to be Simon and Garfunkle, plus some brief snatches of other songs here and there, but nothing that makes you think of the real Woodstock performances.  Somewhat ironically, the first piece of music in the movie that is readily-identifiable as being from this era is by The Doors, a band who were never invited to Woodstock.So, it's not about the music, it doesn't authentically convey the 60s vibe, the dialogue is trite, and the characters are mostly cardboard cutouts.  The props and settings are pretty convincing, though.  Oh, and the poster looks cool.

I tire of fast paced films that are like the empty calories you get from another over-sweet but useless soda drink.There's clearly a lot more to this story than is presented but despite that I love the peaceful chaos leading to the event and the growth of the poor nebbish who triggered this social landslide. It was part protest of the war, a gathering of like-minded but diverse people and a musical event that changed music entertainment forever.What really struck me was how even the smallest part played gave the sense that even this person, in this pivotal event, has an experience that could be successfully explored. Some complaints about wooden acting eludes me. The acting is sometimes stilted, stressed, but that's a wonderful reflection of how out of control this music fest became. After all, how would any small town and its residents react to half a million people showing up with only a week or so notice?Demetri Martin was surprisingly well cast for this role. This poor guy has no idea what he's done and struggles appropriately with the newfound dissent of a lot of the townsfolk who hate what he's caused. His character Jacob also has to deal with the added stress the influx of thousands of happy freaks and music fans have on his town, his parents' business and the fallout triggered by the concert.I particularly enjoyed the fact that being right there where it was all happening our hapless Jacob never manages to get close enough to see the actual concert. Like most of those in attendance all he can do is look into the distance at the pretty stage lights and listen to the music as it inundates like a wavering sea of sound (a great scene enhanced by way of some potent chemicals).This is a brave film commemorating an incredible moment in American history and how one person brought it about as well as how it changed him. There's no deep meaning, not major issues resolved. There's change and there's acceptance, two fundamental aspects of personal revelation.The cast was so well immersed in the period that while they all stand out, they are also contributing to the whole. Liev Schreiber as the cross dressing ""Velma"", Vilma (?) hotel security for Jacob and his parents is a treat.

1287355,A3AVJCB1ZD6ZY5,B002SQ364Q,R. Kyle,"[1, 3]","""Taking Woodstock"" is based on the book by the same name which is the true account of Elliott Tiber, one of the people who saved the Woodstock festival.  The film is produced by Ang Lee, of ""Crouching Tiger"" fame.Forty years ago, in White Lake, a small New York town in the Catskills, Jake and Sonia Teichberg (Henry Goodman and Imelda Staunton) were struggling to keep their hotel running. Their son, Elliott  (Demetri Martin) was donating his time and income to the effort. Elliott, who volunteered to be president of the town's chamber of commerce, convinced the bank to give them just a few more months to make the payment. He's going to have the music festival for the second year and this time it's going to be bigger and better....Little did they know...When Elliott discovers a nearby town turned down the Woodstock festival, he contacts the producers and discovers that Michael (Jonathan Groff) is a friend of his from the old neighborhood. Using the permit Elliott's gotten for his own festival, they decide to put Woodstock on in their town instead. In just a few weeks, they have signed up local farmer Max Yasgar (Eugene Levy) to host the festival on his farm and a whole host of characters show up to help.  An odd cast of characters from the town Vietnam vet, Billy (Emile Hirsch) to a cross-dressing retired Marine Vilma (Liev Schreiber) show up to help in their own ways.Key to the drama, though, is the relationship between Elliott and his aged parents.  He's given everything to the business in the hopes of maintaining them and their esteem while he's not told them about his own lifestyle. Elliott's coming-of-age is very much in parallel to that of the growth of the Woodstock festival and subsequent free lifestyle.Note:  this is a film about sex, drugs, and rock and roll. Not so much the rock and roll element, but you will see drug use and naked bodies. I'd recommend this film to the young at heart, but not the very young for that one reason.My only complaint was that we only really heard snippets of the music as a backdrop to the story. For me, Woodstock was as much about the music as the characters. Still a very good film, though.Rebecca Kyle, August 2009",4,How Woodstock came to be,1251504000,"08 29, 2009",2009,2189,"['Taking', 'Woodstock', 'based', 'book', 'same', 'name', 'true', 'account', 'Elliott', 'Tiber', 'one', 'people', 'who', 'saved', 'Woodstock', 'festival', 'film', 'produced', 'Ang', 'Lee', 'Crouching', 'Tiger', 'fame.Forty', 'years', 'ago', 'White', 'Lake', 'small', 'New', 'York', 'town', 'Catskills', 'Jake', 'Sonia', 'Teichberg', 'Henry', 'Goodman', 'Imelda', 'Staunton', 'were', 'struggling', 'keep', 'hotel', 'running', 'son', 'Elliott', 'Demetri', 'Martin', 'was', 'donating', 'time', 'income', 'effort', 'Elliott', 'who', 'volunteered', 'be', 'president', 'town', 'chamber', 'commerce', 'convinced', 'bank', 'give', 'just', 'few', 'more', 'months', 'make', 'payment', 'going', 'have', 'music', 'festival', 'second', 'year', 'time', 'going', 'be', 'bigger', 'better', '.Little', 'did', 'know', 'When', 'Elliott', 'nearby', 'town', 'turned', 'down', 'Woodstock', 'festival', 'producers', 'discovers', 'Michael', 'Jonathan', 'Groff', 'friend', 'old', 'neighborhood', 'Using', 'permit', 'Elliott', 'gotten', 'own', 'festival', 'decide', 'put', 'Woodstock', 'town', 'instead', 'just', 'few', 'weeks', 'have', 'signed', 'up', 'local', 'farmer', 'Max', 'Yasgar', 'Eugene', 'Levy', 'host', 'festival', 'farm', 'whole', 'host', 'characters', 'show', 'up', 'help', 'odd', 'cast', 'characters', 'town', 'Vietnam', 'vet', 'Billy', 'Emile', 'Hirsch', 'cross-dressing', 'retired', 'Marine', 'Vilma', 'Liev', 'Schreiber', 'show', 'up', 'help', 'own', 'ways.Key', 'drama', 'relationship', 'Elliott', 'aged', 'parents', 'given', 'everything', 'business', 'hopes', 'maintaining', 'esteem', 'not', 'told', 'own', 'lifestyle', 'Elliott', 'coming-of-age', 'very', 'much', 'parallel', 'growth', 'Woodstock', 'festival', 'subsequent', 'free', 'lifestyle.Note', 'film', 'sex', 'drugs', 'rock', 'roll', 'Not', 'so', 'much', 'rock', 'roll', 'element', 'will', 'see', 'drug', 'use', 'naked', 'bodies', ""'d"", 'recommend', 'film', 'young', 'heart', 'not', 'very', 'young', 'one', 'reason.My', 'only', 'complaint', 'was', 'only', 'really', 'heard', 'snippets', 'music', 'backdrop', 'story', 'Woodstock', 'was', 'as', 'much', 'music', 'characters', 'Still', 'very', 'good', 'film', 'though.Rebecca', 'Kyle', 'August', '2009']",N/A
1287356,A2R1HAXRNU0QX7,B002SQ364Q,RMurray847,"[3, 5]","There are a few scenes in TAKING WOODSTOCK that are marvels of logistics.  Director Ang Lee is a master craftsperson, and he manages to make this relatively humble film cross the line from seeming to be an ambitious ""indie"" right into the realm of mainstream, studio funded territory.The film tells the story of Woodstock from the point of view of Elliot Teichberg, a young man who was simply trying to breathe new life into his parents' VERY rundown hotel in the Catskills.  When the event becomes considerably bigger than he ever anticipated, Elliot is swept up in the chaos.  And in the midway point of the film, when Woodstock is underway (but before it has become a mud bog), Elliot hops on the motorcycle of a state trooper and is driven the several miles from his hotel to the farm where the concert is taking place.  The road is clogged with hippies by the many thousands.  Some are just sitting on the side of the road, apparently resigned to getting no further, but at peace with just hanging out.  Others are optimistic about making it.  Still more have set up little roadside stands, where they sell watermelon, or corn or whatever.  We see young families.  We see a surging but peaceful mass of humanity.  The scene is staged to almost feel like one long take, and it is quite impressive.  Technically, it is a logistical marvel.  It's also a quiet but powerful scene.  There is a crush of people, yet no one is upset.  No yelling.  No incessant honking of horns.  The road to Woodstock takes on an almost church-like quality...it feels like these people are on a pilgrimage.  These five minutes or so are among the best moments of pure film craftsmanship of the year.Unfortunately, TAKING WOODSTOCK gets a lot of things wrong too.  Most crucially, it's all pilgrimage with no payoff.  Elliot (who is a renamed real-life character) never gets close to the concert...he only sees it a couple of times from a GREAT distance.  We see how peacefully eager everyone is to get there.  We feel the vibe of ""hey man, it's cool.""  We see this mass of hippies in only a good and noble light.  Yet the film never comes close to helping us understand how Woodstock became a defining moment for a generation.  A touchstone.  A cultural happening that was greater than the sum of its parts.  I may KNOW these things because I read them in the past...but the film doesn't really even seem to try.  Lee is more interested in the far more personal (and frankly, somewhat mundane) journey of Elliot himself.Elliot (played a bit too woodenly by Demetri Martin) is an aspiring businessman.  In his mid-20s...he wears suits or conservative clothing.  He does not resemble in any way the hippie culture.  He's respected by the older folks in his little town, where he is president of the tiny Chamber of Commerce.  He is clearly under the thumb of his parents...especially his domineering and manipulative mother (played in a broad, stereotypical manner by Imelda Staunton).  He is also, we discover, gay.  And while that fact is clearly important to Elliot (as is keeping it secret)...it is not very important to us.  During the chaos leading up to Woodstock, Elliot meets a handsome roadie with whom he has a bit of a fling.  It's handled as though it's a trivial event...yet we know it's probably a fairly earthshaking moment for the reserved Elliot.  Yet Lee doesn't make it moving for us...just a few throwaway laughs.Far more successful is the growing relationship between Elliot and his father (Henry Goodman, who also overacts a little...but has a great face and a great deal of warmth).  The two had very little to say to each other as the movie begins.  In fact, dad has little to say to anyone...he's so beaten down by his unsuccessful life.  Yet as these hippies invade his town and his hotel...he finds himself enlivened.  Not only is his business booming, but he thrives in the very open, honest, trusting way he's simply accepted into the nomadic community.  And as his heart opens to these people, it opens towards Elliot as well, and the two come to some nice, comfortable understandings together.  These moments were the only truly, genuinely emotionally affecting points of the film.Many things happen in the film, and the period details are great.  It IS an interesting story...seeing the farmer Yasgur (a dandy Eugene Levy) negotiate the rent of his land to the promoters.  Seeing Woodstock brainchild Michael Lang (a wonderful Jonathan Groff) ride around on a horse, with an open vest barely covering his bare chest, like Jesus from GODSPELL.  But other moments fall flat.  Emile Hirsch gives a clich&eacute;d performance as a cardboard ""Vietnam vet"" who has ""seen terrible things, man.""  An extended LSD scene with Martin, Paul Dano & Kelli Garner is flat out boring (when was someone else's drug trip ever really interesting to see on film?).I had a pleasant time at the film.  The good just outweighs the bad...so I would give the film 3.5 stars.  If I had to put my finger on why the film didn't quite work...I would say it is the script.  I don't know anything personal about James Schamus (who did GREAT work for films such as THE ICE STORM, BROKEBACK MOUNTAIN & AUTO FOCUS)...but it feels as though he never really made an emotional connection to the events he was trying to depict.  He crammed in a lot of STUFF...but didn't order it in such a way as to give it meaning.  And Lee, perhaps understanding that the script lacked emotional heft, allows many of his actors to get away with overacting and unspecific characterizations.  It's unlikely you'd regret spending a couple of hours TAKING WOODSTOCK...but it's liable to leave you still waiting for that definitive film on this landmark event.",3,A pleasant film that could have

Those were really groovey times and it will never happen again.

That's true.And since I saw the movie nearly 40 years ago, it's been kind of a fantasy. You know, some like ""The Wizard of Oz,"" say, but the Woodstock movie--and concept--soothed me. It really shouldn't have worked!Then, two weeks before the 40th anniversary of the event, my wife and I visited the museum at the site. Incredible. It was a tiny town in 1969 inundated with a half a million people, and it's STILL a tiny town. Literally the night we returned from the site, I saw an ad for the film. So we went to see it.It's allegedly inspired by real events. Others have described the plot: Elliot Tiber, a young guy who'd just left the big apple to return to his parents tiny motel in the Catskills is the president of the local Chamber of Commerce. He and the Chamber issue a cheap license to a tiny show he plans to put on.The story was fun, it was cute. The acting was quite good. What wore me out, frankly, was repitition of more 60s cliches than I've heard since--the 60s! Yeah, yeah, I guess that was the point, but it was overdone. Even the experience Elliot had while tripping, it seemed like a scene from a bad, old Peter Fonda flick.The characters too were stereotypes. Elloit is the young Jewish guy struggling with his sexuality. His mother was the consummate tight wad. There was a funny element to that, I guess, but it got old pretty quickly. Then there was the Vietnam vet, played by Emile Hirsch. His acting was good, as expected, but the character was more of a stereotype than anything I could believe in.To director Ang Lee's credit, he really did cast someone, Jonathan Groff, who really does look remarkably like Micheal Langy. And Eugene Levy looks so much like Max Yasgur, you're swear you're lookin' at the original!Over all, it's enjoyable.

Based on the book by Elliot Tiber and Tom Monte, and adapted by James Schamus (""Brokeback Mountain""), ""Taking Woodstock"" is a comedy drama about a young man who wound up bringing Woodstock to the quiet town of Bethel, New York.The film, set in the summer of 1969, centers on 34-year-old Elliot Tiber (Demetri Martin), an interior designer whose parents Jake (Henry Goodman) and Sonia (Imelda Staunton) run El Monaco Motel. The small motel, of which service and quality is not the best in town, is facing foreclosure.Elliot manages to persuade the bank manager to wait for a while. Then he hears that the town of Wallkill pulled the permit for the upcoming Woodstock festival. Elliot, who happens to have a permit for a small local music festival, makes an offer to the concert's organizers. As it turned out, the music festival ends up attracting about 500,000 people to the town.I am not interested in the factual accuracy of ""Taking Woodstock."" I know this is not a documentary (and there is already one, simply amazing ""Woodstock""). The film beautifully captures the confusion (and near chaos) caused by the influx of attendees for the three-day concert. Ang Lee's comedy drama is full of fashion details and eccentric characters, mostly likable, but suffers from its underwritten drama about the protagonist and his family, and one-note performance from the lead. Where is Jake Gyllenhaal when we need him?I enjoyed ""Taking Woodstock"" for its atmosphere of the late 60s America, and nice turns from supporting players (some of which sometimes border on caricature, though).

1287366,A18GP1PWVTKXQQ,B002SQ364Q,Turfseer,"[2, 3]","*** This review may contain spoilers ***Up to a point, 'Taking Woodstock' really isn't such a bad film and I wonder what the reasons were for those people who positively hated it. There seem to be a group who were offended that Ang Lee didn't show any scenes of the actual concert or tried to recreate it by having actors playing some of the famous performers like Hendrix or Janis Joplin, singing their songs up on the stage. But what would have been the point of showing any of the actual concert scenes? If you're dying for some nostalgia, then you can buy the DVD of the original concert itself.There's also the bigger issue of the source material itself--Elliot Tiber's memoir, 'Taking Woodstock: A True Story of a Riot, a Concert, and a Life.' Tiber's claim that he introduced Michael Lang, one of the principal Woodstock Festival promoters, to Max Yasgur (who owned the farm where the festival was held), appears to be completely false. In addition, the concert promoters did not appear to use the family motel as a sort of headquarters for their operations. Even if that didn't happen, it's not at all implausible that it COULD have happened, so I think it's fine that a little suspension of disbelief here does not damage the overall impact of the film.'Taking Woodstock' really isn't about Woodstock at all. It's a coming of age story where the music festival acts as both a backdrop and catalyst, driving the principal characters forward in their emotional journey. The protagonist, Elliot Tiber (named Teichberg in the film), is in his mid-30s and remains with his parents, pouring his own money into a run-down family-owned motel in upstate New York. They have until the end of the summer to pay off the mortgage or the bank will foreclose on the property.Elliot's problem is his obnoxious, overbearing Jewish mother, Sonia (well played by the classically trained British actor, Imelda Staunton). She portrays herself as a perennial victim of anti-Semitism and pushes her passive, goodhearted husband, Jake, around at every turn. One thing she is right about: the pretentious theater group that inhabits the barn on their property, is a constant thorn in their side as they're unable to pay any rent.The best part of 'Taking Woodstock' is the arrival of Michael Lang and his entourage of businessmen who intend to make Woodstock a reality. Jonathan Groff is perfectly cast as promoter Lang, the hippie-businessman, who maintains a constant beatific grin on his face while doling out gobs of cash. It's Elliot, in his position as the head of the local Chamber of Commerce, who informs Lang that he can give the promoters a permit to hold a music festival; the problem is that his own land is found to be a useless swamp. Elliot then introduces Lang to Max Yasgur, (with Eugene Levy also perfectly cast as the tough but liberal farmer) who has the perfect spread for the music festival.The first hour of the film proceeds seamlessly with additional twists and turns: Elliot tries to help Billy, a local Vietnam Vet who suffers from post traumatic stress disorder; Elliot's mother drops her objections to the Festival organizers staying at the motel when Elliot drops a bag of cash in front of her, given to him by the promoters; Lev Schreiber plays Vilma, a trans-gender Korean War Veteran, who's hired as a security guard, eventually warding off hostile locals as the hippies invade the local area; despite the local opposition, business people in the area (along with Elliot's parents) see huge profits from the influx of all the young people and Elliot ends up kissing a gay construction worker at a wild party, foreshadowing his decision to come out of the closet.At the behest of his father, Elliot decides to go see the festival himself and encounters a State Trooper who confesses that he was planning to come to the festival to ""bust some hippies' heads"" but ""guesses"" he's been sidetracked by ""all the fumes"". The trooper amiably offers Elliot a ride on his motorcycle through the backed up traffic, near where the concert is going on. Ang Lee wisely never has Elliot arrive at the stage area which was probably the experience of thousands who never actually got to see the event close up.Ang Lee interestingly doesn't sugarcoat the festival's appearance, as the weather conditions end up turning it into a virtual mud fest. At the same time, Lee views Woodstock as having had a positive effect on most of its participants. Elliot in particular, has a transformational experience, inside a VW bus with a hippie couple after taking a few hits of LSD. When he returns to the motel, Elliot realizes that his mother hasn't changed at all after he discovers that she's been hoarding money for years and could have paid off the mortgage long before he began helping his parents. On the bright side, Elliot's father feels he's found a second youth as a result of Woodstock and father and son find they're able to bond at film's end.It's clear that the second half of 'Taking Woodstock' isn't as good as the first. A big problem is that Elliot's internal conflict is not clear until the film's end where he recognizes that he's gay and must leave upstate New York and find a new life. The denouement might have been more effective if the second half of the film wasn't so slow moving. Particularly problematic are all those 'split-scene' scenes as well as the amount of time it takes for Elliot to wander off from his 'nest' at the motel, sojourn into the 'wilderness' (a psychedelic journey) and return to his cocoon, which is no longer the same.'Taking Woodstock' is by no means a great movie; but wisely the tangential coming of age story works much better than an unfocused tribute to anonymous festival participants.",3,Tangential coming of age story works better than narrative about direct Woodstock participants,1318723200,"10 16, 2011",2011,5733,"['***', 'review',
