This DVD comes up constantly when you look up the excellent films The Odessa File, Marathon Man, and Three Days of the Condor, as well as the decent Holcroft Covenant and Boys from Brazil so, being a sucker for 70's films of this sort I gave this a shot, already knowing full well that Stephen Collins isn't exactly brimming with charisma (see Start Trek TMP) but hoping that the source material would make up for it. Well the adaptation, the lackluster direction, dreadful pacing as well as cardboard performances by all involved make this a terrible disapointment.

Mainly about a guy that sleeps around with all the women he can find.  He's like a male prostitute but without the money.  You hear that he sleeps with a married woman.  Rather disgusting to see a producer/writer that would allow that in a film with his name on it; disgraceful for my money.  In all, the movie seems like one that the producer didn't put a lot of time and thoughtfulness in to.

1070745,A16IM9MYTHCKYQ,B000PFUAPK,Penumbra,"[49, 51]","""The Rhinemann Exchange"" was the first adaptation of a Robert Ludlum book to film.  It was also one of the first TV miniseries, and the cast is a Who's Who of 70's television stardom.David Spaulding (Stephen Collins) had a very cosmopolitan upbringing thanks to his father, a world famous concert pianist. He has lived in cities around the world, is fluent in several languages, and has an engineering degree.  All of this makes him a desirable recruit for US Army Intelligence in the early days of World War II.After proving himself during an assignment in Spain, David Spaulding is hand picked as the only suitable candidate for a below the radar operation code named Tortuga.The Germans are desperate for industrial diamonds for their V2 rocket, and the Americans are equally desperate to get a better gyroscope for their bombers.  A rogue exchange is brokered, and scheduled to take place in the neutral city of Buenos Aires, Argentina.  A mission so controversial that his superiors won't even entrust Spaulding with the true nature of the exchange for fear he would refuse the assignment.In Buenos Aires it seems everyone knows more about Spaulding's msision than he does.  He finds himself targeted by the Americans, Germans, and even Haganah as he struggles to learn the truth and complete his task.The DVD is divided into three chapters corresponding with the original three night airing of the miniseries in 1977.  From the DVD package, this is full frame 1:33:1; approximately 4 hours and 8 minutes; Dolby Mono 2.0 English soundtrack, and English SDH subtitles.  There are no bonus or special features.Recommended.",5,A thrilling rogue operation,1191283200,"10 2, 2007",2007,1625,"['Rhinemann', 'Exchange', 'was', 'first', 'adaptation', 'Robert', 'Ludlum', 'book', 'film', 'was', 'also', 'one', 'first', 'TV', 'miniseries', 'cast', 'Who', 'Who', '70', 'television', 'stardom.David', 'Spaulding', 'Stephen', 'Collins', 'had', 'very', 'cosmopolitan', 'upbringing', 'thanks', 'father', 'world', 'famous', 'concert', 'pianist', 'lived', 'cities', 'world', 'fluent', 'several', 'languages', 'engineering', 'degree', 'desirable', 'recruit', 'US', 'Army', 'Intelligence', 'early', 'days', 'World', 'War', 'II.After', 'proving', 'assignment', 'Spain', 'David', 'Spaulding', 'hand', 'picked', 'only', 'suitable', 'candidate', 'radar', 'operation', 'code', 'named', 'Tortuga.The', 'Germans', 'are', 'desperate', 'industrial', 'diamonds', 'V2', 'rocket', 'Americans', 'are', 'equally', 'desperate', 'get', 'better', 'gyroscope', 'bombers', 'A', 'rogue', 'exchange', 'brokered', 'scheduled', 'take', 'place', 'neutral', 'city', 'Buenos', 'Aires', 'Argentina', 'mission', 'so', 'controversial', 'superiors', 'wo', ""n't"", 'even', 'entrust', 'Spaulding', 'true', 'nature', 'exchange', 'fear', 'would', 'refuse', 'assignment.In', 'Buenos', 'everyone', 'more', 'Spaulding', 'msision', 'targeted', 'Americans', 'Germans', 'even', 'Haganah', 'learn', 'truth', 'complete', 'task.The', 'DVD', 'divided', 'three', 'chapters', 'corresponding', 'original', 'three', 'night', 'airing', 'miniseries', '1977', 'DVD', 'package', 'full', 'frame', '1:33:1', 'approximately', '4', 'hours', '8', 'minutes', 'Dolby', 'Mono', '2.0', 'English', 'soundtrack', 'English', 'SDH', 'subtitles', 'are', 'bonus', 'special', 'features.Recommended']",The Rhinemann Exchange
