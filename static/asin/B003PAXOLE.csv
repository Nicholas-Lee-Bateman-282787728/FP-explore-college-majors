Sean Bean always delivers..and in this one it's twice as nice.  Sean Bean plays a set of brothers (possibly twins but one looks shorter and skinnier than the other.) One of whom has been recently incarcerated after a 'job' that took in over five hundred thousand dollars.  The incarcerated one calls his brother, also Sean Bean to find retrieve, and split the money with him.  The money was thrown out of the window during a police chase and the only thing they know is that it hit a white station wagon with wood panel siding.The writing in this movie is not the most original, but Sean Bean, Chris Hemsworth, and Victoria Proefeta turn in excellent performances that draw you into the sometimes unbelievable situation and give you free reign to suspend your disbelief.  Cash at it's core is a story of personal morals, survival, and humanity that is wrapped in the vestiges of luck violence and fear.  I enjoyed every single frame, line, scene, what have you of this little sleeper indie and if there is ever a sequel, which the way it ends suggests there may be I will be the first one to buy it.

1356648,ABLBRUT8DALNN,B003PAXOLE,Todd Smith,"[0, 0]","Some of the blandest of stories can be made into gems by the performance of one man. The story in Ca$h is by no means original, but the addition of an outstanding bad guy, with his own original way of doing things, makes the film worth seeing. Sean Phelan (Chris &#34;Thor&#34; Hemsworth) is down on his luck and about to have his house taken by the bank, when an amazing thing happens. While driving on the highway, he sees a high speed chase in progress. The robbers, not wanting to be caught with the evidence, throw their loot off the overpass and right onto Phelan's car. The Phelan's think that God has smiled on them and they start making plans for life in the fast lane, when their luck turns again. Thanks to their greed, the robber (Sean Bean) is able to track them down and shows up at the Phelan's door, demanding his money back. LOTR's Sean Bean stars as the bad guy and he really has turned into one of the best criminal actors you could get. He's this big scary guy, with such a calm demeanor, willing to tell you everything that's on his mind. Bean takes the Phelan's through a wild week, trying to get back his money in a variety of ways, that I think will really surprise you. One of Bean's strength as an actor turns out to be a weakness to his character in this film. As I said, he has a way of always telling you what's on his mind, and in this film it's all about the cash. That being said, Bean keeps trying to figure out the amount of money left to be repaid and it gets pretty annoying. Also of note, while this was a pretty entertaining film, it is also about 40 minutes too long. Admittedly, the story is a bit thin, so the writers try to expand the story as much as they can. While it's terrific at first, by the end, the film is seriously lagging, and it takes a lot away from an otherwise terrific film. Ca$h doesn't offer many surprises, but the cast is terrific and it most defiantly has it's moments. It's the perfect film to use if you're looking to kill some time without having to think too much about it.",4,The Ultimate Movie Review! - (...) - @tss5078,1397952000,"04 20, 2014",2014,2041,"['blandest', 'stories', 'can', 'be', 'made', 'gems', 'performance', 'one', 'man', 'story', 'Ca', 'h', 'means', 'original', 'addition', 'outstanding', 'bad', 'guy', 'own', 'original', 'way', 'doing', 'things', 'film', 'seeing', 'Sean', 'Phelan', 'Chris', '34', 'Thor', '34', 'Hemsworth', 'down', 'luck', 'have', 'house', 'taken', 'bank', 'when', 'amazing', 'thing', 'happens', 'driving', 'highway', 'high', 'speed', 'chase', 'progress', 'robbers', 'not', 'wanting', 'be', 'caught', 'evidence', 'throw', 'loot', 'overpass', 'right', 'onto', 'Phelan', 'car', 'Phelan', 'think', 'God', 'smiled', 'start', 'making', 'plans', 'life', 'fast', 'lane', 'when', 'luck', 'again', 'Thanks', 'greed', 'robber', 'Sean', 'Bean', 'able', 'track', 'down', 'up', 'Phelan', 'door', 'demanding', 'money', 'back', 'LOTR', 'Sean', 'Bean', 'stars', 'bad', 'guy', 'really', 'turned', 'one', 'best', 'criminal', 'actors', 'could', 'get', 'big', 'scary', 'guy', 'calm', 'demeanor', 'willing', 'tell', 'everything', 'mind', 'Bean', 'Phelan', 'wild', 'week', 'trying', 'get', 'back', 'money', 'variety', 'ways', 'think', 'will', 'really', 'surprise', 'One', 'Bean', 'strength', 'actor', 'out', 'be', 'weakness', 'character', 'film', 'said', 'way', 'always', 'telling', 'what', 'mind', 'film', 'cash', 'being', 'said', 'Bean', 'trying', 'figure', 'out', 'amount', 'money', 'left', 'be', 'repaid', 'pretty', 'annoying', 'Also', 'note', 'was', 'pretty', 'entertaining', 'film', 'also', 'about', '40', 'minutes', 'too', 'long', 'Admittedly', 'story', 'bit', 'thin', 'writers', 'try', 'expand', 'story', 'as', 'much', 'can', 'terrific', 'first', 'end', 'film', 'seriously', 'lagging', 'lot', 'away', 'otherwise', 'terrific', 'film', 'Ca', 'h', ""n't"", 'offer', 'many', 'surprises', 'cast', 'terrific', 'most', 'defiantly', 'moments', 'perfect', 'film', 'use', ""'re"", 'looking', 'kill', 'time', 'having', 'think', 'too', 'much']",N/A

Chris Hemsworth (Thor) plays Sam, an ordinary guy who has a suitcase full of cash fall on his car.  After Sam and his wife Leslie (Victoria Profeta) play off some debts, and go on a spending spree, they are visited by Pyke Kubic (Sean Bean,Goldeneye), the brother of the man who originally stole the money.Kubic recovers the readily available cash, but refuses to write off any losses, and demands that the couple settle the debt to the penny.  Moving into their home, the insistent Kubic takes over Sam and Leslie's lives.  Even after selling their new SUV, and taking a loan on their home, the couple is still short, so Kubic forces them to become criminals.Even with the oddball turn down a criminal path, Ca$h is fairly well written, and with a mostly low key tone, sticks pretty close to reality.  Profeta and Hemsworth do a good job as the beleaguered couple, but it's Sean Bean who keeps the fires stoked, as his character's persistent focus on numbers, and increasingly over the top behavior, keeps you interested in what happens next.
