790619,A31T9I6KLDTYZC,B00011V8BS,Dr Lawrence Hauser,"[8, 8]","Evenhand tells the story of a newly joined partnership of two patrol car police officers in the rural (fictional) town of San Lovelis, Texas. One of the officers, Ted Morning, is a long-standing, hard core member of the force. He is paired up with a transfer, Bob Francis, who makes it a point to mention straight away that he is not a rookie, just a new addition to the San Lovelis staff. But as we get to know this duo as they go about their daily routine of dealing with domestic violence, car wrecks, armed robbery, and drug violations, it quickly becomes clear that next to Officer Morning Bob Francis seems the less experienced if for no other reason than he possesses a conscience. Although Morning's effectiveness as a cop is portrayed by director Joseph Pierson as an epiphenomenon of his 'primitive' relation to the citizens on his beat, it is the internal struggle Francis faces as he responsibly attempts to discharge his obligation as a police officer while contending with the moral conflicts inherent to wielding authority through force that sustains the narrative tension of this engrossing film. The relationship between the two men (played to perfection by actors Bill Sage and Bill Dawes) is also explored in depth, with particular emphasis on the way in which opposing personalities equilibrate as a function of time. This aspect of the film was handled by Pierson with exceptional care, precision and skill. The impact, in fact, is almost documentarian in its capacity to represent realistically the way in which conflict between people inevitably transforms each participant; subtly at first, then increasingly dramatically as the individuals involved interact within the singular emotional field produced by virtue of their entirely unique confrontation. Evenhand is a splendid example of psychological drama enacted on a small scale. Its perspicacious lens on human dilemma and strife will, however, stay with a viewer longer, and more tenaciously, than its scale gives reason to expect. My compliments to Sundance Channel for making this thought-provoking, lovingly crafted film available to cable television viewers.",5,Police Work As Seen From The Inside Out,1070755200,"12 7, 2003",2003,2142,"['Evenhand', 'story', 'newly', 'joined', 'partnership', 'two', 'patrol', 'car', 'police', 'officers', 'rural', 'fictional', 'town', 'San', 'Lovelis', 'Texas', 'One', 'officers', 'Ted', 'Morning', 'long-standing', 'hard', 'core', 'member', 'force', 'paired', 'up', 'transfer', 'Bob', 'Francis', 'who', 'point', 'mention', 'straight', 'away', 'not', 'rookie', 'just', 'new', 'addition', 'San', 'Lovelis', 'staff', 'get', 'know', 'duo', 'go', 'daily', 'routine', 'dealing', 'domestic', 'violence', 'car', 'wrecks', 'armed', 'robbery', 'drug', 'violations', 'quickly', 'clear', 'next', 'Officer', 'Morning', 'Bob', 'Francis', 'less', 'experienced', 'other', 'reason', 'conscience', 'Morning', 'effectiveness', 'cop', 'portrayed', 'director', 'Joseph', 'Pierson', 'epiphenomenon', ""'primitive"", 'relation', 'citizens', 'beat', 'internal', 'struggle', 'Francis', 'responsibly', 'discharge', 'obligation', 'police', 'officer', 'contending', 'moral', 'conflicts', 'inherent', 'wielding', 'authority', 'force', 'narrative', 'tension', 'engrossing', 'film', 'relationship', 'two', 'men', 'played', 'perfection', 'actors', 'Bill', 'Sage', 'Bill', 'Dawes', 'also', 'explored', 'depth', 'particular', 'emphasis', 'way', 'opposing', 'personalities', 'equilibrate', 'function', 'time', 'aspect', 'film', 'was', 'handled', 'Pierson', 'exceptional', 'care', 'precision', 'skill', 'impact', 'fact', 'almost', 'documentarian', 'capacity', 'represent', 'realistically', 'way', 'conflict', 'people', 'inevitably', 'participant', 'subtly', 'first', 'then', 'increasingly', 'dramatically', 'individuals', 'involved', 'interact', 'singular', 'emotional', 'field', 'produced', 'virtue', 'entirely', 'unique', 'confrontation', 'Evenhand', 'splendid', 'example', 'psychological', 'drama', 'enacted', 'small', 'scale', 'perspicacious', 'lens', 'human', 'dilemma', 'strife', 'will', 'however', 'stay', 'viewer', 'longer', 'more', 'tenaciously', 'scale', 'reason', 'expect', 'compliments', 'Sundance', 'Channel', 'making', 'thought-provoking', 'lovingly', 'crafted', 'film', 'available', 'cable', 'television', 'viewers']",Evenhand
790620,AVYPOYFT320BU,B00011V8BS,E. A Hill,"[4, 4]","I happened to stumble upon this movie on the Sundance Channel one evening.  It immediately made its way onto my list of favorite movies of all time.  What is most surprising is the reason behind why it is so superb.  Unlike many movies today, there are no special effects and few action scenes to speak of.  The weight of the movie's plot is carried solely on the shoulders of the two lead actors, Bill Sage and Bill Dawes.  Bill Sage turns in an over-the-top performance as Officer Morning...a wild cowboy/take-no-prisoners-type of cop.  He arrests people first and asks questions later.  In fact, I suspect Mr. Sage had a lot of fun playing this role.  However Bill Dawes, who portrays Officer Francis, has the more challenging job of keeping pace with Bill Sage's performance without becoming overshadowed or upstaged by it.  Mr. Dawes keeps pace beautifully and both actors play off each other to perfection.  I really would have believed that they were true cops. Bill Dawes is absolutely phenomenal in his understated role as Officer Francis.....a sensitive, recently transferred cop struggling to find his way and adjust to the wild ways of his newly assigned partner.Bill Dawes brings a certain vulnerability to a character unlike any contemporary actor I can think of.  He has a special knack for being able to portray a wide range of emotions, but is particularly talented in expressing pensive, melancholy, and fear.  This is especially evident in the second half of Chapter 12 (A Close Encounter) when Officer Francis comes face to face with a boy in a laundry room who has a gun pointed directly at him, immediately followed by a scene later that evening when Francis is seen alone in his apartment reflecting on his earlier near-death experience. There is very little dialogue in these two scenes, yet I was able to feel Officer Francis' fear/sadness/frustration/loneliness/pain/shortcomings etc.  Most importantly, Mr. Dawes is able to convey these emotions through his expressions and body language in less than 2 minutes and without ever saying a word.  Being able to do this is acting.  Being able to do it as well as he does is TALENT.  He also possesses a one-of-kind vulnerable pout that will make any lady's heart just melt.  In the first half of Chapter 9 (Take These Cuffs Off) Officer Morning asks Francis if ""his ex-wife just stopped speaking to him one day"".  With a sudden downward glance, and heartbreaking subtle frown/pout, he responds that ""it's a little more complicated than that.""  One of the biggest mysteries of modern times is how Mr. Dawes has not had more success as a dramatic actor.  I have a feeling we are going to be seeing a lot more of this highly talented actor in years to come.....",5,"Highly, Highly Recommend this Surprise Gem!!!",1115769600,"05 11, 2005",2005,2731,"['happened', 'stumble', 'movie', 'Sundance', 'Channel', 'one', 'evening', 'immediately', 'made', 'way', 'list', 'favorite', 'movies', 'time', 'What', 'most', 'surprising', 'reason', 'why', 'so', 'superb', 'many', 'movies', 'today', 'are', 'special', 'effects', 'few', 'action', 'scenes', 'speak', 'weight', 'movie', 'plot', 'carried', 'solely', 'shoulders', 'two', 'lead', 'actors', 'Bill', 'Sage', 'Bill', 'Dawes', 'Bill', 'Sage', 'over-the-top', 'performance', 'Officer', 'Morning', 'wild', 'cowboy/take-no-prisoners-type', 'cop', 'people', 'first', 'questions', 'later', 'fact', 'suspect', 'Mr.', 'Sage', 'had', 'lot', 'fun', 'playing', 'role', 'However', 'Bill', 'Dawes', 'who', 'Officer', 'Francis', 'more', 'challenging', 'job', 'keeping', 'pace', 'Bill', 'Sage', 'performance', 'becoming', 'overshadowed', 'upstaged', 'Mr.', 'Dawes', 'pace', 'beautifully', 'actors', 'play', 'off', 'other', 'perfection', 'really', 'would', 'have', 'believed', 'were', 'true', 'cops', 'Bill', 'Dawes', 'absolutely', 'phenomenal', 'understated', 'role', 'Officer', 'Francis', '..a', 'sensitive', 'recently', 'transferred', 'cop', 'struggling', 'find', 'way', 'adjust', 'wild', 'ways', 'newly', 'assigned', 'partner.Bill', 'Dawes', 'certain', 'vulnerability', 'character', 'contemporary', 'actor', 'can', 'think', 'special', 'knack', 'being', 'able', 'portray', 'wide', 'range', 'emotions', 'particularly', 'talented', 'expressing', 'pensive', 'melancholy', 'fear', 'especially', 'evident', 'second', 'half', 'Chapter', '12', 'A', 'Close', 'Encounter', 'when', 'Officer', 'Francis', 'face', 'face', 'boy', 'laundry', 'room', 'who', 'gun', 'pointed', 'directly', 'immediately', 'followed', 'scene', 'later', 'evening', 'when', 'Francis', 'seen', 'alone', 'apartment', 'reflecting', 'earlier', 'near-death', 'experience', 'very', 'little', 'dialogue', 'two', 'scenes', 'yet', 'was', 'able', 'feel', 'Officer', 'Francis', 'fear/sadness/frustration/loneliness/pain/shortcomings', 'etc', 'Most', 'importantly', 'Mr.', 'Dawes', 'able', 'convey', 'emotions', 'expressions', 'body', 'language', 'less', '2', 'minutes', 'ever', 'saying', 'word', 'Being', 'able', 'do', 'acting', 'Being', 'able', 'do', 'as', 'well', 'TALENT', 'also', 'one-of-kind', 'vulnerable', 'pout', 'will', 'make', 'lady', 'heart', 'just', 'melt', 'first', 'half', 'Chapter', '9', 'Take', 'Cuffs', 'Off', 'Officer', 'Morning', 'Francis', 'ex-wife', 'just', 'stopped', 'speaking', 'one', 'day', 'sudden', 'downward', 'glance', 'heartbreaking', 'subtle', 'frown/pout', 'little', 'more', 'complicated', 'One', 'biggest', 'mysteries', 'modern', 'times', 'how', 'Mr.', 'Dawes', 'not', 'had', 'more', 'success', 'dramatic', 'actor', 'have', 'feeling', 'are', 'going', 'be', 'seeing', 'lot', 'more', 'highly', 'talented', 'actor', 'years', 'come', '..']",Evenhand

790622,A1C1BJD5L7WI6K,B00011V8BS,Stephen McMenamin,"[3, 3]","Evenhand is a very impressive accomplishment: a quiet, thoughtful cop film. Its premise is familiar: two very different personalities working to adapt to each other and to the many demands of their jobs as patrolmen. So it's very much a character study, and the two principal actors -- Bill Sage and Bill Dawes -- do an excellent job of realizing their characters. As the film's energy is derived from their characters' different natures, it would have been very easy for each of their performances to become charicatures. They did not. In each, you see a fully-dimensioned person, including echoes of his partner's traits. That's good acting of good writing.I also enjoyed the matter-of-fact style of the film, which reminded me of Victor Nunez's wonderful and under-appreciated Ruby In Paradise.",3,If John Sayles adapted a Joseph Wambaugh story...,1125014400,"08 26, 2005",2005,797,"['Evenhand', 'very', 'impressive', 'accomplishment', 'quiet', 'thoughtful', 'cop', 'film', 'premise', 'familiar', 'two', 'very', 'different', 'personalities', 'working', 'adapt', 'other', 'many', 'demands', 'jobs', 'patrolmen', 'very', 'much', 'character', 'study', 'two', 'principal', 'actors', 'Bill', 'Sage', 'Bill', 'Dawes', 'do', 'excellent', 'job', 'realizing', 'characters', 'film', 'energy', 'derived', 'characters', 'different', 'natures', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'very', 'easy', 'performances', 'become', 'charicatures', 'did', 'not', 'see', 'fully-dimensioned', 'person', 'including', 'echoes', 'partner', 'traits', 'good', 'acting', 'good', 'writing.I', 'also', 'enjoyed', 'matter-of-fact', 'style', 'film', 'reminded', 'Victor', 'Nunez', 'wonderful', 'under-appreciated', 'Ruby', 'Paradise']",Evenhand
790623,A38XW5668UKIJ6,B00011V8BS,Truth Crusader,"[0, 0]","Having retired from the job, I am pretty critical of cop movies. The film was a little rough around the edges with a few of the minor characters acting a little stiff, but even so I still thoroughly enjoyed it. The two main characters were excellent, and even though Officer Morning was sometimes a little bit over the top, he still seemed very real to me, as did his partner. Actually, I think all those who played the cops in the movie did a good job. If you are looking for a high speed action flick, this is not it. If you want to get a glimpse into the everyday life of a beat cop who works the rough side of town you should like this. Interesting Note: The person who plays Toby in the movie, in real life is a female (Io Tillett Wright ).",5,A Great Cop Movie,1392854400,"02 20, 2014",2014,745,"['Having', 'retired', 'job', 'am', 'pretty', 'critical', 'cop', 'movies', 'film', 'was', 'little', 'rough', 'edges', 'few', 'minor', 'characters', 'acting', 'little', 'stiff', 'even', 'so', 'still', 'thoroughly', 'enjoyed', 'two', 'main', 'characters', 'were', 'excellent', 'even', 'Officer', 'Morning', 'was', 'sometimes', 'little', 'bit', 'top', 'still', 'seemed', 'very', 'real', 'did', 'partner', 'Actually', 'think', 'who', 'played', 'cops', 'movie', 'did', 'good', 'job', 'are', 'looking', 'high', 'speed', 'action', 'flick', 'not', 'want', 'get', 'glimpse', 'everyday', 'life', 'beat', 'cop', 'who', 'rough', 'side', 'town', 'should', 'like', 'Interesting', 'Note', 'person', 'who', 'Toby', 'movie', 'real', 'life', 'female', 'Io', 'Tillett', 'Wright']",Evenhand
