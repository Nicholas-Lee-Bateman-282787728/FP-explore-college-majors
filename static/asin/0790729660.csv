They abduct a young girl and assault her. She is taken to a hospital. The men who did this are arrested. While walking to the courtroom Cobb and WIllard are greeted by the girl's father! A lawyer visits Mr. Carl Lee Hailey in jail. Lawyer Berganz seeks advice from an older lawyer. The Preliminary Hearing begins; ""not guilty by reason of insanity"". Their request for a change of venue is rejected. A law student from Boston meets Berganz to offer help as a researcher. The brother of Cobb meets the local Klan leader to make a request for help. ""Does that lawyer have a family?"" Will Hailey get a new lawyer? Will the Klan make trouble?Hailey's church collected a defense fund for him. Lawyer Berganz has a cash flow problem. A new lawyer visits Hailey, they talk about money. There is a threat against Berganz, his family takes a vacation. The judge denies a change of venue. There is a discussion over the death penalty with Berganz. The lawyers exercise their peremptory challenges. There is fighting in the street between opposing factions. The Klan burns down Berganz' home! Troops patrol the streets. But Berganz won't drop the case. The return of Max is like a symbol. The trial begins. Witnesses testify, the wounded deputy answers the questions, so does the state's psychiatrist. An assassin shoots a man by the courthouse. Law student Helen is abducted and tortured by the Klan, and tied to a pole until she is rescued. The defense psychiatrist testifies. Does he have a secret past? The prosecutor questions Hailey about the fate of Cobb and Willard.Berganz visits Helen in the hospital and they talk. His wife returns to Berganz and they talk. Berganz talks to Hailey in jail about the trial. The prosecutor aks for a guilty verdict. Berganz asks the jury to seek the truth. Justice comes from humans, who are imperfect. Berganz tells the jury about the little girl who was attacked. The verdict is announced. ""We won."" Some rejoice, others are disappointed. Will there a better future for the children?This is a very dramatic story and courtroom drama. I'm sure the book is even better. Does it echo ""An Anatomy of a Murder""? Both deal with pleading temporary insanity. You can see how the characters are made up to fit the story (it is still a good story). [Was an M-16 picked as part of a not-so hidden agenda?

Not only does the movie assemble some of the great  contemporary actors in roles that range from expressive to phenomenal, but  it also features a thought-provoking and extremely deep story from John  Grisham's first novel, which contains much more than meets the eye. Even  though some of the characters might be mistakenly taken for sterotypes, the  symbolism and subtlety visible in almost every scene more than makes up for  an apparently familliar nature of the main conflict.

At times one can see attempts to recreate and milk the genuine rage and drama of ""Mississippi Burning"" or the anger and impunity of ""Ghosts of Mississippi"", or a hybrid of those and bits and pieces of other movies of this genre. At other times it looks like its just trying to draw from the sex appeal and cheesy interaction of 2 of its main actors, Matthew McConaughey and Sandra Bullock. As a result this movie picks up the rear in that genre's list of movies for lack of originality, and the scattered hodge podge statements it tries to make. Some of my favorite actors are wasted, either by being given cliched dialogue, over acting, or being put there merely for their brand name with no script to support their presence. If this script is considered a great adaptation of a great book, then I have no interest in reading the book. I'm sure the idea and the premise looked good on paper. But the direction doesn't guide the story with any coherence or identity of its own.  Bullock is mere cheesecake and is unbelievable in her role, proving she's only worthy of b-grade ""Miss Congeniality"" type crud.  McConaughey over acts so much (as can be said for Keifer Sutherland and others) that it can be said he balances out the under acting of Patrick McGoohan, Kevin Spacey and Donald Sutherland. Samuel L. Jackson should be ashamed of himself of not only his worst performance ever, but also easily his worst choice of movies to participate in.  Even the extras in this movie are horrible. Enough can't be said about the terrible direction in this movie, equating elongated facial shots with drama to a fault, making Sergio Leone westerns look much more authentic by comparison. This is not ""a powerful film."" It's a powerful attempt at using a big name cast, a brand name book and a capable director to use material that they know would easily jerk the emotions of its audience, and in doing that they resort to all the cliches of this genre scattering the story line in so many directions, culminating in an over the top, pleading hunk of cheese summation scene by McConaughey that wouldn't hold water in any real court of justice. Maybe people claim greatness to this movie out of guilt, or because they haven't seen quality comparisons and classics like ""Mississippis Burning,"" that has both a great script and fabulous acting. I don't know. All I know is it tugs from so many hokey directions it takes the final scene to remind everyone how it started.

91747,A31ATJR2RAVD5G,0790729660,Christopher Engel,"[4, 11]","Really, the main problem with this film can be summed up like this: The good guys win because the jury feels bad for them. That is seriously the entire extent of why they win. The ultimate ruling given to Jackson's character is so wildly and mind-bogglingly illegal and stupid that the film manages to out-stupid other insanely misinformed legal thrillers like Fracture, another film that made absolutely no sense if it used real-world courtroom rules. This film manages to actually take it a step further by focusing almost exclusively on race relations, and educated moviegoers know by now that that never means anything good: Bad White people, good Black people, and no in-betweens. I knew there was a problem the second the two stereotypical hicks dumped off the girl they rape, and the first thing the girl says to her father is, ""I'm sorry I dropped the groceries, daddy!"" Seriously? We need more reason to pity her besides being, like, brutally raped? I'm sorry, but I'm pretty sure that's not a standard reaction to being kidnapped and gang-raped as a preteen by two sadists; the groceries probably aren't on her list of things to worry about by the end of it all. It's lines like those that make this film jump right into ""beyond stupid"" territory, but it's not until the end that we go into ""astronomically moronic"" territory.I'll make it real short. Jackson is accused of double homicide. His lawyer goes for the insanity defense, despite the fact that it was clearly premeditated and Jackson was in no way insane at any point before or during the crime. After generic racist-prosecutor Spacey gives his closing speech, we get the climax of the film when good-guy-lawyer defends his client, providing a total turnabout and proving that Jackson was insane.Oh, wait, no he doesn't. In fact, he tries to defend Jackson's insanity defense exactly zero times. Instead, he tells a touching story to the jury--so touching, in fact, that they feel bad enough for Jackson to let him go.Yes, this is what the legal system means in this film: If you feel bad enough for the perpetrator, it's okay to let him walk, despite that he's obviously guilty of every single charge against him without any question.See, the jury's job isn't to decide whether or not Jackson should or should not be convicted. It's their job to examine the evidence and determine whether or not he committed the crimes with which he's being charged. Jackson's lawyer has already stated he's going to get him off the hook with an insanity defense, but then ignores that plan completely, effectively admitting Jackson's guilt. It doesn't matter if Jackson's story is sad or not; the law really doesn't care what your personal reasons are when you commit double homicide with an M16, as well as wound a cop in the process of shooting a fully automatic assault rifle in a crowded room. No one cares why he did it, unless he can be considered insane at the time. He wasn't considered insane. That means he's as equally guilty if he walked into a school and shot two kindergartners enough times to kill them.Because the legal system is thrown into the drain pipe and the film exploits both Blacks and Whites as polar opposites, this film is unforgivable. Any good qualities it might have are totally overshadowed by its stunning disregard for the law and its horrendous moral polarizing of Whites and Blacks.Did I mention that a young girl's reaction to being brutally and sadistically gang-raped is ""I'm sorry I dropped the groceries, daddy!"" Yeah, I turned the film off soon after that, and it's extremely rare that I just fast-forward to the ending and hope it ends soon. I prefer films that don't try and fail to manipulate my emotions.",1,Unforgivably stupid and insulting to the audience's intelligence.,1326585600,"01 15, 2012",2012,3706,"['Really', 'main', 'problem', 'film', 'can', 'be', 'summed', 'up', 'good', 'guys', 'win', 'jury', 'feels', 'bad', 'seriously', 'entire', 'extent', 'why', 'win', 'ultimate', 'ruling', 'given', 'Jackson', 'character', 'so', 'wildly', 'mind-bogglingly', 'illegal', 'stupid', 'film', 'out-stupid', 'other', 'insanely', 'misinformed', 'legal', 'thrillers', 'Fracture', 'film', 'made', 'absolutely', 'sense', 'used', 'real-world', 'courtroom', 'rules', 'film', 'actually', 'take', 'step', 'further', 'focusing', 'almost', 'exclusively', 'race', 'relations', 'educated', 'moviegoers', 'know', 'now', 'never', 'anything', 'good', 'Bad', 'White', 'people', 'good', 'Black', 'people', 'in-betweens', 'knew', 'was', 'problem', 'second', 'two', 'stereotypical', 'hicks', 'dumped', 'off', 'girl', 'rape', 'first', 'thing', 'girl', 'father', ""'m"", 'sorry', 'dropped', 'groceries', 'daddy', 'Seriously', 'need', 'more', 'reason', 'pity', 'besides', 'being', 'brutally', 'raped', ""'m"", 'sorry', ""'m"", 'pretty', 'sure', 'not', 'standard', 'reaction', 'being', 'kidnapped', 'gang-raped', 'preteen', 'two', 'sadists', 'groceries', 'probably', 'are', ""n't"", 'list', 'things', 'worry', 'end', 'lines', 'make', 'film', 'jump', 'right', 'stupid', 'territory', 'not', 'end', 'go', 'astronomically', 'moronic', 'territory.I', ""'ll"", 'make', 'real', 'short', 'Jackson', 'accused', 'double', 'homicide', 'lawyer', 'insanity', 'defense', 'fact', 'was', 'clearly', 'premeditated', 'Jackson', 'was', 'way', 'insane', 'point', 'crime', 'generic', 'racist-prosecutor', 'Spacey', 'closing', 'speech', 'get', 'climax', 'film', 'when', 'good-guy-lawyer', 'client', 'providing', 'total', 'turnabout', 'proving', 'Jackson', 'was', 'insane.Oh', 'wait', ""n't"", 'fact', 'defend', 'Jackson', 'insanity', 'defense', 'exactly', 'zero', 'times', 'Instead', 'touching', 'story', 'jury', 'so', 'touching', 'fact', 'feel', 'bad', 'enough', 'Jackson', 'let', 'go.Yes', 'what', 'legal', 'system', 'film', 'feel', 'bad', 'enough', 'perpetrator', 'okay', 'let', 'walk', 'obviously', 'guilty', 'single', 'charge', 'question.See', 'jury', 'job', ""n't"", 'decide', 'not', 'Jackson', 'should', 'should', 'not', 'be', 'convicted', 'job', 'examine', 'evidence', 'determine', 'not', 'committed', 'crimes', 'being', 'charged', 'Jackson', 'lawyer', 'already', 'stated', 'going', 'get', 'off', 'hook', 'insanity', 'defense', 'then', 'plan', 'completely', 'effectively', 'admitting', 'Jackson', 'guilt', ""n't"", 'matter', 'Jackson', 'story', 'sad', 'not', 'law', 'really', ""n't"", 'care', 'what', 'personal', 'reasons', 'are', 'when', 'commit', 'double', 'homicide', 'M16', 'as', 'well', 'wound', 'cop', 'process', 'shooting', 'fully', 'automatic', 'assault', 'rifle', 'crowded', 'room', 'one', 'why', 'did', 'can', 'be', 'considered', 'insane', 'time', 'was', ""n't"", 'considered', 'insane', 'equally', 'guilty', 'walked', 'school', 'shot', 'two', 'kindergartners', 'enough', 'times', 'kill', 'legal', 'system', 'thrown', 'drain', 'pipe', 'film', 'Blacks', 'Whites', 'polar', 'opposites', 'film', 'unforgivable', 'good', 'qualities', 'might', 'have', 'are', 'totally', 'overshadowed', 'stunning', 'disregard', 'law', 'horrendous', 'moral', 'polarizing', 'Whites', 'Blacks.Did', 'mention', 'young', 'girl', 'reaction', 'being', 'brutally', 'sadistically', 'gang-raped', ""'m"", 'sorry', 'dropped', 'groceries', 'daddy', 'Yeah', 'turned', 'film', 'off', 'soon', 'extremely', 'rare', 'just', 'fast-forward', 'ending', 'hope', 'soon', 'prefer', 'films', 'do', ""n't"", 'try', 'fail', 'manipulate', 'emotions']",N/A

Rated ""R"" for language and violent content (including a scene dipicting the rape of a ten year old girl), the film contains not only strong content but strong performances from a number of ""A"" list stars.Samuel L. Jackson plays Carl Lee Hailey, the father of the raped girl who takes out his revenge against the rapists by shooting them in cold blood as they are being escorted to their arraignment.  Young and inexperienced local attorney, Jake Brigance (played by Matthew McConaughey in one of his first major roles) agrees to defend Carl Lee against the smarmey District Attroney Rufus Buckley (played by Kevin Spacey).  Brigance is helped with the case by the unlikely trio of Sandra Bullock (playing a well-to-do law student), Oliver Platt (a morally devoid divorce attorney) and Donald Sutherland (a drunken disbarred lawyer who gave Brigance his first job).  As the plot builds, the community begins to takes sides in the case.  The KKK is called in to intimidate Carl Lee's defense team and the NAACP enters to counteract the Klan's actions.In some reviews, the film is panned as being poorly written and unbelieveable.  This reviewer found the film fairly well done and true to the book.  Without revealing any key plot details, let me suffice to say that the film is true to the novel and portrays the Deep South in a accurate way.

A young black girl, ten years old, is raped and beaten by two white red-necks and when the young girls father (Samuel L. Jackson) takes revenge into his own hands and murders the two men resposible he's arrested and a trial is held.

The film calls into account morality over law...whats right and wrong isn't always black and white and not so easily determined.  Acting on all fronts is strong, but it's Jackson who proves to be the light in this film as his tortured father suffers with every breath as he recounts what his baby went through.

91759,A2198FZZMTJ38H,0790729660,D. Litton,"[9, 11]","Employing an all-star cast and a well-nuanced story, John Grisham's &quot;A Time To Kill&quot; throws so much at the audience that I found myself wanting more and more from it. Besides being a carefully plotted law drama, it contains powerful situations relating to racism, situations that incite us to consider our own opinions on the subject matter it deals with.The story takes place in Canton, Mississippi, as two area men are arrested for the rape and attempted murder of a ten-year-old black girl. While not shown in explicit detail, the scene of the actual crime is brutal and haunting, as the victim cries out for her father amidst the degradation brought upon her by these two loathsome animals. This scene sets up the audience's understanding for the following action committed by her father, Carl Lee Hailey (Samuel L. Jackson), who breaks into the court house the night before the hearing and guns them down in cold blood.Or was it cold blood? The movie will spend its entire playing this out. As the discussion of Carl Hailey's guilt or innocence is on the lips of every citizen in Canton, attorney Jake Brigance (Matthew McConaughey) begins his struggle to prove that Carl's actions were justifiable due to his rage. Pitfall after pitfall awaits him at every corner: his wife becomes fearful and takes their daughter to her grandparents' home, the now-outraged Ku Klux Klan leaves burning crosses on his front lawn, and everyone keeps urging him to drop the case.This is where the movie's strong characterization really takes flight. Jake shows great strength of character, and a willpower that gives the movie its own sense of stability, while Carl is not shown as a small-minded black man whose crimes become too much to bear for him, but as someone who cares more for his family's welfare than for his own. This is proven in a scene in which the NAACP wishes to supply Carl with a more experienced lawyer using church-raised funds, to which Carl replies, &quot;Why have you not given my family this money?&quot;These characters come to life under well-acted performances. McConaughey's embodiment of determination and his character's striving to succeed is convincing and moving. Jackson carries with him a dignity and knowledge that gives us a better understanding of his family life, and by extension his reasons for his actions. Sandra Bullock makes an appearance during much of the second half as a law student out to aide Jake in his search for viable clues, while Kevin Spacey delivers a perfectly snide performance as the district attorney who may or may not be racist.The racial issues at hand are handled effectively enough to instill a sense of unease during much of the trial. As the Ku Klux Klan continues to vandalize the lives of anti-racist citizens, the defense struggles with the task of convincing the jury to look at Carl's crime, not his skin color.

In grand Grisham fashion it's over the top, yet this legal thriller is still fun to watch.  Set in a Mississippi small town, where a distraught African-American father (Samuel L. Jackson) takes justice into his own hands by killing the two Deliverance-type rednecks who raped his daughter, the film then explores all the racial tensions during the father's first-degree murder trial.  The trial draws the ire of the Klan, thus there are demonstrations, blood in the streets, threats made, people beaten up, houses destroyed, burning crosses in lawns--I could go on and on.  The film becomes a microcosm of contrived stereotypes as it lashes out violently in predictable scene after scene--but again, it moves along at a pulse-pounding pace, and the courtroom drama is very good.Including Jackson, A TIME TO KILL has an all-star cast, featuring a young Matthew McConaughey as the defense attorney perhaps a little in over his head; Sandra Bullock as the idealistic, Northeastern liberal legal assistant; Donald Sutherland as a drunken mentor; and son Kiefer Sutherland as a sneering, menacing racist.  Oh, Ashley Judd sweats grandly in an un-air conditioned home as McConaughey's brooding, silent suffering wife.  An over the top, contrived celebration of negative stereotypes, A TIME TO KILL still packs considerable entertainment value.--D.

He plays a lawyer struggling with what is right as he  puts his life and the lives of others on the line defending a man who  committed a crime he could have stopped.  Add in that his wife (Ashley  Judd) and daughter are distancing themselves and he has the lovely Miss  Rourke (Sandra Bullock) as his assitant and you have one heck of a family  dilemma.Racial tensions heat up between the NAACP, KKK and local  community members over the racially charged case.Charles s.

His off-beat  divorce attorney character will have you laughing as he offers some comedic  relief to a very emotionally enveloping drama.The Sutherland clan are on  two ends of the spectrum in this movie and both deliver with very little  room to work in their supporting roles.This movie is a bit violent in a  few scenes and I would steer children away from it, but this story is a  must see for everyone else.

Two white &quot;red-neck&quot; males find this poor defenseless  negro girl and throw beer cans at her.  They then grab her and throw her in  the back of the truck.

Listen to this:The protagonist (Samuel L. Jackson) is a man who guns down in broad daylight the two thugs who have raped his daughter. In the process he winds up shooting the leg off an innocent policeman who was accompanying the prisoners. Jackson is thus the 'hero' of the story. And in case we are in any doubt about it, when the one-legged cop takes the stand for the prosecution, he actually comes right out and bellows at the jury 'He's a hero!'. Thus we are asked to believe that a policeman who was permanently crippled in a murderous attack will commend his attacker for his homicidal actions. Remember, bearing in mind the insult-to-intelligence thing, that this is: (1) a law-enforcement officer (2) in a court of law (3) commending the man who committed a capital crime. Good one, Joel.But it doesn't end there. The man's lawyer (Matthew McConaghey) decides to cobble together a defence of not guitly by ... temporary insanity. Leaving aside for the moment that this is possibly the weakest defense one can insult a judge with (to wit: 'I was insane, your honour, but just for the few seconds during which I was killing those people and wouldn't have done it otherwise'), there is another difficulty. This 'temporarily insane' defendant seems to have been exceedingly well-prepared for his moment of madness, hiding out in a dark crevice of the courthouse all night with a firearm and suddenly leaping out (in slow-motion of course) to gun down his victims.But these obstacles are not enough to overcome. McConaghey must be faced with disappearing funds, a highly partial judge, a largely white jury, a killer D.A. making huge political capital out of the case, several failed witnesses, attacks by the Klan which culminate in the torching of his house, and a witness-box performance by the defendant that all but seals the prosecution's case.The key piece of advice that he needs that might just win the day comes from his own 'temporarily insane' client: he has to make the jury close its eyes (yes, literally) and imagine that Jackson's daughter is white.So: a story that's presumably all about racial injustice boils down to this: can our heroes get a white jury to agree that if it was their daughter, they might gun down two guys too (and thus not deserve to go to prison)? For Pete's sake, even the title of the film is semi-exculpatory. (Remember: the temporary insanity plea has evaporated at this point.)It's like the Ladybird book of Race Relations, isn't it? Can McConaghey do it?

The reporting of an act of violence by an African American father whose daughter had been kidnapped, brutally beaten, raped, and further debased brings together a rookie lawyer whose involvement with the father during the prolonged trial results in a suggestion that there may be hope for harmony, even on a small scale, if the racial lines can be erased or even blurred a bit.Matthew McConaughey is the rookie white lawyer, Ashley Judd his wife, Samuel Jackson the father, Sandra Bullock the bright wannabe lawyer who assists McConaughey, Kevin Spacey the brilliant but slimy lawyer opposing McConaughey, Oliver Platt as McConaughey's sidekick, Donald Sutherland as the disbarred drunk of a lawyer who cleans up his act to help McConaughey find the truth justice knows, Patrick McGoohan as the implacable judge, and Kiefer Sutherland as the KKK redneck representing all the evil of the little southern town. It is a fine cast and Schumacher moves them naturally between their lives in the town and the interior of the courtroom with great facility.Perhaps this will never be considered as one of the 'Great Movies', but is certainly pleads the case for understanding and for putting an end to the evils of racial bias.

It was 1996 and McConaughey headlined the film version of John Grisham's first novel to more than $100 million in US gross, a heady figure for an R-rated courtroom drama that explores racial tension and capital punishment.McConaughey stars as Jake Brigance, a young, hotshot Mississippi lawyer. His client is Samuel L. Jackson as Carl Lee Hailey, a blue-collar father on trial for delivering M-16 justice on two men who beat and raped his 10-year-old daughter, Tonya.Surrounding McConaughey and Jackson is a solid cast - Sandra Bullock as Ellen Roarke, a Boston law student and volunteer aide; Kevin Spacey as Rufus Buckley, a shark-toothed district attorney; Donald Sutherland as Lucien Wilbanks, a disbarred and drunken mentor of Jake's; Ashley Judd as Jake's wife; Patrick McGoohan as a prosecutor's dream judge (aptly named ""Noose""); and Oliver Platt as Harry Rex Vonner, a disreputable lawyer and Jake's best friend.The amazing depth of supporting actors also includes Keifer Sutherland (24), Chris Cooper (Adaptation), Charles Dutton, Brenda Fricker, M. Emmet Walsh, Kurtwood Smith (That '70s Show) and Anthony Heald (The Silence of the Lambs).The movie runs nearly two-and-a-half hours, which allows plenty of time for each actor to steal a scene, if not two. Director Joel Schumacher skillfully builds tension - often, outside the courtroom - while maintaining a pace that keeps the movie entertaining and thought provoking instead of a preachy diatribe. ""A Time to Kill"" is R-rated for good reason; yet neither the adult language or violence feels gratuitous given the storyline.I strongly recommend Grishham's novelA Time to Killif you enjoy the movie. The movie necessitated changing the book's climactic scene and yet both versions work in their own form.In summary, despite the fact that ""A Time to Kill"" remains overshadowed by the box office receipts and celebrity found in other Grisham films, this movie has aged well. It is a treat to watch McConaughey, Jackson and Spacey. The depth of acting talent brought together for this film is stunning; you'll find yourself recognizing many faces that can attribute their later success in part to their role in this movie.Rating: Five stars",5,Grisham adaptation ages well with an amazing cast and stellar performances,1291334400,"12 3, 2010",2010,2330,"['Do', 'remember', 'when', 'Matthew', 'McConaughey', 'was', 'more', 'walking', 'Mexican', 'beer', 'holder', 'six-pack', 'abs', 'George', 'Hamilton', 'tan', 'was', '1996', 'McConaughey', 'headlined', 'film', 'version', 'John', 'Grisham', 'first', 'novel', 'more', '100', 'million', 'US', 'gross', 'heady', 'figure', 'R-rated', 'courtroom', 'drama', 'racial', 'tension', 'capital', 'punishment.McConaughey', 'stars', 'Jake', 'Brigance', 'young', 'hotshot', 'Mississippi', 'lawyer', 'client', 'Samuel', 'L.', 'Jackson', 'Carl', 'Lee', 'Hailey', 'blue-collar', 'father', 'trial', 'delivering', 'M-16', 'justice', 'two', 'men', 'who', 'beat', 'raped', '10-year-old', 'daughter', 'Tonya.Surrounding', 'McConaughey', 'Jackson', 'solid', 'cast', 'Sandra', 'Bullock', 'Ellen', 'Roarke', 'Boston', 'law', 'student', 'volunteer', 'aide', 'Kevin', 'Spacey', 'Rufus', 'Buckley', 'shark-toothed', 'district', 'attorney', 'Donald', 'Sutherland', 'Lucien', 'Wilbanks', 'disbarred', 'drunken', 'mentor', 'Jake', 'Ashley', 'Judd', 'Jake', 'wife', 'Patrick', 'McGoohan', 'prosecutor', 'dream', 'judge', 'aptly', 'named', 'Noose', 'Oliver', 'Platt', 'Harry', 'Rex', 'Vonner', 'disreputable', 'lawyer', 'Jake', 'best', 'friend.The', 'amazing', 'depth', 'supporting', 'actors', 'also', 'Keifer', 'Sutherland', '24', 'Chris', 'Cooper', 'Adaptation', 'Charles', 'Dutton', 'Brenda', 'Fricker', 'M.', 'Emmet', 'Walsh', 'Kurtwood', 'Smith', ""'70s"", 'Show', 'Anthony', 'Heald', 'Silence', 'Lambs', '.The', 'movie', 'runs', 'nearly', 'two-and-a-half', 'hours', 'plenty', 'time', 'actor', 'steal', 'scene', 'not', 'two', 'Director', 'Joel', 'Schumacher', 'skillfully', 'tension', 'often', 'courtroom', 'maintaining', 'pace', 'movie', 'entertaining', 'thought', 'provoking', 'instead', 'preachy', 'diatribe', 'Time', 'Kill', 'R-rated', 'good', 'reason', 'adult', 'language', 'violence', 'feels', 'gratuitous', 'given', 'storyline.I', 'strongly', 'recommend', 'Grishham', 'novelA', 'Time', 'Killif', 'enjoy', 'movie', 'movie', 'necessitated', 'changing', 'book', 'climactic', 'scene', 'yet', 'versions', 'work', 'own', 'form.In', 'summary', 'fact', 'Time', 'Kill', 'overshadowed', 'box', 'office', 'receipts', 'celebrity', 'found', 'other', 'Grisham', 'films', 'movie', 'aged', 'well', 'treat', 'watch', 'McConaughey', 'Jackson', 'Spacey', 'depth', 'acting', 'talent', 'brought', 'together', 'film', 'stunning', ""'ll"", 'find', 'recognizing', 'many', 'can', 'attribute', 'later', 'success', 'part', 'role', 'movie.Rating', 'Five', 'stars']",N/A

Let me explain.In the real world bad things happen, as was the case with the little girl in the film, but this film doesn't stop with that. A Time to Kill goes on with one terrible thing after another, almost as if the town in this film were reaping some kind of Godly wrath on the same lines of the Pharoah of Exodus. I sometimes imagine the director, writers, and staff as some kind of Beavis and Butthead characters saying to one another, ""hey, uuuh, let's try this, that will make the film really cool."" I never read A Time To Kill but something tells me Grisham didn't create all the many climatic events in this film. First we have the rape. Then we have Jackson's character in jail - for shooting and killing the two men, as well as paralyzing the poor guard who stood by. Then Matt M's character almost gets his house blown up, and almost has an affair. Then we have his house getting burned down - pardon me if I mix up the order. Then Saundra B gets kidnapped and left for dead...by a cop who is secretly hanging with the KKK boys in his free time. Then a poor national guard soldier is sniped down and killed - or paralized - I forget. During that sequence, we hear Matthew M's character saying the equation of , ""poor soldier, he got shot for me."" WOW, talk about an understatement. Oh yeah, there's a race war that involves the KKK - you read me right - and ends with the Grand Dragon of the KKK getting burned to death. Does any of this sound like...how should I put it.... A BIT TOO MUCH?!?!?! I didn't even mention Matthew M and Ashley Judd's near divorce or the black NAACP lawyer who looks...a wee bit purple?But hey, this film will make you cry, as it did for me, but tears don't make a film. Judging by all raving reviews of this film, however, I guess one impossibility after another does make a great film though. Enjoy. Oh, and next time you watch this movie, notice how quickly they fast forward past the poor national guard soldier.

When two white men brutally rape his daughter, he decides to kill them and he does - in front of witnesses. The hot-shot DA (Kevin Spacey) is almost guaranteed a murder conviction, and novice attorney Jake Brigance (Matthew McConaughey) decides to defend Carl Lee.This movie is so full of top-notch actors I expected to be swept up in the story and moved by it, but I wasn't; many of the actors are wasted and I kept wondering if it would ever end. Although Sandra Bullock gets top billing, she doesn't become involved in the film until an hour and fifteen minutes in, and then she's in and out and has nothing to do but look good. McConaughey is the star; he's perfect as a young Atticus Finch-type and definitely the best part of the movie. Spacey is mesmerizing as always in his off-beat way, but he plays a one-dimensional bad guy. The wonderful Chris Cooper is wasted in a small part, as are Donald and Keifer Sutherland and Ashley Judd. Oliver Platt is just annoying as Jake's buffoonish buddy.It's way too slow-moving as every nuance of courtroom protocol is tediously explored, while the rampant racial hatred of the town could have been an exciting movie all by itself. The trial's outcome is never really in doubt, but still it's a surprising verdict.

Even though being from the deep South I know with certainty that a great deal of the elements in this movie are the brutal truth. However, it's more than that, it's about LOYALTY! REVENGE! JUSTICE! and a FATHER'S LOVE! for his child. It goes deeper than it being about the rape of a black girl by white guys. Don't get me wrong, that part is very prevalent to the movie. I just think that any father in his position would've done the same thing if his daughter was brutalized the way this man's little girl was. That's a father's love, and any real father will defend his own. My dad would've done the same thing without thinking twice about it. Not saying that makes it right, but I know there wasn't a dry eye in the house while Matthew McConaughey was doing his closing agruements, and describing in graphic detail what this poor child went through at the hands of these grown men. This is a hard thing for any woman to deal with anyway, but to rip innocence from a child is just plain sick and monsterous. So, Carl Lee put them down like rabid bloodthirsty cannines. Seriously, They almost ripped that poor kid apart, wrecked her from inside out, almost beat her to death and then had the nerve to be gleeful about it on their way out the courtroom. Don't get me wrong, I know it isn't anyone's place to take the law into their own hands, nor think it's o.k to kill someone just because they may feel like it. However, I do think they deserved it, and that justice was served. Frankly, instead of jail they should've given him a medal. I know this review is gonna upset a lot of people, but I gotta keep it real. It doesn't matter if the father were black, white, brown, purple, or blue he still probably would've done the same thing. It's just sad that people can't understand that this girl was only done like this because she was black and no other reason.

Made only eight years ago I'd think today you'd break the bank putting together:Matthew McConaugheySandra BullockSamuel L. JacksonKevin SpaceyOliver PlattCharles DuttonDonald SutherlandKiefer SutherlandPatrick McGoohanAshley JuddChris CooperThe story is in some ways rather straightforward.  Samuel Jackson's 10 year old daughter is raped and tortured by two rednecks in the opening minutes.  Mercifully, the girl lives through the event and the two rednecks are arrested. Thinking that in Mississippi they're going to be acquitted ""like them boys raped that girl last year"" Samuel's Carl Lee Haley asks Matthew's Southern Lawyer Jake Brigance if he'd ""help him out if he got into some trouble"", then takes an M-16 and shoots the rednecks on the way to a court hearing, destroying Deputy Chris Cooper's leg in the process.The rest of the movie seems pretty straight-forward, almost predictably so.  Jake is tasked with defending a black man in Mississippi of murders which were committed in full sight of many people, including Jake himself and several law officers.  Kiefer Sutherland, as the brother of one of the rednecks, enlists the assistance of the Klan to make sure that Carl ""gets it"" and to make sure that anyone attempting to help Carl is also intimidated (killed.... houses burned.... etc....) In this movie the Klan is a living, breathing entity with apparently much leeway to conduct its nefarious business.Donald Sutherland is the alcoholic lawyer mentor of Jake - disbarred for some police violence during some political activism.  Kevin Spacey is the ambitious District Attorney with a nomination for Governor in his back pocket.  Charles Dutton is the black sheriff who doesn't hesitate to stand toe to toe with the Klan - the scenes where Klan members are in any way subdued are due to this strong character.  Ashley Judd is Jake's pretty Mississippi Sorority-Belle wife who initially thinks that Jake accepts Carl Lee's case to ""prove what a big-time lawyer"" he is. When the Klan tries bombing Jake's house Ashley packs up their daughter and heads to the grandparent's house.  On the first day of the case a hotshot law student comes wheeling into town, played by Sandra Bullock, wanting to make her name stamping out the death penalty.The story is told in a linear fashion, but the performances make this compelling stuff.  The NAACP come to town to provide for Carl's defense, and the scene where Carl tells them ""thanks but no thanks"" brings a new closeness to Carl and Jake.  The movie provides for some riveting moments from Jackson as Carl and McConaughey as Jake.  I've read that Mr. McConaughey delivered the summation scene in a single take.  It is an astonishing piece of acting.  There are several shots of extras crying, and I can't help but wonder if this wasn't an honest response to his performance.There is a scene before the last trial scene where Carl tells Jake that he has hung onto him as his lawyer because ""you one of the bad guys, Jake.  I needs the jury to see me like you see me"". If there is a weakness in the way that the story is told, it's that the whole movie is told the way the all-white jury would see it.  The other black characters are brief and one-dimensional.  Carl Lee's wife is in several scenes - looking concerned but with almost no dialogue.  Since her daughter is raped and tortured and her husband is on trial, shouldn't we care as much about what SHE thinks as Jake's wife?  We spend a fair amount of time watching what the Klan is doing. Shouldn't we be at least as interested in what the black community is doing?Jake sets out to ""prove a black man can get a fair trial in Mississippi"".  But can he prove that vigilante justice is ok even if everyone in the community knows that in race-hate-crimes in the world of this film black people can't expect fair treatment?The movie reverberates with echoes of ""To Kill a Mockingbird"".  Or at least it wants to.

91828,A3U3BEZMH3F01Q,0790729660,maskirovka,"[10, 22]","""A Time to Kill"" is in my opinion an abomination of a movie.  It asks the audience to say that a man whose daughter is viciously raped by two subhumans is entitled to illegally obtain an M-16 automatic rifle, hide in the courthouse where the two accused rapists are being arraigned, and then fire said M-16 on full automatic, killing not only the two suspects (who are handcuffed and sitting ducks) but also grievously wounding a police officer who was escorting them.What makes all of this okay to Grisham, the author of the novel ""A Time to Kill"" and to the producers of this movie is that the suspected rapists are white and the victim of their assault and her father are black.  Somehow, that makes it all okay.  It's almost as if Grisham and company think that black people are entitled to carry out a few lynchings because they've frequently been the victims of them.  ""A Time to Kill"" carries this out to ludicrous extremes...even the police officer wounded in the indiscriminate assault forgives the father...despite the fact that he had to have a leg amputated because of the wound he sustained in the attack.  If I was an innocent bystander who was injured in attack like that, it wouldn't matter if the killer had the best reasons in the world to do what he did...I wouldn't be able to just write off the loss of my leg to good will.For those who think this mercifully fictional story is a good one with a satisfactory ending (the killer gets a walk), I have a challenge for them...switch around the races.  If the killer and his daughter were white and the two perps were black would that still make for a good story?  Hardly...from coast to coast, the politically correct would be denouncing ""A Time to Kill"" as a justification of lynching (which it is).  And God forbid if something like it ever happened in real life.  Reverend Al Sharpton and Jesse Jackson would never shut up about how justice had been subverted.Think about what this movie asks us to endorse.  A horrible rape of a child takes place.  The law apprehends two men who probably did it.  The justice system spools up in all of its majesty to determine their guilt or innocence and exact justice.  But the murderer who Grisham and company ask us to embrace says ""Sorry, I won't wait around for that"" and kills the two suspected rapists while they are in handcuffs before the justice system has even been given a chance to act (if the movie had had the father killing them after the justice system failed ""A Time to Kill"" might have been an interesting and worthwhile movie).  And he does so in a courthouse and in a manner where any number of innocent people (besides the police officer who was turned into a cripple by him) could have been killed or injured.  And Grisham and the makers of this movie ask us to believe that his acquittal is ""justice.""Maybe it is for them, but it sure isn't for me.  So if you believe in equal application of the law and abhor vigilante action and lynchings, avoid this movie.p",1,Lynching is okay...if it's done for politically correct reasons.,1252368000,"09 8, 2009",2009,2991,"['Time', 'Kill', 'opinion', 'abomination', 'movie', 'audience', 'say', 'man', 'daughter', 'viciously', 'raped', 'two', 'subhumans', 'entitled', 'illegally', 'obtain', 'M-16', 'automatic', 'rifle', 'hide', 'courthouse', 'where', 'two', 'accused', 'rapists', 'are', 'being', 'arraigned', 'then', 'fire', 'said', 'M-16', 'full', 'automatic', 'killing', 'not', 'only', 'two', 'suspects', 'who', 'are', 'handcuffed', 'sitting', 'ducks', 'also', 'grievously', 'wounding', 'police', 'officer', 'who', 'was', 'escorting', 'them.What', 'okay', 'Grisham', 'author', 'novel', 'Time', 'Kill', 'producers', 'movie', 'suspected', 'rapists', 'are', 'white', 'victim', 'assault', 'father', 'are', 'black', 'Somehow', 'okay', 'almost', 'Grisham', 'company', 'think', 'black', 'people', 'are', 'entitled', 'carry', 'out', 'few', 'lynchings', ""'ve"", 'frequently', 'been', 'victims', 'Time', 'Kill', 'ludicrous', 'extremes', 'even', 'police', 'officer', 'wounded', 'indiscriminate', 'assault', 'father', 'fact', 'had', 'have', 'leg', 'amputated', 'wound', 'sustained', 'attack', 'was', 'innocent', 'bystander', 'who', 'was', 'injured', 'attack', 'would', ""n't"", 'matter', 'killer', 'had', 'best', 'reasons', 'world', 'do', 'what', 'did', 'would', ""n't"", 'be', 'able', 'just', 'write', 'off', 'loss', 'leg', 'good', 'will.For', 'who', 'think', 'mercifully', 'fictional', 'story', 'good', 'one', 'satisfactory', 'ending', 'killer', 'walk', 'have', 'challenge', 'switch', 'races', 'killer', 'daughter', 'were', 'white', 'two', 'perps', 'were', 'black', 'would', 'still', 'make', 'good', 'story', 'Hardly', 'coast', 'coast', 'politically', 'correct', 'would', 'be', 'denouncing', 'Time', 'Kill', 'justification', 'lynching', 'God', 'forbid', 'something', 'ever', 'happened', 'real', 'life', 'Reverend', 'Al', 'Sharpton', 'Jesse', 'Jackson', 'would', 'never', 'shut', 'up', 'how', 'justice', 'had', 'been', 'subverted.Think', 'what', 'movie', 'endorse', 'horrible', 'rape', 'child', 'place', 'law', 'two', 'men', 'who', 'probably', 'did', 'justice', 'system', 'up', 'majesty', 'determine', 'guilt', 'innocence', 'exact', 'justice', 'murderer', 'who', 'Grisham', 'company', 'ask', 'embrace', 'Sorry', 'wo', ""n't"", 'wait', 'around', 'two', 'suspected', 'rapists', 'are', 'handcuffs', 'justice', 'system', 'even', 'been', 'given', 'chance', 'act', 'movie', 'had', 'had', 'father', 'killing', 'justice', 'system', 'failed', 'Time', 'Kill', 'might', 'have', 'been', 'interesting', 'worthwhile', 'movie', 'so', 'courthouse', 'manner', 'where', 'number', 'innocent', 'people', 'police', 'officer', 'who', 'was', 'turned', 'cripple', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'killed', 'injured', 'Grisham', 'makers', 'movie', 'believe', 'acquittal', 'justice', 'Maybe', 'sure', ""n't"", 'So', 'believe', 'equal', 'application', 'law', 'abhor', 'vigilante', 'action', 'lynchings', 'avoid', 'movie.p']",N/A

And it does their need for mythology good to believe that a black man can shoot a white man's leg off, then be tried in a white courtroom and not one riot breaks out. Not one! And the fact that a white man was tried for the rape of a 10 year old black girl is an even BIGGER distortion of reality: no white man has EVER been given the death penalty for the rape of a BLACK WOMAN in the south. Likewise, white boys raping young black girls was not viewed as &quot;perversion&quot; on the part of most white folks. They sat back, just as they did the lynchings, and engaged in &quot;benign neglect.&quot;This movie should be shown in all Black Studies classes around the nation as to what DIDN'T take place in race relations. Grisham's mind is as warped as George Lucas' in terms of myths. Lucas created Jar Jar Binx, a futuristic Stephin Fetchit, then lied and claimed he made it up.

For starters, it's 143 minutes long, and it doesn't say anywhere on the DVD case that it's half the film on one side of the disc, and half the film on the other. Guess who started watching the second half of the film without realising?! You would have thought the fact it starts abruptly and there's no credit should have warned me! (Does it sound even more stupid that I understood the second half of the film like it was a stand alone film?!)There's an all star cast in this, and the main reason I bought this was because of Sandra Bullock, and then put off watching it for ages. I saw The Firm years ago (Tom Cruise phase), but it was garbage. So I wasn't looking forward to another John Grisham novel turned into a movie. What this movie really lacks is any cute guys. I'm sorry but Matthew McConaughey with all the curly hair does nothing for me! Also included in the cast are: Samuel L. Jackson (in a mesmerising role: ""Yes, they deserve to die, and I hope they burn in Hell!!!""), Kevin Spacey, Oliver Platt (doing some serious backcombing), Brenda Fricker, Donald Sutherland, Kiefer Sutherland (imagine an extension of his role in Phone Booth, except worse - a real nasty piece of work), and Ashley Judd. Strangely enough, most of these actors are severely underused: Sandra's top billing, but is underbilled, and does little more than look pretty and turn up for no reason. Ashley Judd is sent away so her hubby & Sandra can get it on. Kevin Spacey yells ""Objection your honour!"" a lot and not much else, in a case that he had no chance of winning anyway.The sterotypical Southern town is well overdone. There's no mention of the fact that they could have air conditioning, instead of looking all hot & sweaty most of the time. Most of the time, you get the feeling the entire film is trying to be racist, ignorant and exploitive.

And while I enjoyed it at the time, this morning I woke up with a negative perspective.First, I agree with other critics about the stereotyping of races. It is a deep flaw in the film.Second, notice how sleazy the protagonists are. Bullock and McConaughey have an affair and then he gets back his wife with no repercussions at all. No moral dilemma or price to pay.Third, Bullock is a shallow smart-alecky character impossible to empathize with. The trial for her is just an intellectual game.Fourth, the depiction of whites is deplorably degrading. I noticed a very interesting thing that the screenwriter is Akiva Goldsman, who I believe is an Orthodox Jew and ardent Zionist.Goldsman also wrote the screenplay for that travesty of historical distortion Da Vince Code. And note how the anti-Christian themes in this film are really played up, especially the prominent Christian symbolism of the Klan and the greed and dishonesty of the black pastor.Now imagine transplanting this film to Goldsman's beloved and sacrosanct Israel, where Samuel Jackson is a Palestinian farmer whose daughter has been raped by Israeli soldiers or crushed to death when they bulldoze his home. Then he decides to go out and kill the soldiers or blow up an army base in revenge. Such a story would be brutally repressed in Israel. LOL!I don't know how faithful this film is to Grisham's book which I haven't read. Lately I have been very dissatisfied with Grisham's writing.

91836,A2VGKGXSG81KAS,0790729660,Michael J. Berquist,"[12, 19]","John Grisham novels are difficult to rate as movies. On one hand Grisham's work translates to well to pop culture that his books are almost cinematic. On the other, the &quot;book-is-never-as-good-as-the-movie&quot;-ism  applies. Some of Grisham's books have been quite good- &quot;The Firm&quot;  was a terrifically exciting movie (Tom Cruise was letter-perfect for the  role of Mitch McDeere), and &quot;The Rainmaker&quot; (which gave Matt  Damon his start) certainly surprised me with a touching story of an  underdog who upsets the system. Some have been mediocre to bad- &quot;The  Pelican Brief&quot; and &quot;The Chamber&quot; fit the latter category,  &quot;The Client&quot; the former. &quot;A Time to Kill&quot;, in my  opinion, is the best of them all because the author gives his audience a  tough choice to make about what justice is. Pack in some sterling acting  performances and this is one pretty darn good movie.The plot? After his  young daughter is viciously raped and assaulted by rednecks (no, John  Rocker doesn't have a cameo), Samuel L. Jackson guns down the two  assailents on their way to court. He is subsequently put on trial by the  local DA, and defended by an idealistic white attorney. Jackson's trial  becomes a swirling tempest for local hatreds to be aired.Director Joel  Schumacher certainly surprised me with good work, despite being the man who  made &quot;Batman &amp; Robin&quot;. It helps to assemble some serious  acting talent- Samuel L. Jackson and Kevin Spacey (the DA) are both  recognized actors (Spacey having won an Oscar for &quot;The Usual  Suspects&quot;, and Jackson is *long* overdue for getting one himself), so  the big surprise was Matthew McConaughey's sterling performance as the  idealistic, passionate attorney who defends Jackson. McConaughey is a  terrific actor- laid back, easy-going but with just enough passion and  intensity. This movie put him on the map and it is easy to see why he is a  talent in demand. Sandra Bullock and Ashley Judd have roles here but don't  make much of an impression. Donald Sutherland and Keifer both have parts  too- the former as Matthew McConaughey's mentor (a role he's quite good in,  incidentally) and the latter as a local redneck.Finally, a word about  the plot: the best movies give us a sticky problem that can't be resolved  easily. The tricky choice in &quot;Crimson Tide&quot; is a beautiful  example of a decision that could go either way and gives the audience  something to debate about afterwards. Here we're given a tricky choice-  vengeance or justice? Do we acquit Samuel L. Jackson because in our hearts  he did what we all would do in his place? Or do we punish him for taking  the law into his own hands? It's a rough choice to make, and the movie  refuses to give us an easy answer.Well done.",4,A fine film,953942400,"03 25, 2000",2000,2815,"['John', 'Grisham', 'novels', 'are', 'difficult', 'rate', 'movies', 'one', 'hand', 'Grisham', 'work', 'well', 'pop', 'culture', 'books', 'are', 'almost', 'cinematic', 'other', 'quot', 'book-is-never-as-good-as-the-movie', 'quot', '-ism', 'applies', 'Grisham', 'books', 'have', 'been', 'quite', 'good-', 'quot', 'Firm', 'quot', 'was', 'terrifically', 'exciting', 'movie', 'Tom', 'Cruise', 'was', 'letter-perfect', 'role', 'Mitch', 'McDeere', 'quot', 'Rainmaker', 'quot', 'gave', 'Matt', 'Damon', 'start', 'certainly', 'surprised', 'touching', 'story', 'underdog', 'who', 'system', 'have', 'been', 'mediocre', 'bad-', 'quot', 'Pelican', 'Brief', 'quot', 'quot', 'Chamber', 'quot', 'fit', 'latter', 'category', 'quot', 'Client', 'quot', 'former', 'quot', 'Time', 'Kill', 'quot', 'opinion', 'best', 'author', 'audience', 'tough', 'choice', 'make', 'what', 'justice', 'Pack', 'sterling', 'acting', 'performances', 'one', 'pretty', 'darn', 'good', 'movie.The', 'plot', 'young', 'daughter', 'viciously', 'raped', 'assaulted', 'rednecks', 'John', 'Rocker', ""n't"", 'have', 'cameo', 'Samuel', 'L.', 'Jackson', 'down', 'two', 'assailents', 'way', 'court', 'subsequently', 'put', 'trial', 'local', 'DA', 'defended', 'idealistic', 'white', 'attorney', 'Jackson', 'trial', 'swirling', 'tempest', 'local', 'hatreds', 'be', 'aired.Director', 'Joel', 'Schumacher', 'certainly', 'surprised', 'good', 'work', 'being', 'man', 'who', 'made', 'quot', 'Batman', 'amp', 'Robin', 'quot', 'assemble', 'serious', 'acting', 'talent-', 'Samuel', 'L.', 'Jackson', 'Kevin', 'Spacey', 'DA', 'are', 'recognized', 'actors', 'Spacey', 'having', 'won', 'Oscar', 'quot', 'Usual', 'Suspects', 'quot', 'Jackson', '*long*', 'overdue', 'getting', 'one', 'big', 'surprise', 'was', 'Matthew', 'McConaughey', 'sterling', 'performance', 'idealistic', 'passionate', 'attorney', 'who', 'Jackson', 'McConaughey', 'terrific', 'actor-', 'laid', 'back', 'easy-going', 'just', 'enough', 'passion', 'intensity', 'movie', 'put', 'map', 'easy', 'see', 'why', 'talent', 'demand', 'Sandra', 'Bullock', 'Ashley', 'Judd', 'have', 'roles', 'here', 'do', ""n't"", 'make', 'much', 'impression', 'Donald', 'Sutherland', 'Keifer', 'have', 'parts', 'too-', 'former', 'Matthew', 'McConaughey', 'mentor', 'role', 'quite', 'good', 'incidentally', 'latter', 'local', 'redneck.Finally', 'word', 'plot', 'best', 'movies', 'give', 'sticky', 'problem', 'ca', ""n't"", 'be', 'resolved', 'easily', 'tricky', 'choice', 'quot', 'Crimson', 'Tide', 'quot', 'beautiful', 'example', 'decision', 'could', 'go', 'way', 'audience', 'something', 'debate', 'afterwards', 'Here', ""'re"", 'given', 'tricky', 'choice-', 'vengeance', 'justice', 'Do', 'acquit', 'Samuel', 'L.', 'Jackson', 'hearts', 'did', 'what', 'would', 'do', 'place', 'do', 'punish', 'taking', 'law', 'own', 'hands', 'rough', 'choice', 'make', 'movie', 'give', 'easy', 'answer.Well', 'done']",N/A

91838,A1D1MIFRSG50Y3,0790729660,Mike S.,"[0, 0]","There are a couple things to keep in mind about this movie.  One it was only a story.  It is clear that it was meant to combine elements of the southern justice system of the civil rights era (and before), both sanctioned and unsanctioned and make a more modern day story from it.  Anyone who knows history is aware of the fact that there was jury nullification many times in the south in favor of whites who had murdered blacks (and who had done so for far less compelling reasons than for which Samuel L. Jackson's character commits murder in this story).  What is ultimately done in this story is jury nullification going the other way, after leading you to think that it could not possibly happen.Secondly, given the fact that it is a courtroom drama, the legal aspect of it is almost completely wrong.  Anyone who has sat through a real trial knows that the vast majority of the time nothing dramatic happens.  Lawyers are not allowed to ask 5 min long questions to a witness, and then present another 5 min long soliloquy after the witness answers the question.  For the most part trials are usually very dry and boring, with little to no excitement or things like breaking the witness.  So pretty much every courtroom drama ever made has little to no authenticity to any of the legal aspects and this is no different.If you can get past all that however and just focus on the acting and suspend your disbelief, the rest of it is very good.  The suspension of disbelief will be hard for lawyers and especially law students.  I remember when I watched this while in law school I was basically counting everything it got wrong.  But now I can watch it without focusing on all that stuff.  I think Samuel L. Jackson and Matthew Matthew McConaughey played off each other very well.  Sandra Bullock and McConaughey sold the tension between their characters well, and Donald Sutherland did a great job as the old, washed up, alcoholic attorney who was advising the young upstart.  I also thought Kevin Spacy played the slimy district attorney very well.If you cannot get past how unreal the story is, then do not get the movie because you probably will not like it.  If you are good at suspension of disbelief and can just enjoy the story and good acting, then give it a try.",4,"A well acted, but completely preposterious story",1359158400,"01 26, 2013",2013,2275,"['are', 'couple', 'things', 'keep', 'mind', 'movie', 'One', 'was', 'only', 'story', 'clear', 'was', 'meant', 'combine', 'elements', 'southern', 'justice', 'system', 'civil', 'rights', 'era', 'sanctioned', 'unsanctioned', 'make', 'more', 'modern', 'day', 'story', 'Anyone', 'who', 'history', 'aware', 'fact', 'was', 'jury', 'nullification', 'many', 'times', 'south', 'favor', 'whites', 'who', 'had', 'murdered', 'blacks', 'who', 'had', 'done', 'so', 'far', 'less', 'compelling', 'reasons', 'Samuel', 'L.', 'Jackson', 'character', 'commits', 'murder', 'story', 'What', 'ultimately', 'done', 'story', 'jury', 'nullification', 'going', 'other', 'way', 'leading', 'think', 'could', 'not', 'possibly', 'happen.Secondly', 'given', 'fact', 'courtroom', 'drama', 'legal', 'aspect', 'almost', 'completely', 'wrong', 'Anyone', 'who', 'sat', 'real', 'trial', 'vast', 'majority', 'time', 'nothing', 'dramatic', 'happens', 'Lawyers', 'are', 'not', 'allowed', 'ask', '5', 'min', 'long', 'questions', 'witness', 'then', 'present', '5', 'min', 'long', 'soliloquy', 'witness', 'question', 'most', 'part', 'trials', 'are', 'usually', 'very', 'dry', 'boring', 'little', 'excitement', 'things', 'breaking', 'witness', 'So', 'pretty', 'much', 'courtroom', 'drama', 'ever', 'made', 'little', 'authenticity', 'legal', 'aspects', 'different.If', 'can', 'get', 'however', 'just', 'focus', 'acting', 'suspend', 'disbelief', 'rest', 'very', 'good', 'suspension', 'disbelief', 'will', 'be', 'hard', 'lawyers', 'especially', 'law', 'students', 'remember', 'when', 'watched', 'while', 'law', 'school', 'was', 'basically', 'counting', 'everything', 'got', 'wrong', 'now', 'can', 'watch', 'focusing', 'stuff', 'think', 'Samuel', 'L.', 'Jackson', 'Matthew', 'Matthew', 'McConaughey', 'played', 'off', 'other', 'very', 'well', 'Sandra', 'Bullock', 'McConaughey', 'sold', 'tension', 'characters', 'well', 'Donald', 'Sutherland', 'did', 'great', 'job', 'old', 'washed', 'up', 'alcoholic', 'attorney', 'who', 'was', 'advising', 'young', 'upstart', 'also', 'thought', 'Kevin', 'Spacy', 'played', 'slimy', 'district', 'attorney', 'very', 'can', 'not', 'get', 'how', 'unreal', 'story', 'then', 'do', 'not', 'get', 'movie', 'probably', 'will', 'not', 'like', 'are', 'good', 'suspension', 'disbelief', 'can', 'just', 'enjoy', 'story', 'good', 'acting', 'then', 'give', 'try']",N/A

Sandra Bullock was seriously miscast. She is probably the weakest of the roles in the movie and I found her distracting in nearly every scene. Ashely Judd starts out very strong, and it is a shame her character disappears too early in the movie while we have to put up with Bullock. The movie has too many clich&eacute;s and pushes some stereotypes unnecessarily, but we have to remember this movie is now 15 years old. It probably played better for its time. The fully automatic M16 troubled me. It is inconsistent with the role of the character. Possessing it legally is quite expensive and it is hard to visualize why he would possesses it illegally? Also, would a single high velocity M16 round take off a leg? Just don't think so. A pump shotgun would have been more believable. Except for Bullock, character development is good or adequate. However, I think the movie would have been much stronger if it focused more McConaughey's and Jackson's families. It sort started like this, but the movie lost its way with Bullocks character. To some degree, there were just too many stars besides McConaughey and Jackson who needed too much screen time. However, despite my criticisms, I do recommend this movie.

I read through - as I often do - the reviews before I decided to spend my own money to rent of buy a particular movie. Normally when I read a lot of bad reviews I just go away - I don't bother to write anything. But this time I thought I'd give my reasons. I apologize if you think I am abusing this service. I write a lot of reviews of products, books  and movies. I tend to buy everything I can from Amazon and I value the opinions of Amazon customers.As I read the comments it occurred to me that no one was remarking on the fact that the central premise of this movie is a fantasy. Whites simply don't rape blacks. The only famous case of white men raping a black girl was the Tawana Brawley case that made Al Sharpton a media star. It was of course a hoax. There seem to be tens of thousands of cases of black men raping white women but no cases of white men raping black girls or women. If there are any such cases they are very, very rare.Then I read that the KKK is a major plot point. But the KKK is hardly relevant today. A hundred years ago it might have been. It was once an above ground racial hate group with political influence - sort of like the New Black Panthers are today.  Having KKK clansmen in a modern setting is a highly discordant element.

91855,A3V61K0EF38GP4,0790729660,Philip Scholz,"[0, 0]","John Grisham, the author of the novel that this film was adapted from, has said that, of all the movie adaptions of his books (seriously, more than one...he's doing well), this one is his favorite.  As an avid John Grisham reader, I have to agree.  For one thing, it stays pretty faithful to it's source material, which is generally a good thing for me as adaptions rarely come off well when they deviate too greatly.  Matthew McConaughey and Kevin Spacey were two great advisaries on opposite sides of the courtroom during this high-profile murder trial...one fighting for his client, Samuel L. Jackson, who killed the men who had raped his daughter and now faces the Mississippi gas chamber for it, and the other seeks to further his political career.  I would like to compliment the cast on the fact that, while their characters certainly had southern accents, something vital given the plot takes place entirely in Mississippi, no one overdid it on that front, an instant mood-killer for me.  It was amusing to watch Sandra Bullock's character, a visitor from Massachusetts, try to fit in by pointing out things she knew about southern dialects and accents (like her first meeting with Mr. McConaughey.)  Also, correct me if I'm wrong (I hope I'm not) but I don't think Mr. McConaughey was even once shirtless in this film...proves he can be a good actor while remaining dressed.  I would have liked to have seen more of Ashley Judd, who played Mr. McConaughey's wife, but seeing as I've praised this film for it's faithfulness to the original novel and her character isn't in the novel that much because she's left town for her own and their daughter's well-being, I suppose I'll just deal with it.  I really liked Charles S. Dutton as the sherriff of the Mississippi town where all this mayhem takes place...the man can do no wrong.  I know that this film has sparked some contraversy for it's handling of murder and the punishments for it, but I've set all that aside and just enjoyed the film as a form of entertainment.  Donald Sutherland's character does some the situation up nicely when he points out that there will be justice whether the case is won or lost...that's one heck of a system right there.

Some have been made into excellent films (The Client, The Firm), and I was curious as to why they waited so long to film his first novel, A Time to Kill. Maybe it was that they were waiting to find the right guy to play the lead; they hit gold when Matthew McConaughey was cast, a most auspicious debut. The assembled cast is a profound collection of the best of the best. All are fine; but it's McConaughey who commands. It's a pity that this film received no Oscar recognition. Clear, crisp photography, great sets and brilliant editing, as well as many exeptional performances, simply are another example of Academy ignorance. Suspense films rarely get this personal and compelling. The combination of director Joel Schumacher & writer Akiva Goldsman hits a high mark on all scales.

91867,A1TK6R2JSC97HL,0790729660,Rottenberg's rotten book review,"[13, 27]","An enraged father takes the law into his own hands when two thugs brutalize his daughter. Quickly arrested, the two thugs and their guard are cut down by the raging patriarch. A clear case of parental rage you might say, but this is Hollywood - the father is black, the thugs are drunken rednecks with beer bellies and accents to match, and the resulting murder occurs in the sort of small, backwater southern town visited in countless episodes of ""Quantum Leap"" - so the real issue must be race. Now imprisoned, dad Carl Lee (Samuel L. Jackson) turns to a young white lawyer, Jake Tyler Brigance (Matt Mccaugnahey) for help. (Brigance is familiar in the town's black community, but Lee prime motivation is his utter whiteness - ""you're one of them"" the all-but condemned father declares near the end of the film). With his small firm, Brigance prepares what should be a winning defense (the act itself is pretty much indisputable, but legal insanity at a time under Lee's stress of learning of his daughter's victimization is inexplicably depicted as an impossible goal). On his side, Brigance has Lucien Wilbanks (Donald Sutherland), a once prominent liberal lawyer now disbarred but still sage; Harry Rex Vonner (Oliver Platt) as Brigance's associate, who is meant to be acceptably oily as well as playing the devil's advocate role played by Kevin Pollack in the far superior ""A Few Good Men""; rounding out the team is Ellen Roark, (Sandra Bullock) a rich law student who descends out of town offering Brigance free legal advice and boundless reserve, money and temptation. Against him is an utterly sleezy prosecutor (Kevin Spacey), a jury that has already decided the case, a resurgent cadre of KKK and a judge who isn't so much prejudicial as he is ominous because he's played by Patrick Mcgoohan and has the last name ""Noose"". (I guess ""Judge Syringe"" would have been too obvious).This movie is utterly shameless. Some might just call it PC, but ""A Time"" is bad because it is compulsively superior, taking not racial injustice as its impetus, but instead relying on pure self-righteousness. Brigance and Lee stand alone among self-serving opportunists, and not all of whom are on the prosecution's side (witness a band of aging civil-rights activists descending on the town with the hope of rekindling their cause with Lee's almost certain martyrdom). The script takes no chances at objectivity with Brigance's actual enemies. Spacey's prosecutor is utterly amoral - his strategy rests largely on a choice of trial venue guaranteed to create a jury whiter than soap, while using a technicality to discredit one of Brigance's witnesses; outside of court, Spacey's other big scene has him tossing out suggestive come-ons to Sandra Bullock (just so she can put him down, and good). Kiefer Southerland is utterly one-dimensional as the brother of one of Lee's victims, who brings the Klan back to their small town. Everything about the film is contrived, especially the issue of race. Are wupposed to think that Lee would have acted differently were he and his daughter's attackers of the same color?  It's a nonsensical prospect, but the script cravenly brings the KKK into the picture so that they and not the film's heroes can make the critical decision - if a bunch of torch-carrying redneck rubes in sheets thinks that this is a racial matter, who are we to dispute, right? Certainly, no white scriptwriters would have the bravery to set a polemic on racial injustice in Boston or south-central LA. What's worse is how a script that laments the suffering of the innocent actually discards characters like beer cans - Lee's daughter is practically a non-presence, Brigance's legal allies remain limited to discrete legal roles, even the poor court officer who gets cut down by accident during Lee's strike of vengeance - none rise from the background once the script has used them once. It's no surprise that this shallow film comes with a shallow end - with their town in ashes, after the deaths and the protests, and Lee's daughter (now invisible to the script) essentially scarred for life - the heroes gather at what looks to be a cookout. Films like ""Independence Day"" are escapist fun - this flick crossed the line into sci-fi.",1,A worthy subject brought down by a shameless script,1013472000,"02 12, 2002",2002,4240,"['enraged', 'father', 'law', 'own', 'hands', 'when', 'two', 'thugs', 'brutalize', 'daughter', 'Quickly', 'arrested', 'two', 'thugs', 'guard', 'are', 'cut', 'down', 'raging', 'patriarch', 'clear', 'case', 'parental', 'rage', 'might', 'say', 'Hollywood', 'father', 'black', 'thugs', 'are', 'drunken', 'rednecks', 'beer', 'bellies', 'accents', 'match', 'resulting', 'murder', 'occurs', 'sort', 'small', 'backwater', 'southern', 'town', 'visited', 'countless', 'episodes', 'Quantum', 'Leap', 'real', 'issue', 'must', 'be', 'race', 'Now', 'imprisoned', 'dad', 'Carl', 'Lee', 'Samuel', 'L.', 'Jackson', 'young', 'white', 'lawyer', 'Jake', 'Tyler', 'Brigance', 'Matt', 'Mccaugnahey', 'help', 'Brigance', 'familiar', 'town', 'black', 'community', 'Lee', 'prime', 'motivation', 'utter', 'whiteness', ""'re"", 'one', 'all-but', 'condemned', 'father', 'declares', 'end', 'film', 'small', 'firm', 'Brigance', 'what', 'should', 'be', 'winning', 'defense', 'act', 'pretty', 'much', 'indisputable', 'legal', 'insanity', 'time', 'Lee', 'stress', 'learning', 'daughter', 'victimization', 'inexplicably', 'depicted', 'impossible', 'goal', 'side', 'Brigance', 'Lucien', 'Wilbanks', 'Donald', 'Sutherland', 'once', 'prominent', 'liberal', 'lawyer', 'now', 'disbarred', 'still', 'sage', 'Harry', 'Rex', 'Vonner', 'Oliver', 'Platt', 'Brigance', 'associate', 'who', 'meant', 'be', 'acceptably', 'oily', 'as', 'well', 'playing', 'devil', 'advocate', 'role', 'played', 'Kevin', 'Pollack', 'far', 'superior', 'A', 'Few', 'Good', 'Men', 'rounding', 'out', 'team', 'Ellen', 'Roark', 'Sandra', 'Bullock', 'rich', 'law', 'student', 'who', 'town', 'offering', 'Brigance', 'free', 'legal', 'advice', 'boundless', 'reserve', 'money', 'temptation', 'Against', 'utterly', 'sleezy', 'prosecutor', 'Kevin', 'Spacey', 'jury', 'already', 'decided', 'case', 'resurgent', 'cadre', 'KKK', 'judge', 'who', ""n't"", 'so', 'much', 'prejudicial', 'ominous', 'played', 'Patrick', 'Mcgoohan', 'last', 'name', 'Noose', 'guess', 'Judge', 'Syringe', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'too', 'obvious', '.This', 'movie', 'utterly', 'shameless', 'might', 'just', 'call', 'PC', 'Time', 'bad', 'compulsively', 'superior', 'taking', 'not', 'racial', 'injustice', 'impetus', 'instead', 'relying', 'pure', 'self-righteousness', 'Brigance', 'Lee', 'stand', 'alone', 'self-serving', 'opportunists', 'not', 'whom', 'are', 'prosecution', 'side', 'band', 'aging', 'civil-rights', 'activists', 'descending', 'town', 'hope', 'rekindling', 'cause', 'Lee', 'almost', 'certain', 'martyrdom', 'script', 'chances', 'objectivity', 'Brigance', 'actual', 'enemies', 'Spacey', 'prosecutor', 'utterly', 'amoral', 'strategy', 'largely', 'choice', 'trial', 'venue', 'guaranteed', 'create', 'jury', 'whiter', 'soap', 'using', 'technicality', 'discredit', 'one', 'Brigance', 'witnesses', 'court', 'Spacey', 'other', 'big', 'scene', 'tossing', 'out', 'suggestive', 'come-ons', 'Sandra', 'Bullock', 'just', 'so', 'can', 'put', 'down', 'good', 'Kiefer', 'Southerland', 'utterly', 'one-dimensional', 'brother', 'one', 'Lee', 'victims', 'who', 'Klan', 'back', 'small', 'town', 'Everything', 'film', 'contrived', 'especially', 'issue', 'race', 'Are', 'wupposed', 'think', 'Lee', 'would', 'have', 'acted', 'differently', 'were', 'daughter', 'attackers', 'same', 'color', 'nonsensical', 'prospect', 'script', 'cravenly', 'KKK', 'picture', 'not', 'film', 'heroes', 'can', 'make', 'critical', 'decision', 'bunch', 'torch-carrying', 'redneck', 'rubes', 'sheets', 'thinks', 'racial', 'matter', 'who', 'are', 'dispute', 'right', 'Certainly', 'white', 'scriptwriters', 'would', 'have', 'bravery', 'set', 'polemic', 'racial', 'injustice', 'Boston', 'south-central', 'LA', 'What', 'worse', 'how', 'script', 'suffering', 'innocent', 'actually', 'characters', 'beer', 'cans', 'Lee', 'daughter', 'practically', 'non-presence', 'Brigance', 'legal', 'allies', 'remain', 'limited', 'discrete', 'legal', 'roles', 'even', 'poor', 'court', 'officer', 'who', 'cut', 'down', 'accident', 'Lee', 'strike', 'vengeance', 'none', 'rise', 'background', 'script', 'used', 'once', 'surprise', 'shallow', 'film', 'shallow', 'end', 'town', 'ashes', 'deaths', 'protests', 'Lee', 'daughter', 'now', 'script', 'essentially', 'scarred', 'life', 'heroes', 'gather', 'what', 'be', 'cookout', 'Films', 'Independence', 'Day', 'are', 'escapist', 'fun', 'flick', 'crossed', 'line', 'sci-fi']",N/A

When a black man kills the two white rednecks who brutally raped and beat his daughter it seems his conviction of the murders will be cut and dry.  So when the small town's lawyer is asked by the man (played with masterful skill by Samuel L. Jackson) to defend him it seems a hopeless cause.  But when the klan gets involved the case becomes personal.This film is entirely unsettling because it makes us realize that events like this still happen in small towns throughout America, especially in the South.  The themes of racism, of overcoming racism, of justifiable homicide, of justice outside the law are so superbly represented in this film that it seems impossible to me that this movie wasn't nominated for many Academy Awards.

91871,A13910TC3NZ6LE,0790729660,Sam Bethune,"[10, 12]","There's a phenomenon in the law known as &quot;jurynullification&quot;, which means that even though a person istechnically guilty of a crime, a jury will refuse to convict a defendant if it feels the motive was proper.  Basically, that's the premise of &quot;A Time to Kill&quot;, John Grisham's first and best novel.I note that one previous reviewer (the British gentleman who claims to have studied law) wrote a rather scathing review of the movie.  Apparently he feels that this sort of thing can't take place in an American courtroom.  Having been an attorney for some eight years now, I can tell you that it can and does!The big screen version, directed by Joel Schumacher, is right up there with Francis Ford Coppola's direction of &quot;The Rainmaker&quot; as the best and most faithful adaptation of a Grisham novel into a movie.If I have any problem with this movie, it's that Sondra Bullock (who's star was on the rise at the time this movie was being made) got top billing.  Anyone who's read the novel can tell you that her character is a rather minor one, and the major figure of this movie is Jake Brigance, portrayed with distinction by a relative unknown (at that time) by the name of Matthew McConaughey.  Ashley Judd turns in a fine performance as his wife, and Kevin Spacey is his usual excellent self as the DA.  Samuel L. Jackson was also well cast as the anguished father who avenged his daughter.Although there are some detractors who say that this movie glorifies vigilante justice, I would say that they're missing the point.  The point is that we as a society have gotten to the point where we will occasionally excuse a person from otherwise criminal conduct if we agree that his motive was pure.  The irony in it all is that those who committed crimes against blacks in the early days of the civil rights movement in the American South often escaped accountability by the very same means.",5,An Interesting Study of Jury Nullification,947462400,"01 10, 2000",2000,1917,"['phenomenon', 'law', 'known', 'quot', 'jurynullification', 'quot', 'even', 'person', 'istechnically', 'guilty', 'crime', 'jury', 'will', 'refuse', 'convict', 'defendant', 'motive', 'was', 'proper', 'Basically', 'premise', 'quot', 'Time', 'Kill', 'quot', 'John', 'Grisham', 'first', 'best', 'novel.I', 'note', 'one', 'previous', 'reviewer', 'British', 'gentleman', 'who', 'have', 'studied', 'law', 'wrote', 'rather', 'scathing', 'review', 'movie', 'Apparently', 'sort', 'thing', 'ca', ""n't"", 'take', 'place', 'American', 'courtroom', 'Having', 'been', 'attorney', 'eight', 'years', 'now', 'can', 'tell', 'can', 'big', 'screen', 'version', 'directed', 'Joel', 'Schumacher', 'right', 'there', 'Francis', 'Ford', 'Coppola', 'direction', 'quot', 'Rainmaker', 'quot', 'best', 'most', 'faithful', 'adaptation', 'Grisham', 'novel', 'movie.If', 'have', 'problem', 'movie', 'Sondra', 'Bullock', 'who', 'star', 'was', 'rise', 'time', 'movie', 'was', 'being', 'made', 'got', 'top', 'billing', 'Anyone', 'who', 'read', 'novel', 'can', 'tell', 'character', 'rather', 'minor', 'one', 'major', 'figure', 'movie', 'Jake', 'Brigance', 'portrayed', 'distinction', 'relative', 'unknown', 'time', 'name', 'Matthew', 'McConaughey', 'Ashley', 'Judd', 'fine', 'performance', 'wife', 'Kevin', 'Spacey', 'usual', 'excellent', 'self', 'DA', 'Samuel', 'L.', 'Jackson', 'was', 'also', 'well', 'cast', 'anguished', 'father', 'who', 'avenged', 'daughter.Although', 'are', 'detractors', 'who', 'say', 'movie', 'vigilante', 'justice', 'would', 'say', ""'re"", 'missing', 'point', 'point', 'society', 'have', 'gotten', 'point', 'where', 'will', 'occasionally', 'excuse', 'person', 'otherwise', 'criminal', 'conduct', 'agree', 'motive', 'was', 'pure', 'irony', 'who', 'committed', 'crimes', 'blacks', 'early', 'days', 'civil', 'rights', 'movement', 'American', 'South', 'often', 'escaped', 'accountability', 'very', 'same', 'means']",N/A

This movie took place in a time where the justice system was not on the side of MINORITY Americans, period. But let's put that all aside for a minute. This movie is about a PARENT. Parents KNOW their role is to protect and nurture their babies. And any parent with their child in the same situation, black, white, latino, asian, would probably temporarily go insane and seek revenge, especially in those times where racism was a huge part of life. And look at the nature of the CRIME that his little girl went through: Two grown behind men, drunk and nasty and violent at that, snatched his little girl. A GIRL. She was a baby!!! They violently beat her, they RAPED her, they took her ability to trust, to have children of her own, and thought they KILLED her after they bust her in her head, but she was strong....so strong......and she stayed alive. THEY knew what they were doing. Now, I don't even support the death penalty, but for any man, of ANY race might I add, do that to ANY child, again of ANY race, they are too sick to do the world any good.This movie was very upsetting, and I did think for a moment, what would I have done if that was MY baby. I would have went CRAZY and reacted the same way. Can't nobody try to ""talk sense"" into me when it comes to the safety of my children at the hands of another person. In addition, Carl was getting information that was pointing towards those two men walking FREE. THAT is why Carl Lee's character killed them before that could happen.I do agree that the whole line of ""imagine she was white"" was very ridiculous and not to mention irrelevant in my opinion. Samuel L. Jackson did not kill those two men because they were white. He killed them because they hurt his baby. HE did not see race when he pulled that trigger. The valid point that should have been made was ""imaging she was YOUR young daughter.""

91884,AL277B4AQCWBG,0790729660,Steven Reynolds,"[11, 31]","Am I missing something?  Please write and tell me if I am, because I can't understand why people admire this movie.  As far as I can tell, this is what happens in ""A Time To Kill"": Carl Lee's daughter is raped and left for dead, and her white tormentors are captured.  Before they face trial, Carl kills them.  Why?  They would not be convicted, because as we all know a white southern jury couldn't possibly set aside its racism.  Carl is then acquitted by a white southern jury that sets aside its racism.  The film urges us to celebrate this verdict as some kind of race-relations watershed.  But beneath the back-slapping, soaring music and soft focus, the take home message is this: ""There is a time to kill.  If you think the justice system won't give you justice, then revenge killing is a noble option.""  Not only is this one of most appallingly idiotic dictums ever conceived, it betrays an appreciation of the justice system which is, at best, infantile.Let's apply a little common sense here.  What the white rapists did was wrong, and they should be punished for it.  What the black father did was wrong, and he should be punished for it, too.  Cases closed.  Yes, we can empathize with Carl.  Yes, put in the same position we might even do the same thing ourselves.  No, that doesn't make it right.  Even if you think Carl was rightly acquitted, the film defeats its own argument: the fact that Jake Brigance gets a white jury to recognise and set aside its inherent racism (""now imagine she's white"") demonstrates that Carl's fears were unjustified.  There was no need to take the law into his own hands after all - a black man can get justice from a white court.  However, I think a more realistic interpretation of the outcome is that a dumb jury can be sweet-talked by a pretty-boy lawyer into acquitting a guilty man they feel sorry for.  And what kind of 'justice' is that?  Don't ask screenwriter Akiva Goldsman - this is just another one of his sci-fi scripts.  Nor director Joel Schumacher - here, as in his equally insulting ""Batman"" films, he seems more interested in visually molesting his male star than in telling a decent story, and clearly spent most of his time contriving ways to get Matthew McConaughey's shirt off or setting up lingering butt shots.This film was pitched as an exciting suspense-thriller, nicely cast with a mix of heavy-weights and newcomers, and having the guts to explore some serious social and moral issues. For me, it's a vile and contemptible little film peddling an equally repulsive morality.  What the hell Spacey, Bullock and the Sutherlands are doing here is beyond me.  It's a blot on all their resumes.  Go back to your old job as a window dresser, Joel.

Two rednecks rape and beat the 10 year old daughter of Samuel L. Jackson, who fears they might get off. In open and broad daylight Jackson guns down the rapists. He is on trial for murder. Matthew McConaughey plays a sympathetic attorney who leads a rag-tag group (including Bullock and Donald Sutherland) to defend Jackson against the prosecuting attorney, Kevin Spacey (with a southern accent) who wants to make a name for himself in his bid for governor. The NAACP attempts to take over the case while an overly represented KKK terrorizes the town. Criticism: The temporary insanity plea is clearly a plea for jury nullification, although the movie never uses that phrase.

91891,A1ISW6NMR45Y71,0790729660,Tome Raider,"[5, 10]","I had high hopes for this film based on some of the major talent which is in it.  This was obviously a huge production and there is no lacking of ""big names"". But this ill-fated project obviously had Mystic River aspirations while only having Cagney and Lacey story-line horsepower.In fact, I'm incredulous that all these people agreed to be in this because I presume the hollowness of the story was apparent from even a brief scanning of the script.Soon into the film I realized it was lacking in any nuance or new insights.  From 30 minutes in I could have written the balance of the script.  Beyond predictable, it is painfully cliche and bloated in every way imaginable.The hillbilly rapists are totally despicable and repulsive, with no redeeming or mitigating qualities at all.  Wouldn't the story have been better served by some tension as to whether these monsters deserved to die? Here there was no question at all.Matthew Mc. is a stuggling idealist attorney who is in financial trouble, and who has a sassy but dedicated older secretary who is trying to keep the office financially afloat; taking on a new case of this nature doesn't help the cash flow situation at all, and hardships ensue....didn't we see exactly that scenario in ""Anatomy of a Murder"" fifty years ago? He has some dandy of a friend who wears striped suits whose role is unclear throughout.All the courtroom machinations are as predictable as gravity, and unrealistic to the core: The grumpy judge of questionable ethics and motivations. The politically motivated DA.  The last minute arrival of important evidence and the unfair surprise attack on defense witnesses. These characters and events are all tired cliche.  Yawn.The Donald Sutherland ""role model"" character seems to again come from ""Anatomy of Murder"" where an old alcoholic lawyer guided a younger attorney with his words of wisdom and various anecdotes.  Here the Sutherland character adds nothing.  The Sanda Bullock ""true believer"" character adds little as well.  Matthew's wife is totally righteous and beautiful, and any sexual tension between Matthew and Bullock is unfortunate, not appealing.The racial commentary here is unfortunately banal and unconstructive.  Matthew was more hip to the plight of the father-defendant than his client gave him credit for being.  In fact, given the circumstances of the attack on the girl, almost any jury would applaud the father for killing the perpetrators rather than convicting him for that action. This defendant, at a minimum, would have a ""heat of passion"" defense, which would drop him down to two counts of mere manslaughter.  He also would have an insanity option.  But the biggest obstacle to the prosecutor would be the fact that what this man did, as the father of a young girl who was brutally gang raped, was quite simply overwhelmingly understandable. People would empathize with his actions. Most fathers would do the same thing, if they possibly could.  To suggest otherwise was bogus, even in Mississippi.  The accidental shooting of the sheriff, during the revenge killings, was far more interesting in terms of reasonable outcome.  Even with that man's forgiveness, the revenge should have been served without collateral damage to innocent people.  The appropriate verdict as to the shooting of the deputy was by far the most interesting legal and moral question in this movie, in my view, and I did like the way they handled it.Most painful of all was Matthew's closing argument (alert: paraphrased spoiler):  ""....Then, ask yourself what if she was WHITE!""  Wow, is that a unique approach!  I'd never thought of that distinction before! That really drives the point home! He got me there, great question, very transcendent and metaphysical!  By golly I'd never thought of it that way, this guy is good!--is that what the jurors were supposed to think?  I think jurors would have already asked themselves that--like two minutes into the trial.  The dynamics of the rape and the revenge shootings were pretty obvious, and I don't think this pithy little inquiry added any new insight at all.  I can't recall a movie where the ""denouement"" is so shockingly anticlimactic.  Overall: the entire culmination is unbelievably weak, given what must have been a vast budget for this film.  I would have chipped off Donald Sutherland or Bullock and used the money for a real writer.Then, Matthew and family are cool enough that they go over to black family's house for a BBQ after all the dust has settled.  Darned decent of them, very open!  A new era in race relations for sure! Painful, trite, insipid. The movie made it seem as if this were an open and grand gesture when it seemed virtually inevitable to me; the two families at this point are now forever bonded by blood for all intents and purposes, aren't they?? I'd presume they'd be lunching together twice a week and bowling on Thursdays for the next twenty years after what they went through together.This movie is a glaring blemish in the careers of all involved. It just resonates way too shallow and offers no realistic or new insight into the types of issues it portrays. One exception, perhaps, would be Keifer Sutherland, who I thought displayed a very convincing manic hatred which you would imagine coming from a KKK lunatic.  I give one star for him alone.This movie, overall, is on the same literary level as the statement authored by one Rodney King almost two decades ago:  ""Can't we all just get along?""  Good question, important point.  I thought Rodney's simple question was more to the point and more authentic than this pompous, preachy, politically correct 2.5 hours of budget-bloated bombast.",2,Budget-Bloated

Under the brilliant direction of Joel Schumacher and based on the best-selling novel by John Grisham, A TIME TO KILL digs hard and deep into some of the most sensitive and controversial issues of our time.After his 10-year-old daughter is raped and beaten by two local rednecks, Carl Lee Hailey (Samuel L. Jackson) guns down the guilty men on their way to court. Matthew McConaughey comes to the rescue as the white, Southern attorney who defends him. With the help of a young, ambitious, brilliant law student (played by Sandra Bullock, who surprisingly received top billing for her small, but memorable role), a close friend and colleague (the always comical and entertaining Oliver Platt), and his disbarred mentor and teacher (the classic Donald Sutherland), McConaughey stirs up a lot of hatred and puts everything on the line to defend a black man. The film addresses racism, the Klan, vigilante justice and all the issues we commonly associate with ""the south.""Another perfect role for McConaughey. He charms and captivates the audience as well as the jury. He's not too tough to look at for 3+ hours, too! Samuel L. Jackson . . . what can I say . . . one of the greatest actors in our time, he seems to effortlessly convert himself to any role he takes on. Sandra Bullock shines on screen, as always, with her lovable and down-to-earth personality. I don't see Oliver Platt enough, but when I do, I'm always pleased with his ""fun"" performance.In this 1996 film, other supporting actors are also perfectly cast. In an earlier role, Ashley Judd plays McConaughey's wife. Keifer Sutherland plays a local redneck, brother to one of the rapists and Kevin Spacey is the local DA who prosecutes Carl Lee. You may also recognize two stars of TV's BOSTON PUBLIC, Nicky Katt and Anthony Heald. Excellent southern accents by all (Platt, Spacey, both Sutherlands). However, McConaughey's own Texan accent needed no alteration here.Not having read the book, I'm not making a movie/book comparison here. Just a truly great movie with superb actors by the fist-full.

Two racist criminals rape and traumatize a young girl, and the father (Carl Lee Hailey, played by Samuel L. Jackson) takes the law into his own hands by killing them pre-trial.  The bulk of the story revolves around the defense of the father in court by a small-town lawyer (Jake Brigance, played by Matthew McConaughey).  The cast chosen was superb - Jackson, McConaughey, Sandra Bullock, the Sutherlands, Oliver Platt, Kevin Spacey, Ashley Judd, Charles S.

This is a movie that not only provides a good drama, but also raises questions about some of the basic underpinnings of our system and society as a whole.  I don't believe there are many people who can watch this movie (or read the book) and not walk away from it without facing their own core beliefs about these issues... making a good drama that also forces the viewer to think about any issues raised in the film is not an easy task, but Joel Schumacher manages to do both that and represent Grisham's novel well.
