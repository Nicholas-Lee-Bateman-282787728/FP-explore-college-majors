1266229,A3AHDR4F2J7YXX,B002FG9NC8,"Caliaha ""Caliaha""","[80, 80]","I bought this DVD as it looked like a quite interesting low-impact workout for baby boomers. I was presently surprised because it was quite challenging and different than any other workout DVD that I have. It has helped me with sciatica pain and general overall toning.The workouts are a great combination of muscle building (without weights), cardio, and stretching. It would be good for people who want to get started with an in-home workout program or, like me, just to add interest to your current program.There are 3 segments that you can do independently one 20-minute upper body, 20-minute one lower body, and one 15-minute abs workout. You will get a complete full body workout if you do all 3 or light workout individually.I was surprised, I sweated pretty good during the workout even though there's not a lot of jumping around. You can make it however difficult you want as Joel's older mother and friend provide beginner and intermidiate level, while Joel provides options of higher-level advanced versions of the exercises. In the workout segments, Joel leads the instruction OF high-reps with body movements and stretching in between which I really like on low-impact workout days.Wow, Amazon has a great price for $8.49, I wished I bought it here instead of Border's for full price. It's a great buy, highly-recommended for any age group!!!",5,A new way of working out for everyone.,1263513600,"01 15, 2010",2010,1355,"['bought', 'DVD', 'looked', 'quite', 'interesting', 'low-impact', 'workout', 'baby', 'boomers', 'was', 'presently', 'surprised', 'was', 'quite', 'challenging', 'different', 'other', 'workout', 'DVD', 'have', 'helped', 'sciatica', 'pain', 'general', 'overall', 'toning.The', 'workouts', 'are', 'great', 'combination', 'muscle', 'building', 'weights', 'cardio', 'stretching', 'would', 'be', 'good', 'people', 'who', 'want', 'get', 'started', 'in-home', 'workout', 'program', 'just', 'add', 'interest', 'current', 'are', '3', 'segments', 'can', 'do', 'independently', 'one', '20-minute', 'upper', 'body', '20-minute', 'one', 'lower', 'body', 'one', '15-minute', 'abs', 'workout', 'will', 'get', 'complete', 'full', 'body', 'do', '3', 'light', 'workout', 'individually.I', 'was', 'surprised', 'sweated', 'pretty', 'good', 'workout', 'even', 'not', 'lot', 'jumping', 'around', 'can', 'make', 'however', 'difficult', 'want', 'Joel', 'older', 'mother', 'friend', 'provide', 'beginner', 'intermidiate', 'level', 'Joel', 'options', 'higher-level', 'advanced', 'versions', 'exercises', 'workout', 'segments', 'Joel', 'instruction', 'high-reps', 'body', 'movements', 'stretching', 'really', 'low-impact', 'workout', 'days.Wow', 'Amazon', 'great', 'price', '8.49', 'wished', 'bought', 'here', 'instead', 'Border', 'full', 'price', 'great', 'buy', 'highly-recommended', 'age', 'group']",N/A

Joel goes at an easy pace but our heart rates accelerated  as we did some advanced moves.  We discovered our balance could use some work and will continue to work on improvement in that area.  The helpers are VERY good with the demonstrations as well, particularly in the ABS section.

One of the main common threads running through each of SR's extraordinary chapter/story, I noticed especially, was the importance of exercise and fitness as a prerequisite to great lovemaking. Needless to say, that got my attention.Which leads me to number two: I discovered several great exercise DVDs and books specifically for seniors, including this Joel Harper's Firming After 50. It's obviously for seniors, but what I liked is that it takes you from beginning to more advanced.More than ever, I've become such a cheerleader for seniors to (1) get back in the romance game and (2) focus on fitness.Thanks, Joel Harper and Dr. Oz, for the great work you are doing for seniors like me!",5,Romantic Benefits of Firming After 50,1312243200,"08 2, 2011",2011,962,"['Two', 'great', 'things', 'happened', 'past', 'year.First', 'discovered', 'books', 'Seasoned', 'Romance', 'Dr.', 'Ruth', 'Sex', '50', 'Grandpa', 'Does', 'Grandma', 'helped', 'realize', 'larger', 'extent', 'ever', 'seniors', 'could', 'still', 'be', 'excited', 'sex', 'romance', 'One', 'main', 'common', 'threads', 'running', 'SR', 'extraordinary', 'chapter/story', 'noticed', 'especially', 'was', 'importance', 'exercise', 'fitness', 'prerequisite', 'great', 'lovemaking', 'Needless', 'say', 'got', 'attention.Which', 'number', 'two', 'discovered', 'several', 'great', 'exercise', 'DVDs', 'books', 'specifically', 'seniors', 'including', 'Joel', 'Harper', 'Firming', '50', 'obviously', 'seniors', 'what', 'liked', 'beginning', 'more', 'advanced.More', 'ever', ""'ve"", 'become', 'cheerleader', 'seniors', '1', 'get', 'back', 'romance', 'game', '2', 'focus', 'fitness.Thanks', 'Joel', 'Harper', 'Dr.', 'Oz', 'great', 'work', 'are', 'doing', 'seniors']",N/A

In all three workouts, the movements, exercises, and stretches are intermixed.  The movements and exercises wake up and invigorate your body, while the stretches restore flexibility and are sometimes relaxing and gentle.The purpose of these workouts seems to be geared toward maintaining muscle and bone integrity, and restoring mobility and flexibility, and just being fit overall.Upper body workout is about 24 minutes.  All work is done standing.Lower body workout is about 18 and half minutes.  All work is done standing.  There is balance work and there are some isometrics.Ab workout is about 15 minutes, 22 seconds.  All work is done on the floor.
