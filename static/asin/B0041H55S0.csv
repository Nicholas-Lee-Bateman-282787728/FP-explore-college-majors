The humor here makes the grim aspects of the tale far more bearable. Plus, Tyler is hilarious in his ad-libs as he clearly works his rapport with the live audience for full effect. The scene involving the takeoffs on soul singers may seem out of joint to some viewers as it is not really related to the stopry at all, but works well with the live audience response.

I liked the beginning. made me feel we talking about the recession here, but we get drawn into a nice church lady(Chandra Currelley) who is only given a few weeks to live after trying her level best to beat cancer. With that in mind, she tries to gather her children together along with her doctor to let her know what's going on. You have one daughter Jackie(Cheryl Pepsi Riley) who is a plain jane Christian who does what she can for her mother; You also have another daughter with a mechanic husband, who stifles him so that he can't be the man he needs to be, then you have another successful daughter(Tamar Davis)who also stifles her husband, but is carrying around a secret that rocks the family; on the son's side, you have one son, already been in jail, with one baby momma, and one golddigger who wants her money by ""all means necessary"" even if he has go back to slinging; then another son, who is slow, but got heart. Add to the pot, a brother on crack who will steal anything not locked down, and you got a good play here. Also added to the pot, one wisecracking, crazy, bible toting, weed smoking aunt(Cassi Davis) and you got the makings of a good play.
