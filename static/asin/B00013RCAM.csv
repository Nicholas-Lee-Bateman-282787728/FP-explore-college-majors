It might take awhile for the average modern viewer to get into it, though, since there really isn't much of a plot, not the way we've come to expect in modern movies, just a narration of various adventures the family had.  This is by far one of the best and most honest screen adaptations of a book I've yet seen, right up there with 'Gone with the Wind' and 'Fiddler on the Roof.'  However, screen adaptations of books being what they have to be due to time and money constraints, they naturally couldn't fit everything in, and so had to cut and paste some events from the book together so they wouldn't completely overlook the important stuff (and unlike many cut and paste jobs in other book-based movies, here it was done very tastefully instead of randomly and carelessly), and they did leave out a number of the funniest stories in the book, like Bill pushing the Chinese cook into the oven and the so-called interviews which ran in the paper, much to the family's horror that a lot of the things they supposedly said and did were made up to embarrass them.  They also got the birth order of the last two mixed up; Jane was the last-born child in real life, and Bob was the penultimate.  Still, given what passes for entertainment nowadays and how movies based on books usually bear little or no coherent resemblance to the story which the viewers know and love, this is a very clean and fun family movie.",4,Enjoyable movie true to the book's spirit,1103932800,"12 25, 2004",2004,1654,"['supposed', 'remake', 'put', 'out', 'end', '2003', 'original', 'movie', 'adaptation', 'book', 'actually', 'heart', 'entertaining', 'resorting', 'cheap', 'shots', 'gross-out', 'humour', 'overwhelmingly', 'true', 'spirit', 'book', 'might', 'take', 'awhile', 'average', 'modern', 'viewer', 'get', 'though', 'really', ""n't"", 'much', 'plot', 'not', 'way', ""'ve"", 'come', 'expect', 'modern', 'movies', 'just', 'narration', 'various', 'adventures', 'family', 'had', 'far', 'one', 'best', 'most', 'honest', 'screen', 'adaptations', 'book', ""'ve"", 'yet', 'seen', 'right', 'there', ""'Gone"", 'Wind', ""'Fiddler"", 'Roof', 'However', 'screen', 'adaptations', 'books', 'being', 'what', 'have', 'be', 'due', 'time', 'money', 'constraints', 'naturally', 'could', ""n't"", 'fit', 'everything', 'so', 'had', 'cut', 'paste', 'events', 'book', 'together', 'would', ""n't"", 'completely', 'overlook', 'important', 'stuff', 'many', 'cut', 'paste', 'jobs', 'other', 'book-based', 'movies', 'here', 'was', 'done', 'very', 'tastefully', 'instead', 'randomly', 'carelessly', 'did', 'leave', 'out', 'number', 'funniest', 'stories', 'book', 'Bill', 'pushing', 'Chinese', 'cook', 'oven', 'so-called', 'interviews', 'ran', 'paper', 'much', 'family', 'horror', 'lot', 'things', 'supposedly', 'said', 'did', 'were', 'made', 'up', 'embarrass', 'also', 'got', 'birth', 'order', 'last', 'two', 'mixed', 'up', 'Jane', 'was', 'last-born', 'child', 'real', 'life', 'Bob', 'was', 'penultimate', 'Still', 'given', 'what', 'entertainment', 'nowadays', 'how', 'movies', 'based', 'books', 'usually', 'bear', 'little', 'coherent', 'resemblance', 'story', 'viewers', 'know', 'love', 'very', 'clean', 'fun', 'family', 'movie']",N/A

792616,A3HMOQO8J0SOC3,B00013RCAM,"bix lang ""pastafagiole""","[8, 8]","""Cheaper by the Dozen"" is a tasteful and nostalgic classic film about the famous Gilbreath Family of industrial engineers who pioneered the field of time management. The setting is 1910-1920, when society and music were both more civil and tasteful. Just as in its equally classic cousin, ""Life With Father,"" timeless tunes like ""When You Wore A Tullip And I Wore A Big Red Rose,"" ""Sweet Genevieve"" and ""Just A Song At Twilight"" are highlighted. But most enjoyable is the acting of two Hollywood legends: the elegant and classy Myrna Loy and the vitriolic, pompous but loveable Clifton Webb. As the patriarch of the Gilbreath clan, Webb is his incomparably witty, acerbic self. Film fans should note that Hollywood tried to lure Webb back to Hollywood in the early talkie period (he had done some silents in the 1910s and 1920s) but he chose to remain the toast of the New York stage where he was America's greatest ballroom dancer twenty years before anyone ever heard of Fred Astaire. Webb returned to Hollywood in the early 1940s with his Academy Award nominated role of Waldo Lydecker in the classic ""Laura."" Webb was nominated again in his very next film for his superb portrayal of Elliot Templeton in ""The Razor's Edge."" His third talkie earned him a third consecutive Academy Award nomination-this time for Best Actor---in the hillarious comedy ""Sitting Pretty,"" which introduced Webb's timeless Mr. Belvadere character. Webb was an American treasure of stage, ballroom, and screen. Among other things, Webb made ballroom dancing (along with his equally talented partner, Bonnie Glass)the rage of the World War I era, was a operatic prodigy, introduced the white dinner jacket, and introduced classic Tin Pan Alley tunes like ""I'll Guess I'll Have To Change My Plan"" twenty years before Sinatra sang them. ""Cheaper By The Dozen"" serves as a great work of family entertainment that also illuminates an appreciable fraction of Webb's extraordinary talents.

It is touching, entertaining, funny, moving, etc.  This movie in 1950 captures that spirit.  The setting is the years before and after World War I.The father was strict, but he never took himself too seriously, and he dearly loved his wife and each of their children.  And they loved him.The movie is a series of some of the best vignettes in the book.  A lot of the anecdotes had to be left out, of course.  The book includes scenes from their courtship and from Gilbreth's earlier life.He was from a poor family and started out as a bricklayer's apprentice.  Laying bricks and watching what he was doing and how he was doing it led him to develop the principles of time-and-motion study.  Soon, he started his own bricklaying business; and by applying his principles, he could get a bricklaying job done three-times faster than his competitors.  Also, his methods were such that his workmen did not get as tired.  Also, as I recall, he gave them a five-minute break every hour.  Because he could complete three jobs in the time it took his competitors to complete one, he was able to afford to underbid his competitors and still make more profit.  He paid his workers higher wages than his competitors, hence he was able to hire the best workers, which further increased his competitive advantage.  With the money he made, he finally set himself up in business as an ""efficiency expert"", an unheard-of field at the time.There are also scenes of the courtship of these two who were from opposite sides of the track.  Her mother was opposed to the match, of course.  She didn't listen and was happy the rest of her life.In these times, when children are raised by daycare centers and TV sets, it is difficult to comprehend a family like the Gilbreths.  It was less difficult at the time this movie came out.  Not all families were as happy but many were.  The book and the movie are less about raising a family efficiently than about raising them well.  Mrs. Gilbreth was a psychologist and understood that.  Instead of dismissing this movie and the book as make-believe, people with children would do well to get the book and try to learn from it.Also, enjoy it.

It concerns the trial and tribulations of two efficiency experts/engineers who raise a brood of 12 kids in the 1920's. Narrated by actress Jeanne Crain who tells their story in retrospect and portrays the oldest daughter in the Gilbreath family, it is composed of charming and riotous vignettes that walk the family through the normal process of growing up in a large family. Particular focus is placed on the older daughters and their frustrating attempts to mature which are often thwarted unsuccessfully by their father Frank (Clifton Webb) while their mother Lillian (Myrna Loy) provides stability and a sane presence amidst the inevitable commotion.The script, which was based on a book by daughter Ernestine Gilbreath, is funny and fast paced. While the children share a lot of screen time, it is Webb and Loy who steal the show.If you are a fan of the iconic and highly stylized Webb, this is a must see performance. Webb, who began his career as a professional dancer, puts on his dancing shoes and manages to do some fast paced dancing which clearly illustrates that Webb was more than a talented actor.Loy is totally believable as the mother, though I have to admit that casting her with Webb was far more believable than I would have imagined.This is a cool escapist comedy that is wonderfully believable and a joy to watch.",5,Laughing Most of the Way,1323993600,"12 16, 2011",2011,1450,"['charming', 'early', '50', 'comedy', 'managed', 'hold', 'up', 'extremely', 'well', 'past', 'half', 'century', 'trial', 'tribulations', 'two', 'efficiency', 'experts/engineers', 'who', 'raise', 'brood', '12', 'kids', '1920', 'Narrated', 'actress', 'Jeanne', 'Crain', 'who', 'tells', 'story', 'retrospect', 'oldest', 'daughter', 'Gilbreath', 'family', 'composed', 'charming', 'riotous', 'vignettes', 'walk', 'family', 'normal', 'process', 'growing', 'up', 'large', 'family', 'Particular', 'focus', 'placed', 'older', 'daughters', 'frustrating', 'attempts', 'mature', 'are', 'often', 'thwarted', 'unsuccessfully', 'father', 'Frank', 'Clifton', 'Webb', 'mother', 'Lillian', 'Myrna', 'Loy', 'stability', 'sane', 'presence', 'amidst', 'inevitable', 'commotion.The', 'script', 'was', 'based', 'book', 'daughter', 'Ernestine', 'Gilbreath', 'funny', 'fast', 'paced', 'children', 'share', 'lot', 'screen', 'time', 'Webb', 'Loy', 'who', 'steal', 'show.If', 'are', 'fan', 'iconic', 'highly', 'stylized', 'Webb', 'must', 'see', 'performance', 'Webb', 'who', 'began', 'career', 'professional', 'dancer', 'dancing', 'shoes', 'manages', 'do', 'fast', 'paced', 'dancing', 'clearly', 'Webb', 'was', 'more', 'talented', 'actor.Loy', 'totally', 'believable', 'mother', 'have', 'admit', 'casting', 'Webb', 'was', 'far', 'more', 'believable', 'would', 'have', 'imagined.This', 'cool', 'escapist', 'comedy', 'wonderfully', 'believable', 'joy', 'watch']",N/A
