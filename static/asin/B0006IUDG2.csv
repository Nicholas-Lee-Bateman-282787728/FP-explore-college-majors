This movie is really good however  disturbing to see how anyone could do that to someone.I recommend watching this movie just to see how wonderful an  actor John Ritter was. Still miss him.,5,A lethal person,1387411200,"12 19, 2013",2013,298,"['thought', 'John', 'Ritter', 'was', 'excellent', 'movie', 'sinister', 'person', 'seeing', 'playing', 'comedy', 'part', 'movie', 'really', 'good', 'however', 'disturbing', 'see', 'how', 'anyone', 'could', 'do', 'someone.I', 'recommend', 'watching', 'movie', 'just', 'see', 'how', 'wonderful', 'actor', 'John', 'Ritter', 'was', 'Still']",N/A
869557,A2KFOBB8RXJTSR,B0006IUDG2,Deborah Mckenzie,"[18, 18]","I have seen this movie several times and it is really scary. It is a true story about a seemingly wonderful doctor/ex-husband (John Ritter) who is always so caring and helpful to his sickly ex-wife (Marg Helgenberger).Marg has had a very strange, undiagnosed disease that began while married to John. She has continually gone from doctor to doctor and grows weaker day by day. However, no one can determine what is causing her symptons.John is remarried, but still keeps very close ties with Marg and his daughters. He seems like the perfect friend, ex-husabnd, and doctor. Suddenly, Johns second wife begins to develop the same symptons as Marg. John takes her out of the country for treatments and when they return from their trip, the wife seems 100% cured. Then, suddenly, the wife dies and John has her cremated.No one seems suspicious, except Marg. She begins an investigation, which leads to the truth about her own illness, as well as the death of the second wife.I think this is so scary because it did happen and it shows how easily a doctor could misrepresent himself and cause harm if he were inclined to do so. It also shows how trusting we as a people are of one another and what the consequences can be.",5,Really Scary,1243555200,"05 29, 2009",2009,1218,"['have', 'seen', 'movie', 'several', 'times', 'really', 'scary', 'true', 'story', 'seemingly', 'wonderful', 'doctor/ex-husband', 'John', 'Ritter', 'who', 'always', 'so', 'caring', 'helpful', 'sickly', 'ex-wife', 'Marg', 'Helgenberger', '.Marg', 'had', 'very', 'strange', 'undiagnosed', 'disease', 'began', 'married', 'John', 'continually', 'gone', 'doctor', 'doctor', 'grows', 'weaker', 'day', 'day', 'However', 'one', 'can', 'determine', 'what', 'causing', 'symptons.John', 'remarried', 'still', 'very', 'close', 'ties', 'Marg', 'daughters', 'perfect', 'friend', 'ex-husabnd', 'doctor', 'Suddenly', 'Johns', 'second', 'wife', 'develop', 'same', 'symptons', 'Marg', 'John', 'country', 'treatments', 'when', 'return', 'trip', 'wife', '100', '%', 'cured', 'Then', 'suddenly', 'wife', 'dies', 'John', 'cremated.No', 'one', 'suspicious', 'Marg', 'investigation', 'truth', 'own', 'illness', 'as', 'well', 'death', 'second', 'wife.I', 'think', 'so', 'scary', 'did', 'happen', 'how', 'easily', 'doctor', 'could', 'misrepresent', 'cause', 'harm', 'were', 'inclined', 'do', 'so', 'also', 'how', 'trusting', 'people', 'are', 'one', 'what', 'consequences', 'can', 'be']",N/A
