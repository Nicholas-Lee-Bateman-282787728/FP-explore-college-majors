Jarrett,"[0, 0]","The Ghost Whisper Series was as good as I remembered it, dealt with real life and gives insight into what may happen when we die, I think JLH is one of these actresses that take the roles to heart and make it seem very real she draws you in and her eyes they are just lovely and show real emotion when people who have passed and cannot find their way to the light once she helps them and the go towards the light she cries and because she is such a great actress you believe that she is really doing this, you forget you are watching a series and think it is for real, well I do anyway.If anyone out there is wondering whether or not to buy the dvd's I would recommend them to anyone because the series is fantastic.",5,Ghost Whisperer,1349654400,"10 8, 2012",2012,716,"['Ghost', 'Whisper', 'Series', 'was', 'as', 'good', 'remembered', 'real', 'life', 'insight', 'what', 'may', 'happen', 'when', 'die', 'think', 'JLH', 'one', 'actresses', 'take', 'roles', 'heart', 'make', 'seem', 'very', 'real', 'eyes', 'are', 'just', 'lovely', 'show', 'real', 'emotion', 'when', 'people', 'who', 'have', 'passed', 'can', 'not', 'find', 'way', 'light', 'once', 'go', 'light', 'cries', 'such', 'great', 'actress', 'believe', 'really', 'doing', 'forget', 'are', 'watching', 'series', 'think', 'real', 'well', 'do', 'anyway.If', 'anyone', 'wondering', 'not', 'buy', 'dvd', 'would', 'recommend', 'anyone', 'series', 'fantastic']",Ghost Whisperer: Seasons 1-4

I'd heard about this show when it first aired but never watched a single episode mainly because I just kinda forgot about it. Then, some months ago, I see that SciFi is broadcasting a number of episodes in a row and, on a whim, I sat down to watch. I got hooked, even from watching eps from season 3 and not having any background from the previous seasons.The show has a nice element of creepiness, an occasional touch of horror, suspense, intrigue, and can also make you laugh. And it can get rather touching, too. The show really does a nice job of blending a lot of emotions together without going to one extreme or the other. The pacing of the stories is good and even though there's an occasional, noticeable, storyline pattern detectable when watching one episode after another, it doesn't take away from the show due to the solid writing.It's a good show. Check it out.",5,"Never Watched it Before, Now I Really Like It",1271635200,"04 19, 2010",2010,892,"['What', 'can', 'say', ""'d"", 'heard', 'show', 'when', 'first', 'aired', 'never', 'watched', 'single', 'episode', 'mainly', 'just', 'kinda', 'forgot', 'Then', 'months', 'see', 'SciFi', 'broadcasting', 'number', 'episodes', 'row', 'whim', 'sat', 'down', 'watch', 'got', 'hooked', 'even', 'watching', 'eps', 'season', '3', 'not', 'having', 'background', 'previous', 'seasons.The', 'show', 'nice', 'element', 'creepiness', 'occasional', 'touch', 'horror', 'suspense', 'intrigue', 'can', 'also', 'make', 'laugh', 'can', 'get', 'rather', 'touching', 'too', 'show', 'really', 'nice', 'job', 'blending', 'lot', 'emotions', 'together', 'going', 'one', 'extreme', 'other', 'pacing', 'stories', 'good', 'even', 'occasional', 'noticeable', 'storyline', 'pattern', 'detectable', 'when', 'watching', 'one', 'episode', ""n't"", 'take', 'away', 'show', 'due', 'solid', 'writing.It', 'good', 'show', 'Check', 'out']",Ghost Whisperer: Seasons 1-4
