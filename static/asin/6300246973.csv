224695,A3MV1KKHX51FYT,6300246973,Acute Observer,"[0, 2]","Bus Stop, 1956 filmThis movie was adapted from a Broadway play. It is set in the rural west of Wyoming by a big city playwright. [Two strikes against it?] A young cowboy who has lived his entire life on an isolated ranch goes wandering. He meets a young woman, Cherry, who lives in a small town and falls in love with her. [Are looks deceiving?] He wants to marry her, but she doesn't want him. Watch the movie to see how that works out.There is the usual amount of drama and personal interaction, comedy from misunderstandings. You get to see parts of a traditional rodeo in the western states, which celebrates working skills (rare today). Marilyn Monroe shows her acting skills, like the others. Does this story seem far-fetched? Was the original Broadway play bowdlerized for Hollywood's audiences? Does the need for a happy ending contradict the earlier story? Believable?The idea of a young woman from show business marrying a rancher and living in rural isolation was part ""Of Mice and Men"".

224699,ANCOMAI0I7LVG,6300246973,Andrew Ellington,"[5, 9]","`Bus Stop' is one of those films that is largely considered the highlight of Marilyn Monroe's career.  She personally viewed this performance as her best and thought that it legitimized her as a serious actress.  While she was denied an Oscar nomination for her work (sadly, she never received one) maybe people feel that it was a serious snub looking back.  With that thought in mind, I decided to indulge last night and what I found was something far different than I expected.I hated this movie.My hatred for this film really doesn't have much to do with Miss Monroe, outside of her sliding accent, but her presence cannot overshadow the film's most eye-rolling of flaws.  Between the script and the ludicrous performance by Don Murray, this film sinks to a serious new low.The film tells the story of a brash young cowboy who ventures into Phoenix to compete in the rodeo and find himself a woman.  He catches a glimpse of Cherie, a young caf&eacute; singer with bigger dreams, and decides that she is going to be his bride.  He then bombards her with his company and forces her into his marriage plans even though she constantly puts up protest.  He then becomes a bully, yelling and screaming and accusing her of trying to trick him and he kidnaps her in an attempt to get her to his farm.  All the while, his older cowboy friend tells him he's wrong but really does nothing about it.  In fact, no one does anything about it while he's chasing her through the nightclub she works at or physically assaulting her at a bus stop, IN FRONT OF MANY PEOPLE.  It's such a bizarre film and the sad thing is that it is supposed to be taken seriously.  This isn't a comedy and none of this is played for laughs.It's just stupid.Murray gives a one-note disaster of a performance, hooting and hollering and acting like a buffoon throughout the entirety of the film until he has a sudden about face and actually delivers a sincere conclusion.  Until that moment, his performance can be described in one word; gross.  How he received an Oscar nomination for this is beyond me.  Monroe is decent here.  She gets the emotional depth of the character, but her accent work is semi-atrocious, and it certainly gets worse and worse as the film moves along.  I much preferred her in `The Misfits' and `Some Like it Hot' where she matched her emotional developments with an effortlessness that she loses here while she struggles to make her accept stick.  Arthur O'Connell is fine, but he's completely overshadowed by his abrasive screen-partner.Overall, this is a mess.  It doesn't say much of anything and it doesn't offer much of anything either, outside of a sultry introduction shot of Monroe in a windowsill.",1,Let the bus pass and then run in the other direction...,1346025600,"08 27, 2012",2012,2698,"['Bus', 'Stop', 'one', 'films', 'largely', 'considered', 'highlight', 'Marilyn', 'Monroe', 'career', 'personally', 'viewed', 'performance', 'best', 'thought', 'legitimized', 'serious', 'actress', 'was', 'denied', 'Oscar', 'nomination', 'work', 'sadly', 'never', 'received', 'one', 'maybe', 'people', 'feel', 'was', 'serious', 'snub', 'looking', 'back', 'thought', 'mind', 'decided', 'indulge', 'last', 'night', 'what', 'found', 'was', 'something', 'far', 'different', 'expected.I', 'hated', 'movie.My', 'hatred', 'film', 'really', ""n't"", 'have', 'much', 'do', 'Miss', 'Monroe', 'sliding', 'accent', 'presence', 'can', 'not', 'overshadow', 'film', 'most', 'eye-rolling', 'flaws', 'script', 'ludicrous', 'performance', 'Don', 'Murray', 'film', 'serious', 'new', 'low.The', 'film', 'story', 'brash', 'young', 'cowboy', 'who', 'ventures', 'Phoenix', 'compete', 'rodeo', 'find', 'woman', 'glimpse', 'Cherie', 'young', 'caf', 'eacute', 'singer', 'bigger', 'dreams', 'going', 'be', 'bride', 'then', 'bombards', 'company', 'marriage', 'plans', 'even', 'constantly', 'up', 'protest', 'then', 'bully', 'yelling', 'screaming', 'accusing', 'trying', 'trick', 'attempt', 'get', 'farm', 'while', 'older', 'cowboy', 'friend', 'wrong', 'really', 'nothing', 'fact', 'one', 'anything', 'chasing', 'nightclub', 'physically', 'assaulting', 'bus', 'stop', 'IN', 'FRONT', 'OF', 'MANY', 'PEOPLE', 'such', 'bizarre', 'film', 'sad', 'thing', 'supposed', 'be', 'taken', 'seriously', ""n't"", 'comedy', 'none', 'played', 'laughs.It', 'just', 'stupid.Murray', 'one-note', 'disaster', 'performance', 'hooting', 'hollering', 'acting', 'buffoon', 'entirety', 'film', 'sudden', 'face', 'actually', 'sincere', 'conclusion', 'moment', 'performance', 'can', 'be', 'described', 'one', 'word', 'gross', 'How', 'received', 'Oscar', 'nomination', 'Monroe', 'decent', 'here', 'emotional', 'depth', 'character', 'accent', 'work', 'semi-atrocious', 'certainly', 'worse', 'worse', 'film', 'moves', 'much', 'preferred', 'Misfits', 'Hot', 'where', 'matched', 'emotional', 'developments', 'effortlessness', 'here', 'make', 'accept', 'stick', 'Arthur', ""O'Connell"", 'fine', 'completely', 'overshadowed', 'abrasive', 'screen-partner.Overall', 'mess', ""n't"", 'say', 'much', 'anything', ""n't"", 'offer', 'much', 'anything', 'sultry', 'introduction', 'shot', 'Monroe', 'windowsill']",Bus Stop VHS
224700,A1GGOC9PVDXW7Z,6300246973,Annie Van Auken,"[1, 1]","William Inge's BUS STOP had a 478 performance run on Broadway between 3/2/55 and 4/21/56. Production on Joshua Logan's film version began prior to the stage show's close. This was the movie debut of both Hope Lange and Don Murray. Edw. G. Robinson Jr. has an uncredited cameo as a rodeo cowboy.Marilyn Monroe's superb performance as an Ozark Mountain gal working her way due west to Hollywood is compromised by a single script flaw. Off-key saloon singer 'Cherie' has for a couple of days been terrorized by yahooing Montana cowboy 'Bo' Decker (Murray), who blew into Phoenix to appear in a rodeo. After just meeting Cherie, Bo loudly insists she will marry him and live on his ranch. He even kidnaps the poor girl at the bus station when she tries to get away from him.They arrive at Grace's remote Rocky Mountain diner (an ""official"" bus stop) in a blizzard. Cherie begs all who will listen to free her from her captor. Carl (Bray), the chivalrous bus driver that considers himself captain of his ship, challenges Bo to a fistfight. They go at it in the storm and Carl whales the tar out of Bo, who eventually gives up when he's caught in an unbreakable wrestling hold.Cherie first watches their fight from inside Grace's and then goes in the cold to beg the two men to stop. Her dread of Bo has suddenly turned to sympathy at the sight of him getting beaten. When Bo, as preface to saying goodbye the next morning, apologizes for scaring heck out of her, ordering her around and abducting her, Cherie melts like an ice cube in a hot frying pan and coos that ""I would go anywhere with you now.""Shrinks would have a field day analyzing the behavior of these two. What sort of message did this send in 1956 to young women seeing the film with a date? He can mistreat you, boss you around, make you go where he wants, do what he wants, as long as your boyfriend/husband apologizes every so often for being a total ogre? Feh.This turn of events is certainly no fault of the actors playing out Inge's ultimately insensitive and perhaps misogynistic  plot. Everyone did a wonderful job in their roles. Kudos all around. As for Cherie and Bo, one can only hope that both survive a marriage forged on the quick and under rather dubious circumstances.Also available onDVD.Parenthetical number preceding title is a 1 to 10 imdb viewer poll rating.(6.8) Bus Stop (1956) - Marilyn Monroe/Don Murray/Arthur O'Connell/Betty Field/Eileen Heckart/Robert Bray/Hope Lange/Hans Conried/Max Showalter",4,"Carl (the bus driver): ""Our next official stop is Grace's Diner, a couple of miles up the road.

I hadn't seen the beginning of the film & I didn't get the chance to see the end. Later I found this on netflix & rented it. Boy was this film different than what I thought it was.This film is quite possibly horrifying. Don't get me wrong, this was well acted & at times this was pretty cute (the ""oh, HONey..."" scenes are my favorite). It's just that the over-reacting by Bo was just horrifying. Initially his reaction could be seen as cute or comedic but as the film progresses his actions became increasingly over the top to the point where it could be seen as abusive in many different ways.I think I finally stopped rooting for Bo & Cherie when he started shouting at her in the bus stop & manhandling her in an attempt to force her to do what he wanted. There just wasn't any way of sugarcoating his actions at that point. (I kept getting visions of him marrying her & later treating her the same way, possibly getting more abusive.) This film just needed more give & take to the interactions between them. It would also have been nice if there had been more softness shown to Bo throughout the film. Rather than showing him to be a guy with no social graces he just came across as a bully.I think where the film failed to hook me is that it tried too hard to walk the line between romantic comedy & drama.

224713,A2P49WD75WHAG5,6300246973,Daniel J. Hamlow,"[6, 10]","So says the fatherly Virgil to his younger friend Bo Decker following a conversation where Virgil suggests its time Bo find himself a woman, &quot;a plain looking, little old gal.&quot;  Bo though wants to find himself an angel.  However, the conversation takes a bit of a chauvinistic tone from the green and inexperienced Bo, who is headed to Phoenix to compete in the rodeo.  Says Bo, &quot;That steer this moment--he didn't wanna get throwed, did he?  Well, I throwed him.  Some wild horse you borke in, he don't wanna be broke, do he?  But you don't let what he wants stop you.  So what makes you think a gal's gonna be any different?&quot;  To paraphrase Virgil in a more contemporary way, &quot;Houston, we've got a problem.&quot;Bo's other problem is that he tends to overdo everything.  He does pushups in the bus, to the surprise and annoyance of the passengers and bus driver.  But the worst flaw in his character is that he has no manners.  As the bus driver asks him later, &quot;Were you born in a barn?&quot;  Well, close, as he has been isolated on a ranch all his life.At the Blue Dragon inn, Bo finds his &quot;angel,&quot; a much put-upon singer named Cheri.  He falls so in love with her that he announces to a stunned Virgil, and more than stunned Cheri, that he has found his girl and is going to marry her tomorrow.Cheri herself has a long string of boyfriends and lovers, something that the naive Bo is unaware of.  In her opening scene, when she's resting on the window sill, she is instantly harassed by rowdy cowboys pawing at her, and then by the manager.  She's clearly not lived a happy life, but she does have a dream to go to Hollywood.  What she's longing for is to be treated with respect, hence her identifying herself as a chanteuse and reminding Bo that her name is Cheri, not Cherry.Eventually, Bo's faults come to a head at the title place, where he gets a much deserved lesson.  I'd find Don Murray likeable if his characterization of Bo wasn't so obnoxious.  I detest rude people sans manners and loud, whooping cowboys, and unfortunately, Bo is both.  While his meanings are noble, it's the way he does it that caused me to flare in exasperation.Arthur O'Connell is a relief in this picture as the wiser and more maturer Virgil.  Virgil gives the fatherly patience and love to Bo, exasperated, angry, and hoping that his young friend grows up.  In the scene where Bo gets his comeuppance, he generates a &quot;this is gonna hurt me more than it's gonna hurt you&quot; atmosphere.This is Hope Lange's debut film as Elma, the young girl on a trip to a concert.  The woman to woman talk between her and MM in the bus is a standout.  And Betty Field stands out as the diner owner Grace, a woman with an Eve Arden-ish sense of humour.Some trivia in this picture.  Marilyn had issue with Don Murray, because of his relative inexperience, and she asked for Hope Lange's hair to be dyed a darker shade of blonde, because after all, MM was THE star.  A bit of ego there.  And the younger LIFE magazine reporter is Casey Adams, who also came out in Niagara as Ray Cutler.  Also, this picture was the first with Marilyn's new acting coach, Paula Strasberg, utilizing Method acting.While this film is generally touted as the one where Marilyn finally could act, I take issue.  Marilyn was &quot;acting&quot; way before then, from her B+ acting in Don't Bother To Knock to her compassionate blonde goofball in The Seven Year Itch.  But if you take into account the strong backwoods accent of an Ozark hillbilly, then yes, her acting is definitely good, but nothing Oscar-worthy here.",4,This trip's gonna be mighty educational,1075334400,"01 29, 2004",2004,3612,"['So', 'fatherly', 'Virgil', 'younger', 'friend', 'Bo', 'Decker', 'following', 'conversation', 'where', 'Virgil', 'time', 'Bo', 'find', 'woman', 'quot', 'plain', 'looking', 'little', 'old', 'gal.', 'quot', 'Bo', 'find', 'angel', 'However', 'conversation', 'bit', 'chauvinistic', 'tone', 'green', 'inexperienced', 'Bo', 'who', 'headed', 'Phoenix', 'compete', 'rodeo', 'Bo', 'quot', 'steer', 'moment', 'did', ""n't"", 'wan', 'get', 'throwed', 'did', 'Well', 'throwed', 'wild', 'horse', 'borke', 'do', ""n't"", 'wan', 'na', 'be', 'broke', 'do', 'do', ""n't"", 'let', 'what', 'stop', 'So', 'what', 'think', 'gal', 'gon', 'na', 'be', 'different', 'quot', 'paraphrase', 'Virgil', 'more', 'contemporary', 'way', 'quot', 'Houston', ""'ve"", 'got', 'problem.', 'quot', 'Bo', 'other', 'problem', 'overdo', 'everything', 'pushups', 'bus', 'surprise', 'annoyance', 'passengers', 'bus', 'driver', 'worst', 'flaw', 'character', 'manners', 'bus', 'driver', 'later', 'quot', 'Were', 'born', 'barn', 'quot', 'Well', 'close', 'been', 'isolated', 'ranch', 'life.At', 'Blue', 'Dragon', 'inn', 'Bo', 'quot', 'quot', 'much', 'put-upon', 'singer', 'named', 'Cheri', 'so', 'love', 'stunned', 'Virgil', 'more', 'stunned', 'Cheri', 'found', 'girl', 'going', 'marry', 'tomorrow.Cheri', 'long', 'string', 'boyfriends', 'lovers', 'something', 'naive', 'Bo', 'unaware', 'opening', 'scene', 'when', 'resting', 'window', 'sill', 'instantly', 'harassed', 'rowdy', 'cowboys', 'pawing', 'then', 'manager', 'clearly', 'not', 'lived', 'happy', 'life', 'have', 'dream', 'go', 'Hollywood', 'What', 'longing', 'be', 'treated', 'respect', 'hence', 'identifying', 'chanteuse', 'reminding', 'Bo', 'name', 'Cheri', 'not', 'Cherry.Eventually', 'Bo', 'faults', 'come', 'head', 'title', 'place', 'where', 'much', 'deserved', 'lesson', ""'d"", 'find', 'Don', 'Murray', 'likeable', 'characterization', 'Bo', 'was', ""n't"", 'so', 'obnoxious', 'detest', 'rude', 'people', 'manners', 'loud', 'whooping', 'cowboys', 'unfortunately', 'Bo', 'meanings', 'are', 'noble', 'way', 'caused', 'flare', 'exasperation.Arthur', ""O'Connell"", 'relief', 'picture', 'wiser', 'more', 'maturer', 'Virgil', 'Virgil', 'fatherly', 'patience', 'love', 'Bo', 'exasperated', 'angry', 'hoping', 'young', 'friend', 'up', 'scene', 'where', 'Bo', 'comeuppance', 'quot', 'gon', 'hurt', 'more', 'gon', 'hurt', 'quot', 'atmosphere.This', 'Hope', 'Lange', 'debut', 'film', 'Elma', 'young', 'girl', 'trip', 'concert', 'woman', 'woman', 'talk', 'MM', 'bus', 'standout', 'Betty', 'Field', 'out', 'diner', 'owner', 'Grace', 'woman', 'Eve', 'Arden-ish', 'sense', 'humour.Some', 'trivia', 'picture', 'Marilyn', 'had', 'issue', 'Don', 'Murray', 'relative', 'inexperience', 'asked', 'Hope', 'Lange', 'hair', 'be', 'dyed', 'darker', 'shade', 'blonde', 'MM', 'was', 'star', 'bit', 'ego', 'there', 'younger', 'LIFE', 'magazine', 'reporter', 'Casey', 'Adams', 'who', 'also', 'came', 'out', 'Niagara', 'Ray', 'Cutler', 'Also', 'picture', 'was', 'first', 'Marilyn', 'new', 'acting', 'coach', 'Paula', 'Strasberg', 'utilizing', 'Method', 'film', 'generally', 'touted', 'one', 'where', 'Marilyn', 'finally', 'could', 'act', 'take', 'issue', 'Marilyn', 'was', 'quot', 'acting', 'quot', 'way', 'then', 'B+', 'acting', 'Do', ""n't"", 'Bother', 'Knock', 'compassionate', 'blonde', 'goofball', 'Seven', 'Year', 'Itch', 'take', 'account', 'strong', 'backwoods', 'accent', 'Ozark', 'hillbilly', 'then', 'yes', 'acting', 'definitely', 'good', 'nothing', 'Oscar-worthy', 'here']",Bus Stop VHS
224714,A1G56KHOUOFWDW,6300246973,"Dianne Foster ""Di""","[9, 14]","In the 1950s, when Broadway was in its heyday, William Inge wrote a number of wonderful stage plays including BUS STOP and PICNIC.  Several of his plays were developed into screen plays and turned into films. In those days, film-stage adaptations gave those of us who lived in the hinterlands access to the New York theater.The film BUS STOP is more &quot;staged&quot; than PICNIC the film, and much more dependent on dialogue. All the action in BUS STOP takes place in a few settings including a Montana bus stop, but if you appreciate clever dialogue you won't be disappointed.Don Murray plays a young man who was orphaned and raised by a friend of his father who is the foreman of the ranch Don inherited on his father's death. Don has spent his whole life living on his ranch and all he wants to do is smooze with horses and cattle. One day, his mentor-guide-friend-foreman suggests since Don has &quot;come of age&quot; i.e. reached manhood, he needs to broaden his scope, get out in the world and maybe even marry. The two plan a trip to the big city (Helena in the 1950s?).In the &quot;big city&quot; Don's mentor exposes him to many things--shops where he can buy new duds, city food, and city night life which consists of a visit to a local honky-tonk/saloon where the fabulous Cherie (Marilyn Monroe) is playing. Cherie is a woman with a past, a long, long past.  She's about the same age as Don, but she is much more worldly.  Don, who has seen few if any other women, thinks she is the most beautiful girl in the world and he falls for her in a big way.  He decides he wants to marry her and take her home to the ranch. She wants no part of this ignorant young cowboy whom she thinks is drunk or crazy, but the earnest young Don will not take no for an answer.  Through a series of misadventures, Cherie, Don and the foreman-friend end up stuck in a Montana bus stop in a blizzard--where most of the &quot;action&quot; takes place.Cherie is still in her costume from the honky-tonk (she left her dressing room under duress) and plenty cold since her outfit leaves little to the imagination. It mostly consists of a bathing-suit like covering which accentuates Marilyn's charms and a long train which Cherie calls a tail. Marilyn spent the whole movie in this outfit and I think it is in a costume museum somewhere. As Don hops back and forth around Cherie, trying to persuade her to come with him to the ranch and be his wife (the foreman-friend who heartily disapproves of Cherie has already told Don he must let her go), Cherie yells &quot;Stop stepping on my tail.&quot;BUS STOP is not an action tale, it is a love story, so women will enjoy it more than the men (well maybe). Don Murray was perfect for his part--the naif, and Marilyn was perfect as the jaded young honky-tonk singer. If you like 1950s stage-screen plays, stories with a country-western theme (right out of a Merle Haggard song), and lots of good dialogue, this is a winner. And, anyone who thinks Marilyn was a dumb blonde better guess again.",5,Another fine adaptation of a New York stage play.....,991958400,"06 8, 2001",2001,3026,"['1950s', 'when', 'Broadway', 'was', 'heyday', 'William', 'Inge', 'wrote', 'number', 'wonderful', 'stage', 'plays', 'including', 'BUS', 'STOP', 'PICNIC', 'Several', 'plays', 'were', 'developed', 'screen', 'plays', 'turned', 'films', 'days', 'film-stage', 'adaptations', 'gave', 'who', 'lived', 'hinterlands', 'access', 'New', 'York', 'theater.The', 'film', 'BUS', 'STOP', 'more', 'quot', 'staged', 'quot', 'PICNIC', 'film', 'much', 'more', 'dependent', 'dialogue', 'action', 'BUS', 'STOP', 'place', 'few', 'settings', 'including', 'Montana', 'bus', 'stop', 'appreciate', 'clever', 'dialogue', 'wo', ""n't"", 'be', 'disappointed.Don', 'Murray', 'young', 'man', 'who', 'was', 'orphaned', 'raised', 'friend', 'father', 'who', 'foreman', 'ranch', 'Don', 'inherited', 'father', 'death', 'Don', 'spent', 'whole', 'life', 'living', 'ranch', 'do', 'smooze', 'horses', 'cattle', 'One', 'day', 'mentor-guide-friend-foreman', 'suggests', 'Don', 'quot', 'come', 'age', 'quot', 'i.e', 'reached', 'manhood', 'broaden', 'scope', 'get', 'out', 'world', 'maybe', 'even', 'marry', 'two', 'plan', 'trip', 'big', 'city', 'Helena', '1950s', 'quot', 'big', 'city', 'quot', 'Don', 'mentor', 'many', 'things', 'shops', 'where', 'can', 'buy', 'new', 'duds', 'city', 'food', 'city', 'night', 'life', 'visit', 'local', 'honky-tonk/saloon', 'where', 'fabulous', 'Cherie', 'Marilyn', 'Monroe', 'playing', 'Cherie', 'woman', 'past', 'long', 'long', 'past', 'same', 'age', 'Don', 'much', 'more', 'worldly', 'Don', 'who', 'seen', 'few', 'other', 'women', 'most', 'beautiful', 'girl', 'world', 'big', 'way', 'marry', 'take', 'home', 'ranch', 'part', 'ignorant', 'young', 'cowboy', 'whom', 'drunk', 'crazy', 'earnest', 'young', 'Don', 'will', 'not', 'take', 'answer', 'series', 'misadventures', 'Cherie', 'Don', 'foreman-friend', 'end', 'up', 'stuck', 'Montana', 'bus', 'stop', 'blizzard', 'where', 'most', 'quot', 'action', 'quot', 'place.Cherie', 'still', 'costume', 'honky-tonk', 'left', 'dressing', 'room', 'duress', 'plenty', 'cold', 'outfit', 'little', 'imagination', 'mostly', 'bathing-suit', 'covering', 'Marilyn', 'charms', 'long', 'train', 'Cherie', 'tail', 'Marilyn', 'spent', 'whole', 'movie', 'outfit', 'think', 'costume', 'museum', 'somewhere', 'Don', 'back', 'forth', 'around', 'Cherie', 'trying', 'persuade', 'come', 'ranch', 'be', 'wife', 'foreman-friend', 'who', 'disapproves', 'Cherie', 'already', 'told', 'Don', 'must', 'let', 'go', 'Cherie', 'yells', 'quot', 'Stop', 'stepping', 'tail.', 'quot', 'BUS', 'STOP', 'not', 'action', 'tale', 'love', 'story', 'women', 'will', 'enjoy', 'more', 'men', 'well', 'maybe', 'Don', 'Murray', 'was', 'perfect', 'part', 'naif', 'Marilyn', 'was', 'perfect', 'jaded', 'young', 'honky-tonk', 'singer', 'like', '1950s', 'stage-screen', 'plays', 'stories', 'country-western', 'theme', 'right', 'Merle', 'Haggard', 'song', 'lots', 'good', 'dialogue', 'winner', 'anyone', 'who', 'Marilyn', 'was', 'dumb', 'blonde', 'better', 'guess', 'again']",Bus Stop VHS

Her not being nominated for her performance in ""Bus Stop"" is proof.Today, we often see actors starring in movies that require them to speak with a certain accent, and their accents come-and-go during the movie. You wont find that here. Marilyn's hillbilly accent remains throughout the film, and it's a very realistic one. Initially, Marilyn's costume was an expensive getup created by the studio, but she herself went to a second-hand shop and found an outfit that she believed her character would actually wear. And, she agreed that she should wear the white, chalky make-up that she does in the film, as her character is one who sleeps during the day (never sees sunlight) and works at night.Marilyn displays a wide range of emotions in this film--happiness, sexiness, sadness, excitement, and downright anger--and we feel every one of them.

224716,A13E0ARAXI6KJW,6300246973,Ed Uyeshima,"[5, 7]","A year after his success with ""Picnic"", director Joshua Logan held the reins for another film adaptation of a William Inge play this time adapted by comedy veteran George Axelrod. The 1956 result is a far more rambunctious and comic story than ""Picnic"" but no less dependent on rural stereotypes to inhabit it. The slight story focuses on a dim-bulb, no-talent singer named Cherie (pronounced by her as Share-REE) who tries to avoid the advances of horny rodeo cowboys in a cheap Phoenix dance hall. However, Cherie is hardly an innocent as she is not above hustling unsuspecting cowboys out of their money to fulfill her dream of getting to Hollywood. Enter Beauregard Decker, ""Bo"" for short, a loudly energetic, self-confident but thoroughly nave young buck. He is in town to not only win the big rodeo competition but also find himself an ""angel"". Once he sets his eyes on Cherie, he is convinced she is his angel and manhandles her to marry him. The rest of the story is really about his pursuit as Cherie tries unsuccessfully to escape from Bo's persistent efforts, and it all ends up in a snowbound diner on the way back to Bo's Montana ranch.Kim Stanley played Cherie to great acclaim on Broadway, but it's safe to say Marilyn Monroe makes the role her own. After a brief break from the screen when she went to New York to study at the Actor's Studio, Monroe threw herself into the part with raw vulnerability and instinctive flair, something she would not replicate fully until her last film, John Huston's ""The Misfits"". It's sometimes a bit studied, but her work here is among her best. Monroe manages a poignant scene with a very young Hope Lange on a bus where she talks about what kind of man she wants, and her faux-pathetic, self-lit version of ""That Old Black Magic"" is classic. Don Murray does well as Bo, though the character gets so obstinate as to throw off the balance of the story. ""Picnic"" veterans Arthur O'Connell and Betty Field lend fine support as Bo's mentor Virgil and sassy diner owner Grace. Eileen Heckart is also terrific as Cherie's only friend Vera. The 2002 DVD, released as part of the Marilyn Monroe Diamond Collection, offers a stills gallery as its one extra.",4,"A Poignant, Funny Marilyn Hits a Career Peak in a Rambunctious Comedy",1160438400,"10 10, 2006",2006,2200,"['year', 'success', 'Picnic', 'director', 'Joshua', 'Logan', 'held', 'reins', 'film', 'adaptation', 'William', 'Inge', 'play', 'time', 'adapted', 'comedy', 'veteran', 'George', 'Axelrod', '1956', 'result', 'far', 'more', 'rambunctious', 'comic', 'story', 'Picnic', 'less', 'dependent', 'rural', 'stereotypes', 'inhabit', 'slight', 'story', 'focuses', 'dim-bulb', 'no-talent', 'singer', 'named', 'Cherie', 'pronounced', 'Share-REE', 'who', 'avoid', 'advances', 'horny', 'rodeo', 'cowboys', 'cheap', 'Phoenix', 'dance', 'hall', 'However', 'Cherie', 'hardly', 'innocent', 'not', 'hustling', 'unsuspecting', 'cowboys', 'money', 'fulfill', 'dream', 'getting', 'Hollywood', 'Enter', 'Beauregard', 'Decker', 'Bo', 'short', 'loudly', 'energetic', 'self-confident', 'thoroughly', 'nave', 'young', 'buck', 'town', 'not', 'only', 'win', 'big', 'rodeo', 'competition', 'also', 'find', 'angel', 'eyes', 'Cherie', 'convinced', 'angel', 'marry', 'rest', 'story', 'really', 'pursuit', 'Cherie', 'unsuccessfully', 'escape', 'Bo', 'persistent', 'efforts', 'up', 'snowbound', 'diner', 'way', 'back', 'Bo', 'Montana', 'ranch.Kim', 'Stanley', 'played', 'Cherie', 'great', 'acclaim', 'Broadway', 'safe', 'say', 'Marilyn', 'Monroe', 'role', 'own', 'brief', 'break', 'screen', 'when', 'went', 'New', 'York', 'study', 'Actor', 'Studio', 'Monroe', 'threw', 'part', 'raw', 'vulnerability', 'instinctive', 'flair', 'something', 'would', 'not', 'replicate', 'fully', 'last', 'film', 'John', 'Huston', 'Misfits', 'sometimes', 'bit', 'studied', 'work', 'here', 'best', 'Monroe', 'poignant', 'scene', 'very', 'young', 'Hope', 'Lange', 'bus', 'where', 'what', 'kind', 'man', 'faux-pathetic', 'self-lit', 'version', 'Old', 'Black', 'Magic', 'classic', 'Don', 'Murray', 'well', 'Bo', 'character', 'so', 'obstinate', 'throw', 'off', 'balance', 'story', 'Picnic', 'veterans', 'Arthur', ""O'Connell"", 'Betty', 'Field', 'lend', 'fine', 'support', 'Bo', 'mentor', 'Virgil', 'sassy', 'diner', 'owner', 'Grace', 'Eileen', 'Heckart', 'also', 'terrific', 'Cherie', 'only', 'friend', 'Vera', '2002', 'DVD', 'released', 'part', 'Marilyn', 'Monroe', 'Diamond', 'Collection', 'stills', 'gallery', 'one', 'extra']",Bus Stop VHS
224717,A15TNUM2PBS6F0,6300246973,"Ei ""crzybookmoovielover""","[4, 7]","I am a long time Marilyn fan...BR>One can imagine my excitement when I found out about this awesome collection of some of Marilyns' movies on dvd...  I had always loved this film because Marilyn was in it, and it is her greatest performance on screen.  She was amazing in this, even if the storyline is sometimes corny and just downright silly.  Marilyn makes this movie so watchable.She had taken a break from 20th Century fox before she made this, and after taking classes at the famous ""actor's studio"" in NYC, she formed her own production company.  I think her whole way of acting changed after these ""method acting"" classes, and ""Bus Stop"" was the first production to showcase this.As far as the dvd goes, it is so much better than it ever looked on television.  If you check out the extras you will get the chance to see a comparision.  To the naked eye, it is utterly amazing what work went into restoring the tale of Cheree' and that ol' bully cowboy, Beauregard Decker, played by Don Murray.It doesn't have as many extras as ""The Seven Year Itch"", which is the best of all the MM dvd's, but it's worth owning just to be able to see Marilyn at her finest work.Marilyn really got into this role.  I remember reading that she would stay in her hillbilly ""chanteuse"" character off the set, and it drove the rest of the crew crazy.  That pasty white complexion, that hillbilly accent, and those little costumes of hers were all just brilliant additions to the outstanding, brilliant acting work that she does in this.""Bus Stop"" is mostly dramatic but has some true comedic momments thrown in, and it's also another movie she sings -- ""That Ol' Black Magic"" is sung by her in that lilting drawl, whilst she self consicously pushes her straps back up on her costume.As much as I love this movie, I didn't love Don Murray.  It was his first film.  While he was sometimes funny, he often annoyed me, but maybe it was the way you were supposed to feel about his character.  She makes it perfectly clear to him that she isn't going to marry him, but he does everything in his power to get her.Marilyn's Cheree' and Ol' Verge, played by Arthur O'Connell, were the most likeable characters in the film.Eileen Heckart plays Cheree's friend.  There are some good character actors in this movie that help make it that much more entertaining.It's a charming movie that will capture your heart at it's sweet ending. Sure, it has it's truly corny and utterly sacchrine sweet dialogue, but it's got Marilyn!A MUST FOR THE TRUE MM FANS!!!For anyone who's never seen any of her movies, this is the one to watch, she is at her peak here.

Her saloon outfit is designed to basically put her breasts in individual containers for individual display...  So those that want to skip the acting part, this is still worth watching.But Marilyn is given the chance to actually show some good emotions here.  OK, so she's playing a role where her job is to mesmerize men.  But what do you want, Marilyn Montroe in a concentration camp?  When we meet her, she is good at hustling drinks, but is kind of sick of the work.  When she finds herself attracted to someone with clean, if naive, motives, she is all of a sudden unsure of herself.When she unintentionally leads a young hunky hayseed into thinking she'll marry him, then her troubles multiply.  At first she tells him to get lost once she realizes he's in over his head.  However, I guess the rules of 1956 allow a guy to drag a lady anywhere he wants to, even if it's against her will.  It's here she gets to show feelings of despair and fatigue coupled with the fact that she's not totally unattracted to him.  In my opinion, she does a good job acting like a female at that time would act.The only bad part I had with the film is one that happens when theatrical productions get translated to film.  The actors sometimes feel they have to orate in theatre fashion, which means saying too much too loudly.  In the movies, you don't have to make sure the last seat in the theatres hear or see your facial expressions, so a little more sublety would have worked.

Gentile,"[5, 8]","This movie, with the exception of ""The Misfits"", probably says more about the person Marilyn Monroe was, then anything you'll ever read about her life. Her portrayal of the little nobody from nowhere, who ""keeps trying to be somebody"", is very touching and moving. But even though many comparisons can be drawn between Marilyn & ""Cherie"",that doesn't take away from the skill & subtlety she puts into her creation. This is a performance, and a brilliant one. And, as acting teacher Lee Strasberg said when reviewers accused her of ""just playing herself"",...""Playing yourself on screen is the hardest thing to do."" Anyone who thinks that Marilyn couldn't act should watch this movie. Director Joshua Logan said years later that he had the usual prejudices against M.M. that most of Hollywood felt towards her, when it was first proposed that she take the role that was originated on stage by Kim Stanley, in the play by William Inge. Logan writes, after recalling his statement that she couldn't pull it off because she couldn't act: ""I  could gargle with salt & vinegar even now as I say that, because I found Marilyn to be one of the great talents of all time."" He also later told of how many of the ideas for the role came from Marilyn herself, saying:  ""She was  brilliant, she was just uneducated."" Some may find this movie ""dated"" (so's the Sistine Chapel). There are no special effects or  blasting music to numb you into thinking you're having a great time. There's just a tremulous, wonderful, heartbreaking performance by an unforgettable screen presence, who, like ""Cherie"", just wanted some respect.

Then I moved on to ""Bus Stop,"" one of Marilyn's most acclaimed roles.  This one I watched all the way through, and I must say I'm astounded at how sensibilities have changed since the 1950s.First of all, I do give kudos to Marilyn for her performance (the only reason for the two stars I gave the movie).  She makes Cherie a very layered and believable character, and I paid little attention to the ""sliding accent"" other reviewers have complained about.  It's the character of Beau I have issues with, and they are enormous.Apparently, movie audiences in the 1950s had no issue with a cowboy on his first visit to the big city deciding that he's going to marry the pretty blonde showgirl - and then becoming violently abusive in his insistence that she return to his ranch and become his wife, a future Cherie strenuously objects to. Despite her having told him ""no"" over and over again, Beau decides it's a good move to abduct her and throw her onto the bus back to Montana, ignoring the protests of his older and more sensible friend.  Later on, during their stop at a diner due to a storm, Beau becomes violent towards another passenger who attempts to defend Cherie, and to his friend, all of which made me sick to my stomach.  All I could think of was, ""This won't end well - there's no way this could end well.""  Of course Beau becomes all soft whispers, apologies and promises, because that's what abusers do.  Behind the whispers, he wants what he wants and won't consider another point of view.  Just horrifying.I wish Marilyn's portrayal of Cherie had been in a better, less stomach-churning movie. She's luminous, funny and woeful, hopeful and spirited. But I found myself wishing that Beau had been stomped to death by one of the rodeo bulls, so that Cherie would be spared a future as the captive wife of an abuser.",2,What a horrifying movie...,1368316800,"05 12, 2013",2013,2144,"[""'ve"", 'known', 'Marilyn', 'Monroe', 'life', 'course', 'have', 'seen', 'portrayed', 'various', 'movies', 'TV', 'shows', 'one', 'reason', 'have', ""n't"", 'investigated', 'movies', 'now.I', 'started', 'Business', 'Show', 'Business', 'gave', 'up', 'hour', 'was', 'so', 'boring', 'Then', 'moved', 'Bus', 'Stop', 'one', 'Marilyn', 'most', 'acclaimed', 'roles', 'one', 'watched', 'way', 'must', 'say', ""'m"", 'astounded', 'how', 'sensibilities', 'have', 'changed', '1950s.First', 'do', 'give', 'kudos', 'Marilyn', 'performance', 'only', 'reason', 'two', 'stars', 'gave', 'movie', 'very', 'layered', 'believable', 'character', 'paid', 'little', 'attention', 'sliding', 'accent', 'other', 'reviewers', 'have', 'complained', 'character', 'Beau', 'have', 'issues', 'are', 'enormous.Apparently', 'movie', 'audiences', '1950s', 'had', 'issue', 'cowboy', 'first', 'visit', 'big', 'city', 'deciding', 'going', 'marry', 'pretty', 'blonde', 'showgirl', 'then', 'becoming', 'violently', 'abusive', 'insistence', 'return', 'ranch', 'become', 'wife', 'future', 'Cherie', 'strenuously', 'having', 'told', 'over', 'again', 'Beau', 'good', 'move', 'abduct', 'throw', 'bus', 'back', 'Montana', 'ignoring', 'protests', 'older', 'more', 'sensible', 'friend', 'Later', 'stop', 'diner', 'due', 'storm', 'Beau', 'violent', 'towards', 'passenger', 'who', 'defend', 'Cherie', 'friend', 'made', 'sick', 'stomach', 'could', 'think', 'was', 'wo', ""n't"", 'end', 'well', 'way', 'could', 'end', 'well', 'course', 'Beau', 'soft', 'whispers', 'apologies', 'promises', 'what', 'do', 'whispers', 'what', 'wo', ""n't"", 'consider', 'point', 'view', 'Just', 'horrifying.I', 'wish', 'Marilyn', 'portrayal', 'Cherie', 'had', 'been', 'better', 'less', 'stomach-churning', 'movie', 'luminous', 'funny', 'woeful', 'hopeful', 'spirited', 'found', 'wishing', 'Beau', 'had', 'been', 'stomped', 'death', 'one', 'rodeo', 'bulls', 'Cherie', 'would', 'be', 'spared', 'future', 'captive', 'wife', 'abuser']",Bus Stop VHS
224722,A1UYL5GIQ8YE77,6300246973,Fred L. Houpt,"[16, 26]","I watched this yesterday and I'm still in shock.  Monroe began to ripen as a dramatic actress just mere days (it seems) before she died.  For sheer hilarity and dramatic weight, she never surpassed her role in ""Some like it hot"".  For dramatic power she was very impressive and powerful in ""The Misfits"".  This film, earlier in her career has been hailed as an early dramatic performace.I am not familiar with the play from whence this film came from.  I just watched it and took it for what it appeared.  I found Don Murray's characterization of the cowboy to be a negative distraction, largely because instead of a real person he came across as a living comic-book character.  There was not a moment when he was on the screen except for his quiet moments of remorse at the end, when he was not sounding like a lunatic.  Other commentators have noted that this over the top performance was supposed to be this way, deliberatly to be funny.  Well, in my time, at the end of 2006, this type of behaviour looks stupid, ridiculous and unbelievable.  Further, Murray spends almost every second in the film shouting at the top of his lungs as if this is the way most cowboys fresh off the farm act when hitting the big city for the first time. Ahhhhh, no: I don't think so.  The director (Logan) must have encouraged him to act this way and for me it makes him look like an imbecile.  Honestly, his acting just made me so uncomfortable from the beginning to the end I wish I could have stopped the film.Then we have Monroe.  She looked as she always does, beautiful.  But, I did notice that she kept changing the inflection of her voice, as if not quite yet sure of how to morph from a blonde-bombshell-dimwit into a real person, a dramatic presence.  She just comes in and out of the ""place"" and it strikes me now as quite a fascinating moment in her career, almost at the cusp of breaking out into better acting.  Her attempts at an accent come and go and if we were not so distracted by what she looked like we'd take closer note of it.  Her skin looked so white next to the cowboy that she almost looked sickly.  The best moments were when she was staring into a mirror (very well set up shot) and the doubts and fears that crossed her face felt every bit as real as one could imagine.All in all I was shocked at how bad the film looked, given the age in which we live.  The cartoonish characterization that Murray gives just looks ridiculous and hence hard to relate to.  I just could not imagine any cowboy acting like a wild baboon on steroids.

She is great in it. It's one of her best performances. As Cheri, she gives a dazzling performance of 'Black Magic', and it's great listening to her in her hillbilly accent. The final scenes where her face take up the entire screen was great directing and she looked as beautiful as an angel. Her comic timing was delivered perfectly, and the costumes she wore in this movie lead to some of her greatest still photograph.So why only 4 stars? The rest of the cast did a great job, Virg, Elma, Grace, and Carl. Who did I leave out? That's right, Bo. Don Murray single-handedly ruins this movie. His cowboy mannerisms are waaaay over the top, he overacts every scene he's in, he's rude, stupid, and to tell you the truth, Marilyn ending up with him is so unbelievable, it makes you just want to scratch your head.Now I know that Bo was supposed to be an inexperienced cowboy right off the ranch, but no one is going to arrive in a city and acts like he owns the world. Kidnapping a woman (with a lasso of all things) and dragging her on the bus is a stretch, but when Bo finally gets his butt kicked by Carl, and learns a lesson in humility, and then Marilyn falls for him, well... I can't believe someone would give up their Hollywood dreams and go to a ranch with a doous like Bo.Again This was a great performance by Marilyn, watch it for her. I'm sure you will.

As Cherie, she is beautiful and plays a character from some small town in Arkansas where guys started pursuing her when she was 14.  From a perspective 50 years later, some of the acting seems a bit over the top, but it played well in its day.Don Murray plays the ranch hand Bo who wants to force Cherie to marry him.  Murray earned his only Oscar nomination for Best Supporting Actor in 1956 for the role.  Today, his style seems too animated to be believable.  However, he certainly performs with gusto.The supporting cast is also excellent.  Robert Bray who was in ""The Caine Mutiny"" plays Carl the bus driver who gives Bo a licking.  Arthur O'Connell who had two Oscar nominations for ""Picnic"" in 1955 & ""Anatomy of a Murder"" in 1959 does a good job as Virgil, Bo's buddy that tries to counsel him.  Betty Field plays Grace, the cafe owner with a strut out of ""Annie Get Your Gun.""  She has appeared in ""Picnic,"" ""The Great Gatsby,"" & ""King's Row.""  Eileen Heckert with her deep voice plays Cherie's friend Vera.  Heckert was nominated for the supporting Oscar for ""The Bad Seed"" in 1956 and won in 1972 for ""Butterflies Are Free.""  She does an excellent job of grounding the film with a sense of reality.  Hope Lange puts in a brief appearance as Elma Duckworth who works at the diner.  She's lovely in a small role.  The following year, she would get a Best Supporting Actress nomination for ""Peyton Place"" and go on to win hearts in the 1960s in TV's ""The Ghost & Mrs. Muir.""""Bus Stop"" seems a bit dated now 50+ years later.

I have forgotten how special she was and how she dominated every scene she was in.  This was one of her lesser films.  And yet, her magic is there.The plot is a bit hokey but it works.  Don Murray is cast as an innocent cowboy without any experience with women.  When he leaves Montana to compete in a rodeo, he meets Marilyn Monroe.  She's singing in a bar and has obviously had a shady past.  This doesn't matter to him, though.  He falls in love with her.  And, much to the distress of his sidekick, brilliantly played by Arthur O'Connell, he kidnaps his lady love and puts her on the bus with him going back to Montana.  She protests of course.  And when the bus is stranded in a snowstorm and everyone must spend the night in a roadside diner, the plot thickens.  It all ends happily, though.  And it looks like Marilyn and Don will live happily ever after.There is nothing special about this film except for the nostalgia.  The screenplay is old fashioned and stilted.  The situations are predicable.  Also, once the theme was developed, we didn't need a dozen ways to develop it.  That said, I must say I enjoyed the film.  I had almost forgotten what 1956 was like.

The movie is over 50 years old and did not have the feel of meeting expectations.  I had heard Don Murray was up for an Oscar and that Marilyn won a Golden Globe for this.  My expectations were high, especially since I had just seen Marilyn in ""Some Like It Hot"" and lifted with laughter between her, Tony Curtis and Jack Lemmon.However, ""Bus Stop"", the movie, treaded water, and personalities were over the top.  I cringed at the histrionic personality of Cherie (Marilyn Monroe) and the ""aw gee"" cowboy buck named ""Bo""(Don Murray) that treats Cherie like a calf to lasso and haul back to his ranch in Montana.The story centers around Bo, the young rancher, rodeo rider who falls in love with a ""been round the block"" cafe singer, Cherie.  He wants to marry her the minute he sees her and after the rodeo forces her on the bus back to his Montana Ranch.  Cheri tries to escape this ardent admirer but he just does not give up.  The only part I laughed at was when he promised her new kitchen appliances, washer and a sink.  It was the only laugh I had. Marilyn is OK in this movie, her acting is fair-she is trying hard to make it funny - and the close up glamour shots show off her shimmering golden beauty, but that is not enough to hold one's interest.

224757,A2WPAUTK46SQ31,6300246973,Steven Johnson,"[5, 7]","Bus Stop is the wildly underrated story of two young people at a crossroads (both figurative and literal) in their lives. She is hustling from the Ozarks to Hollywood, and he is journeying from his native Montana down to Phoenix to become a rodeo champion. It also presents a powerful message on the growing feminism of the era and how it can coexist and even thrive within more old-fashioned ideas about gender roles.He comes from a small town and has seen very few ""gals"" in his life. From the instant he sees Marilyn's character, he falls instantly (and foolishly) in love with her and decides to make her his bride. She is flattered by his chivalry while also fearful of it; having only known men as semi-abusive clients, she is unable to deal with men who treat her well.This seemingly perfect pairing deteriorates as their journey continues; his once-chivalrous ways become obsessive and she regrets having accepted his courtship. She asserts herself by denying herself to him, seeing him as an obstacle to her Hollywood dreams. To deter him, she cites her past of having ""many boyfriends"" as a foil to his pureness and virginity.This conflict inspires one of the best movie lines of the 1950s. He reassures her that her past does not reflect poorly on her or his feelings for her. ""I like the way you are, so what do I care how you got that way?""The film is ultimately about compromise and sacrifice. Neither has exactly the future they had envisioned for themselves, but by the end they don't see it as a sacrifice but rather a new future just as promising as their original dreams.A bus stop is a single point on a greater journey. It is a place of interaction, collision, and reflection. After all the action takes place though, the trip must continue, progressing ever onward toward a better place.",4,Good movie with a great performance from Marilyn,1369440000,"05 25, 2013",2013,1809,"['Bus', 'Stop', 'wildly', 'underrated', 'story', 'two', 'young', 'people', 'crossroads', 'figurative', 'literal', 'lives', 'hustling', 'Ozarks', 'Hollywood', 'journeying', 'native', 'Montana', 'down', 'Phoenix', 'become', 'rodeo', 'champion', 'also', 'powerful', 'message', 'growing', 'feminism', 'era', 'how', 'can', 'coexist', 'even', 'thrive', 'more', 'old-fashioned', 'ideas', 'gender', 'roles.He', 'small', 'town', 'seen', 'very', 'few', 'gals', 'life', 'instant', 'Marilyn', 'character', 'instantly', 'foolishly', 'love', 'make', 'bride', 'flattered', 'chivalry', 'also', 'fearful', 'having', 'only', 'known', 'men', 'semi-abusive', 'clients', 'unable', 'deal', 'men', 'who', 'treat', 'well.This', 'seemingly', 'perfect', 'pairing', 'deteriorates', 'journey', 'once-chivalrous', 'ways', 'become', 'obsessive', 'having', 'accepted', 'courtship', 'denying', 'seeing', 'obstacle', 'Hollywood', 'dreams', 'deter', 'past', 'having', 'many', 'boyfriends', 'foil', 'pureness', 'virginity.This', 'conflict', 'one', 'best', 'movie', 'lines', '1950s', 'past', 'not', 'reflect', 'poorly', 'feelings', 'like', 'way', 'are', 'what', 'do', 'care', 'how', 'got', 'way', 'film', 'ultimately', 'compromise', 'sacrifice', 'exactly', 'future', 'had', 'envisioned', 'end', 'do', ""n't"", 'see', 'sacrifice', 'rather', 'new', 'future', 'just', 'as', 'promising', 'original', 'dreams.A', 'bus', 'stop', 'single', 'point', 'greater', 'journey', 'place', 'interaction', 'collision', 'reflection', 'action', 'place', 'trip', 'must', 'continue', 'progressing', 'ever', 'onward', 'better', 'place']",Bus Stop VHS
