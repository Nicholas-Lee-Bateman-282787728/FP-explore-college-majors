1088428,A1ITCVZ46MUB3A,B000T4T8Z0,A Hot Whizzer Summer...,"[1, 1]","I started watching this as one of the first anime I watched by choice rather than being coerced into it by my wife. I had heard the name somewhere before, and as I watched the series I think I recall it being mentioned as having similarities to Final Fantasy 13.In truth, the story is a bit misleading. As others have mentioned, it started out as your typical ""strange beautiful girl(Hakari) shows up, monsters attack her, guy(Takeru) becomes super powered and rescues her, defeating the monster in the process"". However, the series then quickly changes into a strange kind of love story until the last couple of episodes. For two episodes it ignores the title characters to bring in another mysterious girl (Akiri) before tossing her into the background for almost half the series. In reality, her entire presence seemed unnecessary for the story, which could have existed just as easily without the ""split in two"" subplot.The story continues with an awkward love triangle between Takeru, Hakari, and Takeru's cousin who is apparently in love with him. Furthermore, Takeru seems to be dealing with some serious personality problems as he continually pushes off the interests of Hakari. You then have the second mysterious girl Akari and her love interest, Ryou, who seem to parallel Taleru and Hakari's romance, yet seem to do it better. The side characters consists of a slutty american scientist who remains drunk for almost the entire show, two horny boys who only think and talk about getting a girl, two conceded girls who can only think and talk about fashion  and hunky boys, a set of bewildering parents, and a very bossy sister.The show shows tons of nudity. The nudity is neither needed nor expected in many cases. In one case, the slutty american Jennifer decides to take a shower with one of the other girls. Why? Noone knows. You could argue that nudity is art, but as they conveniently always cover up the guys and over expose every part of the girls, it is clear the kind of fanservice they are trying to offer. It's not that I am complaining about fanservice, but nudity for the sake of nudity just seems pretty shallow.Anyway, the entire story feels like a bunch of filler. The story wasn't long enough or complex enough to justify the amount of filler and the filler wasn't enough to be satisfying in and of itself. As others have mentioned, the story only actually progress in maybe 5 of the 12 episodes. And Hakiri and Takeru's relationship felt underdeveloped to justify the end, just as their relationship started going somewhere it kind of stopped until the climax of the series.I feel the series would have done much better as a 2 hour movie and probably could have cut out alot of the filler. However, it was a very fun show, not too long as to feel tedious to watch, you can knock it out of your way in a single afternoon if you have all the disks. I teared up in the end so it did manage to trigger an emotional response from me.It gets 3 stars for being full of filler. Every 24 minute episode includes a 2-3 minute recap and also manages to include recap scenes in almost every episode. Cutting out the repeats and the title sequence and credits, your looking at less than 4 hours of material, with much of that being filler episodes. It's fun and easy to watch, but I would say it's a rental. If you see it and decide you love it, then by all means buy, but I hope to think there are some better anime's out there.",3,One of my first animes,1311465600,"07 24, 2011",2011,3445,"['started', 'watching', 'one', 'first', 'anime', 'watched', 'choice', 'rather', 'being', 'coerced', 'wife', 'had', 'heard', 'name', 'somewhere', 'before', 'watched', 'series', 'think', 'recall', 'being', 'mentioned', 'having', 'similarities', 'Final', 'Fantasy', '13.In', 'truth', 'story', 'bit', 'misleading', 'others', 'have', 'mentioned', 'started', 'out', 'typical', 'strange', 'beautiful', 'girl', 'Hakari', 'up', 'monsters', 'attack', 'guy', 'Takeru', 'super', 'powered', 'defeating', 'monster', 'process', 'However', 'series', 'then', 'quickly', 'changes', 'strange', 'kind', 'love', 'story', 'last', 'couple', 'episodes', 'two', 'episodes', 'title', 'characters', 'bring', 'mysterious', 'girl', 'Akiri', 'tossing', 'background', 'almost', 'series', 'reality', 'entire', 'presence', 'seemed', 'unnecessary', 'story', 'could', 'have', 'existed', 'just', 'easily', 'split', 'two', 'subplot.The', 'story', 'awkward', 'love', 'triangle', 'Takeru', 'Hakari', 'Takeru', 'cousin', 'who', 'apparently', 'love', 'Furthermore', 'Takeru', 'be', 'dealing', 'serious', 'personality', 'problems', 'continually', 'interests', 'Hakari', 'then', 'have', 'second', 'mysterious', 'girl', 'Akari', 'love', 'interest', 'Ryou', 'who', 'seem', 'parallel', 'Taleru', 'Hakari', 'romance', 'yet', 'seem', 'do', 'better', 'side', 'characters', 'slutty', 'american', 'scientist', 'who', 'drunk', 'almost', 'entire', 'show', 'two', 'horny', 'boys', 'who', 'only', 'think', 'talk', 'getting', 'girl', 'two', 'conceded', 'girls', 'who', 'can', 'only', 'think', 'talk', 'fashion', 'hunky', 'boys', 'set', 'bewildering', 'parents', 'very', 'bossy', 'sister.The', 'show', 'tons', 'nudity', 'nudity', 'needed', 'expected', 'many', 'cases', 'one', 'case', 'slutty', 'american', 'Jennifer', 'take', 'shower', 'one', 'other', 'girls', 'Why', 'Noone', 'could', 'argue', 'nudity', 'art', 'conveniently', 'always', 'cover', 'up', 'guys', 'expose', 'part', 'girls', 'clear', 'kind', 'fanservice', 'are', 'trying', 'offer', 'not', 'am', 'complaining', 'fanservice', 'nudity', 'sake', 'nudity', 'just', 'pretty', 'shallow.Anyway', 'entire', 'story', 'feels', 'bunch', 'filler', 'story', 'was', ""n't"", 'long', 'enough', 'complex', 'enough', 'justify', 'amount', 'filler', 'filler', 'was', ""n't"", 'enough', 'be', 'satisfying', 'others', 'have', 'mentioned', 'story', 'only', 'actually', 'progress', 'maybe', '5', '12', 'episodes', 'Hakiri', 'Takeru', 'relationship', 'felt', 'underdeveloped', 'justify', 'end', 'just', 'relationship', 'started', 'going', 'somewhere', 'kind', 'stopped', 'climax', 'series.I', 'feel', 'series', 'would', 'have', 'done', 'much', 'better', '2', 'hour', 'movie', 'probably', 'could', 'have', 'cut', 'out', 'alot', 'filler', 'However', 'was', 'very', 'fun', 'show', 'not', 'too', 'long', 'feel', 'tedious', 'watch', 'can', 'knock', 'way', 'single', 'afternoon', 'have', 'disks', 'teared', 'up', 'end', 'did', 'manage', 'trigger', 'emotional', 'response', 'me.It', '3', 'stars', 'being', 'full', 'filler', '24', 'minute', 'episode', '2-3', 'minute', 'recap', 'also', 'include', 'recap', 'scenes', 'almost', 'episode', 'Cutting', 'out', 'repeats', 'title', 'sequence', 'credits', 'looking', 'less', '4', 'hours', 'material', 'much', 'being', 'filler', 'episodes', 'fun', 'easy', 'watch', 'would', 'say', 'rental', 'see', 'decide', 'love', 'then', 'means', 'buy', 'hope', 'think', 'are', 'better', 'anime', 'there']",This Ugly Yet Beautiful World: Complete Collection

Each with their own character/disfunction.4) If you enjoy feeling like ""your saying goodbye to friends"" when the last episode is concluding.

Let me start off by saying the reason I gave it 4 stars is because of my opinion of the ending, it just seems to go a little extra nuts in the last episode and then left me slightly disappointed with the way it all ended so for that it lost a star. However, that being said aside from the feeling of disappointment at the ending the rest of the show is great. It is one of those that is drawn well enough that I do find myself thinking ""Gee she is cute."" rather then ""My that's nicely drawn"" So yeah good animation. The story while lacking an original plot(as most anime and tv shows in general all follow the same basic plots these days) was a generally good story with a definite intuitive twist on a relatively staple anime plot.

Hikaru has no memory, but she said she came from the sky. After finding Hikaru, monsters start to attack. The monsters are after Hikaru. What secret could Hikaru's past hold that would cause the monsters to want her death so badly. They soon find out that Hikaru is here to fulfill a terrible mission. But after falling in love with Takeru, and making so many great friends Hikaru has 2nd thoughts.This anime was surprisingly good. It has good animation and some pretty well known voice actors. There is a good mix of action, comedy, and romance. The story is interesting as well. The only complaint I have is that the series is too short. The characters are very interesting and I wanted to watch their relationships develop further. This anime ends pretty quickly, and the ending tugs at your heart strings. I think the emotion could have been so much greater if they had made it a 24 or 26 episode series. I don't like it when an anime is 12 or 13 episodes. That's only about 4 hours. It takes more time than that to create a great story in detail.  There are some great animes that are that length. For example: Air is one of the best animes ever made and it is short. But the best ones are usually longer. If the time is taken to develop characters and plots deeper, the anime series has a greater potential. That being said; this anime is very good.

Johnson,"[2, 2]","I watched this on Netflix streaming because it seemed like it was going to be somewhat interesting.The GoodI liked the friend of the main guy and his development with the red haired girl he found in the woods, I enjoyed how slow and steady the writers went with him, the red haired girl, and his little sister. I honestly wished that the entire anime was about those three.The BadCliche and borrowed way too much from other animes like Elfen Lied yet they decided to use all the boring parts instead. This show is honestly what Elfen Lied would have become if it was written by lazy incompetent writers who just wanted an excuse to draw boobs. The story is pretty much about a high school boy who has no parents yet live in a large boarding type house with no adult supervision who finds a naked girl floating out of a tree thing and decides he's going to protect her forever, then some tentacle beast comes out of nowhere and the boy transforms into sonic the Hedgehog and fights it off, then he takes the girl home and tells all his friends/boarding people about how he met her and they all instantly believe him. They even sew up a cosplay dress outfit for the girl to wear (because for some reason no one could find this girl a regular shirt and a pair of pants). And of course just like Elfen Lied the female cousin of the main guy is in love with him and harbors jealousy of the main alien girl but it like the plot it goes no where.Anyway, although the main girl is from another planet or whatever she speaks perfect Japanese, has Japanese manners and even cooks like a professional Japanese chef. Of course she shows her boobs and butt while she does it. *Sigh* in other words shes cute, dumb, sweet, has a nice body, can cook like a professional chef, and clings to the main guy.The entire anime (all but the stand alone scenes between the friend, the red haired alien girl and his sister)focuses on eechi fan service (Can you say random breast shots in every episode?), a drunk tactless American ""scientist"" Who gets drunk naked, and just decides to run off at the mouth giving out ""Hypothesis"" aka Exposition about the girls and the story because heaven forbid if they show us by actually developing the story when they can just just randomly have characters sit around naked and literally explain everything to us. They try to pull more from Elfen Lied by giving the main girl some sort of split personality that seems evil. Yet unlike Elfen Lied they use it as a cop out to keep the girl good. Like I said it's Elfen Lied written by lazy horny writers.Honestly, I didn't care for the main guy and the main alien girl, the scientist, or their friends (minus the three I mentioned before.

1088435,A3AAK33K3BUUTM,B000T4T8Z0,trashcanman,"[26, 28]","During the climax of ""This Ugly Yet Beautiful World"", a scientist bearing witness to a ""typical"" anime apocalypse scenario muses that she could be the first on record to put forth a complete account of the cause of Earth's mass extinctions.  Then she looks at the madness around her and despairs, ""But how do I explain THIS!?"",  That's kind of how I feel trying to write a review that does this show justice without handing out major spoilers like candy.  I'll tread lightly, but since the twist becomes fairly obvious early on, I've got some room to work.  While the first 8 episodes of this series languish in every cliche-yet-comfortable anime standard possible, the last disc really starts to elevate the show to a higher level, but then it kind of stalls just as it finally begins to reach the level of it's predecessors, ""Neon Genesis Evangelion"" and ""FLCL"".  Too bad; the ambition was there, but in the end this series, while certainly worth a look, just doesn't live up to it's pedigree.The story begins as your standard shy boy meets perfect girl from outer space yarn.  There's love at first sight, a giant monster attack, protagonist Takeru tranforming into a Devilman-esque protector and all that jazz; but we also get the first clue that maybe cute alien girl -dubbed Hikari (meaning ""light"")- isn't what she appears to be.  Then here come Takeru's childhood friend/unrequited love, jealous sex-crazed hangers-on, coy awkward romance, rampant fan service and now we're back in cliche town.  When Hikari's ""sister"" -named Akari (also meaning ""light"")- is discovered by one of Takeru's friends living in the woods, the story deepens some, but also deviates from the characters we were just getting to know for multiple episodes.  Turns out that most of the characters are simply there to be comic relief stereotypes, expositionists, or both so there's not much to explore.  Take Jennifer, an American living in the same apartments as Takeru.  As a scientist, she is often pondering aloud the plot as it unfolds before us, even if you are unaware of it at the time, and when she isn't, she is getting drunk, making lewd comments, and getting naked.  Fun, but boorish.Like I said, the first 2/3 of this show are pretty pedestrian, but as evidence of Hikari's true nature begins to mount, the tension really starts to build.  You will see it coming from a mile away, but I still got goose pimples when the cloyingly sweet anime girl I'd known awakened to her true nature and coldly announced her purpose to shocked friends and family.  This is an ugly world, one where even the best people you know only help others for selfish reasons and are often incapable of loving themselves or, therefore, anyone else.  To obtain a new start, one must discard the old, useless past both physically, psychologically, and evolutionarily.  Hikari is the harbinger of that new beginning.  Brilliant ideas and a whole new awareness sweep through the series  and it's main characters at this point as the world is engulfed in a somehow menacing swarm of crimson butterflies.  This is more than a little bit reminiscent of some of Eva's finest moments, but the brilliance doesn't last long.  The final episodes, while epic, slow down to a crawl and deliver a bittersweet, reflectuive, but somewhat anticlimactic ending that just makes you wish the show had been paced a little better and the ideas presented within explored more completely and expanded upon.""This Ugly Yet Beautiful World"" may not quite live up to it's ambitious title or it's anime forerunners, but it is still a decent little series.  It even has the good sense to poke fun at itself from time to time (referencing ""Please Teacher"" certainly earned some points with me).  For anime newbies, the show is ideal since it's biggest flaw is it's reliance on tried-and-true anime standards that every otaku has seen hundreds of times over.  The characters -one dimensional as they are- are likeable and the climax is quite an impressive spectacle.  As it's title implies there is both good and bad within this series but, like life itself, it is worth the trip if only to see what is around the next bend.  But I wonder if this and other shows' increasing reliance on tried-and-true conventions may signal that the art form has reached it's peak and is about to crash itself.  Is ""This Ugly Yet Beautiful World"" to anime what Hikari-chan is to Earth's lifeforms, a sign that it is time for a change?
