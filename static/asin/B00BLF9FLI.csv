1635323,A1KFWSYZIOBI3Y,B00BLF9FLI,"DaRRen ""Darren""","[1, 2]","You have probably seen this movie before. It just had different titles. It is the well-worn story of the young white couple who moves away from the city without any planning whatsoever, in order to escape/raise new child/get new job/recover from bad experience, etc. In this case, a new child caused the departure from urban existence.Pretty soon, as always happens in this movie, things become very creepy in the new home. Next, the couple starts to fight constantly, presumably lacking the coping skills to go through stress as a couple without harming each other. They make awful decisions (one happened in a grocery store); then violence and bloodshed happen, until they finally escape the evil presence. The End.Despite this plot being performed repeatedly, this movie doesn't even execute in a decent fashion. I can deal with a little choppiness or lack of structure (for artistic purposes), but this movie is incoherent due to a lack of thoughtfulness by the director. Many questions go unanswered longer than they should, and when they are finally addressed, the explanations are pretty anticlimatic.  Some reviewers have described the ending as a ""twist,"" but I think it was twist only by accident. The directors failed to consider how their ending conflicted with earlier parts of the movie (particularly, the ubiquitous ghostly female appearing and disappearing at will, moving objects, possessing paranormal powers, etc.).  If the creators did this intentionally, then they failed miserably.Despite the flaws with the plot, the production was decent; the actors did a fine job; and the setting was adequate. These qualities, however, cannot overcome the weak story line. This movie could have earned a much higher rating with closer attention to the script. Nonetheless, if you watch it with these caveats in mind, you could have a decent 1.5 hour journey - good for weekend afternoon viewing.",2,"Somewhat Entertaining, But Plot Diminishes Quality of Film",1371427200,"06 17, 2013",2013,1905,"['have', 'probably', 'seen', 'movie', 'just', 'had', 'different', 'titles', 'well-worn', 'story', 'young', 'white', 'couple', 'who', 'away', 'city', 'planning', 'whatsoever', 'order', 'escape/raise', 'new', 'child/get', 'new', 'job/recover', 'bad', 'experience', 'etc', 'case', 'new', 'child', 'caused', 'departure', 'urban', 'existence.Pretty', 'soon', 'always', 'movie', 'things', 'become', 'very', 'creepy', 'new', 'home', 'Next', 'couple', 'fight', 'constantly', 'presumably', 'lacking', 'coping', 'skills', 'go', 'through', 'stress', 'couple', 'harming', 'other', 'make', 'awful', 'decisions', 'one', 'happened', 'grocery', 'store', 'then', 'violence', 'bloodshed', 'happen', 'finally', 'escape', 'evil', 'presence', 'End.Despite', 'plot', 'being', 'performed', 'repeatedly', 'movie', ""n't"", 'even', 'execute', 'decent', 'fashion', 'can', 'deal', 'little', 'choppiness', 'lack', 'structure', 'artistic', 'purposes', 'movie', 'incoherent', 'due', 'lack', 'thoughtfulness', 'director', 'Many', 'questions', 'go', 'unanswered', 'longer', 'should', 'when', 'are', 'finally', 'addressed', 'explanations', 'are', 'pretty', 'anticlimatic', 'reviewers', 'have', 'described', 'ending', 'twist', 'think', 'was', 'twist', 'only', 'accident', 'directors', 'failed', 'consider', 'how', 'ending', 'conflicted', 'earlier', 'parts', 'movie', 'particularly', 'ubiquitous', 'ghostly', 'female', 'appearing', 'disappearing', 'will', 'moving', 'objects', 'possessing', 'paranormal', 'powers', 'etc.', 'creators', 'did', 'intentionally', 'then', 'failed', 'flaws', 'plot', 'production', 'was', 'decent', 'actors', 'did', 'fine', 'job', 'setting', 'was', 'adequate', 'qualities', 'however', 'can', 'not', 'overcome', 'weak', 'story', 'line', 'movie', 'could', 'have', 'earned', 'much', 'higher', 'rating', 'closer', 'attention', 'script', 'Nonetheless', 'watch', 'caveats', 'mind', 'could', 'have', 'decent', '1.5', 'hour', 'journey', 'good', 'weekend', 'afternoon', 'viewing']",After Dark Originals: Dark Circles

One of the After Dark season one movies, &#34;Unrest,&#34; actually gave me nightmares, so I am disapponted that the After Dark series has run out of steam. I bought &#34;dark Circles&#34; when it first became available, and was bothered enough to want to see it again, but couldn't remember the title or from which of my collections it came. I am happy to have relocated it after much thought and searching. Anyone who has ever had trouble sleeping or gone through long periods of sleeplessness for some reason (I worked back-to-back night and day shifts for several years) will relate to the feeling you get when you are exhausted even to the point of seeing things that aren't there (I nearly swerved off the road on the way to my night shift to miss a guy who wasn't there). Some terrible things happen when this guy finally gets some sleep, and the nightmarish feeling of the final scene might make you wonder if he ever woke at all. This is probably a four, but I'm giving it five so that those who stop only for highly-rated movies might consider giving it a twirl.

When I see a film like  this, I take it as only natural that the occupants will either be dead, institutionalized or, after much mental and physical anguish, departed for more salubrious housing.I know nothing of anyone associated with the film in any way, but think that they did a decent  job within narrowly circumscribed limits. The lead male seemed already half shot before the couple (with newborn baby) moved into their new surroundings. The woman appeared bewildered from the moment they left for the ""country"". The other  parts were negligible to the central action of the film. It was OK for the creators and Director to play it low key and inexplicable throughout, but not OK for them to provide no meaningful source for the happeningsMy  recommendation: if you like haunted house movies this is generally acceptable and not a grade B horror film. If you do not like unresolved puzzles, you are likely to be dissatisfied with the film.

Imagine my surprise when I found out that this After Dark film was written and directed by a member of the comedy team &#8220;Broken Lizard&#8221; who you might know from &#8220;Super Troopers&#8221; and such. I wasn&#8217;t expecting that and once I learned that I truly didn&#8217;t know what to expect. It turns out that this was a really good film and the ending was great.A couple with a newborn baby is trying to find the perfect place to watch their child grow. So they decide that the city life is no longer for them with the new addition to the family. When finally deciding upon a house in the country they settle in and look forward to their new life together. But being parents is a lot harder than they thought it would be with sleepless nights and a baby needing constant attention. They go on without sleep for so long that they start seeing things that are not there, or are they.Writer/director Paul Soter of Broken Lizard fame does a great job with this film letting things build slowly instead of forcing things like most horror films do nowadays. He does a good job letting the tension build without things getting boring which is tricky with films like this. It was cool to learn that this film was based on things that happened to him and his wife. That is just one of many things you learn while listening to the commentary on the DVD.Acting wise this is another high spot of the film as stars  Johnathon Schaech and Pell James did great here. They were very believable in their portrayals of a couple who go from loving and excited to tied and beat to scared and paranoid. They really carry the film with strong performances, in fact I believe that even if you didn&#8217;t like the story you could still enjoy what they did. Also Jennifer Foreman was great as the babysitter and it was great seeing her again, she was also in another After Dark film called &#8220;Seconds Apart&#8221;. She looks just like a girl that used to &#8220;live&#8221; with me and the character acts just like her, so that was kinda cool to see.Over all I think that this was a pretty good film that does what it was meant to do. Soter did a good job here and I am looking forward to seeing if he ever enters the &#8220;horror&#8221; realm again. If he does I will be checking it out. Of course I will own anything Broken Lizard does so I will be seeing him again, hopefully we get that &#8220;Super Troopers 2&#8221;.",4,BROKEN LIZARD HORROR,1391644800,"02 6, 2014",2014,2567,"['DARK', 'CIRCLESI', 'have', 'bought', 'Dark', 'film', 'have', 'released', '8220', 'Fest', '8221', '8220', 'Originals', '8221', 'have', 'Imagine', 'surprise', 'when', 'found', 'out', 'Dark', 'film', 'was', 'written', 'directed', 'member', 'comedy', 'team', '8220', 'Broken', 'Lizard', '8221', 'who', 'might', 'know', '8220', 'Super', 'Troopers', '8221', 'such', 'wasn', '8217', 'expecting', 'once', 'learned', 'truly', 'didn', '8217', 'know', 'what', 'expect', 'out', 'was', 'really', 'good', 'film', 'ending', 'was', 'great.A', 'couple', 'newborn', 'baby', 'trying', 'find', 'perfect', 'place', 'watch', 'child', 'grow', 'decide', 'city', 'life', 'longer', 'new', 'addition', 'family', 'When', 'finally', 'deciding', 'house', 'country', 'settle', 'look', 'forward', 'new', 'life', 'together', 'being', 'parents', 'lot', 'harder', 'thought', 'would', 'be', 'sleepless', 'nights', 'baby', 'needing', 'constant', 'attention', 'go', 'sleep', 'so', 'long', 'start', 'seeing', 'things', 'are', 'not', 'there', 'are', 'they.Writer/director', 'Paul', 'Soter', 'Broken', 'Lizard', 'fame', 'great', 'job', 'film', 'letting', 'things', 'build', 'slowly', 'instead', 'forcing', 'things', 'most', 'horror', 'films', 'do', 'nowadays', 'good', 'job', 'letting', 'tension', 'build', 'things', 'getting', 'boring', 'tricky', 'films', 'was', 'cool', 'learn', 'film', 'was', 'based', 'things', 'happened', 'wife', 'just', 'one', 'many', 'things', 'learn', 'listening', 'commentary', 'DVD.Acting', 'wise', 'high', 'spot', 'film', 'stars', 'Johnathon', 'Schaech', 'Pell', 'James', 'did', 'great', 'here', 'were', 'very', 'believable', 'portrayals', 'couple', 'who', 'go', 'loving', 'excited', 'tied', 'beat', 'scared', 'paranoid', 'really', 'carry', 'film', 'strong', 'performances', 'fact', 'believe', 'even', 'didn', '8217', 'story', 'could', 'still', 'enjoy', 'what', 'did', 'Also', 'Jennifer', 'Foreman', 'was', 'great', 'babysitter', 'was', 'great', 'seeing', 'again', 'was', 'also', 'Dark', 'film', 'called', '8220', 'Seconds', 'Apart', '8221', 'just', 'girl', 'used', '8220', '8221', 'character', 'just', 'was', 'kinda', 'cool', 'see.Over', 'think', 'was', 'pretty', 'good', 'film', 'what', 'was', 'meant', 'do', 'Soter', 'did', 'good', 'job', 'here', 'am', 'looking', 'forward', 'seeing', 'ever', '8220', 'horror', '8221', 'realm', 'again', 'will', 'be', 'checking', 'out', 'course', 'will', 'own', 'anything', 'Broken', 'Lizard', 'so', 'will', 'be', 'seeing', 'again', 'hopefully', 'get', '8220', 'Super', 'Troopers', '2', '8221']",After Dark Originals: Dark Circles

This holds true with it's latest offering DARK CIRCLES.Alex and Penny are a young couple with a new baby who decide to move out to the suburbs instead of live in the hustle and bustle of the city. Thinking this is a better way to raise a child of course we viewers know that nothing of the kind can take place and of course the child and family will soon be placed into jeopardy.The new child is not the best at behaving and seems determined to keep the two of them awake most of the time. Why they can't figure out that they could sleep alternating shifts until the child develops a better sleep pattern is ignored so that we can have them suffer sleep deprivation. This is especially odd since Alex is a musician who works from home trying to compose music. Then again a new house is being built next door by a crew that seems to think they get paid more if they make more noise. With each passing day things seem to get worse.Eventually things reach and extreme and the pair both begin seeing a strange looking woman in and around the house. Could this be some spectral image that they are seeing or is it just a hallucination due to their sleep deprivation? Time will tell as the movie glides along at a snails pace feeling more like it is repeating scenes rather than offer a coherent plot line.These characters don't seem to make the best of decisions from start to finish. One that especially seemed odd to me was that they do their best to be loving, caring parents. But as the grind gets to them Alex meets a young girl working a check out counter at the local grocery and asks her to come baby sit for them. Call me crazy but I never once considered having some teenager I just met working the local grocery counter become the person I trusted with my child. Stranger yet is when they come home and she's no longer there they don't seem as upset as I would have been.The final solution to the story here is actually fairly decent but the time it took to get there was wasted.

Paul Soter's script attempts to flesh out the characters of Alex and Penny but never fully succeeds in establishing a credible foundation for their erratic behavior or their failure to cope with or address solutions to their deprivation---like moving the baby into their room to see why little Tanner cries all night?Johnathon Schaech and Pell James have good moments but the script hampers fully realized performances.Overall, an okay thriller worth a weeknight rental.",3,TRY SOMINEX NEXT TIME,1369612800,"05 27, 2013",2013,986,"['couple', 'year', 'absence', 'Dark', 'Originals', 'back', 'DARK', 'CIRCLES', 'ADOs', 'are', 'indie', 'forays', 'horror', 'have', 'been', 'very', 'good', 'HUSK', 'others', 'not', 'so', 'good', 'SCREAM', 'THE', 'BANSHEE', '.DARK', 'CIRCLES', 'pondering', 'occasionally', 'eerie', 'spookfest', 'centering', 'young', 'couple', 'newborn', 'son', 'who', 'move', 'rural', 'home', 'encounter', 'disturbing', 'occurrences', 'lead', 'question', 'other', 'sanity', 'only', 'thing', 'new', 'tale', 'ominous', 'presence', 'sleep', 'deprivation', 'causative', 'factor', 'Paul', 'Soter', 'script', 'attempts', 'flesh', 'out', 'characters', 'Alex', 'Penny', 'never', 'fully', 'establishing', 'credible', 'foundation', 'erratic', 'behavior', 'failure', 'cope', 'address', 'solutions', 'deprivation', 'moving', 'baby', 'room', 'see', 'why', 'little', 'Tanner', 'cries', 'night', 'Johnathon', 'Schaech', 'Pell', 'James', 'have', 'good', 'moments', 'script', 'hampers', 'fully', 'realized', 'performances.Overall', 'okay', 'thriller', 'weeknight', 'rental']",After Dark Originals: Dark Circles

They are under stress as any new parents, plus there is construction going on nearby which makes daytime rest impossible. The film boasts a very good suspense and creep factor as a phantom woman (Lucresha Wells) appears to haunt them. Both of them have seen her and believe she doesn't exist. Their relationship becomes increasingly strained.The acting and creep factor was done well. I really got into the film, but it seemed to go nowhere. You know everything seems to center around ""the woman"", but the film leaves you hanging about her until the very end, and then you say, ""That's it?""

He's a struggling jazz pianist, she's a former professional something-or-other but now stay-at-home mother; neither seem to be working much and yet they buy a big, new home in the country and sit around all day being driven steadily insane by construction workers, each other and a newborn that wakes up every 15 minutes screaming.  Oh, and there's also a creepy chick in desperate need of dental work lurking about which of course makes a bad situation even more difficult not to mention that visitors have a nasty habit of dying.I guess for me the overarching story was just way too depressing to simply enjoy the horror and again, the main characters are completely unsympathetic as they sit around stewing in paranoid, delusional fantasies all the while tearing at each other so that by the ending I really couldn't share in their triumph.  :o)",2,Honey... the crazy woman's under the sink again!,1393632000,"03 1, 2014",2014,1013,"['get-go', 'film', 'fair', 'amount', 'legitimately', 'creepy', 'moments', 'unfortunately', 'central', 'characters', 'are', 'just', 'so', 'darn', 'unlikeable', 'struggling', 'jazz', 'pianist', 'former', 'professional', 'something-or-other', 'now', 'stay-at-home', 'mother', 'seem', 'be', 'working', 'much', 'yet', 'buy', 'big', 'new', 'home', 'country', 'sit', 'day', 'being', 'driven', 'steadily', 'insane', 'construction', 'workers', 'other', 'newborn', 'up', '15', 'minutes', 'screaming', 'Oh', 'also', 'creepy', 'chick', 'desperate', 'need', 'dental', 'work', 'lurking', 'course', 'bad', 'situation', 'even', 'more', 'difficult', 'not', 'mention', 'visitors', 'have', 'nasty', 'habit', 'dying.I', 'guess', 'overarching', 'story', 'was', 'just', 'way', 'too', 'depressing', 'simply', 'enjoy', 'horror', 'again', 'main', 'characters', 'are', 'completely', 'unsympathetic', 'sit', 'around', 'stewing', 'paranoid', 'delusional', 'fantasies', 'while', 'tearing', 'other', 'ending', 'really', 'could', ""n't"", 'share', 'triumph', 'o']",After Dark Originals: Dark Circles
