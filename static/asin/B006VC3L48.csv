Once he locks on to something he obsesses over it and  there is no letteing up until he gets what he is looking for.  Often I have to turn the table and realize that his request may be rediculous to me, but it is inortant to him.  His wants and needs sometime break the bank, But I do the best I can,  I recentky learned that Amazon is a pretty much one stop shopping. Over all I give this transaction 5 STARS for a job well done.
