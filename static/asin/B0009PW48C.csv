It looks like the whole thing was shot on somebody's battered super 8 camera, stomped on and then filmed through a cup of pee.  It has zero suspense, zero character and plot development and is a blatant and terrible rip-off of ""Psycho"" and ""Texas Chain Saw"".

I started watching it and instantly, I started seeing this movie was almost a shot-for-shot rip off of Psycho. It starts off in a motel room with a couple finishing up having sex. They go into a house where the sympathetic guy's father (mother) wants him to get the harlots out. He makes them 'sandwiches and milk' for dinner. One, even though it's a bath instead of a shower, still gets stabbed to death in a tub. I could go on and on. I'm sorry. This movie was trash, stolen from a snazzy horror classic and as far as I'm concerned, is not worth wasting time. If you're in the mood of a horror film about Ed Gein, stick with Psycho and Texas Chainsaw Massacre (1974 and 2003).",1,COULD THIS BE ANY MORE OF A PSYCHO RIP-OFF?,1364860800,"04 2, 2013",2013,841,"['started', 'watching', 'movie', 'years', 'hearing', 'parents', 'other', 'people', 'who', 'told', 'would', 'like', 'love', 'Texas', 'Chainsaw', 'Massacre', 'started', 'watching', 'instantly', 'started', 'seeing', 'movie', 'was', 'almost', 'shot-for-shot', 'rip', 'Psycho', 'off', 'motel', 'room', 'couple', 'finishing', 'up', 'having', 'sex', 'go', 'house', 'where', 'sympathetic', 'guy', 'father', 'mother', 'get', 'harlots', 'out', ""'sandwiches"", 'milk', 'dinner', 'One', 'even', 'bath', 'instead', 'shower', 'still', 'stabbed', 'death', 'tub', 'could', 'go', ""'m"", 'sorry', 'movie', 'was', 'trash', 'stolen', 'snazzy', 'horror', 'classic', 'as', 'far', ""'m"", 'concerned', 'not', 'worth', 'wasting', 'time', ""'re"", 'mood', 'horror', 'film', 'Ed', 'Gein', 'stick', 'Psycho', 'Texas', 'Chainsaw', 'Massacre', '1974', '2003']",N/A
910808,A1DURK17MGKBEB,B0009PW48C,Ben Wasden,"[2, 2]","Three On A Meathook is yet another horror movie based on real life serial killer Ed Gein. And it's not one of the best. It lacks the expert direction that Alfred Hitchcock brought to Psycho, and it lacks crazed horror of The Texas Chainsaw Massacre. What Three On A Meathook is, is a fairly disjointed slasher film. Both the acting and direction are spotty overall. The only actor that is any good really is the man who played Billy. I will say that the first twenty minutes and the last ten minutes of Three On A Meathook are pretty good, but everything in between is boring and hard to sit through. I'd avoid if I were you, unless you're like me and have seen all of the good slashers out there.",2,Didn't Quite Hook Me,1295654400,"01 22, 2011",2011,697,"['Three', 'Meathook', 'yet', 'horror', 'movie', 'based', 'real', 'life', 'serial', 'killer', 'Ed', 'Gein', 'not', 'one', 'best', 'expert', 'direction', 'Alfred', 'Hitchcock', 'brought', 'Psycho', 'crazed', 'horror', 'Texas', 'Chainsaw', 'Massacre', 'What', 'Three', 'A', 'Meathook', 'fairly', 'disjointed', 'slasher', 'film', 'acting', 'direction', 'are', 'spotty', 'overall', 'only', 'actor', 'good', 'really', 'man', 'who', 'played', 'Billy', 'will', 'say', 'first', 'twenty', 'minutes', 'last', 'ten', 'minutes', 'Three', 'A', 'Meathook', 'are', 'pretty', 'good', 'everything', 'boring', 'hard', 'sit', ""'d"", 'avoid', 'were', ""'re"", 'have', 'seen', 'good', 'slashers', 'there']",N/A
910809,AIMR915K4YCN,B0009PW48C,"Bindy Sue Frnknschtein ""bigfootsalienbaby""","[0, 0]","I like some of Director, William Girdler's films, especially GRIZZLY and DAY OF THE ANIMALS. THREE ON A MEATHOOK has nothing to do w/ killer wildlife. It opens w/ four young women stranded in the middle of nowhere, after their car breaks down. They're offered a ride, and a place to stay the night w/ a seemingly kind young man, named Billy. Upon arrival at his rural home, things appear normal enough. Billy lives w/ his dad, who seems a bit upset about the girls' presence. The women soon find themselves in a nightmare of madness and blood-soaked death! MEATHOOK's first 20 minutes contain a stabbing, a decapitation, and two deaths-by-shotgun-blast. Billy, blamed for the murders by his father, sets out on a long and rather dull walk downtown, where he's treated to groovy music from a band that looks like a pre-disco BEE GEES, and sounds like an unholy union of CHICAGO and THREE DOG NIGHT! Billy drinks a lot, passes out, and wakes up in some woman's bed. I'll take this opportunity to say, yes, this movie has a bit of nudity! Anyway, Billy invites the woman back to his house for the coming weekend! She accepts! And is bringing a friend!! Dear god, wasn't she the least bit leery of his gargantuan sideburns? Time passes slooowwllly as we watch Billy and dad eat, argue, and pray together. Finally, the girls arrive. Billy takes them on an extended tour of the farm. I swear I actually saw the grass grow! Now, their wading through the cornfield, spouting philosophical musings as they go. I'm starting to wonder about that meathook about now. Back in the house, dad's bombed, staggering around. Meanwhile, the girls discuss reincarnation, love, and girl-scout camp. Dinner ensues. What was this movie about again? Uh-oh! Time for bed. Here we go! Pitchfork to the gut! One girl remains. Will she survive this hellish ordeal? At last, the title comes into play. THE END. TOAM is sort of the buck-toothed, cross-eyed child of PSYCHO and THE TEXAS CHAINSAW MASSACRE.

910810,A3UAIEHXTUT85G,B0009PW48C,"S. Boone ""TheatreX""","[7, 7]","Three on a Meathook is the first effort from local boy William Girdler (local being here in Louisville, KY).  If you're a fan it's probably worthwhile to have but if you're not you may want to take a pass on this.  It's kind of questionable as far as quality goes, as in, the box says it's digitally remastered but I have to wonder about that.  Still though it's got its moments, although there are long periods of inaction where folks romp through corn & a groovy 70's band plays wah-wah music, with a horn section, no less....Girdler sure like wah-wah guitar (see Asylum of Satan for more evidence).  Anyway this is supposedly based on the kind efforts on one Ed Gein,  and the prey is always lovely young ladies.  I always knew there's a good reason for not wandering too far beyond the city limits of Louisville.  Special effects by G. ""Pat"" Patterson, & a main role by Girdler regular Charles Kissinger.  This is not excruciating except to the uninitiated, perhaps, but it's not great either but if you like other William Girdler works this is worth having in your collection.  3 out of 5 stars.",3,"William Girdler's first effort, definitely not his best",1132617600,"11 22, 2005",2005,1100,"['Three', 'Meathook', 'first', 'effort', 'local', 'boy', 'William', 'Girdler', 'local', 'being', 'here', 'Louisville', 'KY', ""'re"", 'fan', 'probably', 'worthwhile', 'have', ""'re"", 'not', 'may', 'want', 'take', 'pass', 'kind', 'questionable', 'as', 'far', 'quality', 'box', 'digitally', 'remastered', 'have', 'wonder', 'Still', 'got', 'moments', 'are', 'long', 'periods', 'inaction', 'where', 'folks', 'romp', 'corn', 'groovy', '70', 'band', 'wah-wah', 'music', 'horn', 'section', 'less', '.Girdler', 'sure', 'wah-wah', 'guitar', 'see', 'Asylum', 'Satan', 'more', 'evidence', 'Anyway', 'supposedly', 'based', 'kind', 'efforts', 'one', 'Ed', 'Gein', 'prey', 'always', 'lovely', 'young', 'ladies', 'always', 'knew', 'good', 'reason', 'not', 'wandering', 'too', 'far', 'city', 'limits', 'Louisville', 'Special', 'effects', 'G.', 'Pat', 'Patterson', 'main', 'role', 'Girdler', 'regular', 'Charles', 'Kissinger', 'not', 'excruciating', 'uninitiated', 'perhaps', 'not', 'great', 'like', 'other', 'William', 'Girdler', 'worth', 'having', 'collection', '3', '5', 'stars']",N/A

I had my hopes up that this obscure film might be worth my time. They were quickly dashed however when the film degenerated into an overly talky, meandering story of ""boy meets girl"". Nothing happens during the middle hour of the film. Then there is more killing and a completly out of nowhere ending quickly wrapped up with a ""psychological"" explanation by a mental health doctor. Clearly the screenwriter had recently watched ""Psycho"" and decided to use that films most unnecessary scene to also wrap up his movie. The DVD is obviously taken from a battered VHS print, complete with visible tracking problems on the bottom and a constant pink line on the right side of the screen. The colors are washed out and the picture quality is very poor. I could possibly forgive all this due to the obscurity of the film were it any good, its not, so I won't.
