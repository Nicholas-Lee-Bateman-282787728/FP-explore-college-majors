1335113,AIB1J75JT2MGI,B003AWEZ74,"Bruce Nichols ""Coffeeman""","[5, 17]","This movie should have been given another title. There's little in the film about producing good art & copy. I expected to see passionate copywriters and art directors working on ads. I hoped to see some in depth reporting on the current trends in advertising such as advertising on the web. How about explaining techniques on how to get the attention of target audiences when there's so much competition for his attention?In this film, there is little, if any, new information on the production of advertising, what the industry is like today and where it's heading. Instead, the film devotes much of its time to established stars in the industry who describe in detail successful campaigns they did 20 or 30 years ago. They go on saying that the 80's was a golden age for Advertising and how the work being produced today (along with the climate in ad agencies) is just awful. The advertising medium that the film opens and closes with is the billboard. The images of workers changing billboard ads tell you that this is not a film about cutting-edge 21st century advertising, but rather a film about conventional advertising techniques instead.Listening to these guys go on about past victories nearly put me to sleep in the first hour of the film - a big irony since advertising is supposed to have the opposite effect. Watch it if you must, but don't expect to learn much about today's advertising. People entering the industry might benefit by seeing what kind of egomaniac their future boss might be.",2,Talking Heads Saying Nothing New,1284681600,"09 17, 2010",2010,1507,"['movie', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'given', 'title', 'little', 'film', 'producing', 'good', 'art', 'copy', 'expected', 'see', 'passionate', 'copywriters', 'art', 'directors', 'working', 'ads', 'hoped', 'see', 'depth', 'reporting', 'current', 'trends', 'advertising', 'such', 'advertising', 'web', 'How', 'explaining', 'techniques', 'how', 'get', 'attention', 'target', 'audiences', 'when', 'so', 'much', 'competition', 'attention', 'film', 'little', 'new', 'information', 'production', 'advertising', 'what', 'industry', 'today', 'where', 'heading', 'Instead', 'film', 'much', 'time', 'established', 'stars', 'industry', 'who', 'detail', 'successful', 'campaigns', 'did', '20', '30', 'years', 'ago', 'go', 'saying', '80', 'was', 'golden', 'age', 'Advertising', 'how', 'work', 'being', 'produced', 'today', 'climate', 'ad', 'agencies', 'just', 'awful', 'advertising', 'medium', 'film', 'opens', 'closes', 'billboard', 'images', 'workers', 'changing', 'billboard', 'ads', 'tell', 'not', 'film', 'cutting-edge', '21st', 'century', 'advertising', 'rather', 'film', 'conventional', 'advertising', 'techniques', 'instead.Listening', 'guys', 'go', 'past', 'victories', 'nearly', 'put', 'sleep', 'first', 'hour', 'film', 'big', 'irony', 'advertising', 'supposed', 'have', 'opposite', 'effect', 'Watch', 'must', 'do', ""n't"", 'expect', 'learn', 'much', 'today', 'advertising', 'People', 'entering', 'industry', 'might', 'benefit', 'seeing', 'what', 'kind', 'egomaniac', 'future', 'boss', 'might', 'be']",Art & Copy: Inside Advertising's Creative Revolution
1335114,A2QZQBINBG6B5N,B003AWEZ74,Charles S. Houser,"[3, 3]","This is a very slick and beautiful documentary--as you might expect considering the subject matter. And it really is about the era (the mid-60s) depicted in the hit TV show Mad Men. And like the TV series, it's part love montage, part cautionary tale. The seductive part is the array of kookie and iconoclastic (and sometimes downright potty-mouthed) creatives who reminisce about some of the all-time most memorable ad campaigns they worked on. Nike's ""Just do it"" slogan, we're told, comes from Gary Gillmore's last words to his executioners. ""Where's the beef?"" was almost rejected by the client. (These real-life creatives can make Don Draper look downright deferential. No shortage of self-confidence here.) My favorite ad person was Mary Wells, the mastermind behind the Braniff airlines make-over. Trained as an actress, she felt a need to bring theater to the business of selling. For Braniff she redesigned the planes before even beginning work on the ads. And she wrangled Pucci into designing uniforms for the flight attendants (called stewardesses in the ads), complete with space bubble helmets! The cautionary elements of the film are more subtle. They consist of statistics displayed on the screen announcing the obscene amounts of money spent on advertizing, the number or ads the average unsuspecting citizen is exposed to daily, etc. In the end, it's a little sad (and scary) just how aspirational we consumers are. And how desperately we want to be sold something--anything--that will make us okay, complete.

Along the way you see how boardroom politics interact with art and often nearly prevent brilliant ideas from coming to life.  I render scientific graphics for a living so I got this for ideas about what makes a great visual and it gave me what I wanted but also made me realize how we are swimming in awful marketing campaigns.

1335117,ASEBX8TBYWQWA,B003AWEZ74,"Steven I. Ramm ""Steve Ramm &#34;Anything Phon...","[1, 7]","With the success of the cable TV show Mad Men which centers around advertising agencies in the 1950s, there's a new interest in commercial ads. This PBS documentary tries to jump on the bandwagon and is fairly interesting. But like one of the six or eight ad execs who fill much of the screen time says : (I'm paraphrasing here) Why produce something ordinary when you can produce something GREAT? Modern agencies have figured out how to tell a story of a product in under 30 seconds, yet Director Doug Pray takes 89 minutes to tell a store he could have easily done in under an hour. Even with including snippets of lots of successful commercials  (the  1984 Apple Super Bowl commercial is one of the few shown in their entirety) its way too long. And there's lots of new computer generated graphics and photos of the exec's workspaces that really ad nothing but time.The top names in the field (George Lois - the most honest and entertaining- Mary Wells, David Kennedy) are hear but you won't know who they are until you watch the bonus interviews. Why? Because their names and affiliations are shown in white on a lighy gray background that is virtually impossible to read.Some print ads are shown and there are scenes of billboards being mounted. But wouldn't it have been interesting to learn something about the billboard business too? Or just leave out those scenes. There's just a lot of FILLER here and that's something good commercials - or good documentaries shouldn't have.If you really want to know more about the advertising business, this DVD might help you some, but it may also put you to sleep a few times.Steve Ramm""Anything Phonographic""",3,A visual history of print and TV advertising - that sometimes actually gets boring,1272844800,"05 3, 2010",2010,1657,"['success', 'cable', 'TV', 'show', 'Mad', 'Men', 'advertising', 'agencies', '1950s', 'new', 'interest', 'commercial', 'ads', 'PBS', 'documentary', 'tries', 'jump', 'bandwagon', 'fairly', 'interesting', 'one', 'six', 'eight', 'ad', 'execs', 'who', 'fill', 'much', 'screen', 'time', ""'m"", 'paraphrasing', 'here', 'Why', 'produce', 'something', 'ordinary', 'when', 'can', 'produce', 'something', 'GREAT', 'Modern', 'agencies', 'have', 'figured', 'out', 'how', 'tell', 'story', 'product', '30', 'seconds', 'yet', 'Director', 'Doug', 'Pray', '89', 'minutes', 'tell', 'store', 'could', 'have', 'easily', 'done', 'hour', 'Even', 'including', 'snippets', 'lots', 'successful', 'commercials', '1984', 'Apple', 'Super', 'Bowl', 'commercial', 'one', 'few', 'shown', 'entirety', 'way', 'too', 'long', 'lots', 'new', 'computer', 'generated', 'graphics', 'photos', 'exec', 'workspaces', 'really', 'ad', 'nothing', 'time.The', 'top', 'names', 'field', 'George', 'Lois', 'most', 'honest', 'entertaining-', 'Mary', 'Wells', 'David', 'Kennedy', 'are', 'hear', 'wo', ""n't"", 'know', 'who', 'are', 'watch', 'bonus', 'interviews', 'Why', 'names', 'affiliations', 'are', 'shown', 'white', 'lighy', 'gray', 'background', 'virtually', 'impossible', 'read.Some', 'print', 'ads', 'are', 'shown', 'are', 'scenes', 'billboards', 'being', 'mounted', 'would', ""n't"", 'have', 'been', 'interesting', 'learn', 'something', 'billboard', 'business', 'too', 'just', 'leave', 'out', 'scenes', 'just', 'lot', 'FILLER', 'here', 'something', 'good', 'commercials', 'good', 'documentaries', 'should', ""n't"", 'have.If', 'really', 'want', 'know', 'more', 'advertising', 'business', 'DVD', 'might', 'help', 'may', 'also', 'put', 'sleep', 'few', 'times.Steve', 'Ramm', 'Anything', 'Phonographic']",Art & Copy: Inside Advertising's Creative Revolution
1335118,A4UKBG3M5U5TI,B003AWEZ74,Westley,"[9, 11]","""Art & Copy"" is a documentary about the advertising business that focuses on the icons who started in the 1960s and developed memorable ads throughout the next several decades.  These admen (and they are mostly men) present the stories behind some huge campaigns, including ""Got Milk?,"" Nike's ""Just do it,"" and Apple's ""1984,"" many of which were listed in Ad Age's top 100 ads.  Interspersed through the film are the commercials and ads being discussed, various factoids about the business, and a few interviews with regular people, such as a worker who sets up billboards.I don't have any inherent interest in advertising, although I do tend to like documentaries of people talking about their jobs.  The behind-the-scenes peak at this creative process and some of the stories are definitely interesting.  As such, ""Art & Copy"" held my attention and was well produced and attractive.  However, after it ended, I didn't feel as though I had any new insight into the business.  I also noticed that mention of the effectiveness of the ads was mostly avoided, and no one discussed their unsuccessful campaigns (In fact, one adman proudly stated that he never thinks about his failures because once you do, then you become afraid).  Thus, at times, it felt a tad like an advertisement for the advertising business.
