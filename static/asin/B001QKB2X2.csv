1230942,A2B4GW5A7RUQU7,B001QKB2X2,B,"[5, 7]","UPDATE: I've received my Deluxe Edition and am very pleased with it. Each disk contains 7 or so episodes and the 'Play All' option which makes it really convenient to plop down for a few hours of viewing without having to move much :pThe lack of other languages is a negative, but not enough to cost a star in my review. I think there must have been some issues with obtaining the French dialogue or something. The series was not released here in Canada which is odd for a North American release and I assume it has something to do with the lack of French dialogue since everything here is obliged to be bilingual.I didn't notice an option to watch the series without the mini documentaries after each episode, but I don't mind since the docs are so 80's cool.The post cards are super cute but not overly special and the poster, while pretty, is permanently marred by folding creases. Oh well. Bonus booklet is very nice.Overall, I couldn't be happier with the series and it's quality for this deluxe release. I plan on ordering the standard edition for all of the children and families in my life. *end update*This is an amazing show. Its clever, beautiful, funny, full of adventure and discovery... And you learn real life things in every episode (or after, during the wonderfully 80's mini documentaries). This will be the show I raise my children on, not that ADD causing waste of time bologna they push on innocent young minds today. Thank you for FINALLY making this show available in North America! I recommend it to anyone and everyone, but especially children, it will really capture their imaginations - if they aren't too warped already by a lot of modern pop culture garbage.",5,Best Cartoon Ever.

1230943,A3BTL4FV6ODKAT,B001QKB2X2,"fredtownward ""The Analytical Mind; Have Brain...","[4, 4]","Frankly, I'd argue that this is one of the best adventure serials ever made, period, but at the very least it is unquestionably the best paced.  I love adventure serials, but one of my pet peeves with the format is the all too common poor pacing, especially in quest serials.  What I mean by that is that you only need to watch the first episode or two, the last episode or two, and occasionally one or two critical episodes in between in order to know the whole story, to see all the mysteries resolved.  Most of the episodes, however well written, are filler or red herrings that are not important to the telling of the main story.In contrast not a single episode in this serial is wasted.  Every episode sees an important clue discovered or deciphered, an important lock unlocked, an important tool acquired or learned more about, an important piece of knowledge obtained, an important ally won or a dangerous enemy thwarted, a significant character development or team building exercise, or at the very least, significant physical progress being made on a journey stretching from Barcelona to the land of the Incas to the Amazon jungle to the land of the Mayas.  Even the interlude among the Amazons, arguably the least important to advancing the main storyline, results in them figuring out how to power up a vital tool when it gets shielded from the Sun by the jungle canopy and discovering and deciphering the purpose of another example of advanced Hivan technology.It is the 16th Century, and everyone it seems is looking for the mysterious cities of gold.  Unsatisfied with the wealth he has stolen from the Incas, Francisco Pizarro is seeking them, and he even has an important clue, the Golden Quipu, which supposedly reveals their location.  Unfortunately he hasn't yet been able to, uh, ""persuade"" any Incas to decipher it for him.  However, for some reason (perhaps because he finally realized who her father was) he now believes that the Inca girl he once gave as a ""pet savage"" to the Spanish royal family can read it and can be more easily ""persuaded"" to read it than an adult.  So he has secretly sent Senior Gomez and Captain Perez of the Esperanza back to Barcelona to retrieve the now 11-year-old Zia.  Explanations would take time and might not be persuasive so they have decided just to kidnap her.  However, sneaking into the royal palace is not something a prudent man does when he can hire a reckless man to do it for him, and as everyone knows, Mendoza, the navigator, ""will do anything for gold.""  No need to tell him the real reason, though.But Mendoza already knows.  If he didn't know before, he knew as soon as he saw the medallion of the Sun Zia wears.  He found an identical medallion around the neck of the baby boy he saved by insanely swimming to the rescue from Magellan's round-the-world expedition at the height of a Pacific storm over a decade earlier.  He stole the Sun part of that medallion at the time and has since come to believe it is connected with the cities of gold.  In Barcelona Mendoza runs into that boy now 12 who hears the same story from his foster father on his deathbed, and Mendoza after producing the stolen medallion in order to establish his bona fides, offers to sneak the boy onboard the Esperanza and take him to the New World in search of adventure, his possibly still living father, and perhaps even the cities of gold.  With no remaining ties to Spain, Esteban agrees, hoping to find his father or at least learn who and what he is.  In the hold of the Esperanza the two children discover each other, become fast friends, and realize that their identical medallions arguably somehow link their origins and probably link their fates.That's just the first episode.  After this things start to get complicated.One of the best parts about this serial is the intricate character interactions.  True, everybody is searching for the same cities of gold but for widely differing stated reasons with widely differing true motives and with widely differing extremes they are willing to go to in order to get what they want.  Amongst an army (or several) of brutal treasure hunters, Mendoza stands out for his refusal to harm the children in the apparent belief that if he follows them around long enough and helps them out long enough, eventually they will come to trust him...or at least let something important slip.  Esteban, who grew up Spanish and owes both his life and the opportunity to tag along to him, tolerates Mendoza more than Zia, who'd gladly never see another Spaniard for the rest of her life, but even she gradually realizes that there is merit in a person who insists on keeping you alive and unharmed even if it is for all the wrong reasons, in hopes that you will eventually become useful to him.  It is all fine and dandy to dismiss Mendoza's help amongst Incans who treat you like a national hero, but amongst other ""peoples"" who would sacrifice you to their gods or dismember you in order to harvest your young and healthy cells, a competently treacherous Spaniard and his two loyal imbeciles (loyal precisely because they realize they ARE imbeciles who'd stand no chance on their own) make a nice ace in the hole.  (Mendoza's treachery tour de force, which involves switching sides twice in a single episode, has to be seen to be believed, including the climax when Esteban schools the teacher.)  A lot of fun is also had with the differing approaches to problem solving between Tao, a 13-year-old Hivan boy who joins up later and Esteban.  A scholar and an inventor, Tao prefers to carefully plan his moves when lives are on the line while Esteban is inclined to trust to luck and just wing it.  This leads to a great deal of trouble between the two, especially when Esteban's recklessness succeeds beyond all reason!Only VERY loosely based upon Scott O'Dell's second novelThe King's Fifth, this serial significantly alters that novel's premise by tossing into the mix all of the wildest and most radical theories regarding the mysteries of pre-Columbian South and Central America, including lost civilizations, highly advanced technology, and the lost continent of Mu (Hiva).  Watching this series when it was first shown on Nickelodeon even lead me to purchase and read the then newLost Cities and Ancient Mysteries of South America (Lost Cities Series), and I was astonished to learn how much of this serial was based upon existing theories.  I contacted the Illinois-based author, one thing lead to another, and we ended up meeting and exchanging copies of videotapes, for my part receiving my first look at the somewhat overwrought but nevertheless amazing movieMacKenna's Gold, based upon the famousLost Dutchman Mine.Defects?  Only the occasional nitpick.  English subtitles would have been nice as would the French and Japanese soundtracks with their own English subtitles for comparison.  (I'm curious to know what changes were made now that I know some changes WERE made.)  A musical soundtrack CD would have been another nice to have since the original soundtrack album is long gone and out of print.One of the nice things about these DVD's for fans who only watched the show on Nickelodeon is that the missing live action documentary segments have been restored.  These short educational features, included because the series was targetted at public education TV channels, often explained the facts or in some cases the theories behind the plot devices used in that episode: the Nazca lines, the lost continent of Mu (Hiva in this show), the Amazons, etc.  Fittingly, the documentary segment on the last episode ends with the mysterious disappearance in 1925 of renowned British explorer Col. Percy Harrison Fawcett who vanished while seeking to findThe Lost City of Z.Note: Be sure and unfold and check out the poster that comes with the(DELUXE EDITION)but not until after you've watched the serial at least once.  Why?  Because on the back of the poster is a map of the whole expedition, including the named locations of all the important places.  It should clear up some mysteries, like the true location of Pizarro's Fort.Among the extras included on the DVD's, the most interesting to me was the interview with co-creator Jean Chalopin, which revealed among other things that these 39 episodes were originally intended to be the first season of a seven year long serial that would have had the heroes seeking out each of the seven lost cities of gold all around the world.  The second year was to be set in Japan, the third in Indonesia, then on to Africa and mainland Asia, but the first series wasn't financially successful enough to attract enough funding.  Currently Mr. Chalopin is trying to get Hollywood interested in a movie version and use its (hoped for) success to get the remaining years of the series produced.Now THAT is something I would LOVE to

A unique show, a French-written, Japanese animated story about a young Spanish boy brought to the New World by a group of conquistadors trying to find El Dorado. It feels sort of like an Indiana Jones story set in the 1500's with mild science fiction elements.I'm happy and surprised at how well it holds up. The Spanish are portrayed as greedy and brutal, the Inca are portrayed in a sympathetic light. Tao, who looks like he would normally be the comedy relief is actually the smartest of the group, a descendant of the lost race of Hiva. The complicated feelings Esteban has for Mendoza (who is both a father-figure and a villain) is deeper than you would normally find in a kids show. I also appreciated that the children in the show were voiced by actual children, rather than adults. And the music is to die for.The discs have a few extras. Nothing outstanding. I wish the video had been remastered. A couple of the episodes were noticeably darker than the rest. But really, the fact that the show has been released on DVD at all is a miracle.

1230948,A2SO8REV9AUHTU,B001QKB2X2,M.K.,"[2, 3]","The Mysterious Cities of Gold, based loosely on Scott O'Dell's novel, ""The King's Fifth"", tells the tale of Esteban, an Incan girl Zia and Tao, the last descendant of his native Hiva race, in a race against time to find and protect the locations of the mystical and legendary Seven Cities of Gold from the likes and greeds of Gomez & Gaspard, Captain Pizarro and his Spanish army, Dr. Fernando LaGuerra, his beautiful advisor and powerhouse bodyguard, Marinche and Tetiola, and the unusual and cunning, 1000-year-old Olmec civilization.  Accompanying them on their adventures is the brave Spaniard Mendoza, and his loyal, but cowardly croonies, Pedro and Sancho.This anime masterpiece was brought together through the smart minds of both France and Japan, legendary producer Jean Chalopin (Heathcliff and Inspector Gadget) and the famous music collabo Haim Saban and Shuki Levy.The subplots all find their ways into the main conflicts, the anime is spectacular and the music is both catchy and breathtaking.  For a little trivia, a few pieces of the music scores (the danger suite and the anticipation theme) were featured in another cartoon, He-Man and the Masters of the Universe, a year later in 1984.Overall, I've been waiting for this show to be on DVD for a long time.  I'm amped to see the special features too.In conclusion, go get this.

1230951,A3NBL1LVUAGU2,B001QKB2X2,Poison Wood,"[2, 2]","Did you watch the Mysterious Cities of gold as a child?  I saw this cartoon series back in 1986 at the age of 6.  I loved in the first time as a kid, and I'm thoroughly enjoying re-watching the episodes as an adult.This cartoon was originally done in French, and was then dubbed in English by Canadian actors.  It's about three children, one Spanish, another Incan, and a third from a different South American tribe and their search with three Spaniards for the mysterious cities of gold.  It's fantastically entertaining, especially if you have any interest in South American history.If you have children and are looking for an educational cartoon, I think MCOG is an excellent choice.  I remember becoming interested in the Incas and in the Spanish led by Pizarro after watching this cartoon.  Each episode has an education segment afterwards.  Some of the segments seem a bit out of date and even inaccurate at times, but they will no doubt pique a child's interest to learn more.The extras that come with the series are stellar.

It was previously released on DVD in Quebec and France in the early 2000's and Japan a few years later. It is now set for a long overdue US release with excellent special features.I speculate that the success of bootleg copies of the series may have contributed to it finally being released on DVD in English speaking countries just like what happened with the series Sea Quest DSV.The series also includes a music soundtrack by Haim Saban and Shuki Levy recorded with synthesizers which is worthy of a Grammy and an Emmy. This soundtrack is better than most movie soundtracks and has been released on LP and CD over the decades.I am ecstatic about this release and will be buying both editions.
