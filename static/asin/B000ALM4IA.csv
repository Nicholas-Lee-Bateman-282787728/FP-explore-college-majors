To those that say it's biased and racist, you must have been asleep...because here's just one part of a narration, verbatim..""At a bend on the Big Sandy on November 29th 1864 over 100 Cheyenne, mostly women and children, were massacred by a United States military force commanded by the Indian-hating Col. John Shippington. Led by Black Kettle, these Indians were moving towards accommodation with Washington's desire to place all nomadic Indians on reservations where they would learn a sedentary lifestyle..""That does not sound racist or biased. It's what happened.Anyways, I am finding fascinating information, such as the ""Great Horse Dispersal""....something I knew very little of. And how it let to one of the most rapid diffusions of technology in human history. SO much I had to know more, which let me to more and more..This is a great PRIMER and eye-opener on AmerInd relations and the 40 year black-eye in American History we get glossed over in school by ""how the west was won"" and ""Gunsmoke"". The producers stuff a LOT of information into 235 minutes. Yes I understand that like any large body of work, there are some minor detail flaws but again, if you WANT to see it as something more than it is (racist, biased, etc) you undoubtedly will. If you view it with an open mind, you'll see just how badly we dealt with the Native Americans. And suffice it to say that the U.S isn't alone in that respect; Such things occurred in Australia and S. Africa...but those are subjects of another discussion. To me it does appear that  the producers went to great lengths to compile a LOT of data into  digestible pieces; however, as was said, the narrator tends to be a bit overdramatic and boring. And as another reviewer, it appears they want to try the Ken Burns' style but just don't quite get it. That's the only thing I can say in the negative. Otherwise I give it two thumbs up for the information within. If it piques your curiosity to learn more about the events, it's done it's job. I have not finished it, as now I'm into the War for the Northern Plains. Having lived in SE Arizona for 23 years, I am familiar with Geronimo and Cochise and Ft.

I picked this set up on a whim, due largely to its rock-bottom price and nicely constructed packaging.  And I must say, I've been pleasantly surprised.  No, the reenactments are not terribly high budget, but the invective elicited from other reviewers seems largely unmerited.No, the Native tribes are not depicted as sub-human savages, brutes or monsters.  But what seems to anger some people is that the Whites are not dehumanized either.  The documentaries take great pains to show the motivations, strengths, heroes, villains, foibles, massacres, and misunderstandings on both sides.  Both Whites and Natives attack civilians.  Both Whites and Native break treaties.  Both Whites and Natives attempt to learn from one another and to live in peace.  Both White and Natives engage in raiding, conquest, and slave trade.  Meanwhile, fair attention is paid to other players, such as the famous and hard-fighting Buffalo Soldiers.  Some seem aghast at the fact that this program points out roughly equal numbers of casualties on both sides in the Indian Wars, as if this robbed Native tribes of their victimhood.  I just saw it as evidence that the Natives were skilled, brave warriors, who were far more effective against the US military over the years than we are often led to believe.Previously, many narratives of the Indian Wars portrayed Euro-Americans as chivalrous and noble, while Natives were violent and untrustworthy.  In the last generation, that image has been turned on its head.  It seems that whenever a human society encounters another radically different culture, the only way that society can make sense of the other is to either deify them or to demonize them.  We can see strangers as angels or devils, but not as people.

This perhaps makes the title a bit deceptive.  This is mostly about the Western Tribes of the Great Plains and their early migrations and how they became horse peoples and their final stand against white encroachment in the late 1900s.  This is also primarily a Military History of the subject with a straight-forward account without any of the eulogizing often associated with this topic.  Attrocities were committed by both Red and White man and this series does not hold back.The first DVD deals in depth with the individual Western Tribes and how they settled and become Horse Peoples.  The 2nd deals with the advance of the US Cavalry out West and provides some good detail about Soldier life and how they adapted to fight the red man.  These battles were by no means one sided and attrocities were freely committed by both sides.There is a section about the great war chiefs and surprisingly little about Custer and Little Big Horn which may disappoint some.  For me I was glad that the focus was elsewhere as this chapter of the Indian wars is well covered.The 3rd DVD deals with the battle for the Northern Plains with all the famous Tribes associated with it.  The 4th DVD deals with the battle for the Southern Plains and Texas.  Less well known this information was quite detailed and interesting.Again, its too bad a 5th DVD could not have dealt with the Eastern Tribes more.  These and their conflicts are just summarized on the 2nd DVD which does give a good chronology of events.  I guess another DVD set would be required to do justice to the Indian wars of the Eastern Woodlands.This is a budget production, with a few minor tracking problems.  There are not a lot of nice graphics, and maps are sparsely used.  Narration is a bit stilted at times, but overall this is a great general reference item providing a good introductory look at the Indian Wars out West.",4,"""A Good Indian is a .....""",1308096000,"06 15, 2011",2011,1998,"['interesting', 'DVD', 'Documentry', 'overview', 'Plains', 'Wars', 'little', 'Indian', 'Wars', 'general', 'perhaps', 'title', 'bit', 'deceptive', 'mostly', 'Western', 'Tribes', 'Great', 'Plains', 'early', 'migrations', 'how', 'became', 'horse', 'peoples', 'final', 'stand', 'white', 'encroachment', 'late', '1900s', 'also', 'primarily', 'Military', 'History', 'subject', 'straight-forward', 'account', 'eulogizing', 'often', 'associated', 'topic', 'Attrocities', 'were', 'committed', 'Red', 'White', 'man', 'series', 'not', 'hold', 'back.The', 'first', 'DVD', 'deals', 'depth', 'individual', 'Western', 'Tribes', 'how', 'settled', 'become', 'Horse', 'Peoples', '2nd', 'deals', 'advance', 'US', 'Cavalry', 'West', 'good', 'detail', 'Soldier', 'life', 'how', 'adapted', 'fight', 'red', 'man', 'battles', 'were', 'means', 'one', 'sided', 'attrocities', 'were', 'freely', 'committed', 'section', 'great', 'war', 'chiefs', 'surprisingly', 'little', 'Custer', 'Little', 'Big', 'Horn', 'may', 'disappoint', 'was', 'glad', 'focus', 'was', 'elsewhere', 'chapter', 'Indian', 'wars', 'well', 'covered.The', '3rd', 'DVD', 'deals', 'battle', 'Northern', 'Plains', 'famous', 'Tribes', 'associated', '4th', 'DVD', 'deals', 'battle', 'Southern', 'Plains', 'Texas', 'Less', 'well', 'known', 'information', 'was', 'quite', 'detailed', 'interesting.Again', 'too', 'bad', '5th', 'DVD', 'could', 'not', 'have', 'dealt', 'Eastern', 'Tribes', 'more', 'conflicts', 'are', 'just', 'summarized', '2nd', 'DVD', 'give', 'good', 'chronology', 'events', 'guess', 'DVD', 'set', 'would', 'be', 'required', 'do', 'justice', 'Indian', 'wars', 'Eastern', 'Woodlands.This', 'budget', 'production', 'few', 'minor', 'tracking', 'problems', 'are', 'not', 'lot', 'nice', 'graphics', 'maps', 'are', 'sparsely', 'used', 'Narration', 'bit', 'stilted', 'times', 'overall', 'great', 'general', 'reference', 'item', 'providing', 'good', 'introductory', 'look', 'Indian', 'Wars', 'out', 'West']",The Great Indian Wars: 1540-1890

It noted atrocities, such as, torture and scalping that were done by both sides.  This disappoints those who prefer the cruel white invaders stomping on the noble red man stuff.  Those who say it is biased for the whites are really just disappointed that it wasn't biased for the indians.  The politically correct crowd, you know.It is not a high budget film, many still photographs are used.  However, the still photographs work well with the narration and actually give you time to study the places and faces of the people of that time in a way moving pictures can't. I assume those who complain about the use of still pictures are too young to remember that cameras in those days didn't take moving pictures.One of the things that struck me is the way the film pointed out bad and good on both sides.  I was surprised to read the reviews stating, in error, that the film is biased.  I would say to them, the ""Great Indian Wars"" are over, so get over it.  You are just as silly as those who can't get over the south losing the civil war.  If you think the country should be given back to the indians, write your congressman, senator or the president.  Maybe they will give it back.
