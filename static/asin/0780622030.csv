If you want to initiate them with a movie, start with &quot;Police Story&quot; (it worked with my wife). The reasons: 1) The action occurs in the actual time. While some Chan movies are better (like Drunken Master 2), the environment on those is the one that most people relate to the cheap karate flicks. 2) There are some great stunts -a trademark of Chan- as when he falls several floors in a department store, with only Christmas lights slowering the otherwise mortal fall. 3) Lots of great action 4) This is probably one of his funniest movies. If I described the scenes, they will not sound funny, because when it is physical humor, you have to watch it to appreciate it.The only minor flaw of the film is that the last half hour turns into an avenging film, with more drama than humor.

31097,A1TET60NZOM8HK,0780622030,A Reader,"[3, 4]","Jackie Chan demonstates in this film that not only is he a great martial artist and dare-devil, but also a great director and a good actor.  He wanted to prove that Hong Kong could produce movies as good or better than Hollywood for less money.  I think in some ways he succeeded in that goal.In an interview on this dvd, Jackie says that the financial constraints made shooting stunts more dangerous, because they couldn't rehearse them as much.Another interesting fact from the interview is that Jackie's house in this movie was his house in real life.This dvd is great as many others have attested.  Regarding the dubbing, I doubt it would have been possible to retain the old English dub as this version is longer than the old vhs version.  However, it would've been better if they had gotten an actor who sounded more like Jackie.Depite a few slapstick scenes, this movie has a very real feel.  The bad guys are not catoonish, and the action is not on a stage or in front of a blue screen.  When you see somebody falling off a roof, it is a real person risking his or her life to make a stunning scene.I personally agree with others that this may be Jackie's best movie.

Police Story is classic Chan at its best, including terrific action and great Chan humor.  Jackie Chan plays ""Kevin Chan"", and is a one man army in this action blast.After capturing a criminal drug lord in an explosive action-packed beginning sequence, the movie only  begins to take off, as Chan constantly fights off goon after goon wherever  he goes to protect a witness to the criminal.  The drug lord only frames Chan for killing another cop, result, Chan becomes one angry and determined man to take matters on his own hands to capture the guy once and for all, who had escaped his first capture swiftly thanks to his ridiculous lawyer at the hearing.The action is constant from beginning to end, and where there isn't Chan fighting and action, there is the comedy and humor, resulting in great pacing overall.  The real treat of Poilce Story is the final fight in the shopping mall, where fist fly, glass breaks everywhere, motorcycles run, and Chan performs an outrageous stunt that is shown 3 times from different angles during the movie - sliding down a multi-story string of lights and crashing into a glass house.  Simply amazing and one of his best known stunts ever.Poilce Story is a must for the heart of any Jackie Chan collection, and now that its on dvd you can experience this much deserved movie in better than VHS quality.

31103,A2BESHHTTDGI2Y,0780622030,EZE,"[1, 1]","I am a huge fan of Jackie Chan's work, from his first kung fu movies he's done in the 70s to the more recent stuff he's done.  There's no question that Jackie's best work comes from the 80's and 90's and this movie falls right in that time period.Considered by many to be the first modern cop movie that started them all, this is the source of all the awesome cop movies that came after it.  Even after almost 30 years, this movie still holds up.  The action is second to no other movie.

31105,A2HVL790PBWYTU,0780622030,"H. Bala ""Me Too Can Read""","[2, 2]","I have to say that I vastly prefer Jackie Chan's work during the '70s and '80s, and I prefer his Asian movies to his Hollywood movies (although RUMBLE IN THE BRONX is pretty good). Jackie Chan has so many awesome action flicks under his belt I don't know that I can say for certain that POLICE STORY is his very best film. But if it isn't his best, it's absolutely right up there with the ARMOUR OF GOD and DRUNKEN MASTER thrillers and THE YOUNG MASTER (I don't know that THE YOUNG MASTER is actually considered among his best, but it's certainly one of my favorites). Directed and starred by Jackie, POLICE STORY is entirely his vision and one perfect instance in which all the elements that constitute a Jackie Chan picture combine to form this incredible synergy. After a bad experience in Hollywood (cough*theprotector*cough) Jackie went back to Hong Kong and decided to show the world something new in the genre of police drama. If I were to suggest a Jackie Chan film to someone who had never seen a Jackie Chan film, this is the one.Jackie and gritty rarely go together, but there's a definite Dirty Harry vibe in POLICE STORY, what with Chan Ka Kui (Jackie) fighting not only drug kingpins but also police corruption. I had never seen a more edgy Jackie, and, yes, I understand the film is peppered with his trademark comedic bits. But he commits such intensity into the no-holds-barred action sequences that I'm blown away every time I see them. You can feel the impact whenever Jackie or his opponents absorb vicious blows or slam into unforgiving surfaces. This is Jackie Chan in his absolute prime, way back in 1985. I see his more recent efforts nowadays and I note how the guy has slowed down, and there's this bittersweet taste.POLICE STORY, in my eyes, presents some of the most electrifying fight scenes and certainly the biggest stunts I've ever seen Jackie do. Plenty of jawdropping action set pieces, but there are two absolute standouts: that crazy insane car chase down thru the hillside shanty town and then the brutal extended fight sequence in the shopping mall in which Jackie uses anything and everything he can get his hands on to pummel a grip of goons. The mall sequence climaxes with Jackie's amazing slide down an electrified pole. The fast and furious nighttime skirmish with Jackie battling thugs in the street - where he's hurtling in and out of vehicles - that's not too shabby, either. Just another demonstration of precision and pinpoint timing between Jackie and his trusty stunt men. But, man, I wonder how many cars Jackie demolished in this one?Humor is a constant in a Jackie Chan film, to the extent that sometimes I can't help but groan. But, here, the humor provides a stabilizing element against all the intense segments. POLICE STORY comes up with good gags, mostly involving the nonexistent romantic triangle of Jackie, Jackie's long-suffering girlfriend Maggie Cheung, and Brigitte Lin, the key witness whom Jackie is protecting. I always laugh when the film arrives at the courtroom scene. It starts out as this oh-so-dramatic event until, suddenly, it degenerates into an episode of Three's Company. For those who enjoy broad schtick, there are also moments in which pies and cakes are catapulted into people's faces.What I gots is the Special Collector's Edition DVD and its special features are very solid, even though one deleted scene presents even more pies in the face:- Director Brett Ratner and Asian Film Expert Bey Logan's informative audio commentary- Five ""Rare Deleted Scenes"" (total running time 00:16:25 minutes): 1)an extended opening with new stuff including an office surprise birthday party and Chan Ka Kui apparently having just been newly assigned to this police department; 2)a brief press conference introduction; 3) an extended ending with alternate outtakes; 4) montage of very brief deleted shots shown in continuity within the official footage; and 5) outtakes without the closing credits which means that the blooper footage now fills up the screen- ""A Conversation with Jackie Chan"" (00:10:22 minutes) - Jackie reveals fascinating behind-the-scenes stuff about the making of POLICE STORY. One tidbit we learn is that, at the end of that double-decker bus sequence, the two stunt men on the second tier of the bus were supposed to crash thru the window and land on the car instead of smashing onto the asphalt road. Also, we learn that one of the stunt men went missing somewhen during the crazy drive down thru the hillside shanty town. Jackie also talks about his concerns regarding that death-defying slide down that electrified seven-stories-high pole in the mall- ""A Tribute to Jackie Chan by Brett Ratner and Bey Logan"" (00:06:14 minutes) - these two guys talk about Jackie and POLICE STORY and the film's impact- ""Stunts Unlimited"": A retrospective with interviews of members of the celebrated Jackie Chan stunt team, and they

31106,A2TOX3E4WZ8BSQ,0780622030,"Ivan K. Samuelson ""Bolski""","[21, 23]","I first saw Police Story back in 1989 on VHS. I loved it and thought it was a riot. The fight scenes were great and I just couldn't believe the things Jackie Chan would do to put action on the screen. That is what makes his movies so great. You see the action and amazing stunts and you KNOW that is Jackie doing it, not some stunt double and since he's doing it, it's not that unbelievable. Plus, he knows how to be funny on screen and it works so well with everything going on. His fighting style is not some fancy martial arts. Like Jackie says, it's street fighting and unlike other heroes, Jackie gets so beat up and yet he still gets up and makes you cheer for the good guy.Now, with this DVD release, you get the movie the way it was. The VHS was at 90 minutes. This version is at 101 minutes which means there were some added scenes which I can't remember for the life of me. It's been so long since I saw the VHS version that I don't know what scenes were put back in.You can watch it in the English dubbed voices in 5.1, in the original Cantonese in 5.1 or the original Cantonese in mono. Personally, I love it in the Cantonese language because when they dub to American, they try to change the dialog a bit to fit the lip movement. With the Cantonese track, you get to feel the real emotions that the actors used in the scene. Also, unlike his later films, Jackie did NOT dub his own voice in here on the English track.You would think that is where it would end with this, but no. There is so much more here than the movie.First off, you have commentary by Rush Hour director Brett Ratner and Asian Film Expert Bey Logan. It's too bad Jackie didn't lend his comments as well. I would have loved that. However, you do get a conversation with Jackie Chan that lasts about 10 minutes where he goes over the stunt work, how he likes to do his own stunts, etc. It is especially interesting to know that they didn't have the budget to rehearse various stunt scenes, so they did them usually in one take. This resulted in some serious injuries, especially with the bus scene. It's amazing to hear how some people came close to death making this film, but when you watch the film, you can see why.There is also a 35-minute feature where they speak with the people of the Jackie Chan Stunt Team (Sing Ga Ban). Here, many members of this team talk about what everyone's role was, how great it was to work with Jackie, etc. A VERY interesting retrospective on Jackie and his work ethic.There is also a 6 minute feature that is a tribute to Jackie Chan with Brett Ratner talking about how this movie is so great.Along with all of this, you also get various deleted scenes, alternate opening and ending as well as a deleted scenes montage that shows some scenes wrapped in between the released scenes so you can see where they would have fit in.If you've never seen a Jackie Chan film before (what rock have you been under if you haven't?), then see this one first. The stunt work and action is raw and in real time. No wires, no digital enhancements, just pure, raw stunt work caught on film in real time.Excellent DVD release and it's about time!",5,Finally - the release we've been waiting for!,1166572800,"12 20, 2006",2006,3146,"['first', 'saw', 'Police', 'Story', 'back', '1989', 'VHS', 'loved', 'thought', 'was', 'riot', 'fight', 'scenes', 'were', 'great', 'just', 'could', ""n't"", 'believe', 'things', 'Jackie', 'Chan', 'would', 'do', 'put', 'action', 'screen', 'what', 'movies', 'so', 'great', 'see', 'action', 'amazing', 'stunts', 'KNOW', 'Jackie', 'doing', 'not', 'stunt', 'double', 'doing', 'not', 'unbelievable', 'how', 'be', 'funny', 'screen', 'so', 'well', 'everything', 'going', 'fighting', 'style', 'not', 'fancy', 'martial', 'arts', 'Jackie', 'street', 'fighting', 'other', 'heroes', 'Jackie', 'so', 'beat', 'up', 'yet', 'still', 'up', 'cheer', 'good', 'guy.Now', 'DVD', 'release', 'get', 'movie', 'way', 'was', 'VHS', 'was', '90', 'minutes', 'version', '101', 'minutes', 'were', 'added', 'scenes', 'ca', ""n't"", 'remember', 'life', 'been', 'so', 'long', 'saw', 'VHS', 'version', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'what', 'scenes', 'were', 'put', 'back', 'in.You', 'can', 'watch', 'English', 'dubbed', 'voices', '5.1', 'original', 'Cantonese', '5.1', 'original', 'Cantonese', 'mono', 'Personally', 'love', 'Cantonese', 'language', 'when', 'dub', 'American', 'try', 'change', 'dialog', 'bit', 'fit', 'lip', 'movement', 'Cantonese', 'track', 'get', 'feel', 'real', 'emotions', 'actors', 'used', 'scene', 'Also', 'later', 'films', 'Jackie', 'did', 'NOT', 'dub', 'own', 'voice', 'here', 'English', 'track.You', 'would', 'think', 'where', 'would', 'end', 'so', 'much', 'more', 'here', 'movie.First', 'off', 'have', 'commentary', 'Rush', 'Hour', 'director', 'Brett', 'Ratner', 'Asian', 'Film', 'Expert', 'Bey', 'Logan', 'too', 'bad', 'Jackie', 'did', ""n't"", 'lend', 'comments', 'well', 'would', 'have', 'loved', 'However', 'do', 'get', 'conversation', 'Jackie', 'Chan', '10', 'minutes', 'where', 'stunt', 'work', 'how', 'do', 'own', 'stunts', 'etc', 'especially', 'interesting', 'know', 'did', ""n't"", 'have', 'budget', 'rehearse', 'various', 'stunt', 'scenes', 'did', 'usually', 'one', 'take', 'resulted', 'serious', 'injuries', 'especially', 'bus', 'scene', 'amazing', 'hear', 'how', 'people', 'came', 'close', 'death', 'making', 'film', 'when', 'watch', 'film', 'can', 'see', 'also', '35-minute', 'feature', 'where', 'speak', 'people', 'Jackie', 'Chan', 'Stunt', 'Team', 'Sing', 'Ga', 'Ban', 'Here', 'many', 'members', 'team', 'talk', 'what', 'everyone', 'role', 'was', 'how', 'great', 'was', 'work', 'Jackie', 'etc', 'VERY', 'interesting', 'retrospective', 'Jackie', 'work', 'ethic.There', 'also', '6', 'minute', 'feature', 'tribute', 'Jackie', 'Chan', 'Brett', 'Ratner', 'talking', 'how', 'movie', 'so', 'great.Along', 'also', 'get', 'various', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'alternate', 'opening', 'ending', 'as', 'well', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'montage', 'scenes', 'wrapped', 'released', 'scenes', 'can', 'see', 'where', 'would', 'have', 'fit', 'in.If', ""'ve"", 'never', 'seen', 'Jackie', 'Chan', 'film', 'what', 'rock', 'have', 'been', 'have', ""n't"", 'then', 'see', 'one', 'first', 'stunt', 'work', 'action', 'raw', 'real', 'time', 'wires', 'digital', 'enhancements', 'just', 'pure', 'raw', 'stunt', 'work', 'caught', 'film', 'real', 'time.Excellent', 'DVD', 'release', 'time']",N/A

31110,A1B8HI3VREI1H3,0780622030,Jorge A. Zarco,"[3, 3]","Jackie Chan worked on the violent action movie The Protector in 1985. The film was a critical and commercial flop. Chan did not get along with director James Glickenhaus. In Hong Kong, Chan re-edited and re-shot scenes for the Hong Kong version of The Protector, but the movie was still a failure. Chan took matters into his own hands by directing and starring in Police Story(1985). He plays Chan Ka Kui. In the English dubbed versions, he's known as ""Kevin Chan"" in the UK English dub and ""Jackie Chan"" in the US New Line Cinema version released on VHS. Chan plays a Hong Kong police officer who tries to put crooked businessman Tom Koo/Chu To(Chor Yuen) in jail. Chu To frames Officer Chan for murder and he must find a way to prove that he's innocent. A young Maggie Cheung plays Chan's on screen girlfriend May. In Hong Kong, Police Story is known as Ging Chat Goo Si. The HK version is longer than the US cut and the Japanese version has more key scenes.After my high school graduation, I didn't go to sober grad or a party. I stayed at home, ate cake and pizza and watched Jackie Chan movies. Chan and his stunt team put some real elbow grease into their work. We get to see Jackie Chan kick and punch people and fly through glass! We see stuntmen fall three stories and crash into furniture. Brigette Lin plays a woman who tries to help Officer Chan prove his innocence. Bill Tung became a regular in Jackie Chan movies around this time.Police Story isn't perfect. There's a gag in a court room that has a cheap payoff! Chan throws in some slapstick humor to take the edge off the story. May hits Chan in the face with a birthday cake after getting angry! The action scene where cars drive through a dumpy town was used again in Bad Boys II(2003). The scene where a bad guy flies through a windshield was referenced in Tango and Cash(1989).

The basic plot is Jackie Chan plays a cop named Jackie Chan (Kevin in the original HK version) who has been assiend to protect a lady named Selena, who is the secretery of a drug lord named Mr. Ko, till a trial to bust up Ko's operation, and selena is going to be the witness. Unfortunetly Selena dosen't want to have a cop with her untill Jackie has anouther cop (dressed like michle Myers from Halloween) terrorize her in her house, and jackie sorta saves her and knockes the poor guy out after Selana hits him on the head with a vase. Soon, of course, when Jackie and Selena go the Jackies house they are attacked by real bad guys... Basicly the rest of the film deals with selena screwing up the trial, Jackie trying to convince his jelous girlfriend May that he's not ceating on her, Selena being kidnappend by Mr. Ku, Jackie being framed fr murder all ending in a big blow out fight in a 5 or so floor mall witch lasts about 5 to ten minuets where every pane of glasse in sight is smashed!

The movie has all the comedy, martial arts, and attractive Chinese women you'd come to expect from a Jackie Chan film. It focuses on Kenny Chan (Jackie, of course), a hong kong police man intent on busting a local drug ring. All of his attempts to do so have failed, but when he gets to close, he's framed for a murder he didn't commit. Maggie Cheung is his pretty and easily made jealous girlfriend, who would rather smash his face in with a birthday cake than see him with another woman.

31118,A2WCRX5OQM6FED,0780622030,"Mike Sehorn ""The Phantom Projectionist""","[2, 2]","By general consensus, Jackie Chan has made two very great movies above others:The Legend of Drunken Masterand ""Police Story"" here. ""Drunken Master"" is a straight kung fu film while ""Police Story"" is more of a balanced action movie, incorporating gunfights and car chases with the martial arts. On the whole, I like ""Master"" more because its story is easier to follow and it has fewer pauses between fight scenes, but ""Police Story"" is no slouch, either. While it does drag a bit in the middle, the film is a myriad of death-defying stunts and physical comedy, and its ability to almost perfectly balance the two is what has made it so unforgettable for a lot of folks.The story: Ka Kaui (Chan) is a Hong Kong policeman-turned-hero after he single-handedly captures a notorious druglord (Chor Yuen,Twin Dragons), but in midst of protecting the key witness to the gangster's trial (Brigette Lin,Chungking Express) and trying to keep his girlfriend (Maggie Cheung,In the Mood for Love) from leaving him, he is framed for the murder of another cop and needs to clear his name without getting arrested or killed.The plotline is one of the two major issues I have with the film: I suppose that someone well-versed in Hong Kong cinema or proficient in Cantonese/translated subtitles would have less of an issue understanding what's going on, but I needed to read a synopsis to clarify some of the things that happened in the complicated second half of the movie. My other beef lies with the amount of time that passes without any action scenes: rest assured, there is no shortage of thrills involved, overall, but since I find it difficult to appreciate the acting content, I felt myself losing attention more than once during the ongoing dialogue scenes. Of course, not all the performances baffle me: Chan speaks a universal language with physical comedy. As far as I'm concerned, he has surpassed his idol, Buster Keaton, in how to make people laugh via body language and has perfected the art of ""funny face"" and taking a fall. This is especially well on display when his on-screen girlfriend assaults him with his own birthday cake upon assuming infidelity. Gold.Still, it's the film's award-winning action content that makes it stand out, and as much as I could go on about it, nothing I write can come close to expressing my amazement at how well it has been done. For starters, the martial arts scenes are not quite as technically-accurate as Chan would develop them in the future, but nonetheless amazingly choreographed and well within Chan's top-ten list. There are about three big ones of varying lengths, but the final one-against-many brawl in the shopping mall is as beautiful and brutal as one can hope for. Of course, no matter how very good these hand-to-hand encounters are, the definite highpoints of the picture are the stunt scenes. Since there are too many cool instances to name individually, let me highlight the most breathtaking ones: 1) Jackie and the villains drive three cars downhill through a shanty village, destroying literally dozens of scrap metal and straw shacks in their way, 2) Jackie uses an umbrella to haphazardly hang onto the side of a speeding bus, 3) the near-entirety of the shopping mall fight, culminating in Chan's legendary leap onto an electric lighting structure, down which he slides a legitimate seventy-five feet before crashing through a glass ceiling. In a word, astonishing.So, is it my favorite Chan flick? - no. Is it awesome anyway? - without a doubt. Should you buy the Dragon Dynasty release with a host of cool and exclusive special features? - of course, silly.",4,Jackie Chan: The Model Officer,1242604800,"05 18, 2009",2009,3621,"['general', 'consensus', 'Jackie', 'Chan', 'made', 'two', 'very', 'great', 'movies', 'others', 'Legend', 'Drunken', 'Masterand', 'Police', 'Story', 'here', 'Drunken', 'Master', 'straight', 'kung', 'fu', 'film', 'Police', 'Story', 'more', 'balanced', 'action', 'movie', 'incorporating', 'gunfights', 'car', 'chases', 'martial', 'arts', 'whole', 'like', 'Master', 'more', 'story', 'easier', 'follow', 'fewer', 'pauses', 'fight', 'scenes', 'Police', 'Story', 'slouch', 'either', 'drag', 'bit', 'middle', 'film', 'myriad', 'death-defying', 'stunts', 'physical', 'comedy', 'ability', 'almost', 'perfectly', 'balance', 'two', 'made', 'so', 'unforgettable', 'lot', 'folks.The', 'story', 'Ka', 'Kaui', 'Chan', 'Hong', 'Kong', 'policeman-turned-hero', 'single-handedly', 'notorious', 'druglord', 'Chor', 'Yuen', 'Twin', 'Dragons', 'midst', 'protecting', 'key', 'witness', 'gangster', 'trial', 'Brigette', 'Lin', 'Chungking', 'Express', 'trying', 'keep', 'girlfriend', 'Maggie', 'Cheung', 'Mood', 'Love', 'leaving', 'framed', 'murder', 'cop', 'clear', 'name', 'getting', 'arrested', 'killed.The', 'plotline', 'one', 'two', 'major', 'issues', 'have', 'film', 'suppose', 'someone', 'well-versed', 'Hong', 'Kong', 'cinema', 'proficient', 'Cantonese/translated', 'subtitles', 'would', 'have', 'less', 'issue', 'understanding', 'what', 'going', 'needed', 'read', 'synopsis', 'clarify', 'things', 'happened', 'complicated', 'second', 'half', 'movie', 'other', 'beef', 'amount', 'time', 'action', 'scenes', 'rest', 'assured', 'shortage', 'thrills', 'involved', 'overall', 'find', 'difficult', 'appreciate', 'acting', 'content', 'felt', 'losing', 'attention', 'more', 'once', 'ongoing', 'dialogue', 'scenes', 'course', 'not', 'performances', 'Chan', 'universal', 'language', 'physical', 'comedy', 'As', 'far', ""'m"", 'concerned', 'surpassed', 'idol', 'Buster', 'Keaton', 'how', 'make', 'people', 'body', 'language', 'perfected', 'art', 'funny', 'face', 'taking', 'fall', 'especially', 'well', 'display', 'when', 'on-screen', 'girlfriend', 'assaults', 'own', 'birthday', 'cake', 'assuming', 'infidelity', 'Gold.Still', 'film', 'award-winning', 'action', 'content', 'stand', 'out', 'as', 'much', 'could', 'go', 'nothing', 'write', 'can', 'come', 'close', 'expressing', 'amazement', 'how', 'well', 'been', 'done', 'starters', 'martial', 'arts', 'scenes', 'are', 'not', 'quite', 'as', 'technically-accurate', 'Chan', 'would', 'develop', 'future', 'nonetheless', 'amazingly', 'choreographed', 'well', 'Chan', 'top-ten', 'list', 'are', 'three', 'big', 'ones', 'varying', 'lengths', 'final', 'one-against-many', 'brawl', 'shopping', 'mall', 'beautiful', 'brutal', 'one', 'can', 'hope', 'course', 'matter', 'how', 'very', 'good', 'hand-to-hand', 'encounters', 'are', 'definite', 'highpoints', 'picture', 'are', 'stunt', 'scenes', 'are', 'too', 'many', 'cool', 'instances', 'name', 'individually', 'let', 'highlight', 'most', 'breathtaking', 'ones', '1', 'Jackie', 'villains', 'drive', 'three', 'cars', 'downhill', 'shanty', 'village', 'destroying', 'literally', 'dozens', 'scrap', 'metal', 'straw', 'shacks', 'way', '2', 'Jackie', 'umbrella', 'haphazardly', 'hang', 'side', 'speeding', 'bus', '3', 'near-entirety', 'shopping', 'mall', 'fight', 'culminating', 'Chan', 'legendary', 'leap', 'electric', 'lighting', 'structure', 'down', 'legitimate', 'seventy-five', 'feet', 'crashing', 'glass', 'ceiling', 'word', 'astonishing.So', 'favorite', 'Chan', 'flick', 'awesome', 'anyway', 'doubt', 'Should', 'buy', 'Dragon', 'Dynasty', 'release', 'host', 'cool', 'exclusive', 'special', 'features', 'course', 'silly']",N/A
31119,APIW11UEPKIC2,0780622030,"morgoth ""we lamas are traditional enemies of ...","[2, 3]","In Jackie's first modern day action movie that he directed, he makes a couple changes to his character from what you had come to expect.  The movie starts off with Jackie and his fellow policeman getting their orders for a drug bust so they can memorize it and perform their assignment perfectly.  No comedy at the beginning will throw off any Jackie fan.  Instead of laughs we get intensity with Jackie trying to calm down his partner.  There are a lot of real humanity moments that we get like this that help make it stand out as a different Jackie Chan movie.  After a big shootout this leads to one of the most insane set pieces ever.  After recreating a huge real life shanty town, the crew demolishes it in one of the most exciting down hill chase scenes ever.  A car chase straight through the shanty town will leave you breathless with stuntmen jumping off a shanty roof and not even a half second later a car comes by that would have run him over if there had been any hesitation at all.  When they reach the bottom of the hill you think it is over but the drug dealers hijack a bus only to find Jackie hanging off of it.  When they finally beat him off the bus he comes right back.  You think just because you are in a vehicle and Jackie is on his feet you can get away?  Better think twice because this cop NEVER stops.  He falls off of a buiding, gets thrown through a window, gets beaten down to a bloody pulp and still comes back for more.  So after Jackie soley catches the criminals he is ordered to watch after the witness, the drug bosses girlfriend who is played by the stunning Brigitte Lin.  It is sad she doesn't act anymore but at least we can still go back to the 80's to see her in her younger days.  And name me another movie you see B. Lin doing her own stuntwork including being thrown through glass and being flipped over and thrown onto her back.  Maggie Cheung and Bill Tung start their 'Police Story' careers with this and both appear in the next 2 movies and Uncle Bill even shows up in the 4th('First Strike).  So the movie becomes a crime thriller with Jackie on the run from police and gangsters and does not let up except for a few brief comedy scenes.  There is not a ton of action and the fights are not super long with crazy kugn fu styles or anythign, it is actually a lot more real.  The stuntwork is the main thing that you are watchign this movie for.  The final 10 minutes you will asking how they did that more than a dozen times.  There are a lot of other movies where Jackie plays the cop role like 'Heart of the Dragon' but 'Police Story' is the one you need to see.  Not a full 5 stars but I give the movie a 9/10.This DVD release by Dragon Dynasty is superb.  Presented in a widscreen letterboxed format with 5.1 English and Chinese dub and thankfully they include the original mono track for people who like to watch and hear the movie in the way it was originally presented.Specal Features are not quite like the DD release of 'Kill Zone' but they are still better than 99% of other martial arts DVD's today.10 minute interview with Jackie talking about what he remembers about the movie.  One good point is that he wishes their was a making of because that would be a movie in itself.35 minutes with 3 members of Jackie's stuntcrew from the 80's.  TOUGH guys.6 minute tribute to Jackie from Brett Ratner and Bey Logan.The deleted scenes don't amount to much but mainly it is cool to watch the scenes where they left in the extra frames.  Not great but very well done giving you an indicator at the bottom of the screen saying where frames were added.There is also a commentary for the entire 100 minutes from Hong Kong film expert Bey Logan and director of the Rush Hour movies and X-Men, Brett Ratner.  Good, informative commentary that is worth listening to once.Dragon Dynast has shown with only 2 movies now that they may just be the top DVD company for martial arts movies.",5,Dragon Dynasty's release of Jackie Chan's 'Police Story',1163289600,"11 12, 2006",2006,3932,"['Jackie', 'first', 'modern', 'day', 'action', 'movie', 'directed', 'couple', 'changes', 'character', 'what', 'had', 'come', 'expect', 'movie', 'Jackie', 'fellow', 'policeman', 'getting', 'orders', 'drug', 'bust', 'can', 'memorize', 'perform', 'assignment', 'perfectly', 'comedy', 'beginning', 'will', 'throw', 'off', 'Jackie', 'fan', 'Instead', 'laughs', 'get', 'intensity', 'Jackie', 'trying', 'calm', 'down', 'partner', 'are', 'lot', 'real', 'humanity', 'moments', 'get', 'help', 'make', 'stand', 'out', 'different', 'Jackie', 'Chan', 'movie', 'big', 'shootout', 'one', 'most', 'insane', 'set', 'pieces', 'ever', 'recreating', 'huge', 'real', 'life', 'shanty', 'town', 'crew', 'one', 'most', 'exciting', 'down', 'hill', 'chase', 'scenes', 'ever', 'car', 'chase', 'straight', 'shanty', 'town', 'will', 'leave', 'breathless', 'stuntmen', 'jumping', 'off', 'shanty', 'roof', 'not', 'even', 'half', 'second', 'later', 'car', 'would', 'have', 'run', 'had', 'been', 'hesitation', 'When', 'reach', 'bottom', 'hill', 'think', 'drug', 'dealers', 'hijack', 'bus', 'only', 'find', 'Jackie', 'hanging', 'When', 'finally', 'beat', 'off', 'bus', 'right', 'back', 'think', 'just', 'are', 'vehicle', 'Jackie', 'feet', 'can', 'get', 'away', 'Better', 'think', 'twice', 'cop', 'NEVER', 'buiding', 'thrown', 'window', 'beaten', 'down', 'bloody', 'pulp', 'still', 'back', 'more', 'So', 'Jackie', 'soley', 'criminals', 'ordered', 'watch', 'witness', 'drug', 'bosses', 'girlfriend', 'who', 'played', 'stunning', 'Brigitte', 'Lin', 'sad', ""n't"", 'act', 'anymore', 'least', 'can', 'still', 'go', 'back', '80', 'see', 'younger', 'days', 'name', 'movie', 'see', 'B.', 'Lin', 'doing', 'own', 'stuntwork', 'including', 'being', 'thrown', 'glass', 'being', 'flipped', 'thrown', 'back', 'Maggie', 'Cheung', 'Bill', 'Tung', 'start', ""'Police"", 'Story', 'careers', 'appear', 'next', '2', 'movies', 'Uncle', 'Bill', 'even', 'up', '4th', ""'First"", 'Strike', 'movie', 'crime', 'thriller', 'Jackie', 'run', 'police', 'gangsters', 'not', 'let', 'up', 'few', 'brief', 'comedy', 'scenes', 'not', 'ton', 'action', 'fights', 'are', 'not', 'super', 'long', 'crazy', 'kugn', 'fu', 'styles', 'anythign', 'actually', 'lot', 'more', 'real', 'stuntwork', 'main', 'thing', 'are', 'watchign', 'movie', 'final', '10', 'minutes', 'will', 'asking', 'how', 'did', 'more', 'dozen', 'times', 'are', 'lot', 'other', 'movies', 'where', 'Jackie', 'cop', 'role', ""'Heart"", 'Dragon', ""'Police"", 'Story', 'one', 'need', 'see', 'Not', 'full', '5', 'stars', 'give', 'movie', '9/10.This', 'DVD', 'release', 'Dragon', 'Dynasty', 'superb', 'Presented', 'widscreen', 'letterboxed', 'format', '5.1', 'English', 'Chinese', 'dub', 'thankfully', 'include', 'original', 'mono', 'track', 'people', 'who', 'like', 'watch', 'hear', 'movie', 'way', 'was', 'originally', 'presented.Specal', 'Features', 'are', 'not', 'quite', 'DD', 'release', ""'Kill"", 'Zone', 'are', 'still', 'better', '99', '%', 'other', 'martial', 'arts', 'DVD', 'today.10', 'minute', 'interview', 'Jackie', 'talking', 'what', 'movie', 'One', 'good', 'point', 'was', 'making', 'would', 'be', 'movie', 'itself.35', 'minutes', '3', 'members', 'Jackie', 'stuntcrew', '80', 'TOUGH', 'guys.6', 'minute', 'tribute', 'Jackie', 'Brett', 'Ratner', 'Bey', 'Logan.The', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'do', ""n't"", 'amount', 'much', 'mainly', 'cool', 'watch', 'scenes', 'where', 'left', 'extra', 'frames', 'Not', 'great', 'very', 'well', 'done', 'giving', 'indicator', 'bottom', 'screen', 'saying', 'where', 'frames', 'were', 'added.There', 'also', 'commentary', 'entire', '100', 'minutes', 'Hong', 'Kong', 'film', 'expert', 'Bey', 'Logan', 'director', 'Rush', 'Hour', 'movies', 'X-Men', 'Brett', 'Ratner', 'Good', 'informative', 'commentary', 'worth', 'listening', 'once.Dragon', 'Dynast', 'shown', 'only', '2', 'movies', 'now', 'may', 'just', 'be', 'top', 'DVD', 'company', 'martial', 'arts', 'movies']",N/A

31121,ASFTYWTX1WWFE,0780622030,Shawn McKenna,"[4, 5]","French film-maker Jean-Luc Godard once said that the best criticism of one film is to make another. Jackie Chan was so dissatisfied with his experience on the cop drama The Protector, his second staring lead in an American film that he decided to make his own Police Story under his underused vanity label Golden Ways Films Ltd. In Hong Kong, he would have much more control over script, stunt coordination and direction (he made sure he would direct this film) that if he was going to flounder it would be on his terms. The result of his efforts is one of my favorite action films as well as Jackie's personal favorite amongst his modern fare.Jackie Chan plays Chan Ka Kui a model Hong Kong cop who gets involved in a police procedural code named Operation Boar Hunt to take down a triad led by Chu Tu (prolific director/actor Chor Yuen). This operation begins in a shanty town specifically built for the film. The detail is extraordinary in the design and like everything created for an action film it is short-lived. In one of the most awesome car chases I have ever witnessed on screen (up there with Bullitt and The Blue's Brother's mall scene) Chu Tu after being cornered by the police decide to drive through the hovels instead of being captured and Chan decides to chase after. The juxtaposition of having the camera in the vehicle and long shots in which stuntmen are scurrying to avoid being hit (several stuntmen were injured in this scene) are sagacious in displaying the maelstrom of destruction. That and it's pretty damn cool.Most films would have given a respite after that tumultuous scene of car and house derby but as soon as Chan finishes the car chase he goes into foot mode while running after a double-decker bus that Chu Tu and a few of his cronies hijacked. In several of these scenes as he catches up to the bus he is literally hanging by an umbrella as he holds unto the outside of the bus trying to climb his way in while fighting people who do not want him aboard as well as dodging traffic as the bus speeds along. Two of the stuntmen got hurt at the end of this scene where Ka Kui forces the bus to stop and as they flew out of the top windows they were supposed to land on top of the car that was stopped in the middle of the road but the backward momentum of the brakes as the bus rocked backward after stopping made them undershoot the stunt and land on the road.Police Story has a stronger storyline than most Chan movies to connect the action scenes. After the arrest of Chu Tu, Inspector Li sets up his secretary Selina Fong (Brigitte Lin Ching-Hsia) by letting her go free of all charges to try to pit her against her boss. Ka Kui is assigned to protect her (several scenes of this scenario were cut out of the film). This, of course, will interfere and cause problems with his girlfriend May (Maggie Cheung Man-Yuk whose relationship with Jackie is underplayed though that would change in the sequel). Chan tries to trick Selina into trusting him by pretending to save the day when Mars attacks Selina in her apartment. What ultimately happens because of this is predictable as well as the cop working for the triad but these are mere trifles.The comedy is underrated in this film. There is a great sequence in which Jackie is assigned to the Sha Tau Kok Police Station, a rural area in the north eastern corner of Hong Kong, after he completely messes up the prosecution of Chu Tu. He deftly tries to answer several phones and juggle several conversations at the same time while not being really successful in solving any of them. Like Project A, his influence by silent film comedians is shown in how he performs this skit with physical perfection. This scene is so sublime I cannot fathom why this was missing in older American prints. I also enjoyed a nice little scene where Jackie does this beautiful car-slide stunt by doing the ultimate parallel parking literary by sliding the car parallel into a spot barely bigger than the car.Another highlight of this film is the final sequence named ""glass story"" by the stuntmen. It takes place in a mall where Jackie has cornered Chu Tu and his cronies. It is 10 minutes of excellent martial arts, stunts and action. Some of the highlights is some great fights by Jackie with clothes racks, Brigitte Lin doing her own fighting, Chan doing a great jump into moving stairs, lots and lots of broken glass and the famous multi-story slide down a pole. Jackie severely burnt his hands on his slide down, partially attributed to the wrong voltage being set on the lights attached to it and it is also mentioned on several web sites and his own autobiography that he injured his spine and hip on that drop. This is a bit doubtful because on a camera with an alternate angle from the floor (shown in certain deleted footage) shows him bouncing up after the fall and slugging a stuntman (and according to Fung Hak-On hurting him). If you have ever had a back injury (I have several times) you usually do not do get up after it happens or beat up your stuntmen.This movie not only influenced the Hong Kong action picture, it would also influence American action pictures. Sylvester Stallone would use the bus scene in Tango and Cash, several early scenes were copied in Rapid Fire, Brett Ratner took so much from this film in making Rush Hour (self-admitted in commentary in Rush Hour as well as Dragon Dynasty's Police Story DVD) and countless other action choreographers and directors would be directly or indirectly affected by this work. This movie was created because of the visionary ideas of Jackie Chan and also because of the backbreaking effort of Sing Ga Ban - Jackie Chan's Stuntman Association and their every increasing effort to out due rival stuntman association led by Sammo Hung. Their backbreaking effort helped make this a hit (26 million HK dollars and win the Best Film for the Hong Kong Film Awards) and became the favorite of action auteur directors everywhere.DVD Notes: I was happy to get a R1 version of this film when Dragon Dynasty put out the DVD. The quality of the picture could be better (Police Story 2 has a much better print) but overall I am satisfied with it. The commentary with Hong Kong action movie expert Bey Logan and director Brett Ratner (Rush Hour) was decent with Logan pointing out small tidbits of information like how Sammo Hung asked Bill Tung for horse advice during shooting, pointing out the cameo by Clarence Ford (Naked Killer) as the photographer and also pointing out who every person acting was (sometimes this got annoying).

31123,A2YKADCJME4FSW,0780622030,Tom Birkenstock,"[2, 3]","For many Americans their first introduction to the work of Jackie Chan was in his fish out of water Hollywood fare like the Rush Hour movies or his 90s Hong Kong imports like Rumble in the Bronx. But Chan first attempted to break into the American market a decade or so before these films were released in theaters. Back in the eighties Jackie Chan first tried to do what only a few Asian stars before him were capable of accomplishing: become an accepted fixture of American cinema. The result was the less than stellar 1985 Hollywood action film, The Protector, which paired the Asian superstar with Danny Aiello and placed him in the middle of a decaying urban milieu. Not only was the film a box office disappointment, but Jackie Chan clashed with the director. Having experience in the director's chair, Jackie objected to the film's shoddy workmanship, unnecessary vulgarities, and quotidian action sequences. After his debilitating experience on The Protector and feeling rejected by American audiences, Chan decided to make a film completely on his own terms. The result, Police Story, not only boasts of Jackie Chan's most impressive stunts and iconic action, but also became the start of his most successful film franchise.The first Police Story film veers somewhat wildly between gritty urban cop action and broad relationship slapstick. Jackie Chan plays Ka Kui Chan, a police inspector who is assigned witness protection duty after a botched police sting codenamed ""Operation Boar Hunt."" Chan's superiors believe they possess just enough evidence to convict kingpin Chu Tao so long as they can convince his moll, Selina Fong to testify against her boss and paramour. In order to get Fong to reflexively sting her boss, Chan's superiors make it appear as if she is already working for the police by separating her from her lawyer and making sure Chan is an obvious police detail. If Chu Tao turns on Fong, then they can rely on her to run to the police for protection.None of this exactly goes according to plan. Chan's jealous girlfriend, May, becomes incensed when she discovers that he is housing another woman at his apartment. Despite the fact that May is a borderline offensive stereotype of a hysterical woman, I can see where she is coming from because Chan is kind of a cad. It might surprise many who are used to Jackie Chan's ability pull off an ""aw shucks"" shrug even as jumped buildings, ran up walls and climbed aboard vehicles at unsafe speeds but in 1985 he played a real jerk. In order to convince Fong to stay at his place, Chan hires a friend on the force to pretend to be a bedroom intruder hired by Fong's boss to kill her. Later, after Chan thinks his girlfriend May has left his apartment, he openly mocks her in front of his prize witness, unaware that May is just around the corner listening to him claim that he can get hundreds of other girls. (I almost felt bad for the actress playing May, Maggie Cheung, for being given such a thankless role. But I can't feel too bad for her because she will later put in some great work with some seminal Chinese directors like Wong Kar Wai and Zhang Yimou).Perhaps the film's humor has been lost in translation or in the decade (""hey, it was the eighties"" has become an acceptable excuse these days). Still, Jackie does a hell of a moon walk in order to wipe the bottom of his shoes clean, and a scene in which he juggles four phone lines at once reaches towards Buster Keaton levels of physical comedy (even if one of the emergency phone calls is so outrageously offensive that I have to believe it is a mistranslation). But I don't think you came to see a Jackie Chan film for his battle of the sexes humor. No, you came to see a Jackie Chan film for the tendon shearing, femur shattering stunts. In this regard the film unequivocally delivers. The opening raid is so ambitious that I doubted whether Jackie Chan could top it by the film's end, and while you can debate whether or not the film reaches the delirious heights of that raid, the closing fight in the mall sure as hell tries. In fact, several of the stunts in the raid have been borrowed by Hollywood films, but arguably to less effect. In order to evade the police, the drug dealers drive their cars straight through a shanty town, obliterating both the cars and anything in their path. Later, when trying to stop a bus that kingpin Chu Tao and his henchmen have commandeered, Chan blocks the street with a car and stares down the careening double decker with a pistol. The bus stops short, sending two criminals straight through the front window. Both scenes were borrowed by Bad Boys II and Tango and Cash, respectively, but, unlike Police Story, those films have glossy production values that somewhat mutes the action.Jackie Chan does double duty as director, and it's safe to say he directs like he fights: with a cool, quick, economic style. He uses plenty of pans and zooms throughout the film, giving the movie a buoyant energy (add a couple of jump cuts and he's halfway there to making a French New Wave film), but the kinetic feel of his directing never trips up his own stunts. Unlike modern action directors, who rely on handheld cameras and quick cuts to give the vague concept of action without actually presenting anything interesting on the screen, Chan clearly wants to preserve his stunt work so the audience can see every roundhouse, every bruise. The film clocks in at a succinct hour and forty minutes, meaning that even if you don't enjoy the humor of mid-eighties Jackie Chan, you don't have to wait long to get to ass kicking Jackie Chan. If nothing else, the movie goes down smoothly and is endlessly rewatchable, inviting us to ask again and again, how the hell did he do that?",4,A Movie on Jackie Chan's Terms,1307491200,"06 8,

These guys  aren't  faking  getting hurt - they really are  getting hurt,  and you don't need to see the end credits outtakes montage of them being  carried away to work that out. But  then, it's not as  if  Jackie Chan isn't  sharing their pain.  If it looks like  there's  a real sense of danger,  that's because there  was.Filmed comparatively  cheaply (part of it  even in Chan's own house) as  a reaction to Chan's disappointment  with  US  co-production The Protector, it's  a  mixture of impressive  action, lacklustre plotting  and broad  comedy - this is  the kind of film where the  moment you see a birthday  cake  you  know it'll end  up in  someone's  face  (the motivation can be  found  in  this  disc's deleted  scenes  if you're  interested).  If  the comedy  doesn't play so well with some  Western audiences, there's no such qualms  with  the  action, whether  it's the 16-minute opening shanty town action  scene that sees Chan hanging onto the outside  of a speeding  bus by  an  umbrella  (and saw stuntmen hospitalised after a stunt  stolen  by  Tango and cash  went  visibly wrong), and inventive fight  scene in and around  a car or  the  hardcore  action finale  in a shopping  center  where  escalators,  display cases, mirrors, lights, clothes racks and  a motor bike (don't  ask where  that came from)  all become deadly  weapons. The bill for broken glass alone must have been huge, let alone the cost in broken bones.It's  not Chan's  best film  despite being one  of his breakthrough hits, but it's certainly one of the best.  Sadly Dragon Dynasty's Region 1 NTSC DVD  doesn't have as good or  as clean a transfer as  Hong Kong Legends' UK disc: it's  acceptable but there's  a lot of  grain  and its clear that  they haven't spent  too much time  restoring it even if  the print is clear.

Video quality is fuzzy and so shaky it may make you dizzy. It looks like a hand held camera was used to copy a VCR tape while watching on a year 1960 TV while sitting on a couch in their living room. The second worse thing is that both the English and Chinese subtitles are displayed at the same time  - AND the subtitles are very often unreadable.
