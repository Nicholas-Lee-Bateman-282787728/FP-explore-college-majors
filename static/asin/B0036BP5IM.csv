1327592,AUX7KVELDYZZ6,B0036BP5IM,"Brett H ""pentangle""","[1, 1]","It is so sad that we have only 12 episodes spread across the three seasons of Garrows Law. Whilst this box set is to be welcomed it is also a matter of regret that the perverse decision was made to axe this very successful programme. What is particularly fascinating is that Sir William Garrow was a real historical figure. The writers of these programmes have clearly made a real effort to ensure that the episodes accord with what is known of his personal life. Additionally every episode is based on a true case from the annals of the Old Bailey in London, although not necessarily one with which Garrow was involved. Hence they provide an insight into the workings of the law a little over two hundred years ago.Garrow is not as widely known as he deserves. Whilst this series covers the earlier part of his career when he was a barrister, he was also a Kings Counsel prosecuting cases, although he appears here as the defending counsel. Latterly he became an English politician, rising to the post of Solicitor General and confirmed his forward thinking by, amongst other credentials, supporting animal rights which was quite a departure in the first part of the 19th century. This was a time when human rights were fairly generally ignored! The cases which are included in this series are interesting and varied and if you google the details of any of them, you will be able to verify that they were actual cases at the Old Bailey. Here Garrow is the champion of the accused and it is an interesting fact that he originated the phrase 'innocent until proved guilty'. He is also credited with originating the adversarial system of justice, in use in most Western countries with forthright cross examination of witnesses.Garrow's rather complicated personal life is also based on what happened in real life. He had a long term relationship and later married Sarah, who had previously had a relationship with a Viscount. The script writer has had to fill in the gaps, however, the significant facts which can be checked out are correct. Hence this series portrays both the working life and personal life of a highly significant historical figure in an authentic manner. Andrew Buchan puts in an impressive performance in the leading role, but mention should also be made of Alun Armstrong who is very convincing as John Southouse.It was always a valid criticism of Garrows Law that the seasons were so short, comprising just four episodes in each. Therefore this DVD set contains just 12 episodes, four from each of the three series. Brief though it is, it provides a fascinating insight into the workings of the justice system in the UK in the early 19th Century, with the added interest that it is largely based on fact.",5,Premature End of an Excellent Series,1352592000,"11 11, 2012",2012,2725,"['so', 'sad', 'have', 'only', '12', 'episodes', 'spread', 'three', 'seasons', 'Garrows', 'Law', 'Whilst', 'box', 'set', 'be', 'welcomed', 'also', 'matter', 'regret', 'perverse', 'decision', 'was', 'made', 'axe', 'very', 'successful', 'programme', 'What', 'particularly', 'fascinating', 'Sir', 'William', 'Garrow', 'was', 'real', 'historical', 'figure', 'writers', 'programmes', 'have', 'clearly', 'made', 'real', 'effort', 'ensure', 'episodes', 'accord', 'what', 'known', 'personal', 'life', 'Additionally', 'episode', 'based', 'true', 'case', 'annals', 'Old', 'Bailey', 'London', 'not', 'necessarily', 'one', 'Garrow', 'was', 'involved', 'Hence', 'provide', 'insight', 'workings', 'law', 'little', 'two', 'hundred', 'years', 'ago.Garrow', 'not', 'widely', 'known', 'Whilst', 'series', 'earlier', 'part', 'career', 'when', 'was', 'barrister', 'was', 'also', 'Kings', 'Counsel', 'prosecuting', 'cases', 'here', 'defending', 'counsel', 'Latterly', 'became', 'English', 'politician', 'rising', 'post', 'Solicitor', 'General', 'confirmed', 'forward', 'thinking', 'other', 'credentials', 'supporting', 'animal', 'rights', 'was', 'quite', 'departure', 'first', 'part', '19th', 'century', 'was', 'time', 'when', 'human', 'rights', 'were', 'fairly', 'generally', 'ignored', 'cases', 'are', 'included', 'series', 'are', 'interesting', 'varied', 'google', 'details', 'will', 'be', 'able', 'verify', 'were', 'actual', 'cases', 'Old', 'Bailey', 'Here', 'Garrow', 'champion', 'accused', 'interesting', 'fact', 'originated', 'phrase', ""'innocent"", 'proved', 'guilty', 'also', 'credited', 'originating', 'adversarial', 'system', 'justice', 'use', 'most', 'Western', 'countries', 'forthright', 'cross', 'examination', 'witnesses.Garrow', 'rather', 'complicated', 'personal', 'life', 'also', 'based', 'what', 'happened', 'real', 'life', 'had', 'long', 'term', 'relationship', 'later', 'married', 'Sarah', 'who', 'had', 'previously', 'had', 'relationship', 'Viscount', 'script', 'writer', 'had', 'fill', 'gaps', 'however', 'significant', 'facts', 'can', 'be', 'checked', 'out', 'are', 'correct', 'Hence', 'series', 'working', 'life', 'personal', 'life', 'highly', 'significant', 'historical', 'figure', 'authentic', 'manner', 'Andrew', 'Buchan', 'impressive', 'performance', 'leading', 'role', 'mention', 'should', 'also', 'be', 'made', 'Alun', 'Armstrong', 'who', 'very', 'convincing', 'John', 'Southouse.It', 'was', 'always', 'valid', 'criticism', 'Garrows', 'Law', 'seasons', 'were', 'so', 'short', 'comprising', 'just', 'four', 'episodes', 'DVD', 'set', 'just', '12', 'episodes', 'four', 'three', 'series', 'Brief', 'fascinating', 'insight', 'workings', 'justice', 'system', 'UK', 'early', '19th', 'Century', 'added', 'interest', 'largely', 'based', 'fact']",Garrow's Law - Series 1  [Region 2]

Depending on the ""Station in life"" that one was born in or held could determine the outcome of a trial whether you were guilty or not. Darrow (played greatly by Andrew Buchan) and his advisor/barrister, John Southouse (played wonderfully by Alun Armstrong of the 1980's Broadway stage play ""Nicholas Nickleby"") were determined to see ""that justice was done"" taking on some nasty cases and defending some rather looked ""down upon"" by the English judicial system of the day individuals  and  some who were not very likely to receive justice from the court.In this two-disc set with four episodes running about an hour each episode, the audience gets to see the makings of a the very determined ""justice for all"" Barrister  Darrow  with, of course, his frustrations, battles, love and failures.  This ""period drama"" gives the audience a splendid idea of the English ""court system""  in the 1700s and the workings thereof so very well.  (One really had a very slim chance of receiving any justice until Darrow sought to change ""things"") This series is so very great--as I said before the direction and acting are wonderful.

1327606,A2T2A4YSJ9YWV4,B0036BP5IM,Gerard D. Launay,"[16, 16]","I will disagree with a previous reviewer - Garrow is no Rumpole.  I think what made the ""Rumpole of the Bailey"" series so interesting is the subtle humor and imperfections of the Barrister.  Leo McKern took a literary personality and played it to such perfection that he made his characterization ""definitive.""  Yes...I love the Rumpole series.So for those interested in British law - this is my second choice for a mini-series.  Don't get me wrong - it is very well done - although Garrow comes off a little too flawless.  He is smart, young, roguishly attractive...and a bit too arrogant and superior at times.  His desire for justice in a court of law - fundamental fairness, if you will - is palpable.In terms of acting, I actually preferred his solicitor - John Southouse - played superbly by Alun Armstrung who tries to restrain his young charge from becoming a raving revolutionary. I also enjoyed Magistrate Buller played in a sinister tone by Michael Culkin.The costumes, sets, and historical detail are outstanding...and the stories excellent. I understand these are real cases tried in the Old Bailey - the original Criminal Courts of London.  I rather liked the first episode best when Garrow tries his first case, and makes the kind of mistake most lawyers do in the beginning - get so wrapped up in their own brilliance they forget that their single duty is to persuade the jury or judge of the rightness of their client.What makes the series most compelling for me is that it shows the extremely difficult job of defending an accused in criminal court during the eighteenth century when the defense attorney was so handicapped.  The defense lawyer was not allowed to call his own witnesses...he was not allowed to look directly at the jury...he was not allowed to make a ""closing argument"" in the case. No, it is the Judge who makes the closing argument and he can and will emphasize the facts which he wants the jury to consider most. Basically, Sir William Garrow has to do the whole show by cross-examining the prosecution's witnesses and showing the flaws in their testimony. How this exceptionally good lawyer overcomes these handicaps stirs the passions and the mind.So taken as a whole, I have no difficulty giving ""Garrow's Law"" 5 stars. Series II has a valuable ""extra"" which is a 20 minute biography of the real William Garrow - the lawyer who first introduced the idea that a man is presumed innocent until proven guilty.  We take that principle for granted.  But this uncommonly principled man fought enemies in court to make this law.  He also introduced new ideas about proper evidence, such as the unreliability of ""hearsay"" - second hand gossip.

It was Sir William Garrow (1760-1840) who lead the way and coined: ""Innocent until proven guilty."" He was accepted to the bar in 1783. In real life, and the TV series, he is idealistic, a Robin Hood for the poor and unfairly arrested. He is young, eager, wayward, belligerent, rash, arrogant, inexperienced, loud, but often a winner. This set resembles the poor depicted in Catherine Cookson TV adaptations--a must own series as well.Excellent cast:Andrew Buchan (Cranford) is Garrow, in looks and attitude. He could be played no better.Lyndsey Marshall (Being Human) plays Lady Sarah Hill, exquisite in acting as well as filling her delightful period aristocracy costumes.Alun Armstrong (Little Dorrit, New Tricks) plays the true-to-history character, John Southouse, Garrow's mentor, a solicitor (attorney).Michael Culkin (The Hours, Lolita) is Judge Buller, mostly ruthless.Rupert Graves (Forsyte Sage, Death at a Funeral-see the UK version) plays MP Sir Arthur, Sarah's spouse.Aidan McArdle (The Duchess, Ella Enchanted) is another REAL historical figure, John Silvester, a proud, rich, barrister who constantly opposes Garrow.Costumes (1200+) are astounding, sumptuous, and accurate. Edinburgh, Dumbarton, and Glasgow were filming sites. Music is as fine as the interior sets. The writing is the masterpiece behind the plots and stories taken from historical research of The Bailey cases of the time. The dynamic dialogue even offers periodic comedy. This is more like a historical documentary than TV drama, but the presentation is suspenseful, dramatic, and as finely done as anything on today's TV schedule. Not just 5 stars, but PLATNUM STARS.4 episodes each an hour, so when a feature-length typically costs $20, this near 3-feature-length set is a value.1: Garrow struggles in his 1st case but attracts the eye of lady Sarah. Next a life or death defense of a servant girl accused of murder of her new born.2. Garrow reluctantly defends `The Monster', a female assulter. Resultantly he looses popularity--but not with Lady Sarah. Will new evidence be allowed in time?3. Garrow's defense of a man charged with raping his maid puts him in Sarah's disfavor. Even his mentor questions some of Garrow's other personal & court reckless behavior. What can Garrow do for a lace thief pair?4. Garrow takes a murdering prostitute case followed by one of treason. Lady Sarah gets involved & pregnant. There are implications related to her husband, MP Sir Arthur.Bonus includes SUBTITLES, Behind the Scenes, Photos, 6 text fimlographies, Garrow text bio.",5,Excellent courtroom law series of 1700s real cases,1319068800,"10 20, 2011",2011,3165,"['Historical', 'drama', 'done', 'excellence', 'level', 'Foyle', 'War', 'British', 'courtroom', 'drama', '1792', 'date', 'given', 'away', 'dialogue', 'Pres', 'Washington', 'new', '2nd', 'term', 'series', 'already', 'won', 'Best', 'History', 'award', 'should', 'win', 'more', 'award', 'future', 'absolute', 'perfection', 'late-18th', 'century', 'historical', 'reproduction', 'sets', 'costumes', 'dialogue', 'plots', 'cases', 'people', 'are', 'real', 'British', 'history', 'criminal', 'court', 'Old', 'Bailey', 'Rumpole', 'Bailey', 'made', 'court', 'popular', 'TV', 'series', 'now', 'documents', 'true', 'historical', 'beginning', 'criminal', 'justice', 'accused', 'was', 'Sir', 'William', 'Garrow', '1760-1840', 'who', 'lead', 'way', 'coined', 'Innocent', 'proven', 'guilty', 'was', 'accepted', 'bar', '1783', 'real', 'life', 'TV', 'series', 'idealistic', 'Robin', 'Hood', 'poor', 'unfairly', 'arrested', 'young', 'eager', 'wayward', 'belligerent', 'rash', 'arrogant', 'inexperienced', 'loud', 'often', 'winner', 'set', 'poor', 'depicted', 'Catherine', 'Cookson', 'TV', 'adaptations', 'must', 'own', 'series', 'well.Excellent', 'cast', 'Andrew', 'Buchan', 'Cranford', 'Garrow', 'looks', 'attitude', 'could', 'be', 'played', 'better.Lyndsey', 'Marshall', 'Being', 'Human', 'Lady', 'Sarah', 'Hill', 'exquisite', 'acting', 'as', 'well', 'filling', 'delightful', 'period', 'aristocracy', 'costumes.Alun', 'Armstrong', 'Little', 'Dorrit', 'New', 'Tricks', 'true-to-history', 'character', 'John', 'Southouse', 'Garrow', 'mentor', 'solicitor', 'attorney', '.Michael', 'Culkin', 'Hours', 'Lolita', 'Judge', 'Buller', 'mostly', 'ruthless.Rupert', 'Graves', 'Forsyte', 'Sage', 'Death', 'Funeral-see', 'UK', 'version', 'MP', 'Sir', 'Arthur', 'Sarah', 'spouse.Aidan', 'McArdle', 'Duchess', 'Ella', 'Enchanted', 'REAL', 'historical', 'figure', 'John', 'Silvester', 'proud', 'rich', 'barrister', 'who', 'constantly', 'Garrow.Costumes', '1200+', 'are', 'astounding', 'sumptuous', 'accurate', 'Edinburgh', 'Dumbarton', 'Glasgow', 'were', 'filming', 'sites', 'Music', 'as', 'fine', 'interior', 'sets', 'writing', 'masterpiece', 'plots', 'stories', 'taken', 'historical', 'research', 'Bailey', 'cases', 'time', 'dynamic', 'dialogue', 'even', 'periodic', 'comedy', 'more', 'historical', 'documentary', 'TV', 'drama', 'presentation', 'suspenseful', 'dramatic', 'finely', 'done', 'anything', 'today', 'TV', 'schedule', 'Not', 'just', '5', 'stars', 'PLATNUM', 'STARS.4', 'hour', 'so', 'when', 'feature-length', 'typically', '20', 'near', '3-feature-length', 'set', 'value.1', 'Garrow', '1st', 'case', 'eye', 'lady', 'Sarah', 'Next', 'life', 'death', 'defense', 'servant', 'girl', 'accused', 'murder', 'new', 'born.2', 'Garrow', 'reluctantly', 'Monster', 'female', 'assulter', 'Resultantly', 'popularity', 'not', 'Lady', 'Sarah', 'Will', 'new', 'evidence', 'be', 'allowed', 'time', '3', 'Garrow', 'defense', 'man', 'charged', 'raping', 'maid', 'Sarah', 'disfavor', 'Even', 'mentor', 'questions', 'Garrow', 'other', 'personal', 'court', 'reckless', 'behavior', 'What', 'can', 'Garrow', 'do', 'lace', 'thief', 'pair', '4', 'Garrow', 'murdering', 'prostitute', 'case', 'followed', 'one', 'treason', 'Lady', 'Sarah', 'involved', 'pregnant', 'are', 'implications', 'related', 'husband', 'MP', 'Sir', 'Arthur.Bonus', 'SUBTITLES', 'Scenes', 'Photos', '6', 'text', 'fimlographies', 'Garrow', 'text', 'bio']",Garrow's Law - Series 1  [Region 2]

Caught up in litigation are those who are poor, indigent, in service or from the 'lower' social orders. At the same time the system of enclosure was taking place, in which peasants were forced off common arable land by the upper classes thus creating a landless working class which was fodder for the industrial revolution.Enter our hero and his mentor, who disturbed by the moral injustices they are witnessing fight the good fight in the courts of law. Garrow himself, the son of a much despised school master, is outside the system himself--well educated [though he lost his opportunity to be at Oxford] and brilliant but as one of his adversaries says, no gentleman. They are joined by the most ethical Lady Sarah, who will find her high mindedness brings her a great deal of trouble with her corrupt husband.As other reviewers have pointed out, the episodes are based on actual cases and are fascinating in themselves as we see the development of the system of law most of us take for granted, though we should not. The socioeconomic/ class aspects and the tragedies of the individuals caught up in the times  are just as moving and make for high drama. Not to be missed.

He makes many mistakes and as a result his first client is hanged for a crime he did not commit.  Garrow quickly determines that justice and the English law as practiced at the Old Bailey often may not be on speaking terms.  After the first disastrous case Garrow learns quickly and we watch with satisfaction as he defends clients who would probably have been convicted and hanged if it were not for his skilled defense.  In the last case, and one of best in the four televised programs, Garrow defends a man falsely accused of treason; his punishment, if convicted, would be to be hanged, taken down from the gallows while still alive, and eviscerated before his very eyes - hanged, drawn, and quartered. We watch with rapt attention as Garrow makes his summation and appeal to the jury and then hold our breaths as we wait for the verdict.Much time and effort has gone into the production of this series.  The sets and constumes are meticulously created to take the viewer back to the late 18th Century in London.  The stories are genuinely entertaining and the writing is crisp and realistic.  Lastly, the acting of all the players, particularly Garrow, is first rate.  It was only by fortunate accident that I learned of this series and then checked the two glowing reviews on Amazon.

This historical drama is so fascinating because it's all based on real events. It is absolutely amazing to see the impact one man can have on history. Garrow was divinely inspired and immensely bold. What better topic around which to weave a series? The cases are interesting. The sets help to bring the poverty, desperation, stench, and opulence alive.
