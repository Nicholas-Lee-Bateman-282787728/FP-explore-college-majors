589935,A3W4GJR5CCADBX,B00005JKNF,"""50cent-haircut""","[8, 12]","To call this film a murder mystery or a whodunit is somewhat of a misleading understatement. The form and structure of the movie follows that archetypical mystery structure, but the film is one of the most remarkable commentaries on class and family in a bygone era captured by camera. Credit Julian Fellows for his excellent screenplay. The script captures the era, the atmosphere and mannerisms of the people inhabiting it to a perfect pitch, and Robert Altman is as game as ever in transposing Fellows' vision to film as only he can. This is definitely Altman's best film since ""The Player"". Ensemble acting is superb; the actors are unselfish in a refreshingly anti-Hollywood way. It brings a smile to my face to see a film that treats the subject matter of the story with more reverence than the actors' egos. The disc itself is gorgeous; the commentaries and special features are generous and edifying - they enrich the understanding of the film.

Maggie Smith gives an exceptional performance, and the intertwined yet distanced relationships between the upstairs and downstairs inhabitants is perfection. Clive Owen (Parks) and Kelly MacDonald (Mary) are fantastic, and their small, rather chaste kiss was only an almost-satisfying culmination of their friendship/romance. However both their characters were supremely well-acted. Emily Watson plays Elsie to a T...completely believable, superbly acted. The costumes, sets, and every detail were wonderful...everything believable. Jeremy Northam singing was a delightful surprise and bonus to the film.

A lady enters and is driven away. &#8220;Is everything OK?&#8221; [An American expression.] It is November 1932. [Note the dirt road.] Servants help the arriving guests. A big house needs a lot of servants. One man carries a small dog. One guest makes films in Hollywood. [Does the servant&#8217;s language reflect their status?] One film was a flop. One guest has a special diet. The servants are known by their master&#8217;s name [to simplify things]. The small talk by the servants tell about their interests. Ivor Novello&#8217; servant used to be an actor. [Is that remark about &#8220;Charlie Chan&#8221; movies historical for 1932?] We also hear the comments of the masters. One couple has an argument. The table seating of servants is by the rank of their masters.The table talk tells of the master&#8217;s interests. A lady talks to a manservant; she is bored. One maid washes a shirt late at night. A valet visits a lonely lady. The morning sees the men gathering for a shooting party. One woman worries about her husband&#8217;s lack of a job. Servants beat the woods to drive the game birds into the air so they can be shot down for sport. Dogs retrieve the fallen birds. Lunch is served outdoors. One man seems desperate for funding. Will a daughter&#8217;s allowance be stopped? Cards after dinner? The producer talks about his movie &#8220;Charlie Chan in London&#8221;. It takes place at a country mansion. A maid speaks out her place! What will happen to Elsie now? Ivor sings while he plays the piano. [Don&#8217;t they have a radio or Victrola?]An unknown man carries a knife and uses it! Who was absent from the party? Shouldn&#8217;t the host be with his guests? A scream halts the party! The guests enter the room. A woman faints. The police are called. An Inspector and Constable arrive. No one will leave now. Is there much blood from the wound? What does that mean? Does her Ladyship need company? In the morning the Inspector talks to the servants. The guests have breakfast. The servants talk about the murder. The cook tells about her job in a factory. Who benefitted from the murder? The other servants learn about the background of another. Why do some people have a talent for getting rich?The guests gather in a room, they can&#8217;t leave until the Inspector releases them. The story continues to amble on. We learn a new fact about the parentage of a man. [Is this scene believable?] Jennings needs a rest. One servant speaks ill of the dead. One servant has a police record. The guests drive away. One woman asks &#8220;why did you do it?&#8221; She replies. Does the gift of anticipation make a good servant? She will keep her secret. A departing guest tips a servant. Two sisters talk. Being alive is what matters. And so this movie finally ends.A long list of credits follow. The location was Syon House, owned by the Duke of Northumberland.

589938,A18BD98SU49UB7,B00005JKNF,"Adam Hunnicutt ""A.H.""","[1, 3]","Robert Altman must have woke up one morning and turned the tv to public television. On the tv there may have been a little show known as ""Mystery"" or ""Poirot"". As he sat there staring into the tube, enjoying the show, he probably said something like this: ""I wanna make one of those."" And thus, ""Gosford Park"" was born.Of course there were other inspirations for Gosford Park, probably an entire list of them, but it felt like a late night episode of ""Father Cadfiel"". Not that that's bad, but if a decent murder mystery / cast rich film can recieve awards, shouldn't we consider the lesser? Gosford Park is a good movie, a really good one. But, If you don't have interest in period films, or have problem's with quick, overlapping and sometimes unintelligable dialogue (sub-t are helpful) then don't see it. The British accent's neither help nor hinder the problem.(If you have a surround sound set-up, listen out for the cigarette effect that takes place in left speaker, when the inspector first goes into the kitchen with the servants. It is a nice touch.)Maggie Smith is always good in whatever she does, and transend's what could have been a drab character creating some nifty moments. You can tell she had fun with the material. The most interesting character was the Inspector, who's detatched effort's made me sit up in my seat. His performance reminded me of something Orson Welles would do if he were living today in his prime. Ryan Phillippe seemed out of place, but its good to see that he's branching out of the ""Teen flick"" category, and took a great step by participating. Freddy Prinze should follow his example (unfortunately he has been tackled to continue in the next two Scooby-poo sequels).As a fan of period film's, I liked Gosford Park, but if I were just an everyday movie goer who had low tolerance for quick dialogue and spent my life avoiding shows like ""Mystery"", then you may want to miss it. ~s.a.o.s.~",3,"Want to take a walk in the ""Park""...",1025481600,"07 1, 2002",2002,1933,"['Robert', 'Altman', 'must', 'have', 'woke', 'up', 'one', 'morning', 'turned', 'tv', 'public', 'television', 'tv', 'there', 'may', 'have', 'been', 'little', 'show', 'known', 'Mystery', 'Poirot', 'sat', 'staring', 'tube', 'enjoying', 'show', 'probably', 'said', 'something', 'wan', 'na', 'make', 'one', 'thus', 'Gosford', 'Park', 'was', 'born.Of', 'course', 'were', 'other', 'inspirations', 'Gosford', 'Park', 'probably', 'entire', 'list', 'felt', 'late', 'night', 'episode', 'Father', 'Cadfiel', 'Not', 'bad', 'decent', 'murder', 'mystery', '/', 'cast', 'rich', 'film', 'can', 'recieve', 'awards', 'should', ""n't"", 'consider', 'lesser', 'Gosford', 'Park', 'good', 'movie', 'really', 'good', 'one', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'interest', 'period', 'films', 'have', 'problem', 'quick', 'overlapping', 'sometimes', 'unintelligable', 'dialogue', 'sub-t', 'are', 'helpful', 'then', 'do', ""n't"", 'see', 'British', 'accent', 'help', 'hinder', 'problem', 'have', 'surround', 'sound', 'set-up', 'listen', 'out', 'cigarette', 'effect', 'place', 'left', 'speaker', 'when', 'inspector', 'first', 'kitchen', 'servants', 'nice', 'touch', 'Maggie', 'Smith', 'always', 'good', 'transend', 'what', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'drab', 'character', 'creating', 'nifty', 'moments', 'can', 'tell', 'had', 'fun', 'material', 'most', 'interesting', 'character', 'was', 'Inspector', 'who', 'detatched', 'effort', 'made', 'sit', 'up', 'seat', 'performance', 'reminded', 'something', 'Orson', 'Welles', 'would', 'do', 'were', 'living', 'today', 'prime', 'Ryan', 'Phillippe', 'seemed', 'place', 'good', 'see', 'branching', 'Teen', 'flick', 'category', 'took', 'great', 'step', 'participating', 'Freddy', 'Prinze', 'should', 'follow', 'example', 'unfortunately', 'been', 'tackled', 'continue', 'next', 'two', 'Scooby-poo', 'sequels', '.As', 'fan', 'period', 'film', 'liked', 'Gosford', 'Park', 'were', 'just', 'everyday', 'movie', 'goer', 'who', 'had', 'low', 'tolerance', 'quick', 'dialogue', 'spent', 'life', 'avoiding', 'shows', 'Mystery', 'then', 'may', 'want', 'miss', '~s.a.o.s.~']",N/A
589939,AHL35XZ3OND2Z,B00005JKNF,Adron Gardner,"[0, 0]","Delightfully odd is what I call Gosford Park.  Without getting as picky as many other reviews floating around, I'd say this cross of an Agatha Christie Ms. Marple mixed with Howard's End.  Even then, I'm making it seem quite dark - which it isn't.  This is the most entertaining ensemble piece I've seen in a very long time and Altman has an effortless touch with so many legendary actors crammed into an old house around a dead body.In a sense, there's almost too much going on for the film's own good.  In the last third, some characters drift in and out of the narrative simply because the plot gets in the way which is a disappointment compared to the first chunk of the film.  Before the body turns up, it's less a forced setup for suspects than a supreme exercise in just hanging out.  Howard Hawks made a western in the same style with John Wayne, Dean Martin, Walter Brennan and Ricky Nelson called Rio Bravo.  There too do we get caught up in the daily musings and sing song of some old friends locked in a jail house.  There too does the film lose steam when the story gets in the way.  But here, one must congratulate Altman for corralling so much talent and funneling it into something genuinely entertaining and, at times, even absorbing.Gosford Park is a victim of its quality.  There's so much to see and so much to tell, when he gets around to making a movie out of it, it's just not as interesting as what came before.

Everyone claims to have made an Altman-eque film. Gosford Park is a very timely film by the auteur extraordinaire to remind the world what a genuine Altman film is all about. Gosford Park pokes fun at the British class system and its associated snobbery, nods to the dying mystery theatre genre, but most importantly, displays his unique cinematic visions and styles. The film opens its curtains with an outsized ensemble of strong actors, who are introduced in a rapid-fire, round-robin fashion. The stage is set in a traditional Agatha Christie-style English mansion with a class-divided up-stair/down-stair. The fast paced, interleaved introduction gives all the talented actors enough room to showcase their dazzling acting prowess and establish their respective characters; as well,  the busy beginning builds up great dramatic tension and pushes the storyline forward. Like in Short Cuts and Nashville, Altman pays close attentions to create a smooth homophonic texture: each character stretches in his own direction, creates dramatic frictions, pushes the plot to a culmination, and eventually comes back to the tonic note. Gosford Park lacks the earth-moving climax of Short Cuts, but makes up with plenty of well-polished period piece details.

The hosting aristocrats are Michael Gambon and Kristin Scott Thomas. Jeremy Northam and Maggie Smith are part of the upper crust. Numbered among the servants and valets are the late Alan Bates, Clive Owen, Derek Jacobi, and Ryan Philippe. Helen Mirren herself is in charge of the servants. Talented actors, beautiful production design, elegant costumes, period music-- and yet it falls flat.Needless to say,all there is to this costume drama are the costumes,even with the great Stephen Fry as the detective. Much of the movie is confused and consists of people muttering to each other. It's nearly unintelligible (maybe it needed subtitles-it was Altman's foreign film)""Gosford Park"" ends up being an overrated,gussied up spectacle.

People of consequences gather for a bit of sucking up, bringing their personal valets and maids behind them to jump to their every whim. For life above stairs Lords, Ladies and any other hangers on all seem locked in their own boredom flocking and circling like vultures trying to remain civil to others while flushing out their position and rank in society and excising it whenever possible. Everyone  has one mission for the weekend to see how rich they can stay, so they can remain to keep their life of boredom. Above stairs is full of talk; each eccentric visitor has their own story.....and a motive.Meanwhile in the kitchens and corridors below-stairs the servants run around for the comfort of their employees, filled to the brim with bustling mess, gossip and duties all keeping them extremely busy. While some servant's duties bring them above stairs they remain discreet and in their place, although their all eyes and ears they pretend in front of the upper curst that their antics just didn't happen. Again below stairs every servant has their own skeletons and story.Events of the weekend begin to bridge generations, class, sex and personal tragedy this finally leads to a midnight murder, the fact being it's a whodunit but the real question lingers in the whole household, Does anyone seem bothered?My Notes on the FilmDirected by Robert Altman, I love this film it's just wonderful; before I go any further into the mention of cast, I must add Gosford Park is meant to be a satirical film although I didn't realize that until I got into the film, I begun to treat it as just that, although part comedy and part murder mystery the focus of this film is based on the characters and every character has their moment in this film. It's about the goings on above and below stairs in the 1930's with many, many stories of different lives weaved into it, best thing to do would be to sit back and enjoy it, let the film and story line wash over you. Although there is a murder, let that take the back seat with so much else flowing through this film the murder takes the smallest role let it remain a piece of irony.CastWhere do I begin.... fantastic cast, a lot of British acting talent in this film, two wonderful actress really stood out, (The Two English Dames)  Helen Mirren and Maggie Smith both excelled their talents in this film Mirren portrays Mrs Wilson the perfect servant who's a respected embittered housekeeper and Maggie Smith as Constance, the cash strapped Grand Dame. From the male leads a stand out for me was Jeremy Northam portraying the suave visiting celebrity Ivor Novello his just marvellous.The rest of the cast would be either British or American, all are equally brilliant, pulling together to keep it really entertaining, some faces are more familiar than others Ryan Phillippe, Eileen Atkins, Alan Bates, Kelly Macdonald, Richard E Grant, Clive Owen, Derek Jacobi, Emily Waston, Kirstin Scott Thomas, Michael Gambon, Charles Dance, even Stephen Fry makes a small apperance, The whole cast in this film even the new I have not named would be a great talent to watch.Robert Altman I praise for doing a wonderful job to this film and Julian Fellows for the screenwriting, Sometimes with a lot of great talent in one film it doesn't always seem to work but for this film it certainly does.ExtrasThe making of Gosford Park, The Authenticity of Godford Park, Deleted Scenes, Filmmakers Q&A; Session.A.Bowhill",5,"Gosford Park, November 1932, where events take place that bridge generations, class, sex, personal tragedy......and murder.",1167523200,"12 31, 2006",2006,3720,"['FilmGosford', 'Park', 'magnificent', 'country', 'estate', 'owned', 'Sir', 'William', 'McCordle', 'Michael', 'Gambon', 'bored', 'trophy', 'wife', 'Lady', 'Sylvia', 'Kirstin', 'Scott', 'Thomas', 'have', 'extended', 'hand', 'hospitality', 'relations', 'friends', 'join', 'shooting', 'party', 'weekend', 'People', 'consequences', 'gather', 'bit', 'sucking', 'up', 'bringing', 'personal', 'valets', 'maids', 'jump', 'whim', 'life', 'stairs', 'Lords', 'Ladies', 'other', 'hangers', 'seem', 'locked', 'own', 'boredom', 'flocking', 'circling', 'vultures', 'trying', 'remain', 'civil', 'others', 'flushing', 'out', 'position', 'rank', 'society', 'excising', 'whenever', 'possible', 'Everyone', 'one', 'mission', 'weekend', 'see', 'how', 'rich', 'can', 'stay', 'can', 'remain', 'keep', 'life', 'boredom', 'stairs', 'full', 'talk', 'eccentric', 'visitor', 'own', 'story', '..and', 'motive.Meanwhile', 'kitchens', 'corridors', 'below-stairs', 'servants', 'run', 'around', 'comfort', 'employees', 'filled', 'brim', 'bustling', 'mess', 'gossip', 'duties', 'keeping', 'extremely', 'busy', 'servant', 'duties', 'bring', 'stairs', 'remain', 'discreet', 'place', 'eyes', 'ears', 'pretend', 'front', 'upper', 'curst', 'antics', 'just', 'did', ""n't"", 'happen', 'Again', 'stairs', 'servant', 'own', 'skeletons', 'story.Events', 'weekend', 'begin', 'bridge', 'generations', 'class', 'sex', 'personal', 'tragedy', 'finally', 'midnight', 'murder', 'fact', 'being', 'whodunit', 'real', 'question', 'lingers', 'whole', 'household', 'Does', 'anyone', 'seem', 'bothered', 'Notes', 'FilmDirected', 'Robert', 'Altman', 'love', 'film', 'just', 'wonderful', 'go', 'further', 'mention', 'cast', 'must', 'add', 'Gosford', 'Park', 'meant', 'be', 'satirical', 'film', 'did', ""n't"", 'realize', 'got', 'film', 'begun', 'treat', 'just', 'part', 'comedy', 'part', 'murder', 'mystery', 'focus', 'film', 'based', 'characters', 'character', 'moment', 'film', 'goings', 'stairs', '1930', 'many', 'many', 'stories', 'different', 'lives', 'weaved', 'best', 'thing', 'do', 'would', 'be', 'sit', 'back', 'enjoy', 'let', 'film', 'story', 'line', 'wash', 'murder', 'let', 'take', 'back', 'seat', 'so', 'much', 'else', 'flowing', 'film', 'murder', 'smallest', 'role', 'let', 'remain', 'piece', 'irony.CastWhere', 'do', 'begin', 'fantastic', 'cast', 'lot', 'British', 'acting', 'talent', 'film', 'two', 'wonderful', 'actress', 'really', 'stood', 'out', 'Two', 'English', 'Dames', 'Helen', 'Mirren', 'Maggie', 'Smith', 'excelled', 'talents', 'film', 'Mirren', 'Mrs', 'Wilson', 'perfect', 'servant', 'who', 'respected', 'embittered', 'housekeeper', 'Maggie', 'Smith', 'Constance', 'cash', 'strapped', 'Grand', 'Dame', 'male', 'stand', 'out', 'was', 'Jeremy', 'Northam', 'portraying', 'suave', 'visiting', 'celebrity', 'Ivor', 'Novello', 'just', 'marvellous.The', 'rest', 'cast', 'would', 'be', 'British', 'American', 'are', 'equally', 'brilliant', 'pulling', 'together', 'keep', 'really', 'entertaining', 'are', 'more', 'familiar', 'others', 'Ryan', 'Phillippe', 'Eileen', 'Atkins', 'Alan', 'Bates', 'Kelly', 'Macdonald', 'Richard', 'E', 'Grant', 'Clive', 'Owen', 'Derek', 'Jacobi', 'Emily', 'Waston', 'Kirstin', 'Scott', 'Thomas', 'Michael', 'Gambon', 'Charles', 'Dance', 'even', 'Stephen', 'Fry', 'small', 'apperance', 'whole', 'cast', 'film', 'even', 'new', 'have', 'not', 'named', 'would', 'be', 'great', 'talent', 'watch.Robert', 'Altman', 'praise', 'doing', 'wonderful', 'job', 'film', 'Julian', 'Fellows', 'screenwriting', 'Sometimes', 'lot', 'great', 'talent', 'one', 'film', ""n't"", 'always', 'seem', 'work', 'film', 'certainly', 'making', 'Gosford', 'Park', 'Authenticity', 'Godford', 'Park', 'Deleted', 'Scenes', 'Filmmakers', 'Q', 'A', 'Session.A.Bowhill']",N/A
589947,ANCOMAI0I7LVG,B00005JKNF,Andrew Ellington,"[3, 3]","The more I chew on `Gosford Park', the more I'm convinced that it may very well be Altman's best film.  Sure, I haven't seen a lot of his films, and some of them I'm not really all too keen on (his style as a director and screenwriter is an acquired taste, and that said style doesn't work all the time), but this film is really, truly impressive all the way around.  The best thing about this film though, is that it ages very well.  The first time I saw this film I merely liked it, but as time goes by the memory of this film only gets better, and with recent viewings it has become apparent to me that this particular social commentary only gets better and better with time.When `Gosford Park' is mentioned, usually the first conversation hinges on the cast, more specifically the large female cast.  I'm going to save them for last.It is 1932 and we are at a large (very large) country house in England.  A group of sophisticated socialites have gathered together for a shooting party, and almost instantaneously the distinctions are made and the parties divide; the wealthy to their lackadaisical meanderings, the servants to their countless duties.  With a twist of `Clue' proportions thrown in, a man (a very prominent figure) shows up dead and just about everyone is suspect.For anyone who has delved into Altman's work, the layered texture of this films script will not come as a shock to you.  From the very beginning of his career, Altman has built his films on a brisk yet complex interchange of dialog.  For me, this film may be the best fit for Altman's use of words, and his ability to capture so much from a mere glimpse of individual communications.  As the LARGE ensemble cast confine themselves in corners, whispering knowledge of one another and trying heartily to solve the mystery themselves, Altman paints a profound and engrossing study of humanity.  As some have mentioned, this film really sinks into the layers of human complexity, fleshing out the motives to our actions, to our words; the very inner workings that move us to action.  It pains me that some dismiss this film without ever really giving it a chance to sink into their minds.I almost did.I'm thrilled that Oscar handed out their screenplay award to this film, for it really is a very complex yet attainable work of art.  The way that Altman breathily moves from character to character, just as the camera swoons in and out of each room, is just breathtaking.  He truly creates real people, and he does so with a tightly woven yet briskly realized collection of conversations that relay the fragility of human frailty without ever losing the earnestness (and humor) needed to create something fresh and entertaining.And now, we get to the ladies.I'm going to start by listing them off.  Maggie Smith, Helen Mirren, Kristen Scott Thomas, Kelly Macdonald and Emily Watson.  Those are just your big names, or recognizable faces, but they really do make the biggest impact.  Mirren and Smith were both Oscar nominated, and they were both outstanding in their respective roles.  Mirren is, without doubt, the better of the two.  Her tortured yet commanding presence perfectly reflects not only her character's social standing (her servitude is very reminiscent of Hopkin's astonishing turn in `The Remains of the Day') but also her inner soul; her person removed from manipulated impressions.  I love what Smith does here (her sudden burst of laughter on the couch is especially pristine) but I never thought she particularly deserved an Oscar nomination for it.  In fact, the fragility of Macdonald's naivety or the inner rumblings of Watson's guilt were, in my opinion, much more deserving of mention.  That said, the only actress here that really can tango with Mirren is Kristen Scott Thomas, the jilted wife and fiery staccato of a woman.  I love the coldness she brings to her every movement, and that sensual awkwardness (there is a lanky stiffness to her movements that I adore, for they instantly create naturalness within her character).  She really understood how to make the most of her screen time.  Now, while she doesn't actually have the emotional punch of Mirren's character, I still feel that Thomas's performance has the slight edge.I would watch her pace a room before I'd watch anyone else.So, in the end I highly recommend this.  I know I toted this as Altman's finest (and I know that the devoted Altman fan may totally fight me on this) but coming from a man who is not an Altman supporter in the definitive sense, I'd say that that statement is pretty solid.  I still fall back and forth between this and `Short Cuts', which is sheer brilliance, but both films are SO different that it is really hard to compare and or judge.  Personally, at this very moment, if I had to chose between the two (as in which film I'd rather sit down and watch right now), I'd go with `Gosford Park'.",5,So much depth within those whispers...,1263427200,"01 14, 2010",2010,4893,"['more', 'chew', 'Gosford', 'Park', 'more', ""'m"", 'convinced', 'may', 'very', 'well', 'be', 'Altman', 'best', 'film', 'Sure', 'have', ""n't"", 'seen', 'lot', 'films', ""'m"", 'not', 'really', 'all', 'too', 'keen', 'style', 'director', 'screenwriter', 'acquired', 'taste', 'said', 'style', ""n't"", 'work', 'time', 'film', 'really', 'truly', 'impressive', 'way', 'best', 'thing', 'film', 'very', 'well', 'first', 'time', 'saw', 'film', 'merely', 'liked', 'time', 'memory', 'film', 'only', 'better', 'recent', 'viewings', 'become', 'apparent', 'particular', 'social', 'commentary', 'only', 'better', 'better', 'time.When', 'Gosford', 'Park', 'mentioned', 'usually', 'first', 'conversation', 'hinges', 'cast', 'more', 'specifically', 'large', 'female', 'cast', ""'m"", 'going', 'save', 'last.It', '1932', 'are', 'large', 'very', 'large', 'country', 'house', 'England', 'A', 'group', 'sophisticated', 'socialites', 'have', 'gathered', 'together', 'shooting', 'party', 'almost', 'instantaneously', 'distinctions', 'are', 'made', 'parties', 'divide', 'wealthy', 'lackadaisical', 'meanderings', 'servants', 'countless', 'duties', 'twist', 'Clue', 'proportions', 'thrown', 'man', 'very', 'prominent', 'figure', 'up', 'dead', 'just', 'everyone', 'suspect.For', 'anyone', 'who', 'delved', 'Altman', 'work', 'layered', 'texture', 'films', 'script', 'will', 'not', 'come', 'shock', 'very', 'beginning', 'career', 'Altman', 'built', 'films', 'brisk', 'yet', 'complex', 'interchange', 'dialog', 'film', 'may', 'be', 'best', 'fit', 'Altman', 'use', 'words', 'ability', 'capture', 'so', 'much', 'mere', 'glimpse', 'individual', 'communications', 'LARGE', 'ensemble', 'cast', 'confine', 'corners', 'whispering', 'knowledge', 'one', 'trying', 'heartily', 'solve', 'mystery', 'Altman', 'profound', 'engrossing', 'study', 'humanity', 'have', 'mentioned', 'film', 'really', 'layers', 'human', 'complexity', 'fleshing', 'out', 'motives', 'actions', 'words', 'very', 'inner', 'workings', 'move', 'action', 'dismiss', 'film', 'ever', 'really', 'giving', 'chance', 'sink', 'minds.I', 'almost', 'did.I', ""'m"", 'thrilled', 'Oscar', 'handed', 'out', 'screenplay', 'award', 'film', 'really', 'very', 'complex', 'yet', 'attainable', 'work', 'art', 'way', 'Altman', 'breathily', 'character', 'character', 'just', 'camera', 'swoons', 'room', 'just', 'breathtaking', 'truly', 'real', 'people', 'so', 'tightly', 'woven', 'yet', 'briskly', 'realized', 'collection', 'conversations', 'relay', 'fragility', 'human', 'frailty', 'ever', 'losing', 'earnestness', 'humor', 'needed', 'create', 'something', 'fresh', 'entertaining.And', 'now', 'get', 'ladies.I', ""'m"", 'going', 'start', 'listing', 'off', 'Maggie', 'Smith', 'Helen', 'Mirren', 'Kristen', 'Scott', 'Thomas', 'Kelly', 'Macdonald', 'Emily', 'Watson', 'are', 'just', 'big', 'names', 'recognizable', 'really', 'do', 'make', 'biggest', 'impact', 'Mirren', 'Smith', 'were', 'Oscar', 'nominated', 'were', 'outstanding', 'respective', 'roles', 'Mirren', 'doubt', 'better', 'two', 'tortured', 'yet', 'commanding', 'presence', 'perfectly', 'not', 'only', 'character', 'social', 'standing', 'servitude', 'very', 'reminiscent', 'Hopkin', 'astonishing', 'turn', 'Remains', 'Day', 'also', 'inner', 'soul', 'person', 'removed', 'manipulated', 'impressions', 'love', 'what', 'Smith', 'here', 'sudden', 'burst', 'laughter', 'couch', 'especially', 'pristine', 'never', 'thought', 'particularly', 'deserved', 'Oscar', 'nomination', 'fact', 'fragility', 'Macdonald', 'naivety', 'inner', 'rumblings', 'Watson', 'guilt', 'were', 'opinion', 'much', 'more', 'deserving', 'mention', 'said', 'only', 'actress', 'here', 'really', 'can', 'tango', 'Mirren', 'Kristen', 'Scott', 'Thomas', 'jilted', 'wife', 'fiery', 'staccato', 'woman', 'love', 'coldness', 'movement', 'sensual', 'awkwardness', 'lanky', 'stiffness', 'movements', 'adore', 'instantly', 'create', 'naturalness', 'character', 'really', 'understood', 'how', 'make', 'most', 'screen', 'time', 'Now', ""n't"", 'actually', 'have', 'emotional', 'punch', 'Mirren', 'character', 'still', 'feel', 'Thomas', 'performance', 'slight', 'edge.I', 'would', 'watch', 'pace', 'room', ""'d"", 'watch', 'anyone', 'else.So', 'end', 'highly', 'recommend', 'know', 'toted', 'Altman', 'finest', 'know', 'devoted', 'Altman', 'fan', 'may', 'totally', 'fight', 'coming', 'man', 'who', 'not', 'Altman', 'supporter', 'definitive', 'sense', ""'d"", 'say', 'statement', 'pretty', 'solid', 'still', 'fall', 'back', 'forth', 'Short', 'Cuts', 'sheer', 'brilliance', 'films', 'are', 'SO', 'different', 'really', 'hard', 'compare', 'judge', 'Personally', 'very', 'moment', 'had', 'chose', 'two', 'film', ""'d"", 'rather', 'sit', 'down', 'watch', 'right', 'now', ""'d"", 'go', 'Gosford', 'Park']",N/A
589948,A1F7YU6O5RU432,B00005JKNF,Angela Streiff,"[0, 0]","I found Gosford Park to be brilliant. I would describe it as combination of a British upstairs/downstairs story line combined with a Clue murder mystery.A calm and mellow paced movie, it plays out with a lot of soft spoken talking and small chit-chat that at first you don't necessarily realize is crucial to the movie plot. While watching a scene, you will find that there is often much going on silently in the background. This is where watching the movie over and over comes into play. Once you know the ending and all of the crucial elements to the story, you can enjoy watching it again and catching all kinds of things going on in the background that you don't notice the first time around.Many different smaller stories unfold for each of the characters throughout the movie. The more times you watch it, you will even discover small stories within larger stories. These smaller plots then all tie into the main murder mystery story. The scenes are almost always filled with many people all together in a room at the same time, so there is always a lot going on to pay attention to.There's a small amount of cursing, no nudity and a few scenes of implied intimacy. There is nothing crude or tasteless that has been added. The majority of the movie is dialogue, no dramatic rescues or heart-pounding chases.

589950,ARA48345JZPZR,B00005JKNF,Archmaker,"[2, 5]","I confess to being a Robert Altman fan.  I love most of his work (but not all).  I found this to be a thoroughly entertaining and enjoyable film and I recommend it to people who enjoy non-linear, non-Hollywood films.  This is a dream cast of the best of British actors, going through their paces in a delicious satire/social comedy/mystery delineating in great detail the different lives of the different classes in 1930's England.This is Upstairs/Downstairs with attitude!  These Downstairs servants are neither in love with or in awe of their social ""betters"" Upstairs.  Far from it!  They find their Lords & Masters for the most part silly, stupid, vain, dull and penny-pinching cheapskates ( especially when it comes to paying their Serving class, at any rate).We get to observe and contrast the two classes throughout the course of the film:  the Upstairs at play, busily screwing each other both literally and figuratively, while, the Downstairs lot work like the devil to keep these precious Aristos in ease and comfort.  All of this done in typical Altman understatement and casual, almost throwaway observation & dialogue.I found the period detail wonderful, and the wit droll and precise.  As I said, it is a dream cast of the cream of British acting so everyone is spot-on.I will admit the dialogue and sound can be difficult to catch, what with the accents and all.  Here's a suggestion: it's a DVD, put on the hearing impaired captions.  I did, so that I wouldn't miss a single bit of dialogue.And finally, I am glad the murder mystery resolved itself the way it did.

Gosford Park was tabbed as a murder mystery. I waited and waited, listened and listened, and yawned and yawned for that to come. Quickly, I had become addicted to checking the timer. Sometimes, two minutes have passed by...sometimes three...sometimes one...and, to my frustration, sometimes none. Gosford Park was interminably long and tedious. By the time, a murder had been committed; the director already lost me for good. When the mystery had been solved, I just wanted to sleep. All in all, Gosford Park was one of the most BORING movies I've seen in my life, and it lulled me to four separate naps over three days. By the way, congratulations to Ryan Phillippe...he had won the worst actor of the decade award.

Some will think it moves too slow, some will think there's not enough action, and some will not want to keep up with all the characters.  That's too bad, but for those who stick with it, 'Gosford Park' will be a wonderful movie experience.The plot is simple.  In November, 1932, Sir William McCordle (Michael Gambon) has invited friends and family to his country estate for a hunting weekend.  Everyone arrives with his or her baggage, physical and emotional.  Director Altman expertly allows the viewer to eavesdrop on bits and pieces of seemingly random conversations that serve not so much to give us plot information, but to give us an insight into the characters and their lives.  And to pave the way for murder.The first half of the film is a brilliant look at the rich and their servants.  The attendants are often treated as part of the furniture.  Often the wealthy guests carry on intimate conversations among themselves with the servants clearly in earshot.  But they are servants, their job is to serve, not to report conversations.  But when the rich are alone with their servants, they confide in them and share information they would never share with anyone else.  Altman does a masterful job of showing us that even though this is an English estate from 70 years past, things really haven't changed much.Many excellent characters are present in the film.  Sir William seems bored with the charade of hosting this event and seems to want to spend time only with his dog and his mistress.  The feelings are mostly mutual.  His dog seems to be the only one present who really loves him.  Bob Balaban is wonderful as American movie director Morris Weissman, who is more concerned about filming his next Charlie Chan movie than the real-life murder right under his nose.While all these character revelations are important and fascinating, they do go on perhaps a bit longer than they should.  After all, the film is past the halfway point before the murder is even committed.  But as the film moves closer towards the conclusion, viewers will begin to piece together all the information presented during the first hour to find a solution.  I would almost say that the solution is not as important as the journey getting there, but it is important because of its power.In watching the film, I almost thought that the movie did not deserve the R rating.  The rating was put there for some language and some very brief [love] situations, but probably to help define the audience.  Kids would probably not enjoy the film at all.  The same could probably be said for action-crazed teenagers.  However, if you enjoy interesting characters portrayed by a stellar cast in the hands of a masterful director, 'Gosford Park' is for you.

Fellowes comments, however, are wonderful insight to the history of English country house weekends, the arrogance of classism in British social history, as well as providing delightful rememberances of the author's own relations from whom he drew heavily developing his characters.This is a film of seamless performances from every actor and underscores the strength of theatrical training in the British system over Hollywood's studio celebrity system.  A little bit Agetha Christie, but not really, the story of a dismal weekend in the country is made all the better by Altman's direction, or ability to direct without interference in his actor's performances.Stellar performances include Maggie Smith (Prime of Miss Jean Brody), delightful as the Countess without a pot to p*#s in, Michael Gambon (The Singing Detective), the victim of greedy in-laws and dog-haters, Jeremy Northam as Ivor Novello delivers blissful musical entertainment to guests and audience alike, Emily Watson (Metroland) demonstrates why she is one of the best young actors working today, and Helen Mirren and Clive Owen are mysterious players in the upstairs-downstairs dilemma.  The depth of cast talent is akin to an archaeology dig, it just keeps getting better as time passes.Gosford Park is a film that makes film watching a pleasure.

589959,ALR35EFI69S5R,B00005JKNF,"Barron Laycock ""Labradorman""","[8, 13]","Over the years, Robert Altman has proved as elusive as his films to classify or to try to get the definitive pulse from. His films are at once quite focused and yet all over the place. The predominating feature of each of the films is that it is an attempt to define and describe a kind of insane little aspect of the world, as in ""MASH"", ""The Player"", or  ""Nashville"".  He seems intrigued by the way in which earnestness and sophistry pass through the lens of every observer, so that while we believe we are viewing something in all due reference, he is poking fun at our attempt. Yet he is still standing there next to us, peering through that same small knothole and straining to try to understand whatever it is that is going inside that small space we can see beyond the wooden wall.For Altman, life is messy and hard to discern, and a lot of the dialogue in his films suffer from the same level of noise and discord. Yet no one seems as uniquely capable at capturing all of the noisome nuances of human interaction in its full range of pathos and progress than does Altman. As in MASH, his depiction of the nature of life in an English ""cottage"" is a masterpiece of such imaginings. The cast here is superb, including Maggie Smith, Jeremy Northam, and Kristin Scott Thomas as the rulers of this limited universe, as well as others such as Kelly MacDonald, Alan Bates, Helen Mirren, and Clive Owen as the working class stiffs just trying to scheme their way through the day.Altman pokes great fun at both sides of the socioeconomic divide, and it is the nature of the class-ordained behavior that provides the foundation for this look at life in the English countryside. While it has commonly been observed before that a hard a difficult life has its rewards, especially allowing for a more realistic appreciation of the gifts of life, never has it been done so gracefully, imaginatively, and with such roaring good humor and repartee as here.  Certainly, Altman's fondness for noise and chaos furthers this search for the truth in the situation as nothing else could. The film is entertaining, worthwhile, and extremely well done. I highly recommend it.

I know it won awards, but so do most movies starring Tom Hanks, and I'm sorry, but if that's the official arbiter of excellence, I'll just stay home. Anyway, I read the back of the DVD and figured it would be one of those films that I'd find boring on first viewing, yet gradually begin to appreciate if I bothered with it any further.Well, it IS rather ""dry."" I found it odd that Altman claims that the ""F-word"" was deliberately insinuated into the script a sufficient number of times to secure an R rating - supposedly to keep teenage boys with too much testosterone from seeing ""Gosford Park."" I should think the testosterone itself would do the job. Nothing explodes in this film, there's nary a lick of that crazy rock music the kids like, nobody gets killed...oh wait, somebody does get killed, but even the murder scene is impossibly dull and boring. Bloodless, antiseptic, British.This is an ""adult"" film in the true sense. This is a film about adult social politics and intrigue and gossip, about the strange edgy relationship between these indefatiguably haughty upper-crust aristocrats and the ever-complacent servants they depend upon for every least personal function, yet whom they openly revile as congenitally inferior. It would be rash to presume that the plush and pampered ""Upstairs"" life is really any easier psychologically than the cramped and calloused ""Downstairs"" life, however. ""Gosford Park"" is an interesting investigation of what happens when the constraints and tabus of this sort of caste system render the lives of everyone involved practically intolerable. The servants have been just as thoroughly conditioned to automatic submission as outright slaves. Their entire existence is drudgery; their only dignity is vicarious; they acquire the pretensions and snobberies of their masters and often turn viciously and hypocritically on one another. Yet the aristocrats themselves, who never have to flex a muscle for the most trifling amenity, have been driven by inevitable boredom and inertia to likewise ruthlessly intrigue against each other purely to while away the time and maintain the status-quo. Their insanely regulated and mannered lifestyle is as nigh impossible for them to embody as it is for their servants to set up. As such, everybody all-around is miserable, conspiratory, two-faced, paranoid, vindictive, jealous, insecure, chasing after an ideal which can never be realized. This social climate is the perfect breeding ground for every sort of moral dis-ease.Nice craft on everybody's part really nails this home. Each actor - from Maggie Smith as an excruciatingly pompous, impudent, willfully-helpless old mummy of a Lady, to Sir William McCordle as a fat, nasty, overbearing slob, to Kristen Scott Thomas as a harsh, withering, jaded, manipulative Marlene Dietrich doppelganger - was fitted with an individual mic so that multiple simultaneous conversations in a scene could be recorded and then mixed to allow salient bits to come through in the final cut. This invests ""Gosford Park"" with a certain realism and allows the viewer to feel like an invisible voyeur wandering amongst these complicated proceedings and catching both relevant and irrelevant snippets.Am I recommending it? I suppose I am. I did enjoy this film precisely because I'm the type that tends to get caught up in the minutiae of period customs and conventions, which are evidently rendered with exacting accuracy in ""Gosford.""

589964,A82MLYSUUU3CF,B00005JKNF,"Bil Antoniou ""Movie madness!""","[5, 7]","Robert Altman's experimental style of throwing a giant ensemble cast into a situation and seeing what they make of it pays off in great measure with this delightful comedy about a giant British manor that is host to many zany guests of different temperaments and personalities. Kristin Scott Thomas and Michael Gambon are the lord and lady of the manor who are entertaining their various relatives and friends for a week-long shooting party, while the servants below stairs clamor to keep up with all the required serving and dressing duties under the direction of the head housekeeper (Helen Mirren). Altman's free-flowing camera follows both the above and under-stairs action until it all comes to a head when a prominent member of the party is murdered by an unknown assailant. Here is where the film takes its most delicious turn: instead of focusing on the mechanics of the murder or concentrating on divulging clues to the audience, the story instead focuses on the reactions by all the other cast members, most hilariously the fact that only one member of the cast, that is the sexy maid played by Emily Watson, actually mourns the deceased. Those looking for a good Mouse Trap-style comedy better rent Clue instead, because this one dispenses of its gumshoe duties early in the investigation process, kicks up its heels and has a great time laughing at its participants. If you're in the mood, or if you're a big fan of the wonderful actors involved, you will too. Kelly Macdonald is perfectly delightful as a visiting servant who lovingly observes the goings-on of the house and brings the plot to its head, and Maggie Smith is a standout as the disgustingly snobbish aunt to Scott Thomas, but probably the most effective performance in the film comes from Mirren-this woman amazes you with the very way she poises herself, ready for duty. The film comfortably resides somewhere just below Nashville or Short Cuts and well above Dr. T and the Women, and unlike Dr. T, the more openly-filmed, improvised scenes blend in seamlessly with the carefully scripted ones, and one can only admire Altman for this immense amount of control that he's shown in his direction with this film.",5,An Altman Experiment That Works!,1041811200,"01 6, 2003",2003,2187,"['Robert', 'Altman', 'experimental', 'style', 'throwing', 'giant', 'ensemble', 'cast', 'situation', 'seeing', 'what', 'make', 'great', 'measure', 'delightful', 'comedy', 'giant', 'British', 'manor', 'host', 'many', 'zany', 'guests', 'different', 'temperaments', 'personalities', 'Kristin', 'Scott', 'Thomas', 'Michael', 'Gambon', 'are', 'lord', 'lady', 'manor', 'who', 'are', 'entertaining', 'various', 'relatives', 'friends', 'week-long', 'shooting', 'party', 'servants', 'stairs', 'clamor', 'keep', 'up', 'required', 'serving', 'dressing', 'duties', 'direction', 'head', 'housekeeper', 'Helen', 'Mirren', 'Altman', 'free-flowing', 'camera', 'above', 'under-stairs', 'action', 'head', 'when', 'prominent', 'member', 'party', 'murdered', 'unknown', 'assailant', 'Here', 'where', 'film', 'most', 'delicious', 'turn', 'instead', 'focusing', 'mechanics', 'murder', 'concentrating', 'divulging', 'clues', 'audience', 'story', 'instead', 'reactions', 'other', 'cast', 'members', 'most', 'hilariously', 'fact', 'only', 'one', 'member', 'cast', 'sexy', 'maid', 'played', 'Emily', 'Watson', 'actually', 'deceased', 'looking', 'good', 'Mouse', 'Trap-style', 'comedy', 'better', 'rent', 'Clue', 'instead', 'one', 'gumshoe', 'duties', 'early', 'investigation', 'process', 'up', 'heels', 'great', 'time', 'laughing', 'participants', ""'re"", 'mood', ""'re"", 'big', 'fan', 'wonderful', 'actors', 'involved', 'will', 'too', 'Kelly', 'Macdonald', 'perfectly', 'delightful', 'visiting', 'servant', 'who', 'lovingly', 'goings-on', 'house', 'plot', 'head', 'Maggie', 'Smith', 'standout', 'disgustingly', 'snobbish', 'aunt', 'Scott', 'Thomas', 'probably', 'most', 'effective', 'performance', 'film', 'Mirren-this', 'woman', 'very', 'way', 'ready', 'duty', 'film', 'comfortably', 'somewhere', 'just', 'Nashville', 'Short', 'Cuts', 'well', 'Dr.', 'T', 'Women', 'Dr.', 'T', 'more', 'openly-filmed', 'improvised', 'scenes', 'blend', 'seamlessly', 'carefully', 'scripted', 'ones', 'one', 'can', 'only', 'admire', 'Altman', 'immense', 'amount', 'control', 'shown', 'direction', 'film']",N/A

The character driven story is made believable through his unique style. Especially the dialogue, which bears his trademark clatter, chatter, and ambient noise, really gives the impression that we are in a real, busy household with lots of things to take care of and all the rest of it. You really have to concentrate to hear what they are all saying, and still you're probably going to miss some things. Yet this is what makes the film work so well. It plays on the gossip that drives both the upper and the lower classes. On the rumours, the hearsay, the beliefs.The writing of course is equally good. Great characters and witty dialogue.

While some reviewers seem to have expected a murder mystery, I approached this film with no expectations whatsoever beyond its reputation as a critically acclaimed film.  What I got was a mostly well-executed Robert Altman film, with all his idiosyncracies, and what I ended up with was too much of a good thing.  As for the mystery, the film is over halfway complete before it happens, as there's too much setup and character development; this is generally a good thing but only if the characters are really interesting.  Altman's most memorable work (""M*A*S*H,"" ""Nashville,"" ""Popeye,"" and even ""The Player"") has far more interesting and well-defined characters than ""Gosford Park,"" which is a serious flaw.It's another huge ensemble cast piece, my favorite performance (easily) being that of grand old Dame Maggie Smith, looking every one of her 66 years and then some.  God bless her for not having tons of ""work done,"" unlike so many plastic-faced plastic people in showbiz.  A well-deserved Oscar nomination for best supporting actress for Madame Smith, as well as for Helen Mirren.  As is typical of Altman's work, this huge cast mingles and interacts well, hard to see which bits are ad libs and which are plot points because they all tend to build in the direction needed to carry the story; some lovely and memorable moments, such as the maids dancing outside the party to the music being played inside for the upper crust.For all of Altman's style and well-deserved reputation, I had a hard time sticking out this overly long drama.  For one thing, I'm mystified that the word ""comedy"" is attached to this film in any respect; I found no humor other than the idiot police inspector, the most moronic such character since Clouseau; while Peter Sellers was funny, however, here the character is just a nuisance, a one-line joke gone on too long.  It's also a problem with all Altman films that his method makes the dialogue very, very hard to follow, and often hard to even hear; sure, I'm all for the realism of overlapping dialogue, but the helter-skelter method of hiding mikes and cameras to catch actors ad libbing, in order to splice together a story later, results in too much off-mike echo of voices, rustling of costumes, etc., hard to hear what's going on.  I always feel like I'm missing something when watching an Altman film, and that's irritating because his films are generally interesting; this one certainly is.Credit where credit is due; the story takes some unexpected turns and has a pip of an ending.  I just would've liked to have a program so I could tell the players one from the other, and a transcript in the other hand to see what was being said much of the time.  I think I have better ways to spend future 2-1/2 hour chunks of my life.",3,The butler didn't do it,1110844800,"03 15, 2005",2005,2867,"['be', 'love', 'hate', 'film', 'feel', 'odd', 'be', 'right', 'middle', 'here', 'reviewers', 'seem', 'have', 'expected', 'murder', 'mystery', 'approached', 'film', 'expectations', 'whatsoever', 'reputation', 'critically', 'acclaimed', 'film', 'What', 'got', 'was', 'mostly', 'well-executed', 'Robert', 'Altman', 'film', 'idiosyncracies', 'what', 'ended', 'up', 'was', 'too', 'much', 'good', 'thing', 'mystery', 'film', 'halfway', 'complete', 'too', 'much', 'setup', 'character', 'development', 'generally', 'good', 'thing', 'only', 'characters', 'are', 'really', 'interesting', 'Altman', 'most', 'memorable', 'work', 'M*A*S*H', 'Nashville', 'Popeye', 'even', 'Player', 'far', 'more', 'interesting', 'well-defined', 'characters', 'Gosford', 'Park', 'serious', 'flaw.It', 'huge', 'ensemble', 'cast', 'piece', 'favorite', 'performance', 'easily', 'being', 'grand', 'old', 'Dame', 'Maggie', 'Smith', 'looking', 'one', '66', 'years', 'then', 'God', 'not', 'having', 'tons', 'work', 'done', 'so', 'many', 'plastic-faced', 'plastic', 'people', 'showbiz', 'well-deserved', 'Oscar', 'nomination', 'best', 'supporting', 'actress', 'Madame', 'Smith', 'as', 'well', 'Helen', 'Mirren', 'As', 'typical', 'Altman', 'work', 'huge', 'cast', 'mingles', 'interacts', 'well', 'hard', 'see', 'bits', 'are', 'ad', 'libs', 'are', 'plot', 'points', 'tend', 'build', 'direction', 'needed', 'carry', 'story', 'lovely', 'memorable', 'moments', 'such', 'maids', 'dancing', 'party', 'music', 'being', 'played', 'upper', 'crust.For', 'Altman', 'style', 'well-deserved', 'reputation', 'had', 'hard', 'time', 'sticking', 'out', 'overly', 'long', 'drama', 'one', 'thing', ""'m"", 'mystified', 'word', 'comedy', 'attached', 'film', 'respect', 'found', 'humor', 'other', 'idiot', 'police', 'inspector', 'most', 'moronic', 'such', 'character', 'Clouseau', 'Peter', 'Sellers', 'was', 'funny', 'however', 'here', 'character', 'just', 'nuisance', 'one-line', 'joke', 'gone', 'too', 'long', 'also', 'problem', 'Altman', 'films', 'method', 'dialogue', 'very', 'very', 'hard', 'follow', 'often', 'hard', 'even', 'hear', 'sure', ""'m"", 'realism', 'overlapping', 'dialogue', 'helter-skelter', 'method', 'hiding', 'mikes', 'cameras', 'catch', 'actors', 'ad', 'libbing', 'order', 'splice', 'together', 'story', 'later', 'results', 'too', 'much', 'off-mike', 'echo', 'voices', 'rustling', 'costumes', 'etc.', 'hard', 'hear', 'what', 'going', 'always', 'feel', ""'m"", 'missing', 'something', 'when', 'watching', 'Altman', 'film', 'irritating', 'films', 'are', 'generally', 'interesting', 'one', 'certainly', 'where', 'credit', 'due', 'story', 'unexpected', 'turns', 'pip', 'ending', 'just', 'would', ""'ve"", 'liked', 'have', 'program', 'could', 'tell', 'players', 'one', 'other', 'transcript', 'other', 'hand', 'see', 'what', 'was', 'being', 'said', 'much', 'time', 'think', 'have', 'better', 'ways', 'spend', 'future', '2-1/2', 'hour', 'chunks', 'life']",N/A

I likened the Weissman character to Altman himself - the American auteur who decides, for a kick, to dabble in the world of ineffectual British aristocrats.But you can't go wrong with such a stellar cast, all of whom are obviously having a hell of a good time making the film.

Though it's touted as an Agatha  Christie-style murder mystery, the murder itself doesn't even happen until well into the movie, and the movie has moved so slowly up to that point that it almost seems like just another irrelevant (lack of) plot point.

These two elements are exemplified in the funny, mannered performance of Jeremy Northam as Ivor Novello, singing Novello's popular and ickily sentimental songs (although Her Mother Came, Too is still amusing). I can't think of a performance in the movie that wasn't first rate, including those by the two Americans, Bob Balaban and Ryan Phillippe. Well, maybe Stephen Fry.Even the heavy-going plot lines, which could easily have sunk into melodrama, are rescued by the performances of Mirren, Atkins, Watson, Bates, etc. And the bit players also were outstanding. I especially liked the chubby young scullery helper. I just hope she didn't get pregnant...and that she always washed her hands before helping out with the carrots.Altman, for me, has made so many movies of such varying quality that it's hard to figure out where to place him.

It&#8217;s booked as a murder mystery, but it&#8217;s really an education on the upstairs/downstairs world of the aristocracy and their servants. This movie has a huge, all-star cast and it&#8217;s a loving homage to a lost time and place: the pre-war country estate of formal dinner, fox hunts, and drawing rooms. The story surrounds the McCordle family. The patriarch is rich, titled, and surrounded by relatives for a shooting party. He pulls at everyone&#8217;s strings because they&#8217;re dependent upon his largesse in some form or another. The attendants are at his estate for a weekend of shooting and every one is on edge because they all want something from him. The more interesting part of the story is in the lives of the servants. They are equally as invested in the lives of their masters and can move freely around the house because the guests speak freely in front of them, almost as if they don&#8217;t exist. While the movie is ostensibly about the murder of the patriarch, said murder doesn&#8217;t occur until well past the first half of the movie. A detective comes, everyone is asked to stay, and everyone wonders who may have done it. The guests assume it is likely a thief, the detective assumes it must be a guest (since no servant has enough invested to commit such a crime) but one maid discovers the truth. The lead housekeeper did it in order to prevent her son, one of the guest&#8217;s valet&#8217;s from committing the crime, and he did it because he is the illegitimate son of the victim. While the revelation was interesting, the movie kept my interest because of the variety of subplots: the unfaithful wife, the hollywood director who wants a peek into the aristocracy, and the whole host of hungry relatives nipping at the hand of their benefactor.

A group of upper-class British society types and their hangers-on gather at a country estate for a weekend of shooting. During the course of the weekend, the lord of the manor is killed and a rather bumbling detective comes in to investigate the crime.Sounds like something you've seen before, doesn't it? Well, the brilliance of the film comes in the fact that the story focuses on the various servants--valets, cooks, butlers, etc.--who make up the ""below stairs"" society in the house. We see those above stairs through their eyes, as well as the comings and goings related to the murder investigation. The actual murder isn't really solved per se, though we know who did it by film's end. What really matters are the interactions between people and the exploration of this little-seen society, in which social hierarchy is just as important, if not more so, than in the above stairs world.The DVD has some excellent extras--an extended sequence of deleted scenes, with insightful commentary regarding why they were cut; an interesting behind-the-scenes documentary on the making of the film; a brief look at the accuracy of the film--they actually tracked down a head cook, a butler, and a ladies' serving maid who acted as consultants to make sure the actors were realistic; and a great question and answer sequence that catches several of the cast and crew following a special screening of the film.

590004,A1S1O3YT8NS68A,B00005JKNF,crazyforgems,"[1, 2]","""Gosford Park"" is perfect for the dvd medium.A murder mystery set in the early 1930's in a mansion in England, more than a dozen main characters (and a number of other supporting ones) flit by you in the first few minutes. Even for the most die-hard movie viewer, there is a lot to keep track of throughout the movie.First and foremost, the plot: a group of well-born (and some not so well-born) Englishmen and women gather with their servants for a weekend house party. Of course, the inevitable murder takes place and the inevitable investigation ensues. However, the murder is in many ways the least interesting thing about this movie. The movie really focuses on the English class structure and the clean break between those ""upstairs"" and those ""downstairs."" Emily Watson and Helen Mirren will break your heart as two of the more poignant members of the downstairs. As for the upstairs-ah, well, that's really where the murder is taking place-not of an individual, but slowly of an entire class.When you see the movie several times, you can enjoy different aspects of it. The dialogue is quick and clever. The performances are for the most part, outstanding.(When you have an ensemble of this size, you're bound to have an off performance or two).The DVD is outstanding. It features two different voice over ttracks of the film-one from director Altman and one from the writer.I would recommend this movie to lovers of Bob Altman, of English murder mysteries, of serious films with higher purposes.",5,"An Excellent Movie, An Outstanding DVD",1054684800,"06 4, 2003",2003,1503,"['Gosford', 'Park', 'perfect', 'dvd', 'medium.A', 'murder', 'mystery', 'set', 'early', '1930', 'mansion', 'England', 'more', 'dozen', 'main', 'characters', 'number', 'other', 'supporting', 'ones', 'flit', 'first', 'few', 'minutes', 'Even', 'most', 'die-hard', 'movie', 'viewer', 'lot', 'keep', 'track', 'movie.First', 'foremost', 'plot', 'group', 'well-born', 'not', 'well-born', 'Englishmen', 'women', 'gather', 'servants', 'weekend', 'house', 'party', 'course', 'inevitable', 'murder', 'place', 'inevitable', 'investigation', 'ensues', 'However', 'murder', 'many', 'ways', 'least', 'interesting', 'thing', 'movie', 'movie', 'really', 'English', 'class', 'structure', 'clean', 'break', 'upstairs', 'downstairs', 'Emily', 'Watson', 'Helen', 'Mirren', 'will', 'break', 'heart', 'two', 'more', 'poignant', 'members', 'downstairs', 'upstairs-ah', 'well', 'really', 'where', 'murder', 'taking', 'place-not', 'individual', 'slowly', 'entire', 'class.When', 'see', 'movie', 'several', 'times', 'can', 'enjoy', 'different', 'aspects', 'dialogue', 'quick', 'clever', 'performances', 'are', 'most', 'part', 'outstanding', 'When', 'have', 'ensemble', 'size', ""'re"", 'bound', 'have', 'off', 'performance', 'two', '.The', 'DVD', 'outstanding', 'two', 'different', 'voice', 'ttracks', 'film-one', 'director', 'Altman', 'one', 'writer.I', 'would', 'recommend', 'movie', 'lovers', 'Bob', 'Altman', 'English', 'murder', 'mysteries', 'serious', 'films', 'higher', 'purposes']",N/A

590006,A28WJUJF6D2ULA,B00005JKNF,Dai-keag-ity,"[2, 2]","Robert Altman had in Gosford Park a film unlike any I for one associate with this legendary director.  Stepping away from his usual canvas and setting foot confidently in England of the 1930's, Altman gets a lot of use out a large, capable cast that he no doubt drew together in part on the strength of who he was as a filmmaker. Telling its tale of a days-long gathering for a shooting party on a country estate, and doing a fine job of depicting the immensity of complications such events impose on the lives of those who truly bring it all together, the serving classes, Altman makes use of a slick and subtle inside joke in that every scene of the movie takes place only when at least one servant is in the shot. What starts off as a depiction of the logistics concerning the feeding, lodging, and care of an already by the `30's vaguely anachronistic gathering of upper-crust English society types gradually becomes instead a murder mystery a la Agatha Christie at her best. Far less about the people ""upstairs"" than the more personally substantial folk below, Gosford Park reveals itself degree by degree until revelations about furtive love, buried secrets, smoldering hatred, and hot-blooded murder come to light. It all makes for a complicated, understated, deceptively British-seeming film, and it is calls out for a closer second viewing soon after the first time it is seen.",5,Servants Are The True Soul Of Any Great House,1170806400,"02 7, 2007",2007,1386,"['Robert', 'Altman', 'had', 'Gosford', 'Park', 'film', 'one', 'associate', 'legendary', 'director', 'Stepping', 'away', 'usual', 'canvas', 'setting', 'foot', 'confidently', 'England', '1930', 'Altman', 'lot', 'use', 'large', 'capable', 'cast', 'doubt', 'drew', 'together', 'part', 'strength', 'who', 'was', 'filmmaker', 'Telling', 'tale', 'days-long', 'gathering', 'shooting', 'party', 'country', 'estate', 'doing', 'fine', 'job', 'depicting', 'immensity', 'complications', 'such', 'events', 'impose', 'lives', 'who', 'truly', 'bring', 'together', 'serving', 'classes', 'Altman', 'use', 'slick', 'subtle', 'inside', 'joke', 'scene', 'movie', 'place', 'only', 'when', 'least', 'one', 'servant', 'shot', 'What', 'off', 'depiction', 'logistics', 'concerning', 'feeding', 'lodging', 'care', 'already', '30', 'vaguely', 'anachronistic', 'gathering', 'upper-crust', 'English', 'society', 'types', 'gradually', 'instead', 'murder', 'mystery', 'la', 'Agatha', 'Christie', 'best', 'Far', 'less', 'people', 'upstairs', 'more', 'personally', 'substantial', 'folk', 'Gosford', 'Park', 'degree', 'degree', 'revelations', 'furtive', 'love', 'buried', 'secrets', 'smoldering', 'hatred', 'hot-blooded', 'murder', 'come', 'light', 'complicated', 'understated', 'deceptively', 'British-seeming', 'film', 'out', 'closer', 'second', 'viewing', 'soon', 'first', 'time', 'seen']",N/A

590009,A2HII4U9WQ0XUV,B00005JKNF,"Dark Mechanicus JSG ""Black Ops Teep""","[27, 53]","Robert Altman used to be a great director who wielded one mean camera.Now he's become a cinematic sadist looking for a masochistic victim. If you watch ""Gosford Park"", you're the victim, and Altman is the leather-clad gimp.""Gosford Park"", Robert Altman's self-referential and cleverer-than-thou deconstruction of Agatha Christie's great whodunits, is crammed to its Victorian manor home garrets with enough actors to stage a full-scale invasion of Normandy (and win!), obsessively detailed, and repulsively self-absorbed. This is a strange and decidedly post-modern mixture of all-Plot and no-Plot, a smirking deconstructionist manifesto masquerading as a 1930's murder mystery.""Gosford Park"" doesn't entertain, thrill, or amuse: it bores. It is a new twist on cinema, to be sure: the Movie as Torture Device.Roughly a million primary, secondary, and tertiary English characters and their servants converge on the remote English manor home of William and Sylvia McCordle (played in desperately work-manlike fashion by Michael Gambon and Kristin Scott Thomas, respectively) for an extended week-end of dining, mumbling, and grouse-shooting, with an extra serving of mumbling.Our battalion of mumblers, Upper and Lower Class, maneuver around and about the ornately appointed chambers and elegantly manicured grounds of the Victorian manse, wheedling and plotting and whispering and, of course, mumbling. Elderly dame Constance Trentham (played acutely by Maggie Smith, who could do this sort of period dance in her sleep by now, and probably did) wheels whispering about the dining room and parlor of the estate, worrying about status and couth.The hapless Meredith couple (Tom Hollander, Natasha Wightman, turning in fine roles as middle-class mumblers) are trying to wrangle a deal with the elderly, grumbling, blackhearted Lord McCordle. Lady Sylvia (Thomas) is wan, capricious, fickle and unhappy; Lord William (Gambon) is bellicose, loud, and rugose.Everyone is unhappy. Everyone mumbles.Downstairs the staff mumble, but in Cockney accents, so whereas the Upper class mumbling is understandable, the soupy Yorkshire-to-Southwark gurgles will doubtless cause you to curse and demand subtitles. Alas, no help is forthcoming, and you'll spend a few minutes rewinding the DVD to try, desperately and futilely, to figure out what that First Footman said. Or was it the 4th Beater? Never mind. You'll be so absorbed muddling through the accents and the mumbling it won't really matter.There are a number of inevitable collisions between the gallant forces of Upstairs and the stolid and stoic servitors Downstairs as Things Come to a Head, portrayed through awkward pauses in dinnertime chit-chat (read: stilted mumbling punctuated by gasps) and startling revelations during tea-time at the McCordle Gazebo.None of this makes for an interesting movie. Indeed, it makes for something approximating Hell on Earth.""Gosford Park"" drowns in its own smug self-satisfaction, its endless mumbling, its dry-and-unaffected seminal murder sequence (presented almost as an afterthought), its muddle-headed and moronic Scotland Yard investigator (played foolishly by the great and underrated Stephen Fry, who sinks without a cry in this murky soup), and its anti-climactic ""conclusion"".This is not to say that the ""Gosford Park"" ship sinks without a mighty effort from its crew. The captain may be drunk at the helm, but the acting is terrific throughout, in spite of the mumbling: Dame Maggie Smith entrances as always, Kristin Scott Thomas does wonders with her thankless role, Michael Gambon rages and goes not softly into the dying of the Light, Helen Mirren is an oasis of dignity and desperate reserve, Derek Jacobi carves out precious little slices of the film and makes them his own, and the great Charles Dance and the inimitable Richard Grant do what they can with the material they have.I will also admit that the world of ""Gosford Park"" is handsomely mounted---like most dead wild beasts that have been shot and stuffed---and kudos go to Director of Photography Andrew Dunn (who stirred up the bewitching cinematography in ""The Madness of King George III"" and ""Count of Monte Cristo""), set designer Anna Pinnock (who moved on to ""Van Helsing"") and costume design by Jenny Beavan, (""Alexander"") and has about a million Jane Austen treatments under her belt. Everything looks smashing.Alas, ""smashing"" isn't the word that comes to mind about the larger work of ""Gosford Park"". 'Dull' is. For a movie that demands this much of its audience, ""Gosford Park"" really doesn't seem to care that much about its plot, its characters, or its resolution---and certainly not its audience.To those who want to see the British class system skewered, buy ""Upstairs/Downstairs"". To those looking for some ghoulishness mixed in with their rich Edwardian atmosphere, pick up ""Clue"" or ""The Private Life of Sherlock Holmes"".To those who want to lose more than two hours of their life to a mumbling, plotless, aimless and colorless British costume drama helmed by a director who has seen better days, pick up ""Gosford Park"". Just don't say you weren't warned in advance.I would rather have someone drive red-hot pokers into both of my eyes than ever watch this vile thing again.JSG",1,All Dressed up with Nowhere to

That transformed this film into a remarkable experience.  So much so I will be buying it to add to my collection.  The details and inticacies of the film and the story come alive as I listen to the writer explain how this story unfolds.  I know many will say that well the movie should be able to stand on its on and in a lot of ways it does.  But listening to the writer answer all the question I had in mind and even more was such a delight.  I recommend getting this movie on DVD just for that reason alone.  There are even more features that I did not get a chance to explore that I am sure will make it even better.

590015,AOYTQFRLD8VLP,B00005JKNF,Deborah Earle,"[0, 0]","In a screenplay by Julian Fellowes, and through the imaginations of Bob Balaban and the late director, Robert Altman, viewers find themselves transported to the upper crust society of 1932 England, where  the devious Sir William McCordle (Michael Gambon) and his elegant and aristocratic, but cold wife,Lady Sylvia(Kristen Scott Thomas) host variegated guests at their country estate for a weekend shooting party.Young Mary Maceachran(Kelly Macdonald)accompanies her employer, Constance, the Countess of Trenham (Dame Maggie Smith)to her niece's estate, encountering actor/singer/composer, Ivor Novello, Sir William's second cousin (an amiable and very gifted Jeremy Northam), on the road with friend and producer, Morris Weissman (a crude Bob Balaban) en route to the same destination.Others arriving at the estate on that rainy November day include the hostess' sisters Louisa and Lavinia(Geraldine Sommerville, Natasha Wightman) and Lord Stockbridge and Commander Meredith (Charles Dance and Tom Hollander). The McCordle's daughter Isobel (Camilla Rutherford), greets her suitor, Lord Rupert Standish (Lawrence Fox), who is accompanied by his friend, Mr. Jeremy Blond (Trent Ford). The Nesbitts, Freddie and Mabel (James Wilby and Claudey Blakely) are a couple who happen to be broke, and their relationship is tense and volatile.The butler, Jennings (Alan Bates) greets the guests at the entrance and directs the servants upon their arrival. Indoors, the downstairs set are directed by Mrs. Wilson ( Helen Mirren), the chief housekeeper. The other notable servants in this drama include Mrs. Croft (Eileen Atkins), Probst, the valet (Derek Jacobi), Robert Parks (a subtly charismatic Clive Owen) a gauche and mysterious Henry Denton(Ryan Phillippe)who tries to seduce Mary at one point, and head housemaid, Elsie (a hard-bitten Emily Watson), who, like more than one before her,  knows her employer quite intimately.During an afternoon tea, Novello finds himself at the receiving end of Constance's caustic views of his career, but also on the receiving end of Mabel's admiration.In the style and tradition of episodes of ""Mystery"" and ""Masterpiece Theater"", we are led through the upper crust rituals of formal dinners, games of pool, and the shooting party itself.After one of many scandalous  secrets is revealed, Novello is called to ease the tension by playing a few numbers. ""I Can Give You the Starlight"" was composed seven years after this story takes place. Yet despite this inaccuracy, I found myself glad it was included. The piano stylings of Jeremy Northam and/or his brother, Christopher liven things up more than a little, and the well-enunciated, Broadway-ish singing voice of the former, allegedly developed during a real-life stint as a singing waiter, is a pleasant one. Watching the servants dance to the distant sound of his tunes is priceless, emphasizing the spontaneous joy of the downstairs set.When the host is found dead in his study, with his ever-present dog close at hand, the reaction of those present is one of temporary stunned surprise and horror, even by the widow.Stephen Fry's Inspector Thompson is called in, along with assistant Constable Dexter (Ron Webster).While some tears are shed, generally, the crisis is met with stereotypical British reserve, as the widow and daughter entertain their guests clad in mourning. But more unflattering secrets about the departed are revealed, along with the pretentiousness of some of the upstairs set. Constable Dexter's summary of this world is one of dead-on precision: ""It's a poisonous paradise.""Soon, many of those involved find themselves making life-altering choices, and those unable to do so are left to new dilemmas and/or to their grief--not just over the deceased, but also in several instances, to issues pertaining to his treatement of them.The reprise of Novello's ""The Land of Might-Have-Been"" proves a fitting conclusion for the piece-- a sweet and sour slice of upper-crust life of a by-gone era, that makes fine viewing for quiet evenings in.",4,A Poisonous Paradise,1217635200,"08 2, 2008",2008,4044,"['screenplay', 'Julian', 'Fellowes', 'imaginations', 'Bob', 'Balaban', 'late', 'director', 'Robert', 'Altman', 'viewers', 'find', 'transported', 'upper', 'crust', 'society', '1932', 'England', 'where', 'devious', 'Sir', 'William', 'McCordle', 'Michael', 'Gambon', 'elegant', 'aristocratic', 'cold', 'wife', 'Lady', 'Sylvia', 'Kristen', 'Scott', 'Thomas', 'host', 'variegated', 'guests', 'country', 'estate', 'weekend', 'shooting', 'party.Young', 'Mary', 'Maceachran', 'Kelly', 'Macdonald', 'employer', 'Constance', 'Countess', 'Trenham', 'Dame', 'Maggie', 'Smith', 'niece', 'estate', 'encountering', 'actor/singer/composer', 'Ivor', 'Novello', 'Sir', 'William', 'second', 'cousin', 'amiable', 'very', 'gifted', 'Jeremy', 'Northam', 'road', 'friend', 'producer', 'Morris', 'Weissman', 'crude', 'Bob', 'Balaban', 'route', 'same', 'destination.Others', 'arriving', 'estate', 'rainy', 'November', 'day', 'include', 'hostess', 'sisters', 'Louisa', 'Lavinia', 'Geraldine', 'Sommerville', 'Natasha', 'Wightman', 'Lord', 'Stockbridge', 'Commander', 'Meredith', 'Charles', 'Dance', 'Tom', 'Hollander', 'McCordle', 'daughter', 'Isobel', 'Camilla', 'Rutherford', 'suitor', 'Lord', 'Rupert', 'Standish', 'Lawrence', 'Fox', 'who', 'accompanied', 'friend', 'Mr.', 'Jeremy', 'Blond', 'Trent', 'Ford', 'Nesbitts', 'Freddie', 'Mabel', 'James', 'Wilby', 'Claudey', 'Blakely', 'are', 'couple', 'who', 'be', 'broke', 'relationship', 'tense', 'volatile.The', 'butler', 'Jennings', 'Alan', 'Bates', 'guests', 'entrance', 'servants', 'arrival', 'Indoors', 'downstairs', 'set', 'are', 'directed', 'Mrs.', 'Wilson', 'Helen', 'Mirren', 'chief', 'housekeeper', 'other', 'notable', 'servants', 'drama', 'include', 'Mrs.', 'Croft', 'Eileen', 'Atkins', 'Probst', 'valet', 'Derek', 'Jacobi', 'Robert', 'Parks', 'subtly', 'charismatic', 'Clive', 'Owen', 'gauche', 'mysterious', 'Henry', 'Denton', 'Ryan', 'Phillippe', 'who', 'seduce', 'Mary', 'one', 'point', 'head', 'housemaid', 'Elsie', 'hard-bitten', 'Emily', 'Watson', 'who', 'more', 'one', 'employer', 'quite', 'intimately.During', 'afternoon', 'tea', 'Novello', 'receiving', 'end', 'Constance', 'caustic', 'views', 'career', 'also', 'receiving', 'end', 'Mabel', 'admiration.In', 'style', 'tradition', 'episodes', 'Mystery', 'Masterpiece', 'Theater', 'are', 'led', 'upper', 'crust', 'rituals', 'formal', 'dinners', 'games', 'pool', 'shooting', 'party', 'itself.After', 'one', 'many', 'scandalous', 'secrets', 'revealed', 'Novello', 'called', 'ease', 'tension', 'playing', 'few', 'numbers', 'Can', 'Give', 'Starlight', 'was', 'composed', 'seven', 'years', 'story', 'place', 'inaccuracy', 'found', 'glad', 'was', 'included', 'piano', 'stylings', 'Jeremy', 'Northam', 'and/or', 'brother', 'Christopher', 'liven', 'things', 'up', 'more', 'little', 'well-enunciated', 'Broadway-ish', 'singing', 'voice', 'former', 'allegedly', 'developed', 'real-life', 'stint', 'singing', 'waiter', 'pleasant', 'one', 'Watching', 'servants', 'dance', 'distant', 'sound', 'tunes', 'priceless', 'emphasizing', 'spontaneous', 'joy', 'downstairs', 'set.When', 'host', 'found', 'dead', 'study', 'ever-present', 'dog', 'close', 'hand', 'reaction', 'present', 'one', 'temporary', 'stunned', 'surprise', 'horror', 'even', 'widow.Stephen', 'Fry', 'Inspector', 'Thompson', 'called', 'assistant', 'Constable', 'Dexter', 'Ron', 'Webster', '.While', 'tears', 'are', 'shed', 'generally', 'crisis', 'met', 'stereotypical', 'British', 'reserve', 'widow', 'daughter', 'entertain', 'guests', 'clad', 'mourning', 'more', 'unflattering', 'secrets', 'departed', 'are', 'revealed', 'pretentiousness', 'upstairs', 'set', 'Constable', 'Dexter', 'summary', 'world', 'one', 'dead-on', 'precision', 'poisonous', 'paradise', 'Soon', 'many', 'involved', 'find', 'making', 'life-altering', 'choices', 'unable', 'do', 'so', 'are', 'left', 'new', 'dilemmas', 'and/or', 'grief', 'not', 'just', 'deceased', 'also', 'several', 'instances', 'issues', 'pertaining', 'treatement', 'them.The', 'reprise', 'Novello', 'Land', 'Might-Have-Been', 'fitting', 'conclusion', 'piece', 'sweet', 'sour', 'slice', 'upper-crust', 'life', 'by-gone', 'era', 'fine', 'viewing', 'quiet', 'evenings']",N/A
590016,A1F2UP7X9KB2YF,B00005JKNF,Demosthenes,"[9, 12]","This is an average film that should have been a good film.  It is unsatisfying.Upon reflection, notwithstanding the Academy Award to Julian Fellows, the problem lies with the script.  It has the wrong feel.  Robert Altman did not understand the culture being depicted, and so it is depicted through a lens that doesn't capture it accurately.  There is dialogue in the script that is just wrong.  There are accents that are wrong.  There is body language that is wrong, that does not fit properly in the class structure of that society.  It isn't badly wrong, but it is consistently wrong throughout the film. It persistently undermines the credibility of the charcters.Notwithstanding reasonable acting, the scripted portrayal of the police inspector and his sidekick is particularly weak. It is utterly ham-fisted - something that fits in an Americn film, perhaps, but not on an English country estate in the early 1930's.  If the Director has decided to make a murder mystery drama, then he needs to make up his mind to do a murder mystery drama.  It cannot include inspector Clouseau and remain a serious film. The weakness of that portrayal undermines both the seriousness of the drama, and the critique of the English class structure.  That is not the only portrayal that is ham-fisted, either.Upper class English society was then (and sometimes even now, is) about reserve, suppression of emotion, subtlety, and irony.  If you were ""in service"" you were ""in service"".  Which member of the household staff in this film behaves as if they were ""in service"" or as if they understand what the term means?  Compare the conduct of the staff in this film with, for example, ""The Remains of the Day"", which captures it far, far better.There is far too much swearing, at the wrong times, for the wrong reasons, in the wrong way, and frequently by the wrong people.We have a Jewish American film producer at an estate in the English countryside, and the problem is that he is peculiar because he is a vegetarian? In that era?  In a society then riven with anti-semitism? Who is kidding whom?His lordship is an industrial sweatshop owner?  Really?  In that era the landed class had a very strong aversion to people who were ""in trade"".  This fellow had multiple illegitimate children with working girls in his sweatshops? Are you doing Dickens, or are you doing Jane Austen?  Make up your mind.Meanwhile his wife cavorts with the staff of strangers at the drop of a hot glass of milk? The scullery maid services every man in the place down in the kitchens, and hasn't been fired long since? Again, who is kidding whom?It's too much.  Way, way, way too much. That concatenation of improbabilities adds up to several shark-jumpings.At the end of the day, it is rooted in a basic problem: The director does not understand the society he is trying to depict on screen, and doesn't get that his portrayal tends to caricature.  It spoils what could have been a much better film.",3,Robert Altman was the wrong guy to do this film.,1330819200,"03 4, 2012",2012,2967,"['average', 'film', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'good', 'film', 'unsatisfying.Upon', 'reflection', 'notwithstanding', 'Academy', 'Award', 'Julian', 'Fellows', 'problem', 'script', 'wrong', 'feel', 'Robert', 'Altman', 'did', 'not', 'understand', 'culture', 'being', 'depicted', 'depicted', 'lens', ""n't"", 'capture', 'accurately', 'dialogue', 'script', 'just', 'wrong', 'are', 'accents', 'are', 'wrong', 'body', 'language', 'wrong', 'not', 'fit', 'properly', 'class', 'structure', 'society', ""n't"", 'badly', 'wrong', 'consistently', 'wrong', 'film', 'persistently', 'credibility', 'charcters.Notwithstanding', 'reasonable', 'acting', 'scripted', 'portrayal', 'police', 'inspector', 'sidekick', 'particularly', 'weak', 'utterly', 'ham-fisted', 'something', 'Americn', 'film', 'perhaps', 'not', 'English', 'country', 'estate', 'early', '1930', 'Director', 'decided', 'make', 'murder', 'mystery', 'drama', 'then', 'make', 'up', 'mind', 'do', 'murder', 'mystery', 'drama', 'can', 'not', 'include', 'inspector', 'Clouseau', 'remain', 'serious', 'film', 'weakness', 'portrayal', 'seriousness', 'drama', 'critique', 'English', 'class', 'structure', 'not', 'only', 'portrayal', 'ham-fisted', 'either.Upper', 'class', 'English', 'society', 'was', 'then', 'sometimes', 'even', 'now', 'reserve', 'suppression', 'emotion', 'subtlety', 'irony', 'were', 'service', 'were', 'service', 'Which', 'member', 'household', 'staff', 'film', 'were', 'service', 'understand', 'what', 'term', 'Compare', 'conduct', 'staff', 'film', 'example', 'Remains', 'Day', 'far', 'far', 'far', 'too', 'much', 'swearing', 'wrong', 'times', 'wrong', 'reasons', 'wrong', 'way', 'frequently', 'wrong', 'people.We', 'have', 'Jewish', 'American', 'film', 'producer', 'estate', 'English', 'countryside', 'problem', 'peculiar', 'vegetarian', 'era', 'society', 'then', 'riven', 'anti-semitism', 'Who', 'kidding', 'whom', 'lordship', 'industrial', 'sweatshop', 'owner', 'Really', 'era', 'landed', 'class', 'had', 'very', 'strong', 'aversion', 'people', 'who', 'were', 'trade', 'fellow', 'had', 'multiple', 'illegitimate', 'children', 'working', 'girls', 'sweatshops', 'Are', 'doing', 'Dickens', 'are', 'doing', 'Jane', 'Austen', 'Make', 'up', 'wife', 'cavorts', 'staff', 'strangers', 'drop', 'hot', 'glass', 'milk', 'scullery', 'maid', 'services', 'man', 'place', 'down', 'kitchens', ""n't"", 'been', 'fired', 'long', 'Again', 'who', 'kidding', 'whom', 'too', 'much', 'Way', 'way', 'way', 'too', 'much', 'concatenation', 'improbabilities', 'up', 'several', 'shark-jumpings.At', 'end', 'day', 'rooted', 'basic', 'problem', 'director', 'not', 'understand', 'society', 'trying', 'depict', 'screen', ""n't"", 'get', 'portrayal', 'caricature', 'what', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'much', 'better', 'film']",N/A

The suspects run from the upper class strata in his estate including Kristin Scott Thomas as his wife, Jeremy Northam as a silver-screen idol, Maggie Smith as a snobbish countess and a dozen more - along with a huge cluster of maids, footmen and cooks played by the talents of Emily Watson, Kelly MacDonald, Ryan Phillippe et al under the supervision of housekeeper Helen Mirren and majordomo Alan Bates.For fans who crave an intelligent whodunit judging that Gosford Park is Jean Renoir's classic Rules of the Game written by sleuth writers Agatha Christie and Evelyn Waugh will be disappointed. It is precisely a smokescreen to dramatize and mock the British hierachy when the Empire was crumbling in 1932 under financial doldrums and servants pressing for freedom.It is with Altman's mastery in his sweeping visuals that roam and spy amongst the upstairs-downstairs that makes Gosford Park dazzling in its scope of parodying - where you watch the snobs ostracize and the servants fornicate and gossip with deceit - and clinches him a Golden Globe Award for best director. He prudently trains his eye on the talented ensemble that comprises of British screen goddess and Hollywood stars who together, delivers top-notch performances particularly the restraint of Helen Mirren and the dry sardonic Maggie Smith.

These are people you meet at large dinner parties (minus the accents).Maggie Smith and Helen Mirren were nominated for best-supporting Oscars and I had thought, as much as I love these performers, I wonder if they're just nominations for their body of work.

Costume dramas are almost always boringly similar.  People wear fancy clothes, sip tea, become attracted to people they shouldn't become attracted to, and say things like, ""I love Lord Fibberbush, but he's not of my class!  Oh, the pain!"".  If you're a historian, it's usually fun.  If you're a normal person, it's usually agony.So it's pleasing to report that Robert Altman's Gosford Park is a refreshingly entertaining period piece, filled with snappy dialogue (when you can follow it), murder, sex, and an attractive, if not downright exhaustive, cast.  It's also refreshing to see that the notion of servants having more integrity than the people they serve has been debunked here.  Here, both upstairs and downstairs feature characters who lie, gossip, and backstab.  Altman's direction, as always, make you feel like a voyeur, like you're watching something you're not supposed to.  And that's the fun - you're peeking in on one nasty cocktail party, which is always amusing.But, this being Altman, it's an acquired taste.  His overlapping dialogue and low sound mix combine with a broad range of dialects to make viewers strain to hear everything.  You're not supposed to hear everything, of course, but not everyone will know that, and it could be annoying after a while.  The film is also a bit of a puff piece.  It doesn't say anything particularly new about class struggles back in 1930's England, then again it doesn't try.  The reason Gosford Park feels like more than what is actually is is more a tribute to the cast, particularly Helen Mirren, Maggie Smith (who could do her part in her sleep), Michael Gambon, and Clive Owen.  Owen, in particular, has ""movie star"" written all over him.  He has a presence that trumps everyone else on screen, and it should serve him well if, as rumored, he becomes the next James Bond.Overall, Gosford Park is a nice, airy entertainment brought to a higher level by the skill of its stars and its director.  It makes for a nice evening diversion.

Nominally a closed house English murder mystery taking place during a 1930's weekend shooting party at a country estate, it features a huge cast of developed characters, a variety of colliding subplots, and highly detailed period sets.  Shot in typical Altman style, the camera ranges upstairs among the aristocrats and downstairs among the servants.  There is so much going on that the actual murder almost gets lost in the near chaos.Each of the guests gathering at Sir William McCorkle's (Michael Gambon) estate for the weekend shooting party has an agenda.  Many are financially dependent to one degree or another on the coarse and selfish McCorkle. Rivalries are fought out in politely understated but often vicious conversations.  Much of the story is told through the eyes of the servants below stairs, headed by Alan Bates as the head butler and Helen Mirren in a magnificent turn as the housekeeper.  Each of the servants has his or her stoutly defended place in the hierarchy of the house, and his or her own secrets, which are suspensefully doled out over the course of the film.  Clive Owen, a valet with an attitude, will turn out to have both a leading role and surprising connections with several members of the household.  Kelly McDonald, as a young lady's maid learning her trade serving a waspish but financially needy Countess played by Maggie Smith, provides an innocent viewpoint on much of the goings-on.The murder itself is something of an afterthought, ineptly investigated by a pompous police inspector (in a typically humorous performance by Stephen Fry).  Its solution will play out among members of the household in unexpected ways that have little to do with law enforcement.This is a challenging film to watch.  Viewers will want to take advantage of the extra features on this DVD for more insight into what is going and how ""Gosford Park"" was put together.

Many viewers will want to see this movie just for a well-dressed, deceitful, and possibly gay character played by Ryan Phillipe, and who can blame them? Phillipe is a handsome and clever actor. But Maggie Smith  really makes the movie, with her quiet little insults and her gentle scene-stealing.The movie is as much about the servants in Gosford Park as about the well-to-do characters who pretend to deserve our attention more. Director Robert Altman brilliantly plays the two sets of characters off each other, toying with their similarities without ignoring the class differences and injustices that keep them apart. Those similarities first become obvious when one of the new arrivals learns that she will be known not by her own name but by the name of the woman she serves.I wouldn't call this a great comedy, or a great mystery, though it strives to be both.

The insights into the servants and the upper-class relationships is startling for fans of ""Masterpiece Theatre,"" but the storyline is bogged down by the tepid murder mystery, and the film putters to an unsatisfying end.At an old British country house in the 1930s, guests are arriving through the rain for a shooting party. Sir William McCordle (Michael Gambon) is an unscrupulous noveau riche aristocrat, and he presides over a household that contains many servants: butler, housekeeper, footmen, maids, and many more. Like good early-20th-century servants, they know their place in the strict hierarchy.But things come unravelled as the guests arrive: acid tongued Countess of Trentham (Maggie Smith) and her naive maid Mary (Kelly MacDonald), and her sisters and brothers-in-law. Adding a bit of American flavor is actor Ivor Novello (Jeremy Northam) and producer Morris Weissman (Bob Balaban). But then McCordle is poisoned and stabbed, and a thick, sticky web of old lies, seduction and malice is uncovered.If nothing else, ""Gosford Park"" is soothing to watch. We get a great view of the trappings of the 1930s British upper-crust. Altman also lingers on little things like putting on jewelry, driving an old car or setting a table, which gives a pleasant feel to the slow-paced plot. The murder scene is one of the few shocking, fast-paced parts of the whole movie.As a mystery, it's a dismal failure -- it meanders along, providing lots of red herrings, and the surprise finale is an abrupt, epic anticlimax. The biggest mystery is who Ryan Phillipe is. As a period piece and class commentary, it's surprisingly effective -- we not only get to see the ""downstairs"" people, but we get a glimpse of how they were used and ignored by the people they worked for, and how snobbery can seep into any social class.Altman also injects a little subtle comedy, such as the inept detective (wonderfully played by Stephen Fry) who ignores everyone of the lower classes. Despite this, you're left to judge the characters by themselves. And he manages to keep things interesting in otherwise boring scenes, by using some elaborate camerawork, slowly rotating as the characters talk about class and position.Maggie Smith is the scene-stealer here, as a barb-tongued old lady who doesn't hold back on anybody. Ryan Phillipe is completely stone-faced, but he seems to be doing so deliberately. Michael Gambon blusters his way through a dull role, but Helen Mirren is outstanding as the housekeeper, and Kelly Macdonald gives off an air of corrupted innocence as Mary.""Gosford Park"" is marred by a dreadful mystery story, but the class commentary and sets are deeply striking.

590031,A34GZPHWYPSY2T,B00005JKNF,"E. Hernandez ""Call me Harry""","[1, 1]","GOSFORD PARK (2001, 137 minutes) is a confection written by aristocratic British writer-actor Julian Fellowes, but actually conceived by the late Robert Altman with Bob Balaban, and directed by Robert Altman (who deservedly won an Oscar for his do-what-you-do-best-and-I'll-just-film-it style).Funny, I had never seen this before today, and only knew it really as a Ryan Phillippe film. I LOVE Ryan Phillippe.Originally wanting to do an Agatha Christie story that had never been filmed and unable to find one (I know of several but they never hit on those), Altman and Balaban lunched together several times and conceived of this general theme. It concentrates on a murder, but as Altman put it, he wanted not so much a ""whodunit"" as an ""well, it was done"" type of film. Set in an English country estate in 1932, Altman wanted this story to be told from the servants' viewpoints.Enter Fellowes with a pitch-perfect story and script: an obnoxious brute of an English lord (Sir Michael Gambon) is murdered at a dinner party while entertaining Ivor Novello (Jeremy Northam) among many others. The cast is a stellar Who's Whom of English screen, with the likes of Derek Jacobi in a sort of bit part as a servant, while Ryan Philippe (the only American here besides Balaban) plays an actor friend of Novello's who poses as a servant at first, but then ends upstairs.When you have a film that pits deliciously executed scenes with Helen Mirren downstairs and (as per usual it seems) Maggie Smith upstairs, let us say only Altman could have talked them into it. In a complete 180 from your typical film, every character has meaning, significance and presence. No cardboard cutouts would ever pollute an Altman film. In fact its weaknesses - which include meandering cameras and great lines practically lost on the viewer - are also its greatness.One character pathetically lost on the audience as well as in the film itself is the bumbling, incompetent Inspector Thom-Thom-Thompson as I like to call him, played by Stephen Fry. The brilliance there is every time he tries introducing himself, he gets as far as ""Inspector Thom..."" and is loudly interrupted. It was great in its execution, and at least Altman let us finally learn his name. Though he has some sharp little scenes, I felt that more should have been done with him.This is truly a completely forgotten marvel, an honest, beautifully filmed gem that I think few people have seen. The actors and Altman himself refer to it as ""a small film"". Pity it has actually turned into a small film, but I rather suspect that like all its companions from 2000 and 2001, it was forgotten in the horrific wake of 9-11.Odd that it proved a refreshing tonic for me in the wake of another horror, the school shootings in Connecticut. This is the first and only time I've seen it, but plan to watch it again just to enjoy the pure artistry. I have a feeling that was always Altman's intention with any project - or as he liked to call them, ""experiments"".Altman, who died in 2006, is known to me almost exclusively via his major films M*A*S*H*, POPEYE (his first two big hits which I rather hated at first but have grown on me), VINCENT & THEO (see my review), PRET-A-PORTER (see my review), and COOKIE'S FORTUNE.In any case, whether you love British film (which this is, undoubtedly), Julian Fellowes' writing (which only annoys today but in this case is fresh and sparkling) - no matter what, you must own and see this jewel of a film. It may have its warts and accidents, but only Altman could take and use such things with such genius.

Emily Watson, Helen Mirren, Alan Bates, and Ryan Phillippe are among the well knowns of the servants of the aristocrats.  The strongest performances are by Smith and Mirren, who were both nominated for Best Supporting Actress at the Oscars. Maggie Smith was far more deservant of the Oscar than the winner, Jennifer Connolly.  Smith was great as the sarcastic, tactless, snob who has nothing good to say about anyone at all.The story:  Lady Sylvia McCordle(Scott Thomas) and her husband, William are hosting a shooting party. The party consists of everyone sitting around talking and eating and drinking the night before the actual shooting of birds commences.  They invite family and friends of society.  Everyone brings their own servant.  It reminded a little of ""Murder by Death"", but it was really that funny at all.  It had it's little momments, but this is mostly a dramatic film with a plot twist of murder added to the Altman mix.  It shows the different world and goings on of both the ""aristrocrats"" and their ""servants"".The acting was very well done by the entire cast. I can see that Robert Altman is trying something new here to some extent, and he did a good job. This is a decent film, but It is not one of my faves of 2001.

In a fashion similar to ""Titanic,"" the creators of this film wanted to ""get it right,"" and conducted extensive research on the etiquette of the period.  Ancient butlers, maids, and footmen were enlisted to share their memories, coach the actors, and ensure that the film reflected the reality of the era. Period wallpaper was recreated.  Authentic locations were employed.The special features included on the DVD are stellar; there are two separate commentaries, one by Robert Altman and one by Julian Fellows, the screenwriter-  both worth listening to. The dialogue is a bit hard to catch at times.  One solution: turn on the English subtitles.  This can help the American ear that is not tuned to British inflection.This is a film you can watch again and again, and you will catch new subtleties each time.  The ensemble cast shines.  The connections between those who serve and those served are intricate on many levels (physical, sensual, spiritual...).  A few stand-outs: Maggie Smith, at her Bette-Davis-acerbic finest; Jeremy Northam, who plays the fading (real) film star Ivor Novello, and does a wonderful job singing period songs; the delightful Emily Watson; Helen Mirrin, in an understated, subtle performance as the housekeeper; Alan Bates as the alcoholic butler; Clive Owen as a valet with a secret.If you get a warm spot in your heart when you think of Brideshead Revisited, Howards End, and other period pieces, this is a film for you.  If you love superb acting at its finest, and the art of filmmaking, buy this DVD.  You will find a superior film plus a world of bonus material.

590039,A3CWH6VKCTJAD,B00005JKNF,"""flickjunkie""","[7, 10]","Depending on whom you ask, legendary director Robert Altman is either a fool or a genius.  His fifty year career includes prominence in the early days of TV with his direction of dozens of hit series such as ""Alfred Hitchcock Presents"", ""Maverick"", and ""Bonanza"".  His filmmaking credits include ""M.A.S.H."" and ""The Player"", both critically acclaimed.  His mercurial style of filmmaking is probably a rebellion from the highly structured approach imposed upon him by early TV.The direction of his recent films can only be described as chaotic, with a cacophony of actors speaking over one another, and moving hither and yon as the camera sweeps from one side of the room to the other attempting to home in on the dialogue of particular characters.  Altman himself admits that he doesn't even read the script and really isn't concerned with what the actors say, as long as things sound right to him when they come out of their mouths.  He encourages ad-libbing and the more disordered the scene, the better he generally likes it.  Often, this produces utter disasters, like ""Dr. T and the Women"" and ""Gun"".  Sometimes it produces a gem like ""Gosford Park"".As a murder mystery, Gosford Park is not all that special.  It is fairly predictable with obvious hints dropped at every turn as to who did it and why.  As is the case in most of Altman's recent films, it is difficult to make out a lot of the dialogue with the din on the soundstage of everyone talking at once.  However, what makes this film unique is the treatment of the human dynamic between the aristocracy and the servants.  While lampooning the wealthy by contrasting their behavior with the simple wisdom of commoners is nothing new, never has it been done with such depth and nuance.  Altman's flowing direction of simultaneous events is probably the only way this could have been accomplished so effectively.The all-star ensemble cast is superlative.  Maggie Smith, Kristin Scott Thomas, and Jeremy Northam all give fabulous performances upstairs, and Kelly Macdonald, Clive Owen, Helen Mirren, Emily Watson and Alan Bates are marvelous downstairs.  For film lovers who enjoy good acting, this film is paradise.Genius or fool?  Who knows, maybe both.  However for Robert Altman, this film is clearly a winner.

590040,A29QA79VLQGHY6,B00005JKNF,Flipper Campbell,"[6, 7]","The master collaborator Robert Altman probably doesn't mind, but Julian Fellowes has done it again. The first-time film screenwriter, who walked away with &quot;Gosford Park's&quot; only Oscar in March, deftly steals the show with his commentary on the DVD version of the film. Fellowes is deeply knowledgeable about the English upper class's old traditions and serves as an entertaining guide into their curious world as it was in the 1930s -- the era depicted in &quot;Gosford.&quot; Hardly pausing for a breath or needing to collect his thoughts, the British writer-actor delivers one of the best DVD commentaries to date.Altman, who appears on a separate commentary track, has his moments as well. The secret to his success? Altman gathers a great cast and then waits for them to make on-camera mistakes, thus hitting &quot;that truth button.&quot; Altman, amiable and alert, speaks in the tones of an expert witness at a malpractice trial. He's nudged along by his son, production designer Stephen Altman, and producer David Levy (both unidentified until the commentary is over). In a 20-minute section of deleted footage, Altman confidently gives the merits of each scene and then dismisses them (even Maggie Smith feels his ax).The DVD comes in widescreen only, helping viewers track the comings and goings of Altman's 40 or so players. The picture looks OK; a bit soft and dark in places. The aspect ratio is about 2.27:1 with the 16x9 monitor enhancement. The Dolby Digital 5.1 sound adds unexpected life to the proceedings, delivering great atmospherics.

590041,A2BDZAU0Y4J6NB,B00005JKNF,F. S. L'hoir,"[2, 2]","If one has a choice and is able to play NTSC format, the 2002 Collector's Edition of ""Gosford Park"" is the one to buy. First, it has subtitles, so one misses not a word of Julian Fellowes' champagne-sparkling dialogue as the actors move in and out of earshot at this Agatha Christie-like weekend house party gone awry. The DVD is also in letterbox format and the transfer is sharp and colourful, so that one can appreciate the luscious costumes, the sumptuous settings, and every detail down to the proper silver fish-fork. Thanks to Robert Altman's subtle direction, the viewer is given the impression that he is a participant, or at least, an eavesdropper, along with the servants, who, like silent characters in a Greek tragedy, are so taken for granted that they might as well be invisible--at least when they are upstairs. It is not until they are downstairs, or up in their cramped sleeping quarters, that they assume their human personae, and we discover that they have as many secrets (and are as rigid in their social conventions) as their ""betters"" upstairs.The characters in the film are well-developed, from the wealthy lord of the manor down to the lowly tweeny. With its ""A-list"" ensemble cast, ""Gosford Park"" also treats us to the best of British acting (actually, the best anywhere!): where else can we find, in one movie, the likes of Michael Gambon, Maggie Smith, Helen Mirren (in what is, surely, one of her most moving performances), Emily Watson, Eileen Atkins, Tom Hollander, Charles Dance, Derek Jacobi, Jeremy Northam, Kelley MacDonald, Alan Bates, etc., etc.? Laurence Fox even has a small part. And Stephen Fry milks his ""Inspector Plod"" role for every ounce of humor.The performance of Claudie Blakley deserves especial notice. In ""Gosford Park"" she plays the gauche outsider who has infused money into her marriage and is consequently dispised by her well-born but empty-pocketed husband. She is the only one of the ""upstairs"" guests who emerges as possessing genuine feelings that are not constricted by the ""rules"" of society.  Like a chameleon, Ms. Blakley inhabits her roles so thoroughly and with such sensitivity that she blends into the background of whatever film in which she appears (whether playing a flighty starlet in ""Cat's Meow"" or a housemaid Martha in ""Cranford""). Even though her name might not be on the tips of our tongues (as Mirren's is), Claudie Blakley's portrayals contribute the excellence that we have come to expect from British drama.Not to be missed is Julian Fellowes' commentary, which surpasses the usual ""making of"" commentary and could well be utilised in a university course on British social history. He not only comments on the film but he also elucidates the complex composition of the aristocratic household in Britain before World War II.And while I realise that this film might not be everybody's cup of tea--lovers of action flicks will hate it, the very complexity of the film makes it a delight to watch again and again.

Kind of like Clue but with a bigger budget and less comedy. Unfortunately, I found myself falling asleep because I had no clue what was going on. I honestly know no more about the movie now than I did before I watched it. If you were to ask me what the movie was about, I would say some people came to a big house, someone was murdered, the people left. And you do not have to worry about me spoiling the ending because I do not know who the killer was. I understood that several characters had motives, but I did not understand why. I am not sure if the murderer was revealed or if he or she was not intended to be revealed.Here were my main difficulties with the movie. First, most of the characters had thick British accents and the sound was not done well at all. There was always too much background noise. Therefore, even if I could hear the dialogue, I could not understand it. Second, there were too many characters and the movie kept jumping from one to another very quickly, so I had no idea who was who and how they were related to the other characters.These difficulties left me watching the end credits rolling with disbelief. The movie just seemed to end, leaving no closure. I can only assume that this is the type of movie that you need to watch at least a couple of times in order to completely understand it.

GOSFORD PARK is a gem of a film and only grows better with repeated viewings.Gosford Park is the estate owned by grumpy William McCordle (Michael Gambon) who has a way of distancing most everyone he encounters, his bored wife Sylvia (Kristen Scott Thomas), his frumpy daughter Isobel (Camilla Rutherford), and served by a staff of servants who include the very in control Mrs. Wilson (Helen Mirren), the butler Jennings (Alan Bates), and the head of the kitchen Mrs. Croft (Eileen Atkins).  A weekend hunting party is underway and as the guests arrive the dichotomy between the wealthy and the serving class is emphasized. Among the odd assortment of guests (each with a pack of secrets and prejudices) are Maggie Smith, Tom Hollander, Charles Dance, Bob Balaban, Jeremy Northam, James Wilby, and their valets and servants Clive Owen, Kelly Macdonald, Ryan Phillippe, etc.  The servants are incorporated into the staff rooms by the strange Emily Watson, Derek Jacobi, Jeremy Swift et al. The arrival evening drops a few hints of problems afoot both among the guests and among the servants.  The hunting party is scarred by a minor accident, but the real problem occurs at the dinner following the hunting party - a time when some of the occult problems become more obvious and culminate in the murder of the vile William McCordle.  The police are called and Inspector Thompson (Stephen Fry) uncovers some strange evidence that leads to not only the events of the murder but also unveils many of the secrets of both guests and servants.  There is a surprise ending that somehow makes all of the characters seem more human than their artificial roles they have assumed.This is a banquet of fine acting and ensemble work and adds such treasures as a series of songs performed by Jeremy Northam with great style as well as unexpected cameos by a large number of lesser-known actors.  It is a fine mystery, Altman style, and is as frothy and refreshing as fine champagne!

His impeccable narrative style, that wonderful movements of camera, the discretely sumptuous stage, the fabulous illumination, the acid handle of the script, the prodigious domain of the British mood, the polish and refined cynicism beneath some lines, and obviously the special care of selection of every one of the characters make of this film an absolute artistic feat.The movie follows the great tradition of Agatha Christie ` novels. Altman takes all the time of the world to show every  one of the personages, their affections and emotive lacks are depicted with unerring clarity. The theatrical mood reveals his deep love for this artistic expression. You can realize how the camera keeps always at a discrete distance from the viewer. All of you know the efficacy to use the staircase as dramatic device and natural frontier between the well defined social classes. This will be precisely the accurate place in which we will tie clues, being able to listen the most hidden thoughts, desires or sudden dates.It is a superb chamber work, an immense Adagio where all of us must participate in this smart game of shadowy complicities, those little details that progressively will be enhancing the whole canvas.Helen Mirren, Maggie Smith, Alan Bates, Derek Jacobi, Emily Watson and Cliff Owen are fabulous in superlative grade.

Obviously a trailer or review which tells it how it is wouldn't sell enough theatre tickets.The slim thriller aspect of the film is secondary to the reasons behind the murder and social climate which could cause it.

I felt I was sitting somewhere between the servants and the elite, other than this I honestly didn't notice the direction (which some would say is a directors job).

Lady Chatterley is in fact a Lord. And everything is different. The Lord has the right to have as many affairs with the female servants as he wants. He has the right to have as many children with these female servants as he wants and then to have the babies abandoned and sent to orphanages. Absolutely disgusting. And what's more he may keep the servants for further use eventually. When we know that we know the murder of the Lord will be accepted by everyone in his own social class as justified, that they will cover it up for the police not to find out the murderer. And what's more they will have been backboneless enough not to murder him themselves and let the servants murder him. Here Robert Altman imagines a thriller that becomes a vicious denunciation of the deepest hypocrisy you can imagine, that of the British aristocracy. There is little to add to this tale, except that all in all only the servants have the human dignity that provides them with some human feelings, including for the son that has managed to survive and is condemned to remain officially unknown. It is also the servants who have the liking and taste for the Hollywood sentimental and sentimentalese songs that are sung for the entertainment of the ladies and gentlemen who treat that music as some charming accompaniment for their simmering hatred of the world and themselves. Of course Altman also manages to put one note against the Americans in the two characters from California, one having a typically non-Anglo-Saxon name, viz. Weissman. They are vicious enough to infiltrate the servant quarters just for the sake of a film on the very same situation, hence to guarantee the realism of the servants' side of the film. But they are also gross enough to reveal the subterfuge before the end and that reveals too how much the servants hate this indiscretion that reveals their side of ,the household to someone from the other side of the household. The gap between the two social classes that live along to one another in this mansion is wider than the distance between the earth and the moon.Dr Jacques COULARDEAU, University Paris Dauphine & University Paris 1 Pantheon Sorbonne",5,Hollywood grossness versus British aristocratic bleakness,1180742400,"06 2, 2007",2007,2272,"['Well', 'played', 'pleasant', 'absolutely', 'sinister', 'D.H', 'Lawrence', 'Lady', 'Chatterley', 'Lover', 'reverse', 'Lady', 'Chatterley', 'fact', 'Lord', 'everything', 'different', 'Lord', 'right', 'have', 'as', 'many', 'affairs', 'female', 'servants', 'right', 'have', 'as', 'many', 'children', 'female', 'servants', 'then', 'have', 'babies', 'abandoned', 'sent', 'orphanages', 'Absolutely', 'disgusting', 'what', 'more', 'may', 'keep', 'servants', 'further', 'use', 'eventually', 'When', 'know', 'know', 'murder', 'Lord', 'will', 'be', 'accepted', 'everyone', 'own', 'social', 'class', 'justified', 'will', 'cover', 'up', 'police', 'not', 'find', 'out', 'murderer', 'what', 'more', 'will', 'have', 'been', 'backboneless', 'enough', 'not', 'murder', 'let', 'servants', 'murder', 'Here', 'Robert', 'Altman', 'thriller', 'vicious', 'denunciation', 'deepest', 'hypocrisy', 'can', 'imagine', 'British', 'aristocracy', 'little', 'add', 'tale', 'only', 'servants', 'have', 'human', 'dignity', 'human', 'feelings', 'including', 'son', 'managed', 'survive', 'condemned', 'remain', 'officially', 'unknown', 'also', 'servants', 'who', 'have', 'liking', 'taste', 'Hollywood', 'sentimental', 'sentimentalese', 'songs', 'are', 'sung', 'entertainment', 'ladies', 'gentlemen', 'who', 'treat', 'music', 'charming', 'accompaniment', 'simmering', 'hatred', 'world', 'course', 'Altman', 'also', 'put', 'one', 'note', 'Americans', 'two', 'characters', 'California', 'one', 'having', 'typically', 'non-Anglo-Saxon', 'name', 'viz', 'Weissman', 'are', 'vicious', 'enough', 'infiltrate', 'servant', 'quarters', 'just', 'sake', 'film', 'very', 'same', 'situation', 'hence', 'guarantee', 'realism', 'servants', 'side', 'film', 'are', 'also', 'gross', 'enough', 'reveal', 'subterfuge', 'end', 'reveals', 'too', 'how', 'much', 'servants', 'hate', 'indiscretion', 'side', 'household', 'someone', 'other', 'side', 'household', 'gap', 'two', 'social', 'classes', 'live', 'along', 'one', 'mansion', 'wider', 'distance', 'earth', 'moon.Dr', 'Jacques', 'COULARDEAU', 'University', 'Paris', 'Dauphine', 'University', 'Paris', '1', 'Pantheon', 'Sorbonne']",N/A

Perskie ""ceruleana""","[2, 3]","Director Robert Altman serves up an atypical drama/whodunit, set on an English country estate, the ""Gosford Park"" of the title, during a weekend of pheasant hunting. The superb ensemble cast gives outstanding performances, and an in-depth glimpse of the British class system. Multiple plots and subplots are woven together seamlessly to provide taut suspense, fascinating character studies, and various suspects and motives for the murder of a man killed twice. We are also given more than a glimpse of lives led both Upstairs and Downstairs, and the snobbery and pecking order which exist on all levels.Set in the early 1930's, Sir William McCordle, (Michael Gambon), and his wife, the much younger, acrimonious Lady Sylvia, (Kristin Scott Thomas), entertain a group of aristocrats, and non-titled social climbers, for a shooting party. The guests arrive with their servants in tow. Lady Sylvia despises her husband for his lack of blue blood, love of money and lecherous ways. She takes her pleasure elsewhere. Intrigue, rivalry, venomous feelings, envy, and sexual escapades abound on all floors of the manse, and gossip is rampant and delicious. Maggie Smith is wonderful as the Countess of Trentham, who peers through her lorgnette and tosses-off barbed comments at one and all - except the man who holds the purse strings. She is dependent on Sir William for her allowance, which he threatens to put a halt to. Ivor Novello, (Jeremy Northam), is a Hollywood movie star and English matinee idol. A distant relation of the McCordles, he was invited on the condition that he entertain the other guests with music and song. He accepts in order to wangle an invitation for his colleague, American movie producer, Morris Weissman, (Bob Balaban). Weissman, who spends most of the movie on the telephone, talking long distance with honchos in Hollywood, is researching the lives of the rich and infamous for an upcoming film, ''Charlie Chan in London.""Below stairs, head housemaid Elsie, (Emily Watson), spontaneously outs herself as Sir William's lover. Helen Mirren gives an exceptional performance as the head housekeeper, Mrs. Wilson, ""the perfect servant. The seemingly naive Mary Macearchran, (Kelly Macdonald), is the Countess' lady's maid. She is much more astute and observant than anyone would give her credit for. Stephen Fry is funny as the police inspector, of the Clouseau school of sleuthing, and provides comic relief.

It has the classic setting, 1930's period, an isolated English manor house filled with guests for a weekend shooting party, and all of the servants both resident and visiting.  Everybody has secrets, the tension is so thick it could be cut with a knife and there is conveniently one missing from the kitchen.  For more than half the film we see motives offered and wait for the murder and yet after it occurs it becomes evident that this is NOT a murder mystery at all!The film has been compared to Upstairs Downstairs and it does involve the lives of those both above and below stairs, but it is much more than that.  The various stories are added layer by layer some, such as the imposter in the servants' hall are obvious while others like the secret abortion are only alluded in a couple of lines.  The various stories are, while interesting, not really the point of the film either.  This is a beautifully drawn portrait of a way of life that is long gone and will probably never return.  Almost everyone has read about or seen depictions of English Country Life in the '20's and '30's. It is a setting that has been used in drama, comedy, romance and of course mystery genres for years but Gosford Park makes it clear that we have only the faintest ideas of what that life was really like.  The genius of this film is that it takes all the information that could have been spread out in a PBS documentary series and used fiction to illustrate the same points in a much more effective and enjoyable way.The cast is huge and filled with actors, both well known and soon to be well known.  No one is given such a large role that it becomes their film and yet each performer manages to turn their scenes into a polished little gem.The extras included in the DVD are wonderful.

590066,A3W1JJGJHRPH4Y,B00005JKNF,Jeffrey A. Thompson,"[9, 11]","As a mystery, the movie stinks. The murder is pedestrian. The clues are obvious. The denoement is anti-climatic. However, the movie is about the characters and is a period piece. The movie introduces dozens of characters: both servants and their masters. Amazingly, Altman gets you interested in most of the characters. The movie goes between the upstairs people and the downstairs people and how their lives are separate on the surface, but are deeply intertwined. It reminds me of ""Rear Window"" a little bit, where the murder is really only a device to introduce the various plot lines.Altman indicates in the director's commentary it was meant to be seen several times. He also introduces profanity to move it into a ""R"" rating. The profanity wasn't obtrusive. I hear more in my work place every day. The goal of the R rating is that he didn't want teenagers seeing it; this movie isn't meant for them. The movie expects the viewer to be observant and to not pick up everything the first time. There is an emotional and a psychological depth to the film.There is beauty in the details of the film. The sets are spectacular. The wardrobe is amazing. Even the lighting is interesting. Everything is researched: how the servants set the table, how the boots are shined, and how the class system among the servant ranks is almost more rigid than their masters'.The movie is fun and makes me smile. The director's commentary in the DVD starts off slow, but slowly delivers interesting details.

590070,A8F2AZWB20X1H,B00005JKNF,JLind555,"[2, 5]","Inside ""Gosford Park"", which is a good movie, is a great movie that never quite gets out. It can be taken as a standard parlor murder mystery or as a study in class warfare, but it comes up a tad short on each count. The movie opens on an appropriately dank and gloomy twilight in the English countryside, at a manor house which is the scene of a weekend party during which milord will turn up most foully murdered. Sound familiar? It's been done before, a dozen and more times; and of course we learn during the subsequent unraveling of the mystery that the old coot richly deserved what he got. There is some delicious interacting between upstairs and downstairs; it's hard to tell who are more snobbish, the upper-class guests or their servants belowstairs (the servants have their own hierarchy which is as rigid, if not more so, than they entire British class system), and at the film's end, we finally find out whodunit. But despite some really marvelous performances by Maggie Smith as the snooty countess (she's priceless lounging in her boudoir with those cucumber slices over her eyes), Helen Mirren as the head servant with a skeleton in her closet, Alan Bates as the butler (no, he didn't do it), and Kristen Scott-Thomas as the rich man's wife, we're somehow left with a feeling that this film is lacking something. The ending seems curiously flat. One comes away from watching the movie with a feeling of ""Is this all?""There is a serious problem with the DVD which bears mentioning. The sound quality is terrible. At first I assumed it was me, since I am hearing-impaired; but even with the volume on my TV jacked to the max, it sounded poor. After checking the sound on a few other DVDs, I realized it wasn't me or my TV; the problem was the sound engineering on this DVD. However, the closed captions are excellent and let me follow the script with no trouble.Overall, ""Gosford Park"" is an enjoyable film. There's just this realization that great sets, great costumes, and great performances don't add up to a great movie.

I won't give anything away (almost anyone who manages to stay awake could figure out the dynamics that serve as the unexciting climax), but you are finally told of the relationship of one of the visiting servants and servants of the house after about two hours of pain.

However, NONE of those words apply. I was COMPLETELY ENGROSSED with this film and was very happy I bought it. The move is not about a murder, catching a killer, or any of the other aspects typical of a murder-mystery. Instead, its a fascinating look at the British social class in the early 30's. That may sound slightly boring, but it was far from it. Gosford is chalk full of humor, sexual tension, witty lines, and a twisting plot. Aside from that, the movie is BEAUTIFULLY shot. Watching it on my widescreen HD TV, I couldn't help but feel pulled into the gorgeous colors captured by the skillful and fluid movements of the camera. Overall, Gosford Park is an excellent film that I would recommend without hesitation.

590079,A2EMP366TTS6E1,B00005JKNF,Judith Miller,"[3, 5]","GOSFORD PARK was a nice surprise. The movie was purchased as a gift for my husband and I and we had no expectations because we didn't know what the film was about. It is a British film, and although we recognized the faces of a lot of the actors, we were glad to have the opportunity to learn their names. The acting was superb!The story takes place in the 1930's at a country estate in England called Gosford Park. Sir William McCordle invites a large group of guests to a weekend hunting party.  The movie begins with Constance  (Maggie Smith) leaving her estate to travel to the event along with her driver and maid.  We're treated to wonderful scenes as the guests arrive with their own assemblage of various servants. The often-snobbish guests are assigned rooms and at the same time their servants are in the kitchen receiving their own room assignments. The interesting part is to see that the pecking order for the Earl's guests is not that different from that among the various servants.The camera scans the room while people are talking and it's difficult to hear most of the comments. I guess the director was giving us the feeling of being in any large place where dozens of people are making small talk. Constance is very snobbish and we get to clearly hear her views about the other guests. When a murder takes place, a bumbling detective is brought in to solve the crime.

We are treated to views of two worlds: The wealthy houseparty guests with their secrets, their world-weariness, and their compromises, contrasted with the herd of servants who tend to their every need, and spend any spare time gossiping about their employers.  There's a sweet scene as one of the guests, a well-known entertainer, plays the piano and sings.  Most of the guests ignore him, but the servants gather near the doors and windows and stand entranced, swept away by the romantic music.Maggie Smith plays an aging relative who needs money, but who smacks her lips over a good breakfast and still enjoys the sensual side of life.

There's also a nice contrast between British reserve and American directness. Yet, Hollywood needed a hook, and that's where the classic ""well-dressed dinner guests gathered around a body, wondering who could have done it"" device comes in. To Altman's credit, he wisely spends as little time as possible on the actual murder and gives the inspectors who show up hardly any screen time. Good thing, since the real treat here comes in keeping track of all the uniformly wonderful performances, bedroom shenanigans, betrayals, alliances and nasty infighting.

The screenwriter has experienced knowing people who really lived like this, so he is very interesting to listen to. The cast is filled with excellent actors, who, I think, took smaller parts because they wanted to work in a Robert Altman film and they are sublime. No one ever puts a foot wrong. Watch facial expressions and ""thrown away"" remarks, that are really vital to the story. I would suggest putting on the ""caption"" feature so you can follow the story while listening to the commentaries, or even to be sure you know what the Scottish Mary Maceachran (Maggie Smith's lady's maid) is saying or any other British speech pattern that may be unfamiliar to your ear. Watch for Meg Wynn Owen, who plays Lady Sylvia's lady's maid- she played Hazel Bellamy in the ""Upstairs, Downstairs"" series back in the 1970's (a matchless series, in my opinion- don't miss it). Sophie Thompson (Emma's sister) is quietly perfect as Dorothy, the still room maid, who worships Jennings, the butler. She played a perfectly silly woman in ""Four Weddings and a Funeral""- she was the second bride, but she really shows her acting chops in this film. Watch for the ""strawberry jam"" scene with Tom Hollander and her speech about the meaning of love, even though your love isn't returned. I couldn't recommend it more. Jeremy Northam plays Ivor Novello (look him up on Google- Jeremy even looks a little like him) in a small part but played beautifully. Altman said he threw in the ""F"" word enough times so it would keep 14 year old boys out of the film when it showed in theaters; I don't think it would have been a problem. 14 year old boys wouldn't have been tempted and they wouldn't have understood it- in fact, I doubt if most men would get the point. They would have been looking at their watches hoping it would end soon. People who like the era and all the layers of detail will love it, I am sure. 5 stars from me, though I am a complete and utter Anglophile. You can't go wrong with an Altman film, in any case. It's also a good ""escape"" movie- takes you away from one's daily problems for a couple of hours- make some microwave popcorn and some iced tea (or a pot of hot tea!) and kick back.

Those who enjoyed it call it &quot;beautiful&quot; and &quot;artistic.&quot; Those who did not enjoy it call it &quot;boring&quot; and &quot;tedious.&quot; And the reviews of those of the latter group, regardless of how well they are written, seem to fall under the sword of the former with 5 out of 19's and 1 out of 13's in the &quot;did this review help you?&quot;This is the most boring movie I have ever seen. And the giveaway, if you will, that those who &quot;loved&quot; it feel the haunting presence that the naysayers 'might be right,'is that there are any number of &quot;loved it&quot; reviews who acknowledge that they had to see it twice.Golly. I don't want to see a movie twice. I don't want to read a book twice. Perhaps I am in a minority but I think that the quid pro quo of my paying money to the investors of the effort by seeing it or reading it is that I ought to be able to 'get it' the first time.In Hollywood (I don't know, I have to imagine) we make excellent, powerful movies that (a) are palatable to the public (art); and (b) make money for the investors. These movies are American movies.At the risk of sounding xenophobic, what we don't do well is make French movies. Or Swedish movies. Or movies about Danish teenagers. And we don't make movies about the British class system very well at all.Everything about the movie is true. Maggie Smith is a delight. The photogrophy is lush. The music is enthralling.Regretably, the other things are true as well. If we had to wait any longer for Michael Gambon to die, the poor bloke would have died of old age. The dialogue, when it can be understood, doesn't carry any meaning. It doesn't make sense. Literally, who cares? This is a murder mystery.

590094,A2NJO6YE954DBH,B00005JKNF,Lawrance M. Bernabo,"[6, 10]","I finally got around to watching Gosford Park on DVD, which was important for two reasons.  First, I could turn on the sub-titles because I was having a hard time following what everybody was saying (a point on which I observe I am not alone).  Second, the only thing I remembered about the movie was that we only see the rich folks when the servants are around.  This latter point was more important because it meant I did not really remember that the film was about and since I was not the one that picked up the DVD at the store, I did not see the cover with the rather subtle clue as to what would be going on eventually in this tale.Aside: I was going to see this film in the theater after it was nominated for the Oscar for Best Picture, but you see I live in a town where after the nominations came out last year TWO OF THE MOVIES LEFT TOWN.  But then, I suppose we should just be grateful they came here at all (""Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"" only came to the local ""art"" theater).Actually I was enjoying watching the film without worrying what it was about.  The cast was weaving their little tapestry, but all those bottles of poison I kept seeing lying around seemed a bit foreboding.  No for me it was a pleasant surprise when it turned into a whodunit rather than a character study.  Yet clearly this is a quirky whodunit, since the investigating inspector does not get to finish a sentence for about a half hour during the proceedings.  He also seems to make a point of not looking at the clues, but that turns out alright because none of the clues are the real clues anyhow.Besides, it is hard not to figure out whodunit, or at least half of it, which should lead to you figuring it all out, but you are never quite sure.  What delighted me about this film was that having figured out not only the ""who"" but what I thought was the ""why,"" I was pleasantly surprised to find another twist that made for a wholly satisfying conclusion in my opinion.The cast, of course, is impeccable, which you can tell by the fact that Derek Jacobi is wasted in a small role; he must have wanted to work with Altman.  Maggie Smith is at the point where she can play parts like this in her sleep and while her Oscar nomination was a given, I would like to point out that Helen Mirren, the other Oscar nominated Supporting Actress from this film, is probably as good as Judi Dench but has not had the show stopping roles of Dame Judi.  Emily Watson and Kelly Macdonald end up being the most sympathetic figures in the bunch, especially since each becomes, in their own way, the center of the storm.Finally, director Robert Altman's strength in this film is that he stays out of the way of what is going on.  After an initial shot where we see Lady Constance's maid waiting by the side of the car in the pouring rain for her Ladyship to get into the car first, I do not think there was another specific shot where it was obvious to me that the director was making me see something.  ""Gosford Park"" is an actors's film and that has usually been the primary constant in Altman's film.This is not a great film (i.e., one I want to watch again and again), but it is a very good film (rare enough in these times).  It may not be your cup of tea, but certainly a film that looks unflinchingly at class distinctions would be well aware that there are two types of people in the world.  This is a hit or miss film that you will either love or it will bore you to death.",5,The story of a busy day in the life of a perfect servant,1028505600,"08 5, 2002",2002,3457,"['finally', 'got', 'watching', 'Gosford', 'Park', 'DVD', 'was', 'important', 'two', 'reasons', 'First', 'could', 'turn', 'sub-titles', 'was', 'having', 'hard', 'time', 'following', 'what', 'everybody', 'was', 'saying', 'point', 'observe', 'am', 'not', 'alone', 'Second', 'only', 'thing', 'remembered', 'movie', 'was', 'only', 'see', 'rich', 'folks', 'when', 'servants', 'are', 'around', 'latter', 'point', 'was', 'more', 'important', 'meant', 'did', 'not', 'really', 'remember', 'film', 'was', 'about', 'was', 'not', 'one', 'picked', 'up', 'DVD', 'store', 'did', 'not', 'see', 'cover', 'rather', 'subtle', 'clue', 'what', 'would', 'be', 'going', 'eventually', 'tale.Aside', 'was', 'going', 'see', 'film', 'theater', 'was', 'nominated', 'Oscar', 'Best', 'Picture', 'see', 'live', 'town', 'where', 'nominations', 'came', 'out', 'last', 'year', 'TWO', 'THE', 'MOVIES', 'LEFT', 'TOWN', 'then', 'suppose', 'should', 'just', 'be', 'grateful', 'came', 'here', 'Crouching', 'Tiger', 'Hidden', 'Dragon', 'only', 'came', 'local', 'art', 'theater', '.Actually', 'was', 'enjoying', 'watching', 'film', 'worrying', 'what', 'was', 'about', 'cast', 'was', 'weaving', 'little', 'tapestry', 'bottles', 'poison', 'kept', 'seeing', 'lying', 'around', 'seemed', 'bit', 'foreboding', 'was', 'pleasant', 'surprise', 'when', 'turned', 'whodunit', 'rather', 'character', 'study', 'clearly', 'quirky', 'whodunit', 'investigating', 'inspector', 'not', 'get', 'finish', 'sentence', 'half', 'hour', 'proceedings', 'also', 'make', 'point', 'not', 'looking', 'clues', 'out', 'alright', 'none', 'clues', 'are', 'real', 'clues', 'anyhow.Besides', 'hard', 'not', 'figure', 'out', 'whodunit', 'least', 'half', 'should', 'lead', 'figuring', 'out', 'are', 'never', 'quite', 'sure', 'What', 'delighted', 'film', 'was', 'having', 'figured', 'out', 'not', 'only', 'who', 'what', 'thought', 'was', 'why', 'was', 'pleasantly', 'surprised', 'find', 'twist', 'made', 'wholly', 'satisfying', 'conclusion', 'opinion.The', 'cast', 'course', 'impeccable', 'can', 'tell', 'fact', 'Derek', 'Jacobi', 'wasted', 'small', 'role', 'must', 'have', 'wanted', 'work', 'Altman', 'Maggie', 'Smith', 'point', 'where', 'can', 'play', 'parts', 'sleep', 'Oscar', 'nomination', 'was', 'given', 'would', 'like', 'point', 'out', 'Helen', 'Mirren', 'other', 'Oscar', 'nominated', 'Supporting', 'Actress', 'film', 'probably', 'as', 'good', 'Judi', 'Dench', 'not', 'had', 'show', 'stopping', 'roles', 'Dame', 'Judi', 'Emily', 'Watson', 'Kelly', 'Macdonald', 'end', 'up', 'being', 'most', 'sympathetic', 'figures', 'bunch', 'especially', 'becomes', 'own', 'way', 'center', 'storm.Finally', 'director', 'Robert', 'Altman', 'strength', 'film', 'way', 'what', 'going', 'initial', 'shot', 'where', 'see', 'Lady', 'Constance', 'maid', 'waiting', 'side', 'car', 'pouring', 'rain', 'Ladyship', 'get', 'car', 'first', 'do', 'not', 'think', 'was', 'specific', 'shot', 'where', 'was', 'obvious', 'director', 'was', 'making', 'see', 'something', 'Gosford', 'Park', 'actors', 'film', 'usually', 'been', 'primary', 'constant', 'Altman', 'film.This', 'not', 'great', 'film', 'i.e.', 'one', 'want', 'watch', 'again', 'again', 'very', 'good', 'film', 'rare', 'enough', 'times', 'may', 'not', 'be', 'cup', 'tea', 'certainly', 'film', 'unflinchingly', 'class', 'distinctions', 'would', 'be', 'well', 'aware', 'are', 'two', 'types', 'people', 'world', 'hit', 'miss', 'film', 'will', 'either', 'love', 'will', 'bore', 'death']",N/A
590095,A1L43KWWR05PCS,B00005JKNF,Lawyeraau,"[1, 1]","Directed by Robert Altman, this film take place in the English country side of the 1930s at the lavish and beautiful estate known as Gosford Park. Sir William McCordle (Michael Gambon) and his wife, Sylvia (Kristin Scott Thomas) host a large, weekend hunting party for a distinguished assemblage of guests, who arrive accompanied by their downstairs entourage.It soon becomes clear that the film revolves around a hodge podge of subplots and intrigues, both upstairs and downstairs, some of which are quite interesting, others seemingly less so. They all become pertinent, however, when one of them is murdered by someone in their midst. The film plays as if it were a more upscale and lavish version of the PBS series ""Mystery"" or as a film based upon an Agatha Christie mystery.The cast is stellar with excellent performances by all. Maggie Smith is outstanding in the role of Constance Trentham, a snobby, self-absorbed, old biddy in need of money, so that she can continue the lifestyle to which she is accustomed. Jeremy Northam is wonderful playing matinee idol, Ivor Novello, and continues to extend his range, as this role requires him to sing, which he does quite credibly, in fact.Helen Mirren and Eileen Atkins are superlative as the housekeeper, Mrs. Wilson, and the cook, Mrs. Croft, who are, apparently, at war with each other. Richard E, Grant, Alan Bates, Derek Jacobi, Emily Watson, and Kelly MacDonald are wonderful as part of the core of downstairs folks through whose eyes the viewer see events unfold.Stephen Fry deserves mention for his brief, though memorable, turn as the laid back Inspector Thompson, whose bumbling investigative efforts seem almost sure to leave the murder unsolved. The audience, however, knows who did it by film's end, even though Inspector Thompson appears not to have a clue.The cinematography is beautiful, as it captures the sumpuousness and richness of the upstairs life in the manor home. It also captures the bleakness and confinement of downstairs life, as well, serving to further underline the great divide that exists between the two. The gulf is further delineated by one of the subplots, which sees the character played by Ryan Phillippe gamely straddle both worlds.The one small problem I found with the film is that, because there are so many characters with their own subplots and intrigues, the film is somewhat confusing at times. Moreover, some of the dialogue is occasionally unintelligible and garbled, due to overlapping dialogue, which was a bit annoying. Watching the DVD with the English subtitles feature on, however, would probably resolve this issue.The DVD offers a number of interesting features, including an enjoyable mini- ducumentary of Altman's efforts to ensure authenticity of period detail. They apparently hired a cook, a butler, and a maid who were in service during the early nineteen thirties as a sort of sounding board as to how things were done. It also features two commentaries, as well as a short on the making of Gosford Park. It is a value packed DVD and well worth the money. Viewers who like period pieces and mysteries will especially enjoy it.",4,AN UPSTAIRS/DOWNSTAIRS WHODUNIT...,1161734400,"10 25, 2006",2006,3143,"['Directed', 'Robert', 'Altman', 'film', 'take', 'place', 'English', 'country', 'side', '1930s', 'lavish', 'beautiful', 'estate', 'known', 'Gosford', 'Park', 'Sir', 'William', 'McCordle', 'Michael', 'Gambon', 'wife', 'Sylvia', 'Kristin', 'Scott', 'Thomas', 'host', 'large', 'weekend', 'hunting', 'party', 'distinguished', 'assemblage', 'guests', 'who', 'arrive', 'accompanied', 'downstairs', 'entourage.It', 'soon', 'clear', 'film', 'around', 'hodge', 'podge', 'subplots', 'intrigues', 'upstairs', 'downstairs', 'are', 'quite', 'interesting', 'others', 'seemingly', 'less', 'so', 'become', 'pertinent', 'however', 'when', 'one', 'murdered', 'someone', 'midst', 'film', 'were', 'more', 'upscale', 'lavish', 'version', 'PBS', 'series', 'Mystery', 'film', 'based', 'Agatha', 'Christie', 'mystery.The', 'cast', 'stellar', 'excellent', 'performances', 'Maggie', 'Smith', 'outstanding', 'role', 'Constance', 'Trentham', 'snobby', 'self-absorbed', 'old', 'biddy', 'need', 'money', 'can', 'continue', 'lifestyle', 'accustomed', 'Jeremy', 'Northam', 'wonderful', 'playing', 'matinee', 'idol', 'Ivor', 'Novello', 'extend', 'range', 'role', 'sing', 'quite', 'credibly', 'fact.Helen', 'Mirren', 'Eileen', 'Atkins', 'are', 'superlative', 'housekeeper', 'Mrs.', 'Wilson', 'cook', 'Mrs.', 'Croft', 'who', 'are', 'apparently', 'war', 'other', 'Richard', 'E', 'Grant', 'Alan', 'Bates', 'Derek', 'Jacobi', 'Emily', 'Watson', 'Kelly', 'MacDonald', 'are', 'wonderful', 'part', 'core', 'downstairs', 'folks', 'eyes', 'viewer', 'see', 'events', 'unfold.Stephen', 'Fry', 'mention', 'brief', 'memorable', 'turn', 'laid', 'back', 'Inspector', 'Thompson', 'bumbling', 'investigative', 'efforts', 'seem', 'almost', 'sure', 'leave', 'murder', 'unsolved', 'audience', 'however', 'knows', 'who', 'did', 'film', 'end', 'even', 'Inspector', 'Thompson', 'not', 'have', 'clue.The', 'cinematography', 'beautiful', 'sumpuousness', 'richness', 'upstairs', 'life', 'manor', 'home', 'also', 'bleakness', 'confinement', 'downstairs', 'life', 'as', 'well', 'serving', 'further', 'underline', 'great', 'divide', 'two', 'gulf', 'further', 'delineated', 'one', 'subplots', 'character', 'played', 'Ryan', 'Phillippe', 'gamely', 'straddle', 'worlds.The', 'one', 'small', 'problem', 'found', 'film', 'are', 'so', 'many', 'characters', 'own', 'subplots', 'intrigues', 'film', 'somewhat', 'confusing', 'times', 'Moreover', 'dialogue', 'occasionally', 'unintelligible', 'garbled', 'due', 'overlapping', 'dialogue', 'was', 'bit', 'annoying', 'Watching', 'DVD', 'English', 'subtitles', 'feature', 'however', 'would', 'probably', 'resolve', 'issue.The', 'DVD', 'number', 'interesting', 'features', 'including', 'enjoyable', 'mini-', 'ducumentary', 'Altman', 'efforts', 'ensure', 'authenticity', 'period', 'detail', 'apparently', 'hired', 'cook', 'butler', 'maid', 'who', 'were', 'service', 'early', 'nineteen', 'thirties', 'sort', 'sounding', 'board', 'how', 'things', 'were', 'done', 'also', 'two', 'commentaries', 'as', 'well', 'short', 'making', 'Gosford', 'Park', 'value', 'packed', 'DVD', 'well', 'money', 'Viewers', 'who', 'like', 'period', 'pieces', 'mysteries', 'will', 'especially', 'enjoy']",N/A

Cindy Wilson is again marvelous with a multi-layered performance.  Helen Mirren's controlled performance is breathtaking.  Even Bob Balaban as the perverse Hollywood director is flits about wonderfully.The DVD version offers a tremendous amount of bonus material.  It shows a lot about how Altman works to see the scenes that were edited out, and there are a great many.  I particularly enjoyed the one where Jennings (Alan Bates), the oh so proper butler, is pouring wine into a bottle, tastes it appreciately, and then knocks over the bottle accidentally and cracks up as the scene is cut.

Guests have assembled for a shooting party and the servants are busy.  It's a perfect setting for a classic murder mystery.  But Robert Altman is the director, and so the limitations of the genre disappear in a multi-layered story with a cast of no less than 35 characters. Each character shines for a brief moment as this very interesting tale moves back and forth between the guests and the servants, making a joke out of upper class snobbery while, at the same time showing how dependent they are on the servant class.Julian Fellowes received an Academy Award for the screenplay, which was based on an idea by Robert Altman and Bob Balaban, who also appears in the film in a comedic role of a Hollywood producer.  It's fun to watch all the characters interact as little by little we learn how they are all connected.  Each one is in a life and death struggle for something.  And each one has some sort of secret.  As the film progresses, I found myself saying ""ah ha"" a lot at each sign of recognition.The cast is terrific:  Maggie Smith as a countess who is dependent on her brother, the lord of the estate, for her income; Kristin Scott Thomas as the wife of the rich man; Helen Mirren as the housekeeper with a deep secret; Emily Watson as a maid; Alan Bates as the head butler.  Accolades could just go on and on.  There's masterful acting here.The DVD is full of interesting behind-the-scenes tidbits as Robert Altman describes the process for getting the best performances from the actors.  There's even a whole section devoted to the film's authenticity as some real-life servants who worked in an English country house in the 1930s were hired to advise the producers on every detail of service at that time, down to the color of the bow tie that the footman wore.This film is destined to be a classic in its own right.

I loved it, but I don't think myself too representative of the typical American moviegoer.First of all, the storyline is slow moving, subtle and moves in many directions at once.  Most American multiplex offerings tend to hit you over the head with heavy-handed action, plot twists, fewer actors, fewer subplots, and more (but less subtle) drama.While I found the acting in ""Gosford Park"" excellent, especially Maggie Smith's portrayal of a snobby old lady who loves to look down on everyone around her, many lines can get lost in a soundtrack teeming with overlapping dialogue and British and other accents.  (I cheated by turning on the subtitles, and it helped me to catch things I probably would have missed.)For me, much of the movie's appeal stemmed from the many ironies depicted and the viewer's familiarity with British and European history in the decades ahead while the characters are stuck in their 1930s worldview, unaware, for instance, of the coming Second World War, the end of British colonialism, and the general decline of Britain's position in the world.  I also liked the way Altman takes a well-worn movie genre, stands it on its head and uses it to make observations about a class of people few of us are truly familiar with but have plenty of preconceptions about, and their behavior and relationships to each other and especially their treatment of servants, all while making a whodunit that would have done Agatha Christie proud.Altman has given us an entertaining and insightful movie.  Unfortunately, it's a movie that not that many American viewers will ever appreciate for the masterpiece of irony and subtlety that it is because not many have heard of it, and few will ever be willing to take the time to watch it.My only quibble is that the end comes perhaps too quickly and quietly -- well, I am an American myself, after all -- and seems almost anticlimactic.

(Sorry about that). But if you like Anthony Trollope novels or liked Masterpiece Theater, you'll probably like this movie. A friend of mine recently had two friends visiting from England. They saw the movie and raved about it, but again, it probably helps to be into this sort of high-society period piece.But I will say that as a period piece it's pretty striking--I felt sorry for the prop guy because of all the old 1930's paraphernalia somebody had to scrounge up. Because of that, it did seem very realistic and faithful to the historical details. If you like old cars, you'll enjoy the mint-condition old Rolls Royces that come and go. I'll bet those are worth some serious money.The look behind the scenes of a British upper-crust family and their friends and visitors is sort of interesting, because the movie gives equal weight to both the servant staff and the more noble-born characters. The characters of all the servants--the butlers, valets, housekeeping staff, and so on--are developed in just as much depth and detail as the aristocratic family members themselves. So at least in one important respect this movie is different from your usual British high society novel or story, and actually most of the servants turn out to be more interesting as characters than the high-society types.To sum up, despite my predilection for faster-pasted and somewhat different movies, I still thought this was an excellent film and worth seeing if like this sort of story.",4,Masterpiece Theater on steroids,1017360000,"03 29, 2002",2002,1615,"['movie', 'sort', 'Masterpiece', 'Theater', 'Alistair', 'Cook', 'steroids', 'enjoyed', 'even', 'not', 'really', 'cup', 'tea', 'Sorry', 'like', 'Anthony', 'Trollope', 'novels', 'liked', 'Masterpiece', 'Theater', ""'ll"", 'probably', 'movie', 'friend', 'mine', 'recently', 'had', 'two', 'friends', 'visiting', 'England', 'saw', 'movie', 'raved', 'again', 'probably', 'be', 'sort', 'high-society', 'period', 'piece.But', 'will', 'say', 'period', 'pretty', 'striking', 'felt', 'sorry', 'prop', 'guy', 'old', '1930', 'paraphernalia', 'somebody', 'had', 'scrounge', 'up', 'did', 'seem', 'very', 'realistic', 'faithful', 'historical', 'details', 'like', 'old', 'cars', ""'ll"", 'enjoy', 'mint-condition', 'old', 'Rolls', 'come', 'go', ""'ll"", 'bet', 'are', 'worth', 'serious', 'money.The', 'look', 'scenes', 'British', 'upper-crust', 'family', 'friends', 'visitors', 'sort', 'interesting', 'movie', 'equal', 'weight', 'servant', 'staff', 'more', 'noble-born', 'characters', 'characters', 'servants', 'butlers', 'valets', 'housekeeping', 'staff', 'so', 'are', 'developed', 'just', 'much', 'depth', 'detail', 'aristocratic', 'family', 'members', 'So', 'least', 'one', 'important', 'respect', 'movie', 'different', 'usual', 'British', 'high', 'society', 'novel', 'story', 'actually', 'most', 'servants', 'turn', 'out', 'be', 'more', 'interesting', 'characters', 'high-society', 'types.To', 'sum', 'up', 'predilection', 'faster-pasted', 'somewhat', 'different', 'movies', 'still', 'thought', 'was', 'excellent', 'film', 'worth', 'seeing', 'sort', 'story']",N/A

The director of ""Nashville"" and the film version of ""M*A*S*H"" has a recognizable style that would serve as an excellent template for ensemble cast films. In Gosford Park he applies that wonderfully witty style to a production that initially looks like one of those wonderful Merchant-Ivory features with gentlemen in tuxedos and ladies in elegant gowns strolling around a British Manor.The cast is chock-a-block full of gifted English performers - some of them recognizable to American viewers:  Maggie Smith, Ryan Phillippe, Helen Mirren, Michael Gambon just before donning the long beard of Albus Dumbledore in the most recent Harry Potter films, Kristin Scott Thomas.  ""Look, there's.... whatsisname"" I thought often.The story establishes a busy ""upstairs/downstairs"" feel as the rich and titled are invited to visit the manor of Bambon's Sir William McCordle for a shooting party. Those rich lords and ladies walk and talk and gossip upstairs while downstairs the equally interesting maids and butlers walk and talk and gossip.About halfway through the film one of the titled is murdered and the rest of the film follows the outline of one of those Agatha Christie whodunits, but the richness and complexity of the characters and their interactions with one another are in a definite Altman style that make you care about these characters and whodunit in a way that is deeper than Dame Agatha's fine stories.  You find that half of the upstairs houseguests have a motive, and you discover the same about the servants downstairs.  The movie pays meticulous attention to the distinction between classes and position and income. Maggie Smith Sir William's Sister, Constance, is by position the Countess of Trentham, but she is completely dependent on her brother's allowance to maintain even the appearance of a lavish lifestyle.  The servants downstairs know that they are not in the class of those upstairs, but they are further divided in that their rank among the fellow servants is reflected by the rank of their employer.  At the servant's dinner table they are seated by the rank of their boss upstairs.  They are even called by the name of their employer.Altman definitely differs from Christie in that you come to form sorts of emotional attachments to some of these characters. By the denouement you have come to care about what has happened, and the weight of whodunit has a depth that is far beyond simply ""who's going to jail"".

Sir William is a mean-spirited and self-centered old man, married to a much younger, emotionally distant wife (Kristin Scott Thomas), with many family members dependent upon his continuing largesse. The hilariously waspish Countess of Trentham (Maggie Smith), who believes she has a lifetime stipend, arrives with young Mary Maceachran (Kelly MacDonald), who is trying valiantly to become a good lady's maid. Ivor Novello (Jeremy Northam), a Hollywood star, and Morris Weissman (Bob Balaban), a producer of Charlie Chan movies, are the only guests without aristocratic backgrounds and inherited privilege. The atmosphere of the house, filled with venomous ""friends"" and relations, soon becomes even more poisonous.The ""below stairs"" lives of the servants are also fully revealed, as they share living quarters, eat meals together, tend to the laundry and cooking, and gossip about their employers. The butler Jennings (Alan Bates) and the head housekeeper (Helen Mirren) run the household and try to guarantee that no real-world cares will intrude upon the lives of their employers. Since ""upstairs"" and ""downstairs"" occasionally meet very privately at night, secrets abound, many of them secrets of long standing. When Sir William is poisoned and stabbed (""Trust Sir William to be murdered twice""), nearly everyone has a motive for wanting him dead.For director Robert Altman, the primary focus of the film is on the characters, their way of life, and their values, with the murder mystery secondary. Set in late November, the end of the year 1932, the action takes place when this secure aristocratic lifestyle is also nearing its end, something that the arrival of the newly rich Hollywood characters, Novello and Weissman, illustrates. Dramatic cinematography (by Andrew Dunn) emphasizes the cold and rainy dreariness of the weekend, and suggests parallels with the coldness of the dying aristocracy.Interior shots reveal the contrasts between the elegant and mannered lives of the ""upstairs"" characters and the hardworking daily lives of the ""downstairs"" characters, who adhere to their own rigid social codes. Every detail rings true, and as the characters' lives and interrelationships are revealed obliquely in brief snippets of seemingly unrelated conversations, a broad picture of the upstairs and downstairs lifestyles gradually emerges. Fully developed, many-leveled, wonderfully acted, often funny, and impeccably directed and filmed, this is a film one can watch again and again with delight.

590115,A152C8GYY25HAH,B00005JKNF,Matthew Horner,"[4, 7]","Robert Altman began his career over fifty years ago in television, directing episodes of early popular shows like ""Route 66"" and Maverick"". Who'd have thought he would go on to direct some of the most interesting movies ever made, or that at the beginning of the 21st Century, he'd still be going strong? Like anyone whose career has spanned more than half a century, he has had his peaks and valleys. Movies like ""M.A.S.H."" and ""Nashville"" made him famous in the early 1970s. For the next two decades his work was so hit and miss that some thought he'd lost his touch, but he came roaring back in the 1990s with pictures like ""The Player"" and Short Cuts"". Now comes ""Gosford Park"", one of his best works ever.The English countryside, 1932. Sir William McCordle [Michael Gambon] and his wife, Lady Sylvia [Kristin Scott Thomas] have invited a dozen guests for the weekend. They arrive with their servants, who disappear downstairs while their employers go up to the lavish suites and drawing rooms of Gosford Park House. While the grand ladies and gentlemen are doing their best to impress and entertain each other, the servants are busy seeing to it that everything runs smoothly. The intrigue and gossip downstairs is at least as complex and interesting as it is upstairs. Class and tradition may separate the two groups, but, as the story moves along, we see that they are actually connected in all sorts of ways. Everything runs smoothly until someone [or perhaps more than one] rudely kills the host.... Twice!After the murder, the plot gets a little murky, but most viewers will be having too much fun to care. Altman movies are rarely about story. They are about the characters. His genius lies in his ability to take a script with many speaking parts and make all of the characters distinct and memorable. Most directors can't handle more than six or seven  characters. ""Gosford Park"" has over thirty.The legendary Maggie Smith is a real scene-stealer as the shrewd, witty and acerbic Constance, Sir William's not-so-devoted sister. Ms. Smith can make you laugh just by twitching her lip or raising an eyebrow. Helen Mirren plays Mrs. Wilson, head housekeeper of Gosford Park. She knows everyone's secrets. Stephen Fry is Inspector Thompson, who is more interested in the trappings of his job than he is in actually finding out who killed Sir William, while Alan Bates is Jennings, the head butler who knows he's at the top of his profession. The list of players goes on and on. Some roles are larger than others are, but none of the actors seems to mind. They say that working with Altman is a joy.""Gosford Park"", by the way, is a comedy. It has a lot to say about class structure and the way people interact with one another. It shows how people often say one thing and mean another or use words as verbal swords. But Altman never preaches. He's one of life's keenest observers. It's a joy to share his observations.",5,One of my Top Ten of 2001,1025308800,"06 29, 2002",2002,2926,"['Robert', 'Altman', 'began', 'career', 'fifty', 'years', 'ago', 'television', 'directing', 'episodes', 'early', 'popular', 'shows', 'Route', '66', 'Maverick', 'Who', ""'d"", 'have', 'thought', 'would', 'go', 'direct', 'most', 'interesting', 'movies', 'ever', 'made', 'beginning', '21st', 'Century', ""'d"", 'still', 'be', 'going', 'strong', 'anyone', 'career', 'spanned', 'more', 'century', 'had', 'peaks', 'valleys', 'Movies', 'M.A.S.H', 'Nashville', 'made', 'famous', 'early', '1970s', 'next', 'two', 'decades', 'work', 'was', 'so', 'hit', 'miss', 'thought', ""'d"", 'lost', 'touch', 'came', 'roaring', 'back', '1990s', 'pictures', 'Player', 'Short', 'Cuts', 'Now', 'Gosford', 'Park', 'one', 'best', 'ever.The', 'English', 'countryside', '1932', 'Sir', 'William', 'McCordle', '[', 'Michael', 'Gambon', ']', 'wife', 'Lady', 'Sylvia', '[', 'Kristin', 'Scott', 'Thomas', ']', 'have', 'invited', 'dozen', 'guests', 'weekend', 'arrive', 'servants', 'who', 'disappear', 'downstairs', 'employers', 'go', 'up', 'lavish', 'suites', 'drawing', 'rooms', 'Gosford', 'Park', 'House', 'grand', 'ladies', 'gentlemen', 'are', 'doing', 'best', 'impress', 'entertain', 'other', 'servants', 'are', 'busy', 'seeing', 'everything', 'smoothly', 'intrigue', 'gossip', 'downstairs', 'least', 'complex', 'interesting', 'upstairs', 'Class', 'tradition', 'may', 'separate', 'two', 'groups', 'story', 'moves', 'along', 'see', 'are', 'actually', 'connected', 'sorts', 'ways', 'Everything', 'smoothly', 'someone', '[', 'perhaps', 'more', 'one', ']', 'rudely', 'host', 'Twice', 'murder', 'plot', 'little', 'murky', 'most', 'viewers', 'will', 'be', 'having', 'too', 'much', 'fun', 'care', 'Altman', 'movies', 'are', 'rarely', 'story', 'are', 'characters', 'genius', 'ability', 'take', 'script', 'many', 'speaking', 'parts', 'make', 'characters', 'distinct', 'memorable', 'Most', 'directors', 'ca', ""n't"", 'handle', 'more', 'six', 'seven', 'characters', 'Gosford', 'Park', 'over', 'thirty.The', 'legendary', 'Maggie', 'Smith', 'real', 'scene-stealer', 'shrewd', 'witty', 'acerbic', 'Constance', 'Sir', 'William', 'not-so-devoted', 'sister', 'Ms.', 'Smith', 'can', 'make', 'laugh', 'just', 'twitching', 'lip', 'raising', 'eyebrow', 'Helen', 'Mirren', 'Mrs.', 'Wilson', 'head', 'housekeeper', 'Gosford', 'Park', 'everyone', 'secrets', 'Stephen', 'Fry', 'Inspector', 'Thompson', 'who', 'more', 'interested', 'trappings', 'job', 'actually', 'finding', 'out', 'who', 'killed', 'Sir', 'William', 'Alan', 'Bates', 'Jennings', 'head', 'butler', 'who', 'top', 'profession', 'list', 'players', 'roles', 'are', 'larger', 'others', 'are', 'none', 'actors', 'mind', 'say', 'working', 'Altman', 'joy', 'Gosford', 'Park', 'way', 'comedy', 'lot', 'say', 'class', 'structure', 'way', 'people', 'interact', 'one', 'how', 'people', 'often', 'say', 'one', 'thing', 'mean', 'use', 'words', 'verbal', 'swords', 'Altman', 'never', 'one', 'life', 'keenest', 'observers', 'joy', 'share', 'observations']",N/A

Its director, Robert Altman, has managed to make an excellent film, full of an english ironic sense of humour that I found (and still find) enchanting.The main plot revolves around a typical murder mistery (the classical Agatha Christie's ""whodunnit""), that it is very good in itself. However, I specially liked the way in which Altman used the background, a typical english country house, to show us the dynamics of a class (the aristocracy), in a certain period of time (the 1930s), in a certain place (english countryside).What can happen when a bunch of aristocrats gather together for a shooting party? Well, according to Altman's formula almost everything... The film certainly doesn't lack action, but I believe that what makes it outstanding is how it show us the rigid division among classes in that time (that division still exist now, but they are clearly less patent). One example of that is the upstairs (guests)/downstairs (servants)division of classes.The main plot is very good, and the various subplots are also greatly entertaining.

The guests arrive at an English country house for some hunting. The man of the house is the benefactor of most of the family and they rely on his money for survival. Allowance is what they live on. Some want to invest, but it's always he who has the last word. This of course leads to some friction.It's also about two different groups living in one house: the nobles and the below-stairs servants, but they have ties in more that just the servants way.The most interesting characters are two Americans. The vegetarian (and gay?) movie producer played by Bob Balaban and his help/actor played by Ryan Phillippe, who starts out as his servant by playing a scottish guy.The patriarch gets killed without us really knowing who did it.

Gosford Park is unlike any other film I've ever seen, and I think that's the very reason I like it.The plot, at first glance, seems to be simple enough (in fact, it's oddly reminiscent of a game of 'Clue'): A man invites several guests from all walks of life, unacquainted with each other, to his English country house for the week-end. Everything seems to go along well enough, until the master of the house turns up murdered.That is where Gosford Park's resemblance to your average whodunit stops. In fact, the murder doesn't occur till nearly 2/3 through the film. First, we get the chance to be intimately acquainted with the characters in the house: the upstairs staff, the downstairs staff, the kitchen staff, and the glittery 'upstairs' house-guests whose lives they make possible.The story is told more in hints than in broad statements, which I find refreshing. The screenplay is by the talented Julian Fellowes (you may recognise him as having been the Prince Regent in the 'Sharpe' films) and flows effortlessly and wittily. My favourite character was undoubtedly Dame Maggie Smith's 'Countess Constance' - she's so much of a narcissist it's hilarious to watch.

I found the whole product rather trifling and dull, myself.  When the murder finally happens (well over an hour into the movie), it's so quick and unexciting, it's meaningless.  Meanwhile the overrated Altman lets his excellent cast wander around the estate, speaking in such thick accents, much of their dialogue is undecipherable.  There are so many characters that one needs a scorecard to keep up with who's with who and how they relate to each other.  Altman did do a fine job in capturing the look and feel of 1937 England, and Patrick Doyle's score is affective.  The cast has some marvelous performances, particularly by Maggie Smith as the gossipy down and out countess; Derek Jacobi as one of the faithful valets; Eileen Atkins and Helen Mirren, as sister servants with dark secrets; Alan Bates as the head master of the valets, and Michael Gambon as the doomed head of the household.  Emily Watson, Kristin Scott Thomas and Clive Owen give marginally good performances, no vitality though.

590122,A1RPTVW5VEOSI,B00005JKNF,Michael J. Edelman,"[1, 1]","A wealthy English industrialist invites a score of friends and relatives to a shoot at his country estate, during the course of which he manages to threaten and infuriate a number of them, by withdrawing support for their business plans, canceling the allowances of relatives and abusing nearly everyone, That night, he's murdered, and the following day a quirky detective shows up in order to sort things out, gather everyone into the same room, and identify the guilty party. The traditional English drawing-room murder mystery.Except when it's done by Robert Altman. Altman brings all his skills and quirks to what would otherwise be yet another overly affected episode of Masterpiece Theater, making it into something very different. You've got the gorgeous Altman photography, for one thing, with long, involved scene that move through house, turn corners, and have dozens of characters entering and exiting. The effect is one of being inside of a stage play, and when it works, it works very well. But you also have Altman's more annoying filmic tics to deal with. The mood of the movie moves from solemn to slapstick and back again, and you're never quite sure what you should be feeling. Everyone is quite tense following the murder, and who should show up to investigate, but a comically bumbling detective inspector played by Stephen Fry, accompanied by a suffering- but deadly serious- sergeant. In the end, we, the viewers, know who did it, and why, courtesy of a confession freely given to a total stranger, but the guests and the police never do find out what happened, at least by the end of the movie, so far as are allowed to see.What saves this film and makes it worth watching is the collection of outstanding performances by leading English actors in a wide range of roles. There's Maggie Smith as the vituperative old aunt, a role she really owns in modern cinema. Michael Gambon doing the old industrialist. Helen Mirren as Head of House. Alan Bates as Jennings, the tortured, alcoholic butler with a secret that eats at him. Jeremy Northam doing a fabulous job singing his way through his role as Ivor Novello. Frank Thornton, late of &#34;Are You Being Served?&#34; as Mr. Burkett. The list goes on and on, with one superb performance after another, the sole exception being Bob Balalban delivering yet another wooden, stereotypical performance.So why three stars? Well, as entertaining as it is at times, it just doesn't really hang together. At the end the viewer has the feeling that they've been flipping back and forth between two different versions of the same movie, one a drama and the other a farce.

590123,A1JMQ88IMH0XJL,B00005JKNF,Mike,"[3, 7]","""Gosford Park"" (2001)I was very excited about this motion picture. Not only had it received 9 BAFTA nominations, 7 Academy Award nominations and 1 Oscar to take home, but if you take a look at its cast (which includes Maggie Smith, Helen Mirren, Michael Gambon, Bob Balaban and many other very famous actors) and director (highly acclaimed Robert Altman) you'll also see why. I liked this movie but I do not think it is Oscar material. It had its share of great points and not-so-great ones, but was still a very credible piece of filmmaking.Altman won a Golden Globe statuette for his directing efforts in Gosford Park and proved to me he still has the magic touch that many directors lose when they get to his age (he is an amazing 77 years old and still going strong). He conducts his gigantic cast magnificently, pulling excellent performances out of each. The film also has great execution and terrific atmosphere, which is mostly thanks to his strong enthusiasm and quality directing.The baffling cast is one of the strongest ensembles of 2001. Most of the attention has gone to actresses Helen Mirren and Maggie Smith, who were very plausible in their difficult roles (not that they are that difficult for these wonderful female actors). However, I thought they were both surprisingly underused. Mirren pops in and out of the camera shots for most of the film but her acting at the end of the film is marvellous. Smith is funny but I wanted to see more of her.I thought that some of the other actors in the film like Kristin Scott Thomas (always brilliant), Ryan Phillipe (who surprised me with a stunning accent and performance - his first real breakthrough to adult films), Emily Watson (terrific yet again) and especially Kelly MacDonald who is the anchor of the film. Credit must also go to Stephen Fry and Michael Gambon who look a lot alike and both give hugely enjoyable performances in minor roles.The setting of this film is one of the best I've seen in a while. What could possibly be better than a grand old house to be the centrepiece of a stylish film reminiscent of an Agatha Christie whodunit story? Very cool. Most of the movie is inside and I think there were about 3 scenes that were held outside of the terrific house. Altman is good with this setting though, he gives us like a grand tour of the house and I eventually got to know where the servants lived and bathed, and where the upper-class guests stayed.I think there were a couple of things that had me a little displeased and slightly disappointed about Gosford Park. There are no particularly memorable sequences or scenes in the film. What annoyed me is that I couldn't look back on the film after leaving the theatre and say ""oh, that part was the best"" or ""that part I will remember for a long time"". It was forgettable and sometimes boring. The baffling mystery kept me guessing (I got the guess right, but no the motive) because the killer in the movie could be anyone. The climax of the movie was sort of really unsuspenseful and disappointing, I was saying to myself ""is that it?!""All in all Gosford Park movie worked. It had a great script to work with that included terrific character development and brilliantly written dialogue. However, I got uninterested too often and I think a couple of scenes could've been chopped off. Some of the stories in the film were just tedious. I don't Gosford Park deserved so much BAFTA or Oscar attention, but it was original and well-done enough and I enjoyed myself.MY GRADE: B",4,Not Oscar worthy in my opinion but still very recommendable.,1020470400,"05 4, 2002",2002,3508,"['Gosford', 'Park', '2001', 'was', 'very', 'excited', 'motion', 'picture', 'Not', 'only', 'had', 'received', '9', 'BAFTA', 'nominations', '7', 'Academy', 'Award', 'nominations', '1', 'Oscar', 'take', 'home', 'take', 'look', 'cast', 'Maggie', 'Smith', 'Helen', 'Mirren', 'Michael', 'Gambon', 'Bob', 'Balaban', 'many', 'other', 'very', 'famous', 'actors', 'director', 'highly', 'acclaimed', 'Robert', 'Altman', ""'ll"", 'also', 'see', 'why', 'liked', 'movie', 'do', 'not', 'think', 'Oscar', 'material', 'had', 'share', 'great', 'points', 'not-so-great', 'ones', 'was', 'still', 'very', 'credible', 'piece', 'filmmaking.Altman', 'won', 'Golden', 'Globe', 'statuette', 'directing', 'efforts', 'Gosford', 'Park', 'proved', 'still', 'magic', 'touch', 'many', 'directors', 'lose', 'when', 'get', 'age', 'amazing', '77', 'years', 'old', 'still', 'going', 'strong', 'gigantic', 'cast', 'magnificently', 'pulling', 'excellent', 'performances', 'film', 'also', 'great', 'execution', 'terrific', 'atmosphere', 'mostly', 'thanks', 'strong', 'enthusiasm', 'quality', 'directing.The', 'baffling', 'cast', 'one', 'strongest', 'ensembles', '2001', 'Most', 'attention', 'gone', 'actresses', 'Helen', 'Mirren', 'Maggie', 'Smith', 'who', 'were', 'very', 'plausible', 'difficult', 'roles', 'not', 'are', 'difficult', 'wonderful', 'female', 'actors', 'However', 'thought', 'were', 'surprisingly', 'underused', 'Mirren', 'camera', 'shots', 'most', 'film', 'acting', 'end', 'film', 'marvellous', 'Smith', 'funny', 'wanted', 'see', 'more', 'her.I', 'thought', 'other', 'actors', 'film', 'Kristin', 'Scott', 'Thomas', 'always', 'brilliant', 'Ryan', 'Phillipe', 'who', 'surprised', 'stunning', 'accent', 'performance', 'first', 'real', 'breakthrough', 'adult', 'films', 'Emily', 'Watson', 'terrific', 'yet', 'again', 'especially', 'Kelly', 'MacDonald', 'who', 'anchor', 'film', 'Credit', 'must', 'also', 'go', 'Stephen', 'Fry', 'Michael', 'Gambon', 'who', 'look', 'lot', 'alike', 'give', 'hugely', 'enjoyable', 'performances', 'minor', 'roles.The', 'setting', 'film', 'one', 'best', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'while', 'What', 'could', 'possibly', 'be', 'better', 'grand', 'old', 'house', 'be', 'centrepiece', 'stylish', 'film', 'reminiscent', 'Agatha', 'Christie', 'whodunit', 'story', 'Very', 'cool', 'Most', 'movie', 'inside', 'think', 'were', '3', 'scenes', 'were', 'held', 'terrific', 'house', 'Altman', 'good', 'setting', 'though', 'grand', 'tour', 'house', 'eventually', 'got', 'know', 'where', 'servants', 'lived', 'bathed', 'where', 'upper-class', 'guests', 'stayed.I', 'think', 'were', 'couple', 'things', 'had', 'little', 'displeased', 'slightly', 'disappointed', 'Gosford', 'Park', 'are', 'particularly', 'memorable', 'sequences', 'scenes', 'film', 'What', 'annoyed', 'could', ""n't"", 'look', 'back', 'film', 'leaving', 'theatre', 'say', 'oh', 'part', 'was', 'best', 'part', 'will', 'remember', 'long', 'time', 'was', 'forgettable', 'sometimes', 'boring', 'baffling', 'mystery', 'kept', 'guessing', 'got', 'guess', 'right', 'motive', 'killer', 'movie', 'could', 'be', 'anyone', 'climax', 'movie', 'was', 'sort', 'really', 'unsuspenseful', 'disappointing', 'was', 'saying', 'myself', 'Gosford', 'Park', 'movie', 'worked', 'had', 'great', 'script', 'work', 'included', 'terrific', 'character', 'development', 'brilliantly', 'written', 'dialogue', 'However', 'got', 'uninterested', 'too', 'often', 'think', 'couple', 'scenes', 'could', ""'ve"", 'been', 'chopped', 'off', 'stories', 'film', 'were', 'just', 'tedious', 'do', ""n't"", 'Gosford', 'Park', 'deserved', 'so', 'much', 'BAFTA', 'Oscar', 'attention', 'was', 'original', 'well-done', 'enough', 'enjoyed', 'myself.MY', 'GRADE', 'B']",N/A
590124,AUSATFDSU2INS,B00005JKNF,"milss ""Yellow hair warrior""","[0, 1]","A weekend in a fabulous mansion of the countryside between blue-blood aristocrats and a murder is the perfect excuse to reunite to one of the most talented groups of British actors in the new film of Robert Altman, Gosford Park.In this acute social satire, the veteran director presents/displays the exaggerated pretentiousness of the English high class and the relations between masters and servants, outlining clearly the values and opposed attitudes of each class.Completely narrated from the point of view of the servants, Gosford Park is an acute observation of the division of classes that characterized England in the thirties.In 1932, Gosford Park is the magnificent house of Sir William McCordle (Michael Gambon) and his wife, the glamorous Lady Sylvia (Kristin Scott Thomas). To a weekend celebration that includes hunting and abundant banquets attend a spoiled countess (Maggie Smith), a movie producer (Bob Balaban), a matinee idol (Jeremy Northam) and the sisters of Lady Sylvia.Under the sumptuous rooms of the rich, the austere floors of the help contain a group so impressive as the one above, which includes Jennings, the main butler (Alan Bats), Sir William's valet (Sir Derek Jacobi) and the other help members who come with their masters, from the suspect Harry Denton (Ryan Phillipe) to the ingenuous Mary (Kelly MacDonald). All the personnel are supervised by Mrs. Wilson (Helen Mirren), the cook (Eileen Atkins) and Elsie (Emily Watson).The story goes on between the financial and sexual goings and comings of the masters and their servants. Plots and subplots are mere instruments so these characters receive their dose of scandal, gadgets, rumors, treason, sexual tension and murder.Altman, specialist in films with long casts, demonstrates that he hasn't lost his spark and playfulness. For each laughter and playful moment, there's a dark and surprise turn. Gosford Park is so jammed of guests and servants, that the disappearance of a knife goes unnoticed, until it appears in the chest of one of the main characters.But to explore the criminal genre is clearly not Altman's intention; rather it is to make fun of it. The clues are so obvious and the clumsy detective (Stephen Fry) is so obtuse that he destroys more evidence than the ones he collects. As to be expected, there's more than one suspect, and no character is 100% innocent. Not the one upstairs and much less those downstairs. Everybody is guilty, because everybody has a secret.",5,Upstairs and downstairs,1116547200,"05 20, 2005",2005,2471,"['weekend', 'fabulous', 'mansion', 'countryside', 'blue-blood', 'aristocrats', 'murder', 'perfect', 'excuse', 'reunite', 'one', 'most', 'talented', 'groups', 'British', 'actors', 'new', 'film', 'Robert', 'Altman', 'Gosford', 'Park.In', 'acute', 'social', 'satire', 'veteran', 'director', 'exaggerated', 'pretentiousness', 'English', 'high', 'class', 'relations', 'masters', 'servants', 'outlining', 'clearly', 'values', 'opposed', 'attitudes', 'class.Completely', 'narrated', 'point', 'view', 'servants', 'Gosford', 'Park', 'acute', 'observation', 'division', 'classes', 'characterized', 'England', 'thirties.In', '1932', 'Gosford', 'Park', 'magnificent', 'house', 'Sir', 'William', 'McCordle', 'Michael', 'Gambon', 'wife', 'glamorous', 'Lady', 'Sylvia', 'Kristin', 'Scott', 'Thomas', 'weekend', 'celebration', 'hunting', 'abundant', 'banquets', 'attend', 'spoiled', 'countess', 'Maggie', 'Smith', 'movie', 'producer', 'Bob', 'Balaban', 'matinee', 'idol', 'Jeremy', 'Northam', 'sisters', 'Lady', 'Sylvia.Under', 'sumptuous', 'rooms', 'rich', 'austere', 'floors', 'help', 'contain', 'group', 'so', 'impressive', 'one', 'above', 'Jennings', 'main', 'butler', 'Alan', 'Bats', 'Sir', 'William', 'valet', 'Sir', 'Derek', 'Jacobi', 'other', 'help', 'members', 'who', 'come', 'masters', 'suspect', 'Harry', 'Denton', 'Ryan', 'Phillipe', 'ingenuous', 'Mary', 'Kelly', 'MacDonald', 'personnel', 'are', 'supervised', 'Mrs.', 'Wilson', 'Helen', 'Mirren', 'cook', 'Eileen', 'Atkins', 'Elsie', 'Emily', 'Watson', '.The', 'story', 'financial', 'sexual', 'goings', 'comings', 'masters', 'servants', 'Plots', 'subplots', 'are', 'mere', 'instruments', 'characters', 'receive', 'dose', 'scandal', 'gadgets', 'rumors', 'treason', 'sexual', 'tension', 'murder.Altman', 'specialist', 'films', 'long', 'casts', ""n't"", 'lost', 'spark', 'playfulness', 'laughter', 'playful', 'moment', 'dark', 'surprise', 'turn', 'Gosford', 'Park', 'so', 'jammed', 'guests', 'servants', 'disappearance', 'knife', 'unnoticed', 'chest', 'one', 'main', 'characters.But', 'explore', 'criminal', 'genre', 'clearly', 'not', 'Altman', 'intention', 'rather', 'make', 'fun', 'clues', 'are', 'so', 'obvious', 'clumsy', 'detective', 'Stephen', 'Fry', 'so', 'obtuse', 'more', 'evidence', 'ones', 'be', 'expected', 'more', 'one', 'suspect', 'character', '100', '%', 'innocent', 'Not', 'one', 'upstairs', 'much', 'less', 'downstairs', 'Everybody', 'guilty', 'everybody', 'secret']",N/A

590128,A2ZVERVFM25MJT,B00005JKNF,"Mr. B. G. Fowler ""ben1283""","[4, 5]","After the intimate joy that was 'Short Cuts', Altman's previous sprawling movie treat, there are some surprises and some things that come as expected from 'Gosford Park'.  With a cast that is simply magnificent, although no doubt many non-British audiences will not know who several of the cast members are as several are mostly famed for theatre.  The basic premise has a group of people gathering at a stately home to observe a shooting party, with a line being clearly drawn between the well-to-do folk and those that serve on them.  However, as various plot threads begin unravelling a murder takes place that sends everything into freefall.Altman is the kind of brave director that doesn't opt for the easy option of setting off all his fireworks in the first round.  Indeed, with such a huge cast (all of whom are impeccable) he manages to extract extraordinary depth and character from every single one so that we can really sympathise with them or detest them.  These aren't the usual cardboard movie characters but real human beings.  Of course, the cast itself is an enormous asset.  Dame Maggie Smith proves why she is such a legend with a glorious performance, although there's really nothing to fault with the cast.  It's an absolute delight to see Emily Watson, such a talented actress who was so spectacular in 'Hilary And Jackie' on top form as well as a hard-done-by servant.Whilst it's all too easy to go over-the-top with describing all there is to admire about this film, it's probably worth remembering that if long period dramas aren't your thing then maybe you're best clear of this.

590129,A1YHKSTVSYEYTU,B00005JKNF,Mr. N. Carnegie,"[5, 5]","Gosford Park is a highly entertaining British upstairs/downstairs whodunnit set in a 1930's stately home, which examines the social relationships and etiquette of the era and is filled with excellent one-liners and an excellent cast.Opening with a cross-section of British high society arriving at a stately mansion for a weekend shooting party along with their servants at Gosford Park, it is not long before the upstairs downstairs politics of master and servant (illicit sexual trysts, dodgy business deals and unspoken heirarchy's are revealed). Eventually of course the bitter politics and sordid double-dealings lead to the murder of the lord of the manor, Sir William McCordle (Michael Gambon) and so the movie transforms from social commentary (with black comedy) to a whodunnit murder mystery. Although, as is eventually revealed, its less of a whodunnit and more of a who cares because it transpires that Sir William was such a loathsome and morally reprehensible character that his  loss is mourned by (next to) nobody. And so with a houseful of suspects, both upstairs and downstairs, the task of solving Sir William's murder is assigned to the hapless Inspector Thompson (Stephen Fry), a dithering idiot who contaminates the crime scene and is bullied by the aristocrats. He ignores all the obvious clues much to the frustration of his uniformed working class assistant, whilst the guests try to conceal their deepest darkest secrets.For Gosford Park, a kind of cross between Remains of The Day and an Agatha Christie novel, Director Robert Altman has assembled the cream of British acting talent and provided them with a sparkling script by screenwriter Julian Fellowes. Full of wit and insight, the script provides wonderful material for all its excellent ensemble cast which includes, above stairs; Michael Gambon is the grumpy lord of the manor and Kristin Scott Thomas (The English Patient) his very elegant but dissafected wife. Charles Dance (White Mischief) plays 'war hero' Lord Stockdale, and Geraldine Somerville (Arthur/Harry Potter) his wife. The excellent Jeremy Northam (The Net/Enigma/Emma) is acclaimed songwriter Ivor Novello, and James Wilby (Howard's End) plays the Honorable Freddie Nesbitt, to name but a few.Downstairs the servants include; Ryan Phillipe (Cruel Intentions/Antitrust), Helen Mirren (2010/The Mosquito Coast), Richard E. Grant (Withnail and I/Bram Stoker's Dracula), Alan Bates (The Sum of All Fears, Women In Love), Derek Jacobi (Gladiator/Dead Again), Emily Watson (Angela's Ashes/Breaking The Waves/Red Dragon), Clive Owen and Kelly MacDonald. Particularly good amongst this cast are (perhaps surprisingly) Clive Owen (Croupier/The Bourne Identity), who is a good bet to be the next 007, and Kelly MacDonald (Trainspotting) as Mary, Lady Trentham's Lady's Maid. However it is Dame Maggie Smith (Harry Potter/The prime of Miss Jean Brodie) that steals the show as the acid tongued Lady Trentham.This is undoubtedly Robert Altman's best movie for some time perhaps since The Player and definitely since Short Cuts. Infinitely superior to Altman's last outing, the ill-judged Dr T and the Women, Gosford Park is a very elegant movie performed by a faultless cast and even if the ending is a little flat and unsatisfactory, Gosford Park is never less than entertaining.Four stars ****",4,"**** UPSTAIRS, DOWNSTAIRS ****",1034812800,"10 17, 2002",2002,3334,"['Gosford', 'Park', 'highly', 'entertaining', 'British', 'upstairs/downstairs', 'whodunnit', 'set', '1930', 'stately', 'home', 'social', 'relationships', 'etiquette', 'era', 'filled', 'excellent', 'one-liners', 'excellent', 'cast.Opening', 'cross-section', 'British', 'high', 'society', 'arriving', 'stately', 'mansion', 'weekend', 'shooting', 'party', 'servants', 'Gosford', 'Park', 'not', 'long', 'upstairs', 'downstairs', 'politics', 'master', 'servant', 'illicit', 'sexual', 'trysts', 'dodgy', 'business', 'deals', 'unspoken', 'heirarchy', 'are', 'revealed', 'Eventually', 'course', 'bitter', 'politics', 'sordid', 'double-dealings', 'lead', 'murder', 'lord', 'manor', 'Sir', 'William', 'McCordle', 'Michael', 'Gambon', 'so', 'movie', 'transforms', 'social', 'commentary', 'black', 'comedy', 'whodunnit', 'murder', 'mystery', 'eventually', 'revealed', 'less', 'whodunnit', 'more', 'who', 'Sir', 'William', 'was', 'such', 'loathsome', 'morally', 'reprehensible', 'character', 'loss', 'mourned', 'next', 'nobody', 'so', 'houseful', 'suspects', 'upstairs', 'downstairs', 'task', 'solving', 'Sir', 'William', 'murder', 'assigned', 'hapless', 'Inspector', 'Thompson', 'Stephen', 'Fry', 'dithering', 'idiot', 'who', 'crime', 'scene', 'bullied', 'aristocrats', 'obvious', 'clues', 'much', 'frustration', 'uniformed', 'working', 'class', 'assistant', 'whilst', 'guests', 'try', 'conceal', 'deepest', 'darkest', 'secrets.For', 'Gosford', 'Park', 'kind', 'cross', 'Remains', 'Day', 'Agatha', 'Christie', 'novel', 'Director', 'Robert', 'Altman', 'assembled', 'cream', 'British', 'acting', 'talent', 'provided', 'sparkling', 'script', 'screenwriter', 'Julian', 'Fellowes', 'Full', 'wit', 'insight', 'script', 'wonderful', 'material', 'excellent', 'ensemble', 'cast', 'stairs', 'Michael', 'Gambon', 'grumpy', 'lord', 'manor', 'Kristin', 'Scott', 'Thomas', 'English', 'Patient', 'very', 'elegant', 'dissafected', 'wife', 'Charles', 'Dance', 'White', 'Mischief', ""'war"", 'hero', 'Lord', 'Stockdale', 'Geraldine', 'Somerville', 'Arthur/Harry', 'Potter', 'wife', 'excellent', 'Jeremy', 'Northam', 'Net/Enigma/Emma', 'acclaimed', 'songwriter', 'Ivor', 'Novello', 'James', 'Wilby', 'Howard', 'End', 'Honorable', 'Freddie', 'Nesbitt', 'name', 'servants', 'include', 'Ryan', 'Phillipe', 'Cruel', 'Intentions/Antitrust', 'Helen', 'Mirren', '2010/The', 'Mosquito', 'Coast', 'Richard', 'E.', 'Grant', 'Withnail', 'I/Bram', 'Stoker', 'Dracula', 'Alan', 'Bates', 'Sum', 'All', 'Fears', 'Women', 'Love', 'Derek', 'Jacobi', 'Gladiator/Dead', 'Again', 'Emily', 'Watson', 'Angela', 'Ashes/Breaking', 'Waves/Red', 'Dragon', 'Clive', 'Owen', 'Kelly', 'MacDonald', 'Particularly', 'good', 'amongst', 'cast', 'are', 'perhaps', 'surprisingly', 'Clive', 'Owen', 'Croupier/The', 'Bourne', 'Identity', 'who', 'good', 'bet', 'be', 'next', '007', 'Kelly', 'MacDonald', 'Trainspotting', 'Mary', 'Lady', 'Trentham', 'Lady', 'Maid', 'However', 'Dame', 'Maggie', 'Smith', 'Harry', 'Potter/The', 'prime', 'Miss', 'Jean', 'Brodie', 'show', 'acid', 'tongued', 'Lady', 'Trentham.This', 'undoubtedly', 'Robert', 'Altman', 'best', 'movie', 'time', 'perhaps', 'Player', 'definitely', 'Short', 'Cuts', 'Infinitely', 'superior', 'Altman', 'last', 'outing', 'ill-judged', 'Dr', 'T', 'Women', 'Gosford', 'Park', 'very', 'elegant', 'movie', 'performed', 'faultless', 'cast', 'even', 'ending', 'little', 'flat', 'unsatisfactory', 'Gosford', 'Park', 'never', 'less', 'entertaining.Four', 'stars', '****']",N/A

In fact the murder and it's resolution seem almost secondary. What is the more interesting aspect of the film is it's depiction of the interraction between the English aristocracy and their servants.It is a comedy of sorts as well. You have the dimwitted pipesmoking, Sherlock-Holmes imitating detective who fails to discover any relevant information on the murder, you have your typical American who is constantly on the phone about urgent business and then you have the pretentious 'sods' themselves; the aristocracy.There are a number of subplots within the film, all of which are skillfully tied in toward the end.

I've enjoyed the big hits(Mash, The Player, Nashville) as well as the little ones (Streamers, McCabe and Mrs. Miller, 3 Women).  When I saw all the praise I was expecting an excellent film, this isn't it.First of all, there's the dreaded patented Altman sound mix that has worked well elsewhere (especially in Mash where it accentuated the sense of chaos), that is a disaster here.  Trying to make out what these folks are saying just gets in the way of enjoying and understanding the film.  The movie is overly long, it takes too long to get to the murder, I didn't care about the guy who died, and I didn't get that longing to figure out who killed him (this kills the who-done-it).  The interwoven character studies that works so well in Nashville and Short-cuts doesn't work here as it simply meant there were more characters I really didn't care about.  Beautifully filmed? yes!  That's the only reason I can even give it 3 stars.  I had heard how this film takes you beneath the surface of intricate relationships between characters (something Altman can do quite well).

In November 1932, a phalanx of moneyed guests arrives for a weekend shooting party at the estate of Sir William McCordle (Michael Gambon) and Lady Sylvia (Kristin Scott Thomas). Mary (Kelly Macdonald), a fresh-faced, nave new maid accompanies the sniping Countess of Trentham (Maggie Smith), and is shown the ropes by the house's worldly head housemaid, Elsie (Emily Watson). While the masters engage in various financial and sexual intrigues upstairs, the world downstairs has its own curiosities--namely, the predatory valet to a Hollywood producer, Henry Denton (Ryan Phillippe), and the mysterious, cagey servant, Robert Parks (Clive Owen). Mary soon discovers that the image of servants living vicariously through their masters is a false one, and that the upstairs-downstairs worlds are often shockingly interwoven. With GOSFORD PARK, Altman delivers a fascinating, blackly comic look at the treacherous yet poignant gamesmanship between the classes. This is fresh and original movie...very subtle funny...with, scandal, mystery, murder this is a must see.Synopsis...from Gosford parks Offical Website:Robert Altman, one of Americas most distinctive filmmakers, journeys to England for the first time to create a unique film mosaic with an outstanding ensemble cast.It is November, 1932. Gosford Park is the magnificent country estate to which Sir William McCordle and his wife, Lady Sylvia, gather relations and friends for a shooting party. They have invited an eclectic group including a countess, a World War I hero, the British matinee idol Ivor Novello and an American film producer who makes Charlie Chan movies. As the guests assemble in the gilded drawing rooms above, their personal maids and valets swell the ranks of the house servants in the teeming kitchens and corridors below-stairs.But all is not as it seems: neither amongst the bejewelled guests lunching and dining at their considerable leisure, nor in the attic bedrooms and stark work stations where the servants labor for the comfort of their employers. Part comedy of manners and part mystery, the film is finally a moving portrait of events that bridge generations, class, sex, tragic personal history  and culminate in a murder.

Rainy England, large mansion, Rolls Royce, Maggie Smith...all very impressive. But alas, there were other scenes in the movie as well!A seemingly good start is hardly enough to make you sit through this long torcher.Why a torcher you ask? Well, there are several reasons.Too many characters- which of the 643 did it?!?!?!? The film is too long and very, very slow. Nothing really happens. Some may protest saying, 'the plot develops- the relationships are revealed', well, then, the whole thing is done in an extremely uninteresting way. If it weren't for the marvellous thing called 'will power', one would easily have used 'Gosford Park' as a good ecuse for a short sleep.The characters, so many of them, are not introduced well. One can hardly familiarise with the names and the corresponding faces. This, too, stems from having too many characters.All this apart, the film did have one good aspect- that of Maggie Smith.

Director Robert Altman has really outdone himself with this classy, classic caper.  Using his usual, highly textured, dialogue style, character and plot threads overlap in intricate ways that command the viewer's strict and close attention to everyone and everything.  Michael Gambon is the murder victim.  Stellar turns from Dame Maggie Smith, Kristin Scott Thomas and Helen Miram, among others, make for a fascinating trip to the country.Alliance has done a fair job mastering the DVD.  Contrast appears a bit low at times and colors are often muted or seemingly dull, sometimes blending together in dark scenes.  Overall, this muted appearance suits the story well.  Fine details occasionally shimmer and there is a bit of edge enhancement that crops up now and then but nothing that terribly distracts.  Overall, this is a great movie that one can never get tired of watching over and over again, particularly because there are so many Altman subtexts working together throughout the plot at any given time.

The murder, which is led up to cleverly, takes far too long to happen. There are many suspects with overlapping plotlines, but when you unravel them all, they lead nowhere. The ending was a complete bust. It's your typical abovestairs/belowstairs British class system drama. It's more about that than the murder; a dismal let-down when one was expecting a more updated Agatha Christie-type mystery, which is just what the trailer portrayed.

As we know from Downton Abbey, the downstairs is the most fun with the most interesting gossip!Someone is murdered, an investigation ensues, and the most inept Inspector, played by Stephen Fry enters the picture. We learn a great deal about the murdered person, not from the inspector, but from the gossip and the words not spoken. Kelly MacDonald, of 'Boardwalk ' fame plays a maid to Countess of Tretham.

""Gosford Park"" is a slow-paced but wryly perceptive examination of British classes in the early 1930s. Think of it as ""Upstairs, Downstairs"" as viewed through a microscope. The huge cast is difficult to identify upon first encounter, just because of the sheer number of worthy characters who share screen time. So effective is the acting that each of the personae seems to have a back history. This may cause momentary confusion, as you wonder why he or she is behaving in such an inexplicable manner. But it also fleshes them out and makes them appear to be real human beings, rather than conduits of stereotypical posturing. The story line is convoluted in the extreme, perfect for such a ""murder mystery."" I put that in quotes because homicide is only an excuse for screenwriter Julian Fellowes, director Robert Altman, and a brilliant contingent of actors to provide some of the most captivating dialogue and characterization that you are likely to see in any film anywhere.

590153,A3S75QQLGAOOAO,B00005JKNF,Rick Darby,"[2, 4]","No matter how many actors, including bankable stars, appear in a Robert Altman movie, it seems to be about Altman. He has an individual, if by now familiar, style of filmmaking that is always calling attention to itself. That style includes very fluid camera movement, quick-cut editing, and a good deal of dialogue that is covered by other dialogue or sounds distant. We are meant to be awed by the spontaneity and naturalism of it all.Apparently many people are impressed by this mannerism and consider it a sign of artistry. On the whole, I find it pretentious and irritating. In one of the supplementary features on the DVD, Altman, his screenwriter and a handful of the actors from Gosford Park are interviewed in front of a studio audience. Altman and the writer rattle on about how every scene is shot by two cameras that are always in motion, so that the actors are never sure whether they are going to be foreground or atmosphere, or what angle they'll be seen from. Does Altman really think he invented the idea of shooting a scene from multiple angles, and choosing one during editing? And why is a camera that's gliding and panning constantly somehow more &quot;truthful&quot; than one that's framing the character or group that the director believes is most essential to telling the story at that moment?It can be said in Altman's favor, though, that he never makes a merely conventional or routine film; they are all a bit eccentric (a compliment in my book) and, despite my reservations about the camera and sound-recording style, usually offer a fresh view of the theme or its environment. Gosford Park is your standard Agatha Christie-style murder mystery set among a dinner-jacketed, evening-gowned crowd in an English manor house in 1932 -- except, in this case, the doings of the upper crust are set against the army of servants below stairs who work their tails off to make everything straight, gleaming and smooth for their social betters.Altman and his screenwriter Julian Fellows do a very creditable and humane job of conveying the personalities and individuality of the servants; they aren't just symbols of The Oppressed. The characters of the gentry, though, while ably portrayed (the acting talent makes sure of that), are almost universally so sour, rude and calculating that it's hard not to feel that there's a touch of old-fashioned, left-wing agit-prop involved. (The one exception is Jeremy Northam, who plays Ivor Novello -- a real singer and film star of the period -- with considerable charm.) I can believe that an assembly of English bluebloods in that era might have carried within themselves much wickedness, but they would have been far too polished to display it as openly and crudely as they do in Gosford Park.Altman recruited a clutch of A-list British stage and film actors, and they don't fail him. Altman's casual attitude toward the basics of craftsmanship (as opposed to displaying his self-assumed creative genius) ensures that you will be lucky to figure out who half the characters are and their relationships with one another by the time of the denouement, but their cultivated swinishness holds the attention anyway. I think actors love playing obnoxious and unlikeable characters; these seem to be enjoying their roles, and you will, too.The English have a term, &quot;curate's egg.&quot; The meaning is, &quot;parts of it are very good.&quot;",3,"Upstairs, downstairs, cold stares",1087862400,"06 22, 2004",2004,3401,"['matter', 'how', 'many', 'actors', 'including', 'bankable', 'stars', 'appear', 'Robert', 'Altman', 'movie', 'be', 'Altman', 'individual', 'now', 'familiar', 'style', 'filmmaking', 'always', 'calling', 'attention', 'style', 'very', 'fluid', 'camera', 'movement', 'quick-cut', 'editing', 'good', 'deal', 'dialogue', 'covered', 'other', 'dialogue', 'distant', 'are', 'meant', 'be', 'awed', 'spontaneity', 'naturalism', 'all.Apparently', 'many', 'people', 'are', 'impressed', 'mannerism', 'consider', 'sign', 'artistry', 'whole', 'find', 'pretentious', 'irritating', 'one', 'supplementary', 'features', 'DVD', 'Altman', 'screenwriter', 'handful', 'actors', 'Gosford', 'Park', 'are', 'interviewed', 'front', 'studio', 'audience', 'Altman', 'writer', 'rattle', 'how', 'scene', 'shot', 'two', 'cameras', 'are', 'always', 'motion', 'actors', 'are', 'never', 'sure', 'are', 'going', 'be', 'foreground', 'atmosphere', 'what', ""'ll"", 'be', 'seen', 'Does', 'Altman', 'really', 'think', 'invented', 'idea', 'shooting', 'scene', 'multiple', 'angles', 'choosing', 'one', 'editing', 'why', 'camera', 'gliding', 'panning', 'constantly', 'somehow', 'more', 'quot', 'truthful', 'quot', 'one', 'framing', 'character', 'group', 'director', 'most', 'essential', 'telling', 'story', 'moment', 'can', 'be', 'said', 'Altman', 'favor', 'though', 'never', 'merely', 'conventional', 'routine', 'film', 'are', 'bit', 'eccentric', 'compliment', 'book', 'reservations', 'camera', 'sound-recording', 'style', 'usually', 'offer', 'fresh', 'view', 'theme', 'environment', 'Gosford', 'Park', 'standard', 'Agatha', 'Christie-style', 'murder', 'mystery', 'set', 'dinner-jacketed', 'evening-gowned', 'crowd', 'English', 'manor', 'house', '1932', 'case', 'doings', 'upper', 'crust', 'are', 'set', 'army', 'servants', 'stairs', 'who', 'work', 'tails', 'make', 'everything', 'straight', 'gleaming', 'smooth', 'social', 'betters.Altman', 'screenwriter', 'Julian', 'Fellows', 'do', 'very', 'creditable', 'humane', 'job', 'conveying', 'personalities', 'individuality', 'servants', 'are', ""n't"", 'just', 'symbols', 'Oppressed', 'characters', 'gentry', 'though', 'ably', 'portrayed', 'acting', 'talent', 'sure', 'are', 'almost', 'universally', 'so', 'sour', 'rude', 'calculating', 'hard', 'not', 'feel', 'touch', 'old-fashioned', 'left-wing', 'agit-prop', 'involved', 'one', 'exception', 'Jeremy', 'Northam', 'who', 'Ivor', 'Novello', 'real', 'singer', 'film', 'star', 'period', 'considerable', 'charm', 'can', 'believe', 'assembly', 'English', 'bluebloods', 'era', 'might', 'have', 'carried', 'much', 'wickedness', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'far', 'too', 'polished', 'display', 'openly', 'crudely', 'do', 'Gosford', 'Park.Altman', 'recruited', 'clutch', 'A-list', 'British', 'stage', 'film', 'actors', 'do', ""n't"", 'fail', 'Altman', 'casual', 'attitude', 'basics', 'craftsmanship', 'opposed', 'displaying', 'self-assumed', 'creative', 'genius', 'will', 'be', 'lucky', 'figure', 'out', 'who', 'characters', 'are', 'relationships', 'one', 'time', 'denouement', 'cultivated', 'swinishness', 'attention', 'anyway', 'think', 'actors', 'love', 'playing', 'obnoxious', 'unlikeable', 'characters', 'seem', 'be', 'enjoying', 'roles', 'will', 'too.The', 'English', 'have', 'term', 'quot', 'curate', 'egg.', 'quot', 'meaning', 'quot', 'parts', 'are', 'very', 'good.', 'quot']",N/A

590155,A2EDZH51XHFA9B,B00005JKNF,"Robert Beveridge ""xterminal""","[9, 15]","Gosford Park (Robert Altman, 2001)I was truly a glutton for punishment this weekend&#151;not only a Joel Schumacher film, but one by Robert Altman, as well. Altman has been trying for thirty-two years to make another film as good as M*A*S*H. He hasn&#146;t succeeded yet, though Gosford Park is the closest he&#146;s come to it. Like M*A*S*H, Altman here assembles an exceptionally high-powered cast, containing too many both rising and established stars to single anyone out, and throws them into a situation; here, a hunting party. Mismarketed as a mystery film, this is actually something of a drawing-room drama.Unfortunately, it seems Altman considered it a mystery film, as well, because the pace and character development necessary to films of the latter sort is utterly absent. The viewer is rushed through plotline after plotline, given almost nothing to go on in each episode and no time at all to get to know the characters. No one is onscreen long enough for us to develop an affinity for any of the plotlines (of which the much ballyhooed murder of the host, played by Michael Gambon [Longitude] is only one, and a minor one at that), and a few characters jump plotlines as readily as some characters jump from bed to bed.There was much to work with here, and in a movie two or three times as long, it might have all been done justice. As it is, the performances by such brilliant actors as Emily Watson, Clive Owen, and Helen Mirren do nothing but hint at what might have been found had any of them had enough screen time to really start developing. (Mirren, as always, should be singled out; what little screen time she has is riveting.)That Gosford Park was nominated for both Best Picture and Best Director in a year when such films as The Others, Donnie Darko, Monsters, Inc., Shrek, Y Tu Mama Tambien, The Man Who Wasn&#146;t There, (oh, you get the idea) were ignored for both awards is ludicrous. **",2,Might have worked if it were twice as long.,1036800000,"11 9, 2002",2002,1920,"['Gosford', 'Park', 'Robert', 'Altman', '2001', 'was', 'truly', 'glutton', 'punishment', 'weekend', '151', 'not', 'only', 'Joel', 'Schumacher', 'film', 'one', 'Robert', 'Altman', 'as', 'well', 'Altman', 'been', 'trying', 'thirty-two', 'years', 'make', 'film', 'as', 'good', 'M*A*S*H.', 'hasn', '146', 't', 'succeeded', 'yet', 'Gosford', 'Park', 'closest', '146', 'come', 'M*A*S*H', 'Altman', 'here', 'exceptionally', 'high-powered', 'cast', 'containing', 'too', 'many', 'rising', 'established', 'stars', 'single', 'anyone', 'situation', 'here', 'hunting', 'party', 'Mismarketed', 'mystery', 'film', 'actually', 'something', 'drawing-room', 'drama.Unfortunately', 'Altman', 'considered', 'mystery', 'film', 'as', 'well', 'pace', 'character', 'development', 'necessary', 'films', 'latter', 'sort', 'utterly', 'absent', 'viewer', 'rushed', 'plotline', 'plotline', 'given', 'almost', 'nothing', 'go', 'episode', 'time', 'get', 'know', 'characters', 'one', 'onscreen', 'long', 'enough', 'develop', 'affinity', 'plotlines', 'much', 'ballyhooed', 'murder', 'host', 'played', 'Michael', 'Gambon', '[', 'Longitude', ']', 'only', 'one', 'minor', 'one', 'few', 'characters', 'jump', 'plotlines', 'as', 'readily', 'characters', 'jump', 'bed', 'bed.There', 'was', 'much', 'work', 'here', 'movie', 'two', 'three', 'times', 'long', 'might', 'have', 'been', 'done', 'justice', 'performances', 'such', 'brilliant', 'actors', 'Emily', 'Watson', 'Clive', 'Owen', 'Helen', 'Mirren', 'do', 'nothing', 'hint', 'what', 'might', 'have', 'been', 'found', 'had', 'had', 'enough', 'screen', 'time', 'really', 'start', 'developing', 'Mirren', 'always', 'should', 'be', 'singled', 'out', 'what', 'little', 'screen', 'time', 'riveting', 'Gosford', 'Park', 'was', 'nominated', 'Best', 'Picture', 'Best', 'Director', 'year', 'when', 'such', 'films', 'Others', 'Donnie', 'Darko', 'Monsters', 'Inc.', 'Shrek', 'Y', 'Tu', 'Mama', 'Tambien', 'Man', 'Who', 'Wasn', '146', 't', 'oh', 'get', 'idea', 'were', 'ignored', 'awards', 'ludicrous', '**']",N/A

I had a dim memory of starting to watch it once when it was on TV but not making it very far.  After sitting through the whole thing, I am convinced that memory was accurate.Any film with a lot of characters is a challenge.  In this film some of the characters resemble each other, a lot of them dress similarly, and many of them have very few lines.  Also the dialogue is heavily accented and hard to understand.  I really hate to sound like the Ugly American, but I did not find this movie to be very accessible.  It was wonderful to see some of my favorite actors onscreen.  However, my brain was scrambling to translate dialogue and keep up with plot developments from start to finish.Now that I have made it through and am metaphorically out of breath, I feel I need to watch it again, to see some other favorites whom I didn't even recognize (Meg Wynn-Owen, Laurence Fox), but it's a daunting prospect. Maybe I'll see if there are English subtitles on the DVD, that might help.This film definitely has a lot to say on the subject of class in 1930s Britain.  I don't personally think it is a brilliant movie or even especially entertaining.

590163,A1RZ3UGH8B9GQN,B00005JKNF,"Sammy Jo ""sammy_jo""","[9, 11]","GOSFORD PARK is ostensibly an English country-house murder mystery, but in fact the murder plot is incidental to the film, which is really an examination of class relations in Britain prior to World War II.  And therein lies both the strength and weakness of GOSFORD PARK.Like most films by Robert Altman, GOSFORD PARK sports a large cast (the film is extremely well-acted) and the camera wanders among overlapping conversations forcing the viewer to piece together what is really happening.  It is hard to follow, and probably only makes sense after multiple viewings.The particular strength of GOSFORD PARK lies in its recreation of life in an aristocratic country manor.  The screen writer, Julian Fellows was writing out of personal experience, and the filmmakers employed individuals who had once worked in such a house as cook, maid, and butler.  From the mechanics of running such a large household, to the intricacies of the dress code, and the elaborate codes of etiquette, GOSFORD PARK offers a stunning glimpse of a style of life that few of us know first-hand.The weakness of the film is that it has no heart.  It is meant to be a commentary on the social distance between the classes, even as they lived in close quarters to one another.  But there is this pesky murder plot line, and while the disinterest of everyone in the film as to who actually ""dunit"" may be a commentary on the social mores of the day, the fact that even the protagonist in the end seems almost indifferent when she ""solves"" the crime lends a certain moral dissonance to the project.  Indeed, at the end one is left wondering whether or not she might someday find herself romantically involved with a person who is entirely unrepentant about having stabbed someone in the heart with a knife.It is impossible to be deeply involved in a film in which there is no moral order at all.  We are simply left watching a large number of people pursuing their interests, with no reason at all to care about what happens to them.",3,"Not so much ""whodunit"" as ""who cares?""",1027296000,"07 22, 2002",2002,2005,"['GOSFORD', 'PARK', 'ostensibly', 'English', 'country-house', 'murder', 'mystery', 'fact', 'murder', 'plot', 'incidental', 'film', 'really', 'examination', 'class', 'relations', 'Britain', 'prior', 'World', 'War', 'II', 'therein', 'strength', 'weakness', 'GOSFORD', 'PARK.Like', 'most', 'films', 'Robert', 'Altman', 'GOSFORD', 'PARK', 'sports', 'large', 'cast', 'film', 'extremely', 'well-acted', 'camera', 'overlapping', 'conversations', 'forcing', 'viewer', 'piece', 'together', 'what', 'really', 'happening', 'hard', 'follow', 'probably', 'only', 'sense', 'multiple', 'viewings.The', 'particular', 'strength', 'GOSFORD', 'PARK', 'recreation', 'life', 'aristocratic', 'country', 'manor', 'screen', 'writer', 'Julian', 'Fellows', 'was', 'writing', 'personal', 'experience', 'filmmakers', 'employed', 'individuals', 'who', 'had', 'once', 'worked', 'such', 'house', 'cook', 'maid', 'butler', 'mechanics', 'running', 'large', 'household', 'intricacies', 'dress', 'code', 'elaborate', 'codes', 'etiquette', 'GOSFORD', 'PARK', 'stunning', 'glimpse', 'style', 'life', 'few', 'know', 'first-hand.The', 'weakness', 'film', 'heart', 'meant', 'be', 'commentary', 'social', 'distance', 'classes', 'even', 'lived', 'close', 'quarters', 'one', 'pesky', 'murder', 'plot', 'line', 'disinterest', 'everyone', 'film', 'who', 'actually', 'dunit', 'may', 'be', 'commentary', 'social', 'mores', 'day', 'fact', 'even', 'protagonist', 'end', 'almost', 'indifferent', 'when', 'solves', 'crime', 'certain', 'moral', 'dissonance', 'project', 'Indeed', 'end', 'one', 'left', 'wondering', 'not', 'might', 'someday', 'find', 'romantically', 'involved', 'person', 'who', 'entirely', 'unrepentant', 'having', 'stabbed', 'someone', 'heart', 'knife.It', 'impossible', 'be', 'deeply', 'involved', 'film', 'moral', 'order', 'are', 'simply', 'left', 'watching', 'large', 'number', 'people', 'pursuing', 'interests', 'reason', 'care', 'what']",N/A
590164,A6FIAB28IS79,B00005JKNF,Samuel Chell,"[6, 8]","Altman followers will have no trouble seeing in ""Gosford Park"" the auteur's favorite themes and devices--a preoccupation with time and place over ""story,"" an intersecting repertory of actors whose various characters are subtly and gradually disclosed through their interaction, protracted shots with significant visual information planted in all corners of the screen, an audio track characterized by overlapping dialogue and multiple conversations.  Add to all this Altman's respect for actors who contribute their own ideas to the script and his ability to seize and incorporate the serendipitous, and the results can be purely exhilarating cinema.  At its best (""Nashville""), Altman's approach produces films that imitate and criticize life like few others, evoking spinetingling epiphanies during the film experience and indelible memories afterwards.  At its worst (""Ready to Wear,"" ""Kansas City"") the results are little more than tedious, meaningless exercises in cinematic self-indulgence.What distinguishes ""Gosford Park"" from much of Altman's previous work is the director's exercising of a much firmer hand over the proceedings.  Altman usually eschews film scores, preferring to go with source music (""Nashville"") or no music at all.  ""Gosford Park,"" on the other hand, is a heavily scored movie, a device that insures narrative form and plot continuity not to mention a ""melodramatic"" heightening of emotion felt by both characters and spectator.To describe the film as a satire on the crumbling of residual, anachronistic aristocratic values and class distinctions in the 20th century is to do it injustice.  True, Altman uses social distinctions, new  vs. old money, master vs. servant class, Hollywood actors who play roles for a living vs. the served and servants who live because of their roles.  And he throws in stereotypes of plot and character that somehow work--enlivening the proceedings while drawing both the satire and more subtle characterizations into sharper focus.But Altman's satire on class, British culture, and literary and film genres themselves are all merely vehicles for his exploration of characters, of their dreams and desires, and above all the consequences of repressed and thwarted desire.  If there's a flaw in the film, it's Altman's failure to bring out the degree to which even the most ""liberated"" of characters fall prey to their freedom.  ""Gosford Park"" leaves us with the picture of a servant class making touch with its own feelings, daring to imagine a life of expressed desires and personal happiness as a consequence.  Only the stinging depiction and indictment of the ruling class carry any hint that personal freedom has its own liabilities.""Gosford Park"" is not the epiphany that ""Nashville"" is, but it's a brilliant cinematic house of mirrors, casting reflections and meanings that can only multiply upon repeated viewings.",5,Incomparable Altman,1015804800,"03 11, 2002",2002,2883,"['Altman', 'followers', 'will', 'have', 'trouble', 'seeing', 'Gosford', 'Park', 'auteur', 'favorite', 'themes', 'devices', 'preoccupation', 'time', 'place', 'story', 'intersecting', 'repertory', 'actors', 'various', 'characters', 'are', 'subtly', 'gradually', 'disclosed', 'interaction', 'protracted', 'shots', 'significant', 'visual', 'information', 'planted', 'corners', 'screen', 'audio', 'track', 'characterized', 'overlapping', 'dialogue', 'multiple', 'conversations', 'Add', 'Altman', 'respect', 'actors', 'who', 'contribute', 'own', 'ideas', 'script', 'ability', 'seize', 'incorporate', 'serendipitous', 'results', 'can', 'be', 'purely', 'exhilarating', 'cinema', 'best', 'Nashville', 'Altman', 'approach', 'films', 'imitate', 'criticize', 'life', 'few', 'others', 'evoking', 'spinetingling', 'epiphanies', 'film', 'experience', 'indelible', 'memories', 'afterwards', 'worst', 'Ready', 'Wear', 'Kansas', 'City', 'results', 'are', 'little', 'more', 'tedious', 'meaningless', 'exercises', 'cinematic', 'self-indulgence.What', 'distinguishes', 'Gosford', 'Park', 'much', 'Altman', 'previous', 'work', 'director', 'exercising', 'much', 'firmer', 'hand', 'proceedings', 'Altman', 'usually', 'film', 'scores', 'preferring', 'go', 'source', 'music', 'Nashville', 'music', 'Gosford', 'Park', 'other', 'hand', 'heavily', 'scored', 'movie', 'device', 'narrative', 'form', 'plot', 'continuity', 'not', 'mention', 'melodramatic', 'heightening', 'emotion', 'felt', 'characters', 'spectator.To', 'describe', 'film', 'satire', 'crumbling', 'residual', 'anachronistic', 'aristocratic', 'values', 'class', 'distinctions', '20th', 'century', 'do', 'injustice', 'True', 'Altman', 'social', 'distinctions', 'new', 'vs.', 'old', 'money', 'master', 'vs.', 'servant', 'class', 'Hollywood', 'actors', 'who', 'play', 'roles', 'living', 'served', 'servants', 'who', 'live', 'roles', 'stereotypes', 'plot', 'character', 'somehow', 'work', 'enlivening', 'proceedings', 'drawing', 'satire', 'more', 'subtle', 'characterizations', 'sharper', 'focus.But', 'Altman', 'satire', 'class', 'British', 'culture', 'literary', 'film', 'genres', 'are', 'merely', 'vehicles', 'exploration', 'characters', 'dreams', 'desires', 'consequences', 'repressed', 'thwarted', 'desire', 'flaw', 'film', 'Altman', 'failure', 'bring', 'out', 'degree', 'even', 'most', 'liberated', 'characters', 'fall', 'prey', 'freedom', 'Gosford', 'Park', 'picture', 'servant', 'class', 'making', 'touch', 'own', 'feelings', 'daring', 'imagine', 'life', 'expressed', 'desires', 'personal', 'happiness', 'consequence', 'Only', 'stinging', 'depiction', 'indictment', 'ruling', 'class', 'carry', 'hint', 'personal', 'freedom', 'own', 'liabilities', 'Gosford', 'Park', 'not', 'epiphany', 'Nashville', 'brilliant', 'cinematic', 'house', 'mirrors', 'casting', 'reflections', 'meanings', 'can', 'only', 'multiply', 'repeated', 'viewings']",N/A

590168,A13D1WTFEMS9VH,B00005JKNF,Scorpio69,"[23, 45]","The night before I saw ""Gosford Park"" I saw the wonderful French film, ""Amelie"". Since most American audiences don't speak French, the film was appropriately subtitled in English. ""Gosford Park"" should have been similarly subtitled, because it is nearly impossible to understand the many half-mumbled and otherwise inaudible snippets of dialog that let you in on what the heck this movie is supposed to be about! After the first thirty minutes I was sorely tempted to leave, but since I'd paid my 9 bucks I thought I'd stay and see if I could piece together anything from what WAS intelligible from the mouths of the horribly boring cast of characters. According to Altman, he didn't want to ""serve"" anything to the audience; rather, it is up to the audience to work for it - i.e., zero in on a given character in a scene and thereby (according to Altman) ""get into"" the picture. Might be a novel idea, if there was ANYONE in this film who had ANYTHING attention-grabbing to say! The problem is, upstairs or downstairs, there's not an interesting one in the bunch. If tedium is your cup of tea, then I suppose you might find some redeeming value in this bland ensemble concoction. Apparently one is supposed to infer that there is something of interest in the film because of the particular historical/social setting or the indisputably able cast, rather than there actually being something of interest happening on the screen. What a pretentious load of baloney! I saw this film only because of the high praise from the critics. Last time I let those bozos make a difference in my choice of films. I read Roger Ebert's four-star review only after I saw the movie. Here's his idea of ""scene-stealing"" repartee:When Hollywood star Ivor Novello (Jeremy Northam) entertains after dinner with one song, and then another, and then another, and shows no sign of stopping, [Maggie] Smith crisply asks, ""Do you think he'll be as long as he usually is?"" and then stage-whispers, ""Don't encourage him.""A veritable knee-slapper, eh what?! HA HA HA!Of Altman, he writes:""As a director he has never been willing to settle for plot; he is much more interested in character and situation...""Read: If you're looking for something as trivial as a plot in this turkey, you'll just have to come up with one on your own. The director was simply too busy with more important things - like, letting the actors do as they wanted and declaring that whatever the result, it would be just fine. It is reminiscent of the approach Albert Brooks took in his hilarious ""mockumentary"" film, ""Real Life"". It didn't work there, either - but that was the joke!Of the screenplay, Ebert writes:""Like guests at a big party, we are confused when we first arrive: Who are all these people? By the end, we know.""The problem is, by the time we do know, WE DON'T CARE! Who gives a rats a$$ about a bunch of snooty and petty British aristocrats and their sniveling and petty servants? Any attempt to try to ""explain"" the supposed ""depth"" of this cinematic sleeping pill to the rest of us poor dumb slobs by high-minded critics and Altman apologists is both condescending and pathetic.

He hasn't HAD any fine work! He was a one-hit-wonder with ""THE PLAYER"" but all of his other films were terrible.But I'm not prejudice to Robert Altman films. I gave this one a chance. It has no characters I care about, an ending that just seems like they ran out of money so they had to stop, and a plot shamelessly ripped off of the far superior ""CLUE"". The story involves a huge group of people going to a large country mansion for a shooting party. One of them is a producer for the 30's and 40's ""Charlie Chan"" mystery films, who's next film ""CHARLIE CHAN IN LONDON"" begins to mysteriously come to life as one of the guests is both poisioned and stabbed.So, whodunnit? Well, we don't exactly find out, so it doesn't particularly matter who did it.Another thing I don't like about this movie is all the meaningless scenes. The film could have been cut down to an hour and a half if they could have spared ten or twenty meaningless conversations like ""This tea is cold, could I have another one...? No! Not in that glass! You're not even Scottish!""Not to mention that in ""CLUE"", you couldn't tell if the killer was male or female, leaving us guessing. But in ""GOSFORD PARK"", we not only see that the killer is a man, but that he's also wearing pen-striped pants! A trait that only belongs to one person in the whole movie!!!In closing, if you're intrested in the way Europeans lived their lives during the 30's, or would like to see nice scenery (which this film does have quite a bit of), go out and see this film.

Well, Gosford park was NOTHING like ""Upstairs Downstairs.""The plot? Difficult to describe! A whole group of titled gentry converge on an English mansion for some inexplicable purpose. During their time there, a rich unlikable man is murdered. What follows is vigorous interviews by a bumbling constable and his competent sidekick, and endless endless, mindless scenes with coarse crude servants, and rich snobbish nobility. Is this supposed to be a plot? I don't think so.While I was prepared to like Gosford Park, I found the plot way too meandering for my taste. The protagonist, Mary, is ill-defined, and the rest of the cast just seem to show up at odd points throughout the story with no apparent reason or motive, or reason.Even the killer, seemed to lack sufficient motive to do the deed. By the end of this film I admit I found myself counting the seconds until it ended. Gratuitous sex scenes were added to produce the ""R"" rating which could quite easily have been edited out, and had no bearing on the story. Overall...I consider Gosford Park to be frustrating.

Each rich soul has a dedicated, personal servant to be pandered by. And the movie's various funny moments derive from this now-comical-but-then-a-reality setting.The narrative is Altman-fabulous and lined with a liberal dose of wry humour:- ""So you think he's the murderer?""- ""No, even worse. He's an actor.""...and a fair amount of cultural barbs:- ""Stop snivelling, they'll think you're Italian!"", or,- ""You Brits don't have a sense of humour, do you?"" and the ever so politely delivered retort, ""We do, when something is funny, Sir.""After only the hour and 10 minutes of introductions to the various characters, when we do hit the crime, the turtle pace quickens a notch. I can see why this long pregnant wait leaves some viewers wraught. But personally I found this Agatha Christie-esque unravelling of each individual's idiosynchrasies fascinating, because it sets up a ""motive"" for several of our characters. It's twice as much fun if many people COULD have executed the murder.Enter: Stephen Fry as a very Sherlock Holmes-esque investigator, pipe and trenchcoat and all. Kind of builds up hope for a thrilling investigation, doesn't it. Trouble is, none is forthcoming. Fry made do with a small-fry part really.No, the murder is instead solved in a somewhat lame manner, by one of the inquisitive maids. This is the biggest gyp of the film and the reason I take off the 1 full delicious star. I could see the ending coming from a mile.Overall a stylishly told story, with some very good moments. I found the subtitles very handy as the Scottish accents, and the occasional argot, are a bit tough to comprehend.Don't really set yourself up for a murder mystery who-dun-it, which it could be argued it is, in a half-baked sort of a way, but that is probably a plus: this is not your run of the mill murder mystery but an off-beat movie that'll nonetheless hold your attention.",4,A MIXED BAG.,1069027200,"11 17, 2003",2003,2349,"['tough', 'fault', 'hordes', 'viewers', 'who', 'found', 'movie', 'dreadfully', 'unbearable', 'waste', 'time', 'utter', 'tripe', 'etc', 'could', ""n't"", 'tell', 'footboy', 'butler', 'valet', 'could', 'surely', 'feel', 'was', 'one', 'long', 'movie', ""n't"", 'mean', 'not', 'deliciously', 'watchable', 'feast', 'film', 'making.Setting', 'bunch', 'woefully', 'uppetty', 'folks', 'meet', 'up', 'humongous', 'country', 'house', 'Britain', 'week', 'shooting', 'pigeons', 'one', 'affluent', 'pursuits', 'rich', 'soul', 'dedicated', 'personal', 'servant', 'be', 'pandered', 'movie', 'various', 'funny', 'moments', 'derive', 'now-comical-but-then-a-reality', 'setting.The', 'narrative', 'Altman-fabulous', 'lined', 'liberal', 'dose', 'wry', 'humour', 'think', 'murderer', 'No', 'even', 'worse', 'actor', 'fair', 'amount', 'cultural', 'barbs', 'Stop', 'snivelling', ""'ll"", 'think', ""'re"", 'Italian', 'Brits', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'sense', 'humour', 'do', 'ever', 'so', 'politely', 'delivered', 'retort', 'do', 'when', 'something', 'funny', 'Sir', 'only', 'hour', '10', 'minutes', 'introductions', 'various', 'characters', 'when', 'do', 'hit', 'crime', 'turtle', 'pace', 'notch', 'can', 'see', 'why', 'long', 'pregnant', 'wait', 'viewers', 'wraught', 'personally', 'found', 'Agatha', 'Christie-esque', 'unravelling', 'individual', 'idiosynchrasies', 'fascinating', 'up', 'motive', 'several', 'characters', 'twice', 'as', 'much', 'fun', 'many', 'people', 'COULD', 'have', 'executed', 'murder.Enter', 'Stephen', 'Fry', 'very', 'Sherlock', 'Holmes-esque', 'investigator', 'pipe', 'trenchcoat', 'Kind', 'builds', 'hope', 'thrilling', 'investigation', ""n't"", 'Trouble', 'none', 'forthcoming', 'Fry', 'made', 'do', 'small-fry', 'part', 'really.No', 'murder', 'instead', 'solved', 'somewhat', 'lame', 'manner', 'one', 'inquisitive', 'maids', 'biggest', 'gyp', 'film', 'reason', 'take', '1', 'full', 'delicious', 'star', 'could', 'see', 'ending', 'coming', 'mile.Overall', 'stylishly', 'told', 'story', 'very', 'good', 'moments', 'found', 'subtitles', 'very', 'handy', 'Scottish', 'accents', 'occasional', 'argot', 'are', 'bit', 'tough', 'comprehend.Do', ""n't"", 'really', 'set', 'up', 'murder', 'mystery', 'who-dun-it', 'could', 'be', 'argued', 'half-baked', 'sort', 'way', 'probably', 'plus', 'not', 'run', 'mill', 'murder', 'mystery', 'off-beat', 'movie', ""'ll"", 'nonetheless', 'hold', 'attention']",N/A

It is inhabited by William McCordle (Michael Gambon), his wife Sylvia (Kristen Scott-Thomas) and their daughter Isobel (Camilla Rutherford). William and Sylvia's not very happy marriage is a fairly flagrant exchange of financial prosperity for social standing as prior to it she was immensely posh but broke, while he was not posh at all but extremely rich thanks to the factories he owns. They are hosting a weekend social gathering to do a spot of shooting and have invited mainly her relatives, his being presumably too common. The exception is his cousin Ivor Novello (Jeremy Northam) who belongs to the new Hollywood aristocracy (not that that cuts much social ice hereabouts - the servants are overawed, their masters sniffy) and his film director friend from Hollywood Morris Weissman (Bob Balaban) who has got himself invited along with a view to researching a planned movie about toffs together with the later's valet Henry Denton (Ryan Phillippe). Also along are Sylvia's sister Louisa Stocksbridge (Geraldine Somerville) accompanied by her arrogantly patrician war hero husband Raymond (Charles Dance) and his valet Robert Parks (Clive Owen); her other sister Lavinia (Natasha Wightman) rather less successfully married off to the weak and financially straightened Anthony (Tom Hollander) who is as desperate to get William to invest in his schemes for a boot factory in the Sudan as William is determined to do no such thing; her nephew Freddie Nesbit who is also in dire straits for money and divides his time between sucking up to William in the hope of being offered employment and bullying his wife Mabel (Caudie Blakely), who has also been married for her money, but having had less that was hoped, is now treated with merciless scorn and contempt; Sylvia's stingy and supercilious aunt Constance Trentham (Maggie Smith) and her maid Mary MacCeachran (Kelly MacDonald).  That's about it upstairs about from a couple of additional young fellows Lord Rupert Standish (Laurence Fox) and Jeremy Blond (Trent Ford) who show up late and never really integrate successfully into either the social gathering or the film except that the former seems to have his eye on Isobel or at least what she stands to inherit inheritance.You might perhaps think that was already complicated enough. But in the meantime Parks and Maceachran arrive downstairs to find themselves in the midst of a huge army of servants presided over by housekeeper Mrs Wilson (Helen Mirren) and alcoholic butler Jennings (Alan Bates) prominent among whom are head cook Mrs Croft (Eileen Atkins); head housemaid (and William's mistress), Elsie (Emily Watson), William's valet Probert (Derek Jacobi), the lecherous footman George (Richard E. Grant) and the nymphomaniac kitchen maid Dorothy (Sophie Thompson). All this huge array of people mingle, gossip, intrigue their way though an evening and the following day until, the second evening, Sir William turns up murdered in his study, bringing the law onto the scene in the form of the drolly moronic Inspector Thompson (Stephen Fry) and his rather less dimwitted underling Constable Dexter (Ron Webster).Smith, Mirren, Gambon, Scott-Thomas, Jacobi, Bates, Dance, Watson, Grant, Atkins, Fry... Some cast. The British film A-list is very bit as talented as their American counterparts but, sadly for them, an awful lot less expensive, to the point where it is possible for a movie such as this to simply buy them all up as a huge job lot. All are perfectly cast and superb with the exception I fear of Fry whose bumbling clod of an Inspector is mildly amusing but completely unbelievable and belongs in a very different, less serious and naturalistic sort of comedy than is this: like Geraldine Chalplin in 'Nashville' he is the comic touch that doesn't really work. In such a sprawling typically Altmanesque ensemble piece it should be impossible for any actor to dominate but happily no one has explained this to Maggie Smith whose magnificently funny performance effortlessly steal the movie.It's a hugely enjoyable movie superbly put together. Altman has much with age. It lacks the satirical savagery of a `Nashville' or a `Short Cuts' and a clearly deeply critical take on the puffery, snobbery and often terrible cruelty of this ferociously hierarchical class system is tempered and slightly undermined by a slight but definitely perceptible unmistakeable nostalgic sneaking regard for this nice stable ordered but clearly dying world where everybody knew where they belonged and (mostly) stayed there. So it's an at once contemptuous and affectionate, despairing and humane picture of a bunch of toffs and their servants in the years between the wars with a scene in the middle where they all go off shooting birds in the local woods: it's certainly natural to suppose all this involves considerably more than a nodding glance back to Renoir's `Rules of the Game'. If that is Altman's model of course he hasn't matched it but he's nonetheless made a richly intricate, intelligent and highly enjoyable film.",5,Intelligent and highly pleasurable period

As in so many Altman movies, the cast is composed of many well known actors.  In this case it works, the plot is well constructed and the screenplay well executed.  It behooves the viewer to take time to watch the first hour of the movie as it painstakingly lays down the foundation of the story and establishes the characters--this is not a thriller that will rocket you from scene to scene.  It is an old-fashioned mystery crafted by a master film-maker.The story unfolds over several days of shooting in a beautiful country mansion in England during the 1930's.  The class system still holds sway in this setting where many of the guests bring their own personal servants.  The problematic nature of the relationship between the haves and have-nots is the central problem  of the story and results in murder.Among many fine performances is Maggie Smith, a dagger tongued elderly harpy who can be heard in almost any scene languidly complaining about everything.  Derek Jacoby is touching in the few moments he is seen on screen.  Stephen Fry is unctiously amusing as a bumbling inspector, though he does chew the scenery a bit.  Helen Mirren provides her usual amazingly adept performance, playing the iron-fisted housekeeper whose emotions are kept out of sight except to us, her audience.This is a very fine movie--take the time to watch and savor.",5,An excellent murder mystery with an endearingly old-fashioned pace!,1148256000,"05 22, 2006",2006,1422,"['Gosford', 'Park', 'was', 'directed', 'conceived', 'great', 'Robert', 'Altman', 'so', 'many', 'Altman', 'movies', 'cast', 'composed', 'many', 'well', 'known', 'actors', 'case', 'plot', 'well', 'constructed', 'screenplay', 'well', 'executed', 'viewer', 'take', 'time', 'watch', 'first', 'hour', 'movie', 'painstakingly', 'foundation', 'story', 'characters', 'not', 'thriller', 'will', 'rocket', 'scene', 'scene', 'old-fashioned', 'mystery', 'crafted', 'master', 'film-maker.The', 'story', 'unfolds', 'several', 'days', 'shooting', 'beautiful', 'country', 'mansion', 'England', '1930', 'class', 'system', 'still', 'sway', 'setting', 'where', 'many', 'guests', 'bring', 'own', 'personal', 'servants', 'problematic', 'nature', 'relationship', 'haves', 'have-nots', 'central', 'problem', 'story', 'results', 'murder.Among', 'many', 'fine', 'performances', 'Maggie', 'Smith', 'dagger', 'tongued', 'elderly', 'harpy', 'who', 'can', 'be', 'heard', 'almost', 'scene', 'languidly', 'complaining', 'everything', 'Derek', 'Jacoby', 'touching', 'few', 'moments', 'seen', 'screen', 'Stephen', 'Fry', 'unctiously', 'amusing', 'bumbling', 'inspector', 'chew', 'scenery', 'bit', 'Helen', 'Mirren', 'usual', 'amazingly', 'adept', 'performance', 'playing', 'iron-fisted', 'housekeeper', 'emotions', 'are', 'kept', 'sight', 'audience.This', 'very', 'fine', 'movie', 'take', 'time', 'watch', 'savor']",N/A

More a study of the English class system than a murder mystery, I found my attention was split between too many subplots and minor characters. This technique usually works for Altman (e.g., 'Short Cuts' and `The Player') but it relies on the audience really engaging with the material. The central plot which might have held our attention and brought the stories together here - the murder - arrives far too late. It feels like an afterthought. Happily, the performances redeem the film, with Maggie Smith in particular doing a faultless job. She was surely robbed of her third Oscar by Jennifer Connolly who wasn't even nominated in the right category - surely Connolly she should have been up for `Best Actress in a Leading Role'? Most astonishing of all is that Julian Fellowes took home the Oscar for writing this when every other nominated screenplay - `Memento', `Amelie', `The Royal Tenenbaums' and `Monster's Ball' - showed more skill, more innovation and more originality.

It kept moving so you didn't get bored but also entertained you. It is worth seeing. I was shocked to see Ryan Phillipe in it. Clive Owen always seems to over power his characters with his deep voice and very confident demeanor but he was so thin back then.The drawbacks for me were1) I cannot understand what some of those people were saying with their thick accents (even after seeing it 2 times), especially the daughter that was sleeping with that one woman's blond husband.2) I think it is weaselly of Hollywood (even if it may be due to free trade pacts) to ""throw an American"" in a British setting just because it is an American film. Americans don't have to be everywhere.3) It had too many minor characters getting in the way to where I was asking ""Who is that?"". I don't mean the extras . . . obviously there was a need for them . . . it was a mansion with lots of ""help"" running around. I mean the blond guy and black headed guy who came late. Who were they? And the one maid who swore her allegiance to the drunken head butler. Who was she? What was all of that about? And for that matter what was the drunken head butler's problem? And which was the head butler? The drunk at the end or the older blond headed guy sobbing over the dead body? It was a little confusing. But not enough to be a distraction. Maybe some of those other characters mentioned who they were and I just couldn't understand them.4) It seems that all movies like this (British, set in a previous error, of high society, very Hollywood centric, etc) (e.g. A Room with a View, Another Country, Atonement, Damaged, etc) seem to insist on showing British folks fornicating in stairways, libraries, cellars, basements, bushes, weeds, fields, etc. Perhaps the point is that they are not as sophisticated and refined as they pretend.  But does it have to be a part of every one of these movies? Showing the kitchen maid and that black headed dude doing it in the kitchen and then in some random servant's room etc didn't add anything here.5) And the staid examples of the snobby rich being mean to the lowly poor.

590187,ACCEC9E3BDSPR,B00005JKNF,Tallulah,"[8, 13]","Opinions are sharply divided in this film, and I can see why.  First of all I have to say that it was very unfortunate that it was marketed as a murder mystery because it isn't.  Sure, there's a murder, but that's treated as hardly important at all.  So if you want murder in the 1930s, read Agatha Christie.Secondly, maybe I'm just dumb, but I could hardly keep track of all the characters, especially the upper-class ones (was this meant to be an ironic comment or something?  How all the upper-class people are vapid conformists?)  There were too many brown-haired rich women and too many men in suits and it just got really confusing.  For this reason, I didn't really enjoy the upper-class scenes because I couldn't work out how people related to each other or why they were saying things or...or anything.The working-class scenes were much better and are the main reason why I'm giving this movie 3 stars.  It really brought home to me how unfair the class system was and the contrast between the lives of the servants and their employers.This movie could have used some cutting.  I'm sorry, but it could.  No matter how interesting characters are (and these weren't THAT interesting) you can't expect everything they do to be interesting.  Any scene they have should advance the story.  That was my main problem with this movie - I like something where plot is considered as well as character.I was sickened to see all the reviews here which act patronising and say 'oh, if you didn't like this movie you're a dumb brainless hick who only wants explosions and sex.'  I resent that implication!  Just because someone doesn't like the same things you do does not mean they are stupid - honestly, that's the sort of thing you teach little children.Anyway, if you REALLY like things set in the 1930s, or if you're interested in class differences, or if you don't like fast-paced films, Gosford Park may be for you.

When a series of wealthy Brits and Americans gather at this estate one weekend to congregate, have dinner, chat, and shoot birds, a murder takes place. Like many Altman films such as ""MASH"" and ""Nashville"", ""Gosford Park"" relies more on characterization than plot, although the stories are quite good. The major plot of the film centers on the class conflict between those that are rich and those that work for the rich; whenever you pit the rich against the poor high drama will occur. While viewing this film I couldn't help but feeling like I was part of the movie; the movie engages you as your attracted to at least one of the characters. The ensemble cast consists of many of the best British actors out there including Kristin Scott Thomas, Oscar winners Maggie Smith and Helen Mirren, and Emily Watson and a young American actor named Ryan Phillipe who proved he could hold his own against this high caliber group of actors.

590190,A3D6TFYRMIV3ZL,B00005JKNF,Themis-Athena,"[150, 164]","Well, strictly speaking he doesn't of course - Robert Altman never simply tags onto an established genre; he plays with it and makes it his own by turning it upside down.  So, while the idea for ""Gosford Park"" may have been inspired by murder mysteries ""Christie style"" and by the likes of ""Brideshead Revisited"" and the BBC series about the Bellamy's Eaton Square household, we leave familiar territory the moment we enter the estate ... through the servants' entrance; for although large parts of the action take place ""upstairs,"" it is manifestly told from a ""downstairs"" perspective.Academy Award-winningly scripted by Julian Fellowes (himself a descendant of British nobility and therefore able to draw on manifold personal insights in creating the movie's characters), ""Gosford Park"" is primarily an examination of the unquestioningly accepted rules of the early 1930s' British class society:  where, beset by primogeniture and a lifestyle often beyond their means, an aristocrat's daughters and younger sons were compelled to marry rich to maintain their expected standard of living - making a marriage for love much less desirable than one for money, even to a disliked spouse, and a marriage for love almost akin to a crime if not combined with wealth -; where servants were a necessary element of the aristocracy's life, even if largely treated as non-persons, banished to the basement and not even allowed to speak if not spoken to when called upstairs by virtue of their duties (notwithstanding the almost friendly relationship often existing between members of the two classes outside the public eye); where the perfect servant's existence was a life so unrealized that it often resulted in an overbearing interest in all aspects of his employer's life and in a precise emulation of the latter's prejudices, standards and pecking orders; where nevertheless domestic service was an important finishing school, especially for girls, frequently employed as early as at 12 or 14 years of age; where both ""upstairs"" and ""downstairs"" the greatest transgression against social etiquette was the causation of any kind of scene, as *nothing* was to be talked about as if it were truly important - requiring an immediate return to form if a breach of decorum had occurred after all - and where minute behavioral patterns such as a person's habits in pouring milk for his tea unfailingly exposed him as a member of one particular class, try as he might to associate himself with another.  Yet, for all its observations, ""Gosford Park"" never judges: it takes each of its characters, and the entire unspoken ""upstairs-downstairs"" class arrangement at face value, leaving it up to its viewers to determine themselves what to make thereof.The movie is named for the estate of  Sir William McCordle (Michael Gambon) and wife Sylvia (Kristin Scott Thomas), who have invited friends and family to that most English of all country sports events - a shooting party.  And they have all come:  Lady Sylvia's aunt Constance Trentham (Maggie Smith), her sisters Louisa and Lavinia with husbands Lord Stockbridge and Commander Meredith (Geraldine Somerville, Natasha Wightman, Charles Dance and Tom Hollander), the Nesbitts (James Wilby and Claudie Blakley) and last but not least (real-life) actor Ivor Novello (Jeremy Northam, who also displays his outstanding vocal talent with several of Novello's songs), along with Hollywood director Morris Wiseman (Bob Balaban), in England for research on a projected ""Charlie Chan"" movie, and young Henry Denton (Ryan Philippe), whom Wiseman presents as his valet.  Yet, while Novello is the hosts' halfheartedly-tolerated relative, Wiseman and Denton are instantly identified as outsiders: Not only are they American, but Wiseman is Jewish (and thus, implicitly socially suspect), a vegetarian (making him even more suspect for ""fussing"" over his food) and swears on the telephone; and Denton is quickly branded disingenuous by the servants, particularly Lady Constance's young maid Mary (Kelly Macdonald) and Lord Stockbridge's valet Robert Parks (Clive Owen), only to incur even greater wrath both upstairs and downstairs when the full measure of his deception becomes apparent.Despised by his wife and aristocratic in-laws and also, for reasons of their own, by his own staff, primarily housekeeper Jane Wilson and cook Elizabeth Croft (Helen Mirren and Eileen Atkins), Sir William is found murdered after the second night's dinner.  Enter Inspector Thompson (Stephen Fry) - and the movie's delicious survey gains another dimension, now also taking on the mystery genre; playing with it in ""Charlie Chan"" and ""Pink Panther"" fashion, with inept policemen, matching background music and cliches turned on their head, such as the obligatory assembly of all suspects, which here occurs at the investigation's beginning, not at its end.While ""Gosford Park""'s many awards are undoubtedly deserved, most fitting of all is its outstanding cast's SAG ensemble award; as all actors, including the late, great Alan Bates (butler Jennings), Derek Jacobi (Sir William's valet Probert), Richard E. Grant (first footman George) and Emily Watson (housemaid Elsie, Sir William's secret paramour and the only person grieving his death) put aside their claims to genuine starring roles in the interest of the ensemble's achievement.  In addition to Robert Altman's, his son/production designer Stephen's and Julian Fellowes's painstaking attention to even the smallest set detail - including a king's ransom in tapestry and authentic vintage jewelry - and the counsel of several advisors with real-life service experience, all actors thoroughly researched the tenets of their roles; enabling them to respond in supreme fashion to Altman's preferred style of directing, which favors spontaneity, ""mistakes"" (often actually a movie's greatest moments), constantly moving cameras with shifting focus and overlaying, partly ad-libbed conversations over strict adherence to the script.  The movie is jam-packed with information, each morsel provided only once; therefore, you not only should but actually must watch it several times to pick up on all the details you will necessarily miss initially.  This is not a film for casual viewers, nor for fans of primarily plot-driven stories - but it is strongly recommended to those who appreciate delicate social comment and exquisitely-drawn characters.Also recommended:The Shooting PartyHowards End - The Merchant Ivory CollectionThe Remains of the Day (Special Edition)Brideshead Revisited (25th Anniversary Collector's Edition)Upstairs,

590191,A3M2WW0PO34B94,B00005JKNF,thornhillatthemovies.com,"[4, 4]","Sir William (Michael Gambon) and Lady Sylvia (Kirstin Scott Thomas) McCordle host a shooting party at their country home. During the weekend, the lives of the various servants and guest interact and have an impact on the weekend. Also, over the course of the weekend, Sir William is murdered and many people appear to have motive for the murders. Among the various guests: Countess Trentham (Maggie Smith), an elderly dowager and financial drain on Sir William, Lord and Lady Stockbridge (Charles Dance and Geraldine Sommerville), brother and sister-in-law of William, each of whom is interested in the McCordles, Ivor Novello (Jermey Northam), star of the Silent screen and Morris Weissman (Bob Balaban), a Hollywood producer. The various servants include: Jennings (Alan Bates), the McCordle's butler, Mrs. Wilson (Helen Mirren), the housekeeper, Mrs. Croft (Eileen Atkins), the head cook, Probert (Derek Jacobi), Sir William's valet, Elsie (Emily Watson), a housemaid, George (Richard E. Grant), First Footman, Robert Parks (Clive Owen), Lord Stockbridge's valet and Henry Denton (Ryan Phillipe), M.r Weissman's valet.""Gosford Park"", the newest film from director Robert Altman is a very engaging, very well-made film about the lives of these people. As the film progresses, you realize that the film is less about the murder that takes place over the weekend and more about the class differences between the two sets of people. It quickly becomes apparent that there really is no difference between the Upstairs and the Downstairs people. Certain people receive different treatment with respect to their birth and upbringing. Also, due to the amount of fooling around between the two groups, it seems fairly silly to have one person referred to as Lord or Lady when they are perfectly happy to jump into the sack with a footman or maid.The fact that the mystery is not a primary factor is made very clear in two ways. Mr. Weissman (Bob Balaban) soon reveals that he is a producer of the Charlie Chan movies and is working on a new film called ""Charlie Chan in London"". He is asked to tell the group about it, but won't reveal the ending. As he describes the film, we realize that the film he is describing is the film we are watching. I don't know if you have ever seen a Charlie Chan film, but the outcome of these films is rarely based on any detective or police work. Soon, Inspector Thompson (Stephen Fry) enters the picture. A bumbling idiot, he is clearly overpowered by the class of people he is dealing with.""Park"" is filled with virtually every British actor currently working and each is very good. The sheer magnitude of the characters would seem to suggest that many of them would end up being two dimensional. However, almost every character has something going on, which helps to define them and provide interest to the story. Certainly, some characters become more prevalent and integral to the story, but Altman has a way of bringing a character into the picture at just the right moment to renew our interest in them.Maggie Smith is, as always, brilliant. As the elderly dowager, she uses her place and title to full advantage, and seems to love everything about her life, except for the size of her allowance. Just as she is commenting about the ineptitude of her personal maid, Mary Macreachran (Kelly McDonald), she makes an aside that she is very cheap, than goes on to talk about her state of financial affairs. Jeremy Northam and Bob Balaban provide the other standouts in the cast. Northam, playing Ivor Novello, an actual silent film star, seems genuinely perplexed by the state of his career and takes to singing one song after another. Bob Balaban plays Morris Weissman, a film producer from Hollywood, whom the kitchen staff soon finds out is a vegetarian.The cast of actors playing the staff is generally more interesting. Alan Bates heads up the service staff as Jennings, the head butler. He maintains a tight grip on the household with the help of Mrs. Wilson (Helen Mirren), the housekeeper. Mirren brings an iron rule to the role but also makes the character sympathetic and interesting in small, interesting ways. Ms. Wilson and Mrs. Croft (Eileen Atkins), the head cook, seem to have a small feud of power going on. Each character has secrets which are revealed in subtle ways. Clive Owen, as Stockbridge's valet, provides a quiet force in the servant's quarters and his presence eventually shakes things up. Derek Jacobi and Richard E. Grant also play members of the staff, adding to the mix.Ryan Phillipe also appears in the film as the Scottish valet to Morris Weissman (Bob Balaban). At first, his accent seems very 'actorly', as though someone who studied the accent for a bit suddenly thinks they can do it. Another character comments on the accent and soon we realize that perhaps he is not everything he seems. Phillipe is OK, but he is outmatched by every other actor in the film both in skill and physical presence. It smacks of a desperate attempt by the filmmakers to attract a portion of the American audience that never would go to a film like this. As his character becomes more clear, it also appears as though the filmmakers are trying to create a plausible excuse for their own actions in casting him.As the film progresses, Altman seemlessly weaves back and forth between the characters and their developing relationships, revealing little bits and then moving on. This manages to keep the cumbersome film and cast of characters fresh and to maintain our interest, while helping us identify the various players.""Gosford Park"" is filled with interesting characters

590193,A176IA89VGH46M,B00005JKNF,Todd Bovair,"[4, 5]","Well so am I! That's why this movie was such a great pleasure to watch. Gosford Park is a murder mystery set in a countryside mansion in England. I read in a previous review that the movie is dumb and predictable. Obviously, that reviewer prefers SMART and non-formula movies like 'Stealth'! PUH-LEASE!Gosford Park is EXCELLENTLY scripted, and is not a typical Hollywood-type mystery at all. It will have you TRULY guessing until the very end. In addition, the cast is AMAZING, and the acting is beyond first-rate. Do not expect lame unrealistic Hollywood-type action scenes. This movie portrays the aftermath of a murder pretty realistically. Gosford Park makes my all-time Top 10 Movies list.More than likely, if you love the yearly 'summer blockbuster' that Hollywood churns out (again, like 'Stealth'), you are a lemming, and will think Gosford Park is boring. You will not like it. However, if you hate how many dumb movies Hollywood makes these days, then give Gosford Park a try. You WILL love this movie.One final note: The movie is set in England, and utilizes English and Scottish actors, complete with real accents. If you find it hard to understand accents, you may find it helpful to watch the movie with the subtitles on, as the soundtrack has a very real-life feel to it, with many conversations overlapping each other. The subtitles are quite good, and will help you hear all the nuances of the coversations.HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!",5,Are you tired of the dumb movies that Hollywood is churning out?...,1136246400,"01 3, 2006",2006,1443,"['Well', 'so', 'am', 'why', 'movie', 'was', 'such', 'great', 'pleasure', 'watch', 'Gosford', 'Park', 'murder', 'mystery', 'set', 'countryside', 'mansion', 'England', 'read', 'previous', 'review', 'movie', 'dumb', 'predictable', 'Obviously', 'reviewer', 'prefers', 'SMART', 'non-formula', 'movies', ""'Stealth"", 'PUH-LEASE', 'Gosford', 'Park', 'EXCELLENTLY', 'scripted', 'not', 'typical', 'Hollywood-type', 'mystery', 'will', 'have', 'TRULY', 'guessing', 'very', 'end', 'addition', 'cast', 'AMAZING', 'acting', 'first-rate', 'Do', 'not', 'expect', 'lame', 'unrealistic', 'Hollywood-type', 'action', 'scenes', 'movie', 'aftermath', 'murder', 'pretty', 'realistically', 'Gosford', 'Park', 'all-time', 'Top', '10', 'Movies', 'list.More', 'likely', 'love', 'yearly', 'blockbuster', 'Hollywood', 'out', 'again', ""'Stealth"", 'are', 'lemming', 'will', 'think', 'Gosford', 'Park', 'boring', 'will', 'not', 'like', 'However', 'hate', 'how', 'many', 'dumb', 'movies', 'Hollywood', 'days', 'then', 'give', 'Gosford', 'Park', 'try', 'WILL', 'love', 'movie.One', 'final', 'note', 'movie', 'set', 'England', 'utilizes', 'English', 'Scottish', 'actors', 'complete', 'real', 'accents', 'find', 'hard', 'understand', 'accents', 'may', 'find', 'helpful', 'watch', 'movie', 'subtitles', 'soundtrack', 'very', 'real-life', 'feel', 'many', 'conversations', 'overlapping', 'other', 'subtitles', 'are', 'quite', 'good', 'will', 'help', 'hear', 'nuances', 'coversations.HIGHLY', 'RECOMMENDED']",N/A

590195,A3N0E03AQD128O,B00005JKNF,Tony Thomas,"[0, 4]","At first sight Gosford Park appears to be just another country weekend movie featuring British aristocracy and their hangers on with a murder thrown in.  That is not what this is. Beneath the tip of that iceberg of the rich and titled, roars a mighty engine of people working hard, getting little respect, and having lives of equal value, overlooked oppressed, but creators of all there is in this worldMy grandmother's friends from church were all women who sometime in their lives had been servants, whether they had become social workers, teachers, or house wives.  Inevitably, when they would come over after church, a discussion of &quot;their people&quot; they had worked for as servants would break out. It was always the same thing, of the incapacity of people used to paying people to do things to achieve simple tasks, look at things from common sense, and despite their self-images as beneficent employers how &quot;their people&quot; constantly overloaded them with tasks beyond their job, and had absolutely no concern or knowledge of their needs to take time off for personal or health reasons.  Sneaking and listening to them, I heard many rather dramatic things about movers and shakers in our town and the national from these old women.Not much changes. About 15 years ago, a friend who had been a writer and editor for years moved to California. Through an old high school friend, he landed a job working in the home of a very prominent movie star, a job that was supposed to get him set up financially and a job that would end up getting him in touch with people in the movies and the papers that could land him a job or provide contact for his own writing.  When, I went to visit him, he had the same kinds of stories and stupidities to tell that those ladies who were friends of my grandmother told. Moreover, no one would bother to talk to him about his writing and editing, because none of the people he would want to know about his work because none of them noticed him because he was a servant.In a superbly acted movie, with great roles for everyone, we see how this world operates. Altman's brilliance here is that all this is done in a human, compelling, often funny, sometimes gripping manner.On the DVD you will listen to the writer of the film explain how each thing you think may be a wild exaggeration, or some weird exception in the behavior of the upper classes was something he himself saw or heard friends and relatives say or do.Of course,  it is not just the servants in the big houses, but all the working people all around the world whose work is hidden, who needs are abused, who provide the basis for everything and get no recognition.

The servants and the served, two groups at the opposite extremes of social acceptance.Altman does a great job of showing how intertwined and dependant they are on each other.  The rich are often snobbish, self-absorbed and just plain mean.  But not always.  The servants are full of gossip about their employers, simpler (that might be arguable) and kinder.  But again, not always.Pride and lust, money and vengence and a lot petty squabbles end up being greatly entertaining.  Not in a soap opera fashion, but rather at sociological study of inter-relationships between classes.For me, the best moment is when the ""film star"" plays and sings at the piano with the aristocats who are bored with it while in the shadows of the hallways and staircases the servants are captivated by his music.  The cynical seen-it-all-before attitudes of the upper classes contrasted with the star-crossed servants who are willing to let themselves be entertained without constraints.I liked Altman's ""The Player"" as a comment on Hollywood and in a similar fashion, Gosford Park is his comment on class and society in England.

590201,A2KU5PG32H7QBN,B00005JKNF,"wannabemoviecritic ""wannabemoviecritic""","[2, 3]","What I like about this film is its class. It's so brilliantly directed that the flow of the story is never interrupted. It's balanced, it's witty, it's full of mystery and fun. And it never strays to the realm of the over-the-top murder tales that are full of larger-than-life characters and Clue-esque easy answers. And although very unique in many ways, it does have a somewhat basic storyline (which causes its originality to be much more impressive).A hierarchy of British nobility is visiting a couple in their mansion (and their servants are joining them during the ""vacation""). The husband of the hosting couple is a vile man with many secrets that too many of the servants know about (like his many sexual adventures with factory women, who would birth children he could care less about). These events from the past start to seep in and stir up in both the upstairs and downstairs of the old mansion and the murder mystery begins, without a prime suspect.The emotional undertone of the ""evil man,"" as we'll call him, and the relationship he has with a certain servant allows the film to be much more than a well-directed, well-written mystery. It's socially conscious and it will have you caring about each and every character in a certain way, which may cause some to have favorites (the cast is large enough to do so). I have not seen a film in recent memory that is so successful at pulling you in and getting you involved with the importance of the story as well as its plot. And this immensely advantageous quality is not only because of Robert Altman's direction, interweaving the various plot lines and characters seamlessly. It is also because of the screenplay.The writing, by Julian Fellows, is intelligent, clever and sometimes down-right funny! It allowed for scenes with many people talking at once to have key moments that you could absorb without the least bit of trouble. You'll know when you need to listen in, and you'll know when a line is meant to be comic relief, or something of that sort. Fellows deserved the Oscar (2001, for best Original Screenplay) completely.Don't forget the actors. The cast is a sprawling who's who of British (and two American) actors. It includes young soon-to-be-thespians such as Ryan Phillipe and Kelly McDonald, and another rising star: Clive Owen. But the film belongs to three women: Maggie Smith, Emily Watson, and, especially, Helen Mirren. All three never cease adding on layers to their characters, one of which could have suffered from being a cardboard cut-out of a person. Smith is hilarious, Watson does some great internal work, and so does Mirren, who has a killer scene toward the end of the film that will have you sobbing. All three were, in a word, amazing.Some may say the film stretches along to the point of causing boredom. But you must understand that most of the film is key to the ending, and you'll be sitting there during the credits proud of yourself for catching on. It's just that involving! And that may be the movie's only real flaw: it is too subtle for certain people to ""get."" Otherwise, the movie is brilliant, dare I say close to perfect? I do dare.

If only we had been allowed to get to know the most important characters more deeply.  If only we could have cared more about the murder victim.

In that movie the maids and butlers and housekeepers really do become real people for us, and we care immensely about what happens to them.  In contrast with that, the Gosford Park characters are rather two-dimensional, with a bit of 'cartoon' about them.  There's too much that's already familiar from any Agatha Christie story you've ever seen or read-- the villain who deserves to die, the back-stabbing spoiled children of the wealthy mansion owners, the society idols who refuse to acknowledge that their servants have feelings.A bit more time spent on each major character would have overcome this.

Regrettably, he didn't win the Oscar this year for Best Director which remains a bit of a mystery (pun intended) to me. ""Gosford Park"" is arguably his most ambitious work to date. To some viewers, the film meanders quite a bit for more than an hour, flittering back and forth between the frantic work pace and never-ending preparations of the downstairs household staff and their employers lush, opulent living and activities upstairs, all during the course of a shooting weekend in the English Countryside. The standout performances include a devilishly spoiled Maggie Smith (whose character as she puts it 'hasn't a snobbish bone in her body') and Kristin Scott Thomas as the lady of the manor whose icy demeanor is off-putting to most but quite attractive to young fellow posing as a servant (a sly and witty Ryan Phillipe). The murder mystery, it has been reported in the entertainment press, wasn't actually added to the film until about 6 weeks into the shoot but you would hardly know since the gradual buildup to that crescendo is so brilliant and almost off-handed! After watching this terrific cast of A-list actors scurry about thier daily activities and then settle into a game of bridge, Brandy, conversation and music (provided by the dashing and alternately grating Jeremy Northam at the piano) a blood-curdling scream from the study snaps everyone from their selfish state and thrusts the film forward to a surprising and satisfying finish. I won't give away more than that (in case you haven't seen it yet) but I will say that there is another tasty little subplot involving two downstairs service people (a magnificent Helen Mirren and Clive Owen). Special kudos to the set designers and costume department for a job well done and for some of the most lush cinematography in recent film history!Brilliant.",5,Intriguing.,1030579200,"08 29, 2002",2002,1928,"['money', 'director', 'working', 'today', 'better', 'what', 'do', 'huge', 'ensemble', 'Robert', 'Altman', 'Regrettably', 'did', ""n't"", 'win', 'Oscar', 'year', 'Best', 'Director', 'bit', 'mystery', 'pun', 'intended', 'Gosford', 'Park', 'arguably', 'most', 'ambitious', 'work', 'date', 'viewers', 'film', 'meanders', 'quite', 'bit', 'more', 'hour', 'flittering', 'back', 'forth', 'frantic', 'work', 'pace', 'never-ending', 'preparations', 'downstairs', 'household', 'staff', 'employers', 'lush', 'opulent', 'living', 'activities', 'upstairs', 'course', 'shooting', 'weekend', 'English', 'Countryside', 'standout', 'performances', 'include', 'devilishly', 'spoiled', 'Maggie', 'Smith', 'character', ""n't"", 'snobbish', 'bone', 'body', 'Kristin', 'Scott', 'Thomas', 'lady', 'manor', 'icy', 'demeanor', 'off-putting', 'most', 'quite', 'attractive', 'young', 'fellow', 'posing', 'servant', 'sly', 'witty', 'Ryan', 'Phillipe', 'murder', 'mystery', 'been', 'reported', 'entertainment', 'press', 'was', ""n't"", 'actually', 'added', 'film', '6', 'weeks', 'shoot', 'would', 'hardly', 'know', 'gradual', 'buildup', 'crescendo', 'so', 'brilliant', 'almost', 'off-handed', 'watching', 'terrific', 'cast', 'A-list', 'actors', 'scurry', 'thier', 'daily', 'activities', 'then', 'settle', 'game', 'bridge', 'Brandy', 'conversation', 'music', 'provided', 'dashing', 'alternately', 'grating', 'Jeremy', 'Northam', 'piano', 'blood-curdling', 'scream', 'study', 'everyone', 'selfish', 'state', 'film', 'forward', 'surprising', 'satisfying', 'finish', 'wo', ""n't"", 'give', 'away', 'more', 'case', 'have', ""n't"", 'seen', 'yet', 'will', 'say', 'tasty', 'little', 'subplot', 'involving', 'two', 'downstairs', 'service', 'people', 'magnificent', 'Helen', 'Mirren', 'Clive', 'Owen', 'Special', 'kudos', 'set', 'designers', 'costume', 'department', 'job', 'well', 'done', 'most', 'lush', 'cinematography', 'recent', 'film', 'history', 'Brilliant']",N/A

590207,A1SPB225CVTRUU,B00005JKNF,"Wing Lee ""filmfan""","[1, 3]","Gosford Park is a fabulous English film about a day in the lives of a bunch of aristocrats and the lower working class servants. The all-star ensemble features many A-list serious English actors including some of my favorites Emily Watson(house maid), Kristin Scott Thomas(the wife of a wealthy man), Helen Mirren(the housekeeper), and Maggie Smith(a super snob). Actually, Ryan Phillipe is also in it with a fake British accent. Other sophisticated character actors include Jeremy Northem, Clive Owen, Michael Gambon, and Stephen Fry as the police inspector.The story is about the little things that goes on during the day while everyone is getting ready for a grand party. There are secrets and backstabbings between the two classes in the house. For instance, Emily Watson is secretly having an affair with her master/empolyer. Helen Mirren is withholding her true identity from the son who never knew her. Kristin Scott Thomas is cheating on her husband. The seemingly worry-free Maggie Smith might have to face finiancial problems if her sponsor stops giving her allowances. Then someone gets murdered and the houseful of guests and staffs all panic....This film received numerous Oscar nominations, and both Maggie Smith and Helen Mirren were competitors in the best supporting actress cateogory. I think Smith was brilliant, because she really captured the essence of her character, but it's an unlikeable one. Helen Mirren stood out when she had her breakdown later in the film. She did a great job holding herself together until she couldn't take it anymore.I enjoyed this film tremendously, because it's funny, dramatic, suspenseful, and touching.

590208,AMMEMPM9MPS55,B00005JKNF,www.DavidLRattigan.com,"[1, 4]","Gosford Park feels like one of those all-star Agatha Christie mysteries of the seventies and eighties, and one half expects Peter Ustinov to make an appearance at any moment. This is far sharper and more involving, however, than any other films of that genre. As usual, Altman's concentration is on the intriguing characters, and the suspenseful and charged atmosphere stems from observing the interplay between them. The mystery is palpably present from the very beginning; we sense something malevolent looming in the atmosphere, but are watching every move in order to see just how it will be manifest. Every word spoken and action made is laden with potential significance; therein Altman provides the audience with a fascinating and gripping look into a world of believable characters where any moment conflict might erupt into something deadly.Altman spends most of the film building up to the main crime. Thereafter, everything is brought together convincingly and dramatically. Stephen Fry provides by far the film's most hilarious moments in his turn as a grossly incompetent police inspector.Part of the film's fascination lies in its period setting, which has a feel of authenticity, and also in the clashing of two worlds, that of servants and masters. The veneer of distance between the two worlds, contrasted with the reality of the complex interrelations between them, lends the film a certain ironic undertone.This is a film that requires repeated viewings, since there are subtle nuances that may not be noticed the first time around, not to mention such a wealth of characters and situations that one might well miss some of the plot details.",4,Involving period mystery,1026864000,"07 17, 2002",2002,1660,"['Gosford', 'Park', 'feels', 'one', 'all-star', 'Agatha', 'Christie', 'mysteries', 'seventies', 'eighties', 'one', 'half', 'Peter', 'Ustinov', 'make', 'appearance', 'moment', 'far', 'sharper', 'more', 'involving', 'however', 'other', 'films', 'genre', 'usual', 'Altman', 'concentration', 'intriguing', 'characters', 'suspenseful', 'charged', 'atmosphere', 'observing', 'interplay', 'mystery', 'palpably', 'present', 'very', 'beginning', 'sense', 'something', 'malevolent', 'looming', 'atmosphere', 'are', 'watching', 'move', 'order', 'see', 'just', 'how', 'will', 'be', 'manifest', 'word', 'spoken', 'action', 'made', 'laden', 'potential', 'significance', 'Altman', 'audience', 'fascinating', 'gripping', 'look', 'world', 'believable', 'characters', 'where', 'moment', 'conflict', 'might', 'erupt', 'something', 'deadly.Altman', 'most', 'film', 'building', 'up', 'main', 'crime', 'Thereafter', 'everything', 'brought', 'together', 'convincingly', 'dramatically', 'Stephen', 'Fry', 'far', 'film', 'most', 'hilarious', 'moments', 'turn', 'grossly', 'incompetent', 'police', 'inspector.Part', 'film', 'fascination', 'period', 'setting', 'feel', 'authenticity', 'also', 'clashing', 'two', 'worlds', 'servants', 'masters', 'veneer', 'distance', 'two', 'worlds', 'contrasted', 'reality', 'complex', 'interrelations', 'film', 'certain', 'ironic', 'undertone.This', 'film', 'repeated', 'viewings', 'are', 'subtle', 'nuances', 'may', 'not', 'be', 'noticed', 'first', 'time', 'around', 'not', 'mention', 'wealth', 'characters', 'situations', 'one', 'might', 'well', 'miss', 'plot', 'details']",N/A
