195928,A2BNNU4ELFKK4N,555212474X,MollyRK,"[15, 18]","Hands down, ""I'll Be Waving as You Drive Away"" is a classic in the ""Little House on the Prairie"" series and is something you'll definitely want to see if you're a fan of the show. Indeed, it is a critical turning point, both on the show and in the true-to-life books, and it launches some drastic changes in the entire Ingalls family. When fifteen-year-old Mary is stricken with blindness, it is her initial denial and her family's fear and guilt that makes for a very emotional first few months. Mary's parents send her to a top-notch school for the blind, where she refuses to learn at first but is pulled in the right direction by her patient teacher Adam Kendall. In time, they form a loving bond that will last forever, and Mary's character matures a hundred times over through her experience.This is a beautiful episode, and it is easy to see why actress Melissa Sue Anderson was nominated for an Emmy for her performance here as Mary. This entire show is filled with many memorable, touching, and sometimes shattering moments that test a family's strength and inspire you. Anyone who takes the time to appreciate this wonderful show will definitely see that.As some of you may remember, this single-episode DVD was releaseda few years ago, back when Seasons 1 and 2 were brought to DVD for the first time. This episode, along with the pilot, ""Journey in the Spring,"" ""As Long as We're Together,"" and ""No Place Like Home"" all got their own individual DVD's. Many have criticized this as being a bad case of double dipping, which may be true, but it may also have simply been an attempt to accommodate those who didn't want to invest in the $50-per-season DVD sets and were content with just having some of the standout episodes for a lower price.Wonderful episode, superb TV series...highly recommended.",5,wonderful....great memories of a terrific show,1064016000,"09 20, 2003",2003,1809,"['Hands', 'down', ""'ll"", 'Be', 'Waving', 'Drive', 'Away', 'classic', 'Little', 'House', 'Prairie', 'series', 'something', ""'ll"", 'definitely', 'want', 'see', ""'re"", 'fan', 'show', 'Indeed', 'critical', 'turning', 'point', 'show', 'true-to-life', 'books', 'drastic', 'changes', 'entire', 'Ingalls', 'family', 'When', 'fifteen-year-old', 'Mary', 'stricken', 'blindness', 'initial', 'denial', 'family', 'fear', 'guilt', 'very', 'emotional', 'first', 'few', 'months', 'Mary', 'parents', 'send', 'top-notch', 'school', 'blind', 'where', 'learn', 'first', 'pulled', 'right', 'direction', 'patient', 'teacher', 'Adam', 'Kendall', 'time', 'form', 'loving', 'bond', 'will', 'last', 'forever', 'Mary', 'character', 'hundred', 'times', 'experience.This', 'beautiful', 'episode', 'easy', 'see', 'why', 'actress', 'Melissa', 'Sue', 'Anderson', 'was', 'nominated', 'Emmy', 'performance', 'here', 'Mary', 'entire', 'show', 'filled', 'many', 'memorable', 'touching', 'sometimes', 'shattering', 'moments', 'test', 'family', 'strength', 'inspire', 'Anyone', 'who', 'time', 'appreciate', 'wonderful', 'show', 'will', 'definitely', 'see', 'that.As', 'may', 'remember', 'single-episode', 'DVD', 'was', 'releaseda', 'few', 'years', 'ago', 'back', 'when', 'Seasons', '1', '2', 'were', 'brought', 'DVD', 'first', 'time', 'episode', 'pilot', 'Journey', 'Spring', 'As', 'Long', ""'re"", 'Together', 'Place', 'Home', 'got', 'own', 'individual', 'DVD', 'Many', 'have', 'criticized', 'being', 'bad', 'case', 'double', 'dipping', 'may', 'be', 'true', 'may', 'also', 'have', 'simply', 'been', 'attempt', 'accommodate', 'who', 'did', ""n't"", 'want', 'invest', '50-per-season', 'DVD', 'sets', 'were', 'content', 'just', 'having', 'standout', 'lower', 'price.Wonderful', 'episode', 'superb', 'TV', 'series', 'highly', 'recommended']",N/A
