549700,A2AFBVM5O9R09V,B00004STD9,"Arish ""A+""","[1, 3]","After hearing about this movie and hearing all the decent reviews about it. I really was looking for something exotic, Boy was I wrong! I can't make excuses or even try to make this out of something that was well put together. First of all there were alot of characters in the movie that were extremley irrelevant. I think what the writer was trying to do was put as many screwed up suspects in the movie as he could. Most of the characters were never main characters nor had depth in their character. There was one character/suspect/witness named Vickie. She was the closest to a main character and was the only person other than Helen Birkin that kept the movie interesting. And Vickie looked like a big ole ""Drag Queen"" that had two many psycological problems. She was a lesbian that was extremley promiscuous and very bold. But don't get excited people, even her character was limited and restricted. She had two good scenes the one with Helen Birkin the seduction that didn't go any where. And there is other scene where she blatantly walks in a strangers dressing room in a store and gives her pleasure. And even Vickie was pointless in the film because her character was eventually terminated, Go figure that? And the shrink basically served as a outlet to introduce more unnecessary sick characters, I guess, so that you can hear their stories as well. The only real tension or interesting plot was between the character witness Vickie and the cop(Ellen Birkin) that was it. Even that turned for the worst because, all the build up to what was supposed to be an attraction or seduction turned into a fiasco! So people if you are looking for lesbian action forget it, because it isn't here. They play it up and they disappoint you in this film. Then most of the women in the film were very hard looking and tired looking. I don't know what the directer was trying to convey in this film? Then the killer turns out to be someone that really didn't have a huge role in the film. And what is even more of a kicker Helen nor the cops never even had this person as a suspect. And what is even more of a kicker there wasn't any contact between the killer and the main characters. And the reasoning for the murders in the killers eyes was completley uproarious! The shrink which is played by (I forgot the guys name)he had no right counseling anyone because he was very strange himself. He was just as sick as the rest of the people in the movie. The ending was just completley stupid and uproarious ! Because there wasn't a previous relationship or connection between Helen or the Killer. So when Helen finally met up with this person there wasn't any tension or surprise! I don't know what this movie was meant for, but it definitley left me unsatisfied! If you are looking for a real sensual experience I recommend Blood Thirsty, Serpents Lair, Kate's Addiction, Body of Evidence, Poison Ivy 3 The New Seduction, Bound, Embrace of the Vampire, Damage, Habit,Life force,Lost Highway, Mulholland Drive,Basic Instinct (Uncut) and No strings Attached. These are very exotic and sensual films that have purpose and make sense! The only thing this movies serves as a lesson on child abuse and people with mental problems. The homes and location of the movie was gorgeous but that is it! And even that leaves question? How in the ... is a detective going to maintain and live in a mansion like that?

549701,A3S87ZOPB3UM9N,B00004STD9,atmj,"[5, 11]","Generally, I like Ellen Barkin in a movie, which is why I opted to see this.  However, this is not the Ellen Barkin energy, we are used to seeing as in the movies the &quot;Big Easy&quot; and &quot;Sea of Love&quot;.  She comes across as a worn-out detective, who slogs through the details of  this case hopping from one good guess to another.  You are never impressed  by her thought process nor do you appreciate the character she plays.  Also the Jennifer Anniston, unkept long shag has got to go.Peta Wilson  plays a major part in this story as a potential suspect/victim, however her  role is spotty and inconsistent at best.  Having seen her in &quot;La Femme  Nikita&quot;, I know her talents are much greater.Neither actress is  given enough story to latch onto.  Peta Wilson's character repeatedly gives  the detective played by Barkin misleading information, yet Barkin's  character allows herself to get lead by her. This allowing to get lead is  amazing considering that Peta Wilson's character is a suspect.  The  director also fosters the thought that all women have bisexual tendencies  that are unexplored.  I wonder if this would be played this way if the  leading character was a man.  I doubt it.  If he thought the detective had  bisexual tendencies he should have put more into the story line to suggest  this, rather than leap to generalities that half his audience might  sincerely disagree with.Julian Sands role as psychiatrist to some of the  women from this group, is shaky as best.  Involved with one patient and  somewhat shaky in his own right you are never quite sure why his character  was ever introduced, except to provide the dialogue from two of the women  in this movie.The major pull apparently intended for this movie is its  travel on the seamier side of same-sex orgy encounters and sadistic sex.  This is frequently brought up and quick spots are showed as a backdrop.  Few unfortunately have any more purpose than the photographs that are  displayed and seem to be the only reason this movie was made.If this was  vehicle to reintroduce Barkin back into movies and push Peta Wilson onto  the big screen it has done them both an injustice.  I expect more from the  two of them.  The director of this movie has let them down.",2,Very disappointing,964310400,"07 23, 2000",2000,2266,"['Generally', 'like', 'Ellen', 'Barkin', 'movie', 'why', 'opted', 'see', 'However', 'not', 'Ellen', 'Barkin', 'energy', 'are', 'used', 'seeing', 'movies', 'quot', 'Big', 'Easy', 'quot', 'quot', 'Sea', 'Love', 'quot', 'across', 'worn-out', 'detective', 'who', 'slogs', 'details', 'case', 'hopping', 'one', 'good', 'guess', 'are', 'never', 'impressed', 'thought', 'process', 'do', 'appreciate', 'character', 'Also', 'Jennifer', 'Anniston', 'long', 'shag', 'got', 'go.Peta', 'Wilson', 'major', 'part', 'story', 'potential', 'suspect/victim', 'however', 'role', 'spotty', 'inconsistent', 'best', 'Having', 'seen', 'quot', 'La', 'Femme', 'Nikita', 'quot', 'know', 'talents', 'are', 'much', 'greater.Neither', 'actress', 'given', 'enough', 'story', 'latch', 'onto', 'Peta', 'Wilson', 'character', 'repeatedly', 'detective', 'played', 'Barkin', 'misleading', 'information', 'Barkin', 'character', 'get', 'lead', 'allowing', 'get', 'lead', 'amazing', 'considering', 'Peta', 'Wilson', 'character', 'suspect', 'director', 'also', 'thought', 'women', 'have', 'bisexual', 'tendencies', 'are', 'unexplored', 'wonder', 'would', 'be', 'played', 'way', 'leading', 'character', 'was', 'man', 'doubt', 'thought', 'detective', 'had', 'bisexual', 'tendencies', 'should', 'have', 'put', 'more', 'story', 'line', 'suggest', 'rather', 'leap', 'generalities', 'audience', 'might', 'sincerely', 'disagree', 'with.Julian', 'Sands', 'role', 'psychiatrist', 'women', 'group', 'shaky', 'best', 'Involved', 'one', 'patient', 'somewhat', 'shaky', 'own', 'right', 'are', 'never', 'quite', 'sure', 'why', 'character', 'was', 'ever', 'introduced', 'provide', 'dialogue', 'two', 'women', 'movie.The', 'major', 'pull', 'apparently', 'intended', 'movie', 'travel', 'seamier', 'side', 'same-sex', 'orgy', 'encounters', 'sadistic', 'sex', 'frequently', 'brought', 'up', 'quick', 'spots', 'are', 'showed', 'backdrop', 'Few', 'unfortunately', 'have', 'more', 'purpose', 'photographs', 'are', 'displayed', 'seem', 'be', 'only', 'reason', 'movie', 'was', 'made.If', 'was', 'vehicle', 'reintroduce', 'Barkin', 'back', 'movies', 'push', 'Peta', 'Wilson', 'big', 'screen', 'done', 'injustice', 'expect', 'more', 'two', 'director', 'movie', 'let', 'down']",N/A
549702,A1NZRSRYA1WGPO,B00004STD9,Cayuga,"[2, 5]","This film is a cross between ""Basic Instinct"" and ""Dressed to Kill.""  But in a way, it is more misogynist than either of those two.  The fetishism of dead women's bodies in the film is truly repulsive.  The film shots of the murder victims after they are found are akin to snuff porn.  These photos are splashed in a big collage at the police station, and this collage frequently serves as backdrop to Ellen Barkin's soliloquies.  It is seemingly an attempt to deaden the viewer to any kind of empathy for the victims as human beings.Another misogynist aspect is the film's resolution.  I won't give away the ending, but the story line gives us a murderer based on a totally ludicrous theory about what motivates people.I am giving this film two stars instead of merely one, because of Peta Wilson's well-executed performance, and because the film includes a couple of hot, consensual, lesbian sex scenes.  A really hot one takes place in a department store dressing room.But I prefer movies that have hot sex with no fetishism of gynocide.

I came into it in the middle, and it looked so good, I stayed up to wait for another airing so I could watch it complete.  Let me tell you, it was worth it.  The thing that drew me to this movie was its seductiveness -- not just the sexuality -- the seductiveness of the suspense.  It's a taut thriller, with excellent camera work and direction.  The sensuality of the sexual seductions (mainly of women to women) -- though they show little or no actual sex -- is compelling, and well done.  Ellen Barkin plays a detective investigating these sexual murders.  She is drawn into this perverse and seductive world of rich housewives who are in a sort of sex club where they have affairs with other women.  There's a great deal of imagery involved, both real and surreal.  The murders themselves are nightmarish, and presented in dreamlike sequences.

549705,A3CWH6VKCTJAD,B00004STD9,"""flickjunkie""","[48, 48]","When it comes to sex, normative behavior depends on the circles in which one travels.  This film traverses a very sordid perimeter, and jolts us with images ranging from mild deviance to utter depravity.  The themes  include a women's club where affluent married women come to cheat on their  husbands with other women, as well as transvestitism, sadomasochism,  dominance and bondage, lesbian seduction and incest.  Oh, and lest I forget  the main storyline, we have serial killings where the mutilated female  victims are always found in the nude.Ellen Barkin plays a homicide  detective investigating the killings.  In the course of the investigation,  she becomes obsessed with Vicki, who is a suspect due to her connection  with two of the victims.  Vicki introduces her to a world where pain,  pleasure and sex collide.This is a bold venture into sex noir that is  sometimes provocative and at others disturbing, raw and distasteful.  The  plot was good and the ending original as mass murder stories go.  Unfortunately, the presentation was very disjointed and often hard to  follow.  That is probably because the investigation took a back seat to the  sexual odyssey, which meandered self-indulgently from hedonism to  perversion.  This film contained a good deal of nudity, some of which was  appropriate to the story and much of which was gratuitous.The direction  by Damian Harris was good with a lot of interesting perspective shots and  tight close-ups that enhanced both the suspense and the lustful aspects.  However, the cinematography lost a great deal because the color quality was  poor.Ellen Barkin was a good choice for the lead in this film.  Barkin  has a natural toughness combined with a scorching sexuality, which was the  precise combination her character needed.  Peta Wilson played the sexually  gifted Vicki and was seductive, sultry and lascivious.Overall, this was  a good, well-acted thriller with bizarre sexual preoccupations.  I rated it  7/10, but I can understand why so many people hated it.  It is definitely  not for everyone.  Many viewers will find the deviant sexual themes  repugnant and offensive.

Instead, as I was watching the movie, I couldn't help feeling annoyed at the fact that the director(Harris) was holding back on the terrific sexual tension between Peta(Vicki) and Ellen(Catherine) throughout the movie.  I can understand the tease but when Peta finally made her big move on Ellen....(PUSH!).  What's up with that?  We all know that if was Bruce, Brad, Harrison, or Tom(Cruise) in that situation, there would have been a love scene that would set the screen on fire.  It's not that I didn't respect Ellen's integrity but spontaneus hetero sexual encounters never affected male cop performances in the end.Dispite that complaint, the movie is very watchable if you are into pyscho thrillers.  Julian Sands is great as the kinky therapist who sometimes sleeps with his clients while wearing panty hose.  It was also nice to see Wendy Crewson let it loose for a change but I wish her role in the movie was more clearly defined. Luckily, if you are Ellen Birkin and Peta Wilson fans like I am, you'll probaly like this film more than most people.I have the DVD version of the movie and it comes with the full screen American version(same as the VHS version) and the letterboxed unrated european version on the flip side.  There isn't much difference between the two versions except that the european version has more flashback sequences involving Catherine and her ex-husband and his girlfriend.",3,Almost a Great Movie,976838400,"12 15, 2000",2000,1550,"['excellent', 'female', 'cast', 'movie', 'Mercy', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'quot', 'must', 'see', 'quot', 'sexual', 'thriller', 'female', 'desire', 'perversion', 'Instead', 'was', 'watching', 'movie', 'could', ""n't"", 'help', 'feeling', 'annoyed', 'fact', 'director', 'Harris', 'was', 'holding', 'back', 'terrific', 'sexual', 'tension', 'Peta', 'Vicki', 'Ellen', 'Catherine', 'movie', 'can', 'understand', 'tease', 'when', 'Peta', 'finally', 'made', 'big', 'move', 'Ellen', 'PUSH', 'What', 'up', 'know', 'was', 'Bruce', 'Brad', 'Harrison', 'Tom', 'Cruise', 'situation', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'love', 'scene', 'would', 'set', 'screen', 'fire', 'not', 'did', ""n't"", 'respect', 'Ellen', 'integrity', 'spontaneus', 'hetero', 'sexual', 'encounters', 'never', 'affected', 'male', 'cop', 'performances', 'end.Dispite', 'complaint', 'movie', 'very', 'watchable', 'are', 'pyscho', 'thrillers', 'Julian', 'Sands', 'great', 'kinky', 'therapist', 'who', 'sleeps', 'clients', 'wearing', 'panty', 'hose', 'was', 'also', 'nice', 'see', 'Wendy', 'Crewson', 'let', 'loose', 'change', 'wish', 'role', 'movie', 'was', 'more', 'clearly', 'defined', 'Luckily', 'are', 'Ellen', 'Birkin', 'Peta', 'Wilson', 'fans', 'am', ""'ll"", 'probaly', 'film', 'more', 'most', 'people.I', 'have', 'DVD', 'version', 'movie', 'full', 'screen', 'American', 'version', 'same', 'VHS', 'version', 'letterboxed', 'unrated', 'european', 'version', 'flip', 'side', ""n't"", 'much', 'difference', 'two', 'versions', 'european', 'version', 'more', 'flashback', 'sequences', 'involving', 'Catherine', 'ex-husband', 'girlfriend']",N/A

So as far as erotic/thriller genre is concerned this is somehow a new twist.On the down side, it is very badly filmed and scripted, a poor imitation of Dressed to Kill without the Hitchcockian atmosphere or De Palma's able direction. And it has also poor Julian Sands with yet another bad role, as bad in fact as his role in Boxing Helena, and this is no easy feat to manage, but he did!So you can watch/buy this movie for Peta 'lezzing' it up, not a bad thing in itself,yet you can also be excused for using the word 'Mercy' only to be spared such mediocrity in the future..You decide!",3,You Decide!,1064880000,"09 30, 2003",2003,823,"['really', 'can', 'not', 'make', 'up', 'mind', 'properly', 'Mercy', 'did', 'offer', 'slight', 'dilemma', 'reviewing', 'plus', 'side', 'Peta', 'Wilson', 'playing', 'lesbian', 'who', 'SM', 'who', 'erotically', 'charged', 'scene', 'Ellen', 'Barkin', 'So', 'as', 'far', 'erotic/thriller', 'genre', 'concerned', 'somehow', 'new', 'twist.On', 'down', 'side', 'very', 'badly', 'filmed', 'scripted', 'poor', 'imitation', 'Dressed', 'Kill', 'Hitchcockian', 'atmosphere', 'De', 'Palma', 'able', 'direction', 'also', 'poor', 'Julian', 'Sands', 'yet', 'bad', 'role', 'bad', 'fact', 'role', 'Boxing', 'Helena', 'easy', 'feat', 'manage', 'did', 'can', 'watch/buy', 'movie', 'Peta', ""'lezzing"", 'up', 'not', 'bad', 'thing', 'yet', 'can', 'also', 'be', 'excused', 'using', 'word', 'only', 'be', 'spared', 'such', 'mediocrity', 'future..You', 'decide']",N/A

549713,A2X25C107CSLOR,B00004STD9,"Peter Shelley ""petershelley""","[7, 11]","In her previous roles Ellen Barkin has been the kind of actress willing to take risks. She was a repellent face-slasher in Johnny Handsome, she cross-dressed in Switch, or rather played a man reborn as a woman, even if it was within the context of a comedy, and in Bad Company she dabbled with miscegenation, having an affair with Laurence Fishburne. It is said that she turned down the Sharon Stone part in Basic Instinct, which may be evidence of her reluctance to explore lesbianism, and which also may explain her performance here. Even accepting that she is playing a homicide detective and a widow, her humourless restraint is baffling. She is amusing cursing when angry, but she is lit so unflatteringly that it's amazing that Peta Wilson as a suspect in serial murders would be interested in her. Director Damian Harris adapted the novel by David L Lindsey, and as apparently another version of the film includes flashback scenes between Barkin's dead husband and the woman he had an affair with, whom we see Barkin glare at, perhaps it is these scenes that give a clue to her behaviour. Wilson is presented as a lesbian predator by Harris in a way that doesn't pander to the exploitive porn genre, and has a scene where she picks up a stranger the way a heterosexual man would, which is a refreshing demonstration of sexual fair play. However when she attempts to seduce Barkin and is rebuffed, we are as perplexed as Wilson, primarily because Harris has set the tone with an expectation that Barkin has latent homosexual impulses, a theme given less weight than the tracking of the serial killer. (Note: I am not the type who pants for lesbian love scenes). Barkin actually responds most passionately to a dog that attacks her. So in spite of Harris' skill for pacing and glossy interiors, the killer plot is unsatisfyingly treated with bits thrown in from 8MM, and an inexplicable ambiguous conclusion. Julian Sands as a psychiatrist who has some connection with the victims and some professionally unwise private activities, points out the little known phenomena of male victims of female sexual abusers, and although the serial killings are all women, this is either a huge McGuffin, or the dubious alliance of sexually abused females and adult lesbian behaviour. This theory has some partial contextual legitimacy by having the lesbians we see interested in sadomasochistic play, much like the sm behaviour of male homosexuals in Cruising was prefaced as being marginal. The idea that the male abuser destroys the nurturing relationship between mother and daughter, that the child then seeks the return of that mother love in other forms and inherently rejects any other male attention, denies the pathology of women who continue in heterosexual abusive relationships. There is also a suggestion that the mothers of these victims were aware of and indifferent to the abuse -  that the girls had been abandoned - which is an enormous generalisation, but echoed in Barkin's meeting of Wilson's family. Harris gives Barkin an inde styled dream of the murdered women seen naked, and other women progressively unclothed, the way Diane Arbus would have shown us if she had used colour, which is at odds at the way he otherwise fetishises the women as amazons. This may be indicative of Barkin's homophobia, but it reads more as a mistake, after the serial killer takes the trouble to wash the hair and apply doll-like makeup to the victims.",3,is it Lindsey or Harris?,992131200,"06 10, 2001",2001,3448,"['previous', 'roles', 'Ellen', 'Barkin', 'been', 'kind', 'actress', 'willing', 'take', 'risks', 'was', 'repellent', 'face-slasher', 'Johnny', 'Handsome', 'cross-dressed', 'Switch', 'rather', 'played', 'man', 'reborn', 'woman', 'even', 'was', 'context', 'comedy', 'Bad', 'Company', 'dabbled', 'miscegenation', 'having', 'affair', 'Laurence', 'Fishburne', 'said', 'turned', 'down', 'Sharon', 'Stone', 'part', 'Basic', 'Instinct', 'may', 'be', 'evidence', 'reluctance', 'explore', 'lesbianism', 'also', 'may', 'explain', 'performance', 'here', 'Even', 'accepting', 'playing', 'homicide', 'detective', 'widow', 'humourless', 'restraint', 'baffling', 'amusing', 'cursing', 'when', 'angry', 'lit', 'so', 'unflatteringly', 'amazing', 'Peta', 'Wilson', 'suspect', 'serial', 'murders', 'would', 'be', 'interested', 'Director', 'Damian', 'Harris', 'adapted', 'novel', 'David', 'L', 'Lindsey', 'as', 'apparently', 'version', 'film', 'flashback', 'scenes', 'Barkin', 'dead', 'husband', 'woman', 'had', 'affair', 'whom', 'see', 'Barkin', 'glare', 'perhaps', 'scenes', 'give', 'clue', 'behaviour', 'Wilson', 'presented', 'lesbian', 'predator', 'Harris', 'way', ""n't"", 'pander', 'exploitive', 'porn', 'genre', 'scene', 'where', 'up', 'stranger', 'way', 'heterosexual', 'man', 'would', 'refreshing', 'demonstration', 'sexual', 'fair', 'play', 'However', 'when', 'seduce', 'Barkin', 'rebuffed', 'are', 'as', 'perplexed', 'Wilson', 'primarily', 'Harris', 'set', 'tone', 'expectation', 'Barkin', 'latent', 'homosexual', 'impulses', 'theme', 'given', 'less', 'weight', 'tracking', 'serial', 'killer', 'Note', 'am', 'not', 'type', 'who', 'lesbian', 'love', 'scenes', 'Barkin', 'actually', 'most', 'passionately', 'dog', 'So', 'spite', 'Harris', 'skill', 'pacing', 'glossy', 'interiors', 'killer', 'plot', 'unsatisfyingly', 'treated', 'bits', 'thrown', '8MM', 'inexplicable', 'ambiguous', 'conclusion', 'Julian', 'Sands', 'psychiatrist', 'who', 'connection', 'victims', 'professionally', 'unwise', 'private', 'activities', 'points', 'out', 'little', 'known', 'phenomena', 'male', 'victims', 'female', 'sexual', 'abusers', 'serial', 'killings', 'are', 'women', 'huge', 'McGuffin', 'dubious', 'alliance', 'sexually', 'abused', 'females', 'adult', 'lesbian', 'behaviour', 'theory', 'partial', 'contextual', 'legitimacy', 'having', 'lesbians', 'see', 'interested', 'sadomasochistic', 'play', 'much', 'sm', 'behaviour', 'male', 'homosexuals', 'Cruising', 'was', 'prefaced', 'being', 'marginal', 'idea', 'male', 'abuser', 'nurturing', 'relationship', 'mother', 'daughter', 'child', 'then', 'return', 'mother', 'love', 'other', 'forms', 'inherently', 'other', 'male', 'attention', 'pathology', 'women', 'who', 'continue', 'heterosexual', 'abusive', 'relationships', 'also', 'suggestion', 'mothers', 'victims', 'were', 'aware', 'indifferent', 'abuse', 'girls', 'had', 'been', 'abandoned', 'enormous', 'generalisation', 'echoed', 'Barkin', 'meeting', 'Wilson', 'family', 'Harris', 'Barkin', 'inde', 'styled', 'dream', 'murdered', 'women', 'seen', 'naked', 'other', 'women', 'progressively', 'unclothed', 'way', 'Diane', 'Arbus', 'would', 'have', 'shown', 'had', 'used', 'colour', 'odds', 'way', 'otherwise', 'women', 'amazons', 'may', 'be', 'indicative', 'Barkin', 'homophobia', 'more', 'mistake', 'serial', 'killer', 'trouble', 'wash', 'hair', 'apply', 'doll-like', 'makeup', 'victims']",N/A
