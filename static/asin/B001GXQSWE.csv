(Most notably Emma Thompson and Michael Gambon as Lady Marchmain and Lord Marchmain respectively.)  Not having a rote memory of reading the novel twenty-five years ago, I find this adaptation true to the spirit of Evelyn Waugh's intentions.  Wonderfully shot and in crisp detail, this beautiful film has nary a wasted scene.  (Particularly, they prudently excise the infamous part where Charles listens to a scholar spout off during a meal.  The dialogue they do retain serves the clarity of the heart of the novel.)

I have also never read the book by Evelyn Waugh.  I was thus less than enthusiastic in going to see this film.  Regardless, to my great surprise, I found the film to be totally enthralling.Charles Ryder (Matthew Goode) travels from London to Oxford where is enrolled to study history.  He immediately comes within the orbit of Sebastian Flight (Ben Whishaw), a very gay dilettante.  Although Ryder gives no real clue to being gay, he enjoys the company of Flight.  They become close friends.  As part of this process, Ryder goes with Flight to the vast family estate, Brideshead, where he meets the very Catholic Flight family.  Ryder is an atheist but comes to be more intrigued than repelled by the obsessive faith of the Flights.  I might add that I could empathise with Ryder to some degree as I am an atheist too and have married into a family of Catholic fellow travellers that includes a priest!As time passes, Ryder becomes entranced by Sebastian's sister, Julia.  However, she carries religious baggage that prevents her from becoming involved with Ryder.  They meet I later life but, again, faith intervenes to hinder matters.  Faith can be a hard master.This is a wonderful film.  The acting is beautiful with all the main characters being thoroughly plausible as members of that condescending English ruling class.  The settings too are marvellous as we are drawn across London, Oxford, Venice and Morocco.  I can thus recommend this film unconditionally.",5,Entrancing,1224979200,"10 26, 2008",2008,1601,"['vaguely', 'recall', 'seeing', 'snippets', 'television', 'series', 'Brideshead', 'Revisited', 'number', 'years', 'ago', 'never', 'really', 'liked', 'have', 'also', 'never', 'read', 'book', 'Evelyn', 'Waugh', 'was', 'thus', 'less', 'enthusiastic', 'going', 'see', 'film', 'Regardless', 'great', 'surprise', 'found', 'film', 'be', 'totally', 'enthralling.Charles', 'Ryder', 'Matthew', 'Goode', 'London', 'Oxford', 'where', 'enrolled', 'study', 'history', 'immediately', 'orbit', 'Sebastian', 'Flight', 'Ben', 'Whishaw', 'very', 'gay', 'dilettante', 'Ryder', 'real', 'clue', 'being', 'gay', 'company', 'Flight', 'become', 'close', 'friends', 'part', 'process', 'Ryder', 'Flight', 'vast', 'family', 'estate', 'Brideshead', 'where', 'very', 'Catholic', 'Flight', 'family', 'Ryder', 'atheist', 'be', 'more', 'intrigued', 'repelled', 'obsessive', 'faith', 'Flights', 'might', 'add', 'could', 'empathise', 'Ryder', 'degree', 'am', 'atheist', 'too', 'have', 'married', 'family', 'Catholic', 'fellow', 'travellers', 'priest', 'time', 'passes', 'Ryder', 'entranced', 'Sebastian', 'sister', 'Julia', 'However', 'religious', 'baggage', 'becoming', 'involved', 'Ryder', 'meet', 'later', 'life', 'again', 'faith', 'intervenes', 'hinder', 'matters', 'Faith', 'can', 'be', 'hard', 'master.This', 'wonderful', 'film', 'acting', 'beautiful', 'main', 'characters', 'being', 'thoroughly', 'plausible', 'members', 'condescending', 'English', 'ruling', 'class', 'settings', 'too', 'are', 'marvellous', 'are', 'drawn', 'London', 'Oxford', 'Venice', 'Morocco', 'can', 'thus', 'recommend', 'film', 'unconditionally']",Brideshead Revisited

Gone is the wonderful narration by Charles and all the beautiful character development.  There is a nice carnival scene--it has nothing to do with the book or anything, but I guess once you've removed so much you have to put something back in.Even if one has never read the book or seen the original, I can't really see this being a good movie.  It's so random, and has been converted into a weird, improbable love triangle with unconnected little snippets trying to masquerade as the original work, which considering how thoroughly this adaption has deviated from anything to do with the book, are unnecessary and confusing.

1198814,A3TOWO3PUY3DGL,B001GXQSWE,-Ashi-,"[4, 7]","This is a very controversial movie, it seems.  People either love it or hate it....  Having never read the book, but watched briefly of the 80's series (and quit rather early on), I believe this movie can get a better reception should it be redirected, reinterpreted and then revisited one more time.It's an exuberantly shot movie, in the vein of The Talented Mr. Ripley.  The story is only so so (and I'm being polite).  I remember when I watched it in the theatre, I wanted to leave several times, but at the same time, hoping the story would get more interesting.  Every actor/actress in the movie did a very admirable job.  Director did a good job also.  However, the story couldn't keep it up.  The ending is disappointing and abruptly wrapped up it feels.  I don't know if that's the way Evelyn Waugh wrote it, but as a movie, the dramatic structure need to be redrawn.I think I'm going to be scolded for this, but I would like to draw a parallel with Francis O'Conner's version of Mansfield Park (don't remember who the director was...).  That version was often browbeaten by  Austen fans for not being faithful adaptation of Austen's work.  Fair enough, but as an individual work, it's enjoyable with its fresh new take.I honestly believe this movie can do the same, except if the dramatic structure was more... capable of keeping audience's interest.  Instead, it feels like it totally relies on the subject matter to lure the audience into the theatre, and then disappoints....  If I were the producer, I would go back to drawing board and discuss with everyone:  Who is our target audience?  What's the message we are trying to send?  Where is the climax!?!This movie made me so angry because it has such a potential but it fails to deliver.  Three stars for production value and everyone's hard work.

1198815,AXSH6O4OP5L4M,B001GXQSWE,"Atheen M. Wilson ""Atheen""","[1, 3]","This was a magnificent film from the point of view of cinematography.  Each episode was beautifully filmed.  Some scenes seemed a little too dark, but generally speaking the darkness helped create a sense of drama and tragedy.Some of the characters seemed almost numb; in places this greatly increased audience awareness of the stultifying nature of the lives of these people and their reality, while with some characters it seemed as though blank expressions were to be taken as ""acting,"" this was especially so of Julia and Charles.With the character of Sebastian, played by Ben Whishaw, however, the presence was more controlled than wooden.  He was the epitome of urbanity, his casual and offhand manner obviously a mask for deeper feelings.  With the removal of the mask, the deeper feelings, especially of despair, seemed almost as naked as his appearance in the buff by the fountain or in the bathroom.  This created an overall sense of someone so completely on the edge, a suicide seemed eminent.  Although it did not occur in the traditional form of bullet to the head or hanging from the rafters, it might be seen as a slow and intentional suicide by alcohol.  Certainly this had the greatest effect on his family, especially his mother, which is probably as he intended it, since it gave him some degree of control. As his mother explained to Charles Ryder, Charles drank to get drunk, Sebastian drank to destroy himself.  Though she misconstrued his reasons, Charles pointed them out: Sebastian drank to free himself of her.  This did not endear Charles to her.Emma Thompson's portrayal of Lady Marchmain was also expertly controlled.  She seemed a mass of conflicting motives; a mother desiring the love of her children, one who sought to keep them safe both in the here and the hereafter by controlling their every thought and action and thereby driving them to despair and withdrawal.  She was open-minded about Ryder's class, as many at the time might not have been, but she was unremitting on the issue of his atheism.  She was charming, attractive and generous but also arrogant, vindictive, and selfish.  One easily saw how she drew others in while exacting a steep price for having done so.  One never knew whether to see her as Machiavellian and sinister or hopelessly and helplessly caught up in the web of her class and religion.The character of Charles Ryder, played by Matthew Goode, seems hardly more than a backdrop to the angst of the other characters, though at times I wondered if he weren't intended to be the ""devil"" in disquise, tempting the faithful from their  miserable path to redemption.  It was his woodenness that most intrigued me, since he had less oppressive circumstances and therefore less reason to feel wooden.  His relationship with his father, played by Patrick Malahide, seemed a little distant but hardly damaging; his talent was recognized in time, his life was essentially his own.  Yet he allows himself to be pulled back into the dysfunctional lives of the Flyte family despite having been burned more than once by their self immolating behaviors.  Somehow a house no more comfortable than a museum, no matter how opulent, seems inadequate reason for his involvement with people who are definitely damaged goods, especially since any attempt he made to help them only made them worse.  As Sebastian told him on his first visit, if all he wanted was to see all the sights at Brideshead, he'd have been better off buying a ticket and taking a tour.  Nothing truer was said. One could almost see a good term paper in the interpretation of the meaning of the house in Brideshead Revisited!A very intriguing story, well filmed, and well acted.",5,"A very intriguing story, well filmed, and well acted",1296086400,"01 27, 2011",2011,3693,"['was', 'magnificent', 'film', 'point', 'view', 'cinematography', 'episode', 'was', 'beautifully', 'filmed', 'scenes', 'seemed', 'little', 'too', 'dark', 'generally', 'speaking', 'darkness', 'helped', 'create', 'sense', 'drama', 'tragedy.Some', 'characters', 'seemed', 'almost', 'numb', 'places', 'greatly', 'increased', 'audience', 'awareness', 'stultifying', 'nature', 'lives', 'people', 'reality', 'characters', 'seemed', 'blank', 'expressions', 'were', 'be', 'taken', 'acting', 'was', 'especially', 'so', 'Julia', 'Charles.With', 'character', 'Sebastian', 'played', 'Ben', 'Whishaw', 'however', 'presence', 'was', 'more', 'controlled', 'wooden', 'was', 'epitome', 'urbanity', 'casual', 'offhand', 'manner', 'obviously', 'mask', 'deeper', 'feelings', 'removal', 'mask', 'deeper', 'feelings', 'especially', 'despair', 'seemed', 'almost', 'as', 'naked', 'appearance', 'buff', 'fountain', 'bathroom', 'created', 'overall', 'sense', 'someone', 'so', 'completely', 'edge', 'suicide', 'seemed', 'eminent', 'did', 'not', 'occur', 'traditional', 'form', 'bullet', 'head', 'hanging', 'rafters', 'might', 'be', 'seen', 'slow', 'intentional', 'suicide', 'alcohol', 'Certainly', 'had', 'greatest', 'effect', 'family', 'especially', 'mother', 'probably', 'intended', 'gave', 'degree', 'control', 'mother', 'explained', 'Charles', 'Ryder', 'Charles', 'get', 'drunk', 'Sebastian', 'drank', 'destroy', 'misconstrued', 'reasons', 'Charles', 'pointed', 'out', 'Sebastian', 'drank', 'free', 'did', 'not', 'endear', 'Charles', 'her.Emma', 'Thompson', 'portrayal', 'Lady', 'Marchmain', 'was', 'also', 'expertly', 'controlled', 'seemed', 'mass', 'conflicting', 'motives', 'mother', 'desiring', 'love', 'children', 'one', 'who', 'sought', 'keep', 'safe', 'here', 'hereafter', 'controlling', 'thought', 'action', 'thereby', 'driving', 'despair', 'withdrawal', 'was', 'open-minded', 'Ryder', 'class', 'many', 'time', 'might', 'not', 'have', 'been', 'was', 'unremitting', 'issue', 'atheism', 'was', 'charming', 'attractive', 'generous', 'also', 'arrogant', 'vindictive', 'selfish', 'One', 'easily', 'saw', 'how', 'drew', 'others', 'exacting', 'steep', 'price', 'having', 'done', 'so', 'One', 'never', 'knew', 'see', 'Machiavellian', 'sinister', 'hopelessly', 'helplessly', 'caught', 'up', 'web', 'class', 'religion.The', 'character', 'Charles', 'Ryder', 'played', 'Matthew', 'Goode', 'hardly', 'more', 'backdrop', 'angst', 'other', 'characters', 'though', 'times', 'wondered', 'were', ""n't"", 'intended', 'be', 'devil', 'disquise', 'tempting', 'faithful', 'miserable', 'path', 'redemption', 'was', 'woodenness', 'most', 'intrigued', 'had', 'less', 'oppressive', 'circumstances', 'therefore', 'less', 'reason', 'feel', 'wooden', 'relationship', 'father', 'played', 'Patrick', 'Malahide', 'seemed', 'little', 'distant', 'hardly', 'damaging', 'talent', 'was', 'recognized', 'time', 'life', 'was', 'essentially', 'own', 'be', 'pulled', 'back', 'dysfunctional', 'lives', 'Flyte', 'family', 'having', 'been', 'burned', 'more', 'once', 'self', 'immolating', 'behaviors', 'Somehow', 'house', 'more', 'comfortable', 'museum', 'matter', 'how', 'opulent', 'inadequate', 'reason', 'involvement', 'people', 'who', 'are', 'definitely', 'damaged', 'goods', 'especially', 'attempt', 'made', 'help', 'only', 'made', 'worse', 'Sebastian', 'told', 'first', 'visit', 'wanted', 'was', 'see', 'sights', 'Brideshead', ""'d"", 'have', 'been', 'better', 'off', 'buying', 'ticket', 'taking', 'tour', 'Nothing', 'truer', 'was', 'said', 'One', 'could', 'almost', 'see', 'good', 'term', 'paper', 'interpretation', 'meaning', 'house', 'Brideshead', 'Revisited', 'very', 'intriguing', 'story', 'well', 'filmed', 'well', 'acted']",Brideshead Revisited
1198816,A1URPQ4S8TJCR4,B001GXQSWE,Bert vanC Bailey,"[2, 3]","The miniseries based on Waugh's novel was beyond question well ahead of its time for 1981 TV: it was widely regarded as a dazzling, near-poetic transfer to the medium of television, and raised the bar for miniseries generally. For all that, its long succession of entrancing episodes sometimes seemed to drag, echoing for me many of the college papers I was then having to correct: mostly padded to make up for not that much in the actual script. Episode after episode seemed filled with a lot of swanning around, with a plotline visually transfixed on the handsome leads, and, of course, on Castle Howard and its dreamy grounds -- embellished even further by Geoffrey Burgon's lush score.This was due in large part to a subject that was regarded as risqu&eacute;, even then. Still, the proceedings were directed so obliquely by Charles Sturridge as to give anyone like me, who hadn't yet read the book, precious little to go on beyond Charles Ryder's adoration of the indolent Lord Sebastian and his delightful trappings.This more recent realization of Waugh's novel, by contrast, is in several ways more satisfying. It has the considerable advantage of a more straightforward plot, mostly as a result of overtness regarding the relations between the central characters, and the love triangle that follows. The compressed story suits a movie's shorter length but, on the negative side, Waugh's novel is long and of near-Jamesian subtlety -- or fussiness, some might say -- and much is lost in the simplification. The more the plot is recast, the less the scripted characters resemble the novel's originals. This makes for a very different artefact, and reviews are left either to choose to rail against the infidelity to the literature or to focus instead on the movie's merits.The chance to be straightforward in the more recent production diminishes the attention to the leads' gay attraction, so the camera spends far less time gloating on them than in the miniseries. This has certain advantages - especially if, like me, you consider that acting never was Jeremy Irons' strong suit (rather, his real talents lie in his vocal skills, which place him in the same class as Burton and John Gielgud). On the negative side, the characters' changes are not just to the branches of Waugh's novel but perhaps to its very roots. Hence the disapproval of so many reviews by lovers of the book.Speaking of Gielgud, his part in the '81 production was one of its high points -- and, like cute children and Denholm Elliott, he always was an impossible act to follow. But his counterpart in this movie, Michael Gambon, replaces Sir John's absent-minded indifference with something closer to aristocratic disdain, and his part stays very much afloat where most others' would sink in the comparison. Emma Thompson is also in this, and both supporting performances are masterful.So .do. expect more straightforward story-telling, a less leisurely, eye-candy experience, and lead parts that are less belaboured (but which alter the originals). The miniseries' outstanding art direction, costumes, etc., are closely matched, and, while the direction serves different aims, it is arguably as good. The more recent production also obtained the rights to use glorious Castle Howard again: a wise move.

Mom""","[5, 7]","... to have the luminous memories of the earlier mini-series to compare to it, especially when the series - lavish and leisurely - set the dramatic standard for a large or small-screen rendering of a literary classic. Just as the 2008 move version of ""Pride and Prejudice"" had the misfortune to be compared to the Jennifer Ehle-Colin Firth retelling (which many Jane Austin fans regard as the definitive `Pride and Prejudice') so must this version stand up against the previous `Brideshead'. Which it does manage, after a fashion and to be to be strictly fair; the pace of a two-movie must be pretty brisk, after a leisurely, ten-hour plus exploration of several different love affairs - the first of those affairs being the attraction of a young Charles Ryder (Mathew Goode)  for the Marchmain family and their splendid house, Brideshead.  Then there is the hopeless affection of the youngest son of the house, Sebastian Flyte (Ben Wishaw) for Charles, Charles' love for Sebastian's sister Julia (Hayley Atwell), and the fierce devotion of their mother, Lady Marchmain (Emma Thompson) for the Catholic faith. Finally, there might also be the cool-eyed pursuit of power and position by Julia's husband, Rex Mottram (Jonathan Cake). Greta Sacci, Michael Gambon, Patrick Malahide and Anna Madeley round out the cast, with Castle Howard in Yorkshire again playing the part of Brideshead, the stately home. All of these various meditations on love and the varieties thereof, wealth, power and religion are melded fairly efficiently into a narrative which hits all the high-points, more or less in order. With the cast featuring the hi-end acting talent that it does, this version can't possibly be considered a waste of watching time - not least of it being that Goode and Wishaw appear much more age-appropriate in the earlier scenes, when they are supposed to be college student.Of the extras on this DVD, the most memorable is ""The World of Brideshead"", a look at the filming in various locations, and a collection of omitted scenes, most of which I wish had been added to the DVD release.",3,Unlucky the Movie...,1237593600,"03 21, 2009",2009,2088,"['have', 'luminous', 'memories', 'earlier', 'mini-series', 'compare', 'especially', 'when', 'series', 'lavish', 'leisurely', 'set', 'dramatic', 'standard', 'large', 'small-screen', 'rendering', 'literary', 'classic', 'Just', '2008', 'move', 'version', 'Pride', 'Prejudice', 'had', 'misfortune', 'be', 'compared', 'Jennifer', 'Ehle-Colin', 'Firth', 'retelling', 'many', 'Jane', 'Austin', 'fans', 'regard', 'definitive', 'Pride', 'Prejudice', 'so', 'must', 'version', 'stand', 'up', 'previous', 'Brideshead', 'manage', 'fashion', 'be', 'be', 'strictly', 'fair', 'pace', 'two-movie', 'must', 'be', 'pretty', 'brisk', 'leisurely', 'ten-hour', 'exploration', 'several', 'different', 'love', 'affairs', 'first', 'affairs', 'being', 'attraction', 'young', 'Charles', 'Ryder', 'Mathew', 'Goode', 'Marchmain', 'family', 'splendid', 'house', 'Brideshead', 'Then', 'hopeless', 'affection', 'youngest', 'son', 'house', 'Sebastian', 'Flyte', 'Ben', 'Wishaw', 'Charles', 'Charles', 'love', 'Sebastian', 'sister', 'Julia', 'Hayley', 'Atwell', 'fierce', 'devotion', 'mother', 'Lady', 'Marchmain', 'Emma', 'Thompson', 'Catholic', 'faith', 'Finally', 'might', 'also', 'be', 'cool-eyed', 'pursuit', 'power', 'position', 'Julia', 'husband', 'Rex', 'Mottram', 'Jonathan', 'Cake', 'Greta', 'Sacci', 'Michael', 'Gambon', 'Patrick', 'Malahide', 'Anna', 'Madeley', 'round', 'out', 'cast', 'Castle', 'Howard', 'Yorkshire', 'again', 'playing', 'part', 'Brideshead', 'stately', 'home', 'various', 'meditations', 'love', 'varieties', 'thereof', 'wealth', 'power', 'religion', 'are', 'melded', 'fairly', 'efficiently', 'narrative', 'high-points', 'more', 'less', 'order', 'cast', 'featuring', 'hi-end', 'acting', 'talent', 'version', 'ca', ""n't"", 'possibly', 'be', 'considered', 'waste', 'watching', 'time', 'not', 'least', 'being', 'Goode', 'Wishaw', 'appear', 'much', 'more', 'age-appropriate', 'earlier', 'scenes', 'when', 'are', 'supposed', 'be', 'college', 'extras', 'DVD', 'most', 'memorable', 'World', 'Brideshead', 'look', 'filming', 'various', 'locations', 'collection', 'omitted', 'scenes', 'most', 'wish', 'had', 'been', 'added', 'DVD', 'release']",Brideshead Revisited

I hear so many people making comparisons between this ""edition"" of Brideshead Revisited and the early-eighties Masterpiece Theater/Jeremy Irons/Anthony Andrews/John Mortimer outing that I pity the cast and makers of this earnest twenty-first century take on Evelyn Waugh's circumspect morality play. Having never read the source novel or viewed any visit to Brideshead but this one, I am at best a neutral observer, at worst an unenlightened naf who witnesses the dawn and thinks she has seen the day itself, but that being as it may, I found this tale both too understated and too restrained to merit the label ""classic."" The performances were extraordinarily good here, no exceptions, and the settings were lovely as befit the high emotions the story attempts to convey, but whether the fault lay in too ambitious a condensation of source material or simply a failure to translate to the sensibilities of this century, Julian Jarrold's film fails to captivate. It's lovely, it's unique, it aims very high indeed, but in the end the 2008 Brideshead Revisited seems tame and polite when in my feeling it should have moved a viewer with its tragic sense of what lay behind all that British restraint.",4,"Some Seem Too Ready To Dub This ""Brideshead Revisited Revisited"" Don't They?",1241913600,"05 10, 2009",2009,1531,"['When', 'novel', 'as', 'popular', 'been', 'fifty', 'years', 'more', 'committed', 'film', 'not', 'once', 'twice', 'space', 'generation', 'often', 'case', 'comparisons', 'first', 'filmed', 'version', 'will', 'weigh', 'second', 'project', 'point', 'shred', 'singular', 'identity', 'drowns', 'first', 'project', 'wake', 'hear', 'so', 'many', 'people', 'making', 'comparisons', 'edition', 'Brideshead', 'Revisited', 'early-eighties', 'Masterpiece', 'Theater/Jeremy', 'Irons/Anthony', 'Andrews/John', 'Mortimer', 'outing', 'pity', 'cast', 'makers', 'earnest', 'twenty-first', 'century', 'take', 'Evelyn', 'Waugh', 'circumspect', 'morality', 'play', 'Having', 'never', 'read', 'source', 'novel', 'viewed', 'visit', 'Brideshead', 'one', 'am', 'best', 'neutral', 'observer', 'unenlightened', 'naf', 'who', 'dawn', 'seen', 'day', 'being', 'may', 'found', 'tale', 'too', 'understated', 'too', 'restrained', 'merit', 'label', 'classic', 'performances', 'were', 'extraordinarily', 'good', 'here', 'exceptions', 'settings', 'were', 'lovely', 'befit', 'high', 'emotions', 'story', 'attempts', 'convey', 'fault', 'lay', 'too', 'ambitious', 'condensation', 'source', 'material', 'simply', 'failure', 'translate', 'sensibilities', 'century', 'Julian', 'Jarrold', 'film', 'captivate', 'lovely', 'unique', 'very', 'high', 'indeed', 'end', '2008', 'Brideshead', 'Revisited', 'tame', 'polite', 'when', 'feeling', 'should', 'have', 'moved', 'viewer', 'tragic', 'sense', 'what', 'lay', 'behind', 'British', 'restraint']",Brideshead Revisited

1198821,A2FRKEXDXDN1KI,B001GXQSWE,Dennis A. Amith (kndy),"[12, 19]","The film is quite epic as it's filmed in the UK, Venice and Morocco and there are so many beautiful locations indoor and outdoor, ""Brideshead Revisited"" is rather ambitious.  Each person is cast pretty well with Matthew Goode, having to use less dialogue and reading his emotions through his facial expressions.  Emma Thompson, Ben Whishaw and Hayley Atwell did a remarkable job with their role and overall, the film was a good story about family and the pressures of that time of socioeconomic times when people were judged by the places they lived, the clothes they wear and where religion was strictly enforced and sinful ways were intolerable.  But to see how a family would change once Charles enters their life.  Is he their poison or is he giving them a chance to live free?VIDEO & AUDIO:The film is featured in widescreen (2:40:1) and there are just many beautiful shots in this film.  The crew went all out in shooting scenes in London at the beautiful Castle Howard which filled in quite nicely for Brideshead and also capturing the beautiful landscape of Venice, Italy and then in Morocco.As for the audio, the audio is presented in Dolby Digital 5.1 Surround Sound.  There are quite a few scenes from the film that utilized the rear audio channels nicely.  For example, at Morocco, you can hear the people all around you and in some scenes that featured a car zooming.  But overall, this film is primarily dialogue-driven.SPECIAL FEATURES:The DVD includes a few bonus features such as:* Deleted Scenes with optional Commentary - A few scenes that had some parts cut out of the film and the director talks about why they were cut out of the film.* Filmmakers Audio Commentary -  Julian Jarrold and others talk about the actual filming and behind-the-scene facts.  Also, reasons why they changed certain scenes from the way it was featured in the novel and the way it was featured on the film.* ""The World of Brideshead"" Featurette - This is a 23-minute featurette featuring interviews with the cast and behind-the-scenes footage of the making of the film, the challenges of shooting at various locations and much more.I have never read the novel or seen the drama series before but I do know it's impact and how the book is acknowledged as one of the top 100 written novels of all time by Time Magazine.  I can only think that what the writers and director were able to craft from a long novel for International audiences truly worked.Watching the film unfold from beginning to end, I can see the complications of Catholicism forced upon the parents to their children and how these children have taken a brunt of the religion and have grown to really not get along with their mother.  But from my research of the book and this film, I can understand those who are supportive and those who are vehemently against the film because of it's changes. Primarily between Charles and Sebastian.  In the book, the two are really close friends.  If they were having any romance, it was ambiguous.  If anything, the relationship was platonic.  In the film, they are lovers.As much as the film sounds like it's bashing the Catholic religion, the truth is that its not.  The book features the major characters who were affected by the Catholic religion growing up and their distaste of it because of the way it was forced upon them so strictly.  But because of certain situations in their life that has caused them pain, these characters realize that they need God in their life and they convert themselves into Catholics.The writer, Evelyn Waugh is a Catholic convert and some may see this film as a positive storyline of the journey of how people who are not a Catholic somehow grow to find God and finally end their sinful ways and become closer to God by converting.  And if many people in the world can do that and dedicate their life to God, then possibly an atheist like Charles Ryder can also change?By saying that, this is by no means a Christian or a Catholic film, nor is this a film that you want to show your church group.  The fact is that the director decided to end the ambiguity between Charles Ryder and Sebastian Flyte's relationship and not make it platonic but two men who care fondly for each other and are quite romantic.  Their is a lot of infidelity going on in this film.""BRIDESHEAD REVISTED"" is one of those films that may or may not be for everyone because of it's touchy subject.  You have on one hand, a group so passionate about the novel and drama series who have a bit of disdain because the story has been condensed and changed.  But at the same time, I'm sure there are people like myself who never read the original book, nor have watched the original drama series that can view this film and just be entertained by the beauty of the art that surrounds Brideshead, the beautiful scenery and locations where this film was shot.  And just enjoy its pleasant but yet intricate storyline featuring spectacular performances from the talent in this film.I know that I'm probably missing out on many other storylines and major character development points that were featured prominently in the novel.  There's only so much you can do in a two hour film.  But I personally enjoyed the film and found it beautiful in so many ways and again, the performances by Emma Thompson and Matthew Goode and the others were fantastic.So, ""BRIDESHEAD REVISITED"" was an enjoyable film in my book.  Definitely give this DVD a try!",5,"A fantastic and beautiful film.

1198823,A2RQ0AT4XZUIXL,B001GXQSWE,Dr. Cathy Goodwin,"[8, 9]","Brideshead Revisited is one of my favorite books. When the 1980 BBC series came out, I watched all the episodes and re-read the book. This movie is a ghost of the original.As others have noted, the original was a deeply nuanced story with considerable ambiguity. Characters were three-dimensional. Sebastian above all was at once charismatic, flamboyant and tragic. Lady Marchmain was a sympathetic figure. Julia was complex and confident.Here Sebastian is shown as a thin, vulnerable rebel. He's pitiful. Ryder comes across first as a hanger-on, then a busybody, Julia as an obnoxious tease.Some scenes seem to be added. I don't remember the scene between Rex and Charles, discussing Julia, from before. I don't remember Julia's angry confrontation with Charles.As others have noted, Waugh was a strong Catholic. The movie actually presented the Catholic Church in a positive light, showing the deep emotional bond the family members experienced despite their personal frustrations with the everyday implication of the religion. Here the lines are more sharply drawn.The climactic scene with Lord Marchmain was important and symbolic when the book was written.

The screenplay lost several essential parts of the novel and what we are offered is yet again charming, lovely etc but noticeably clueless. It is fairly obvious that a novel of such complexity (in case you missed it - yes, it is a novel of great complexity!) cannot be faithfully presented during two hours, still it is not an excuse for going against its spirit. Somehow the limited time did not stop the authors from introducing most of the original characters even if most them do not get a chance to utter two full sentences in the movie.Brideshead Revisited is a story of spiritual maturation of an artist set against the decline of the English aristocracy. Charles Ryder of the movie is an artist basically because we are told so quite repeatedly. Yes, he draws once, hangs a painting on the wall, and makes an appearance at an art show. Most of us have done as much in life and we don't think of ourselves as artists.Part of the maturation is fascination with the beautiful Lord Sebastian Flyte (I find Ben Whishaw somewhat lacking in masculine beauty and a bathing scene stolen from Talented Mr Ripley did not help a bit) which Waugh sees as juvenile and aesthetic (and vaguely homoerotic although not necessarily homosexual). However, it is only a stage of emotional development which after some years leads Charles towards a heterosexual relation with Sebastian's sister Julia.This vision of development of a young man of British upper classes is apparently beyond the grasp of modern screenplay writers (the times are different, it is true) even if they actually included Cara (Sebastian's father Italian lover) expressing it most clearly. Consequently, the two siblings fight for the attention and affection of Mr Ryder in the lovely setting of Venice. When Julia wins the contest, Sebastian succumbs to alcoholism. This in turn elegantly spares the authors from any attempts of explaining his lot in any other way - he drinks himself to death because he was rejected by his lover. Neat, simple, and completely against the spirit of the novel. Not very convincing, however, as when Julia makes it clear in the movie that her conquest was meant mostly to spite her brother (why, one might ask?) Sebastian fails to notice the fact completely, further succumbing to alcoholism.Probably, the spirit of the novel was too closely related to the Holy Spirit that the authors needed to exorcise at least some of it. They failed to note, however, that it was precisely the spiritual backbone that kept this (I agree) somewhat clueless though doubtlessly charming novel together. The result makes a nice viewing but if it leaves you asking endless questions ""Why? Why? Why?"" you have to resort to the original.

For this viewer the experience offered by writers Andrew Davies and Jeremy Brock and as directed with such style by Julian Jarrold offers a far more interesting examination of the damages family can inflict upon children and does so with a story that flows with visual allure and consummate acting from a fine cast.The tale is well known: middle class young man enters the elegance of the wealthy class, encounters infatuation with money, art, and luxury, dawdles with a same sex infatuation with the spoiled brat of the family only to find love with the brat's sister under the influence of a journey to Venice, and ultimately has to face the realities of class distinction, religious bigotry, and a family history in tatters.  WW I and WW II influence the development of the tale and in the end our middle class lad must clearly see the shallow shell that once represented all he could imagine as desirable.Matthew Goode heads the cast as the lad in question and the Brideshead Marchmain family is played to perfection by Emma Thompson, Michael Gambon, Ben Winshaw, Haley Atwell. The numerous smaller roles are shaped by such fine actors as Greta Scacchi, Felicity Jones, Ed Stoppard, Jonathan Cake, etc.  The settings in throughout England, Venice and  Morocco are stunning and the creative forces behind the costuming, music, lighting, and photography all deserve kudos.  For this viewer this is one of the more satisfying films of the past year.

1198828,A1SHNOU2ODKIDG,B001GXQSWE,Gregorio,"[5, 7]","I'm giving this three stars only because the film makers had the good sense to use Castle Howard once again as the Brideshead house and because the film is quite beautiful to look at.  Acting performances are decent.  The music is gorgeous.  But why on earth would anyone bother to remake this when a perfect eleven hour film version already existed?  No matter how good this film might have turned out, it would always be second best. It really isn't even a close second.  Outlandish changes to the novel occur throughout the film and so many key scenes are left out altogether, only to be replaced by scenes that never occured in the novel.  The story becomes so changed that there isn't much of Evelyn Waugh left in it.  This is a dumbed down version that offers no new insights to the material.  Perhaps worst of all is the miscasting of Ben Whishaw as Sebastian Flyte.  The character of Sebastian is supposed to be the most beautiful man at Oxford, yet Whishaw appears gaunt, frightening and just plain unattractive.  Matthew Goode as Charles Ryder is far better looking than this Sebastian and it seems unlikely that he could ever be attracted by Sebastian's beauty.  The eccentricities of Sebastian's character (including his beloved Teddy Bear) are downplayed far too much.  I suppose this is to bring Julia, played by Hayley Atwell to the center of the story more quickly.  In fact, the character of Sebastian is more of a minor character in this version, with Julia always at center stage (even accompanying Charles and Sebastian on their trip to Venice).  While it was wonderful to dive back into the world of Brideshead and see it from a different perspective, this film version is far inferior to the original film or the novel that it is based upon.  Far too many liberties have been taken with the original material and this can't simply be passed off as condensing the story for the sake of time.  This is a deliberate attempt to change the very nature and meaning of the Waugh novel.

I knew going in that a 2-hour movie treatment could only scratch the surface of a 12-hour series, but I was curious, especially given the raves for Emma Thompson.  I confess that's it's been far too long since I saw the series, but some elements seemed completely foreign to me, including the blatant homosexuality on display as well as the horrific coldness of Lady Marchmain.  Emma Thompson bravely plays against her usual warm persona and braver still, makes herself 20 years older as the chilly matriarch of a screwed-up aristocratic family.  The screwed-upness is due entirely to her and to her obsession with the Church, this version says.  I think given another decade and a few more plummy parts like this and Ms. Thompson will be known as Dame Emma Thompson, and rightly so.  Hayley Atwell (recently seen as Kiera Knightley's romantic rival in ""The Duchess"" wears bobbed hair and red lips fetchingly, but doesn't really project the emotional heft to make herself worth a man selling his soul for.The central friendship between Charles Ryder and Sebastian is what drives this story, despite all the pretty set dressing surrounding it.  In contrast to Irons' and Andrews' dark/light dynamic, both actors here are brunet and their chemistry together feels discordant.  Ben Whishaw is so physically slight and vaguely creepy-looking, it's hard to accept him as the bon vivant of Oxford that Sebastian supposedly is.  His physicality is all the more fragile when set beside strapping Matthew Goode.  Mr. Goode is the real jewel in this cast . . . in some angles he startlingly resembles Jeremy Irons, and his voice is so like Irons', one wonders if he watched the miniseries and practiced his line readings.  Mr. Goode is better-looking than his predecessor and captures Charles' outsider status wonderfully.  And if I didn't know better, I'd think he was Irons' son.The production design and costumes are beautiful, but as rendered here, Waugh's tale becames a superficial and silly proceeding, populated by only self-serving, stupid individuals.

First of all, it is impossible to encapsulate the sweep of this magnificent novel in a little over 2 hours, so the script writer chose to tease out several threads of themes of the novel and weave them into a different tapestry. Just as the themes of Austen's ""Pride and Prejudice"" have been used over and over in various interpretations, Brideshead includes enough material for many, many different stories and films. Perhaps the producers should have chosen to give the film a different name, which would have quelled the critics who claim that this is not an accurate retelling of the original story.Taken on its own, without reference to the book or the original BBC series, this is a sumptuously filmed, rich and moving story. The casting and costumes and sets are all superb. The themes of homosexuality, lost love, family conflict, alcoholism, aristocracy, and the role of Catholicism are all inherent in the book, but perhaps more subtly stated than in the film.I love to watch period productions created with such an exacting perfectionism as to period details, and this one fits the bill. If you put aside the fact that this is not an accurate retelling of the story in the book, and just enjoy it for what it is, there is much to enjoy in this film.",4,Brideshead - An Alternate Interpretation,1377993600,"09 1, 2013",2013,1408,"['Fans', 'book', 'previous', '12-hour', 'BBC', 'mini-series', 'will', 'be', 'critical', '2', 'hour', 'interpretation', 'epic', 'story', 'Brideshead', 'Revisited', 'First', 'all', 'impossible', 'encapsulate', 'sweep', 'magnificent', 'novel', 'little', '2', 'hours', 'script', 'writer', 'chose', 'tease', 'out', 'several', 'threads', 'themes', 'novel', 'weave', 'different', 'tapestry', 'Just', 'themes', 'Austen', 'Pride', 'Prejudice', 'have', 'been', 'used', 'various', 'interpretations', 'Brideshead', 'enough', 'material', 'many', 'many', 'different', 'stories', 'films', 'Perhaps', 'producers', 'should', 'have', 'chosen', 'give', 'film', 'different', 'name', 'would', 'have', 'quelled', 'critics', 'who', 'claim', 'not', 'accurate', 'retelling', 'original', 'story.Taken', 'own', 'reference', 'book', 'original', 'BBC', 'series', 'sumptuously', 'filmed', 'rich', 'moving', 'story', 'casting', 'costumes', 'sets', 'are', 'superb', 'themes', 'homosexuality', 'lost', 'love', 'family', 'conflict', 'alcoholism', 'aristocracy', 'role', 'Catholicism', 'are', 'inherent', 'book', 'perhaps', 'more', 'subtly', 'stated', 'film.I', 'love', 'watch', 'period', 'productions', 'created', 'such', 'exacting', 'perfectionism', 'period', 'details', 'one', 'bill', 'put', 'aside', 'fact', 'not', 'accurate', 'retelling', 'story', 'book', 'just', 'enjoy', 'what', 'much', 'enjoy', 'film']",Brideshead Revisited
1198832,A2B0DPQK20LYYJ,B001GXQSWE,J. Michael,"[44, 57]","Many cinematic adaptations of famous novels fail miserably because of poor casting, bad acting, horrible scripts, or a general inability to capture the spirit of the book, all of which are true about this adaptation of Brideshead Revisited. However, I have never before seen a movie which has deliberately and maliciously perverted the core message- the very soul- of its source material, as this movie does. ""Brideshead Revisited- 2009"" is an abomination. It is an artistic and spiritual obscenity that deserves utter oblivion. Let it be anathema.Evelyn Waugh, a Catholic convert, wrote a novel steeped in very Catholic ideas of sin and redemption, with its main theme being the operation of Divine Grace upon the soul. This putrid and dishonest movie has utterly discarded the central theme of the book and replaced it with a tawdry bisexual love triangle and anti-religious agitprop. This movie resembles the story we know only in outward appearance- the names of characters, certain locales and plot superficialities- but it is a gutted structure; its very heart and soul have been removed and replaced with something vile.The scriptwriters were quite honest in their intentions. They announced that God would be the villain of the story, and religious guilt its theme. To be sure, I don't recall ever having seen a movie animated by such naked anti-Catholic hatred. Lady Marchmain, a figure of Mother Church in the novel, is portrayed here as a diabolic cult leader, a dead-eyed, heartless monster who robotically spews Church dogma and controls her family through manipulation of their religious feelings. In this movie, Julia's conscience was aroused not by grace but only because she was indoctrinated when she was young. Sebastian conducts a pantomime Eucharistic celebration with Charles. Charles' conversion isn't even acknowledged. One anti-Catholic diatribe follows another. When even Christopher Hitchens says that the movie was ""motivated by the cheaper sort of malice"" against Catholicism, you know that what you're witnessing is a bona fide hate crime.To give one example of how mendaciously this movie has perverted the novel's original intent, take the dialogue between Cara and Charles about how much Lord Marchmain hates his wife - here's the book: ""And how has she deserved all this hate? She has done nothing except be loved by someone who was not grown-up...She is a good and simple woman who has been loved in the wrong way. When people hate with all that energy, it is something in themselves they are hating. Alex is hating all the illusions of boyhood-innocence, God, hope. Poor Lady Marchmain has to bear all that."" Now, the movie: ""That woman nearly suffocated him...Just look at her children. Even when they were tiny in the nursery they must do what she want them to do, be what she want them to be, only then would she love them. It's not Lady Marchmain fault. Her God has done that to her.""The movie tells us that if not for religion, Sebastian could be a happy homosexual, Julia and Charles could enjoy their adulterous relationship and Lord Marchmain could divorce his wife. To the scriptwriters, as to their modern audience, the idea that guilt may be a natural and salutary reaction to sin is completely foreign. For we in the West live among a pullulating mass of spiritual barbarians (and I mean spiritual in the broadest sense): not so much nihilistic as just morally retarded. They are shiny, one-dimensional bipeds, mere simulacra of human beings, who never even possessed a faith that they could reject. Marinated in the shabbiest materialism and various trendy theories of self-esteem, the plastic generations of the past few decades grew up to hold one, enduring core value: narcissism. If previous generations of atheists declared that Man is the Measure of All Things, these empty, tattooed husks who fill the schools and are starting to enter into positions of power, declare that_I_Am the Measure of All Things. Even the pagans valued the cultivation of the higher sensibilities- aesthetics, ethics, philosophy- but these savages whom the West has nurtured in its bosom are unable to grasp any concept beyond that of physical comfort- never mind Truth or Beauty! Incapable of even ""sinning boldly"", they go about joylessly gratifying the banal impulses of consumerism. Ignorant of where they came from, unaware of where they're going and barely cognizant of where they are now, they are the audience for Brideshead Revisited-2009.Because of that, I'm afraid the anti-religious message was probably wasted on an audience who's never known God in the first place. I could just see them watching this movie, their senses momentarily diverted by vivid scenery and semi-attractive people, but their dull minds in a state of perplexity, as if faced with the inexplicable taboos of a primitive tribe: ""God? Who? Sin? What? Guilt? Huh?"".As for the rest of it, this movie fails in every respect. The ""epicene beauty"" Sebastian looks like an angry gnome and minces about in revoltingly queenly style. Charles resembles a gormless halibut. The ""Byronic"" Lord Marchmain (played by Dumbledore from Harry Potter) looks and acts like a plumber. Julia has all the grace and charm of a reality show contestant who lifts her top for the cameras. And worst of all, Evelyn Waugh's absolutely exquisite prose was replaced with the most insipid and nonsensical dialogue that the products of modern government education factories could churn out.  If you possess a modicum of good taste, or intelligence, or a spark of the Divine, I warn you not to waste your time or soil yourself with this trash.",1,An Abomination. A Hate Crime.

I find this production 'An Exercise In Cowardness' and regard it as completely missing the point.

I'm quite sure that the book and mini-series would have been completely forgotten if Evelyn Waugh had done the same. I'm glad he didn't and that he gave the world Charles and Sebastian: the fascinating story of a hyper-complex and extremely multi-faceted relationship between two young men, bringing together religion and athesm, gay and straight, an aristocrat and a burgher, the sexual and the platonic, art and the...well...art of falling apart, a near orphan and a family-member, an alcoholic and social drinker, heaven and hell, an excentric and a square, and so on and on.

1198834,A2TUA4VWCMNXI,B001GXQSWE,John D. Cofield,"[94, 103]","Any film of Brideshead Revisited will inevitably be compared with the 1981 mini-series, and will suffer from the comparison.  Evelyn Waugh's novel was so rich and detailed that any attempt to depict it in a mere 2 hours or so will be wanting.  I am a fan of the mini-series, which I have watched countless times, and I want to make it clear that there are many things about this version that I find very appealing: the use of Castle Howard, the fine acting by Michael Gambon, Emma Thompson, Hayley Atwell, Ben Whishaw, and Matthew Goode, and the beautiful sets and costumes.Unfortunately the need to compress the story distorts much of what Evelyn Waugh intended.  By making the love affairs between Charles Ryder and Sebastian and Julia Flyte occur nearly simultaneously instead of Charles first loving Sebastian and then years later falling in love with Julia, Waugh's message of spiritual and emotional growth is blunted. More troubling is the lack of positive emphasis on Christianity and Roman Catholicism.  Whereas in the book and the mini-series Lady Marchmain is a tragic, sympathetic figure, the film emphasizes her hauteur and coldness.  This has larger immplications than just a difference in interpretation, since Lady Marchmain in large part represents the Church. Furthermore, I am especially disappointed by the ending. In the book and mini-series we see an affirmation of both new and enduring faith, while the film is far more equivocal.Despite these reservations, I do value this film and intend to watch it many times. While Waugh himself would be horrified over some of the modifications (he would call them distortions), this new interpretation of his work is beautiful in its own right, and its ambiguities are a challenge which allows us to re-examine our own beliefs.",4,"Brideshead, Revisited With Reservations",1232582400,"01 22, 2009",2009,1791,"['film', 'Brideshead', 'Revisited', 'will', 'inevitably', 'be', 'compared', '1981', 'mini-series', 'will', 'suffer', 'comparison', 'Evelyn', 'Waugh', 'novel', 'was', 'so', 'rich', 'detailed', 'attempt', 'depict', 'mere', '2', 'hours', 'so', 'will', 'be', 'wanting', 'am', 'fan', 'mini-series', 'have', 'watched', 'countless', 'times', 'want', 'make', 'clear', 'are', 'many', 'things', 'version', 'find', 'very', 'appealing', 'use', 'Castle', 'Howard', 'fine', 'acting', 'Michael', 'Gambon', 'Emma', 'Thompson', 'Hayley', 'Atwell', 'Ben', 'Whishaw', 'Matthew', 'Goode', 'beautiful', 'sets', 'costumes.Unfortunately', 'need', 'compress', 'story', 'much', 'what', 'Evelyn', 'Waugh', 'intended', 'making', 'love', 'affairs', 'Charles', 'Ryder', 'Sebastian', 'Julia', 'Flyte', 'occur', 'nearly', 'simultaneously', 'instead', 'Charles', 'first', 'loving', 'Sebastian', 'then', 'years', 'later', 'falling', 'love', 'Julia', 'Waugh', 'message', 'spiritual', 'emotional', 'growth', 'blunted', 'More', 'troubling', 'lack', 'positive', 'emphasis', 'Christianity', 'Roman', 'Catholicism', 'Whereas', 'book', 'mini-series', 'Lady', 'Marchmain', 'tragic', 'sympathetic', 'figure', 'film', 'hauteur', 'coldness', 'larger', 'immplications', 'just', 'difference', 'interpretation', 'Lady', 'Marchmain', 'large', 'part', 'Church', 'Furthermore', 'am', 'especially', 'disappointed', 'ending', 'book', 'mini-series', 'see', 'affirmation', 'new', 'enduring', 'faith', 'film', 'far', 'more', 'equivocal.Despite', 'reservations', 'do', 'value', 'film', 'intend', 'watch', 'many', 'times', 'would', 'be', 'horrified', 'modifications', 'would', 'call', 'distortions', 'new', 'interpretation', 'work', 'beautiful', 'own', 'right', 'ambiguities', 'are', 'challenge', 're-examine', 'own', 'beliefs']",Brideshead Revisited
1198835,A61RNXZ3HWKGB,B001GXQSWE,"John Murphy ""O, for a Muse of Fire""","[18, 22]","So...""Brideshead Revisited"" by Evelyn Waugh is one of the twentieth century's classic novels. It's not especially long. A week or so should do the trick. Don't have the time? Well, there was a superlative miniseries adaptation of the novel produced by Granada in the early 80s starring Jeremy Irons, Anthony Andrews, Claire Bloom, Laurence Olivier, and John Gielgud. It's roughly 10 hours long, but is an enrapturing experience. Too much of an investment? Hmmm...well, there's this recent movie version that crams everything into about two hours and flagrantly violates Evelyn Waugh's original vision....are you sure you don't have time to at least start the book?This good-looking but curiously bland version of ""Brideshead"" might prompt those unfamiliar with Waugh to wonder why all the bother. The story seems banal in this slick but slack adaptation. Middle-class aspiring painter Charles Ryder meets wealthy and flamboyant Lord Sebastian Flyte at Oxford and is drawn into the Flyte family melodrama, which is reduced in this version to the struggle between Catholic faith and personal freedom. Lady Marchmain rules over her vast roost, Brideshead, like God on high, trying to keep her rebellious twins, Julia and Sebastian, in line, according to ""God's will.""All the actors, including the one-and-only Emma Thompson, feel like disappointing, underprepared understudies compared to their miniseries' counterparts. Charles Ryder is a difficult character to make sympathetic: an agnostic (atheist in this version, another mistake: Ryder's agnosticism in the book and miniseries is part-and-parcel of his general lack of convictions) social climber with a rather bland personality, and Matthew Goode's performance is as dull as ditchwater (he's a very good actor -- see ""Match Point"" and ""The Lookout"" for evidence -- so I'm going to blame the script/direction).Sebastian Flyte, one of literature's most fascinating and mysterious characters, is especially ill-served by the new adaptation. Ben Whishaw, who is also by all accounts a very fine actor (I could absolutely see him as Hamlet, a role he played on stage to great acclaim), seems simpering, self-pitying, and silly compared to the heartrending pathos of Anthony Andrews' performance in the miniseries, and certainly lacks ""that epicene quality which in extreme youth sings aloud for love and withers at the first cold wind,"" as Waugh describes Sebastian. Here he is a caricature of a closeted, Catholic homosexual. Andrews gave Sebastian so much dignity and pathos in the miniseries that it's painful to see the character reduced to only one-dimension here.Perhaps it's unfair to compare the faithful ten-hour television adaptation to this two-hour travesty, but it's not just the details the new film is lacking; it's Waugh's entire vision. Waugh wrote that he intended the novel to ""trace the workings of the divine purpose in a pagan world.""  The screenplay by Andrew Davies (usually better than this) and Jeremy Brock flattens the novel's shades and textures into a simplistic, two-toned face-off between faith and freedom. Lady Marchmain is made an imperious harridan, imposing her will like a distant god on her poor children. By demonizing Lady Marchmain, the screenwriters lift any burden of responsibility off the shoulders of Sebastian and Julia, both of whom have rich and complex interior lives (and a profound sense of sin and guilt) in the novel and miniseries. The intricate relationship between Sebastian and Charles in the movie is simplified to unreciprocated homoeroticism -- an invented Venetian kiss between Charles and Julia drives Sebastian to a hissy fit and dypsomania that is as unflattering of homosexuality as it is of Catholicism. This ""Brideshead"" is an equal opportunity offender.Waugh isn't just rolling in his grave, he's spinning like a top. Even militant atheist Christopher Hitchens came to reactionary Waugh's defense against this version, writing, ""I do not consider myself a sympathiser with Roman Catholicism, but this film seems motivated by the cheaper sort of malice against it,"" and added that it is ""barely a travesty."" Whether you agree or not with Waugh's ornery conservatism, he was a great writer and certainly not an apologist or proselytizer of religion (plenty of the religious characters in ""Brideshead"" come off quite badly).

Unfortunately for the rest of us, it would seen Hollywood can think of nothing new to do with itself and so is content to either rehash old formulas or revisit the past and do the oft times unwarranted and usually blunder laden re-make.  And so we have this two hour version of Brideshead Revisited.  And more is the pity for it.  Because  the sad truth of the matter is, this will for some be seen as the only version that counts because it was done up like a tart by Hollywood and put before us as a ready made classic.For the those of us who have read the book this film is a slap in the face to the author who wrote with such considerate beauty and warm subtly of a fading way of life, the complexities of religion, and the raging currents of the heart.  It takes the themes of the books and manipulates them in such a way as to make the intent of the author seem irrelevant to the telling of the story.  The religious aspect of the film is so heavy laden as to make one think of the Spanish Inquisition.  The author by comparison gave what I believe was a fair handed examination of religion and the rebellion religion can sometimes cause against it.  It was  done with consideration and aptitude where as the film basically bashes both the people who practice it and the religion itself for no other reason than the writer and director could.To those of us who have seen and adore the 1981 PBS mini-series, this is an unabashed disaster.  This film takes away the detail and lushness of the former.  The haunting longing of first love and rebellion of all things as it tries to adhere to the conventional even as it is slowly but inevitably fading.  This film with its short attention span makes the relationships between Charles, Sebastian and Julia simultaneous rather than taking its time and showing the gap in years between both relationships.  The homoerotic relationship between Sebastian and Charles with its glances and touches, the ambiguity of their relationship which is hinted at and therefore gives it an urgency (because we know it was then and still to this day by some was socially unacceptable), its tenderness (because we see the seeds of first love planted and tended to with adoring hands), its tragedy (because we know in our hearts as much as we might want it to be different it cannot last), have been stripped away in the film.  In its place we get a harried cramming together and utter distortion of both relationships.In the mini-series we get to know and love Sebastian in the same way Charles does, making what happens to Sebastian as haunting as it is tragic.  Making us long for that long ago summer the two spent alone at Brideshead when they were young and the world lay before them a thing to be explored and unafraid of.  Sebastian being the symbol of an aristocracy that is no longer needed and was leaving the stage for younger , fairer actors to prance about.  Leaving not with its head held high but cast rather as lost to itself and confused as to how it got where it ended up.How could anyone but the indomitable Jeremy Irons ever been seen as the love seeking, artistic, dreamer Charles or Anthony Andrews as the marvelous, charming and tragic Sebastian?If you want to see Brideshead Revisited in all of its wondrous glory I suggest you rent or better yet buy the 1981 PBS mini-series also on sell here at Amazon, instead of wasting your time on this dreck.",2,Suffers the shift in format,1240272000,"04 21, 2009",2009,3542,"['first', 'thing', 'came', 'mind', 'when', 'heard', 'was', 'going', 'be', 'film', 'adaptation', 'Brideshead', 'was', 'shudder', 'utter', 'disbelief', 'Unfortunately', 'rest', 'would', 'seen', 'Hollywood', 'can', 'think', 'nothing', 'new', 'do', 'so', 'content', 'rehash', 'old', 'formulas', 'revisit', 'past', 'do', 'oft', 'times', 'unwarranted', 'usually', 'blunder', 'laden', 're-make', 'so', 'have', 'two', 'hour', 'version', 'Brideshead', 'Revisited', 'more', 'pity', 'sad', 'truth', 'matter', 'will', 'be', 'seen', 'only', 'version', 'was', 'done', 'up', 'tart', 'Hollywood', 'put', 'before', 'ready', 'made', 'classic.For', 'who', 'have', 'read', 'book', 'film', 'slap', 'face', 'author', 'who', 'wrote', 'such', 'considerate', 'beauty', 'warm', 'subtly', 'fading', 'way', 'life', 'complexities', 'religion', 'raging', 'currents', 'heart', 'themes', 'books', 'way', 'make', 'intent', 'author', 'seem', 'irrelevant', 'telling', 'story', 'religious', 'aspect', 'film', 'so', 'heavy', 'laden', 'make', 'one', 'think', 'Spanish', 'Inquisition', 'author', 'comparison', 'gave', 'what', 'believe', 'was', 'fair', 'handed', 'examination', 'religion', 'rebellion', 'religion', 'can', 'sometimes', 'cause', 'was', 'done', 'consideration', 'aptitude', 'where', 'film', 'basically', 'people', 'who', 'practice', 'religion', 'other', 'reason', 'writer', 'director', 'could.To', 'who', 'have', 'seen', '1981', 'PBS', 'mini-series', 'unabashed', 'disaster', 'film', 'away', 'detail', 'lushness', 'former', 'haunting', 'longing', 'first', 'love', 'rebellion', 'things', 'adhere', 'conventional', 'even', 'slowly', 'inevitably', 'fading', 'film', 'short', 'attention', 'span', 'relationships', 'Charles', 'Sebastian', 'Julia', 'simultaneous', 'rather', 'taking', 'time', 'showing', 'gap', 'years', 'relationships', 'homoerotic', 'relationship', 'Sebastian', 'Charles', 'glances', 'touches', 'ambiguity', 'relationship', 'hinted', 'therefore', 'urgency', 'know', 'was', 'then', 'still', 'day', 'was', 'socially', 'unacceptable', 'tenderness', 'see', 'seeds', 'first', 'love', 'planted', 'tended', 'adoring', 'hands', 'tragedy', 'know', 'hearts', 'as', 'much', 'might', 'want', 'be', 'different', 'can', 'not', 'last', 'have', 'been', 'stripped', 'away', 'film', 'place', 'get', 'harried', 'cramming', 'together', 'utter', 'distortion', 'relationships.In', 'mini-series', 'get', 'know', 'love', 'Sebastian', 'same', 'way', 'Charles', 'making', 'what', 'Sebastian', 'as', 'haunting', 'tragic', 'Making', 'long', 'long', 'ago', 'summer', 'two', 'spent', 'alone', 'Brideshead', 'when', 'were', 'young', 'world', 'lay', 'thing', 'be', 'explored', 'unafraid', 'Sebastian', 'being', 'symbol', 'aristocracy', 'longer', 'needed', 'was', 'leaving', 'stage', 'younger', 'fairer', 'actors', 'prance', 'about', 'Leaving', 'not', 'head', 'held', 'high', 'cast', 'rather', 'lost', 'confused', 'how', 'got', 'where', 'ended', 'up.How', 'could', 'anyone', 'indomitable', 'Jeremy', 'Irons', 'ever', 'been', 'seen', 'love', 'seeking', 'artistic', 'dreamer', 'Charles', 'Anthony', 'Andrews', 'marvelous', 'charming', 'tragic', 'Sebastian', 'want', 'see', 'Brideshead', 'Revisited', 'wondrous', 'glory', 'suggest', 'rent', 'better', 'yet', 'buy', '1981', 'PBS', 'mini-series', 'also', 'sell', 'here', 'Amazon', 'instead', 'wasting', 'time', 'dreck']",Brideshead Revisited

The focus is then on the romance between Charles and Lady Julia Flyte, which arises without explanation, is completely devoid of any kind of sparks or chemistry, and sputters out without any real emotion from either party.Emma Thompson is of course, excellent as the rigidly Catholic Lady Marchmain. Michael Gambon is also great in his few scenes as the renegade Lord Marchmain. And Ben Whishaw is believably tragic as the tortured alcoholic, homosexual and perpetually adolescent Sebastian Flyte.

1198845,A36EW68H08UOCS,B001GXQSWE,"Mark J. Fowler ""Let's Play Two!""","[3, 4]","This production of Evelyn Waugh's famous novel suffers in comparison to not only the novel (the well-known ""the book was far better"" syndrome) and to the eleven hour production of twenty-eight years ago, which placed 10th in a recent poll of the 100 Greatest British Television Programmes, but also to recent period costume dramas including Merchant-Ivory productions like ""Remains of the Day"" and ""Howard's End"" and a host of Jane Austin film adaptations like ""Sense and Sensibility"" and ""Pride and Prejudice"". (Emma Thompson's appearance in Brideshead and most of these other productions fosters the need for comparison.)The book, fleshed out nicely in eleven hours, has to be truncated for a two hour version.  Some themes are left intact, but others get short-changed.Matthew Goode stars as Charles Ryder, raised by a father who is eccentric and amusing in the book, but cold and emotionally disconnected in this film.  When Charles goes to tell Dad ""bye"" on his way to Oxford, his father asks where he is going.  Charles says ""Oxford"" and Dad asks ""what are you taking again?"" Charles tells him ""history."" Dad doesn't move from the breakfast table as Charles goes away for months.On day one at the dorm Charles meets Sebastian Flyte when Sebastian rushes across the courtyard and sticks his head inside Charles' room just in time to lose his alcohol-soaked lunch.Sebastian sends elaborate flowers and a large apology note, inviting Charles to join Sebastian's inner circle for lunch the next day.  Sebastian's group is comprised primarily of blue-blood chaps who prefer chaps.  As in the book, thus begins the tentative courting of Charles by Sebastian.Sebastian is the youngest son of Lord and Lady Marchmain, played by Michael Gambon and Emma Thompson.  The Marchmains live at Brideshead, a palatial estate so splendid that the built-in chapel is more elaborate than any church short of a cathedral.  Lady Marchmain is a staunch catholic and raises her children to be strong in the faith as well.  Lord Marchmain converted to Catholicism so that he could marry Lady Marchmain, but was so stifled by her that he has lived in Venice for years with his Italian mistress.Charles is invited to Brideshead where he meets Lady Marchmain and the rest of the children - Bridey, the eldest son and thus the hereditary heir to Brideshead, and devout younger sister Cordelia and tantalizing sister Julia, played by Hayley Atwell and looking a good bit like an English Audrey Tautou.Charles lets Sebastian make romantic overtures.  We get the idea that Charles is not bisexual, but is willing to trade a hug here and a kiss there for the opportunity to hang out at Brideshead.  But he is also attracted to Julia in a way that is noticed by others.  In this family this is a problem, not because Charles isn't a blue-blood, but because he is an atheist.Waugh was a converted Catholic himself, and his writings make it clear that he intended in the novel to portray faith as something of great value.  The climax of all versions of the story involve an unlikely demonstration of faith.  But in this film Lady Marchmain's Catholicism is a cold, stifling thing.  Rather than concern for their spiritual welfare, as in the book, she seems more bent on controlling everyone around her via her Catholicism.Sebastian's homosexuality is only exceeded by his alcoholism.  Both of these drive him from the family, and although he loves Charles, he recognizes immediately when Lady M sends him in a failed attempt to return the prodigal son.Instead of focusing on faith - both existing and lacking - the film instead focuses on lost loves, ships passing in the night, and making incomplete compromises against your true self to gain some short or long-time goal.Is Charles willing to convert to Catholicism to woo Julia?

1198846,A2FHQVL4ZG0E1O,B001GXQSWE,"MartinP ""MartinP""","[81, 89]","When I first heard of this film I found it hard to imagine how anyone could succeed in cramming the complex narrative of Brideshead Revisited into the 120 minute format that seems to be the norm for cinema these days, maybe as a favour to audiences suffering from attention deficit disorder. Still, I didn't expect much from Pride & Prejudice the movie, yet found myself enjoying that pretty well, so I took my chances with Brideshead too. But this time the experience was rather less satisfying, to put it mildly.For someone familiar with the large, intricate, subtly tinted canvases of Waugh's book and the phenomenal TV-series, this is like seeing a hasty copy executed in crude strokes and garish colours. Within 20 minutes from the start Charles and Sebastian aren't just friends, they actually appear to be lovers. The gay thing is plastered on way too thick and goes far beyond anything suggested by Waugh. The way the storyline is distorted, it makes it seems as if Sebastian starts drinking out of frustration over Charles's rejection of him in favour of his sister Julia. This is a result of the extreme conflation of elements from Waugh's story, which uproots its refined psychological dynamics. Indeed, subtlety is nowhere to be found; the Flytes in this movie are a pretty vulgar bunch, and Sebastian's Oxford circle too has none of the aristocratic manners and sophisticated wit we would expect from them.There are in this film many more scenes that made me cringe than in any movie I recently watched:  the Flytes gathering around a statue of the Virgin Mary, singing the Salve Regina; Lady Marchmain coming to the house of Charles's father and throwing an emotional scene; all appearances of Anthony Blanch, period (mercifully limited to only two); Charles buying Julia from Mottram for a few paintings; Sebastian making a scene at his sister's coming out ball; et cetera.The casting doesn't help. Matthew Goode is a likeable Charles Ryder, but way too mature and confident, with the added problem of him being rather more handsome than Sebastian, who is played by the gaunt, scary-looking Ben Wishaw. Wishaw completely misses out on the complicated combination of superiority and vulnerability in Sebastian's deeply troubled character, indeed, seems to spend most of his screentime throwing fond looks at Charles (which is just about the reverse of what happens in the original story). Hayley Atwell's Julia lacks any sense of grandeur or style, and is reduced to little more than a petulant schoolgirl; I couldn't for the life of me imagine why Charles would fall in love with her, there is no chemistry at all between the characters. I'm sure Emma Thompson could have made something wonderful out of Lady Marchmain had she been given the right lines, but alas; here she is just a gorgon, who, like others characters too, may surprise you by suddenly going psychotherapist, explaining to Charles that he is so desperate to be liked. None of the subtle emotional blackmail that Claire Bloom so masterfully weaved into her performance in the series. Most other characters could have been dispensed with altogether; with their organic ties to the story severed, figures like Blanche, Ryder's father, Boy Mulcaster, cousin Jasper, Cordelia, Samgrass, or Celia make mere token appearances.So what you are left with is a bunch of fairly good-looking, nicely dressed people cavorting in attractive surroundings. No clich&eacute; is spared. We don't just go to Venice, no, of course it has to be the Carnival and the Lido. Castle Howard is always a pleasure to look at but hardly an original choice (and I don't understand by the life of me why everybody is constantly arriving at and departing from the garden front - maybe so as not to disturb the business of tourism? We do not once see the other side. The house was used much more fully in the TV-series.) Surprisingly, the series despite its 4:3 ratio generally has a far more cinematic feel to it than this film, which often looks made-for-TV. No doubt some will argue that such comparisons are unfair and the film should be judged on its own merits alone; I disagree. Right up to the final scene, the entire point of Waugh's story is lost. Anyone who films the work of a great author takes on a responsibility towards that work, and the makers of this film have definitely failed in that regard, i.e., they just mangled it.",2,You don't want to revisit this Brideshead,1236988800,"03 14, 2009",2009,4390,"['When', 'first', 'heard', 'film', 'found', 'hard', 'imagine', 'how', 'anyone', 'could', 'succeed', 'cramming', 'complex', 'narrative', 'Brideshead', 'Revisited', '120', 'minute', 'format', 'be', 'norm', 'cinema', 'days', 'maybe', 'favour', 'audiences', 'suffering', 'attention', 'deficit', 'disorder', 'Still', 'did', ""n't"", 'expect', 'much', 'Pride', 'Prejudice', 'movie', 'yet', 'found', 'enjoying', 'pretty', 'well', 'took', 'chances', 'Brideshead', 'too', 'time', 'experience', 'was', 'rather', 'less', 'satisfying', 'put', 'mildly.For', 'someone', 'familiar', 'large', 'intricate', 'subtly', 'tinted', 'canvases', 'Waugh', 'book', 'phenomenal', 'TV-series', 'seeing', 'hasty', 'copy', 'executed', 'crude', 'strokes', 'garish', 'colours', '20', 'minutes', 'start', 'Charles', 'Sebastian', 'are', ""n't"", 'just', 'friends', 'actually', 'appear', 'be', 'lovers', 'gay', 'thing', 'plastered', 'way', 'too', 'thick', 'far', 'anything', 'suggested', 'Waugh', 'way', 'storyline', 'distorted', 'Sebastian', 'starts', 'drinking', 'frustration', 'Charles', 'rejection', 'favour', 'sister', 'Julia', 'result', 'extreme', 'conflation', 'elements', 'Waugh', 'story', 'refined', 'psychological', 'dynamics', 'Indeed', 'subtlety', 'nowhere', 'be', 'found', 'Flytes', 'movie', 'are', 'pretty', 'vulgar', 'bunch', 'Sebastian', 'Oxford', 'circle', 'too', 'none', 'aristocratic', 'manners', 'sophisticated', 'wit', 'would', 'expect', 'are', 'film', 'many', 'more', 'scenes', 'made', 'cringe', 'movie', 'recently', 'watched', 'Flytes', 'gathering', 'statue', 'Virgin', 'Mary', 'singing', 'Salve', 'Regina', 'Lady', 'Marchmain', 'coming', 'house', 'Charles', 'father', 'throwing', 'emotional', 'scene', 'appearances', 'Anthony', 'Blanch', 'period', 'mercifully', 'limited', 'only', 'two', 'Charles', 'buying', 'Julia', 'Mottram', 'few', 'paintings', 'Sebastian', 'making', 'scene', 'sister', 'coming', 'out', 'ball', 'cetera.The', 'casting', ""n't"", 'help', 'Matthew', 'Goode', 'likeable', 'Charles', 'Ryder', 'way', 'too', 'mature', 'confident', 'added', 'problem', 'being', 'rather', 'more', 'handsome', 'Sebastian', 'who', 'played', 'gaunt', 'scary-looking', 'Ben', 'Wishaw', 'Wishaw', 'completely', 'out', 'complicated', 'combination', 'superiority', 'vulnerability', 'Sebastian', 'deeply', 'troubled', 'character', 'indeed', 'spend', 'most', 'screentime', 'throwing', 'fond', 'looks', 'Charles', 'just', 'reverse', 'what', 'original', 'story', 'Hayley', 'Atwell', 'Julia', 'sense', 'grandeur', 'style', 'reduced', 'little', 'more', 'petulant', 'schoolgirl', 'could', ""n't"", 'life', 'imagine', 'why', 'Charles', 'would', 'fall', 'love', 'chemistry', 'characters', ""'m"", 'sure', 'Emma', 'Thompson', 'could', 'have', 'made', 'something', 'wonderful', 'Lady', 'Marchmain', 'had', 'been', 'given', 'right', 'lines', 'alas', 'here', 'just', 'gorgon', 'who', 'others', 'characters', 'too', 'may', 'surprise', 'suddenly', 'going', 'psychotherapist', 'explaining', 'Charles', 'so', 'desperate', 'be', 'liked', 'None', 'subtle', 'emotional', 'blackmail', 'Claire', 'Bloom', 'so', 'masterfully', 'weaved', 'performance', 'series', 'Most', 'other', 'characters', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'dispensed', 'altogether', 'organic', 'ties', 'story', 'severed', 'figures', 'Blanche', 'Ryder', 'father', 'Boy', 'Mulcaster', 'cousin', 'Jasper', 'Cordelia', 'Samgrass', 'Celia', 'make', 'mere', 'token', 'appearances.So', 'what', 'are', 'left', 'bunch', 'fairly', 'good-looking', 'nicely', 'dressed', 'people', 'cavorting', 'attractive', 'surroundings', 'No', 'clich', 'eacute', 'spared', 'do', ""n't"", 'just', 'go', 'Venice', 'course', 'be', 'Carnival', 'Lido', 'Castle', 'Howard', 'always', 'pleasure', 'look', 'hardly', 'original', 'choice', 'do', ""n't"", 'understand', 'life', 'why', 'everybody', 'constantly', 'arriving', 'departing', 'garden', 'front', 'maybe', 'so', 'not', 'disturb', 'business', 'tourism', 'do', 'not', 'once', 'see', 'other', 'side', 'house', 'was', 'used', 'much', 'more', 'fully', 'TV-series', 'Surprisingly', 'series', '4:3', 'ratio', 'generally', 'far', 'more', 'cinematic', 'feel', 'film', 'often', 'made-for-TV', 'No', 'doubt', 'will', 'argue', 'such', 'comparisons', 'are', 'unfair', 'film', 'should', 'be', 'judged', 'own', 'merits', 'alone', 'disagree', 'Right', 'up', 'final', 'scene', 'entire', 'point', 'Waugh', 'story', 'lost', 'Anyone', 'who', 'work', 'great', 'author', 'responsibility', 'work', 'makers', 'film', 'have', 'definitely', 'failed', 'regard', 'i.e.', 'just', 'mangled']",Brideshead Revisited

The story follows the protagonist Charles Ryder (Mathew Goode), a self proclaimed atheist, as he becomes immersed in the world of the Marchmain family (stolid Catholics) and their immense and glorious estate Brideshead, from which the film draws its title. Ryder is of a lower social class: a student at Oxford, befriended by the wayward son of the Marchmain family, Sebastian. Through Sebastian, Ryder is ushered into a world unknown to him, a world that he would very much like to remain in the midst of.Ryder is entranced by the two eldest Marchmain children: Julia (Hayley Atwell) and Sebastian (Ben Whishaw), both of whom he is in love with, albeit it very different ways: infatuation with Sebastian, followed by a powerful and heartbreaking desire for Julia. In the midst of these relations is Lady Marchmain (Emma Thompson), a matriarchal mother and staunch Catholic who embodies piety and power, and who knows how to use either to affect her wishes. Emma Thompson is perfectly cast, and she steals the screen in almost every scene in which she appears. Referring to Ryder as a ""painter from Paddington,"" and ""a very reliable boy,"" she enlists his aid to watch over Sebastian, whose homosexual tendencies have not escaped her notice. Ryder is happy to comply, unable or unwilling to see the eventual outcome of his actions.The centerpiece of the massive fountain at Brideshead is the god Atlas, carrying the world on his shoulders. Shown in essential scenes throughout the film, it is an apt metaphor for virtually all of the characters in the film who each carry their formidable shame and guilt like a physical burden. Each seems unable to free themselves from the torments of conscience, even at the cost of losing the possibility of a happier life. Ultimately, it is Ryder who reflects on his life, an older and unhappily wiser man, asking ""did I want too much?""The Catholicism presented in the film is ugly, harsh, and at times even a straw-man to be battered apart by director Julian Jarrold. It is presented largely through imagery and implication, never allowed to have a voice of its own. Even near the end of the film, Jarrold forces Julia to speak in generalities: ""I cannot turn away from His mercy,"" (roughly quoted). This is my sole complaint with the film, as the  decisions made by the characters and the outcomes of those decisions do not seem to line up with the attempt at a redemptive ending. There is nothing in the film to convince the viewer, much less Ryder, than faith in a higher power has anything to offer except misery.BRIDESHEAD REVISITED is an extremely well made movie. Shot with with a lovely sense of color and style and featuring one of the best Dolby Digital sound tracks I've ever heard in a drama, the movie is near perfect from a technical standpoint. I was very impressed with the visuals and the clarity of the picture (which I watched on an upconvering DVD player).The sets and locations are also deserving of high praise. A welcome diversity of locals elevate the film from a typical period drama, and include Oxford, Castle Howard (standing in for Brideshead), Morocco, and my personal favorite, a luxury cruise liner. Art direction is also a standout, with beautiful costumes (especially those worn by Julia) throughout.BRIDESHEAD REVISITED is a challenging film for atheist and those of faith alike. The questions it asks about human nature, the fleeting nature of happiness, and the sheer difficulty of finding it, are well worth asking and well presented. Captivating throughout, this is a film worth examining closely over multiple viewings.4.5/5 Stars.",4,A powerful examination of love and guilt,1232150400,"01 17, 2009",2009,4008,"['have', 'not', 'read', 'Evelyn', 'Waugh', 'novel', 'movie', 'based', 'have', 'seen', 'BBC', 'mini', 'series', 'review', 'less', 'critical', 'standpoint', 'who', 'know', 'love', 'book', 'mini', 'series.The', 'film', 'rich', 'examination', 'how', 'love', 'guilt', 'are', 'often', 'war', 'interplay', 'class', 'religious', 'upbringing', 'how', 'incredibly', 'difficult', 'carve', 'out', 'one', 'own', 'happiness', 'story', 'protagonist', 'Charles', 'Ryder', 'Mathew', 'Goode', 'self', 'proclaimed', 'atheist', 'immersed', 'world', 'Marchmain', 'family', 'stolid', 'Catholics', 'immense', 'glorious', 'estate', 'Brideshead', 'film', 'title', 'Ryder', 'lower', 'social', 'class', 'student', 'Oxford', 'befriended', 'wayward', 'son', 'Marchmain', 'family', 'Sebastian', 'Sebastian', 'Ryder', 'ushered', 'world', 'unknown', 'world', 'would', 'very', 'much', 'remain', 'midst', 'of.Ryder', 'entranced', 'two', 'eldest', 'Marchmain', 'children', 'Julia', 'Hayley', 'Atwell', 'Sebastian', 'Ben', 'Whishaw', 'whom', 'love', 'very', 'different', 'ways', 'infatuation', 'Sebastian', 'followed', 'powerful', 'heartbreaking', 'desire', 'Julia', 'midst', 'relations', 'Lady', 'Marchmain', 'Emma', 'Thompson', 'matriarchal', 'mother', 'staunch', 'Catholic', 'who', 'piety', 'power', 'who', 'how', 'use', 'affect', 'wishes', 'Emma', 'Thompson', 'perfectly', 'cast', 'screen', 'almost', 'scene', 'Referring', 'Ryder', 'painter', 'Paddington', 'very', 'reliable', 'boy', 'aid', 'watch', 'Sebastian', 'homosexual', 'tendencies', 'have', 'not', 'escaped', 'notice', 'Ryder', 'happy', 'comply', 'unable', 'unwilling', 'see', 'eventual', 'outcome', 'actions.The', 'centerpiece', 'massive', 'fountain', 'Brideshead', 'god', 'Atlas', 'carrying', 'world', 'shoulders', 'Shown', 'essential', 'scenes', 'film', 'apt', 'metaphor', 'virtually', 'characters', 'film', 'who', 'carry', 'formidable', 'shame', 'guilt', 'physical', 'burden', 'unable', 'free', 'torments', 'conscience', 'even', 'cost', 'losing', 'possibility', 'happier', 'life', 'Ultimately', 'Ryder', 'who', 'life', 'older', 'unhappily', 'wiser', 'man', 'asking', 'did', 'want', 'too', 'much', 'Catholicism', 'presented', 'film', 'ugly', 'harsh', 'times', 'even', 'straw-man', 'be', 'battered', 'apart', 'director', 'Julian', 'Jarrold', 'presented', 'largely', 'imagery', 'implication', 'never', 'allowed', 'have', 'voice', 'own', 'Even', 'end', 'film', 'Jarrold', 'forces', 'Julia', 'speak', 'generalities', 'can', 'not', 'turn', 'away', 'mercy', 'roughly', 'quoted', 'sole', 'complaint', 'film', 'decisions', 'made', 'characters', 'outcomes', 'decisions', 'do', 'not', 'seem', 'line', 'up', 'attempt', 'redemptive', 'ending', 'nothing', 'film', 'convince', 'viewer', 'much', 'less', 'Ryder', 'faith', 'higher', 'power', 'anything', 'offer', 'misery.BRIDESHEAD', 'REVISITED', 'extremely', 'well', 'made', 'movie', 'Shot', 'lovely', 'sense', 'color', 'style', 'featuring', 'one', 'best', 'Dolby', 'Digital', 'sound', 'tracks', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'heard', 'drama', 'movie', 'perfect', 'technical', 'standpoint', 'was', 'very', 'impressed', 'visuals', 'clarity', 'picture', 'watched', 'upconvering', 'DVD', 'player', '.The', 'sets', 'locations', 'are', 'also', 'deserving', 'high', 'praise', 'welcome', 'diversity', 'locals', 'elevate', 'film', 'typical', 'period', 'drama', 'include', 'Oxford', 'Castle', 'Howard', 'standing', 'Brideshead', 'Morocco', 'personal', 'favorite', 'luxury', 'cruise', 'liner', 'Art', 'direction', 'also', 'standout', 'beautiful', 'costumes', 'especially', 'worn', 'Julia', 'throughout.BRIDESHEAD', 'REVISITED', 'challenging', 'film', 'atheist', 'faith', 'alike', 'questions', 'human', 'nature', 'fleeting', 'nature', 'happiness', 'sheer', 'difficulty', 'finding', 'are', 'well', 'worth', 'asking', 'well', 'presented', 'Captivating', 'film', 'worth', 'examining', 'closely', 'multiple', 'viewings.4.5/5', 'Stars']",Brideshead Revisited

It is a kind of book whose first pages do not want reader to put the book down.  I saw series starring Jeremy Irons in a role of Charles Ryder years ago and still cannot forget fantastic actors that were part of that project.  I knew that director of this movie had tough shoes to fill.  Is it going to ever be possible to put in 90 minutes complexities of fine cast of characters of this unforgetable story?Surely, visual beauty of Brideshead house, art inside it and suffocation of the place in spite of its grandness is right to the point.  M. Goode in his role of Charles Ryder is absolutely wonderful.  We see him young and pure, devoted in his friendhip and love to Sebastian and Julia and finally a broken, middle aged man with no life in him left.  While story is on track, film does not allow too much space for fantastic characters such as Cordelia, Sebastian's younger sister nor Carla, Sebastian father's Italian mistress.  For audiences not familar with these characters, this is a great loss not to know them on a deeper level.

The sets, costumes, and period detail here are suptuous. I saw the movie at the theatre, and bought it as soon as the DVD came out. It's worthy of permanent collection.The acting here is all-around good (or Goode....pun intended). Matthew Goode carries the Charles Ryder part brilliantly, and Emma Thompson exudes evil under the guise of Catholicism.BUT -- and the big but -- there is so much missing from the novel, that many story threads are simply gone, and as a result, so is the dramatic tension in the final scenes...Actions that occur over the course of years, seem to all occur almost simultanously....Charles and Sebastian were actually in love for several years before the sister comes on the scene and changes the scope and outcome of the story -- here, it all occurs almost at the same time.ALSO -- the entire shift of the story has been changed. Waugh wrote the book partially to discuss his own college years and his own eventual conversion to Catholicism. Here, it is used as an evil McGuffin...as so, it doesn't tell Waugh's tale at all -- it is its own creature.That being said, the film is completely enjoyable, moody, and filled with yearning. This is a storyline that is recognizable to both youth and older audiences.One caveat -- those looking for some ""hot gay sex"" (ala Brokeback Mountain) aren't going to find it here -- the entire sexual relationship between Sebastian and Charles is composed of one two-second kiss, and a hand touch later in the movie.  What makes the film work is that which is implied -- although the topic of homosexuality is spoken out loud much more than in the book or the mini-series.

Well, they took the names and places from the book and screenplay and made it into something which is a sort of tawdry inversion of the original thing.

1198862,A18IK6YI6T3RK2,B001GXQSWE,Shannon Deason,"[2, 5]","Let me say straight away that the film sets and  period wardrobe for this film are spectacular.  Brideshead Revisted is of course, one of the most famous novels in British Literature, it defines the word classic, so many were nervous when it was announced that a film was to made of it.  Brideshead was made as a miniseries for British T.V. many years ago and was a resounding success, but it was like 13 hours or something, this film was going to have to be condenced  into a little over two hours.  The film starts off in the present and falls back on itself, telling the story of how our protagonist Charles, reached this point.  For, the most part I liked how the film was structured, and the actor who played Sabastian was fantanstic, I only wish the actor who played Charles had been up to his standards, really that is what hurts this film the most, you never really understand Charles' motives and you really never much like him, at least I didnt.  In the early scenes at Oxford, he seems too old to be playing an undergrad and I never understood Sabastians interest in him, Charles seemed so bland and not the least bit witty or cleaver, two things that somebody like Sabastian would covet.  I thought Emma Thompson was a revelation as Lady Marchmain, she nailed her part, as did the equally fantastic Gambon as her wayward husband Lord Marchmain, he does more with the flick of an eyebrow then most can do with ten minutes of lines.  Castle Howard is perfect as the main character Brideshead, the grand old house is exquisite.  Much will be made of the gay angle and whether this was Waughs intention for Sabastian, I for one have read the book and I think it's obvious, I liked how the screenwriter made it a true love triangle, but unfortunitely the actor who played Charles had neither chemistry with Sabastian nor his sister Julia.  Charles' last meeting with Sabastian should have been powerful, but it was one sided and all i could think of was, for God sake hug this guy at least.  I do recommend this film, if for no other reason than it is a beautiful piece of film work and really this is an impossible novel to condense into two and a half hours..nice try, boys, but you should have worked harder casting around for your Charles.",4,WAUGH'S BRIDESHEAD,1231632000,"01 11, 2009",2009,2250,"['Let', 'say', 'straight', 'away', 'film', 'sets', 'period', 'wardrobe', 'film', 'are', 'spectacular', 'Brideshead', 'Revisted', 'course', 'one', 'most', 'famous', 'novels', 'British', 'Literature', 'word', 'classic', 'so', 'many', 'were', 'nervous', 'when', 'was', 'announced', 'film', 'was', 'made', 'Brideshead', 'was', 'made', 'miniseries', 'British', 'T.V', 'many', 'years', 'ago', 'was', 'resounding', 'success', 'was', '13', 'hours', 'something', 'film', 'was', 'going', 'have', 'be', 'condenced', 'little', 'two', 'hours', 'film', 'present', 'back', 'telling', 'story', 'how', 'protagonist', 'Charles', 'reached', 'point', 'most', 'part', 'liked', 'how', 'film', 'was', 'structured', 'actor', 'who', 'played', 'Sabastian', 'was', 'fantanstic', 'only', 'wish', 'actor', 'who', 'played', 'Charles', 'had', 'been', 'up', 'standards', 'really', 'what', 'film', 'most', 'never', 'really', 'understand', 'Charles', 'motives', 'really', 'never', 'much', 'least', 'didnt', 'early', 'scenes', 'Oxford', 'too', 'old', 'be', 'playing', 'undergrad', 'never', 'understood', 'Sabastians', 'interest', 'Charles', 'seemed', 'so', 'bland', 'not', 'least', 'bit', 'witty', 'cleaver', 'two', 'things', 'somebody', 'Sabastian', 'would', 'covet', 'thought', 'Emma', 'Thompson', 'was', 'revelation', 'Lady', 'Marchmain', 'nailed', 'part', 'did', 'equally', 'fantastic', 'Gambon', 'wayward', 'husband', 'Lord', 'Marchmain', 'more', 'flick', 'eyebrow', 'then', 'most', 'can', 'do', 'ten', 'minutes', 'lines', 'Castle', 'Howard', 'perfect', 'main', 'character', 'Brideshead', 'grand', 'old', 'house', 'exquisite', 'Much', 'will', 'be', 'made', 'gay', 'angle', 'was', 'Waughs', 'intention', 'Sabastian', 'one', 'have', 'read', 'book', 'think', 'obvious', 'liked', 'how', 'screenwriter', 'made', 'true', 'love', 'triangle', 'unfortunitely', 'actor', 'who', 'played', 'Charles', 'had', 'chemistry', 'Sabastian', 'sister', 'Julia', 'Charles', 'last', 'meeting', 'Sabastian', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'powerful', 'was', 'one', 'sided', 'i', 'could', 'think', 'was', 'God', 'sake', 'hug', 'guy', 'least', 'do', 'recommend', 'film', 'other', 'reason', 'beautiful', 'piece', 'film', 'work', 'really', 'impossible', 'novel', 'condense', 'two', 'half', 'hours..nice', 'try', 'boys', 'should', 'have', 'worked', 'harder', 'casting', 'Charles']",Brideshead Revisited

After a while one suspected all involved looked at the perfection of the internationally acclaimed Made-for-TV series - and proceeded to do the opposite.So by way of apologizing for the depths to which these British filmmakers sank this is my review written for and posted on Amazon UK ...This entire British crew - especially scriptwriters Andrew Davies and Jeremy Brock are to be congratulated for their courage in making so many judicious alterations and omissions to help modern audiences comprehend what Waugh really meant to say in his much-loved but unusually loquacious novel ""Brideshead Revisited"".Their most important improvement being to use a montage of flashbacks to let everyone know this was going to be a wholesome love story.  And to erase any possible confusion cast an anemic actor as the ""arrestingly beautiful"" Sebastian thereby eliminating any sexual ambiguities in Waugh's first four chapters when Charles and Sebastian are obsessed with each other and Julia treats his ""chum"" with undisguised contempt.Despite the limited time at their disposal the 2 scriptwriters ingeniously fabricated 9 scenes (from their imagination) to spruce-up Waugh's carefully constructed meandering storyline which confined Charles and Julia's maudlin romance to the last quarter of the novel.But very soon the only fun to be had watching this appalling adaptation came from spotting every non-Waugh moment.  This is my checklist from one viewing.  Amazon reader may have noted many more.1)Conversation at Sebastian's get-together when Charles sensitively explains what it means to be an artist before he knew he might become one.2)Julia doesn't return to London - but accompanies the boys to Venice to gambol in the sand.3)Julia and Charles are irresistibly attracted after a Venetian Carnival scene (not in the book). Sebastian instantly becomes a dipsomaniac.4)Lady Marchmain invites Charles to witness the Flytes pray in their RC chapel.5)Fictitious 21st Birthday Party for Julia - with obligatory elegant dance scene where everyone chats.6)Lady Marchmain drives to Paddington for a one-on-one with Charles.7)Charles becomes extremely macho - twice promising to ""fix"" Rex.8)Julia overhears Charles purchasing her from Rex in exchange for 2 pictures- causing heartbreak on account of his putting such a cheap price on her head.9)Dramatic moment when the happy pair's departure for wedded bliss is forestalled by the sudden return of Lord Marchmain to die in England - almost instantaneously.I'm sure all those involved have reasonable explanations as to why 20 minutes of spurious scenes were added while 4 important characters - Mr. Samgrass. Anthony Blanche, Rex Mottram and Cordelia were reduced to ciphers.  And why the audience was left in the dark as to the fate and location of the 3 Flyte children.  Perhaps a sequel is in the works?  No bets are off after the creativity of ""Becoming Jane"".Speaking of Julian Jarrold it seems the challenge of recreating a novel which many consider one of the masterpieces of 20th century English literature turned-out to be a creative burden.  Or was it the folk at Buena Vista who asked him to mangle Waugh's plot?  But surely he alone instructed Emma Thomson to play Lady Marchmain as a malicious ""head-matron"" rather than the ""flirtatious and feminine"" mother Waugh describes?  One wonders too why he cast an actor resembling a permanently drunk farm labourer as a noble English aristocrat?The more important question is how much longer can the British film industry survive if it continues to milk English history and allow second-rate writers to eliminate the last vestiges of English cinematic pride with implausible fabricated period junk every time a Hollywood Production Company requests just one more embarrassing dip into our literary well?",5,WAUGH'S GREAT NOVEL FINALLY DONE JUSTICE ON THE BIG SCREEN,1281398400,"08 10, 2010",2010,4269,"['doubly', 'ironic', 'being',

1198866,A4UKBG3M5U5TI,B001GXQSWE,Westley,"[5, 10]","Londoner Charles Ryder (Matthew Goode) arrives at Oxford College and meets a fellow student, Lord Sebastian Flyte, when the good man sticks his head through Ryder's dorm window and vomits.  To make up for this horrible faux pas, Sebastian invites Ryder to lunch with his friends.  The plebian Ryder is awed by the aristocratic Sebastian and is amazed when the Lord seeks out his friendship.  He even takes Ryder to see his family's sprawling country house, Brideshead, although he refuses to allow Ryder to meet his family.  Things change in several during the summer at Brideshead.  First, Sebastian's heretofore somewhat veiled romantic feelings toward Ryder come front and center with a kiss.  Second, Ryder gains a glimpse into the family's inner workings - Flyte's mother, Lady Marchmain (Emma Thompson) maintains an iron fisted rule over her children through staunch Catholicism.  When Ryder develops feelings for Flyte's sister, Julie (Hayley Atwell), Sebastian is devastated and terminates his relationship with Ryder.  However, Ryder is far from done with this family or Brideshead.""Brideshead Revisited"" is one of Evelyn Waugh's undisputed masterpieces.  I've read seven of Waugh's novels, and this film adaptation nearly captures his satirical wit.  Some of the dialogue is very witty, and Emma Thompson is superb in her supporting role.  Even bedecked in a silver wig, she brings sexiness and humor to her icy role.  The film also makes an interesting choice by depicting the relationship between Sebastian and Ryder as more overtly romantic than it is in the novel or miniseries.  In addition, the scenes at Brideshead were filmed beautifully by director Julian Jarrold (Kinky Boots & Becoming Jane), with on location shots at Castle Howard.  Unfortunately, the rest of ""Brideshead Revisited"" is rather bland, aside from the spectacular scenery and costumes.The book is a long, detailed one; indeed, the successful British miniseries from 1981 was 11 hours long.  The film would have benefitted from focusing more on certain aspects of the book instead of trying to cram in so much.  Instead, we get a mishmash of themes and plots, with none given full justice.  In addition, the strong characterizations from Emma Thompson and Ben Whishaw in the early part of the film help carry it through some rough patches.  When these characters disappear in the later part of ""Brideshead Revisited"" and the film focuses on the rather vapid Julia and Ryder, it falls flat.  Ryder is meant to be somewhat of a cipher; he serves as a microscope through which we see the family, as we gradually come to realize that he may be an opportunist.  However, Julia should have been made far more interesting; instead, she just seems randomly erratic.  I wanted to love ""Brideshead Revisited"" and hoped that it would spark a renewed interest in Waugh's works.  This movie, though, seems unlikely to do so.",3,Just visiting,1232236800,"01 18, 2009",2009,2896,"['Londoner', 'Charles', 'Ryder', 'Matthew', 'Goode', 'Oxford', 'College', 'fellow', 'student', 'Lord', 'Sebastian', 'Flyte', 'when', 'good', 'man', 'head', 'Ryder', 'dorm', 'window', 'vomits', 'make', 'up', 'horrible', 'faux', 'pas', 'Sebastian', 'Ryder', 'lunch', 'friends', 'plebian', 'Ryder', 'awed', 'aristocratic', 'Sebastian', 'amazed', 'when', 'Lord', 'out', 'friendship', 'even', 'Ryder', 'see', 'family', 'sprawling', 'country', 'house', 'Brideshead', 'allow', 'Ryder', 'meet', 'family', 'Things', 'change', 'several', 'summer', 'Brideshead', 'First', 'Sebastian', 'heretofore', 'somewhat', 'veiled', 'romantic', 'feelings', 'Ryder', 'come', 'front', 'center', 'kiss', 'Second', 'Ryder', 'gains', 'glimpse', 'family', 'inner', 'workings', 'Flyte', 'mother', 'Lady', 'Marchmain', 'Emma', 'Thompson', 'iron', 'fisted', 'rule', 'children', 'staunch', 'Catholicism', 'When', 'Ryder', 'feelings', 'Flyte', 'sister', 'Julie', 'Hayley', 'Atwell', 'Sebastian', 'devastated', 'relationship', 'Ryder', 'However', 'Ryder', 'far', 'done', 'family', 'Brideshead', 'Brideshead', 'Revisited', 'one', 'Evelyn', 'Waugh', 'undisputed', 'masterpieces', ""'ve"", 'read', 'seven', 'Waugh', 'novels', 'film', 'adaptation', 'nearly', 'satirical', 'wit', 'dialogue', 'very', 'witty', 'Emma', 'Thompson', 'superb', 'supporting', 'role', 'Even', 'bedecked', 'silver', 'wig', 'sexiness', 'humor', 'icy', 'role', 'film', 'also', 'interesting', 'choice', 'depicting', 'relationship', 'Sebastian', 'Ryder', 'more', 'overtly', 'romantic', 'novel', 'miniseries', 'addition', 'scenes', 'Brideshead', 'were', 'filmed', 'beautifully', 'director', 'Julian', 'Jarrold', 'Kinky', 'Boots', 'Becoming', 'Jane', 'location', 'shots', 'Castle', 'Howard', 'Unfortunately', 'rest', 'Brideshead', 'Revisited', 'rather', 'bland', 'aside', 'spectacular', 'scenery', 'costumes.The', 'book', 'long', 'detailed', 'one', 'indeed', 'successful', 'British', 'miniseries', '1981', 'was', '11', 'hours', 'long', 'film', 'would', 'have', 'benefitted', 'focusing', 'more', 'certain', 'aspects', 'book', 'instead', 'trying', 'cram', 'so', 'much', 'Instead', 'get', 'mishmash', 'themes', 'plots', 'none', 'given', 'full', 'justice', 'addition', 'strong', 'characterizations', 'Emma', 'Thompson', 'Ben', 'Whishaw', 'early', 'part', 'film', 'help', 'carry', 'rough', 'patches', 'When', 'characters', 'disappear', 'later', 'part', 'Brideshead', 'Revisited', 'film', 'rather', 'vapid', 'Julia', 'Ryder', 'flat', 'Ryder', 'meant', 'be', 'somewhat', 'cipher', 'microscope', 'see', 'family', 'gradually', 'come', 'realize', 'may', 'be', 'opportunist', 'However', 'Julia', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'made', 'far', 'more', 'interesting', 'instead', 'just', 'randomly', 'erratic', 'wanted', 'love', 'Brideshead', 'Revisited', 'hoped', 'would', 'spark', 'renewed', 'interest', 'Waugh', 'works', 'movie', 'though', 'unlikely', 'do', 'so']",Brideshead Revisited

The substance of the book has been eviscerated.

1198868,A1POFVVXUZR3IQ,B001GXQSWE,Z Hayes,"[5, 8]","I am an ardent fan of the 1982 PBS 11-hour series ""Brideshead Revisited"", and was eager to watch this movie adaptation. Well, after viewing it, I found it hard to compare the two, because the PBS series had the luxury of time to tell the story of Charles, Sebastian and Julia [11 hours altogether] and could thus remain faithful to the novel by Evelyn Waugh. In contrast, the movie version is about 2 hrs in length and thus we end up with a sort of condensed version of the book.That being said, the screenplay by Jeremy Brock [The Last King of Scotland] and Andrew Davies [Pride and Prejudice] retains the original flavor of Waugh's novel, whilst ably condensing the many events portrayed in the book. Matthew Goode plays Charles Ryder,a middle-class young man who is admitted into Oxford. He is an atheist, and has a very cool relationship with his distant father. In Oxford, Charles meets the eccentric Lord Sebastian Flyte [Ben Whishaw] and their first meeting is quite memorable [Sebastian vomits through Charles window]. The inauspicious meeting soon turns into a close friendship [their gestures with each other suggest something more, though consummation is never portrayed].But then Sebastian brings Charles to his ancestral home, the magnificent Brideshead [Castle Howard in all its glory]and Charles is seduced by its' beauty and all that it represents. Charles then meets Julia [Hayley Atwell], Sebastian's sister [who bears an uncanny resemblance to Sebastian] and finds himself beguiled by her. This does not sit well with Sebastian who wants Charles to himself and added to all this is the ever-present 'menace' in the form of the domineering family matriarch, Lady Marchmain [Emma Thompson], an almost fanatical Catholic who controls her children like a master puppeteer. The stress of 'losing' Charles to his sister and his mother's controlling behavior sends Sebastian into a downward spiral. Even Charles isn't spared, as Lady Marchmain cooly informs him that it is not so much his lack of station in society that makes him an unsuitable match for Julia, but rather his not being a Catholic.And there you have it - the two strands that bind the movie together - the notion of lost love and the conflicts posed by religion, i.e. the Catholic faith. The movie presents a rather gloomy view of Catholicism, portraying it as a suppressing force. I felt this was portrayed even more compellingly that it was in the novel.As for the casting, I felt all the lead actors did an excellent job. i would say Matthew Goode and Ben Whishaw did an admirable job in their roles and were just as compelling as their predecessors in the 1982 series. But, the outstanding performance was certainly Emma Thompson's Lady Marchmain which I felt was better than the actress who played her in the PBS series. Thompson's Lady Marchmain is cool and manipulative to such an extent that she comes across as almost monstrous.The cinematography is breathtaking with scenic shots of England, Venice and Morocco. The attention to period details like the luscious costumes  is commendable, making this a gorgeous period drama that will delight fans of the genre.",4,A period drama about love lost and conflict of faith,1233187200,"01 29, 2009",2009,3149,"['am', 'ardent', 'fan', '1982', 'PBS', '11-hour', 'series', 'Brideshead', 'Revisited', 'was', 'eager', 'watch', 'movie', 'adaptation', 'Well', 'viewing', 'found', 'hard', 'compare', 'two', 'PBS', 'series', 'had', 'luxury', 'time', 'tell', 'story', 'Charles', 'Sebastian', 'Julia', '[', '11', 'hours', 'altogether', ']', 'could', 'thus', 'remain', 'faithful', 'novel', 'Evelyn', 'Waugh', 'contrast', 'movie', 'version', '2', 'hrs', 'length', 'thus', 'end', 'up', 'sort', 'condensed', 'version', 'book.That', 'being', 'said', 'screenplay', 'Jeremy', 'Brock', '[', 'Last', 'King', 'Scotland', ']', 'Andrew', 'Davies', '[', 'Pride', 'Prejudice', ']', 'original', 'flavor', 'Waugh', 'novel', 'whilst', 'ably', 'condensing', 'many', 'events', 'portrayed', 'book', 'Matthew', 'Goode', 'Charles', 'Ryder', 'middle-class', 'young', 'man', 'who', 'admitted', 'Oxford', 'atheist', 'very', 'cool', 'relationship', 'distant', 'father', 'Oxford', 'Charles', 'eccentric', 'Lord', 'Sebastian', 'Flyte', '[', 'Ben', 'Whishaw', ']', 'first', 'meeting', 'quite', 'memorable', '[', 'Sebastian', 'vomits', 'Charles', 'window', ']', 'inauspicious', 'meeting', 'soon', 'close', 'friendship', '[', 'gestures', 'other', 'suggest', 'something', 'more', 'consummation', 'never', 'portrayed', ']', '.But', 'then', 'Sebastian', 'brings', 'Charles', 'ancestral', 'home', 'magnificent', 'Brideshead', '[', 'Castle', 'Howard', 'glory', ']', 'Charles', 'seduced', 'beauty', 'Charles', 'then', 'Julia', '[', 'Hayley', 'Atwell', ']', 'Sebastian', 'sister', '[', 'who', 'uncanny', 'resemblance', 'Sebastian', ']', 'beguiled', 'not', 'sit', 'well', 'Sebastian', 'who', 'Charles', 'added', 'ever-present', ""'menace"", 'form', 'domineering', 'family', 'matriarch', 'Lady', 'Marchmain', '[', 'Emma', 'Thompson', ']', 'almost', 'fanatical', 'Catholic', 'who', 'children', 'master', 'puppeteer', 'stress', ""'losing"", 'Charles', 'sister', 'mother', 'controlling', 'behavior', 'sends', 'Sebastian', 'downward', 'spiral', 'Even', 'Charles', ""n't"", 'spared', 'Lady', 'Marchmain', 'cooly', 'not', 'so', 'much', 'lack', 'station', 'society', 'unsuitable', 'match', 'Julia', 'rather', 'not', 'being', 'Catholic.And', 'have', 'two', 'strands', 'bind', 'movie', 'together', 'notion', 'lost', 'love', 'conflicts', 'posed', 'religion', 'i.e', 'Catholic', 'faith', 'movie', 'rather', 'gloomy', 'view', 'Catholicism', 'portraying', 'suppressing', 'force', 'felt', 'was', 'portrayed', 'even', 'more', 'compellingly', 'was', 'novel.As', 'casting', 'felt', 'lead', 'actors', 'did', 'excellent', 'job', 'i', 'would', 'say', 'Matthew', 'Goode', 'Ben', 'Whishaw', 'did', 'admirable', 'job', 'roles', 'were', 'just', 'as', 'compelling', 'predecessors', '1982', 'series', 'outstanding', 'performance', 'was', 'certainly', 'Emma', 'Thompson', 'Lady', 'Marchmain', 'felt', 'was', 'better', 'actress', 'who', 'played', 'PBS', 'series', 'Thompson', 'Lady', 'Marchmain', 'cool', 'manipulative', 'extent', 'almost', 'monstrous.The', 'cinematography', 'breathtaking', 'scenic', 'shots', 'England', 'Venice', 'Morocco', 'attention', 'period', 'details', 'luscious', 'costumes', 'commendable', 'making', 'gorgeous', 'period', 'drama', 'will', 'delight', 'fans', 'genre']",Brideshead Revisited
