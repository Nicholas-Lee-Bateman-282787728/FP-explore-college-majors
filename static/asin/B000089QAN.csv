Button,"[0, 0]","The first time I put in this video I was a little concerned that I wouldn't be able to learn the poses, but after the second time I was surprised how much better I was.I almost have all the quick fix DVDs and each one is fantastic. With 2 young kids and a business out of my home, I don't have a lot of time to spare and the quick fix videos give a good energizing workout in a small amount of time.This is not a relaxing yoga dvd. It's vigorous enough that you build a good sweat (I always have to turn down the heat and open a window), but if you are a bit flexibility challenged (like me) then you can follow the modified version and Joy gives good hints throughout. Easy to follow her through the DVD and once you get the hang of the poses, you can just listen for joys audio cues and not look at the screen.I always feel very energized after this workout and highly recommend the quick fix series for those people that want a good quality workout in 3 10 minute segments. Sometimes I do one 10 minute segment, tend to the kids and then go back for the other two.",5,Love this whole series,1228435200,"12 5, 2008",2008,1067,"['first', 'time', 'put', 'video', 'was', 'little', 'concerned', 'would', ""n't"", 'be', 'able', 'learn', 'poses', 'second', 'time', 'was', 'surprised', 'how', 'much', 'better', 'was.I', 'almost', 'have', 'quick', 'fix', 'DVDs', 'one', 'fantastic', '2', 'young', 'kids', 'business', 'home', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'lot', 'time', 'spare', 'quick', 'fix', 'videos', 'give', 'good', 'energizing', 'workout', 'small', 'amount', 'time.This', 'not', 'relaxing', 'yoga', 'dvd', 'vigorous', 'enough', 'build', 'good', 'sweat', 'always', 'have', 'turn', 'down', 'heat', 'open', 'window', 'are', 'bit', 'flexibility', 'challenged', 'then', 'can', 'follow', 'modified', 'version', 'Joy', 'good', 'hints', 'Easy', 'follow', 'DVD', 'once', 'get', 'hang', 'poses', 'can', 'just', 'listen', 'joys', 'audio', 'cues', 'not', 'look', 'screen.I', 'always', 'feel', 'very', 'energized', 'workout', 'highly', 'recommend', 'quick', 'fix', 'series', 'people', 'want', 'good', 'quality', 'workout', '3', '10', 'minute', 'segments', 'Sometimes', 'do', 'one', '10', 'minute', 'segment', 'tend', 'kids', 'then', 'go', 'back', 'other', 'two']",Quick Fix - Power Yoga Workout

If you do not know your base Yoga moves and the flows between moves you could do more damage than good (IMHO).For those who are Intermediate to advanced you will enjoy this practice very much.

736784,A2KW2XGFYJU4VE,B000089QAN,"Shelley K. Gilbertson ""ssgilby""","[7, 7]","I consider myself a moderately advanced cardio exerciser, and I do practice yoga (particularly power yoga) regularly, and I was really working to keep up with this work out!  Joy moves very quickly, and although she gives some reminders on form and position, one must have familiarity with yoga poses in order to attempt to keep up.  This is definitely fast-flowing yoga - no pose is held for more than a couple of seconds, and you will be working to keep your breath even.  If you are looking for a relaxing, mostly stretching yoga practice, this one isn't for you! If you want to get moving and wake yourself up, then you'll love it!  If you do all three sections, you will definitely get a moderate cardio workout.  Although I wasn't crazy about this workout (I much prefer Bryan Kest, particularly his Power series), I will keep it.  It will be terrific when I am short on time but want to get the breath flowing and the blood pumping!",4,Moves Fast - Not for the Yoga Novice or the Cardio Light Weight!,1141084800,"02 28, 2006",2006,939,"['consider', 'moderately', 'advanced', 'cardio', 'exerciser', 'do', 'practice', 'yoga', 'particularly', 'power', 'yoga', 'regularly', 'was', 'really', 'working', 'keep', 'up', 'work', 'out', 'Joy', 'very', 'quickly', 'reminders', 'form', 'position', 'one', 'must', 'have', 'familiarity', 'yoga', 'poses', 'order', 'attempt', 'keep', 'up', 'definitely', 'fast-flowing', 'yoga', 'pose', 'held', 'more', 'couple', 'seconds', 'will', 'be', 'working', 'keep', 'breath', 'even', 'are', 'looking', 'relaxing', 'mostly', 'stretching', 'yoga', 'practice', 'one', ""n't"", 'want', 'get', 'moving', 'wake', 'up', 'then', ""'ll"", 'love', 'do', 'three', 'sections', 'will', 'definitely', 'get', 'moderate', 'cardio', 'workout', 'was', ""n't"", 'crazy', 'workout', 'much', 'prefer', 'Bryan', 'Kest', 'particularly', 'Power', 'series', 'will', 'keep', 'will', 'be', 'terrific', 'when', 'am', 'short', 'time', 'want', 'get', 'breath', 'flowing', 'blood', 'pumping']",Quick Fix - Power Yoga Workout
