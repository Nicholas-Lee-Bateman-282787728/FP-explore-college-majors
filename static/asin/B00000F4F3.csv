Heather Locklear should not have played the title role.  She is too old and had far too much plastic surgery.  She just bother the holy crap out of me.The acting left much to be desired as well.  It was almost as if every actor on the screen mentally told themselves: ""Hey! This is for Lifetime, let's do a half a** job.  We still get paid whether the movie is crap or not.""Also, I think that the editing was entirely shoddy.

In fact it is only about 95 minutes long, which will make it a good TV movie.The sets in this movie and the scenery are the greatest asset to this film. The plot, was a bit too contrived, this irritated me. Why on the said morning of a murder, just come to town, Reece (Heather Locklear) would be the only person on hand to witness this event?It is at that point her disturbed past is revealed and questions arise concerning her mental state. Feeble attempts are made to project some misdirection, but the real bad guy is just too obvious.As a sub-plot, the residents of the community seem very pre-occupied with getting into the ladies' pants, and three mild sex scenes are thrown in to try to add some spice the film.Overall, this film is just OK, and nothing here really to rave about.",3,Beautiful Scenery but plot too Contrived,1318896000,"10 18, 2011",2011,926,"['Ok', 'first', 'off', 'order', 'not', 'be', 'too', 'disappointed', 'must', 'realize', 'not', 'typical', 'big', 'budget', 'full', 'length', 'Hollywood', 'movie', 'fact', 'only', 'about', '95', 'minutes', 'long', 'will', 'make', 'good', 'TV', 'movie.The', 'sets', 'movie', 'scenery', 'are', 'greatest', 'asset', 'film', 'plot', 'was', 'bit', 'too', 'contrived', 'irritated', 'Why', 'said', 'morning', 'murder', 'just', 'come', 'town', 'Reece', 'Heather', 'Locklear', 'would', 'be', 'only', 'person', 'hand', 'witness', 'event', 'point', 'disturbed', 'past', 'revealed', 'questions', 'arise', 'concerning', 'mental', 'state', 'Feeble', 'attempts', 'are', 'made', 'project', 'misdirection', 'real', 'bad', 'guy', 'just', 'too', 'obvious.As', 'sub-plot', 'residents', 'community', 'seem', 'very', 'pre-occupied', 'getting', 'ladies', 'pants', 'three', 'mild', 'sex', 'scenes', 'are', 'thrown', 'try', 'add', 'spice', 'film.Overall', 'film', 'just', 'OK', 'nothing', 'here', 'really', 'rave', 'about']",Angels Fall

498359,AYAADU8AAMME2,B00000F4F3,"ManningGal ""TnBFan4LIFE""","[1, 2]","What a disappointment! I remember when I first heard that Nora Roberts was emulating Danielle Steel and allowing some of her books to be developed into TV movies, I was so anxious to see the end results. I am a lifelong D. Steel  fan & have virtually every novel and TV movie she has made. I like Nora Roberts' work as well, but admittedly, I am a sucker for the TV movie romance genre (Thanking the ""TV Gods"" for Lifetime and Lifetime & Hallmark Movie Channels as we speak!!). The Steel adaptations have been so good & well-acted by and large, so I was also very hopeful for N. Roberts' works. Well, wishful thinking can only take you so far!!!This movie was a dud in every sense of the word. The plot was scattered and nonsensical, the acting was horrific, the romance fizzled, and the dialogue was a crime against humanity!!! I kept wondering what kind of a bet Heather Locklear must have lost for her to agree to be part of this mess. Heather Locklear--the TV darling who has created such memorable characters & wowed audiences with her impressive acting range from drama to comedy and back again over the years--presents such an unlikeable & confusing character in this movie. Instead of Locklear's patent vixen, love to hate characters or her female heroines with heart & humor, we have a traumatized former chef suffering the apparent affects of PTSD, who might be the victim of a gaslighting OR who might be a murderess in disguise. Bottom line: You won't care!!! At least I didn't. The story bounces all over the place and the plot is way too convoluted. And, the so-called romance between Locklear's Reece & Johnathon Schaech's brooding Brody was so dull it was almost painful to watch at times...Much like the movie itself!!

Alcat ""Curiosity killed the cat, but sa...","[12, 14]","""Angel's Fall"", based on a book written by Nora Roberts, is an engaging movie that is likely to entertain you, and that has enough ingredients of a good thriller to keep you at the edge of your seat.The main character is Reece (Heather Locklear), a young woman that survived a massacre in her Boston restaurant and has been running from what happened, never settling too long anywhere. Despite that, she decides to settle at least for a little while in a small but very beautiful Wyoming town, Angel's Falls. Reece gets a job at a diner, manages to make some new friend and even meets Brody (Johnathon Schaech), a handsome writer she is somewhat attracted to, even though he irritates her. Unfortunately, Reece's luck doesn't hold, and she ends up witnessing from afar what seems to be a murder. But did Reece really saw a crime, or is she so traumatized by what happened to her in Boston that she is imagining things?If you are interested in knowing what happened and how things develop between Reece and Brody, simply watch this movie. Truth to be told, it is different from the book on which it is based, but nonetheless good enough on its own to be worth watching. That is the reason why I give this movie 3.5 stars out of 5.
