For some reason, this gem is often overlooked. This show featured a great cast of veteran TV stars including Suzanne Somers (Three's Company), Patrick Duffy (Dallas), Sasha Mitchell (Also, Dallas), and Bronson Pinchot (Perfect Strangers).The show focused on a Brady-Bunch type blended family. The kids ranged in ages from infant to college-age, and the parents had lots of screen time, so everyone can relate to someone. A great show for families.

979082,A2TVMOHHS0CF0T,B000EU1QC2,L. Taylor,"[7, 8]","I recently purchased this DVD to help contribute to the production of DVD boxed season sets, and if you REALLY want to see the boxed season sets go into production, then please, don't hesitate to buy this DVD. It's only 5 bucks LOL!With that having been said, I would like to add a few comments about this show. First, I grew up watching this show on TV, and even into my teen-age years I still watched it. I'm 24 years of age now, and this show still holds one of those ""sentimental-type"" places with me. Despite what many critics have said in the past, this show was truly one of the better shows I've watched on TV.The show ended back in 1998 after stooping to the lowest ratings it ever recieved in it's 7 season run. Personally, I feel this was due to multiple factors. IMHO, The main factor for the loss in ratings was due to the loss of Cody (Sasha Mitchel, the actor who played Cody ran into some domestic legal problems with his wife, and as a result Disney canceled his character). Without him, the show lost much of what made it comical, and fun to watch. Sure, each character was funny and entertaining in their own way, but it's clear to anyone has seen more than a few episodes of this show that Cody was often the center of the comedy. All the other characters seemed to interact with him to bring life to the script. I feel the producers must of realized this, for they brought Cody back for the next to last episode of the series in season 7, but by then it was too late.To compensate for the loss of Cody the producers tried to introduce other characters to take Cody's place, such as Flash and JT's best friend Rich (Jason Marsden). While I feel Flash was somewhat cool (especially in the two episodes where the family went to Disney World, and Flash captured the tourist record for USA), still, Flash was certaintly no Cody. The same can be said of Rich, though I feel Rich's character became a positive contribution when he began dating Dana, as it was a pure example of ""opposites attract"", and no one really seen it comming.Another major reason for the loss of ratings is the actors, as well as the characters they played did what all kids do........they got older! Remember, when the show first began JT and Dana weren't but about 15-16 years of age and Karen was 14. When the show ended all three of these characters were in their 20's. Let's not forget the character Al (Christine Lakin) was only 11 years old when the show began, but was either 18 or 19 when the show ended. Thus, these kids were no longer kids and teen-agers, but were adults at the end of the series. Thats not to say that they were any less entertaining, just the magic that comes from a mom and dad raising their kids was pretty much over. I think this is probably why Brenden's character was phased out, and Lilly's character was added, as the producers were trying to recapture the concept of Carol and Frank being a mom and dad, and trying to raise a family.One other minor factor for the show's cancelation could be due to the movement of the series from ABC's TGIF line-up to CBS. Remember, it was common for most fans of TGIF to watch all four shows (whatever 4 were on the air at any given time) straight through, and since Step By Step was no longer on the station some people probably didn't bother changing their TV channel during the 2 hour TGIF block, and left their TV's tuned to ABC rather than tuning into CBS.One final point I would like to note is this: For some odd reason most of the actors and actresses have had next to zero acting careers since this series ended. I'm not exactly sure why this is, but I've always suspicioned this series had something to do with it. From what I've read in online searches it appears the actor Brandon Call (JT Lambert) retired from acting after the series ended, and now owns his own gas station and car wash somewhere in California. It also appears that Christopher Castle (Mark Foster) and Josh Byrne (Brended Lambert) haven't done anything else in the acting buisness since this series ended as well. Even Angela Watson (Karen Foster) hasn't done much acting either, though she has been working for a company that helps prevent child actors from being used for money by their parents.Perhaps in the future someone will do a documentary, and interview the actors and actresses who appeared on this show to see what everyone has been up to since the series ended. Maybe higher sales of this DVD will provoke someone to do it LOL!",4,A TGIF Classic.,1171756800,"02 18, 2007",2007,4484,"['recently', 'purchased', 'DVD', 'help', 'contribute', 'production', 'DVD', 'boxed', 'season', 'sets', 'REALLY', 'want', 'see', 'boxed', 'season', 'sets', 'go', 'production', 'then', 'please', 'do', ""n't"", 'hesitate', 'buy', 'DVD', 'only', '5', 'bucks', 'LOL', 'having', 'been', 'said', 'would', 'like', 'add', 'few', 'comments', 'show', 'First', 'grew', 'up', 'watching', 'show', 'TV', 'even', 'teen-age', 'years', 'still', 'watched', ""'m"", '24', 'years', 'age', 'now', 'show', 'still', 'one', 'sentimental-type', 'places', 'what', 'many', 'critics', 'have', 'said', 'past', 'show', 'was', 'truly', 'one', 'better', 'shows', ""'ve"", 'watched', 'TV.The', 'show', 'ended', 'back', '1998', 'stooping', 'lowest', 'ratings', 'ever', 'recieved', '7', 'season', 'run', 'Personally', 'feel', 'was', 'due', 'multiple', 'factors', 'IMHO', 'main', 'factor', 'loss', 'ratings', 'was', 'due', 'loss', 'Cody', 'Sasha', 'Mitchel', 'actor', 'who', 'played', 'Cody', 'ran', 'domestic', 'legal', 'problems', 'wife', 'result', 'Disney', 'canceled', 'character', 'show', 'lost', 'much', 'what', 'made', 'comical', 'fun', 'watch', 'Sure', 'character', 'was', 'funny', 'entertaining', 'own', 'way', 'clear', 'anyone', 'seen', 'more', 'few', 'episodes', 'show', 'Cody', 'was', 'often', 'center', 'comedy', 'other', 'characters', 'seemed', 'interact', 'bring', 'life', 'script', 'feel', 'producers', 'must', 'realized', 'brought', 'Cody', 'back', 'next', 'last', 'episode', 'series', 'season', '7', 'then', 'was', 'too', 'late.To', 'compensate', 'loss', 'Cody', 'producers', 'tried', 'introduce', 'other', 'characters', 'take', 'Cody', 'place', 'such', 'Flash', 'JT', 'best', 'friend', 'Rich', 'Jason', 'Marsden', 'feel', 'Flash', 'was', 'somewhat', 'cool', 'especially', 'two', 'episodes', 'where', 'family', 'went', 'Disney', 'World', 'Flash', 'captured', 'tourist', 'record', 'USA', 'still', 'Flash', 'was', 'certaintly', 'Cody', 'same', 'can', 'be', 'said', 'Rich', 'feel', 'Rich', 'character', 'became', 'positive', 'contribution', 'when', 'began', 'dating', 'Dana', 'was', 'pure', 'example', 'opposites', 'attract', 'one', 'really', 'seen', 'comming.Another', 'major', 'reason', 'loss', 'ratings', 'actors', 'as', 'well', 'characters', 'played', 'did', 'what', 'kids', 'do', 'got', 'older', 'Remember', 'when', 'show', 'first', 'began', 'JT', 'Dana', 'were', ""n't"", '15-16', 'years', 'age', 'Karen', 'was', '14', 'When', 'show', 'ended', 'three', 'characters', 'were', '20', 'Let', 'not', 'forget', 'character', 'Al', 'Christine', 'Lakin', 'was', 'only', '11', 'years', 'old', 'when', 'show', 'began', 'was', 'either', '18', '19', 'when', 'show', 'ended', 'Thus', 'kids', 'were', 'no', 'longer', 'kids', 'teen-agers', 'were', 'adults', 'end', 'series', 'not', 'say', 'were', 'less', 'entertaining', 'just', 'magic', 'mom', 'dad', 'raising', 'kids', 'was', 'pretty', 'much', 'think', 'probably', 'why', 'Brenden', 'character', 'was', 'phased', 'out', 'Lilly', 'character', 'was', 'added', 'producers', 'were', 'trying', 'recapture', 'concept', 'Carol', 'Frank', 'being', 'mom', 'dad', 'trying', 'raise', 'family.One', 'other', 'minor', 'factor', 'show', 'cancelation', 'could', 'be', 'due', 'movement', 'series', 'ABC', 'TGIF', 'line-up', 'CBS', 'Remember', 'was', 'common', 'most', 'fans', 'TGIF', 'watch', 'four', 'shows', '4', 'were', 'air', 'given', 'time', 'straight', 'Step', 'Step', 'was', 'no', 'longer', 'station', 'people', 'probably', 'did', ""n't"", 'bother', 'changing', 'TV', 'channel', '2', 'hour', 'TGIF', 'block', 'left', 'TV', 'tuned', 'ABC', 'rather', 'tuning', 'CBS.One', 'final', 'point', 'would', 'like', 'note', 'odd', 'reason', 'most', 'actors', 'actresses', 'have', 'had', 'next', 'zero', 'acting', 'careers', 'series', 'ended', ""'m"", 'not', 'exactly', 'sure', 'why', ""'ve"", 'always', 'suspicioned', 'series', 'had', 'something', 'do', 'what', ""'ve"", 'read', 'online', 'searches', 'actor', 'Brandon', 'Call', 'JT', 'Lambert', 'retired', 'acting', 'series', 'ended', 'now', 'own', 'gas', 'station', 'car', 'wash', 'somewhere', 'California', 'also', 'Christopher', 'Castle', 'Mark', 'Foster', 'Josh', 'Byrne', 'Brended', 'Lambert', 'have', ""n't"", 'done', 'anything', 'else', 'acting', 'buisness', 'series', 'ended', 'as', 'well', 'Even', 'Angela', 'Watson', 'Karen', 'Foster', ""n't"", 'done', 'much', 'acting', 'been', 'working', 'company', 'prevent', 'child', 'actors', 'being', 'used', 'money', 'parents.Perhaps', 'future', 'someone', 'will', 'do', 'documentary', 'interview', 'actors', 'actresses', 'who', 'appeared', 'show', 'see', 'what', 'everyone', 'been', 'up', 'series', 'ended', 'Maybe', 'higher', 'sales', 'DVD', 'will', 'provoke', 'someone', 'do', 'LOL']",Step by Step

The only character's attitude I didn't like was Dana becuase she was so stuck up and judgmental, but overall she gave the funniest lines, especially towards JT(ex. Spud the Potato, Greaseball,etc.).
