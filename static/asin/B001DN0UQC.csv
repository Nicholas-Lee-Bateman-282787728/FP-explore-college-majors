Try not to make the same mistake. ;p  This is only two extra episodes essentially, made as spring/summer specials. They stand alone well, but I'm not sure the price was right... at $10-12 they would be worth it without a doubt.

1182266,A1TO1P3NV7OAU6,B001DN0UQC,"KevinB ""The Honey Badger""","[1, 1]","Negi and his girls go on a seaside vacation. After accidentally seeing Asuna naked, Negi is depressed about her being mad at him. The other girls come up with a silly plan to reconcile them. After that, They all go to a spa resort. Nothing important happens. Nodoka spends most of her time wit Negi while the other girls try to get his attention away from her.This special is fun, but that's about it. It's rated TV MA. I think that's overdoing it a bit. It's just a bunch of girls in towels and bathing suits, with an occasional suggestive scene or 2. This should really be TV 14.

1182267,AVXA1TTTPWF7I,B001DN0UQC,Malachi Hachi,"[7, 10]","This collection features the spring and summer specials. Anyone who reads the mangas will recognize the first episode because it animates the time Negi and Asuna have their big fight there where she won't forgive him. Of course a few things are added to it as well since it is using the animation from the second series, like a chupacabra hunt and skydiving. The second episode was something completely new to me, where Nodoka and Negi are stuck together by a red thread and they have to make it through the day. Both episodes a pretty good I'd say, with some great scenes featuring Zazie being awesome, though these episodes rely heavily on the fan service.Comes in a standard 15mm dvd case, trailers, and the audio plays in stereo. It has both the japanese and english dubs, but I wouldn't recommend anyone to watch in the english dub because in my opinion, it is pretty bad.",5,great,1236470400,"03 8, 2009",2009,877,"['collection', 'spring', 'summer', 'specials', 'Anyone', 'who', 'mangas', 'will', 'recognize', 'first', 'episode', 'time', 'Negi', 'Asuna', 'have', 'big', 'fight', 'where', 'wo', ""n't"", 'forgive', 'course', 'few', 'things', 'are', 'added', 'as', 'well', 'using', 'animation', 'second', 'series', 'chupacabra', 'hunt', 'skydiving', 'second', 'episode', 'was', 'something', 'completely', 'new', 'where', 'Nodoka', 'Negi', 'are', 'stuck', 'together', 'red', 'thread', 'have', 'make', 'day', 'pretty', 'good', ""'d"", 'say', 'great', 'scenes', 'featuring', 'Zazie', 'being', 'awesome', 'episodes', 'rely', 'heavily', 'fan', 'standard', '15mm', 'dvd', 'case', 'trailers', 'audio', 'stereo', 'japanese', 'english', 'dubs', 'would', ""n't"", 'recommend', 'anyone', 'watch', 'english', 'dub', 'opinion', 'pretty', 'bad']",Negima!?

While the Second Season wasn't about fan service & focused more on the comedy aspect, this focused a little more towards the fan service BUT it was equally focused on the comedy as well.
