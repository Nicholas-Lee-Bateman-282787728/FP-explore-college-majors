1070323,A1DH3QDZX8Z7GO,B000PE0GXC,Charlemange,"[3, 5]","There are several reviews that discuss the historical accuracy of this film, but my review of Hallmark's made for TV movie, Marco Polo is based mostly on its entertainment value.The sets and costumes were very nice, but the story was very slow paced and became tedious to watch.  Some of the fighting scenes were good and it was interesting to see B.D. Wong (""Pedro"") performing martial arts.Historically, Kublai Khan wished to meet with Marco Polo because he had never seen a European before.  The casting of Brian Dennehy as Kublai Khan was a poor decision.  It's offensive enough seeing a Caucasian actor in an Asian role, but on top of that, his acting was painfully bad.I suppose seeing this movie might get some people interested in reading Marco Polo's book and learning more about that part of history.  Probably more interesting than watching this made for TV movie.",3,"Nice Visuals, But Overall Pretty Boring",1262908800,"01 8, 2010",2010,875,"['are', 'several', 'reviews', 'discuss', 'historical', 'accuracy', 'film', 'review', 'Hallmark', 'made', 'TV', 'movie', 'Marco', 'Polo', 'based', 'mostly', 'entertainment', 'value.The', 'sets', 'costumes', 'were', 'very', 'nice', 'story', 'was', 'very', 'slow', 'paced', 'became', 'tedious', 'watch', 'fighting', 'scenes', 'were', 'good', 'was', 'interesting', 'see', 'B.D', 'Wong', 'Pedro', 'performing', 'martial', 'arts.Historically', 'Kublai', 'Khan', 'wished', 'meet', 'Marco', 'Polo', 'had', 'never', 'seen', 'European', 'before', 'casting', 'Brian', 'Dennehy', 'Kublai', 'Khan', 'was', 'poor', 'decision', 'offensive', 'enough', 'seeing', 'Caucasian', 'actor', 'Asian', 'role', 'top', 'acting', 'was', 'painfully', 'bad.I', 'suppose', 'seeing', 'movie', 'might', 'get', 'people', 'interested', 'reading', 'Marco', 'Polo', 'book', 'learning', 'more', 'part', 'history', 'Probably', 'more', 'interesting', 'watching', 'made', 'TV', 'movie']",Marco Polo

1070328,A1NIS5QFY6KCT7,B000PE0GXC,Mike the Geology Teacher,"[0, 2]","Some of you may remember the old Howard Hughes movie The Congueror. The punchline of that movie is that Hughes chose John Wayne to play Genghis Khan. Of course that was at a time when American film makers routinely picked white actors to play Asians or Native Americans (Peter Lorre playing Mr. Moto and David Carridine playing a Shaolin Buddhist monk) We haven't seen many caucasians cast in Asian roles in the last few years. Marco Polo is about the only exception I can think of. The producers chose beefy ex-rugby player and former Marine BRIAN DENNEHY as Mongolian-Chinese emperor Kubla Khan. Every time Dennehy appeared on screen I thought of John Wayne playing Kubla's grandfather. While Dennehy seems like a bit of a ham fisted choice, he was far more interesting than leading actor Ian Samerholder who managed to breath little life into his role. The backdrops for this movie are beautiful, but the videography (it clearly looks like it was shot on video) was workmanlike but un-inspiring. Marco Polo is a very small interpretation of an epic journey.",2,An Epic Story Made Small,1339804800,"06 16, 2012",2012,1060,"['may', 'remember', 'old', 'Howard', 'Hughes', 'movie', 'Congueror', 'punchline', 'movie', 'Hughes', 'chose', 'John', 'Wayne', 'play', 'Genghis', 'Khan', 'course', 'was', 'time', 'when', 'American', 'film', 'makers', 'routinely', 'picked', 'white', 'actors', 'play', 'Asians', 'Native', 'Americans', 'Peter', 'Lorre', 'playing', 'Mr.', 'Moto', 'David', 'Carridine', 'playing', 'Shaolin', 'Buddhist', 'monk', 'have', ""n't"", 'seen', 'many', 'caucasians', 'cast', 'Asian', 'roles', 'last', 'few', 'years', 'Marco', 'Polo', 'only', 'exception', 'can', 'think', 'producers', 'chose', 'beefy', 'ex-rugby', 'player', 'former', 'Marine', 'BRIAN', 'DENNEHY', 'Mongolian-Chinese', 'emperor', 'Kubla', 'Khan', 'time', 'Dennehy', 'appeared', 'screen', 'thought', 'John', 'Wayne', 'playing', 'Kubla', 'grandfather', 'Dennehy', 'bit', 'ham', 'fisted', 'choice', 'was', 'far', 'more', 'interesting', 'leading', 'actor', 'Ian', 'Samerholder', 'who', 'managed', 'breath', 'little', 'life', 'role', 'backdrops', 'movie', 'are', 'beautiful', 'videography', 'clearly', 'was', 'shot', 'video', 'was', 'workmanlike', 'un-inspiring', 'Marco', 'Polo', 'very', 'small', 'interpretation', 'epic', 'journey']",Marco Polo
