Mr. Cringley relates to us how he was one of the early employees of Apple Computers in the days in which it operated out of a garage. Now a self-proclaimed gossip columnist for the computer world Mr. Cringley guides us through the important steps and missteps that made personal computing the industry it is today.Interviewed are computer giants such as Bill Gates, Steven Jobs and Larry Ellison just to name a few. They along with others relate their stories and the excitement they shared as they built from scratch the phenomenon, which is now the personal computer.

I saw it listed with The Pirates of Silicon Valley and just had to buy it. Better late than never!Wonderful stuff.I love reading and viewing anything I can get my hands on about this lovely Valley I call home. I'm fascinated by stories about these adventurous young nerds/geniuses who spawned the personal computer. The only one of them I truly know is Steve Wozniak and I think he's a genius AND a fine human being, very devoted to children and a generous contributor to the Silicon Valley community.As the director of this video says, The Woz has a wonderful sense of humor. I found that out when I asked him for permission to use him as a character in my novel THE TOONIES INVADE SILICON VALLEY.  So cool of him, and as a result my book is unique among books.And now THE PIRATES OF SILICON VALLEY is out, giving us the serious inside story of what really happened in the early days of personal computers, infighting and all.

The most interesting aspect of watching this today is that it was made just prior to the boom of the Internet. The Internet was in existence, but it was realitively unknown by most people. Windows 95 had not yet been released, and you can watch Steve Ballmer show his excitement for what would turn out to be a huge game changer. You will see the rise and fall of IBM, Apple, and CP/M. The story of IBM and their quest for an O/S to go with a quickly created PC is probably the most memorable thing in the video.

One of the parts that sticks out in my mind is about how the personal computer revolution happened so quickly.  Cringley points out that the personal computer industry was totally different than any other industry.  The participants shared their friendships, work, and knowledge freely.  This ""free sharing of knowledge"" was on of the primary the lynch pin that allowed the industry to explode so quickly.They shared this knowledge because it all started out as a hobby and many hobbyists freely share ideas.  The nerds had no idea of the powder keg of an industry they were sitting on!Cringley points out a second lynch pin was the growth of the industry was partially because of the youth and exuberance of its participants.  For example, he states: ""In the PC business, constant change is the only norm, and adolescent energy is the source of that change.""This is an incredible show for anyone interested in learning about the fascinating story of the start of the PC industry.The Re-Discovery of Common Sense: A Guide to: The Lost Art of Critical Thinking",5,Boys will be Boys!,1213401600,"06 14, 2008",2008,1501,"['Triumph', 'Nerds', 'came', 'book', 'Accidental', 'Empires', 'eye', 'opening', 'documentary', 'personal', 'computer', 'revolution', 'who', 'made', 'happen', 'inside', 'writer', 'who', 'knew', 'individuals.Robert', 'Cringley', 'exceptionally', 'thorough', 'job', 'providing', 'bird', 'eye', 'view', 'personalities', 'motivations', 'business', 'environment', 'savvy', 'nerds', 'who', 'changed', 'world.I', 'thoroughly', 'enjoyed', 'reading', 'entire', 'book', 'One', 'parts', 'out', 'mind', 'how', 'personal', 'computer', 'revolution', 'happened', 'so', 'quickly', 'Cringley', 'points', 'out', 'personal', 'computer', 'industry', 'was', 'totally', 'different', 'other', 'industry', 'participants', 'shared', 'friendships', 'work', 'knowledge', 'freely', 'free', 'sharing', 'knowledge', 'was', 'primary', 'lynch', 'pin', 'allowed', 'industry', 'explode', 'so', 'quickly.They', 'shared', 'knowledge', 'started', 'out', 'hobby', 'many', 'hobbyists', 'freely', 'share', 'ideas', 'nerds', 'had', 'idea', 'powder', 'keg', 'industry', 'were', 'sitting', 'Cringley', 'points', 'out', 'second', 'lynch', 'pin', 'was', 'growth', 'industry', 'was', 'partially', 'youth', 'exuberance', 'participants', 'example', 'PC', 'business', 'constant', 'change', 'only', 'norm', 'adolescent', 'energy', 'source', 'change', 'incredible', 'show', 'anyone', 'interested', 'learning', 'fascinating', 'story', 'start', 'PC', 'Re-Discovery', 'Common', 'Sense', 'Guide', 'Lost', 'Art', 'Critical', 'Thinking']",Triumph of the Nerds Gift Set 3-Pk VHS
405218,A1S3C5OFU508P3,6304170408,Charles Ashbacher,"[20, 21]","This is the most interesting educational videotape that I have ever seen. It irreverently, but accurately, chronicles the rise of the PC as a force in the modern world. Quite naturally, much of the focus is on Steve Jobs, Steve Wozniak, Paul Allen and Bill Gates, as they are the four most widely known individuals in the personal computer field. However, a great deal of time is also spent in explaining the role of others, so that it could be more accurately titled, ""Triumph of Some of the Nerds."" While the actions of Gates, Jobs and gang are important, some of the most significant events are those of others, who missed incredible opportunities.It is astonishing to learn that the program that became MS-DOS was purchased for $50,000 with no residuals. This should become a story to rival the purchase of Manhattan for the fabled $... in beads. Representatives from IBM went to the creator of CPM, which was the best-selling microcomputer operating system at the time. Their goal was to obtain an operating system that could be used in their upcoming line of personal computers. Unbelievably, they were kept waiting and those representatives gave up and went back to Microsoft where theysigned the deal for MS-DOS.The scientists at Xerox Palto Alto Research Center (PARC) created many of the modern principles of computing such as the Graphical User Interface (GUI). Steve Jobs is passionate in his description of his reaction when he saw it for the first time. However, Xerox gained nothing but prestige from their inventions. The last of these stories is that the creators of the spreadsheet receive no royalties at all from their invention.Two very powerful personalities, Steve Jobs and Bill Gates, have been instrumental in taking ideas from others and turning them into billion dollar products. While Gates keeps his intensity under wraps in public, not so with Steve Jobs. Towards the end of the tapes, he describes his feelings towards Microsoft. He does not complain about their business practices, but about their lack of vision and style. From his mannerisms, tone of voice and eye expressions, you see a man who cares deeply about the quality of human-machine interactions. It is a powerful piece of video.This is a tape that should be in every library, from the small-town public to that of the biggest universities. In a few hours, you learn the history of how the personal computer was made personal. Cringely does a superb job in describing events that simply would never have occurred to a writer of fiction. It should be mandatory viewing in all computer science and introduction to business classes.Published in Mathematics and Computer Education, reprinted with permission.",5,The most educational educational tape I have seen.,1010188800,"01 5, 2002",2002,2699,"['most', 'interesting', 'educational', 'videotape', 'have', 'ever', 'seen', 'irreverently', 'accurately', 'rise', 'PC', 'force', 'modern', 'world', 'Quite', 'naturally', 'much', 'focus', 'Steve', 'Jobs', 'Steve', 'Wozniak', 'Paul', 'Allen', 'Bill', 'Gates', 'are', 'four', 'most', 'widely', 'known', 'individuals', 'personal', 'computer', 'field', 'However', 'great', 'deal', 'time', 'also', 'spent', 'explaining', 'role', 'others', 'could', 'be', 'more', 'accurately', 'titled', 'Triumph', 'Nerds', 'actions', 'Gates', 'Jobs', 'gang', 'are', 'important', 'most', 'significant', 'events', 'are', 'others', 'who', 'missed', 'incredible', 'opportunities.It', 'astonishing', 'learn', 'program', 'became', 'MS-DOS', 'was', 'purchased', '50,000', 'residuals', 'should', 'become', 'story', 'rival', 'purchase', 'Manhattan', 'fabled', 'beads', 'Representatives', 'IBM', 'went', 'creator', 'CPM', 'was', 'best-selling', 'microcomputer', 'operating', 'system', 'time', 'goal', 'was', 'obtain', 'operating', 'system', 'could', 'be', 'used', 'upcoming', 'line', 'personal', 'computers', 'Unbelievably', 'were', 'kept', 'waiting', 'representatives', 'gave', 'up', 'went', 'back', 'Microsoft', 'where', 'theysigned', 'deal', 'MS-DOS.The', 'scientists', 'Xerox', 'Palto', 'Alto', 'Research', 'Center', 'PARC', 'created', 'many', 'modern', 'principles', 'computing', 'such', 'Graphical', 'User', 'Interface', 'GUI', 'Steve', 'Jobs', 'passionate', 'description', 'reaction', 'when', 'saw', 'first', 'time', 'However', 'Xerox', 'gained', 'nothing', 'prestige', 'inventions', 'last', 'stories', 'creators', 'spreadsheet', 'receive', 'royalties', 'invention.Two', 'very', 'powerful', 'personalities', 'Steve', 'Jobs', 'Bill', 'Gates', 'have', 'been', 'instrumental', 'taking', 'ideas', 'others', 'turning', 'billion', 'dollar', 'products', 'Gates', 'intensity', 'wraps', 'public', 'not', 'so', 'Steve', 'Jobs', 'end', 'tapes', 'feelings', 'towards', 'Microsoft', 'not', 'complain', 'business', 'practices', 'lack', 'vision', 'style', 'mannerisms', 'tone', 'voice', 'eye', 'expressions', 'see', 'man', 'who', 'deeply', 'quality', 'human-machine', 'interactions', 'powerful', 'piece', 'video.This', 'tape', 'should', 'be', 'library', 'small-town', 'public', 'biggest', 'universities', 'few', 'hours', 'learn', 'history', 'how', 'personal', 'computer', 'was', 'made', 'personal', 'Cringely', 'superb', 'job', 'describing', 'events', 'simply', 'would', 'never', 'have', 'occurred', 'writer', 'fiction', 'should', 'be', 'mandatory', 'viewing', 'computer', 'science', 'introduction', 'business', 'classes.Published', 'Mathematics', 'Computer', 'Education', 'reprinted', 'permission']",Triumph of the Nerds Gift Set 3-Pk VHS

I teach various technology and computer programming courses at the High School level and I thought this would be a good instructional aid in teaching students about the start of the personal computer industry. To further assist the teacher, Ambrose Video provides a good lesson plan outline (on their website) on how to approach the three parts contained within the DVD.Overall, most students found the material presented in this video relevant and interesting. The only thing I would be cautious with is a scene in Volume 1, the ""HOT TUB"" scene.

The interviews with the top CEO's and founders of some of our greatest companies is an interesting insight into the growth of a modern industry. It is also interesting to see how luck played a role, as well as pirating.The viewer will surely come to understand that we are just now in the infancy of computing and that the future is very bright and vast. Investors will also notice this fact and they will observe the market trends to decide where to invest their money to capture future growth.I especially enjoyed the interviews and comments by Steve Wozniak. He contributed some of the most incisive work that allowed computers to come to our desktops. He is a very unassuming man who simply enjoyed his hobby and I got the feeling that he still does.It makes you appreciate the strangers that you see everyday while sitting in a restaurant or driving down the road. Who amongst these strangers are the next Steve Wozniak, or Michael Gates? You come to understand that anyone you see can be a person who contributes the next advancement to mankind and gives one an appreciation of our fellow man.Triumph of the Nerds illustrates beautifully that great minds are to be admired, as much if not more so than the best of our professional athlete's.

Breazeal,"[123, 125]","Triumph of the Nerds is still one of the best public level documentaries about the origins and development of personal computers from their beginnings in the mid-70's on through the IBM/Apple years and into the mid-90's with the launch of Windows 95. It is dated somewhat, especially at the end with the forecasts about the future growth of the internet and what it would mean to PC and Mac development and the world. Nothing was truer then than remains today, predicting the long-term future of the computer and internet industry is simply impossible.What troubles me with this edition by Ambrose is that they have apparently sacrificed bits and pieces here and there for some unfathomable reason. The main points are all still there, but some of the side stories and flavors have been cut. Examples include Steve Wozniak's description of his early interest in electronics in finding an old AT&T; phone company manual to learn to hack into the phone system to call the Pope. It cuts Steve Jobs' description of his early experiences with Bill Gates, saying that the original version of Word was ""just terrible but they kept at it..."", and someone whose name I can't remember describing the early mainframes and trying to use one as ""you were lucky if your entire city had one mainframe, and, if your company had it, there would only be one.""  These are the ones I noticed right off, I'm sure there are others and they are minor things, but it's troubling that a company buys the rights to a show and edits it for whatever reason rather than simply giving us the whole deal.",4,"Still a great show, but the Ambrose edition is not complete!",1098921600,"10 28, 2004",2004,1573,"['Triumph', 'Nerds', 'still', 'one', 'best', 'public', 'level', 'documentaries', 'origins', 'development', 'personal', 'computers', 'beginnings', 'mid-70', 'IBM/Apple', 'years', 'mid-90', 'launch', 'Windows', '95', 'dated', 'somewhat', 'especially', 'end', 'forecasts', 'future', 'growth', 'internet', 'what', 'would', 'mean', 'PC', 'Mac', 'development', 'world', 'Nothing', 'was', 'truer', 'then', 'remains', 'today', 'predicting', 'long-term', 'future', 'computer', 'internet', 'industry', 'simply', 'impossible.What', 'troubles', 'edition', 'Ambrose', 'have', 'apparently', 'sacrificed', 'bits', 'pieces', 'here', 'there', 'unfathomable', 'reason', 'main', 'points', 'are', 'still', 'side', 'stories', 'flavors', 'have', 'been', 'cut', 'Examples', 'include', 'Steve', 'Wozniak', 'description', 'early', 'interest', 'electronics', 'finding', 'old', 'AT', 'T', 'phone', 'company', 'manual', 'learn', 'hack', 'phone', 'system', 'call', 'Pope', 'Steve', 'Jobs', 'description', 'early', 'experiences', 'Bill', 'Gates', 'saying', 'original', 'version', 'Word', 'was', 'just', 'terrible', 'kept', 'someone', 'name', 'ca', ""n't"", 'remember', 'describing', 'early', 'mainframes', 'trying', 'use', 'one', 'were', 'lucky', 'entire', 'city', 'had', 'one', 'mainframe', 'company', 'had', 'would', 'only', 'be', 'one', 'are', 'ones', 'noticed', 'right', ""'m"", 'sure', 'are', 'others', 'are', 'minor', 'things', 'troubling', 'company', 'rights', 'show', 'reason', 'rather', 'simply', 'giving', 'whole', 'deal']",Triumph of the Nerds Gift Set 3-Pk VHS
