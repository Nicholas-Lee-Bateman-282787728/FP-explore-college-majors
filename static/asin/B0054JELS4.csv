I had forgotten how much Tony and Kate bothered me with their ridiculous bickering and banter. Surprised when I re-watched to find out the pain is over after the first two seasons, felt longer in real time as I watched over the years. This next issue was inserting Lauren Holly as Gibbs old girlfriend and now Superior as The Director at NCIS. Her stiff acting and delivery was another hurdle to jump. Pointless to the weekly plots, she constantly intimates their past  ""sexual"" relationship. We all know Gibbs is a very attractive, mysterious man with only one true love and three mystery ex-wives that followed. Thankfully, Holly too was gone... The cast headed by Mark Harmon, David McCallum, Cote de Pablo, Pauley Perrette, Sean Murray, and even the irritating Michael Weatherly are the recipe of great series TV.
