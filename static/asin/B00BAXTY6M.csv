1623612,A3MPQBNZ8ZNLXJ,B00BAXTY6M,Linda D.,"[23, 23]",The product was not as it was advertised.  You do not get season five at all and there are three other shows not even included in seasons 1-4.  It was expensive to buy and not get what you were expecting.  Not all of the DVD's are in show order for some reason so it was very disappointing.,2,Buyer Beware,1371772800,"06 21, 2013",2013,290,"['product', 'was', 'not', 'was', 'advertised', 'do', 'not', 'get', 'season', 'five', 'are', 'three', 'other', 'not', 'even', 'included', 'seasons', '1-4', 'was', 'expensive', 'buy', 'not', 'get', 'what', 'were', 'expecting', 'Not', 'DVD', 'are', 'show', 'order', 'reason', 'was', 'very', 'disappointing']",Flashpoint: Seasons 1-5

I heard it was still going to be running new shows in Australia.  I hope they make releases that can be reviewed in the US.  The characters are great as well as the acting.  They felt like family.  Same on whoever cancelled them here.,5,Flashpoint,1392076800,"02 11, 2014",2014,327,"['one', 'favorite', 'series', 'Im', 'am', 'so', 'sorry', 'will', 'not', 'be', 'seen', 'again', 'US', 'heard', 'was', 'still', 'going', 'be', 'running', 'new', 'shows', 'Australia', 'hope', 'make', 'releases', 'can', 'be', 'reviewed', 'US', 'characters', 'are', 'great', 'as', 'well', 'acting', 'felt', 'family', 'Same', 'cancelled', 'here']",Flashpoint: Seasons 1-5
