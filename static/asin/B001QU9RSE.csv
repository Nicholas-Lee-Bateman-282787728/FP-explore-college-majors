I remember the last season being a little weak, and my memory was definitely accurate. This season took a dive in a similar way that ""The Office"" has the last 2 years. The storylines are ok, but the way the characters act are just downright stupid at times. When it was good, it was a show with good characters and a lot of wise-cracks thrown around. That's what made it funny. Lowell used to be the ridiculous one, but it's as if once he left, they turned every character into the ridiculous one. The most painful to watch was Joe....they turned him into a complete idiot. I feel bad for Tim Daly having to go through that.That said, it's still one of my all-time favorite sitcoms, which is the only reason I'm so critical of the final season.

It's on Netflix now, so my son and I started watching it together.Wings went through some transitions over time:* Season 1 was flat-out funny.* Season 2, my son pointed out to me (and then he quickly lost interest in the series) was a lot of relationship type drama.* Later, they returned to Season 1 style writing.* And then there is Season 8.  Argh.Season 8 had some really REALLY poor writing.  Watching the lines they gave Brian, always one of my favorite characters, was painful.  Helen became more ""animated"" and very unfunny in my opinion.  Joe vacillated between looking uninterested in his lines and yelling all the time.  Casey and Roy were really the only two that shined during this final season, in my opinion, both from a writing perspective and an acting perspective.One unusual thing about this season was you could tell they used a lot of ""canned laughter"".  Helen would say something completely unfunny and the canned laughter would come in, quite loudly.  I wonder if they stopped filming in front of a live studio audience for this last season?  The canned laughter reminded me of watching an episode of Scooby Doo or The Brady Bunch.At any rate, between the poor acting and the poor writing, I wonder if some of the writers left or just no one gave a crap because they knew it was the final hurrah.  Sad, really.  Wings was a real treasure through seven seasons, and I would've thought it would mean more to everyone involved for the last go.Exception to Season 8:  Dreamgirl.

The hilarious and touching series Wings has such a bland final season.  If you dislike battle-of-the-sexes comedies like Everybody loves Raymond and King of Queens you probably won't like this season.  The stories are uninteresting and the dialogue is unfunny.

Spitzer ""mas017""","[19, 22]","Seeing the final season of WINGS again after all these years reminds me of what I always felt was a strange mystery about the show............ that mystery being ... ""What the heck happened behind the scenes in the final season ?""My wife and I have a collection of classic TV shows on DVD that we love and would rather watch 100 times over compared to much of the crap on these days. These include our favorites...... WINGS, CHEERS, SEINFELD, HOGANS HEROES, BECKER, STAR TREK TOS, etc......But this final season of WINGS always seemed very strange.You know how sometimes a show goes off the air and years later a reunion episode is done -or- they try to bring back the series and it feels wrong -- as though the actors could not connect with the vibe of their old characters ?(think some of the Brady reunion shows where in their attempt to recapture the feel of their old characters they end up becoming their own spoofs).WING'S final season seems that way.Of course the stories were just silly and over the top for most of the last season (episodes like the Vacuum Cleaner episode are just painful to watch).  This is the fault of the writers.But in addition to this some of the key actors really overplayed their parts and seemed out of character compared to earlier episodes.  This is especially true of Tim Daly and the way Joe behaved in most of the final season's episodes.  Helen was also over animated most of this last season.Brian, Casey and Roy seemed to stay in character.WINGS is still among our top 5 shows of all time and of course in no form of art or work can the same standard be maintained forever.All things in life have their birth, peak period, decline and eventual departure.  TV shows are no different in that regard.We will continue to watch WINGS over and over many times in our lives in the future, although I think Season 7 will not come out of the DVD case very often.It would be interesting to know something about what was going behind the scenes during this time, as the changes in this last season were very unusual and noticeable.",3,The last season always was a mystery to me,1240099200,"04 19, 2009",2009,2065,"['Seeing', 'final', 'season', 'WINGS', 'again', 'years', 'what', 'always', 'felt', 'was', 'strange', 'mystery', 'show', 'mystery', 'being', 'What', 'heck', 'happened', 'scenes', 'final', 'season', 'wife', 'have', 'collection', 'classic', 'TV', 'shows', 'DVD', 'love', 'would', 'rather', 'watch', '100', 'times', 'over', 'compared', 'much', 'crap', 'days', 'include', 'favorites', 'WINGS', 'CHEERS', 'SEINFELD', 'HOGANS', 'HEROES', 'BECKER', 'STAR', 'TREK', 'TOS', 'etc', 'final', 'season', 'WINGS', 'always', 'seemed', 'very', 'strange.You', 'know', 'how', 'sometimes', 'show', 'air', 'years', 'later', 'reunion', 'episode', 'done', '-or-', 'try', 'bring', 'back', 'series', 'wrong', 'actors', 'could', 'not', 'connect', 'vibe', 'old', 'characters', 'think', 'Brady', 'reunion', 'where', 'attempt', 'recapture', 'feel', 'old', 'characters', 'end', 'up', 'becoming', 'own', 'spoofs', '.WING', 'final', 'season', 'way.Of', 'course', 'stories', 'were', 'just', 'silly', 'top', 'most', 'last', 'season', 'episodes', 'Vacuum', 'Cleaner', 'episode', 'are', 'just', 'painful', 'watch', 'fault', 'writers.But', 'addition', 'key', 'actors', 'really', 'overplayed', 'parts', 'seemed', 'character', 'compared', 'earlier', 'episodes', 'especially', 'true', 'Tim', 'Daly', 'way', 'Joe', 'behaved', 'most', 'final', 'season', 'episodes', 'Helen', 'was', 'also', 'over', 'animated', 'most', 'last', 'season.Brian', 'Casey', 'Roy', 'seemed', 'stay', 'character.WINGS', 'still', 'top', '5', 'shows', 'time', 'course', 'form', 'art', 'work', 'can', 'same', 'standard', 'be', 'maintained', 'forever.All', 'things', 'life', 'have', 'birth', 'peak', 'period', 'decline', 'eventual', 'departure', 'TV', 'shows', 'are', 'different', 'regard.We', 'will', 'continue', 'watch', 'WINGS', 'over', 'many', 'times', 'lives', 'future', 'think', 'Season', '7', 'will', 'not', 'come', 'DVD', 'case', 'very', 'often.It', 'would', 'be', 'interesting', 'know', 'something', 'what', 'was', 'going', 'scenes', 'time', 'changes', 'last', 'season', 'were', 'very', 'unusual', 'noticeable']",Wings: Final Season
