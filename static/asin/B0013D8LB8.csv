If you remember that -sploitation (fill in the class, black, asian, women, etc.) era and cringe, just move on, don't watch this film. If you hate Ron Jeremy and seeing the edge of an adult film set compelete with full frontal male and female nudity, look the other way.This is a paradoy of those B movies. They got the clothing, the lighting, the hair, the bad acting, the cars, the decor (the way walls were painted, furniture, et al), the film stock, the audio, the titles, and the editing absolutely 100% perfect spot on.This is a cast of thousands, almost all B actors with long resumes in television or supporting actors in other films. James Franco shows up, probably the biggest name actor.This got four stars simply because it's such a perfectly done throw back to an era of film making. It's short hour and 24 minutes to the point. There's some good laughs here and there. It feels a bit like a documentary, but is definately not real.This film is R rated and then some. There's a lot of foul language. There is full male and female frontal nudity for exactly the reason a film might get and NC-17 rating. There's a small amount of violence, mostly in recreations of old television programs.

I knew the movie played at the Asian American Film Festival but I couldn't catch it at that time.  When the film was released to theaters in mid-2007, I eagerly looked forward to it.When I finally saw the film, I left feeling slightly disappointed.  While there were some funny bits in the movie (mostly during the auditions), I couldn't help but feel the movie was ""lacking"" something. I think I was expecting a major laugh riot but instead got a movie that subtly pokes at how Hollywood treats Asian American male actors.I don't regret seeing the movie as I support Asian American films and entertainment as best as I can.  It's worth at least a rental to see if you like the film.  However, as far as I am concerned, the film didn't quite live up to the hype.EDIT ON 03/24/09The film has been playing on cable TV recently and I watched it twice in the past few weeks.  You know, without remembering exactly how the film was in the theater, it's not ""as bad as I thought"".  I think the hype and expectations may have skewed some people's view on the film.

I love the way Justin Lin, The Fast and Furious: Tokyo Drift, filmed this as a 70's documentary. It was a totally unepxected surprise to see MC Hammer as Roy Thunder. That was so funny and worth the purchase price right there. Hammer should be in more films because he can really act. In fact, one of the funniest lines in Finishing the Game, is when MC Hammer says, ""I'm always on the lookout for the next Pat Morita.""After Bruce Lee died, several Asian actors tried to make Bruceploitation movies that had such stupid titles as Bruce Lee Fights Back From the Grave and Re-enter the Dragon. The Hong Kong film industry was in a panic to try to prolouge Bruce Lee's star power as long as they could by hiring look-a-likes and wannabes. Lin wonderfully satirized that with Fists of Fuhrer and he nailed it in the character Breeze Loo.This film is also a look at how Asian actors were treated for a long time by Hollywood in such roles as delivery boys and servants. The real Bruce Lee did a lot to try to change the way Asians are looked at in film. Ironically because of Lee's achievements, now Hollywood is trying to sell Asians as martial arts stars, which means that few Asians are represented as being real. They are mostly reduced to oriental exoticism to sell tickets. Hollywood has yet to make a movie with Asians actors that really show a good well written story that doesn't exploit.This movie is a lot of fun. The fact that it doesn't take itself so seriously makes it an enjoyable ride.

The casting director is really the main character here (shared with the couple having problems figuring out their actor/manager relationship) and she fails to deliver more than cliche.  A few mildly good scenes (and I liked the Aussie-Bruce who bails on the production) do not a movie make.  Character arcs do not satisfy and the movie just ends with a thud (with a cameo by Bottoms.)

There's a good naturedness here, perhaps it's necessary for a comedy like this. I think I felt kind of sorry for the fictional characters being portrayed. The movie goes in different directions tho. At one point one of the Bruce Lee tryouts stands next to a scruffy, bearded guy (always wearing the white Karate outfit in the film) and says, ""I always try and look good, that's why I always stand next to him"". I'm not up on this genre but I suspect it was an inside joke about the Chuck Norris types present in some of these films. It was funny. Hope I laughed at the right thing.I Caught this on what must have been free HBO night and missed the very beginning. Didn't completely understand the premise. I thought they were trying out to portray Bruce Lee, the way Will Smith has portrayed Muhammed Ali, etc, or they wanted another star who simply could conjure up the same image as Lee.There's a sort-of conservative element to this movie (aside from the part where a tryout beats up his hero, the guys he's worshipped onscreen, for moving in on his girlfriend and then she goes back to him - I was Ok with that bit of myth making). Late in the movie the producer or the big boss comes in to see how the casting process is going and hes very dissappointed. . . they've narrowed it down to a prospect who's 7 feet tall, a white guy, and another guy (forget his problem). The producers says, ""Darn it, #!#!#!#, I could go to Chinatown and be back with a guy who looks like Bruce Lee in 10 minutes!"" If he said this at the beginning of the movie it would have been one of the most insensitive to say things ever, by the end of the movie when he says this it seems like he's the only one who makes sense.I thought it was very funny.
