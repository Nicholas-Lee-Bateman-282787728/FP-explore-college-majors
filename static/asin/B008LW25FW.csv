1570163,A3JY82VJGNUIKE,B008LW25FW,"Garan Grey ""Garan Grey""","[31, 33]","There are several nice movies here, many are among my favorites.  However...Every one of these movies is new enough to have been produced in the current 16x9 widescreen aspect ratio common to today's television sets.  When you watch them on Lifetime or wherever, if you have a current model HDTV they all fill your screen and the picture looks fine.Not these DVDs, which are ALL cropped at the sides back to the square shape of older TV sets that haven't been made for years.  I don't know what Lifetime was thinking.  This would be a great product if it were being released in 1998.If you have a square, standard definition set, these discs might look fine, but on my 47"" HDTV, from a Blu Ray player that UPscales SD content - these all look like an old VHS tape that was recorded in the six-hour long-play mode.  So grainy they look like they were projected on a popcorn-stucco ceiling.  That means that on standard DVD players they probably look worse.  There is no excuse for new movies to look this bad in any current video format.Amazon's product specs were again dead wrong in listing this set as being in widescreen.  (I found a similar problem on another Christmas title here)  When I called Amazon to report this, the operator suggested I click on the ""update product info"" option, but Amazon demands all kinds of proof (other websites, pictures, etc) and apparently the fact that I bought one  was not enough.  Since I am not paid by Amazon to do their product verification, I am not going to do all their vetting and research work for them  just to prove what I saw with my own eyes.Amazon has since altered this listing to remove the word Widescreen, but it is still not made clear that these movies are changed from their original format, cropped to fit square 4x3 TVs.  And again, there's the low resolution picture quality.  If these were in fact old VHS tapes in EP mode, the picture quality would be understandable, but being produced for DVD from new material, they should at least hold the best quality level of a DVD.  They do not.As for the movies, they're the same ones that pop up on TV every year, (I LIKE them, and they're well worth watching IF presented properly)... BUT if these DVDs don't look even as good as the movies do on TV, why bother buying them?  I am returning this set as mislabeled and setting the DVR to record them.  I suggest you do as well.  Save your money and get better quality for free.",1,These DVDs look like old VHS tapes - The movies look better on Television!,1353715200,"11 24, 2012",2012,2436,"['are', 'several', 'nice', 'movies', 'here', 'many', 'are', 'favorites', 'However', 'Every', 'one', 'movies', 'new', 'enough', 'have', 'been', 'produced', 'current', '16x9', 'widescreen', 'aspect', 'ratio', 'common', 'today', 'television', 'sets', 'When', 'watch', 'Lifetime', 'wherever', 'have', 'current', 'model', 'HDTV', 'fill', 'screen', 'picture', 'fine.Not', 'DVDs', 'are', 'ALL', 'cropped', 'sides', 'back', 'square', 'shape', 'older', 'TV', 'sets', 'have', ""n't"", 'been', 'made', 'years', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'what', 'Lifetime', 'was', 'thinking', 'would', 'be', 'great', 'product', 'were', 'being', 'released', '1998.If', 'have', 'square', 'standard', 'definition', 'set', 'discs', 'might', 'look', 'fine', '47', 'HDTV', 'Blu', 'Ray', 'player', 'SD', 'content', 'look', 'old', 'VHS', 'tape', 'was', 'recorded', 'six-hour', 'long-play', 'mode', 'grainy', 'look', 'were', 'projected', 'popcorn-stucco', 'ceiling', 'standard', 'DVD', 'players', 'probably', 'look', 'worse', 'excuse', 'new', 'movies', 'look', 'bad', 'current', 'video', 'format.Amazon', 'product', 'specs', 'were', 'again', 'dead', 'wrong', 'listing', 'set', 'being', 'widescreen', 'found', 'similar', 'problem', 'Christmas', 'title', 'here', 'When', 'called', 'Amazon', 'report', 'operator', 'suggested', 'click', 'update', 'product', 'info', 'option', 'Amazon', 'kinds', 'proof', 'other', 'websites', 'pictures', 'etc', 'apparently', 'fact', 'bought', 'one', 'was', 'not', 'enough', 'am', 'not', 'paid', 'Amazon', 'do', 'product', 'verification', 'am', 'not', 'going', 'do', 'vetting', 'research', 'work', 'just', 'prove', 'what', 'saw', 'own', 'eyes.Amazon', 'altered', 'listing', 'remove', 'word', 'Widescreen', 'still', 'not', 'made', 'clear', 'movies', 'are', 'changed', 'original', 'format', 'cropped', 'fit', 'square', '4x3', 'TVs', 'again', 'low', 'resolution', 'picture', 'quality', 'were', 'fact', 'old', 'VHS', 'tapes', 'EP', 'mode', 'picture', 'quality', 'would', 'be', 'understandable', 'being', 'produced', 'DVD', 'new', 'material', 'should', 'least', 'hold', 'best', 'quality', 'level', 'DVD', 'do', 'not.As', 'movies', ""'re"", 'same', 'ones', 'pop', 'up', 'TV', 'year', 'LIKE', ""'re"", 'well', 'worth', 'watching', 'IF', 'presented', 'properly', 'BUT', 'DVDs', 'do', ""n't"", 'look', 'even', 'as', 'good', 'movies', 'do', 'TV', 'why', 'bother', 'buying', 'am', 'returning', 'set', 'mislabeled', 'setting', 'DVR', 'record', 'suggest', 'do', 'as', 'well', 'Save', 'money', 'get', 'better', 'quality', 'free']",N/A
