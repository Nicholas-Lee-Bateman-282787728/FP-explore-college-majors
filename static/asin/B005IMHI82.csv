He had been asking for it from his parents and they told him that they would try to get one for him. And lo and behold, Grandma sent it to him. He watched it a several times throughout the Christmas holiday. It is worth the purchase to give to a grandchild when you don't know what else to give them.",5,Excellent holiday gift,1326067200,"01 9, 2012",2012,379,"['Grandson', 'thoroughly', 'enjoyed', 'movie', 'was', 'given', 'gift', 'had', 'been', 'asking', 'parents', 'told', 'would', 'try', 'get', 'one', 'lo', 'behold', 'Grandma', 'sent', 'watched', 'several', 'times', 'Christmas', 'holiday', 'purchase', 'give', 'grandchild', 'when', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'what', 'else', 'give']",Beethoven's Christmas Adventure

1461905,A255EMQZTRGKAH,B005IMHI82,eb,"[1, 2]","Beethoven is the supporting cast in a movie about a widow, her teenage son and an advertising campaign for the ASPCA.  The movie has little of the charm of the earlier Beethoven movies.  Preteens will get a few chuckles from this, but this is not a movie for kids who still believe in Santa.I rated it only two stars for the thin plot, poor acting, and blatant advertising.  I've been adopted by shelter dogs, heartily support pet adoption, but this movie was just awful.  Definitely overpriced as well.",2,Not For Kids Who Still Believe In Santa,1353715200,"11 24, 2012",2012,503,"['Beethoven', 'supporting', 'cast', 'movie', 'widow', 'teenage', 'son', 'advertising', 'campaign', 'ASPCA', 'movie', 'little', 'charm', 'earlier', 'Beethoven', 'movies', 'Preteens', 'will', 'get', 'few', 'chuckles', 'not', 'movie', 'kids', 'who', 'still', 'believe', 'Santa.I', 'rated', 'only', 'two', 'stars', 'thin', 'plot', 'poor', 'acting', 'blatant', 'advertising', ""'ve"", 'been', 'adopted', 'shelter', 'dogs', 'heartily', 'support', 'pet', 'adoption', 'movie', 'was', 'just', 'awful', 'Definitely', 'overpriced', 'well']",Beethoven's Christmas Adventure
1461906,AL4SB31UAZLXL,B005IMHI82,"Jennifer Donovan ""5minutesforbooks""","[7, 9]","Kid movies, especially in the direct to DVD variety like this one, are pretty formulaic, but that doesn't mean that they aren't going to entertain your family.This movie includes the following predictable plot elements -- parent whose work gets more attention than their children and evil criminals. Add a real-life Christmas elf who falls out of the sled, losing Santa's magic toy bag, and a big slobbery Saint Bernard, and you've got elements that kids will enjoy.In this movie Beethoven and the stray dog that tags along for this adventure can talk -- sort of. You see, the elf is actually a stable elf who takes care of the reindeer and all animals at the North pole, so he is able to understand dogs. Hearing the dogs talk added a lot of humor and some heart to the movie, and I appreciated the way this plot twist was presented.CONTENT NOTE: I like to alert parents to plot elements that some choose to avoid. There are some passing gas joking (from dogs), and before the teen learns to ""believe"" he tells the Christmas Elf who has come straight from the North Pole that believing in Santa is kid stuff, but my 7-year-old didn't blink an eye at that.",4,Fun for the kids and not awful for the parents,1321920000,"11 22, 2011",2011,1156,"['Kid', 'movies', 'especially', 'direct', 'DVD', 'variety', 'one', 'are', 'pretty', 'formulaic', ""n't"", 'mean', 'are', ""n't"", 'going', 'entertain', 'family.This', 'movie', 'following', 'predictable', 'plot', 'elements', 'parent', 'work', 'more', 'attention', 'children', 'evil', 'criminals', 'Add', 'real-life', 'Christmas', 'elf', 'who', 'sled', 'losing', 'Santa', 'magic', 'toy', 'bag', 'big', 'slobbery', 'Saint', 'Bernard', ""'ve"", 'got', 'elements', 'kids', 'will', 'enjoy.In', 'movie', 'Beethoven', 'stray', 'dog', 'along', 'adventure', 'can', 'talk', 'sort', 'see', 'elf', 'actually', 'stable', 'elf', 'who', 'care', 'reindeer', 'animals', 'North', 'pole', 'able', 'understand', 'dogs', 'Hearing', 'dogs', 'talk', 'added', 'lot', 'humor', 'heart', 'movie', 'appreciated', 'way', 'plot', 'twist', 'was', 'presented.CONTENT', 'NOTE', 'like', 'alert', 'parents', 'plot', 'elements', 'choose', 'avoid', 'are', 'passing', 'gas', 'joking', 'dogs', 'teen', 'believe', 'Christmas', 'Elf', 'who', 'come', 'straight', 'North', 'Pole', 'believing', 'Santa', 'kid', 'stuff', '7-year-old', 'did', ""n't"", 'blink', 'eye']",Beethoven's Christmas Adventure
