A lot of people don't take it as seriously because it has spoof elements (with Dawn French and Jennifer Saunders present, which Dusty asked for herself).  But it's a good overview of Dusty's career to that point (up to 1994-95, when A Very Fine Love was being recorded) and hey, you get Dusty herself talking all about it.  Which is appreciated after so many of the subsequent biographical accounts of her life tend to be downers that lean more towards the controversies rather than balancing that with the music and ""good"" times.  And lots of delightful archive clips can be seen as well!

The VHS tape has a hissing in some spots that seems to be defects in the tape  rather than from source material, which is mostly from the 1960s.But this tape is worth the purchase.  Two pieces of musical footage - Ms. Springfield singing &quot;Poor Wayfaring Stranger&quot; from  her 1965 BBC TV series, and her rendition of &quot;A House is Not a Home&quot; from a 1970 Burt Bacharach TV show, make this an essential purchase for her fans.  She was literally the greatest singer of the 20th century.  But her affectations, such as the beehive hairdo and the heavy  eye makeup seemed to detract some viewers from ever looking further at the woman who has been called The White Queen of Soul and who with her Dusty in Memphis classic album produced a work that Rolling Stone ranks among the 10 coolest pop records of all time.  This lady was the real thing.  Her career cooled off in the mid-70s after she announced her bisexuality and apparently after she may have received a throat injury of some sort.  The Pet Shop Boys revived her career with &quot;What Have I Done to Deserve This&quot;  I'll always be in their debt for this as it introduced me to Ms. Springfield as something other than the lounge singer I thought she was.  Her perfect pitch and beautiful voice have placed her music at the top of my collection.

This video was done around the time she was recording ' A Very Fine Love ' , her final album, and from what I can judge by her biographies, she probably already knew she had cancer , which makes it all the more poignant. Her 'House is not a Home' singing with Burt Bachrach on piano is worth the price of the video by itself ! If you are really a true Dusty fan , and you don't have this , then buy it now.

490136,AW1LLQVIYVEWZ,B000003H7B,"S. Sittig ""Divawatch""","[9, 9]","Full Circle?  Hmm..how about 3/4 of the circle?This way too brief documentary, attempts to cover the vast musical history of one of the greatest (if not the greatest) pop singers of the 20th century, who's career spanned 40+ years, in just 1 hour.  That was a foolish thought.From her early days with the Lana Sisters and The Springfields, to her triumphant chart breaking smashes of the 60s, to her resurgence with the Pet Shop Boys in the late 80s, the program tries to give us a comprehensive look at Dusty's career, but leaves many many stones unturned.  And some of them are sacriligiously left that way.The problem is, by ignoring the vast high quality material from her ""dark period"" or ""lost years"" (roughly 1972-1987) when Dusty was not spinning out chart hits or simply not singing with any regularity, it denies the viewer the insight into Miss Springfield's highly complex character, her drive, her keen sense of artistry, and most importantly, of seeing (and hearing) Dusty at her peak vocally.  Some of the work from 1970 -74 especially, is criminally overlooked.Other than a brief clip (glorious as it is) from her Royal Albert Hall smash concert in 1979, and a stunning live rendition of ""A House Is Not A Home"" with Burt Bacharach himself at the piano (circa 1972?), we get nothing from the 70s Dusty whatsoever...I suppose it's hard to get all the information out there, but Serena Cross's much superior British documentary, DEFINITELY DUSTY does a much better job at giving the viewer a complete (or somewhat more complete) picture of the reclusive icon.The mock question and answer set-up with Jennifer Saunders (of ABFAB fame) and Dawn French hamming it up, is fun at first, but gets a little annoying towards the end and is somewhat distracting from the subject at hand.  Who wants to waste precious time watching Miss French or Miss Saunders crack a stale joke when instead we could have more stunning musical footage of Dusty doing what she did best, singing Pop music with an amazing sensitivity and ear for subtle rhythms.Nevertheless, i'd still like to see this on DVD, if nothing else for the stunning clips of live performances from knock-your-socks off renditions of ""Dancing In The Streets"" and ""Nowhere To Run"" to the sight of Dusty dueting with Jimi Hendrix, Tom Jones and even Marvin Gaye!",4,DUSTY SPRINGFIELD: NOT A FULL CIRCLE...,1058745600,"07 21, 2003",2003,2323,"['Full', 'Circle', 'Hmm..how', '3/4', 'circle', 'way', 'too', 'brief', 'documentary', 'attempts', 'cover', 'vast', 'musical', 'history', 'one', 'greatest', 'not', 'greatest', 'pop', 'singers', '20th', 'century', 'who', 'career', 'spanned', '40+', 'years', 'just', '1', 'hour', 'was', 'foolish', 'thought.From', 'early', 'days', 'Lana', 'Sisters', 'Springfields', 'triumphant', 'chart', 'breaking', 'smashes', '60s', 'resurgence', 'Pet', 'Shop', 'Boys', 'late', '80s', 'program', 'tries', 'give', 'comprehensive', 'look', 'Dusty', 'career', 'many', 'many', 'stones', 'unturned', 'are', 'sacriligiously', 'left', 'way.The', 'problem', 'ignoring', 'vast', 'high', 'quality', 'material', 'dark', 'period', 'lost', 'years', 'roughly', '1972-1987', 'when', 'Dusty', 'was', 'not', 'spinning', 'out', 'chart', 'hits', 'simply', 'not', 'singing', 'regularity', 'viewer', 'insight', 'Miss', 'Springfield', 'highly', 'complex', 'character', 'drive', 'keen', 'sense', 'artistry', 'most', 'importantly', 'seeing', 'hearing', 'Dusty', 'peak', 'vocally', 'work', '1970', '-74', 'especially', 'criminally', 'overlooked.Other', 'brief', 'clip', 'glorious', 'Royal', 'Albert', 'Hall', 'smash', 'concert', '1979', 'stunning', 'live', 'rendition', 'A', 'House', 'Not', 'Home', 'Burt', 'Bacharach', 'piano', 'circa', '1972', 'get', 'nothing', '70s', 'Dusty', 'whatsoever', 'suppose', 'hard', 'get', 'information', 'there', 'Serena', 'Cross', 'much', 'superior', 'British', 'documentary', 'DEFINITELY', 'DUSTY', 'much', 'better', 'job', 'giving', 'viewer', 'complete', 'somewhat', 'more', 'complete', 'picture', 'reclusive', 'icon.The', 'mock', 'question', 'answer', 'set-up', 'Jennifer', 'Saunders', 'ABFAB', 'fame', 'Dawn', 'French', 'hamming', 'up', 'fun', 'first', 'little', 'annoying', 'end', 'somewhat', 'distracting', 'subject', 'hand', 'Who', 'waste', 'precious', 'time', 'watching', 'Miss', 'French', 'Miss', 'Saunders', 'crack', 'stale', 'joke', 'when', 'instead', 'could', 'have', 'more', 'stunning', 'musical', 'footage', 'Dusty', 'doing', 'what', 'did', 'best', 'singing', 'Pop', 'music', 'amazing', 'sensitivity', 'ear', 'subtle', 'rhythms.Nevertheless', 'i', ""'d"", 'still', 'like', 'see', 'DVD', 'nothing', 'else', 'stunning', 'clips', 'live', 'performances', 'knock-your-socks', 'renditions', 'Dancing', 'Streets', 'Nowhere', 'Run', 'sight', 'Dusty', 'dueting', 'Jimi', 'Hendrix', 'Tom', 'Jones', 'even', 'Marvin', 'Gaye']",N/A

I bought the VHS version of this interview with the wonderful Dawn French and Jennifer Saunders as the hosts of a Full Circle. There were some interesting clips from Dusty's musical career. They shyed away from her sexual orientation which was a good thing because Dusty was part of this show and it had really nothing to do with her musical career. She should have been treated better even after her death. Dusty was too shy to talk about her personal life but she wasn't shy to talk about her music, fame, and pitfalls of being sucessful. This program was never meant to do anything to tarnish her wonderful image as one of Britain's greatest female singers. Even now, we miss her still.
