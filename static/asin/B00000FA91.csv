There were variations of course. The Proposal was different than Blade 3 but the underlying ... portrayal was the same at it's core. I really enjoy that portrayal because he makes me laugh. He has made me laugh in Two guys, a girl and a pizza place; Foolproof; Just Friends; The In-Laws; Definitely, Maybe and Van Wilder. An outstanding comedic actor.This film, as well as his others, Buried and Smokin Aces (A film that I don't recommend for anything other than Reynold's and Jeremy Piven's performances), shows just what kind of range this man can show us. When he gets the news that his life is built on a lie and he takes that hit emotionally... I never doubted his reaction. Totally believable how he responds to what he perceives, rightfully so, as the destruction of his world and his attempts to find any kind of meaningful path to get through that chaos are such that you could not help but feel his pain even though he didn't say a word on the drive back from the revelation.Not to say that there is no humor, there is, or that the other people in this movie aren't excellent, they are.

I will not go through the many details as the surprise twists are what give value to this story. However the father explains that you cannot plan on events, but you can choose to love.With some of the almost slapstick actions and not likely events I can see how someone would take this as a comedy.

The secret is making lists, the more specific the better. His list making abilities have been so successful he makes a living teaching business seminars the profitability of list making.Yes things are almost too perfect for the handsome, intelligent and successful husband and Father. That is until Frank's life takes a chaotic turn for the worse and he is faced with events that cannot be solved by writing them down on a piece of paper. There's only one solution, a new paradigm must be adapted if he is to survive what lies ahead; the Chaos Theory.Critique: You're always off to a good start in any film when you have the likes of Ryan Reynolds in the starring role. Another big plus for the '07 dark comedy romance `Chaos Theory' is the presence of the talented Emily Mortimer as Reynolds wife Susan.If you're like me you just might be surprised early on in this film that it isn't quite what you expected. If that's the case fight the urge to tune out and stay focused, there's really a lot going on in this film if you give it a chance.

I found this one from Canada on Amazon.com, and I think this 2008 release, which stars Ryan Reynolds, is the one my friend had in mind.Filmed during Reynolds' steady ascent to A-List status, he flawlessly inhabits a character who is more than a little ADD. This guy is a time-management expert who has a successful career as an author and a lecturer. His wife has a more cavalier attitude about time, consequently she causes him to miss his ferry ride, which sets off a series of events which irrevocably change their lives.Here are the principal players:* Ryan Reynolds (""The Proposal"" and ""Green Lantern"") is our overly organized maker of lists. By the time he embraces chaos, he is seriously off track.* Emily Mortimer (""Match Point"" and ""Lars and the Real Girl"") is his impatient wife. She would like more spontaneity in their marriage.* Stuart Townsend (""The Best Man"" and ""The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen"") is a long-time friend of both.* Matreya Fedor (lots of TV) is their nine-year-old daughter...smile...By the time our hero buys a shotgun, I was actively involved in this script and had my fingers crossed.

499831,AYNIU2T9RWO6B,B00000FA91,Namrezy,"[1, 1]","I wanted to like this movie.  This type of character is perfect for Ryan Reynolds and the movie had the makings (according to the other reviews I read) of being one of those low budget dark-comedy gems that turns out to be unexpectedly good.It wasn't.--NO SPOILER REVIEW--We are all different people with differing opinions, but I cannot see where anyone would give this movie 5 out of 5 stars; even 4 is a stretch.  The acting in this movie is average AT BEST, the flow of the plot lines are jagged, the situations depicted were almost always unrealistic, and the movie had no idea what it wanted to be.  A comedy?  A dark comedy?  A drama?  A dram-edy?Listen: Not Ryan Reynolds' best movie and this is one of those movies that if you have very few other options in place for your viewing pleasure, you can watch this movie and not think it an absolute waste of your life if you do.  Wanted to give it 2.5 out of 5, but since I can't, had to round down once I started thinking about it again.--SPOILERS REVIEW--Okay, this movie essentially kicks off by their group of friends talking about what they've named their penises, but more painstakingly unfortunate, every one of them, in fact, has a name for theirs.  What?  The main female character then goes on to exclaim she wants a husband for a New Year's resolution and she will pick from her friends (using sound reasoning only existing in the movies, mind you). About a minute or so later you get the impression Ryan Reynolds was her choice all along, but that doesn't stop this from feeling gimmicky from the start or written by a 10 year old.Fast-forward a bit and Ryan Reynolds' life starts falling apart as soon as he's late for the ferry.  Now, I'm no expert on the ways and means of aquatic-transportation, but the worker not letting him on the ferry is absolute crap.  There is no one else waiting, they haven't pulled up the ramps yet, and the next ferry doesn't leave for another HOUR, there is NO REASON they couldn't let this ONE GUY aboard the ferry.  A minor discrepancy, yes, but to base the start of the premise on this is, again, written by a 10 year old.This movie is 1hr 27m 48s long (roughly) and there are two distinct parts where they spend way too much time on something that has nothing to do with the overall arch of the story.  1) When he's driving the pregnant woman to the hospital, we get the pleasure of spending almost 3+ minutes inside the car while he tells her to breath?  Wow.  2) Then, when he finds out he's sterile, we get another 3+ minutes of him sitting by the river half crying/vomiting/gagging.  In a 90-minute movie, you can't have 6'ish minutes of nothing.Also, he's angry at his wife because she accidentally set the clock ahead 10 minutes, making him late, and this eventually causes him to have drinks and flirt with a hot blonde, ultimately winding up in his room with her almost naked?  Again...what?  Where on earth would a HAPPILY married man with a young daughter wind up in bed with another female, with his friend present at the bar (a friend who openly flirts with his wife, mind you).  It doesn't matter nothing ultimately happens, and he ultimately rejects her, doesn't matter he had been drinking, IT DOES NOT MATTER, this is so cliche and undermining I took an entire star off of my review for that.Some other points: The nurse's phone call and how professional it was, their fight when he first gets home after delivering the pregnant woman to the hospital (no chance of explaining himself, we just go right into the cliche ""you're the devil, get out forever!""), Buddy's speech when he tries to convince the wife he loves her and he wants to raise ""his"" daughter...was some of the worst dialogue in the movie (Buddy's character development up to this point...he might as well be wallpaper).  And how did the pregnant woman find out where he lived anyway if she left the hospital?  Magic?Also, the wife sleeps with Buddy (the best friend of the guy she chooses) less than a week before choosing her husband?  What?  And her defense of this is ""But it was only you after, promise!""

Before he does, however, the anal, overly organized father feels he must impart some words of wisdom to his soon-to-be son-in-law, Ed (Mike Erwin).Frank's wisdom plays out over the course of the movieChaos Theoryas he shares a dramatic tale of the ups and downs of his own marriage experience.  As the story begins, Frank and his buddy, Buddy (Stuart Townsend) are fighting over the same girl, Susan Allen (Emily Mortimer).  Susan chooses to be with Frank and the two get married and have a daughter.  Jesse is seven at the beginning of the movie.When Frank leaves for a lecture, his highly structured existence is screwed up when Susan intends to set the clock ahead 10 minutes as a joke, but instead sets it behind.  Frank ends up late for a lecture about time management.  Following the lecture, Frank is approached by the beautiful Paula Crowe (Sarah Chalke), who was at the lecture.  After several drinks and seductive compliments, Paula works her way into Frank's room.  Susan calls to check in and Frank immediately runs out to return home.On his way home, Frank (driving drunk) runs a pregnant woman off the road.  Although attempting to do a good deed by helping her to the hospital, Frank actually sets off a chain reaction of events that lead to tale of love, forgiveness, and chaos.  This move is extremely thoughtful and charming.  Reynolds is one of our favorite actors and is brilliant as he portrays his character during multiple points in his life.  Emily Mortimer is also excellent in her role as the sought after leading lady, wife, and mother.  Her emotional acting is excellent.
