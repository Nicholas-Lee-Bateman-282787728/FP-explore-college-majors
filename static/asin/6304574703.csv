428745,A3LU79BYMWZEW9,6304574703,Gregor von Kallahann,"[1, 1]","I recall my dad loved Red Skelton back in the day, but even when I was a little kid I remember being somewhat put off by the cute sign-offs for his weekly show (the high pitched, overly sincere ""Good-bye for now and may God bless."").  These days I'm a bit more patient--or maybe just plain old nostalgic.  But I did enjoy taking an hour or so this past Christmas Day to watch this old chestnut.Yes, Skelton traded in whimsical charm, but there's a place for that.  His Freddy the Freeloader was more less of a down-and-outer than a survivor, in that feisty, cartoonish Bugs Bunny kind of way.  An outsider, who's really not hurting all that badly; in fact, he's almost thriving in his ""outsiderness.""Interestingly, Skelton doesn't totally ignore the seamier sides of homelessness.  Freddy remains something of an innocent throughout, but he does encounter a sweet-natured pickpocket (Imogene Coca) and a surly, drunken Santa whom he gently takes to task.  And he heads off to a Christmas dinner he cannot afford with a down on his luck would-be intellectual nicknamed the Professor (well played by Vincent Price) who he has to bail out of jail before they can proceed to the fancy restaurant where he has (somehow) succeeding in making reservations.Along the way, there's the almost obligatory stop at a children's ward in the regional hospital, where Freddy is mistaken for a clown (hmm. wonder why!) and does some low key entertaining for the kids.  Actually, ""low key"" is not a bad term for the whole affair.  And therein lies its charm--for some anyway.  I'm not sure if this video, or Red Skelton in general would have much appeal for a generation brough up on brash, off-color and self-consciously ironic comedy.  After all, recall that I was a little skeptical of it even in the 60s.But I find it a bit refreshing now.  Or maybe it just makes me think of my dad.  Whatever.  It worked for me, this time out.  So, uh, ""Goodbye for now and may God bless.""",4,A Certain Whistful Charm,1230940800,"01 3, 2009",2009,1960,"['recall', 'dad', 'loved', 'Red', 'Skelton', 'back', 'day', 'even', 'when', 'was', 'little', 'kid', 'remember', 'being', 'somewhat', 'put', 'off', 'cute', 'sign-offs', 'weekly', 'show', 'high', 'pitched', 'overly', 'sincere', 'Good-bye', 'now', 'may', 'God', 'bless.', 'days', ""'m"", 'bit', 'more', 'patient', 'maybe', 'just', 'plain', 'old', 'nostalgic', 'did', 'enjoy', 'taking', 'hour', 'so', 'past', 'Christmas', 'Day', 'watch', 'old', 'chestnut.Yes', 'Skelton', 'traded', 'whimsical', 'charm', 'place', 'Freddy', 'Freeloader', 'was', 'more', 'less', 'down-and-outer', 'survivor', 'feisty', 'cartoonish', 'Bugs', 'Bunny', 'kind', 'way', 'outsider', 'who', 'really', 'not', 'hurting', 'badly', 'fact', 'almost', 'thriving', 'outsiderness', 'Interestingly', 'Skelton', ""n't"", 'totally', 'ignore', 'seamier', 'sides', 'homelessness', 'Freddy', 'something', 'innocent', 'encounter', 'sweet-natured', 'pickpocket', 'Imogene', 'Coca', 'surly', 'Santa', 'whom', 'gently', 'task', 'Christmas', 'dinner', 'can', 'not', 'afford', 'down', 'luck', 'would-be', 'intellectual', 'nicknamed', 'Professor', 'well', 'played', 'Vincent', 'Price', 'who', 'bail', 'jail', 'can', 'proceed', 'fancy', 'restaurant', 'where', 'somehow', 'succeeding', 'making', 'reservations.Along', 'way', 'almost', 'obligatory', 'stop', 'children', 'ward', 'regional', 'hospital', 'where', 'Freddy', 'mistaken', 'clown', 'hmm', 'wonder', 'why', 'low', 'key', 'entertaining', 'kids', 'Actually', 'low', 'key', 'not', 'bad', 'term', 'whole', 'affair', 'therein', 'charm', 'anyway', ""'m"", 'not', 'sure', 'video', 'Red', 'Skelton', 'general', 'would', 'have', 'much', 'appeal', 'generation', 'brash', 'off-color', 'self-consciously', 'ironic', 'comedy', 'recall', 'was', 'little', 'skeptical', 'even', '60s.But', 'find', 'bit', 'refreshing', 'now', 'maybe', 'just', 'think', 'dad', 'worked', 'time', 'out', 'So', 'uh', 'Goodbye', 'now', 'may', 'God', 'bless']",N/A
428746,A3EOHYIHQM3KK,6304574703,Sean Ares Hirsch,"[26, 26]","This is a delightful Christmas special. Not only is Freddy full of comical wit, but he also emphasizes thinking of others at Christmas. There is something very poetic in how he ends up giving all of his Christmas dinner money away to benefit others, and then someone not only buys a Christmas dinner for him, but for his friends as well. Vincent Price does not enter until the 2nd half, but once he does, we are exposed to twice as much comedy. These two make a memorable team. The photography is well done, and the music is clever. Even characters like the drunk Santa who only have minor roles seem to make the most of them. If you have an hour to spare between Christmas preperations, this is one of the nicest ways to spend it.",4,Comical and Meaningful,974505600,"11 18, 2000",2000,731,"['delightful', 'Christmas', 'special', 'Not', 'only', 'Freddy', 'full', 'comical', 'wit', 'also', 'thinking', 'others', 'Christmas', 'something', 'very', 'poetic', 'how', 'up', 'giving', 'Christmas', 'dinner', 'money', 'away', 'benefit', 'others', 'then', 'someone', 'not', 'only', 'Christmas', 'dinner', 'friends', 'as', 'well', 'Vincent', 'Price', 'not', 'enter', '2nd', 'half', 'once', 'are', 'exposed', 'twice', 'as', 'much', 'comedy', 'two', 'make', 'memorable', 'team', 'photography', 'well', 'done', 'music', 'clever', 'Even', 'characters', 'drunk', 'Santa', 'who', 'only', 'have', 'minor', 'roles', 'seem', 'make', 'most', 'have', 'hour', 'spare', 'Christmas', 'preperations', 'one', 'nicest', 'ways', 'spend']",N/A
