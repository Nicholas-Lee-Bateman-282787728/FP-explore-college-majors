This is the worst writing of any of them so far with major overacting by the bad guy, completely unrealistic really. All of the gritty realism has been stripped away and replaced with soap opera antics. The writers have also turned Helen Mirren's character into a total dunderhead. What she does at the end is beyond words. It's as if the writers or producers decided to model the show after Murder She Wrote or Matlock or even Columbo. Her character is so much smarter than that and deserves better. Nobody with her level of experience and intelligence would behave so stupidly or put her life at such risk. Even the case is uninteresting. Everyone who watched it with me felt no compassion for the victims or anyone involved for that matter. Usually we are all transfixed from beginning to end.

This character goes by the nickname ""the Street"" and he manages to get under Tennison's skin probably more than any of the criminals she's faced.  The setting is intriguing, inner city Manchester in neighborhoods where drug gangs rule the roost more than the police could ever hope to.To me, the story was compelling right up to the ending and then unraveled some...&lt;spoilers>1.  The actions of ""the Street"" at the very end would make no sense in the real world and seem entirely designed to make for a rather phony scene where he finally gets his just desserts.2.  Just when we are given to believe that Tennison is about to be killed by the Street, a police SWAT team magically appears and kills him...never mind the extreme unlikelihood they would have found the place where he and she were confronting each other.3.  Tennison leads too much from the front in this story, doing a number of things I'm almost certain an officer of her high rank would delegate....&lt;end spoilers>But if you can grit your teeth and consciously set aside the rather cheesy ending to this installment of Prime Suspect, it is definitely watchable and entertaining ... although not quite packing the same emotional wallop of the preceding four installments.
