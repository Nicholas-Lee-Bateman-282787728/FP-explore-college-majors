Then I saw Moore perform &#34;Red House&#34; on &#34;The Strat Pack&#34; DVD and that was enough to convince me I had to have this concert. (The &#34;Strat Pack&#34; DVD is apparently no longer available for Region 1.)Likes: Video is sharp and clear and without special effects, the sound is well balanced and of consistent volume. Moore's ability to play &#34;Hendrix style&#34; is phenominal!  When Mitchell and Cox join Moore for the last few songs and the chemistry between them is fantastic. In fact they enable Moore to stretch to a higher level of playing.Dislikes: The concert was too short. The Band of Gypsys appear only on the last few songs, not that Moore's band is bad but there should have been two whole concerts- one with each band.This DVD has motivated me to search for Moore's other works and to revisit other artists covering Hendrix's material.",5,A marvelous find!,1378512000,"09 7, 2013",2013,968,"[""'m"", 'longtime', 'Hendrix', 'fan', 'put', 'off', 'buying', 'concert', 'was', ""n't"", 'familiar', 'Gary', 'Moore', 'Then', 'saw', 'Moore', 'perform', '34', 'Red', 'House', '34', '34', 'Strat', 'Pack', '34', 'DVD', 'was', 'enough', 'convince', 'had', 'have', 'concert', '34', 'Strat', 'Pack', '34', 'DVD', 'apparently', 'no', 'longer', 'available', 'Region', '1', 'Video', 'sharp', 'clear', 'special', 'effects', 'sound', 'well', 'balanced', 'consistent', 'volume', 'Moore', 'ability', 'play', '34', 'Hendrix', 'style', '34', 'phenominal', 'When', 'Mitchell', 'Cox', 'join', 'Moore', 'last', 'few', 'songs', 'chemistry', 'fantastic', 'fact', 'enable', 'Moore', 'stretch', 'higher', 'level', 'playing.Dislikes', 'concert', 'was', 'too', 'short', 'Band', 'Gypsys', 'appear', 'only', 'last', 'few', 'songs', 'not', 'Moore', 'band', 'bad', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'two', 'whole', 'concerts-', 'one', 'band.This', 'DVD', 'motivated', 'search', 'Moore', 'other', 'works', 'revisit', 'other', 'artists', 'covering', 'Hendrix', 'material']",N/A

1572138,A2BJAET1P9QUGZ,B008NR90HQ,Baberufus,"[2, 2]","This DVD proves just how versatile a player Gary Moore was. Gary was one of the finest blues-rock guitarists who ever lived, leaving behind a staggering legacy of recordings to document his own greatness--he had no need to make tribute albums to other guitarists. But the fact that he did just shows his great character in showing respect to the masters before him. First there was the ""Blues for Greeny"" album dedicated to the great Peter Green, and now the Hendrix tribute DVD/album, ""Blues For Jimi"". As with the Green tribute album, Gary really nails the spirit and technique of the original master, and fittingly throws in some of his famed ""blueshredding"" for added effect here on this DVD! Great stuff! At first, he's playing a Strat with no whammy bar, and I thought, ""Oh man, he's not going to use a whammy?!"" But I should have had faith, as pretty soon, he grabs another Strat with a whammy, and boy, does he know how to use it! Jimi would be proud!His rhythm section is also dynamite and excellent musicians in their own right. For an added treat, though, they give up their spaces to allow the legendary Mitch Mitchell and Billy Cox to come out and jam with Gary for 3 numbers...fantastic! Actually, poor Mitch has trouble keeping up with the pace on one number, but still, what a thrill to see the actual '70 Hendrix rhythm section go at it again after nearly 40 years!One non-musical aspect I couldn't really figure out was Gary's apparent hostile attitude toward the crowd...lol. At one point during ""Foxy Lady"", I believe, on one of the breaks where everything stops and he normally would say, ""Foxy Lady!"", he instead sneers, ""Hey, f-- off, you!"" Was someone heckling him?? And then when Billy and Mitch are onstage, after playing a number, Billy says to the crowd, ""We love ya!"", and Gary pipes in, ""I Don't!...well, maybe some of you.""

1572142,A3JV7KL1ECLZB8,B008NR90HQ,I. Giles,"[0, 0]","This recording was made in what seem to be almost informal conditions at the London Hippodrome in 2007. The informality is underlined, not only by Gary's pleasantly laid-back approach to the audience and to his own performance, but also because of the frequent sights of the recording technicians behind the players but still 'in shot'. Rumour has it that this recording was made more as a private recording for Gary rather than as a full-blown commercial venture. If this really was a non-commercial venture initially then we can count ourselves very lucky indeed that it was made, that it is as good as it is technically and that it has been released for general consumption.Gary was one of the finest guitarists of his generation and had a particularly high regard for the work of Jimi Hendrix. It is arguable that he was probably the only guitarist capable of such a tribute at the time and what we are able to share here is an absolutely authentic Hendrix sound but with the added advantage of a far superior recording quality than was possible in Jimi's own lifetime.The concert starts with the iconic Purple Haze then works its way through a further 12 numbers before Gary concludes with the comment that he doesn't know any more to perform! We should not complain as this is a generous selection running for some 74 minutes and delivers high musical quality throughout. The style of performance is that of modest concentration demonstrating Gary Moore's obvious personal respect for the music of Hendrix. Two members of the Jimi Hendrix Experience, Mitch Mitchell on drums and Billy Cox on guitar, join Gary for a couple of numbers towards the end. No-one would guess that this was achieved with the minimum of rehearsal time.In conclusion therefore, this is a fine tribute to one ground-breaking guitarist by another fine guitarist and which is presented simply and modestly and with obvious respect and enjoyment. The recording is visually fine enough to convey the atmosphere of the occasion and is presented in enjoyable quality of both DTS surround and stereo sound. It should give followers of both Jimi Hendrix and Gary Moore great satisfaction and on that basis, this unique concert can safely be rated as a 5 star release.",5,A fine tribute by one fine guitarist to another and granted an enjoyable recording to match,1349136000,"10 2, 2012",2012,2239,"['recording', 'was', 'made', 'what', 'seem', 'be', 'almost', 'informal', 'conditions', 'London', 'Hippodrome', '2007', 'informality', 'underlined', 'not', 'only', 'Gary', 'pleasantly', 'laid-back', 'approach', 'audience', 'own', 'performance', 'also', 'frequent', 'sights', 'recording', 'technicians', 'players', 'still', ""'in"", 'shot', 'Rumour', 'recording', 'was', 'made', 'more', 'private', 'recording', 'Gary', 'rather', 'full-blown', 'commercial', 'venture', 'really', 'was', 'non-commercial', 'venture', 'initially', 'then', 'can', 'count', 'very', 'lucky', 'indeed', 'was', 'made', 'as', 'good', 'technically', 'been', 'released', 'general', 'consumption.Gary', 'was', 'one', 'finest', 'guitarists', 'generation', 'had', 'particularly', 'high', 'regard', 'work', 'Jimi', 'Hendrix', 'arguable', 'was', 'probably', 'only', 'guitarist', 'capable', 'such', 'tribute', 'time', 'what', 'are', 'able', 'share', 'here', 'absolutely', 'authentic', 'Hendrix', 'sound', 'added', 'advantage', 'far', 'superior', 'recording', 'quality', 'was', 'possible', 'Jimi', 'own', 'lifetime.The', 'concert', 'iconic', 'Purple', 'Haze', 'then', 'way', 'further', '12', 'numbers', 'Gary', 'concludes', 'comment', ""n't"", 'know', 'more', 'perform', 'should', 'not', 'complain', 'generous', 'selection', 'running', '74', 'minutes', 'delivers', 'high', 'musical', 'quality', 'style', 'performance', 'modest', 'concentration', 'demonstrating', 'Gary', 'Moore', 'obvious', 'personal', 'respect', 'music', 'Hendrix', 'Two', 'members', 'Jimi', 'Hendrix', 'Experience', 'Mitch', 'Mitchell', 'drums', 'Billy', 'Cox', 'guitar', 'join', 'Gary', 'couple', 'numbers', 'end', 'No-one', 'would', 'guess', 'was', 'achieved', 'minimum', 'rehearsal', 'time.In', 'conclusion', 'therefore', 'fine', 'tribute', 'one', 'ground-breaking', 'guitarist', 'fine', 'guitarist', 'presented', 'simply', 'modestly', 'obvious', 'respect', 'enjoyment', 'recording', 'visually', 'fine', 'enough', 'convey', 'atmosphere', 'occasion', 'presented', 'enjoyable', 'quality', 'DTS', 'surround', 'stereo', 'sound', 'should', 'give', 'followers', 'Jimi', 'Hendrix', 'Gary', 'Moore', 'great', 'satisfaction', 'basis', 'unique', 'concert', 'can', 'safely', 'be', 'rated', '5', 'star', 'release']",N/A

Gary looks, sings, and plays better in this DVD recorded three years previous, but released one year after the 2010 Blu Ray.  The best songs on here for me (not being super familiar with all of Hendrix's work) are ""I Don't Live Today,"" ""Fire,"" ""Red House,"" ""Hey Joe,"" and of course ""Voodoo Child.""  Kind of depressing that Mitch Mitchell and Gary both died within years following this concert (and both loosely alcohol related deaths), but they really mesh in this concert.  Gary knew how to play Jimi's style, and I really don't think they could have picked anyone better for this concert.

They never got what this concert was all about. If you are to criticize Gary Moore, then you should SRV as well as he was very influenced by Jimi...and thinking about it. I wonder what it would've been to have SRV and MOORE on stage playing these together exchanging solos. That would've been something to WATCH!!I recently got into Gary Moore because of this concert. I was well aware of who he was in the 80s as I was growing up, but he for x or y reason never punched through in America. But Im glad in Europe he had a great career and played at the prestigious Montreux Jazz Festival which is something the average rock guitarists or blues players can't say or have in their resume.GARY MOORE - BLUES FOR JIMIThis for me was a night of MAGIC. All the elements aligned and Gary was able to tackle with the same fire a lot of the Guitar effects Jimi used to do. Besides that, I love his guitar tone which is huge. I wish this concert would've been longer because it leaves you wanting for me. Wonder if MACHINE GUN would've been played on here what would've happened or POWER OF LOVE from BAND OF GYPSYS because we had BILLY COX on bass and MITCH MITCHELL who, by the way had a very very good chemistry playing with Gary Moore. You can tell BILLY COX was very impressed by MOORE by the body language on stage.I am looking forward for more DVDS or recordings from GARY because again, he was treated by the wayside in America but before you judge Gary Moore, watch this or get some of his cds like BAD FOR YOU BABY or BLUES ALIVE. He was the Irish Blues master in every sense of the word and I wish I would've gotten into his playing years ago, not now after his passing.For me to make a strong statement is for a reason but ""ALL THE PLANETS ALIGNED THIS EVENING"" when this concert took place. We are very lucky to say the least that we have this on video.Again, the only other one I could picture doing this would've been SRV because if John Bonamassa who is mentioned every 10 mins wouldve been at this concert, Gary would've chopped him with a chainsaw musically and possibly had to walk off stage.It is amazing that after 43 years after his passing the name JIMI HENDRIX is still a name that is mentioned in the Guitar World. I guess we can proudly say he was LIGHT YEARS ahead of his time.HENDRIX will live in the hearts of us for eternity and we were lucky to say the least that this concert was filmed capturing all the fire and fury that Jimi had, now captured by Gary Moore. Many times, it felt like Gary was channeling Jimi Hendrix at this show.RATING 20RAY ST JOHN",5,BLUES FOR JIMI - A NIGHT OF MAGIC,1366588800,"04 22, 2013",2013,2663,"['read', 'negative', 'reviews', 'FEEL', 'very', 'sorry', 'people', 'own', 'never', 'got', 'what', 'concert', 'was', 'are', 'criticize', 'Gary', 'Moore', 'then', 'should', 'SRV', 'as', 'well', 'was', 'very', 'influenced', 'Jimi', 'thinking', 'wonder', 'what', 'would', ""'ve"", 'been', 'have', 'SRV', 'MOORE', 'stage', 'playing', 'together', 'exchanging', 'solos', 'would', ""'ve"", 'been', 'something', 'WATCH', 'recently', 'got', 'Gary', 'Moore', 'concert', 'was', 'well', 'aware', 'who', 'was', '80s', 'was', 'growing', 'up', 'x', 'y', 'reason', 'never', 'punched', 'America', 'Im', 'glad', 'Europe', 'had', 'great', 'career', 'played', 'prestigious', 'Montreux', 'Jazz', 'Festival', 'something', 'average', 'rock', 'guitarists', 'blues', 'players', 'ca', ""n't"", 'say', 'have', 'resume.GARY', 'MOORE', 'BLUES', 'FOR', 'JIMIThis', 'was', 'night', 'MAGIC', 'elements', 'aligned', 'Gary', 'was', 'able', 'tackle', 'same', 'fire', 'lot', 'Guitar', 'effects', 'Jimi', 'used', 'do', 'love', 'guitar', 'tone', 'huge', 'wish', 'concert', 'would', ""'ve"", 'been', 'longer', 'wanting', 'Wonder', 'MACHINE', 'GUN', 'would', ""'ve"", 'been', 'played', 'here', 'what', 'would', ""'ve"", 'happened', 'POWER', 'OF', 'LOVE', 'BAND', 'OF', 'GYPSYS', 'had', 'BILLY', 'COX', 'bass', 'MITCH', 'MITCHELL', 'who', 'way', 'had', 'very', 'very', 'good', 'chemistry', 'playing', 'Gary', 'Moore', 'can', 'tell', 'BILLY', 'COX', 'was', 'very', 'impressed', 'MOORE', 'body', 'language', 'stage.I', 'am', 'looking', 'forward', 'more', 'DVDS', 'recordings', 'GARY', 'because', 'again', 'was', 'treated', 'wayside', 'America', 'judge', 'Gary', 'Moore', 'watch', 'get', 'cds', 'BAD', 'FOR', 'YOU', 'BABY', 'BLUES', 'ALIVE', 'was', 'Irish', 'Blues', 'master', 'sense', 'word', 'wish', 'would', ""'ve"", 'gotten', 'playing', 'years', 'ago', 'not', 'now', 'passing.For', 'make', 'strong', 'statement', 'reason', 'PLANETS', 'ALIGNED', 'THIS', 'EVENING', 'when', 'concert', 'took', 'place', 'are', 'very', 'lucky', 'say', 'least', 'have', 'video.Again', 'only', 'other', 'one', 'could', 'picture', 'doing', 'would', ""'ve"", 'been', 'SRV', 'John', 'Bonamassa', 'who', 'mentioned', '10', 'mins', 'wouldve', 'been', 'concert', 'Gary', 'would', ""'ve"", 'chopped', 'chainsaw', 'musically', 'possibly', 'had', 'walk', 'off', 'stage.It', 'amazing', '43', 'years', 'passing', 'name', 'JIMI', 'HENDRIX', 'still', 'name', 'mentioned', 'Guitar', 'World', 'guess', 'can', 'proudly', 'say', 'was', 'LIGHT', 'YEARS', 'ahead', 'time.HENDRIX', 'will', 'live', 'hearts', 'eternity', 'were', 'lucky', 'say', 'least', 'concert', 'was', 'filmed', 'capturing', 'fire', 'fury', 'Jimi', 'had', 'now', 'captured', 'Gary', 'Moore', 'Many', 'times', 'felt', 'Gary', 'was', 'channeling', 'Jimi', 'Hendrix', 'show.RATING', '20RAY', 'ST', 'JOHN']",N/A

My favorite Gary Moore blu ray is the tribute to Phil LynottGary Moore & Friends: One Night in Dublin - A Tribute to Phil Lynott [Blu-ray] and even his last show at MontreuxLive at Montreux 2010 [Blu-ray] I would suggest before this if you do not own. If you do own those and are a fan.... there is no reason not to enjoy this rip roaring tribute to Jimi Hendrix.Gary Moore plays a couple of strats and even a flying V in his tribute and I do prefer the sound of his strats on this program. The few songs where he is joined by original Experience drummer Mitch Mitchell and Band of Gypsies bass player Billy Cox (Red House, Stone Free, and Hey Joe) are particular highlights for me.As far as rating it 5 stars...well that is because I love Gary Moore's playing and musicality and miss him and plead for more to be released. If I were to be brutally honest I could knock a star off just because there are 5 star DVDs which have better/longer shows, backstage interviews and bonus tracks and I normally reserve 5 stars for such overwhelming values but  Gary Moore's flying fingers and passion puts the extra star on this for me.",5,More Moore on Blu Ray is always 5 stars for me....,1348531200,"09 25, 2012",2012,1299,"['Even', 'program', 'only', '74', 'minutes', 'stage', 'obviously', 'not', 'arranged', 'photo', 'elegance', 'when', 'Gary', 'Moore', 'guitar', 'always', 'view', 'listen', 'favorite', 'Gary', 'Moore', 'blu', 'ray', 'tribute', 'Phil', 'LynottGary', 'Moore', 'Friends', 'One', 'Night', 'Dublin', 'Tribute', 'Phil', 'Lynott', '[', 'Blu-ray', ']', 'even', 'last', 'show', 'MontreuxLive', 'Montreux', '2010', '[', 'Blu-ray', ']', 'would', 'suggest', 'do', 'not', 'own', 'do', 'own', 'are', 'fan', 'reason', 'not', 'enjoy', 'rip', 'roaring', 'tribute', 'Jimi', 'Hendrix.Gary', 'Moore', 'couple', 'strats', 'even', 'flying', 'V', 'tribute', 'do', 'prefer', 'sound', 'strats', 'program', 'few', 'songs', 'where', 'joined', 'original', 'Experience', 'drummer', 'Mitch', 'Mitchell', 'Band', 'Gypsies', 'bass', 'player', 'Billy', 'Cox', 'Red', 'House', 'Stone', 'Free', 'Hey', 'Joe', 'are', 'particular', 'highlights', 'me.As', 'far', 'rating', '5', 'stars', 'well', 'love', 'Gary', 'Moore', 'playing', 'musicality', 'miss', 'plead', 'more', 'be', 'released', 'were', 'be', 'brutally', 'honest', 'could', 'knock', 'star', 'off', 'just', 'are', '5', 'star', 'DVDs', 'have', 'better/longer', 'shows', 'backstage', 'interviews', 'bonus', 'tracks', 'normally', 'reserve', '5', 'stars', 'such', 'overwhelming', 'values', 'Gary', 'Moore', 'flying', 'fingers', 'passion', 'extra', 'star']",N/A
