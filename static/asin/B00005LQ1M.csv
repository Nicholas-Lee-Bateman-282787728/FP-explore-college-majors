That said, it is still a problem that no slow warm-up is provided, and this is essential with aerobics.  The instructor jumps right in at 80MPH, and this is a mistake.  Other than that, I am happy with it, use it frequently, and would recommend it to anyone looking for a good basic aerobic workout.",4,"""Give It Time!""",1140739200,"02 24, 2006",2006,652,"['When', 'purchased', 'DVD', 'would', 'have', 'wholeheartedly', 'agreed', 'previous', 'reviewer', 'Squirrely', 'Girl', 'something', 'compelled', 'give', 'chance', 'so', 'stuck', 'week', 'two', 'found', 'was', 'catching', 'was', 'remembering', 'following', 'routine', 'was', 'actually', 'providing', 'pretty', 'good', 'aerobic', 'workout', 'said', 'still', 'problem', 'slow', 'warm-up', 'provided', 'essential', 'aerobics', 'instructor', 'jumps', 'right', '80MPH', 'mistake', 'Other', 'am', 'happy', 'use', 'frequently', 'would', 'recommend', 'anyone', 'looking', 'good', 'basic', 'aerobic', 'workout']",N/A

I would consider myself an intermediate exerciser but I wasn't one when I first purchased the tape.I found Gay Gasper to be a very pleasant instructor and she has excellent cueing.  She is very motivating and is one of the reasons that I will keep this tape in my library.  I didn't find the moves complicated and Gay does provide a 12 minute aerobic session where by she explains each of the aerobic moves.  So I am not sure why some reviewers had trouble doing the basic moves.  Gay suggests that you do the 12 minute session before the 38 minute ""Feel The Heat"" workout.  This will provide a 50 minute workout.I've had this workout for several years and frequently use the workout in my exericse rotation.",5,I own this dvd and LOVE the workout!!,1207094400,"04 2, 2008",2008,854,"['purchased', 'VHS', 'version', 'workout', 'few', 'years', 'back', 'When', 'discovered', 'was', 'available', 'DVD', 'immediately', 'purchased', 'DVD', 'would', 'consider', 'intermediate', 'exerciser', 'was', ""n't"", 'one', 'when', 'first', 'purchased', 'tape.I', 'found', 'Gay', 'Gasper', 'be', 'very', 'pleasant', 'instructor', 'excellent', 'cueing', 'very', 'motivating', 'one', 'reasons', 'will', 'keep', 'tape', 'library', 'did', ""n't"", 'find', 'moves', 'complicated', 'Gay', 'provide', '12', 'minute', 'aerobic', 'session', 'where', 'aerobic', 'moves', 'So', 'am', 'not', 'sure', 'why', 'reviewers', 'had', 'trouble', 'doing', 'basic', 'moves', 'Gay', 'do', '12', 'minute', 'session', '38', 'minute', 'Feel', 'Heat', 'workout', 'will', 'provide', '50', 'minute', 'workout.I', ""'ve"", 'had', 'workout', 'several', 'years', 'frequently', 'use', 'workout', 'exericse', 'rotation']",N/A
664716,A2W30R08QPWM4M,B00005LQ1M,"Minnesota Raven ""Viking Vixen""","[66, 67]",I am a veteran of many an exercise tape and many years of taking aerobics classes.  Because I crave variety I have all sorts of exercise tapes in my collection but not many that feature just plain ole low impact aerobics so when I cam across this one and read the back of the video cover it seemed liked a good one to add to the collection.  When initially reviewing the tape I was sort of disappointed.  It looked so easy.  The instructor was going through each of the moves that would be used in later combos as part of the warmup.  They were all so easy and things I had learned years ago.  But as I watched the tape I did note that her form was excellent and it was actually kind of nice to only have to focus on a single person who you know is doing the exercise the correct way.  Sometimes the people in some of these exercise videos are not actually showing good form and it's annoying when the camera focuses on them during a critical changeover or difficult move.  Another plus is that during one of the four routines in the corner there is the same instructor showing you the high impact version of the exact exercise.I put the tape away at first and did not add it to my rotation.  A few months later I was coming off an illness and wanted something to gradually get me back into the swing of things.  I chose this tape and what a surprise.  Yes the moves are all basic and very easy but they work.  I always try to wear a heart rate monitor when I exercise to monitor the effectiveness of any exercise I am doing.  This has been invaluable.  Given that I was coming off an illness it didn't take long for me to get my heart rate up doing this tape and I also found that I couldn't finish the last combo.  I was baffled and a little put out that what appeared to be such an easy tape had stumped me.  A week later when I was feeling like my old self I did the tape again and while I could finish the tape easily this time I still was able to get my heart rate into the correct target zone.  I believe this tape is effective because someone has taken the time to involve all the major mucsle groups in such a way that not only requires a great deal of energy expediture but that keeps the moves simple.  You are also given enough options to make this work for anyone.  Feel like more energy on certain moves then do the high impact version.  It's that simple.  Because I have so many tapes it takes me awhile to cylce back to any one particular one but this one definitely got added to the &quot;A&quot; list.  While it's not anyhwere near the most exciting routine I have ever tried it does the job and that's what counts.  Another bonus is if you are a beginner to exercise it gives some great workout tips and bust some of the more common exercise myths/,4,"Basic, easy and a real fat burner.",1022025600,"05 22, 2002",2002,2767,"['am', 'veteran', 'many', 'exercise', 'tape', 'many', 'years', 'taking', 'aerobics', 'classes', 'crave', 'variety', 'have', 'sorts', 'exercise', 'tapes', 'collection', 'not', 'many', 'feature', 'just', 'plain', 'ole', 'low', 'impact', 'aerobics', 'when', 'cam', 'one', 'read', 'back', 'video', 'cover', 'seemed', 'liked', 'good', 'one', 'add', 'collection', 'When', 'initially', 'reviewing', 'tape', 'was', 'sort', 'disappointed', 'looked', 'so', 'easy', 'instructor', 'was', 'going', 'moves', 'would', 'be', 'used', 'later', 'combos', 'part', 'warmup', 'were', 'so', 'easy', 'things', 'had', 'learned', 'years', 'ago', 'watched', 'tape', 'did', 'note', 'form', 'was', 'excellent', 'was', 'actually', 'kind', 'nice', 'only', 'have', 'focus', 'single', 'person', 'who', 'know', 'doing', 'exercise', 'correct', 'way', 'people', 'exercise', 'videos', 'are', 'not', 'actually', 'showing', 'good', 'form', 'annoying', 'when', 'camera', 'critical', 'changeover', 'difficult', 'move', 'one', 'four', 'routines', 'corner', 'same', 'instructor', 'showing', 'high', 'impact', 'version', 'exact', 'exercise.I', 'put', 'tape', 'away', 'first', 'did', 'not', 'add', 'rotation', 'few', 'months', 'later', 'was', 'coming', 'off', 'illness', 'wanted', 'something', 'gradually', 'get', 'back', 'swing', 'things', 'chose', 'tape', 'what', 'surprise', 'Yes', 'moves', 'are', 'basic', 'very', 'easy', 'work', 'always', 'try', 'wear', 'heart', 'rate', 'monitor', 'when', 'exercise', 'monitor', 'effectiveness', 'exercise', 'am', 'doing', 'been', 'invaluable', 'Given', 'was', 'coming', 'off', 'illness', 'did', ""n't"", 'take', 'long', 'get', 'heart', 'rate', 'up', 'doing', 'tape', 'also', 'found', 'could', ""n't"", 'finish', 'last', 'combo', 'was', 'baffled', 'little', 'put', 'out', 'what', 'appeared', 'be', 'such', 'easy', 'tape', 'had', 'stumped', 'week', 'later', 'when', 'was', 'feeling', 'old', 'self', 'did', 'tape', 'again', 'could', 'finish', 'tape', 'easily', 'time', 'still', 'was', 'able', 'get', 'heart', 'rate', 'correct', 'target', 'zone', 'believe', 'tape', 'effective', 'someone', 'taken', 'time', 'involve', 'major', 'mucsle', 'groups', 'such', 'way', 'not', 'only', 'great', 'deal', 'energy', 'expediture', 'moves', 'simple', 'are', 'also', 'given', 'enough', 'options', 'make', 'work', 'anyone', 'Feel', 'more', 'energy', 'certain', 'moves', 'then', 'do', 'high', 'impact', 'version', 'simple', 'have', 'so', 'many', 'tapes', 'cylce', 'back', 'one', 'particular', 'one', 'one', 'definitely', 'got', 'added', 'quot', 'A', 'quot', 'list', 'not', 'anyhwere', 'most', 'exciting', 'routine', 'have', 'ever', 'tried', 'job', 'what', 'bonus', 'are', 'beginner', 'exercise', 'great', 'workout', 'tips', 'bust', 'more', 'common', 'exercise', 'myths/']",N/A
664717,A4PI4DZJSVF6Q,B00005LQ1M,Miss B,"[3, 3]","I have a new favorite workout.  Gay Gasper is one of the best instructors I have ever encountered.  She's cheerful (not at all annoying) and cues almost perfectly; i.e. she tells you the move before you do it and mirrors you.  As for the routine, it might be just a little bit fast moving for a person who has never done aerobics before, but the moves are easy enough that anyone should be able to catch on after a few tries.  She really does break the moves down well at the very beginning and everything is repeated often in the different combinations.  If you've done a couple of aerobic videos or classes, you'll have no problem with this.  Honestly, the moves aren't really any different from a typical Leslie Sansone workout:  sidesteps, grapevines, ham curls, knee ups, etc. Relatively low difficulty does not mean you won't sweat, though!  Gay really keeps you moving.  Plus, all through the workout there are high impact modifiers shown so that this is a workout you can easily grow with.  And you could always add weighted gloves to kick up the intensity a notch.So, to sum up: Gay is one of the best instructors out there, and for her to do a ""beginners"" workout is such a treat.  The routines may take a little bit of work for some, but they are fun and basic and worth the effort.  The music is good, though a little quiet.  It is a workout you can grow with, thanks to the modifiers shown.  And, finally, the ""Dummies"" pop-ups I've heard about are not nearly as annoying as I expected.  Once I got into the zone, they faded into the background and I hardly noticed them.  I was smiling the entire time, worked up a great sweat, and look forward to my next workout!I highly recommend this DVD to beginners to low intermediates.  Anyone higher than that might get bored with the basic choreography, but that's exactly what I love about this workout!",5,"Expect a lot of fun, but maybe not instant mastery",1201996800,"02 3, 2008",2008,1861,"['have', 'new', 'favorite', 'workout', 'Gay', 'Gasper', 'one', 'best', 'instructors', 'have', 'ever', 'encountered', 'cheerful', 'not', 'annoying', 'almost', 'perfectly', 'i.e', 'move', 'do', 'mirrors', 'routine', 'might', 'be', 'just', 'little', 'bit', 'fast', 'moving', 'person', 'who', 'never', 'done', 'aerobics', 'moves', 'are', 'easy', 'enough', 'anyone', 'should', 'be', 'able', 'catch', 'few', 'tries', 'really', 'break', 'moves', 'down', 'well', 'very', 'beginning', 'everything', 'repeated', 'often', 'different', 'combinations', ""'ve"", 'done', 'couple', 'aerobic', 'videos', 'classes', ""'ll"", 'have', 'problem', 'Honestly', 'moves', 'are', ""n't"", 'really', 'different', 'typical', 'Leslie', 'Sansone', 'workout', 'sidesteps', 'grapevines', 'ham', 'curls', 'knee', 'ups', 'etc', 'Relatively', 'low', 'difficulty', 'not', 'mean', 'wo', ""n't"", 'sweat', 'Gay', 'really', 'moving', 'workout', 'are', 'high', 'impact', 'modifiers', 'shown', 'so', 'workout', 'can', 'easily', 'grow', 'could', 'always', 'add', 'weighted', 'gloves', 'kick', 'up', 'intensity', 'notch.So', 'sum', 'up', 'Gay', 'one', 'best', 'instructors', 'out', 'there', 'do', 'beginners', 'workout', 'such', 'treat', 'routines', 'may', 'take', 'little', 'bit', 'work', 'are', 'fun', 'basic', 'worth', 'effort', 'music', 'good', 'little', 'quiet', 'workout', 'can', 'grow', 'thanks', 'modifiers', 'shown', 'finally', 'Dummies', 'pop-ups', ""'ve"", 'heard', 'are', 'not', 'nearly', 'as', 'annoying', 'expected', 'Once', 'got', 'zone', 'faded', 'background', 'hardly', 'noticed', 'was', 'smiling', 'entire', 'time', 'worked', 'up', 'great', 'sweat', 'look', 'forward', 'next', 'workout', 'highly', 'recommend', 'DVD', 'beginners', 'low', 'intermediates', 'Anyone', 'higher', 'might', 'get', 'bored', 'basic', 'choreography', 'exactly', 'what', 'love', 'workout']",N/A

I am 53 years old and weigh 192 pounds. I feel that Gay has a pleasant voice tone and instructed well throughout the session.

She starts the session by going through each move individually and then she combines them for her Fat Burning session. It gets intense, but I found it easy to follow for the most part. Yes, I got confused at times. I think anyone would get mixed up with any aerobics routine. But, you just step back into place and keep going.

This workout is really the exception. At first it all seems very simple and you are required to march, do a V-step, easily do a heel dig, then do some knee lifts, a step touch and a grapevine. Then onwards to a ham curl, mambo and jazz square. The pace is slow and you can keep up with most of the moves if you are an intermediate or beginner. Then the chaos ensues. I say this because the rest of the DVD is almost impossible to follow. There are a number of combos which incorporate what you've already learned. This should be easy right? I found the combos to be very difficult to follow and I've done a lot of aerobics videos in my life. The footwork was extremely challenging for me to the point that I gave up after thirty minutes.
