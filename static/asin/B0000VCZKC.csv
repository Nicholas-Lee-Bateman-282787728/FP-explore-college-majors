Obviously, we don't always. Anyway, I watched it and... well, it was just kind of there. The film uses a narrative device that rarely ever works and this movie was no exception. Periodically, our main little hero man (played by Seann William Scot) will pause in his conversations, turn to the camera and give a little narration to the viewer. Okay, nothing new (remember Ferris Bueller?) except that it just didn't work. It was a device used too infrequently, or just plain incorrectly in many cases. Instead of having an impact, it came out as just stupid and banal. Indeed, at the very end, where all the loose bits are being wrapped up, Seann's character (I can't remember his name now) does not do his 'look into the camera and talk to the veiwer' bit, instead it's just a voice over narrative. WHY? You already introduced the device, why not use it? Are you suddenly scared of it, or maybe realized, too late, that it wasn't a good idea in the first place? I personally HATE narration except in the rare circumstance where it actually works. This film seemed to be aimed at the younger male crowd, the kids about 15 or 16 who wish they could get into clubs and into a hot girl's pants. Now, don't get me wrong, it had its moments of levity and cleverness. Some of the supporting characters were slightly interesting, there were a few good lines here and there. It was a diamond in the rough; someone was cutting his teeth on this movie. Maybe more than one person. I felt the whole thing a little forced... just enough to make me feel uncomfortable, like I wasn't really invited to be there. An outsider looking in and eavesdropping, but not included. This is really not the way you want your audience to react to your film. The movie was trying too hard to be cool. It needs to learn to love itself for who it is, not what it thinks people want it to be.",3,"It's all right, I suppose.",1086134400,"06 2, 2004",2004,2002,"['was', 'pretty', 'hyped', 'see', 'movie', 'friends', 'who', 'had', 'bought', 'liked', 'lot', 'tend', 'have', 'same', 'taste', 'movies', 'TEND', 'Obviously', 'do', ""n't"", 'always', 'Anyway', 'watched', 'well', 'was', 'just', 'kind', 'there', 'film', 'narrative', 'device', 'rarely', 'ever', 'movie', 'was', 'exception', 'Periodically', 'main', 'little', 'hero', 'man', 'played', 'Seann', 'William', 'Scot', 'will', 'pause', 'conversations', 'turn', 'camera', 'give', 'little', 'narration', 'viewer', 'Okay', 'nothing', 'new', 'remember', 'Ferris', 'Bueller', 'just', 'did', ""n't"", 'work', 'was', 'device', 'used', 'too', 'infrequently', 'just', 'plain', 'incorrectly', 'many', 'cases', 'Instead', 'having', 'impact', 'came', 'out', 'just', 'stupid', 'banal', 'Indeed', 'very', 'end', 'where', 'loose', 'bits', 'are', 'being', 'wrapped', 'up', 'Seann', 'character', 'ca', ""n't"", 'remember', 'name', 'now', 'not', 'do', ""'look"", 'camera', 'talk', 'veiwer', 'bit', 'instead', 'just', 'voice', 'narrative', 'WHY', 'already', 'introduced', 'device', 'why', 'not', 'use', 'Are', 'suddenly', 'scared', 'maybe', 'realized', 'too', 'late', 'was', ""n't"", 'good', 'idea', 'first', 'place', 'personally', 'HATE', 'narration', 'rare', 'circumstance', 'where', 'actually', 'film', 'seemed', 'be', 'aimed', 'younger', 'male', 'crowd', 'kids', '15', '16', 'who', 'wish', 'could', 'get', 'clubs', 'hot', 'girl', 'pants', 'Now', 'do', ""n't"", 'get', 'wrong', 'had', 'moments', 'levity', 'cleverness', 'supporting', 'characters', 'were', 'slightly', 'interesting', 'were', 'few', 'good', 'lines', 'here', 'there', 'was', 'diamond', 'rough', 'someone', 'was', 'cutting', 'teeth', 'movie', 'Maybe', 'more', 'one', 'person', 'felt', 'whole', 'thing', 'little', 'forced', 'just', 'enough', 'make', 'feel', 'uncomfortable', 'was', ""n't"", 'really', 'invited', 'be', 'there', 'outsider', 'looking', 'eavesdropping', 'not', 'included', 'really', 'not', 'way', 'want', 'audience', 'react', 'film', 'movie', 'was', 'trying', 'too', 'hard', 'be', 'cool', 'learn', 'love', 'who', 'not', 'what', 'people', 'want', 'be']",Stark Raving Mad

Makes one wish all those promising films that got attention and wide release were this good.This is a fun bank heist film that reminds me of the original Italian Job and Lock Stock and Two Smoking Barrels. You have to see it.BTW, someone said that the film is totaly predictable, but that's just a shallow putdown. There is nothing too predictable in this film, which is what makes it a pleasure to watch.ps. I actually liked it so much that I had to write a review, and I never do that.

Some things taste good to you, i.e. eggplant, and other things just taste terrible,i.e. plain yogurt. No explaining taste, you just go with it. This is one of those curious films that you pick up on the bottom row at the video store and for $1 for a week rental, you say,""What the hell?"" and it turns out to be very good.  It is Scott's character talking to you and his refernces to the Learning Channel that get your attention.  His buddy is so off the wall that you find yourself liking him.  Maybe it is the sex scene in the bathroom that tickles your funny bone.  BUT it could be the ""gang"" that is assemble to rob the bank and the delivery boy who just voleenters to help out that tip the movie over the edge in to quirky fun.
