Many think of it as a bad version of ""The Blair Witch Project"", it is far from it. ""The Blair Witch Project"" was shot like a home video wanting to be a movie, this film is a movie. Though the dubbing is not that great, the actors and story make up for it. The story's focus is on the little red riding hood fairy tale, and a bunch of grisly murders. As the characters drop one by one everyone is a suspect. Vincent Lecoeur ""Fredrick"" is great in his role. Watch this movie for great scenes, and acting.

668904,A1DRKVXO300RUE,B00005NKSB,Amazon Customer,"[2, 2]","This was a fairly entertaining movie that captured my interest across several fronts.  First, foremost and of most entertaining value to me was the quality of camera work.  There were some very creative camera shots/angles, and the movie did a good job of using creative photography techniques throughout the entire film.  It wasn't overused, and made this movie much more enjoyable to watch than the script alone would provide. The camera work alone motives me to check out related work.  The mood throughout was very effective.  Unlike many american thrillers/horrors, the action built very slowly, but effectively, and the use of camera angles, mood and other techniques was highly effective.  My only complaint is the story/plot; while overall pretty good and generally tight, there were a few scenes and/or specific actions that just didn't fit within the story, i.e., characters acting out of character and doing things that made no sense for them to do.  But this was generally infrequent, and is easily overlookable by the quality of camera work and mood.  The English dubbing was a little annoying too; perhaps I'm atypical, but I don't mind subtitles.  The disconnect between moving lips and actual dialogue is distracting.  All in all, I recommend it as a rental, but might not encourage a purchase w/o previously viewing.

668905,A518CRYX4QKAH,B00005NKSB,Bookworm936,"[1, 1]","A slasher who done it...it was ok considering we had nothing better to do at the time.  The movie starts off with a woman telling a bed time by a fireplace to an unseen baby in a bed then gives the unseen baby a doll.  Then the movie flashes into today's time and a small group of actors/friends gets hired by an eccentric wealthy man to perform a rendition of Little Red Riding Hood for his grandson's birthday party.  When they arrive on the premisis they are greated by an odd gamesmith who works for the man who hired them.  When they get to the house the discover the man who hired them is equally odd and also that the party consists of him and the grandson.  The man who hired them for some reason repeatedly addresses one particular member in the acting troupe as Sederic when his name is Frederic...However, the young actor continues to respond to the wrong name instead of correcting the man.  Also, the man seems to feel very comfortable with Frederic and asks him to basically tuck him into bed and read him a story....at this particular point in time I would think the Frederic character would draw the line; however, Frederic went right along with the old man.  Also, one member of the acting group if mute and bisexual and honestly I am not sure what her character is doing in the movie.  The mute bisexual doesn't appar in the performance the actors are putting on and her longest scene is when she is having sex with her girlfriend.  Apparantly, when they are having sex they are also being watched and photographed by an unidentified person.  The viewer isn't given any reason for the photography...I guess we just assume he is a pervert rapist.  The grandson, Nicholas, is also rather odd.  Nicholas doesn't really speak or have facial gestures.  Nicholas just sorta stands/sits with a blank look on his face for most of the movie.  Again, the viewer isn't given a reason as to why the child acts that way.  Also, the killer and the reason behind the killings is rather lame.  Actually, considering the death scenes the viewer can figure out that the character didn't die and there is a difference between the killer's initial death scene and the other death scenes.  So yeah we figured out the killer early on....so it wasn't very much of a who done it for us.  The character of the police officer was off, he seemed more like a young guy wanting to party than a respected officer of the law.The movie was boring in some spots and never built up any since of horror/suspense.  There were not any scares nor was there alot of gore.  The acting was pretty lackluster and the voice over in English made it worse.  The characters were lackluster and the reasoning behind their actions was rather lame.The only reason I gave it 2 stars:  I liked the setting, the views through the keyhole were rather different and the wolf costume was stylish.",2,i have seen worse...,1323302400,"12 8, 2011",2011,2859,"['slasher', 'who', 'done', 'was', 'ok', 'considering', 'had', 'nothing', 'better', 'do', 'time', 'movie', 'woman', 'telling', 'bed', 'time', 'fireplace', 'unseen', 'baby', 'bed', 'then', 'unseen', 'baby', 'doll', 'Then', 'movie', 'today', 'time', 'small', 'group', 'actors/friends', 'hired', 'eccentric', 'wealthy', 'man', 'perform', 'rendition', 'Little', 'Red', 'Riding', 'Hood', 'grandson', 'birthday', 'party', 'When', 'arrive', 'premisis', 'are', 'greated', 'odd', 'gamesmith', 'who', 'man', 'who', 'hired', 'When', 'get', 'house', 'discover', 'man', 'who', 'hired', 'equally', 'odd', 'also', 'party', 'grandson', 'man', 'who', 'hired', 'reason', 'repeatedly', 'one', 'particular', 'member', 'acting', 'troupe', 'Sederic', 'when', 'name', 'Frederic', 'However', 'young', 'actor', 'respond', 'wrong', 'name', 'instead', 'correcting', 'man', 'Also', 'man', 'feel', 'very', 'comfortable', 'Frederic', 'basically', 'tuck', 'bed', 'read', 'story', 'particular', 'point', 'time', 'would', 'think', 'Frederic', 'character', 'would', 'draw', 'line', 'however', 'Frederic', 'went', 'right', 'old', 'man', 'Also', 'one', 'member', 'acting', 'group', 'mute', 'bisexual', 'honestly', 'am', 'not', 'sure', 'what', 'character', 'doing', 'movie', 'mute', 'bisexual', ""n't"", 'appar', 'performance', 'actors', 'are', 'putting', 'longest', 'scene', 'when', 'having', 'sex', 'girlfriend', 'Apparantly', 'when', 'are', 'having', 'sex', 'are', 'also', 'being', 'watched', 'photographed', 'unidentified', 'person', 'viewer', ""n't"", 'given', 'reason', 'photography', 'guess', 'just', 'assume', 'pervert', 'rapist', 'grandson', 'Nicholas', 'also', 'rather', 'odd', 'Nicholas', ""n't"", 'really', 'speak', 'have', 'facial', 'gestures', 'Nicholas', 'just', 'sorta', 'stands/sits', 'blank', 'look', 'face', 'most', 'movie', 'Again', 'viewer', ""n't"", 'given', 'reason', 'why', 'child', 'way', 'Also', 'killer', 'reason', 'killings', 'rather', 'lame', 'Actually', 'considering', 'death', 'viewer', 'can', 'figure', 'out', 'character', 'did', ""n't"", 'die', 'difference', 'killer', 'initial', 'death', 'scene', 'other', 'death', 'scenes', 'So', 'figured', 'out', 'killer', 'early', '.so', 'was', ""n't"", 'very', 'much', 'who', 'done', 'character', 'police', 'officer', 'was', 'off', 'seemed', 'more', 'young', 'guy', 'wanting', 'party', 'respected', 'officer', 'law.The', 'movie', 'was', 'boring', 'spots', 'never', 'built', 'up', 'horror/suspense', 'were', 'not', 'scares', 'was', 'alot', 'gore', 'acting', 'was', 'pretty', 'lackluster', 'voice', 'English', 'made', 'worse', 'characters', 'were', 'lackluster', 'reasoning', 'actions', 'was', 'rather', 'lame.The', 'only', 'reason', 'gave', '2', 'stars', 'liked', 'setting', 'views', 'keyhole', 'were', 'rather', 'different', 'wolf', 'costume', 'was', 'stylish']",Deep in the Woods
668906,A51IK68MWKV5R,B00005NKSB,"Craig Clarke ""Somebody Dies""","[17, 19]","A French slasher film.  Who would've thought?  And it's quite good.To start, this thing is moody as all get out.  The one thing I kept thinking was that it most reminded me of Suspiria, and other Dario Argento films.  Probably just the European connection.The plot is simple (always a plus in this genre): five college kids drive out to an old mansion in order to put on a surreal stage version of Little Red Riding Hood for the owner's creepy son (and, boy, was this kid creepy!).  After a few tokes (and a gratuitous--although not unappreciated--Lesbian scene), they run out into the woods.  After they return to the house, they notice one hasn't come back.Then they start dying one by one.For a slasher film, this one really held my interest.  I kept wondering who was going to die next.  And who was doing the killing.  But all that doesn't really matter.  The real star here is the direction.  The moody eerieness never lets up from the beginning.  Plus, effects like the use of after-shower steam as a vision obstruction brought a novelty to a tired field.  And then there's that creepy kid.  It doesn't take much, just for the kid to stare with wide open eyes, but it works.The acting I can't really say much about.  The English was dubbed instead of subtitled (I guess this was not marketed to foreign film fans, but horror fans), so it's hard to tell whether the acting was being done by the bodies or the voices.  I was not disappointed in either, however.I would definitely recommend this for fans of Argento (or other European horror filmmakers), or anyone looking for fresh ideas in the slasher subgenre.",5,Fresh take on the genre,1018483200,"04 11, 2002",2002,1617,"['French', 'slasher', 'film', 'Who', 'would', ""'ve"", 'thought', 'quite', 'good.To', 'start', 'thing', 'moody', 'get', 'out', 'one', 'thing', 'kept', 'thinking', 'was', 'most', 'reminded', 'Suspiria', 'other', 'Dario', 'Argento', 'films', 'Probably', 'just', 'European', 'connection.The', 'plot', 'simple', 'always', 'plus', 'genre', 'five', 'college', 'kids', 'drive', 'out', 'old', 'mansion', 'order', 'put', 'surreal', 'stage', 'version', 'Little', 'Red', 'Riding', 'Hood', 'owner', 'creepy', 'son', 'boy', 'was', 'kid', 'creepy', 'few', 'tokes', 'gratuitous', 'not', 'unappreciated', 'Lesbian', 'scene', 'run', 'out', 'woods', 'return', 'house', 'notice', 'one', ""n't"", 'come', 'back.Then', 'start', 'dying', 'one', 'one.For', 'slasher', 'film', 'one', 'really', 'held', 'interest', 'kept', 'wondering', 'who', 'was', 'going', 'die', 'next', 'who', 'was', 'doing', 'killing', ""n't"", 'really', 'matter', 'real', 'star', 'here', 'direction', 'moody', 'eerieness', 'never', 'up', 'beginning', 'effects', 'use', 'after-shower', 'steam', 'vision', 'obstruction', 'brought', 'novelty', 'tired', 'field', 'then', 'creepy', 'kid', ""n't"", 'take', 'much', 'just', 'kid', 'stare', 'wide', 'open', 'eyes', 'works.The', 'acting', 'ca', ""n't"", 'really', 'say', 'much', 'English', 'was', 'dubbed', 'instead', 'subtitled', 'guess', 'was', 'not', 'marketed', 'foreign', 'film', 'fans', 'horror', 'fans', 'hard', 'tell', 'acting', 'was', 'being', 'done', 'bodies', 'voices', 'was', 'not', 'disappointed', 'however.I', 'would', 'definitely', 'recommend', 'fans', 'Argento', 'other', 'European', 'horror', 'filmmakers', 'anyone', 'looking', 'fresh', 'ideas', 'slasher', 'subgenre']",Deep in the Woods

With this point in mind, I must confess that I had high hopes for ""Deep in the Woods"".  After all, it is a European slasher flick with a different flavor to it than American horror films.  Unfortunately, ""Deep in the Woods"" is a complete dud of a horror film.  Now, let me just go on the record as also saying that ""Deep in the Woods"" is absolutely nothing like a good Argento movie or any kind of quality European horror cinema that I have seen, other than the fact that it is a ""whodunnit"" like murder mystery, but you get that in many of your garden variety American slashers anyway, so that's not saying much.  ""Deep in the Woods"" represents the kind of movie that is different, strange and weird, but that does not make it good in and of itself.  In fact, what ultimately transpired in ""Deep in the Woods"" was a lackluster and mostly incoherent and nonsensical play on the patience completely lacking in style and atmosphere.""Deep in the Woods"" is about a group of young people who are solicited to a mansion in the middle of nowhere to do a play for a traumatized child.  However, when the young people get there, they realize that they have come to a place where the strange and bizarre are the norm.  Eventually, people start dying, and a ""whodunnit"" type mystery takes form.  The killer is disguised in a wolf costume a la ""Little Red Riding Hood"" (which is a theme throughout the movie) so as to create a mystery and elicit suspense in the audience.I liked the wolf costume bit a lot for the killer, and I wish the movie had been a little more mysterious about the killer throughout the film rather than its unconvincing attempt to tidy things up with the movie's conclusion; this tactic inevitably leads to a letdown in these types of films, and ""Deep in the Woods is certainly no exception to this rule.There are virtually zero scares in ""Deep in the Woods"", and aside from the wolf-costumed killer, there really is not much in the way of horror at all.  The kills are not very impressive at all, the acting was pretty bad, and the movie just never really seemed to get off the ground.  In fact, the wooden acting in this film only worked to accentuate the lifeless screenplay that was adopted for this film.

668912,A1E8RJN1L9UMHX,B00005NKSB,IKCWMBFD,"[3, 3]","I completely missed this film when it first came out and was pleasantly surprised when I stumbled across its existence recently. I originally assumed from the Artisan DVD package design that this was yet another low budget american Scream wanna-be production and ignored it but this turns out actually to be a quite satisfying french (belgian?) Scream wanna-be production. For me, euro good, though I know there are those who don't respond well to foreign films of any sort, horror included: euro bad. But euro horror tends in my general experience to be more atmospheric and often pays much more attention to visual details and style in filmmaking than american horror (and often tries to do more with subtext); logic does tend to take a back seat to effect of course. You can tell right off from the first sequence that there is a strong Argento influence in this film, and I spotted various references, perhaps intentional tributes or maybe just unconscious influences, throughout to lots of euro horror classics.The main reason to watch this film is in the execution; there isn't anything here you haven't seen before but it's done much better here than usual. For anybody who values storytelling technique in horror films, you should find much to your liking here. The suspense is built very nicely and some of the deaths are first rate in my view. The actors are generally pretty appealing and there is a refreshing lack of comedy and irony in this movie. Rather, in springboarding off the little red riding hood tale, the film tries to go for a more serious dream-nightmare fable feel. My problem with comedy and irony in horror these days is that it tends to mean that the filmmakers are making excuses for themselves, building in a defense against criticism, rather than trying hard. (You mean you took us seriously? But it's all just a joke these kinds of movies, don't you know.)  The ending is a bit too positive for my tastes, as tends to be the case nowadays, so I am docking it a star, sorry to say.I strongly recommend that you watch this movie widescreen (in the dark of course) and go with the subtitled french audio rather than the dub, which is, as usual, pretty poorly done.

The decision is made that it would be safest for everyone to stay right where they are, which is, of course, the wrong one, and the actors die one by one.

Very mysterious, with a unique strain of eerie sinister tension running throughout.  On a much less dark note, features a hot girl-on-girl scene that wins lots of bonus points for being not just a sex scene but actually a very affectionate bona fide Love Scene (albeit rather on the brief side).  Other appreciated scenery includes the lush, absolutely gorgeous forest within which the movie takes place, captured well by very fine cinematography.  Somehow placing the subtle menace in the midst of such beauty makes it seem all the more dangerous.

668919,A6VXZ1EEPRTLV,B00005NKSB,trebe,"[0, 0]","With stylish settings, obscure motivations, and a suspenseful atmosphere where not much that happens makes much sense, Deep In The Woods (2000) is a French production dubbed in English, that kind of plays out like an Argento style giallo, as a troupe of five actors journeys to an isolated house in the country to give a performance for a wealthy man and his grandson.Axel de Fersen (Francois Berleand, Inspector Tarconi from the Transporter films) owner of a fabulous estate, has hired the troupe as a surprise birthday gift for his grandson Nicholas (Thibault Truffert).  The show, a variation of Little Red Riding Hood, includes a performer in a wolf costume.  The play seems a little upsetting to young Nicholas, who seems to be in a trace or perpetual state of shock.  At dinner after the show, the boy deliberately stabs himself in the hand with a folk.  Alex tells his guests not to worry, and expresses an interest in Frederick  Vincent Lecoeur), one of the actors, inviting him to his bedroom.Not a lot is revealed about the performers.  Sophie (Clotilde Courau) and the mute Jean (Alexia Stresi), are sometime lesbian lovers, while Mathew (Clement Sibony) and Matilda (Maud Buquet) are also romantically involved, although these relationships appear to be subject to change.Weird things begin to happen, as an obnoxious cop (Michel Muller) mysteriously appears, looking for a serial rapist.  In another nonsensical turn, the members of the group are suddenly wandering in the woods, providing the opportunity for some jump scares and moonlight sex.The first kill occurs in a shower, with the killer dressed in the wolf costume.  With one of their party missing, the group also finds that their host has vanished, their car disabled, and the phone out of order.  A spectacular kill featuring a speeding arrow, sends them into a full panic.  After locking up Stefan (Denis Lavant) the estate's gamekeeper, they make plans to leave with Nicholas in de Fersen's car, but things don't go quite go as planned.Darkly atmospheric and well photographed, Deep In The Woods is scary in places, but suffers from the lack of a coherent plot.  Emphasizing style over substance, the violent and stylish kills are effective, but the various pieces don't fit together in a sensible way.  The mostly shallow characters don't behave realistically, and aren't very likeable.  The dialog is often ridiculous, and the vocal dub frequently sounds comical, and makes assessing the acting performances a little difficult.  Still, the cast seems to deliver what director Lionel Delplanque was going for.  Finishing with a flurry of dramatic kills and a big surprise reveal, the film has many of the qualities common to Italian giallos, including a creepy kid and a masked killer.  If a more modern take on the giallo genre has some appeal, you might want to give this movie a watch.",3,"a stylish, though not very coherent french take on the giallo...",1318723200,"10 16, 2011",2011,2866,"['stylish', 'settings', 'obscure', 'motivations', 'suspenseful', 'atmosphere', 'where', 'not', 'much', 'much', 'sense', 'Deep', 'Woods', '2000', 'French', 'production', 'dubbed', 'English', 'kind', 'plays', 'out', 'Argento', 'style', 'giallo', 'troupe', 'five', 'actors', 'journeys', 'isolated', 'house', 'country', 'give', 'performance', 'wealthy', 'man', 'grandson.Axel', 'Fersen', 'Francois', 'Berleand', 'Inspector', 'Tarconi', 'Transporter', 'films', 'owner', 'fabulous', 'estate', 'hired', 'troupe', 'surprise', 'birthday', 'gift', 'grandson', 'Nicholas', 'Thibault', 'Truffert', 'show', 'variation', 'Little', 'Red', 'Riding', 'Hood', 'performer', 'wolf', 'costume', 'play', 'little', 'upsetting', 'young', 'Nicholas', 'who', 'be', 'trace', 'perpetual', 'state', 'shock', 'dinner', 'show', 'boy', 'deliberately', 'stabs', 'hand', 'folk', 'Alex', 'guests', 'not', 'worry', 'interest', 'Frederick', 'Vincent', 'Lecoeur', 'one', 'actors', 'inviting', 'bedroom.Not', 'lot', 'revealed', 'performers', 'Sophie', 'Clotilde', 'Courau', 'mute', 'Jean', 'Alexia', 'Stresi', 'are', 'sometime', 'lesbian', 'lovers', 'Mathew', 'Clement', 'Sibony', 'Matilda', 'Maud', 'Buquet', 'are', 'also', 'romantically', 'involved', 'relationships', 'appear', 'be', 'subject', 'change.Weird', 'things', 'begin', 'happen', 'obnoxious', 'cop', 'Michel', 'Muller', 'mysteriously', 'looking', 'serial', 'rapist', 'nonsensical', 'turn', 'members', 'group', 'are', 'suddenly', 'wandering', 'woods', 'providing', 'opportunity', 'jump', 'scares', 'moonlight', 'sex.The', 'first', 'kill', 'occurs', 'shower', 'killer', 'dressed', 'wolf', 'costume', 'one', 'party', 'missing', 'group', 'also', 'host', 'vanished', 'car', 'disabled', 'phone', 'order', 'spectacular', 'kill', 'featuring', 'speeding', 'arrow', 'full', 'panic', 'locking', 'up', 'Stefan', 'Denis', 'Lavant', 'estate', 'gamekeeper', 'make', 'plans', 'leave', 'Nicholas', 'de', 'Fersen', 'car', 'things', 'do', ""n't"", 'go', 'quite', 'go', 'planned.Darkly', 'atmospheric', 'well', 'photographed', 'Deep', 'Woods', 'scary', 'places', 'suffers', 'lack', 'coherent', 'plot', 'Emphasizing', 'style', 'substance', 'violent', 'stylish', 'kills', 'are', 'effective', 'various', 'pieces', 'do', ""n't"", 'fit', 'together', 'sensible', 'way', 'mostly', 'shallow', 'characters', 'do', ""n't"", 'behave', 'realistically', 'are', ""n't"", 'very', 'likeable', 'dialog', 'often', 'ridiculous', 'vocal', 'dub', 'frequently', 'comical', 'assessing', 'acting', 'little', 'difficult', 'Still', 'cast', 'deliver', 'what', 'director', 'Lionel', 'Delplanque', 'was', 'going', 'Finishing', 'flurry', 'dramatic', 'kills', 'big', 'surprise', 'reveal', 'film', 'many', 'qualities', 'common', 'Italian', 'giallos', 'including', 'creepy', 'kid', 'masked', 'killer', 'more', 'modern', 'take', 'giallo', 'genre', 'appeal', 'might', 'want', 'give', 'movie', 'watch']",Deep in the Woods
