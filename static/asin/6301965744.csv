276151,AQ8DU6XVA3USJ,6301965744,"Alejandra Vernon ""artist & illustrator""","[15, 15]","Made in 1926-27 by King Vidor, with brilliant cinematography by Henry Sharp of huge crowd scenes, often with superimposed layers of film, this is a classic; beautifully acted and scripted, it is one of the best films of the silent genre.It follows the life of John Sims, born on July 4th, 1900, who is average in every way, with great hopes and dreams, struggling to make a living in New York City. Every scene is full of symbolism, representing man searching for his uniqueness among the masses, and with the eventual acceptance of himself as an individual.There are quite a few moments of comic relief (the Christmas Eve conversation with the in-laws is hilarious), but most of it is tragic; as he finds out after a death in the family, ""the crowd laughs with you always...but it will cry with you for only a day"".This was an experimental film for Vidor, and one of the many risks he took was casting an unknown actor, James Murray, to play John, and the choice was a good one. Eleanor Boardman (who was married to Vidor at the time) is marvelous as John's long suffering wife Mary. Also excellent is Bert Roach, who plays John's best buddy Bert.There is a famous camera shot early in this film, that was made with the help of a scale model, which seems as though one is going up the side of a skyscraper, through a window, and into an office. It also is a film without a heroic figure, which made the studio hesitant to release it; little did they know it would stand the test of time, and would be still seen by many, 75 years later, and appreciated as a work of cinematic art.The restoration is excellent, and it is enhanced by an orchestral score by Carl Davis.",5,waiting for the ship to come in,1052352000,"05 8, 2003",2003,1667,"['Made', '1926-27', 'King', 'Vidor', 'brilliant', 'cinematography', 'Henry', 'Sharp', 'huge', 'crowd', 'scenes', 'often', 'superimposed', 'layers', 'film', 'classic', 'beautifully', 'acted', 'scripted', 'one', 'best', 'films', 'silent', 'genre.It', 'life', 'John', 'Sims', 'born', 'July', '4th', '1900', 'who', 'average', 'way', 'great', 'hopes', 'dreams', 'struggling', 'make', 'living', 'New', 'York', 'City', 'Every', 'scene', 'full', 'symbolism', 'representing', 'man', 'searching', 'uniqueness', 'masses', 'eventual', 'acceptance', 'individual.There', 'are', 'quite', 'few', 'moments', 'comic', 'relief', 'Christmas', 'Eve', 'conversation', 'in-laws', 'hilarious', 'most', 'tragic', 'out', 'death', 'family', 'crowd', 'always', 'will', 'cry', 'only', 'day', '.This', 'was', 'experimental', 'film', 'Vidor', 'one', 'many', 'risks', 'took', 'was', 'casting', 'unknown', 'actor', 'James', 'Murray', 'play', 'John', 'choice', 'was', 'good', 'one', 'Eleanor', 'Boardman', 'who', 'was', 'married', 'Vidor', 'time', 'marvelous', 'John', 'long', 'suffering', 'wife', 'Mary', 'Also', 'excellent', 'Bert', 'Roach', 'who', 'John', 'best', 'buddy', 'Bert.There', 'famous', 'camera', 'shot', 'early', 'film', 'was', 'made', 'help', 'scale', 'model', 'one', 'going', 'up', 'side', 'skyscraper', 'window', 'office', 'also', 'film', 'heroic', 'figure', 'made', 'studio', 'hesitant', 'release', 'little', 'did', 'know', 'would', 'stand', 'test', 'time', 'would', 'be', 'still', 'seen', 'many', '75', 'years', 'later', 'appreciated', 'work', 'cinematic', 'art.The', 'restoration', 'excellent', 'enhanced', 'orchestral', 'score', 'Carl', 'Davis']",N/A
276152,A62G4QX6XQVLP,6301965744,Anyechka,"[5, 5]","This is one of those films that just about everyone seems to love and praise as a classic, even if they might not ordinarily be fans of the genre or the people involved in it, and it's definitely one of the Top 10 films of the silent era.  While it's not one of the great epic silents such as 'Ben-Hur' or 'The Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse,' it can be seen as an epic in its own way, the epic story of an individual's life.John Sims is born on the Fourth of July in the first year of the 20th century, and his father, quite proud of his new son, is sure that he's going to grow up to be someone great.  And throughout much of his life, John does believe that, even as life keeps handing him one rotten turn after another.  He knows he's going to be someone, more than just another anonymous face in the crowd, that his big break really is just around the corner this time, that everything will start to go swimmingly before he knows it.  While he's, on close analysis, not really a particularly likeable or ambitious character, that's part of the appeal of the story, and of his character.  He's just like so many of us, starting out believing he would be something great, really make something of himself, automatically climb the ladder of success, and even when life hands him lemons, he keeps persisting in his belief that it's not going to be like this forever, that his whole life couldn't really be wasted and nothing more than squandered missed opportunities.  After all, he's done well in school, gets a job at as good company, scores a wife lightning-fast (his seemingly first dating experience ends with an impulsive marriage proposal based on a subway advertisement for a house he catches sight of!), and despite some marital problems (many based on his in-laws' disapproval of him), establishes what he thinks is a good home life with two good kids.  His big chance to make something of himself really does seem to him to be only a matter of time.  His story is captivating and incredibly real to life, becoming even more so the further he sinks.  It is a depressing story, but many times real life is depressing and has no real happy ending.This film was made when the silent cinema was at its peak, such an evolution in comparison to some of the films from even five years earlier.  This story would never have worked nearly so well had it been made as a talking picture.  All of its power, beauty, emotions, pull, and nuances would have been lost.  Among the great scenes and shots illustrating the power of silence to tell a story are the camera panning up the skyscraper, the shot of all of the desks in the huge office John works at, the scene on the train during John and Mary's first night together as a married couple (the fear and nervousness over how they're going to have to sleep in the same bed for the first time is portrayed incredibly realistically), twelve year old John at the top of the stairs upon learning his father has died, and the haunting final shot, truly one of the most memorable endings in all of cinema.  It's difficult to understand why this, one of the greatest of all silents, has never been issued on DVD, while numerous lesser silents have been merited worthy of DVD treatment.",5,What an amazing experience,1195862400,"11 24, 2007",2007,3229,"['one', 'films', 'just', 'everyone', 'love', 'praise', 'classic', 'even', 'might', 'not', 'ordinarily', 'be', 'fans', 'genre', 'people', 'involved', 'definitely', 'one', 'Top', '10', 'films', 'silent', 'era', 'not', 'one', 'great', 'epic', 'silents', 'such', ""'Ben-Hur"", ""'The"", 'Four', 'Horsemen', 'Apocalypse', 'can', 'be', 'seen', 'epic', 'own', 'way', 'epic', 'story', 'individual', 'life.John', 'Sims', 'born', 'Fourth', 'July', 'first', 'year', '20th', 'century', 'father', 'quite', 'proud', 'new', 'son', 'sure', 'going', 'grow', 'up', 'be', 'someone', 'great', 'much', 'life', 'John', 'believe', 'even', 'life', 'keeps', 'handing', 'one', 'rotten', 'turn', 'going', 'be', 'someone', 'more', 'just', 'anonymous', 'face', 'crowd', 'big', 'break', 'really', 'just', 'corner', 'time', 'everything', 'will', 'start', 'go', 'swimmingly', 'close', 'analysis', 'not', 'really', 'particularly', 'likeable', 'ambitious', 'character', 'part', 'appeal', 'story', 'character', 'just', 'so', 'many', 'starting', 'out', 'believing', 'would', 'be', 'something', 'great', 'really', 'make', 'something', 'automatically', 'ladder', 'success', 'even', 'when', 'life', 'lemons', 'persisting', 'belief', 'not', 'going', 'be', 'forever', 'whole', 'life', 'could', ""n't"", 'really', 'be', 'wasted', 'nothing', 'more', 'squandered', 'missed', 'opportunities', 'done', 'well', 'school', 'job', 'as', 'good', 'company', 'wife', 'lightning-fast', 'seemingly', 'first', 'dating', 'experience', 'impulsive', 'marriage', 'proposal', 'based', 'subway', 'advertisement', 'house', 'sight', 'marital', 'problems', 'many', 'based', 'in-laws', 'disapproval', 'what', 'good', 'home', 'life', 'two', 'good', 'kids', 'big', 'chance', 'make', 'something', 'really', 'seem', 'be', 'only', 'matter', 'time', 'story', 'captivating', 'incredibly', 'real', 'life', 'becoming', 'even', 'more', 'so', 'further', 'depressing', 'story', 'many', 'times', 'real', 'life', 'depressing', 'real', 'happy', 'ending.This', 'film', 'was', 'made', 'when', 'silent', 'cinema', 'was', 'peak', 'evolution', 'comparison', 'films', 'even', 'five', 'years', 'earlier', 'story', 'would', 'never', 'have', 'worked', 'nearly', 'so', 'well', 'had', 'been', 'made', 'talking', 'picture', 'power', 'beauty', 'emotions', 'pull', 'nuances', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'lost', 'great', 'scenes', 'shots', 'illustrating', 'power', 'silence', 'tell', 'story', 'are', 'camera', 'panning', 'up', 'skyscraper', 'shot', 'desks', 'huge', 'office', 'John', 'scene', 'train', 'John', 'Mary', 'first', 'night', 'together', 'married', 'couple', 'fear', 'nervousness', 'how', ""'re"", 'going', 'have', 'sleep', 'same', 'bed', 'first', 'time', 'portrayed', 'incredibly', 'realistically', 'twelve', 'year', 'old', 'John', 'top', 'stairs', 'learning', 'father', 'died', 'haunting', 'final', 'shot', 'truly', 'one', 'most', 'memorable', 'endings', 'cinema', 'difficult', 'understand', 'why', 'one', 'greatest', 'silents', 'never', 'been', 'issued', 'DVD', 'numerous', 'lesser', 'silents', 'have', 'been', 'merited', 'worthy', 'DVD', 'treatment']",N/A
276153,A2YM9ILTAX0782,6301965744,"Birt Acres ""Cinemaniac""","[2, 2]","""The Crowd"" (1928) is a funny, sweet, sad film about individuality in a sea of humanity.  The film stars James Murray as a young man who travels to the big city of New York to make his fortune.  He's certain that with some persistence he'll make it to the top.  At first he mocks the teeming crowds of New York, seeing himself as towering above them in personal pride and determination.  But he gets married and the reality of poverty plagues him.  He fights with his wife and then promptly makes up, assuring her that one day his ""ship will come in.""  He wins $500 in an ad slogan contest and buys some toys for his children.  But tragedy awaits . . .The movie is touching in its portrayal of human nature.  While most silent films have wide-eyed actresses flailing their arms dramatically, ""The Crowd"" is quite subtle, much more like modern films.  The portrayal of husband and wife is also quite accurate, with good times and bad times intermixed.  And although we hope Murray will become successful, we also understand his despair.  The film does end ""happily,"" but it's not a simple or manufactured happy ending; indeed, it's the type of ""happy ending"" that any of us might experience today or tomorrow if we'd only realize it.",5,A Great Movie--Where's the Blu-ray or DVD?,1331337600,"03 10, 2012",2012,1232,"['Crowd', '1928', 'funny', 'sweet', 'sad', 'film', 'individuality', 'sea', 'humanity', 'film', 'James', 'Murray', 'young', 'man', 'who', 'big', 'city', 'New', 'York', 'make', 'fortune', 'certain', 'persistence', ""'ll"", 'make', 'top', 'first', 'teeming', 'crowds', 'New', 'York', 'seeing', 'towering', 'personal', 'pride', 'determination', 'married', 'reality', 'poverty', 'plagues', 'wife', 'then', 'promptly', 'up', 'assuring', 'one', 'day', 'ship', 'will', 'come', '500', 'ad', 'slogan', 'contest', 'toys', 'children', 'tragedy', 'awaits', '.The', 'movie', 'touching', 'portrayal', 'human', 'nature', 'most', 'silent', 'films', 'have', 'wide-eyed', 'actresses', 'flailing', 'arms', 'dramatically', 'Crowd', 'quite', 'subtle', 'much', 'more', 'modern', 'films', 'portrayal', 'husband', 'wife', 'also', 'quite', 'accurate', 'good', 'times', 'bad', 'times', 'intermixed', 'hope', 'Murray', 'will', 'become', 'successful', 'also', 'understand', 'despair', 'film', 'end', 'happily', 'not', 'simple', 'manufactured', 'happy', 'ending', 'indeed', 'type', 'happy', 'ending', 'might', 'experience', 'today', 'tomorrow', ""'d"", 'only', 'realize']",N/A

276155,A13E0ARAXI6KJW,6301965744,Ed Uyeshima,"[2, 2]","King Vidor was never the most subtle of filmmakers, but his heavily Baroque style served him well over a very long career with emotionally overwrought though supremely entertaining films like 1937'sStella Dallasand 1949'sThe Fountainhead. This seminal 1928 silent classic reflects Vidor's passion for melodrama but within a realistically bleak social commentary of America in the years leading toward the Great Depression. Written by Vidor and John V.A. Weaver, the story has an episodic structure that chronicles the life of an Everyman appropriately named John, born on the 4th of July in 1900, who believes his destiny is to become a big financial success. The movie follows his life as he works in New York as one of hundreds of accounting drones in an office building falls in love and marries a girl he meets through a co-worker (named Mary, of course), ekes out a meager existence as they raise two children and hits hard times after tragedy befalls them.That John and Mary's seemingly mundane lives can seem universally transcendent is a tribute to Vidor's filmmaking acumen. Thanks to Henry Sharp's remarkable camerawork, Vidor produces two of cinema's most impressive tracking shots - the first moving from street level up a skyscraper into a field of identical desks and zeroing in on John at #137, the second in a most expressionistic-looking maternity ward where John finds an exhausted Mary at the far end of the room and their baby is brought to them. Even though the angles and dimensions are exaggerated in these scenes, Vidor offsets this stylization with realistic scenes of the teeming anonymity of city life. The story of James Murray, an insecure extra Vidor picked out of obscurity to play John, lends a particular irony to the movie, as his tragic, alcohol-fueled life ended eight years later with a fall off a pier. It's a shame since he plays John with sincere gumption and wide-eyed enthusiasm. Vidor's wife, Eleanor Boardman, is affecting as the constantly put-upon Mary. Together they make a convincingly ordinary couple in this sharply rendered portrait of downward mobility and self-acceptance.",4,King Vidor's Bleak but Affecting Silent Classic About Desperate Lives in the Big City,1196640000,"12 3, 2007",2007,2125,"['King', 'Vidor', 'was', 'never', 'most', 'subtle', 'filmmakers', 'heavily', 'Baroque', 'style', 'served', 'well', 'very', 'long', 'career', 'emotionally', 'overwrought', 'supremely', 'entertaining', 'films', ""1937'sStella"", 'Dallasand', ""1949'sThe"", 'Fountainhead', 'seminal', '1928', 'silent', 'classic', 'Vidor', 'passion', 'melodrama', 'realistically', 'bleak', 'social', 'commentary', 'America', 'years', 'leading', 'Great', 'Depression', 'Written', 'Vidor', 'John', 'V.A', 'Weaver', 'story', 'episodic', 'structure', 'life', 'Everyman', 'appropriately', 'named', 'John', 'born', '4th', 'July', '1900', 'who', 'destiny', 'become', 'big', 'financial', 'success', 'movie', 'life', 'New', 'York', 'one', 'hundreds', 'accounting', 'drones', 'office', 'building', 'love', 'girl', 'co-worker', 'named', 'Mary', 'course', 'out', 'meager', 'existence', 'raise', 'two', 'children', 'hits', 'hard', 'times', 'tragedy', 'befalls', 'John', 'Mary', 'seemingly', 'mundane', 'lives', 'can', 'seem', 'universally', 'transcendent', 'tribute', 'Vidor', 'filmmaking', 'acumen', 'Thanks', 'Henry', 'Sharp', 'remarkable', 'camerawork', 'Vidor', 'two', 'cinema', 'most', 'impressive', 'tracking', 'shots', 'first', 'moving', 'street', 'level', 'skyscraper', 'field', 'identical', 'desks', 'zeroing', 'John', '137', 'second', 'most', 'expressionistic-looking', 'maternity', 'ward', 'where', 'John', 'exhausted', 'Mary', 'far', 'end', 'room', 'baby', 'brought', 'Even', 'angles', 'dimensions', 'are', 'exaggerated', 'scenes', 'Vidor', 'stylization', 'realistic', 'scenes', 'teeming', 'anonymity', 'city', 'life', 'story', 'James', 'Murray', 'insecure', 'extra', 'Vidor', 'picked', 'obscurity', 'play', 'John', 'particular', 'irony', 'movie', 'tragic', 'alcohol-fueled', 'life', 'ended', 'eight', 'years', 'later', 'fall', 'off', 'pier', 'shame', 'John', 'sincere', 'gumption', 'wide-eyed', 'enthusiasm', 'Vidor', 'wife', 'Eleanor', 'Boardman', 'affecting', 'constantly', 'put-upon', 'Mary', 'Together', 'make', 'convincingly', 'ordinary', 'couple', 'sharply', 'rendered', 'portrait', 'downward', 'mobility', 'self-acceptance']",N/A

276157,A33TED651NAXWU,6301965744,"Johnny Williams ""High School History Teacher""","[2, 2]","**Spoiler Alert****Spoiler Alert**There was a movie produced during the early part of the 20th century, that captured the unique perspective of that time period and of the people that lived during it, this movie was entitled ""The Crowd"". This movie portrayed fictional content, however in a historical perspective that illuminates the daily thoughts and mindsets of those individuals whom lived in that period of history. By watching this movie it allows historians to note and observe certain characteristics and nuances from the people that lived during that time, respectively from this film; the struggle of the early 20th century middle class, as well as class warfare and how they were perceived by the general population of the time.The movie ""The Crowd"" is about a young man from the middle class named Johnny who has the world set before him. He is ready to make and leave his mark on the world, and has been told that he would do so ever since he was a child. However once Johnny gets married his dreams become bogged down by daily routines, bills, and problems with his marriage, these things however does not deter his thoughts upon becoming a truly great man. Troubled by a myriad of problems ranging from a go nowhere non appreciated job, marriage and in law problems, and the death of one of his children, Johnny almost commits suicide but eventually comes to terms with his place in the world, that he isn't special at all...he is only part of ""The Crowd"".Analysis of this film and talking points to be made about it are conductive to understanding viewpoints of that period of history. The 20th century was just beginning and the middle class was just beginning to come into its own, a class that was desperately trying to reach forward to the upper class and become more than they were, be this by hard work and work ethic as shown by Johnny within the film, or by chance which was portrayed by Johnny by which he entered into various contest of writing slogans for consumer products and goods. Johnny had always been told by his father that he was going to grow up to be something special (which is really much like any child, again being part of ""The Crowd"" without actually knowing it) and Johnny carried this attitude into his adult life to make his mark upon the world. However when he marries this all changed, unfortunately his views does not. This reflects heavily upon the views of the population at the time, where most every person of society at the time strived to attain a better standing within society by moving up the virtual ladder of success and becoming more prominent in class, wealth, and personal standing in a station that was previously not accessible to them.Marriage comes with its own weight and responsibilities, and Johnny had this all throughout the film. Daily ruts, and the same old, same old, not moving anywhere attitude reflected the subconscious thoughts of Johnny, into physical actions toward his wife Mary. Thoughts and feeling during this time was that you should not get married until you can financially support it, that love doesn't feed the belly or clothe the back. However Johnny did just that because even if he did he had a plan, he was in love, and he was going to be great. The marital attitudes present during that time period to not getting married before you are financially stable can be seen in the film in the form of Mary's family, whom is seen to be thinking that their daughter deserved more than what she was being given, that Johnny was not ready for marriage, that he was stuck in a rut and a dead end job, and that their daughter had married a dud.This issue in itself could be said to have added to the point that Johnny did not quit his job earlier, because he did not want to face the mistake that he had made in societies eyes by becoming married before it was truly time to do so. Johnny would continue to stay at his job even after others that were less deserving was promoted over him by virtue of admitting his error to his family and society as a whole. To quit his job would also prove he was wrong all along. This would have likely continued, had not Johnny not suffered the loss of his daughter and quit his job due to a nervous breakdown.Other societal issues at large within the film are that of charity and how it was looked upon in that day and time. Just as when Mary's brothers (which were upper class) came to John and Mary about giving John a job, he refused because it was a charity Job. Even though it would have helped his family greatly, it was refused because it was a charity job. This instance in the film ties directly to two historical tenets of the time and that is that no one should accept ""Hand Out's"" and that you are supposed to be self reliant, self sufficient, and forge your own destiny to greatness, and the second of whereby the upper class is a struggle against the middle class, the haves and have not's dueling back and forth (metaphorically as Johnny and his in laws battle back and forth).Eventually Johnny comes to terms with his own self, in which the whole time of his life from early childhood, to older adult has proven to be not a failure, nor a successes, but that it is what it is, he like all the other middle class is only part of the crowd, forever part of a crowd that will not likely to raise above their station., and that people should accept this basic tenet of reality, for when they do (just like in Johnny's case) the world becomes a better place, and you become happier. The movie and society during that time period stresses complacency and acceptance of the position and place you have been dealt in life, and that all people have a function to serve no matter the class, but most fall within ""The Crowd"" of the middle class and that should not be something to be ashamed of.In conclusion the whole movie is pretty much a look at historical perspective in the form of a film that gives us insight to the many issues faces the people of that time period. It lets us perceive their thoughts, and how they used those thoughts whether for gain or ill, and lets us gain an insight toward class warfare, traditional values and mindset during that time

King Vidor's 1928 film tells the story of an average man, John Sims (James Murray), married to the average woman, Mary (Eleanor Boardman, who might be the most beautiful actress I have ever seen in a silent film), told in a naturalistic style (for the most part; there are some obvious exceptions such as the distorted sets and strange perspectives) that enhances its simple truths.  Murray had been an extra until Vidor made him a star, knowing that his story would never work with a leading man in the role of the American everyman.  John Sims is one of the faceless office workers (#137) in New York City, a dreamer who secretly writes advertising slogans hoping one will be his big break.  He finds Mary and proposes, honeymooning in Niagara Falls and then returning to live in a Manhattan flat overlooking the noisy el-train.  Years go by and John has made nothing of himself to improve the lot of his wife and two children.  The pivotal point in the film comes when the long dreamt for success finally arrives, only to be followed by a brutal tragedy.  Yet while the characters find themselves trapped in the depths of despair, the audience will certainly recognize the uplifting ending, especially since it is obviously a reflection of themselves.  Still, even with its final sense of hope, the film offers no solutions, an idea audiences would have been uncomfortable with if it had been made more explicit.  Vidor was nominated for an Oscar, the first year the awards were given, but lost out to Frank Borzage's &quot;Seventh Heaven,&quot; a more popular film that enjoys no where near the reputation of &quot;The Crowd&quot; today.

From the cover, I expected it to be another &quot;Metropolis.&quot;  I ended up enjoying it nonetheless for its realism.  The beginning of the film is actually quite comical once the leading character arrives in New York and meets his mate. It includes a fun look at the rides of Coney Island.  As the film goes on (and does it ever!  It is very long) one sees the leading character's perfect little world crumbling before him as he is buried in the drudgery, frustrations, disappointments, and tragedies of life in &quot;the crowd.&quot;  The acting is superb.  James Murray is perfect as the pitiful, yet well-meaning loser and Eleanor Boardman is excellent as his strong wife. I did not get the same uplifting feeling at the conclusion of the film as did some of the other reviewers.  The conclusion seemed a little weak after so long a movie.

I came away very moved by what I had seen.The greatness of ""The Crowd"" lies in the simplicity of its' focus.  It tells us a story about a child born to a man who predicts a great future for his infant.  We follow that young man, imbued by his father with a sense of destiny, as he seeks to discover his fotune and fame.  A strange thing happens along his path to glory; our hero becomes just like us. Yet, instead of becoming a commonplace standard Hollywood fare, ""The Crowd"" draws us in as we begin to see ourselves on the screen.  The brilliant depiction of day to day life brings to mind thoughts and actions we all experienced to a greater or lesser degree.  We grow more and more deeply involved with the Sims family with special focus on Mrs. Sims and the kids.  Indeed, it is the young son who turn everything around in three or four sentences that speak volumes and drive deep into our hearts.  The ending is suggestive but we know that what we suspect WILL happen.Early on in ""The Crowd"" our hero makes fun of all the ""little people"" who are all part of ""the crowd"".  He, remember, is destined for greater things.  In time we find ourselves drawn into that same crowd.

276162,A2EDZH51XHFA9B,6301965744,"Robert Beveridge ""xterminal""","[1, 1]","The Crowd (King Vidor, 1928)The inimitable King Vidor was, over the years, nominated for the Best Director Oscar five times, though he never won (and was passed over for some of the films that have come to solidify his reputation as one of the best directors in Hollywood history (Cynara, Our Daily Bread, and The Fountanihead being three notables). His first Best Director nomination came for 1928's The Crowd, which was also nominated for Best Picture (Unique and Artistic Creation), and permit me a quick digression to say hey, Academy? You need to bring that Oscar back. Vidor lost the Best Director Oscar to Frank Borzage; make of that what you will.The Crowd is the story of a family. As we open, John Sims (James Murray), whom we briefly see as a boy, has grown up to become a cog in the wheel in a big city, working in a high-rise and not standing out from the crowd at all. His friend Bert (Bert Roach) sets him up on a blind date to Coney Island, and that turns out to be Mary (Vidor's wife, Eleanor Boardman). After a whirlwind courtship that lasts exactly the amount of time they're at Coney Island, John and Mary decide to get hitched, and the rest of the film deals with the trials and tribulations of their marriage.There is no denying that The Crowd is exquisite work from a filmmaker on top of his game, though it could be successfully argued that, had Vidor made it just a year later, it would have been a better film. (The actors, most of whom were character and stock actors, have a tendency to that expressionist mugging so common in silent B-movies, and sound would probably have curtailed that in at least a few of them.) Still, if you look past the acting, it's pretty easy to see why this picture got a nomination for Unique and Artistic; Vidor's shot blocking is never less than perfect, and Henry Sharp's camerawork is exquisite. (Robert Osborne, commenting on the film on Turner Classic Movies, noted that many of the crowd shots were done surreptitiously, giving it a natural look rare even today.) The structure of the film (it seems odd to talk about a script in a silent movie), put together by Vidor and John Weaver, is dramatic without ever being overly so, though the silent-film mugging by the actors does tip it over into melodrama a few times. Still, this is a fine film, and well worth seeking out. *** ",4,"1928, the last great year of silent film...",1271289600,"04 15, 2010",2010,2342,"['Crowd', 'King', 'Vidor', '1928', 'inimitable', 'King', 'Vidor', 'was', 'years', 'nominated', 'Best', 'Director', 'Oscar', 'five', 'times', 'never', 'won', 'was', 'passed', 'films', 'have', 'come', 'solidify', 'reputation', 'one', 'best', 'directors', 'Hollywood', 'history', 'Cynara', 'Daily', 'Bread', 'Fountanihead', 'being', 'three', 'notables', 'first', 'Best', 'Director', 'nomination', 'came', '1928', 'Crowd', 'was', 'also', 'nominated', 'Best', 'Picture', 'Unique', 'Artistic', 'Creation', 'permit', 'quick', 'digression', 'say', 'hey', 'Academy', 'need', 'bring', 'Oscar', 'back', 'Vidor', 'lost', 'Best', 'Director', 'Oscar', 'Frank', 'Borzage', 'make', 'what', 'will.The', 'Crowd', 'story', 'family', 'open', 'John', 'Sims', 'James', 'Murray', 'whom', 'briefly', 'see', 'boy', 'grown', 'up', 'become', 'cog', 'wheel', 'big', 'city', 'working', 'high-rise', 'not', 'standing', 'out', 'crowd', 'friend', 'Bert', 'Bert', 'Roach', 'up', 'blind', 'date', 'Coney', 'Island', 'out', 'be', 'Mary', 'Vidor', 'wife', 'Eleanor', 'Boardman', 'whirlwind', 'courtship', 'exactly', 'amount', 'time', ""'re"", 'Coney', 'Island', 'John', 'Mary', 'decide', 'get', 'hitched', 'rest', 'film', 'deals', 'trials', 'tribulations', 'denying', 'Crowd', 'exquisite', 'work', 'filmmaker', 'top', 'game', 'could', 'be', 'successfully', 'argued', 'had', 'Vidor', 'made', 'just', 'year', 'later', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'better', 'film', 'actors', 'most', 'whom', 'were', 'character', 'stock', 'actors', 'have', 'tendency', 'expressionist', 'mugging', 'so', 'common', 'silent', 'B-movies', 'sound', 'would', 'probably', 'have', 'curtailed', 'least', 'few', 'Still', 'look', 'acting', 'pretty', 'easy', 'see', 'why', 'picture', 'got', 'nomination', 'Unique', 'Artistic', 'Vidor', 'shot', 'blocking', 'never', 'less', 'perfect', 'Henry', 'Sharp', 'camerawork', 'exquisite', 'Robert', 'Osborne', 'commenting', 'film', 'Turner', 'Classic', 'Movies', 'noted', 'many', 'crowd', 'shots', 'were', 'done', 'surreptitiously', 'giving', 'natural', 'look', 'rare', 'even', 'today', 'structure', 'film', 'odd', 'talk', 'script', 'silent', 'movie', 'put', 'together', 'Vidor', 'John', 'Weaver', 'dramatic', 'ever', 'being', 'overly', 'so', 'silent-film', 'mugging', 'actors', 'tip', 'over', 'melodrama', 'few', 'times', 'Still', 'fine', 'film', 'well', 'seeking', 'out', '***']",N/A

The pancake makeup, the googly eyes, the permanent waves, the heaving sighs--they never did anything for me.  But _The Crowd_, surprise, surprise, just so happens to be the best movie I've seen this summer.  The simple human tale of waves of dreams being dashed into spray on the cliffs of New York satisfies the viewer far more than the latest computer FX ever could.The film has its own remarkable special effects, achieved mostly through clever framing.  The scene with 12-year-old Johnny ascending the staircase is a masterpiece of the use of the lines of perspective.  The camera panning over to the adult John at his desk totting up columns of numbers, in a vast room with other men doing the same thing, is a great evocation of anonymity.The story itself is streets ahead of silent films from just ten years previous to it.  It has its share of pathos and melodrama-the plot twists at strict right angles--but a surprising element of ambivalence pervades the film, too.  The plucky young go-getter gets the girl with little effort--no Bluto to overcome.  But his hard work and winning personality don't win him the brass ring, either.
