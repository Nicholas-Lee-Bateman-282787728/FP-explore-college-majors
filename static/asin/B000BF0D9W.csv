Talk, talk, talk, in that phony movie-script kind of way where you can practically hear the keys of the screenwriter's typewriter clacking.  In the restaurant scene early in the movie, the ""waiters"" are typing food orders onto a computer screen that is totally black.  The computer isn't even turned on.  Production values are poor at best - poor sound, poor picture.  The acting is painful.  The film is boring.  But like I said, 20 minutes was all I could take.

941411,A1Y7C52533BA2H,B000BF0D9W,Blake Fraina,"[7, 9]","Never has an intelligent, thoughtful, warm and funny film been so badly served by its title. This is a wonderful, low-key character study/coming of age story/romantic comedy about Marcus, fresh from a recent and painful break-up, who gets work waiting tables at a NYC restaurant. The story follows Marcus and the small waitstaff over the course of one summer as they spend their time off looking for true love (or at the very least, great sex). The characters and dialogue in this one are the selling points. Every character was completely well defined - even where I expected to find a stereotype, I was always pleasantly surprised when he/she turned out to be a fully realized human being instead.And, after watching it, I finally figured out what it is that distinguishes that overused stereotype - ""the fag hag"" - from merely a woman with a gay male friend or friends. In virtually EVERY gay film I've ever seen, there is a woman (often overweight and usually loveless) who is entirely focused on advancing the love life of her gay friend and has, for all intents and purposes, utterly no life of her own. Marilyn, the token female in this film, might be a pretty pathetic alcoholic (and to the filmmaker's credit this condition is, ultimately, not played for laughs), but she is totally, selfishly, focused on her own quest for romance. No matter what anyone may say about this character - fag hag, she ain't. There is also Luke, the flamboyant and promiscuous bar-hopping friend - another clich&eacute;, perhaps, but so well-played by Jesse Archer, that you forgive the stereotype. And he too reveals a tender side in the end. Rounding out the quintet are Tyler, the hottie Welsh male model, and Peter, the chaste romantic holding out for the real thing.The dialogue is sensational - natural sounding and intelligent. The actors are attractive and deliver naturalistic, low-key performances that are very believable. There's no preaching. No good guys vs. bad guys. It's really just a slice of life. I cannot recommend this film highly enough. The only warning is that it offers little in the way of plot. It's mostly a character study, with a love story thrown in almost as an afterthought.This is a thoroughly winning film that deserves a wider audience...and a more fitting name.",5,"Very ""Reel"" to Life",1202774400,"02 12, 2008",2008,2288,"['Never', 'intelligent', 'thoughtful', 'warm', 'funny', 'film', 'been', 'so', 'badly', 'served', 'title', 'wonderful', 'low-key', 'character', 'study/coming', 'age', 'story/romantic', 'comedy', 'Marcus', 'fresh', 'recent', 'painful', 'break-up', 'who', 'work', 'waiting', 'tables', 'NYC', 'restaurant', 'story', 'Marcus', 'small', 'waitstaff', 'course', 'one', 'summer', 'spend', 'time', 'off', 'looking', 'true', 'love', 'very', 'least', 'great', 'sex', 'characters', 'dialogue', 'one', 'are', 'selling', 'points', 'character', 'was', 'completely', 'well', 'defined', 'even', 'where', 'expected', 'find', 'stereotype', 'was', 'always', 'pleasantly', 'surprised', 'when', 'he/she', 'turned', 'out', 'be', 'fully', 'realized', 'human', 'being', 'instead.And', 'watching', 'finally', 'figured', 'out', 'what', 'distinguishes', 'overused', 'stereotype', 'fag', 'hag', 'merely', 'woman', 'gay', 'male', 'friend', 'friends', 'virtually', 'EVERY', 'gay', 'film', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'seen', 'woman', 'often', 'overweight', 'usually', 'loveless', 'who', 'entirely', 'focused', 'advancing', 'love', 'life', 'gay', 'friend', 'intents', 'purposes', 'utterly', 'life', 'own', 'Marilyn', 'token', 'female', 'film', 'might', 'be', 'pretty', 'pathetic', 'alcoholic', 'filmmaker', 'credit', 'condition', 'ultimately', 'not', 'played', 'laughs', 'totally', 'selfishly', 'focused', 'own', 'quest', 'romance', 'matter', 'what', 'anyone', 'may', 'say', 'character', 'fag', 'hag', 'ai', ""n't"", 'also', 'Luke', 'flamboyant', 'promiscuous', 'bar-hopping', 'friend', 'clich', 'eacute', 'perhaps', 'so', 'well-played', 'Jesse', 'Archer', 'forgive', 'stereotype', 'too', 'tender', 'side', 'end', 'Rounding', 'out', 'quintet', 'are', 'Tyler', 'hottie', 'Welsh', 'male', 'model', 'Peter', 'chaste', 'romantic', 'holding', 'out', 'real', 'thing.The', 'dialogue', 'sensational', 'natural', 'sounding', 'intelligent', 'actors', 'are', 'attractive', 'deliver', 'naturalistic', 'low-key', 'performances', 'are', 'very', 'believable', 'preaching', 'good', 'guys', 'bad', 'guys', 'really', 'just', 'slice', 'life', 'can', 'not', 'recommend', 'film', 'highly', 'enough', 'only', 'warning', 'little', 'way', 'plot', 'mostly', 'character', 'study', 'love', 'story', 'thrown', 'almost', 'afterthought.This', 'thoroughly', 'winning', 'film', 'wider', 'audience', 'more', 'fitting', 'name']",Slutty Summer
941412,A3DVS9Y4Z1HIDJ,B000BF0D9W,"Bob Lind ""camelwest""","[6, 7]","In the 2004 indie ""Slutty Summer"", twenty-something novelist Marcus (Casper Andreas, who is also the film's writer - director -producer -editor) comes home to find his lover of four years cheating on him, and sends him packing.  To make ends meet, his friend Marilyn gets him a job as a waiter at the trendy Manhattan cafe, which has more than its share of gay waiters-wannabe-actors.  Marcus becomes friends with the campy, slutty Luke (a scene-stealing role played by newcomer Jesse Archer), the old-fashioned Peter, and gorgeous-but-shallow Tyler.  Marcus works on getting over his ex with a rebound-fling with Tyler, while Marilyn meets men through an internet ad, using a dating handbook as her bible on how to proceed.  Initially disillusioned by the apparent emphasis among single gay men to ""hook up"" rather than try to cultivate a relationship, Marcus becomes more independent and self-assured with what he wants out of life, as the co-workers are there for each other to celebrate each dating success and help comfort each other when things go badly.It's a simple story, told without any real surprises by a first-time screenwriter/director, by a group of actors with few credits, shot in 14 days on a tiny budget.  Within those parameters, it is actually quite an impressive work, though it provides no more than an entertaining distraction for an hour and a half, and some raised eyebrows from gay viewers who might see themselves or someone they know in the characters.  Production quality is far from perfect,  acting is occasionally wooden, and the stereotypical depictions of gay characters will bother some.  Played at gay film festivals and shown theatrically in a few cities as late as October of this year.DVD extras are plentiful, including deleted scenes, outtakes, audition tapes, director/actor interviews, and a rather amusing ""man on the (NYC) street"" session about sluts hosted by actor Jesse Archer (Conclusion:  It takes five to make an orgy.)",3,"Lightweight, semi-amusing gay romantic comedy",1133481600,"12 2, 2005",2005,1972,"['2004', 'indie', 'Slutty', 'Summer', 'twenty-something', 'novelist', 'Marcus', 'Casper', 'Andreas', 'who', 'also', 'film', 'writer', 'director', '-producer', '-editor', 'home', 'find', 'lover', 'four', 'years', 'cheating', 'packing', 'make', 'ends', 'meet', 'friend', 'Marilyn', 'job', 'waiter', 'trendy', 'Manhattan', 'cafe', 'more', 'share', 'gay', 'waiters-wannabe-actors', 'Marcus', 'friends', 'campy', 'slutty', 'Luke', 'scene-stealing', 'role', 'played', 'newcomer', 'Jesse', 'Archer', 'old-fashioned', 'Peter', 'gorgeous-but-shallow', 'Tyler', 'Marcus', 'getting', 'ex', 'rebound-fling', 'Tyler', 'Marilyn', 'meets', 'men', 'internet', 'ad', 'using', 'dating', 'handbook', 'bible', 'how', 'proceed', 'Initially', 'disillusioned', 'apparent', 'emphasis', 'single', 'gay', 'men', 'hook', 'up', 'rather', 'try', 'cultivate', 'relationship', 'Marcus', 'more', 'independent', 'self-assured', 'what', 'life', 'co-workers', 'are', 'there', 'other', 'celebrate', 'dating', 'success', 'help', 'comfort', 'other', 'when', 'things', 'go', 'badly.It', 'simple', 'story', 'told', 'real', 'surprises', 'first-time', 'screenwriter/director', 'group', 'actors', 'few', 'credits', 'shot', '14', 'days', 'tiny', 'budget', 'parameters', 'actually', 'quite', 'impressive', 'work', 'no', 'more', 'entertaining', 'distraction', 'hour', 'half', 'raised', 'eyebrows', 'gay', 'viewers', 'who', 'might', 'see', 'someone', 'know', 'characters', 'Production', 'quality', 'far', 'perfect', 'acting', 'occasionally', 'wooden', 'stereotypical', 'depictions', 'gay', 'characters', 'will', 'bother', 'Played', 'gay', 'film', 'festivals', 'shown', 'theatrically', 'few', 'cities', 'as', 'late', 'October', 'year.DVD', 'extras', 'are', 'plentiful', 'including', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'outtakes', 'audition', 'tapes', 'director/actor', 'interviews', 'rather', 'amusing', 'man', 'NYC', 'street', 'session', 'sluts', 'hosted', 'actor', 'Jesse', 'Archer', 'Conclusion', 'five', 'make', 'orgy']",Slutty Summer

You wanted a gay blockbuster? Well, watch ""Brokeback Mountain"" again. And again.One more warning - this is an indy gay comedy. Not gay porn. There is basically no nudity and sex is rather vaguely suggested than presented.

941416,A328S9RN3U5M68,B000BF0D9W,Grady Harp,"[9, 12]","Sometimes the title of a film has connotations that put people off, preventing them from viewing a film that has a lot of good points just because the title is tacky.  Such is the case for SLUTTY SUMMER.  This low budget first film by writer/producer/director/actor Casper Andreas may not have the substance or finesse that other independent films have, but taken as a whole it is an entertaining outing that deserves more credit than it has received. One wonders if a different title and cover image would have resulted in a larger more attentive audience.Summer in Manhattan and new writer Marcus (Andreas) has just terminated a relationship with unfaithful Julian (Christos Klapsis) and finds solace in his man-hungry but gay-friendly friend Marilyn (Virginia Bryan) who lands him a waiter position in a small restaurant where all waiters are various stereotypes of gay men: ex-model sleeparound Tyler (Jamie Hatchett), hopeless romantic wannabe actor Peter (Jeffrey Christopher Todd), nellie flamboyant one night stander Luke (Jesse Archer) and the obnoxious manager Kevin (Lance Werth).  Through a lot of visits to bars and hangouts the crew try to soften Markus' hurt and in doing so open Markus' eyes  (indeed, everyone's eyes) to the significance of relationships in the flippant world of gay  Manhattan.Yes, the story has been done before but life keeps repeating the same stories, too, and it is fine to have a different take on same sex ways of life and philosophy in the big city.  For a film shot in 14 days there is a fine amount of attention paid to small details of conversations. Markus proves an economical director. The cast of mostly inexperienced actors does well, and even if they do seem to be parodies of stereotypes, they do establish understandable characters.  For a first film this is a pretty successful outing. With different packaging perhaps it could have had a better chance in the theaters.

No new ground broken here, the stories are similar to many you've seen before, but the acting is natural and smooth, the writing and directing solid and the editing is great.  The guys are all VERY sexy and show off their hot pecs and abs often.  I'm partial to the writer/director Casper Andreas.  He's level headed, intelligent and dreamy at the same time.  A perfect combination.  There are a slew of bad gay films out on the market.  This one is so much fun and I really look forward to the writer/director's next project!",4,So much fun and sexy as hell,1133308800,"11 30, 2005",2005,629,"['Watched', 'Slutty', 'Summer', 'first', 'time', 'week', 'DVD', 'indy', 'very', 'low-budget', 'wonderful', 'new', 'ground', 'broken', 'here', 'stories', 'are', 'similar', 'many', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'acting', 'natural', 'smooth', 'writing', 'directing', 'solid', 'editing', 'great', 'guys', 'are', 'VERY', 'sexy', 'show', 'off', 'hot', 'pecs', 'abs', 'often', ""'m"", 'partial', 'writer/director', 'Casper', 'Andreas', 'level', 'headed', 'intelligent', 'dreamy', 'same', 'time', 'perfect', 'combination', 'are', 'slew', 'bad', 'gay', 'films', 'out', 'market', 'one', 'so', 'much', 'fun', 'really', 'look', 'forward', 'writer/director', 'next', 'project']",Slutty Summer

The production values and writing are extremely weak, though in some cases, this gives the film a more realistic feel.  The biggest problem is the acting and casting.  I realize it's a movie, but is everyone in New York this perfect looking??  It's like they cast a bunch of models and that in itself is part of the problem. The acting is extremely uneven.  Jamie Hatchett as Tyler and Jesse Archer as Luke both have tons of charm  and presence that draw you to their characters. They seem very natural on screen, particularly Hatchett. But Casper Andreas is one of the worst actors I've ever seen and since he's the main character, Markus, that's a problem.  He has a very strange way of talking and almost seems to have an accent of some sort.  He seems to equate saying something in a strange and loud way with emoting. There's a scene where Markus and Tyler are talking after going on a date that is one of the worst I've seen, the acting is literally painful.  Also doing a poor job is Virginia Bryan as the requisite fag hag.  Her performance is so over the top crazy at all times I found myself groaning whenever she appeared on the screen.  That said, if you just want to look at some pretty guys and be mildly amused, you could do worse.",3,Mildly Entertaining,1158883200,"09 22, 2006",2006,1370,"['just', 'want', 'light', 'summer', 'entertainment', 'movie', 'fine', 'predictable', 'sweet', 'ultimately', 'romantic', 'production', 'values', 'writing', 'are', 'extremely', 'weak', 'cases', 'film', 'more', 'realistic', 'feel', 'biggest', 'problem', 'acting', 'casting', 'realize', 'movie', 'everyone', 'New', 'York', 'perfect', 'looking', 'cast', 'bunch', 'models', 'part', 'problem', 'acting', 'extremely', 'uneven', 'Jamie', 'Hatchett', 'Tyler', 'Jesse', 'Archer', 'Luke', 'have', 'tons', 'charm', 'presence', 'characters', 'seem', 'very', 'natural', 'screen', 'particularly', 'Hatchett', 'Casper', 'Andreas', 'one', 'worst', 'actors', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'seen', 'main', 'character', 'Markus', 'problem', 'very', 'strange', 'way', 'talking', 'almost', 'have', 'accent', 'sort', 'equate', 'saying', 'something', 'strange', 'loud', 'way', 'emoting', 'scene', 'where', 'Markus', 'Tyler', 'are', 'talking', 'going', 'date', 'one', 'worst', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'acting', 'literally', 'painful', 'Also', 'doing', 'poor', 'job', 'Virginia', 'Bryan', 'requisite', 'fag', 'hag', 'performance', 'so', 'top', 'crazy', 'times', 'found', 'groaning', 'whenever', 'appeared', 'screen', 'said', 'just', 'want', 'look', 'pretty', 'guys', 'be', 'mildly', 'amused', 'could', 'do', 'worse']",Slutty Summer
