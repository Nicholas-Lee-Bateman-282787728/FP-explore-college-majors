1442174,A3R7PQAHD3NZM0,B00553K9XK,Autumn Blues Reviews,"[0, 0]","I was anxiously awaiting to review this DVD since I am a Keanu Reeves and James Caan fan. It had certainly been awhile since I had watched a film with either of these actors in it. Henry's Crime keeps pretty much the same pace throughout the movie, so don't expect any special effects or crazy action. It is a laid back film that kept my interest and had me laughing throughout the entire movie. You can't help but love the character played by Keanu Reeves, as Henry seems to be the type of man who like a magnet, seems to attract the wrong kind of people and naively gets himself into bad situations. Bad things just happen to Henry! While in jail for a crime he didn't commit, Henry's lightbulb goes on after speaking with Max (James Caan), another prisoner he befriends. This is when Henry then decides that if he did the time, he might as well do the crime. Why not just do what he was accused of? I love the character played by Julie (Vera Farmiga), she is smart, beautiful, sassy and she doesn't seem to have a care in the world. That was, of course, until Henry came along. The cast of characters were a treat, including James Caan who was just as good as ever, and certainly has not lost his touch. Twists of irony appear throughout the movie. People involved in the first heist are re-introduced later into Henry's caper with events that will have you chuckling and smiling. Although the ending left me hanging, I was pleased overall with the movie and would certainly watch it again.",4,A witty and delightful plot with a quirky cast of characters!,1315526400,"09 9, 2011",2011,1493,"['was', 'anxiously', 'awaiting', 'review', 'DVD', 'am', 'Keanu', 'Reeves', 'James', 'Caan', 'fan', 'had', 'certainly', 'been', 'awhile', 'had', 'watched', 'film', 'actors', 'Henry', 'Crime', 'pretty', 'much', 'same', 'pace', 'movie', 'so', 'do', ""n't"", 'expect', 'special', 'effects', 'crazy', 'action', 'laid', 'back', 'film', 'kept', 'interest', 'had', 'laughing', 'entire', 'movie', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'love', 'character', 'played', 'Keanu', 'Reeves', 'Henry', 'be', 'type', 'man', 'who', 'magnet', 'attract', 'wrong', 'kind', 'people', 'naively', 'bad', 'situations', 'Bad', 'things', 'just', 'happen', 'Henry', 'jail', 'crime', 'did', ""n't"", 'commit', 'Henry', 'lightbulb', 'speaking', 'Max', 'James', 'Caan', 'prisoner', 'when', 'Henry', 'then', 'did', 'time', 'might', 'as', 'well', 'do', 'crime', 'Why', 'not', 'just', 'do', 'what', 'was', 'accused', 'love', 'character', 'played', 'Julie', 'Vera', 'Farmiga', 'smart', 'beautiful', 'sassy', ""n't"", 'seem', 'have', 'care', 'world', 'was', 'course', 'Henry', 'came', 'along', 'cast', 'characters', 'were', 'treat', 'including', 'James', 'Caan', 'who', 'was', 'just', 'as', 'good', 'ever', 'certainly', 'not', 'lost', 'touch', 'Twists', 'irony', 'appear', 'movie', 'People', 'involved', 'first', 'heist', 'are', 're-introduced', 'later', 'Henry', 'caper', 'events', 'will', 'have', 'chuckling', 'smiling', 'ending', 'left', 'hanging', 'was', 'pleased', 'overall', 'movie', 'would', 'certainly', 'watch', 'again']",N/A

1442180,A2FEJIORC1MBG3,B00553K9XK,D. Hartley,"[22, 25]","One assumes that Henry (Keanu Reeves) has some kind of inner life. He seems to be a likable, easy-going fellow; it's just that he's a bit...inscrutable. Maybe it's his job. Working the graveyard shift night after night at a N.Y. Thruway tollbooth would put anybody in semi-comatose state. Nothing fazes the agreeable yet impassive Henry, one way or the other-although he does display a slight twitch when, one morning at breakfast, his wife (Judy Greer) broaches the subject of the couple having a child. Suddenly, we get the impression that Henry would prefer to be anywhere else but there, at that moment, having that particular conversation. What's going on? Is this a troubled marriage? Does he love his wife? Is this cipher of a man internally harboring primal doubts about life itself? Or...is he suffering in silence from a sudden attack of gas? There's really no way of discerning.We never get a chance to find out exactly what Henry is contemplating, because that is precisely the moment that Fate intervenes. An old high school chum named Eddie Vibes (Fisher Stevens) unexpectedly shows up on his doorstep, with a drunken cohort in tow. Both men are dubiously outfitted for a game of baseball. Eddie wants to know if Henry can give them a ride to their ""game"". Nothing about this questionable early-morning scenario seems to raise any red flags for the ever-malleable Henry. Even Eddie's request to stop at the bank ""on the way""-and to park the car out front and wait while his passengers go inside-fails to elicit the tiniest raised eyebrow from Henry. Needless to say, the heist goes awry, Henry's car stalls, his ""friends"" flee...and guess who ends up in stir?Although he owes them squat, Henry doesn't rat out the real culprits and takes the fall, while his demeanor remains unchanged. At this point, one might surmise that Henry is either some kind of transcendent Zen master...or a clueless moron (not unlike the protagonist of ""Forrest Gump"" or Chance the gardener in ""Being There""). Ah, but our little wooden boy is about to meet his Geppetto. Max (James Caan) is a veteran con man. He's one of those oddball convicts who actually ""likes"" prison-which is why he has been sabotaging his own parole hearings and enabling himself to continue living on the state's dime. He becomes a mentor/father figure to Henry, who takes it to heart when Max advises him that he needs to find a Dream, and then pursue it. So what is Henry's resultant epiphany? Since he's already done the time, he might as well now do the crime. Classic heist caper tropes ensue, with a love interest tossed in for good measure(Vera Farmiga).There's a little d&eacute;j&agrave; vu running through this film (the second effort from ""44 Inch Chest"" director Malcolm Venville). Sacha Gervasi and David White's script may have been ""inspired"" by some vintage heist flicks; specifically, Alexander Mackendrick's 1955 comedy ""The Ladykillers"", and Lloyd Bacon's ""Larceny, Inc."" from 1942 (essentially remade by Woody Allen as ""Small Time Crooks""). I thought that James Caan was recycling his ""Mr. Henry"" persona from Wes Anderson's ""Bottle Rocket"" a wee bit. While the film has classic screwball tropes, it lacks the kinetic pace of Lubitsch or Sturges. That being said, I still found Venville's film to be quite engaging and entertaining-within its own unique universe (yes, even the somnambulant-as-usual Keanu). I was reminded of Vincent Gallo's criminally underappreciated ""Buffalo '66""; in addition the fact that it also was filmed in and around the Buffalo area, it's another one of those low-key comedies with oddly endearing characters that ""sneaks up"" on you, especially once you realize how genuinely touching and sweet it really is at its core.

1442181,A328S9RN3U5M68,B00553K9XK,Grady Harp,"[11, 12]","HENRY'S CRIME is a dark comedy that actually carries a fairly good afterburn.  The story is solid, the characters are unusual, and the setting in Buffalo, NY is appropriately dark and dank.  This is a tale of how people react to their own personalities, moving through the world seemingly oblivious to those around them, afraid to create dreams much less go after them.Flatline Henry Torne (Keanu Reeves) works the night shift in a freeway tollbooth, quite alone, and seemingly undisturbed by his isolation. At dawn he goes home to his tiny house where he greets his wife, nurse Debbie (Judy Geer) who wants to talk about beginning a family but as usual things distract the couple's ability to have a conversation.  Friends pick up Henry to have him replace a member of the neighborhood baseball team and Henry goes along (as he does with everything that comes his way) only to wind up as the driver of a getaway car for his 'teammates' as they pause to rob a bank.  Henry is so loopy that he is not sure what happened and is arrested by the bank cop Frank (Bill Duke) and without much effort in protecting his innocence, Henry is convicted and imprisoned.  There he meets Max Saltzman (James Caan) who loves being in the protection of prison (low goals in life). When Henry comes up for parole, Max wishes him luck in finding a dream (or waking up to life) and Henry wanders back to his home: Debbie has married worthless Joe (Danny Hoch) and is pregnant - and none of this seems to bother Henry either.  Henry decides to return to the bank he was convicted of 'robbing' and is struck by a cellphone carrying driving actress Julie (Vera Farmiga).  Henry has feelings (surprise!) for Julie, follows her into the theater next to the bank where Julie is rehearsing Chekhov's 'The Cherry Orchard'.  Things finally begin to move: the theater is connected to the bank by a tunnel, Henry visits Max and convinces him to get out on parole, and the two men plan to actually rob the bank Henry was sent to prison for not robbing!  From here the puzzle takes twists and turns but the result is Henry's finally waking up to his emotions (with Julie), with a 'dream' of robbing the bank to repay the fact that he was unjustly incarcerated, and nothing  - and everything - goes as planned with big surprises in the end.Malcolm Venville directs this plodding venture written by Sacha Gervasi, David  White, and Stephen Hamel. Much of the plot is rather silly but that seems somehow proper for a character as bland as Henry (played with appropriate flatness by Reeves). Farmiga and Caan add the sparkle that keeps the boat afloat. Just when viewers are about to groan over this story, it reminds everyone of some of the people who are sleepwalking through life, whether blandly or anxiously, and by film's end the importance of dreams and an appreciation of the events that make our lives interesting and quirky provides some valuable food for thought.

1442188,A1IWWRZJOXOSYP,B00553K9XK,Lee Armstrong,"[0, 0]","I enjoyed ""Henry's Crime"" immensely.  Malcolm Venville's second feature has kind of a clunky pacing, but it suits this offbeat world.  Keeanu Reeves gives a tremendously understated performance as Henry Torne, a man without dreams, yet somehow vaguely dissatisfied with the routine of life.  When his wife Debbie played by Judy Greer tells him that she's fallen in love with another guy, he seems genuinely happy for her; ""I want you to be happy.""  Reeves gives ""laid back"" a new low water mark with his almost complete absence of anxiety.  This is the quality that makes the film almost surreal and which makes it work.  Fisher Stevens who I loved to hate in his appearance on the TV show ""Medium"" does a good job as the false friend Eddie Vibes who sets Henry up for a crime.  Danny Hoch who I saw in ""We Own the Night"" does a great job as the dimwitted Joe who marries Henry's wife.  James Caan plays the charming Max Saltzman, a confidence man, who can smooth talk himself into or out of most situations.  I also enjoyed Currie Graham's Simon who was very creepy recently on an episode of TV's ""Grimm.""  Currie plays the stage manager who flits about unobtrusively trying to get the actors in their places.  Most notable in the cast is Vera Farmiga as Julie Ivanova.  She was nominated for a supporting actress Oscar for ""Up in the Air"" with George Clooney.  She does a good job of playing the hard-edged actress whose dreams are just a bit bigger than her accomplishments.  Framing the film are the rehearsals and performances of Chekov's classic play ""The Cherry Orchard.""  Its theme of dreams lost is the perfect companion piece for ""Henry's Crime.""  Ultimately, ""Henry's Crime"" is an offbeat romance.  Everything else serves that story.  So at the very last frame when the screen goes black apparently leaving so many loose ends; the point is that none of them matter.  What matters is finding another heart, who when all else seems to go wrong or not fit, is the one on whom you can rely.  So for a guy who hasHarold and Maudeas one of my classic films, ""Henry's Crime"" is utterly wonderful and weird.

1442191,A2DAHERP7HYJGO,B00553K9XK,Mark Turner,"[0, 0]","Keanu Reeves is an actor that people either seem to love or hate. Those that love him think of him as Neo in THE MATRIX films. Those that hate him think he's little more than bumbler Ted from the BILL AND TED movies. The fact is he's both and so much more. He's an actor who has good and bad moments like everyone else in the world. And in HENRY'S CRIME he displays what would appear on the surface to be a wooden character but who is actually a man who never quite came alive.Henry Torne is in a rut. He works as a toll booth collector and goes through his day to day existence with no life to his life. When his wife (Judy Greer) talks about having children he doesn't even get excited about that. But his life changes.Asked by a friend to drive them to participate in a baseball game, Henry unwittingly finds himself the driver of a getaway car for a bank robbery. Left behind, he's arrested and sentenced to prison, never giving up the names of those who were with him.Henry's cell mate is a long time prisoner named Max Saltzman (James Caan). A confidence man who's been in prison for years, Max is content with the system, it works for him. He talks to Henry about finding your goal in life, living up to your potential, and then trying to make it happen. For him, that's prison.During a discussion between prisoners Henry finds his mission in life. He's in prison for a crime he didn't commit. That being the case he twists things backwards. He's done the time, now he needs to do the crime.After his release Henry stands outside of the bank he was arrested in front of. Stepping into the street he's hit by a car driven by Julie Ivanova (Vera Farmiga). Julie makes sure he's okay, takes him to a small coffee shop across the street and leaves him to get to work. It's in the bathroom Henry finds his mission when he sees an old front page of the local newspaper from decades ago describing a tunnel between the bank and the theater across the street.Visiting the theater, Henry finds Julie involved in the play THE ORCHARD TREE being performed there. They talk and he looks around the building, realizing that perhaps the tunnel still exists. Visiting Max in prison, he asks for his help which means Max getting out. Max follows through, looks over the job and things move forward.Various other criminals get involved in the whole story and Henry begins dating Julie. For once he seems to have something in his life that makes him want to move forward, to wake up in the morning. But once the crime is finished, he leaves Julie behind and moves on. Is it the crime that is the focus of Henry's life now? Or is it Julie?Reeves performance is one that is unusual at best. Henry is a stoic individual who rarely if ever displays emotion. It is only on stage while performing with Julie that he shows anything at all. But that's the character Reeves is playing here. A man dead to the world who had no clue how to let lose, how to expose himself to anyone. And when he does, he does so on his terms, displaying nothing on his face but plenty in his actions and words.The entire cast does an excellent job as well, supporting Reeves character while establishing their own at the same time. Particularly interesting was watching Caan as Max and thinking back to his 1981 film THIEF where he plays a bank robbing thief as well. It might make an interesting double feature at home one night.The nice thing about this film is that it has a feel good sense about it without getting mushy. You want Henry to find life, you want him to find something, anything, that will wake him up and make him get out into the world. And by the end of the film you realize that perhaps he just might make it after all.",3,"SMALL FILM, BIG HEART",1332201600,"03 20, 2012",2012,3701,"['Keanu', 'Reeves', 'actor', 'people', 'either', 'seem', 'love', 'hate', 'love', 'think', 'Neo', 'THE', 'MATRIX', 'films', 'hate', 'think', 'little', 'more', 'bumbler', 'Ted', 'BILL', 'AND', 'TED', 'movies', 'fact', 'so', 'much', 'more', 'actor', 'who', 'good', 'bad', 'moments', 'everyone', 'else', 'world', 'HENRY', 'CRIME', 'what', 'would', 'appear', 'surface', 'be', 'wooden', 'character', 'who', 'actually', 'man', 'who', 'never', 'quite', 'came', 'alive.Henry', 'Torne', 'rut', 'toll', 'collector', 'day', 'day', 'existence', 'life', 'life', 'When', 'wife', 'Judy', 'Greer', 'talks', 'having', 'children', ""n't"", 'even', 'get', 'excited', 'life', 'changes.Asked', 'friend', 'drive', 'participate', 'baseball', 'game', 'Henry', 'unwittingly', 'driver', 'getaway', 'car', 'bank', 'robbery', 'Left', 'behind', 'arrested', 'sentenced', 'prison', 'never', 'giving', 'up', 'names', 'who', 'were', 'him.Henry', 'cell', 'mate', 'long', 'time', 'prisoner', 'named', 'Max', 'Saltzman', 'James', 'Caan', 'confidence', 'man', 'who', 'been', 'prison', 'years', 'Max', 'content', 'system', 'Henry', 'finding', 'goal', 'life', 'living', 'up', 'potential', 'then', 'trying', 'make', 'happen', 'prison.During', 'discussion', 'prisoners', 'Henry', 'mission', 'life', 'prison', 'crime', 'did', ""n't"", 'commit', 'being', 'case', 'things', 'backwards', 'done', 'time', 'now', 'do', 'crime.After', 'release', 'Henry', 'bank', 'was', 'arrested', 'front', 'Stepping', 'street', 'hit', 'car', 'driven', 'Julie', 'Ivanova', 'Vera', 'Farmiga', 'Julie', 'sure', 'okay', 'small', 'coffee', 'shop', 'street', 'get', 'work', 'bathroom', 'Henry', 'mission', 'when', 'old', 'front', 'page', 'local', 'newspaper', 'decades', 'describing', 'tunnel', 'bank', 'theater', 'street.Visiting', 'theater', 'Henry', 'Julie', 'involved', 'play', 'THE', 'ORCHARD', 'TREE', 'being', 'performed', 'there', 'talk', 'building', 'realizing', 'perhaps', 'tunnel', 'still', 'Visiting', 'Max', 'prison', 'help', 'Max', 'getting', 'out', 'Max', 'through', 'job', 'things', 'move', 'forward.Various', 'other', 'criminals', 'get', 'involved', 'whole', 'story', 'Henry', 'dating', 'Julie', 'once', 'have', 'something', 'life', 'want', 'move', 'forward', 'wake', 'up', 'morning', 'once', 'crime', 'finished', 'Julie', 'behind', 'moves', 'crime', 'focus', 'Henry', 'life', 'now', 'Julie', 'Reeves', 'performance', 'one', 'unusual', 'best', 'Henry', 'stoic', 'individual', 'who', 'rarely', 'ever', 'emotion', 'only', 'stage', 'performing', 'Julie', 'anything', 'character', 'Reeves', 'playing', 'here', 'man', 'dead', 'world', 'who', 'had', 'clue', 'how', 'let', 'lose', 'how', 'expose', 'anyone', 'when', 'so', 'terms', 'displaying', 'nothing', 'face', 'plenty', 'actions', 'words.The', 'entire', 'cast', 'excellent', 'job', 'as', 'well', 'supporting', 'Reeves', 'character', 'establishing', 'own', 'same', 'time', 'Particularly', 'interesting', 'was', 'watching', 'Caan', 'Max', 'thinking', 'back', '1981', 'film', 'THIEF', 'where', 'bank', 'robbing', 'thief', 'as', 'well', 'might', 'make', 'interesting', 'double', 'feature', 'home', 'one', 'night.The', 'nice', 'thing', 'film', 'feel', 'good', 'sense', 'getting', 'mushy', 'want', 'Henry', 'find', 'life', 'want', 'find', 'something', 'anything', 'will', 'wake', 'up', 'make', 'get', 'out', 'world', 'end', 'film', 'realize', 'perhaps', 'just', 'might', 'make']",N/A

1442194,A1AWJUDQU6JXGU,B00553K9XK,Music maven,"[1, 2]","Henry's Crime has a good idea for a movie, but that idea is handled in a lazy, ham-fisted way, more like a treatment than a fully developed script. The actors do the best they can, and in the case of James Caan and Vera Farmiga, that's quite a lot, but the writing and direction work against them at every turn. Where the plot developments don't feel random, they feel mechanical rather than organic. Opportunities for really interesting plot developments---like having Henry's wife take up with one of the gang that robbed the bank initially and left him to take the rap---are left on the vine to rot, while other elements that are completely unnecessary---the bank guard becoming part of the heist---are pursued and then dropped.  None of this is helped by having Keanu Reeves in the lead role. I like him in action movies or films where his expressive limitations are an asset, like The Day the Earth Stood Still, but here, where he's required to actually act, his shortcomings are painfully obvious. Most telling is the scene in which he's trying out for the role in the Cherry Orchard. He's supposed to start by being unable to act and then under the director's guidance make a dramatic shift to real acting that wins everyone over. There is supposed to be a day-and-night change here, but in Reeve's case, he goes from completely inert to barely perceptible expression. Every scene he's in grinds to a halt almost immediately.

Julie (Vera Farmiga), the woman who clocked Henry with her car is an actress, performing in ""The Cherry Orchard"" a play like the movie is both a comedy and tragedy. The metaphors pile up. His job as a toll booth operator symbolizes someone who goes nowhere while watching everyone go somewhere.

After a trip to a baseball game ends badly, Henry (Reeves) winds up in jail for a bank robbery he didn't commit. While waiting to get out his wife falls in love with another man. Upon release he comes up with an idea, to rob the bank. This movie was much much better then I was expecting it to be. The big problem is the casting. Not so much the choices, but whoever thought it was a good idea to pair up Keaneu Reeves and James Caan overlooked one big thing. Reeves can't act. Other than that, the idea is a very neat one and the writing is very good. Caan does a great job in trying to carry the movie in the scenes he is in (most with Reeves) and is both funny and serious at the same time. Overall, I really did like this movie and the idea of it. The bad acting is not enough to prevent you from watching it, and I recommend you do.

1442206,ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T,B00553K9XK,Tsuyoshi,"[0, 0]","Keanu Reeves is Henry, a Buffalo tollbooth collector who is caught and sentenced for the crime he didn't commit. After spending a year in prison, Henry decides to change his life ... by stealing money from the bank he didn't rob. Henry manages to enlist the help of an inmate Max (James Caan), but the off-beat story takes a romantic turn when Henry meets and falls in love with a stage actress Julie (Vera Farmiga), who happens to be rehearsing for the Chekhov play in the theater next to the bank.Written by Sacha Gervasi and David White, the story has potential but never fulfills it. Henry's transformation from nave to daring doesn't convince. Neither do some of his motives, including his reluctance to tell the truths when he got arrested for the crime he didn't commit. Caan's character Max is more interesting and believable. Not just a comic relief, he adds much-needed warmth and humor to the film. Wait till his characters shows up.Some may argue that ""Henry's Crime"" is not really a heist film. In fact its story has too many plot holes to be called one (didn't anyone notice the big sound they were making?) The romance between Julie and Henry fares slightly better with always reliable Vera Farmiga though the film is definitely not her best. Supporting players include Bill Duke, Judy Greer, Danny Hoch, Fisher Stevens and Peter Stormare.""Henry's Crime"" is a pretty enjoyable off-beat heist comedy romance, maybe a bit too off-beat for me to enjoy.",3,Off-Beat Heist Romantic Comedy ...
