Trust me im being nice!This movie is kind of a restart that more closely imitates the book (according to the Japanese makers of this film) but it is a pretty good add on to the first flick! I was expecting a realy cheesy movie with horrible motion artifacts and boring gaps of wasted time and OK CG effects that make the hole thing barely tolerable. I was soooooo wrong!There CG work is detailed and well thought out and the special effects are fantastic. The story is big in scope and rather scary when the bugs' plan is finaly revealed. The threat of the bugs has been stepped up bigtime.As an ameture computer animator I can spend alot of time critisizing a lot of little things the Japanese animators did wrong or mostly wrong but im not going to do that. However I will say 3 things that are common problems I see in this movie and in 2D anime. 1. There was 1 to many ""glory"" shots! Some of the ladies got these slow sexy shots that started at their feet all the way up to their faces. All this while being naked. Males are obviously the target audience here. 2. There were a couple of non-action situations that could've gone better. The Japanese typicaly have some guy (or gal) who is the hardass in custody, soon to be released, or emotionally distant from everyone else who later comes to save the day. Sound familiar anime lovers? 3. Although this film did a much better job of it, most of the characters were very similar in appearance. The women in particular.All that said the movie is kick ass with awesome surround sound, crisp HD picture, and some stunning brutal visuals! Im very happy this movie is in my collection.

1548556,A33Y35HJGDHZ2H,B0088X7YMS,B. Wright,"[1, 1]","While I generally liked this film, the story needed a lot more work.  As a pilot for a TV series, this story would have been fine. More than fine, actually. For a full length feature film, it needed a whole lot more work.StoryI did like that we got to see Ibanez, Rico and Carl again. And, these characters are really the linchpins holding this whole movie together. The problem with the story is that just when new trooper characters are introduced, they are then almost immediately killed off. So, you try to invest time in these new characters only to see them killed by bugs quickly. Yes, this did happen in the first Starship Troopers, but not within 5-10 minutes after meeting the character.The story starts out that basically Ibanez loses her ship, the John A. Warden, to Carl who takes it over on a 'classified' mission. Of course, knowing Carl and his predilection for brain bugs, you can guess where he takes the ship. So, after an assault mission against a small asteroid populated by the familiar infantry bugs, we meet a troop of soldiers who manage to survive that assault, along with their leader 'hero' who's being detained on some trumped up charges.  So, the John A. Warden goes missing and all heck breaks loose.  Suffice it to say that they end up on a chase after the Warden, meet up with it, deal with Carl (in a freaked out state) and then attempt to take control of the Warden.  Unfortunately, they do all the wrong things and the brain bug retakes control over the ship who ultimately crashes it on Earth.After Rico, in his space station that almost gets rammed by the Warden on the way to Earth, decides to gear up and head down to the ship, the space station heats up some nukes 'just in case'.  So, everything goes from bad to worse and more troopers die and the nukes are blown out of the sky.  Rico ends up playing space cowboy and saves the day and Ibanez and Carl.  Of course, the rest of the troopers were expendable.This is a fairly typical shallow cartoon storyline and would have worked great to introduce characters for a series.  As a standalone production, it's rings very hollow and feels under produced.Sex ScenesWhile there were some sex scenes in the original Paul Verhoeven film, it wasn't nearly as gratuitous as it is in this film.  Frankly, it wasn't really necessary to see CGI characters doing that. In a film, it can work. With CGI, it's just really doesn't work.  At least, not unless the characters are a lot more photo realistic.  So, frankly, those scenes could have been left out.GraphicsThe Trooper armor suits are extremely well done.  The metal looks like metal and the suits look very real, when they are geared up. However, the faces, hands and bodies of the CG characters feel like cartoons, flat, dull and unreal.  The mouth movements might as well just be open/close.  There's no real emotion in the lips. So, while you have the feeling of solid metal suits and weapons in space, the skin and bodies look and move in unreal ways.  So, there was definitely some corners cut on the motion capture needed to make this a whole lot more real.  The best part of this is definitely the armor suits, which look spectacular. Beyond this, that's where the CGI begins to fall apart.  Again, the faces look flat and dull, the eyes are too dark and the skin and skin folds and musculature look like a video game.  I was hoping for just a bit more realism in that part of production.ProductionI was hoping for a similar feel to the Paul Verhoeven film. That is, clips of the computer asking 'Would you like to know more?'. Sure, it's been done, but it's also a staple. It sets a tone and a mood. It's what makes a Starship Trooper film a Starship Trooper film. These segments are like segues that lead you to the next segment. They hook them together. There was no tying element like this in ST Invasion. In fact, there wasn't much of an invasion actually.OverallThe movie would have made a good pilot episode to begin a TV series. It sets up enough characters that you feel it could turn into a well done series about this set of troopers who do their own private battles in a specific area of combat.  Not all mobile infantry are just grunts that are expendable.  There have to be a more elite class that do special ops.  So, here was a great opportunity to focus on one of those special ops groups.  Instead, the movie just floundered into way too familiar and predictable territory instead of taking a chance and becoming something great.",4,Would have made a decent pilot for a series,1356134400,"12 22, 2012",2012,4491,"['generally', 'liked', 'film', 'story', 'needed', 'lot', 'more', 'work', 'pilot', 'TV', 'series', 'story', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'fine', 'More', 'fine', 'actually', 'full', 'length', 'feature', 'film', 'needed', 'whole', 'lot', 'more', 'work.StoryI', 'did', 'got', 'see', 'Ibanez', 'Rico', 'Carl', 'again', 'characters', 'are', 'really', 'linchpins', 'holding', 'whole', 'movie', 'together', 'problem', 'story', 'just', 'when', 'new', 'trooper', 'characters', 'are', 'introduced', 'are', 'then', 'almost', 'immediately', 'killed', 'off', 'So', 'try', 'invest', 'time', 'new', 'characters', 'only', 'see', 'killed', 'bugs', 'quickly', 'Yes', 'did', 'happen', 'first', 'Starship', 'Troopers', 'not', '5-10', 'minutes', 'meeting', 'character.The', 'story', 'out', 'basically', 'Ibanez', 'ship', 'John', 'A', 'Warden', 'Carl', 'who', 'over', ""'classified"", 'mission', 'course', 'knowing', 'Carl', 'predilection', 'brain', 'bugs', 'can', 'guess', 'where', 'ship', 'So', 'assault', 'mission', 'small', 'asteroid', 'populated', 'familiar', 'infantry', 'bugs', 'meet', 'troop', 'soldiers', 'who', 'manage', 'survive', 'assault', 'leader', 'who', 'being', 'detained', 'trumped', 'up', 'charges', 'So', 'John', 'A', 'Warden', 'missing', 'heck', 'breaks', 'loose', 'Suffice', 'say', 'end', 'up', 'chase', 'Warden', 'meet', 'up', 'deal', 'Carl', 'freaked', 'out', 'state', 'then', 'attempt', 'take', 'control', 'Warden', 'Unfortunately', 'do', 'wrong', 'things', 'brain', 'bug', 'retakes', 'control', 'ship', 'who', 'ultimately', 'Earth.After', 'Rico', 'space', 'station', 'almost', 'rammed', 'Warden', 'way', 'Earth', 'gear', 'up', 'head', 'down', 'ship', 'space', 'station', 'up', 'nukes', ""'just"", 'case', 'So', 'everything', 'bad', 'worse', 'more', 'troopers', 'die', 'nukes', 'are', 'blown', 'sky', 'Rico', 'up', 'playing', 'space', 'cowboy', 'day', 'Ibanez', 'Carl', 'course', 'rest', 'troopers', 'were', 'expendable.This', 'fairly', 'typical', 'shallow', 'cartoon', 'storyline', 'would', 'have', 'worked', 'great', 'introduce', 'characters', 'series', 'standalone', 'production', 'rings', 'very', 'hollow', 'feels', 'produced.Sex', 'ScenesWhile', 'were', 'sex', 'scenes', 'original', 'Paul', 'Verhoeven', 'film', 'was', ""n't"", 'nearly', 'as', 'gratuitous', 'film', 'Frankly', 'was', ""n't"", 'really', 'necessary', 'see', 'CGI', 'characters', 'doing', 'film', 'can', 'work', 'CGI', 'just', 'really', ""n't"", 'work', 'least', 'not', 'characters', 'are', 'lot', 'more', 'photo', 'realistic', 'So', 'frankly', 'scenes', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'left', 'out.GraphicsThe', 'Trooper', 'armor', 'suits', 'are', 'extremely', 'well', 'done', 'metal', 'looks', 'metal', 'suits', 'look', 'very', 'real', 'when', 'are', 'geared', 'up', 'However', 'hands', 'bodies', 'CG', 'characters', 'feel', 'cartoons', 'flat', 'dull', 'unreal', 'mouth', 'movements', 'might', 'as', 'well', 'just', 'be', 'open/close', 'real', 'emotion', 'lips', 'So', 'have', 'feeling', 'solid', 'metal', 'suits', 'weapons', 'space', 'skin', 'bodies', 'look', 'move', 'unreal', 'ways', 'So', 'was', 'definitely', 'corners', 'cut', 'motion', 'capture', 'needed', 'make', 'whole', 'lot', 'more', 'real', 'best', 'part', 'definitely', 'armor', 'suits', 'look', 'spectacular', 'Beyond', 'where', 'CGI', 'fall', 'apart', 'Again', 'look', 'flat', 'dull', 'eyes', 'are', 'too', 'dark', 'skin', 'skin', 'folds', 'musculature', 'look', 'video', 'game', 'was', 'hoping', 'just', 'bit', 'more', 'realism', 'part', 'production.ProductionI', 'was', 'hoping', 'similar', 'feel', 'Paul', 'Verhoeven', 'film', 'clips', 'computer', 'asking', ""'Would"", 'know', 'more', 'Sure', 'been', 'done', 'also', 'staple', 'tone', 'mood', 'what', 'Starship', 'Trooper', 'film', 'Starship', 'Trooper', 'film', 'segments', 'are', 'segues', 'lead', 'next', 'segment', 'hook', 'together', 'was', 'tying', 'element', 'ST', 'Invasion', 'fact', 'was', ""n't"", 'much', 'invasion', 'actually.OverallThe', 'movie', 'would', 'have', 'made', 'good', 'pilot', 'episode', 'begin', 'TV', 'series', 'up', 'enough', 'characters', 'feel', 'could', 'turn', 'well', 'done', 'series', 'set', 'troopers', 'who', 'do', 'own', 'private', 'battles', 'specific', 'area', 'combat', 'Not', 'mobile', 'infantry', 'are', 'just', 'grunts', 'are', 'expendable', 'have', 'be', 'more', 'elite', 'class', 'do', 'special', 'ops', 'So', 'here', 'was', 'great', 'opportunity', 'focus', 'one', 'special', 'ops', 'groups', 'Instead', 'movie', 'just', 'floundered', 'way', 'too', 'familiar', 'predictable', 'territory', 'instead', 'taking', 'chance', 'becoming', 'something', 'great']",N/A

Everything that followed that movie was very cheesy and embarrassing to watch. This was a step up for them since it wasn't a complete failure in terms of artwork and detail. There was nothing really unique about the storyline and after it was over you're left with the idea that it's once again another chapter that doesn't really get anywhere. The makeovers for the three main characters were okay, expressions were okay, animation was good, but the dialogue & acting was a bit poor. Although the artwork and CG was very good, there was nothing about it that was visually stunning. The battle scenes were kind of cool but at times it was losing my interest. It belongs with the B movies on netflix soon. You will have to screen it before letting your children watch it since it had some unnecessary nudity. The way they executed those nude scenes was very corny and stupid. Though being a fan of the orginal movie made me over look past all the negatives I had towards this movie. It entertained me but I can't say I enjoyed it enough to own it. It wasn't totally a bad movie and overall I thought it was okay.

1548572,A2FRKEXDXDN1KI,B0088X7YMS,Dennis A. Amith (kndy),"[0, 0]","In 1959, writer Robert A. Heinlen created the military science fiction novel known as ""Starship Troopers"".  Serialized in ""The Magazine of Fantasy & Science Fiction"", ""Starship Troopers"" was a major inspiration to writers, filmmakers and video game creators.In America, the influence of Heinlen's novel was incorporated to James Cameron's ""Aliens"" and would inspire the creation of three live action films, most notably the Paul Verhoeven film which diverged from the original novel.While in Japan, ""Starship Troopers"" was a major influence to anime creators.  Yoshiyuki Tomino, known for creating the legendary mecha series ""Mobile Suit Gundam"" has cited the novel as an inspiration and in 1988, Sunrise and Bandai Visual created a 6-episode anime OVA series titled ""Uchu no Senshi"" (which translates to ""Starship Troopers""), a series that was faithful to Heinlen's original novel.The original novel was focused on a young soldier from the Philippines named Juan ""Johnnie"" Rico and his adventures as part of the Mobile Infantry and his rise in his military career during a time when mankind is in war against an arachnoid specials known as ""The Bugs"".With its acknowledged major influence to Japanese science fiction, nearly 25-years-later since the ""Uchuu no Senshi"" animated OVA series, ""Starship Troopers"" once again goes back to Japan for a CG-animated film titled ""Starship Troopers: Invasion"".  But this collaboration was also with the United States.Directed by Shinji Aramaki (""Appleseed"", """"Megazone 23 Part III"", ""Genesis Survivor Gaiarth"", ""Bubblegum Crisis"") and a man known for his work on many of the Japan's popular mecha anime hits, Aramaki's direction is based on the written work of Edward Neumeier (who wrote the previous films in the series) and executive producer and actor Casper Van Dien (best known for playing Johnny Rico in the live action films).  The animation and motion capturing was done in Japan courtesy of SOLA Digital Arts.The CG animated film would feature the return of characters Johnny Rico, Carl Jenkins and Carmen Ibanez but following the adventures of the A-1 Team.VIDEO:Having watched a good number of CG animation from Japan, it's always great to see how technology has continued to get better and better with the models and textures since the release of Shinji Aramaki's previous effort on ""Appleseed"".  There was no doubt that ""Appleseed"" broke new ground for CG animation in Japan and for Aramaki, he continues to be a major legend in the industry because of his work on the greatest mecha anime series and to have him work on ""Starship Troopers: Invasion"" is fantastic, if you are an anime fan!With SOLA Digital Arts, Inc. working on the animation and that the company literally flew all American actors to Japan for motion capturing, I'm just amazed how far CG animation has come since ""Final Fantasy: The Spirits Within"", ""Final Fantasy: Advent Children"" to the ""Appleseed"" related films to this current animated film, ""Starship Troopers: Invasion"".Presented in 1080p High Definition (1:78:1 aspect ratio), the film looks absolutely amazing in HD.  The detail of the characters show skin pores, the movements are not as jerky as they were years ago.  Movements are smooth, emotions of characters are much more evident and natural and there is this less blank look on the faces of the characters.From the characters to the aliens, they are heavily detailed, especially with mechanical design.  Aramaki's experience is in mechanical design, so it helps to have him as the driving force and getting people to give their 100% in making the vehicles look amazing.I didn't notice any banding or artifacts or edge enhancement.  If anything, the picture quality for ""Starship Troopers: Invasion"" is fantastic on Blu-ray!AUDIO:The lossless soundtrack is presented in English, French and Portuguese 5.1 DTS-HD MA, Spanish, Thai and Japanese 5.1 Dolby Digital.  The soundtrack was very good, with good use of the surround channels as this is an action-packed film featuring explosions, gunshots, laser blasts that come up often throughout the film.  Dialogue and music is crystal clear through the center and front channels.  But I wish the soundtrack was much more immersive.  I was hoping more more LFE and directional effects but I really felt the lossless soundtrack could have been a lot better for this series, as I had high expectations for ""Starship Troopers: Invasion"" to be immersive for its sheer number of action scenes.The soundtrack also comes with quite a few language dubs but for the English lossless soundtrack, you have well-known anime voice talents such as Luci Christian, David Matranga and Emily Neves involved.  But for those hoping Casper Van Dien or other talents from the previous films voicing their roles, this is not the case for ""Starship Troopers: Invasion"".Subtitles are in English, English SDH, French, Chinese (Mandarin/Simplified and Traditional), Indonesia/Bahasa, Korean, Portuguese, Spanish and Thai.SPECIAL FEATURES:""Starship Troopers: Invasion"" comes with the following special features:Filmmaker Commentary - Featuring the Japanese audio commentary with director Shinji Aramaki and Ishizuka of Sony Pictures.Conceptual Art Gallery - Featuring a slideshow of concept artDeleted Scenes - (1:36) Featuring two deleted scenes: ""I Don't Like Funerals"" and ""Marzijon Wormhole"".Gag Reel - (3:24) English voice dubbing outtakesThe Making of ""Starship Troopers: Invasion"" - (1:19:59) Featuring the making of the CG animated film broken down to the following parts that can be viewed separately or together: ""Genesis"", ""Archive"", ""Character Design"", ""Motion Capture"", ""Power Suits"", ""Bugs"", ""Ships"", ""Backgrounds"", ""Compositing"" and ""Music"".EXTRAS:""Starship Troopers: Invasion"" comes with an UltraViolet code which allows you to stream the film to computers, tablets or smartphones and download to your computer.JUDGMENT CALL:""Starship Troopers: Invasion"" is a film that visually, looks great and non-stop action that fans of the genres will enjoy.But the film felt like I was watching cut scenes for a first-person shooter.  A storyline that focused so much on the action that very little was left of the plot.  What it turns out to be is another banal storyline of humanity trying to survive against an alien infestation, another film like ""Aliens"", like ""Predator"" and wondering which characters would ultimately survive.But ""Starship Troopers"", especially for the films, have been stories that deviated from the original novels, anyone expecting a return to Robert A. Heinlein's work may be disappointed, while those who grew up watching the Edward Neumeier written films will probably enjoy ""Starship Troopers: Invasion"" a lot.  Especially anime fans who are used to seeing these type of action films.I want to make it clear that I enjoyed ""Starship Troopers: Invasion"".  For one, I was not expecting a deep storyline but I did enjoy the visual aspect of the film but also its characters.  Granted, a well-written plot and giving more depth and attention to character development would have made this film much deeper, but ""Starship Troopers"" to many people who have never read the novel is about warfare, about action and a storyline that is filled with sex and violence and team bravado as humanity takes on the aliens that continue to threaten them.Like the live-action films, there is a lot of violence in ""Starship Troopers: Invasion"" as no matter how efficient the armor of the soldiers are, the aliens are even deadlier as soldiers are constantly getting impaled and no matter how many bullets hits these aliens, they are relentless.As for the sex, director Shinji Aramaki discusses in the audio commentary of how there were questions by female staff of how much nudity was featured in first half-hour of the film.  Literally, the three female characters which consist of Captain Carmen Ibanez, Ice Blonde and Trig are seen nude in the film.  And while some viewers will roll their eyes of the amount of female nudity this film has to offer, sex and violence will no doubt be its strength to a core demographic who love first person shooter video games and films with intense action.  It's how it is and Shinji Aramaki and Japanese crew followed Edward Neumeier's script to incorporate as much sex and violence as possible.But another reason why I enjoyed this film was its CG animation.  I have watched many CG animated films come from Japan and the technology continues to get better and better and I'm just in awe of how beautiful these CG renderings are and how much work went to making this film looks visually stunning.And on Blu-ray, the film looks absolutely fantastic but I wish the lossless soundtrack would have complimented the amount of action as seen in the film.  This film has so much action, I wanted immersiveness.  I wanted to feel these explosions and hear the directional fire coming from my surround and rear surround channels and bullets zipping from left to right and vice versa.  And I admit that I was a bit disappointed that with amazing visuals, the lossless soundtrack was not stellar as it could have been.  But you do get a number of special features that made the film worth its while and once again, I did enjoy it.I know already that by the look of this film alone, ""Starship Troopers: Invasion"" was not cheap.  Having this collaboration between the East and West working together is great but at the same time, there is no doubt that this film needs to make its money back, especially if there are talks of how successful this film does, more will be made.It would be great if more can be made as I surely enjoyed this film much better than the second and third installment of the ""Starship Troopers"" films.  It's pretty much a popcorn action film that will appeal to ""Starship Troopers"" fans and also those who want to see an all-action, violent CG animated film and throw in the titillating nudity as well!Overall, ""Starship Troopers: Invasion"" is an exciting CG animated film collaboration between Japan and the United States featuring non-stop action, amazing visuals and a fast-paced storyline.  It may not be deep and it may not satisfy those who are familiar with the original novel but it's still an entertaining CG animated film that action fans will definitely want to check out!",4,"(3.5

I am disappointed that CGI was their only option (?), although at this point almost anything will do.  I love this series enough that I will put up with it.  As far as the story goes, it's a bit choppy.  After a few seconds of non-action signifying absolutely nothing, the story coughs up another start: 48 hours earlier.  A rescue mission is called for, quickly followed by a hijacking, then a rogue vessel crawling with bugs is on a direct course to Earth, Paris to be exact (oui-oui, the bugs want a vacation).  The pace is quick, the cast of cartoon characters are impossible to tell apart (even though handy little name tags are attached to each suit), and the action is ridiculously repetitive.  There's a lot of macho posturing, the dialog isn't exactly sterling (""do me a favor, don't get killed""), and the female characters are depicted either nude or dressed as dominatrixes.  Naturally, nukes are considered as the only possible solution (the all-purpose Sci-fi answer to every infestation).  The CGI isn't stellar; the people look like puppets; facial expressions are limited, and in the case of General/Dr. Carl the psychic, downright creepy.  At best, the artwork is serviceable.If they put out another film like this one, I'd buy it (something is better than nothing).",4,"""Is that a real five minutes or a sort of five minutes?""",1371340800,"06 16, 2013",2013,1411,"['substitute', 'live', 'action', 'films', 'series', 'Invasion', 'not', 'much', 'offering', 'beggars', 'ca', ""n't"", 'be', 'choosey', 'am', 'disappointed', 'CGI', 'was', 'only', 'option', 'point', 'almost', 'anything', 'will', 'do', 'love', 'series', 'will', 'put', 'up', 'As', 'far', 'story', 'bit', 'choppy', 'few', 'seconds', 'non-action', 'signifying', 'absolutely', 'nothing', 'story', 'up', 'start', '48', 'hours', 'earlier', 'rescue', 'mission', 'called', 'quickly', 'followed', 'hijacking', 'then', 'rogue', 'vessel', 'crawling', 'bugs', 'direct', 'course', 'Earth', 'Paris', 'be', 'exact', 'oui-oui', 'bugs', 'want', 'vacation', 'pace', 'quick', 'cast', 'cartoon', 'characters', 'are', 'impossible', 'tell', 'apart', 'even', 'handy', 'little', 'name', 'tags', 'are', 'attached', 'suit', 'action', 'ridiculously', 'repetitive', 'lot', 'macho', 'posturing', 'dialog', ""n't"", 'exactly', 'sterling', 'do', 'favor', 'do', ""n't"", 'get', 'killed', 'female', 'characters', 'are', 'depicted', 'nude', 'dressed', 'dominatrixes', 'Naturally', 'nukes', 'are', 'considered', 'only', 'possible', 'solution', 'all-purpose', 'Sci-fi', 'answer', 'infestation', 'CGI', ""n't"", 'stellar', 'people', 'look', 'puppets', 'facial', 'expressions', 'are', 'limited', 'case', 'General/Dr', 'Carl', 'psychic', 'downright', 'creepy', 'best', 'artwork', 'serviceable.If', 'put', 'out', 'film', 'one', ""'d"", 'buy', 'something', 'better', 'nothing']",N/A

1548589,AVWU1O6TH3SXG,B0088X7YMS,"J. McGinn ""HUNTSMAN""","[7, 9]","Starship Troopers: Invasion is a breath of fresh air from the previous from the three previous films. I've been a fan of Starship Troopers since I first saw the film Starship Troopers back when it came out in November of 1997 a few weeks before the very disappointing Alien Resurrection. It wasn't a great film, but it was fun and entertaining with Denise Richards and two of my favorite actors in Michael Ironside and Neil Patrick Harris. Michael Ironside I think is a little known actor, but you might recognize him from his voice acting as he was the voice of Darkside in the Superman and Justice League cartoon series along with his work as Sam Fisher in the Splinter Cell series. Then there is the one and only Neil Patrick Harris who I've followed since I watched him in Doogie Howser. He really is special multi-talented actor who enjoys what he does. Heck was the best thing in the Harold and Kumar films, and the only reason to watch How I Met Your Mother. Though I enjoyed the movie I hadn't read Robert A. Heinlein novel the film was based off of. After the film I picked up the novel and loved it. Starship Troopers had little in common with Heinlein's novel besides a few things like the main character Rico. Seven years later Starship Troopers 2: Hero of the Federation a film that should never have been made was released to DVD. The plot wasn't terrible, but the acting and effects were just god awful. After the crap fest that was Starship Troopers 2 Bold Films and Stage 6 thought it was a good idea to make Starship Troopers 3: Marauder. The film worked out well bring back Casper Van Dien and bringing in the hot Jolene Blalock along with a decent script, good acting, and above average effects, but even with that it was still just an average film, so I was surprised to hear there was another film coming out especially that I heard very little about it, but when I saw it at Red Box I decided to give it a try, and I was very pleasantly surprised.As I said earlier in my review Starship Troopers: Invasion is a surprisingly really good film. The story follows the starship Alesia and their group of marines as they arrive at The Federation asteroid base Fort Casey, which has been overrun by bugs. It seems like a simple job for Lieutenant Tony Daugherty and his men, but things get complicated when Carl Jenkins the Minister of Paranormal Warfare commandeers the John A. Warden from his longtime Friend Carmen Ibanez and disappears. The Alesia her marines, Carmen and the prisoner Major Henry Varro chase after him on orders from General Johnny Rico. The story follows the universe of the films as it is a continuation. I won't give anymore way except to say the story is great, but better than the three previous films. The only real flaw with the film was the characters. That is a problem with films with a ton of characters like war films. For example The Thin Red Line it's a really good film, but is really hurt by the overabundance of characters. There are a lot of characters in Starship Troopers: Invasion to many for having real character growth. Many don't live long enough for you to care. Still there are some that stand out like Trig the women sniper of the team, and a private nicknamed Holyman. Obviously he is a religious man, and he was a good character. Of course the returning characters were good as well including Rico, Carmen and Carl. I wish studio that made the film had gotten Casper, Denise and especially Neil to do the voices of the characters. Still the voice actors did a good job voicing the characters, and it was interesting to see how the characters have grown and changed. The only character I didn't really like was Major Henry Varro nicknamed ""Hero"". The writers tried to make you care about him, but it didn't work he just felt like a useless character.Of course with this movie being a computer animated film I have to talk about the animation along with the action. Now I'm no expert in graphics or animation, so I only go by what I think is good, and in my opinion the computer animation was great. The film was really detailed, and you could see the expressions and emotion along with the pain and sadness in the characters faces. The detail of the ships and bases was really well done as well. Then there was the action, which there was of course a lot of, and it was brilliantly done with the bugs, explosions, fire fights and bloodshed. It is riveting and even if the characters aren't the best in the world the action will keep you glued to the film.Starship Troopers: Invasion overall is a great film, with great animation and action along with a really good story, good voice acting and decent characters. It is definitely the best Starship Troopers film I highly recommend everyone see especially if you're a fan of the films and book, but is it the best adaption of Robert A. Heinlein's classic novel no. That honor goes to Roughnecks: Starship Troopers Chronicles the excellent 1999 animated series that ran for 36 episodes. Sadly it got canceled before it could come to a conclusion. It uses the characters from the films, but takes a different route that works really well along with the animation which was great. The series goes in depth into the character's lives as well as brings some characters from the novel as well as introducing new ones. I highly recommend both this film and the animated series if you're a fan of the novel and films or you're a Sci-fi fan in general.",5,A Breath of Fresh Air.,1346803200,"09 5,

If you want to think, I recommend hunting up a copy of the original 1959 Starship Troopers novel by Robert Heinlein that the franchise is loosely based on.If you are interested in leaving your brain at the door and going along for the thrill ride - and I'm not being insulting here - then Starship Troopers: Invasion is just the movie for you.Invasion is an action-oriented animated CGI that centers on intrepid space marines of the Mobile Infantry. Fan favorite Johnny Rico returns from the live action `Starship Troopers', and now holds the rank of General; he is voiced by a different actor, so don't be expecting Casper Van Dien.Other returning characters from the first live action movie include Carl Jenkins and Carman Ibanez. The remaining characters are all new and exclusive to Invasion.Executive produced by Edward Neumeier (writer of the original Troopers film) and Casper Van Dien (Johnny Rico), the movie is standalone, acting as an almost direct sequel to the original Starship Troopers, with no mention of the 2nd (Hero of the Federation) and 3rd (Marauder) sequels.The CGI animation as compared to the Starship Troopers: Roughneck Chronicles series, is far superior. The plot is standard. The voice acting is standard. Action sequences are well executed. The bug splatter spray is commendable. The troopers now use combat shock frames, which is a nod to the novel's concept of space marines in battle armor, unlike the first film that opted for helmets and protective vests.What starts out as a simple assignment to take back a compromised outpost quickly escalates into a wider mission: why has the starship John A. Warden suddenly gone off the grid? And why is the starship heading directly for Earth? The plot has decent enough pacing, with action scenes interspersed throughout.I enjoyed the film and recommend Starship Troopers Invasion for fans of: space marines, Starship Troopers, space adventure.",4,C'Mon You Apes!,1346716800,"09 4, 2012",2012,2086,"['Starship', 'Troopers', 'Invasion', 'what', 'like', 'refer', 'fluffy', 'popcorn', 'movie.If', ""'re"", 'looking', 'movie', 'think', 'then', 'Invasion', 'not', 'want', 'think', 'recommend', 'hunting', 'up', 'copy', 'original', '1959', 'Starship', 'Troopers', 'novel', 'Robert', 'Heinlein', 'franchise', 'loosely', 'based', 'on.If', 'are', 'interested', 'leaving', 'brain', 'door', 'going', 'along', 'thrill', 'ride', ""'m"", 'not', 'being', 'insulting', 'here', 'then', 'Starship', 'Troopers', 'Invasion', 'just', 'movie', 'you.Invasion', 'action-oriented', 'animated', 'CGI', 'intrepid', 'space', 'marines', 'Mobile', 'Infantry', 'Fan', 'favorite', 'Johnny', 'Rico', 'returns', 'live', 'action', 'Starship', 'Troopers', 'now', 'rank', 'General', 'voiced', 'different', 'actor', 'so', 'do', ""n't"", 'be', 'expecting', 'Casper', 'Van', 'Dien.Other', 'returning', 'characters', 'first', 'live', 'action', 'movie', 'include', 'Carl', 'Jenkins', 'Carman', 'Ibanez', 'remaining', 'characters', 'are', 'new', 'exclusive', 'Invasion.Executive', 'produced', 'Edward', 'Neumeier', 'writer', 'original', 'Troopers', 'film', 'Casper', 'Van', 'Dien', 'Johnny', 'Rico', 'movie', 'standalone', 'acting', 'almost', 'direct', 'sequel', 'original', 'Starship', 'Troopers', 'mention', '2nd', 'Hero', 'Federation', '3rd', 'Marauder', 'sequels.The', 'CGI', 'animation', 'compared', 'Starship', 'Troopers', 'Roughneck', 'Chronicles', 'series', 'far', 'superior', 'plot', 'standard', 'voice', 'acting', 'standard', 'Action', 'sequences', 'are', 'well', 'executed', 'bug', 'splatter', 'spray', 'commendable', 'troopers', 'now', 'use', 'combat', 'shock', 'frames', 'nod', 'novel', 'concept', 'space', 'marines', 'battle', 'armor', 'first', 'film', 'opted', 'helmets', 'protective', 'vests.What', 'out', 'simple', 'assignment', 'take', 'back', 'compromised', 'outpost', 'quickly', 'wider', 'mission', 'why', 'starship', 'John', 'A', 'Warden', 'suddenly', 'gone', 'off', 'grid', 'why', 'starship', 'heading', 'directly', 'Earth', 'plot', 'decent', 'enough', 'pacing', 'action', 'scenes', 'interspersed', 'throughout.I', 'enjoyed', 'film', 'recommend', 'Starship', 'Troopers', 'Invasion', 'fans', 'space', 'marines', 'Starship', 'Troopers', 'space', 'adventure']",N/A

I too loved the movie and found it to be one of the most original science fiction films released in some time. The sequel was okay but then it became more of a franchise and less of a story. A series of CGI cartoons followed on TV and that ended up becoming feature length CGI cartoons like this one, STARSHIP TROOPERS-INVASION.A group of troopers are sent aboard a stranded space vessel to recover a squad sent in to rescue a prisoner and his guard. They don't know why, they just follow orders. Both are retrieved and a swarm of ""bugs"" attack them, taking out a few members and wounding another. They make it back to their ship but something is wrong.One of two ships involved here goes dark and the troopers are sent in to find out what's happening. To their dismay they find more ""bugs"" and a problem bigger than they expected to find.Okay so that's a small description of what this film is all about but in truth it doesn't take much more than that to explain. What we have here isn't so much about story or furthering the mythology behind the series. Instead we have tons of explosions and gun battles involving humans versus ""bugs"". Honestly that gets pretty boring after a while, even more so when even the humans are CGI.Just to make sure the film gets an R rating (as if the violence weren't enough) a couple of nude shots are inserted as well. If naked CGI women are your thing then by all means, pick this movie up. You'll want to freeze frame on those scenes where most of us sit and wonder why anyone would find the need to make them in the first place.It's a shame that movies like this get made while other more deserving films sit in limbo waiting to be made. My guess would be that it costs little to make, that most of the programming for the CGI was in the computers already and they thought they could get a nice return on investment by making this. Fans of the original will find no reason to seek this out. Fans of science fiction will not find much to like either.

Three principal characters from the Starship Troopers series, Carmen Ibanez, Carl Jenkins and Johnny Rico appear, but their roles are relatively small, in the film's first half in particular.The story goes like this. Earth Federation Force troopers led by Lieutenant Tony Daugherty (Sam Roman) are sent to Federation's outpost Fort Casey that was attacked by bugs. One of the survivors is Carl Jenkins (Justin Doran), ministry of Paranormal Warfare, who takes over the command of the Starship John A. Warden from Carmen Ibanez (Luci Christian), and leaves the bug-infested base without telling what happened.After the mission, Johnny Rico (David Matranga) - he is General Rico now - gives a new assignment to Carmen and the trooper team on the fast attack ship Alesia. John A. Warden is missing, and they have to find the starship and Carl.The story of the 89 minute film is fast-paced but sometimes confusing and cluttered with too many characters. The weapon designs (trooper's powered suit and Marauders) are impressive, and so are the production designs of the starships, but CG-rendered human characters leave much to be desired. The faces of the characters barely escape the so-called ""uncanny valley,"" but still sometimes look lifeless.The combat scenes are mostly acceptable, but don't expect intensity of Paul Verhoeven's live-action version, which remains the best of the series. The battle scenes with Arachnids get repetitious as the story goes on, and sometimes movements of bugs and humans look a bit awkward. And ... do we need a shower scene here? (The film includes nudity.)""Starship Troopers: Invasion"" is executive-produced by Casper Van Dien and Edward Neumeier, the writer of all three ""Starship Trooper"" films. Casper Van Dien, who played Johnny Rico in the first and third films, does not appear in this animated film, which was shot in Japan in May, 2011, using the motion capture technologies. The film's visuals are by Sola Digital Arts, Inc., a studio founded in Japan in 2010.
