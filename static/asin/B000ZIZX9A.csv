1122641,A3GKMQFL05Z79K,B000ZIZX9A,blackaciddevil,"[0, 0]","Ben Tennyson is on summer vacation, traveling around the country with his grandfather Max and his cousin Gwen. During this vacation, Ben has become owner of a device called the Omnitrix, which he can use to turn into any one of 10 (and more) super-powered aliens. Since then, Ben's fought a lot of sinister villains, and he's saved the world several times. Still, summer's not over yet. Season 3, like Season 2, picks up where the last season leaves off. Only, this season, we go on adventures like never before. This time around, we see Team Tennyson in the distant future(as adults & older adult no less) as well as Team Tennyson heading to outer space in an attempt to save the Earth from total darkness among other things. Not only that but we find out many revelations in this seasons episodes that might change things for The Tennysons. In this season, Ben has to use his wits alot more and not just his powers to save the day. Extras, I'm afraid, are a bit less this season. There's a couple of deleted scenes, a handful of Ben 10 promos, a preview for the live-action Ben 10: Race Against Time DVD(which is excellent, btw), and a slideshow of alien designs. There's plenty of superhero action this season. Will not disappoint you in the least, I assure you.

Shows like Kids Next Door, and Foster's Home for Imaginary Friends, two shows okay for kids, but left me talking to them about the cartoons that ""I"" watched when I was their age: The Herculoids, Space Ghost, etc. They sat there listening to me talk about these shows, and how cool they were to me, when my youngest nephew says ""Ben 10"". I asked them what that was and they tell me its about a boy that can turn into 10 alien monsters to fight bad guys, kinda like the cartoons that I watched, but way better! It comes on right after Foster's. Well an hour later (they showed two episodes in a row of Ben 10) I was hooked! Ben 10 has a very interesting storyline (even for adults), and very cool Alien/Monster designs. The two episodes I watched dealt with ""Ghostfreak"" one of Ben's aliens escaping from the Omnitrix, and trying to merge its form with Ben's so it can survive in the sunlight, and commit horrible things. This was actually kind of a creepy character, and a dark story, I loved it! And so did the kids. As I said before, I was hooked! I watched this show every chance that I could with them, and now I own them all in the 3 DVD sets that have been released so far.If you are an adult that still likes cartoons, or just want to have something that is very fun, and entertaining for the kids to watch, you need to get Ben 10!",5,"Relivin' Saturday Morning FUN with your nephews, and nieces",1207958400,"04 12, 2008",2008,1448,"['was', 'watching', 'TV', 'Cartoon', 'Network', 'course', 'younger', 'brother', 'boys', 'younger', 'sister', 'girls', 'Shows', 'Kids', 'Next', 'Door', 'Foster', 'Home', 'Imaginary', 'Friends', 'two', 'shows', 'okay', 'kids', 'left', 'talking', 'cartoons', 'watched', 'when', 'was', 'age', 'Herculoids', 'Space', 'Ghost', 'etc', 'sat', 'listening', 'talk', 'shows', 'how', 'cool', 'were', 'when', 'youngest', 'nephew', 'Ben', '10', 'asked', 'what', 'was', 'tell', 'boy', 'can', 'turn', '10', 'alien', 'monsters', 'fight', 'bad', 'guys', 'kinda', 'cartoons', 'watched', 'way', 'better', 'right', 'Foster', 'Well', 'hour', 'later', 'showed', 'two', 'episodes', 'row', 'Ben', '10', 'was', 'hooked', 'Ben', '10', 'very', 'interesting', 'storyline', 'even', 'adults', 'very', 'cool', 'Alien/Monster', 'designs', 'two', 'episodes', 'watched', 'dealt', 'Ghostfreak', 'one', 'Ben', 'aliens', 'escaping', 'Omnitrix', 'trying', 'merge', 'form', 'Ben', 'can', 'survive', 'sunlight', 'commit', 'horrible', 'things', 'was', 'actually', 'kind', 'creepy', 'character', 'dark', 'story', 'loved', 'so', 'did', 'kids', 'said', 'was', 'hooked', 'watched', 'show', 'chance', 'could', 'now', 'own', '3', 'DVD', 'sets', 'have', 'been', 'released', 'so', 'far.If', 'are', 'adult', 'still', 'cartoons', 'just', 'want', 'have', 'something', 'very', 'fun', 'entertaining', 'kids', 'watch', 'need', 'get', 'Ben', '10']",Ben 10: The Complete Season 3
