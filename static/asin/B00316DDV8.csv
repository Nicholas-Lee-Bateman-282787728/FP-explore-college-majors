1316862,A33EN2ZL2MS0CI,B00316DDV8,Compay,"[13, 14]","Toxic Skies is one of those straight-to-video movies that is a step above most Redbox fare.  For being a low budget film shot in Canada, this movie has great cinematography and editing.  Kevin Blumenfeld also did a top-notch job with the movie's score.Canadian director Andrew C. Erin doesn't have many movies under his belt, but he's definitely talented.  I had seen his directing work before in Tornado Valley, only he's working with a better cast in this film.  Anne Heche gives a solid performance as Dr. Tess Martin, a virologist struggling to discover the truth behind a deadly illness.  Daniel Bacon also shines as Dr. Raj Patel, her friend and fellow physician.So why give a film with a solid cast and great directing only three stars?  The story is lacking.  Toxic Skies cobbles a few elements from the movie ""Outbreak"", particularly why it becomes personally important for Tess to quickly discover a cure.  On one hand, I give Andrew Erin credit for choosing such an original danger (chemtrails), but the movie isn't as suspenseful as it could have been.  The film touches on an important motivation of Tess' physician work, yet never returns to it.  There just seemed like great potential for backstories, or learning more about the two main doctors in general.Toxic Skies is definitely worth watching once, before you decide whether or not to buy the DVD.  With the cast and cinematography, I think it had the potential of a five-star film, if only the writing had been better.  It's still an under the radar movie that's worth checking out.",3,Average Writing - But a Great Presentation,1273622400,"05 12, 2010",2010,1553,"['Toxic', 'Skies', 'one', 'straight-to-video', 'movies', 'step', 'most', 'Redbox', 'fare', 'being', 'low', 'budget', 'film', 'shot', 'Canada', 'movie', 'great', 'cinematography', 'editing', 'Kevin', 'Blumenfeld', 'also', 'did', 'top-notch', 'job', 'movie', 'score.Canadian', 'director', 'Andrew', 'C.', 'Erin', ""n't"", 'have', 'many', 'movies', 'belt', 'definitely', 'talented', 'had', 'seen', 'directing', 'work', 'before', 'Tornado', 'Valley', 'only', 'working', 'better', 'cast', 'film', 'Anne', 'Heche', 'solid', 'performance', 'Dr.', 'Tess', 'Martin', 'virologist', 'struggling', 'discover', 'truth', 'deadly', 'illness', 'Daniel', 'Bacon', 'also', 'Dr.', 'Raj', 'Patel', 'friend', 'fellow', 'physician.So', 'why', 'give', 'film', 'solid', 'cast', 'great', 'directing', 'only', 'three', 'stars', 'story', 'lacking', 'Toxic', 'Skies', 'few', 'elements', 'movie', 'Outbreak', 'particularly', 'why', 'personally', 'important', 'Tess', 'quickly', 'discover', 'cure', 'one', 'hand', 'give', 'Andrew', 'Erin', 'credit', 'choosing', 'such', 'original', 'danger', 'chemtrails', 'movie', ""n't"", 'as', 'suspenseful', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'film', 'touches', 'important', 'motivation', 'Tess', 'physician', 'work', 'yet', 'never', 'just', 'seemed', 'great', 'potential', 'backstories', 'learning', 'more', 'two', 'main', 'doctors', 'general.Toxic', 'Skies', 'definitely', 'worth', 'watching', 'once', 'decide', 'not', 'buy', 'DVD', 'cast', 'cinematography', 'think', 'had', 'potential', 'five-star', 'film', 'only', 'writing', 'had', 'been', 'better', 'still', 'radar', 'movie', 'worth', 'checking', 'out']",N/A

1316865,AIY4H4KWR2KWZ,B00316DDV8,MadMacs,"[3, 4]","I'm not going to judge the whys or attempt to analyze the events, only to note that the career of Anne Heche is certainly one that remains memorable for its incredible downward spiral. Despite her talent, which in my opinion is still considerable, this is one of the best examples I can think of when someone denies there's a conspiracy within Hollywood's surprisingly cloistered mental and political compound. And for a talented actress once teamed with Harrison Ford and Johnny Depp, punishment for ""breaking the rules"" is meted out with projects like this.It's stunning irony that the very industry that proudly decries The Blacklist, used against creators like Dalton Trumbo and Lionel Stander, willingly continues to do so on the sly against current artists they deem ""inappropriate"". Will they feel shame 40 years down the road? I think so.My hope is that there will be another Tarantino, a renegade filmmaker who will scoop from the so-called bottom and uplift solid talents, bringing them back into the light. Not so much rescuing careers, as acknowledging and revealing the new Hollywood shame and hypocrisy.'Skies' is essentially a SciFi Saturday filler. The day they set aside for their Disaster & Creature Weekends, fairly innocuous direct-to-video cheapies that offer the gamut of disasters, aliens and monsters. Sometimes, like this flick, a government conspiracy.Tells the story of medical researchers and doctors who are battling a new plague - but whose origins seem to be less biologically based and more chemical; less a natural mutation of a known disease and one more likely linked to an artificial source.A bulldog reporter and brilliant physician seem to be working toward the same conclusion - that the government is collaborating with various chemical companies for a sinister purpose. I won't spoil the reason for those interested in viewing the production.There are standard fare action elements that Director Andrew Erin is attempting, including the '24' multiple shot composition. But the flick's timing is molasses slow and, ultimately, wasted effort. Sadly, one of the key 'characters', the disease itself, seems to be a background player when it should've been one of the leads. It's not all that expensive to show people collapsing, blood being vomited, scared and terrified medical personnel refusing to go into trauma centers, etc, etc. But that dramatic energy is only hinted at, not delved into. Definitely a missed opportunity.Interesting premise unfortunately told on multiple doses of Valium. Slow, slow, slow. The movie endless drags out the story and cannot gain traction. Much tighter editing and this might've worked. It happens every blue moon that a SciFi Saturday Special hits the target.

She was once a AA list actress, but at this point she's taking what she can get. IT's the way for most actors really. Chem trails which are not real  are the focus of this one. Unlike frakking in which real chemicals are pumped into the ground to get oil , chemtrails are a nutcase theory in which chemicals are put into airplines fules tanks to poison everyone. But if  you put chemicals into the tanks , you  would hurt the engines etc and ti's not a good conspiracy really.

Toxic Skies presents a different look at a different scenario of the contamination of the earth.  A couple days ago, on Google News I read that the Politicians have now officially recognized and stated that &#34;global warming&#34; is a danger to life on earth.  This year, 2014, we have seen excessive heat in the Spring particularly in the West, a colder than normal winter, higher food prices due to crops failing, etc.People are getting sick and dying in Toxic Skies.  Anne Heche is brought in as a virologist to study the problem.  Patients blood work shows a high concentration of chemicals.  Since antibiotics aren't working she and her colleagues are trying to get the chemicals out of the systems of the patients to save their lives.  This movie is a warning to folks.  Chemicals kill and if we don't know if now we better learn it sooner than later.I was accidentally exposed to dangerous chemicals in my office administration job in Chicago.  My heart, lungs and kidneys were damaged.  I finally was sent to a doctor specializing in environmental allergens.  I was literally dying and she told me &#34;get the chemicals out of your system.&#34;  We proceeded to do that and I have progressed to where I am not totally dependent on anyone.We are so quick to look at a disaster movie, label it as fiction and move on with our lives.
