896926,ACXHNOC6L8LUO,B000803BQ2,Artist & Author,"[2, 3]","One problem with movies like these is that it cannot show anywhere near the reality of the situation.  For example, no matter how a migraine headache is depicted on screen, it cannot even approximate the debilitating pain for the sufferer, or the emotional affects on family members.  Of course, there would be little point in making a movie about the pain or the hardships of an illness or injury such as Brooke suffered.  However, by focusing almost solely on the successes, all these 'overcoming physical disability' movies become more fiction than truth.  For example, I commented to my wife when Brooke and her mother had an argument that they must have had greater patience than Job to go from age eleven to twenty-one before they had one.My philosophy is that one must experience the dark to be able to value the light; one must know what male is to appreciate the female (and vise versa).  Similarly, one must understand what suffering is to be able to treasure pleasure.  Therein, I think, lies the real value of this movie.  Although it is supposed to be an inspirational story of overcoming adversity, for the vast majority of people it will help them more consciously value their physical abilities.  Try nodding your head; then think of Brooke being unable to even do that.  Doesn't it make you a bit more appreciative of nodding and the million other things you do every day without thinking?Of course, the movie can serve to provide some inspiration to young people who are seriously injured.  Parents may want to show the movie to such kids.  However, it should be remembered that one's injured child will be very aware of their own pain, both physical and emotional, so parents need to be mindful that this movie cannot adequately depict that element.  Otherwise, it could serve to discourage the injured kid because Brooke seems, on screen, to have it so much easier.In short, I think this is a bittersweet story that is equally not as likely as it is likely to provide inspiration to a injured child.",4,A Bittersweet Story,1156809600,"08 29, 2006",2006,2019,"['One', 'problem', 'movies', 'can', 'not', 'show', 'anywhere', 'reality', 'situation', 'example', 'matter', 'how', 'migraine', 'headache', 'depicted', 'screen', 'can', 'not', 'even', 'approximate', 'debilitating', 'pain', 'sufferer', 'emotional', 'affects', 'family', 'members', 'course', 'would', 'be', 'little', 'point', 'making', 'movie', 'pain', 'hardships', 'illness', 'injury', 'such', 'Brooke', 'suffered', 'However', 'focusing', 'almost', 'solely', 'successes', ""'overcoming"", 'physical', 'disability', 'movies', 'become', 'more', 'fiction', 'truth', 'example', 'commented', 'wife', 'when', 'Brooke', 'mother', 'had', 'argument', 'must', 'have', 'had', 'greater', 'patience', 'Job', 'go', 'age', 'eleven', 'twenty-one', 'had', 'one.My', 'philosophy', 'one', 'must', 'experience', 'dark', 'be', 'able', 'value', 'light', 'one', 'must', 'know', 'what', 'male', 'appreciate', 'female', 'vise', 'versa', 'Similarly', 'must', 'understand', 'what', 'suffering', 'be', 'able', 'treasure', 'pleasure', 'Therein', 'think', 'real', 'value', 'movie', 'supposed', 'be', 'inspirational', 'story', 'overcoming', 'adversity', 'vast', 'majority', 'people', 'will', 'help', 'more', 'consciously', 'value', 'physical', 'abilities', 'Try', 'nodding', 'head', 'then', 'think', 'Brooke', 'being', 'unable', 'even', 'do', ""n't"", 'make', 'bit', 'more', 'appreciative', 'nodding', 'million', 'other', 'things', 'do', 'day', 'thinking', 'course', 'movie', 'can', 'serve', 'provide', 'inspiration', 'young', 'people', 'who', 'are', 'seriously', 'injured', 'Parents', 'may', 'want', 'show', 'movie', 'such', 'kids', 'However', 'should', 'be', 'remembered', 'one', 'injured', 'child', 'will', 'be', 'very', 'aware', 'own', 'pain', 'physical', 'emotional', 'parents', 'need', 'be', 'mindful', 'movie', 'can', 'not', 'adequately', 'depict', 'element', 'Otherwise', 'could', 'serve', 'discourage', 'injured', 'kid', 'Brooke', 'screen', 'have', 'so', 'much', 'easier.In', 'short', 'think', 'bittersweet', 'story', 'equally', 'not', 'as', 'likely', 'likely', 'provide', 'inspiration', 'injured', 'child']",N/A

896928,A2VD3CYOEMJ6SR,B000803BQ2,David E. Levine,"[5, 6]","This dvd is an inspriration on many levels. First, Director Christopher Reeve overcame his disability in order to direct and complete this project, which sadly, was his final project. Secondly, the dvd portrays the true story of a young woman, who overcame her own paralysis, to complete school and then, get accepted to and complete her degree at Harvard University (she also continued on to post graduate degrees). Finally, her devoted family is an inspiration. If her mother didn't devote 24 hours, seven days a week to her care, Brooke could not have overcome the physical limitations. Furthermore, her father kept the rest of the family together as he raised Brooke's siblings.I thought that this movie would be difficult to watch. Nothing could be further from the truth. Young Brooke was paralyzed in an accident at the age of 11 and, throughout, her detrmination and optimism are uplifting. Certainly there were problems including red tape with both schooling and medical insurance. Also, the family situation was difficult on her older sister. Nonetheless, the Ellison family is an amazingly strong and devoted family.I have seen Million Dollar Baby which explores many of the issues of disability from a much darker side. I thought that it was also a great movie since the issues of whether to go on or to give up are issues that exist in real life and should, therefore, be explored in movies. However, I am happy that there are people like Brooke who are optimistic and choose not only to go on, but to thrive.A worthwhile feature of the dvd is an interview with Brooke and her mother, Jean. There is also an interview with her father Ed, interspersed within. Truthfully, they don't physically resemble the actresses portraying them in the movie but, that is not important. It is the story that is important and seeing the portrayal as well as the real Brooke Ellison is uplifting. If you are afraid to see this dvd as potentially too depressing to watch, let me assure you that you have nothing to worry about.",5,A true inspiration,1134604800,"12 15, 2005",2005,2023,"['dvd', 'inspriration', 'many', 'levels', 'First', 'Director', 'Christopher', 'Reeve', 'disability', 'order', 'direct', 'complete', 'project', 'sadly', 'was', 'final', 'project', 'Secondly', 'dvd', 'true', 'story', 'young', 'woman', 'who', 'own', 'paralysis', 'complete', 'school', 'then', 'get', 'accepted', 'complete', 'degree', 'Harvard', 'University', 'also', 'continued', 'post', 'graduate', 'degrees', 'Finally', 'devoted', 'family', 'inspiration', 'mother', 'did', ""n't"", 'devote', '24', 'hours', 'seven', 'days', 'week', 'care', 'Brooke', 'could', 'not', 'have', 'overcome', 'physical', 'limitations', 'Furthermore', 'father', 'kept', 'rest', 'family', 'together', 'raised', 'Brooke', 'siblings.I', 'thought', 'movie', 'would', 'be', 'difficult', 'watch', 'Nothing', 'could', 'be', 'further', 'truth', 'Young', 'Brooke', 'was', 'paralyzed', 'accident', 'age', '11', 'detrmination', 'optimism', 'are', 'uplifting', 'Certainly', 'were', 'problems', 'including', 'red', 'tape', 'schooling', 'medical', 'insurance', 'Also', 'family', 'situation', 'was', 'difficult', 'older', 'sister', 'Nonetheless', 'Ellison', 'family', 'amazingly', 'strong', 'devoted', 'family.I', 'have', 'seen', 'Million', 'Dollar', 'Baby', 'many', 'issues', 'disability', 'much', 'darker', 'side', 'thought', 'was', 'also', 'great', 'movie', 'issues', 'go', 'give', 'up', 'are', 'issues', 'exist', 'real', 'life', 'should', 'therefore', 'be', 'explored', 'movies', 'However', 'am', 'happy', 'are', 'people', 'Brooke', 'who', 'are', 'optimistic', 'choose', 'not', 'only', 'go', 'thrive.A', 'worthwhile', 'feature', 'dvd', 'interview', 'Brooke', 'mother', 'Jean', 'also', 'interview', 'father', 'Ed', 'interspersed', 'Truthfully', 'do', ""n't"", 'physically', 'resemble', 'actresses', 'portraying', 'movie', 'not', 'important', 'story', 'important', 'seeing', 'portrayal', 'as', 'well', 'real', 'Brooke', 'Ellison', 'uplifting', 'are', 'afraid', 'see', 'dvd', 'potentially', 'too', 'depressing', 'watch', 'let', 'assure', 'have', 'nothing', 'worry', 'about']",N/A

SHARP,"[16, 18]","Christopher Reeve's penultimate directorial effort is a made-for-TV biopic that attempts to bring a slightly more realistic approach to the genre while hewing fairly closely to the format. In all, Reeve succeeded here.Much of the credit can go to the writing and active participation of Brooke Ellison and her mother and constant caregiver Jean but screenwriter Camille Thomasson also deserves kudos for employing brief but memorable vignettes of the other family members. As the husband of a permanently disabled but determined wife, I know too well how spinal cord injury affects more than just one life. Even though the reality is twenty times more difficult than shown here, it's also just too graphic and downright bleak for family viewing. I strongly suggest watching the interviews provided on this disc to get  just a glimpse of how much Brooke truly overcomes each day.I especially appreciate the honest depiction of flawed people and of the myopia and short tempers this type of life can foster. That the Ellisons achieved so much in spite of their situation is incredible.Vanessa Marano and Lacey Chabert do good work as Brooke (as a child then adult, respectively) but Mastrantonio does most of the heavy lifting as the 24-hour mom and assistant, Jean. Reeve gave her ample time to play her scenes and the discomfort created by some of them is very palpable.The ending is probably the weakest link, falling far too rapidly into LifeTime mode, but it's still worth the ride.

896941,ARXYVR1TPTY6P,B000803BQ2,"TJ-STL ""DVD viewer""","[2, 2]","Emotionally this is a 5 star movie, but upon analysis from my experience it is likely deserving only 3 stars because of what it ignores. That being said it avoided the &#34;true&#34; parts necessary to be called a TRUE STORY. I will surely be dunned for my &#8220;apparent lack of understanding and lack of emotional caring for my opinion&#8221; but read on.In the closing credits they only tell us in 5 words that the husband (Ed) and his wife (Jean) got back together. They never said they divorced! What does together imply?  Jean&#8217;s devotion to the tragic experience her daughter had to live with actually appeared to totally ignore other real life factors. Such as the pain and suffering of her brother (David) and her sister. The truly unselfish person in this tragedy, in my opinion, was the trauma of the husband (Ed)and the underplayed emotions of the two siblings. The husband lost his wife, and had to deal with his other children. He had to spend his life funding the financial support, and responsibility as well as the emotional trauma of Brook&#8217;s brother and sister.I am not ignoring the devotion and physical effort of the mother for Brooks, but the emotional trauma is not fully or truly covered in the movie. The movie ended with Brook&#8217;s, and HER MOTHER, still &#34;going for&#34; her doctorate. This is commendable, but like the &#34;dance&#34; she is all dressed up with no where to go. The rare quadriplegic genius Stephen Hawking could survive and contribute given his astronomical IQ or even Mr. Wunder III with some bicep capabilities and his movie &#8220;Sweepstakes&#8221; are the only exceptions I know of.I had a very beautiful and charismatic handicapped young and beautiful friend in two of my classes in college, and felt I could truly love her for my whole life. She very patiently sat me down, and explained how she could never be tied to, what she and her handicapped friends call &#8220;ablebodies &#8221;. She called it Puppy love which is purely emotional and somewhat selfish of me, and explained in depth that it had no place in physical reality. She had her circle of handicapped friends and eventually married another handicapped man, and while they &#8220;only had no capabilities below their waists&#8221;, they made use of their real life experience, education and with their life&#8217;s knowledge/understanding for dealing with being handicapped, to help others in their situation. They did this through teaching and lecturing in special schools thus aiding the students and parents facing similar problems. FORGIVE ME, but the real world is unforgiving and not as tragic as my friends in the military who suffer even more even with the &#8220;wounded warrior&#8221; program. For these reasons and others, I have many reservations about this movie.I WOULD BE INTERESTED IN ANY &#8220;PRODUCTIVE&#8221; OPINIONS YOU WOULD CARE TO SHARE!",3,Feel good or feel sorry story,1398211200,"04 23, 2014",2014,2897,"['Emotionally', '5', 'star', 'movie', 'analysis', 'experience', 'likely', 'deserving', 'only', '3', 'stars', 'what', 'being', 'said', 'avoided', '34', 'true', '34', 'parts', 'necessary', 'be', 'called', 'TRUE', 'STORY', 'will', 'surely', 'be', 'dunned', '8220', 'apparent', 'lack', 'understanding', 'lack', 'emotional', 'caring', 'opinion', '8221', 'read', 'closing', 'only', 'tell', '5', 'words', 'husband', 'Ed', 'wife', 'Jean', 'got', 'back', 'together', 'never', 'said', 'divorced', 'What', 'together', 'imply', 'Jean', '8217', 'devotion', 'tragic', 'experience', 'daughter', 'had', 'live', 'actually', 'appeared', 'totally', 'ignore', 'other', 'real', 'life', 'factors', 'Such', 'pain', 'suffering', 'brother', 'David', 'sister', 'truly', 'unselfish', 'person', 'tragedy', 'opinion', 'was', 'trauma', 'husband', 'Ed', 'underplayed', 'emotions', 'two', 'siblings', 'husband', 'lost', 'wife', 'had', 'deal', 'other', 'children', 'had', 'spend', 'life', 'funding', 'financial', 'support', 'responsibility', 'as', 'well', 'emotional', 'trauma', 'Brook', '8217', 'brother', 'sister.I', 'am', 'not', 'ignoring', 'devotion', 'physical', 'effort', 'mother', 'Brooks', 'emotional', 'trauma', 'not', 'fully', 'truly', 'covered', 'movie', 'movie', 'ended', 'Brook', '8217', 'HER', 'MOTHER', 'still', '34', 'going', '34', 'doctorate', 'commendable', '34', 'dance', '34', 'dressed', 'up', 'where', 'go', 'rare', 'quadriplegic', 'genius', 'Stephen', 'Hawking', 'could', 'survive', 'contribute', 'given', 'astronomical', 'IQ', 'even', 'Mr.', 'Wunder', 'III', 'bicep', 'capabilities', 'movie', '8220', 'Sweepstakes', '8221', 'are', 'only', 'exceptions', 'know', 'of.I', 'had', 'very', 'beautiful', 'charismatic', 'handicapped', 'young', 'beautiful', 'friend', 'two', 'classes', 'college', 'felt', 'could', 'truly', 'love', 'whole', 'life', 'very', 'patiently', 'sat', 'down', 'explained', 'how', 'could', 'never', 'be', 'tied', 'what', 'handicapped', 'friends', 'call', '8220', 'ablebodies', '8221', 'called', 'Puppy', 'love', 'purely', 'emotional', 'somewhat', 'selfish', 'explained', 'depth', 'had', 'place', 'physical', 'reality', 'had', 'circle', 'handicapped', 'friends', 'eventually', 'married', 'handicapped', 'man', '8220', 'only', 'had', 'capabilities', 'waists', '8221', 'made', 'use', 'real', 'life', 'experience', 'education', 'life', '8217', 'knowledge/understanding', 'dealing', 'being', 'handicapped', 'help', 'others', 'situation', 'did', 'teaching', 'lecturing', 'special', 'schools', 'thus', 'aiding', 'students', 'parents', 'facing', 'similar', 'problems', 'FORGIVE', 'ME', 'real', 'world', 'unforgiving', 'not', 'as', 'tragic', 'friends', 'military', 'who', 'suffer', 'even', 'more', 'even', '8220', 'wounded', 'warrior', '8221', 'program', 'reasons', 'others', 'have', 'many', 'reservations', 'movie.I', 'WOULD', 'BE', 'INTERESTED', 'IN', 'ANY', '8220', 'PRODUCTIVE', '8221', 'OPINIONS', 'YOU', 'WOULD', 'CARE', 'TO', 'SHARE']",N/A
