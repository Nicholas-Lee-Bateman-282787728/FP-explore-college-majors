Admittedly, I rented it because it has a Vespa in it, but the story of a girl with a terminal illness who wants to hurry up and experience a relationship was interesting on its own. The relationships and story arc are a little choppy. Is the older brother really necessary? Is the mother's art an important aspect to the story?

1232808,A2582KMXLK2P06,B001R88C72,B. E Jackson,"[2, 2]","The Cake Eaters definitely feels like a low budget type drama, but it does an okay job telling a story involving three separate love conflicts among a smalltown family. It's basically like an enhanced episode of the hit TV show Parenthood.The main love story revolves around a 16-year old teenage girl with a terribly fatal muscular disease (this is the most popular of the three), another one involves a middle-aged woman who's an advice-giving hairdresser (hardly receives much attention) and the final one involves a much older couple.Basically, since the storyline mainly focuses on the young girl with the muscle disease, the plot develops around her as she tries desperately to function as a typical normal teenager.The entire storyline takes place in a small town in the middle of nowhere, and perhaps the most unusual thing about the movie is how extremely unsettling and quiet the volume is. In the background you practically don't hear *anything* at all.The acting is decent enough, though I've seen a heck of a lot better in many other films. The biggest problem is the fact the storyline is ridiculously rudimentary, and so it's very easy to grasp the events taking place to the point of being almost mindless.

1232812,A3EXWV8FNSSFL6,B001R88C72,Daniel G. Lebryk,"[0, 0]","This film perplexed me. I really wanted to love this film. On the one hand, it starts out in a creative, indie fashion. The plot is veiled, it's got a quirky editing style, minimalist photography, and sparse sets. Somewhere about half way through the film, it turned into something different, maybe it's the losing her virginity hakneyed story, the simple melodramatic editing and film style, the plot that becomes too obvious. I'm not certain why I didn't like this film more. Mostly, it just didn't ring true enough, didn't set up the conflicts in a unique or believeable fashion, didn't keep a unique style going.The real problem with the film, it's Mary Stuart Masterson's first time directing. She is a wonderful actress, but isn't the best director in the world. Some of the actors also make a lot of sense now - she relied heavily on the Dick Wolf Law And Order staff (she was Dr. Rebecca Hendrix on SVU for several years). My favorite transplant, Jesse L. Martin (Detective Ed Green on Law and Order), wasn't given anywhere near the opportunity to shine in this film.Bruce Dern, recently, such an awful actor that has played nothing but ""Bruce Dern: B actor"" for years, turns in an interesting decent performance as Easy Kimbruagh, the father. The two young stars of this film, Kristen Stewart and Aaron Stanford, were excellent. Kristen maintained her character perfectly throughout the film.The film is about relationships. Georgia and Beagle on their innocent quest to have intercourse. There's a certain level of humanity in this quest, the film says, even people with dibilitating diseases can have normal desires and should be fulfilled. There's a relationship between Georgia's grandmother and Beagle's father. It's one that had gone on for many years, and also say - old people can have a good time together. The most dysfunctional of the couples, Georgia's parents have a relationship with absolutely no intimacy. It's a strange commentary, they seem so normal and average. Even runaway older brother that left a girl after proposing to her, well he gets nothing. Even though he is supposed to be some kind of woman killer.As my description tries to illustrate, it's hard to figure out what Mary Stuart was trying to say. Is the message, only the flawed can have intimate relations or be happy? Or was it just to put some kind of context around this young girl losing her virginity to the school janitor? There was a bit of pause around Georgia's age. She is in high school and is likely skirting that 18 year old area. So is that some other kind of point about illicit love that Mary Stuart is trying to make.Technically the film was spotty. Creative and interesting at the outset. Hackneyed standard melodrama by midpoint. It's a predictible film.The title is still a mystery to me.",3,Confused Me,1242172800,"05 13, 2009",2009,2801,"['film', 'perplexed', 'really', 'wanted', 'love', 'film', 'one', 'hand', 'out', 'creative', 'indie', 'fashion', 'plot', 'veiled', 'got', 'quirky', 'editing', 'style', 'minimalist', 'photography', 'sparse', 'sets', 'Somewhere', 'half', 'way', 'film', 'turned', 'something', 'different', 'maybe', 'losing', 'virginity', 'hakneyed', 'story', 'simple', 'melodramatic', 'editing', 'film', 'style', 'plot', 'too', 'obvious', ""'m"", 'not', 'certain', 'why', 'did', ""n't"", 'like', 'film', 'more', 'Mostly', 'just', 'did', ""n't"", 'ring', 'true', 'enough', 'did', ""n't"", 'set', 'up', 'conflicts', 'unique', 'believeable', 'fashion', 'did', ""n't"", 'keep', 'unique', 'style', 'going.The', 'real', 'problem', 'film', 'Mary', 'Stuart', 'Masterson', 'first', 'time', 'directing', 'wonderful', 'actress', ""n't"", 'best', 'director', 'world', 'actors', 'also', 'make', 'lot', 'sense', 'now', 'relied', 'heavily', 'Dick', 'Wolf', 'Law', 'Order', 'staff', 'was', 'Dr.', 'Rebecca', 'Hendrix', 'SVU', 'several', 'years', 'favorite', 'transplant', 'Jesse', 'L.', 'Martin', 'Detective', 'Ed', 'Green', 'Law', 'Order', 'was', ""n't"", 'given', 'anywhere', 'opportunity', 'shine', 'film.Bruce', 'Dern', 'recently', 'such', 'awful', 'actor', 'played', 'nothing', 'Bruce', 'Dern', 'B', 'actor', 'years', 'interesting', 'decent', 'performance', 'Easy', 'Kimbruagh', 'father', 'two', 'young', 'stars', 'film', 'Kristen', 'Stewart', 'Aaron', 'Stanford', 'were', 'excellent', 'Kristen', 'maintained', 'character', 'perfectly', 'film.The', 'film', 'relationships', 'Georgia', 'Beagle', 'innocent', 'quest', 'have', 'intercourse', 'certain', 'level', 'humanity', 'quest', 'film', 'even', 'people', 'dibilitating', 'diseases', 'can', 'have', 'normal', 'desires', 'should', 'be', 'fulfilled', 'relationship', 'Georgia', 'grandmother', 'Beagle', 'father', 'one', 'had', 'gone', 'many', 'years', 'also', 'say', 'old', 'people', 'can', 'have', 'good', 'time', 'together', 'most', 'dysfunctional', 'couples', 'Georgia', 'parents', 'have', 'relationship', 'absolutely', 'intimacy', 'strange', 'commentary', 'seem', 'so', 'normal', 'average', 'Even', 'runaway', 'older', 'brother', 'left', 'girl', 'proposing', 'well', 'nothing', 'Even', 'supposed', 'be', 'kind', 'woman', 'killer.As', 'description', 'tries', 'illustrate', 'hard', 'figure', 'out', 'what', 'Mary', 'Stuart', 'was', 'trying', 'say', 'message', 'only', 'flawed', 'can', 'have', 'intimate', 'relations', 'be', 'happy', 'was', 'just', 'put', 'kind', 'context', 'young', 'girl', 'losing', 'virginity', 'school', 'janitor', 'was', 'bit', 'pause', 'Georgia', 'age', 'high', 'school', 'likely', 'skirting', '18', 'year', 'old', 'area', 'other', 'kind', 'point', 'illicit', 'love', 'Mary', 'Stuart', 'trying', 'make.Technically', 'film', 'was', 'spotty', 'Creative', 'interesting', 'outset', 'Hackneyed', 'standard', 'melodrama', 'midpoint', 'predictible', 'film.The', 'title', 'still', 'mystery']",The Cake Eaters

Although I was drawn to this gem on the strength of Kristen Stewart's haunting and growing library of solid acting chops to date, enlarged deservedly by ""Twilight,"" her range of work predicts an ascent to the heights of Streep with no reservations. This film is perfectly cast and exquisitely written as it explores the territory of generational love, as well as a Camille-like subplot of Kristen's terminal condition(not the story focus),and still delivers roundhouse performances from all the ensemble cast, particularly Bruce Dern and Elizabeth Ashley, two old studio veterans, that allows them to make up for their lengthy absences from the big screen. I have not seen a film cover such wide ground of emotions in so concise a manner so completely. Every character in this small, independent offering towers in courage before your eyes with fine shadings of flawed humanity and dignity. You will find yourself in this bitter-sweet offering in one of the characters and never forget what was so well unspoken long after each character had their say about the complexities of finding love in time.

Regretfully, I left the store without renting it.  5 years later, I'm perusing the 'free movie' section in Comcast's X-finity channel, and there it is!  By now, I had heard more than enough about Kristen Stewart, the brooding, bratty-looking kid who has taken the world by storm as ""Bella"" and seems to be on every cover of every damn magazine.  Stewart was only 17 when she made this film, and her performance as ""Georgia"", a young girl afflicted with a terrible and fatal neuro-muscular disease, is brilliant.

1232819,A2YM3KILJ1G0YJ,B001R88C72,Jason,"[4, 8]","Georgia (Kristen Stewart) is a 16 year old girl afflicted with Friedreich's Ataxia, a debilitating disease that often attacks first in the motor movements, gait, and speech.  Those hoping this would severely limit Stewart's speaking role might be pleased to learn that her lines are appropriately diminished.  I think of her as a female version of Keanu Reeves, someone who should be seen much more than heard.  Nonetheless, she's disabled but still mentally aware, and she has recently become interested in boys and the idea of sex.For those who have skimmed reviews and read things about a disabled teen having sex with a beagle, have no fears.  This is not that kind of movie.  It's really Beagle (Aaron Stanford), the nickname for a young man named Dwight Kimbrough who works at Georgia's high school cafeteria and has just suffered the loss of his mother.  The two begin an odd romance, seeking to fulfill her intercourse desire and fill his emotional void.  Along the way she gets an atrociously ugly haircut for which her stylist should have been lynched, septuagenarian relatives potentially allow themselves to be accomplices to statutory rape, a prodigal son returns in a subplot more pointless than a white crayon, and the special ed. Juliet gets whisked away on her white knight's horse.  Except by ""whisked away"" I mean ""strapped to the driver by a bungee chord,"" and by horse I mean ""beat up moped.""  Everything eventually, and awkwardly, comes full circle for Beagle's family as well.  Beagle's father proclaims love to the woman with whom he's been infidelitous while his terminally ill wife dwindled away.  The pointless brother finds resolution at his mother's grave.  Beagle celebrates his awkward and probably illegal entry into manhood, dropping Georgia off at school to see her walk away like a cowgirl (because of the affliction, not Beagle's undoubtedly pedestrian efforts).  Which brings me to a point: If the sexes in this movie were reversed, the reviews and position would not be the same.  There would be countless people claiming that a rape had taken place, and that this movie glorifies perversion.There's definite humanity here, but there are too many unbelievable scenes and misplaced emotion for the entirety to ring true.  I admit that the subject matter is difficult, and the disabled shouldn't be treated like second class citizens.  I also note, however, that she couldn't possibly care for an accident, and her pregnancy would certainly add an unnecessary burden to society.  Aside from perhaps Georgia herself, each and every character has a serious flaw that made them unlikeable to me.  Some detestable.  Maybe that's the point.  Maybe the humanity is that Georgia hasn't been tainted like the others, and her wishes are not that misguided or different than the rest of us.  Maybe, in some ways she's better (but probably not at acting).Jason Elin",3,"Difficult subject, conflicting content",1290384000,"11 22, 2010",2010,2890,"['Georgia', 'Kristen', 'Stewart', '16', 'year', 'old', 'girl', 'afflicted', 'Friedreich', 'Ataxia', 'debilitating', 'disease', 'often', 'first', 'motor', 'movements', 'gait', 'speech', 'hoping', 'would', 'severely', 'limit', 'Stewart', 'speaking', 'role', 'might', 'be', 'pleased', 'learn', 'lines', 'are', 'appropriately', 'diminished', 'think', 'female', 'version', 'Keanu', 'Reeves', 'someone', 'who', 'should', 'be', 'seen', 'much', 'more', 'heard', 'Nonetheless', 'disabled', 'still', 'mentally', 'aware', 'recently', 'become', 'interested', 'boys', 'idea', 'sex.For', 'who', 'have', 'skimmed', 'reviews', 'read', 'things', 'disabled', 'teen', 'having', 'sex', 'beagle', 'have', 'fears', 'not', 'kind', 'movie', 'really', 'Beagle', 'Aaron', 'Stanford', 'nickname', 'young', 'man', 'named', 'Dwight', 'Kimbrough', 'who', 'Georgia', 'high', 'school', 'cafeteria', 'just', 'suffered', 'loss', 'mother', 'two', 'begin', 'odd', 'romance', 'seeking', 'fulfill', 'intercourse', 'desire', 'fill', 'emotional', 'void', 'way', 'atrociously', 'ugly', 'haircut', 'stylist', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'lynched', 'septuagenarian', 'relatives', 'potentially', 'allow', 'be', 'accomplices', 'statutory', 'rape', 'prodigal', 'son', 'returns', 'subplot', 'more', 'pointless', 'white', 'crayon', 'special', 'ed', 'Juliet', 'whisked', 'away', 'white', 'knight', 'horse', 'whisked', 'away', 'mean', 'strapped', 'driver', 'bungee', 'chord', 'horse', 'mean', 'beat', 'up', 'moped', 'Everything', 'eventually', 'awkwardly', 'full', 'circle', 'Beagle', 'family', 'as', 'well', 'Beagle', 'father', 'love', 'woman', 'whom', 'been', 'infidelitous', 'terminally', 'ill', 'wife', 'dwindled', 'away', 'pointless', 'brother', 'resolution', 'mother', 'grave', 'Beagle', 'awkward', 'probably', 'illegal', 'entry', 'manhood', 'dropping', 'Georgia', 'off', 'school', 'see', 'walk', 'away', 'cowgirl', 'affliction', 'not', 'Beagle', 'undoubtedly', 'pedestrian', 'efforts', 'Which', 'point', 'sexes', 'movie', 'were', 'reversed', 'reviews', 'position', 'would', 'not', 'be', 'same', 'would', 'be', 'countless', 'people', 'claiming', 'rape', 'had', 'taken', 'place', 'movie', 'definite', 'humanity', 'here', 'are', 'too', 'many', 'unbelievable', 'scenes', 'misplaced', 'emotion', 'entirety', 'ring', 'true', 'admit', 'subject', 'matter', 'difficult', 'disabled', 'should', ""n't"", 'be', 'treated', 'second', 'class', 'citizens', 'also', 'note', 'however', 'could', ""n't"", 'possibly', 'care', 'accident', 'pregnancy', 'would', 'certainly', 'add', 'unnecessary', 'burden', 'society', 'Aside', 'perhaps', 'Georgia', 'character', 'serious', 'flaw', 'made', 'unlikeable', 'detestable', 'Maybe', 'point', 'Maybe', 'humanity', 'Georgia', ""n't"", 'been', 'tainted', 'others', 'wishes', 'are', 'not', 'misguided', 'different', 'rest', 'Maybe', 'ways', 'better', 'probably', 'not', 'acting', '.Jason', 'Elin']",The Cake Eaters

Really, really bad.I suppose it is trying to be deep and meaningful, but it is just painfully stilted and artificial: from beginning to end, not one word any character speaks sounds like a real human being talking.

Leo) to highlight an unknown film. To be clear, Melissa has two minutes of non-dialogue screen time in a flashback montage and Kirsten has intermittent segments in the first 35 minutes of this 80 minute film. Bruce Dern and others have equivalent lines in this film throughout so I would consider this an ensemble piece, especially once the ending plays out.Several stories parlay into this segment of NorEast lifestyles entailing two families' rural existence complicated by past and present loves tying said families together. The performances are nuanced and let loose an idea of what small-town romances can be like over two related generations. In plot summary, do not expect much in opening and closing; the opening discussion is about cereal and the closing discusses what to make for dinner. The middle tried to fit in three love stories with the remaining 60 minutes. The writing is inconsistent throughout, bolstered several times by moments of people needing to react differently than they should have.The DVD quality is adequate, the supplements list a commentary, exclusive behind-the-scenes, deleted scenes and a 5.1 sound. To be honest - the supplements are completely forgettable and the film's 5.1 only gets used a handful of times. The cast interviews total three minutes of how phenomenal Kristen Stewart is (not kidding), the ""exclusives"" are an additional three minutes of film making and the deleted scenes were irrelevant.The fan base of this film is fanatical, so expect lots of slams unless one reviews this film as the best thing since Don't Come Knocking on the minimalist front. But to be real, this is the story about a neurological/muscular disorder challenged teen losing her virginity, nothing more or less. Solid performances and decent music lend this a few stars above normal, that and a plethora of new Twilight fans giving this a much higher rating then other films similar in nature.
