And, the story was easy to follow with a happy ending.  I loved the actors - perfect for their parts.  It was also &#34;different&#34; that the film's writer was one of the main characters in the film.",5,filmed in Hawaii,1386892800,"12 13, 2013",2013,349,"['gave', '5', 'stars', 'following', 'First', 'was', 'filmed', 'Hawaii', 'was', 'great', 'point', 'out', 'recognize', 'different', 'locations', 'story', 'was', 'easy', 'follow', 'happy', 'ending', 'loved', 'actors', 'perfect', 'parts', 'was', 'also', '34', 'different', '34', 'film', 'writer', 'was', 'one', 'main', 'characters', 'film']",N/A

The 4 Wedding Planners are Miriam, Lily, Twinny and Hoku a single mom and her three girlsMy favorite part is the beginning where we see the story during the credits of how this eclectic family came to be showing how Miriam ended up with 3 daughters and 3 different fathers in a serious of funny little cartoon animations.Lily is very independent and is pretty much the anti ""marriage"" daughter so when her boyfriend proposes she runs. She takes a plane and comes home to her wedding planning family after many years. They are not planning her wedding, they literally plan weddings for others.Lily and her sisters are all very different.  Twinny is pregnant ""often"" and the baby, Hoku just wants to be in love and is with Lily's former boyfriend.The movie is fun, light and sweet. I love Illeana Doughlas as Miriam the mom who is running a wedding business with all her nervous faults and OCD issues.Hawaii is beautiful, the actresses are beautiful the storyline is fun!",3,Fun Premise.
