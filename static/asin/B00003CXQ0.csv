532272,ABLWGDPUOSEXR,B00003CXQ0,Bradford Wilson,"[1, 1]","One of the reviewers for this movie said it had 'something for everyone.'  Well, I'm a big fan of basically all types of movies, and to be honest, I was a little bored with this one.  I've always loved the cartoon, but maybe that's because it's only a half hour.  An hour and a half of Rugrats is just a little too much for me.The film centers around the lives of several little children, but mainly one boy, Chucky, who's mom has died and who's Dad is now in the market for a new mom for him.  Dad's job takes him and the kids over seas to Paris where he must fix a broken-down amusement park ride.  While he's there, he meets a few perspective takers.It's interesting how the story is told from the children's' points of view.  Something that might seem gross or inappropriate to an adult is a paradigm of interest to the tots.  The grownups are intelligent and can think for themselves.  Sometimes in movies geared toward children, the adults are merely objects to help move the story along, and not necessarily an important part of the central focus of the movie.  That is not the case here.  The music from the movie is generally good (with the exception of the atrocious &quot;Who Let the Dogs Out&quot;) especially a song entitled &quot;I Want a Mom That Will Last Forever,&quot; a touching ballad sung by Cyndi Lauper.The film is charming and touching in parts but still a bit juvenile for my tastes.

532274,A38JWSLCF9AYOZ,B00003CXQ0,Fluffy's Owner,"[1, 2]","Of course, I think this movie is super! The reason I rated it 5 stars is because of the plot. Actually, there were a few plots, like the wedding, giant robots, broken hearts, and lying. That is everything I love. Well, okay, maybe the fact that it's not scary is distressing, because I love horror. But, all in all, it was a great film. I watch it a lot with my mom. The villain, Cocoa, was super. Her plan was to become the president of the whole theme park and, believe me, that was a very important job. The whole reason they had to go to Paris, France was because the gigantic robot, Reptar, had his head blown up, which I think was hilarious. It made a huge mess, and then they had to go all the way to Paris which, believe me, is a long way. But, it really turned into an adventure and here are some things that happened: a crazy woman tried to trick Chuckie's dad into marrying her, and a dog running away, then a wedding, and a gigantic robo-snail which, believe me, is exciting and entertaining. I would have given it about 4 stars, but the plot just had to make one more star. My favorite part was when the whole plot began, but Chuckie knew that he must stop all these weird things from really happening, or his life would be ruined. If you ask me, there was a lot they had to worry about. I mean, they still did fix Reptar, which was important. There are even cool controls that make Reptar move.

532286,A29BQ6B90Y1R5F,B00003CXQ0,S. Rhodes,"[4, 5]","There are two things that keep this film from being as good as the first one.  Those things are Kimi (horrible character) and elements gone too far out of reach of the ordinary human imagination.Rugrats fans may like this, but to me this movie only further propelled the downfall of the TV series I grew up watching.  It's no longer one of the favorite shows of my youth, and I can't help but say one of the reasons for it is this movie.Stu has made a new invention, a Reptar robot that can be used for a play being performed in Paris, France.  He signs the deal and the Rugrats are off to Paris!  And this time Chuckie is getting a mommy.It's a fun adventure, but by all means it isn't a good one.  A few things about it are just too farfetched.  For example, the parents are downright stupid.  How do you NOT know your kids are missing?  And why would you leave a bunch of toddlers in a hotel room without supervision? Honestly.Another aspect that sends it on a downhill is the simple fact that some parts just don't feel believable.  The babies end up climbing into Stu's invention and going all over Paris with it.  In this 100 foot Reptar they manage to smash through most of Paris, save Angelica when she is propelled up the Eifle Tower and falls from it.  To me this is an overstretched imagination.  Even babies controlling a giant robot is too far outside the box.And then there's Kimi.  The new character on the block.  At least unlike Dil she does something, but Kimi has things that annoy me so much more than Dil.  Kimi is an asian baby (with cowboy boots) who is always ready for an adventure.  I don't mind that at all, and I don't even mind that Tommy seems to have a crush on her throughout the film.  What I do mind though, is how perfect she is as a child.  Even Tommy makes mistakes, but Kimi seems to be the know-it-all baby.  As a character she's overall flawed by not having any flaws!  As the character Otacon said in the video game Metal Gear Solid; ""People just aren't complete without some type of character flaw..."" and you know what? He's right!I'm not trying to be picky, but overall I'd say that the main reason the film didn't work was because of Kimi.  I was a big Rugrats fan in the early 90's and even after Dil came a long I found the strength to keep watching the already flawed television show.  But after Kimi came, that was it; no more Rugrats for me!A great adventure?  Sure it is.  It's good if your younger than ten.  Even for the older audiences that like the Rugrats this film just can't measure up to what it's worth.  Kimi is a horrible character and the overstretch of imagination with some of the aspects of the film are really stupid.Good movie?  I would like to think not.

532289,ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T,B00003CXQ0,Tsuyoshi,"[1, 2]","Now I remember watching the first ""Rugrats"" movie in almost empty theater, which went totally ignored in Japan, where Nickleodeon's original famous, long-cherished TV series is virtually unknown among Japanese anime productons.  And this  second theatrical offering, after that result, went as a consequence almost unnoticed, given only a very limited theatrical release (and Japanese-dubbed version only).  So, I bought a copy at Amazon, just to listen to the original cast's voice.  Yes, no one can reproduce the voice of wickedly funny Angelica.The second movie ""Rugrats in Paris"" turned out better than I expected, and probably the first thetrical one.  Adults, let me give you good news, there are less toilet humors that is one of the characteristics of the series.  Well, still there is, but thanks to the producers' wise decision, the focus is given to Chuckie, (comparatively) elder member of the baby gang that go  to Paris with a reason so far-fetched that you might as well forget at all.  Anyway, the point is, the kids in dipers go to an amusement park in Paris, managed single-handedly by a mean, greedy woman Coco (imagine Cruela of ""101"" with-French accent, voiced by Susan Sarandon)  Apparently in the name of love for kids (but with her own hidden agenda), she swears that she is going to marry Chuckie's dad, but before that, her amusement park, and inevitably the city of Paris also has to suffer the greatest wreck since the time of ""Armaggedon.""The story is nothing but an excuse for those kids' wracky gags, and sometimes the film, even for its short running time, looks as if padded out.  Still, the film goes smoothly (more smoothly than the previous film) and by giving (again comparatively) elder characters more time for spotlight, the film avoids being filled with gross-out laughs though, obviously for younger audience, they are still retained.  One of my favorite moments of the film is when deliciously mean child-devil Angelica reflects: ""Sometime I can't help myself.""  Yeah, that's why you are so lovely.The only complaint from Japanese audience is that the film, intentionally or not, seems as if confusing Japan and China.  Though names like Tanaka or Yamaguchi are obviously Japanese ones (and Mako, born in Kobe provides for the former), their costumes and manners rather belong to Chinese tradition -- for instance, dragons or gongs -- and this kind of confusion might explain the lukewarm reception on the side of Japanese distributors.  As a matter of fact, the people in both countries are getting too much weary of this kind of mistakes.These things aside, the film lives up to our standard of animated film today, and if nothing special, ""Rugrats in Paris"" gives you an enjoyable trip to fantasy world with those noisy but lovely child gang from Nickelodeon.",4,"Oh Angelica, What Have You Done ...

Though the movie doesn't delve much into the imaginative world of the kids, it is full of imagination and more inspiration than the first picture. I especially liked the GODFATHER and GODZILLA parodies.
