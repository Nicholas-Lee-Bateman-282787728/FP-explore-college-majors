The story is OK, but there is not a lot of comedy in this 'sex-comedy' ( there's not a lot of sex either ), apart from the scenes with Stephen Fry as a therapist. Binder seems to be trying to emulate Woody Allen's style and character in this movie. The remaining characters do their bit, but there is not a lot to work with in a story about two couples who switch partners.",2,foul play,1302912000,"04 16, 2011",2011,497,"['not', 'happy', 'one-', 'have', 'watched', 'twice', 'two', 'days', 'try', 'find', 'something', 'more', 'like', 'it-', 'success', 'story', 'OK', 'not', 'lot', 'comedy', ""'sex-comedy"", 'not', 'lot', 'sex', 'apart', 'scenes', 'Stephen', 'Fry', 'therapist', 'Binder', 'be', 'trying', 'emulate', 'Woody', 'Allen', 'style', 'character', 'movie', 'remaining', 'characters', 'do', 'bit', 'not', 'lot', 'work', 'story', 'two', 'couples', 'who', 'switch', 'partners']",N/A

This is a three time a week movie - it makes me laugh so much.When Christopher Lawford showed up on screen- I kept thinking who is that? Who does he look like?  Well sad to say I am old enough to remember his father, Peter Lawford, but had never seen the son in a movie before.  He looks so much like his father.Colin Firth makes this movie!

It begins with Carly and Allen, who are married on a picnic with Ben and Fiona, who Carly invited because she thought they would be good for each other.  Allen(Firth) character is not a very like-able one in the beginning, how he treats Carly his wife, and his subordinates etc.  But his character begins to grow and well I will not spoil the ending. NOTE: I watched this a few times and it does grow on one, seeing foreshadowing's missed the first time around.Cast:  Mike Binder plays Ben Greene; Colin Firth plays Allen Portland; Mariel Hemingway plays Carly Matthews Portland; Ir&egrave;ne Jacob plays Fiona Delgrazia;Stephen Fry plays Nigel Steele (Therapist); Jack Dee plays Glen; Stephen Marcus plays Davey; Christopher Lawford plays Davis;Michael Meader plays Sitcom Husband; David Reid plays Assistant Director; Fabien Riggall plays Sitcom Son; Gordon Sterne plays Color of My Life Actor;Kerry Appleyard plays Ben's Assistant; Tony Allen plays Rabbi; Michael Deaton plays Minister; Sally Thompson plays Woman in Church;Charlie Gardner plays Rock Band in Park 'Carbon'; Jol Scott plays Rock Band in Park 'Carbon'; Diego Mancini plays Rock Band in Park 'Carbon';Rod K.
