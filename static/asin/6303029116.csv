351642,A3N94LNED0IF0R,6303029116,Charles S. Tashiro,"[16, 18]","EDVARD MUNCH is an ambitious, often heavy-going effort to transcend traditional artist biographies with a cinematic equivalent of the artist's paintings. It fails, but on the way succeeds in so many other ways that the failure almost doesn't matter.In interviews, director Peter Watkins has been explicit about his total identification with Munch, how in the obsessive effort to portray the artist's life on screen, he effectively was revealing his own neuroses and experiences. People might be put off by the results. Watkins gives the film the  look of a fictional biography. He then films events as if he were a documentary filmmaker present at the time. So there is a lot of loose, hand-held camera; there are &quot;interviews&quot; with actors (many of whom improvised or wrote their responses) speaking in character; and Watkins himself frequently intrudes with narration that helps us understand both Munch's significance in the history of art and how his times influenced his work. The voice-over also tells us what Munch feels and experiences, much as the narrator of a novel pretends to know what his protagonist is thinking at any given moment.It is this effort to reveal the relationship between the artist's turmoil and his work that motivates the kaleidoscopic editing style, jumping from one event in the &quot;present,&quot; to one in the past, sideways to another, back to something else we've already seen, then out again. Sometimes these edits are built on visual associations; often Watkins relies on the soundtrack to glue them together. It is here that the film's ambitions start to unravel. Other filmmakers who have used such technique (Eisenstein, Resnais, Godard and Roeg, for example) let their cuts ebb and flow over time. Watkins simply cuts, constantly, repeatedly, without much variation in speed or rhythm. Either through a lack of confidence or talent, the images fail to compel on their own, to persuade that there is any relationship between shots not forced by the editor's heavy hand. After nearly three hours, the barrage is exhausting.But also exhaustive. Most artist biographies on film are an embarrassment. EDVARD MUNCH is one of the very few to give us a sense of both the man and his work. You do not have to be particularly interested in Munch to find the film's experiments fascinating, even in their failure. Just be prepared to get up to stretch every once in a while.",4,Things that Obsess,972518400,"10 26, 2000",2000,2416,"['EDVARD', 'MUNCH', 'ambitious', 'often', 'heavy-going', 'effort', 'transcend', 'traditional', 'artist', 'biographies', 'cinematic', 'equivalent', 'artist', 'paintings', 'way', 'so', 'many', 'other', 'ways', 'failure', 'almost', ""n't"", 'matter.In', 'interviews', 'director', 'Peter', 'Watkins', 'been', 'explicit', 'total', 'identification', 'Munch', 'how', 'obsessive', 'effort', 'portray', 'artist', 'life', 'screen', 'effectively', 'was', 'revealing', 'own', 'neuroses', 'experiences', 'People', 'might', 'be', 'put', 'off', 'results', 'film', 'look', 'fictional', 'biography', 'then', 'events', 'were', 'documentary', 'filmmaker', 'present', 'time', 'So', 'lot', 'loose', 'hand-held', 'camera', 'are', 'quot', 'interviews', 'quot', 'actors', 'many', 'whom', 'improvised', 'wrote', 'responses', 'speaking', 'character', 'frequently', 'narration', 'understand', 'Munch', 'significance', 'history', 'art', 'how', 'times', 'influenced', 'work', 'voice-over', 'also', 'what', 'Munch', 'feels', 'experiences', 'much', 'narrator', 'novel', 'pretends', 'know', 'what', 'protagonist', 'thinking', 'given', 'moment.It', 'effort', 'reveal', 'relationship', 'artist', 'turmoil', 'work', 'kaleidoscopic', 'editing', 'style', 'jumping', 'one', 'event', 'quot', 'present', 'quot', 'one', 'past', 'back', 'something', 'else', ""'ve"", 'already', 'seen', 'then', 'out', 'again', 'Sometimes', 'edits', 'are', 'built', 'visual', 'associations', 'often', 'relies', 'soundtrack', 'glue', 'together', 'here', 'film', 'ambitions', 'start', 'unravel', 'Other', 'filmmakers', 'who', 'have', 'used', 'such', 'technique', 'Eisenstein', 'Resnais', 'Godard', 'Roeg', 'example', 'let', 'cuts', 'ebb', 'flow', 'time', 'Watkins', 'simply', 'cuts', 'constantly', 'repeatedly', 'much', 'variation', 'speed', 'rhythm', 'lack', 'confidence', 'talent', 'images', 'fail', 'compel', 'own', 'persuade', 'relationship', 'shots', 'not', 'forced', 'editor', 'heavy', 'hand', 'nearly', 'three', 'hours', 'barrage', 'exhausting.But', 'also', 'exhaustive', 'Most', 'artist', 'biographies', 'film', 'are', 'embarrassment', 'EDVARD', 'MUNCH', 'one', 'very', 'few', 'give', 'sense', 'man', 'work', 'do', 'not', 'have', 'be', 'particularly', 'interested', 'Munch', 'find', 'film', 'experiments', 'fascinating', 'even', 'failure', 'Just', 'be', 'prepared', 'get', 'up', 'stretch', 'once', 'while']",N/A

Newlove,"[22, 24]","I've seen this twice, the first time in its theatrical showing, maybe twenty years ago, then more recently on video, which as I recall was also in widescreen. So that's six hours with Watkins' demandingly beautiful film. For awhile I later confused Watkins with David Watkins, the fabulous photographer of OUT OF AFRICA, and for all I know these two filmmakers are related. EDVARD MUNCH is a masterpiece of tonalities. This is a movie about light. You are in a Munch work just by the demanding beauty of the light and of Watkins' inspired painterliness with rich Munch-like blues. The smokey blue scenes in Bohemian bars have the same dense sense of lost time recaptured as do scenes of Munch painting in his attics and scoring his pictures violently as the sharp end of his brush digs into fresh paint and almost rips his canvas. When you think of John Huston's MOULIN ROUGE, a dull film with some good moments, particularly when Lautrec's &quot;hand&quot; draws figures on a restaurant table, we remember mostly idle moments in Lautrec's lovelife (and of course the Can-Can dancers). From EDVARD MUNCH we recall far more extraordinary feelings of being lifted out of ourselves and thrust back into the very rooms Munch lived in and the into the Scandanavian light he worked in and into the tortured set of his mind as he shrank figures into hard, strong, symbolic forms. I await the day this film appears digitally (it was never a laser disc, sad to say, or I'd have it already). Since it may not be issued on DVD for eight or ten years, seek the video cassette version. You will watch it more than once. Maybe not in the same year but it will be a respected treasure that you will thank yourself for having sought out. Or rent it first. Maybe you don't really have to own it if it will be on hand for renting. Still, not all that many stores will have it ready to rent, now that it's out of print.

351645,A3KKOJ6T4DCBDT,6303029116,"technoguy ""jack""","[0, 1]","The film is both historic and subjective in it's treatment by the film maker Peter Watkins.He breaks down the old rigid hierarchies of film-making used in tv, biography, documentary,also in films depicting the lives and works of major artists. This film is also like a mirror he holds up to his own life and struggles, and rejection by his own society. Truly remarkable in that it is mounted like a documentary(with recreations of course)of the creative process,how Munch's personal life affected his art and how the changes in society also impinge.We get the influence of his personal memories in flash back.We get his family or friends staring out at us or answering questions about their attitudes to Munch or their views on sexuality.He utilises a dialectical process between sound layers and montages of image.We see his relationships with women developing-anguish,reticence,anger,longing and how they are depicted in his art.The two major paintings that are shown are The Sick Child(showing him attacking and slashing at the canvas) and The Scream with a few Vampires and The Dance of Life in between.Also the various techniques, like etching and wood-cutting that he translates his paintings into.We see the various receptions of his work in Scandinavia and Munch was in reaction to the bourgeois,rigid, hypocritical morality of Christiana as was Knut Hamsun,giving himself over to the subjectivism,moods, feelings, images of one's inner self,in the absence(qua Neitschze) of God.Through art there was a belief in cultural and spiritual renewal.The distinction between the urban and nature have broken down.Anguish,anxiety is projected into nature or nature's dread is being blocked out.Munch experienced extreme poverty and ridicule and utilised cheap board to paint on,even letting nature take it's course(and chance) by leaving works hanging on a tree.I suspect the spirit of Munch even had a hand in the many robberies of the work, decrying the restorers attempts to clean it up!He saw the skull beneath the skin like Webster.Munch seems to have developed a dread of sexuality,thinking women would absorb all his semen-fuelled creativity.Hence his darker,later depictions as opposed to his earlierdepictions of women in the sick room or in nature.Munch in the present was affected badly by his earlier loss of mother and sister to T.B. and his father's fanatical fundamentalism.Social and political events all influenced his work.His fame took off in Germany and Europe.His circle of friends in the Bohemians like Strindberg all flirted withinsanity and trauma in their lives and works.In The Scream,the artistis not concerned with reality as it appears but with its inner nature and with the emotions aroused by the subject. To achieve this,the subject is exaggerated,distorted or altered to stress the emotional experience in its most intense and concentrated form.Also the use ofsolid blocks of powerful colour.We get an attack of existential angst in Northern Europe with Expressionism as its main development. You feel what the artist feels.The most remarkable facts are Watkins' use of non-actors and how he came to make this film of 3.5 hrs. running time in Norway, using only local technicians and people who only spoke Norwegian.This is a monumental piece of artistry and deserves to be better known and distributed.This is sensitive craftmanship.",5,Master craftsmen of film and paint,1273363200,"05 9, 2010",2010,3367,"['film', 'historic', 'subjective', 'treatment', 'film', 'maker', 'Peter', 'Watkins.He', 'down', 'old', 'rigid', 'hierarchies', 'film-making', 'used', 'tv', 'biography', 'documentary', 'also', 'films', 'depicting', 'lives', 'works', 'major', 'artists', 'film', 'also', 'mirror', 'up', 'own', 'life', 'struggles', 'rejection', 'own', 'society', 'Truly', 'remarkable', 'mounted', 'documentary', 'recreations', 'course', 'creative', 'process', 'how', 'Munch', 'personal', 'life', 'affected', 'art', 'how', 'changes', 'society', 'also', 'get', 'influence', 'personal', 'memories', 'flash', 'back.We', 'get', 'family', 'friends', 'staring', 'out', 'answering', 'questions', 'attitudes', 'Munch', 'views', 'sexuality.He', 'dialectical', 'process', 'sound', 'layers', 'montages', 'image.We', 'see', 'relationships', 'women', 'developing-anguish', 'reticence', 'anger', 'longing', 'how', 'are', 'depicted', 'art.The', 'two', 'major', 'paintings', 'are', 'shown', 'are', 'Sick', 'Child', 'showing', 'attacking', 'slashing', 'canvas', 'Scream', 'few', 'Vampires', 'Dance', 'Life', 'between.Also', 'various', 'techniques', 'etching', 'wood-cutting', 'paintings', 'into.We', 'see', 'various', 'receptions', 'work', 'Scandinavia', 'Munch', 'was', 'reaction', 'bourgeois', 'rigid', 'hypocritical', 'morality', 'Christiana', 'was', 'Knut', 'Hamsun', 'giving', 'subjectivism', 'moods', 'feelings', 'images', 'one', 'inner', 'self', 'absence', 'qua', 'Neitschze', 'God.Through', 'art', 'was', 'belief', 'cultural', 'spiritual', 'renewal.The', 'distinction', 'urban', 'nature', 'have', 'broken', 'down.Anguish', 'anxiety', 'projected', 'nature', 'nature', 'dread', 'being', 'blocked', 'out.Munch', 'experienced', 'extreme', 'poverty', 'ridicule', 'utilised', 'cheap', 'board', 'paint', 'even', 'letting', 'nature', 'take', 'course', 'chance', 'leaving', 'works', 'hanging', 'tree.I', 'suspect', 'spirit', 'Munch', 'even', 'had', 'hand', 'many', 'robberies', 'work', 'decrying', 'restorers', 'attempts', 'clean', 'up', 'saw', 'skull', 'beneath', 'skin', 'Webster.Munch', 'have', 'developed', 'dread', 'sexuality', 'thinking', 'women', 'would', 'absorb', 'semen-fuelled', 'creativity.Hence', 'darker', 'later', 'depictions', 'opposed', 'earlierdepictions', 'women', 'sick', 'room', 'nature.Munch', 'present', 'was', 'affected', 'badly', 'earlier', 'loss', 'mother', 'sister', 'T.B', 'father', 'fanatical', 'fundamentalism.Social', 'political', 'events', 'influenced', 'work.His', 'fame', 'took', 'off', 'Germany', 'Europe.His', 'circle', 'friends', 'Bohemians', 'Strindberg', 'all', 'flirted', 'withinsanity', 'trauma', 'lives', 'works.In', 'Scream', 'artistis', 'not', 'concerned', 'reality', 'inner', 'nature', 'emotions', 'aroused', 'subject', 'achieve', 'subject', 'exaggerated', 'distorted', 'altered', 'stress', 'emotional', 'experience', 'most', 'intense', 'concentrated', 'form.Also', 'use', 'ofsolid', 'blocks', 'powerful', 'colour.We', 'get', 'attack', 'existential', 'angst', 'Northern', 'Europe', 'Expressionism', 'main', 'development', 'feel', 'what', 'artist', 'feels.The', 'most', 'remarkable', 'facts', 'are', 'Watkins', 'use', 'non-actors', 'how', 'came', 'make', 'film', '3.5', 'hrs', 'running', 'time', 'Norway', 'using', 'only', 'local', 'technicians', 'people', 'who', 'only', 'spoke', 'Norwegian.This', 'monumental', 'piece', 'artistry', 'be', 'better', 'known', 'distributed.This', 'sensitive', 'craftmanship']",N/A
351646,A2YDVQRBG8T3D7,6303029116,"Theresa Williams ""Zen""","[2, 4]","Peter Watkins reveals the inner life of Edvard Munch in much the same way as Paul Cox reveals Vincent Van Gogh's in VINCENT.Watkins' approach, though, is more sylistic.  The flashbacks and the repetition, which may seem obnoxious at first, do have a purpose and have a cumulative effect.  Eventually, one comes to understand in a profound way how Munch's family and romantic associations affected his art.  One of the most profound revelations I had while watching the film had to do with Munch's famous painting, ""The Vampire.""  Watkins suggests what may have influenced it; however Watkins allows the viewer to make the connection.  Indeed, Watkins uses the strategy several times.  My point is that one begins to understand the psychological underpinnings of Munch's art.  Watkins doesn't rely on explaining concepts, techniques, or artistic movements the way many art historians and critics do.  The result of Watkins' approach is startling and original.In making VINCENT, Cox used Van Gogh's letters.  I expected Watkins would draw heavily from Munch's journal, but he didn't.  That is to say, Watkins didn't have a narrator read from the journal as a means of pushing forward or explaining the film.  However, Watkins does reference the journal several times.If you're looking for a straightforward documentary on Munch, this film may disappoint you.  It's long and may seem fragmented at first.  Only after sitting with the film a while does one begin to live inside it.  In a sense, Watkins attempts to recreate Munch's inner life on screen, rather than simply telling the viewer about it.Watkins' film is a work of art in itself, and, as such, defies conventions and expectations.  It is, in the final analysis, unforgettable.",5,A Master Painter Revealed,1158451200,"09 17, 2006",2006,1735,"['Peter', 'Watkins', 'inner', 'life', 'Edvard', 'Munch', 'much', 'same', 'way', 'Paul', 'Cox', 'Vincent', 'Van', 'Gogh', 'VINCENT.Watkins', 'approach', 'more', 'sylistic', 'flashbacks', 'repetition', 'may', 'seem', 'obnoxious', 'first', 'do', 'have', 'purpose', 'have', 'cumulative', 'effect', 'Eventually', 'one', 'understand', 'profound', 'way', 'how', 'Munch', 'family', 'romantic', 'associations', 'affected', 'art', 'One', 'most', 'profound', 'revelations', 'had', 'watching', 'film', 'had', 'do', 'Munch', 'famous', 'painting', 'Vampire', 'what', 'may', 'have', 'influenced', 'however', 'viewer', 'make', 'connection', 'Indeed', 'strategy', 'several', 'times', 'point', 'one', 'understand', 'psychological', 'underpinnings', 'Munch', 'art', 'Watkins', ""n't"", 'rely', 'explaining', 'concepts', 'techniques', 'artistic', 'movements', 'way', 'many', 'art', 'historians', 'critics', 'do', 'result', 'Watkins', 'approach', 'startling', 'original.In', 'making', 'VINCENT', 'Cox', 'used', 'Van', 'Gogh', 'letters', 'expected', 'Watkins', 'would', 'draw', 'heavily', 'Munch', 'journal', 'did', ""n't"", 'say', 'Watkins', 'did', ""n't"", 'have', 'narrator', 'read', 'journal', 'means', 'pushing', 'forward', 'explaining', 'film', 'However', 'Watkins', 'reference', 'journal', 'several', 'times.If', ""'re"", 'looking', 'straightforward', 'documentary', 'Munch', 'film', 'may', 'disappoint', 'long', 'may', 'seem', 'fragmented', 'first', 'Only', 'sitting', 'film', 'while', 'one', 'begin', 'live', 'sense', 'attempts', 'recreate', 'Munch', 'inner', 'life', 'screen', 'rather', 'simply', 'telling', 'viewer', 'it.Watkins', 'film', 'work', 'art', 'such', 'defies', 'conventions', 'expectations', 'final', 'analysis', 'unforgettable']",N/A
351647,A2AJMMNO4S3IK,6303029116,"Tintin ""tintin75""","[18, 45]","Munch has long been one of my favorite painters, if not my favorite, since I was seventeen years old.  I love films (Angelopoulos, Tarkovsky, Fellini, Antonioni, Bergman, you name it.). Therefore, it was not a hard decision for me to forgo a particularly beautiful afternoon in the outdoors for being locked up for three hours in the AC atmosphere of a movie theater. What a mistake, and what a disappointment! Where was the editor (sorry, it was Watkins) for this film? I am amazed that director/editor Peter Watkins should so obviously confuse the television medium for cinema. The film is about one hour too long. It is repetitive, grossly uneven in its presentation of the painter's life (half-life, would be a more appropriate term). It seems that Watkins went on and on, repeating himself, and suddenly, looking at his watch, realized he had to rush through the remainder of Munch's life to finish the film.  He rushed and still did not make it past 1909.  Why ignore Munch, the man and his work, after 1909?  But I guess this is the director's prerogative, to show what he wants of Munch's life.In general, the cinematography is good, with delicate colors.  The representation of the period was well researched and comes across as authentic.  The hand-held camera works well most of the time, with beautiful close-ups.  In some scenes, such as the socio-political discussions in the cafes, its unsteadiness underlines the chaos of the expounded philosophy.  There are even moments of greatness, such as when Munch is painting ""Death in the Sickroom.""  Unfortunately, more often than not, the camera is shaky for no apparent reason.  But there are far too many cuts, so many it makes one dizzy at times just watching, and they interfere with the narrative thread of the story.  Worse, the contrivance of the cuts is astonishingly predictable -- after a while, I knew that the instant any character's eyes looked directly into the camera, the scene was going to quickly cut to something else.  Geir Westby's performance, whose likeness to Munch is remarkable, is not convincing: one does not get any insight regarding Munch's internal demons, or any real sense of the artist's passion, jealousy, and repression.  The dreadful environment, familial, social and political, seems practically divorced from Munch's life, as the artist appears to stand apart from it all, an outside observer.  His very critical relationship with his father is hardly touched upon, except for a (too often) repeated short scene at the dining table, when Munch was still young.  Munch's complex and ambiguous feelings about women in general, which shaped so much of his work, are not even touched upon, except for his particular relationship with Mrs. Heiberg (Gro Fraas).  Waltkins' decision to present Munch's biography more like a docu-drama could have been rewarding, except for the fact that he was not able to integrate the historical document with the subject matter.It all boils down to the editing, which is just AWFUL.  Believe me, I say this not because the film is three-hours long (Angelopoulos' and Tarkovsky's films do not exactly produce short subjects), but because when a director has nothing new to say, and keeps repeating himself, it quickly becomes tedious and boring.  Most likely, the original television production was shown in three one-hour installments.  Therefore, many of the numerous flashbacks were justified, not only to somehow refresh the memories of the viewers who might have seen one or two previous episodes in the preceding weeks, but also to ""bring aboard"" new viewers.  But in the continuum of the film, these same flashbacks become useless, even counter-productive, unnecessarily weighing down the viewer with back-story.Please note that I did not follow many of my fellow spectators who left the theatre early.
