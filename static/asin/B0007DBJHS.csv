The accounts of his generosity and compassion for his peers and backup singers is a story that most fans were never told while Elvis was alive. His love of Gospel Music and dedication to promote that music is vividly portrayed by the singers who performed with him at the height of his legendary career . As fellow Christian I was especially encouraged that Elvis tried to use his voice for the greater glory of God from whom he received his awesome talent.,5,Elvis Presley: He Touched Me,1357430400,"01 6, 2013",2013,557,"['DVD', 'set', 'insider', 'view', 'great', 'singer', 'life', 'what', 'life', 'was', 'off', 'stage', 'accounts', 'generosity', 'compassion', 'peers', 'backup', 'singers', 'story', 'most', 'fans', 'were', 'never', 'told', 'Elvis', 'was', 'alive', 'love', 'Gospel', 'Music', 'dedication', 'promote', 'music', 'vividly', 'portrayed', 'singers', 'who', 'performed', 'height', 'legendary', 'career', 'fellow', 'Christian', 'was', 'especially', 'encouraged', 'Elvis', 'tried', 'use', 'voice', 'greater', 'glory', 'God', 'whom', 'received', 'awesome', 'talent']",N/A

I made this decision because 1) I have all of the Elvis gospel albums and 2) I view this as a documentary, where they discuss Elvis in relation to his gospel roots and his love of the music. Looked at in this way, I was delighted and impressed with the depth of personal stories and interviews provided. I especially loved hearing how Elvis seemed to read the thoughts and focused so much on the healing intention of his musicians. What a deep connection he had to God and to his fellow man. To hear others who were there with him, sharing their intimate stories in this was was worth the price tenfold. If you are seeking the full song versions, I recommend his award winning gospel CD's.
