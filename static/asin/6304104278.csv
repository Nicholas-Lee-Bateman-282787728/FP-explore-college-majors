401132,A2E1EFNIZL2FVA,6304104278,&#9899;   RIZZO   &#9899;,"[2, 2]","The Apu Trilogy was recently named in Time magazine's 100 greatest films.  Satyajit Ray, 1921-1992, one of the world's finest directors was born into a family of elite that includes musicians, physicians, scientist, author, illustrator, photographer, singer, etc.  Made in the late 50's, the trilogy is set in the 20's.  Ray's career lists an impressive number of movies, books, documentaries, etc.  Passionate for film at a very young age he was influenced by the greatest.His movies capture humanistic elements - relationships, behaviors, social issues, conflicts. He allows the viewer to grasp these emotions that leave you thinking.  Ray has been known to use memorable characters with distinguished faces.If you plan on viewing this, see the Pather Panchali, the first of the trilogy.  You will learn that the family experiences economic, ecological & emotional hardships.  Tragedy strikes and the family moves to the city.  Sarbojaya endured lonliness and desperation, and sheer frustration while living in poverty.Now,  in the second movie, Aparajito, Sarbojaya faces a life without a husband, and her remaining child begs for an education; wins a scholarship and travels to Calcutta for further studies.  Like his father, Apu is now away from home on long stretches, as he will embark on a journey to be educated.  His mother tries to make him feel guilty about leaving, with no one to care for her, but he isn't too concerned about her lonliness.What  puzzled me was that this appears to be a loving family, but when Apu goes away to Calcutta to study, or arrives for a visit, his mother and he do not as much as exchange a hug.  Perhaps this is the custom, but I found it ironic.This DVD is at times difficult to read, with white letters against no black background.  And, unfortunately, the DVD lacks commentary!!  How wonderful it would be to have had commentary about Ray and his vision as a director.  If you value film from world's greatest directors, include Satyajit Ray ......Rizzo",5,Moving relationship between mother and son!,1120780800,"07 8, 2005",2005,1999,"['Apu', 'Trilogy', 'was', 'recently', 'named', 'Time', 'magazine', '100', 'greatest', 'films', 'Satyajit', 'Ray', '1921-1992', 'one', 'world', 'finest', 'directors', 'was', 'born', 'family', 'elite', 'musicians', 'physicians', 'scientist', 'author', 'illustrator', 'photographer', 'singer', 'etc', 'Made', 'late', '50', 'trilogy', 'set', '20', 'Ray', 'career', 'impressive', 'number', 'movies', 'books', 'documentaries', 'etc', 'Passionate', 'film', 'very', 'young', 'age', 'was', 'influenced', 'greatest.His', 'movies', 'capture', 'humanistic', 'elements', 'relationships', 'behaviors', 'social', 'issues', 'conflicts', 'viewer', 'grasp', 'emotions', 'leave', 'thinking', 'Ray', 'been', 'known', 'use', 'memorable', 'characters', 'distinguished', 'faces.If', 'plan', 'viewing', 'see', 'Pather', 'Panchali', 'first', 'trilogy', 'will', 'learn', 'family', 'economic', 'ecological', 'emotional', 'hardships', 'Tragedy', 'strikes', 'family', 'city', 'Sarbojaya', 'endured', 'lonliness', 'desperation', 'sheer', 'frustration', 'living', 'poverty.Now', 'second', 'movie', 'Aparajito', 'Sarbojaya', 'life', 'husband', 'remaining', 'child', 'begs', 'education', 'scholarship', 'travels', 'Calcutta', 'further', 'studies', 'father', 'Apu', 'now', 'away', 'home', 'long', 'stretches', 'will', 'embark', 'journey', 'be', 'educated', 'mother', 'tries', 'make', 'feel', 'guilty', 'leaving', 'one', 'care', ""n't"", 'too', 'concerned', 'lonliness.What', 'puzzled', 'was', 'be', 'loving', 'family', 'when', 'Apu', 'away', 'Calcutta', 'study', 'visit', 'mother', 'do', 'not', 'as', 'much', 'exchange', 'hug', 'Perhaps', 'custom', 'found', 'ironic.This', 'DVD', 'times', 'difficult', 'read', 'white', 'letters', 'black', 'background', 'unfortunately', 'DVD', 'commentary', 'How', 'wonderful', 'would', 'be', 'have', 'had', 'commentary', 'Ray', 'vision', 'director', 'value', 'film', 'world', 'greatest', 'directors', 'include', 'Satyajit', 'Ray', 'Rizzo']",Aparajito VHS
401133,A3SFO2GSP5CVSM,6304104278,"Cosmoetica ""cosmoeticadotcom""","[2, 2]","The first film of Satyajit Ray's Apu Trilogy, Pather Panchali, was such a great film that, naturally, the second film in the series was bound to suffer a bit of a let down. Thus, Aparajito (The Unvanquished)- based on the novel Aparajita, by Bibhutibhushan Banerjee, is not the unadulterated great piece of art that Pather Panchali is. Like many middle films of a series, it suffers from the infamous middle filmitis; when films that are not first in a series rely too heavily upon an audience's memories of earlier films to inform them of the traits of characters, the chronology of prior events, and a general knowledge of the world the film series is set in.Aparajito falls into this trap, however, in a way different from your average Hollywood blockbuster film. Whereas most middle films feel a need to fall back on what already passed in a first film, Aparajito spends too much time ignoring the traits and actions that occurred in Pather Panchali; almost as if Ray wanted to sever connections between the two films. He achieves this by having the film's lead character, Apu, not being played by the child who portrayed him in the first film- Subir Banerjee. In this film, Apu is first played by Pinaki Sen Gupta, when ten; and later by Smaran Ghosal, when in hi slate teens. Two of the actors from the first film were retained: Kanu Banerjee as Harihar- Apu's father, and his wife Sarbajaya- still played by Karuna Banerjee. However, there has been a major personality shift in Sarbajaya- likely the only evidence of the death of Durga- Apu's older sister, from the first film. Whereas Sarbajaya was bossy and condescending in the first film- while also being loving, in this film she's timid and let's life play her; whereas in the first film she was restive, and dissatisfied with what life brought....The abrupt and disappointing ending is merely the most manifest sign of this tendency to rely on the fact that the viewer will have seen Pather Panchali. If coming to Aparajito on its own, most viewers will be a) lost, or b) more likely simply not as prone to care for either Sarbajaya nor Apu.That stated, this is an excellent film which, asides from the death scenes, contains excellent poesy and metaphors- such as a scene where Apu enters Calcutta on a train, holding a small globe, given to him as a gift by the headmaster at the school in his mother's employer's village. The film also makes good use of humor, such as scenes where the young Apu plays around with monkeys and bells, and later, as a student, in an English class, where he falls asleep (due to working a job and his studiousness) during a lecture on synecdoche and metonymy. It also has moments of universality, such as when the mother and son reacquaint after a long stay at school, and the first thing Sarbajaya says is that Apu has grown taller and doesn't appear to be eating well, despite the fact that neither is true. But, the film's greatest strength is its depiction of fortuity. Despite its flaws, Aparajito is a great what if? movie- had his sister and father not died early, would Apu have ended up in college? Had his mother not been emotionally devastated by both losses, would she have domineered her son into submission when he wanted to go abroad? All of his family's losses, and deaths- his auntie, his sister, his father, his mother, all serve Apu's benefit. In short, death has been very, very good for Apu- both in allowing him to grow and removing obstacles to his own self-fulfillment, which may be the most damning (and tangential) criticism of religion (and its fetishizing by religion) that Ray makes in this whole film (as well as in the first film).Like the domestic troubles and idiocies that abound in a typical Yasujiro Ozu film, which almost always transcends to the universal, Satyajit Ray's films seem to likewise contain personal and comic moments that all viewers, from any background, can relate to. The problem with Aparajito- especially in relation to Pather Panchali, is that- as far as domestic troubles go, the first film's were more existential and deeper in nature, making those suffered in Aparajito seem trivial by comparison. But, that is the trouble with comparing excellent art to great art- it always suffers by the comparison. On its own, Aparajito is an outstanding film, and, hopefully, provides merely a relatively weak link to a final film that is the equal of Pather Panchali, and one that shows Apu finally taking center stage in his titular trilogy's plight.",4,Good,1225065600,"10 27, 2008",2008,4498,"['first', 'film', 'Satyajit', 'Ray', 'Apu', 'Trilogy', 'Pather', 'Panchali', 'was', 'such', 'great', 'film', 'naturally', 'second', 'film', 'series', 'was', 'bound', 'suffer', 'bit', 'let', 'down', 'Thus', 'Aparajito', 'Unvanquished', 'based', 'novel', 'Aparajita', 'Bibhutibhushan', 'Banerjee', 'not', 'unadulterated', 'great', 'piece', 'art', 'Pather', 'Panchali', 'many', 'middle', 'films', 'series', 'infamous', 'middle', 'filmitis', 'when', 'films', 'are', 'not', 'first', 'series', 'rely', 'too', 'heavily', 'audience', 'memories', 'earlier', 'films', 'inform', 'traits', 'characters', 'chronology', 'prior', 'events', 'general', 'knowledge', 'world', 'film', 'series', 'set', 'in.Aparajito', 'trap', 'however', 'way', 'different', 'average', 'Hollywood', 'blockbuster', 'film', 'most', 'middle', 'films', 'feel', 'need', 'fall', 'back', 'what', 'already', 'passed', 'first', 'film', 'Aparajito', 'too', 'much', 'time', 'ignoring', 'traits', 'actions', 'occurred', 'Pather', 'Panchali', 'almost', 'Ray', 'wanted', 'sever', 'connections', 'two', 'films', 'having', 'film', 'lead', 'character', 'Apu', 'not', 'being', 'played', 'child', 'who', 'portrayed', 'first', 'film-', 'Subir', 'Banerjee', 'film', 'Apu', 'first', 'played', 'Pinaki', 'Sen', 'Gupta', 'when', 'ten', 'later', 'Smaran', 'Ghosal', 'when', 'hi', 'slate', 'teens', 'Two', 'actors', 'first', 'film', 'were', 'retained', 'Kanu', 'Banerjee', 'Harihar-', 'Apu', 'father', 'wife', 'Sarbajaya-', 'still', 'played', 'Karuna', 'Banerjee', 'However', 'been', 'major', 'personality', 'shift', 'Sarbajaya-', 'likely', 'only', 'evidence', 'death', 'Durga-', 'Apu', 'older', 'sister', 'first', 'film', 'Whereas', 'Sarbajaya', 'was', 'bossy', 'condescending', 'first', 'film-', 'also', 'being', 'loving', 'film', 'timid', 'let', 'life', 'play', 'whereas', 'first', 'film', 'was', 'restive', 'dissatisfied', 'what', 'life', 'brought', '.The', 'abrupt', 'disappointing', 'ending', 'merely', 'most', 'manifest', 'sign', 'tendency', 'rely', 'fact', 'viewer', 'will', 'have', 'seen', 'Pather', 'Panchali', 'coming', 'Aparajito', 'own', 'most', 'viewers', 'will', 'be', 'lost', 'b', 'more', 'likely', 'simply', 'not', 'prone', 'care', 'Sarbajaya', 'Apu.That', 'stated', 'excellent', 'film', 'asides', 'death', 'scenes', 'contains', 'excellent', 'poesy', 'metaphors-', 'such', 'scene', 'where', 'Apu', 'Calcutta', 'train', 'holding', 'small', 'globe', 'given', 'gift', 'headmaster', 'school', 'mother', 'employer', 'village', 'film', 'also', 'good', 'use', 'humor', 'such', 'scenes', 'where', 'young', 'Apu', 'monkeys', 'bells', 'later', 'student', 'English', 'class', 'where', 'asleep', 'due', 'working', 'job', 'studiousness', 'lecture', 'synecdoche', 'metonymy', 'also', 'moments', 'universality', 'such', 'when', 'mother', 'son', 'reacquaint', 'long', 'stay', 'school', 'first', 'thing', 'Sarbajaya', 'Apu', 'grown', 'taller', ""n't"", 'appear', 'be', 'eating', 'well', 'fact', 'true', 'film', 'greatest', 'strength', 'depiction', 'fortuity', 'flaws', 'Aparajito', 'great', 'what', 'movie-', 'had', 'sister', 'father', 'not', 'died', 'early', 'would', 'Apu', 'have', 'ended', 'up', 'college', 'Had', 'mother', 'not', 'been', 'emotionally', 'devastated', 'losses', 'would', 'have', 'domineered', 'son', 'submission', 'when', 'wanted', 'go', 'abroad', 'family', 'losses', 'deaths-', 'auntie', 'sister', 'father', 'mother', 'serve', 'Apu', 'benefit', 'short', 'death', 'been', 'very', 'very', 'good', 'Apu-', 'allowing', 'grow', 'removing', 'obstacles', 'own', 'self-fulfillment', 'may', 'be', 'most', 'damning', 'tangential', 'criticism', 'religion', 'fetishizing', 'religion', 'Ray', 'whole', 'film', 'as', 'well', 'first', 'film', 'domestic', 'troubles', 'idiocies', 'abound', 'typical', 'Yasujiro', 'Ozu', 'film', 'almost', 'always', 'universal', 'Satyajit', 'Ray', 'films', 'seem', 'likewise', 'contain', 'personal', 'comic', 'moments', 'viewers', 'background', 'can', 'relate', 'problem', 'Aparajito-', 'especially', 'relation', 'Pather', 'Panchali', 'that-', 'as', 'far', 'domestic', 'troubles', 'go', 'first', 'film', 'were', 'more', 'existential', 'deeper', 'nature', 'making', 'suffered', 'Aparajito', 'seem', 'trivial', 'comparison', 'trouble', 'comparing', 'excellent', 'art', 'great', 'art-', 'always', 'suffers', 'comparison', 'own', 'Aparajito', 'outstanding', 'film', 'hopefully', 'merely', 'relatively', 'weak', 'link', 'final', 'film', 'equal', 'Pather', 'Panchali', 'one', 'Apu', 'finally', 'taking', 'center', 'stage', 'titular', 'trilogy', 'plight']",Aparajito VHS

This follows the life of this family, its joys, struggles and the choice Apu must make to either pursue the life of his father (as a priest) or venture out to Calcutta, as a scholarship student, to build a foundation for himself.This film was shot beautifully and is really a great example of marvelous storytelling.

On finishing the movie I came to the conclusion that it was in the 7/10 star range.  With Pather at a 9.5 and World of Apu at a stunning 10, this movie comes in third and is the lesser light in the trilogy, apparently reflected in the price.  If you watch this one last, as I did, you may find it doesn't reach the heights of the other two in terms pace and story. But the shots of Varanasi and the ghats were a surprise as I was there in 2006 and it was interesting to see that it looked pretty much the same as it did when the movie was filmed in 1956.Also recommended in the S.

This film was much easier to watch than the first.  If you had trouble with that film, I would recommend you first watch the 2001 NZ film Rain before moving onto this film.  Rain was obviously strongly influenced by Pather Panchali.By moving us slowly though Apu's life in the three movies, Ray shows us the world as it appeared coming out of a small rural Bengali village.  In the first film, Apu's father ventured out of the village, but the cameras never did.  In this film, Apu makes it to medium sized towns, and eventually to the Bengali Manhattan of Calcutta.If you enjoyed these films, I would recommend looking up the 1960 film &quot;A Cloud-Capped Star&quot; by director R. Ghatak.  For a look at an upscale Indian life that Apu would never see, Mira Nair's 2001 hit Monsoon Wedding is a nice antidote to Ray's brand of Dravidian misery (although I recommend watching it on DVD with the English subtitles on to ease understanding).As to the DVD quality of Aparajito, its really no better than the VHS tapes readily available, although its nice to see that the film is at least getting some attention.

In &quot;Pather Panchali&quot; it was Apu's sister Durga, while in &quot;Aparajito&quot; (&quot;The Unvanquished&quot;) it is his mother, Sarbajaya (Karuna Bannerjee).  After the tragic death of Durga and the destruction of the family's home, Harihar (Kanua Bannerjee) has taken his wife and son to live in the big city of Benares.  Harihar makes a meager living reading sacred texts by the holy Ganges River and selling herbal remedies.  But when he falls ill Sarbajaya has to learn to cope on her own and takes Apu to the country, where she works as the cook for a wealthy family.  Meanwhile, Apu turns out to be an excellent scholar and does well in school.  Eventually he goes away to the university in Calcutta.  Sarbajaya does not want her son to go, but she cannot stop him and while she waits patiently for him to come home she get sick and grows weaker.The climax of this film comes when Apu finally learns of his mother's illness and has to decide if he will stay for his final exams or return to her side and skip the exams.  Based on the novel &quot;Aparajito&quot; by Bibhutibhushan Banerjee, at the heart of Satyajit Ray's film adaptation is the performance of Bannerjee as a woman who has lost everything in the world except a beloved son who is to busy to even bother to write her a letter (like father, like son, for those who have seen &quot;Pather Panchali&quot;).  This film is not as powerful as it predecessor, but that is invariably true of all middle films in a movie trilogy, and the finale, &quot;Apur Sansar&quot; is a great climax.  However, there is also the fact that Apu is not a particularly sympathetic figure.  We appreciate that he is good at his studies, but that and life in the city consume him while his mother sits at home, getting weaker, and wondering when she will see him again.Two of the pillars on which Ray's cinematic success is based is his cinematographer, Subrata Mitra, who had been a still photographer when Ray drafted him to film these movies, and the then unknown Ravi Shankar, whose music often takes the place of voices in these films.  When they gave Ray his honorary Oscar in 1992, shortly before the director's death, they cited him: &quot;For his rare mastery of the art of motion pictures and for his profound humanitarian outlook, which has had an indelible influence on filmmakers and audiences throughout the world.&quot;  Individually and collectively, the Apu Trilogy certainly provides ample evidence in support of the claim.",5,The middle film of Satyajit Ray's Apu Trilogy,1074470400,"01 19, 2004",2004,2746,"['first', 'film', 'Apu', 'trilogy', 'once', 'again', 'find', 'more', 'interested', 'one', 'women', 'story', 'Apu', 'young', 'boy', 'Pinaki', 'Sengupta', 'turned', 'adolescent', 'Smaran', 'Ghosal', 'finally', 'something', 'do', 'quot', 'Pather', 'Panchali', 'quot', 'was', 'Apu', 'sister', 'Durga', 'quot', 'Aparajito', 'quot', 'quot', 'Unvanquished', 'quot', 'mother', 'Sarbajaya', 'Karuna', 'Bannerjee', 'tragic', 'death', 'Durga', 'destruction', 'family', 'home', 'Harihar', 'Kanua', 'Bannerjee', 'taken', 'wife', 'son', 'live', 'big', 'city', 'Benares', 'Harihar', 'meager', 'living', 'reading', 'sacred', 'texts', 'holy', 'Ganges', 'River', 'selling', 'herbal', 'remedies', 'when', 'ill', 'Sarbajaya', 'learn', 'cope', 'own', 'Apu', 'country', 'where', 'cook', 'wealthy', 'family', 'Meanwhile', 'Apu', 'out', 'be', 'excellent', 'scholar', 'well', 'school', 'Eventually', 'away', 'university', 'Calcutta', 'Sarbajaya', 'not', 'want', 'son', 'go', 'can', 'not', 'stop', 'patiently', 'come', 'home', 'get', 'sick', 'weaker.The', 'climax', 'film', 'when', 'Apu', 'finally', 'mother', 'illness', 'decide', 'will', 'stay', 'final', 'exams', 'return', 'side', 'skip', 'exams', 'Based', 'novel', 'quot', 'Aparajito', 'quot', 'Bibhutibhushan', 'Banerjee', 'heart', 'Satyajit', 'Ray', 'film', 'adaptation', 'performance', 'Bannerjee', 'woman', 'who', 'lost', 'everything', 'world', 'beloved', 'son', 'who', 'busy', 'even', 'bother', 'write', 'letter', 'father', 'son', 'who', 'have', 'seen', 'quot', 'Pather', 'Panchali', 'quot', 'film', 'not', 'as', 'powerful', 'invariably', 'true', 'middle', 'films', 'movie', 'trilogy', 'finale', 'quot', 'Apur', 'Sansar', 'quot', 'great', 'climax', 'However', 'also', 'fact', 'Apu', 'not', 'particularly', 'sympathetic', 'figure', 'appreciate', 'good', 'studies', 'life', 'city', 'consume', 'mother', 'sits', 'home', 'getting', 'weaker', 'wondering', 'when', 'will', 'see', 'again.Two', 'pillars', 'Ray', 'cinematic', 'success', 'based', 'cinematographer', 'Subrata', 'Mitra', 'who', 'had', 'been', 'still', 'photographer', 'when', 'Ray', 'drafted', 'film', 'movies', 'then', 'unknown', 'Ravi', 'Shankar', 'music', 'often', 'place', 'voices', 'films', 'When', 'gave', 'Ray', 'honorary', 'Oscar', '1992', 'shortly', 'director', 'death', 'cited', 'quot', 'rare', 'mastery', 'art', 'motion', 'pictures', 'profound', 'humanitarian', 'outlook', 'had', 'indelible', 'influence', 'filmmakers', 'audiences', 'world.', 'quot', 'Individually', 'collectively', 'Apu', 'Trilogy', 'certainly', 'ample', 'evidence', 'support', 'claim']",Aparajito VHS

It shouldn't because death is in the supporting cast for all of the trilogy of Apu movies and ""Aparajito"" is no exception.  We find Apu and his parents in a more urban environment than when we left them in ""Pather Panchali"".  Apu is studying to become a priest of sorts but he is still drawn to the academic world.  Trajedy ocurrs and an opportunity arises which eventually leads Apu to a scholarship to good school.  The essence of ""Aparajito"" is the series of decisions that he makes.  As with any young person emerging to adulthood, not all choices are easy nor do they all turn out the way you think they will.Director Ray has done a masterful job of creating a family in India and endearing them to us to a degree that we share in every emotional swing they go through.  Thus it is that ""Aparajito"" is both emotionally draing and emotionally uplifting.

401143,A281NPSIMI1C2R,6304104278,"Rebecca of Amazon ""The Rebecca Review""","[9, 10]","This is the second film in director Satyajit Ray's Apu Trilogy and is best viewed after Pather Panchali and followed by The World of Apu. Harihar (Kanu Bannerjee) takes his wife, Sarbajaya (Karuna Bannerjee) and their son Apu to live in Benares. Their family home has been destroyed in the monsoon and with the loss of their daughter, they are struggling to cope emotionally as well as financially.I found this movie to be more about the struggle Sarbajaya (Apu's mother) faces on a daily basis. She is an example of a woman who has given up her desires for the good of her family. As she cares for her family on a daily basis you can see how she is sinking into the darkest of depression. Not only is she terribly lonely, she does not fully recover from the loss of her daughter. While she is surrounded by members of her immediate community, she seems to strangely isolated and alone and the unfulfilled desires of her heart seem to weave an invisible and yet debilitating cocoon around her soul.Throughout this movie, her sacrifice becomes even more beautiful as it allows Apu to see some of his own dreams come to fruition. Apu's father makes his living reading sacred texts by the shores of the Ganges River and then suddenly falls ill. Apu must continue his education and find his own way in this harsh world.I love the scene where Apu pretends to miss the train and when his mother worries about what they are feeding him at school. The first few scenes also show birds sitting on umbrellas and then taking off suddenly. Could this be a foreshadowing for the situation in which Apu finally finds himself? I found these movies have quite a few ""foreshadowing"" moments that I only recognized on the second viewing. Which is why the Apu Trilogy must be watched more than once to be fully appreciated. These are finely woven stories that deal with the deepest human issues we all must face at some point in our lives.~The Rebecca Review",5,Sarbajaya's Struggle for Meaning,1081296000,"04 7, 2004",2004,1939,"['second', 'film', 'director', 'Satyajit', 'Ray', 'Apu', 'Trilogy', 'best', 'viewed', 'Pather', 'Panchali', 'followed', 'World', 'Apu', 'Harihar', 'Kanu', 'Bannerjee', 'wife', 'Sarbajaya', 'Karuna', 'Bannerjee', 'son', 'Apu', 'live', 'Benares', 'family', 'home', 'been', 'destroyed', 'monsoon', 'loss', 'daughter', 'are', 'struggling', 'cope', 'emotionally', 'as', 'well', 'financially.I', 'found', 'movie', 'be', 'more', 'struggle', 'Sarbajaya', 'Apu', 'mother', 'daily', 'basis', 'example', 'woman', 'who', 'given', 'up', 'desires', 'good', 'family', 'family', 'daily', 'basis', 'can', 'see', 'how', 'sinking', 'darkest', 'depression', 'Not', 'only', 'terribly', 'lonely', 'not', 'fully', 'recover', 'loss', 'daughter', 'surrounded', 'members', 'immediate', 'community', 'strangely', 'isolated', 'alone', 'unfulfilled', 'desires', 'heart', 'seem', 'weave', 'invisible', 'yet', 'debilitating', 'cocoon', 'soul.Throughout', 'movie', 'sacrifice', 'even', 'more', 'beautiful', 'Apu', 'see', 'own', 'dreams', 'come', 'fruition', 'Apu', 'father', 'living', 'reading', 'sacred', 'texts', 'shores', 'Ganges', 'River', 'then', 'suddenly', 'ill.', 'Apu', 'must', 'continue', 'education', 'find', 'own', 'way', 'harsh', 'world.I', 'love', 'scene', 'where', 'Apu', 'miss', 'train', 'when', 'mother', 'worries', 'what', 'are', 'feeding', 'school', 'first', 'few', 'scenes', 'also', 'show', 'birds', 'sitting', 'umbrellas', 'then', 'taking', 'off', 'suddenly', 'Could', 'be', 'foreshadowing', 'situation', 'Apu', 'finally', 'found', 'movies', 'have', 'quite', 'few', 'foreshadowing', 'moments', 'only', 'recognized', 'second', 'viewing', 'Which', 'why', 'Apu', 'Trilogy', 'must', 'be', 'watched', 'more', 'once', 'be', 'fully', 'appreciated', 'are', 'finely', 'woven', 'stories', 'deal', 'deepest', 'human', 'issues', 'must', 'face', 'point', 'lives.~The', 'Rebecca', 'Review']",Aparajito VHS

Aparajito is the second installment in a famous film series titled The Apu Trilogy. When you start watching this you know it is a necessaryand valid installment because you are immediately concerned about the characters. This film directly follows the first film Pather Panchali. The first film is a deep meditation about life and an impoverished family just struggling to survive. The plot is simple and the concepts are plentiful. When you see the characters in this second film you are happy to see them again. In this installment the family moves to the city and once again tragedy ensues. The outcome is dramatic & harsh just like the first film. Once again this movie deals a strong dose of the harsh realities of existence. A real movie that involves thought and attention. While you are watching this film you will think about life. Everyone that enjoys the power of film should watch The Apu Trilogy.,5,The Empire 5 Star 500 - #42,1306627200,"05 29, 2011",2011,993,"['What', 'do', 'think', 'will', 'happen', 'next', 'Right', 'away', 'can', 'sense', 'real', 'squeal', 'Aparajito', 'second', 'installment', 'famous', 'film', 'series', 'titled', 'Apu', 'Trilogy', 'When', 'start', 'watching', 'know', 'necessaryand', 'valid', 'installment', 'are', 'immediately', 'concerned', 'characters', 'film', 'directly', 'first', 'film', 'Pather', 'Panchali', 'first', 'film', 'deep', 'meditation', 'life', 'impoverished', 'family', 'just', 'struggling', 'survive', 'plot', 'simple', 'concepts', 'are', 'plentiful', 'When', 'see', 'characters', 'second', 'film', 'are', 'happy', 'see', 'again', 'installment', 'family', 'city', 'once', 'again', 'tragedy', 'ensues', 'outcome', 'dramatic', 'harsh', 'just', 'first', 'film', 'Once', 'again', 'movie', 'strong', 'dose', 'harsh', 'realities', 'existence', 'real', 'movie', 'thought', 'attention', 'are', 'watching', 'film', 'will', 'think', 'life', 'Everyone', 'power', 'film', 'should', 'watch', 'Apu', 'Trilogy']",Aparajito VHS
