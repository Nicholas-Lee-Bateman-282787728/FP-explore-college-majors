Her mother played by Gail Patrickis glamorous actress in Hollywood who has to hide that she has a fourteen year old daughter studying in a boarding school in Switzerland.Since Deanna had told this fib that her Father is a explorer cum hunter she asks her mother to ship various trophies of a hunt like ivory tusk.I was so surprised by such amount of lies told by everybody,I don't think in any other movie I have seen people lie so much.A boy named Tommy played by Jackie Moran {Tom Sawyer (1938), Since You Went Away (1944)} takes a liking to Deanna and ask her for a date at a coffee shop.She lies to the head-mistress that her father is coming to meet her and to let her go.Now her class-mates follow her to the coffee shop where the boy gives her a bouquet.Her friend Olga { Marcia Mae Jones} comes and tell Deanna that her classmates have followed her to see her father on insistence of Felice {Helen Parrish}Felice is convinced that its all a lie a cock and bull story.From there she goes to railway station to meet her father who is non-existent and not coming.When the train arrives she hand the bouquet that her boy-friend gave to the person who seems most like her hunter father,Richard Todd played by Herbert Marshall who actually is a Music Composer ,saying its a Swiss custom to welcome guests.And later on accompanies this man and his secretary to his hotel just to convince her friends.",5,nice movie where Deanna tells umpteenth lies,1378166400,"09 3, 2013",2013,2002,"['Taking', 'break', 'watching', 'latest', 'movies', 'Multiplex', 'may', 'turn', 'out', 'boring', 'may', 'doze', 'off', 'decided', 'watch', 'classics', 'had', 'long', 'time', 'Mad', 'Music', 'turned', 'out', 'be', 'refreshing', 'Deanna', 'Durbin', 'classmates', 'singing', 'love', 'Whistle', 'just', 'rolling', 'titles.Film', 'really', 'pleasant', 'Deanna', 'utmost', 'beautiful', 'effortless', 'singing.Deanna', 'Durbin', 'left', '20', 'th', 'April', '2013.Deanna', 'who', 'Gloria', 'Harkinson', 'up', 'wild', 'stories', 'non-existent', 'father', 'later', 'movie', 'umpteenth', 'lies', 'hide', 'one', 'lie', 'mother', 'played', 'Gail', 'Patrickis', 'glamorous', 'actress', 'Hollywood', 'who', 'hide', 'fourteen', 'year', 'old', 'daughter', 'studying', 'boarding', 'school', 'Switzerland.Since', 'Deanna', 'had', 'told', 'fib', 'Father', 'explorer', 'cum', 'hunter', 'mother', 'ship', 'various', 'trophies', 'hunt', 'ivory', 'tusk.I', 'was', 'so', 'surprised', 'such', 'amount', 'lies', 'told', 'everybody', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'other', 'movie', 'have', 'seen', 'people', 'lie', 'so', 'much.A', 'boy', 'named', 'Tommy', 'played', 'Jackie', 'Moran', 'Tom', 'Sawyer', '1938', 'Went', 'Away', '1944', 'liking', 'Deanna', 'ask', 'date', 'coffee', 'shop.She', 'head-mistress', 'father', 'coming', 'meet', 'let', 'go.Now', 'class-mates', 'follow', 'coffee', 'shop', 'where', 'boy', 'bouquet.Her', 'friend', 'Olga', 'Marcia', 'Mae', 'Jones', 'tell', 'Deanna', 'classmates', 'have', 'followed', 'see', 'father', 'insistence', 'Felice', 'Helen', 'Parrish', 'Felice', 'convinced', 'lie', 'cock', 'bull', 'story.From', 'there', 'railway', 'station', 'meet', 'father', 'who', 'non-existent', 'not', 'coming.When', 'train', 'hand', 'bouquet', 'boy-friend', 'gave', 'person', 'who', 'most', 'hunter', 'father', 'Richard', 'Todd', 'played', 'Herbert', 'Marshall', 'who', 'actually', 'Music', 'Composer', 'saying', 'Swiss', 'custom', 'welcome', 'guests.And', 'later', 'accompanies', 'man', 'secretary', 'hotel', 'just', 'convince', 'friends']",Mad about Music VHS

389913,A24XYRH5NG3XJX,6303929982,"Jim Andrews ""Wayne Brasler""","[27, 28]","Durbin's best film, a totally illogical piece of nonsense set at a totally impossible girls' school in a Switzerland which only has existed in gingerbread houses.  Parts of the school look like it was designed for the  Seven Dwarfs.  The plot, which has Deanna raised apart from her movie star  mom who doesn't dare let the world know--gasp!--she has a teenaged  daughter, makes NO sense at any level.  Playing the mom, Gail Patrick looks  like she's about to pause at any second, look straight at the camera and  say, &quot;How the Hell am I supposed to play this poor woman--she's an  idiot and I'm obviously supposed to make her sympathetic.&quot;  Durbin is  darling, delightful, all pep and carbonation, and sings like an angel.  She  suffers beautifully when she suffers and can ride a bike and give out with  the vocals at the same time (!).  I love this totally screwy film.  Did  ANYONE believe ANY of it when it came out?  Dunno but it was a GIGANTIC  hit.",5,Mad About Deanna,940636800,"10 23, 1999",1999,966,"['Durbin', 'best', 'film', 'totally', 'illogical', 'piece', 'nonsense', 'set', 'totally', 'impossible', 'girls', 'school', 'Switzerland', 'only', 'existed', 'gingerbread', 'houses', 'Parts', 'school', 'look', 'was', 'designed', 'Seven', 'Dwarfs', 'plot', 'Deanna', 'raised', 'apart', 'movie', 'star', 'mom', 'who', ""n't"", 'dare', 'let', 'world', 'know', 'gasp', 'teenaged', 'daughter', 'NO', 'sense', 'level', 'Playing', 'mom', 'Gail', 'Patrick', 'pause', 'second', 'look', 'straight', 'camera', 'say', 'quot', 'Hell', 'am', 'supposed', 'play', 'poor', 'woman', 'idiot', ""'m"", 'obviously', 'supposed', 'make', 'sympathetic.', 'quot', 'Durbin', 'darling', 'delightful', 'pep', 'carbonation', 'sings', 'angel', 'beautifully', 'when', 'suffers', 'can', 'ride', 'bike', 'give', 'out', 'vocals', 'same', 'time', 'love', 'totally', 'screwy', 'film', 'Did', 'ANYONE', 'believe', 'ANY', 'when', 'came', 'out', 'Dunno', 'was', 'GIGANTIC', 'hit']",Mad about Music VHS

When a stranger (Herbert Marshall) comes to town she pretends he's her dad, to satsify her doubtful shoolmates.
