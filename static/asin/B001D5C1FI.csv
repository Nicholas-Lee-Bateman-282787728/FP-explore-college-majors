He may be blunt and honest and extremely vulgar....but his comedy is just of epic proportions.

He also is very original by thinking of things people never do, such as the cliche topics and conversation and phrases at funerals and weddings.  He also makes you think with the analogies.

Carlin probably is in large measure the stereotypical cynical, cranky old man. But he must be self-aware enough of that fact to wrap it all in humor. It is often a very biting humor, but he is so outrageous with some of it that it is hystericalMy favorite part is his dissection of religion. His mockery of it is rooted in a commonsensical analysis. He pokes fun at it, while genuinely believing that those who embrace the supernatural, er, bunk, are nuts.I'm less tickled by much of his political material which strikes me as virulently anti-American and, in particular, left-wing on the loony side. But some of it is funny.I'm not a fan of bits where he goes on too long in a sort of a Milton Berle goofiness. Just not my bag. But if you are already a Carlin fan, you'll love it.

This is also probably Carlin's smartest show, while also being his least hostile. While he's aggressive and critical as always (""They never hear those all important words: ""You lost, Bobby! You're a loser!""), they're insightful - everyone can't expect to be a winner. Losing is an important part of life.It's also George's softest, where he gives hints that he does believe (somewhat) in a higher power. While he says, ""There IS no 'up there'"", he goes on later to talk about how God would never pick favorites, and quotes Proverbs as well (""Pride cometh before the fall."") He also reveals that despite his 14 shows he actually LIKES people (in short doses) - which sets up some of the funniest lines in his long career (""You remember my neighbor with the burns on 90 percent of her body? Well, she burned the other 10 percent now. She was lighting a fart and her bush caught fire!"")He's also visibly waning in health - his posture is somewhat hunched, his voice weaker - though crustier.

There is much more to the set..and while  I slightly prefer the previous Life is Worth Losing due to its in your face wake  up approach..there is much to enjoy here and take  note of ....George claims  that we are soft and easily placated with cellphones that make  us pancake and rub our balls!  ...and  he's right.
