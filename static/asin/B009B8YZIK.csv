But I like sci-fi flicks, particularly those where well armed soldiers fight off alien creatures. So how did I miss this little gem? Go figure.Here's the scoop. You meet some new recruits in the academy to train soldiers whose express purpose seems to be to kill 'insurrectionists.' All the cadets we meet have parents high up in the ranks. All are drinking the Koolaid save for one (Thomas Lasky) who's not certain their mission is an admirable one. They train and are ready to do their thing when, all of the sudden, they come under alien attack. Some super robot comes to pull their ashes out of the fire and the next chapter is set up.This is an oddly compelling movie. The structure is odd in that there is no story or character arc. The viewer is taken through a series of episodes and is set up to go one place when, in the blink of an eye, he ends up headed someplace else. And this happens in the last twenty or thirty minutes so there isn't much time to wrap things up, which they don't. But, for a TV movie this is way beyond anything I've ever seen. Since ""Star Wars"" and ""Bladerunner"", film makers have gotten to realize that one of the keys to a good sci-fi movie is the look and feel, and they deliver that here in spades.

Dialog sounds as if it was written by people in high school. There was only one memorable line in the whole thing. Lots of teenage angst, which is pretty much all you get for the first half. Master Chief only shows up at the end. He has very few lines, and for some inexplicable reason he isn't voiced by Steve Downes, who provides the voice of Master Chief in all the games. If there is one glaring disappointment in this it's not hearing Master Chief's iconic voice deliver Master Chief's lines.Corbulo Academy apparently only has one vehicle, the warthog they built for this production, and they're not shy about including it in scenes. Halo fanboys will love the fact that the academy's commander rides around the academy in a loud two-seat monster truck with a machine gun turret on the back, but it seemed pretty silly to me.There's lots of heavily stylized camera work, mostly extreme closeups of kids suffering from teenage angst or running through forests and lots of shaky camera work. There is virtually no plot or real story here.You can watch this in high definition in five episodes on YouTube and I recommend you do so before laying out money for it. If you're a true Halo fan you'll probably want it even with all its shortcomings, but if you're not a Halo fan thinking this is going to be good, standalone sci-fi you're going to be disappointed.Frankly I wasn't expecting much, but I'm disappointed by not being pleasantly surprised, if that makes sense. 343 Industries, the Microsoft subsidiary created to produce and manage all things Halo has failed to impress me on a regular basis. Halo 4 has lots of bugs and there's a pretty good list of basic features you'd expect it to have that are conspicuously missing. Halo CE: Anniversary had bugs, and Reach has had some problems since they took over from Bungie. So this lame effort seems consistent with their other efforts in my opinion. And yes, I'm a Halo fan.Update: Obviously my review has offended the fanboy community, but I stand by it. Being a Halo fan doesn't mean one needs to be an apologist for all things Halo anymore than being a Star Trek fan means you have to adore all things Star Trek. The flaws in this are not excused by some tidbits of information from Halo novels or other parts of the Halo universe. This was a weak production (outside of some of the special effects and the audio) of a weak story.

The premise and setting are prime stock for an on-screen adaptation, however Hollywood's go at video game movies has a horrible track record (yes, I'm looking at you, Uwe Boll).  So, needless to say, I was a bit apprehensive about HALO: FORWARD UNTO DAWN when I first heard about it.  I mean, it had minimal promotion to begin with, and then I found out it was a web series...ouch!  But then I sat down and watched the DVD version...and WOW...I was blown away!  This is one video game adaptation that truly does its source material justice!HALO: FORWARD UNTO DAWN is a serious adaptation that should make even the stoutest of Halo fans happy.  It looks great, but it also bears the dark and gritty feel that military movies should have.  The acting is superb and the action is intense; add to this a nice selection of practical and visual effects, and the result is a stellar film that will entertain and impress.There are so many things to like here.  As mentioned, the acting is top notch with Tom Green and Anna Popplewell leading a great cast.  Although I am not very familiar with their previous work (Popplewell's most notable appearance prior to this was in the CHRONICLES OF NARNIA series), Green and Popplewell display massive talent in this film and play off of each other very well.Also, as I previously mentioned, the special effects in HALO: FORWARD UNTO DAWN look great.  The production team spent a lot of time to get the details from the game correct, and the effort definitely pays off.  I found myself grinning a couple of times when I recognized a weapon or piece of equipment from the game.  Even Master Chief's armor, which could be difficult to actually construct, looks realistic.  This was a major point for impressing me overall.But the storyline is what truly made me breathe a content sigh of relief.  The studio actually got it right!  They didn't deviate and try to make a nonsensical movie that only borrowed slightly from the game itself (like the travesty that is DOOM), nor did they try to recreate a new mythology that was not already there.  The production team stays true-to-form and delivers an outstanding film that every director considering a game-to-movie project should watch.HALO: FORWARD UNTO DAWN is an absolute blast and I highly recommend giving it a look.  Even if you're not a fan of the game, you will still enjoy this military science-fiction masterpiece.

That turned out to be the case, in fact it starts really well with Cortana slowly losing her mind on the Forward Unto Dawn while the Masterchief is in cryo-sleep.Her distress beacon is picked up by another UNSC ship whose commander has a personal connection with the Masterchief.That promising start is eroded somewhat by the body of the film which is the flashback of that connection back during the cadet training programme. This part of the film isn't great, it's not terrible, but it's no Full Metal Jacket. In fact in many ways it reminded me of some of the higher quality fan made movies.Things do pick up when the Masterchief makes his appearance when the academy is attacked by the Covenent, although maybe my memory is failing me, but it didn't sound like the same voice actor from the game. However the attack is more fun to watch and a Spartan in action is always fun to watch.Somebody has also been watching too much Spartacus as it suffers from the same excessive slow motion whenever something vaguely interesting it happens.

And if you have not played Halo, this movie would make no sense at all (especially the last 10 minutes of the movie).Spoiler Alert:  I love it when the soldiers tells the cadets they are the only 4 survivors of the planet - really, come on, no warning of a war or anything, not one enemy soldier ever seen up to that point but the world is conquered? I guess communications were down for the whole war such that noone had any idea what was going on???  I guess that fleet taking off in the end came from another planet or something.

If you like where they have gone with the franchise then maybe this is for you. It just didn't ring true for me.I think some of the other live action short films have been very good. The Peter Jackson/Neil Blomkamp stuff, the snippets for Halo 3, ODST and Reach, etc. Just makes you see how good a real Halo movie could be.There are some Halo moments in Forward Unto Dawn for sure, but they are spread thin.Yes, they built an actual Wart Hog (or possibly got one from Peter Jackson) but this is used way too much in the movie. It's in too many scenes and it doesn't look like it can go very fast. The actors look frail. Like a left over casting call from Twilight. There is a lot of touchy feely stuff that has no business in the Halo universe. The assault rifles look like they are made of plastic and the actors handle them like Nerf guns. The lead actress gets killed with a single needle (I think) from a Needler. Could they have thrown in a MAP FROM THE GAME when they are playing capture the flag or whatever they are doing? They use some silly tactic to win that's not possible to do in the actual game. Possibly talking to a few people who have played the game would have helped.They discuss military tactics like they are talking to a 3rd grader and show a graphic about it that makes no sense.

It has a slightly cheap element to the film making that doesn't match up with the epicness of the Halo games, hence the disappointment.The detail is pretty good, but there are some major flaws. Spartan armor doesn't have numbers on it, and everyone who's played the game knows that, but the biggest flaw is the timeline.

This is not some fan service that only the Halo devotees can enjoy, this a great movie with great acting, a compelling narrative and solid action.Forward Unto Dawn follows a group of cadets in a top tier military academy, particularly Private Lasky (who we see in Halo 4).  Lasky  brings to the forefront some major themes of the Halo-verse that have only seen much consideration in some of the books.  The uncertainty of war, the complication of the civil war preceding the Covenant-Human war and the fear and bravery that accompany any conflict.It's very exciting to see the Covenant War begin and get to see how frightening it was to all of the personnel and troops who weren't Spartans.  The Covenant are mysterious, scary and portrayed in a visceral way.And of course, we get the larger-than-life awesomeness of seeing a real life master chief in action.Don't write this off as something only for the hardcore Halo fans, this is a film that a casual fan, or even just a movie fan, can enjoy.Great action, great characters and great story, all done with a tiny budget that never feels tiny.",5,Amazingly good film done with an amazingly small budget - for the movie lover or Halo fan,1386115200,"12 4, 2013",2013,1375,"['do', ""n't"", 'think', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'given', 'something', '5', 'stars', 'did', '5', 'stars', 'not', 'perfect', 'experience', 'what', 'accomplished.With', 'small', 'budget', '343i', 'was', 'able', 'pull', 'off', 'well', 'told', 'exciting', 'live', 'action', 'movie', 'Halo', 'universe', 'not', 'fan', 'service', 'only', 'Halo', 'devotees', 'can', 'enjoy', 'great', 'movie', 'great', 'acting', 'compelling', 'narrative', 'solid', 'action.Forward', 'Unto', 'Dawn', 'group', 'cadets', 'top', 'tier', 'military', 'academy', 'particularly', 'Private', 'Lasky', 'who', 'see', 'Halo', '4', 'Lasky', 'brings', 'forefront', 'major', 'themes', 'Halo-verse', 'have', 'only', 'seen', 'much', 'consideration', 'books', 'uncertainty', 'war', 'complication', 'civil', 'war', 'preceding', 'Covenant-Human', 'war', 'fear', 'bravery', 'conflict.It', 'very', 'exciting', 'see', 'Covenant', 'War', 'begin', 'get', 'see', 'how', 'frightening', 'was', 'personnel', 'troops', 'who', 'were', ""n't"", 'Spartans', 'Covenant', 'are', 'mysterious', 'scary', 'portrayed', 'visceral', 'way.And', 'course', 'get', 'larger-than-life', 'awesomeness', 'seeing', 'real', 'life', 'master', 'chief', 'action.Do', ""n't"", 'write', 'off', 'something', 'only', 'hardcore', 'Halo', 'fans', 'film', 'casual', 'fan', 'even', 'just', 'movie', 'fan', 'can', 'enjoy.Great', 'action', 'great', 'characters', 'great', 'story', 'done', 'tiny', 'budget', 'never', 'tiny']",Halo 4: Forward Unto Dawn

The scene is juxtaposed with various training montages and shots of CAMS & UNSC military personnel.2) The opening/closing credits are longer.3) There is an approximately 4-minute blooper reel following the end credits.And that's it!  Unfortunately, no added action scenes, gore, or extended clips of Master Chief.  If you've watched the webisodes, then you've watched the majority of the movie.I've never been much of a Halo gaming fan, although I have always found the mythology fascinating.  I had high hopes for a Halo movie when Neill Blomkamp first directed the Halo 3: Landfall shorts.  FUD gives us a taste of what we can look forward to and I hope Microsoft acts quickly.  With the new Star Wars trilogy slated to be released in 2015+, perhaps there will be renewed demand for sci-fi movies.Despite its low budget, FUD has high production values and good CGI.  Battlestar Galactica veterans like Mike Dopud (Specialist Gage) and Ty Olsson (Captain Kelly) make appearances as the superintendent of CAMS and an older Lasky, respectively.  The plotline is Starship Trooper-esque (the movie, not the book) formulaic.  Young group of cadets enroll in military academy, with certain fortuitous events occurring just before the main character decides to abandon his promising military career.  FUD builds up slowly before Master Chief is unveiled but it's an unforgettable entrance.  I appreciated FUD's attention to detail, such as showing falling bodies when the space tether was destroyed, Fred-104 in Master Chief's field of view, ODSTs dropping into battle, and Master Chief's emphasis on pistol usage.I did have an issue with the end scene where Lasky acts as a decoy to save Master Chief and his fellow cadets.  I thought the point of FUD was to show Lasky's evolving maturity, but he only seemed like his usual reckless self.Given FUD's internet popularity, I think this bodes well for a potential cinematic incarnation.",5,Differences between Extended Cut (limited edition) and Webisodes,1353024000,"11 16, 2012",2012,2335,"['following', 'differences', 'webisodes', 'full', 'Forward', 'Unto', 'Dawn', 'hereinafter', 'FUD', 'movie', 'SPOILERS', 'FOLLOW', ':1', '4-minute', 'pre-opening', 'credits', 'scene', 'incoming', 'freshman', 'cadets', 'Lasky', 'Vickers', 'Sully', 'Chen', 'Silva', 'Tchakova', 'upperclassman', 'Orenski', 'getting', 'heads', 'shaved', 'and/or', 'delivering', 'brief', 'speeches', 'regarding', 'purposes', 'joining', 'CAMS', 'scene', 'juxtaposed', 'various', 'training', 'montages', 'shots', 'CAMS', 'UNSC', 'military', 'personnel.2', 'opening/closing', 'credits', 'are', 'longer.3', 'approximately', '4-minute', 'blooper', 'reel', 'following', 'end', 'credits.And', 'Unfortunately', 'added', 'action', 'scenes', 'gore', 'extended', 'clips', 'Master', 'Chief', ""'ve"", 'watched', 'webisodes', 'then', ""'ve"", 'watched', 'majority', 'movie.I', ""'ve"", 'never', 'been', 'much', 'Halo', 'gaming', 'fan', 'have', 'always', 'found', 'mythology', 'fascinating', 'had', 'high', 'hopes', 'Halo', 'movie', 'when', 'Neill', 'Blomkamp', 'first', 'directed', 'Halo', '3', 'Landfall', 'shorts', 'FUD', 'taste', 'what', 'can', 'look', 'forward', 'hope', 'Microsoft', 'acts', 'quickly', 'new', 'Star', 'Wars', 'trilogy', 'slated', 'be', 'released', '2015+', 'perhaps', 'will', 'be', 'renewed', 'demand', 'sci-fi', 'movies.Despite', 'low', 'budget', 'FUD', 'high', 'production', 'values', 'good', 'CGI', 'Battlestar', 'Galactica', 'veterans', 'Mike', 'Dopud', 'Specialist', 'Gage', 'Ty', 'Olsson', 'Captain', 'Kelly', 'make', 'appearances', 'superintendent', 'CAMS', 'older', 'Lasky', 'respectively', 'plotline', 'Starship', 'Trooper-esque', 'movie', 'not', 'book', 'formulaic', 'Young', 'group', 'cadets', 'enroll', 'military', 'academy', 'certain', 'fortuitous', 'events', 'occurring', 'just', 'main', 'character', 'decides', 'abandon', 'promising', 'military', 'career', 'FUD', 'up', 'slowly', 'Master', 'Chief', 'unveiled', 'unforgettable', 'entrance', 'appreciated', 'FUD', 'attention', 'detail', 'such', 'showing', 'falling', 'bodies', 'when', 'space', 'tether', 'was', 'destroyed', 'Fred-104', 'Master', 'Chief', 'field', 'view', 'ODSTs', 'dropping', 'battle', 'Master', 'Chief', 'emphasis', 'pistol', 'usage.I', 'did', 'have', 'issue', 'end', 'scene', 'where', 'Lasky', 'decoy', 'save', 'Master', 'Chief', 'fellow', 'cadets', 'thought', 'point', 'FUD', 'was', 'show', 'Lasky', 'evolving', 'maturity', 'only', 'seemed', 'usual', 'reckless', 'self.Given', 'FUD', 'internet', 'popularity', 'think', 'well', 'potential', 'cinematic', 'incarnation']",Halo 4: Forward Unto Dawn

When this movie started I thought it had great potential. The opening was in a surprisingly natural documentary style. The characters were being developed and the story was interesting. As the movie progressed, it was slow at times, somewhat unbelievable at times, maybe a bit simple, but it still kept my attention through most of it.In the last quarter of the movie it turned. It became entirely unbelievable, and it seemed like the producers were trying to integrate the video game, taking it from a sci-fi with realism and some depth through the various characters, to a kind of cartoonish and shallow movie.I don't want to give away too much in case you want to see it, but by the very end, I wished I could take back the time it took to watch the movie. I'm guessing that those gamers who know the back story will have a better experience. Also the movie clearly was making way for a sequel, so almost nothing was resolved and there were no answers.For me, it wasn't a movie I could recommend.",3,Great start - Poor end,1356825600,"12 30, 2012",2012,1077,"[""'m"", 'new', 'Halo', 'know', 'nothing', 'franchise', 'am', 'sci-fi', 'fan', 'When', 'movie', 'started', 'thought', 'had', 'great', 'potential', 'opening', 'was', 'surprisingly', 'natural', 'documentary', 'style', 'characters', 'were', 'being', 'developed', 'story', 'was', 'interesting', 'movie', 'progressed', 'was', 'slow', 'times', 'somewhat', 'unbelievable', 'times', 'maybe', 'bit', 'simple', 'still', 'kept', 'attention', 'most', 'it.In', 'last', 'quarter', 'movie', 'turned', 'became', 'entirely', 'unbelievable', 'seemed', 'producers', 'were', 'trying', 'integrate', 'video', 'game', 'taking', 'sci-fi', 'realism', 'depth', 'various', 'characters', 'kind', 'cartoonish', 'shallow', 'movie.I', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'give', 'away', 'too', 'much', 'case', 'want', 'see', 'very', 'end', 'wished', 'could', 'take', 'back', 'time', 'took', 'watch', 'movie', ""'m"", 'guessing', 'gamers', 'who', 'know', 'back', 'story', 'will', 'have', 'better', 'experience', 'Also', 'movie', 'clearly', 'was', 'making', 'way', 'sequel', 'so', 'almost', 'nothing', 'was', 'resolved', 'were', 'answers.For', 'was', ""n't"", 'movie', 'could', 'recommend']",Halo 4: Forward Unto Dawn
1594690,A3A4ZAIBQWKOZS,B009B8YZIK,Stephen M. Lerch,"[2, 3]","Short review:Forward Unto Dawn on Blu Ray includes all of the Forward Unto Dawn content, only available with the purchase of Halo 4's limited edition set. This alone, if you are a Halo fan that skipped the high price of the Halo 4 LE set, is worth the price. If you aren't a fan of Halo, this movie won't change your mind and you are best served just skipping it.Longer review:Forward Unto Dawn is a live action Halo film, taking place before any of the events of Halo 4. Master Chief makes a grand appearance and despite not being voiced by Steve Downes, is still fairly well done. I have to say, Steve Downes IS Master Chief, and the fact that they didn't use him for this role is quite disappointing. I can, however, &#34;get over it&#34; and enjoy the film regardless. Some, however, are not likely so easy to overlook this. One thing that would likely be even more egregious, would have been had they changed Cortana's voice (even though she doesn't play that significant a role), and thankfully I can report that Jen Taylor DOES indeed reprise this role.Video:High quality, well encoded and not video issues to be seen. At all. You can't ask for better.Audio:So here's where I am a little torn. The audio is flawless in sound quality and presentation, both in Stereo and Surround. No question and no problem there. The one issue I have, however, is that whoever mastered this audio made sure it was LOUD. I use my Blu Ray player and surround sound system religiously. I know about where a properly mastered Hollywood Blu Ray/DVD should be on my receiver and have it sound good. For me, this is the -22 to -25 range. On this disc, however, I had to turn this down... &#34;way&#34; down. To make the sound effects comfortable I had to drop the audio down to -37, otherwise the bass was rattling my teeth and the rest of the house. I like good, booming explosions, heart pumping gunshots and guttural Covenant screams as much as the next Halo fan, but man, they really over did it on this part.This is, however, a fairly minor gripe all told (turning the volume knob or pressing the button on the remote is simple enough), but enough of a gripe for me to mention it.Extras:3 - YES, THREE, commentary tracks (each worth a listen... no really, I mean it)A making of featurette (worth watching as well)Extended interview sequences, along with deeper information on the studentsCorbulo recruitment videoRed vs Blue special (I think this is exclusive and done just for this release, but am not positive)None of the extras on their own are amazing, but put together, and the fact that you could watch the episodes for &#34;free&#34; XBox Live, really rounds out a good set.Over all:If you're a Halo fan, it's worth it if you can get over a different voice for Master Chief (who really only appears in the last 30-45 minutes or so). The only reason I can see, other than the free version, for a person not wanting to lay down the cash for this is if you have to view it in original episode form. For this release, they took all of the episodes and mashed them together (and rearranged some pieces) so you can't just view it by episode. With the way the story flows though, this for me is the superior version.Recommended",5,Well done,1357084800,"01 2, 2013",2013,3216,"['Short', 'review', 'Forward', 'Unto', 'Dawn', 'Blu', 'Ray', 'Forward', 'Unto', 'Dawn', 'content', 'only', 'available', 'purchase', 'Halo', '4', 'limited', 'edition', 'set', 'alone', 'are', 'Halo', 'fan', 'skipped', 'high', 'price', 'Halo', '4', 'LE', 'set', 'price', 'are', ""n't"", 'fan', 'Halo', 'movie', 'wo', ""n't"", 'change', 'mind', 'are', 'best', 'served', 'just', 'skipping', 'it.Longer', 'review', 'Forward', 'Unto', 'Dawn', 'live', 'action', 'Halo', 'film', 'taking', 'place', 'events', 'Halo', '4', 'Master', 'Chief', 'grand', 'appearance', 'not', 'being', 'voiced', 'Steve', 'Downes', 'still', 'fairly', 'well', 'done', 'have', 'say', 'Steve', 'Downes', 'IS', 'Master', 'Chief', 'fact', 'did', ""n't"", 'use', 'role', 'quite', 'disappointing', 'can', 'however', '34', 'get', '34', 'enjoy', 'film', 'regardless', 'however', 'are', 'not', 'likely', 'so', 'easy', 'overlook', 'One', 'thing', 'would', 'likely', 'be', 'even', 'more', 'egregious', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'had', 'changed', 'Cortana', 'voice', 'even', ""n't"", 'play', 'significant', 'role', 'thankfully', 'can', 'report', 'Jen', 'Taylor', 'DOES', 'indeed', 'reprise', 'role.Video', 'High', 'quality', 'well', 'encoded', 'not', 'video', 'issues', 'be', 'seen', 'ca', ""n't"", 'ask', 'better.Audio', 'So', 'here', 'where', 'am', 'little', 'torn', 'audio', 'flawless', 'sound', 'quality', 'presentation', 'Stereo', 'Surround', 'question', 'problem', 'there', 'one', 'issue', 'have', 'however', 'whoever', 'mastered', 'audio', 'made', 'sure', 'was', 'LOUD', 'use', 'Blu', 'Ray', 'player', 'surround', 'sound', 'system', 'religiously', 'know', 'where', 'properly', 'mastered', 'Hollywood', 'Blu', 'Ray/DVD', 'should', 'be', 'receiver', 'have', 'sound', 'good', '-22', '-25', 'range', 'disc', 'however', 'had', 'turn', 'down', '34', 'way', '34', 'down', 'make', 'sound', 'effects', 'comfortable', 'had', 'drop', 'audio', 'down', '-37', 'otherwise', 'bass', 'was', 'rattling', 'teeth', 'rest', 'house', 'like', 'good', 'booming', 'explosions', 'heart', 'pumping', 'gunshots', 'guttural', 'Covenant', 'screams', 'as', 'much', 'next', 'Halo', 'fan', 'man', 'really', 'did', 'part.This', 'however', 'fairly', 'minor', 'gripe', 'told', 'turning', 'volume', 'knob', 'pressing', 'button', 'remote', 'simple', 'enough', 'enough', 'gripe', 'mention', 'it.Extras:3', 'YES', 'THREE', 'commentary', 'tracks', 'worth', 'listen', 'really', 'mean', 'making', 'featurette', 'worth', 'watching', 'as', 'well', 'Extended', 'interview', 'sequences', 'deeper', 'information', 'studentsCorbulo', 'recruitment', 'videoRed', 'vs', 'Blue', 'special', 'think', 'exclusive', 'done', 'just', 'release', 'am', 'not', 'positive', 'None', 'extras', 'own', 'are', 'amazing', 'put', 'together', 'fact', 'could', 'watch', 'episodes', '34', 'free', '34', 'XBox', 'Live', 'really', 'out', 'good', 'set.Over', ""'re"", 'Halo', 'fan', 'can', 'get', 'different', 'voice', 'Master', 'Chief', 'who', 'really', 'only', 'last', '30-45', 'minutes', 'so', 'only', 'reason', 'can', 'see', 'other', 'free', 'version', 'person', 'not', 'wanting', 'lay', 'down', 'cash', 'have', 'view', 'original', 'episode', 'form', 'release', 'took', 'episodes', 'mashed', 'together', 'rearranged', 'pieces', 'ca', ""n't"", 'just', 'view', 'episode', 'way', 'story', 'superior', 'version.Recommended']",Halo 4: Forward Unto Dawn

It is not very often that a game transitions to a movie in such a spectacular fashion but Forward Unto Dawn breaks the mold of all game movies by tying directly into the game universe storyline.

I couldn't wait for them to get out of boot camp, it was so uninteresting,the dialogue was apparently written by a 12 year old, which seems to be the case in most movies like this. The 20 minutes of action is the only good thing about this movie.
