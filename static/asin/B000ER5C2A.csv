In my mind, the soldiers would bark orders, charge the hills, take schrapnal, and as all wars go many would die. Many a brave little, green man remains buried in my old backyard to this day.Such is the case in Wondrous Oblivion. (Don't worry, if you can't remember the title you will be reminded about a dozen times throughout the movie, not a bad thing.) David Wiseman wants to be the worlds greatest cricket player, and if heart were the measure of greatness in such a sport, the movie would be over in 10 seconds. In his spare time he collects hundreds of crackerjack cricket cards, much like baseball cards. One of the nicest touches in the film is how these cards are handled when he is alone with them. The writer of the movie has an understanding of the inner workings of a child's mind.David lives with his jewish family in a predominantly british neighborhood. The neighbors seem to ""tolerate"" the fact that they are jews, and can only be described as nosey, busy bodies. If you are familiar with Anne of Green Gables - Rachel Lynde on steroids.The core of the story is the boys love of the game, and how the black family (The Samuels) that have moved in next door teaches him how to overcome his awkwardness and put his heart where his cricket bat is. Surrounding the core is the racial indifference towards the Samuels and Wisemans. One nice scene occurs when Davids father hears a noise outside and goes to the window to investigate. Subtle and powerful.If there were any complaints about the film, it would have to involve Davids mother and her ever increasing infatuation with Mr Samuels. Though the subject matter is handled tastefully, I think it may be a little much for a pg movie aimed at kids. It may be a little difficult for them to digest, especially one scene. Again though, there is a great lesson learned here and is true to the characters involved. For older children you could take advantage of the situation to teach some morals.There is a lot to be learned from Wondrous Oblivion: Overcoming obstacles, chasing your dream, and the importance of family. Kids have so few movies to chose from, and so little to allow their own imaginations to work (as computer technology does all the work for them now). It's nice to see movies like Wondrous Oblivion and Secondhand Lions come along which teach can deep lessons - if you want them - but at the very least spark the imagination.

Elsner ""Alan Elsner, author""","[2, 2]","David Wiseman, the 13-year-old hero of this sweet coming-of-age story, is obsessed with cricket -- but has no idea how to actually bat, bowl or field. The son of repressed, fearful Holocaust survivors, he is unlucky enough to be growing up in early 1960s London where racism, anti-Semitism and good old British snobbery are never far below the surface.Having grown up with a somewhat similar background in that place and time myself, I can attest that the movie is spot-on in its depiction of British society of that era.David's fortunes change when a Jamaican family moves in next door and proceeds to built a cricket net (the equivalent of a batting cage) in the narrow back garden. David is drawn to the family like a moth to a bright light. He makes friends with the father and eldest daughter who is his own age and they start coaching him in cricket.I won't give away all the plot developments of this movie. Suffice to say that the acting is very good, the characters sympathetic (with the exception of the racist extremists who raise their ugly heads) and you don't need to know anything about cricket to enjoy this movie.It was slightly spoiled for me by an overly sweet ""Disney"" ending in which everything is neatly and happily resolved in a way that rarely happens in real life.

Wondrous Oblivion delivers this and so much more as it goes straight for your heart.  It's a coming of age drama with some very touching moments as two families learn more about themselves than they may  have originally  cared to.  One family, Jews touched by the horrors of the Holocaust face discrimination in their small English town but then must face the darkness of their own prejudice when a black family moves next door.  I was impressed with David's father, Victor,  a man of deep conviction who struggled in silence with threats against  his family while dealing with his own uneasiness and fear of the black family his son is now becoming so attached to.  What I originally interpreted  as stubbornness soon reveals itself as an internal conflict within his own soul.This is a wonderful movie for families and I highly recommend watching it with your children.

977801,AUHG8KSHI529U,B000ER5C2A,Craig Matteson,"[14, 14]","OK, so as an American you don't know anything about Cricket.  That's OK.  What you need to know, the film gives you because it really isn't about the game, it's about families, friendship, and racism.  Set in the 1960s London, but not tied to a specific year, we get to know David Wiseman (played invitingly by Sam Smith) as a boy full of daydreams, a tremendous love for Cricket, and absolutely no ability.  He can't catch, can't throw, can't run, and can't hit.  Of course, this means that his friends at the school he attends (we would call it a private school in America) make fun of him.  David doesn't care because he loves the game so much he is oblivious to the state of his skills.  The coaches finally put him on the team to change the scoreboard (there are lots of runs in Cricket).He lives in a working class neighborhood with its tiny yard, and the row houses mean that the neighbors are all busybodies, too.  Being the only Jewish family in the neighborhood they get treated differently, but coldly polite since it is fewer than 20 years since the end of the World War II and the holocaust.  David's father has a little shop that consumes all of his time and attention.  In one scene, the family is sitting around the table making cushions to sell in the shop.David's mother, Ruth (Emily Woof), is clearly younger than the father and seems almost too pretty to be the wife of a small time shopkeeper.  This becomes an important fact in the story.  She is a person of dreams and emotions.  And while she is devoted to her family and especially her children, the father's obsession with work denies her the emotional fulfillment she clearly needs.A new family is moving in next door to them and somehow the neighborhood makes it the Wiseman's responsibility as to who moves in.  Why, I cannot fathom.  People are crushed when it is a Jamaican (read black) family.  Delroy Lindo plays Dennis with real presence and emotional complexity.  A very friendly man, Dennis has clearly been away from his wife and daughters for a long time.  He begins setting up a practice Cricket net in their small backyard and David is in rapture.  He befriends Dennis and his daughter, Lilian, whom Dennis is teaching to play the game.  Dennis has great skill at the game and is devoted to it and apparently played it quite seriously.The rest of the movie exposes the elements set out here.  David becomes great friends with Judith, but the issue of race is still, sadly, in their friendship.  Dennis gladly teaches David how to play the game and Ruth is grateful to him.  However, the friendship she develops with the more emotionally present man next door leads to a couple of acutely uncomfortable scenes (for those who think the marriage relationship to be sacred) that reveal other important aspects about Dennis and his devotion to his wife and daughters.The neighborhood racists exacerbate the normal tensions that exist when people suppose that race matters in the least (as almost everyone did in the 1960s).  Difficult drifts to worse and a crisis occurs that wakes everyone up to the destructive nature of their bigotry.I found this to be an enjoyable movie.  It can be a good film to discuss with your children, but those two scenes between Ruth and Dennis will require some thought on how to use it with your family and probably makes the film unusable for young children.  However, they might not even catch what is happening between them.It is well acted, has a pretty good story, and as I noted, the fact that you are unlikely to know Cricket here in the U.S. is not important.  It only uses Cricket as a means to tell the story, it isn't really about the game.",4,"A good story about families, friendship, and race that uses Cricket as the connecting point",1174348800,"03 20, 2007",2007,3668,"['OK', 'so', 'American', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'anything', 'Cricket', 'OK.', 'What', 'need', 'know', 'film', 'really', ""n't"", 'game', 'families', 'friendship', 'racism', 'Set', '1960s', 'London', 'not', 'tied', 'specific', 'year', 'get', 'know', 'David', 'Wiseman', 'played', 'invitingly', 'Sam', 'Smith', 'boy', 'full', 'daydreams', 'tremendous', 'love', 'Cricket', 'absolutely', 'ability', 'ca', ""n't"", 'catch', 'ca', ""n't"", 'throw', 'ca', ""n't"", 'run', 'ca', ""n't"", 'hit', 'course', 'friends', 'school', 'would', 'call', 'private', 'school', 'America', 'make', 'fun', 'David', ""n't"", 'care', 'game', 'so', 'much', 'oblivious', 'state', 'skills', 'coaches', 'finally', 'put', 'team', 'change', 'scoreboard', 'are', 'lots', 'runs', 'Cricket', '.He', 'lives', 'working', 'class', 'neighborhood', 'tiny', 'yard', 'row', 'houses', 'mean', 'neighbors', 'are', 'busybodies', 'too', 'Being', 'only', 'Jewish', 'family', 'neighborhood', 'get', 'treated', 'differently', 'coldly', 'polite', 'fewer', '20', 'years', 'end', 'World', 'War', 'II', 'holocaust', 'David', 'father', 'little', 'shop', 'time', 'attention', 'one', 'scene', 'family', 'sitting', 'table', 'making', 'cushions', 'sell', 'shop.David', 'mother', 'Ruth', 'Emily', 'Woof', 'clearly', 'younger', 'father', 'almost', 'too', 'pretty', 'be', 'wife', 'small', 'time', 'shopkeeper', 'important', 'fact', 'story', 'person', 'dreams', 'emotions', 'devoted', 'family', 'especially', 'children', 'father', 'obsession', 'work', 'emotional', 'fulfillment', 'clearly', 'needs.A', 'new', 'family', 'moving', 'next', 'door', 'somehow', 'neighborhood', 'Wiseman', 'responsibility', 'who', 'Why', 'can', 'not', 'fathom', 'People', 'are', 'crushed', 'when', 'Jamaican', 'read', 'black', 'family', 'Delroy', 'Lindo', 'Dennis', 'real', 'presence', 'emotional', 'complexity', 'very', 'friendly', 'man', 'Dennis', 'clearly', 'been', 'away', 'wife', 'daughters', 'long', 'time', 'setting', 'up', 'practice', 'Cricket', 'net', 'small', 'backyard', 'David', 'rapture', 'Dennis', 'daughter', 'Lilian', 'whom', 'Dennis', 'teaching', 'play', 'game', 'Dennis', 'great', 'skill', 'game', 'devoted', 'apparently', 'played', 'quite', 'seriously.The', 'rest', 'movie', 'elements', 'set', 'out', 'here', 'David', 'great', 'friends', 'Judith', 'issue', 'race', 'still', 'sadly', 'friendship', 'Dennis', 'gladly', 'David', 'how', 'play', 'game', 'Ruth', 'grateful', 'However', 'friendship', 'more', 'emotionally', 'present', 'man', 'next', 'door', 'couple', 'acutely', 'uncomfortable', 'scenes', 'who', 'think', 'marriage', 'relationship', 'be', 'sacred', 'reveal', 'other', 'important', 'aspects', 'Dennis', 'devotion', 'wife', 'daughters.The', 'neighborhood', 'racists', 'exacerbate', 'normal', 'tensions', 'exist', 'when', 'people', 'suppose', 'race', 'matters', 'least', 'almost', 'everyone', 'did', '1960s', 'Difficult', 'drifts', 'worse', 'crisis', 'wakes', 'everyone', 'up', 'destructive', 'nature', 'bigotry.I', 'found', 'be', 'enjoyable', 'movie', 'can', 'be', 'good', 'film', 'discuss', 'children', 'two', 'scenes', 'Ruth', 'Dennis', 'will', 'require', 'thought', 'how', 'use', 'family', 'probably', 'film', 'unusable', 'young', 'children', 'However', 'might', 'not', 'even', 'catch', 'what', 'happening', 'them.It', 'well', 'acted', 'pretty', 'good', 'story', 'noted', 'fact', 'are', 'unlikely', 'know', 'Cricket', 'here', 'U.S.', 'not', 'important', 'only', 'Cricket', 'tell', 'story', ""n't"", 'really', 'game']",Wondrous Oblivion [Region 2]
977802,A1U2IMZ2HM6ABF,B000ER5C2A,De witte leeuw.,"[0, 0]","What really makes this film a good one on the subject of racial intolerance, is the setting.  It takes place in London in the early 1960s about the time that the American Rights Movement began.  A Jewish boy who yarns to be a better Cricket player, but is the worst on his school's team longs for the day in which he will excel in the game.  Into his working-class neighbourhood moves a Black family from Jamaica whose father is a former professional Cricket star from that country.  Much to the surprise and delight of the Jewish boy, his new neighbours almost immediately begin constructing a large Cricket batting cage in their adjacent backyard.  The boy immediately appears at the backyard fence clad completely in his white Cricket uniform with bat and ball in hand.  A friendship is instantly established.  But the Christian Caucasian neighbours and the boys own parents disapprove of the boy's new relationship with the Jamaicans and as time goes on, a tragedy brings everyone together.  This is a good movie that depicts relationships and how they all interact with each faction, culminating in an explosive situation.  I think that as Americans we will view this film from our own experiences.  But the film also presents racial intolerance in a perspective Americans can relate to but in a very different way.  For anyone also interested in Cricket as a sport, this is a good film.  But any novice of this sport, who doesn't really know about it, can understand the game and how it is played.

977803,A328S9RN3U5M68,B000ER5C2A,Grady Harp,"[5, 6]","WONDROUS OBLIVION may seem a puzzling title for this film about racism, coming of age, and understanding and acceptance, but if it is meant to tag the feelings with which the viewer is left after the film, the phrase describes it well. Some critics have labeled this a cross between BILLY ELLIOTT and FAR FROM HEAVEN and while that comparison may be a bit too heavy, the films share many things in common. Writer/director Paul Morrison has stirred the pot of nostalgia with all the right ingredients the result is a film that should bring a very large audience to its feet.The time is the 1960s in London in a neighborhood shared by Jews and other faiths. One family in particular, the Wisemans, live comfortably as German immigrants whose elder family members died in Nazi Germany. David Wiseman (Sam Smith) is eleven years old, and preoccupied with cricket, a sport for which he collects souvenir cards and idolizes players yet who has no skills at playing the game, but stays with his passion with the school team as a score keeper. His father Victor (Stanley Townsend) is all business, and his mother Ruth (Emily Woof) is a kind woman who seems to need more attention than her husband offers. Into the house next door moves a family from Jamaica - Dennis (Delroy Lindo), his wife and two daughters are happy people and play Jamaican music while they construct an odd entity in the tiny back yard, a construction that ends up being a cricket court as Dennis and his daughter are devoted cricket players.In no time the shy David introduces himself and shortly becomes invited to join in learning how to play cricket with the warmly loving Dennis and family. David learns the game well enough to become part of the school playing team and with his increased popularity he is honored with a birthday party, a party to which his new friend form cricket lessons next door is not invited. Hurt, she refuses to play with David any more and that fact unveils a series of events that have been in existence progressively since the black family moved into the white neighborhood. David's mother is warmly noticed by Dennis and the two come very close to a love relationship. Finally a tragedy occurs that brings out all of the needs and the prejudices, the feelings and the commitments that serve to change the way each of the families in the now mixed neighborhood view each other. The tragedy becomes a blessing in disguise.The flavor of the 1960s, the importance of familial Judaism, the joy of the Jamaican view of life and the bigotry that can decimate good people are all captured with great finesse by Morrison. The large cast is excellent with Sam Smith and Delroy Lindo giving particularly fine performances. This is a film that will warm the heart, teach us more about things we little understand, and leave us with the hope that Morrison will make more films of this high caliber. Highly recommended.

977805,A33CLVW2K7SL1P,B000ER5C2A,Jonathan Appleseed,"[2, 3]","David Wiseman, a young Jewish boy in 1960s England, is as obsessed with cricket as anyone can be, but he's not any good at it. That he can't hit or catch a ball doesn't seem to have an affect on him. Indeed, as his coach notes, he is in a state of ""wondrous oblivion"" with regard to his skills, and is assigned to score the games.Then the Samuels, a Jamaican family, move in next door and Mr. Samuels uproots the small garden in the backyard and replaces it with a cricket net. David is awed, and one evening - against the express wishes of his parents, who indicate that these are not their type of people - David shows up dressed in full kit. Mr. Samuels, kind man that he is, helps David over the fence and bowls to him. It's as obvious to him as it is to everyone that David is terrible, and thus begins their friendship. Mr. Samuels, his daughter Judy, and David all ""play"" together in the cricket net, and slowly David's skills improve. With David's increasing skills, he announces to the team's coach that he no longer wants to keep score, but that he wants to play, and earns a spot on the team. It's a little difficult to believe that David ramped up his game so quickly. One can tell that the kid isn't terribly athletic, and he struck me as someone who would never benefit from any amount of coaching.David also develops a close friendship with Judy, and they not only play cricket together, but they study together. Their friendship faces a test when David's teammates become his friends, and when his mother throws him a birthday party she invites his whole team but not Judy. By this time, David's mother, Ruth, is on more than friendly terms with the Samuels, and this omission is glaring. During the party itself, one of his teammates comments on the ""nig-nogs"" that live next door (that was a new one).As David's friends are dropped off at his party, Ruth tries to invite the mothers in, but they all decline. Whether this is because the Wiseman's are Jews, or because they live in a different part of town isn't entirely clear, but the Wiseman's own neighbors look down on them for being Jews. This was amazing to me. It was so soon after World War II, England is so close to Germany, I just couldn't believe that such racism existed there. Obviously I'm nave.During David's party, while he is opening presents and cards from his teammates, he sees Judy walking over. He runs to the door, accepts her presents, but doesn't allow her in, saying, ""My friends are over."" The look on Judy's face tells all - she is crushed. Later, when David knocks on her door to play cricket, Judy's mother answers the door and says, ""She doesn't want to play with you today. She doesn't want to play with you any day. Take your bat and go.""Notes are delivered to the Wiseman's demanding that they get rid of the ""darkies"", and the Wiseman's themselves are referred to as ""yids"" in these notes.One would think that there is a tremendous amount of tension building in the film, but there isn't. It's as brimming with emotion as a cup of bitter tea served with a dry scone sans butter. This is unfortunate, for the movie had great potential. One only needs to look at films likeBilly Elliotto see what this movie could have been. David's accomplishment was something to be cheered, but at no time were we ever encouraged - in this reviewers opinion, at least - to cheer.Still, it was hardly as monotonous as another reviewer claimed, and did a good job of resolving all of the issues it brought up: racism, sexual tension, etc. As well, the acting was quite good. Nobody stepped outside of their role, and all character interactions, even some surprising ones, were believable. Of greatest interest to me was how they handled the racism within racism: namely, the Wiseman's initial distrust of the Samuels'.",3,Low-key look at emotionally charged issues,1175558400,"04 3, 2007",2007,3804,"['David', 'Wiseman', 'young', 'Jewish', 'boy', '1960s', 'England', 'obsessed', 'cricket', 'anyone', 'can', 'be', 'not', 'good', 'ca', ""n't"", 'hit', 'catch', 'ball', ""n't"", 'seem', 'have', 'affect', 'Indeed', 'coach', 'notes', 'state', 'wondrous', 'oblivion', 'regard', 'skills', 'assigned', 'score', 'games.Then', 'Samuels', 'Jamaican', 'family', 'move', 'next', 'door', 'Mr.', 'Samuels', 'small', 'garden', 'backyard', 'replaces', 'cricket', 'net', 'David', 'awed', 'one', 'evening', 'express', 'wishes', 'parents', 'who', 'indicate', 'are', 'not', 'type', 'people', 'David', 'up', 'dressed', 'full', 'kit', 'Mr.', 'Samuels', 'kind', 'man', 'David', 'fence', 'bowls', 'as', 'obvious', 'everyone', 'David', 'terrible', 'thus', 'friendship', 'Mr.', 'Samuels', 'daughter', 'Judy', 'David', 'play', 'together', 'cricket', 'net', 'slowly', 'David', 'skills', 'improve', 'David', 'increasing', 'skills', 'team', 'coach', 'no', 'longer', 'keep', 'score', 'play', 'spot', 'team', 'little', 'difficult', 'believe', 'David', 'ramped', 'up', 'game', 'so', 'quickly', 'One', 'can', 'tell', 'kid', ""n't"", 'terribly', 'athletic', 'struck', 'someone', 'who', 'would', 'never', 'benefit', 'amount', 'coaching.David', 'also', 'close', 'friendship', 'Judy', 'not', 'only', 'play', 'cricket', 'together', 'study', 'together', 'friendship', 'test', 'when', 'David', 'teammates', 'become', 'friends', 'when', 'mother', 'birthday', 'party', 'whole', 'team', 'not', 'Judy', 'time', 'David', 'mother', 'Ruth', 'more', 'friendly', 'terms', 'Samuels', 'omission', 'glaring', 'party', 'one', 'teammates', 'comments', 'nig-nogs', 'live', 'next', 'door', 'was', 'new', 'one', 'David', 'friends', 'are', 'dropped', 'off', 'party', 'Ruth', 'invite', 'mothers', 'decline', 'Wiseman', 'are', 'Jews', 'live', 'different', 'part', 'town', ""n't"", 'entirely', 'clear', 'Wiseman', 'own', 'neighbors', 'look', 'down', 'being', 'Jews', 'was', 'amazing', 'was', 'so', 'soon', 'World', 'War', 'II', 'England', 'so', 'close', 'Germany', 'just', 'could', ""n't"", 'believe', 'such', 'racism', 'existed', 'there', 'Obviously', ""'m"", 'nave.During', 'David', 'party', 'opening', 'presents', 'cards', 'teammates', 'Judy', 'walking', 'over', 'door', 'presents', ""n't"", 'allow', 'saying', 'friends', 'are', 'look', 'Judy', 'face', 'crushed', 'Later', 'when', 'David', 'door', 'play', 'cricket', 'Judy', 'mother', 'door', ""n't"", 'want', 'play', 'today', ""n't"", 'want', 'play', 'day', 'Take', 'bat', 'go', 'Notes', 'are', 'delivered', 'Wiseman', 'demanding', 'get', 'rid', 'darkies', 'Wiseman', 'are', 'referred', 'yids', 'notes.One', 'would', 'think', 'tremendous', 'amount', 'tension', 'building', 'film', ""n't"", 'brimming', 'emotion', 'cup', 'bitter', 'tea', 'served', 'dry', 'scone', 'sans', 'butter', 'unfortunate', 'movie', 'had', 'great', 'potential', 'One', 'only', 'look', 'films', 'likeBilly', 'Elliotto', 'see', 'what', 'movie', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'David', 'accomplishment', 'was', 'something', 'be', 'cheered', 'time', 'were', 'ever', 'encouraged', 'reviewers', 'opinion', 'least', 'cheer.Still', 'was', 'hardly', 'as', 'monotonous', 'reviewer', 'claimed', 'did', 'good', 'job', 'resolving', 'issues', 'brought', 'up', 'racism', 'sexual', 'tension', 'etc', 'well', 'acting', 'was', 'quite', 'good', 'Nobody', 'stepped', 'role', 'character', 'interactions', 'even', 'surprising', 'ones', 'were', 'believable', 'greatest', 'interest', 'was', 'how', 'handled', 'racism', 'racism', 'namely', 'Wiseman', 'initial', 'distrust', 'Samuels']",Wondrous Oblivion [Region 2]

We are all different, yet deep within, we are all alike. Powerful proof of this is the relation between the boy in the movie (a white Jewish kid living in a Jewish neighborhood in Britain, some time in the sixties) and the black man living next door (a Jamaican family man who recently moved in). Both share a love for cricket and the sport unites them in the middle of an odd circumstance, where the rest of the neighbors embark on a racist crusade against the newly arrived black family. The boy's family overcomes their initial prejudice and stand up firm for their neighbors and what's right, as they realize how much alike they all are, in spite of the difference in the color of their skins.Though there are a couple of moments that may not be the most appropriate for children under 13, the movie in general is a great lesson in tolerance and friendship for everyone in the family.",4,A movie to feel good about,1174608000,"03 23, 2007",2007,959,"['Wondrous', 'Oblivion', 'movie', 'coming', 'terms', 'differences', 'are', 'different', 'yet', 'deep', 'are', 'alike', 'Powerful', 'proof', 'relation', 'boy', 'movie', 'white', 'Jewish', 'kid', 'living', 'Jewish', 'neighborhood', 'Britain', 'time', 'sixties', 'black', 'man', 'living', 'next', 'door', 'Jamaican', 'family', 'man', 'who', 'recently', 'moved', 'share', 'love', 'cricket', 'sport', 'middle', 'odd', 'circumstance', 'where', 'rest', 'neighbors', 'embark', 'racist', 'crusade', 'newly', 'arrived', 'black', 'family', 'boy', 'family', 'initial', 'prejudice', 'stand', 'up', 'firm', 'neighbors', 'what', 'right', 'realize', 'how', 'much', 'are', 'spite', 'difference', 'color', 'skins.Though', 'are', 'couple', 'moments', 'may', 'not', 'be', 'most', 'appropriate', 'children', '13', 'movie', 'general', 'great', 'lesson', 'tolerance', 'friendship', 'everyone', 'family']",Wondrous Oblivion [Region 2]
977808,A1VA170GUYGTB,B000ER5C2A,Paula L. Craig,"[1, 6]","This film wants to be a warm and fuzzy family movie about friendship, loyalty, and learning to accept people of other races.  It has a few problems going in.  There's a disturbing subplot in which David's mother Ruth attempts to seduce new Jamaican neighbor Dennis, which frankly makes the movie inappropriate for children. The dialogue is difficult to understand, at least for an American, though it's hard to say whether this is due to the accents or the recording. The movie is also very slow-paced and could have done with some editing.A crucial scene is one in which David rejects the daughter of his Jamaican neighbors, telling her she can't come to his birthday party.  She is terribly hurt by this and cuts off their friendship.  I thought this was a little unfair on her part.  The fact is that children of this age prefer to play in gender-segregated groups, and this is found cross-culturally. While it certainly could happen for a close friendship like this to develop between a boy and a girl, conducting such a friendship in front of the boy's male friends would certainly have led to teasing, if not worse.  This would have happened even if the girl had been white.  While being loyal to friends is fine, promoting the idea that gender shouldn't matter in friendship strikes me as silly.The film's central message, that people of other races and customs enrich our lives, has some truth, but in our time it has been taken to an absurd extreme.  Multiculturalism started out innocently enough as a way to avoid genocidal massacres like the Holocaust, and bring peace and harmony to the world.  It hasn't worked out that way.  Immigration by significant numbers of people of alien religion, customs, and ethnicity is extremely disruptive to any country or neighborhood.  Community feeling and trust between neighbors naturally declines when such immigration occurs.  Britain in recent decades has accepted far too many such immigrants, with destructive consequences that are becoming hideously clear. What were these Jamaicans doing in Britain anyway?  Why did they leave Jamaica?  Jamaica faces desperate problems these days, and trying to solve them by exporting some of its population only creates more problems elsewhere.Overall, I would suggest skipping this movie.",2,"Slow-moving, with some disturbing messages",1191715200,"10 7, 2007",2007,2283,"['film', 'be', 'warm', 'fuzzy', 'family', 'movie', 'friendship', 'loyalty', 'learning', 'accept', 'people', 'other', 'races', 'few', 'problems', 'going', 'disturbing', 'subplot', 'David', 'mother', 'Ruth', 'attempts', 'seduce', 'new', 'Jamaican', 'neighbor', 'Dennis', 'frankly', 'movie', 'inappropriate', 'children', 'dialogue', 'difficult', 'understand', 'least', 'American', 'hard', 'say', 'due', 'accents', 'recording', 'movie', 'also', 'very', 'slow-paced', 'could', 'have', 'done', 'editing.A', 'crucial', 'scene', 'one', 'David', 'daughter', 'Jamaican', 'neighbors', 'telling', 'ca', ""n't"", 'come', 'birthday', 'party', 'terribly', 'hurt', 'cuts', 'off', 'friendship', 'thought', 'was', 'little', 'unfair', 'part', 'fact', 'children', 'age', 'prefer', 'play', 'gender-segregated', 'groups', 'found', 'cross-culturally', 'certainly', 'could', 'happen', 'close', 'friendship', 'develop', 'boy', 'girl', 'conducting', 'such', 'friendship', 'front', 'boy', 'male', 'friends', 'would', 'certainly', 'have', 'led', 'teasing', 'not', 'worse', 'would', 'have', 'happened', 'even', 'girl', 'had', 'been', 'white', 'being', 'loyal', 'friends', 'fine', 'promoting', 'idea', 'gender', 'should', ""n't"", 'matter', 'friendship', 'strikes', 'silly.The', 'film', 'central', 'message', 'people', 'other', 'races', 'customs', 'enrich', 'lives', 'truth', 'time', 'been', 'taken', 'absurd', 'extreme', 'Multiculturalism', 'started', 'out', 'innocently', 'enough', 'way', 'avoid', 'genocidal', 'massacres', 'Holocaust', 'bring', 'peace', 'harmony', 'world', ""n't"", 'worked', 'out', 'way', 'Immigration', 'significant', 'numbers', 'people', 'alien', 'religion', 'customs', 'ethnicity', 'extremely', 'disruptive', 'country', 'neighborhood', 'Community', 'feeling', 'trust', 'neighbors', 'naturally', 'declines', 'when', 'such', 'immigration', 'occurs', 'Britain', 'recent', 'decades', 'accepted', 'far', 'too', 'many', 'such', 'immigrants', 'destructive', 'consequences', 'are', 'becoming', 'hideously', 'clear', 'What', 'were', 'Jamaicans', 'doing', 'Britain', 'anyway', 'Why', 'did', 'leave', 'Jamaica', 'Jamaica', 'desperate', 'problems', 'days', 'trying', 'solve', 'exporting', 'population', 'only', 'more', 'problems', 'elsewhere.Overall', 'would', 'suggest', 'skipping', 'movie']",Wondrous Oblivion [Region 2]

Peek,"[2, 8]","'Wondrous Oblivion' is a story that had the potential to be very good; unfortunately it fell far short of what it could have been.On the positive side, the message communicated is quite good.  The story is set in London in the 1960s in a very racially intolerant area.  David Wiseman is a young Jewish boy who is also an immigrant from Germany.  He and his family face bigotry in their daily lives.David is obsessed with the game of cricket.  He has no talent, but a great love for the game.  He has never had anyone to coach him and develop his ability.  Then another family of immigrants moves next door.  They also face discrimination from the neighbors.The father, Dennis Samuels, takes young David under his wing and teaches him a lot about the game of cricket and develops his talents.  This and some other parts show some great human kindness.On the negative side, this film is really boring and amateurish.  It could have even been worse with the plot built around cricket, which is probably the world's most boring sport.  (I once went to a match with some friends in another country and after being bored to tears for about six hours, I found out that they were just getting started on a game that lasts a week or so).  The creator did minimize the damage that cricket could do to the movie by not focusing on it too much.Besides being boring, it was clearly the work of unskilled filmmakers.
