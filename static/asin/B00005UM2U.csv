684427,A2NVI7WKXB0G2R,B00005UM2U,"Alain Blouin ""alblouin""","[22, 23]","When Berlioz chose to compose his last opera after Virgil's Aeneid, one of his goals was to compete with Wagner's then growing project: the now widely famous ""Ring des Nibelungen"". What came out of it is, to me, some of the most powerful and beautiful music ever composed. The strength and beauty of expression in this opera feels equal, if not superior, to that of Verdi's Otello, Strauss' Elektra, or Wagner's greatest works, and feels deeper than either. As Gluck's greatest supporter, Berlioz was the only one who could continue the operatic tradition of French mythological ""lyrical tradedy"". But ""Les Troyens"" is much more than a ""nostalgia attack""; it is the apotheosis of a tradition, as well as a worthy contender against Wagner's system (which Berlioz judged useless and nonsensical). And it contains many moments of such beauty, of Virgilian pathos, that even a life-long wagnerite can appreciate.This can also be explained by Berlioz's tremendous personal involvement and thematical deepness. Its theme bears many similarities to Victor Hugo's ""Les mis&eacute;rables""; except that in this case, the great force that drowns persons in misery is not society, but fate. Not ""fate"" as in ""luck"", but as the unstoppable advancement of humanity. Berlioz, in it, takes the side of all those peoples who have to suffer because of this ""advancement"". In the utter solitude he ended his life (his two wives and his only son being both dead, his music unpopular in Paris, and his best friend Liszt supporting Wagner), Berlioz had all the rights to feel as abandoned as his characters, and you feel it all throughout the work.Regarding the performers, Jessye Norman, as Cassandra, proves very convincing when it comes to portraying the prophetess who is the only one to know of Troy's misfortune, without being able to prevent it. She truly becomes this wretched victim who knows what will happen to her collapsing world when she sings her aria ""Malheureux roi"", or her subsequent, not-so-love duet with her lover Coroebus. However, her French diction leaves a bit to be desired, which may get annoying though not a big hindrance. Still, don't worry about it if your first language is not french, you'll probably only notice her wonderfully lyrical voice.The young Placido Domingo, as Aeneas, is also very believable as the young hero, son of Venus, who has an important mission to complete for the sake of his people. He looks both young and manly, and though he must lower the notes of a few of his interventions, his intense lyricism makes him very convincing, and allows some great musical moments. He gives an overall believable portrayal of the ""pious Aeneas"", burdened with his un-forfeitable mission, especially in his aria ""Inutiles regrets"", stunning in psychological insight; being given it is only then that you can see the man behind the hero. It is the only time where he is left to himself, and we finally fully see through him (for even when he chooses to live his love with Dido, his mission is unable to get off his mind. And Dido feels it, as it is shown in the beautiful love-duet ""Nuit d'ivresse et d'extase"").Tatiana Troyanos, as Dido, seems almost born for the role (just look at her last name!). She is both noble and full of dignity as a queen, and incredibly heart-rending as a rebellious victim of her love. Some other reviewers have said they would have preferred to hear Norman, but Troyanos' acting talents are so perfect, and her depiction of Dido's despair and vain opposition so moving that I don't think Norman could have done better. And, giving two such different characters the same face is nonsense. Troyanos is completely believable, from beginning to end. From the start, Aeneas and Dido knew their love was not made to work. They knew it, but they chose to live their love as much as they could, in open rebellion against the order of things. All of this can be read upon her face, during the final scene.The supporting cast gives, overall, a very good performance. Everyone does his/her best, and it is more than enough to breath life into Berlioz's wonderful score. Levine's conducting makes you feel both the nostalgia and distress of the whole work, and his orchestra envelops it in its epic aura.The staging, rather simple and un-colorful, only partially goes with Berlioz's original idea. The worst thing about it is when the Trojan horse enters Troy at the end of the first act: we only see its head making a circle around the stage. Also, in the middle of the opera, where instead of seeing a mob of peoples receiving golden tools in association with their respective duty, you see three dancers receiving geometric figures. However, this thing about the big crowns another reviewer talked about is grossly exaggerated. Overall, I'd say it is a sufficiently effective and sober production (and a very good staging, if you compare it to what Salzburg made of ""La damnation de Faust"").The sound on the one dvd is NTSC. The subtitles are only in English and the translation is merely functional. It's a bit of a problem if French is your first language (like me), since no one has a perfect diction. Having the libretto with you can come in handy. You can find it on the internet.Overall, though it is not the definitive version, it is the best right now. And, believe me, it's worth your money. As far as I'm concerned, it gives you all you could ask for in an opera. The music is so heart-wrenching that it makes my other opera dvds (which go from ""L'Orfeo"" to ""Le dialogue des Carm&eacute;lites"") almost pale in comparison. Seriously, if catharsis is your thing, if crying is your thing, buy this dvd now. It is a great gift to give yourself, or any opera fan that thinks French opera is mainly about ""Carmen"", ""Faust"" and ""Pelleas et M&eacute;lisande"".",5,The most beautiful french

684428,A2CNQ1JV16GHW2,B00005UM2U,David Cady,"[8, 13]","First off, I have to admit that ""Les Troyens"" is just not a favorite opera of mine.  Despite all the sturm und drang (French translation, please), I just don't find the piece involving.  That said, it's obviously a significant work and worthy of every opera fan's attention.  And this DVD, recorded at the Met in 1983, offers a starry cast, all of whom do themselves proud.  Norman has to be one of the most intense and idiosyncratic sopranos of the past 30 years, and she's riveting here; the sound is glorious, the acting remarkable.  Domingo is hardly less effective, with his bright, clarion sound superbly matched by the mellowness of Troyanos, herself a superb actress.  So why only 2 stars?  Because the production is a disaster.  It's ill-conceived and lumbering, with sets that match the auditorium's garish gold theme to ill effect.  (Can this look really have been considered stylish in the 70s?)  The costumes in particular are a joke; literally, they're laugh inducing.  The identical braids for the female chorus and the Chewbacca boots for the Trojan soldiers may have seemed chic on paper, but when seen on the frumpy, geriatric singers, they're nothing short of ridiculous.  (It may sound as if I'm being unduly harsh, but they have to be seen to be believed.) At one point, poor Mr. Domingo must don an enormous helmet that all but swallows his head -- and you can palpably sense his embarassment and discomfort.  Troyanos' gold lame outfits are equally absurd.  One can only watch in amazement and think that for their fashion sense alone, the Trojans deserved to lose the war.  All this tackiness undermines the entire enterprise, which is a shame, as the sounds that the singers and Levine's orchestra are producing are magnificent.  If you're a die-hard fan or very, very curious, by all means buy this version of ""Les Troyens.""

684430,AV7Z25U0HUGTU,B00005UM2U,N. Gallimore,"[12, 13]","I have to confess that Les Troyens was completely new to me.  Friends and musicologists have continued to tell me what a magnificent masterpiece it is, oh the lectures I have had by A'level music students at school when I have failed to mention it in my lecture on the History of Opera as an art form, but until now I have never had the opportunity to see or hear it.  So we were very excited when it arrived, and in general we weren't disappointed.It covers a mamouth canvass and with mythology mixed with history it has a tremendous story.  Part I, The Capture of Troy, is just magnificent in every respect of musical structure and dramatic impact.  Jessye Norman is faultless, what an artist.  This section of the opera could stand alone in the fashion of Act I of Die Walkure.  This is an excellent production with an excellent cast.  I disagree with am earlier reviewer, I think Placido Domingo is excellent - although I can see why he never attempted the very demading role of Aeneas again.Part II, The Trogens in Carthage, I feel sometimes looses it's way and dare I suggest perhaps could have been trimmed and tightened up.  The ballet sequences, so essential in French Grand Opera, are too numerous and too long and I think unnecessary.  The plot rambles a bit too, as does the music.  Boito and Verdi proved that an absolute masterpiece can evolve from editing and pruning, look only to Simon Boccagnegra, so I don't think I am being too outrageous here.Tatiana Troyanos as Dido is not in the same league as Jessye Norman and Domingo, but she is good none the less.  Aeneas's decision to leave is fraught with emotion and deserves the ovation, and Dido's sacrifice is very moving.This is a very good release, and an excellent introduction to people like myself, unfamiliar with the work.  I highly recommend it.  When it arrives, pour your self some wine, put on your surround sound and immerse yourself in this tragic and moving tale.  It was a fitting tribute to the Met in it's Centennial Year, and has proved to be a very satisfying release.  I do not hesitate to recommend it to you.",5,A magnificent opera,1019001600,"04 17, 2002",2002,2098,"['have', 'confess', 'Les', 'Troyens', 'was', 'completely', 'new', 'Friends', 'musicologists', 'have', 'continued', 'tell', 'what', 'magnificent', 'masterpiece', 'lectures', 'have', 'had', ""A'level"", 'music', 'students', 'school', 'when', 'have', 'failed', 'mention', 'lecture', 'History', 'Opera', 'art', 'form', 'now', 'have', 'never', 'had', 'opportunity', 'see', 'hear', 'were', 'very', 'excited', 'when', 'arrived', 'general', 'were', ""n't"", 'disappointed.It', 'covers', 'mamouth', 'canvass', 'mythology', 'mixed', 'history', 'tremendous', 'story', 'Part', 'Capture', 'Troy', 'just', 'magnificent', 'respect', 'musical', 'structure', 'dramatic', 'impact', 'Jessye', 'Norman', 'faultless', 'what', 'artist', 'section', 'opera', 'could', 'stand', 'alone', 'fashion', 'Act', 'Die', 'Walkure', 'excellent', 'production', 'excellent', 'cast', 'disagree', 'am', 'earlier', 'reviewer', 'think', 'Placido', 'Domingo', 'excellent', 'can', 'see', 'why', 'never', 'attempted', 'very', 'demading', 'role', 'Aeneas', 'again.Part', 'II', 'Trogens', 'Carthage', 'feel', 'sometimes', 'way', 'dare', 'suggest', 'perhaps', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'trimmed', 'tightened', 'up', 'ballet', 'sequences', 'so', 'essential', 'French', 'Grand', 'Opera', 'are', 'too', 'numerous', 'too', 'long', 'think', 'unnecessary', 'plot', 'bit', 'too', 'music', 'Boito', 'Verdi', 'proved', 'absolute', 'masterpiece', 'can', 'evolve', 'editing', 'pruning', 'look', 'only', 'Simon', 'Boccagnegra', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'am', 'being', 'too', 'outrageous', 'here.Tatiana', 'Troyanos', 'Dido', 'not', 'same', 'league', 'Jessye', 'Norman', 'Domingo', 'good', 'none', 'less', 'Aeneas', 'decision', 'leave', 'fraught', 'emotion', 'ovation', 'Dido', 'sacrifice', 'very', 'moving.This', 'very', 'good', 'release', 'excellent', 'introduction', 'people', 'unfamiliar', 'work', 'highly', 'recommend', 'When', 'pour', 'wine', 'put', 'surround', 'sound', 'immerse', 'tragic', 'moving', 'tale', 'was', 'fitting', 'tribute', 'Met', 'Centennial', 'Year', 'proved', 'be', 'very', 'satisfying', 'release', 'do', 'not', 'hesitate', 'recommend']",N/A

Domingo makes for a strong, masculine Aeneas, and although he had some doubts about singing the part, does a fine job with it.  Troyanos is good, but not as blisteringly magnificent as Norman.  I do have some problems with the staging, however.  Right from the beginning, which should burst at the seems with wild excitement, we get the Trojans walking out, lining up, and declaiming that they are generally pleased the war is over.
