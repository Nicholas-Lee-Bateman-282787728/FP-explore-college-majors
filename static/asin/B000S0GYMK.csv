1084687,A32GCOTGFJ9XC3,B000S0GYMK,"Alex Honda ""onyx575""","[10, 12]","I bought the HAUNTED HISTORIES COLLECTION DVD set because it was on sale here on Amazon. I love the History Channel and since it was October, I figured I'd add this set to my DVD library.With the exception of ""Vampire Secrets"" (with a printed running time of 100-minutes but more like 90-minutes) all of the episodes are under one-hour. The five shows are in plastic clamshell cases and come in a larger cardboard cover box, like in the photo.Even though I enjoyed the shows, I would only advise buying this set when it's on sale. Most of the episodes were produced in 1997 and don't have the fancy digital gadgets featured in most of the paranormal shows on television today, so the shows ""Hauntings"" and ""Poltergeist"" seem a little dated.""Vampire Secrets"" was pretty cool and, if the copyright date on the back of the cover is correct, is the most recently produced show of the bunch. Even though it covers the history of vampires and the romantic idolization of the fabled blood-sucker, it was created much too early to cover the new vampire craze with younger girls and boys--like with the ""Twilight"" books and movie, and in anime.""The Haunted History Of Halloween"" was the show I enjoyed the most because there was great footage of Halloween parades and ""trick or treaters"" from yesteryear. There was also press footage of celebrity Halloween parties and you get to see children of the stars, like Liza Minnelli and Candace Bergen when they were kids. It also talks about how Halloween came about throughout the years.Get it when it's on sale!",4,*Fun* Set But Buy Only On Sale...,1257120000,"11 2, 2009",2009,1548,"['bought', 'HAUNTED', 'HISTORIES', 'COLLECTION', 'DVD', 'set', 'was', 'sale', 'here', 'Amazon', 'love', 'History', 'Channel', 'was', 'October', 'figured', ""'d"", 'add', 'set', 'DVD', 'exception', 'Vampire', 'Secrets', 'printed', 'running', 'time', '100-minutes', 'more', '90-minutes', 'episodes', 'are', 'one-hour', 'five', 'shows', 'are', 'plastic', 'clamshell', 'cases', 'come', 'larger', 'cardboard', 'cover', 'box', 'photo.Even', 'enjoyed', 'shows', 'would', 'only', 'advise', 'buying', 'set', 'when', 'sale', 'Most', 'episodes', 'were', 'produced', '1997', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'fancy', 'digital', 'gadgets', 'featured', 'most', 'paranormal', 'television', 'today', 'shows', 'Hauntings', 'Poltergeist', 'seem', 'little', 'dated', 'Vampire', 'Secrets', 'was', 'pretty', 'cool', 'copyright', 'date', 'back', 'cover', 'correct', 'most', 'recently', 'produced', 'show', 'bunch', 'Even', 'history', 'vampires', 'romantic', 'idolization', 'fabled', 'blood-sucker', 'was', 'created', 'much', 'too', 'early', 'cover', 'new', 'vampire', 'craze', 'younger', 'girls', 'boys', 'Twilight', 'books', 'movie', 'anime', 'Haunted', 'History', 'Halloween', 'was', 'show', 'enjoyed', 'most', 'was', 'great', 'footage', 'Halloween', 'parades', 'trick', 'treaters', 'yesteryear', 'was', 'also', 'press', 'footage', 'celebrity', 'Halloween', 'parties', 'get', 'see', 'children', 'stars', 'Liza', 'Minnelli', 'Candace', 'Bergen', 'when', 'were', 'kids', 'also', 'how', 'Halloween', 'came', 'about', 'years.Get', 'when', 'sale']",Haunted Histories Collection: (Hauntings / Vampire Secrets / Salem Witch Trials / The Haunted History of Halloween / Poltergeist)

However, like most biographies it starts strong and the ending is rushed along. This could have been extended to an hour and half or maybe two hours. Hauntings was a very good dvd in the vein of A Haunting on Disovery Channel or Unsolved Mysterys.I enjoyed this program alot. Poltergeist contains a story that was on Discovery Channel's A Haunting. I cannot recall to much about the program. I've yet to watch Salem Witch Trails but i'm sure it's just as good. Each program is at least 45 minutes.Vampire Secrets didnt really interest me at all, it's longer then the other four programs and runs an hour and twenty minutes. I did like the beginning but when it started talking moderen vampires I got bored and chuckled at the idea.Overall, a very well done setand i'll be looking foward to purchase the other in the Haunted History series.",4,Haunted History,1262044800,"12 29, 2009",2009,980,"['History', 'A', 'E', 'presents', 'come', 'great', 'tales', 'dvd.The', 'Haunted', 'History', 'Halloween', 'started', 'rich', 'detailed', 'history', 'Halloween', 'However', 'most', 'biographies', 'strong', 'ending', 'rushed', 'along', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'extended', 'hour', 'half', 'maybe', 'two', 'hours', 'Hauntings', 'was', 'very', 'good', 'dvd', 'vein', 'A', 'Haunting', 'Disovery', 'Channel', 'Unsolved', 'Mysterys.I', 'enjoyed', 'program', 'alot', 'Poltergeist', 'story', 'was', 'Discovery', 'Channel', 'A', 'Haunting', 'can', 'not', 'recall', 'much', 'program', ""'ve"", 'yet', 'watch', 'Salem', 'Witch', 'Trails', 'i', ""'m"", 'sure', 'just', 'as', 'good', 'program', 'least', '45', 'minutes.Vampire', 'Secrets', 'didnt', 'really', 'interest', 'longer', 'then', 'other', 'four', 'programs', 'hour', 'twenty', 'minutes', 'did', 'beginning', 'when', 'started', 'talking', 'moderen', 'vampires', 'got', 'bored', 'chuckled', 'idea.Overall', 'very', 'well', 'done', 'setand', 'i', ""'ll"", 'be', 'looking', 'foward', 'purchase', 'other', 'Haunted', 'History', 'series']",Haunted Histories Collection: (Hauntings / Vampire Secrets / Salem Witch Trials / The Haunted History of Halloween / Poltergeist)
