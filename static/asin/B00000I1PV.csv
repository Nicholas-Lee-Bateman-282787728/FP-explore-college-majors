At first, it seemed like the marching and the limited space needed would not do my any good, but there are so many variations during the workout, I found my heart rate moving from high to low several times. Overall, the video is a keeper for several reasons: 1) On days where I don't feel like doing anything, I can do a simple workout that will challenge me; 2) It's a much-needed variation to my usual step aerobics - I would consider it an interval challenge since my heart rate range does fluctuate a bit; 3) Gilad is annoying yet funny at the same time, which is a nice change to see a bit more personality in an exercise video 4) There is a flub toward the end and they actually kept it in; at first, I was surprised they wouldn't edit it out, but it actually works in this video, meaning that it keeps things light; a lot of exercise videos out there have that ""fake"" feel to them 'cause they're trying so hard to make the workout look perfect.",5,Simple yet effective workout for all fitness levels,1037836800,"11 21, 2002",2002,1197,"['someone', 'who', 'been', 'working', 'out', 'w/videos', 'almost', '6', 'years', 'heart', 'monitor', 'workout', 'tough', 'find', 'floor', 'aerobics', 'video', 'actually', 'heart', 'rate', 'higher', 'end', 'target', 'range', 'first', 'seemed', 'marching', 'limited', 'space', 'needed', 'would', 'not', 'do', 'good', 'are', 'so', 'many', 'variations', 'workout', 'found', 'heart', 'rate', 'moving', 'high', 'low', 'several', 'times', 'Overall', 'video', 'keeper', 'several', 'reasons', '1', 'days', 'where', 'do', ""n't"", 'feel', 'doing', 'anything', 'can', 'do', 'simple', 'workout', 'will', 'challenge', '2', 'much-needed', 'variation', 'usual', 'step', 'aerobics', 'would', 'consider', 'interval', 'challenge', 'heart', 'rate', 'range', 'fluctuate', 'bit', '3', 'Gilad', 'annoying', 'yet', 'funny', 'same', 'time', 'nice', 'change', 'see', 'bit', 'more', 'personality', 'exercise', 'video', '4', 'flub', 'end', 'actually', 'kept', 'first', 'was', 'surprised', 'would', ""n't"", 'edit', 'out', 'actually', 'video', 'meaning', 'things', 'light', 'lot', 'exercise', 'videos', 'there', 'have', 'fake', 'feel', ""'re"", 'trying', 'so', 'hard', 'make', 'workout', 'look', 'perfect']",Gilad's Fat Burning Workout VHS

Gilad is a great instructor, helps you maintain form, gives suggestions for beginners, and does not have that &quot;cheerleader&quot; attitude that can get downright insulting 20 minutes into an aerobic video.  This is actually fun!  Don't get me wrong, you will sweat, you will breath heavy - this is work.  But, there is nothing terribly complicated.  This is not a dancy workout. Very staightforward, pulse-raising aerobic activity.  A couple of his assitants are aggravating, but not enough so to make me put this tape away.",5,a tough but fun workout!,980467200,"01 26, 2001",2001,568,"['What', 'great', 'addition', 'collection', 'Gilad', 'great', 'instructor', 'maintain', 'form', 'suggestions', 'beginners', 'not', 'have', 'quot', 'cheerleader', 'quot', 'can', 'get', 'downright', 'insulting', '20', 'minutes', 'aerobic', 'video', 'actually', 'fun', 'Do', ""n't"", 'get', 'wrong', 'will', 'sweat', 'will', 'breath', 'heavy', 'work', 'nothing', 'terribly', 'complicated', 'not', 'dancy', 'workout', 'Very', 'staightforward', 'pulse-raising', 'aerobic', 'activity', 'couple', 'assitants', 'are', 'aggravating', 'not', 'enough', 'so', 'make', 'put', 'tape', 'away']",Gilad's Fat Burning Workout VHS
501977,A3869CQLA4D5FP,B00000I1PV,"J. England ""jazzy9230""","[7, 7]","The winning formula present in this and other Gilad videos is uncomplicated, no-nonsense moves that get your heart pumping and increase your fitness level over time. What I like about this video in particular is that you really can modify the moves to your level of fitness. For example, I often run in place instead of marching, resulting in more challenging routine with probably twice as much fat burning. I would recommend that for advanced exercisers or those who are bored with the same routine. Gilad is a great coach, constantly motivating you to keep up your energy. This video is not as strenuous as &quot;Best of Bodies in Motion&quot;, but it's great for when you're short on time and ready to sweat!",5,Can't go wrong with Gilad,1020038400,"04 29, 2002",2002,712,"['winning', 'formula', 'present', 'other', 'Gilad', 'videos', 'uncomplicated', 'no-nonsense', 'moves', 'get', 'heart', 'pumping', 'increase', 'fitness', 'level', 'time', 'What', 'like', 'video', 'particular', 'really', 'can', 'modify', 'moves', 'level', 'fitness', 'example', 'often', 'run', 'place', 'instead', 'marching', 'resulting', 'more', 'challenging', 'routine', 'probably', 'twice', 'as', 'much', 'fat', 'burning', 'would', 'recommend', 'advanced', 'exercisers', 'who', 'are', 'bored', 'same', 'routine', 'Gilad', 'great', 'coach', 'constantly', 'motivating', 'keep', 'up', 'energy', 'video', 'not', 'as', 'strenuous', 'quot', 'Best', 'Bodies', 'Motion', 'quot', 'great', 'when', ""'re"", 'short', 'time', 'ready', 'sweat']",Gilad's Fat Burning Workout VHS

BUT...after doing the workout three times (I always give things a second and third try before finalizing my opinion)...I would definitely have to say that I am disappointed.The workout is extremely repetitive and I found myself getting bored on the first time through.  I am fairly new to exercising and was disappointed to find that this workout didn't keep my heartrate up unless I made the movements more high impact than the tape suggested.  I also found the workout to be difficult on my ankles (I have never had a problem like that with any other tape or fitness program I have tried).The only reason that I gave this two stars instead of one is that it did get my heart rate up when I modified the routine.  It may also be good for serious beginners or people that do not want ANY interesting choreography at all.If you are thinking about getting this tape, get Taebo Live instead.  It has a similar format, but it is much more entertaining and you get a much better workout!",2,Please don't waste your money on this video!,1028851200,"08 9, 2002",2002,1060,"['bought', 'video', 'glowing', 'recommendations', 'read', 'here', 'BUT', 'doing', 'workout', 'three', 'times', 'always', 'give', 'things', 'second', 'third', 'try', 'finalizing', 'opinion', 'would', 'definitely', 'have', 'say', 'am', 'disappointed.The', 'workout', 'extremely', 'repetitive', 'found', 'getting', 'bored', 'first', 'time', 'am', 'fairly', 'new', 'exercising', 'was', 'disappointed', 'find', 'workout', 'did', ""n't"", 'keep', 'heartrate', 'made', 'movements', 'more', 'high', 'impact', 'tape', 'suggested', 'also', 'found', 'workout', 'be', 'difficult', 'ankles', 'have', 'never', 'had', 'problem', 'other', 'tape', 'fitness', 'program', 'have', 'tried', 'only', 'reason', 'gave', 'two', 'stars', 'instead', 'one', 'did', 'get', 'heart', 'rate', 'when', 'modified', 'routine', 'may', 'also', 'be', 'good', 'serious', 'beginners', 'people', 'do', 'not', 'want', 'ANY', 'interesting', 'choreography', 'all.If', 'are', 'thinking', 'getting', 'tape', 'get', 'Taebo', 'Live', 'instead', 'similar', 'format', 'much', 'more', 'entertaining', 'get', 'much', 'better', 'workout']",Gilad's Fat Burning Workout VHS

This is not a dance video, or a boxing video this is an aerobics video. The soundtrack is  decent and he stayed away from current songs so it does not feel dated. He  is motivating without being annoying the workout is fun. Although this is  not a workout for a beginner one can modify it and work up to its level.",5,Great Video,964483200,"07 25, 2000",2000,445,"['great', 'easy', 'use', 'easy', 'learn', 'video', 'Gilad', 'upper', 'lower', 'body', 'pure', 'old', 'school', 'aerobics', 'not', 'dance', 'video', 'boxing', 'video', 'aerobics', 'video', 'soundtrack', 'decent', 'stayed', 'away', 'current', 'songs', 'not', 'feel', 'dated', 'motivating', 'being', 'annoying', 'workout', 'fun', 'not', 'workout', 'beginner', 'one', 'can', 'modify', 'work', 'up', 'level']",Gilad's Fat Burning Workout VHS
501980,A37FZFTQDJ7CZ0,B00000I1PV,"""vegangirl""","[83, 83]","I like this workout because it is pretty simple.  Don't get me wrong--it's not a beginner's routine--it gets my heart rate up every time. (Although, it can be modified for beginners...Gilad suggests using little or no arm movements, and/or marching in place when tired, etc.). But it is not dancey, not complicated--just straightforward fat-burning.  Gilad starts you out with a 7 minute warmup, and then moves into 30 minutes of high and low impact aerobics. Finally, there is a 5 minute cool-down with some stretching.  The music is actually pretty good, and doesn't really seem dated. The moves are really easy to follow, there aren't a lot of fast-paced changes (although the workout is fairly fast-paced at times), and he doesn't add on and go &quot;from the top.&quot;  If you like straightforward stuff, this video is for you. Gilad himself is motivating and he has this great accent. He likes to say things in a regimented voice, as in &quot;and-just-8-more-times&quot; but he says it in such a way that it is charming and makes me laugh out loud almost every time. I really like this video--it is one of my favorites.",5,Easy to follow and fun,970444800,"10 2, 2000",2000,1126,"['like', 'workout', 'pretty', 'simple', 'Do', ""n't"", 'get', 'wrong', 'not', 'beginner', 'routine', 'heart', 'rate', 'time', 'can', 'be', 'modified', 'beginners', 'Gilad', 'using', 'little', 'arm', 'movements', 'and/or', 'marching', 'place', 'when', 'tired', 'etc.', 'not', 'dancey', 'not', 'complicated', 'just', 'straightforward', 'fat-burning', 'Gilad', 'out', '7', 'minute', 'warmup', 'then', '30', 'minutes', 'high', 'low', 'impact', 'aerobics', 'Finally', '5', 'minute', 'cool-down', 'stretching', 'music', 'actually', 'pretty', 'good', ""n't"", 'really', 'seem', 'dated', 'moves', 'are', 'really', 'easy', 'follow', 'are', ""n't"", 'lot', 'fast-paced', 'changes', 'workout', 'fairly', 'fast-paced', 'times', ""n't"", 'add', 'go', 'quot', 'top.', 'quot', 'like', 'straightforward', 'stuff', 'video', 'Gilad', 'motivating', 'great', 'accent', 'say', 'things', 'regimented', 'voice', 'quot', 'and-just-8-more-times', 'quot', 'way', 'charming', 'out', 'loud', 'almost', 'time', 'really', 'video', 'one', 'favorites']",Gilad's Fat Burning Workout VHS
