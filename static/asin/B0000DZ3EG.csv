It's a story of love and of priorities when a disenchanted band member studying law, Lemuel Siddons, decides to get back to the basics in rural America.  In the process he finds love and provides a sterling example to the  town's boys.This film also includes terrific performances by some Hollywood's who's who including the great Fred MacMurray (MY THREE SONS) as Lemuel Siddons, the would-be lawyer who settles for shopkeeping and leading the local scout troop, Vera Miles (THE SEARCHERS) as Vida Downey, the bank secretary who supports Siddons, falls in love with him and ultimately becomes his wife, Kurt Russell (MIRACLE) in one of his first films as Whitey, the tough who is adopted by Lem and Vida and becomes a boy-leader in the troop and finally a soldier and doctor. Look for a cameo by a bona fide screen legend, Lillian Gish as one of the town's business leaders Hetty Seibert.Whether you've been a scout, know one or have had nothing to do with scouting FOLLOW ME, BOYS!

However, if you are looking to show young boys a movie about scouting, this is more than a movie about Scouting.This story is about a man who plays in a traveling band. The band stops in a town, the man sees a girl and he's in love. So he quits the band, gets a job and tries to make a place in the community for himself and woo the girl of his dreams. One of the things he does is volunteer to lead a troop of Scouts.Eventually he does get the woman and he continues to lead the troop of Scouts during the rest of his life. During the course of this movie he learns he can't have children, meets a young man with an alcoholic father, and then he ends up adopting that boy when the father dies.

779795,A3N8RZSXKN1OR2,B0000DZ3EG,Chrijeff,"[30, 32]","This nostalgic tale is one of my favorite Disney live-action offerings.  It begins in 1930, when Lem Siddons (Fred MacMurray), ""out of South Chicago"" and a veteran of the battlefields of France, is travelling with a low-end jazz dance band, Melody Murphy's Collegians (""We're not collegians any more,"" he observes wryly), that takes a pit stop in Hickory, a classic small town probably somewhere in southern Illinois (they hope to get Chicago before night, and there's a ""Clark County"" right next door).  Lem has been nicknamed ""Counsellor"" by his bandmates for the set of law books in his luggage and the correspondence legal course he's always studying; now in his 30's (MacMurray was 58 when he made the film but doesn't look it), he's beginning to feel a need of ""roots.""  When he spots Vida Downey (Vera Miles), secretary and sometime girlfriend of bank president Ralph Hastings (Elliot Reed), and has his attention called to a ""clerk wanted"" sign at John Hughes's (Charlie Ruggles) mercantile, he decides Hickory is the place to put them down.  Within a few weeks, partly in hopes of impressing Vida, he volunteers to serve as scoutmaster if Hickory will form a Boy Scout troop.  Starting out with 15 boys in very much improvised kit, he reaches out (as he was once reached out to) to the town's ""tough kid,"" Whitey (Kurt Russell), whose father (Sean McClory), once a respected plumber, has fallen into drink since the death of his wife, and when Ed's heart gives out from all the bootleg whiskey he's consumed, Lem and Vida, by now married but aware they can't have children of their own, take his son in.  Through a crisis of leadership brought on by Whitey's appointment as patrol leader, an opportunity to shine in court when the troop's patron, town grand dame Hetty Seibert (Lillian Gish), fights nephew Ralph's attempt to have her declared mentally incompetent, and a delightful interlude in which his 1944 troop gets inadvertantly caught in the middle of a wargaming exercise and ends up capturing a tank, he finds not only the roots he sought but rich fulfillment and--without seeking it--a role as a town hero.  When overwork forces him to retire from scoutmastering, he learns just how much Hickory has come to love him and how much influence he has really had (one of his original boys, Hoodoo, has become Governor of the State, while Whitey, after a stint in the Army Medical Corps, is now a town doctor, and Leo an attorney).Lem's character shows us just how possible it is for even an ordinary American to make a difference, and its image of contented, self-sufficient small town life (including some of its warts, as when Mrs. Seibert declares, ""Gossip!  That's all anybody does around here--gossip!""), while perhaps a bit idealized, gives a strong sense of the kind of environment in which Disney himself must have grown up, and which didn't really begin to change until the booming economy and the Interstate Highway construction of the 1950's.  I personally think the movie would have been better if it had been extended to 1960 (which would certainly have been possible) rather than ending 10 years earlier, but it's definitely highly enjoyable even as it stands, and the closing act, when Hickory proclaims Lem Siddons Day and honors its home-town hero, can bring tears to your eyes.  The title (the original source was ""God and My Country,"" a slender novel by ""Andersonville"" author MacKinlay Kantor) comes from the jaunty marching song, formerly sung by ""our outfit over in France,"" that Lem adopts for his first troop.

The actors, technicians, writer and director all deserve better, to say nothing of Walt himself, who happened to produce the darn thing and would have loved widescreen format.  Let's face it:  there's a reason all of today's top directors--Eastwood, Scorsese, Spielberg, Allen, Stone, Lucas, Jackson,etc.--insist on widescreen transfers of their films.  It's the only format that truly respects their work as filmmakers.I bought this DVD in spite of the format because I love the film so much but I'm sorry I did.

The bus makes a brief stop in a small town called Hickory, a charming middle-America kind of place, and Lem makes a fateful decision to stay.  He ends up volunteering to be the Boy Scout leader, impressing the sweet and beautiful Vida in the process.  As a selfless Scout leader he touches the lives of the boys in the town down through the years and influences them for the better, particularly young Kurt Russell.One of my favorite movies of all time, one I like to put on every once in a while when I need a great inspiring kind of movie.  Fred MacMurray plays the role so wonderfully, and I'm reminded of kind Scoutmasters I had when growing up.  But it's not just a great Scout movie, or a great family film, it's just a good entertaining movie to watch.  Some people may call it a sappy and sentimental kind of Disney movie (as though that were something bad), but that's okay with me, I like it that way - and it's a LOT better than the majority of what the entertainment industry (Disney included, unfortunately) turns out now.

779831,A2AOZQ3WTNVVOK,B0000DZ3EG,"Lonnie E. Holder ""The Review's the Thing""","[3, 4]","Lemuel ""Lem"" Siddons, played by the late great Fred McMurray (I grew up watching Fred on ""My Three Sons""; note that this movie was made in 1966 during the original run of ""My Three Sons""), stops in the small town of Hickory and decides that perhaps this is the town for him.  It takes Lem little time to fall in love with local hottie Vida Downy, played by beautiful Vera Miles, who has appeared in more than 150 films.In order to impress Vida, Lem volunteers to be the first scoutmaster in Hickory.  Lem turns out to be the perfect scoutmaster as he is patient, kind and empathetic.  Lem quickly figures out how to motivate the boys and encourage them to be good scouts.  On the other hand, Lem does less well when it comes to his love life, and he manages to stumble a bit with respect to Vida.  Fortunately, for Lem, Vida is nearly as patient and understanding as Lem.Lem is a rookie scoutmaster, but his heart is in the right place and he works hard to become a better scoutmaster.  The next thing you know, several generations of Hickory boys have had Lem as a scoutmaster and Lem is one of the most respected people in town.While Fred McMurray brings a lot to this movie, Lem's boys make the film complete.  The boys get a lot of screen time and show us what it meant to be a boy and a Boy Scout in the 1930's and 1940's.  The boys camp and try hard to be helpful.  Perhaps one of the best aspects of the movie is that it reminds us what scouting was like when scouts went for hikes, camped and built fires.Kurt Russell plays one of Lem's boys, Whitey.  Russell's career was just kicking off.  He had appeared in quite a few television shows, including a title role, but his movie parts had been relatively minor to this point.  In two more years, Disney would give Russell his first starring role in a movie.There are several other noteworthy actors in this movie.  The late Charles ""Charlie"" Ruggles, who gave Lem a job as John Everett Hughes when he first came to town, appeared in dozens of movies and television shows.  The late Lillian Gish, who began her career in silent movies, plays wealthy Hetty Siebert who supports Lem in his efforts for the boys.  A surprise comes further down in the credits with Luana Patten, who was one of Disney's earliest contract players.  Luana was a lead in both ""Song of the South"" and ""So Dear to My Heart.""  An actor who appeared without credit is a very young John Larroquette.Disney movies from the 1960's sometimes received criticism that they were unrealistic in their portrayal of life.  However, this movie does touch on several difficult subjects, including alcoholism.  I applaud Disney for putting these issues before us, even if these issues can be difficult to explain.  Certainly, these issues have not disappeared in the decades since this film first appeared.Noteworthy is that this movie was final Disney produced movie released before Walt Disney's death.The DVD has a couple of extras, but the gem is ""Looking Back with Lem's Boys.""  Several of the members of Lem's scouting troop recall making the movie with McMurray and some of the events that happened during the movie.  This extra is worth watching for some of the details about the making of the movie and about how well the boys got along with McMurray.""Follow Me, Boys!"" has long been one of my favorite Disney movies.  Fred McMurray plays a loveable character who makes a perfect father figure.  Vera Miles is a perfect match for McMurray and keeps pace with him on the screen.  The strong supporting cast is great and has a genuine purpose rather than just being background characters and help make this movie a family gem even for the present generation.  Movies like this one are relatively rare, so you have to have this one if you are a fan of family movies.  Movies about scouting are rarer than good family films, which is yet another reason to have this film.One side note regarding the aspect ratio.  This DVD has an aspect of 1.33:1, or full screen.  As far as I can tell, Disney made this movie in 1966 for theatrical release, which means that its aspect ratio should be bigger than 1.33:1 (I think the first time this movie appeared on television was in 1981).  That means that the DVD version is pan and scan.  I know some reviewers have rated this film low because of pan and scan rather than using the available aspect.  I must admit to a bit of chagrin regarding the aspect ratio, but the movie is good even with full screen aspect so I am sticking with a four-star rating.  I do think Disney missed broader appeal with pan and scan, but I suspect since widescreen is becoming the format of choice, perhaps on the next release we will get everything that is available.Enjoy!",4,Fred McMurray & Scouting in the Early Days,1313971200,"08 22, 2011",2011,4715,"['Lemuel', 'Lem', 'Siddons', 'played', 'late', 'great', 'Fred', 'McMurray', 'grew', 'up', 'watching',

779833,AIY4H4KWR2KWZ,B0000DZ3EG,MadMacs,"[2, 3]","They honestly do not make 'em like this anymore.Part of that is understandable though - the world of open spaces and innocent small towns are long gone, buried under ugly rolling concrete pavers, the internet, ass-fattening video games, embarrassing social media, and a seemingly endless supply of really scary mental cases. Sad.One of my all-time Disney favorites, starring a man that I've come to understand was so much more complex than I could've ever imagined - Fred MacMurray. It took many, many years to come to grips with who he was, not just on screen, but off it as well. But those on-screen moments were oh so special. The man was just about as good as it got when he took on the sweet and funny roles.In this production it's 1930 and Fred plays Lemuel Siddons - Lem for short. A world weary traveler who, through pure happenstance, stumbles into the small town of Hickory. Having spent his entire life on the move, he knows this is the place where he'll put down roots - settle down; maybe find someone special.Turns out that someone is Ms. Vida Downey, played by the beautiful Vera Miles. A loan clerk at the town bank who rebuffs the newcomer as she's already involved with the Vice-President of the bank. But there's a sweetness and a genuine kindness to Lem that she slowly begins to appreciate, and eventually, love.What follows is the passage of twenty years as one man lives a seemingly insignificant existence working as an assistant shop keeper in a small forgettable town. But the critical differences he makes in that tiny, but crucial, role as scout leader to a bunch of young knuckleheads changes everything. Boys that, with the right influence, grow up to be good men and eventually husbands, fathers and contributing citizens. It's not always about money or prestige - and this movie presents the acts of one man who lives a humble but productive life.About as far from an adult movie as one can get and still feature adults in the lead roles. For me, this stands amongst some of the best that Disney produced during it's heyday of live-action films while Walt was still alive.Long a favorite and one that I hope all families, but especially ones with boys, will sit down to watch together. Of course it wasn't always like this, and remembrance has a way of twisting, albeit pleasantly; rounding off the rougher edges of the past. But films like this can and should inspire people, to make an attempt to strive for Lem's kindness, personal sacrifice, and sense of community.A Couple Of Movie Notes:- I was mildly disappointed that the Amazon.com download version presents the cropped pan-n-scan version of this wonderful film. It's not a huge issue, but it does seem silly given the source material can, and ought to, be readily available in the original widescreen presentation.-  Can you imagine Kurt Russell ever being this young? Hard to believe he would have a nearly 60-year career. A true survivor, more so given that he exited the somewhat infamous Disney production mill. Very, very few can make that claim even to this day.

Here is a man that had a dream, that like so many of us, never get to follow through with it.....but he realizes that what he was allowed to do, was even greater.The Story:Lem Siddons is part of a traveling band, but his dream is to settle down and become a lawyer.  He impulsively leaves the band, after a brief meeting with a cute gal in this small town.  So, settling down, he finds a job as a stock boy in the town's general store.  Trying to fit in, he volunteers to become scoutmaster of the newly formed Troop 1.  Becoming more and more involved with the scout troop, he finds his plans to become a lawyer being put on the back burner.  However, the good news is that his initially unsuccessful efforts at romancing the woman he first met, eventually bears fruit.  In time, he becomes the general store's owner, married, and a very loved and respected man in the community.  Still, he holds on to his dream, and with a bit of sadness, that never got to finish a law degree and practice that profession.  In the end, the town turns out to show their love and respect, to acknowledge the difference he made in their lives.

779836,A6GMEO3VRY51S,B0000DZ3EG,microjoe,"[1, 2]","PLOT: The film begins in the 1930's, as Lem Siddons (Fred MacMurray)  decides to stop touring as a jazz musician and settles down in a small town named Hickory.  He goes to work for a local store. After noticing the boys in town seem to get into a lot of mischief because there is nothing to do, Lem offers to start a local Boy Scout troop. He also has time to fall for a local girl, Vida (Vera Miles). The story takes place over several generations of boys that grow up in the Boy Scouts under Lem's leadership, and he gets to see the positive outcome of his part in developing character and values in their lives. A very heartwarming and humorous story, and a favorite with scout leaders to this day.TRIVIA & BEHIND THE SCENES: Directed by Norman Tokar, who also directed other films for the Walt Disney Studios including A Tiger Walks, Savage Sam, The Apple Dumpling Gang, Snowball Express, The Boatniks, The Ugly Dachsund, The Cat from Outer Space, and more. Lead actors Fred MacMurray and Vera Miles both appeared in several Disney movies, and were naturals in this film.  This was young Kurt Russel's first big part for Disney in a feature film. Elliot Reed as the banker, and Charlie Ruggles as the general store owner, you may remember him as the girls grandfather that always has peppermints in his pocket in The Parent Trap.  Filmed in Technicolor. Screenplay by Louis Polletier (who wrote the scripts for Big Red, Those Calloways, Smith!, Bayou Boy), and it was supposed to be based on the book by Mackinlay Kantor, ""God and My Country"". But during the pre-production, the story was completely changed, including many changes by Walt himself. It is said that Walt created the part for Lilian Gish himself. The title song was written by the Sherman Brothers. An LP record was put together as a marketing tie-in to the film, and had songs to sing around the campfire, with the intention of selling the record to summer camps, campgrounds, scouts troops, etc. The small town was built in the back-lot at the Disney studios, and the scenes of camping out were shot at the studios well used Golden Oaks Ranch.There is a whole fleet of wonderful antique cars in the film, 1915 Baker Electric car; 1927 Lincoln Touring Car; 1929 Fords and Chevrolets;  1940, 1946, and 1950 Cadillacs; vintage trucks, a jeep and more. Radio City Music Hall hosted the premier of the film, and it did brisk Christmas box office business.First released on December 1, 1966.  Walt Disney passed away just two weeks later on December 14. Running time 131 minutes. For a special theatrical re-issue of the movie for 1976, it was edited down by 24 minutes to a new length of 107 minutes.  It aired once on the NBC television on the ""Walt Disney's Wonderful World of Color"" weekly show, on August 2 & 16, 1982 as a two episode movie. Released to VHS for the first time in 1984. First DVD release was in 2004. One of the scenes cut from the film that I would love to see restored is when Fred MacMurray and Vera Miles canoe sinks to the bottom of the water. Great family friendly movie, about a regular guy sacrificing for the good of others.",5,BEHIND THE SCENES & TRIVIA,1264032000,"01 21, 2010",2010,3120,"['PLOT', 'film', '1930', 'Lem', 'Siddons', 'Fred', 'MacMurray', 'stop', 'touring', 'jazz', 'musician', 'down', 'small', 'town', 'named', 'Hickory', 'work', 'local', 'store', 'noticing', 'boys', 'town', 'seem', 'get', 'lot', 'mischief', 'nothing', 'do', 'Lem', 'start', 'local', 'Boy', 'Scout', 'troop', 'also', 'time', 'fall', 'local', 'girl', 'Vida', 'Vera', 'Miles', 'story', 'place', 'several', 'generations', 'boys', 'grow', 'up', 'Boy', 'Scouts', 'Lem', 'leadership', 'see', 'positive', 'outcome', 'part', 'developing', 'character', 'values', 'lives', 'very', 'heartwarming', 'humorous', 'story', 'favorite', 'scout', 'leaders', 'day.TRIVIA', 'BEHIND', 'THE', 'SCENES', 'Directed', 'Norman', 'Tokar', 'who', 'also', 'directed', 'other', 'films', 'Walt', 'Disney', 'Studios', 'including', 'A', 'Tiger', 'Walks', 'Savage', 'Sam', 'Apple', 'Dumpling', 'Gang', 'Snowball', 'Express', 'Boatniks', 'Ugly', 'Dachsund', 'Cat', 'Outer', 'Space', 'more', 'Lead', 'actors', 'Fred', 'MacMurray', 'Vera', 'Miles', 'appeared', 'several', 'Disney', 'movies', 'were', 'naturals', 'film', 'was', 'young', 'Kurt', 'Russel', 'first', 'big', 'part', 'Disney', 'feature', 'film', 'Elliot', 'Reed', 'banker', 'Charlie', 'Ruggles', 'general', 'store', 'owner', 'may', 'remember', 'girls', 'grandfather', 'always', 'peppermints', 'pocket', 'Parent', 'Trap', 'Filmed', 'Technicolor', 'Screenplay', 'Louis', 'Polletier', 'who', 'wrote', 'scripts', 'Big', 'Red', 'Calloways', 'Smith', 'Bayou', 'Boy', 'was', 'supposed', 'be', 'based', 'book', 'Mackinlay', 'Kantor', 'God', 'My', 'Country', 'pre-production', 'story', 'was', 'completely', 'changed', 'including', 'many', 'changes', 'Walt', 'said', 'Walt', 'created', 'part', 'Lilian', 'Gish', 'title', 'song', 'was', 'written', 'Sherman', 'Brothers', 'LP', 'record', 'was', 'put', 'together', 'marketing', 'tie-in', 'film', 'had', 'songs', 'sing', 'campfire', 'intention', 'selling', 'record', 'summer', 'camps', 'campgrounds', 'scouts', 'troops', 'etc', 'small', 'town', 'was', 'built', 'back-lot', 'Disney', 'studios', 'scenes', 'camping', 'out', 'were', 'shot', 'studios', 'well', 'used', 'Golden', 'Oaks', 'Ranch.There', 'whole', 'fleet', 'wonderful', 'antique', 'cars', 'film', '1915', 'Baker', 'Electric', 'car', '1927', 'Lincoln', 'Touring', 'Car', '1929', 'Fords', 'Chevrolets', '1940', '1946', '1950', 'Cadillacs', 'vintage', 'trucks', 'jeep', 'more', 'Radio', 'City', 'Music', 'Hall', 'hosted', 'premier', 'film', 'did', 'brisk', 'Christmas', 'box', 'office', 'business.First', 'released', 'December', '1', '1966', 'Walt', 'Disney', 'passed', 'away', 'just', 'two', 'weeks', 'later', 'December', '14', 'Running', 'time', '131', 'minutes', 'special', 'theatrical', 're-issue', 'movie', '1976', 'was', 'edited', 'down', '24', 'minutes', 'new', 'length', '107', 'minutes', 'aired', 'once', 'NBC', 'television', 'Walt', 'Disney', 'Wonderful', 'World', 'Color', 'weekly', 'show', 'August', '2', '16', '1982', 'two', 'episode', 'movie', 'Released', 'VHS', 'first', 'time', '1984', 'First', 'DVD', 'release', 'was', '2004', 'One', 'scenes', 'cut', 'film', 'would', 'love', 'see', 'restored', 'when', 'Fred', 'MacMurray', 'Vera', 'Miles', 'sinks', 'bottom', 'water', 'Great', 'family', 'friendly', 'movie', 'regular', 'guy', 'sacrificing', 'good', 'others']","Follow Me, Boys!"

MacMurray studies law while the bus travels across the country, intending some day to take the bar exam. When the bus pulls into a small Southern town, MacMurray decides to settle down. He applies for a job clerking in a general store. He is attracted to Miles, a bookkeeper at the bank across the street from the store, but she is dating the bank president. At a town meeting, a discussion about the lack of supervision for the young boys in town ensues, and Fred suggests starting a Boy Scouts troop. His suggestion is accepted and he's appointed to be scout leader. A Disney-pleaser, the film also features Lillian Gish, Kurt Russell and Charlie Ruggles. It is a film the whole family will enjoy. Seeing a young Kurt is a treat. Even at a young age, he was a fine actor and it shows in the role of Whitey. Lillian Gish, of silent film fame, made the transition to talkies without a stumble.
