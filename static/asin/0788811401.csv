There is a reason these movies are still available. There is no swearing, no risky behavior, no bloody scenes and no nudity.

Once I realized my mistake I looked into it and it said the product was in ""very good"" condition. The case was partially melted and the disk had smudges all over it!

I rate this film high by the number of loud belly laughs from our kids.This movie is really just a collection of supporting actors handed an entertaining storyline. It is based on a book wherein the action happened in the California Gold Rush days. In this film you see a bad guy in a Confederate kepi hat and it is apparently postwar. The cooley laundrymen might seem a bit stereotypical for some.Rich detailed scenery and backdrops. Great outdoor filming. Some anachronistic costuming? Maybe.

Watching this movie now, it didn't quite hold up as well as I remembered, but it is somewhat entertaining, and I would feel comfortable showing it to my nieces and nephews, given its' lack of anything that could be considered even remotely offensive.The plot has Donovan (Bill Bixby), a bachelor and small time hustler of sorts, getting stuck with the care of three orphan children.  As he tries to unburden himself of his three wards, he finds the townspeople to be less than receptive to the idea of taking in the children.  These orphans hold the deed to a goldmine, thought by everyone to be dried up, but an earthquake turns up a huge gold nugget, and now the townspeople are falling over themselves to take custody.  Donovan, actually concerned with the welfare of the children, works up a plan to marry Dusty (Susan Clark), and pass the children on to her care, as she seems truly interested in the welfare of the children, and not their money.Don Knotts and Tim Conway play a pair of bungling thieves who scheme, among other things, to try and steal the huge gold nugget.  The whole ladder theft from the firehouse scene was pretty funny.Some other easily recognizable stars in this movie are Harry Morgan and Slim Pickens.As I said before, while the movie didn't seem as humorous to me now as it did when I was a child, it was certainly entertaining.  It's a fine wide screen presentation, but what I really enjoyed was the special features.  The interactive menus are excellent and grant access to quite a lot of interesting information like lengthy biographies, interviews, history of the back lots at Disney studios, promotional stills and advertising material for the movie, a synopsis of what was going on at Walt Disney in 1975 (the year this movie was released), and so much more.",4,First they blew into town... then they BLEW IT UP!,1064188800,"09 22, 2003",2003,1878,"['bought', 'movie', 'sense', 'nostalgia', 'being', 'child', 'seventies', 'Watching', 'movie', 'now', 'did', ""n't"", 'quite', 'hold', 'up', 'as', 'well', 'remembered', 'somewhat', 'entertaining', 'would', 'feel', 'comfortable', 'showing', 'nieces', 'nephews', 'given', 'lack', 'anything', 'could', 'be', 'considered', 'even', 'remotely', 'offensive.The', 'plot', 'Donovan', 'Bill', 'Bixby', 'bachelor', 'small', 'time', 'hustler', 'sorts', 'getting', 'stuck', 'care', 'three', 'orphan', 'children', 'unburden', 'three', 'wards', 'townspeople', 'be', 'less', 'receptive', 'idea', 'taking', 'children', 'orphans', 'hold', 'deed', 'goldmine', 'thought', 'everyone', 'be', 'dried', 'up', 'earthquake', 'up', 'huge', 'gold', 'nugget', 'now', 'townspeople', 'are', 'falling', 'take', 'custody', 'Donovan', 'actually', 'concerned', 'welfare', 'children', 'up', 'plan', 'marry', 'Dusty', 'Susan', 'Clark', 'pass', 'children', 'care', 'truly', 'interested', 'welfare', 'children', 'not', 'money.Don', 'Knotts', 'Tim', 'Conway', 'play', 'pair', 'bungling', 'thieves', 'who', 'scheme', 'other', 'things', 'try', 'steal', 'huge', 'gold', 'nugget', 'whole', 'ladder', 'theft', 'firehouse', 'scene', 'was', 'pretty', 'funny.Some', 'other', 'easily', 'recognizable', 'stars', 'movie', 'are', 'Harry', 'Morgan', 'Slim', 'Pickens.As', 'said', 'movie', 'did', ""n't"", 'seem', 'as', 'humorous', 'now', 'did', 'when', 'was', 'child', 'was', 'certainly', 'entertaining', 'fine', 'wide', 'screen', 'presentation', 'what', 'really', 'enjoyed', 'was', 'special', 'features', 'interactive', 'menus', 'are', 'excellent', 'grant', 'access', 'quite', 'lot', 'interesting', 'information', 'lengthy', 'biographies', 'interviews', 'history', 'back', 'lots', 'Disney', 'studios', 'promotional', 'stills', 'advertising', 'material', 'movie', 'synopsis', 'what', 'was', 'going', 'Walt', 'Disney', '1975', 'year', 'movie', 'was', 'released', 'so', 'much', 'more']",N/A

And truthfully a lot of good(not great, but good)live action family films came out of the 1970's.While they play only supporting characters, Tim Conway and Don Knotts steal the show as funny but not so successful outlaws.  The two parts they play Theodore and Amos it seems were specifically created for Knotts and Conway.  In some parts I felt like I was watching Barney Fife's great great grandfather way out west.The other castmembers are well portrayed, I especially liked Harry Morgan and the kids.  Clovis was my favorite child of the three (clovis don't like to be touched).Overall the story is humerous and enjoyable for all ages.  In a time when the live action family film has just about disappeared it's nice to see Disney releasing these movies again.If you liked this movie go ahead and pick up the sequel, it follows the antics of Conway and Knotts again, and while the story is not as good as the original, it is a lot funnier.",4,Dumpling Gang is a  Disney live-action classic,1143590400,"03 29, 2006",2006,1102,"['Apple', 'Dumpling', 'Gang', 'movie', 'Disney', 'made', 'when', 'reason', 'were', 'straying', 'temporarily', 'away', 'animation', 'making', 'more', 'live', 'action', 'movies', 'truthfully', 'lot', 'good', 'not', 'great', 'good', 'live', 'action', 'family', 'films', 'came', ""1970's.While"", 'play', 'only', 'supporting', 'characters', 'Tim', 'Conway', 'Don', 'Knotts', 'steal', 'show', 'funny', 'not', 'so', 'successful', 'outlaws', 'two', 'parts', 'play', 'Theodore', 'Amos', 'were', 'specifically', 'created', 'Knotts', 'Conway', 'parts', 'felt', 'was', 'watching', 'Barney', 'Fife', 'great', 'great', 'grandfather', 'way', 'west.The', 'other', 'castmembers', 'are', 'well', 'portrayed', 'especially', 'liked', 'Harry', 'Morgan', 'kids', 'Clovis', 'was', 'favorite', 'child', 'three', 'clovis', 'do', ""n't"", 'like', 'be', 'touched', 'story', 'humerous', 'enjoyable', 'ages', 'time', 'when', 'live', 'action', 'family', 'film', 'just', 'about', 'disappeared', 'nice', 'see', 'Disney', 'releasing', 'movies', 'again.If', 'liked', 'movie', 'go', 'ahead', 'pick', 'up', 'sequel', 'antics', 'Conway', 'Knotts', 'again', 'story', 'not', 'as', 'good', 'original', 'lot', 'funnier']",N/A

79928,A6GMEO3VRY51S,0788811401,microjoe,"[0, 0]","THE STORY: Set in 1879 small town Quake City, California, it a story about a traveling gambler that obtains an unknown item in a game, a ""valuable"" shipment to arrive by stagecoach. The coach is driven by the woman he falls in love with, Dusty Clydesdale. The shipment turns out to be the unwelcome treasure of 3 orphan kids of a dad who has abandoned them to find his fortune in San Francisco. Dead broke, the gambler struggles to feed the kids. But when the kids find a huge gold nugget, their troubles are over. Except this brings the pursuit of the Hash Knife Outfit, the bumbling crooks played by Knotts and Conway, who can't seem to get anything right. They attempt bank robberies and other crimes in their attempts to get rich quick.BEHIND THE SCENES: Based on a book by Jack Bickham. Directed by Norman Tokar, this film brought together a team of two well known comedians, Don Knotts and Tim Conway, of their day for this 1975 movie. The pair were wonderful together and their slapstick comedy gets some great belly laughs. The movie also featured television star Bill Bixby (of Courtship of Eddie's Father, The Magician, The Hulk, etc), Slim Pickens as a bad guy, Harry Morgan, and Susan Clark. The film was shot at the Disney studio lot and soundstage, as well as on location at the Tropico Gold Mine in Rosamond, California and the Deschutes National Forest in Oregon. The bank robbery scenes were so complex to shoot that they built 3 near identical sets for the bank, one indoors in a Disney soundstage, and two more were built on the back lot at the studio. One was built without a roof and was to be the image of the burnt bank after the explosion.The movie has a strong history with the public, it was aired on the ""Wonderful World of Disney"" television show on November 11, 1976 for the first time, only a year after its theatrical release. It was popular enough to be re-aired twice in 1980, and again in '86, and '89. The movie spawned a sequel with Knotts and Conway called ""The Apple Dumpling Gang Rides Again"" in 1979, as well as a television remake movie ""Tales of the Apple Dumpling Gang"", and a TV series called ""Gun Shy"". First released on VHS in 1980, then again in 1985, & 1992.DVD RELEASE: The DVD version has some nice extras including a seperate audio commentary track with the voices of Susan Clark, Tim Conway, and Don Knotts. Also includes a featurette called ""A Look Back With The Gang"" with Tim Conway; and two Disney cowboy themed cartoons; and a nice featurette on the studio called ""The Disney Back Lot"". Also a 1975 Disney Studio Album showing all the other material in movies, animation, and theme parks that Disney worked on the year of this movies release; A gallery of production stills, biographies, and advertising items related to the movie.

79929,A2QO4P5SGAZYI8,0788811401,Nancy A. Fox,"[1, 1]","Since many other reviewers have discussed the plot, I won't bother describing it here. This is a typical family-friendly Disney movie from the 1970s, but the cast, production values, and direction make this one of the better ones. Bill Bixby is nicely cast as the charming gambler, with a big heart. Susan Clark is convincing as the tough on the outside, but soft on the inside, stagecoach driver. The supporting cast of character actors lead by Harry Morgan, David Wayne, and Slim Pickens are well-used. The children are nicely cast, and come off as real kids, not just Hollywood stereotypes. However, special mention must be made for the DELIGHTFUL pairing of Don Knotts and Tim Conway. Their comedy routines generously spaced throughout the movie are hysterical, and you realize you are watching two wonderfully matched professionals doing what they do best.It's a fun film that can be enjoyed by everyone in the family: it is silly without being gross, it has heart without being too schmaltzy, and when it's finished everyone has a smile on their face. As Susan Clark states in the Look back with the Gang featurette, ""it's charming.""Ah, yes, those extras. Since I am reviewing the Special Edition release (2003) of this movie, I must mention the wonderful extra features. The aforementioned Look Back with the Gang shows current (2003) interviews with most of the surviving cast and crew members. Susan Clark talks about how she got this role, the former child actors are all interviewed and they all have positive things to say about the shoot and their co-stars, and there are wonderful parts with Don Knotts and Tim Conway, especially as they discuss filming the infamous firehouse scene. There is nothing scandalous, just some nice memories of a fun job.There is a fascinating documentary about the Disney studio back lot. You learn about the back lot's evolution over the years, and the many movies that were shot there. Former Disney employees talk about their times on the lot, and how detailed the sets were, etc. A lot of fun, if like me you've seen a number of the films shot there.There are other features that show the advertising done for the movie, biographies of the cast, a cartoon short, etc. However, as far as I am concerned the best part was the interview with Tim Conway. He discusses his career, especially the movies he made for Disney, and looks back fondly, and hysterically at his career. I had to watch it twice because I kept laughing so hard, I missed a lot the first time through. After watching this interview, I realized what a gem Mr. Conway is. He is truly a comic genius who has thoroughly enjoyed making people laugh for a living. As he points out, his humor was never cruel, never made anyone look stupid, and never embarrassed anyone. That's a rare thing for a comedian to say today.So, in closing, if you are looking for a fun film for the entire family you can't go wrong with the Apple Dumpling Gang.

79938,AK61LQI92GTCH,0788811401,"Steven Hellerstedt ""SH""","[22, 25]","Seven ways to tell THE APPLE DUMPLING GANG is a Walt Disney movie.1- The story is set in Quake City, California, and is a western.  The story is about three orphans - nine-year-old Clovis (Brad Savage), thirteen-year-old Bobby (Clay O'Brien), and seven-year-old Celia (Stacy Manning) - who aren't as insufferably cute as you were worried they'd be.2- The movie deals with a classic Disney theme - lost children in search of love and security. The movie throws the athletic Susan George and the charming Bill Bixby in their path.  George plays a stagecoach driver and Bixby a roving gambler who becomes guardian of the children, and who, most of the time, forgets there's a pretty woman `neath George's cowboy clothes and trail dust.  Bixby nearly burns down the cabin when he tries to fix the kids dinner.  There's no way George and Bixby will ever get together, even though the kids need a stable family.3- The scariest moment takes place in an abandoned gold mine.  You know this is a Disney movie because the vermin scuttling about the dark mineshafts aren't bats and rats, but rather the less threatening owls and mice.4- The scariest bad guy is played by Slim Pickens, who does put one of the kids in danger for a little while, but for the most part is an inept outlaw.5- The other bad guys are played by Don Knotts and Tim Conway, dumb and dumber partners who can't seem to do much of anything right.  How dumb are they?  After casing a bank prior to robbing it, Don Knotts tells Tim Conway ""It's a piece of cake!"" to which an agitated Conway responds ""You mean it ain't gold!?""6- You know this is a Disney movie because the sets are richly detailed and look good and realistic.7- Finally, you know this is a Disney movie because you laughed when you were supposed to, rooted for the kids, hoped Bixby and George would finally realize they were meant for each other. In other words you like the movie quite a bit, but this being a Disney and you being a hip adult you don't want to spread that uncool news too far.",4,Apple Dumpling Gang,1112400000,"04 2, 2005",2005,2020,"['Seven', 'ways', 'tell', 'THE', 'APPLE', 'DUMPLING', 'GANG', 'Walt', 'Disney', 'movie.1-', 'story', 'set', 'Quake', 'City', 'California', 'western', 'story', 'three', 'orphans', 'nine-year-old', 'Clovis', 'Brad', 'Savage', 'thirteen-year-old', 'Bobby', 'Clay', ""O'Brien"", 'seven-year-old', 'Celia', 'Stacy', 'Manning', 'who', 'are', ""n't"", 'insufferably', 'cute', 'were', 'worried', ""'d"", 'be.2-', 'movie', 'deals', 'classic', 'Disney', 'theme', 'lost', 'children', 'search', 'love', 'security', 'movie', 'athletic', 'Susan', 'George', 'charming', 'Bill', 'Bixby', 'path', 'George', 'stagecoach', 'driver', 'Bixby', 'roving', 'gambler', 'who', 'guardian', 'children', 'who', 'most', 'time', 'forgets', 'pretty', 'woman', 'neath', 'George', 'cowboy', 'clothes', 'trail', 'dust', 'Bixby', 'nearly', 'down', 'cabin', 'when', 'fix', 'kids', 'dinner', 'way', 'George', 'Bixby', 'will', 'ever', 'get', 'together', 'even', 'kids', 'need', 'stable', 'family.3-', 'scariest', 'moment', 'place', 'abandoned', 'gold', 'mine', 'know', 'Disney', 'movie', 'vermin', 'scuttling', 'dark', 'mineshafts', 'are', ""n't"", 'bats', 'rats', 'rather', 'less', 'threatening', 'owls', 'mice.4-', 'scariest', 'bad', 'guy', 'played', 'Slim', 'Pickens', 'who', 'put', 'one', 'kids', 'danger', 'little', 'while', 'most', 'part', 'inept', 'outlaw.5-', 'other', 'bad', 'guys', 'are', 'played', 'Don', 'Knotts', 'Tim', 'Conway', 'dumb', 'dumber', 'partners', 'who', 'ca', ""n't"", 'seem', 'do', 'much', 'anything', 'right', 'How', 'dumb', 'are', 'casing', 'bank', 'prior', 'robbing', 'Don', 'Knotts', 'Tim', 'Conway', 'piece', 'cake', 'agitated', 'Conway', 'mean', 'ai', ""n't"", 'gold', '6-', 'know', 'Disney', 'movie', 'sets', 'are', 'richly', 'detailed', 'look', 'good', 'realistic.7-', 'Finally', 'know', 'Disney', 'movie', 'laughed', 'when', 'were', 'supposed', 'rooted', 'kids', 'hoped', 'Bixby', 'George', 'would', 'finally', 'realize', 'were', 'meant', 'other', 'other', 'words', 'movie', 'quite', 'bit', 'being', 'Disney', 'being', 'hip', 'adult', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'spread', 'uncool', 'news', 'too', 'far']",N/A
