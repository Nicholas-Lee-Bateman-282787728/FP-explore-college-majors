At first glance you wouldn't think this movie is very entertaining, but it was sweet and quite humorous!  The acting is fairly well done and I just love this movie overall.  Would definitely suggest to any romantic comedy fan, or anyone that loves a bit of dancing for sure.",5,Adorable!,1397692800,"04 17, 2014",2014,397,"['love', 'movie', 'dancing', 'really', 'fun', 'acting', 'somewhat', 'cheesy', 'part', 'charm', 'movie', 'first', 'glance', 'would', ""n't"", 'think', 'movie', 'very', 'entertaining', 'was', 'sweet', 'quite', 'humorous', 'acting', 'fairly', 'well', 'done', 'just', 'love', 'movie', 'overall', 'Would', 'definitely', 'suggest', 'romantic', 'comedy', 'fan', 'anyone', 'bit', 'dancing', 'sure']",Innocent Steps (Region 3 / Non USA Region) (English Subtitled)

This movie really surprised me as it had a very light touch of humour added to the serious story line making it a sweet endearing movie. No the story isn't that unique, but I liked the performances, they seemed believable & I also liked that the characters were likeable. Some Korean movies have the characters crying for alot of the movie...which gets a little old and bogs down the movie. This had the right amount of sadness and gave the viewer a nice ending. The writers were smart & didn't add unnecessary sex into the story, which once again proves that characters in love don't have to have sex or even kiss to show an enjoyable romance.Also, there wasn't alot of foul language(though they do drop a few 'F' bombs).",5,"unlike alot of other Korean movies, in a good way !",1371340800,"06 16, 2013",2013,834,"[""'ve"", 'seen', 'few', 'other', 'Korean', 'movies', 'had', 'alot', 'top', 'slapstick', 'humour', 'made', 'want', 'cringe', 'movie', 'really', 'surprised', 'had', 'very', 'light', 'touch', 'humour', 'added', 'serious', 'story', 'line', 'making', 'sweet', 'endearing', 'movie', 'story', ""n't"", 'unique', 'liked', 'performances', 'seemed', 'believable', 'also', 'liked', 'characters', 'were', 'likeable', 'Korean', 'movies', 'have', 'characters', 'crying', 'alot', 'movie', 'little', 'old', 'down', 'movie', 'had', 'right', 'amount', 'sadness', 'gave', 'viewer', 'nice', 'ending', 'writers', 'were', 'smart', 'did', ""n't"", 'add', 'unnecessary', 'sex', 'story', 'once', 'again', 'characters', 'love', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'have', 'sex', 'even', 'kiss', 'show', 'enjoyable', 'romance.Also', 'was', ""n't"", 'alot', 'foul', 'language', 'do', 'drop', 'few', 'F', 'bombs']",Innocent Steps (Region 3 / Non USA Region) (English Subtitled)

In fact, you end up with a mild endorsement of arranged unions, secondary to fantastic, joyful dance sequences. That said, I was swept into its spell early on once I realized I had come with mistaken beliefs that this was a children's film on the basis of the female lead (Geun-Young Moon) who, at first, appeared to be so young. Two characters, caught up into a political intrigue, facing deportation in conflict with a rival/dancer doesn't sound like a promising storyline, but this charming film builds up a dance relationship that lasts once the leads establish their boundaries. Isn't that so in life? You will be reminded of familiar dance movie themes, Pygmalion, but they all fade quickly with the wonderful acting and child-like poetry that cuts to the heart of us all when uttered by two lovely souls holding out for each other. The stern dance instructor who melts is played courageously by Keon-hueong Park. Great praise to the editor and director who effortlessly makes you forget this yarn spends most of its time struggling on the dance floor or in a studio loft squeezing your heartstrings.

This is almost a duplicate of a movie made in India seen on Ntflx which I can't remember the name of, and for the first few minutes I thought I had already seen it. However, this Korean one adds another &#34;theme&#34; to it which is very pertinent to the story, which I will not &#34;spoil&#34;, and although there is plenty of dance but not nearly as much as the one from India, this film focuses more on the character development and relationship between the 2 leads. Several familiar faces in this film if you've seen a lot of Korean films. Acting of the 2 leads great. A few &#34;F&#34; bombs and some violent actions which weren't included in the Indian version. Just enough humor sprinkled throughout. I'm VERY fussy about rating films, and I thoroughly enjoyed this one, and would even watch it again.
