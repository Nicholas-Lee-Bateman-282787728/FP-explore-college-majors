1041912,AOCDM5AZDBDEJ,B000M11YNO,brian steven ruiz,"[0, 0]","I want to say that this movie is a great movie to see but it makes you feel very sad at the end. I want to say this is a gold crown collector's edition hallmark hall of fame with the cast of alicia silverstone, eion bailey, and Annabeth Gish one woman's hope brought life to an entire town. What this movie has is that it includes the making of &#34;candles on bay street&#34; conversations, about the production, cast & credits, biographies, full screen version, and 5.1 Dolby surround as a spirited eighteen year-old, dee dee (alicia silverstone) thought the world outside her small hometown was magical and she couldn't wait to leave. But for most of the thirteen years she's been away, the pretty single mother has been telling her son trooper stories about the magical town she grew up in. Now they're moving back into the house she's inherited from her mother, where dee dee plans to raise trooper and open a candle shop. This news is unsettling for the young man she left behind all those years ago. Sam timmons (eion bailey) is now a respected veterinarian practicing with his loving wife lydia (annabeth Gish). Dee Dee's presence immediately creates tension between sam and lydia, until a curious thing happens. The three become friends. Despite the inital awkwardness, old wounds are mended and new friendships are formed. As their relationships deepen, dee dee finally reveals the true reason she's come home-a secret that will change their lives forever. The doctors at the beginning of the film tells the girl that comes in to take care of the puppies. The construction workers said you guys are in a hurry. I wouldn't do that. Dee dee says hey kid come help me. She hits him with a broom. The doctors working together in the office said hey what's up. Their working on the animals to heal and to give them for adoption. The boy gets to play the drums before his mom dies. I just want to say when the amazon.com customers buy this movie they will learn from the beginning of the movie to the end, how really sad the movie becomes, and at the end she past away. The boy will be living with another family and she warned him about her death. The making of &#34;candles on bay street&#34; scencic locations near halifax, nova Scotia, were the backdrop for this endearing movie. Visit the sets and learn more about the filiming experience in behind-the-scenes interviews with alicia silverstone, eion bailey, and director john erman. Running time approximately 98 minutes 1 hour 38 minutes.",5,I give this 5 out of 5 stars with a 100% rating. a sad story especially in the end for the boys mother. a heartbreaking tragedy.,1403049600,"06 18, 2014",2014,2499,"['want', 'say', 'movie', 'great', 'movie', 'see', 'feel', 'very', 'sad', 'end', 'want', 'say', 'gold', 'crown', 'collector', 'edition', 'hallmark', 'hall', 'fame', 'cast', 'alicia', 'silverstone', 'eion', 'bailey', 'Annabeth', 'Gish', 'one', 'woman', 'hope', 'brought', 'life', 'entire', 'town', 'What', 'movie', 'making', '34', 'candles', 'bay', 'street', '34', 'conversations', 'production', 'cast', 'credits', 'biographies', 'full', 'screen', 'version', '5.1', 'Dolby', 'surround', 'spirited', 'eighteen', 'year-old', 'dee', 'dee', 'silverstone', 'thought', 'world', 'small', 'hometown', 'was', 'magical', 'could', ""n't"", 'wait', 'leave', 'most', 'thirteen', 'years', 'been', 'away', 'pretty', 'single', 'mother', 'been', 'telling', 'son', 'trooper', 'stories', 'magical', 'town', 'grew', 'up', 'Now', ""'re"", 'moving', 'back', 'house', 'inherited', 'mother', 'where', 'dee', 'dee', 'plans', 'raise', 'trooper', 'open', 'candle', 'shop', 'news', 'unsettling', 'young', 'man', 'left', 'years', 'ago', 'Sam', 'timmons', 'eion', 'bailey', 'now', 'respected', 'veterinarian', 'practicing', 'loving', 'wife', 'lydia', 'annabeth', 'Gish', 'Dee', 'Dee', 'presence', 'immediately', 'tension', 'sam', 'lydia', 'curious', 'thing', 'happens', 'three', 'become', 'friends', 'inital', 'awkwardness', 'old', 'wounds', 'are', 'mended', 'new', 'friendships', 'are', 'formed', 'relationships', 'deepen', 'dee', 'dee', 'finally', 'true', 'reason', 'come', 'home-a', 'secret', 'will', 'change', 'lives', 'forever', 'doctors', 'beginning', 'film', 'girl', 'take', 'care', 'puppies', 'construction', 'workers', 'said', 'guys', 'are', 'hurry', 'would', ""n't"", 'do', 'Dee', 'dee', 'hey', 'kid', 'come', 'help', 'broom', 'doctors', 'working', 'together', 'office', 'said', 'hey', 'what', 'up', 'working', 'animals', 'heal', 'give', 'adoption', 'boy', 'play', 'drums', 'mom', 'just', 'want', 'say', 'when', 'amazon.com', 'customers', 'buy', 'movie', 'will', 'learn', 'beginning', 'movie', 'end', 'how', 'really', 'sad', 'movie', 'end', 'past', 'away', 'boy', 'will', 'be', 'living', 'family', 'warned', 'death', 'making', '34', 'candles', 'bay', 'street', '34', 'scencic', 'locations', 'halifax', 'nova', 'Scotia', 'were', 'backdrop', 'endearing', 'movie', 'Visit', 'sets', 'learn', 'more', 'filiming', 'experience', 'behind-the-scenes', 'interviews', 'alicia', 'silverstone', 'eion', 'bailey', 'director', 'john', 'erman', 'Running', 'time', 'approximately', '98', 'minutes', '1', 'hour', '38', 'minutes']",N/A
