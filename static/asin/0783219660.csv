47796,A3CGVO10F7NPMJ,0783219660,A Customer,"[1, 2]","Anyone can brain-bash Jean-Claude Van Damme all they want..but put aside his media and legal troubles and all the rumors, and you'll find that 1995's 'Sudden Death' is a more than worthwhile movie. The Muscles from Brussels is Darren McCord, a former firefighter retired after a traumatic failed rescue attempt. While employed at Pittsburgh's Ice arena, he gives his young son and daughter two tickets to the Stanley Cup Play-Offs'. Arena security is on pins and needles, having to secure the rink to perfection to protect the United States Vice President (An Ok part played by Raymond Barry) as he attends the game. In the meantime, a cunning criminal (Powers Boothe)..(I wont give away his standing), takes the arena hostage unbeknownst to everyone but the ones inside the Presidential skybox. Superstar actor Powers Boothe is the perfect compliment to Jean-Claude's action masterpieces, accompanied by a 1-in-a-million script that gives a believable story and fantastic special effects a true spotlight. Director Peter Hyams puts touches of comedy that will work so well at first viewing, (If Youre Like Me), you'll probably have to stop the movie until you're done laughing. Just watch for the scene where Van Damme attempts to escape capture by Boothe's partners, by stealing the uniform off of the comatose Penguins goalie. Who would've thought after seeing Van Damme spin out movies like 'Bloodsport' and 'Kickboxer', that 'Sudden Death' would hit the big screen hard and still be recalled as his greatest movie of all time. This is NOT excessively violent or crude, and if you're a fan of Arnold Schwazenegger or Sylvester Stallone..this movie will be well worth your while to see or own. 'Sudden Death' is THE action movie of 1995 and a great flick for people who want a little bit of everything in it.",4,Dont Judge a Book By It's Author's Felony Record...,1019606400,"04 24, 2002",2002,1811,"['Anyone', 'can', 'brain-bash', 'Jean-Claude', 'Van', 'Damme', 'want..but', 'put', 'aside', 'media', 'legal', 'troubles', 'rumors', ""'ll"", 'find', '1995', ""'Sudden"", 'Death', 'more', 'worthwhile', 'movie', 'Muscles', 'Brussels', 'Darren', 'McCord', 'former', 'firefighter', 'retired', 'traumatic', 'failed', 'rescue', 'attempt', 'employed', 'Pittsburgh', 'Ice', 'arena', 'young', 'son', 'daughter', 'two', 'tickets', 'Stanley', 'Cup', 'Play-Offs', 'Arena', 'security', 'pins', 'needles', 'having', 'secure', 'rink', 'perfection', 'protect', 'United', 'States', 'Vice', 'President', 'Ok', 'part', 'played', 'Raymond', 'Barry', 'game', 'meantime', 'cunning', 'criminal', 'Powers', 'Boothe', '..', 'wont', 'give', 'away', 'standing', 'arena', 'hostage', 'unbeknownst', 'everyone', 'ones', 'Presidential', 'skybox', 'Superstar', 'actor', 'Powers', 'Boothe', 'perfect', 'compliment', 'Jean-Claude', 'action', 'masterpieces', 'accompanied', '1-in-a-million', 'script', 'believable', 'story', 'fantastic', 'special', 'effects', 'true', 'spotlight', 'Director', 'Peter', 'Hyams', 'touches', 'comedy', 'will', 'work', 'so', 'well', 'first', 'viewing', 'Youre', 'Me', ""'ll"", 'probably', 'have', 'stop', 'movie', ""'re"", 'done', 'laughing', 'Just', 'watch', 'scene', 'where', 'Van', 'Damme', 'attempts', 'escape', 'capture', 'Boothe', 'partners', 'stealing', 'uniform', 'off', 'comatose', 'Penguins', 'goalie', 'Who', 'would', ""'ve"", 'thought', 'seeing', 'Van', 'Damme', 'spin', 'out', 'movies', ""'Bloodsport"", ""'Kickboxer"", ""'Sudden"", 'Death', 'would', 'hit', 'big', 'screen', 'hard', 'still', 'be', 'recalled', 'greatest', 'movie', 'time', 'NOT', 'excessively', 'violent', 'crude', ""'re"", 'fan', 'Arnold', 'Schwazenegger', 'Sylvester', 'Stallone..this', 'movie', 'will', 'be', 'well', 'while', 'see', 'own', 'Death', 'action', 'movie', '1995', 'great', 'flick', 'people', 'who', 'want', 'little', 'bit', 'everything']",N/A

By the way, Mario Lemieux did play for the Penguins during that period, so how come I don't see him? And Jaromir Jagr too? Mario Lemieux is practically the savior of the Pittsburgh Penguins, so you just can't do the team without his presence. When the Game Seven of the Stanley Cup Finals was ongoing, I was getting bored by it alongside with the truly awful announcing. This was evident by the boy's tendency to let his mind to wander although I commend his choice for staying in his seat no matter what happened. By the time the game went into overtime, I was yawning, only that I wished the movie would just end. So, who won the Stanley Cup? Who cares? On the other hand, the action and the plot have been absolutely predictable from start to finish. I knew Jean-Claude Van Damme would win, and it was obvious that Powers Boothe was channeling Alan Rickman. I was surprised that I don't see any security personnel around the stadium. Even the cooking floor was literally empty. Another surprise was how Jean-Claude Van Damme got beaten up and manhandled by a mascot (a female, no less) in a very long, boring scene. In the end, I saw Powers Boothe take the girl for a hostage, but why risk the unnecessary heat? And he met his violent end pretty much in the same way as the Joker did in Batman. If the black FBI agent died, then who was calling the shots outside? In fact, was anyone doing anything? Although Van Damme saved the girl, let's not forget the inevitable number of deaths soon to follow when the dumb hockey fans made a stampede run for the exits, trampling over the others who may have fallen down on the ground. Oh, his kids validated their father's status by calling him a ""fireman."" Let me shed a tear right now.

At least he wasn't one of those talk-first, shoot-maybe-later clich&eacute;s from the world of film.The hockey scenes in here are realistic, too.  At the end, the action really gets carried away and brings the rating down on this to a manageable ""3."" Otherwise, it would be a minimum of ""4"" just for the entertainment value alone.After a slow start, it picks up when Boothe enters the movie. Then it never lets up. If you want a pure hour of action, this is it. There is no female lead in this movie, so you get no romance nor gratuitous sex scenes, which is a bit unusual. It's a straight crime story.One last note: I was disappointed my DVD did not offer a widescreen version.  That's another reason I gave this three instead of four stars.

47805,A38UHOCEKSUOSP,0783219660,"dominion_ruler ""Bryan""","[9, 9]","I am not sure why I hear a lot of bad comments about this Van Damme film.  Sudden Death is one of many ""Die Hard"" remakes, but this is the most exciting one I have seen, all taking place in the Pittsburgh hockey arena during game 7 of the Stanley Cup finals.  The action and suspense are teriffic, and Van Damme does a fine all-around performance (for Van Damme).  The movie is quickly paced and something is always happening.  Though acting and visual effects may be poor at times, this is not a film to be watching for a wonderful hollywood drama.  This is pure Van Damme excitment for some no-brain kick-butt action.  I give 4.5 stars, not because this is one of the best movies ever made, but it is one of the most exciting Van Damme movies that is must see fun.Van Damme is ""Darren"", a sort-of fire rescue man who brings his daughter and son to the hockey game.  Before the game begins, preparations are already unfolding for a new terror plot.  The Vice President is on his way to the game to view the action live, and the terrorists are ready to take action once he takes his position in the owner's vip room.  Naturally, the man in charge (Joshua Foss, played by Powers Boothe) wants money, and if he doesn't get it, he kills one hostage in the room after each period of the game expires.  If the money is not in his account, the entire arena is rigged to blow at the conclusion of the game.Enter Van Damme, who plays hero, but does an exciting job of it.  He gets in plenty of fights throughout the interior of the arena and on the rooftop as well.  My favorite is with one of the terrorist women, who is disguised in the Penguin's mascot outfit.  Its kinda silly that he is fighting a mascot, but the kitchen they fight in gets torn up real good.  There is also a pretty good fight in the weight room later on.One of the most exciting things about the film is that it is all taking place during a hockey game.  The game itself is fun to watch, as we get dozens of clips throughout the movie.  At one point, in an attempt to avoid some of the terrorists, Van Damme enters the game as the Penguin's goalee, though no one realizes it.  He is forced to play a few minutes of the game, and it was pretty fun to see.Again, 4.5 for a great Van Damme film.  Do check this one out, as it is a roller coaster that never stops.  Though the ending is predicatble, its fun to see how we get there.",4,"[4.5] a creative and exciting, highly underrated van damme film",1188172800,"08 27, 2007",2007,2394,"['am', 'not', 'sure', 'why', 'hear', 'lot', 'bad', 'comments', 'Van', 'Damme', 'film', 'Sudden', 'Death', 'one', 'many', 'Die', 'Hard', 'remakes', 'most', 'exciting', 'one', 'have', 'seen', 'taking', 'place', 'Pittsburgh', 'hockey', 'arena', 'game', '7', 'Stanley', 'Cup', 'finals', 'action', 'suspense', 'are', 'teriffic', 'Van', 'Damme', 'fine', 'all-around', 'performance', 'Van', 'Damme', 'movie', 'quickly', 'paced', 'something', 'always', 'happening', 'acting', 'visual', 'effects', 'may', 'be', 'poor', 'times', 'not', 'film', 'be', 'watching', 'wonderful', 'hollywood', 'drama', 'pure', 'Van', 'Damme', 'excitment', 'no-brain', 'kick-butt', 'action', 'give', '4.5', 'stars', 'not', 'one', 'best', 'movies', 'ever', 'made', 'one', 'most', 'exciting', 'Van', 'Damme', 'movies', 'must', 'see', 'fun.Van', 'Damme', 'Darren', 'sort-of', 'fire', 'rescue', 'man', 'who', 'daughter', 'son', 'hockey', 'game', 'game', 'preparations', 'are', 'already', 'unfolding', 'new', 'terror', 'plot', 'Vice', 'President', 'way', 'game', 'view', 'action', 'live', 'terrorists', 'are', 'ready', 'take', 'action', 'once', 'position', 'owner', 'vip', 'room', 'Naturally', 'man', 'charge', 'Joshua', 'Foss', 'played', 'Powers', 'Boothe', 'money', ""n't"", 'get', 'one', 'hostage', 'room', 'period', 'game', 'money', 'not', 'account', 'entire', 'arena', 'rigged', 'blow', 'conclusion', 'game.Enter', 'Van', 'Damme', 'who', 'hero', 'exciting', 'job', 'plenty', 'fights', 'interior', 'arena', 'rooftop', 'as', 'well', 'favorite', 'one', 'terrorist', 'women', 'who', 'disguised', 'Penguin', 'mascot', 'outfit', 'kinda', 'silly', 'fighting', 'mascot', 'kitchen', 'fight', 'torn', 'up', 'real', 'good', 'also', 'pretty', 'good', 'fight', 'weight', 'room', 'later', 'on.One', 'most', 'exciting', 'things', 'film', 'taking', 'place', 'hockey', 'game', 'game', 'fun', 'watch', 'get', 'dozens', 'clips', 'movie', 'one', 'point', 'attempt', 'avoid', 'terrorists', 'Van', 'Damme', 'game', 'Penguin', 'goalee', 'one', 'forced', 'play', 'few', 'minutes', 'game', 'was', 'pretty', 'fun', 'see.Again', '4.5', 'great', 'Van', 'Damme', 'film', 'Do', 'check', 'one', 'out', 'roller', 'coaster', 'never', 'ending', 'predicatble', 'fun', 'see', 'how', 'get', 'there']",N/A

47808,ASJ4M2XQLNN2M,0783219660,g_sark,"[6, 7]","Sudden DeathI got this movie because I was a Powers Boothe fan, and came to like the film for itself. It's gotten a lot of poor reviews, but I disagree and I think the film has a lot of value mainly because of the chemistry between the actors. My favorite parts of the film are those with interaction between Emily and Joshua Foss (Powers Boothe's character, never mentioned by name except in ending credits.) The duel of wits between these two is priceless and this is the best character (Emily) Powers Boothe ever plays against in my opinion.I believe it bears much more resemblance to the two `Under Siege' films than `Die Hard' as its critics claim. The children make this film so unique, they are a big part of why the characters are where they are, when they are; and why the plot unfolds the way it does. There is violence, and probably young children shouldn't watch it, but older mature teens might like it because of Emily and Tyler. This film deals, at least on a surface level, with many issues such as government ineptitude, job-related disability, divorce/marriage/child custody, and more.Powers Boothe, Dorian Harewood, and Colm Meaney are terrific villains. Powers Boothe especially plays a great sociopath, with the low baseline mood, superficial charm and emotional distance---although more insight than most. Whittni Wright  plays Emily McCord, with nothing listed on IMDB for her after this film---a pity really I would love to see more of her.  Ross Malinger plays Tyler McCord and he was terrific, I'm happy to see he's moved on to good things since.The film was scored by John Debney, and it's his worse piece of work; subdued especially for an action film, unoriginal, not outstanding in any way although believe me I've sat through far worse. There is an official soundtrack release but good luck finding a decent-priced copy. Debney went on to do a wonderful job on `Passion of the Christ', whodathunkit and he got a well-deserved Oscar nomination for it.My gripes: This is the tenth anniversary can we PLEASE have a widescreen release I think we've waited long enough, and a Collector's Edition with a Powers Boothe commentary would be nice but I won't hold my breath...Not a lot of extras on the DVD, but a few good behind-the-scenes items... the idea that NOONE needed to go inside or outside the stadium during the game, or that noone would have a cellphone or that there would be a media blackout for something like this REALLY stretches credulity.It is worth a $10.00 price just to have a good piece of cinema history.I would like to see a prequel or a sequel, say, with Emily and Joshua Foss meeting up someday but now I guess thanks to `Deadwood' Powers Boothe is too famous to do a sequel (and Foss seemed QUITE dead at the film's end, but this is Hollywood after all).Finally: Recently an audio book of `Sudden Death' was released on audiotape narrated by Powers Boothe, it is terrific and worth the price if you can find it.

Although I did feel like watching Street Fighter a few years back, but I was really into Kylie Minogue at the time. And I was young. That's an excuse right?I was ended up pleasantly surprised by his acting - for some reason, I'd got it into my head that he's not that good an actor. OK, he was alright, but that doesn't mean I'm going to go rushing out to buy all his films.There's nothing new about this film, but it'll grab your attention the whole time it's on the screen. It's a clone of many other movies, and and it itself, has probably been cloned over the years. What's terrific is the build up to the finale. It's one of those movies, where just when you think surely it's finished now, it brings out another twist, or another explosion, and you're swept along.There's a few silly moments included in the film - Van Damme fighting a woman in a penguin suit for example, it's so funny to see and must have been embarrassing to film! :) But it ended up with the woman in the penguin suit someone that could be easily killed off and no one worries about her.Three quarters of the way through the movie Van Damme decides to take a quick break from all the hard work - and play some hockey! At first I totally did not realise it was Van Damme, for some reason, I thought it was one of the bad guys. It wasn't until the over done ""I love you"" moment, that I realised who it was.Unfortunately, Van Damme is far overshadowed by bigger, better action heroes, despite his best attempts at an impression of Bruce Willis throughout. Arnie & Sly obviously have the bigger muscles, and dare I say it, Mr Seagull has the overall size. Who would win in a punch up?What I was most looking forward to about this was seeing little Ross Malinger again, who I best knew from Sleepless In Seattle. He doesn't play a different character, or look any older (who else wanted him to stand up & shout out ""I preferred my daddy in Sleepless In Seattle!"")Overall, it's a pretty good action movie, doesn't test the braincells too much, and is pretty good fun.",3,Let's play hockey!,1154908800,"08 7, 2006",2006,2152,"[""'ve"", 'never', 'been', 'big', 'fan', 'Jean-Claude', 'Van', 'Damme', 'last', 'night', 'had', 'never', 'watched', 'film', 'before', 'did', 'feel', 'watching', 'Street', 'Fighter', 'few', 'years', 'back', 'was', 'really', 'Kylie', 'Minogue', 'time', 'was', 'young', 'excuse', 'right', 'was', 'ended', 'up', 'pleasantly', 'surprised', 'acting', 'reason', ""'d"", 'got', 'head', 'not', 'that', 'good', 'actor', 'OK', 'was', 'alright', ""n't"", 'mean', ""'m"", 'going', 'go', 'rushing', 'buy', 'nothing', 'new', 'film', ""'ll"", 'grab', 'attention', 'whole', 'time', 'screen', 'clone', 'many', 'other', 'movies', 'probably', 'been', 'cloned', 'years', 'What', 'terrific', 'build', 'up', 'finale', 'one', 'movies', 'where', 'just', 'when', 'think', 'surely', 'finished', 'now', 'out', 'twist', 'explosion', ""'re"", 'swept', 'along.There', 'few', 'silly', 'moments', 'included', 'film', 'Van', 'Damme', 'fighting', 'woman', 'penguin', 'suit', 'example', 'so', 'funny', 'see', 'must', 'have', 'been', 'embarrassing', 'film', 'ended', 'up', 'woman', 'penguin', 'suit', 'someone', 'could', 'be', 'easily', 'killed', 'off', 'one', 'her.Three', 'quarters', 'way', 'movie', 'Van', 'Damme', 'take', 'quick', 'break', 'hard', 'work', 'play', 'hockey', 'first', 'totally', 'did', 'not', 'realise', 'was', 'Van', 'Damme', 'reason', 'thought', 'was', 'one', 'bad', 'guys', 'was', ""n't"", 'done', 'love', 'moment', 'realised', 'who', 'was.Unfortunately', 'Van', 'Damme', 'far', 'overshadowed', 'bigger', 'better', 'action', 'heroes', 'best', 'attempts', 'impression', 'Bruce', 'Willis', 'Arnie', 'Sly', 'obviously', 'have', 'bigger', 'muscles', 'dare', 'say', 'Mr', 'Seagull', 'overall', 'size', 'Who', 'would', 'win', 'punch', 'up', 'What', 'was', 'most', 'looking', 'forward', 'was', 'seeing', 'little', 'Ross', 'Malinger', 'again', 'who', 'best', 'knew', 'Sleepless', 'Seattle', ""n't"", 'play', 'different', 'character', 'look', 'older', 'who', 'else', 'wanted', 'stand', 'up', 'shout', 'preferred', 'daddy', 'Sleepless', 'Seattle', 'Overall', 'pretty', 'good', 'action', 'movie', ""n't"", 'test', 'braincells', 'too', 'much', 'pretty', 'good', 'fun']",N/A
