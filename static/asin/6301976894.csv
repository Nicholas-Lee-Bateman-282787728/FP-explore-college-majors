285659,AXSH6O4OP5L4M,6301976894,"Atheen M. Wilson ""Atheen""","[3, 3]","This is probably my favorite movie of all time.  It was filmed during a low point in international politics, the so-called ""cold war"" period.  Since I was a young person during this era and remember the fear it engendered, seeing the film put life into perspective and was a positive, enlightening, and healthy experience.As an adult, I can appreciate the panic of the ""invaded"" villagers; I could almost have seen a similar behavior arising in the small Midwestern town I lived in as a child had something like it occurred.  The rapidity with which information was transmitted and distorted throughout the community by word of mouth was familiar to me.  In fact it reminds me of the time an upset busybody called my mother to report that my brother had ""spun the wheels"" of the family car at a stop sign outside her house.  My mother, who had just arrived home merely said, ""Oh no, that was me!""  On another occasion I ended up in a ditch during stormy weather, and my parents were almost instantly aware of it via the back fence hot-line and rescue was on the way before I even had a chance to chill.  (There's a good side and a bad side to the hot line of small towns.)The Romeo and Juliet of the film are more sensible than in Shakespeare's play.  With Juliet's Capulet and Romeo's Montegue at a stand off, they fall in love but agree to wait for better times.  That makes them far more sensible and adult than their respective ""families!""  Someone should make another movie showing what happened after the collapse of the USSR; did they actually get together?  After some 25 years of waiting, was the attraction still there?My favorite scene is that of the telephone operator and the playwrite (Carl Reiner), ""Wittaker Walt"" as the Russian squad leader (Alan Arkin) calls him, tied together with phone cord, attempting to escape the office to warn people of the potential for disaster.  The gentle poke at conventions respected even in a time of apparent disaster was funny, as was the horror of the two at each anticipated minor catastrophy, already well recognized by the audience.One of the best features of the DVD version is the interview with the director Norman Jewison, who discusses the political climate of the period and the effect of the film on both sides of the contretemps.  That the Russians actually saw the film and were impressed by it was something I had not even suspected when I first got the VHS version years ago.As the story points out, the Russians and the Americans were just people, and people with the same desires: personal safety and a chance to have and raise their families.  They may be caught up in the mutual insanity of world politics, but at heart they are all world villagers whose concern for the life of a small child, one who might well be their own, is still uppermost.  The director and author managed to portray the ignorance and fear that arise from a lack of contact and the manipulation of the political elite in both countries to keep that fear enflamed.  Agendas abound, and they are often those that benefit those in control more than they do the individual people of either country.  This allows countries as entities to do without question things we might never do as individuals.  We might do well to take note; it's still going on.",5,One of the best movies every made about a political situration,1293667200,"12 30, 2010",2010,3291,"['probably', 'favorite', 'movie', 'time', 'was', 'filmed', 'low', 'point', 'international', 'politics', 'so-called', 'cold', 'war', 'period', 'was', 'young', 'person', 'era', 'remember', 'fear', 'engendered', 'seeing', 'film', 'put', 'life', 'perspective', 'was', 'positive', 'enlightening', 'healthy', 'experience.As', 'adult', 'can', 'appreciate', 'panic', 'invaded', 'villagers', 'could', 'almost', 'have', 'seen', 'similar', 'behavior', 'arising', 'small', 'Midwestern', 'town', 'lived', 'child', 'had', 'something', 'occurred', 'rapidity', 'information', 'was', 'transmitted', 'distorted', 'community', 'word', 'mouth', 'was', 'familiar', 'fact', 'time', 'upset', 'busybody', 'called', 'mother', 'report', 'brother', 'had', 'spun', 'wheels', 'family', 'car', 'stop', 'sign', 'house', 'mother', 'who', 'had', 'just', 'arrived', 'home', 'merely', 'said', 'Oh', 'was', 'occasion', 'ended', 'up', 'ditch', 'stormy', 'weather', 'parents', 'were', 'almost', 'instantly', 'aware', 'back', 'fence', 'hot-line', 'rescue', 'was', 'way', 'even', 'had', 'chance', 'chill', 'good', 'side', 'bad', 'side', 'hot', 'line', 'small', 'towns', 'Romeo', 'Juliet', 'film', 'are', 'more', 'sensible', 'Shakespeare', 'play', 'Juliet', 'Capulet', 'Romeo', 'Montegue', 'stand', 'off', 'fall', 'love', 'agree', 'wait', 'better', 'times', 'far', 'more', 'sensible', 'adult', 'respective', 'families', 'Someone', 'should', 'make', 'movie', 'showing', 'what', 'happened', 'collapse', 'USSR', 'did', 'actually', 'get', 'together', '25', 'years', 'waiting', 'was', 'attraction', 'still', 'there', 'My', 'favorite', 'scene', 'telephone', 'operator', 'playwrite', 'Carl', 'Reiner', 'Wittaker', 'Walt', 'Russian', 'squad', 'leader', 'Alan', 'Arkin', 'tied', 'together', 'phone', 'cord', 'attempting', 'escape', 'office', 'warn', 'people', 'potential', 'disaster', 'gentle', 'poke', 'conventions', 'respected', 'even', 'time', 'apparent', 'disaster', 'was', 'funny', 'was', 'horror', 'two', 'anticipated', 'minor', 'catastrophy', 'already', 'well', 'recognized', 'audience.One', 'best', 'features', 'DVD', 'version', 'interview', 'director', 'Norman', 'Jewison', 'who', 'political', 'climate', 'period', 'effect', 'film', 'sides', 'contretemps', 'Russians', 'actually', 'saw', 'film', 'were', 'impressed', 'was', 'something', 'had', 'not', 'even', 'suspected', 'when', 'first', 'got', 'VHS', 'version', 'years', 'ago.As', 'story', 'points', 'out', 'Russians', 'Americans', 'were', 'just', 'people', 'people', 'same', 'desires', 'personal', 'safety', 'chance', 'have', 'raise', 'families', 'may', 'be', 'caught', 'up', 'mutual', 'insanity', 'world', 'politics', 'heart', 'are', 'world', 'villagers', 'concern', 'life', 'small', 'child', 'one', 'who', 'might', 'well', 'be', 'own', 'still', 'uppermost', 'director', 'author', 'managed', 'portray', 'ignorance', 'fear', 'arise', 'lack', 'contact', 'manipulation', 'political', 'elite', 'countries', 'keep', 'fear', 'enflamed', 'Agendas', 'abound', 'are', 'often', 'benefit', 'control', 'more', 'do', 'individual', 'people', 'country', 'countries', 'entities', 'do', 'question', 'things', 'might', 'never', 'do', 'individuals', 'might', 'do', 'well', 'take', 'note', 'still', 'going']",N/A

The reason I compare the two films is that they are both set during the Cold War and deal with our paranoia about the Russians as our enemies comedically. DR. STRANGELOVE remains a classic satire whereas this film, despite its talented cast and director (Norman Jewison), comes off dated and not even funny.  I think the problem is that by today's standards, it is just too heavy handed.  It is played so broadly for laughs that the movie seems to schreech, ""Laugh at me!""Alan Arkin plays a Russian submarine commander who gets his sub caught on the reefs outside a New England town.  The Russians have to go into town to get the materials to salvage their boat so they can get back to sea. This sets off madcap interactions with the townspeople and the Russians, executed by such talented comedians as Carl Reiner and Jonathan Winters.We have also become more sophisticated by watching foreign films and tv, which relatively few Americans did back in the 1960s. Thus, it is impossible to believe Arkin and his crew as anything but 100% American.This just oozes with '50s and '60s sentimentality too, to wit: a budding romance between a Russian seaman and Carl Reiner's daughter plus a little boy falling off a church steeple as a rallying point.I can't go less than three stars though because despite these problems, you are able to see the developing ability  of some of the biggest talents of later decades: Carl Reiner, Norman Jewison, and Alan Arkin, to name just a few.

285679,A13E0ARAXI6KJW,6301976894,Ed Uyeshima,"[4, 9]","Some of the bloom is off this relatively genial 1966 comedy that satirizes Cold War-era attitudes well before d&eacute;tente was established between the two sides. Directed by Norman Jewison, the film now has a relatively prosaic quality that makes the then-alarming situation between a group of Soviet soldiers and the townsfolk on an island off Massachusetts not terribly exciting. Adapted by William Rose from a book by Nathaniel Benchley, the story concerns a Russian submarine that runs aground on a sandbar on U.S. soil. Eight crewman led by Lt. Rozanov are dispatched to find a boat big enough to pull the submarine free. They first encounter a New York family vacationing on the island, a musical comedy playwright named Walt Whittaker with his wife and son. The Whittakers gradually overcome their fears to help the men out but not before the rest of the town is up in arms about a perceived Russian invasion. It all leads to a tense confrontation, but a surprise turn provides all with a greater sense of their brotherhood and the value of peace.Carl Reiner plays Whittaker with his trademark manic energy but in a warmer hue than his Alan Brady persona. Eva Marie Saint plays his wife Elspeth, but the reactive role is well beneath her abilities. On the other hand, a convincingly Russian-accented Alan Arkin brings a zesty spirit to Rozanov in his feature film debut. An ensemble of comic character actors play the townsfolk with predictable eccentricity - Brian Keith as the flustered police chief, Jonathan Winters as a pompous police officer, Paul Ford as the overly zealous head of the local chapter of the Veterans of Foreign Wars. There is a disposable romantic subplot between a young Russian sailor and the Whittakers' comely babysitter. There are even a couple of unexpected moments when the movie threatens to become more of a serious statement. The 2002 DVD has a couple of solid extras - a funny vintage trailer featuring Reiner and Arkin out of character as an interviewer and a Russian tourist, and a 23-minute making-of featurette produced for the DVD featuring Jewison reminiscing about the production and the positive impact it had on Cold War relations.

285688,A2BVCT2MPS6LHI,6301976894,Huge Viking,"[6, 7]","A great Cold War spoof of a classic when a Soviet naval submarine winds up running aground on Gloucester Island, Massachusetts, all because its captain (Theodore Bikel) never saw America and strayed too close. The hilarious events occur on a peaceful Sunday morning when nine of the sailors led by Lt. Rosanov (Alan Arkin) were looking for a powerful motorboat to pull the sub free. This was filmed in 1965 during the height of the Cold War and was actually shown in Moscow not long after its release. Interesting about the movie was that there were no English subtitles when the sub crew were speaking Russian. It would keep the audience guessing what they were saying. One part was when Lt. Rosanov would tell Alexei Kolchin (John Phillip Law), the only two Russians who could speak English, in Russian while at the Whittaker summer home; ""...we are just strangers and we won't tell them we're Russians.""To make the film appealing for the two superpowers was that Kolchin was the all-Russian boy, and finding that all-American girl to play the role of Alison Palmer where the two fall in love took a little time. Andrea Dromm - this was her only feature film appearance - fit that role since she was, in real life, a spokesgirl for American Airlines. Veteran actors such as Carl Reiner, Jonathan Winters, Ben Blue and Paul Ford were well represented in the all star comedy film ""It's a Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad World"" (1963) and had reunited in this film, bringing with them their style of humor as one silly thing happens after another.Alan Arkin and some of the other actors who played the Russians had to learn to speak Russian prior to filming which was shot at various locations, mainly in Mendocino County on California's north coast and on Nantucket Island, Massachusetts. Weather conditions hampered filming the movie entirely on Nantucket Island, but California's north coast was perfect, not only for its milder climate, but for its New England-style coastal towns.",5,I Think They're Creeping Up on This House!,1114300800,"04 24, 2005",2005,1971,"['great', 'Cold', 'War', 'spoof', 'classic', 'when', 'Soviet', 'naval', 'submarine', 'up', 'running', 'aground', 'Gloucester', 'Island', 'Massachusetts', 'all', 'captain', 'Theodore', 'Bikel', 'never', 'saw', 'America', 'strayed', 'too', 'close', 'hilarious', 'events', 'occur', 'peaceful', 'Sunday', 'morning', 'when', 'nine', 'sailors', 'led', 'Lt.', 'Rosanov', 'Alan', 'Arkin', 'were', 'looking', 'powerful', 'motorboat', 'pull', 'sub', 'free', 'was', 'filmed', '1965', 'height', 'Cold', 'War', 'was', 'actually', 'shown', 'Moscow', 'not', 'long', 'release', 'Interesting', 'movie', 'was', 'were', 'English', 'subtitles', 'when', 'sub', 'crew', 'were', 'speaking', 'Russian', 'would', 'keep', 'audience', 'guessing', 'what', 'were', 'saying', 'One', 'part', 'was', 'when', 'Lt.', 'Rosanov', 'would', 'tell', 'Alexei', 'Kolchin', 'John', 'Phillip', 'Law', 'only', 'two', 'Russians', 'who', 'could', 'speak', 'English', 'Russian', 'while', 'Whittaker', 'summer', 'home', 'are', 'just', 'strangers', 'wo', ""n't"", 'tell', ""'re"", 'Russians', 'make', 'film', 'appealing', 'two', 'superpowers', 'was', 'Kolchin', 'was', 'all-Russian', 'boy', 'finding', 'all-American', 'girl', 'play', 'role', 'Alison', 'Palmer', 'where', 'two', 'fall', 'love', 'took', 'little', 'time', 'Andrea', 'Dromm', 'was', 'only', 'feature', 'film', 'appearance', 'fit', 'role', 'was', 'real', 'life', 'spokesgirl', 'American', 'Airlines', 'Veteran', 'actors', 'such', 'Carl', 'Reiner', 'Jonathan', 'Winters', 'Ben', 'Blue', 'Paul', 'Ford', 'were', 'well', 'represented', 'star', 'comedy', 'film', 'Mad', 'Mad', 'Mad', 'Mad', 'World', '1963', 'had', 'reunited', 'film', 'bringing', 'style', 'humor', 'one', 'silly', 'thing', 'happens', 'another.Alan', 'Arkin', 'other', 'actors', 'who', 'played', 'Russians', 'had', 'learn', 'speak', 'Russian', 'prior', 'filming', 'was', 'shot', 'various', 'locations', 'mainly', 'Mendocino', 'County', 'California', 'north', 'coast', 'Nantucket', 'Island', 'Massachusetts', 'Weather', 'conditions', 'hampered', 'filming', 'movie', 'entirely', 'Nantucket', 'Island', 'California', 'north', 'coast', 'was', 'perfect', 'not', 'only', 'milder', 'climate', 'New', 'England-style', 'coastal', 'towns']",N/A

There is no end to the mirth in this one as the Russians find themselves stranded off Cape Cod, and go in search of help.  Soon the whole town is in a panic, with forces mobilized against the red peril.  Jewison makes the most of the situation, creating so many amusing scenes anchored by excellent performances.

THE RUSSIANS ARE COMING, THE RUSSIANS ARE COMING, released in 1966.The captain of a Soviet submarine cruising off New England wants a close-up view of forbidden Amerika, so he heads closer and closer inshore despite the frantic warnings from his crew about a rising sea bottom, and he soon finds himself hard aground on an off-shore island. Early the next morning, he orders a landing party ashore under the command of his long-suffering First Officer, Lt. Rozanov, played by Alan Arkin in his first big screen appearance. Their mission, to find a motorboat powerful enough to drag the sub off the shoal. After stealing a car from an isolated beach house, they head off to the island's population center, such as it is,  to look for their tow.Of course, the submariners' quest must be accomplished on the sly since they don't want to be captured and imprisoned as spies. Observed by an early rising old biddy, she manages to get off an agitated report to an incredulous Chief of Police before the phone line is cut. This one warning, overheard by a gossipy switchboard operator, results in a torrent of escalating rumors and frantic running-about as the hastily armed locals become convinced that their island is the beachhead of a full scale Russian invasion of America. As the hysteria mounts, the Russians scurry from one hiding place to the next in an effort to reach the island's main boat anchorage undetected.The cast is superb. Brian Keith plays the level-headed and exasperated Chief of Police, who is fully occupied keeping the local, trigger-happy citizenry under control. Jonathan Winters is his hyperexcitable deputy. Carl Reiner is the head of the family from whom the sailors initially commandeered the car. The film was nominated for Best Picture and Best Actor (Arkin) Oscars, and won two Golden Globes: Best Film (Musical/Comedy) and Best Actor (Musical/Comedy). Arkin won the latter.The final confrontation between the Soviet vessel, its foolish captain, played by Theodore Bikel, and the aroused islanders is a lesson on brinkmanship that deserves to be studied by the world at large.

Some of the scenes look like Northern California harbors to me, but some have the tangy salt air of Nantucket filtering through them.  There's no handheld shooting here, but Jewison's cameras peer into quite intimate spaces, and the life of the professional sailor really comes through--the hapless amateur as well.  Mostly the movie is about what happens when a tourist class descends on a town of professionals; it's sort of like THE PERFECT STORM except without a disaster.  But Carl Reiner, as the vacationing writer, is neither fish nor fowl and the scenes where he has to collaborate with the village's Tessie O'Shea are hilarious sketches of class conflict that Preston Sturges might have been proud of.While the love interest centers on the All-American teen (Andrea Dromm, whose film credits are woefully few) hooking up with the All-Russian boy played by John Philip Law, the main story of the movie lies elsewhere, in watching the two superpowers collide on a human scale.  The romance is given maybe a third of the time it would occupy in an ordinary movie.  Law was only a year or so away from playing with Jane Fonda in Barbarella and Hurry Sundown, and DANGER DIABOLIK was still in his future.  In RUSSIANS he was nearly thirty but could pass for a very young man.  I'm sure he did more than most people to defuse Cold War tensions.Most of the time the filmmakers seem to be saying, ""Though in America we generally think the Russians are crazy and inbred, actually it's the people of Nantucket who are the dangerous gun crazy nuts.""  In 1965 this was a surprising attitude for a Hollywood studio movie to take and was a true harbinger of things to come.  The director, Norman Jewison, hailed from Canada and was sometimes credited with bringing a pair of fresh eyes to the production.  It wasn't only a newly liberal attitude, it was a philosophy of casting, so that the most attractive cast members no longer had the highest billing.  Before this era in American film a man like Alan Arkin would never have been billed above John Philip Law.  That would have been un-American LOL!

It was very funny than and it is just as refreshing today.This is the story about a Russian sub-Captain who decides to breach the 25 mile coastal barrier of the United States at a time when we were deeply in the cold war and the Russians were all citizens of the glorious Soviet Union or so they called it often. They were at the time, enemies bent on the destruction of the United States of America, in place of their brand of communism (something that works on paper, but not in practice). Anyhow they get so close to the United States shores of a New England Island community that their submarine became stuck on a sand bar. That was the first act of war against the United States. The Captain than sends a group of crew members (lead by Russian speaking Alan Arkin) ashore. They are in uniform, that is the second act of war on the United States. But they are not only in uniform. They have machine guns, a third act of war against the United States of America.They soon find a family with a father who is a nervous wreck, Carl Reiner, In his own respect a longtime great actor (the real life father of meathead-Rob Reiner) and a boy who spots the Russians and wants to do the right thing and shoot them. So throughout the movie, the kid when we see him is being held back, but in a funny sort of way.The family is soon overcome and the group takes their car, lead by a hilarious and persistent Alan Arkin, but they leave a blonde (machine gun toting) guy behind to guard the family. In a distraction and struggle the father (of meathead) gains the upper hand and chases blondie off, or so they figure. With the car gone, he soon takes a bicycle towards town while the family waits.The Sheriff of the town played by Brian Keith A great actor we all miss dearly these days, and the Deputy, played by an always funny Jonathon Winters fall into their own chaos amongst panicked (understandably) townsfolk. The idea of the group of Russian's going into town is to steal a large motor boat to tow the sub off the sand bar. Will they succeed in all the madness that pursues, amongst other subplots like a love story? I can tell you this has a great ending, and its well worth watching.

285713,AXYIW2PVCWTNU,6301976894,Only review if I know,"[2, 4]","The movie was nominated for a Nobel Peace Prize.  True. Shown to senators, Vice President Hubert Humphrey et al. it was and still is considered a valuable piece of work based on it's message. Not the funnay antics of a town in hysteria over a submarine, of terrified Russians, going a ground, their submarine stuck, when the captain wants to get a ""closer look at America"".  Living in the town it was filmed, with more weather delays then the producers, director and cast wanted and yet in the end, not enough?  Jonathon Winters led the at first entertainment and antics of the ""Russians""  and when on location for so long, amongst us. As the cast and crew an open friendly book, and dressed as Russians,  the friendship of two countries that happens in the movie, was an incredible bond for the movie makers and my small town.  When  filming of a scene in the end of the movie, was truly sweated out as dangerous we did it together.  It was dangerous and we wanted the almighty fog we can not control to stay out.  We were shredded in fog for 2 1/2 months and therefore Russians.  We lived and learned, the message, we are all the same and war takes the life of loving men and women, and it scares both sides and is for no reason. If you again say you believe  ""the movie has lost it's appeal due to the lack of knowledge of the USSR"", probably your kids, you have a history lesson to give.  A wonderful vehicle for just that, for getting the Peace message again, for traveling to my town and yes, a good laugh. I love it's a mad, mad world. The two movies are not the same and none to ever be compared to the movie of that day, when we all feared,the Russian Bomb, and in came a submarine instead. As scared as you.  Thru the antics of Winters, and the wonderful calmness of Brian Keith both off and on set, and a very young Arkin and Radar  befoe MASH, (and this the beginning list of stars only), we had quite a great and emotional time as we learned to love the Russians and then they left.  They are as great on screen as off.  The horse scene, the company waited two weeks for sun, and shot it all day long. We all took lunches and sat around ....... Drive.  Winters came by for a taste sampling of his desires, so hysterically funny and yes he learned how to keep PEACE. DO NOT EVER, EVER TAKE MY GRANDMOTHER'S LAST DEVILED EGG. He thought she should be president.  The needed  calm seas for the ending of the good bye scene. (Trying not to give away to much) for the departure was a statement of the power of the movie and of friendship.  The submarine in the Harbour was an errie reminder of what we thought could be, the invasion of the United States by Russia and yet our fears were the bomb.  In the end, and we were a hungry town, the company had offered money for boats to come.  We all rode on the metaphoric but emotionally high ""Yellow Submarine"" and did not charge for the boats.  So.... Teach the kids, USSR, History, Same peace message as today, and yes very, very funny.  For both sides, hosting community and movie maker, it was a statement of PEACE and not just a bunch of hysterical  antics or a statement that unfortunately is not outdated. Don't get me wrong, anyone not loving the tied up couple, the motorcycle or the horse, well, it is hysterically funny and if you are not thinking so tie yourself up to someone. Then you will understand. Most of our town did, we even had tie up parties. I know. We were in the fog.  During the filming by the way, if you think it to be a satarical pun of the time, The great New York Ctiy Blackout happened during filiming of the movie.  Children and adults were hysterically running nowhere screaming ""The Russians Are Coming, The Russians are Coming"".  This was beore media publicity and movie release. The Russians never did officailly come. But they did for me. They can for you, watch it.

Everyone they come in contact with panics and spreads rumors of a Soviet invasion, starting with Carl Reiner and Eva Marie Saint, renting a beach house.The cast is full of great comedians and character actors who propogate panic as Arkin and his men cross the island, including, among others:  Ben Blue as the town drunk assigned to ride his horse out to the shacks beyond the dump to alert the few citizens who live there; Paul Ford (The Music Man) as a pompous veteran; Jonathan Winters as an oversized Barney Fife; and Brian Keith, who plays the Sheriff straight which cleverly sets up a more dramatic climax.Keith's standoff with Bikel at the end makes the whole movie worthwile for its poignancy as well as comedy.",5,"Satire, slapstick, suspense evenly build to poignant climax.",1129161600,"10 13, 2005",2005,1371,"['Russians', 'Are', 'Coming', 'Russians', 'Are', 'Coming', 'one', 'best', 'comedies', '1960s', 'opinion', 'tried', 'frantic', 'atmosphere', 'made', 'Mad', 'Mad', 'Mad', 'Mad', 'World', 'work', 'less', 'big', 'stars', 'measured', 'bit', 'drama', 'message', 'evenly', 'blended', 'satire', 'slapstick.During', 'height', 'cold', 'war', 'captain', 'USSR', 'submarine', 'Theodore', 'Bikel', 'who', 'played', 'artist', 'A', 'Dog', 'Flanders', 'closer', 'look', 'America', 'accidently', 'sub', 'shore', 'northeastern', 'island', 'Alan', 'Arkin', 'In-Laws', 'Russian', 'officer', 'ashore', 'small', 'party', 'find', 'boat', 'suitable', 'free', 'sub', 'Everyone', 'come', 'contact', 'panics', 'spreads', 'rumors', 'Soviet', 'invasion', 'starting', 'Carl', 'Reiner', 'Eva', 'Marie', 'Saint', 'renting', 'beach', 'house.The', 'cast', 'full', 'great', 'comedians', 'character', 'actors', 'who', 'propogate', 'panic', 'Arkin', 'men', 'cross', 'island', 'including', 'others', 'Ben', 'Blue', 'town', 'drunk', 'assigned', 'ride', 'horse', 'shacks', 'dump', 'alert', 'few', 'citizens', 'who', 'live', 'there', 'Paul', 'Ford', 'Music', 'Man', 'pompous', 'veteran', 'Jonathan', 'Winters', 'oversized', 'Barney', 'Fife', 'Brian', 'Keith', 'who', 'Sheriff', 'straight', 'cleverly', 'up', 'more', 'dramatic', 'climax.Keith', 'standoff', 'Bikel', 'end', 'whole', 'movie', 'worthwile', 'poignancy', 'as', 'well', 'comedy']",N/A

285723,A2OLM3EXS7JHZ8,6301976894,"Richard Posner ""wordspinner""","[14, 22]","I feel really old when I realize that I saw this film in a movie theater when it first came out. At that time, Carl Reiner was well-known from the Sid Caesar Show and the Dick Van Dyke Show, and Alan Arkin had made a big comic splash in &quot;Enter Laughing&quot; and was considered a rising star (somehow he never achieved full stardom and wound up doing odd character roles). Eva Marie Saint was a powerhouse dramatic actress (&quot;On The Waterfront&quot;) doing a politically-incorrect simpering housewife role. Paul Ford was known for playing the colonel on the Phil Silvers &quot;Sergeant Bilko&quot; series. John Philip Law was the hunk du jour (and whatever happened to him?)and Andrea Dromm, the other half of the love story, apparently played out her entire movie career in this one film.Initially, I was disappointed in the film because I'd read Nathaniel Benchley's novel, &quot;The Off-Islanders,&quot; which was a much richer and more subtle story. In time, the movie won me over and I still love watching it. Most of the deliberately &quot;comic&quot; set pieces misfire--many of the routines go on too long (the blustery tension between Paul Ford's obsessed veteran and Brian Keith's put-upon police chief, for example)and Jewison, a good director in other respects, has no sense of comic timing.I do laugh, though, at the silly bit where Reiner and Tessie O'Shea are tied up face to face and attempt to get down a steep flight of stairs. This is funny mostly because of Reiner's own timing. Overall, the film could benefit by a cut of about 10-15 minutes.What does keep me coming back is the warm, layered characterization of Alan Arkin's lieutenant and the journey of Carl Reiner's musical comedy writer from terrified schnook to murderous family man to chastened and maturing citizen.Reiner is actually scary when he fires a shotgun through the window of the car Arkin is driving. He's been pushed to the edge by his obnoxious son's goading and by the frightening threats to his family.The scene where he looks into the window of the crashed car and tries to apologize to the even-more-frightened Arkin is delicate and charmingly funny.Arkin seems to be in another film most of the time. His character is richly detailed and subtle. He is clearly a better sailor than his stubborn captain (Theodore Bikel), and his repressed fury at the captain's stupidity is a character study in itself. He portrays fear, determination, resourcefulness, tenderness, and exasperation, all without pushing or overacting (the same can't be said for some of the other principals, notably Jonathan Winters, who never succeeds in a scripted part).There is gentle satire in the portrayal of the easily duped and insular residents of Gloucester Island (Arkin's attempt to pronounce this name from a map is a gem in itself), though silent movie star Ben Blue wildly overacts. Brian Keith captures the weariness of a small town police chief's life, and his personal best moment comes when he faces the Soviet sub, guns trained on his town, and whips out his citation book to write out a ticket.The mandatory romance isn't too annoying since Law and Dromm play it low-key and have some genuine charm. The two children are dreadfully annoying, though the boy is meant to be that way. Reiner's cry to his wife, &quot;Hit him!&quot; as he drives away, will definitely draw a sympathetic laugh.The other unfortunate note (aside from the romance)is the Hollywood ending. The sub captain is bluffing the townspeople, thinking his men are being held (they aren't; they've commandeered a speedboat which unaccountably missed seeing the sub sail into the harbor). He threatens to blow up the town in one minute. The townspeople, in a wonderful shot, take aim with their hunting rifles and pistols, terror showing in their eyes. The captain is also terrified. The standoff has real tension, but it's solved by the awful gimmick of having a little boy (who to this point has played no part in the film) dangle from a church tower. Naturally, the Russian sailors scramble from the sub to help and everyone is now consumed with a spirit of detente. It leaves a bad taste, made worse by Saint's suggestion that the townspeople escort the sub safely out of the harbor (no doubt they will all face intense grilling by our government, and possibly jail time).However, I always recover from that lapse and the movie leaves me feeling mostly charmed and happy. I find myself reciting &quot;Egermecy--everybody to get from street!&quot; at odd times, and I realize that this film makes me nostalgic for a time when movie comedies did not have to be vicious or filthy or both.",4,Character Is Key In This Low-Key Comedy,980121600,"01 22, 2001",2001,4648,"['feel', 'really', 'old', 'when', 'realize', 'saw', 'film', 'movie', 'theater', 'when', 'first', 'came',

285725,A5BAE3SEOGND5,6301976894,"Robin Wolfson ""Reliza""","[8, 12]","Forget the American characters, the story here is the Russians, led by Theodore Bikel as the Russian sub captain who just wants to get a closer look at the enemy and Alan Arkin as his long-suffering first officer. (As well as John Phillip Law as a young and innocent Russian sailor.) And yes, Arkin's wonderful line &quot;Everybody to get from strit&quot; has long been a family favorite.As for the nostalgia for &quot;simpler days&quot; of the sixties, let's remember that this film was made in 1965/66, which means it was written no later than 1964. Deep, dark, scary days. It was released only three years after the murder of President Kennedy, four after the Cuban missile crisis, a year at most after the Tonkin Gulf incident that provided the US with a convenient excuse for committing troops to Vietnam, a short ten years after the Mau Mau massacres in the Congo, another short ten years after the Russians sent tanks into Hungary, and a very short twenty years after World War II.There was nothing simple or innocent about those days. The world was tired and aching. Can anyone be blamed for making films that featured a simpler context: a small town where everyone really does know everyone else, where people take care of each other despite their differences, and where a few people from opposite sides of the cold war can work together? &quot;The Russians Are Coming. . .&quot; belongs to a genre of peace films that reached their zenith in the fifties and sixties, climaxing, of course, with &quot;Dr. Strangelove, or How I Stopped Worrying and Learned to Love the Bomb.&quot; Others in this genre include &quot;The Day the Earth Stood Still,&quot; a long-forgotten sci-fi film called &quot;The 37th Day,&quot; &quot;Fail Safe,&quot; and &quot;The President's Analyst&quot; which, like &quot;The Russians Are Coming. . .&quot; seems dated now but still wears well.If it seems quaint and innocent now, bear in mind that all times but our own seem quaint and innocent, simply because we're not involved in them. We don't have to pick up the paper every day and wonder about whether we really should behead the king or put a bomb shelter in our back yard (yes, I had friends who had them). Like beauty, quaintness and innocence are often in the eye of the beholder.But above all, the film is driven by Alan Arkin's brilliant performance as a man who understands only too well the full import of the situation in which he's trapped. His growing desperation as the situation becomes at once funnier and more dangerous is set against the insane and inane kneejerk patriotism of both the Americans and the Russians and mark him as the only sane man in the asylum. For all the film's innocent silliness, its message is much darker: how does a sane man survive in a world gone mad?

I laughed then, and haven't stopped.I have a habit of collecting films that are a must for my library when they come out in different formats. So, while I already had this in VCR, it's now necessary to get it for DVD. It hasn't lost even a little of its humorous effect.Where does one start? Alan Arkin was brilliant, deserved an academy award. Carl Reiner was fabulous. Perhaps my favorite of all, even to this day, was Paul Ford. (Oh, and Jonothan Winter's part is incredible.)But the DVD is even better than the others. You see, there's an interview with producer/director Norman Jewison that's worth its weight in gold. He goes on about how well the actors worked together. And I remember that the film, even in my much younger days, gave me some hope: Maybe we CAN live together despite Cold War rhetoric and the like. It seems the Russians felt the same way!This is a film that should be part of everyone's collection. It's hysterial, satirical, some of the finest acting I've ever seen--and a collection of one liners to make the Marx Bros. jealous.
