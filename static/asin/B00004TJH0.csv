It followed the course of the decade from start to finish very nicely, encorporating in music and actual footage of the historic events together with the respective storylines of the four main characters.  Still, it just doesn't seem quite as gripping and involving as the prior movie 'The '60s,' where there seemed to be more character development instead of, like this movie, seeming to focus a bit more on a lot of historic happenings and making as many of them a part of their lives as possible, instead of just choosing ones that would have naturally fit with whom the characters were.  The plot seems to suffer a little because of this.  There also seemed like there were more gaps of time than in 'The '60s,' with a few years passing between events a couple of times without letting the viewer know what year it was now supposed to be or how much time had passed.",4,Not quite as good as the precursor,1111622400,"03 24, 2005",2005,1016,"['One', 'should', ""n't"", 'expect', 'too', 'much', 'what', 'was', 'made-for-tv', 'miniseries', 'real', 'big', 'names', 'was', 'very', 'good', 'involving', 'story', 'followed', 'course', 'decade', 'start', 'finish', 'very', 'nicely', 'encorporating', 'music', 'actual', 'footage', 'historic', 'events', 'together', 'respective', 'storylines', 'four', 'main', 'characters', 'Still', 'just', ""n't"", 'seem', 'quite', 'gripping', 'involving', 'prior', 'movie', ""'60s"", 'where', 'there', 'seemed', 'be', 'more', 'character', 'development', 'instead', 'movie', 'seeming', 'focus', 'bit', 'more', 'lot', 'historic', 'happenings', 'making', 'many', 'part', 'lives', 'possible', 'instead', 'just', 'choosing', 'ones', 'would', 'have', 'naturally', 'fit', 'whom', 'characters', 'were', 'plot', 'suffer', 'little', 'also', 'seemed', 'were', 'more', 'gaps', 'time', ""'The"", ""'60s"", 'few', 'years', 'passing', 'events', 'couple', 'times', 'letting', 'viewer', 'know', 'what', 'year', 'was', 'now', 'supposed', 'be', 'how', 'much', 'time', 'had', 'passed']",N/A

550358,A2582KMXLK2P06,B00004TJH0,B. E Jackson,"[0, 1]","I found many of the segments in the '70s either confusing or boring.  It focuses heavily on the political spectrum with the numerous protests and the younger generation rising and making a stand against the government, which is all fine and good but there's a couple problems along the way.  It's well, boring.  Now I normally enjoy this time period tremendously, especially the music (which doesn't disappoint either- several classic tracks such as those from John Lennon and Carole King to name a couple can be heard).  The storytelling is either really suspenseful though rushed and unorganized (the police shoot-out in the beginning is the biggest example of this) or we're watching the younger generation rather dreadfully and predictably getting involved in politics.  We've seen this all before in better films.  And yes, it *does* feel more like the year it was released (2000) opposed to the decade it's trying to portray.

The mass media (which has done a wonderful job distorting feminism) actually does a wonderful job acknowlleging that yes equality does not mean anti-man. Obviously my favirote historical vingetts (dispersed throughout ala Forrest Gump) are those about the feminist movement. I also thought it was cool her parents accepted her politics and they essentially became a feminist family.Between the anti-war movement, feminism and environmentalism, this was a really awesome mini-series. I also liked the black panthers community rejuvination and empowerment, but could not stand Kristy the blond party girl . Even though it problaly happened to people living during this time, I can't believe it would take her an entire decade to get her head on straight. If modeling was her fall back career, we never learn what she actually hoped to do with her life.Even though I (thankfully) am not a conservative Republican, Byron's saga really hit home too. His political idealism fades when he discovers Washington DC is not quite as moral as expected. Considering I am nearing graduation and looking for jobs, I have always interpreted this as a cautionary tale to excercize a healthy amount of skepticism about life. On the plus side, he knew about Eileen's feminist politics and this did not make a difference to him, so kudos to that character.",5,This was great,962582400,"07 3, 2000",2000,1509,"['am', 'often', 'told', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'activist', '1960', '70', 'now', 'believe', 'seeing', 'show.My', 'favirote', 'character', 'Eileen', 'feminist', 'friends', 'mass', 'media', 'done', 'wonderful', 'job', 'distorting', 'feminism', 'actually', 'wonderful', 'job', 'acknowlleging', 'yes', 'equality', 'not', 'mean', 'anti-man', 'Obviously', 'favirote', 'historical', 'vingetts', 'dispersed', 'ala', 'Forrest', 'Gump', 'are', 'feminist', 'movement', 'also', 'thought', 'was', 'cool', 'parents', 'accepted', 'politics', 'essentially', 'became', 'feminist', 'anti-war', 'movement', 'feminism', 'environmentalism', 'was', 'really', 'awesome', 'mini-series', 'also', 'liked', 'black', 'panthers', 'community', 'rejuvination', 'empowerment', 'could', 'not', 'stand', 'Kristy', 'blond', 'party', 'girl', 'Even', 'happened', 'people', 'living', 'time', 'ca', ""n't"", 'believe', 'would', 'take', 'entire', 'decade', 'get', 'head', 'straight', 'modeling', 'was', 'fall', 'back', 'career', 'never', 'learn', 'what', 'actually', 'hoped', 'do', 'life.Even', 'thankfully', 'am', 'not', 'conservative', 'Republican', 'Byron', 'saga', 'really', 'hit', 'home', 'too', 'political', 'idealism', 'fades', 'when', 'Washington', 'DC', 'not', 'quite', 'as', 'moral', 'expected', 'Considering', 'am', 'nearing', 'graduation', 'looking', 'jobs', 'have', 'always', 'interpreted', 'cautionary', 'tale', 'excercize', 'healthy', 'amount', 'skepticism', 'life', 'plus', 'side', 'knew', 'Eileen', 'feminist', 'politics', 'did', 'not', 'make', 'difference', 'so', 'kudos', 'character']",N/A

550366,A3373I4II32NA1,B00004TJH0,Tyler,"[1, 1]","I saw this movie a long time ago when it appeared as a miniseries for two seperate days on a regular TV channel. As a teenager, I was intrigued at this insight into the 70's, which is told through the experiences of four regular college kids. I never saw the movie again for the next 10-12 years, but it remained on my mind on some key memories that were hard to forget...until I ordered this movie through Amazon, and much to my delight, got to relive the entire movie once more for an exciting 2 and a half hours!One student is a Negro who attends Kent State in Ohio, but also is a member of the National Guard, to avoid service in Vietnam, and also to help pay for his tuition. But when he's called into service against the antiwar mobs that first set fire to the ROTC building, he experiences the deaths of 4 college kids at the hands of fellow trigger-happy weekend warriors and he deserts the Guard, buys a movie theater that he attended as a kid, and as time goes by, turns it into a Black Nationalist headquarters for certain meetings. He dates and later marries an older woman with a child, who lost a husband in the war, and is also betrayed by a close friend, resulting in his near-death and his nice Mustang being totaled. Yowch!Amy Smart plays another of the college girls, who loses a boyfriend at Kent State as well, and she leaves college, kind of puttering around through life with numerous jobs, and finds a new boyfriend who manages a recording studio, coming to blows with him later on and realizing her grief when she comes to apologize to him and finding out that he killed himself as an OD on drugs. It takes a while before she can recover from that, but in her true belief in trying to express herself, she joins a wacko cult, which brainwash her to the point where she doesn't know her own name, or her parents. Her own friends are forced to kidnap her from the cult house, and try to reprogram her back into her old life.This girl's best friend is Eileen, who drops out of Kent State after that bloody day of May, 1970 and moves to New York City, hoping to put her skills to work there. Her new roommate is one of those kooky feminist-rights women who holds meetings in their apartments and also backlashes Eileen on the first day upon realizing that Eileen's mother is still a homemaker by choice. Eileen is soon dismayed at the decision of her parents to divorce and avoids her mother when she takes on a new boyfriend, taking the side of her father in the result. Unable to find a job opening at her true calling, she reluctantly takes on the job as secretary in an advertising firm, hoping to raise up in the ranks while giving her boss many good ideas on certain assignments, which he takes the full credit for. After years of this going on and losing the open position of the job she earned to another candidate who is scarcely qualified, she files a lawsuit for sexual indiscrimination against the company, and despite a heartbreaking testimony of a fellow secretary who had been in that position for over 20 years, she loses the lawsuit, but finally gets her dream position in the end with another company.The last character is the guy who plays Amy Smart's brother, and is also secretly in love with Eileen the entire time. His parents are dismayed at his idea to quit law school, but are overjoyed when they find out his job offer is taking him to work for the government in Washington. He plays a huge part in giving out plans of the Democratic Headquarters Building to government officials during the election of 1972, which soon becomes a scandal in the Watergate crisis, and he is soon subpoenaed to testify hia involvement in Watergate, thereby losing his job as an aide in the White House after Nixon resigns. Unable to grasp this with his reputation, he soon finds himself in exile out as an oil pipeline worker in Alaska and protests the government spills that affect wildlife out there in Alaska. Several times, he tries to get with Eileen, without much success, but they get married, which is the last scene in this movie.I enjoyed it very much and will be referring it to my friends and coworkers!",5,Must see this movie!,1284681600,"09 17, 2010",2010,4144,"['saw', 'movie', 'long', 'time', 'when', 'appeared', 'miniseries', 'two', 'seperate', 'days', 'regular', 'TV', 'channel', 'teenager', 'was', 'intrigued', 'insight', '70', 'told', 'experiences', 'four', 'regular', 'college', 'kids', 'never', 'saw', 'movie', 'again', 'next', '10-12', 'years', 'remained', 'mind', 'key', 'memories', 'were', 'hard', 'forget', 'ordered', 'movie', 'Amazon', 'much', 'delight', 'got', 'relive', 'entire', 'movie', 'once', 'more', 'exciting', '2', 'half', 'hours', 'One', 'student', 'Negro', 'who', 'Kent', 'State', 'Ohio', 'also', 'member', 'National', 'Guard', 'avoid', 'service', 'Vietnam', 'also', 'help', 'pay', 'tuition', 'when', 'called', 'service', 'antiwar', 'mobs', 'first', 'set', 'fire', 'ROTC', 'building', 'deaths', '4', 'college', 'kids', 'hands', 'fellow', 'trigger-happy', 'weekend', 'warriors', 'Guard', 'movie', 'theater', 'attended', 'kid', 'time', 'Black', 'Nationalist', 'headquarters', 'certain', 'meetings', 'later', 'marries', 'older', 'woman', 'child', 'who', 'lost', 'husband', 'war', 'also', 'betrayed', 'close', 'friend', 'resulting', 'near-death', 'nice', 'Mustang', 'being', 'totaled', 'Yowch', 'Amy', 'Smart', 'college', 'girls', 'who', 'boyfriend', 'Kent', 'State', 'well', 'college', 'kind', 'puttering', 'life', 'numerous', 'jobs', 'new', 'boyfriend', 'who', 'recording', 'studio', 'coming', 'blows', 'later', 'realizing', 'grief', 'when', 'apologize', 'finding', 'out', 'killed', 'OD', 'drugs', 'while', 'can', 'recover', 'true', 'belief', 'trying', 'express', 'wacko', 'cult', 'point', 'where', ""n't"", 'know', 'own', 'name', 'parents', 'own', 'friends', 'are', 'forced', 'kidnap', 'cult', 'house', 'try', 'reprogram', 'back', 'old', 'life.This', 'girl', 'best', 'friend', 'Eileen', 'who', 'Kent', 'State', 'bloody', 'day', 'May', '1970', 'moves', 'New', 'York', 'City', 'hoping', 'put', 'skills', 'work', 'there', 'new', 'roommate', 'one', 'kooky', 'feminist-rights', 'women', 'who', 'meetings', 'apartments', 'also', 'backlashes', 'Eileen', 'first', 'day', 'realizing', 'Eileen', 'mother', 'still', 'homemaker', 'choice', 'Eileen', 'soon', 'dismayed', 'decision', 'parents', 'divorce', 'avoids', 'mother', 'when', 'new', 'boyfriend', 'taking', 'side', 'father', 'result', 'Unable', 'find', 'job', 'opening', 'true', 'calling', 'reluctantly', 'job', 'secretary', 'advertising', 'firm', 'hoping', 'raise', 'up', 'ranks', 'giving', 'boss', 'many', 'good', 'ideas', 'certain', 'assignments', 'full', 'credit', 'years', 'going', 'losing', 'open', 'position', 'job', 'earned', 'candidate', 'who', 'scarcely', 'qualified', 'lawsuit', 'sexual', 'indiscrimination', 'company', 'heartbreaking', 'testimony', 'fellow', 'secretary', 'who', 'had', 'been', 'position', '20', 'years', 'lawsuit', 'finally', 'dream', 'position', 'end', 'company.The', 'last', 'character', 'guy', 'who', 'Amy', 'Smart', 'brother', 'also', 'secretly', 'love', 'Eileen', 'entire', 'time', 'parents', 'are', 'dismayed', 'idea', 'quit', 'law', 'school', 'are', 'overjoyed', 'when', 'find', 'out', 'job', 'offer', 'taking', 'work', 'government', 'Washington', 'huge', 'part', 'giving', 'out', 'plans', 'Democratic', 'Headquarters', 'Building', 'government', 'officials', 'election', '1972', 'soon', 'scandal', 'Watergate', 'crisis', 'soon', 'subpoenaed', 'testify', 'hia', 'involvement', 'Watergate', 'thereby', 'losing', 'job', 'aide', 'White', 'House', 'Nixon', 'resigns', 'Unable', 'grasp', 'reputation', 'soon', 'exile', 'out', 'oil', 'pipeline', 'worker', 'Alaska', 'government', 'affect', 'wildlife', 'there', 'Alaska', 'Several', 'times', 'get', 'Eileen', 'much', 'success', 'get', 'married', 'last', 'scene', 'movie.I', 'enjoyed', 'very', 'much', 'will', 'be', 'referring', 'friends', 'coworkers']",N/A
