Shannen Doherty left the show and a new character was introduced, Valerie Malone. The character of Valerie was played by Saved By the Bell's Tiffani Amber Thessian who just happened to be dating Brian Austin Green at the time. Her character is anything but a sweetheart, she's cold, aloof, and deeply troubled. There are some great gems this season, in season six through 10 the show dipped but I stayed a loyal viewer throughout. My favorite character was Kelly Taylor played by Jennie Garth, she always brought warmth and sensitivity to that role, love her!

1158011,A1PASRZ81DY9C,B0017VG67M,Austin Somlo,"[0, 4]","Not as dramatic as the past season, Beverly Hills 90210: Season Five was still addicting to watch as usual. I didn't have a particular favorite of any episode during the season, and I thought that some of them in Beverly Hills 90210: Season Five have become unrealistic in the worst way possible. Now, let's get started with the characters of the cast. Brandon Walsh...ah, yes...the inveterate hypocrite. Of course, I've written before that politics was so him last season, and he showed his true colors as well in season five. Speaking of unrealistic, Brandon Walsh managed to get away with his traffic stop bust in the final episode when he was an underage drinker, in possession of a joint (regardless of the fact he wasn't smoking it), and already had prior (should have) convictions of DUI and reckless driving. There was no wonder why the writers want the audience to believe that Brandon is on his way to sainthood (yeah, right). Then, he cheated on his girlfriend Kelly Taylor by staying over the night with Emily Valentine (Ugh...what's with her hairdo? Bring back the yellow, please.) during the night of the fire at the party house. Finally, in the end, he pressured Kelly to marry him before they are both 21 years old. When Kelly rejected his proposal, Brandon turned down a relationship with Kelly for gosh-knows-what-reasons and ended up necking with the ever bad girl Valerie Malone. Ew...but very realistic for him though. Moving on to Valerie Malone, played by the newcomer Tiffani-Amber Thiessen...now what would Zack Morris think of? It was a shock at first for many viewers accustomed to seeing her as the always nice, beautiful Kelly Kapowski from Saved by the Bell, but she really did an awesome job shedding away the perfect image of herself and becoming the worst enemy possible in Beverly Hills 90210: Season Five. Of course, she was also an enigma...at times, you like her, and then, she does the 180 degree in an instant. I have to say that she is a girl of many talents, meaning that she could have made things easier if she would find a rich guy in Beverly Hills and marry him for the money. As far as to the end of season five, I am very confused about her motives, but does it have anything to do with the suicide of her father? We shall see in next season. By the way, I am very disappointed that she got her name in the opening credits right away when Joe Tata, working on the show for four seasons, was still not in there yet. Elsewhere, Kelly Taylor made her case for being the most likeable character of the show, and she had matured the most. I found her intelligent yet confused about her identity, and her way of dealing with issues around her had made the show highly interesting to watch. She made the right choice by turning down Dylan and Brandon; she deserved better, and neither deserved her. I was pleasantly surprised in one episode when she confessed to Donna that Dylan ""is one of the most self-centered people on the planet Earth and according to him, he's been that way for several lifetimes."" I couldn't agree with her more. That will always stand out of the best lines of the entire show. Dylan McKay...what can I say? He certainly made the show interesting as well...but he had to be the dumbest of all characters with probably an exception of Donna Martin. Sure, he reads literature and quotes lines from poems, but he doesn't come across to me as an intellectual. Far from it. The sanest thing he could have made with his life is to sell the house, move out of Beverly Hills, and live somewhere else in a quiet existence. The only rational reason for his depression and getting into alcohol and drug fueled binge is because he was facing the possibility of having to work for the rest of his life (aw, poor Dylanie, too over-privileged, ain't he?). Speaking of intellectuals, how about Brandon attempting to make into Jeopardy!? *blows raspberries* yeah right...he didn't even know what the Mendoza Line (a very common term) was. That's another case of character manipulation. Poor Donna, she hadn't changed much except for her wardrobe. She is a very nice girl, but in some of the outfits she wore, she dressed practically like a hooker and was one step away from patrolling Sunset Strip and asking Johns to pick her up. Honestly, nobody ever in her right mind would wear such clothes like them for regular outings. Her relationship with Ray Pruit had grown tiresome and didn't result in a breakup after the end of Beverly Hills 90210: Season Five. Jamie Walters' character is a sad case of character manipulation as he was portrayed as an abusive boyfriend and a cheater. For somebody from the wrong side of the tracks, it would be nice to show him as a honest, decent person just for once. He was actually that way from the beginning until things started to go very wrong. Nonetheless, I agreed a lot with what Ray Pruit had been saying all along, and it can be very tedious to date a girl who seemed to be married to her friends. Worse than that, it can be extremely impossible to have a relationship with a girl who vowed celibacy until marriage. That's just not possible in late 20th century while everybody is in prime of their lives. Moreover, it doesn't help matters any if Donna keeps dressing like a hooker. Her mother may have topped Brenda Walsh as the most hated character of the series. The moment that she was bringing up the interracial mix with D'Shawn, my eyes literally rolled. Then, it got worse when she attempted to pay Ray off. It's easy to see how Donna is being controlled by her mother. Steve Sanders, nothing is ever new with him. He is the same old himself. I still like him regardless of the million faults he has accrued over the years. Good going for Jesse to set Steve straight after telling a story of how the system works for some and not for others. Pretty selfish of Steve to think he got robbed of his silly ambitions. Beverly Hills 90210: Season Five is the final one for four characters: Andrea Zuckerman, Jesse Vasquez, and Cindy and Jim Walsh. I never cared for nor liked Andrea, and I found her full of herself. It's like...give her an issue, and she'll go nuts about it. Too much for me. She was also a hypocrite just like his pal Brandon. Her marriage should have died after she cheated on Jesse, and she didn't deserve him. As for Jesse, I liked him a lot, and now, for the unrealistic part thrown in by the writers for the sake of leverage, I was appalled by the character manipulation by making Jesse an equally culpable member for having committed adultery. I will not believe that for a second because hadn't he done it, that makes Andrea to be the bad person, and deservingly so, in the relationship. Thus, the divorce will be a fait accompli. At the rate Jesse was going by with his work, it was very evident that his mind was on building up his family while undertaking a very serious step forward with his career. That always happens, and he is too busy to be doing something so silly as to sleep with somebody else at that critical juncture of his life. Cindy and Jim Walsh, too bad...it's over for them. They were easily my favorite characters of Beverly Hills 90210, and they were excellent in their roles. Just perfect. Too bad they didn't get the chance to punish their children the way they deserved to be. Oh...I haven't mentioned Brenda Walsh. Who cares? Good riddance. David, hm...nothing changes about him. He is boring as usual. Ditto for Clare. I think the only reason why she got on the show is because of her overdone lips. Other than that, she had a horrible snobbish attitude that I found it unpleasant to watch. Speaking of cheating, that aspect was way overplayed throughout the entire season of Beverly Hills 90210: Season Five. That's when the show started to lose a lot of credibility. The probability of seeing so many characters cheating on the significant other was too high for a series that it became too unrealistic. Let's keep track of who was cheating on who: Dylan on Brenda with Kelly, Kelly on Dylan with Brandon, David on Donna with Ariel, Donna on Ray with Griffin and also on Griffin with Ray, Donna on Ray with Brandon (now...what was that??? Ray would have blown three fuses in his mind had he knew about the scene for the Valentine telethon), Brandon on Kelly with Donna, Brandon on Kelly with Emily, Ray on Donna with Valerie, Cindy on Jim with a photographer (can't remember his name), Steve on Celeste with a Date Rape accuser (can't remember her name either), Andrea on Dan Rubin with Jesse, Andrea on Jesse with Peter, Brenda on Dylan with Rick, and Valerie on everybody with everybody else. Ridiculous. Speaking of that, what a waste of time to watch Dylan's dreams. They were useless and didn't amount to anything in the end because we already knew that he always wanted Kelly. Now, for Brandon acting as the president of the student population at California University....I've attended many schools in the past decade, but not one of them that I found the student president an important person. And I knew neither the name of one in any school. Incorrectly in one of the episodes of season five, no student president has a say when it comes to tuition rate in any college; that's up to the board of trustees and/or whoever else with authority. As for the ""brainwashing"" part with Kelly Taylor and New Evolution, I thought what she was doing was fine, but the one she was in that was found to be a fraud shouldn't have deterred her from looking for another program, a safer one. She was still traumatized about what happened to her and Allison in the fire. I noticed how religious season five had gotten, and I was getting nauseous during them. Tone it down, please. One episode that I found the most dramatic of season five was the fire where Kelly and Allison were trapped in the basement. As I know that they got very scared, they should have thought of splashing water into themselves and soaking their clothes from the sink, if the shower wasn't there on the left side of them (I couldn't see it; if there was one, take off the clothes and stay in the shower, running cold water on themselves the entire time until the firemen come). That would have been a huge help for them as far as being inflamed goes. Despite the many negatives of the show, I really found the handling of the many characters in so many parallel ways genius and clever and the storylines to be the best feature. They were so interesting that the series ended up to be addicting to watch. I am glad they had recurring characters, but the show remains too white for me. Speaking of whiteness, I think it was demeaning that the writers still portrayed many characters, especially Jesse, of different races to be flawed in a bad way. There must be plenty of characters, white or not, that are really good people, and I am not seeing it that much in season five. I am starting to notice the fashion on many characters, and I liked them all save a few. Ray's choice of wardrobe is pretty good and interesting to me, not too flashy but simple. Some of the episodes are annoying in the DVD because of the cut out scenes, most notably Jamie Walters' music. It is always so remarkable to me how well every character has recovered from any dramatic episode in their lives and never be in state of depression, further heightening the lack of realism of the show. One more great scene occurs when Brandon and Dylan are invited into a sweat lodge with Native Americans. That ranks among the best scenes. Speaking of musicians, as soon as I saw Jade in one episode, I admit...I've never heard of them before and don't see them as a popular band. All in all, Beverly Hills 90210: Season Five is addicting to watch but is losing steam with unrealistic set ups of subplots.",4,Addicting as Usual But Unrealistic.,1292198400,"12 13,

There's smarmy politico, Brandon Walsh, one time party girl, turned stick-in-the-mud priss, Kelly Taylor, Mickey Rourke wannabe Dylan McKay, fool's fool Steve Sanders, gawky rapper turned videographer David, boring self righteous Andrea and her even more boring husband and yet even more boring baby, weiner-tease Donna Martin, and of course...Nat, who in all likelyhood, is only a few years older than the rest of the cast.The newcomers are slutty basket case Valerie, one note (and a false note at that) Ray Pruit, and Claire (she was around the previous season actually, but who's counting?) Much happens this year, Dylan lost all his dough, which causes his posture to sink and his hairline to recede, and he spends most of his time drinking coffee when he's not chasing the dragon or shooting plastic skeletons. Brandon becomes school president after his running mate gets burned alive in a car accident. And like most university class presidents, he must face down anti-semitism, and torturing dictators from other countries. The name of this country is Selenisia, where they tortured school custodians in the name of democracy. Do not cry for them though, I am quite certain Selenisia doesn't exist.Speaking of getting burned alive...Kelly gets, well, burned alive. Not her face. Her arm and neck mostly. Sadly, the stick that seems to have been placed up her keyster this season does not go up in flames. Oh yeah, she joins a cult too.Valerie was a good idea to bring on the show, but why Claire? She's as dull as one of Andrea's dishrags. I also forgot to mention, Casper Van Dien shows up and gives a very convincing performance...as a Macy's mannequin. And then there's Ray Pruit (his mom could only afford one T) the musician with the personality of a boom mic. Which brings me to, the boom mic! Every once in a while, it just kind of appears, much like all the parents on this show. Just kind of shows up and then goes away. God bless it.My favorite episode? The Real World one. It is so astonishingly, brilliantly, flabberghastingly awful, it summizes why I love watching the show in the first place.

1158016,A2NKXXWUY2R41E,B0017VG67M,"Fjireland ""fjireland""","[0, 0]","I recently picked up this set of 90210 and enjoyed reliving it for the first time since it went off air back in 2000. I wasn't a die hard fan of the show back in the day but I did watch quite regularly... really I was more into Melrose place, 90210's sister show. Still, I did watch this show regularly...The early years of the show (seasons 1-4) were huge culture events for young people all over the world in the 90's, they struck a chord because of the willingness to tackle many issues ... drugs, alcohol, etc. Whilst I did watch the show during these seasons , I really enjoyed watching the show more in the later years ... starting with this season, my first to purchase on dvd.This season saw a shift from being a little on the preachy, educational side in the early years to a more entertaining (for me anyway) melodrama, the focus was less on issues and more on relationships this year... a lot of people didn't like this switching of gears. But I did, and if you liked the more soapy feel of later 90210, then you will enjoy this season for sure..We knew the characters so well by now having watched them grow in previous seasons and we really cared about them as an audience, they all had that likeability factor that is crucial to any hit show. So, it was nice to see the characters blossom further this year in preparation for the real world after college.Shaneen Doherty had been fired after year 4, but my they struck gold with the introduction of bad girl Valerie this year, she was edgier and more entertaining to watch than spoilt Brenda ever was. Valerie was developed slowly this season and it was a hoot to watch her pretending to be nicey-nice at first to the walshes and the gang before becoming a bitch that you actually rooted for in ways.. she was the new star of the show.As for the rest of the gang, donna developed nicely pursuing new relationships with guys like griffin and ray... having moved on from david, david coupled up with Clare Arnold  and the two were a welcome comedic duo, clare has many great lines... steve was steve... moving from one hair brained idea/ scheme to the next, Brandon remained the moral anchor of the show and his relationship with Kelly was only starting out, Dylan went off the rails then back on them and spent the rest of the season pining in the background for Kelly, Andrea and jessy were doomed from the start and drifted apart slowly before bowing out of the show , also cindy and jim depart by season end.All in all, this season is a good buy, it's light and fluffy in many ways, the odd issue crops up here and there and is played out  through character's dilemmas  but mostly its just nice to relive the stories/lives of old faces that we knew and loved.(By the way, a lot of people complained that the music has been changed in many episodes, I didn't notice honestly , it definitely didn't effect my enjoyment of the show).

1158017,A3MQ672FYFNM7B,B0017VG67M,JGC,"[30, 49]","Bleach Blondes... Boyish Bachelors... Beaches... Big B00bs... & Brenda, Brenda, Brenda!!! ...it's Beverly Hills!Growing up I was such a huge fan of ""90210."" This was the only show (besides ""Melrose Place"") that I watched religiously, week in and week out. By Season 5 the show was a huge worldwide hit because fans all over the world tuned in to watch. But, sadly, this was also the season when ""90210"" jumped the shark.Without Shannen the series did not have it's spark and it's chemistry. Shannen/Brenda was such a powerful enigmatic force that caused such a phenomenon because everyone had such a strong opinion of her. There have even been entire books written about the fascination with her (the ""I Hate Brenda Book"" comes to mind.) Shannen was like the Madonna of ""90210."" So, I suppose it was inevitable that they would all turn on her. Isn't that what always happens to those who are at the top of their game?After Shannen was fired, the series took on a new ""direction"" with new cast members and less theatrical storylines. Season 5 was the beginning of the end as far as this classic series is concerned. I stopped watching ""90210"" I guess about a year after Shannen left because I could not relate to any of the other characters. None of them had that charisma, beauty, and talent of Brenda. (By Season 6, I was actually routing for that kook Tara, when she took super-priss Kelly Taylor hostage in that nonsensical ""Single White Female"" rip-off.)Tori Spelling got incredibly annoying during Season 5. It was like the bigger her b00bs got and the more she bleached her hair the stupider she became. She almost reminded me of Chrissy from ""Three's Company,"" although I don't think even Chrissy Snow was that utterly dumb. I also hated all those stupid temper-tantrums she would have because it was so childish; although it was rather dramatic and funny to watch the Beverly Hills Princess as she became unraveled.These are the Season 5 Cast Members:*** Shannen-The Star-Doherty ~ Brenda Walsh  (I know by Season 5 Shannen is gone, I just wanted to include this to plss off everyone who hates her. LOL)*** Jason Priestley ~ Brandon Walsh*** Luke Perry ~ Dylan McKay*** Jennie Garth ~ Kelly the ice-princess Taylor*** Tori Spelling ~ Donna Martin*** Ian Ziering ~ Steve Sanders*** Brian Green ~ David Silver*** Kathleen Robertson ~ Clare Arnold*** Ann Gillespie ~ Jackie the reformed cokehead Taylor*** Tiffani Thiessen ~ Valerie Malone*** James Eckhouse ~ Jim Walsh*** Carol Potter ~ Cindy Walsh*** Gabrielle Carteris ~ Andrea Zuckerman-Vasquez*** Joe E. Tata ~ Nat Bussichio*** Jamie Walters ~ Ray Pruit*** Mark D. Espinoza ~ Jesse the token minority VasquezDylan was also very annoying during Season 5. Wasn't he so incredibly hungry for attention? And when all the hairball things he did didn't work he would get so upset. Wasn't it David that once called him a ""sanctimonious pain in the a-s-s...?"" That describes Mr. McKay perfectly because by Season 5 he was a grotesque and shocking picture of his former outrageous self. Even after he ""cleaned up his act"" he was still boring and not much to look at. (The only good thing about Season 6 is that by then the writers couldn't keep coming up with more foolish stories for him so he takes a hike!)Who did I like from Season 5? Can you say Brenda Walsh... OK, besides her. Let's see... Ummmmm. Oh, I know. Steve Sanders. Steve is so funny because he never changed and never grew up. And wasn't Ian Ziering totally the Ringo of the group? I always felt bad for him because you could just tell that he got their sloppy seconds (and was glad to get it.) But Steve was cool because he didn't put on airs like the others and he didn't try to be anything but what he was. When I see Ian on Dancing With The Stars, I can't get into him because I still see Steve Sanders.Season Five Eps:What I Did on My Summer Vacation and Other Stories 9/7/1994Bren is nowhere to be found, you see, she stays in London! Val is the new member of the Walsh Home who takes her room, but not her place!Under the Influence 9/14/1994Dylan makes a scene at a splashy engagement that the whole gang is at. Meanwhile, &Uuml;berbigot, Felice (Katherine Cannon) goes nuts when Donna dances with D'Shawn Hardell (Cress Williams) (a black dude!)A Clean Slate 9/21/1994Alex Diaz (F.J. Rio) theatens to expose Brandon if he doesn't back out of the election. Bran wins the election only to find out that his running mate has been run over and killed! Dylan is stunned to learn that his new leap-frog partner is living at the Walsh Home!Life After Death 9/28/1994The new CU President helps Steve out of a pickle at the KEG House. Felice sets up Donna with a friend's son. And, surprise, surprise he's white!!Rave On 10/5/1994Kelly starts shooting her (big) mouth off about Valerie. Meanwhile, Andrea gets her nose out of joint when her hubby is seen flirting on the job.Homecoming 10/12/1994A head of an oppressive state comes to CU. Brandon is urged to protest his visit. Meanwhile, Ray and Donna work at his family's pumpkin patch.Who's Zoomin' Who? 10/19/1994The Peach Pit is closed. Valerie runs her mouth about Dylan's money problems and as usual Jim Walsh can't keep his nose out of Dylan's affairs. I love how Dylan tells him to go scratch.Things That Go Bang in the Night 10/26/1994Valerie learns that her mother's been admitted to a hospital because of mental issues!Intervention 11/2/1994The entire gang holds an ""intervention"" for down in the dumps Dylan. Mackenzie Phillips (Julie from ""One Day At a Time"") has a bit part as Counselor Ellen Marks. I love when Steve barks to Dylan: you're not worth the bottle you're trying to crawl out of. So funny and true!The Dreams of Dylan McKay 11/9/1994An entire ep is devoted to Dylan's dementia. Maybe we'll all get lucky and these DVDs will be the syndicated eps!Hate Is Just a Four-Letter Word 11/16/1994Brandon has to decide what to do when a controversial speaker wants to come to CU. When pushy Andrea throws her hat into the fire, the ep really starts to get good! I love it when that totally ghetto girl calls Andrea a b-i-t-ch. And Zuckerman says ""I don't need that"" in her snobbish Beverly Hills tone that she's now famous for.The Voodoo That You Do So Well (also known as Rock of Ages) 11/23/1994This is one of the better eps of the Season. Includes live clips at a Rolling Stones Concert (who knew that rich kids from Beverly Hills liked the Stones?)Up in Flames 11/30/1994Emily Valentine (Christine Elise McCarthy) comes into town for a brief visit with Bran. Meanwhile Kelly is caught in a fire with another girl!Injustice for All 12/14/1994Kelly suffers second degree burns but still manages to make sure that her hair and makeup looks picture-perfect.Christmas Comes This Time Each Year 12/21/1994Cindy and Jim go visit Bren for Christmas (wouldn't it have been great if they would have really done a show like that?) Felice pays Ray 10G to stay away from Donna, but after another one of her crying-fits Donna decides to use the money to send LuAnne (Caroline McWilliams) on a cruise.Sentenced to Life 1/4/1995Steve is stuck working at a retirement village. Mr. Television has a guest role.Sweating It Out 1/11/1995Bran and Dylan go on a road trip. Meanwhile, Donna tries to help Ray get over his stage fright.Hazardous to Your Health 1/18/1995Dylan goes to Punta Brava to meet ""Jonesy"" (Wings Hauser,) an informent that he hired to catch Suzanne (Kerrie Keane) and Kevin (David Hayward.) Valerie was so pathetic in this ep. When Dylan calls her she goes running like a little lapdog. With perhaps his only clever remark, Jim Walsh says to Cindy ""she has no shame."" I also thought the entire subplot concerning Erica (Noley Thornton) was so pathetic. Even if her mother and step-father were crooks doesn't mean that Dylan had any right to steal her away; can you say ""kidnap?"" And he doesn't even take her in, instead he dumps her off with Iris because as he put it (in the next ep) ""the two hit it off."" ...Oh yea, I bet any woman would jump at the chance to babysit her ex-hubby's child that he had out of wedlock!Little Monsters 2/1/1995Kelly becomes more and more involved with Findley's Group. Dylan pays Val $10,000.00 for her effort but she's not happy with that and runs to ""Jonesy"" for some more dough.You Gotta Have Heart  2/8/1995The gang put on a Valentine's Day benefit at the new After Dark Club. After prudish Donna rejects him, Ray gets luckier with Val.Stormy Weather 2/15/1995Dylan helps Bran with Kelly. Ray ends his sex-sessions with Val. Meanwhile, Andrea is enjoying her own sex-sessions with a married medical student.Alone at the Top 2/22/1995Tongues wag when it's announced that Val's the new owner of the Club.  Steve's a little ticked off until Rush (Jed Allen) gives him some hush-money.Love Hurts 3/1/1995David's sleaze-ball friend Lenny (Tracy Fraim) is released from questioning. Donna is almost attacked when a kook gets her keys and sneaks into the beach house apartment!Unreal World 3/15/1995David and Clare film the gang in an apparent ""Real World"" knock-off.Double Jeopardy 3/29/1995Jesse moves out. Meanwhile, David goes with Donna to Portland in the hopes of seeing his estranged mother.A Song for My Mother 4/5/1995This is one of my favorite eps of the Season. Ray gets rough with Donna and pushes her around because he's furious that David came along. David finally finds Sheila (Caroline Lagerfelt) who apparently forgot to take her lithium.Squash It 4/12/1995Steve and David put together a rhythm and blues night at the After Dark. Meanwhile Ju'wan (don't you just love that name?) (Vicellous Reon Shannon) makes some waves and learns that violence isn't the answer to solve his problems.Girls on the Side 5/3/1995The ice-princess is down in the dumps when she's the Seventeen Magazine covergirl.The Real McCoy 5/10/1995Another ludicrous ep dedicated to Dylan's narcissism. Under hypnosis, he learns that a lady who looks exactly like Kelly Taylor was his lover during a past life. YAWN...Hello Life, Goodbye Beverly Hills 5/17/1995...Ding-dong the witch is gone! The gang hold a going-away party for Andrea at West Beverly. I love when Ray sarcastically says to Donna ""how many times are you going to say goodbye to her."" Kelly and Bran breakup when she can't choose between him and Dylan. Only a girl like Kelly Taylor would let 2 great guys like that slip through her fingers!P.S. I Love You 5/24/1995Cindy and Jim take off for Hong Kong. The gang all go to Palm Springs for a KEG event. Brandon tags along because he's still hurt about the breakup. Meanwhile, Ray gets violent (once again) with Donna and pushes her down the stairs at the resort! ...Dylan is threatened by some men who claim that they knew who blew up Jack McKay. This is a 2-hour ep that airs in 2 parts during syndication.""90210"" Season 5 taught me 1 very important message. I learned that there are 2 types of people in this world. Those who Love Shannen Doherty and those who Loath her.

There are songs that are different, and some that are just cut out.  Even scenes are cut out, and some are interrupted in the middle and then the end is just sort of attached, which makes it very confusing if you haven't seen it before.  Now I'm unsure if I ought to bother purchasing anymore seasons because it's such a waste of money. Although I do have the last season, and it seems to be intact- so I probably will take the chance.

All they did was argue and there were like 1 or 2 times they were actually happy. Im not even sure they went through one episode without fighting.When Season 5 came along and get Brenda the hell out of there they finally got serious.

I was a sophmore in high school when they were, at the shows start, and we were the same age and we grew up together. I watched (and taped) every episode for the whole 10 years... but those VHS tapes wear out, so imagine my joy when the DVD set came out... or not...As I said, I have taped every episode, and I watch it now on Soapnet... and as you know like watching your favorite movie over and over, you can ""talk along with the movie""... well I am that way with this show. I now know (but didn't until after having bought the first 2 seasons) that the box says in fine print on the back of the box that ""MUSIC HAS BEEN CHANGED FOR THIS HOME ENTERTAINMENT VERSION. SOME EPISODES MAY BE EDITED FROM THEIR ORIGINAL NETWORK VERSIONS."", but come on!!! I noticed a wierd edit in another season episode and a spot here and there, not to mention in season one when all the girls have a slumber party and are signing along to ""Mony Mony"" but now the music is different... but The Senior Prom episode was seriously butchered! There were major parts gone... not to mention Cathy Dennis sang 2 songs at the prom and they cut the whole second song out, along with shots of her and most of the actors lines that were said during that song. I am very disappointed in this. The prom episode was a great one, not to mention a pivital part of the season. Part of the greatness of 90210 was the fact that they used new, up to date music for every episode.Come on FOX... how cheap are you? We are all paying $40 or more for a set that probably costs $5 to make... You couldn't shell out some cash to keep this amazingly cool show intact in it's original condition??? And what are you going to do in future seasons??? There were tons of episodes later on in the Peach Pit After Dark where a famous music group plays there... are those hour long episodes going to be edited down to a half hour show?So, before you start sending me hate email, let me say this:My review comes to this = Yes, I love the show and Yes, I have and probably will buy every season on DVD. But Yes, I am disappointed in the editing. So to all of you die hard fans like me... be aware of this before you buy and watch it, so you aren't completly disappointed like I was when I first bought and watched them. Maybe they will get this figured out and stop their ""editing"" or ""ruining"" our favorite show!!!***Ok, if you read alot of reviews... you may recognize I wrote this above exact review above for season 3. Well, my questions were answered. I am watching season 5 now, and the group Jade made an appearance. Yes, they did show them sing one song, but they cut out all of the other spots in the show where they appeared. Not to mention that the Ray Pruet character sang on the show quite a bit, but so far thru disc 6 I have not heard one note... one episode they cut almost 5 minutes of an episode just to avoid showing him singing. This is getting ridiculous... should we be boycotting? Maybe we all should just stop buying these DVD's and watch the reruns on soapnet until they quit messing up our show and put the full versions out for all of us hard core fans!
