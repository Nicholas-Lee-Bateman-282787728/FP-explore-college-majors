978206,A3C2HQOFO37TFN,B000ERVJMC,Pamela Walters,"[2, 2]","Macgyver really did a lot of changing over the years, and I liked how it changed from him being a sort of super secret agent, to doing more serious kind of work with the environment. I loved the early episodes, but I found it took a year or two for the episodes to get really good. The addition of the Murdoc character I think was the start of where the show took off for me. It's what really captured my interest. I mean what show out there had an unarmed man that could get out of pretty much any situation with whatever he had with him in the room, like Duct Tape, or a paper clip, or whatever?This show was definitely one of a kind. I do kind of miss the early days of the show because those little ways he would get out of danger really defined the show, and it seemed like they wanted to back away from those things in the later seasons. I think the stories got way better in this season. For Instance, the episode called The Visitors, which is about Aliens. It's a really good episode, and shows you how a hoax can be made, etc. I really liked it a lot. My favourite episode in this season was the return of Murdoc in the 3rd last episode. I always love when he comes back.The only complaint I have about the later seasons of Macgyver was the fact that it was shot in Canada, I think they used a lot of Canadian producers, etc and it really made the show look low budget, from the camera shots to the way the show was shot. It didn't look as good as in the early seasons.But I will judge the set by the episodes, and all that only, and say that this set deserves 5 stars.

MacGyver's Women 11/12/90Macgyver's reluctance to commit to a permanent relationship causes him to dream an Old West scenario where he defends three of his lady friends from some ornery outlaws as he drives their wagon cross country.9.) Bitter Harvest 11/19/90MacGyver goes undercover to investigate the death of a farm-worker organizer during an investigation of illegal pesticide use.10.) The Visitor 12/3/90While out of town to help with a new hospital,Macgyver is witness to a UFO sighting,complete with strange crop circles in a farmer's field. He decides to investigate,and he uncovers a scam with the help of his new friends. A young boy named Tommy Wiley,and Phil Sternwise,a mysterious man who says he's only a salesman....11.) Squeeze Play 12/17/90Mac defends a former player's daughter being blackmailed by a baseball memorabilia-counterfeiting ring trading on her father's name.12.) Jericho Games 1/7/91Mac is reunited with a high school sweetheart whose husband is a wealthy man sponsoring an international sports competition.13.)

Eye of Orisis 2/4/91Mac helps out on an archeological dig for the tomb of Alexander the Great, but the expedition seems to be followed by bad luck. Several incidents nearly cause a shutdown. Then Mac finds clues leading to Alex's tomb. Unfortunately, the accidents are not coincidental, and they meet a very vengeful man who traps them inside the grave...15.) High Control 2/11/91Mac tries to help an acquaintance just out of prison stay on the straight and narrow despite the efforts of his old biker gang to blackmail him into rejoining them.16.) There But For the Grace 2/18/91Mac feels a personal involvement in the death of a priest who worked among the homeless and takes to the streets himself to find the killer.17.) Blind Faith 3/4/91An old sweetheart of Pete Thornton's appeals to him for help when she tries to reveal the atrocities being committed in her Latin American homeland.

Knowing that MacGyver is the only contract that he failed to execute, Murdocs agrees to ""clear"" his otherwise perfect record. MacGyver, returning home one night, finds Murdoc waiting for him at his dinner table- with dinner waiting. Murdoc sets MacGyver up for execution and forces MacGyver to admit defeat to him- or be killed via cyanide. After that, Murdoc warns MacGyver of his intention to kill him and then leaves. MacGyver knows the professional killer is not bluffing- and he knows he will use anybody and do anything to get to him...20.) Trial of Tears 4/26/91A land dispute over the building an electricity station pits a fanatical Native American, convinced he has been given a mission by his spiritual ancestors, against the power company and MacGyver, who's just as sure that the Indian spirits are opposed to the man's violent plans.21.) Hind-Sight 5/6/91As Pete waits for glaucoma surgery, he and MacGyver reminisce about their past adventures and try to figure out who has been sending some vaguely threatening messages to Pete.Look for season 7 the final season of MacGyver which is the best season IMO this fall to complete the Macgyver Series.",4,Season 6.

978209,APQ1MTXAN2M8N,B000ERVJMC,Rebel G.,"[3, 3]","My family loves and enjoys MacGyver so much.  This season, however, was a rollercoaster ride of good and bad episodes.  It seemed like every other episode was a save the environment episode and that it didn't stay true to what makes MacGyver such a classic and lovable tv show...MacGyverisms.Don't get me wrong; there were a number of great episodes. But the moments of constant we need to save this piece of land and oh, I hate my dad, but by the end of the episode it's all...I'm sorry you were just misunderstood...  Some of it was too unrealistic and left me feeling unsatisfied.Perhaps after six seasons Macgyver has lost it's initial appeal for me or maybe the writers just wanted to make a political statement.
