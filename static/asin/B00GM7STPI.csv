1678810,A2OLT21YBUKGTC,B00GM7STPI,Anne Lee,"[1, 3]","I hadn't planned to watch this movie but I gave in to my curiosity.  I should have stuck to my original plan and skipped this poorly acted, unbelievable romance between Diana, Princess of Wales and Hasnat Klan, a Pakistani cardiologist,  Naomi Watts didn't  look, talk or share any physical characteristics except for short blond hair with Diana. If we are to believe this movie, Diana was selfish, egocentric and dumb enough to believe a divorced Christian women would be accepted as the bride to a devote Islamic man.I don't doubt Diana had an affair with Klan since she admitted to romances that occurred while she was still married to Prince Charles. I don't think the romance was the solution to all of Diana's problems including her abandonment issues that resulted from her parents divorce and compounded by Charles' ongoing affair with Parker-Bowles or taught her how to use her celebrity status to bring attention to matters of importance i.e. land mines. Years of a royal marriage had taught Diana how to manipulate the press to her advantage not Klan as the movie suggests. I'm sure Diana was neither a perfect saint  nor the completely selfish woman who is quoted in this movie saying &#34;I am a princess who gets what she wants &#34;. Neither Hasnat Klan nor the actor who portrayed him in the movie is a &#34;gorgeous creature&#34; Diana couldn't resist.  I truly doubt Klan was a love-sick doctor who fought the crowds in order to leave flowers (along side the thousands left by the public) and a poem promising to find Diana in the after live. Diana, the movie, is an embarrassment for the actors, writers and producers.  If the idea was to portray Diana as a selfish woman who stalked  a man after he ended their relationship, then it was a success. Regardless of her faults, Diana and her surviving children deserve better than this pitiful and obviously inaccurate movie.",2,A Waste of Time and Money,1392422400,"02 15, 2014",2014,1891,"['had', ""n't"", 'planned', 'watch', 'movie', 'gave', 'curiosity', 'should', 'have', 'stuck', 'original', 'plan', 'skipped', 'poorly', 'acted', 'unbelievable', 'romance', 'Diana', 'Princess', 'Wales', 'Hasnat', 'Klan', 'Pakistani', 'cardiologist', 'Naomi', 'Watts', 'did', ""n't"", 'look', 'talk', 'share', 'physical', 'characteristics', 'short', 'blond', 'hair', 'Diana', 'are', 'believe', 'movie', 'Diana', 'was', 'selfish', 'egocentric', 'dumb', 'enough', 'believe', 'divorced', 'Christian', 'women', 'would', 'be', 'accepted', 'bride', 'devote', 'Islamic', 'man.I', 'do', ""n't"", 'doubt', 'Diana', 'had', 'affair', 'Klan', 'admitted', 'romances', 'occurred', 'was', 'still', 'married', 'Prince', 'Charles', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'romance', 'was', 'solution', 'Diana', 'problems', 'including', 'abandonment', 'issues', 'resulted', 'parents', 'divorce', 'compounded', 'Charles', 'ongoing', 'affair', 'Parker-Bowles', 'taught', 'how', 'use', 'celebrity', 'status', 'bring', 'attention', 'matters', 'importance', 'i.e', 'land', 'mines', 'Years', 'royal', 'marriage', 'had', 'taught', 'Diana', 'how', 'manipulate', 'press', 'advantage', 'not', 'Klan', 'movie', ""'m"", 'sure', 'Diana', 'was', 'perfect', 'saint', 'completely', 'selfish', 'woman', 'who', 'quoted', 'movie', 'saying', '34', 'am', 'princess', 'who', 'what', '34', 'Hasnat', 'Klan', 'actor', 'who', 'portrayed', 'movie', '34', 'gorgeous', 'creature', '34', 'Diana', 'could', ""n't"", 'resist', 'truly', 'doubt', 'Klan', 'was', 'love-sick', 'doctor', 'who', 'fought', 'crowds', 'order', 'leave', 'flowers', 'side', 'thousands', 'left', 'public', 'poem', 'promising', 'find', 'Diana', 'live', 'Diana', 'movie', 'embarrassment', 'actors', 'writers', 'producers', 'idea', 'was', 'portray', 'Diana', 'selfish', 'woman', 'who', 'stalked', 'man', 'ended', 'relationship', 'then', 'was', 'success', 'Regardless', 'faults', 'Diana', 'surviving', 'children', 'deserve', 'better', 'pitiful', 'obviously', 'inaccurate', 'movie']",Diana
1678811,A1IOZW3V00KGUG,B00GM7STPI,ArtHouse,"[2, 3]","This is actually quite a good movie. It was not marketed properly. It is really not a bio pic. It does not show anything much of royal family interactions, even with her boys and Charles, which would be necessary in that type movie. If someone expects that, or expects the movie to show that over-the-top glitz and glamour of royal European life, they will be disappointed.It should have been titled &#34;The Garden&#34; and marketed as more of a quiet, tragic love story. Actually most of the details are true, except for those they obviously had to invent. Acting, writing, and directing are quite good. The purpose here seems to be to show how life must have been for Diana in her last two years: what looks exciting in the gossip pages plays out in real life as quiet, lonely and isolating. I think the movie is successful at capturing and conveying this feeling. It is also successful in showing the characters as real people with contradictions in feeling and behavior. This movie is similar in tone to &#34;The Iron Lady&#34; which was also not very successful. However, in that movie, Margaret Thatcher shown as a real, fallible person, is just not that interesting or likable. Here, Diana is very likable, even with her flaws.I really liked it, taking it for what it is. And it is masterful at portraying the feeling I believe all of us had at her death, of profound loss and a sense of incompleteness and waste of life and magic. If this film has a flaw, it is that Naomi Watts, who does a really good job here, still can't capture the unique magic that was Diana. She just doesn't come across with the captivating sense that Diana had. However, I don't know that anyone could do that.

1678815,A1PJZKEZQGREDY,B00GM7STPI,California Dreaming,"[2, 3]","I visited London about 15 years ago, and I was riding the subway somewhere downtown and underground.  A sign inside read something like ""Leicester Square,"" and some smart-alec girl -- err, nice young English woman -- pointed up at the word ""Leicester"" and asked me how I'd pronounce it.  Cute.  Me runners must've given me away, so that's how she 'twas clevah 'nough to know that I was an American.  And therefore couldn't pronounce ""Leicester.""  Ah, she and her fellow lovelies had a few cute little laughs while I struggled trying to pronounce some stupid word.And I've noticed that people from England who visit America love to rip all over our political system -- hey, you won't hurt my feelings, as I don't think much of it myself -- but they get all cranky if you don't say how great the Royal Family is, or how much better their system is than ours.  Yes, they can dish it out, but they surely cannot take it.I just think that they should dump the Royals myself; it would save them a lot of money.  Plus, what good do they really do, anyways?  Jousting isn't that important anymore -- it hasn't been since the middle ages -- but there is something even better nowadays:  nuclear weapons.  If you don't have those I suppose that land mines just might do the trick.  Sure, the English might take in a few pounds more from foolish Americans who want to cross the Atlantic just to see royalty, and maybe take in the Tower of London.  (I actually recommend that site myself if you go; that was pretty entertaining.)  But the royal coffers are getting so low that even the Queen was recently chastised for being poor with, well, The Queen's Money.If you're getting the impression that I couldn't care less about the Royals, or even England itself, you're pretty quick.  And in reality, when everyone was going crazy about the real-life Princess Diana back in the '90s, I just mostly shrugged and found her to be a little bit of a bore.  ""Land mines are quite dangerous.""  Really?  You think?  I guess that she was the Princess of Understatement as well.But the interesting thing is, while everyone else seems to hate this film -- I believe that only 8 percent of critics liked it according to Flixster with ""Rotten Tomatoes"" -- I actually really liked this film.  I thought that the cinematography was really good to start.And even though I always complain when movies try to play with the viewers' emotions -- and this one is surely not exempt from that -- this one does it in more subtle and reasonable ways.  I thought that Naomi Watts -- and I will admit that I am a pretty big fan -- was spot on here, and she comes across as a very sympathetic character, even though she plays a Brit.  (I believe that Diana originally was from Wales; isn't that a ""Brit"" as well?"")  And Naveen Andrews made an excellent love interest here, and I usually complain about love interests in film, too.  Why do Americans always mistakenly believe that there must be a love interest in film?  Well, in this one, a love interest is required.That love interest is required because we need to see that, while Princess Diana was supposedly ""loved by five billion people around the world"" (her words), she was perhaps really loved by none.  But I think that you will love Ms. Watts in this film, and really, would you expect anything less from her?

This a very speculative film one where it hypothesizes what would become of Diana if she were allowed to be the person she wanted to be, to follow her heart, and love and be loved in return.  This isn't to suggest that she wasn't loved by her adoring public but she wasn't loved in that intimate way that we should all experience certainly not by Prince Charles.  The focus of ""Diana"" is a romantic entanglement between herself and a  Pakistani heart surgeon that is everything her marriage to Charles wasn't.  This relationship is a tender one shared by two intelligent people madly in love with each other.  I'm not sure this coupling existed or was elevated by the filmmakers to send a message.  The sense I get is the makers of the film are engaging in wish fulfillment, their own and posthumously for Diana. I also like how they deglamorize Diana taking off her makeup and allowing her humanizing blemishes to be shown both literally and figuratively. They point the finger at our celebrity obsessed culture with neither the paparazzi nor the public that lap up their offerings spared from blame.  I've read a lot of the negative reviews from other viewers and their criticism stems from it not being the film they wanted it to be.  I sense they wanted something glitzier and more melodramatic.  I give the makers props for constructing a film that dares to go against the assumptions of its intended audience.  Naomi Watts is outstanding as Diana as is Naveen Andrews as the surgeon.

There's also much about Diana's attempts to control what the press is saying, how Dr. Hasnat's work and personal life are affected, their constant efforts to dodge the paparazzi, etc. While it does go into some of the Princess's humanitarian projects in other parts of the world, there is virtually nothing on Diana's earlier years, the rest of the Royal Family, and/or a number of other things that would interest most viewers.While it didn't thrill me, DIANA certainly kept my attention as a human interest/romance film. Naomi Watts, an actress it's hard to imagine giving a less-than-stellar performance, captures Lady Di quite well personality-wise and about as well as she could appearance-wise. The resemblance is far from perfect but close enough to where it didn't bother me. {Note: A number of people obviously disagree w/me on these last points.} Finally, though they seem a bit tacked-on in some places, the bits of poetry--such as the one used as the title of this review--still add a little something.Though the plot is languid, DIANA succeeds in showing the difficulties of semi-forbidden relationships such as this, as well as in showing the all-too-plain humanity of Diana and, by proxy, anyone else who is given celebrity status.

In truth it is not as bad as it was made out to be, even though some of the details seem implausible (would Diana (Naomi Watts) be able to leave Kensington Palace on her nocturnal visits to Hasnat (Naveen Andrews) so easily, without being discovered or hounded by reporters?)  Nonetheless Oliver Hirschbiegel's film does a competent job of portraying the sheer loneliness of Diana's existence in Kensington Palace, surrounded by servants but with no one to love her.  Although tremendously popular with people and the media alike, she cannot get close to anyone; and when she does, her love-affair is doomed.  Watts does not resemble Diana facially, but she does a good job of conveying both the good and not-so-good sides of her character; her desire to help people, her feeling of alienation from all families, and her tendency to manipulate the media to suit her purposes.  The film suggests, perhaps controversially, that Diana brought much of the press harassment on herself, especially when she asks a trusted photographer to take snaps of herself and Dodi Fayed (Cas Anvar), with the sole purpose of making Hasnat jealous, and thereby encouraging him to call her again after a long interval.  She certainly knows how to portray herself on screen - as seen, for instance, in her celebrated interview with the BBC's Martin Bashir (Prasanna Puwanrajah), where she deliberately adopts a pose for the camera so as to obtain maximum sympathy from viewers.  Nonetheless the film does suggest that she was more sinned against than sinning - a victim, perhaps, of the contemporary obsession with fame and celebrity.",3,Not as Bad as the Critics Would Have Us Believe,1397088000,"04 10, 2014",2014,1734,"['DIANA', 'was', 'almost', 'universally', 'panned', 'release', 'September', 'attract', 'negative', 'comments', 'users', 'truth', 'not', 'as', 'bad', 'was', 'made', 'out', 'be', 'even', 'details', 'seem', 'implausible', 'would', 'Diana', 'Naomi', 'Watts', 'be', 'able', 'leave', 'Kensington', 'Palace', 'nocturnal', 'visits', 'Hasnat', 'Naveen', 'Andrews', 'so', 'easily', 'being', 'discovered', 'hounded', 'reporters', 'Nonetheless', 'Oliver', 'Hirschbiegel', 'film', 'competent', 'job', 'portraying', 'sheer', 'loneliness', 'Diana', 'existence', 'Kensington', 'Palace', 'surrounded', 'servants', 'one', 'love', 'tremendously', 'popular', 'people', 'media', 'alike', 'can', 'not', 'get', 'close', 'anyone', 'when', 'love-affair', 'doomed', 'Watts', 'not', 'resemble', 'Diana', 'facially', 'good', 'job', 'conveying', 'good', 'not-so-good', 'sides', 'character', 'desire', 'help', 'people', 'feeling', 'alienation', 'families', 'tendency', 'manipulate', 'media', 'suit', 'purposes', 'film', 'perhaps', 'controversially', 'Diana', 'brought', 'much', 'press', 'harassment', 'especially', 'when', 'trusted', 'photographer', 'take', 'snaps', 'herself', 'Dodi', 'Fayed', 'Cas', 'Anvar', 'sole', 'purpose', 'making', 'Hasnat', 'jealous', 'thereby', 'encouraging', 'call', 'again', 'long', 'interval', 'certainly', 'how', 'portray', 'screen', 'seen', 'instance', 'celebrated', 'interview', 'BBC', 'Martin', 'Bashir', 'Prasanna', 'Puwanrajah', 'where', 'deliberately', 'pose', 'camera', 'so', 'obtain', 'maximum', 'sympathy', 'viewers', 'film', 'suggest', 'was', 'more', 'sinned', 'sinning', 'victim', 'perhaps', 'contemporary', 'obsession', 'fame', 'celebrity']",Diana

And there are biographical movies that rape the fabric of space-time with their wretchedness.Guess what kind ""Diana"" is.In fact, this seething drippy movie is not even a biographical piece -- it's more of a filmed fanfiction, allegedly about the late princess' affair with heart surgeon Hasnat Khan (who hated this movie). Everything about ""Diana"" goes completely wrong, from Naomi Watts' breathy brainless performance to the driveling soap-opera script that seems more appropriate for the Lifetime Channel.At the time of the film's beginning, Princess Diana (Watts) is pretty much at the end of her marriage to Prince Charles (Sir Not-Appearing-in-This-Film) but is still loved and followed by everybody. Then she meets Khan (Naveen Andrews), whose devotion to saving lives immediately interests her -- and ""I'm a princess; I always get what I want.""The two begin an affair, and Diana is dazzled by the normalcy of his life -- jazz, burgers, watching sports on TV, etc. And since Diana was a dazed ingenue with NO idea how to handle the press or her image, only Khan can coach her in how to use her celebrity for good. But the constant attention and paparazzi start to wear on their relationship, driving them apart -- and eventually, leading to tragedy.Director Oliver Hirschbiegel is possibly the biggest Diana fanboy since EVER, and he presents the last years of her life like a bad romance novel. He bludgeons us with all sorts of sentimental glorifying garbage intermingled with a bad romantic plot. This is a Princess Di movie meant to appeal to people who already think she was a saint, and thus won't step on their toes.After all, Diana was just SO down to earth that she took her shoes off in her house! And she never used the press for her own ends! No no, she was a wide-eyed ingenue who had NO idea that explosive interviews could cause trouble for the royals (""I don't do strategy""), or that she could use the press for her own ends! No, she was just so GENUINE and REAL and HONEST, and wanted a NORMAL life! Gag me.It actually gets kind of nauseating to see him vomit the most transparent hype on the viewers. It doesn't help that he tries his best to emotionally manipulate the audience all the time, with revoltingly sappy scenes like Diana and Khan frolicking through a field or reciting poetry in bed.And that's just the sappiness and emotional manipulation -- this movie is ghastly on every level of quality. Hirschbiegel wholeheartedly embraces every cliche that cinema has to offer -- when rejected by Khan, Diana responds by running tearfully through the night. And the dialogue is bad enough to burn holes in your eardrums -- for example, ""You don't perform the surgery. The surgery performs you"" (which caused me to blurt out, ""In Mother Russia, surgery performs YOU!"").Naomi Watts was pretty much miscast from the beginning, and this is possibly her worst role to date -- her Diana is all breathy, doe-eyed innocent. And while Hirschbiegel demands that we admire her, he also attributes everything good that she ever did to Hasnat Khan. Ah, feminism.But despite the fawning, she actually comes across as rather creepy, breaking into her lover's apartment to clean it, visiting his family and chasing him like a sex-changed Edward Cullen. Despite Hirschbiegel's depiction of her as a suffering saint, she comes across as a bratty, whiny teenager who wants a guy, refuses to care about his misgivings and goes psycho when rejected.I'll credit Naveen Andrews -- he gives a semi-decent performance, considering the garbage he has to spew. Sadly, the movie is uninterested in the relationships that truly did shape Diana -- her children, her family, her ex-husband Charles, the repressive web of royals -- and they are reduced to nothing but fleeting shadows, without substance or voice.Someday, someone will make a great biopic of Princess Diana... and hopefully, it will overshadow the cliched, fawning drivel in ""Diana.""

I'm ashamed I watched this movie, because it reminds me of why we lost one of the world's most courageous, caring and compassionate women.  The truth is that Diana WAS murdered - and by ALL OF US.  We bought the magazines with the photos the paparrazzi so grossly invaded her life to get, we hungered for the smallest details of our icon.  Perhaps she would still be alive today if the world, in its greed, hadn't provided a market for the last breaths she drew.&#34;Diana&#34; does pay fitting tribute to the greatest gifts Diana gave the world, with its depiction of her hospital visits and her campaign to ban land mines.  Naomi Watts faithfully portrays the late princess' compassion, with the horrified gaze, her disgust that her attempts to use her fame to bring attention to worthy causes was so often ignored in favor of glamor shots, the gentle brush of her fingertip over the tortured cheek of a child brutalized by a mine's blast.Still, there's too much guesswork here, and an intrusion into the life and grief of her surviving friends, particularly Dr. Hasnat Khan. Their romance ended due to his aversion for the public life that Diana could never escape, and now the most private, intimate moments of his life have been thrown out for public curiosity and entertainment. Better that this movie had never been made - or, only with his approval.There are girls, there are women, and there are ladies.  Diana was, in every sense, a Lady.  One can only pray that she is truly in a place where she can never be hurt or intruded up on again - since her privacy knows no respect, still, here on this Earth.",3,3 Stars.....for Naomi Watts,1393804800,"03 3, 2014",2014,2532,"['Naomi', 'Watts', 'well', 'aware', 'one', 'can', 'ever', 'accurately', 'depict', 'late', 'Princess', 'Wales', 'obvious', 'utmost', 'best', 'must', 'have', 'spend', 'thousands', 'hours', 'watching', 'real', 'Diana', 'moves', 'right', '.the', 'blush', 'shy', 'dip', 'head', 'sidelong', 'stare', 'breathy', 'voice', 'even', 'wounded', 'eyes', 'dazzling', 'smile', 'so', 'well', 'known', 'world', 'When', 'dressed', 'replicas', 'famous', 'jewels', 'reproduction', 'Versace', 'Catherine', 'Walker', 'almost', 'not', 'quite', 'can', 'believe', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'whisper', 'ghost', 'beauty', 'so', 'tragically', 'lost', 'world.The', 'rest', 'script', 'too', 'much', 'tabloid', 'probably', 'what', 'Diana', 'heart', 'surgeon', 'Hasnat', 'Khan', 'said', 'other', 'might', 'not', 'be', 'what', 'said', 'too', 'much', 'guesswork', 'up', 'being', 'tawdry', 'reenactment', 'what', 'was', 'likely', 'most', 'private', 'painful', 'last', 'years', ""'m"", 'ashamed', 'watched', 'movie', 'why', 'lost', 'one', 'world', 'most', 'courageous', 'caring', 'compassionate', 'women', 'truth', 'Diana', 'WAS', 'murdered', 'ALL', 'OF', 'US', 'bought', 'magazines', 'photos', 'paparrazzi', 'so', 'grossly', 'invaded', 'life', 'get', 'hungered', 'smallest', 'details', 'icon', 'Perhaps', 'would', 'still', 'be', 'alive', 'today', 'world', 'greed', 'had', ""n't"", 'provided', 'market', 'last', 'breaths', '34', 'Diana', '34', 'pay', 'fitting', 'tribute', 'greatest', 'gifts', 'Diana', 'gave', 'world', 'depiction', 'hospital', 'visits', 'campaign', 'ban', 'land', 'mines', 'Naomi', 'Watts', 'faithfully', 'late', 'princess', 'compassion', 'horrified', 'gaze', 'disgust', 'attempts', 'use', 'fame', 'bring', 'attention', 'worthy', 'causes', 'was', 'so', 'often', 'ignored', 'favor', 'glamor', 'shots', 'gentle', 'brush', 'fingertip', 'tortured', 'cheek', 'child', 'brutalized', 'mine', 'blast.Still', 'too', 'much', 'guesswork', 'here', 'intrusion', 'life', 'grief', 'surviving', 'friends', 'particularly', 'Dr.', 'Hasnat', 'Khan', 'romance', 'ended', 'due', 'aversion', 'public', 'life', 'Diana', 'could', 'never', 'escape', 'now', 'most', 'private', 'intimate', 'moments', 'life', 'have', 'been', 'thrown', 'out', 'public', 'curiosity', 'entertainment', 'Better', 'movie', 'had', 'never', 'been', 'made', 'only', 'are', 'girls', 'are', 'women', 'are', 'ladies', 'Diana', 'was', 'sense', 'Lady', 'One', 'can', 'only', 'pray', 'truly', 'place', 'where', 'can', 'never', 'be', 'hurt', 'intruded', 'up', 'again', 'privacy', 'respect', 'still', 'here', 'Earth']",Diana

1678839,A328S9RN3U5M68,B00GM7STPI,Grady Harp,"[2, 2]","According to the Hollywood Reporter, November 3, 2013 by Pamela McClintock, PRINCESS DIANA BIOPIC BOMBS IN NORTH AMERICA: `Oliver Hirschbiegel's critically reviled biopic Diana -- starring Naomi Watts as the late Princess of Wales -- was quickly dethroned by moviegoers in North America, grossing $64,914 from 38 theaters for a bleak location average of $1,708. From a screenplay based on Kate Snell's 2001 book `Diana: Her Last Love', the ill-fated biopic recounts the final two years of Princess Diana's life, including her love affairs with heart surgeon Hasnat Khan and Dodi Fayed. Story: 'Diana' Director Oliver Hirschbiegel Says Negative Reviews Are 'Devastating.' Diana opened a month ago in the U.K., where it also bombed (one British reviewer called it ""car crash"" cinema). Entertainment One, which is distributing the film in the U.S. and a number of other key markets, including the U.K., is hoping Diana finds an afterlife on DVD, VOD and other digital platforms.'So now it is out on DVD and for those who elect to buy it (or see it on Pay per View) and the feelings remain mixed. The most brief summary of the film is this: `During the last two years of her life, Princess Diana embarks on a final rite of passage: a secret love affair with Pakistani heart surgeon Hasnat Khan.'The work of Naomi Watts is consistently fine but due to some bleeps in makeup and hair design and mannerisms pasted on this fine actress she doesn't quite come across as the Diana the world worshiped. The script is plebeian, but some fine actors make the best of it - especially Geraldine Jones as Diana's masseuse and spiritual counselor Oonagh, Juliet Stephenson as her best (seemingly her only) friend Sonia, and Charles Edwards as her `manager'. Naveen Andrews tries to make the role of Hasnat Khan credible but doesn't quite get there. Cas Anvar gets very little to say as the controversial Dodi Fayed, and set-up photographer Paul is appropriately quiet as portrayed by Douglas Hodge. Yes, we are allowed to see the tip of the iceberg of Diana's generosity in righting social wrongs around the globe, but in the end the biopic fails to add anything new to the paparazzi besmirched life of a Princess the world loved.

I was also uncomfortable with the intimate details of her relationship with the Pakistani doctor, played by Naveen Andrews.

There was even one year that I couldn't read enough books about Diana. So much so that I felt that I knew her personally. However, I had never read much about her relationship with Hasnat Khan. I kind of felt like Diana liked to keep that part of her life private but we all have to know those details, too. So I see this movie available on Amazon and I couldn't wait for it to begin. All I could think of as I watched this movie was how much Diana would have loathed this film. In my head, I must have repeated &#34;POOR DIANA&#34; over and over. I felt guilty watching and I wanted so badly to change the outcome for her.  But we all know how this fairytale ends.The film mostly covers the months of Diana's life that she spent with Hasnat Khan and the last month spent with Dodi. Obviously, it's part-fiction because no one knows what happened between Diana and Khan except for the two of them and I doubt Khan had much of a hand in the making of this film. It's an ok film but if you are a fan of the late princess then, of course, you must see it. I really like Naomi Watts' acting ability but NOT in this film. WHAT IS UP WITH THE HORRIBLE WIG? Really?

Well, I guess I can understand why some may not like this film. I think one of the main issues that people had with this film is that this was a chick flick, rather than a biography of Diana. Well first off, this film was not supposed to be a biography of Diana, it was supposed to be a vision of the hidden romantic relationship between Diana and Khan.To be honest, I am rather ignorant of Princess Diana. I didn't know much about who she was, or what she did. I am only 17, so please pardon my ignorance.I did in fact enjoy the film. It wasn't the greatest movie ever made, but I did find it interesting. I am a fan of chick flicks, so I felt the urge to click on to this title on Netflix. The romance between Diana and Khan is quite the intriguing one. Throughout the entire film their relationship is jumping up and down. Evidently, their relationship falls out of balance. Khan just did not what all of the glamour and publicity from the royal treatment. Instead he would rather do what he loves best, being a surgeon. He and Diana are struggling to sort things as their relationship remains secret. With the media constantly strangling the truth out of them, people all around are gossiping, they just can't find fitting in their relationship.Naomi Watts simply does a great job at her attempt to portray Diana. I guess the negative part that I would have to say about this film is the sloppiness. I felt as though the scenes just weren't put together properly, nor was the story. So I guess you can blame that on the writers. The film can be rather dull at some points. During some scenes you are just going to be like ""That's it?"" With that being said, parts of the film lack a solid execution, which in most cases, can be very difficult for many to overcome. However, due to the historical background this film provides, the well thought out story, and the top notch acting, you should certainly give this film a go.If you are looking for a piece of biological information, skip it. If you are looking for an inside romance story of one of the greatest females who ever lived, please give this film a chance.",3,Hollywood attempts to bring royalty to one of the most influential person to have ever existed,1399939200,"05 13, 2014",2014,2217,"['film', 'received', 'lot', 'negative', 'response', 'Americans', 'Englanders', 'Well', 'guess', 'can', 'understand', 'why', 'may', 'not', 'like', 'film', 'think', 'one', 'main', 'issues', 'people', 'had', 'film', 'was', 'chick', 'flick', 'rather', 'biography', 'Diana', 'Well', 'first', 'off', 'film', 'was', 'not', 'supposed', 'be', 'biography', 'Diana', 'was', 'supposed', 'be', 'vision', 'hidden', 'romantic', 'relationship', 'Diana', 'Khan.To', 'be', 'honest', 'am', 'rather', 'ignorant', 'Princess', 'Diana', 'did', ""n't"", 'know', 'much', 'who', 'was', 'what', 'did', 'am', 'only', '17', 'so', 'please', 'pardon', 'ignorance.I', 'did', 'fact', 'film', 'was', ""n't"", 'greatest', 'movie', 'ever', 'made', 'did', 'find', 'interesting', 'am', 'fan', 'chick', 'flicks', 'felt', 'urge', 'click', 'title', 'Netflix', 'romance', 'Diana', 'Khan', 'quite', 'intriguing', 'one', 'entire', 'film', 'relationship', 'jumping', 'up', 'down', 'Evidently', 'relationship', 'balance', 'Khan', 'just', 'did', 'not', 'what', 'glamour', 'publicity', 'royal', 'treatment', 'Instead', 'would', 'rather', 'do', 'what', 'best', 'being', 'surgeon', 'Diana', 'are', 'struggling', 'sort', 'things', 'relationship', 'secret', 'media', 'constantly', 'strangling', 'truth', 'people', 'around', 'are', 'gossiping', 'just', 'ca', ""n't"", 'find', 'fitting', 'relationship.Naomi', 'Watts', 'simply', 'great', 'job', 'attempt', 'portray', 'Diana', 'guess', 'negative', 'part', 'would', 'have', 'say', 'film', 'sloppiness', 'felt', 'scenes', 'just', 'were', ""n't"", 'put', 'together', 'properly', 'was', 'story', 'guess', 'can', 'blame', 'writers', 'film', 'can', 'be', 'rather', 'dull', 'points', 'scenes', 'are', 'just', 'going', 'be', 'being', 'said', 'parts', 'film', 'lack', 'solid', 'execution', 'most', 'cases', 'can', 'be', 'very', 'difficult', 'many', 'overcome', 'However', 'due', 'historical', 'background', 'film', 'well', 'thought', 'out', 'story', 'top', 'notch', 'acting', 'should', 'certainly', 'give', 'film', 'go.If', 'are', 'looking', 'piece', 'biological', 'information', 'skip', 'are', 'looking', 'inside', 'romance', 'story', 'one', 'greatest', 'females', 'who', 'ever', 'lived', 'please', 'give', 'film', 'chance']",Diana

1678865,A14GK0E64J0WAS,B00GM7STPI,Paul Allaer,"[83, 91]","""Diana"" (2013 release from the UK; 113 min. ) brings the last 2 years in the life of Diana, Princess of Wales. As the movie opens, we see Diana (played by Naomi Watts) getting ready in the Ritz Hotel in Paris, on that infamous day of August 31, 1997. Then the movie jumps back 2 years earlier. Diana and Charles are living separate lives. We see Diana in sweatpants and unhappy (and alone) at her London residence). By chance Diana meets Hasnat Khan, a Pakistani heart surgeon (played by Naveen Andrews). It isn't before long that Diana and Khan are falling for each other, and must go to extraordinary measures to keep this a secret from the press and from the world. Khan tells Diana about his passion for football (a/k/a soccer) and jazz, and at one point Diana even dons a black wig and the two go to a jazz club in London, where Diana has the time of her life. To tell you more of the 'plot' would be pointless.Several comments: this movie has been universally panned by the critics, and it obviously has not done well at the box office either (more on that later), so I must admit I had some doubts about seeing this, but given that Naomi Watts was playing Diana, I took a chance on this. As it turns out, I quite enjoyed this movie! I have no idea whether the events between Diana and Kahn as depicted in this movie are accurate or whether some of them even happened at all (did the two of them really snuck out of London in Diana's butler's car and took a trip to the cliffs of Dover?). But in the end, the details are not what matter, in the sense that this movie gives a great glimpse into the utter loneliness that surrounds Diana when she is not out in the public (the movie restages a number of iconic moments from those last 2 years, including the infamous ""Queen of Hearts"" interview with the BBC in November ;95, the trip to Angola to meet landmine victims, etc.). Besides the loneliness, Diana also comes across as insecure and sometimes childish (at one point when arguing with Khan, she yells out ""I'm a princess and I get what I want!""), so this movie is not just a one-directional flattering image of Diana. And then there is the non-stop haunting by the press, in particular the paparazzi photographers. It is so relentless, one cannot even begin to imagine what it really must have been like to live in the limelight like that. The last 30 min. of the movie (about Diana and Dodi Fayed) are painful to watch, as by then her life has become a complete circus, in fact more like a Greek tragedy, the ending of which we all know. This movie was capably directed by German director Oliver Hirschbiegel (best known for that Hitler movie ""The Downfall"" some years ago). But the true star of the movie is of course Naomi Watts, who took a big professional gamble when she agreed to take on the role of such an iconic figure. She pulls it off brilliantly in my opinion, and this is another Oscar nomination-worthy performance.""Diana"" opened on 2 screens for all of Greater Cincinnati this past weekend, and given the negative buzz around this movie, I figured this would not be playing long so I went to see it today. The screening I saw this at was unfortunately not well attended. It's a shame, as this movie for me turned out to be a pleasant surprise, even if the subject matter is not a happy one (you won't walk out of this thinking ""that was a jolly good time!"").

When she meets Dr. Hasnat Khan (Andrews) she begins to think she found her answer. Little by little the two begin to fall in love but her celebrity winds up making the choice for them. I am a huge fan of bio-pics and was looking forward to this one mainly because this happened at a time that I remember. I wasn't a big follower of the royal family but when she did I remember she died with a man named Dodi Fayed so the whole love story aspect of the movie (though the main focus) seemed inconsequential. I know this was a love story movie going in but when they added in scenes where she is talking about land mines or mentions that she visits children in hospitals they felt like an after thought. Much like Iron Lady this movie shows a specific personal love story rather then the greatness of the individual. To that end the movie doesn't do Diana justice, as a love story it is OK. Naomi Watts however was great in this. Overall, doesn't focus enough on the things that made Diana great and the reason she was so loved enough for me to really get into it.

As most of us know what happened on the fatal day of 31 August 1997, the film naturally focuses something else, in this case her romantic relationship with heart surgeon Hasnat Khan (Naveen Andrews).The result is a superficial romance without much chemistry. Personally I have no problem with the silly dialogue and sentimental moments. Naomi Watts does her best and her performance as the late Princess is impressive, but the character she plays lacks depth and resonance.What would it be going out with someone travelling around the world for international charities, someone who is chased by paparazzi? &#8220;Diana&#8221; misses chances to explore the intriguing aspect of their relationship. The film certainly portrays her as an independent and impulsive person, but it seems the director is not really interested in her personality as a humanitarian or a woman in love.So what you get here is a film that goes on and on without making any points.
