It has my man Usher in it incl. the whole cast Rosario Dawson, Vanessa Williams, Forest Whitaker, Sara Gilbert, Fredro Starr (he's bad), the whole list goes on and on.I was laughin' to death when a lot of craziness goin' on inside the movies from the guns poppin, the police chasin', a lotta people gettin' out of the school 'cuz of emergency, lot of mad talkin and fussin' goin on and all that other s**t. Y'know what I mean. Anyway the list goes on and on.This is similar to those that don't like gangsta rap nor hip-hop/rap, mainstream music, soundtracks, gangsta movies, or whatever it is, it doesn't matter.

481265,A2WZON0QPX7C9X,6305868913,"Nancy E. ""Nancy""","[0, 1]","Inner city schools usually aren't the nicest places in the world. But the condition here is terrible. The windows are broken, only half the students  have books, and the teachers literary don't give a damn about the kids. The  conditions are so terrible that when the only decent teacher gets fired and  a student is attacked by a school cop it pushes six students over the edge.  They take an ingured cop hostage and demand things that should be standared  in schools, like books and windows. The problem is the people in the city  aren't to keen on giving them what they want.In my opinion this movie  was great and it really opened up peoples eyes to poor conditions in  schools and other serious issues like child abuse drugs and teen pregnency.  I loved it myself. My only complaint is with the cussing.

Schoenfeld,"[1, 2]","Similar to the recent movie Negotiator, Light it Up follows a group of teens who take a police officer hostage with the demands to bring back a teacher that was unfairly fired and improve their education.  This movie  does have good points to it, and it makes you think because it is from the  point of view of the teens, and it also sends a message about how the media  makes most teens look like hoodlums, when all they really want is equal  rights.  The only thing this movie suffers from is cliches.  All the  characters in this movie are too un-original, and the writers purposely  made sure that all the characters were too diverse, just to increase the  drama between them.Overall, it is a well made dramatic movie, but the  DVD suffers from lack of features.  it is still reccomended.",4,We Demand Education!,960940800,"06 14, 2000",2000,792,"['Similar', 'recent', 'movie', 'Negotiator', 'Light', 'Up', 'group', 'teens', 'who', 'take', 'police', 'officer', 'hostage', 'demands', 'bring', 'back', 'teacher', 'was', 'unfairly', 'fired', 'improve', 'education', 'movie', 'have', 'good', 'points', 'think', 'point', 'view', 'teens', 'also', 'message', 'how', 'media', 'most', 'teens', 'look', 'hoodlums', 'when', 'really', 'want', 'equal', 'rights', 'only', 'thing', 'movie', 'suffers', 'cliches', 'characters', 'movie', 'are', 'too', 'un-original', 'writers', 'purposely', 'made', 'sure', 'characters', 'were', 'too', 'diverse', 'just', 'increase', 'drama', 'them.Overall', 'well', 'made', 'dramatic', 'movie', 'DVD', 'suffers', 'lack', 'features', 'still', 'reccomended']",Light It Up VHS
