Please, someone send this set to Christin O'Donnell.I loved Dennis and was a major fan and follower in the 90s. He was one of my top 3 heroes that I wanted to meet or be like. He was the smartest of the smart asses. And every season on HBO I was right there with him. I even have a collection of episodes from the run of the show, having few early ones, but all of the seasons in 97, 98, 99 and 00 and a few of the later seasons.It was painful to watch Dennis shift to right of center, then further right after his HBO show ended. I can't blame an entertainer for making the call to go to the side where he thinks his bread will be better buttered.But if you watch his HBO show, and now if you watch all of these specials back to back, you will see that by the end, something just doesn't ring true. People don't really change that much. But as a comedian, we all should have known that a lot of it was an act.Lewis Black has replced Dennis as my favorite comic working (but then again, Dennis isn't really working that much anymore, now is he?). Black fills the void that Dennis left behind.I miss my old hero Dennis, but at least I have the dvds of his HBO show, and soon I will have these all too.",4,watch evolution in reverse,1287273600,"10 17, 2010",2010,1300,"['twenty', 'year', 'almost', 'span', 'can', 'now', 'watch', 'Dennis', 'Miller', 'de-evolve', 'right', 'very', 'eyes', 'Please', 'someone', 'send', 'set', 'Christin', ""O'Donnell.I"", 'loved', 'Dennis', 'was', 'major', 'fan', 'follower', '90s', 'was', 'one', 'top', '3', 'heroes', 'wanted', 'meet', 'be', 'was', 'smartest', 'smart', 'asses', 'season', 'HBO', 'was', 'right', 'there', 'even', 'have', 'collection', 'episodes', 'run', 'show', 'having', 'few', 'early', 'ones', 'seasons', '97', '98', '99', '00', 'few', 'later', 'seasons.It', 'was', 'painful', 'watch', 'Dennis', 'shift', 'right', 'center', 'then', 'further', 'right', 'HBO', 'show', 'ended', 'ca', ""n't"", 'blame', 'entertainer', 'making', 'call', 'go', 'side', 'where', 'bread', 'will', 'be', 'better', 'buttered.But', 'watch', 'HBO', 'show', 'now', 'watch', 'specials', 'back', 'back', 'will', 'see', 'end', 'something', 'just', ""n't"", 'ring', 'true', 'People', 'do', ""n't"", 'really', 'change', 'much', 'comedian', 'should', 'have', 'known', 'lot', 'was', 'act.Lewis', 'Black', 'replced', 'Dennis', 'favorite', 'comic', 'working', 'then', 'again', 'Dennis', ""n't"", 'really', 'working', 'much', 'anymore', 'now', 'Black', 'void', 'Dennis', 'left', 'behind.I', 'miss', 'old', 'hero', 'Dennis', 'least', 'have', 'dvds', 'HBO', 'show', 'soon', 'will', 'have', 'too']",Dennis Miller: The HBO Comedy Specials

Nice decision on my part! I thoroughly enjoy Dennis' humor. Being a relatively &#34;old guy&#34;, most of Dennis' cultural references are not lost on me, even in the earliest recordings.

1229789,A3RICVFW2YD1LZ,B001PSVHN0,"T. Scarillo ""music snob""","[13, 13]","This is a very good value for the money - Dennis Miller's seven (7) HBO Specials on three DVD's.  Some of these have never been on DVD before, and it's pretty convenient to have them all in one package.I'm giving it five stars, mainly for value and for the inclusion of the two key specials: Mr. Miller Goes to Washington (1988), which is the very same show that (more or less, with a couple of edits) was released as the classic ""Off-White Album"" on Warner Bros. Records - this LP was a staple of my college years.  The other absolute gem here is ""The Millennium Special"", which I think was up for an Emmy or two.  It's one of the greatest comedy specials you'll ever see - consistently firing on all cylinders, hitting both highbrow historical references and some pretty lowbrow laughs (with Norm McDonald, who is a riot with his `guest' appearances throughout).  I taped this off HBO and must've watched it around 12 or 15 times over the years, and always wondered why it wasn't out on DVD.  The other specials included are ""Black and White"" (1990), ""Live From Washington DC"" (1994), ""Citizen Arcane"" (1996), ""The Raw Feed"" (2003) and ""All In"" (2006).  All specials are basically 45 min-to-one-hour in running length, ranging from very good to just ok - the two recent ones are just ok; some good gags but I'm of the opinion that Miller was a lot funnier before he decided he was a Republican, post-9/11.  He used to be a pretty acerbic equal-opportunity offender, leaning somewhat left, but in ""Raw Feed"" and ""All In"" he pretty much comes off as a hard-core Bush Republican: for better or worse, depending on your political leanings, it's preserved here for posterity.The picture and sound on all these are excellent - very sharp, better than other video'd standup concerts I've seen from the same era.  So despite any misgivings that some might have about his metamorphosis to the right, as of late, it's still a very worthwhile collection to have if you like(d) him and/or collect standup on DVD.  If you get this, you can skip buying the few specials that were already on DVD, and you'll have everything in one package.  Ok, Baboo?  That's just my opinion, I could be wrong.......",5,"Hey Chi-Chi - it's all the HBO Specials, babe.....",1240790400,"04 27, 2009",2009,2187,"['very', 'good', 'value', 'money', 'Dennis', 'Miller', 'seven', '7', 'HBO', 'Specials', 'three', 'DVD', 'have', 'never', 'been', 'DVD', 'pretty', 'convenient', 'have', 'one', 'package.I', ""'m"", 'giving', 'five', 'stars', 'mainly', 'value', 'inclusion', 'two', 'key', 'specials', 'Mr.', 'Miller', 'Goes', 'Washington', '1988', 'very', 'same', 'show', 'more', 'less', 'couple', 'edits', 'was', 'released', 'classic', 'Off-White', 'Album', 'Warner', 'Bros.', 'Records', 'LP', 'was', 'staple', 'college', 'years', 'other', 'absolute', 'gem', 'here', 'Millennium', 'Special', 'think', 'was', 'up', 'Emmy', 'two', 'one', 'greatest', 'comedy', 'specials', ""'ll"", 'ever', 'see', 'consistently', 'firing', 'cylinders', 'hitting', 'highbrow', 'historical', 'references', 'pretty', 'lowbrow', 'laughs', 'Norm', 'McDonald', 'who', 'riot', 'guest', 'appearances', 'taped', 'off', 'HBO', 'must', ""'ve"", 'watched', '12', '15', 'times', 'years', 'always', 'wondered', 'why', 'was', ""n't"", 'out', 'DVD', 'other', 'specials', 'included', 'are', 'Black', 'White', '1990', 'Live', 'Washington', 'DC', '1994', 'Citizen', 'Arcane', '1996', 'Raw', 'Feed', '2003', '2006', 'specials', 'are', 'basically', '45', 'min-to-one-hour', 'running', 'length', 'ranging', 'very', 'good', 'just', 'ok', 'two', 'recent', 'ones', 'are', 'just', 'ok', 'good', 'gags', ""'m"", 'opinion', 'Miller', 'was', 'lot', 'funnier', 'decided', 'was', 'Republican', 'post-9/11', 'used', 'be', 'pretty', 'acerbic', 'equal-opportunity', 'offender', 'leaning', 'somewhat', 'left', 'Raw', 'Feed', 'pretty', 'much', 'off', 'hard-core', 'Bush', 'Republican', 'better', 'worse', 'depending', 'political', 'leanings', 'preserved', 'here', 'posterity.The', 'picture', 'sound', 'are', 'excellent', 'very', 'sharp', 'better', 'other', 'video', ""'d"", 'standup', 'concerts', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'same', 'era', 'So', 'misgivings', 'might', 'have', 'metamorphosis', 'right', 'late', 'still', 'very', 'worthwhile', 'collection', 'have', 'like', 'd', 'and/or', 'collect', 'standup', 'DVD', 'get', 'can', 'skip', 'buying', 'few', 'specials', 'were', 'already', 'DVD', ""'ll"", 'have', 'everything', 'one', 'package', 'Ok', 'Baboo', 'just', 'opinion', 'could', 'be', 'wrong']",Dennis Miller: The HBO Comedy Specials
