As for the story, it's a another cute Saturday afternoon popcorn film that Disney's Touchstone Pictures churned out in the early 90's.. Many familiar faces pack the cast (some before they were famous. Betty Lou (Miller) is lying for attention, especially from her cute cop husband (Thal).. the jist of the story: She finds a gun one day while in the park with her dog. She tries to turn it in and no one listens.. so when the gun turns out to be a murder weapon and she's a suspect now because she used the gun in a store bathroom while venting, and now to be lively, she refuses to say she didn't murder the guy. Really?? The story is silly & unbelievable.. and sort of insulting..  and in real life, she wouldn't be going free, she'd be charged and going to jail for lying to police, tampering with a criminal case, perjury etc.. (that's the world we live in, like it or not).. So while it's supposed to be cute, I guess if you're over 12, it's frustrating..

To gain attention she proclaims herself the murderess. Betty Lou, of red hair, is a sympathetic character and it's fun to see her snub all the interrogating male cops (including her husband) who take her for granted. She also befriends a local prostitute while in jail and otherwise asserts herself as she hasn't before.It's not all fun, however, for there are some southern Mafia characters about led by a particularly evil man named Bodine (how original).  There are a few scenes of gratuitous violence that were a big turn off.The climax is somewhat improbable but something you might expect in a TV movie.Also, there's a scene in a country bar where the singers (names unknown) recreate faithfully the great Gram Parsons/Emmylou Harris duet of ""Love Hurts.""",3,Betty Lou's coming out tonight,1055808000,"06 17, 2003",2003,1239,"['good', 'points', 'film', 'generally', 'quality', 'made-for-TV', 'film', 'not', 'something', ""'d"", 'recommend', 'buying', 'renting.Betty', 'Lou', 'librarian', 'who', 'not', 'getting', 'attention', 'arguably', 'deserves', 'police', 'officer', 'husband', 'more', 'interested', 'work', 'murder', 'town', 'involving', 'travelling', 'man', 'who', 'having', 'affair', 'local', 'married', 'woman.Betty', 'Lou', 'dog', 'discover', 'murder', 'weapon', 'gain', 'attention', 'murderess', 'Betty', 'Lou', 'red', 'hair', 'sympathetic', 'character', 'fun', 'see', 'snub', 'interrogating', 'male', 'cops', 'including', 'husband', 'who', 'take', 'granted', 'also', 'local', 'prostitute', 'jail', 'otherwise', ""n't"", 'before.It', 'not', 'fun', 'however', 'are', 'southern', 'Mafia', 'characters', 'led', 'particularly', 'evil', 'man', 'named', 'Bodine', 'how', 'original', 'are', 'few', 'scenes', 'gratuitous', 'violence', 'were', 'big', 'turn', 'off.The', 'climax', 'somewhat', 'improbable', 'something', 'might', 'expect', 'TV', 'movie.Also', 'scene', 'country', 'bar', 'where', 'singers', 'names', 'unknown', 'recreate', 'faithfully', 'great', 'Gram', 'Parsons/Emmylou', 'Harris', 'duet', 'Love', 'Hurts']",N/A

She dutifully takes it to the police, but she's ignored until she fires it and confesses to the crime.
