1092462,A3PIPHWD45VOGI,B000TXPXC8,Ace-of-Stars,"[0, 0]","Too many people I feel are truly being very unfair and biased toward this movie, perhaps for the same reason I'd originally come away from it feeling hugely let down the very first time I was able to track it down and view it for myself -- ""NOSTALGIA.""Unlike the Tom Savini version of 1990, featuring the awesome Tony Todd, this ""3D"" gimmick version already had two strikes against it going in: (1) it was not affiliated with George Romero in any way, and (2) it was not genuinely a ""remake"" of the original film, but stood as its own animal... sort of.What this version did was take basic story elements of the original movie and ""reworked"" them in a way that was both fresh and familiar at the same time (even managing to incorporate allusions to O'Bannon's 1985 ""THE RETURN OF THE LIVING DEAD""), then took it an extra step further and delved into ""SCREAM"" territory by critiquing and practically satirizing not only the original movie but the entire ""walking dead"" genre as well... and this is where I think the greatest problem lies with the movie for those who might have been expecting something a bit more straight edged in presentation and more ""faithful"" to the source material.Out of curiousity (based on a review vlogger's recommendation), I recently decided to sit through the ""prequel"" of this movie, ""NIGHT OF THE LIVING DEAD: RE-ANIMATION"" (also shot in 3D, and *NOT* to be confused with the fan-produced ""NIGHT OF THE LIVING DEAD: REANIMATED""), and I thought it was an utterly TERRIBLE movie. Even though I'd managed to forget most of the details, I did remember that the version featuring Sid Haig was nowhere near that awful! So as a result of that ""prequel"" abomination, I'd made the conscious decision to sit through ""NotLD-3D"" again, and it was during this 2nd viewing that I finally understood what the filmmakers were trying to do not just with the 3D gimmick (which I'm sure was the main selling point, but one which this movie truly did not need) but also with what they were doing with the story and its elements, both old and new. And as a result of this re-watch, I came away with a greater understanding of, and a whole new appreciation for, this film.""NotLD-3D"" does have one aspect about itself which I do count as a major and serious flaw which I feel definitely detracts away from the engrossing experience however, and that is the blatant and unapologetic references to the original Romero classic, as though the characters in the movie were all living in a universe where they were fully aware of the NotLD franchise but were still made to play out those very iconic roles, which disrupts the flow and suspension of disbelief the movie is trying to encase us in -- much like how Marlon Wayons' ""Shorty"" character in ""SCARY MOVIE"" insisted on smacking us directly in the face with the knowledge that everything we'd been watching play out on the screen was identical to the movie it was itself parodying.I also had a problem with the characters using the ""Z-word"" in this film, which is sort of like a gold-standard ""No-No"" in these ""walking corpses"" stories, but I could excuse that as little more than an unpleasant irritant and nothing nearly as serious as throwing all of the NotLD/Romero references up in our faces.Despite those two things, which I consider major gut-punches which are big enough distractions to pull me out of the mood temporarily, I still found myself enjoying this movie far more than when I had after my first viewing, and I've now come to believe that if we would allow ourselves to see this movie for the reinterpretation and subtle satire that it truly is, and leave our prejudices at the door because of being so enamored with the original story that we will not allow ourselves to be entertained with a different take on what has become a classic, we might actually find out that what we were presented with here was both clever and quite entertaining.",4,Check Your *PREJUDICES* At The Door!,1404950400,"07 10, 2014",2014,3917,"['Too', 'many', 'people',

1092463,A13QNGUB9IYTY4,B000TXPXC8,"A Hermit ""J.Hamric""","[2, 5]","I watched this dud at my brother's place, didn't know what to expect, but being a zombie movie, and one with Sid Haig at that, we all watched it. We got some free 3-D glasses at Walgreens, but that just nullifies the color. It would've worked if the the film were in black-and-white, but instead, it just made our eyes feel funny for a while.Sometimes a bad movie is good, look at ""Evil Dead."" Not-so-good acting in spots, cheesy script, way over-the-top gore effects, and so on, but that is a low-budget classic, as most classics seem to be low-budget. But not this one. No-no-no-noooo. It has the obligatory puke scene, a guy spitting cream of mushroom soup on the floor, totally unnecessary, the standard boob-shot; ever since Friday The 13th, you seem to need to have a nude, nubile young woman to look at, it helps you forget what a lame ""object"" this is. Grossness and sex scenes are fine, if they have something to do with the plot, but in a travesty like this, they only seem to distract from the film's failings. And there are many. The dialogue is forced and poorly written, and even laughable. The original 1968 film by George Romero is on the TV in the house, and one of the characters is babbling on about how they are all cursed from watching it. You know, ""Night Of The Living Dead."" And in this particular dud, all the character's names from the original film are the names of the characters here. You see the segment where the zombies finally break into the house from Romero's ""Night Of The Living Dead,"" and it seems the film makers here were using it a carrot-stick to lure new viewers into experiencing this particular movie.Like I said earlier, in ""Friday The 13th,"" or even John Carpenter's ""Halloween,"" for that matter, the characters were sexually active, but the way these were written, it does tie in with the story. In films like this one, though (and there are a lot of them), every casting call invariably finds at least one or two shapely young ladies to take it off, and unless it is a pivotal part of the script, sometimes I feel like a voyuer watching them. You know the type. They come drunk, saying things like ""Guess how many boobs I saw today? Fifteen!"" (thank you Homer Simpson for that one). And I am convinced, it is only to distract from the failings of such a film.These ramblings were strictly my own, I can only give you my opinion about this waste of time and money.

Nothing at all. You'd think that as the film progressed, there would be at least SOME glimmer of hope for us viewers, but no. It just got worse and worse, like Sid Haig's career.The filmmakers didn't even throw us any relief other than one naked blonde with a dumpy body and gore as revolting or terrifying as a fluffy teddy bear.Luckily, there were at least a couple of laughs. Unfortunately, it was at the film's expense. . . not actually humour.Cell phones! What's that you say? No one had a cell phone in this day & age? Well, apparently the idiot owner of the house is convinced that they'll give you cancer. And something about Bin Laden I didn't really catch. His house, his rules. . . But, correct me if I'm wrong. . . wasn't Barbra texting her brother about twenty minutes ago? Did I miss her dropping it? Or a zombie eating it? Another thing I don't really understand. . . before Barbra got there, they were watching Night of the Living Dead (the original). . .Isn't it odd that NO ONE would take any advice from the film when the zombies starting attacking their farmhouse? ""Let me unload a clip into this zombie's chest, then stare at it when it doesn't die."" C'mon, man! Get with the program! No one realizes the teensy similarities between their lives and the movie? Like, I dunno. . . their names? OR THE FACT THE ZOMBIES ARE ATTACKING THEIR HOUSE?! Jeez. . .Another great piece of dialogue: ""Don't worry, if I'm going to shoot him, I'll shoot him in his *beep* foot."" Now. . . if you're trying to threaten someone's life at gunpoint and they're in earshot, you probably shouldn't say you're not ACTUALLY going to kill them, right? Not with Mr. Slicked-Back-Hair.- - -Anyway, to sum, avoid this film. Really. It was made at the expense of an error which negatively impacts the greatest horror director of all time, George A.

I watched the trailer, loved the zombies, then vowed that one night soon after my wife and kids went to bed, I'd indulge in a world of darkness and gore while hiding out in an old farmhouse.The problem was: I got busy, so when I finally got around to my late-night television watching, I was too tired to watch a full movie and since the on-demand rental would only be for 24 hours, there wouldn't be any other time to watch this flick other than, well, right when I rented it.So the suspense built. One day turned to two. Two to four. Four to eight, till eventually a few weeks passed, me all the while unable to stop thinking about this film. Then . . . finally--finally--I was able to watch this thing. The only problem was it was an over-the-cables rental so no 3D for me. Oh well.I loved how it started out like the original Night of the Living Dead (that was 1968, for those who don't know). The opening scene in the cemetery immediately brought back memories of the original and the same kind of eeriness. Then the zombies showed up; I was all giggles and my inner undead fanboy was a happy camper.Right then I knew I was in for a good time. And I had a good time. The zombie scenes were great. The dead were just plain gross, each in various states of decay. The blood was plentiful and Sid Haig as Gerald Tovar Jr. did a great job of being that creepy, hick kind of guy that would bother anyone. And I gotta tell you, I didn't see the twist in the storyline coming. I won't spoil it, but those who've seen this movie know what I'm talking about.This movie is one of those great-yet-not flicks. You love it because it's all blood and guts, zombies and definitely a B-movie. You have a problem with it because the story is kind of ""meh"" and the acting is all right. At the same time you can't stop thinking about it afterward because--since it's a remake--it brings back gushy memories of the original (and in this case the original and the 1990 remake), but at the same time you wonder how it got off the rails so badly.That said, I'm giving it a split rating, the idea here being you can go either way on this, but at the very least be in for a good time, especially if you dig B-horror.A.P.

1092466,A34A7QEBMYTALW,B000TXPXC8,"Arthur Kicker ""Ragged, Tagged, and Bodybagged""","[24, 28]","Ingredients for a horrible horror movie remake:  horrid acting, terrible dialogue, terrible cinematography, a complete lack of gore, and a complete disrespect for the source material.  This remake of 'Night Of The Living Dead' has all of those in spades...plus a ton of really crappy 3-D and oh, Ben isn't black in this one.  Ugh.  Terrible.  Let me start by saying that I love the original and I also really like Tom Savini's 1990 remake, so my opinion may be a bit skewed.  But this remake is absolutely horrid.First off, the acting is the quality of a high school drama class.  Everyone in the film is terrible.  Even Sid Haig, who is normally great, phones it in.  All the characters are unlikeable, especially the ""hero"" Ben, who is now played by some white emo kid.  He's not rough and tough like Duane Jones in the original or world weary like Tony Todd in the 1990 version.  White Ben is just there, stumbling through his lines like a confused drama student.Secondly, the 3-D in the film is pointless and terrible.  The film has some decent 3-D shots in the opening graveyard scene but then fails to really do anything with it for the rest of the film.  Instead of trying to create depth in the shots, the filmmakers shot the bulk of the film like a regular movie.  They make a couple half-hearted attempts, but there is not a single shot that jumps out at you(the slo-mo bullet effect near the end of the film is pathetic).  But whatever, I could've dealt with it if it were not for the fact the the 3-D is just bad.  With the glasses on, everything is just blurry.  And unfortunately, there's no function on the disc that allows you to turn the 3-D off.  You get to either watch a blurry film with the glasses off or a blurry film with the glasses on.Third, I just don't feel that the team behind the film really had any love the source material.  I heard an interview with the director, Jeff Broadstreet, a while back on the now defunct 'Pickled Embryo' podcast.  He basically said that he's not a horror movie fan nor has he ever made a horror film.  He was picked by the financers of the film because in the past he almost one time made a 3-D film.  The brains behind the money picked a director who was passionless for the horror genre and passionless for the original film.  But at least he almost made a 3-D film one time.Fourth, there was a complete lack of gore.  I'm not saying that it needed to be all 'Dead Alive' or anything.  But a horror movie about zombies with hardly any violence in it?  Sad.  And then wait till you see the ending...

1092468,A3GKMQFL05Z79K,B000TXPXC8,blackaciddevil,"[0, 0]","For this to be a reimagining of the 1968 classic by George A. Romero(The original film was never properly copyrighted and fell into the public domain, making this remake possible with no permission from the original's creators), it started off pretty well. I could get into the modernizing of the older classic by making subtle changes to the characters and whatnot but, when they brought in the character of Gerald Tovar, JR. and his backstory to the equation, that's when they lost me. Not that I'm criticizing Sid Haig's performance, I'm not. His acting was great as were all the others. It's just that the Gerald Tovar, JR. backstory really had no place in this remake. I can think of several ways that improvement could be made on Romero's classic, none of them having anything to do with an outside character. What made the original and the first remake so great was the feeling of isolation you got from your surroundings, that was another mistake in this film. I had a hard time feeling as though I was far away from anywhere in this movie in the way it was told. If Director Jeff Broadstreet had stuck to the basics in this movie(quite like Tom Savini did in his 1990 remake), he would have made a 'worthy' Zombie flick worth adding to your collection. I liked his vision cinematically. As it stands, it is nothing more than B-movie fodder. In my opinion, at least.In this new interpretation, Barb and Johnny arrive late for the burial of their aunt and find a zombie outbreak in progress. Barb flees the cemetery and is rescued by Ben, a local college student with a secret. The two seek refuge in the nearby marijuana farmhouse of the Cooper family, and attempt to live through the night along with other survivors, including the pyrophobic mortician, Gerald Tovar, Jr who makes his appearance during the latter third of the film.It started out good. I really wanted to like this film. If you can get past the ridiculous Gerald Tovar backstory, it's a pretty decent flick.

But there were elements that left me a little disappointed with the product.  I did enjoy it, though.The movie opens with clips from the opening scene of the original and also has sections of the movie where they are watching the original classic.  Whole scenes move forward with the original music and sounds from the original playing in the background.  I liked the idea, especially with the opening, but was a little miffed, as I knew George and the original cast and composer didn't see a dime of royalties.  I kind of felt like they took advantage of it.The zombies were top notch, in my opinion.  A key element in my enjoyment of zombie movies (read: do they look good).  I thought some of the camera angles they chose gave some great scares and provided that bit of anticipation when you see a zombie shamble into frame, even from a distance.The story was alright, but I wasn't expecting acadamy award winning writing, dialogue, or acting.  It was all pretty average, and a good story overall.The female lead was alright, apart from her looking like a slow child running from the zombies.  Sid Haig delivers a great moment during a monologue later in the movie.  I have to say it was a great moment in the flick.  Very real and truthful.  I'm interested in seeing his other work now.The ending was a huge letdown, and my only huge disappointment in the film.  Zombie stories should end with a bang, not a whimper.The movie is the standard variation on a theme, and one I wouldn't be ashamed to have in my zombie movie library.  There are much worse out there.

1092475,A2BQBLCKJHP65G,B000TXPXC8,"Eric Ericson ""RedSabbath""","[8, 8]","If I haven't said this before I'll say it again, I'm a huge fan of George A. Romero's Night Of The Living Dead and his sequels he's done for the past forty years. Thanks to him, we truly know the horrific world of Zombies and the Undead with great detail and know what a frightning place it can be trapped within, be it an old farmhouse, a suburban mall, underground bunker, or anyplace that leaves you open for an attack by the flesheaters of the living. Of course once you create such a popular character in Horror you get copycat rip-off's trying to cash-in on your original creation. Strangely though, most of these types of films have had some varied degrees of success, most notably the Italian Zombi filmakers of the 1980's. Unfortunately though, the one that started it all, 1968's NOTLD, due to a copyright snafu never got that precious right and soon it came clear to all that anyone could either release it, own it, and/or make any version with that plot and title any way they choose.But first, a little history: back in 1998 Anchor Bay and John A. Russo (one of the men to help create the '68 original with Romero) decided to release a 30th Anniversary version of the classic, but instead of just re-releasing the same old print like every other DVD company, shot and added new footage in with the old, creating a new subplot that not only hurts the original film, but betrays the social commentary that was laid down in the first place. A true misstep and the fans were not pleased.However when it came to complete remakes, at least someone got it right even before this. In 1990, with Romero's personal guidance and FX genius Tom Savini at the helm, they made a Night Of The Living Dead that stayed close to the original script giving those 90's audiences an update that not only they could be proud of, but better in some aspects of gore and production values. So after one well-done remake & one learning mistake in what not to do to a classic, could it ever be re-done again?Apparently not. In 2006, with director Jeff ""Corman Wanna-Be"" Broadstreet in the chair, they decided to give it a go again, of course without any needed consent by Romero, but this time with a twist: Let's try to make it in 3D! 3D? Really? Sounds like a curious idea, but it truly falls flat here.To be blunt NOTLD3D is a travesty. Shot on a non-existent budget, this has to be the worse ""reimagining"" of a movie since 2001's Planet Of The Apes. Sure, most of your favorite characters are here, but this time mixed around and played by actors who are so stiff, it's hard to tell them from the actual zombies. And the story is so slow and boring that it seems like a 3am viewing of something you'd expect to see on Sci-Fi Channel. Also, while the gore factor on the '68 original was minimal at best, 36 years later you still don't see much, if anything at all, but not for MPAA reasons but financial ones, and in fact halfway through it I wondered why was this rated ""R' in the first place. It's new plot-twists were lame, the sets boring, and the cameo by newly crowned Horror icon Sid Haig (who in my opinion isn't that big of a deal in the first place) is completely unnecessary that only helps in establishing that this was the ultimate in movie cash-ins.So it's main appeal has to be it's 3D, right? Wrong. Instead of using 3D's latest technology Stereoscopic (that's with the ""shades of gray""), they went with the outdated Anaglyphic type (red/blue) which in turn turns the entire movie into a purplish-hue mess. And don't expect anything to ""jump"" out at you. When it does work, and it's rare, it only gives backgrounds depth, meaning it makes your image look deeper, not closer. Also it should be noted, outside of the behind-the-scenes features, this whole disc is in 3D, meaning that without the glasses, it's unwatchable. There is NO 2D version on the disc included like it should have been (that version is released separately), so once those glasses go it's the ultimate coaster.So to sum up, bad movie, bad 3D, bad idea.

1092477,A1SHNOU2ODKIDG,B000TXPXC8,Gregorio,"[1, 4]","Of the many bad horror remakes we have been subjected to in the last few years, this one stands out as one of the very few good ones, in fact, it is probably the best of all of them.  Of course any film that features Sid Haig is on the right path from the start but this film has a lot more going for it than just this esteemed actor.  The script takes many different turns from the original but manages to remain intellegent and well thought out while keeping a sense of humor (but the humor never goes over the top).  The cast is likable and effective, especially the two principal characters of Barb (Brianna Brown) and Ben (Joshua Desroches).  There is a great music soundtrack and some very good zombie makeup.  The film is surprisingly restrained in its visual effects, although there are several satisfyingly gory ones, but I beleive the true star of this film is the 3D.  This is the traditional red and blue glasses style of 3D.  I wish someone would do a film in the type of 3D that was popular for a short time in the 80's where the 3D glasses were clear and the colors were natural.  That was a far superior process to the red and blue, but I have to say that this is the best 3D of this type I have seen, far surpassing what was done on FREDDY's DEAD or any of the others.  This 3D really works well and the film turns into a fairly surreal experience when you watch it in a dark room on a large screen (and sit directly in the center for the best effect).  /  As well as the film being great, the DVD is very generous with the extras including a commentary with the director, producer, writer, and Sid.  There is a making of documentary as well as a seperate featurette on the 3D process.  There is a fun question and answer session with the writers and Sid from the New Beverly Cinema.  There are trailers, bloopers, a 3D image gallery etc.  LOTS of good extras.  They even give you FOUR pairs of 3D glasses instead of the usual two that come with DVDs.  All in all, this is a great experience.  YES it is different than  the original but why remake the original on a shot for shot basis?  It is already a classic and does not need to be remade.  This new film is a truly different approach that stands on its own.  It is also superior, in my opinion, to the Savini remake. And the opening title sequence is AMAZING and very clever.

Why then would you even try to tackle a classic such as this unless you plan to up the level?  This is now the 2nd remake of the film, the 1st remake done by effects wizard Tom Savini (with Romero's blessing) was perfect & did what needed to be done to refresh the already classic original.  This new one tries to add & change things here & there & really was pointless to've been made.  Granted, I only watched the 2D version of the film, but I can't imagine it being in 3D making it any better.  The other thing missing from this film is the political satire that made all of Romero's films so great to begin with.  I wouldn't normally do this, but here's the plot of the film so you don't have to bother with it yourself:Sid Haig plays a Mortician who's recently taken over his recently deceased father's mortuary.  Apparently Sid has issues with cremating bodies & rather than doing so has been stock piling bodies in the mortuary.  This is where all the zombies come from, as they're to weak to dig out from their graves as described by the film.  Barbera & her brother go to meet their mother for a funeral (not their mother's funeral) & are attacked, the brother drives off & leaves Barbera who's eventually picked up by ""motorcycle punching"" (& very white, not that I see color LOL) Ben & then taken to an old house for shelter.  This is no regular house, as it turns out the house's home owner is a ""grower"" & ""When"" (White Ben) is a drug dealer.  Anyway, unfotunately there's no conflict in the house other than no one believing her & not wanting to call the police because they're drug dealers.  Everyone knows everyone cause they're all hippy pot smokers, not different families trying to find shelter.  This is really too bad, as this was one of the things that made the original so scary, cause you weren't safe in or outside the house.  Anyway, the end of the movie winds up in the mortuary, with Sid Haig being the real villain of the film with a cheezy mad doctor kinda feel.  The acting is decent, but nothing to write home about, and the make-up/special effects are amatuerish at best.  If you're a fan of the original, I strongly suggest staying away from this & just pretend it doesn't exist.  There maybe something special to get out of the movie with the 3D glasses, but judging from the other reviewer I very much doubt it.  If you want a truely great new Zombie film destined to be a classic check out ""Fido"".  Aproach ""NOTLD3D"" with extreme caution!!!

So for those who like a bit more in depth review, I sound off on N.O.T.L.D 3D. The story itself, it's okay but not great. The script could have had a little more meat on it's bones.. But it wasn't the most terrible movie I have ever watched. The acting, cheesey in parts, better in other places. Were there some dumb ad on's to this remake..sure. But it had an element of likeability just the same. The FX, the zombies looked fairly well, some were pretty scary looking actully.. I like a more rotted, evil looking zombie.. and this movie pulled that off pretty well. The 3D.. If you're looking for zombies to reach out into your living room, it won't happen here. Some of the back ground depth shots were really nice and made the grade. More of this kind of effect should have been done throughout the movie.

There's nobody there for the viewer to care about. In this genre it is ESSENTIAL that characters are empathetic. Forget it!c) Bad actors.

It might sound a bit strange combination after watching two Robert Rodriguez family-oriented 3-D films, but horror films are not alien to 3-D gimmick. You may remember ""House of Wax"" starring Vincent Price made more than 50 years ago, so the idea itself is not bad.As to the new film's 3-D effects, I agree with other reviewers - they are exactly what you expect from these old-fashioned, blue-and-red glasses. It is not directed by James Cameron and you should know that. I only wish that the filmmakers, as Rodriguez wisely did, had shortened the 3-D effect time (with captions telling viewers when to wear or take off the glasses). 80 minutes of watching a film through my red/blue glasses was really killing my eyes.The updated version has a basically same plot. It's about a group of people trapped in a farmhouse besieged by flesh-eating undeads. This is basic of this genre and this film also sticks to it, but the results lack tension and suspense because of the amount of talk which is too much, and the dearth of gores. Some zombie effects are impressive (like the one crawling in the yard), but not enough to make up the slow tempo and slack pace.One great thing you can find here is, as you expect, Sid Haig.

1092498,A2ONX15N6TWDR,B000TXPXC8,Vincenzo L.,"[1, 1]","Every now and then a movie comes along that defies the conventional; it breaks the rules, and remains with several generations of people as a well-loved film.  Why people feel a need to 'remake' such films goes well beyond my level of understanding.  George Romero cemented himself in the annals of film and horror history with Night of the Living Dead... I almost understood Tom Savini's desire to make a remake back in 1990, but this... this just defies all logic.  This movie is from far the worst zombie movie I've ever seen, but when you give the NotLD title to a film, it had better stack up... especially if you tack a '3D' to it.The cast for this film is totally wrong, Sid Haig (who I remember as the villain from Jayson of Star Command) has made a brilliant comeback in the horror industry, but even he could not save this film from becoming the waste that it is.  Giving the same names to this cast as the original does not justify dubbing it a 'remake'.  Better that they would have named the film and the characters something altogether different and let us formulate our own opinions instead of trying to ride the coat tails of the greatest horror film of its day!The acting is stiff, something akin to a High School Drama class, and the makeup is woefully inadequate.  What movie makers fail to grasp is that with zombies, no great amount of effects are necessary if the zombies are 'fresh'... and as Hitchcock proved time and again, you can do more with less and make it even scarier.This was little more than a cheap knock off taking advantage of Romero's classic film to try and lure unsuspecting viewers to their enjoyment doom.

Sid Haig seemed pretty bored while doing this movie and just showed up for the paycheck.2) PRODUCTION: For a movie that ACTUALLY went to the theaters, I was kind of surprised that this wasn't done as good as it could've been. I would've rather the money that was spent on the mediocre 3D effects be spent on the actual film and turned this into a much better production. It all came off as kind of amatuerish, which was disappointing. Sadly, I have read numerous articles where the writer and director have both said that they were TOLD to do specific things in this movie by the company that footed the budget and could not stray from those instructions. That company is Taurus Entertainment. In my opinion, it seems that this company is just interested in passing off mediocre shlock for a quick buck. (They also were behind a disappointing sequel to ANOTHER Romero movie, Day of the Dead 2: Contagium.) While this movie bombed at the box office, I'm sure that with DVD sales and international profits, Taurus will have more than made their initial budget back, despite the complaints of moviegoers everywhere.3) ZOMBIES: These zombies (as you would imagine) are ""Romero Shamblers,"" but with a little more mean in them. The make up for the zombies varied from discolored faces and special eye contacts to many facial applications. The zombies didn't look all that bad. And they eat their victims. Nothing new here.4) THE CAUSE: Man made.5) NUDITY: Tom and Judy in barn getting it on when the zombies attack. Tom manages to get his drawers on, yet Judy stands there and screams and then runs around outside from the zombies and finally locks herself in Tom's truck...completely nude.Sadly, I tried to like this. I don't hate it; I'm just bothered by how bad it is. A lot of it had to due with the title. I know a lot of people will hate it just because it's a remake / re-imagining of a classic. I personally think if it was called ""When Zombies Attack Rural Areas,"" it probably would've been received as just another lousy zombie movie. But to try and take on Romero and then do it badly, creates a lot of grief. Especially, when parts of the movie are totally changed or left out completely. NotLD was remade once in the 1990's and was pretty good. Another version of NotLD wasn't needed.RATING: 2 out of 5",2,A review from Zombiefans!,1194566400,"11 9, 2007",2007,2430,"['really', 'wanted', 'like', 'one', '1', 'acting', 'was', 'passable', 'really', 'bad', 'stand', 'outs', 'nothing', 'incredible', 'either', 'Sid', 'Haig', 'seemed', 'pretty', 'bored', 'doing', 'movie', 'just', 'showed', 'up', 'paycheck.2', 'PRODUCTION', 'movie', 'ACTUALLY', 'went', 'theaters', 'was', 'kind', 'surprised', 'was', ""n't"", 'done', 'as', 'good', 'could', ""'ve"", 'been', 'would', ""'ve"", 'rather', 'money', 'was', 'spent', 'mediocre', '3D', 'effects', 'be', 'spent', 'actual', 'film', 'turned', 'much', 'better', 'production', 'came', 'off', 'kind', 'amatuerish', 'was', 'disappointing', 'Sadly', 'have', 'read', 'numerous', 'articles', 'where', 'writer', 'director', 'have', 'said', 'were', 'TOLD', 'do', 'specific', 'things', 'movie', 'company', 'footed', 'budget', 'could', 'not', 'stray', 'instructions', 'company', 'Taurus', 'Entertainment', 'opinion', 'company', 'just', 'interested', 'passing', 'off', 'mediocre', 'shlock', 'quick', 'buck', 'also', 'were', 'disappointing', 'sequel', 'ANOTHER', 'Romero', 'movie', 'Day', 'Dead', '2', 'Contagium', 'movie', 'bombed', 'box', 'office', ""'m"", 'sure', 'DVD', 'sales', 'international', 'profits', 'Taurus', 'will', 'have', 'more', 'made', 'initial', 'budget', 'back', 'complaints', 'moviegoers', 'everywhere.3', 'ZOMBIES', 'zombies', 'would', 'imagine', 'are', 'Romero', 'Shamblers', 'little', 'more', 'mean', 'make', 'up', 'zombies', 'varied', 'discolored', 'special', 'eye', 'contacts', 'many', 'facial', 'applications', 'zombies', 'did', ""n't"", 'look', 'bad', 'eat', 'victims', 'Nothing', 'new', 'here.4', 'THE', 'CAUSE', 'Man', 'made.5', 'NUDITY', 'Tom', 'Judy', 'barn', 'getting', 'when', 'zombies', 'attack', 'Tom', 'get', 'drawers', 'yet', 'Judy', 'screams', 'then', 'runs', 'zombies', 'finally', 'locks', 'Tom', 'truck', 'completely', 'nude.Sadly', 'tried', 'like', 'do', ""n't"", 'hate', ""'m"", 'just', 'bothered', 'how', 'bad', 'lot', 'had', 'due', 'title', 'know', 'lot', 'people', 'will', 'hate', 'just', 'remake', '/', 're-imagining', 'classic', 'personally', 'think', 'was', 'called', 'When', 'Zombies', 'Attack', 'Rural', 'Areas', 'probably', 'would', ""'ve"", 'been', 'received', 'just', 'lousy', 'zombie', 'movie', 'try', 'take', 'Romero', 'then', 'do', 'badly', 'lot', 'grief', 'Especially', 'when', 'parts', 'movie', 'are', 'totally', 'changed', 'left', 'out', 'completely', 'NotLD', 'was', 'remade', 'once', '1990', 'was', 'pretty', 'good', 'version', 'NotLD', 'was', ""n't"", 'needed.RATING', '2', '5']",Night Of The Living Dead
