One part teen horror, one part necrophilic shocker... It would seem that BENEATH THE DARKNESS has much to offer the Horror audience, but this tame and tired thriller fails to spark even the least amount of interest. Dennis Quaid plays a rather weak villain. He is neither creepy nor intimidating, and often looks silly while attempting to be either. No one in the angst-ridden cast of annoying teen stereotypes even remotely comes forward as the film's hero, and they instead form a group of anti-heroes that break into the poor man's house without reason and get what they have coming to them. With no compelling characters, a questionable plot, minimal shocks, and only a handful of bloodless murders, BENEATH THE DARKNESS becomes a tedious viewing experience. It cribs nearly its entire structure from D.J. Caruso's DISTURBIA, but doesn't think to steal either its humor or suspense.

1510205,A3TF2PFLJ1ZU3A,B0064SVNAI,DW,"[1, 2]","I suppose if you are of Aimee Teegarden's generation, this might be more up your alley.  It may seem harsh I gave it three stars.  I can't put this at four or five, there are too many others of this genre that far surpass it.The first thing I didn't like about the film was how they spent so much time concentrating on building the character of Travis, with the background story of his sister dying in their youth.  There was never a way to tie this in with the Character of Ely (Quaid)losing his wife (although Ely does mention the connection) and towards the latter part of the film, even particularly with the ""revelation"" Travis has in the hospital remembering his sister's death, it has really no significance.  If this was important, then why not tie it in more with the first man (jogger with dog) who is brought into the plot in a big way, only to be nothing more than an afterthought in the film?  The cops act serious and look tough, but are presented as ridiculous clowns so as to allow the teens to appear cunning and resourceful.  The very psyche of Ely never really can be taken seriously, and even when everyone is bungling in and around his home and finding nothing (in order to provide him with more time) it ultimately is too light in any one area.  The sum does not equal the parts here.  Quaid, as always, helps a poor script with his very screen presence, and Teegarden can at least for now, always fill the role of the tough but troubled teenage girl.  Overall, worth a redbox rental if you have nothing else to watch...but bring coffee along with the popcorn.  It's pacing is slow when it should be fast, and fast (like every scene inside the house) when it should be much more thorough in creating tense, frightening moments or areas of discovery...which ultimately become all too predictable.",3,Thriller Lite has little substance,1331164800,"03 8, 2012",2012,1817,"['suppose', 'are', 'Aimee', 'Teegarden', 'generation', 'might', 'be', 'more', 'alley', 'may', 'seem', 'harsh', 'gave', 'three', 'stars', 'ca', ""n't"", 'put', 'four', 'five', 'are', 'too', 'many', 'others', 'genre', 'far', 'it.The', 'first', 'thing', 'did', ""n't"", 'like', 'film', 'was', 'how', 'spent', 'so', 'much', 'time', 'concentrating', 'building', 'character', 'Travis', 'background', 'story', 'sister', 'dying', 'youth', 'was', 'never', 'way', 'tie', 'Character', 'Ely', 'Quaid', 'losing', 'wife', 'Ely', 'mention', 'connection', 'latter', 'part', 'film', 'even', 'particularly', 'revelation', 'Travis', 'hospital', 'remembering', 'sister', 'death', 'really', 'significance', 'was', 'important', 'then', 'why', 'not', 'tie', 'more', 'first', 'man', 'jogger', 'dog', 'who', 'brought', 'plot', 'big', 'way', 'only', 'be', 'nothing', 'more', 'afterthought', 'film', 'cops', 'act', 'serious', 'look', 'tough', 'are', 'presented', 'ridiculous', 'clowns', 'so', 'allow', 'teens', 'appear', 'cunning', 'resourceful', 'very', 'psyche', 'Ely', 'never', 'really', 'can', 'be', 'taken', 'seriously', 'even', 'when', 'everyone', 'bungling', 'home', 'finding', 'nothing', 'order', 'provide', 'more', 'time', 'ultimately', 'too', 'light', 'one', 'area', 'sum', 'not', 'equal', 'parts', 'here', 'Quaid', 'always', 'poor', 'script', 'very', 'screen', 'presence', 'Teegarden', 'can', 'least', 'now', 'always', 'fill', 'role', 'tough', 'troubled', 'teenage', 'girl', 'Overall', 'redbox', 'rental', 'have', 'nothing', 'else', 'watch', 'bring', 'coffee', 'popcorn', 'pacing', 'slow', 'when', 'should', 'be', 'fast', 'fast', 'scene', 'house', 'when', 'should', 'be', 'much', 'more', 'thorough', 'creating', 'tense', 'frightening', 'moments', 'areas', 'discovery', 'ultimately', 'become', 'too', 'predictable']",Beneath the Darkness
1510206,A1D2C0WDCSHUWZ,B0064SVNAI,"E. A Solinas ""ea_solinas""","[1, 1]","Ah, American gothic -- small towns with ugly secrets, and ""ordinary"" people who have gruesome habits where no one is looking.Nowhere is this genre wasted more than in ""Beneath the Darkness."" This resolutely dull American gothic has an intriguing premise, but induces more snores than scares. This is the kind of movie that should be overflowing with dark, quirky humor -- but instead we get a slow, vague ""thriller"" with no twists or unexpected events. Everything interesting is revealed in the first half hour.Ely (Dennis Quaid) is a well-loved football-star-turned-mortician in a small Texas town, but ever since his wife Rosemary died, he has become a weird recluse. Little do the townspeople realize that he's all too happy to kidnap people he dislikes at gunpoint and bury them alive in coffins. That's not a spoiler -- he does that in the opening scene, in explicit detail.But one night a bunch of teens, including the troubled Travis (Tony Oller) and pretty Abby (Aimee Teegarden), break into his house -- and after they find a woman's corpse in Ely's bed, he kills one of them. But the police refuse to believe anything bad about Ely, so the teens must find another way of exposing Ely's murderous streak. The problem is, it might just get them killed...""Beneath the Darkness"" sounds kind of like a dark comedy, probably with lots of death and over-the-top absurdities. Maybe some ""Tucker and Dale Vs. Evil"" splattergore. If it had turned out that way, it might have been a fun movie. Instead, director Martin Guigui plays the entire thing painfully straight -- the only dark humor is from Quaid's hamtastic villain performance.So instead of fleshing out the thin plot with something amusing, Guigui grinds slowly through a painfully tedious plot. He just throws in some cliched subplots, most of which feel like they were transplanted from another movie -- there's a subplot about Travis seeing a dark specter over his dying sister's bedside, which is never explained and has NOTHING to do with the main story.Quaid clearly knew this movie was a stinker, because he gives a hamtasmagorical performance here -- he's all grinning, cackling, mocking cheese, and his final moments in the movie derail what COULD have been a creepy ending. Then again, Ely is not as creepy as Guigui clearly thinks he is, since his ""dark secret"" is cribbed from superior thrillers.There is one good quality to the movie, though -- the younger actors are actually pretty decent. Oller, Teegarden, Stephen Lunsford and Devon Werkheiser all give the best performances they can, and their characters do occasionally rise above the usual high school stereotypes like ""dumb jock"" or ""best friend.""""Beneath the Darkness"" isn't horrifying, just horribly tedious. Dennis Quaid's hamfest of a performance provides some unintentional comedy, but just about everything else is just dull, slow and lackluster.",2,Love sucks,1367625600,"05 4, 2013",2013,2883,"['Ah', 'American', 'gothic', 'small', 'towns', 'ugly', 'secrets', 'ordinary', 'people', 'who', 'have', 'gruesome', 'habits', 'where', 'one', 'looking.Nowhere', 'genre', 'wasted', 'more', 'Darkness', 'resolutely', 'dull', 'American', 'gothic', 'intriguing', 'premise', 'more', 'snores', 'scares', 'kind', 'movie', 'should', 'be', 'overflowing', 'dark', 'quirky', 'humor', 'instead', 'get', 'slow', 'vague', 'thriller', 'twists', 'unexpected', 'events', 'Everything', 'interesting', 'revealed', 'first', 'half', 'hour.Ely', 'Dennis', 'Quaid', 'well-loved', 'football-star-turned-mortician', 'small', 'Texas', 'town', 'ever', 'wife', 'Rosemary', 'died', 'become', 'weird', 'recluse', 'Little', 'do', 'townspeople', 'realize', 'too', 'happy', 'kidnap', 'people', 'gunpoint', 'bury', 'alive', 'coffins', 'not', 'spoiler', 'opening', 'scene', 'explicit', 'detail.But', 'one', 'night', 'bunch', 'teens', 'including', 'troubled', 'Travis', 'Tony', 'Oller', 'pretty', 'Abby', 'Aimee', 'Teegarden', 'break', 'house', 'find', 'woman', 'corpse', 'Ely', 'bed', 'one', 'police', 'refuse', 'believe', 'anything', 'bad', 'Ely', 'teens', 'must', 'find', 'way', 'exposing', 'Ely', 'murderous', 'streak', 'problem', 'might', 'just', 'get', 'killed', 'Darkness', 'kind', 'dark', 'comedy', 'probably', 'lots', 'death', 'over-the-top', 'absurdities', 'Maybe', 'Tucker', 'Dale', 'Vs', 'Evil', 'splattergore', 'had', 'turned', 'out', 'way', 'might', 'have', 'been', 'fun', 'movie', 'Instead', 'director', 'Martin', 'Guigui', 'entire', 'thing', 'painfully', 'straight', 'only', 'dark', 'humor', 'Quaid', 'hamtastic', 'villain', 'performance.So', 'instead', 'fleshing', 'out', 'thin', 'plot', 'something', 'amusing', 'Guigui', 'slowly', 'painfully', 'tedious', 'plot', 'just', 'cliched', 'subplots', 'most', 'feel', 'were', 'transplanted', 'movie', 'subplot', 'Travis', 'seeing', 'dark', 'specter', 'dying', 'sister', 'bedside', 'never', 'explained', 'NOTHING', 'do', 'main', 'story.Quaid', 'clearly', 'knew', 'movie', 'was', 'stinker', 'hamtasmagorical', 'performance', 'here', 'grinning', 'cackling', 'mocking', 'cheese', 'final', 'moments', 'movie', 'derail', 'what', 'COULD', 'have', 'been', 'creepy', 'ending', 'Then', 'again', 'Ely', 'not', 'as', 'creepy', 'Guigui', 'clearly', 'dark', 'secret', 'cribbed', 'superior', 'one', 'good', 'quality', 'movie', 'though', 'younger', 'actors', 'are', 'actually', 'pretty', 'decent', 'Oller', 'Teegarden', 'Stephen', 'Lunsford', 'Devon', 'Werkheiser', 'give', 'best', 'performances', 'can', 'characters', 'do', 'occasionally', 'rise', 'usual', 'high', 'school', 'stereotypes', 'dumb', 'jock', 'best', 'friend', 'Darkness', ""n't"", 'horrifying', 'just', 'horribly', 'tedious', 'Dennis', 'Quaid', 'hamfest', 'performance', 'unintentional', 'comedy', 'just', 'everything', 'else', 'just', 'dull', 'slow', 'lackluster']",Beneath the Darkness
1510207,A2IY9M330NKBW6,B0064SVNAI,Eric Sanberg,"[2, 3]","In my mind, scripts and dialogue, for both theatrical and TV, overall, have gotten better over the years. Looking at ""Justified"", ""The Closer"", ""Deadwood"" et al, it's an easy point to make. But when you see this stinker you can't help but wonder who was at the helm. How can they have taken a decent plot line and screwed it up so entirely with clumsy points and rotten dialogue.Here's the scoop. Some teens in a Texas town think something is wrong at the house of the local mortician (Dennis Quaid). Is the house haunted? Is something else afoot? One night they break into the house to check things out. They see something they shouldn't and Quaid kills one of the group. He tells the authorities the kid fell and no one will believe the rest of them because they're kids who were committing a crime. Now it's up to the survivors to set things straight.The producers must have put all their money on Quaid because pretty much everything else is doo-doo. It's a cross somewhere between ""Halloween"" and ""Psycho"", but neither is done justice. The night scenes (and there are many) are so dark the screen goes almost entirely black. And I have decent gear to view with. The characters are little more than cardboard. Brett Cullen is Okay as the sheriff but there isn't enough there to save it. The dialogue is just awful and some of the plot points are so clumsy it's nearly unbelievable. It's a shame because the story outline is decent to the point that it could have been worked into a truly frightening film.So Quaid collects a paycheck. The kids do what they can with the sub-prime script and all potential gets flushed down the toilet. They should use this in a class for would-be film makers as a project on how it could be made better.

Lately, it seems like he plays the same scarred, emotionless character, over and over again. It's hard to remember that it's his charisma that made him a star and you can really see it in Beneath The Darkness. Dennis Quaid plays Vaughn Ely, a mortician who is bat shit crazy. To the town, Ely is this great guy who gives back to the community, but only one person can see him for what he really is. Travis (Tony Oller) is a local teenager who works odd jobs for Ely and has always had suspicions about the man, but never did anything about it. One night, the subject comes up while with his friends and they decide to bust into Ely's home to find out what he's really hiding. The story starts out very slowly and I wasn't expecting it to get any better, but it really does. I already mentioned how good Quaid is, but the star of this film is Tony Oller. I've heard him sing, but I've never seen him act, and to say I was impressed is an understatement. Between Quaid's outlandish behavior and Oller's teenage angst, I didn't need much of a story to follow in order to be entertained. Beneath The Darkness is strange and not everyone is going to like it, but it's one of these films that you keep watching, because you want to know what's going to happen. What happens is that it actually turns into a pretty entertaining and respectable film, that features a star in the making.",3,The Ultimate Movie Review! - (...) - @tss5078,1381017600,"10 6, 2013",2013,1459,"['great', 'finally', 'see', 'Dennis', 'Quaid', 'play', 'character', 'personality', 'again', 'Lately', 'same', 'scarred', 'emotionless', 'character', 'over', 'again', 'hard', 'remember', 'charisma', 'made', 'star', 'can', 'really', 'see', 'Beneath', 'Darkness', 'Dennis', 'Quaid', 'Vaughn', 'Ely', 'mortician', 'who', 'bat', 'shit', 'crazy', 'town', 'Ely', 'great', 'guy', 'who', 'back', 'community', 'only', 'one', 'person', 'can', 'see', 'what', 'really', 'Travis', 'Tony', 'Oller', 'local', 'teenager', 'who', 'odd', 'jobs', 'Ely', 'always', 'had', 'suspicions', 'man', 'never', 'did', 'anything', 'One', 'night', 'subject', 'up', 'friends', 'decide', 'bust', 'Ely', 'home', 'find', 'out', 'what', 'really', 'hiding', 'story', 'out', 'very', 'slowly', 'was', ""n't"", 'expecting', 'get', 'better', 'really', 'already', 'mentioned', 'how', 'good', 'Quaid', 'star', 'film', 'Tony', 'Oller', ""'ve"", 'heard', 'sing', ""'ve"", 'never', 'seen', 'act', 'say', 'was', 'impressed', 'understatement', 'Between', 'Quaid', 'outlandish', 'behavior', 'Oller', 'teenage', 'angst', 'did', ""n't"", 'need', 'much', 'story', 'follow', 'order', 'be', 'entertained', 'Darkness', 'strange', 'not', 'everyone', 'going', 'like', 'one', 'films', 'keep', 'watching', 'want', 'know', 'what', 'going', 'happen', 'What', 'actually', 'pretty', 'entertaining', 'respectable', 'film', 'star', 'making']",Beneath the Darkness

After thinking they saw a ghost a group of friends start to snoop around the home of local mortician Ely (Quaid). When they get caught something happens that changes their lives forever. Now with only their word it is up to them to convince the cops that the well liked Ely is actually a murderer. I had pretty high expectations for this movie. I really liked ""Mr. Brooks"" and I like Dennis Quaid and seeing him play a psycho I thought would be cool. Once again though like most movies the idea is better then the real thing. While Quaid was creepy the movie itself was very very slow moving and it took over 30 minutes for the movie to really begin. This is another movie where the ending is neat and worth it, but getting to the end is a struggle. This movie doesn't compare at all to ""Mr. Brooks"", but I would like to see Quaid in a better movie playing a character like this one. Overall, very slow and disappointing movie that had a lot of potential. I say C.",3,"Quaids character was neat to see, movie was not. Slow moving and seemed to go nowhere. End was OK.

Sounds like the beginning to a bad idea, huh? It gets worse when the kids see something and decide they need to know what it is, deciding it would be worth it to snoop around the next time said home owner is away.There is something about Dennis Quaid that makes him really creepy now. Its not simply acting - although it is really good - but maybe age or possibly years of acting that shines through in films like these. From the start he is out there being disturbing, too, and i liked that. This movie is powered by him, after all, and his character has to be believably disturbed and it is.While there are a few places in the beginning that are slow, and the ending of this film - No Spoilers - isn't the best thing in the world, I still liked it. The plot is not one that is complex at all and, as with a lot of horror movies, it can be figured out rather quickly. That said, the chase, the uncovering, the mistakes - those things make up a movie to me. And those kids earn a nice little ""why the hell are you doing that"" badge. The acting is good enough and I kept wondering exactly what Dennis Quaid would end up doing next. there are also a few points that I did not expect - the stairs thing for one - that made me enjoy this more.This is NOT going to overwhelm you as a film, and it shouldn't see that way. Simply watching the previews should tell you that you can figure it out fast. This is more like a character study off its medication, and I enjoy that. Quaid more than made up for any shortcomings for me.4/5",4,Never Try to Prove Ghosts Exist,1328918400,"02 11, 2012",2012,1632,"['groups', 'bored', 'teens', 'decide', 'spy', 'creepy', 'funeral', 'director', 'think', 'home', 'haunted', 'beginning', 'bad', 'idea', 'huh', 'worse', 'when', 'kids', 'see', 'something', 'decide', 'need', 'know', 'what', 'deciding', 'would', 'be', 'worth', 'snoop', 'next', 'time', 'said', 'home', 'owner', 'away.There', 'something', 'Dennis', 'Quaid', 'really', 'creepy', 'now', 'not', 'simply', 'acting', 'really', 'good', 'maybe', 'age', 'possibly', 'years', 'acting', 'shines', 'films', 'start', 'out', 'there', 'being', 'disturbing', 'too', 'i', 'liked', 'movie', 'powered', 'character', 'be', 'believably', 'disturbed', 'are', 'few', 'places', 'beginning', 'are', 'slow', 'ending', 'film', 'Spoilers', ""n't"", 'best', 'thing', 'world', 'still', 'liked', 'plot', 'not', 'one', 'complex', 'lot', 'horror', 'movies', 'can', 'be', 'figured', 'out', 'rather', 'quickly', 'said', 'chase', 'uncovering', 'mistakes', 'things', 'make', 'up', 'movie', 'kids', 'earn', 'nice', 'little', 'why', 'hell', 'are', 'doing', 'badge', 'acting', 'good', 'enough', 'kept', 'wondering', 'exactly', 'what', 'Dennis', 'Quaid', 'would', 'end', 'up', 'doing', 'next', 'are', 'also', 'few', 'points', 'did', 'not', 'expect', 'stairs', 'thing', 'one', 'made', 'enjoy', 'more.This', 'NOT', 'going', 'overwhelm', 'film', 'should', ""n't"", 'see', 'way', 'Simply', 'watching', 'previews', 'should', 'tell', 'can', 'figure', 'out', 'fast', 'more', 'character', 'study', 'medication', 'enjoy', 'Quaid', 'more', 'made', 'up', 'shortcomings', 'me.4/5']",Beneath the Darkness

A group of teens decide to trespass his abode for thrills and everything goes awry.Quaid and cutie Aimee Teegarden head the cast, but it's Tony Oller who shines here as the troubled protagonist. He's very reminiscent of Robby Benson.Like I said, the story is like a Scooby-Doo yarn, but realistic and without the dog. Although Quaid is over-the-top and somewhat campy as the villain the rest of the cast play it straight. I was surprised by the dramatic score and a few really touching scenes.Some complain that the subplot of a dead sister and a ghost sighting goes nowhere, but it's there for a reason, just think about it.Although there's some realistic cussing there's zero raunch.BOTTOM LINE: I was pleasantly surpised by this great little film.
