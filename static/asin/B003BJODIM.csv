It was a movie about a small town filled with unhappy people. Normally, I can find one thing good to say about a movie such as one good actor/actress. beautiful setting or wardrobe. Literally, there is nothing to recommend about this movie. The only thing I can say is, if you are having problems in your own life, maybe watching this movie will make you feel about your own.",1,One of the worst movies I have seen.,1387670400,"12 22, 2013",2013,501,"['be', 'honest', 'did', ""n't"", 'finish', 'watching', 'movie', 'made', 'about', '75', '%', 'was', 'not', 'what', 'had', 'expected', 'love', 'story', 'was', 'movie', 'small', 'town', 'filled', 'unhappy', 'people', 'Normally', 'can', 'find', 'one', 'thing', 'good', 'say', 'movie', 'such', 'one', 'good', 'actor/actress', 'beautiful', 'setting', 'wardrobe', 'Literally', 'nothing', 'recommend', 'movie', 'only', 'thing', 'can', 'say', 'are', 'having', 'problems', 'own', 'life', 'maybe', 'watching', 'movie', 'will', 'make', 'feel', 'own']",Small Town Saturday Night

There were several characters to keep track of and the author of this story did incredibly well at wrapping up all the loose ends. He also kept the story very strong all the way through. Another fun surprise in it was that not only did Chris Pine star in it but so did his father, Robert Pine. I recognized him immediately because I had watched his TV show, CHiPs, for years when I was a kid.It was also very funny at times.",4,"Strong Story line, Dramatic, and Funny",1386374400,"12 7, 2013",2013,536,"['did', 'enjoy', 'watching', 'first', 'did', ""n't"", 'like', 'story', 'line', 'became', 'more', 'interesting', 'developed', 'were', 'several', 'characters', 'keep', 'track', 'author', 'story', 'did', 'incredibly', 'well', 'wrapping', 'up', 'loose', 'ends', 'also', 'kept', 'story', 'very', 'strong', 'way', 'fun', 'surprise', 'was', 'not', 'only', 'did', 'Chris', 'Pine', 'star', 'so', 'did', 'father', 'Robert', 'Pine', 'recognized', 'immediately', 'had', 'watched', 'TV', 'show', 'CHiPs', 'years', 'when', 'was', 'kid.It', 'was', 'also', 'very', 'funny', 'times']",Small Town Saturday Night
1335805,A3IJLB3K3GV373,B003BJODIM,"D. Knox ""DVD Collector""","[2, 2]","this movie has different levels of life. first the small town life and the friends and loves involved, next the ability to find more if that is what it really is. there are some that are very happy in a small town, and that is all right. but for some it is important to find oneself and what he or she is capable of. for them it is not a happy time in a small town. it is about what each person's  priorities are. in this case Rhett (Chris Pine) has an opportunity to be more than he is in that town. I agree that if you really feel that way you have to try, even if you fail. in a sense you never really fail, you just get the answer you will need later on in life. Rhett has to give up everything to pursue what he feels is his dream. the characters are not that far from real in the portrayal of how it would probably be . granted it is a movie, and certain privileges have to be taken, but overall it is a moving story of what each of us would have to go with in that decision. this is only my opinion, and i am far from always being right. i grew up in a small town, and it is different from the &#34;larger&#34; life. it is not for everybody, as there is more of a story and very little &#34;action&#34; involved. but it is interesting.",5,how hard is it to leave one life for another,1374969600,"07 28, 2013",2013,1242,"['movie', 'different', 'levels', 'life', 'first', 'small', 'town', 'life', 'friends', 'loves', 'involved', 'ability', 'find', 'more', 'what', 'really', 'are', 'are', 'very', 'happy', 'small', 'town', 'right', 'important', 'find', 'what', 'capable', 'not', 'happy', 'time', 'small', 'town', 'what', 'person', 'priorities', 'are', 'case', 'Rhett', 'Chris', 'Pine', 'opportunity', 'be', 'more', 'town', 'agree', 'really', 'feel', 'way', 'have', 'try', 'even', 'fail', 'sense', 'never', 'really', 'fail', 'just', 'get', 'answer', 'will', 'need', 'later', 'life', 'Rhett', 'give', 'up', 'everything', 'pursue', 'what', 'dream', 'characters', 'are', 'not', 'far', 'real', 'portrayal', 'how', 'would', 'probably', 'be', 'granted', 'movie', 'certain', 'privileges', 'have', 'be', 'taken', 'overall', 'moving', 'story', 'what', 'would', 'have', 'go', 'decision', 'only', 'opinion', 'i', 'am', 'far', 'always', 'being', 'right', 'i', 'grew', 'up', 'small', 'town', 'different', '34', 'larger', '34', 'life', 'not', 'everybody', 'more', 'story', 'very', 'little', '34', 'action', '34', 'involved', 'interesting']",Small Town Saturday Night

He sings and plays music, and it should be fun.He was fantastic as Kirk -- even to a Star Trek fan since 1966, such as myself.  I've seen him play guitar in ""Blind Dating,"" a good movie which I would also recommend, especially to Pine fans -- but also in its own right.",5,Chris Pine,1271203200,"04 14, 2010",2010,382,"[""'m"", 'pre-ordering', 'one', 'reason', 'Chris', 'Pine', 'Captain', 'Kirk', 'Abrams', 'Star', 'Trek', '2009', 'movie', 'music', 'should', 'be', 'fun.He', 'was', 'fantastic', 'Kirk', 'even', 'Star', 'Trek', 'fan', '1966', 'such', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'play', 'guitar', 'Blind', 'Dating', 'good', 'movie', 'would', 'also', 'recommend', 'especially', 'Pine', 'fans', 'also', 'own', 'right']",Small Town Saturday Night

A lot going on all at once and the characters are never introduced or explained well. Bit of a sad plot, kind of a downer, but if you're looking to see Pine show his acting talent in a very different role for him and watch him play guitar, this movie is for you! ;)Thankfully this film is only 90 minutes, I don't think I could've sat through much more of it....
