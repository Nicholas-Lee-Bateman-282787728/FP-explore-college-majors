He has to sneak his pot and bong into the house but she uses the bong for a vase and cooks up the pot as tea and gets high with her friends.There were a few moments of hilarity but by the last half hour I was ready for it to be over.This movie might appeal to young teens, except there were a few extremely graphic sex scenes which would be inappropriate, not to mention the constant pot smoking.I would have rated it four stars for the first hour, due to a couple of really funny lol scenes but it went steadily downhill into boredom.  Most of the movie was shots of a video game company and employees having fun in very adolescent ways.  The rest were shots of various stoned parties.  Which doesn't sound bad, except, it was.  The last half hour was downright tedious, as grandma learns to play video games, the pot dealer gets a crazy monkey, the twenty something video game enthusiast who lives like a five year old gets it on with a seventy year old woman, etc.In short this is everything a young minded teenage boy might enjoy.

This one by Happy Madison; Adam Sandlers movie company.This movie is about a 35 game tester named Alex ( Hey, my name. ) And he goes broke and has to live around and finally with his Grandma. This is a hilarious movie with several great jokes that I would share, but it would ruin the movie...This movie ( I don't think ) was in theaters, and if it was, it didn't get very much attention; and it should have. Dante in this movie is hilarious ( the weed seller ) and really, the movie as a whole is hilarious. The only real problem with the movie who plays ""The Robot"". He continuously makes stupid buzzing sounds and has ""two sides"", one normal, and the other that he does when he is nervous. That really drags down the story to me.This is a great movie and fans of any film like Cheech and Chong's movies, Don't Me A Menace To South Central While Drinking Your Juice In The Hood, Harold and Kumar Goto White Castle... and so on.Definitely at least rent this movie.

Guy gets kicked out of his apartment since his stoner roomate spent all their rent money on hookers.  Guy is now forced to move in with his Grandma.Weak at best but it makes for an interesting idea.  It would have been more plausable if they used the idea from Failure to Launch but you can't have everything.Sure their are plenty of laughs but parts of the movie just don't work.  after all the main character is spending a lot of money on drugs , pot.  Yet the amount of money spent on drugs is never brought up.  In deed the reason the guy can not get a new apartment is because he can not aford a new apartment, yet he can afford his drug habit.To complicate matters our hero is a video game tester.  Supposedly one of the best and oldest in the business.  But he does not come across as a gamer.  When he gives hints on past games or is descring one our hero sounds fake and passionateless.Instead of believing him you feel that he is mocking the sub culture that he is suposed to be a part of.Even with this the movie does shine.  This is done by one hell of a supporting cast.  From the Grandma bunch to the Geek crew you have a wonderful mix of pranksters and vetrans.

The movie tried to pull off comedy, but most of the time it was just lame jokes and gags that weren't really memorable.  It was almost like a party comedy.  A bunch of young work friends throw parties, get drunk and laugh together.  This doesn't amount to much, in the end.  It's a trick to make up for weak writing.One of the worst things about the movie was that one annoying guy who worked with the other video game testers.  He apparently had problems ""upstairs"" and had a split personality.  Throughout the movie he kept talking to himself and answering his own questions in another voice.  I didn't care for this character.There were also a few unnecessary sex jokes, such as the one guy spending the night at a friends house and decided he felt like ""doing his thing"" beside the toilet in the bathroom, only for his friends mom to walk in and for him to turn around and... you can finish this sentence.  Not to mention that one party scene where one of the friends couldn't remove his face from a hot womans breasts.  This isn't very funny.The old ladies that the one video game tester moved in with (one of them being his grandmother) were the only characters that supplied any kind of humor.  The one scene of the grandmother scaring his grandson by pretending to be a ghost under a bed was hysterical.However, at the end of the film when that annoying guy I mention above has a video game competition with the grandmother, the writers made almost no effort whatsoever to make it exciting.  This was a very disappointing scene and it was supposed to be the part that finished off the main storyline, which means, it *should* have been memorable.If the movie focused more on the grandmother and her friends, and less on the video game employee friends, it would have been funnier.

Johns ""Belgragahd""","[1, 3]","This movie is along the same lines as classic pot-smoking movies such as....(marajuana kills short term memory)....uh well who cares about names anyway. Gramma's Boy is a movie for the ages. When I say movie for the ages I don't mean that it will stand the test of time or give Shakespear a run for his money. What I mean is many uneducated men and women are returniong home in thier 20's and 30's and living with thier parents. That is one of the reasons I enjoyed this movie. I am 29 and have lived at home for about 2 years now. Some of you might laugh at the thought of moving back in with a parental unit. That is exactly why you should see this movie. It's about a video game playtester who's roomate spent the rent money on hookers. Rather than be homeless or live with his friends, whom all seem to live with thier parents also, he moves in with Gramma. Not only does this guy smoke pot, he has one of the most bizzare drug dealers in the history of drug dealers. As seen in the scene when his dealer gets a lion to protect his stash. If you like video games or illicit substances, you'll love this movie. If you like both you'll absolutely love this movie! Gramma's Boy weirdly doubles as a date movie. So if you and your girl chief together, watch it while you do. For all you non-smokers/non-videogammers, steer clear of this one.

Alex's best friend at the company lives with his parents has never had a girlfriend and still wears pajamas with booties. The head game designer is a nutcase that dresses in a trench coat and bounces between a robotic style voice and his normal one.When Alex is evicted from his apartment he ends up moving in with his grandmother, a nice woman with two female roommates her age. Rather than tell his workmates the truth, Alex tells them that he is living with three ""hot babes"" that cannot keep their hands off of him. That is only the first of the bizarre twists in this movie where there is never a connection.A lot of weed is smoked, Alex's friend ends up in bed with the grey-haired Shirley Jones and Kevin Nealon is the owner of the company, a man espousing Eastern philosophy in a really bad and obnoxious manner. The jokes are often more uninspired than stupid, especially when they involve the various types of intoxicants that are introduced.Billed as hilarious, this film is anything but that, it is dull, dull, dull, with the jokes basically falling into two tracks: socially incompetent white guy techno-nerds and the mind-altering effects of smoking various kinds of dope.

642970,A2H6IM0K9931E,B00005JOSO,"ElvisCostellosWeiner ""Chekhov Is The Greatest""","[3, 44]","This movie could have used Adam Sandler.This is a big statement coming from me. Sandler seems like a nice guy, but his movies, with the exception of a few, have steadfastedly refused to amuse me. Happy Gilmore is his absolute peak: funny situations, good jokes, good comedic actors working together to be funny. Sandler is at his best, throwing out one-liners and hilarious jokes that absolutely refuse to become unfunny. It's his high point as a comedian. Besides certain points of Billy Madison and parts of The Wedding Singer, he's worthless. Everything else has been either stupid (Little Nicky, or whatever that movie was called, The Waterboy) or sappy (Big Daddy, 50 First Dates). He's funny if he has good material, but he rarely ever gets it.Why is it so important that I write this long thesis on Adam Sandler? I want to illustrate to the reader of this review how momentous of an occasion it is when I say the following: THIS MOVIE NEEDED ADAM SANDLER.Made by the same production company or whatever that has made his last several movies, it differs in his last few movies in that he plays no role in this movie. And this hurts. Fans of his movies will recognize most of the cast: many of them have been in his movies for a long time. The supporting cast, basically. It's almost like Adam said ""you know what guys, you've been such a good supporting cast in my career, how about you make a movie where YOU'RE THE STARS? I'll sit this one out.""This movie makes me realize how much I've underestimated Sandler as a comedian. I always thought he was stupid, crude, and much too blunt. However, I was proven wrong. Sandler is absolutely subtle and complex when compared to this crap. This is seriously the worst comedy I've ever seen. It is the epitome of bad comedy writing. I counted 3 things in the movie that made me smile, but then frown when they were undeveloped. I'm sorry if I can't remember any of them: they're all drowned in the sea of crap that is the rest of the movie. This was a poorly plotted, poorly paced, poorly acted, and poorly written movie. There is no plot until the very end: an hour and a half is spent on character development. The movie is almost over when the main character reveals he was once an accountant. What?! He just opines this at the very end to his boss, and it changes absolutely nothing in the movie. The characters are all painfully shallow caricatures. This makes the ""climax"" of the movie completely unimpressive: the entirely unfunny character of the main bad guy (can't remember his name, ain't trying to find out) steals the lead characters game, claiming it as his own. Finally, drama. It's resolved in five minutes: grandma comes in, plays the game, bam, that's it end of movie. The hour and a half before this is spent wallowing in ridiculousness. He lives with his grandma: they watch the Antique Show, and he can't beta test his game. GET IT?! He comes home late, gets high, and cooks some food. He removes the tray from the oven without gloves, badly burning his hands, being unable to beta test his game. GET IT?! (I don't get how this is supposed to be his grandma's fault, but whatever.) His grandma finds some ""tea"" in his pot stash, and drinks it with her friends. They get high. GET IT?! Doris Roberts tries really hard to make her grandma role amusing, but really this is just Everybody Loves Raymond without jokes. At least Everybody Loves Raymond has real jokes, written by a real comedian. Sure, they're often lame and unfunny, but hey, I've laughed at that show. I didn't laugh once in this movie.This movie is everything that's wrong with comedy now. I can't even express it adaquetly in words how much this movie offended me. Even with Adam Sandler this movie would have sucked: the jokes are simply not there.

Kevin Nealon does a small role similar to his zen golfer in Happy Gilmore, David Spade cameos as a gay waiter in a vegan restaurant and Rob Schneider has a scene as the landlord who throws the main character out.  You'll recognize plenty of other Happy Madison alum through out.In the extras, brief vignettes about the ""bathroom scene"" and the monkey are funny and appropriately short.  I also watched the deleted scenes, which had a few laughs. I didn't check out any other extras, but enjoyed those.I won't buy this movie, but I will definitely watch it if it's on HBO, and I'll recommend it to my friends who aren't easily offended.",3,"I won't buy it, but I'll watch it again",1147046400,"05 8, 2006",2006,1253,"['was', 'silly', 'stoner', 'movie', 'several', 'hysterical', 'scenes', 'enough', 'good', 'laughs', 'do', ""n't"", 'regret', 'seeing', 'Hearing', 'reviews', 'expected', 'be', 'much', 'worse', 'Almost', 'lovingly', 'mocking', 'geek', 'culture', 'movie', 'will', 'probably', 'be', 'best', 'enjoyed', 'geeks', 'stoners', 'people', 'who', 'do', ""n't"", 'mind', 'humor', 'designed', 'them.If', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'other', 'Happy', 'Madison', 'productions', 'know', 'what', 'expect', 'sex', 'jokes', 'drunk/high', 'escapades', 'lots', 'lots', 'swearing', 'plot', 'thin', 'really', 'not', 'point', 'villian', 'super-nerd', 'one', 'so', 'geeky', 'even', 'software', 'testers', 'make', 'fun', 'back', 'Kevin', 'Nealon', 'small', 'role', 'similar', 'zen', 'golfer', 'Happy', 'Gilmore', 'David', 'Spade', 'cameos', 'gay', 'waiter', 'vegan', 'restaurant', 'Rob', 'Schneider', 'scene', 'landlord', 'who', 'main', 'character', 'out', ""'ll"", 'recognize', 'plenty', 'other', 'Happy', 'Madison', 'alum', 'extras', 'brief', 'vignettes', 'bathroom', 'scene', 'monkey', 'are', 'funny', 'appropriately', 'short', 'also', 'watched', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'had', 'few', 'laughs', 'did', ""n't"", 'check', 'out', 'other', 'extras', 'enjoyed', 'those.I', 'wo', ""n't"", 'buy', 'movie', 'will', 'definitely', 'watch', 'HBO', ""'ll"", 'recommend', 'friends', 'who', 'are', ""n't"", 'easily', 'offended']",Grandma's Boy

Comedic timing, a brief romantic angle, wonderfully silly acting and a fun plot make this one of the most perfect comedies I've ever seen. Allen Covert plays Alex, a recently homeless video game tester who's just looking for a break.  He visits his local weed dealer, played tightly by Peter Dante, to see if he can stay at his house for awhile.  Alex has second thoughts about staying there when he finds out that Dante's African tribesman buddy, Dr. Shokalu, has acquired an actual lion to protect the stash.  His next attempt at bedding down is with his game-testing buddy, played with stereotypical geek charm by Nick Swardson.  His sleepover experience at Swardson's home reveals that Swardson still lives with his parents, has a lot of toys, and a really cool car bed.  It also leads up to the first really funny (and really wrong) confrontation involving Covert and one of Swardson's family members.  From there, Covert ends up staying with his grandma, Doris Roberts, who is basically playing a role similar to that of hers in ""Everybody Loves Raymond,"" but with a whole lot more edge.  She and her two roommates, Shirley Knight and Shirley Jones (Partridge Family), welcome Covert into their home with open arms.  The result is an all out pot party, geriatric sex, geeks fulfilling their wildest dreams, a kung-fu chimp, dance dance revolution challenges, vegetarian humor, a game programming scandal and a ton of other things that just don't belong together but somehow work here.There is also a romantic angle to the story involving the cute Linda Cardellini (Freaks and Geeks, the Scooby movies).  ""Grandma's Boy"" takes care to not drag the comedy down with the love story as I've seen in countless other comedies these days.  Cardellini plays Covert's new supervisor, and they become close friends as the story rolls along.  Even she manages to become part of the lunacy when she takes the boys out one evening.A number of SNL alumni are in this flick.  Rob Schneider makes a brief appearance as Covert's landlord.  Kevin Nealon plays the holistic owner of the game company Covert works for.  The scene stealer, however, is David Spade as Shiloh, a sexually-questionable waiter at a vegetarian restuarant who takes on Covert and his buddies while they're celebrating the completion of game-testing.  The only SNL omission is Adam Sandler, who's Happy Madison company produced this flick.  However, it's obvious that he put his stamp on this movie.  It features the same stable of actors that are featured in almost every other Sandler flick out there.This movie is wrong in so many ways, but that's what makes it fun.  The really amazing thing is that all of it is pulled off with little or no actual offense to those who are made fun of, and that's an amazing feat these days.  If you love dirty comedies like ""The 40 year-old Virgin,"" ""There's Something About Mary,"" and ""Wedding Crashers,"" you're sure to love this flick.Very highly recommended.

Such is the case with ""Grandma's Boy"".""Grandma's Boy"" stars Allen Covert in the title role.  You may recognize him from many of Adam Sandler's films, notably ""The Wedding Singer"", where he plays Sammy, the friend who wears the Michael Jackson-esque outfits and drives a limousine.Anyway, ""Grandma's Boy"" is the story of man-child Alex, a 35 year old with a career as a video game tester.  Hijinks ensue when Alex is forced to move in with his loving grandmother, Lilly, (Doris Roberts of ""Everybody Loves Raymond"" fame), and her two roommates.  Grace, (Shirley Jones), has the libido of a 20 year old and Bea, (Shirley Knight), is overmedicated to the point of bringing Terret's Syndrome-type humor to the mix.Alex, of course, does not want to admit that he lives with his grandmother, so he tells all of his friends/co-workers, including his sexy new boss, (Linda Cardellini), that ""three hot babes"" live with him.  But soon enough, the secret is revealed and the real fun begins.The real dilemma is presented though when a rival co-worker, J.P., (Joel Moore), with some serious identity issues is working against Alex to try and present a new and impressive video game idea that will increase his ego and make everyone else look like crap, as always.  But this year, Alex has a new plan up his sleeve that might make J.P. back down once and for all and look like the psycho he...well...already looks like...but worse!If you like stoner humor, karate-chopping chimps, men who talk like robots, pop culture references, drunken karaoke, unfortunate incidents with Lara Croft dolls and enough sexual innuendo to make the world go 'round, then you'll love ""Grandma's Boy"".  Also starring Jonah Hill, Kevin Nealon, Nick Swardson, David Spade and Rob Schneider.  You might recognize these people from their following credits:Jonah Hill--has appeared in such films as ""Knocked Up"" and ""Superbad""--a member of Judd Apatow's brat-pack.Joel Moore--he has been in everything lately from ""Dodgeball"" to Katy Perry's music video for ""Waking Up in Vegas"".Nick Swardson--a popular stand-up comedian with specials on Comedy Central.Kevin Nealon--SNL alum.  Also briefly appeared in ""The Wedding Singer"" as the banker Adam Sandler goes to for a loan.David Spade--another SNL alum.  You'd probably know him from the TV show, ""Just Shoot Me"" or the films ""Joe Dirt"", ""Black Sheep"" and ""Tommy Boy"".Rob Schneider--yet another SNL alum who has been in most of Sandler's body of work, except for a few films he branched out on his own with, including ""Deuce Bigalow: Male Gigolo"" and ""The Hot Chick"".",3,Enjoyable stoner flick...,1255392000,"10 13, 2009",2009,2666,"['movie', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'like', 'movie', 'recommend', 'friends', 'Such', 'case', 'Grandma', 'Boy', 'Grandma', 'Boy', 'Allen', 'Covert', 'title', 'role', 'may', 'recognize', 'many', 'Adam', 'Sandler', 'films', 'notably', 'Wedding', 'Singer', 'where', 'Sammy', 'friend', 'who', 'Michael', 'Jackson-esque', 'outfits', 'limousine.Anyway', 'Grandma', 'Boy', 'story', 'man-child', 'Alex', '35', 'year', 'old', 'career', 'video', 'game', 'tester', 'Hijinks', 'ensue', 'when', 'Alex', 'forced', 'move', 'loving', 'grandmother', 'Lilly', 'Doris', 'Roberts', 'Everybody', 'Raymond', 'fame', 'two', 'roommates', 'Grace', 'Shirley', 'Jones', 'libido', '20', 'year', 'old', 'Bea', 'Shirley', 'Knight', 'overmedicated', 'point', 'bringing', 'Terret', 'Syndrome-type', 'humor', 'mix.Alex', 'course', 'not', 'want', 'admit', 'grandmother', 'friends/co-workers', 'including', 'sexy', 'new', 'boss', 'Linda', 'Cardellini', 'three', 'hot', 'babes', 'live', 'soon', 'enough', 'secret', 'revealed', 'real', 'fun', 'begins.The', 'real', 'dilemma', 'presented', 'when', 'rival', 'co-worker', 'J.P.', 'Joel', 'Moore', 'serious', 'identity', 'issues', 'working', 'Alex', 'try', 'present', 'new', 'impressive', 'video', 'game', 'idea', 'will', 'increase', 'ego', 'make', 'everyone', 'else', 'look', 'crap', 'always', 'year', 'Alex', 'new', 'plan', 'sleeve', 'might', 'make', 'J.P.', 'back', 'down', 'once', 'look', 'psycho', 'well', 'already', 'worse', 'like', 'stoner', 'humor', 'karate-chopping', 'chimps', 'men', 'who', 'talk', 'robots', 'pop', 'culture', 'references', 'drunken', 'karaoke', 'unfortunate', 'incidents', 'Lara', 'Croft', 'dolls', 'enough', 'sexual', 'innuendo', 'make', 'world', 'go', ""'round"", 'then', ""'ll"", 'love', 'Grandma', 'Boy', 'Also', 'starring', 'Jonah', 'Hill', 'Kevin', 'Nealon', 'Nick', 'Swardson', 'David', 'Spade', 'Rob', 'Schneider', 'might', 'recognize', 'people', 'following', 'credits', 'Jonah', 'Hill', 'appeared', 'such', 'films', 'Knocked', 'Up', 'Superbad', 'member', 'Judd', 'Apatow', 'brat-pack.Joel', 'Moore', 'been', 'everything', 'lately', 'Dodgeball', 'Katy', 'Perry', 'music', 'video', 'Waking', 'Up', 'Vegas', '.Nick', 'Swardson', 'popular', 'stand-up', 'comedian', 'specials', 'Comedy', 'Central.Kevin', 'Nealon', 'SNL', 'alum', 'Also', 'briefly', 'appeared', 'Wedding', 'Singer', 'banker', 'Adam', 'Sandler', 'loan.David', 'Spade', 'SNL', 'alum', ""'d"", 'probably', 'know', 'TV', 'show', 'Just', 'Shoot', 'Me', 'films', 'Joe', 'Dirt', 'Black', 'Sheep', 'Tommy', 'Boy', '.Rob', 'Schneider', 'yet', 'SNL', 'alum', 'who', 'been', 'most', 'Sandler', 'body', 'work', 'few', 'films', 'branched', 'out', 'own', 'including', 'Deuce', 'Bigalow', 'Male', 'Gigolo', 'Hot', 'Chick']",Grandma's Boy

The movie definitely has a familiar Sandler-type feeling to it, but I thought it worked well with the given cast.It all starts out with a hilarious scene where Alex (Covert) is being evicted from his place while playing video games. It turns out his roommate has acquired a penchant for Filipino hookers and he's spent all the rent money on his addiction. It sounds pretty weak, but it's a great scene and it's really well done.A good number of actors make guest appearances. Rob Schneider is the Middle-Eastern landlord, David Spade is a feminine waiter at a health food restaurant, Kevin Nealon is an overly spiritual boss, the kid from Dodgeball (Joel Moore) plays a video game designing genius who has a robot as part of his dual personality, the mother from Everybody Loves Raymond plays Alex's grandmother... Nick Swardson (who is a professional stand-up comic) is hilarious in his role as Alex's best friend at work. He really adds to the movie with his personality and one-liner delivery.There are some really good lines in this movie, as well as some strikingly funny scenes. I found myself laughing out loud more than a few times. If you liked early Sandler movies, you will definitely appreciate this kind of humor.

After attending a family function, his grandmother (played by Doris Roberts) invites him to stay with her and her roommates: the sexually provocative Grace (Shirley Jones) and the over-medicated Bea (Shirley Knight).  Alex works at Brainasium, where he acts as a mentor and hero for his subordinates (who include Nick Swardson as Jeff and Jonah Hill as Barry), a go-to-guy and possible love interest for his superior Samantha (Linda Cardellini), and as an antagonist to video game designer J.P. (Joel David Moore).  How will everyone react when they find out he lives with his grandmother?Peter Dante appears as Dante the Cannabis supplier while Kevin Nealon appears as Mr. Cheezle, the nu-age hippie head of Brainasium.Now, anyone who's checking this movie out to see an Oscar-worthy performance is looking for the wrong film.  This movie is chock full of crude humor and utterly ridiculous moments.  The film doesn't pay much attention to particular details as it just has a general story for the viewer to follow.  That may have had something to do with why it wasn't a critical success.However, once it went to DVD, people started to realize just how funny the film really is.  There's so many great comedic scenarios that when I saw the movie for the first time, I was laughing hard at the nonsense these guys got themselves into.  This has been the first comedy movie in a while that's gotten that reaction out of me.  There's so many one-liners in the film that after my buddies and I saw it, we had plenty of in-jokes with each other that were related to the film.I purchased it on DVD and considering the price Amazon is currently selling it for ($9.49 as of this post), I really can't think of a reason not to get it.  Highly recommended for the 18-25 crowd that likes to party and for the 26-40something-and-beyond crowd that still knows how to have a good time.",4,A Great Hangout Movie!,1240012800,"04 18, 2009",2009,2067,"['Synopsis', 'Alex', 'played', 'Allen', 'Covert', 'cannabis-loving', 'video', 'game', 'tester', 'mid-30s', 'who', 'unexpectedly', 'homeless', 'roommate', 'spent', 'rent', 'money', 'prostitutes', 'attending', 'family', 'function', 'grandmother', 'played', 'Doris', 'Roberts', 'stay', 'roommates', 'sexually', 'provocative', 'Grace', 'Shirley', 'Jones', 'over-medicated', 'Bea', 'Shirley', 'Knight', 'Alex', 'Brainasium', 'where', 'mentor', 'hero', 'subordinates', 'who', 'include', 'Nick', 'Swardson', 'Jeff', 'Jonah', 'Hill', 'Barry', 'go-to-guy', 'possible', 'love', 'interest', 'superior', 'Samantha', 'Linda', 'Cardellini', 'antagonist', 'video', 'game', 'designer', 'J.P.', 'Joel', 'David', 'Moore', 'How', 'will', 'everyone', 'react', 'when', 'find', 'out', 'grandmother', 'Peter', 'Dante', 'Dante', 'Cannabis', 'supplier', 'Kevin', 'Nealon', 'Mr.', 'Cheezle', 'nu-age', 'hippie', 'head', 'Brainasium.Now', 'anyone', 'who', 'checking', 'movie', 'see', 'Oscar-worthy', 'performance', 'looking', 'wrong', 'film', 'movie', 'chock', 'full', 'crude', 'humor', 'utterly', 'ridiculous', 'moments', 'film', ""n't"", 'pay', 'much', 'attention', 'particular', 'details', 'just', 'general', 'story', 'viewer', 'follow', 'may', 'have', 'had', 'something', 'do', 'why', 'was', ""n't"", 'critical', 'success.However', 'once', 'went', 'DVD', 'people', 'started', 'realize', 'just', 'how', 'funny', 'film', 'really', 'so', 'many', 'great', 'comedic', 'scenarios', 'when', 'saw', 'movie', 'first', 'time', 'was', 'laughing', 'hard', 'nonsense', 'guys', 'got', 'been', 'first', 'comedy', 'movie', 'while', 'gotten', 'reaction', 'so', 'many', 'one-liners', 'film', 'buddies', 'saw', 'had', 'plenty', 'in-jokes', 'other', 'were', 'related', 'film.I', 'purchased', 'DVD', 'considering', 'price', 'Amazon', 'currently', 'selling', '9.49', 'post', 'really', 'ca', ""n't"", 'think', 'reason', 'not', 'get', 'Highly', 'recommended', '18-25', 'crowd', 'party', '26-40something-and-beyond', 'crowd', 'still', 'how', 'have', 'good', 'time']",Grandma's Boy
643006,AGCJDJH2CTDD9,B00005JOSO,Mike Zimmerman,"[2, 6]","At 35 years old, Alex (Allen Covert) tests video games for Brainasium, the company behind the wildly popular game ""Eternal Death Slayer"". When he discovers his roommate Josh (Jonathan Loughran) hasn't paid the rent for the last six months because he used the money on Filipino hookers, he finds himself going from place to place to find his ideal crashing ground. But the last place he'd wind up staying would be with his Grandma Lily (Doris Roberts), the only one who gives him a place to stay in exchange for doing chores around the house. Lily shares her home with two friends, Bea (Shirley Knight) and Grace (Shirley Jones), who keep Alex busy nearly every night. As soon as Alex's co-workers find out, they don't know the real story. Meanwhile, Alex is trying to charm Brainasium's beautiful new executive Samantha (Linda Cardellini) while dealing with the firm's space-case CEO Cheezle (Kevil Nealon) and J.P. (Joel David Moore), a teenage game designer who dresses up like Neo from ""The Matrix"" and speaks often with a robot tone.If there's one thing I learned from Adam Sandler, it's that the movies he produces and doesn't star in don't turn out to be as good as HIS movies. Stinkers like ""Joe Dirt"" and the last ""Deuce Bigalow"" (look for a reference in this movie) come to mind. As far as I'm concerned, his latest effort from the Happy Madison camp, ""Grandma's Boy,"" has a few redeeming parts. But with a better director (Frank Coraci or Peter Segal), this could've been a laugh-a-minute rival to last summer's gross-out comedies.But inside all this craziness, there's some good things to lampoon. One of them is the video game industry, where many of the guys play video games like ""Dance Dance Revolution"" (watch this movie for the scene alone) or whatever. However, director Nicholaus Goossen (Allen Covert's assistant on ""Eight Crazy Nights"") sadly shifts the action away to some unfunny points, like Alex pleasuring himself to a Lara Croft doll or anytime Joel David Moore is on screen (the robot voice isn't really that clever to begin with). And Adam Sandler should know better, after producing good movies like the most recent remake of ""The Longest Yard.""There are some good actors in this movie who are game. Shifted into focus for the first time, Covert somehow seems bored out of his mind when delivering several of his lines and, as I said before, Moore is a one-note joke. But Sandler finds his niche with his other co-stars, such as Nick Swardson (a stand-up comic from Comedy Central) as Alex's often buddy. And Linda Cardellini scores when she drunkenly performs Salt-N-Pepa's ""Push It"" - she's easily above this juvenile material, along with senior actresses Doris Roberts (still funny even after ""Everybody Loves Raymond""), and Shirleys Knight and Jones. Sadly, cameos from David Spade (as a fruity waiter) and Rob Schneider (as Alex's tenant) are wasted.But there are hosts of other good performances. Loughran could've used more screen time, as with what he's got to work with, he could've easily taken this show to new heights. And leave it to Peter Dante to chew up the scenery whenever he mentions about different types of weed. If only Peter Segal directed this movie, the jokes could've taken off, because Goossen doesn't have the imagination and handling of comic timing for this to happen.But, regardless, this still is a funny movie.",3,"""That is pure ****ing insanity.""",1164412800,"11 25, 2006",2006,3373,"['35', 'years', 'old', 'Alex', 'Allen', 'Covert', 'video', 'games', 'Brainasium', 'company', 'wildly', 'popular', 'game', 'Eternal', 'Death', 'Slayer', 'When', 'roommate', 'Josh', 'Jonathan', 'Loughran', ""n't"", 'paid', 'rent', 'last', 'six', 'months', 'used', 'money', 'Filipino', 'hookers', 'going', 'place', 'place', 'find', 'ideal', 'crashing', 'ground', 'last', 'place', ""'d"", 'wind', 'up', 'staying', 'would', 'be', 'Grandma', 'Lily', 'Doris', 'Roberts', 'only', 'one', 'who', 'place', 'stay', 'exchange', 'doing', 'chores', 'house', 'Lily', 'shares', 'home', 'two', 'friends', 'Bea', 'Shirley', 'Knight', 'Grace', 'Shirley', 'Jones', 'who', 'keep', 'Alex', 'busy', 'nearly', 'night', 'As', 'soon', 'Alex', 'co-workers', 'find', 'out', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'real', 'story', 'Meanwhile', 'Alex', 'trying', 'charm', 'Brainasium', 'beautiful', 'new', 'executive', 'Samantha', 'Linda', 'Cardellini', 'dealing', 'firm', 'space-case', 'CEO', 'Cheezle', 'Kevil', 'Nealon', 'J.P.', 'Joel', 'David', 'Moore', 'teenage', 'game', 'designer', 'who', 'up', 'Neo', 'Matrix', 'speaks', 'often', 'robot', 'tone.If', 'one', 'thing', 'learned', 'Adam', 'Sandler', 'movies', ""n't"", 'star', 'do', ""n't"", 'turn', 'out', 'be', 'as', 'good', 'HIS', 'movies', 'Stinkers', 'Joe', 'Dirt', 'last', 'Deuce', 'Bigalow', 'look', 'reference', 'movie', 'come', 'mind', 'As', 'far', ""'m"", 'concerned', 'latest', 'effort', 'Happy', 'Madison', 'camp', 'Grandma', 'Boy', 'few', 'redeeming', 'parts', 'better', 'director', 'Frank', 'Coraci', 'Peter', 'Segal', 'could', ""'ve"", 'been', 'laugh-a-minute', 'rival', 'last', 'summer', 'gross-out', 'comedies.But', 'craziness', 'good', 'things', 'lampoon', 'One', 'video', 'game', 'industry', 'where', 'many', 'guys', 'play', 'video', 'games', 'Dance', 'Dance', 'Revolution', 'watch', 'movie', 'scene', 'alone', 'However', 'director', 'Nicholaus', 'Goossen', 'Allen', 'Covert', 'assistant', 'Eight', 'Crazy', 'Nights', 'sadly', 'shifts', 'action', 'away', 'unfunny', 'points', 'Alex', 'pleasuring', 'Lara', 'Croft', 'doll', 'anytime', 'Joel', 'David', 'Moore', 'screen', 'robot', 'voice', ""n't"", 'really', 'that', 'clever', 'begin', 'Adam', 'Sandler', 'should', 'know', 'better', 'producing', 'good', 'movies', 'most', 'recent', 'remake', 'Longest', 'Yard', 'are', 'good', 'actors', 'movie', 'who', 'are', 'game', 'Shifted', 'focus', 'first', 'time', 'Covert', 'somehow', 'bored', 'mind', 'when', 'delivering', 'several', 'lines', 'said', 'Moore', 'one-note', 'joke', 'Sandler', 'niche', 'other', 'co-stars', 'such', 'Nick', 'Swardson', 'stand-up', 'comic', 'Comedy', 'Central', 'Alex', 'often', 'buddy', 'Linda', 'Cardellini', 'when', 'drunkenly', 'Salt-N-Pepa', 'Push', 'easily', 'juvenile', 'material', 'senior', 'actresses', 'Doris', 'Roberts', 'still', 'funny', 'even', 'Everybody', 'Raymond', 'Shirleys', 'Knight', 'Jones', 'Sadly', 'cameos', 'David', 'Spade', 'fruity', 'waiter', 'Rob', 'Schneider', 'Alex', 'tenant', 'are', 'wasted.But', 'are', 'hosts', 'other', 'good', 'performances', 'Loughran', 'could', ""'ve"", 'used', 'more', 'screen', 'time', 'what', 'got', 'work', 'could', ""'ve"", 'easily', 'taken', 'show', 'new', 'heights', 'leave', 'Peter', 'Dante', 'chew', 'up', 'scenery', 'whenever', 'different', 'types', 'weed', 'only', 'Peter', 'Segal', 'directed', 'movie', 'jokes', 'could', ""'ve"", 'taken', 'off', 'Goossen', ""n't"", 'have', 'imagination', 'handling', 'comic', 'timing', 'happen.But', 'regardless', 'still', 'funny', 'movie']",Grandma's Boy

643011,A2UQIIJ2CD8REE,B00005JOSO,Monty Moonlight,"[2, 4]","""Grandma's Boy"" is all about Alex, a 35-year-old video game tester who finds himself needing a temporary place to stay when he is suddenly evicted due to a problem with his roommate and overdue rent. Alex tries to stay with friends, but this doesn't work out, and he soon finds himself moving in with his doting grandmother and her two friends, highly medicated Bea and bitter, promiscuous Grace. Balancing the world of his co-workers/friends (mostly twenty-something stoner gamers) and the much tamer, though just as strange world of his grandmother and her roommates is difficult for Alex at first, but he eventually finds they are able to mesh rather well. A little too well sometimes. Things aren't all wine and roses though, as one excluded co-worker with a massive ego and bizarre behavior has his sights set on the same upper-level beauty as Alex.From the folks at Happy Madison (full of those Happy Madison familiar faces), the 2006 comedy ""Grandma's Boy"" is a hilarious (if constantly crude) comedy from start to finish. Yes, there is a lot of stoner humor in this film, but you don't have to be a stoner to enjoy it. At its heart is a story about a guy a lot of gen-Xers and post-gens can relate to quite well, just trying to find his place in a much more complicated world than ever before without settling for less than what he's passionate about. It's partly a romance, like most good movies, but for the most part, it's all about laughs and telling a great story that actually feels quite original in its simplicity. A lot of it just feels like you're hanging out with friends and having a great time! The cast is superb, with Happy Madison regular Allen Covert taking the lead for a change, supported by the outrageously funny Nick Swardson and Peter Dante, and even Jonah Hill in one of his first movie roles. Linda Cardellini is the girl of Alex's dreams, Samantha, brought in to make sure the newest video game is finished on time, and she is a perfect fit. And Doris Roberts stars as Grandma Lilly, who is the perfect loving grandma. Her two friends are played by Shirley Knight and Shirley Jones, and yes, Shirley Jones is a freak in this. Watching her get nasty these days is like watching Carrie Fisher in ""Fanboys"". You wonder, would you still make out with her? I mean, if I think about Shirley in ""Oklahoma"" hard enough, I just might. Man, she was an angel in that movie. Anywho, she's no angel here, but she is incredibly funny! Bottom line, ""Grandma's Boy"" is perfect if you're looking for a relaxing comedy to just laugh out loud at, and this movie has everything. Even a monkey! The way it's been heralded as a fantastic ""stoner flick"" is kind of underestimating it, in my opinion. I'd just say it's a fantastic comedy for gen-X and younger (adults only, of course), sort of like a Kevin Smith comedy, like ""Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back"", but more Happy Madison-ish, if that makes sense. Oh, and did I forget to mention Joel Moore as the villainous weirdo, J.P.? That guy is a riot in this flick! Do yourself a favor and check this underrated (now a cult favorite) film out! It really annoys me how some real gems like this one and ""Hot Rod"" go unnoticed in theaters and not quite as funny flicks like ""Superbad"" and ""The Hangover"" get so much praise. Though, I have to admit, I think Grandma's Boy and Hot Rod got a lot less promotion, as I recall. I always thought it went direct to video.The DVD for ""Grandma's Boy"" is widescreen with the option of an unrated version, and it's well stocked with bonus features too! You get a director commentary AND a three-actor commentary (always enjoy group actor commentaries!), plus lots of deleted and alternate stuff, a music video, behind the scenes material (even on the music video), and, of course, the film's trailer. It really is a fantastic buy that I highly recommend!",5,Genuinely Funny!

Durham ""Big Evil""","[42, 45]","I'm usually leary of anything bearing Adam Sandler's Happy Madison production label, but much to my surprise, Grandma's Boy is a blast.  Allen Covert (who also co-wrote and produced) stars as a 35 year old video game tester working on a hit new game, and in his spare time he is secretly designing his own game while smoking a lot of marijuana.  When he gets kicked out of his house, he ends up living with his grandmother (Doris Roberts) and her two room mates (Shirley Knight and Shirley Jones) while dealing with his best friend (Nick Swardson), his ultra tan dealer (Peter Dante), his super hot new boss (the ultra hot Linda Cardellini), and some other weirdos as well.  Despite it's predictable plot and gags, Grandma's Boy works mainly because of it's stars and the blast they're having filming it.  Covert, Swardson, and Dante (all of which had a hand in either writing or producing the film) are quite funny in their roles, with Swardson stealing the show as a granny loving master of Dance Dance Revolution that still lives with his parents and sleeps in a race car bed.  Frequently funny and enjoyable throughout, Grandma's Boy is a surprising stoner comedy that is better than one might think, and it's certainly better than anything that Adam Sandler himself has headlined in the past few years.

A 30-something stoner who tests video games for a living isn't either, especially when he's lazy, rude and raunchy. The premise that such an individual might also develop a rockin' video game in his free time is a stretch, but that's the thin plot of the movie. People just don't get all creative and inspired to work on programming code while they're stoned. Trust me.The crude humor was a little too over the top. I don't really want to see a fat kid sucking on a stripper's giant silicone implants repeatedly.Some of the characters managed to be funny some of the time. Being an ultra-nerd can have humorous moments. I wanted to like the game development team at Brainium, the made up software company featured in the movie. This movie could have been so much better though. Fart scenes, raunchy sex and stoners have been overplayed in Hollywood and all these guys were too predictable.One scene that did make me laugh out loud was the ""dance"" competition with Dance, Dance, Revolution.

I'm talking about Allen Covert and Peter Dante who played the reckless and faithfull satanic heshins - they stole every scene they were in. When I saw the trailer for Grandmas Boy I was like awesome! A whole movie with these two. Sadly, though Dante isn't in it as much as the trailer made it out but that's my only quibble. But when he is on screen he's F***in hilarious. The movie stars Allen Covert as a videogame programmer who's just been evicted from his house. He initially trys to stay with his buddy played by the hilarious and quick-witted Nick Swardsen. But must leave due to getting caught masterbating by Swardsen's roomate. This scene is one of the funniest bits I've ever seen in a comedy, lately. It really pushes the boundaries of decency and thank god. It's hard to top this bit but the movie stays consistent in deliverying the funny. In a last ditch effort Covert must room with his grandma. From this point on you get copius amounts of weed smokin, sex with the elderly, depictions of pill-addled and blissed out senior citizens, a pot smoking African Chief, gratutious breast sucking, a monkey trained in karate; who can also drive and the hottest and uncomfortable striptease by televisions ER star Linda Cardellini.

He swore it would cheer me up, and not only did it do just that, but I never expected to laugh so hard. An Adam Sandler production (though he himself does not appear in the movie, everyone else you've grown to love from all the Sandler movies is here in good form), Grandma's Boy was so funny that I actually laughed so hard I began to cry. It does have moments of predictability in it, but hey, this is one of those kick-back and watch something funny movies. It's about a guy named Alex who's roommate has been spending their rent at a local ""massage"" parlor, unknown to Alex until the landlord (Rob Schneider, hilariously) evicts them for not paying rent. Alex has nowhere to go, and of course, this is where everything starts to get increasingly amusing. He winds up having to take his grandmother up on her offer to live with her and her 2 roommates. The grandmother is played by the woman who plays Raymond's mom on ""Everyone Loves Raymond"" (forgive me, I can't think of her name) and although I despise that show, she was absolutely fantastic in this. Along with having to live with his grandmother, Alex is a 36 year old video game tester who is creating his own game on the side. Typically, a pretty coworker is introduced to oversee the changes on a current game the company is developing. Alex isn't the only one with a thing for her. J.P., a bizarre programmer known for developing one of the most popular video games around, takes a liking to her too. And he also takes Alex's game and claims it to be his own. But will everything work out for Alex? Ah, I bet you can guess (as I easilly did) but Grandma's Boy is absolutely freaking hilarious. If you enjoy Sandler's movie productions, and you enjoy smoking pot (or at least laughing on the same levels as potheads do) then you will just love this movie.

I remember a time when people actually looked forward to movies with Adam Sandler or Will Ferrell (or the by-gone days when people looked forward to Eddie Murphy or Steve Martin movies).  And I still don't get how the Broken Lizard troupe gets money for their films.So I was extremely skeptical when I heard about GRANDMA'S BOY.  After all, it comes from Adam Sandler's production company.  I'm just thankful he wasn't in it with some goofy mugging or annoying accent.But GRANDMA'S BOY is funny.

Which means, I really don't like Adam Sandler's humor.It just wasn't all that funny collectively.  The plot didn't really happen until 15 minutes until the movie ended.  Then it seemed like the director thought he should end the movie with some sort of competition and victory.  Very poorly written.  The characters were interesting.  A guy who lives with his Grandma, a has-been-matrix-wanna-be, and the grandma herself.  It could've been much better.  A 30+ guy living with his grandma is funny in concept.  But, not in this movie.  I didn't even feel for his character.

If you like sex jokes-you will like this movie. If you like movies like The Benchwarmers-you will like this movie. If you like movies where old people do stupid or gross stuff-you will like this movie. If you didn't like any of the above-you will NOT like this movie. This movie also has great cameos-especially Rob Schnieder's at the start(I didn't understand a word he said, but I couldn't stop laughing).
