I've never been a fan of Lee Lee whatever her last name is and this movie solidifies her in my ""how did they get famous"" list.

1174994,AUJEF31CXWTCQ,B001C5LLKU,Amazon Customer,"[8, 10]","88 Minutes is the story of Dr. Jack Gramm (played by Al Pacino), a forensic scientist who works for the FBI. After providing testimony that puts a serial killer to jail, the killings mysterious start up again. It is here that the story starts.Without pulling any punches, this movie was horrendous. The script was one of the worst I have had to stomach all year. It was cheesy, horribly written, and provided the actors with so little to work with that it actually made Al Pacino look like a fool.A couple examples of its foolishness:1) Early in the movie, Jack Gramm helps a student who has been injured. In 15 minutes (we know because the movie is counting down actual time in minutes), the student manages to allow police to question her, have her injuries treated (we know this happened because she shows up again soon looking great!), go to Gramm's office for files, and show up at an apartment. All this in 15 minutes? In a major city, to boot.2) Near the end of the movie, the killer allows a woman tethered to a rope to slip down 20 feet. She pulls the rope back up with little effort, and in a few seconds. Later in the scene, the woman slips again, but this time 2 grown, healthy men struggle to pull the rope (and the woman) back up to safety.Another beef I had with this flick: product placement. Between the non-stop MSNBC promotion, the director slips in Dogpile.com and Terminex ads. Please, no commercials with my movie...thank you very much.Bottom line...this is one of the worst films I have viewed in 2008. Watch it at your own risk.

I mean, it takes the wind out of your sails when the killer says there's still 75 more minutes or 55 more minutes left to go--it's like clockwatching at a job you don't like! It's terrible and one of the hands down WORST movies of 2008 and of Pacino's legendary career.This movie is really bad. I am a big fan of Al Pacino, what was he thinking when he took this part.

1174997,A1TY4TRLA4QK5Y,B001C5LLKU,"Brian Long ""Brian""","[0, 1]","Al Pacino should've spoken up more regarding the script is this ham-handed psychological thriller. Pacino plays an eminent forensic psychologist that has put many in prison or on death row. After receiving numerous notices that he has less than 88 minutes to live, while simultaneously being framed for the murder of a prostitute, PAcino franctically scampes around the city to find the real culprit.The flaw in this was the movie itself. Suspension of disbelief wouldn't normally come into account on what appears to be an episode of Law and Order, or maybe closer to Without a Trace in this case. Pacinos driving alone would've taken up the entirety of his allowed time, assuming he didn't have a pocket teleporter or a police escort. The thriller aspect of the piece was to hammered in, with updates every 5-10 minutes, though an A for effort in actually keeping the correct time track.Pacinos character felt ham handed and stale, and the most I can remember of it is hands running through hair in exasperation x20. The supporting cast vanishes almost completely into the background, with recurring characters that are so forgettable that you fail to recognize them the second time they appear on screen.Despite all of this, 88 minutes managed to actually feel like a thriller, with a decent murder mystery thrown in. An overblown, surreal thriller, but a thriller none the less.

1175000,AZVEPWRYOFBX5,B001C5LLKU,Charity Bishop,"[1, 1]","Once filming ceased on this production, the studio kept from releasing this movie for over two years. Having sat through it, I am now painfully aware of their reasons why...If there's one thing the DA can count on, it's that criminal psychologist Jack Gramm (Al Pacino) is never wrong. Give him a couple of hours cross-examining your bad guy in private and he'll have a full report across your deck by morning, complete with behavioral patterns. He spends his professional time handling high-profile cases and his off-hours teaching at the local university. The one villain he has viciously fought to put behind bars (and a needle in his arm) is John Forster (Neal McDonough), a man accused of raping, torturing, and murdering several women. But the defense lawyers have accused Jack of tampering with the witness and giving false testimony, in an attempt to gain a stay of execution. It's about twelve hours away from them pulling the plug ... and things are about to get heated. On his way into the school, Jack receives an ominous phone call that warns him he has 88 minutes to live. Through the complicated mind games, cat and mouse phone calls, and various attempts to scare him, Jack must sort out whom he can trust -- and who might be working against him.The suspects are many but inevitably come down to his student aid, Kim (Alicia Witt), his loyal secretary and assistant Shelly (Amy Brenneman), and the various men in their lives. And when one of his students (Leelee Sobieski) is attacked and nearly abducted in the parking lot, Jack realizes not only his life is in danger... but everyone close to him.It's a movie that really should have worked. It has a lot going for it in terms of the potential of its subject material and it has Pacino, but for some reason nothing clicks. I hesitate in suggesting that actors have been miscast but it's obvious that Pacino was not the man to play Jack Gramm -- somewhere along the way, he seems to figure this out and simply gives up trying to make it believable. Pierce Brosnan would have been a much more likely candidate as a womanizing professor with an attitude problem, and we could believe all the girls in class falling for him with far greater ease. Pacino does better with dark, tormented characters and here the material isn't psychological enough for him. The supporting cast isn't horrible but reflect the dismal attitude of the star -- there's no chemistry between any of them and no passion for the project. I know it was a small budget film but it could have used a bit more energy -- and a better script. Moments that are meant to be charming just come off as absurd (such as asking for milk and cookies in the middle of a serious meeting).Everything about it is just wrong -- and no one knows who to blame. Part of the problem is that there are far too many suspects, red herrings, flashbacks, and fake-outs -- the audience grows tired of trying to figure out the crime and just go along for the ride. The climactic scene leaves something to be desired and some of the scenes and conversations just felt out of place. It's not to say that there isn't some good aspects -- entwining Jack's personal history with the case is an intelligent move, and the villain is appropriately menacing. There are a couple of decent shoot-outs and a mangled Porsche that will make any car lover cringe. But there are too many odd and unusual things -- as if the director set out to be original and creative when a standard approach would have done just fine. (One of the biggest ""huh?"" moments is when Jack finds the woman he slept with the night before doing a naked yoga position while brushing her teeth. Yes, it's just that weird.) There are enormous leaps in logic required to accept certain things (like a cop is just going to let a suspect leave? like a cop would fall for any of this in the first place?) and multiple loose ends.Content-wise, the opening scene is a woman being grabbed from behind, knocked unconscious, hoisted into the air, and ""cut"" by her attacker. Various other bodies are found in the same position, all of them half-naked. We see nudity on a woman from the side, and later in a short flashback, her bare breasts. Other women dress provocatively or are shown in underwear. Jack has had a one night stand. His secretary references being a lesbian -- later, we see her kiss another woman. There are some conversations about rape; a student attempts to seduce her professor. Various shoot-outs lead to dead bodies (rarely bloody), explosions and descriptions of crimes (including a twelve year old being ""cut apart"") are prevalent. A tape is played back of a girl being murdered. There are a half dozen uses of Jesus' name and GD, a handful of uses of s***t and one f-word.I can think of a dozen ways in which this script could have been improved, the presentation been streamlined to take better advantage of the acting talent, and where minor changes in cast could have transformed it into a first-rate thriller. Unfortunately, it's not my job to ""fix"" screenplays, only review them and as such I find 88 Minutes a complete and total waste of time.",3,Parental Review,1363824000,"03 21,

1175001,A18G7GG53G2X8A,B001C5LLKU,Chris Pandolfi,"[0, 5]","The mystery in ""88 Minutes"" builds and builds ... and keeps on building after the movie ends because we're not sure how any of it could actually happen. The plot is easy enough to understand, but there are specifics that push the boundaries of suspension of disbelief. It was as if screenwriter Gary Scott Thompson was purposely trying to misdirect us back to a foreseen conclusion; we think all throughout that the final revelation will be unexpected, but it ends up being exactly what we expect. I'm being annoyingly vague, but rest assured you'll know exactly what I'm talking about should you decide to see this film. The end isn't all that surprising, and the events that lead up to the end certainly aren't plausible; ""88 Minutes"" just kind of rolls with the punches without trying to be original, believable, or satisfying.The film opens in September of 1997 in Seattle, in which a serial killer breaks into the home of two sisters. Both are silenced with an animal sedative and hanged upside down. The rope is only attached to one ankle; the other leg is allowed to dangle freely. The killer then begins slicing one of the girls with a scalpel until she dies. The other sister is spared because she screams just as the killer opens the door to quiet the hungry cat. The man arrested and charged for the crime was Jon Foster (Neal McDonough), who was finally convicted and sentenced to death based on the damning expert opinion of Dr. Jack Gramm (Al Pacino), a forensic psychologist. As soon as the sentence is read, Foster and Gramm exchange glances, after which Foster ominously whispers, ""Tic tock, doc.""The story then flashes forward nine years. Still on death row, Foster continues to maintain his innocence as well as his hatred for Gramm, who he says persuaded the jury into believing falsified evidence. Now a teacher at the University of Northwest Washington, Gramm one day receives a call on his cell phone--the electronically altered voice at the other end of the line tells him that he has only eighty-eight minutes to live. At first he doesn't take the threat seriously, since someone in his line of work receives death threats often. But to be sure, he calls his office and asks his secretary, Shelly Barnes (Amy Brennerman), to contact his provider and have them trace his last call. This is the first in a series of favors he will ask throughout the film; it seems like all he can do is order people to look up names and retrieve information. It gets boring after a while.Gramm is then informed that one of his students was murdered the night before, and what's worse, it was an exact copy of the murder nine years earlier. This looks bad for Gramm since he was with this student the night she died. A number of other people were also with him, and it's suggested that one of them knows something they're not telling. I dare not say whether or not this is true, but I will say that Gramm receives another phone call later on in class, and his minutes have dropped down to seventy-nine. He now knows that the threat is serious. From that point on, he regards absolutely every character with an air of suspicion, students, employees, and federal agents alike. The audience is also suspicious because everyone seems to be hiding something: some follow Foster's case too eagerly; some are getting too close to Gramm, like his student, Lauren Douglas (Leelee Sobieski); some have that funny look in their eye, like they're ready to shoot someone.What this basically boils down to is who the killer is, why the killer is trying to frame Gramm, and what this has to do with Foster. The number of red herrings in this mystery is maddening, and this is because they're all the result of suspicious character behavior. One student--Mike Stempt (Benjamin McKensie)--circles around Gramm like a vulture, pressuring him into admitting that Foster may be innocent. Nothing comes of it. A man in leather motorcycle jacket named Guy LaForge (Stephen Moyer) seems to be hunting Gramm down, and we're not sure if it has anything to do with his ex-wife, Kim (Alicia Witt), who happens to be Gramm's teaching assistant. Nothing comes of that, either. At one point, Gramm reports a campus security guard named Johnny D'Franco (Brendan Fletcher) for no reason other than not liking him, and indeed, D'Franco seems like a volcano ready to erupt. Still, nothing comes of it.So what exactly are we left with if every new direction ultimately brings us back to where we knew it would end up in the first place? We have a pretty bland murder mystery that doesn't bother with realism and doesn't delve too deeply into its characters. We do learn about Gramm's painful past at a certain point, and while I won't describe it, I will say that it doesn't add much to the story other than an excuse to add more drama and cleverness to the plot. There are some tense moments that defy logic, such as when Gramm returns to his car only to find the windows smashed and the words ""72 minutes"" written across the trunk; you can't help but wonder how the perpetrator knew that he would return to his car exactly at the seventy-two minute mark. But the biggest problem of ""88 Minutes"" is a mystery that initially gets too mysterious then doesn't end mysteriously enough. Too many false alarms, too few surprises, and an overabundance of characters don't amount to entertainment--they only amounts to a headache.",3,A Few Seconds Short of a Minute,1208822400,"04 22,

Al Pacino - I was surprised to find him this awful film, he's the only one really trying but the script, direction, production and, let's just say the whole film gives him no room to work in.Premise : Pacino plays Jack Gramm, a noted forensic psychologist, testifies at the murder trial of a Seattle serial killer who is subsequently sentenced to death. A short time before the execution, similar killings begin happening again. Gramm gets a call telling him ""tick tock...you have 88 minutes to live""...and we're lead on a chase to find the killer in a world where everyone's a suspect and the movie tries so terribly hard to make us think that Gramm might have been wrong...or that he might even be the killer...OH NO!A supporting cast that includes some talent (Leelee Sobieski, Neal McDonough and William Forsythe) do little to help either Pacino or themselves. This feels like a script that was passed over by other ""action"" actors in the twilight of their careers such as Harrison Ford or Clint Eastwood. Personally, I think William Hurt might have stood a better chance. Pacino just isn't psychologist material...but damn he looks good for 70 (give or take) - I hope my hair looks that cool and I'm able to run up a flight of stairs at that age too.Hollywood has suffered for several years from feeling the need to have to explain everything to the audience in painstaking detail, suggesting that they think we're stupid. This film doesn't really need explaining, though some of the ""how did he/she do this"" is given to us at the end in a Sherlock Holmes style description (ie we had no chance of figuring some things out).88 Minutes leaves you thinking ""huh...I just wasted 108 minutes watching it"".1 star because Pacino should have known better.

1175022,AIFXFHO2N9WJB,B001C5LLKU,"Justice0309 ""Justice""","[2, 2]","I feel fairly confident in stating that veteran actor Al Pacino (""The Godfather"" trilogy, ""Any Given Sunday"", ""Serpico"") is easily one of the greatest actors ever to appear on the silver screen. With that being said, is it just me or is anyone else scratching their head over one of Al's recent releases, the supposed thriller ""88 Minutes"", which has become the worst reviewed movie of Pacino's illustrious career. If you haven't seen the movie yet, once you do I'm sure you'll join me and many others in wondering, ""Why does a man as successful as Al Pacino debase himself by starring in this piece of cinematic garbage?""""88 Minutes"" follows one extremely stressful day in the life of forensic psychologist Jack Gramm (Al Pacino) as he receives a threatening phone call claiming that he only has 88 minutes to live (hence the name). To make things worse, a killer is leaving a trail of bodies that just so happen to be friends/colleagues or students of Gramm's. Now, suspicions are on the rise that Jack may have snapped; all the while time is ticking away for Jack to discover who is committing these murders, which of his colleagues and/or students may be killed next, and most important of all, how he can survive the following 88 minutes of his day.So, after viewing this less than thrilling thriller, which for some reason lasted nearly 20 minutes past the 88 minutes of story the movie actually has in store, I find myself pondering the question I posed a few moments ago, regarding Al's questionable decision to star in such an obviously bad film that is nothing more than a pale imitation of a sub-par episode of any ""CSI"" or ""Law and Order"" series. Surely, the script read as poorly on paper as it sounded in the context of the movie. Well Al, can you answer my question or are you just as dumbfounded as the rest of us? That's what I thought, you're as dumbfounded by your decision to star in this garbage as we are (I felt like giving him the benefit of the doubt based on his numerous years of cinematic greatness that he has given us).The story for ""88 Minutes"" holds promise early on, but by approximately 20 to 30 minutes into the film one quickly realizes that things are beginning to go awry and soon after that the material completely spirals out of control amidst a mess of more red herrings than an entire season of Scooby-Doo, a cornucopia of continuity errors, and impossible coincidences that are too obvious to ignore. Writer Gary Scott Thompson (TV's ""Las Vegas"") is not exactly a stranger to compelling drama, but for some reason he wasn't able to squeeze any out of his script for this movie. I think the concept for the movie sounded good on paper, but when trying to flesh out the script Thompson most likely realized that the concept wouldn't be able to hold up without relying on absurd coincidences. I believe Thompson, in an attempt to somewhat disguise the over-reliance on coincidences that are completely improbable, chose to introduce as many red herrings as he possibly could, to the point that as a viewer you eventually lose track of which ones you've eliminated as possible suspects and you just take a shot in the dark regarding who the guilty party may be. Whatever the case may actually be, one thing is for certain, the movie's story is far too contrived and jumbled for any person to actually enjoy sitting through it from start to finish.The continuity errors sprinkled all throughout ""88 Minutes"" could be attributed some to the writing, but in the end the director, Jon Avnet (""Righteous Kill""), does have control over what ones will be visible in the final product. This for me became a major distraction over the course of the movie; for instance, in one scene a car is shown vandalized, yet five to ten minutes later that very same vehicle is shown in completely pristine condition and the vandalism disappearing is never touched upon as being fixed and due to the 88 minute plot device, there was never any time for the car to be repaired, hence one major error that should have been caught on the set or in the script and wasn't. One other example would be Al Pacino's crazy hairstyle in this movie. I don't normally pay too close of attention to an actor or actresses hair in a movie, but his was so odd and varying from moment to moment that it was hard to miss, and the hair seemed like it was almost alive and taking on a life all its own at times. Granted the former is a much bigger problem than the latter in terms of complaints about the movie; yet both serve as prime examples for a couple of instances where continuity was obviously ignored, and the problem permeated into almost every scene of the film.Speaking of Al Pacino I normally enjoy his performances even in movies that aren't always the greatest, he at least provides some semblance of entertainment. In this movie, Al seems hardly invested in the role, as if he's just going through the motions to collect a paycheck that I hardly believe he was in such desperate need of to sign on to such a ridiculous project. Generally, in every Pacino movie there is a moment or two where Al kind of goes over-the-top, not to the point of bad acting, it's just something you come to expect from him through his intense portrayal of his various roles, and in a way you kind of look forward to it; yet in this movie he maybe does it once, and not to the extent that any real intensity is conveyed. That lack of intensity gave me a clear indication of how little Al actually cared for the material he was being given to work with here.Supporting Al's uninspired performance were some fairly recognizable faces ranging from the always reliable character actor William Forsythe (""Gotti""), to former TV stars Amy Brenneman (""Judging Amy"") and Neil McDonough (""Boomtown""), to some of Hollywood's obscure young talents Leelee Sobieski (""Joy Ride"") and Alicia Witt (""Urban Legend""). Most of the supporting cast was decent in their various roles, although Leelee Sobieski seemed a little forced in her performance, not feeling all that natural in her role as a student to Jack Gramm. Perhaps this was due to the fact that maybe she was aware of how ridiculous this movie actually was, I do not know, but whatever the reason, she just didn't seem comfortable in her role from the moment her character was introduced.What it all boils down to is this, ""88 Minutes"" is one of the worst movies, if not the worst movie of 2008, and by far is the worst movie in Al Pacino's highly successful career. A poor story full of contrived plot points, inconsistencies, and a running time that doesn't end soon enough, ""88 Minutes"" will have you bored and looking for the stop button long before the credits will begin to roll.""88 Minutes"" is rated R for violence and language.",1,What Were You Thinking Al?

Another excellent performance by Al Pachino and fine supporting performances by other actors and actresses you will likely recognize, I just don't know their names.  I guess you would call this a psychological thriller/serial killer movie.  Pachino plays a highly sought after forensic psychologist, who often testifies for the prosecution and against the killer, so, you can imagine that he has made life-long enemies.The movie begins in the home/apartment of 2 sisters.  Someone broke in, disguised in all black, tortured and killed one of the sisters.  The next stop is the court room, where Pachino is called as a subject-matter expert to testify against the likelihood of the guy they have in custody (John Forrester) being the serial killer, also known as the ""Seattle Slayer"".  (By the way, guess what city the murders are in?).  Mainly because of Pachino (Dr. Graham's) testimony as an expert witness, the Forrester is found ""guilty with special circumstances,"" whatever that meant.  At the trial, Forrester turns to the Doctor and says, ""Tick Tock, Doc"" in a whisper.Fast-forward to 9 years later and there is another kill, the same MO as the Seattle Slayer.  The police call in Dr. Graham. You start to think that maybe Forrester is out, somehow, but then you hear that he is scheduled for execution soon.  Doc is out celebrating the court victory (past all the appeals) and the next morning, one of the ladies he knows is found dead and things start to happen that make it appear that the Doc is being set up.  Then the Doc begins to get strange calls on his cell.  The first one has a guy's voice, obviously run through some sort of synthesizing equipment, saying, ""You have 88 minutes to live. Tick Tock, Doc.""  The pace picks up as the countdown progresses.

Everything is overdone or overwrought - including Pacino.  He is constantly startled and running from one unbelievable situation to the next.  The whole idea of 88 minutes to die is contrived and nonsensical.  It had every cliche and trick in the book on serial killers.  The ridiculous twists and turns were laughable.Whoever wrote and edited this film obviously were banking on Pacino to save it.  Pacino can do a lot, but in this romp he was running from place to place while a superhuman assistant was getting anything he asked done in a matter of minutes.  It was implausible!

Today, Jon is set to be executed for his crimes.Jack not only has his own psychiatric firm, but he also teaches at the University of Washington in Seattle.  He wakes up this morning to learn that one of his students was killed exactly the say way that Jon killed women.Then he receives the phone call.  ""You have 88 minutes to live.  At 11:45, you will die.""  At first he considers it a crank, but the more the person calls back, the more he takes it seriously.  Is Jon guilty?  Who murdered his student?  And who is going to kill him?I was attracted to this film because of the ticking clock premise.  I am a sucker for those kind of stories, I guess.  And as a thriller, it worked.  I spent plenty of time cringing waiting for the next big event to come, hoping it wouldn't scare me.I thought I had the villain pin pointed early on, but turned out to be wrong.  Once I figured that out, I did pick up on the true villain earlier then I would have liked and spent the rest of the movie waiting for Jack to catch up.Which brings me to the main problem with the film; it was predictable.  And for a thriller, that's never a good thing.  And it didn't help that the previews gave away way too much.And I can't forget the slow start.  Yes, we needed the information.  But it could have been given to us once the story got started.  As it was, I was almost bored before the prologue ended and the action began.Additionally, the characters were rather flat.  We're talking one dimensional at best.  Heck, I never even connected with Jack.  The only reason he got my sympathy was because I was afraid I'd jump during those tense scenes.As a side note, do that that R rating seriously.  The images of the murders are rather graphic.  I had to look away a few times.Despite all the negatives, this thriller is mildly entertaining.  See it if you must.

Pacino is one of the greatest actors we have working today and even in a tepid film such as this, he gives it his all.88 MINUTES stars Pacino as Dr. Jack Gramm, a forensic psychologist who has just helped put away a serial killer we saw strike (in shadow only). Jon Forster (Neal McDonough) has been convicted and awaits the death sentence.The story moves forward 9 years and Gramm is still at it. He also teaches a course at a college in the city the story is set in, Seattle. On the day of Forster's sentence to be carried out, Jack receives a cryptic message via his cell phone. He has just 88 minutes left to live.While we have been given glimpses into Jack's life, his womanizing, his binging, his somewhat flawed character, nothing can prepare us for this and what follows. Jack attempts to locate who is sending him these messages and try and stop his own murder.At the same time Forster receives a stay of execution and Jack's abilities are called in to question. When people begin showing up dead that are connected to Jack, the table is turned as the FBI task force investigating a new series of murders that are identical to those of Forster, suspect Jack. The clock continues to tick down as Jack, aided by just a few friends, searches for the answers.Along the way we are offered something else. We are given a glimpse into the world of Jack Gramm. What is it that motivated him to take up this career to begin with? Was he guilty of witness tampering? Was he somehow involved in the murders? And did he set up Forster for the killings or was Forster actually guilty?The answers to these question and others are all solved within the 88 minutes it takes for Jack to discover them as well. A bit of soul searching, a bit of sleuthing and a bit of luck bring us to a conclusion that offers several red herrings before the truth is revealed.Pacino turns in a great performance, though perhaps not one of his best. But even here his abilities are a sight to behold. Along with him is a great supporting cast including Alicia Witt as a student aid trying to help, Amy Brenneman as his harried secretary, Leelee Sobieski as a promising student and William Forsythe as Jack's FBI associate and friend. Among them Forsythe has always been a favorite of mine and one of the unsung heroes of character actors working today.If you are a fan of mysteries there is the chance that you will figure this one out prior to the last moments of the film unspooling before you. I was able to do so for the most part. I got the set up, just not the particulars. But that is what makes a mystery so involving. Trying to figure out just ""who-dun-it"". 88 MINUTES gives you the chance to figure it all out ahead of time. And with Pacino at the helm onscreen, you get the clues and a great performance all rolled in to one.Having written this upon the DVD's initial release I've had time to think back and digest everything better than I did at first. Yes, the movie is solid film making. Yes, Pacino turns in a well done performance. But at the same time something seems lacking here.Have you ever had a viewing experience where you thought ""I kind of enjoyed that but yet there was just something not right, something just...."". That is this movie in a nutshell. Perhaps a second viewing will make me find what I thought was missing. But my gut instinct tells me no.Don't get me wrong, this movie was still better than half a dozen others I've watched. But at the same time, expectations when it comes to someone like Pacino leave this one lacking.",2,YOUR TIME IS UP,1231804800,"01 13, 2009",2009,3735,"['am', 'big', 'fan', 'Al', 'Pacino', 'have', ""n't"", 'been', 'many', 'times', 'when', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'film', 'starred', ""'ve"", 'been', 'disappointed', 'wo', ""n't"", 'name', 'two', 'times', 'happened', 'can', 'recall', 'here', 'Pacino', 'one', 'greatest', 'actors', 'have', 'working', 'today', 'even', 'tepid', 'film', 'such', 'all.88', 'MINUTES', 'Pacino', 'Dr.', 'Jack', 'Gramm', 'forensic', 'psychologist', 'who', 'just', 'helped', 'put', 'away', 'serial', 'killer', 'saw', 'strike', 'shadow', 'only', 'Jon', 'Forster', 'Neal', 'McDonough', 'been', 'convicted', 'death', 'sentence.The', 'story', 'forward', '9', 'years', 'Gramm', 'still', 'also', 'course', 'college', 'city', 'story', 'set', 'Seattle', 'day', 'Forster', 'sentence', 'be', 'carried', 'out', 'Jack', 'cryptic', 'message', 'cell', 'phone', 'just', '88', 'minutes', 'left', 'have', 'been', 'given', 'glimpses', 'Jack', 'life', 'womanizing', 'binging', 'somewhat', 'flawed', 'character', 'nothing', 'can', 'prepare', 'what', 'Jack', 'locate', 'who', 'sending', 'messages', 'try', 'stop', 'own', 'murder.At', 'same', 'time', 'Forster', 'stay', 'execution', 'Jack', 'abilities', 'are', 'called', 'question', 'When', 'people', 'begin', 'showing', 'up', 'dead', 'are', 'connected', 'Jack', 'table', 'turned', 'FBI', 'task', 'force', 'investigating', 'new', 'series', 'murders', 'are', 'identical', 'Forster', 'suspect', 'Jack', 'clock', 'tick', 'down', 'as', 'Jack', 'aided', 'just', 'few', 'friends', 'searches', 'answers.Along', 'way', 'are', 'offered', 'something', 'else', 'are', 'given', 'glimpse', 'world', 'Jack', 'Gramm', 'What', 'motivated', 'take', 'up', 'career', 'begin', 'Was', 'guilty', 'witness', 'tampering', 'Was', 'somehow', 'involved', 'murders', 'did', 'set', 'up', 'Forster', 'killings', 'was', 'Forster', 'actually', 'guilty', 'answers', 'question', 'others', 'are', 'solved', '88', 'minutes', 'Jack', 'discover', 'as', 'well', 'bit', 'soul', 'searching', 'bit', 'sleuthing', 'bit', 'luck', 'bring', 'conclusion', 'several', 'red', 'herrings', 'truth', 'revealed.Pacino', 'turns', 'great', 'performance', 'perhaps', 'not', 'one', 'best', 'even', 'here', 'abilities', 'are', 'sight', 'behold', 'great', 'supporting', 'cast', 'including', 'Alicia', 'Witt', 'student', 'aid', 'trying', 'help', 'Amy', 'Brenneman', 'harried', 'secretary', 'Leelee', 'Sobieski', 'promising', 'student', 'William', 'Forsythe', 'Jack', 'FBI', 'associate', 'friend', 'Forsythe', 'always', 'been', 'favorite', 'mine', 'one', 'unsung', 'heroes', 'character', 'actors', 'working', 'today.If', 'are', 'fan', 'mysteries', 'chance', 'will', 'figure', 'one', 'out', 'prior', 'last', 'moments', 'film', 'unspooling', 'was', 'able', 'do', 'so', 'most', 'part', 'got', 'set', 'up', 'just', 'not', 'particulars', 'what', 'mystery', 'so', 'involving', 'Trying', 'figure', 'out', 'just', 'who-dun-it', '88', 'MINUTES', 'chance', 'figure', 'out', 'ahead', 'time', 'Pacino', 'helm', 'onscreen', 'get', 'clues', 'great', 'performance', 'rolled', 'one.Having', 'written', 'DVD', 'initial', 'release', ""'ve"", 'had', 'time', 'think', 'back', 'digest', 'everything', 'better', 'did', 'first', 'Yes', 'movie', 'solid', 'film', 'making', 'Yes', 'Pacino', 'well', 'done', 'performance', 'same', 'time', 'something', 'lacking', 'here.Have', 'ever', 'had', 'viewing', 'experience', 'where', 'thought', 'kind', 'enjoyed', 'yet', 'was', 'just', 'something', 'not', 'right', 'something', 'just', 'movie', 'nutshell', 'Perhaps', 'second', 'viewing', 'will', 'make', 'find', 'what', 'thought', 'was', 'missing', 'gut', 'instinct', 'tells', 'no.Do', ""n't"", 'get', 'wrong', 'movie', 'was', 'still', 'better', 'dozen', 'others', ""'ve"", 'watched', 'same', 'time', 'expectations', 'when', 'someone', 'Pacino', 'leave', 'one', 'lacking']",N/A

1175037,AVVXC6B1O3CLU,B001C5LLKU,Milkyway Movie Lover,"[9, 12]","I read how a reviewer was disgruntled over the woman pulling up another woman using a pulley and how minutes later two men had to struggle to do the same thing and how rediculous it seemed to him/her.  So when it got to that part I took notice, and at first agreed, but then when I watched it closer the second time I saw they in fact made it totally realistic according to what really takes place. When Al Pacino hurries to grab the rope before the suspended woman falls to her death he grabs it at the last pully. Mind you he is laying on the ground. If you've ever worked with pulleys, and I have, You need to be pulling from a standing position to put your whole upper body into it, including your back and shoulders. You need to overcome the inertia before the rope starts to feel the let off from the wheels of the pulleys. But, the key issue here is that as he tries to get a better hold he then grabs the rope above the last pulley wheel thereby eliminating its helpful effect. anyone might have done this without realizing their error and having to ""lift"" more of the actual weight without the pulley's help. If you're ever used a lever and fulcrum you know you can't lift a heavy sidewalk with a one foot lever, but with an 8 foot one the ""leverage"" is increased dramatically and up comes the sidewalk much much easier. the same principle applies here. Also, I didnt notice if she was wearing gloves or not, I have some that are rubber lined and they can pull a rope much easier, so there could even be other reasons, but the main point here is that the whole thing was extremely realistic. the true problem lies with why do people knock an entire movie based on some tiny little detail which they never understood properly anyway?  Is that sensible?  No! So we can disregard such petty reviews. Things like hair looking ""poofy,"" as someone overly critical slams Pacino, as if his looks make or break a good movie. how petty and unimportant! The facts, which I can attest to are simple once again. I live in Ohio, but I used to date a woman in Los Angeles and during my visits there the Santa Anna winds some times blow in dry air from the dessert and I can tell you my hair was so frizzy and ""poofy"" as if I was into some off the wall look. All the locals know it happens, and its useless to try to fight it. unless you want to put hair spray on your hair, you get poofy looking.  its a fact of life like gravity. The bottom line is, this is not a 2 or 3 star movie, its quite good actually and I'm glad I bought it. It's a movie I'll watch again next year as I cycle through my DVD movie collection. So, my advice is to blow off these low mentalities who find the most idiotic reasons to slander good movies. Then decide for yourself. I know good acting, and Al Pacino doesn't let us down one bit, as usual. I would have given this 4.5 stars,, but it needs to be lifted from the pit of inaccurate reviews so I give it 5 for justice sake!

Clues in the call tell him it is to do with a case from his past when his testimony was responsible for putting a man on death row.

Even when the film sucks, like this one kind of does, he does something to make it watchable and entertaining for fans. Here he plays forensic psychologist Jack Gramm. In addition to his medical practice, Jack teaches a criminal studies class at a local college. He's a a bit of a ladies man after hours keeping company with call girls, his students (Alicia Witt and Lelee Sobieski), his secretary (Amy Brenneman) and even the dean of the college (Deborah Kara Ungar). It was Jack's crucial testimony years earlier that earned a rapist (Neal McDonough) the death penalty. On the day of the execution, Jack awakes to find a man on a motorcycle outside his house. When he arrives at work he sees that the motorcyclist has followed him. He then gets a call on his cell phone in which someone tells him he has only 88 minutes left to live. Jack starts an investigation that has his put upon gay secretary (Brenneman) making about a hundred phone calls and checking the records of the prison, his students, the woman he was with last night and so on and so forth. Jack is clueless as to who is taunting him and his paranoia causes him to run around campus like a madman snatching cell phones away from terrified students. Teaming up with one of his students (Witt), Jack attempts to prove that the murderer he put away is behind this latest threat. The film takes place in real time once Jack is threatened but it's never all that suspenseful. Jack takes the news in stride and he and Witt go to his apartment and basically chill for a half hour until he gets another phone call telling him where to go. Once the person's identity is revealed there have been so many ridiculous twists and turns that the film becomes laughable. The best scene involves an exasperated Jack yelling at an FBI guy (William Forsythe) who believes Jack is behind it all. ""Did I blow up my own car? Did I shoot bullets at myself?"", Jack yells. (His explanation of how his ""DNA"" came to be found on a murder victim is also pretty funny). Hell, in the bonus features Pacino admits that much of the film is illogical but that he was still attracted to the material for whatever reason. He says he had a good time making it but that doesn't guarantee that fans will have a good time watching it. The film was made way back in 2005 and shelved for nearly three years.

Zwick,"[6, 8]","In ""88 Minutes,"" a gimmicky crime thriller directed by Jon Avnet, Al Pacino plays Jack Gramm, a forensic psychiatrist and university professor whose testimony played a crucial role in the conviction of a serial killer nine years earlier.  Now, on the day the man is to be executed, Jack receives an anonymous phone call informing him that he has only 88 minutes to live.  Could it be that the doomed-to-die convict has found a way to exact his own form of personal vengeance before heading off to that great big penitentiary in the sky?Now, upon getting this message, does Jack drive himself to the nearest police station and have himself put under protective custody, as any reasonable and sensible person would surely do?  Heavens no.  Instead, he races all over metropolitan Seattle, systematically confronting everyone he views as a possible suspect - which, it turns out, is pretty much any person who is in any way involved with his life - while the ticking clock brings him ever closer to his prescribed end.Gary Scott Thompson's mess of a screenplay stretches credibility beyond the breaking point, throwing so many red herrings and plot inconsistencies at the audience that we simply give up trying to make any sense out of it.  Plus, in any story in which literally every single character (including Jack himself) is, at one point or another, a possible suspect, we know we're being played for fools and our resentment towards those who made the film begins to boil over in a serious way.  In the final analysis, there's really no way to keep such a scenario from becoming more and more laughable and ridiculous the longer it goes on.  In fact, the best line in the film goes to one of Jack's students who, after her ex-boyfriend has been shot and killed, an entire apartment building evacuated due to poisonous gas, and Jack's car blown to smithereens, all in the space of a few minutes, casually mutters, ""What next?""  It`s the same question the eye-rolling audience has been asking itself throughout the course of the movie.  And to top it all off, the final confrontation scene is so preposterously staged and absurdly overacted that it feels almost like a parody of a crime thriller denouement.  This may not be the worst script ever written, but you sure gotta' give `em props for trying.It's no exaggeration to suggest that this supremely idiotic thriller may well stand as the undisputed nadir of Pacino's otherwise long and distinguished career.

He's a forensic psychologist with a long list of enemies as he's put many in jail with his expert testimony alone.  There are some good twists now and then in this story and, as many have already pointed out, lots of red herring too.The direction is brisk and unobtrusive, but the script lacks the punch to support the director's attempt to make things exciting.  This is also one of those films in which the supporting cast is better than the main cast.  Pacino seems to be bored with this film and literally looks like he's acting panic-stricken.  I mean, I can open my eyes wide too, but that doesn't mean I really look scared, does it?  This is what critics call a ""phoned in performance"" that is often done by top actors to keep themselves busy until their next terrific film.  It's treated like a part-time or temporary job.  Now, the presence of the decent looking and okay acting talent of Alicia Witt, the stunning and very talented Helen Hunt lookalike, Leelee Sobieski, and TV'sJudging Amywho makes 40+ look like a fantastic age to be, Amy Brenneman, are all far more interesting to watch than Pacino is in this film.This isn't a bad movie and will make a decent rental, but don't expect a whole lot from this film as you might because of Al Pacino's presence.  He's way off his game here and his supporting cast really outshine him, even though that doesn't take much with his performance in this film.FYI:  While the film made a tidy profit having cost 30 million to make, although that is hard to believe, it made about 70 million here in the states, it still got yanked from theaters after only a few weeks.  It couldn't even break double digits on it's opening weekend where it made just under 7 million.

After all the film has Al Pacino, perhaps the only reason the film didn't go straight to DVD. But maybe it should have.""88 Minutes"" starts with one unnecessary murder scene and one insipid courtroom scene after that, both of which would tell us what kind of film we are going to see. A ""killer"" Jon Forster (Neal McDonough) is caught, and in his trial Al Pacino's character forensic psychiatrist and college professor Dr. Jack Gramm gives a testimony, which decides the fate of the accused - death sentence. Unfortunately, nothing is believable, convincing and most importantly thrilling in this terribly directed opening part.And the film gets worse from there. Cue to nine years later. Jon Forster is going to be executed today, but another murder (with a similar MO and a video tape, too) shocks the authority. Then Jack, who believes it is a copycat case, receives a threatening call telling he has only 88 minutes left to live (accompanied with ""tick-tock""). The persistent messages never stop (some of which Jack receives in written form) and Jack starts to take them seriously.Sadly, none of us would because of the film's utter silliness. I cannot write in detail here, but things get more and more preposterous as the contrived story goes on. I know any thrillers need suspension of disbelief, but mine just ran out when I saw overacting Al Pacino's character running wild holding a gun in the city of Seattle. Also, according to the conclusion, the criminal (or criminals?) are so smart and resourceful like John McClane that almost anything is possible.You probably know this, but ""88 Minutes"" employs a unique narrative gimmick similar to the one seen in, say, ""Nick of Time""; that is, from the very moment Jack is told that he has only 88 minutes left to live, the film runs exactly the same amount of time - 88 minutes, which feels much longer than it actually is. The concept of real-time ""88 minutes"" is rather pointless because a good thriller would make us forget its running time. But this does not happen here.The film's cast includes Alicia Witt, Leelee Sobieski and Deborah Kara Unger. The supports (which also include William Forsythe) are interesting and I know they are all talented, but I'm afraid Jon Avnet's badly-directed film would only make us believe otherwise.

Sadly, the film failed to deliver on pretty much all accounts.For a basic plot summary, ""88 Minutes"" focuses on Prof. Jack Gramm (Pacino), who (after contributing to the death sentence of a supposed serial murderer) is drawn into a cat-and-mouse game with the inmate when, inexplicably, the same type of murders start up again.  All the while, Gramm is being threatened by mysterious phone calls as the clock ticks down on him from...88 minutes.Succinctly speaking, this film is an absolute mess.  I have no idea what director John Avnet was thinking.  In the first thirty minutes, the plot seems to be developing and the important characters seem to be taking shape.  From that point, however, it's as if Avnet puts his finger in the metaphorical batter-bowl and just stirs everything up...without baking.  Thus, most of the plot points brought up in the early goings just fizzle out, while the ones that do come to fruition do so with little to no drama.  By the final scene, it's a complete and utter mess.About the only redeeming factor in this movie whatsoever is the acting of Al Pacino.  He can still carry a movie with his intense mannerisms and stinging dialogue.  Unfortunately, he isn't given nearly enough of those scenes here and seems stifled (perhaps that is what happens when his character is so poorly written).  The same is true for the auxiliary cast.  I know that Amy Brennamen, Leelee Sobieski, and Alicia Witt are competent actors, but (in this movie) their characters are so uninspiring that it's impossible to inject them with any life.Overall, I would skip this Pacino effort and never look back.

In the courtroom, as the sentence is handed down, Forster sneers at Gramm and says ""Tick Tock..."" - apparently the countdown to Gramm's death has begun, and he only has 88 minutes to live/figure out what is going on.The plot moves along at a rapid pace, but suffers from exaggeration, stereotypes, and mediocre dialogue - Al Pacino's harried psychiatrist seems too sure of himself, and his acting here isn't much to watch, given to over-exaggeration and unnecessary swaggering, running along the crowded streets of Seattle, waving his gun around. His mostly female cast are also wasted - there's the gay admin, played by Amy Brenneman, teaching assistant Alicia Witt, and star student LeeLee Sobieski [in a less than credible role]. Perhaps this movie also suffers from too many characters vying for a significant spot in the storyline.Ultimately, the movie fails to connect despite the interesting premise and well-known cast - even the close-up shots of victims seems gratuitous and unnecessary. Final verdict - lacklustre thriller. I'd rather re-watch some of Pacino's better thrillers like ""Sea of Love"" and ""Insomnia"".",2,Lackluster thriller with a wasted cast,1221782400,"09 19, 2008",2008,1510,"['88', 'Minutes', 'definitely', 'not', 'one', 'Al', 'Pacino', 'better', 'movies', 'thriller', 'suffers', 'trite', 'dialogue', 'wasted', 'cast', 'well-known', 'names', 'poor', 'direction', 'not', 'mention', 'incredulous', 'plot.The', 'story', 'around', 'forensic', 'psychiatrist', 'Dr', 'Jack', 'Gramm', '[', 'Al', 'Pacino', ']', 'crucial', 'testimony', 'convicts', 'condemns', 'serial', 'murderer', 'Jon', 'Forster', '[', 'Neal', 'McDonough', ']', 'death', 'sentence', 'courtroom', 'sentence', 'handed', 'down', 'Forster', 'sneers', 'Gramm', 'Tick', 'Tock', 'apparently', 'countdown', 'Gramm', 'death', 'begun', 'only', '88', 'minutes', 'live/figure', 'out', 'what', 'going', 'on.The', 'plot', 'moves', 'along', 'rapid', 'pace', 'suffers', 'exaggeration', 'stereotypes', 'mediocre', 'dialogue', 'Al', 'Pacino', 'harried', 'psychiatrist', 'too', 'sure', 'acting', 'here', ""n't"", 'much', 'watch', 'given', 'over-exaggeration', 'unnecessary', 'swaggering', 'running', 'along', 'crowded', 'streets', 'Seattle', 'waving', 'gun', 'around', 'mostly', 'female', 'cast', 'are', 'also', 'wasted', 'gay', 'admin', 'played', 'Amy', 'Brenneman', 'teaching', 'assistant', 'Alicia', 'Witt', 'star', 'student', 'LeeLee', 'Sobieski', '[', 'less', 'credible', 'role', ']', 'Perhaps', 'movie', 'also', 'too', 'many', 'characters', 'vying', 'significant', 'spot', 'storyline.Ultimately', 'movie', 'connect', 'interesting', 'premise', 'well-known', 'cast', 'even', 'close-up', 'shots', 'victims', 'gratuitous', 'unnecessary', 'Final', 'verdict', 'lacklustre', 'thriller', ""'d"", 'rather', 're-watch', 'Pacino', 'better', 'thrillers', 'Sea', 'Love', 'Insomnia']",N/A
