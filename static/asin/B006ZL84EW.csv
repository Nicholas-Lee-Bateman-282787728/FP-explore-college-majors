""Endeavour"" is the pilot for the upcoming British series that goes back in time to reveal a young Morse working on his first real police case, giving us one more opportunity to get to know one of our favorite English detectives.Basically it's the same folks who've given us the Morse series and later the very successful (and very well done ) Sergeant Lewis series--and no complaints.  In this pilot, sometimes a bit rough at the edges and certainly evolves into a bit of a melodramatic ending, a young Shawn Evans gives us great background--and understanding--of the inimitable Morse.  It's a good biographical study--but only enough to give us a better knowledge of what makes Morse tick.In this initial episode, a young (15-year-old) girl turns up missing and soon after turns up very dead.  Young Morse is assigned to the case and, well, the story goes from there, with the usual  Colin Dexterian-like twists, turns, reversals, and surprises. What is not surprising, of course, is that Morse is on the scene. We know what to expect.For Morse fans, it's great having him back and the screenwriters have made certain that just enough of ""the old stuff"" is included to make the episode realistic and worth watching. It provides us to better know the later, older Morse--and it's exciting to catch the allusions to the later Morse episodes.After this pilot, of course, the younger Morse will ""come of age"" and his character will step outside the obvious references to the older Morse and will stand on his own. Young Morse gets caught up with the crosswords, he's introduced to that red Jag, he takes his first pint, he reveals his love of opera, he comes through full of integrity, but not yet full of himself and his abilities. And he's got a great mentor, Fred Thursday, and even Colin Dexter makes his trademark cameo appearance (watch for it--it's brief!).  Barrington Pheloung, a by word with Morse episodes, is there to set the music.We can now look forward to the series episodes.The Brits certainly know how to make a mystery series.",5,"""Endeavour"" endeavors to supplement the Morse series",1340064000,"06 19, 2012",2012,2096,"['Fans', 'Inspector', 'Morse', 'series', 'can', 'be', 'heartened', 'Endeavour', 'pilot', 'upcoming', 'British', 'series', 'back', 'time', 'reveal', 'young', 'Morse', 'working', 'first', 'real', 'police', 'case', 'giving', 'one', 'more', 'opportunity', 'get', 'know', 'one', 'favorite', 'English', 'detectives.Basically', 'same', 'folks', 'who', ""'ve"", 'given', 'Morse', 'series', 'later', 'very', 'successful', 'very', 'well', 'done', 'Sergeant', 'Lewis', 'series', 'complaints', 'pilot', 'sometimes', 'bit', 'rough', 'edges', 'certainly', 'bit', 'melodramatic', 'ending', 'young', 'Shawn', 'Evans', 'great', 'background', 'understanding', 'inimitable', 'Morse', 'good', 'biographical', 'study', 'only', 'enough', 'give', 'better', 'knowledge', 'what', 'Morse', 'tick.In', 'initial', 'episode', 'young', '15-year-old', 'girl', 'up', 'missing', 'soon', 'up', 'very', 'dead', 'Young', 'Morse', 'assigned', 'case', 'well', 'story', 'there', 'usual', 'Colin', 'Dexterian-like', 'twists', 'turns', 'reversals', 'surprises', 'What', 'not', 'surprising', 'course', 'Morse', 'scene', 'know', 'what', 'expect.For', 'Morse', 'fans', 'great', 'having', 'back', 'screenwriters', 'have', 'made', 'certain', 'just', 'enough', 'old', 'stuff', 'included', 'make', 'episode', 'realistic', 'worth', 'watching', 'better', 'know', 'later', 'older', 'Morse', 'exciting', 'catch', 'allusions', 'later', 'Morse', 'episodes.After', 'pilot', 'course', 'younger', 'Morse', 'will', 'come', 'age', 'character', 'will', 'step', 'obvious', 'references', 'older', 'Morse', 'will', 'stand', 'own', 'Young', 'Morse', 'caught', 'up', 'crosswords', 'introduced', 'red', 'Jag', 'first', 'pint', 'love', 'opera', 'full', 'integrity', 'not', 'yet', 'full', 'abilities', 'got', 'great', 'mentor', 'Fred', 'Thursday', 'even', 'Colin', 'Dexter', 'trademark', 'cameo', 'appearance', 'watch', 'brief', 'Barrington', 'Pheloung', 'word', 'Morse', 'episodes', 'there', 'set', 'music.We', 'can', 'now', 'look', 'forward', 'series', 'episodes.The', 'Brits', 'certainly', 'know', 'how', 'make', 'mystery', 'series']",Endeavour Region 2

Keefer,"[1, 1]","If you are a fan of the Inspector Morse series, and mourned the passing of John Thaw at the young age of 60 who was recently voted by British viewers as #3 in the best 50 actors over the past 50 years, you will be delighted to know that the series is being revived.John Thaw, as the older Morse, is clearly irreplaceable. His brooding, melancholy, curmudgeonly Morse captured the policeman's essence. Thaw's own life paralleled Morse's own with the loss of his mother's constant presence in his life at an early age when she left home and he didn't see her again until he was 19. The character Morse's parents divorced when he was 12, and his mother died three years later. Did this life experience help Thaw to capture the depth and underlying strain of unresolved grief in Morse? Is this why Morse constantly falls for the women in his investigations, even when they turn out to be the culprit?But now enters the new younger Morse in this series Endeavor, which is a prequel to the iconic series. Morse's mother was Quaker which explains the origin of the name. However, the author Colin Dexter, supposedly found the name on a building in which boats were housed along the river Thames in Oxford where he liked to walk. And the names Morse and Lewis actually came from arch-rival cross-word puzzle clue writers whom Dexter knew.Is this new endeavor worthy of the old series? I found it to be so. The younger Morse is a tad gawky, as you imagine Morse probably was in his early days, but his enjoyment of fine cars, classical music, women witnesses, crossword puzzles, literature classics, stubbornness and tenacity is already in evidence. The production values I found to be superior to the old series. The sets for example--the police station, Morse's apartment rental, and even the car repair shop were amazing. The cinematography was original with unusual flashbacks, angles of camera etc.The actors were stand-outs: Endeavor's boss and ""the governor"" or chief of police, the car dealer, the other police supervisors, the suspects, and an old friend of Endeavor's at Oxford. It was an inspired choice to use John Thaw's daughter as a newspaper editor--you could see a bit of her father's face in hers.The crime was appropriately complex, involving a professor at Oxford. So, even though we miss Mr. Thaw, it appears the new actor, Shaun Evans, has the potential to mature into the role of Morse. Loved the morphing of Evan's face into Thaw's face in the rear-view mirror--a dramatic touch.Can't wait for the next episodes of this brilliant and well-done series. We hope it will continue longer than the first incarnation of Colin Dexter's great books, which is probably my favorite mystery series. You can see this first episode on the PBS website until July 31, 2012 at which time you can buy the DVD from Amazon. I hope we'll be able to stream episodes from this series from Amazon as they become available, too, like we can for SHERLOCK!",5,A Worthy Endeavor,1341619200,"07 7, 2012",2012,2945,"['are', 'fan', 'Inspector', 'Morse', 'series', 'mourned', 'passing', 'John', 'Thaw', 'young', 'age', '60', 'who', 'was', 'recently', 'voted', 'British', 'viewers', '3', 'best', '50', 'actors', 'past', '50', 'years', 'will', 'be', 'delighted', 'know', 'series', 'being', 'revived.John', 'Thaw', 'older', 'Morse', 'clearly', 'irreplaceable', 'brooding', 'melancholy', 'curmudgeonly', 'Morse', 'captured', 'policeman', 'essence', 'Thaw', 'own', 'life', 'paralleled', 'Morse', 'own', 'loss', 'mother', 'constant', 'presence', 'life', 'early', 'age', 'when', 'left', 'home', 'did', ""n't"", 'see', 'again', 'was', '19', 'character', 'Morse', 'parents', 'divorced', 'when', 'was', '12', 'mother', 'died', 'three', 'years', 'later', 'Did', 'life', 'experience', 'help', 'Thaw', 'capture', 'depth', 'underlying', 'strain', 'unresolved', 'grief', 'Morse', 'why', 'Morse', 'constantly', 'women', 'investigations', 'even', 'when', 'turn', 'out', 'be', 'culprit', 'now', 'new', 'younger', 'Morse', 'series', 'Endeavor', 'prequel', 'iconic', 'series', 'Morse', 'mother', 'was', 'Quaker', 'origin', 'name', 'However', 'author', 'Colin', 'Dexter', 'supposedly', 'found', 'name', 'building', 'boats', 'were', 'housed', 'river', 'Thames', 'Oxford', 'where', 'liked', 'walk', 'names', 'Morse', 'Lewis', 'actually', 'came', 'arch-rival', 'cross-word', 'puzzle', 'clue', 'writers', 'whom', 'Dexter', 'knew.Is', 'new', 'endeavor', 'worthy', 'old', 'series', 'found', 'be', 'so', 'younger', 'Morse', 'tad', 'gawky', 'imagine', 'Morse', 'probably', 'was', 'early', 'days', 'enjoyment', 'fine', 'cars', 'classical', 'music', 'women', 'witnesses', 'crossword', 'puzzles', 'literature', 'classics', 'stubbornness', 'tenacity', 'already', 'evidence', 'production', 'values', 'found', 'be', 'superior', 'old', 'series', 'sets', 'example', 'police', 'station', 'Morse', 'apartment', 'rental', 'even', 'car', 'repair', 'shop', 'were', 'amazing', 'cinematography', 'was', 'original', 'unusual', 'flashbacks', 'angles', 'camera', 'etc.The', 'actors', 'were', 'stand-outs', 'Endeavor', 'boss', 'governor', 'chief', 'police', 'car', 'dealer', 'other', 'police', 'supervisors', 'suspects', 'old', 'friend', 'Endeavor', 'Oxford', 'was', 'inspired', 'choice', 'use', 'John', 'Thaw', 'daughter', 'newspaper', 'editor', 'could', 'see', 'bit', 'father', 'face', 'hers.The', 'crime', 'was', 'appropriately', 'complex', 'involving', 'professor', 'Oxford', 'So', 'even', 'miss', 'Mr.', 'Thaw', 'new', 'actor', 'Shaun', 'Evans', 'potential', 'mature', 'role', 'Morse', 'Loved', 'morphing', 'Evan', 'face', 'Thaw', 'face', 'rear-view', 'mirror', 'dramatic', 'touch.Ca', ""n't"", 'wait', 'next', 'episodes', 'brilliant', 'well-done', 'series', 'hope', 'will', 'continue', 'longer', 'first', 'incarnation', 'Colin', 'Dexter', 'great', 'books', 'probably', 'favorite', 'mystery', 'series', 'can', 'see', 'first', 'episode', 'PBS', 'website', 'July', '31', '2012', 'time', 'can', 'buy', 'DVD', 'Amazon', 'hope', ""'ll"", 'be', 'able', 'stream', 'episodes', 'series', 'Amazon', 'become', 'available', 'too', 'can', 'SHERLOCK']",Endeavour Region 2

Shaun Evans who plays the young detective constable with the odd first name does an excellent job bringing Morse to life.

It is certainly a story of the same style as the Morse films.  The only flaw is that one tangent involving a high ranking government official has a preposterous, James Bond-ish ending.

""Lewis"" is a sequel. ""Endeavour"" is a prequel that follows Morse in his early days on the Oxford police force, when he was a Detective Constable and still occasionally went by his first name, ""Endeavour"". The year is 1965. The Vietnam War rages in Southeast Asia. The sexual revolution is gaining speed at home. And young Morse (Shaun Evans) is contemplating retirement from the police force already, when he is assigned, along with colleague DC Ian McLeash (Jack Ashton), to do spade work for DI Fred Thursday (Roger Allam) and DS Arthur Lott (Danny Webb).His first case is the disappearance of 15-year-old working class school girl Mary Tremlett (Rachel Heaton). Mary told her parents she was going to the cinema on Saturday afternoon and never returned. Morse finds it odd that she was in possession of several valuable first edition poetry books and that Mary always worked out the first and last clues on the Saturday crosswords published by the Oxford Mail, never the rest of the puzzle. DS Lott resents Morse's education and discourages this obscure line of inquiry. But, when the crosswords turn out to be a clue to a person Mary was secretly meeting, DI Thursday sees Morse's potential and takes the young constable under his wing in an investigation that cuts a trail through an increasing number of Mary's male acquaintances, young and old, with whom she had entanglements that could have been motive for murder.This episode briefly recaptures the tone of the early ""Inspector Morse"" in its opening disconnected scenes. The young Morse is introverted, contemplative, and an opera fan, but he in not yet inured to the job. He's quite squeamish and doesn't drink. The narrative self-consciously leads to Oxford University, which is more characteristic of the later shows than of Colin Dexter's work, if I recall correctly. And it makes an effort to foreshadow the ""Inspector Morse"" series, wisely or not. Colin Dexter, who endorsed this series, makes a cameo appearance, and Abigail Thaw, John Thaw's daughter, has a small role. There are some discontinuities in the plot. For example, the cause of Mary's death seems to be different in different scenes. But the period aspect of the mystery, albeit with some anachronisms, creates added interest, as does the allusion to the Profumo Affair.",4,"Flawed, but with a Strong Cast and Enough Distinction to Recommend It.",1343174400,"07 25, 2012",2012,2471,"['Following', 'success', 'Lewis', 'ITV', 'Masterpiece', 'created', 'spin-off', 'popular', 'Inspector', 'Morse', 'mystery', 'series', 'originally', 'based', 'Colin', 'Dexter', 'novels', 'Lewis', 'sequel', 'Endeavour', 'prequel', 'Morse', 'early', 'days', 'Oxford', 'police', 'force', 'when', 'was', 'Detective', 'Constable', 'still', 'occasionally', 'went', 'first', 'name', 'Endeavour', 'year', '1965', 'Vietnam', 'War', 'Southeast', 'Asia', 'sexual', 'revolution', 'gaining', 'speed', 'home', 'young', 'Morse', 'Shaun', 'Evans', 'contemplating', 'retirement', 'police', 'force', 'already', 'when', 'assigned', 'colleague', 'DC', 'Ian', 'McLeash', 'Jack', 'Ashton', 'do', 'spade', 'work', 'DI', 'Fred', 'Thursday', 'Roger', 'Allam', 'DS', 'Arthur', 'Lott', 'Danny', 'Webb', '.His', 'first', 'case', 'disappearance', '15-year-old', 'working', 'class', 'school', 'girl', 'Mary', 'Tremlett', 'Rachel', 'Heaton', 'Mary', 'told', 'parents', 'was', 'going', 'cinema', 'Saturday', 'afternoon', 'never', 'returned', 'Morse', 'odd', 'was', 'possession', 'several', 'valuable', 'first', 'edition', 'poetry', 'books', 'Mary', 'always', 'worked', 'out', 'first', 'last', 'clues', 'Saturday', 'crosswords', 'published', 'Oxford', 'Mail', 'never', 'rest', 'puzzle', 'DS', 'Lott', 'Morse', 'education', 'obscure', 'line', 'inquiry', 'when', 'crosswords', 'turn', 'out', 'be', 'clue', 'person', 'Mary', 'was', 'secretly', 'meeting', 'DI', 'Thursday', 'Morse', 'potential', 'young', 'constable', 'wing', 'investigation', 'trail', 'increasing', 'number', 'Mary', 'male', 'acquaintances', 'young', 'old', 'whom', 'had', 'entanglements', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'motive', 'murder.This', 'episode', 'briefly', 'tone', 'early', 'Inspector', 'Morse', 'opening', 'disconnected', 'scenes', 'young', 'Morse', 'introverted', 'contemplative', 'opera', 'fan', 'not', 'yet', 'inured', 'job', 'quite', 'squeamish', ""n't"", 'drink', 'narrative', 'self-consciously', 'Oxford', 'University', 'more', 'characteristic', 'later', 'Colin', 'Dexter', 'work', 'recall', 'correctly', 'effort', 'foreshadow', 'Inspector', 'Morse', 'series', 'wisely', 'not', 'Colin', 'Dexter', 'who', 'endorsed', 'series', 'cameo', 'appearance', 'Abigail', 'Thaw', 'John', 'Thaw', 'daughter', 'small', 'role', 'are', 'discontinuities', 'plot', 'example', 'cause', 'Mary', 'death', 'be', 'different', 'different', 'scenes', 'period', 'aspect', 'mystery', 'anachronisms', 'added', 'interest', 'allusion', 'Profumo', 'Affair']",Endeavour Region 2

It was a joy to watch his episodes, and the series continues strong today.In 2012, someone thought to write a show about the young Inspector Morse.  Morse, is an Oxford dropout, returning when he's temporarily assigned to the Oxford branch, taking part in an ongoing investigation surrounding the disappearance of a 15-year-old girl. The old Morse loved Oxford, crossword puzzles and opera. Working by himself, for the most part, he finds clues others have missed. Just like the Morse of old. Detective Inspector Fred Thursday recognizes young Morse's talents, and, others are upset with this newcomer.Shaun Evans plays the young Morse, and what a job well done! I was a little leery at first, but the young Morse grew on me. He had the same qualities we loved in the old Morse. The love of cars, the opera and pretty women.

I've only dabbled, but I am a fan of BBC mystery series because, frankly, they are much more fun and better written than much of the formula mysteries pumped out on American TV.So why pick this mystery? I heard about the Inspector Morse mysteries and thought, why not start at the beginning, even if it is not really the beginning. So I went in with no pre-conceived notions and I was quite taken with the setting and with the characters.A young Morse is thinking of leaving the force when he is swept up into a missing persons case that evolves into a murder investigation, then a suicide, then. . . another twist, another new theory.I liked that I saw a young man who was intelligent, cultured and willing to stick his neck out for the truth despite the opposition from more senior police. Yet, he wasn't just the young gun against the system, but a young man who wasn't as caught up in trying to prove himself as he was in solving the puzzle. Yes, he seemed to care about the victim and he had his own foibles that I'm sure were part of the original series. The mystery was solid, the acting excellent and the potential to make this a series on its own was there, although I have no idea if that was the intent or not. The young Morse is likeable and his initial quandary about leaving the force is clearly answered in the last few minutes as he unravels the mystery.Young Morse becomes emotionally involved in the case, not in a way that compromises his morals or ethics, but in such a way that gives us a glimpse into his character and his background.
