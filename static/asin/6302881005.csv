Demi Moore and Woody Harrelson portray a young, broke but very much in love married couple who decide to try their luck in Vegas. Robert Redford plays a wealthy, smug man who offers the couple 1 million dollars if he can have one night with his wife, she says yes and the couple's relationship is forever tested. This film appears to be provocative but it falls short, I just couldn't get into this film, very boring and calculated.

Woody Harrelson's role.  I do not think he was miscast.  Although he is definitely no match for Robert Redford looks-wise, I think he pulls off the role quite well.  Yes, he's not the perfect man that Robert Redford is, but then again, few men are...  And one does not need to be perfect to be loved.The scene where he has the change of heart is quite touching, he is convincing throughout (the look he gives the tourist who jokes that his wife might not come back?!), and demonstrates enough emotions even without speaking to render the final scene poignant.I also did not find his character lazy or whiny (recession, anyone?), nor do I remember him doing too much cursing...2.  The hippo thing.  I thought it was one of the best things in the movie and one of its few redeeming features.  I loved the line, and I loved the logic behind it: the money gained frivolously could only be spent frivolously (and, in this case, also wonderfully symbolically) to find redemption and forgiveness.I would definitely not go as far as to call this movie a classic, nor do I think that it's particularly mind-blowing (or immoral, for that matter), but it's an entertaining film, with some good chemistry and nice scenes.  Above all, it sets the mood rather well, and if you happen to be in a mood that matches, you'd enjoy the movie at least once.

But now, it's not so bad in ""cheesy"" department. It was more of problematic when it came to ""gas"" department. The first half of the picture wasn't that terrible because that is where the energy was. Then the second half came and sputtered badly like an engine that wouldn't die. That's when I couldn't wait for the end because there was nothing to look for. Just silly, trivial arguments and lots of The Great Gatsby stuff. As matter of fact, when Robert Redford uttered the line, ""He killed somebody once,"" I actually thought he would break out a chain of ""old sport."" Demi Moore was okay, but her part is one of the typical roles where she tries for ""seriousness"" and ""vulnerability"" and fails as usual. Woody Harrelson was...Woody Harrelson. The concept of Indecent Proposal is intriguing as it made me to question the title when it should have been Pretty Decent Proposal. And the rest of the film was a miserable failure. Actually, in the beginning of the picture, Adrian Lyne used the style from 9  Weeks and abandoned it after ten minutes or so. So, that's when I thought the film began to fall apart. I was getting tired of the ten dollar lines from Robert Redford's character, and that also contributed to the demise of Indecent Proposal. Sometimes the unfolding of the story overstretched too far a little bit and became unrealistic. Overall, Indecent Proposal is not that bad of a movie concept-wise but falls apart when it comes to execution. Moreover, Robert Redford's character contained too much semblance of Jay Gatsby, and that part should have been minimized. If that's not possible, get somebody else instead. Lastly, the dialogues needed a lot of work.",2,Stuck in the Middle of Highway with No Gas.,1285200000,"09 23, 2010",2010,1822,"['Viewed', '10/03', '3/08Rate', '33/08', 'First', 'time', 'saw', 'Indecent', 'Proposal', 'October', '2003', 'thought', 'movie', 'was', 'incredibly', 'cheesy', 'gave', '2', 'now', 'not', 'so', 'bad', 'cheesy', 'department', 'was', 'more', 'problematic', 'when', 'came', 'gas', 'department', 'first', 'half', 'picture', 'was', ""n't"", 'terrible', 'where', 'energy', 'was', 'Then', 'second', 'half', 'came', 'sputtered', 'badly', 'engine', 'would', ""n't"", 'die', 'when', 'could', ""n't"", 'wait', 'end', 'was', 'nothing', 'look', 'Just', 'silly', 'trivial', 'arguments', 'lots', 'Great', 'Gatsby', 'stuff', 'matter', 'fact', 'when', 'Robert', 'Redford', 'uttered', 'line', 'killed', 'somebody', 'once', 'actually', 'thought', 'would', 'break', 'out', 'chain', 'old', 'sport', 'Demi', 'Moore', 'was', 'okay', 'part', 'one', 'typical', 'roles', 'where', 'seriousness', 'vulnerability', 'as', 'usual', 'Woody', 'Harrelson', 'was', 'Woody', 'Harrelson', 'concept', 'Indecent', 'Proposal', 'intriguing', 'made', 'question', 'title', 'when', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'Pretty', 'Decent', 'Proposal', 'rest', 'film', 'was', 'miserable', 'failure', 'Actually', 'beginning', 'picture', 'Adrian', 'Lyne', 'used', 'style', '9', 'Weeks', 'abandoned', 'ten', 'minutes', 'so', 'when', 'thought', 'film', 'began', 'fall', 'apart', 'was', 'getting', 'tired', 'ten', 'dollar', 'lines', 'Robert', 'Redford', 'character', 'also', 'contributed', 'demise', 'Indecent', 'Proposal', 'unfolding', 'story', 'overstretched', 'too', 'far', 'little', 'bit', 'became', 'unrealistic', 'Overall', 'Indecent', 'Proposal', 'not', 'bad', 'movie', 'concept-wise', 'apart', 'when', 'execution', 'Moreover', 'Robert', 'Redford', 'character', 'contained', 'too', 'much', 'semblance', 'Jay', 'Gatsby', 'part', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'minimized', 'not', 'possible', 'get', 'somebody', 'else', 'instead', 'Lastly', 'dialogues', 'needed', 'lot', 'work']",N/A

And they do just that. Demi Moore and Woody Harrelson play a loved-up couple who end up taking Robert Redford's offer to sleep with Demi Moore for $1m while they are in Las Vegas, hoping that money will solve their problems. As one watches the film, one hopes that their problems will be solved and that they will live happily ever after. Wrong answer. Accepting his offer causes negative consequences for the couple and just shows that no relationship is unbreakable; cracks appear when you do not expect them to.Pros: Robert Redford!

Everything about him from his attire and and the way he carries himself prove him to be the man who may just be able to tempt Demi Moore or...maybe not?Woody Harrelson plays the poor, genuine and yet tormented male in great style here and after watching this, you will be able to forgive him for Kingpin.How can anyone forget Demi Moore?

The joke is a man asks a woman if she will make love with him for a million dollars.""OK,"" she says.Then he says ""how about five bucks and a candy bar?""""What kind of girl do you think I am,"" milady protests.""We've already established that. Now we're haggling over price.""Rim shot.But seriously, this is another score for director Adrian Lyne. I think this movie is often parodied, but only because it really struck a chord for the viewing public. It has achieved icon status. You could argue that the characters are two dimensional, cardboard cut-outs, but actually, they are fleshed out adequately enough to make this movie work.I like Demi Moore as Real Estate Agent Diana Murphy in this. She is kind of feisty, but then she can also be vulnerable. She made a very convincing Real Estate Agent, too. Woody Harrelson is a little harder to buy as an architect, but he made it work.Robert Redford as the millionaire John Gage was very good. He was sort of Trumpesque, but without the bizarre comb over. This role was similar to when he played The Great Gatsby, but instead of Daisy, he is after Diana, or Demi.When he first makes the Indecent Proposal to David and Diana he brings up an interesting point:---------------------John: Suppose... I were to offer you one million dollars for one night with your wife.David: I'd assume you're kidding.John: Let's pretend I'm not. What would you say?Diana: He'd tell you to go to hell.John: I didn't hear him.David: I'd tell you to go to hell.John: That's a reflex answer because you view the question as hypothetical. But let's say that there was real money backing it up. I'm not kidding. A million dollars. The night would come and go but the money could last a lifetime. Think of it. A million dollars. A lifetime of security... for one night. Don't answer right away. Just consider it; seriously?===============================Indecent Proposal plays the hypothetical game of What If? well, stacking the deck, making it seem like a great deal, making it seem like an easy way out of all of your money problems.But just remember Murphy's Law, David Murphy: Whatever can go wrong, will go wrong.Along with all the great architecture and real estate, look for cameos and supporting roles by Oliver Platt, Billy Bob Thornton, Rip Taylor, and Billy Connolly. Rip Taylor is a scream as Diana Moore's broker. John Gage really shows he has a lot of class when you see the pianist he has hired to serenade Diana. None other than Herbie Hancock!---------------Diana: If you ever want something badly, let it go. If it comes back to you, then it's yours forever.

Yes, it is a stupid plot, because what woman would think twice about being paid to have sex with Robert Redford?,  but it was surprisingly entertaining.  I was shocked that I was able to sit  through the whole thing.  But, Robert Redford did look handsome, so that  helped. I can only recommend this movie to someone that is a Robert Redford  fan, because the movie itself is really not that great, though it does make  you think - would you have sex with a man you didn't know, with the threat  of ruining your marriage, for 1 million dollars?

343799,A2FRKEXDXDN1KI,6302881005,Dennis A. Amith (kndy),"[3, 4]","Author Jack Engelhard wrote a political/romantic and dramatic novel about a Jewish family in hard times and a billionaire Arab who offers a million dollars to sleep with the wife.  A film that delves deep into Arab-Israeli conflict.  The rights for the novel was purchased but the film adaption would be closer to home for the US and changed to relate to American audiences.Directing the film would be Adrian Lyne (""Flash Dance"", ""Fatal Attraction"", ""Jacob's Ladder"" and ""Unfaithful"") and the screenplay for the film was written by Amy Holden Jones (""Beethoven"", ""Mystic Pizza"" and ""The Relic"")  and produced by Sherry Lansing (""Fatal Attraction"", ""The Accused"" and ""Black Rain"").  ""INDECENT PROPOSAL"" was successful at the box office as it brought in over $266 million worldwide despite its negative reviews and even winning the Golden Raspberry Awards for ""Worst Picture"", ""Worst Screenplay"" and ""Worst Supporting Actor"".The film is about David (Woody Harrelson) and Diana Murphy (Demi Moore), a couple that have been in love since they were teenagers and very much in love as adults.  David is an architect and Diana is a real estate agent and for Diana, she wanted David to pursue his dream of building their home near the beach.The couple move forward and have their dream home built but then the market crashed, America was in a recession, Diana was not able to sell any new homes on the market and David lost his job due to budget cuts.  Behind in bills and needing to pay $50,000 on the home they just built, decide to borrow $5,000 and gamble and hope to win money in Las Vegas.On the first night there, they do just that.  David is able to win up to $25,000 and while he gambles, Diana goes through elegant shops at the Hilton and looks at a few dresses and wonders how she would look in one of them.  John Gage (Robert Redford) who sees the young woman is fascinated and offers to buy the dress for her but Diana shoots back that the dress is for sale, not her.As the Murphy's celebrate the night with romantic, passionate love with their money scattered all around them, they start betting it all over again but this time, no results.  David and Diana lose all of their money.While walking through the casino, David sees John Gage and learns that he is a billionaire and bets $10,000 per gold chip when he gambles.  John sees David and Diana so happy but he asks if Diana could join him quick to give his next game good luck. And this time, betting a million dollars.  David roots for his wife and Diana reluctantly goes to John and blows a kiss to the dice and Gage wins.In support of Diana for helping him out, he offers a room at the posh hotel and everything on the house on him.  While checking out the room, Diana gets the black dress she was trying out the day before as a gift and both are invited to a party.While alone, John offers a hypothetical question to David.  If people can be bought for a million dollars.  In this case, what if he offered a million dollars to the couple for one night with his wife.  Both Murphy's say they would tell the person to ""go to hell"".But John is serious.  He makes his offer and tells them for one night with his wife, they would be set for life with a million dollars.During the night, both David and Diana agonize over the situation.  One night, one million dollars and they can eliminate their problems.  So, the two decide to do it.But what are the ramifications to agreeing to such an indecent proposal?VIDEO & AUDIO:""INDECENT PROPOSAL"" gets its first treatment on High Definition with a 1080p transfer on Blu-ray.  First, the good news.  The good news is that certain scenes that incorporate the outdoors and sunlight look great and vibrant.  There are some low-light scenes where blacks are deep and picture quality looks quite nice.  Now, the bad news.  Those scenes are just a few, ""INDECENT PROPOSAL"" has probably one of the worst high grain I have seen on a film on Blu-ray.  There is one scene where Diana is teaching English to a class and the scene is so full of grain that she nearly becomes hard to see at one point.  During the opening scene, with David sitting down near the beach and you see fog all around, high level of grain and color banding.  Not sure if the Las Vegas scenes were stock but those were quite grainy as well. Some scenes looks as if it was muted by digital noise reduction (DNR) and so some scenes look quite soft.Overall, good and bad quality is all over the place.  Some scenes are great but some scenes are absolutely terrible.  The positive factor is that the scenes don't last that long but I don't think I've seen picture quality this uneven for a Blu-ray release.As for audio, the film gets an English 5.1 Dolby TrueHD transfer (French and Spanish 5.1 Dolby Digital).  This film's soundtrack is front channel driven. Dialogue is clear and understandable which is important.  When there is music, John Barry's (""Madagascar"" 1 & 2, ""Chaplin"", ""Peggy Sue Got Married"", ""The Cotton Club"") musical score does come alive and actually, really enjoyed the musical score.  But this is not a film to expect any rear sound or subwoofer usage.The casino scenes which are filled with people and sounds of the casino which I was hoping to hear come alive through my speaker system, was just average.  I was hoping to hear the ambient noises all around me but it seems that everything was front channel driven.  There is a brief scene with the rain pouring down, which sounded quite nice from the front channels but overall, this is a dialogue driven film.Subtitles are featured in English, English SDH, French and Spanish.SPECIAL FEATURES:""INDECENT PROPOSAL"" features commentary by Director Adrian Lyne.  The commentary was done for the 2003 DVD release and Adrian sharing his thoughts on the making of the film, from the love making scenes to how Las Vegas has changed since filming the movie and interesting enough, confesses that there are many things he disliked about the movie but did enjoy the performance of Woody Harrelson and Demi Moore.  But this is a commentary that is filled with long pauses at times.  But Adrian Lyne is a director who is known to tell audiences on his audio commentary that he has a bad memory and will do his best to remember things.  If it was this difficult ten years later, perhaps I'm glad that he didn't do a revised commentary 16 years later.JUDGMENT CALL:""INDECENT PROPOSAL"" was an interested film when released in 1993.  These were the times when ""Lifestyles and the Rich and Famous""  and ""Fresh Prince of Bel-Aire"" was on television, ""Pretty Woman"" was a successful rags-to-riches film, magazines showcasing the glitz of their metropolitan cities,  the glitz of big business were at its high point and people just delved into wanting to know the lifestyles of the rich and people knew the names of the top supermodels of the time.When the film came out, critics felt the notion that the rich would take advantage with those in financial need was preposterous. But compared today where America is in hard economic times, I sometimes wonder if this film would have done better today than in 1993.  Personally, I wouldn't be surprised if these situations happen frequently in the world.  Also, it would have been interesting if the film were adapted today would be an exact adaption focusing on the Arab-Israeli conflict.But if there was one fault of the film, was this portrayal of a perfect couple hitting hard financial times and the character of David just going a little overboard that his wife had sex with another man.  Afterall, he did agree to it but then he decided not to and it's too late.  Share some of the blame, it was a joint decision and why he takes everything out all on her is just a bit too much.I felt that Demi Moore was just enjoyable to watch and she did a wonderful job with her character.  Robert Redford was absolutely suave and for Woody Harrelson, at the time, it showed us that the actor had more to give than what we saw of him on the television show ""Cheers"".If anything, I was a bit put off by the uneven picture quality of this film.  Some scenes were just downright ugly and makes me want to go back to the DVD to see if it was that bad or the Blu-ray 1080p HD Transfer just elevated the grain.  ""INDECENT PROPOSAL"" was not the prettiest transfer I was hoping to see on Blu-ray and the lack of any special features but a commentary was a bit disappointing.In the end, I did enjoy the film and considering the time the film was released.  Was it really preposterous for a financially strapped couple to accept such an indecent proposal?  Especially compared to another popular film where a multi-millionaire would hire a prostitute to be with him for a week?  Probably not.Overall, ""INDECENT PROPOSAL"" was an enjoyable film that probably makes better sense now that the country is in an economic recession and people watching it again will probably find how powerful of a film it is now than what it was back in 1993.",3,Blu-ray: Nothing added from the DVD version and picture quality is a mix bag during certain scenes,1244678400,"06 11,

That wasn't the case with Indecent Proposal.Sure, the plot became the favorite punchline of every comedian - professional and amateur - in the country but it also managed to stir up discussion among the fiscally conservative (meaning broke) portion of the population: Would you have a one-night stand with a wealthy person, or anyone who was offering you money, in order to make ends meet?

343802,A18CA0GRHDVP8X,6302881005,Earl Hazell,"[4, 7]","INDECENT PROPOSAL, along with THE DEVIL'S ADVOCATE (Al Pacino and Keanu Reeves) are two of the most entertaining morality plays out there.  The  moral to the story, without needing to go into Christian theology or  anything else is really simple: there's no such thing as a free lunch.  I  remember when the movie was out in the theatres and the many sound bite  talk show people would ask guests and people on the street if they would do  what the couple Demi Moore and Woody Harrelson did in the film; so many  fools said &quot;yes, in a heartbeat&quot; and I wondered about the  education system of our country!  The line of the stylish Robert Redford  when Demi Moore accused him (while slowly being seduced by him) of being a  man &quot;who likes to own things&quot; summed up the whole movie:  &quot;You think I need to BUY women?&quot;  Redford, a man in this movie  who as a billionaire has seen and caused the birth and death of  multi-national corporations the size of ancient civilizations, knew EXACTLY  what would happen to their marriage, and to their mind- and to her heart,  if they knowingly accepted this proposal most indecent. He depended on  THEIR arrogance and scoffing at the fragile nature of human relationships  and the invisible architecture of the human soul; knowing, like every man  (and woman) with a secret plan for another human being, that that would  bring about the predictable but unexpected chain of outer events.  The  movie's most poignant turn, however, is when he reveals the road not taken  in HIS life, with all his billions, and how that has generated much of his  actions.  Only then do we really discover under no uncertain terms what he  wants, and what he is willing to do to get it.  That really begins the  falling domino of epiphanies that leads to the revealing of the gentle,  fragile and beautiful hearts of all three of the characters, and the  transcendent power of love, committment and surrender.It's a good  guy/girl movie as well, because Woody Harrelson is so much the All-American  man, full of rambunctious flaws and money problems (can't relate), where  Robert Redford is, well, Robert Redford; he is the next best thing to Sean  Connery's James Bond in this movie when it comes to the debonair, power-  broker man the women couldn't resist if he had a 30k a year job, let alone  making 30k every couple of hours.  The testosterone is there.  Combine  that with the transformation of both of their characters because of the  love of Demi Moore, who can play the dichotomous strong/weak women better  than most of the Hollywood actresses out there still (if she would just  take better scripts- aren't the bills paid sweetie?), and you've got more  intelligent INNER action, romance and sympathy than you can shake a stick  at.Worth owning.  Ignore some of it's flaws (too miniscule to mention  really; if you want CASABLANCA than buy that for Gawd sakes) and you'll  have a great time with it- perhaps even learn something about yourself that  you didn't know you knew.",3,One of the most entertaining morality plays,966556800,"08 18, 2000",2000,3034,"['INDECENT', 'PROPOSAL', 'THE', 'DEVIL', 'ADVOCATE', 'Al', 'Pacino', 'Keanu', 'Reeves', 'are', 'two', 'most', 'entertaining', 'morality', 'out', 'there', 'moral', 'story', 'needing', 'go', 'Christian', 'theology', 'anything', 'else', 'really', 'simple', 'such', 'thing', 'free', 'lunch', 'remember', 'when', 'movie', 'was', 'out', 'theatres', 'many', 'sound', 'bite', 'talk', 'show', 'people', 'would', 'ask', 'guests', 'people', 'street', 'would', 'do', 'what', 'couple', 'Demi', 'Moore', 'Woody', 'Harrelson', 'did', 'film', 'so', 'many', 'fools', 'said', 'quot', 'yes', 'heartbeat', 'quot', 'wondered', 'education', 'system', 'country', 'line', 'stylish', 'Robert', 'Redford', 'when', 'Demi', 'Moore', 'accused', 'slowly', 'being', 'seduced', 'being', 'man', 'quot', 'who', 'own', 'things', 'quot', 'summed', 'whole', 'movie', 'quot', 'think', 'need', 'BUY', 'women', 'quot', 'Redford', 'man', 'movie', 'who', 'billionaire', 'seen', 'caused', 'birth', 'death', 'multi-national', 'corporations', 'size', 'ancient', 'civilizations', 'knew', 'EXACTLY', 'what', 'would', 'happen', 'marriage', 'mind-', 'heart', 'knowingly', 'accepted', 'proposal', 'most', 'indecent', 'depended', 'THEIR', 'arrogance', 'scoffing', 'fragile', 'nature', 'human', 'relationships', 'invisible', 'architecture', 'human', 'soul', 'knowing', 'man', 'woman', 'secret', 'plan', 'human', 'being', 'would', 'bring', 'predictable', 'unexpected', 'chain', 'outer', 'events', 'movie', 'most', 'poignant', 'turn', 'however', 'when', 'road', 'not', 'taken', 'HIS', 'life', 'billions', 'how', 'generated', 'much', 'actions', 'Only', 'then', 'do', 'really', 'discover', 'uncertain', 'terms', 'what', 'what', 'willing', 'do', 'get', 'really', 'falling', 'domino', 'epiphanies', 'revealing', 'gentle', 'fragile', 'beautiful', 'hearts', 'three', 'characters', 'transcendent', 'power', 'love', 'committment', 'surrender.It', 'good', 'guy/girl', 'movie', 'as', 'well', 'Woody', 'Harrelson', 'so', 'much', 'All-American', 'man', 'full', 'rambunctious', 'flaws', 'money', 'problems', 'ca', ""n't"", 'relate', 'where', 'Robert', 'Redford', 'well', 'Robert', 'Redford', 'next', 'best', 'thing', 'Sean', 'Connery', 'James', 'Bond', 'movie', 'when', 'debonair', 'power-', 'broker', 'man', 'women', 'could', ""n't"", 'resist', 'had', '30k', 'year', 'job', 'let', 'alone', 'making', '30k', 'couple', 'hours', 'testosterone', 'there', 'Combine', 'transformation', 'characters', 'love', 'Demi', 'Moore', 'who', 'can', 'play', 'dichotomous', 'strong/weak', 'women', 'better', 'most', 'Hollywood', 'out', 'there', 'still', 'would', 'just', 'take', 'better', 'scripts-', 'are', ""n't"", 'bills', 'paid', 'sweetie', ""'ve"", 'got', 'more', 'intelligent', 'INNER', 'action', 'romance', 'sympathy', 'can', 'shake', 'stick', 'at.Worth', 'owning', 'Ignore', 'flaws', 'too', 'miniscule', 'mention', 'really', 'want', 'CASABLANCA', 'buy', 'Gawd', 'sakes', ""'ll"", 'have', 'great', 'time', 'it-', 'perhaps', 'even', 'learn', 'something', 'did', ""n't"", 'know', 'knew']",N/A

There are few who could have played that role with such perfect pitch poise and detachment with utter taste and sensability.

Why does he release her so easily if she is so special?  In this sense his role is entirely symbolic as the $question $mark.Viewers note this film is all about bribery and nothing to do with prostitution.The proposal is a very provocative question. It seems a sure answer among people you know but not among people you don't. Certainly a big  box-office puller. The spectrum of response is quite wide between the moral, the cynical and the greedy. An exploration on the ironys  involved would have made for an intriguing film. Clearly BECAUSE this is a big box office film if it has Demi Moore and Redford in it,  then it must go on its knees to the concensus of public opinion in piety to the most moral. There was a taboo on the screen-play from the outset that strangled this film when hypocricy and contradictions could have had a field day.This was evident as soon as the violins starting playing at the beginning that her chump would win the day.

It was a highly improbable fantasy-type movie that couldn't possibly happen, if you stop to think about it. So don't stop and think about it. Just relax and enjoy a rather good story. Harrelson and Moore played a happily married couple who were working on their own little dream castle property. When a steep recession came along, they both lost their jobs, their project came to a halt and the property went into default. In short, their financial socks were shrinking down into their shoes. In a last-minute effort, they took the remaining $5,000 they had and went to Las Vegas to see if they could run it up to what they needed (about $50,000). Well, you know how that goes. The first night they ran it up to $30,000, but dropped back down the following night. In the meantime, Moore accidentally met Redford, who played a dashing Las Vegas billionaire. He thought nothing of dropping millions of dollars on the gambling tables, but that's because he had billions. It's then that he made an indecent proposal. He'll give her a million dollars for a night's ""entertainment.""The couple reacted with a resounding ""No!"" to the proposal, as you might expect. But then they thought it over. A million dollars would fix all their financial problems for the rest of their lives. After some discussion, they decided to go through with the offer. That's when the agony set in. A gulf quickly developed between the married couple and became wider and wider. Furthermore, Redford enjoyed the evening enough that he turned into something of a well-heeled stalker. And then the real agony set in.It's an interesting premise, albeit a complete fantasy. It's quite emotion grabbing, however. It will hold your attention. The movie is well done and well presented.

Then comes the bachelor billionaire Robert Redford and pay them $1000,000 for ONE NIGHT with Demi Moore, Oh because she said SHE COULDN'T BE BOUGHT!!!Of course it was INDECENT and IMMORAL but the broke couple thought it would solve their financial problem! Well, yes it did but it ruined their marriage. Woody Harrelson became very suspicious about his wife, Robert Redford put them on fire and Demi Moore tried to maintain her marriage but ... a broken glass can never be the same again!Robert Redford wins Demi Moore's heart and she files for divorce. Of course she lived like a queen; a Palace, a Rolls Royce and Robert Redford. But something is missing in their relationship...I find this film to be very romantic, touchy and POWERFUL. One of the best words said in the movie was:1. of Woody Harrelson: &quot;I was very jealous of him because I always saw him as a better man but now I know he's only a man with more money!&quot;2. of Robert Redford: &quot;She never looked at me the way she looked at him!&quot;ONE OF A KIND, VERY ROMANTIC, VERY TOUCHY, in a world where there is no winner!",5,M I L L I O N S GATEWAY!,989884800,"05 15, 2001",2001,1397,"['First', 'get', 'misunderstood', 'yes', 'proposal', 'INDECENT', 'far', 'away', 'human', 'Moralities', 'manage', 'put', 'aside', ""'ll"", 'LOVE', 'movie.I', 'find', 'be', 'best', 'movie', 'Demi', 'Moore', 'so', 'sweet', 'sexy', 'married', 'Woody', 'Harrelson', 'extremely', 'broke', 'big', 'debt', 'Then', 'bachelor', 'billionaire', 'Robert', 'Redford', 'pay', '1000,000', 'ONE', 'NIGHT', 'Demi', 'Moore', 'Oh', 'said', 'SHE', 'COULD', ""N'T"", 'BE', 'BOUGHT', 'course', 'was', 'INDECENT', 'IMMORAL', 'broke', 'couple', 'thought', 'would', 'solve', 'financial', 'problem', 'Well', 'yes', 'did', 'ruined', 'marriage', 'Woody', 'Harrelson', 'became', 'very', 'suspicious', 'wife', 'Robert', 'Redford', 'put', 'fire', 'Demi', 'Moore', 'tried', 'maintain', 'marriage', 'broken', 'glass', 'can', 'never', 'be', 'same', 'again', 'Robert', 'Redford', 'Demi', 'Moore', 'heart', 'divorce', 'course', 'lived', 'queen', 'Palace', 'Rolls', 'Royce', 'Robert', 'Redford', 'something', 'missing', 'relationship', 'find', 'film', 'be', 'very', 'romantic', 'touchy', 'POWERFUL', 'One', 'best', 'words', 'said', 'movie', 'was:1.', 'Woody', 'Harrelson', 'quot', 'was', 'very', 'jealous', 'always', 'saw', 'better', 'man', 'now', 'know', 'only', 'man', 'more', 'money', 'quot', '2.', 'Robert', 'Redford', 'quot', 'never', 'looked', 'way', 'looked', 'quot', 'ONE', 'A', 'KIND', 'VERY', 'ROMANTIC', 'VERY', 'TOUCHY', 'world', 'where', 'winner']",N/A
343812,A16CZRQL23NOIW,6302881005,Hiram Gomez Pardo,"[2, 5]","The spirit of the tragedy has been slow but progressively demolished and even confiscated since the XVII Century. Since these ages, the tragedy has suffered a visible process of perverse distortion, becoming just a moral lesson to follow. Jean Anouilh, Jean Paul Sartre, Joyce, Selma Lagerloff, Albert Camus, Fedor Dostoievsky,  Eugene O Neill, Giovanni Papini, Ionesco, Beckett, William Faulkner, Ernst Hemingway, August Strindberg and Henrik Ibsen  are weird exceptions, but in general terms, the cathartic experience derived from the tragic ethos, has vanished.So, if you dissect the tragedy into fragments of moral lessons, you just are telling a fable, but nothing else. You simply have frozen the wrath of Gods into hermeneutic pills, in order to satisfy the great audiences and so guarantee them, a final return to their respective homes. But the soul has not suffered the expected shock, and the spirit has not experienced the sharpness of the contrasts: long life to triviality.  In the tragedy there are not good guys or bad guys; there' s no one absolutely innocent; the tragedy is the violation and transgression of a rule related with the cosmic order. It's impossible to understand in its wholeness, the force of its significance if you do not look it under the mythic coordinates.The film starts with an interesting dilemma to solve what if?. The corrosive and nasty feature represented by Redford , may be considered as the Devil' s embodiment. The proposal was made and accepted. But once the dramatic peak has been reached, one can feel how the film precipitates obstreperously, the expected reactions fall in a well know stereotyped cliche; she cries and is in shame; he looks arrogant but then the character becomes a marionette.A false redemption works out as the final launch, that will allow them to understand one each other and the forgiveness will hover about them.This material really did not deserve such predictable final. In hands of Robert van Akeren (The woman in flames), for instance the result would have been absolutely different; there is a lot of self indulgence not only for the characters and the audience in general.",3,A good start that stranded in the middle of the storm!,1149638400,"06 7, 2006",2006,2157,"['spirit', 'tragedy', 'been', 'slow', 'progressively', 'demolished', 'even', 'confiscated', 'XVII', 'Century', 'ages', 'tragedy', 'suffered', 'visible', 'process', 'perverse', 'distortion', 'becoming', 'just', 'moral', 'lesson', 'follow', 'Jean', 'Anouilh', 'Jean', 'Paul', 'Sartre', 'Joyce', 'Selma', 'Lagerloff', 'Albert', 'Camus', 'Fedor', 'Dostoievsky', 'Eugene', 'O', 'Neill', 'Giovanni', 'Papini', 'Ionesco', 'Beckett', 'William', 'Faulkner', 'Ernst', 'Hemingway', 'August', 'Strindberg', 'Henrik', 'Ibsen', 'are', 'weird', 'exceptions', 'general', 'terms', 'cathartic', 'experience', 'derived', 'tragic', 'ethos', 'vanished.So', 'dissect', 'tragedy', 'fragments', 'moral', 'lessons', 'just', 'are', 'telling', 'fable', 'nothing', 'else', 'simply', 'have', 'frozen', 'wrath', 'Gods', 'hermeneutic', 'pills', 'order', 'satisfy', 'great', 'audiences', 'so', 'guarantee', 'final', 'return', 'respective', 'homes', 'soul', 'not', 'suffered', 'expected', 'shock', 'spirit', 'not', 'experienced', 'sharpness', 'contrasts', 'long', 'life', 'triviality', 'tragedy', 'are', 'not', 'good', 'guys', 'bad', 'guys', 's', 'one', 'absolutely', 'innocent', 'tragedy', 'violation', 'transgression', 'rule', 'related', 'cosmic', 'order', 'impossible', 'understand', 'wholeness', 'force', 'significance', 'do', 'not', 'look', 'mythic', 'coordinates.The', 'film', 'interesting', 'dilemma', 'solve', 'what', 'corrosive', 'nasty', 'feature', 'represented', 'Redford', 'may', 'be', 'considered', 'Devil', 's', 'embodiment', 'proposal', 'was', 'made', 'accepted', 'once', 'dramatic', 'peak', 'been', 'reached', 'one', 'can', 'feel', 'how', 'film', 'obstreperously', 'expected', 'reactions', 'fall', 'well', 'know', 'stereotyped', 'cliche', 'cries', 'shame', 'arrogant', 'then', 'character', 'marionette.A', 'false', 'redemption', 'out', 'final', 'launch', 'will', 'allow', 'understand', 'one', 'other', 'forgiveness', 'will', 'hover', 'them.This', 'material', 'really', 'did', 'not', 'deserve', 'such', 'predictable', 'final', 'hands', 'Robert', 'van', 'Akeren', 'woman', 'flames', 'instance', 'result', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'absolutely', 'different', 'lot', 'self', 'indulgence', 'not', 'only', 'characters', 'audience', 'general']",N/A

Demi Moore never really loved the billionare and although yes he succeeded in seducing her and she did 'love' him more as a friend than anything else it becomes pretty apparent that she never trully loved the billionare. She diffenately begins to realize this near the end. Some people think that she just felt guilt over what she was doing to her husband but sorry that's not all it was. She loved her husband beyond what she could ever feel for the billionare no matter how much money he had.The main theme of this movie I think that many people over look is that money for all it can buy can never buy happiness. Someone wrote a review saying that their was no way that the husband could never compete with the billionare for her love.

Even at the tender age of ten, I recognized the inherent sexual power and enticement in the single image of Robert Redford leaning over a pool table and offering a man $1 million for a night with his wife.  Back then, I was desperate to see how the story ended, but my mother didn't let me go to movies like that.Fast-forward fifteen years to the time when I finally got around to watching the movie.  I don't know what took me so long, but in a way I wish I hadn't waited, because if I had seen the movie when I was a kid, I would have appreciated it a lot more.  Back then, I wasn't so picky.  Back then I didn't notice wooden dialogue that sounded like it came out of a Harlequin romance novel, or stilted, shallow acting.  I didn't notice gaping holes in the plot, such as the fact that the couple kept referring to their million dollars even AFTER they paid their lawyer 5% and the point had been belabored again and again that they didn't have $50,000.00 in their own money to bring the figure back up to a cool mil.  Back then I wasn't as discerning about screenplays and didn't tend to notice when one was poorly or inadequately written.  I never would have noticed the soft focus and lighting designed to keep Robert Redford looking younger than his 57 years, and the lazy soundtrack and tepid score wouldn't have come to my attention at all.  And of course predicting the ending was tougher for me back then, so I wouldn't have seen every ""twist"" in the plot coming from a mile away.Well as they say, that was then and this is now.  Obviously I noticed ALL of these things and they failed to impress me.  I found the entire thing forgettable.

This Adrian Lyne directed/Sherry Lansing adapted freely from the John Engelhard novel vacillates from insipid melodrama to thriller to moralistic rhetoric and so on.The film starts with a silly guffaw and end with a tearful,hand-holding whimper that suggests of LOVE STORY'S Ali McGraw and Ryan O'Neill stating ""Love means never having to say you're sorry.""The idea that comes from Englehard's novel is indeed novel:Would you be willing to, for one evening, ""sell yourself"" for a million dollars and be able to wipe your mind of the deed the morning after? In this case, the decision involves a couple (Woody Harrelson and Demi Moore),married and very much in love, who are deeply in debt,who are offered the ""way out"" by agreeing mutually to have her spend one night with the rich John Gage (Robert Redford). The moral and psychological grounds that the novel and film tread are interesting ones that do cause honest pause for reflection for even the most sanctimonious of people.The questions are begged,""Can the money be taken,can you feel good about it, and can you go on unchanged?"".These are all really great and compelling questions and this is the foundation upon which this film is built.The problem though is that the film never truly commits itself totally to these questions and the destructive results that follow.The film plods terribly for the first hour only to reach some measure of tension and then release with a sigh that leaves for total dissatisfaction with the entire project.Lyne and Lansing brought to the screen FATAL ATTRACTION that nearly had everyone checking their elevators and stove-tops! This film approaches none of the drama and tension that FATAL ATTRACTION had.Still, the interesting concepts are there, but the credit for that must go to the novelist who first penned the idea.Lyne does little to nothing with it.The acting is pretty stiff and the dialogue is full of so many cliche lines that it becomes an exercise in triviality.The John Barry soundtrack is....well what can one say but...John Barry;slow,based on the same four chords in the exact same sequence that all his scores contain.One viewing will suffice with significant fast forwards through meaningless bedroom scenes .",3,"""Money Can't Buy Me Love...""",1190592000,"09 24, 2007",2007,2332,"['ever', 'song', 'came', 'mind', 'suited', 'film', 'so', 'aptly', 'would', 'be', 'Beatles', 'Money', 'Ca', ""n't"", 'Buy', 'Me', 'Love', 'Adrian', 'Lyne', 'directed/Sherry', 'Lansing', 'adapted', 'freely', 'John', 'Engelhard', 'novel', 'vacillates', 'insipid', 'melodrama', 'thriller', 'moralistic', 'rhetoric', 'so', 'on.The', 'film', 'silly', 'guffaw', 'end', 'tearful', 'hand-holding', 'whimper', 'LOVE', 'STORY', 'Ali', 'McGraw', 'Ryan', ""O'Neill"", 'stating', 'Love', 'never', 'having', 'say', ""'re"", 'sorry', 'idea', 'Englehard', 'novel', 'indeed', 'novel', 'Would', 'be', 'willing', 'one', 'evening', 'sell', 'million', 'dollars', 'be', 'able', 'wipe', 'mind', 'deed', 'morning', 'case', 'decision', 'couple', 'Woody', 'Harrelson', 'Demi', 'Moore', 'married', 'very', 'much', 'love', 'who', 'are', 'deeply', 'debt', 'who', 'are', 'offered', 'way', 'agreeing', 'mutually', 'have', 'spend', 'one', 'night', 'rich', 'John', 'Gage', 'Robert', 'Redford', 'moral', 'psychological', 'grounds', 'novel', 'film', 'tread', 'are', 'interesting', 'ones', 'do', 'cause', 'honest', 'pause', 'reflection', 'even', 'most', 'sanctimonious', 'people.The', 'questions', 'are', 'begged', 'Can', 'money', 'be', 'taken', 'can', 'feel', 'good', 'can', 'go', 'unchanged', '.These', 'are', 'really', 'great', 'compelling', 'questions', 'foundation', 'film', 'built.The', 'problem', 'though', 'film', 'never', 'truly', 'totally', 'questions', 'destructive', 'results', 'follow.The', 'film', 'plods', 'terribly', 'first', 'hour', 'only', 'reach', 'measure', 'tension', 'then', 'release', 'sigh', 'total', 'dissatisfaction', 'entire', 'project.Lyne', 'Lansing', 'brought', 'screen', 'FATAL', 'ATTRACTION', 'nearly', 'had', 'everyone', 'checking', 'elevators', 'stove-tops', 'film', 'none', 'drama', 'tension', 'FATAL', 'ATTRACTION', 'had.Still', 'interesting', 'concepts', 'are', 'there', 'credit', 'must', 'go', 'novelist', 'who', 'first', 'penned', 'idea.Lyne', 'little', 'nothing', 'it.The', 'acting', 'pretty', 'stiff', 'dialogue', 'full', 'so', 'many', 'cliche', 'lines', 'exercise', 'triviality.The', 'John', 'Barry', 'soundtrack', '.well', 'what', 'can', 'one', 'say', 'John', 'Barry', 'slow', 'based', 'same', 'four', 'chords', 'exact', 'same', 'sequence', 'scores', 'contain.One', 'viewing', 'will', 'suffice', 'significant', 'fast', 'forwards', 'meaningless', 'bedroom', 'scenes']",N/A

Here we have a successful young couple played by Woody Harrelson as an up-and-coming architect and a never more splendid Demi Moore who is a high end real estate agent.When David (Harrelson) loses his job, their dream house is put in jeopardy, so they head for Vegas to win some money.  Uh huh.  There, Diana (Moore) is spotted by a suave billionaire (Robert Redford).  After meeting at the craps table, John Gage (Redford) invites them to a party in his penthouse suite.  John makes the offer and the fun begins.  Realizing how much the money would help them with their dream, they eventually agree.  One proviso.  They would never talk about it again.  Uh huh.Wracked with guilt and jealousy David presses to the point he drives Diana away.  Where does she go?  Well Gage is no fat old billionaire.  He is good looking and wears impeccable clothes.  He is sophisticated, romantic...and well he knows how to treat a lady.  And he wants her.  The biggest problem with the movie isn't the premise, it's the casting of Woody Harrelson in the young hubby role.  For the life of me I can't figure out what Diana sees in the lout.  Harrelson just can't pull it off and his over the top rants don't help.The film also kind of lumbers along with lots of sex talk but the action is all off screen.  We're not really sure what Diana and John did that night.  For all we know, they just talked.  Oh, and what happens to the $1 million?  Beyond stupid.  Still I give the movie a mild recommendation because of the provocative theme and beautiful people all in some beautiful sets.

It's just like two best friends saying ""we can sleep together and still be best friends and not ruin the friendship"" It's naive. And this movie is more complicated than that, and it's about a wealthy businessman (Robert Redford) who makes an INDECENT PROPOSAL to a young poor couple (Woody Harrelson and Demi Moore) and it's an offer of one million dollars for one night with David's (Harrelson) wife (Moore) It's amazing what rich people do with their money, and even more so it's amazing what poor people will do for money. In this case, the couple believes they have it all figured out, no feelings, no mind no heart just her body, just sex, for the money they need for their future that could last a lifetime. And the saddest part is when David actually wakes up, and realized he made a terrible mistake and runs all over the hotel looking for her, and then off she goes in a helicopter with Mr. Wonderful. Right then and there you know what's going to happen later on. Bitter feelings, jealousy, guilt, and hating her for doing it when it's himself who he hates more for actually letting her do it. No man should ever sell his wife, for one night, for one minute it just isn't right even for all the money in the world if you love her, never let someone try to steal her for cash. It's sleezy no matter how you look at it. Demi Moore is absolutely gorgeous in this film. And there was excellent acting by her and woody, and this is a very romantic movie. A little sad here and there but a nice message about what money can do. They say money has power over people, it's evil, and greed will always get you the short end of the stick no matter what.

It struck me as silly then and I didn't watch it.  But one rainy night when I had nothing better to do I watched it on Netflix.  I still thought the idea was ridiculous and shut it off before she made up her mind.  However Redford was so attractive that I went back the following night just to see what would happen and his charm kept me watching to the end.  I actually liked the whole cast.  Woody Harrelson is likable as the impulsive, idealistic, young guy.  Demi Moore does a good job as the pretty young wife.  And Redford, in his white suit looked like he just stepped out of Gatsby.  Who could resist him?The story is taken from a novel in which the millionaire is an Arab shiek which would be a whole different proposition. I haven't read it so I can't comment but it's interesting to speculate on how it played out there.  The film has a lot of logical holes in it.  First, someone as charming, good-looking, and ultimately nice, not to mention Rich, as the Redford character is, would not have to offer any money to any woman.  Secondly although Demi Moore looked good she's neither beautiful nor interesting enough to justify Redford looking for her. And one would wonder how, after RR she'd really want to back to Woody.  Because he paid a million dollars for a hippo?Finally where the film fails is that it sets up the moral premise--that love is more important than money and that love cannot be bought.  It sets up the Woody character as representing Love and the Redford character as representing Money.  That's all very good but the story doesn't unfold that way.  The Redford character seems to be as genuinely in love with the woman  as Woody  -- even more so, given his heroic act at the end.  The scenes in which he is pursuing her---in the classroom and in his home, are the most genuinely touching of the whole film. Their dance on the patio of his home is much more romantic than all of the scenes with Woody and Demi in the sheets.  It is possible that Woody is the better man for her but the film doesn't show that.And probably most importantly, which Redford pointed out was that he would not have let his wife be sold as Woody did.  So the film doesn't prove its own stated premise.

You know the story: desperate couple runs into a problem with finances, so they go to Las Vegas to try to make some quick cash. In the midst of this, they run into a billionaire, who has his sets on the wife, and offers the couple one million big ones for a night with the lady. It should be noted that the couple went into this thinking (or at least hoping) that the whole thing would mean nothing afterwards, and it would be a walk in the park--in other words, easy money.

343837,A38S8RD8XOXLVS,6302881005,"SHAWN JAMES ""Amateur Film critic""","[0, 3]","Indecent Proposal's intriguing premise starts off with a provocative question: ""What would you do if I offered you a million dollars to spend the night with your wife?"" In its attempt to explore sexuality, morals and ethics in America, the movie's writers, producers, and director are too afraid of the controversial subject matter to provide a clear answer to the question it asks the audience. Instead of being thought provoking film, the movie deteriorates into another predictable by the numbers forgettable commercial Hollywood drama. If the studios gave me million dollars I could make a better film than this.Indecent Proposal follows a struggling California married couple drowning$50,000 in debt. Out of work and desperate for cash, they go on a trip to Vegas. Browsing in a hotel store, Diana runs into a Billionaire John Gage who has eyes on her. He offers to buy her a $5000 dress she has eyes on. Diana says she can't be bought. Gage sees a challenge. Shawn sees a predictable plot twist.Thinking nothing of her encounter she returns to the gambling tables with her husband. After winning $25,000, Halfway towards their goal, the couple heads back to their room planning to gamble more unaware of how Hollywood casinos operate. Predictably they lose all their winnings. Both run into Gage who asks Diana to go to his table for luck. Gage plays a high stakes game betting a million dollars on a crap table. After winning his high stakes bet, Gage asks the couple to join him in his suite. There he proposes his indecent proposal: A night with the wife in exchange for a million dollars. The cash-strapped couple declines, but ponders taking him up on his offer on the way back to the hotel room. Set your watch for what happens next.Soon after the proposal the movie falls apart. Gage buys her the expensive dress sweetens the pot. Upon getting the dress the couple decides takes up Gage on his offer. With his wife on the way, Woody hangs out with a lawyer buddy. Soon after talking to him, Harrelson's character gets second thoughts. He races for the roof to cancel the deal but is too late to stop the helicopter. How predictable.On the boat we watch Diana getting ready. She and Gage meet up and have dinner and drinks. We don't know if they have relations; the movie leaves that as a mystery. Diana and her husband return to California to pay their debts. They soon find out John Gage has bought out their mortgage. Things start to get ridiculous from here. The manipulative Gage only bought the house as part of a tactic to possess Diana. He goes to her real estate job and tries to court her. I guess one night of her good stuff wasn't good enough for her. Harrelson's character starts to become insecure, wanting graphic details of the encounter. His jealousies cause him to act irrational and angry like every other movie husband. Feeling stressed out, Diana leaves her husband for the super rich Gage. Yawn.Losing his woman, Harrelson takes a teaching job and starts working on his future. Getting the divorce papers, he goes to an auction for animals. There he spends the one million dollars on a hippo to prove how much he loves her. He signs the divorce papers and she goes off with her billionaire man. He gets a change of heart when he realizes she still loves him. Yawn.Later in the car, Gage and his driver talk about how they've played this game over a dozen times. Diana requests he stop the car. They break up and she gets on a bus. Later she meets her ex-husband at the pier he proposed to her at and the movie comes to a clunky unsatisfying close.The performances are terrible. The entire cast is uninspired; no one in this film makes an effort to bring any type of depth to their characters. Woody Harrelson is horribly miscast. I don't believe him as an architecture expert. Demi Moore is wooden in the role of Diana. She brings no dimension to the character at all. I feel no tension or stress from her even though she's playing a woman conflicted by tremendous emotional and moral pressures. Robert Redford is charming and handsome, as John Gage but the character seems like a one-dimensional caricature instead of a human being. Look for Billy Bob Thornton in a small role as a tourist.Indecent Proposal isn't indecent it's just bland. It doesn't take any of the risks in its exploration of its taboo subject matter. Aside from some lukewarm sex scenes early on between the married couple, the movie is just another by the numbers Hollywood drama pretending to be a thought provoking film. The provocative ideas about sexual morals and ethics advertised in its premise are just a selling point to trick customers into spending money on it. Don't let this movie con you out of your hard earned cash. Instead of accepting this mediocre proposal on the video rack, I suggest you pick up Summer of '42, When Harry Met Sally or Love Story.",1,Nothing Indecent about this dull movie.

I think this film raises questions that may be tough for some to answer, as in ""Would I ever let my husband/wife sleep with anyone for ANY amount of money whatsoever?"" My answer is simply: OF COURSE NOT. You'd have to be pretty dumb, desperate, and morally corrupt to even consider it. I can see now why this film was so controversial when it was released. It was a good movie, though, and it portrays the consequences that those certain kinds of decisions can bring. The leads were very good in their roles. I was not disappointed.

343840,A359IT81FBX64Y,6302881005,Steven Mason,"[3, 4]","This movie came out 15 years ago, and I wasn't impressed back then, even less so now. So why did I watch it again? Because my sister and I had different memories about how it ended. My sister was right, but she's wrong about it being a good movie! But then, she pretty much likes anything with Demi Moore in it. Go figure! The movie is loosely based on the novel by Jack Engelhard.There are too many huge flaws in the story. Oddly, the word prostitution is never mentioned. The circumstances leading up to the ""deal"" are odd, too. We never actually find out just what it is about Demi Moore's character that the billionaire finds so appealing. He smiles whenever he watches the husband and wife together, as if he's getting some kind of kick out of it. But what is behind the smiling? Is he thinking that he'd enjoy being a wedge in the relationship, wondering if he has the power to break it up? I suppose we may assume he felt a purely physical attraction, but surely he has easy (and cheaper) access to women even more beautiful than Demi.We never learn why he offers a million dollars to sleep with Demi. Is it just because he is in a particularly mischievous mood that evening in Las Vegas, or is he really so hopelessly drawn to her? Even more mysterious is why this playboy bachelor in his fifties would fall in love with a happily married woman in a one night stand for which he paid a million dollars. We find out later that the playboy billionaire has a soft spot in his cold heart and for reasons we never discover he decides that Demi is the person who can bring love and happiness to his empty life and sprawling mansion.The billionaire frequently says how ""amazing"" Demi is, but he never says why she is amazing. We never see them have a real conversation, or even exchange tender words. As a person, Demi has no dreams of her own. She is a not-so-successful real estate agent, and she doesn't seem to have any ambitions other than to be the wife of a successful architect husband. The husband seems to feel the pressure from this and worries that his wife is feeling disappointed and frustrated. The billionaire criticizes the husband for allowing his wife to sleep with him, but he never criticizes the wife. I ask you, since it is HER body, who is the more responsible party? Not to mention the fact that it was the wife who really convinced the husband it would be okay.Yet another huge flaw is the unexplained and sudden jump from Demi hating the billionaire to loving him. Even after the deal was consummated, the billionaire continued to interfere with the couple's life in an obvious attempt to break up the marriage. The wife had good reason to hate him for this, because it demonstrated that he was willing to abuse power and hurt people in order to satisfy his selfish desires. But what does Demi do when her husband's anger and doubts get the better of him? She runs back to the billionaire and falls for his sweet talk, and before long they plan to get married.This movie only pretends to look at how gray-area moral decisions can affect our lives. One could just as well ask if it is moral to be a workaholic miser in order to make a million dollars, or the CEO of, say, a cigarette company. There are a million ways to sacrifice oneself on the altar of money and power. The moral component of this movie is watered down because the husband and wife are not ""innocent"" or sympathetic characters. They gamble all of their money in Las Vegas, in the idiotic pursuit of getting the money they want quickly, and even after winning a large amount, they gamble all of that on a single bet, which of course they lose. What do I care, and how surprising is it, if such a husband and wife then accept a million dollars for a one night stand?There are the old jokes about how the price of sex determines whether someone is a prostitute. This movie mixes up money with love. How might the story play out without the billionaire falling in love? How might a good marriage be affected without all of the silly complications in this movie? If a happily married couple were to accept such an offer, is it by definition a bad marriage? If a happily married couple were to make the mistake of accepting such an offer, how might they recover from the mistake? Is accepting such an offer worse, or more damaging, than an affair? Alas, none of these more nuanced topics are covered in this movie. Instead we get a simplistic plot that merely teases. I suppose ""Indecent Proposal"" was a good prequel for Demi's next movie ""Striptease.""",2,Indecent waste of time,1222819200,"10 1, 2008",2008,4542,"['movie', 'came', 'out', '15', 'years', 'ago', 'was', ""n't"", 'impressed', 'back', 'then', 'even', 'less', 'so', 'now', 'So', 'why', 'did', 'watch', 'again', 'sister', 'had', 'different', 'memories', 'how', 'ended', 'sister', 'was', 'right', 'wrong', 'being', 'good', 'movie', 'then', 'pretty', 'much', 'likes', 'anything', 'Demi', 'Moore', 'Go', 'figure', 'movie', 'loosely', 'based', 'novel', 'Jack', 'Engelhard.There', 'are', 'too', 'many', 'huge', 'flaws', 'story', 'Oddly', 'word', 'prostitution', 'never', 'mentioned', 'circumstances', 'leading', 'up', 'deal', 'are', 'odd', 'too', 'never', 'actually', 'find', 'out', 'just', 'what', 'Demi', 'Moore', 'character', 'billionaire', 'so', 'appealing', 'whenever', 'husband', 'wife', 'together', 'getting', 'kind', 'kick', 'what', 'smiling', 'thinking', ""'d"", 'enjoy', 'being', 'wedge', 'relationship', 'wondering', 'power', 'break', 'up', 'suppose', 'may', 'assume', 'felt', 'purely', 'physical', 'attraction', 'surely', 'easy', 'cheaper', 'access', 'women', 'even', 'more', 'beautiful', 'Demi.We', 'never', 'learn', 'why', 'million', 'dollars', 'sleep', 'Demi', 'just', 'particularly', 'mischievous', 'mood', 'evening', 'Las', 'Vegas', 'really', 'so', 'hopelessly', 'drawn', 'Even', 'more', 'mysterious', 'why', 'playboy', 'bachelor', 'fifties', 'would', 'fall', 'love', 'happily', 'married', 'woman', 'one', 'night', 'stand', 'paid', 'million', 'dollars', 'find', 'out', 'later', 'playboy', 'billionaire', 'soft', 'spot', 'cold', 'heart', 'reasons', 'never', 'discover', 'Demi', 'person', 'who', 'can', 'bring', 'love', 'happiness', 'empty', 'life', 'sprawling', 'mansion.The', 'billionaire', 'frequently', 'how', 'amazing', 'Demi', 'never', 'why', 'amazing', 'never', 'see', 'have', 'real', 'conversation', 'even', 'exchange', 'tender', 'words', 'person', 'Demi', 'dreams', 'own', 'not-so-successful', 'real', 'estate', 'agent', ""n't"", 'seem', 'have', 'ambitions', 'other', 'be', 'wife', 'successful', 'architect', 'husband', 'husband', 'feel', 'pressure', 'wife', 'feeling', 'disappointed', 'frustrated', 'billionaire', 'husband', 'allowing', 'wife', 'sleep', 'never', 'wife', 'ask', 'HER', 'body', 'who', 'more', 'responsible', 'party', 'Not', 'mention', 'fact', 'was', 'wife', 'who', 'really', 'convinced', 'husband', 'would', 'be', 'okay.Yet', 'huge', 'flaw', 'unexplained', 'sudden', 'jump', 'Demi', 'hating', 'billionaire', 'loving', 'Even', 'deal', 'was', 'consummated', 'billionaire', 'continued', 'interfere', 'couple', 'life', 'obvious', 'attempt', 'break', 'up', 'marriage', 'wife', 'had', 'good', 'reason', 'hate', 'demonstrated', 'was', 'willing', 'abuse', 'power', 'hurt', 'people', 'order', 'satisfy', 'selfish', 'desires', 'what', 'Demi', 'do', 'when', 'husband', 'anger', 'doubts', 'get', 'better', 'back', 'billionaire', 'sweet', 'talk', 'long', 'plan', 'get', 'married.This', 'movie', 'only', 'look', 'how', 'gray-area', 'moral', 'decisions', 'can', 'affect', 'lives', 'One', 'could', 'just', 'as', 'well', 'moral', 'be', 'workaholic', 'miser', 'order', 'make', 'million', 'dollars', 'CEO', 'say', 'cigarette', 'company', 'are', 'million', 'ways', 'sacrifice', 'altar', 'money', 'power', 'moral', 'component', 'movie', 'watered', 'down', 'husband', 'wife', 'are', 'not', 'innocent', 'sympathetic', 'characters', 'gamble', 'money', 'Las', 'Vegas', 'idiotic', 'pursuit', 'getting', 'money', 'want', 'quickly', 'even', 'winning', 'large', 'amount', 'gamble', 'single', 'bet', 'course', 'lose', 'What', 'do', 'care', 'how', 'surprising', 'husband', 'wife', 'then', 'accept', 'million', 'dollars', 'one', 'night', 'stand', 'are', 'old', 'jokes', 'how', 'price', 'sex', 'determines', 'someone', 'prostitute', 'movie', 'up', 'money', 'love', 'How', 'might', 'story', 'play', 'billionaire', 'falling', 'love', 'How', 'might', 'good', 'marriage', 'be', 'affected', 'silly', 'complications', 'movie', 'happily', 'married', 'couple', 'were', 'accept', 'offer', 'definition', 'bad', 'marriage', 'happily', 'married', 'couple', 'were', 'make', 'mistake', 'accepting', 'such', 'offer', 'how', 'might', 'recover', 'mistake', 'accepting', 'such', 'offer', 'worse', 'more', 'damaging', 'affair', 'Alas', 'none', 'more', 'nuanced', 'topics', 'are', 'covered', 'movie', 'Instead', 'get', 'simplistic', 'plot', 'merely', 'suppose', 'Indecent', 'Proposal', 'was', 'good', 'prequel', 'Demi', 'next', 'movie', 'Striptease']",N/A

Over the years I have watched it several times and enjoy just as much as the first time.  Never being much of a Woody Harrelson fan, 'Proposal', to me, is his best work and and the rest of the characters were cast perfectly.  Say what you will about Demi Moore, but she was stylish and also gave one of her best performances.  Robert Redford is a pleasure to watch in any role he plays.  The story is original and Adrian Lyne struck a jackpot in portraying devoted lovers faced with a difficult proposition that will either make or break them..  I'll say no more as it will spoil it for others, but if you love sappy love flics, check this one out.",4,Love Everlasting....,1285459200,"09 26, 2010",2010,730,"['Indecent', 'Proposal', 'became', 'one', 'very', 'favorite', 'films', 'first', 'viewing', 'years', 'have', 'watched', 'several', 'times', 'enjoy', 'just', 'as', 'much', 'first', 'time', 'Never', 'being', 'much', 'Woody', 'Harrelson', 'fan', 'best', 'work', 'rest', 'characters', 'were', 'cast', 'perfectly', 'Say', 'what', 'will', 'about', 'Demi', 'Moore', 'was', 'stylish', 'also', 'gave', 'one', 'best', 'performances', 'Robert', 'Redford', 'pleasure', 'watch', 'role', 'story', 'original', 'Adrian', 'Lyne', 'struck', 'jackpot', 'portraying', 'devoted', 'lovers', 'faced', 'difficult', 'proposition', 'will', 'either', 'make', 'break', 'them..', ""'ll"", 'say', 'no', 'more', 'will', 'spoil', 'others', 'love', 'sappy', 'love', 'flics', 'check', 'one', 'out']",N/A
