853304,A3DVS9Y4Z1HIDJ,B0002ZDWA8,"Bob Lind ""camelwest""","[5, 6]","The intensely dark and compelling ""Twist"" (2003) is loosely based on Dickens' ""Oliver Twist,"", with the boy pickpockets replaced by a band of junkie hustlers working out of the seedy section of Toronto.  The story centers more on Dodge (Nick ""Bully"" Stahl in a standout intense performance), who befriends a new runaway, pretty blonde Oliver (Joshua Close).  Dodge takes him under his wing and indoctrinates him into the group, which is run by an unseen pimp (Bill) and managed by the brutal enforcer Fagin (Gary Farmer). The hangout for the boys is the local ""Three Cripples Diner"", with the waitress duties shared by two young women (including Bill's wife Nancy, played wonderfully by Mich&egrave;le-Barbara Pelletier) who are surrogate mothers/big sisters to the boys.  The quick loss of Oliver's innocence is seen, as we also learn about Dodge's background (through a visit from his brother) and why he ran away to become a part of this situation.Since the boys are male prostitutes, there is simulated sexual situations and content, but there is no nudity or explicit scenes to detract from the seriousness of the film.  Director Jacob Tierneyskillfully weaves a believeable and compelling, through gutwrenching, original story based on the Dickens classic. All of the actors named above, especially Stahl, deliver marvelous, powerful performances that provide depth to their characters. The film seems much shorter than its 97 minutes, and does not have a happy ending.  Much recommended to those who can appreciate the art involved, and who won't get mired down in the profession of the characters or a comparison to the original source.Official site:[...]",4,Extremely dark and heart-wrenching masterpiece,1100044800,"11 10, 2004",2004,1663,"['intensely', 'dark', 'compelling', 'Twist', '2003', 'loosely', 'based', 'Dickens', 'Oliver', 'Twist', 'boy', 'pickpockets', 'replaced', 'band', 'junkie', 'hustlers', 'working', 'seedy', 'section', 'Toronto', 'story', 'centers', 'more', 'Dodge', 'Nick', 'Bully', 'Stahl', 'standout', 'intense', 'performance', 'who', 'new', 'runaway', 'pretty', 'blonde', 'Oliver', 'Joshua', 'Close', 'Dodge', 'wing', 'group', 'run', 'unseen', 'pimp', 'Bill', 'managed', 'brutal', 'enforcer', 'Fagin', 'Gary', 'Farmer', 'hangout', 'boys', 'local', 'Three', 'Cripples', 'Diner', 'waitress', 'duties', 'shared', 'two', 'young', 'women', 'including', 'Bill', 'wife', 'Nancy', 'played', 'wonderfully', 'Mich', 'egrave', 'le-Barbara', 'Pelletier', 'who', 'are', 'surrogate', 'mothers/big', 'sisters', 'boys', 'quick', 'loss', 'Oliver', 'innocence', 'seen', 'also', 'learn', 'Dodge', 'background', 'visit', 'brother', 'why', 'ran', 'away', 'become', 'part', 'situation.Since', 'boys', 'are', 'male', 'prostitutes', 'simulated', 'sexual', 'situations', 'content', 'nudity', 'explicit', 'scenes', 'detract', 'seriousness', 'film', 'Director', 'Jacob', 'Tierneyskillfully', 'believeable', 'compelling', 'gutwrenching', 'original', 'story', 'based', 'Dickens', 'classic', 'actors', 'named', 'especially', 'Stahl', 'deliver', 'marvelous', 'powerful', 'performances', 'provide', 'depth', 'characters', 'film', 'much', 'shorter', '97', 'minutes', 'not', 'have', 'happy', 'ending', 'Much', 'recommended', 'who', 'can', 'appreciate', 'art', 'involved', 'who', 'wo', ""n't"", 'get', 'mired', 'down', 'profession', 'characters', 'comparison', 'original', 'source.Official', 'site', '[', ']']",Twist
853305,A2MUD2VY9HWFXQ,B0002ZDWA8,Boggman!,"[25, 29]","Poor nave Oliver. Mommy has passed away and he never knew his daddy. After a series of misfortunate events, he has found himself to be a 16 year old orphan/ runaway on the streets of Toronto. Lucky for him, while hanging out in a local caf&eacute;, he is discovered by Dodge, who seems to have a little experience in recognizing poor lost souls with no where to go.Dodge is rather street wise, after all; he has been pounding the pavement nightly for quite sometime as a hustler himself. He offers Oliver some food and a place to stay, which Oliver gladly accepts.Dodge and a few of his cohorts live in a ramshackle abandoned building with their ""supervisor"" Fagin watching there every move. Fagin reports to Bill (whom we never see); who runs his stable of boys & girls with an iron fist.Dodge also has quite a nasty heroin addiction, which he relies on to get the job done every night. Dodge decides to train Oliver in his wicked ways, which the young Oliver seems more than up to the task of learning.So is the story of Jacob Tierney's adaptation of the classic Dickens novel ""Oliver Twist"". This is NOT the Oliver that I remember growing up; but it is still a decent movie nonetheless.The movie chronicles the lives of these young men & women in a gritty and depressing fashion. The movie centers around Dodge, who is played quite skillfully by Nick Stahl. Oliver (Joshua Close) just happens to be the catalyst that could bring the whole business crashing down.....Will he survive the clutches of Dodge, Fagin, and Bill? Well, you'd have to watch to find out for yourself.Dodge himself is quite an interesting character, and we get to find out about his family background and what has led him up to this point. It's quite a downer of a story, but an intriguing one as well.If you like movies that depict stories of sexual abuse and addiction, then ""Twist"" should be right up your alley. However, there are scenes in ""Twist"" (one in particular that is SO disturbing and so pervasive that it's barely watch able) that really make the movie hard to stomach.The film is finely acted, written, and directed. ""Twist"" balances a fine line between reality and sickness in our culture. Worth seeing once; but this reviewer would have trouble watching Twist again due to some of it's content (especially the scene mentioned above). Some things, I do not feel need to be depicted just quite yet on film; no matter how brutally honest their intent may be.Recommended, but only for those audiences who like their movies harsh and unforgiving. By the time Twist has concluded, this reviewer doubts that you'll be asking ""Please sir, may I have some more""?",4,Twisted!!,1118707200,"06 14, 2005",2005,2645,"['Poor', 'nave', 'Oliver', 'Mommy', 'passed', 'away', 'never', 'knew', 'daddy', 'series', 'misfortunate', 'events', 'found', 'be', '16', 'year', 'old', 'orphan/', 'runaway', 'streets', 'Toronto', 'Lucky', 'hanging', 'out', 'local', 'caf', 'eacute', 'discovered', 'Dodge', 'who', 'have', 'little', 'experience', 'recognizing', 'poor', 'lost', 'souls', 'where', 'go.Dodge', 'rather', 'street', 'wise', 'been', 'pounding', 'pavement', 'nightly', 'quite', 'sometime', 'hustler', 'food', 'place', 'stay', 'Oliver', 'gladly', 'accepts.Dodge', 'few', 'cohorts', 'live', 'ramshackle', 'abandoned', 'building', 'supervisor', 'Fagin', 'watching', 'there', 'move', 'Fagin', 'reports', 'Bill', 'whom', 'never', 'see', 'who', 'stable', 'boys', 'girls', 'iron', 'fist.Dodge', 'also', 'quite', 'nasty', 'heroin', 'addiction', 'get', 'job', 'done', 'night', 'Dodge', 'train', 'Oliver', 'wicked', 'ways', 'young', 'Oliver', 'more', 'up', 'task', 'learning.So', 'story', 'Jacob', 'Tierney', 'adaptation', 'classic', 'Dickens', 'novel', 'Oliver', 'Twist', 'NOT', 'Oliver', 'remember', 'growing', 'up', 'still', 'decent', 'movie', 'nonetheless.The', 'movie', 'lives', 'young', 'men', 'women', 'gritty', 'depressing', 'fashion', 'movie', 'centers', 'Dodge', 'who', 'played', 'quite', 'skillfully', 'Nick', 'Stahl', 'Oliver', 'Joshua', 'Close', 'just', 'be', 'catalyst', 'could', 'bring', 'whole', 'business', 'crashing', 'down', '..Will', 'survive', 'clutches', 'Dodge', 'Fagin', 'Bill', 'Well', ""'d"", 'have', 'watch', 'find', 'out', 'yourself.Dodge', 'quite', 'interesting', 'character', 'get', 'find', 'out', 'family', 'background', 'led', 'up', 'point', 'quite', 'downer', 'story', 'intriguing', 'one', 'well.If', 'movies', 'depict', 'stories', 'sexual', 'abuse', 'addiction', 'then', 'Twist', 'should', 'be', 'right', 'alley', 'However', 'are', 'scenes', 'Twist', 'one', 'particular', 'SO', 'disturbing', 'so', 'pervasive', 'barely', 'watch', 'able', 'really', 'make', 'movie', 'hard', 'stomach.The', 'film', 'finely', 'acted', 'written', 'directed', 'Twist', 'fine', 'line', 'reality', 'sickness', 'culture', 'seeing', 'once', 'reviewer', 'would', 'have', 'trouble', 'watching', 'Twist', 'again', 'due', 'content', 'especially', 'scene', 'mentioned', 'things', 'do', 'not', 'feel', 'need', 'be', 'depicted', 'just', 'quite', 'yet', 'film', 'matter', 'how', 'brutally', 'honest', 'intent', 'may', 'be.Recommended', 'only', 'audiences', 'who', 'like', 'movies', 'harsh', 'unforgiving', 'time', 'Twist', 'concluded', 'reviewer', ""'ll"", 'be', 'asking', 'Please', 'sir', 'may', 'have', 'more']",Twist

Homsher,"[4, 6]","The plot is centered on the interaction of Oliver(Joshua Close)and Dodge(Nick Stahl), two emotionally starved and troubled young men engaged in prostitution.  Unfortunately, this theme is diluted by various dead-end subplots and ancillary happenings.  Close and Stahl are attractive and engaging to watch but their characters' relationship is not sufficiently developed.  Consequently, the film seems flat--an unfocused morality tale.Reality is also undercut by the uneven depiction of drugs, sex, and violence. Drug use is graphically shown (needles slowly puncture arms), but despite a foundation of male prostitution, sexual matters are decidedly PG (a shirt is removed in one scene).  Violence is likewise heavily filtered (bloodied faces turn up after the fact).  I don't need the graphic to enjoy a movie.  Here, though, it felt like grit and substance were being edited and censored.  Are we seeing real lives or not?The film begins nowhere and ends nowhere and we ""learn"" for an hour and a half that drugs and prostitution lead nowhere.  I had hoped for something more.

853307,A15Q9YEG1XPEJN,B0002ZDWA8,Get What We Give,"[7, 11]","At first when you read the description of this film, you think to yourself, ""Wow, this is really a unique updating of the Charles Dickens story: Oliver Twist!"" Then when you watch it, you realize that it really isn't terribly unique or ingenious - and that's a compliment. That the producers/director have updated Oliver Twist for the 21st century is really a film update that was due. HOWEVER, even Nick Stahl's emotional and finely tuned performance as the Artful ""Dodger"" cannot save this film from itself.With Roman Polanski having just put out arguably the most banal version of Oliver Twist, this ""Twist"" is a welcome diversion.  It is a shame, then, that the pathos and feeling of uncomfortable doom does not permiate this film more than it does.This Oliver Twist has Fagin as a pimp for a group of desperate boys who are gay for pay. Bill Sykes is apparently the mastermind behind the whole thing. Dodger is the best of the boys and recruits young gay runaway Oliver into the business. Oliver falls in love with Dodger only to be repeatedly rebuffed by the ""straight"" Dodger.We, as the artful ""Dodger"" make far too many trips to the sad little diner where Nancy works where little happens and the trips don't drive the story. There are too many character entrances into Fagin's warehouse, rather than letting us get to know its eccentricities and feel its despair.Who is Charlie - we see him - we talk to him - we even know that he identifies as a straight boy, though he is gay for pay. But we don't know him or any of his backstory.Frankly, we don't know any of the boys in this film too well. Oh, we learn about Oliver - who is quite well played by Joshua Close; and we eventually learn about Dodger, but these are the only two boys we get to really know.That Bill Sykes is an unseen presence is an interesting feature of the film, but quite frankly I never felt the evilness that this man was supposed to represent. In fact, Fagin (Gary Farmer) comes off more evil than Sykes - and Mr. Farmer, a very large portly man seems more of a benevolent former Hells Angel than anything else.Nancy supplies heroin to the boys, but this is not really played to its full potential. It should be Fagin and Nancy injecting the boys with heroin to keep them compliant - THAT would make these characters more sinister. It would also have made Nancy all the more redeemable when she tries to help Oliver. Instead it's the boys themselves who shoot up, but infrequently and randomly, coming off more as victims of their own addiction rather than victims of their circumstances.The filmmakers have the johns in this film take the boys off to nice decent looking places and/or treat them kindly. It's as if we should be pleased for the boys as they do their tricking. NO! Why not have some of the john's be decent, but also show how some of them beat the daylights out of the boys or stiff them for their money while they drag them to seedy hotels or dirty alleys? Where's the ever present threat of disease that the boys face? Where's the reality that many of them ARE diseased? This aspect of their frightening lives is too homoginized for my belief.The most believable of the horrible acts comes at the end of this film where Dodger is subjected to a cruelty that he thought he'd left when he ran away from home. Unfortunately, it doesn't fit in with the emotion of his brother in the scene. Is it painful for the brother? Apparently. Then why does he do it? Is he trying to teach his brother a lesson? Is he doing it because he wants to humiliate Dodger? It doesn't play with the dialogue that has gone before. However, the subsequent scene with Dodger is fitting with what has just transpired with his brother. I believe Dodger is actually in the throes of death (by his own hand) when the climactic scene with Bill Sykes takes place, but is not apparent.The full resolution of the film is ultimately cheap - a cop out. We see Oliver as Dodger, demonstrating that he has been so corrupted that he is now forced to become as emotionally detached as Dodger. But how can this be? It doesn't fit with his character, nor does it make practical sense. All of the characters who would keep him in this life have died. The realization of his character's birth and being turned away as a result of it would more than likely keep Oliver in the life, but not in the sad state that Fagin and Sykes kept the boys.I wanted to like this film far more than I did. It's an interesting diversion. However, I don't think this film was any where near the desolate dipiction that such an update deserves. It should be a far more horrifying dipiction than the producers/director presented. Twist could have been a truly visceral experience, and it copped out.Worth a viewing, but nothing nearly as dramatic or emotionally involving as some reviewers (whom I assume are much younger than myself) have written that it is.",2,This Twist is no Oliver!,1128297600,"10 3, 2005",2005,4895,"['first', 'when', 'read', 'description', 'film', 'think', 'yourself', 'Wow', 'really', 'unique',

853308,AAPFN1BADMWMC,B0002ZDWA8,"Giancarlo Croce ""Offer VOID where prohibited""","[10, 16]","Let's see... Oliver Twist as a heroin addicted prostitute.  Not much of a twist there.  I think we always imagined how homeless orphans made their living, but Dickens was Victorian enough to leave the details to our imagination.All the elements of the original tale are here.  There's Nick, as the street-wise Dodger and Josh Close as Oliver, the innocent new arrival. There's a grotesque Fagin as the boy's keeper, and an oddly invisible Bill Sykes, who terrorizes everyone around him. There's even a rich old man, who in the end, never adopts Oliver, proving to the boy that some people were just never meant to fit into society.Fans of Nick Stahl will watch him peel potatoes for two hours, and say how wonderful he was.  That's the essence of Hollywood. Stars sell movies.  Even bad stories can get sold if a popular actor's name appears in the credits.  I confess to being a fan of Nick Stahl.  I usually enjoy watching him work because he brings such unfiltered emotion to his parts, but watching him struggle through this movie was torture.  Ignore the poor sound quality, the lack of continuity, the odd color presentation, and the general lack of a script, and you have a half-told tale of life for street kids in any large city in the world. Nothing new, and unlike the original Dickens tale, nothing to stir your imagination.So what's the twist?  This turns out to be a story about prostitutes without a single sex scene. Very Canadian I suppose.  Not even a quick shot of someone pulling up their pants after the deed is done.  Several deeds are implied, and a couple go undone, but as far as sex goes, I think I could show this to my grandmother without offending her.  It's a cowardly approach to the subject matter.As I said before, fans of Nick Stahl will buy this because he's in it, no matter what it's about.

853309,A328S9RN3U5M68,B0002ZDWA8,Grady Harp,"[32, 34]","It seems everyone knows the Charles Dickens' novel 'Oliver Twist', if not from reading it, viewing old movie forms, or from seeing the long-running musical adaptation 'Oliver!'. And knowing that Dickens had a penchant for exposing forced child labor and abuse in the darker parts of London's seedy side, creating affecting tales of woe, only to find a happy ending in the last pages - knowing that may bring surprise at the adaptation of Dickens by screenwriter/director Jacob Tierney.But TWIST is a contemporary look at issues that persist, this time around the boys housed and fed by Fagin and kept in line by Bill Sykes are not pickpockets but hustlers. This adaptation is as searingly disturbing as was Dickens' novel when it was published: runaway boys in Toronto find a means of existence by hustling johns on the cold streets and turning over their earnings to Fagin who in turn serves as their pimp. The evil Bill Sykes is retained in this version, cleverly off screen in visibility, but his misdeeds are still in view in his drug dealing and his abuse of the boy's kind 'surrogate mother', Nancy.So the basic story remains intact and the message of the original is as tough to see, but the real difference is in Tierney's refusal to provide a happy ending - a decision that truly makes this excellent film more powerful.The main character in TWIST is Dodge (the Artful Dodger) (Nick Stahl in a superb performance that grabs your heart and never lets go) who does his hustling but also is addicted to heroin. He befriends another runaway lad named Oliver (Joshua Close) who needs shelter and love and is drawn into the Fagin stable. Fagin (Gary Farmer) is a multifaceted character who at once keeps his boys in line out of fear of Bill Sykes' demands, yet has a very soft spot for his charges. The boys (including Charley played by Moti Yona) often meet at the Three Cripples Diner where Nancy (Michele-Barbara Pelletier) serves them food and caring, despite her omnipresent physical evidence of Bill Sykes' abuse.Dodge looks after his prot&eacute;g&eacute; Oliver, introduces him to the world of hustling, and nurtures him in a way that reflects Dodge's own needs. Oliver falls in love with Dodge but the feelings and approaches are one-sided. We finally discover a bit of Dodge's past when his older brother David (Tygh Runyan) visits and tries unsuccessfully to resolve old family problems (an abusive father). Their midnight antagonistic confrontations supply some of the more memorable moments in the film.The seeds of corruption inherent in this bad life play to many tragedies and disclosing them would rob the film of its power. The circle of unfortunate circumstances comes round and we are left feeling deeply about these unlucky kids and their lifestyle. One of the many reasons this film works is the director's refusal to include gratuitous scenes of sexual encounters, a technique that makes those obvious encounters all the more powerful because they are left to the imagination of the audience.The cinematography captures all the filth, despair, cold and hopelessness of the back streets of Toronto. This is a tough film to take, but one that makes a major impact and should be seen to appreciate the extremes to which our runaway kids go to survive in times of the lack of meaningful love.

Here the urchins are hustlers, not pick pockets.  Aside from the names (our lead characters are Oliver and Dodge, with their pimp being Fagan) the similarities are limited.  Although, Twist is faithful to the social reformist urgency which is key in the writings of Charles Dickens.Having said that, I really thought this was a good film. It is not uplifting at all, there is little or no redemption, but the characters are very real, the acting is very good and you will become emotionally involved.  You will care about these characters by the end, they have depth.  I won't spoil the film for you but there are three scenes that will completely break your heart, two involving Oliver and one involving Dodge.The film is not graphic in anything other than subject matter. The scenes on the cold winter streets of Toronto made me shiver (anyone in Northern Cities will understand). The film is just the right length.  I would recommend that you at least rent this film.

853312,A3UDYY6L2NH3JS,B0002ZDWA8,"Jacques COULARDEAU ""A soul doctor, so to say""","[0, 0]","A film that is trying to imagine what Oliver Twist would be and do in our modern world today. The idea is that he would be a hustler, either after various successive foster homes or after a family he runs away from. Not a real orphan because that hardly exists today but the victim of some kind of social care that would in fact produce just the same bad results as the desire to escape one's family and travel a road of forbidden freedom.But is it freedom?The freedom to be taken care of by a pimp who is violent and checks the proceedings and the earnings very closely. The freedom to live in a one room warehouse with many others and no privacy, not to speak of comfort. The freedom to shoot heroin into one's vein any time one wants till one ODs. Is that freedom?The freedom to sell yourself in the cold night to anyone coming up who could be a gay-basher and mug you in the back alley. There is no hope. The main character only has one choice left, and is this a choice? He has to turn his frustration onto the people who accompanied him in that descent to hell, to a type of exploitation that does not even have a name in any decent language. And then he will turn his violence onto himself not to face the accusations he would have to be confronted to from the police and the rule is to evade the police, and for the police the rule is to ignore those who evade the police without causing too much trouble.But there is no way out really and when one vanishes in thin air and ashes one will take his place immediately and follow the same tracks, pimp or hustler.We are not talking of love here, of freedom here. We are talking of the descent into the first principle of some cheap philosophers and fundamentalist gurus: survival at all cost. And that survival might go along with easy money because it is easy to sell your flesh, but sooner or later you'll have to lose your blood and this time survival will no longer be the rule.That Oliver is twisted to the extreme, so twisted that you can't reach to him any more, no matter what and no matter how much love you may put on the table, spread at his feet. For this version of Oliver Twist love itself is an aggression, an assault, an attack against his integrity, his freedom, his dignity.

Joshua Close (whom I'd never heard of) is especially moving and believable as the sweetly naive and vulnerable quasi-title character Oliver, and Nick Stahl is brilliant as always playing a deeply troubled but fascinating victim of his past and his own bad choices. All the secondary roles are very well played too, and through their performances the never-seen-or-heard Bill indirectly but effectively casts his ominous pall over everything.Twistis more than just another hustler movie, much richer thanJohns, for example. It's a morality tale that's also consistently entertaining, never sentimental, preachy, or cheap. I've read reviews that criticize writer-director Jacob Tierney for taking such liberties with the Dickens novel, but the fact that this little movie aims so high and succeeds is one of its greatest strengths. It successfully achieves the same rare, transcendent balance of depravity and tenderness that Dickens does so well. Like reading Dickens, watching Twist is a dark and challenging but richly rewarding experience.The DVD is fine, but the ""director's commentary"" is more like eavesdropping on a casual and sometimes barely audible private conversation between him and Stahl. They're old friends, and they spend a good deal of the time taking friendly jabs at each other as old friends do, but it's not particularly interesting to an outsider.
