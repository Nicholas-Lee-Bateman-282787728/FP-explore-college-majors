1678928,A27H9DOUGY9FOS,B00GMPZRD2,"K. Harris ""Film aficionado""","[7, 7]","I was intrigued when I heard that writer/director Christian Martin was doing a follow-up piece to the tough ""Shank"" from 2009. As I hadn't seen that movie in a number of years, I decided to refresh my memory about the journey of its young protagonist Cal. This gritty picture is really a classic coming-of-age story with a tough street punk coming to grips with his sexual identity and starting to connect with the life he wants to lead as opposed to the one he's grown accustomed to. ""Shank"" is fairly divisive, some say it's a masterpiece while others aren't so generous. From a technical standpoint, the movie is certainly rough around the edges (just like our hero). Both amateurish and over-the top at times, the picture still connects on a visceral level that resonated with me. And in that way, it is successful at what it attempts. The sequel, 2013's ""Cal,"" is no less ambitious. In fact, it's ideas are much more complex thematically. But by attempting something a little bigger, Martin has come up with something that feels altogether less organic and truthful.Shank (4 Stars): When we meet Cal (Wayne Virgo), he is a closeted bad boy that runs with his crew, secretly lusts after his best mate, and keeps up a facade even as the gang commits rather random acts of violence. One day, something snaps in Cal as he is part of an attack on a relatively flamboyant foreign student (Marc Laurent). He breaks up the fight and this seems to be the complete undoing of his life. The transition itself is rough. In one scene, he is lifelong friends with these guys but, after this event, they're willing to murder him. As Cal takes a forced break from his mates, he has nowhere to go except into the arms of Laurent. The relationship develops and Cal sees another chance at life. Things continue to spiral out of control, however, until the inevitably violent conclusion brings Cal's world into focus. Although gritty and occasionally silly, Cal's sense of hope, desperation, and need of connection are palpable and effective. It's not a perfect movie, by any means, but it works.Cal (2 Stars): Everything that I connected with on an emotional level is absent from the sequel. Cal returns to Britain upon the news that his mother is ill. Not much is referenced in way of back story so this would be perfectly fine as a stand-alone piece. The only thing we learn is that Cal has been traveling Europe and working in the culinary trade. Martin (as both writer and director) paints this as a significant movie by the depiction of economic despair that has brought the city to its knees. Unrest, anger, and outright violence shadow every scene and make for a rather gloomy backdrop. Heck, just wait until you see the assistance working sneer at a very polite and well-spoken Cal because he's asking about a job. A little subtlety would have benefited the movie considerably. Although never mentioned in the previous movie, Cal is taken into his mother's home by her lodger (a rather comical Emily Corcoran). Cal is resistant to see his mother due to her disappointment about his life choices. But aside from a nice scene at the end, not enough is made of this plot point. Instead, Cal gets into trouble breaking up a fight in a public restroom. A young hustler is being beaten by his handler. Before you can say ""boo,"" Cal is pressed into the unsavory services of a new brand of thug and is once again experiencing an unlikely romance.The problem, for me, with ""Cal"" is that it wants to be too many things. Is it a social critique of our economic decline? Is it a reconciliation story, a continuation of the coming-of-age sage as Cal comes to terms with his family? Or is it a look at the seamier side of prostitution? With a little bit of focus on each, nothing really connects. The economic side plot is so heavy handed, the family story is not developed sufficiently, and the prostitution angle is downright silly most of the time. While I was hopeful, I just didn't care for this picture. I still liked Wayne Virgo and the visible maturity he displays compared to his last effort in ""Shank."" And, at least, Corcoran is good for a laugh in an over-the-top performance. But the emotional payoff is slight (with the exception of one scene) and the action is not believable. I'll look out for Martin's next picture, but ""Cal"" didn't do it for me.

1678931,A29XKBB6SEYTN6,B00GMPZRD2,"Tommy Dooley ""Tom""","[7, 8]","This is the latest film from Bristol based producer and director Christian Martin. He has chosen to reprise the main character from his first feature length production, Cal. He was last seen as that persona in the rather good `Shank'. Wayne Virgo plays the character again and as ever is very believable. This chapter sees him return from his European travels where he has been working in kitchens as a casual.He has returned after receiving a post card from him mother's lodger, the alcoholic `Aunty Jane', who has told him his mum is in hospital. He arrives in austerity Britain when Bristol is suffering the same fate as London in the summer riots. He gets involved with a local pimp Ivan (Daniel Brocklebank) when he tries to help one of his boys Jim. Ivan takes Cal's passport and Cal decides to let Jim stay at his mum's house to escape the regular violence of the streets. Their relationship then lurches between friendship and inter dependence as they try to sort out their future and Cal tries to sort out his past.There is a lot here including sexual exploitation, poverty, dependency, drug abuse, homophobia, violence and relationship issues as well as blatant criminality. Most of the issues are handled sensitively and in an un- clich&eacute;d way, which is appreciated. There are some plot holes or stretches that some may not be over the moon with; to say what they are would be a plot spoiler. That is done for the purposes of the narrative and is only mildly irksome and actually forgivable.`Shank' was a welcome breath of independent film fresh air that tackled issues of homosexuality without being an excuse for soft porn and this is very much in the same vein. People are often victims of their circumstances and that is the case here, but what I also like is that those circumstances can be changed for the better with help and a push to make the right choices. Christian Martin has made another very watchable film that raises issues and deals with them in a very human way. Recommended for all indie fans and those who like `gay' themed films to have a bit of thought put into them.",4,Very Good Follow up to `Shank',1392508800,"02 16, 2014",2014,2106,"['latest', 'film', 'Bristol', 'based', 'producer', 'director', 'Christian', 'Martin', 'chosen', 'reprise', 'main', 'character', 'first', 'feature', 'length', 'production', 'Cal', 'was', 'last', 'seen', 'persona', 'rather', 'good', 'Shank', 'Wayne', 'Virgo', 'character', 'again', 'ever', 'very', 'believable', 'chapter', 'return', 'European', 'travels', 'where', 'been', 'working', 'kitchens', 'casual.He', 'returned', 'receiving', 'post', 'card', 'lodger', 'alcoholic', 'Aunty', 'Jane', 'who', 'told', 'mum', 'hospital', 'austerity', 'Britain', 'when', 'Bristol', 'suffering', 'same', 'fate', 'London', 'summer', 'riots', 'involved', 'local', 'pimp', 'Ivan', 'Daniel', 'Brocklebank', 'when', 'help', 'one', 'boys', 'Jim', 'Ivan', 'Cal', 'passport', 'Cal', 'let', 'Jim', 'stay', 'mum', 'house', 'escape', 'regular', 'violence', 'streets', 'relationship', 'then', 'friendship', 'inter', 'dependence', 'try', 'sort', 'out', 'future', 'Cal', 'tries', 'sort', 'out', 'past.There', 'lot', 'here', 'including', 'sexual', 'exploitation', 'poverty', 'dependency', 'drug', 'abuse', 'homophobia', 'violence', 'relationship', 'issues', 'as', 'well', 'blatant', 'criminality', 'Most', 'issues', 'are', 'handled', 'sensitively', 'un-', 'clich', 'eacute', 'd', 'way', 'appreciated', 'are', 'plot', 'holes', 'stretches', 'may', 'not', 'be', 'moon', 'say', 'what', 'are', 'would', 'be', 'plot', 'spoiler', 'done', 'purposes', 'narrative', 'only', 'mildly', 'irksome', 'actually', 'forgivable.', 'Shank', 'was', 'welcome', 'breath', 'independent', 'film', 'fresh', 'air', 'tackled', 'issues', 'homosexuality', 'being', 'excuse', 'soft', 'porn', 'very', 'much', 'same', 'vein', 'People', 'are', 'often', 'victims', 'circumstances', 'case', 'here', 'what', 'also', 'like', 'circumstances', 'can', 'be', 'changed', 'better', 'help', 'push', 'make', 'right', 'choices', 'Christian', 'Martin', 'made', 'very', 'watchable', 'film', 'issues', 'deals', 'very', 'human', 'way', 'Recommended', 'indie', 'fans', 'who', 'like', 'gay', 'themed', 'films', 'have', 'bit', 'thought', 'put']",Cal
