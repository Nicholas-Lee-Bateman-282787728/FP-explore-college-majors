Thomas ""Baroque music fan""","[0, 0]","The series holds up well, and it was a delight to revisit the world of &#34;James Herriot&#34;, with the Farnon brothers, all of Tristan's girl friends, Mrs. Pomphrey and Wicky Woo, Helen, and all of the local farmers with their reluctance to pay the &#34;brass&#34; for veterinary services rendered, especially if the critter died. Anyone who loves animals and clean entertainment will enjoy this set and all the others in the series.I watched the complete works, Series 1-specials, in a marathon. While the stories never tired me out, I must admit the theme song grew a bit wearisome after two repetitions per episode and dozens of episodes.
