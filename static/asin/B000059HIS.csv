573282,A13RM1AWD1C5ZR,B000059HIS,Daniel K.,"[2, 4]","Mary-Kate and Ashely Olsen are simply two of the hottest rising stars.  Well actually they're no rising stars, they've practically been stars since they were adolescents on a funny sitcom called Full House.  They're career started off to a huge success.  They soon made movies, tv shows, and apparrel of all sorts.Winning London, which was relased in 2001, was another typical Mary-Kate and Ashley film.  I have to say for its nice locations, it's worth a look.  But the movie's plot is pretty formulaic and similiar to all their other movies, which can be a bit boring as well disappointing.  So you wonder why I honored this movie with 4 stars, I just can't get it out my head to be honest.  Ever since they showed it on the MK & A marathon on ABC Family on New Year's Eve of 2003, I became upssesed with it.  Infact, I thought of buying on DVD,  I still haven't yet.  There's just something about the movie with is so attractive, I suppose it's Mary-Kate and Ashley, I just like the film and the setting too.The plot, I don't even know why I'll bother is simple as anything.  Mark Kate and Ashley play Chloe and Riley, not like on their show So Little Time, which is the opposite.  They're participating in a United Nations game/contest.  They are the winners of the preliminary competition and are asked if they'd like to compete in the real competition in London.  Of course they agree and are sent to London, where they meet cute guys who they hang out it.  Jesse Spencer plays Mary-Kate's love interest James.  Oddly enough Jesse Spencer is Australian and is being portrayed as British.  There are a few sterotypes and/or flaws in this movie.  What movie doesn't have flaws?The film is rated G for General Audiences.  It contains nothing extreme obviously.  Mild sexual innuendo, mainly some kissing.  No profanity obviously.  A fine pick for all ages.All in all entertaining, and am looking forward to Mark-Kate and Ashley big screen debut, New York Minute due to be released in May.

573289,A2T60EJILU9OPW,B000059HIS,"""lath123""","[5, 6]","Our lips are sealed was a great step forward in making higher quality Olsen movies, Winning London is another step ahead! When I read about Winning London at first, I expected a Passport to Paris clone, thank goodness I was wrong! The movie doesn't have the feeling of an Olsen movie, and that's a very good thing. Mary-Kate and Ashley must be in it, but their presence should not overshadow all and everything else. Also the words &quot;Model UN&quot; really confused me, I was thinking of fashion modeling all the time, not diplomacy (I must admit that I never could lay the link between fashion and the UN though)!  The story of the movie is quite boring, except for the James Bond like scenes, where Riley and Brian are going to try to rescue the &quot;hostages&quot; (it's all a setup - I like the guy who plays Iraq! UK: &quot;Who needs nukes anyway?&quot; Iraq: &quot;We do!&quot;). Although the story is a bit boring, there IS a story line (unlike movies as Passport to Paris). The plot line is even quite advanced for an Olsen movie, although it didn't really appeal to me. I prefer a bit more action, a bit more things to see, and a bit less talk. That's probably why I really liked the James Bond scene, shame it wasn't a bit longer. The movie appeared very mature, except for the scene in which Chloe and Riley tried to sneak into a meeting as guys was so totally fake! It instantly reduced the level of the movie. That scene would have been nice in a Mary-Kate and Ashley movie when they were 8, but not anymore. There were many good parts in the movie to compensate this though. The characters of Mary-Kate and Ashley were not so close-goodie-best-friends-for-life as they usually are, and they got a lot of scenes separately. Also, it weren't just Chloe and Riley, they were part of a group of 5+James and every member in that group got nearly the same amount of screentime, and they clearly formed three &quot;love couples&quot;. The cover of the videobox is quite refreshing too, compared with Billboard dad, Passport to Paris and Our lips are sealed (those three movies have very similar boxes). There are not much jokes in the movie. They few which are in it are mostly coming from Dylan. There are also a few direct pointers to Our lips are sealed, and in the sound-track the song So little time is used, of course pointing towards the new show by Mary-Kate and Ashley with the same title, expected June 2001. Speaking of music, the non-vocal soundtrack often reminded me of It takes two.In spite of the not so interesting story is Winning London another great step forward in the quality of Olsen movies and expansion of Mary-Kate and Ashley's audience, although the job is still far from finished (big screen movies might help). Mary-Kate and Ashley were great in it!

573295,A1LDIMQISH07WK,B000059HIS,Rebecca,"[3, 5]","Considering that I've not seen every single Olsen twins movie, WINNING LONDON is the best by far. It's about twins Chloe Lawrence (Mary-Kate Olsen) and Riley Lawrence (Ashley Olsen) who are off to London, England! How did they do that? To start off, Chloe is the captain of her school's Modal UN team. The Model UN is a international competition for students who are assigned different countries to debat on their issues and problems. Riley joined the team after Chloe's team won the national competition to compete in the international competition. One of Chloe's members had to drop out of the trip, so Riley volunteered just to get close to one of the team's members--Brian (Brandon Tyler). Chloe cares more about winning than boys. But once in England, Chloe comes across James Browning (Jesse Spencer), a very cute British guy who's from a rival team! There are sparks almost instantly between Chloe and James, but the heat of the competition makes it difficult for them to begin a relationship, especially when James's father finds out about Chloe and doesn't want any girls to get into James's way of winning.Another Olsen twins flick of beautiful scenary--this one was filmed in London. The acting is good, and Jesse Spencer is very, very cute! He does an excellent British accent, even though he's Australian in real life. Brandon Tyler, who plays Brian, is also very cute! I'd say that so far, WINNING LONDON has the best-looking boys in it.

573297,A1GY9NQLUPB7OA,B000059HIS,"Sam I am ""Claire Harts""","[0, 0]","This movie was a bit slow and there were a lot of useless shots that the director suggested to use in order to showcase London. Don't get me wrong there were a lot of great shots of London as well but there was an excess of footage that didn't need to be there. This made the story drag a bit. In conclusion it fell together well by the end. Well, if you're 11- 15 years old maybe. So far their best movie is Passport To Paris. Holiday In The Sun was terrible but that's probably because the twins directed that film. So I'll recommend this film, only if you're truly bored. :) I love Mary Kate and Ashley though.",3,Drags a bit....,1251763200,"09 1, 2009",2009,613,"['movie', 'was', 'bit', 'slow', 'were', 'lot', 'useless', 'shots', 'director', 'suggested', 'use', 'order', 'showcase', 'London', 'Do', ""n't"", 'get', 'wrong', 'were', 'lot', 'great', 'shots', 'London', 'as', 'well', 'was', 'excess', 'footage', 'did', ""n't"", 'need', 'be', 'there', 'made', 'story', 'bit', 'conclusion', 'fell', 'together', 'well', 'end', 'Well', ""'re"", '11-', '15', 'years', 'old', 'maybe', 'So', 'far', 'best', 'movie', 'Passport', 'Paris', 'Holiday', 'Sun', 'was', 'terrible', 'probably', 'twins', 'directed', 'film', 'So', ""'ll"", 'recommend', 'film', 'only', ""'re"", 'truly', 'bored', 'love', 'Mary', 'Kate', 'Ashley']",Winning London VHS
