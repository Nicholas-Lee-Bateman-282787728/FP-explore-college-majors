973027,A90HPVBN7LU1F,B000EHQWPQ,Book Hound,"[0, 0]","Unlike ""Baptist at the Barbeque,"" also by Halestorm Entertainment,  which was a total waste of money and one of the worst film I have ever saw,  ""Suits on the Loose"" has more acting depth and is a more enjoyable and entertaining film to watch. While one has to cringe at the occasions in the film when the actors trying to play the role of LDS missionaries actually have to perform missionary duties, there are some very good parts to the movie, especially as the Baptist overtures by one of the main actors and the LDS playing actors reacting to them. The film is a step above most films of this LDS comedy genre, such as The Single Ward 1 &2, The Best Two Years, and The R.M., so if someone wanted to buy only one any of these LDS themed comedy files, I would select this one for the family. Note that the film does requires some LDS cultural and spiritual background to understand all the jokes as they are not explained further in the film, (reason for only four stars out of five), such as the M.T.C. (Missionary Training Center) being called the Mormon Tabernacle Choir, so being familiar with the religion and culture definitely does help to enjoy the film. comedy",4,One of the Better LDS files of this comedy genre.,1390176000,"01 20, 2014",2014,1171,"['Baptist', 'Barbeque', 'also', 'Halestorm', 'Entertainment', 'was', 'total', 'waste', 'money', 'one', 'worst', 'film', 'have', 'ever', 'saw', 'Suits', 'Loose', 'more', 'acting', 'depth', 'more', 'enjoyable', 'entertaining', 'film', 'watch', 'one', 'cringe', 'occasions', 'film', 'when', 'actors', 'trying', 'play', 'role', 'LDS', 'missionaries', 'actually', 'have', 'perform', 'missionary', 'duties', 'are', 'very', 'good', 'parts', 'movie', 'especially', 'Baptist', 'overtures', 'one', 'main', 'actors', 'LDS', 'playing', 'actors', 'reacting', 'film', 'step', 'most', 'films', 'LDS', 'comedy', 'genre', 'such', 'Single', 'Ward', '1', '2', 'Best', 'Two', 'Years', 'R.M.', 'so', 'someone', 'wanted', 'buy', 'only', 'one', 'LDS', 'themed', 'comedy', 'files', 'would', 'select', 'one', 'family', 'Note', 'film', 'LDS', 'cultural', 'spiritual', 'background', 'understand', 'jokes', 'are', 'not', 'explained', 'further', 'film', 'reason', 'only', 'four', 'stars', 'five', 'such', 'M.T.C', 'Missionary', 'Training', 'Center', 'being', 'called', 'Mormon', 'Tabernacle', 'Choir', 'being', 'familiar', 'religion', 'culture', 'definitely', 'help', 'enjoy', 'film', 'comedy']",Suits on The Loose

973033,A3373I4II32NA1,B000EHQWPQ,Tyler,"[10, 10]","I've read all the reviews before purchasing this movie and all of them have a great feedback on the DVD, but say little about what the movie was about exactly, so I bought this movie and watched it, so anyone else who wants to purchase this movie has to read this review first to really get the full story.This movie is about two juveniles who are working out in the middle of the Mojave Desert at some boot-camp like facility run by a two-star general. One of the juveniles happens to be the rebellious son of a famous senator running for reelection, so for the general, catching them both is a very big deal for him.The two guys boost a crappy pickup truck with an outdated map that gives crappy directions. The truck soon breaks down in the middle of nowhere of the desert, so while the guys are trying to think about their options at this isolated rest stop, a car pulls up with two LDS missionaries inside. One of the missionaries had been eating Twinkies in the heat, so the aftereffects send him running for the bathroom. As the companion goes to help him out, both guys take the car and roar off down the road towards the newest civilization, which happens to be a town called New Harmony.The guys decide to don the extra missionary suits and go along with the flow while deciding out their next plan to escape. The kind, elderly bishop that greets them tells them that they are the first missionaries to be in the town in two years, and both guys are startled by the set of missionary rules that they must follow. (No contact with single women, no coke, no fun for them whatsoever.)Justin, the senator's son, seems to like the waitress girl who owns the local diner, but their ""friendship"" is off to a rough start. The worst part for them(and the most humorous) is that they must begin their tracting throughout the town and teach lessons about a religion that they know nothing about, like the Word of Wisdom and the covenants of Joseph Smith.Yet, the danger to exposing their identity is on the horizon. With the general out looking for them and the two REAL missionaries hot on their tail, the two men are aware that they have very limited time with the people of New Harmony. But the town and the people seem to grow on them in the end. Like the other review said, there is an ass-kicking with several redneck fellows by the two ""supposed"" missionaries, as it appears that the rednecks had driven out the other set of missionaries two years earlier, and with that comes the confession of who both guys are, followed by the arrival of the general, the senator, and both of the REAL missionaries. But even with their punishment over, both boys feel like they owe something back to the town of New Harmony for all that's happened.This is definitely a five-star rating, and the movie is very humorous and keeps you on the edge of your seat the entire time. LDS or not, you will definitely enjoy this movie!",5,Behind Suits on the Loose,1295222400,"01 17, 2011",2011,2915,"[""'ve"", 'read', 'reviews', 'purchasing', 'movie', 'have', 'great', 'feedback', 'DVD', 'say', 'little', 'what', 'movie', 'was', 'about', 'exactly', 'bought', 'movie', 'watched', 'so', 'anyone', 'else', 'who', 'purchase', 'movie', 'read', 'review', 'first', 'really', 'get', 'full', 'story.This', 'movie', 'two', 'juveniles', 'who', 'are', 'working', 'out', 'middle', 'Mojave', 'Desert', 'boot-camp', 'facility', 'run', 'two-star', 'general', 'One', 'juveniles', 'be', 'rebellious', 'son', 'famous', 'senator', 'running', 'reelection', 'so', 'general', 'catching', 'very', 'big', 'deal', 'him.The', 'two', 'guys', 'boost', 'crappy', 'pickup', 'truck', 'outdated', 'map', 'crappy', 'directions', 'truck', 'soon', 'down', 'middle', 'nowhere', 'desert', 'so', 'guys', 'are', 'trying', 'think', 'options', 'isolated', 'rest', 'stop', 'car', 'up', 'two', 'LDS', 'missionaries', 'inside', 'One', 'missionaries', 'had', 'been', 'eating', 'Twinkies', 'heat', 'aftereffects', 'send', 'running', 'bathroom', 'companion', 'help', 'out', 'guys', 'take', 'car', 'roar', 'off', 'road', 'newest', 'civilization', 'be', 'town', 'called', 'New', 'Harmony.The', 'guys', 'decide', 'don', 'extra', 'missionary', 'suits', 'go', 'along', 'flow', 'deciding', 'out', 'next', 'plan', 'escape', 'kind', 'elderly', 'bishop', 'are', 'first', 'missionaries', 'be', 'town', 'two', 'years', 'guys', 'are', 'startled', 'set', 'missionary', 'rules', 'must', 'follow', 'contact', 'single', 'women', 'coke', 'fun', 'whatsoever', 'Justin', 'senator', 'son', 'like', 'waitress', 'girl', 'who', 'local', 'diner', 'friendship', 'off', 'rough', 'start', 'worst', 'part', 'most', 'humorous', 'must', 'begin', 'tracting', 'town', 'teach', 'lessons', 'religion', 'know', 'nothing', 'Word', 'Wisdom', 'covenants', 'Joseph', 'Smith.Yet', 'danger', 'exposing', 'identity', 'horizon', 'general', 'out', 'looking', 'two', 'REAL', 'missionaries', 'hot', 'tail', 'two', 'men', 'are', 'aware', 'have', 'very', 'limited', 'time', 'people', 'New', 'Harmony', 'town', 'people', 'seem', 'grow', 'end', 'other', 'review', 'said', 'ass-kicking', 'several', 'redneck', 'fellows', 'two', 'supposed', 'missionaries', 'rednecks', 'had', 'driven', 'out', 'other', 'set', 'missionaries', 'two', 'years', 'earlier', 'confession', 'who', 'guys', 'are', 'followed', 'arrival', 'general', 'senator', 'REAL', 'missionaries', 'even', 'punishment', 'boys', 'feel', 'owe', 'something', 'back', 'town', 'New', 'Harmony', 'happened.This', 'definitely', 'five-star', 'rating', 'movie', 'very', 'humorous', 'edge', 'seat', 'entire', 'time', 'LDS', 'not', 'will', 'definitely', 'enjoy', 'movie']",Suits on The Loose
