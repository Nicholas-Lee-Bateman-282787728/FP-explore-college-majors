803923,AECVYXIL9791R,B0001FVECM,David C. Read,"[15, 19]","Antonio Banderas turns in a very strong performance as Pancho Villa, in this HBO movie.  The production values are excellent for a made-for-TV movie.  There are no heroes here.  Pancho Villa was a bandit and murderer long before he became a revolutionary general.  This movie accurately depicts that Villa was a cold-blooded killer as well as an incredibly charismatic leader of men.  The moviemakers were pretty cynical as well, insisting that all battles be fought in daylight so that they could be filmed.  Studio execs in New Jersey (where the movie industry was based in 1914, before it moved to Hollywood) edited the movie to delete Villa's criminal side and build up the idea that he was a folk hero - a sort of Mexican George Washington.There's nothing in this movie about Villa's raid on Columbus, New Mexico, in which 26 American civilians were killed, or his murder of 16 American mining engineers captured on a train, or Gen. Pershing chasing him around Mexico for several months.  Those events occurred later, a year after the filming of the movie in which he played himself.All-in-all, it is a good little movie, considering the modest budget it probably had.",4,Interesting footnote to history,1086134400,"06 2, 2004",2004,1173,"['Antonio', 'Banderas', 'very', 'strong', 'performance', 'Pancho', 'Villa', 'HBO', 'movie', 'production', 'values', 'are', 'excellent', 'made-for-TV', 'movie', 'are', 'heroes', 'here', 'Pancho', 'Villa', 'was', 'bandit', 'murderer', 'long', 'before', 'became', 'revolutionary', 'general', 'movie', 'accurately', 'Villa', 'was', 'cold-blooded', 'killer', 'as', 'well', 'incredibly', 'charismatic', 'leader', 'men', 'moviemakers', 'were', 'pretty', 'cynical', 'well', 'insisting', 'battles', 'be', 'fought', 'daylight', 'so', 'could', 'be', 'filmed', 'Studio', 'execs', 'New', 'Jersey', 'where', 'movie', 'industry', 'was', 'based', '1914', 'moved', 'Hollywood', 'edited', 'movie', 'delete', 'Villa', 'criminal', 'side', 'build', 'up', 'idea', 'was', 'folk', 'hero', 'sort', 'Mexican', 'George', 'Washington.There', 'nothing', 'movie', 'Villa', 'raid', 'Columbus', 'New', 'Mexico', '26', 'American', 'civilians', 'were', 'killed', 'murder', '16', 'American', 'mining', 'engineers', 'captured', 'train', 'Gen.', 'Pershing', 'chasing', 'Mexico', 'several', 'months', 'events', 'occurred', 'later', 'year', 'filming', 'movie', 'played', 'himself.All-in-all', 'good', 'little', 'movie', 'considering', 'modest', 'budget', 'probably', 'had']",And Starring Pancho Villa As Himself

I have been watching movies for over 50 years, and never have I seen a better job of portraying a multifaceted character while never for one second letting go of his true identity.  Bravo!  As to the movie itself, it exhibits production values and attention to detail far beyond the Hollywood norm, and unheard of in television studio production.  The history, the hardware and the costumes, were all excellent.  Unfortunately as one of my fellow reviewers has already pointed out, Senior Banderas' inspired performance, the highly polished production, the good presentation of factual history and the stellar performances of many of the minor supporting actors carried the entire production.  The script was poorly conceived and crafted.  The plot line was confused, confusing and lack luster.  The direction was safe and adequate, but not nothing more.  Worst of all, the other lead actors were either uninspired or just not really all that good at what they do.  Next time, HBO, spend a buck or two on a director who knows the wide screed and on supporting leads who can carry their weight.  Still, this is not a horrible picture.  Senior Banderas' Tour-de-force performance and the highly polished accuracy of the production make it well worthwhile.  I don't think that the movie's intent of showing an accurate picture of the early days of Hollywood was fulfilled.

This film is an interesting, ambiguous study of how perceptions can change by being validated by something bigger than they: something like the movies, which  in itself is an absurd premise, but something that we live with every day. I wish the characters in the flim were better referenced, as I know D.W. Griffith, Charles Rosher, Christy Cabanne, and others are part of the plot as in real life, but I couldn't tell you who they were in the production, as their attributions went by so fast. Villa as a villain and charismatic leader of the masses has a built-in paradox to it, as does the documentary format in film in any case.  It is a pity that the original film doesn't exist any longer (along with 90% of silent film that was made, unfortunately), especially as it was under D.W.

But the difference between a 2 star rating and a 4 star rating here is solely due to the presence of Antonio Banderas in the lead role.It sounds like such a cartoonish idea, moviemakers tagging along with an army of revolutionaries.  But then in the silent movie era of 1914, New Jersey actually was the movie making capital of the world.The subtext to all of this is that through his experience and relationship with General Villa, his erstwhile film producer Frank Thayer matures from young gofer to influential executive.  But that is nothing more than a plot device.  When Banderas is not on screen, the movie loses a step or two.

803931,A6GMEO3VRY51S,B0001FVECM,microjoe,"[2, 3]","This film was made by and for HBO. I had picked it up used at Amazon and then let it sit on shelf for over ayear before I finally watched it. It was more fun that I had expected it would be. This is not a dark and serious drama, oh to be sure it treats the subject of war and death with the reverence it deserves at times, but the movie revels in the character of Pancho Villa. At one moment a dark brutal man, next a fun loving trickster, then he is exceedingly generous and concerned for the welfare of others.  The story is mostly dramatization, quite the opposite of a documentary, but they do not pretend otherwise. We do not have enough source material to draw on to get a better picture of the events, and the real Pancho Villa films have been lost to history.The movie is very loosely based on the story of an American film company reciving an offer, by the Mexican revolutionary general Pancho Villa, to film a real life battle. This would be the first time in history a battle was to be shown on film to the public. The general somehow felt that the theatrical presentation of the Mexican conflict could cause America to consider lifting its embargo on his ability to buy American guns. The battle footage is well enough received that the company determines to return with actors and crew to flesh it out into a movie. Villa needed his side of the story told, as the Rupert Murdoch of the day in the form of WR Hearst and his newspaper empire, was editorializing and spinning the news to affect public policy and demonize the General.The film is very well made, the battle scenes exciting and authentic, costumes, sets, vintage vehicles are all very authentic. The actors take their roles seriously and a great effort is put forth to make this as believable as possible. Antonio Banderas is mesmerizing in the tough role of Villa, one hand gentle and friendly, raging the next moment. Alan Arkin has a role that could have been more developed, but he gives it much more than the role called for. The rest of the cast tries to keep up as best they can, but they are not as bad as some make it sound here, just outclassed.All in all it was a pleasant diversion for the evening.",4,A pleasant diversion for the evening,1311552000,"07 25, 2011",2011,2185,"['film', 'was', 'made', 'HBO', 'had', 'picked', 'up', 'used', 'Amazon', 'then', 'let', 'sit', 'shelf', 'ayear', 'finally', 'watched', 'was', 'more', 'fun', 'had', 'expected', 'would', 'be', 'not', 'dark', 'serious', 'drama', 'oh', 'be', 'sure', 'subject', 'war', 'death', 'reverence', 'times', 'movie', 'revels', 'character', 'Pancho', 'Villa', 'one', 'moment', 'dark', 'brutal', 'man', 'fun', 'loving', 'trickster', 'then', 'exceedingly', 'generous', 'concerned', 'welfare', 'others', 'story', 'mostly', 'dramatization', 'quite', 'opposite', 'documentary', 'do', 'not', 'pretend', 'otherwise', 'do', 'not', 'have', 'enough', 'source', 'material', 'draw', 'get', 'better', 'picture', 'events', 'real', 'Pancho', 'Villa', 'films', 'have', 'been', 'lost', 'history.The', 'movie', 'very', 'loosely', 'based', 'story', 'American', 'film', 'company', 'reciving', 'offer', 'Mexican', 'revolutionary', 'general', 'Pancho', 'Villa', 'film', 'real', 'life', 'battle', 'would', 'be', 'first', 'time', 'history', 'battle', 'was', 'be', 'shown', 'film', 'public', 'general', 'somehow', 'felt', 'theatrical', 'presentation', 'Mexican', 'conflict', 'could', 'cause', 'America', 'consider', 'lifting', 'embargo', 'ability', 'buy', 'American', 'guns', 'battle', 'footage', 'well', 'enough', 'received', 'company', 'return', 'actors', 'crew', 'flesh', 'out', 'movie', 'Villa', 'needed', 'side', 'story', 'told', 'Rupert', 'Murdoch', 'day', 'form', 'WR', 'Hearst', 'newspaper', 'empire', 'was', 'editorializing', 'spinning', 'news', 'affect', 'public', 'policy', 'demonize', 'General.The', 'film', 'very', 'well', 'made', 'battle', 'exciting', 'authentic', 'costumes', 'sets', 'vintage', 'vehicles', 'are', 'very', 'authentic', 'actors', 'take', 'roles', 'seriously', 'great', 'effort', 'put', 'forth', 'make', 'as', 'believable', 'possible', 'Antonio', 'Banderas', 'mesmerizing', 'tough', 'role', 'Villa', 'one', 'hand', 'gentle', 'friendly', 'raging', 'next', 'moment', 'Alan', 'Arkin', 'role', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'more', 'developed', 'much', 'more', 'role', 'called', 'rest', 'cast', 'keep', 'up', 'as', 'can', 'are', 'not', 'as', 'bad', 'make', 'sound', 'here', 'just', 'outclassed.All', 'was', 'pleasant', 'diversion', 'evening']",And Starring Pancho Villa As Himself

It introduced me to a remarkable if not astonishing incident in film history and history in general -- but one that has become unknown. This film is quite adequate or solid in its acting and production values.The writer/producer's commentary is in the top 10% with plenty of appropriate and thoughtful information on the subject itself instead of the usual hype and self congratulations and ha-ha-ha remember this and that.On the other hand, if you are not intrerested very much in the history or Mexico or film making beyond the technical aspects then this may not grab you. It does not follow tightly the usual formula for suspense and drama in action storytelling. It is not an ordinary action flick or western.The actual silent film that was made during the revolution about and including Villa, the most expensive film ever made up to that time, has been lost, as have been so many early films. So if you have a serious interest in history you will understand that the details in the film cannot stand for a documentary. There has to be a lot of fill-in and interpretation. Anyone with a serious interest in history will want to use the film as a yeast starter and go out and gather their own ingredients from academic sources and come up with their own best approximation of how this astonishing project back during the revolution might have played out in detail. There are a lot of good leads in the commentary as to the actual detailed facts of the project.

When I saw the PBS documentary, &#34;The Storm that Swept Mexico,&#34; I wanted to learn more about this history of Mexico. Being from Texas, I had always grown up hearing about Pancho Villa but had no opinion nor interest since it seemed like a long time ago and not of my country. Little did I know that Mexico almost allied with Germany for a deal that would have included taking back Texas!I wanted to know more about Pancho Villa since Mexican Politicians tried to wipe out references to him after Villa's death. I bought a PBS-like documentary of Mr. Villa but it was in Spanish. Sorry, no comprendo. I understood, poquito, that Pancho was good, yet bad. I bought a (used) book by Nellie Campobello written as in the eyes of a child -- and absolutely hated the book and started to develop the opinion that Pancho Villain (sic) muy malo.Then I remembered that in both the PBS and Mexican documentaries there was mention of the DW Griffith movie, starring Pancho Villa himself. Neither iTunes nor Netflix had the movie to rent so I did the next best thing: I bought a Used copy on Amazon!!!I'm giving it 5 stars. I liked it. Do you like the current type of Westerns? True Grit? Desperado?The movie is totally entertaining, lots of action, lots of things blowing up. The horse riding action is some of the best I've seen. Antonio Banderas does a great acting job even if he can't get ugly enough to look like the real Pancho. The movie does portray the good, the bad, and the ugly of Pancho Villain.I'm done. I got my history lesson satisfied by watching this movie. I realize it isn't an exact biography but it is as good a story as you're going to get about Pancho Villa. It was beautiful to &#34;history&#34; in color, see the scenery of Mexico, the old fashioned train with the Soldaderas (female soldiers) riding on top, the haciendas, references to wealthy foreign land owners, American interest in Mexico's oil, the costumes, media propaganda, and the beautiful faces of the Mexicans who still, today, profile their indigenous ancestry.My used copy from Amazon, listed as &#34;Used - Good&#34; was in perfect condition.

The fact that the events really happened makes for a somewhat comical and unbelievable story, and overall very interesting because it is true. Eventually though, the story gets told, but the movie does not end.Antonio Banderas was superb, and when his character is not featured for the last part of the movie, the quality of the movie suffers. He delivers the right combination of joker and heartless tough guy while maintaining a leadership quality.
