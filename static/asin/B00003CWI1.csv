517390,A1GSR7RGCG1QYZ,B00003CWI1,"A. Gyurisin ""good friend, damn fool""","[6, 20]","What happened in this film? I couldn't tell you. One of the major downfalls of this film was the lack of quality that was used to transfer this film to DVD.  I felt at times that I was watching a very old VHS version of this film. There is even a moment where you get squiggle lines at the top of the screen as if you are watching this film on a rackety VHS player.  The fade in's and fade out's were horribly miscalculated.  I am always a believer that you should let your character finish his/her line or action before you go to a fade, that way you don't have audience members straining to hear or to catch a final glimpse of what is happening.I am trying really hard to watch some of these older films.  They are the backbone to modern cinema ... but can't they be any better.  I am still waiting for me to discover that gem.  I think that is my mission now.  I want to see an older film that is virtually unheard of, but is movie making at its best.So, what was wrong with Beat the Devil you may ask?  The fades were one aspect I had trouble getting over.  Another was what the director was trying to do with Bogart.  Trying to enjoy the spoof that the director, John Houston, was planting in the film was hard.  What Houston was trying to do was spoof all of Bogart's prior films.  This movie was like all of Bogart's films meshed together so to speak.  While you don't normally see this in many movies (the only one that comes to mind is True Lies with Arnie), in this film it was done so badly that the humor was lost to confusion.  This was one of those films that you have to watch, and your initial reaction is going to be the true feeling that you have for this film.  I thought about re-watching this film to see if it got any better for me, but as I thought about it, I had to pass.My initial reaction was not good, and I had this feeling deep in me that it wasn't going to get much better with a second viewing.  Maybe I was expecting better, I mean Truman Capote wrote the film ... that should mean something ... right?Finally, and perhaps I just need to see more of them, but I have trouble watching a satire without any jokes. Growing up in the era of Mel Brooks, I wanted scenes and words that I would just fall over with laughter about.  This film carried none of this.  There was only one scene that made me smile a bit (and perhaps it was because my throat was dry), and that was when Bogart's buggy went down the cliff and into the ocean. The only reason for me laughing at that was because it reminded me of Hawaii and our trip up a huge mountain!! Blach!

517392,AGEIT17HENDIS,B00003CWI1,Alfred Johnson,"[2, 2]","When Humphrey Bogart was in his prime, say from the time of  Petrified Forest in the late 1930s until say 1947's Dark Passage, he was hands down king of film noir hill. No question. There were prettier faces (Clark Gable), there were better actors (Spenser Tracey), there were actors with more angst per ounce (Montgomery Cliff) but for sheer gritty, grizzled, gnarly (nice, huh) film presence Bogie was the one. Of course even those who have not kept up with their history know that every king (or queen) has his (or her) day. And then-done. Well, not exactly done but since actors, like some generals, only fade away and hang on for just as long as studios think they have ""start"" quality to put in the bank. In the film under review, Beat The Devil, our man Bogie is in such a quandary. Clearly, on the screen, it is almost painful to see his physical decline (only slightly hidden by ""make-up magic"") if not his ability to throw off a few off-hand devil take the hinter-post lines in this one.Fortunately this film, directed skillfully to enhance the black and white features, by John Huston, is not desperately in need of ""high"" Bogie to carry it along. The story line, about a motley crew of ""desperados"" seeking fame and fortune in post-World War Africa is fairly straight forward and mundane. Unfortunately, for them, they are stuck in an out-of the-way port in Italy. The keys to the kingdom that this crew is trying to corner in the heated up Cold War world- uranium (or some other equally precious commodity, if thinks turn out badly). If in earlier times gold or diamonds stirred men's (and women's) greedy thoughts just then in that red scare night it was that particularly important produce.  However not for one moment can any of the parties (and those like Ms. Jones and her down-at-the-heels British husband who wonder what this crew is doing out in the sticks) take one eye much less two off the others. And that, more than the thin plot line, is what carries the day here. The collective day, with likes of Robert Benchley, Peter Lorre and Ms. Jones, playing off against Bogie's world-wary, world-weary performance. Add into the mix a little off-hand infidelity for the good of the cause and that makes a very interesting mix. If you need classic ""high"" Bogie then go to Casablanca, To Have or Have Not or The Big Sleep. But if you want to see him play against type and in an ensemble performance watch this one.",3,Tick-Tock Time,1325289600,"12 31, 2011",2011,2431,"['When', 'Humphrey', 'Bogart', 'was', 'prime', 'say', 'time', 'Petrified', 'Forest', 'late', '1930s', 'say', '1947', 'Dark', 'Passage', 'was', 'hands', 'down', 'king', 'film', 'noir', 'hill', 'question', 'were', 'prettier', 'Clark', 'Gable', 'were', 'better', 'actors', 'Spenser', 'Tracey', 'were', 'actors', 'more', 'angst', 'ounce', 'Montgomery', 'Cliff', 'sheer', 'gritty', 'grizzled', 'gnarly', 'nice', 'huh', 'film', 'presence', 'Bogie', 'was', 'one', 'course', 'even', 'who', 'have', 'not', 'kept', 'up', 'history', 'know', 'king', 'queen', 'day', 'then-done', 'Well', 'not', 'exactly', 'done', 'actors', 'generals', 'only', 'fade', 'away', 'hang', 'just', 'as', 'long', 'studios', 'think', 'have', 'start', 'quality', 'put', 'bank', 'film', 'review', 'Beat', 'Devil', 'man', 'Bogie', 'such', 'quandary', 'Clearly', 'screen', 'almost', 'painful', 'see', 'physical', 'decline', 'only', 'slightly', 'hidden', 'make-up', 'magic', 'not', 'ability', 'throw', 'off', 'few', 'off-hand', 'devil', 'take', 'hinter-post', 'lines', 'one.Fortunately', 'film', 'directed', 'skillfully', 'enhance', 'black', 'white', 'features', 'John', 'Huston', 'not', 'desperately', 'need', 'high', 'Bogie', 'carry', 'along', 'story', 'line', 'motley', 'crew', 'desperados', 'seeking', 'fame', 'fortune', 'post-World', 'War', 'Africa', 'fairly', 'straight', 'forward', 'mundane', 'Unfortunately', 'are', 'stuck', 'out-of', 'the-way', 'port', 'Italy', 'keys', 'kingdom', 'crew', 'trying', 'corner', 'heated', 'up', 'Cold', 'War', 'world-', 'uranium', 'other', 'equally', 'precious', 'commodity', 'thinks', 'turn', 'out', 'badly', 'earlier', 'times', 'gold', 'diamonds', 'stirred', 'men', 'women', 'greedy', 'thoughts', 'just', 'then', 'red', 'scare', 'night', 'was', 'particularly', 'important', 'produce', 'However', 'not', 'one', 'moment', 'can', 'parties', 'Ms.', 'Jones', 'down-at-the-heels', 'British', 'husband', 'who', 'wonder', 'what', 'crew', 'doing', 'out', 'sticks', 'take', 'one', 'eye', 'much', 'less', 'two', 'others', 'more', 'thin', 'plot', 'line', 'what', 'day', 'here', 'collective', 'day', 'likes', 'Robert', 'Benchley', 'Peter', 'Lorre', 'Ms.', 'Jones', 'playing', 'off', 'Bogie', 'world-wary', 'world-weary', 'performance', 'Add', 'mix', 'little', 'off-hand', 'infidelity', 'good', 'cause', 'very', 'interesting', 'mix', 'need', 'classic', 'high', 'Bogie', 'then', 'go', 'Casablanca', 'Have', 'Have', 'Not', 'Big', 'Sleep', 'want', 'see', 'play', 'type', 'ensemble', 'performance', 'watch', 'one']",N/A
517393,A3NQU1649SH0Q4,B00003CWI1,"Allen Smalling ""Eclectic Reader,""","[4, 4]",".This amusing movie with a considerable following was penned by Truman Capote and is more or less a pastiche of the kinds of Hollywood genre movies he grew up watching, with an emphasis on droll dialogue. It has to do with the search for treasure in Africa -- sort of -- but also to watch is the interplay between an arch British couple, some scurrilous guys including the wonderful Peter Lorre, a disastrous steamship voyage and even a local Arab chieftan with a letch for Rita Hayworth.  Not to mention that Humphrey Bogart's character is married to Gina Lollobrigida and all the actors act in clashing styles ranging from drawling to frenetic to brittle, which introduces a note of camp and places BEAT THE DEVIL in the late-night cult pantheon.BEAT THE DEVIL is well worth enjoying if you want something casual and witty.  This is not a classic of Hollywood construction and economy by any means, though.  At one point in the movie (you will know when), a modified version of the 'Cavalry coming over the hill' is sent to arrest the treasure hunters -- but rescue Capote's plot.  Also, film critic Louis Gianetti (whose UNDERSTANDING MOVIES is the biggest-selling American film-course intro), maintains that this is one of Bogart's weakest roles, because Bogey was uncomfortable with the kind of high arch comedy the movie required.  Maybe so.  At this price, though, and despite any imaging defects, this is a film well worth trying out and well worth having.

I didn't want to, I just wanted to buy a decent DVD version. O boy! There isn't any. And it's not only the quality that is lacking, its the content. All you get is the US recut of Huston's film (1954, 89', not 1953, 100'). It really changes the character of the movie.

A man they pass turns round to stare at them  unpleasently. They turn round (towards each other).2 Portrait shot of six small boys looking very ugly, glaring at them. Mouth movements as if  they were about to spit.3 The couple turns again, resuming their walk.EU: I must say I do resent the way these people stare at us.

You were only a child then.JJ: She wasn't a child. She was old.EU: I only wonder why your parents left you in charge of such a dirty, ignorant woman.JJ: They cared for nothing except to have me off their hands. I told you that. They'd have sold  me on the slave market if they hadn't been afraid of the scandal. Besides my father was  incompetent.

517402,A2FOT0QE23VN6J,B00003CWI1,Dr. James Gardner,"[4, 6]","""Beat the Devil"" is a tongue in cheek spoof of Bogart's famous films of the 40s, like ""The Maltese Falcon"" and ""Casablanca"". It comes in 1953 near the end of Bogart's career. Although he still had a few good films left ahead (e.g., ""The Caine Mutiny""), generally speaking his best years were behind him, and his performance in this film ranks among his lesser roles, exacerbated by the fact that he had been in a major auto accident during production (there is one scene near the end of the film when his injuries were not adequately covered up by the makeup).Bogart made 80 films, was nominated 3 times for an Oscar and won for ""The African Queen"" (1952), and is considered the greatest male actor of the 20th Century by many. His list of outstanding performances is too long to list. Director John Huston said of him - ""He was endowed with the greatest gift a man can have -- talent.""Bogart has his long time friend Peter Lorre (1904-64) along for the ride. They did 5 films together, beginning with ""The Maltese Falcon"" (1941). In addition to his work with Bogart, Lorre is most famous for his terrifying role in ""M"" (1931) and his ""Mr. Moto"" films. Director John Huston said of him -"" Peter Lorre was one of the finest and most subtle actors I have ever worked with. Beneath that air of innocence he used to such effect, one sensed a Faustian worldliness.""Lorre is joined by fat and jolly Robert Morley (1908-1992) instead of his usual partner in crime, fat and jolly Sydney Greenstreet who retired in 1949 for health reasons, and died in 1954. Morley was a wonderful actor, a lovable pompous windbag who graced film and stage. He was nominated for an Oscar for his film debut in ""Marie Antoinette"" (1938) playing a shy Louis XVI, and was nominated for a Golden Globe for ""Who's Killing the Great Chefs of Europe"" (1978), but personally I thought his best performance was as the missionary in ""The African Queen"" (1951) with Bogart. Incredibly, this film was the only pairing of Morley and Lorre.The two female stars are Jennifer Jones and Gina Lollobrigida. Jones (1919-2009) was a terrific actress and was nominated 5 times for an Oscar, winning for ""A Song of Bernadette"" (1943). Her best work was in the 40s (""Since You Went Away"", ""Duel in the Sun"", ""Portrait of Jennie"") but she continued to work and was nominated for a Golden Globe for her final film, ""The Towering Inferno"" in 1974. Jones is a riot as the wife of a pretentious Englishman, and she steals every scene in which she appears.Gina Lollobrigida (1927) is simply beautiful. One can hardly get past her beauty and enjoy her good acting in this film, which was her breakout role. She gave good performances in films like ""Trapeze"" (1956) and ""Never so Few"" (1959) before her film career went into decline.Look for Bernard Lee (1908-81) in a brief appearance as an inspector from Scotland Yard. Lee would later gain fame playing ""M"" in the early James Bond films.Director John Huston (1906-87) apparently conceived of the idea for this film as a spoof of his previous films like ""The Maltese Falcon"". Huston was one of our best directors, nominated 5 times for an Oscar for directing, winning once for ""Treasure of the Sierra Madre"" (1948) that starred Bogart and Huston's father, Walter Huston (who won his only Oscar as Best Supporting Actor). Huston was also nominated 8 times for an Oscar for writing, and once for acting.  This was his last of 6 films with Bogart.Huston co-wrote this film (as he did with many of his films) with Truman Capote (1924-84). Capote was best known as a writer of novels (""Breakfast at Tiffanys"", ""In Cold Blood""). ""Beat the Devil"" was his first of two screenplays he wrote, and he got the job because of his work with Jones' husband, David O Selznick, on ""Indiscretion of an American Wife"" (1953).Despite the quality of the actors and the director and writer, this is an unsatisfying film. It lacks a solid base. Clearly it isn't meant to be taken at face value (a thriller), but nor is it very funny (like ""We're No Angels"") or even sly (like ""The Lavender Hill Mob""). The original novel was a thriller and it was Huston's desire to turn it into a comedy, but it ends up being neither. Bogart himself disliked the film, said ""only phonies like it"", and his production company (Santana Productions) failed to renew the copyright. The NY Times said -  ""A potential treat emerged as a wet firecracker"" and ""For all the studiedly suave professionalism, though, Beat the Devil ends up beating itself.""There are some good things about this film. Jennifer Jones is terrific. Supporting performances by Ivor Bernard (the homicidal Major) and Mario Perrone (ship's purser) are brilliant, and there is the occasional plot point that will get a rise. But all things considered this is a monumental waste of talent that could have created a much better work.Some reviewers will claim that it is a great film, a camp film, a cult film, etc. Perhaps. I'm sure the film will appeal to a small group of people, but generally speaking, if it failed at the box office, failed at the Oscars, and was trash talked by the people who were involved in it, chances are most people aren't going to enjoy it. Fans of the actors have so many better films they can choose from, why would you waste your time on this failed attempt?",2,Failed attempt,1302998400,"04 17, 2011",2011,5308,"['Beat', 'Devil',

A Solinas ""ea_solinas""","[4, 5]","You'd think that ""Beat the Devil"" would be far better known than it is, since it was one of the last movies that Humphrey Bogart did before his untimely death.Maybe it's because Bacall wasn't in it, or maybe it was just too quirky for the masses. But taken for its own merits, this movie is a delicious little gem -- a funny, wry noir-satire, with a gang of rather inept criminals. Bogart does a fair amount of scenery-chewing, but a number of big stars of the time -- including Peter Lorre, Jennifer Jones and Gina Lollabrigida -- get plenty of good time.Billy Dannreuther (Bogart) is part of a motley group planning to go to Africa, where a friend can help them illegally claim uranium, enabling them to become insanely rich forever. But trouble arrives: stuffy Harry Chelm (Edward Underdown) and his very imaginative, compulsively-lying wife Gwen (Jennifer Jones) arrive, and soon they're flirting with Billy and his sensual wife Maria (Gina Lollabrigida).Even worse, Gwen's ""exaggeration"" habit is making the gang distrust Billy, thinking that he's withholding information from them and cheating them out of a fair share. He isn't, of course. But all the personal plots and distrust come to a boil when everyone boards the ship, and Harry reveals that he knows everything about their uranium plot. Now Billy has to save himself and his friends, without Harry being bumped off...""Beat the Devil"" is an all-around satire -- it mocks grabby criminals, pathological liars, stodgy Brits, romance movies, crime capers, noir films, and even second-rate boats in less advanced corners of the world (""Of course, the captain is drunk!""). In fact, there's very little about this movie that doesn't poke fun at itself, or at the movies of the time.And since it was adapted by John Huston and Truman Capote, you know that it's being witty as it makes fun. It languidly builds up in a sunny, dusty, ruined city where people plot and flirt, and then starts to boil when they get on board the crummy little boat. But even engine failures manage to be entertaining when Harry wrecks the oil pump while trying to fix it, and preening about his English know-how.The cast is skilled in that under-the-radar way, where nobody hogs the spotlight. Humphrey Bogart plays a slightly more offbeat version of his noir characters. He's a lot smarter than anyone would immediately suspect, a lot nicer than you'd think, and he handles most of the awkward situations with mildly tolerant grace.Other well-known actors of the time make deliciously offbeat appearances -- Jones is hilarious as the ditzy, chattery English girl, Lollabrigida is suitably slinky and grasping, and Peter Lorre plays an uncharacteristically hapless conman. Robert Morley are also quite good as Bogie's bombastic pal, and Underdown plays the insensitive, straight-arrow dunce perfectly. You'll constantly want to smack him.Though not as respected as it deserves, ""Beat the Devil"" is a little gem of a Bogart movie, with witty, satirical writing, deliciously offbeat acting and lots of wild twists.

He isn't, of course. But all the personal plots and distrust come to a boil when everyone boards the ship, and Harry reveals that he knows everything about their uranium plot. Now Billy has to save himself and his friends, without Harry being bumped off...""Beat the Devil"" is an all-around satire -- it mocks grabby criminals, pathological liars, stodgy Brits, romance movies, crime capers, and even second-rate boats (""Of course, the captain is drunk!""). In fact, there's very little about this movie that doesn't poke fun at itself, or at the movies of the time.And since it was adapted by John Huston and Truman Capote, you know that it's being witty as it makes fun. It languidly builds up in a sunny, ruined city where people plot and flirt, and then starts to boil when they get on board the boat. But even engine failures manage to be entertaining when Harry wrecks the oil pump while trying to fix it.The cast is skilled in that under-the-radar way: Bogart plays a slightly more offbeat version of his noir characters, and Jennifer Jones is hilarious as the ditzy, chattery English girl. Peter Lorre and Robert Morley are also quite good as Bogie's pals, and Underdown plays the insensitive, straight-arrow dunce perfectly.

517408,ACIBQ6BQ6AWEV,B00003CWI1,"Gary F. Taylor ""GFT""","[19, 21]","Humphrey Bogart heads a superior cast in this tale of a gang of swindlers who seek to covertly purchase African lands rich in uranium--but this is not the tough film noir you might expect: the script by director John Huston and Truman Capote upends the tale to create one of the most wry and wicked comedies going, and a remarkably fine cast follows suit with a host of eccentric performances.Although Bogart does not look his best (this film was made toward the end of his life), he offers an understated yet very witty performance as Billy Dannreuther, the man the crooks hire to make the land purchase.  His leading ladies, bombshell Gina Lollobrigida and an unexpectedly blonde Jennifer Jones, are equally effective in the roles of Bogart's cheerfully pragmatic wife and the pathological liar with whom Bogart becomes romantically entangled.  But the big news in this film is the supporting cast. Robert Morley, Peter Lorre, Ivor Barnard, and Marco Tulli give drop-dead-funny performances as the largely incompetent foursome behind the landsnatch scheme; Edward Underdown (as Jones' long suffering husband) is simply the most completely ludicrous Brit to hit the screen since 1930s screwball comedy; and all the cameo players nail their roles to perfection.It would be unforgivable to give away too much of the story, but suffice to say that one wrong turn leads to another.  But the film never overplays its hand, maintaining a low key tone that sets off the wickedly funny script to delightful effect.  Some viewers may not get the joke--much of BEAT THE DEVIL requires the ability to appreciate covert humor--but those who do will find the movie bears repeat viewing.

If you don't find it on Amazon, you may have to search the Web for this edition.1953 critics and audiences alike, anticipating a serious drama, missed the point of this noir-satire that delightfully lampooned the genre.  While bombing at the box office, it eventually became a cult classic when audiences realized they were supposed to have as much fun viewing it as the actors had in making it.  Knowing about the stormy frustrations and dysfunctions that went on behind-the-scenes makes viewing even more enjoyable.The principle stars seem to delight in portraying the on-screen personas and stereotypes for which they were already famous.

Gina Lollobrigida brings her predictable fiery Latin-tempered performance to the screen, along with her paparazzi-hounded cleavage.  Despite his bizarre bleach-blond buzz cut, Peter Lorre remains true to the character spoofed by so many impersonators on the Ed Sullivan Show.

Beat The Devil stars Humphrey Bogart as a shady business man dealing with equally shady people who hope to purchase a piece of property in Africa filled with uranium. To try and pin down a genre for this film would be a very trying issue. It's humor is so off beat and subtle, not many would consider it a comedy. Sometimes in treads in the territory of thriller but the thrills are not that suspenseful. I think the film simply relies on the strength of it's actors and that's why it shines. Humphrey Bogart, as usual, a charasmatic presence and a man about town with a dry sense of humor.  Robert Morley is pretty much the epitome of the comical, english snob but is remarkably dignified when he needs to be. The rest of Morley's crew range from a philosophical Peter Lorre to a facist and hot headed facist ex British Major. This isn't an all male affair with Gina Lollobrigida providing the sex appeal and Jennifer Jones as the personification of this very off beat film; Her imagination adds much to the film and pays off for the surprise ending.

517437,A3RNP5X8ZGZIEI,B00003CWI1,Stephanie De Pue,"[2, 2]","""Beat the Devil,"" a 1953 release, is a 173 minute action/adventure/comedy, with a very distinguished list of talent before and behind the camera.  It was produced by its principal star, Humphrey Bogart, (Casablanca,The Maltese Falcon).  He was, of course, the American actor and cultural icon; in 1997, Entertainment Weekly magazine named him the number one movie legend of all time. In 1999, the American Film Institute ranked him as the greatest male star.  The picture was quite popular at the time of its release; it was considered a witty, dry-humored spoof of the caper films that were then in vogue.  But its popularity has slipped somewhat, and, oddly enough, according to the Internet, it was allowed to fall into the public domain.  And that, I guess, accounts for its many inferior quality DVD releases out there, with muddy picture and sound.  The version I saw comes with another film on a disk that can be bought amazingly cheaply at various places.  And, criminally enough, it comes without subtitles, for a film once noted for its witty script.A quartet of international crooks - Peterson (popular British comic actor Robert Morley,Murder at the Gallop), O'Hara (Peter Lorre, CASABLANCA, THE MALTESE FALCON), Major Jack Ross (Ivor Bernard) and Ravello -- is stranded in Italy while their ocean-going steamer is being repaired. The Dannreuthers. Billy (played by Bogie), and Maria (played by Italian beauty Gina Lollobrigida,Buona Sera, Mrs. Campbell), meet them at a shabby Italian port. The six are headed for Africa, supposedly to sell vacuum cleaners but actually to buy land rumored to be loaded with uranium. They are joined in the port by another, British couple also waiting for the ship, the Chelms.  Gwendolen is a constantly irritating confirmed liar who also blurts out the truth at inconvenient moments.  She is played by the Oscar-winning Jennifer Jones, (The Song of Bernadette), who looks odd as a blond.  And Harry.  Later on, in Africa, Scotland Yard Inspector Jack Clayton, sent out to the Dark Continent to track down something else entirely, accidentally trips over the gangster foursome.  He's played by Bernard Lee (""M"" in the earlier James Bond movies), who apparently despaired of playing a steady diet of cops and the like.  Most of the film's other stars play out their accustomed stereotypes as well, with Lorre as a nervous little illegal alien type; Morley as the pompous, blustering Englishman, Lollobrigida as the gorgeous Italian (what a reach).  Though Bogart is surely too old, and wearing his pants too high, to be a sex symbol in this one.For the life of me, I don't know why Bogart would have paid to do exteriors on location in Italy, and then filmed in black and white, but he did.  There are other oddities.  I don't quite get the way the two married couples flirted with each others' spouses: perhaps it was considered sophisticated back then.  The four gangsters sit down to play cards, and it sure sounds like a game of bridge: not what you would expect of them, with its steep learning curve, though perhaps they learned it while incarcerated.  At one point in the movie, Lollobrigida's character takes a fall and hits her head; she's obviously been injured, but the movie never acknowledges it.  Be that as it may, Bogart does get good support in the acting department.  But the film is very slow in getting started; in fact some viewers may think it never does.  And yes, there is a subtle black humor running through it, for those who can catch it--without subtitles, Lollo's dialog is almost incomprehensible.  What a waste, considering the comic brains that put the script together.The film is based on the book of the same name by James Helyick: it is considered by many critics to follow the novel more closely than usual, and uses the original names of most of the characters.  According to the Internet, the first screenplay was written by one ""James Neville,"" a pseudonym for the late Claud Cockburn, who was blacklisted at the time.  (The Communist Claud Cockburn was the father of the recently-deceased humorous columnist Alexander Cockburn.)  At any rate, the ten times Oscar nominated John Huston, (THE MALTESE FALCON,The Treasure of the Sierra Madre,The Man Who Would Be King,The African Queen), legendary director of the film, apparently didn't care for Cockburn's take and tossed it.  He called in Truman Capote, who was living in Rome at the time. Capote was an American writer whose short stories, novels, plays, and non-fiction are recognized literary classics, including the novellaBreakfast at Tiffany's(1958), andIn Cold Blood(1965), both filmed, as were 20 of his works.  Eventually Huston himself would collaborate on the screenplay, as would two other well-known screenwriters, Anthony Veiller, and Peter Viertel.  Well, the movie was made by some talented hands, but can't recommend it, unfortunately.",2,"Once Very Popular, Many Inferior Copies Out There",1353974400,"11 27, 2012",2012,4888,"['Beat', 'Devil',

These are all top people. Little roles, like the chauffeur, and the sea captain are perfectly cast with european actors that way outmatch american actors in their abilities.. The script is filled with double meanings, and without a doubt, there is one line said by Robert Morley that got by the censors only because it was so sophisticated. It has something to do with being a gentleman....Don't ever miss a Huston film, especially with Bogart. This is great fun, and you should know that by now.

Their agent is Billy (Humphrey Bogart) a man who is a ""typical rare spirit."" His wife is Maria (Gina Lollobrigida). They meet a British couple who are also on their way to Africa. Gina falls for the husband Harry (Edward Underdown) while Harry's wife  Gwendolen (Jennifer Jones) falls for Billy. They are stranded in Italy as the boat is in need of repairs and the captain is always full of spirits.Jennifer Jones steals this film as a fast thinker with an over active imagination who is prone to lying in every situation. The dialouge, in part written by Truman Capote, reflects national stereotypes that translate into today's world as well as clever oxymorons, mispronounced words and misused phrases. It is film in which you want to pay close attention to the words. The bad guys are quite the lot. Peter Lorre plays Julius O'Hara, claiming ""There are a lot of German O'Hara's from Chile."" Maj. Jack Ross (Ivor Barnard) spouts off his love for Hitler and Mussolini along with wild conspiracy ideas.

517441,A3AHMJQWK00LTQ,B00003CWI1,"Zino Davidoff ""zino""","[75, 78]","Beat the Devil is a subtle comedy of manners. It's not a big Hollywood film, but a small independent (Bogart's own production company) that happens to have an amazing cast, is directed by one of the best (John Huston), with a Truman Capote screenplay. It's become one of my favorite off-beat films and can't recommend it enough.What's not to like? Quite a bit if you read some of the disgruntled reviews below! But don't be dissuaded, it's a gem. And remember, Pauline Kael was a huge fan of this movie; if she's a reviewer you trust, that might be enough for you.Other reviewers have outlined the plot so I won't go into that, and in any case, that's not the reason to watch this movie. The plot's certainly as good as any amusing Hitchcock film, with its MacGuffin and several surprising twists and comic suspense subplots unraveling throughout.There are subtleties to Beat the Devil that apparently escape many reviewers, who perhaps wanted another formulaic 'noir' classic or some kind of slapstick laff-fest. If you like New Yorker cartoons, you'll likely enjoy this movie as much as I do: I've watched this movie at least 5 times and still love it.Beat the Devil escapes categorization, except to say that it's a brilliant comic screenplay performed with skill and insight by several of the best actors of the 50s. Robert Morley is sublimely funny, and brings out the best in Peter Lorre and the other criminals in the gang.Jennifer Jones is sexy and charming in her role as a compulsive liar, as is her classic and earnestly doltish husband. They reek naive British charm and are marvelous together, providing a poignant tension in contrast to the gang of conniving scoundrels.Bogart himself has one foot in each boat, and much of the film revolves around the conflict he suffers in this double life, playing each off the other. As in most Bogie flicks, he's hilariously dry and sly, with lollapalooza actress Gina Lollobrigida playing his scheming wife. Everyone's on the make except Harry Chelm, Jennifer Jones' character's husband.There isn't the passion of a Bogie/Bacall film, and it's not the classic noir we all love with Bogart, so don't be disappointed.One word of warning: Beat the Devil slipped into the public domain, so the DVDs on the market are of varying quality. The one I have is ok, but only just... it's like watching an old movie, with herky jerky pops and cuts and some noise. It doesn't bother me that much though, and emphasizes the 'rare find' quality if you're feeling charitable. If you're a digital maniac, you'll be better served watching something Criterion's had its way with.Beat the Devil is one of the most unusual 50s movies I can think of, and I don't normally watch any movie as often as I've watched this one.
