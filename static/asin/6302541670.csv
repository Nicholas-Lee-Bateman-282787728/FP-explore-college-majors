319398,ACPXNYGPXPKED,6302541670,David N. Brown,"[0, 0]","This is a review specifically for the online video of ""Here Comes Garfield"".  It's an impressive example of vintage TV animation.  What's entirely unsatisfactory is the sound quality of Amazon's offering.  For some reason, the dialogue is very quiet, even muffled, even at volumes where the music and sound effects get uncomfortably loud.  It's hard to say what went wrong, or when:  Maybe it's a problem with how the recording plays back; maybe it's an issue of how different tracks were preserved; it might even be that the original dialogue recordings were subpar.  Whatever the reasons, it's a thoroughly disappointing and even unpleasant experience.David N.

Garfield gets his Halloween inspiration to trick-or-treat from that ""awful clown"" Binky. The next morning he wakes up saying, ""Candy, candy, candy, candy, candy, CANDY, CANDY! Hello, Halloween! What a glorious day and a glorious night to go trick-or-treating...for candy, candy, candy, candy, CANDY!"" He and Odie, who gets the inspiration passed from Garfield, pick out their costumes for the night. They dress as swash-buckling buccaneers. After a sucessful night, they discover a dock on a lake with a small lifeboat attached to the boat. They sail across the lake. After sialing into a patch of fog, Garfield realizes they're lost and wants to go back home. Suddenly, land ho! They discover a rickety old mansion. As they quietly make their way inside and sit by the fire, they turn around and see a spooky-looking and mysterious old man seated in a chair. He tells them of an old pirate legend about how 100 years ago on that night they buried treasure somwhere on that island, and 100 years later they would return to get it...even if it meant returning from the grave! Garfield and Odie decide to leave and notice the man is gone. Out of the house they run and see the old man stole their boat. At midnight, an eerie looking ghost pirate ship arrives. Close-ups with pirate ghosts and escaping adventure as Garfield and Odie evacuate the mansion, swim the lake back to the other side. They see their boat, and leave with their candy. Back home , they each get their share of the candy. Garfield turns on the TV and sees the old man saying in an Alfred Hitchcock voice, ""Good evening, and welcome to the all-night pirate movie festival."" Garfield turnd it off saying, ""Boy, am I tired."" He lays down and says in his pirate voice ""Arrr..."" It's no trick, but it's one Halloween treat.

Bernabo,"[3, 3]","If there is one thing that kids are going to pick up from animated Thanksgiving specials featuring their favorite cartoon and comic strip characters it is going to be that cooking a Thanksgiving dinner is hard work (which would explain why the kids are parked in front of the television watching parades and animated Thanksgiving special featuring their favorite cartoon and comic strip characters while mom is in the kitchen doing the hard work and dad is staying out of the way watching football).  This lesson is amply illustrated in &quot;Garfield's Thanksgiving,&quot; where Jon (voice of Tom Huge) is in charge of doing the turkey with all the trimmings, which, you know, is never going to work (even with the magic counter).  Meanwhile, a bad situation is made even worse when Garfield (Lorenzo Music) is forced to go on a diet just as Turkey Day is approaching.  Throw Odie (Gregg Berger) and Dr. Liz Wilson (Julie Payne) into the mix and it is a good thing that Grandma (Pat Carroll) will be around to save the day.  All things considered, this is one of the funnier Thanksgiving animated specials and is a good bet to make the kiddies giddy.  However, as always, parents will have to watch this one at least once to explain who Orson Welles was and other jokes that are going to go right over the heads of the kiddies.  Note: Actress Julie Payne is the daughter of John Payne (&quot;Miracle on 34th Street&quot;) and Anne Shirley (formerly Dawn O'Day, who changed her name to Anne Shirley to play Anne Shirley in &quot;Anne of Green Gables&quot;).",5,Turkey Day is coming but Garfield is forced to go on a diet,1069632000,"11 24, 2003",2003,1557,"['one', 'thing', 'kids', 'are', 'going', 'pick', 'up', 'animated', 'Thanksgiving', 'specials', 'featuring', 'favorite', 'cartoon', 'comic', 'strip', 'characters', 'going', 'be', 'cooking', 'Thanksgiving', 'dinner', 'hard', 'work', 'would', 'explain', 'why', 'kids', 'are', 'parked', 'front', 'television', 'watching', 'parades', 'animated', 'Thanksgiving', 'special', 'featuring', 'favorite', 'cartoon', 'comic', 'strip', 'characters', 'mom', 'kitchen', 'doing', 'hard', 'work', 'dad', 'staying', 'way', 'watching', 'football', 'lesson', 'amply', 'illustrated', 'quot', 'Garfield', 'Thanksgiving', 'quot', 'where', 'Jon', 'voice', 'Tom', 'Huge', 'charge', 'doing', 'turkey', 'trimmings', 'know', 'never', 'going', 'work', 'even', 'magic', 'counter', 'Meanwhile', 'bad', 'situation', 'made', 'even', 'worse', 'when', 'Garfield', 'Lorenzo', 'Music', 'forced', 'go', 'diet', 'just', 'Turkey', 'Day', 'approaching', 'Throw', 'Odie', 'Gregg', 'Berger', 'Dr.', 'Liz', 'Wilson', 'Julie', 'Payne', 'mix', 'good', 'thing', 'Grandma', 'Pat', 'Carroll', 'will', 'be', 'save', 'day', 'things', 'considered', 'one', 'funnier', 'Thanksgiving', 'animated', 'specials', 'good', 'bet', 'make', 'kiddies', 'giddy', 'However', 'always', 'parents', 'will', 'have', 'watch', 'one', 'least', 'once', 'explain', 'who', 'Orson', 'Welles', 'was', 'other', 'jokes', 'are', 'going', 'go', 'right', 'heads', 'kiddies', 'Note', 'Actress', 'Julie', 'Payne', 'daughter', 'John', 'Payne', 'quot', 'Miracle', '34th', 'Street', 'quot', 'Anne', 'Shirley', 'formerly', 'Dawn', ""O'Day"", 'who', 'changed', 'name', 'Anne', 'Shirley', 'play', 'Anne', 'Shirley', 'quot', 'Anne', 'Green', 'Gables', 'quot']",N/A
