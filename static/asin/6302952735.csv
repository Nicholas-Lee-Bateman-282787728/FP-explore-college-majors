Based on the Anton Chekhov short story, Cleese plays Smychkov, a double bass player commissioned to play at a ball for Princess Constanza (Booth.) Cleese arrives early for the ball, and after being taunted by a castle employee decides to go for a swim. Unbeknownst to him, the princess decides for an au naturel dip in the lake as well. After a thief steals their clothes they are in a highly embarrassing predicament. Cleese's plan involves many risks and much adventure, but is a comic delight.Cleese and Booth are wonderful together, and despite the short running time and subpar image quality (flaws abound in this print) their chemistry makes the story work. It shouldn't be compared to &#34;Monty Python&#34; or &#34;Fawlty Towers&#34; as this is far less surreal with a much more straightforward narrative, but it stands the test of time as an oddly sweet and slightly tawdry (naughty bits abound) short film that fans of Cleese and Booth will love.",4,"""I Am An Artist, Not A Fishmonger!""",1404086400,"06 30, 2014",2014,1109,"['ever', 'wanted', 'see', 'John', 'Cleese', 'skinny', 'dipping', 'top', 'hat', 'see', 'Connie', 'Booth', 'running', 'hither', 'yon', 'nothing', 'tiara', 'must', 'see', 'Based', 'Anton', 'Chekhov', 'short', 'story', 'Cleese', 'Smychkov', 'double', 'bass', 'player', 'commissioned', 'play', 'ball', 'Princess', 'Constanza', 'Booth', 'Cleese', 'arrives', 'early', 'ball', 'being', 'taunted', 'castle', 'employee', 'decides', 'go', 'swim', 'Unbeknownst', 'princess', 'au', 'naturel', 'dip', 'lake', 'as', 'well', 'thief', 'clothes', 'are', 'highly', 'embarrassing', 'predicament', 'Cleese', 'plan', 'many', 'risks', 'much', 'adventure', 'comic', 'delight.Cleese', 'Booth', 'are', 'wonderful', 'together', 'short', 'running', 'time', 'subpar', 'image', 'quality', 'flaws', 'abound', 'print', 'chemistry', 'story', 'work', 'should', ""n't"", 'be', 'compared', '34', 'Monty', 'Python', '34', '34', 'Fawlty', 'Towers', '34', 'far', 'less', 'surreal', 'much', 'more', 'straightforward', 'narrative', 'test', 'time', 'oddly', 'sweet', 'slightly', 'tawdry', 'naughty', 'bits', 'abound', 'short', 'film', 'fans', 'Cleese', 'Booth', 'will', 'love']",N/A

347329,ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T,6302952735,Tsuyoshi,"[5, 6]","After quitting `Monty Python's Flying Circus' in 1973, John Cleese went on to create his best work in his career so far - actually the best comedy ever made in the history of the world. That is `Fawlty Towers,' incredibly funny comedy about the worst hotel and its delightfully arrogant owner Basil Fawlty. It is regrettable that they only made 12 episodes.`A Romance with a Double Bass,' shot in 1974, prior to the 1st six episodes of `Fawlty,' is NOT the unreleased 13th episode about Basil and Polly though it features three of the actors seen in this landmark comedy, and contains some funny moments. You also should not expect the craziness of Monty, such as Cleese doing silly walk. No, it is a love story, and John Cleese means it ... even though he is stark naked.Based on Chekhov's short story, `A Romance with a Double Bass' opens with double bass player Smychkov (Cleese) arriving at the Russian palace where a betrothal ball is going to be held. As he arrived too early on a hot summer's day, he decides to take a bath in a lake nearby, little knowing that the Princess (Booth) has done the same.Things get complicated (and funny) when a passing thief takes away the clothes of the both. Chivalrous Smychkov promises the distraught Princess to bring her back safely to the palace like a true gentleman. Luckily, the thief didn't steal the double bass case. in which the naked Princess can hide.Their misadventure results in the unexpected romance of the two, which is the most charming of the film. John Cleese and Connie Booth (then married) manage to show enough chemistry between them to convince us of the budding romance in spite of the short running time of the film.This 40 minute film may sound like an extended sketch from `Monty Python' at first, but John Cleese and Connie Booth (both credited as writer) are obviously trying to make the film not too silly. The behaviors of both characters, funny as they are, are always based on the reasonable motives, so you will never see a dead parrot or flying sheep here.Additional fun is the appearance of Andrew Sachs as musician, who was later cast as Manuel in `Fawlty Towers.' The film also has British character actor Freddie Jones, and is directed by Robert Young, the original director of `Fierce Creatures' starring John Cleese.For all its background, `A Romance with a Double Bass' should be enjoyed out of the context of two leading actors' careers. Don't try to find any `Monty' sketch nor `Fawlty Towers' episode. It is a romance from a Russian writer, Anton Chekhov, master of storytelling, and this charming adaptation well-reflects the fact.",5,Dead Parrot Not Included: Charming Tale About the Princess and the Musican (Both Naked),1156636800,"08 27, 2006",2006,2621,"['quitting', 'Monty', 'Python', 'Flying', 'Circus', '1973', 'John', 'Cleese', 'went', 'create', 'best', 'work', 'career', 'so', 'far', 'actually', 'best', 'comedy', 'ever', 'made', 'history', 'world', 'Fawlty', 'Towers', 'incredibly', 'funny', 'comedy', 'worst', 'hotel', 'delightfully', 'arrogant', 'owner', 'Basil', 'Fawlty', 'regrettable', 'only', 'made', '12', 'episodes.', 'Romance', 'Double', 'Bass', 'shot', '1974', 'prior', '1st', 'six', 'episodes', 'Fawlty', 'NOT', 'unreleased', '13th', 'episode', 'Basil', 'Polly', 'three', 'actors', 'seen', 'landmark', 'comedy', 'funny', 'moments', 'also', 'should', 'not', 'expect', 'craziness', 'Monty', 'such', 'Cleese', 'doing', 'silly', 'walk', 'No', 'love', 'story', 'John', 'Cleese', 'even', 'stark', 'naked.Based', 'Chekhov', 'short', 'story', 'Romance', 'Double', 'Bass', 'opens', 'double', 'bass', 'player', 'Smychkov', 'Cleese', 'arriving', 'Russian', 'palace', 'where', 'betrothal', 'ball', 'going', 'be', 'held', 'arrived', 'too', 'early', 'hot', 'summer', 'day', 'take', 'bath', 'lake', 'nearby', 'little', 'knowing', 'Princess', 'Booth', 'done', 'same.Things', 'get', 'complicated', 'funny', 'when', 'passing', 'thief', 'away', 'clothes', 'Chivalrous', 'Smychkov', 'distraught', 'Princess', 'bring', 'back', 'safely', 'palace', 'true', 'gentleman', 'Luckily', 'thief', 'did', ""n't"", 'steal', 'double', 'bass', 'case', 'naked', 'Princess', 'can', 'hide.Their', 'misadventure', 'results', 'unexpected', 'romance', 'two', 'most', 'charming', 'film', 'John', 'Cleese', 'Connie', 'Booth', 'then', 'married', 'manage', 'show', 'enough', 'chemistry', 'convince', 'budding', 'romance', 'spite', 'short', 'running', 'time', 'film.This', '40', 'minute', 'film', 'may', 'sound', 'extended', 'sketch', 'Monty', 'Python', 'first', 'John', 'Cleese', 'Connie', 'Booth', 'credited', 'writer', 'are', 'obviously', 'trying', 'make', 'film', 'not', 'too', 'silly', 'behaviors', 'characters', 'funny', 'are', 'are', 'always', 'based', 'reasonable', 'motives', 'will', 'never', 'see', 'dead', 'parrot', 'flying', 'sheep', 'here.Additional', 'fun', 'appearance', 'Andrew', 'Sachs', 'musician', 'who', 'was', 'later', 'cast', 'Manuel', 'Fawlty', 'Towers', 'film', 'also', 'British', 'character', 'actor', 'Freddie', 'Jones', 'directed', 'Robert', 'Young', 'original', 'director', 'Fierce', 'Creatures', 'starring', 'John', 'Cleese.For', 'background', 'Romance', 'Double', 'Bass', 'should', 'be', 'enjoyed', 'context', 'two', 'leading', 'actors', 'careers', 'Do', ""n't"", 'try', 'find', 'Monty', 'sketch', 'Fawlty', 'Towers', 'episode', 'romance', 'Russian', 'writer', 'Anton', 'Chekhov', 'master', 'storytelling', 'charming', 'adaptation', 'fact']",N/A
