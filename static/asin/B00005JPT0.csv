656861,ANCOMAI0I7LVG,B00005JPT0,Andrew Ellington,"[5, 10]","I really wanted to like this movie.  I generally love John Cusack and with the high profile year he's had this year (why oh why did `Grace is Gone' not translate into an Oscar nomination?) I thought that `Martian Child' might be the place to go.  Besides, it also stars my other favorite Cusack (Joan that is) and so it was high on my list of films to rent as soon as available.  Sadly, `Martian Child' proves to be nothing more than sentimental fluff that milks the heartstrings in a saccharine and at times annoying kind of way.  It's a very forced kind of sentiment; like they tried to hit you over the head with everything they could to persuade your feelings in their direction.  The result is a forgettable and in moments a regrettable film that could have and should have been better.The story is that of David, a successful science fiction writer who is mourning the death of his wife.  His wife, having been adopted herself, had wanted to adopt a child and David was determined to carry out her wishes even though he felt that kind of commitment was too much for him at the moment.  He winds up being paired up with Dennis, a strange child who believes he's from Mars.  Being that science fiction is his forte, David feels that he can appeal to Dennis' issues and find the root of his delusions.  His approach is looked down on by board that placed Dennis in his custody and so both David and Dennis will have to learn to `grow up' together if they want to stay together.This reminds me of the Kevin Spacey vehicle `K-Pax' except `K-Pax' actually got to me in the end.  I felt a connection there that I didn't feel here, maybe because the whole `alien' aspect of `K-Pax' (or I guess I should say that the reasons behind the `alien' aspect of `K-Pax') was at least explored deeper than it is here.  Similarities abound between Coleman's Dennis and Spacey's Prot, the difference being that Spacey knows how to sell it (but I'll get to that in a minute).John Cusack does a decent job here.  It's not his finest moment but he adds layers of believability to David that I admired.  You really feel that he loves this kid even if the script itself makes that hard to believe.  Joan Cusack (who just makes ANY movie worth watching) chews some scenery here and truly is the highlight of the film.  Amanda Peet is really here in name and body only; she doesn't really do a whole lot.  I'm not even sure who she really was.The biggest mistake of this film though is Bobby Coleman, the little boy who plays Dennis.  I hate doing this because he's such a young kid and I feel mean saying this but he really botched this.  He comes across annoying and very unnatural.  Child actors are really one of two scenarios.  You have your Haley Joel Osment's who are just blisteringly talented, and then you have your Bobby Coleman's, who need to learn the art of acting.  His `acting' is forced.  You can tell he's trying to play `strange' as apposed to just `being' strange.  I'm forced to recall the effortlessness with which Osment played the outcast in `The Sixth Sense' or the way he maneuvered through very adult emotions in `A.I.' and even `Pay it Forward' and wonder to myself why they wouldn't have found a kid with his talent level to play young Dennis.  In all seriousness, the sappy condition of this film could have been forgiven had Coleman delivered a memorable performance.In the end `Martian Child' misses, which is a sad thing since it had all the potential to be a moving and inspiring film.  It has some moments that are tender but those moments are crowded out by the rest of this film.  There is a thin line between an emotional resonant picture and a force-fed emotional disaster.  Sometimes less is more, and more often than not it's better to let your audience slowly fall in love with you because they want to, not because you demand them to.",2,I was looking for something out of this world; sadly that's not what I got...,1204502400,"03 3, 2008",2008,3856,"['really', 'wanted', 'like', 'movie', 'generally', 'love', 'John', 'Cusack', 'high', 'profile', 'year', 'had', 'year', 'why', 'oh', 'why', 'did', 'Grace', 'Gone', 'not', 'translate', 'Oscar', 'nomination', 'thought', 'Martian', 'Child', 'might', 'be', 'place', 'go', 'Besides', 'also', 'other', 'favorite', 'Cusack', 'Joan', 'was', 'high', 'list', 'films', 'rent', 'as', 'soon', 'available', 'Sadly', 'Martian', 'Child', 'proves', 'be', 'nothing', 'more', 'sentimental', 'fluff', 'heartstrings', 'saccharine', 'times', 'annoying', 'kind', 'way', 'very', 'forced', 'kind', 'sentiment', 'tried', 'hit', 'head', 'everything', 'could', 'persuade', 'feelings', 'direction', 'result', 'forgettable', 'moments', 'regrettable', 'film', 'could', 'have', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'better.The', 'story', 'David', 'successful', 'science', 'fiction', 'writer', 'who', 'mourning', 'death', 'wife', 'wife', 'having', 'been', 'adopted', 'had', 'wanted', 'adopt', 'child', 'David', 'was', 'determined', 'carry', 'out', 'wishes', 'even', 'felt', 'kind', 'commitment', 'was', 'too', 'much', 'moment', 'up', 'being', 'paired', 'up', 'Dennis', 'strange', 'child', 'who', 'Mars', 'Being', 'science', 'fiction', 'forte', 'David', 'can', 'appeal', 'Dennis', 'issues', 'find', 'root', 'delusions', 'approach', 'looked', 'down', 'board', 'placed', 'Dennis', 'custody', 'so', 'David', 'Dennis', 'will', 'have', 'learn', 'grow', 'up', 'together', 'want', 'stay', 'together.This', 'reminds', 'Kevin', 'Spacey', 'vehicle', 'K-Pax', 'K-Pax', 'actually', 'got', 'end', 'felt', 'connection', 'did', ""n't"", 'feel', 'here', 'maybe', 'whole', 'alien', 'aspect', 'K-Pax', 'guess', 'should', 'say', 'reasons', 'alien', 'aspect', 'K-Pax', 'was', 'least', 'explored', 'deeper', 'here', 'Similarities', 'abound', 'Coleman', 'Dennis', 'Spacey', 'Prot', 'difference', 'being', 'Spacey', 'how', 'sell', ""'ll"", 'get', 'minute', '.John', 'Cusack', 'decent', 'job', 'here', 'not', 'finest', 'moment', 'layers', 'believability', 'David', 'admired', 'really', 'feel', 'kid', 'even', 'script', 'hard', 'believe', 'Joan', 'Cusack', 'who', 'just', 'ANY', 'movie', 'watching', 'scenery', 'here', 'truly', 'highlight', 'film', 'Amanda', 'Peet', 'really', 'here', 'name', 'body', 'only', ""n't"", 'really', 'do', 'whole', 'lot', ""'m"", 'not', 'even', 'sure', 'who', 'really', 'was.The', 'biggest', 'mistake', 'film', 'Bobby', 'Coleman', 'little', 'boy', 'who', 'Dennis', 'hate', 'doing', 'young', 'kid', 'feel', 'mean', 'saying', 'really', 'botched', 'annoying', 'very', 'unnatural', 'Child', 'actors', 'are', 'really', 'one', 'two', 'scenarios', 'have', 'Haley', 'Joel', 'Osment', 'who', 'are', 'just', 'blisteringly', 'talented', 'then', 'have', 'Bobby', 'Coleman', 'who', 'need', 'learn', 'art', 'acting', 'acting', 'forced', 'can', 'tell', 'trying', 'play', 'strange', 'apposed', 'just', 'being', 'strange', ""'m"", 'forced', 'recall', 'effortlessness', 'Osment', 'played', 'outcast', 'Sixth', 'Sense', 'way', 'maneuvered', 'very', 'adult', 'emotions', 'A.I', 'even', 'Pay', 'Forward', 'wonder', 'myself', 'why', 'would', ""n't"", 'have', 'found', 'kid', 'talent', 'level', 'play', 'young', 'Dennis', 'seriousness', 'sappy', 'condition', 'film', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'forgiven', 'had', 'Coleman', 'delivered', 'memorable', 'performance.In', 'end', 'Martian', 'Child', 'misses', 'sad', 'thing', 'had', 'potential', 'be', 'moving', 'inspiring', 'film', 'moments', 'are', 'tender', 'moments', 'are', 'crowded', 'out', 'rest', 'film', 'thin', 'line', 'emotional', 'resonant', 'picture', 'force-fed', 'emotional', 'disaster', 'Sometimes', 'less', 'more', 'more', 'often', 'not', 'better', 'let', 'audience', 'slowly', 'fall', 'love', 'want', 'not', 'demand']",N/A

Not that THE MARTIAN CHILD isn't a good film, it's just not science fiction.Based on the true life story of science fiction author David Gerrold's experience adopting a challenging child who believes he's from Mars, this story is a family drama that tugs at heart-strings and gives us a fine performance by child actor Bobby Coleman.John Cusack (Grace Is Gone) pulls in an equally fine performance as David Gerrold, the sci-fi author who eventually adopts Dennis (Coleman). Finding him in a box at the adoption center, David (Cusack) coaxes him out of his walled-in life and into the real world. But it takes time and strength to do it, and David wonders if he has the fortitude and abilities to bring Dennis all the way. Dealing with parenting as a single parent, David discovers the additional difficulties of having a son so different than every other child. Dennis wears weight belts (to keep him from floating away), needs an umbrella to shield him from the sun (because Earth is much closer to it than his home planet, Mars), and his significant dietary requirements (Lucky Charms ...although not explained would make sense since they contain star shapes, etc.).The story is told well if not predictably. The engaging portions are those surrounding Dennis' conversion from alien to human after the slow realization that David won't be letting go of him (""Why did my parents let me go?""). The significance of the weight belt (to keep him from floating away like his real parents) and the umbrella (to shield him from persecution by those the same age) are set up and knocked down with adequate dramatic flair.But there are no science fiction elements whatsoever. Similar in tone toK-Pax, this story focuses on the people and their mental flaws. It tells us, in no uncertain terms, that being human is okay; that we don't have to be from somewhere else in order to be unique and wanted and understood.No spaceships. No time travel. No green skinned creatures.

Crawford ""danielc_1978""","[63, 66]","Being a single guy myself, looking into the adoption process of becoming a father of a special needs (older/behavioral) child, I was excited about this movie coming out. I have always believed that we need more movies such as this one that shows adopting an older child and single adoption in a good light. There are many older kids such as the one displayed in the movie that need homes. I know this because I am also a child therapist and I work with many of them. What I liked about the movie is how it shows what truly a single man goes through when trying to adopt. I have an older sister just like the one in the movie. Everything that Cusack's sister said to him, my sister said to me. ""These older kids have problems, why would you want to deal with that?"" she has stated to me. Also how the system looks at a single man not worthy or strange to want to raise kids is there also. It's sad we live in a society in which men are not suppose to love kids... unless they are his own or unless they are on the football field or something. The lack of positive male role models is one thing that is damaging our society.The missing part of the movie that I thought could have made it better is I was expecting the kid to have been more difficult... displaying behavior that would have made it harder to love him. The little guy in the movie was easy to love. That's what didn't make sense to me. He was very socially odd; however, his behavior was not all that bad. I don't understand why a therapeutic foster home or family couldn't handle him. He wasn't aggressive physically or verbally and didn't have any of the significant issues such as self injurious or sexually acting out behavior. He was just a very neglected, possibly abused child that lived in a fantasy world in order to cope with his reality. Also I didn't understand why the so called mental health experts in the movie thought this behavior was abnormal taking into account that the kid was abandoned and likely abused. It is very common for severely abused and neglected children to live in a fantasy world. I can't count the number of group home kids I have worked with that stated that their mother just bought them an xbox360 or something else great and I know they don't even have parents. It's easier to make up false stories about being loved than to live with the reality of not being wanted. Also I wish there were more heart felt moments in the movie. The ones that were in the movie were basically ruined by watching the trailer.Also I have read many reviews stating that the end of the movie was terrible. I thought the last scene when Cusack told the boy how important and special he is was the best part of the movie. That scene made the movie! There are many, many kids who need to hear what Cusack said to that boy. Most people who don't have any experience working with unwanted children may think that scene was corny, however those who do have experience working with or being one of those kids, that scene was perfect. Great movie however just a little under five stars!By the way, to totally appreciate this movie you have to look at it as a pure drama and not science fiction. Watch the movie with the understanding that unwanted, abused and abandoned kids make up fantasy stories in order to cope with their reality and the so called ""science fiction"" part of the movie will make more sense. Also take into account that an adoption process takes at least a year. All of these ""sappy"" moments could have EASILY happened in a year time frame.This movie could also be used in group therapy for foster kids as a way to get them to express themselves about their current issues. Many foster and adopted kids have experienced many of the same situations the young boy in the movie faced. The movie is good to use to start a discussion and explore feelings and help kids gain awareness about themselves... just a thought.",4,"Movie displays ignored subject in our society..

A big three-stars.I enjoy what John Cusack brought to the role (vulnerability, sensitivity, quiet contemplation etc...). But, his spot-on portrayal of a widower dealing with a psychologically damaged child could not save the film as a whole.The ""K-Pax"" grumblings here hold true. I remember thinking that this film was treading an awfully thin line ... precariously teetering to the side of plagiarism. The sunglasses (!!!), the seemingly extraordinary abilities, the alien language (inclusive of the ""click consonant""), the use of stellar maps, the disappearing acts, the picnic scene ... and that's just the beginning. Yes, the similarities are uncomfortable. But then, something else was nagging at me ... and, I realized what it was when the adoptive father realized (too late) he could not allow his eccentric child to wear whatever he wanted/be whomever he wanted. This was ""Big Daddy"" ... inclusive of gross food-scenes and abandonment issues. (Believe me, you will notice!) A weird amalgamation of films, but true enough.Now, I realize this film is an adaptation of David Gerrold's ""The Martian Child: A Novel About A Single Father Adopting A Son."" And, here's the thing: Gerrold's work is great, but this film is a mediocre translation. (And, inventing a dead wife ... well, why? Why not just tell the true story as Gerrold told it? Very frustrating. And, adding Amanda Peet to the equation is even more bizarre ... considering the reality of the situation.)So, while I genuinely did laugh and I genuinely did feel compassion for Cusack's character, it just was not enough for me to recommend this film.

Following the formula to a tee, the two then struggle to understand each other for the rest of the picture before feeling their way to a generic happy ending, complete with montage. The film halfheartedly drops sporadic hints that the child might be from outer space as he so boldly proclaims, but never seems to completely commit to that direction. Instead, it's content to just lean back into an easy, overplayed routine and let the chips fall where they may. Really, the narration is so passive it's hard to imagine what it does stand for - even the shoehorned introduction of a love interest for Cusack (a heavily criticized change from the novella, in which the narrator is gay) is just lightly dangled across the screen before being tossed aside and forgotten.

I have enjoyed MARTIAN CHILD since it was new, so much so that I never thought to review it. So here it is!Little Dennis (a delightful Bobby Coleman) is a youngster with a problem: he is from Mars, and Earth scares him a great deal. He hides in an old delivery box (was that an AMAZON box?) fearing the sun will burn him to a crisp. He stays in an orphanage that seems to handle him well. Adoption attempts have not been kind to him.Not a cornflakes-box kid, to be sure.Enter famous author David Gordon (John Cusack), a weird, never-say-grow-up single man who pines for a kid of his own. The two stars collide, and magic results. Dennis the Martian, who is a genius with synesthesia and apparently Asperger's autism, comes to be cherished by David...but Dennis wants to 'go home' to Mars. Well, he's not Prot from K-PAX and David soon finds his hands very full.A good supporting cast must be well used before it makes/breaks a film. That is done well here, with Oliver Platt as Jeff, David's literary agent, and a cameo by Angelica Huston as a pushy producer is a refreshing breeze.Finally, a word about the group GUSTER and its amazing soundtrack: oops, I already said it, amazing.

656887,AC4Z26E60FBEM,B00005JPT0,Fr. Charles Erlandson,"[4, 4]","Maybe if I'd come to this movie cold without what I had experienced for the 4 days immediately prior to watching it, I would have dismissed it as a typical movie with a typical Hollywood happy ending.Other reviewers have written about the basic plot, etc., so I want to challenge you to watch this movie with new eyes. For the 4 days before experiencing this movie I was at a conference for young Anglicans (the Anglican Way Institute), at which the theme was ""Marriage and Family for the Kingdom."" In particular, we had just heard a series of brilliant lectures on parenting, and I had gone to a workshop discussing Pope John Paul II's incredible ""Theology of the Body.""When I watched ""Martian Child"" 2 days ago, the themes of God and His love, what it means to be made in the image of God, and the nature of Christian parenting jumped out at me! I've rarely had a movie-going experience as powerful as having watched ""Martian Child."" Movies have a powerful ability to teach and transform us, but this potential is rarely achieved. ""Martian Child"" is one film that reaches at least some of the potential power of film.I challenge you, if you're a Christian (or even if you're not) to watch ""Martian Child"" through the lens of what it means to be a human: made in the image of God, which means made to live in a harmonious relationship of love with someone who is other than you and different from you. Look at it as a primer on parenting - not that I think that the father, David (played by John Cusack), did everything right. But that itself is the reality of parenting. Look for how self-giving love is what heals Dennis, the ""Martian Child"" abandoned in real life by his human parents, and makes him ""human"" again.As a parent of 5, a school teacher, and a priest, I've made it my life's work to study how to love. ""Martian Child"" taught me or reminded me of a lot what I'm supposed to be doing in order to love and truly reflect the image and love of God.One of the most important things David says to Dennis, more than once, is that he will ""never ever ever . . . "" let him go. And he doesn't. He keeps pursuing Dennis with an unconditional love, even when Dennis steals and hides important things (like keys and driver's licenses) and runs away.The movie makes a subtle but powerful statement about the utterly destructive nature of parents abandoning their children, whether through divorce or psychologically. And it's not just about parent-child love but all love. Any time we humans abandon each other and live out of selfishness, other people and we ourselves get hurt.I like the way that ""Martian Child"" honestly arrives at its happy ending because it was cinematically and psychologically earned as the father manifested unconditional love to a child under a series of difficult circumstances. ""Martian Child"" showed the way the father had to love the Martian child no matter what, how he had to enter into his world, and how he had to shepherd him gently to the truth and to reality. Part of loving Dennis meant challenging his self-destructive self-deception (but understandable as an act of self-preservation) that he really was from Mars.In summary, the movie's theme is well communicated by this exchange between David and Dennis:David: Why did they send you here? You know, the Martians?Dennis: To join a family and to learn human beingness.The final words, spoken by David, also help us remember what we've just witnessed and what has hopefully now become a part of us:""Sometimes we forget that children have just arrived on the earth. They are a little like aliens, coming into beings as bundles of energy and pure potential, here on some exploratory mission and they are just trying to learn what it means to be human. For some reason Dennis and I reached out into the universe and found each other, Never really know how or why. And discovered that I can love an alien and he can love a creature. And that's weird enough for both of us.""It's unfortunate that ""Martian Child"" is not a more well-known movie. But I'm glad that someone introduced it to me and hope this review can introduce it to others.",5,"A Film About Being Human, Which is Living in Self-Giving Love",1310342400,"07 11, 2011",2011,4124,"['Maybe', ""'d"", 'come', 'movie', 'cold', 'what', 'had', 'experienced', '4', 'days', 'immediately', 'prior', 'watching', 'would', 'have', 'dismissed', 'typical', 'movie', 'typical', 'Hollywood', 'happy', 'ending.Other', 'reviewers', 'have', 'written', 'basic', 'plot', 'etc.', 'want', 'challenge', 'watch', 'movie', 'new', 'eyes', '4', 'days', 'experiencing', 'movie', 'was', 'conference', 'young', 'Anglicans', 'Anglican', 'Way', 'Institute', 'theme', 'was', 'Marriage', 'Family', 'Kingdom', 'particular', 'had', 'just', 'heard', 'series', 'brilliant', 'lectures', 'parenting', 'had', 'gone', 'workshop', 'discussing', 'Pope', 'John', 'Paul', 'II', 'incredible', 'Theology', 'Body', 'When', 'watched', 'Martian', 'Child', '2', 'days', 'ago', 'themes', 'God', 'love', 'what', 'be', 'made', 'image', 'God', 'nature', 'Christian', 'parenting', 'jumped', 'out', ""'ve"", 'rarely', 'had', 'movie-going', 'experience', 'as', 'powerful', 'having', 'watched', 'Martian', 'Child', 'Movies', 'have', 'powerful', 'ability', 'teach', 'transform', 'potential', 'rarely', 'achieved', 'Martian', 'Child', 'one', 'film', 'least', 'potential', 'power', 'film.I', 'challenge', ""'re"", 'Christian', 'even', ""'re"", 'not', 'watch', 'Martian', 'Child', 'lens', 'what', 'be', 'human', 'made', 'image', 'God', 'made', 'live', 'harmonious', 'relationship', 'love', 'someone', 'who', 'other', 'different', 'Look', 'primer', 'parenting', 'not', 'think', 'father', 'David', 'played', 'John', 'Cusack', 'did', 'everything', 'right', 'reality', 'parenting', 'Look', 'how', 'self-giving', 'love', 'what', 'heals', 'Dennis', 'Martian', 'Child', 'abandoned', 'real', 'life', 'human', 'parents', 'human', 'again.As', 'parent', '5', 'school', 'teacher', 'priest', ""'ve"", 'made', 'life', 'work', 'study', 'how', 'love', 'Martian', 'Child', 'taught', 'reminded', 'lot', 'what', ""'m"", 'supposed', 'be', 'doing', 'order', 'love', 'truly', 'reflect', 'image', 'love', 'God.One', 'most', 'important', 'things', 'David', 'Dennis', 'more', 'once', 'will', 'never', 'ever', 'ever', 'let', 'go', ""n't"", 'pursuing', 'Dennis', 'unconditional', 'love', 'even', 'when', 'Dennis', 'steals', 'hides', 'important', 'things', 'keys', 'driver', 'licenses', 'away.The', 'movie', 'subtle', 'powerful', 'statement', 'utterly', 'destructive', 'nature', 'parents', 'abandoning', 'children', 'divorce', 'psychologically', 'not', 'just', 'parent-child', 'love', 'love', 'Any', 'time', 'humans', 'abandon', 'other', 'live', 'selfishness', 'other', 'people', 'ourselves', 'get', 'hurt.I', 'way', 'Martian', 'Child', 'honestly', 'happy', 'ending', 'was', 'cinematically', 'psychologically', 'earned', 'father', 'manifested', 'unconditional', 'love', 'child', 'series', 'difficult', 'circumstances', 'Martian', 'Child', 'showed', 'way', 'father', 'had', 'love', 'Martian', 'child', 'matter', 'what', 'how', 'had', 'enter', 'world', 'how', 'had', 'shepherd', 'gently', 'truth', 'reality', 'Part', 'loving', 'Dennis', 'meant', 'challenging', 'self-destructive', 'self-deception', 'understandable', 'act', 'self-preservation', 'really', 'was', 'Mars.In', 'summary', 'movie', 'theme', 'well', 'communicated', 'exchange', 'David', 'Dennis', 'David', 'Why', 'did', 'send', 'here', 'know', 'Martians', 'Dennis', 'join', 'family', 'learn', 'human', 'beingness.The', 'final', 'words', 'spoken', 'David', 'also', 'help', 'remember', 'what', ""'ve"", 'just', 'witnessed', 'what', 'hopefully', 'now', 'become', 'part', 'forget', 'children', 'have', 'just', 'arrived', 'earth', 'are', 'little', 'like', 'aliens', 'coming', 'beings', 'bundles', 'energy', 'pure', 'potential', 'here', 'exploratory', 'mission', 'are', 'just', 'trying', 'learn', 'what', 'be', 'human', 'reason', 'Dennis', 'reached', 'out', 'universe', 'found', 'other', 'Never', 'really', 'know', 'how', 'why', 'discovered', 'can', 'love', 'alien', 'can', 'love', 'creature', 'weird', 'enough', 'unfortunate', 'Martian', 'Child', 'not', 'more', 'well-known', 'movie', ""'m"", 'glad', 'someone', 'introduced', 'hope', 'review', 'can', 'introduce', 'others']",N/A

656891,A328S9RN3U5M68,B00005JPT0,Grady Harp,"[67, 74]","MARTIAN CHILD was marketed incorrectly - that can be the major reason for its lack of success in the theatrical release.  While all the multiplex theaters are overflowing with loud, coarse, raunchy, and special effects driven financial successes (with major exceptions, of course!), little meaningful and sensitive films such as this are submerged and don't last long.  Should the name of the film have been different? Should the advertisements been better designed? Who knows, but for those who now have the opportunity to buy or rent MARTIAN CHILD, there is a special experience in store.Based on the novel 'The Martian Child' by David Gerrold (beautifully adapted for the screen by Seth Bass and Jonathan Tolins), Director Menno Meyjes has gathered an exceptional cast to present this story about human needs and how we all find security in the warmth of other caring beings.  David (John Cusack) is a successful science fiction writer who is a widower, still grieving for his wife.  His agent Jeff (Oliver Platt), his sister Liz (Joan Cusack) and his wife's best friend Harlee (Amanda Peet) aid his 'convalescence', but David feels the need for a child.  When social worker Sophie (Sophie Okonedo) calls David concerning an available  strange little boy Dennis (Bobby Coleman) who believes he is from the planet Mars and hides inside a box, covered with sunscreen and dark glasses, David responds: he, after all, writes science fiction and is attracted to the idea that Dennis believes he is here from Mars on a mission. Against the advice of his practical sister, David agrees to take Dennis home, feeling that he is one of the few who can relate to Dennis' behavior.Life at home is not easy, but with time David and Dennis bond and Dennis comes out of his box to become 'normal'.  It is the prolonged journey on which David and Dennis embark that holds the meat of the story. Dennis has been deserted as a small child and  finds security in believing he is a visiting Martian who will be 'taken home' to Mars when his mission to understand human beings is complete. David's persistent parenting (quoting Churchill's 'Never ever, ever ,ever, ever, ever give up'), while tested to the extreme, results in a bonding with Dennis that is heart wrenchingly beautiful.  And how each of the characters' lives is changed by this extraordinary relationship brings the film to a touching close.In addition to the fine performances by both Cusacks, Peet, Platt, and Okonedo, there are brief but noteworthy cameos by Anjelica Huston and Richard Schiff among others.  This is a film that makes a major statement  about parenting and single parenting in particular and does so with kindness, tenderness, and sincere emotion.  Please see this film.

Adopting a child was something they considered before she passed but David isn't sure his heart is up to it. That all changes when he meets a unique young boy named Dennis (Bobby Coleman) who believes he is from Mars. David adopts Dennis believing that he can help cure the pain that has caused Dennis to retreat into his own alternate universe. What David doesn't anticipate is how much light Dennis will in turn bring to his world.Martian Child is a simple movie with a powerful message about hope, love and acceptance.  While this story idea is nothing new, Cusack and Coleman bring a new level of freshness to familiar territory. Cusack always brings a strong performance and he is certainly believable in his role as a single dad. Without a doubt the star of the film is the Martian Child himself, Bobby Coleman. This is an incredible performance that will tug at your heart strings and warm your soul. Amanda Peet and Joan Cusack also lend strong supporting roles to the well-rounded cast.My wife and I were in the initial stages of adoption when we found out we were pregnant with our little girl. Since then adoption has always been close to our hearts and something we are considering for the future.

Oddly both books these movies were based on came out at roughly the same time.That similarity aside, this was a wonderful movie all around.  Two lost people (weirdos really) finding each other and the love of 'family' in a very unconventional way.John Cusack does a great job of presenting a believable bumbling dad wanna-be, and as we watch him jump through the hoops of adoption I often thought to myself that ALL parents should have to be vetted as much.Soft spoke Bobby Coleman is achingly cute as 'the martian child' and for a young actor he took direction very well.  His cool, almost unbreaking demeanor throughout the film exemplifies the detachment children form under such circumstances as being abandoned, emotionally abused and hesitant about opening their hope and hearts to new family.If nothing else, I would recommend this movie to folks considering adoption because it does a brilliant and endearing job of showing the viewer of just how easy it is to love another 'being' whether there are blood-ties or not.",4,Touching film about the ties that bind,1234656000,"02 15, 2009",2009,1163,"['Martian', 'Child', 'was', 'unexpected', 'surprise', 'me.I', 'REALLY', 'enjoyed', 'movie', 'save', 'fact', 'REALLY', 'reminded', 'K-Pax', 'Oddly', 'books', 'movies', 'were', 'based', 'came', 'out', 'roughly', 'same', 'similarity', 'aside', 'was', 'wonderful', 'movie', 'around', 'Two', 'lost', 'people', 'weirdos', 'really', 'finding', 'other', 'love', ""'family"", 'very', 'unconventional', 'way.John', 'Cusack', 'great', 'job', 'presenting', 'believable', 'bumbling', 'dad', 'wanna-be', 'watch', 'jump', 'hoops', 'adoption', 'often', 'thought', 'myself', 'parents', 'should', 'have', 'be', 'vetted', 'much.Soft', 'spoke', 'Bobby', 'Coleman', 'achingly', 'cute', ""'the"", 'martian', 'child', 'young', 'actor', 'took', 'direction', 'very', 'well', 'cool', 'almost', 'unbreaking', 'demeanor', 'film', 'detachment', 'children', 'form', 'such', 'circumstances', 'being', 'abandoned', 'emotionally', 'abused', 'hesitant', 'opening', 'hope', 'hearts', 'new', 'family.If', 'nothing', 'else', 'would', 'recommend', 'movie', 'folks', 'considering', 'adoption', 'brilliant', 'endearing', 'job', 'showing', 'viewer', 'just', 'how', 'easy', 'love', ""'being"", 'are', 'blood-ties', 'not']",N/A

Having adopted and raised a child with special needs myself, I was amazed that a preposterous movie like this could ever get made, let alone be based on a true story.

My loss!As someone who watches wholesome movies, I can say that this film was quite refreshing. Of course, just being a wholesome movie alone isn't going to make it a five star film for me, but this movie has big names and a great story to help make this a tremendous production.Ultimately, this is the story about an emotionally disturbed boy and a needy widower who work to try and make a father-son relationship work out. The boy thinks he is from Mars, and his bizarre actions cause him to be a constant outcast, but his new dad loves him in spite of it all. I really don't know how much more can be said without spoiling anything, but I really want to emphasize that this needs to be watched through to the end. The kid can really be annoying in his fantasy world, but in the end it all kind of makes sense.While I can't really relate to the specific characters in the movie, I found it to be quite an enjoyable (and realistic) view on the human emotions. If the viewer happens to relate on any level with the two main characters, I'm sure this might instantly rank as a favorite and likely a tear jerker.If you don't like sentimental movies I suggest staying away, but otherwise you shouldn't be disappointed!P.S.

His sister and sister of his deceased wife play prominently in his life and as he goes from being a lonely widower to the adoption/foster parenting process for a young boy who has socialization problems.Cusack plays an author of SciFi thrillers and has a very short time to write his next big novel.  All this while he is learning and rearing a very troubled child who requires so very much attention.  Through it all, David (Cusack) learns to show consistency to his Dennis as Dennis continues to act out his Martian fantasy.  We learn that parenting is a matter of learning as you go many times.  For each child has his or her own individual ways of viewing the world from experience.  David learns to love when he is faced with being accepted or rejected for who he is 'right now.'  He is faced with a take it or leave it scenario that wakes him up to what life means to Dennis at that time.This is a great story to use to build up ones sense of compassion for others.

656911,A1IWWRZJOXOSYP,B00005JPT0,Lee Armstrong,"[7, 8]","""Martian Child"" was a film that I saw in the theatre and wanted to own.  The film's director, Menno Meyjes, was previously nominated for an Oscar for Best Adapted Screenplay for ""The Color Purple"" in 1985 & worked with John Cusak in his first film as a director, ""Max"" in 2002.  He keeps the interest and pacing of the film throughout.Having lost my wife (a year & a half ago) and now being a single dad, the part of the film where Cusak's David grieves over his wife affected me.  Whether those were glycerin tears or real ones, that scene where Cusak looks at his wife's picture and starts to cry makes me reach for a tissue.  It mirrors my living room about three times a day.  Cusak is adept at these light comic roles, which may not win him a Oscar, but which he does expertly and makes me want to see his work.  He was nominated for a Golden Globe for ""High Fidelity"" in 2002.Bobby Coleman who worked with Cusak in 2005'sMust Love Dogs (Widescreen Edition)does a good job as the weird little kid.  Coleman underplays the character, but it worked for me on film and made my heart go out to him.  The unusual dance that he & Cusak perform is so utterly bizarre that it makes me smile.The supporting players are strong.  Joan Cusak plays (SURPRISE!) her real-life brother John Cusak's sister!  She was twice nominated for Oscars for ""Working Girl"" in 1988 & ""In & Out"" in 1997.  Amanda Peet who was inThe Ex (Unrated Widescreen Edition)plays Harlee who may become David's steady girl.  The kiss they share would certainly make one believe so.  Sophie Okonedo who was nominated for a Best Supporting Actress for ""Hotel Rwanda"" and did such a great job as the lady of the evening inDirty Pretty Thingsplays the child care worker who encourages David to connect with Dennis.  Oliver Platt plays the agent Jeff who worked with Cusak inThe Ice Harvest (Widescreen Edition).  Richard Schiff from TV's ""West Wing"" and the great 2001 filmI am Sam (New Line Platinum Series)does an excellent job as the caring social worker.  Angelica Huston has a cameo as the book publisher Mimi and plays it well.  I found ""Martian Child"" to be a stunning film that affirms that love is the greatest thing in the universe.

He and his late wife had planned on adopting but never got around to.  The film contains the note that it is based on real incidents.  Don't fall into the trap of believing that this is a true story.  ""Based on"" simply means that whoever created the movie knew of someone, somewhere, who adopted a troubled kid.  Building a movie on a basic premise like that is common. Don't believe for a minute that ""base on"" means that this story is true.  John Cusack plays the prospective father and his real life sister Joan Cusack plays his less than fully supportive sister in the film.  It is a joy to see them playing siblings and makes the relationship that much more believable.  The storyline has been rehashed on this forum numerous times so I won't repeat it.

Early on you develop a curiosity about the child (Dennis), who claims he's from Mars, hence the title ""Martian Child"".  He is pretty peculiar, choosing to spend most of his time in a cardboard box at first for fear of the sun's damaging rays and possible social interaction, wearing a weight belt made of batteries so he won't float off into space, choosing to eat only Lucky Charms cereal, thinking he has special alien abilities, and ""collecting"" other people's possessions, but John Cusack's character (David) sees past all of this and sees into the heart of an child unsure about the stability of his world.  David welcomes Dennis into his home and feels that adopting him is appropriate.  They have a few troubles but David handles everything with the utmost patience and understanding at a very rare level, a level not usually present in the stressed out parents common in today's society.  In the end, Dennis trusts the trustworthy David and there is a positive resolution to the movie's final climax.

After watching the movie, though, I realized that we all have a bit of the ""Martian"" in us.  Dennis (Bobby Coleman) has been abandoned by his parents and spends his days hiding under a large box, seeing the world only through the handle slot.  Although most people do not go this far in expressing their feeling of not belonging, many of us have experienced at least some degree of rejection and disenfranchisement, and this makes it easy to understand why Dennis finds it difficult to come out of his box.  As science fiction writer David, played superbly by John Cusack, patiently draws him out, the two form a bond, and Dennis begins to make the transition between his isolated and lonely life to one that is more normal--although far from ordinary.  Dennis still has plenty of quirks, including the need to wear a weight belt to keep him from floating away due to the fact that Earth's force of gravity is lower than that of Mars.The journey from box to being David's son is one fraught with troubles and humor, and watching this movie is somehow rejuvenating.  Cusack's portrayal of David, with his deep affection for his new son and his humorous responses to Dennis's quirky statements and behavior is heartening.  His sensitivity to Dennis's feelings is touching, as well; when Dennis is expelled from school for stealing and being ""different from the others,"" David does not tell him he was expelled but that he (David) and the teacher agreed that a new school would be a good idea.Dennis continues to tell David that he is on a mission from Mars, and his acts of stealing are part of that mission; he is gathering information to take back to Mars with him.  David is annoyed when Dennis still believes he is a Martian after staying with him for some time, but he begins to notice strange evidence that there may be some truth to the story.  Dennis makes ""Martian wishes,"" for example, that always come to pass exactly as wished.  Could he truly be from Mars after all?  The truth does not come out until the end of the movie.This is a truly splendid movie that treats a painful subject in a fairly light and amusing manner yet still demonstrates respect and sensitivity toward Dennis.  Anyone who has ever felt that he didn't belong can identify with Dennis, and he is a character that you care about.  John Cusack's work in the movie is stellar, and I was literally shocked to discover that the movie was not a hit at the box office.  Even the music and the choreography of the ""nice talk"" scene with Dennis and David to the tune of ""Satellite"" are charming.  This movie is a refreshing change from the usual formula films that are as predictable as clockwork.  It's offbeat but thoroughly engaging, and despite some inevitable challenges that Dennis and David must go through, it is a feel-good movie that leaves the viewer feeling that anything is possible.

I have two adopted daughters and while the circumstances of their adoptions are quite different than the one portrayed in the film, parental love is the same no matter how a child becomes yours.I am about the same age as John Cusack and I have ""grown up"" with him ever since I saw him in ""Sixteen Candles.""  When I was young, I loved to see Mr. Cusack in his various 80's guises.  While I have enjoyed many of his film roles, ""The Sure Thing"" and ""Martian Child"" stand out as two of my most favorite.  I felt a connection with Walter ""Gib"" Gibson when I was an eighteen year old college freshman; and now, as a father, I feel the same about David Gordon.  As a father in my early 40's, it was very touching to enjoy ""Martian Child"" with my six year old daughter.  Although she has only seen the film about three or four times, he memories of it are very vivid and she often talks recalls the smallest details.  As such, she is now a big ""Lucky Charms"" fan and loves to listen to Guster's ""Satellite"" and get me to dance with her.""Martian Child,"" while sometimes a bit syrupy, is a lovely portrayal of a father's love for his child and how they spend meaningful time together.

As a child he was the oddball kid who just didn't fit in, and found comfort in stories...in make-believe.  Before his wife died they had been planning to adopt a child. 2-years later the adoption place called him back about possibly adopting this other oddball child who had been abandoned and emotionally abused.This fragile, intelligent, loveable little boy with this tiny voice is so messed up he has convinced himself he's from Mars and is only here to observe and report back.  Instead of playing with the other kids, he spends his time hiding in a box (with a view slot) because he's afraid of the sun's rays - which are not good for Martians.David opens his heart to this kid and in spite of his sister's cautions against being a single parent, much less one of a disturbed child - David accepts the challenge and goes ahead with the idea.  He has tons of love to give and lots of patience and understands that fantasy is a wonderful coping device for a child.  The relationship is a unique struggle, but David's love, natural instincts, patience and persistence and whatnot is the best chance this quirky screwed up kid has (maybe the only chance this kid has) and this is just a really rewarding story for the heart and mind.John Cusack puts in an amazing performance, the supporting cast (Joan Cusack, Amanda Peet, etc.) is fabulous, and the soundtrack is perfect.This is a special movie.

And where there is John Cusack, there is Joan Cusack, who is also a favorite of mine.  The brother/sister team always work well together.  The saying goes actors should never work with children and animals -- however, this movie really worked well with everyone involved being awesome.Cusack plays a sci-fic writer who is dealing with the passing of his wife and having writer's block.  He feels he needs something/someone in his life and applies to become an adoptive parent.Enter Bobby Coleman, a cute, sweet, talented little actor.  He is Dennis.  Dennis is odd, a misfit, one of those kids that everyone picks on and makes fun of.  However, all of this doesn't seem to bother Dennis and he truly believes he is from Mars.  He has his own little language, is super intelligent, walks to the beat of a different drummer.Cusack takes him into his heart and home and tries to help Dennis overcome all of his problems.  Dennis steals, lies, and doesn't have any friends.  Add all of these factors to him believing he is from Mars and you have a child who is crying out for attention, affection, stability, and love.This is a great family movie.  The Cusacks are always good in everything they do.  Bobby Coleman who plays Dennis had this role down pat.  He had great facial expressions, his voice was always in a different tone zone, and he was marvelous.  Hope to see more of this young man in the future.Great family movie, for people of all ages.

But, Sophie said she had someone special for him to see--so he went.What he saw was a kid-size Amazon box with his adoption candidate inside. Dennis (Bobby Coleman) was telling everyone he came from Mars.  Sophie thought David would be particularly adept at dealing with a kid like him since he was a science fiction author himself.Something touches a chord with David.  He was a different kid himself--he wouldn't want to bring a kid into the world, but there's one who really needs him--and maybe he needs the kid, too.Despite advice from his sister to reconsider, David accepts the challenge and chooses to take Dennis into his home and heart. Parenthood was an adventure that David was completely unprepared for.""Martian Child"" depicts who David and Dennis come to accept each other.  They face loss of a pet they've both come to love, a burgeoning love interest with Marlee (Amanda Peet) and dealing with the California bureaucracy governing adoptions.  Both Cusack and Coleman do an excellent job playing their respective parts.  You can tell there's real chemistry between the pair.

Felton,"[6, 22]","When the Internet first became widely used by the public (I'm sure most people know it was initially used by the military and educational institutions), you could trust what you read, but these days who knows? At another web site I read review after review praising this awful movie, but then I skipped to the first reviews, which were at the end since they were listed in reverse order chronologically, and I saw many very negative reviews. I'd guess that someone didn't want the bad reviews to be on top.I saw this movie over a week ago, and it left me such a bad impression that even now I still wanted to write a review. I will say, I am glad I watched the DVD extra so that I found out that it was based on a true story, and I could see where the script writers had gone beyond dramatic license. To me there were maybe 5 or 10 minutes that were OK, the rest was neither believable nor entertaining at all, and I think that maybe 20-30 years ago, before ""political correctness"" became such a force that it's hard to know what's right from wrong anymore, less people would condone a movie like this.The movie is a series of cheap contrivances meant to play on the audience's emotions. I don't know if the young ""star"" is as poor an actor as he came across, or if he was told to act that way, but his ""innocence,"" his desperate, high-pitched, wining tone, and many other manipulative demeanors meant to evoke sympathy, while in fact he had traits that were far from even decent, completely turned me off. I read a review which stated that he had a ""small stealing problem,"" which only could be written in an age of political correctness. The boy was a thief, maybe even a kleptomaniac, a serious problem that was never resolved. And the way he would cower or speak some phony Martian lingo when criticized in the slightest way was really nonsense to me, topped off by Cusak's own cowering, apologetic retreat, after doing nothing more than telling the boy in a way that was not mean-spirited at all that he had done things that were wrong.As I read the glowing reviews for this manipulative garbage, I thought to myself: is this what people do with their ""compassion"" in a world so full of cruelties and abominable treatments of others, to condone the behaviors of an abused boy so that anything he does is to be accepted and/or pitied, and no criticism is allowed?

656943,A3FEQXNCFC68KC,B00005JPT0,"SRFireside ""ZOOM!""","[0, 0]","If you want the crux of the movie it's very similar to K'Pax. Of course there are significant differences between the two films, but in essence both films are about the baseline character trying to figure out another character with odd tendencies to claims to be from another planet. K'Pax has an adult mental patient being the alien with his psychiatrist trying to figure him out. With Martian Child it's an orphan with special needs who believe's he's from Mars and a widowed science fiction novelist who wants to adopt him. With this difference the movie moves into different territory, but in the end both dramas move to bring revelations on the special situations that bring their perspective keepers into self realization.Just to sum up the plot a little more John Cusack plays the sci-fi writer who lost his wife not long ago when they were looking to adopt a child. Now his life is in a rut and the adoption agency matches him with a peculiar boy with various strange traits like keeping out of the sun, weighing himself down with a heavy (to keep from floating away), and of course claiming to be on a mission from Mars. Cusack's character falls in love with the boy and does everything he can to reach out and create a family. It's an endearing story, and it will hit a chord with those of you who have experienced situations with special needs children.Much like K'Pax the movie never really answers the question on whether the boy is from Mars or not. You get hints that will make people conclude one or the other, but doesn't establish the answer. It doesn't do this as well as K'Pax as there is a strong tendency to go to one end, and the mystery behind the question becomes less complicated. Instead Martian Child focuses on the interaction between potential father and son, and this is where the movie excels. The development and chemistry between the two is well rounded and filled with all those little breakthroughs, setbacks, and questions parents of special needs kids go through. It's not a super accurate window into this world, but it is a good impression.I think because the film loses focus on the big Martian question this is also where the film is lacking. The title of the movie tells it all, but the movie sidetracks from that title a bit too much. That's not to say the character development and script are wrong in any stretch of the imagination. Just that it could have more balanced. This movie is based on a novelette of the same name, and for those who read the book will notice a glaring omission regarding the father. This too can be considered an issue for them. As for me I learned a while back to not judge a movie by what it's based on. The movie has to stand on its own.The DVD has a good transfer with no artifacts and a nice crisp 1.85:1 anamorphic widescreen transfer. Audio is in Dolby 5.1 surround, but it's not the kind of film that wows you aurally. Dialog is clean though and the overall mix is well balanced. The extras are pretty impressive for a title that didn't get a lot of traction in the theaters. Here is the breakdown:Commentary - Producers Cory Sienega and David Kirshner and writers Seth Bass and Jonathan Tolin make a very interesting comment track. You can tell they loved the project and cover all sorts of things from big picture type themes to little production details, including an issue where they had to get another director mid-shooting.Handle with Care: Working with the Martian Child (24:18) - Covers production notes through interviews of cast and crew. More introspective than informational, but it's fun to watch how the staff sees the film.The Real Martian Child (13:20) - The one features interviews with the writer of the novel, David Gerrold. His book was semi-autobiographical and tells about his own adoption of a special needs child. You even get interviews with the child in question, all grown up. Producer interviews and a few home movies round up this featurette.Deleted Scenes (27:15) - A pretty large amount of alternate and deleted scenes broken down into 14 segments. Much of the footage is not worth adding to the film, but you do see a little gem here in there like some quirky behavior from the kid or some interesting extended dialog.Trailers - The movie trailer.Sneak Peeks - These are trailers for the movies Run Fatboy Run, The Last Mimzy, Gracie, Hairspray, and August Rush. They are also the same trailers that come up before the film.Do you or know somebody with a child with autism, developmental delays, emotional disturbances, and even physical disabilities? This would be a good movie to see. It's a fanciful look into this world of &#34;hard to care for&#34; children, but it's enough of a look to endear you into the sorts of challenges they face as well as why they face them. If you are a sci-fi fan this isn't much of a science-fiction film, but the subject matter is still fascinating even if it all may just be in some kid's head. I recommend a hard copy rental at the very least as the special features do add value to the viewing experience.",4,K'Pax light,1399507200,"05 8, 2014",2014,5057,"['want', 'crux', 'movie', 'very',

656944,A10C5CJK1YKGV0,B00005JPT0,Steffan Piper,"[1, 5]","The movie starts off, as expected with a soft narration by Cusack about the reality of his mundane life and how he was changed by the true events that the reader/viewer is about to see, it's not quite clear which. But this narration and slow pan to Cusack in a director's chair is not an introduction to this film, but possibly an interview to another film in the fictitious realm of the movie. Okay, is this the best way to start a movie? I don't think so.So let me stop right there.The story, while `loosely based' on true accounts and at times heartfelt, does initially come across as muddled, confused and without a real direction. The tone is supposed to be that light feeling that you might've experienced when you watchedNotting HillorAbout a Boy, two very decent `movies' played deftly by Hugh Grant. Now, here again we seem to have to indomitable John Cusack following the stylist coat-tails of Grant, to deliver up this strange and camp tale about a widower and his adopted son. But somewhere, the filmmakers decided that an intermittent narration is better than a full narration. Note to Menno Meyjes: ""If you're going to include a narration in the movie, include it. Half-measures never bear much fruit, and what fruit there is, is usually rotten.""I was moved once or twice while watching this, a sense of awe is created in the film that keeps you close, but sadly, it never really delivers. The real drag is when you find out that the boy is not from Mars, but it's just a ruse he employs because of personal and social detachment and Cusack, ahem ... David, does his best to placate the boy and keep him under the radar of Child Protective Services and give him a normal life, despite what he's been through. Some of the acting is very forgettable and lacking the type of angst that you would've expected from both of these actors, Cusack and Bobby Coleman.The movie comes off as simple and blas&eacute; and the selling point or theme just doesn't sit, gel or come together appropriately. Isn't Bobby Coleman the fictitious name of Corey Feldman in that movie `Dream a Little Dream' when he takes over Jason Robards' body? No matter. I digress. Sorry for the segue way.Now, I've discussed bad and trite endings in other reviews that should always be avoided. Now it seems that I'll have to put `runs away to a planetarium' on the list of these no-no's because what could've been a decent film, is spoiled by the `climax' at the end where the boy does his best to sabotage his human existence with his new father David Gerrold and brings the heat of the law down on him. Joan Cusack does her best job interview for future Disney movies by standing next to Amanda Peet, feigning concern for the camera about a boy who might plunge from a height.Maybe I was expecting something a little along the lines ofK-Pax. But, maybe if it went that direction everyone would've complained that it was too much like K-Pax. Perhaps a stronger marketing campaign for this movie and getting the message out there about it being a `true story' would've helped audience expectation. The cover of this DVD is a good example of the poor strategy that went into this project overall. It looks like an eighties Wham! poster that a tween-age girl might hang on her wall, not the poster for a dramatic film about adoption, detachment, emotional growth and bonding. Good lord, people. Could you have hashed this thing up any worse?And regarding the issue about David Gerrold being a gay, single father in real-life and this issue being ignored on-screen, just comes across as incredibly lame. At least Robin Williams had the guts to portray Armistead Maupin inThe Night Listenerand let the audience know what the real truth was with his character. Glassing over this minor point smacks of 'political correctness'.

Sure, we've all seen this story before:  Man meets boy-from-Mars; Man falls in love with boy-from-Mars; Man loses boy-from-Mars, etc.  Unfortunately this movie offers no new elements to this worn format, and it's all been done better before.  Beware of the filler characters, concocted to take up time that the thin main story line can't fill:  The best friend/agent played by Oliver Platt (rhymes with FLAT). The ""almost girlfriend"" played by Amanda Peet, whom you actually can see wondering, ""What am I doing in this movie?"" The ""heavy"" who turns happy social worker guy.  And don't forget Joan Cusak, John's sister, playing his, er, sister.  A rhetorical question:  Has Joan Cusak ever been in a movie that didn't star her brother, other than that Melanie Griffith empowerment pic?  If it wasn't enough that the director and writers were too lazy to provide a single original element to this movie, they had to tie up the film with a totally unbelievable recycled faux ""scene of peril"" to get the man and the boy-who-thinks-he's-from-Mars back together.  When all was said and done, this movie made me feel so bad I had to take two aspirin, go to bed, and call my doctor in the morning.  He told me to take it easy for a few days and to get my strength back by watching Cusak in two small classic films that (unlike ""Martin Child"") are well directed and well written:  ""The Sure Thing"" and ""Say Anything.""

The relationships between the man and the boy - the man's sister and the boy....well they felt REAL. It was sad and it was happy and just felt REAL even though the kid is a Martian. The ending was a bit unsatisfying because it made it seem like he was just a troubled kid. Hey!

Since this is basically a feel-good story, the two misfits end up as a perfect fit for each other.It's a ""relationships"" movie, so there's no real action to talk about, except for the day to day dealings between adoptive daddy and a very troubled boy. David has a female friend - not girlfriend, except maybe - who helps, and a sister who largely doesn't. He also has social workers to deal with, who are even more clueless than David about dealing with this unique child. The difference is that David knows that he doesn't know how to turn this little martian into a human child. The pros seem all too smug in their certainty, and all too aware of their power over the fragile bond between David and Dennis.This narrowly avoids saccharine overload, mainly through its sympathetic regard for a kid who's really out there. Some of us have spent our lives not just marching to a different drummer, but marching down a different street completely - we see a lot of ourselves in that strange little boy.
