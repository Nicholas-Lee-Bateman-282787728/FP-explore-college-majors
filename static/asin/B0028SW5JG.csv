My two favorite are when the couple sue a limosine service after they caused them to miss their prom and the girl who sues the popular kid at school for the cost of her dress after he stood her up for the homecoming dance. A lot of the others are good too. the only problem is that some of them are a little to serious. However you should still get it because its good.,5,Human Lie-Detector,1341187200,"07 2, 2012",2012,465,"['used', 'watch', 'show', 'tv', 'was', 'good', 'Actually', 'still', 'Theese', 'cases', 'are', 'anyway', 'two', 'favorite', 'are', 'when', 'couple', 'sue', 'limosine', 'service', 'caused', 'miss', 'prom', 'girl', 'who', 'popular', 'kid', 'school', 'cost', 'dress', 'stood', 'up', 'homecoming', 'dance', 'lot', 'others', 'are', 'good', 'too', 'only', 'problem', 'are', 'little', 'serious', 'However', 'should', 'still', 'get', 'good']",Judge Judy - 2 Pack

1256213,A2X4H1XE0GQ8QJ,B0028SW5JG,Plain Jane,"[6, 6]","I purchased this as a gift for my mother, Judge Judy's #1 fan.  The picture indicates this is a nice boxed set of two DVDs, when in reality, I received two DVD cases held together with shrink wrap.  Misleading and crappy.  The quality of the printing on the DVDs was pretty simplistic and looks like it could have been produced in someone's basement; just simple black and white lettering.  There was no effort to clear up any of the film quality.  There's no high def stuff here.  No closed captioning either, which makes no sense since CBS already did this when the show aired.It was very clear you weren't getting a lot of episodes from the start, with only 100 and 105 minutes per DVD, but there are a fair number of bonus features: Interviews, promos, and things of that nature.  Most of these cases look like they're at least a decade old, so long time fans probably won't remember them.  They also don't feature credits at the end of each episode, which is great for people like my mom who don't want to watch them (and irritating for people like myself who like that kind of trivia/info).  If you just want some episodes of Judge Judy, these are the only couple of DVDs available, and my mom loved and watched these immediately.  However, I was disappointed with the quality of the packaging and the DVDs themselves.If CBS would release either an entire season of Judge Judy or just more DVDs in general, I'd absolutely buy them for my mother.  I realize putting a show on DVD with different people on every episode would be a challenge, but I think they'd be pleasantly surprised with the sales.  Hope they'll consider this in the future.",3,"Misleading, Mediocre Quality, But It's All We Have",1356480000,"12 26, 2012",2012,1647,"['purchased', 'gift', 'mother', 'Judge', 'Judy', '1', 'fan', 'picture', 'nice', 'boxed', 'set', 'two', 'DVDs', 'when', 'reality', 'received', 'two', 'DVD', 'cases', 'held', 'together', 'shrink', 'wrap', 'Misleading', 'crappy', 'quality', 'printing', 'DVDs', 'was', 'pretty', 'simplistic', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'produced', 'someone', 'basement', 'just', 'simple', 'black', 'white', 'lettering', 'was', 'effort', 'clear', 'up', 'film', 'quality', 'high', 'def', 'stuff', 'here', 'closed', 'captioning', 'sense', 'CBS', 'already', 'did', 'when', 'show', 'aired.It', 'was', 'very', 'clear', 'were', ""n't"", 'getting', 'lot', 'episodes', 'start', 'only', '100', '105', 'minutes', 'DVD', 'are', 'fair', 'number', 'bonus', 'features', 'Interviews', 'promos', 'things', 'nature', 'Most', 'cases', 'look', ""'re"", 'least', 'decade', 'old', 'so', 'long', 'time', 'fans', 'probably', 'wo', ""n't"", 'remember', 'also', 'do', ""n't"", 'feature', 'credits', 'end', 'episode', 'great', 'people', 'mom', 'who', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'watch', 'irritating', 'people', 'who', 'kind', 'trivia/info', 'just', 'want', 'episodes', 'Judge', 'Judy', 'are', 'only', 'couple', 'DVDs', 'available', 'mom', 'loved', 'watched', 'immediately', 'However', 'was', 'disappointed', 'quality', 'packaging', 'DVDs', 'themselves.If', 'CBS', 'would', 'release', 'entire', 'season', 'Judge', 'Judy', 'just', 'more', 'DVDs', 'general', ""'d"", 'absolutely', 'buy', 'mother', 'realize', 'putting', 'show', 'DVD', 'different', 'people', 'episode', 'would', 'be', 'challenge', 'think', ""'d"", 'be', 'pleasantly', 'surprised', 'sales', 'Hope', ""'ll"", 'consider', 'future']",Judge Judy - 2 Pack

Powers ""show maniac""","[16, 20]","The tongue belongs to Judge Judy, the pint-sized Queen Bee of the Judge shows where she cheerfully presides hurling barbed insults at the litigants before her.  Where else can you watch a jurist perched behind her bench, wearing a black robe with a white-laced collar and red wig(she's grey off camera)litigating small claim cases, where her kindest words for both plaintiff and defendant are ""moron"" and the ever popular ""idiot"". She's my kind of gal, I know a lot of morons and idiots but I hold my tongue and just admire the way she tosses around such adjectives with unbridled glee.Sometimes you start to feel bad for the poor creatures who appear before her, but any cash judgements she awards are paid by the production company, so that softens the abuse somewhat.Judge Judy has hinted she may soon hang up her robe and that would be a shame, because the older she gets the meaner and crankier she will get and just imagine the tongue lashings she will administer then.If I had a small claim case I would happily appear before Judge Judy and bare the shredding, as long as at the end of the day I am pocketing a check for 5 grand.
