1602603,A3JW06DZ1S5E2H,B009VL29I0,Daniel B.,"[1, 1]","Chow Yun Fat has always been a charismatic, gifted and versatile actor. I would go so far as to say he is one of Icons of World Cinema, along with Toshiro Mifune, Marcello Mastroianni, Max von Sydow. I'm not suggesting the four of them are equals in sheer acting prowess, but rather they all have been integral players in benchmark films. Consider SEVEN SAMURAI, LA DOLCE VITA, THE SEVENTH SEAL, CROUCHING TIGER/HIDDEN DRAGON. Chow Yun Fat achieved his earliest fame in ultra-violent action films in which he played the bad guy or the good bad guy or the good guy - there's a progression of characterizations which past actors like Humphrey Bogart followed as well. I never appreciated those early films, often directed by John Woo. The many killings were executed by a stone-faced Chow Yun Fat, with no trace of any moral compunction, but by the end there was frequently some sentimentalized plot twist to justify the killings, for example, his neice was held hostage while he did the gangsters' dirty work. The purpose of such movies with their exaggerated violence was to cater to our joy in mayhem, out-of-control violence, the thrill of killing. Why not be honest and admit it? When Sam Peckinpah made THE WILD BUNCH and STRAWDOGS he frankly created bloodbaths for our entertainment, and he did not sentimentalize it, as the Asian films did. So it is a pleasant surprise to witness Chow Yun Fat's transformation of himself as an actor. He no longer makes the John Woo-type bloody thrillers. Rather he plays in historical dramas, embodying legendary leaders with considerable gravitas and nuance in his performances. Often there is a sly, understated humor as he outsmarts his opponents in treachery. Other times, as in this film, THE ASSASSINS, he is tormented by guilt and fear. And he is totally convincing as an ancient Chinese figure, as he proved in a biopic in which he plays Confucius very credibly. One aspect of these historical dramas which makes for challenging viewing is the convoluted plots. I gave up an hour into this film trying to comprehend the plot and just enjoyed each scene for the excellence of the acting and staging. But by the end, the plot had been clarified to my satisfaction. I should mention this is an ensemble effort, and the other actors are equally convincing and memorable. There is a very young (aren't they all?) and lovely (of course) actress who plays Chow Yun Fat's ambiguous love interest. I found her to be charming and ingratiating, much like Ziyi Zhang, who has, like Chow Yun Fat, grown beyond such limited roles and transformed herself as an actress. In the closing moments of this film, the character Chow Yun Fat plays confronts the moral cost of the life he has lived and it is a devastating scene. This is the key moral element that was missing from his early film career, and his acting now makes you feel the moral issues with power and truth.",5,THE ASSASSINS - Imperial History or How did any ancient Chinese leader survive Court Intrique?,1391558400,"02 5, 2014",2014,2902,"['Chow', 'Yun', 'Fat', 'always', 'been', 'charismatic', 'gifted', 'versatile', 'actor', 'would', 'go', 'so', 'far', 'say', 'one', 'Icons', 'World', 'Cinema', 'Toshiro', 'Mifune', 'Marcello', 'Mastroianni', 'Max', 'von', 'Sydow', ""'m"", 'not', 'suggesting', 'four', 'are', 'equals', 'sheer', 'acting', 'prowess', 'rather', 'have', 'been', 'integral', 'players', 'benchmark', 'films', 'Consider', 'SEVEN', 'SAMURAI', 'LA', 'DOLCE', 'VITA', 'THE', 'SEVENTH', 'SEAL', 'CROUCHING', 'TIGER/HIDDEN', 'DRAGON', 'Chow', 'Yun', 'Fat', 'achieved', 'earliest', 'fame', 'ultra-violent', 'action', 'films', 'played', 'bad', 'guy', 'good', 'bad', 'guy', 'good', 'guy', 'progression', 'characterizations', 'past', 'actors', 'Humphrey', 'Bogart', 'followed', 'as', 'well', 'never', 'appreciated', 'early', 'films', 'often', 'directed', 'John', 'Woo', 'many', 'killings', 'were', 'executed', 'stone-faced', 'Chow', 'Yun', 'Fat', 'trace', 'moral', 'compunction', 'end', 'was', 'frequently', 'sentimentalized', 'plot', 'twist', 'justify', 'killings', 'example', 'neice', 'was', 'held', 'hostage', 'did', 'gangsters', 'dirty', 'work', 'purpose', 'such', 'movies', 'exaggerated', 'violence', 'was', 'cater', 'joy', 'mayhem', 'out-of-control', 'violence', 'thrill', 'killing', 'Why', 'not', 'be', 'honest', 'admit', 'When', 'Sam', 'Peckinpah', 'made', 'THE', 'WILD', 'BUNCH', 'STRAWDOGS', 'frankly', 'created', 'bloodbaths', 'entertainment', 'did', 'not', 'sentimentalize', 'Asian', 'films', 'did', 'So', 'pleasant', 'surprise', 'witness', 'Chow', 'Yun', 'Fat', 'transformation', 'actor', 'no', 'longer', 'John', 'Woo-type', 'bloody', 'thrillers', 'historical', 'dramas', 'embodying', 'legendary', 'leaders', 'considerable', 'gravitas', 'nuance', 'performances', 'sly', 'understated', 'humor', 'opponents', 'treachery', 'Other', 'times', 'film', 'THE', 'ASSASSINS', 'tormented', 'guilt', 'fear', 'totally', 'convincing', 'ancient', 'Chinese', 'figure', 'proved', 'biopic', 'Confucius', 'very', 'credibly', 'One', 'aspect', 'historical', 'dramas', 'challenging', 'viewing', 'convoluted', 'plots', 'gave', 'up', 'hour', 'film', 'trying', 'comprehend', 'plot', 'just', 'enjoyed', 'scene', 'excellence', 'acting', 'staging', 'end', 'plot', 'had', 'been', 'clarified', 'satisfaction', 'should', 'mention', 'ensemble', 'effort', 'other', 'actors', 'are', 'equally', 'convincing', 'memorable', 'very', 'young', 'are', ""n't"", 'lovely', 'course', 'actress', 'who', 'Chow', 'Yun', 'Fat', 'ambiguous', 'love', 'interest', 'found', 'be', 'charming', 'ingratiating', 'much', 'Ziyi', 'Zhang', 'who', 'Chow', 'Yun', 'Fat', 'grown', 'such', 'limited', 'roles', 'transformed', 'actress', 'closing', 'moments', 'film', 'character', 'Chow', 'Yun', 'Fat', 'moral', 'cost', 'life', 'lived', 'devastating', 'scene', 'key', 'moral', 'element', 'was', 'missing', 'early', 'film', 'career', 'acting', 'now', 'feel', 'moral', 'issues', 'power', 'truth']",N/A

1602607,A2FRKEXDXDN1KI,B009VL29I0,Dennis A. Amith (kndy),"[7, 8]","When it comes to Chinese historical dramas, the warlord and chancellor Cao Cao has been featured in various films and video games.A man who has been portrayed as cruel in order to achieve dominance in China and thus looked at as a tyrant, he is also praised as a military genius.  But while historians will forever debate Cao Cao and many loose film adaptations continue to be created on historical figures, in today's modern age, you tend to watch these films and not take it so much as factual history but as entertainment.And who best to write the film than Bin Wang (""House of Flying Daggers"", ""Hero"") and feature the work of director Linshan Zhao.  And for marketability, cast as Cao Cao is actor Chow Yun-Fat (""Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"", ""The Killer"", ""Hard Boiled"", ""Curse of the Golden Flower""), to promote the film overseas, Japanese actor Hiroshi Tamaki (""Nodame Cantabile"", ""Last Christmas"", ""Waterboys"") was also cast as the character Mu Shun and cast for the female lead of Ling Ju is up-and-coming actress Crystal Liu Yi Fei (""White Vengeance"", ""The Forbidden Kingdom"").VIDEO:""The Assassins"" is presented in 1080p High Definition (2:35:1 aspect ratio) with beautiful cinematography by Xiaoding Zhao (""House of the Flying Daggers"", ""Curse of the Golden Flower"", ""The Flowers of War"").  With that being said, it looks like there was quite a bit of experimentation on colors.  For one, the film looks great when it showcases more blues or even the red dress of Lingju.  Picture quality also has some softness and the occasional white specks (which was actually surprising considering this film was released in theaters less than four months ago.  But while the film is not the most detailed in HD, it does look good most of the time.AUDIO & SUBTITLES:""The Assassins"" is presented in Mandarin and English DTS-HD Master Audio 5.1.  And from the beginning of the film, the surround channels, including the rear surround channels are much active and become quite immersive as we hear everything from the scurrying ants to the soldiers on horseback.  So, you do have your immersive moments during the action sequences.  Dialogue is crystal clear and for the most part, I was impressed with the lossless audio for this film.  I didn't listen to the English dub but for those who enjoy their foreign films with English voice acting, it is offered as a selection.Subtitles are in English.SPECIAL FEATURES:""The Assassins"" come with the following special features:Behind the Scenes - (13:45) Featuring interviews with the talents, including behind-the-scenes and outtakes.Trailer - (1:40) Theatrical trailer for ""The Assassins"".JUDGMENT CALL:When it comes to historical dramas, especially on important, historical Chinese individuals, I have watched many films to see how they become more dramatic, more action-driven and possibly so out of left-field that it becomes more of an entertaining popcorn action film.From film, TV dramas to video games, they are usually not 100% factual, but inspired on actual events or characters.And when it comes to Cao Cao, from ""Romance of the Three Kingdoms"" to other depictions of his likeliness, it's usually not good.  Sure, he was a military genius that was able to dominate North China but by doing so, a lot of innocent people and other warlords were killed.  And he was also an accomplished poet as well.And while it is not really know what is fiction and non-fiction about the warlord, what we do know is that these depictions tend to skew towards Cao Cao as more of a powerful antagonist.With the 2012 film ""The Assassins"", Cao Cao is given a different treatment.  Writer Bin Wang has written major films such as ""Hero"" and ""House of Flying Daggers"" and for ""The Assassins"" instead of showing him as a tyrant, he wanted to show a more human-side of a powerful man that is changed by... love.Suffice to say, this may not go over well with certain viewers but for those who are entertained by the fact that Chow Yun-Fat is portraying Cao Cao, you can't help but want to see what writer Bin Wang and director Linshan Zhao has in store.The good news is that Chow Yun-Fat does a wonderful job of playing Cao Cao.  From being a man of power, a man who knows that people fear him but also a fragile man behind-the-scenes who has nightmares and headaches because so many want him dead, including people who may be close to him.  He lives on guard most of the time and he is very observant of everyone around him.But yet, he allows one woman to get close to him.  Lingju, not a historical character in the historical novel ""Romance of the Three Kingdoms"" but she is an assassin who was trained since she was young for one thing, kill Cao Cao and she will have her freedom.Featuring another fantastic performance from young, up-and-coming actress Crystal Liu Yi Fei, Lingju is a woman that is conflicted.  Having been exposed to freedom, she knows her mission but yet talking to people around her, she tries to understand why Cao Cao kills, why is he the way he is and why do people employed by him, like working for him.  She starts to see the positives of what he brings to his own soldiers and mistresses, but most of all, he is kind to her.But the question is why is he kind to her and why has he opened her up to his world?  That is a major part of the story that you'll have to watch and find out.I have to admit that I was shocked to see well-known Japanese actor Hiroshi Tamaki cast as Mu Shun (which is a character featured in ""Romance of the Three Kingdoms"") but many of these bigger budget films are now more conscience of overseas marketing and doing what they can to make money overseas.  With the character o Mu Shun, unlike the historical novel where Mu Shun delivers letters back and forth to Empress Fu Shou and her father Fu Wan, the role of Mu Shun is much different in ""The Assassins"".In this film, Mu Shun grew up with Lijung as kids, both were best friends and eventually fall in love with each other.  But because the two were sent on a secret mission to kill Cao Cao, while Lijung wants to escape with Mu Shun and be happy, unbeknown to Lijung is that he was castrated (ensuring that he doesn't do anything to wreck the plan to kill Cao Cao and preventing him to be sexual with any woman).Knowing that he can't give her happiness as a man, he just wants to see Lijung happy and trying to turn down her advances, while she is not so sure why he has become so distant.Suffice to say, ""The Assassins"" is a film that becomes more of a romantic drama.  A love triangle than a historical epic.  To help keep the film so entertaining and audiences not being disappointed that Cao Cao is changing because of love, writer Bin Wang and director Linshan Zhao are able to integrate enough action scenes to make the film quite entertaining instead of it being sweet and sappy.Chow Yun-Fat carries this film on his shoulders, as he did with another historical drama film ""Confucius"", but in dramatic fashion, I suppose the film works on that level.  It's just that anyone expecting more war, more strategy, more battles featuring this military genius may be disappointed by the focus of the romantic elements, especially of how one mistress is able to change Cao Cao.As for the Blu-ray release, the cinematography by Xiaoding Zhao is beautiful but interesting color choices used for the film.  Picture quality has its issue with softness and some scenes with white specks but other than that, the film does look very good on Blu-ray.  But the highlight is the film's immersive soundtrack.  Great use of the surround channels, nothing that utilizes LFE but more of use of ambiance and overall sounds, especially during the opening moments of the film.  As for special features, there is a ""behind-the-scenes"" feature and a trailer.Overall, ""The Assassins"" is an enjoyable historical drama inspired by North China warlord Cao Cao and loosely based on individuals featured in the historical novel ""Romance of the Three Kingdoms"".  This film is not historical fact, nor should the story be seen as fact.  If anything, ""The Assassins"" should be seen as a film about one man known for dominating in war and reigning in power, starting to eventually learn more about life and the importance of life thanks to his new mistress, unaware that this woman is an assassin.Chow Yun-Fat brings a more human side to Cao Cao who is typically seen as a tyrannic warlord and also a wonderful performance from Crystal Liu Yi Fei.  But a love triangle? Surprisingly, for this film, it works.",4,"(3.5 Stars) ""The Assassins"" is an enjoyable historical drama inspired by North China warlord Cao Cao",1364601600,"03 30, 2013",2013,8522,"['When',

Wilson ""SonRisedInTheEast""","[1, 2]","It takes a certain talent to make a movie starring the great Chow Yun Fat as famous three kingdoms period warlord Cao Cao... nearly unwatchable.  I mean seriously? How?!  Well, first time director Linshan Zhao managed to do just that and more.  The Assassins tells the story of two young, well... assassins(duh) raised together since childhood for the day they could get close enough to Cao Cao to end his life.  The two grow feelings for each other through their mutual hardships and are put in a difficult situation when they realize that Cao Cao may not be the complete villain he's been made out to be.  To be quite honest, when you truly consider that plot it's not that surprising the film flops.  Who signs up for a Three Kingdoms era film with little to no action and featuring a 50/50 plot split about the love of two young assassins? With only a fleeting mention of both Guan Yu and Liu Bei?  Not this guy! Even Chow Yun Fat can't make any headway as Cao Cao himself.  Cao Cao is a stoic leader of men who shows little, if any emotion-- does that sound like the role for Chow Yun Fat?!  The plot is slow and meandering, the music is as dull as the characters, the action infrequent(and poorly choreographed when it does happen)... the set pieces are pretty though.  The Assassins is a period drama and NOT an action film, which is fine, but it's one of the worst I've seen in quite some time.  Do yourself a favor and watch John Woo's Red Cliff saga instead.

You have to watch Night Watch and then Day Watch..  Truly some of the most interesting and creative movie making I have seen in a while. : Timur Bekmambetov is a visionary master..... The vampires are refreshing change from the romance chick flick love stories that have come out of America over the decades. There are good and bad vampires, and the bad ones are just mischievous evil buggers. I found my self really on my toes wanting to find out if Anton makes it out alive. I loved the special effects and overall imagery. Timur and Channel One did such a great job on these two movies. I love how when things get crazy, they crank up the rock music and speed up the action in the scenes. At the end there is one final bet between good and evil and when you see the result you just want to say hell yeah Anton. Konstantin Khabensky is a great actor who brings you into his character, even with the English subtitles. then the coolnees of who they did the subtitles of the dark ones, with fading red like blood, the subtitles reacted to the scene like when Kyotos father was playing the drum and the words bounced with the beat or when they throw meat on the wall and the subtitles splatter on the wall. Such a great movie, and series. Night watch and Day Watch are two of a trilogy though the third is either still in production. If you like to see Russian culture and the sites and sounds of Moscow you will enjoy this movie for that fact as well. The scenes of Moscow destroyed from the various battled of the great dark & light ones is epic.

The newer movies from China are noticeably more beautiful so I was expecting no less from this movie. I was not disappointed in the least about the cinematography. It was extremely crisp and clear and the use of colors and scenery were wonderful. The costumes were also visually stunning. Unfortunately, that was the highlight of the film for me.This movie is about the story of Cao Cao, played by Chow Yun Fat. I've watched a couple of movies regarding the Three kingdoms of China so I sort of picked up some of the history between the movies and reading what I can about it. The last movie that I saw that showed Cao Cao in a negative light was Red Cliff (by the way, an excellent movie to watch if you like this time period ) so for some reason I had that mental picture of Cao Cao in my mind for this movie. This movie spun off a different view of Cao Cao which had me rooting for him. Interesting since I was predisposed to disliking him based on what I knew. Chow Yun Fat, was as always, amazing an that was probably what got me. He is such a gifted actor that I'm always blown away by how he interprets and portrays the characters that he is playing. He IS the character and I forget that he is just Chow Yun Fat in a costume. Very multi-dimensional picture of his character- which for me kept me interested in his acting more so the movie. There was also a great supporting cast. I've seen a lot of Crystal Liu Fei in her mainland television series and most of her movies so I wasn't particularly very surprised by her performance. The others I was unfamiliar with but I can't say that I was disappointed at all with the cast.I have to admit, the movie jumped around a little bit so if you don't pay attention, you'll miss some things. And there are some areas where you'll wonder what happened, because there isn't much explanation to what goes on.  I found myself with my eyes glazed over at some parts simply because this movie was super slow in areas.  I really think some parts could have been cut out and no one would have noticed. Movie was a couple of hours long so be prepared to be in one place for awhile. Also, if you're expecting a lot of action- you'll be disappointed. This movie is more about the story of Cao Cao and his reign of power and what he had to do to stay on top rather than swordplay and battles. There are some fighting scenes, but again, it's not some Donnie Yen movie where there is advanced choreography. This is more of a history lesson with a storyline. Speaking of which- the storyline outside of Cao Cao's life progression seemed to be input to create some drama conflict to make it more interesting, but  I really felt it didn't add a whole lot to the movie. Rather, I found myself tuning out that part of the story to focus more on Cao Cao's plot. It almost felt like it didn't belong. I give this movie three stars- okay, but not one I will watch again. Chow Yun Fat's performance is worth watching but only if you want to give up a couple of hours.

Now another Chinese film arrives, featuring Cao Cao, a real-life historical figure, who is often depicted as a cunning antagonist. But &#8220;The Assassins&#8221; attempts to portray Cao Cao in a different light.Set in 220, &#8220;The Assassins&#8221; stars Chow Yun-fat (who dropped out of &#8220;Red Cliff&#8221;) as Cao Cao in his old age. Disguised as mistress and palace eunuch, childhood friends Lingju (Liu Yifei) and Mu Shun (Hiroshi Tamaki) have managed to infiltrate Cao Cao&#8217;s Bronze Sparrow Platform to kill him, but they soon realize that their mission is more difficult than they expected especially in front of charismatic Cao Cao, or &#8220;Duke of Wei.&#8221; And they are not only ones that are attempting to assassinate him.Don&#8217;t expect action movie here. &#8220;The Assassins&#8221; is an interesting attempt to focus the complicated aspects of Cao Cao, as a ruler, father and even lover. Yohei Taneda&#8217;s (&#8220;Kill Bill Vol.&#8221;) gorgeous production design of the palace is beautiful to see, and acting is all effective, with Chow Yun-fat as enigmatic Cao Cao.But I think &#8220;The Assassins&#8221; tries to bite off more than it can chew.
