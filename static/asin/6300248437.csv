228486,AAVLB0GGEKRCO,6300248437,Andrew Raker,"[1, 1]","This 1985 BBC production of Silas Marner is pretty loyal to Mary Ann Evan's (i.e. George Eliot's) novel ""Silas Marner: The Weaver of Raveloe."" I had to read the novel ""Silas Marner"" in 10th grade English. While I do not remember all of the minor details of the novel, I do not recall this BBC production missing any of the major characters or elements of plot.I also have always enjoyed watching videos starring Ben Kingsley (ex: Oliver Twist, Gandhi, Schindler's List).  While Silas Marner seldom speaks for the first half of the film, Ben Kingsley does a good job portraying Silas Marner's essential character traits (as described in the novel).Now, unlike BBC's Daniel Deronda or Middlemarch, which have an aspect ratio of 16:9, Silas Marner (like The Mill on the Floss and Adam Bede) has an aspect ratio of 4:3. This in unfortunate, but it does not make the film too difficult to view.Also, unlike many of Charles Dickens' works, many of Mary Ann Evan's novels have NOT been made into films by other companies (ex: Hallmark or Masterpiece Theatre).

As a 14-year-old boy, there was nothing in the story to keep me interested in the writing. The little girl with curls in the tale didn't even seem much like Shirley Temple either. The novel remained dormant in my imagination until, much later in my life, Ben Kingsley performed the role of Silas Marner in the 1980s. His performance made Silas Marner come alive for me and Patsy Kensit, an absolutely gorgeous and lovely young girl here, gave the story the sweetness Eliot had always intended. I have read more George Eliot's novels since my high school days, but nothing quite replaces the transformation of my understanding in regard to George Eliot's storytelling quite like seeing this particular adaptation of Eliot's novel.It is gorgeous and moving from beginning to end.

A rival wants Silas's girlfriend, and will stop at nothing to get her. Everyone is a member of the village-church, everyone knows everyone, and thus the ability to do business in the village is dependant upon good standing in the community.This is a story of people who ignored all the good a man had done, focus only on an incident that is out-of-character for him, and are unwilling to make the effort to restore a man to relationship.When friends let you down, money may fill the gap.A second, scoundrel comes into the life of Silas.Yet, something good also comes into Silas's life that gives him joy.Some heartwarming moments.You are able to follow this good, story without having read the book.

Silas Marner is a gem of a movie, obviously based on a classic, and after seeing it, I understand why the book is required reading in many English classes. I myself have never read the book, and therefore appreciate becoming acquainted with it through this movie.The setting appears to be in the 1600-1700s England. Silas Marner is wrongly accused of murder and is exiled from his community. When he arrives in another village, he becomes the mysterious weaver of fine cloth, who lives alone and rarely speaks to anyone. The squire from whom he rents his cottage meanwhile, is providing for his opium-addicted wife that he has secretly married. He keeps her and their baby daughter hidden from the public in a tiny apartment in the village. Struggling to the squire's mansion one night to reveal her existence to his family, the woman dies in the snow, and Silas Marner finds the toddler in his cottage. Immediately he takes to her, and convinces people he should adopt her. The following part of the movie of his developing relationship with this adorable little acress is precious.Marner lives frugally, raising the child, but when she is 16, the squire steps in, and Marner and his daughter must make a decision that will test their relationship. There is a subplot concerning the squire's wayward brother whose actions affect all their lives, forcing all the characters to a turning point.Ben Kingsley's acting is excellent as he goes through the different periods of his life, and the movie does a fine job of portraying the era.
