741577,A1S3C5OFU508P3,B00008G629,Charles Ashbacher,"[2, 3]","The Roman Empire was truly an amazing political, economic and social entity. A wide variety of cultures and tribes were conquered and absorbed into the Empire. From the dark skinned North Africans to the blonde and fair-skinned people of Northern Europe to the swarthy inhabitants of Judea, they all brought their cultural heritage, religious beliefs and history into the Empire. Slavery was a fundamental part of the functioning of the Roman Empire, as the majority of people were slaves of one form or another. However, as is pointed out on this video, the slavery was not based on skin color, but on your history and social condition. If you were part of the aristocracy and were loyal to the Empire, then skin color was irrelevant. No political entity then or since has been able to command such loyalty from so diverse a population.As the Empire generally ceased to expand and began the process of consolidation, many problems appeared. In a relatively short time, the Empire had expanded from the leg and boot of Italy to encompass nearly all the Mediterranean coastline and most of Europe. This led to severe political and social problems that took decades to resolve. Once an Emperor ascended the throne, the twin problems of succession and how to remove a mad tyrant were the most serious issues. The Emperor's word was law, yet that word could be used to cause the deaths of political rivals. At the end, assassination was the only means where an insane Emperor could be removed from his position.This video is a superb recapitulation of that most dynamic of times. The imagery and narration answer many of the questions as to how the Empire was able to weather the first storms of political instability. Inherent in that stability was the first rumblings of a major new religion created from the life of a humble Jewish martyr.

741579,A2GCHG6U8HTVIT,B00008G629,C. O. DeRiemer,"[2, 3]","This PBS-produced documentary, which surveys Rome in the First Century, runs 219 minutes in four parts. It is so calm, so respectful, so stately and so dull that it made me wonder if they really were talking about Rome.The tales of the emperors, of course, range from greatness to pederasty, from the building of an intercontinental transportation system to wretched excess, from mutual murder to becoming gods. Rome also is the story of great poets, writers, historians, and builders. The documentary spends a lot of time reminding us of this with quotes read by actors with generically well-bred voices.Even more important and interesting is why the Romans were able to create such an empire. What was the force behind a crummy little village on the Tiber winding up owning everything from England to Egypt? And who was responsible for the most impressive set of officer's uniforms until the Nazis?Rome is the story not just of emperors and poets, but also of engineers and soldiers, of a great civil service and a slave economy, of an empire-wide free-trade zone and a universal set of laws. Rome might nail you to a cross, but in general if you didn't say bad things about the emperor-god you could believe in any other gods that took your fancy. Said Edward Gibbon, ""The various modes of worship, which prevailed in the Roman World, were all considered by the people, as equally true; by the philosopher, as equally false; and by the magistrate, as equally useful. And thus toleration produced not only mutual indulgence, but even religious concord.""Little of this practical cynicism and do-the-job-right energy comes through in this documentary.I have a great admiration for Sigourney Weaver as an actress, but her narration is simply too emotionless and too earnest. Does she have any more interest in first century Rome than most of us do? Probably not. She was hired to read the author's narration and she does with placid professionalism. The actors selected to voice the words of Ovid, Tacitus and the rest of the dead Romans bring even less moxie to the enterprise. Their voices are smooth, professional and uninteresting.This documentary is well intentioned, probably more so than is good for it.

741585,A3MFF3HWX2TB60,B00008G629,DR-J-J,"[3, 5]","Overall, an interesting, if somewhat slow and plodding, historical overview of the Roman Empire in their first 100 years. Unfortunately, the highly questionable historical overview of the rise of Christianity (by Karen King in the video)... she is professor at Harvard in a very prestigious chair, and yet I have serious misgivings by the tenor of her short overview of how Christianity (specifically Jesus) came to ""power."" According to King, Jesus rose to prominesne when he joined a band of outsiders and discontents that were against the Roman government. Then the Government arresting him for causing trouble and ""rightly"" put him to death for these charges since he was committed to stirring up the masses against Rome. She quotes passages about ""turning father against son, mother against daughter"" as support for this idea, even though this is clearly not ""rise up against the government talk.""Actually, Jesus prevented his disciples from rising up against the Roman ruling authority. It was the Sadducees and Pharisees ruling elite that wanted Jesus removed for his teaching about Kingdom ethics and the Good news. The Romans (Pontius Pilate) found nothing to support sedition charges. So, to make a claim (so quickly, with such weak support) to the contrary to leave the impression that practically no New Testament scholar would support, that seems less than ideal. It seems weak and it is disappointing. Obviously, she doesn't think much of Christianity. Fine. But this was not her best avenue to say that. (In see in a Google Search, that the Harvard Review (from her own school) has pulled a plan series of articles from her for publication. That is nearly unheard of, so perhaps she is being called on weak scholarship unbefitting an institution such as Harvard. Regardless, King's brief work on this video was a poor effort on her part. And quite frankly, I blame the producers and directors, two ladies: Lyn Goldfarb and Margaret Koval. They shouldn't have allowed this type of hit and run attack in a supposedly historically accurate production. Now, I would support them if they said something like, Some recent scholars have advanced the idea that it was Jesus himself who lead a band of seditious rebels that were then rightly judged and convicted to death. Here is one such scholar, Karen King. As long as they also indicated that most scholars would take the very opposite position. See, the problem there is that it isn't the place in this type of documentary to do that level of debate, so I just have to think that the producers, Lyn and Margaret, were woefully out of line here.In addition, Karen claims that early disciples simply used this rightful execution to start a rebellion against Rome by claiming the person that they had just killed was the Son of God. .... and that Rome could very easily understand that motivation, Karen says with a smirk. I don't know what her motivation is, but that is probably the least probable scenario I could imagine. The disciples were scattered and denying that the even knew Jesus... it isn't until after the resurrection that they believe that He is more than a mere man. And when they come to that conclusion, they do nothing to lead a rebellion against Rome. There is no mention of this later on when the Romans wage war against the Jewish people for actual insurrections. Again, just shotty scholarship, very poorly produced. Extrememly bad editorial decision making.Strangely... and this again goes against Lyn Goldfarb and Margaret Koval... later in the historical coverage (in a different ""show"" taping) it is a section on Greek philosophy of Stoicism. They are covering it fairly well and then they say how Seneca was concerned about teaching about brotherly love and care for others. Then they add (n the very next phrase)""years before Christians came up with the idea."" What!? What was that for? They weren't even mentioning Christians... but now, when they are talking about Greek Philosophy, the producers feel it necessary to say that their philosophy of love came years before the Christians??? Why?Now, if that weren't ridiculous on its own merit, consider one small point about this: The concept to love your neighbor as yourself is actually a Jewish command that was in circulation years before Stoicism was formulated. So, the one-off stab at ""stoicism is better"" seems really empty when one considers it was a Jewish concept that was simply brought over to Christian ethics. Either way, however, who cares who was first!? Just seems like the production and direction was really weak and that somebody in the production / directing leadership thought it perfectly fine to take some stabs at Christianity, regardless of the accuracy. Or so it seemed to me.There was also some needless stabs at Roman men (that just seemed oddly placed) and a whole lot of lauding of Roman women. Here, I can certainly understand that women need their due. I really liked hearing about the women in their historical context.Overall, I think that Lyn Goldfarb and Margaret Koval hurt their own effort to produce a quality, engaging historical documentary due to these choices and perhaps their own philosophical leanings. Everyone has their ""leanings"" but most are clever enough to balance those ideas so that they don't become hurtful to their stated goal. If you share Goldfarb and Koval's ideas, then you probably won't be bothered by it.",2,"Interesting Historical overview, but with hampered needlessly",1370044800,"06 1, 2013",2013,5408,"['Overall',

I was wondering where they got some of their information because I know a lot about Roman history in general from college, some was taken from the historian Josephius but others seem to be questionable. It wasn't until they reached the period of Christianity that I was floored. I realize this was a historical documentary and I took it as such, it was not a religious documentary. But the difference in the sympathetic feelings towards other religious sects that the Romans persecuted and the obvious contempt for Christianity is almost bewildering. It was so hard not to be extremely offended as a Christian even for a historical documentary. Karen King who teaches at Harvard was without a doubt the worst historian I've ever heard. She brought up a couple New Testament passages and then said Jesus got what he deserved. For instance she says ""A young follower came to follow Jesus but said he had to bury his parents first, Jesus would not allow this and said let the dead bury the dead."" What???? I'm fascinated by any history from this era since so little is known but Karen King's obvious resentment towards Christianity made me question the veracity of the whole documentary. I was really disappointed to know this garbage was aired on PBS. Can you imagine if the same was said about Mohammed or Abraham? I hate that they ruined the documentary with such utter nonsense. Regardless of what Ms. King thinks of Jesus our world was changed forever historically and religiously by His words.

During that time, the Jews, who were under Roman rule, threatened to riot if the Romans didn't execute Jesus. At first, Pontius Pilate refused. When faced with a mass riot by the Jews, which was the last thing Rome needed at the time, Pontius Pilate ""washed his hands"" of the whole mess and gave the JEWS permission to do what they wanted, The Jews then used Roman executioners to kill Jesus. Jesus was killed because the Jews demanded it. TWICE in this documentary, when the killing of Christ was mentioned, it is stated that the Romans killed Jesus. The JEWS killed Jesus and in the last 50 years the media continuously lies about who killed Jesus. So much so, that this lie prompted Mel Gibson to make the movie ""The Passion of the Christ"" which tells the true story of who killed Christ. I remember when he was making that film, the Hollywood moguls would NOT let him make it in Hollywood. He used his own money and made the film anyway. I also remember people of Jewish background picketing movie theatres because they were so against the film. The film shows the facts. Jesus, who was Jewish, claimed he was the Messiah. He was around for 33 years. Only when he went into the Jewish temples and threw tables over and told the Jews that they were living in sin for the business practices going on in the temples (borrowing and lending money etc.) did they want him dead. They demanded it of the Romans, Pilate looked the other way to avoid a riot (washed his hands of the whole mess as the Bible states) and allowed the Jews to kill Jesus. There are many other incorrect ""facts"" and outright lies in this documentary, but the two instances where they state that the Romans condemned Jesus to death, are pathetic lies and re-writing of history.",1,RE-WRITING HISTORY,1377302400,"08 24, 2013",2013,1839,"['historian', 'worth', 'weight', 'Roman', 'Empire', 'Romans', 'ruled', 'Judea', 'time', 'Jews', 'who', 'were', 'Roman', 'rule', 'threatened', 'riot', 'Romans', 'did', ""n't"", 'execute', 'Jesus', 'first', 'Pontius', 'Pilate', 'refused', 'When', 'faced', 'mass', 'riot', 'Jews', 'was', 'last', 'thing', 'Rome', 'needed', 'time', 'Pontius', 'Pilate', 'washed', 'hands', 'whole', 'mess', 'gave', 'JEWS', 'permission', 'do', 'what', 'wanted', 'Jews', 'then', 'used', 'Roman', 'executioners', 'kill', 'Jesus', 'Jesus', 'was', 'killed', 'Jews', 'demanded', 'TWICE', 'documentary', 'when', 'killing', 'Christ', 'was', 'mentioned', 'stated', 'Romans', 'killed', 'Jesus', 'JEWS', 'killed', 'Jesus', 'last', '50', 'years', 'media', 'continuously', 'who', 'killed', 'Jesus', 'So', 'much', 'lie', 'prompted', 'Mel', 'Gibson', 'make', 'movie', 'Passion', 'Christ', 'true', 'story', 'who', 'killed', 'Christ', 'remember', 'when', 'was', 'making', 'film', 'Hollywood', 'moguls', 'would', 'NOT', 'let', 'make', 'Hollywood', 'used', 'own', 'money', 'made', 'film', 'anyway', 'also', 'remember', 'people', 'Jewish', 'background', 'picketing', 'movie', 'theatres', 'were', 'so', 'film', 'film', 'facts', 'Jesus', 'who', 'was', 'Jewish', 'claimed', 'was', 'Messiah', 'was', 'around', '33', 'years', 'Only', 'when', 'went', 'Jewish', 'temples', 'threw', 'tables', 'told', 'Jews', 'were', 'living', 'sin', 'business', 'practices', 'going', 'temples', 'borrowing', 'lending', 'money', 'etc', 'did', 'want', 'dead', 'demanded', 'Romans', 'Pilate', 'looked', 'other', 'way', 'avoid', 'riot', 'washed', 'hands', 'whole', 'mess', 'Bible', 'states', 'allowed', 'Jews', 'kill', 'Jesus', 'are', 'many', 'other', 'incorrect', 'facts', 'outright', 'lies', 'documentary', 'two', 'instances', 'where', 'state', 'Romans', 'condemned', 'Jesus', 'death', 'are', 'pathetic', 'lies', 're-writing', 'history']",Empires - The Roman Empire in the First Century
