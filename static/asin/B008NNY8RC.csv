1571855,A3HLRR2FL9E5DP,B008NNY8RC,Brian,"[1, 1]","I was not expecting to enjoy this as much as I did.You can ask anybody in New Jersey, and they will probably tell you. The legend of the Jersey Devil, a nightmarish creature that is rumored to live within the dense Pine Barrens of Southern New Jersey, has been around for over 400 years. The story of it has, within that time, attained the same level of mysticism that currently surrounds the oft-mentioned folklores of Bigfoot and the Loch Ness Monster.The most accepted origin of the tale, at least as far the residents of New Jersey are concerned, began with Mother Leeds and reads as follows:&#34;It was said that Mother Leeds had 13 children and, after giving birth to her 12th child, stated that if she had another, it would be the Devil. In 1735, Mother Leeds was in labor on a stormy night. Gathered around her were her friends. Mother Leeds was supposedly a witch and the child's father was the Devil himself. The child was born normal, but then changed form. It changed from a normal baby to a creature with hooves, a horse's head, bat wings and a forked tail. It growled and screamed, then killed the midwife before flying up the chimney. It circled the villages and headed toward the pines. In 1740 a clergy exorcised the demon for 100 years and it wasn't seen again until 1890.&#34;That, in a nutshell, is the basic setup for &#34;The Barrens,&#34; the latest feature film by Director Darren Lynn Bousman. Mr. Bousman, who some horror fans might remember from his contributions to the &#34;Saw&#34; franchise, trades graphic gore and massive body counts for a far more subtle and effectively eerie psychological character study. The screenplay focuses upon a man-(Stephen Moyer from HBO's popular &#34;True Blood&#34; vampire series)-who, within the downward spiral of a full-fledged mental collapse, becomes convinced that he and his family are being stalked while camping in the Pine Barrens by the legendary Jersey Devil.Moyer, who is using his native British accent here, channels Jack Nicholson from &#34;The Shining&#34; as, little by little, his grasp on reality and his very sanity slowly begins to flake away. Bousman does a uniform job at breaking down the reason for Moyer's decline, so much to the point where you're actually wondering whether anything he's witnessing is the real deal or all in his head. And that, believe it or not, is what really helps sell this movie. It keeps you riveted straight through to the very end.And, what an ending! The payoff it rewards you with is so worth it in ways I dare not spoil. It was enough of a pleasant surprise to motivate me towards adding &#34;The Barrens&#34; to my ever-blossoming Blu-Ray collection.As video releases go, the Blu-Ray isn't all bad. The picture quality ranks right up there with the very best. There are no special features to speak of, unfortunately, not even a behind-the-scenes featurette; something I had actually wanted to see. But you do get a deleted scene, an alternate add-on to the existing ending that I personally feel should have been restored, and a running commentary by Bousman, himself.A rather cool and catchy opening tune by Kevin Welch, too, I must say.I am and always have been a rabid fan of any and all things horror, and I was very pleased with the way this film played out. To anyone who may, for whatever reason, be on the fence about watching it, I say: go for it! It's a welcome change of pace, especially if you're in the mood for something different.",3,A passable little thriller,1361577600,"02 23, 2013",2013,3471,"['was', 'not', 'expecting', 'enjoy', 'as', 'much', 'did.You', 'can', 'ask', 'anybody', 'New', 'Jersey', 'will', 'probably', 'tell', 'legend', 'Jersey', 'Devil', 'nightmarish', 'creature', 'rumored', 'live', 'dense', 'Pine', 'Barrens', 'Southern', 'New', 'Jersey', 'been', '400', 'years', 'story', 'time', 'attained', 'same', 'level', 'mysticism', 'currently', 'oft-mentioned', 'folklores', 'Bigfoot', 'Loch', 'Ness', 'Monster.The', 'most', 'accepted', 'origin', 'tale', 'least', 'far', 'residents', 'New', 'Jersey', 'are', 'concerned', 'began', 'Mother', 'Leeds', 'reads', '34', 'was', 'said', 'Mother', 'Leeds', 'had', '13', 'children', 'giving', 'birth', '12th', 'child', 'stated', 'had', 'would', 'be', 'Devil', '1735', 'Mother', 'Leeds', 'was', 'labor', 'stormy', 'night', 'Gathered', 'were', 'friends', 'Mother', 'Leeds', 'was', 'supposedly', 'witch', 'child', 'father', 'was', 'Devil', 'child', 'was', 'born', 'normal', 'then', 'changed', 'form', 'changed', 'normal', 'baby', 'creature', 'hooves', 'horse', 'head', 'bat', 'wings', 'forked', 'tail', 'growled', 'screamed', 'then', 'killed', 'midwife', 'flying', 'up', 'chimney', 'circled', 'villages', 'headed', 'pines', '1740', 'clergy', 'exorcised', 'demon', '100', 'years', 'was', ""n't"", 'seen', 'again', '1890.', '34', 'nutshell', 'basic', 'setup', '34', 'Barrens', '34', 'latest', 'feature', 'film', 'Director', 'Darren', 'Lynn', 'Bousman', 'Mr.', 'Bousman', 'who', 'horror', 'fans', 'might', 'remember', 'contributions', '34', 'Saw', '34', 'franchise', 'trades', 'graphic', 'gore', 'massive', 'body', 'counts', 'far', 'more', 'subtle', 'effectively', 'eerie', 'psychological', 'character', 'study', 'screenplay', 'man-', 'Stephen', 'Moyer', 'HBO', 'popular', '34', 'True', 'Blood', '34', 'vampire', 'series', '-who', 'downward', 'spiral', 'full-fledged', 'mental', 'collapse', 'convinced', 'family', 'are', 'being', 'stalked', 'camping', 'Pine', 'Barrens', 'legendary', 'Jersey', 'Devil.Moyer', 'who', 'using', 'native', 'British', 'accent', 'here', 'channels', 'Jack', 'Nicholson', '34', 'Shining', '34', 'little', 'little', 'grasp', 'reality', 'very', 'sanity', 'slowly', 'flake', 'away', 'Bousman', 'uniform', 'job', 'breaking', 'down', 'reason', 'Moyer', 'decline', 'so', 'much', 'point', 'where', ""'re"", 'actually', 'wondering', 'anything', 'witnessing', 'real', 'deal', 'head', 'believe', 'not', 'what', 'really', 'sell', 'movie', 'riveted', 'straight', 'very', 'end.And', 'what', 'ending', 'payoff', 'so', 'worth', 'ways', 'dare', 'not', 'spoil', 'was', 'enough', 'pleasant', 'surprise', 'motivate', 'adding', '34', 'Barrens', '34', 'ever-blossoming', 'Blu-Ray', 'collection.As', 'video', 'releases', 'go', 'Blu-Ray', ""n't"", 'bad', 'picture', 'quality', 'ranks', 'right', 'up', 'there', 'very', 'best', 'are', 'special', 'features', 'speak', 'unfortunately', 'not', 'even', 'behind-the-scenes', 'featurette', 'something', 'had', 'actually', 'wanted', 'see', 'do', 'get', 'deleted', 'scene', 'alternate', 'add-on', 'existing', 'ending', 'personally', 'feel', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'restored', 'running', 'commentary', 'Bousman', 'himself.A', 'rather', 'cool', 'catchy', 'opening', 'tune', 'Kevin', 'Welch', 'too', 'must', 'say.I', 'am', 'always', 'have', 'been', 'rabid', 'fan', 'things', 'horror', 'was', 'very', 'pleased', 'way', 'film', 'played', 'out', 'anyone', 'who', 'may', 'reason', 'be', 'fence', 'watching', 'say', 'go', 'welcome', 'change', 'pace', 'especially', ""'re"", 'mood', 'something', 'different']","Barrens, The"

Could the legend of the Jersey Devil really be true, or is some other force responsible for the mysterious deaths in THE BARRENS? Darren Lynn Bousman presents his take on the Jersey Devil myth in this bloody new thriller, which is no less forgettable than the other attempts that have already been made on the story. The main issue lies in the over-dramatized lead performance by Stephen Moyer, who becomes increasingly unbearable as father figure Richard Vineyard. None of the snotty teenagers in the supporting cast help to make things any better. Bousman also adds several irrelevant twists that only serve to confuse and complicate an otherwise simple plot. When the creature is finally revealed, it looks like a mangled mess of animal parts and shabby animatronics. Even the flashy editing gives a sense of cheapness to the look of the film, which is quite unusual for the otherwise talented director.

There is nothing groundbreaking about a movie about a family being stuck in the woods, but the tension and conflicts between the characters are well executed, the movie has a brisk pace to it, and generally the story is pretty solid.The performances by te cast are hit-or-miss, with the dependable Mia Kirshner being one of the bright spots. The film nearly gets sidetracked in the middle by focusing too heavily on the family dynamic, and yes, of course the family members occasionally do irrational things, but that's just the case with these types of movies. I mean, let's face it, if you've purchased or rented a movie about the Jersey Devil, you should be prepared to suspend disbelief a little.If you're looking for an entertaining film that won't make you think too much, especially if it's just a cheap rental, then this makes for a decent return on your investment. It won't make you yell at the screen too much, but the suspense will keep you focused on the screen until the end, and that's what a thriller like this one is designed to do.

That's exactly how I felt when the credits rolled on Darren Lynn Bousman's ""The Barrens."" This is the perfect example of a film whose beginning and end shine but the middle just drags on for too long. After seeing what Bousman did with ""Mother's Day,"" I really expected more from his next outing.Richard Vineyard (Stephen Moyer) needs a little time off from his busy life and the trappings of modern civilization. He takes his family on a camping trip to the pine forests of New Jersey called the Barrens. His father used to take him there as a boy. Richard wants to honor his father's wishes by scattering his ashes throughout the area. Upon arriving at their campsite, they are bombarded with stories about a creature spawned from Satan named the Jersey Devil. Richard becomes convinced the monster is hunting his family and the other campers down as gutted bodies start turning up.I have no complaints when it comes to the picture quality of the film. ""The Barrens"" looks great and the cinematography successfully captures the gloomy and massive expanse of the forest. The creature itself is shot close-up to give us a glimpse of what it looks like but never delivers full body shots until the climax of the film. Obviously a mix of practical and CGI effects were used to capture the actions of the Jersey Devil and it looks realistic no matter what angle it's shot in.The movie's 5.1 surround sound mix guarantees viewers that all the sudden jerks of the musical score, loud screams, trees rustling, and gunshots are projected all over your home theater. You feel like you're actually in the forest with the Vineyard family. This helps pull the audience into the film and make them feel like they're living it.The only bonus material we get for ""The Barrens"" Blu-ray is audio commentary by Writer / Director Darren Lynn Bousman and Director of Photography Joseph White. A deleted scene offers an alternate ending for the movie. Commentary is provided by Bousman in regards to the deleted scene as well.

1571869,A2DAHERP7HYJGO,B008NNY8RC,Mark Turner,"[1, 2]","As I started to write this week's column I was going to write about ROCK OF AGES. Then I thought why waste the space on something I didn't like much (although it did make me want to go seek out the music in my collection) when I could write about a small movie that was better? And more qualified for the Halloween season as well.THE BARRENS, as some of you already know, is a wooded area in New Jersey set aside for camping and such. It's also well known for the existence of a creature known as the Jersey Devil. This winged man like creature has supposedly stalked the woods for decades and paranormal investigators have sought it out for years. So it only makes sense that a horror film concern itself with the area.Richard Vineyard (Stephen Moyer) is a father and new husband trying to unite his family. His daughter Sadie is at that age where everything is about rebellion. Tie that in with her rejection of her stepmother Cynthia (Mia Kirshner) feeling she's trying to replace her deceased mother and the son Richard and Cynthia had together, Danny, she's the typical annoying character that you hope learns about reality before the film ends. To bring this family together, Richard has decided that they are going camping in the Barrens, the place where his father took him when he was young.As they prepare for the trip Richard seems distracted, at times even fearful of the trip even though he initiated it. Memories of his childhood in the woods seem to have a haunted moment that he can't quite remember. But the family heads out to the woods for a camping weekend. Along the way, upset that the family can't leave their gadgets behind for just a few days, he tells his wife to put away the cell phone and his daughter to take off the Ipod. This weekend is about nature.The family arrives and sets up camp but its nothing like Richard remembers. Instead of the isolated campground that he recalled there are tons of families here for the weekend. When he finds his daughter flirting with a young man in the campground area, he insists that they move deeper into the woods to be more secluded.As the trip proceeds Richard gets more distracted, breaking out in a sweat and behaving unusual. It isn't until later that the cause is revealed, at least part of it. Is there something physically wrong with Richard? Something mentally disturbing? Or is he truly the victim of the Jersey Devil whose story is told around the campfire one night?It's these questions and watching to find clues for the answer that make this film work so well. You never know if there is something creeping in the woods or if Richard has lost it. As bodies begin to turn up gutted, torn to shreds, you remember Richard playing with his knife and start to consider he's gone mad. Then again perhaps it was this creature that shredded its victims. The final solution to the mystery should satisfy everyone.The movie builds up at a slow pace, increasing the tension as you watch. You not only fear what will happen to those around this family but what will happen to the family itself. Each actor does a wonderful job in the roles given but Moyers stands out as the head of the house that seems to be just tipping over the edge with each scene. Every supporting actor does a great job as well convincingly playing victims of one kind or another.One negative note that can be corrected. Included in the film is an alternate ending. While watching that I felt that it should have been tacked on as well. It would have made the ending of the film better even though it's still got enough surprises to hold your interest until the end.",3,IS IT THE JERSEY DEVIL?,1352764800,"11 13, 2012",2012,3612,"['started', 'write', 'week', 'column', 'was', 'going', 'write', 'ROCK', 'OF', 'AGES', 'Then', 'thought', 'why', 'waste', 'space', 'something', 'did', ""n't"", 'like', 'much', 'did', 'make', 'want', 'go', 'seek', 'out', 'music', 'collection', 'when', 'could', 'write', 'small', 'movie', 'was', 'better', 'more', 'qualified', 'Halloween', 'season', 'well.THE', 'BARRENS', 'already', 'know', 'wooded', 'area', 'New', 'Jersey', 'set', 'aside', 'camping', 'such', 'also', 'well', 'known', 'existence', 'creature', 'known', 'Jersey', 'Devil', 'winged', 'man', 'creature', 'supposedly', 'stalked', 'woods', 'decades', 'paranormal', 'investigators', 'have', 'sought', 'out', 'years', 'only', 'sense', 'horror', 'film', 'concern', 'area.Richard', 'Vineyard', 'Stephen', 'Moyer', 'father', 'new', 'husband', 'trying', 'unite', 'family', 'daughter', 'Sadie', 'age', 'where', 'everything', 'rebellion', 'Tie', 'rejection', 'stepmother', 'Cynthia', 'Mia', 'Kirshner', 'feeling', 'trying', 'replace', 'deceased', 'mother', 'son', 'Richard', 'Cynthia', 'had', 'together', 'Danny', 'typical', 'annoying', 'character', 'hope', 'learns', 'reality', 'film', 'bring', 'family', 'together', 'Richard', 'decided', 'are', 'going', 'camping', 'Barrens', 'place', 'where', 'father', 'took', 'when', 'was', 'young.As', 'prepare', 'trip', 'Richard', 'distracted', 'times', 'even', 'fearful', 'trip', 'even', 'initiated', 'Memories', 'childhood', 'woods', 'seem', 'have', 'haunted', 'moment', 'ca', ""n't"", 'quite', 'remember', 'family', 'out', 'woods', 'camping', 'weekend', 'way', 'upset', 'family', 'ca', ""n't"", 'leave', 'gadgets', 'just', 'few', 'days', 'wife', 'put', 'away', 'cell', 'phone', 'daughter', 'take', 'off', 'Ipod', 'weekend', 'nature.The', 'family', 'arrives', 'up', 'camp', 'nothing', 'Richard', 'remembers', 'Instead', 'isolated', 'campground', 'recalled', 'are', 'tons', 'families', 'here', 'weekend', 'When', 'daughter', 'flirting', 'young', 'man', 'campground', 'area', 'move', 'deeper', 'woods', 'be', 'more', 'secluded.As', 'trip', 'proceeds', 'Richard', 'more', 'distracted', 'breaking', 'out', 'sweat', 'behaving', 'unusual', ""n't"", 'later', 'cause', 'revealed', 'least', 'part', 'there', 'something', 'physically', 'wrong', 'Richard', 'Something', 'mentally', 'disturbing', 'truly', 'victim', 'Jersey', 'Devil', 'story', 'told', 'campfire', 'one', 'night', 'questions', 'watching', 'find', 'clues', 'answer', 'make', 'film', 'work', 'so', 'well', 'never', 'know', 'something', 'creeping', 'woods', 'Richard', 'lost', 'bodies', 'begin', 'turn', 'up', 'gutted', 'torn', 'shreds', 'remember', 'Richard', 'playing', 'knife', 'start', 'consider', 'gone', 'mad', 'Then', 'again', 'perhaps', 'was', 'creature', 'shredded', 'victims', 'final', 'solution', 'mystery', 'should', 'satisfy', 'everyone.The', 'movie', 'up', 'slow', 'pace', 'increasing', 'tension', 'watch', 'not', 'only', 'fear', 'what', 'will', 'happen', 'family', 'what', 'will', 'happen', 'family', 'actor', 'wonderful', 'job', 'roles', 'given', 'Moyers', 'out', 'head', 'house', 'be', 'just', 'tipping', 'over', 'edge', 'scene', 'supporting', 'actor', 'great', 'job', 'as', 'well', 'convincingly', 'playing', 'victims', 'one', 'kind', 'another.One', 'negative', 'note', 'can', 'be', 'corrected', 'Included', 'film', 'alternate', 'ending', 'watching', 'felt', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'tacked', 'as', 'well', 'would', 'have', 'made', 'ending', 'film', 'better', 'even', 'still', 'got', 'enough', 'surprises', 'hold', 'interest', 'end']","Barrens, The"

1571876,A557559XPTL6D,B008NNY8RC,Stephen O'Blenis,"[0, 0]","When a family of four, beset of late by the kind of normal familial angst that crops up every once in a while, heads out for a weekend of family bonding in the New Jersey Barrens, things are about to get a whole lot worse, not better.  The Barrens, reputedly the home of the Jersey Devil, a legendary bat-winged creature, is full of campers and not conducive to the kind of away time the father of the family (Stephen Moyer) wants, so he leads them deeper into the woods, off the regular trail of tourists.  Here things get dark.Strange things start happening and the family feels like they're being stalked.  But is it the Jersey Devil, or are some of the fellow campers more dangerous than they seem, or is the threat closer still?  As the movie unfolds, you realize that certain events are not necessarily 'real', but may be in one of the character's heads.  I find that, usually when a movie does this kind of thing, it doesn't work well.  If a character is unsure, for example, whether the house is really haunted or not, that's fine.  But when we, the viewers, are left unsure whether certain events are even happening or exist largely or only in the imagination of a character, whether they're really seeing things or if the things they see are hallucinations, it usually doesn't work.  The Barrens is one of the exceptions where it does work well.  It actually heightens the suspense and tension as characters are unsure whether they can believe what they're seeing, and as they don't know who to trust while the sanity of certain characters is in question.  To give you an idea of what I mean, and whether you're going to like this, I feel that movies that end with 'it was just a dream' or something like that usually don't work that well.  On the other hand, in the originalPhantasmit was unclear what was real and what wasn't, and that was an excellent movie; and inThe Usual Suspects (Special Edition)it was unclear what events being related in the accounts of various characters was real and what they were making up, and that worked well too.  Those are two very different movies from each other and from The Barrens, but they (I feel) give good examples that a story loaded with the ""what's real and what isn't?"" aspect can work out very well some of the time.The Barrens DOES eventually answer most of its own questions, but it's only after going through a twisting, turning, ultra-intense road of uncertainties.

Richard (Moyer) is a father who can feel his family slipping away. They don't do anything together anymore so he decides to pack them all up and drive them out to the woods where he went as a kid for a weekend camping trip. When they get there the hear of a missing person. Richard begins to wonder if the stories he heard about the Jersey Devil are true. This is a movie for true horror fans only. The movie is pretty slow and not very original but on the other hand it is a very neat idea. The biggest problem with this is that once again the idea of the movie is better then the movie itself. The idea of the Jersey Devil is something that is made for a horror movie, but to me this one was just to slow and not really scary enough to fully expand on the ""legend"" of the devil. This movie really just boiled down to a family going crazy in the woods, which has been done over and over. Fans of the ""Hunters"" or even ""Wrong Turn"" may like this but to me it was just too slow and un-original to fully enjoy. Overall, another movie that had a really good idea but ended up being a cookie cutter horror movie. I give it a C+.",2,A very cool idea but like most movies lately the idea is better then the movie.
