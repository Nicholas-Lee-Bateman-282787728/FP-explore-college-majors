A Very British Gangster was an exceptional documentary that revealed the full complexity of a man whose life seems to have already been decided. We discover at the end of it that he is going back to jail but his attitude and everything about his character suggest that his final destination is a foregone conclusion. The police follow him everywhere and it's quite likely that the filmmaker was not the only individual who recorded many of these conversations. What we find most is that Dominic Noonan is, in many ways, a normal man with a variety of relationships and concerns that must be negotiated. Most of his criminality is merely hinted at here, but it seems very unlikely that--even if he is re-released--he will conjure up the will to change his life. This is an endearing and well-crafted portrait of a doomed man.",5,A Very Sterling Film,1230249600,"12 26, 2008",2008,966,"['being', 'American', ""'m"", 'very', 'interested', 'England', 'am', 'bit', 'Anglophile', 'generally', 'gravitate', 'towards', 'country', 'films', 'Very', 'British', 'Gangster', 'was', 'exceptional', 'documentary', 'revealed', 'full', 'complexity', 'man', 'life', 'have', 'already', 'been', 'decided', 'discover', 'end', 'going', 'back', 'jail', 'attitude', 'everything', 'character', 'suggest', 'final', 'destination', 'foregone', 'conclusion', 'police', 'follow', 'everywhere', 'quite', 'likely', 'filmmaker', 'was', 'not', 'only', 'individual', 'who', 'recorded', 'many', 'conversations', 'What', 'find', 'most', 'Dominic', 'Noonan', 'many', 'ways', 'normal', 'man', 'variety', 'relationships', 'concerns', 'must', 'be', 'negotiated', 'Most', 'criminality', 'merely', 'hinted', 'here', 'very', 'unlikely', 'even', 're-released', 'will', 'conjure', 'up', 'will', 'change', 'life', 'endearing', 'well-crafted', 'portrait', 'doomed', 'man']",A Very British Gangster
1180212,A1TEMNM9ZEOLJ6,B001DF67XU,Bradley F. Smith,"[5, 7]","There's a real disconnect here between the violent lives led by the gangsters in this documentary and their seemingly benign personalities as depicted in the film. It's difficult to believe that the head gangster is as vicious as he is portrayed. Also, why would he allow a film crew in to see all that he does? There are seeming confessions to certain types of lawless bahaviour, so this was reckless of the gangsters involved. Still, you'll get a real look at the tawdry side of British criminal life. The characters all seem to be nearly subhuman in their criminality.

1180213,A33EN2ZL2MS0CI,B001DF67XU,Compay,"[1, 1]","A Very British Gangster is one of the most underrated and beautifully-shot crime documentaries available.  What distinguishes this documentary from most others is how it's directed.  Far from the typical gritty hand-held guerrilla style of documentary work, this film is filled with brilliant cinematography and effective crane shots.  The British rock soundtrack is an excellent backdrop to footage of the seedier sides of Manchester.Dominic is no Tony Soprano; despite the flashy suits and manicured appearance, his home life seems to be fairly working class.  Where Noonan loses credibility is with his entourage, which is almost exclusively made up of teenagers.  It calls into question not how dangerous Dominic is, but if he's as powerful as others make him out to be.It's still impossible to deny his family's reputation, as the film reveals Manchester's major reaction to the death of one the infamous Noonans.  His constant court appearances serve as a testament to his alleged criminal activity, and some of the things that this gangster confesses are shockingly honest and revealing.So while it's hard to say exactly where Dominic Noonan ranked on the totem pole of British gangsters, it's safe to say that this was a well-shot documentary.",4,Brilliantly Shot Crime Documentary,1269561600,"03 26, 2010",2010,1251,"['Very', 'British', 'Gangster', 'one', 'most', 'underrated', 'beautifully-shot', 'crime', 'documentaries', 'available', 'What', 'documentary', 'most', 'others', 'how', 'directed', 'Far', 'typical', 'gritty', 'hand-held', 'guerrilla', 'style', 'documentary', 'work', 'film', 'filled', 'brilliant', 'cinematography', 'effective', 'crane', 'shots', 'British', 'rock', 'soundtrack', 'excellent', 'backdrop', 'footage', 'seedier', 'sides', 'Manchester.Dominic', 'Tony', 'Soprano', 'flashy', 'suits', 'manicured', 'appearance', 'home', 'life', 'be', 'fairly', 'working', 'class', 'Where', 'Noonan', 'credibility', 'entourage', 'almost', 'exclusively', 'made', 'teenagers', 'question', 'not', 'how', 'dangerous', 'Dominic', 'as', 'powerful', 'others', 'make', 'be.It', 'still', 'impossible', 'deny', 'family', 'reputation', 'film', 'reveals', 'Manchester', 'major', 'reaction', 'death', 'one', 'infamous', 'Noonans', 'constant', 'court', 'appearances', 'serve', 'testament', 'alleged', 'criminal', 'activity', 'things', 'gangster', 'confesses', 'are', 'shockingly', 'honest', 'revealing.So', 'hard', 'say', 'exactly', 'where', 'Dominic', 'Noonan', 'ranked', 'totem', 'pole', 'British', 'gangsters', 'safe', 'say', 'was', 'well-shot', 'documentary']",A Very British Gangster

1180217,A18S2VGUH9SCV5,B001DF67XU,Margaux Paschke,"[1, 2]","I was amazed at this well rounded documentary of an English crime boss. In this film we meet Dominick Noonan (a member of a powerful crime family in Manchester, England) and learn the story of his life through his own words, judicious editing and clever interviewing.  At first, Noonan seems like the type of guy you'd like to have a few pints with as he tells these amazing tales in an engaging manner.  But you then remember his stories are facts, not tales, and sometimes involve grisly violence.This film does an amazing job of picturing Dominick as an amiable fellow one moment and in the next, flashes of the brutal man underneath.  I have no idea how the BBC journalist, Donal MacIntyre, got the amount of access he did to this lifestyle without consequences.My only complaint is that the dvd extras were deleted scenes and I would have preferred to see a commentary of this extraordinary film.",5,A COMPELLING DOCUMENTARY OF A REAL CRIME BOSS,1253923200,"09 26, 2009",2009,901,"['was', 'amazed', 'well', 'rounded', 'documentary', 'English', 'crime', 'boss', 'film', 'meet', 'Dominick', 'Noonan', 'member', 'powerful', 'crime', 'family', 'Manchester', 'England', 'learn', 'story', 'life', 'own', 'words', 'judicious', 'editing', 'clever', 'interviewing', 'first', 'Noonan', 'type', 'guy', ""'d"", 'like', 'have', 'few', 'pints', 'amazing', 'tales', 'engaging', 'manner', 'then', 'remember', 'stories', 'are', 'facts', 'not', 'tales', 'sometimes', 'involve', 'grisly', 'violence.This', 'film', 'amazing', 'job', 'picturing', 'Dominick', 'amiable', 'fellow', 'one', 'moment', 'next', 'flashes', 'brutal', 'man', 'underneath', 'have', 'idea', 'how', 'BBC', 'journalist', 'Donal', 'MacIntyre', 'got', 'amount', 'access', 'did', 'lifestyle', 'consequences.My', 'only', 'complaint', 'dvd', 'extras', 'were', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'would', 'have', 'preferred', 'see', 'commentary', 'extraordinary', 'film']",A Very British Gangster
