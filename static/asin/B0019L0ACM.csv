1163598,A1ZWDTXSH1ZV8E,B0019L0ACM,B. Martin,"[4, 10]","I think the level of enjoyment one takes away from this low budget indie comedy is directly related to just how funny you find Danny McBride.  Personally, I don't get his brand of humor.  I didn't find him particularly funny in Tropic Thunder and the same holds true for his current HBO series, East Bound and Down.  McBride has one type of character that he can play:  narcassistic, self deluded, arrogant white trash.  I guess it's fair to say that he plays it well, it's just not funny.So I decided to give McBride another chance and check out the movie that gave him his start.  The Foot Fist Way finds McBride playing his patented character type yet again (think of him as a white trash version of The Office's David Brent, only with no redeeming qualities).  He runs a tae kwan do dojo where he insturcts and belittles students of all ages.  When his wife cheats on him, his entire world is shaken up so he sets off on a road trip to see his martial arts hero, Chuck ""The Truck"" Wallace.As you can probably imagine, nothing goes the way McBride's character intends in this movie.  Chuck Wallace turns out to be even more of a self absorbed jerk than McBride and his marriage ends up falling into more dissaray than before.I wish I had more to say about this movie.  Despite its 82 minute running time, it feels glacier paced.  It is painfully unfunny in just about every aspect.  McBride certainly has a gift for creating an all too believable version of whte trash, but that really doesn't matter when you're not laughing.",1,No laughs to be had,1237766400,"03 23, 2009",2009,1529,"['think', 'level', 'enjoyment', 'one', 'away', 'low', 'budget', 'indie', 'comedy', 'directly', 'related', 'just', 'how', 'funny', 'find', 'Danny', 'McBride', 'Personally', 'do', ""n't"", 'get', 'brand', 'humor', 'did', ""n't"", 'find', 'particularly', 'funny', 'Tropic', 'Thunder', 'same', 'true', 'current', 'HBO', 'series', 'East', 'Bound', 'Down', 'McBride', 'one', 'type', 'character', 'can', 'play', 'narcassistic', 'deluded', 'arrogant', 'white', 'trash', 'guess', 'fair', 'say', 'well', 'just', 'not', 'funny.So', 'decided', 'give', 'McBride', 'chance', 'check', 'out', 'movie', 'gave', 'start', 'Foot', 'Fist', 'Way', 'McBride', 'playing', 'patented', 'character', 'type', 'yet', 'again', 'think', 'white', 'trash', 'version', 'Office', 'David', 'Brent', 'only', 'redeeming', 'qualities', 'tae', 'kwan', 'do', 'dojo', 'where', 'students', 'ages', 'When', 'wife', 'cheats', 'entire', 'world', 'shaken', 'up', 'so', 'off', 'road', 'trip', 'see', 'martial', 'arts', 'hero', 'Chuck', 'Truck', 'can', 'probably', 'imagine', 'nothing', 'way', 'McBride', 'character', 'movie', 'Chuck', 'Wallace', 'out', 'be', 'even', 'more', 'self', 'absorbed', 'jerk', 'McBride', 'marriage', 'up', 'falling', 'more', 'dissaray', 'before.I', 'wish', 'had', 'more', 'say', 'movie', '82', 'minute', 'running', 'time', 'glacier', 'paced', 'painfully', 'unfunny', 'just', 'aspect', 'McBride', 'certainly', 'gift', 'creating', 'too', 'believable', 'version', 'whte', 'trash', 'really', ""n't"", 'matter', 'when', ""'re"", 'not', 'laughing']",The Foot Fist Way

Both involve a character on the trashy, obnoxious, athletically employed side. Eastbound & Down's variation is that the guy once hit it big.  This character will never hit it big.  There is another variation. The marital problem here is dead serious.  He is married to a woman who looks and acts like a two bit hooker. I thought he did a marvelous, very credible job of playing a guy who keeps deluding himself about the woman he married until he no longer can. That was the best part of the movie for me.  It showed another side to McBride's talent.  Yes, he does play some aspects of it for laughs but he really shows his acting chops here as the cuckold. All this said, one viewing was enough.

It's not so much that the jokes fell flat, it's that they had a good joke that just kept repeating over and over. The basic joke is that the incompetent taekwondo instructor turns child-bully as he struggles through the parts of his life that really aren't solveable by violence. As the main character just became more and more of a bully and less and less of a warm, comical, likeable character, I basically stopped caring about him and what happens to him in this movie. By the half way point I couldn't help but think the character just deserved to have bad things happen to him, or that it didn't really matter what happened to him.

I had to purchase it elsewhere than from Amazon because it is still showing it as unavailable. So my first question is, ""What's up with that Amazon?""This is not a slick well thought out comedy performed by comedic geniuses such as; Robin Williams, Billy Crystal, Adam Sandler, etc. What it is, is a low budget extremely disturbing comedy featuring a relatively unknown actor who seems to nail this part down pat.Having a background in the legitimate martial art of Tae Kwon Do, and not the McDojo version which seems to be so prevalent today, I found this movie to be disturbingly funny, not so much because of the actors comedic ability, but the fact that I have actually seen this kind of instructor before, and not only once, but many times all over the country. And that really is a disturbingly scary thought.To say that this movie is destined to be a cult classic may be a bit much for the mainstream movie audience to understand, but I can definitely see that coming true in the years to come.The main character (played by Danny McBride) is an all too typical McDojo instructor whose main martial art that he teaches just happens to be Tae Kwon Do, although you could pretty much substitute any martial art in there and get pretty much the same results. His teaching style and ability are so absurdly funny that I actually had to watch this movie immediately after the first time because I was laughing so hard that I actually missed quite a bit of dialogue the first time. Which by the way only made me laugh even harder the second time when I could hear what I had missed the first time through.The average person, or even the martial artist that takes himself way too seriously, may not find this movie as funny as I did, and that is too bad because it really is quite good. Sure there is a lot of foul language thrown in and some really bad decisions made by the lead character, but that is part of the charm of this movie.The character of Chuck ""The Truck"" Wallace was exceptionally funny and I am chuckling even now as I attempt to finish this review. I found especially funny the relationship that the star has in this movie with his all too common wife and her little lapses in judgment. Look for the scene with the wife and Chuck ""The Truck"" when her husband gets home. Very funny!You may not find this movie as funny as I did, but what the heck, take a chance and sit down and watch it.
