1420369,AO1Z0TQWCRGL4,B004MYOX3K,"Harold Wolf ""Doc""","[11, 11]","Kathy Smith provides a set of short workouts that can be combined together as an individual's need demands. She offers a lively pace, but it is quite adaptable for the beginner or less robust uses. It is a vigorous challenge for any male or female, but as stated it can be adapted easily. For instance, When the pace is faster than I could maintain, I simply did fewer movements, but stuck with the same action. If a particular movement was painful or difficult, as I have a bad left hip, I simple used a lighter movement in that spot. Most of the time, I kept up and worked up a sweat. That's good. The young and healthy user will find this challenging yet fun.I'm 63 and still recovering from back surgery less than 6 months back. I've also had 2 heart attacks, the last 18 mo. ago. That proves this is a doable routine DVD set for all, but the younger and stronger and fitter people will surely easily maintain the pace that Kathy Smith offers. She is a peppy leader to follow, and her chat keeps the time lively as well. She is extremely encouraging to all participants, always suggesting smaller movements, or alternatives if her actions are too much for the day. Offers challenging add-ons for the very fittest exerciser.Each of the 4 15-minute segments go quickly. Personally, I combined 2 then followed with the 12 minute stretching segment for a total of 42 minutes a day. A younger person likely could do all 4 segments followed by some stretching. The 4 options of arms, legs, glutes, and core are easily interchangeable and can be used in any order with a click of the remote.The segments make use of a mat (I used the carpet), weights (Kathy used 5# & 8# while I only used 3#), cans of food also works, and the occasional use of a chair (I just used a dining table chair.) No fancy equipment needed. I was pleased to note that Kathy Smith's routines used basic movements that I was trained to use while having physical rehabilitation therapy after my heart attack and surgery. This is a solid program for strengthening, toning, and muscle building.An exercise DVD my wife and I have added to our DOABLE routine list. Now if we could just find that ""FOUNTAIN OF YOUTH"" DVD and turn back time about 2 decades. :)AGELESS with Kathy Smith is right on; any age, any level, very adaptable; and Kathy is such a cute, bubbly, energetic, encourager, on the screen.Worth the DVD price.

1420372,AFOE4LTYQ1ZBT,B004MYOX3K,"Khezla Durr ""Khezla Durr""","[11, 11]","What impressed me the most upon first viewing of this video was the seamless blend of a variety of exercise influences.  I recognized exercises ""stolen"" from the Lotte Berk Method as well as traditional gym style weight training, plus active recovery exercises without weight that were reminiscent of Jane Fonda's earliest work or elements of Tracy Anderson, who was influenced by Jane F.The cueing is excellent, as would be expected from an old pro like Kathy, and she kept things moving.  She gets a LOT done in only 15 minute so it's an efficient workout that moves briskly without feeling rushed.  I loved the fact that she had such a variety of exercises to offer so it's highly unlikely a person would get bored with the offerings, and I loved that she did not kill you with an ultra-high repetition count the way some instructors do.  I think a greater variety of exercises and fewer reps is healthier and leaves one less prone to injury.As for her personal demeanor, Kathy was encouraging without being fake, and I only heard 2 ""whoops"" out of her which is her most irritating mannerism, one that is generally used when she is showing off for visiting experts and class members.  In this video, she is by herself in a living room setting and I liked her much better in the way that she came across.You can do anything for 15 minutes, this should fit anybody's schedule and limited energy.

One of the main common threads running through each of SR's extraordinary chapter/story, I noticed especially, was the importance of exercise and fitness as a prerequisite to great lovemaking. Needless to say, that got my attention.Which leads me to number two: I discovered several great exercise DVDs and books specifically for seniors, including Kathy Smith's Staying Strong. It's for seniors, and the workouts take you from beginning to more advanced.

Smith provides good cuing, if not always accurate counting (a mistake common to many exercise videos, e.g. doing 14 reps on one arm and then 12 on the other), and the workouts are fast-paced and varied enough to combat a common critique of exercise routines: boredom.
