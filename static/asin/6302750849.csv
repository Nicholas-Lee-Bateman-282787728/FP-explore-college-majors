331229,A1HDP4OBFHIBX6,6302750849,"B. Hamilton ""Black Cat""","[1, 1]","This is an old-fashioned melodrama in the form of softcore erotica and I think it works really well.  I've been a fan of Zalman King's stuff forever and I think this is his best film.  The two main characters are conflicted and Severance's backstory is crucial to everyone's motivation.  I suppose it was not avoidable that the sex scenes were a little too long and more than a little overwrought, but that's just the nature of the genre.  The casting is perfect.  Severance is just a tiny bit long in the tooth but still attractive both clothed and otherwise and someone that female viewers can relate to better than some silicone caricature.  Zane is handsome and dangerous at the same time, which is perfect for an object of forbidden attraction.Most of us have some dark moment in our past that is both shameful and exciting.  It pops out of our subconscious unbidden and makes us wonder ""what if,"" but usually for only a moment.  Irene was literally swept away from her comfortable existence and given a chance to decide again which path to follow.  And for most of the film, it remains in the balance.  Pretty remarkable stuff for this kind of film and it might be why some people are less than happy with it -- it's neither fish nor fowl.But I like films that are different and in a plethora of ""Hi, I'm the plumber, let's go to bed, wakka chicka wakka chicka,"" Lake Consequence really stands out.

331230,A35YWA2V4QHOJ3,6302750849,"D. Roberts ""Hadrian12""","[4, 4]","This is Joan Severance's best-known role, and there is good reason why.  My goodness, she is absolutely captivating!  If ever there was a role where an actress could set the film on-fire, this is it.  She has a mysterious, demure beauty that so intoxicates me.  Wow!Joan portrays a bored housewife who is having a sort of mid-life crisis.  Her husband is a decent man, treats her well and she lives an upscale lifestyle.  However, she finds herself ""missing"" something in her life.  She starts to gravitate towards a penniless, buffed-up tree-trimmer (Billy Zane).  Eventually, she must choose between the fantasy & reality.To add to the dynamic, she suffered a traumatic sexual encounter as a teen that has left her scarred, confused and a bit twisted in the sexual sphere.  During the film, she discovers that there is more to her erotic dimension than she once thought.One of the most intriguing aspects of the plot is that the love-triangle differs from most.  In the majority of the movies of this type, the 3rd party (in this case, Zane's character) is trying to steal the woman away from her husband.  In this case, Zane's beneficent persona knows full-well that her husband will offer a much better life than what he is capable of.  And, he has a remorse for possibly interfering with her relationship w/her son.All in all, if (like me!) you're a fan of erotic movies which do not shy away from a surplus of nudity, then you can't do much better than this film!  There is an obvious symbolic gesture in the name of the lake where she pursues her fantasy;  in life, we will never be bereft of consequences for our actions.",5,I believe in consequences!,1232755200,"01 24, 2009",2009,1629,"['Joan', 'Severance', 'best-known', 'role', 'good', 'reason', 'why', 'goodness', 'absolutely', 'captivating', 'ever', 'was', 'role', 'where', 'actress', 'could', 'set', 'film', 'on-fire', 'mysterious', 'demure', 'beauty', 'so', 'Wow', 'Joan', 'bored', 'housewife', 'who', 'having', 'sort', 'mid-life', 'crisis', 'husband', 'decent', 'man', 'well', 'upscale', 'lifestyle', 'However', 'missing', 'something', 'life', 'gravitate', 'towards', 'penniless', 'buffed-up', 'tree-trimmer', 'Billy', 'Zane', 'Eventually', 'must', 'choose', 'fantasy', 'reality.To', 'add', 'dynamic', 'suffered', 'traumatic', 'sexual', 'encounter', 'teen', 'left', 'scarred', 'confused', 'bit', 'twisted', 'sexual', 'sphere', 'film', 'more', 'erotic', 'dimension', 'once', 'thought.One', 'most', 'intriguing', 'aspects', 'plot', 'love-triangle', 'differs', 'most', 'majority', 'movies', 'type', '3rd', 'party', 'case', 'Zane', 'character', 'trying', 'steal', 'woman', 'away', 'husband', 'case', 'Zane', 'beneficent', 'persona', 'full-well', 'husband', 'will', 'offer', 'much', 'better', 'life', 'what', 'capable', 'remorse', 'possibly', 'interfering', 'relationship', 'son.All', ""'re"", 'fan', 'erotic', 'movies', 'do', 'not', 'shy', 'away', 'surplus', 'nudity', 'then', 'ca', ""n't"", 'do', 'much', 'better', 'film', 'obvious', 'symbolic', 'gesture', 'name', 'lake', 'where', 'fantasy', 'life', 'will', 'never', 'be', 'bereft', 'consequences', 'actions']",N/A

Billy Zane (Titanic, Demon Knight), who's a cool dude, plays...uh, well Billy here, a landscaper who hangs out with his pals shirtless and what not attracting the attention of Irene. When Irene's husband takes their kid on a fishing trip for the weekend Irene takes her attentions to Billy as they spend time together and she eventually goes into his trailer in which she is trapped in the back as it drives off to a place called Lake Consequence. There Irene meets Billy's friend Grace, played by Mary Karasun or Holli L. Hummel (Red Shoe Diaries, Secret Games 3) whatever you wanna call her who appears nekkid swimming in the lake. Billy comes and finds Irene there. Billy takes Irene within a Chinese gathering into a place where him, Irene and Grave share a long and intimate time within a hottub..... water + bubbles + flesh + old chinese guys watching you do it, oh yeah, that's a good time right there. Irene tries to run away from it all and Billy wants to know what's up so she tells him about her past...which isnt pretty. It's not like other Zalman King movies in which every 5-10 minutes the people are nekkid and doing it. Severance is ok and Zane is Billy Zane...like I said he's a cool dude and Mary Karasun is lovely. Some of the acting is corny but if this is the type of movie you wanna watch and enjoy, then go right ahead.
