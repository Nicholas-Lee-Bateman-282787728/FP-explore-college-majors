Mendez,"[0, 0]","Even a bad Jackie Chan movie turns out to be better than most of the action/comedies available, but City Hunter is an exception.The action is hard to follow, and the humor too childish.  By example, while fighting at the game room, he turns into characthers of the &quot;Street fighter&quot; video game, turning even into Chun Li (with make up, dress and everything) and making some of the moves as in the videogame.It is uncomfortable to enjoy the movie when it turns so stupid.  There is a good scene in which Chan, fighting inside a movie theatre, imitates the movements of Bruce Lee on the screen.  But thhat scene alone is not worth the experience of &quot;City Hunter&quot;",2,Too absurd even by the Chan standard,973209600,"11 3, 2000",2000,679,"['Even', 'bad', 'Jackie', 'Chan', 'movie', 'out', 'be', 'better', 'most', 'action/comedies', 'available', 'City', 'Hunter', 'exception.The', 'action', 'hard', 'follow', 'humor', 'too', 'childish', 'example', 'fighting', 'game', 'room', 'characthers', 'quot', 'Street', 'fighter', 'quot', 'video', 'game', 'turning', 'even', 'Chun', 'Li', 'make', 'up', 'dress', 'everything', 'making', 'moves', 'videogame.It', 'uncomfortable', 'enjoy', 'movie', 'when', 'so', 'stupid', 'good', 'scene', 'Chan', 'fighting', 'movie', 'theatre', 'movements', 'Bruce', 'Lee', 'screen', 'scene', 'alone', 'not', 'worth', 'experience', 'quot', 'City', 'Hunter', 'quot']",N/A
503874,A2DK2OY6R3WICK,B00000IMBH,C.W. Fitch,"[3, 4]","For years, Jackie Chan has been the master of martial arts mayhem.  Quite a few of his films have blended intense fight scenes with hilarious physical comedy.  I think &quot;City Hunter&quot; is one of the best examples of this.  From the opening bell, this flick is pure kung-fu camp.  Even though the plot seems serious enough, the seriousness is dashed on the rocks by Jackie's (and the supporting cast's) on-screen antics filling every scene.  The physical humor is absolutely side-splitting, and the best part is, Jackie's not the only one pulling it off!  Nearly the entire cast contributes a moment or two of tomfoolery.  The movie did an outstanding job of capturing that anime feel.  It's like watching a live-action comic book!  Australian martial-arts star Richard Norton makes a great lead villian (he's even better in &quot;Mr. Nice Guy&quot;), and Gary Daniels is awesome as his head flunkie.  The exchanges between him and Jackie make for the best fight scenes in the film, although the last battle between Jackie and Norton is a smash as well.  The fight between Jackie and Daniels in the ship's arcade is by far one of the most bizarre spectacles in the history of chop-socky; you've just gotta see it to believe it.  Although it's not the best-known, it's definitely one of Jackie's best flicks; every aspect of it makes it a must-buy for fans of this genre.",5,&quot;Listen up.

If you're looking for a humerous movie that you can just watch and laugh, then City Hunter is the movie for you.My favorite part in the entire movie is where Jackie Chan is electricuted and imagines himself in a video game where  he can change characters and has special powers to fight of the main villian.I was a little lost however on some of the roles of  various characters in the film as I have never read, nor seen the original Japanese cartoon strip from whence this movie was pulled from. But the confusion doesn't really get in the way of watching and enjoying this movie.Just one more little thing; its probally best to watch this movie in its original language as the English track doesn't have Jackie's voice over, unlike in some of his other dubbed films.

I later rented it from a Blockbuster and it was dubbed and many of my favorite scenes were cut out.  Don't rent from that place if you can help it!Anyway, this movie is about Ryu Saeba, a private detective of considerable ability.  Well, he is cool anyway.  OK, he likes women and is otherwise not too competant, but he is a good fighter and acrobat.  He ends up getting a case to find a rich man's daughter and follows her onto a cruise ship that just happens to be a terrorist target!  Hilarity and action ensues as Ryu fights the bad guys.I really enjoyed the &quot;Gala Gala Happy&quot; rap video in the middle of the movie (this is one that was missing from the Blockbuster version).

503878,A38UHOCEKSUOSP,B00000IMBH,"dominion_ruler ""Bryan""","[4, 4]","This really isn't that bad of a movie for what it is.  City Hunter is based off of the Japanese cartoon City Hunter, and although this is not an animated film, it is presented as such with loads of cheesy dialouge, goofy characters, cheesy music, and cartoony sound effects.  If that wasn't enough, the English dubbing version makes it just about as silly as it can get.  Chan's voice unfortunately is not dubbed by himself in the English version, although his English voice-over is present in many of his H.K. films.  The biggest reason anyone may want to own this film is that is also features charcaters played by Richard Norton (Road House 2, Mr. Nice Guy, Rage and Honor) and Gary Daniels (White Tiger, Rage, Riot) - the two bad guys.At some point you may end up turning this movie off before the end arrives, if you are not into such a goofy film.  However, the ending is rewarding with a strong 5 minute fight with Jackie Chan against Richard Norton.  Easily the best entertaining fight in the film, the Richard Norton character beats up Chan repeatedly with 2 short poles that can change into numchucks.  Jackie does some cool small stunts using chairs and tables in the scene.  There is also 2 fights with Jackie against the Gary Daniels charcater.  The first fight is pretty short in a cabin on the cruise ship. The 2nd fight is just the silliest darned thing I have ever seen.  Street Fighter video game fans might enjoy it.  Jackie is thrown into an arcade machine, electricuted, and begins to take the form of various Street Fighter 2 characters, while Gary Daniels is Ken.  The scene is no more than for laughs.  The fight is set to look like someone is button mashing the controls to the game.  When Chan becomes Chun Li, that was actually pretty funny.As for the story itself, its pretty simple.  A bunch of bad guys led by the Richard Norton character board a cruise ship and eventually expose their demands - robbing the crew.  Jackie Chan gets involved and tries to stop them.  The film is filled with action, but its mostly gun fire and chases, aside from the 2 forementioned fights.Although most Jackie Chan films are never very serious, this one is beyond silly.  Its set to be that way, so if you are ready to see a cartoony film created with real people, then you may want to check it out.  It tries to be funny throughout, but it pretty much failed for me.",3,will not be everyone's cup of tea (and it wasn't mine),1189814400,"09 15, 2007",2007,2381,"['really', ""n't"", 'bad', 'movie', 'what', 'City', 'Hunter', 'based', 'Japanese', 'cartoon', 'City', 'Hunter', 'not', 'animated', 'film', 'presented', 'such', 'loads', 'cheesy', 'dialouge', 'goofy', 'characters', 'cheesy', 'music', 'cartoony', 'sound', 'effects', 'was', ""n't"", 'enough', 'English', 'dubbing', 'version', 'just', 'as', 'silly', 'can', 'get', 'Chan', 'voice', 'unfortunately', 'not', 'dubbed', 'English', 'version', 'English', 'voice-over', 'present', 'many', 'H.K', 'films', 'biggest', 'reason', 'anyone', 'may', 'want', 'own', 'film', 'also', 'charcaters', 'played', 'Richard', 'Norton', 'Road', 'House', '2', 'Mr.', 'Nice', 'Guy', 'Rage', 'Honor', 'Gary', 'Daniels', 'White', 'Tiger', 'Rage', 'Riot', 'two', 'bad', 'guys.At', 'point', 'may', 'end', 'up', 'turning', 'movie', 'end', 'are', 'not', 'such', 'goofy', 'film', 'However', 'ending', 'rewarding', 'strong', '5', 'minute', 'fight', 'Jackie', 'Chan', 'Richard', 'Norton', 'Easily', 'best', 'entertaining', 'fight', 'film', 'Richard', 'Norton', 'character', 'up', 'Chan', 'repeatedly', '2', 'short', 'poles', 'can', 'change', 'numchucks', 'Jackie', 'cool', 'small', 'stunts', 'using', 'chairs', 'tables', 'scene', 'also', '2', 'fights', 'Jackie', 'Gary', 'Daniels', 'charcater', 'first', 'fight', 'pretty', 'short', 'cabin', 'cruise', 'ship', '2nd', 'fight', 'just', 'silliest', 'darned', 'thing', 'have', 'ever', 'seen', 'Street', 'Fighter', 'video', 'game', 'fans', 'might', 'enjoy', 'Jackie', 'thrown', 'arcade', 'machine', 'electricuted', 'take', 'form', 'various', 'Street', 'Fighter', '2', 'characters', 'Gary', 'Daniels', 'Ken', 'scene', 'more', 'laughs', 'fight', 'set', 'look', 'someone', 'button', 'mashing', 'controls', 'game', 'When', 'Chan', 'Chun', 'Li', 'was', 'actually', 'pretty', 'funny.As', 'story', 'pretty', 'simple', 'bunch', 'bad', 'guys', 'led', 'Richard', 'Norton', 'character', 'board', 'cruise', 'ship', 'eventually', 'expose', 'demands', 'robbing', 'crew', 'Jackie', 'Chan', 'involved', 'tries', 'stop', 'film', 'filled', 'action', 'mostly', 'gun', 'fire', 'chases', 'aside', '2', 'forementioned', 'most', 'Jackie', 'Chan', 'films', 'are', 'never', 'very', 'serious', 'one', 'silly', 'set', 'be', 'way', 'so', 'are', 'ready', 'see', 'cartoony', 'film', 'created', 'real', 'people', 'then', 'may', 'want', 'check', 'out', 'be', 'funny', 'pretty', 'much', 'failed']",N/A

There are a few scenes which are very memorable, ie- Bruce Lee Move theatre, Streetfighter, and a pretty cool end fight scene. This is one silly film, maybe even a bit stupid and weird at times. My two friends hated this movie alot, but I enjoyed it quite a bit. Jackie Chan has done better, no doubt, and this is not for first timers. Its an attempt at creating the world of Anime in a non-animation setting. I appreciate what its trying to do, and it had alot of funny gags that you would find normally in an anime. (FOr example guy characters always are hungry and girl chasing)The fight scenes are goofy, but as always jackie makes them interesting, especially the end fight. This is not for everyone, but its cool to see an Anime come to life like this.HardCore Jackie Chan fans need only apply.",2,2 1/2  For Jackie Fans who want sumthin a bit different.,985392000,"03 24, 2001",2001,917,"['reason', 'rating', 'casual', 'moviegoer', 'would', 'not', 'enjoy', 'film', 'would', 'Kung', 'Fu', 'movie', 'fans', 'are', 'few', 'scenes', 'are', 'very', 'memorable', 'ie-', 'Bruce', 'Lee', 'Move', 'theatre', 'Streetfighter', 'pretty', 'cool', 'end', 'fight', 'scene', 'one', 'silly', 'film', 'maybe', 'even', 'bit', 'stupid', 'weird', 'times', 'two', 'friends', 'hated', 'movie', 'alot', 'enjoyed', 'quite', 'bit', 'Jackie', 'Chan', 'done', 'better', 'doubt', 'not', 'first', 'timers', 'attempt', 'creating', 'world', 'Anime', 'non-animation', 'setting', 'appreciate', 'what', 'trying', 'do', 'had', 'alot', 'funny', 'gags', 'would', 'find', 'normally', 'anime', 'FOr', 'example', 'guy', 'characters', 'always', 'are', 'hungry', 'girl', 'chasing', 'fight', 'scenes', 'are', 'goofy', 'always', 'jackie', 'interesting', 'especially', 'end', 'fight', 'not', 'everyone', 'cool', 'see', 'Anime', 'come', 'life', 'this.HardCore', 'Jackie', 'Chan', 'fans', 'need', 'only', 'apply']",N/A
