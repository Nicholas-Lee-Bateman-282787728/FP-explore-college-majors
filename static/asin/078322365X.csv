These are rhetorical questions so don't trouble your frontal lobe. I'm sick of  hearing films being trashed simply because they happen to star an actor  more known for muscle mass than theatrical prowess. If the later was the  only measure of quality, Laurence Olivier's movies would have all been  financial blockbusters.And who could better epitomize action  heroes than the man dubbed  &quot;The Muscles from Brussels&quot;? Yes, I'm  referring to Jean-Claude Van Damme. He manages to get the lion's share of  the screen in &quot;Timecop&quot;. In some cases we're doubly Dammed when  he goes back in time and meets himself. After all, this is a science  fiction film. Time travel is the central plot device and it is used very  well throughout the story.I suppose the SCI-FI die-hards among us  will cringe at yet another use of that hoary old question, &quot;What would  happen if you went back in time and killed your grandfather?&quot; Luckily  the screenwriters were a little more grounded in reality. Why trouble our  grandparents when we could make a quick buck. Isn't that the first thing  most folks would turn their time traveling adventure into; a chance to  score some serious coin?Which is were the main villain comes in.  Senator Aaron McComb wants to be the president but his less than charming  personality would, under normal circumstances, preclude any chance of  election. But all he really needs is enormous piles of cash in order to buy  sufficient air-time to sway the mindless masses. Luckily, he is on the  oversight committee that monitors the Temporal  Enforcement Agency, or  Timecops as they are known to themselves.The evil Senator's plans  for world domination seem to be going very smoothly until headstrong Max  Walker, (Van Damme), brings one of the politician's henchmen to justice.  From that point on, good and evil fight a running skirmish through time.  The trick is to change the past in such a way as to prevent a  counter-strike by the other side. And it is this convoluted logic which  makes the film so engrossing.The effects and set designs are very  good but with enough scientific flubs to keep the purist grinding his  teeth. Personally, I had a ball. This movie doesn't have the tension of a  Terminator flick, or the depth of a Kubrik brain fest. What is does have is  action, high kicking action that only pauses long enough to squeeze in a  little lost love pathos. So if you like your SCI-FI hard and fast, give  Jean-Claude another chance and watch Timecop.",4,Time enough for love,958003200,"05 11, 2000",2000,2644,"['Once', 'again', 'find', 'swimming', 'tide', 'critical', 'opinion', 'Can', 'help', 'like', 'action', 'films', 'Should', 'be', 'ashamed', 'are', 'rhetorical', 'questions', 'so', 'do', ""n't"", 'trouble', 'frontal', 'lobe', ""'m"", 'sick', 'hearing', 'films', 'being', 'trashed', 'simply', 'happen', 'star', 'actor', 'more', 'known', 'muscle', 'mass', 'theatrical', 'prowess', 'later', 'was', 'only', 'measure', 'quality', 'Laurence', 'Olivier', 'movies', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'financial', 'blockbusters.And', 'who', 'could', 'better', 'epitomize', 'action', 'heroes', 'man', 'dubbed', 'quot', 'Muscles', 'Brussels', 'quot', 'Yes', ""'m"", 'referring', 'Jean-Claude', 'Van', 'Damme', 'get', 'lion', 'share', 'screen', 'quot', 'Timecop', 'quot', 'cases', ""'re"", 'doubly', 'Dammed', 'when', 'back', 'time', 'meets', 'science', 'fiction', 'film', 'Time', 'travel', 'central', 'plot', 'device', 'used', 'very', 'well', 'story.I', 'suppose', 'SCI-FI', 'die-hards', 'will', 'cringe', 'yet', 'use', 'hoary', 'old', 'question', 'quot', 'What', 'would', 'happen', 'went', 'back', 'time', 'killed', 'grandfather', 'quot', 'Luckily', 'screenwriters', 'were', 'little', 'more', 'grounded', 'reality', 'Why', 'trouble', 'grandparents', 'when', 'could', 'make', 'quick', 'buck', ""n't"", 'first', 'thing', 'most', 'folks', 'would', 'turn', 'time', 'traveling', 'adventure', 'chance', 'score', 'serious', 'coin', 'Which', 'were', 'main', 'villain', 'Senator', 'Aaron', 'McComb', 'be', 'president', 'less', 'charming', 'personality', 'would', 'normal', 'circumstances', 'preclude', 'chance', 'election', 'really', 'enormous', 'piles', 'cash', 'order', 'buy', 'sufficient', 'air-time', 'sway', 'mindless', 'masses', 'Luckily', 'oversight', 'committee', 'Temporal', 'Enforcement', 'Agency', 'Timecops', 'are', 'known', 'themselves.The', 'evil', 'Senator', 'plans', 'world', 'domination', 'seem', 'be', 'going', 'very', 'smoothly', 'headstrong', 'Max', 'Walker', 'Van', 'Damme', 'one', 'politician', 'henchmen', 'justice', 'point', 'good', 'evil', 'fight', 'running', 'skirmish', 'time', 'trick', 'change', 'past', 'such', 'way', 'prevent', 'counter-strike', 'other', 'side', 'convoluted', 'logic', 'film', 'so', 'engrossing.The', 'effects', 'set', 'designs', 'are', 'very', 'good', 'enough', 'scientific', 'flubs', 'keep', 'purist', 'grinding', 'teeth', 'Personally', 'had', 'ball', 'movie', ""n't"", 'have', 'tension', 'Terminator', 'flick', 'depth', 'Kubrik', 'brain', 'fest', 'What', 'have', 'action', 'high', 'kicking', 'action', 'only', 'pauses', 'long', 'enough', 'squeeze', 'little', 'lost', 'love', 'pathos', 'So', 'SCI-FI', 'hard', 'fast', 'give', 'Jean-Claude', 'chance', 'watch', 'Timecop']",N/A
51320,A3MQAQT8C6D1I7,078322365X,AverageReviewer,"[0, 0]","I've always been a mixed fan of Jean Claude - I like some of the movies he stars in and then there are others that are I could take or leave.Timecop is one of those that is good even for a movie that is more than a decade old.Basically, Jean Claude plays a time enforcement cop who works for an agency that polices the timeline for people who try to go back in time and make things better for themselves.  I won't spoil the movie, but just know that things wind up getting personal and he winds up having to go back in time and at one point ""goes rogue"" as he works to apprehend the bad guys.Overall, the acting was good, the directing was excellent, the special effects were good for the time.  Time travel movies are hard to do because you risk confusing the audience at large, you risk exposing plot flaults when things don't add up, and you risk the critique from the people who analyze the consequences of changing timelines etc.  As a time travel movie, this is pretty tightly put together and the direction is very good which makes things hold together fairly well.The movie has a fair degree of review value (you can see it several times as background) associated with it.This movie comes from when Van Damme was peaking in his career and surrounding himself with excellent directing and production teams and undertaking good projects.  I'm also a great fan of Bruce McGill's acting so his presence in the movie elevates it somewhat for me.  Additionally Ron Silver plays a great bad guy.  Mia Sara is stunningly beautiful and a wonderful actress as usual and Gloria Reuben plays a great sidekick to VanDamme.  Overall, very solid actors with great fighting scenes from Van Damme.If you like cop shows and can tolerate a bit of sci fi/time travel, you should enjoy this film.",5,A Good Time Travel Cop Show,1232409600,"01 20, 2009",2009,1783,"[""'ve"", 'always', 'been', 'mixed', 'fan', 'Jean', 'Claude', 'like', 'movies', 'then', 'are', 'others', 'are', 'could', 'take', 'leave.Timecop', 'one', 'good', 'even', 'movie', 'more', 'decade', 'old.Basically', 'Jean', 'Claude', 'time', 'enforcement', 'cop', 'who', 'agency', 'timeline', 'people', 'who', 'try', 'go', 'back', 'time', 'make', 'things', 'better', 'wo', ""n't"", 'spoil', 'movie', 'just', 'know', 'things', 'wind', 'up', 'getting', 'personal', 'up', 'having', 'go', 'back', 'time', 'one', 'point', 'rogue', 'apprehend', 'bad', 'guys.Overall', 'acting', 'was', 'good', 'directing', 'was', 'excellent', 'special', 'effects', 'were', 'good', 'time', 'Time', 'travel', 'movies', 'are', 'hard', 'do', 'risk', 'confusing', 'audience', 'large', 'risk', 'exposing', 'plot', 'flaults', 'when', 'things', 'do', ""n't"", 'add', 'up', 'risk', 'critique', 'people', 'who', 'analyze', 'consequences', 'changing', 'timelines', 'etc', 'time', 'travel', 'movie', 'pretty', 'tightly', 'put', 'together', 'direction', 'very', 'good', 'things', 'hold', 'together', 'fairly', 'well.The', 'movie', 'fair', 'degree', 'review', 'value', 'can', 'see', 'several', 'times', 'background', 'associated', 'it.This', 'movie', 'when', 'Van', 'Damme', 'was', 'peaking', 'career', 'surrounding', 'excellent', 'directing', 'production', 'teams', 'undertaking', 'good', 'projects', ""'m"", 'also', 'great', 'fan', 'Bruce', 'McGill', 'acting', 'so', 'presence', 'movie', 'somewhat', 'Additionally', 'Ron', 'Silver', 'great', 'bad', 'guy', 'Mia', 'Sara', 'stunningly', 'beautiful', 'wonderful', 'actress', 'usual', 'Gloria', 'Reuben', 'great', 'sidekick', 'VanDamme', 'Overall', 'very', 'solid', 'actors', 'great', 'fighting', 'scenes', 'Van', 'Damme.If', 'cop', 'shows', 'can', 'tolerate', 'bit', 'sci', 'fi/time', 'travel', 'should', 'enjoy', 'film']",N/A

No politician, no matter what party or where, would be this much of low-life. In fact, the story is full of unlikable and untrustworthy characters, too many of them.

And if that means sitting thru a Jean-Claude Van Damme picture, so be it. Good thing then that TIMECOP happens to be one of the best films the Muscles from Brussels had ever helicopter kicked his way in. And, plus, there's time travel, possibly my favorite sci-fi plot device. I love me some time travel.Van Damme plays a character with the very Belgian-sounding name of Max Walker. In the year 2004 Walker is an operative for the Time Enforcement Commission (TEC). On the crime-stopping angle, Walker finds himself trying to stymie the horrific ambitions of corrupt senator Aaron McComb (Ron Silver). But the emotional heft relies on Walker's palpable loneliness and lingering hurt from losing his wife ten years ago, when she was murdered. Would you be surprised to learn that a chance surfaces in which Walker can alter the past and save his wife? The moral quandary for Walker is that tampering with time travel is the very thing he's tasked to prevent.Who knew Van Damme could do ""world-weary"" so well? Or maybe the then fabricated grey in his temple makes him more convincing. This was when Van Damme was in his physical prime and so the action scenes are very decent. Van Damme's heyday was in the early '90s when he churned out films that were van damn entertaining (DEATH WARRANT, UNIVERSAL SOLDIER, HARD TARGET, NOWHERE TO RUN). TIMECOP, having come out in 1994, was the last good one before his career started crappping out and he was forced to start exploring the wonderful world of made-for-cable cinema. TIMECOP is a solid sci-fi thriller. It's even got a touching love story.""Changing the past will have dire consequences."" ""The same matter can't occupy space at the same time."" You hear stuff like that and you know that time travel is in the house. I hesitate to go into it more because that would spoilerize things, but the film comes up with some pretty neat perspective shifts tied into the time travel element. One rather nifty instance of temporal cause and effect is when Walker travels to the past and bloodies Senator McComb in the face, only to have a corresponding scar suddenly appearing on the face of the present-day McComb (who had also traveled to the past to see his younger self).Not that I'm some cruel critical fashionista, but nowadays I try not to judge too harshly those awful futuristic outfits as designed in the 1990s, and I never did think too fondly of Van Damme's sleeves brushed all the way up the wrists look. Van Damme, as I've said, turns in a strong dramatic performance even if he doesn't quite share Schwarzenegger's panache with the one-liners. In fact there's one scene in which Gloria Reuben's character accuses Van Damme: ""You're not funny."" To which, Van Damme replies: ""I'm never funny."" Truer words, Jean-Claude, truer words... Still, the Muscles from Brussels has got that helicopter kick thing going on, and that crazy forehead knot. Now even Schwarzenegger has those claims to fame. TIME COP isn't near to being the best time travel yarn to ever be spun, but it's an entertaining, watchable effort. We get to see what Gainesville, Georgia was like for a moment back in 1893, and Wall Street in the throes of the Great Depression in 1929. And TIMECOP has the answer if you're curious about what the year 2004 has in store for us.

No, and then yes, and then no again, and eventually yes.  Awesome.When a movie starts during the Civil War with a hillbilly sporting eight teeth, two laser-sighted machine guns, and a singular intention of robbing the Confederacy of gold bars, there is no doubt that it's about to be awesome.  JCVD has never looked cooler.  He's rocking a massive coif of 80s hair on the verge of a permullet, and he struts/walks in every scene like it looks good.  With a supporting cast of Ron Silver and Bruce McGill, Timecop registers as one of the better acted JCVD movies.  In addition, the script and pacing are better than the majority of most action blockbusters - there is real creativity in the story composition.  Exploring the spectacular concepts ofBack to the Futureand amplifying them, Timecop is superb on all levels.  Narrowly missing out on being the top JCVD movie of all time, any action or sci-fi fan should thoroughly enjoy this JCVD thriller.",5,Back to the Future on steroids!,1231632000,"01 11, 2009",2009,2516,"['Jean', 'Claude', 'Van', 'Damme', 'Review', 'Matrix', 'JCVD-RM', '1', 'Who', 'Max', 'Walker', 'law', 'enforcement', 'officer', 'government', 'organization', 'monitors', 'time', 'travel', 'past', 'who', 'would', 'take', 'advantage', 'technology', 'Biff', 'Skynet.2', 'Which', 'family', 'member/friend', 'must', 'be', 'avenged', 'Unfortunately', 'JCVD', '80s', 'movie', 'fans', 'everywhere', 'must', 'avenge', 'lovely', 'wife', 'who', 'nothing', 'unblowupable.3', 'take', 'shirt', 'off', 'Only', 'once', 'shredded.4', 'have', 'sex', 'C-List', 'actress', 'pinnacle', 'JCVD', 'legendary', 'black', 'book', 'Mia', 'Sara', 'same', 'gorgeous', 'young', 'lady', 'who', 'played', 'Sloane', 'Peterson', 'Ferris', 'Bueller', 'Day', 'Off.5', 'tournament', 'tournament', 'just', 'race', 'fight', 'crime.6', 'training', 'needed', 'tournament', 'One', 'not', 'simply', 'travel', 'past', 'training', 'Delorean.7', 'do', 'splits', 'training', 'tournament', 'CONSTANTLY', 'splits', 'kitchen', 'living', 'room.8', 'punch', 'someone', 'balls', 'First', 'JCVD', 'beatdown', 'movie', '=', 'stick', 'junk9', 'do', 'series', 'flying', '360', 'kicks', 'Oh', 'hell', 'yes', 'classic', 'Van', 'Damme.10', 'enemy', 'unbeatable', 'fighting', 'time', 'travel', 'government', 'corruption', 'futuristic', 'weapons', 'about', 'as', 'close', 'get', 'unbeatable.11', 'overcome', 'injury', 'other', 'hindrance', ""'ve"", 'never', 'been', 'shot', 'wearing', 'bullet', 'proof', 'vest', 'would', 'hurt', 'hell', 'JCVD', 'shook', 'off', 'champ.12', 'win', 'No', 'then', 'yes', 'then', 'again', 'eventually', 'yes', 'Awesome.When', 'movie', 'Civil', 'War', 'hillbilly', 'sporting', 'eight', 'teeth', 'two', 'laser-sighted', 'machine', 'guns', 'singular', 'intention', 'robbing', 'Confederacy', 'gold', 'bars', 'doubt', 'be', 'awesome', 'JCVD', 'never', 'looked', 'cooler', 'rocking', 'massive', 'coif', '80s', 'hair', 'verge', 'permullet', 'scene', 'good', 'supporting', 'cast', 'Ron', 'Silver', 'Bruce', 'McGill', 'Timecop', 'one', 'better', 'acted', 'JCVD', 'movies', 'addition', 'script', 'pacing', 'are', 'better', 'majority', 'most', 'action', 'blockbusters', 'real', 'creativity', 'story', 'composition', 'Exploring', 'spectacular', 'concepts', 'ofBack', 'Futureand', 'amplifying', 'Timecop', 'superb', 'levels', 'Narrowly', 'missing', 'out', 'being', 'top', 'JCVD', 'movie', 'time', 'action', 'sci-fi', 'fan', 'should', 'thoroughly', 'enjoy', 'JCVD', 'thriller']",N/A

There have been time-travel _movies_, but they're generally not action flicks. (_Somewhere in Time_, for example, is primarily a romance, and the brilliant _12 Monkeys_ isn't about ""action."") Of course there's Nicholas Meyer's excellent _Time After Time_, which isn't as well known as it should be.And there's this one. It's not (just) a Van Damme vehicle, though it works well enough for fans of the Muscles from Brussels. It's also a fairly well constructed and enjoyable SF movie.SF readers be warned: it does _not_ have the logical tightness of Robert A. Heinlein's early time-travel stories ('By His Bootstraps', 'All You Zombies'), or even of the first _Terminator_ film. But as Heinlein found in later life, an unalterable past/future just doesn't make for very exciting drama. (As of _The Cat Who Walks Through Walls_, RAH was officially allowing the past, and therefore the future, to be changed.)For this film, director Peter Hyams and screenwriters Mark Verheiden and Mark Richardson (also the writers of the Dark Horse comic on which the film is based) borrow liberally but loosely from Poul Anderson's Time Patrol stories. Since (according to this scheme) a physically feasible means of time travel not only exists but can be used to change the past, there will be all sorts of baddies around who will try to adjust things to their own advantage. So there will have to be some time-travel cops who intervene to preserve the 'real' timestream.Van Damme is one such cop. And in this film he's pitted against Ron Silver, well cast as a crooked politician who wants to rearrange things so that he becomes dictator of America.Even if you buy the theory of time travel involved here, you've still got some camels to swallow. What, for example, is this nonsense about people exploding if they come into physical contact with their earlier or later selves? The physical explanation given for it in the film is just silly, not only according to 'real' physics but even on the film's own internal logic.But if you can manage to rationalize this stuff (or at least suspend incredulity long enough to watch the thing), you'll find a well crafted SF drama that succeeds extremely well in its strictly dramatic aspects. And you don't have to be a Van Damme fan to enjoy it. (People who criticize Van Damme's acting may not have seen this movie or some of his more recent work. He's not Olivier or anything, but for this sort of movie, he's _way_ better than his detractors like to admit.)I'm deducting a star for the full-screen format of the DVD release.

It was the last theatrical hit for Jean Claude Van Damme He didn't have a huge hit in theaters after this. Directed by Peter Hymes he directed 2010, Sudden Death End Of Days. Stars Jean Claude Van Damme as Max Walker Ron Silver as Senator Aaron McComb & Mia Sara as Melissa Walker. Start off this guy went back to 1863 guns down a bunch of confederate soldiers & he took there gold so then it goes to this White House meetingwhere there going to create The TEC The Time Enforcement Comission Senator Aaron McComb wants to be the head of it. We then meet Melissa Walker & her Husband Max Walker Max is a Washington DC Cop who is going to join the TEC. We also get to see Mia Sara nude & unfortunately Van Damme. A cop calls in sick & Max has to go to work but he's attacked & is beaten up his house blows up while Melissa is in there. It's 10 years later & Max has longer hair which the mullet is better here than Hard Target. Max goes to 1929 there's this guy investing in stocks & has a paper seeing how well there doing in 2004 it happens to be Max Walker's partner & Max has to take him back cause he's breaking the law this is what makes this movie work people would try to change the past. The guy calls in his goons 1 of them say ""I went with John L Sullivan."" Max says ""I saw Tyson beat Spinks on TV."" So Walker beats them up the guy jumps out the window & Max gets to him in time he is sentenced to death immediately Max tries to make him tell that Aaron McComb was behimd this sceme to become President but he won't say cause McComb will have his entire bloodline wiped out. So he goes right back to continue his fall & a cop says ""Poor b@st*rd tomorrow might have been a brighter day."" McComb wants to shut TEC down & the scenes Van Damme & Ron Silver have together are rememberable. McComb sends some henchies after Max we get a cool knife fight. Walker is given a partner officer Felding he doesn't want a partner but they go to 1994 they go to this warehouse where the younger Aaron McComb is making a business deal & the older McComb shows up tells him to invest it in the future campaign. This scene has some good action you get some decent gore. Fielding turns out to be an inside girl she tells him she early voted. So ahead of it's time. McComb shoots Fielding & betrays her. Max also finds out about what Melissa wanted to tell him that she was pregnant. He goes to find Melissa McComb plans on having them killed. It leads to a great scene pretty climatic the roof top scene was great. Peter Hymes did a great job he made the movie look big budget. 2 things his son didn't learn directing & good character development. Jean Claude Van Damme was great. Mia Sara wasn't in it a whole lot but she was good for what she was given. Ron Silver was great believeable shame he's gone. The Blu Ray transfer is awesome.

51356,ASV52HLP0HKP8,078322365X,JSAENZ,"[0, 0]","I am a super fan of science fiction.  I started reading about this topic when I was 15 (1974) and I found in the garbage recipient of my father room a novel.  Even now I don't know why I took this novel since I am very lazy to read and also the novel was very thick.  Strange, I started to read the novel and I was capture forever in the initial 3 pages.  I went to the bookstore to look for more novels and the precious as gollum says in Lord of the Rings, &#34;The Foundation&#34; came into my hand.  The masters of masters of science fiction (my humble opinion) ISAAC ASIMOV.  Foundation Trilogy or The Trantor Cycle. Magnifique. This is science fictions 101, a must for any beginner.As I am an electronic engineer, of course I love mathematics and physics.  Although I never went into a master degree in electronics.  One of my dreams, followed by a PHD.I have thought deeply about a paradox in science fiction.  Many TV series and movies explain the paradox in time and it is very hard evn think about it, a headache!. An effect occurs first followed by the cause.  How can this happen? Normally you have cause and effect, as Merovingian in Matrix Reload explained very very very well indeed.  Maybe the paradox happens because we think that time is a line and it could be certain but some time (diverging)  the line path is converted in a curve and it goes back and intercept the time line before it so the future and the past coincide.  Then I believe it is possible that the effect occurs before the cause.In this movie, a time travel comes possible to the past only.  So in order to avoid the change of the future by people traveling to the past, they set up a police time travel force.  In this paradox, the family is killed before Van Damme becomes a time travel police.In Star Trek Voyager, there are very interesting chapters of paradoxes.  They arrived to a solar system and detected a planet where an explosion have occurred and destroyed the whole planet and all life in it.  Then, they went to investigate what happened and they entered in a time subspace fissure and traveled to the past, when the explosion had not happened yet.  Then they discovered that they were responsible for the explosion in the future.  At the last moment, they avoided the mistake that generated the explosion and the time line is modified and the explosion never occurred and nobody remembered anything because it never happened (only the telepathy woman in the crew could sense something).  Beautiful example of the paradox.In Star Trek New Generation, they explained that every moment in the present have infinte future paths.  And all the paths exists.  So I am really in one of the infinite paths. So it make me happen that are infinite me, me, me as Agent Smith says in Matrix Reload.  Interesting fiction theory.

That is pretty insulting really when you think a long time, say 5 seconds, about it.As an action movie, Van damme has the moves here. The film moves along at a reasonable pace and the story is plausible if you do not think about it too much. Tragically there is the repetitive theme common to most of the star's movies of the family man who cares. This tends to be the major flaw in his work.One of the things that really gets me irritated is the tendency to postulate futures where the differences betwenn the near future and now are presented in such a stark fashion that they are incredible to contemplate. here particularly I refer to the vehicles and to some of the coostumes. Look back over the last fifty years and you will see gradual change but essentially the basic styles have remained the same. I understand that for dramatic effect these are useful devices but then they are undermined by the sloppy tendency to use music from olde eras which clearly has not changed.The holes in the plot are there for all to see although they are disguised by the clever circularity which the film makers use. The action sequences are impressive although they look very dated today, certainly in comparison with Jet Li for instance. Then there is the scene for the ladies where Jean-Claude does the splits.

But bad guys from the future soon learn about it and go back in time to kill him and ruin his life by having his wife murdered after causing his house to explode. 10 years later, Agent Max Walker has been carrying out missions for the force and made a good time-traveler. But he wishes he could go back and prevent the terrible tragedy from happening to his wife. But it is a rule for people to change their own lives and alter the course of history. An evil senator running for president in 2004 is causing schemes by having his henchman go back in time and embezzle money so he can have his polls go up real easily. Max Walker learns about this when the presidential candidate has changed history by having the force shut down and is winning in the election. Walker knows he has to travel back to stop this and sees it as his chance to get his wife back so he can have the happy life he was supposed to have.

Ten years later, in 2004, the cop is now a jaded officer with the Time Police.  Time Travel has been discovered, and some individuals are going back to try to make a killing in the stock market, or to just steal valuables.  The Time Police are a secret government organization, as the news that time travel is now a reality has not been leaked to the public.TimeCop has great action scenes with Van Damme, great special effects, great sets, costumes, and acting.  So why only three stars?  The movie opens during the Civil War, with a great scene.  Shortly after, there is a scene of Wall Street in 1929.  These sets and costumes are great, but the viewer is let down because there are no more trips to the past before 1994.  There are lots of scenes set in 2004.  These scenes are interesting, because it is now 2004, but we do not have all the futuristic cars, homes, and computers that the filmakers imagined.

But ""Timecop"" is the exception to the rule.This is a quite clever story about a very special police force, which fights against the abuse of time travelling. Timecops search fugitives who escaped in the past (there is no travels into the future), bandits, who go to the past to loot and plunder using modern weaponry, crooks, who try to make fortune using knowledge of future events, finally terrorists, who try to influence the future by changing the past. The whole concept is vaguely inspired by SF novel by Paul Anderson, ""Time Patrol"". JC Van Damme plays one of the Timecops, Mia Sara (delicious and distinguished) is his wife and Gloria Reuben (highly attractive and well spoken) is his new partner. No more details about the story, but it is surprisingly clever, touching and contains surprising twists. There is only limited kicking and jumping from JC Van Damme, so if you are a martial arts fan, you will be probably unsatisfied - but if you enjoy good SF, you will be delighted. And the ending is really, really unexpected, and not stupid at all.Bottom line, this is a nice surprise from JC Van Damme, for whom it is the best role until now.

Its kind of a dumb goal, but Ron Silver(or Sliver or whatever his name is) plays the bad guy and portrays evil very well.There is no explanation for how the time travel technology was made possible; they don't show whether they use a flux-capacitor.  The timecop department sends people back by putting them in a vehicle that sits on a  rail, then accelerates to a high speed before sending the passengers back in time.  Van Damme is the best timecop because of his ass-kicking martial arts ability.Van Damme's plan is to go back in time, find the bad guy and stop him or kill him.  The movie never gives Van Damme any option other than killing the guy, he's not interested in bringing him back to the future.

51380,A2WCRX5OQM6FED,078322365X,"Mike Sehorn ""The Phantom Projectionist""","[1, 1]","""Timecop"" is and will probably remain Jean-Claude Van Damme's biggest starring vehicle. Subsequent pictures of his would have larger budgets, but this one will be hard to top when it comes to maximizing its resources. Director Peter Hyams (2010: The Year We Make Contact) remains one of the most respected filmmakers Van Damme has worked with. Dramatically, ""Timecop"" was largely the only film of Van Damme's that Hollywood critics didn't rip to shreds, at least untilJCVDrolled around. And while accounts of how much the movie made at the international box office vary, it's still unquestionably his most profitable film as of this writing. For this, I can respect the picture...but I'm not a huge fan of it. Van Damme definitely traded in some of his films' better qualities when he went from cult hero to Hollywood superstar, and I miss them too much to rate this movie any higher.The story: Officer Max Walker (Van Damme) lives in a futuristic world where time travel and the misuse of which is possible. Tormented by the death of his wife of years past (Mia Sara,Legend) and the possibility of changing the past, he'll be the only one to stop a greedy politician (Ron Silver,Ali) from manipulating history to gain wealth and power.For starters, I could care less about any scientific follies the film might bear. That really doesn't interest me. What interests me is finally seeing Van Damme in a movie that can be deemed grade-A Hollywood material, with the huge sets and special effects thereof. Arguably,Hard Targethad already accomplished this a year prior, but ""Timecop"" outdoes it with big, Steven Spielberg-esque sets and a plot that's hands-down the most fantastic and ambitious Van Damme would ever undertake. For his part, he delivers a good dramatic performance: years before he received any award nominations for it, the Muscles' acting wasn't all that bad, and here, he's complemented by Ron Silver's performance as one of the more hissable jerk-villains from this era. With that said, I'm disappointed that the film didn't do more with its premise: it briefly visits mid-19th and early-20th America, but mostly takes place in 1994 and the not-too-different-from-the-present future. The straight-to-videoTimecop 2would rectify this by traveling all over history, but despite its scope, the original can't help but feel sort of contained.The film is far from being action-free, but - like Steven Seagal'sUnder Siege- ""Timecop"" is benchmark in Van Damme's career when he was moving away from the gritty, personal martial arts of his early flicks and embracing gunfights, explosions, and the like, which I don't think are nearly as fun as seeing him kick somebody. There's enough brawling throughout the movie to keep casual fans satisfied - including a showdown with Richard Faraci (Rumble in the Bronx) and a surprisingly brutalMortal Kombat-style limb-freeze and shattering - but the only genuine back & forth battle he has is a short-ish knife fight with stunt icon James Lew (Balance of Power). The script suffers particularly during these action scenes: I don't care that the narrative grinds to a halt while Van Damme fires a gun or throws a few punches, but the one-liners he's fed to try and make him seem like a miniature Arnold Schwarzenegger are particularly uninspired. Come on, guys - ""have a nice day"" before Van Damme kicks a guy off a scaffolding? Try for at least a bit of wit, huh?Is it worth watching if you're a general action fan? Definitely. Is it worth buying? - probably, if you're a Van Damme nut. Is it the best Van Damme ever did? - definitely not. Basically, check it out, enjoy it if you can, but don't expect anything fantastic.",3,"""Never interrupt me when I'm talking to myself""",1331596800,"03 13, 2012",2012,3674,"['Timecop', 'will', 'probably', 'remain', 'Jean-Claude', 'Van', 'Damme', 'biggest', 'starring', 'vehicle', 'Subsequent', 'pictures', 'would', 'have', 'larger', 'budgets', 'one', 'will', 'be', 'hard', 'top', 'when', 'maximizing', 'resources', 'Director', 'Peter', 'Hyams', '2010', 'Year', 'Make', 'Contact', 'one', 'most', 'respected', 'filmmakers', 'Van', 'Damme', 'worked', 'Dramatically', 'Timecop', 'was', 'largely', 'only', 'film', 'Van', 'Damme', 'Hollywood', 'critics', 'did', ""n't"", 'rip', 'shreds', 'least', 'untilJCVDrolled', 'around', 'accounts', 'how', 'much', 'movie', 'made', 'international', 'box', 'office', 'vary', 'still', 'unquestionably', 'most', 'profitable', 'film', 'writing', 'can', 'respect', 'picture', ""'m"", 'not', 'huge', 'fan', 'Van', 'Damme', 'definitely', 'traded', 'films', 'better', 'qualities', 'when', 'went', 'cult', 'hero', 'Hollywood', 'superstar', 'miss', 'too', 'much', 'rate', 'movie', 'higher.The', 'story', 'Officer', 'Max', 'Walker', 'Van', 'Damme', 'futuristic', 'world', 'where', 'time', 'travel', 'misuse', 'possible', 'Tormented', 'death', 'wife', 'years', 'Mia', 'Sara', 'Legend', 'possibility', 'changing', 'past', ""'ll"", 'be', 'only', 'one', 'stop', 'greedy', 'politician', 'Ron', 'Silver', 'Ali', 'manipulating', 'history', 'gain', 'wealth', 'power.For', 'starters', 'could', 'care', 'less', 'scientific', 'film', 'might', 'bear', 'really', ""n't"", 'interest', 'What', 'interests', 'finally', 'seeing', 'Van', 'Damme', 'movie', 'can', 'be', 'deemed', 'grade-A', 'Hollywood', 'material', 'huge', 'sets', 'special', 'effects', 'thereof', 'Arguably', 'Hard', 'Targethad', 'already', 'accomplished', 'year', 'prior', 'Timecop', 'big', 'Steven', 'Spielberg-esque', 'sets', 'plot', 'hands-down', 'most', 'fantastic', 'ambitious', 'Van', 'Damme', 'would', 'ever', 'undertake', 'part', 'good', 'dramatic', 'performance', 'years', 'received', 'award', 'nominations', 'Muscles', 'acting', 'was', ""n't"", 'bad', 'here', 'complemented', 'Ron', 'Silver', 'performance', 'one', 'more', 'hissable', 'jerk-villains', 'era', 'said', ""'m"", 'disappointed', 'film', 'did', ""n't"", 'do', 'more', 'premise', 'visits', 'mid-19th', 'early-20th', 'America', 'mostly', 'place', '1994', 'not-too-different-from-the-present', 'future', 'straight-to-videoTimecop', '2would', 'rectify', 'traveling', 'history', 'scope', 'original', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'feel', 'sort', 'contained.The', 'film', 'far', 'being', 'action-free', 'Steven', ""Seagal'sUnder"", 'Siege-', 'Timecop', 'benchmark', 'Van', 'Damme', 'career', 'when', 'was', 'moving', 'away', 'gritty', 'personal', 'martial', 'arts', 'early', 'flicks', 'embracing', 'gunfights', 'explosions', 'like', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'are', 'nearly', 'as', 'fun', 'seeing', 'kick', 'somebody', 'enough', 'brawling', 'movie', 'keep', 'casual', 'fans', 'satisfied', 'including', 'showdown', 'Richard', 'Faraci', 'Rumble', 'Bronx', 'surprisingly', 'brutalMortal', 'Kombat-style', 'limb-freeze', 'shattering', 'only', 'genuine', 'back', 'forth', 'battle', 'short-ish', 'knife', 'fight', 'stunt', 'icon', 'James', 'Lew', 'Balance', 'Power', 'script', 'suffers', 'particularly', 'action', 'scenes', 'do', ""n't"", 'care', 'narrative', 'grinds', 'halt', 'Van', 'Damme', 'gun', 'few', 'punches', 'one-liners', 'fed', 'try', 'make', 'seem', 'miniature', 'Arnold', 'Schwarzenegger', 'are', 'particularly', 'uninspired', 'Come', 'guys', 'have', 'nice', 'day', 'Van', 'Damme', 'guy', 'off', 'scaffolding', 'Try', 'least', 'bit', 'wit', 'huh', 'worth', 'watching', ""'re"", 'general', 'action', 'fan', 'Definitely', 'worth', 'buying', 'probably', ""'re"", 'Van', 'Damme', 'nut', 'best', 'Van', 'Damme', 'ever', 'did', 'definitely', 'not', 'Basically', 'check', 'out', 'enjoy', 'can', 'do', ""n't"", 'expect', 'anything', 'fantastic']",N/A

Timeless late 80's early 90's films that were immensely popular at the time and quite enjoyable as action movies during that era.  However, Van Damme's reputation quickly faded because he was type-cast as the brute karate guy who was hell-bent on just kicking you in the face at an 120 degree angle.Timecop is Van Damme's glory film in his acting career.  A wonderful and entirely believable futuristic story of time travel that with a little better directing and production could have been a darn good action flick.  Van Damme plays a futuristic cop who witnesses his wife's murder and is determined to do something about it.  Coincidentally, he's the top time travel cop for the time travel program that the government currently has implemented for national security reasons.  Of course he's going to use that to his advantage.  What ensues is a mixture of other time travel movies all brought into one but with that Van Damme flair.  While the overlying message is that the past is a terrible thing to alter, Van Damme's life has never been the same since the loss of his wife.  The only way to survive his mundane existence and to save the country in the process is to go back in time, alter it, and kill a few bad guys in the process.  Van Damme is not over the top here, however.  He plays a darker character who displays believable emotion as a result of his surroundings.

Had it been made in the error of CGI, this film would have been so much better. The story is strong, a lot stronger than the performances, and the use of some crazy special effects would have taken it over the top, but those weren't available in 1994. The result is a slightly above average film, with a really cool plot, and not much else. The story follows Max Walker (Jean-Claude Van Damme) whose job is to stop people from using illegal time travel technology, in order to change the past. Changing the past can drastically change the present, and is often abused by criminals trying to get wealth and power. One of those men is U.S. Senator McComb (Ron Silver), who has his eye on the Presidency. Walker must go back in time to stop McComb and expose him, before he can reshape the country in his own image. I love time oriented Science Fiction, as the story can take you on a magical trip all throughout history, like nothing else can. In this film, they didn't travel as much as they should have, and the technology and effects behind time travel were so basic, that it's hard to buy that this could ever work. Jean-Claude Van Damme stars and we all know that I see him as one of these brawn over brains guys, that only get work because of their looks and their fancy movies. Van Damme wasn't bad, but this is a film that had real potential, and simply using an average star, contributes to the overall sentiment of the film. Timecop is a great story, and in my opinion is something that could really work if it is re-made properly. It's not because the film is bad, it's just not a good as it should have been.

Based on a comic book, the film combines that interesting premise, with special effects, and decent action sequences, producing an entertaining storyline that holds together pretty well, if you are not overly critical.In a career that has had its ups and downs, this is one of Jean-Claude Van Damme's highlights, starring as Max Walker an agent of the Time Enforcement Commission (TEC).  Jean-Claude is in top form physically, and there's plenty of action, and in close fighting featuring his trademark fancy footwork.  Ron Silver is Senator Aaron McComb, who is using time travel to raise funds for his presidential bid.  While that premise is a bit lame, the time travel aspect allows for some interesting and unexpected twists, turns, and returns.  Silver makes a pretty good villain, and Bruce McGill injects humor as Matuzak, the harried head of TEC.Walker's life is destroyed, when his wife Melissa, played by Mia Sara, is killed in an explosion.  Fortunately through the vehicle of time travel, Sara returns for more screen time, and some physically challenging action scenes.  Gloria Ruben (ER) plays Walker's new partner, who makes a bad decision, but again because of time travel, also gets a second chance at life.  The presence of both ladies, adds much to the enjoyment of the film.Big things don't make sense, like travelling back to the past in a winged vehicle, arriving there without it, and then somehow returning in the same vehicle.  The plot is cartoonish, but still fun.  The special effects while somewhat dated, still hold up rather well, and with your brain in neutral, Timecop can be a cool fantasy adventure.  Van Damme's acting is often maligned, but his performance here is quite good.  What is disappointing is that this release is fullscreen, with no substantial extras besides a trailer.

There are some folks who can't get past Van Damme the actor and just accept him a genuine physical presence on screen. He was never a star for his broken-English-seems-like-he's-reading-the-lines-off-of-his-palm line delivery.In Timecop Van Damme is Walker, a Time Enforcement Commission (""TEC"") Agent tasked with going back in time to catch time criminals, i.e., people who travel back in time to gain some illegal advantage from their knowledge of the future. In one of the early scenes we see Walker travel back to the thirties to stop a miscreant who is planning to buy up stock for rock bottom prices that will be worth millions in the future (the movie is set in 2004).Mia Sara is fine, if underused, as Van Damme's wife Melissa, but Ron Silver as the villanous Senator McComb really has fun with the scene chewing. The great character actor Bruce McGill makes the most out of his small part as Walker's boss, the commander of the ""TEC."" Add up their performances, some nice action sequences, a somewhat intelligent plot, and solid shooting by director Hyams, and you have a very satisfying popcorn flick for a rainy weekend afternoon.However, there is one problem with Timecop. The DVD is absolutely garbage! I don't think I've ever seen it for sale in widescreen format. The film has been made available on HD DVD, but a blu-ray seems to be nowhere in sight.
