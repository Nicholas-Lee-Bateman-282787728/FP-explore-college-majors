I liked the new story line they introduced in the last volume, and they continue to develop it in this volume . . . along with the hilarious characters.  Its seemed like some of the previous characters disappeared from this volume for long stretches or completely.

I started reading reviews and they were so consistently good I figured I should check it out. I'm glad I did. This is more fun than I've had in a while. Recreation is the most recent installment, and I know I should have started at the beginning, but I was still entertained beyond belief. Even without knowing the characters and missing various references to earlier episodes I found I was able to tune in right away to what was happening.I won't recount the plot because it's rather involved and would take too long. Also, I'm not sure it would matter. The key here is how these guys behave toward each other. They're totally hysterical. The writing is devilishly clever. It actually reminds me of South Park. What's happening is not as important as watching them react to what's happening.There is little movement here. Scenes consist mostly of them standing around in their high tech armor with their guns at ready and talking. The designs of things (the armor, vehicles, backgrounds, etc.) are good. And I understand they're better here than in earlier episodes so it's easy enough on the eyes. As I said, the animation itself isn't that good but it doesn't have to be. You just love what you hear.I may start putting these on my Christmas and birthday lists. Now that I have a taste I'll want to see where it started and how it progressed. I'm not a gamer so I'm probably at a disadvantage on some of what happens here, but what I did get was enough to tickle my funny bone. If clever, funny stuff is your poison, this should fill your cup.",5,What a Hoot,1282867200,"08 27, 2010",2010,1664,"['really', 'knew', 'was', 'was', 'game', 'based', 'older', 'son', 'kept', 'buying', 'installments', 'younger', 'son', 'started', 'reading', 'reviews', 'were', 'so', 'consistently', 'good', 'figured', 'should', 'check', 'out', ""'m"", 'glad', 'did', 'more', 'fun', ""'ve"", 'had', 'while', 'Recreation', 'most', 'recent', 'installment', 'know', 'should', 'have', 'started', 'beginning', 'was', 'still', 'entertained', 'belief', 'Even', 'knowing', 'characters', 'missing', 'various', 'references', 'earlier', 'episodes', 'found', 'was', 'able', 'tune', 'right', 'away', 'what', 'was', 'happening.I', 'wo', ""n't"", 'recount', 'plot', 'rather', 'involved', 'would', 'take', 'too', 'long', 'Also', ""'m"", 'not', 'sure', 'would', 'matter', 'key', 'here', 'how', 'guys', 'behave', 'other', ""'re"", 'totally', 'hysterical', 'writing', 'devilishly', 'clever', 'actually', 'South', 'Park', 'What', 'happening', 'not', 'as', 'important', 'watching', 'react', 'what', 'little', 'movement', 'here', 'Scenes', 'consist', 'mostly', 'standing', 'around', 'high', 'tech', 'armor', 'guns', 'ready', 'talking', 'designs', 'things', 'armor', 'vehicles', 'backgrounds', 'etc', 'are', 'good', 'understand', ""'re"", 'better', 'here', 'earlier', 'episodes', 'easy', 'enough', 'eyes', 'said', 'animation', ""n't"", 'that', 'good', ""n't"", 'have', 'be', 'just', 'love', 'what', 'hear.I', 'may', 'start', 'putting', 'Christmas', 'birthday', 'lists', 'Now', 'have', 'taste', ""'ll"", 'want', 'see', 'where', 'started', 'how', 'progressed', ""'m"", 'not', 'gamer', ""'m"", 'probably', 'disadvantage', 'what', 'here', 'what', 'did', 'get', 'was', 'enough', 'tickle', 'funny', 'bone', 'clever', 'funny', 'stuff', 'poison', 'should', 'fill', 'cup']",N/A

Plenty of laughs, even if all of the old characters didn't make it to the party.  These stories reintroduce Church (sort of), Donut, and (eventually) Tucker.  Junior is mentioned, but never appears on-screen.  Of course, the characters from Season 6 return (Sarge, Caboose, Grif, Simmons, Lopez), and just as in Season 6, Lopez gets some of the best lines.The plot makes somewhat more sense than the Season 6 plot, but the story is mostly driven by the characters and their dysfunctional personalities and relationships.

Like its predecessor it picks up right where the last chapter left off.  After 20 episodes of serious back story the guys of RvB felt it was time to bring back the nuttiness and mayhem that they began with and let me tell you it is great. The first big positive is the return of two of the best characters. Yep you got it, Donut and Tucker make a triumphant return and they never skip a step in their hilarious hyjinxs.  Still, there is a great story in these 19 episodes and the ending is definitely one that is going to leave you wanting more. Will there be another RvB series to follow this one?
