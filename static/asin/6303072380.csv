Although it is kind of hard to imagine Byrne's character as a kind of down and out  alcoholic handyman, the interaction between his character and Debra's is touching and realistic. (known a few people like her character).  The story line is as relevant today as when this movie was made: how we treat the people who are &#34;different&#34;.",4,worth it just to see Gabriel Byrne' s butt,1390867200,"01 28, 2014",2014,419,"['Debra', 'Winger', 'fantastic', 'job', 'remainder', 'cast', 'kind', 'hard', 'imagine', 'Byrne', 'character', 'kind', 'down', 'alcoholic', 'handyman', 'interaction', 'character', 'Debra', 'touching', 'realistic', 'known', 'few', 'people', 'character', 'story', 'line', 'relevant', 'today', 'when', 'movie', 'was', 'made', 'how', 'treat', 'people', 'who', 'are', '34', 'different', '34']",N/A
354379,AE8RQHFMSLN0D,6303072380,"Anthony Damato ""Law professor""","[7, 7]","This is more of a visual essay than a movie that one can sit back and enjoy.  The question is: what happens to a young woman who always tells the truth?  The answer: in an evil world, she is hurt, betrayed, kicked around,  loses her friends, and winds up in prison.  Debra Winger makes the role  believable, and that's not easy to do.  There are also things that happen  &quot;around&quot; the Winger character that she doesn't quite see, and we  the audience don't quite see either, so we're taken by surprise.  The  director almost pulled this one off.  The two reviewers before me hated the  movie, and I can see why.  But maybe to a large extent they were thrown off  by their expectations.  The title, for instance, is ironic -- but who could  have guessed that?  (She's a dangerous woman in an evil world because she's  a truth-teller.)  The movie meanders; it's not the plot-rich kind of movie  people want, nor is it a thriller, nor a suspenser; in short, it's a  philosophical essay dressed up in movie clothes.  And if that's all you  expect, then it may be worth seeing.

354381,A16BJ43Z46QS3N,6303072380,C. L Wilson,"[0, 0]","A much, much better movie than I anticipated, with all three major characters achingly alive.  Martha (Debra Winger) could easily have been someone I know.  All the reviewers kept referring to ""mental illness, mentally disturbed, fragile grip on reality, socially maladjusted"".  I think these are all dead wrong.  She is a 10-year-old girl in a woman's body.  Mentally retarded, not mentally ill.  And Winger just dissolves into the role.  She is totally, utterly believable; you can see her mind churning in each scene.  But Hersey and Byrne are also very, very good.  Look of movie similar to ""Rich In Love"", with Albert Finney, even though this was supposed to be California, and ""Rich"" was in one of the Carolinas.  A fine ending, with lots of hope, and a hint that truth at any price may not be all bad.  Martha never lies, but even though imprisoned, she is not unhappy, and neither are Hersey or Bryne, who picks up the pieces of his life.  Lying is very much the issue here, from the first scene.  Much to think about, e.g. exactly why Martha kills Getso, lying on two planes, cheating, and stealing.",4,no title,1141171200,"03 1, 2006",2006,1108,"['much', 'much', 'better', 'movie', 'anticipated', 'three', 'major', 'characters', 'achingly', 'alive', 'Martha', 'Debra', 'Winger', 'could', 'easily', 'have', 'been', 'someone', 'know', 'reviewers', 'kept', 'referring', 'mental', 'illness', 'mentally', 'disturbed', 'fragile', 'grip', 'reality', 'socially', 'maladjusted', 'think', 'are', 'dead', 'wrong', '10-year-old', 'girl', 'woman', 'body', 'Mentally', 'retarded', 'not', 'mentally', 'ill.', 'Winger', 'just', 'role', 'totally', 'utterly', 'believable', 'can', 'see', 'mind', 'churning', 'scene', 'Hersey', 'Byrne', 'are', 'also', 'very', 'very', 'good', 'Look', 'movie', 'similar', 'Rich', 'Love', 'Albert', 'Finney', 'even', 'was', 'supposed', 'be', 'California', 'Rich', 'was', 'one', 'Carolinas', 'fine', 'ending', 'lots', 'hope', 'hint', 'truth', 'price', 'may', 'not', 'be', 'bad', 'Martha', 'never', 'even', 'imprisoned', 'not', 'unhappy', 'are', 'Hersey', 'Bryne', 'who', 'up', 'pieces', 'life', 'Lying', 'very', 'much', 'issue', 'here', 'first', 'scene', 'Much', 'think', 'e.g', 'exactly', 'why', 'Martha', 'Getso', 'lying', 'two', 'planes', 'cheating', 'stealing']",N/A
354382,AXO4PQU0XG3TG,6303072380,Dwight,"[0, 0]","Very hard to believe e.g. the tupperware.  If the title character is SURROUNDED by normal flexible people EVEN if her own family ignores her development, she would have been spoken to earlier and wised up.  Otherwise, her tendency to correct others and to be on guard is apparent in many New Yorkers usually working in courthouses and school administration.The haplessness and refusal to back down and the position that she is morally pure (white nightgown and CLEAR eyeglass frames) ... not necessarily.  Her rich widowed aunt who is only six years older than the title character should have sent or taken the title character on Mediterranean cruises on a regular basis.  It would have cured her of her penchant for those skirts at least.If she's that forbidding and judgmental and seeing through people and so against dishonesty, why does she make concessions for her aunt, the best friend and the carpenter?  I cant imagine who the intended audience film could be because it is really unappetizing.I can't believe Jan Hooks is the only one who wants to give her a makeover.  Unlike Jan Hooks, I would just slather her with cosmetics for free and take photos for her to take home and PONDER the alternatives.  Hhhh.Gabriel Byrne is totally unbelievable from his first appearance and looks like the hunchback in 1993's Secret Garden.  He circles the Barbra Hershey character like a phantom and doesn't really come off as Irish in his behavior.Anyway, the bad thing about the way this film tells the story is that it sets up the idea that murder and violence is okay if one has been goaded into it if you're mental aka assburger.  The reality is that if they didn't tend to have poor muscle tone, the Fragile X-ers of the world would probably be trafficked especially if they were as appealing and accommodating as Debra Winger even with her Clarke Kent disguise.  I feel like I am watching a background featurette for a Law and Order episode.But in the end, Goren or Stabler or that Spanish guy from Cold Case is supposed to figure out the title character is the culprit (hence the title of the movie ding ding ding).Even if she's more likeable or a member of your family or team, if she fails the character test, she has to go to jail.There were warning signs from the start of the movie - the hammer, her tendency to get her back up when someone says something that she takes personally - all that stuff - if my little brother did that, I'd kill him and he knows it - and NOBODY corrects Martha in this movie.  No one except poor Pierce Patchet tells her off - and that last scene of his is very hard to take.  There's no excuse for what she does and what she does NOT do after she does what she does.  Immediately prior to this, Debra Winger does a weird thing with her mouth that makes her look like she is impersonating someone who is mental and that's how I see this entire story.  It's an imitation to hide a killer.And if we don't get over our need to be politically correct and be nice to people who act and dress unpleasantly because they can claim Fragile X or whatever - well, like using underage perpetrators and inebriation for vehicular murder, it would make anyone diagnosed with that genetic mutation have a socially accepted excuse for socially unacceptable behavior.Murder's murder.This movie is why Jennifer Aniston movies make money.Trust your eyes and give this movie a pass and spare yourself the last line of this movie.If Eichmann embodied the banality of evil, this movie represents the retardedness of evil.",2,cinemasins defying belief,1404604800,"07 6, 2014",2014,3535,"['Very', 'hard', 'believe', 'e.g', 'tupperware', 'title', 'character', 'SURROUNDED', 'normal', 'flexible', 'people', 'EVEN', 'own', 'family', 'development', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'spoken', 'earlier', 'wised', 'up', 'Otherwise', 'tendency', 'correct', 'others', 'be', 'guard', 'apparent', 'many', 'New', 'Yorkers', 'usually', 'working', 'courthouses', 'school', 'administration.The', 'haplessness', 'refusal', 'back', 'down', 'position', 'morally', 'pure', 'white', 'nightgown', 'CLEAR', 'eyeglass', 'frames', 'not', 'necessarily', 'rich', 'widowed', 'aunt', 'who', 'only', 'six', 'years', 'older', 'title', 'character', 'should', 'have', 'sent', 'taken', 'title', 'character', 'Mediterranean', 'cruises', 'regular', 'basis', 'would', 'have', 'cured', 'penchant', 'skirts', 'least.If', 'forbidding', 'judgmental', 'seeing', 'people', 'so', 'dishonesty', 'why', 'make', 'concessions', 'aunt', 'best', 'friend', 'carpenter', 'cant', 'imagine', 'who', 'intended', 'audience', 'film', 'could', 'be', 'really', 'unappetizing.I', 'ca', ""n't"", 'believe', 'Jan', 'Hooks', 'only', 'one', 'who', 'give', 'makeover', 'Jan', 'Hooks', 'would', 'just', 'slather', 'cosmetics', 'free', 'take', 'photos', 'take', 'home', 'PONDER', 'alternatives', 'Hhhh.Gabriel', 'Byrne', 'totally', 'unbelievable', 'first', 'appearance', 'hunchback', '1993', 'Secret', 'Garden', 'Barbra', 'Hershey', 'character', 'phantom', ""n't"", 'really', 'come', 'off', 'Irish', 'behavior.Anyway', 'bad', 'thing', 'way', 'film', 'story', 'up', 'idea', 'murder', 'violence', 'okay', 'one', 'been', 'goaded', ""'re"", 'mental', 'aka', 'assburger', 'reality', 'did', ""n't"", 'tend', 'have', 'poor', 'muscle', 'tone', 'Fragile', 'X-ers', 'world', 'would', 'probably', 'be', 'trafficked', 'especially', 'were', 'appealing', 'accommodating', 'Debra', 'Winger', 'even', 'Clarke', 'Kent', 'disguise', 'feel', 'am', 'watching', 'background', 'featurette', 'Law', 'Order', 'episode.But', 'end', 'Goren', 'Stabler', 'Spanish', 'guy', 'Cold', 'Case', 'supposed', 'figure', 'out', 'title', 'character', 'culprit', 'hence', 'title', 'movie', 'ding', 'ding', 'ding', '.Even', 'more', 'likeable', 'member', 'family', 'team', 'character', 'test', 'go', 'jail.There', 'were', 'warning', 'signs', 'start', 'movie', 'hammer', 'tendency', 'get', 'back', 'up', 'when', 'someone', 'something', 'personally', 'little', 'brother', 'did', ""'d"", 'kill', 'NOBODY', 'Martha', 'movie', 'one', 'poor', 'Pierce', 'Patchet', 'last', 'scene', 'very', 'hard', 'take', 'excuse', 'what', 'what', 'NOT', 'do', 'what', 'Immediately', 'prior', 'Debra', 'Winger', 'weird', 'thing', 'mouth', 'look', 'impersonating', 'someone', 'who', 'mental', 'how', 'see', 'entire', 'story', 'imitation', 'hide', 'killer.And', 'do', ""n't"", 'get', 'need', 'be', 'politically', 'correct', 'be', 'nice', 'people', 'who', 'act', 'dress', 'unpleasantly', 'can', 'claim', 'Fragile', 'X', 'well', 'using', 'underage', 'perpetrators', 'inebriation', 'vehicular', 'murder', 'would', 'make', 'anyone', 'diagnosed', 'genetic', 'mutation', 'have', 'socially', 'accepted', 'excuse', 'socially', 'unacceptable', 'behavior.Murder', 'murder.This', 'movie', 'why', 'Jennifer', 'Aniston', 'movies', 'make', 'money.Trust', 'eyes', 'give', 'movie', 'pass', 'spare', 'last', 'line', 'movie.If', 'Eichmann', 'embodied', 'banality', 'evil', 'movie', 'retardedness', 'evil']",N/A
