Ray ""Like Old Movies""","[0, 0]","The problems people had in old days of B&W were amusing and real, much easier to watch than some things people in more modern movies find themselves wrapped up in.  Innocence is probably the best word, or possibly Capra-esque. I remember the Jane Wyman TV show; she is very spirited.

434927,A1ERNG8ZJCW5CB,630476300X,Bridget Schabron,"[0, 0]","Jane Wyman's character is probably in her early twenties, and ready to leave home for adventure.  For her, that adventure lies in the skies, working as a stewardess.  But little does she know the real adventures awaiting her involve three very different, and nice, guys, all with one thing in common:  their names.  The first Mike she insults and he can't stand her at the start, but then quickly comes to her aid when she makes a mistake that could have gotten her fired from the airlines.  The second Mike helps her out of a jam when her car breaks down, and soon is attracted to her enthusiasm for life, and wants to use that for his advertising business.  And the third Mike, well, Jane can't quite figure him out at first.  He's so quiet, and yet not snobbish, and she tells her stewardess friend on the plan she thinks he's someone very important.  Well, she starts to get to know him, not at some conference with him speaking, but right there on the plane when he teaches a child who refuses to sleep on the overnight flight about the stars.  What happens next I shouldn't say, as part of the fun of the movie is seeing it unfold, with all the drama, comic mishaps, and also quiet scenes where Jane gets to know the Mike she'll come to love.I like the fact that there was actually more depth to this movie than I expected, with discussions between characters that reminds me of real life choices.  Such as, do you want to settle down and have one home, or is it more important to you to be able to travel all around the world?  Do you want to live the fancy, rich life, or is a quiet life with a family in a small town, perhaps a college town, more your style?  Jane has to make all these decisions and more.I highly recommend this movie.

434949,A4JHEO7H330AF,630476300X,Tom Brody,"[1, 1]","THREE GUYS NAMED MIKE is a movie from the second best year of my life, namely, the year that I was born.  The best year was the year that my daughter was born, which by definition came a bit later on.  Anyway, the film is a 90 minute black and white comedy about a newly trained stewardess, and three upper-middle class courters.  All three are named, ""Mike,"" thus the title of the movie.  All three of these Mikes readily become infatuated with the stewardess, and pursue her for marriage.THREE PERSONALITIES.  Mike #1 is the first to appear, and he is an airline pilot who happens to give the stewardess a lift when her cab breaks down.  It is my guess that few people would consider an airline pilot as suitable ""husband"" material, all other things being equal, since he is away from home all of the time, and is not allowed to chit-chat with the wife when he is at work and in the cockpit. Mike #2 is an advertising man, which is probably a plus in terms of making a fine husband.  Mike #2 first meets the stewardess when he offers roadside assistance when the stewardess' battery in her automobile goes dead. However, Mike #2 as played in this movie, is an older man, and probably is not optimally compatible with the stewardess who is in her early 20s.  Also, Mike #2 has formulated the idea that the destiny of the stewardess is to bear him six children.  Hence, the viewer of this movie might also decide, well before the ending, that Mike #2 would be less favored as a husband.  Mike #3 is a passenger on an airplane, who bumps into the stewardess at a second location, namely at a restaurant where he is bartending.  He seems remote, when he is a passenger, because he is busy reading a book, and is not interested in chit-chatting with the stewardess.  Mike #3 is a biochemistry graduate student, who on occasion, bartends on the side to supplement his meager stipend.  Mike #3 is doing research experiments on bioluminesence.  I was shocked, but pleasantly surprised, when Mike #3 explained the substrates and enzyme involved in bioluminesence.  In a scene in Mike #3's laboratory, the viewer is treated to a one liter Erlenmeyer flask filled with glowing bacteria.  I was shocked that the biochemistry of luminescence would be described in a movie dating from 1951.  The stewardess is not at all fazed by Mike #3's description of biochemistry, and she very easily pronounces ""bioluminescence"" and in fact, she recognizes Mike #3's supervisor because she had read his biology textbook when she was in school before becoming a stewardess.This movie is a product of its era, in part, because of the film's emphasis on biochemistry.  Please recall that Hans Krebs got the Nobel Prize in 1953 for discovering the Krebs Cycle (just 2 years after this movie came out).  But in additional aspects, it is further evident that this movie is a product of its era (see below).THE ERA IN HISTORY.  All three Mikes represent the ""New Wave"" of culture, which materialized after World War II.  This New Wave of culture has been documented in abundance in history books, films, and other media.  The 1950s brought technological advances, including boosts to the commercial airline industry resulting from the onset of radar and other inventions that materialized during WWII.  The media, novels, and literature, from the 1950s and 1960s, also glamorized and sometimes demonized the advertising executive.  Please see, for example, the films TWELVE ANGRY MEN, which depicts the glib manner of a handsome ad-man.  Please also see, A STOP AT WILLOUGHBY, and WALKING DISTANCE, which are Twilight Zone stories depicting the high-pressure nature of the advertising industry. In this time in history, if you were Puerto Rican, Mexican American, or African American, you were marginalized in the job market, and also mariginalized in movies.  Such is the case in this movie.  Also, in this era, women were expected to cook and make babies and to not have a career.  This aspect of history is presented in this movie, but this movie (believe it or not), fights back, and the stewardess is depicted as an intelligent person and not in any way as a bimbo.HANKY-PANKY.  This film is filled with mild references to hanky panky.  For example, in a scene about an airplane, an elderly man tries to get a date with the stewardess, and as part of his insistent ploy, gives the stewardess the keys to his hotel room.  Another elderly man, farther back in the airplane, is equally insistent in getting a date with the stewardess.  Thinking quickly, the stewardess agrees for a date with the elderly man at the rear of the airplane, and she hands him the hotel room keys.  The elderly man's eyes glow happily with anticipation and excitement.  In the laboratory scene, Mike #3 tells the stewardess that he needs to switch off the lights.  For a moment, the stewardess thinks that he is going to try some romance, but she quickly learns that instead it is so that she can observe the light from the glowing bacteria.MAKES YOUR HEAD SWIM.  After a half hour, it is apparent that THREE GUYS NAMED MIKE is intended to be over the top.  The stewardess chit-chat with each other giddily, in mindless happy-talk.  Every 10 or 15 minutes or so, there is a chance encounter where two of the Mikes bump into each other.  Eventually, there is one scene, where all three Mikes are in the same room together, and learn that they are not alone in pursuing the stewardess.  And after that, near the end, there is a scene where all three Mikes get in a fist fight with each other, where a photo of the fistfight appears in a tabloid, and where the result is that all three Mikes either lose their job or are demoted at their job.  The take-home lesson is that, if you do not like fast-paced movies that have improbable, over-the-top storylines, and that make your head swim, then do not watch this film.  But if you do not mind over-the-top storylines, then this film will be engrossing to you.CONCLUSION.  I liked this movie for the above-disclosed reasons, but also because there was no violence, no computer graphics, and no naughty words.  But most of all, I liked this movie because of its disclosure of the biochemistry of luminescence.  Please note that, green fluorescent protein was the subject of the Nobel Prize in Medicine in the year 2008.  At the end of the film, all three Mikes meet again (purely by coincidence, of course) at the airport, and all three Mikes ask the stewardess to get married.  She says ""no"" to the first two, after each asks, ""Will you marry me.""  Then the proposal from Mike #3 goes like this, ""I love you.""  Because of this truly unusual approach, which Mike #1 and Mike #2 had neglected to use, the stewardess agrees and answers yes to the biochemist.",5,"I love comedies about biochemistry, including THREE
