I have never found a TV series so hilarious. And I have never found a TV series so moving.I suspect that in order for Community to have a similar type of effect on you, you must meet at least two criteria: (1) be between 20 and 35 years old, and (2) give your full attention to every nano-second of the show.Re: (2): There is so much substance packed into every nano-second of the show that it demands your full attention to notice the subtleties and to understand exactly what the show's writers are trying to get at. You'll probably need/want to watch some episodes several times.Re: (1): The first time I saw the show was at my parents' house, and while I was literally - not figuratively - screaming like an injured lemur with laughter, my Boomer parents barely managed a polite smile. The generational divide was never so apparent.The show speaks directly to my generation, and not just to amuse us, but to tell us things we urgently need to hear. E.g.:* ""Britta's attracted to men in emotional pain. It helps her think that she's emotionally healthy.""* ""Jeff, you're a normal person. There's nothing very special about you at all. You're going to be great at a few things but really crappy at many more.""* ""While claiming to have no religion, you're actually devoutly worshipping yourself.""* ""We need more respect and less passion.""* ""TV makes sense. It has structure, logic, rules, and likeable leading men. In life we have this. We have you.""And there's so much more that isn't easily pick-up-able from little lines of dialogue. The general message of the show is (crudely) wake up, grow up, what's important is right in front of you.God bless Dan Harmon. May he make many more TV shows.---Regarding Season 1 in particular, the least appealing episode is probably the first, when the series and characters are still flailing around trying to figure out who/what they're going to be. After that it's consistently very good. The high points are ""Introduction to Film,"" ""Physical Education,"" and ""English as a Second Language."" And then of course there is the most epic (which is very different from saying the ""best"") episode of the whole series: ""Modern Warfare.""",5,"If a better TV series has been created, I politely demand you to tell me what it is",1334534400,"04 16, 2012",2012,2299,"['better', 'TV', 'series', 'been', 'created', 'politely', 'demand', 'tell', 'what', 'have', 'never', 'been', 'so', 'riveted', 'TV', 'series', 'have', 'never', 'found', 'TV', 'series', 'so', 'hilarious', 'have', 'never', 'found', 'TV', 'series', 'moving.I', 'suspect', 'order', 'Community', 'have', 'similar', 'type', 'effect', 'must', 'meet', 'least', 'two', 'criteria', '1', 'be', '20', '35', 'years', 'old', '2', 'give', 'full', 'attention', 'nano-second', 'show.Re', '2', 'so', 'much', 'substance', 'packed', 'nano-second', 'show', 'full', 'attention', 'notice', 'subtleties', 'understand', 'exactly', 'what', 'show', 'writers', 'are', 'trying', 'get', ""'ll"", 'probably', 'need/want', 'watch', 'episodes', 'several', 'times.Re', '1', 'first', 'time', 'saw', 'show', 'was', 'parents', 'house', 'was', 'literally', 'not', 'figuratively', 'screaming', 'injured', 'lemur', 'laughter', 'Boomer', 'parents', 'barely', 'managed', 'polite', 'smile', 'generational', 'divide', 'was', 'never', 'so', 'apparent.The', 'show', 'directly', 'generation', 'not', 'just', 'amuse', 'tell', 'things', 'urgently', 'need', 'hear', 'E.g', '*', 'Britta', 'attracted', 'men', 'emotional', 'pain', 'think', 'emotionally', 'healthy', '*', 'Jeff', ""'re"", 'normal', 'person', 'nothing', 'very', 'special', ""'re"", 'going', 'be', 'great', 'few', 'things', 'really', 'crappy', 'many', 'more', '*', 'claiming', 'have', 'religion', ""'re"", 'actually', 'devoutly', 'worshipping', '*', 'need', 'more', 'respect', 'less', 'passion', '*', 'TV', 'sense', 'structure', 'logic', 'rules', 'likeable', 'leading', 'men', 'life', 'have', 'have', 'so', 'much', 'more', ""n't"", 'easily', 'pick-up-able', 'little', 'lines', 'dialogue', 'general', 'message', 'show', 'crudely', 'wake', 'up', 'grow', 'up', 'what', 'important', 'right', 'front', 'you.God', 'bless', 'Dan', 'Harmon', 'May', 'make', 'many', 'more', 'TV', 'shows.', '-Regarding', 'Season', '1', 'particular', 'least', 'appealing', 'episode', 'probably', 'first', 'when', 'series', 'characters', 'are', 'still', 'flailing', 'around', 'trying', 'figure', 'out', 'who/what', ""'re"", 'going', 'be', 'consistently', 'very', 'good', 'high', 'points', 'are', 'Introduction', 'Film', 'Physical', 'Education', 'English', 'Second', 'Language', 'then', 'course', 'most', 'epic', 'very', 'different', 'saying', 'best', 'episode', 'whole', 'series', 'Modern', 'Warfare']",Community: Season 1

There are no weak characters in the ensemble, but the actress who plays Britta is by far the least talented, and occasionally makes me cringe with her obvious acting. Because of this, her character is the roughest sketch and does not always ring true. Had the actress who plays Annie been cast as Britta, her character would have surely been up with the rest. There have been a few bad arcs with Pierce going on a dark and mean streak that just is not funny or fun (Chevy Chase's acting is never the issue). But the rest of the show and cast is so strong, I happily sit through a few bad moments for one of the greatest comedy shows of all time. My favorite line so far is ""slurred speech"".

1279260,A1CQGAPQMN41LV,B002N5N5LG,"A. Whitehead ""Werthead""","[0, 0]","Jeff Winger is a hotshot lawyer whose career has been brought to a screeching halt due to the slight problem of his qualifications being non-existent. He has to attend Greendale Community College for four years and pass a series of tests to regain his law credentials. An attempt to seduce a fellow student, Britta, by inviting her to a fictitious study group spirals out of control, resulting in the creation of a real study group. As the group goes through the school year, they learn and grow together. And also inadvertently create a copyright-infringing school anthem, give the college a guy in a gimp suit as its mascot and then almost destroy the place in a titanic paintball game that goes horrendously awry.Community is entering its fourth season in the USA, but may be one of the best-kept secrets on television. Airing to mediocre ratings in the States and having almost no profile at all in the UK, it's nevertheless a funny, confident show which acts as both an obvious comedy and also something of a commentary on social dynamics and pop culture. The 'community' of the title is a reference to the central characters, who are all outcasts of one type of another, and their bonding together, and also to the wider college around them, personified through a recurring cast of tutors and other students.Early episodes are mostly spent with the show trying to avoid cliches, with the character of Abed (Danny Pudi) always ready to compare an episode's storyline to something he saw on Friends or M*A*S*H*. This constant meta-commentary and attempts at ironic post-post-modernism are amusing but also slightly tiresome, with the show occasionally feeling a little smug with itself or else flailing at trying not to be caught between cliches. However, it's not long before the writers stop caring about that (at least quite so much) and instead concentrate on having fun. Community melds both the characters and the situations they encounter into compelling storylines that feel a lot longer than their modest 22 minutes-per-episode run times would suggest.The actors are all excellent in their roles, particularly Joel McHale as Jeff, who has to make an inherently unlikable character likable without weakening the character, which he just about manages to do. The aforementioned Pudi is also great at portraying a character who initially appears to be the most predictable of the group but rapidly develops some interesting depths. Donald Glover takes the initially dull character of Troy and rapidly (by the end of episode two and its iconic Spanish rap number) turns him into a highlight of the show, thanks to some great comic timing. Yvette Nicole Brown's Shirley initially appears to be the 'mother' figure of the show, but some revelations about her personal life and gossipping tendencies turn that on its head. There's also a glorious cynicism about the character of Pearce (played by Chevy Chase, enjoying a career resurgence), a casually sexist and racist old man whose role in the group appears to primarily be making the other characters feel good about themselves. Alison Brie and Gillian Jacobs round off the primary cast as Annie and Britta, who initially both seem fairly straightforward characters before gaining more layers as the season progresses.Slightly less successful are the supporting characters, most notably Ken Jeong as 'Senor' Chang whose character is rather broad (more effectively in some episodes than others) and Jim Rash as the Dean, who random weirdness (he has a sexual predilection for people in dalmatian costumes) is wearying. Still, both have their strong moments as the season progresses.After the first few, slightly more pedestrian episodes, the season takes an upward turn in quality, culminating in the now-legendary paintball episode, Modern Warfare, when the show's ingredients combine together to create something hilarious, mildly emotional and completely demented, leaving the viewer eager to see what the writers and cast can do in the second year.Season 1 of Community (****) is well-written, sharply-acted and finely-observed, with more going on under the hood than you might expect from a situation comedy.",5,A superb comedy about social relationships and pop culture,1348185600,"09 21, 2012",2012,4171,"['Jeff', 'Winger', 'hotshot', 'lawyer', 'career', 'been', 'brought', 'screeching', 'halt', 'due', 'slight', 'problem', 'qualifications', 'being', 'non-existent', 'attend', 'Greendale', 'Community', 'College', 'four', 'years', 'pass', 'series', 'tests', 'regain', 'law', 'credentials', 'attempt', 'seduce', 'fellow', 'student', 'Britta', 'inviting', 'fictitious', 'study', 'group', 'control', 'resulting', 'creation', 'real', 'study', 'group', 'group', 'school', 'year', 'learn', 'grow', 'together', 'also', 'inadvertently', 'create', 'copyright-infringing', 'school', 'anthem', 'give', 'college', 'guy', 'gimp', 'suit', 'mascot', 'then', 'almost', 'destroy', 'place', 'titanic', 'paintball', 'game', 'horrendously', 'awry.Community', 'entering', 'fourth', 'season', 'USA', 'may', 'be', 'one', 'best-kept', 'secrets', 'television', 'Airing', 'mediocre', 'ratings', 'States', 'having', 'almost', 'profile', 'UK', 'nevertheless', 'funny', 'confident', 'show', 'obvious', 'comedy', 'also', 'something', 'commentary', 'social', 'dynamics', 'pop', 'culture', ""'community"", 'title', 'reference', 'central', 'characters', 'who', 'are', 'outcasts', 'one', 'type', 'bonding', 'together', 'also', 'wider', 'college', 'personified', 'recurring', 'cast', 'tutors', 'other', 'students.Early', 'episodes', 'are', 'mostly', 'spent', 'show', 'trying', 'avoid', 'cliches', 'character', 'Abed', 'Danny', 'Pudi', 'always', 'ready', 'compare', 'episode', 'storyline', 'something', 'saw', 'Friends', 'M*A*S*H*', 'constant', 'meta-commentary', 'attempts', 'ironic', 'post-post-modernism', 'are', 'amusing', 'also', 'slightly', 'tiresome', 'show', 'occasionally', 'feeling', 'little', 'smug', 'else', 'flailing', 'trying', 'not', 'be', 'caught', 'cliches', 'However', 'not', 'long', 'writers', 'stop', 'caring', 'least', 'quite', 'so', 'much', 'instead', 'concentrate', 'having', 'fun', 'Community', 'characters', 'situations', 'encounter', 'compelling', 'storylines', 'feel', 'lot', 'longer', 'modest', '22', 'minutes-per-episode', 'run', 'times', 'would', 'suggest.The', 'actors', 'are', 'excellent', 'roles', 'particularly', 'Joel', 'McHale', 'Jeff', 'who', 'make', 'inherently', 'unlikable', 'character', 'likable', 'weakening', 'character', 'just', 'manages', 'do', 'aforementioned', 'Pudi', 'also', 'great', 'portraying', 'character', 'who', 'initially', 'be', 'most', 'predictable', 'group', 'rapidly', 'interesting', 'depths', 'Donald', 'Glover', 'initially', 'dull', 'character', 'Troy', 'rapidly', 'end', 'episode', 'two', 'iconic', 'Spanish', 'rap', 'number', 'highlight', 'show', 'thanks', 'great', 'comic', 'timing', 'Yvette', 'Nicole', 'Brown', 'Shirley', 'initially', 'be', ""'mother"", 'figure', 'show', 'revelations', 'personal', 'life', 'gossipping', 'tendencies', 'turn', 'head', 'also', 'glorious', 'cynicism', 'character', 'Pearce', 'played', 'Chevy', 'Chase', 'enjoying', 'career', 'resurgence', 'casually', 'sexist', 'racist', 'old', 'man', 'role', 'group', 'primarily', 'be', 'making', 'other', 'characters', 'feel', 'good', 'Alison', 'Brie', 'Gillian', 'Jacobs', 'round', 'off', 'primary', 'cast', 'Annie', 'Britta', 'who', 'initially', 'seem', 'fairly', 'straightforward', 'characters', 'gaining', 'more', 'layers', 'season', 'progresses.Slightly', 'less', 'successful', 'are', 'supporting', 'characters', 'most', 'notably', 'Ken', 'Jeong', ""'Senor"", 'Chang', 'character', 'rather', 'broad', 'more', 'effectively', 'episodes', 'others', 'Jim', 'Rash', 'Dean', 'who', 'weirdness', 'sexual', 'predilection', 'people', 'dalmatian', 'costumes', 'wearying', 'Still', 'have', 'strong', 'moments', 'season', 'progresses.After', 'first', 'few', 'slightly', 'more', 'pedestrian', 'episodes', 'season', 'upward', 'turn', 'quality', 'culminating', 'now-legendary', 'paintball', 'episode', 'Modern', 'Warfare', 'when', 'show', 'ingredients', 'combine', 'together', 'create', 'something', 'hilarious', 'mildly', 'emotional', 'completely', 'demented', 'leaving', 'viewer', 'eager', 'see', 'what', 'writers', 'cast', 'can', 'do', 'second', 'year.Season', '1', 'Community', '****', 'well-written', 'sharply-acted', 'finely-observed', 'more', 'going', 'hood', 'might', 'expect', 'situation', 'comedy']",Community: Season 1

1279264,A1ELOBOYQD6UMQ,B002N5N5LG,Cagneyfan67,"[0, 0]",I remember I was first introduced to community when I was very sick and it provides a lot laughs. I feel in love with the show and let go of a lot of the stress I was under. Alison Brie was my favorite. I thought her character was cute. Joel Mchale comes off as a character hard to like but he plays it well enough you can see there is a good guy inside of him. Danny Pudi gives one if not the best acting performances. His character is not easy to play and becomes a series favorite. His character Abed is very into film and I can relate. I like to collect movies and talk about them. Chevy Chase best known for the Vacation movies makes a strong comeback here as a rich old man going to community college to fill his time and make some friends. His character is not likable but there are a lot of shades of the old Chevy Chase from the Vacation from the 80s movies not the one who faded away in the 90s. Donald Glover does a great job playing the ex football star who got injured and could not play football anymore thus fore fitting any scholarships given to him by colleges to play football. His character starts off to be a little full of myself and tries to act like he's a tough guy. Troy is really sensitive and Abed the character he makes fun of so much in the pilot ends up being his best friend. Glover and Pudi play great together as friends. Gillian Jacobs is another one of my favorites. I could identify with her as her character is my age and still deciding what to do with her life. College seems to be a good option for her. Jacobs is a smart character not easily to be fooled by Mchale and his elaborate plans to hook up with her. The two have a great relationship. They play off each other well but perhaps Britta's character change in Season 3 was best. It made her character more fun and Jacobs got to show off her talents showing two different sides of the character. I find Britta adorable and silly. Yvette Nicole Brown plays a mom returning to school. She is very religious. She is like a mother to the girls and also like one of them when gossiping. She clearly has a good heart and one of the more likable characters on the show. I highly recommend you tune into this show. The hardcore fans have prevented the show from being cancelled the past three seasons. There is a reason the show is still on. Community has a cult like following and perhaps not everyone will get the humor but I suggest you rent it from your local library and give it a try. Community has made me smile during some of the more trying times of my life. I hope it will do the same for you!

The Results? I wish I went to this Community College...First off, the show does take great liberties with the setting. My experience may have differed from the norm, but mostly what I saw was a bunch of apathetic people who couldn't wait till the moment they could get back home. They would never go to a candlelight vigil at night for example. The people of Greendale are the opposite of that. They care about EVERYTHING. They will create a candlelight vigil for wacky causes, and bake cookies for everybody there. Of course, the setting also gives a great sense of openness and freedom for the show. In this world, the possibilities are endless and anything can happen.Next up, the stories. At the beginning, the show struggled hard to find itself, being more hit or miss more than anything, but after the first 5-10 episodes, the show really entered its own. A relationship doesn't work? Drop it! A pairing doesn't work? Separate them! Two actors had more chemistry then you originally realized? Put them together! A personality is too negative? Change it, then make jokes about it! Nothing holds this show down, and each time it comes down with more flair than the last time. May I also note that almost every episode takes advantage of each classroom setting really well? Plus, especially towards the end of the season, the episodes turn into complete brilliant parodies. An episode that takes on ""Goodfellas"" and other mafia movies? Do it! It's hilarious!Plus, the cast is great for everything that is thrown at them. Joel McHale is excellent of course, Chevy Chase does a serviceable job, and everybody else, who were basically unknowns before the show, really break out here. This includes Donald Glover, Allison Brie, etc. Plus, Ken Jeong is great as always, and that's always a plus.If you're still not convinced of the brilliance of Community, watch ""Modern Warfare."" Not overrated in the slightest, it's the best episode of TV period of the last 6 months, and the best episode of comedy in the past year. Everything that makes this show so great came together PERFECTLY for this episode to absolutely gut-wrenching comedy.

1279284,A2HVL790PBWYTU,B002N5N5LG,"H. Bala ""Me Too Can Read""","[0, 0]","COMMUNITY is undeniably streets ahead. If you want to know what the fuss is all about, and the furor and the hullabaloo, then you ought to give COMMUNITY a try. While the season's first half is mostly the show trying to get its sea legs - and so there are episodes which are a bit shaky - press on, sir, and you'll get to the turnaround. From the Christmas episode on, COMMUNITY picks up momentum and begins to consistently knock it out the park. Except, even before that, there were already glimmers of awesome. Like Troy and Abed's Spanish rap to close out the second episode (""Spanish 101"") or Vaughn's song, ""Gettin' Rid of Britta"" (""Home Economics""), or Abed dressed up as Batman in the Halloween episode (""Introduction to Statistics"").Even though the show is about a, well, community of people of all ages and from all walks of life attending community college, our point-of-view character is initially Jeff Winger (Joel McHale), a smug lawyer who was disallowed from plying his craft when the state bar learned that his law degree is from Colombia instead of Columbia. So he's forced to enroll in Greendale Community College. This show is as much about Jeff Winger's redemption from a shady counselor who is endlessly manipulative to a better human being (who, okay, is still pretty manipulative). Thru Jeff - who establishes a fake Spanish study group so that he can chat up pretty fellow student Britta (Jillian Jacobs) - we meet the rest of the diverse cast.I like me the unapologetic snark, and COMMUNITY happens not only to shovel in the meta-references, it also parodies everything under the sun, and does it in sharp, wicked ways. But a sense of the ridiculous also infuses the stories, and I love that because I'm down with the goofy stuff as well. It all culminates in the funniest half-hour of television in 2010, the paintball episode ""Modern Warfare,"" a sublime send-up of the action/post-apocalyptic horror genre. This episode also escalates Jeff and Britta's ongoing flirtation to the next level.I had never heard of any of the actors before, except for Chevy Chase but I warmed up to the cast soon enough. Donald Glover (""Troy"") and Danny Pudi (""Abed"") in particular just have this very cool chemistry, and they're very funny together. One of the things I look forward to are the closing credit tags which prominently feature Troy and Abed. And while I was on board with the Jeff/Britta thing, the show does throw an excellent plot swerve in the final episode. And the rabid Spanish 101 instructor, Se&ntilde;or Chang, is always good for chuckles. Heck, even Chevy Chase folds neatly into the group.There are so many terrific episodes, but if I have to highlight a few... There's the Halloween episode ""Introduction to Statistics"" which has Chevy under the influence and introduces Jeff's hot statistics professor. And also ""Debate 109"" which pits indifferent debater Jeff against a charismatic disabled opponent. The Christmas episode smiles at re1igion and ends in a free-for-all, all-hands-on-deck scrap. Most of the episodes from then on are pretty gold, including most definitely ""Contemporary American Poultry,"" which satirizes gangster films like GOODFELLAS, and, of course, the awesomely awesome ""Modern Warfare."" The neat thing is that these actors are frequently called on to be silly and over-the-top, and yet they ground their performances enough that you do end up caring what happens to their characters. Except maybe for Se&ntilde;or Chang. Even Chevy Chase says he's abrasive.The DVD set isn't stingy with the bonus features:- Cast & Crew Commentary for each episode- An Outtake Reel for each disc- Alternate Scenes from the ""Advanced Criminal Law"" episode- ""Creative Compromises"" - tongue-in-cheek featurette in which show creator Dan Harmon harps on about the creative changes the show's had to make to appease the network executives; oh, that poor Gillian Jacobs (00:02:52 minutes)- ""Season One Cast Evaluations"" - Another not-to-be-taken-too-seriously featurette in which Dan Harmon sits each cast member down and evaluates their performances throughout the first season (00:11:41 minutes)- 3 Mini-Episodes- Season One Highlight Reel- Extended Producer's Cut of the ""Communication Studies"" episode- The DVD package also comes with the mini comic book, ""Kickpuncher,"" drawn by indie comic book artist Jim Mahfood and supposedly written by Troy Barnes",5,"""You know I thought you were like Bill Murray in

1279285,A31P94HJVZ6WRF,B002N5N5LG,HeroicTimes,"[2, 22]","Having just watched all of the first season of COMMUNITY, I thought I would jot off a quick review, that I think would have been very helpful to myself before purchasing this series.I was swayed by the reviews which unfortunately had this being the best thing in the universe, with little to no moderating reviews. Having watched the series, I have to say while not horrible, I did have some problems, and in the scheme of things find myself far closer to the 2 star grades than the 5.The show is not horrible. It has its moments, at times it's brilliant, one of the standout episodes being PAINTBALL.And the cast has talented character actors, that could be interesting characters. Unfortunately by the time you get halfway through the season writer/creator Dan Harmon, has fallen into the rut of not developing most of the characters beyond stereotypes.While I think he's trying to do something interesting with some of the characters, most notably the character of Abed played by Danny Pudi, who I think is great (Though I understand how Arabs may not really dig the idea of an Indian playing an Arab. Not an isolated incident in Hollywood). Unfortunately for every Abed it seems you also have to get a Troy.Don't get me wrong, I like Donald Glover, but I think the character of Troy falls back into the happy medium of White writer writing weak or flawed or sexless or emasculated or non-threathening Black Male characters. You see that a lot in television, and hell going back to vaudville, writers working out their issues of fear and race through ""humor""/ridicule. But god we've seen that same tune sung so often, that it is a glaring, and boring, and uninteresting stereotype. I would rather a writer not have Black characters in the show, rather than drag the characters into the show to do his version of Step and fetchit. To bring characters of color in, only to break them down. Be it Buffy, or Smallville or the first season of the new Dr. Who, etc.And the craziest thing is these writers think they are being edgy, and cutting edge, and original, and liberal, when what they are being is very predictable, very 1920s, very tired, and very bigoted. Note to Dan Harmon... tokenism... it is just what it sounds like.The dumb over-compensating funny Black jock was just about passable the first half of the year, because at the very least you had the romantic subplot that gave you a hint there could be more there. But by the end of the season you have the dumb-over compensating funny Black Jock eunuch, which is oddly enough also a reoccurring Hollywood staple.Nice one, Dan. Didn't see that coming.It's just tired, tired writing.I mean, and this is not to fault the actors, they do the best in the horrible stereotypes they are given to work in, and it's a testament to their skill that I like them, despite the limitations. But I'm nagged incessantly by the fact that I would like them a lot more if they were more than their foibles. I would like them a lot more if they had contrasting cool Black characters to play off of. It would be great the day Black characters can be represented by their ""Peirce"" but also have their ""Jeff"". Or have their  ""Shirley"" but also have their ""Britta"". Have the same diversity of quirky and cool characters that White actors get.Unfortunately, that's what tokenism does, it gives only a narrow view, to a broad people. And usually it's the worst, most dismissive, most denigrating view possible. Which listening to Dan Harmon in the commentaries he comes across as more than a bit dismissive and denigrating.All in all, by the end, I felt the show does a disservice to Harmon to write it, and it does a disservice to Glover to perform it. Add to this the character of Shirley (My God, is that a call back to ""what's happening?""!!) the sassy, but matronly, Black woman. My God we haven't seen that a thousand times. Black women seemingly to White writers in Hollywood, can only be perceived as Hors (ala Halle Berry) or as sassy, bossy matrons, but nothing in between.Good, one Dan. Way to be original.Let's try something new. How about something crazy, Black guy gets the girl. The hot Black, smart girl. Or the Hot White, smart girl. Wow, imagine that. Oh, wait... that would mean moving out of the 1920s.So yeah by the end of the season, the blatant stereotyping, took away from what I thought was otherwise an interesting show.I mean at the price it currently is of like $12 for the entire season, it's worth getting if only to see the paintball episode. Then sell the thing when done. You'll make out far cheaper than renting. But just realize, you're going to see something perhaps a little more flawed than Amazon reviews lets on.

1279286,A1UV1GD4DFXLEM,B002N5N5LG,"Hucklebarry ""Hucklebarry""","[11, 11]","With Scrubs being finished and The Office in its 7th season, I was needing something new.  I'm a sitcom fan.  Seinfeld, Friends, Simpsons, IT Crowd, The office, Scrubs, and now the Community all sit on my shelf.  I don't think its because the Community being newer is why I like it the best.  I think its because it takes a style from everything that has worked before it and incorporated into something a little diverse.The overall synopsis has been tried a thousand times... An unlikely and diverse group is forced together and nothing is as it seems.  But they do so much more than try to revitalize a century old idea.The large cast is at the top of their game.  They work well together and no one really steals the show (which I think is a very good thing).  While Jeff is billed as the 'leader' he very heavily relies on EVERYONE and their story.  At any time someone could be left out or someone, anyone could be focused on and it would work for a time.The story remembers itself.  Each episode isn't a new 20 minutes that start from scratch.  If someone broke their leg last week they are in a cast or limping the following week.  Its not like the Simpsons where they draw in a door slot when its convenient or they themselves joke about how the plots rarely remember or explain major previous events.  Every episode adds to the community cannon that will be drawn upon in the future.The characters are aware of the outside world.  They can joke about politics, companies, religions, hollywood, etc.  The show is set in a real world which adds a layer of depth and comedy that some shows will avoid.  While Scrubs was a great show, it knew very little of what happened outside the hospital.  They brought in guest stars.. but as doctors or patients, rarely, if ever as themselves.Soap Opera writing.  Seinfeld and Scrubs are my favorite examples of soap opera sit coms.  Everyone's story is important and will eventually intersect.  The intersection usually creates a pretty big laugh.  With Seinfeld, they mastered bringing everyone together in very unique and deep ways.  They went outside the box to get events like a golf ball, a beached whale, and a white lie about being a marine biologist together for side splitting laughter.  Scrubs took this mechanic and used it as a way to tell a story and make a meaningful point.  Every episode had a lesson and it was often told by comparing the different cast members situation.  They could make you laugh and cry in the same episode.  The Community does both and in its first season, they do it like a pro.  They also go in other directions that many would think would turn the show upside down.  The gangster chicken strip episode, the paint ball war zone, and the zombie episode all find ways to do the outrageous without ever leaving context.The DVD contains features throughout.  One episode has an extended version that can be seen or you can choose to watch the original.  Every single episode has commentary.  There are deleted scenes, bloopers,  and a mix of featurettes.  Even the DVD casing is setup like a year book and each of the characters has left writing and well wishes over the other characters pictures and episode titles.  I was not expecting much from a first season DVD, but it actually ended up delivering more extras then... well, just about everything out there.We all have our own personal preferences, so its hard to really ""RATE"" a TV show.  But in this case, its quite easy for me to do.  This show gets an A+ in every possible category.  They put so much work into the set, the characters, the writing, the plot, the atmosphere, even the DVD cover, that I have to let them graduate with honors.As with most shows, there is concern about how 8 different college students will still be together 4 years from now.

I am a huge fan of 30 Rock and The Office, even if both shows are losing it a little bit for me. And I am very pleased to have a near perfect fun fresh comedy come bring some freshness to the block. But im going to be completely honest, I hated this show when it first came on. Admittingly I only watched the first episode when it first came but out I flat out didn't like it. I just didn't see anything funny about it. But when i knew that the second season was coming up I put the whole first season on Netflix so i could catch up and BOY AM I GLAD I DID!!!! This is without a DOUBT the best show on NBC's Thursday night line up. Every single moment and every single character on this show is magical. I haven't been so excited about a new show since Glee came out. This show is definitely one of my all time favorite shows now. Im not afraid to say its perfect. There is not a single bad episode, and every one provides non stop witty humor. Also the last minute or two during the end credits with the characters Abed and Troy and hysterical!!!

However, I can strongly recommend Season 1 of Community to anyone who enjoys comedy. The show utilizes a talented cast - not just Joel McHale and Alison Brie, but everyone - for a fun mix of subtle and over-the-top humor. Although it took an episode or two to get up and running, once the writers had a chance to introduce the characters Community's been consistently funny ever since. I laughed more at ""Introduction to Statistics"" and the past several post-Olympics episodes than anything since The Norm Show.Community doesn't merely get the easy jokes right, either; the writers and actors do an impressive job with some fairly subversive jokes about race, sex, etc. On top of all that, Community manages to be an upbeat show, which is a pleasant change of pace from stuff like It's Always Sunny...

1279304,A2DSBRN6SGL6EC,B002N5N5LG,LeeHoFooks,"[0, 0]","""Community"" is a show about a group of loveable misfits who find themselves thrown together in a study group in what must be the world's worst community college. The main character, Jeff Winger, is a lawyer -- or was, until the Bar Association discovered that he had never received a bachelor's degree. He's now trying to get one as quickly, easily, and dishonestly as possible. The rest of the study group he unwittingly finds himself the leader of is made up of the usual community college clich&eacute;s: An old guy who's gone back to school to feel young again, a middle-aged divorced mother, a 20-something slacker, an oddball film student, and a couple of recent high school graduates who blew their senior year (one a top athlete who injured himself doing a keg flip, the other an overachiever who spent the last semester in rehab for her Adderall addiction).The oddball film student is my favorite. His name is Abed, and he's a half Palestinian, half Polish film and TV buff. He's believed to have Asperger's, and can only connect with people through pop culture references. (If you have a gimmick account on the AV Club, or you have ever referred to yourself as ""This Troper,"" you're going to love Abed.)It took me about two or three episodes to really get into the show, but then I finally saw ""Community"" for the hilarious (at times even brilliant) show it is. In fact, I'm surprised it even took me that long. By coincidence, I started attending community college around the same time the series began. (I'm a veteran, recently separated from the military -- the one community college clich&eacute; not represented on the show.) I was sitting in math class one day, when the older guy next to me nudged me and made a crude comment about a teenage girl in the front row. I didn't know whether to laugh or cry.But anyway, personal asides... um... aside, ""Community"" combines wit and warmth in a way not seen since the classic era of ""The Simpsons."" And not since ""The Critic"" have I seen a show that can so seamlessly switch gears back and forth between heartfelt situational ""group of quirky friends"" comedy and hilarious film and TV parody (and sometimes managing both at the same time).Once I caught on to ""Community,"" I was worried that it was too good to be true. I was afraid that it would catch on with the critics, but not the mainstream audience. Shows with high levels of intelligence and heart often don't last (shows like ""The Critic,"" ""Firefly,"" and ""Arrested Development""). Fortunately, it HAS caught on, and ""Community"" will be entering its 3rd season this fall. Unfortunately, now I fear that the show will be ruined in the opposite way -- that it will be dragged on far too long. Just think of how they kept ""MASH"" on the air a few years longer than they should have, what's currently happening to ""The Office,"" and how (sigh...) ""The Simpsons"" has been on for about 13 years (and counting) too long.But hey, let's enjoy it while it lasts/before it jumps the shark!",5,Funniest Show on TV Right Now,1308960000,"06 25, 2011",2011,2992,"['Community', 'show', 'group', 'loveable', 'misfits', 'who', 'find', 'thrown', 'together', 'study', 'group', 'what', 'must', 'be', 'world', 'worst', 'community', 'college', 'main', 'character', 'Jeff', 'Winger', 'lawyer', 'was', 'Bar', 'Association', 'discovered', 'had', 'never', 'received', 'bachelor', 'degree', 'now', 'trying', 'get', 'one', 'quickly', 'easily', 'dishonestly', 'possible', 'rest', 'study', 'group', 'unwittingly', 'leader', 'made', 'usual', 'community', 'college', 'clich', 'eacute', 's', 'old', 'guy', 'who', 'gone', 'back', 'school', 'feel', 'young', 'again', 'middle-aged', 'divorced', 'mother', '20-something', 'slacker', 'oddball', 'film', 'student', 'couple', 'recent', 'high', 'school', 'graduates', 'who', 'blew', 'senior', 'year', 'one', 'top', 'athlete', 'who', 'injured', 'doing', 'keg', 'flip', 'other', 'overachiever', 'who', 'spent', 'last', 'semester', 'rehab', 'Adderall', 'addiction', 'oddball', 'film', 'student', 'favorite', 'name', 'Abed', 'half', 'Palestinian', 'half', 'Polish', 'film', 'TV', 'buff', 'believed', 'have', 'Asperger', 'can', 'only', 'connect', 'people', 'pop', 'culture', 'references', 'have', 'gimmick', 'account', 'AV', 'Club', 'have', 'ever', 'referred', 'Troper', ""'re"", 'going', 'love', 'Abed', 'took', 'two', 'three', 'episodes', 'really', 'get', 'show', 'then', 'finally', 'saw', 'Community', 'hilarious', 'times', 'even', 'brilliant', 'show', 'fact', ""'m"", 'surprised', 'even', 'took', 'long', 'coincidence', 'started', 'attending', 'community', 'college', 'same', 'time', 'series', 'began', ""'m"", 'veteran', 'recently', 'separated', 'military', 'one', 'community', 'college', 'clich', 'eacute', 'not', 'represented', 'show', 'was', 'sitting', 'math', 'class', 'one', 'day', 'when', 'older', 'guy', 'made', 'crude', 'comment', 'teenage', 'girl', 'front', 'row', 'did', ""n't"", 'know', 'laugh', 'cry.But', 'anyway', 'personal', 'asides', 'um', 'aside', 'Community', 'combines', 'wit', 'warmth', 'way', 'not', 'seen', 'classic', 'era', 'Simpsons', 'not', 'Critic', 'have', 'seen', 'show', 'can', 'so', 'seamlessly', 'switch', 'gears', 'back', 'forth', 'heartfelt', 'situational', 'group', 'quirky', 'friends', 'comedy', 'hilarious', 'film', 'TV', 'parody', 'sometimes', 'managing', 'same', 'time', '.Once', 'caught', 'Community', 'was', 'worried', 'was', 'too', 'good', 'be', 'true', 'was', 'afraid', 'would', 'catch', 'critics', 'not', 'mainstream', 'audience', 'high', 'levels', 'intelligence', 'heart', 'often', 'do', ""n't"", 'last', 'shows', 'Critic', 'Firefly', 'Arrested', 'Development', 'Fortunately', 'HAS', 'caught', 'Community', 'will', 'be', 'entering', '3rd', 'season', 'fall', 'Unfortunately', 'now', 'fear', 'show', 'will', 'be', 'ruined', 'opposite', 'way', 'will', 'be', 'dragged', 'far', 'too', 'long', 'Just', 'think', 'how', 'kept', 'MASH', 'air', 'few', 'years', 'longer', 'should', 'have', 'what', 'currently', 'happening', 'Office', 'how', 'sigh', 'Simpsons', 'been', '13', 'years', 'counting', 'too', 'long.But', 'hey', 'let', 'enjoy', 'lasts/before', 'shark']",Community: Season 1

Big Bang Theory, Chuck, Scrubs, Burn Notice, White Collar, ESPN...As you can see I do not watch much TV so when I watch a show, it is good.  As my heading said, Community feels like the illegitimate child of Big Bang Theory and scrubs in college.Synapse:  A group of unlikely community college students find themselves becoming good friends in an attempt to pass senior Changs Spanish class.  Jeff Winger the leader of the group is an ex-lawer trying not to get disbarred and go unnoticed in college while trying to ""get"" the girl.  Britta, jeffs object of affection in the beginning, is a feminist who really hasn't fought for anything.  Pierce (chevy Chase) is a retired business man who thinks going to college will make him young again.  Troy was the former star QB in highschool but after a keg stand injury he is trying to make the grade rather then make the team.  Annie is a secrete admirer of Troy who was known as Aderal Annie in Highschool.  Shirley is the mother of 2 and after a messy divorce is looking for a fresh start in college.  Finally Abed the non terrorist muslim film buff who has aspergers.  He knows everything about nearly every film ever made. This unlikely band finds adventure in their lives through their spanish study group and various chaotic community college events like campus wide paint ball games.Heres the break down:Characters:  The characters are unique, fun and deep.  Each one has something that makes them tick and adds something to the show.  Each episode builds slowly on previous ones in-terms of character development.  The characters are constantly evolving and coming to terms with their surroundings much like ""real people"" do.  Chevy Chases character can be a little annoying but eh, what you going to do its chevy :) 5/5Comedy:  The episodes are slammed full of comedy.  It gives just the right amount of slap stick, situational and comedic antics throughout. 5/5Plot:  Each episode albeit slowly, churns through the academic school year.  Plot lines a sewn deeper as the series progresses with each episode building off the last.  4.5/5Acting:  The acting is very good from most cast.  Their are frequent cameos (much like Scrubs) that doesnt move the story along, but adds to the enjoyment of the experience.  4.5/5replay value:  In my opinion I could watch episodes multiple times and have done so to show others how funny the show is.  5/5Conclusion:If your looking for a funny comedy that if you have ever been to college you might be able to relate to in some way or another.  This is probably the show for you.  If you are truly unsure if you will enjoy it.  Got to NBC.com and watch an episode online.  You wont understand the characters, but will get an idea of how the show will go.",5,Big Bang Theory and Scrubs have a baby in College = Community,1315094400,"09 4, 2011",2011,2845,"['save', 'time', 'here', 'are', 'favorite', 'shows', 'TV', 'last', '3', 'years', 'show', 'what', 'am', 'interested', 'Big', 'Bang', 'Theory', 'Chuck', 'Scrubs', 'Burn', 'Notice', 'White', 'Collar', 'ESPN', 'can', 'see', 'do', 'not', 'watch', 'much', 'TV', 'when', 'watch', 'show', 'good', 'heading', 'said', 'Community', 'illegitimate', 'child', 'Big', 'Bang', 'Theory', 'scrubs', 'college.Synapse', 'group', 'unlikely', 'community', 'college', 'students', 'find', 'becoming', 'good', 'friends', 'attempt', 'pass', 'senior', 'Changs', 'Spanish', 'class', 'Jeff', 'Winger', 'leader', 'group', 'ex-lawer', 'trying', 'not', 'get', 'disbarred', 'go', 'unnoticed', 'college', 'trying', 'get', 'girl', 'Britta', 'jeffs', 'object', 'affection', 'beginning', 'feminist', 'who', 'really', ""n't"", 'fought', 'anything', 'Pierce', 'chevy', 'Chase', 'retired', 'business', 'man', 'who', 'going', 'college', 'will', 'make', 'young', 'again', 'Troy', 'was', 'former', 'star', 'QB', 'highschool', 'keg', 'stand', 'injury', 'trying', 'make', 'grade', 'rather', 'then', 'make', 'team', 'Annie', 'secrete', 'admirer', 'Troy', 'who', 'was', 'known', 'Aderal', 'Annie', 'Highschool', 'Shirley', 'mother', '2', 'messy', 'divorce', 'looking', 'fresh', 'start', 'college', 'Finally', 'Abed', 'non', 'terrorist', 'muslim', 'film', 'buff', 'who', 'aspergers', 'everything', 'nearly', 'film', 'ever', 'made', 'unlikely', 'band', 'adventure', 'lives', 'spanish', 'study', 'group', 'various', 'chaotic', 'community', 'college', 'events', 'campus', 'wide', 'paint', 'ball', 'break', 'down', 'Characters', 'characters', 'are', 'unique', 'fun', 'deep', 'one', 'something', 'tick', 'something', 'show', 'episode', 'slowly', 'previous', 'ones', 'in-terms', 'character', 'development', 'characters', 'are', 'constantly', 'evolving', 'coming', 'terms', 'surroundings', 'much', 'real', 'people', 'do', 'Chevy', 'Chases', 'character', 'can', 'be', 'little', 'annoying', 'eh', 'what', 'going', 'do', 'chevy', '5/5Comedy', 'episodes', 'are', 'slammed', 'full', 'comedy', 'just', 'right', 'amount', 'slap', 'stick', 'situational', 'comedic', 'antics', '5/5Plot', 'episode', 'slowly', 'churns', 'academic', 'school', 'year', 'Plot', 'lines', 'sewn', 'deeper', 'series', 'episode', 'building', 'off', 'last', '4.5/5Acting', 'acting', 'very', 'good', 'most', 'cast', 'are', 'frequent', 'cameos', 'much', 'Scrubs', 'doesnt', 'move', 'story', 'enjoyment', 'experience', '4.5/5replay', 'value', 'opinion', 'could', 'watch', 'episodes', 'multiple', 'times', 'have', 'done', 'so', 'show', 'others', 'how', 'funny', 'show', '5/5Conclusion', 'looking', 'funny', 'comedy', 'have', 'ever', 'been', 'college', 'might', 'be', 'able', 'relate', 'way', 'probably', 'show', 'are', 'truly', 'unsure', 'will', 'enjoy', 'Got', 'NBC.com', 'watch', 'episode', 'online', 'wont', 'understand', 'characters', 'will', 'get', 'idea', 'how', 'show', 'will', 'go']",Community: Season 1

I am a big fan of Donald Glover's music and stand-ups, however as an actor I was a little bit skepticle. I came across the show on-demand not too long ago and I HAVE BEEN HOOKED EVER SINCE. This show is incredible from just about every aspect, the writing is top notch, the humor (while very silly) is neither corny or tries too hard, just about all the characters from the start are loveable, and the setting is very relatable to people around the ages of 18-27 as well as those who attend a community college. Season 1 is a great start, while the first couple of episodes don't exactly capture the characters true personalities just yet, the premise and the interactions between the characters are just laugh out loud all the way through. I guess the shows main theme is DIVERSITY, and how people of different cultures can come together, learn from one another, and befriend one another without succumbing to typical stereotypes. I love how the show incorporates racial satire, silly and sarcastic humor, and very outlandish situations to create such a genuine, fun show. While primarily a comedy show, there are also subtle touching moments that really contain deep moral values to them that it's hard not to love.The DVD itself was great. 4 discs with a great amount of episodes (25 to be exact) with each and every episode accomodated with commentaries. Other extras include various outtakes of essentially every episode which are truly hilarious, some featurettes, alternate and deleted scenes, as well as mini-episodes. I am very impressed with how many extras they jampacked into this DVD. It is great to get a real taste of the creation and process of the show, and lucky for us, there many extras thatare at the consumers disposal. As far as modern television, I would rank this as my new #1 favorite show easily eclipsing The Big Bang Theory. I'm actually not really used to sitcoms that don't use laugh tracks, which can sometimes escalate humor, but also make it generic and annoying when its not a real audience. Community is just one of those shows that don't come around very often that I can personally find enjoyable from every single episode. I am looking forward to watching and purchasing the other seasons and future seasons (hopefully it will not be cancelled due to low ratings) Pick it UP!!!!!P.S.

1279330,A1YDW1CEVP2WX6,B002N5N5LG,Scott Carmichael,"[13, 127]","I picked up Community for $12.99 during the Black Friday craziness and I was super excited to finally get a chance to see this show. As a fan of Chevy Chase (who was sadly ignored for the past 10-15 years) and Joel McHale (hey, who doesn't like Talk Soup [er, ""The Soup""]?), Community seemed to have all the makings of a great sitcom. And based off the glowing reviews from Amazon, I figured this was an easy ""A.""Surprisingly, Community turned out to be very little of what I expected. I expected Chevy Chase to be a goofy professor or something and Joel McHale to be one as well as they dealt with students at a college. Instead, I learn that Joel is a former lawyer who must attend college because he was found to have a phony degree. Okay...still decent, but not what I expected (will come back to this later). Also, we learn Chevy is also a student. Riiiggghhhht...I understand what Community is meant to be. It's meant to be Scrubs-ish show where a variety of characters interact in a setting that has all sorts of events happening around them. In other words, a sitcom in a location where ideas for episodes can come to them (instead of having the characters adapt to new things over time). Problem is, this has been done a million times. In Seinfeld, you had the apartment/diner. In Scrubs, a hospital. In It's Always Sunny, a bar. In Cheers, a bar. In a billion family comedies, a regular house. See where I'm going with this? The only thing that really sets Community apart from any other sitcom is its setting - a school.The characters are all mind-numbingly predictable. Joel is Jeff, a cocky, good-looking, ""too cool for school"" ladies man who never gets shot down. Chevy is Pierce, a stupid and non-PC rich guy who writes checks for $25k...but chose to attend community college. Britta is the misunderstood, feminist hottie. Troy is a not-so-bright kid who is only there to assist with other characters' storylines. Shirley is the token older lady and ""mother figure."" Annie is the ""don't know I'm smokin' hot teehee"" overachiever. Lastly, Abed is the social outcast idiot savant.On paper, the list of characters doesn't seem too bad. Few characters have traits that overlap, so each one serves a purpose when needed. But if you watch even a couple episodes you'll notice something very unsettling: You've seen ALL of these characters in many, many other shows/movies.Jeff: Dennis (It's Always Sunny), Kelso (70s Show), Jake Wyler (Not Another Teen Movie), Charlie (Two and  Half Men), J.D. (Scrubs)Britta: Penny (Big Bang Theory), Elliot (Scrubs), Jenna (30 Rock)Pierce: Frank Reynolds (It's Always Sunny)Shirley: Kitty Forman (70s Show)Annie: Janey Briggs (Not Another Teen Movie), Liz Lemon (30 Rock), Kat (10 Things I Hate About You)Troy: Token Black Guy (Not Another Teen Movie), Turk (Scrubs)Abed: Sheldon (Big Bang Theory)See the problem here? Before you've even had a chance to see the potential of the show, the formulaic characters have already been completely spelled out to you on other, popular, well-known shows.I mean, is it any shocker Jeff & Britta do it? What about Annie eventually ""opening up"" and going after guys that are opposite of her? Or that Pierce manages to stay relevant and have people nearby thanks largely to his wealth? Or how about Abed always having the right answer at any given moment and never really fouling up? It's a shame the creators (and actors) didn't do more to make their characters unique.Next up is the biggest peeve of mine - the setting itself.As you recall, I mentioned Jeff's character lost his ability to practice law because he lied about having a degree. First, not only would it be highly unethical for him to regain his lawyer status even IF he completed a degree (we're going to assume he never got a Bachelor's since he keeps mentioning needing ""4 years"") - afterall - his peers are the ones who have to let him ""back into the lawyer club"" ...it probably wouldn't even work out (no lawyer is gonna help another out in a situation like Jeff's - especially it might potentially make them look bad ethically). I mean, 4 years does not equal 7 years needed to get a Law Degree. And if his B.S. degree was voided, that probably voided out parts (if not all) of his Law School degree as well (meaning he'd have to take that again...if he even took it at all).Next up is the ridiculous idea that you can get a 4-year degree from a community college. True, you can 4+ year degrees from University extension programs in many CCs but state community colleges are called that BECAUSE they don't offer true B.S. degrees. So for Jeff to say (repeatedly) he can get his degree in 4 years at Greendale is downright stupid.Third, let's discuss the school itself. Raise your hands if you've ever set foot on a Community College campus. If you have, you'd know 99% of them look NOTHING like what they show. The school you see on TV is nicer than many State Universities' facilities. And how many CCs keep facilities open 24/7 for students (like the library), have a full biology department (with live animals on campus), a giant, new pool, etc.? Um, close to nil. These are schools that get virtually no special funding and have per credit rates that are generally a 1/3 of what state universities charge. Gimme a break.And in the awful tradition of the American version of 'The Office,' way too often characters participate in oh-so convenient ""Dances"" ""Parties"" and ""Rallies"" on campus to get them out of the study room and make Greendale seem more lively than it really would be. Again, maybe this would happen at a University where thousands of people live on or near campus (at the State University I attended, events happened, sure...but 90+% of students on campus didn't attend them...because they were lame and school sponsored)...but at Community College, so many students are commuters there is rarely anything to do EVER on campus. And FYI - I've been a student at both CC & University levels...there is a night and day difference in all things I mentioned.Fourth, if Jeff is so worried about passing class with the littlest effort possible, WHY IS HE TAKING SPANISH WITH A JERKWAD TEACHER? I think Chang is funny, sure...but as a student, he's the type of teacher I'd drop on day one. Again, makes NO sense.Fifth, you KNEW they'd try to find a way to get more regular Senor Chang in season 2...but the thing is, he was written as a mean, evil teacher that the ""community"" was forced to deal with. So near the end of the season Chang is discovered to have a fake degree and is forced to pull a Jeff by going back to college...at Greendale...in hopes that when he finishes he can go back to what he did before with no penalty (once again, colleges are notoriously picky about who they hire nowadays - why would they re-hire someone who not only lied about their credentials but also didn't teach very well???). Once again, proof that the characters and actors were either miscast or poorly thought out overall. The show should have been about the faculty, not the students.Now you may be saying, ""You are making too much of this! Just enjoy the show Debbie Downer!""....but here's the thing: As I said earlier, Community's only unique factor is that it uses college as a backdrop for the show. But the thing is, for the people who will get the most enjoyment out of this and the folks it's aimed at (people who attend college), the show is insultingly stupid. It just doesn't make sense. If it was a slapstick/Monty Python show or a reset-button show like South Park, I could allow dumb stuff to go on. But in Community, viewers are supposed to believe these are students like you and me, dealing with crazy events that happen around them, on-campus, like you and me.Case in point: Would you have enjoyed Scrubs as much if there was episode after episode involving surgeries and heart transplants at an Urgent Care clinic instead of a hospital? No, because you'd say, THAT MAKES NO SENSE.The show also rips off other TV shows and movies like crazy and since we're all so stupid, Abed continually explains what it is that's being referenced and what everyone is meant to represent. This is either to downplay that Community is blatantly ripping off funny bits from other shows or to explain the jokes for people who wouldn't otherwise get it (if you have to explain it, it isn't funny). In fact, in the episode where students are paintballing everything (real believable) I *knew* they were gonna rip-off the ending of Die Hard. Ya' know Community writers...It's Always Sunny ALREADY DID THAT in a similarly goofy/gun-heavy episode...way back in 2007!In short, the $12.99 I spent on Community seems like $12 too much. I like the cameo actors and I still enjoy seeing Chevy Chase on TV (the ""Human Being"" mascot is easily the most disturbingly hilarious part of the show...although it reeks of 'Green Man' from It's Always Sunny)...but the rest of the show is rather average (at best) and when compared to other shows right now like It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia, South Park and Big Bang Theory (a tad overrated, but still good), Community is clearly a weak comedy series.",2,"When not grading on a curve, ""Community"" is clearly a ""D+"" show.",1291507200,"12 5, 2010",2010,9139,"['picked', 'up', 'Community',

This show follows the exploits of a disbarred lawyer and an unlikely group of friends who are at community college initially only tied together by a Spanish study group. Each story is bold and goofy, with plenty of pop culture references and inside jokes. This show has a cult following for a reason, it is simply fantastic. It has failed to gain audience members because the humor builds on itself to an extant that requires watching the whole series. This set is a way to watch all of the episodes and pick up on humor otherwise passed over, a must for a fan of the series. I normally buy movies and TV shows used, but this series is an exception, I like it so much that I want the sales of DVDs to rise and help make the production more profitable, so I bought it new. I would recommend getting at least the first season to anyone, that way they can see if they like it.

The dean is not used to his full effect and there are some episodes that make you embarrassed for the actors.Still, it's a fine show and a fine season and definitely worth buying. It's just not worth watching several times. 2-3 viewings and you can sell it to a stranger or give it to a friend.

Yeah, every character is a cliche, and no community college is really like this, but that's all just a ruse to make you think it's a generic comedy... but the characters are so much more three-dimensional than the initial viewing implies. Do yourself a favor and go back to Community college for as long as they'll have you.",5,Fantastic Surprise,1301270400,"03 28, 2011",2011,564,"['buying', 'discs', 'had', 'never', 'seen', 'show', 'knew', 'almost', 'nothing', 'Based', 'one', 'recommendation', 'friend', 'above', 'average', 'blurb', 'Entertainment', 'Weekly', 'took', 'chance', 'Best', 'DVD', 'purchase', 'ever', 'love', 'show', 'Yeah', 'character', 'cliche', 'community', 'college', 'really', 'just', 'ruse', 'make', 'think', 'generic', 'comedy', 'characters', 'are', 'so', 'much', 'more', 'three-dimensional', 'initial', 'viewing', 'implies', 'Do', 'favor', 'go', 'back', 'Community', 'college', 'as', 'long', ""'ll"", 'have']",Community: Season 1

Which is saying a lot considering it's only a half hour sitcom. The first season was good, but with the currently airing second season, they have really been consistently phenomenal. I recommend this to everyone with a pulse who has at least a nominal claim to this new-fangled thing called a sense of humor.",5,The reviews are telling the truth.,1301616000,"04 1, 2011",2011,432,"['100', 'reviews', 'almost', '5', 'stars', 'Yeah', 'Community', 'great', 'show', 'possibly', 'one', 'best', 'TV', 'right', 'now', 'Which', 'saying', 'lot', 'considering', 'only', 'half', 'hour', 'sitcom', 'first', 'season', 'was', 'good', 'currently', 'airing', 'second', 'season', 'have', 'really', 'been', 'consistently', 'phenomenal', 'recommend', 'everyone', 'pulse', 'who', 'least', 'nominal', 'claim', 'new-fangled', 'thing', 'called', 'sense', 'humor']",Community: Season 1
