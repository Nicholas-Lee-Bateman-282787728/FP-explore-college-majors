The footage of the space station and vehicles was all taken from ""The Conquest of Space"", but the actors are all original and some well known.

While not ""truly awful,"" as are some lower-end space sagas, a grade ""B"" is on the generous side. It helps to know that this was created as a pilot for a television series ... which was never completed.The movie uses sequences from George Pal's unique flop, Conquest of Space; and obviously, the title ""Destination Space"" is a merger of two Pal movies (Destination Moon and Conquest of Space). Although the technical details are reasonably good for the era (1959), outright goofy sequences are also present. Consider the sequence in which astronauts are towed behind a space tug while holding ropes, and the tug's rocket engine is blasting right at them! There is also a sequence where astronauts jump off from a space ship toward the space station a hundred meters or so away. How are they going to brake their impact? And what if they miss? George Pal was a strong believer in atomic propulsion for space exploration ... which turned out not to be essential ... and in fact has not happened yet.A side plot involves a congressman who questions the utility of the giant-rotating-wheel  space station ... a concept strongly championed by von Braun. In the movie he is the ""wrecker"" threatening the project. In retrospect, it seems the congress man was right ...  the giant space wheel, while nice, is simply too expensive. Perhaps the most interesting part of the movie is the developing love triangle. ... and that says a lot.",3,Mainly for Space Buffs,1367798400,"05 6, 2013",2013,1469,"['movie', 'dyed-in-the-wool', 'space', 'buffs', 'not', 'truly', 'awful', 'are', 'lower-end', 'space', 'sagas', 'grade', 'B', 'generous', 'side', 'know', 'was', 'created', 'pilot', 'television', 'series', 'was', 'never', 'completed.The', 'movie', 'sequences', 'George', 'Pal', 'unique', 'flop', 'Conquest', 'Space', 'obviously', 'title', 'Destination', 'Space', 'merger', 'two', 'Pal', 'movies', 'Destination', 'Moon', 'Conquest', 'Space', 'technical', 'details', 'are', 'reasonably', 'good', 'era', '1959', 'outright', 'goofy', 'sequences', 'are', 'also', 'present', 'Consider', 'sequence', 'astronauts', 'are', 'towed', 'space', 'tug', 'holding', 'ropes', 'tug', 'rocket', 'engine', 'blasting', 'right', 'also', 'sequence', 'where', 'astronauts', 'jump', 'off', 'space', 'ship', 'space', 'station', 'hundred', 'meters', 'so', 'away', 'How', 'are', 'going', 'brake', 'impact', 'what', 'miss', 'George', 'Pal', 'was', 'strong', 'believer', 'atomic', 'propulsion', 'space', 'exploration', 'turned', 'out', 'not', 'be', 'essential', 'fact', 'not', 'happened', 'yet.A', 'side', 'plot', 'congressman', 'who', 'questions', 'utility', 'giant-rotating-wheel', 'space', 'station', 'concept', 'strongly', 'championed', 'von', 'Braun', 'movie', 'wrecker', 'threatening', 'project', 'retrospect', 'congress', 'man', 'was', 'right', 'giant', 'space', 'wheel', 'nice', 'simply', 'too', 'expensive', 'Perhaps', 'most', 'interesting', 'part', 'movie', 'developing', 'love', 'triangle', 'lot']",Destination Space
