There is so much to be appreciated in terms of the work, dedication and emotion that accompanies one's effort to succeed as a professional ballerina, and this DVD goes a long way toward conveying all these things to the viewer.Katja Bjorner is the focal point of this documentary, as she can be seen practicing (so hard!) to get into form prior to a performance of Swan Lake by the Royal Swedish Ballet.  Many of us know of the countless hours of physical duress involved in preparing to become a dancer with a national dance company.  In this film we see in her face, her feet, and practically every one of her muscles, how Ms. Bjorner strains to hardwire the beauty and grace of the dance into her body.What I really liked about this film is that, rather than straight narration, some behind the scenes dialogue is brought out nicely through friendly chats with famous Swedish actor Erland Josephson, who may be playing the part of interviewer, but who seems truly intrigued and curious about many aspects of Ms. Bjorner's aspirations and stage persona.  He poses questions, and she takes care to describe all the elements and dance roles she needs to master in auditioning for the big show.  The documentary generally rotates through instruction, conversation, classes (boys and girls) and performance.  Check out the SLOPED dance floor in the ballet school, which is noted during conversation by Mr. Josephson.  The numerous scenes filmed in dance classes feature noteworthy ballet masters Valentina Savina, Michael Messerer and Aleksander Khmelnitski.  [Listen to Ms. Savina switching between Russian, Spanish and English during her classes!  FYI, no subtitles during the classroom scenes; they aren't needed].There is also a VERY interesting segment which is filmed in the factory of Freed of London, perhaps the world's foremost designer/maker of ballet shoes.  Here we gain insight into the intense labor and skill involved in making ballet shoes; see how meticulous are the ballerinas in working with the designers to fashion a shoe that is perfect for the girls' foot shape, weight distribution, and balance.  It's great work . . . on both sides of the camera.The final chapter is captivating, with footage alternating between Ms. Bjorner's on-stage performance, and her after-the-show animated account of what she was sensing when the spotlight was on her dancing.  Then Ms. Savina comes backstage and gushes some well deserved praise.Get this, you'll like it.",5,"Awesome ""behind the scenes"" dance documentary",1180915200,"06 4, 2007",2007,2587,"['would', 'recommend', 'Dancer', 'Dansaren', 'Swedish', 'anyone', 'interested', 'dance', 'kind', 'not', 'just', 'ballet', 'so', 'much', 'be', 'appreciated', 'terms', 'work', 'dedication', 'emotion', 'one', 'effort', 'succeed', 'professional', 'ballerina', 'DVD', 'long', 'way', 'conveying', 'things', 'viewer.Katja', 'Bjorner', 'focal', 'point', 'documentary', 'can', 'be', 'seen', 'practicing', 'so', 'hard', 'get', 'form', 'prior', 'performance', 'Swan', 'Lake', 'Royal', 'Swedish', 'Ballet', 'Many', 'know', 'countless', 'hours', 'physical', 'duress', 'involved', 'preparing', 'become', 'dancer', 'national', 'dance', 'company', 'film', 'see', 'face', 'feet', 'practically', 'one', 'muscles', 'how', 'Ms.', 'Bjorner', 'hardwire', 'beauty', 'grace', 'dance', 'body.What', 'really', 'liked', 'film', 'rather', 'straight', 'narration', 'scenes', 'dialogue', 'brought', 'out', 'nicely', 'friendly', 'chats', 'famous', 'Swedish', 'actor', 'Erland', 'Josephson', 'who', 'may', 'be', 'playing', 'part', 'interviewer', 'who', 'truly', 'intrigued', 'curious', 'many', 'aspects', 'Ms.', 'Bjorner', 'aspirations', 'stage', 'persona', 'questions', 'care', 'describe', 'elements', 'dance', 'roles', 'master', 'auditioning', 'big', 'show', 'documentary', 'generally', 'instruction', 'conversation', 'classes', 'boys', 'girls', 'performance', 'Check', 'SLOPED', 'dance', 'floor', 'ballet', 'school', 'noted', 'conversation', 'Mr.', 'Josephson', 'numerous', 'scenes', 'filmed', 'dance', 'classes', 'feature', 'noteworthy', 'ballet', 'masters', 'Valentina', 'Savina', 'Michael', 'Messerer', 'Aleksander', 'Khmelnitski', '[', 'Listen', 'Ms.', 'Savina', 'switching', 'Russian', 'Spanish', 'English', 'classes', 'FYI', 'subtitles', 'classroom', 'scenes', 'are', ""n't"", 'needed', ']', 'also', 'VERY', 'interesting', 'segment', 'filmed', 'factory', 'Freed', 'London', 'perhaps', 'world', 'foremost', 'designer/maker', 'ballet', 'shoes', 'Here', 'gain', 'insight', 'intense', 'labor', 'skill', 'involved', 'making', 'ballet', 'shoes', 'see', 'how', 'meticulous', 'are', 'ballerinas', 'working', 'designers', 'fashion', 'shoe', 'perfect', 'girls', 'foot', 'shape', 'weight', 'distribution', 'balance', 'great', 'work', 'sides', 'camera.The', 'final', 'chapter', 'captivating', 'footage', 'alternating', 'Ms.', 'Bjorner', 'on-stage', 'performance', 'after-the-show', 'animated', 'account', 'what', 'was', 'sensing', 'when', 'spotlight', 'was', 'dancing', 'Then', 'Ms.', 'Savina', 'backstage', 'well', 'deserved', 'praise.Get', ""'ll"", 'like']",N/A
