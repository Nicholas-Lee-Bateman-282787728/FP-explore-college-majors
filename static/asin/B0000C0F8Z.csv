Now they are given a budget and start to get serious with the addition of a bigger budget and a more defined plot that they started at the end of season one.  Plus they added a new regular character and each member of the crew has their own agenda that they start to explore.Crichton has information in his head he wasn't aware of, now Scorpius is dead set on finding him.  An enigmatic creature that is a deadly adversary.  About all that is revealed about him in season 1 is that he is a high ranking member of the Peacekeepers, which in itself is odd.  The Peacekeepers are a group of totalitarian fanatics and believe in the purity of their species.  You find out that he is crossbred with a species that is considered the biggest threat to the Peackeepers.  John is justly terrified of him as he will do anything to achieve his goals and has horrid memories of the Aurora Chair.D'argo is searching for his son and revenge.  He had a child with a Sebacian, something they frown on, and his wife was murdered by her brother for it, he was placed with the blame.Chiana is escaping her people, a group that believes in enforcing appropriate behavoir through mind cleansing.  Why they are so interested in her is the question.Aeryn shows how unstable she is emotionally.  She has never dealt with emotions before always relying on duty.  She is an outcast from her people and no longer has her duty to rely on.Moya's child Talyn shows to be more than they expected and forms an unusual bond with the recently outcast Crais, who becomes the ships advisor.Some of the best episodes are as follows.Taking the Stone:  Chiana discovers the &quot;lost children&quot;, except they are a strange group that pops mushrooms and drinks all the time.  They also have a strange ritual called taking the stone, that makes certain they never get &quot;worn out&quot;.Crackers Don't Matter: They pick up a strange alien that offers to help them.  But they all start acting strangely and get increasingly paranoid.Out of Their Minds:  Funny episode where bodies are swapped.A Look at the Princess 1-3:  This was my personal favorite.  A breakaway sebacian colony that is a monarchy, ruled by an empiress.  They visit during coronation where people kiss with a special fluid that tells if they are genetically compatible to have healthy children.  All goes well until Chriton kisses the princess and next in line to the throne and finds he is the only male compatible with her, and is pulled into a power struggle.Liars Guns and Money 1-3:  Aptly named, the crew finds where D'argo's sun is and resort to thievery, hiring mercenaries from past episodes, and use outright force to get him back.  Nothing seems to go right and they have some great sets and bring back some characters from past episodes.Die Me Dichtomy:  They find that something was put in John that can control him to a degree.  They find someone that can help him, but not before a member of the crew is killed.

771843,A354HH188OAJUU,B0000C0F8Z,Anna-P,"[7, 9]","Spoiler-Free ReviewsFarscape's first season offered a show full of promise. The look, sharp dialog delivered by a cast that was dead-on, complicated often adversarial relationships, were refreshing and intriguing. The balance of darkness and humor, action and character interaction, with a generous helping of irreverence and attitude, all made it stand out.The second season builds on that and eases the show further from the pack.  Farscape takes major risks with its characters and storylines and I love that about this show.  I think it ""dares greatly"" and as a result, even the occasional misses are done with flair and originality!  If you value that in your entertainment (as well as your life!), Farscape might be right up your alley.My picks for season highlights:  wickedly edged ""Crackers Don't Matter"" pits a paranoid crew against each other; ""The Way We Weren't"" is an emotionally searing look into the dark corners of two main characters; ""Out Of Their Minds"" lightens up with a storyline that's familiar, but I haven't seen it done better. The cast's portrayals of each others personality quirks was priceless; ""Liars, Guns, and Money"" was a three-part action roller coaster where everything goes...well, the way it usually goes for these guys;  and rarely has a main character been stranded so far up a creek as in ""Die Me, Dichotomy"".For me, all these elements and more add up to a rare treat worth my time to watch, worth my money to buy (I own all four seasons and am waiting for ""Peacekeeper Wars), and worth my five-star recommendation!",5,It Just Keeps Getting Better.....!,1100995200,"11 21, 2004",2004,1557,"['Spoiler-Free', 'ReviewsFarscape', 'first', 'season', 'offered', 'show', 'full', 'promise', 'look', 'sharp', 'dialog', 'delivered', 'cast', 'was', 'dead-on', 'complicated', 'often', 'adversarial', 'relationships', 'were', 'refreshing', 'intriguing', 'balance', 'darkness', 'humor', 'action', 'character', 'interaction', 'generous', 'helping', 'irreverence', 'attitude', 'made', 'stand', 'out.The', 'second', 'season', 'builds', 'show', 'further', 'pack', 'Farscape', 'major', 'risks', 'characters', 'storylines', 'love', 'show', 'think', 'greatly', 'result', 'even', 'occasional', 'misses', 'are', 'done', 'flair', 'originality', 'value', 'entertainment', 'as', 'well', 'life', 'Farscape', 'might', 'be', 'right', 'alley.My', 'picks', 'season', 'highlights', 'wickedly', 'edged', 'Crackers', 'Do', ""n't"", 'Matter', 'paranoid', 'crew', 'other', 'Way', 'Were', ""n't"", 'emotionally', 'searing', 'look', 'dark', 'corners', 'two', 'main', 'characters', 'Their', 'Minds', 'up', 'storyline', 'familiar', 'have', ""n't"", 'seen', 'done', 'better', 'cast', 'portrayals', 'others', 'personality', 'quirks', 'was', 'priceless', 'Liars', 'Guns', 'Money', 'was', 'three-part', 'action', 'roller', 'coaster', 'where', 'everything', 'well', 'way', 'usually', 'guys', 'rarely', 'main', 'character', 'been', 'stranded', 'so', 'far', 'up', 'creek', 'Die', 'Me', 'Dichotomy', 'elements', 'more', 'add', 'up', 'rare', 'treat', 'time', 'watch', 'worth', 'money', 'buy', 'own', 'four', 'seasons', 'am', 'waiting', 'Peacekeeper', 'Wars', 'worth', 'five-star', 'recommendation']",N/A

Descriptions don't match the actual episodes, at all, for Episode 10 and following, and the Episodes themselves are out of order. Episode 9 should be followed by 11, then 13, THEN by #10, then by #16, then by #15, then #14's mislabelled 'Beware of Dog' (which is really the Three Crichtons). #15 matches #14's description, but its actual content follows #16.It keeps on being out of order.  #17 seemingly follows, but its proper description is listed in #16's.  So really it's #17, when Stark comes back, when Moya is caught in a timewarp.  #18 is next, but its content matches the description for #17, but Stark dies in that episode.  Then, #19, which matches the description for #18.  Then, #20, whose content matches #19's description, so #21's content fits #20's description.  Then, #12's content matches #21's description, which suggests that a transposition of episode number, caused this mixup.  So #22, is what it claims to be.  Finally.What a mess: by the time you figure out what happens, you no longer care.  Surprise, surprise, Season 3 is out of order, too.  Some of the episodes seem to belong to Season 2 (Aeyrn's alive again).  Okay, so I'm stopping the review here.  No point watching what's supposed to be Season 3 and 4.Golly, I hope the DVD version is not as out of order;  I sent Amazon a complaint to redo the Amazon Instant Video descriptions, to match the DVD.  In any event, whole series is worth watching only if you're cleaning your email or something else at the same time. There's no suspense, but there is occasional satire or humor.  Canned episodes, every time.Why so bad?  Primarily, due to something in movie or TV making called 'continuity', the 'flow' of events so that the plot makes sense.  This series completely fails at 'continuity'.  It is so disjunctive, as to be jarring.  No chemistry between the characters, wooden script, cheesy special effects (which in sci-fi is desirable, but here they don't work), and no decent long-term plotline.The actors make the best of what they have.  Henson should stick to his Muppets.  He's trying to amalgamate Blake's 7 and Dr. Who, with nods to Buck Rodgers of the 25th Century, but does a bad job of amalgamation.  No charm.  Not fair to the actors, to have such sorry scripts with aimless plots and NO continuity.  Fire the editor.The Puppets are good, though.

The twenty two episodes ranged from very good (The Way We Weren't; Liars, Guns and Money) to hopelessly confusing (Taking the Stone) to outright bad (Out of Their Minds).The Second Season became much more character driven than the first and a great deal of backstory was presented as nearly each main character had his or her stand alone episode. The special effects and makeup created by the Jim Henson Creature Shop were good enough for a feature film and the production design was uniformly excellent.One may then question my three star rating. There are just too many plot holes here. The series moves along in fits and starts. As soon as a good story arc begins to develop the show switches directions. Hopefully this will be straightened out as the third season begins.The discs are pretty standard affairs with two episodes  per disc except for the two trilogy episodes (Look at the  Princess and Liars, Guns and Money). The picture quality is good and the sound field is excellent for a now 10 year old television show. If there is a problem it is that ADV films is still lacking in good bonus features.

Secousu (sorry about the spelling), very hot.  Jool, made me drool, and of course Zahn, wow, what can I say.

Brian Henson and his pals got together and allowed the actors to explore the characters and this is what resulted.The bad guys and girls are totally vicious and malevolent.

The acting is at times cringe-worthy, even worse than the old Star Treks. However, what really undermines the show for me is the pacing. Especially during the first season, it's really slow. The pacing and editing drag the story down rather than give it energy. I found myself getting distracted while watching the show.The dialogue is pretty straightforward - with a few exceptions, nothing memorable or witty. D'argo is like a Klingon, but without the rich cultural layers and energy. Zhaan is sometimes interesting, sometimes boring. Crichton is a bit too much the &#34;all-American&#34; with goofy references to pop culture. Aeryn Sun's character had potential as a former soldier adjusting to life amongst the crew. But so far I haven't fallen in love with any of the characters. There's no Data or Worf from TNG.That said, I have to admit the special effects are pretty good. The show uses muppets and makeups to create a much more bizarre world than anything found in Star Trek.I tried Farscape because of all of the positive reviews.

I dropped in during the middle section of the series and thought it was a bit too much on the psycho-sexual side of things for me. But I did watch most of the last season and the Peace Keeper Wars (which was great, too - nice epilogue).I decided to buy the whole series, part of which was out of print. So it was a bit expensive (and now it's nice to see a reissue for the whole series under a hundred bucks). Nevertheless, I plunged in.Watching the series from the very beginning, taking about two months to do so (purchasing each season as I could find them at reasonable prices, often only in used condition), I began to see what made this series so good.While it did seem to bog down in the third season, as though it had lost its way a bit, overall, it recovered and continued the story arc to its inevitable conclusion in The Peace Keeper Wars (necessary to have 'closure' to the story).I'm glad this only lasted four seasons. It didn't become a tedious boor as a result. The story arc had to progress as a result, giving us some quite compelling story telling and overall good acting throughout the whole series (with a few exceptions).It is the same with Battlestar Galactica, the new series, not too long...just right. Story writers today forget the old axiom: leave them wanting more, not wishing it would end already!If you are a fan of science fiction with higher quality imagery and fully developed characters, good dialogue (most of the time), and a willingness to poke fun at itself, keeping from getting tooo serious at times, this is a good series to get.

771891,A6X6LNZO1C3EZ,B0000C0F8Z,J. Munyon,"[1, 2]","I think I know why Farscape was cancelled off of TV.  I felt like I must have had a bad mind trip when I started season 2 because I was definitely lost.  I have bought and viewed the entire series and the feature length movie, so I'll watch it again and again and again don't get me wrong.  But what happened to Pa'u Zotoh Zhaan?  How did Officer Aeryn Sun come back from the dead?  Why didn't they add Chiana a lot earlier?  Why make Stark such a weiner?  Characters come and go, little is told about them, it takes over a dozen episodes to figure out half of their special abilities, and the series is disjointed enough to make even a hard core fan of Sci-Fi/Fantasy have a tough time following who is on which side and several characters are underdeveloped.  Somebody said the series takes off slow and then zooms along later into the subsequent seasons.  There was a shifting of story between season 1 and season 2 that left me wondering if I ordered the wrong set of DVD's because it seemed like some episodes must have been left out.  I got onto the Internet and researched it in fact, finding the episode lists for each season just to verify I hadn't been short-sheeted.  There are two types of sets for the Farscape DVD's.  This type is the one where you have individual plastic cases for each DVD and the season box holding all the cases takes up quite a bit of space on your collection shelf.  The other type is where there are 5 or 6 DVD's in a single case, that is engineered to hold all of the DVD's in a single plastic case that is the same approximate thickness (thin) as if there were only 1 DVD in the case.  I bought season 2 in the larger style set with all the individual cases and the cardboard season box they all go into.  It was cheaper at the time.  The other three seasons I bought the slim pack that holds all the DVD's in a single case.  By now you're wondering if I regret buying this season in this style of set.  It isn't the packaging's fault.  It was the ham-handed way my mind was toyed with by the writers of the series and made to wonder what I had missed, made me wonder if I didn't get all the episodes, and it is up to the taste of the buyer which style of set you get - the head trip is the same.  It took me quite a while to get over the bump in the series between season 1 and season 2.  I definitely wouldn't have traded the old short woman playing the character with the huge ears and witch looking hair for the character of Zhaan.  But apparently I don't know why Virginia Hey was dropped from the series and need to just not care.  I was working two jobs and going to school when this was on TV, so I'm happy I finally get to see Farscape.  I'd recommend this DVD.  All my whining and complaining notwithstanding, I'm a huge fan, and understand why Claudia Black made it into Stargate SG-1.  Ben Browder is definitely larger than life, and you have to accept a lot on faith about a guy who can be no older than his character and still have developed the skills and savvy to be able to survive in such a hostile environment.  I just wish the series had an easier gallop for me to follow, I got saddle bruises trying to keep up.  Still, two thumbs up.  Way up.  The special features are quite a bit different between this style of packaging and the slim packs.  Seems like more extras in the multiple individual cases boxed set style, but I still prefer the slim packs.",5,choppy and hard to follow - even for an avid fan,1264982400,"02 1, 2010",2010,3413,"['think', 'know', 'why', 'Farscape', 'was', 'cancelled', 'off', 'TV', 'felt', 'must', 'have', 'had', 'bad', 'mind', 'trip', 'when', 'started', 'season', '2', 'was', 'definitely', 'lost', 'have', 'bought', 'viewed', 'entire', 'series', 'feature', 'length', 'movie', 'so', ""'ll"", 'watch', 'again', 'again', 'again', 'do', ""n't"", 'get', 'wrong', 'what', 'happened', 'Pa', 'u', 'Zotoh', 'Zhaan', 'How', 'did', 'Officer', 'Aeryn', 'Sun', 'come', 'back', 'dead', 'Why', 'did', ""n't"", 'add', 'Chiana', 'lot', 'earlier', 'Why', 'make', 'Stark', 'weiner', 'Characters', 'come', 'go', 'little', 'told', 'dozen', 'episodes', 'figure', 'out', 'half', 'special', 'abilities', 'series', 'disjointed', 'enough', 'make', 'even', 'hard', 'core', 'fan', 'Sci-Fi/Fantasy', 'have', 'tough', 'time', 'following', 'who', 'side', 'several', 'characters', 'are', 'underdeveloped', 'Somebody', 'said', 'series', 'slow', 'then', 'zooms', 'later', 'subsequent', 'seasons', 'was', 'shifting', 'story', 'season', '1', 'season', '2', 'left', 'wondering', 'ordered', 'wrong', 'set', 'DVD', 'seemed', 'episodes', 'must', 'have', 'been', 'left', 'out', 'got', 'Internet', 'researched', 'fact', 'finding', 'episode', 'lists', 'season', 'just', 'verify', 'had', ""n't"", 'been', 'short-sheeted', 'are', 'two', 'types', 'sets', 'Farscape', 'DVD', 'type', 'one', 'where', 'have', 'individual', 'plastic', 'cases', 'DVD', 'season', 'box', 'holding', 'cases', 'up', 'quite', 'bit', 'space', 'collection', 'shelf', 'other', 'type', 'where', 'are', '5', '6', 'DVD', 'single', 'case', 'engineered', 'hold', 'DVD', 'single', 'plastic', 'case', 'same', 'approximate', 'thickness', 'thin', 'were', 'only', '1', 'DVD', 'case', 'bought', 'season', '2', 'larger', 'style', 'set', 'individual', 'cases', 'cardboard', 'season', 'box', 'go', 'was', 'cheaper', 'time', 'other', 'three', 'seasons', 'bought', 'slim', 'pack', 'DVD', 'single', 'case', 'now', ""'re"", 'wondering', 'regret', 'buying', 'season', 'style', 'set', ""n't"", 'packaging', 'fault', 'was', 'ham-handed', 'way', 'mind', 'was', 'toyed', 'writers', 'series', 'made', 'wonder', 'what', 'had', 'missed', 'made', 'wonder', 'did', ""n't"", 'get', 'episodes', 'taste', 'buyer', 'style', 'set', 'get', 'head', 'trip', 'same', 'took', 'quite', 'while', 'get', 'bump', 'series', 'season', '1', 'season', '2', 'definitely', 'would', ""n't"", 'have', 'traded', 'old', 'short', 'woman', 'playing', 'character', 'huge', 'ears', 'witch', 'looking', 'hair', 'character', 'Zhaan', 'apparently', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'why', 'Virginia', 'Hey', 'was', 'dropped', 'series', 'need', 'just', 'not', 'care', 'was', 'working', 'two', 'jobs', 'going', 'school', 'when', 'was', 'TV', ""'m"", 'happy', 'finally', 'get', 'see', 'Farscape', ""'d"", 'recommend', 'DVD', 'whining', 'complaining', 'notwithstanding', ""'m"", 'huge', 'fan', 'understand', 'why', 'Claudia', 'Black', 'made', 'Stargate', 'SG-1', 'Ben', 'Browder', 'definitely', 'larger', 'life', 'have', 'accept', 'lot', 'faith', 'guy', 'who', 'can', 'be', 'older', 'character', 'still', 'have', 'developed', 'skills', 'savvy', 'be', 'able', 'survive', 'such', 'hostile', 'environment', 'just', 'wish', 'series', 'had', 'easier', 'gallop', 'follow', 'got', 'saddle', 'bruises', 'trying', 'keep', 'up', 'Still', 'two', 'thumbs', 'up', 'Way', 'up', 'special', 'features', 'are', 'quite', 'bit', 'different', 'style', 'packaging', 'slim', 'packs', 'more', 'extras', 'multiple', 'individual', 'cases', 'boxed', 'set', 'style', 'still', 'prefer', 'slim', 'packs']",N/A

The final moment before he completely loses comtrol of himself is one of the best scenes in the entire series' run, and the season finale is nothing short of phenomenal.This season also focused on John making serious friendships with the people he has been with the past year or so of his life. In the first season they thought of him as an outcast, but finally realized in season two that he is much more. He himself holds the key to one of the galaxies major sources of power -- and destruction -- wormholes. Something hidden inside of his brain that he finally doesn't get to until season four, just about when he becomes drunk with invicibilty becuase of it.I would recommend this DVD to anyone interested in the show.

Smith ""D.Smith""","[0, 0]","So now I am through season 2 (ok i had to start season 3 right away because I am HOOKED) and I am once again blown away for two reasons. One the depth of the story is told and acted so brilliantly I actually find myself caring about the characters, rooting for them win they are winning, and sympathizing with them when they are loosing. I have always enjoyed SCI-FI, but never to this extent. This show had me hooked after a few episodes in Season 1, and as a result I now purchased all other complete seasons, along with PK Wars. So that I do not have to wait to see what happens next. To all who saw this show when it originally aired those must have been some rough months waiting to see what happens next.The actors add so much to these well concieved and written characters that I am overwhelmed watching them. The chemistry between Aeryn and John is utterly amazing. The complete cast make up a true family, you will see parts of your group of family and friends in each of them. They are in a fight for their life and they deal with that in a much more realistic feeling that so many other movies and TV shows do. The romantic story is Shakespearean, and I am drawn in by how realistic it seems. The overall story is told so well that each charcter is not a puppet or in costume, but this feels like their true self.Once again Shame on SCI-FI for simply letting fans down without more. It learned from this mistake as you know see with SG1 and Atlantis, they simply moved it shows to direct to DVD movies. How many more adventures could we have taken with Farscape if they moved this way, who knows??? I for one will once again wish upon a frelling star and hope that one more go around with as much of the original cast could come true",5,This show is amazing!!!!

To say that the crew of the living ship Moya has their hands full is saying it lightly: Crichton (Ben Browder) possesses knowledge he didn't even know he had that the nefarious Scorpius (Wayne Pygram) will stop at nothing to get.  Aeryn (Claudia Black) has some emotional revelations, Zhann (Virginia Hey) isn't being quite herself, Rygel is, well, being Rygel, while Dargo (Anthony Simcoe) is searching for his prisoner son, Chiana (Gigi Edgley) is running from her past, and Crais (Lani John Tupu) forms an unlikely bond with Moya's offspring Talyn.  It's rare that the second season of a show improves on what was already something that was nothing short of excellent, but Farscape manages to pull it off, solidifying it's reputation as one of the absolute best sci-fi dramas to ever hit the small screen.  The characters have been more developed than before, with a blooming romance thrown in for good measure.  The season finale, in which a beloved character makes the ultimate sacrifice, culminates in one of the most jaw dropping cliffhangers ever to be seen on television.

771921,A4FX5YCJA630V,B0000C0F8Z,"R. M. Fisher ""Ravenya""","[1, 1]","Out of Farscape's four seasons (and one mini-series) I would have to say that its second season is probably my least favorite. Without the joy of discovery that thefirst seriesoffered, and without the strong story-arcs of the final two, the second season is certainly not bad, just a tad uneven.The first season ended with the crew of Moya celebrating the birth of their sentient ship's son Talyn, only to find that the Peacekeepers genetically meddled with his conception in order to make him an organic warship, with no need for a mediating Pilot. Their attempt to destroy a Peacekeeper base has split up the crew, and Aeryn has been forced to make a secret alliance with their enemy Crais, the Peacekeeper commander who spent most of last season relentlessly pursuing them. Now a renegade, Crais has realized that his survival now rests with his enemies - and with Talyn.Once reunited, Moya's crew continues their dogged pursuit for survival and their home-planets. Astronaut John Crichton (Ben Browser) is grappling with newfound worm-hole technology implanted in his brain that could be the key to returning to Earth, whilst Luxan warrior D'Argo (Anthony Simcoe) finds new clues as to the location of his son Jothee. Mystical-priestess Zhaan (Virginia Hey) struggles with her mastery over inner peace, and dispossessed Dominar Rygel (voice of Jonathan Hardy) continues to fray the nerves of his crewmates with his plots and schemes. Promiscuous thief Chiana (Gigi Edgley) gets some tragic news about her brother, and Aeryn Sun (Claudia Black) - an ex-peacekeeper and the only crew member who has no home or family to return to - has some past secrets exposed.Also worth keeping an eye on is Stark (Paul Goddard) a half-masked mentally disturbed slave and reoccuring character who veers between painfully sympathetic and incredibly annoying, and Scorpias (Wayne Pygram) a half-Sebacean, half-Scarran Peacekeeper commander who is surely one of the greatest on-screen villains of all time (to my mind, he calls to mind the manipulative genius ofAzulaorBen Linus, and the visual horror ofNosferatuorDarth Vader).Season Two's task is to take the plot-lines and characterization of the first season and build upon them. By this stage each character's rudimentary history has been revealed, and now the development of their characters can begin in earnest. It's fascinating to look back in hindsight and see just how much they've grown and changed over the course of four seasons and a mini-series. Not only do we learn more about them, but also their relationships with one another, sometimes sweet, sometimes adversarial. Watching them begin to work as an effective and powerful team is one of the most rewarding aspects of the show, and it's no surprise that the crew of Moya is beginning to garner a reputation for themselves throughout the galaxy. More than escaped convicts thrown together, they are more like a family now - a very dysfunctional one, but a family nonetheless.There are twenty-two episodes in all, and the quality is a bit of a mixed bag. Though they are certainly helped along by the audience's familiarity and fondness for the characters, there are plenty of duds mixed in with the stronger multi-episode arcs. Several episodes follow the usual sci-fi clich&eacute;s: there's the one in which the crewmembers all switch bodies, and the one where they're on trial for a crime they didn't commit. There's theRashomon-style episode, in which an event is described from various points of view, and the one where a crew member is divided into several personalities.(Out of interest, the first episode of season two was actually supposed to be ""Dream a Little Dream,"" instead of ""Mind the Baby."" The network objected, believing that an audience would want immediate closure on the cliff-hanger of the first season finale, and ""Dream a Little Dream"" is instead presented much later in the season, as a flashback episode. Those who have the power of DVD may be interested in watching it first, as the writers originally intended.)But at times the writers take risks, and when they begin to lay the foundations for the long-term story arcs that drive the entire show, ""Farscape"" becomes a fully-fledged space opera. Although the three-part ""Kiss the Princess"" trilogy is so convoluted that it's virtually indecipherable, the Western-style bank heist of the ""Liars, Guns and Money"" trilogy is great fun; complex without getting confusing. The poignant ""The Locket"" provides plenty of ship-tease for the growing attraction between Crichton and Aeryn, and ""Die Me, Dichotomy"" is a riveting season finale in which Crichton attempts to be rid of the ""neural clone"" that Scorpias has implanted in his head in the attempt to access the wormhole technology.Along with setting up the plot-points concerning Scorpias's agenda, Talyn's personality, John's implant and Aeryn's sacrifice that will be pushed further in the third series, season two also introduces the Scarrans (which are another important alien race) and the Nebari (which aren't).There is always something to be said for the incredible beauty of ""Farscape."" Using Jim Henson puppetry, extensive prosthetics and makeup, as well as meticulous sets, costumes and character design, this is one of the most colorful and beautiful shows on television. Much fuss is made over CGI these days, but I personally (being a child of the 1980s) infinitely prefer a realistic muppet over bad computer graphics. However, when ""Farscape"" does fall back on computers to create its visuals, they hold up surprisingly well by today's standards.As I said at the beginning of the review, season two of ""Farscape"" is not my favorite, but it's a strong continuation of the first season's setup, and a fitting herald for the brilliancy of season three. With emotions running high, stories becoming more intricately plotted, and the audience's investment in the characters growing ever-deeper, season two of ""Farscape"" is an essential part of any collection.",4,"""We've Reached the End of the Old, the Beginning of the New...""",1284681600,"09 17, 2010",2010,6000,"['Farscape', 'four', 'seasons', 'one', 'mini-series', 'would', 'have', 'say',

After finishing the season one cliffhanger when nearly everyone was left for dead the show continues with some very good and some excellent episodes in season 2.About the boxed setThe set contains all 22 season two episodes divided in 5 sets of DVD's containing 4 or 5 episodes each. Some DVD's contain bonus features but these are merely comments and brief promotional videos and are a bit disappointing.The DVD's have a nice layout but a bit annoying is a wormhole sequence which is played at absurdly loud sound level everytime you select an episode.The set is nicely packaged but the quality of the package remains questionable since it is made out of paper. I own the season 1 and 2 and for now the package is not damaged but we will see about that when the show gets in the hands of some of my friends.About the showThe story is about a pilot named John Chricton which during an experimental flight gets sucked in the wormhole and ends up on the other end of the galaxy. There he stumbles in the middle of a prison break and ends up with the escaped criminals on a living ship called Moya.In the second season we see further development in character relations between the crew. Some fight and tensions as no one gets along all that well. We see some romances develop and some deals get broken. Nobody is completely without flaws but somehow they all pull together in tough spots and get through them.My favorite episodes in second season are &quot;The way we weren't&quot; where we learn a little bit about Aeryn's and pilot's past and &quot;Won't get fooled again&quot; where Crichton wakes up on earth again. There is an excellent three part episode called &quot;Liars, Guns and Money&quot; when the crew of Moya decides to rob a bank to get enough money to buy D'argo's sun from slave traders.The best episode must be &quot;Die Me, Dichotomy&quot; which is the last in the season but I won't spoil it for you.Quality an conclusionThe picture quality is very good as the show is presented in 16:9 wide screen. The sound and special effect remain to be top notch. The creature and prosthetics keep getting better and more elaborate. If you loved the first season you'll love the second even more.

Am I the only one confused by all those volumes? This is the way it should be seen and bought. I have been watching the reruns of this show and I am now up to season 4. Looking back on Season two their are plenty of great high light episodes that come to mind. This is where Johns obsession with worm holes really starts to grow. It's also when he gets the scorpious chip put inside his head. This season has the best cliff hanger of the first three seasons, I have yet to see how season 4 ends.It's interesting to note that ""Dream a little dream"" was the original first episode. But SciFi thought it did not address the issues of the cliff hanger of season 1 so instead it began with ""Mind the Baby"". This season starts off pretty rocky as ""Dream a little dream"" and ""Taking the Stone"" are pretty weak episodes. It always takes a few episodes for a farscape season to get warmed up. But once your in you are treated to such great episodes as;""The Way, We weren't"": Great background story on Pilot, Moya, and Aeryn,""My Three Crichtons"": Great acting by Ben Browder as he plays three versions of himself.""The Locket"":Seeing Aeryn and John grow old together brings a tear to my eye.and ""A Clockwork Nebari"":I don't think TV has ever been so graphic. Great work by Henson and Co.This season contains the worst three parter of the entire series, with the ""Look at the Princess"" trilogy and the best three parter of the series with the ""Liars, Guns, and Money"" trilogy.The work done by The Jim Henson company must be seen to be believed, I am glad I at least caught the show now, better late than never, and I hope to see a movie sometime in the near future. It's a testament to what SciFi should be and really raises the bar for television.The Cliff Hanger was brilliant, and the acting by the entire cast is superb.

Everyone paid $30.00 for these already. NOW they are releasing them as a boxed set. So fans that purchased the second season already basically got ripped off by about $35.00 when all is said and done.That doesn't effect the quality of the series nor the DVD transfers or extras. This is a great boxed set but ADV needs to get their stuff together and do right by fans of the show. You tick them off and they will stop buying your product. Personally, I'd tape the rest of the seasons at this stage I'm THAT FED UP WITH ADV.This was the best science fiction show on television. It was among the best written and wittiest. Sure, it could have gross out episodes and mundane ones as well but the best episodes stand up to Trek, B5, DS9, SG-1, etc. I'm just annoyed that, yet again, a company has chosen to take advantage of the fan base that supports their product. Maybe this type of stuff is why pirated CDs and DVDs have taken off.
