880332,A3OXHLG6DIBRW8,B0007DA3V6,"C. Hill ""CFH""","[2, 2]","The ""Highlander Series"" is simply fantastic and well worth the money for the set. The series follows the life of an immortal, Duncan MacLeod of the clan MacLeod (kinsman to Lambert's character in the originalHighlander).There is a strong ""Good vs Evil"", ""Right vs Wrong"" theme that runs through the entire series. Having the characters behave in a realist and consistent manner episode to episode really added to the believability and enjoyability of the series. When a character deviated it was usually for a good reason and added to the plot.The show feels only slightly dated, but the strong plot lines and great action more than compensate. Like any series, it certainly has a few ""slower"" episodes but, by and large, every episode is enjoyable if for no other reason than the well costumed ""flashbacks"" and inevitable ""big fight"".Adrian Paul was a perfect fit for the part of Duncan, being a decent actor, ""very good looking"" (according to my teenage daughter), being in great physical shape, and pulling off very challenging fight scenes.Highly recommended!",5,"Great Series, Not Just For the Sci-Fi Fan - Recommended",1225324800,"10 30, 2008",2008,1063,"['Highlander', 'Series', 'simply', 'fantastic', 'well', 'money', 'set', 'series', 'life', 'immortal', 'Duncan', 'MacLeod', 'clan', 'MacLeod', 'kinsman', 'Lambert', 'character', 'originalHighlander', 'strong', 'Good', 'vs', 'Evil', 'Right', 'vs', 'Wrong', 'theme', 'entire', 'series', 'Having', 'characters', 'behave', 'realist', 'consistent', 'manner', 'episode', 'episode', 'really', 'added', 'believability', 'enjoyability', 'series', 'When', 'character', 'deviated', 'was', 'usually', 'good', 'reason', 'added', 'plot.The', 'show', 'only', 'slightly', 'dated', 'strong', 'plot', 'lines', 'great', 'action', 'more', 'compensate', 'series', 'certainly', 'few', 'slower', 'episodes', 'large', 'episode', 'enjoyable', 'other', 'reason', 'well', 'costumed', 'flashbacks', 'inevitable', 'big', 'fight', '.Adrian', 'Paul', 'was', 'perfect', 'fit', 'part', 'Duncan', 'being', 'decent', 'actor', 'very', 'good', 'looking', 'according', 'teenage', 'daughter', 'being', 'great', 'physical', 'shape', 'pulling', 'off', 'very', 'challenging', 'fight', 'scenes.Highly', 'recommended']",N/A
880333,A2XM719J28KV2,B0007DA3V6,Cole,"[17, 22]","This show was sometimes great entertainment to me. Basically a dimestore romantic-adventure novel brought to life. I think the producers were mostly successful with providing something for everyone. The shows ranged from brilliantly written, to definitely a bit cheesey. The dvd collection is better than the vhs, however questions did arise quickly about it's quality. I think it was the 2nd episode on disc one, when the disc appeared to be sort of freezing up for a minute. I hit FF for a second, and it was fine again. ( This was with a brand new dvd player ) Since that occurance, I have not yet run into any other problems; although I've only watched 1/3 of  the discs. I did have a couple other little gripes about these dvd's, but nothing too serious. I would have preferred more than three episodes on a disc...a typical season for ex. has NINE discs-  three unfolding booklets of 3 discs, which all fit into this 1/2 box...I wasn't too crazy about that at all. There is however a lot of content within them if you like bloopers and interviews and watcher chronicles...I do and I don't.. I mean, it's tough enough to watch all 6 seasons..I really don't need boxes hoggin up all my shelf space just so studios get extra market value-which is also why it took em so long to go over to dvd's, and why it's off the air. Nevertheless, I do still appreciate the Highlander phenomenon. It's solidly entertaining while it also demonstrates virtues that I like. I can live without the Duncan Macleod boxer shorts though, and the pillows with kissy lips, and the rest of the merchandising extraveganza.

You can watch the characters grow and mature and meet some new and interesting immortals.  The best thing is you don't have to wait for the season to be renewed.  A good touch through out many of the episodes was the friendships and trust that developed between the mortals and the immortals.

880342,A2H1WNB30JNAWU,B0007DA3V6,Jack D. Lowry,"[0, 0]","Highlander the TV Show the whole set plus bonus DVD set with greatest hits of each season.  I will review it based on each season of the show, with only some highlights, Season one was a good introduction to the show to make us get into the storyline, rules of the game, characters, and enjoy some good music like Princes of the Universe, and Who wants to Live Forever.  For myself personally I enjoy the many Flashbacks, clothing styles for the flashbacks, mutiple guest stars as immortals and as the season goes on immortals you like and some you dislike.  I am sure we all have our favortie immortals I enjoy Darius and Fitz.  Season Two we see Ducan trying to find who killed Darius and why,  Ducan meets Joe Dawson and Joe informs him of what all he knows about immortals.  We see what living long enough can do to the mind and personality, As season goes on we see all the skills talents Ducan took in over the 400 years he has been alive like tracking someone, their is a bad watcher by name of Horton and Ducan wants him dead, we meet Richie and Amanda some good immortals plus some very bad immortals like Luther, and St. Cloud.  Season Three we see more killer action scenes, how Ducan gets his Dragon Head Sword,  we see how far Ducan takes his vow of honor, and to watch over people he cares about.  Ducan starts to have visions of his own death and makes him wonder if it is his time for death.  We see a human get Ducan behead a guy on video and tries to blackmail Ducan but doesn't work,  as season three goes on we see Kalas as main villian and how far he will go to destory everyone inculding himself to make sure Ducan is dead, we even meet Methos in this season.  Can you imagine living 5,000 years everything you can see and do oh the possiblities.  Season Four we see Ducan head home and fights an evil villian to save his town from the evil, we see how far the vilians will go to get back at Ducan hold a grude that long you get obsessive about it.  Two examples sick dogs onto him, and put him into a stright jacket.  As season goes on we see the dark side of immortality with a dark quickening and how it affects Ducan and everyone around him and what they do to save him from the darkness.  Season Five we see how angery Richie is and what he learn from Ducan and the trouble he gets himself into,  as season goes on we see immortals stuck within a certain time frame like 1920's for one immortal,  we see how some people in past sees a man die and comeback and considers him a god within their village and how the power can go to your head.  We also see Methos worst fear Kronos comes back finds him still alive and makes him help get the four horsemen together again like old days,  watch it to see how far Ducan and Methos go to protect everyone else on the Earth.  Season Six is the last season and only 13 shows, while past seasons were 18-22 shows.  We see Ducan on holy ground trying to figure things out and if we still wants to live,  fight the demons within the soul and mind,  as season goes on we see the writers trying to find a woman for the spin off series but hard choice indeed.  As season goes on we get to final two shows and see if Ducan wants to live or die,  but the makers of the show write it up allowing Ducan to see his life if he wasn't born and how his friends would have turn out, most of them immortals wise dead from beheadings, and Tessa married with kids, but we see Ducan choice life over death.  I might have not liked how the show ended but still an amazing show with tons of action, drama, suspense, with great artwork, and clothing styles takes your breathe away at how good people who do all that are so good at it.  So if you ever enjoyed tv shows with every element within the show then get this show if you don't have it already and enjoy the show as much as I did, I've watched the whole show twiced so far within my lifetime.

880360,ANM9NWZSNSQ9Q,B0007DA3V6,Theresa Flynn,"[125, 132]","I much prefer the television series to the films, but that is not to say the TV show was perfect.  The greatest weakness of both the TV series and the DVD disks would be inconsistencies.  While the show had many strengths, writing was often uneven and the ""mythos"" of the show was tweaked on more than one occasion to fit the needs of storyline.  This is sometimes awkward to watch, given that the one rule of fantasy is to stick to the ""givens"" you provide as a writer.  The DVDs are equally ""off"" a bit.  Commentary for the first two seasons is a tad snarky, and in season one, it sometimes looks like they grabbed the commentators on the way home from the grocery store to make their comments.  Later commentary feels somewhat like a bottle of wine (or two) was used to ""warm up"" the speakers.  The video capture also isn't great.  Originally produced in the early 90s, this was one of the earliest series to be transferred to digital format.  The kind of super-clean image and sound quality one becomes used to in modern DVDs are not present here, and my season one collection, bought many years ago, actually melted down.  The sealant used on the inside rim of the DVDs leaked back into the disks and warped them, causing the need for me to re-buy the collection.  I did, however, re-buy it, because for all of its flaws, there is something timeless about this show (excusing the obvious pun).  The show excelled in casting, with Adrian Paul being the best immortal out there (apologies to Christopher Lambert).  Mr. Paul not only had the exotic look appropriate to an immortal, but he clearly invested himself in the role in terms of physicality and dedication.  The fights and swordplay are still some of the best I've seen in film, and the actor's range really increased during the run of the show, with new layers of emotional depths explored in every passing season.  Adrian Paul was not the only good casting.  All of the supporting characters, including the several stunning women, sidekick Stan Kirsch, the yummy Peter Wingfield, earthy and warm Jim Byrnes, and so many more, were excellent.  Even the villains of the week were delightful.  Rock stars abounded, and while not all of them were top-shelf actors (Roger Daltrey being a notable exception), the music that infuses the show is deeply engaging, from the opening credits by Queen to Jim Byrnes' soulful guitar solos.  Half of each season was filmed in Paris.  This brought a real visual richness not usually seen in syndicated television, and the flashback scenes, spanning thousands of years, were almost always done with an excellence that is hard to imagine on their probable budgetary limits.  In terms of concept, the producers clearly struggled from time to time to find a way out of the ""bad immortal gets head cut off"" plotline that could have easily dominated the show.  While they clearly mis-stepped here and there, the end product, taken as a whole, is a thoughtful and touching one.  Duncan MacLeod is the ultimate hero figure ... noble, honorable, enviable perhaps, but deeply lonely.  There are a tremendous number of series regulars who don't quite make it to the end of any given season, much less the series, but by having them enter and leave the life of the Highlander, we see a humanity within the immortal that is tremendously engaging.  Despite the sometimes painful 80s fashion, I believe this series has a kind of universality.  Worth it to anyone who likes action, romance, drama, and a little bit of magic.  And who doesn't like all of that?",4,Flawed but worth it,1186185600,"08 4, 2007",2007,3540,"['much', 'prefer', 'television', 'series', 'films', 'not', 'say', 'TV', 'show', 'was', 'perfect', 'greatest', 'weakness', 'TV', 'series', 'DVD', 'disks', 'would', 'be', 'inconsistencies', 'show', 'had', 'many', 'strengths', 'writing', 'was', 'often', 'uneven', 'mythos', 'show', 'was', 'tweaked', 'more', 'one', 'occasion', 'fit', 'needs', 'storyline', 'sometimes', 'awkward', 'watch', 'given', 'one', 'rule', 'fantasy', 'stick', 'givens', 'provide', 'writer', 'DVDs', 'are', 'equally', 'off', 'bit', 'Commentary', 'first', 'two', 'seasons', 'tad', 'snarky', 'season', 'one', 'sometimes', 'grabbed', 'commentators', 'way', 'home', 'grocery', 'store', 'make', 'comments', 'Later', 'commentary', 'feels', 'somewhat', 'bottle', 'wine', 'two', 'was', 'used', 'warm', 'up', 'speakers', 'video', 'capture', 'also', ""n't"", 'great', 'Originally', 'produced', 'early', '90s', 'was', 'one', 'earliest', 'series', 'be', 'transferred', 'digital', 'format', 'kind', 'super-clean', 'image', 'sound', 'quality', 'one', 'used', 'modern', 'DVDs', 'are', 'not', 'present', 'here', 'season', 'one', 'collection', 'bought', 'many', 'years', 'ago', 'actually', 'melted', 'down', 'sealant', 'used', 'inside', 'rim', 'DVDs', 'leaked', 'back', 'disks', 'warped', 'causing', 'need', 're-buy', 'collection', 'did', 'however', 're-buy', 'flaws', 'something', 'timeless', 'show', 'excusing', 'obvious', 'pun', 'show', 'excelled', 'casting', 'Adrian', 'Paul', 'being', 'best', 'immortal', 'there', 'apologies', 'Christopher', 'Lambert', 'Mr.', 'Paul', 'not', 'only', 'had', 'exotic', 'look', 'appropriate', 'immortal', 'clearly', 'invested', 'role', 'terms', 'physicality', 'dedication', 'fights', 'swordplay', 'are', 'still', 'best', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'film', 'actor', 'range', 'really', 'increased', 'run', 'show', 'new', 'layers', 'emotional', 'depths', 'explored', 'passing', 'season', 'Adrian', 'Paul', 'was', 'not', 'only', 'good', 'casting', 'supporting', 'characters', 'including', 'several', 'stunning', 'women', 'sidekick', 'Stan', 'Kirsch', 'yummy', 'Peter', 'Wingfield', 'earthy', 'warm', 'Jim', 'Byrnes', 'so', 'many', 'more', 'were', 'excellent', 'Even', 'villains', 'week', 'were', 'delightful', 'Rock', 'stars', 'abounded', 'not', 'were', 'top-shelf', 'actors', 'Roger', 'Daltrey', 'being', 'notable', 'exception', 'music', 'show', 'deeply', 'engaging', 'opening', 'credits', 'Queen', 'Jim', 'Byrnes', 'soulful', 'guitar', 'solos', 'Half', 'season', 'was', 'filmed', 'Paris', 'brought', 'real', 'visual', 'richness', 'not', 'usually', 'seen', 'syndicated', 'television', 'flashback', 'scenes', 'spanning', 'thousands', 'years', 'were', 'almost', 'always', 'done', 'excellence', 'hard', 'imagine', 'probable', 'budgetary', 'limits', 'terms', 'concept', 'producers', 'clearly', 'struggled', 'time', 'time', 'find', 'way', 'bad', 'immortal', 'head', 'cut', 'off', 'plotline', 'could', 'have', 'easily', 'dominated', 'show', 'clearly', 'mis-stepped', 'here', 'there', 'end', 'product', 'taken', 'whole', 'thoughtful', 'touching', 'one', 'Duncan', 'MacLeod', 'ultimate', 'hero', 'figure', 'noble', 'honorable', 'enviable', 'perhaps', 'deeply', 'lonely', 'are', 'tremendous', 'number', 'series', 'regulars', 'who', 'do', ""n't"", 'quite', 'make', 'end', 'given', 'season', 'much', 'less', 'series', 'having', 'enter', 'leave', 'life', 'Highlander', 'see', 'humanity', 'immortal', 'tremendously', 'engaging', 'sometimes', 'painful', '80s', 'fashion', 'believe', 'series', 'kind', 'universality', 'anyone', 'who', 'action', 'romance', 'drama', 'little', 'bit', 'magic', 'who', ""n't"", 'like']",N/A

I would have bought the remaining seasons, but they were always too expensive for me. When I saw this set with all six season for sale, I decided the time was right to buy the whole set. Even if it meant I would have a duplicate first season, the price for the whole set was still much cheaper than just buying season 2 thru 6. When I got the set I found them well packaged and easy to get to with no scratches on the disks or any broken plastic disk holders.I was very pleased to find that the set also included the complete The Raven series as well. I had watched some of the shows when they were first broadcast, but I wasn't a big fan of the show and had missed many of the episodes. This set would now allow me to catch up with all the episodes I missed and how they interplayed with The Highlander series.The set also included a seperate set of fifteen of The Best of The Highlander episodes on five disks. This was interesting to have, but there was no real need for it since all the shows in the Best Of set were also in the regular set. The only exception was a sixth disk that included about three hours of bonus features about the making of the show.Overall, this was one of my favorite shows when it was on the air and I'm very happy to now have the complete series so I can watch them uncut and uninterrupted whenever I want.",5,Excellent Series with Bonus Material,1335225600,"04 24, 2012",2012,1444,"['had', 'been', 'big', 'fan', 'TV', 'series', 'when', 'was', 'air', 'had', 'even', 'bought', 'first', 'season', 'DVD', 'would', 'have', 'bought', 'remaining', 'seasons', 'were', 'always', 'too', 'expensive', 'When', 'saw', 'set', 'six', 'season', 'sale', 'decided', 'time', 'was', 'right', 'buy', 'whole', 'set', 'Even', 'meant', 'would', 'have', 'duplicate', 'first', 'season', 'price', 'whole', 'set', 'was', 'still', 'much', 'cheaper', 'just', 'buying', 'season', '2', 'thru', '6', 'When', 'got', 'set', 'found', 'well', 'packaged', 'easy', 'get', 'scratches', 'disks', 'broken', 'plastic', 'disk', 'holders.I', 'was', 'very', 'pleased', 'find', 'set', 'also', 'included', 'complete', 'Raven', 'series', 'as', 'well', 'had', 'watched', 'shows', 'when', 'were', 'first', 'broadcast', 'was', ""n't"", 'big', 'fan', 'show', 'had', 'missed', 'many', 'episodes', 'set', 'would', 'now', 'allow', 'catch', 'up', 'episodes', 'missed', 'how', 'interplayed', 'Highlander', 'series.The', 'set', 'also', 'included', 'seperate', 'set', 'fifteen', 'Best', 'Highlander', 'episodes', 'five', 'disks', 'was', 'interesting', 'have', 'was', 'real', 'need', 'shows', 'Best', 'set', 'were', 'also', 'regular', 'set', 'only', 'exception', 'was', 'sixth', 'disk', 'included', 'three', 'hours', 'bonus', 'features', 'making', 'show.Overall', 'was', 'one', 'favorite', 'shows', 'when', 'was', 'air', ""'m"", 'very', 'happy', 'now', 'have', 'complete', 'series', 'can', 'watch', 'uncut', 'uninterrupted', 'whenever', 'want']",N/A
