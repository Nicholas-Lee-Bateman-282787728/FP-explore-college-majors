1676398,A1CS70DT7ZPCJJ,B00G3BRC24,Kasey G,"[9, 12]","The fourth season of ""ALICE"" found the gang at Mel's Diner enjoying their highest ratings ever as the show finished #4 among all programs on the air during the 1979-80 TV Season. This was also a year of big changes as the show loses it's most popular character when Polly Holliday's Flo exits for her own short-lived spinoff series. ""Flo's Farewell"" is a bittersweet episode that gives the sassy redhead a fitting sendoff and contains a touching scene that Holliday and Tayback play perfectly. With Flo gone, ""ALICE"" loses it's best character, but good writing and strong performances keep the show going strong for the next couple of seasons at least.In what was likely seen by producers as a clever casting move, they brought in the original Flo from the 1974 film ""Alice Doesn't Live Here Anymore"" when Diane Ladd arrives as new character Belle Dupree, an ex-waitress of Mel's who returns from Mississippi with aspirations of becoming a famous country songwriter. Ladd appears in the season's final six episodes and some things about her character work and others don't. When Flo left, she took her famous catchphrase with her (""Kiss My Grits!"") and the writers try something for Belle, but instead of a simple three word phrase, they saddle her with the clunky ""My little voice calls me Isabelle"" which is thankfully dropped quickly after a few unsuccessful attempts to turn it into a running gag.Despite the cast change, ""ALICE"" still delivers some great episodes this season. ""Vera the Vamp"" is one of the season's best and made a strong showing when WB polled fans back in 2006 for their picks to be included on the Fan Favorites disc. Also of note is the season-opener with guest star Telly Savalas containing a terrific scene in which Lavin serenades him on bended-knee imploring him to return to the diner to dissuade Vera from quitting. Mel's famous chili steals the show in THREE separate episodes this season. First, Mel fires Flo when he believes she gave his recipe to his biggest competitor. Later, Mel's invited to prepare his chili on Dinah Shore's TV show and finally tries to get Art Carney to endorse it as Chili con Carney. ""Good Buddy Flo"" features a hilarious and elaborate sight-gag as a jealous Flo crashes her two-timing trucker boyfriend's rig through the wall of Mel's diner.Even if you aren't a fan of the Belle character, this one is a must-have being Flo's last hurrah on the series. Now that the character has exited ""ALICE"", hopefully her spinoff will be released by Warner Archive shortly since the episodes have already been available as digital download on Amazon for several years now.",5,Goodbye Florence Jean...Hello Belle Dupree!,1382659200,"10 25, 2013",2013,2623,"['fourth', 'season', 'ALICE', 'found', 'gang', 'Mel', 'Diner', 'enjoying', 'highest', 'ratings', 'ever', 'show', 'finished', '4', 'programs', 'air', '1979-80', 'TV', 'Season', 'was', 'also', 'year', 'big', 'changes', 'show', 'most', 'popular', 'character', 'when', 'Polly', 'Holliday', 'Flo', 'own', 'short-lived', 'spinoff', 'series', 'Flo', 'Farewell', 'bittersweet', 'episode', 'sassy', 'redhead', 'fitting', 'sendoff', 'touching', 'scene', 'Holliday', 'Tayback', 'play', 'perfectly', 'Flo', 'gone', 'ALICE', 'best', 'character', 'good', 'writing', 'strong', 'performances', 'keep', 'show', 'going', 'strong', 'next', 'couple', 'seasons', 'least.In', 'what', 'was', 'likely', 'seen', 'producers', 'clever', 'casting', 'move', 'brought', 'original', 'Flo', '1974', 'film', 'Alice', 'Does', ""n't"", 'Live', 'Here', 'Anymore', 'when', 'Diane', 'Ladd', 'new', 'character', 'Belle', 'Dupree', 'ex-waitress', 'Mel', 'who', 'Mississippi', 'aspirations', 'becoming', 'famous', 'country', 'songwriter', 'Ladd', 'season', 'final', 'six', 'episodes', 'things', 'character', 'work', 'others', 'do', ""n't"", 'When', 'Flo', 'left', 'took', 'famous', 'catchphrase', 'Kiss', 'My', 'writers', 'try', 'something', 'Belle', 'instead', 'simple', 'three', 'word', 'phrase', 'saddle', 'clunky', 'little', 'voice', 'Isabelle', 'thankfully', 'dropped', 'quickly', 'few', 'unsuccessful', 'attempts', 'turn', 'running', 'gag.Despite', 'cast', 'change', 'ALICE', 'still', 'great', 'episodes', 'season', 'Vamp', 'one', 'season', 'best', 'made', 'strong', 'showing', 'when', 'WB', 'polled', 'fans', 'back', '2006', 'picks', 'be', 'included', 'Fan', 'Favorites', 'disc', 'Also', 'note', 'season-opener', 'guest', 'star', 'Telly', 'Savalas', 'containing', 'terrific', 'scene', 'Lavin', 'bended-knee', 'imploring', 'return', 'diner', 'dissuade', 'Vera', 'quitting', 'Mel', 'famous', 'chili', 'show', 'THREE', 'separate', 'episodes', 'season', 'First', 'Mel', 'Flo', 'when', 'gave', 'recipe', 'biggest', 'competitor', 'Later', 'Mel', 'invited', 'prepare', 'chili', 'Dinah', 'Shore', 'TV', 'show', 'finally', 'tries', 'get', 'Art', 'Carney', 'endorse', 'Chili', 'con', 'Carney', 'Good', 'Buddy', 'Flo', 'hilarious', 'elaborate', 'sight-gag', 'jealous', 'Flo', 'two-timing', 'trucker', 'boyfriend', 'rig', 'wall', 'Mel', 'diner.Even', 'are', ""n't"", 'fan', 'Belle', 'character', 'one', 'must-have', 'being', 'Flo', 'last', 'hurrah', 'series', 'Now', 'character', 'exited', 'ALICE', 'hopefully', 'spinoff', 'will', 'be', 'released', 'Warner', 'Archive', 'shortly', 'episodes', 'have', 'already', 'been', 'available', 'digital', 'download', 'Amazon', 'several', 'years', 'now']",Alice: The Complete Fourth Season

""Alice"" was an awesome ensemble show while Polly Holliday was a member.  The problem is, Linda Lavin certainly wasn't why people watched the show.  Polly Holliday is for whom ""Alice"" will be remembered, and this season is her last.  Diane Ladd is an extraordinary actress (no argument there), and even though she was the original ""Flo"" in ""Alice Doesn't Live Here Anymore,"" once Polly Holliday embodied the character, she was irreplaceable.Others will certainly disagree, but for me (and many, many others), ""Alice"" started and ended with Flo, no matter how many seasons the show ran.

Her replacement Diane Ladd simply did not blend well with the other characters - maybe that's why she ended up leaving too.
