1079632,A13E0ARAXI6KJW,B000R7HY00,Ed Uyeshima,"[14, 16]","A trio of fine veteran actors is on display in this desultory 2007 drama that makes an attempt at emotional uplift but doesn't quite make it. Directed by Marc Evans and written by Angela Pell, this small-scale indie taps into themes of emotional isolation and moving on after a devastating personal loss, subjects covered with greater dexterity and humor by similarly wintry films like Lars and the Real Girl. The story centers on a solitary middle-aged Brit named Alex Hughes, whose veiled bitterness masks a personal tragedy that had led to a prison term. Recently released, he is on a cross-country journey to Winnipeg when he finds himself entangled with a chatty teen-aged hitchhiker named Vivienne seeking passage home to the small Ontario town of Wawa.A viscerally shocking moment leads Alex quite unexpectedly to meet Vivienne's mother Linda, a high-functioning autistic woman who is manically fastidious and emotionally disconnected from the people around her. Before you can sayRain Man, Alex and Linda forge a friendly alliance in which life lessons are learned, often under adversity, until the two must part. Meanwhile, an attraction is sparked between Alex and Linda's next-door neighbor Maggie, a sultry yet kindly divorcee whom Linda thinks is a prostitute. Give Pell credit for steering clear of the life-affirming clich&eacute;s that would have marked this as a misplaced Lifetime TV-movie. Pell's personal insights are invaluable given that she has an autistic son. At the same time, Evans' handling of Alex's spiritual reawakening lacks the intensity that would have allowed the film to take flight.Playing the sympathetic protagonist for a change, Alan Rickman brings the necessary gravitas to his textured performance as Alex with enough of his dry wit to leaven at least some of the proceedings. In a fearless turn obviously inspired by Dustin Hoffman's award-winning work inRain Man, Sigourney Weaver approaches the difficult role of Linda with vigor and a liberating lack of vanity, though there are moments when I can see the smart actress underneath. Carrie-Anne Moss lends surprising heart and a beguiling sexiness to Maggie. Also noteworthy is Steve Cosens' clean cinematography which nicely captures the wintry feel of rural Ontario. The 2007 DVD is bereft of the standard extras like a director's commentary or a making-of featurette, but there are ten deleted scenes of varying interest and the original theatrical trailer.",3,"Autism, Death and Other Heavy Topics Addressed in a Wintry Character Study",1198108800,"12 20, 2007",2007,2455,"['trio', 'fine', 'veteran', 'actors', 'display', 'desultory', '2007', 'drama', 'attempt', 'emotional', 'uplift', ""n't"", 'quite', 'make', 'Directed', 'Marc', 'Evans', 'written', 'Angela', 'Pell', 'small-scale', 'indie', 'taps', 'themes', 'emotional', 'isolation', 'moving', 'devastating', 'personal', 'loss', 'subjects', 'covered', 'greater', 'dexterity', 'humor', 'similarly', 'wintry', 'films', 'Lars', 'Real', 'Girl', 'story', 'centers', 'solitary', 'middle-aged', 'Brit', 'named', 'Alex', 'Hughes', 'veiled', 'bitterness', 'personal', 'tragedy', 'had', 'led', 'prison', 'term', 'Recently', 'released', 'cross-country', 'journey', 'Winnipeg', 'when', 'entangled', 'chatty', 'teen-aged', 'hitchhiker', 'named', 'Vivienne', 'seeking', 'passage', 'home', 'small', 'Ontario', 'town', 'Wawa.A', 'viscerally', 'shocking', 'moment', 'Alex', 'quite', 'unexpectedly', 'meet', 'Vivienne', 'mother', 'Linda', 'high-functioning', 'autistic', 'woman', 'who', 'manically', 'fastidious', 'emotionally', 'disconnected', 'people', 'can', 'sayRain', 'Man', 'Alex', 'Linda', 'forge', 'friendly', 'alliance', 'life', 'lessons', 'are', 'learned', 'often', 'adversity', 'two', 'must', 'part', 'Meanwhile', 'attraction', 'sparked', 'Alex', 'Linda', 'next-door', 'neighbor', 'Maggie', 'sultry', 'yet', 'kindly', 'divorcee', 'whom', 'Linda', 'prostitute', 'Give', 'Pell', 'credit', 'steering', 'clear', 'life-affirming', 'clich', 'eacute', 'would', 'have', 'marked', 'misplaced', 'Lifetime', 'TV-movie', 'Pell', 'personal', 'insights', 'are', 'invaluable', 'given', 'autistic', 'son', 'same', 'time', 'Evans', 'handling', 'Alex', 'spiritual', 'reawakening', 'intensity', 'would', 'have', 'allowed', 'film', 'take', 'flight.Playing', 'sympathetic', 'protagonist', 'change', 'Alan', 'Rickman', 'necessary', 'gravitas', 'textured', 'performance', 'Alex', 'enough', 'dry', 'wit', 'leaven', 'least', 'proceedings', 'fearless', 'turn', 'obviously', 'inspired', 'Dustin', 'Hoffman', 'award-winning', 'work', 'inRain', 'Man', 'Sigourney', 'Weaver', 'difficult', 'role', 'Linda', 'vigor', 'liberating', 'lack', 'vanity', 'are', 'moments', 'when', 'can', 'see', 'smart', 'actress', 'underneath', 'Carrie-Anne', 'Moss', 'surprising', 'heart', 'beguiling', 'sexiness', 'Maggie', 'Also', 'noteworthy', 'Steve', 'Cosens', 'clean', 'cinematography', 'nicely', 'wintry', 'feel', 'rural', 'Ontario', '2007', 'DVD', 'bereft', 'standard', 'extras', 'director', 'commentary', 'making-of', 'featurette', 'are', 'ten', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'varying', 'interest', 'original', 'theatrical', 'trailer']",N/A
1079633,A34GZPHWYPSY2T,B000R7HY00,"E. Hernandez ""Call me Harry""","[2, 2]","SNOW CAKE (for the Independent Film Channel, 2006, 110 minutes, Canadian release) is one of those fantastic pleasures I am serendipitous enough to encounter on a regular basis. This English-produced Canadian film starring Alan Rickman and Sigourney Weaver is a glorious gift to the really-good-drama-deprived.Britisher Alex Hughes (Rickman) meets the lovely and vivacious young Vivienne Freeman (the beautiful Emily Hampshire) in a little Canadian diner on the road to Winnipeg. Vivienne seems a bit funny and hyperactive, but it transpires that she's just the thing. Having secured a ride with Alex to her home town of Wawa (yes, 'tis a real place I think, but this was shot in Grosso Jackson, Ontario) the two are promptly rammed by a semi. Vivienne dies instantly. She was on her way for her ritual home visit with her autistic mother Linda (a brilliant Sigourney Weaver).Carrying demons of his own from a troubled past, Alex proceeds to the home of Vivienne's mother. Living alone, very high-functioning but still requiring supervision and assistance, Linda takes to Alex begrudgingly and accepts the death of her daughter with a weird aplomb. A beautiful, gentle comedy-drama unfolds as Alex is prized out of his pain-wracked shell by Linda. Linda, of course, remains impenetrable and irascible.I absolutely adore all the stars with Rickman being perhaps my favorite actor living and working today. The film is a wonder to behold, and all I can really grouse about is the annoying habit of inserting music videos into these otherwise perfect films. Not everything has to have a damned soundtrack of annoying college music.Do not fear this film's no-nonsense approach to high-functioning autistic adults. While it immediately became a very annoying clich&eacute; ever sinceRain Man, it can still provide an excellent base for good drama as it does here. Films to avoid are autism-centered monstrosities likeMozart And The Whale(2005),Mercury Rising(1998) andAdam(2009). I do recommendExtremely Loud & Incredibly Close(2011), which seems to have been partly inspired by SNOW CAKE.If autism interests you, it must be known that even though RAIN MAN boosted autism awareness, I was part of a global campaign to get the milder Asperger's autism into the news. My first book (No Duty To Retreat: The Stories of Tourette's Syndrome and Asperger's Autism) deals with the subject and the move to get this into popular awareness may be attributed to Dr. Oliver Sacks. My sensitivity and interest stem from the fact that I am autistic.It was Dr. Sacks who felt so angered by the world's ignorance of autistic adults ~ and SNOW CAKE struck me as a bizarre movie because real-life people like Linda are not simply abandoned to make shift by themselves. Supervision and assistance are needed 24 hours a day. My wife, who is a special ed teacher, found that detail very disturbing. In fact she tried to avoid watching this film, but was ultimately mesmerized by Weaver's performance.Rarely do I include such details, but I understand Rickman was envisioned all along for the role of Alex and was the first to sign onto the film. When he read the script and agreed to do it, he called Sigourney Weaver and talked her into accepting the role of Linda.

This is not at all a bad movie. In fact it's quite good. But there isn't much here you haven't already seen before.Here's the scoop. Rickman is fresh out of prison on a murder rap. He's on his way to see his late son's mother (who is not his wife) and allows a quirky little sprite of a girl to grab a ride with him. Horrible accident. Girl dies. He's beside himself with grief and heads to her home to tell her mom who turns out to be an autistic Sigourney Weaver. He ends up getting caught up in her life and the lives of some of the other locals.Rickman is his usual good self. I like Sigourney Weaver enough but she really does a good job here. This is a very different roll for her and I'm glad she took it on. I'd never have guessed she had this much in her. I'd pay to watch Carrie-Anne Moss eat cornflakes so I cannot really comment on her performance here. Everyone else does a stand up job. The production values aren't high but they don't let the bones show. The music is good. Most of the songs are from Canada's ""Broken Social Scene."" It also has one really wild song in a key scene that might be a Japanese folk song 'Notteru Ondo.""This is not new. A person needs to get his/her life back after some tragedy and ends up in an unexpected situation that helps him/her do just that. The kick here is the Weaver character. Where I thought it might be her daughter performing the life affirming task it ends up being Sigourney herself. That does work in unexpected ways, but much of the rest of the script outline is formulaic. You've seen some of these scenes before. Some, more than a few times. Yes, it's done well but it's not new. And it's more than a bit slow. It clocks in just shy of two hours and I was getting antsy.If you enjoy these kinds of movies this is not at all a bad watch, but if you're groing tired of them you might want to take a pass.",3,More Like Three and a Half,1306195200,"05 24, 2011",2011,1982,"['do', ""n't"", 'know', 'Maybe', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'too', 'many', 'type', 'drama', 'are', 'getting', 'more', 'difficult', 'sit', 'not', 'bad', 'movie', 'fact', 'quite', 'good', ""n't"", 'much', 'here', 'have', ""n't"", 'already', 'seen', 'scoop', 'Rickman', 'fresh', 'prison', 'murder', 'rap', 'way', 'see', 'late', 'son', 'mother', 'who', 'not', 'wife', 'quirky', 'little', 'sprite', 'girl', 'grab', 'ride', 'Horrible', 'accident', 'Girl', 'beside', 'grief', 'heads', 'home', 'tell', 'mom', 'who', 'out', 'be', 'autistic', 'Sigourney', 'Weaver', 'up', 'getting', 'caught', 'up', 'life', 'lives', 'other', 'locals.Rickman', 'usual', 'good', 'self', 'Sigourney', 'Weaver', 'enough', 'really', 'good', 'job', 'here', 'very', 'different', 'roll', ""'m"", 'glad', 'took', ""'d"", 'never', 'have', 'guessed', 'had', 'much', ""'d"", 'pay', 'watch', 'Carrie-Anne', 'Moss', 'eat', 'cornflakes', 'can', 'not', 'really', 'comment', 'performance', 'here', 'Everyone', 'else', 'stand', 'up', 'job', 'production', 'values', 'are', ""n't"", 'high', 'do', ""n't"", 'let', 'bones', 'show', 'music', 'good', 'Most', 'songs', 'are', 'Canada', 'Broken', 'Social', 'Scene', 'also', 'one', 'really', 'wild', 'song', 'key', 'scene', 'might', 'be', 'Japanese', 'folk', 'song', 'Ondo', 'not', 'new', 'person', 'get', 'his/her', 'life', 'back', 'tragedy', 'up', 'unexpected', 'situation', 'him/her', 'do', 'just', 'kick', 'here', 'Weaver', 'character', 'Where', 'thought', 'might', 'be', 'daughter', 'performing', 'life', 'affirming', 'task', 'up', 'being', 'Sigourney', 'work', 'unexpected', 'ways', 'much', 'rest', 'script', 'outline', 'formulaic', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'scenes', 'more', 'few', 'times', 'Yes', 'done', 'well', 'not', 'new', 'more', 'bit', 'slow', 'just', 'shy', 'two', 'hours', 'was', 'getting', 'antsy.If', 'enjoy', 'kinds', 'movies', 'not', 'bad', 'watch', ""'re"", 'groing', 'tired', 'might', 'want', 'take', 'pass']",N/A

1079637,AQSQLWD3NLMAS,B000R7HY00,Glenn A. Buttkus,"[7, 7]","Welsh-born film director, Marc Evans, who has given us HOUSE OF AMERICA (1997), and RESURRECTION MAN (1998), stepped back from the Thriller/Horror genre, and was lured to the wilds of Wawa, Ontario--a small Canadian town of 4,000 that is lorded over by a huge statue of a snow goose, by a very sensitive script written by Angela Pell, and a powerhouse dream cast. SNOW CAKE is a film about pain, retribution, angst, revenge, inner demons, middle-aged angst and sex, disabilities, small town idiosyncrasies and politics, acceptance, and love--that can rear its beautiful mug in the dangdest places at the weirdest times.The poster tagline was, ""sometimes stopping is the most important part of the journey."" An ex-convict, Alex (Alan Rickman) was on a road trip, a painful and emotional odyssey, to Winnipeg. He harbored dark secrets and stress, and we are not at first aware of the exact nature of his ""crime"". At a truck stop diner, the reserved and taciturn Alex met a loquacious, bubbly, sweet yet eccentric young woman--Vivienne (Emily Hampshire). Reluctantly, Alex offered her a ride to Wawa.Tragically, just as they pulled out onto the highway they were T-boned by an 18 wheeler semi. Vivienne was killed, but Alex emerged without a scratch. Traumatized, he decided to contact the girl's mother to convey his condolences and regrets. When he met the mother, Linda (Sigourney Weaver), he was confronted with a middle-aged highly-functioning autistic woman. She seemed to beguile him with her lack of emotion, and she invited him to stay with her until Vivienne's funeral--so that he could, ""take out the garbage on Tuesday. Vivienne always did that. I don't do garbage.""Alex did stay for several days, and he found a gentle way to co-exist with Linda's eccentricities, her obsession with cleanliness, her fascination with ""sparkling"" things, her need to jump often on her trampoline, her love of eating snow, and her need to keep all hands and feet out of her kitchen. Soon Alex met the attractive next-door neighbor, Maggie (Carrie-Anne Moss), and they made an attempt to ""start"" a relationship. Before the funeral, we discovered Alex's pain-ridden past, and why he railed so emotionally against the truck driver (Callum Keith Rennie)--we met Linda's wonderful parents, who had raised Vivienne, and we learned to appreciate the relative independence that Linda had carved out laboriously for her self.Sigourney Weaver was astonishingly good, just excellent, as Linda. She had studied Autism, and somehow found a way to deglamorize herself, and be emerged completely in the tic-ridden, quirky yet likeable Linda. The writer Angela Pell, has an autistic son, and so understands the bumpy emotional terrain she wrote about. Alan Rickman of the dour smirk, quick wit, and carefully phrased speech, found a character in Alex that was flawed and still redeemable, middle-aged sexy, very capable of terrible anger, yet equally capable of growth, of an epiphany, who at the end of his journey in Wawa discovered some form of acceptance and patience. Carrie-Anne Moss presented us with a Maggie who was outspoken, an outsider in a small town, sexually emancipated, fiercely independent, well read, well versed, needy yet giving, warm and real, yet still vulnerable, and of course incredibly sensual. She took what was essentially a ""nothing role"", embraced it and breathed life into it.SNOW CAKE like other Canadian winter dramas, reminiscent of Atom Egoyan's THE SWEET HEREAFTER (1997), and Sarah Polley's AWAY FROM HER (2006), created a movie malleable microcosm of humanity and human nature--that touches us as it teaches, that provided a lively peek into the lives and hearts of several unique and ""special"" characters. It is a quiet film that nevertheless grips our shoulders firmly, a stern but patient tutor who had an interesting lesson to share.",4,Kiss of Ice,1205280000,"03 12, 2008",2008,3851,"['Welsh-born', 'film', 'director', 'Marc', 'Evans', 'who', 'given', 'HOUSE', 'AMERICA', '1997', 'RESURRECTION', 'MAN', '1998', 'stepped', 'back', 'Thriller/Horror', 'genre', 'was', 'lured', 'wilds', 'Wawa', 'Ontario', 'small', 'Canadian', 'town', '4,000', 'lorded', 'huge', 'statue', 'snow', 'goose', 'very', 'sensitive', 'script', 'written', 'Angela', 'Pell', 'powerhouse', 'dream', 'cast', 'SNOW', 'CAKE', 'film', 'pain', 'retribution', 'angst', 'revenge', 'inner', 'demons', 'middle-aged', 'angst', 'sex', 'disabilities', 'small', 'town', 'idiosyncrasies', 'politics', 'acceptance', 'love', 'can', 'rear', 'beautiful', 'mug', 'dangdest', 'places', 'weirdest', 'times.The', 'poster', 'tagline', 'was', 'sometimes', 'stopping', 'most', 'important', 'part', 'journey', 'ex-convict', 'Alex', 'Alan', 'Rickman', 'was', 'road', 'trip', 'painful', 'emotional', 'odyssey', 'Winnipeg', 'harbored', 'dark', 'secrets', 'stress', 'are', 'not', 'first', 'aware', 'exact', 'nature', 'crime', 'truck', 'stop', 'diner', 'reserved', 'taciturn', 'Alex', 'met', 'loquacious', 'bubbly', 'sweet', 'yet', 'eccentric', 'young', 'woman', 'Vivienne', 'Emily', 'Hampshire', 'Reluctantly', 'Alex', 'offered', 'ride', 'Wawa.Tragically', 'just', 'pulled', 'out', 'highway', 'were', 'T-boned', '18', 'wheeler', 'semi', 'Vivienne', 'was', 'killed', 'Alex', 'emerged', 'scratch', 'Traumatized', 'decided', 'contact', 'girl', 'mother', 'convey', 'condolences', 'regrets', 'When', 'met', 'mother', 'Linda', 'Sigourney', 'Weaver', 'was', 'confronted', 'middle-aged', 'highly-functioning', 'autistic', 'woman', 'seemed', 'beguile', 'lack', 'emotion', 'invited', 'stay', 'Vivienne', 'funeral', 'so', 'could', 'take', 'out', 'garbage', 'Tuesday', 'Vivienne', 'always', 'did', 'do', ""n't"", 'do', 'garbage', 'Alex', 'did', 'stay', 'several', 'days', 'found', 'gentle', 'way', 'co-exist', 'Linda', 'eccentricities', 'obsession', 'cleanliness', 'fascination', 'sparkling', 'things', 'need', 'jump', 'often', 'trampoline', 'love', 'eating', 'snow', 'need', 'keep', 'hands', 'feet', 'kitchen', 'Soon', 'Alex', 'met', 'attractive', 'next-door', 'neighbor', 'Maggie', 'Carrie-Anne', 'Moss', 'made', 'attempt', 'start', 'relationship', 'funeral', 'discovered', 'Alex', 'pain-ridden', 'past', 'why', 'railed', 'so', 'emotionally', 'truck', 'driver', 'Callum', 'Keith', 'Rennie', 'met', 'Linda', 'wonderful', 'parents', 'who', 'had', 'raised', 'Vivienne', 'learned', 'appreciate', 'relative', 'independence', 'Linda', 'had', 'carved', 'out', 'laboriously', 'self.Sigourney', 'Weaver', 'was', 'astonishingly', 'good', 'just', 'excellent', 'Linda', 'had', 'studied', 'Autism', 'somehow', 'found', 'way', 'deglamorize', 'be', 'emerged', 'completely', 'tic-ridden', 'quirky', 'yet', 'likeable', 'Linda', 'writer', 'Angela', 'Pell', 'autistic', 'son', 'so', 'bumpy', 'emotional', 'terrain', 'wrote', 'about', 'Alan', 'Rickman', 'dour', 'smirk', 'quick', 'wit', 'carefully', 'phrased', 'speech', 'found', 'character', 'Alex', 'was', 'flawed', 'still', 'redeemable', 'middle-aged', 'sexy', 'very', 'capable', 'terrible', 'anger', 'yet', 'equally', 'capable', 'growth', 'epiphany', 'who', 'end', 'journey', 'Wawa', 'discovered', 'form', 'acceptance', 'patience', 'Carrie-Anne', 'Moss', 'presented', 'Maggie', 'who', 'was', 'outspoken', 'outsider', 'small', 'town', 'sexually', 'emancipated', 'fiercely', 'independent', 'well', 'read', 'well', 'versed', 'needy', 'yet', 'giving', 'warm', 'real', 'yet', 'still', 'vulnerable', 'course', 'incredibly', 'sensual', 'took', 'what', 'was', 'essentially', 'nothing', 'role', 'embraced', 'breathed', 'life', 'it.SNOW', 'CAKE', 'other', 'Canadian', 'winter', 'dramas', 'reminiscent', 'Atom', 'Egoyan', 'THE', 'SWEET', 'HEREAFTER', '1997', 'Sarah', 'Polley', 'AWAY', 'FROM', 'HER', '2006', 'created', 'movie', 'malleable', 'microcosm', 'humanity', 'human', 'nature', 'provided', 'lively', 'peek', 'lives', 'hearts', 'several', 'unique', 'special', 'characters', 'quiet', 'film', 'nevertheless', 'shoulders', 'firmly', 'stern', 'patient', 'tutor', 'who', 'had', 'interesting', 'lesson', 'share']",N/A

1079639,A3ML2HRDE3PY5I,B000R7HY00,Hikari,"[6, 7]","Continuing with my 'wintery' theme in movies lately, I added this small, quirky joint UK-Canada feature to my list. Alan Rickman (whom I adore) is in relatively few films, so he was the main draw here. Sigourney Weaver can be brilliant depending on the material (""Alien""; ""Working Girl""), or she can be a collection of patented mannerisms, it all depends. This performance hit somewhere in the middle for me. (**Mild Spoilers**) She plays Linda, an autistic woman living in a small Canadian town where her eccentricities are well-known & mostly tolerated by neighbors, though the local cab company refuses any more calls to Linda's address. Rickman plays Alec, a sad, private man who we first meet sitting alone at a roadside diner with a book. A vivacious young hitchiker comes in, invites herself to sit at a Alec's table & asks him for a ride. Alec tells his new passenger that he just got released from prison and says ""I just wanted you to be aware that it's the average-looking people you have to be careful of."" Before he can reveal more of himself, a careless truck driver rams into them, killing the girl instantly. Racked with guilt, Alec makes the journey to see her mother, none other than Linda, & these two form a very odd couple as he winds up staying at Linda's home for several days to help her with funeral arrangements for her daughter.Linda is a high-functioning autistic, extremely verbal but held hostage by her various tics, which manifest in obsessions about germs and dirt & continual straightening things around her home. Only a few things give her joy & distract her from her compulsions: 'sparklies'--toys with light & movement; jumping on her backyard trampline & eating snow. She is matter-of-fact about her loss: ""I didn't lose her; she's dead,"" she tells one neighbor. Linda was extremely dependent on her daughter, but any maternal grief she feels has to fight its way out of the layers of her neuroses. In fact, of greatest concern to her is that Alec stick around until Tuesday . .not because the funeral is on Monday, but because Tuesday is garbage day and ""I don't do garbage. Vivienne always took care of the garbage.""It's a committed, energetic & completly vanity-free performance by Weaver, with Rickman functioning as the 'neurotypical' representative of the audience. Since he is a deeply broken man who has been isolated from socieity for years, only someone as dysfunctional as Linda could actually make him feel normal again. We've had a long tradition in cinema of 'normal' actors playing characters with intellectual disabilities: Dustin Hoffman as Rain Man; Cliff Robertson as 'Charly'; Mary Stuart Masterson in ""Benny & Joon"", Hugh Dancy in ""Adam"", to name just a few. So Weaver's portrait of an autistic woman is as 'realistic' as a normal person can make it, but there will always be that artifice around it . . .maybe it is presumptuous in the extreme for the 'neurotypical' actors and scriptwriters & directors attempting a story about the intellectually-challenged to portray a facsimilie of a disorder they haven't experienced first-hand. Weaver's Linda lacks the endearing sweetness of Dustin Hoffman's Raymond, but perhaps is closer to a 'typical' sufferer of this disorder.

The full half first: Sigourney Weaver gives probably the best acting performance in her career up to now as Linda, a middle-age woman with autism whose daughter Vivienne is killed in a traffic accident and who deals with the aftermath in her own way. Alan Rickman is equally as good as Alex, a loner and the driver of the car in which Vivienne is killed. Alex attempts to pay his respects to Linda and what follows is the interaction of two closed-off souls unwittingly helping each other through what has hurt them, past (Alex) and present (Linda). When the movie is on the two of them together, it hits every right note you could ask for in a movie. Weaver is particularly adept at evoking an autistic person. Linda's character is another facet of autism, very different from the autistic man Dustin Hoffman plays in RAIN MAN, and as disagreeable and hard to like as Linda is much of the time, she also comes across as very aware of the world around her and how she can best cope with it.Where the movie is less sucessful is on Alex's side of the story. While, as said, Alan Rickman does a wonderful job of conveying a broken man trying to become whole again, his character's background and motivations are never made clear enough. Eventually his story comes out in dribs and drabs, but somehow you don't care as much about it as you do about Linda and her immediate tragedy. There's also a romantic subplot between Alex and one of Linda's neighbors, Maggie (Carrie-Anne Moss) which feels both inexplicable and unnecessary, although Moss is quite good in her role. And things get wrapped up just a little too neatly at the end, as if the director and screenwriter felt the they HAD to have a resolution. But life doesn't end neatly; why does a movie have to?Whether these are quibbles or major obstacles to one's enjoying the film is a subjective judgement, but I don't think anyone watching SNOW CAKE will get up from it feeling like their time was wasted.

However, the film is rather slow, and the indoor sets have dismal dark lighting--not exactly cheery or uplifting. The character of Maggie (played by Carrie-Anne Moss) is the least developed and somewhat of an enigma.(WARNING: SPOILER) The story centers around the redemption of the characters, as they meet around the central event of the daughter's death and the resulting funeral arrangements. Rickman, an ex-con who had killed a man in a rage (the man had been driving drunk and killed Rickman's son), re-lives that event all over again but this time has the chance to do it right. Weaver learns how to become more social. And Maggie? It appears that Maggie now has a new friend in Rickman, even though he decides to leave the little town and move on in his life. At least Maggie is now able to enter Weaver's house, despite Weaver's protests, to help with chores etc. We also see a change in the people of the small town as they learn to become more tolerant of Weaver's unconventional responses to death, to lots of people in her house, and more.Despite the good to excellent acting of Weaver and Rickman, I wouldn't recommend this movie unless you wanted a slow night and had nothing else to watch.",2,"Good actingl But slow, uneven plot, and unfinished characters",1194134400,"11 4, 2007",2007,1405,"['Sigourney', 'Weaver', 'was', 'brilliant', 'very', 'verbal', 'autistic', 'woman', 'who', 'daughter', 'auto', 'accident', 'Alan', 'Rickman', 'credible', 'job', 'driver', 'who', 'had', 'picked', 'up', 'hitchhiking', '15-year-old', 'However', 'film', 'rather', 'slow', 'indoor', 'sets', 'have', 'dismal', 'dark', 'lighting', 'not', 'exactly', 'uplifting', 'character', 'Maggie', 'played', 'Carrie-Anne', 'Moss', 'least', 'developed', 'somewhat', 'enigma', 'WARNING', 'SPOILER', 'story', 'centers', 'redemption', 'characters', 'meet', 'central', 'event', 'daughter', 'death', 'resulting', 'funeral', 'arrangements', 'Rickman', 'ex-con', 'who', 'had', 'killed', 'man', 'rage', 'man', 'had', 'been', 'driving', 'drunk', 'killed', 'Rickman', 'son', 're-lives', 'event', 'over', 'again', 'time', 'chance', 'do', 'right', 'Weaver', 'how', 'become', 'more', 'social', 'Maggie', 'Maggie', 'now', 'new', 'friend', 'Rickman', 'even', 'leave', 'little', 'town', 'move', 'life', 'least', 'Maggie', 'now', 'able', 'enter', 'Weaver', 'house', 'Weaver', 'protests', 'help', 'chores', 'etc', 'also', 'see', 'change', 'people', 'small', 'town', 'learn', 'become', 'more', 'tolerant', 'Weaver', 'unconventional', 'responses', 'death', 'lots', 'people', 'house', 'more.Despite', 'good', 'excellent', 'acting', 'Weaver', 'Rickman', 'would', ""n't"", 'recommend', 'movie', 'wanted', 'slow', 'night', 'had', 'nothing', 'else', 'watch']",N/A

1079653,A376UHS8GODI8W,B000R7HY00,Patrick Selitrenny,"[4, 4]","Let me say, just up front, that when I watched this on television I was almost compelled to switch channels.I simply don't like romantic or sentimental (tear-jerking) movies.But it was a slow night, nothing else to watch, except the same-o, same-o cop drama here and there,... so I braced myself for a boring and well-planned travel through sentimental-land, with all the buttons pushed at the right time, to force you to squeeze your tear ducts in your eyes.Mind you, I like everything that has Alan Rickman, Sigourney Weaver or Carrie-Anne Moss, in it, but I was wondering why these three would congregate to make a ""romantic drama"".At first, at the opening of the movie (a bit slow-paced for my taste), nothing new on the western horizon. Nice landscape, a diner and two odd characters meeting (one of them being Alan Rickman). Location? Canada. Season? Well, you may have guessed by the title, that it might be winter. Snow? Yes.A brief conversation, or better said, monologue of the two characters ensues. So far, so good.One might think at this point that that's it. Older man meets much younger woman and a pathetic story gets told once again. Wrong!What happens next, within the ten minute rule of movie-land (if nothing happens within a ten minute span, you can leave the theater or the room and switch off the TV). Well, as I was about to do so, lo and behold, Bang! Big Badda-Bing, Badda-Bang!A car crash! In a movie like this? Yes. A huge truck rams the man's car and this is the actual beginning of the picture.The rest unfolds while we accompany the man's ordeal through it all.I won't reveal what happens next because that's the part you absolutely have to watch for yourselves, and anything further would reveal the entire mystery of the plot. Yes, because the man has a secret, a terrible secret he is trying to keep at any cost.Suffice it to say that I as dumb as a bell. I missed it when showing in the theaters in 2006 and I could kick myself for this. How could I have missed a tiny gem like this? Then I remembered that I even missed ""Truly, Madly, Deeply"" many years before and had the same revelation on TV afterward. That teaches you only one thing. One never really learns from his own mistakes, at least not when one is as lazy and as jaded as I am...Let me just say that if you think to have known Sigourney Weaver as an actress before, well, think again... If you haven't seen her work in this movie, you simply cannot appreciate the great professional talent she has and the true gamut she can span when allowed to do so.Of course, she already revealed herself as a very skillful comedian in ""Galaxy Quest"" (also co-starring with Alan Rickman), but here she hits the high note of her entire career, blasting all the crystals in the house.She portrays and reproduces an autistic woman in every detail. So much so, that at times it becomes disturbing. It must have been the most difficult role she ever played. I am thinking about the research she had to undertake in order to slip in her role. I was astonished and very pleasantly surprised by her.Carrie-Anne Moss, is the romantic interest of Alan Rickman in this movie and one may believe that this is it... Again wrong! The woman can sparkle with just a few nuances, without ever stealing the show, but just because of this, she becomes an important and integral figure to the plot, without whom the outcome would be difficult to foresee. Her harsh traits, so well known in the ""Matrix"" movies, can reveal an astonishing feminine beauty, as well as a smile and a laughter that can carry you away to seventh heaven.Alan Rickman, the face of stone, or is it? I love him in everything he does. His wry, slashing, straight-face humor is simply unique and can be admired in so many movies. In ""Snow Cake"" he pushes the envelope further, always with very subtle touches, just like a few twitches of the eyes, a dismissing raising of an eyebrow, a touch of disappointment with the corner of the mouth. One has to closely watch the mechanics of his face to understand what a refined actor this man is.What can I say of Emily Hampshire, except maybe that she will make a terrific career for herself along the years? It is not easy to be the center of a movie without being in it throughout the story. Yet, this is exactly what she manages to do. Her looks, the way she played her role, the entire aura that she manages to broadly paint before our own eyes of who she is and what she does, cannot so simply be forgotten. In fact, her ghost image keeps on coming back in our own minds every time someone mentions her. It's just like saying: ""Don't think Elephant!"" and keeping seeing the elephant in our minds.Of course much credit goes to the casting of this movie. All characters must have been painstakingly be chosen and hand picked. But especially the role that Emily Hampshire had to cover, must have had that special attention, because if this role fails, the entire movie's construct falls apart and crashes miserably.I must also mention the screenplay and the editing of this movie, without which we would not be sitting here, me writing this, and you reading it. The screenplay must have been very special when handed to the actors, since they seem all so very comfortable with it (even though I realize that it must have been quite a study). The editing was made in such a way as never to bore the audience with useless details, but rather build story upon story, upon story, just to form a flowing river of information one can easily digest and admire.The director Marc Evans, must have had a hell of a time to coordinate the entire action and make sense of it all, but one can tell that he had confidence with the subject and manages to deliver a finished product that is a tiny masterpiece.I titled my review ""The science of forgiveness... and understanding."" and indeed that's the juice of this movie. It is much less a love story, than a human story, a story of human destinies clashing, bumping, crashing, landing, walking and ultimately explaining themselves through the art, or if you will, science of forgiveness and understanding. A lesson and a story we can all identify ourselves with.OK. Now that I have spent my time spending my Summa Cum Laude to these gifted actors and actresses, as well to all the off-screen personnel, I can only tell you one thing, if you think you know a movie by the title, or because you have read about it, well, think again. One must watch them before being able to judge them. Some may even reveal themselves as gems of movie making.""Snow Cake"" can certainly be considered one of them.Now to the DVD. I own both the UK pressed and the US version of this and I must say that both are worth owning. Despite the slight differences in color resolution and the obvious running length that varies due to the different PAL and NTSC frame speeds, nothing else can be said that would prevent you to buy this movie. The sound on both is crystal clear, and for once, may I add, you are not overwhelmed by intruding and pervasive music from wall to wall.There is music, but it is kept at a reasonable volume and not constant throughout the picture. For my understanding, this is a sure buy.",5,The science of forgiveness... and understanding.,1328054400,"02 1, 2012",2012,7203,"['Let', 'say', 'just', 'up', 'front', 'when', 'watched', 'television',

It almost felt like a documentary, rather than a fictional story--he is so real here.The story itself is beautiful. The Amazon review tells us that the writer has an autistic child so obviously this is an act of love for her. Despite the difficulties the people in the film face this isn't at all depressing. One is left with a huge amount of hope.  The scene in which the autistic woman. Linda, (Sigourney Weaver) and Alex  (Rickman) play scrabble is transcendent.  Linda makes up her own rules for the game which enable her to make up her own words, providing she can use them in a sentence.  The sentence she makes up (more than one...) is so beautiful, it will stay in my mind for a long time.  Weaver plays it just right.The film is so un-Hollywood it's terrifically refreshing.  The plot unfolds in surprising ways, just like life.  You don't know what's going to happen next, just like life.  Some may find the scenes with the autistic woman a little painful to watch; I did.

""It"" being, I assume, the usual heart warming effect of a tragedy redeemed by human goodness. Well, I guess the plot might lead one to look for that effect in that is is essentially about a ""full-of-life young woman killed senselessly and how those she had touched must deal with her loss.""But the real power of this film is that there is an organic unfolding of all the characters in gentle and satisfying ways. The Rickman character is ""redeemed"" in a slow and unremarkable way through his self deprecating courage, the Weaver character moves from a stereotypical persona to a complex human with her own way of grieving, and the Moss character evolves from an equally stereotypical persona to something almost sage-like. And all the supporting characters are equally satisfying in the way they start as ""type-cast"" elements and become real human beings by the end.There are salient moments which are not sappy or saccharine, and there are true insights into loss and the way life moves on, and the hope there is in imperfect people who never the less want to help each other.But the real wonder of the movie is the way these seasoned actors can take lines that could sound trite or cliche in the mouths of lesser actors and deliver them naturally and intimately and in so doing create a quiet dynamism that feels authentic and hopeful.I was surprised to find so many Amazon reviews of this low tempo film but I guess the big name actors and the quality of the direction worked together to create a real winner that obviously speaks to some core needs in us videophiles.I certainly need to hear/see more stories like this in which people, in all their ordinary uniqueness, connect and relate in a way that celebrates our humanity without being predictable and formulaic. I think that is what I liked most about the film. Numerous times I thought, ""oh, here comes the scene were such and such happens,"" and it didn't, I was wrong.

The crash that killed her wasn't Alex's fault--a semi driver rammed his car and killed her.Not knowing what else to do, Alex went to see Vivienne's Mom (Weaver) only to find that she was a high functioning autistic person with no one to care for her.  Alex stayed til the funeral was over--and those days really are what the story is about.Alex merely wants to help.  While he doesn't understand Linda's condition, he very well knows the grief of losing a child and by helping her he is also working through his own issues.  Rickman's portrayal of Alex may well be his best role in his career--and I have loved his performances for many years.Weaver is also stellar as Linda.  If I didn't know better, I would have said they'd recruited an autistic woman to play the role--and that to me, is the mark of really fine acting.  The actor is lost when they become the part.I cannot say this is a movie I would ever own.

1079659,A19ZXK9HHVRV1X,B000R7HY00,Roland E. Zwick,"[2, 3]","""Snow Cake"" starts off with a jolt of bitterly cruel irony, as a young hitchhiker, desperate to get home to her mother's, scans an Ontario diner to see which of its numerous patrons would be the ""safest"" person to ask for a ride.  She quickly alights on Alex Hughes, a reserved, colorless, middle-aged Brit who's come to Canada on some undisclosed business and who seems to be covering up some deep dark secret from the rest of the world.  Alex reluctantly agrees to take Vivienne with him, but before they can reach their destination, Vivienne is killed when the car they are riding in is sideswiped by a speeding semi.  Wracked with guilt, Alex decides to visit Vivienne's mother, Linda, and apologize for his part in the girl's death.  When he gets to the woman's home, he is shocked to discover that Linda is suffering from a case of autism so severe that she essentially lives in a world of her own, emotionally cut off from the people around her.Lyrical and low-keyed, ""Snow Cake"" paints an intriguing portrait of a woman trapped inside a dysfunctional mind and of a man coping with the crushing burden of survivor's guilt.  Yet, that is not the only problem Alex faces, for, despite the fact that he is in full control of his mental faculties, Alex is not all that far removed from Linda in his inability to make sense out of the world and to establish emotional connections with the people in his life.  Alex carries his sadness around with him like a dark cloud, alerting all who meet him to the extreme unhappiness buried deep within his soul.  Somehow, Alex and Linda establish a bizarre symbiotic relationship that few others in the movie can even begin to understand.Angela Bell's debut screenplay boasts a fine blend of sadness, humor and warmth, and Marc Evans' artful, sensitive direction creates a richly melancholic tone throughout.  Going far beyond the mannerisms of a mentally-challenged individual, Sigourney Weaver is poignant and touching as the woman cut off from the outside world, while the always wonderful Alan Rickman, with his hangdog expression and exasperated tone, conveys all the suppressed longing and world-weary resignation essential to his character.  In addition, Carrie-Anne Moss makes her mark as a well-meaning neighbor who offers Alan more than the traditional tea and sympathy in his time there.",4,thoughtful and thought-provoking,1207094400,"04 2, 2008",2008,2340,"['Snow', 'Cake', 'jolt', 'bitterly', 'cruel', 'irony', 'young', 'hitchhiker', 'desperate', 'get', 'home', 'mother', 'Ontario', 'diner', 'see', 'numerous', 'patrons', 'would', 'be', 'safest', 'person', 'ask', 'ride', 'quickly', 'alights', 'Alex', 'Hughes', 'reserved', 'colorless', 'middle-aged', 'Brit', 'who', 'come', 'Canada', 'undisclosed', 'business', 'who', 'be', 'covering', 'up', 'deep', 'dark', 'secret', 'rest', 'world', 'Alex', 'reluctantly', 'take', 'Vivienne', 'can', 'reach', 'destination', 'Vivienne', 'killed', 'when', 'car', 'are', 'riding', 'sideswiped', 'speeding', 'semi', 'Wracked', 'guilt', 'Alex', 'visit', 'Vivienne', 'mother', 'Linda', 'apologize', 'part', 'girl', 'death', 'When', 'woman', 'home', 'shocked', 'discover', 'Linda', 'suffering', 'case', 'autism', 'so', 'severe', 'essentially', 'world', 'own', 'emotionally', 'cut', 'off', 'people', 'her.Lyrical', 'low-keyed', 'Snow', 'Cake', 'intriguing', 'portrait', 'woman', 'trapped', 'dysfunctional', 'mind', 'man', 'coping', 'crushing', 'burden', 'survivor', 'guilt', 'not', 'only', 'problem', 'Alex', 'fact', 'full', 'control', 'mental', 'faculties', 'Alex', 'not', 'far', 'removed', 'Linda', 'inability', 'make', 'sense', 'world', 'establish', 'emotional', 'connections', 'people', 'life', 'Alex', 'sadness', 'dark', 'cloud', 'alerting', 'who', 'meet', 'extreme', 'unhappiness', 'buried', 'deep', 'soul', 'Somehow', 'Alex', 'Linda', 'establish', 'bizarre', 'symbiotic', 'relationship', 'few', 'others', 'movie', 'can', 'even', 'begin', 'understand.Angela', 'Bell', 'debut', 'screenplay', 'fine', 'blend', 'sadness', 'humor', 'warmth', 'Marc', 'Evans', 'artful', 'sensitive', 'direction', 'richly', 'melancholic', 'tone', 'Going', 'far', 'mannerisms', 'mentally-challenged', 'individual', 'Sigourney', 'Weaver', 'poignant', 'touching', 'woman', 'cut', 'off', 'outside', 'world', 'always', 'wonderful', 'Alan', 'Rickman', 'hangdog', 'expression', 'exasperated', 'tone', 'conveys', 'suppressed', 'longing', 'world-weary', 'resignation', 'essential', 'character', 'addition', 'Carrie-Anne', 'Moss', 'mark', 'well-meaning', 'neighbor', 'who', 'Alan', 'more', 'traditional', 'tea', 'sympathy', 'time', 'there']",N/A

Marking the screenwriting debut of Angela Pell, it was directed by Marc Evans and screened to heavy fanfare at the 2006 Toronto International Film Festival and is at last available on DVD for a wider audience to appreciate.Fresh off a four year prison stint for a mysterious murder charge, Alex Hughes, played by the fantastic Alan Rickman, is a docile, middle-aged Englishman on the way to Winnipeg, Canada. Not receptive to company after a long plane ride, he is approached in a diner by Vivienne, a young woman with a bubbly personality played by Emily Hampshire. Chatty and extroverted, she invites herself to sit down at his table and tells him all about herself. He is not in the mood to chat, but begrudgingly lets her bum a ride in his truck.During their trip she eventually gets him to open up, and they establish a lovely rapport. Unfortunately, near the end of their journey they are rammed by a tractor trailer and Vivienne is killed instantly. Rattled and wholly devastated at her loss, Alex is compelled to contact her mother, Linda, played with unprecedented skill by Sigourney Weaver, to explain what happened as well as deliver gifts Vivienne bought.When he meets Linda, he discovers that she is a high-functioning autistic woman who barely strays from her home and has a myriad of obsessions, among them cleanliness (""Don't go in my kitchen!""), her trampoline and, strangely, snow. Nonetheless upset at her daughter's death, she is inhibited by her disease which tempers her outward devastation. He tries to apologize, but she sees no need for one.""Did you do it in purpose?"" she asks him.""No, of course not, we just...""""Then sit down then! I haven't got a problem with you - you must be alright because you gave Vivienne a lift, and you brought me my sparklies!"" she says as she plays with them excitedly.Linda persuades him to stay to assist her with funeral arrangements and put out the garbage on Tuesday (""I don't do garbage!""), as her parents are hiking in the mountains and cannot be reached to come to her assistance. Little does Alex know that he is embarking what are likely to be the defining days of his life.He becomes involved with Linda's beautiful though equally mysterious neighbor Maggie, played by Carrie-Anne Moss, and is viewed with a watchful eye by the local townspeople, most particularly Clyde, a local police officer with eyes for Maggie played by James Allodi who digs into his troubled past. Getting to know more about Vivienne and her life, Alex learns even more about himself in the process.""Vivienne wanted to be a writer,"" Linda tells him. ""She said she would always try and get a ride with the most lonely looking characters because they had the best stories."" As it turns out, it is her own death that proves the turning point in Alex's own story. A man trying to escape his past, he soon realizes through his experiences that the only way he can move on with his life is to confront his demons head on.Rickman is positively endearing, with an innate ability to make viewers care for his protagonist, and Weaver's nuanced, challenging performance is simply a marvel of acting dexterity. Although she plays the kind of woman most go out of their way to avoid interacting with, she fully humanizes Linda and brings the viewer into her own little world where emotions are blunt and eating snow is a thrilling occasion. An unlikely angel, she facilitates Alex's need to move on to the next chapter of his life.""Snow Cake"" is certainly offbeat, but it is a deeply affecting film made to linger on the viewer's palette long after its viewing.

The opening scene of him airborne imparts the persona well - yet he's only sitting there, not even looking out the window. Alex Hughes is a  con, who ""killed a man"".  He's accosted by a young woman in a diner claiming he ""looks like he needs to talk"", something he rejects.  It's Northern Ontario in early winter - not the most attractive season but highly fitting.  Vivienne is an aspiring writer wanting to know about people.  She's cut off in that youth by a semi-truck who sends Alex's car flying into the snow.  Beset by guilt, he wends his way to Wawa, an isolated community along the Transcanada Highway to confront Vivienne's mother with unneeded apologies.Linda [Weaver] greets him with total indifference.  Vivienne is gone and there's nothing more to be done.  She's autistic, with many of the symptoms portrayed by an actress who's clearly researched the syndrome.  Subject to obsessions, given to outbursts over what are mundane circumstances to the rest of us, Weaver performs impeccably in the role.  ""I don't do garbage"", she says, urging him to stay to move the bins to the street on Tuesday.  Reluctantly, he agrees, perceiving Linda's state requires no little compassion.  She has nobody else to rely on, keeping her distance from her neighbours in town - especially Maggie - ""she's a prostitute"", says Linda.There are neither lapses nor ""hanging"" scenes in this film.  Every frame carries the message of a man beset by grief.  The prison sentence was from his wreaking vengeance on the man who, while driving drunk, had struck Alex's son, killing him.  Rickman carries this film throughout, Weaver, for all her abilities in portraying Linda, remains yet a foil to a man so riven by grief and guilt.  Unlike Linda, who must be accommodated, Alex must endure a painful healing process.  It has already been long and painful, and there's no assurance that even the meeting of his former wife in distant Winnipeg will relieve him of his woes.  That situation keeps the film heavy, but the performances make it more than bearable, it's compelling.  Carrie-Anne Moss brings a particular strength in a small town as a woman sexually driven, but is in no way hackneyed in her role as Maggie.Throughout the film Rickman is the balance point of many forces, his own anguish, Linda's bizarre lapses into her own world and Maggie's need for a man she can respect.  A post-accident confrontation with the truck driver brings a turning point - Alex, who has feelings in check is given the opportunity to vent them fully.  Does he achieve release?  Death, to him, is a very significant presence, yet Linda simply asserts that ""We won't see Vivienne again"", a more rational approach than being suffused by crippling sadness.  All we come to believe about Alex is confronted by his departure ""gift"" to Linda, a masterful departure from the grim man we've come to know.  The film could have been terribly hackneyed, but Marc Evans has managed a low-key masterpiece.

1079665,A18GP1PWVTKXQQ,B000R7HY00,Turfseer,"[3, 6]","*** This review may contain spoilers ***Snow Cake is a Canadian film which had many more favorable reviews than negative one's. I believe there is little argument that it was Sigourney Weaver's performance that drew people to the film, resulting in all the accolades. And I would agree that the single most compelling aspect of the film is the multi-layered character that Weaver plays: 'Linda', a fully functioning adult autistic woman. Linda seemed pretty believable to me as Weaver captures both the childlike simplicity of the character as well as the torment. The screenwriter, Angela Pell, certainly knows something about autism, since she raised an autistic son.What's fascinating about Linda is that her emotional life is so bifurcated. On one hand, she's a simple child who is intimately connected to nature--the snow cake symbolizing the connection she feels to the earth--perhaps her greatest joy is to experience the snow melting in her mouth. But on the other hand, as an adult, she's unable to let herself be intimate with anyone who seeks to get close to her. She creates boundaries, such as not allowing anyone into her kitchen; and like all those who suffer from severe obsessive-compulsive disorder, resorts to maintaining order in the environment, in order to avoid contact with those who attempt to form a relationship with her. Even when she allows someone to touch her (when, for example, she asks Alex to 'hug' her), she insists that he wrap his arms around her without using his hands. There is an additional aspect that makes Linda such a rich character: her creativity. One of the most enjoyable moments in the film is when she plays scrabble with Alex, using only made-up words.Vivienne, Linda's daughter, is also another fascinating character who we only meet briefly at the beginning of the film as she's soon killed in the accident. Rather than viewing Vivienne as having been ""damaged"" by the lack of a 'normal' mother figure, she's actually a young woman who's learned to cope in the face of a difficult upbringing. What's more, she's incorporated the positive, creative aspects of her mother's personality that makes her so endearing. Another very powerful moment in the film, is the father's eulogy of Vivienne, in which he conveys the strength of her character and the enormous sense of loss as a result of her tragic death.Pell is less successful with the other characters in her film. Alex is also supposed to be 'damaged goods' as we eventually learn of his back story: he killed the man responsible for the death of the son he was on his way to meet for the first time. It's obvious why Pell has the emotionally stunted Alex on his way to a first meeting and not having met the son before: by depriving Alex of meeting the son, he loses his mind and kills the victim (a drunk driver) in a fit of rage. I wanted to find out more about Alex--instead , he's pretty much depicted as a one-note character, severely depressed due to his earlier loss of control as well as guilt over the death of Vivienne.Alex overcomes his depression by reaching out and helping Linda. But he also moves forward through his relationship with Maggie, perhaps the least convincing character in the film. I just didn't get why Maggie would jump into bed so fast with Alex or why she's attracted to him at all. After all, it's not like she hasn't had other men in her life. What's more, she has no idea who this Alex character is. On the surface, it's obvious he's depressed. Maggie is the artificial love interest that also serves as an impetus to repair Alex's damaged soul. Indie dramas are littered with these saintly characters with their perennial 'hearts of gold'!Aside from the saintly Maggie and Alex, along with Linda's loving parents, most of the rest of the townspeople come off as wholly unsympathetic as they feign tolerance and sympathy for Linda but behind her back secretly have contempt for her. In one of the deleted scenes on the DVD, a woman comes up to Alex in a McDonald's and compliments Alex on the good job he's been doing with her; Alex turns around and slyly tells the woman that Linda is his wife! I'm not sure why the scene was deleted but perhaps the director sensed that it was too didactic: the 'moral' Alex must teach a lesson to one of the uncaring townspeople. The idea of a collective group of uncaring townspeople as the films' collective 'antagonist' doesn't work precisely people are much more complicated and nuanced as the film's scenarist suggests.This might seem odd, but the thing that bothered me most about 'Snow Cake' is the screenwriter's failure to explain the nature of the accident. Why is everything left so vague when the truck driver piles into Alex and Vivienne? Wouldn't the circumstances of the accident have been broadcast on the nightly news? By leaving the nature of the accident vague, this allows Alex to act with hostility toward the truck driver (barring him from bringing the flowers to Linda). But had Alex knew what really happened, he couldn't have used that as an excuse to be angry with the truck driver. The confrontation between the two seems forced and sets up the sentimental scene in the church where Alex 'forgives' the driver (which he has no right to do, since presumably the death of Vivienne was an accident!).As a psychological portrait of a fully functioning adult autistic woman and her quirky but vibrant teenage daughter, Snow Cake hits the mark. But most of the rest of the Snow Cake characters, particularly Maggie and Alex, never rise above the level of caricature. For all its well-meaning sensitivity, Snow Cake is more a fairy tale than a story that could actually happen in real life.",3,Weaver is great as a fully functioning adult autistic woman despite other

He perfects every performance, no matter the movie. Snow Cake is no exception. The film itself is on the slow side, and truly, not much happens. But it works because of the magnificent performances. Sigourney Weaver is truly great in the role of a high functioning autistic woman and Carrie-Anne Moss gives a small but interesting performance as the woman that attracts Alan's attention. The scenes between them made me forget exactly how old Alan Rickman is. Just hot.
