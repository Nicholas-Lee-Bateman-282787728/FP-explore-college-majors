976293,A3N8RZSXKN1OR2,B000EQ46H8,Chrijeff,"[2, 2]","1955 was the year when TV Westerns suddenly transformed from kiddie fare to ""adult,"" and this series, with James Arness's Gunsmoke, was one of the most important players in that change.  Originally one of three rotating series sharing the same time slot (which accounts for this set featuring only 15 segments), Cheyenne was also among the first in a long line of well-known and successful Warner Brothers oaters.  It's also intriguing that both it and GS should focus on a man of more than ordinary stature (Clint Walker was only an inch shorter than Arness).  Drifter Cheyenne Bodie, who got his nickname from having dwelt with the Cheyenne Indians from age 10 to 18 (at the end of that time he ""walked away with their blessings""), ranges from Mexico to Wyoming, doing free-lance freighting and working variously as a lawman, a cowhand, and a government scout; in the first few episodes (#1, 2, and 4 of the set) he's the guide for a Texan-born surveyor known as Smitty (L. Q. Jones), but later he becomes a loner.  Like other Westerns of its kind, the series often addresses such issues as loyalty (betrayal by someone Cheyenne trusts is at the core of two segments), the lingering wounds of the Civil War, and the ""savagery"" of Indians.  Walker (who was 28 when the series premiered) is perhaps not a great actor, but he has real presence, and the dialogue is well written (one of the writers was Alan LeMay, known as the author of the classic novelThe Searchers, and another segment appears to have been based on B. Traven'sThe Treasure of the Sierra Madre): Cheyenne may be laconic, but when he speaks it's memorably and to purpose.  And, like all the Westerns of its era, the series attracted a good roster of guest stars, including perpetual heavy Robert J. Wilkie, John Doucette, James Garner (who shows up no less than three times, twice as a Cavalry lieutenant, and who went on to fame in WB's series ""Maverick""), Ray Teal, Rod Taylor, Edward Andrews, Myron Healey, Leo Gordon, Dubb [sic] Taylor, Michael Landon (uncredited and looking about 15), Gerald Mohr, Trevor Bardette, Ralph Moody, Mort Mills (twice, once uncredited), Carlos Rivas (who went on to portray Lun Tha inThe King and I (50th Anniversary Edition)), Nancy Kulp, and Peggie Castle as Mary ""Mississippi"" Brown (she was eventually a regular on the WB series ""Lawman"").  It's not entirely clear when these adventures are happening: one episode takes place during the French Intervention in Mexico, another c. 1868, several probably 1872 or later, and in one we see a typewriter (the first commercially successful model of which began production in 1873)--but, as in other Western series likeThe Texan, the writers may simply be showing us random incidents from a long career.

No other actor could have brought the humble heroism, class and action to this role. Clint was the gentle giant who young boys of the '50's idolized and young girls dreamed of marrying. Clint's mannerism, acting style, voice and sheer size brought the Cheyenne character to life. This DVD is perfect for those of us old enough to remember the series and to those who we would like to introduce this series to. The best part of the DVD is the recent interview with Clint. Time has indeed taken its toll on this man who once looked looked like a Greek God, but its a joy seeing him for one more time. There are so many more questions that I wished had been asked  such as his interest in body building, his excperience in movies, why he felt his career did not take off as James Garner, Steve Mcqueen's etc, and how he spends his time today. Perhaps in future DVDs Clint might agree to sit down for a more extensive interview.

976297,A1YAFLTYMGX4SQ,B000EQ46H8,"D. Frame ""music lover""","[0, 0]","John who? Wayne what? Forget that cowboy! Clint Walker is the king of cowboys! I was born in 1961 but never watched many westerns. I have never been a huge fan of westerns on TV or the movies. Clint Walker changed all that. Well...I like his style of westerns anyway. I actually bought the first season years ago and set it aside. I finally started watching the episodes. Wow! I bought the first season of Cheyenne because I had seen Clint Walker in an old movie and was surprised at how much I enjoyed it. Not only does Clint Walker have understated charisma on both the small and large screens, the scripts of Cheyenne were very well written. In some cases, especially as the series continued in later years, I believe the scripts were ahead of their time. Yes, there was violence in the west. However, with Clint Walker's portrayal of the character Cheyenne there seems to be the lesson that violence should not be the first answer to the problem. He always tried to find another solution to the problem. But, when it was necessary, nobody could beat Cheyenne. I am in the process of purchasing every Cheyenne season and every Clint Walker movie available on Amazon. Everyone who loves westerns seems to idolize John Wayne. I am in no way going to speak poorly of Mr. Wayne. However, Mr. Walker is, by far, the better of the two in my opinion. He should have been a much bigger star in later years than he was. If you like westerns or if you like Clint Walker and if you want TV viewing that anyone in your family can watch from young to young-at-heart, then the entire Cheyenne series should be in your DVD library while you can still get them.

Cheyenne was one of the first -- and definitely one of the best -- series in this golden era of westerns.

I'd never seen Cheyenne before (I think it was relegated to afternoon tv here in New Zealand) - what gets me is how well the episodes are put together. Unlike many hour long shows before the days of multiple storylines, this one doesn't seem padded out (compared with The Big Valley which I purchased at the same time - man, those ones drag). The action moves long at a fair old clip. True, they've taken lots of stock footage from Warner Brothers movies - and even plots are lifted wholesale (Rocky Mountain, Treasure of the Sierra Madre etc etc). But the stock footage, on the whole, blends in quite nicely, and the action scenes shot specially for the show hold up very well (the Indian attack on the mountain fortress in the very first episode is as good as anything you'd find in a B western). Clint Walker may not be the greatest actor, but he exudes honesty and integrity - which is really all that the role requires. And what a roster of guest stars - three episodes down and Ray Teal, James Garner, Robert Wilkie, Rod Taylor, Edward Andrews and John Doucette have all made appearances. I love this set (in case you haven't already guessed). Great, undemanding fun with good production values (while the scripts may not be as classy as Have Gun Will Travel, the production looks one heck of a lot better).  The documentary with Clint Walker is nothing startling, but it's pleasant to see the guy talking about how he got into the show and relating some behind the scenes stories. Picture and audio quality is on the whole excellent. And yes, I got the new slimline packaging, so storage ain't a problem. Well done Warners. can't wait for season two (although was that the one with Ty Hardin after Clint Walker left due to an argument over contracts?).",4,"Tight, exciting little b westerns",1152057600,"07 5, 2006",2006,1882,"['Okay', ""'ll"", 'admit', ""'ve"", 'only', 'watched', 'three', 'so', 'far', 'rest', 'series', 'are', ""'m"", 'winner', ""'d"", 'never', 'seen', 'Cheyenne', 'think', 'was', 'relegated', 'afternoon', 'tv', 'here', 'New', 'Zealand', 'what', 'how', 'well', 'episodes', 'are', 'put', 'together', 'many', 'hour', 'long', 'days', 'multiple', 'storylines', 'one', ""n't"", 'seem', 'padded', 'out', 'compared', 'Big', 'Valley', 'purchased', 'same', 'time', 'man', 'ones', 'drag', 'action', 'long', 'fair', 'old', 'clip', 'True', ""'ve"", 'taken', 'lots', 'stock', 'footage', 'Warner', 'Brothers', 'movies', 'even', 'plots', 'are', 'lifted', 'wholesale', 'Rocky', 'Mountain', 'Treasure', 'Sierra', 'Madre', 'etc', 'etc', 'stock', 'footage', 'whole', 'quite', 'nicely', 'action', 'scenes', 'shot', 'specially', 'show', 'hold', 'up', 'very', 'well', 'Indian', 'attack', 'mountain', 'fortress', 'very', 'first', 'episode', 'as', 'good', 'anything', ""'d"", 'find', 'B', 'western', 'Clint', 'Walker', 'may', 'not', 'be', 'greatest', 'actor', 'honesty', 'integrity', 'really', 'role', 'what', 'roster', 'guest', 'stars', 'three', 'episodes', 'down', 'Ray', 'Teal', 'James', 'Garner', 'Robert', 'Wilkie', 'Rod', 'Taylor', 'Edward', 'Andrews', 'John', 'Doucette', 'have', 'made', 'appearances', 'love', 'set', 'case', 'have', ""n't"", 'already', 'guessed', 'Great', 'undemanding', 'fun', 'good', 'production', 'values', 'scripts', 'may', 'not', 'be', 'as', 'classy', 'Have', 'Gun', 'Will', 'Travel', 'production', 'one', 'heck', 'lot', 'better', 'documentary', 'Clint', 'Walker', 'nothing', 'startling', 'pleasant', 'see', 'guy', 'talking', 'how', 'got', 'show', 'relating', 'scenes', 'stories', 'Picture', 'audio', 'quality', 'whole', 'excellent', 'yes', 'got', 'new', 'slimline', 'packaging', 'so', 'storage', 'ai', ""n't"", 'problem', 'Well', 'done', 'Warners', 'ca', ""n't"", 'wait', 'season', 'two', 'was', 'one', 'Ty', 'Hardin', 'Clint', 'Walker', 'left', 'due', 'argument', 'contracts']",CHEYENNE SEASON 1 (FF)(DVD)(3PK)

Only the first set was in good condition.  When I started viewing sets 2, 3, and 4, virtually every one had severe problems - no sounds, damaged picture - virtually unwatchable.  The person who remastered this either didn't check the other sets or hoped the purchaser would not go past Set One until it was too late to return.  Shameful quality, absolutely shameful.  You would do better to purchase this from Walker's own website.I was a child when this series debuted, and while I did remember being aware of Clint Walker's astonishing physical presence even as a five-year-old female, I didn't remember much else.  Imagine my surprise, upon taking a chance on this set, to find that these were well-scripted, well-acted, at times even touching programs.  Yes, several Old Western Movie cliches are present, most notably last-minute rescues by the Cavalry, constant attacks by screaming Indians, good girl/bad girl stereotypes, always-unshaven villains (you can spot them a mile away), and lots of killin'.  However, offsetting these are the hero's sensitivity, without sentimentality, to the plight of the Indians by this point in time; a reluctance to kill unless pushed to the wall; and a respectful gentleness toward all women, ""good"" or ""bad"". Walker imbues Cheyenne Bodie with great decency without seeming preachy or mealymouthed. In fact, Walker himself is one-quarter Cherokee and he is married to a Native American woman.  Fine performers show up in their salad days, such as the always delightful James Garner (he appears in several of these episodes) and a handsome young Rod Taylor (whose bare chest gives Clint's a run for its money, no mean feat!). It is fun watching and suddenly saying, ""Why, isn't that so and so when s/he was really young?!""  You remember how important early television was to the careers of so many who went on to films or to television shows of their own (Garner went on to ""Maverick"" and thence to movie fame, Taylor to a movie career, etc.)These shows are, it is true, somewhat dated, but they are not without merit.  Listening to Walker gently reassuring a terrified woman returning to white society after six years of captivity with the Kiowa that she will not revolt white men, and comparing this with the parade of sadistic violence toward and humiliation of women that permeates today's television shows, I felt a real sense of affection and loss.  If you don't have a feeling for the west these may not interest you.  But if you do, or if you were one of those children whose families sat around in the evening together and watched these shows in the 1950s, I think you will enjoy this set, for itself and for the lost era in which the shows emerged.

976324,A25QRJQWIAUICD,B000EQ46H8,Luiz A. Sampaio,"[64, 67]","Warner Bros is riding towards the right direction. The release of the First Season of Cheyenne is not only a wise decision of the studio, but also an essencial one. Cheyenne was the show that led Warner Brothers to be one of the biggest companies producing television series. Cheyenne was the very beginning for the studio, and it was, and still is, an important part in television history. Along with Gunsmoke, Cheyenne established the pattern for other western series to come out of Warner Bros and other studios. Clint Walker was not a good actor, but his massive physical building and his soft way of speaking were perfect for a rugged hero of a western show and he became one of the most remarkable television stars for the genre.The first season of Cheyenne, in spite of being excellent, was not the best one. The episodes ran a bit shorter because Warner used the final minutes for a ""behind-the-scenes"", promoting the studio movies. And that pleasing song by William Lava and Stan Jones was absent. Unfortunately the first season had only 15 episodes. Nevertheless, this DVD box is a must for anybody who wants to get in touch with old television shows and learn how good and attractive they were. Let's enjoy the first season of Cheyenne, and hope that Warner Bros releases the second, the third and so on.",5,A Great Western Show on DVD,1144108800,"04 4, 2006",2006,1315,"['Warner', 'Bros', 'riding', 'right', 'direction', 'release', 'First', 'Season', 'Cheyenne', 'not', 'only', 'wise', 'decision', 'studio', 'also', 'essencial', 'one', 'Cheyenne', 'was', 'show', 'led', 'Warner', 'Brothers', 'be', 'one', 'biggest', 'companies', 'producing', 'television', 'series', 'Cheyenne', 'was', 'very', 'beginning', 'studio', 'was', 'still', 'important', 'part', 'television', 'history', 'Gunsmoke', 'Cheyenne', 'established', 'pattern', 'other', 'western', 'series', 'come', 'Warner', 'Bros', 'other', 'studios', 'Clint', 'Walker', 'was', 'not', 'good', 'actor', 'massive', 'physical', 'building', 'soft', 'way', 'speaking', 'were', 'perfect', 'rugged', 'hero', 'western', 'show', 'became', 'one', 'most', 'remarkable', 'television', 'stars', 'genre.The', 'first', 'season', 'Cheyenne', 'spite', 'being', 'excellent', 'was', 'not', 'best', 'one', 'episodes', 'ran', 'bit', 'shorter', 'Warner', 'used', 'final', 'minutes', 'behind-the-scenes', 'promoting', 'studio', 'movies', 'pleasing', 'song', 'William', 'Lava', 'Stan', 'Jones', 'was', 'absent', 'Unfortunately', 'first', 'season', 'had', 'only', '15', 'episodes', 'Nevertheless', 'DVD', 'box', 'must', 'anybody', 'who', 'get', 'touch', 'old', 'television', 'shows', 'learn', 'how', 'good', 'attractive', 'were', 'Let', 'enjoy', 'first', 'season', 'Cheyenne', 'hope', 'Warner', 'Bros', 'second', 'third', 'so']",CHEYENNE SEASON 1 (FF)(DVD)(3PK)
976325,AYNRYB9OK06P1,B000EQ46H8,Mad Mau,"[17, 18]","I guess I'm just not picky enough to be a good critic of Television DVD releases.  I bought the first season of Cheyenne and have just finished watching a couple of episodes.  I enjoyed them very, very much.The packaging is not space age high tech; but had eye appeal and appeared totally functional.The video transfer is not the most ultimately remastered, highest definition transfer on the planet; but was clear and perfectly viewable.The audio wasn't high definition 5.1 Dolby Surround; but came through loud and clear with the dialogue easily discerned, even for my 50 year old ears.The stories in the first season of Cheyenne were well written and filmed with high standards.  (Although some of the lines in the stories will make you chuckle and now seem cliched, we must remember this was 50 years ago and they were new then and reflected the current moral climate.)So while this first season release isn't perfect, it's highly recommended.  What is perfect about Cheyenne, however is the presence of Clint Walker.  Let's face it, Clint Walker is ""Cheyenne""!  He certainly wasn't the greatest actor to ever grace the small screen, but he had a quiet, almost brooding machismo; offering a towering physical presence, combined with an almost gentle elegance.  Honor and dignity oozed from Cheyenne.  (Geeze, sounds like I have a Man Crush on Cheyenne - so be it.)By the way, the extra features don't abound but there is a nice, recent interview with Clint Walker, wherein he tells the story of how he got into acting and landing the part of Cheyenne.  Clint still comes across as an honest, gentle, caring man.  One of the true nice guys that came out of Hollywood.To close, let me add that Cheyenne is good wholesome entertainment, filled with stories of honor, redemption and courage.  And believe it or not, the good guys finish first and the bad guys get what they deserve.",5,Clint Walker - One of the good guys,1149724800,"06 8, 2006",2006,1882,"['guess', ""'m"", 'just', 'not', 'picky', 'enough', 'be', 'good', 'critic', 'Television', 'DVD', 'bought', 'first', 'season', 'Cheyenne', 'have', 'just', 'finished', 'watching', 'couple', 'episodes', 'enjoyed', 'very', 'very', 'much.The', 'packaging', 'not', 'space', 'age', 'high', 'tech', 'had', 'eye', 'appeal', 'appeared', 'totally', 'functional.The', 'video', 'transfer', 'not', 'most', 'ultimately', 'remastered', 'highest', 'definition', 'transfer', 'planet', 'was', 'clear', 'perfectly', 'viewable.The', 'audio', 'was', ""n't"", 'high', 'definition', '5.1', 'Dolby', 'Surround', 'came', 'loud', 'clear', 'dialogue', 'easily', 'discerned', 'even', '50', 'year', 'old', 'ears.The', 'stories', 'first', 'season', 'Cheyenne', 'were', 'well', 'written', 'filmed', 'high', 'standards', 'lines', 'stories', 'will', 'make', 'chuckle', 'now', 'seem', 'cliched', 'must', 'remember', 'was', '50', 'years', 'ago', 'were', 'new', 'then', 'reflected', 'current', 'moral', 'climate', 'So', 'first', 'season', 'release', ""n't"", 'perfect', 'highly', 'recommended', 'What', 'perfect', 'Cheyenne', 'however', 'presence', 'Clint', 'Walker', 'Let', 'face', 'Clint', 'Walker', 'Cheyenne', 'certainly', 'was', ""n't"", 'greatest', 'actor', 'ever', 'grace', 'small', 'screen', 'had', 'quiet', 'almost', 'brooding', 'machismo', 'offering', 'towering', 'physical', 'presence', 'combined', 'almost', 'gentle', 'elegance', 'Honor', 'dignity', 'oozed', 'Cheyenne', 'Geeze', 'have', 'Man', 'Crush', 'Cheyenne', 'so', 'be', 'way', 'extra', 'features', 'do', ""n't"", 'abound', 'nice', 'recent', 'interview', 'Clint', 'Walker', 'wherein', 'story', 'how', 'got', 'acting', 'landing', 'part', 'Cheyenne', 'Clint', 'still', 'across', 'honest', 'gentle', 'caring', 'man', 'One', 'true', 'nice', 'guys', 'came', 'Hollywood.To', 'close', 'let', 'add', 'Cheyenne', 'good', 'wholesome', 'entertainment', 'filled', 'stories', 'honor', 'redemption', 'courage', 'believe', 'not', 'good', 'guys', 'finish', 'first', 'bad', 'guys', 'get', 'what', 'deserve']",CHEYENNE SEASON 1 (FF)(DVD)(3PK)

I watch my favorite shows while on the treadmill (I know, too much information) and was enjoying the first episode although perplexed by the soundless introduction (""Warner Brothers Presents:). Warner Brothers claims to be ""The First In Sound"" and on shows a few years later over the same visual of the Warner Brothers sound stages the announcer intoned: ""FROM THE ENTERTAINMENT CAPITAL OF THE WORLD, PRODUCED FOR TELEVISION BY WARNER BROTHERS""....Well now I am watching and enjoying the first episode. I've never seen it in syndication. A typical episode from syndication is around 50 minutes long and as the episode ended and I looked at the timer on the treadmill it read...40 MINUTES!!!. What happened? What got ""CHOPPED""? Was I robbed?...After some simple research I discovered that ""Cheyenne"" was one of 3 shows under the umbrella of ""Warner Brothers Presents"" which premiered on ABC in September of 1955. The show was narrated by Gig Young and at the end of the episode featured 10 to 15 minutes of previews of Warner Brothers movies. What a treasure trove of movie history that is sitting somewhere other than on the video I purchased in good faith.. I GOT ROBBED MISTER!!! No Gig Young, No 15 minutes of previews. Thankfully one of my favorite television weaver of tales, Roy Huggins, produced the first year and even wrote an episode. What happened to ""Honest"" product descriptions. I would still have purchased this set and then not feel I was being ""ROBBED"" every time I watched it. I will bet you anything that over the desk of the head of Warner Brothers is a cartton cell of Daffy Duck yelling ""MINE, MINE, MINE! right next to a cell of Bugs Bunny counting money and saying ""One for you and three for me, SUCKER!"".",4,HEY  SUCKER!

976336,A3RUSD36FWAGGD,B000EQ46H8,Moon Mist,"[120, 124]","I have about 25 VHS tapes full of episodes of ""Cheyenne"" that I have taped off of the Good Life TV Network, where it aired from the late 1990's prime time and occasionally on weekend afternoons as well.  The episodes were introduced by George Clooney's father, Nick, who usually gave a bit of trivia about the episode, the star, Clint Walker, or one of the many guest stars.  As of 2004, the last time I had access to the channel, Clooney was still on the network, introducing ""Cheyenne"", as well as the other great black & white Warner Brothers westerns from the 1950's and early 1960's, like ""Bronco"" and ""Maverick"".  The network also showed ""Sugarfoot"" and ""Lawman"", but only on weekends without Clooney's introductions.""Cheyenne"" remains my favorite of the old WB westerns, with Clint Walker a very unusual western star, given his immense size.  One might wonder why any character would have dared to give him a hard time, but they did, and usually ended up worse for the wear.  ""Bronco"" took over, off and on during Walker's lawsuit against WB.  I enjoyed that one, too, as it had a lot of action.  But Clint is the man, and I'm glad to see this series reaching DVD.The first season does not feature the familiar theme song, which I believe does not appear until the second season.  The first season theme song is pretty unmemorable, so be prepared for that.  Also, you will find the first few shows of the series to be featuring character actor L.Q. Jones as ""Smitty"", Cheyenne Bodie's somewhat humorous sidekick.  Jones is priceless in his own right and one of my favorite western character actors.  However, this is Clint's gig, and the producers of the series soon found that out and the Smitty character is gone by the second season.  So if you are a fan of the series or good TV westerns, this set is worth it, but in my opinion, the series got even better in the second season and beyond.And just a note on ""Maverick"", which will likely be following soon on DVD.  In my humble opinion, the opposite is true.  My favorite season of ""Maverick"" is the first season, because I am more of a fan of action in a western than humor, and James Garner's first-season Bret Maverick is a more serious and kick-ass hero than in later seasons, where he loosens up a bit and the happy-go-lucky Maverick most people know and love gradually appears.  Also, the vocal version (with words) of the great ""Maverick"" theme song does not appear in the first season. It's the same melody, but instrumental.  In nearly all cases in nearly all of these great WB westerns, any vocal theme song appears only over the ending credits, not at the beginning.

976341,AYU9LBROYQBG6,B000EQ46H8,"Noel Serrano ""Gala Foundation http://gfoundat...","[6, 7]","Cheyenne is a western television series of 108 black-and-white episodes broadcast on ABC from 1955 to 1962. The show was the first hour-long western, the first series to be made by a major Hollywood film studio which did not derive from its established film properties,[4] and the first of a long chain of Warner Brothers original series produced by William T. Orr.The series strength was its charismatic star and TV western icon, Clint Walker, who dominated the screen with his powerful physique. Off the set, Walker battled the studio over his contract, making Cheyenne one of the more tempestuous productions in the history of television.The series began as a part of Warner Brothers Presents, a program that alternated three different series in rotation. In its first year, Cheyenne traded broadcast weeks with Casablanca and King's Row. Thereafter, Cheyenne was overhauled by outgoing producer Roy Huggins and left the umbrella of WBP. The show starred Clint Walker as Cheyenne Bodie, a physically huge cowboy wandering the Old West. The show ran from 1955 to 1963, except for a hiatus when Walker went on strike for higher pay (1958-1959). The interim saw the introduction of a virtual Bodie-clone called Bronco Layne, played by Ty Hardin. Hardin was featured as the quasi main character during Bodie's absence. When Warners renegotiated Walker's contract and the actor returned to the show in 1959, Bronco was spunoff as a show in its own right and became independently successful.The two series alternated in the same time slot from 1958 to 1962, with Bronco as the junior partner (only a snippet of his theme song was heard in the opening credits, as a kind of aural footnote to Cheyenne's). Occasionally both Cheyenne and Bronco appeared together in the same episode, both deadly serious as they worked together.At the conclusion of the sixth season, a special episode was aired. Called ""A Man Named Ragan"", it was a pilot for a program called The Dakotas that would replace Cheyenne in the middle of the next season. However, because Cheyenne Bodie never appeared in ""Ragan"", the two programs are only tenuously linked.[2]Walker reprised the Cheyenne Bodie character in 1991 for the TV-movie The Gambler Returns: Luck of the Draw and also played Cheyenne in an episode of Kung Fu: The Legend Continues in 1995.For the 1957-58 season, ABC offered to purchase a full season of thirty-nine episodes of Cheyenne. Warner Brothers declined, however, since each hour-long episode took six working days for principal photography alone. The studio couldn't supply a new episode each week. Because Walker appeared in virtually every scene, it was also impossible to shoot more than one episode at a time.[5]Cheyenne Bodie, a former frontier scout, is the heroic loner who drifts without any particular motivation or purpose through the old West after the Civil War taking temporary jobs on ranches, wagon trains, or cattle drives. Sometimes he works for the federal government or finds himself deputized by local lawmen. He often meddles in the affairs of others, settling conflicts with his fists and guns rather than with his wits, mediation, conciliation, or persuasion. Producers changed Bodie's circumstances at will in order to insert him into any dramatic conflict. Several Cheyenne episodes were remakes of earlier Warner Brothers movies like To Have and Have Not (1944) and Treasure of the Sierra Madre (1948) with Cheyenne Bodie simply inserted into the original plot.L. Q. Jones (Smitty) and Clint Walker (Cheyenne)Clint Walker as main character Cheyenne Bodie is the only series regular. L. Q. Jones appears as Cheyenne's sidekick Smitty in three first-season episodes. Thereafter, no recurring characters make appearances as Cheynne's circumstances change with every episode and he relocates as his drifter tastes and lifestyle dictate. Diane Brewster first appears as Samantha Crawford, the swindler with a fake southern accent, in an episode called ""Dark Rider"" before the character migrates to Maverick to become the Maverick brothers' most celebrated nemesis. Among guest stars were the child actor Roger Mobley, later on NBC's Fury and a star of Walt Disney studios.ABC televised the show from 1955 to 1962: September 1955-September 1959 Tuesday 7:30-8:30 P.M.; September 1959-December 1962, Monday 7:30-8:30 P.M.; April 1963-September 1963, Friday 7:30-8:30 P.M..Dell Comics produced a comic book based on the series. After 3 issues in their Four Color Comics series, it got its own title for issues #4-25 from (1957-1962). All issues had photo covers. Milton Bradley published a Cheyenne board game for children based on the series. Golden Books published an illustrated storybook for very young children while Whitman Publishing printed a novel called The Lost Gold of Lion Park for older children.Cheyenne was a principal reason for ABC's ratings ascent during the mid-1950s. ABC had fewer national affiliates than CBS and NBC, but in markets with affiliates of all three networks, Cheyenne immediately entered the top ten; by 1957, it had become the number one program in those markets. Cheyenne finished the 1957-58 season as the second highest-rated series on ABC.Cheyenne was a co-winner of the 1957 Golden Globe Award for Television Achievement.",5,ONE OF THE GREAT PILLARS OF

976343,A30LMTLC9XVWKJ,B000EQ46H8,Only-A-Child,"[9, 11]","Running 107 episodes, from 1955 through 1963, ""Cheyenne"" was one of the first ""television"" productions from the Warner Brothers film studio. Clint Walker plays the title character, an ex-frontier scout who was raised by Cheyenne Indians after his parents were killed.Cheyenne Bodie roams the West in the days after the Civil War, having adventures and helping folks out. The tall laconic hero would eventually become television's quintessential loner but actually started out with a sidekick named Smitty (L.Q. Jones), who was a mapmaker. Cheyenne and Smitty do mapping work for the Army and in this occupation stumble across the people who make up each episode's story.The current DVD set covers the 15 episodes from Season One and includes a recent interview with Clint Walker called ""The Lonely Gunfighter: The Legacy of Cheyenne"". The reason there are only 15 episodes is because ""Cheyenne"" was only broadcast every third week, being part of an anthology series called ""Warner Brothers Presents"" which also included ""Casablanca"" (with Marcel Dalio) and ""King's Row"" (with Robert Horton and Jack Kelly). In subsequent seasons the anthology would feature shows like ""Conflict"", ""Sugarfoot"", and ""Bronco Lane"".Contrary to popular belief, the episodes on the 1st season DVD have not been abbreviated. Although they run less that the normal 50 minutes (60 minutes minus commercials) it is because the original broadcasts took some additional minutes for Warner Brothers to use in promoting their coming attractions; with a behind the scenes look at one of their soon to be released features.Also unique to the first season was an attempt to add scale to the stories by inserting a lot of stock footage of cattle drives, Indian attacks, and huge wagon trains. In general they did a better job than most ""B"" westerns of matching this footage to the back lot and sound stage stuff featuring the actual cast of each episode. But this technique and the busy schedule was a nightmare for the editors. The first episode ""Mountain Fortress"" includes a particularly amusing continuity issue. Watch how the sergeant and the trooper are killed early in an Indian attack, then magically reappear in a subsequent group shot. Most likely the editors noticed the problem but there was not time to re-shoot the scene with the correct cast.At least two episodes take actual movie plots and retell them in a Western setting. ""Fury at Rio Hondo"" is a retelling of ""To Have and to Have Not"" with Peggy Castle outstanding in the Lauren Bacall role. ""The Argonaunts"" is a retelling of ""The Treasure of the Sierra Madre"" and features Rod Taylor.Then again, what do I know?

976372,A1JJK67VXR1WSR,B000EQ46H8,William R. Hancock,"[14, 15]","Was absolutely delighted to find that the ""Cheyenne"" series were going to be packaged and released by Warner Brothers, and hope like heck they do some of the other WB classics of the 50s/60s like ""77 Sunset Strip"", ""Maverick"", ""Colt .45"" , etc.Premiering almost simultaneously with ""Gunsmoke"" in the fall of 1955, Cheyenne (though a ""limited run"" series) held its on in the Nielson ratings wars and became a runaway hit for Warners from its premiere on.There were big differences between what was done with ""Cheyenne"" and what CBS did with ""Gunsmoke"". Gunsmoke was""tied down"" to Dodge City, Kansas, for the most part...though Matt Dillon did make OCCASIONAL forays out into the ""territory""(to transport prisoners from one jurisdiction to another,for example) but mostly anything that went on, went on in Dodge and involved the nuclear ""Gunsmoke' character ensemble.""Cheyenne"", on the other hand, was all over the map. Bodie was a ""working drifter"" who roamed the west doing all sorts of odd jobs : government mapmaker, Army scout, Cattlemen's Association range detective, cowboy, part-time lawman, etc., and each of these jobs would invariably ride him into some conflict situation. And all of these conflict situations were enhanced by the fact that Warners owned reel after reel of stock footage from dozens of studio-made westerns and liberally added such to ""Cheyenne"" adventures to fill them out and give them greater ""scope"" and a more expensive look than most all the other western competition on the tube at that time. If you will notice, Cheyenne has a more varied wardrobe than any other t.v. cowpoke of the period. He has several different jackets of different colors and styles and sometimes his shirts and pants are different from episode to episode. He is also sometimes seen to wear a black hat and, at other times, a gray hat or (most likely, being a B & W show) a tan hat. All of this wardrobe variety has a specific production purpose: at some point in the episode stock footage is going to be inserted whereby the hero in whatever movie this film is taken from wore a certain outfit and Cheyenne has to be dressed appropriatelyto MATCH the original. Sometimes the original here is Randolph Scott and sometimes someone else. In any event, at times the match-up only involves less than a minute(and sometimes only SECONDS) of footage, but Bodie must wear that particular clothing ensemble to make the editing trick work when it is time for it to do so.All this padding is, for the most part, brilliantly done. In this first season collection there are footage ""lifts"" fromErrol Flynn's ""Dodge City"" and ""Virginia City"" and, in a later season, in an episode where Bodie is held prisoner by Indians and forced to helplessly watch the Battle of the Little Big Horn, the battle itself is lifted from ""They Died With Their Boots On"" with only the Flynn close-ups removed.This production technique served Warners well and always insured that ""Cheyenne"" had a lot more excitement and rousing action and adventure in it than anything Matt, Chester, Festus, Doc or Kitty incurred. Another plus was that big Clint Walkerwas a good actor who well understood ""eye work"" (acting with your eyes), body language, and underplaying a role (rather than ""hamming it up"" in, say, William Shatner style). Walker's performance is solid and he gives Bodie an image of courage, integrity, principles, ethics, and inner strength that embody to perfection what the idea of the Western Man was perceived to be like. But another touch was added as well : Walker also instilled, through masterfully executed nuance, a wistful air of loneliness to the character....a touch that drove female viewers wild (that, and the episodes that contrived to have the muscular Walker appear shirtless onscreen). Of all the western characters from television in the fifties and early sixties, Clint Walker's Cheyenne Bodie was...and is...far and away one of the most popular and memorable.This DVD collection is a great way to ""hook up"" with an old buddy if one is of the boomer generation, AND is an excellent introduction to Cheyenne to the younger crowd who haven't yet made his acquaintance. You get the pre-Maverick James Garner here in three episodes as well, two times as a cavalry officer and once as a minister (Reverend Brett Maverick??? Say Whaaat??).Now I would encourage one and all to buy this set because that will make the WB issue a SECOND SEASON collection, and THAT...my friends...is what I seriously want to get my hot little hands on. You see, the second season of ""Cheyenne"" produced one of the most well-remembered television episodes OF the 1950s, a long-time ""boomer"" favorite...the hair-raising""Big Ghost Basin"". This was one of those sleep-with-the-lights-on-and-a-butcher-knife-under-your-pillow ""thriller-dillers"" thatis as vividly remembered by ""boomers"" as the episodes ""The Hungry House"", ""The Grim Reaper"", Or ""Pidgeons From Hell"" on ""Thriller"", or ""To Serve Man"" on ""Twilight Zone"". ""Big Ghost Basin"" was adapted from a short story,""Nights of Terror"", by Steve Frazee, one of the best western writers of the fifties.It concerns cattlemen concerned by a serious rustler threat in their area, as well as ""something else"". That something else is called ""the campfire killer"" because IT attacks and kills...always by night...all pickets or cattle guards who are gathered around campfires. It crushes humans, pulverizes them, and leaves only corpses and outsized bizarre-looking tracks in its wake. On the show, it comes down to Cheyenne vs. ""the thing"" in the end.  Saw a VHS version of ""Big Ghost Basin"" recorded off of cable a couple of years back and was not disappointed. Oh, the make-up was a tad cheesy by today's standards, but the creature is only shown for a matter of seconds...and in poor light (on purpose)...so it doesn't come across as irredeemably fakey. In toto, ""Big Ghost"" stands the test of time quite well.So I urge you , tv fans, western fans, get out there and BUY this first season of Cheyenne....so I can hopefully get to see ""Cheyenne : Season Two, Episode 14"" by Christmas!!!!! (Better yet...by HALLOWEEN!!).",5,"Return of ""The Big Guy""",1156291200,"08 23, 2006",2006,6137,"['Was', 'absolutely', 'delighted', 'find', 'Cheyenne', 'series', 'were', 'going', 'be', 'packaged',
