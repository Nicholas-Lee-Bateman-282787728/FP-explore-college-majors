This was originally a NBC movie of the week I believe, called ""1000 Men and a Baby"".  The story is true and although I was no longer aboard, I knew many of the men who were.  I was an Aerographer's Mate Third Class then.  The crew of the Point Cruz have a reunion each year and the baby, who is now a grown man, usually attends these meetings.  This movie is hard to find on DVD and I was lucky to have found this one.  It is in excellent condition.  The movie is a heart-warming story.",4,I was stationed onboard this ship,1285200000,"09 23, 2010",2010,602,"['was', 'stationed', 'USS', 'Point', 'Cruz', 'CVE-119', 'two', 'years', 'just', 'prior', 'incidence', 'baby', 'adoption', 'was', 'originally', 'NBC', 'movie', 'week', 'believe', 'called', '1000', 'Men', 'Baby', 'story', 'true', 'was', 'no', 'longer', 'knew', 'many', 'men', 'who', 'were', 'was', 'Aerographer', 'Mate', 'Third', 'Class', 'then', 'crew', 'Point', 'Cruz', 'have', 'reunion', 'year', 'baby', 'who', 'now', 'grown', 'man', 'usually', 'meetings', 'movie', 'hard', 'find', 'DVD', 'was', 'lucky', 'have', 'found', 'one', 'excellent', 'condition', 'movie', 'heart-warming', 'story']",Narrow Escape

Why do they change the names and not cross reference them?This is one of my favorites.  Richard Thomas & Gerald McRaney are wonderful in this, and the actor who plays the Navy Chaplin (sorry I can't remember his name)is great.

As a result the Koreans would have destroyed the child if it wasn't for the intervention of an American Naval Doctor who brought him aboard an aircraft carrier and ""Danny"" was adoped by 1,000 men.  They made clothes for him, a crib for him and how they got the papers to get him to the US so he could be adopted is just a great story.
