Yes, it's not as polished as his late 70s-early 80s concert movies, but this was done shortly after the phase where Pryor was transforming beyond a Bill Cosby-type comedian and had spent time with Berkeley radicals after re-evaluating where his comedic heart lay.  (George Carlin went through the same kind of soul searching around the same time.)  This is as brilliant as the ""Wattstax"" monologues, and the final Wino-Junkie part shows what a great actor Pryor could be.  Check out [...] and see if it's available...support the site, and get it new for $10! If you appreciate Pryor's work, this film is a revelation, and since there's not a ton of earlier (pre-1975) filmed stand-up/or TV shots of his released out there (see the Flip Wilson DVDs and the Merv Griffin 40 People DVDs, for example), this is a great find!",5,Evolution/Revolution caught on film...,1215734400,"07 11, 2008",2008,900,"['CD', 'Evolution/Revolution', '5', 'stars', 'why', 'film', 'get', 'only', '3.5', 'Yes', 'not', 'as', 'polished', 'late', '70s-early', '80s', 'concert', 'movies', 'was', 'done', 'shortly', 'phase', 'where', 'Pryor', 'was', 'transforming', 'Bill', 'Cosby-type', 'comedian', 'had', 'spent', 'time', 'Berkeley', 'radicals', 're-evaluating', 'where', 'comedic', 'heart', 'lay', 'George', 'Carlin', 'went', 'same', 'kind', 'soul', 'searching', 'same', 'time', 'as', 'brilliant', 'Wattstax', 'monologues', 'final', 'Wino-Junkie', 'part', 'what', 'great', 'actor', 'Pryor', 'could', 'be', 'Check', 'out', '[', ']', 'see', 'available', 'support', 'site', 'get', 'new', '10', 'appreciate', 'Pryor', 'work', 'film', 'revelation', 'not', 'ton', 'earlier', 'pre-1975', 'filmed', 'stand-up/or', 'TV', 'shots', 'released', 'out', 'there', 'see', 'Flip', 'Wilson', 'DVDs', 'Merv', 'Griffin', '40', 'People', 'DVDs', 'example', 'great', 'find']",N/A

Live & Smoking is the birth of Richard Pryor.  I'm the first to argue that Pryor is the greatest, but this early performance is very hard to watch.  Pryor is obviously drunk or high, very nervous, and not funny at all.  The footage is ugly and between the low sound quality and Pryor's occasional incoherent rambling, thank heaven for subtitles.  This DVD is of interest to diehard Richard Pryor fans only.  It is amazing that he could take this seemingly terrible act and somehow refine it and polish it to grow into the star that we love.  To casual comedy fans Pryor says after the credits, ""I guess the [show] wasn't as funny as we hoped.""

He was also recording in front of the wrong audience. They barely laughed at some really funny stuff. It is at times uncomfortable to watch because you find yourself feeling embarrassed for him. He wants to do well but the audience doesn't cut him any slack. It sounds like the audience is eating (you can hear silverware clashing in the background) and they weren't giving him their undivided attention. This video was shot in the wrong place. It should have been filmed in Atlanta or Detroit. I believe the response from the audience would have been better.This is Richard Pryor in his embryonic stage. He was performing for the audience instead of performing for himself. If this video had been filmed years later, after his act had been polished, he probably wouldn't have given a flip about the audience being a drag. He would have just done his thing. Bless his heart, he was so nervous. At one point, he even asked the audience to pretend that the cameras weren't there. And if you watch it through the ending credits he even says himself, ""This ain't as funny as we thought it was gonna be."" You just want to go through the TV and hug him. The material was funny, he was just in the wrong place at the wrong time.I give it 3 stars because of the film's location and because of the horrible ending. The editor just cut him off in the middle of a wino routine. If you are a die-hard Richard Pryor fan (like myself), I would recommend this video. But if you just want to see some good-old fashioned Richie Pry at his best, polished and all, ""Live In Concert,"" or ""Live on The Sunset Strip"" may be a better choice for you.",3,Early Richard Pryor,1165017600,"12 2, 2006",2006,1771,"['Live', 'Smokin', 'contain', 'funny', 'material', 'was', 'one', 'Richard', 'first', 'video', 'recordings', 'not', 'first', 'was', 'very', 'nervous', 'was', 'also', 'recording', 'front', 'wrong', 'audience', 'barely', 'laughed', 'really', 'funny', 'stuff', 'times', 'uncomfortable', 'watch', 'find', 'feeling', 'embarrassed', 'do', 'well', 'audience', ""n't"", 'cut', 'slack', 'audience', 'eating', 'can', 'hear', 'silverware', 'clashing', 'background', 'were', ""n't"", 'giving', 'undivided', 'attention', 'video', 'was', 'shot', 'wrong', 'place', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'filmed', 'Atlanta', 'Detroit', 'believe', 'response', 'audience', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'better.This', 'Richard', 'Pryor', 'embryonic', 'stage', 'was', 'performing', 'audience', 'instead', 'performing', 'video', 'had', 'been', 'filmed', 'years', 'later', 'act', 'had', 'been', 'polished', 'probably', 'would', ""n't"", 'have', 'given', 'flip', 'audience', 'being', 'drag', 'would', 'have', 'just', 'done', 'thing', 'Bless', 'heart', 'was', 'so', 'nervous', 'one', 'point', 'even', 'asked', 'audience', 'pretend', 'cameras', 'were', ""n't"", 'there', 'watch', 'ending', 'credits', 'even', 'ai', ""n't"", 'as', 'funny', 'thought', 'was', 'gon', 'na', 'be', 'just', 'want', 'go', 'TV', 'hug', 'material', 'was', 'funny', 'was', 'just', 'wrong', 'place', 'wrong', 'time.I', 'give', '3', 'stars', 'film', 'location', 'horrible', 'ending', 'editor', 'just', 'cut', 'off', 'middle', 'wino', 'routine', 'are', 'die-hard', 'Richard', 'Pryor', 'fan', 'would', 'recommend', 'video', 'just', 'want', 'see', 'good-old', 'fashioned', 'Richie', 'Pry', 'best', 'polished', 'Live', 'Concert', 'Live', 'Sunset', 'Strip', 'may', 'be', 'better', 'choice']",N/A
