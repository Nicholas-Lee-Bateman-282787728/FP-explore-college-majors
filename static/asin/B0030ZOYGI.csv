It is rated Teen due to some of the words that fortunately go over the head of most young. All the main characters are fun with their own personalities. The voices are casted well. This show is so well done it made me become a fan of the manga which it stays very faithful in feel and story until about book 9 (now at book 16). The anime wraps up as well as it can with only 26 episodes. I do enjoy the few honorifics and wish the manga used them. The main honorific used is Senpai= older school classmate.Extras: The disks are worth purchasing just for the outtakes. We laughed so hard that we had to watch the outtakes twice to hear things we laughed over the first time.  Nothing better than hearing Col. Roy Mustang say, ""mmm... Mori like seashells."" I did have to explain to the 12 year old a few adult terms. The six episode commentaries are done by the voice actors- entertaining and only wish there were more.

Very well made product.This anime is built more on the laughs, than on the romance, so its appropriate for either gender really. Although if there is ever a sequel to this anime, that one might delve more into actual character development, this one keeps things pretty simple and happy.The last few episodes have things get slightly serious, but if you know this anime at all, you know that even when things get serious: may of the characters are built to still make jokes and be humorous.The main character is rather ""unmotivated"" as is part of the joke in the series, but because she has to pay back a debt to this ""Host Club"" of very wealthy, handome young men, she is forced to dress as a boy and entertain (innocently) young women at their school.

I've been a fan of the series for quite some time, hence why I got this complete series.So, previous reviews had indicated that the box set came in the pink packaging that the BluRay version comes in and other peoples reviews had indicated that it came in the picture shown above. I was really confused but I'm here to tell you that I bought from this page (in other words, I bought the non BluRay version), and was slightly surprised as to what I found considering some of the one star reviews and all. This product does indeed come with all the episodes with some fun extras, the thing that will throw you off is the fact it comes in a case that is the size of a normal DVD case. All four discs were in there, it was just cleverly placed to be compact. The inside is organized according to episode place and name. The front cover is the one indicated on this page, not the pink version. It came with a slipcover to boot, which I thought was nice. All in all, it was very organized and professional considering who has the rights to it. (Yeah, I'm talking to you Rumination) The price I wasn't too thrilled about, which is why I saved up for it.I know some previous reviews pointed out some mistakes from the dubbed version, which is correct. However these mistakes are hard to find unless your listening close.

First of all, like many Funi titles past and present, the episodes are overly compressed and the video suffers as a result.  Color banding, digital artifacts, and background noise are quite prevalent and very distracting.  I have seen bootleg DVDs that look better than this one.  Funimation was starting to get better when they were only doing 4 episodes a disc, but it's become quite obvious with releases like this that they cannot handle the now fairly standard 6 episodes per disc.Second of all, the dub was just awful. Funimation has put out some bad dubs in recent years, like Kodocha and Full Metal Alchemist Brotherhood, but Ouran takes the cake.  Once again, instead of putting though into their casting, they just simply took the route of using the ""Hot VA's"" of the moment.  So we get stuck with Vic Mignogna and Caitlin Glass in roles they truly do not fit.  In fact, their performances are so off, it drags the rest of the performances down, which is a shame.  Greg Ayres and others in the cast turn in truly great performances, but the laziness of Vic's and Caitlin's performances nearly ruin them.The show itself should bet 4 stars, but this release is 1 or 2 stars at best.  Funimation should really be ashamed of this one.

She meets the highschool's Host Club, which is basically a group of young men who entertain the school's young ladies. Keep in mind they're all rich, and somewhat arrogant, so they kind of just sit around and talk about rich kid stuff.The Host Club thinks she's a guy, she accidently breaks an expensive vase and instantly earns herself a very large debt, and the only way to pay it off is to join the Host Club.This is just the beginning. Like I said I don't want to go into too much detail because Ouran High School Host Club is the type of anime that is best enjoyed when not too much is known about it going in.I was mainly interested in the series because I thought they were all guys (she looks like a guy when she works as a ""Host Boy"") and I thought it would be fun and romantic (and gay) to watch.It is fun, and romantic too. But Its not what I expected. However, I never thought it would be THIS good! I am really enjoying the series (almost finished with it) and I like how each episode brings enough humor and character movement to keep you interested. And speaking of the humor, I find myself laughing out-loud alot. This type of comedy is just the thing I have been looking for. And there's just enough gay humor too!The animation is really cool. Very detailed, and cartoonish (if only to add to the comedic effect). The music is nice, but nothing worth freaking out over.But if there's one thing that makes this series shine, its the characters/story. Its charming, witty, hilarious, with hints of mild sexual comedy and social stuff (rich people, poor people), but it never takes itself too seriously. The show knows what it is and what it wants, and as a result we the viewers are presented with a well thought out anime series with high replay value.I'm really glad I got into this series because its now one of my favorites. Its easy to fall in love with the Host Club boys, and they're all compelling and quirky enough that they move the episodic situations along with ease and before you know it you've been watching for hours.When an anime series accomplishes this, its well worth your time in my opinion.",5,I didn't expect It would be THIS cool,1268870400,"03 18, 2010",2010,2440,"['wo', ""n't"", 'go', 'too', 'much', 'detail', 'part', 'fun', 'anime', 'series', 'just', 'hanging', 'ride', 'not', 'knowing', 'alot', 'going', 'it.But', 'basically', 'story', 'girl', 'who', 'very', 'nice', 'prestigious', 'high', 'school', 'where', 'rich', 'kids', 'are', 'numerous', 'poor', 'people', 'are', 'thought', 'fairytale', 'material', 'highschool', 'Host', 'Club', 'basically', 'group', 'young', 'men', 'who', 'entertain', 'school', 'young', 'ladies', 'Keep', 'mind', ""'re"", 'rich', 'somewhat', 'arrogant', 'kind', 'just', 'sit', 'around', 'talk', 'rich', 'kid', 'stuff.The', 'Host', 'Club', 'guy', 'accidently', 'expensive', 'vase', 'instantly', 'very', 'large', 'debt', 'only', 'way', 'pay', 'off', 'join', 'Host', 'Club.This', 'just', 'beginning', 'said', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'go', 'too', 'much', 'detail', 'Ouran', 'High', 'School', 'Host', 'Club', 'type', 'anime', 'best', 'enjoyed', 'when', 'not', 'too', 'much', 'known', 'going', 'in.I', 'was', 'mainly', 'interested', 'series', 'thought', 'were', 'guys', 'guy', 'when', 'Host', 'Boy', 'thought', 'would', 'be', 'fun', 'romantic', 'gay', 'watch.It', 'fun', 'romantic', 'too', 'not', 'what', 'expected', 'However', 'never', 'thought', 'would', 'be', 'THIS', 'good', 'am', 'really', 'enjoying', 'series', 'almost', 'finished', 'like', 'how', 'episode', 'enough', 'humor', 'character', 'movement', 'keep', 'interested', 'speaking', 'humor', 'find', 'laughing', 'out-loud', 'alot', 'type', 'comedy', 'just', 'thing', 'have', 'been', 'looking', 'just', 'enough', 'gay', 'humor', 'too', 'animation', 'really', 'cool', 'Very', 'detailed', 'cartoonish', 'only', 'add', 'comedic', 'effect', 'music', 'nice', 'nothing', 'worth', 'freaking', 'out', 'over.But', 'one', 'thing', 'series', 'shine', 'characters/story', 'charming', 'witty', 'hilarious', 'hints', 'mild', 'sexual', 'comedy', 'social', 'stuff', 'rich', 'people', 'poor', 'people', 'never', 'too', 'seriously', 'show', 'what', 'what', 'result', 'viewers', 'are', 'presented', 'well', 'thought', 'out', 'anime', 'series', 'high', 'replay', 'value.I', ""'m"", 'really', 'glad', 'got', 'series', 'now', 'one', 'favorites', 'easy', 'fall', 'love', 'Host', 'Club', ""'re"", 'compelling', 'quirky', 'enough', 'move', 'episodic', 'situations', 'ease', 'know', ""'ve"", 'been', 'watching', 'hours.When', 'anime', 'series', 'accomplishes', 'well', 'time', 'opinion']",N/A

A Solinas ""ea_solinas""","[0, 0]","""The Ouran host Club is where the school's handsomest boys with too much time on their hands entertain young ladies who also have way too much time on their hands.""Well, that's the basic description. But ""Ouran High School Host Club: Complete Series"" is so much more than just a slapsticky reverse-harem anime -- it's a charming little comedy series that's constantly awash in costumes, geekery, over-the-top schemes, and an adorable budding romance. Even in its more serious moments, it's utterly charming.Haruhi Fujioka has just started on her scholarship at the elite Ouran Academy, and is looking for a quiet place to study... when she stumbles across the Host Club. The six wealthy boys there entertain girls with flirtation and elaborate costumes and decorations. The members: melodramatic and not-too-bright Tamaki, mischievous Hitachin twins Kaoru and Hikaru, cool-headed genius Kyoya, childlike Honey, and his silent stoic cousin Mori.But when Haruhi accidentally breaks an antique vase, she finds herself drafted into the Host Club to pay off the debt... and only THEN does Tamaki find out she's a girl. But she continues working at the Host Club, and encounters some pretty bizarre adventures as she tries to navigate the world of the uber-wealthy. And when they aren't entertaining girls, the Host Club tries to help people with their fragmented relationships and troubles.But just being rich doesn't keep the Host Club members from having their own troubles -- and as she gets to know them, Haruhi learns that the happy-go-lucky Tamaki has a tragic past that threatens to ruin his future. Will the little band of friends be able to help their ""boss""?It's hard to really summarize an anime like ""Ouran High School Host Club"" -- it's a big fluffy whirl of costumes, roses, over-the-top luxury, and lighthearted pokes at anime conventions (""Yay! There's debauchery here!""). It's just such a fun little show, and it's made even better because it's almost surreal at times -- Haruhi even notes, after an ""Alice in Wonderland"" dream, that she can't even tell when she's awake or asleep.There's lots of funny goofy dialogue (""I never would have pegged the boss as an S&M; pervert."" ""I told you! It wasn't like that at all!"") and hilariously weird situations (the guys all dress up in over-the-top drag, causing Haruhi to roll around screaming with laughter). But there are some more touching moments as well, such as Tamaki comforting Haruhi when she's frightened by a thunderstorm, or the flashback episodes where we see how Tamaki befriended the icy Kyoya or the manipulative twins.But the best part of the show is the characters -- Haruhi is a likably down-to-earth, sensible ""commoner"" who often seems weirded out by the antics of the megarich teens of Ouran. But she's slowly charmed by Tamaki, a sweet but not-very-bright young man who seems pretty confused about his romantic feelings. You end up liking Tamaki even better when you find out the truth about his family, and what a kind person he is.And the rest of the cast is lots of fun as well: Hunny's cutesiness is a little annoying, but it's fun to see him kicking the collective backsides of a secret police force. Mori is cool (if underdeveloped), Kyoya is a delightful mix of insecurity and Machievellian scheming, and the twins are simply hilarious (especially since their ""theme"" is twincest).""Ouran High School Host Club: The Complete Series"" is a delightful, lovable anime series, and leaves you desperately wishing it would never end.

One uncomfortable scene leads to another and our fish-out-of-water stumbles and knocks an expensive vase off its pedestal and shatters it upon the floor. This newly incurred debt requires our hapless hero to join the club and eventually become a host as well.There's only one problem: Haruhi isn't a pretty-boy at all, but a short-haired, flat-chested girl wearing boy's clothing. The joke is that all the boys are so effeminate that Haruhi fits right in and can easily pass for a guy... and to be fair: it's a pretty good joke.The notion of a herem anime (in this case a reverse-herem) depicting a young man or woman surrounded by members of the opposite sex vying for attention has been well established in the medium. Love Hina is an excellent example of the genre, but unlike other herems which utilize fanservice, cleavage and panty-shots, Ouran's heaping of ""man-service"" is laid on far too thick to be standard formula so much as sharp satire. When Ouran does fanservice, it is usually setting you up for a good joke before completely inverting the scenario and breathing life into characters and archetypes unused to anything aside from stale air and genre-tropes that ultimately go nowhere. It might be going too far to say that Ouran is meditative, but it nonetheless skillfully deconstructs the herem without losing any of the genre's appeal in the process. There are several notable characters in Ouran Highschool Host Club, and you will almost certainly fall in love with at least one of them. There's the harmlessly conceited and hopelessly shallow Tamaki, the pankster twins Hikaru and Kaoru, the shotacon man-child Honey, and the serious and intelligent Kyoya.The animation might not be the most obvious thing to praise in a slice-of-life/herem show, but Ouran Highschool Host Club seems to have been lavishly endowed both with a good budget and the extremely talented team of Studio Bones (Fullmetal Alchemist, Darker Than Black). The art design is fantastic, characters move in exaggerated and impressive ways, and the entire show never once slips away from being the most enjoyable romp of over-the-top humor you could ever hope to indulge in. Far from holding its own, the music in Ouran excels and stands out at every point for exactly the same reason as everything else--it is constantly over-played. Waltzes, ballads, and sympathies are not nearly so ill-suited to comedy as one might think, and the opening theme Sakura Drop stands out fashionably even when licensors decided to translate the song into English. It might not be as good as the Japanese opening... but it is still compulsively listenable when compared to similar song dubbing.In like manner to the music, the English dub for Ouran is remarkably well-crafted--anime scripts are hard to translate as is, but comedy is an almost impossible task to translate into another language. Ouran's dub is as perfectly flawless as one could ever hope--retaining all the humor and bombasticism evident in the original Japanese... which was, in itself, utterly flawless anyway. Caitlin Glass is likely the standout dub actor, perfectly balancing both the mellowness of snark of her character. No matter what language you intend to watch Ouran in, you are well set for a lavish ride of humor and jokes perfectly suited for the otaku in all of us.In closing: Ouran is an absolute masterpiece of comedic timing and extravagantly over-the-top situations rife with irony and endearing characters that make the whole ride worth taking. This is a party that you will never forget... and an anime that is deserving of every otaku with the time and money to spare on it. Whether you're a fan of herems or not, whether you're a girl or not, this is a show that you need to watch.Content Advisory: Ouran is a comedy about andragogy, and sexuality is latent in its subtext if nothing else. There's no nudity... but some of the situations themselves are inappropriate for younger viewers.",5,A lavishly produced anime comedy that both indulges and satirizes its genre,1359331200,"01 28, 2013",2013,4428,"['Haruhi', 'Fujioka', 'campus', 'prestigious', 'Ouran', 'Academy', 'prep-school', 'super-rich', 'far', 'being', 'member', 'elite', 'Haruhi', 'merely', 'exceptional', 'honor-student', 'accepted', 'school', 'scholarship', 'fish-out-of-water', 'protagonist', 'who', 'pure', 'coincidence', 'room', 'Host', 'Club', 'What', 'Host', 'Club', 'A', 'group', 'attractive', 'even', 'pretty', 'highschool', 'boys', 'who', 'entertain', 'young', 'lady', 'students', 'tea', 'cake', 'harmless', 'flirting', 'One', 'uncomfortable', 'scene', 'fish-out-of-water', 'stumbles', 'knocks', 'expensive', 'vase', 'pedestal', 'shatters', 'floor', 'newly', 'incurred', 'debt', 'hapless', 'hero', 'join', 'club', 'eventually', 'become', 'host', 'well.There', 'only', 'one', 'problem', 'Haruhi', ""n't"", 'pretty-boy', 'short-haired', 'flat-chested', 'girl', 'wearing', 'boy', 'clothing', 'joke', 'boys', 'are', 'so', 'effeminate', 'Haruhi', 'fits', 'right', 'can', 'easily', 'pass', 'guy', 'be', 'fair', 'pretty', 'good', 'joke.The', 'notion', 'herem', 'anime', 'case', 'reverse-herem', 'depicting', 'young', 'man', 'woman', 'surrounded', 'members', 'opposite', 'sex', 'vying', 'attention', 'been', 'well', 'established', 'medium', 'Love', 'Hina', 'excellent', 'example', 'genre', 'other', 'herems', 'utilize', 'fanservice', 'cleavage', 'panty-shots', 'Ouran', 'heaping', 'man-service', 'laid', 'far', 'too', 'thick', 'be', 'standard', 'formula', 'so', 'much', 'sharp', 'satire', 'When', 'Ouran', 'fanservice', 'usually', 'setting', 'up', 'good', 'joke', 'completely', 'inverting', 'scenario', 'breathing', 'life', 'characters', 'archetypes', 'unused', 'anything', 'aside', 'stale', 'air', 'genre-tropes', 'ultimately', 'go', 'nowhere', 'might', 'be', 'going', 'too', 'far', 'say', 'Ouran', 'meditative', 'nonetheless', 'skillfully', 'herem', 'losing', 'genre', 'appeal', 'process', 'are', 'several', 'notable', 'characters', 'Ouran', 'Highschool', 'Host', 'Club', 'will', 'almost', 'certainly', 'fall', 'love', 'least', 'one', 'harmlessly', 'conceited', 'hopelessly', 'shallow', 'Tamaki', 'pankster', 'Hikaru', 'Kaoru', 'shotacon', 'man-child', 'Honey', 'serious', 'intelligent', 'Kyoya.The', 'animation', 'might', 'not', 'be', 'most', 'obvious', 'thing', 'praise', 'slice-of-life/herem', 'show', 'Ouran', 'Highschool', 'Host', 'Club', 'have', 'been', 'lavishly', 'endowed', 'good', 'budget', 'extremely', 'talented', 'team', 'Studio', 'Bones', 'Fullmetal', 'Alchemist', 'Darker', 'Than', 'Black', 'art', 'design', 'fantastic', 'characters', 'move', 'exaggerated', 'impressive', 'ways', 'entire', 'show', 'never', 'once', 'away', 'being', 'most', 'enjoyable', 'romp', 'over-the-top', 'humor', 'could', 'ever', 'hope', 'indulge', 'Far', 'holding', 'own', 'music', 'Ouran', 'excels', 'out', 'point', 'exactly', 'same', 'reason', 'everything', 'else', 'constantly', 'over-played', 'Waltzes', 'ballads', 'sympathies', 'are', 'not', 'nearly', 'so', 'ill-suited', 'comedy', 'one', 'might', 'think', 'opening', 'theme', 'Sakura', 'Drop', 'out', 'fashionably', 'even', 'when', 'licensors', 'decided', 'translate', 'song', 'English', 'might', 'not', 'be', 'as', 'good', 'Japanese', 'opening', 'still', 'compulsively', 'listenable', 'when', 'compared', 'similar', 'song', 'dubbing.In', 'manner', 'music', 'English', 'dub', 'Ouran', 'remarkably', 'well-crafted', 'anime', 'scripts', 'are', 'hard', 'translate', 'comedy', 'almost', 'impossible', 'task', 'translate', 'language', 'Ouran', 'dub', 'as', 'perfectly', 'flawless', 'one', 'could', 'ever', 'hope', 'retaining', 'humor', 'bombasticism', 'evident', 'original', 'Japanese', 'was', 'utterly', 'flawless', 'anyway', 'Caitlin', 'Glass', 'likely', 'standout', 'dub', 'actor', 'perfectly', 'balancing', 'mellowness', 'snark', 'character', 'matter', 'what', 'language', 'intend', 'watch', 'Ouran', 'are', 'well', 'set', 'lavish', 'ride', 'humor', 'jokes', 'perfectly', 'suited', 'otaku', 'us.In', 'closing', 'Ouran', 'absolute', 'masterpiece', 'comedic', 'timing', 'extravagantly', 'over-the-top', 'situations', 'rife', 'irony', 'endearing', 'characters', 'make', 'whole', 'ride', 'taking', 'party', 'will', 'never', 'forget', 'anime', 'deserving', 'otaku', 'time', 'money', 'spare', ""'re"", 'fan', 'herems', 'not', ""'re"", 'girl', 'not', 'show', 'need', 'watch.Content', 'Advisory', 'Ouran', 'comedy', 'andragogy', 'sexuality', 'latent', 'subtext', 'nothing', 'else', 'nudity', 'situations', 'are', 'inappropriate', 'younger', 'viewers']",N/A

Well, it appears to have a few twists and kinks as yet unknown to me, because there were one or two places where this show did surprise me. I even learned a new word: ""twincest""!Don't get any ideas now: this isn't hentai or anything. Not even ecchi. If you're looking for people to just whip out their bits and show them to you, you'll have to look elsewhere. Rather, what we have here is a gloriously farcical explosion of _female_ otaku sexuality. As such, it's less about the bits, and more about the relationships between the characters.And yes, this show is very much a farce - one far too self aware to take even itself very seriously. It has to be, because there are layers here. On the one hand, Ouran High School Host Club is almost nothing but parody. On another, there is one respect in which it almost borders on becoming the very thing it parodies. Our female lead, Haruhi, is to all intents and purposes the only female in her world, since all the other female characters are either just guest stars or little more than cardboard cut-outs. Thus, cool and above it all as our level headed heroine may be, she is constantly surrounded - and almost as constantly hit on - by representatives of virtually every sexual fantasy that even the most... creative otaku fangirl could dream up.Except, of course, for the fantasy that Haruhi herself embodies...Fortunately, this show is just too clever, too gleefully pro-active in embracing its own ridiculousness, for us to hold a little thing like that against it.Western cartoons seem so insipid by comparison.Theo.",5,Deliciously Funny & Strangely Educational,1350518400,"10 18, 2012",2012,1722,"[""'ve"", 'often', 'said', 'one', 'thing', 'internet', 'taught', 'human', 'sexuality', 'vastly', 'more', 'diverse', 'could', 'ever', 'have', 'imagined', 'Well', 'have', 'few', 'twists', 'kinks', 'yet', 'unknown', 'were', 'one', 'two', 'places', 'where', 'show', 'did', 'surprise', 'even', 'learned', 'new', 'word', 'twincest', 'Do', ""n't"", 'get', 'ideas', 'now', ""n't"", 'hentai', 'anything', 'Not', 'even', 'ecchi', ""'re"", 'looking', 'people', 'just', 'whip', 'out', 'bits', 'show', ""'ll"", 'have', 'look', 'elsewhere', 'Rather', 'what', 'have', 'here', 'gloriously', 'farcical', 'explosion', '_female_', 'otaku', 'sexuality', 'such', 'less', 'bits', 'more', 'relationships', 'characters.And', 'yes', 'show', 'very', 'much', 'farce', 'one', 'far', 'too', 'self', 'aware', 'take', 'even', 'very', 'seriously', 'be', 'are', 'layers', 'here', 'one', 'hand', 'Ouran', 'High', 'School', 'Host', 'Club', 'almost', 'nothing', 'parody', 'one', 'respect', 'almost', 'borders', 'becoming', 'very', 'thing', 'female', 'lead', 'Haruhi', 'intents', 'only', 'female', 'world', 'other', 'female', 'characters', 'are', 'just', 'guest', 'stars', 'little', 'more', 'cardboard', 'cut-outs', 'Thus', 'cool', 'level', 'headed', 'heroine', 'may', 'be', 'constantly', 'surrounded', 'almost', 'constantly', 'hit', 'representatives', 'virtually', 'sexual', 'fantasy', 'even', 'most', 'creative', 'otaku', 'fangirl', 'could', 'dream', 'up.Except', 'course', 'fantasy', 'Haruhi', 'embodies', 'Fortunately', 'show', 'just', 'too', 'clever', 'too', 'gleefully', 'pro-active', 'embracing', 'own', 'ridiculousness', 'hold', 'little', 'thing', 'it.Western', 'cartoons', 'seem', 'so', 'insipid', 'comparison.Theo']",N/A

1316353,A2H9KVW9YSCCM1,B0030ZOYGI,Viennywrites,"[3, 4]","This has got to be one of my favorite animes of all time. It has lots of humor, comedy, fun, and romance - all the elements of perfect shojo.Haruhi Fujioka is an honor student who enrolls into the rich kid school, ""Ouran Academy"". After stumbling into the Host Club's meeting and entertainment room and breaking a prized vase, Haruhi is mistaken to be a boy and must repay the members of the Host Club back by becoming a Host member.The story goes on from that with 26 episodes. This is unfortunate because the series seemed too short and it left a miserable cliff hanger - what will happen to all the Host club members? Hopefully after they finish up with the manga, they can conclude the anime with a season 2. But we'll see how that goes.The animation is hilarious - I love anime because it accentuates the person's skeptical and dubious expressions on faces, and OHSC excels at this. All the characters have their very own special personality. Tamaki, the gorgeous and blubbering idiot, Kyoya, the smart and handsome one who is tactical at business, the twin brothers Kaoru and Hikaru, usually referred to as the ""Little Devil Types"" in the show, Honey, the little boy ""Lolita"" and, Mori, ""the cool type"" and basically Honey's bodyguard and companion. And, of course, Haruhi, the common-sensed heroine of the story. Out of all the animes I have watched, I'd have to say that Haruhi is one of the few heroines that I actually like and admire. There is a touch of sexual comedy, including some very mild and suggestive yaoi and yuri (aka homosexuality fiction) that is present throughout the story which adds a great part of humor into the plot. The music isn't anything to brag about (but, just IMO). Voices were pretty good for both the subbed and dubbed.All in all, great story I'd recommend anyone seeing!",5,Hilariously rediculous,1310947200,"07 18, 2011",2011,1811,"['got', 'be', 'one', 'favorite', 'animes', 'time', 'lots', 'humor', 'comedy', 'fun', 'romance', 'elements', 'perfect', 'shojo.Haruhi', 'Fujioka', 'honor', 'student', 'who', 'rich', 'kid', 'school', 'Ouran', 'Academy', 'stumbling', 'Host', 'Club', 'meeting', 'entertainment', 'room', 'breaking', 'prized', 'vase', 'Haruhi', 'mistaken', 'be', 'boy', 'must', 'repay', 'members', 'Host', 'Club', 'back', 'becoming', 'Host', 'member.The', 'story', '26', 'episodes', 'unfortunate', 'series', 'seemed', 'too', 'short', 'left', 'miserable', 'cliff', 'hanger', 'what', 'will', 'happen', 'Host', 'club', 'members', 'Hopefully', 'finish', 'up', 'manga', 'can', 'conclude', 'anime', 'season', '2', ""'ll"", 'see', 'how', 'goes.The', 'animation', 'hilarious', 'love', 'anime', 'person', 'skeptical', 'dubious', 'expressions', 'OHSC', 'excels', 'characters', 'have', 'very', 'own', 'special', 'personality', 'Tamaki', 'gorgeous', 'blubbering', 'idiot', 'Kyoya', 'smart', 'handsome', 'one', 'who', 'tactical', 'business', 'twin', 'brothers', 'Kaoru', 'Hikaru', 'usually', 'referred', 'Little', 'Devil', 'Types', 'show', 'Honey', 'little', 'boy', 'Lolita', 'Mori', 'cool', 'type', 'basically', 'Honey', 'bodyguard', 'companion', 'course', 'Haruhi', 'common-sensed', 'heroine', 'story', 'animes', 'have', 'watched', ""'d"", 'have', 'say', 'Haruhi', 'one', 'few', 'heroines', 'actually', 'admire', 'touch', 'sexual', 'comedy', 'including', 'very', 'mild', 'suggestive', 'yaoi', 'yuri', 'aka', 'homosexuality', 'fiction', 'present', 'story', 'great', 'part', 'humor', 'plot', 'music', ""n't"", 'anything', 'brag', 'just', 'IMO', 'Voices', 'were', 'pretty', 'good', 'subbed', 'dubbed.All', 'great', 'story', ""'d"", 'recommend', 'anyone', 'seeing']",N/A
