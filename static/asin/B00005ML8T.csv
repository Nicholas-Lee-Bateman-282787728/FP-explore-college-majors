Cho is every bit the superstar as she narrates her entire career, if not life, using the funniest impersonations of her mother (that are sometimes so touching they'll make you cry) and the scariest parts of her very colourful career. She's honest about her previous problems with drugs, her obsessions over her weight, and all the rocky relationships she's survived, making her comedy so important to her audience because of her candid confessions. Apart from that, she's the damned funniest woman in the world next to Jennifer Saunders, and this film shows us everything about what makes her so.

By far one of the funniest stand-up films around, what makes this a great film is that she lets the audience see her human side.  It takes much courage to discuss the whirlwind of emotions as well as the physical and mental stresses surrounding her failed TV show -- the producers said she was too fat to play herself, she wasn't Asian enough, the alcoholism, the hospital time.  To go through that hell and still come out strong and with your sense of humor intact and then want to share it...she is to be admired.This is one film that I truly can watch over and over.

666282,A3LU79BYMWZEW9,B00005ML8T,Gregor von Kallahann,"[0, 1]","I've seen snippets from Margaret Cho's other comedy routines, but this, her first, is the only one I've watched in its entirety (and more than once).  You'd think I was afraid to watch the later ones--not because I'm easily offended or put-off--but simply because this show is so solid (laugh-out-loud funny, but also touchingly honest) that maybe I'm almost afraid I'll be disappointed in the follow-up films.  Definitely something to work on in this new year.It's not that this recorded performance is perfect.  In essence, I'd have to agree with some commentators that her timing SEEMS to be off on occasion and that some bits are milked too long.  But I say ""seems"" because this is a recording of a live show and, obviously, quite a different experience from experiencing it first-hand.  A comedian sometimes pauses, in response to audience reaction, and that doesn't always come through on a videorecording.  And sometimes, it may just me the viewer (in this case, me) who's being dense and NOT getting it.  The first time I watched the show, I didn't understand the seemingly endless repetitions of  the ""Hi, my name is Gwen and I'm here...""  Second time through, I had  a ""D'oh"" moment, and it finally dawned on me that Gwen was going from hospital bed to hospital bed saying the same durned thing over and over.How I missed that the first time, I'll never know.Some will no doubt find the comedy-as-therapy approach to much of this material a little too much.  Again, I'd say you have to keep in mind that this is a film of a live performance.  The close ups capture the pained look in Margaret's face at some key moments--which is more than the audience can see at a distance.  But then again, they CAN hear the emotion in her delivery, and that's impossible to miss.  But if you think Margaret Cho is unique among comics in using her personal pain as raw material for comedy, you may need to go back and give other contemporary comics (well, really, comics from the last several decades) a serious re-listening or re-viewing.  Think Richard Pryor!  Think Chris Rock!  Comics have been ""bringing the pain"" for decades now (and longer if mother-in-law jokes count.)Scrolling through some of the reviews posted on this site, I see one or two that talk about how much sharper and more focused her later routines are on the subsequent DVDs.  If that's true, I really need to get over my fear of disappointment and give NOTORIOUS C.H.O. and REVOLUTION a shot.  But this one will always have a special place on my DVD shelf.

She is usually very funny, and her audience is really having a good time here.  Some of my favorite parts are where she impersonates her mother and that ABC hired an ""Asian consultant"" for her horrible sitcom.  The mother bit is hilarious, and the ABC bit is hilarious as well as outrageous (maybe the folks at ABC didn't realise that Korea is considered part of Asia).  I did object to when Margaret talks about how she became a drunk, drugged out tramp after the sitcom was cancelled.  The term she used was she gave a lot of unnecessary h**d.  I understand that she needs to vent, but I don't really like to hear too much about the sordid details of her private life, and I doubt that her current husband cared for it that much either (guys do not like to hear their current squeeze's past, no matter how ""open minded"" they are).  I'm glad she's cleaned up, and I hope she stays that way.  She doesn't really go into too much political stuff here, which is good.  Too often Margaret's poiltical rantings become shrill and humourless, like a lot of political rantings tend to do.

But in case i run across something that might make a joke less funny ill put my regular ###s around it so you can skip over that if youd like.""I'm The One That I Want"" is one of the three dvds of Margaret Chos work that i know of. Ive only seen one other (Notorious C.H.O.) so far while the other im waiting for when im in the mood for some standup again. Ive also seen her on Comedy Central a time or two and watched her tv show ""All American Girl"". Does it show im a fan? LOL! ;DBut this was a different Margaret than i had seen before. She had her usual topic that outlines all of her shows: Acceptance. Acceptance for gays, acceptance for Asians, acceptance for overweight people, especially women in her industry. Im not a regular part of any of these worlds (Im pretty average in my weight, im not Asian, and i live in the midwest where if you even have a homosexual thought they crucify you), but somehow whenever Margaret speaks i can relate it to my own life somehow. Its all about wanting to love and be loved.What was different about this show was that it was after her television series had been cancelled. So, while the first half hour or so was about homosexual lifestyle, the bulk of the show was about her being Asian and an overweight woman. She isnt afraid to point out the steriotypes. She spoke about how people hadnt seen an Asian role model like her before because she ###""...didnt play the violin. I didnt f""k Woody Allen.""### She also mentioned how much the producers worried about her weight and how much they made her worry about her weight. It was a devistating thing when her show got cancelled because she was replaced by Drew Carrey who she says she loves but she still quips ###""They cancelled my show and replaced me with Drew Carrey because hes so skinny.""###Margaret talks openly about her hardships during these hard times. The standup becomes her own little soapbox like usual, but this time it feels more effective (at least for a Cho fan who cares a lot about her). Her routine slips back and forth between funny and serious. A couple of times people werent sure if she was making a joke or not so nervous laughter could be heard in small protions throughout the presentation. This was definently a theraputic act for Margaret and, after hearing what she went through, im glad she survived to tell her tale.In the end Margaret comes to terms with who she is and the world around her. Even her wieght is no longer an issue. ###""Loosing ten pounds is a full time job so im handing in my two weeks notice and walking out the door.""### She even has some funny revelations. She tells a story of one of her first jobs was presenting on a lesbian cruise. She says she slept with one of the women on board so she ###""...went through this whole thing am i straight? Am i gay? And then i realized, im just slutty.""### Through the pain Margaret is still able to joke about herself. And the impressions of her mother are always worth the watch.

If you are like me and think that her jokes will only appeal to gays, lesbians and Asians, you are flat out wrong.  In an almost Lenny Bruce-like fashion, without as much fire and brimstone, Margaret Cho nails her jokes with ease, flair and an almost deceptively devlish good-girl grin.  I took a chance and bought this DVD after hearing good things about the movie release.  Not only am I thrilled I did, but I have since shared it with friends and family just to re-experience moments that are rarely seen in stand up comedy.

Berg ""Rob""","[11, 11]","I must admit that there were a few segments during this show that I was in literal pain, clutching my stomach with one hand, and hitting my lap with the other, incapable of breathing, and incapable of controlling my laughter. This was, without a doubt, one of the funniest, most brutally honest stand-up comedy shows I have ever seen. And yet, I would not want to label it as &quot;stand-up comedy,&quot; since it was something much deeper and profound. This was not the expected list of witticisms and observations about society and pop culture that most people expect stand-up comedy to be. This is one woman's deep, penetrating look into herself, at good times and horrible times. She tells things to her audience about herself that most people would be too ashamed to say, but it is her hope that by revealing the bad things about her past, she can help others in her position. She talks about the discrimination she suffered, based both on her race and her weight, she talks about a long period of depression, boozing and drugging she went through, she talks about the producers of &quot;All-American Girl,&quot; her short-lived sitcom, and how they coerced her to lose 35 pounds in 2 weeks, causing her kidneys to collapse...All of this sounds like this show is a real downer. But, ya know what? It isn't. This, as I said before, is also one of the funniest performances I have ever seen. She finds humor in even the bleakest of situations. It is a real testament to her that she found a way to make dark situation funny, and yet not mock the situations themselves, or herself. She strikes a delicate balance between pathos and comedy, and does so perfectly. Having survived a dark period in her life and come out on top, she can now look back on it from a different perspective. And it is one worth hearing, especially for young actors or actresses who feel they have to change themselves in order to become famous.But I must stress one more time...If you are just in the mood for laughs, do not run away from this film because of the dark parts. Because it is, once again, gutbustingly funny. There will be tears of laughter streaming down your face, and that is a guarantee.Margaret Cho is a great writer. Her routines are so meticulously worded, and in most cases, you cannot foresee her punchlines. She throws you for a loop everytime, making the jokes even  funnier and more brilliant. And you must SEE her perform as well. Her facial expressions are priceless. And her accents are wonderful: her Valley Girl impression, her black gay guy impression, and of course, her impression of her Korean-born mother, which is both touching and hilarious.I recommend you purchase rather than rent this concert. I have watched it repeatedly, and it is still as funny as the first time I saw it. I always liked Margaret Cho, but this one DVD has made me a huge fan of hers.

In a climate that favors thin, blonde women, Cho had to work doubly hard to gain respect, but despite her efforts, she faced adversity at every turn.  Probably the most humiliating blow was when one of the producers hired a consultant to help Cho appear to be ""more Asian.""  This, compounded with her rotund figure, led to some serious self-esteem issues and began a steady physical and emotional deterioration.

You are completely captivated by her open, honest, ""take no prisoners"" style of stand up comedy. The fact that she happens to be side-splittingly funny as well is just the icing on the cake. Ms. Cho discusses a vast range of topics including her failed television series, gay porn, her problems with alcohol and drugs, racism, being a ""fag-hag"", and of course, her trade-mark impersonation of her mother (""Are you gaaaaay?""). Her comedy is quite obviously derived from her personal experiences and the fact that she can put such a comedic spin on her day to day life is a testimonial to the kind of person she really is. Ms. Cho has the ability to take life's most embarassing or awkward moments and turn them into relatable topics everyone can identify with and therefore laugh at.My only problem with the DVD is that her dialogue occasionally drifts into areas that are quite obviously painful periods in her life and her anger, hurt and frustration come through in her monologue, and although these emotions are quite justifiable, I question whether a ""stand-up comedy"" routine is the best place to express these injustices. After relating these rather depressing stories, I found it took me two or three jokes before I could get back into the rhythm of her comedy and start laughing again (her hurt and anger when relating these stories is that apparent).The DVD is a high quality product with good audio and visuals.
