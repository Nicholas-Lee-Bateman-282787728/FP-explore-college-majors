I think that the film would have benefitted from tighter editing as it seems to become repetitive in relating the story of infertility.  It could be upsetting to those couples who are in the process of trying to adopt.  Otherwise the film does depict the trial and error of adoptions which can cause upsetting consequences for the natural birth mother and the adoptive parents.

1397438,A328S9RN3U5M68,B004DTLK76,Grady Harp,"[1, 1]","LIKE DANDELION DUST is a very small scaled film about a very large subject: adoption and the struggles that at times are associated between birth parents and adoptive parents. Adapted from Karen Kingsbury's popular novel by Stephen J Rivele and Michael Lachance and directed with sensitivity and fine pacing by Jon Gunn, the film succeeds primarily because of the exceptional acting on the part of the acting by Mira Sorvino and Barry Pepper.Blue collar worker Richard 'Rip' Porter (Barry Pepper) is an alcoholic with anger management problems and as the film opens he is arrested for beating his wife Wendy (Mira Sorvino) and imprisoned for seven years. Simultaneously we meet the wealthy  Jack Campbell (Cole Hauser) and his wife Molly (Kate Levering) who are playing with their six year old son Joey (Maxwell Perry Cotton) and interacting with Molly's sister Beth (Abby Brammell) and husband Bill (Kirk B.R. Woller) who are suggesting that Joey, being adopted, should be brought up in the church: there is conflict as Beth seems to feel Molly isn't caring correctly for Joey since he is adopted!Rip is released form prison and is clean from his alcoholism and anger management problems and Wendy confesses that when Rip was incarcerated she had been pregnant and because of Rip's problems she put her newborn son up for adoption, having her mother sign for Rip.  Rip is shocked with the news and at once wants to get his son back. An adoption agency is consulted in the person of Allyson Bower (L. Scott Caldwell) who is placed between the Porters and the Campbells in making the decision as to where Joey should be.  Because of the forged adoption papers Joey is still the child of the Porters and they fight the Campbells for custody.  Joey is in the middle and with Allyson's guidance tries to adapt to his birth parents on planned visits while the Campbells try every avenue to retain their beloved Joey.  How the game is played includes errors on the parts of both sets of parents but the situation is finally resolved in a very touching manner.Sorvino and Pepper are brilliant in their roles as the beleaguered Porters.  The reason the film works as well as it does is the fact that the good and bad aspects of human behavior on the part of all the characters in the film is balanced.  It is a realistic look at what appears on the surface to be polar opposite couples - and in the middle is the very finely tuned performance of little Maxwell Perry Cotton.  This is a film that tugs a bit heavily on the heartstrings, but for anyone who has been involved in an adoption problem it will ring true.

Don't get me wrong: the acting was superb and the story heart-wrenching, but it was also very depressing. It lacked that spark that the book had.

1397440,A1EA7VXIUZBYIK,B004DTLK76,"Jason Brown ""Dark-edged Apologist""","[1, 1]","I'll admit, I thought I knew who would win it before I even watched the movie (I hadn't read the book in other words, still haven't, haven't got a chance yet). Things don't turn out as you expect. This is the second movie to do that that I've bought (the first being Sucker Punch), so it made it all the more enjoyable- ruining expectations while providing entertainment.First hearing of Karen Kingsbury and seeing the covers of her books, I thought she may have been one of these completely traditional Christian authors. Then I checked out some of her writing, only to find out she does have gritty material. Watching this movie was no different- a husband going to jail after committing domestic violence after being drunk (and getting arrested), couples getting into heavy arguments (neither of which are that much into Christianity, but that shouldn't matter), and different forms of bribing.When Richard ""Rip"" Porter gets of jail, his wife, Wendy, informs him that they had a child but, due to the circumstances then, she gave up their son for adoption. Now they want their child back. Only theirson's life with his adoptive family's a polar opposite from what they could have imagined- wealthy, blue-collar, a boat, they seem to have it all, yet get irritated when any friend tries to ask them to come to their church.So begins the clash of the backgrounds, with bribes (either directly or through a politician wanting to do the right thing and can't believe his friend's lack of tact) and temptations to go back to dangerous habits.Now, in case anyone gets on this movie's case for being ""religious"", my brother has enjoyed all my movies thus far and he hates religion, keep that in mind. He's apathetic abotut eh world and wishes Christianity would die off yet he enjoys my Christian movies without scoffing at any mention of God, Jesus, life, love, etc. that Christians are known for. This one was no exception.I'll definitely admit that, though he's not in my top 5 fave actors, I do like Barry Pepper's acting (especially in Unknown as ""Rancher Shirt"" and Saving Private Ryan) as a struggling alcoholic trying to quit despite being harassed by Jack Campbell. I also liked how realistic Mira Sorvino's acting as Wendy was, as well as how emotional she got at the right times and her character's dilemma between her love for her child and deciding what the right thing to do was. Yes, I enjoyed Mira Sorvino in Mimic and The Final Cut (also one of the finest films where Robin Williams was actually serious instead of a comedian).This film also shows how easy the legal system can be to manipulate and how easily manipulated the Church can be on any circumstance and how far people will go (without shame) to use one another for ulterior motives, no matter the meaning behind the motive.The only thing I didn't like were a couple dry spots where it didn't feel quite organic enough to be believable. In a way that's surprising since Karen Kingsbury, who does great books, was on set to help out with the directing of the scenes and said in an interview that she wouldn't have changed a scene (so for the 1-star ratings who hated the film and said it wasn't like the book might as well dislike Karen since she enjoyed the production of the movie itself). And if anyone tries to condemn the film for being preachy, keep in mind- I can't stand traditionalism in the slightest and, though a scene does take place in an old-fashioned church, there's no preachiness (but a great choir singing), and having met the author personally, I can say that she is not a preachy girl at all, but very down-to-earth.

The acting was believable and I loved the message. Parents (both adoptive and biological) would do just about anything for their child. Now, having done a ton of adoptions myself (I was like the social worker in the movie) I felt that the premise was a bit far fetched. Most states would not allow a situation like that to occur, so I can only assume that Ohio law was researched in this case to make such a situation legally plausible. In Arizona, where I live, that scenario wouldn't happen. There are too many laws to prevent such a messed up situation from happening. Now if Joey had been a foster child and not yet adopted, that would be a different situation. Regardless, this movie tugs at the heartstrings and for me the message was good that birth mothers who place their children for adoption are ""loving them enough to let them go"" like the actress in the movie stated toward the end. Having worked with a lot of birth mothers in similar situations I can say that scene was very believable. It's hard, but rewarding to know that the birth mother did the right thing. She may have been with an abusive man, but she was still strong in her own way. She made choices, and her choice was to stay with him. I've seen that happen over and over as well. That said, I appreciated how the movie resolved at the end and how things were handled. And that poor social worker... I felt for her. She had a situation that was very hard to deal with, but she handled it well. I appreciated that, too. Sometimes it's a thankless job to be the one caught in the middle of custody situations. Been there, done that. Overall, this movie was worth seeing,  in my opinion. I really enjoyed it even if it did make me cry as expected. Again, I haven't read the book to compare the two. I don't know how close the novel was to the movie, so I can't comment on that. The spiritual message in the story was weak, but I'm not surprised. On the flip side, it's good to show that people who aren't Christians love their children enough to sacrifice for them, too. And this adoptive couple was willing to give up everything. That showed their heart for their child, even if their way of handling things was misguided.

It brings together an all star cast including Mira Sorvino, Barry Pepper, and Cole Hauser. It tells the story of the unconditional love of parents, and the things that we would all sacrifice to keep the child we love safe and loved.In ""Like Dandelion Dust"" a six year old boy named Joey finds himself torn between the adoptive parents who have raised him since birth, and the biological parents that are trying to get him back due to a technical glitch in the original adoption papers.  Through out the movie, I found myself relating to both sets of parents. The biological family is poor and the father has a  history of abuse. But you can see how hard he is trying to change and give the son he always wanted the life he deserves. Its only when the adoptive parents confront him with a terrible offer that he loses his self control and goes back to the bottle. The adoptive parents have everything they ever wanted, but all their money can't save them from losing the son they adore. They will do anything to keep him, even if it means running for their lives.With each and every scene, I found myself sniffing. As a mother myself, I can't imagine the pain of having your child taken from you or having to give him up to keep him safe. The actors bring to life this amazing drama with warmth and heart felt emotion. Its a movie you definitely won't want to miss.  It will teach you the true meaning of love and sacrifice.**Complimentary copy received in exchange for an honest review***",4,Get out the tissue box.,1370649600,"06 8, 2013",2013,1610,"['Get', 'out', 'tissue', 'box', 'Dandelion', 'Dust', 'one', 'movies', 'will', 'have', 'teary', 'eyed', 'beginning', 'end', 'together', 'star', 'cast', 'including', 'Mira', 'Sorvino', 'Barry', 'Pepper', 'Cole', 'Hauser', 'story', 'unconditional', 'love', 'parents', 'things', 'would', 'sacrifice', 'keep', 'child', 'love', 'safe', 'loved.In', 'Dandelion', 'Dust', 'six', 'year', 'old', 'boy', 'named', 'Joey', 'torn', 'adoptive', 'parents', 'who', 'have', 'raised', 'birth', 'biological', 'parents', 'are', 'trying', 'get', 'back', 'due', 'technical', 'glitch', 'original', 'adoption', 'papers', 'movie', 'found', 'relating', 'sets', 'parents', 'biological', 'family', 'poor', 'father', 'history', 'abuse', 'can', 'see', 'how', 'hard', 'trying', 'change', 'give', 'son', 'always', 'wanted', 'life', 'only', 'when', 'adoptive', 'parents', 'confront', 'terrible', 'offer', 'self', 'control', 'back', 'bottle', 'adoptive', 'parents', 'have', 'everything', 'ever', 'wanted', 'money', 'ca', ""n't"", 'save', 'losing', 'son', 'adore', 'will', 'do', 'anything', 'keep', 'even', 'running', 'lives.With', 'scene', 'found', 'sniffing', 'mother', 'ca', ""n't"", 'imagine', 'pain', 'having', 'child', 'taken', 'having', 'give', 'up', 'keep', 'safe', 'actors', 'bring', 'life', 'amazing', 'drama', 'warmth', 'heart', 'felt', 'emotion', 'movie', 'definitely', 'wo', ""n't"", 'want', 'miss', 'will', 'teach', 'true', 'meaning', 'love', 'sacrifice', '**Complimentary', 'copy', 'received', 'exchange', 'honest', 'review***']",Like Dandelion Dust

The acting was good all the way around. I was bawling like a baby at the end of it. I thought it was a very moving, intense film that made you think.(In reading a lot of the reviews I understand people are upset because they left the Christian theme, which was prominent in the book, out of the movie.  I haven't read the book, but my guess is they did that to reach a wider audience and not alienate anyone. My friend, who is a Christian, watched it also and we talked about that and her view was that as a Christian she understood the goal to reach out to all, not just limit it to her religion.

Heinen,"[1, 1]","I thought this was a heart-wrenching and, at times, disturbing movie, but extremely well-done and worthwhile--not to mention suspenseful.The movie portrays any adoptive parents' worst nightmare:  someone comes to your house and takes your beloved child away because the adoption agreement was forged many years ago.  The adoptive parents, out of sheer desperation, do everything they can think of to get their child back.The birth parents, on the other hand, are also presented sympathetically.  After the husband is jailed for domestic abuse, the wife who, unknown to husband, is now pregnant, forges his name on the adoption papers so she can give the child away for the child's own good.  A few year's later, husband is released from prison, sober and determined to be a great husband to his long-suffering wife and start a family with her.  His wife reveals that they have a son who was given up for adoption.  Husband, realizing that he did not consent to the adoption, challenges it in court and wins.The rest of the movie shows the adoptive parents doing everything they can to get their son back, while the birth parents do everything they can to earn the love of and make a home for their reluctant son, to whom they are complete strangers.I thought it was a highly compelling film.  All of the characters were easy to relate to and sympathize with, but with visible and understandable flaws as well.  The ability to sympathize with all of the characters and their individual dilemmas is really what makes this movie work so well.  As a viewer, it was hard to know how it should end, because you were rooting for all of the characters.Some will view this as a Christian movie.  I don't really see it that way, although there are certainly a number of Biblical applications one can draw from the film.  If you are not drawn to Christian films, I don't think this film will offend or alientate you.  If you are, you will readily see the Christian principles/values at work.I thought this was a great film, and I really enjoyed it and was moved by it.  Give it a try.  You won't be sorry.It probably is not suitable for elementary school children (my youngest is 11, and I think it would bother her at this point) due to the portrayal of domestic abuse and the trauma of parent-child separation.  May also contain some (fairly mild) profanity.
