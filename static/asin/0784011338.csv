75297,A1R8LZYZR3377O,0784011338,ajsteele,"[1, 1]","""Millennium"" is an 80s sci fi masterpiece that examines time travel with such uniqueness that any and all cheese connected to the era becomes a worthwhile embrace. I don't think the concept of using airplane victims to preserve our future has ever been put on film, but it gets delivered pointedly in this back shelf treasure.The film really works and with Cheryl Ladd giving the performance of her career You get time travel with sex appeal and sincerity. Ms. Ladd had the potential to be a Holllywood film star, but either by choice, talent or fate, she ended up in Hallmark movies and sub par TV shows. This movie proves however that my prior sentence has no place in this universe. She sells the character of Louise Baltimore from the future in the most convincingly appealing of ways.Kris Kristofferson is also on his game while Daniel J Travanti has some powerful sci fi grounding scenes. An offbeat future world containing a weird array of thought provoking characters including a believably fake robot named Sherman (that is the epitome of 80s cool to look at) should satiate your distant future doldrums.The story flows logically with limitations while the wonderfully natural aura of the film dumps paradoxes, time travel gates, duplicate persons, swirling colors and retro future technology into the thought pleasing synapses of your brain. 1989 was a good year because of this flick. Creative brilliance all around from directing to acting. Engrossing and ahead of its time. Lets get some behind the scenes snippets and directors commentary with Cheryl Ladd chiming in before the world ends.

Most of the political comments about air safety in the book, particularly those about the battle between Ronald Reagan and the air traffic controllers did not make it into this film, and neither did the quasi-religious aspects of the book. But most of the guts of the story did.In particular, the film is faithful to the plot and tone of the novel, including both the central romance and some of the most gripping action scenes. Both the book and the film captures brilliantly some of the most memorable scenes in the story, and incorporate one or two quite funny moments, none of which I can begin to describe without spoiling the story.Kris Kristofferson is excellent as an air crash investigator, who discovers some unusual anomalies in the wreck of an aircraft. Cheryl Ladd is equally brilliant as the mysterious woman who sleeps with him and then disappears. As the story continues we learn more about the investigator's past, and why the mysterious woman reminds him so much of someone he remembers from his childhood.I can recommend both the book and the film.

75321,ANAYSRE3LX8GZ,0784011338,Micheal Hunt,"[34, 37]","I would have never seen this movie had my girlfriend not have picked it out of the cheapie bin, 'cause she saw it years ago, and was surprised I'd never heard of it.The plot is about a cop (Kris Kristoperson) who is investigating a plane crash & finds some weird things from the crash site. Time travelers from the future come back to rescue people, but during one of their procedures, something goes wrong and one of them is killed and accidentally drops a futuristic device. Once they return to their future, a paradox shift in the universe rumbles through them and they realize they must send someone back to retrieve the device before someone works out how to use it and 'causes more ripples in the universe. (Creating more paradox's) One of the time travelers is Cheryl Ladd (Charlies Angels) she is sent back to retrieve the device and also try to stop Kris from investigating the plane wreck on a certain day. However when she thinks she failed, she then returns to the future, but if she had of stayed 10 more seconds she would have succeeded, so more ripples occur and so on.I thought it was interesting to question what would happen if time travel was actually possible. Then depending on WHAT you change in the past, how does that affect the future? I must say it's not as funny as when Homer Simpson traveled through time with his toaster and kept changing things, but on a more serious level I thought it was interesting where this movie went with it's approach.The special effects aren't too bad, considering it is a late 80's movie. A few people criticize the future scenes as being ugly.... They're supposed to be! The future in this movie is a dirty place, polluted so badly that smoking cigarettes is a breath of fresh air. (Now do you get it?). The elders where being kept alive in their tubes and that future is erased by the end of the film so that it never happened anyway which is what every futuristic movie needs to do because anybody's vision of the future will always be highly criticized for numerous reasons.BONUS FEATURES:Look Ma, someone decided to talk about them!The bonus features contain a trailer, a biography of the actors, and production notes. What I found to be very unique about the bios and notes was the text on screen is actually read to you! I've never seen that on any other DVD before, and I think more DVD's should have that on them.On the production notes, when you reach the last page, there is an option to view the alternate ending. I give that bonus feature 1 star for the way it's shown. It spends 5 minutes showing the end scene again until they show about 2 seconds of what they call the ""alternate ending"". If anybody skips the production notes they wont even know there is an alternate ending on the DVD. And if they read the cover that says it's on there, they'd probably wonder where it is? Either the cover shouldn't have said it and it became an EGG or they should have made it a proper (easier accessible) option.People who criticize this film are just showing their lack of understanding a plot that went right over their heads. The idea to show scenes again from a different angle is interesting, and seeing a women come back from the future and reacts to things she has never done before, is also pretty interesting... sure, they could have expanded further with all that, but this film is what it is and as long as you sit down with an open mind and stop concentrating on nitpicking how un-logical things are in this film (yet you probably think the Matrix makes sense) just watch the story unfold instead of worrying about how YOU would have directed things, why not just watch it for fun instead of looking for flaws, you might actually enjoy the film!",3,Interesting.,1119916800,"06 28, 2005",2005,3721,"['would', 'have', 'never', 'seen', 'movie', 'had', 'girlfriend', 'not', 'have', 'picked', 'cheapie', 'bin', 'saw', 'years', 'ago', 'was', 'surprised', ""'d"", 'never', 'heard', 'it.The', 'plot', 'cop', 'Kris', 'Kristoperson', 'who', 'investigating', 'plane', 'crash', 'weird', 'things', 'crash', 'site', 'Time', 'travelers', 'future', 'come', 'back', 'rescue', 'people', 'one', 'procedures', 'something', 'wrong', 'one', 'killed', 'accidentally', 'futuristic', 'device', 'return', 'future', 'paradox', 'shift', 'universe', 'rumbles', 'realize', 'must', 'send', 'someone', 'back', 'retrieve', 'device', 'someone', 'out', 'how', 'use', 'more', 'ripples', 'universe', 'Creating', 'more', 'paradox', 'One', 'time', 'travelers', 'Cheryl', 'Ladd', 'Charlies', 'Angels', 'sent', 'back', 'retrieve', 'device', 'also', 'try', 'stop', 'Kris', 'investigating', 'plane', 'wreck', 'certain', 'day', 'However', 'when', 'failed', 'then', 'future', 'had', 'stayed', '10', 'more', 'seconds', 'would', 'have', 'succeeded', 'so', 'more', 'ripples', 'occur', 'so', 'on.I', 'thought', 'was', 'interesting', 'question', 'what', 'would', 'happen', 'time', 'travel', 'was', 'actually', 'possible', 'Then', 'depending', 'WHAT', 'change', 'past', 'how', 'affect', 'future', 'must', 'say', 'not', 'as', 'funny', 'when', 'Homer', 'Simpson', 'traveled', 'time', 'toaster', 'kept', 'changing', 'things', 'more', 'serious', 'level', 'thought', 'was', 'interesting', 'where', 'movie', 'went', 'approach.The', 'special', 'effects', 'are', ""n't"", 'too', 'bad', 'considering', 'late', '80', 'movie', 'few', 'people', 'criticize', 'future', 'being', 'ugly', ""'re"", 'supposed', 'be', 'future', 'movie', 'dirty', 'place', 'polluted', 'so', 'badly', 'smoking', 'cigarettes', 'breath', 'fresh', 'air', 'Now', 'do', 'get', 'elders', 'where', 'being', 'kept', 'alive', 'tubes', 'future', 'erased', 'end', 'film', 'never', 'happened', 'anyway', 'what', 'futuristic', 'movie', 'needs', 'do', 'anybody', 'vision', 'future', 'will', 'always', 'be', 'highly', 'criticized', 'numerous', 'reasons.BONUS', 'FEATURES', 'Look', 'Ma', 'someone', 'decided', 'talk', 'bonus', 'contain', 'trailer', 'biography', 'actors', 'production', 'notes', 'What', 'found', 'be', 'very', 'unique', 'bios', 'notes', 'was', 'text', 'screen', 'actually', 'read', ""'ve"", 'never', 'seen', 'other', 'DVD', 'think', 'more', 'DVD', 'should', 'have', 'them.On', 'production', 'notes', 'when', 'reach', 'last', 'page', 'option', 'view', 'alternate', 'ending', 'give', 'bonus', 'feature', '1', 'star', 'way', 'shown', '5', 'minutes', 'showing', 'end', 'scene', 'again', 'show', '2', 'seconds', 'what', 'call', 'alternate', 'ending', 'anybody', 'production', 'wont', 'even', 'know', 'alternate', 'ending', 'DVD', 'read', 'cover', ""'d"", 'probably', 'wonder', 'where', 'cover', 'should', ""n't"", 'have', 'said', 'became', 'EGG', 'should', 'have', 'made', 'proper', 'easier', 'accessible', 'option.People', 'who', 'film', 'are', 'just', 'showing', 'lack', 'understanding', 'plot', 'went', 'right', 'heads', 'idea', 'show', 'scenes', 'again', 'different', 'angle', 'interesting', 'seeing', 'women', 'come', 'back', 'future', 'reacts', 'things', 'never', 'done', 'before', 'also', 'pretty', 'interesting', 'sure', 'could', 'have', 'expanded', 'further', 'film', 'what', 'as', 'long', 'sit', 'down', 'open', 'mind', 'stop', 'concentrating', 'nitpicking', 'how', 'un-logical', 'things', 'are', 'film', 'yet', 'probably', 'think', 'Matrix', 'sense', 'just', 'watch', 'story', 'unfold', 'instead', 'worrying', 'how', 'YOU', 'would', 'have', 'directed', 'things', 'why', 'not', 'just', 'watch', 'fun', 'instead', 'looking', 'flaws', 'might', 'actually', 'enjoy', 'film']",N/A

First, I like both Kristopherson's and Ladd's performances. They fit the characters nicely. The replay of the same sequence from another angle answers all of the questions about what is going on, and is the only thing that turns a rather short, straightforward featurette into a full-length feature.Conceivably, more time could have been spent investigating the wreckage (and similar wreckages) before revealing the time travelers from the future. Also, why don't they fix these ripples, instead of trying to escape them?So there are some questions. If I could, I'd give this one 2-1/2 stars, not three, but I won't drop it all the way to two, mostly because no one else has done this exact story, unless it was Rod Serling in the original Twilight Zone series, but I don't think so... there are similar stories, to be sure, and time travel stories, but not in this combination.Which puts this film into the &quot;Twilight Zone&quot; category for me.

The fun begins when airline-disaster investigator Kristofferson meets mysterious airline employee Ladd while checking out the wreckage of the latest crash. Because Ladd, done up in an appalling perm and enough eyeliner to outfit a pack of raccoons, looks like she's about to shoot The Donna Mills Story, you first suspect Kristofferson might be the weird one -- he invites her to dinner. Then Ladd chain-smokes while eating, a dead giveaway that she's the movie's space case. And that's before she has sex with Kristofferson and gushes, ""You're the best thing in a thousand years!"" Apparently well aware he's not that good in the sack, Kristofferson responds, ""The first rule is: Don't go to bed with anyone crazier than yourself. You're right up there on the top 10 of my Weird List, lady."" To which Ladd replies, ""If you knew me better, I'd be number one."" Then, when Kristofferson's back is turned, Ladd disappears -- literally.Wandering alone in the plane wreckage the day after this romp, Kristofferson comes upon what looks like a futuristic set of brass knuckles. And indeed, when he touches it, he's knocked out! Then, lo, a tacky blue hologram appears in the air, and Ladd steps out of it in S&M; Tinkerbellesque regalia with a hairdo shaped like a giant Foster's Freeze soft ice cream swirl. Yes, Ladd is actually a human visitor from a thousand years into the future. She's here on a mission to -- well, let her tell it: ""We're all dying. We can't have children anymore. We steal people from the past and send them somewhere else to start over, to give them a second chance."" That's right: Ladd takes airline passengers who are about to crash and transports them to the future. But what about the dead bodies found after the crash? Ladd simply brings a supply of look-alike corpses from the future to leave behind in the live passengers' seats. Ah, but how does she get the passengers to cooperate? Well, that's what the brass knuckles are for, dummy.Alas, two of the stunner devices were left behind on this latest crash and Ladd's got to retrieve them or ""a paradox"" will occur and destroy the future. A what? As Nobel Prize-winning physicist Daniel J. Travanti explains, ""Say you build a time machine, go back, and murder your father when he was 10 years old. That means you were never born, and if you weren't, how did you build the time machine?"" See, this is why Ladd was willing to sleep with Kristofferson - she thought he had the devices. So when Kristofferson sees the futuristic Ladd in the plane wreckage, she's still after the stunner, which she finds and takes with her in her tacky blue time-travel hologram before Kristofferson can ask her on a second date. Later, it turns out that Dr. Travanti has the second scanner, but when Ladd appears from the future this time, Travanti accidentally zaps himself to death with it. For reasons you really don't want to know, this causes the dreaded paradox, which compels Ladd to take Kristofferson back to her future world, where everything is rapidly coming apart -- which is hardly surprising since it's one of the cheapest-looking sets ever seen in a sci-fi pic. Just before the world explodes, Ladd resets the time-travel dial so she and Kristofferson can go even further into the future -- in hopes of more convincing production design, better scripts and more flattering hairstyles.",5,Cheese Whip Supreme!,1186704000,"08 10, 2007",2007,3625,"['little', 'strange', 'big-budget', 'sci-fi', 'extravaganza', 'aspiring', 'be', 'first', 'gate', 'millennial', 'doomsday', 'theme', 'starred', 'Cheryl', 'Ladd', 'Kris', 'Kristofferson', ""'re"", 'already', 'right', 'mood', '1989', 'time-travel', 'howler', 'Millennium', 'fun', 'when', 'airline-disaster', 'investigator', 'Kristofferson', 'mysterious', 'airline', 'employee', 'Ladd', 'checking', 'out', 'wreckage', 'latest', 'crash', 'Ladd', 'done', 'up', 'appalling', 'perm', 'enough', 'eyeliner', 'outfit', 'pack', 'raccoons', 'shoot', 'Donna', 'Mills', 'Story', 'first', 'suspect', 'Kristofferson', 'might', 'be', 'weird', 'one', 'dinner', 'Then', 'Ladd', 'chain-smokes', 'eating', 'dead', 'giveaway', 'movie', 'space', 'case', 'sex', 'Kristofferson', 'gushes', ""'re"", 'best', 'thing', 'thousand', 'years', 'Apparently', 'well', 'aware', 'not', 'good', 'sack', 'Kristofferson', 'first', 'rule', 'Do', ""n't"", 'go', 'bed', 'anyone', 'crazier', ""'re"", 'right', 'up', 'there', 'top', '10', 'Weird', 'List', 'lady', 'Ladd', 'replies', 'knew', 'better', ""'d"", 'be', 'number', 'one', 'Then', 'when', 'Kristofferson', 'back', 'turned', 'Ladd', 'literally.Wandering', 'alone', 'plane', 'wreckage', 'day', 'romp', 'Kristofferson', 'what', 'futuristic', 'set', 'brass', 'knuckles', 'indeed', 'when', 'knocked', 'out', 'Then', 'lo', 'tacky', 'blue', 'hologram', 'air', 'Ladd', 'S', 'M', 'Tinkerbellesque', 'hairdo', 'shaped', 'giant', 'Foster', 'Freeze', 'soft', 'ice', 'cream', 'swirl', 'Yes', 'Ladd', 'actually', 'human', 'visitor', 'thousand', 'years', 'future', 'here', 'mission', 'well', 'let', 'tell', ""'re"", 'dying', 'ca', ""n't"", 'have', 'children', 'anymore', 'steal', 'people', 'past', 'send', 'somewhere', 'else', 'start', 'give', 'second', 'chance', 'right', 'Ladd', 'airline', 'passengers', 'who', 'are', 'crash', 'transports', 'future', 'what', 'dead', 'bodies', 'found', 'crash', 'Ladd', 'simply', 'supply', 'look-alike', 'corpses', 'future', 'leave', 'behind', 'live', 'passengers', 'seats', 'Ah', 'how', 'get', 'passengers', 'cooperate', 'Well', 'what', 'brass', 'knuckles', 'are', 'dummy.Alas', 'two', 'stunner', 'devices', 'were', 'left', 'behind', 'latest', 'crash', 'Ladd', 'got', 'retrieve', 'paradox', 'will', 'occur', 'destroy', 'future', 'what', 'Nobel', 'Prize-winning', 'physicist', 'Daniel', 'J.', 'Travanti', 'Say', 'build', 'time', 'machine', 'go', 'back', 'murder', 'father', 'when', 'was', '10', 'years', 'old', 'were', 'never', 'born', 'were', ""n't"", 'how', 'did', 'build', 'time', 'machine', 'See', 'why', 'Ladd', 'was', 'willing', 'sleep', 'Kristofferson', 'thought', 'had', 'devices', 'So', 'when', 'Kristofferson', 'futuristic', 'Ladd', 'plane', 'wreckage', 'still', 'stunner', 'tacky', 'blue', 'time-travel', 'hologram', 'Kristofferson', 'can', 'ask', 'second', 'date', 'Later', 'out', 'Dr.', 'Travanti', 'second', 'scanner', 'when', 'Ladd', 'future', 'time', 'Travanti', 'accidentally', 'death', 'reasons', 'really', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'know', 'dreaded', 'paradox', 'Ladd', 'take', 'Kristofferson', 'back', 'future', 'world', 'where', 'everything', 'rapidly', 'coming', 'apart', 'hardly', 'surprising', 'one', 'cheapest-looking', 'sets', 'ever', 'seen', 'sci-fi', 'pic', 'Just', 'world', 'Ladd', 'time-travel', 'dial', 'Kristofferson', 'can', 'go', 'even', 'further', 'future', 'hopes', 'more', 'convincing', 'production', 'design', 'better', 'scripts', 'more', 'flattering', 'hairstyles']",N/A

75337,A2L2VMN8C941H7,0784011338,"Walter R. Johnson ""Spaceman""","[5, 5]","First, let me say that I've been a science fiction aficionado for decades.  However, my main interest has been book science fiction because the vast majority of so-called science fiction movies and TV shows have been very light (or nonexistent) on the science and over the top on the fiction (or rather fantasy).I do give the makers of the movie ""Millennium"" credit for at least trying to explain such an arcane subject as time travel.  Of course, I wouldn't have expected the movie to be as detailed as was the book and it wasn't.  The sets depicting the future world were supposed to give a sense of decadence, and they did.  I applaud the production designer(s) for not opting for the usual shiny, glitzy ""future"" - especially in 1989.  I don't think they were imaginative enough, but that's a highly subjective appraisal and they were probably on a budget.Many reviewers have complained about the so-called ""flashbacks"" showing the same scene from different points of view.  That wasn't the director being ""artistic.""  The different points of view were necessary to show that the different characters (primarily Bill Smith and Louise Baltimore) were each at different points on their personal time-lines even though they were in the same room together.  For example, After Bill Smith and Louise Baltimore have spent the night together, Bill finds the lost stunner in the wreckage of the airliner that has been deposited in a hangar.  He fiddles with it and is paralyzed by it, but he can still breathe and see.  After Bill has been lying on the floor for a while, Louise appears from the future with her snatch team.  Bill recognizes her immediately, but she does NOT recognize him.  This is because their shack-up in the hotel room is in his past, but is in Louise's future - they are at different points in their personal time-lines.  And Louise's personal time-line will become even more tangled.
