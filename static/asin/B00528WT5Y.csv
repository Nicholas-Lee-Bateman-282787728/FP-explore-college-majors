But not exactly.  Widowed mom Shirley Partridge and family begin performing music to make ends meet and soon they're a super groovy act cruising around in a mod bus.  They are the one's which prompted the Bradys to form a group but were not nearly as successful as the Partridges.  In real life even.  Tragically The band broke when David Cassidy did not want to be in the band anymore and wanted to go solo singing rock &#34;rock&#34; music.  He knew some success in England as such.  But the pop-rock his fans loved him for in America would insure he'd never be forgotten in music as well as TV.

Managed by the easily exasperated RUEBEN KINKAID (DAVE MADDEN)...at least when DANNY BONADUCE's ""mental midget"" character DANNY wasn't usurping his authority...the cast also included SUSAN DEY as elder sister (and frequent CASSIDY sparring partner) LAURIE and low key moppets CHRIS and TRACEY, who rarely figured into the plot lines. Shuttling to supper club gigs in a multi-colored school bus, THE PARTRIDGE FAMILY dispensed their innocuous brand of bubble-pop...notably real life chart topper I THINK I LOVE YOU and a series of best selling albums (on which only CASSIDY and JONES performed)...to millions of young fans jonesing for a sugar fix ever since THE MONKEES' unceremonious cancellation a couple of years earlier.RATING: FOUR BLACK VESTS",4,BIRDS OF A FEATHER,1389916800,"01 17, 2014",2014,1091,"['PARTRIDGE', 'FAMILY-THE', 'COMPLETE', 'SERIES', 'Ultimately', 'hipper', 'THE', 'BRADY', 'BUNCH', 'kid-com', 'followed', 'late', 'sixties', 'THE', 'PARTRIDGE', 'FAMILY', 'was', 'based', 'real', 'life', 'hit', 'making', 'clan', 'THE', 'COWSILLS', 'INDIAN', 'LAKE', 'HAIR', 'starring', 'shag-a-delic', 'heartthrob', 'DAVID', 'CASSIDY', 'KEITH', 'PARTRIDGE', 'real', 'life', 'step', 'mom', 'Oscar', 'winner', 'SHIRLEY', 'JONES', 'Managed', 'easily', 'exasperated', 'RUEBEN', 'KINKAID', 'DAVE', 'MADDEN', 'least', 'when', 'DANNY', 'BONADUCE', 'mental', 'midget', 'character', 'DANNY', 'was', ""n't"", 'usurping', 'authority', 'cast', 'also', 'included', 'SUSAN', 'DEY', 'elder', 'sister', 'frequent', 'CASSIDY', 'sparring', 'partner', 'LAURIE', 'low', 'key', 'moppets', 'CHRIS', 'TRACEY', 'who', 'rarely', 'figured', 'plot', 'lines', 'Shuttling', 'supper', 'club', 'gigs', 'multi-colored', 'school', 'bus', 'THE', 'PARTRIDGE', 'FAMILY', 'dispensed', 'innocuous', 'brand', 'bubble-pop', 'notably', 'real', 'life', 'chart', 'THINK', 'LOVE', 'YOU', 'series', 'best', 'selling', 'albums', 'only', 'CASSIDY', 'JONES', 'performed', 'millions', 'young', 'fans', 'jonesing', 'sugar', 'fix', 'ever', 'THE', 'MONKEES', 'unceremonious', 'cancellation', 'couple', 'years', 'earlier.RATING', 'FOUR', 'BLACK', 'VESTS']",The Partridge Family (The Complete Series - Seasons 1-4)

It would have been nice if Sony had added another disc and included the short lived Bobby Sherman series titled Getting Together (which was spawned from an episode of the Partridge Family). Also it would have been fun to have old network promos the cast did, out takes, bloopers etc. Anything extra. Seems the studios have no imagination anymore when they release these shows. That being said, I guess we all need to be grateful that they are still putting these out on real DVDs and NOT the crummy Made On Demand DVD-R's. So, if you don't already own the other season specific DVD's, I highly recommend this set, but if you are a life long fan of the show as I am, there is nothing new for you here.",4,Nothing New So I'll Pass...but....,1381795200,"10 15, 2013",2013,811,"['Being', 'already', 'own', 'four', 'individual', 'seasons', 'fun', 'series', 'DVD', 'will', 'pass', 'collection', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'nice', 'Sony', 'had', 'added', 'disc', 'included', 'short', 'lived', 'Bobby', 'Sherman', 'series', 'titled', 'Getting', 'Together', 'was', 'spawned', 'episode', 'Partridge', 'Family', 'Also', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'fun', 'have', 'old', 'network', 'promos', 'cast', 'did', 'bloopers', 'etc', 'Anything', 'extra', 'studios', 'have', 'imagination', 'anymore', 'when', 'release', 'shows', 'being', 'said', 'guess', 'need', 'be', 'grateful', 'are', 'still', 'putting', 'real', 'DVDs', 'NOT', 'crummy', 'Made', 'Demand', 'DVD-R', 'So', 'do', ""n't"", 'already', 'own', 'other', 'season', 'specific', 'DVD', 'highly', 'recommend', 'set', 'are', 'life', 'long', 'fan', 'show', 'am', 'nothing', 'new', 'here']",The Partridge Family (The Complete Series - Seasons 1-4)

So, Why did he agree to do it in the first place? It brought him fame and money, so he should have been grateful. I read of actors complaining and they have what most of us dream about.
