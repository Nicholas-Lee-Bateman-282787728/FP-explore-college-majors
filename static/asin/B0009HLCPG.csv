905633,A1GGOC9PVDXW7Z,B0009HLCPG,Annie Van Auken,"[1, 2]","ALL OVER TOWN (1937) is an ideal introduction to the now forgotten vaudeville team of 'Ole' Olsen and 'Chic' Johnson.It may actually be their best film, for in this one the boys project infinite comfort within their natural environment. The early part of the story occurs at a vaudevillian boarding house, surely the sort of place Chic and Ole knew well. Their joy seems genuine, and get ready for a surprise. These skilled musicians only became jokesters AFTER they teamed up in the 'Teens. Impressive musical abilities are especially evident in Mr. Johnson, who in one scene gives a virtuoso ad-lib piano performance, playing several lightning-fast runs with effortless precision.The meshing of talent is so obvious, for John Olsen and Harold Johnson had been working closely together nearly a quarter-century when ""All Over Town"" was filmed. They play off each other perfectly, have the unison dialogue gimmick down pat and you can see so well that they relish their mutual company and are often amusing each other without trying. These men are a pleasure to watch!As for other cast members, Franklin Pangborn has never seemed so fey as when his costumer lovingly describes a glitzy gown he'll fashion. You can just tell this guy wears his own dresses! Jimmy Finlayson is a bit past his Laurel & Hardy prime, but that dyspeptically squinty Scotsman routine still brings smiles. Jimmy is typecast as MacDougal, owner of a fish cannery and sponsor of the radio program that provides a setting for our BIG FINISH!While the killer runs from cops within the studio and mayhem goes on during a live broadcast, Olsen describes all the action for listeners, as Johnson cheerily chips in with several ""brought to you through the courtesy of MacDougal's Mackeral"" plugs.If you like breezy comedy as presented by genuine craftsmen, you cannot do better than Olsen & Johnson's ALL OVER TOWN. Highly recommended.",4,The unjustly forgotten comedy team,1358553600,"01 19, 2013",2013,1902,"['OVER', 'TOWN', '1937', 'ideal', 'introduction', 'now', 'vaudeville', 'team', ""'Ole"", 'Olsen', ""'Chic"", 'Johnson.It', 'may', 'actually', 'be', 'best', 'film', 'one', 'boys', 'project', 'infinite', 'comfort', 'natural', 'environment', 'early', 'part', 'story', 'vaudevillian', 'boarding', 'house', 'surely', 'sort', 'place', 'Chic', 'Ole', 'knew', 'well', 'joy', 'genuine', 'get', 'ready', 'surprise', 'skilled', 'musicians', 'only', 'became', 'jokesters', 'AFTER', 'teamed', 'up', ""'Teens"", 'Impressive', 'musical', 'abilities', 'are', 'especially', 'evident', 'Mr.', 'Johnson', 'who', 'one', 'scene', 'virtuoso', 'ad-lib', 'piano', 'performance', 'playing', 'several', 'lightning-fast', 'runs', 'effortless', 'precision.The', 'meshing', 'talent', 'so', 'obvious', 'John', 'Olsen', 'Harold', 'Johnson', 'had', 'been', 'working', 'closely', 'together', 'nearly', 'quarter-century', 'when', 'Over', 'Town', 'was', 'filmed', 'play', 'off', 'other', 'perfectly', 'have', 'unison', 'dialogue', 'gimmick', 'down', 'pat', 'can', 'see', 'so', 'well', 'relish', 'mutual', 'company', 'are', 'often', 'amusing', 'other', 'trying', 'men', 'are', 'pleasure', 'watch', 'other', 'cast', 'members', 'Franklin', 'Pangborn', 'never', 'seemed', 'so', 'fey', 'when', 'costumer', 'lovingly', 'glitzy', 'gown', ""'ll"", 'fashion', 'can', 'just', 'tell', 'guy', 'own', 'dresses', 'Jimmy', 'Finlayson', 'bit', 'Laurel', 'Hardy', 'prime', 'dyspeptically', 'squinty', 'Scotsman', 'routine', 'still', 'smiles', 'Jimmy', 'typecast', 'MacDougal', 'owner', 'fish', 'cannery', 'sponsor', 'radio', 'program', 'setting', 'BIG', 'FINISH', 'killer', 'cops', 'studio', 'mayhem', 'live', 'broadcast', 'Olsen', 'action', 'listeners', 'Johnson', 'cheerily', 'chips', 'several', 'brought', 'courtesy', 'MacDougal', 'Mackeral', 'plugs.If', 'breezy', 'comedy', 'presented', 'genuine', 'craftsmen', 'can', 'not', 'do', 'better', 'Olsen', 'Johnson', 'ALL', 'OVER', 'TOWN', 'Highly', 'recommended']",All Over Town

905638,A39GW5CBWTIWAZ,B0009HLCPG,Phil S.,"[1, 1]","It's tempting to give this 1937 comedy three stars, as it features Hal Roach-related players and (apparently) writers and directors, most notably James Finlayson, expertly playing a rattled radio show producer (""McDonald's Mackrels""), who witnesses the craziest audition in show business history, as Olson and Johnson, make several attempts at performing a classical piece for piano and violin - they pla live - but Olson's reliance on the law of averages does not score with the famous Scotsman.Somehow, the failed audition *wins* them a show - but only if the finale will include the announcement of the killer of a reluctant financier.The actual broadcast sequences are when the film really gets in gear and delivers some laughs. (If the viewer can get past an innocent man's murder as a plot element in a wild comedy). Although the film has alot of snappy patter and never slows down, it cannot be said that delivers much mirth, overall.
