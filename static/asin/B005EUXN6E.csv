As much time as I have spent reading history, I have read precious little on the Korean War, and what little I read only mentioned Chosin as part of a larger discussion of the Pusan perimeter.The audacity of the Marines and US Army troops not just to stand and fight, but to accept the orders to basically attack the enemy when obviously the Chinese commanders expected the US soldiers to just sit in place is a terrific story. Thank goodness it has been told. I also had no idea that the US commanders on the scene made the choice to rescue almost 100,000 North Korean civilians from systematic murder by the invading Chinese army.This is a battle as desperate as Stalingrad, but which somehow was skipped in most popular histories. As some of the witnesses interviewed in the documentary said, Korea was not just a forgotten war, but also a forgotten victory.",5,An amazing story,1358294400,"01 16, 2013",2013,948,"['only', 'recently', 'saw', 'documentary', 'first', 'time', 'left', 'lost', 'words', 'much', 'time', 'have', 'spent', 'reading', 'history', 'have', 'read', 'precious', 'little', 'Korean', 'War', 'what', 'little', 'read', 'only', 'mentioned', 'Chosin', 'part', 'larger', 'discussion', 'Pusan', 'perimeter.The', 'audacity', 'Marines', 'US', 'Army', 'not', 'just', 'stand', 'fight', 'accept', 'orders', 'basically', 'attack', 'enemy', 'when', 'obviously', 'Chinese', 'commanders', 'expected', 'US', 'soldiers', 'just', 'sit', 'place', 'terrific', 'story', 'Thank', 'goodness', 'been', 'told', 'also', 'had', 'idea', 'US', 'commanders', 'scene', 'made', 'choice', 'rescue', 'almost', '100,000', 'North', 'Korean', 'civilians', 'systematic', 'murder', 'invading', 'Chinese', 'army.This', 'battle', 'as', 'desperate', 'Stalingrad', 'somehow', 'was', 'skipped', 'most', 'popular', 'histories', 'witnesses', 'interviewed', 'documentary', 'said', 'Korea', 'was', 'not', 'just', 'forgotten', 'war', 'also', 'forgotten', 'victory']",CHOSIN: A Documentary Film by Brian Iglesias

This documentary is a remarkable attempt to help make that right and present this piece of forgotten or ignored history.  Within the Korean War, Chosin was one of the most brutal series of battles, mostly fought by one Marine Regiment.  This documentary interviews a number of veterans of Chosin who describe the battle against the Chinese enemy and the bitter cold.  It will fill you with emotion and pride in our country and its veterans.  The Korean War was a conflict intended to stop the spread of communism and to free the people of Korea.  Looking back today, it accomplished both.  The American and Allied contribution to the people of Korea to keep them free is a remarkable piece of history and demonstrates the goodness of this country.

It is an amazing first-hand accounting of one of the epic battles of The Forgotten War when 15,000 American Marines, Soldiers, and Sailors had to fight their way through 100,000+ Chinese Communists.  It combines intensely personal memories of close quarter combat with the memories of those who had a more strategic view of the battle.  It's gut-wrenching narrative with all the horror and sadness of war but ultimately uplifting with their courage, grace, and humor.

Marines and Soldiers fighting for another moment of life in conditions that would make others turn to mush and dig their own grave! References, pictures, background and video of what has to have been one of the most terrifying yet defining moment in the lives of the warriors who fought these multiple battles and became the Chosin 'Few'.If you stand in awe of such bravery and courage while knowing full well you will probably die, and, as I, simply thank God for this kind of resoluteness and steadfastness under fire, than this movie will be well worth your time. There are not enough accolades to describe such behavior. Outnumbered from day one and often 20 to 1, using the enemy bodies (and sometimes those of your own dead buddies) to build a 'hole' (because the ground could not be dug) to fight from, seeing companies reduced to 15 or 20 functional, carrying the frozen bodies of people who ate a cold dinner with you to the morgue in the morning... and going back up to fight again. I do not know if we, in America, now have the &#34;stuff&#34; that made up these immortal souls (and I know we've had the same kind of &#34;do or die&#34; in Vietnam, the Middle East, Mosul, Fallujah and Nasiriyah, and in the small but heroic battles throughout that region, no disrespect, but we are looking at unprepared,  less trained, 'civilian' warriors at Chosin)Watch this with your grandchildren or children.

I could guess at which units some of the veterans featured in the documentary were from based on those books and what they described.  However, the documentary could have had better editing (not sure if this is the right word) - have the names of the veterans displayed when they first appear on the screen (or if the veterans didn't want that - their company designator).  The names are listed at the end but that makes it very hard to put a face to the name.  Also the disjointed way the interviews were interlaced, made it a little hard to follow each veterans experience.

Brother fought against brother, and families were torn apart. But to this day, my parents will always be grateful to the Americans who came and saved their world, allowed them to pursue their futures and know a life free from oppression-something some of their friends would never experience. It was a war that receives little recognition here, but in the minds of people like my parents, the sacrifice of American soldiers will never be forgotten. Watching a documentary like this one- to see the faces and hear the words of these men- makes me realize that many of us have forgotten the price that many have paid for peace. The documentary's strength lies not in graphic images of death or fighting, but in listening to the memories of these men who endured horrific conditions and frequently overwhelming odds .  Most  of the film is made up of interviews of these veterans, who bear both physical and emotional scars that are still painful after all this time. Their accounts reveal portraits of bravery and kindness interspersed with suffering of both soldiers and civilians. Yes, this is perhaps a very simplified portrayal - no mention is made of the darker side of soldiers and their actions- but that was not the point of this documentary. We need to learn about those early days of the Cold War and remember those men that allowed people like my parents to live in a world of freedom and democracy.
