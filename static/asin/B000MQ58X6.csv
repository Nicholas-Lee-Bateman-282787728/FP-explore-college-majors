1048975,A2SW560X584UEF,B000MQ58X6,Barbara B.,"[4, 4]","With series 6, the show continues what I feel is a gradual slide downward. Gone is the good natured humor and sense of ""place"" that made the first few seasons so special. Now, we're subjected to an hour of bickering and all-too-predictable misunderstandings and jealousy on top of continual romantic musical chairs.Is there any place in the world that really has only unmarried people on the lookout for love? EVERYONE in the series now is single (and most are young and trim: no middle aged or heavy set people -- except those who serve as the comic relief and buffoons -- no happily married couples, no children, no community life.And people sure do get over lost loves REAL fast! I thought Archie was fickle, but fist Golly is deeply dedicated and in love with Molly, then --in two episodes -- it's Meg. Paul loves Lex, then Isabel, then Susan. Jess forgets Duncan real fast when someone new appears.Everytime a new character is introduced, you can spot immediately that he/she will be someone's love interest!  Remember the show Hamish MacBeth? The variety of characters there was so much more interesting and 'real.'Also, there is a complete lack of logic in the storylines. This HUGE estate, which is apparently involved in everything from raising wolves to offering an 'activity center', has almost no staff and no one seems to work!Finally, the show has become, for the most part, ""generic"" in locale. Gone is the glimpse into Scottish clan life and history (hardly anyone even wears a kilt anymore!). Gone are the pipes and the ""feel"" of the country. Change their names from MacDonald to O'Reilly or Le Clerc and you'd never tell the difference.Still, the show has its moments and I continue to watch in hopes that it will regain some of its past allure. And of course, I watch to see glorious shots of beautiful country and to listen to the most marvelous accents!",3,"Still has its moments, but no longer great",1212019200,"05 29, 2008",2008,1874,"['series', '6', 'show', 'what', 'feel', 'gradual', 'slide', 'downward', 'Gone', 'good', 'natured', 'humor', 'sense', 'place', 'made', 'first', 'few', 'seasons', 'so', 'special', 'Now', ""'re"", 'subjected', 'hour', 'bickering', 'all-too-predictable', 'misunderstandings', 'jealousy', 'top', 'continual', 'romantic', 'musical', 'chairs.Is', 'place', 'world', 'really', 'only', 'unmarried', 'people', 'lookout', 'love', 'EVERYONE', 'series', 'now', 'single', 'most', 'are', 'young', 'trim', 'middle', 'aged', 'heavy', 'set', 'people', 'who', 'serve', 'comic', 'relief', 'buffoons', 'happily', 'married', 'couples', 'children', 'community', 'people', 'sure', 'do', 'get', 'lost', 'loves', 'REAL', 'fast', 'thought', 'Archie', 'was', 'fickle', 'fist', 'Golly', 'deeply', 'dedicated', 'love', 'Molly', 'then', 'two', 'episodes', 'Meg', 'Paul', 'Lex', 'then', 'Isabel', 'then', 'Susan', 'Jess', 'forgets', 'Duncan', 'real', 'fast', 'when', 'someone', 'new', 'appears.Everytime', 'new', 'character', 'introduced', 'can', 'spot', 'immediately', 'he/she', 'will', 'be', 'someone', 'love', 'interest', 'Remember', 'show', 'Hamish', 'MacBeth', 'variety', 'characters', 'was', 'so', 'much', 'more', 'interesting', ""'Also"", 'complete', 'lack', 'logic', 'storylines', 'HUGE', 'estate', 'apparently', 'involved', 'everything', 'raising', 'wolves', 'offering', ""'activity"", 'center', 'almost', 'staff', 'one', 'work', 'Finally', 'show', 'become', 'most', 'part', 'generic', 'locale', 'Gone', 'glimpse', 'Scottish', 'clan', 'life', 'history', 'hardly', 'anyone', 'even', 'kilt', 'anymore', 'Gone', 'are', 'pipes', 'feel', 'country', 'Change', 'names', 'MacDonald', ""O'Reilly"", 'Le', 'Clerc', ""'d"", 'never', 'tell', 'difference.Still', 'show', 'moments', 'continue', 'watch', 'hopes', 'will', 'regain', 'past', 'allure', 'course', 'watch', 'see', 'glorious', 'shots', 'beautiful', 'country', 'listen', 'most', 'marvelous', 'accents']",Monarch of the Glen - Series Six

Well, for me there are not enough cheerful Scots in the present series. At times 'Monarch' could be set in the Lake district! Lloyd Owen is excellent but he is very English both in accent and attitude, fair enough but the surrounding cast are universally mournful and the only one with any flair is Tom Baker, also English! Where is the enjoyable sparring of Hector and Kilwillie, the earthy attraction of Lexy, the sheer unbridled enthusiasm of Duncan? If a series is set in Scotland, particullarly one which plays up the romance of the Highlands, then lets have some tartan happiness and daftness and less English melancholy. The presence of Alexander Morton and Susan Hampshire ensure some continuity but the happy eccentricities of Hector, Duncan and Lexy are sorely missed.

As the series progressed, we grew to love the zany antics of Duncan and Hector, watched Archie come to grips with his family and their situation, and all were very entertaining.  Slowly, each of the principles took their leave, and new characters were introduced to fill the gaps.  The problem with this was that by the time they reached Series Six, there were only a couple of original characters left and the magic was gone.  I knew it was over for me when they showed the phoney glint off Lexie's diamond wedding ring at the end of Series Four, while she was sweetly dancing with Archie.  Then and there the shark was being jumped...too bad.
