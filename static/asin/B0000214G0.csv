512844,ANCOMAI0I7LVG,B0000214G0,Andrew Ellington,"[3, 6]","The biggest problem with `Ghosts of Mississippi' is that it is bland.  The story is not technically a bland one, I mean it is a true story of the murder of a civil rights activist and the trial that brought a terrible man to justice, but the way Reiner goes about delivering this story is anything but exciting.  The acting is decent, and at times engaging, but for the most part they are merely passable and do nothing for the film in general.I really wanted to like this movie.The film opens with the devastating murder of Medger Evers, a young husband and father of three who was a civil rights leader in Mississippi.  In 1963 his life was snuffed out by outraged racist Byron De La Beckwith.  Due to a racist judge and a racists jury Byron was found `not guilty'  Medger's widow Myrlie tried for thirty years to get justice for her husband but to no avail; and then Bobby DeLaughter walked into her life, or should I say that she walked into his.  Moved by her story, and the similarities to his own life (he is also a husband in his thirties and father of three), DeLaughter works around the clock to reopen the case, sacrificing his own marriage and his own safety to finally do right by this scorned and broken woman.Sounds like a real attention grabber, doesn't it.Sadly, it's not.One issue I have with the film is the acting.  Baldwin, Goldberg, Woods; they are all capable actors but none of them really rise to the occasion as far as I am concerned.  Baldwin probably does the best job, and that's mostly because he has far more screen time and so he has more opportunity to make up for his overall blandness.  Woods is just plain hammy at best.  He succeeds in creating a creep, but he comes of as no more than a gimmick.  I was really disappointed with Goldberg, who has delivered so often in the past.  She was just way too reserved here, too conservative.  I felt no real emotion come from her.  It all just felt like an overly rehearsed line reading.  The direction doesn't help the film any either.  Reiner builds no tension within the film and so it just tends to drag on.  There is no excitement, no reason for us to pay attention because it feels like nothing is happening.There is a scene where DeLaughter rushes his family outside because he fears there is a bomb in his house.  This is supposed to be tense.  It is not.  Watch `The Insider' and notice how Michael Mann builds so much tension with a similar `rush out of the house' type scene.There are many films that deal with this type of subject; in fact I've seen quite a few of them the past week.  This is one of the worst.  Watch the glorious `Mississippi Burning' or even `A Time to Kill', which was released the very same year.  Both films are much more respectable and much more engaging than this wasted opportunity.  It's sad, because this is as important story that deserved a better storyteller.",2,Falls flat of its initial promise...,1224547200,"10 21, 2008",2008,2882,"['biggest', 'problem', 'Ghosts', 'Mississippi', 'bland', 'story', 'not', 'technically', 'bland', 'one', 'mean', 'true', 'story', 'murder', 'civil', 'rights', 'activist', 'trial', 'brought', 'terrible', 'man', 'justice', 'way', 'Reiner', 'delivering', 'story', 'anything', 'exciting', 'acting', 'decent', 'times', 'engaging', 'most', 'part', 'are', 'merely', 'passable', 'do', 'nothing', 'film', 'general.I', 'really', 'wanted', 'like', 'movie.The', 'film', 'devastating', 'murder', 'Medger', 'Evers', 'young', 'husband', 'father', 'three', 'who', 'was', 'civil', 'rights', 'leader', 'Mississippi', '1963', 'life', 'was', 'snuffed', 'out', 'outraged', 'racist', 'Byron', 'De', 'La', 'Beckwith', 'Due', 'racist', 'judge', 'racists', 'jury', 'Byron', 'was', 'found', 'not', 'guilty', 'Medger', 'widow', 'Myrlie', 'tried', 'thirty', 'years', 'get', 'justice', 'husband', 'avail', 'then', 'Bobby', 'DeLaughter', 'walked', 'life', 'should', 'say', 'walked', 'Moved', 'story', 'similarities', 'own', 'life', 'also', 'husband', 'thirties', 'father', 'three', 'DeLaughter', 'clock', 'reopen', 'case', 'sacrificing', 'own', 'marriage', 'own', 'safety', 'finally', 'do', 'right', 'scorned', 'broken', 'woman.Sounds', 'real', 'attention', 'grabber', ""n't"", 'it.Sadly', 'not.One', 'issue', 'have', 'film', 'acting', 'Baldwin', 'Goldberg', 'Woods', 'are', 'capable', 'actors', 'none', 'really', 'rise', 'occasion', 'as', 'far', 'am', 'concerned', 'Baldwin', 'probably', 'best', 'job', 'mostly', 'far', 'more', 'screen', 'time', 'so', 'more', 'opportunity', 'make', 'up', 'overall', 'blandness', 'Woods', 'just', 'plain', 'hammy', 'best', 'creating', 'creep', 'more', 'gimmick', 'was', 'really', 'disappointed', 'Goldberg', 'who', 'delivered', 'so', 'often', 'past', 'was', 'just', 'way', 'too', 'reserved', 'here', 'too', 'conservative', 'felt', 'real', 'emotion', 'come', 'just', 'felt', 'overly', 'rehearsed', 'line', 'reading', 'direction', ""n't"", 'help', 'film', 'Reiner', 'tension', 'film', 'just', 'drag', 'excitement', 'reason', 'pay', 'attention', 'nothing', 'happening.There', 'scene', 'where', 'DeLaughter', 'family', 'bomb', 'house', 'supposed', 'be', 'tense', 'not', 'Watch', 'Insider', 'notice', 'how', 'Michael', 'Mann', 'so', 'much', 'tension', 'similar', 'rush', 'house', 'type', 'are', 'many', 'films', 'deal', 'type', 'subject', 'fact', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'quite', 'few', 'past', 'week', 'one', 'worst', 'Watch', 'glorious', 'Mississippi', 'Burning', 'even', 'Time', 'Kill', ""'"", 'was', 'released', 'very', 'same', 'year', 'films', 'are', 'much', 'more', 'respectable', 'much', 'more', 'engaging', 'wasted', 'opportunity', 'sad', 'as', 'important', 'story', 'deserved', 'better', 'storyteller']",N/A

I also love courtroom dramas, which makes up the last quarter or so of this movie. And stories of the civil rights movement of the 1960s have recently gained my interest, as I come to realize how little filtered through to me at the time. For example, did you know that Medgar Evers was gunned down on the very day that President Kennedy made a major speech on civil rights? I hadn't. Nor had I known that Evers' killer, Byron ""Delay"" Beckwith (James Woods), was tried twice to hung juries. In the 1960s, white men simply were not found guilty of murder for killing black men. Disgusting, but true.But Merlie Evers, Medgar's widow (played to perfection by Whoopi Goldberg) never forgot, and never gave up. Finally, in 1989, Mrs. Evers found a champion in assistant district attorney Bobby DeLaughter (Alec Baldwin), who risks his marriage and his career to reconstruct the evidence and bring Beckwith to trial once more.Wait until you see where the murder weapon is eventually found.There are many small touches that turn this from a history story to a modern (well, OK; relatively modern) look at the realities of American life. Yes, Mississippi has changed. But as we all know by now, racism is not really dead, not even the casual racism that expects agreement from any white person in the room. And it's not just the beer-swilling Good Old Boys, either. The country club crowd show up pretty ugly in their veneer of respectability.This movie had me involved with every minute.

MacNeil ""Chris M""","[4, 6]","Even before there was a name for the civil rights movement of the 1960's, there was Medgar Evers, perhaps the first casualty of the movement. June 12, 1963, the very night that President John Kennedy made his landmark speech to the nation about equality of the races and his administration's pledge to the basic rights of all people, Evers took a mortal hit in his back outside his home in Jackson, Miss., from a bullet fired out of racism and powered by hate. Nearly 30 years later, after two mistrials with hung juries, Evers' suspected killer, avowed bigot and hate-mongerer Byron de la Beckwith, faces his third trial set up by an idealistic prosecutor, acted with restrained emotionality but an unshakeable sense of justice by Alec Baldwin. As Evers' widow, Whoppi Goldberg brings a sense of majestic class to the lady who never gave up in her own quest for justice. And James Woods is nothing less than superlative in his portrayal of the accused, and Woods holds nothing back in projecting the cockiness, the poisonous racism and lethal hatred the real character apparently carried for most of his life. Director Rob Reiner treats us here to a lesson in history that perhaps has not given Evers his just due as a pioneer in the march for civil rights, and Reiner treats this very serious topic with respect, dignity, sincerity and commitment. In real life, Beckwith died in prison and with him hopefully went one more voice for hate and division. But, because it took nearly three decades to bring Beckwith to justice, ""Ghosts of Mississippi"" asks the subtle question if justice delay isn't also justice denied.

The story is told of the tragic death of Medgar Evars (a civil rights activist) who was viciously gunned down by Byron De La Beckwith (a white supremacist). The film is brilliantly told by famed director Rob Reiner. The chilling and haunting performance of De La Beckwith by James Woods is worth the price of admission alone!This film should be seen by all Americans as it is a tragic story with a just and happy ending.All right lets get to the film. The film moves very quickly as you barely get a chance to take a breath. The film may even move a bit too fast but that can be overlooked. The acting was well done by lead actors Alec Baldwin and Whoopi Goldberg and had strong supporting acting from Craig T. Nelson and William H. Macy. But as I mentioned before James Woods stole the show with his absolutely BRILLIANT performance as De La Beckwith. Woods was nominated for an Oscar and was robbed when he did not win. It is to be noted that James Woods was repulsed by the real Beckwith which made his performance all the more powerful.The film was shot on location in Jackson, Mississippi and followed the real events pretty closely. The showdown in the bathroom between Baldwin (Delauter) and Woods (De La Beckwith) was chilling and the best part of the film.

All the supporting actors and actresses are believable and do a great job as well.

When Evers' widow Whoopi Goldberg approaches the District Attorney's office about re-opening the case of her late husband's murder, Baldwin takes an interest as he considers the injustice and the suffering of the Evers' family.  The first two trials, 25 years earlier, were declared mistrials, and the hunt begins for new evidence that might make a re-trial a viable option.  Needless to say, much stands in the way for Baldwin, both professionally and personally as he takes an unpopular stand in a still racially divided Mississippi.  Baldwin, a good actor that has appeared in too few good films, is strong in this role, although he is outshone by James Woods in a flashy performance as Byron de la Beckwith, the accused racist.  Woods has a field day, in heavy makeup and padding, make the most of his moments on screen.  Goldberg is very subdued, and I found her performance adequate, but a bit disappointing.  Actually, the film itself is quite subdued, too.  Director Rob Reiner is sloppy here, not establishing much in the way of pacing or tone, but he is fortunate that the subject of the film and the fact that it is true maintains the viewer's interest despite its shortcomings.  Although I recommend the film, especially to those who enjoy true stories and stories with a courtroom bent, I do wish a better film had been made about this important case in civil rights history.",3,Subdued Treatment of Landmark  Case,1011398400,"01 19, 2002",2002,1508,"['Alec', 'Baldwin', 'lawyer', 'true', 'story', 're-trial', 'murderer', 'civil', 'rights', 'leader', 'Medgar', 'Evers', 'When', 'Evers', 'widow', 'Whoopi', 'Goldberg', 'District', 'Attorney', 'office', 're-opening', 'case', 'late', 'husband', 'murder', 'Baldwin', 'interest', 'injustice', 'suffering', 'Evers', 'family', 'first', 'two', 'trials', '25', 'years', 'earlier', 'were', 'declared', 'mistrials', 'hunt', 'new', 'evidence', 'might', 'make', 're-trial', 'viable', 'option', 'Needless', 'say', 'much', 'stands', 'way', 'Baldwin', 'professionally', 'personally', 'unpopular', 'stand', 'still', 'racially', 'divided', 'Mississippi', 'Baldwin', 'good', 'actor', 'appeared', 'too', 'few', 'good', 'films', 'strong', 'role', 'outshone', 'James', 'Woods', 'flashy', 'performance', 'Byron', 'la', 'Beckwith', 'accused', 'racist', 'Woods', 'field', 'day', 'heavy', 'makeup', 'padding', 'make', 'most', 'moments', 'screen', 'Goldberg', 'very', 'subdued', 'found', 'performance', 'adequate', 'bit', 'disappointing', 'Actually', 'film', 'quite', 'subdued', 'too', 'Director', 'Rob', 'Reiner', 'sloppy', 'here', 'not', 'establishing', 'much', 'way', 'pacing', 'tone', 'fortunate', 'subject', 'film', 'fact', 'true', 'viewer', 'interest', 'shortcomings', 'recommend', 'film', 'especially', 'who', 'enjoy', 'true', 'stories', 'stories', 'courtroom', 'bent', 'do', 'wish', 'better', 'film', 'had', 'been', 'made', 'important', 'case', 'civil', 'rights', 'history']",N/A

He was tried twice before but both times the case ended in hung juries.  It is also a portrait of enduring patience in the fact that his widow, Myrlie Evers, had to wait 30 years for final justice, all the while knowing that her husband`s assassin remained a free man.I can't honestly think of too many movies where I have seen Alec Baldwin and Whoopi Goldberg give such impressive acting performances as compared to their work here.  They both fit their roles perfectly and it shows.  On the other end of the spectrum, James Woods, who also did an outstanding job, is so into his character that it is almost spooky.  The way he behaves and delivers his lines just gives the impression that you're looking at total hate and evil personified in a man.To compliment the acting, the movie moves along at a nice pace and portrays the difficulties of preparing a case that is 3 decades old along with the still unresolved issues of racism still evident in the Mississippi climate.  As for the trial itself, this is also a tense atmosphere that adds realism and intrigue to the movie.  If I had to make a comparison, and this being based on similar types of events, I would have to say that this film ranks up there with `Mississippi Burning' which is also an excellent movie in its own right.`Ghosts of Mississippi' is a fine example of solid acting and directing coupled with a strong, thought provoking story.

These characters and the actors and actress that portray them absolutely make this film as heart-throbbing, stunning, and cold as John Grisham's novel-based Movie, ""Time To Kill"". When a colored radical for the civil rights movement is shot, and the leading trial is dismissed, his wife, portrayed by Whoopi, goes to Alec Baldwin, seeking justice for the mistrial 25 years later. With little to no evidence and half of the witnesses gone, it seems like a lose-lose battle for justice. However, Alec Baldwin's character is sympathetic.Alec Baldwin's performance is one of many that really stand out and make the film worth listening to when the trials are progressed. Matching Matthew's Jake Brigance in Time To Kill, he is just as passionate as a prosecuting attorney can be. With James Woods' character, Byron 'De La', challenging the witnesses and everyone else against him with careless expressions and cold-hearted comments, the movie makes for an epidemic.James Woods stars as the killer--no spoiler since the viewer sees it. Byron is as guilty as the justice system can punish him. He is definitely the worst person in the movie, the racist who even ADMITS it several times that he's guilty as charged. Convinced that he's going to go free as he did two trials 25 years ago, his ego is annoying down to the very last comments.This movie is spectacular, written quick and easy but bares still the intellectual intent that is the trials, civil rights, and the justice needed to be handed.

Alec Baldwin/Bobby DeLaughter, did come from a racist family, the difference is, he overcame it. I saw this movie on TNT for the first time, and wanted to see the unedited version. Strangely enough, not too much was taken out. Within the next few years, it became part of my movie library. Whoppi Goldberg and Alec Baldwin were both excellent in this film, what amazes me though, is this film has not gotten the credit it clearly deserves. Even James Woods did his homework, as Beckwith, without meeting the real man: you despised him in this film anyway. I know James Woods frequently plays a villian, but in this film, he nails it! Now, Alec and Whoppi have some of the best lines, and every line by Alec in the final trial is given with alot of heart. The script even manages to throw in some unexpected humor, from time to time. I didn't know about the Medger Evers case at all, before seeing this film, and for that alone, I commend Rob Riener and the script.

512881,A1XZJ32DJS8YV2,B0000214G0,"R. M. Williams ""just an avid reader""","[2, 14]","How many times have i heard the aphorism that justice is just us, meaning that justice is for the 'in group'. I had a lawyer, an expensive and successful lawyer tell me that juries were crapshoots and that since i was offered an alternative i ought to take it, even though i wanted to defend myself. For we all have the righteous indignation at justice denied.This innate sense of justice is something we all seem to have, from the time our brothers get a little bit more than half of the candy bar, to the time we missed a B by just 1 point. When it comes to us, to our welfare, we have this developed sense of outrage, the sense of being unjustly accused.But this childish sense of fairness, of dividing candy bars and slices of pie, of getting our fair share of whatever, is where most of our senses of justice stay, never growing, never really maturing to a stage of real justice, just kindof stunted. But it is a useful start and our jury system deeply relies on it and average common sense, despite the complexity and increasing technicality of the law and evidence. It is this innate sense of human justice that the movie builds on, and from what the authors desired for us to grow out of, to a more mature form.His wife desired justice for him and his lost life, for his dreams that caused the bullet to fly, for the years his children lost their father and her his love.Lots of people, not just the racist rightwing, but average, workaday people just want the evil of past days to go away, to get on with the rebuilding of a New South.But a few, pitifully few, like the Asst. DA understand the higher definition of justice as more than a fair division of the spoils, a candy bar cut by one person and first choice to the other, more than material fairness. More than the personal, more than the selfish, more than the selfcentered me. The ADA grows into the role, he starts with a strong self identificationwith the victim, add to it the sense of the law developed as a lawyer and a good prosecutor. But something changed in the research, something was added to the mix, the racist murderer not just laughed at the law, not just flouted justice but he came to symbolize all the evil of the past that continued as remnants in the present. But he began to realize that ghosts need to be sung to sleep, and not just with the hymns to which armies marched, but with real songs of justice.The Rwandan genocide trials, the South African committee on truth and reconciliation, the Serbian wartrials in the Hague. Why?retribution? expiation of guilt? scapegoating? fixing the blame to absolve those who continue to do such things?Justice needs a voice, the truth like debrising a wound hurts, but it cleanses. Why is this?guilt, repentance, justice, payment, retribution, forgiveness. these are all loaded religious terms. but they are also terms for our social and legal system to use to right wrongs, exact punishment, and to set the record straight. The big reason is that if we can not trust the past to have been relatively just than we have no hope that if we are dragged to the bar that justice will be done then either.This is the theme of the movie, the past failed many black victims of hate, of lynchings, of violence. Their names will never make it into books or movies, but a few, as examples of contrition, examples of a changing socio-political climate, examples of changing hearts, their names make it into our collective consciousnesses. These lend support to the hope that there is progress in racial relationships in this country, that the past can be with its ghosts- sung to sleep so that we can sleep at night without the Klan burning crosses down the block. Without police officers abusing their authority to murder, to profile -- driving while black, without the judges dealing out injustice and evil.And that is the value of watching the movie. and the hope that justice left undone in this world will be rightfully applied in the next. which ought to leave us all a little concerned, for often we grabbed that larger piece, and not just as kids.",4,singing to the ghosts,1116460800,"05 19, 2005",2005,4072,"['How', 'many', 'times', 'have', 'i', 'heard', 'aphorism', 'justice', 'just', 'meaning', 'justice', ""'in"", 'group', 'had', 'lawyer', 'expensive', 'successful', 'lawyer', 'tell', 'juries', 'were', 'crapshoots', 'i', 'was', 'offered', 'alternative', 'i', 'ought', 'take', 'even', 'i', 'wanted', 'defend', 'have', 'righteous', 'indignation', 'justice', 'denied.This', 'innate', 'sense', 'justice', 'something', 'seem', 'have', 'time', 'brothers', 'get', 'little', 'bit', 'more', 'half', 'candy', 'bar', 'time', 'missed', 'B', 'just', '1', 'point', 'When', 'welfare', 'have', 'developed', 'sense', 'outrage', 'sense', 'being', 'unjustly', 'childish', 'sense', 'fairness', 'dividing', 'candy', 'bars', 'slices', 'pie', 'getting', 'fair', 'share', 'whatever', 'where', 'most', 'senses', 'justice', 'stay', 'never', 'growing', 'never', 'really', 'maturing', 'stage', 'real', 'justice', 'just', 'kindof', 'stunted', 'useful', 'start', 'jury', 'system', 'deeply', 'relies', 'average', 'common', 'sense', 'complexity', 'increasing', 'technicality', 'law', 'evidence', 'innate', 'sense', 'human', 'justice', 'movie', 'what', 'authors', 'desired', 'grow', 'more', 'mature', 'form.His', 'wife', 'desired', 'justice', 'lost', 'life', 'dreams', 'caused', 'bullet', 'fly', 'years', 'children', 'lost', 'father', 'love.Lots', 'people', 'not', 'just', 'racist', 'rightwing', 'average', 'workaday', 'people', 'just', 'want', 'evil', 'past', 'days', 'go', 'away', 'get', 'rebuilding', 'New', 'South.But', 'few', 'pitifully', 'few', 'Asst', 'DA', 'understand', 'higher', 'definition', 'justice', 'more', 'fair', 'division', 'spoils', 'candy', 'bar', 'cut', 'one', 'person', 'first', 'choice', 'other', 'more', 'material', 'fairness', 'More', 'personal', 'more', 'selfish', 'more', 'selfcentered', 'ADA', 'role', 'strong', 'self', 'victim', 'add', 'sense', 'law', 'developed', 'lawyer', 'good', 'prosecutor', 'something', 'changed', 'research', 'something', 'was', 'added', 'mix', 'racist', 'murderer', 'not', 'just', 'laughed', 'law', 'not', 'just', 'flouted', 'justice', 'came', 'symbolize', 'evil', 'past', 'continued', 'remnants', 'present', 'began', 'realize', 'ghosts', 'need', 'be', 'sung', 'sleep', 'not', 'just', 'hymns', 'armies', 'marched', 'real', 'songs', 'justice.The', 'Rwandan', 'genocide', 'trials', 'South', 'African', 'committee', 'truth', 'reconciliation', 'Serbian', 'wartrials', 'Hague', 'Why', 'retribution', 'expiation', 'guilt', 'scapegoating', 'fixing', 'blame', 'absolve', 'who', 'continue', 'do', 'such', 'things', 'Justice', 'voice', 'truth', 'debrising', 'wound', 'Why', 'guilt', 'repentance', 'justice', 'payment', 'retribution', 'forgiveness', 'are', 'loaded', 'religious', 'terms', 'are', 'also', 'terms', 'social', 'legal', 'system', 'use', 'right', 'wrongs', 'exact', 'punishment', 'set', 'record', 'straight', 'big', 'reason', 'can', 'not', 'trust', 'past', 'have', 'been', 'relatively', 'just', 'have', 'hope', 'are', 'dragged', 'bar', 'justice', 'will', 'be', 'done', 'then', 'either.This', 'theme', 'movie', 'past', 'failed', 'many', 'black', 'victims', 'hate', 'lynchings', 'violence', 'names', 'will', 'never', 'make', 'books', 'movies', 'few', 'examples', 'contrition', 'examples', 'changing', 'socio-political', 'climate', 'examples', 'changing', 'hearts', 'names', 'make', 'collective', 'consciousnesses', 'lend', 'support', 'hope', 'progress', 'racial', 'relationships', 'country', 'past', 'can', 'be', 'ghosts-', 'sung', 'sleep', 'so', 'can', 'sleep', 'night', 'Klan', 'burning', 'crosses', 'down', 'block', 'police', 'officers', 'abusing', 'authority', 'murder', 'profile', 'driving', 'black', 'judges', 'dealing', 'out', 'injustice', 'evil.And', 'value', 'watching', 'movie', 'hope', 'justice', 'left', 'undone', 'world', 'will', 'be', 'rightfully', 'applied', 'next', 'ought', 'leave', 'little', 'concerned', 'often', 'grabbed', 'larger', 'piece', 'not', 'just', 'kids']",N/A

Though as I remember it, we were not taught much about him during Black History Month.I remember reading how he encouraged a reporter doing a story on him to focus on the Emmet Till story, because it was an example of the type of justice Black people received in Mississippi.  So he was instrumental helping to shine a national spotlight on racism and the resulting violence against Black people including lynching.  He also went undercover posing as a field worker to find witnesses to Emmet Till's murder who were afraid to go to Mississippi police officers because they feared for their lives.His murder cut short his important work as civil rights leader at a time when he was needed most.  The movie centers on the journey of his widow to gain justice for him, 30 years after his murder by Byron De La Beckwith.  De La Beckwith was played chillingly by James Woods who gave an oscar worthy performance.The movie from all the news accounts I read while following the case sticks close to what really happened.  The performances were excellent especially Whoppi Goldberg and Alex Baldwin.Baldwin's character is in some ways a metaphor for mainstream americans who, despite trying, are still unable to grasp that the Civil Rights movement was about much more than being able to eat in a white resturant.I watched this with my mother, on DVD, and when Baldwin's character explains to his children why Evers fought for equality so ""Black people could eat in the same reasturants"" my mother said to the screen- "" We fought to save our children from suffering the unjust fate of Emmet Till.""Baldwin convincingly portrays a person who because of his involvement with this case is forced to confront the overt racism he has always ignored in his family and in himself.Goldberg portrays the manerisms of Myrlie Evers so perfectly, I had an opportunity to attend a speech she gave, and only then could I fully appreciate the subtle nuances of Goldberg's performance, which was also oscar worthy.My only real critique was the casting of Yolanda King as Myrlie Evers' daughter.  You just don't believe that Yolanda King and Whoppi Goldberg are mother and daughter.  Yolanda King looks older than her in every scene.  The director either did not try, or could not compensate using makeup, camera angles or digital effects.I have not seen Yolanda King in anything else but next to Whoppi Goldberg she seems like a bad actress.  It is not too bad for the film because she does not have many scenes.I know from interviews including one he gave with Myrlie Evers on Oprah that for Rob Reiner this film was a labor of love, and this probaly influenced his decision to cast Yolanda King in this part.  Many other young actresses could have done justice to this part and been believeable as Whoppi Goldberg's daughter Kimberly Elise comes to mind.But this one mistake does not take away from the overall amazing quality of this movie - it is a must see.",5,History portrayed responsibly.,1154908800,"08 7, 2006",2006,2998,"['Medgar', 'Evers', 'was', 'key', 'person', 'civil', 'rights', 'movement', 'remember', 'were', 'not', 'taught', 'much', 'Black', 'History', 'Month.I', 'remember', 'reading', 'how', 'encouraged', 'reporter', 'doing', 'story', 'focus', 'Emmet', 'Till', 'story', 'was', 'example', 'type', 'justice', 'Black', 'people', 'received', 'Mississippi', 'was', 'instrumental', 'helping', 'shine', 'national', 'spotlight', 'racism', 'resulting', 'violence', 'Black', 'people', 'including', 'lynching', 'also', 'went', 'undercover', 'posing', 'field', 'worker', 'find', 'witnesses', 'Emmet', 'Till', 'murder', 'who', 'were', 'afraid', 'go', 'Mississippi', 'police', 'officers', 'feared', 'lives.His', 'murder', 'cut', 'short', 'important', 'work', 'civil', 'rights', 'leader', 'time', 'when', 'was', 'needed', 'most', 'movie', 'centers', 'journey', 'widow', 'gain', 'justice', '30', 'years', 'murder', 'Byron', 'De', 'La', 'Beckwith', 'De', 'La', 'Beckwith', 'was', 'played', 'chillingly', 'James', 'Woods', 'who', 'gave', 'oscar', 'worthy', 'performance.The', 'movie', 'news', 'accounts', 'read', 'following', 'case', 'close', 'what', 'really', 'happened', 'performances', 'were', 'excellent', 'especially', 'Whoppi', 'Goldberg', 'Alex', 'Baldwin.Baldwin', 'character', 'ways', 'metaphor', 'mainstream', 'americans', 'who', 'trying', 'are', 'still', 'unable', 'grasp', 'Civil', 'Rights', 'movement', 'was', 'about', 'much', 'more', 'being', 'able', 'eat', 'white', 'resturant.I', 'watched', 'mother', 'DVD', 'when', 'Baldwin', 'character', 'children', 'why', 'Evers', 'fought', 'equality', 'so', 'Black', 'people', 'could', 'eat', 'same', 'reasturants', 'mother', 'said', 'screen-', 'fought', 'save', 'children', 'suffering', 'unjust', 'fate', 'Emmet', 'Till', 'Baldwin', 'convincingly', 'person', 'who', 'involvement', 'case', 'forced', 'confront', 'overt', 'racism', 'always', 'ignored', 'family', 'himself.Goldberg', 'manerisms', 'Myrlie', 'Evers', 'so', 'perfectly', 'had', 'opportunity', 'attend', 'speech', 'gave', 'only', 'then', 'could', 'fully', 'appreciate', 'subtle', 'nuances', 'Goldberg', 'performance', 'was', 'also', 'oscar', 'only', 'real', 'critique', 'was', 'casting', 'Yolanda', 'King', 'Myrlie', 'Evers', 'daughter', 'just', 'do', ""n't"", 'believe', 'Yolanda', 'King', 'Whoppi', 'Goldberg', 'are', 'mother', 'daughter', 'Yolanda', 'King', 'older', 'scene', 'director', 'did', 'not', 'try', 'could', 'not', 'compensate', 'using', 'makeup', 'camera', 'angles', 'digital', 'effects.I', 'have', 'not', 'seen', 'Yolanda', 'King', 'anything', 'else', 'next', 'Whoppi', 'Goldberg', 'bad', 'actress', 'not', 'too', 'bad', 'film', 'not', 'have', 'many', 'scenes.I', 'know', 'interviews', 'including', 'one', 'gave', 'Myrlie', 'Evers', 'Oprah', 'Rob', 'Reiner', 'film', 'was', 'labor', 'love', 'probaly', 'influenced', 'decision', 'cast', 'Yolanda', 'King', 'part', 'Many', 'other', 'young', 'actresses', 'could', 'have', 'done', 'justice', 'part', 'been', 'believeable', 'Whoppi', 'Goldberg', 'daughter', 'Kimberly', 'Elise', 'mind.But', 'one', 'mistake', 'not', 'take', 'away', 'overall', 'amazing', 'quality', 'movie', 'must', 'see']",N/A

512888,A2ZMWGU610X3ZT,B0000214G0,Solipso,"[3, 4]","Years ago I saw the VHS edition of Ghosts of Mississippi on a library shelf. I was in the mood for a good Peter Straub ghost story; so I checked it out. It was not a ghost story, but I was far from disappointed. No ghost story has ever been as good as this story of fact.Most movies are not worth the time necessary to see them. Nevertheless I have seen hundreds of them, and Ghosts of Mississippi is one of my favorites. A recent viewing of the DVD motivated me to buy Of Long Memory, the book that the movie is based on. Almost finished with the book, I checked amazon, thinking of buying the movie for another viewing. Before buying it, I looked at the reviews. I think my reading of the book has given me something to contribute.Ghosts of Mississippi is far better than the older, sensationalistic Mississippi Burning, though the latter got six Oscar nominations. Ghosts of Mississippi got only two: one for James Woods' portrayal of the villain Beckwith, and one for makeup (probably for the makeup on Woods).How can the relatively humble and unacclaimed Ghosts of Mississippi possibly be one of my favorite movies? Am I crazy? Yes, of course I am, but besides that you might want to consider some other things: I have an affection for the acting of Alec Baldwin, Whoopi Goldberg, and James Woods; I favor true crime and courtroom dramas; I have always been a firm advocate of racial equality and civil rights; I appreciate a movie with a hearty stand-up-and-cheer ending.About the acting:1. Of Long Memory says a good deal about that despicable rat Beckwith, and it is always reminiscent of the portrayal by Woods. That indicates Woods did a good job. And he did get an Oscar nomination.2. The book doesn't say a whole lot about Myrlie Evers (the victim's wife), and I wouldn't be surprised to learn that Whoopi's portrayal exhibited more energy than was in the real person. Even so, Whoopi was charismatic, lots of fun, and more than satisfactory.3. Baldwin didn't look at all like the real prosecuting attorney, Bobby DeLaughter. But maybe his acting was accurate. The book says this: ""The critics were discouraging [of DeLaughter's efforts to resurrect a twenty-five year old case]. But.... He would explain in his methodical, plodding way, why he felt impelled to go through with it."" In other words, Oscars are often won not because of the acting but because of the role. Woods had good material to work with. Baldwin's character was methodical and plodding.On unusual occasions, fact is more fictional than fiction. In Ghosts of Mississippi, you'll learn that the murder weapon has disappeared over the years. This was the scoped rifle that Beckwith used. It was an important piece of evidence. You'll also learn, if you pay close attention, that DeLaughter's wife, Dixie, was the daughter of a pro-segregationist judge. After starting on the Evers case, DeLaughter remembered that the judge had a souvenir gun from the the historical Civil Rights era. The gun turned out to be the rifle that was missing. (The serial number matched.) That's right. After a quarter of a century had passed, the young prosecuting attorney for the retrial had married the daughter of the judge who had the missing rifle. Fantastically unlikely, but absolutely true. (I think the movie has the rifle being found in an old chest. The book says it was in a closet.)An interesting point for you Mississippi Burning fans: Two prominent events led to Beckwith's retrial. The immediate stimulus was a court order that released secret Mississippi-government documents suggesting jury tampering in the previous Beckwith trial. But before that, Mississippi Burning itself played a role.Mississippi whites had bad things to say about Mississippi Burning, and so did Mississippi blacks. The latter felt that the movie didn't give enough credit to blacks for the liberal revolution that occurred in the state. I think the blacks were right, but what the movie did successfully was to remind white Mississippians of their uncivil past. Maybe only a few white Mississippians were ashamed of their past, but the movie encouraged at least some members of the new generation to show the world that Mississippi was, if not yet perfect, cleaner and more civilized. So when the secret files were released, there was enough support for a retrial of Beckwith.Postscript (May 4, 2009): I got my DVD in the mail, and after watching this movie (again), I wanted to make a final comment, with respect to Mr. Baldwin's acting. I think the climax of the movie is his portrayal of Bobby DeLaughter's concluding argument. It was one of the more eloquent speeches I have ever seen or heard, in or out of a movie, real or fictional. It was so good it may me doubt that it was composed by the screenwriter. Maybe these were Bobby DeLaughter's actual words. I don't know. But it was a very fine speech, and you owe it to yourself to see the movie so you can see the speech.Two post-movie notes:1. 1999 - Bobby DeLaughter was appointed to a judgeship.2. January 21, 2001 - Beckwith died during imprisonment.",5,This is NOT a ghost story!,1241136000,"05 1, 2009",2009,5064,"['Years', 'ago', 'saw', 'VHS', 'edition', 'Ghosts', 'Mississippi', 'library',
