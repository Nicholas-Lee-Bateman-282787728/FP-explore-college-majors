The gimmick of using the adults as the ""bad examples"" is quite funny and really hits home for the kids when they see the absurdity of bad behavior in a variety of settings.  I showed this to four tough neighbor kids (all about 12-years old), and they loved it, all wanting their own copies!  The next day, I saw two of them cleaning up a knocked-over trash can... which is a 180-degree change in prior behavior!  Is Mind Your Manners to credit for turning rough kids into little angels?  That's my theory!  Check it out!",5,A must for every parent or grandparent... kids love it!!!,1112227200,"03 31, 2005",2005,613,"['such', 'clever', 'program', 'having', 'insight', 'make', 'learning', 'manners', 'FUN', 'kids', 'gimmick', 'using', 'adults', 'bad', 'examples', 'quite', 'funny', 'really', 'home', 'kids', 'when', 'see', 'absurdity', 'bad', 'behavior', 'variety', 'settings', 'showed', 'four', 'tough', 'neighbor', 'kids', '12-years', 'old', 'loved', 'wanting', 'own', 'copies', 'next', 'day', 'saw', 'two', 'cleaning', 'up', 'knocked-over', 'trash', 'can', '180-degree', 'change', 'prior', 'behavior', 'Mind', 'Manners', 'credit', 'turning', 'rough', 'kids', 'little', 'angels', 'theory', 'Check', 'out']",N/A

It was a bit cheesy in the beginning and throughout certain parts of the DVD but then again...it is made for children ages 5-12. I am planning to show this to my students and teach each segment separately after we talk about it, model it and hopefully instill these good habits in their lives! As a bonus...I had also learned a few etiquette tips myself! It is well worth the few dollars I spent purchasing it from a private seller off Amazon.",5,Fun and Informing,1176768000,"04 17, 2007",2007,581,"['Based', 'cover', 'DVD', 'was', 'reluctant', 'purchase', 'did', 'not', 'know', 'exactly', 'what', 'expect', 'watching', 'first', 'time', 'today', 'was', 'bit', 'cheesy', 'beginning', 'certain', 'parts', 'DVD', 'then', 'again', 'made', 'children', 'ages', '5-12', 'am', 'planning', 'show', 'students', 'teach', 'segment', 'separately', 'talk', 'hopefully', 'instill', 'good', 'habits', 'lives', 'bonus', 'had', 'also', 'learned', 'few', 'etiquette', 'tips', 'well', 'few', 'dollars', 'spent', 'purchasing', 'private', 'seller', 'Amazon']",N/A
