There have been many documenaries on this incredible genius's work and each one seems to go a little further that it's predecessor.This is the best one I've seen to date! It covers all of his works, has on screen interviews with RH and his loyal professional fan base. Why this hasn't been released in the U.S. is a mystery, but I suspect a U.S. release will be coming.Rumors of a Harryhausen Blu Ray box set to be released in 2015, hopefully it will include all of his films, shorts, and all extras and documentaries from previous releases. It should include this one as well. There are some decent extras on this release including extended interviews, and trailers for most of his films, Why Golden Voyage, Eye of the Tiger and Clash of the Titan's were left out is strange? The trailers look quite good I just wish it was complete. This is a no brainer for Harryhausen fans!

1620798,A2IY9M330NKBW6,B00B06GF3Y,Eric Sanberg,"[0, 0]","I came of age on Harryhausen flicks. When I was just a young whipper snapper movies of his like ""The Seventh Voyage of Sinbad"" and Jason and the Argonauts"" were hitting the screen and I was hooked. This documentary helped to fill in the blanks on his career.Here's the scoop. This documentary follows the career of Ray Harryhausen, as the title notes, special effects titan. It shows his early entry into the industry, the highlights in his work and delves into the various techniques he used to achieve his greatest wonders.The format here isn't different than anything you've seen before but the content is so astounding you don't really care. It's great they were able to get Harryhausen himself to speak of his history and talk of how he did what he did. He puts in a lot of small anecdotes to add flavor to everything. They also show various directors and film historians to note both his impact on their work as well as what it meant to the movie-going audiences. They choose some choice clips from his  films and walk you through the process of how they came about. Since he knew what the end result was supposed to look like he was always present on the set to work with the actors on how they needed to play a particular scene. Some of the films' directors didn't much care for that but, as some of those interviewed mentioned, ultimately those films didn't belong to the directors. They belonged to Ray Harryhausen. I didn't realize certain films I'd not seen were his so now I'll need to go back and check them out. Right after I finished this I was compelled to screen ""Jason and the Argonauts"". As much as I enjoyed it, I gained a whole new appreciation for his work.If Ray Harryhausen was any part of your film history, this is a must see.",5,The Man and His Magic,1384732800,"11 18, 2013",2013,1753,"['came', 'age', 'Harryhausen', 'flicks', 'When', 'was', 'just', 'young', 'whipper', 'snapper', 'movies', 'Seventh', 'Voyage', 'Sinbad', 'Jason', 'Argonauts', 'were', 'hitting', 'screen', 'was', 'hooked', 'documentary', 'helped', 'fill', 'blanks', 'career.Here', 'scoop', 'documentary', 'career', 'Ray', 'Harryhausen', 'title', 'notes', 'special', 'effects', 'titan', 'early', 'entry', 'industry', 'highlights', 'work', 'various', 'techniques', 'used', 'achieve', 'greatest', 'wonders.The', 'format', 'here', ""n't"", 'different', 'anything', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'content', 'so', 'astounding', 'do', ""n't"", 'really', 'care', 'great', 'were', 'able', 'get', 'Harryhausen', 'speak', 'history', 'talk', 'how', 'did', 'what', 'did', 'lot', 'small', 'anecdotes', 'add', 'flavor', 'everything', 'also', 'show', 'various', 'directors', 'film', 'historians', 'note', 'impact', 'work', 'as', 'well', 'what', 'meant', 'movie-going', 'audiences', 'choose', 'choice', 'clips', 'films', 'walk', 'process', 'how', 'came', 'about', 'knew', 'what', 'end', 'result', 'was', 'supposed', 'look', 'was', 'always', 'present', 'set', 'work', 'actors', 'how', 'needed', 'play', 'particular', 'scene', 'films', 'directors', 'did', ""n't"", 'much', 'care', 'interviewed', 'mentioned', 'ultimately', 'films', 'did', ""n't"", 'belong', 'directors', 'belonged', 'Ray', 'Harryhausen', 'did', ""n't"", 'realize', 'certain', 'films', ""'d"", 'not', 'seen', 'were', 'so', 'now', ""'ll"", 'need', 'go', 'back', 'check', 'out', 'Right', 'finished', 'was', 'compelled', 'screen', 'Jason', 'Argonauts', 'As', 'much', 'enjoyed', 'gained', 'whole', 'new', 'appreciation', 'work.If', 'Ray', 'Harryhausen', 'was', 'part', 'film', 'history', 'must', 'see']",Ray Harryhausen Special Effects Titan
