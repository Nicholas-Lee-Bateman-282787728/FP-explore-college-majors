The box is incredibly well put together. I love the kitschy feel of it. The entire thing is made to resemble an old 45 record box and inside are all of the season sets in LP boxes. When you open up the boxes, the discs are housed in individual sleeves that resemble the old white record sleeves. There is also an awesome hardback (!) book with cast comments from the main crew and a synopsis of all 200 episodes. You also get a mini replica of the last script with (reprinted) signatures from the crew. When the box is all latched up, it fits quite comfortably on my bookshelf and takes up a lot less room than the individual sets. Plus it just looks totally awesome!

1148502,A2E3F04ZK7FG66,B00152R4IS,calvinnme,"[29, 39]","I am about three years older than the kids portrayed in the series. Born in 1958, I learned to drive during the first gas shortage, and got my first post-college graduation job during the second gas shortage in 1979. The 70's were a truly dreadful time to be young - inflation, competing for after-school minimum-wage jobs with laid-off thirty-somethings, dreadful music, worse clothes.The funny thing is, this series doesn't ignor any of that and still manages to make the 70's look fun, even for those of us old enough to know better. It manages to look the 70's directly in the face - complete with time-authentic clothing - and yet fill the show with the hopefulness of youth and the things that make the high school and college years both the best of times and the worst of times. Then there are the parents. The two young lovers in the show - Eric Forman and Donna Pinciotti - truly have dreadful parents with the best of intentions. Eric's parents, Red and Kitty, are not exactly June and Ward although they are conventional for the decade. They represent what happened when the 60's finally reached the suburbs during the 1970's. Donna's parents are two people who have been waiting for the 1960's to show up their whole lives in order to give their weirdness legitimacy. Eric's friends Fez, Kelso, and Jackie round out the group representing nerdiness, well-meaning incompetence, and snobbiness respectively. Hyde is an unusual teenager for a show about the suburbs, but he largely represents someone who has to play the cards he was dealt even when those cards are dealt by largely absentee and negligent parents. I highly recommend all eight seasons even though season eight does lag a bit due to the absence of Eric.",5,An awful decade to be young ... and the series lets you forget all that,1215907200,"07 13, 2008",2008,1728,"['am', 'three', 'years', 'older', 'kids', 'portrayed', 'series', 'Born', '1958', 'learned', 'drive', 'first', 'gas', 'shortage', 'got', 'first', 'post-college', 'graduation', 'job', 'second', 'gas', 'shortage', '1979', '70', 'were', 'truly', 'dreadful', 'time', 'be', 'young', 'inflation', 'competing', 'after-school', 'minimum-wage', 'jobs', 'laid-off', 'thirty-somethings', 'dreadful', 'music', 'worse', 'clothes.The', 'funny', 'thing', 'series', ""n't"", 'ignor', 'still', 'make', '70', 'look', 'fun', 'even', 'old', 'enough', 'know', 'better', 'look', '70', 'directly', 'face', 'complete', 'time-authentic', 'clothing', 'yet', 'fill', 'show', 'hopefulness', 'youth', 'things', 'make', 'high', 'school', 'college', 'years', 'best', 'times', 'worst', 'times', 'Then', 'are', 'parents', 'two', 'young', 'lovers', 'show', 'Eric', 'Forman', 'Donna', 'Pinciotti', 'truly', 'have', 'dreadful', 'parents', 'best', 'intentions', 'Eric', 'parents', 'Red', 'Kitty', 'are', 'not', 'exactly', 'June', 'Ward', 'are', 'conventional', 'decade', 'represent', 'what', 'happened', 'when', '60', 'finally', 'reached', 'suburbs', '1970', 'Donna', 'parents', 'are', 'two', 'people', 'who', 'have', 'been', 'waiting', '1960', 'show', 'up', 'whole', 'lives', 'order', 'give', 'weirdness', 'legitimacy', 'Eric', 'friends', 'Fez', 'Kelso', 'Jackie', 'round', 'out', 'group', 'representing', 'nerdiness', 'well-meaning', 'incompetence', 'snobbiness', 'respectively', 'Hyde', 'unusual', 'teenager', 'show', 'suburbs', 'largely', 'someone', 'who', 'play', 'cards', 'was', 'dealt', 'even', 'when', 'cards', 'are', 'dealt', 'largely', 'absentee', 'negligent', 'parents', 'highly', 'recommend', 'eight', 'seasons', 'even', 'season', 'eight', 'lag', 'bit', 'due', 'absence', 'Eric']",N/A
1148503,A1ELVOQTTWNLJ1,B00152R4IS,Cameron Johnson,"[3, 7]","The packaging: very nice. It's organized very well, and the box is surprisingly durable. It's also a great space saver, as individual season box sets (1 - 8) would take up substantially more room than this all-in-one box set.My one criticism of the packaging is that, included is the script for the last episode, which is bound with little brass rivets. The rivets unfortunately have a tendency to catch on the lip of the box when removing it or putting it back in. Also, the accompanying episode guide has a brown paper ""cover protector"" (like on high school textbooks) and that cover also has a bad habit of catching on the lip of the box, creating little tears. But these are minor inconveniences, and as long as you remember them, you can remove the items carefully and prevent any damage from being done.I'm giving this 3 stars not because of the actual box set (which I was very impressed with) but because of the show itself. This show was a lot funnier when I was a teenager and I didn't yet understand all of the tired TV tropes that were used on this show - the token stupid foreigner, the token hot girl(s), etc. I loved the detail that was put in the show, especially how the sets were designed, and the guest stars they brought in (which were frequently 70's TV stars) was a great touch. I hate to say this, but it was the characters that spoiled the show for me; or rather, the main characters. Eric was too arrogant and treated everyone around him like some sort of servant; Michael was too stupid and slapstick to be likeable; Fez was less of a character and more just one long, racist joke; Jackie was just as annoying as Eric, but smaller in size; and Donna, like Fez, was less of a character and just one long, sexually-objectifying joke. Hyde was the only bearable character, and that's because he didn't have the requisite unbearably annoying personality ""quirk"" that every other character had. It was the supporting characters - the parents, basically - that were at all sympathetic as characters.So I feel torn on the show, as I love the premise, and I greatly admire the detail that went into the show, but I felt so little empathy for the main characters that it was difficult to really engage with the storylines.",3,Could have been better,1304899200,"05 9, 2011",2011,2239,"['packaging', 'very', 'nice', 'organized', 'very', 'well', 'box', 'surprisingly', 'durable', 'also', 'great', 'space', 'saver', 'individual', 'season', 'box', 'sets', '1', '8', 'would', 'take', 'up', 'substantially', 'more', 'room', 'all-in-one', 'box', 'set.My', 'one', 'criticism', 'packaging', 'included', 'script', 'last', 'episode', 'bound', 'little', 'brass', 'rivets', 'rivets', 'unfortunately', 'have', 'tendency', 'catch', 'lip', 'box', 'when', 'removing', 'putting', 'back', 'Also', 'accompanying', 'episode', 'guide', 'brown', 'paper', 'cover', 'protector', 'high', 'school', 'textbooks', 'cover', 'also', 'bad', 'habit', 'catching', 'lip', 'box', 'creating', 'little', 'tears', 'are', 'minor', 'inconveniences', 'as', 'long', 'remember', 'can', 'remove', 'items', 'carefully', 'prevent', 'damage', 'being', 'done.I', ""'m"", 'giving', '3', 'stars', 'not', 'actual', 'box', 'set', 'was', 'very', 'impressed', 'show', 'show', 'was', 'lot', 'funnier', 'when', 'was', 'teenager', 'did', ""n't"", 'yet', 'understand', 'tired', 'TV', 'tropes', 'were', 'used', 'show', 'token', 'stupid', 'foreigner', 'token', 'hot', 'girl', 's', 'etc', 'loved', 'detail', 'was', 'put', 'show', 'especially', 'how', 'sets', 'were', 'designed', 'guest', 'stars', 'brought', 'were', 'frequently', '70', 'TV', 'stars', 'was', 'great', 'touch', 'hate', 'say', 'was', 'characters', 'spoiled', 'show', 'rather', 'main', 'characters', 'Eric', 'was', 'too', 'arrogant', 'treated', 'everyone', 'sort', 'servant', 'Michael', 'was', 'too', 'stupid', 'slapstick', 'be', 'likeable', 'Fez', 'was', 'less', 'character', 'more', 'just', 'one', 'long', 'racist', 'joke', 'Jackie', 'was', 'just', 'as', 'annoying', 'Eric', 'smaller', 'size', 'Donna', 'Fez', 'was', 'less', 'character', 'just', 'one', 'long', 'sexually-objectifying', 'joke', 'Hyde', 'was', 'only', 'bearable', 'character', 'did', ""n't"", 'have', 'requisite', 'unbearably', 'annoying', 'personality', 'quirk', 'other', 'character', 'had', 'was', 'supporting', 'characters', 'parents', 'basically', 'were', 'sympathetic', 'characters.So', 'feel', 'torn', 'show', 'love', 'premise', 'greatly', 'admire', 'detail', 'went', 'show', 'felt', 'so', 'little', 'empathy', 'main', 'characters', 'was', 'difficult', 'really', 'engage', 'storylines']",N/A

I was born in 1971, but actually ""grew up"" for the most part in the '80's. And I started watching this show in my latter 20's, yet I still connected with the kids of Point Place. I watched the show constantly from season 1 to about season 5 or 6, then getting a new girlfriend, I kind of quit watching and only watched most of the last few seasons after getting this box set. I'm surprised at how good the show is up until Eric and Kelso leave. I'm also surprised at how bad the last season is. And I know this is a sit com and the show never got too emotional or heavy throughout the entire run, but the last episode had the potential to be a real tear-jerker, but ultimately failed because they tried to still inject comedy here and there throughout the last half of the episode. Also, what was that nervous twitch that Fez started to have during the 8th season? That thing he did with his fingers? That 70's Show was in direct competition with Freaks And Geeks, both starting their runs at the same time. I like Freaks And Geeks a lot more, but I don't know why the shows were always compred to one another, they're entirely different shows. It was cool to see various cast members of Freaks And Geeks as guest stars on That 70's Show, though. Even though I didn't care for the last season or how the show ended, I still give this 5 stars because it was downright funny and brilliantly written for 7 seasons. In fact, the only episode I didn't like from the first 7 seasons was the musical episode.",5,That Timeless Show.,1232323200,"01 19, 2009",2009,1609,"[""'m"", 'perfect', 'example', 'how', 'show', 'interesting', 'wide', 'range', 'people', 'regardless', 'age', 'was', 'born', '1971', 'actually', 'grew', 'up', 'most', 'part', ""'80"", 'started', 'watching', 'show', 'latter', '20', 'still', 'connected', 'kids', 'Point', 'Place', 'watched', 'show', 'constantly', 'season', '1', 'season', '5', '6', 'then', 'getting', 'new', 'girlfriend', 'kind', 'quit', 'watching', 'only', 'watched', 'most', 'last', 'few', 'seasons', 'getting', 'box', 'set', ""'m"", 'surprised', 'how', 'good', 'show', 'up', 'Eric', 'Kelso', 'leave', ""'m"", 'also', 'surprised', 'how', 'bad', 'last', 'season', 'know', 'sit', 'com', 'show', 'never', 'got', 'too', 'emotional', 'heavy', 'entire', 'run', 'last', 'episode', 'had', 'potential', 'be', 'real', 'tear-jerker', 'ultimately', 'failed', 'tried', 'still', 'inject', 'comedy', 'here', 'there', 'last', 'half', 'episode', 'Also', 'what', 'was', 'nervous', 'twitch', 'Fez', 'started', 'have', '8th', 'season', 'thing', 'did', 'fingers', '70', 'Show', 'was', 'direct', 'competition', 'Freaks', 'Geeks', 'starting', 'runs', 'same', 'time', 'like', 'Freaks', 'lot', 'more', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'why', 'shows', 'were', 'always', 'compred', 'one', ""'re"", 'entirely', 'different', 'shows', 'was', 'cool', 'see', 'various', 'cast', 'members', 'Freaks', 'Geeks', 'guest', 'stars', '70', 'Show', 'Even', 'did', ""n't"", 'care', 'last', 'season', 'how', 'show', 'ended', 'still', 'give', '5', 'stars', 'was', 'downright', 'funny', 'brilliantly', 'written', '7', 'seasons', 'fact', 'only', 'episode', 'did', ""n't"", 'first', '7', 'seasons', 'was', 'musical', 'episode']",N/A
