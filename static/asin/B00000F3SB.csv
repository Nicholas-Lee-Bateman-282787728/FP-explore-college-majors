In its place is a turgid farce that wallows in its own self-indulgence; gone are the vignettes, ranging from Theatre of the Absurd to the creepy, the dramatic and sometimes downright hilarious that go to make up the original. In their place are a series of sub-plots that do nothing except to serve as a veneer for the padding.This is a real insult to anyone's intelligence. Where did this ant-eater come from? What's with the headless corpse? Is it supposed to be dramatic or funny, spooky, what?A second-rate cast wades through third-rate material simply to get a pay cheque. My heart sank into my boots when I heard about this and my forebodings proved sound. This is horrible and it's sad to think of such rich material being tailored for an American audience. It speaks volumes for the ""American audience."" It will, of course, have its audience who will indoubtedly think it's great but that, I suppose, is only because it has Stephen King's money-grubbing paw prints all over it.It's not at all ""death, where is thy sting?""

498129,A3I3051BZDJWGU,B00000F3SB,Diane C. Howard,"[3, 3]","This is the only King screenplay that I've ever even halfway enjoyed. His scripts usually have less suspense than microwaving a Hot Pocket. I thought this was an exeption, perhaps because it didn't need resolution in two hours, so King could play around.Even so, it has problems that are typically King. Who are the retarded kids? I couldn't understand some of their speech, but the only subtitles were in French. What's the point of the headless man? Why keep repeating sight gags that aren't funny? I understand Antubis as a corruption of Anubis, but what do the ants represent? Why does Blondie talk? So many other unresolved issues.I saw the first several episodes on TV years ago, and rented the last two DVDs this week, so that I could see how it ended. I enjoyed the resolution to the issues, for the most part, but wish someone had explained in more detail some of the quirks of this mini-series.Since he became so famous, editors no longer edit his books, which is too bad, since he's brilliant. He can work a story and turn simple, every-day things into terrifying objets d'art. He needs someone to edit his work, though, because the story gets lost now.Unfortunately he doesn't have the same nightmarish skill when it comes to screenplays. He can't make a script scary. The film Diary of Ellen Rimbauer, for example, was superior to Rose Red, King's script. Rose Red wasn't scary or suspenseful. That's the problem that underlies so many of his scripts, even when they're scripts of his own stories. Not the case here, though. There was curiosity, suspense, a great deal of quirky humor. I enjoyed this romp.I realize it was based on the Danish, which many say was better. Not having seen it, I can say that as a stand-alone American tale, this is a great deal of fun.

498132,A3TVS7UW8A2NXV,B00000F3SB,Garry Messick,"[11, 21]","I like Stephen King, and when I heard he was adapting Lars Von Trier's brilliant Danish TV series, The Kingdom, I thought chances were good that the results would be worthwhile. Talk about misplaced optimism. Let's be frank here: this show blows. WOW does it blow.  Apparently King decided he wanted to out-weird the already damn-weird original, and in a way, he does--not by topping the quality of Von Trier's ideas, but simply in sheer quantity of strange and supernatural elements, and it's WAY too much by half. For instance, in The Kingdom, the ghost of the little girl doesn't appear until the very end of the first episode, if I remember correctly. In Kingdom Hospital, she shows up in the first five minutes... and keeps turning up constantly after that. The essence of the creepiness of ghosts is their elusiveness. If they're always around, day or night, popping up here there and everywhere, they become no more frightening or awe-inspiring than a housecat. Add to that the talking anteater, the dancing headless man, the operating room song-and-dance routines--all of which and more King haphazardly tosses on top of the oddities on display in the original source material--and the whole thing collapses in a huge, gaudy pile of self-conscious weirdness-for-weirdness'-sake. You have to have a real feel for the sort of absurdist humor and borderline surrealism King is attempting here, and he just doesn't have it.It would have helped if the characters were at all engaging, but they aren't. The ones King invented bring nothing to the party, and all the others--every single one of them--come off as pale, one-dimensional imitations of their counterparts in Von Trier's series.Give Kingdom Hospital a miss and check out The Kingdom instead.

498135,A3UDYY6L2NH3JS,B00000F3SB,"Jacques COULARDEAU ""A soul doctor, so to say""","[0, 0]","No one will be surprised by the fact this series counts thirteen episodes. No one will be surprised either that the format is obvious prime time television with the regular and frequent blackout cuts and the slow rhythm. Stephen King is more a producer than the real author. The series is by Lars Von Trier and Stephen King only wrote the teleplay of some episodes. We thus have some renewed elements in the plot and story as compared to standard Stephen King stuff. Stephen King though adds here and there his own style and that is not necessarily good or bad, it is variety. The general landscape of the plot is in three time periods on the same spot of land. In the 1860s it was a textile mill exploiting children in the downstairs section. A sweat shop for sure with 16 hours of work a day and then after the Civil War 12 for children condemned to work in the furnace and dyeing level. The factory was going to bite the dust. So its owner decided to burn it and to burn all the children along with the factory to have no witnesses. This owner had a brother who was using the wounded of the factory as guinea pigs for his anti-pain treatment which was essentially some primitive form of lobotomizing. Then the next period was a first hospital in the 1930s in which a descendent of the previous textile mill owner went on with his experiments on patients this time causing a lot of suffering and many deaths. And finally today Kingdom Hospital. This time we are following the model of normal or standard hospital TV series with all the necessary components: emergencies, ambulances, accidents, surgical operations, stressed personnel, romantic episodes, etc. This series adds several other elements to make it fantastic but in a soft way (though too often grosser than horrifying or terrifying). It adds outside the hospital a street priest and in the late episodes this priest will be crucified on some fence, he will die and then rise again in thyree days, Friday, Saturday and Sunday, with plenty of miracles along the way. That is nothing but a side plot with a lot of Christian chanting and other stuff like that. It adds nothing to the plot of the series itself except of course the equivalent of one full episode spread over two. Inside the hospital the series adds two mentally handicapped people, a manager who is only interested in raising money with sponsored advertising campaigns, a crazy surgeon with a past of malpractice and new cases here that are developed at length, and a psychic old lady who takes us into the world of the dead and ghosts. That's at least the superficial visible world. In this visible world the authors add a lot of humorous elements like a nearly blind security supervisor, a dog scavenging for body parts, a practical joker and his pranks, etc. Then the world of the dead is added with its two layers of descending time and the whole plot is the call of these trapped dead people, and children, for the living to help and liberate them. That will take some divine magic to do. The god will be borrowed from the Egyptians, Anubis, in the form of an anteater called Antubis. He will manage to bring on the scene of the hospital an artist who is necessary to see and solve the old problem. A car accident will suffice. I will not go beyond that as for telling you the plot. Go discover it yourself. Be careful it is slightly long and you can't afford to miss one episode. But I will spill a few more rice on the meaning of this tale. It is both a criticism of the hospital world as greedy, expensive, wasteful, stressed and uncaring, etc, without speaking of malpractice and cover-ups. It is also a vision of the hospital world that contains and welcomes some warm personalities, interesting and humane personalities, even if at times it becomes a clich&eacute;, like the young nurse who swoons as soon as she sees blood or something bizarre. It shows how mentally handicapped people can be seers and how extra-sensorial perception is needed to counter-balance the world's insanity with some psychic and mental sanity, even maybe religious spirituality. It shows how artists can also be useful in extreme situations because what they create is as solid as the real world. But the end shows there is some justice somewhere in this world, and that is not King-like. The bad doctor is still there at the end with the Paul ghost but we know he has already been medically suspended and that the malpractice suit will bring him down. Hence there can be some rosy hope and future in this world. Too optimistic for a standard objective mind that righteously considers there is no justice down here, since at the best justice can only exist up there, but necessarily optimistic for prime time television.Dr Jacques COULARDEAU, University Paris Dauphine, University Paris 1 Pantheon Sorbonne & University Versailles Saint Quentin en Yvelines",4,"Too slow, too gross, not terrifying

A haunted hospital.  Surely SOMETHING will happen soon!  I sat waiting for that moment each week.  Week in and week out I was disappointed.  Okay, someTHING happened every episode.  Out of about forty-five minutes (after commercials) only somewhere between 5-10 minutes were used for the actual ghost storylines.  Otherwise we get to see the lives of the doctors.  It tried so hard to be E.R. but it wasn't even close.Why?  Because 95% of the episodes were stupid crap.  Why is the guy on the table sitting up?  Better question, why is it singing?  Even BETTER question, why are the doctors joining in?  The best question, why do I care?  Answer:  I don't!  In one episode there is a headless corpse taking a shower the entire time.  Oooo.  Spooky.  You'll notice that didn't gain any exclamation points from me.Mr. King you promised us a show about ghosts.  You failed.

498138,A3MPRLOQP8D3DL,B00000F3SB,"Jason Peikoff ""JJ""","[25, 28]","It is true, this is one of the most chilling miniseries ever put together by Stephen King himself.  Parts of it are actually based upon his personal experiences after being hit by a driver in Maine.  While it was being aired on television it was a little touch and go there for a while, since the evil network was putting off the subsequent episodes for the longest time.  Luckily they finished the series and I must say, this was definitely something I looked forward to watching week in and out.  Thus, it would be something worth watching over and over again on DVD, so I highly recommend that you buy it if you enjoy the creative genious and irony of Stephen King.  Yes, this series is very ironic and full of odd twists, but that all adds to the mystique.  This DVD is one for the ages, and one that will not truly be appreciated for a year or two to come, because it is such a modern piece of artwork.  If you watch all of the episodes in order on this DVD then you will understand how great Kingdom Hospital really is.  I knew of a few people who missed several episodes while it was on television, and therefore justice just was not done in their eyes, but that was their fault!  The unifying theme is the hospital itself, the people contained in it, and the tragic events they all must grapple with and live through.  Dr. Hook was perhaps the funniest and best character in the entire series, a true man's man in every sense of the word.  Dr. Stegman also made the series very interesting and humorous at times, although you always wanted to just see the old coot get his just desserts (which he often did).  Then of course you have the old, sometimes seen as senile, Mrs. Druise.  She definitely made the series what it is and made for a great character analysis.  So in conclusion, I highly recommend this DVD series and think that you will enjoy it extremely if you like the paranormal, horror, irony, and creative genious of Stephen King.

498140,A2A6NH6DPE0VXR,B00000F3SB,"Jim ""Pimmy""","[4, 4]","Kingdom Hospital is E.R meets Scrubs meets a Stephen King story. It has some of the basic hospital drama stuff while having the whackiness of Scrubs on the side. None of the hospital stuff was even an interest to me though. The horror part about the hit and run victim who communicates with a dead girl in the hospital is what holds the series together. When the show trys to be funny it's just not most of the  time. Like when a head is taken from a dead body to be used as a joke. Then the body runs around headless in the deadworld with ""where's my head at playing"" in the background. That was just dumb period.The cast is strong though with good characters and they help keep you interested and forget about the dumb scenes. Andrew McCarthy gives a better performance than he did in either Weekend at Bernie's. He plays Dr. Hook who has a little feud going on with the bad Dr. Stegman (Bruce Davison). Davison is also extremely good as a Doctor who demands respect but gets none. Diane Ladd steals the show though as a women who constantly fakes being sick in-order to stay in the hospital. She wants to communicate with the dead girl there and try to help her. I was disapointed that Evangeline Lilly ""Kate in Lost"" had a lineless small part though. Sure it was nice seeing her nude back with a sexy tattoo on it. But Lost shows that she's not only capable of more but one of the best actresses around.If you stick with the series it gets a lot better at the finale and almost makes you wish they'd make more episodes. It certainly ends with that possible. Still though it's not bad how it ends at all even if there is loose ends. Two episodes that are the strongest is the  finale and the one with a baseball player. He dropped the ball in a big game and now everywhere he goes he gets called butterfingers. Or even gets balls thrown at him. His team has had bad luck since he lost the big game and everyone think they are cursed because of him. So he thinks he can end the bad luck by killing himself but he can't even kill himself right. That's a very good episode and one of the few that won't make you a little confused.",4,Pretty cool but...odd,1125273600,"08 29, 2005",2005,2130,"['Kingdom', 'Hospital', 'E.R', 'meets', 'Scrubs', 'Stephen', 'King', 'story', 'basic', 'hospital', 'drama', 'stuff', 'having', 'whackiness', 'Scrubs', 'side', 'None', 'hospital', 'stuff', 'was', 'even', 'interest', 'horror', 'part', 'hit', 'run', 'victim', 'who', 'dead', 'girl', 'hospital', 'what', 'series', 'together', 'When', 'show', 'trys', 'be', 'funny', 'just', 'not', 'most', 'time', 'when', 'head', 'taken', 'dead', 'body', 'be', 'used', 'joke', 'Then', 'body', 'around', 'headless', 'deadworld', 'where', 'head', 'playing', 'background', 'was', 'just', 'dumb', 'period.The', 'cast', 'strong', 'good', 'characters', 'help', 'keep', 'interested', 'forget', 'dumb', 'scenes', 'Andrew', 'McCarthy', 'better', 'performance', 'did', 'Weekend', 'Bernie', 'Dr.', 'Hook', 'who', 'little', 'feud', 'going', 'bad', 'Dr.', 'Stegman', 'Bruce', 'Davison', 'Davison', 'also', 'extremely', 'good', 'Doctor', 'who', 'respect', 'none', 'Diane', 'Ladd', 'show', 'women', 'who', 'constantly', 'being', 'sick', 'in-order', 'stay', 'hospital', 'communicate', 'dead', 'girl', 'try', 'help', 'was', 'disapointed', 'Evangeline', 'Lilly', 'Kate', 'Lost', 'had', 'lineless', 'small', 'part', 'Sure', 'was', 'nice', 'seeing', 'nude', 'back', 'sexy', 'tattoo', 'Lost', 'not', 'only', 'capable', 'more', 'one', 'best', 'actresses', 'around.If', 'stick', 'series', 'lot', 'better', 'finale', 'almost', 'wish', ""'d"", 'make', 'more', 'episodes', 'certainly', 'possible', 'Still', 'not', 'bad', 'how', 'even', 'loose', 'ends', 'Two', 'episodes', 'are', 'strongest', 'finale', 'one', 'baseball', 'player', 'dropped', 'ball', 'big', 'game', 'now', 'everywhere', 'called', 'butterfingers', 'even', 'balls', 'thrown', 'team', 'had', 'bad', 'luck', 'lost', 'big', 'game', 'everyone', 'think', 'are', 'cursed', 'can', 'end', 'bad', 'luck', 'killing', 'ca', ""n't"", 'even', 'kill', 'right', 'very', 'good', 'episode', 'one', 'few', 'wo', ""n't"", 'make', 'little', 'confused']",N/A

I have been in lots of hospitals mostly as a patient and laughed my way through a great deal of this series. Other parts were so tragic I almost cried. For anyone who still haven't figured it out yet -- hospitals are corporations and in it for the money. Their biggest customers are large corporations and businesses, drug companies and insurance companies and they will do anything to avoid lawsuits and make money. They are also monitored by individuals who check hospitals for high mortality rates.(The angel of death is based on a true story) A lot of doctors also hold stock in companies which are their contributors. Of course the ghosts are patients who died due to malpractice and mistakes and they roam the hospitals in the form of policies and practices which allow the hospitals to cover-up their screw-ups. The hypocrite oath is taken by all employees and Hippocratic oath by the doctors as well. Although I think they sometimes get confused as to which one to follow. No one dares spill the beans if they want to continue employment in a hospital. In addition hospitals are ladened with politics.  The movie series made fun of most of the hilarious capers which fill the nooks and crannies of hospitals which I have personally witnessed.

498153,A92XVSV8LADWZ,B00000F3SB,Otto Yuen,"[11, 12]","""Horror author Stephen King was seriously injured when he was struck by a minivan while walking in North Lovell, Maine, Saturday, Maine State Police said."" from CNN, June 19, 1999.Kingdom Hospital was inspired by Stephen King's accident in 1999. It's not originally authored by King himself but from a Danish mini-series ""The Kingdom"" by Lars von Trier first aired in 1994. It was originally titled ""Riget,"" and is the basis for Kingdom Hospital.I didn't watch the Kingdom Hospital series on TV but I saw the trailer clips from one of my DVD rental couple months ago. Wow, it drew my attentions right away, cooool. I like the King's Rose Red DVD mini series but know nothing about this. Before placing my order, I checked out some reviews about Kingdom Hospital. Some are positive some are negative. Couldn't make up my mind. The DVD's out, I still hesitated my purchase but I finally placed the order because my mind kept telling me to buy, buy, buy. My boxset arrived. I couldn't wait longer, immediately opened the box, and plug into my DVD player.....and I couldn't stop watching.It's not a super horror film with tons of special visual effects, but it gives you a mysterious feeling, and some strange elements are actually attracting you to find out what's going on. At the end, all puzzles are resolved, but a seed for the second season series is also planted. However, up to now, ABC did not renew Kingdom Hospital for a second season and there are no plans at this time to do one with another network.Overall, it's excellent! It comes with good features like ""The Making of Kingdom Hospital"", ""Designing Kingdom Hospital: A Tour"", and ""The Making of Antubis"". As the Antubis in the film said, ""You do me a solid, I do you a solid"". I rate this mini-series FIVE STARS.*** Otto Yuen's DVD Special Rating for Kingdom Hospital ***1.

498156,A1Z1NQJUJQ5CRO,B00000F3SB,Robert Badgley,"[2, 2]","Kingdom Hospital was a 2004 mini series based on the teleplay by Stephen King who also excutive produced this weird but wonderful ride.The series takes its' name from the fictional hospital which it portrays in Lewiston,Maine.The building was erected upon the ground of a mill which burned down(due to arson)in 1869 killing outright most of the child slave labourers but one,Mary Jensen.She escaped briefly only to be caught by the factory owners' sadistic brother and ""medical practitioner"".He used medically unauthorized procedures on most of his patients/victims and poor Mary succumbed as a result.Fast forward in time and we enter the world of Kingdom Hospital with its' eclectic variety of medical and support personnel.The story kicks off with the tragic hit and run of a famous local painter and from what I have read probably a close proximity to Stephen Kings' own terrible ordeal some years ago.He is rendered comatose with multiple internal and external injuries and has virtually no hope of recovery.Soon he begins to experience some strange things and he slowly begins a recovery thought impossible by the admitting physicians.However the restless undead are at work and in a battle on this property and he is the pivotal key in the story.Two figures are important to the painter throughout and that is Mary Jensen herself and her ""companion"" Anubis the mythological Egyptian gatekeeper between our world and the next,who she mistakenly calls Antubis.Antubis closely resembles a giant ant eater,the difference being this one has a long and large mouth with very sharp and powerful teeth.As the story weaves its' way to its' inevitable climax, many characters come in and out of the story and all are in some way directly affected by the strange malevolence that abounds throughout the hospital.Each character has its' own and unique personality which gives this memorable story arc such depth.We have psychic Mrs.Drus(Diane Ladd),Dr.Hook(Andrew McCarthy),Bruce Davison(Dr.Stegman),Head of the Hospital Dr.Jesse James(Ed Begley Jr.) and so many more.There is even a caretaker called Johnny B.Goode which is  a running gag throughout the series.Everytime Dr.Stegman goes to look for him he's always away.Actors like Charles Martin Smith,Dick Smothers and Wayne Newton(!) step in to play the character fill-in for him.When Johnny finally does appear it turns out to be Stephen King himself!I recommend this mini series to everyone.It is chock full of memorable charcaters and situations and never fails to hold your attention.Sometimes you wonder where the story is going but like any story arc one must be patient and your patience is definitely rewarded in  Kingdom Hospital.",4,A weird and wonderful trip!

498161,A1ZZ2EB6FCY8MW,B00000F3SB,"Staci L. Wilson ""Author: Animal Movies Guide ...","[46, 55]","This Stephen King miniseries takes place in a haunted hospital in Maine, which was built on the site of a Civil War-era fire where a score of helpless children perished. It's King, so you can bet the ghosts aren't too happy with their lot in the afterlife. The chilling but comedically off-kilter teleplay (one installment was entitled ""The Young and the Headless"") features a strong ensemble cast and a few searingly memorable talking animal characters. One is a German Shepherd complete with a Teutonic accent named Blondie (voiced by Julian Richings), and another verbose pooch is called Charlie (Ryan Robbins). Most striking of all is an often malevolent but always judicious phantasmagorical anteater (CGI, modeled on a real giant anteater; voiced by Kett Turton) named Antubis. Antubis's long tongue finds ants hiding in some very unexpected places (""Antsolutely delicious!"" he chortles, dipping into an insect-infested human brain). Based on a Danish miniseries called The Kingdom by Lars von Trier.What a difference a DVD makes. Without the concentration-blowing commercial interruptions, and the luxury of being able to watch as much (or as little) of the 13 hour opus as one likes, Kingdom Hospital plays a lot better. That is not to say that it's a perfect miniseries. It's pretty weird, takes some getting into, and it almost lost me a few times with its weirdness. I felt some of the music choices were really inappropriate and rather irritating, and thought one scene of the doctors breaking into a song-and-dance routine was far too ""Cop Rock"". But if you stick with it throughout all it's quirky eccentricity, Kingdom Hospital will reward you with some terrific characters, excellent acting performances, and an intriguing storyline.Staci Layne Wilson",4,The Remake Actually Improves Upon the Original,1106870400,"01 28, 2005",2005,1767,"['Stephen', 'King', 'miniseries', 'place', 'haunted', 'hospital', 'Maine', 'was', 'built', 'site', 'Civil', 'War-era', 'fire', 'where', 'score', 'helpless', 'children', 'perished', 'King', 'can', 'bet', 'ghosts', 'are', ""n't"", 'too', 'happy', 'lot', 'afterlife', 'chilling', 'comedically', 'off-kilter', 'teleplay', 'one', 'installment', 'was', 'entitled', 'Young', 'Headless', 'strong', 'ensemble', 'cast', 'few', 'searingly', 'memorable', 'talking', 'animal', 'characters', 'One', 'German', 'Shepherd', 'complete', 'Teutonic', 'accent', 'named', 'Blondie', 'voiced', 'Julian', 'Richings', 'verbose', 'pooch', 'called', 'Charlie', 'Ryan', 'Robbins', 'Most', 'striking', 'often', 'malevolent', 'always', 'judicious', 'phantasmagorical', 'anteater', 'CGI', 'modeled', 'real', 'giant', 'anteater', 'voiced', 'Kett', 'Turton', 'named', 'Antubis', 'Antubis', 'long', 'tongue', 'ants', 'hiding', 'very', 'unexpected', 'places', 'Antsolutely', 'delicious', 'dipping', 'insect-infested', 'human', 'brain', 'Based', 'Danish', 'miniseries', 'called', 'Kingdom', 'Lars', 'von', 'Trier.What', 'difference', 'DVD', 'concentration-blowing', 'commercial', 'interruptions', 'luxury', 'being', 'able', 'watch', 'much', 'as', 'little', '13', 'hour', 'opus', 'one', 'likes', 'Kingdom', 'Hospital', 'lot', 'better', 'not', 'say', 'perfect', 'miniseries', 'pretty', 'weird', 'getting', 'almost', 'lost', 'few', 'times', 'weirdness', 'felt', 'music', 'choices', 'were', 'really', 'inappropriate', 'rather', 'irritating', 'thought', 'one', 'scene', 'doctors', 'breaking', 'song-and-dance', 'routine', 'was', 'far', 'too', 'Cop', 'Rock', 'stick', 'quirky', 'eccentricity', 'Kingdom', 'Hospital', 'will', 'reward', 'terrific', 'characters', 'excellent', 'acting', 'performances', 'intriguing', 'storyline.Staci', 'Layne', 'Wilson']",N/A

This being a Stephen King led adaptation you know he has a certain style all his own that he invested into Kingdom Hospital and you either like it enough to give it a chance or not.  Just remember before dismissing it out of hand, Kingdom Hospital is not exactly typical Stephen King fare.I stumbled on the hacked up all day version of Kingdom Hospital while watching SCI FI Channel during a recent day off. I had always caught bits and pieces of Kingdom Hospital and always found it profoundly eerie, camp and creepy yet funny in ways I feel no words can adequately convey.Basically a state of the art medical center is built on the site of an old New England sweat shop employing children.  Most of these civil war era child workers died after being abandoned by adult overseer's more intent on saving themselves.Then there was ""The Old Kingdom"" hospital built on the site of the civil war factory where a mad doctor performed many evil horrid experiments on patients.  The Old Kingdom Hospital was replaced by a pretty new chrome and glass state of the art medical center.  The New Kingdom Hospital or New Kingdom is beautiful.  This nice modern new Kingdom hospital rests on the haunted site rich with restless ghosts, troubled, spirits and a tangled weave of both the psychic and the psychotic goings on.Kingdom Hospital is not really a horror movie with overt shockingly sick twisted tortured horrid things popping out of the woodwork at every turn as was the case in Stephen King's Rose Red.  Kingdom Hospital is amazingly subtle in its slow but steady pace each episode constructing a complex interplay of odd characters and even odder situations.  Yes there is the giant anteater like creature Antubis who does some really weird stuff.  There is the lost little girl Mary trapped in the New Kingdom who walks the line being at times both frightened and frightening.The odd ball doctors, patients and others working at New Kingdom Hospital effectively suggest that at the Kingdom Hospital as in real life, the more things change the more they stay the same.  Among the doctors of the New Kingdom Hospital you have doctors with the same character flaws and twisted self indulgent, arrogantly self absorbed over inflated egos that ruled the twisted mad doctor(s) of the Old Kingdom Hospital.  It is the subtle interplay between good and evil like a devils dance that makes Kingdom Hospital so much a joy to watch.  Is Kingdom Hospital one of Stephen Kings better works yes! but only if you allow Kingdom Hospital to be the ode to a quirkish unsettling brand of unease bordering on horror that never crosses the line that it was meant to be in my humble opinion.Kingdom Hospital stirs the good and evil inside each viewer's brain and allows the plot to develop differently for each individual.  Kingdom Hospital is neither Horror nor Thriller.  Kingdom Hospital if you allow it becomes something unique in the minds of any viewer to gives it an honest and fair chance.  I love Kingdom Hospital so much I brought the whole set because, sometimes I do not want to be horrified, shocked or thrilled sometimes all I want to be is fascinated and that's what Kingdom Hospital does well, it FASCINATES THE MIND IN PLAYFUL BLACK MACARBE WAYS THAT INTOXICATE THE SOUL!Kingdom Hospital deserves to be part of your collection because it fascinates the dark portions of your mind in the most unique ways if you allow it to do its work.",5,Kingdom Hospital Fascinating and Just Off Beat Enough to Keep Your Interest,1165017600,"12 2, 2006",2006,3560,"['First', 'Stephen', 'King', 'adaptation', 'work', 'Danish', 'fiction', 'so', 'many', 'others', 'have', 'already', 'said', 'so', 'wo', ""n't"", 'go', 'there', 'being', 'Stephen', 'King', 'led', 'adaptation', 'know', 'certain', 'style', 'own', 'invested', 'Kingdom', 'Hospital', 'either', 'enough', 'give', 'chance', 'not', 'Just', 'remember', 'dismissing', 'hand', 'Kingdom', 'Hospital', 'not', 'exactly', 'typical', 'Stephen', 'King', 'fare.I', 'stumbled', 'hacked', 'up', 'day', 'version', 'Kingdom', 'Hospital', 'watching', 'SCI', 'FI', 'Channel', 'recent', 'day', 'had', 'always', 'caught', 'bits', 'pieces', 'Kingdom', 'Hospital', 'always', 'found', 'profoundly', 'camp', 'creepy', 'yet', 'funny', 'ways', 'feel', 'words', 'can', 'adequately', 'convey.Basically', 'state', 'art', 'medical', 'center', 'built', 'site', 'old', 'New', 'England', 'sweat', 'shop', 'employing', 'children', 'Most', 'civil', 'war', 'era', 'child', 'workers', 'died', 'being', 'abandoned', 'adult', 'overseer', 'more', 'intent', 'saving', 'themselves.Then', 'was', 'Old', 'Kingdom', 'hospital', 'built', 'site', 'civil', 'war', 'factory', 'where', 'mad', 'doctor', 'performed', 'many', 'evil', 'horrid', 'experiments', 'patients', 'Old', 'Kingdom', 'Hospital', 'was', 'replaced', 'pretty', 'new', 'chrome', 'glass', 'state', 'art', 'medical', 'center', 'New', 'Kingdom', 'Hospital', 'New', 'Kingdom', 'beautiful', 'nice', 'modern', 'new', 'Kingdom', 'hospital', 'rests', 'haunted', 'site', 'rich', 'restless', 'ghosts', 'troubled', 'spirits', 'tangled', 'weave', 'psychic', 'psychotic', 'goings', 'Hospital', 'not', 'really', 'horror', 'movie', 'overt', 'shockingly', 'sick', 'twisted', 'tortured', 'horrid', 'things', 'popping', 'woodwork', 'turn', 'was', 'case', 'Stephen', 'King', 'Rose', 'Red', 'Kingdom', 'Hospital', 'amazingly', 'subtle', 'slow', 'steady', 'pace', 'episode', 'constructing', 'complex', 'interplay', 'odd', 'characters', 'even', 'odder', 'situations', 'giant', 'anteater', 'creature', 'Antubis', 'who', 'really', 'weird', 'stuff', 'lost', 'little', 'girl', 'Mary', 'trapped', 'New', 'Kingdom', 'who', 'walks', 'line', 'being', 'times', 'frightened', 'frightening.The', 'odd', 'ball', 'doctors', 'patients', 'others', 'working', 'New', 'Kingdom', 'Hospital', 'effectively', 'suggest', 'Kingdom', 'Hospital', 'real', 'life', 'more', 'things', 'change', 'more', 'stay', 'same', 'doctors', 'New', 'Kingdom', 'Hospital', 'have', 'doctors', 'same', 'character', 'flaws', 'twisted', 'self', 'indulgent', 'arrogantly', 'absorbed', 'inflated', 'egos', 'ruled', 'twisted', 'mad', 'doctor', 's', 'Old', 'Kingdom', 'Hospital', 'subtle', 'interplay', 'good', 'evil', 'devils', 'dance', 'Kingdom', 'Hospital', 'so', 'much', 'joy', 'watch', 'Kingdom', 'Hospital', 'one', 'Stephen', 'Kings', 'better', 'yes', 'only', 'allow', 'Kingdom', 'Hospital', 'be', 'ode', 'quirkish', 'unsettling', 'brand', 'unease', 'bordering', 'horror', 'never', 'line', 'was', 'meant', 'be', 'humble', 'opinion.Kingdom', 'Hospital', 'stirs', 'good', 'evil', 'viewer', 'brain', 'plot', 'develop', 'differently', 'individual', 'Kingdom', 'Hospital', 'Horror', 'Thriller', 'Kingdom', 'Hospital', 'allow', 'something', 'unique', 'minds', 'viewer', 'honest', 'fair', 'chance', 'love', 'Kingdom', 'Hospital', 'so', 'much', 'brought', 'whole', 'set', 'sometimes', 'do', 'not', 'want', 'be', 'horrified', 'shocked', 'thrilled', 'sometimes', 'want', 'be', 'fascinated', 'what', 'Kingdom', 'Hospital', 'well', 'FASCINATES', 'THE', 'MIND', 'IN', 'PLAYFUL', 'BLACK', 'MACARBE', 'WAYS', 'THAT', 'THE', 'SOUL', 'Kingdom', 'Hospital', 'be', 'part', 'collection', 'dark', 'portions', 'mind', 'most', 'unique', 'ways', 'allow', 'do', 'work']",N/A

498166,AQP1VPK16SVWM,B00000F3SB,"Wayne Klein ""If at first the idea is not absu...","[134, 140]","First, let's clear up a misconception. ""Kingdom Hospital"" was created specifically as a limited series with a beginning, middle and end. Like ""The Prisoner"", King had envisioned it as a ""true"" novel for television. If ABC had chosen to renew it, King would have developed a series of different story arcs. So it wasn't cancelled so much as it concluded. Another point to clear up--King's series created in collaboration with co-writer Richard Dooling, director Craig Baxley, executive producer Mark Carliner was an attempt to graft King's unique sense of humor and horror to Lars Van Trier's original allowing it to reach an American audience better.King's series is every bit as effective in its own way as Lars Van Trier's ""The Kingdom"" but one made for a very different audience. An American audience. Since Lars Van Trier was an executive producer on the series, I doubt that he would have given it his blessing if he didn't see King's version as a quirky complimentary vision to his own. A warning, though, about ""Kingdom Hospital"". This is a ghost story not a horror thriller. The show unfolds at a leisurely pace allowing the story to unfold gradually creating suspense vs. a rapid fire horror story. ""Kingdom Hospital"" has more in common with, say, ""The Stand"" or even ""Twin Peaks"" (and the original source mini-series as well) in that regard.Anyhow, on to the DVD. Looks terrific and the CGI effects are top notch throughout most of the series. The campy over-the-top acting style of this ""E.R."" meets ""Twin Peaks""series is crossed with King's twisted imagination. In the first episode we're introduced to most of the main characters at The Kingdom--Hook (Andrew McCarthy), Sally (Diane Ladd) the psychic who appears to be more than a few bricks shy of a full load, Jack (Peter Rickman)an artist who, due to a terrible accident, ends up at Kingdom (and is a stand-in so to speak for King in a bizarre collison between art and life). Oh and who can forget Stegman (Bruce Davison)who has an aura of...evil about him. All must help save Kingdom Hospital and a little girl who died on the same grounds the hospital is build on by the name of Mary. By the way, the number 19 shows up quite a bit in the series...linking it to King's The Dark Tower series.The two hour pilot has an audio commentary by King, director Buxley, producer Carliner and the visual effects supervisor. There's also a number of great featurettes included on this four disc set including ""Inside the Walls"" which focuses on the making of the series, a discussion of the various characters,a  discussion on the creation of the visual effects for the bizarre looking Antubis as well as a tour of the hospital. King also contributes a two page essay on the series in the booklet enclosed with the first two disc set. The transfer is in high definition so it looks amazingly sharp and crisp.While the series doesn't quite live up to its potential by the conclusion, it's still a fascinating and fun ride while it lasts. It's not exactly a horror series per se more a glimpse into the haunted lives of those bound to serve in ""the kingdom"".",4,Someone's dying to meet you....,1097539200,"10 12, 2004",2004,3112,"['First', 'let', 'clear', 'misconception', 'Kingdom', 'Hospital', 'was', 'created', 'specifically', 'limited', 'series', 'beginning', 'middle', 'end', 'Prisoner', 'King', 'had', 'envisioned', 'true', 'novel', 'television', 'ABC', 'had', 'chosen', 'renew', 'King', 'would', 'have', 'developed', 'series', 'different', 'story', 'arcs', 'was', ""n't"", 'cancelled', 'so', 'much', 'concluded', 'point', 'clear', 'up', 'King', 'series', 'created', 'collaboration', 'co-writer', 'Richard', 'Dooling', 'director', 'Craig', 'Baxley', 'executive', 'producer', 'Mark', 'Carliner', 'was', 'attempt', 'graft', 'King', 'unique', 'sense', 'humor', 'horror', 'Lars', 'Van', 'Trier', 'original', 'allowing', 'reach', 'American', 'audience', 'better.King', 'series', 'bit', 'effective', 'own', 'way', 'Lars', 'Van', 'Trier', 'Kingdom', 'one', 'made', 'very', 'different', 'audience', 'American', 'audience', 'Lars', 'Van', 'Trier', 'was', 'executive', 'producer', 'series', 'doubt', 'would', 'have', 'given', 'blessing', 'did', ""n't"", 'see', 'King', 'version', 'quirky', 'complimentary', 'vision', 'own', 'warning', 'though', 'Kingdom', 'Hospital', 'ghost', 'story', 'not', 'horror', 'thriller', 'show', 'leisurely', 'pace', 'allowing', 'story', 'unfold', 'gradually', 'creating', 'suspense', 'vs.', 'rapid', 'fire', 'horror', 'story', 'Kingdom', 'Hospital', 'more', 'common', 'say', 'Stand', 'even', 'Twin', 'Peaks', 'original', 'source', 'mini-series', 'well', 'regard.Anyhow', 'DVD', 'Looks', 'terrific', 'CGI', 'effects', 'are', 'top', 'notch', 'most', 'series', 'campy', 'over-the-top', 'acting', 'style', 'E.R', 'Twin', 'Peaks', 'series', 'crossed', 'King', 'twisted', 'imagination', 'first', 'episode', ""'re"", 'introduced', 'most', 'main', 'characters', 'Kingdom', 'Hook', 'Andrew', 'McCarthy', 'Sally', 'Diane', 'Ladd', 'psychic', 'who', 'be', 'more', 'few', 'bricks', 'shy', 'full', 'load', 'Jack', 'Peter', 'Rickman', 'artist', 'who', 'due', 'terrible', 'accident', 'up', 'Kingdom', 'stand-in', 'so', 'speak', 'King', 'bizarre', 'collison', 'art', 'life', 'Oh', 'who', 'can', 'forget', 'Stegman', 'Bruce', 'Davison', 'who', 'aura', 'evil', 'must', 'help', 'save', 'Kingdom', 'Hospital', 'little', 'girl', 'who', 'died', 'same', 'hospital', 'build', 'name', 'Mary', 'way', 'number', '19', 'up', 'quite', 'bit', 'series', 'linking', 'King', 'Dark', 'Tower', 'series.The', 'two', 'hour', 'pilot', 'audio', 'commentary', 'King', 'director', 'Buxley', 'producer', 'Carliner', 'visual', 'effects', 'supervisor', 'also', 'number', 'great', 'featurettes', 'included', 'four', 'disc', 'set', 'including', 'Walls', 'making', 'series', 'discussion', 'various', 'characters', 'discussion', 'creation', 'visual', 'effects', 'bizarre', 'looking', 'Antubis', 'as', 'well', 'tour', 'hospital', 'King', 'also', 'two', 'page', 'essay', 'series', 'booklet', 'enclosed', 'first', 'two', 'disc', 'set', 'transfer', 'high', 'definition', 'amazingly', 'sharp', 'crisp.While', 'series', ""n't"", 'quite', 'live', 'up', 'potential', 'conclusion', 'still', 'fascinating', 'fun', 'ride', 'not', 'exactly', 'horror', 'series', 'se', 'more', 'glimpse', 'haunted', 'lives', 'bound', 'serve', 'kingdom']",N/A

498168,A20WKQ948WZOQJ,B00000F3SB,Wes Saylors Jr.,"[2, 2]","Stephen King's 'Kingdom Hospital' is definitely several notches better than 'Rose Red' but not so satisfying as his recent remake of Salem's Lot.  I think that if there is a problem in this latest edition to the King library of miniseries, it is that the ending is not as rewarding as every episode leading up to it ... and every episode leading up to it is terrific.  Kingdom Hospital lies atop a grave that isn't quite sure what to do with its dead.  This uncertainty manifests itself in the form of earthquakes and general weirdness.  And the weirdness actually doesn't feel too forced (unlike the bewildering final gasps of Twin Peaks), mixing black comedy and real terror in a pretty seamless blend.  Stephen King has used the former Brat Pack ensemble to great effect.  This time he uses Andrew McCarthy as the gallant Dr. Hook, and Andrew turns in the performance of his career.  He really is terrific in this.  Well, in fact, everyone is terrific ... stand-outs being Ed Begley, Jr. who has pretty much nailed the mixing of the brilliant and the befuddled.  Bruce Davison is nothing short of amazing as the evil but somehow lovable Dr. Stegman .. a guy who has the emotional restraint of Gene Wilder in 'Young Frankenstein'.  And everything goes along swell until the final episode on the final disc.  It isn't bad .. and Bruce Davison is in top form .. but it feels so unresolved.  Many many many things brought up in the preceding episodes are not even addressed, and the final explanation seems like much ado about nothing.  But before the finale, Kingdom Hospital is absorbing and challenging and a great deal of fun.",4,King and Brat Packers Make Good Play Mates,1113264000,"04 12, 2005",2005,1629,"['Stephen', 'King', ""'Kingdom"", 'Hospital', 'definitely', 'several', 'notches', 'better', ""'Rose"", 'Red', 'not', 'so', 'satisfying', 'recent', 'remake', 'Salem', 'Lot', 'think', 'problem', 'latest', 'edition', 'King', 'library', 'miniseries', 'ending', 'not', 'as', 'rewarding', 'episode', 'leading', 'up', 'episode', 'leading', 'up', 'terrific', 'Kingdom', 'Hospital', 'grave', ""n't"", 'quite', 'sure', 'what', 'do', 'dead', 'uncertainty', 'form', 'earthquakes', 'general', 'weirdness', 'weirdness', 'actually', ""n't"", 'feel', 'too', 'forced', 'bewildering', 'final', 'gasps', 'Twin', 'Peaks', 'mixing', 'black', 'comedy', 'real', 'terror', 'pretty', 'seamless', 'blend', 'Stephen', 'King', 'used', 'former', 'Brat', 'Pack', 'ensemble', 'great', 'effect', 'time', 'Andrew', 'McCarthy', 'gallant', 'Dr.', 'Hook', 'Andrew', 'performance', 'career', 'really', 'terrific', 'Well', 'fact', 'everyone', 'terrific', 'stand-outs', 'being', 'Ed', 'Begley', 'Jr.', 'who', 'pretty', 'much', 'nailed', 'mixing', 'brilliant', 'befuddled', 'Bruce', 'Davison', 'nothing', 'short', 'amazing', 'evil', 'somehow', 'lovable', 'Dr.', 'Stegman', '..', 'guy', 'who', 'emotional', 'restraint', 'Gene', 'Wilder', ""'Young"", 'Frankenstein', 'everything', 'along', 'swell', 'final', 'episode', 'final', 'disc', ""n't"", 'bad', '..', 'Bruce', 'Davison', 'top', 'form', '..', 'so', 'unresolved', 'Many', 'many', 'many', 'things', 'brought', 'up', 'preceding', 'episodes', 'are', 'not', 'even', 'addressed', 'final', 'explanation', 'much', 'ado', 'nothing', 'finale', 'Kingdom', 'Hospital', 'absorbing', 'challenging', 'great', 'deal', 'fun']",N/A
