I think she comes off as pompous and self-centered in all her movies...with the exception of this one.She plays a girl named Hilary, a bright, intelligent girl who is trapped in a world of limited funds and virtually no career advancement. She deserves better, but she's not likely to find it in her dead-end, working-class milieu. Salt in the wounds is added by her insensitive mother who compares her unfavorably to her, Hilary's, peers and by an unfaithful boyfriend. Seeking a way out, she answers a help-wanted ad for a nurse/companion to a critically ill young man. She fudges the interview and is promptly dismissed. Her pride wounded, she bolts down the sidewalk street of the affluent San Francisco neighorhood only to be called back by the ubiquitous butler, Malachy, who informs her that the job is hers. Turns out that Victor, the critically ill young man, was surreptitiously observing her during the interview and has chosen her over many much more qualified candidates.The pay and fringe benefits are a dream come true for Hilary, who promptly moves into Victor's mansion as his live-in nurse/companion. When he isn't busy showing her slides of Klimpt's work and debriefing her on Art History 101, he is either going for chemo in the hospital or throwing up at home. We suddenly don't envy Hilary, as she more than earns her pay and keep in these trying duties. Victor and Hilary are from different worlds: he turns her on to Klimpt; she turns him on to the local bar scene. Each learns from the other. And Hilary, the impoverished girl from the other side of the tracks, gives Victor the one thing that all his money can't buy him: the joy of life and the desire to live. I deducted a star because it was unclear whether or not Victor would live at the end of the movie.

304296,A328S9RN3U5M68,6302256690,Grady Harp,"[3, 4]","DYING YOUNG has many of the markings of an Indie movie - good story, fine script, exploration of sensitive subject matter, solid acting.  But this 1991 Joel Schumacher film has big stars, gorgeous settings, and as fine a music score as you can imagine, so it proves that Hollywood can get to the core of fine message film making after all.Hilary O'Neil (Julia Roberts, radiant and in peak form acting-wise) lives in Oakland, CA with her ditzy demeaning mother (Ellen Burstyn) and has a lousy boyfriend and clearly needs a new life.  She finds a job description in the newspaper that leads her to apply for a position of a nurse to a family living on elegant Nob Hill in San Francisco.  Clearly out of her element but determined to better her life, she fakes her way through an interview with a Mr. Geddes (David Selby) and his butler Malachi (George Martin) and overheard by Victor Geddes (Cameron Scott), the son who has been living with leukemia for 10 years, only to be dismissed as unacceptable.  After storming out of the mansion in disgust, Hilary is followed by Malachi who says she must come back for another interview - this time with Victor who is impressed with what he heard and saw and ultimately hires her.Hilary's life changes dramatically as she lives in elegance and discovers the difficulties of caring for a cancer patient on cyclical chemotherapy.  Between Victor's near-death bouts of post chemotherapy side effects, Victor shares his writings about art, introducing her to the works of Klimt and Rosetti and the joys of classical music.  Hilary shares her lifestyle of bars and disco with Victor and the two become bonded.  They eventually take a vacation after Victor informs her his chemotherapy is over and they enjoy the bliss of the wine country where they are nourished by friends, among whom are the wise Estelle Whittier (Colleen Dewhurst) and the funky Gordon (Vincent D'Onofrio).  It is evident that Hilary learns from Victor and Victor from Hilary and it is a sharing and bonding that is beautiful and wholly believable.  The film ends quietly with a tremendous reverence for life.All of the actors give excellent performances and Schumacher paces the fluid action with such skill that he allows us to enter the lives of these people with grace and naturalness.  It is good to encounter a film with heart that knows its message and its bounds.

304304,A3DN1U4KB4XWQ1,6302256690,Sam Clemens,"[0, 2]","Enjoyed the picture, and particularly appreciated how the two main characters inhabited very different worlds.  The male lead is art graduate student working on his doctoral thesis, well educated, but lacking in human sensitivity.  Who is suffering from leukemia. The female lead is a likeable working-class gal, with little education, but some smarts and heart, who answers an ad for a live-in support person. The film sported a fine musical score and excellent production values.  I found myself wondering what other work Campbell Scott has done, as he was decent in this role.Yet, I find I have ""had it"" with the hackneyed theme of a cancer patient relying on obsolete, yet conventional, oncology treatment...suffering with serious chemo-related side-effects (Well, duh, this is mind-numbingly horrific poison you are injecting!), improves, then ultimately succumbs.  Sure, it's sad (lots of pathos!), but more exactly pitiful...as an educated person would have some awareness of alternative cancer theory and treatment methods, or would make some effort to secure someone competent in this field..or read some books, for Christ's sake.  Or consult the Cancer Control Society for information and referrals.  There was a slight nod in this direction, in that the female character provided her ward more wholesome meals and herbs, and insisted he stop smoking.The reality is that providing some alternative measures, while continuing with conventional therapy (like the regimen of the highly advertised Cancer Treatment Centers of America these days) is akin to washing down arsenic-laced cookies with a solidly nutritious smoothie at the neighborhood health food store.  In a word, nuts.One who understands the nature and etiology of cancerous tissue will understand that the ""Terrible Triad"" of surgery, chemo and radiation is precisely the ""wrong way to go.""  For a start, Google ""Cancer, Dr. Otto Warburg"" or ""Cancer, Alternative therapy,"" and use your noggin for something more than holding up your Stetson.

304305,A2EGK0YRDF4ZZB,6302256690,"Sarah ""Eat Dessert First""","[7, 9]","""Dying Young,"" based on the novel of the same name by Marti Leimbach, follows the adventures of Oakland native Hilary O'Neil (a luminous Julia Roberts), a beautiful and frustrated young woman who lives at home with her annoying mother (a woefully underutilized Ellen Burstyn). Hilary's struck out on both a satisfying career and her love life. Determined to move out from under her mother's grasp, she answers a newspaper ad for someone with medical experience. She trudges up Nob Hill in a super-short miniskirt and red heels to discover her would-be employer Victor is a wealthy, intelligent recluse (Campbell Scott, son of George C. and Colleen Dewhurst) with recurring leukemia. Victor has been through bouts of chemo in-between remissions for the last ten years, and he's looking for a nurse to care for him during the latest round of treatment.I had a former teacher and friend die from adult-onset leukemia ten years ago, and I felt that the film does a decent job at scratching the surface of the physical and mental suffering that chemo induces. Chemo basically loads a person with a cocktail of poisons in the hope of killing off the cancer before it kills off the patient. Side effects include brutal nausea and vomiting (although there are newer and more effective antiemetics in the two decades since this was filmed), mouth sores, numerous digestive problems (the chemo solutions frequently damage the GI tract), a flu-like syndrome (fever and chills), joint and muscle pain, weight loss, insomnia, and impotence. Those who are squeamish may find it difficult to watch several scenes of chemo-induced vomiting and other graphic side effects.Hilary had no idea what to expect when Victor said that he'd need help; beyond the immediate cleaning up from bouts of vomiting, he goes through excruciating periods of physical and mental suffering, which almost prove too much for her. Initially, their relationship is strictly business; she cleans up after him and cares for him, he pays her 400 a week plus a room of her own in the mansion. But Hilary begins to sense Victor's life before leukemia struck at 18; we see a series of photos of a young, confident Victor participating in sports and smiling from a happier time. Victor's decade-long bout with chemo has left him bitter and reclusive and he's loath to leave the mansion, but Hilary coaxes him out of his shell. The two go to a fancy restaurant and are served carpaccio (raw cow). In a tender role reversal, when Hilary discovers what it's made of, she frets ""What if I throw up?"" to which Victor tenderly replies, ""I'll take care of you.""Robert's character seems to care for Victor out of compassion more than love. Victor is prickly, detached, petulant and superior (he's been working on his PhD dissertation on art history), and outwardly gives little reason to love him. His desire for Hilary is fueled by his acute loneliness and fears about dying (the survival rates for various adult-onset leukemias are still only 14 to 50% for five-year survival). Desperate to escape the vicious cycle of chemo, Victor decides to rent a cottage in Mendocino and convinces Hilary to accompany him. I felt a sense of d&eacute;j&agrave; vu as Roberts is given an impromptu lesson in art history as repayment for her kindness (in her more recent filmMona Lisa Smile, Roberts plays a wordly art history professor at a restrictive girls' college in a role reversal from Dying Young). The scenery and cinematography are particularly gorgeous in these segments; rich panoramas of sea and sky fill the screen, and the film's poignant love theme by Kenny G. (Dying Young: Original Soundtrack Album) floats ethereally through tender montages of happier times.Victor and Hilary initially play at housekeeping and married life; his hair grows back, and he's able to go for walks and do more physical activities. But the vacation in paradise is short-lived; it turns out that Victor's been hiding a dark secret of his own, one which terrifies and infuriates Hilary. The film falters in the middle: a potential rival, good-natured blue collar handyman Gordon (Vincent D'Onofrio) relates more easily with the street-smart Hilary than the intellectual Victor is able to. Gordon and Hilary bond over sitcom trivia and other blue-collar pursuits, while Victor loves to belittle Gordon with displays of his worldliness and superior book learning. In the book and original cut of the movie, Hilary has a full-fledged affair with Gordon under Vincent's nose, but due to poor test audience reactions, it was dropped, so the lightweight inclusion of Gordon felt forced and unnecessary. Also, the film's original ending (more in line with the darker mood of the book) was changed after poor test reactions. A side plot involving eccentric winery owner Estelle (Campbell Scott's real-life mother Colleen Dewhurst, in one of her last film roles before her death) and her eccentric garden maze seemed out of place (other than showing the return of Victor's illness as he struggles to complete the maze).The tearjerker climax features both Hilary and Victor struggling to voice their deepest fears, and this was my biggest problem with the movie. I realize that chemo treatment has improved over the last twenty years, but if I had already struggled through a decade of chemo, I would want my family to respect my right to refuse treatment. That's never presented as an option. Despite strong performances by Scott and Roberts (who seems to be reprising her role inPretty Woman (15th Anniversary Special Edition)without breaking a sweat), I never felt an attachment to Victor and Hilary as a couple; he seemed too controlling and self-centered, and instead of offering compassion towards Hilary's upbringing on ""the other side of the tracks,"" he tries to mold her in his image. This is more of an issue with the screenplay than the actors' performances: indeed, Campbell Scott in particular is completely invisible as an actor; instead, we see the raw desperation and fear of a frightened human being living with a death sentence.Overall, it's a solid film that's worth seeing at least once, if only for one of Campbell Scott's finest performances (I first saw him in the Hallmark moviesFollow The Stars HomeandThe Love Letter). As for Julia Roberts, she's beautiful, but I felt a sense of emotional detachment from Hilary. The DVD offers very few extras except for a few minutes of B-roll footage and two original trailers for Dying Young; the original ending isn't present. And a final thought: just like the U.S. retitling of ""Inside I'm Dancing"" asRory O'Shea Was Here, naming a movie about a cancer victim as ""Dying Young"" kind of lets the cat out of the bag; I preferred the European title A Choice of Love.",3,A tender (though flawed) love story where love and death intertwine,1232150400,"01 17, 2009",2009,6745,"['Dying', 'Young', 'based', 'novel', 'same',

304307,A27A3AZA7L12N6,6302256690,Stephen M. Bauer,"[10, 12]","Initially I was a little disappointed that the story didn't go deep enough, but as time goes on, I find myself feeling very fond of the movie.Hillary O'Neil (Julia Roberts) needs a job and a place to live, and so interviews for a live-in position taking care of a sick person in the ultra-wealthy neighborhood of Nob Hill in San Francisco.  The job calls for some nursing skills, which she doesn't have.  She flunks the interview.  However, the young man who is sick, Victor Geddes (Campbell Scott), is secretly watching the interview.  He overrides the interviewer and hires her. The job pays $400.00 a week, plus room and meals, which for Hillary is the good life.Victor, Geddes Hillary learns, is a Phd. student in art history who has completed everything but his thesis.  His thesis is about two, or several, German impressionists.  He shows Hillary slides of their paintings.  The artists were obsessed with the women they were painting.  One of the artists, Clint, has a number of paintings of a thin woman with big, flaming red hair.The connection between Hillary and the red head in Clint's paintings wasn't pulled off very well.  We still feel like Victor hired Hillary mostly for her looks, independent of anything else.  It still comes off more as a coincidence than one of the reasons he hired her.Hillary comes from a background where she worked in Diners, parties in clubs and discos and sleeps with construction workers.  Victor comes from a background that included butlers, personal assistants, never learning to drive because his family employed a full-time driver.  The two have a lot to learn from each other.She doesn't know what she got herself in for.  Victor has Leukemia.  One of Hillary's jobs is to accompany him to chemotherapy treatments at the hospital and take care of him afterwards.  Hillary has quite a strong reaction to just seeing the rest of the patients, large in number, at the chemotherapy ward in the hospital.  It's a normal, human reaction.  I don't blame her.  I would react the same.Hillary is the type of person, who, when the going got too tough, always packed her bags and left.  She was without a place to live because she had walked in on her live-in guy, in bed with another woman.  So Hillary packed her bags and left.  After returning home from the hospital, Hillary has a temper tantrum, because she can't deal with it, and packs her bags.  Luckily she didn't leave.We see scene after scene after scene of Victor suffering the after-effects of chemotherapy.  The impact of chemo, as show in the movie, can't be underestimated.  No wonder when people speak of chemo they tend to do it in the same hushed tones as the big ""C"" itself.In any movie with a young good-looking female and male lead, we viewers expect, or hope, they fall in love.  This aspect, I feel was handled well, somewhat realistically.  Hillary is ambiguous throughout.  They become close; they become friends, but any normal woman would hold back from falling in love with someone in Victor's shape.  Nothing in the movie was suggestive of gold digging, except for a remark by Hillary's mother, and that's to be expected.Victor intentions are much less ambiguous than Hillary's.  He just doesn't spell out what they are, early on.  In the latter part of the movie, Victor lies to Hillary and tells her he no longer needs chemo and takes Hillary to a vacation house in the country.  The truth is, Victor has renounced any more chemotherapy, and what he wants to do in the country is to try and live normally for a time before he dies.  You can't blame him.Victor's life has been cold and isolated.  He tells Hillary early on that his father, a lawyer, is in Japan on business while suffers through chemotherapy.  When Victor first hires Hillary, she subtly and insinuatingly manages to probe if Victor has hired her with the intention of sleeping with her.  Victor bluntly replies that there have been other women in the house before.  What Victor is looking for is love and intimacy.My hope for Hillary's character is that the experience will help her to put her own problems in better perspective.  Can't deal with seeing the chemo ward?  Try having leukemia yourself.  Hillary can always pack her bags and leave.  Victor cannot.  My hope for the viewer is that s/he comes away with a respect for the life of the dying.Julia Roberts' and Campbell Scott's roles were balanced, but the film focuses more on the drama surrounding Hillary rather than Campbell Scott.  Although looking at the problems associated with being the caretaker for someone dying of cancer is a legitimate one, the person with the cancer has the bigger problem.  Campbell Scott should have been the lead role.  His was the far more dramatic viewpoint.Hillary O'Neil was a more sober role for Julia Roberts than her usual movies, although the personal side of Hillary was similar to the Pretty Woman and Erin Brockavich roles.  This is what viewers have come to expect of her.  I find that one of Julia Robert's most interesting strengths as an actress and a woman is that she is capable of turning on hundreds of different facial expressions showing all sorts of nuanced feelings, attitudes, shades of emotions, colors and facets.  This story was a perfect vehicle to exploit that talent, but we see little of it.What is disappointing is that given the material and the cast, the producers, director and screen writers should been able to create a much more powerful movie.",3,Touching and romantic,1028332800,"08 3, 2002",2002,5467,"['Initially', 'was', 'little', 'disappointed', 'story', 'did', ""n't"", 'go', 'deep', 'enough',

304309,A4JHEO7H330AF,6302256690,Tom Brody,"[1, 2]","DYING YOUNG is a story about a pair of twenty-somethings, who are thrown together by way of a newspaper advertisement for a nurse. Campbell Scott plays a 28 year old graduate student in art history, who is enrolled at Yale University, but elects to stay at home in his Pacific Heights home in San Francisco, because of his need for extended chemotherapy. Julia Roberts plays a 23 year old nurse wannabe, who answers a newspaper add requesting a nurse to take care of Mr.Scott. Campbell Scott is the son of George C. Scott, one of Hollywood's most famous actors.For those not familiar with the San Francisco Bay area, Pacific Heights is where the wealthiest of wealthy make their homes. The character played by Julia Roberts lives in the crime-ridden, un-glamorous city of Oakland. The cinematographer accurately portrays Oakland's lower class neighborhoods (where Julia Roberts lives), as being the home of a harmonious melange of Asians, Latinos, and African-Americans. Anybody can visit the small Chinatown in Oakland, located in between Webster Street and Broadway, and see a neighborhood that is similar to that in the movie. Julia Roberts plays an uneducated type without any particular technical training, who adheres (but not fanatically so) to an array of superstitious beliefs regarding nutrition and diet. Ms.Roberts' beliefs regarding diet are a distict improvement over the dietary habits of the Campbell Scott's character. Mr.Scott's diet, as shown in the movie, consists of Hostess Twinkies supplemented with cigarette smoking.Okay, these two characters are thrown together. Then what happens? The storyline allows the two characters to click together and to develop together. This is a good thing. The graduate student has a father (wealthy attorney), but he is on a business trip in Japan for most of the picture. Ms.Roberts takes care of Mr.Scott when he is vomiting, when he has night sweats, and so on. Then, there are moments of tension. At one point, Ms.Roberts threatens to abandon Mr.Scott, because his bout with leukemia is too stressful for her.Then, the two develop some sort of emotional attraction for each other. This particular pairing is reminiscent to that of Julia Roberts with Richard Gere in the film, PRETTY WOMAN (a pairing which, to my mind, was most improbable but certainly not impossible). Then, Mr.Scott decides to bring Ms.Roberts along on a vacation to the artists' colony in northern California known as Mendocino. The movie does an excellent job at showing the scenery about Mendocino, as well as the charming statue atop city hall in Mendocino. And again, there are more moments of tension, where low-life farmworker living in Mendocino takes a liking to Ms.Roberts, and attempts to steal her from Mr.Scott.The film has a surprise ending, which develops reasonably and with deliberation towards the final dozen minutes of the film. I would like to give the movie FIVE STARS because of choice of filming in Mendocino, but I gave the movie only TWO STARS. Why only TWO STARS? Because I did not exactly care for the love triangle that involved the farmworker. Wasn't the Campbell Scott character under enough stress because of his leukemia? Was there any need for the storyline to subject him to the love triangle, as well? The time spent on showing this love triangle could just as easily have been spent on other activities available in the Mendocino area, such as whale-watching, or a trip on the Skunk Train in nearby Fort Bragg, or perhaps a drive through the Chandelier Tree (a redwood tree) in Leggett, California. Also, the scene with the maze did not fit well into the plot -- it was just something added on. The first half of this movie is fine. But the storyline in the second half of this movie is garbled.",2,"FIVE STARS for the beautiful town of Mendocino featured in this movie, but only TWO STARS for the garbled story",1304467200,"05 4, 2011",2011,3762,"['DYING', 'YOUNG', 'story', 'pair', 'twenty-somethings', 'who', 'are', 'thrown', 'together', 'way', 'newspaper', 'advertisement', 'nurse', 'Campbell', 'Scott', '28', 'year', 'old', 'graduate', 'student', 'art', 'history', 'who', 'enrolled', 'Yale', 'University', 'stay', 'home', 'Pacific', 'Heights', 'home', 'San', 'Francisco', 'need', 'extended', 'chemotherapy', 'Julia', 'Roberts', '23', 'year', 'old', 'nurse', 'wannabe', 'who', 'newspaper', 'add', 'requesting', 'nurse', 'take', 'care', 'Mr.Scott', 'Campbell', 'Scott', 'son', 'George', 'C.', 'Scott', 'one', 'Hollywood', 'most', 'famous', 'actors.For', 'not', 'familiar', 'San', 'Francisco', 'Bay', 'area', 'Pacific', 'Heights', 'where', 'wealthiest', 'wealthy', 'make', 'homes', 'character', 'played', 'Julia', 'Roberts', 'crime-ridden', 'un-glamorous', 'city', 'Oakland', 'cinematographer', 'accurately', 'Oakland', 'lower', 'class', 'neighborhoods', 'where', 'Julia', 'Roberts', 'being', 'home', 'harmonious', 'melange', 'Asians', 'Latinos', 'African-Americans', 'Anybody', 'can', 'visit', 'small', 'Chinatown', 'Oakland', 'located', 'Webster', 'Street', 'Broadway', 'see', 'neighborhood', 'similar', 'movie', 'Julia', 'Roberts', 'uneducated', 'type', 'particular', 'technical', 'training', 'who', 'not', 'fanatically', 'so', 'array', 'superstitious', 'beliefs', 'regarding', 'nutrition', 'diet', 'Ms.Roberts', 'beliefs', 'regarding', 'diet', 'are', 'distict', 'improvement', 'dietary', 'habits', 'Campbell', 'Scott', 'character', 'Mr.Scott', 'diet', 'shown', 'movie', 'Hostess', 'Twinkies', 'supplemented', 'cigarette', 'smoking.Okay', 'two', 'characters', 'are', 'thrown', 'together', 'Then', 'what', 'storyline', 'two', 'characters', 'click', 'together', 'develop', 'together', 'good', 'thing', 'graduate', 'student', 'father', 'wealthy', 'attorney', 'business', 'trip', 'Japan', 'most', 'picture', 'Ms.Roberts', 'care', 'Mr.Scott', 'when', 'vomiting', 'when', 'night', 'sweats', 'so', 'Then', 'are', 'moments', 'tension', 'one', 'point', 'Ms.Roberts', 'abandon', 'Mr.Scott', 'bout', 'leukemia', 'too', 'stressful', 'her.Then', 'two', 'develop', 'sort', 'emotional', 'attraction', 'other', 'particular', 'pairing', 'reminiscent', 'Julia', 'Roberts', 'Richard', 'Gere', 'film', 'PRETTY', 'WOMAN', 'pairing', 'mind', 'was', 'most', 'improbable', 'certainly', 'not', 'impossible', 'Then', 'Mr.Scott', 'bring', 'Ms.Roberts', 'vacation', 'artists', 'colony', 'northern', 'California', 'known', 'Mendocino', 'movie', 'excellent', 'job', 'showing', 'scenery', 'Mendocino', 'as', 'well', 'charming', 'statue', 'atop', 'city', 'hall', 'Mendocino', 'again', 'are', 'more', 'moments', 'tension', 'where', 'low-life', 'farmworker', 'living', 'Mendocino', 'liking', 'Ms.Roberts', 'attempts', 'steal', 'Mr.Scott.The', 'film', 'surprise', 'ending', 'reasonably', 'deliberation', 'final', 'dozen', 'minutes', 'film', 'would', 'like', 'give', 'movie', 'FIVE', 'STARS', 'choice', 'filming', 'Mendocino', 'gave', 'movie', 'only', 'TWO', 'STARS', 'Why', 'only', 'TWO', 'STARS', 'did', 'not', 'exactly', 'care', 'love', 'triangle', 'involved', 'farmworker', 'Was', ""n't"", 'Campbell', 'Scott', 'character', 'enough', 'stress', 'leukemia', 'Was', 'need', 'storyline', 'subject', 'love', 'triangle', 'well', 'time', 'spent', 'showing', 'love', 'triangle', 'could', 'just', 'easily', 'have', 'been', 'spent', 'other', 'activities', 'available', 'Mendocino', 'area', 'such', 'whale-watching', 'trip', 'Skunk', 'Train', 'nearby', 'Fort', 'Bragg', 'perhaps', 'drive', 'Chandelier', 'Tree', 'redwood', 'tree', 'Leggett', 'California', 'Also', 'scene', 'maze', 'did', 'not', 'fit', 'well', 'plot', 'was', 'just', 'something', 'added', 'first', 'half', 'movie', 'fine', 'storyline', 'second', 'half', 'movie', 'garbled']",Dying Young VHS
