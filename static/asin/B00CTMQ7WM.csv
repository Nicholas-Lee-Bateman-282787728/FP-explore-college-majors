It transports one from the depths and heights of one's emotions. It is a human story of the power of a relationship and how it can be brought down by circumstances outside one's control. It is the story of love. Love that can lead to soaring heights and tragic depths. I cannot recommend this movie enough. It is not a feel good movie however. It is a movie about the truth that occurs in people's lives.

1650758,ANCOMAI0I7LVG,B00CTMQ7WM,Andrew Ellington,"[1, 2]","I&#8217;ve spoken a lot here (and elsewhere) about how there are few things that touch me deeper than the love of or for a child.  Being a parent, I can&#8217;t help but feel a very strong connection to stories about that love, whether those stories are told on the printed page, through song or on celluloid.  It&#8217;s a visceral reaction.  I can&#8217;t restrain myself.  I just get it.A few years ago a certain film came out of nowhere and really took me for a loop.  That film was &#8216;Declaration of War&#8217;.  Equal parts artistic and stylized and gritty and earnest, that film was about as complete a tail as one could get.  Chronicling the effect that illness has on two parents as they struggle to find answers and reach a happy ending, the film literally (and figuratively) took my breath away.  Thankfully, Valerie Donzelli (who wrote, directed and starred in the film inspired by her own personal experience with her young son) knew how to cut all the realism with a honest humor that made the film not only impactful emotionally but an easy watch.  Despite the obvious sadness that permeated the core themes, the film was such an easy watch.When I heard a friend liken &#8216;The Broken Circle Breakdown&#8217; to the aforementioned masterpiece, I was heavily intrigued.&#8216;The Broken Circle Breakdown&#8217; tells the story of Elise and Didier, two drastically different individuals who fall deeply and dangerously in love.  The film breaks down the timeline of their relationship (portraying it in fractured vignettes) and shows their love sparking, blossoming and then consuming itself in a violent (figurative) climax when their young daughter is diagnosed (and subsequently overtaken) with cancer.  In the wake of this tragedy, their relationship and, more notably, their beliefs are brought to a boil, especially when Didier&#8217;s staunch atheism begins to corrode their relationship, especially since Elise is firmly religious.For me &#8216;The Broken Circle Breakdown&#8217; presents us with a very intriguing and thought provoking narrative, but its grasp exceeds its reach in many instances, and the finale feels like a cop out of sorts; a lazy attempt to wrap up all the film&#8217;s themes without really coloring anything in.  Being a very religious man, I&#8217;ve often found solace in the idea of faith, hope and belief.  While staring down any hardship or tragedy, there is a layer of hope that comes from my personal beliefs that help me to get through those moments, those segments in life.  I&#8217;ve had many conversations with my wife about the beauty of faith in our lives, because I can&#8217;t imagine the internal torment I&#8217;d feel if I had none.  What &#8216;The Broken Circle Breakdown&#8217; had the opportunity to deliver to us was a balanced look at both sides of the spectrum; the dealing of grief by those with and without faith.  Instead, we get a lot of screaming and crying and blurred lines (or no lines at all) and a finale that feels incredibly forced and dishonest to the conversation that the film seemed like it was attempting to start.I&#8217;m all for the dissection of faith, the lack thereof and the impending force that is doubt, but find ways to shade it and not just throw it at the audience and expect us to be moved by it or even begin to understand the point you&#8217;re trying to make.I also did not feel that the narrative structure of the film helped at all.  Telling the story in such fragmented pieces was a distraction.  Having a scene of their daughter&#8217;s sickness bleed into the moment they met bleed into Elise&#8217;s pregnancy bleed into their blaming one another for the loss of their daughter bleed into the time Didier proposed bleed into Elise being rushed to the hospital isn&#8217;t clever, it&#8217;s messy.  I&#8217;m all for stylistic narratives, but have it serve a purpose.This just all felt haphazard.Yes, it hits you emotionally and it does raise some sound arguments (although the Elise&#8217;s religiousness is mostly kept ignorant until the very end, where it feels like an easy way out).  I honestly had to turn the movie off last night because I couldn&#8217;t emotionally handle it (laying on the couch at near-midnight with my three year old daughter, who is nursing the flu, is not the ideal time to watch a child&#8217;s casket being lowered into the ground) but after finishing the film this morning it became obvious to me that emotional attachment to the themes was not enough to make this a good film.  I expected more depth out of this film, to be honest, but instead of getting inside Didier&#8217;s head all we saw was him vent and instead of underlining what exactly it was that Elise believed, all we did was see her cry and so the supposed ideals that this film claims to (or flirts with) exposing are merely left there hanging.Why speak of them if you&#8217;re ashamed of fleshing them out?",3,It

1650789,A3EHIGO4FNILXP,B00CTMQ7WM,.fgd,"[0, 0]","It is a film with an atheist bent which is refreshing. It is mostly about the agony of losing a young child to a terminal disease. It could have sublimated into Only God's Will and skimmed past as a tear-jerker but it is much deeper than that. The blue-grass music buoys up the film in a way that transcends its tragedy and there is even a little blue-grass history lesson given by the father who is a devoted disciple of such an american invention in the Appalacians. The film is a wonderful assertion of what real music is, should be and always was before corporations soul-less-ly ook over the music buisness in the west since the 1980's. Real music has the power to transcend hardship and tragedy and come out the other end exhilarated. Other examples include gospel and flamenco. Of course the opposite of blue-grass is the dire cheapness of country music leaking out of a car radio.Meanwhile be in for a treat when music is in the hands of afficianados.There was much irony to do with the mother which made the film satisfying. It was probably unintended or presented subtly; I could not tell. The dilemma here is a musician who just wanted a serious relationship with a beautiful young woman, not particularly a kid too. Tattoos aside and apparently a cool chick, I found her hyper-sensitive in a child-woman way that was exasperating.Likewise parenting that involves cocooning a kid in cotton wool. For instance, in many families children have 24 access to the parents' bedroom,which I find flabbergasting. The father was not allowed to intervene in this sublimation with soundness nor did he really want to spend the time. After all, the mother sprung the pregnancy on him after 3 months with the escape-clause "" I 've always been irregular, I didnt know "". Yeah right.....It was poignant and heart-wrenching to see the little girl suffer more as a result because she wasn't a true daddy's girl. Not to say he lacked empathy and involvement but seemed to be sitting on the side-lines waiting for his daughter to grow up before he could be close to her on his terms. Meanwhile the mother seemed to feeding off the spiritual sensitivity of children through her daughter that amounted to obsessive navel-gazing, emotional hair-splitting and the like. A common mistake in the west. Once a child knows they are loved unconditionally it's suprising how resiliant they can be. So instead of being able to poke a dead animal full of maggots with a stick and be mock-horrified,  the daughter is unprepared for when a bird dies smashing into the glass veranda. Obviously she is distressed because the bird is a poignant symbol or her own demise but defenceless due to her mother's cosseting. One could take it further and say the glass was an analogy for sublimation in God. There are many levels to view this film on whatever your beliefs since the screen-play is as sound as the music. I loved the ending when the atheist father conceded to agnoticism in respect to his wife's agonising search for accountability. Then transcended even that with an accountability for the human condition  through real music as it's supposed to be played and heard. WonderfulAn after-thought. I admired how the film ventured to approach the subject of the astral bodyof which very little is written of except in flagrant axioms by yogis ;flying astral projection and the like. Possibly it is why people keep seeing ghosts especially of the recently departed and continues to flummox surgeons how their patients, for example, can report observing their surgeon's OSD ritual prior to surgery on the operating table. In the film, the mother pads around the hospital ward like a ghost while under a coma. It raises the question of does it prove an after-life or is it humbug or is there so much more yet to understand about of the non-physical quantum workings of the cosmos? Meanwhile on the boundaries of science, the deeper they analyse the properties of the atom, the more evidence exists that matter is energy and only that and visa-versa. Mankind has always known it no matter with religious dogma or not or whatever Steven Hawkings disclaims. It'is all "" vibrations"" and musical ones are tangible to the subtle world or our subtle bodies.

However, others wrote about the beautiful bluegrass music and raw acting, and that is what won out in the end for me.Subtitles don't bother me.  I didn't find them a pain or to interfere with the movie experience at all.  If anything, it enhanced it; hearing grief expressed in a different language lends a different feel to it all, but at its core, the pain is the same no matter what language is being spoken.The acting in this movie is superb.  The storyline is both wonderful and heart-wrenching at the same time.  This movie reminded me of the lyrics to Garth Brooks' song &#34;The Dance&#34; because it brought up an interesting question: would you go through it all again if you knew what pain it would bring in the end?A few reviewers have fixated on the anti-religious vibe of some of the scenes, but I didn't seem to take it that personally, and that's coming from someone who usually votes republican. The bluegrass singer LOVES America; he states it very emphatically in the beginning of the film.  He loves bluegrass and sings the songs in English.  I think the &#34;rants&#34; that the bluegrass singer delivers has origins in his grief.  His daughter needed a treatment that wasn't perfected yet in his country, yet he sees President Bush rejecting it on moral grounds alone.  No matter what your political or religious stance is, if you lost a child that needed a certain treatment, chances are you would highly resent anyone standing in the way of that treatment.  This is not a political statement -- not at all.  Even though I've never lost a child, I could identify with Didier's grief and anger after he saw Pres. Bush give that speech.  Didier was not terribly religious, so of course he'd be outraged that treatment his daughter was relying on was being rejected on moral/religious grounds.  Who wouldn't feel this way?This movie captures these parents' grief in a very real way.  I think most parents wonder how they'd handle the grief if something like this ever happened to them.  I know I have.  I don't know if I'd be strong enough to put my life back together again, so I as a viewer totally identified with Elise's plight of desperately trying to find solid ground again.

I must admit from the very beginning I was short of breath, and saying &#8216;oh no, no, no&#8217;However, there has to be some leaven to get the viewer through this and this Belgian film, directed by Felix van Groeningen,  manages its leaven spectacularly, both in filmic, narrative terms and the excellence of the 3 leads.Elise (Veerle Baetens) is a quirky young woman who owns a tattoo parlour. She meets Didier (Johan Heldenberg, who also co-wrote the script) a blue-grass musician in love with America and its country music. The wonderful, intricate music runs through the film, as the band achieves greater success and scenes take in concerts from little smoky dives to larger stadiums.The structure of the film (and it works stunningly) is non-linear, as over 7 years of relationship cuts between different moments of past and present. The audience is pretty well in the know of &#8216;what happens next&#8217; all the way through, so what we focus on is the how and the internal psychology of the individuals. Intercut with this is the friction between faith (Elise) and atheism (Didier) and the wider way in which politics, medical research and individual lives collide.Baetens and Heldenberg offer beautifully raw, real performances, and are un-airbrushed and unsentimental.However &#8211; I mentioned 3 leads &#8211; little Nell Cattrysse as Maybelle, Elise and Didier&#8217;s daughter, will not so much break your heart as rip it in pieces.No doubt this review is screaming at the more sensitive &#8211; avoid, avoid, but, there is real joy and sweetness within it, and the savour and fizz of life, the upsides as well as the downs, are engaged with. The non-linear narrative inserts slivers of the very very good and the very very painful cheek by jowl with each other.

1650834,A99NZX4ACZXF3,B00CTMQ7WM,Mack E. Tan,"[76, 91]","The director takes a common story--two unconventional people fall in love, then are tested by tragedy--and rejuvenates it mostly by incorporating some of the best bluegrass music I've ever heard.  And bluegrass is not even my favorite genre of music but in this film, it is truly divine.  The first time I watched this film, I did so for the story.  The second time, it was more because I wanted to hear the music again.Apart from the music, the story works because of the two leads who are absolutely brilliant in their roles as Didier, a Belgian bluegrass musician in love with the idea of America, and Elise, a beautiful--and beautifully tattooed--tattoo artist and free spirit.  They meet, fall in love, and Elise becomes the lead singer in Didier's bluegrass band.  Once she's added to the band, they grow in popularity becoming quite successful.  They have a child and then a tragedy begins to tear their lives apart.What I appreciated about the film: 1. Unlike Hollywood, the actors look like real people, teeth and all.  I enjoy watching a film where the people don't look manufactured to perfection, where they look authentic.  2. The simple story delivers an unexpected double whammy & reminds us that our lives can change completely in an instant through no fault of our own. 3. The music is indeed divine and organically handled.In addition, I particularly enjoyed the tongue-lashing Didier unloads on George Bush.

1650853,A14GK0E64J0WAS,B00CTMQ7WM,Paul Allaer,"[22, 28]","""The Broken Circle Breakdown"" (2012 release from Belgium; 111 min.) brings the story of a young couple in Flanders (the Dutch-speaking part of Belgium), Didier and Elise, and how they are coping with the potentially fatal illness that has befallen their 6 year old daughter Maybelle. As the movie opens, we witness a bluegrass band in performance. Turns out that Didier has taken up the banjo and just loves all things American, and in particular Bill Monroe, ""the father of bluegrass"", he reminds us. After the opening credits, the movie immediately takes us into the hospital where Maybelle is being treated for cancer, and right a way you can tell this is going to be a heavy movie. As Didier is trying to keep his composure, Else shushes ""we do our crying at home, here we are positive!"". The movie then jumps back 7 year, to 1999, when Didier and Elise (who owns a tattoo parlor and features a number of large tattoos all over her body) first meet. From there on, the movie jumps back and forth between past, present and even future. To tell you more would ruin your viewing experience, you'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.Several comments: first and foremost, this is an emotionally devastating movie, and not one for the faint of heart on top of that. Indeed, emotions are displayed raw and unfiltered, sometimes uncomfortably so. Second, the script manages to beautifully interweave the bluegrass theme (providing a much needed emotional outlet, both for the characters and for us, the viewer) with the family drama itself. Third, the lead performances from Johan Heldenbergh (as Didier; he also co-wrote the script), but even more so Veerle Baetens as Elise will simply blow you away. Baetens displays a vulnerability as the hurting wife and mother that surely will tuck at your heart. She has already won a number of awards in Europe for this performance, and may win yet more. No surprise, this film is the official entry from Belgium for the 2014 Best Foreign Film Oscar. Last but certainly not least, the music does play an important role in the film. I was amazed how well the bluegrass band performs. The original soundtrack is available here on Amazon for anyone interested.This movie was a runaway success in Belgium and also scored very nicely in a number of other markets. I don't see this happening in the US, as the movie is frankly too downbeat. Nobody watching this is going to walk away thinking ""well, that was a jolly good time!"", but that doesn't mean this movie isn't worth your attention. If you are in the mood for an emotionally taxing viewing experience, I can assure you that you will be rewarded.

We meet Didier and Elise they sort of fall for each other at first sight. He invites her to come see his band, who are a Bluegrass outfit and to say they are excellent is a massive understatement.They move to his cowboy house and start a truly moving love affair which sees her getting pregnant and joining the band who sing American music like they were born to it. Then tragedy strikes and their daughter is diagnosed with cancer. The band have become part of the fabric of all three of the family's lives and as the pressure builds so everything they have in life and love gets called into question. The story is told in a non linear narrative in that it jumps around from time frame to time frame. Each time it does this a little more of the story is revealed - slowly building the full picture. The music is the glue that links the scenes as are the tattoos that Elise's gets done as a permanent reminder of her life and loves for all to see.To cal this excellent is only half the story; apart from being moving, beautifully acted and filmed it also tells a story with a purpose that includes the lack of stem cell research and the hopelessness that is brought about by a parents worse fear. It unfolds in such a way that you would begrudge missing a single second. It is in Flemish and English with very good sub titles and is probably one of the most moving films I have seen this year - I can only absolutely recommend this wonderful film.",5,"Flemish Tale of Love, Loss and Bluegrass that is astounding.",1387756800,"12 23, 2013",2013,1629,"['Please', 'Note', 'people', 'consider', 'review', 'contain', 'spoilers', 'official', 'Belgian', 'entry', '2014', 'Oscars', 'best', 'foreign', 'language', 'film', 'seeing', 'can', 'see', 'why', 'meet', 'Didier', 'Elise', 'sort', 'fall', 'other', 'first', 'sight', 'come', 'see', 'band', 'who', 'are', 'Bluegrass', 'outfit', 'say', 'are', 'excellent', 'massive', 'understatement.They', 'move', 'cowboy', 'house', 'start', 'truly', 'moving', 'love', 'affair', 'getting', 'pregnant', 'joining', 'band', 'who', 'sing', 'American', 'music', 'were', 'born', 'Then', 'tragedy', 'strikes', 'daughter', 'diagnosed', 'cancer', 'band', 'have', 'become', 'part', 'fabric', 'three', 'family', 'lives', 'pressure', 'so', 'everything', 'have', 'life', 'love', 'called', 'question', 'story', 'told', 'non', 'linear', 'narrative', 'time', 'frame', 'time', 'frame', 'time', 'little', 'more', 'story', 'revealed', 'slowly', 'building', 'full', 'picture', 'music', 'glue', 'scenes', 'are', 'tattoos', 'Elise', 'done', 'permanent', 'reminder', 'life', 'loves', 'see.To', 'cal', 'excellent', 'only', 'story', 'apart', 'being', 'moving', 'beautifully', 'acted', 'filmed', 'also', 'story', 'purpose', 'lack', 'stem', 'cell', 'research', 'hopelessness', 'brought', 'about', 'parents', 'worse', 'fear', 'such', 'way', 'would', 'begrudge', 'missing', 'single', 'second', 'Flemish', 'English', 'very', 'good', 'sub', 'titles', 'probably', 'one', 'most', 'moving', 'films', 'have', 'seen', 'year', 'can', 'only', 'absolutely', 'recommend', 'wonderful', 'film']",Broken Circle Breakdown

Even the haters of the film would admit that. Based on a stage play &#8211; but hardly &#8220;stagy&#8221; &#8211; the Belgian drama is received with loud acclaim, nominated for Oscar (Best Foreign Language Film) and holding an 80 percent positive rating according to the Rottentomatoes site. And I think it is overrated.It is basically a love story of a musician Didier and a tattoo artist Elise. They fall in love with each other and have a child, but one tragic event awaits the couple. The story itself is nothing new, but told in a different way. Using flashbacks over and over again (a la &#8220;Blue Valentine&#8221;), director Felix van Groeningen focuses the raw emotions of the characters &#8211; mainly joy and despair &#8230; much despair &#8211; which in turn attempt to make us emotional, too.And he is very good at that. There is a sick young girl. Wonderful bluegrass music, too. Who can resist? I read someone saying this is an emotional roller coaster. It is. The film never stops, going back and forth in time, going from one extreme to the other. Let yourself carried away by the flow, and you will enjoy the ride.But sorry, somehow I found the film&#8217;s emotions overdone, to the point of being false, despite the great music and strong acting.
