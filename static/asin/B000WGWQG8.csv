1109348,A1BLVYSYH7R272,B000WGWQG8,A&D,"[1, 2]","I saw this first time in Europe last year. I loved the way the real life was described: the illnesses like the smallpox, and their treatment, how they carried on their daily life  under the pressure of Englishmen and the higher taxation, how they made the decision to appeal to the king of England to have less taxes leading to denial and then eventually to the war. The hard choices were made, thus, making some people angry even if there really was no other choices to make.The politicians at the time learned by doing their work, like Washington, Adams, and Jefferson, how to be politicians, and what is best for the country at the time, even if it does not always please everyone or even their former allies.Sometimes you need to cooperate with your former enemy and ruler in order to save your country and continue to be prosperous.The actors were also believable in their roles as John Adams and his wife, Jefferson and Bejamin Franklin. The French court was described quite accurately with their desire of beauty, fashion, and novelty... except perhaps not enough of the lack of cleanliness, and how they actually suffered of lices, did not wash themselves so often, and the children often died early because of not being so clean. In Versailles, it was actually a custom for the visitors to pee in the corners, and they sometimes kept medallion chain with a smelly grease around their necks to collect the bugs, like lices, in them. As they did not wash themselves so often, they hid the smell, the dirt, and the grease under the wigs and powder. Powdered wigs were popular during the Louis Quatorze (Ludvig IV, the Sun King) time.Versailles palace was, and still is, a luxurious place with hundreds of rooms as described in this miniseries. The palace garden is still famous and you will recognize it once you see it because it is unique. The palace is nowadays open for visitors, and even if you won't be able to see all the rooms, you will see how glorious it must have been in 1600-1700.When Adams and Franklin served as ambassadors in France, looking for financing and allies, they visited the royal court in Versailles, and played by the rules of the king of France, Louis IV.In addition, when the French Revolution started, and Washington and Adams had to make choices whose side they are and who they support, it was a hard decision as described in this series because England was a former ruler, and still a mighty enemy. The founding fathers could not risk their relationship with England.All in all, the producers did a great job in describing the time of the founding fathers as it was, without sugarcoding the actual conditions and people.",5,The miniseries of John Adams,1308009600,"06 14, 2011",2011,2660,"['saw', 'first', 'time', 'Europe', 'last', 'year', 'loved', 'way', 'real', 'life', 'was', 'described', 'illnesses', 'smallpox', 'treatment', 'how', 'carried', 'daily', 'life', 'pressure', 'Englishmen', 'higher', 'taxation', 'how', 'made', 'decision', 'appeal', 'king', 'England', 'have', 'less', 'taxes', 'leading', 'denial', 'then', 'eventually', 'war', 'hard', 'choices', 'were', 'made', 'thus', 'making', 'people', 'angry', 'even', 'really', 'was', 'other', 'choices', 'make.The', 'politicians', 'time', 'learned', 'doing', 'work', 'Washington', 'Adams', 'Jefferson', 'how', 'be', 'politicians', 'what', 'best', 'country', 'time', 'even', 'not', 'always', 'please', 'everyone', 'even', 'former', 'allies.Sometimes', 'need', 'cooperate', 'former', 'enemy', 'ruler', 'order', 'save', 'country', 'continue', 'be', 'prosperous.The', 'actors', 'were', 'also', 'believable', 'roles', 'John', 'Adams', 'wife', 'Jefferson', 'Bejamin', 'Franklin', 'French', 'court', 'was', 'described', 'quite', 'accurately', 'desire', 'beauty', 'fashion', 'novelty', 'perhaps', 'not', 'enough', 'lack', 'cleanliness', 'how', 'actually', 'suffered', 'lices', 'did', 'not', 'wash', 'so', 'often', 'children', 'often', 'died', 'early', 'not', 'being', 'so', 'clean', 'Versailles', 'was', 'actually', 'custom', 'visitors', 'pee', 'corners', 'sometimes', 'kept', 'medallion', 'chain', 'smelly', 'grease', 'necks', 'collect', 'bugs', 'lices', 'did', 'not', 'wash', 'so', 'often', 'hid', 'smell', 'dirt', 'grease', 'wigs', 'powder', 'Powdered', 'wigs', 'were', 'popular', 'Louis', 'Quatorze', 'Ludvig', 'IV', 'Sun', 'King', 'palace', 'was', 'still', 'luxurious', 'place', 'hundreds', 'rooms', 'described', 'miniseries', 'palace', 'garden', 'still', 'famous', 'will', 'recognize', 'once', 'see', 'unique', 'palace', 'nowadays', 'open', 'visitors', 'even', 'wo', ""n't"", 'be', 'able', 'see', 'rooms', 'will', 'see', 'how', 'glorious', 'must', 'have', 'been', '1600-1700.When', 'Adams', 'Franklin', 'served', 'ambassadors', 'France', 'looking', 'financing', 'allies', 'visited', 'royal', 'court', 'Versailles', 'played', 'rules', 'king', 'France', 'Louis', 'IV.In', 'addition', 'when', 'French', 'Revolution', 'started', 'Washington', 'Adams', 'had', 'make', 'choices', 'side', 'are', 'who', 'support', 'was', 'hard', 'decision', 'described', 'series', 'England', 'was', 'former', 'ruler', 'still', 'mighty', 'enemy', 'founding', 'fathers', 'could', 'not', 'risk', 'relationship', 'England.All', 'producers', 'did', 'great', 'job', 'describing', 'time', 'founding', 'fathers', 'was', 'sugarcoding', 'actual', 'conditions', 'people']",John Adams

My 17-year-old daughter joined me in anxiously awaiting each installment, for which I expressly ordered HBO. I have only two minor complaints, which I will address further below.  The portrayals were superbly acted, and the entire piece contained subtlety & restraint while giving the viewer plenty to ""chew on"". Each evocative scene unfolded with nuance & earthy context, formed by realistic dialogue. There was some use of edgy cinematography, with unexpected angles and tight -often off-center- closeups, but the effect usually works well. It forces the eye onto a new detail.The conflicting emotions of this very real man can actually be supposed through these reenactments. I love that Mr McCullough's book was the basis for this adaption. His finely wrought depiction of a world turned upside down for Adams and the surrounding subjects is so realistic as to be stepped into, and this beautifully-made film does it justice. The locations and realism in living conditions are not to be missed.The two overlooked areas of this project that were somewhat distracting:It was sometimes difficult to know how much time had passed or where a scene was taking place. The aging of characters occasionally seemed inconsistent -most noticeably with the children. A simple caption introducing a location or year would have been appreciated. Still, these flaws do not prevent my rating this with 5 stars. We need more like this.While not a blockbuster-mentality offering, I do feel that a viewer who has some interest in history, visually stunning scenery, and a decent vocabulary will find this biopic riveting.

The story begins with the Boston Massacre, and goes from there, taking us through all those prime events which lead us to our nation's independence.  I felt as if I had traveled back in time and was there in person watching the events take place.  The actors, costumes, sets, etc. were so incredible it was easy to imagine being there.  As the story unfolded, and I got to ""witness"" our Continental Congress arguing over matters, it occurred to me how overlooked John Adams is in most US History classes today.  Of course, I knew of John Adams, (brilliantly portrayed by Paul Giamatti) but even as a US History buff,(and ALWAYS paying attention and learning in my history classes!) I had no idea he was so instrumental in pushing for our complete independence from Great Britian.  He was also the one who nominated George Washington to be the Commander of the Continental Army.  If this movie was done with historical accuracy (and from what I could see it was) then John Adams was a passionate man, who - yes, had his faults and would push people the wrong way at times - but this country owes a lot to that man!  This is one of those series where you will walk away with a lot of gained knowledge.The actors who portray the different founding fathers, somehow captured the personalities, mannerisms, and attitudes just exactly how I would have imagined them to be.  I think the best one was the actor who played Thomas Jefferson.  He somehow managed to look like he was always listening and observing; always thinking, just like I would picture Thomas Jefferson to be.  David Morse, who played George Washington, also delivered a stellar performance, portraying Gen. Washington as if it was really him, and that's exactly how he would have been.Also, Abigail Adams, (portrayed by Laura Linney) was quite a gal!  She was certainly ahead of her times, being rather vocal about things, and was her husbands greatest confidant and advisor.  She must have been an amazing woman.I would highly recommend this movie series for anyone who loves our American history.

1109371,A1QG4TLIYZRL7L,B000WGWQG8,"Arthur Blenheim ""arthurblenheim""","[2, 4]","Okay; first off, even the first episode relies on a glaring error that likely can be attributed to David McCullough's book, seeing how this film is based on his best-selling biography on John Adams for which he received a Pulitzer Prize for his writing abilities.  Certainly it can be attributed to the culpability of the author or authors of this HBO series--not for its adaptation--for its repeating the same mistake as in McCullough's book if not having researched the premises or facts that McCullough had supposedly checked.Contrary to popular misconceptions--one obviously seconded by McCullough through this film series--the Tea Act of 1773 DID NOT impose new English taxes against the American colonies.  It instead allowed the East India Company to monopolize against Colonial tea companies with low-priced tea through a tax exemption (read: a tax break) which that corporation could turn into profits from the American colonists--take, take, take.  Parliament's interests in the Company would subjugate Americans by leaving the taxes off so that American colonists would rather buy that company's lower-cost Tea, to direct the profits taken from the low-price incentive of not paying taxes into the pockets of a failing British tea company in which English members of parliament and the Crown held stock! We were fighting against aristocracy!  Boston's Tea Party wasn't so much an American rebellion against England as it was a rebellion against inequality in the economic subjugation of the General People by Aristocracy!Taxes themselves are re-investments toward the People.  If England's people weren't going to do something about economic subjugation and inequalities, certainly America's colonies could choose to, which is why this Act is so important to U.S. History.  Sam Adams, John's cousin (the guy who plotted the Boston Tea Party), wasn't against having taxes; he was for representative taxes! Because, importing duty-free merchandise (duty-free means tax-free, i.e. like an impact tax or import tariff) would lower the price beyond that of a fair-market, local pricing.  It's an unfair competition tactic that would put American local money directly into the pockets of an already-wealthy aristocracy--an elite--a select few with notions of protecting their own aristocratic interests in a failing company, and those of no one else. Certainly it would draw funds out of the American people's market.  Such tactics prevent the many who work for success to obtain it, and the few who should fail to not fail, because those few have control of the Law.  It's unfair.  The Patriots knew England's parliament held private interests conflicting with those of the [general] People.I would let this movie's pretense go, but I get sick of people getting it wrong.  The notion that McCullough's book is supposedly so popular as an accurate word on the life of John Adams yet gets this as wrong as everybody else deserves a reflection to any opinion of it.  This is just out of the courtesy to respecting the reality of American idealism--what we hoped to obtain in declaring open revolt against England.  Doesn't McCullough know what we were revolting against?Oddly, McCullough gives ample detail to show how John Adams and America's United States began with a conservative approach because of the country's youth and instability following its revolution, as his doing so doesn't seem particularly conservative in the same way of today's conservative movement.  Real conservatism isn't necessarily bad.  Much of today's ""liberals"" are similarly conservative and less anxious to get involved in a war in the same way John Adams is depicted in this series during France's war with England.  A credit to the progress of the film's story is Adams' transformation from a person who talks all the time to a man who, once the new country begins, talks less and does more thinking, especially in the episode in which he becomes the Second President in succeeding G. Washington who relied on A. Hamilton, though I am unsure to the accuracy of the depiction; however and interestingly, the film is and should be taken from Adams' perspective, so some historical mis-data is arguably acceptable, because we are not accounting for history in any more than the perspective of Adams which, if it paints others in bias, certainly it may be the bias of Adams, because it is HIS biography.  But, that admission doesn't excuse the common mistake painting so deliberate an error as the presumption that the Tea Party was against having to pay tax, or even to pay it to England, when the Tea Party was the opposite.  These authors presume that fact rather than get it from Adams!  It was about going against the corruption of aristocratic greed and this biography is more about his life than that of the country, meaning there is some need to regard reality over the presumption of telling only Adams' story, even when it IS based on HIS biography, despite the poetic story-telling in this well-made series.  All of McCullough's observations of Adams could be written to feel nearly the same and still have gotten the information more accurate in its portrayal of politics at that time, and if it had, there would have been no loss in describing Adams MORE faithfully, in a MORE proper context, within the current mellow-dramatic composition of what was already in this film; it would've been even better if it had gotten that part right!That McCullough is a historical story-teller who gets some of its history wrong, because he doesn't want to bore people by being a historian, means people reading and watching the biography won't question this misinformation while much of the normal misinformation IS corrected.  Why didn't he correct this?  Is the only context in which people remember that the Tea Party supported taxes to be in a strict documentary with a narration and a host like the Biography Show of the Arts and Entertainment Channel or one of P.B.S.?  Certainly this dramatic interpretation follows without noting an important pretense, and for no reason!  There is nothing of more historical importance than that Adams helped birth the U.S. to detach its land's people from the specific corruption of aristocratic greed!  Watching the miniseries, those American lifestyles that McCullough didn't seem to understand was very much for the reason of which he isn't conscious in his depiction of it!  Certainly I doubt that Adams' conservatism merely stopped at the fact that the country was in its infancy still, for nobody in the U.S. in the first twenty years was particularly wealthy like the wealthy of today's corporate environment.  That the country was brittle doesn't go against American themes on equality which is the reason we were in open revolt.  There's no blatant evidence within this film that the youthful brittleness resulted directly from an economic problem, or, if it were, that it wasn't created as part of the equality it sought in revolting; or in anything else--it never explains why Adams thought it was brittle or promotes any descriptive thesis: it just kind-of throws it out there without explanation.",4,"Good, but

1109372,A26FPHC71C5IX3,B000WGWQG8,Aryael de Kaprii,"[1, 1]","I got hung up on the fight that had been taking place between the numerous 1 star reviewers.  They were going back and fourth debating the accuracy of this HBO mini-series. As is often the case with these Amazon reviews, the conversations get heated and quickly turn into personal jabs. It is a shame that too much knowledge of a certain subject can rob a person of the sheer enjoyment when that subject is presented on film. Oh Well, I am not a History Teacher, nor am I a Professor of any kind. I did not major in History in college, and what few classes I had to take, I memorized what I could for the exams and forgot the rest. Most of my college history courses were in Western History (Ancient Greek and Rome). I very much enjoyed this HBO mini-series. I just finished watching it today. I found it on a shelf in my mother's house and took an interest and I am so glad that I did. I found it to be very entertaining. I never read the book, on which this series is based, and so I cannot claim to be expert of its factuality or accuracy, however I was moved by this depiction of a man's self sacrifice for the creation and building of this great nation. I never considered the early, EARLY, developemental stages of the United States and thus this series really opened my eyes and forced me to regret -on some level- my own selfishness as a teenager in not focusing on my studies with the intention of giving my mind to the cause of the further development of my country. Although I did go to college, and manage to make Dean's a couple of times before graduating, this film really made me feel guilty about not doing more for America. Seeing how hard these men worked for this country and how rapidly we in these contemporary times are destroying it, I couldnt help but feel some sorrow for Adams. This was a man who had a respect for the law and for the Republic and for Independance -it made me sick, and at times nearly brought me to tears, when I think about the vast majority of this nation's inhabitants who have no respect for the Declaration of Independance and the Constitution of the United States.  It took such effort and such sacrifice for those two great documents to come into being. Well, getting off my soap box -I noticed some reviewers had a problem with the accuracy of the depiction of Adam's character. Again, having not read the book, I am in no position to argue the case, but I can say that I personally did not find this character to be unlikeable in anyway. I saw this character as a man who was trying to build a nation and free himself and his fellow man from the bonds of a strangling yet neglectful monarchy. I would think that one would have to be tough as stone and just as cold to make one's case and fight the good fight. If anything I found Jefferson's character to be too standoffish and not passionate nor active enough in the fight -this may not be historically accurate, but that was the impression I got from this series. In addition Franklin was presented as just plain decadent, indulgent and silly. Some people disliked Abigail's depiction and again I would have to disagree. I loved how she was strong willed, opinionated and yet refined and decent. She watched out for her man and stood by -as a spouse should -and watched her husband's faults. She was there to perfect her husband for his duty, whether or not she succeeded, she was a fantastic support and I loved her character. It was sweet and powerful when she passed away. She was such a force in Adam's life -according to the series. Finally, I noticed in the fight among the 1 star group that some disliked the scene where the man was tar and feathered. I found this scene to be very powerful and necessary for the drama -whether historically accurate, I do not know, but the series is for entertainment. The exposure and victimization of the gentleman really expressed the rage of the people and how they were fed up with the treatment by, and sheer arrogance of, the English Monarchy.

1109373,AFYYHRPSFBLWS,B000WGWQG8,Ash Ryan,"[4, 7]","I was anticipating this series as something inspirational and informative of American history.  I was hugely disappointed.  Only the second of the seven episodes came close to meeting my expectations---I would probably rate it four stars.  Episodes 1, 3, 6, and 7 were mixed, with some good elements and some bad, while episodes 4 and 5 were awful.Historically, it's for the most part more or less in the ballpark.  However, there are many details that have to be included in a movie like this that simply are not knowable from the historical record---much of the dialogue, a given person's demeanor at a particular time, etc., are of necessity a matter of interpretation for the filmmakers, and they have invariably chosen to present the facts in the worst possible way.Part of the problem is the acting.  Giamatti's interpretation of Adams as basically an insecure and petulant child driven by his emotions who flies into violent rages at the slightest provocation is extremely irritating.  Jefferson is portrayed from the beginning as strangely aloof.  After the death of his wife, this detachment becomes morbidly morose for the rest of the series---it's like something out of Interview With the Vampire.The filmmakers seem to be doing their best to present the American Founders and Adams in particular as vain, pompous, mean, petty, and mundane.  There are scenes of Adams preparing manure, brushing his teeth, shingling his roof, and so on.  There is nothing wrong with historical accuracy, of course, or painting a picture of what life was like in the 18th century so long as it's well-integrated into the main story---but there is something very wrong with anyone who would pay $50 to watch John Adams brushing his teeth, not to mention with filmmakers who couldn't think of anything more significant or important to do with the time devoted to that scene.Aesthetically, the series is mixed.  The costumes, sets, etc. are excellent---but the cinematography is almost bizarre in places.  There are many shots at extreme tilted angles or wobbling, for no apparent reason---shots that would fit right in in a Hitchcock picture, but this is a biopic of John Adams, for crying out loud!  More than once a shot is framed with the actor to the far side of the screen, with three-quarters of the frame practically empty---again, for no good reason.  It's as though it was being shot by a student filmmaker who was trying too hard to be ""artsy,"" and this imposition of post-modern aesthetic sensibilities onto early modern subject matter is distractingly out of place.The overall tone of the series is extremely negative.  The filmmakers seem determined to undercut any of Adams' positive achievements.  The episode in which he wins the election to become the second president ends with a shot of him sitting dejectedly in a corner of the presidential mansion, which has been looted by servants after Washington's departure; the episode in which he manages to avert war with France ends with the death of his alcoholic son; and so on.In short, HBO's ""John Adams"" is manifestly unjust to its subject.  It's also highly overrated.  I have not read the book upon which this series was supposedly based, though I have read several other of David McCullough's books and for the most part enjoyed them.  Like most contemporary popular historians and biographers, he injects his personal bias into the material, though he is not as bad as many others in this regard even if he does somehow manage to slant in every direction at once.  Still, I doubt that the filmmakers' treatment of the material can be attributed to the author.  Don't waste your money on this movie---at most, get it from the library and watch the first two or three episodes, and skip the rest---without having read it, I'd make an educated guess that the book has to be a better bet for your money.",3,A big disappointment,1230076800,"12 24, 2008",2008,3862,"['was', 'anticipating', 'series', 'something', 'inspirational', 'informative', 'American', 'history', 'was', 'hugely', 'disappointed', 'Only', 'second', 'seven', 'episodes', 'came', 'close', 'meeting', 'expectations', '-I', 'would', 'probably', 'rate', 'four', 'stars', 'Episodes', '1', '3', '6', '7', 'were', 'mixed', 'good', 'elements', 'bad', 'episodes', '4', '5', 'were', 'awful.Historically', 'most', 'part', 'more', 'less', 'ballpark', 'However', 'are', 'many', 'details', 'have', 'be', 'included', 'movie', 'simply', 'are', 'not', 'knowable', 'historical', 'record', '-much', 'dialogue', 'given', 'person', 'demeanor', 'particular', 'time', 'etc.', 'are', 'necessity', 'matter', 'interpretation', 'filmmakers', 'have', 'invariably', 'chosen', 'present', 'facts', 'worst', 'possible', 'way.Part', 'problem', 'acting', 'Giamatti', 'interpretation', 'Adams', 'basically', 'insecure', 'petulant', 'child', 'driven', 'emotions', 'who', 'violent', 'rages', 'slightest', 'provocation', 'extremely', 'irritating', 'Jefferson', 'portrayed', 'beginning', 'strangely', 'aloof', 'death', 'wife', 'detachment', 'morbidly', 'morose', 'rest', 'series', '-it', 'something', 'Interview', 'Vampire.The', 'filmmakers', 'seem', 'be', 'doing', 'best', 'present', 'American', 'Founders', 'Adams', 'particular', 'vain', 'pompous', 'mean', 'petty', 'mundane', 'are', 'scenes', 'Adams', 'preparing', 'manure', 'brushing', 'teeth', 'shingling', 'roof', 'so', 'nothing', 'wrong', 'historical', 'accuracy', 'course', 'painting', 'picture', 'what', 'life', 'was', '18th', 'century', 'so', 'long', 'well-integrated', 'main', 'story', '-but', 'something', 'very', 'wrong', 'anyone', 'who', 'would', 'pay', '50', 'watch', 'John', 'Adams', 'brushing', 'teeth', 'not', 'mention', 'filmmakers', 'who', 'could', ""n't"", 'think', 'anything', 'more', 'significant', 'important', 'do', 'time', 'devoted', 'scene.Aesthetically', 'series', 'mixed', 'costumes', 'sets', 'etc', 'are', 'excellent', 'cinematography', 'almost', 'bizarre', 'places', 'are', 'many', 'shots', 'extreme', 'tilted', 'angles', 'wobbling', 'apparent', 'reason', '-shots', 'would', 'fit', 'right', 'Hitchcock', 'picture', 'biopic', 'John', 'Adams', 'crying', 'out', 'loud', 'More', 'once', 'shot', 'framed', 'actor', 'far', 'side', 'screen', 'three-quarters', 'frame', 'practically', 'empty', '-again', 'good', 'reason', 'was', 'being', 'shot', 'student', 'filmmaker', 'who', 'was', 'trying', 'too', 'hard', 'be', 'artsy', 'imposition', 'post-modern', 'aesthetic', 'sensibilities', 'early', 'modern', 'subject', 'matter', 'distractingly', 'place.The', 'overall', 'tone', 'series', 'extremely', 'negative', 'filmmakers', 'seem', 'determined', 'undercut', 'Adams', 'positive', 'achievements', 'episode', 'election', 'become', 'second', 'president', 'shot', 'sitting', 'dejectedly', 'corner', 'presidential', 'mansion', 'been', 'looted', 'servants', 'Washington', 'departure', 'episode', 'avert', 'war', 'France', 'death', 'alcoholic', 'son', 'so', 'on.In', 'short', 'HBO', 'John', 'Adams', 'manifestly', 'unjust', 'subject', 'also', 'highly', 'overrated', 'have', 'not', 'read', 'book', 'series', 'was', 'supposedly', 'based', 'have', 'read', 'several', 'other', 'David', 'McCullough', 'books', 'most', 'part', 'enjoyed', 'most', 'contemporary', 'popular', 'historians', 'biographers', 'personal', 'bias', 'material', 'not', 'as', 'bad', 'many', 'others', 'regard', 'even', 'somehow', 'manage', 'slant', 'direction', 'once', 'Still', 'doubt', 'filmmakers', 'treatment', 'material', 'can', 'be', 'attributed', 'author', 'Do', ""n't"", 'waste', 'money', 'movie', 'most', 'get', 'library', 'watch', 'first', 'two', 'three', 'episodes', 'skip', 'rest', 'having', 'read', ""'d"", 'make', 'educated', 'guess', 'book', 'be', 'better', 'bet', 'money']",John Adams

1109376,A1CQGAPQMN41LV,B000WGWQG8,"A. Whitehead ""Werthead""","[1, 2]","Boston, 1770. John Adams is a successful lawyer who finds himself caught in a difficult position when he is asked to defend British soldiers accused of killing several civilians during a 'peaceful protest'. Since the protest was against Britain's increasing taxation of the colony whilst refusing it representation, the situation is inflammatory. Adams' sterling defence earns him a job offer from the colony's governor, which he turns down as King George III's policies towards the colonies become more repressive over the following few years. Adams is asked to help represent Massachusetts at the Continental Congress in Pennsylvania, where the debate quickly becomes centered on the question of full secession of the Thirteen Colonies from British control. With pro-British sentiment strong amongst some of the delegates, it falls to Adams and several unlikely allies, notably Dr. Benjamin Franklin and Thomas Jefferson, to push through the secession agreement and recruit Colonel George Washington to command the state militias. On 4 July 1776 the North American colonies declare independence from the British Empire, sparking the expansion of the armed struggle into a full-scale war.Over the next fifty years, Adams continues to serve the fledgling nation. He serves as a delegate to the court of King Louis in pre-revolutionary Paris, as the United States' first peacetime ambassador to the hostile court of George III in London, as the first Vice-President of the United States and then as the second President during a time of great controversy as the country is divided over the matter of siding with Britain in war against France. Through it all Adams tries to steer a course of intellectual debate and mediation, but finds that his irascible temper and intellectual vanity makes him many and easy enemies at home and abroad. His relationship with Franklin and especially Jefferson changes over time, but he is constantly advised by his loyal and intelligent wife, Abigail, on matters personal and political.John Adams is an epic HBO mini-series. In the course of seven hour-long episodes, it charts the birth of the United States and the role Adams (Paul Giamatti) played in its formative years, culminating in his retirement and the election of his son, John Quincy Adams, as the sixth President. The events are vast, incorporating the Revolutionary War, the French Revolution and the impact of the French Revolutionary and Napoleonic wars on the USA's relations with both France and Britain (although the War of 1812 is not featured). Adams' various jobs are highlighted, from his not-so-humble beginnings as a skilled lawyer, his role in helping draft the Declaration of Independence to his tenure as Vice-President (where he becomes the first incumbent of the role to realise how powerless the position is) to his position as President, including being the first American head of state to live in the White House.Adams the politician, lawyer and peacemaker form one side of the story, but his personal life forms the other. His wife Abigail (Laura Linney) is frequently separated from her husband as his job calls him to Philadelphia for long periods and, later, takes him to Europe for several years. Abigail's role as the home-maker, the raiser of their children (whose own travails form the series' major subplots) and her husband's constant advisor, either in person or by letter, lends an important emotional context to the drama. The creators of this series are as keen on the story of Adams the man as much as the historical figure, which is vital to hold the viewer's interest over the course of seven hours.This is a talkative drama. With the exception of an engagement with a British frigate during his crossing to Paris and a later brush with illness in the Netherlands, Adams' life is not in jeopardy. The siege and battle for Boston is depicted briefly (helped by some superb CGI), but action elements are relatively light on the ground. The drama is fantastically acted by an A-grade cast acting at the top of their game and is superbly written. It is not completely historically accurate (lampshaded at one point when Adams rails against John Trumbull's famous painting, the Declaration of Independence, for being an artistic rather than literal interpretation of events) but the lengthy running time permits a much closer adherence to historical fact than say a two-hour movie would have. The only moment where the historical deviances seem incongruous is when Adams and Jefferson's strained relationship is repaired by Abigail's death and it is suggested they only have a brief period of reconciliation afterwards, whilst in reality they began corresponding six years before Abigail's passing and continued to do so until their own deaths eight years later. This feels a little too close to cheap sentiment, at odds with the deeper drama that makes up most of the mini-series.Of course, the element I suspect most viewers will think is a ludicrous dramatic convenience is actually completely true: both John Adams and Thomas Jefferson died within a few hours of one another on the 50th anniversary of the declaration of independence.The actors are superb. Paul Giamatti plays Adams as irascible, arrogant, hot-tempered and prickly, but also a loving husband and father and deeply concerned for the well-being of his country. He is not always likable, but then neither was Adams. Laura Linney, who won an Emmy for her performance, is excellent as Abigail, portraying her as a strong and resolute woman occasionally resentful of her husband's long absences but also understanding of the magnitude of the times they are living in. Tom Wilkinson is likewise brilliant as the elderly Benjamin Franklin, whilst Stephen Dillane brings gravitas and intelligence to the role of Thomas Jefferson. If HBO ever do a companion series on the life of Jefferson, they should re-recruit Dillane immediately. Less well-served is Rufus Sewell, a tremendously skilled and capable actor, who is distinctly under-used as Alexander Hamilton and not given much of a deep character portrait. In addition, Tom Hollander has an excellent cameo as King George III, but plays him as if he's almost gone mad already, although his full descent into insanity did not begin until several years later. For the most part, the casting is exemplary.John Adams (****) is an epic, rich and gripping political and character drama, marred only by some minor acting and writing choices that don't entirely work. But, hinged on the superb performances of Giamatti, Linney, Wilkinson and Dillane, it is for the most part must-see TV.",5,Another success for HBO,1254528000,"10 3, 2009",2009,6622,"['Boston', '1770',

Chaney,"[0, 0]","I just finished watching HBO miniseries ""John Adams""--based on the book by David McCullough--on DVD and I must say, I thought it was excellent.  The movie does a great job of capturing the life of John Adams and his relationships with his wife Abigail and his friend and fellow revolutionary Thomas Jefferson.  The miniseries follows Adams from the Boston Massacre to his death at his home in 1826.  It covers all of the periods of Adams' life, and the Revolutionary War period is treat with as much importance as any other period.  That being said, the previews which lead you to believe this movie is only about the Revolutionary War are a little misleading.Both Paul Giamatti and Laura Linney are great in this miniseries as the Adamses, and Stephen Dilliane is also very good as Jefferson.  I do wish this miniseries had focused a little more on the politics of early America and a little less on the family, but you can't have everything!I would recommend this movie to any fan of McCullough or to anyone interested in the Revolutionary War period.

After viewing Paul Giamatti's fabulous, more grounded portrayal, I must admit THIS is by far the best Adams you'll ever find! Proud, yet insecure, lacking the sophistication of Jefferson,  stature of Washington, or urbane wittiness of Franklin, Giamatti's Adams is occasionally coarse, frequently headstrong, but makes up, in fervor, what he lacks in tact. Unlike Daniels' 'take', he is certainly no genius (his thinly-veiled envy of Jefferson and Franklin provides some of the story's conflict, and humor), but he is an impassioned activist, a 'doer' without whom America would never have been born. The first third of the series, covering the Revolutionary War, 'reinvents' Adams for modern audiences, and is both fascinating, and quite moving.Based on David McCullough's celebrated biography, and filmed largely in eastern Europe and Williamsburg, VA, the series wonderfully captures the 'look' of the times, from untamed wilderness, to cities both old and grimy, and young and dynamic. In this tableau, rough-hewn Americans contrast sharply with coiffed Europeans, providing a nice visualization of the difference between the Old and New Worlds, and justification for the existence of a new nation. In the entertaining 'middle' segments of the production, Adams is thrust into European society, a bull in a china shop who embarrasses both Franklin (a terrific Tom Wilkinson, looking eerily like the legendary Founding Father), and later, Jefferson (Stephen Dillane, who lacks Jefferson's height and charisma, but is quite good). Despite the loyal friendship of George Washington (a dead-on, very effective David Morse), Adams proves a disastrous diplomat and Vice President, and is stymied as President by a near-fanatical fear of terrorism (shades of 9/11 and today!)Perhaps the series' finest moments come when Adams leaves office, and tries to adjust to life as a farmer and forgotten 'hero of the revolution'. Here, Laura Linney's contribution, as Abigail Adams, truly shines; a loving, feisty, politically savvy woman, she now ages gracefully as a supportive wife and heartsick mother (particularly during the illness and death of daughter 'Nabby', portrayed sensitively by Sarah Polley). Linney and Giamatti's scenes together, terrific throughout the series, are especially poignant as their lives draw to a close. Another plus in these chapters is the renewal of the Adams/Jefferson friendship, through correspondence, as two old warhorses face a changing world and mortality, together (both would die on the same day, July 4th, fifty years after the signing of the Declaration of Independence...a touch no author would dare invent, but true!)""John Adams"" is an epic achievement, and the perfect way to celebrate Independence Day, any time you pop it into your DVD player!",5,The Perfect 4th of July 'Birthday Present'!,1215129600,"07 4, 2008",2008,2969,"['viewed', 'HBO', 'Miniseries', 'John', 'Adams', 'impression', 'American', 'patriot', 'had', 'been', 'based', 'largely', 'William', 'Daniels', 'brilliant', 'preening', 'rooster', 'musical', '1776', 'viewing', 'Paul', 'Giamatti', 'fabulous', 'more', 'grounded', 'portrayal', 'must', 'admit', 'THIS', 'far', 'best', 'Adams', ""'ll"", 'ever', 'find', 'Proud', 'yet', 'insecure', 'lacking', 'sophistication', 'Jefferson', 'stature', 'Washington', 'urbane', 'wittiness', 'Franklin', 'Giamatti', 'Adams', 'occasionally', 'coarse', 'frequently', 'headstrong', 'up', 'fervor', 'what', 'tact', 'Daniels', ""'take"", 'certainly', 'genius', 'thinly-veiled', 'envy', 'Jefferson', 'Franklin', 'story', 'conflict', 'humor', 'impassioned', 'activist', ""'doer"", 'whom', 'America', 'would', 'never', 'have', 'been', 'born', 'first', 'third', 'series', 'covering', 'Revolutionary', 'War', ""'reinvents"", 'Adams', 'modern', 'audiences', 'fascinating', 'quite', 'moving.Based', 'David', 'McCullough', 'celebrated', 'biography', 'filmed', 'largely', 'eastern', 'Europe', 'Williamsburg', 'VA', 'series', 'wonderfully', ""'look"", 'times', 'untamed', 'wilderness', 'cities', 'old', 'grimy', 'young', 'dynamic', 'tableau', 'rough-hewn', 'Americans', 'contrast', 'sharply', 'coiffed', 'Europeans', 'providing', 'nice', 'visualization', 'difference', 'Old', 'New', 'Worlds', 'justification', 'existence', 'new', 'nation', 'entertaining', ""'middle"", 'segments', 'production', 'Adams', 'thrust', 'European', 'society', 'bull', 'china', 'shop', 'who', 'Franklin', 'terrific', 'Tom', 'Wilkinson', 'looking', 'eerily', 'legendary', 'Founding', 'Father', 'later', 'Jefferson', 'Stephen', 'Dillane', 'who', 'Jefferson', 'height', 'charisma', 'quite', 'good', 'loyal', 'friendship', 'George', 'Washington', 'dead-on', 'very', 'effective', 'David', 'Morse', 'Adams', 'disastrous', 'diplomat', 'Vice', 'President', 'stymied', 'President', 'near-fanatical', 'fear', 'terrorism', 'shades', '9/11', 'today', 'Perhaps', 'series', 'finest', 'moments', 'come', 'when', 'Adams', 'office', 'tries', 'adjust', 'life', 'farmer', 'forgotten', ""'hero"", 'revolution', 'Here', 'Laura', 'Linney', 'contribution', 'Abigail', 'Adams', 'truly', 'shines', 'loving', 'feisty', 'politically', 'savvy', 'woman', 'now', 'gracefully', 'supportive', 'wife', 'heartsick', 'mother', 'particularly', 'illness', 'death', 'daughter', ""'Nabby"", 'portrayed', 'sensitively', 'Sarah', 'Polley', 'Linney', 'Giamatti', 'scenes', 'together', 'terrific', 'series', 'are', 'especially', 'poignant', 'lives', 'draw', 'close', 'plus', 'chapters', 'renewal', 'Adams/Jefferson', 'friendship', 'correspondence', 'two', 'old', 'warhorses', 'face', 'changing', 'world', 'mortality', 'together', 'would', 'die', 'same', 'day', 'July', '4th', 'fifty', 'years', 'signing', 'Declaration', 'Independence', 'touch', 'author', 'would', 'dare', 'invent', 'true', 'John', 'Adams', 'epic', 'achievement', 'perfect', 'way', 'celebrate', 'Independence', 'Day', 'time', 'pop', 'DVD', 'player']",John Adams

If you do not, I shall repent in Heaven that I ever took half the pains to preserve it.""- John Adams 1777HBO did a fine job with the John Adams miniseries and took great pains to get ""most"" of the historical details correct.  It aptly showed how both John and Abigail sacrificed so much in terms of their marriage and their family to help create and foster the birth of this fine nation.  There was also somewhat of a more balanced storyline perspective as to fault: Colonists versus the British monarchy.  It also portrayed the great love that most of the colonists had for Britain and their former roots and the great reluctance that faced many of them.There are seven segments in the saga which spans from 1770 until John Adams' death in 1826.  Much of the  storyline is based upon David McCullough's exceptional book on John Adams by the same name..The seven segments are as follows:Part I: Join or Die (1770 - 1774)Part II: Independence (1774 - 1776)Part III: Don't Tread on Me (1776 - 1781)Part IV:  Reunion (1781 - 1789)Part V: Unite or Die (1789 - 1797)Part VI:  Unnecessary War (1797 - 1801)Part VII:  Peacefield (1801 - 1826)What is nice about the miniseries is that it can be divided up into manageable blocks which can be watched and discussed or debated with family and friends.  There are so many issues discussed which will sound very familiar even to us today.  To think that it took thirty six ballots to elect Thomas Jefferson because there was a tie in the number of votes for each of two candidates is absolutely amazing.  The founding fathers were willing to let elections and the nomination process take its course and they allowed a lot of discussion to take place and ""compromise"".  I have to say that there were some historical liberties taken with the miniseries but it did not detract from the story itself or the core of the story's fabric: John and Abigail Adams' life of service to their country.  In fact the entire Adams family paid a price in one way or another for this dedication and devotion without which our country may have floundered and not survived.  Adams was extremely instrumental in this country's creation, nurturing and survival.To own this series is a very wise investment especially if you are a history buff.  The starkness of the surroundings and how they were portrayed in the film seemed on target to me.  The background seemed to match the moods of the Adams themselves and what the characters had to go through to endure and not give up.Laura Linney and Paul Giamatti as the Adams couple were superb.  But I had to say that once again I was very impressed with Stephen Dillane and his portrayal.  I appreciated his rendition of  Jefferson as much as I liked Dillane in Anna Karenina (another surprise performance).Tom Wilkinson had some fine moments as Ben Franklin and David Morse was superb as George Washington.  Rufus Sewell played Alexander Hamilton and I have to say after Sewell's performance I disliked Hamilton as much as I disliked the character he played in the movie ""The Holiday"".  His performance was also spot on as the ""insensitive and manipulative"" Hamilton.What impressed me was the intimate look at the dynamics of these perilous times when our country was born.  So much could have gone wrong and did; and without great sacrifices from great men; everything could have been different.  Very different.Posterity has a lot to be grateful for.  You have to wonder whether we are capable of the sacrifices that so many had to make to preserve and keep our freedoms.  Our forefathers were made of the right stuff as were those who fought in all of our wars to protect us back home.  It just seemed to me at the conclusion of this very moving dramatization that there is a recurring theme which reminded me of a famous speech given by Winston Churchill in 1940 and the resulting poster which read: ""Never was so much owed by so many to so few.""Recommended: A-Bentley/2008John Adams (HBO Miniseries)",4,Freedom has its Price,1211932800,"05 28, 2008",2008,4085,"['Posterity', 'will', 'never', 'know', 'how', 'much', 'cost', 'preserve', 'freedom', 'hope', 'will', 'make', 'good', 'use', 'do', 'not', 'shall', 'repent', 'Heaven', 'ever', 'took', 'pains', 'preserve', 'John', 'Adams', '1777HBO', 'did', 'fine', 'job', 'John', 'Adams', 'miniseries', 'took', 'great', 'pains', 'get', 'most', 'historical', 'details', 'correct', 'aptly', 'showed', 'how', 'John', 'Abigail', 'sacrificed', 'so', 'much', 'terms', 'marriage', 'family', 'help', 'create', 'foster', 'birth', 'fine', 'nation', 'was', 'also', 'somewhat', 'more', 'balanced', 'storyline', 'perspective', 'fault', 'Colonists', 'versus', 'British', 'monarchy', 'also', 'portrayed', 'great', 'love', 'most', 'colonists', 'had', 'Britain', 'former', 'roots', 'great', 'reluctance', 'faced', 'many', 'are', 'seven', 'segments', 'saga', '1770', 'John', 'Adams', 'death', '1826', 'Much', 'storyline', 'based', 'David', 'McCullough', 'exceptional', 'book', 'John', 'Adams', 'same', 'name..The', 'seven', 'segments', 'are', 'Part', 'Join', 'Die', '1770', '1774', 'Part', 'II', 'Independence', '1774', '1776', 'Part', 'III', 'Do', ""n't"", 'Tread', 'Me', '1776', '1781', 'Part', 'IV', 'Reunion', '1781', '1789', 'Part', 'V', 'Unite', 'Die', '1789', '1797', 'Part', 'VI', 'Unnecessary', 'War', '1797', '1801', 'Part', 'VII', 'Peacefield', '1801', '1826', 'What', 'nice', 'miniseries', 'can', 'be', 'divided', 'up', 'manageable', 'blocks', 'can', 'be', 'watched', 'discussed', 'debated', 'family', 'friends', 'are', 'so', 'many', 'issues', 'discussed', 'will', 'sound', 'very', 'familiar', 'even', 'today', 'think', 'took', 'thirty', 'six', 'ballots', 'elect', 'Thomas', 'Jefferson', 'was', 'tie', 'number', 'votes', 'two', 'candidates', 'absolutely', 'amazing', 'founding', 'fathers', 'were', 'willing', 'let', 'elections', 'nomination', 'process', 'take', 'course', 'allowed', 'lot', 'discussion', 'take', 'place', 'compromise', 'have', 'say', 'were', 'historical', 'liberties', 'taken', 'miniseries', 'did', 'not', 'detract', 'story', 'core', 'story', 'fabric', 'John', 'Abigail', 'Adams', 'life', 'service', 'country', 'fact', 'entire', 'Adams', 'family', 'paid', 'price', 'one', 'way', 'dedication', 'devotion', 'country', 'may', 'have', 'floundered', 'not', 'survived', 'Adams', 'was', 'extremely', 'instrumental', 'country', 'creation', 'nurturing', 'survival.To', 'own', 'series', 'very', 'wise', 'investment', 'especially', 'are', 'history', 'buff', 'starkness', 'surroundings', 'how', 'were', 'portrayed', 'film', 'seemed', 'target', 'background', 'seemed', 'match', 'moods', 'Adams', 'what', 'characters', 'had', 'go', 'endure', 'not', 'give', 'up.Laura', 'Linney', 'Paul', 'Giamatti', 'Adams', 'couple', 'were', 'superb', 'had', 'say', 'once', 'again', 'was', 'very', 'impressed', 'Stephen', 'Dillane', 'portrayal', 'appreciated', 'rendition', 'Jefferson', 'as', 'much', 'liked', 'Dillane', 'Anna', 'Karenina', 'surprise', 'performance', '.Tom', 'Wilkinson', 'had', 'fine', 'moments', 'Ben', 'Franklin', 'David', 'Morse', 'was', 'superb', 'George', 'Washington', 'Rufus', 'Sewell', 'played', 'Alexander', 'Hamilton', 'have', 'say', 'Sewell', 'performance', 'disliked', 'Hamilton', 'as', 'much', 'disliked', 'character', 'played', 'movie', 'Holiday', 'performance', 'was', 'also', 'spot', 'insensitive', 'manipulative', 'impressed', 'was', 'intimate', 'look', 'dynamics', 'perilous', 'times', 'when', 'country', 'was', 'born', 'So', 'much', 'could', 'have', 'gone', 'wrong', 'did', 'great', 'sacrifices', 'great', 'men', 'everything', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'different', 'Very', 'different.Posterity', 'lot', 'be', 'grateful', 'have', 'wonder', 'are', 'capable', 'sacrifices', 'so', 'many', 'had', 'make', 'preserve', 'keep', 'freedoms', 'forefathers', 'were', 'made', 'right', 'stuff', 'were', 'who', 'fought', 'wars', 'protect', 'back', 'home', 'just', 'seemed', 'conclusion', 'very', 'moving', 'dramatization', 'recurring', 'theme', 'reminded', 'famous', 'speech', 'given', 'Winston', 'Churchill', '1940', 'resulting', 'poster', 'read', 'Never', 'was', 'so', 'much', 'owed', 'so', 'many', 'so', 'few', 'Recommended', 'A-Bentley/2008John', 'Adams', 'HBO', 'Miniseries']",John Adams

While Paul Giamatti, at first blush, did not seem the John Adams type, his generous, authentic performance was over the top. I admire the fact that screenwriters incorporated so much essential information in less than eight hours of running time, and that the drama never flagged for a moment.I must say that this was Laura Linney's film. Her portrayal of Abigail exceeded all my expectations and reminded me how underutilized this splendid actress has been in the US. She brought her role to life with humor, pathos and innuendo. Her dialogues with Jefferson smoked. Her occasional rages at John, for all his absences, were wrenching. And the scene in which she watches her children receive innoculations for smallpox was deeply disturbing. In turn, her struggle to maintain emotional strength as Nabby struggled to survive the illness were unspeakably moving.I could go on and on about the cameos and other principal performances, perhaps the most surprising of which was David Morse as Washington.

1109396,A2ATWKOFJXRRR1,B000WGWQG8,"B. Merritt ""filmreviewstew.com""","[1, 1]","How much do you know about John Adams? I mean really know? If you're Pulitzer Prize winning author David McCullough, you know enough to share this enigmatic former President with the world.Not much of a congenial man, nor known to hold his tongue in tight situations, Adams has often been brushed aside by historians in favor of the more famous George Washington (played here by David Morse,16 Blocks) and Declaration of Independence creator Thomas Jefferson (played by Stephen Dillane,The Greatest Game Ever Played). Even Ben Franklin (Tom Wilkinson,Michael Clayton) has more political notoriety than poor Mr. Adams. But Adams is so incredibly important to our nation that he deserves much more notice, and thanks to Mr. McCullough's astounding novel, there's been a resurgence in interest to the former President, thus this new miniseries by HBO.Paul Giamatti (Lady in the Water) stars as John Adams, the first Vice-President (Did you remember that?) and the second President of these United States (Did you remember that, too?). His trail to fame and Presidential glory is paved with danger, disease, love, and loss.Giamatti's performance is especially notable in that he pulls off a ""man of the times"" role in effortless fashion. It didn't hurt, either, that the costumes were exquisitely done, the sets dirty, muddy and generally what one would expect to see around the mid-late-and-post 1700s. Adams lived to a ripe old age, too, of 91 (a good run in any era). During his lifetime he will be witness to the Boston Massacre, the Revolution against Great Britain, become the first minister to Britain after the U.S. gained its independence, and serve as Vice-President and President. A life not ordinary. Especially when you consider the nature of the man: broodish, quick to anger, stubborn in decision-making. But his temper was ...tempered by a friendship that would last a lifetime. And I'm not talking about his well-known association with Thomas Jefferson. I'm talking about the person whom he called ""My dearest friend."" Of course, this was Abigail Adams (played with exceptional poise by Laura Linney,The Squid and the Whale), his dedicated wife and stalwart confidant. The two were opposite sides of the same coin and proved to be a formidable pairing. When John was angry, Abigail calmed him. When he was writing, Abigail was his editor. When he was away from home (often), she took care of the children, the farm ...everything.Although this miniseries didn't incorporate all that John Adams was (how could it?), it did perform the prerequisite of showing us a glimpse of a man and how he battled the developing politics of his new country while trying to be the patriarchal leader of his extended family. Being a beer drinking man myself, I couldn't help but pay closer attention whenever Samuel Adams (John Adams' cousin) was mentioned or showed up on screen (played by Danny Huston,30 Days of Night). Although just a side-note by comparison to the rest of the film, it is topical to mention that John Adams' son, John QUINCY Adams (Ebon Moss-Bachrach,The Lake House), was the first son of a former President to become President himself (but I think he did a tad better at it than our current `son-of-a-former-President'). These touched-on items added more historical depth to the story and made the viewing audience equally enamored with John Adams even if the man himself was the complete opposite.This seven part miniseries is exceptional with costumes and sets that play the part just as well as the actors themselves. And if you've forgotten about John Adams' past, well, this is a nice refresher.",4,How Easily We Forget Those With Less Flair,1216339200,"07 18, 2008",2008,3618,"['How', 'much', 'do', 'know', 'John', 'Adams', 'mean', 'really', 'know', ""'re"", 'Pulitzer', 'Prize', 'winning', 'author', 'David', 'McCullough', 'know', 'enough', 'share', 'enigmatic', 'former', 'President', 'world.Not', 'much', 'congenial', 'man', 'known', 'hold', 'tongue', 'tight', 'situations', 'Adams', 'often', 'been', 'brushed', 'aside', 'historians', 'favor', 'more', 'famous', 'George', 'Washington', 'played', 'here', 'David', 'Morse,16', 'Blocks', 'Declaration', 'Independence', 'creator', 'Thomas', 'Jefferson', 'played', 'Stephen', 'Dillane', 'Greatest', 'Game', 'Ever', 'Played', 'Even', 'Ben', 'Franklin', 'Tom', 'Wilkinson', 'Michael', 'Clayton', 'more', 'political', 'notoriety', 'poor', 'Mr.', 'Adams', 'Adams', 'so', 'incredibly', 'important', 'nation', 'much', 'more', 'notice', 'thanks', 'Mr.', 'McCullough', 'astounding', 'novel', 'been', 'resurgence', 'interest', 'former', 'President', 'thus', 'new', 'miniseries', 'HBO.Paul', 'Giamatti', 'Lady', 'Water', 'John', 'Adams', 'first', 'Vice-President', 'Did', 'remember', 'second', 'President', 'United', 'States', 'Did', 'remember', 'too', 'trail', 'fame', 'Presidential', 'glory', 'paved', 'danger', 'disease', 'love', 'performance', 'especially', 'notable', 'man', 'times', 'role', 'effortless', 'fashion', 'did', ""n't"", 'hurt', 'either', 'costumes', 'were', 'exquisitely', 'done', 'sets', 'dirty', 'muddy', 'generally', 'what', 'one', 'would', 'expect', 'see', 'mid-late-and-post', '1700s', 'Adams', 'lived', 'ripe', 'old', 'age', 'too', '91', 'good', 'run', 'era', 'lifetime', 'will', 'be', 'witness', 'Boston', 'Massacre', 'Revolution', 'Great', 'Britain', 'become', 'first', 'minister', 'Britain', 'U.S.', 'gained', 'independence', 'serve', 'Vice-President', 'President', 'A', 'life', 'not', 'ordinary', 'Especially', 'when', 'consider', 'nature', 'man', 'broodish', 'quick', 'anger', 'stubborn', 'decision-making', 'temper', 'was', 'tempered', 'friendship', 'would', 'last', 'lifetime', ""'m"", 'not', 'talking', 'well-known', 'association', 'Thomas', 'Jefferson', ""'m"", 'talking', 'person', 'whom', 'called', 'dearest', 'friend', 'course', 'was', 'Abigail', 'Adams', 'played', 'exceptional', 'poise', 'Laura', 'Linney', 'Squid', 'Whale', 'dedicated', 'wife', 'stalwart', 'confidant', 'two', 'were', 'opposite', 'sides', 'same', 'coin', 'proved', 'be', 'formidable', 'pairing', 'When', 'John', 'was', 'angry', 'Abigail', 'calmed', 'When', 'was', 'writing', 'Abigail', 'was', 'editor', 'When', 'was', 'away', 'home', 'often', 'took', 'care', 'children', 'farm', 'miniseries', 'did', ""n't"", 'incorporate', 'John', 'Adams', 'was', 'how', 'could', 'did', 'perform', 'prerequisite', 'showing', 'glimpse', 'man', 'how', 'battled', 'developing', 'politics', 'new', 'country', 'trying', 'be', 'patriarchal', 'leader', 'extended', 'family', 'Being', 'beer', 'drinking', 'man', 'could', ""n't"", 'help', 'pay', 'closer', 'attention', 'whenever', 'Samuel', 'Adams', 'John', 'Adams', 'cousin', 'was', 'mentioned', 'showed', 'up', 'screen', 'played', 'Danny', 'Huston,30', 'Days', 'Night', 'just', 'side-note', 'comparison', 'rest', 'film', 'topical', 'mention', 'John', 'Adams', 'son', 'John', 'QUINCY', 'Adams', 'Ebon', 'Moss-Bachrach', 'Lake', 'House', 'was', 'first', 'son', 'former', 'President', 'become', 'President', 'think', 'did', 'tad', 'better', 'current', 'son-of-a-former-President', 'touched-on', 'items', 'added', 'more', 'historical', 'depth', 'story', 'made', 'viewing', 'audience', 'equally', 'enamored', 'John', 'Adams', 'even', 'man', 'was', 'complete', 'opposite.This', 'seven', 'part', 'miniseries', 'exceptional', 'costumes', 'sets', 'play', 'part', 'just', 'as', 'well', 'actors', ""'ve"", 'forgotten', 'John', 'Adams', 'past', 'well', 'nice', 'refresher']",John Adams

1109419,A2PBV1899CX3TE,B000WGWQG8,"C. CRADDOCK ""Cr@$#!!!!""","[5, 6]","David McCullough, the historian who wrote the biography of John Adams upon which this seven part mini-series was based, has won 2 Pulitzer Prizes. After seeing John Adams it is easy to see why. He researches his subjects until he almost knows them better than his own family. He takes what he has learned and tells the story so you see not only what they did, but why. He brings history to life. By focusing on John Adams he was careful not to be distracted too much by all the colorful characters such as Jefferson, Washington, Hamilton, and Franklin. They were all in the story, but it followed Adams and the Adams family, leaving out lots of other material. The story was about Adams and his role in the foundation of our republic, so that was as it should be. Adams has until now been kind of an unsung hero.Abigail Adams was also an unsung heroine, well played by Laura Linney. She was a feminist before there was even a word for such a thing, and gave her husband, John Adams, great advice. When he was away from her, he often made bad decisions. Unfortunately, she spent many years apart from him. After the American Revolution, she did get to join him in Europe, where she made quite an impression. While there she had an interesting flirtation with Thomas Jefferson, but later, when they were political enemies, she backed her husband to the hilt. Abigail had severe trials and tribulations, like when she had to have her family vacinated against smallpox. This was a risky and untested medical procedure in the 1700's. Abigail ran a farm and family, often all on her own.Throughout John Adams there was great production with lots of special effects and green screens to produce epic crowds and battles, and all manner of magnificent historical moments. Very good attention to the detail of the clothes, even changing styles year by year. What kind of three cornered hats did the fashionable folk wear in 1776? Watching John Adams, you are taken back in time to those tumultous days.Hamilton was a very interesting character and the dynamic between he and Jefferson, or Hamilton and Washington, was clearly illuminated. Hamilton longed to be an aristocrat and thought the country should be ruled by the rich and elite, or even a monarchy; while Jefferson believed in the ideal of Democracy. He saw his path to glory through war, which he longed for. Hamilton was much smarter about finances than Jefferson, and we have him to thank for our Federal Banks. Though Hamilton was an aide to George Washington, many thought that through his strong will he was really the one pulling the strings. Hamilton was well played by Rufus Sewell, who captured what must have been Alexander Hamilton's intensity well.In John Adams there is a great scene when in later years Adams views the iconic painting of the signing of the declaration of independence but says they were never all in one place signing, but scurrying to and fro preparing for war. He was kind of grumpy, and had his sideways ""Merlot"" moments, but after all he had been through, you could see why he felt and acted as he did.John Adams had some disappointments with his children, like one died an alcoholic, and another married a man who got into severe debt and had to leave his wife to seek work elsewhere. This daughter had breast cancer, had a masectomy, and later died after a relapse. On a more positive note, his oldest son, John Quincy Adams, later became President, though both John and John Quincy Adams only lasted for one term apiece.Paul Giamatti was great as Mr. Adams. He played Adams in every direction but sideways. Like Giamatti, Adams was short, grumpy, and not very attractive, but he held to his principles and accomplished a lot.Giamatti showed well the successes and failures of John Adams -- his strengths and his flaws -- for instance, he was really a fish out of water in France, and awkward as well in Britain, after the war. In France he couldn't keep up with Franklin. In Britain, he meets young insane King George and has to bow awkwardly. He spoke out and said what was on his mind, but this wasn't always the most diplomatic way to approach.Adams was ready to fight and go to war if necessary, but after the American Revolution was over he opposed Alexander Hamilton who wanted very badly to go to war with France. Though Adams mostly sided with Jefferson against Hamilton, Jefferson repayed him with betrayal, when for political reasons Thomas Jefferson was harshly critical and spread vicious rumors. Interestingly, too, as Adams got older he gave up his grudge and corresponded with Jefferson, as there was hardly anyone left who had been through what they had been through, who could understand and talk about it with him. Their correspondence was a great source of material for John Adams, the seven part mini-series.Great ending when both he and Jefferson die on the Fourth of July, exactly 50 years after 1776. How thoughtful of them to provide such an auspicious ending to the seven part mini-series. Famous last words of John Adams:-------------------John Adams: Thomas Jefferson survives.==========================Still competitive with his old rival, but actually it was Adams who survived Jefferson, if but only by a few hours. Though Jefferson was the author of the Declaration of Independence that said ""all men are created equal"" he was a slave owner. John and Abigail Adams managed to operate their farm without slaves.----------------------------John Adams: My thoughts are so clear to me... each one takes perfect shape within my mind. But when I speak, when I offer them to others, they seem to lose all definition.==================================John Adams wasn't the first time Giamatti and Linney played man and wife. In 2007'sThe Nanny Diaries (Widescreen Edition)Paul and Laura were Mr. and Mrs. X.Also in 2007 Laura Linney was inThe Savages, where she played Wendy Savage, Philip Seymour Hoffman's sister.Laura Linney was Claire, Gabriel Byrne's better half, in 2006'sJindabyne. This film from down under shows Claire struggling to make amends with the aboriginals when her husband finds a murdered woman floating in the river while on a fishing trip, and instead of going back to report it her husband and his fishing buddies keep on fishing.InThe Exorcism of Emily Rose - Unrated (Special Edition)(2005) Tom Wilkinson (who played Benjamin Franklin) was Father Moore; and Laura Linney was Erin Bruner.The Squid and the Whale (Special Edition), also from 2005, has Laura Linney as Joan Berkman, the wife of a self-absorbed professor played by Jeff Daniels.2004'sEternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mindgave us another great Tom Wilkinson performance as Dr. Howard Mierzwiak, the inventor of a process to erase unpleasant memories that is utilized by Jim Carrey and Kate Winslet to erase memories of each other.Laura Linney was playing Clara McMillen, the wife of Professor Albert Kinsey, in 2004'sKinsey. Though she often plays the wives of accomplished men, she is never overshadowed by them, and her own strong personality always comes through. She understands and admires the men, but also sees their faults all too clearly. Clara McMillen is the role that most reminded me of her Abigail Adams.Paul Giamatti was priceless as Miles, the wine connoisseur in the 2004 vintageSideways, who refused to drink Merlot. He played a very flawed individual who was very hard to like, but by the end he had you, and you too would henceforth eschew Merlot for Pinot Noir. When you think about it, Miles was kind of a latter day John Adams in some ways.InAmerican Splendorfrom 2003 Paul Giamatti was Harvey Pekar, another rugged individualist who could be grumpy and stubborn, like John Adams.Though 1998'sThe Truman Showstarred Jim Carrey, it did feature Laura Linney as Meryl Burbank and Hannah Gill; and Paul Giamatti was the Control Room Director. Who could predict that 200 years earlier they would end up married?--------------John Adams: I have seen a queen of France with 18 million livres of diamonds on her person, but I declare that all the charms of her face and figure added to all the glitter of her jewels did not impress me as much as that little shrub right there. Now your mother always said that I never delighted enough in the mundane, but now I find that if I look at even the smallest thing my imagination begins to roam the Milky Way!==================",5,if

He has been very lucky that many wonderful books have been written about him beside the famous McCullough one. I think of two in particular- Page Smith's two volume set and John Ferling's bio. I also liked the portrayal of him in the movie '1776' by William Daniels.This brings me back to Giamatti. He really made the role his own and got better and better as the series went along. By the time he reached the presidency he WAS John Adams. Giamatti has many great scenes and he really pulls out all the stops. His speech for the Declaration of Independence is grand and there are many wonderful scenes such as meeting King George III and his speech in the church in Episode I. I also like the use of 'Hail Columbia' in Episode 6. That scene alone is worth something in and of itself. Also a note about the wonderful credits that bring the old battle flags back to life. 'Don't tread on me' and 'Appeal to Heaven' are just two great old slogans in the flags. The opening credits are really stirring.Laura Linney pretty much matches Giamatti scene for scene. Abigail is also a favorite historical character of mine. I wrote a paper on Abigail in college and find her truly fascinating. Linney does a really great acting job and brings Abigail back to life. Also, Tom Wilkinson as Ben Franklin and Stephen Dillane as Thomas Jefferson are worthy of high praise. David Morse as George Washington is very good also but I liked the depiction of Washington by Jeff Daniels in 'The Crossing' a little better.I have only a few quibbles: there are some 'dutch angles' that were really not needed. The camerawork should just have been straight forward. Also, some of the historical facts are changed around for some reason. The real history is just as fascinating and should have been left alone. In this regard I think of the famous correspondence between Adams and Jefferson as being depicted as starting in 1818 after the death of Abigail instead of the actual time of 1812. In real life Abigail wrote some letters to Jefferson during this time. There are a few more factual changings but on the whole they don't detract that much from the miniseries. In the end I'm just thankful something like this was even made.Also, the closing scene of the miniseries will stay with you a long time and the wonderful quote by Adams that ends the miniseries really is a great finale.Highly recommended!",5,Great Miniseries,1249776000,"08 9, 2009",2009,2548,"['would', 'never', 'have', 'thought', 'Paul', 'Giamatti', 'John', 'Adams', 'off', 'excellent', 'style', 'Adams', 'been', 'one', 'favorite', 'founding', 'fathers', 'long', 'while', 'been', 'very', 'lucky', 'many', 'wonderful', 'books', 'have', 'been', 'written', 'beside', 'famous', 'McCullough', 'one', 'think', 'two', 'particular-', 'Page', 'Smith', 'two', 'volume', 'set', 'John', 'Ferling', 'bio', 'also', 'liked', 'portrayal', 'movie', 'William', 'Daniels.This', 'back', 'Giamatti', 'really', 'made', 'role', 'own', 'got', 'better', 'better', 'series', 'went', 'time', 'reached', 'presidency', 'WAS', 'John', 'Adams', 'Giamatti', 'many', 'great', 'scenes', 'really', 'out', 'stops', 'speech', 'Declaration', 'Independence', 'grand', 'are', 'many', 'wonderful', 'scenes', 'such', 'meeting', 'King', 'George', 'III', 'speech', 'church', 'Episode', 'I.', 'also', 'use', ""'Hail"", 'Columbia', 'Episode', '6', 'scene', 'alone', 'worth', 'something', 'Also', 'note', 'wonderful', 'credits', 'bring', 'old', 'battle', 'back', 'life', ""'Do"", ""n't"", 'tread', ""'Appeal"", 'Heaven', 'are', 'just', 'two', 'great', 'old', 'slogans', 'flags', 'opening', 'credits', 'are', 'really', 'stirring.Laura', 'Linney', 'pretty', 'much', 'matches', 'Giamatti', 'scene', 'scene', 'Abigail', 'also', 'favorite', 'historical', 'character', 'mine', 'wrote', 'paper', 'Abigail', 'college', 'find', 'truly', 'fascinating', 'Linney', 'really', 'great', 'acting', 'job', 'Abigail', 'back', 'life', 'Also', 'Tom', 'Wilkinson', 'Ben', 'Franklin', 'Stephen', 'Dillane', 'Thomas', 'Jefferson', 'are', 'worthy', 'high', 'praise', 'David', 'Morse', 'George', 'Washington', 'very', 'good', 'also', 'liked', 'depiction', 'Washington', 'Jeff', 'Daniels', ""'The"", 'Crossing', 'little', 'better.I', 'have', 'only', 'few', 'quibbles', 'are', ""'dutch"", 'angles', 'were', 'really', 'not', 'needed', 'camerawork', 'should', 'just', 'have', 'been', 'straight', 'forward', 'Also', 'historical', 'facts', 'are', 'changed', 'reason', 'real', 'history', 'just', 'fascinating', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'left', 'alone', 'regard', 'think', 'famous', 'correspondence', 'Adams', 'Jefferson', 'being', 'depicted', 'starting', '1818', 'death', 'Abigail', 'instead', 'actual', 'time', '1812', 'real', 'life', 'Abigail', 'wrote', 'letters', 'Jefferson', 'time', 'are', 'few', 'more', 'factual', 'changings', 'whole', 'do', ""n't"", 'detract', 'that', 'much', 'miniseries', 'end', ""'m"", 'just', 'thankful', 'something', 'was', 'even', 'made.Also', 'closing', 'scene', 'miniseries', 'will', 'stay', 'long', 'time', 'wonderful', 'quote', 'Adams', 'miniseries', 'really', 'great', 'finale.Highly', 'recommended']",John Adams

His protrayal of John Adams as one of the USA's Founding Fathers, its second President, and his role in the nation's first 50 years was dead on. And Laura Linney's as Abigail Adams was just as great as Paul's role.  And then, to see David Morse as George Washington?  Wow!  The makeup, etc was amazing!

1109428,A18YMFFJW974QS,B000WGWQG8,CKE,"[0, 2]","In the last 30 minutes of this epic mini-series John Adam (Paul Giamatti) viewed the famous John Trumbull's picture of the signing of the Declaration of Independence, John Adams states that he did not understand why people felt that they needed to modify history. The way it happened should be good enough (I am paraphrasing here).  That is my exact sentiment with HBO's presentation of ""John Adams"". Why did they need to make non-factual changes? Most of the changes were superficial to the story, but significant in the life of Adams.Many of these changes are well documented by other reviewers, however some of the changes are nonsensical. For example why did they feel he need to move up Nabby's death by 11 years?  Why did they not have Nabby and Colonel Smith meet in Europe? Why did they make it appear that John and Abigail only had John Quincy accompany them to Europe (when in fact, Charles and Nabby accompanied them). Oddly enough, HBO made this is a point of contention between Charles and John... that Charles was not allowed to join John in Europe! Why change history?Ok, now I will get off of my soap-box. In truth, the min-series ""John Adams"" was expertly done and deserves the many honors it has received. The sets and acting were phenomenal (see ""Thomas Jefferson"", ""George Washington"", and best of all ""Benjamin Franklin"") and true to the period. In the first chapter I was completely enthralled by the 1770's Boston. It was beyond anything that I could have imagined.While I have never been a Paul Giamatti fan - he was an excellent choice for John Adams. Giamatti was able to portray both the insecurities and physical attributes nearly flawlessly (although interestingly enough they did make mistakes with his teeth as they alternated between normal and rotten).  Giamatti clearly mastered the role and embodied everything  that we would expect from Adams.A note for teachers - I was disappointed in the nudity in the first and last installment. While neither were sexual in nature in my opinion ""implied"" nudity would have been just as effective. As it stands, neither the first nor last chapter could be used in a class room. There is also a graphic scene of Mr. & Mrs. Adams when they meet for the first time in Paris. No nudity, but it probably would not be allowed by your school's principle.Things that I liked about the movie- The portrayal of John and Abigail Adams was excellent- The sets and costumes....wow- Special features on the disc - make a nice commentary to the movie- The portrayals of George Washington, Ben Franklin, and Thomas Jefferson- The length of the mini-series - my biggest compliment to HBO is that they did not skimp and cut but embraced the entire life of John Adams- The price of the DVDs - honestly this is a bargain for the amount of material that you are getting!Areas for improvement- The purposeful misrepresentation of the natural occurrence in John Adams life. I am completely clueless in why HBO did not stay true to history and David McCullough's book. This cost it a star- The unnecessary nudity.Final verdict - Was the mini-series flawed in terms of pure history... Absolutely! Is it worth watching - YES! If this wasn't based on David McCullough's masterful biography I would rate ""John Adams"" as one of top 10 movies. However, since the biography drifted into fiction I have to downgrade it a bit.4 stars - great for those 16 and over (although most high schoolers may be bored to tears).",4,"Adams said it best, ""Why change history?""",1231632000,"01 11, 2009",2009,3457,"['last', '30', 'minutes', 'epic', 'mini-series', 'John', 'Adam', 'Paul', 'Giamatti', 'viewed', 'famous', 'John', 'Trumbull', 'picture', 'signing', 'Declaration', 'Independence', 'John', 'Adams', 'did', 'not', 'understand', 'why', 'people', 'felt', 'needed', 'modify', 'history', 'way', 'happened', 'should', 'be', 'good', 'enough', 'am', 'paraphrasing', 'here', 'exact', 'sentiment', 'HBO', 'presentation', 'John', 'Adams', 'Why', 'did', 'need', 'make', 'non-factual', 'changes', 'Most', 'changes', 'were', 'superficial', 'story', 'significant', 'life', 'Adams.Many', 'changes', 'are', 'well', 'documented', 'other', 'reviewers', 'however', 'changes', 'are', 'nonsensical', 'example', 'why', 'did', 'feel', 'need', 'move', 'up', 'Nabby', 'death', '11', 'years', 'Why', 'did', 'not', 'have', 'Nabby', 'Colonel', 'Smith', 'meet', 'Europe', 'Why', 'did', 'make', 'appear', 'John', 'Abigail', 'only', 'had', 'John', 'Quincy', 'accompany', 'Europe', 'when', 'fact', 'Charles', 'Nabby', 'accompanied', 'Oddly', 'enough', 'HBO', 'made', 'point', 'contention', 'Charles', 'John', 'Charles', 'was', 'not', 'allowed', 'join', 'John', 'Europe', 'Why', 'change', 'history', 'Ok', 'now', 'will', 'get', 'soap-box', 'truth', 'min-series', 'John', 'Adams', 'was', 'expertly', 'done', 'many', 'honors', 'received', 'sets', 'acting', 'were', 'phenomenal', 'see', 'Thomas', 'Jefferson', 'George', 'Washington', 'best', 'Benjamin', 'Franklin', 'true', 'period', 'first', 'chapter', 'was', 'completely', 'enthralled', '1770', 'Boston', 'was', 'anything', 'could', 'have', 'imagined.While', 'have', 'never', 'been', 'Paul', 'Giamatti', 'fan', 'was', 'excellent', 'choice', 'John', 'Adams', 'Giamatti', 'was', 'able', 'portray', 'insecurities', 'physical', 'attributes', 'nearly', 'flawlessly', 'interestingly', 'did', 'make', 'mistakes', 'teeth', 'alternated', 'normal', 'rotten', 'Giamatti', 'clearly', 'mastered', 'role', 'embodied', 'everything', 'would', 'expect', 'Adams.A', 'note', 'teachers', 'was', 'disappointed', 'nudity', 'first', 'last', 'installment', 'were', 'sexual', 'nature', 'opinion', 'implied', 'nudity', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'just', 'effective', 'first', 'last', 'chapter', 'could', 'be', 'used', 'class', 'room', 'also', 'graphic', 'scene', 'Mr.', 'Mrs.', 'Adams', 'when', 'meet', 'first', 'time', 'Paris', 'nudity', 'probably', 'would', 'not', 'be', 'allowed', 'school', 'principle.Things', 'liked', 'movie-', 'portrayal', 'John', 'Abigail', 'Adams', 'was', 'excellent-', 'sets', 'costumes', '.wow-', 'Special', 'features', 'disc', 'make', 'nice', 'commentary', 'movie-', 'portrayals', 'George', 'Washington', 'Ben', 'Franklin', 'Thomas', 'Jefferson-', 'length', 'mini-series', 'biggest', 'compliment', 'HBO', 'did', 'not', 'skimp', 'cut', 'embraced', 'entire', 'life', 'John', 'Adams-', 'price', 'DVDs', 'honestly', 'bargain', 'amount', 'material', 'are', 'getting', 'Areas', 'improvement-', 'purposeful', 'misrepresentation', 'natural', 'occurrence', 'John', 'Adams', 'life', 'am', 'completely', 'clueless', 'why', 'HBO', 'did', 'not', 'stay', 'true', 'history', 'David', 'McCullough', 'book', 'cost', 'star-', 'unnecessary', 'nudity.Final', 'verdict', 'Was', 'mini-series', 'flawed', 'terms', 'pure', 'history', 'Absolutely', 'worth', 'watching', 'YES', 'was', ""n't"", 'based', 'David', 'McCullough', 'masterful', 'biography', 'would', 'rate', 'John', 'Adams', 'one', 'top', '10', 'movies', 'However', 'biography', 'drifted', 'fiction', 'have', 'downgrade', 'bit.4', 'great', '16', 'over', 'most', 'high', 'schoolers', 'may', 'be', 'bored', 'tears']",John Adams

1109430,A1CZW9Q0JXEE6N,B000WGWQG8,Clint D. Hayes,"[10, 12]","I'm clearly in the minority on this, but as much as I loved McCullough's book--I was already a fan of Adams from the Adams/Jefferson letters that I'd read--and as much as I wanted then to like this series--I just couldn't. It turned me off so much, in fact, I couldn't even finish it. The Adams in the HBO series just isn't the Adams I've come to know in McCullough's book, the Adams/Jefferson letters, and John/Abigail letters. Some of it is there, certainly, but Giamatti's performance is uniformly petulant, irritable, and whiny. I'm reminded of Dorothy Parker's criticism of Katherine Hepburn: ""She ran the whole gamut of emotions from A to B."" Adams certainly could be all three, but was clearly so much more--a more vital, gravitational personality--and you'll never see it--indeed, get even a glimpse of it--in HBO's John Adams. While in an obviously frothier vein, Bill Daniels' forceful portrayal of Adams in the film adaptation of the musical 1776 is far truer to the man described in the book and letters. He, at least, could convincingly be the Adams described by his peers and the match for Abigail, which was never the case for me with Giamatti's shrinking whiner. When he is supposed to be forceful, he merely comes off as a brat. At no point during the HBO series could I bring myself to believe that it was Giamatti's Adams that the other characters were talking about. He simply wasn't believable to me, to the extent that I simply couldn't watch him anymore. I had to retrieve the book and letters from my bookshelf to cleanse my palate and revisit the man of his words.Which is a criticism I have of the writing itself. Such work in a supposedly epic telling, and yet again I find a much more understandable presentation of Adams in the film 1776 than in four hours (so far) of HBO's production. After four episodes I still couldn't perceive a coherent philosophy, and challenge anyone watching it cold to produce one. The production spent far too much time on the minutiae of moments at the expense of a clear depiction of the man himself. Ultimately it was all about emotions--and again, only a couple of them--rather than thoughts. But then this is modern Hollywood's obsession--excessive but ultimately superficial verisimilitude--which is why its characterizations pale in comparison to the best of the past.The same problem extends to the production itself. There is a fanatical attention to detail, including superb visual and special effects, but once again at the expense of the story. Rather than simply putting a camera on an actor and letting him act, Adams' director Tom Hooper, like so many of his peers, feels he must ""put us in the moment"" with hand-held camera work and oblique camera angles, or create an interesting canvas through off-center compositions and muted colors. All he does instead is distract the viewer and draw attention to himself instead of the characters. Oh but for the chance to lock the present generation of directors in a room playing Ford, Huston, Hawks, and Wyler movies non-stop until they finally learn what they clearly never have about storytelling.I am happy, actually, that so many have enjoyed this series so much, but it's more than disappointing--aggravating--that the John Adams they're given is such a feral dog compared to the force of nature and penetrating mind, vain, stubborn, and obnoxious as it is, that comes through his letters.",3,A disappointment,1237766400,"03 23, 2009",2009,3411,"[""'m"", 'clearly', 'minority', 'as', 'much', 'loved', 'McCullough', 'book', 'was', 'already', 'fan', 'Adams', 'Adams/Jefferson', 'letters', ""'d"", 'read', 'as', 'much', 'wanted', 'then', 'like', 'series', 'just', 'could', ""n't"", 'turned', 'off', 'so', 'much', 'fact', 'could', ""n't"", 'even', 'finish', 'Adams', 'HBO', 'series', 'just', ""n't"", 'Adams', ""'ve"", 'come', 'know', 'McCullough', 'book', 'Adams/Jefferson', 'letters', 'John/Abigail', 'letters', 'there', 'certainly', 'Giamatti', 'performance', 'uniformly', 'petulant', 'irritable', 'whiny', ""'m"", 'reminded', 'Dorothy', 'Parker', 'criticism', 'Katherine', 'Hepburn', 'ran', 'whole', 'gamut', 'emotions', 'B', 'Adams', 'certainly', 'could', 'be', 'three', 'was', 'clearly', 'so', 'much', 'more', 'more', 'vital', 'gravitational', 'personality', ""'ll"", 'never', 'see', 'indeed', 'get', 'even', 'glimpse', 'HBO', 'John', 'Adams', 'obviously', 'frothier', 'vein', 'Bill', 'Daniels', 'forceful', 'portrayal', 'Adams', 'film', 'adaptation', 'musical', '1776', 'far', 'truer', 'man', 'described', 'book', 'letters', 'least', 'could', 'convincingly', 'be', 'Adams', 'described', 'peers', 'match', 'Abigail', 'was', 'never', 'case', 'Giamatti', 'shrinking', 'whiner', 'When', 'supposed', 'be', 'forceful', 'merely', 'off', 'brat', 'point', 'HBO', 'series', 'could', 'bring', 'believe', 'was', 'Giamatti', 'Adams', 'other', 'characters', 'were', 'talking', 'about', 'simply', 'was', ""n't"", 'believable', 'extent', 'simply', 'could', ""n't"", 'watch', 'anymore', 'had', 'retrieve', 'book', 'letters', 'bookshelf', 'cleanse', 'palate', 'revisit', 'man', 'words.Which', 'criticism', 'have', 'writing', 'Such', 'work', 'supposedly', 'epic', 'telling', 'yet', 'again', 'find', 'much', 'more', 'understandable', 'presentation', 'Adams', 'film', '1776', 'four', 'hours', 'so', 'far', 'HBO', 'production', 'four', 'episodes', 'still', 'could', ""n't"", 'perceive', 'coherent', 'philosophy', 'challenge', 'anyone', 'watching', 'cold', 'produce', 'one', 'production', 'spent', 'far', 'too', 'much', 'time', 'minutiae', 'moments', 'expense', 'clear', 'depiction', 'man', 'Ultimately', 'was', 'emotions', 'again', 'only', 'couple', 'rather', 'thoughts', 'then', 'modern', 'Hollywood', 'obsession', 'excessive', 'ultimately', 'superficial', 'verisimilitude', 'why', 'characterizations', 'pale', 'comparison', 'best', 'past.The', 'same', 'problem', 'production', 'fanatical', 'attention', 'detail', 'including', 'superb', 'visual', 'special', 'effects', 'once', 'again', 'expense', 'story', 'Rather', 'simply', 'putting', 'camera', 'actor', 'letting', 'act', 'Adams', 'director', 'Tom', 'Hooper', 'so', 'many', 'peers', 'feels', 'must', 'put', 'moment', 'hand-held', 'camera', 'work', 'oblique', 'camera', 'angles', 'create', 'interesting', 'canvas', 'off-center', 'compositions', 'muted', 'colors', 'instead', 'distract', 'viewer', 'draw', 'attention', 'instead', 'characters', 'Oh', 'chance', 'lock', 'present', 'generation', 'directors', 'room', 'playing', 'Ford', 'Huston', 'Hawks', 'Wyler', 'movies', 'non-stop', 'finally', 'learn', 'what', 'clearly', 'never', 'have', 'storytelling.I', 'am', 'happy', 'actually', 'so', 'many', 'have', 'enjoyed', 'series', 'so', 'much', 'more', 'disappointing', 'aggravating', 'John', 'Adams', ""'re"", 'given', 'such', 'feral', 'dog', 'compared', 'force', 'nature', 'penetrating', 'mind', 'vain', 'stubborn', 'obnoxious', 'letters']",John Adams

I was stunned and captivated and a week after watching this excellent HBO offering, spent a fair amount of time reflecting on this vital piece of American history. We tend to think of the Founding Fathers as a dull bunch who had the whole issue of creating the United States figured out from the get-go. No so. What makes John Adams so important as president is that he followed the beloved and charismatic George Washington at a time when there was serious dissention as to where the American Experiment would lead. Adams, ascerbic, bald and portly, and quite unpleasant at times, could have soured the citizenry on the idea of presidents altogether and had to play a balancing act between the still dangerous Great Britain and the aggressively revolutionary France (which we almost went to war with during his tenure). Nor was the Declaration of Independence and the American Revolution assured to succeed. In one of the most brilliant scenes ever filmed of our history, the colonies vote unaminously (after much backroom wheeling-dealing and arm-twisting) for independence thus breaking irrevocably from Great Britain. One would expect soaring music, cheers, hats thrown in the air and the waving of flags. Instead, the denoument is staged in complete silence....each delegate rendered silent and stunned, as if they had just signed a suicide pact (which, indeed, it could have been).That said, ""John Adams"" is a marvel mainly for it's extrordinary casting in which it appears that the producers took a time machine back to the 18th century and kidnapped the principals for this miniseries. In particular, David Morse portrays Washington with a regal gravitas that dominates every scene he is in and Tom Wilkinson as Ben Franklin equally steals the show. Stephan Dillane is fascinating as Thomas Jefferson, Adam's friend and adversary who died on the same day he did. None of them, however, take away from the superb acting of Paul Giamatti as the lead and Laura Linney as the vital Abigail Adams, his ""ballast"" as he calls her, a woman so ahead of her time, I'm amazed she didn't explode from frustration.The sets, costuming and general rendering of the time period are equally stunning and one should take time to view the bonus features which include a lively interview with author David McCullough and a fascinating ""Making of"" doc.Although unrated, this is NOT a film for children as it features some gruesome (and accurate) depictions of period medical practices which will make viewers go down on their knees and thank God for our present system, imperfect as it is.",5,An Unexpectedly Excellent Epic,1214524800,"06 27, 2008",2008,2670,"['came', 'having', 'not', 'read', 'book', 'known', 'much', 'second', 'president', 'was', 'stunned', 'captivated', 'week', 'watching', 'excellent', 'HBO', 'offering', 'spent', 'fair', 'amount', 'time', 'reflecting', 'vital', 'piece', 'American', 'history', 'tend', 'think', 'Founding', 'Fathers', 'dull', 'bunch', 'who', 'had', 'whole', 'issue', 'creating', 'United', 'States', 'figured', 'out', 'get-go', 'so', 'What', 'John', 'Adams', 'so', 'important', 'president', 'followed', 'beloved', 'charismatic', 'George', 'Washington', 'time', 'when', 'was', 'serious', 'dissention', 'where', 'American', 'Experiment', 'would', 'lead', 'Adams', 'ascerbic', 'bald', 'portly', 'quite', 'unpleasant', 'times', 'could', 'have', 'soured', 'citizenry', 'idea', 'presidents', 'altogether', 'had', 'play', 'balancing', 'act', 'still', 'dangerous', 'Great', 'Britain', 'aggressively', 'revolutionary', 'France', 'almost', 'went', 'war', 'tenure', 'was', 'Declaration', 'Independence', 'American', 'Revolution', 'assured', 'succeed', 'one', 'most', 'brilliant', 'scenes', 'ever', 'filmed', 'history', 'colonies', 'vote', 'unaminously', 'much', 'backroom', 'wheeling-dealing', 'arm-twisting', 'independence', 'thus', 'breaking', 'irrevocably', 'Great', 'Britain', 'One', 'would', 'expect', 'soaring', 'music', 'cheers', 'hats', 'thrown', 'air', 'waving', 'flags', 'Instead', 'denoument', 'staged', 'complete', 'silence', '.each', 'delegate', 'rendered', 'silent', 'stunned', 'had', 'just', 'signed', 'suicide', 'pact', 'indeed', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'said', 'John', 'Adams', 'marvel', 'mainly', 'extrordinary', 'casting', 'producers', 'took', 'time', 'machine', 'back', '18th', 'century', 'kidnapped', 'principals', 'miniseries', 'particular', 'David', 'Morse', 'Washington', 'regal', 'gravitas', 'scene', 'Tom', 'Wilkinson', 'Ben', 'Franklin', 'equally', 'show', 'Stephan', 'Dillane', 'fascinating', 'Thomas', 'Jefferson', 'Adam', 'friend', 'adversary', 'who', 'died', 'same', 'day', 'did', 'None', 'however', 'take', 'away', 'superb', 'acting', 'Paul', 'Giamatti', 'lead', 'Laura', 'Linney', 'vital', 'Abigail', 'Adams', 'ballast', 'woman', 'so', 'ahead', 'time', ""'m"", 'amazed', 'did', ""n't"", 'explode', 'frustration.The', 'sets', 'costuming', 'general', 'rendering', 'time', 'period', 'are', 'equally', 'stunning', 'one', 'should', 'take', 'time', 'view', 'bonus', 'include', 'lively', 'interview', 'author', 'David', 'McCullough', 'fascinating', 'Making', 'doc.Although', 'unrated', 'NOT', 'film', 'children', 'gruesome', 'accurate', 'depictions', 'period', 'medical', 'practices', 'will', 'make', 'viewers', 'go', 'down', 'knees', 'thank', 'God', 'present', 'system', 'imperfect']",John Adams

Baer,"[0, 0]","HBO's magnificent screen portrait of John Adams and his fellows at a time when they were 'winging it'--as historian David McCullough has it in HBO's online site for the show--is simply brilliant film-making. It should be viewed in every classroom of the nation from which this reviewer ponders the deeply moving experience of having done so in his living room.Adams was the kind of politician--he would have hated the word and the notion to which it refers--for which the most secular among us should urgently pray. He had no stomach for the thing and only wanted to return to spread his best manure-soil mix on his beloved New England farm. Principled, articulate, and stubborn, he learned in the earnest fray of the revolutionary years the art of intelligent compromise. Paul Giamatti never lets us look away from the pain it caused him to lead, nor to easily evade the burden of historical gratitude that we owe to him, to his wife and family, and to those who labored beside them in the birth pangs of a nation.There was no plan, there was no aged wisdom, there was only the pressing task at hand. The making of sausage is never pretty. Rarely has its product mattered as much.Laura Linney is incendiary as Adams' pillar, his rock, his 'best friend' and wife Abigail. Nations have mothers, too. Abigail Adams and Laura Linney make the case for their costly legacy as few others could.Stephen Dillane is exceptionally compelling as Thomas Jefferson, passing through his various experimental stages at a time when the shape of a people's government depended in part on what he thought *today*.We are fortunate that Executive Producer Tom Hanks has turned his formidable intelligence and influence to projects like Saving Private Ryan and John Adams. The man is well on his way to serving as a kind of cinematic elder statesmen, encouraging his fellow citizens to keep their finger in the dike against the surging waters of amnesia and indifference. Hanks could be doing many things or, quite comfortably, nothing. That he engages projects like this one means the world is a slightly better place today than it might have been.'American exceptionalism' has quite rightly taken a lot of heat in recent years. Like most overstatements, it contains a kernel of truth. JOHN ADAMS probes gorgeously, pedagogically, entertainingly at that kernel.

HBO has produced some other ambitious projects that were well done, and this production will take its place beside their previous endeavors.  Paul Giamatti BECOMES one of our founding fathers, and the rest of the casting is outstanding as well - including Laura Linney as the stalwart Abigal Adams.While the series is in seven parts, it still glosses over Adam's life, sticking to the most salient aspects.  Indeed, each one of the seven sections could have been sub-divided into seven sections by themselves as the miniseries covers so many crucial aspects of the early days of this country - including the lead-up to the Revolutionary war.  Episode 1 picks up on the infamous evening of the Boston massacre, and the rest of the sections carry through until the end of Adams' life.While I knew in a generic sense a lot of what was presented in this series, the DVDs did a terrific job of elucidating many of the subtle details which I was unaware of.  It is a big budget production and I actually felt like one of the colonists who existed some 200yrs ago.This DVD set is highly recommended for history buffs & non-history buffs alike.

Though this miniseries did inform and entertain, I'm not sure where fact ends and creative license begins. However, I take some small comfort in the hope that Mr. McCullough's input, if he had any input at all, steered HBO's writers on the path historical accuracy.As for the acting, kudos to Paul Giamatti, Laura Linney, and Stephen Dillane for their amazing acting performances. I don't think they could've done a finer job, especially Giamatti, who I never liked for some reason, but now I have a new-found respect for his acting abilities. I don't think he's ever done a part that has challenged him as much as John Adams has. I guess he just needed to be given the chance to shine. Good for him.Now I'm off to read David McCullough's bestselling biography so I can be sure I fill those gaps in my knowledge concerning Mr. Adams' political career.

In this series, all details were paramount.  This viewer felt as tho she was in Boston, or New York, or Philadelphia, in those early days!  The ""Boston Massacre"" story was told way differently than it was from my grade school days!  And that John Adams was the representative in court for the accused British soldiers was never told in grade school history!  David Morse portraying George Washington was a perfect casting choice!  Various details of the various characters were also revealed in this series.  For example, the founding fathers are always depicted in paintings as having hair, as school childeren, we are told they wore wigs.  But when the founding fathers go to their lodging or home, they took their hair off & hung it, like they did their hats.  That John Adams had a temper, I didn't know previously.  He was a man, like any other man & this series doesn't ""sugar-coat"" his flaws.  In fact each character's flaws as well as their strengths are revealed.  A sad scene was when john went to the home of his son Charles, in a dirty back-street of New York, only to find his son passed-out from booze on his kitchen table.  John shows a little ""tough-love"" to Charles & disowns him right then & there.  Abigail is saddened by this, because he was joy in her life the years John was in France & England.  Another gizzley scene is when a doctor performs a mastectomy on John's daughter ""Nabby"".  The viewer feels as tho she is going to witness a battle-field scene of a limb amputation.  Even the fact that the teeth would be decaying is part of the make-up as the scenes of life progresses.  The genuine love & friendship are also portrayed here.This video set features a sub-program ""facts are stubborn things"", in which various little factoids are displayed like sub-titles through the programs.  These are very interesting, although in somecases, they are not displayed long enough to be read.  In cases like this, I simply ""re-wound"" as I would a vdeo-tape and re-read them.  The first time i watched this series, I din't use that feature.  What is supposed to happen, I think is if the viewer clicks on that factoid, there is supposed to be further information.  Perhaps, viewing the DVDs on my computer will allow that further exploration.  When I attempted to click on it with my TV & DVD player, nothing happened.The only negative things I have to say about this series is the length is a bit too-long, but if it is viewed in segments, as it would have been aired, it's much more comfortable.  And, I had trouble keeping-straight the characters.  What exactly causes the ""rift"" between John Adams & Thomas Jefferson, that lasted for many years is not made clear.  That Abigail's death is the event that leads John to ""touch base"" with Thomas again, reveals that John held grudges for a long time too.I am glad I purchased this video set.  It might be a good reference for junior high or high school papers also.  This video set was purchased used & it was in perfect condition.

1109470,A9L6L5H9BPEBO,B000WGWQG8,Edwin C. Pauzer,"[412, 431]","Each night I turned on the HBO feature anxious to see a good dramatic series, and learn about my country's struggle for life through one its most underrated founding fathers, John Adams.Paul Giamatti's performance in the title role is much in dispute as he, like many other actors, seems to play himself as much as his character. He turns from a loving father to the lawyer and representative who sometimes looks apoplectic rather than just an angry or fiery patriot. Much to his credit, I felt the John Adams of later years on subsequent episodes was extremely well-acted.Abigail Adams is played by Laura Linney, and her performance is superb and not the least in dispute. From the first moment, she is thoroughly credible as the vivacious lover, friend, confidante, advisor, and wife of John Adams. Her acting here should garner her an Emmy. The actors protraying Benjamin Franklin and Thomas Jefferson turned in stellar performances.Many complain that this did not follow the book of the same title, and  was not true to history exactly. To the first query the answer is what does? To the second, it is a well-written and well-acted drama that deserves our attention.The series begins with the Boston Massacre and John Adams representing the British soldiers. With his successful defense, he is noticed by the Crown, as well as the colonials who are striving for independence. Both want his services. Adams chooses independence over the king and we see him as representative, foreign minister, beggar and borrower, ambassador, vice president, and president. His one anchor through these assignments and occupations in the struggle of a new nation is his love and respect for his wife, Abigail whom he always refers to as ""my friend."" The letters between the two is one constant that sustains their love through loneliness of separation, as Mr. Adams is more often away than home.Particularly touching is the drab existence they share in an uncompleted White House, the grief John Adams suffers from the loss of his Abigail, his renewed friendship with Thomas Jefferson, and his dying belief that his friend survives him, even though Jefferson died three hours earlier. In one of the ironies of our history, both men died exactly fifty years to the day, after July 4, 1776.This story ends with both Abigail and John Adams quoting letters of their love for each other and a young nation, as they ascend a hill together and look out over their country. They hope that they will be able to see future generations of Americans, from heaven, and wonder if they will deserve the sacrifice and freedom they have given them.So do I.",5,An Exciting Story,1217376000,"07 30, 2008",2008,2626,"['night', 'turned', 'HBO', 'feature', 'anxious', 'see', 'good', 'dramatic', 'series', 'learn', 'country', 'struggle', 'life', 'one', 'most', 'underrated', 'founding', 'fathers', 'John', 'Adams.Paul', 'Giamatti', 'performance', 'title', 'role', 'much', 'dispute', 'many', 'other', 'actors', 'play', 'as', 'much', 'character', 'loving', 'father', 'lawyer', 'representative', 'who', 'apoplectic', 'rather', 'just', 'angry', 'fiery', 'patriot', 'Much', 'credit', 'felt', 'John', 'Adams', 'later', 'years', 'subsequent', 'episodes', 'was', 'extremely', 'well-acted.Abigail', 'Adams', 'played', 'Laura', 'Linney', 'performance', 'superb', 'not', 'least', 'dispute', 'first', 'moment', 'thoroughly', 'credible', 'vivacious', 'lover', 'friend', 'confidante', 'advisor', 'wife', 'John', 'Adams', 'acting', 'here', 'should', 'garner', 'Emmy', 'actors', 'protraying', 'Benjamin', 'Franklin', 'Thomas', 'Jefferson', 'turned', 'stellar', 'performances.Many', 'complain', 'did', 'not', 'follow', 'book', 'same', 'title', 'was', 'not', 'true', 'history', 'exactly', 'first', 'query', 'answer', 'what', 'second', 'well-written', 'well-acted', 'drama', 'attention.The', 'series', 'Boston', 'Massacre', 'John', 'Adams', 'representing', 'British', 'soldiers', 'successful', 'defense', 'noticed', 'Crown', 'as', 'well', 'colonials', 'who', 'are', 'striving', 'independence', 'want', 'services', 'Adams', 'independence', 'king', 'see', 'representative', 'foreign', 'minister', 'beggar', 'borrower', 'ambassador', 'vice', 'president', 'president', 'one', 'anchor', 'assignments', 'occupations', 'struggle', 'new', 'nation', 'love', 'respect', 'wife', 'Abigail', 'whom', 'always', 'friend', 'letters', 'two', 'one', 'constant', 'love', 'loneliness', 'separation', 'Mr.', 'Adams', 'more', 'often', 'away', 'home.Particularly', 'touching', 'drab', 'existence', 'share', 'uncompleted', 'White', 'House', 'grief', 'John', 'Adams', 'suffers', 'loss', 'Abigail', 'renewed', 'friendship', 'Thomas', 'Jefferson', 'dying', 'belief', 'friend', 'even', 'Jefferson', 'died', 'three', 'hours', 'earlier', 'one', 'ironies', 'history', 'men', 'died', 'exactly', 'fifty', 'years', 'day', 'July', '4', '1776.This', 'story', 'ends', 'Abigail', 'John', 'Adams', 'quoting', 'letters', 'love', 'other', 'young', 'nation', 'ascend', 'hill', 'together', 'look', 'out', 'country', 'hope', 'will', 'be', 'able', 'see', 'future', 'generations', 'Americans', 'heaven', 'wonder', 'will', 'deserve', 'sacrifice', 'freedom', 'have', 'given', 'them.So', 'do']",John Adams

Hernandez ""Call me Harry""","[7, 8]","It was the same for my wife and me, as for some, to look forward with excitement to the next installation of ""John Adams"" on HBO when this originally aired. Take note, when such films are made they are pretty explicit about the fact they are BASED on fact; it is unfair to ever expect fact to get in the way of a good film project. Tom Hanks didn't get invovled with this for nothing!Paul Giamatti gives a brilliant, subtle performance, and it is unjust to say he plays himself instead of Adams. Who can say how Adams ought to be played? Giamatti does, in fact, give an OSCAR-worthy job. Pity he won't get an Oscar for it-- it lifts this from the drab and prosaic bio-flicks of the 1980s and 1990s, along with his great co-stars. Tom Wilkinson is a delight as Ben Franklin, though we see far too little of him. David Morse's George Washington is a marvel of acting, and of makeup.The production values are magnificent, worthy of any film counterpart. The far-from-completed White House is stunning. The script, the dialogue and the interaction is superb, and it simply doesn't get any better than this with a biopic. However, aside from a rare slip probably due to scheduling rushes, this has some major flaws:THE BAD AND THE UGLY ~ I have a HUGE beef with the way this entire thing was shot. I can never understand the stupid, pointless ""up and down"" cinematography, that looks like someone gave a drunk a camcorder. Is that really necessary? My wife and I sometiems become ill if we watch this video for too long a period.This should NEVER be done. It isn't ""Docu-drama"", it isn't ""you-are-there"" cinematography... it is lazy, bowing to passing juvenile tastes in the way indie films are filmed. ADAMS deserves better than that. Watching this film, at times, is worse than sailing without Dramamine, and that should NEVER occur.There is too much of what I consider revolting detail in this film. It is one thing to demonstrate how people may have lived in an era; gross-out tactics, well, that's another thing this film does in excess. Again, all the work gone into this proves the subject, the film and the viewer deserve much better.We were surprised there was no scene with someone using a chamber-pot.Finally, I have a gargantuan gripe about the packaging of this treble dvd set: why on earth do the dvds seem glued into the package? It is what you'd expect: pretty window dressing, mostly cardboard and some nasty, plastic, flimsy dvd-holding mechanism inside. Why do the production companies do this? Even with its faults-- and I took away 2 stars for those I mentioned-- doesn't ADAMS deserve a ""keep case""? YES!It is a mystery what exactly it is that has gotten into movie companies these days, but the crappy outlook is demonstrated by these wretched dvd cases. I own some dvds dating back to 1998, and the cases are marvelous. Nowadays we feel lucky the thing comes in a case of any kind! Why not just shove it in a fancy foil-printed envelope?I actually bruised my thumb removing dvd #2... my favorite sequence of episodes.Shame on the people who design dvd packaging! If you want proper care and preservation of your dvds (which the Smithsonian Institution has proved can last 1,000 years), buy your own cases. And spare me lectures about 'bringing more plastic into the world'. We have excellent, bio-friendly plastic alternatives that are able to more than do the job without anyone grousing about pollution.But I still can't figure out how my DVD collection is adding to any pollution or landfills, unless I count the cheap, disgusting DVD cases that are mostly cardboard anyway! There are several dozens of those I've tossed into the recycling over the years.Now, John Adams would have loved that.",3,"Apoplectic cinematography, shame!",1241913600,"05 10, 2009",2009,3715,"['was', 'same', 'wife', 'look', 'forward', 'excitement', 'next', 'installation', 'John', 'Adams', 'HBO', 'when', 'originally', 'aired', 'Take', 'note', 'when', 'such', 'films', 'are', 'made', 'are', 'pretty', 'explicit', 'fact', 'are', 'BASED', 'fact', 'unfair', 'ever', 'expect', 'fact', 'get', 'way', 'good', 'film', 'project', 'Tom', 'Hanks', 'did', ""n't"", 'get', 'invovled', 'nothing', 'Paul', 'Giamatti', 'brilliant', 'subtle', 'performance', 'unjust', 'say', 'instead', 'Adams', 'Who', 'can', 'say', 'how', 'Adams', 'ought', 'be', 'played', 'Giamatti', 'fact', 'give', 'OSCAR-worthy', 'job', 'Pity', 'wo', ""n't"", 'get', 'Oscar', 'drab', 'prosaic', 'bio-flicks', '1980s', '1990s', 'great', 'co-stars', 'Tom', 'Wilkinson', 'delight', 'Ben', 'Franklin', 'see', 'far', 'too', 'little', 'David', 'Morse', 'George', 'Washington', 'marvel', 'acting', 'makeup.The', 'production', 'values', 'are', 'magnificent', 'worthy', 'film', 'counterpart', 'far-from-completed', 'White', 'House', 'stunning', 'script', 'dialogue', 'interaction', 'superb', 'simply', ""n't"", 'get', 'better', 'biopic', 'However', 'aside', 'rare', 'slip', 'probably', 'due', 'scheduling', 'rushes', 'major', 'flaws', 'BAD', 'THE', 'UGLY', '~', 'have', 'HUGE', 'beef', 'way', 'entire', 'thing', 'was', 'shot', 'can', 'never', 'understand', 'stupid', 'pointless', 'cinematography', 'someone', 'gave', 'drunk', 'camcorder', 'really', 'necessary', 'wife', 'sometiems', 'become', 'ill', 'watch', 'video', 'too', 'long', 'period.This', 'should', 'NEVER', 'be', 'done', ""n't"", 'Docu-drama', ""n't"", 'you-are-there', 'cinematography', 'lazy', 'bowing', 'passing', 'juvenile', 'tastes', 'way', 'indie', 'films', 'are', 'filmed', 'ADAMS', 'better', 'Watching', 'film', 'times', 'worse', 'sailing', 'Dramamine', 'should', 'NEVER', 'too', 'much', 'what', 'consider', 'revolting', 'detail', 'film', 'one', 'thing', 'demonstrate', 'how', 'people', 'may', 'have', 'lived', 'era', 'gross-out', 'tactics', 'well', 'thing', 'film', 'excess', 'Again', 'work', 'gone', 'subject', 'film', 'viewer', 'deserve', 'much', 'better.We', 'were', 'surprised', 'was', 'scene', 'someone', 'using', 'chamber-pot.Finally', 'have', 'gargantuan', 'gripe', 'packaging', 'treble', 'dvd', 'set', 'why', 'earth', 'do', 'dvds', 'seem', 'glued', 'package', 'what', ""'d"", 'expect', 'pretty', 'dressing', 'mostly', 'cardboard', 'nasty', 'plastic', 'flimsy', 'dvd-holding', 'mechanism', 'Why', 'do', 'production', 'companies', 'do', 'Even', 'faults', 'took', 'away', '2', 'stars', 'mentioned', ""n't"", 'ADAMS', 'deserve', 'keep', 'case', 'YES', 'mystery', 'what', 'gotten', 'movie', 'companies', 'days', 'crappy', 'outlook', 'demonstrated', 'wretched', 'dvd', 'cases', 'own', 'dvds', 'dating', 'back', '1998', 'cases', 'are', 'marvelous', 'feel', 'lucky', 'thing', 'case', 'kind', 'Why', 'not', 'just', 'shove', 'fancy', 'foil-printed', 'envelope', 'actually', 'bruised', 'thumb', 'removing', 'dvd', '2', 'favorite', 'sequence', 'episodes.Shame', 'people', 'who', 'design', 'dvd', 'packaging', 'want', 'proper', 'care', 'preservation', 'dvds', 'Smithsonian', 'Institution', 'proved', 'can', 'last', '1,000', 'years', 'buy', 'own', 'cases', 'spare', ""'bringing"", 'more', 'plastic', 'world', 'have', 'excellent', 'bio-friendly', 'plastic', 'alternatives', 'are', 'able', 'more', 'do', 'job', 'anyone', 'grousing', 'pollution.But', 'still', 'ca', ""n't"", 'figure', 'out', 'how', 'DVD', 'collection', 'adding', 'pollution', 'landfills', 'count', 'cheap', 'disgusting', 'DVD', 'cases', 'are', 'mostly', 'cardboard', 'anyway', 'are', 'several', 'dozens', ""'ve"", 'tossed', 'recycling', 'years.Now', 'John', 'Adams', 'would', 'have', 'loved']",John Adams

We didn't want to skip a night.It's all good, but the earlier episodes are better than the later ones. Why? I felt too much was skipped during the last few parts. Too many gaps. Naturally some events would have to be left out or the series would be 40 hours. Yet, it would have been better for them to narrow the focus on his earlier career.In the final three parts it was hard to get a feel for the scope of what was going on in the country -- it became more of a personal story. And even in that context, it was hard to get a sense of all the big national events that were affecting John and Abigail personally, outside of family affairs. During John's presidency, I don't recall seeing any Congressional sessions, speeches, or proper cabinet meetings. If there were, they are minor.Did the series capture John's and Abigail's character? As much as I know from my limited reading, yes, probably fairly well. I was surprised by the magisterial manner of Jefferson as portrayed here. His overwhelming sense of calm and thoughtful genius was appealing. I haven't read in detail enough about Jefferson to say if that was accurate. He had a great passion for art, collecting books, and of course architecture. But that passion does not seem to be evident in this portrayal. He's almost disturbingly Mr. Spock-like in emotional restraint.The intrigues and battles between Jefferson as Vice-President when Adams succeeded Washington as President are given relatively small notice, as is the Sedition Act. Adams did start a navy and avoided entaglement with a European war. Most of the events of his single term are seen from the dreary setting of a still-under-construction White House in Washington, D.C.Picky points:Many famous quotes of the founding fathers are included in this series, not always in the context of which they actually uttered them.The artificial aging makeup or lack of it, and the inconsistency of it, was a bit disconcerting. Sometimes John looked older in one scene, then younger in the next. This was handled poorly, and I don't know why, given today's state of the art. Neither John nor Abigail appear to age naturally. The bad dental work, pus, vomit, bloodlettings and barbaric surgery of the 18th century are represented with some realism, though, for what that's worth, plus the excessive facial makeup the French nobles (including men) used. Marcel Marceau would have fit right in.In spite of these caveats, the miniseries is compelling. It's no substitute for David McCullough's book, though. Additionally, I'm not sure about replay value. I was enthusiastic about it while I was watching it, but now I wonder if I will want to see it twice.",4,An outstanding first half...,1217894400,"08 5, 2008",2008,2750,"['are', 'seven', 'parts', 'DVD', 'HBO', 'miniseries', 'watched', 'seven', 'nights', 'did', ""n't"", 'want', 'skip', 'night.It', 'good', 'earlier', 'episodes', 'are', 'better', 'later', 'ones', 'Why', 'felt', 'too', 'much', 'was', 'skipped', 'last', 'few', 'parts', 'Too', 'many', 'gaps', 'Naturally', 'events', 'would', 'have', 'be', 'left', 'out', 'series', 'would', 'be', '40', 'hours', 'Yet', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'better', 'narrow', 'focus', 'earlier', 'career.In', 'final', 'three', 'parts', 'was', 'hard', 'get', 'feel', 'scope', 'what', 'was', 'going', 'country', 'became', 'more', 'personal', 'story', 'even', 'context', 'was', 'hard', 'get', 'sense', 'big', 'national', 'events', 'were', 'affecting', 'John', 'Abigail', 'personally', 'family', 'affairs', 'John', 'presidency', 'do', ""n't"", 'recall', 'seeing', 'Congressional', 'sessions', 'speeches', 'proper', 'cabinet', 'meetings', 'were', 'are', 'minor.Did', 'series', 'capture', 'John', 'Abigail', 'character', 'As', 'much', 'know', 'limited', 'reading', 'yes', 'probably', 'fairly', 'well', 'was', 'surprised', 'magisterial', 'manner', 'Jefferson', 'portrayed', 'here', 'overwhelming', 'sense', 'calm', 'thoughtful', 'genius', 'was', 'appealing', 'have', ""n't"", 'read', 'detail', 'enough', 'Jefferson', 'say', 'was', 'accurate', 'had', 'great', 'passion', 'art', 'collecting', 'books', 'course', 'architecture', 'passion', 'not', 'seem', 'be', 'evident', 'portrayal', 'almost', 'disturbingly', 'Mr.', 'Spock-like', 'emotional', 'restraint.The', 'intrigues', 'battles', 'Jefferson', 'Vice-President', 'when', 'Adams', 'succeeded', 'Washington', 'President', 'are', 'given', 'relatively', 'small', 'notice', 'Sedition', 'Act', 'Adams', 'did', 'start', 'navy', 'avoided', 'entaglement', 'European', 'war', 'Most', 'events', 'single', 'term', 'are', 'seen', 'dreary', 'setting', 'still-under-construction', 'White', 'House', 'Washington', 'D.C.Picky', 'points', 'Many', 'famous', 'quotes', 'founding', 'fathers', 'are', 'included', 'series', 'not', 'always', 'context', 'actually', 'uttered', 'them.The', 'artificial', 'aging', 'makeup', 'lack', 'inconsistency', 'was', 'bit', 'disconcerting', 'Sometimes', 'John', 'looked', 'older', 'one', 'scene', 'then', 'younger', 'next', 'was', 'handled', 'poorly', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'why', 'given', 'today', 'state', 'art', 'John', 'Abigail', 'appear', 'age', 'naturally', 'bad', 'dental', 'work', 'pus', 'vomit', 'bloodlettings', 'barbaric', 'surgery', '18th', 'century', 'are', 'represented', 'realism', 'though', 'what', 'worth', 'excessive', 'facial', 'makeup', 'French', 'nobles', 'including', 'men', 'used', 'Marcel', 'Marceau', 'would', 'have', 'fit', 'right', 'in.In', 'spite', 'caveats', 'miniseries', 'compelling', 'substitute', 'David', 'McCullough', 'book', 'though', 'Additionally', ""'m"", 'not', 'sure', 'replay', 'value', 'was', 'enthusiastic', 'was', 'watching', 'now', 'wonder', 'will', 'want', 'see', 'twice']",John Adams
1109478,A2IS16K96YSFDV,B000WGWQG8,Eric Mayforth,"[2, 2]","This towering miniseries, based on David McCullough's biography of John Adams, tells the story of one of our Founding Fathers and our second president.The miniseries begins in 1770, when Adams agreed to serve as counsel for British soldiers following the Boston Massacre.  Adams was a leader in uniting the various sections of the colonies for independence from Great Britain.  One of the most poignant scenes in the entire miniseries was the one in which the delegates to the Second Continental Congress voted to issue the Declaration of Independence, and then seemed shocked that they had done so--they must have known how extremely difficult and costly it would be to make the new Declaration stick.Adams then was ambassador to France, the Netherlands, and England, and the miniseries shows the toll that his absence took on his family life.After the Constitution was ratified, he was elected the nation's first vice president and was frustrated in that role.  In 1796, Adams was elected president.  Relations with France were a large part of what Adams dealt with during his presidency--he became very unpopular after the passage of the Alien and Sedition Acts, which were passed in 1798 in response to the XYZ Affair and Quasi War.This miniseries accurately portrays the buildings that people lived in and daily objects used by people during our country's founding.  Life was very hard then (there is graphic portrayal of ghastly late eighteenth/early nineteenth century medical techniques--be grateful that you live now and not then).  John and Abigail were the first couple to live in the White House--they moved in just before Adams was defeated in his bid for reelection by Thomas Jefferson in the 1800 presidential election.  The portrayal of Washington D.C. as simply the nearly empty, unfurnished White House and a couple of other buildings in the midst of a bunch of mud and forests serves as another reminder of just how young the country was at the turn of the nineteenth century.In his later years, Adams revived his friendship with Thomas Jefferson.  Adams and Jefferson, two of our most important Founders, died within hours of each other on July 4, 1826, fifty years to the day after the Declaration of Independence was issued.  No Hollywood scriptwriter would have ever dared script that scenario!Some of the bonus features on the DVD set include ""Facts Are Stubborn Things"", which provides subtitles that add background information (this feature can be viewed or not viewed while watching the miniseries); ""The Making of John Adams"", which provides information on the special effects and sets in the miniseries; and there is also a feature on David McCullough's work as a historian.The miniseries is a reminder of the high price that Adams and the rest of the Founding generation paid for our independence and demonstrates how grateful we should be for their bravery and sacrifices.",5,A Towering Miniseries About America's Founding,1215129600,"07 4, 2008",2008,2903,"['towering', 'miniseries', 'based', 'David', 'McCullough', 'biography', 'John', 'Adams', 'story', 'one', 'Founding', 'Fathers', 'second', 'president.The', 'miniseries', '1770', 'when', 'Adams', 'agreed', 'serve', 'counsel', 'British', 'soldiers', 'following', 'Boston', 'Massacre', 'Adams', 'was', 'leader', 'uniting', 'various', 'sections', 'colonies', 'independence', 'Great', 'Britain', 'One', 'most', 'poignant', 'scenes', 'entire', 'miniseries', 'was', 'one', 'delegates', 'Second', 'Continental', 'Congress', 'voted', 'issue', 'Declaration', 'Independence', 'then', 'seemed', 'shocked', 'had', 'done', 'so', 'must', 'have', 'known', 'how', 'extremely', 'difficult', 'costly', 'would', 'be', 'make', 'new', 'Declaration', 'stick.Adams', 'then', 'was', 'ambassador', 'France', 'Netherlands', 'England', 'miniseries', 'toll', 'absence', 'took', 'family', 'Constitution', 'was', 'ratified', 'was', 'elected', 'nation', 'first', 'vice', 'president', 'was', 'frustrated', 'role', '1796', 'Adams', 'was', 'elected', 'president', 'Relations', 'France', 'were', 'large', 'part', 'what', 'Adams', 'dealt', 'presidency', 'became', 'very', 'unpopular', 'passage', 'Alien', 'Sedition', 'Acts', 'were', 'passed', '1798', 'response', 'XYZ', 'Affair', 'Quasi', 'War.This', 'accurately', 'buildings', 'people', 'lived', 'daily', 'objects', 'used', 'people', 'country', 'founding', 'Life', 'was', 'very', 'hard', 'then', 'graphic', 'portrayal', 'ghastly', 'late', 'eighteenth/early', 'nineteenth', 'century', 'medical', 'techniques', 'be', 'grateful', 'live', 'now', 'not', 'then', 'John', 'Abigail', 'were', 'first', 'couple', 'live', 'White', 'House', 'moved', 'just', 'Adams', 'was', 'defeated', 'bid', 'reelection', 'Thomas', 'Jefferson', '1800', 'presidential', 'election', 'portrayal', 'Washington', 'D.C.', 'simply', 'nearly', 'empty', 'unfurnished', 'White', 'House', 'couple', 'other', 'buildings', 'midst', 'bunch', 'mud', 'serves', 'reminder', 'just', 'how', 'young', 'country', 'was', 'turn', 'nineteenth', 'century.In', 'later', 'years', 'Adams', 'revived', 'friendship', 'Thomas', 'Jefferson', 'Adams', 'Jefferson', 'two', 'most', 'important', 'Founders', 'died', 'hours', 'other', 'July', '4', '1826', 'fifty', 'years', 'day', 'Declaration', 'Independence', 'was', 'issued', 'Hollywood', 'scriptwriter', 'would', 'have', 'ever', 'dared', 'script', 'scenario', 'bonus', 'DVD', 'set', 'include', 'Facts', 'Are', 'Stubborn', 'Things', 'subtitles', 'add', 'background', 'information', 'feature', 'can', 'be', 'viewed', 'not', 'viewed', 'watching', 'miniseries', 'Making', 'John', 'Adams', 'information', 'special', 'effects', 'sets', 'miniseries', 'also', 'feature', 'David', 'McCullough', 'work', 'historian.The', 'miniseries', 'reminder', 'high', 'price', 'Adams', 'rest', 'Founding', 'generation', 'paid', 'independence', 'how', 'grateful', 'should', 'be', 'bravery', 'sacrifices']",John Adams
1109479,A2GA2SO3YK6CXI,B000WGWQG8,"Esperanza Reynolds ""Hope Reynolds""","[1, 1]","This HBO miniseries provides the opportunity to learn how the United States of America was initiated. We are Cuban-Americans and do not necessarily know all the details of how it all happened, so we acquired John Adams and have simply had an eye-opening experience as to life in the 1700's.The benefits of owning DVDs are interesting:1. Special features provide selection of sub-titles so we do not miss a word spoken2. Several languages are offered and to see John Adams with family members that do not speak English, we choose spoken Spanish with Spanish subtitles3. Special features and added bonus material provide invaluable information as to how the movie is madeJohn Adams, masterfully played by Paul Giamatti, was an attorney of modest origin who studied and worked hard to become one of the most learned and thoughtful men of his time.He was born on October 30th, 1735 in Braintree, Massachusetts to John, a farmer and Susanna Adams, who as he says during the series ""could hardly read"" and yet, thanks to his tenacity of purpose and dedication to learning, he became an attorney, then a key member of the revolutionary group, was assigned to represent them in France and Holland, became ambassador to Great Britain, the first Vice President and later President of the United States.Life in the 1700's was difficult and these men lived under the tyranny of Britain, enduring heavy taxation that made them struggle to survive. During the first few scenes we see a people, tired and cold. They confront the militia, causing them to fire upon a crowd, for the most part made up of simple family men and children.These members of the militia and their captain are accused of murder and because no one else would take to their defense, Mr. Adams is asked to represent them. Astutely, he wins their acquittal but the whole town sees him as defender of the crown. His courage to defend the truth at the cost of losing popularity and his clientele gains him the respect of the townspeople who identify in him the qualities necessary for the patriot cause and he soon becomes a member of the first and second continental congress, becoming integral part of the leadership that guides the 13 colonies to independence.A Harvard-educated lawyer; John Adams is eloquent, well read, articulate, and as his wife says, prone to write words that demonstrate his amazing vocabulary and oratory, rather than displaying a simple writing style that can be understood by the populace.During the early episodes, we see many terrible things take place, but throughout it all, John Adams endeavors to keep every one on the course of total respect of the law, surfacing the rights of every man to live free, healthy lives.John Adams becomes a friend of George Washington and submits his name as the ideal candidate to lead the forces to independence for ""being the tallest man at every meeting,"" George Washington is without a doubt the most noticed of all participants.When the revolution starts, John Adams is sent to France and also to Holland as a diplomat in the hopes that with his eloquent oratory, he be able to obtain the financial support necessary to withstand the costs of the revolutionary war and to negotiate the peace treaty.Played by Laura Linney, Abigail is John Adams' brilliant wife, his confidant, counsel, and his constructive critic. She comes across as observant, intelligent, capable, hard-working, witty and with clarity of thought that helps John Adams keep his course throughout the struggle. The couple is often separated by the events taking place and while John Adams is in Pennsylvania, Abigail is alone with the children and working hard to support the family. When John Adams is sent abroad, Abigail insists that he be accompanied by their oldest son, John Quincy Adams. She wants her son to see the world and to learn from exposure to other cultures. This astute career planning plants the seed for the young Adams to later aspire to become a lawyer like his father and run for president of the United States.When the United States wins against Britain, John Adams is assigned ambassador to the Court of St. James. He meets the king and the exchange of words between the two is worthy of rewinding and seeing a few times, for Mr. Adams's choice of words, manner, and honesty gain him the respect of the monarch.Upon his return to the United States, John Adams receives a hero's welcome and we seen him involved with government. He becomes the first Vice President of the USA, a position that is frustrating because, in his words: ""his country has contrived for him the most insignificant office that ever the invention of man had conceived."" Throughout the vice presidency assignment, we witness the perennial frustration experienced by this great man because his job, for the most part, is to listen to men debate ideas, without an ability to run the show.John Adams becomes President and on the day of his inaugural speech George Washington tells him: ""I am out and you are in, let's see who is happiest now.""Finally, when his term as President is over, he retires to his farm to live with his family, enduring personal tragedy. One of our favorite passages to this series is the debate that takes place while writing the preamble to the constitution of the USA, where Thomas Jefferson, Benjamin Franklin and John Adams debate the words: ""We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness.""If you want to learn history, feel as if you lived during those days, and broaden your interpretation of the times that forged the personalities of our founding fathers, do not miss this great miniseries.

1109480,A15BHDNAUEBEKP,B000WGWQG8,Evelina,"[38, 60]","Just how false can the makers of this film be to the vision of the McCullough book? They do a very good job of rejecting the author's vision and replacing it with their own anti American anti western counterculture vision. McCullough did not write a fairy tale. He gave us Adams and others with their faults. But he also showed their greatness. His book is optimistic and life affirming.  The movie is unfailingly negative. In the end, the viewer is left with a feeling of dissatisfaction. This is not a great story. It is a sad story of aimless unhappy confused misled people who accomplished little.It is instructive to compare John Adams with the King's Speech, also directed by Tom Hooper.  The latter is hagiographic in its presentation of the King. No dissenting voice is raised, whether in regard to the colonial properties, the royal family's propensity towards extreme right wing beliefs, including Hitlerism (later they came around to the proper way of thinking), the class system, the depression, the high unemployment and poverty that existed in Great Britain in the thirties.  We are given a perfectly loving royal family with nothing but the most positive feelings within the family and without. The very conservative virtue of Duty is emphasized. Edward is wrong in neglecting his Duty to his country. Nothing is said about whether it is reasonable to make a king abdicate simply because he wants to marry a divorced woman. It is Tradition that the Queen not be a divorcee and Tradition is good. I do not object to Hooper taking a wholly positive view of the royal family or 1930s Britain. He is not obligated to show warts. I do object to his taking a totally contrary viewpoint towards the US, a nothing but warts vision. The Duty we are shown in John Adams is not sacred. It is at best questionable and at worst just dumb.Just as the King and Queen had a famously happy marriage, so did John and Abigail.  John Adams comes close to saying otherwise. Abigail and John do not seem to get much joy from being together. Abigail is made to bear a modern day feminist anger and at John and America. She looks sour most of the time as though already saturated with the Culture of Resentment. There seems little affection between them. So those few times, when they act like they like each other, it is puzzling. Where are these sentiments coming from? On her deathbed, Abigail remarks sourly that she did not think he would outlive her. A woman like Abigail, religious, puritanical, principled, would have died reconciled to her God and her life. And she loved John. I do not believe for a moment that she had any such thought as the movie indicates. The happiness of the union is disregarded as is the happiness of creating a new nation.As a husband and a father, John Adams is continually put down. One of his children became an alcoholic and another made a marriage to an irresponsible husband. We are told this is somehow Adams' fault.  His children do not seem to like him. There is no evidence for this in history.  In fact, although the Adams were disappointed at times in their children, they also loved them dearly and cared for them and supported those who needed it as adults, and their grandchildren. Yet the movie takes the most negative attitude towards the family.  I suppose we must thank providence that the movie makers controlled themselves to the extent of refraining from showing Adams starving his children or molesting his daughter.  The movie is careful not to let John Quincy show any affection for his father. When a letter by Jefferson congratulating Adams on having a son who becomes president is read aloud, we get a close up of the son shaking his head in disgust as though God forbid, the father should take any pride in the son. We are told that Adams refused to help his son in law find employment. This is not true. Adams did help him many times. Nor did Adams force the husband to leave the wife, as the movie implies. When the daughter is diagnosed with breast cancer, Abigail without a look at her husband leaves the room. They do not comfort each other is the implication. They have a cold relationship. This is not true.The tenor of the movie is sour and nasty. The creation of the US seems a bad thing. The Founding Fathers seem bad. There is no attempt to balance as in the book, the good and the bad. Everyone, including the Adams, seems in a permanent state of misery or bad temper. The exception is Thomas Jefferson, who maintains an attitude of contemptuous and superior detachment, of which the move wholeheartedly approves.The portrayal of Jefferson reveals a great deal about the movie makers' intentions. Jefferson takes a radical view in regard to the French Revolution, applauding the overthrow of the entire old order and the violence directed at the French royal family and the aristocrats. He says that every once in a while there should be upheavals, riots, and bloodshed. Adams expresses dismay at mob rule. The scene is written so that Jefferson appears right and Adams wrong. Jefferson sounds like a modern day leftwinger so the film approves him.  In the scenes with Abigail, she seems to like Jefferson more than she likes her husband. She smiles at him continually and seems happier in his company.  One scene has her admiringly showing Adams the plans for Jefferson's Monticello. Later, when Abigail and John move into the White House, she remarks sourly that no good can come of a house built by slaves. Yet, Monticello was built by slaves. At one time, Jefferson owned as many as 700 African Americans and he never freed a slave. I kept on waiting for someone to point that out, but no one even utters even the mildest, oh, what about his slaves? Adams, on the other hand, was anti slavery and kept none. But Jefferson is shown to be more freedom loving than Adams.In the end, we are asked to believe that Adams ended his days miserable and disappointed. It is true that politics made him miserable. He had not the ability to make himself the favorite of diverse men. Yet he did not view his life work as a waste. He was proud of it. He had love and hope in his new nation. He was surrounded by his children and grandchildren and his loving and loved Abigail, until she died. He lived to see his son become president and was rightfully proud. The movie presents the US, his life, as something bad.In the past, movies glorified our past and ignored faults, wrongly, you could argue. But the modern day negativity and nastiness is worse.",1,"a very unfair, ridiculously gloomy hateful picture of John Adams and early America",1309392000,"06 30, 2011",2011,6510,"['Just', 'how',

Some others have apparently found it dark, but life in those times was difficult and a struggle even for those well placed in society and these moments are well presented.

This series certainly places him on an equal standing. The script is intelligent, very well crafted and holds your attention throughout.The series is overall, beautifully shot with some frames simply stunning in the detail of the period.  The scene where Adams confronts the Dutch hierarchy is one that Rembrandt would heartily approve of and is worthy of framing. And other shots of interiors and lighting that would delight the Dutch painter Vermeer.  (Some clumsy handheld camera shots in the earlier part of the series and some awkward angled shots elsewhere can therefore be forgiven.)The BluRay transfer is outstanding in 16:9 displaying incredible detail and the producers have thankfully limited makeup to look natural in this Hi-def format except of course for the French Court that showed how outlandish they looked in reality, not long incidentally before many of them literally lost there heads in the French Revolution.I give it a definite 5/5, an absolute delight to watch.",5,Outstanding Series in BluRay format,1248566400,"07 26, 2009",2009,1374,"['undoubtable', 'one', 'best', 'series', 'be', 'presented', 'HBO', 'others', 'have', 'apparently', 'found', 'dark', 'life', 'times', 'was', 'difficult', 'struggle', 'even', 'well', 'placed', 'society', 'moments', 'are', 'well', 'presented', 'John', 'Adams', 'achieved', 'great', 'deal', 'yet', 'American', 'history', 'world', 'not', 'as', 'well', 'known', 'Washington', 'Franklin', 'Jefferson', 'series', 'certainly', 'equal', 'standing', 'script', 'intelligent', 'very', 'well', 'crafted', 'attention', 'throughout.The', 'series', 'overall', 'beautifully', 'shot', 'frames', 'simply', 'stunning', 'detail', 'period', 'scene', 'where', 'Adams', 'Dutch', 'hierarchy', 'one', 'Rembrandt', 'would', 'heartily', 'approve', 'worthy', 'framing', 'other', 'shots', 'interiors', 'lighting', 'would', 'delight', 'Dutch', 'painter', 'Vermeer', 'clumsy', 'handheld', 'camera', 'shots', 'earlier', 'part', 'series', 'awkward', 'angled', 'shots', 'elsewhere', 'can', 'therefore', 'be', 'forgiven', 'BluRay', 'transfer', 'outstanding', '16:9', 'displaying', 'incredible', 'detail', 'producers', 'have', 'thankfully', 'limited', 'makeup', 'look', 'natural', 'Hi-def', 'format', 'course', 'French', 'Court', 'showed', 'how', 'outlandish', 'looked', 'reality', 'not', 'long', 'incidentally', 'before', 'many', 'literally', 'lost', 'heads', 'French', 'Revolution.I', 'give', 'definite', '5/5', 'absolute', 'delight', 'watch']",John Adams

1109490,A1UYL5GIQ8YE77,B000WGWQG8,Fred L. Houpt,"[1, 1]","I chose both J & A in my summary because one without the other would not have succeeded in the deep and profound lives they lived. First of all a sober assessment of this film should be put aside until one has read David McCullough's fantastic historical account of J.A. The reader is entertained by a master storyteller, who first caught my ear in the ever great Ken Burns series ""The Civil War"", where he was used as narrator and historian. Once you have read this book then the many facts that you face when watching the film will make all the more sense.Why is J.A. such a great series? The producers and director took great pains to reproduce the look and feel, the authenticity of the times. (my one and only criticism of this and just about every such series is that costumes, especially of the soldiers all look like they were just freshly pressed and taken from the closet. Soldiers of the day had no such luxury and probably looked pretty shabby, notwithstanding the bright colours. But I quibble....) The overall view is the impression that we are looking at the times as they really were. What I noted in particular was the extreme hazards of a winter time boat crossing of the Atlantic !!!! Good heavens, I can think of few things at that time or our own that were more perilous and as we watch poor J.A. wretchedly sick as the boat crashes upon the waves....we tremble at their fate. Never mind that they had to fight a pitched battle against a British ship....and could have been sunk themselves.John Adams was a complex man but a very good and moral one. Bull headed when he dug in his heels, opinionated, erudite, hard working, a devoted and loving father and husband. All of his life's energies he channelled through the filter that was his beloved wife, Abigail. John trusted no other human as much as his Abigail. They say that they had one of the great love and literary affairs of the century. If the volume of correspondence and the expressions therein are adequate testimony, then we witness a true love. John was both a farmer, scholar and lawyer, something not seen much in our time. He was also guided by a simple but iron willed principle that all men must be governed by laws and that society that abandons them opens itself up to the rule of the mob. Early in his life he is tested as he is given the thankless task of defending British soldiers who stood accused of killing several colonists. His uneasy but fierce and successful defence of the soldiers gives us an idea of the depth of this man. He was to be tested over and over again as he was torn away from wife and children to tend to national duties as they rapidly evolved. There was not a single time that he did not gain his wife's blessings to his paths, no matter the pain it caused her.The series quite accurately tells their story. From the incredibly difficult days where he was away in Philadelphia helping hammer out the declaration of independence while sickness and the British forces gave his wife and children many sleepless nights to the even more wrenching times when John was alone in Europe trying with great vexation to motivate French and Dutch bankers and royalty to support the erupting American revolution. The series shows the physical depredations he lived through and the mentally trying decision to send his young son John Quincy off to St. Petersburg as a diplomatic assistant.The ensemble cast is superb from top to bottom. Much detail is given to making the actors appear as close to the historical characters. While they had no photography back then they certainly had plenty of portrait painters and we know pretty much what they looked like. David Morse's depiction of Washington was almost inch for inch what he would have looked like, the actor being as tall as Washington was. As well it is known that Washington's teeth had been removed or came out and that he wore ivory dentures. Look at all the stuffing in Morse's mouth and the attempt to reproduce the generals face is all there.While there is so much tragedy in the Adams family, with the loss of a daughter to cancer and a son to alcoholism, the most shattering moment comes when John watches his wife slip away. Such very great people you cannot find much in the historical record. I still must say that I find Thomas Jefferson one of the most vile of the founding fathers. A prosperous, brilliant, urbane, conniving, calculating and charming man who simply could not see his pleasures and wealth compromised by ever giving up his slaves, of which it now appears that he fathered a number of children; I find him personally disgusting. Give me John Adams and the manner in which he was a father, a husband, a Vice and President of the United States. When all is said and done, this is one of those very great series that should be mandatory in every American school system.The chemistry between Laura Linney and Paul Giamatti is composed of a wealth of excellent dialogue, quotes from their huge output of letters to each other and by the unbreakable bonds of love. Clearly these actors felt a sympathy for these founders and were able to channel their spirit with such clarity. Tom Wilkinson's depiction of Dr. Benjamin Franklin is wonderful to behold. Watch for the hilarious chess game played in the bathtub. As I am watching the series all over again it motivates me to re-read McCullough's book. Both are treasures you should own and learn from.",5,John and Abigail Adams: patriots and heroes,1265068800,"02 2, 2010",2010,5433,"['chose', 'J', 'A', 'summary', 'one', 'other', 'would', 'not',

1109509,A3ML2HRDE3PY5I,B000WGWQG8,Hikari,"[1, 1]","As a student, my sum total of knowledge about our second President was just that--he was our second President, and, oh yeah, he signed the Declaration of Independence.  Now along comes this ground-breaking HBO project to rectify that injustice and hopefully ensure that future generations of American history students will learn more about this fascinating and sadly-underrated founder of our nation.  What I find more interesting than the thousands of laudatory reviews is the vocal minority of those who hated this project.  They have some valid points, from a production standpoint, but the underlying worthiness of this project cannot be marginalized by stylistic quibbles.  Let's be completely honest--despite the many excellent biographies in print about John Adams (my library alone has more than half a dozen), David McCollough's Pulitzer Prize winning entry upon which this series is based among them, how many Americans have actually read a John Adams biography, or are likely to in their lifetimes?  For better or worse, we live in a cinematic age and millions have already watched this program in broadcast; millions more like myself saw it on DVD, and it is framed and edited in such a way as to make it ideal for showing in public schools as part of our woefully inadequate civics curriculum.  I don't delude myself into thinking that the average American high school would devote a full seven hours of precious instructional time to `John Adams', but for those who are of a mind to, parts of this miniseries will engage even the most apathetic teenage student of history.  Why?  Because it's all fresh.  We've had ad nauseum renderings of Washington crossing the Delaware; students know all about the Boston Tea Party and the ride of Paul Revere . . .but here is a patch of revolutionary American history the spotlight has not shone on before.  The first disc in particular has scenes that absolutely thrill one to be an American.  Later episodes do tend to suffer from a lack of dramatic tension and I don't deny that large chunks of Adams' life are skipped over, including what must have been many happy events, in favor of focusing on Adams' political disappointments and personal tragedies.  There is no way a seven-hour series could hope to do justice to a life that spanned 91 years, but the filmmakers give it a fair shot.  As is fitting, greater detail is paid to Adams' contributions as a statesman and architect of the Revolution than is given to later years when personal sorrow, vocational disillusionment and infirmity came to Adams as they do to us all.Paul Giamatti and Laura Linney as John and Abigail Adams seem to both inspire a `love `em or hate `em' sentiment among viewers.  Most agree that Giamatti and Linney inhabit and give life to this long-gone power couple as though they were born to play them.  The cranky minority dimisses both performances as stilted, ridiculous and unconvincing.  For me, Linney disappeared more easily into the role of Abigail; I had a longer job of it to forget Miles from `Sideways' (the role I feel Giamatti was REALLY born to play) and see him as John Adams, though I have to say that all the actors received incomparable support for their performances from the outstanding costume and makeup design.  Giamatti at 41 is the exact age Adams was during the First Continental Congress, and he is aged believably throughout the production.  Giamatti may not have Adams' Yankee features or diction, but he does suggest Adams in stature, who was a short, physically unimpressive man, derided in the Senate over which he presided as `His Rotundity'.I learned that men shaved their heads under those fancy wigs until a certain mature age, after which time they were content to grow in their own scraggly natural hair and wear it long instead.  And I give daily thanks for the state of dental care in 2008 when seeing the ravages of a lifetime without dental hygiene in the 18th century could do to a mouth.  The supporting cast is all breathtakingly good, though most of the roles other than the Adamses are regrettably brief.  David Morse, wearing what looks to be uncomfortable dental prostheses that make his chin look funny is the very picture of the older George Washington.  Tom Wilkinson gets to have arguably the most fun of anyone as the elderly yet randy curmudgeon Ben Franklin, and he looks fantastic as well.  Stephen Dillane has a tricky role as Thomas Jefferson, Adams' lifelong friend and political rival.  At 52, he is nearly 20 years older than Jefferson was when he penned the Declaration, and cannot pass for a natural redhead in any light, making his characterization rather awkward in the early scenes.  However, as Jefferson ages, Dillane grows into the performance, presenting the urbane Jefferson in a rather unflattering light as a Machiavellian political schemer, the yang to Adams' yin.  Interesting yet truncated turns by Danny Huston as John's cousin, Sam Adams (brewer and patriot) and Rufus Sewell as Alexander Hamilton made me lament that there was not enough time or budget to include more of their narratives.  Otherwise an episode devoted to the Revolution through Sam Adams' eyes, or the famous duel between Hamilton and Aaron Burr would have been welcome.But the name of this series is `John Adams', and he rightly occupies center stage here.  Adams' lone term as President was not a smashing success; he was a polarizing figure who was neither handsome, compelling in leadership nor possessing the aristocratic polish of Jefferson or Washington.  He was, and was proud to be, a plain-spoken son of New England farmers.  But this humble background put him out of step with many of his peers, and though bright and capable, he lacked the gifts of oratory, facility with foreign languages or ability to think in sweeping abstractions which were characteristic of many of his co-founders.  His very pragmatic (and dogmatic) cast of mind made him a disaster as a diplomat in the heavily ritualized European courts, in which he spent years.  At home he was destined to be sandwiched between and overshadowed throughout his career by two more charismatic and larger-than-life figures, one who preceeded him in the office of the Presidency and the other who succeeded him.  And yet Adams is as every bit as deserving as Washington or Jefferson to be called the architect of our Republic.  As the mini-series shows, it was Adams who persuaded Washington to helm the Continental Army; it was Adams who commissioned Jefferson to write the Declaration, realizing that his own pen was not up to the task; and it was Adams' zeal as the leader of the Massachusetts delegation which won over several larger and more influential Tory states in the bid for declaring war with England.  Without John Adams, there most likely would not have been a successful Revolution.  This mini-series, though not perfect, showed me that, and has done a service to Adams' memory and to every American.  Highly recommended.",4,Little Big Man,1216166400,"07 16, 2008",2008,6990,"['student', 'sum', 'total', 'knowledge', 'second', 'President', 'was', 'just', 'was', 'second', 'President', 'oh', 'yeah',

1109514,A1Q8ZB0G22V6YA,B000WGWQG8,Iain S. Palin,"[3, 3]","A pro-American Brit reviews the series:A few years ago I set a quiz which included the question ""Who was the second President of the United States"". Nobody, not even a visiting American got the answer - which seems to sum up John Adams' position in history. Certainly before I watched this fascinating HBO miniseries I knew nothing of the man: now I feel I don't just know about him, I have a much better grasp on his times.Adams was a Boston lawyer who sympathised with the grievances of his fellow-colonists but not all of their activities. His desire to see justice done led him to defend - successfully - the British soldiers accused of murder following the so-called Boston Massacre, but he was canny enough not to accept the Crown preferment offered to him after the trial. He was a delegate to the Continental Congresses that discussed and finally decided on declaring American independence, a move he promoted, and he became an active spokesman for the new United States.He certainly wasn't perfect - his courtroom performance tended to long-windedness unless his sensible wife had toned his speeches down in preparation, and when sent to Europe to rally support for the Americans in their War of Independence he proved undiplomatic and not very successful. But his prominence and activities meant he came second to George Washington in the first US presidential election and therefore served as his Vice-President, eventually succeeding him.Adams served only one term as President but the programme makes clear (and the history books seem to confirm) that he sacrificed his position rather than act in a cynical and political way - he kept the young USA out of a European conflict for which people and politicians were clamouring.Several things combine to make this mini-series successful. Paul Giamatti turns in a stellar performance as Adams as does Laura Linney as his intelligent supportive wife. Theirs is both a love-match and a true working partnership. Giamatti inhabits the role and his presence and eloquence give him a real presence even though Adams is rendered accurately as a short tubby man (next to the towering George Washington he looks almost hobbit-like). At the same time his flaws such as short temper and stubbornness are not glossed over. The production values are excellent, helped by the wise decision not to try to recreate battle scenes or similar spectacles. Great attention is paid to contemporary living, fashion, manners, habits and speech - it is good to see that not all the Americans speak with modern American accents, many sound very British, as was the case.Even better, the British are not two-dimensional cardboard baddies. Usually they are off-stage and referred to, but when they appear in the drama they are human.  Actually there are only two such episodes - the scenes involving the Boston redcoats (mainly frightened boys plus a hard-bitten but basically honest professional officer), and later on  Adams' meeting with King George III when he presents his credentials as the new and recognised nation's ambassador to London. The surprisingly generous sentiments expressed on both sides are confirmed by the history books.But most refreshing of all is the hard look taken at America's ""Founding Fathers"" who are seen not as a collection of sanctified noble visionaries but as men, and men who whatever their courage and vision also had their own flaws, personalities and agendas. George Washington is noble and inspiring but not a whole lot more, Benjamin Franklin fiercely intelligent but more than a little devious (though his deviousness sometimes achieves more for the infant nation than Adams' straightforwardness), Alexander Hamilton an ambitious posturing buffoon, and Thomas Jefferson...Adams' relationship with Jefferson, his successor, is at the heart of the later episodes. From friendship and cooperation they pass through years of political and personal estrangement, only to be reconciled towards their deaths (they died on the same day). Jefferson is shown as noble but flawed, a wealthy man whose vision for America differs radically from that of the self-made and hard-working Adams. And this, I think, is the message of the series and why the realistic or revisionist (according to your views) vision is conveyed. Adams is a federalist. His vision is of a United States with a strong central government, a single nation bound by national institutors.  In other words what the USA is now. Jefferson is the spokesman for the alternative position, a vision of America where the real power resides with the individual states and a weak central government has only such powers as are needed for practical purposes. The tension between the two positions would cause problems for the nation until the huge and bloody Civil War decades later when the ""states' rights"" position that inspired the seceding Confederacy was finally crushed and a strong Union was firmly established. Adams, in short, is the man who had the vision of America as she is now. He deserves this rescue from his obscurity.",5,The second President rescued from obscurity,1268006400,"03 8, 2010",2010,5059,"['pro-American', 'Brit', 'series', 'few', 'years', 'ago', 'set', 'quiz',

Some of the acting was outstanding and the costumes were great. But the writing, pacing, cinematography and direction were below HBO standards. The history and timeline were a little dicey too.They couldn't include every detail, but that doesn't excuse inaccuracies like all 8 of the Brits charged in the Boston ""Massacre"" being found not guilty. Two were found guilty of manslaughter and branded, a scene Irving Stone used to great effect in his wonderful novel about John and Abigail,Those Who Love: A Biographical Novel of Abigail and John Adams. The courtroom scenes in the first episode are absolutely leaden as are the scenes in the Continental Congress, which should have been brimming with passion and debate. Also, I know that hand-held cameras are the rage now, but using a constantly jiggling hand-held camera during intimate scenes like the one in which Abigail tends to her dying son was maddeningly distracting and a very poor directing choice.John and Abigail were New England Puritans with a strict moral code who demanded a lot of their children, their friends and their colleagues. But they were also revered among the same for their wisdom and generosity. They had a huge and loving extended family of Adamses, Smiths, Quincys and Boylestons, all of whom, at various times, took in each others' kids, bailed each other out when debts mounted, held family holiday celebrations, etc. What I found saddest about this series was how it depicted them as utterly isolated from any larger social network.The old PBS seriesThe Adams Chroniclesis available on DVD. The production values are stiff but the writing is better in that 1970's series. PBS's American Experience episodeAmerican Experience: John and Abigail Adamsis on DVD.

Taking a cue from one of his greatest books, HBO produced the miniseries ""John Adams"", and the results are phenomenal.Starting with John Adams surprising defense of the British soldiers at the ""Boston Massacre"", John Adams tells the story of one of Boston's most compelling Revolutionary figures. History, in a sense, hadn't been too kind to this brilliant man, painting him pompous, opinionated, and oft times stubborn in his outlooks. The book, and now this fabulous miniseries, have laid claim to attack this image by painting a more well rounded man, and in the process, removing him from a revolutionary demi-god, to something that he actually was, a man.The miniseries is rich and rife with details, and realism. I have to say that I've been very impressed with the quality and caliber of many of the HBO movie productions. From costumes to scenery to special effects (just watch the scene of Abgail Adams' view of the British seige of Boston to take your breath away!), every thing here is dirty and real. The debates on the Declaration of Independence are covered in length, and with sweaty brows and stubborn opinions, you feel as if you are there.What impressed me most about the book, and equally the movie, is the life long love affair/partnership that John and Abigail had in their lives. She served as his wife, and more importantly, as his sounding board for ideas, offering constructive and to the point feedback, and was the true backbone of the community. Laura Linney's performance of her is enthralling; her beauty is amplified by her downplayed performance, and matches perfectly Paul Giamatti's blustering John. One scene: John is debating in bed between staying true to the crown, or joining the patriots, and Abigail, trying to sleep, gently keeps on placing her hand gently over her husband's lips to calm him.

I read McCullough'sTrumanat the urging of my grandfather and found it to be boring and ridiculously aggrandizing of the state, the presidency, and Truman the man. I had no intention of watching this HBO miniseries but did so, reluctantly, at the urging of my father-in-law.He certainly gave better advice than my granddad!Words cannot properly express how much I enjoyed this production. It is, without a doubt, the best historical film I've ever seen. I was worried that the founders would be portrayed as saints with little serious disagreement among them, but this was not the case at all. In fact, the miniseries pretty much follows the hardcore Jeffersonian line, depicting Washington as a Hamiltonian pawn and Adams as a Big Government centralist and possibly even monarchist.Adams is portrayed favorably, nonetheless, which it is quite likely is deserved. A man can be honorable and hold on strongly to wrongheaded ideas. Adams was an authoritarian and the miniseries does nothing to disabuse the viewer of this notion. Jefferson was for liberty, although his faults are accurately portrayed as well. For one, there is his imprudent support of the French Revolution, and on a more esoterically constitutional level, Adams is shown mocking Jefferson's contradictory support of the Louisiana Purchase -- which libertarians and paleocons perceive to be a gross abandonment of Jeffersonian principles and the first act of American Imperialism.Where Adams and Jefferson can find agreement is in their utter contempt for proto-neocon Alexander Hamilton. He is surely this miniseries' villain, whereas Adams and Jefferson are simply men of honor with radically different ideas. This presentation largely accurately depicts the formation of the United States through the time of Adams's death, as a battle of ideas. Although the pre-constitutional period is given short shrift, so are the Revolutionary and 1812 wars -- thankfully! There is no glorification of war here, and in fact, Adams's crowning achievement is keeping the U.S. out of war with France. If only modern presidents could be so motivated.Ideology aside, this production is beautifully rendered and emotionally engaging. The history is wrong in a few small and rather insignificant parts, but all in all, this is not only an immensely enjoyable viewing experience, but also extremely educational. This truly is something that could engage young minds in the ideas of our country's founding period, and thus, I recommend that it be viewed by high school government and/or American History classes.",5,"Surprisingly great, even from libertarian perspective",1219881600,"08 28, 2008",2008,2654,"['libertarian', 'am', 'not', 'fan', 'John', 'Adams', 'statist', 'hagiographer', 'David', 'McCullough', 'read', 'urging', 'grandfather', 'found', 'be', 'boring', 'ridiculously', 'aggrandizing', 'state', 'presidency', 'Truman', 'man', 'had', 'intention', 'watching', 'HBO', 'miniseries', 'did', 'so', 'reluctantly', 'urging', 'father-in-law.He', 'certainly', 'gave', 'better', 'advice', 'granddad', 'Words', 'can', 'not', 'properly', 'express', 'how', 'much', 'enjoyed', 'production', 'doubt', 'best', 'historical', 'film', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'seen', 'was', 'worried', 'founders', 'would', 'be', 'portrayed', 'saints', 'little', 'serious', 'disagreement', 'was', 'not', 'case', 'fact', 'miniseries', 'pretty', 'much', 'hardcore', 'Jeffersonian', 'line', 'depicting', 'Washington', 'Hamiltonian', 'pawn', 'Adams', 'Big', 'Government', 'centralist', 'possibly', 'even', 'monarchist.Adams', 'portrayed', 'favorably', 'nonetheless', 'quite', 'likely', 'deserved', 'man', 'can', 'be', 'honorable', 'hold', 'strongly', 'wrongheaded', 'ideas', 'Adams', 'was', 'authoritarian', 'miniseries', 'nothing', 'disabuse', 'viewer', 'notion', 'Jefferson', 'was', 'liberty', 'faults', 'are', 'accurately', 'portrayed', 'as', 'well', 'one', 'imprudent', 'support', 'French', 'Revolution', 'more', 'esoterically', 'constitutional', 'level', 'Adams', 'shown', 'mocking', 'Jefferson', 'contradictory', 'support', 'Louisiana', 'Purchase', 'paleocons', 'perceive', 'be', 'gross', 'abandonment', 'Jeffersonian', 'principles', 'first', 'act', 'American', 'Imperialism.Where', 'Adams', 'Jefferson', 'can', 'find', 'agreement', 'utter', 'contempt', 'proto-neocon', 'Alexander', 'Hamilton', 'surely', 'miniseries', 'villain', 'whereas', 'Adams', 'Jefferson', 'are', 'simply', 'men', 'honor', 'radically', 'different', 'ideas', 'presentation', 'largely', 'accurately', 'formation', 'United', 'States', 'time', 'Adams', 'death', 'battle', 'ideas', 'pre-constitutional', 'period', 'given', 'short', 'shrift', 'so', 'are', 'Revolutionary', '1812', 'wars', 'thankfully', 'glorification', 'war', 'here', 'fact', 'Adams', 'crowning', 'achievement', 'keeping', 'U.S.', 'war', 'France', 'only', 'modern', 'presidents', 'could', 'be', 'so', 'motivated.Ideology', 'aside', 'production', 'beautifully', 'rendered', 'emotionally', 'engaging', 'history', 'wrong', 'few', 'small', 'rather', 'insignificant', 'parts', 'not', 'only', 'immensely', 'enjoyable', 'viewing', 'experience', 'also', 'extremely', 'educational', 'truly', 'something', 'could', 'engage', 'young', 'minds', 'ideas', 'country', 'founding', 'period', 'thus', 'recommend', 'be', 'viewed', 'high', 'school', 'government', 'and/or', 'American', 'History', 'classes']",John Adams

Factually, there is nobody who can document so much of what's presented here as ""fact"" -- such as Hamilton and the Adam's cousin, screaming for blood, with twisted angry faces, as a Tory tax agent is tarred and feathered. One almost expects Walter Cronkite to step out from the crowd with a microphone, as in the old ""You Are There"" series.  It also appears to be a conscious effort to show the early American revolutionaries were no different from modern anti-global thugs throwing bricks through MacDonald's and Starbuck's windows, and carrying effigies of modern political leaders hanging from ropes while waving the Red Fascist flags.  The legitimacy of early American sentiments for freedom and self-government is thereby eroded and belittled, while modern fanatics are elevated inappropriately.  Or the ""small"" fact that two of the British soldiers at the Boston massacre actually were convicted, and one of them admitted to his lawyer that he was the one who shouted ""Fire"" (while discharging his weapon), and not one of the street mob. The erasure and clever distortion of those kinds of facts is exactly how a trained propagandists works, not to make big obvious lies, but to cleverly skew things in a particular direction, and also to highlight the rare event (ie, the tarring-and-feathering) to make it seem equal to common events (heavy-handed British thuggery against the population of the Americas) which are down-played, or not even mentioned!

I usually find Linney too bland for my taste, but her reserve here is excellent, and this may be her finest acting work on film - where she has this role of such depth - social restraint with great intelligence.This is a real high point for HBO that shows that they can match the qualtiy of BBC miniseries in historical accuracy, fine scripting, glorious costumes, and the casting of many British stars.

1109544,AM2B6RN2A3C55,B000WGWQG8,Joe,"[30, 79]","Besides the cockeyed video expressed by other reviewers, what makes this series really annoying is that they made it politically correct. Are we to believe that John Adams wife was his mentor and that she guided him on what to do? How about George Washington and Thomas Jefferson's wives, were they instrumental in their decisions too? I seriously doubt it. In 1776 the view of women was not as mentors and equals but as wives and mothers who watched after the home and children and that was it. They had no say in politics or for that matter much else. Another farce expressed in the movie is that at the Boston Massacre was started because a British soldier, Hugh White, was being picked on for no reason and that the order to shoot was not given by a British soldier. According to historians this is how it actually happened.On March 5, 1770, Hugh White served as sentry on King Street.  Some time after eight o'clock, White entered into an exchange with a wig-maker's apprentice, Edward Garrick, who was demanding payment from a British officer.  The exchange escalated into violence, as White struck Garrick with his musket, knocking him to the ground.  Regardless of which version of the story is more accurate, it is undisputed that within minutes an unruly crowd of young men surrounded Montgomery and began hurling insults such as ""Bloody lobster back!"" at him.  When the crowd swelled and he began being pelted with pieces of ice, Montgomery hurried to the Custom House, banged on the door and shouted, ""Turn out, Main Guard!""The eight-man guard finally emerged and marched to his rescue through a swelling crowd.Private Hugh Montgomery was one of the eight soldiers in the main guard commanded by Captain Preston to march to the Custom House in an attempt to save Hugh White.  After making their way to White, Montgomery and the other soldiers found themselves being surrounded by the mob.  They formed a sort of semi-circle.Soon, after a confusion of snowballs, ice chunks, and coal rained down on the British soldiers, someone shouted ""fire"" and five Americans were fatally wounded.  Trial testimony never definitively answered the question of who shouted ""fire"" and who fired the fatal shots.  In 1949, however, with the long-delayed publication of notes of Thomas Hutchinson, it was revealed that Montgomery admitted to his lawyers that it was he who started the Boston Massacre.  Hit in the chest and knocked to the ground by a club wielded by one of the rioters, Montgomery responded, he said, by shouting ""Damn you, fire!""  Montgomery fired first then the other soldiers followed.Of the British soldiers tried in October 1770, the jury convicted only Montgomery and one other soldier, Matthew Killroy.  Both were found guilty of manslaughter.  Montgomery and Killroy pleaded ""the privilege of clergy,"" a procedure that reduced their punishment from imprisonment to a branding on the right thumb.Don't believe me?

Actor Paul Giamati won an emmy award for his role as John Adams, the 2nd President of the United States.  Actress Laura Linney portrays Adam's wife Abigail Adams and does an outstanding job as well.  The mini sereis begins in Boston on the eve of the American Revolution where Adams is defending the British Soldiers involved in the ""Boston Massacre"".  Adams successfully defended the soldiers and is hailed by the British Governor who wants him to hold a higher office for ""His Majesty's"" Government.  Adams decides that he will not accept the job and realizes that America needs to be independent from Great Britain.  The series then goes into Adams meeting Thomas Jefferson, Benjamin Franklin, George Washington, and many other founding fathers and it is a riveting story.  Throughout the series you see Adams become Ambassader to France and Great Britain, dissolve his friendship with Thomas Jefferson, become the United States 2nd President, and also care for his family where there is plenty of tragedy.  Laura Linney portrays Abigail Adams who truly is John Adams partner in life.  She is spirited, devoted, loving, and critical of her husband.  The series spans more than 50 years, and every part of the series is fascinating and outstanding.  This series received many emmys for ""Best Mini Series"", ""Best Actor"", ""Best Actress"" and many more deservedly so.

Although John Adams was the smartest of our founders, he was not the most astute politically. The United States has to be the luckiest nation in the history of mankind. First there was geography. That we were an ocean away from Europe was important. Also we had such talented leaders at the right time. Whereas Franklin & Jefferson, to name the two most prominent, were charismatic & diplomatic as well as brillant, Adams was obnoxious, blunt & disliked. Washington was the undisputed leader & general of the army. As the first president, the constitution was written for him. Adams was obliged to follow him. How could he? How could anyone? This seven episode dvd was based on David McCullough's book. I read the book the week it came out several years ago & see few simularities, but maybe I need to reread it. I especially enjoyed some of the lesser known moments in history. Seven British soldiers were charged with murder in the incident know as the Boston Massacre. No one would defend them. Adams took the job & they were aquitted thereby reinforcing the idea that all accused are entitled to legal counsel, a concept we hold dear to this  day. Another moving moment was when John was absent, Abigail had their young children innoculated against the small pox epidemic. It is a bit graphic but effective. Abigail Adams remains as his most important advisor through their life. Wife, lover, best friend & critic she never failed him. The one person he could always trust unconditionally. Excellent casting of Paul Giamatti & Laura Linney as John & Abigail. A heavily made-up David Morse plays a rather wooden but effective George Washington. This is definately a high end, movie quality production. Through seven plus hours you get the feel of 18th century America. Buying the dvd you also get ""the making of..."" & a David McCullough biography. I could go on & on about Adam's time abroad, the revolution itself, his family & presidency.

I did not read the book (by David McCullough) this HBO series was based on to know if it was true to it or not, but the screenplay did well to make the founders multi-dimensional.  This is in contrast to presenting each and every one of them as super-human, as some accounts we have read, watched, or heard seem to suggest.  I have never been Paul Giamatti's biggest fan, but the depth he brings to John Adams through the many years the series spans is satisfying and more realistic than if played by an actor who I might have chosen.

There was no need for any of the gore scenes pertaining to the pox and when the doctor removes the cancerous tumor from Adams daughter later in the series. The Adams front yard must have been exactly in the path of major battles as their children are constantly being ushered into the house.What was up with camera work constantly shaking and leaning to and fro? Washington is almost portrayed as comic strip version of himself. Jefferson is always leaning on something. In the scene in which the White House is being built, was there no one else around? Was the entire White House plot made by slaves as the movie shows? The French are depicted as bizzar.

Menta, Jr.","[3, 3]","I guess one could always quibble about what was included or not included, emphasized or not emphasized, from the David McCollough book of the same name, but looking at this production just as an HBO mini-series, it's a complete triumph. One gets a generous examination of a variety of events: the famous ones we all learned about in school, lesser known historical events (John Adams actually defended the British soldiers involved in the Boston Massacre, for example), and all kinds of other things that took place over the course of John Adams' personal life.  It's all facinating and involving, without a shred of boredom.Like the book's approach, the mini-series' seven parts (each a shade over an hour), examines history in an intelligent and detailed manner, but always filtering it through the personal lives of Mr. Adams and his associates, and the personal challenges that everyone dealt with at the time (in particular, the challenges of disease and pestilence).  In other words, the story doesn't take the position of lauding great people in great times, but normal people doing their best in challenging times, which often resulted in greatness.As pointed out by a few other reviewers, this IS some nudity during ""John Adams"", but it's used to illustrate things like the cruelty of tarring and feathering (it wasn't the ""prankish"" activity it seemed like when we learned about it in school) and the primitive nature of 18th century surgery.  As such, ""John Adams"" is perfectly fine for older children on up, though not for those easily upset.""John Adams"" looks and sounds wonderful on standard DVD, with a special mention going to the outstanding orchestral soundtrack (both the rousing main theme and the subtle, crisp incidental music).  In keeping with the theme of emphasizing the personal over the iconic, the special features on the final disc include a wonderfully entertaining profile of David McCollough, which highlights the writer's often whimsical personality and comforting home life, letting his skills speak for themselves.  There's also a terrific special feature showing how many of the adaptation's special effects were created.I often say in these Amazon reviews that the worst thing that a piece of creative work could be is boring.  And ""John Adams"" is never that.

Having seen them in recent films, I was at first distracted by Paul Giamatti and Laura Linney as John and Abigail Adams.  But as the series went on, Giamatti and Linney disappeared and simply became John and Abigail.  The short, squat Adams seemed out of place in the pantheon of Founding Fathers.  This series shows that without his stubborn spirit (which was often not appreciated) the American Revolution would likely have failed.  And without Abigail's ""ballast,"" as John called it, John would likely not have been able to be the force he was.  In addition to seeing this country come into being, we see the intimate relationship of a remarkable couple as they face years of separation due to his work, tragedies with their children, scorn from the public and other elected officials, and difficult living conditions.  (Most of their life is on their farm, which they work themselves, and they move into the White House when it is half finished.

The election of the President and Vice-President was quite interesting in how it was accomplished.... so much less complicated than what we have today! Politics in general hasn't changed much, though....The producers have gone to great lengths to make the sets as close as possible to the actual places they are portraying. The actors have been transformed to what we today acccept as how these historical figures actually looked.

It was impressive to see such giants as George Washington, Thomas Jefferson, and Benjamin Franklin, as well as the lesser known individuals, truly inhabited by the actors.The challenge of the series was to breathe life into those stories and lives we know so well. The filmmakers worked closely to David McCullough's outstanding book for the details, along with the human side of the story captured in the voluminous correspondence of John and Abigail Adams. The political, military, and personal issues were all thoughtfully brought to life. The design values of the film were also superb. Nothing looked stagy or stilted in the sets and costumes, which provided an unusual authenticity of period style for television drama. With each appearance of George Washington (David Morse), it was hard not to gasp due to the believability of his character.The drama of America's breaking from England for independence was an improbable story and one dependent on the courage and idealism of the individuals portrayed in this film. The personalities of these great figures make this program an accessible and rewarding experience for the entire family. For the patient viewer, what emerges from the John Adams miniseries is not merely a history lesson, but a drama with great relevance today.

It tells the personal stories of John and Abigail Adams very well and in considerable detail. However, overall the series does not live up the promotions as an action-packed, tension-filled drama of the birth of the nation and the first years of the Republic.A true virtue of the series is that it is not chocked full of vulgar language. So, it is possible for HBO to do work that is not excessively pandering to the lowest common denominator. Still the presentation lacks coherence from one segment to the other and from one episode to the other. It may be good personal history but it is not good entertainment.The central problem with this series is that it covers far too much time using far to little film for far too much personal detail. It is devoid of overall theme, flow and action. In fact, if you have seen the 30 second ad for the series on MSNBC, you have seen all the action in the entire series.The cinema, sets and costumes are worthy. The actors work well in their roles but the whole story line is disjointed and often creates hardly more than a series of moments of pregnant silence. I guess that makes it authentic in portraying the New England character, but that should not take ten hours or so to communicate. Besides, all we need is Thornton Wilder for that dark task.A careful psychological study of the Adam's family life could be forgiven if the big ideas of the times were more in play. We get a glimpse, but only a fleeting glimpse, of some of the most dramatic events of Western History. This is a screenplay for the head, but not for the spirit. It conveys the idea of a rather common man thrust into a series of rather uncommon roles. I assume this director is dramatically inspired by Stanley and Blanche, but not by Paine and Rousseau.Unless you hang on every word written about the private lives of the founding fathers, spend your time more wisely if you are looking for an overall sense of the American Revolution. You will not find the fire in the belly and the smoke in the air. You will get a rather gloomy feeling of an age dark with self doubt, but you will not be inspired by the visions of independence and rebellion.The depictions of the creation of the Declaration of Independence, for example, would have you believe that Thomas Jefferson was insecure and that the rest of the delegates had little to contribute. You are to believe the sagacious Franklin and the venerable Adams rescued the self-doubting Hamlet-like Jefferson from the pettiness and venality of all the others.As a glorification of John Adams and his personal prejudices the series works. Yet it does little justice to Hamilton and others, while failing as a depiction of the genius of the age and the flowering of the Enlightenment.The production sacrifices the whole story for the episodic details of the person of John Adams.  That is certainly a permissible topic, just not wholly accurate as to the big picture, and not entertaining in the way the promotion leads one to believe it will be.",1,"A personal profile and history, without overall coherence and drama",1213142400,"06 11, 2008",2008,3040,"['over-hyped', 'series', 'personal', 'stories', 'John', 'Abigail', 'Adams', 'very', 'well', 'considerable', 'detail', 'However', 'overall', 'series', 'not', 'live', 'up', 'promotions', 'action-packed', 'tension-filled', 'drama', 'birth', 'nation', 'first', 'years', 'Republic.A', 'true', 'virtue', 'series', 'not', 'chocked', 'full', 'vulgar', 'language', 'So', 'possible', 'HBO', 'do', 'work', 'not', 'excessively', 'pandering', 'lowest', 'common', 'denominator', 'Still', 'presentation', 'coherence', 'one', 'segment', 'other', 'one', 'episode', 'other', 'may', 'be', 'good', 'personal', 'history', 'not', 'good', 'entertainment.The', 'central', 'problem', 'series', 'far', 'too', 'much', 'time', 'using', 'far', 'little', 'film', 'far', 'too', 'much', 'personal', 'detail', 'devoid', 'overall', 'theme', 'flow', 'action', 'fact', 'have', 'seen', '30', 'second', 'ad', 'series', 'MSNBC', 'have', 'seen', 'action', 'entire', 'series.The', 'cinema', 'sets', 'costumes', 'are', 'worthy', 'actors', 'work', 'well', 'roles', 'whole', 'story', 'line', 'disjointed', 'often', 'hardly', 'more', 'series', 'moments', 'pregnant', 'silence', 'guess', 'authentic', 'portraying', 'New', 'England', 'character', 'should', 'not', 'take', 'ten', 'hours', 'so', 'communicate', 'Besides', 'need', 'Thornton', 'Wilder', 'dark', 'task.A', 'careful', 'psychological', 'study', 'Adam', 'family', 'life', 'could', 'be', 'forgiven', 'big', 'ideas', 'times', 'were', 'more', 'play', 'get', 'glimpse', 'only', 'fleeting', 'glimpse', 'most', 'dramatic', 'events', 'Western', 'History', 'screenplay', 'head', 'not', 'spirit', 'conveys', 'idea', 'rather', 'common', 'man', 'thrust', 'series', 'rather', 'uncommon', 'roles', 'assume', 'director', 'dramatically', 'inspired', 'Stanley', 'Blanche', 'not', 'Paine', 'Rousseau.Unless', 'hang', 'word', 'written', 'private', 'lives', 'founding', 'fathers', 'spend', 'time', 'more', 'wisely', 'are', 'looking', 'overall', 'sense', 'American', 'Revolution', 'will', 'not', 'find', 'fire', 'belly', 'smoke', 'air', 'will', 'get', 'rather', 'gloomy', 'feeling', 'age', 'dark', 'self', 'doubt', 'will', 'not', 'be', 'inspired', 'visions', 'independence', 'rebellion.The', 'depictions', 'creation', 'Declaration', 'Independence', 'example', 'would', 'have', 'believe', 'Thomas', 'Jefferson', 'was', 'insecure', 'rest', 'delegates', 'had', 'little', 'contribute', 'are', 'believe', 'sagacious', 'Franklin', 'venerable', 'Adams', 'rescued', 'self-doubting', 'Hamlet-like', 'Jefferson', 'pettiness', 'venality', 'others.As', 'glorification', 'John', 'Adams', 'personal', 'prejudices', 'series', 'little', 'justice', 'Hamilton', 'others', 'failing', 'depiction', 'genius', 'age', 'flowering', 'Enlightenment.The', 'production', 'whole', 'story', 'episodic', 'details', 'person', 'John', 'Adams', 'certainly', 'permissible', 'topic', 'just', 'not', 'wholly', 'accurate', 'big', 'picture', 'not', 'entertaining', 'way', 'promotion', 'one', 'believe', 'will', 'be']",John Adams

It seems there are three main reasons for them not to like it:*It's all drama**the quirky camera angles and shots**the 'stiffness' and language of the actors*First off, yes, it is mostly drama with very little physical action. But that does not make it bad or boring - instead this is what brings the viewer in. And, with the inclusion of the (mostly) period-style language, one feels almost as if they were in the company of our nation's fore-fathers themselves. It seems that people in today's society need blood and guts action for them to like a movie. That's unfortunate, because just like in ""Gods & Generals"" (the Civil War flick), it's the drama that greatly enhances this movie. Yes, I would have liked to have seen a couple of battle scenes, but showing the wounded after the battle was just as moving.As for stiffness of the actors: someone stated in one of their reviews here that ordinary people of the late 18th century didn't act like the people shown in this series. Research shows that, yes, folks did act very similar to what's portrayed. You have to watch a movie like this not with a 21st century mindset but with the realization that people didn't always socially act the way they do today. It amazes me how so few people understand this.And speaking of personalities, I believe that all the actors - sans one -  fit their parts well, especially Benjamin Franklin. The one I was slightly disappointed with was the actor chosen to portray the younger General George Washington (during the 1770's). Although working well as the older PRESIDENT Washington, I feel they needed a younger man to play the part during the Rev War. The man chosen is just too old for the 1770's scenes.But, Thomas Jefferson was spot on!I do agree to an extent with other reviews that the way the film was shot can get a bit frustrating: angle left this scene - angle right the next - run with the camera the next scene...a little too overdone. But, you learn to over-look this. A minor thing in my opinion.By the way, the sets (computerized and otherwise) were so accurate - the details were amazing: true candle lit rooms, pulling the curtain past the door to help keep the cold out, the hat racks, framed silhouette pictures, the furniture and the rooms of the houses themselves, the ""extra's"" in the streets (vendors, animals, etc.)...I could go on and on - all as accurate as I have seen in any movie. It reminded me of the photos of the homes from Colonial Williamsburg, and even the few colonial era homes I visited personally at Greenfield Village in Dearborn, Michigan.And the clothing was perfect as well.Not a detail was missed. It seems as much went into the sets and clothing as into the acting and dialog. How refreshing.All things considered, this is a phenomenal work that has just blown me away.

I knew the man was a genius and his positions were right for the nation. However, he lacked people's skills and weren't able to push his agendas successfully in Congress. The problem with Adams was he served between Washington and Jefferson-two giants who legacies have only grown despite many of their own faults. Adams, after over 200 years, is finally having the last laugh (thanks to this series).This series does a great job in showing the man behind the presidency.

Of course, HBO always intended to present John Adams as entertainment, it is not a documentary and ought not be treated as such.The tone of the film is dark, Adams has a habit of taking everything a bit too seriously. The wardrobe of the period is limited to various shades or brown, black, gray and white. Though there are seven parts to the series, only a single episode is devoted to the Adams presidency. The miniseries is at its very best in the final episode, when a series of tragedies befalls Adams.Paul Giamatti does a phenomenal job representing the personality of the second U.S. president. Laura Linney plays his wife Abigail and Tom Wilkinson has moments of greatness as Benjamin Franklin. All three won Emmys, and the series itself set a record for the most awards in a single year.

The book leaves you with an uplifted feeling, but this movie focues too much on the tragedies and the negative aspects of John Adams personality. I think the fault lies squarely with the writer. There is only one writer listed and I think for a project of this scope more writers were needed. The series strives to be realistic, and yet it doesn't capture the joy and humor of life, nor the humorous side of the main characters, which is a huge, huge failing. Again I think this is due to weak writing--it's much easier to write tragic scenes than to come up with good wit and clever, naturalistic dialogue that real people with a passion for life might have together.As to Paul Giamatti, I thought he had some good moments in the role. He was more convincing in his portrayal of Adams as an older man, than as a younger man. Wilkenson was good, Laura Linney was fine, the rest of the actors were just okay. The main problem is none of them had a good script to work with. But this is a movie worth watching for one scene especially, which was really a standout to me-- the scene where the Adams walk into the white house and we can observe the workers.

Paul Giamatti portrayed Adams very well: a brilliant man not well versed in public relations skills, with so much perseverance in getting those supplies from France that he lost his manners. What a departure for Giamatti from ""Sideways"". Laura Linney also did an excellent job. Through these two great actors, I felt John and Abigail Adams's kinship (""Dear Friend""), love, passion, dedication to their families and country.The George Washington and Ben Franklin portrayals were very believable, almost uncanny. I think Jefferson, though, had a more fluid personality than was shown here.I also want to comment to others about some things they brought up. First, book vs. movie: an author has the freedom to explore as much as he/she likes in their writing and is free to portray a more genial Adams at any time. McCullough is a documentary writer, not a novelist. The HBO series turned his doc into a novelist kind of movie, which is to be expected. Therefore, there should be more tension, active drama and high conflict than is portrayed in a doc.  Second, it's a good idea to judge the book as it is - non-fiction - and the series as it is - a MOVIE. I'm glad I didn't read the book first, because now I want to.Some memorable scenes which stick in my mind:Our first Congress voting for independence. Not the high-minded, self-assured image schoolchildren get of lofty men in fancy velvet clothes, but one of a group of vulnerable men expressing great hesitation and fear in heavy silence. The look of ""Holy crap"" on their faces was priceless, after the near-unanimous vote. They had everything to lose, and they knew it too well.Dinner time at the grand dame's chateau in France. In the height of frivolous and lusty chatter at the table, Adams -- surrounding by painted men and women (many of them prostitutes) was obviously, painfully out of his league. Suddenly he demands in his strident manner, ""We need ships and supplies!""  And what does he get instead? Glassy stares from his stunned hosts. And there's Franklin, ready to sink into his chair! Priceless. Adams learned his manners eventually and softened the hard edges. Now, I don't know if this really happened, but again, it's a MOVIE, not a doc. Tension, conflict, drama!Nabby's breast surgery. The pain and terror this brave woman went through, with no anesthesia -- I cannot begin to imagine. Same with the man on the ship when a cannon ball from the British maimed him and his leg had to be cut. These scenes make me appreciate what they went through, and how easy we have it today.I recommend HBO's ""John Adams"" (on DVD) to anyone who wants a dramatic story about the Adams' intimate lives and their struggle for seeing our country to its independence.

Based on the book of the same title by David McCullough (watch the extra interviewing him), it is excellent history as well as character study.

Laura Linney is also brilliant as Abigail Adams, every bit the intellectual and emotional equal of John (the film does a great job of showing the important role she played). The more we see of the real history of our founding and its architects, the more amazing the story becomes.

There also was not the harmony and unity that is often implied. Our country was put together in the crucible of debate and compromise and hammering out some very different viewpoints as to what the country should look like. Adams and Jefferson (also portrayed very well by Stephen Dillane) were two opposites in philosophy and personality but who were able to work together (most of the time) for the good of the country (a novel idea for today's politicians). A great story about the founding of America. By the way, did you know BOTH Jefferson & Adams died on July 4, 2026, exactly 50 years after the Declaration of Independence.

1109601,A1IBKANWDYYFMV,B000WGWQG8,Marc Klein,"[5, 5]","When John Adams premiered on HBO back in April 2008, I thought it would be one 2 and half hour movie that would cover Adams entire life. However, doing so would have resulted in almost a 9 hour running time and who has patience  to sit through 9 hours of commercial free even if it is engrossing? And that is what John Adams is. An engrossing, well written and well acted  mini series. Paul Giamatti and Laura Linney are perfectly cast as Jon and Abigal Adams as is David Morse as George Washington.I was lucky enough to have read David McCullough's fascinating book that really took us into Adams life like we never saw before. Reading that, helped me understand the mini series so much better and the fact that McCullough was on set and approved and participated in the production brought more of an authentic feel. I do feel however that the movie tries and mostly succeeds in covering the entire book.Reading the book is one thing. Seeing it is another because you get to see visually how life was back then and what we as a colony went through under British rule and why Adams wanted Independence desperately.  John Adams single handedly made us a Democratic country and was one of the most honest men who ever lived.It is amazing that he and Jefferson died the same day hours apart and the film does a terrific job in showing that in a well edited scene. In fact, the entire film is well directed and edited and did I mention well written?John Adams is told in seven parts in chronological order though the film opens during and after the aftermath of the Boston Tea Party which allows us to see the brilliant lawyer that Adams was. That is pretty much the entire first part. Adams defending the accused British soldiers.In the 2nd part, is a bit long and drawn out and while unnecessary, I understand why the filmmakers spent 90 minutes on The Continental Congress. It is a crucial story point and basically sets up the rest of the movie and the Birth of America.I won't go into all 7 parts here but I will say that as the story went on, the story got deeper yet weaker in some places. There were places where you saw a character a few times but never seen or heard from again. I'm a little curious as to why Washington's death wasn't mentioned or the funeral shown. I thought, if done right, could have been an emotional few scenes. In the book there is a few pages where McCullough talks about how the nation mourned and how they celebrated the first President, a great general, and father of our country.All in all, John Adams was a great viewing pleasure that is now on DVD so if you don't have HBO and wanted to see this, now is your chance because it should NOT be missed.Tom Hanks and HBO score again and I wouldn't be surprised if come Emmy time, John Adams is given the most nominees because all involved deserve to win especially Paul Giamatti and Laura Linney who if not for them wouldn't have made the series what it was.",5,One of the finest mini series ever to air,1212278400,"06 1, 2008",2008,2940,"['When', 'John', 'Adams', 'premiered', 'HBO', 'back', 'April', '2008', 'thought', 'would', 'be', 'one', '2', 'half', 'hour', 'movie', 'would', 'cover', 'Adams', 'entire', 'life', 'However', 'doing', 'so', 'would', 'have', 'resulted', 'almost', '9', 'hour', 'running', 'time', 'who', 'patience', 'sit', '9', 'hours', 'commercial', 'free', 'even', 'engrossing', 'what', 'John', 'Adams', 'engrossing', 'well', 'written', 'well', 'acted', 'mini', 'series', 'Paul', 'Giamatti', 'Laura', 'Linney', 'are', 'perfectly', 'cast', 'Jon', 'Abigal', 'Adams', 'David', 'Morse', 'George', 'Washington.I', 'was', 'lucky', 'enough', 'have', 'read', 'David', 'McCullough', 'fascinating', 'book', 'really', 'took', 'Adams', 'life', 'never', 'saw', 'Reading', 'helped', 'understand', 'mini', 'series', 'so', 'much', 'better', 'fact', 'McCullough', 'was', 'set', 'approved', 'participated', 'production', 'brought', 'more', 'authentic', 'feel', 'do', 'feel', 'however', 'movie', 'tries', 'mostly', 'covering', 'entire', 'book.Reading', 'book', 'one', 'thing', 'Seeing', 'get', 'see', 'visually', 'how', 'life', 'was', 'back', 'then', 'what', 'as', 'colony', 'went', 'British', 'rule', 'why', 'Adams', 'wanted', 'Independence', 'desperately', 'John', 'Adams', 'single', 'handedly', 'made', 'Democratic', 'country', 'was', 'one', 'most', 'honest', 'men', 'who', 'ever', 'lived.It', 'amazing', 'Jefferson', 'died', 'same', 'day', 'hours', 'apart', 'film', 'terrific', 'job', 'showing', 'well', 'edited', 'scene', 'fact', 'entire', 'film', 'well', 'directed', 'edited', 'did', 'mention', 'well', 'written', 'John', 'Adams', 'told', 'seven', 'parts', 'chronological', 'order', 'film', 'aftermath', 'Boston', 'Tea', 'Party', 'see', 'brilliant', 'lawyer', 'Adams', 'was', 'pretty', 'much', 'entire', 'first', 'part', 'Adams', 'defending', 'accused', 'British', 'soldiers.In', '2nd', 'part', 'bit', 'long', 'drawn', 'out', 'unnecessary', 'understand', 'why', 'filmmakers', 'spent', '90', 'minutes', 'Continental', 'Congress', 'crucial', 'story', 'point', 'basically', 'up', 'rest', 'movie', 'Birth', 'America.I', 'wo', ""n't"", 'go', '7', 'parts', 'here', 'will', 'say', 'story', 'went', 'story', 'got', 'deeper', 'yet', 'weaker', 'places', 'were', 'places', 'where', 'saw', 'character', 'few', 'times', 'never', 'seen', 'heard', 'again', ""'m"", 'little', 'curious', 'why', 'Washington', 'death', 'was', ""n't"", 'mentioned', 'funeral', 'shown', 'thought', 'done', 'right', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'emotional', 'few', 'scenes', 'book', 'few', 'pages', 'where', 'McCullough', 'talks', 'how', 'nation', 'mourned', 'how', 'celebrated', 'first', 'President', 'great', 'general', 'father', 'country.All', 'John', 'Adams', 'was', 'great', 'viewing', 'pleasure', 'now', 'DVD', 'so', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'HBO', 'wanted', 'see', 'now', 'chance', 'should', 'NOT', 'be', 'missed.Tom', 'Hanks', 'HBO', 'score', 'again', 'would', ""n't"", 'be', 'surprised', 'come', 'Emmy', 'time', 'John', 'Adams', 'given', 'most', 'nominees', 'involved', 'deserve', 'win', 'especially', 'Paul', 'Giamatti', 'Laura', 'Linney', 'who', 'not', 'would', ""n't"", 'have', 'made', 'series', 'what', 'was']",John Adams

What a team our country had back at that time?!John Adams played the most important role in the U.S independence. Despite his no skill in the political arena, his sincerity and determination has set the ground for the country we have nowadays. His belief in freedom (he had no slaves), his loyalty to the law made the birth of our country a model for humankind in general.Only Divine providence can make this happen, a team of men with differences, but very well aligned with the proposal of freedom, in no matter what would happen they did it. From the first incident in Boston, in what brought John Adams to the picture, their wish came true years later with the declaration of independence from the great British Empire.  Of course, it was not an easy task to accomplish; many lives were perished in war.John Adams (athough not much recognized nowaday), Thomas Jefferson, Benjamin Franklin and the General Jorge Washington were a perfect quartet in the making of America. Each one of them played their role according to their principles and beliefs. They were not perfect; they were men with big dreams for the people and their community. It was an act of selfless; thought, they had some ego.Finally, we cannot forget the major role of women in that time; we would say that they were playing in different arena in supporting the cause, through the wise feedback to their companions. And the most important one was Abigail Adams, she was a rock behind the great John Adams.  We would say that there wouldn't be John Adams without Abigail.Anyway, I will not spoil your curiosity....

When I read McCullough's book three years ago I gained a new respect for the Founding Father who gets mentioned less often than the icons Washington and Franklin and Jefferson, but who had just as critical a role in American independence.  Before reading the book I didn't know that Adams was the lawyer who defended the British soldiers charged in the Boston massacre (winning their acquittal in a hostile Boston courtroom).  I also didn't know how outspoken he was at the Continental Congresses or that he pushed for Colonel Washington to be promoted to General of the Continental Army, and for Jefferson and Franklin to join him on the committee to draft the Declaration of Independence, which was polished by the eloquent Virginian Jefferson, but full of Adams' ideology. (The portion of the HBO Series detailing the Declaration of Independence seems more real and inspiring than any fictionalization of those events I had ever seen.)Adams was not as eloquent as Jefferson, or as natural a leader as Washington, or as globally respected as Franklin.  That he earned the second most votes in the first Presidential election (making him the first vice-president), and more votes than Jefferson in the third election(after Washington stepped down after two terms) speaks volumes for the esteem accorded him by his fellow Americans.He was arrogant and pompous (the series spends an appropriate amount of time on the ridicule he earned attempting to attach a vainglorious title to Washington's preferred ""President"".) But he was also completely devoted to justice, his country and his wife.  I read another review that said HBO had attempted to make this series ""PC"" by making Adams respectful of the views of his wife.  McCullough's book (and the preserved letters of John and Abigail to one another) make it clear that John Adams respected and loved none more than his wife, and I thought the series was realistic in the portrayal of their relationship.  Laura Linney does fine work as Mrs. Adams over several decades.This series does not take many missteps, and in many ways our Founding Fathers have seldom been portrayed as well.  Tom Wilkinson has the look and portrays the combination of old wisdom and geriatric lust of the 80 year old Franklin.  David Morse looks the part of the imposing General Washington.  Rufus Sewell nails the confrontational Alexander Hamilton.History buffs have little to complain about in this fine adaptation.",5,A mini-series is the right format for Mr. Adams,1214784000,"06 30, 2008",2008,2555,"['Pulitzer', 'Prize-winner', 'David', 'McCullough', 'excellent', 'biography', 'turned', 'six', 'hours', 'riveting', 'television', 'When', 'read', 'McCullough', 'book', 'three', 'years', 'ago', 'gained', 'new', 'respect', 'Founding', 'Father', 'who', 'mentioned', 'less', 'often', 'icons', 'Washington', 'Franklin', 'Jefferson', 'who', 'had', 'just', 'as', 'critical', 'role', 'American', 'independence', 'reading', 'book', 'did', ""n't"", 'know', 'Adams', 'was', 'lawyer', 'who', 'defended', 'British', 'soldiers', 'charged', 'Boston', 'massacre', 'winning', 'acquittal', 'hostile', 'Boston', 'courtroom', 'also', 'did', ""n't"", 'know', 'how', 'outspoken', 'was', 'Continental', 'Congresses', 'pushed', 'Colonel', 'Washington', 'be', 'promoted', 'General', 'Continental', 'Army', 'Jefferson', 'Franklin', 'join', 'committee', 'draft', 'Declaration', 'Independence', 'was', 'polished', 'eloquent', 'Virginian', 'Jefferson', 'full', 'Adams', 'ideology', 'portion', 'HBO', 'Series', 'detailing', 'Declaration', 'Independence', 'more', 'real', 'inspiring', 'fictionalization', 'events', 'had', 'ever', 'seen', 'Adams', 'was', 'not', 'as', 'eloquent', 'Jefferson', 'natural', 'leader', 'Washington', 'globally', 'respected', 'Franklin', 'earned', 'second', 'most', 'votes', 'first', 'Presidential', 'election', 'making', 'first', 'vice-president', 'more', 'votes', 'Jefferson', 'third', 'election', 'Washington', 'stepped', 'down', 'two', 'terms', 'volumes', 'esteem', 'accorded', 'fellow', 'Americans.He', 'was', 'arrogant', 'pompous', 'series', 'appropriate', 'amount', 'time', 'ridicule', 'earned', 'attempting', 'attach', 'vainglorious', 'title', 'Washington', 'preferred', 'President', 'was', 'also', 'completely', 'devoted', 'justice', 'country', 'wife', 'read', 'review', 'said', 'HBO', 'had', 'attempted', 'make', 'series', 'PC', 'making', 'Adams', 'respectful', 'views', 'wife', 'McCullough', 'book', 'preserved', 'letters', 'John', 'Abigail', 'one', 'make', 'clear', 'John', 'Adams', 'respected', 'loved', 'none', 'more', 'wife', 'thought', 'series', 'was', 'realistic', 'portrayal', 'relationship', 'Laura', 'Linney', 'fine', 'work', 'Mrs.', 'Adams', 'several', 'decades.This', 'series', 'not', 'take', 'many', 'missteps', 'many', 'ways', 'Founding', 'Fathers', 'have', 'seldom', 'been', 'portrayed', 'well', 'Tom', 'Wilkinson', 'look', 'combination', 'old', 'wisdom', 'geriatric', 'lust', '80', 'year', 'old', 'Franklin', 'David', 'Morse', 'part', 'imposing', 'General', 'Washington', 'Rufus', 'Sewell', 'confrontational', 'Alexander', 'Hamilton.History', 'buffs', 'have', 'little', 'complain', 'fine', 'adaptation']",John Adams

Clemmensen ""Mary""","[0, 0]","I have to say when I saw first saw the trailer for the HBO series, ""John Adams"" starring Paul Giamatti in the title role, I had some serious doubts as to whether or not I even wanted to see it. As an actor, Giamatti seemed to leave much to be desired if anything could be inferred by some of the minor parts he played in some incredibly abysmal examples of movies, such as: Howard Stern's Private Parts, My Best Friend's Wedding, and Big Momma's House.But in spite of his subpar resume, it turns out Giamatti CAN act. Giamatti creates an Adams who is as filled with self-doubt as he is patriotic fervor and the result is a believable, palpably human founding father who was as ambitious as he was flawed. The series begins on the evening of the Boston Massacre in 1770 and ends with the death of Adams in 1826- a span of some 56 years--which in and of itself is no small acting challenge but one that Giamatti manages to pull off rather convincingly.Laura Linney plays the forward-thinking, Abigail Adams, who was the intellectual equal and shrewd advisor of her famous husband. Linney is wonderful in the role. She readily conveys a character who is warm and God-fearing, yet possessed by unwavering Yankee pragmatism with a moral compass that seemingly never loses sight of its own personal North Star. Linney's effortless performance is a pleasure to watch and she easily captivates the viewer in much the same way that Abigail Adams charms the French naval officers, George Washington, Benjamin Rush and Thomas Jefferson.The series is superbly adapted from David McCullough's Pulitzer Prize-winning biography by the same title. Tom Hooper directs the series and does an exceptional job of it.  Unlike the heavy-handed direction that often typifies modern films, Hooper adroitly trusts the viewer to draw his/her own conclusions about various scenes or contentious situations, such as the frivolous French court's tepid reception of the bellicose, impatient Adams who is severely out of place as the American ambassador to France.Stephen Dillane is extremely well cast as Thomas Jefferson, who is as elegant-sounding as he is to look at; Tom Wilkinson plays a transparently self-promoting Benjamin Franklin who is seemingly unwilling to back American independence, or any patriotic cause, unless there is something in it for him; and Sarah Polley gives a poignant performance as the brave Nabby Adams who endues an unhappy marriage and then dies young, after undergoing a mastectomy with a minimal amount of laudanum as anesthetic.History buffs will enjoy the series which deftly combines historic fact with flesh and blood characters that are multi-faceted and compelling to watch.  Hooper's intimate direction easily draws the viewer into the respective scenes and helps the audience understand that the early days of American history were, in many ways, not much different than the stormy political climate in which we currently live in the present day; except that our founding fathers cared deeply about democracy and our current politicians do not.",5,John Adams- An Excellent and Informative Series,1334966400,"04 21, 2012",2012,3057,"['have', 'say', 'when', 'saw', 'first', 'saw', 'trailer', 'HBO', 'series', 'John', 'Adams', 'starring', 'Paul', 'Giamatti', 'title', 'role', 'had', 'serious', 'doubts', 'not', 'even', 'wanted', 'see', 'actor', 'Giamatti', 'seemed', 'leave', 'much', 'be', 'desired', 'anything', 'could', 'be', 'inferred', 'minor', 'parts', 'played', 'incredibly', 'abysmal', 'examples', 'movies', 'such', 'Howard', 'Stern', 'Private', 'Parts', 'My', 'Best', 'Friend', 'Wedding', 'Big', 'Momma', 'House.But', 'spite', 'subpar', 'resume', 'out', 'Giamatti', 'CAN', 'act', 'Giamatti', 'Adams', 'who', 'as', 'filled', 'self-doubt', 'patriotic', 'fervor', 'result', 'believable', 'palpably', 'human', 'founding', 'father', 'who', 'was', 'as', 'ambitious', 'was', 'flawed', 'series', 'evening', 'Boston', 'Massacre', '1770', 'death', 'Adams', '1826-', 'span', '56', 'years', 'small', 'acting', 'challenge', 'one', 'Giamatti', 'pull', 'off', 'rather', 'convincingly.Laura', 'Linney', 'forward-thinking', 'Abigail', 'Adams', 'who', 'was', 'intellectual', 'equal', 'shrewd', 'advisor', 'famous', 'husband', 'Linney', 'wonderful', 'role', 'readily', 'conveys', 'character', 'who', 'warm', 'God-fearing', 'yet', 'possessed', 'unwavering', 'Yankee', 'pragmatism', 'moral', 'compass', 'seemingly', 'never', 'sight', 'own', 'personal', 'North', 'Star', 'Linney', 'effortless', 'performance', 'pleasure', 'watch', 'easily', 'viewer', 'much', 'same', 'way', 'Abigail', 'Adams', 'French', 'naval', 'officers', 'George', 'Washington', 'Benjamin', 'Rush', 'Thomas', 'Jefferson.The', 'series', 'superbly', 'adapted', 'David', 'McCullough', 'Pulitzer', 'Prize-winning', 'biography', 'same', 'title', 'Tom', 'Hooper', 'series', 'exceptional', 'job', 'heavy-handed', 'direction', 'often', 'modern', 'films', 'Hooper', 'adroitly', 'viewer', 'draw', 'his/her', 'own', 'conclusions', 'various', 'scenes', 'contentious', 'situations', 'such', 'frivolous', 'French', 'court', 'tepid', 'reception', 'bellicose', 'impatient', 'Adams', 'who', 'severely', 'place', 'American', 'ambassador', 'France.Stephen', 'Dillane', 'extremely', 'well', 'cast', 'Thomas', 'Jefferson', 'who', 'as', 'elegant-sounding', 'look', 'Tom', 'Wilkinson', 'transparently', 'self-promoting', 'Benjamin', 'Franklin', 'who', 'seemingly', 'unwilling', 'back', 'American', 'independence', 'patriotic', 'cause', 'something', 'Sarah', 'Polley', 'poignant', 'performance', 'brave', 'Nabby', 'Adams', 'who', 'unhappy', 'marriage', 'then', 'young', 'undergoing', 'mastectomy', 'minimal', 'amount', 'laudanum', 'anesthetic.History', 'buffs', 'will', 'enjoy', 'series', 'deftly', 'historic', 'fact', 'flesh', 'blood', 'characters', 'are', 'multi-faceted', 'compelling', 'watch', 'Hooper', 'intimate', 'direction', 'easily', 'viewer', 'respective', 'scenes', 'audience', 'understand', 'early', 'days', 'American', 'history', 'were', 'many', 'ways', 'not', 'much', 'different', 'stormy', 'political', 'climate', 'currently', 'live', 'present', 'day', 'founding', 'fathers', 'cared', 'deeply', 'democracy', 'current', 'politicians', 'do', 'not']",John Adams

Linney in particular powerfully makes the case that without the emotional intelligence of Abigail Adams as counterbalance to her husband's inexhaustable volatility our history might have been very different.John Adams is time well spent and highly recommended.",5,Roll Over Franklin And Tell Jefferson The News,1210809600,"05 15, 2008",2008,991,"['much', 'argue', 'HBO', 'interpretation', 'David', 'McCullough', 'Pulitzer', 'Prize', 'winning', 'masterwork', 'timelines', 'cinematography', 'perhaps', 'casting', 'choices', 'However', 'technical', 'issues', 'are', 'really', 'point', 'do', 'little', 'undermine', 'overall', 'power', 'scope', 'entire', 'series', 'think', 'know', 'events', 'idealized', 'rote', 'history', 'McCullough', 'baseline', 'brilliantly', 'struggle', 'imperfect', 'men', 'attempting', 'create', 'perfect', 'government', 'series', 'was', 'constantly', 'reminded', 'old', 'admonition', 'grotesque', 'similarities', 'making', 'sausage', 'legislation.The', 'core', 'cast', 'Paul', 'Giammati', 'Laura', 'Linney', 'Tom', 'Dellane', 'spectacular', 'Linney', 'particular', 'powerfully', 'case', 'emotional', 'intelligence', 'Abigail', 'Adams', 'counterbalance', 'husband', 'inexhaustable', 'volatility', 'history', 'might', 'have', 'been', 'very', 'different.John', 'Adams', 'time', 'well', 'spent', 'highly', 'recommended']",John Adams

I love to watch both Giamatti and Lineey in anything they do, but this was worthy of their talents. Because of Giamatti's extraordinary acting abilities you can see the complexities of John Adams. Giamatti is brilliant in showing the internal struggle and the effect of outside pressures with/on our 2nd President. I must admit, I had only rudimentary knowledge of John and Abrigal Adams...(you know, History 101). The story line not only kept my interest, but spurred my desire to learn more more these two incredible people.  I was entralled with the portrayal on the events leading to Declaration of Independence and the American Revolution.

1109629,A39SJ6V6QCGC37,B000WGWQG8,Midge,"[5, 7]","This is one of the best movie epics I've ever seen... A truly fabulous, movie with superb acting. It was completely engrossing from the moment it started until the final scene. It is a work of art!  I truly recommend this movie... but extreme caution with allowing children to watch. There are a couple of extremely disturbing scenes which you may want to bypass for the sake of children.I was amazed at how well Paul did in his role... as did Linny. I had no idea he was this talented. He surprised me with his outstanding performance. Both were completely believable as if they were the original figures they portrayed and looked very close to the original couple as well. I almost did not recognize her without her blond hair.I also wanted to make note of the excellent musical score. Normally, I don't mention this but this was a unique sound combination of Irish flair violin and military cadence... very enjoyable. I was extremely impressed by the musical score.The movie also has a feature which brings up extensive historical notes throughout the entire film which you can opt to turn on. I recommend trying this on the second time you watch the film... it would ruin the movie if you do this on the first viewing.I enjoyed it so much, I intend to watch it more than once. It was that fantastic. I was quite astounded to find the movie so intriguing. It was a quality production on the scale of high dollar epics such as ""Hawaii."" I can't say enough great things about it. I'm glad I didn't read any of the reviews prior to watching the movie. I'm not sure what movie these negative nellies were watching... but it wasn't the same movie I saw. I was completely immersed in the movie from the moment I turned it on until the final scene.It was refreshing to see some of the historical events finally being shown in the spirit of how they really were instead of the sugar coated facades we have been fed most of our lives... such as the Boston Massacre. It was provoked by a huge mob of 200-400 throwing rocks and ice inside snowballs at the British sentries. The incident was used by the colonists as propaganda. Sam Adams was a true rabble rouser just as depicted in the film. He was the biggest ringleader in the break from Britain with his drunken mob, ""The sons of Liberty"" who pulled all kinds of nasty deeds to drive out the British and start the revolution with England. (Tarring and feathering were indeed some of their deeds). While they were indeed the main catalyst behind the break from Britain... they weren't the fine, respectable gentlemen history had shown them to be.This movie shows them more accurately for the tavern mobs and street gangs they truly were. But depicting them as they were realistically, does not diminish the fact that it often takes a mob mentality to find the gumption to fight improprieties and crimes against liberties. Those with no hope, often don't have the strength to fight back as we've seen in slavery. But to show history other than it was is a disservice to us all. This movie brings back that reality to our history.For John Adams to have defended the hated British sentries so successfully after the shootings, in front of a Boston jury of colonists, is a tribute to his skills as an attorney and evidence of how badly this mob of colonists behaved.However, the depiction of the unbridled display of public ranting in the courtroom was totally unnecessary and I doubt accurate. I don't think any court... especially one still under the rules of the British, would have tolerated a rowdy public exhibition of the colonists in a courtroom. It almost ruined the viewing experience. Reminded me of the Trial by Q on Star Trek TNG Farpoint. Very irritating.No court would not have allowed the witnesses or accused to have been pressed in on and their testimonies intimidated and threatened by ranting, nasty crowds. However, Sam Adams was indeed, every bit the hothead he was shown to be in this film.While it is true that 2 of the soldiers were actually found guilty of manslaughter (which was not depicted in the film)... their only punishment was to have their thumbs branded. Fortunately for the British sentries, one of the slain members of the mob provided a death bed statement as to the actual events which helped defend the actions of the guards. It wasn't the huge issue some reviewers made of the differences. You can read about this trial and incident online. [...]I was a little puzzled by the film first showing the Adam's to be living in town... and then showing them to be living on a farm outside of town. It is my understanding that they always lived on a farm but the massacre did take place within view of Mrs Adams. But the two houses were a bit confusing unless they had 2 homes at the same time?On the minor negatives, the one thing that was distracting to me was seeing Paul Giamatti's shaved bald head in the early scenes each time he came into the house and took off his wig. Colonial men did not shave their heads. They wore their hair long. So, every time they showed him pulling off his wig with the shaved head, it totally ruined those scenes for me because it broke the mood of the character and became an irritant. It was like having the actor take off their makeup during the scene. They need to keep the actor in character... not transpose 21st century hairstyles. Fortunately, they stopped doing this after the first DVD. Why go to the trouble to be historically accurate and then do something like this?The scene of cutting off his daughter's breast was totally unnecessary and uncalled for. There was no reason to subject the audience to that kind of thing... it is as bad as showing literal amputations. We don't need to see things like that. The film can make the issue known without showing us a gory graphic depiction of it. How would they like to see a graphic castration? This scene was mortifying and I would hate to think any child might be subjected to that. It was bad enough for adults. This was a VERY BAD lack of judgment on the directors part... and the producer who should have been keeping track of what the director was doing.Again, there was no need to horrify the audience. This film should have been a family docu-drama... and still can be with elimination of a couple of those unnecessary scenes.The other scene which was a negative issue was the tar & feather scene. Most people who watch a historical docu-drama are not expecting full frontal nudity for one with half exposure of the genitals... 97% nudity at least... especially if they are showing this to their family. It was also quite brutal, too literal and far too much time spent on it. It could have been depicted without forcing the audience to endure the full ordeal. While it may be authentic... it was not necessary.We also did not need to see the graphic depiction of the pox vaccinations and the daughter's ordeal. It is ok to include it but the level of graphic details were not needed. It was really quite disturbing. Accuracy does not always required graphic display. For instance, we do not need to see the contents of the bucket to know that someone has thrown up. The sound alone is more than enough to indicate the same.I also agree that they should have shown more about the political mudslinging with Jefferson and Hamilton and more about the animosity that was occurring at the time he lost his bid for re-election. It was a major issue of the rift between them. There were also too many do-nothing scenes of Adams sitting in the gutted white house and not enough of Adams interactions with politics and politicians. They really showed nothing of him being president.Having lived in France during the 66 Exodus of Americans, it was refreshing to finally see the behaviors and attitudes of the French being portrayed more true to life on a film and Adam's reaction to them. The reason this is important is because it helps to understand why there has always been such bitterness between the French and British and Americans. In fact, there were things a lot worse than was shown on the film... from hygiene, to attire and behaviors I have witnessed in person, which are so bad I cannot repeat them on here. I can only imagine what our diplomats encountered 200 years earlier. (Tourists don't see these things. If you haven't lived in the older, unmodernized sectors of the country... you don't know the these aspects).While Benjamin Franklin was amazing on a lot of things... there was a dark side to him which was not that pretty for history or public consumption. It was refreshing to see this other side of him for a change. I had read about Ben Franklin's lewd habits from many sources... especially his escapades in France. He spent nearly all of his life overseas and almost none in the colonies until after the Constitution. While he was quick of wit, funny and brilliant... he was also a shameless, lazy lothario who spent all of his time partying with ladies from the brothels and had no use or time for his wife or family. Fans of Franklin's don't like to hear about his darker nature... but that's how he truly was by his own admission whether his fans like it or not. Celebrities are not perfect and some have very bad sides as was the case with Benjamin Franklin. He was admittedly a dirty old man, self indulgent who completely ignored his own family and children. He was lazy and irresponsible and admitted to spending most of his time fornicating with the lowest and nastiest of street women as depicted in this movie instead of doing the job he was sent there to do. His behavior was shameless and many lives were lost while he partied to satiate his own debaucheries.There is an excellent DVD of Franklin's life in the history channel set ""The founding of America"" showing a lot of Franklin's true behavior... but this Adam's miniseries did an excellent job showing Franklin's (rarely exhibited) caustic personality and reactions at having his shameless, x-rated cavorting disrupted. He used his popularity as a weapon of power and usually kept this dark side hidden from public. He reveled and garnered public adoration by using wit, humorous anecdotes and quips in his publications. He also enjoyed amazing the uneducated masses with sideshow tricks already known by scientists of that era... but which awestruck the commoners whom had never seen such things. Static generators had long since been developed before his kite experiment but his stunt made it appear to the masses he was the first to deal with such things. It was all presentation for the attention he so readily craved.He enjoyed having his ego stoked & fed with clamoring crowds of admirers. The people of France treated him like they did Jackie Kennedy... as a celebrity. They had his face printed on all kinds of souvenirs and gadgets. Franklin's face was on so many things that the King of France had a bedpan made with Franklin's face... which should give you an idea how Franklin's personal pursuit of celebrity attention for his own pleasure had actually damaged the King's impression of the colonists and caused him to look down upon us. Thus, Franklin was not doing the job so desperately needed by our soldiers and Gen Washington... but the colonial congress was full of egocentric dandies who weren't any better than Franklin... and weren't any more interested in holding up their promises to the troops either. They all thought Franklin was great fun, thus Franklin was never reprimanded. He had free reign to indulge his indiscretions without oversight.To get even more attention, Franklin even took to wearing coonskin hats... something he never did anywhere other than France. The ladies even designed their hairstyles over his hats. He liked being the center of attention to bring him endless ladies and parties.Adams wanted to get down to business and talk details of supplies and support for the colonial troops. But Franklin didn't want Adams to screw up his own egomaniacal celebrity status in France which brought him endless droves of ladies, parties and personal attention to stroke his ego. Franklin spent years in France partying with the ladies instead of doing his job to get funding, weapons and military support for our troops. Sure, he finally got it... After we won a decisive battle and they did turn the tide at the end... but how many soldiers died in the interim so that Franklin could enjoy his years of brothel lifestyle?He didn't want Adam's rocking the boat for his personal entertainment. The depiction of the animosity on this film was excellent and the best rendition I have seen of the ""real"" Benjamin Franklin which the colonists never got to see. Franklin spent the first 70 years of his life in England and nearly a decade in France. Only the final years after the Constitution did he live in the US... after his wife died while he was cavorting in France.While some reviewers made a big deal out of Adam's relationship with his son Charles... Franklin had the same with his own son and didn't speak to him. But the portrayal on this film was accurate to the historical info available from many other reference sources. However, Charles was one of those kids who never listened and was constantly getting into trouble. There are just some kids who are like this regardless of the parent. John Adams also raised a son who became President... so he had a son at each end of the spectrum... so that doesn't indicate the parent was bad. Often, the younger sons act out toward older brothers who they perceive as the parent's pet. You see this with royal families all the time. A lot of families with multiple boys usually has two opposite boys. Just look at Princes William and Harry. So for a reviewer to blame the father seems more like a personal issue. A broader view will show this is a common thing in larger families and especially in families of notoriety. But can also be due to parental or position related favoritism as well.Congress sent Adams abroad to get rid of him. As a lawyer and an honest man, he was particular to details and honor and making good on promises. The Colonial Congress didn't support Washington's troops with the supplies, food, money and munitions they so desperately needed. As Adams stated... they just liked hearing themselves talk and thinking of themselves as important men. They were only interested in their own social standings and notoriety... much like Franklin, although in a different manner.One other scene which was poorly done was the scene with King George. Very badly written and even worse portrayed by the actor. The way he stood there by the chair, you were questioning whether or not he was the King at all or whether he was a footman. This scene should have been completely redone. It was one of the few badly written, badly acted scenes in the entire movie.Adams wasn't a ""good ole boy"" or one of the ""social elite"" so he didn't play along when the rest of the representatives who didn't keep their words or do their duty. He believed in being forthright, honest and responsible. Adams would have rocked the boat in the congress rather than let our troops suffer the way they did... so they sent Adam's to Europe to get rid of him. Unfortunately, being a man of integrity and honor bound to duty... he did what he was told. He should have just gotten on a boat and come back or refused. But being duty-bound, he allowed them to run him around without disputing it. The only way Congress would have done their jobs would have been by tossing it back in their laps. This movie did an excellent job showing the egotism, selfishness and petty bickering of our representatives of that era. Not so different from today. Unfortunately, Adam's didn't have the fortitude to speak out and stand up against them. He was a ""loyal patriot"" who did whatever they assigned him to.However, it was also refreshing to see that realism of the petty bickering in Congress and the impotent group they truly were instead of the sugar coated facade we have been shown in school most of our lives. Like Adams said about the painting at the end... the image was a fraudulent depiction from how it truly was and our politicians have made sure history was redesigned to make them all look like gallant saviors. Adams & Jefferson did most of the work while the rest bickered and whined.The behavior of the colonists depicted by this movie is indeed authentic... as was the behavior of John's hothead, rabble rousing, political agitator cousin, Sam Adams. The colonists did behave like lawless mobs. This movie did show a realistic depiction of how they really behaved at that time. In fact, most of them would get liquored up and stirred into a frenzy then go out into the streets looking for someone or something to transfer their rage against. Sam's ""Sons of Liberty"" were made up of the hotheaded drunkards who spent most of their time in the taverns. This is a historical fact whether or not people like it. It is unfortunate that some immature people create idyllic images in their minds which have no bearing on actual events whatsoever. Even worse are those efforts history has made to glorify or demonize various events in a manner which has no comparison with the truth... and then teach those falsehoods in our history lessons.It was about time that someone did a realistic rendition of the true events and circumstances of our history. We need to see history as it truly was... not as we would like it to be.An excellent film. I highly recommend it but I would advise extreme caution on the two or three scenes if you intend to allow your children to watch. You should locate and preview those scenes before you allow your children to watch... then you can skip past them when permitting your children to view the film so they won't be subjected to it.",5,Excellent & truly engrossing... just a couple minor issues,1270080000,"04 1, 2010",2010,17807,"['one', 'best', 'movie', 'epics', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'seen', 'truly', 'fabulous', 'movie', 'superb',

1109631,A1FG91CM8221X1,B000WGWQG8,Miles D. Moore,"[2, 2]","There are two main criticisms of the HBO miniseries based on David McCullough's biography of John Adams, and I don't understand either of them. The first is that the miniseries makes Adams less admirable than he was in the book. Frankly, that was my main criticism of the book--that McCullough tended to gloss over Adams' well-documented character flaws. To my mind the miniseries presents Adams pretty much as he must have been--vain, petty, quarrelsome, yet also strong, brilliant, courageous, and incorruptible. I find I love the man all the more for his flaws, because he overcame them so wonderfully to become a truly great man.The second criticism is that Paul Giamatti is unconvincing as Adams--a slam that to me is totally unfounded. Who did they want as Adams--Harrison Ford? I think Giamatti was the perfect actor to play Adams, and his performance is as wonderful as I expected it to be. Laura Linney is equally superb as Abigail Adams--if both she and Giamatti don't take home Emmys this year, it will be a screaming injustice--and the entire cast is first-rate, including Stephen Dillane as Thomas Jefferson, David Morse as George Washington, Tom Wilkinson as Benjamin Franklin, and Sarah Polley, Ebon Moss-Bachrach, Kevin Trainor and Samuel Barnett as the Adams' children.Everything about this miniseries seems absolutely right; this is the first drama I've seen about the American Revolution that to my mind captures the look and feel of 18th-century America. And I still can't get the soaring, touching theme music out of my head (two composers, Rob Lane and Joseph Vitarelli, are credited with the music).

1109633,A1AFXJ8U72MD6L,B000WGWQG8,"MISTER SJEM ""sonofhotpie""","[1, 1]","As of 2011, this show has won more Emmy awards than any other miniseries and four Golden Globe awards. Tale is focused upon the underrated John Adams (our second American President) and the first 50 years of this country's emergence. There's a lot of accurate details about the period in this miniseries and even though it isn't 100% historically accurate it's better than most presentations and in the eyes of some that's as good as it gets (see David Hinckley of the N.Y. Daily Times). While it deviates from the actual book it was based upon I don't care to nitpick on the historical inaccuracies as the rule then becomes they have to get it 100% right and if that's the measurement bar well nobody is going to want to make anything historical again. That said, I am still an enthusiast for historical accuracy so I'll mention some of the major mess ups below. Anyway, the cast is incredibly impressive: Paul Giamatti as John Adams, Rufus Sewell as Alexander Hamilton, Laura Linney as Abigail Adams, David Morse as George Washington, Tom Wilkinson as Benjamin Franklin, Zeljko Ivanek as John Dickinson and several others. The miniseries does a great job in catching the hardship and struggles of the period as well as giving viewers a broad overview of historical incidents that were likely not covered or glossed over in their History classes. Based on a book of the same name by David McCullough. This film was developed in a number of places but a great deal of the footage was executed in Virginia. Critics were mostly positive towards the miniseries but a minority were not happy with it, especially in that some felt Giamatti was unsuited for the role of John Adams (even though he won Best Leading Actor from the Emmys & Best Performance by an Actor in a Miniseries from the Golden Globes). Speaking of which the Golden Globes and the Emmies both gave it Best Miniseries for 2008.This is a wonderful miniseries to brush up on, especially if you want to get a mostly accurate coverage of the bigger points during the times of our Founding Fathers. HISTORICAL ACCURACY (for a Hollywood picture): B plus; CHARACTERS/DIALOGUE: A minus; STORY/PLOTTING: A minus to A; PATRIOTIC THEMES: B plus to A minus; WHEN WATCHED: June to July 2011; OVERALL GRADE: A minus. BEST DIALOGUE: John Adams: Facts are very stubborn things.//// John Hancock: [reluctantly] God save the King.Samuel Adams: God damn the King! Benjamin Franklin: [happily] God bless the King. Who else could've brought such a spirit of unity to the Congress? //// Thomas Jefferson: I expect that any constitutional document that emerges from Philadelphia will be as compromised as our Declaration of Independency. I am increasingly persuaded that the Earth belongs exclusively to the living, and that one generation has no more right to bind another to its laws and judgments, than one independent nation has the right to command another./// Alexander Hamilton: The future prosperity of this nation rests chiefly in trade. Trade depends, among other things, on the willingness of other nations to lend us money. Thomas Jefferson: And how would you propose to establish international credit? Alexander Hamilton: Our first step would be to incur a national debt. The greater the debt, the greater the credit. And to that end I have recommended to the president that Congress adopt all the debts incurred by the individual states during the war through a national bank. The idea being that if the states owe Congress money, then other nations will feel more inclined to lend it to us. Thomas Jefferson: If the states are indebted to a central authority, it increases the power of the central government. Alexander Hamilton: There you have it exactly. The greater the government's responsibility, the greater its authority. Thomas Jefferson: The moneyed interest in this country is all in the north, so the wealth and power would inevitably be concentrated there in a federal government. To the expense of the south. Alexander Hamilton: If that is the case, it is unavoidable if the Union is to be preserved. Thomas Jefferson: I fear our revolution will have been in vain if a Virginia farmer is to be held in hock to a New York stock jobber, who in turn is in hock to a London banker. The opportunities for avarice and corruption would certainly prove irresistible. Alexander Hamilton: Well there you have it, as I have heard said, ""If men were angels then no government would be necessary."" //// Alexander Hamilton: If we're forced to rely on incompetent state militias for our defense, we may as well start learning French now, Mr. President. [chuckling] A national army binds the country much as a national bank does.////John Adams: I have seen a queen of France with 18 million livres of diamonds on her person, but I declare that all the charms of her face and figure added to all the glitter of her jewels did not impress me as much as that little shrub right there. Now your mother always said that I never delighted enough in the mundane, but now I find that if I look at even the smallest thing my imagination begins to roam the milky way! HISTORICAL INACCURACIES OF NOTE: (1) John Adams did not have to cast a tiebreaker in regards to the Jay Treaty (peace with Britain) as it was never that close; (2) Abigail Adam's snipe at Franklin about his affair while he was married was inaccurate as his wife had died several years back; (3) Adams begun correspondences with Jefferson years before his wife died, not after her death.",5,AWESOME

We would not now have a country without John Adams.  In spite of his mistakes (the Aliens and Seditions Act being the worst), he was an honest, ethical person whose contributions have been overshadowed by better politicians like Jefferson and Franklin. He was generations ahead of his time in his social perspectives (his staunch abolitionism and respect for women being two of them). There is no John Adams monument in Washington, DC and no picture of Adams on our everyday currency (despite non-Presidents images appearing) but at least we have McCullough's wondrous book and now this beautiful film.  Abigail Adams, no less a person than John Adams, was her husband's best friend and chief adviser.  They were equals at a time when there was little power for, as Abigail said, ""women and slaves"".The film completely recreates the time.  Anyone who has been to Adams' birthplace and Peacefield can attest to how accurate the depictions are of those places.  Giamatti's intelligent, intuitive performance has made  the role his.  Linney, Dillane, Morse and Wilkinson are also excellent.  The direction is adult, unflinching and honest.  And yes, it is shot a bit dark but the content more than makes up for the camera.

This is one of those!From start to end, we are presented with a compelling drama, which is not only reeks of authenticity (though of course, what do I know - I'm not an historian..) but is an absorbing portrayal of a couple in love, a family in motion, and the birth of a nation.Paul Giamatti is simply superb casting to play John Adams - a man who is not portrayed as charismatic or `pretty' but clever, sincere, moral and committed.  Events start with the Boston Massacre, leading up to the Boston Tea Party, the War of Independence (unseen for the most part since Adams spent most of the time in Europe), the drafting of the Constitution and of course his term as the second president of the United States, before his retirement years.  It's not told as a simplistic TV movie of the week triumph in hard times, but is told as a well rounded look at the man through fascinating historical times.  Some victories, some defeats, some frustrations, but most of all the relationships with people he knew.  Most fascinating of these was his wife Abigail, portrayed in definitive form by the ever adaptable Laura Linney.  It seems the story of one is equally the story of the other, so intertwined are their stories.  And then there are other supporting cast members, David Morse as Washington, Stephen Dillane as Thomas Jefferson and Tom Wilkinson having a blast as Benjamin Franklin.Events are never told with rose colored glasses.. this is warts and all, and even handed, showing Adam's frustrations and bitternesses as well as his successes, and indeed also the country's sometimes ugly birth pangs as it discovers its identity.  There is little in the way of big budget battle scenes, the battles are for the most part off screen. And yet despite often being a talking heads exercise, the canvas seems writ large, giving the impression at times that we really are looking through a window to the times, rather than a cleaned up portrayal of it.Recommended, for both those interested in a pivotal time in history, and those interested in the development of a fascinating character and those around him.",5,TV historical drama does not get much better,1242345600,"05 15, 2009",2009,2244,"['Occasionally', 'TV', 'drama', 'regret', 'using', '5', 'stars', 'something', 'else', 'just', 'can', 'say', 'one', 'much', 'better', 'one', 'start', 'end', 'are', 'presented', 'compelling', 'drama', 'not', 'only', 'authenticity', 'course', 'what', 'do', 'know', ""'m"", 'not', 'historian..', 'absorbing', 'portrayal', 'couple', 'love', 'family', 'motion', 'birth', 'nation.Paul', 'Giamatti', 'simply', 'superb', 'casting', 'play', 'John', 'Adams', 'man', 'who', 'not', 'portrayed', 'charismatic', 'pretty', 'clever', 'sincere', 'moral', 'committed', 'Events', 'start', 'Boston', 'Massacre', 'leading', 'up', 'Boston', 'Tea', 'Party', 'War', 'Independence', 'unseen', 'most', 'part', 'Adams', 'spent', 'most', 'time', 'Europe', 'drafting', 'Constitution', 'course', 'term', 'second', 'president', 'United', 'States', 'retirement', 'years', 'not', 'told', 'simplistic', 'TV', 'movie', 'week', 'triumph', 'hard', 'times', 'told', 'well', 'rounded', 'look', 'man', 'fascinating', 'historical', 'times', 'victories', 'defeats', 'frustrations', 'most', 'relationships', 'people', 'knew', 'Most', 'fascinating', 'was', 'wife', 'Abigail', 'portrayed', 'definitive', 'form', 'ever', 'adaptable', 'Laura', 'Linney', 'story', 'one', 'equally', 'story', 'other', 'so', 'intertwined', 'are', 'stories', 'then', 'are', 'other', 'supporting', 'cast', 'members', 'David', 'Morse', 'Washington', 'Stephen', 'Dillane', 'Thomas', 'Jefferson', 'Tom', 'Wilkinson', 'having', 'blast', 'Benjamin', 'Franklin.Events', 'are', 'never', 'told', 'rose', 'colored', 'glasses..', 'warts', 'even', 'handed', 'showing', 'Adam', 'frustrations', 'bitternesses', 'as', 'well', 'successes', 'indeed', 'also', 'country', 'sometimes', 'ugly', 'birth', 'pangs', 'identity', 'little', 'way', 'big', 'budget', 'battle', 'scenes', 'battles', 'are', 'most', 'part', 'off', 'screen', 'yet', 'often', 'being', 'talking', 'heads', 'exercise', 'canvas', 'writ', 'large', 'giving', 'impression', 'times', 'really', 'are', 'looking', 'window', 'times', 'rather', 'cleaned', 'up', 'portrayal', 'it.Recommended', 'interested', 'pivotal', 'time', 'history', 'interested', 'development', 'fascinating', 'character']",John Adams

So it's very refreshing to see a serious and well-funded attempt like this one. The period color, costumes, sets, and backgrounds are all first-rate (though in too many cases the clothing doesn't really look lived in), and the historical research seems at least well-intentioned, if not quite as exhaustive as it might have been. There are some odd choices, however. For example, the battles at Concord and Lexington are not depicted, only their aftermath. I can't imagine why the filmmakers would choose not to include that. It can't be a budgetary decision; those battles are re-enacted every year in painstaking detail in Concord and Lexington, entirely by volunteers. (And while still on the subject of clothing, many of those volunteers have their costumes made by the same companies in England that made the originals, and every last button is authentic. I'm guessing that the filmmakers did not go to those lengths.) That battle was, of course, the pivotal moment in the whole story, and to leave it out and deal with it only in passing is inexplicable.Even more inexplicable is the choice to cast Paul Giamatti as John Adams. I can't think of any actor who would have been lower on my list of options for that role. Giammati is a likable enough actor in the right role. He excels at playing indecisive, shuffling losers, and in those roles we warm to him, because it seems like he's at home there, and we identify with those qualities in ourselves. But this role calls for someone morally unequivocal, intellectually indomitable, and utterly forceful. Adams was reluctant to be a rebel because he was so rational and had such faith in the law's principles, but Giamatti plays him as uncertain, which is a very different thing. He also plays Adams with lots of gushy emotion, almost like an Italian opera character, where Adams' actions and writings indicate a man who was intense in his beliefs, rather than in touch with his feelings. Again, a world of difference. In almost every scene Giamatti hits exactly the wrong note, like a tap-dancing monk. And since the whole story turns on his character, it brings the entire production down. It's really too bad, because it will probably be a long while before we get another serious attempt to address this topic. In the meantime, if you're interested in this subject, let me suggest that you visit Concord on Patriot's Day this April, and see what it was really about--especially if you think the Tea Party yahoos have even a faint clue about their inspiration.",3,"A good effort, but with the wrong actor",1286236800,"10 5, 2010",2010,2821,"['always', 'been', 'mystery', 'why', 'are', 'thousands', 'movies', 'World', 'War', 'II', 'only', 'handful', 'can', 'think', 'more', 'six', 'American', 'Revolution', 'fact', 'revolution', 'was', 'many', 'ways', 'more', 'dramatic', 'event', 'one', 'outcome', 'changed', 'country', 'earth', 'very', 'refreshing', 'see', 'serious', 'well-funded', 'attempt', 'one', 'period', 'color', 'costumes', 'sets', 'backgrounds', 'are', 'first-rate', 'too', 'many', 'cases', 'clothing', ""n't"", 'really', 'look', 'lived', 'historical', 'research', 'least', 'well-intentioned', 'not', 'quite', 'as', 'exhaustive', 'might', 'have', 'been', 'are', 'odd', 'choices', 'however', 'example', 'battles', 'Concord', 'Lexington', 'are', 'not', 'depicted', 'only', 'aftermath', 'ca', ""n't"", 'imagine', 'why', 'filmmakers', 'would', 'choose', 'not', 'include', 'ca', ""n't"", 'be', 'budgetary', 'decision', 'battles', 'are', 're-enacted', 'year', 'painstaking', 'detail', 'Concord', 'Lexington', 'entirely', 'volunteers', 'still', 'subject', 'clothing', 'many', 'volunteers', 'have', 'costumes', 'made', 'same', 'companies', 'England', 'made', 'originals', 'last', 'button', 'authentic', ""'m"", 'guessing', 'filmmakers', 'did', 'not', 'go', 'lengths', 'battle', 'was', 'course', 'pivotal', 'moment', 'whole', 'story', 'leave', 'out', 'deal', 'only', 'passing', 'inexplicable.Even', 'more', 'inexplicable', 'choice', 'cast', 'Paul', 'Giamatti', 'John', 'Adams', 'ca', ""n't"", 'think', 'actor', 'who', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'lower', 'list', 'options', 'role', 'Giammati', 'likable', 'enough', 'actor', 'right', 'role', 'playing', 'indecisive', 'shuffling', 'losers', 'roles', 'warm', 'home', 'there', 'identify', 'qualities', 'role', 'someone', 'morally', 'unequivocal', 'intellectually', 'indomitable', 'utterly', 'forceful', 'Adams', 'was', 'reluctant', 'be', 'rebel', 'was', 'so', 'rational', 'had', 'such', 'faith', 'law', 'principles', 'Giamatti', 'uncertain', 'very', 'different', 'thing', 'also', 'Adams', 'lots', 'gushy', 'emotion', 'almost', 'Italian', 'opera', 'character', 'where', 'Adams', 'actions', 'writings', 'indicate', 'man', 'who', 'was', 'intense', 'beliefs', 'rather', 'touch', 'feelings', 'Again', 'world', 'difference', 'almost', 'scene', 'Giamatti', 'exactly', 'wrong', 'note', 'tap-dancing', 'monk', 'whole', 'story', 'character', 'entire', 'production', 'down', 'really', 'too', 'bad', 'will', 'probably', 'be', 'long', 'while', 'get', 'serious', 'attempt', 'address', 'topic', 'meantime', ""'re"", 'interested', 'subject', 'let', 'suggest', 'visit', 'Concord', 'Patriot', 'Day', 'April', 'see', 'what', 'was', 'really', 'about', 'especially', 'think', 'Tea', 'Party', 'yahoos', 'have', 'even', 'faint', 'clue', 'inspiration']",John Adams

Adams didn't &#34;out-argue&#34; anyone and convince them but rather King George and Lord North suspended the rights of Englishmen which were won in the English Civil War. Once they did that, a declaration of independence was inevitable. The war was won because Washington fought it and Franklin turned it into a world war. Adams had very little role. I think he was chosen because of his extensive writings to draw from and the fact he didn't own slaves as if audiences are too stupid to compartmentalize that aspect of an 18th century figure. Paul Giamatti is an amazing actor and really encompasses the role. The mannerisms and the formal ways of speaking are really shown. However, Adams's traditionalist Christianity is very much downplayed here. It has become a standard to overemphasize Jefferson's deism in his younger days and downplay the  fact that most of the founders were traditional Christians.

Then it attempts to change their beliefs about the country's founding.The viewer is led to believe the content is historically accurate. The producer claims it is based on John McCullough's biography,John Adams.It isn't long before something doesn't seem right, raises a red flag or is simply ludicrous.This episode centers on the conflict between the British occupation and the colonists, focusing on the Massachusetts Militia.  Efforts to end Taxation Without Representation are unsuccessful.  The British tighten their grip.  Tensions heighten as the British attempt to exercise greater control over the colonies by imposing new taxes to pay off the substantial war debt they incurred against France.After the Boston Massacre, Adams takes a principled stand for justice in choosing to defend the British soldiers, putting him at odds with members of the Militia, including his cousin, Samuel Adams.The Militia is portrayed as a group of extremist rabble rousers who were too uncivilized to govern themselves.  In one very disturbing scene, a ship's captain is tarred and feathered at the instigation of Samuel Adams.  This scene maligns Samuel Adams and engenders sympathy for British rule over the thuggish lot.  It never happened.John Adams is presented as a reluctant member of the Militia at odds with his uncivilized cousin and remaining on the fringes of the cause until things got ugly.  This is inaccurate.The significant investment in the creation of this series, its entertainment value, popularity or mere existence may influence the viewer to assume that what is being presented is true.  Yet these and other inaccuracies exist in the historical timeline and important facts, including derogatory portrayals of the Founders.  It does not adhere to McCullogh's work, either.

1109663,A4MEPI81JCB85,B000WGWQG8,PAUL,"[0, 0]","Now that I have seen the whole of this mini serie, I'm still more impressed that the first time I wrote an opinion for this dvd.I bought this product on Amazon.com, because when I learned the existence of this mini-serie by watching the Emmy Awards on a French channel, the subject seemed interesting for me, but there was no way at this time to see it in France : John Adams is an American President fully unknown in our country, and it wouldn't be commercial to air it or to release such a dvd in stores. Now in March 2011, we begin to see it on small cable channels TV and two or three copies in retail stores.As for foreigners, it doen't present problem : the serie is subtitled (at least in French) and so is the first extra (but not the making of). Each episode is very long to see ; the average length is more than 1 hour, and you have to see it twice to read the English subtitles giving the historical context of what is narrated.According to my opinion, the performance of Paul Giamatti and other actors is quite remarkable. The box set is very beautiful with its golden yellow.I spoke about this serie with a French friend of mine working in the US who saw it on American TV : he was astonished that during this second US Administration, there was a war between France and the US. Almost nobody in France knows something about this war. I told him that according my poor knowledge, two wars confronted France and the US : the one of 1797-1798, and one on the 8th of November 1942 in Casablanca, Morocco. On both cases, the French army was defeated by the US. I told him also that it was during John Adam's administration, and because of this war, that the US Navy and the Marine Corps were created and are still existing today.My friend concluded that he had to read an history of the United States to have a better knowledge of the country where he is working now !For the same reasons, I encourage more French people to buy this miniserie DVD. Obviously you have to be interested in history. But first it's an enthusiastic performance,specially the one of Paul Giamatti and also of the actress performing the character of Abigail, and second they will learn historical facts not taught in French schools.Frankly speaking, we don't see much of the first US-French war, but on the opposite we can see Ben Franklin, Thomas Jefferson and Adams in Versailles. and if this mini serie was composed only of this part, it would be enough to say that it's far superior to Sofia Copplola's movie about Marie-Antoinette, queen of France.But apart of this, I learnt a lot of interesting items such as the way the Declaration of Independance was signed, how they treated smallpox or breast cancer in the 18th century. And more surprising than anything else, how a Chief Executive of the USA could walk alone in infamous parts of Philadelphia to meet his son.Who could imagine such things for a US President today ?Conclusion : buy it and you will have enriched your knowledge for quite a reasonable price !",5,An entusiastic way  of learning history,1245888000,"06 25, 2009",2009,3005,"['Now', 'have', 'seen', 'whole', 'mini', 'serie', ""'m"", 'still', 'more', 'impressed', 'first', 'time', 'wrote', 'opinion', 'dvd.I', 'bought', 'product', 'Amazon.com', 'when', 'learned', 'existence', 'mini-serie', 'watching', 'Emmy', 'Awards', 'French', 'channel', 'subject', 'seemed', 'interesting', 'was', 'way', 'time', 'see', 'France', 'John', 'Adams', 'American', 'President', 'fully', 'unknown', 'country', 'would', ""n't"", 'be', 'commercial', 'air', 'release', 'dvd', 'stores', 'Now', 'March', '2011', 'begin', 'see', 'small', 'cable', 'channels', 'TV', 'two', 'three', 'copies', 'retail', 'stores.As', 'foreigners', 'doe', ""n't"", 'present', 'problem', 'serie', 'subtitled', 'least', 'French', 'so', 'first', 'extra', 'not', 'making', 'episode', 'very', 'long', 'see', 'average', 'length', 'more', '1', 'hour', 'have', 'see', 'twice', 'read', 'English', 'subtitles', 'giving', 'historical', 'context', 'what', 'narrated.According', 'opinion', 'performance', 'Paul', 'Giamatti', 'other', 'actors', 'quite', 'remarkable', 'box', 'set', 'very', 'beautiful', 'golden', 'yellow.I', 'spoke', 'serie', 'French', 'friend', 'mine', 'working', 'US', 'who', 'saw', 'American', 'TV', 'was', 'astonished', 'second', 'US', 'Administration', 'was', 'war', 'France', 'US', 'Almost', 'nobody', 'France', 'something', 'war', 'told', 'according', 'poor', 'knowledge', 'two', 'wars', 'confronted', 'France', 'US', 'one', '1797-1798', 'one', '8th', 'November', '1942', 'Casablanca', 'Morocco', 'cases', 'French', 'army', 'was', 'defeated', 'US', 'told', 'also', 'was', 'John', 'Adam', 'administration', 'war', 'US', 'Navy', 'Marine', 'Corps', 'were', 'created', 'are', 'still', 'existing', 'today.My', 'friend', 'concluded', 'had', 'read', 'history', 'United', 'States', 'have', 'better', 'knowledge', 'country', 'where', 'working', 'now', 'same', 'reasons', 'encourage', 'more', 'French', 'people', 'buy', 'miniserie', 'DVD', 'Obviously', 'have', 'be', 'interested', 'history', 'first', 'enthusiastic', 'performance', 'specially', 'one', 'Paul', 'Giamatti', 'also', 'actress', 'performing', 'character', 'Abigail', 'second', 'will', 'learn', 'historical', 'facts', 'not', 'taught', 'French', 'schools.Frankly', 'speaking', 'do', ""n't"", 'see', 'much', 'first', 'US-French', 'war', 'opposite', 'can', 'see', 'Ben', 'Franklin', 'Thomas', 'Jefferson', 'Adams', 'Versailles', 'mini', 'serie', 'was', 'composed', 'only', 'part', 'would', 'be', 'enough', 'say', 'far', 'superior', 'Sofia', 'Copplola', 'movie', 'Marie-Antoinette', 'queen', 'France.But', 'apart', 'learnt', 'lot', 'interesting', 'items', 'such', 'way', 'Declaration', 'Independance', 'was', 'signed', 'how', 'treated', 'smallpox', 'breast', 'cancer', '18th', 'century', 'more', 'surprising', 'anything', 'else', 'how', 'Chief', 'Executive', 'USA', 'could', 'walk', 'alone', 'infamous', 'parts', 'Philadelphia', 'meet', 'son.Who', 'could', 'imagine', 'such', 'things', 'US', 'President', 'today', 'Conclusion', 'buy', 'will', 'have', 'enriched', 'knowledge', 'quite', 'reasonable', 'price']",John Adams

It's clear that this was the overriding intent of the producers. The scenes of John and Abigail attempting to live in the desolate and half completed executive mansion were terrific.2) the acting is superb. Giamatti is one of the best, if not the best, character actors in the business. His ability to move from the understated to the explosive and back again is extraordinary. Stephen Dillane was excellent in capturing Jefferson's ethereal personality (his contemporaries, pro and con, all agreed on this characteristic of his). Tom Wilkenson as Franklin reveling in French hedonism was a delight.A couple of corrections I would make.a) Hamilton was not given enough attention, given his crucial role in the early republic and his efforts towards the adoption of the Constitution (i.e. through The Federalist Papers, which were Hamilton's idea). Jefferson is accurately portrayed as brilliant, but Hamilton was a certifiable genius. Here instead he's portrayed as a meglomaniac.b) The short portrayal of Louis XVI was innaccurate. He's shown more as a spoiled pampered child than in fact a middle aged man at the time with a warm personality and insightful mind. The irony of history is that the French Revolutionists chopped off the head of a man who was, by the standards of the time, a good monarch.

1109678,A2VODABWSVHV8E,B000WGWQG8,"Ray ""A Reader""","[1, 1]","Most American children grow up learning the basic facts about the American Revolution, and can provide a general description of the Revolution in broad brush strokes. Some can go a little further, recounting more detailed information of specific portions of this history that might for some reason hold a special interest to them. What most Americans cannot do, however, is retell the story in chronological sequence from beginning to end, describing the specific role of each of the major persons who had a part in that story, and the interrelationships that make the story so unique.If you think that's what this series is about, you'd be wrong. It's not that you can't see the entire story play itself out - you most certainly will - but that you will rather learn the truth of the statement that a person can ""get all the facts right, and miss the point entirely."" And perhaps this is where this most outstanding of documentaries on early American history excels, the ability to tell the story of the life of John Adams, while learning the facts surrounding the American Revolution only as they surrounded John Adams himself. And perhaps, for subject matter like this, the approach is one of the best one could take.The John Adams series lays out the seminal events of the American Revolution as John Adams viewed and participated in them (and he did participate in nearly every aspect of it throughout his long life), but allows us to do so  while experiencing the context through the outstanding storytelling and precise recreation of the period. We don't only witness the events; we are made to feel that we experience them, and find ourselves being transported into a world that in so many ways differs from our own. Along the way, the series makes us face the wrongs and unpleasantries of the era, but the focus is strictly on the rise of the American nation out of the individual colonies.The acting in this series is superb. Giamatti has perhaps given the performance of his career, and Laura Linney portrays Abigail Adams in such a sublime way that the character is strongly portrayed without overshadowing the story. Other characters (Jefferson, McHenry, Hamilton, and so on) are also excellently cast and acted, with the commanding presence of George Washington (David Morse) and the political creature Benjamin Franklin (Tom Wilkinson) played so impressively as to make one forget these are actors. To watch ""John Adams"" is to be introduced to each of these persons in a way never before thought possible.The series runs for seven episodes, for a total run time of just over eight hours. The filming itself is generally excellent, with some special effects that are well executed and quite realistic. There are some issues with the choice to employ odd camera angles and some hand-held scenes, sometimes which almost threatens to produce vertigo in the viewer, and have made more than one reviewer pan the series for these approaches to filmography. Although I, too, had trouble in some of these scenes (particularly in episode two, where it seems to be most frequently used), I can easily say not to let this affect your decision to watch the series. These are just quibbles, and in some cases, we can easily argue that these techniques help create the sense of ""reality"" that is needed to keep us fixated on the time period. The scenes depicting Paris and the Netherlands of the period are particularly fascinating.The music in the series is also outstanding. Anyone who watched the ""Rome"" series by HBO will undoubtedly recognize the similarities of the the opening title sequence, but I must say that this title sequence is one of the best I've ever seen. The music and visuals in the sequence are dramatic, lush, and even haunting.I've often thought that, from an educational standpoint, the American Revolution was similar to the French Revolution in that the number of people, the philosophical positions, the debates, the diverse background information, and other factors are so extensive and varied that it can make learning anything beyond the basic history quite challenging. Without building context, without knowing the history and biographical information of the major personages, without knowing the history leading up to the event, trying to place the epochal events in order so they make sense and can be examined is a tremendous task. And so, we end up with what we commonly see, people who know the broad brush strokes of the narrative, but would have trouble distinguishing between Danton and Robespierre, between Hamilton and Jefferson, between The Stamp Act and The Aliens and Seditions Act, or between the National Assembly and the National Constituent Assembly. And that's not to be critical: these events involved dozens of main players, took place over a period of multiple years, and involved the clash of deeply held beliefs about the nature of governance and the role of ""rights."" This is not like learning a simple fact of history. But a series like this one can help overcome these issues by laying the foundation for a much deeper, ongoing exploration of early American history.To sum it up, this is one of the most superb documentaries I've ever seen. To watch it is to learn about John Adams and the role he played in the emergence of the United States, to learn about the American Revolution itself, and to become a participant in the debates, quarrels, and yes, politics, of the event. Its a powerful and moving story that evokes deep emotions and stimulates intense thought about America's founding. It's nothing less than a tour de force.",5,The American Revolution as You've Not Seen It Before,1215043200,"07 3, 2008",2008,5591,"['Most', 'American', 'children', 'grow', 'up', 'learning', 'basic',

1109693,AUM3YMZ0YRJE0,B000WGWQG8,Robert J. Crawford,"[2, 3]","HBO continues to amaze me with its mini-series.  With the depth of personality development and historical (or in the case of The Wire, current events) accuracy, they develop stories and ideas that I have never seen so finely achieved in any other fictional film media.  This series in many ways is even better than Rome - less melodramatic, a better treatment of the issues, and a wider historical canvass.This is essentially a bio-pic of one of the neglected founding fathers.  Starting with his career as a shrewdly ambitious lawyer in the British colony, we witness Adams as he becomes a revolutionary, following his more radical cousin, Sam Adams.  He established his national career by defending the troops who fired upon colonial subjects in the Boston Massacre:  he was impartial, relied on the law rather than mob rule, and on the street meticulously put together his case, which showcased his political skills.  His court victory, shown with high drama, got the attention of some of the best minds of the age, getting him into the original continental congress as a delegate, leading next to his ambassadorship in France and then Holland.  In each locale, we get a wonderful window into the local society:  it is funny, evokes the political culture, and portrays the evolution of the characters in it (i.e. Franklin, Adams, and Jefferson).  Upon return to the US, Adams is chosen as VP to Washington, then the second President.While you get a great sketch of Adams' career in context, the film does not shy away from showing Adams' warts, and there were many.  He was an irascible presence, concerned more with ideas - his idea of what was right - than the practical realities of politics.  Interestingly, as the US was in formation, this was in many ways needed:  he was setting precedents as he went along, which other would emulate.  However, this meant that he was not the kind of politician you would want at the top, at least in my reading, as he often couldn't compromise and confused being right with getting things done or at least preserving the potential to do so in the future.In addition, those around Adams are given a depth of treatment that is sadly lacking in the supporting characters in most historical films.  Abigail, Adams' political anchor and partner in love, is by far the best character, but there are also their children, many of whom had troubled lives, perhaps due in no small part to Adams' rigidity.  Jefferson is particularly subtle:  a brilliant and charismatic man, you can sense he is always operating in accordance with his own political calculus, though he is and was a good friend to Adams before becoming his worst political enemy; while conservative in terms of limiting the power of the federal government, he was also a radical democrat in favor of the French revolution and advocating a new constitution for every generation.  Franklin is also wonderful as a protean adaptor who revels in his environment; he was often at odds with Adams in terms of method and life style, but respected and then then used him to higher purpose.  There is a hilarious scene where his relationship with Madame Helvetius is made clear to an outraged Adams.  These portraits jibe wonderfully with my own research into these fascinating pols, who frankly ran rings around Adams in his rigid righteousness.  Finally, there is Washington himself, the great unifier, whose work takes place for the most part off stage.  The actors for all of these characters are absolutely first rate.To be honest, I was a bit wary of this purchasing this.  Though I greatly admire McCullough's writing powers, I think at heart that he is a sentimentalist, giving a kind of softball version of mythic American figures without enough context or skepticism.  I have not read his Adams book and will, for in this series I happily found I was wrong about his limitations.  Unfortunately, the accompanying mini-documentary shows him as a self-satisfied, if consciously humble, everyman who wants to produce literature as popular history (at which he definitely succeeds, don't get me wrong); he goes on and on about how happy he is, what a charmed life and marriage he had, etc., in the silliest kind of hagiography that exemplifies the sentimental mythmaking that I find an utter bore.Warmly recommended.

1109694,A2XRMQA6PJ5ZJ8,B000WGWQG8,Roger J. Buffington,"[1, 1]","John Adams was one of the Founding Fathers, the greatness of whom was appreciated at the time, although more so after his death as historians examined his life with the benefit of historical perspective.  This miniseries is based upon David McCulloch's acclaimed biography of John Adams, and it is a faithful, and even loving, recreation of the story of John Adams' remarkable life.The miniseries takes us from the time of the Boston Massacre to the American Revolution, to the founding of America and through its early years as a fledgling nation.  Mr. Adams was there for almost all of it.  Adams was defense counsel for the British redcoats who were tried for, and aquitted of, murder for their actions in the Boston Massacre.  He then was a firebrand delegate to the Continental Congress as an outspoken advocate for American independence, a radical idea at the time.  This film explores all of this and provides insight into Mr. Adams' ideals, and his well-known outspokeness and stubborness.  It also explores his relationship and partnership with his wife Abigail, who history records was his full political partner and confidant throughout his career.I particularly enjoyed the film's treatment of Adams' relationship with Thomas Jefferson.  Friends, then bitter political adversaries who later reconciled their friendship.  I might have enjoyed an even more thorough exploration of this dynamic.  The interaction between Benjamin Franklin and John Adams is similarly fascinating, and is one of the high points of the miniseries.The film's review of Adams' single term as America's second president was very interesting, and it is consistent with McCulloch's (and modern historians') analysis of the Adams administration.  Adams' great accomplishment as president was keeping America neutral in the war between Britain and France and in avoiding war with France.No review would be complete without commenting on the theme music for this miniseries.  It is vibrant and inspiring.  Some films benefit immensely from a stirring musical score and this is one of them.This is not a perfect film.  Like many a miniseries, it might have benefited from a bit more editing.  Adams' family problems (he had them, just like almost all families do) probably could have been handled with more brevity with no sacrifice of clarity.  Likewise the various medical issues upon which the film dwells.  In its defense, one must say that this piece reminds the viewer that our forefathers lived in a tough and dangerous time, when a serious illness meant death much more often than is the case today.  Any study of the lives of the people of that era cannot but notice the significant role that disease and illness played.The American Revolution and its ideals are vital knowledge that our schools do a poor job of providing to our young people.  This film is both excellent entertainment and a superb look at one of the giants of American history.",5,A remarkable man  who lived a remarkable life--the story of one of America's Founding Fathers,1241913600,"05 10, 2009",2009,2936,"['John', 'Adams', 'was', 'one', 'Founding', 'Fathers', 'greatness', 'whom', 'was', 'appreciated', 'time', 'more', 'so', 'death', 'historians', 'examined', 'life', 'benefit', 'historical', 'perspective', 'miniseries', 'based', 'David', 'McCulloch', 'acclaimed', 'biography', 'John', 'Adams', 'faithful', 'even', 'loving', 'recreation', 'story', 'John', 'Adams', 'remarkable', 'life.The', 'miniseries', 'time', 'Boston', 'Massacre', 'American', 'Revolution', 'founding', 'America', 'early', 'years', 'fledgling', 'nation', 'Mr.', 'Adams', 'was', 'almost', 'Adams', 'was', 'defense', 'counsel', 'British', 'redcoats', 'who', 'were', 'tried', 'aquitted', 'murder', 'actions', 'Boston', 'Massacre', 'then', 'was', 'firebrand', 'delegate', 'Continental', 'Congress', 'outspoken', 'advocate', 'American', 'independence', 'radical', 'idea', 'time', 'film', 'insight', 'Mr.', 'Adams', 'ideals', 'well-known', 'outspokeness', 'stubborness', 'also', 'relationship', 'partnership', 'wife', 'Abigail', 'who', 'history', 'records', 'was', 'full', 'political', 'partner', 'confidant', 'career.I', 'particularly', 'enjoyed', 'film', 'treatment', 'Adams', 'relationship', 'Thomas', 'Jefferson', 'Friends', 'then', 'bitter', 'political', 'adversaries', 'who', 'later', 'reconciled', 'friendship', 'might', 'have', 'enjoyed', 'even', 'more', 'thorough', 'exploration', 'dynamic', 'interaction', 'Benjamin', 'Franklin', 'John', 'Adams', 'similarly', 'fascinating', 'one', 'high', 'points', 'miniseries.The', 'film', 'review', 'Adams', 'single', 'term', 'America', 'second', 'president', 'was', 'very', 'interesting', 'consistent', 'McCulloch', 'modern', 'historians', 'analysis', 'Adams', 'administration', 'Adams', 'great', 'accomplishment', 'president', 'was', 'keeping', 'America', 'neutral', 'war', 'Britain', 'France', 'avoiding', 'war', 'France.No', 'review', 'would', 'be', 'complete', 'commenting', 'theme', 'music', 'miniseries', 'vibrant', 'inspiring', 'films', 'benefit', 'immensely', 'stirring', 'musical', 'score', 'one', 'them.This', 'not', 'perfect', 'film', 'many', 'miniseries', 'might', 'have', 'benefited', 'bit', 'more', 'editing', 'Adams', 'family', 'problems', 'had', 'just', 'almost', 'families', 'do', 'probably', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'handled', 'more', 'brevity', 'sacrifice', 'clarity', 'Likewise', 'various', 'medical', 'issues', 'film', 'dwells', 'defense', 'one', 'must', 'say', 'piece', 'viewer', 'forefathers', 'lived', 'tough', 'dangerous', 'time', 'when', 'serious', 'illness', 'meant', 'death', 'much', 'more', 'often', 'case', 'today', 'study', 'lives', 'people', 'era', 'can', 'not', 'notice', 'significant', 'role', 'disease', 'illness', 'played.The', 'American', 'Revolution', 'ideals', 'are', 'vital', 'knowledge', 'schools', 'do', 'poor', 'job', 'providing', 'young', 'people', 'film', 'excellent', 'entertainment', 'superb', 'look', 'one', 'giants', 'American', 'history']",John Adams

John Adams introduces us to the fundamental conflict underneath the Amercian reality; are we revolutionaries, or monarchists? The course that America took during George Washington's presidency is the reason why we are where we are today. John Adams is the man portrayed as the Founder caught in between Jefferson and Hamilton, the two poles of thinking as to who America should side with and invest in. Ultimately we sided with the monarchists, and it should surprise no one that we have ended up with a unitary executive like George Bush, a monarch in all but title.Had Jefferson not left America and taken over from Washington, we could have supported the French, because they were our true ideological allies. Plus, we owed them. But America has a knack for siding with the morally wrong side of politics, and this trait has persisted thru the centuries. Looking at our present thru the lens of the past is crucial, and this mini series spells it out. A masterpiece and a triumph.

Among many other things that other reviewers have rightly applauded, the producers skillfully captured the subtle changes in dress and culture over the decades covered by this epic.But, alas, here are my four biggest gripes:First, most of the dialogue is whispered rather than spoken.  I had to turn the volume way up to hear it.Second, the cameraman has the annoying habit of deliberately shaking the camera, especially in the earlier episodes.  He really wants you to know that the camera is hand-held.Third, the portrayal of Abigail Adams is hokey throughout.  She is presented as an all-patient, all-knowing pillar of quiet strength and wisdom for her husband who, unlike her, comes across as a mere, whiney mortal.  Laura Linney, the actress who plays Abigail, keeps her brow frozen in an uncomfortable-looking expression of pain and forbearance that must have given her a headache.  It didn't take long for me to get tired of looking at her.Fourth, the scene of the Adamses copulating shortly after Abigail's arrival in France is gratuitous, as is the needless non-erotic shot of their daughter's breast in the final episode.

This movie truly has its outstanding moments, BUT.......be prepared for Balonywoods scripted psychohistory moments.  Case in point the visual scene of the sex activity between Adams and his wife Abigail when she arrived in Paris. And the bare breast when Adam's daughter was being preped for cancer surgery.  Add too such dialogue woven into the script itself.The most egregious Balonywood's moment came in the depictation of Thomas Jefferson and his often repeated but untrue relationship with Sally Hemings. Sally Hemings was a slave and a maid to Jeferson's daughter Polly.  Jefferson last saw Sally when she was 11 or twelve. She acompanied Polly when Polly came to Paris to be with her father.  At that time Sally was about 14, incompetant and needed someone to take care of her.  Abigail Adams who was aboard ship the same time as Polly and her maid, wrote Jefferson concerning Sally: ""The girl she has with her wants more care than the child, and is wholly incapable of looking properly after her without some superior to direct her.""During Jefferson's lifetime he fell in love with two womem -  his adored wife Martha, who passed away, and a beautiful accomplished woman in France named Maria Cosewell.The case for Sally having been Jefferson's mistress is based largely on the writing/charges of James Callender, a nortorious dealer in character assassination who was employed by Jefferson's political enemies during his first term as president of the United States in 1873.  Unfortunately for our generation the infamous psycohistory buff/witer Fawn Brodie took up these charges and magnified them. She and others say they have proof in that certain slaves at Monticello are said to have borne a resemblance to Jefferson. Those who want to believe Jefferson himself is responsible ignore that two of Jefferson's nephews Peter and Samual Carr lived at Montecello and that one, Samuel, had confessed that he had fathered some of Sally's progeny.  Jeferson's grandaughter Ellen Randolph called her cousin Samuel ""the most nortorius good-natured Turk that ever was master of a black seraglio (harem) kept at other men's expense."" For this movie to pertetuate the lie/myth of Sally and Jefferson romantic involvelment -  and that she was at his bedside when he died does an injustice to Jefferson and to Sally Hemmings.If one can bear these psychohistory interjections/myths/dialogue and scenes; along with the actor depicting John Adams speaking with a wad of cotton in his mouth it is balonywood intertaining striving to be its best - but in fact missing the mark!",1,baloneywood vs truth,1338854400,"06 5, 2012",2012,3135,"['one', 'keenly', 'interested', 'American', 'Histoy', 'reason', 'DVD', 'John', 'Adams', 'was', 'purchased', 'David', 'McCullough', 'commentator', 'historian', 'sorts', 'rated', 'high', 'ones', 'opininon', 'when', 'name', 'Tom', 'Hanks', 'was', 'mentioned', 'was', 'oh', 'oh', 'beware', 'Balonywood', 'may', 'be', 'par', 'course', 'so', 'called', 'historical', 'movie', 'may', 'be', 'injected', 'psychohistory', 'distorting', 'story', 'John', 'Admas', 'contribution', 'founding', 'government.Balonywood', 'usualy', 'always', 'two', 'things', 'making', 'movie', 'visual', 'sexuality', 'nudity', 'movie', 'truly', 'outstanding', 'moments', 'BUT', '.be', 'prepared', 'Balonywoods', 'scripted', 'psychohistory', 'moments', 'Case', 'point', 'visual', 'scene', 'sex', 'activity', 'Adams', 'wife', 'Abigail', 'when', 'arrived', 'Paris', 'bare', 'breast', 'when', 'Adam', 'daughter', 'was', 'being', 'preped', 'cancer', 'surgery', 'Add', 'too', 'such', 'dialogue', 'woven', 'script', 'most', 'egregious', 'Balonywood', 'moment', 'came', 'depictation', 'Thomas', 'Jefferson', 'often', 'repeated', 'untrue', 'relationship', 'Sally', 'Hemings', 'Sally', 'Hemings', 'was', 'slave', 'maid', 'Jeferson', 'daughter', 'Polly', 'Jefferson', 'last', 'saw', 'Sally', 'when', 'was', '11', 'twelve', 'acompanied', 'Polly', 'when', 'Polly', 'came', 'Paris', 'be', 'father', 'time', 'Sally', 'was', '14', 'incompetant', 'needed', 'someone', 'take', 'care', 'Abigail', 'Adams', 'who', 'was', 'aboard', 'same', 'time', 'Polly', 'maid', 'wrote', 'Jefferson', 'concerning', 'Sally', 'girl', 'more', 'care', 'child', 'wholly', 'incapable', 'looking', 'properly', 'superior', 'direct', 'Jefferson', 'lifetime', 'fell', 'love', 'two', 'womem', 'adored', 'wife', 'Martha', 'who', 'passed', 'away', 'beautiful', 'accomplished', 'woman', 'France', 'named', 'Maria', 'Cosewell.The', 'case', 'Sally', 'having', 'been', 'Jefferson', 'mistress', 'based', 'largely', 'writing/charges', 'James', 'Callender', 'nortorious', 'dealer', 'character', 'assassination', 'who', 'was', 'employed', 'Jefferson', 'political', 'enemies', 'first', 'term', 'president', 'United', 'States', '1873', 'Unfortunately', 'generation', 'infamous', 'psycohistory', 'buff/witer', 'Fawn', 'Brodie', 'took', 'up', 'charges', 'magnified', 'others', 'say', 'have', 'proof', 'certain', 'slaves', 'Monticello', 'are', 'said', 'have', 'borne', 'resemblance', 'Jefferson', 'who', 'want', 'believe', 'Jefferson', 'responsible', 'ignore', 'two', 'Jefferson', 'nephews', 'Peter', 'Samual', 'Carr', 'lived', 'Montecello', 'one', 'Samuel', 'had', 'confessed', 'had', 'fathered', 'Sally', 'progeny', 'Jeferson', 'grandaughter', 'Ellen', 'Randolph', 'called', 'cousin', 'Samuel', 'most', 'nortorius', 'good-natured', 'Turk', 'ever', 'was', 'master', 'black', 'seraglio', 'harem', 'kept', 'other', 'men', 'expense', 'movie', 'pertetuate', 'lie/myth', 'Sally', 'Jefferson', 'romantic', 'involvelment', 'was', 'bedside', 'when', 'died', 'injustice', 'Jefferson', 'Sally', 'Hemmings.If', 'one', 'can', 'bear', 'psychohistory', 'interjections/myths/dialogue', 'scenes', 'actor', 'depicting', 'John', 'Adams', 'speaking', 'wad', 'cotton', 'mouth', 'balonywood', 'intertaining', 'striving', 'be', 'best', 'fact', 'missing', 'mark']",John Adams

1109709,A2PNTEDGMOLMOY,B000WGWQG8,Scott Schiefelbein,"[2, 2]","HBO continues to produce some of the best TV around.  From ""The Sopranos"" to ""The Wire"" to ""Rome"" to ""Deadwood,"" the cable channel is doing something extremely right.  Add ""John Adams"" to the list of great television events brought about by these folks.Paul Giamatti may have come to national attention as the lovable shlub Miles in ""Sideways,"" but John Adams provides Giamatti with the role of a lifetime in one of America's most important Founding Fathers.  Indeed, the unwritten subtitle of this series could be, ""The Forgotten Founding Father.""By bringing to brilliant light the story of Adams' life and critical importance to our young nation, this series reminds us that it took more than Ben Franklin, George Washington, and Thomas Jefferson to give birth to our country.  (Of course, the series exercises its own form of prejudice by completely ignoring James Madison, who played more than a minor role in the whole business!)  Adams was a critical Massachusetts leader before the Revolution, he was a leader in the negotiation of the Declaration of Independence, he was a critical diplomat for the new country in Europe, and he provided crucial leadership as Vice President, President, and elder statesman.The strengths of this series are many, but stem primarily from relying heavily on David McCullough's stellar biography on Adams.  His ""rotundancy"" is shown as he was - warts and all.  Adams was a brilliant, vain, pompous, ambitious man, and yet he channeled so much of himself into forming and guiding our young nation that it is impossible to say that without Adams, there would not be a United States as we understand it today, and perhaps not at all.The movie also humanizes Adams.  We see his early struggles with the notion of independence as he takes the British side in the Boston Massacre, defending the British soldiers accused of murder even as his own cousin, Sam Adams, lobbies for their hanging.  John Adams is reluctant to break away from Britain as he sees America as dangerously close to mob rule.  His journey to ardent foe of Britain is a joy to watch.""John Adams"" could also be called ""The Adams Family.""  Laura Linney almost steals the movie with her performance as Adams' beloved and brilliant wife Abigail.  This self-educated woman was a paragon of virtue and wisdom, and her partnership with her husband elevated John to what he was to become.  These two experience more joys and sorrows in their 54-year marriage(!) than most families experience in several generations.  John and Abigail provide the emotional high points of the series, and there are many.  Their correspondence, including references to each other as ""Dearest Friend,"" are incredibly touching.Look for well-rounded performances from a wide cast of characters, but Giamatti and Linney remain the anchor for this first-rate production.  Stephen Dillane is particularly fine as Thomas Jefferson, Adams' friend, then nemesis, then friend.  Tom Wilkinson, as always, is excellent in his role as Ben Franklin.  Sarah Polley shines in her small role as Adams' darling daughter Nabby.  And Rufus Sewell makes for a satisfying ""villain"" in Alexander Hamilton, a huge thorn in Adams' plump side.This series should be required viewing for all high school students who want a realistic, warts-and-all depiction of the birth of our nation and the struggles and sacrifices (and triumphs) of one of the most important Americans who ever lived.

1109711,A73QPH7NGI0DJ,B000WGWQG8,Sean Curley,"[1, 1]","HBO's special miniseries and projects have been the gold standard in quality television productions in the last decade.  They have delivered many popular portrayals of American history, such as the notable mid-90s TV movie with Gary Sinise as Harry Truman, and the recent FDR bio ""Warm Springs"".  The former work made use of David McCullough's excellent biography, and now comes ""John Adams"", following McCullough's book the same.  The result is a quality production overall, though it is a bit slow in places.Adams was a major player in the American Revolution, and his contribution is deservedly celebrated here, though his life presents some challenges to filmmakers; in particular, he was not really a presence in the field (so no big battle scenes or such moments of martial heroics), so the main drag comes after the signing of the Declaration of Independence, when Adams is shuffled off to the Continent to impotently lobby for aid from Europe.The basic outline of the story begins in Boston in 1774, when lawyer John Adams is recruited by the British to defend the soldiers under arrest for the famous Boston Massacre, when protestors were gunned down.  The question is whether their captain gave the order to fire.  This first episode plays out like a legal drama; in episode two, the scene shifts to Philadelphia, and we get a new rendition of the familiar scenes of the Declaration being argued-over and drafted, and meet figures such as Benjamin Franklin and Thomas Jefferson.  Episode three, the weakest of the seven in my opinion, sees Adams in Frnace, doing little of consequence and bemoaning his separation from his beloved wife Abigail.  Adams his little talent for diplomacy or the foreign French court, and he often finds himself getting in the way of the more skilled Franklin.  Upon his return to the United States in the final episodes, he must deal with the maddeningly inconsequential role of the Vice President, the rivalry between Jefferson and Alexander Hamilton, his troubled presidency (with the focus being on the prospect of war with France), family squabbles (most of all his drunken failure of son, Charles), and, finally, his physical decline in retirement.The title role is essayed by Pail Giamatti, who is a rather interesting choice for the main character in a 19th century drama; he is not the sort of heroic type one might expect.  This is suited to the Adams of the story, who is, for all his positive qualities, frequently petty and short-sighted, given to bursts of anger.  His wife Abigail is played by Laura Linney, who sometimes skirts too close to being a stereotypical Supportive Wife, but other times is accorded more in the way of emotion and personality variance (and Linney is a great actress).  Other performances of note are Stephen Dillane as Jefferson and a drole Tom Wilson as Benjamin Franklin.Given that the story pans from 1774 to 1826, the actors require extensive use of age makeup, and the stuff used here is very good.  Giamatti, in particular, spends the last few episodes as an extremely believable elderly Adams.  Being HBO, the series makes a point of giving as 'realistic' a setting as possible, rather than the spotless look of movies like ""1776"".  Bad teeth abound as Adams grows older.  The series begins and ends with two especially memorable moments of period gruesomeness: the first, a grisly tarring-and-feathering of a British loyalist, the second a wince-inducing depiction of a 19th century mastectomy.There is a rather bizarre scene where Adams rants about historical inaccuracies in the depiction of the signing of the Declaration of Independence, which seems out of place, given that this miniseries takes liberties with history as the average production does (right down the Adams' rant itself, ironically, which he did not give).  It's hard to know what to make of that moment.Regardless, this is overall a very interesting piece of work.",4,HBO provides another quality historical drama.,1218931200,"08 17, 2008",2008,3922,"['HBO', 'special', 'miniseries', 'projects', 'have', 'been', 'gold', 'standard', 'quality', 'television', 'productions', 'last', 'decade', 'have', 'delivered', 'many', 'popular', 'portrayals', 'American', 'history', 'such', 'notable', 'mid-90s', 'TV', 'movie', 'Gary', 'Sinise', 'Harry', 'Truman', 'recent', 'FDR', 'bio', 'Warm', 'Springs', 'former', 'work', 'made', 'use', 'David', 'McCullough', 'excellent', 'biography', 'now', 'John', 'Adams', 'following', 'McCullough', 'book', 'same', 'result', 'quality', 'production', 'overall', 'bit', 'slow', 'places.Adams', 'was', 'major', 'player', 'American', 'Revolution', 'contribution', 'deservedly', 'celebrated', 'here', 'life', 'challenges', 'filmmakers', 'particular', 'was', 'not', 'really', 'presence', 'field', 'so', 'no', 'big', 'battle', 'scenes', 'such', 'moments', 'martial', 'heroics', 'main', 'drag', 'signing', 'Declaration', 'Independence', 'when', 'Adams', 'shuffled', 'off', 'Continent', 'impotently', 'lobby', 'aid', 'Europe.The', 'basic', 'outline', 'story', 'Boston', '1774', 'when', 'lawyer', 'John', 'Adams', 'recruited', 'British', 'defend', 'soldiers', 'arrest', 'famous', 'Boston', 'Massacre', 'when', 'protestors', 'were', 'gunned', 'down', 'question', 'captain', 'gave', 'order', 'fire', 'first', 'episode', 'out', 'legal', 'drama', 'episode', 'two', 'scene', 'shifts', 'Philadelphia', 'get', 'new', 'rendition', 'familiar', 'scenes', 'Declaration', 'being', 'argued-over', 'drafted', 'meet', 'figures', 'such', 'Benjamin', 'Franklin', 'Thomas', 'Jefferson', 'Episode', 'three', 'weakest', 'seven', 'opinion', 'Adams', 'Frnace', 'doing', 'little', 'consequence', 'bemoaning', 'separation', 'beloved', 'wife', 'Abigail', 'Adams', 'little', 'talent', 'diplomacy', 'foreign', 'French', 'court', 'often', 'getting', 'way', 'more', 'skilled', 'Franklin', 'return', 'United', 'States', 'final', 'episodes', 'must', 'deal', 'maddeningly', 'inconsequential', 'role', 'Vice', 'President', 'rivalry', 'Jefferson', 'Alexander', 'Hamilton', 'troubled', 'presidency', 'focus', 'being', 'prospect', 'war', 'France', 'family', 'squabbles', 'most', 'drunken', 'failure', 'son', 'Charles', 'finally', 'physical', 'decline', 'retirement.The', 'title', 'role', 'essayed', 'Pail', 'Giamatti', 'who', 'rather', 'interesting', 'choice', 'main', 'character', '19th', 'century', 'drama', 'not', 'sort', 'heroic', 'type', 'one', 'might', 'expect', 'suited', 'Adams', 'story', 'who', 'positive', 'qualities', 'frequently', 'petty', 'short-sighted', 'given', 'bursts', 'anger', 'wife', 'Abigail', 'played', 'Laura', 'Linney', 'who', 'sometimes', 'too', 'close', 'being', 'stereotypical', 'Supportive', 'Wife', 'other', 'times', 'accorded', 'more', 'way', 'emotion', 'personality', 'variance', 'Linney', 'great', 'actress', 'Other', 'performances', 'note', 'are', 'Stephen', 'Dillane', 'Jefferson', 'drole', 'Tom', 'Wilson', 'Benjamin', 'Franklin.Given', 'story', 'pans', '1774', '1826', 'actors', 'require', 'extensive', 'use', 'age', 'makeup', 'stuff', 'used', 'here', 'very', 'good', 'Giamatti', 'particular', 'last', 'few', 'episodes', 'extremely', 'believable', 'elderly', 'Adams', 'Being', 'HBO', 'series', 'point', 'giving', ""'realistic"", 'setting', 'possible', 'rather', 'spotless', 'look', 'movies', '1776', 'Bad', 'abound', 'Adams', 'older', 'series', 'two', 'especially', 'memorable', 'moments', 'period', 'gruesomeness', 'first', 'grisly', 'tarring-and-feathering', 'British', 'loyalist', 'second', 'wince-inducing', 'depiction', '19th', 'century', 'rather', 'bizarre', 'scene', 'where', 'Adams', 'historical', 'inaccuracies', 'depiction', 'signing', 'Declaration', 'Independence', 'place', 'given', 'miniseries', 'liberties', 'history', 'average', 'production', 'right', 'down', 'Adams', 'rant', 'ironically', 'did', 'not', 'give', 'hard', 'know', 'what', 'make', 'moment.Regardless', 'overall', 'very', 'interesting', 'piece', 'work']",John Adams

One actor pronounces Maryland as ""Mary Land,"" which always catches the English.  And shooting in Eastern Europe for Philly, etc. is always a joke.  Do producers think we don't notice?  Takes away from reality.It would be nice for once if HBO used American actors to portray American actors.  or to film movies where they take place.Stephen Dillon, playing Jefferson, showed no such passion.  I have not read the book yet but I have read bios of Franklin, Jefferson, Lafayette and the characters were real.  What it hints at but does not show is the duplicity of America in its early stages.  Helping England steal Canada from French while begging France for money (helping to bring down the fall of Louis and Marie because the support for the American Revolution drained France's bank).  So much double dealling and the US was not good at paying back it's supporters.Adams was a difficult person to be sure but this series shows him as a loser and depressive.  I doubt that he was depressive.Abigail had wits and brains and a voluminous correspondence with Jefferson over the years and had Patsy stay with her before she went on to join her father Jefferson in France.  Adams and Jefferson in their last years wrote extensively and became close.This series, for all its length, does not capture the passions of the times and just seems another historical drama.Too bad this was not another Rome, full of intelligence, accuracy and brilliant acting.",2,Too draggy and too unreal,1214352000,"06 25, 2008",2008,1612,"['portrayed', 'Giametti', 'Adams', 'so', 'depressed', ""'m"", 'amazed', 'Adams', 'was', 'able', 'accomplish', 'anything.And', 'hearing', 'Brits', 'try', 'speak', 'American', 'English', 'very', 'funny', 'One', 'actor', 'pronounces', 'Maryland', 'Mary', 'Land', 'always', 'English', 'shooting', 'Eastern', 'Europe', 'Philly', 'etc', 'always', 'joke', 'Do', 'producers', 'think', 'do', ""n't"", 'notice', 'Takes', 'away', 'reality.It', 'would', 'be', 'nice', 'once', 'HBO', 'used', 'American', 'actors', 'portray', 'American', 'actors', 'film', 'movies', 'where', 'take', 'place.Stephen', 'Dillon', 'playing', 'Jefferson', 'showed', 'such', 'passion', 'have', 'not', 'read', 'book', 'yet', 'have', 'read', 'bios', 'Franklin', 'Jefferson', 'Lafayette', 'characters', 'were', 'real', 'What', 'not', 'show', 'duplicity', 'America', 'early', 'stages', 'Helping', 'England', 'steal', 'Canada', 'French', 'begging', 'France', 'money', 'helping', 'bring', 'down', 'fall', 'Louis', 'Marie', 'support', 'American', 'Revolution', 'drained', 'France', 'bank', 'So', 'much', 'double', 'dealling', 'US', 'was', 'not', 'good', 'paying', 'back', 'supporters.Adams', 'was', 'difficult', 'person', 'be', 'sure', 'series', 'loser', 'depressive', 'doubt', 'was', 'depressive.Abigail', 'had', 'wits', 'brains', 'voluminous', 'correspondence', 'Jefferson', 'years', 'had', 'Patsy', 'stay', 'went', 'join', 'father', 'Jefferson', 'France', 'Adams', 'Jefferson', 'last', 'years', 'wrote', 'extensively', 'became', 'close.This', 'series', 'length', 'not', 'capture', 'passions', 'times', 'just', 'historical', 'drama.Too', 'bad', 'was', 'not', 'Rome', 'full', 'intelligence', 'accuracy', 'brilliant', 'acting']",John Adams

The actors that were chosen for this are incredible and reflect the true spirit of the great heroes upon whose shoulder we stand upon today.Much of what is salvaged and known about John Adams comes from the many correspondences between him and his wife Abigail, played by Laura Linney, who is revealed as his most important and revered confidant and the only person in the entire world who truly knew him and could give him his much needed courage and confidence in the daily face of tyranny, corruption, and deception most of which came from people who called themselves his friends and allies.[NEXT PARAGRAPH MAY CONTAIN POSSIBLE SPOILERS]Both Paul Giamatti and Laura Linney express convincingly the love that John and Abigail Adams had for each other and the true nature of which John had truly needed from his wife in order to face his trials.  While Abigail indeed offered her gentle and loving embrace to an often fragile and uncertain man, her honesty despite the cost of his pride often saved John from many near fatal mistakes from which had he proceeded without her counsel would not have been able to return from.  Thus making it very clear that whether near of far, this important bond despite at times separated by thousands of miles of oceans, was in many ways responsible for keeping our fledgling country together.And John Adams himself as revealed by David McCullough made me identify with a common everyday man who gets dropped into the middle of something that ends up at times to be much bigger than he is, or at least, bigger that he is ready for.  There were so many times that I had to simply stop the Tivo and wait a day to watch it again, that's how well the character was played that I truly identified with this man and the trials he faced, especially when he had to face them alone.Personally, I believe this story as portrayed is one of the best American stories every delivered.  I say this only because I personally believe, from what I took away, that it is truly a story about America and what it means to be an American.

In reality the officer in command, Thomas Preston, recieved a separate trial. The enlisted men were tried separately and 2 of them were convicted.I know that seems like a small unimportant detail, but when you put a big change to history like that I lose trust in the accuracy of everything else. Especially when there is no need to make the change for the story. The movie would have worked just fine if they had said there were two trials and 2 of the defendants were convicted.

I have watched this mini-series twice now and each time I get something new from it and appreciate all over again how lucky we were to have had such a brilliant and determined man as John Adams to fight with all his being to turn this country into a free nation!  Without men like Adams, Jefferson, Washington and even Franklin, who had a tendency to dally somewhat through life in his later years where he could enjoy the fruits of his labors and money, we would not have the Declaration of Independence, Constitution nor the Bill of Rights and possibly would still answer to Great Britain.The series is so well acted that I can't think of anything else that comes close in comparison.  Are there negatives about how Hollywood portrayed some of our Founding Fathers?  You bet!  Could they have done more about many other troubling issues of their times?  Maybe but probably not considering the time they lived in.  Many, including Adams, hated slavery but saw that there wasn't anyway to tackle two wars at the same time which could have torn the country apart doing it.  Did the producers of this miniseries really reflect the true nature, in all its complexity, of Adams?  Not completely.  Adams was a complex and very brilliant man who had his ups and downs in life but, in my opinion, Hollywood spent far too much time focusing on his lows when in fact he was normally an even tempered and likable man.  What about his relationship with his wife?  Abigail Adams was a remarkable woman and believed as strongly as her husband did about the need to be free.  She supported John almost 100% but at the same time spent years of her life managing the family and suffering because of it.  Amazing woman with a personality of steely determination and with an outspoken intelligence.  McCullough said that he could have written a whole book on Abigail Adams alone.  That's a book I would like to read.The costumes are stunning, the backdrops of the towns and homes are without fault, depiction of the era these determined and honorable men lived comes to life making you wish you could have been there to watch our nation being born.  Since we can't go back in time to be there then this is the next best thing.

It is true that not every episode is 5 stars, but even the less impressive episodes in this miniseries are far better than the majority of anything you will see on TV this, or any other year. Where John Adams excels is in the remarkable acting, not just of Giamatti, who is amazing, but particularly of Laura Linney. Linney's natural, understated, performance gives a level of depth and intensity that very few actresses could have conveyed in this role. The supporting performances are almost uniformly excellent, with standout achievement's from David Morse as George Washington, Stephen Dillane as Thomas Jefferson, and the reliable genius of Tom Wilkinson as Ben Franklin. The directing is competent but not inspired. I was rebuffed by the soundtrack's grandiose nature at first, however, the series lived up to insistent tone and delivery by the end.

1109726,A3VQSFORKH8B7O,B000WGWQG8,Steven Hancock,"[46, 54]","Based on the Pulitzer Prize-winning biography by David McCullough, ""John Adams"" takes an in-depth look at the life of the title character, and his role in the first fifty years of the United States. From his time as a Boston lawyer, to his death on the Fiftieth Anniversary of the signing of the Declaration of Independence, the life of John Adams and his wife, Abigail, are told with powerful drama and epic sweep.While the story itself is a bit slow at times (the film could definitely have used some additional music than was there), it is overall very powerful, with dramatic renditions of the events that shaped our nation. Paul Giamatti and Laura Linney both give brilliant performances as John and Abigail Adams, piercing the soul of these dynamic characters. Tom Wilkinson is fascinating as Benjamin Franklin, while Stephen Dillane does a fine job as Thomas Jefferson. But the best supporting role is David Morse, who is surprisingly effective as George Washington, portraying him with great humility, along with occasional bouts of anger, in a performance that is deserving of an Emmy. Sarah Polley, Rufus Sewell and Danny Huston also give strong performances.""John Adams"" is a remarkable miniseries that sheds light on one of the most fascinating characters of the American Revolution. Historians and non-historians alike will find much to enjoy in this epic look at one of the men who played a large role in the birth of our country.Program/DVD Grade: A",5,A POWERFUL LOOK AT THE LIFE OF ONE OF THE FOUNDING FATHERS!,1208649600,"04 20, 2008",2008,1464,"['Based', 'Pulitzer', 'Prize-winning', 'biography', 'David', 'McCullough', 'John', 'Adams', 'in-depth', 'look', 'life', 'title', 'character', 'role', 'first', 'fifty', 'years', 'United', 'States', 'time', 'Boston', 'lawyer', 'death', 'Fiftieth', 'Anniversary', 'signing', 'Declaration', 'Independence', 'life', 'John', 'Adams', 'wife', 'Abigail', 'are', 'told', 'powerful', 'drama', 'epic', 'sweep.While', 'story', 'bit', 'slow', 'times', 'film', 'could', 'definitely', 'have', 'used', 'additional', 'music', 'was', 'overall', 'very', 'powerful', 'dramatic', 'renditions', 'events', 'shaped', 'nation', 'Paul', 'Giamatti', 'Laura', 'Linney', 'give', 'brilliant', 'performances', 'John', 'Abigail', 'Adams', 'piercing', 'soul', 'dynamic', 'characters', 'Tom', 'Wilkinson', 'fascinating', 'Benjamin', 'Franklin', 'Stephen', 'Dillane', 'fine', 'job', 'Thomas', 'Jefferson', 'best', 'supporting', 'role', 'David', 'Morse', 'who', 'surprisingly', 'effective', 'George', 'Washington', 'portraying', 'great', 'humility', 'occasional', 'bouts', 'anger', 'performance', 'deserving', 'Emmy', 'Sarah', 'Polley', 'Rufus', 'Sewell', 'Danny', 'Huston', 'also', 'give', 'strong', 'performances', 'John', 'Adams', 'remarkable', 'miniseries', 'sheds', 'light', 'one', 'most', 'fascinating', 'characters', 'American', 'Revolution', 'Historians', 'non-historians', 'alike', 'will', 'find', 'much', 'enjoy', 'epic', 'look', 'one', 'men', 'who', 'played', 'large', 'role', 'birth', 'country.Program/DVD', 'Grade']",John Adams

Sets, costumes, acting, and script are all top notch.  Puts some blemishes on some of our Founding Fathers, but these revelations seemed factual and not overdone.

1109729,A3QYHR31DF3YN6,B000WGWQG8,Strawgold,"[0, 0]","It was not merely *one*  ""Miracle at Philadelphia,"" it was a series of miracles - from the explosive ""Writs of Assistance"" speech orated by James Otis at Faneuil Hall in Boston that inspired so many of the other Forefathers, to the victory against all odds at Yorktown before the young country to get down to business.  Although the mention of the Pre-Revolution is scant, the very soul of our Nation resonates in this excellent film.  It acknowledges and poignantly presents the personal travail and sacrifices made by these people as they gave their up their lives to the cause, either on the battlefield or in public office, which might be considered the more prolonged and agonizing of the two types of sacrifices.  Finally, the thing that was captured best in this film and which I noted with full understanding,  was the hardest part of all - the bittersweet ""letting go"" and returning, bruised and battered,  to the land they loved - the land worth so much of oneself.  It's that dear and familiar ""something"" that was lost and found again - the ultimate and beautiful ""full circle.""  But -  resonating through that final freedom, is the fact that while retirement is envisioned as being able to enjoy all of what was at leisure, is, in stark reality, that of losing people you love; children, old friends.  A film for the ages is this one.A truly remarkable set of DVD's, based on the book by David McCullough, as well as many other fine historical accountings of our Revolution for Independence,  it brings a new dimension to the biography of John Adams. Kudos to Tom Hanks and his associates for bringing this tribute to us.  The breathtaking introduction visual of the segmented snake that ""joins"" itself and becomes the entire serpent against the billowing new flag is truly moving if you happen to have even a token of emotion for the act of revolution that has given the rest of us so much to build on.  From there, it proceeds to provide us with something the book can't quite manage - the flesh and blood visuals; the living, breathing complexities dwelling in the personalities of the Revolutionists.  The casting was superb.  From the hard-hearted "" do or die"" focus of his cousin Samuel Adams, for whom an end justified the means, to the quiet brilliance of Thomas Jefferson; the controlled discipline behind the intelligence of Abigail; the weakness that threatened all but two of his children and their own spouses as they lived with such a strong father; the imposing, regal figure cut by George Washington; the playful mischievousness of Benjamin Franklin who seemed to consider everyone his personal marionettes.  And Adams' own honest, stubborn integrity that refused to bend or break,  starting with the very unpopular defending of the British Officer and his men accused in the Boston Massacre when feeling was running high against the British.  His worth was evident then; that a free people must have equal protection and adequate defense under the laws and it must be from the beginning in order for it to have meaning.It follows Mr. Adam's family as it endures hardship, selflessness, unimaginable tragedy in the loss of not one but two children, lives through war, politics, small pox outbreaks, and manages to not only survive it all, but be instrumental in the building of a nation from the ground up while it was happening, somehow retaining their emotional sanity.  All travel from the back of a horse or in buggies, or the soggy bottoms of leaking ships, it seems impossible now that they could accomplish so much. Time travel that took months, not hours, letter writing bearing news of vital importance that were always in danger of being lost, intercepted, weeks en route when the messages were needed today.  The scene of Henry Knox spilling his substantial weight all over his saddle as his valiant horse trudged along in the mud behind the ""appropriated"" cannons from Ticonderoga - and aptly named ""Liberty and Independence"" - was worth it's weight in gold.John Adams had a fascination with Thomas Jefferson throughout his life and even into his death, as they died within hours of each other on July 4, 1826, the 50th anniversary of the Independence.  Of Jefferson, he loved, revered, valued his opinions, desired his support in all matters political,felt betrayed by him, broke from him; and in the final ""circle that remains unbroken"", renewed his friendship with him at the behest of their wise mutual acquainatence Benjamin Rush, who was the last link between them both. A competition with Jefferson even in death, Adam's last words were about the man who had been such an influence in his own life as they both gave up their lives in service to their new country.  He was also clearly dependent upon the bond he shared with his wife Abigail, a man who was mighty when he had the support of those he respected and loved, but less sure of his own abilities when standing alone against public opinion.Viewing this film should be inspiration for us all.  In truth, viewing any of these new, beautiful documentaries of the Revolution (there are many good ones) and renewing our appreciation of what we have here, would be timely, in this, an election year preliminary.  A good place to start would be Ken Burns ""Thomas Jefferson"", which is equally well made.",5,""" Till Death Do Us Part.....""",1319587200,"10 26, 2011",2011,5301,"['was', 'not', 'merely', '*one*',

It completely downplays his viewpoints (and those of slave owner Thomas Jefferson, who built Monticello with slave labor) that would send any modern feminist or Marxist critic into a tizzy. Because this miniseries is so worried about offending people, it comes across as disingenuous, plodding, and inconsequential -- the perfect Sunday night soporific for HBO viewers who want to be lulled into complacent sleep before starting their harried work weeks. The relationship between John and Abigail Adams (Laura Linney) is passionless and arid, as if their marriage rested solely on chats about democratic ideals and legal principles.

The tasking of taking David McCullogh's prize winning book of the same name into a spectacular mini-series can be overwelming. Of course, there will be things left out but I can't recommend it enough because it's so addictive. To begin with, Paul Giamati (Sideways star) transforms himself into John Adams, America's second President and first Vice PResident and America's first ambassador to Great Britain after the American REvolution. He is madly in love with his wife, Abigail, played remarkably by Oscar Nominee Laura Linney. Adams is not without his faults especially towards his three children, JOhn Quincy Adams who is his favorite, his only daughter Nellie (played by Sarah Polley) who married Colonel William Smith who thinks he can use the Adams name, Charles Adams as the disappointment who makes a fool of himself and the family name but suffers the most and marries his brother-in-law's sister, Sally Smith (played by Mamie Gummer who is Meryl Streep's daughter). and the other son whose name escapes me at the moment.In other parts of the film, David Morse (St. Elsewhere) becomes George Washington and so identical to the man on our dollar bills that it's uncanny and strange all at once. Tom Wilkinson OBE plays Ben Franklin who is both genius and decadent in Paris. I don't remember the actor who plays Thomas Jefferson but he is memorable.The mini-series is high quality and first rate that it would have swept the Academy Awards as a film but it was nominated for 23 Emmys, Giamati won Best Actor, Linney won Bet Actress, Wilkinson won Best Supporting Actor as Franklin but I would have wished there was a tie between him and Morse. It also won for Best Writing but lost for directing to a two hour film which was just wrong because this mini-series is perhaps the best things to watch in a long time.I think this DVD should be in ever history classroom in America.

Author Joseph Ellis, is the forward to his book Founding Brothers, says that, unlike the other leading players, Adams (though as aware as the others that he was playing an important role in American history) could not 'hold the pose.' He could not put aside what made him human so that he might be better regarded by history.That's what you see in this series: Adams, warts and all. A brilliant, yet flawed, man. A truly great, principled man.His extraordinary Abigail - wife and best friend - is shown in all her glory. In another time, she would have made a successful leader herself - perhaps better than John. In the 21st century, she might have made us proud as the first female US president. Yet we see some of what made her human, too.Many have written that this story does not follow David McCullough's outstanding book very well, especially in the early years. Be that as it may, it follows closely enough to satisfy the historian in me.The 'son Charles as out-of control alcoholic' subplot of later programs was perhaps highlighted because it makes one wonder how difficult it must be to be the son of such a man. I have often wondered how John Quincy turned out to be the public servant he was while Charles' path was so much more difficult. John Quincy certainly had his flaws - how could any son of Abigail Adams grow up not to respect women and treat his wife so shabily? - but of course lived a long, generally much more worthy of praise life than all of his brothers.Only one thing: every time the actors went by the Adams houses during the Revolutionary War, they were going in the wrong direction!

1109760,A3Q5IRZ3ZJV4P3,B000WGWQG8,"Valueminded ""leadpedal2""","[6, 8]","The series starts out nicely but quickly turns bland, mostly due to dreadful choices in scripting.  The director covers major events in history in banal conversations between characters, instead of actual film scenes.  For example, the major battles of the war are glossed over, and the famous Boston tea party is covered in a five minute discussion between John Adams and his brother Sam Adams.  This is the major flaw with this series.  The most profound example is how the film handled the American victory in the War of Independence: at the very climax of the war, when America wins its independence, all we see is John Adams in his sick bed, receiving news of the event.  How pathetic.  You'd think they could be a little more creative than that.  I mean, if JFK had a cold during the first moon landing, do you think his film biography would show him sick in bed reading the news, or would it still show the Apollo moon landing?Paul Giamatti plays a wonderful John Adams.  He is very convincing.  And the early scenes between him and his wife, portrayed by Laura Linney, are quite touching.  Their early years together are fascinating.  But as the time passes, I found myself less and less interested in John Adams and more interested in the surrounding events which were not portrayed.  I found myself wondering what was the point?The series has some wonderful sets, like the recreation of Boston harbor filled with British warships, and the royal court in France.  Some of the scenes of John Adams in France are startling, especially the royal dinner party.  All the french are terrible snobs and yet they look completely ridiculous in their wigs and heavy, heavy make-up (the men were the worst).Unfortunately, it is all wasted.  The movie has many opportunities to excel, but falls far short. The best example perhaps is Adams' vice-presidency.  The film briefly talks about a conspiracy to keep him from becoming president, and offers some vague hints about collusion between Washington and Hamilton to control the government.  Yet this shocking revelation is glossed over in favor of other scenes where Adams is simply treated by his fellows with a lack of respect.  An entire episode should have been spent just on this early political intrigue.",2,Missing in Action,1230854400,"01 2, 2009",2009,2258,"['series', 'out', 'nicely', 'quickly', 'bland', 'mostly', 'due', 'dreadful', 'choices', 'scripting', 'director', 'major', 'events', 'history', 'banal', 'conversations', 'characters', 'instead', 'actual', 'film', 'scenes', 'example', 'major', 'battles', 'war', 'are', 'glossed', 'famous', 'Boston', 'tea', 'party', 'covered', 'five', 'minute', 'discussion', 'John', 'Adams', 'brother', 'Sam', 'Adams', 'major', 'flaw', 'series', 'most', 'profound', 'example', 'how', 'film', 'handled', 'American', 'victory', 'War', 'Independence', 'very', 'climax', 'war', 'when', 'America', 'independence', 'see', 'John', 'Adams', 'sick', 'bed', 'receiving', 'news', 'event', 'How', 'pathetic', ""'d"", 'think', 'could', 'be', 'little', 'more', 'creative', 'mean', 'JFK', 'had', 'cold', 'first', 'moon', 'landing', 'do', 'think', 'film', 'biography', 'would', 'show', 'sick', 'bed', 'reading', 'news', 'would', 'still', 'show', 'Apollo', 'moon', 'landing', 'Paul', 'Giamatti', 'wonderful', 'John', 'Adams', 'very', 'convincing', 'early', 'scenes', 'wife', 'portrayed', 'Laura', 'Linney', 'are', 'quite', 'touching', 'early', 'years', 'together', 'are', 'fascinating', 'time', 'found', 'less', 'less', 'interested', 'John', 'Adams', 'more', 'interested', 'surrounding', 'events', 'were', 'not', 'portrayed', 'found', 'wondering', 'what', 'was', 'point', 'series', 'wonderful', 'sets', 'recreation', 'Boston', 'harbor', 'filled', 'British', 'warships', 'royal', 'court', 'France', 'scenes', 'John', 'Adams', 'France', 'are', 'startling', 'especially', 'royal', 'dinner', 'party', 'french', 'are', 'terrible', 'snobs', 'yet', 'look', 'completely', 'ridiculous', 'wigs', 'heavy', 'heavy', 'make-up', 'men', 'were', 'worst', '.Unfortunately', 'wasted', 'movie', 'many', 'opportunities', 'excel', 'far', 'short', 'best', 'example', 'perhaps', 'Adams', 'vice-presidency', 'film', 'briefly', 'talks', 'conspiracy', 'keep', 'becoming', 'president', 'vague', 'hints', 'collusion', 'Washington', 'Hamilton', 'control', 'government', 'shocking', 'revelation', 'glossed', 'favor', 'other', 'scenes', 'where', 'Adams', 'simply', 'treated', 'fellows', 'lack', 'respect', 'entire', 'episode', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'spent', 'just', 'early', 'political', 'intrigue']",John Adams

A drama is exactly that--not history nor does it pretend to be. As drama ""John Adams"" is gripping giving us insight and allowing us to understand our founding fathers as complex human beings.The cast does an outstanding job of humanizing these people from history making it possible to relate to their actions whether they be honorable or petty.Although based on David McCullough bestselling biography, the producers and writer Kirk Ellis used other sources in addition to the biography by McCullough to give us a broader view of the time and the drama that surrounded Adams and the birth of our country.The Blu-ray looks positively stunning with a sharp, detailed transfer that has more depth than I saw when I rented the regular DVD. Dark scenes in particular benefit from the high definition format with richer and more accurate detail. The audio sounds terrific throughout with a nice surround lossless mix.For those that are concerned with 100% historical accuracy, I'd suggest reading McCullough's book and other information on Adams (because as good as McCullough's book IS he also shows a certain bias towards his subject as he interprets Adams thoughts and actions based on his writings and the writings of others)but as far as a historical drama, ""John Adams"" is hard to beat.

Though those events now take on an air of legend, viewers will quickly take pleasure in seeing the events not portrayed as overly epic (unless they actually were!) but as the real-life struggles of some pioneer thinkers.However, what continues to stick in my mind after viewing the entire series is how ""real"" the entire experience seemed.  From the macro level (like the general living conditions and attitudes towards women/slavery) to the micro level (the crude nature of medicine and the sound of flies that can be heard buzzing in almost every scene), it felt as if I really had been transported to that time period.Also not to be overlooked is the incredible acting throughout the series.  Paul Giammatti (Adams) is one of the most underrated character actors of the modern day, and yet he is matched word for word by Laura Linney (Abigail Adams).  The actors portraying such characters as Thomas Jefferson, Benjamin Franklin, and George Washington are even able to bring forth the traits of the real-life luminaries they are portraying.Thus, I would recommend this seven-part miniseries to pretty much any viewer who has any interest in historical topics whatsoever.  Experts on the period will enjoy the realism of the series, while more casual viewers will just be transported away to a life that, while difficult, produced men and women that turned the U.S. into a nation to be reckoned with.",5,Gritty Realism And Incredible Acting Make This Miniseries A Rousing Success,1258934400,"11 23, 2009",2009,1896,"['most', 'people', 'may', 'be', 'drawn', 'HBO', 'miniseries', 'look', 'founding', 'fathers', 'events', 'nation', 'early', 'years', 'existence', 'would', 'like', 'add', 'reason', 'well', 'two', 'actually', 'gritty', 'realism', 'period', 'portrayed', 'incredible', 'acting', 'really', 'characters', 'life.Now', 'do', ""n't"", 'get', 'wrong', 'series', 'indeed', 'fascinating', 'look', 'formative', 'years', 'United', 'States', 'America', 'prism', 'John', 'Adams', 'existence', 'events', 'now', 'take', 'air', 'legend', 'viewers', 'will', 'quickly', 'take', 'pleasure', 'seeing', 'events', 'not', 'portrayed', 'overly', 'epic', 'actually', 'were', 'real-life', 'struggles', 'pioneer', 'thinkers.However', 'what', 'stick', 'mind', 'viewing', 'entire', 'series', 'how', 'real', 'entire', 'experience', 'seemed', 'macro', 'level', 'general', 'living', 'conditions', 'attitudes', 'towards', 'women/slavery', 'micro', 'level', 'crude', 'nature', 'medicine', 'sound', 'flies', 'can', 'be', 'heard', 'buzzing', 'almost', 'scene', 'felt', 'really', 'had', 'been', 'transported', 'time', 'not', 'be', 'overlooked', 'incredible', 'acting', 'series', 'Paul', 'Giammatti', 'Adams', 'one', 'most', 'underrated', 'character', 'actors', 'modern', 'day', 'yet', 'matched', 'word', 'word', 'Laura', 'Linney', 'Abigail', 'Adams', 'actors', 'portraying', 'such', 'characters', 'Thomas', 'Jefferson', 'Benjamin', 'Franklin', 'George', 'Washington', 'are', 'even', 'able', 'bring', 'forth', 'traits', 'real-life', 'luminaries', 'are', 'portraying.Thus', 'would', 'recommend', 'seven-part', 'miniseries', 'pretty', 'much', 'viewer', 'who', 'interest', 'historical', 'topics', 'whatsoever', 'Experts', 'period', 'will', 'enjoy', 'realism', 'series', 'more', 'casual', 'viewers', 'will', 'just', 'be', 'transported', 'away', 'life', 'difficult', 'produced', 'men', 'women', 'turned', 'U.S.', 'nation', 'be', 'reckoned']",John Adams
