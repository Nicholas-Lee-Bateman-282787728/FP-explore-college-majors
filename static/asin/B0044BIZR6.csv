Never mind the fact that it is locked by a handful of padlocks!  Once open Evil starts slowly seeping out of it.The Acting was really good, and they didn't cut corners on effects.  If the fact that the main characters make choices that are clearly off bothers you then there is that issue!  This happens a lot in the first half of the film.  But the characters are so loveable you can overlook the standard... ""What was that creepy noise coming from the basement... let's go and see"" kinda stuff.They even throw in some dream/nightmare and Freddy Kruger kinda stuff for good measure!  And the Effects are great!  All in all it is a good movie with a so so storyline and nice overall effect.  The humor worked in is not easy to pull off, and they did this nicely!Check it out for a fun filled night of gotcha horror!  OH!!!  And they have one of the best CREEPY CLOWN scenes EVER!!!

1384987,A1NV8HZTGKIPXQ,B0044BIZR6,"Barry ""Barrybgb""","[2, 3]","I have been wanting to see this movie for the longest time. It's a shame that it sat on the shelf for as long as it did before finally getting a release. Hopefully, we will never have to wait too long for Joe Dante to give us another film.""The Hole"" is about a family who move into a new house in a nice suburban neighborhood. Single mother and two sons. As the kids adjust to their new surroundings, and oldest brother Dane keeps his eye on the cute girl next door, they discover a weird hole that seemingly goes nowhere in their basement. As soon as they open it, weird things begin to happen. The hole reads them and soon these three's deepest fears begin to come to life and they must figure out a way to stop it once and for all.It's been way too long since Joe Dante has blessed us with a movie. While ""The Hole"" may not win any major awards, it is a thoroughly entertaining and interesting film that finds Dante in familiar territory. In the 80s, Dante and other filmmakers were terrific at bringing scares and spooks to family friendly kid entertainment that everyone of all ages could enjoy. That's what we get here. ""The Hole"" is old school scares wrapped up in a new movie. It may not be crazily original, but it works, and with Dante's knowing eye behind the camera, you can't take your eyes off it. It's mostly a light affair, but it does have some striking images and scenes peppered thoughtout, but it does take somewhat of a dark turn towards the end when Dane's fear is realized. The cast is adequate, if nothing spectacular. Dante regulars Dick Miller (in a no dialogue cameo) and Bruce Dern also appear. What, no Robert Picardo? Teri Polo, as the mother, is mostly wasted in the typical working mom role who doesn't know what's going on.""The Hole"" may seem like a longer, bigger budgeted episode of The Hub network's ""The Haunting Hour"", but there is enough here to warrant a watch for anybody. I grew up on the stuff Dante and others made in the 80s, so this was maybe more to me than it will be for others, because it's a kind of movie that they used to make that, sadly, don't make too much of anymore. No, ""The Hole"" isn't anything fantastic, but it's an easily watchable, entertaining movie from a talented guy who's made a number of fun movies (""Gremlins"", ""The Burbs"", ""The Howling"", ""Innerspace"", ""Piranha"", and the criminally underrated ""Matinee""). It's a decent movie to show to the little ones for a light scare, but the parents may find it watchable themselves if they grew up at the time Dante and others were kings.",3,"Joe Dante's ""Hole"" Doesn't Stink",1350172800,"10 14, 2012",2012,2548,"['have', 'been', 'wanting', 'see', 'movie', 'longest', 'time', 'shame', 'sat', 'shelf', 'as', 'long', 'did', 'finally', 'getting', 'release', 'Hopefully', 'will', 'never', 'have', 'wait', 'too', 'long', 'Joe', 'Dante', 'give', 'film', 'Hole', 'family', 'who', 'move', 'new', 'house', 'nice', 'suburban', 'neighborhood', 'Single', 'mother', 'two', 'sons', 'kids', 'adjust', 'new', 'surroundings', 'oldest', 'brother', 'Dane', 'eye', 'cute', 'girl', 'next', 'door', 'discover', 'weird', 'hole', 'seemingly', 'nowhere', 'basement', 'As', 'soon', 'open', 'weird', 'things', 'begin', 'happen', 'hole', 'soon', 'three', 'deepest', 'fears', 'begin', 'come', 'life', 'must', 'figure', 'out', 'way', 'stop', 'once', 'all.It', 'been', 'way', 'too', 'long', 'Joe', 'Dante', 'blessed', 'movie', 'Hole', 'may', 'not', 'win', 'major', 'awards', 'thoroughly', 'entertaining', 'interesting', 'film', 'Dante', 'familiar', 'territory', '80s', 'Dante', 'other', 'filmmakers', 'were', 'terrific', 'bringing', 'scares', 'spooks', 'family', 'friendly', 'kid', 'entertainment', 'everyone', 'ages', 'could', 'enjoy', 'what', 'get', 'here', 'Hole', 'old', 'school', 'scares', 'wrapped', 'up', 'new', 'movie', 'may', 'not', 'be', 'crazily', 'original', 'Dante', 'knowing', 'eye', 'camera', 'ca', ""n't"", 'take', 'eyes', 'mostly', 'light', 'affair', 'have', 'striking', 'images', 'scenes', 'peppered', 'thoughtout', 'take', 'somewhat', 'dark', 'turn', 'end', 'when', 'Dane', 'fear', 'realized', 'cast', 'adequate', 'nothing', 'spectacular', 'Dante', 'Dick', 'Miller', 'dialogue', 'cameo', 'Bruce', 'Dern', 'also', 'appear', 'What', 'Robert', 'Picardo', 'Teri', 'Polo', 'mother', 'mostly', 'wasted', 'typical', 'working', 'mom', 'role', 'who', ""n't"", 'know', 'what', 'going', 'Hole', 'may', 'seem', 'longer', 'bigger', 'budgeted', 'episode', 'Hub', 'network', 'Haunting', 'Hour', 'enough', 'here', 'warrant', 'watch', 'anybody', 'grew', 'up', 'stuff', 'Dante', 'others', 'made', '80s', 'so', 'was', 'maybe', 'more', 'will', 'be', 'others', 'kind', 'movie', 'used', 'make', 'sadly', 'do', ""n't"", 'make', 'too', 'much', 'anymore', 'No', 'Hole', ""n't"", 'anything', 'fantastic', 'easily', 'watchable', 'entertaining', 'movie', 'talented', 'guy', 'who', 'made', 'number', 'fun', 'movies', 'Gremlins', 'Burbs', 'Howling', 'Innerspace', 'Piranha', 'criminally', 'underrated', 'Matinee', 'decent', 'movie', 'show', 'little', 'ones', 'light', 'scare', 'parents', 'may', 'find', 'watchable', 'grew', 'up', 'time', 'Dante', 'others', 'were', 'kings']",The hole  2D metalbox  2D metalbox anglais

1384989,A301C4SBHWTJV5,B0044BIZR6,Brian P. Nestor,"[4, 4]","Joe Dante has always had a touch with horror, making it funny as well as scary, and he has always had a way with young people in his movies as well, treating them as adults instead of idiots.  Both of the director's skills are on ample display in a horror movie that is aimed at the 8 to 16 year old set.  The movie itself remains intelligent and even challenging while being age appropriate.  That, my friends, is a rarity today.'The Hole' is as much about a dysfunctional family struggling through hard times and facing new challenges as it is about horror.  Gore hounds will be disappointed with the plot, but there is plenty of creepiness, suspense, and shocks to satisfy all but the most jaded.  Special notice must be given to Bruce Dern's cameo in the movie, which absolutely warmed my heart.So if you are in the market for a decent scary movie that isn't rated R, 'The Hole' is perfect.

The Hole, however, is not.Brothers Dane and Lucus and their mother recently move into a new town.  While exploring their new home, they find a gaping hole under a rug that has been padlocked shut.  Of course they decide to open it and all hell breaks loose.  Strange things begin to happen and it's only until they face their greatest fear can they triumph.While its nice to see Joe Dante (Gremlins, The Howling) back in action, this movie is proof that, like all the great directors of yesteryear, he's ran out of the magic he once had.  The movie itself feels like it was made for one of ABC Family's 13 Days of Halloween block lineup.  It tries to capture the nostalgia of past 80s classics as Gremlins and The Gate but fails miserably.  The main cast is small with the only Halley Bennett (The Haunting of Molly Hartley, College) playing the hot girl next door Julie as the only face I recognized.  The two actors playing Dane and Lucus are decent enough but I wouldn't recommend them to any one.  Teri Polo (Meet the Parents, ""I'm With Her"") and Bruce Dern (Blue Velvet, The Glass House) turn in sleepy performance with Polo appearing to be really regretting signing on to this mess.  The cheap CGI-effects are obvious from the get-go as well as the pancake made up ghost of a little girl from Julie's past.  This little girl is just awful and should've been cut out of the movie all together.  Avoid it only unless you're babysitting your pesky little brother and know that he's scared of clown dolls.

It is utterly unoriginal in both story and execution. Movies do not have to be original insofar as plot - the very concept of ""genre"" underscores this fact. But formulaic or derivative movies are especially beholden to execute their predictable plots and two-dimensional characters with some kind of flourish, and The Hole fails on this account.

The premise isn't too complicated:  Two brothers and their single mother move into a house with a mysterious hole located in the basement.  As the two brothers befriend the girl next door, the trio soon begin to find themselves confronted by supernatural events related to the presence of the hole.What transpires is a simple tale with large mythical overtones that help make it  accessible to a diverse audience.  The horror ""scenarios"" aren't incredibly novel or original per se; but Dante still manages to make them chilling and unique in a way many contemporary horror films haven't.  In fact, there is a very compelling reason WHY they seem to have been derived from other horror movies -- but to explain that reason would be to divulge a major reveal of the story.  Let's just say that Dante is one who, in his philosophy of storytelling in general, and horror movies in particular, has espoused the belief that stories are receptacles of universal emotions; and that horror films in particular are most successful when they capitalize on universal fears.

As they get comfortable, Dane and Lucas, along with their neighbor, Julie, find a mysterious hole in the basement; a hole that seems to have no barriers and no purpose. But, soon these young kids begin to witness their greatest fears come to life. The Hole is a truly enjoyable horror film that blends tension and jump-scares, while delivering an old-school horror vibe.The Hole's story is interesting, captivating, and thoroughly entertaining, although it does have some typical horror cliches. There are plenty of scares in this film that do not rely on ridiculous gore or extremely loud music, at least not at all times. If you grew up watching the old-school horror films, you'll feel right at home. There is even a killer clown doll that was actually very creepy. The story has a lot of foreshadowing, so you'll probably be able to predict the ending; that's not too bad since the ending was fulfilling and engaging. The acting was decent throughout the film, but there are a couple of lines of dialogue and conversations that felt forced/unnatural. Also, the special effects and make-up were great most of the time, but it does suffer from poor effects occasionally. The music complimented the tone of the film, and the cinematography matched the film's vibe.Overall, I really enjoyed The Hole. It's a great horror film that packs plenty of suspense and some decent jump-scares; it's also a horror film that the whole family can watch since the violence and disturbing imagery is limited. The type of film I would've loved as a child, and still love today. As of 12/1/12, this film is available on Netflix Streaming, and I recommend renting/streaming or purchasing if you're a fan of the genre.The Hole has some violence and blood, no sex or nudity.",4,"....a truly enjoyable horror film that blends tension and jump-scares, while delivering an old-school horror vibe...",1354320000,"12 1, 2012",2012,1866,"['Hole', 'small', 'family', 'three', 'two', 'brothers', 'mother', 'move', 'new', 'neighborhood', 'get', 'comfortable', 'Dane', 'Lucas', 'neighbor', 'Julie', 'find', 'mysterious', 'hole', 'basement', 'hole', 'have', 'barriers', 'purpose', 'soon', 'young', 'kids', 'begin', 'witness', 'greatest', 'fears', 'come', 'life', 'Hole', 'truly', 'enjoyable', 'horror', 'film', 'tension', 'jump-scares', 'delivering', 'old-school', 'horror', 'vibe.The', 'Hole', 'story', 'interesting', 'captivating', 'thoroughly', 'entertaining', 'have', 'typical', 'horror', 'cliches', 'are', 'plenty', 'scares', 'film', 'do', 'not', 'rely', 'ridiculous', 'gore', 'extremely', 'loud', 'music', 'least', 'not', 'times', 'grew', 'up', 'watching', 'old-school', 'horror', 'films', ""'ll"", 'feel', 'right', 'home', 'even', 'killer', 'clown', 'doll', 'was', 'actually', 'very', 'creepy', 'story', 'lot', 'foreshadowing', ""'ll"", 'probably', 'be', 'able', 'predict', 'ending', 'not', 'too', 'bad', 'ending', 'was', 'fulfilling', 'engaging', 'acting', 'was', 'decent', 'film', 'are', 'couple', 'lines', 'dialogue', 'conversations', 'felt', 'forced/unnatural', 'Also', 'special', 'effects', 'make-up', 'were', 'great', 'most', 'time', 'suffer', 'poor', 'effects', 'occasionally', 'music', 'complimented', 'tone', 'film', 'cinematography', 'matched', 'film', 'vibe.Overall', 'really', 'enjoyed', 'Hole', 'great', 'horror', 'film', 'plenty', 'suspense', 'decent', 'jump-scares', 'also', 'horror', 'film', 'whole', 'family', 'can', 'watch', 'violence', 'disturbing', 'imagery', 'limited', 'type', 'film', 'would', ""'ve"", 'loved', 'child', 'still', 'love', 'today', '12/1/12', 'film', 'available', 'Netflix', 'Streaming', 'recommend', 'renting/streaming', 'purchasing', ""'re"", 'fan', 'genre.The', 'Hole', 'violence', 'blood', 'sex', 'nudity']",The hole  2D metalbox  2D metalbox anglais

They have a nice looking neighbor and discover that there is a hole in their basement that seems to lead to nowhere.3. Through a series of minor plot developments (including a visit to a Resident Nutjob) and a lot of suspense that is drug on for a LONG TIME, we find out that this hole is some type of Ancient Evil that feeds on the fear of the people who look into it.4. Each character is forced in the movie to face his or her fear as the price of putting the demons to rest. (So, one character is afraid of clowns and must face his fear. Another is afraid of his absent father. And still a third has a bad childhood memory that has to be faced down.)5. Of course, three of the four main characters face their fears, and the hole closes. But then the 4th character states here fear and in Predictable Fashion, we get a hint that it is going to happen again. (I can't imagine anyone funding a sequel to this.)It was clear that this was a low budget film, but it was tastefully done. They also succeeded in making the special effects look pretty decent and not so cheesy. I guess it's a testament to the improvements that have allowed believable special effects to be made for a low price. There was also very little blood and gore, and there was thought to the plot.

Polo as Susan Thompson,and Nathan Gamble as Lucas Thompson.You've heard of diet Pepsi?Well this is diet horror.A pretty lame and failed attempt at creating a scary movie.It had a low budget,but budgets have never meant bad because they are low.It is always the creative team behind its making that is responsible for the end product,and if it works it works,if it doesn't,then you get something like this.Two brothers and their mother move into a new neighbourhood.The older brother catches a look at the girl next door and the two will eventually get cozy.In the meantime however while rummaging through the basement they discover a wooden door on the floor,secured with six different locks.Their curiosity gets the best of them and they find an old paint can containing the keys for each lock.They open it and inky blackness stares back at them.They throw down various objects but none seem to reach bottom.They soon return upstairs and continue their lives.However something(s)have been released.The first is a clown doll that suddenly appears on the bed of the little brother and disappears.As the older one gets to know the girl next door better,they invite her down and she witnesses the hole for herself.In a restaurant washroom the next day the lights suddenly go out and a young girl with one shoe saunters towards her from a stall.Then the lights come on and some friends walk in.The little girl having of course disappeared.The next day the little girl comes into the brothers house while all three are there.They ultimately watch as she returns to the hole and disappears into its blackness.The group decide to go visit the previous owner of the house Creepy Carl.He resides in an old abandoned theme park.He lives in one of the buildings underground fixing lights.When he learns of them opening the door he freaks.He shouts of death and destruction and they of course high tail it out.Things start getting more intense as the clown doll actually attacks the younger brother.Then a policeman comes by looking for one of two girls in a picture he hands the younger brother.The little girl he seeks is the girl who has been following the older brothers g/f.When he turns around the back of his head is exposing his brain.He too wanders down stairs and disappears into the hole.The older brother somewhere along the line decides each of these manifestations so far has to do with one's fears coming to life.His younger brothers fear of clowns,his g/f's young girl apparition,it turns out,is an old friend that got killed on a roller coaster ride that was stuck.The g/f was too scared to help and the young girl fell to her death.The older brother says he fears nothing but along comes an apparition of his father who served time in prison.He takes the younger brother down the hole and the older one goes after the both of them.Holding onto a rope he lands into a surreal landscape.He spies his brother and both end up hiding in what would have been the same closet he used to hide in when his father went on tears in his childhood.He finally stands up to his father,saves his little brother and returns to the basement.The film ends as their mother comes downstairs and asks what it is they're doing.All three finally reveal the hole to her.She lifts up the lid and all there is now are exposed pipes.The curse is lifted.I found lead Massoglia's acting,left a LOT to be desired.He should have been stronger;better emoting and vocalization.He is still young,so he has lots of time to hone his acting chops as the years go by.The rest of the cast I had no problems with.It was nice to see screen vet Dern as Crazy Carl.We had seen the clown doll move by suggestion.That is you would see the clown on the bed one moment,and the next it would be gone.But when the clown actually started to talk and move in front of our eyes,well I'm sorry it just wasn't believable enough.Chucky this thing wasn't,and HE was believable.The directing here was pedestrian and the script lame stuff we've seen a hundred times over and done better elsewhere.More than 3/4 the way through this movie,the older brother finally decides that it is their fears coming to life.I just cannot figure out what the catalyst was for him finally deciding,after all that had gone on previous,at that moment,that this was the answer.Technically speaking the film is in its w/s a/r of 1:85:1 and is clear and crisp.Extras include stills and three featurettes.All in all a disappointing and lame attempt at a horror movie.Its low budget shows,unfortunately.They seemingly spent most of their dough on getting Bruce Dern on board,and had little left over for anything else.",2,"Scary.....eh,kids?",1360281600,"02 8, 2013",2013,4783,"['Hole', 'released', 'Sept/09', 'stars',

1385012,A2EDZH51XHFA9B,B0044BIZR6,"Robert Beveridge ""xterminal""","[0, 0]","The Hole (Joe Dante, 2009)If you're going to make an homage to the young-adult horror films of the eighties, who better to do it than one of the original directors? Joe Dante, whose resume in the horror world was built first on cheap exploitation flicks (Piranha) and then on blockbuster teen horror (Gremlins), returns to the world he helped build, and a welcome return it is indeed. The Hole could easily have been made in 1989 rather than 2009, and I say this with a great deal of affection. This is a fun, fun movie, though perhaps Dante cleaved a little too closely to the formula (more on this later).Plot: A city-bred family--mom (Beyond Borders' Teri Polo) and her two sons, older Dane (The Vampire's Assistant's Chris Massoglia) and younger Lucas (The Dark Knight's Nathan Gamble)--move to a little piece of suburbia. While the kids are messing around in the basement, they discover a many-padlocked trapdoor, and when they open it (as, of course, they must), they discover that there seems to be a bottomless pit in their house. With the assistance of their next-door neighbor, beautiful Julie (The Haunting of Molly Hartley's Haley Bennett), they track down the house's former owner, known only as Creepy Carl (Tattoo's Brice Dern), and find out that the hole is a portal to a dimension that forces people to face their deepest fears. While Dane professes to not be scared of anything, both Lucas and Julie soon find themselves haunted...Everything I love about this movie I summed up in the first paragraph--it feels like those safe, easy teen ""horror"" movies my entire generation grew up on. We loved Gremlins just as much as we loved Phantasm (or, for that matter, Piranha), and that was okay; the world of PG horror films in the eighties was vastly different than it is today, when a PG-13 rating on a horror film dooms it to mediocrity before it's even released. Hell, this is the first PG-13 horror film in the last twenty years I remember actually liking.SPOILER ALERT: the following paragraph can be construed to contain a major spoiler. If you haven't seen the movie and are intending to, stop reading now.The one thing about those YA-horror blockbusters that did always grate on me, though, was that very safety. You knew going in that everything was going to be okay; they were the celluloid equivalent of romance novels. The heroine was always going to wind up with the guy who was best for her by the last page of the novel, and they would live happily ever after. And, well, if you want to consider it a spoiler alert you can: Dante went right along with the formula. Didn't deviate from it one iota. You would think that would kick the nostalgia bells into high gear, but given the movie's lukewarm reception (as I write this, its IMDB rating is 5.8, audience rating is 48% on RT, though critical reception was much better [78%]), that doesn't seem to be the case. It would have been great to see Dante suddenly turn on his heel and break new ground like he did in the early eighties... unfortunately, though, no dice, and in my estimation, the movie suffers for it--and I don't seem to be alone in that. Still, I did find it an enjoyable experience. As with a few other movies I've seen recently, you may need to be of a certain age to get the most out of this flick, but it's a fun ride if you grew up on Joe Dante movies in the eighties. ***",3,"Twenty years later, Joe Dante can still make a darn good eighties teen horror movie.",1364428800,"03 28, 2013",2013,3370,"['Hole', 'Joe', 'Dante', '2009', ""'re"", 'going', 'make', 'homage', 'young-adult', 'horror', 'films', 'eighties', 'who', 'better', 'do', 'one', 'original', 'directors', 'Joe', 'Dante', 'resume', 'horror', 'world', 'was', 'built', 'first', 'cheap', 'exploitation', 'flicks', 'Piranha', 'then', 'blockbuster', 'teen', 'horror', 'Gremlins', 'world', 'helped', 'build', 'welcome', 'return', 'indeed', 'Hole', 'could', 'easily', 'have', 'been', 'made', '1989', 'rather', '2009', 'say', 'great', 'deal', 'affection', 'fun', 'fun', 'movie', 'perhaps', 'Dante', 'cleaved', 'little', 'too', 'closely', 'formula', 'more', 'later', '.Plot', 'city-bred', 'family', 'mom', 'Beyond', 'Borders', 'Teri', 'Polo', 'two', 'sons', 'older', 'Dane', 'Vampire', 'Assistant', 'Chris', 'Massoglia', 'younger', 'Lucas', 'Dark', 'Knight', 'Nathan', 'Gamble', 'move', 'little', 'piece', 'suburbia', 'kids', 'are', 'messing', 'basement', 'discover', 'many-padlocked', 'trapdoor', 'when', 'open', 'course', 'must', 'discover', 'be', 'bottomless', 'pit', 'house', 'assistance', 'next-door', 'neighbor', 'beautiful', 'Julie', 'Haunting', 'Molly', 'Hartley', 'Haley', 'Bennett', 'track', 'down', 'house', 'former', 'owner', 'known', 'only', 'Creepy', 'Carl', 'Tattoo', 'Brice', 'Dern', 'find', 'out', 'hole', 'portal', 'dimension', 'people', 'face', 'deepest', 'fears', 'Dane', 'professes', 'not', 'be', 'scared', 'anything', 'Lucas', 'Julie', 'soon', 'find', 'haunted', 'Everything', 'love', 'movie', 'summed', 'up', 'first', 'paragraph', 'safe', 'easy', 'teen', 'horror', 'movies', 'entire', 'generation', 'grew', 'up', 'loved', 'Gremlins', 'just', 'as', 'much', 'loved', 'Phantasm', 'matter', 'Piranha', 'was', 'okay', 'world', 'PG', 'horror', 'films', 'eighties', 'was', 'vastly', 'different', 'today', 'when', 'PG-13', 'rating', 'horror', 'film', 'dooms', 'mediocrity', 'even', 'released', 'Hell', 'first', 'PG-13', 'horror', 'film', 'last', 'twenty', 'years', 'remember', 'actually', 'liking.SPOILER', 'ALERT', 'following', 'paragraph', 'can', 'be', 'construed', 'contain', 'major', 'spoiler', 'have', ""n't"", 'seen', 'movie', 'are', 'intending', 'stop', 'reading', 'one', 'thing', 'YA-horror', 'blockbusters', 'did', 'always', 'grate', 'though', 'was', 'very', 'safety', 'knew', 'going', 'everything', 'was', 'going', 'be', 'okay', 'were', 'celluloid', 'equivalent', 'romance', 'novels', 'heroine', 'was', 'always', 'going', 'wind', 'up', 'guy', 'who', 'was', 'best', 'last', 'page', 'novel', 'would', 'live', 'happily', 'ever', 'well', 'want', 'consider', 'spoiler', 'can', 'Dante', 'went', 'right', 'formula', 'Did', ""n't"", 'deviate', 'one', 'iota', 'would', 'think', 'would', 'kick', 'nostalgia', 'high', 'gear', 'given', 'movie', 'lukewarm', 'reception', 'write', 'IMDB', 'rating', '5.8', 'audience', 'rating', '48', '%', 'RT', 'though', 'critical', 'reception', 'was', 'much', 'better', '[', '78', '%', ']', ""n't"", 'seem', 'be', 'case', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'great', 'see', 'Dante', 'suddenly', 'turn', 'heel', 'break', 'new', 'ground', 'did', 'early', 'eighties', 'unfortunately', 'dice', 'estimation', 'movie', 'suffers', 'do', ""n't"", 'seem', 'be', 'alone', 'Still', 'did', 'find', 'enjoyable', 'experience', 'few', 'other', 'movies', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'recently', 'may', 'need', 'be', 'certain', 'age', 'get', 'most', 'flick', 'fun', 'ride', 'grew', 'up', 'Joe', 'Dante', 'movies', 'eighties', '***']",The hole  2D metalbox  2D metalbox anglais

I would think that Teri Polo would have a better developed role than a nave mother.",3,A Good Story,1360022400,"02 5, 2013",2013,1033,"['grabbed', 'film', 'watch', 'Joe', 'Dante', 'past', 'directions', ""'ve"", 'enjoyed', 'Gremlins', 'Explorers', 'Innerspace', ""'Burbs"", 'used', 'watch', 'most', 'horror', 'movies', '80s', 'Hole', 'very', 'clich', 'eacute', 'old-school', 'scare', 'today', 'standard', 'Hole', 'story', 'single', 'mother', 'two', 'sons', 'moving', 'new', 'house', 'older', 'son', 'next-door', 'girl', 'three', 'have', 'discovered', 'closed', 'hole', 'basement', 'have', 'navely', 'opened', 'Nothing', 'was', 'seen', 'bottomless', 'pit', 'could', 'discover', 'Then', 'soon', 'slowly', 'things', 'started', 'happen', 'trio.From', 'psychological', 'perspective', 'thought', 'film', 'pretty', 'good', 'idea', 'opening', 'hole', 'door', 'one', 'must', 'face', 'worst', 'fears', 'victories', 'would', 'be', 'achieved', 'when', 'fears', 'are', 'defeated', 'not', 'death', 'would', 'ensure', 'fate.Personally', 'pretty', 'good', 'story', 'yet', 'clich', 'eacute', 'would', 'think', 'Teri', 'Polo', 'would', 'have', 'better', 'developed', 'role', 'nave', 'mother']",The hole  2D metalbox  2D metalbox anglais
1385022,A2LBG038UJDN97,B0044BIZR6,ZombiePanda,"[0, 0]","The Hole is obviously aimed at the tween/teen audience but still delivers some creepy moments for adults.  Good production values, decent acting, interesting plot ('hey, what's with this weird trapdoor in the basement?') and good supporting cast (Teri Polo, Bruce Dern) turn The Hole into a likeable movie.  The special effects mostly take the less-is-more approach and it works well, relying on the viewers imagination to fuel the creep-factor.  The plot borrows elements from other movies (The Gate, Poltergeist) but combines them in an effective manner and makes them its own.  Nothing groundbreaking here, but nothing terrible, either.Expectation is key when watching this movie (or any movie, really).  The Hole is NOT an R-rated horror/gore fest.  It is NOT in the same league as The Ring.  Many of the negative reviews here seem to have missed that cue when watching.  The Hole is a solid, creepy movie that you can watch with your young-teen kids while eating a pizza.  For what it is, it's good.I give The Hole 3-3/4 stars, rounded up to 4.  Definitely worth a watch.",4,Surprisingly creepy,1378166400,"09 3, 2013",2013,1076,"['Hole', 'obviously', 'aimed', 'tween/teen', 'audience', 'still', 'creepy', 'moments', 'adults', 'Good', 'production', 'values', 'decent', 'acting', 'interesting', 'plot', ""'hey"", 'what', 'weird', 'trapdoor', 'basement', 'good', 'supporting', 'cast', 'Teri', 'Polo', 'Bruce', 'Dern', 'turn', 'Hole', 'likeable', 'movie', 'special', 'effects', 'mostly', 'take', 'less-is-more', 'approach', 'well', 'relying', 'viewers', 'imagination', 'fuel', 'creep-factor', 'plot', 'elements', 'other', 'movies', 'Gate', 'Poltergeist', 'effective', 'manner', 'own', 'Nothing', 'groundbreaking', 'here', 'nothing', 'terrible', 'either.Expectation', 'key', 'when', 'watching', 'movie', 'movie', 'really', 'Hole', 'NOT', 'R-rated', 'horror/gore', 'fest', 'NOT', 'same', 'league', 'Ring', 'Many', 'negative', 'reviews', 'here', 'seem', 'have', 'missed', 'cue', 'when', 'watching', 'Hole', 'solid', 'creepy', 'movie', 'can', 'watch', 'young-teen', 'kids', 'eating', 'pizza', 'what', 'good.I', 'give', 'Hole', '3-3/4', 'stars', 'rounded', 'up', '4', 'Definitely', 'watch']",The hole  2D metalbox  2D metalbox anglais
