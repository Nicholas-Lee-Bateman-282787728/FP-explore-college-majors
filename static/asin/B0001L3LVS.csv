Houser,"[65, 67]","I bought this DVD without realizing that it wasn't Balanchine's two-act ""A Midsummer Night's Dream"" (for that you need to purchase the DVD of the Pacific Northwest Ballet's wonderful performance). The confusion is logical, though. Both Ashton's ""The Dream"" and Balanchine's masterpiece were written in the early 60's (Ashton's in 1964, two years after the first performance of Balanchine's work) and both utilize a variety of instrumental and choral music composed by Mendelssohn. It would be hard to believe that Ashton never saw Balanchine's ballet (if he didn't, he certainly listened carefully to the reports of his ballet-world spies).Both ballets are witty and respectful of their Shakespearian source. And both compress their storytelling to a single act (Balanchine tells the story in Act I and dedicates Act II to divertissements.) The confusion and rivalry of the two pairs of lovers (Helena and Demetrius; Hermia and Lysander) is amusingly extenuated in Balanchine's ballet; as is the story of Bottom's overnight conversion into an ass. But the pyrotechnics of the male leads (Oberon and Puck) takes center stage in Ashton's work. Steifel and Cornejo dance these parts brilliantly. And Titania (danced by Alessandra Ferri) is regal without being cold or spiteful (not quite the proto-feminist of Balanchine's ballet). Ashton's ballet has a sustained element of delight and never needs to resort to the tricks employed by Balanchine to dazzle the younger people in his audience (fog machines, cute ballet school students playing butterflies and fairies, and a cable to lift Puck skyward at the end of the ballet). Dance is king in ""The Dream."" Both ballets are great, and for me, Ashton's ""The Dream"" was a great discovery!Sadly, there are no extras on this DVD.",5,Great one-acter!,1086566400,"06 7, 2004",2004,1772,"['bought', 'DVD', 'realizing', 'was', ""n't"", 'Balanchine', 'two-act', 'A', 'Midsummer', 'Night', 'Dream', 'need', 'purchase', 'DVD', 'Pacific', 'Northwest', 'Ballet', 'wonderful', 'performance', 'confusion', 'logical', 'though', 'Ashton', 'Dream', 'Balanchine', 'masterpiece', 'were', 'written', 'early', '60', 'Ashton', '1964', 'two', 'years', 'first', 'performance', 'Balanchine', 'work', 'utilize', 'variety', 'instrumental', 'choral', 'music', 'composed', 'Mendelssohn', 'would', 'be', 'hard', 'believe', 'Ashton', 'never', 'saw', 'Balanchine', 'ballet', 'did', ""n't"", 'certainly', 'listened', 'carefully', 'reports', 'ballet-world', 'spies', '.Both', 'ballets', 'are', 'witty', 'respectful', 'Shakespearian', 'source', 'compress', 'storytelling', 'single', 'act', 'Balanchine', 'story', 'Act', 'Act', 'II', 'divertissements', 'confusion', 'rivalry', 'two', 'pairs', 'lovers', 'Helena', 'Demetrius', 'Hermia', 'Lysander', 'amusingly', 'extenuated', 'Balanchine', 'ballet', 'story', 'Bottom', 'overnight', 'conversion', 'ass', 'pyrotechnics', 'male', 'Oberon', 'Puck', 'center', 'stage', 'Ashton', 'work', 'Steifel', 'Cornejo', 'dance', 'parts', 'brilliantly', 'Titania', 'danced', 'Alessandra', 'Ferri', 'regal', 'being', 'cold', 'spiteful', 'not', 'quite', 'proto-feminist', 'Balanchine', 'ballet', 'Ashton', 'ballet', 'sustained', 'element', 'delight', 'never', 'resort', 'tricks', 'employed', 'Balanchine', 'dazzle', 'younger', 'people', 'audience', 'fog', 'machines', 'cute', 'ballet', 'school', 'students', 'playing', 'butterflies', 'fairies', 'cable', 'lift', 'Puck', 'skyward', 'end', 'ballet', 'Dance', 'king', 'Dream', 'ballets', 'are', 'great', 'Ashton', 'Dream', 'was', 'great', 'discovery', 'Sadly', 'are', 'extras', 'DVD']","Ashton - The Dream / Ethan Stiefel, Alessandra Ferri, Herman Cornejo, American Ballet Theater"

Alessandra Ferri always seems light and graceful and full of passion anyway, so the role of Titania is perfect for her. Though I always enjoy Ethan Stiefel's dancing, I've never been a fan of his acting abilities until now...his arrogant, scheming Oberon blended well with his prowess of technique. The four lovers were entertaining, even if Hermia (and the four faery handmaidens) did use the open-mouthed ""oh my god, s/he did NOT just do that"" routine a few too many times. Herman Cornejo is the perfect Puck in Ashton's vision. The children who watched this ballet with me compared him to Tigger, and that's actually a more accurate description than my adult mind could give him. Bouncy, mischievous, alternately endearing and distratcting...perfect for Puck.The sets and costumes are lovely and ethereal without being overdone. I've seen other productions of this ballet (as well as Balanchine's version) and this one had the best costuming for Oberon by a long shot. I liked that it concentrated on Oberon being the King of the Forest, as opposed to an overly effeminate faery or forcing a purely human machismo the character doesn't possess. But the camera work needed help. It was static when it should have been dynamic, and filled with jump cuts when it should have held a mid shot steadily. But that's typical for ABT videos, I'm afraid. They really need to hire someone else to do their editing because the current editor wastes too much of the skilled dancers' performances.",4,"Beautifully danced, poorly filmed",1170288000,"02 1, 2007",2007,1526,"['dancers', 'were', 'well', 'cast', 'Alessandra', 'Ferri', 'always', 'light', 'graceful', 'full', 'passion', 'anyway', 'role', 'Titania', 'perfect', 'always', 'enjoy', 'Ethan', 'Stiefel', 'dancing', ""'ve"", 'never', 'been', 'fan', 'acting', 'abilities', 'now', 'arrogant', 'scheming', 'Oberon', 'blended', 'well', 'prowess', 'technique', 'four', 'lovers', 'were', 'entertaining', 'even', 'Hermia', 'four', 'faery', 'handmaidens', 'did', 'use', 'open-mouthed', 'oh', 'god', 's/he', 'did', 'NOT', 'just', 'do', 'routine', 'few', 'too', 'many', 'times', 'Herman', 'Cornejo', 'perfect', 'Puck', 'Ashton', 'vision', 'children', 'who', 'watched', 'ballet', 'compared', 'Tigger', 'actually', 'more', 'accurate', 'description', 'adult', 'mind', 'could', 'give', 'Bouncy', 'mischievous', 'alternately', 'endearing', 'distratcting', 'perfect', 'Puck.The', 'sets', 'costumes', 'are', 'lovely', 'ethereal', 'being', 'overdone', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'other', 'productions', 'ballet', 'as', 'well', 'Balanchine', 'version', 'one', 'had', 'best', 'costuming', 'Oberon', 'long', 'shot', 'liked', 'concentrated', 'Oberon', 'being', 'King', 'Forest', 'opposed', 'overly', 'effeminate', 'faery', 'forcing', 'purely', 'human', 'machismo', 'character', ""n't"", 'possess', 'camera', 'work', 'needed', 'help', 'was', 'static', 'when', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'dynamic', 'filled', 'jump', 'cuts', 'when', 'should', 'have', 'held', 'mid', 'shot', 'steadily', 'typical', 'ABT', 'videos', ""'m"", 'afraid', 'really', 'need', 'hire', 'someone', 'else', 'do', 'editing', 'current', 'editor', 'too', 'much', 'skilled', 'dancers', 'performances']","Ashton - The Dream / Ethan Stiefel, Alessandra Ferri, Herman Cornejo, American Ballet Theater"

Rippon ""May 19, 1932 and still going""","[0, 0]","To celebrate the 400th anniversary of the birth of William Shakespeare, the choreographer Frederick Ashton (of whom I am a great fan) decided to make a short one act ballet telling the story of the play A Midsummer Nights Dream. He used the incidental music and vocal score composed by Felix Mendelssohn (arranged by John Lanchbery) for a production of the play in the mid-1800s. The ballet Ashton produced is compact, effective and great fun to watch. It was premiered on April 2, 1964 at Covent Garden, London with Anthony Dowell and Antoinette Sibley as Oberon and Titania. It became very popular with many revivals in London and is performed by many companies world wide. The one on the present disc was made in 2004 for PBS TV series called Dance in America and performed by the American Ballet Theatre group.This is a readily approached, story-ballet that is entertaining to watch and easy to understand. The stars and the corps do an excellent job of relating the plot. The Queen Titania of Alessandra Ferri is dainty and feminine and dances very well. She is not imperious as Titanias tend to be. The Oberon of Ethan Stiefel is a wonder to behold. He is not only and awesome dancer but an excellent mime of an actor as well. He is a glorious performer. Also of glorious technique is the Puck of Herman Cornejo. Sprightly, agile, energetic, superb placement - you could go on and on in describing his dancing. The lovers were well played as was the ruffians and the ass Bottom; a fun bit. The orchestra named here as the Pacific Symphony Orchestra was competently led by Ormsby Wilkins. He never let the pace slacken as this is a fast paced action ballet with no melodrama but is filled with wit and humor.I enjoyed this production very much and love seeing this ballet again and again. As you know there is another, earlier ballet of the same story and music as choreographed by George Balanchine. His version was made for the New York City ballet company in 1962. It is longer and more filled out and I think a greater work of art. The production done some years ago by the Pacific Northwest Ballet is superb. Though this present disc is most enjoyable, the Balanchine remains my favorite.Though some reviewers complained about the film making process, I found it quite adequate.It is great fun and great entertainment.",5,Great Fun with Great Dancers,1402790400,"06 15, 2014",2014,2328,"['celebrate', '400th', 'anniversary', 'birth', 'William', 'Shakespeare', 'choreographer', 'Frederick', 'Ashton', 'whom', 'am', 'great', 'fan', 'decided', 'make', 'short', 'one', 'act', 'ballet', 'telling', 'story', 'play', 'Midsummer', 'Nights', 'Dream', 'used', 'incidental', 'music', 'vocal', 'score', 'composed', 'Felix', 'Mendelssohn', 'arranged', 'John', 'Lanchbery', 'production', 'play', 'mid-1800s', 'ballet', 'Ashton', 'produced', 'compact', 'effective', 'great', 'fun', 'watch', 'was', 'premiered', 'April', '2', '1964', 'Covent', 'Garden', 'London', 'Anthony', 'Dowell', 'Antoinette', 'Sibley', 'Oberon', 'Titania', 'became', 'very', 'popular', 'many', 'revivals', 'London', 'performed', 'many', 'companies', 'world', 'wide', 'one', 'present', 'disc', 'was', 'made', '2004', 'PBS', 'TV', 'series', 'called', 'Dance', 'America', 'performed', 'American', 'Ballet', 'Theatre', 'group.This', 'readily', 'approached', 'story-ballet', 'entertaining', 'watch', 'easy', 'understand', 'stars', 'corps', 'do', 'excellent', 'job', 'relating', 'plot', 'Queen', 'Titania', 'Alessandra', 'Ferri', 'dainty', 'feminine', 'dances', 'very', 'well', 'not', 'imperious', 'Titanias', 'tend', 'be', 'Oberon', 'Ethan', 'Stiefel', 'wonder', 'behold', 'not', 'only', 'awesome', 'dancer', 'excellent', 'mime', 'actor', 'as', 'well', 'glorious', 'performer', 'Also', 'glorious', 'technique', 'Puck', 'Herman', 'Cornejo', 'Sprightly', 'agile', 'energetic', 'superb', 'placement', 'could', 'go', 'describing', 'dancing', 'lovers', 'were', 'well', 'played', 'was', 'ruffians', 'ass', 'Bottom', 'fun', 'bit', 'orchestra', 'named', 'here', 'Pacific', 'Symphony', 'Orchestra', 'was', 'competently', 'led', 'Ormsby', 'Wilkins', 'never', 'let', 'pace', 'slacken', 'fast', 'paced', 'action', 'ballet', 'melodrama', 'filled', 'wit', 'humor.I', 'enjoyed', 'production', 'very', 'much', 'love', 'seeing', 'ballet', 'again', 'again', 'know', 'earlier', 'ballet', 'same', 'story', 'music', 'choreographed', 'George', 'Balanchine', 'version', 'was', 'made', 'New', 'York', 'City', 'ballet', 'company', '1962', 'longer', 'more', 'filled', 'think', 'greater', 'work', 'art', 'production', 'done', 'years', 'ago', 'Pacific', 'Northwest', 'Ballet', 'superb', 'present', 'disc', 'most', 'enjoyable', 'Balanchine', 'favorite.Though', 'reviewers', 'complained', 'film', 'making', 'process', 'found', 'quite', 'great', 'fun', 'great', 'entertainment']","Ashton - The Dream / Ethan Stiefel, Alessandra Ferri, Herman Cornejo, American Ballet Theater"
809618,A3JV7KL1ECLZB8,B0001L3LVS,I. Giles,"[2, 2]","This short ballet, (54 minutes in this performance), by Frederick Ashton was written in 1964 to celebrate the 400th anniversary of Shakespeare's birth. It contained star roles for Antoinette Sibley and Anthony Dowell and the rights to the ballet were left to Dowell in Ashton's will after he died in 1988. Anthony Dowell created this production for the American Theatre ballet seen here.The ballet contains all the hallmarks of Ashton's work having a perfect blend of grace, humour and narrative clarity. These characteristics are portrayed with complete success in this production. All the starring roles, Titania by Alessandra Ferri, Oberon by Ethan Stiefel, Puck by Herman Cornejo, Bottom by Julio Bragado-Young, Hermia by Stella Abrera, Lysander by Carlos Molina, Helena by Marian Butler and Demetrius by Ethan Brown, are played and danced to perfection and it is difficult to imagine a more successful account on those grounds than here.Equally the costuming and staging are completely magical in their effects and the orchestral arrangements of Mendelssohn's music by John Lanchbery are just as Ashton would have wanted I am sure.The whole thing is topped by excellent camera work without any movement blur and in equally clear sound presented in DD 5.1, DTs 5.1 and stereo. Any snags? Well, at just 54 minutes total playing time without any extras, this seems rather pricey. On the other hand, judged purely as artistic value for money, this would probably still score 5 stars. However, we do live in a commercial world. This is still short playing time, there are no extras and it is not a Blu-ray issue even though, recorded in 2004, it could probably be presented as such.For these purely monetary considerations therefore, I feel that, to be fair to other similar products being marketed in a competitive world, a drop of one star to 4 is probably a required judgement.

809619,A32ASMR822BFSE,B0001L3LVS,"Richard Rawls ""Richard Ardle Rawls""","[4, 4]","There are some very good reviews on this ballet from folks much more versed in the art of ballet than I, but I'll betcha most of those buying them are about as knowledgeable as I. You know what YOU think is beautiful and that's about all you need to know.There are several things beautiful about this ballet. Number one, the music by Mendelssohn is some of the most beautiful your ears will ever have the pleasure to hear. But, I'll bet you knew that already. I  listen to his music, and think to myself, ""I'll bet that seventeen year old kid was having a ball writing that music, with the tinkling sound of fairies and the braying of donkeys, and the silly antics of love-struck humans as they are manipulated by an impish Puck and his master Oberon.Number two, the sets and costumes in this production are also very beautiful, and very colorful. The lighting is perfect for a night-time scene, and every one is well lit.Number three, both principle actors are beautiful especially Alessandra Ferri. Just gorgeous. Everyone in the cast looked gorgeous. Well, Ethan Stiefel may not want to be called beautiful, so if not I will change his description to handsome.Number four, even the donkey was beautiful, and I must say I didn't believe that was a man dancing that part because I have never seen a man dance en pointe before, but I played it over and over and I cannot see where anyone changed places with him, so it must have been Julio Bragado-Young dancing that part. He was very good en pointe, by the way. This donkey is much more beautiful than the one in BBC's ""A Midsummer Night's Dream"". The Dream is a 16x9 anamorphic widescreen non-HD DVD version and looks almost as good as an HD DVD played on an HD player. I have the HD DVD version of A Midsummer Night's Dream and the quality of The Dream is just about as good as the HD version.The Dream""s Puck is really the best puck I've seen and that includes Mickey Rooney's Puck in that movie version of A midsummer Night's Dream, made maybe 70 years ago (I'm 77), but I did see that movie not too long ago. Herman Cornejo is a really delightful Puck. OK, his acrobatic dancing is beautiful.This is a very funny ballet, and the scene I think is the funniest is when the lovers Hermia and Lysander are preparing to go to sleep in the woodland glade, the expression on Hermia's face when Lysander feigns such a wound to his ego as she only let him kiss her on the cheek, is worth the price of this DVD, even though I know it isn't at all cheap. All-in-all well worth the money, and you will not be sorry if you buy it. I'm not. Happy viewing. Oh, by the way, you'll know everyone lived happily ever after when you hear Mendelssohn's Wedding March as all the reunited lovers leave the woodland scene for home, to get married of course.",5,A common man's point of view.,1216512000,"07 20, 2008",2008,2789,"['are', 'very', 'good', 'reviews', 'ballet', 'folks', 'much', 'more', 'versed', 'art', 'ballet', ""'ll"", 'betcha', 'most', 'buying', 'are', 'as', 'knowledgeable', 'know', 'what', 'YOU', 'think', 'beautiful', 'need', 'know.There', 'are', 'several', 'things', 'beautiful', 'ballet', 'Number', 'one', 'music', 'Mendelssohn', 'most', 'beautiful', 'ears', 'will', 'ever', 'have', 'pleasure', 'hear', ""'ll"", 'bet', 'knew', 'already', 'listen', 'music', 'think', 'myself', ""'ll"", 'bet', 'seventeen', 'year', 'old', 'kid', 'was', 'having', 'ball', 'writing', 'music', 'tinkling', 'sound', 'fairies', 'braying', 'donkeys', 'silly', 'antics', 'love-struck', 'humans', 'are', 'manipulated', 'impish', 'Puck', 'master', 'Oberon.Number', 'two', 'sets', 'costumes', 'production', 'are', 'also', 'very', 'beautiful', 'very', 'colorful', 'lighting', 'perfect', 'night-time', 'scene', 'one', 'well', 'lit.Number', 'three', 'principle', 'actors', 'are', 'beautiful', 'especially', 'Alessandra', 'Ferri', 'Just', 'gorgeous', 'Everyone', 'cast', 'looked', 'gorgeous', 'Well', 'Ethan', 'Stiefel', 'may', 'not', 'want', 'be', 'called', 'beautiful', 'so', 'not', 'will', 'change', 'description', 'handsome.Number', 'four', 'even', 'donkey', 'was', 'beautiful', 'must', 'say', 'did', ""n't"", 'believe', 'was', 'man', 'dancing', 'part', 'have', 'never', 'seen', 'man', 'dance', 'en', 'pointe', 'played', 'can', 'not', 'see', 'where', 'anyone', 'changed', 'places', 'must', 'have', 'been', 'Julio', 'Bragado-Young', 'dancing', 'part', 'was', 'very', 'good', 'en', 'pointe', 'way', 'donkey', 'much', 'more', 'beautiful', 'one', 'BBC', 'A', 'Midsummer', 'Night', 'Dream', 'Dream', '16x9', 'anamorphic', 'widescreen', 'non-HD', 'DVD', 'version', 'almost', 'as', 'good', 'HD', 'DVD', 'played', 'HD', 'player', 'have', 'HD', 'DVD', 'version', 'A', 'Midsummer', 'Night', 'Dream', 'quality', 'Dream', 'just', 'about', 'as', 'good', 'HD', 'version.The', 'Dream', 's', 'Puck', 'really', 'best', 'puck', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'Mickey', 'Rooney', 'Puck', 'movie', 'version', 'A', 'midsummer', 'Night', 'Dream', 'made', 'maybe', '70', 'years', 'ago', ""'m"", '77', 'did', 'see', 'movie', 'not', 'too', 'long', 'ago', 'Herman', 'Cornejo', 'really', 'delightful', 'Puck', 'OK', 'acrobatic', 'dancing', 'beautiful.This', 'very', 'funny', 'ballet', 'scene', 'think', 'funniest', 'when', 'lovers', 'Hermia', 'Lysander', 'are', 'preparing', 'go', 'sleep', 'woodland', 'glade', 'expression', 'Hermia', 'face', 'when', 'Lysander', 'feigns', 'such', 'wound', 'ego', 'only', 'let', 'kiss', 'cheek', 'price', 'DVD', 'even', 'know', ""n't"", 'cheap', 'All-in-all', 'well', 'money', 'will', 'not', 'be', 'sorry', 'buy', ""'m"", 'not', 'Happy', 'viewing', 'Oh', 'way', ""'ll"", 'know', 'everyone', 'lived', 'happily', 'ever', 'when', 'hear', 'Mendelssohn', 'Wedding', 'March', 'reunited', 'lovers', 'leave', 'woodland', 'scene', 'home', 'get', 'married', 'course']","Ashton - The Dream / Ethan Stiefel, Alessandra Ferri, Herman Cornejo, American Ballet Theater"
