Petrucelli,"[4, 4]","George Carlin says it best: Bruce's genius' was the unique ability to investigate hypocrisy and expose social inequities in a street rap that was really a form of poetry. In this--- the only complete stand-up performance of Bruce ever captured on film --- the iconoclast poet speaks. Loudly. Filmed in 1965 at San Francisco's Basin Street West (in what would be his penultimate live appearance), the show consists of Bruce's responses to the accusations and allegations stemming from his multiple arrests for obscenity and the trials that followed. While the production values are far from superior, it is an important piece of history for humorists and historians to embrace.",4,AN ESSENTIAL PIECE OF HUMOR --- AND HISTORY,1135987200,"12 31, 2005",2005,676,"['George', 'Carlin', 'best', 'Bruce', 'genius', 'was', 'unique', 'ability', 'investigate', 'hypocrisy', 'expose', 'social', 'inequities', 'street', 'rap', 'was', 'really', 'form', 'poetry', 'only', 'complete', 'stand-up', 'performance', 'Bruce', 'ever', 'captured', 'film', 'iconoclast', 'poet', 'speaks', 'Loudly', 'Filmed', '1965', 'San', 'Francisco', 'Basin', 'Street', 'West', 'what', 'would', 'be', 'penultimate', 'live', 'appearance', 'show', 'Bruce', 'responses', 'accusations', 'allegations', 'stemming', 'multiple', 'arrests', 'obscenity', 'trials', 'followed', 'production', 'values', 'are', 'far', 'superior', 'important', 'piece', 'history', 'humorists', 'historians', 'embrace']",N/A
935394,A1GGOC9PVDXW7Z,B000AYNFWQ,Annie Van Auken,"[3, 3]","In the one-hour 1965 video originally called simply ""Lenny Bruce,"" a clearly distracted Lenny thumbs through a NY court transcript and recreates bits that during his trial were misquoted, misinterpreted and maligned. Occasional audience giggles are heard, but only after vulgarities. His listeners are obviously not attuned to Bruce's concerns. Selfishly or otherwise, they want to be entertained.After some amusement over a mime group arrested in a park, Lenny talks of his three obscenity busts and using the transcript as a guide he performs major portions of these routines: T & A, Jackie Kennedy fleeing the limo, Judaism, cheating and male arousal (doing it with a chicken), urinating in the sink and off a ledge, the flasher. Bruce asserts the prosecution's statement that his ""monologues insulted sex, debased it"" has totally confused what is prurient with what is art, and thus this conclusion is legally and logically flawed.Setting aside the papers, Lenny closes with a 20 minute free-association pastiche of his better-known material mixed with random thoughts. In rapid order he covers Alaska, the decorative stone wall behind him, Chicago mobsters disrupting Shelley Berman's act, a Miami Beach heckler who hit Bruce with a wine glass and the bouncer's retaliation, narcotics, a lengthy recreation of the Father Flotsky prison movie, "" 'to' is a preposition, 'come' is a verb."" His closing thought is about jealous men.For any fan of this tortured genius, ""Lenny Bruce"" is a must-see. And for those who enjoy Richard Pryor, George Carlin or Robin Williams, you'll experience here the last flickers of brilliance from the man who inspired them to become comedians.

A master improviser or an addict reeling out of control.By 1965 Bruce was almost bankrupt from legal fights over his material. Much worse he had a strong addiction to heroin. In a year he would be dead.His legal struggles became the main content of his stand-up: he would work on stage from court transcripts. There were moments of  brilliance, and chuckles, but the all encompassing social humor that made Bruce famous, and invoked roaring laughter, was gone. Bruce was angry, broken, sick, and insular.Still, this film does show Bruce's ability to connect loosly associated topics and think on his feet: there are moments here so scadalogical, so amazing in Bruces' abstract thinking, that you can still see what made him great.This is not Bruce at his best, but historically and just to see a genius work, this is essental to watch.",5,Classic,1283126400,"08 30, 2010",2010,940,"['are', 'two', 'ways', 'look', '1965', 'San', 'Fransisco', 'performance', 'one', 'last', 'great', 'Lenny', 'Bruce', 'A', 'master', 'improviser', 'addict', 'reeling', 'control.By', '1965', 'Bruce', 'was', 'almost', 'bankrupt', 'legal', 'fights', 'material', 'Much', 'worse', 'had', 'strong', 'addiction', 'heroin', 'year', 'would', 'be', 'dead.His', 'legal', 'struggles', 'became', 'main', 'content', 'stand-up', 'would', 'work', 'stage', 'court', 'transcripts', 'were', 'moments', 'brilliance', 'chuckles', 'encompassing', 'social', 'humor', 'made', 'Bruce', 'famous', 'invoked', 'roaring', 'laughter', 'was', 'gone', 'Bruce', 'was', 'angry', 'broken', 'sick', 'insular.Still', 'film', 'show', 'Bruce', 'ability', 'connect', 'loosly', 'associated', 'topics', 'think', 'feet', 'are', 'moments', 'here', 'so', 'scadalogical', 'so', 'amazing', 'Bruces', 'abstract', 'thinking', 'can', 'still', 'see', 'what', 'made', 'great.This', 'not', 'Bruce', 'best', 'historically', 'just', 'see', 'genius', 'work', 'essental', 'watch']",N/A
935396,A10MZ3AMQFX9N0,B000AYNFWQ,Jazz Person,"[1, 2]","Lenny Bruce was not ""dirty"". He did not tell dirty jokes. The reason he is still current is that is that he was truly funny. This does not mean that he wasn't also insightful and brilliant. It's just that he was able to translate it into comedy.One thing that separates him from just about everyone who followed him is that he was spontaneous. He did not do the same routine exactly the same way twice. I believe that this is because he identified with jazz musicians. Comedians today generally recite their routines and hope for the best.The result of this spontaneous feeling on the part of Lenny Bruce is that he has marvelous rapport with his audience. That is what you can experience when you watch this performance film.Sometimes in his routines he will create dialogues between several characters - and you will believe you are witnessing their interaction. He has compassion. He can feel what others are experiencing.Most critics miss the point. They usually do. They concentrate on everything but the essence. Lenny Bruce is funny. He likes to perform.

By that time, he appeared on stage with a court manuscript talking about all of the mistakes the peace officer made who wrote down his act and used his notes as evidence of Lenny's obscenity. Bruce was ultimately found guilty on that evidence and this film was Bruce's rebuttal to the verdict.Unfortunately, the performance is not funny. Funny is Lenny Live at Carnegie Hall, his albums and the ""Thank You Masked Man"" cartoon included on this DVD. If you are familiar with Bruce's work before seeing this you will likely be filled with little more than just sadness at the sight of what years of legal problems did to a funny man.It's a good historical document and if you want laughs, at least the cartoon is funny but you will find much better examples of Lenny Bruce the comic in all of his glory on his albums and the exhaustive box set ""Let The Buyer Beware""",2,Good historical document.

His biography by Goldman does a complete dive into Bruce's life including discussing all of his famous bits in detail giving great context as to why they were funny at the time.  I also highly recommend the book Honey about his wife who was truly fascinating.Now, as to this performance within a year of his death.  First, all readings talk of how terrible he looked and how heavy.  Sorry, I didn't see it.  Looked pretty normal to me. Not in shape but not a slob like so often is portrayed.  Having listened to a few of his records and been umimpressed with the comedy, I would say that this is as good a recording as you can expect from this period of time.  Is this hilarious?  No.  Does it drone on about his legal proceedings? yes, but admittedly, he does present a logical argument while trying to incorporate fun.I love the theory of Lenny Bruce.  But he won't change lives by listening to this performance.  My opinion is you have to have lived during that time and ""felt"" the oppressive society to really understand the genius of Lenny Bruce.  overall, I'm glad I watched and agree that the Masked Man six minute comic strip at the end is worth the watch.

It is the only time in his all-too-brief career that Lenny's nightclub act was filmed from begining to end.This is Lenny at the end of his life. It is August of 1965 and he has less than a year to live. The effects of four years of unrelenting persecution and personal self destruction are painfully evedent. He's not the Lenny of 1959: The hyper-energetic, brilliant young comic who burst apon the national consciousness with two riotous appearances on the Steve Allen Show. By the summer of 1965 it is obvious to even the most casual of viewers that Lenny Bruce is a broken, dying man.And yet, even in this tragic condition, he is still screamingly funny. Some people have criticized his obsession with the American legal system during this period as ponderous and rambling. But when viewed within the context of historical  hindsight and a knowledge of his own personal saga, Lenny's observations are fresh and eye opening.A writer from Newsweek once refered to Lenny Bruce as ""a sad, sick, self destructive genius of a dirty time"".
