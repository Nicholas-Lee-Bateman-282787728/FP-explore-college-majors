496923,ACPLJ6XRXIZKD,B00000F2NF,Cheated,"[26, 26]","Episode One - &quot;From Vaudeville to Movies&quot; (1895-1924): This 3-part video collection opens with a fantastic collage of scenes of the  various pratfalls from Buster's early silent career. Then it starts at his  birth, explaining the vaudeville act he had with mom and dad. Quitting that  at 21, he rents himself out under the employ of Roscoe &quot;Fatty&quot;  Arbuckle, who becomes Buster's mentor and teacher in front of and behind  the camera. Various scenes from their shorts are shown (1917-20). When  Arbuckle goes on to loftier projects, Buster is given his own studio, and  scenes from the 2-reel shorts he made there are shown (1920-23). Episode  One continues with scenes of his wedding to Natalie Talmadge and Arbuckle's  (he was probably framed) trial for murder. Towards the end we are shown  life-threatening stunts that Buster made in the films &quot;Our  Hospitality&quot; (1923) and &quot;Sherlock Jr.&quot; (1924): hanging  upside down by a rope tied around his waist over a waterfall...accidentally  being whisked away through speeding river rapids that almost drowned  him...and breaking his neck over plunging water from a water tower  spout.Episode Two - &quot;Star Without a Studio&quot; (1924-1933): By  1924, he had graduated to feature-length films (7 reels). Shown are the 3  mansions he had purchased with his growing fortune. By this time, he was  earning $3,000 a week (by comparison, I think a small family could live on  $60 a week in L.A. at that time). A great deal of footage is shown of his  classic films &quot;The Navigator&quot;, &quot;The General&quot;,  &quot;Steamboat Bill Jr.&quot;, etc. The second half of Episode Two is  devoted to his being signed over to MGM studios, where they minimized his  creativity and independence. Scenes are shown of the films he made there  (1928-33), which made a lot of money, but were substandard in quality from  Buster's point of view, and which his friends explain, on camera, might  have caused the drinking problem that developed at this time. The inability  to handle alcohol caused his excessive absenteeism from workdays, leading  to his discharge from MGM in 1933.Episode Three - &quot;A Genius  Recognized&quot; (1934-1966): Because of the drinking problem, Buster was  basically blackballed from working at other major studios, but was signed  by a low budget company called Educational Pictures to do 2-reel shorts.  These were lesser in quality from the shorts he made in the early 20's, due  to their short (a few days) shooting schedules and skimpy financial  budgets. Scenes are shown of these, including one he made where his mom,  brother and sister were included in the cast. After Educational went  bankrupt in 1937, Buster was hired back at MGM, but only as a gag writer  for other big stars - at 10% of his previous MGM salary. Episode Three then  (curiously) skips about 10 years of his life (even though significant work  was made during those years) and continues with his TV work in the 50's.  The last part of Episode Three explains his re-discovery in the 60's as a  film genius and ends with scenes that show his health had deteriorated from  the effects of a lifetime of chain smoking.Although this 3-volume set is  the best analysis I've seen on Buster's life, at least 5 volumes would be  needed to do his work justice. After I viewed this collection, I thought of  a zillion other scenes from his films that deserved to be included. But  I've watched it numerous times anyway and never seem to tire of it.",5,Best Documentary of Buster's Life,966470400,"08 17, 2000",2000,3525,"['Episode', 'One', 'quot', 'From', 'Vaudeville', 'Movies', 'quot', '1895-1924', '3-part', 'video', 'collection', 'fantastic', 'collage', 'scenes', 'various', 'pratfalls', 'Buster', 'early', 'silent', 'career', 'Then', 'birth', 'explaining', 'vaudeville', 'act', 'had', 'mom', 'dad', 'Quitting', '21', 'out', 'employ', 'Roscoe', 'quot', 'Fatty', 'quot', 'Arbuckle', 'who', 'Buster', 'mentor', 'teacher', 'front', 'camera', 'Various', 'scenes', 'shorts', 'are', 'shown', '1917-20', 'When', 'Arbuckle', 'loftier', 'projects', 'Buster', 'given', 'own', 'studio', 'scenes', '2-reel', 'shorts', 'made', 'are', 'shown', '1920-23', 'Episode', 'One', 'scenes', 'wedding', 'Natalie', 'Talmadge', 'Arbuckle', 'was', 'probably', 'framed', 'trial', 'murder', 'end', 'are', 'shown', 'life-threatening', 'stunts', 'Buster', 'made', 'films', 'quot', 'Hospitality', 'quot', '1923', 'quot', 'Sherlock', 'Jr.', 'quot', '1924', 'hanging', 'upside', 'down', 'rope', 'tied', 'waist', 'waterfall', 'accidentally', 'being', 'whisked', 'away', 'speeding', 'river', 'rapids', 'almost', 'drowned', 'breaking', 'neck', 'plunging', 'water', 'water', 'tower', 'spout.Episode', 'Two', 'quot', 'Star', 'Studio', 'quot', '1924-1933', '1924', 'had', 'graduated', 'feature-length', 'films', '7', 'reels', 'Shown', 'are', '3', 'mansions', 'had', 'purchased', 'growing', 'fortune', 'time', 'was', 'earning', '3,000', 'week', 'comparison', 'think', 'small', 'family', 'could', 'live', '60', 'week', 'L.A.', 'time', 'great', 'deal', 'footage', 'shown', 'classic', 'films', 'quot', 'Navigator', 'quot', 'quot', 'General', 'quot', 'quot', 'Steamboat', 'Bill', 'Jr.', 'quot', 'etc', 'second', 'half', 'Episode', 'Two', 'devoted', 'being', 'signed', 'MGM', 'studios', 'where', 'minimized', 'creativity', 'independence', 'Scenes', 'are', 'shown', 'films', 'made', '1928-33', 'made', 'lot', 'money', 'were', 'substandard', 'quality', 'Buster', 'point', 'view', 'friends', 'explain', 'camera', 'might', 'have', 'caused', 'drinking', 'problem', 'developed', 'time', 'inability', 'handle', 'alcohol', 'caused', 'excessive', 'absenteeism', 'workdays', 'leading', 'discharge', 'MGM', '1933.Episode', 'Three', 'quot', 'Genius', 'Recognized', 'quot', '1934-1966', 'drinking', 'problem', 'Buster', 'was', 'basically', 'blackballed', 'working', 'other', 'major', 'studios', 'was', 'signed', 'low', 'budget', 'company', 'called', 'Educational', 'Pictures', 'do', '2-reel', 'shorts', 'were', 'lesser', 'quality', 'shorts', 'made', 'early', '20', 'due', 'short', 'few', 'days', 'shooting', 'schedules', 'skimpy', 'financial', 'budgets', 'Scenes', 'are', 'shown', 'including', 'one', 'made', 'where', 'mom', 'brother', 'sister', 'were', 'included', 'cast', 'Educational', 'went', 'bankrupt', '1937', 'Buster', 'was', 'hired', 'back', 'MGM', 'only', 'gag', 'writer', 'other', 'big', 'stars', '10', '%', 'previous', 'MGM', 'salary', 'Episode', 'Three', 'then', 'curiously', '10', 'years', 'life', 'even', 'significant', 'work', 'was', 'made', 'years', 'TV', 'work', '50', 'last', 'part', 'Episode', 'Three', 're-discovery', '60', 'film', 'genius', 'scenes', 'show', 'health', 'had', 'deteriorated', 'effects', 'lifetime', 'chain', '3-volume', 'set', 'best', 'analysis', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'Buster', 'life', 'least', '5', 'volumes', 'would', 'be', 'needed', 'do', 'work', 'justice', 'viewed', 'collection', 'thought', 'zillion', 'other', 'scenes', 'films', 'deserved', 'be', 'included', ""'ve"", 'watched', 'numerous', 'times', 'anyway', 'never', 'seem', 'tire']",Buster Keaton - A Hard Act to Follow VHS

496925,A3VULVJ7BJW3KR,B00000F2NF,"""harpo99""","[26, 27]","About 7 years ago, I saw an one-hour biography TV program on Buster Keaton in my home country, Japan.  The approach to the entire life story on Buster that the program organized could be best summarized in some descriptions:  &quot;The Great Stone Face formed by his father's abusive training in his childhood&quot;, &quot;Acrobatic performance that is one-inch-close to death&quot; or &quot;Happy ending of his life after lifelong loneliness&quot; and so on and on.  Until I had a chance to see this &quot;Buster Keaton - A Hard Act to Follow&quot; I used to have no doubt what a sad clown Buster was -- even sadder than Charlie Chaplin.This 3-hour documentary, however, completely smashed down my biased understanding on Buster and was truely eye-opening in this sense.  One of what few know here in Japan is that Buster made several appearances on TV and even hosted his own program -- while Charlie never allowed himself to go into TV business, with his good intentions, of course.  In Japan, such words as &quot;classic comedy&quot;, &quot;silent movie&quot; or &quot;slapsticks&quot; are practically (and almost automatically) synonymous with Charlie, and as a result, only Charlie gets the majority of attention and the &quot;runner-up&quot; could be Buster, only if you know him, that is.  Also, what I never understand is that quite a few Japanese &quot;intelligentsias&quot; publicly rush into a rash comparison &quot;Buster is dry and cool, while Chalie is so easy to resort to pathos&quot;.  Why don't they just give a closer look at both respectively (and respectfully!) and accept that they are BOTH great?!  Isn't that enough?  &quot;Buster Keaton - A Hard Act to Follow&quot; -- this is the perfect solution to people with such ideas!",5,No need to compare him with Charlie -- BOTH are just GREAT!,974332800,"11 16, 2000",2000,1750,"['7', 'years', 'ago', 'saw', 'one-hour', 'biography', 'TV', 'program', 'Buster', 'Keaton', 'home', 'country', 'Japan', 'approach', 'entire', 'life', 'story', 'Buster', 'program', 'organized', 'could', 'be', 'best', 'summarized', 'descriptions', 'quot', 'Great', 'Stone', 'Face', 'formed', 'father', 'abusive', 'training', 'childhood', 'quot', 'quot', 'Acrobatic', 'performance', 'one-inch-close', 'death', 'quot', 'quot', 'Happy', 'ending', 'life', 'lifelong', 'loneliness', 'quot', 'so', 'had', 'chance', 'see', 'quot', 'Buster', 'Keaton', 'Hard', 'Act', 'Follow', 'quot', 'used', 'have', 'doubt', 'what', 'sad', 'clown', 'Buster', 'was', 'even', 'sadder', 'Charlie', 'Chaplin.This', '3-hour', 'documentary', 'however', 'completely', 'smashed', 'biased', 'understanding', 'Buster', 'was', 'truely', 'eye-opening', 'sense', 'One', 'what', 'few', 'know', 'here', 'Japan', 'Buster', 'made', 'several', 'appearances', 'TV', 'even', 'hosted', 'own', 'program', 'Charlie', 'never', 'allowed', 'go', 'TV', 'business', 'good', 'intentions', 'course', 'Japan', 'such', 'words', 'quot', 'classic', 'comedy', 'quot', 'quot', 'silent', 'movie', 'quot', 'quot', 'slapsticks', 'quot', 'are', 'practically', 'almost', 'automatically', 'synonymous', 'Charlie', 'result', 'only', 'Charlie', 'majority', 'attention', 'quot', 'runner-up', 'quot', 'could', 'be', 'Buster', 'only', 'know', 'Also', 'what', 'never', 'understand', 'quite', 'few', 'Japanese', 'quot', 'intelligentsias', 'quot', 'publicly', 'rash', 'comparison', 'quot', 'Buster', 'dry', 'cool', 'Chalie', 'so', 'easy', 'resort', 'pathos', 'quot', 'Why', 'do', ""n't"", 'just', 'give', 'closer', 'look', 'respectively', 'respectfully', 'accept', 'are', 'great', ""n't"", 'enough', 'quot', 'Buster', 'Keaton', 'Hard', 'Act', 'Follow', 'quot', 'perfect', 'solution', 'people', 'such', 'ideas']",Buster Keaton - A Hard Act to Follow VHS

496929,A220FJEQNGMSRN,B00000F2NF,Trevor Willsmer,"[3, 3]","NB: Although long out of print on video in the US, those with multi-region DVD players should be aware that Network DVD have released this title on PAL DVD in the UK.From the same stable as the superb Unknown Chaplin and the legendary Hollywood series, this three-part 1987 TV series is easily the best documentary on the great stone-faced comedian, and comes with the added advantage of a wealth of radio and television interview material with the man himself to draw on. Yet it suffers somewhat in comparison despite highlights such as its comprehensive account of the making of The General, which includes interviews with extras and sightseers at the film's spectacular battle scene, as well as home movie footage of Keaton at work. Partially this is due to its tendency toward the 'sad clown' approach that is, if not hidden, at least bolstered by its attention to detail, but perhaps more importantly it at times gives the feeling of preaching to the converted. Where their Hollywood TV series was an eye-opener that managed to completely dispel the patronising contempt or superiority many felt for silent cinema by restoring it to its original element, here Kevin Brownlow and David Gill take Keaton's genius too much for granted.Still, while many of the extracts aren't likely to make any new converts, they do illustrate the extraordinary technical precision and danger involved in shooting them. Consequently, the extraordinarily accomplished scene where Buster is trapped within the film in Sherlock Junior is dealt with in depth, but the simpler, and much funnier, billiard sequence that demonstrates a different kind of cinematic imagination is completely absent. As a result, while Keaton's fans will find much to embrace, as an introduction to his work it to the uninitiated it tends to marginalise him as more of an inspired craftsman than a great comic.If many of the warmest and funniest moments of his silent work are missing, so too is the star's Beach Blanket Bingo era when he turned up in bit parts in teen movies, or his TV work, such as his Twilight Zone episode that boasted a couple of outstanding pieces of physical comedy). Even A Funny Thing Happened to Me On the Way to the Forum seems tagged on as an afterthought, leaving a slight impression of, not so much rewriting history, but at the very least ignoring the bits which don't gel with his critical rediscovery at that time.Highly recommended nonetheless, it does make you hungry to see more of the man's work. Despite the age of the material, picture quality is excellent throughout, with the extracts being shown at the correct speed, while full credits for all three episodes are retained. Carl Davis' sympathetic scoring works well, with the extracts from his score for The General a particular highlight.",5,"Not quite up to the standard of Unknown Chaplin, but easily the best documentary about the Great Stone Face - on DVD in the UK",1292716800,"12 19, 2010",2010,2794,"['NB', 'long', 'print', 'video', 'US', 'multi-region', 'DVD', 'players', 'should', 'be', 'aware', 'Network', 'DVD', 'have', 'released', 'title', 'PAL', 'DVD', 'UK.From', 'same', 'stable', 'superb', 'Unknown', 'Chaplin', 'legendary', 'Hollywood', 'series', 'three-part', '1987', 'TV', 'series', 'easily', 'best', 'documentary', 'great', 'stone-faced', 'comedian', 'added', 'advantage', 'wealth', 'radio', 'television', 'interview', 'material', 'man', 'draw', 'somewhat', 'comparison', 'highlights', 'such', 'comprehensive', 'account', 'making', 'General', 'interviews', 'extras', 'sightseers', 'film', 'spectacular', 'battle', 'scene', 'as', 'well', 'home', 'movie', 'footage', 'Keaton', 'work', 'Partially', 'due', 'tendency', ""'sad"", 'clown', 'approach', 'not', 'hidden', 'least', 'bolstered', 'attention', 'detail', 'perhaps', 'more', 'importantly', 'times', 'feeling', 'preaching', 'converted', 'Where', 'Hollywood', 'TV', 'series', 'was', 'eye-opener', 'managed', 'completely', 'dispel', 'patronising', 'contempt', 'superiority', 'many', 'felt', 'silent', 'cinema', 'restoring', 'original', 'element', 'here', 'Kevin', 'Brownlow', 'David', 'Gill', 'take', 'Keaton', 'genius', 'too', 'much', 'granted.Still', 'many', 'extracts', 'are', ""n't"", 'likely', 'make', 'new', 'converts', 'do', 'illustrate', 'extraordinary', 'technical', 'precision', 'danger', 'involved', 'shooting', 'Consequently', 'extraordinarily', 'accomplished', 'scene', 'where', 'Buster', 'trapped', 'film', 'Sherlock', 'Junior', 'dealt', 'depth', 'simpler', 'much', 'funnier', 'billiard', 'sequence', 'different', 'kind', 'cinematic', 'imagination', 'completely', 'absent', 'result', 'Keaton', 'fans', 'will', 'find', 'much', 'embrace', 'introduction', 'work', 'uninitiated', 'marginalise', 'more', 'inspired', 'craftsman', 'great', 'comic.If', 'many', 'warmest', 'funniest', 'moments', 'silent', 'work', 'are', 'missing', 'so', 'too', 'star', 'Beach', 'Blanket', 'Bingo', 'era', 'when', 'turned', 'up', 'bit', 'parts', 'teen', 'movies', 'TV', 'work', 'such', 'Twilight', 'Zone', 'episode', 'boasted', 'couple', 'outstanding', 'pieces', 'physical', 'comedy', 'Even', 'Funny', 'Thing', 'Happened', 'Me', 'Way', 'Forum', 'tagged', 'afterthought', 'leaving', 'slight', 'impression', 'not', 'so', 'much', 'rewriting', 'history', 'very', 'least', 'ignoring', 'bits', 'do', ""n't"", 'gel', 'critical', 'rediscovery', 'time.Highly', 'recommended', 'nonetheless', 'make', 'hungry', 'see', 'more', 'man', 'work', 'age', 'material', 'picture', 'quality', 'excellent', 'extracts', 'being', 'shown', 'correct', 'speed', 'full', 'credits', 'three', 'episodes', 'are', 'retained', 'Carl', 'Davis', 'sympathetic', 'scoring', 'works', 'well', 'extracts', 'score', 'General', 'particular', 'highlight']",Buster Keaton - A Hard Act to Follow VHS
