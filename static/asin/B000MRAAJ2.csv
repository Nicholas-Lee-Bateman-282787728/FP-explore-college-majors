1050342,A1XBD88AGPPUM8,B000MRAAJ2,ALAN CHAMBERS,"[0, 0]",I've been a fan of the Moody Blues for over forty years and marvel at the fact that they're still going strong today. Many young people have become fans since I first experienced their music in 1970. I think they will go down as one of the best groups in the history of rock n roll and the fact that they're still touring backs that up. A good DVD for any Moody Blues fan,5,A Legendary Band,1371254400,"06 15, 2013",2013,371,"[""'ve"", 'been', 'fan', 'Moody', 'Blues', 'forty', 'years', 'marvel', 'fact', ""'re"", 'still', 'going', 'strong', 'today', 'Many', 'young', 'people', 'have', 'become', 'fans', 'first', 'experienced', 'music', '1970', 'think', 'will', 'go', 'down', 'as', 'one', 'best', 'groups', 'history', 'rock', 'roll', 'fact', ""'re"", 'still', 'touring', 'backs', 'up', 'good', 'DVD', 'Moody', 'Blues', 'fan']",Moody Blues: Classic Artists
1050343,A32T2H8150OJLU,B000MRAAJ2,ARH,"[2, 2]","First of all, I've been familiar with the music of The Moody Blues since at least the mid-1970s, maybe even earlier than that.  I still have vinyl copies of some of their albums, e.g., ""In Search of the Lost Chord"", and ""On the Threshold of a Dream"", and I am familiar with their music from ""Days of Future Past"" through at least ""Sur la Mer.""  I kind of lost track of them after that, but they remain a personal favorite.This DVD includes extensive footage of all stages of the history of The Moody Blues, as well as lots of interview footage with the long-term principles of the band - Graeme Edge, John Lodge, Mike Pinder, Justin Hayward, and Ray Thomas, as well as others who were involved with the band through the years.  I found these reflective interviews to be fascinating, and to provide insights into not only the history of the band, but into their origins, interests, challenges, philosophies, and goals.If all I based this review on was the content of the interviews then this DVD would earn a clear 5 star rating.  However, there is more to a documentary than content.  There is also quality of film, editing, and presentation.  The footage of the band through the years was culled from a variety of sources, some better than others, and the interviews were, frankly, not staged very well.  They almost came across as being somewhat amateurish.  They were, nevertheless, engaging.I enjoyed sitting through the entire 152 minutes of the DVD.Perhaps the reason I enjoyed the experience so much is that, as is clearly showed in this documentary, The Moody Blues are a class act.  They generated music spanning a wide range of styles, including pop, rock, psychedelic, folk, and concept music, and more.  I still enjoy music of The Moody Blues, and at least some of their tracks appear regularly on my iPod playlists, and on radio stations I prefer.  Their music is timeless.  They are also great performers and are known for treating their fans well.  It's a tribute to them that they and their music are still so well known, and three members of the group were still touring as recently as 2011...I haven't heard anything about a 2012 tour.Anyway, this is a 5-star experience for the dedicated Moody Blues fan, and probably a 4-star offering for everyone else...so I'll post this as a 4 star product.Great stuff though!",4,"Fantastic experience for a fan of The Moody Blues...though as a video experience, there are a few weaknesses",1299888000,"03 12, 2011",2011,2332,"['First', ""'ve"", 'been', 'familiar', 'music', 'Moody', 'Blues', 'least', 'mid-1970s', 'maybe', 'even', 'earlier', 'still', 'have', 'vinyl', 'copies', 'albums', 'e.g.', 'Search', 'Lost', 'Chord', 'Threshold', 'Dream', 'am', 'familiar', 'music', 'Days', 'Future', 'Past', 'least', 'Sur', 'la', 'Mer', 'kind', 'lost', 'track', 'remain', 'personal', 'favorite.This', 'DVD', 'extensive', 'footage', 'stages', 'history', 'Moody', 'Blues', 'as', 'well', 'lots', 'interview', 'footage', 'long-term', 'principles', 'band', 'Graeme', 'Edge', 'John', 'Lodge', 'Mike', 'Pinder', 'Justin', 'Hayward', 'Ray', 'Thomas', 'as', 'well', 'others', 'who', 'were', 'involved', 'band', 'years', 'found', 'reflective', 'interviews', 'be', 'fascinating', 'provide', 'insights', 'not', 'only', 'history', 'band', 'origins', 'interests', 'challenges', 'philosophies', 'goals.If', 'based', 'review', 'was', 'content', 'interviews', 'then', 'DVD', 'would', 'earn', 'clear', '5', 'star', 'rating', 'However', 'more', 'documentary', 'content', 'also', 'quality', 'film', 'editing', 'presentation', 'footage', 'band', 'years', 'was', 'culled', 'variety', 'sources', 'better', 'others', 'interviews', 'were', 'frankly', 'not', 'staged', 'very', 'well', 'almost', 'came', 'being', 'somewhat', 'amateurish', 'were', 'nevertheless', 'engaging.I', 'enjoyed', 'sitting', 'entire', '152', 'minutes', 'DVD.Perhaps', 'reason', 'enjoyed', 'experience', 'so', 'much', 'that', 'clearly', 'showed', 'documentary', 'Moody', 'Blues', 'are', 'class', 'act', 'generated', 'music', 'spanning', 'wide', 'range', 'styles', 'including', 'pop', 'rock', 'psychedelic', 'folk', 'concept', 'music', 'more', 'still', 'enjoy', 'music', 'Moody', 'Blues', 'least', 'tracks', 'appear', 'regularly', 'iPod', 'playlists', 'radio', 'stations', 'prefer', 'music', 'timeless', 'are', 'also', 'great', 'performers', 'are', 'known', 'treating', 'fans', 'well', 'tribute', 'music', 'are', 'still', 'so', 'well', 'known', 'three', 'members', 'group', 'were', 'still', 'touring', 'as', 'recently', '2011', 'have', ""n't"", 'heard', 'anything', '2012', 'tour.Anyway', '5-star', 'experience', 'dedicated', 'Moody', 'Blues', 'fan', 'probably', '4-star', 'offering', 'everyone', 'else', 'so', ""'ll"", 'post', '4', 'star', 'product.Great', 'stuff']",Moody Blues: Classic Artists

They should have spent more time on the years of '67 to the present and, may I add, they skipped discussing some albums entirely (The Other Side of Life, Keys of the Kingdom, and Strange Times).

1050355,A35DI28HRSEEP6,B000MRAAJ2,Richard B. Schwartz,"[7, 7]","There is no official 'biography' of the band, but there are many filmed bits and pieces floating around that are familiar to Moody fandom.  This dvd, however, brings together a plethora of fresh material that not only provides a rich sense of the band's history and the sources of its success, but also answers questions concerning the departures from the band of Denny Laine, Mike Pinder, and Ray Thomas.  It is exceptionally candid.  Things are said that one does not expect to hear said in a day of rabid, unending litigation.  There are some omissions--no interviews with Gordon Marshall or Paul Bliss (nor from Patrick Moraz, though no one would expect him to make himself available) and the odd overlooking of the Keys to the Kingdom album and some other later work.  It is especially nice to see the members of the band in their native habitats--Justin in Monaco, Graeme in Florida, etc.The focus is exclusively on the music; there is nothing, e.g., on John's love of golf and Rhone wines or on any of the band's philanthropic work.  There is also next to nothing on their families, except for some asides on key divorces.

1050357,ACVFTS9X2MKJ8,B000MRAAJ2,"Rykre ""The Rogue Scholar""","[9, 13]","This DVD documentary of The Moody Blues is okay for watching maybe once.  I mean, there were lots of interesting facts about The Moody Blues, most of which I've already learned about on their ""Legend of a Band"" DVD.  However, this DVD does go into great detail about the earlier Denny Laine days.  In fact, Denny Laine today has a lot of dialogue to share about their humble beginnings (the ""Go Now"" days) as the first original member of The Moody Blues.  The main DVD of this The Moody Blues DVD (Disc One) is about 2 and a half hours long.  The first 48 minutes is about the Denny Laine days before John Lodge and Justin Hayward.  And then this documentary goes into about 50 minutes of their main seven albums (""Days of Future Passed"" through to ""Seventh Sojourn"").  It seems like they blew though discussing these albums rather quickly.  And then the last 50 minutes discussed their follow-up albums up through today.Even some artists like Ian Anderson (of Jethro Tull) and Eric Burdon (The Animals) were here to discuss their involvement (or their non-involvement) with The Moody Blues.The second DVD starts with about an hour of insignificant dialogue from some of the band members and others involved with The Moody Blues.  Nothing very interesting here.  I don't think I'll ever watch that DVD again.  It just went nowhere all through it.  It is followed by some of their music videos starting with a simulated video of ""Go Now"" up through ""No More Lies.""  What I didn't like about the videos here are that they cropped them to have a simulated wide screen effect.  The top and the bottom of the videos were cut off.  On the ""Legend of a Band"" DVD, the videos are presented in their correct full screen version.  Plus, on the ""Legend of a Band"" DVD, it had the video of ""The Other Side of Life"" which I think is a great (and important) video.The third disc in this package is a 22 minute CD of some really scratchy sounding recorded songs from Saints and Sinners, El Riot and the Rebels, Gerry Levene and the Avengers, The Carpet Baggers, Denny Laine and the Diplomats, an early Justin Hayward song and an early Moody Blues demo.  It's early history of the bands where some of these guys came from before The Moody Blues, so it may have some value to some serious Moody Blues completists.On this documentary, you do get a lot of discussion from Mike Pinder, Graeme Edge, Denny Laine, and some from John Lodge and Justin Hayward.  And also Ian Anderson and Eric Burdon.  It's funny, you know if Eric Burdon wore some wire glasses, he would look exactly like the real-life image of Grandpa Simpson (from the TV show ""The Simpsons).And it seems to be rather strange how Patrick Moraz remains such a mystique.  You never see him on any documentaries of The Moody Blues, or even Yes.  Why is he so hard to get a hold of?  I'd like to hear some of his personal input of his impressive career.Most people may just want to rent this Moody Blues DVD first.  I mean, there is a lot of unnecessary information put together in this 3 disc set.  I wish it were just released as a single DVD (just Disc One), at half the cost than what this was.  To be honest, I still think ""Legend of a Band"" is a better documentary of The Moody Blues (even though it barely talks about the ""Go Now"" days, and that it only covered The Moody Blues up to about 1990).  I guess it doesn't hurt to own both, but the more casual Moody Blues fan may be more satisfied with the ""Legend of a Band"" documentary.",3,An overkill of candid dialogue,1181779200,"06 14, 2007",2007,3481,"['DVD', 'documentary', 'Moody', 'Blues', 'okay', 'watching', 'maybe', 'once', 'mean', 'were', 'lots', 'interesting', 'facts', 'Moody', 'Blues', 'most', ""'ve"", 'already', 'learned', 'Legend', 'Band', 'DVD', 'However', 'DVD', 'go', 'great', 'detail', 'earlier', 'Denny', 'Laine', 'days', 'fact', 'Denny', 'Laine', 'today', 'lot', 'dialogue', 'share', 'humble', 'beginnings', 'Go', 'Now', 'days', 'first', 'original', 'member', 'Moody', 'Blues', 'main', 'DVD', 'Moody', 'Blues', 'DVD', 'Disc', 'One', '2', 'half', 'hours', 'long', 'first', '48', 'minutes', 'Denny', 'Laine', 'days', 'John', 'Lodge', 'Justin', 'Hayward', 'then', 'documentary', '50', 'minutes', 'main', 'seven', 'albums', 'Days', 'Future', 'Passed', 'Seventh', 'Sojourn', 'blew', 'discussing', 'albums', 'rather', 'quickly', 'then', 'last', '50', 'minutes', 'discussed', 'follow-up', 'albums', 'up', 'today.Even', 'artists', 'Ian', 'Anderson', 'Jethro', 'Tull', 'Eric', 'Burdon', 'Animals', 'were', 'here', 'discuss', 'involvement', 'non-involvement', 'Moody', 'Blues.The', 'second', 'DVD', 'hour', 'insignificant', 'dialogue', 'band', 'members', 'others', 'involved', 'Moody', 'Blues', 'Nothing', 'very', 'interesting', 'here', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', ""'ll"", 'ever', 'watch', 'DVD', 'again', 'just', 'went', 'nowhere', 'followed', 'music', 'starting', 'simulated', 'video', 'Go', 'Now', 'up', 'No', 'More', 'What', 'did', ""n't"", 'like', 'videos', 'here', 'are', 'cropped', 'have', 'simulated', 'wide', 'screen', 'effect', 'top', 'bottom', 'videos', 'were', 'cut', 'off', 'Legend', 'Band', 'DVD', 'videos', 'are', 'presented', 'correct', 'full', 'screen', 'version', 'Legend', 'Band', 'DVD', 'had', 'video', 'Other', 'Side', 'Life', 'think', 'great', 'important', 'video.The', 'third', 'disc', 'package', '22', 'minute', 'CD', 'really', 'scratchy', 'sounding', 'recorded', 'songs', 'Saints', 'Sinners', 'El', 'Riot', 'Rebels', 'Gerry', 'Levene', 'Avengers', 'Carpet', 'Baggers', 'Denny', 'Laine', 'Diplomats', 'early', 'Justin', 'Hayward', 'song', 'early', 'Moody', 'Blues', 'demo', 'early', 'history', 'bands', 'where', 'guys', 'came', 'Moody', 'Blues', 'may', 'have', 'value', 'serious', 'Moody', 'Blues', 'completists.On', 'documentary', 'do', 'get', 'lot', 'discussion', 'Mike', 'Pinder', 'Graeme', 'Edge', 'Denny', 'Laine', 'John', 'Lodge', 'Justin', 'Hayward', 'also', 'Ian', 'Anderson', 'Eric', 'Burdon', 'funny', 'know', 'Eric', 'Burdon', 'wore', 'wire', 'glasses', 'would', 'look', 'exactly', 'real-life', 'image', 'Grandpa', 'Simpson', 'TV', 'show', 'Simpsons', '.And', 'be', 'rather', 'strange', 'how', 'Patrick', 'Moraz', 'such', 'mystique', 'never', 'see', 'documentaries', 'Moody', 'Blues', 'even', 'Yes', 'Why', 'so', 'hard', 'get', 'hold', ""'d"", 'like', 'hear', 'personal', 'input', 'impressive', 'career.Most', 'people', 'may', 'just', 'want', 'rent', 'Moody', 'Blues', 'DVD', 'first', 'mean', 'lot', 'unnecessary', 'information', 'put', 'together', '3', 'disc', 'set', 'wish', 'were', 'just', 'released', 'single', 'DVD', 'just', 'Disc', 'One', 'cost', 'what', 'was', 'be', 'honest', 'still', 'think', 'Legend', 'Band', 'better', 'documentary', 'Moody', 'Blues', 'even', 'barely', 'Go', 'Now', 'days', 'only', 'covered', 'Moody', 'Blues', '1990', 'guess', ""n't"", 'hurt', 'own', 'more', 'casual', 'Moody', 'Blues', 'fan', 'may', 'be', 'more', 'satisfied', 'Legend', 'Band', 'documentary']",Moody Blues: Classic Artists

1050359,A6VXZ1EEPRTLV,B000MRAAJ2,trebe,"[2, 2]","For anyone really interested in the Moody Blues, this 153 minute long documentary released in 2006 hits many of the significant events in the band's history.  Largely consisting of interviews with members of the band, and those with connected with the music industry, the documentary provides a wealth of information.  It begins with teenage boys in Birmingham, England, discovering a love for music, and forming their own band, and then following the events that led to the formation of what would eventually become the Moody Blues, one of the groundbreaking progressive rock bands of the 1960's and 1970's.Listening to the various interviews, what's amazing is the depth and clarity of the memories that most involved have, of events that took place over forty years ago!  The tone is mostly warm and positive, although there is some bitterness when the band recounts how they were ripped off by their ""management"", and never received the royalties for their first hit Go Now.  Another fascinating aspect, is the tightness of the musical community in Britain at the time, as the Moodies once toured  with The Beatles, and also hung out with The Rolling Stones, and The Animals.One of the key events in the band's early history was the departure of Denny Laine, and the reformation of the Moodies with bass player John Lodge and guitarist Justin Hayward.  This lineup's first album was the masterpiece,Days Of Future Passed(1967), a landmark recording in history of progressive rock.  On the strength of this majestic effort, the band had found their signature sound, and then entered their remarkably productive golden period (1967-72), when they produced an amazing string of seven hit albums.Interestingly, the band takes credit for popularizing the gatefold type album sleeve, and seeking more creative control, in 1969 they formed Threshold Records a subsidiary of Decca Records.  The assertion that the band found that it had over relieved on overdubbing, is quite remarkable.  As a result, the band streamlined their sound forA Question Of Balance(1970),Every Good Boy Deserves Favour(1971), andSeventh Sojourn(1972) albums, focusing on creating music that they could reproduce live.  The documentary devotes very little time to these recordings, or this time period.The Moodies went on hiatus in 1974, as some of the members did solo projects, and Hayward scored a hit with Forever Autumn.  Reforming in 1977, the recording of the album Octave proved to be a difficult experience, as Mike Pinder drifted away from the group.  As they Moodies were preparing to tour, Pinder unexpectedly declined to participate, creating hard feelings that apparently still run quite deep.  Pinder eventually left the band, and though it is not mentioned, apparently took legal action against the remaining members.Time is devoted to the band's major lineup changes, as ex-Yes keyboardist Patrick Moraz who replaced Pinder, and Moraz in turn was replaced by keyboardist Bias Boshell.  According to drummer Graeme Edge, in the late 80's he began to feel that he did not have the energy to play at full strength throughout an entire live performance.  This led to the addition of a second drummer in 1991 for their live shows.  Apparently due to health concerns, Roy Thomas retired in 2003.  The band replaced him with classically trained flautist Norda Mullen, a Mississippi native.  Interestingly, Jethro Tull's Ian Anderson is featured expressing interest in the possibility of replacing Thomas.After floundering for a while, the band experienced resurgence in popularity in the mid 80's.  Although the band's days of mega-stardom had clearly past, the Moodies have a solid fan base, and continue to tour and occasionally record.  A major event was the 1992 concert at Red Rock, which featured the band playing songs from Days Of Future Past, accompanied by an orchestra.  This supposedly one-time event, led to the band performing with an orchestra for some years.  The documentary closes with the thought that the Moodies will remain viable, as long as John Lodge, Justin Hayward, and Graeme Edge, continue to be the heart of the band.Classic Artists may a bit uneven, giving in depth coverage to some less significant subjects, while kind of glossing over other seemingly more significant events.  The documentary doesn't sugarcoat certain sensitive  subjects, such as the band's lack of respect in the UK press, or falling away from the cutting edge of music.  Producer Tony Clarke's contributions were so critical to the band's sound, that he was regarded as the ""sixth Moodie"", and recovering from his departure, was another major hurdle for the band to overcome.  Unfortunately, not much is heard from Ray Thomas, and perhaps to compensate for this, Mike Pinder who left in the 70's, seems to get as much or more face time than Lodge, Edge, or Hayward.  Besides footage from music videos, there seems to be few actual clips of live performances, prior to the 1990's.  Overall, the documentary still contains a wealth of information, and is well worth seeing, for the huge number of interview clips.",5,a remarkably informative retrospective of the
