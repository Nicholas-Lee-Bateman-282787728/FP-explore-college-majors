1496315,AAZRWLML88IZK,B005OJCI0C,A kids review,"[1, 11]","Much has been made of Saddam Hussein's multiple doppelgangers, who the notorious dictator used to stay one step ahead of those who might capture -- or kill -- him. Based on factual events, The Devil's Double focuses on the same phenomenon as it applied to one of Hussein's sons, Uday Hussein. Dominic Cooper here plays dual roles as both Latif Yahia, the Iraqi lieutenant chosen as Uday's double, and Uday himself; as Latif discovers the depths of Uday's dark and psychotic behavior, he must come to terms with what he's been asked to do in Uday's name. I was fairly split about The Devil's Double, though I liked Cooper's dedication to the role. Directed by Lee Tamahori and co-starring Ludivine Sagnier, Philip Quast, and Latif Yahia himself in a supporting role, I balked at The Devil's Double's graphic portrayal of Uday Hussein's cruel and sadistic nature, but am willing to recognize the strength of Cooper's performance.",1,The Devil's Double,1323475200,"12 10, 2011",2011,927,"['Much', 'been', 'made', 'Saddam', 'Hussein', 'multiple', 'doppelgangers', 'who', 'notorious', 'dictator', 'used', 'stay', 'one', 'step', 'ahead', 'who', 'might', 'capture', 'kill', 'Based', 'factual', 'events', 'Devil', 'Double', 'focuses', 'same', 'phenomenon', 'applied', 'one', 'Hussein', 'sons', 'Uday', 'Hussein', 'Dominic', 'Cooper', 'here', 'dual', 'roles', 'Latif', 'Yahia', 'Iraqi', 'lieutenant', 'chosen', 'Uday', 'double', 'Uday', 'Latif', 'depths', 'Uday', 'dark', 'psychotic', 'behavior', 'must', 'come', 'terms', 'what', 'been', 'asked', 'do', 'Uday', 'name', 'was', 'fairly', 'split', 'Devil', 'Double', 'liked', 'Cooper', 'dedication', 'role', 'Directed', 'Lee', 'Tamahori', 'co-starring', 'Ludivine', 'Sagnier', 'Philip', 'Quast', 'Latif', 'Yahia', 'supporting', 'role', 'balked', 'Devil', 'Double', 'graphic', 'portrayal', 'Uday', 'Hussein', 'cruel', 'sadistic', 'nature', 'am', 'willing', 'recognize', 'strength', 'Cooper', 'performance']",N/A

He effectively plays three roles: Uday Hussein; Latif Yahia, the Iraqi subject pressed into duty as Hussein's double; and Yahia-as-Hussein, a role which calls on Cooper to pretend his Iraqi Average Joe has transformed into a monster.  How Cooper didn't get an Oscar nomination for this performance is beyond me.Dreadfully miscast here: Ludivine Sangier - known simply as 'The Body' in her native France, she deserves better than what she's been handed here.

The plot was excellent, built around a classic suspense script turning an ordinary man into a good-guy Hollywood hero. Actually, not only a hero, but the real Bruce Willis clich&eacute; type of a hero. The sad part, which none of the other reviwers seem to acknowledge, is that it's so painfully obvious not based on much truth. The story is just way too much Hollywood with probably no other sources than Yahias own. I would not bet any money whatsoever that even 10% of what happened on the screen is based on any real events. It didn't surprise me when I searched for Yahais story on the net and found that his account has been questioned by journalists from Guardian and BBC, and probably many others.

Charlize of course deservedly won all 3 major awards (Golden Globe, SAG & Oscar) for best actress, while Faye was snubbed by the Academy - apparently she was hated for her guts portraying the evil Crawford so well.

I could easily list several dozen other negative adjectives to describe Uday - in fact the film triggered me to refresh my memory on the difference between a sociopath and a psychopath.  Because Saddam ran Iraq with an iron fist and placed himself and his family far above the law and the people, Uday had carte blanche to indulge every whim that entered his warped mind.  It would be hard to pick the most horrific event from the many shown in the movie.Besides reenacting Uday's many crimes against humanity and the people of Iraq, TDD attempts to delve into the physical and psychological means by which Uday and his father exercise their power over others and get them to tolerate and abet their criminal behavior.  The main subjects here are an Uday lookalike coerced into becoming a double of Uday, and Uday's primary mistress.  The film makers did merely an adequate job in this aspect; they did not make this viewer break out into a cold sweat, as would have been expected if they had succeeded in placing the viewer into the minds of the victims.TDD is a star vehicle for Dominic Cooper, who portrays both Uday and Uday's double.  His Uday is especially good - a true unrestrained lunatic - and he provides a strong contrast in emotion when portraying Uday's double.  All the other roles in the movie are much smaller by comparison, including Ludivine Sagnier as Uday's primary mistress.  Sagnier turns in a fine performance in her English speaking role, but I have to admit that she is even more appealing when speaking French.Watch TDD if you want to see what can happen when a country is run by a family of gangsters.",4,Good riddance to the Husseins of Iraq,1356912000,"12 31, 2012",2012,1899,"['even', 'tenth', 'events', 'portrayed', 'Devil', 'Double', 'TDD', 'are', 'true', 'then', 'one', 'can', 'conclude', 'world', 'better', 'place', 'Uday', 'Hussein', 'father', 'Saddam', 'power', 'Iraq.The', 'focus', 'TDD', 'Saddam', 'hedonistic', 'amoral', 'sadistic', 'insane', 'son', 'Uday', 'could', 'easily', 'list', 'several', 'dozen', 'other', 'negative', 'adjectives', 'describe', 'Uday', 'fact', 'film', 'triggered', 'refresh', 'memory', 'difference', 'sociopath', 'psychopath', 'Saddam', 'ran', 'Iraq', 'iron', 'fist', 'placed', 'family', 'far', 'law', 'people', 'Uday', 'had', 'carte', 'blanche', 'indulge', 'whim', 'entered', 'warped', 'mind', 'would', 'be', 'hard', 'pick', 'most', 'horrific', 'event', 'many', 'shown', 'movie.Besides', 'reenacting', 'Uday', 'many', 'crimes', 'humanity', 'people', 'Iraq', 'TDD', 'delve', 'physical', 'psychological', 'means', 'Uday', 'father', 'exercise', 'power', 'others', 'get', 'tolerate', 'abet', 'criminal', 'behavior', 'main', 'subjects', 'here', 'are', 'Uday', 'lookalike', 'coerced', 'becoming', 'double', 'Uday', 'Uday', 'primary', 'mistress', 'film', 'makers', 'did', 'merely', 'adequate', 'job', 'aspect', 'did', 'not', 'make', 'viewer', 'break', 'out', 'cold', 'sweat', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'expected', 'had', 'succeeded', 'placing', 'viewer', 'minds', 'victims.TDD', 'star', 'vehicle', 'Dominic', 'Cooper', 'who', 'Uday', 'Uday', 'double', 'Uday', 'especially', 'good', 'true', 'unrestrained', 'lunatic', 'strong', 'contrast', 'emotion', 'when', 'portraying', 'Uday', 'double', 'other', 'roles', 'movie', 'are', 'much', 'smaller', 'comparison', 'including', 'Ludivine', 'Sagnier', 'Uday', 'primary', 'mistress', 'Sagnier', 'fine', 'performance', 'English', 'speaking', 'role', 'have', 'admit', 'even', 'more', 'appealing', 'when', 'speaking', 'French.Watch', 'TDD', 'want', 'see', 'what', 'can', 'happen', 'when', 'country', 'run', 'family', 'gangsters']",N/A

Many prominent leaders have employed them, and it seems some secondary figures have done so as well.Here's the scoop. Saddam Hussein's son Uday is a dirt bag. Drugs, alcohol, an insatiable appetite for women (even underage ones) and murder are all part of his day to day. He figures he needs a double to divert possible assassination attempts from himself. He hires an old buddy, tweeks his looks a bit, and it's off to the races. The problem is that the guy he hires is a genuinely decent guy so the going is rough.This is a near great movie. Dominic Cooper plays both Uday and his double and does a really sweet job. Ludivine Sagnier plays one of Uday's reluctant girl toys who sees the goodness in his double and works to capitalize on it. I don't know how much they had to 'adjust' the original story for screen purposes, but I'm guessing the broad strokes are true. The whole thing comes to a rousing climax and gives the audience some much needed relief from an overwrought situation. The directing, music, editing and all the other aspects of production are all very professional. But what this has going for it at its core is a good script and great acting.

1496334,A328S9RN3U5M68,B005OJCI0C,Grady Harp,"[13, 14]","THE DEVIL'S DOUBLE is a surprise film - a film that is not only informative in that it is based on a true story, but it is also an examination of the corruption of Saddam Hussein's (Philip Quast) control of Iraq, AND it also happens to display one of the finest acting performances by a male actor this year.  Dominic Cooper is doubly exceptional playing both the man from whom the story was obtained - Latif Yahia - as well as the 'Black Devil' Uday Saddam Hussein, Saddam Hussein's despicably rotten, psychopathic, drug addicted, Lothario and brutal murderer oldest son.There is a term 'fiday' which means body double. According to encyclopedic sources `Uday Saddam Hussein is known to have used a body double named Latif Yahia. Being from a well-off family, Yahia was sent to the best school in Iraq, and it was at one of those that he first crossed paths with Uday. Even then, his resemblance to Uday was something that was apparent as Yahia's classmates would point out. Years later, during the Iran-Iraq war, Yahia was a captain on the front when he was pulled out by Iraqi intelligence and forced to become Uday's fiday or body double via threats to his family. Yahia was then made to undergo training and cosmetic surgery (including dental) in order for him to resemble Uday more. After allegedly surviving 11 assassination attempts targeted at Uday, Yahia successfully fled Iraq in December 1991. Uday had his father picked up and poisoned in retribution. Yahia wrote a book detailing his life and the life he lived as Uday's body double in his book The Devil's Double.'Baghdad, the playground for the rich and infamous, where anything can be bought - but for a price. This is Uday Saddam Hussein's world and with his depraved lust for debauchery and immorality, he helps himself to whatever turns him on. The film recreates Baghdad and the sordid conditions in the city as Iraq overtook Kuwait for its oil, and act that marked the beginning of the Iraqi war with the United States. Clips of Hussein  and Bush are inserted for credibility.  When Latif is forced by torture and threats to become Uday's double  the tension mounts to an almost incredible level.  When Latif can no longer stomach the barbarianism of Uday he flees with Uday's No. 1 mistress Sarrab (Ludivine Sangier) to Malta: Latif's protection of Sarrab is compromised and Latif returns, betrayed, to Baghdad to cause bodily harm to Uday.The brilliance of this film is focused on the dual roles Dominic Cooper plays - Latif and Uday - two men as opposite from each other as could be imagined.  But Cooper is able to pull this duplicity of roles off so well that it at all times seems like there are two actors playing the individual roles.  It is a true tour de force of acting and should place Dominic Cooper in the lineup for the Oscars.  It is not clear why this film is not better known.  It is magnificently written (Latif Yahia and Michael Thomas),  filmed (Sam McCurdy) and directed (Lee Tamahori) and in this reviewer's opinion deserves to be considered one of the best films of the year. It is that powerful: it is that deserving.

Dominic Cooper is dressed in gold with a gold background and his holding two rifles. Even his skin is gold. A bank heist movie? A gangster movie? I was surprised that THE DEVIL'S DOUBLE refers to Uday Hussein's body double in Iraq during the first gulf war.It's a story of excess, brutality and evil. Latif Yahia looks amazingly similar to Uday Hussein and is the perfect body double after some minor cosmetic adjustment. Latif is an honest soldier unprepared for his new life as ""the devil's double."" He enters a world of excess and abuse and Uday's offers him access to his world.

A few times, I wondered if there were two actors but it was Cooper. This fine and talented actor has a great future ahead of him. THE DEVIL'S DOUBLE is worth watching if only to see Dominic Cooper. It can get confusing as to which man is Latif and which one is Uday. Cooper usually but not always gives Uday a shrill, high-pitched voice.The big disappointment to me was finding out this movie ""based on a true story"" was mostly fictionalized. Yes, there is a real Latif Yahia who was Uday Hussein's body double. His book was the basis for the movie and he was an advisor. When I watched the extras, the director clearly stated he wanted to go with a fictionalized account of the true story. Uday's story was bizarre enough to keep the reality in.

The movie poster, alone, tells an amazing story beyond the often-misleading Hollywood blip we typically find in life-sized cardboard at the local multiplex.  Following suit with strong impressions, the film opens with actual stock footage of Saddam's grotesque war-mongering tyranny, and then transitions to a stunning Iraqi landscape with, arguably, the most beautifully crisp sunset I've seen in a movie.  The lighting is artistically harsh; deliberately over-yellowed and blaring...just like the grittiness of the story.There is little more story than the hook of the movie itself, and  I have to admit I didn't find it great, but somehow I was captivated!  Latif (Dominic Cooper; Captain America) is an Iraqi war hero with strong family values.  Uday (also played by Dominic Cooper) is a sociopath whose indulgences and small, impish laugh leave only suffering in his wake. Seeing Latif beside Uday, learning to emulate Uday, and coming to hate him while becoming all the more like him...very cool.The shots in this movie were crisp and made tactful motifing use of reflections in various manners.  The lighting, harsh yet beautiful, often yields indicative rays or glows hovering about our main characters as if to come just shy of haloing God's chosen of the House Saddam and their Godsend, Latif.  Amidst smart wardrobing and solid cinematography, the filmmakers have more tricks yet, catching me off guard with occasional scenes of brusque brutality alternatingly mitigated by oddly endearing scenes such as when Latif watches Saddam and his double enjoy a cool drink in between the games of their tennis match (against each other).The movie takes a telegraphed turn as Latif, forced and abused into his servitude all the while listening as it is called `love' and `honor', resists his ungrateful host.

Surrounding the life of Uday Hussein and his double, Latif Yahia, The Devil's Double packs in drama, thrills, and even some dark humor. This is one amazing film!What did I like? First, Dominic Cooper's performance as Uday/Latif is stunning: he plays a sinister Uday and an honorable Latif. His performance is one of the best I've seen in a long time and it definitely should've won awards. The rest of the acting was also great. The story was immersive and interesting. It's beautifully shot. I also enjoyed the music. It's brutal and powerful; this movie will stay with me for a while.What did I dislike? I thought it had a very abrupt ending, it could've been a bit more fulfilling. That's only a minor issue, though. I also felt like if lost some of its steam towards the end, so the pacing was a little off; another very minor issues.Overall, I highly recommend The Devil's Double. If you're still not sure, it's available on Netflix Streaming as of 7/15/12, but it's definitely worth a purchase.

However, at the end of the actual action, I was presented with a scene that appeared to be complete fiction. So, what I saw overall was a good film, but rather confusing in its point. Further the director said he wanted to dig to find out how Saddam Hussein and his wife created such evil as Uday and Qusay, the same idea which drew me to this film in the first place.  I kept waiting for some small revelation of how's and why's here, but found none.  Instead, Uday is presented as a rather one-dimensional, completely repulsive character, lacking any humanity or any redeeming qualities.  Perhaps he was truly like that, but he also likely had more facets than we see in this film.Nevertheless, at the heart of the film is the relationship between Uday and his body double, both played absolutely brilliantly by Dominic Cooper.  The interviews with both Dominic Cooper and the real Latif in the extras were absolutely fascinating.There is a lot of graphic violence and sadistic behavior, but I think the director did a great job of restraint in portraying examples of some of Uday's reprehensible acts. The viewer gets it without being abused by the images.Ultimately, this will be one of those movies I have to watch a few times to mine all of what the storyteller is trying to tell me.

The writers of this movie seem to think that portraying one of the most ruthless personas of our era (Saddam's useless son) as a whiny annoying temper tantrum throwing idiot was a charming idea. Well, it isn't. It was a horrendous idea! Not to say he wasn't like that, but the lead actor in this movie did not pull it off worth squat. It was painful to view, in all honesty. And I've never seen so many so-called Iraqis played by white people. What the!? And I thought there was Muslims over there. Why in the world would the writers have so many of players in this movie refer to God. Again and again, God. Wouldn't Allah have been more appropriate. And the little romantic love triangle was trite and boring.

None of them are positive.The Devil's Double is a ""take no prisoners"" film that's as hard to watch as it is entertaining. It follows Latif Yahia (Dominic Cooper), an Iraqi soldier from an upper class family, who is plucked from the war to act as Uday's double. Uday (also played by Cooper), remembers the comparisons the two would get when they jointly attended grade school. He asks Yahia to be his double - for both political and personal reasons. Like his father, Uday is in a constant state of worry over an assassination attempt. Further, he wants to send Yahia on personal trips that he himself doesn't wish to attend. Yahia, kind and warm, refuses, but is forced to with the threat of harm to his family. Yahia is given cosmetic surgery and dentures to complete the look.Yahia is thrust into Uday's world. This is a world filled with rape, torture, murder, drugs, sex and money. The lifestyle that the Hussein's live is more than Presidential - it is royal. Immediately, Uday claims Yahia as his own property. Uday has grown into a monster, getting whatever he wants and never having to deal with the consequences. Yahia is who he wants. The atrocities he witnesses because of Uday disgust him, but he is stuck in this nightmare. We watch as Uday preys upon young girls walking home from school. We watch as he guts his father's best friend at a party. We watch Yahia struggle with the lifestyle he is forced to live. Uday's fascination with Yahia grows stronger and it enters your mind that Uday may actually be in love with his double. This doesn't necessarily mean in a romantic way, but because his love of himself is so great, that he sees Yahia as apart of himself.While the rest, as they say, is history, I certainly don't want to spoil the way the rest of the film plays out. This is a movie that you must see for yourself!The acting in dual roles by Cooper, his first film as lead, is Oscar worthy. He gives both men their own voices, mannerisms and idiosyncrasies, that instantly allow the viewer to tell them apart. Subdued and stoic, Cooper plays Yahia as a guilt ridden man, grappling with the life he has been thrust into. He plays Uday as a manic, hyper madman with a broken smile and a creepy laugh. You literally believe they are two different actors.Latif is an ordinary man who is thrust into an extraordinary situation. An object of admiration for the President's son, he has no choice but to comply with the excruciating horrors that are put forth before him. Never once, however, do we seem his morals waver.We know how it ends, but as with life, it's the journey that's important. The Devil's Double is the real life, Middle Eastern Scarface.

I'd seen him in a few things (such as THE DUCHESS), but he wasn't really on my radar.  That has certainly changed after seeing him absolutely dominate THE DEVIL'S DOUBLE.  He plays dual roles as Uday Hussein, the unhinged, deeply dangerous son of Saddam Hussein, and Latif, the unlucky young man who happens to look almost exactly like the evil Uday.  Latif is forced to serve as Uday's double...the person who gets to go out in public pretending to be Uday and running the risk of assassination.As such, Cooper gets to go wild & crazy as Uday...a man utterly ruled by his own perversions and volatility.  He has almost ultimate power in the Iraq depicted here...the years of the Iraq/Iran War, the first Gulf War and the years after.  There is little that is subtle about this depiction of Uday.  Unlike, for example, the depiction of Idi Amin in THE LAST KING OF SCOTLAND...we don't really see any ""soft"" side or ""reasonable"" side to Uday...he's all uncontrolled id.  His drunken, coke-fueled parties and his forays into the streets of Baghdad in order to find young schoolgirls to force himself on show us a man who literally has no redeeming values.  Cooper chews into this with gusto.But as Latif, he shows quiet strength.  Latif becomes more and more sickened by what he sees around him.  Uday, to Latif's chagrin, seems to have taken a liking for him and thus tries to drag him into his debauchery.  Latif resists, but cannot help but become an angry shell of his former self.  Cooper shows this character transition very believably.THE DEVIL'S DOUBLE, as directed by Lee Tamahori, is not a subtle movie.  It is not really trying to make any global statements nor is it shrouded with a deeper meaning.  It's a straight-forward story of these two men, and some of the men and women in their circles.  It feels a bit exploitative...but is undeniably gripping.  There's something compelling about seeing just how low the human psyche can sink.  Tamahori directs with the kind of gusto Cooper brings to his Uday...over-the-top & a bit loud.  It's seems appropriate, but it also prevents the movie from being truly great.  (I'm not sure there is a GREAT movie to be found here...Uday is not a character full of internal conflict...he could easily be a villain in a bad spy movie.)  A few scenes of Uday's corruptness feel a bit repetitive, and for much of the movie, all Latif can do is endure.  There's little forward momentum, per se, but rather a series of set pieces.  A romance is developed between Latif and one of Uday's favorite women (played by French actress Ludivine Sagnier)...but it doesn't resonate too much.  Also, because this is a true story...the spot where the film ends is of necessity a bit anti-climactic.Nonetheless, there is plenty to enjoy in Cooper's performance (and the most amazing ""split-screen"" work I've ever seen...I totally forgot that Cooper is having to act with himself in so many scenes).  This is not a film for the faint of heart, but it is luridly gripping.  If it sounds interesting to you, I would recommend it...but if it sounds like the subject matter is just a turn-off, I can't imagine you enjoying the film.  I give it a positive rating based on its energy and its star-making lead performance (or make that performances).",4,Lurid but featuring a great lead performance,1352592000,"11 11, 2012",2012,3351,"['Dominic', 'Cooper', 'not', 'actor', 'who', 'had', 'ever', 'made', 'much', 'impression', ""'d"", 'seen', 'few', 'things', 'such', 'THE', 'DUCHESS', 'was', ""n't"", 'really', 'radar', 'certainly', 'changed', 'seeing', 'absolutely', 'dominate', 'THE', 'DEVIL', 'DOUBLE', 'dual', 'roles', 'Uday', 'Hussein', 'unhinged', 'deeply', 'dangerous', 'son', 'Saddam', 'Hussein', 'Latif', 'unlucky', 'young', 'man', 'who', 'look', 'almost', 'exactly', 'evil', 'Uday', 'Latif', 'forced', 'serve', 'Uday', 'double', 'person', 'who', 'go', 'out', 'public', 'pretending', 'be', 'Uday', 'running', 'risk', 'assassination.As', 'such', 'Cooper', 'go', 'wild', 'crazy', 'Uday', 'man', 'utterly', 'ruled', 'own', 'perversions', 'volatility', 'almost', 'ultimate', 'power', 'Iraq', 'depicted', 'here', 'years', 'Iraq/Iran', 'War', 'first', 'Gulf', 'War', 'years', 'little', 'subtle', 'depiction', 'Uday', 'Unlike', 'example', 'depiction', 'Idi', 'Amin', 'THE', 'LAST', 'KING', 'OF', 'SCOTLAND', 'do', ""n't"", 'really', 'see', 'soft', 'side', 'reasonable', 'side', 'Uday', 'uncontrolled', 'id', 'drunken', 'coke-fueled', 'parties', 'forays', 'streets', 'Baghdad', 'order', 'find', 'young', 'schoolgirls', 'force', 'show', 'man', 'who', 'literally', 'redeeming', 'values', 'Cooper', 'gusto.But', 'Latif', 'quiet', 'strength', 'Latif', 'more', 'more', 'sickened', 'what', 'Uday', 'Latif', 'chagrin', 'have', 'taken', 'liking', 'thus', 'tries', 'drag', 'debauchery', 'Latif', 'can', 'not', 'help', 'become', 'angry', 'shell', 'former', 'self', 'Cooper', 'character', 'transition', 'very', 'believably.THE', 'DEVIL', 'DOUBLE', 'directed', 'Lee', 'Tamahori', 'not', 'subtle', 'movie', 'not', 'really', 'trying', 'make', 'global', 'statements', 'shrouded', 'deeper', 'meaning', 'straight-forward', 'story', 'two', 'men', 'men', 'women', 'circles', 'bit', 'exploitative', 'undeniably', 'gripping', 'something', 'compelling', 'seeing', 'just', 'how', 'low', 'human', 'psyche', 'can', 'sink', 'Tamahori', 'kind', 'gusto', 'Cooper', 'Uday', 'over-the-top', 'bit', 'loud', 'appropriate', 'also', 'movie', 'being', 'truly', 'great', ""'m"", 'not', 'sure', 'GREAT', 'movie', 'be', 'found', 'here', 'Uday', 'not', 'character', 'full', 'internal', 'conflict', 'could', 'easily', 'be', 'villain', 'bad', 'spy', 'movie', 'few', 'scenes', 'Uday', 'corruptness', 'feel', 'bit', 'repetitive', 'much', 'movie', 'Latif', 'can', 'do', 'endure', 'little', 'forward', 'momentum', 'se', 'rather', 'series', 'set', 'pieces', 'romance', 'developed', 'Latif', 'one', 'Uday', 'favorite', 'women', 'played', 'French', 'actress', 'Ludivine', 'Sagnier', ""n't"", 'resonate', 'too', 'much', 'Also', 'true', 'story', 'spot', 'where', 'film', 'necessity', 'bit', 'anti-climactic.Nonetheless', 'plenty', 'enjoy', 'Cooper', 'performance', 'most', 'amazing', 'split-screen', 'work', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'seen', 'totally', 'forgot', 'Cooper', 'having', 'act', 'so', 'many', 'scenes', 'not', 'film', 'faint', 'heart', 'luridly', 'gripping', 'interesting', 'would', 'recommend', 'subject', 'matter', 'just', 'turn-off', 'ca', ""n't"", 'imagine', 'enjoying', 'film', 'give', 'positive', 'rating', 'based', 'energy', 'star-making', 'lead', 'performance', 'make', 'performances']",N/A

1496372,A1CLUR3JCYO0TQ,B005OJCI0C,stevie,"[1, 1]","Picked this up last night from redbox. I never knew a whole lot about Uday other than he was apparently super evil and even disliked by Saddam Husein even. Ouch. So I was really excited to watch this and it stays interesting the whole time. The story is told through the body double chosen/forced by Uday. The man's name is Latif. Despite focusing the story on Latif, Uday almost feels like the main character as well because you observe Uday's life through Latif. Dominic Cooper plays both characters and they do a great job making them look similar yet different at the same time. Mostly, Latif is always looking disgusted and upset by Udays actions while Uday is a loud mouth drunkard and all around sinophile. Nevertheless, they did a good job. Latif undergoes some minor surgery to look more like Uday which is why Latif was picked to begin with.This movie has a lot of shocking moments. I wondered how much of it was true and what was added for drama. After some research, I found that most of the brutality sequences were true including the main ones. Some were the same story but possibly altered and I think some were altered but contained the main theme. The most surprising scene that was actually true except for the setting was a scene where Uday stabs and cuts open Saddams food taster in a public party. In real life, Uday used an electric carving knife, but in both mediums, Uday cut the mans stomach open.....In real life, they were honoring the wife of Hosni Mubarak at a party. The setting was unclear in the movie, but they demonstrate the viciousness clearly. Some characters were added that did't really make any sense, specifically the main female character. She's one of Udays lady friends who becomes attached to Latif. Her role is probably totally false, but I imagine she is there to further add insight into the insanity of Latif and add an unnecessary sex scene later on. I thought this cheapened the movie as well as a scene later when Uday ordered everyone to take off their clothes in a club, even the men. Why was this there? I'm guessing Uday could have done this. However, these moments kept the movie from being a five star rating. I found myself wanting to know more about Udays motives and how he got the way he was. How much power did Uday really have in the government? Why did Saddam give Uday so much free reign? What was their relationship? The real questions are never answered and some of the more interesting stories are never included. For example, in real life, Uday had lions and took many home videos of himself. He had a car collection of over a 100 cars. Uday also had the iraqi soccer team tortured when they lost and beaten. Some of these points are hinted at in the movie, but never developed. At the end, I felt like I wanted this to be a 3 hour special on history channel or national geographic rather than a hollywood movie with fake scenes added for dramatic effect. Its just surprising considering how much material they actually had to work with, that they did not make it as close to true as possible. Not to mention, the whole story may be entirely made up.[...]It appears that the real Latif has caused serious doubt among the press for years regarding his story. Apparently, he never mentioned his adventure to anyone until after he was married......Another reason why I wish this was a documentary. Hollywood never tries to find the real story.Lastly, this movie is full of offensive material. Some of the worst for R rating.

Uday decides that, like his father, he needs a body double to protect himself from those who'd like to kill him. Soldier and former classmate of Uday, Latif Yahia, is picked for the job. When Latif initially declines, it is made more than clear that the offer is not a request. It's a life or death choice.Based in the true story of Latif, ""The Devil's Double"" is a tale of what unchecked wealth, greed and sexual averice can happen when the safety mechanisims are taken away. Uday had a taste for fast cars and young women, and he discarded them equally when he tired of them. Latif finds that even those close to Uday are wary and cautious of Saddam's son's appetites and savage behavior. The longer Latif remains ensnared by a man who announces at one point, ""God doesn't give me anything, I take what I want,"" the more he falls into desperation. Which means that if Uday wants to watch videos of the men he's tortured and killed (graphically included in the film), he will and everyone around him will uneasily tolerate it. Latif knows he could be part of the next random cruelty...and likely will, eventually.The most amazing thing about ""The Devil's Double,"" aside from the bizarreness of the true story, is Dominic Cooper who plays Latif and Uday. Latif is troubled and fighting the person he's been forced to become, Uday is a raging id without conscious. Cooper digs into both roles with so much verve that it's tough to discern he is really playing both roles. Cooper heads up an international cast that includes Philip Quast in a surprisingly sympathetic portrayal of Saddam (and Saddam's double) and French actress Ludivine Sagnier as Sarrab, a troubled woman also caught between Uday and Latif.

These events surround the son of Saddam Hussein - Uday Hussein. When you are a bit of a tyrant or even just feckless and lazy, it is nice to have someone stand in for you on the odd occasion. That is where a `fiday' comes in handy, that is a double to be used to fill in on those boring diplomatic visits and be target practice for would be assassins.In real life this was a former school mate of Uday's one Latif Yahia). Both Uday and Latif are played brilliantly by Dominic Cooper, who actually steals the show with two bravura performances. Latif is picked up and given a choice of becoming the fida or face the consequences. Well he soon finds out what refusal means and so against his will starts to do the bidding of Uday. The house of Saddam is portrayed as a hedonistic hell hole, where everything, life included, is cheap; especially when you have so much oil revenue. Being in absolute power also leads inevitably to absolute corruption. The actual events are shown and real footage is used in places especially around the invasion of Kuwait and subsequent battles.  There is also the recreation of some of the `parties' and the music is all `Dead or Alive' or Frankie Goes to Hollywood a nice juxtapoint to the on screen antics.There are scenes of torture and some quite bloody and visceral violence as well as some unpleasant sexual scenes. This however is more a study of a psychotic child who only grew up long enough to learn to drive, fire a gun, have non consensual sex and be able to stick things up his nose rather than a gore fest. Uday is portrayed as a thoroughly unlikable chap with not one iota of a saving grace. There is also a fair smattering of profanity, but it is not gratuitous based on the events being depicted as anyone would be hard pushed not to let fly with the odd cuss word or twoThis is not an enjoyable film, it is however a very good one. Whilst it is trying to tell a story that actually happened, it is still a form of entertainment and as such you just know that some poetic licence has been used; that aside it is still a powerful and gripping piece of cinema and is a show case for the abilities of Dominic Cooper.

This is the true story of Latif Yahia (Cooper) and how he was hand picked by Uday Hussein (Cooper) to be his body double. Latif is stuck in the middle of becoming someone he hates and getting killed by saying no. This is another type of movie that will not get the audience that it deserves. Cooper, who plays a duel role, give quite possibly the year's best acting performance and is deserving of at least an Oscar nomination. Playing both the egotistical, sex-crazed, evil Uday and the poor, family oriented good guy Latif. The performance of the two polar opposites are so great that you sometimes forget it's the same person even when they are in the same scene. This is a very emotional movie, and even though you know how it will end you keep waiting for something bad to happen to Uday while pulling for Latif to be free. The acting all around is fantastic and the movie is a must see. This is a movie that is almost impossible to not have strong feelings of hatred toward Uday, and it brings back all the feelings you had while this reign was still in power.

1496379,A6VXZ1EEPRTLV,B005OJCI0C,trebe,"[2, 2]","Lee Tamahori's The Devil's Double (2011) is docudrama based on the controversial claims of Latif Yahia, a former Iraqi soldier, who says that in the late 1980's he was forced to become a double for Uday Saddam Hussein, the oldest son of Saddam Hussein, the military dictator of Iraq.  With some remarkable insights into the despotic Hussein regime, the film presents a shocking image of a man, corrupted by power, often driven by lust, who employed violence and terror to satisfy his needs.  After the fall of Saddam Hussein, Uday Hussein was killed by American forces in 2003.  He was 38 years old.Dominic Cooper gives an impressive performance in dual roles, as both Uday Hussein and Latif Yahia.  Because of his resemblance to Hussein, Yahia a former classmate is chosen to be a ""fedai"", or double for Hussein.  Yahia's job is to stand in for Hussein in dangerous situations.  He initially refuses, but to insure the safety of his family, he eventually agrees.Referring to him as his ""brother"", Uday Hussein makes Yahia a part of his world, which includes alcohol, drugs, clubbing, parties, fast cars, and lots of women.  Yahia studies Hussein's mannerisms and speech patterns, and even receives the blessing of Saddam Hussein (Philip Quast) himself.  While impersonating Uday, Yahia is almost killed in an assassination attempt.Known for abusing women, Hussein cruises the streets in a convertible, calling out to schoolgirls.  In one incident, a girl is abducted on the street, and taken to a party where an enraged Hussein butchers an army officer with a knife.  The girl is given drugs, and her corpse is later dumped in the desert.  In another instance, Hussein is attending a wedding at a hotel and takes a fancy to the bride.  He rapes the woman, who then commits suicide by diving off the balcony, her shattered body landing at the feet of her new husband.With his family at risk, Yahia is trapped by circumstances, but as time goes on he becomes more resistant to Hussein's wishes.  After a suicide attempt, Latif escapes from Iraq with one of Uday's kept women (Ludivine Sagnier).  This defiance has terrible repercussions for Yahia, who decides to strike back decisively at his enemy.Historically, Uday Hussein's reputation as a murderer, torturer, rapist, and abuser of human rights is well established.  While incorporating some factual events, albeit with embellishments for dramatic purposes, The Devil's Double is controversial, because there are some who dispute the claims that Uday Hussein ever employed a stand in.  While provocative and shocking, having such a key element in doubt, casts shadows of doubt over the film.Led by Dominic Cooper's powerful dual portrayal, the acting performances are very strong, touching many nerves.  Definitely not a pleasant experience, or ""kid safe"", but still enlightening to some extent, for those with the stomach for it, The Devil's Double is worth seeing, particularly while it is available to Prime members.",4,controversial tale of the eldest son of Saddam Hussein...,1350172800,"10 14, 2012",2012,2972,"['Lee', 'Tamahori', 'Devil', 'Double', '2011', 'docudrama', 'based', 'controversial', 'claims', 'Latif', 'Yahia', 'former', 'Iraqi', 'soldier', 'who', 'late', '1980', 'was', 'forced', 'become', 'double', 'Uday', 'Saddam', 'Hussein', 'oldest', 'son', 'Saddam', 'Hussein', 'military', 'dictator', 'Iraq', 'remarkable', 'insights', 'despotic', 'Hussein', 'regime', 'film', 'shocking', 'image', 'man', 'corrupted', 'power', 'often', 'driven', 'lust', 'who', 'employed', 'violence', 'terror', 'satisfy', 'needs', 'fall', 'Saddam', 'Hussein', 'Uday', 'Hussein', 'was', 'killed', 'American', 'forces', '2003', 'was', '38', 'years', 'old.Dominic', 'Cooper', 'impressive', 'performance', 'dual', 'roles', 'Uday', 'Hussein', 'Latif', 'Yahia', 'resemblance', 'Hussein', 'Yahia', 'former', 'classmate', 'chosen', 'be', 'fedai', 'double', 'Hussein', 'Yahia', 'job', 'stand', 'Hussein', 'dangerous', 'situations', 'initially', 'insure', 'safety', 'family', 'eventually', 'agrees.Referring', 'brother', 'Uday', 'Hussein', 'part', 'world', 'alcohol', 'drugs', 'clubbing', 'parties', 'fast', 'cars', 'lots', 'women', 'Yahia', 'studies', 'Hussein', 'mannerisms', 'speech', 'patterns', 'even', 'blessing', 'Saddam', 'Hussein', 'Philip', 'Quast', 'impersonating', 'Uday', 'Yahia', 'almost', 'killed', 'assassination', 'attempt.Known', 'abusing', 'women', 'Hussein', 'streets', 'convertible', 'calling', 'out', 'schoolgirls', 'one', 'incident', 'girl', 'abducted', 'street', 'taken', 'party', 'where', 'enraged', 'Hussein', 'butchers', 'army', 'officer', 'knife', 'girl', 'given', 'drugs', 'corpse', 'later', 'dumped', 'desert', 'instance', 'Hussein', 'attending', 'wedding', 'hotel', 'fancy', 'bride', 'woman', 'who', 'then', 'suicide', 'diving', 'off', 'balcony', 'shattered', 'body', 'landing', 'feet', 'new', 'husband.With', 'family', 'risk', 'Yahia', 'trapped', 'circumstances', 'time', 'more', 'resistant', 'Hussein', 'wishes', 'suicide', 'attempt', 'Latif', 'Iraq', 'one', 'Uday', 'kept', 'women', 'Ludivine', 'Sagnier', 'defiance', 'terrible', 'repercussions', 'Yahia', 'who', 'strike', 'back', 'decisively', 'enemy.Historically', 'Uday', 'Hussein', 'reputation', 'murderer', 'torturer', 'rapist', 'abuser', 'human', 'rights', 'well', 'established', 'incorporating', 'factual', 'events', 'embellishments', 'dramatic', 'purposes', 'Devil', 'Double', 'controversial', 'are', 'who', 'dispute', 'claims', 'Uday', 'Hussein', 'ever', 'employed', 'stand', 'provocative', 'shocking', 'having', 'key', 'element', 'doubt', 'shadows', 'doubt', 'film.Led', 'Dominic', 'Cooper', 'powerful', 'dual', 'portrayal', 'acting', 'performances', 'are', 'very', 'strong', 'touching', 'many', 'nerves', 'Definitely', 'not', 'pleasant', 'experience', 'kid', 'safe', 'still', 'enlightening', 'extent', 'stomach', 'Devil', 'Double', 'worth', 'seeing', 'particularly', 'available', 'Prime', 'members']",N/A
1496380,ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T,B005OJCI0C,Tsuyoshi,"[2, 5]","During the Iran-Iraq War, Latif Yahia (on whose memoirs the film is based) was summoned to the palace of Saddam Hussein, where Uday Hussein, elder son of the Iraq's president awaits him, assigning Latif, an army lieutenant with a striking resemblance with Uday, to do a job for him - a job that Latif knows he cannot refuse. He is to become a body double for sadistic Uday. This means not only danger and uncertainty; his new life also means long (and probably permanent) separation from his family waiting for him at home.I do not know to what extent the film's content is based on truth, but the film's premise is certainly intriguing. Sadly, director Lee Tamahori, whose recent works include ""Next"" (just OK) and ""xXx: State of the Union"" (terrible), just doesn't know how to tell the story, which could have been more fascinating. Details of the atrocities committed by Uday are credible (and horrifying), but the story of Latif trying to maintain his sanity as ""The Devil's Double"" lacks substance and is told poorly, dependent on melodramatic twists and turns involving Sarrab (Ludivine Sagnier, wasted), Uday's girlfriend to whom Latif is romantically attracted.Probably ""The Devil's Double"" will be remembered for the stunning performances of Dominic Cooper (""The History Boys"" and perhaps better known as Howard Stark of ""Captain America: The First Avenger"") playing double role of Latif and Uday.
