When I first started watching it, the graphics (for the overall animation) made me think that I rented a stinker.  But I went along with it, since low budgets usually don't turn me off.  It started interesting at first, with a slight storyiline going on (old man on a walker goes through a city doghing/killing zombies and worms, searching for shoes, while a giant zombie army heads towards the already infested city).  It got more boring as it went along, reusing the same exact combat animations (which were cool at first, but you get tired of it after seeing the same thing 5 times, then it keeps growing to the hundreds range), which involved the old guy either bashing their brains in, or twisting their heads off using the walker (it sounds cool, but trust me, it will get boring after the first few times).  In the end, the story goes nowhere, especially after the old geezer turns into a zombie.  The film then focuses on a few individuals who eventually die (pointless), a small military group coming in to blast the zombies (we don't see them die; they seem like the only ones who will live), and finally another old guy getting killed, with the zombie geezer moaning over it, then taking a small bite.  The film ends there.The film starts to get very very boring during and after the bridge battle between the old guy and the zombies (that's where the repetetiveness really starts to show).  Even then, I'll be impressed if anyone makes it that far into the movie.Bottom line, avoid the movie.  Very boring.  It took me willpower to get through this one.",1,Painfully repetetive.,1197331200,"12 11, 2007",2007,1655,"['SPOILERS', 'AHEAD', 'spotted', 'Hollywood', 'video', 'concept', 'sounded', 'interesting', 'When', 'first', 'started', 'watching', 'graphics', 'overall', 'animation', 'made', 'think', 'rented', 'stinker', 'went', 'low', 'budgets', 'usually', 'do', ""n't"", 'turn', 'off', 'started', 'interesting', 'first', 'slight', 'storyiline', 'going', 'old', 'man', 'walker', 'city', 'doghing/killing', 'zombies', 'worms', 'searching', 'shoes', 'giant', 'zombie', 'army', 'heads', 'already', 'infested', 'city', 'got', 'more', 'boring', 'went', 'along', 'reusing', 'same', 'exact', 'combat', 'animations', 'were', 'cool', 'first', 'get', 'tired', 'seeing', 'same', 'thing', '5', 'times', 'then', 'growing', 'hundreds', 'range', 'involved', 'old', 'guy', 'bashing', 'brains', 'twisting', 'heads', 'using', 'walker', 'cool', 'will', 'get', 'boring', 'first', 'few', 'times', 'end', 'story', 'nowhere', 'especially', 'old', 'geezer', 'zombie', 'film', 'then', 'few', 'individuals', 'who', 'eventually', 'die', 'pointless', 'small', 'military', 'group', 'coming', 'blast', 'zombies', 'do', ""n't"", 'see', 'die', 'seem', 'only', 'ones', 'who', 'will', 'live', 'finally', 'old', 'guy', 'getting', 'killed', 'zombie', 'geezer', 'moaning', 'then', 'taking', 'small', 'bite', 'film', 'there.The', 'film', 'get', 'very', 'very', 'boring', 'bridge', 'battle', 'old', 'guy', 'zombies', 'where', 'repetetiveness', 'really', 'show', 'Even', 'then', ""'ll"", 'be', 'impressed', 'anyone', 'far', 'movie.Bottom', 'line', 'avoid', 'movie', 'Very', 'boring', 'took', 'willpower', 'get', 'one']",N/A
998741,A11XKY4EIU2KNR,B000G5R97Q,"Johny Bottom ""Insane and lonely guitarist""","[0, 0]","OK, so what we have here is a zombie cartoon movie done with Southpark style animation. The characters, humans and zombies alike walk as if theire legs were scissor blades. The legs never cross one in front of the other, they just scissor kick their way around the city.The reason the world is infested with zombies is because of a parasitic worm that lives in the water. It gets into your bloodstream and takes over 95% of your brain. Thus you become a flesh eating zombie.Fred is our main character. He is a senile old man who talks to his walker which talks back. After he momentarily loses his walker, he discovers it has actually been his shoe that has been talking to him the whole time just 'pretending' to be the walker. Now Fred is no wuss, he probably kills at least 500 zombies with his walker and various firearms. Other human characters include an ample bussomed nurse, a fat gun-toting weirdo, and an old man with an antidote.Now halfway through the movie Fred becomes a zombie. Before he becomes a zombie the boredom sets in even with a high body count number on the bridge scene. To be honest after he becomes a zombie the movie prety much goes down hill, he stops talking which was 90% of the dialouge and humor in the first place.This movie is good enough to watch once, but you will find yourself patiently waiting for the ending. I cannot imagine anyone buying this and watching it more than once.",2,Good enough to watch once..... barely,1199577600,"01 6, 2008",2008,1417,"['OK', 'what', 'have', 'here', 'zombie', 'cartoon', 'movie', 'done', 'Southpark', 'style', 'animation', 'characters', 'humans', 'zombies', 'alike', 'walk', 'theire', 'legs', 'were', 'scissor', 'blades', 'legs', 'never', 'cross', 'one', 'front', 'other', 'just', 'scissor', 'kick', 'way', 'city.The', 'reason', 'world', 'infested', 'zombies', 'parasitic', 'worm', 'water', 'bloodstream', 'over', '95', '%', 'brain', 'Thus', 'become', 'flesh', 'eating', 'zombie.Fred', 'main', 'character', 'senile', 'old', 'man', 'who', 'walker', 'back', 'momentarily', 'walker', 'actually', 'been', 'shoe', 'been', 'talking', 'whole', 'time', 'just', ""'pretending"", 'be', 'walker', 'Now', 'Fred', 'wuss', 'probably', 'least', '500', 'zombies', 'walker', 'various', 'firearms', 'Other', 'human', 'characters', 'include', 'ample', 'bussomed', 'nurse', 'fat', 'gun-toting', 'weirdo', 'old', 'man', 'antidote.Now', 'halfway', 'movie', 'Fred', 'zombie', 'zombie', 'boredom', 'sets', 'even', 'high', 'body', 'count', 'number', 'bridge', 'scene', 'be', 'honest', 'zombie', 'movie', 'prety', 'much', 'down', 'hill', 'talking', 'was', '90', '%', 'dialouge', 'humor', 'first', 'place.This', 'movie', 'good', 'enough', 'watch', 'once', 'will', 'find', 'patiently', 'waiting', 'ending', 'can', 'not', 'imagine', 'anyone', 'buying', 'watching', 'more', 'once']",N/A

Second thing, the Amazon price on this at the moment is $26.99, i paid $15 for it but i still feel ripped off.Even with an excessive amount of gore, it doesn't break past crappy animation and absolutely no story line whatsoever.

998743,A2JFKSHR0WQB8C,B000G5R97Q,QuickSilverSeven,"[8, 10]","This is an animated zombie movie (not many of those) with loads of bloody gore about an old guy beating the ""living dead"" out of zombies every chance he gets. Seems like 3/4 of this cartoon is just a stream of nonstop zombie deaths and zombies eating. Characters pretty much serve the purpose of being lunch for the dead, being ripped apart left and right in a blood drenched display.The story reminds me of the anime Vampirehunter D, but instead of a talking hand, he's got a talking walker to dispatch the dead with. Sure an old guy's not as cool, but he makes up for it with his actions. The plot is slim, as City of Rott clearly puts the zombie-action first. The animation could've been better and there are slow parts, but the serious gore level makes up for it.

998744,A2EDZH51XHFA9B,B000G5R97Q,"Robert Beveridge ""xterminal""","[2, 2]","City of Rott (Frank Sudol, 2006)I'll warn you up front: in order to explain my rating of this movie, it's going to have to spoil the major plot twist. Therefore, if you have any intention of seeing this movie, I warn you: stop reading RIGHT NOW.Okay, now that everyone else is gone, the first thing to note: I was unaware (presumably, if you're considering buying it, you are not) that City of Rott is an animated movie. Yes, folks, cartoon zombies. How cool is that? Well, kind of. But it does get repetitive after a while. Fred, our main character, dodges zombies, kills zombies, meets other survivors, watches them get killed, dodges zombies, kills zombies... you get the idea.Where this movie could have made a right turn to greatness was halfway through. Exactly halfway through. You see the pivotal scene, and you ask yourself ""okay, this movie's only halfway over, what are we going to do for the next forty minutes?"" The answer... we follow Fred around as a zombie. Now, I'm not one hundred percent certain about this, but I'm relatively sure no zombie movie made to date has followed its main character around both as a living creature and as a zombie. The very concept is brilliant. Unfortunately, Sudol-- who's pretty good at making shorts-- is not the guy to do it in a full-length movie. The Fred-as-zombie half of the movie quickly becomes as repetitive as the first half, and we're pretty much back to square one.But someone needs to take this concept and run with it, and Sudol gets serious points for coming up with the idea in the first place. ** ",3,"Fantastic idea, but the execution is a little off.",1178841600,"05 11, 2007",2007,1565,"['City', 'Rott', 'Frank', 'Sudol', '2006', ""'ll"", 'warn', 'up', 'front', 'order', 'explain', 'rating', 'movie', 'going', 'have', 'spoil', 'major', 'plot', 'twist', 'Therefore', 'have', 'intention', 'seeing', 'movie', 'warn', 'stop', 'reading', 'RIGHT', 'NOW.Okay', 'now', 'everyone', 'else', 'gone', 'first', 'thing', 'note', 'was', 'unaware', 'presumably', ""'re"", 'considering', 'buying', 'are', 'not', 'City', 'Rott', 'animated', 'movie', 'Yes', 'folks', 'cartoon', 'zombies', 'How', 'cool', 'Well', 'kind', 'get', 'repetitive', 'while', 'Fred', 'main', 'character', 'zombies', 'kills', 'zombies', 'other', 'survivors', 'watches', 'get', 'killed', 'zombies', 'kills', 'zombies', 'get', 'idea.Where', 'movie', 'could', 'have', 'made', 'right', 'turn', 'greatness', 'was', 'halfway', 'Exactly', 'halfway', 'see', 'pivotal', 'scene', 'ask', 'okay', 'movie', 'only', 'halfway', 'what', 'are', 'going', 'do', 'next', 'forty', 'minutes', 'answer', 'follow', 'Fred', 'zombie', 'Now', ""'m"", 'not', 'one', 'hundred', 'percent', 'certain', ""'m"", 'relatively', 'sure', 'zombie', 'movie', 'made', 'date', 'followed', 'main', 'character', 'around', 'living', 'creature', 'zombie', 'very', 'concept', 'brilliant', 'Unfortunately', 'Sudol', 'who', 'pretty', 'good', 'making', 'shorts', 'not', 'guy', 'do', 'full-length', 'movie', 'Fred-as-zombie', 'half', 'movie', 'quickly', 'as', 'repetitive', 'first', 'half', ""'re"", 'pretty', 'much', 'back', 'square', 'one.But', 'someone', 'take', 'concept', 'run', 'Sudol', 'serious', 'points', 'coming', 'up', 'idea', 'first', 'place', '**']",N/A

There are all sorts of hints about the symbolism, too many in fact. I liked Fred listening to his walker to survive. It had that ""Boy and His Dog"" appeal going for it, but alas the walker wasn't really talking, it was the worms feeding off Fred's brain (more symbolism).
