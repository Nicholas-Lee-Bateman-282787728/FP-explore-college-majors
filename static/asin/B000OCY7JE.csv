1063290,A3EE0H0NWQ9QVL,B000OCY7JE,"&#34;Rocky Raccoon&#34; ""Hey, Doc, It's Only ...","[43, 47]","`After the Wedding,' Denmark's ""Best Foreign Picture"" nominee for the Academy Awards has a lot going for it.  Even if there is a soap opera feel to the scenes and the story, the quality is head and shoulders above any serial.  Not to mention the fact we get six months of development in one movie.  Solid performances, and camera shots that capture every revealing reaction give the story a magnetic interest.The film begins in India where Jacob Pedersen (Mads Mikkelson) works with the impoverished.  He feels at home with the children, but he goes back to Denmark to raise funds for the orphanage and get reacquainted with his family.  At home his former love Helene (Sidse Babett Knudsen) has married a tycoon, Jorgen Hanson (Rolf Lassgard), someone Jacob is able to solicit funding with ease.  Once they meet, he is invited to their daughter's wedding.  Much like `Rumor Has It' with far less laughs, yet more substantive development, Jacob finds out at the reception that he has more at stake at home than he previously thought.  From there he is reattached to deceptive Helene, and both must sort out the bitter resentment they feel for one another.  (Did he have one affair as he says or was he the philanderer by her account?)  Toasting her mother and step-father at the wedding, the bride Anna (Stine Fischer Christensen) later comes to grip with life-changing information in her own life.Skillfully sorting out the relationships and priorities of the key players, `After the Wedding,' presents a bitter-sweet story with memorable characters and interesting circumstances.  One of the merits of the film is how it defines poverty in India and compares it with a different kind of impoverishment for the wealthy.  Jorgan's problems wouldn`t make us trade places with him for the world.  Similarly, one of the boys at the orphanage reminds Jacob that he doesn't even like the wealthy.  Another ironically says, ""If I were rich, I'd be happy.""  Watching everyone come to grips with their lives and barter for stability make `After the Wedding` a revealing family portrait.",4,"""Can't Buy Me Love""",1179100800,"05 14, 2007",2007,2078,"['Wedding', 'Denmark', 'Best', 'Foreign', 'Picture', 'nominee', 'Academy', 'Awards', 'lot', 'going', 'Even', 'soap', 'opera', 'feel', 'scenes', 'story', 'quality', 'head', 'shoulders', 'serial', 'Not', 'mention', 'fact', 'get', 'six', 'months', 'development', 'one', 'movie', 'Solid', 'performances', 'camera', 'shots', 'capture', 'revealing', 'reaction', 'give', 'story', 'magnetic', 'interest.The', 'film', 'India', 'where', 'Jacob', 'Pedersen', 'Mads', 'Mikkelson', 'impoverished', 'home', 'children', 'back', 'Denmark', 'raise', 'funds', 'orphanage', 'get', 'reacquainted', 'family', 'home', 'former', 'love', 'Helene', 'Sidse', 'Babett', 'Knudsen', 'married', 'tycoon', 'Jorgen', 'Hanson', 'Rolf', 'Lassgard', 'someone', 'Jacob', 'able', 'solicit', 'funding', 'ease', 'Once', 'meet', 'invited', 'daughter', 'wedding', 'Much', 'Rumor', 'far', 'less', 'laughs', 'yet', 'more', 'substantive', 'development', 'Jacob', 'out', 'reception', 'more', 'stake', 'home', 'previously', 'thought', 'reattached', 'deceptive', 'Helene', 'must', 'sort', 'out', 'bitter', 'resentment', 'feel', 'one', 'Did', 'have', 'one', 'affair', 'was', 'philanderer', 'account', 'Toasting', 'mother', 'step-father', 'wedding', 'bride', 'Anna', 'Stine', 'Fischer', 'Christensen', 'later', 'grip', 'life-changing', 'information', 'own', 'life.Skillfully', 'sorting', 'out', 'relationships', 'priorities', 'key', 'players', 'Wedding', 'bitter-sweet', 'story', 'memorable', 'characters', 'interesting', 'circumstances', 'One', 'merits', 'film', 'how', 'poverty', 'India', 'different', 'kind', 'impoverishment', 'wealthy', 'Jorgan', 'problems', 'wouldn', 't', 'make', 'trade', 'places', 'world', 'Similarly', 'one', 'boys', 'orphanage', 'Jacob', ""n't"", 'even', 'wealthy', 'ironically', 'were', 'rich', ""'d"", 'be', 'happy', 'Watching', 'everyone', 'come', 'grips', 'lives', 'barter', 'stability', 'make', 'Wedding', 'revealing', 'family', 'portrait']",After the Wedding

But, I came across it in the ""A"" section of the library and picked it up.  I was glad I did; otherwise I would have missed out on such a wonderful and beautiful drama.  It's not really a love story, it's a commitment to life, love for a family, and on one side, a deep love for children whose only family is the orphanage.The film draws you in slowly, first by its beauty from the happy faces at the orphanage, to the wealthy land and mansion of the super wealthy.  The story moves, guides you, takes you on a journey, has you thinking about the plot, and slowly, you are drawn into the reality.With over two hours, it will keep you interested, wondering, deciding, and here see how a great storyline makes you think, accept, respond, only to offer something new to dwell on.Jacob Peterson, manager of an orphanage in India is summoned to Denmark to become a recipient of a monetary reward that will save the orphanage from financial ruin.  As he arrives in the midst of a wedding, he discovers that conditions come with the gift.Anna, an old flame is married to the multi-millionaire now, raising a beautiful young daughter who wedding is taking place.This is my first Susanne Bier film, characters were believable; storyline impressive, and the actors have done the characters justice.

1063293,A10UGG54QNH71L,B000OCY7JE,"Alex S ""Blurb""","[7, 13]","The infamous Danish director Susanne Bier has established herself as the so-called queen of piercing relationship melodramas (bordering on soap-operas), filmed in a style reminiscent of Dogme (natural lights, handheld DV cameras), only with a script and a soundtrack. Her ""Open Hearts"" dealt with the consequences of physical paralysis, and what that does to a blossoming relationship. ""Brothers"" told a story of two, um, brothers, one of them back from torn Afghanistan, competing for the affection of a beautiful woman (Connie Nielsen).Bier's poignancy, the immediacy that carry her films, and the truthful dialogue that resonates have, so far, overshadowed her over-reliance on close-ups of the protagonists' eyes, insistent sentimentality, and a pessimistic tone that can frankly be a major downer. Bier's US feature debut, ""Things We Lost in the Fire"", got criticized for an overexuberance of those latter qualities. Though ""After the Wedding"" is a stark and powerful drama, it also suffers from an unremittingly dismal tone. It seems as if Bier, instead of infusing her films with a much-needed sense of humor and love for life, has delved even deeper into the sadness and wretchedness that people can inflict upon each other.Jacob (Mads Mikkelsen) works in an orphanage in India. It faces closure due to financial issues, so he goes back to Danemark to ask for a grant from multi-millionaire Jorgen (Rolf Lassgard). Jorgen immediately begins to play mind games with Jacob, telling him he will ""consider"" him as one of the main contenders for the million-dollar grant, but needs a few days to think it over. Since Jacob has nothing to do, Jorgen invites him to his daughter's wedding. Jacob arrives, suspecting nothing. And then he recognizes Jorgen's wife...From this point on, the film goes into plot complications that I will not divulge. I will say one thing - it's all downhill. As lies are unmasked, and old secrets surface, things only get worse.Granted, ""After the Wedding"" is a class act. It's assured, mature filmmaking, with a clear sense of purpose. The acting is beautiful throughout - it really is hard to pinpoint a stand-out, everyone's so good - as is the script, the film's deliberately slowly unfolding plot  gradually revealing its many mysteries. But the film is also claustrophobically depressing, with barely any humor relief from all the drama. There's even a clumsily added (seemingly last-minute) sub-plot involving the daughter and her new husband's infidelity, which seems wholly unnecessary, apart from adding even more weight to an already weighty drama.As for the film's Dogme-like style, its pretentiousness distracts from the plot in some crucial spots as much as it entices you to watch in others. I'm a big fan of Dogme films, but here, after the 100th aforementioned lingering close-up of someone's eyes, artistry is toying with self-parody, and that's not a good thing for a film in which the inter-weaving of style has to be seamless.So, while better written, directed and acted than the majority of Hollywood dramas, ""After the Wedding"" will not appeal to those who try to avoid depression-trip movies. In typical Bier fashion, it raises a lot of questions of love, death, the choices that we make and their consequences, and only provides answers to some, while leaving the rest for our deliberation. Maybe it's time for the director to attempt a new approach; she can remain an auteur but try a different genre, for example. As it is, ""After the Wedding"" is competent: powerful but unoriginal.And depressing.

The cinematography and editing are 7 stars on a scale of 5.Mads Mikkelsen (Casina Royale) gives us a show stopping, honest performance. He is tapped by countless international productions for his incredible skill and unique overall persona/image. He is an actor who carries his weight on screen. He is this man he portrays. His actions and movement on screen are incredible. He acts without words.Rolf Lassgrd (Swedish Wallander Movies) blew me away with his portrayal of Jrgen Lennart Hannson, a Swede tycoon in Denmark. For me, I love the Swedish actor, speaking Swedish against one of its two sister languages Danish. It is something enjoyable to me for reasons I cannot explain here. This role was far from what I have seen him portray. He nailed it.Sidse Babett Knudsen also threw down in this work of art. Stine Fischer Christensen proved that she is a young actress worthy of her European acclaim. Stine steals our hearts and the later part of the film with a tear jerker scene.Susanne Bier is a master artist. I understand why Hollywood called on her for ""Things We Lost in the Fire"", a film which has her touch, on a smaller scale. I felt that Halle Berry was the weak link as an actor. Also Fire was missing something.I was not happy with a development later in the film. The development makes the story tick.

1063297,ANCOMAI0I7LVG,B000OCY7JE,Andrew Ellington,"[2, 2]","I truly respect director Susanne Bier for not conforming to the types of films society often embraces but actually really working to create something that feels real and pure within her work.  Even in her English speaking film `Things We Lost in the Fire' she never shied away from presenting the audience with something uncomfortable if she knew it was `real'.Of all her work, I feel that `Efter Brylluppet' is her best.We all know the term `misery loves company' and if you've read my reviews long enough to know the types of films I often indulge you'd know that that phrase can be applied to my preferred entertainment choice.  I love a film that can move me to tears and tear me down because it produces something real in me; a real emotional connection to the material.  Thus, the film becomes something so much more than just `entertainment'; it becomes a part of my soul.  `Efter Brylluppet' is not that depressing but it does produce something in me, something raw and unforgettable.  The film filters through so many emotions on screen and it elicits so many emotions off screen.  It's such a well rounded emotional rollercoaster and I love that about it.  You can feel something for every character, but what makes this movie so amazing is that you feel so many different things about each character.  There is no designated villain, no designated hero, no designated victim.  Everyone is all of the above at one time or another and thus each and every character becomes so much more than just a `character', they become human.The film tells the story of Jacob, a man working in an orphanage in Bombay.  When funds run low and he becomes desperate he travels to Copenhagen to meet with a wealthy man offering to `consider' his orphanage for a large donation.  The catch is that he must stay and attend the man's daughter's wedding.  It turns out that this man, Jorgen, is married to Jacob's ex-girlfriend Helene who happens to have bore her daughter, Anna, out of wedlock.  If you aren't following then I'll put it a little blunter.It appears that Jacob may actually be Anna's father.This is the immediate surprise, but it is not the only one, in this masterfully crafted weep fest by Bier.  Each character has so much to say, and each and every word seems to help complete and or flesh out the person next to them.  Each person is so connected and reliant on those around them.`Efter Brylluppet' exposes the beautiful side of human connection; trust me.The acting here is also outstanding from everyone involved.  Mads Mikkelsen is wonderfully controlled as Jacob, allowing his eyes to expose what his character is always trying to conceal.  I also really loved what Rolf Lassgard did with the character of Jorgen.  He takes this man and creates someone who appears one thing, so mysterious and someone guarded, and exposes his secret in such a desperate and crushingly realistic way.  It's a beautiful (and heartbreaking) transformation.  As great as the two men are, Sidse Babett Knudsen is even better.  As Helene, she really has to carry a lot of the emotional weight of the film (it was her cross to bear) and she does so with such raw connection and flawless control.Such a stunning performance.So, to bring us back to my initial statement, about `misery loving company' and all that.  The reason I brought that up is because, as some of you know, I love films that embellish the miseries in life.  I often find that a films `happy ending' is a falsity and that it takes away from the gritty realities I like to see in my cinema.

It is a very intriguing story, starting out with a man running an orphanage in India. This quickly establishes the main character as someone you can admire and someone to root for throughout the movie. I first saw the main character, played by Mads Mikkelsen, in the movie Casino Royale (2006). He did a great job being the villain in that movie, and I can safely say I have a whole new level of respect for him. Not only does he speak a totally different language in this movie, but he is about as dynamic of a character as they come. You can feel how he feels being at the wedding, realizing that the &#34;daughter&#34; of the man giving her away at the wedding is actually his daughter. You sympathize with him being away from the orphanage and trying to build a bond with his newly discovered daughter at the same time. I'm not going to give away the plot, but this movie will keep you interested from beginning to end. It has a heavy dose of drama comparable to Legends Of The Fall (another one of my favorite movies). Some would call it melodramatic, but given the situations the characters are dealing with they do an extraordinary job and it is still realistic.I would consider this a &#34;light&#34; rated R movie. There is some bad language, although it was probably only a few steps away from a PG-13 in that department. There is a little bit of sexuality in the movie, but it doesn't contain any long scenes of it.Bottom line: This is a fantastic movie that has a ton to offer.

1063313,A3J5UO5QMTFSWB,B000OCY7JE,"Connoisseur Rat ""armchair experientialist""","[46, 51]","Early on in Susanne Bier's Oscar Nominated (Best Foreign Film 2006) film ""After The Wedding"", Danish expat-in-India Jacob (the solid Mads Mikkelsen) is faced with the prospect of reluctantly returning to his homeland after twenty years to meet with a mysterious man who is offering the necessary funding to keep his school/orphanage open.  When explaining to Pramod (his adopted son-of-sorts) that he must leave, the precocious eight year old asks about the wealth of people in Denmark and finally concludes, ""If I was rich, I'd be happy.""Soon after, when we delve deeply into the lives of the proposed benefactor and his family, we see that this proclamation certainly does not apply to all people.  Or, at the very least, it definitely does not apply to billionaire Jorgen (the authoritative Rolf Lassgard) or his family.Although it seems like it might at first.  The jump from the teeming Indian squalor to the lush green Danish countryside almost jarringly illustrates the contrast of cultures (and that contrast is definitely underscored by patriarch Jorgen blasting ""It's Raining Men"" in his SUV); the disparity between the Third World and the First World is indeed extreme (the difference is Two Worlds, by the way - I did the math).  It's quite comical to see Jacob, upon arrival, trying to adjust to the cushy confines of the hotel where Jorgen houses him, as he can't figure out how to work the electronic amenities.When Jacob finally meets with Jorgen, his pitch is given short shrift by the busy billionaire: ""We're through,"" Jorgen says impatiently, leaving Jacob's presentation video mostly unseen.  But he still leaves the donational door a bit ajar as he invites him to his daughter's wedding, where Jacob could get some more face time.  This seems like a good plan at first, as Jacob has nothing else to do while in town, but revelations at the ensuing reception reveal that all is not as it seems.  Indeed, when newly-betrothed bride Anna (played by perky Stine Fischer Christensen) rises to make an unconventional speech and says, ""Mom's waiting for something to go horribly wrong,"" well it turns out that Mom (aka Helene) (Sidse Babett Knudsen, in a deeply-layered performance) doesn't have to wait long, and all of their lives are soon turned upside-down.As an unabashed fan of Scandinavian cinema, I had high expectations for this film, and it didn't disappoint in most respects.  The crisp, naturalistic cinematography and unapologetic (although occasionally a bit melodramatic) exploration of emotions is all to be expected.  Also always welcome are the sardonic, dry lines of humor and the quirky characters (such as online gambler Grandma, who - according to Helene - is senile ""only when she wants to be"" and is mostly seen complaining about her laptop's wireless internet reception).A couple of aspects of this film didn't quite work for me, however.  First, I found the multitude (maybe between 20-30 close-ups) of shots of single eyes was a bit overdone and took me out of the narrative flow, without having enough of a symbolic upside.  Also, some of the scenes teetered just at the edge of being a bit too maudlin and soap-operatic, but I guess life sometimes does get that way, and the actors are never unconvincing.Finally, some of the tonal shifts were a bit too uneven in places, as the film careens from joy to sorrow in split-seconds that can be unnerving in such an otherwise slowly-paced film.  But about that pacing: others may complain that this film could have been a bit cut to a more streamlined length, but I personally love the lingering and the loitering that takes place in movies like this - I feel we get to know as much about the characters during their ""down time"" as we would when there's ""something happening.""Ultimately, I feel this film ends up being an evocative exploration of whether or not to to tell the truth, of when to tell the truth, and of how to tell the truth even when it's difficult. And telling the truth when it's difficult is something this movie is very good at doing.  Four stars.(p.s. I'm purposely not telling you who says this review's title quote because I don't want to spoil it for you.)",4,"""Do I Have to Live on the Other Side of the World to Get Your Help?""",1176595200,"04 15, 2007",2007,4169,"['Early', 'Susanne', 'Bier', 'Oscar', 'Nominated', 'Best', 'Foreign', 'Film', '2006', 'film', 'Wedding', 'Danish', 'expat-in-India', 'Jacob', 'solid', 'Mads', 'Mikkelsen', 'faced', 'prospect', 'reluctantly', 'returning', 'homeland', 'twenty', 'years', 'meet', 'mysterious', 'man', 'who', 'offering', 'necessary', 'funding', 'keep', 'school/orphanage', 'open', 'When', 'explaining', 'Pramod', 'adopted', 'son-of-sorts', 'must', 'leave', 'precocious', 'eight', 'year', 'old', 'wealth', 'people', 'Denmark', 'finally', 'concludes', 'was', 'rich', ""'d"", 'be', 'happy', 'Soon', 'when', 'delve', 'deeply', 'lives', 'proposed', 'benefactor', 'family', 'see', 'proclamation', 'certainly', 'not', 'apply', 'people', 'very', 'least', 'definitely', 'not', 'apply', 'billionaire', 'Jorgen', 'authoritative', 'Rolf', 'Lassgard', 'family.Although', 'might', 'first', 'jump', 'teeming', 'Indian', 'squalor', 'lush', 'green', 'Danish', 'countryside', 'almost', 'jarringly', 'contrast', 'cultures', 'contrast', 'definitely', 'underscored', 'patriarch', 'Jorgen', 'blasting', 'Raining', 'Men', 'SUV', 'disparity', 'Third', 'World', 'First', 'World', 'indeed', 'extreme', 'difference', 'Two', 'Worlds', 'way', 'did', 'math', 'quite', 'comical', 'see', 'Jacob', 'arrival', 'trying', 'adjust', 'cushy', 'confines', 'hotel', 'where', 'Jorgen', 'houses', 'ca', ""n't"", 'figure', 'out', 'how', 'work', 'electronic', 'amenities.When', 'Jacob', 'finally', 'Jorgen', 'pitch', 'given', 'short', 'shrift', 'busy', 'billionaire', ""'re"", 'Jorgen', 'impatiently', 'leaving', 'Jacob', 'presentation', 'video', 'mostly', 'unseen', 'still', 'donational', 'door', 'bit', 'ajar', 'daughter', 'wedding', 'where', 'Jacob', 'could', 'get', 'more', 'face', 'time', 'good', 'plan', 'first', 'Jacob', 'nothing', 'else', 'do', 'town', 'revelations', 'ensuing', 'reception', 'reveal', 'not', 'Indeed', 'when', 'newly-betrothed', 'bride', 'Anna', 'played', 'perky', 'Stine', 'Fischer', 'Christensen', 'make', 'unconventional', 'speech', 'Mom', 'waiting', 'something', 'go', 'horribly', 'wrong', 'out', 'Mom', 'aka', 'Helene', 'Sidse', 'Babett', 'Knudsen', 'deeply-layered', 'performance', ""n't"", 'have', 'wait', 'long', 'lives', 'are', 'soon', 'turned', 'upside-down.As', 'unabashed', 'fan', 'Scandinavian', 'cinema', 'had', 'high', 'expectations', 'film', 'did', ""n't"", 'disappoint', 'most', 'respects', 'crisp', 'naturalistic', 'cinematography', 'unapologetic', 'occasionally', 'bit', 'melodramatic', 'exploration', 'emotions', 'be', 'expected', 'Also', 'always', 'are', 'sardonic', 'dry', 'lines', 'humor', 'quirky', 'characters', 'such', 'online', 'gambler', 'Grandma', 'who', 'according', 'Helene', 'senile', 'only', 'when', 'be', 'mostly', 'seen', 'complaining', 'laptop', 'wireless', 'internet', 'reception', 'couple', 'aspects', 'film', 'did', ""n't"", 'quite', 'work', 'however', 'First', 'found', 'multitude', 'maybe', '20-30', 'close-ups', 'shots', 'single', 'eyes', 'was', 'bit', 'overdone', 'took', 'narrative', 'flow', 'having', 'enough', 'symbolic', 'upside', 'Also', 'scenes', 'teetered', 'just', 'edge', 'being', 'bit', 'too', 'maudlin', 'soap-operatic', 'guess', 'life', 'sometimes', 'get', 'way', 'actors', 'are', 'never', 'unconvincing.Finally', 'tonal', 'shifts', 'were', 'bit', 'too', 'uneven', 'places', 'film', 'careens', 'joy', 'sorrow', 'split-seconds', 'can', 'be', 'unnerving', 'such', 'otherwise', 'slowly-paced', 'film', 'pacing', 'others', 'may', 'complain', 'film', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'bit', 'cut', 'more', 'streamlined', 'length', 'personally', 'love', 'lingering', 'loitering', 'place', 'movies', 'feel', 'get', 'know', 'as', 'much', 'characters', 'time', 'would', 'when', 'something', 'happening', 'Ultimately', 'feel', 'film', 'up', 'being', 'evocative', 'exploration', 'not', 'tell', 'truth', 'when', 'tell', 'truth', 'how', 'tell', 'truth', 'even', 'when', 'difficult', 'telling', 'truth', 'when', 'difficult', 'something', 'movie', 'very', 'good', 'doing', 'Four', 'stars.', 'p.s', ""'m"", 'purposely', 'not', 'telling', 'who', 'review', 'title', 'quote', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'spoil']",After the Wedding

He was too self-focused and abrasive.  As the movie starts, Jacob is working in an orphanage in India, but is called to Norway by a multi-millionaire, Jorgen, who says he will donate money to the orphanage. When Jacob meets with Jorgen, Jorgen procrastinates and says he is still considering and invites Jacob to attend his daughter's wedding the next day. At the wedding Jacob meets Jorgan's wife, whom he recognizes as someone he knew many years ago. And thus the story begins.This movie is superbly directed by Susanne Bier, who has directed several highly noted movies centering on how families behave during crisis situations, like ""Brothers"", about interactions between two brothers when one is sent to the war in Afghanistan, and ""In a Better World"" that won the 2011 Academy Award for best foreign film.After the wedding is subtle in some ways, obvious in others; but it will demand your attention and engage your emotions the whole way. I don't know if it will have you squirming in your seat, as one reviewer says, but he is correct when he says you will be unsettled.

What I found so touching was how essentially good almost all the characters were.The central character Jacob Pederson (Mads Mikkelsen) despite a nearly constant scowl on his face or a look of deep concern and perhaps worry is a man who really cares about right and wrong and other people. This is a sharp change from his misspent youth when all he cared about were...well what many of us cared about, having a good time. Now he runs an orphanage in Mumbai.While Jacob is the central character the most interesting character and the one with the biggest heart is the very rich Jorgen Lennart Hannson (Rolf Lassgard). Jacob has gone to Denmark to convince Jorgen to support his orphanage. It isn't clear that Jorgen will do so. He has choices for charity. But when Jorgen invites Jacob to his daughter's elaborate wedding, things change.I won't say any more about the plot since it is such an interesting and surprising plot. What I will say is that when Jorgen learns who Jacob really is in relationship to his family (and vice-versa!) he does something so caring, so surprising and so correct and so magnanimous that it will warm the cockles of the coldest heart and bring to tears the most cynical of viewers.And then we are back to Jacob and how he deals with what Jorgen has concocted. And he too does the right thing even though it completely changes his life and costs him something dear to his heart..I wish I could be more concrete. But see the film and I think you'll agree that this is the kind of movie that will make you feel good about people. It's a shame that it's rated ""R."" Perhaps if you have a tweener or even a bright 10-year-old you can watch it together. And you can talk about it. It is a great relationship film, and a great film for teaching young people about the real choices in life that can come upThe acting was excellent. Mikkelsen brought the strength of character and a justified pride to the role of Jacob while Lassgard was warm and real and smart as Jorgen. Both Sidse Babett Knudsen, who played Jorgen's wife, and Stine Fischer Christensen, who played the bride, were intense and so vivid I felt I could touch them. (The intense close-ups on the eyes and faces--and I mean intense--made the actors almost leap off the screen.)

Directed with panache by Susanne Bier, the result is really an involving soap opera given greater texture and surprising plot turns by Anders Thomas Jensen' dexterous screenplay. 2006 was obviously a fertile year for world cinema as this emotionally vibrant film competed against Guillermo del Toro's Gothic fairy talePan's Labyrinthand the winner, Florian Henckel von Donnersmarck's Cold War thrillerThe Lives of Others, for the 2006 Best Foreign Language Film Oscar.The story's protagonist is Jacob Peterson, a taciturn man dedicated to the orphanage he runs in India, so much so that coming back to Denmark holds little interest for him other than securing the funding he needs from a multinational corporation headquartered in Copenhagen. The seemingly avuncular CEO Jrgen Hansson just wants to shake Jacob's hand for his humanitarian work. When Jacob arrives, however, it becomes clear that Jrgen hasn't quite made up his mind about the gift much to Jacob's consternation. It seems like a good omen when Jrgen invites Jacob to his daughter Anna's lavish wedding at his palatial home, but then Jacob meets Jrgen's comely wife Helene, who turns out to have known Jacob years before. The story peels off one revelation after another, sometimes with subtlety and other times with the forceful contrivance of a sledgehammer. Each of the major story developments hinges on a secret that a principal character is forced to reveal, most often with devastating consequences.Looking a bit like Viggo Mortenson's recessive brother, Mads Mikkelsen (almost unrecognizable as the nasty banker Le Chiffre inCasino Royale) portrays Jacob with haunting power, though sometimes the character is presented too elliptically for Mikkelsen to flesh out effectively. For instance, we don't get a deep sense of his inner struggle over saving thousands of children in India since he lets his pride stand in the way when it becomes convenient to the plot. Rolf Lassgard manages to capture the bluster and increasing desperation of a man used to having his way but unable to cope with the inevitable. When his character's motivations are slowly revealed, his performance starts to unravel into excess, especially in a no-holds-barred breakdown scene toward the end. As the wife with the complicated past, Sidse Babett Knudsen is genuinely affecting, as is Stine Fischer Christensen as the waif-like daughter caught in the middle.Bier's idiosyncratic filmmaking style can be seen in the unexpected jump cuts and the heavy use of close-ups on the actors' eyes during the most tense and cathartic moments. The 2007 DVD is sparse on extras. Neither a commentary track nor a making-of featurette are included, but there is a reasonably insightful twenty-minute interview with Bier conducted by Danish film critic Morten Piil. Also included are the theatrical trailer and eight deleted scenes which Bier explains to Piil were cut because they either detracted from the main storyline or made a redundant plot point with little additional benefit. Looking at them after seeing the film, I would agree with her assessment. It's a very well crafted piece of work and certainly provides enough dramatic fireworks and moments of true insight to make this worthwhile viewing despite the occasional plot contrivance.",4,Surprising Revelations Drive a Powerfully Acted Contemporary Danish Melodrama,1199577600,"01 6, 2008",2008,3548,"['Danish', 'orphanage', 'worker', 'Mumbai', 'India', 'summoned', 'home', 'receive', 'large', 'donation', 'wealthy', 'industrialist', 'intensely', 'acted', '2006', 'drama', 'seamlessly', 'Douglas', 'Sirk', 'hyperbolic', 'melodramas', 'Ingmar', 'Bergman', 'more', 'austere', 'sensibilities', 'Directed', 'panache', 'Susanne', 'Bier', 'result', 'really', 'involving', 'soap', 'opera', 'given', 'greater', 'texture', 'surprising', 'plot', 'turns', 'Anders', 'Thomas', 'Jensen', 'dexterous', 'screenplay', '2006', 'was', 'obviously', 'fertile', 'year', 'world', 'cinema', 'emotionally', 'vibrant', 'film', 'competed', 'Guillermo', 'del', 'Toro', 'Gothic', 'fairy', 'talePan', 'Labyrinthand', 'winner', 'Florian', 'Henckel', 'von', 'Donnersmarck', 'Cold', 'War', 'thrillerThe', 'Lives', 'Others', '2006', 'Best', 'Foreign', 'Language', 'Film', 'Oscar.The', 'story', 'protagonist', 'Jacob', 'Peterson', 'taciturn', 'man', 'dedicated', 'orphanage', 'India', 'so', 'much', 'coming', 'back', 'Denmark', 'little', 'interest', 'other', 'securing', 'funding', 'multinational', 'corporation', 'headquartered', 'Copenhagen', 'seemingly', 'avuncular', 'CEO', 'Jrgen', 'Hansson', 'just', 'shake', 'Jacob', 'hand', 'humanitarian', 'work', 'When', 'Jacob', 'however', 'clear', 'Jrgen', ""n't"", 'quite', 'made', 'up', 'mind', 'gift', 'much', 'Jacob', 'consternation', 'good', 'omen', 'when', 'Jrgen', 'Jacob', 'daughter', 'Anna', 'lavish', 'wedding', 'palatial', 'home', 'then', 'Jacob', 'Jrgen', 'comely', 'wife', 'Helene', 'who', 'out', 'have', 'known', 'Jacob', 'years', 'before', 'story', 'peels', 'one', 'revelation', 'sometimes', 'subtlety', 'other', 'times', 'forceful', 'contrivance', 'sledgehammer', 'major', 'story', 'developments', 'secret', 'principal', 'character', 'forced', 'reveal', 'most', 'often', 'devastating', 'consequences.Looking', 'bit', 'Viggo', 'Mortenson', 'recessive', 'brother', 'Mads', 'Mikkelsen', 'almost', 'unrecognizable', 'nasty', 'banker', 'Le', 'Chiffre', 'inCasino', 'Royale', 'Jacob', 'haunting', 'power', 'sometimes', 'character', 'presented', 'too', 'elliptically', 'Mikkelsen', 'flesh', 'out', 'effectively', 'instance', 'do', ""n't"", 'get', 'deep', 'sense', 'inner', 'struggle', 'saving', 'thousands', 'children', 'India', 'pride', 'stand', 'way', 'when', 'convenient', 'plot', 'Rolf', 'Lassgard', 'capture', 'bluster', 'increasing', 'desperation', 'man', 'used', 'having', 'way', 'unable', 'cope', 'inevitable', 'When', 'character', 'motivations', 'are', 'slowly', 'revealed', 'performance', 'unravel', 'excess', 'especially', 'no-holds-barred', 'breakdown', 'scene', 'end', 'wife', 'complicated', 'past', 'Sidse', 'Babett', 'Knudsen', 'genuinely', 'affecting', 'Stine', 'Fischer', 'Christensen', 'waif-like', 'daughter', 'caught', 'middle.Bier', 'idiosyncratic', 'filmmaking', 'style', 'can', 'be', 'seen', 'unexpected', 'jump', 'cuts', 'heavy', 'use', 'close-ups', 'actors', 'eyes', 'most', 'tense', 'cathartic', 'moments', '2007', 'DVD', 'sparse', 'extras', 'commentary', 'track', 'making-of', 'featurette', 'are', 'included', 'reasonably', 'insightful', 'twenty-minute', 'interview', 'Bier', 'conducted', 'Danish', 'film', 'critic', 'Morten', 'Piil', 'Also', 'included', 'are', 'theatrical', 'trailer', 'eight', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'Bier', 'Piil', 'were', 'cut', 'either', 'detracted', 'main', 'storyline', 'made', 'redundant', 'plot', 'point', 'little', 'additional', 'benefit', 'Looking', 'seeing', 'film', 'would', 'agree', 'assessment', 'very', 'well', 'crafted', 'piece', 'work', 'certainly', 'enough', 'dramatic', 'fireworks', 'moments', 'true', 'insight', 'make', 'worthwhile', 'viewing', 'occasional', 'plot', 'contrivance']",After the Wedding

( Frequent camera panning on the eyes alone)  Jacob the newly discovered genetic father with paternal commitments in an Indian orphanage. The newly discovered daughter who moons over him despite 18yrs of happy bonding with a surrogate father of her own. Jacob who moons over her. Helen's the mother torn because the father shouldn't have told the daughter.. I don't have the time for these type of lost genetic re-unions as the catharsis strikes me as nothing more than self indulgent projection and wishful thinking. There is enough evidence that children deeply consider the parent/s they grew up with the real ones and the genetic one no more than a curiosity. Even the daughter switches back sides leaving Jacob looking like an anomalyThat said this an appealing film for people attracted by domestic/family dramas. Its well made scripted and acted and doesn't degenerate into soap opera.However Mads Mickkelsen sticks out like a very sore thumb as mis-cast in this film. There is no chemistry or likely compatability with the mother ever. He's a washed up loner who is reached by orphans. A lost soul who becomes a found soul if a lost orphan needs him. Once again I cant see he ever had a mutual attraction with Helene the staid pretty domestic goddess / mother in the film. Or the inherant emotional empathy to instantly bond with a girl-stranger despite a genetic dart.The plot re-casts him into an executive role which somehow cheers up the mis-casting but this role was made for a more daily looking guy who becomes transformed into superman by the executive role thrust upon him.Mythic in Valhalla Rising. Mean and dark in Casino Royale or Flame and Citroen. Its not a matter of being brainwashed by having him seen him cast in other roles.

If you automatically find sadness just a synonym for depression, you won't like it. Is it a melodrama? Perhaps, but it probes far deeper into the emotional cores of its four main characters than any melodrama I've seen since Bergman.Is it a pleasure to watch?

1063327,A328S9RN3U5M68,B000OCY7JE,Grady Harp,"[1, 2]","AFTER THE WEDDING ('Efter brylluppet') is a brilliant work, a two hour synthesis of life that demands our full attention and rewards that attention with some of the finest ensemble acting, directing, dialogue and message that we have come to expect from Danish writer/director Susanne Bier (Anders Thomas Jensen is also credited with the story concept). It is a film that raises difficult questions and situations and somehow pulls us into a world of damaged people about whom we genuinely care.Jacob (a stellar performance by Mads Mikkelsen) is a solitary soul who has found a niche in India as a teacher and caregiver in an orphanage. When he is informed that a wealthy donor is considering being a benefactor, Jacob leaves the children he loves to return to his native Denmark to the home of the potential donor Jrgen (another fine performance by Rolf Lassgrd) and his wife Helene (Sidse Babett Knudsen): in Jacob's past he had been lovers with Helene while both were in India). A major event is in the offing - the marriage of 20-year-old Anna - Stine Fischer Christensen - (Jrgen and Helene's daughter) and feisty Christian (Christian Tafdrup).  The only character who does not seem to have a secret is Jrgen's mother (Mona Malm) who suffers from mild dementia.  It should be a happy occasion, but after the wedding old wounds are uncovered, long secrets are discovered, and nothing is as it seems.  Jacob, now confronted with strange realities, longs to return to his Indian orphanage, but Jrgen manipulates his gift of money in a way that uncovers even more secrets. The multiple surprises that occur rapid fire keep the plot and character development spinning until the film closes with such grace that the audience is left stunned.As the current barrage of summer movies assault our senses, making us wonder about the mental hunger for films less than challenging, along comes the release of this magnificent work and reassures us that the era of superb cinema has not dissolved into cartoons.  AFTER THE WEDDING is a perfect as a film gets.  Highly recommended.

Beautifully filmed, knockout kids, excellent performances, and a glorious soundtrack brilliantly featuring Sigur Ros, the film looks, sounds, and feels spectacular. But it is thematically where it lost me, and lost me bad.I suppose we are to see contrasts between rich and poor, past and present. Money cannot buy everything. Yeah, OK, think we've heard that one before. But what this film is about is atonement. And it seems to say that money can indeed buy that. Jorgen wants to fund an orphanage to atone for his unnamed sins (unless the mere act of making money is a sin in itself.) 12 million dollars, even if they are depressed, buys a lot of hope for a lot of kids. Jorgen, apparently a truly and consistently good man in the world's eyes, is satisfied to do so. And garners praises. Jacob, sullied by a vile past, seeks atonement by serving the world's poor and desperate. Different path, same solution: works.But I don't think it is so easy. This is atonement for the non-religious, or karma-crowd. The good makes up for and outweighs the bad. Poof, all nasty stuff gone! Do a lot of bad, you had better do even more good to balance the scale. In a Denmark where the Protestant religion once flourished, but here plays no role other than officiating at weddings and funerals, this is the only moral scale to be found. But the old one, the one that says deeds cannot ameliorate what was done, seems far more true to me. Having characters scramble to fix their sins with actions, earning their way into (whatever--public acclaim, easy conscience, family respect, heaven...makes no difference) is the post-modern solution.

Good news: Jrgen, a philanthropist, wants to write the large check that will save it. On one condition: He wants to meet the recipient. The woman who runs the orphanage can't go.

It's not, after all, like he has anything else to do.At the wedding, the first surprise: Helene, Jrgen's wife, was once Jacob's lover. In fact, she was the lover who broke his heart. The lover who sent him scurrying off to India, an orphan hiding among orphans.Other surprises: I'll spare you. And encourage you to read not a word more about the story --- let the twists and turns sear you as they roll out. But I'll go this far: The rich and poor, the white and the colored, Europeans and Indians --- the moral lessons are so easy, aren't they? Or are they? Is Jacob's moral purity really an emblem of superiority? Is Jrgen's privileged life a sign of a rotting soul? You'll judge --- you can't help it --- but when it's over....When it's over, you'll want to thank director Susanne Bier, a Danish filmmaker whose last film, ""Brothers"", is also a memorably wrenching drama. Mads Mikkelsen --- who plays Jacob (and was the villain in ""Casino Royale"") --- will make you forget all other young actors; he's not only shockingly handsome, he can make reticence and distance both intimate and compelling. And Jrgen, played by Rolf Lassgrd --- when the film ends, you'll find yourself replaying his performance to take note of all that you missed. And was there ever a trophy wife as radiant, loving and thoughtful as Helene (Sidse Babett Knudsen)?""After the Wedding"" was Denmark's entry for Best Foreign Language Film at the 2007 Academy Awards. It lost to the German film, ""The Lives of Others."" I would have voted differently.There are DVDs you rent from Netflix. You watch them, you send them back; you got the amusement you paid for. But sometimes, very rarely, there are DVDs you buy. You buy them because you think they define a time in your life. Or because you think you'll want to watch them again. Or --- as is the case here --- because you want to press the film on someone you love and say, ""Here. This. A life-changer.""""After the Wedding"" took me to places I didn't know I could go to.

I'm so glad it was nominated for an Oscar, although I wonder why a flock of other international nominations did not also occur.  Mads Mikkelsen who gained recognition as the villain in the James Bond filmCasino Royale (2-Disc Widescreen Edition), does a good job with a tightly controlled performance as Jacob Peterson.  Peterson works in an orphanage in India and then must fly back to his home country of Denmark to seek funds.  Mikkelsen's good looks and powerful spats with Helene show him to be an actor with depth and range.  Rolf Lassgard's Jorgan is well played with a powerful scene toward the end of the film.  Jogan's wife Helene is played by Sidse Babette Knudsen who does an excellent job, making believable the woman in this situation.  Christian Tafdrup plays Christian, the groom at the wedding.  His good looks make him a good choice; and he shows his colors early on, which rapidly flare into his newlywed estrangement.  Stine Fischer Christensen plays Anna, the daughter who must adjust to several paternal adjustments as well as a marital one.  Neeral Mulchandani is charming as Pamrod who has been raised by Jacob in India.  The film sparkles, constantly moving and developing the story until it reaches its conclusion.

First I see the beautiful, mature and delightful Mira Nair film ""The Namesake"" (in my top twenty with a bullet) - and now this peach! What's going on!!""After The Wedding"" has a central performance from Mads Mikkelsen (the facially scared card-playing Le Chiffre in the superb ""Casino Royale"") that is both riveting and Oscar worthy. He's the kind of actor who can just stand there and whole worlds are expressed in his strangely compelling face - an instrument I'm sure the director knew would have us hooked right from the get go. When Mads smiles, you smile, when he hurts - you hurt. When he's on screen, he's riveting, like say Gary Oldman is. And I can imagine, many women wouldn't mind looking at him either - long after the two hours of this is up!This Danish made movie opens with Jakob (Mads Mikkelsen) in an Indian orphanage - where he is distributing food from a truck, giving lessons in English in a shed of a building and generally holding it all together. But as always - lack of funds threathen imminent closure and the destitute children will be evicted out onto the harsh streets. He gets a phonecall from Denmark from Jorgen (Rolf Lassgard playing a millionaire businessman) with an offer of untold millions that will keep his orphanage open and indeed even help others. He seems reluctant to go and get this gift horse, but he has to. Jakob promises the adoring children that he'll be back within a week and he won't let them down. But things change when he gets there.Attending the wedding of Anna (Jorgen's daughter), to his astonishment, Jakob recognises Jorgen's wife - and she him - there's been history. Without giving too much plot away - Jakob makes a staggering and life-changing discovery and also, slowly but surely, begins to understand Jorgen's interest in wanting him back in Denmark.This is about family, loved ones, the preciousness of our kids, betrayal, bad mistakes made in the past, another chance given to redeem them now - all  the best stuff - and although some of the performances are at times slightly 'over-the-top' - the movie has heart - and you root for these people all the way to the end.The cast is uniformly excellent - especially Mikkelson and Lassgard - who's rivalry and shared loves are beautifully and realistically handled. There were many scenes where tears willingly plopped out of my weary goggleboxes. And there's superb complimentary music too.I loved this film - I really did.

So as much as Jacob dislikes the idea, and at this point we know not why, he returns to Denmark in Susanne Bier's remarkable, emotionally charged, sometimes even overwrought ""After the Wedding.""Bier has composed this film in much the same way as a Verismo opera: scenes of confrontation, scenes of enlightenment, scenes of disclosure are piled one on top of the other as the film slithers insinuatingly towards its tragic yet redemptive denouement.All of the main characters: Jacob, Jorgen, Jorgen's wife Helene (Sidse Babett Knudsen in a mature, sexy performance) and Helene and Jorgen's daughter, Anna (Stine Fischer Christiansen: young, fresh, committed) are transformed, turned around and pointed in another direction psychically and physically by film's end due to the catastrophic upheavals that they endure during the course of this amazing film. Bier is dealing with Melodrama here, with a capital ""M."" Melodrama done up right: not as a joke but as serious and humane as the Master's of this genre: Almodovar and Douglas Sirk (""Written on the Wind"") to name a couple.Mikkelsen's Jacob, due in a large part to Mikkelsen's hang-dog, stoic physical appearance, is an empty vessel at the beginning of this film. His work at the refuge is fulfilling and good yet you can't help feeling that Jacob is hiding from life rather than contributing to it and that his reluctance to venture back home to Denmark is his way of primarily keeping his past at arm's length. By the end, Jacob is transformed, filled up, overflowing by way of the redemptive powers of confession and acceptance: he's been opened, upended, turned inside out.Don't come to Bier's world of ""After the Wedding"" expecting to be lulled into anything resembling a calm, quiet mood...you will genuinely be unsettled.

I did not immediately recognize the varied dimensions of this finely nuanced performance, a hidden treasure which I only gradually realized through repeated, extended exposure, coupled with my increasing understanding of the underlying psychological dynamics which this actress's film character may have been experiencing, and which this actress's performance sought to convey - which she does with aplomb.Sidse Babett Knudsen's acting is remarkable for another reason: she is playing more than just one role, she is playing three: (tycoon's) wife, mother, and former lover.  Each of these roles requires very distinct character acting, each of which this actress plays distinctively, convincingly, and with powerful feminine magnetism.Some of the most compelling and effective acting by Sidse Babette Knudsen, as Helene Hansson, is principally conveyed by this actress's wide range of captivating facial expressions, many of which were so subtle and discreet as to be barely perceptible (see her tete-a-tete with Mads Mikkelsen, conducted over a side table at her manor house) - this caliber and range of acting is terrific stuff.I am not bothered, like some, by numerous close-up shots of the film's four principal characters.  Aren't we talking frontal cortex here? I feel these close-up shots are valid and effective, sometime capturing a film character's private, interior moments, and sometimes a film character's behavioral sine qua non - as with the pivotal realization by Jorgen Hansson's wife Helene, to remarks by the grandmother re her son Jorgen's chauffeur, etc. (followed by a close-up shot of a chandelier's dangling glass chimes).Intimate, ""non-invasive"" close-up shots, taken from the side, enable the tender capture of  ""getting to know you"" or ""catching up"" moments, when a young girl touchingly examins the facial expressions of her newly-discovered biological father, to see whether he is genuinely interested in viewing the pictures in her childhood photo album.Considering the magnitude and nature of the information which this film's principal characters have to process, and when and in what contexts they have to process it, close-up shots of eyes may be considered to be part of this film's ""action"" - as, in fact, it is.I doubt that this film's type of intimate psychological action could be conveyed effectively to an audience in stage acting, where an audience is relatively distant from actors, as it can be conveyed in a film's intimate, and sometimes mandatory, close-up shots, as we see in this film.It's unfortunate for those of us who do not watch or are not saturated or jaded by soap opera, etc., to be burdened and distracted by some commentators' cheapening, maudlin comparisons of this refreshing, high quality film to, e.g., soap opera.",5,Hidden Treasure,1340582400,"06 25, 2012",2012,3031,"['accolades', 'accorded', 'two', 'leading', 'male', 'actors', 'movie', 'are', 'well', 'only', 'slowly', 'grew', 'consciousness', 'outstandingly', 'nuanced', 'performance', 'actress', 'Sidse', 'Babett', 'Knudsen', 'role', 'Jorgen', 'Hansson', 'wife', 'Helene', 'did', 'not', 'immediately', 'recognize', 'varied', 'dimensions', 'finely', 'nuanced', 'performance', 'hidden', 'treasure', 'only', 'gradually', 'realized', 'repeated', 'extended', 'exposure', 'coupled', 'increasing', 'understanding', 'underlying', 'psychological', 'dynamics', 'actress', 'film', 'character', 'may', 'have', 'been', 'experiencing', 'actress', 'performance', 'sought', 'convey', 'aplomb.Sidse', 'Babett', 'Knudsen', 'acting', 'remarkable', 'reason', 'playing', 'more', 'just', 'one', 'role', 'playing', 'three', 'tycoon', 'wife', 'mother', 'former', 'lover', 'roles', 'very', 'distinct', 'character', 'acting', 'actress', 'distinctively', 'convincingly', 'powerful', 'feminine', 'magnetism.Some', 'most', 'compelling', 'effective', 'acting', 'Sidse', 'Babette', 'Knudsen', 'Helene', 'Hansson', 'principally', 'conveyed', 'actress', 'wide', 'range', 'captivating', 'facial', 'expressions', 'many', 'were', 'so', 'subtle', 'discreet', 'be', 'barely', 'perceptible', 'see', 'tete-a-tete', 'Mads', 'Mikkelsen', 'conducted', 'side', 'table', 'manor', 'house', 'caliber', 'range', 'acting', 'terrific', 'stuff.I', 'am', 'not', 'bothered', 'numerous', 'close-up', 'shots', 'film', 'four', 'principal', 'characters', 'Are', ""n't"", 'talking', 'frontal', 'cortex', 'here', 'feel', 'close-up', 'shots', 'are', 'valid', 'effective', 'sometime', 'capturing', 'film', 'character', 'private', 'interior', 'moments', 'sometimes', 'film', 'character', 'behavioral', 'sine', 'qua', 'non', 'pivotal', 'realization', 'Jorgen', 'Hansson', 'wife', 'Helene', 'remarks', 'grandmother', 're', 'son', 'Jorgen', 'chauffeur', 'etc', 'followed', 'close-up', 'shot', 'chandelier', 'dangling', 'glass', 'chimes', '.Intimate', 'non-invasive', 'close-up', 'shots', 'taken', 'side', 'enable', 'tender', 'capture', 'getting', 'know', 'catching', 'up', 'moments', 'when', 'young', 'girl', 'touchingly', 'facial', 'expressions', 'newly-discovered', 'biological', 'father', 'see', 'genuinely', 'interested', 'viewing', 'pictures', 'childhood', 'photo', 'album.Considering', 'magnitude', 'nature', 'information', 'film', 'principal', 'characters', 'have', 'process', 'when', 'what', 'contexts', 'have', 'process', 'close-up', 'shots', 'eyes', 'may', 'be', 'considered', 'be', 'part', 'film', 'action', 'fact', 'is.I', 'doubt', 'film', 'type', 'intimate', 'psychological', 'action', 'could', 'be', 'conveyed', 'effectively', 'audience', 'stage', 'acting', 'where', 'audience', 'relatively', 'distant', 'actors', 'can', 'be', 'conveyed', 'film', 'intimate', 'sometimes', 'mandatory', 'close-up', 'shots', 'see', 'film.It', 'unfortunate', 'who', 'do', 'not', 'watch', 'are', 'not', 'saturated', 'jaded', 'soap', 'opera', 'etc.', 'be', 'burdened', 'distracted', 'commentators', 'cheapening', 'maudlin', 'comparisons', 'refreshing', 'high', 'quality', 'film', 'e.g.', 'soap', 'opera']",After the Wedding

It is a surprise to see Mads Mikkelsen who you probably recognized from the latest James Bond 007 Film, ""Casino Royale"".  He actually shines quite nicely in this role.It's difficult to describe the plot without giving too much away.  But, I must say that there is a lot of care in slowly revealing the relationship between the main character, Jacob, and the other characters in the wedding.  The film presents the happiness, despair, dreams, acheivements, failures, etc. in life which is pretty much like everyone's life in general.  We are faced with tough decisions in life and deal with it just like these characters.  In the end, we just appreciate what we have and continue living.

It gives us a range of emotions, and the acting is superb.Jacob, played by Mads Mikkelsen, manages an orphanage in India. He and his group are looking for funding to keep the orphanage afloat. He gets word that a man with influence and money wants to see him before he will give money to the orphanage. Jacob reluctantly returns to Denmark. Here he meets Jergen, played by Rolf Lasagard, who wants to be his benefactor. This man has power, too much money and Jacob is not impressed. It appears that Jergen wants to think about the funding over the weekend, in the meantime, he invites Jacob to his daughter's wedding. This is where the film takes off. At the church Jacob recognizes Jergen's wife, Helena. Helena, played by Sidse Babett Knudsen, is shocked to see Jacob- we understand right away that they had a relationship. During the wedding and reception, we come to also understand that Jacob is probably the father of the bride. This is quite a soap opera. However, this is only the beginning. Jergen has plans, and as the film evolves we see that instead of the ogre, he may have planned something. He is not thhe uncaring man, he seems to be. Jergen has a scene that is masterful and one of the best I have seen.'After The Wedding' shows us what sacrifice is all about. Jacob for his orphans and Jergen for his family.

1063356,A39IY0JU5JI69G,B000OCY7JE,"Promise ""promise""","[1, 2]","I knew nothing about this film and when it started I was instantly drawn in by the strange but moving presence of the young European man working in an orphanage in India.  We soon learn that a benefactor in Denmark, where, it turns out, the young man. Jacob, is from, has offered a huge sum of money to the orphanage and Jacob goes back to Denmark to get it. It's the first time he's set foot in Denmark in twenty years and he is somewhat hostile to the whole scene, but is doing it for the money.  The older man, Jurgen, is an extremely successful, self made man, very Type A, who expansively invites Jacob to the wedding of his daughter, Anna, which is being held that weekend.  Jacob doesn't seem like a party guy but, having nothing else to do, and really wanting that grant, he shows up at the wedding.Here's where the plot thickens.  There are strange looks passing between Jurgen's wife, Helene and Jacob and soon we realize that Anna might just be the product of an affair between Helene and Jacob back in India.  It's a very interesting set up and I was really eager to see where the plot would lead us.  I think that, in the hands of a better director it might have been very good.  As it was, it was terribly melodramatic, really over the top performances in some parts, which made the characters lose any credibility.  The actors tried valiantly and there were some parts that I found genuinely moving, but much of the second half of the film was tacky.I found the Danish countryside nice to see, especially the well appointed house of Jurgen and the interesting countryclub where the wedding party was held.  There sure were a lot of stuffed animal heads on the walls, though, and the occasional close ups of these beasts was supposed to symbolized something important, I guess, but to me they just looked creepy.  Likewise, the many close ups of peoples' eyes.  It was an attempt to be arty that really failed and further cheapened what could have been a much better film.

One is wondering if his charity work in orphanage is his life's calling, or a character's way of punishing oneself for life choices made long ago.  As money for the orphanage is dwindling, the benefactor appears offering financial help.  But like every charity, this one has a catch too.  Scenes from having main character Jacob return from Indian subcontinent to Europe show his displacement in the world he originated from.  It is obvious that he has been away for too long and everything, from his beautiful, tanned face to the suit he is wearing looks awkward in his new surrounding.  It feels as if he almost wishes to leap back to India and his familiar surroundings in orphanage.  And from this point on, story starts developing with surprises on every step along the way.  Emotional intensity keeps building and building.  I have not seen a movie so powerful like this one since ""Barbarian Invasions"".

Still, director Susanne Bier has kept the events from being sappy melodrama.Without blabbing away too much of the plot, Jacob (Mads Mikkelson) runs an orphanage in India, in sad financial state, and is given an offer he can't refuse. He goes back to Denmark to meet his benefactor (Rolf Lassgard), and here's where loads of angst and deception develop. Turns out Jacob and the benefactor's wife have history (young, baby-booming hippie lovers, at one time). When invited to their daughter's wedding, realizations happen and all hell breaks loose. Stine Fischer Christensen (as Anna, the daughter) is remarkable, and her mother, Helene (Sidse Babett Knudsen) is even better, letter-perfect. The benefactor, Jorgen,  seems to have the upper hand, but as everything unfolds, true and honest characterizations develop. Can't say much more without giving away essential plot points, but I was riveted and highly entertained. The DVD extras are insightful, especially interviews with the director. The film is beautfully shot, and all the acting is excellent. I also enjoyed Christian Tafdrup, as the groom of the title-wedding.

1063362,A19ZXK9HHVRV1X,B000OCY7JE,Roland E. Zwick,"[2, 2]","****1/2From Denmark comes ""After the Wedding,"" an unusually rich and complex human drama, marked by superb performances, insightful writing, and stylish direction by Susanne Bier.  Nominated by the Motion Picture Academy for Best Foreign Language Film of 2006 (but not released commercially in the U.S. until the following year), this is one of the true unheralded movie gems of 2007.Jacob (Mads Mikkelsen) is a dedicated social worker from Denmark whose orphanage in India has caught the eye of a Danish philanthropist named Jergen (Rolf Lassgard), who summons the young man to Copenhagen to discuss his plan for donating a substantial sum of his own money to the project.  While in the city, Jacob is invited to attend the wedding of Jergen's adopted daughter, Anna, only to discover when he gets there that Jergen's wife is, in reality, his old girlfriend, Helene, and that Anna might, in fact, be the child he never knew he had.With a screenplay by Bier and Anders Thomas Jensen, ""After the Wedding"" transcends the ""soap opera"" nature of its premise to become a deeply moving study of the compromises and sacrifices all of us are forced to make throughout the course of our lives.  The characters the writers have come up with are admirably complex, credibly three-dimensional, and never all that easy to peg.  With his somber, deeply lined face masking the emotional turmoil within, Mikkelsen gives a darkly brooding performance as a man who finds it easier to give of himself on a grand scale - i.e., trying to save the world - than to make a meaningful connection with any single individual.  Sidse Babette Knudson is poised and lovely as Jacob`s deeply conflicted former lover and Jergen`s wife, while Lassgard hits amazing dramatic heights as Jergen, who is, in many ways, the most enigmatic of the three main characters.  For much of the film, we are left to ponder whether Jergen is a genuinely good man or merely a world-class manipulator who enjoys playing god with the lives of those around him.  Finally, Stine Fischer Christensen delivers a deeply touching performance as the vulnerable young woman whose wedding serves as the catalyst for much of the drama.  There are no heroes or villains in this piece, only flawed but well-meaning and believable individuals whom we come to care deeply about throughout the course of the film.In her direction, Bier brings a great deal of texture to the work, focusing on the subtle details of the scenes and boring into the very souls of the characters through intense close-up concentration on the actors' pores and eyes.  The music by Johan Soderqvist is subtle and haunting and adds tremendous flavor to the drama.""After the Wedding"" is a beautiful film that sweeps us up in its story and characters and makes us intimate participants in the world it is showing us.  It is both heartbreaking and thought-provoking in roughly equal measure - and what more could one ask of a movie?",4,an extraordinary achievement,1190160000,"09 19, 2007",2007,2938,"['Denmark', 'Wedding', 'unusually', 'rich', 'complex', 'human', 'drama', 'marked', 'superb', 'performances', 'insightful', 'writing', 'stylish', 'direction', 'Susanne', 'Bier', 'Nominated', 'Motion', 'Picture', 'Academy', 'Best', 'Foreign', 'Language', 'Film', '2006', 'not', 'released', 'commercially', 'U.S.', 'following', 'year', 'one', 'true', 'unheralded', 'movie', 'gems', '2007.Jacob', 'Mads', 'Mikkelsen', 'dedicated', 'social', 'worker', 'Denmark', 'orphanage', 'India', 'caught', 'eye', 'Danish', 'philanthropist', 'named', 'Jergen', 'Rolf', 'Lassgard', 'who', 'young', 'man', 'Copenhagen', 'discuss', 'plan', 'donating', 'substantial', 'sum', 'own', 'money', 'project', 'city', 'Jacob', 'invited', 'attend', 'wedding', 'Jergen', 'adopted', 'daughter', 'Anna', 'only', 'discover', 'when', 'there', 'Jergen', 'wife', 'reality', 'old', 'girlfriend', 'Helene', 'Anna', 'might', 'fact', 'be', 'child', 'never', 'knew', 'screenplay', 'Bier', 'Anders', 'Thomas', 'Jensen', 'Wedding', 'soap', 'opera', 'nature', 'premise', 'become', 'deeply', 'moving', 'study', 'compromises', 'sacrifices', 'are', 'forced', 'make', 'course', 'lives', 'characters', 'writers', 'have', 'come', 'up', 'are', 'admirably', 'complex', 'credibly', 'three-dimensional', 'never', 'easy', 'peg', 'somber', 'deeply', 'lined', 'face', 'masking', 'emotional', 'turmoil', 'Mikkelsen', 'darkly', 'brooding', 'performance', 'man', 'who', 'easier', 'give', 'grand', 'scale', 'i.e.', 'trying', 'save', 'world', 'make', 'meaningful', 'connection', 'single', 'individual', 'Sidse', 'Babette', 'Knudson', 'poised', 'lovely', 'Jacob', 's', 'deeply', 'conflicted', 'former', 'lover', 'Jergen', 's', 'wife', 'Lassgard', 'amazing', 'dramatic', 'heights', 'Jergen', 'who', 'many', 'ways', 'most', 'enigmatic', 'three', 'main', 'characters', 'much', 'film', 'are', 'left', 'ponder', 'Jergen', 'genuinely', 'good', 'man', 'merely', 'world-class', 'manipulator', 'who', 'playing', 'god', 'lives', 'Finally', 'Stine', 'Fischer', 'Christensen', 'deeply', 'touching', 'performance', 'vulnerable', 'young', 'woman', 'wedding', 'serves', 'catalyst', 'much', 'drama', 'are', 'heroes', 'villains', 'piece', 'only', 'flawed', 'well-meaning', 'believable', 'individuals', 'whom', 'come', 'care', 'deeply', 'course', 'film.In', 'direction', 'Bier', 'great', 'deal', 'texture', 'work', 'focusing', 'subtle', 'details', 'scenes', 'boring', 'very', 'souls', 'characters', 'intense', 'close-up', 'concentration', 'actors', 'pores', 'eyes', 'music', 'Johan', 'Soderqvist', 'subtle', 'haunting', 'tremendous', 'flavor', 'drama', 'Wedding', 'beautiful', 'film', 'up', 'story', 'characters', 'intimate', 'participants', 'world', 'showing', 'heartbreaking', 'thought-provoking', 'roughly', 'equal', 'measure', 'what', 'more', 'could', 'one', 'ask', 'movie']",After the Wedding

This film is extraordinary, and therefore, I fear not being able to convey the extent of its qualities. Having said that, this is not a movie for everyone, since it develops at a slow pace and, in the typical fashion of Scandinavian movies, spends quite a bit of time contemplating the faces of the actors, in order to allow the viewer to understand their emotions. However, unless the pace is something that really bothers you, this is a movie that you cannot afford to miss.Jacob is working in India helping homeless children, and in an effort to secure funds for his quest, sees himself forced to travel back home, to Denmark, to meet with the CEO of an important corporation. Upon his arrival, he meets this affable family man, Jorgen, who promptly asks him to stay over the weekend and attend his daughter's wedding. When Jacob sees Jorgen's wife, he realizes that he already knows her, and when a speech by the bride reveals unsettling information, things get complicated really fast. After that, emotions rise to the surface and we witness one of the most beautiful and moving stories I have seen in a long time.This film not only has a wonderful plot as a backbone, but also counts with an astounding cast, all of whom play their roles to perfection, and excellent cinematography. The use of the cameras, especially with close-ups of the eyes when emotional scenes are developing, works perfectly. As if this was not enough, the little I know about Scandinavian culture was proficiently presented. I attended a friend's wedding in Sweden earlier this year and I was amazed at how similar this was to what they showed in the movie.

A strong willed wealthy man who manipulates everything and those who love him and wish to be in line with his dominance. We wait to see if $ will win . Claustrophobic. Mr Mads plays it close to the chest. There is not one but two men who are wired to protect the security of others particularly one woman. Basically that is the premise. A soapy drama based on these tight social 'taking care of'  themes. The ending is supposed to look somewhat happy but feels dismal. The king of manipulation has played everyone. No one shines in this in fact everyone is equally suppressed. Natural look to the lighting(just mentioning). I suppose the nastiness of the financial element in combination with a family plot makes for a very medieval story. Think marriage to maintain political security between territories. Overly tight social guilt and weak personalities make the film grim.

The story centers on human relationships, and the tangled webs that connect one individual to another, as well as family ties.Jacob [Mads Mikkelsen, more familiar as the villain from Casino Royale] has devoted his time and many years to establishing humanitarian projects in India. He is told that the orphanage he is working in is running low on funds and is persuaded by the director of the orphanage to return to Denmark to negotiate a possible deal, a large donation from a prominent businessman. When Jacob arrives in Denmark, he meets Jorgen [Rolf Larsson] who seems almost uninterested in the details about the orphanage and doesn't give an immediate answer as to whether he will bail out the orphanage. Jorgen then insists that Jacob attend Jorgen's daughter's wedding, and Jacob reluctantly agrees.At the wedding, Jacob is stunned to discover that Jorgen's wife is Helene, a woman from Jacob's past. Soon after this meeting, the drama escalates, as Jacob begins to feel he is some sort of pawn in a game orchestrated by Jorgen. Needless to say, all is not as it seems and Jacob questions Jorgen's motives, as does Helene.There are plenty of twists and turns in this movie, and at times, it does appear contrived, but the excellent acting, especially by the actors playing Jorgen, Jacob and Helene, as well as the assured direction elevates this movie above a regular melodrama. There are some truly poignant moments that had me all weepy, but this is after all a drama about human frailties and the complex ties that bind people to one another.The DVD comes with extra features such as a 2006 interview with the director [in Danish], 8 deleted scenes,and an eight-min featurette that has a movie critic discussing the deleted scenes with the director.
