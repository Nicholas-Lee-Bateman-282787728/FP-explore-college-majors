I'll admit that I own some poor quality budget DVD's, but this has to be one of the worst I've ever seen. The source material for this release must have come from a worn out bootleg VHS, collecting dust in the basement of a Funeral Home.The video image is plagued with speckling, debris and annoying lines that fill the TV screen throughout the film, way to much for any fan of this movie to tolerate. The colors are pretty much washed out and the print is way too dark. The movie is barely viewable in my opinion and this review should serve as a warning to any fan of this movie. Buyer Beware!I've always regarded ""Funeral Home"" as an underrated creepy Canadian classic from the 1980's and I was super excited when my copy finally arrived. When I looked on Amazon on the day of release, it said the film was out of stock; I thought this was a good thing. Sadly my excitement quickly went away the second I put the DVD into my player. Some things should remain buried and this poor effort from CFS is one of them. My copy is already on its way back to Amazon.",1,"CAN YOU SAY, POOR QUALITY RELEASE!",1332547200,"03 24, 2012",2012,1245,"['evident', 'once', 'film', 'amount', 'restoration', 'effort', 'was', 'put', 'DVD', 'release', 'CFS', 'company', 'responsible', 'horrible', 'bootleg', 'video/audio', 'quality', ""'ll"", 'admit', 'own', 'poor', 'quality', 'budget', 'DVD', 'be', 'one', 'worst', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'seen', 'source', 'material', 'release', 'must', 'have', 'come', 'worn', 'out', 'bootleg', 'VHS', 'collecting', 'dust', 'basement', 'Funeral', 'Home.The', 'video', 'image', 'plagued', 'speckling', 'debris', 'annoying', 'lines', 'fill', 'TV', 'screen', 'film', 'way', 'much', 'fan', 'movie', 'tolerate', 'colors', 'are', 'pretty', 'much', 'washed', 'out', 'print', 'way', 'too', 'dark', 'movie', 'barely', 'viewable', 'opinion', 'review', 'should', 'serve', 'warning', 'fan', 'movie', 'Buyer', 'Beware', ""'ve"", 'always', 'regarded', 'Funeral', 'Home', 'underrated', 'creepy', 'Canadian', 'classic', '1980', 'was', 'super', 'excited', 'when', 'copy', 'finally', 'arrived', 'When', 'looked', 'Amazon', 'day', 'release', 'said', 'film', 'was', 'stock', 'thought', 'was', 'good', 'thing', 'Sadly', 'excitement', 'quickly', 'went', 'away', 'second', 'put', 'DVD', 'player', 'things', 'should', 'remain', 'buried', 'poor', 'effort', 'CFS', 'one', 'copy', 'already', 'way', 'back', 'Amazon']",N/A
960481,A1U0U8WIXTCPT6,B000CQLZ88,Timmy D.,"[2, 3]","Saw this flim as part of an ""X"" rated (for the time) drive in movie triple feature in 1983...""The Hearse"", ""Funeral Home"", and the sole reason they could call it ""X""...""The Gates of Hell"" (aka: ""City of the Living Dead"" by Lucio Fulci).  It was long before the current (and pretty much useless) rating of NC17.  This was back in the day when ""X"" could be for violence.  I have fond recollections of that evening but I recalled ""Funeral Home"" wasn't very good.  24 years later it's finally on DVD & it still isn't very good.  William Fruet directs this leaden picture with almost zero thrills.  The few genuine horror aspects of the film are totally run of the mill & tame.  Most of the movie's running time is spent with a boring storyline, boring dialog & boring characters.  There are a few atmospheric shots but that's about all it has going for it.  This film reminds me of the stale popcorn I ate at the drive in that night.  The acting is fine.  The grandma (while not appealing or very interesting) is okay but mostly her character comes off as just annoying.  The lead actress Lesleh Donaldson is a decent enough & shows off some acting chops but somehow doesn't convey ""lead"" to me in this particular film.  Barry Morse does a fine job as Mr. Davis.  Harvey Atkin of ""Meatballs"" & ""Cagney & Lacey"" fame rips out one of his patented ""jovial goofball"" roles.  He's always reliable.  Finally Peggy Mahon does a pretty good job of pulling off the ""cheap floozie"" role she's given.  She's actually very funny while tormenting the village idiot with her wicked ""come hither"" banter.  But the film is just outright boring.  You think from the ominous title it will be a horrific thrill ride like maybe a poor man's ""Phantasm"".  It's nothing like that.  Just a slow moving ""who done it?"" type of thing.Legacy Entertainment has dropped the ball as well in this release.  One big mistake was the boxcover.  Pretty ""blah"".  Okay well the spooky funeral home looks fairly creepy.  But what sucked me in as a kid was the original one-sheet theatrical poster (check it out at imdb.com).  Very cool...a hand coming out of the ground onto a gravestone, the backlit funeral home off in the distance, and what appears to be zombies surrounding the walkway.  Why Legacy didn't use that is beyond me.  I'm sure it would suck in a few buyers just with that creepy picture (however misleading those images are).  Lastly the picture quality.  Really bad.  Full screen, grainy, looks like a transfer from VHS.  Worst of all are the hum bars that roll through the movie the ENTIRE running time!  Totally unacceptable & very annoying.  The tagline for this flick was ""Some things never rest in peace"".  It's too bad somebody unearthed this flick 24 years after it stank the first time.",2,Pretty Poor,1194307200,"11 6, 2007",2007,2768,"['Saw', 'flim', 'part', 'X', 'rated', 'time', 'drive', 'movie', 'triple', 'feature', '1983', 'Hearse', 'Funeral', 'Home', 'sole', 'reason', 'could', 'call', 'X', 'Gates', 'Hell', 'aka', 'City', 'Living', 'Dead', 'Lucio', 'Fulci', 'was', 'long', 'current', 'pretty', 'much', 'useless', 'rating', 'NC17', 'was', 'back', 'day', 'when', 'X', 'could', 'be', 'violence', 'have', 'fond', 'recollections', 'evening', 'recalled', 'Funeral', 'Home', 'was', ""n't"", 'very', 'good', '24', 'years', 'later', 'finally', 'DVD', 'still', ""n't"", 'very', 'good', 'William', 'Fruet', 'leaden', 'picture', 'almost', 'zero', 'thrills', 'few', 'genuine', 'horror', 'aspects', 'film', 'are', 'totally', 'run', 'mill', 'tame', 'Most', 'movie', 'running', 'time', 'spent', 'boring', 'storyline', 'boring', 'dialog', 'boring', 'characters', 'are', 'few', 'atmospheric', 'shots', 'going', 'film', 'stale', 'popcorn', 'ate', 'drive', 'night', 'acting', 'fine', 'grandma', 'not', 'appealing', 'very', 'interesting', 'okay', 'mostly', 'character', 'off', 'just', 'annoying', 'lead', 'actress', 'Lesleh', 'Donaldson', 'decent', 'enough', 'off', 'acting', 'chops', 'somehow', ""n't"", 'convey', 'lead', 'particular', 'film', 'Barry', 'Morse', 'fine', 'job', 'Mr.', 'Davis', 'Harvey', 'Atkin', 'Meatballs', 'Cagney', 'Lacey', 'fame', 'out', 'one', 'patented', 'jovial', 'goofball', 'roles', 'always', 'reliable', 'Finally', 'Peggy', 'Mahon', 'pretty', 'good', 'job', 'pulling', 'off', 'cheap', 'floozie', 'role', 'given', 'actually', 'very', 'funny', 'tormenting', 'village', 'idiot', 'wicked', 'come', 'hither', 'banter', 'film', 'just', 'outright', 'boring', 'think', 'ominous', 'title', 'will', 'be', 'horrific', 'thrill', 'ride', 'maybe', 'poor', 'man', 'Phantasm', 'nothing', 'Just', 'slow', 'moving', 'who', 'done', 'type', 'thing.Legacy', 'Entertainment', 'dropped', 'ball', 'as', 'well', 'release', 'One', 'big', 'mistake', 'was', 'boxcover', 'Pretty', 'blah', 'Okay', 'well', 'spooky', 'funeral', 'home', 'fairly', 'creepy', 'what', 'sucked', 'kid', 'was', 'original', 'one-sheet', 'theatrical', 'poster', 'check', 'out', 'imdb.com', 'Very', 'cool', 'hand', 'coming', 'ground', 'gravestone', 'backlit', 'funeral', 'home', 'distance', 'what', 'be', 'zombies', 'surrounding', 'walkway', 'Why', 'Legacy', 'did', ""n't"", 'use', ""'m"", 'sure', 'would', 'suck', 'few', 'buyers', 'just', 'creepy', 'picture', 'however', 'misleading', 'images', 'are', 'Lastly', 'picture', 'quality', 'Really', 'bad', 'Full', 'screen', 'grainy', 'transfer', 'VHS', 'Worst', 'are', 'hum', 'roll', 'movie', 'ENTIRE', 'running', 'time', 'Totally', 'unacceptable', 'very', 'annoying', 'tagline', 'flick', 'was', 'things', 'never', 'rest', 'peace', 'too', 'bad', 'somebody', 'unearthed', 'flick', '24', 'years', 'stank', 'first', 'time']",N/A
