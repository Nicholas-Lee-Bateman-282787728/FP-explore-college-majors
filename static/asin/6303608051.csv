381514,A31UE0LJBKCHUA,6303608051,A Customer,"[11, 13]","After the wooha over Moulin Rouge, I doubt one would ever expect that director Baz Lurhman (also known for the atrocious remake of Romeo and Juliet) to have anything to do with classical music.  Well this video from 1993 is proof, and excellent proof a that.  While there are some Lurhman-isms in there that are rather reminiscent of Moulin Rouge (ie: The big light-up red sign that says &quot;L'amour&quot;), this is pretty different ground for Lurhman.  He sets it in Post-WWII Paris, which is a wonderful move that portrays the bohemians in an incredibly different light (Rent, anyone?) that breathes new life into this Puccini classic.  Add an incredibly talented cast (and a pretty darn attractive Rodolfo) to boot, and this video easily earns 5 stars.  If you're looking to buy a video of La Boheme, I would reccomend this one, however if you have never seen the show live, you may want to get a video of a traditional production to see what it's original intention was, it makes for some great comparisons!",5,Brilliant!,1007251200,"12 2, 2001",2001,1013,"['wooha', 'Moulin', 'Rouge', 'doubt', 'one', 'would', 'ever', 'expect', 'director', 'Baz', 'Lurhman', 'also', 'known', 'atrocious', 'remake', 'Romeo', 'Juliet', 'have', 'anything', 'do', 'classical', 'music', 'Well', 'video', '1993', 'proof', 'excellent', 'proof', 'are', 'Lurhman-isms', 'are', 'rather', 'reminiscent', 'Moulin', 'Rouge', 'ie', 'big', 'light-up', 'red', 'sign', 'quot', ""L'amour"", 'quot', 'pretty', 'different', 'ground', 'Lurhman', 'Post-WWII', 'Paris', 'wonderful', 'move', 'bohemians', 'incredibly', 'different', 'light', 'Rent', 'anyone', 'new', 'life', 'Puccini', 'classic', 'Add', 'incredibly', 'talented', 'cast', 'pretty', 'darn', 'attractive', 'Rodolfo', 'boot', 'video', 'easily', '5', 'stars', ""'re"", 'looking', 'buy', 'video', 'La', 'Boheme', 'would', 'reccomend', 'one', 'however', 'have', 'never', 'seen', 'show', 'live', 'may', 'want', 'get', 'video', 'traditional', 'production', 'see', 'what', 'original', 'intention', 'was', 'great', 'comparisons']","Puccini - La Boheme / Baz Luhrmann, The Australian Opera VHS"
381515,A2LN2AK7HNBI8N,6303608051,Bruce Varner,"[4, 5]","Having seen and heard so many productions of this great opera, including seeing the incomparable team of Freni and Pavarotti, I approached this production with some trepidation.  Baz Luhrmann is a respected director, but inexperienced in opera.  The cast looked a little too pretty, and I worried that the whole thing might be just a tad too slick for me.  Those worries completely vanished by Mimi's entrance.  This is an excellent production, suitable for both opera neophytes and connoisseurs.David Hobson may just be the best looking Rodolfo you've ever seen.  He gave a wonderful, fully invested performance.  His vocal problems were a fast vibrato and some lip and jaw tension.  Nonetheless, he sang in tune, and was completely believable as the poet who loses his heart to Mimi.  Cheryl Barker was an excellent Mimi.  Her most important and exposed arias (""Si. Mi chiamano Mimi"" and ""Donde lieta usci"") were very well done.  Her only issue was Italian pronunciation, an issue she shared with others in the cast.  Christine Douglas was a very good Musetta.  She was feisty, flirty, and just a bit of a diva. She would be a perfect Musetta, were it not for some intonation issues.  I really enjoyed listening to and watching Roger Lemke as Marcello.  He's got an amazing baritone instrument, and he sang and acted the part beautifully.  David Lemke (Schaunard) and Gary Rowley (Colline) were amazing singers.But in my mind, what sets this opera apart and makes it worth owning is the production itself.  It is visually interesting.  The gray, dingy garret in Act 1 is contrasted by vibrant costume colors on the guys. Color plays a prominent role in this show. Throughout much of the opera, ""L'amour"" appears prominently on the set.  The Cafe Momus scene was crowded, with well choreographed disorder and just a little decadence. The relationships between the characters were all well developed and believable.  The acting was generally outstanding.  The camera work is superb, giving you a nice seat on stage. This production really reflected a great director and an outstanding production staff.Baz Luhrmann showed his full game with Mimi's death scene.  It was amazing.  As Mimi lay dying, singing with Rodolfo, Schaunard was in a window upstage right, smoking, with his back to the audience.  He put the cigarette out on stage in a slow, defeated kind of way.  When Mimi died, all of the principals were facing at an angle upstage, heads bowed as if in prayer, with Rodolfo center stage on a ladder.  When he learns that Mimi is dead, his legs turn to rubber and it looks as though he can hardly make it down the ladder.  His audible sobbing continues though a slow, silent blackout. It was chilling, and you could hear a pin drop in the audience even after the set went to black.  Wow.Highly recommended.",4,New Look at a Puccini Standard,1229817600,"12 21, 2008",2008,2814,"['Having', 'seen', 'heard', 'so', 'many', 'productions', 'great', 'opera', 'including', 'seeing', 'incomparable', 'team', 'Freni', 'Pavarotti', 'approached', 'production', 'trepidation', 'Baz', 'Luhrmann', 'respected', 'director', 'inexperienced', 'opera', 'cast', 'looked', 'little', 'too', 'pretty', 'worried', 'whole', 'thing', 'might', 'be', 'just', 'tad', 'too', 'slick', 'worries', 'completely', 'vanished', 'Mimi', 'entrance', 'excellent', 'production', 'suitable', 'opera', 'neophytes', 'connoisseurs.David', 'Hobson', 'may', 'just', 'be', 'best', 'looking', 'Rodolfo', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'seen', 'gave', 'wonderful', 'fully', 'invested', 'performance', 'vocal', 'problems', 'were', 'fast', 'vibrato', 'lip', 'jaw', 'tension', 'Nonetheless', 'sang', 'tune', 'was', 'completely', 'believable', 'poet', 'who', 'heart', 'Mimi', 'Cheryl', 'Barker', 'was', 'excellent', 'Mimi', 'most', 'important', 'exposed', 'arias', 'Si', 'Mi', 'chiamano', 'Mimi', 'Donde', 'lieta', 'usci', 'were', 'very', 'well', 'done', 'only', 'issue', 'was', 'Italian', 'pronunciation', 'issue', 'shared', 'others', 'cast', 'Christine', 'Douglas', 'was', 'very', 'good', 'Musetta', 'was', 'feisty', 'flirty', 'just', 'bit', 'diva', 'would', 'be', 'perfect', 'Musetta', 'were', 'not', 'intonation', 'issues', 'really', 'enjoyed', 'listening', 'watching', 'Roger', 'Lemke', 'Marcello', 'got', 'amazing', 'baritone', 'instrument', 'sang', 'acted', 'part', 'beautifully', 'David', 'Lemke', 'Schaunard', 'Gary', 'Rowley', 'Colline', 'were', 'amazing', 'singers.But', 'mind', 'what', 'opera', 'apart', 'worth', 'owning', 'production', 'visually', 'interesting', 'gray', 'dingy', 'garret', 'Act', '1', 'contrasted', 'vibrant', 'costume', 'colors', 'guys', 'Color', 'prominent', 'role', 'show', 'much', 'opera', ""L'amour"", 'prominently', 'set', 'Cafe', 'Momus', 'scene', 'was', 'crowded', 'well', 'choreographed', 'disorder', 'just', 'little', 'decadence', 'relationships', 'characters', 'were', 'well', 'developed', 'believable', 'acting', 'was', 'generally', 'outstanding', 'camera', 'work', 'superb', 'giving', 'nice', 'seat', 'stage', 'production', 'really', 'reflected', 'great', 'director', 'outstanding', 'production', 'staff.Baz', 'Luhrmann', 'showed', 'full', 'game', 'Mimi', 'death', 'scene', 'was', 'amazing', 'Mimi', 'lay', 'dying', 'singing', 'Rodolfo', 'Schaunard', 'was', 'window', 'upstage', 'right', 'smoking', 'back', 'audience', 'put', 'cigarette', 'out', 'stage', 'slow', 'defeated', 'kind', 'way', 'When', 'Mimi', 'died', 'principals', 'were', 'facing', 'angle', 'upstage', 'heads', 'bowed', 'prayer', 'Rodolfo', 'center', 'stage', 'ladder', 'When', 'Mimi', 'dead', 'legs', 'turn', 'rubber', 'can', 'hardly', 'make', 'down', 'ladder', 'audible', 'sobbing', 'slow', 'silent', 'blackout', 'was', 'chilling', 'could', 'hear', 'pin', 'drop', 'audience', 'even', 'set', 'went', 'black', 'Wow.Highly', 'recommended']","Puccini - La Boheme / Baz Luhrmann, The Australian Opera VHS"

Pawl ""Dani""","[4, 6]","First of all, what drew me to watch this performance back in 1994 was director, Baz Luhrmann, who brought us the beautiful, delightfully quirky Strictly Ballroom.  I was interested to see how he would direct one of the most beautiful and heartbreaking operas I know.  Needless to say, I was completely enchanted!The story of a group of Bohemians living together, and barely scraping by, and then the writer of the group, Rudolfo (David Hobson) meeting the beautiful and frail Mimi (Cheryl Barker) who brings sunshine and hope into his life is timeless.Not only is the acting strong, but the singing is positively stirring.  I know other customers have mentioned David Hobson's portrayal of Rudolfo, but I had to add my two cents as well.  He is a magnificent and stirring singer and smouldering actor.  I kept wishing I was Mimi instead of Cheryl Barker.  From his expressive eyes, to his beautiful and graceful renditions of the arias, I was in love from the moment I saw him.  Cheryl Barker is also beautiful and very believable in her portrayal of Mimi.  Just lovely.  The supporting cast was great, too.  Schaunard, Musetta, and all of the others were portrayed with zest.

Who would dare put attractive young people who can sing well in a video of La Boheme if they could otherwise have had unattractive middle aged people who can sing very well. Let's face it, if opera as an art form is to survive, it must compete with Hollywood and TV. This is a lovely snapshot of something that happened in the recent past and does have its flaws or things some people don't like, but, we find, every opera production has someone who will say, for example, Callas would have been better. That may be true but better to take the good than to dwell on the bad. Life is short. Up with young people.
