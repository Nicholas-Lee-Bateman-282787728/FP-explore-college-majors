Just because someone bought you a video camera for your birthday doesn't mean that you can make watchable entertainment.  20 pages of dialogue and a hodge-podge of friends willing to help seem to be all that this ""film"" needed to get distributed.  This would be fine to have made for fun and to show to your friends while you get buzzed, but this film isn't ready for public viewing.  The production values are terrible.  I literally cheered at the moment that the shaky camera was finally put on a tripod.  It was the only moment I felt like cheering.  The characters are pretty universally unlikable.  The ""story"" is as thin as gauze.  The lighting was dreadful, acting was mostly uninspired, and the camera work was nauseating.  Sound did a reasonable job, although it was too bad that what they recorded wasn't worth the tape.I'm done with this.  It's already stolen too much of my time.  Don't let it waste yours.  Find some other good independent gay movie to watch.

I'm not quite sure what the actual plot was about.  Seriously.....I have no idea what I just watched.  The acting was SO incredibly bad that I felt sorry for the actors.  I've seen better acting from elementary school students.  Yes, there was like one full frontal nude scene with one of the actors sticking is balls into a drink while someone else blew bubbles on his balls through a straw, and they called it a ""ballcuzzi"".  Even that was not worth the $1.99 rental.  This movie was just plain boring and absurd.  I could go on and on, but I won't waste another second of my life on this film.  Do not, under any circumstances, waste any of your time or money on this movie.  Even if someone offers to show it to you for FREE, or if they offer to pay you to sit and watch it, you should run, don't walk, in the other direction.  It was that bad.

1356048,AG7RTXB2YXWTL,B003O68AA4,Linda Davis,"[0, 0]","I watched this movie more than once; Gay film has more to say than simply sex.  The film gives some insight into the aging homosexual, and the fears that come with age. The younger men are not teens or twenty-somethings, so they have fears of their own, but are compassionate for their older friend. Each one is seeking a relationship and it is interesting to watch this unfold.  All of the young men are beautiful, especially Gregori Holderbach with his delightful accent. This is worth seeing especially if you are interested in understanding how people think (and like beautiful men).",4,"Linda's Thoughts on ""Some Boys Do""",1381276800,"10 9, 2013",2013,587,"['watched', 'movie', 'more', 'once', 'Gay', 'film', 'more', 'say', 'simply', 'sex', 'film', 'insight', 'aging', 'homosexual', 'fears', 'come', 'age', 'younger', 'men', 'are', 'not', 'teens', 'twenty-somethings', 'have', 'fears', 'own', 'are', 'compassionate', 'older', 'friend', 'one', 'seeking', 'relationship', 'interesting', 'watch', 'unfold', 'young', 'men', 'are', 'beautiful', 'especially', 'Gregori', 'Holderbach', 'delightful', 'accent', 'worth', 'seeing', 'especially', 'are', 'interested', 'understanding', 'how', 'people', 'think', 'beautiful', 'men']",Some Boys Do
