1310743,A2CKFK43Z4CTPF,B002ZG997C,A. Bursaw,"[2, 3]","People who give this 1 star, dont seem to understand that a movie such as The Book of Eli is a form of entertainment, which an ensamble of great actors come together and deliver. People become so serious to point out its flaws that their judgement is bias, and one sided. First off. Remember this is a FICTIONAL movie and it carries a twist of religion (that the one star reviews seem to gripe about), the good and the bad, exposistion, rising action, climax, falling action, denouement. Its story covers the basics. Although many people feel queezy about religion like its some sort of big evil repulsive creature, remember to watch this movie with an open mind, and not like one of a 8 year old. This movie is entended to entertain, and it does that. If you have a big freaking problem with religion in general, then skip this movie and quit whining. Otherwise, if you give it a chance, you might actually like this movie.Although it has this ""religious"" element, The Book of Eli tries to not keep your mind focused on just that fact. It brings together the gritty action, western kind of feel as Denzel is so on point to maintain, that sometimes you forget about the whole religion theme, the bible, and all that stuff people seem to have such a problem with. I do wish there was a little more scenes with Denzel laying the smackdown on a few people. He has a mission that he is determined to carryout before he dies and nobody is going to stop him from reaching it. Not only does it have the action and the violence that mostly everyone enjoys, but you end up kind of getting drawn to Denzels character and feel drawn into to not just him, but gary oldman playing a fine villain who is determined to seize what denzel has and use it for his own greed and his own agenda. Also, it delivers the twist at the end that if you havent figured out the spoiler from the million other reviews, just makes you go ""wow."" It may not be the greatest movie ever made, but for what its worth, it is a good flick and is worth picking up or at least renting. But like I have said, if you USE AN OPEN MIND to watch this movie you might enjoy it a little more, just a thought.",5,This is a great movie...if your open minded.,1276300800,"06 12, 2010",2010,2161,"['People', 'who', 'give', '1', 'star', 'dont', 'seem', 'understand', 'movie', 'such', 'Book', 'Eli', 'form', 'entertainment', 'ensamble', 'great', 'actors', 'come', 'together', 'deliver', 'People', 'become', 'so', 'serious', 'point', 'out', 'flaws', 'judgement', 'bias', 'one', 'sided', 'First', 'off', 'Remember', 'FICTIONAL', 'movie', 'twist', 'religion', 'one', 'star', 'seem', 'gripe', 'about', 'good', 'bad', 'exposistion', 'rising', 'action', 'climax', 'falling', 'action', 'denouement', 'story', 'basics', 'many', 'people', 'feel', 'queezy', 'religion', 'sort', 'big', 'evil', 'repulsive', 'creature', 'remember', 'watch', 'movie', 'open', 'mind', 'not', 'one', '8', 'year', 'old', 'movie', 'entended', 'entertain', 'have', 'big', 'freaking', 'problem', 'religion', 'general', 'then', 'skip', 'movie', 'quit', 'whining', 'Otherwise', 'give', 'chance', 'might', 'actually', 'like', 'movie.Although', 'religious', 'element', 'Book', 'Eli', 'tries', 'not', 'keep', 'mind', 'focused', 'just', 'fact', 'together', 'gritty', 'action', 'western', 'kind', 'feel', 'Denzel', 'so', 'point', 'maintain', 'sometimes', 'forget', 'whole', 'religion', 'theme', 'bible', 'stuff', 'people', 'seem', 'have', 'problem', 'do', 'wish', 'was', 'little', 'more', 'scenes', 'Denzel', 'laying', 'smackdown', 'few', 'people', 'mission', 'determined', 'carryout', 'nobody', 'going', 'stop', 'reaching', 'Not', 'only', 'have', 'action', 'violence', 'mostly', 'everyone', 'end', 'up', 'kind', 'getting', 'drawn', 'Denzels', 'character', 'feel', 'drawn', 'not', 'just', 'gary', 'oldman', 'playing', 'fine', 'villain', 'who', 'determined', 'seize', 'what', 'denzel', 'use', 'own', 'greed', 'own', 'agenda', 'Also', 'twist', 'end', 'havent', 'figured', 'out', 'spoiler', 'million', 'other', 'reviews', 'just', 'go', 'wow', 'may', 'not', 'be', 'greatest', 'movie', 'ever', 'made', 'what', 'worth', 'good', 'flick', 'worth', 'picking', 'up', 'least', 'renting', 'have', 'said', 'USE', 'AN', 'OPEN', 'MIND', 'watch', 'movie', 'might', 'enjoy', 'little', 'more', 'just', 'thought']",N/A
1310744,A3BHHSORGTDW8K,B002ZG997C,A customer,"[1, 1]","Interesting that some people seem to be treating this movie like it is more than it is (or was meant to be). While I guess any discussion on religion can become controversial, I don't view this first and foremost as a movie that is supposed to lead to a lot of philosophical introspection, an assault against any faith, or a statement on religion itself. No one is trying to ram anything down anyone's throat, or disparage anyone's belief system.  It's just the background for the movie and its central character, and while there are surely some thematic elements here that can be discussed and debated (is that a bad thing for a movie?), really the only thing potentially offensive in the movie is the level of violence, which sadly seems to be standard fare. With that being said there are some real issues with the movie. Denzel seems to be becoming like Pacino and Deniro the more movies he does.  You kind of know what you are going to get. It works well enough here however in the end. One could also argue that all of the casting does seem just a little off, including Oldman, or maybe its just a result of direction they were given. Its probably the Oldman the Hughes brothers wanted.I would disagree with those who say there is nothing original here. Its almost impossible to make a ""post apocalyptic"" movie without having to default to some cliches. Yes, those are present, but any movie these days that contains a couple things you didn't see coming is almost worth it on its own, and I can recall three such things in The Book of Eli, a couple of which were quite clever.For people who think they would like this movie but are unsure after reading some of the more negative reviews, you can pretty much safely ignore them and dive in. Anyone who would rate this movie one star either fancies themselves a movie snob  or is someone who should have known they were not going to like it in the first place.",4,It's just a movie folks.

1310745,A2BZL35CIYJWMG,B002ZG997C,acwrite,"[1, 3]","This was a very different kind of movie for Denzel Washington.  Playing a mysterious loner named Eli, Denzel Washington has spent the last 30 years of his life walking west through a post-apocalyptic United States with what could be the last copy of the King James Bible - all because a voice in his head told him to.  He doesn't seem to understand exactly why he is doing this, but sustains the faith to do so anyway.  Along his route on the Highway of Death, he encounters much evil and hopelessness.  Still, he stays true to his mission and keeps going.Eventually he encounters Gary Oldman, playing a callous town overseer, who will stop at nothing to get the book that Eli carries and reads from every day. The plot soon turns into a good versus evil conflict with a spiritual undertone.  Eli gets the upper hand when he receives help from a young woman (Mila Kunis) who doesn't understand what the world was like before ""The Flash"" occurred and changed life forever, but who believes in Eli and wants a better life for herself and her mother.The ending of this science-fiction film is really what makes it.  It sends a powerful message about life, faith, spirituality, and hope.  If I had one criticism about this movie, it would be that it reminds me too much of the film, ""The Road,"" which was out around the same time.

It's marginally entertaining, just don't expect the plot to hold up to even the lightest of probing.Spoilers review *Don't read if you don't want it ruined*:I knew I was going to be in trouble when I saw Mila Kunis as her acting is usually pretty inexcusable, but I have to give her credit on this one. For once she wasn't the problem.I prefer apocalyptic films like The Road, where the main character is not an infallible super-god casually hacking and blasting his way through a sea of enemies like this was Resident Evil on easy mode or something. So I was almost immediately slightly disappointed. Nothing is a challenge for Eli. He could murder rapists with both arms tied behind his back.And of course the movie uses that tired old premise where one dusty old loner picks up a sidekick against his will and then instantly warms up to them and would do anything to protect them...*Serious spoilers! Beware*The most annoying twist in the whole movie is when Eli turns out to be blind and everything that he did in the movie up to that point is all because of magic, I suppose. Your guess is as good as mine. There is no way he could have done half the stuff he did in the film up to that point without his sight (hunting a completely silent cat with a bow and arrow), so the answer must be magic!The movie really ""jumped the shark"" when Eli's bible is destroyed and with his last dying breath he must dictate a new one to Malcolm McDowell. I guess being blind also gives you incredible time control powers, because it would take forever to dictate the bible to someone.

Enter Gary Oldman as a intelligent but malevolent self proclaimed leader of a small town, surviving in the dust and misery, hell bent on getting his hand on the book, and hoping to rekindle the power of faith in people for his own ends.That's about it in a nutshell really, there are some other characters of course, and little subplots, and for those familiar with the Book of Eli in the Bible itself, there are some obvious connotations added, but these are never overplayed.I want to talk about the film itself for a second and the camera work and CGI, the Blu-Ray transfer is as crisp as I have seen, and they have made this World so believable and real on screen, you can almost taste the dust. The heavily tinted camera work adds depth, and a grey despair to the whole movie, which arguably would have much flatter without it. The story itself is clever, if a little unbelievable at times, and is much more stylized than other movies of the genre, but it feels right for this movie. The acting is great from everyone, even another little cameo for Tom Waits (always a joy to watch) is great.Not a movie for repeat viewing I fancy, once you know the end, have lived the ""journey"" and got to the twist in the tale, but nonetheless a very good movie.Plenty of action pads out the more thoughtful aspects of the film, as Denzel is a sort of machete wielding one man army, as if possessed by a higher power (again the nod to religion) in his single minded of purpose, and unyielding journey.I knocked off half a star (maybe unfairly) for the frequent, ""is he or isn't he?"", ""how did he do that"", ""how come they......"" aspects of the movie, but I guess some poetic license by the Director is not all bad.Very impressive, visually stunning movie. 4.5 stars",4,Beautiful camera work,1281398400,"08 10, 2010",2010,2690,"['have', 'just', 'watched', 'reviewedThe', 'Road', '[', 'Blu-ray', ']', 'actually', 'watched', 'movie', 'first', 'felt', 'only', 'should', 'review', 'as', 'well', 'deal', 'similar', 'plotline', 'are', 'starkly', 'different', 'movies.The', 'synopsis', 'covered', 'great', 'detail', 'other', 'reviews', 'wo', ""n't"", 'spend', 'too', 'long', 'put', 'spoilers', 'story', 'so', 'much', 'more', 'was', 'quite', 'unfairly', 'described', 'one', 'professional', 'critic', 'Road', 'Warrior', 'Mad', 'Max', 'cars', 'Denzel', 'Washington', 'nomadic', 'man', 'mission', 'wandering', '30', 'years', 'post', 'apocalyptic', 'landscape', 'carrying', 'last', 'known', 'copy', 'King', 'James', 'Bible', 'answering', 'calling', 'quest', 'deliver', 'somewhere', 'important', 'knowing', 'only', 'must', 'go', 'aforementioned', 'Road', 'waylaid', 'marauding', 'gangs', 'cannibalism', 'general', 'dystopian', 'population', 'left', 'blind', 'maimed', 'catastrophe', 'occurred', 'Enter', 'Gary', 'Oldman', 'intelligent', 'malevolent', 'self', 'proclaimed', 'leader', 'small', 'town', 'surviving', 'dust', 'misery', 'hell', 'bent', 'getting', 'hand', 'book', 'hoping', 'rekindle', 'power', 'faith', 'people', 'own', 'ends.That', 'nutshell', 'really', 'are', 'other', 'characters', 'course', 'little', 'subplots', 'familiar', 'Book', 'Eli', 'Bible', 'are', 'obvious', 'connotations', 'added', 'are', 'never', 'overplayed.I', 'want', 'talk', 'film', 'second', 'camera', 'work', 'CGI', 'Blu-Ray', 'transfer', 'as', 'crisp', 'have', 'seen', 'have', 'made', 'World', 'believable', 'real', 'screen', 'can', 'almost', 'taste', 'dust', 'heavily', 'tinted', 'camera', 'work', 'depth', 'grey', 'despair', 'whole', 'movie', 'arguably', 'would', 'have', 'much', 'flatter', 'story', 'clever', 'little', 'unbelievable', 'times', 'much', 'more', 'stylized', 'other', 'movies', 'genre', 'right', 'movie', 'acting', 'great', 'everyone', 'even', 'little', 'cameo', 'Tom', 'Waits', 'always', 'joy', 'watch', 'great.Not', 'movie', 'repeat', 'viewing', 'fancy', 'once', 'know', 'end', 'have', 'lived', 'journey', 'got', 'twist', 'tale', 'nonetheless', 'very', 'good', 'movie.Plenty', 'action', 'pads', 'out', 'more', 'thoughtful', 'aspects', 'film', 'Denzel', 'sort', 'machete', 'wielding', 'one', 'man', 'army', 'possessed', 'higher', 'power', 'again', 'nod', 'religion', 'single', 'minded', 'purpose', 'unyielding', 'journey.I', 'knocked', 'off', 'star', 'maybe', 'unfairly', 'frequent', ""n't"", 'how', 'did', 'do', 'how', 'come', 'aspects', 'movie', 'guess', 'poetic', 'license', 'Director', 'not', 'bad.Very', 'impressive', 'visually', 'stunning', 'movie', '4.5', 'stars']",N/A

1310769,A3F2VVIQIY6U64,B002ZG997C,Armando N. Roman,"[49, 56]","I was hesitant to watch The Book of Eli for a while because of mixed things I'd read. Some people claimed it to be 'too religious' and others said the movie was just plain boring. Honestly, the trailers I'd seen didn't exactly win me over, but I gave the movie a shot when I was sick one day, and man did I enjoy it. If you've played the Fallout games, especially Fallout 3, you will -love- The Book of Eli. So many similarities in the look of the wasteland, in the combat scenes, the importance of water, and more. But even if you never played Fallout 3, The Book of Eli is a very enjoyable movie, provided you're not one of those people that immediately hates anything 'religious' and claims a movie is preachy, given that the subject matter here is religion...so that kind of makes you weird to say that. I'm not a Christian, and I'm definitely not an Atheist, but I didn't find anything 'preachy' about The Book of Eli.The world is in shambles. There's no law for the most part. Raiders are everywhere, looting, raping and eating people that pass by. Clean water and food is tough to find. Of course it's a rough life. Most people wouldn't think much of it, but imagine your life as you know it right now taking a turn for the worst, and you no longer have any luxuries- you're a scavenger from now on. That's the world Eli lives in. Eli is on a mission, and tries to stay on the path, as he puts it, and needs to go to a specific location to deliver an important book that no one else is allowed to see or read. At the same time, the ability to read has been lost over the years, and very few people are able to do so. Eli is one, and the other is a corrupt man, Carnegie, who runs a town that Eli enters one day to charge his iPod and haggle with the shop owner. Carnegie wants Eli's book, and will stop at nothing to get it. Unfortunately for him, Eli is practically Zatoichi when it comes to swordplay, and easily dispatches Carnegie's men with his makeshift machete, and is even better with a gun. But Carnegie is relentless, and continues to hunt down Eli.While the plot itself isn't anything special, the style of the movie is. Rarely do I notice the cinematography in movies, but I noticed it within the first 10 minutes here. The wasteland is gorgeous, as weird as that may sound, and if there were more footage of Eli wandering around in it, I would've been ok with that. The fight scenes are all great- not too long and not too short. Another Fallout 3 connection I saw here was that in the game, you can use VATS (Vault-Tec Assisted Targeting System) to target the enemy's body parts, and get an easy kill/dismemberment that way. I swear, Eli used VATS for all of his kills, because he took out everyone in the same way you would in Fallout 3- precise targeting. There's a big twist near the end of the movie, though I did see it coming when I figured something out about Eli early on that most people didn't, but it's still a great touch, and I had a huge stupid smile on my face when it was revealed. Of course the book he's carrying is obviously The Bible, as you see shots of the cover several times before the halfway point, but I won't say any more about it so that the ending isn't ruined. As I said earlier, I didn't find the movie to be 'preachy' at all, and that's because this is a movie about religion- it doesn't try to be something else, and then throw in a forced message at the last minute. But at the same time, you could've replaced the Bible with any other religious book, and it would've been fine or given the same message. Eli is a man of god, and given how great he is in action, you have to wonder if he hasn't been blessed in some way. But trust me when I say that the movie isn't boring. While it is inspirational, there's plenty of action to go around, including a great scene with an elderly couple, and Eli making good use of his bow and arrow on some thugs. The action is fun, plain and simple. The ONLY bad thing I say is about the immediate ending- the last couple of minutes before the credits roll. I actually said ""you gotta be kidding me"" out loud when it happened, and if I were reviewing just the movie on its own, it'd get 3.5 stars. Had they not gone that route, this would be an easy 4 star movie in my book.The picture quality on the blu-ray is very good for what it is. The look of the movie is very washed out, with lots of greys, browns and -very- deep blacks. Even with the muted look, details are sharp, and the movie is beautiful to look at. The audio's even better, making excellent use of the DTS-HD Master Audio track. Sandstorms and the sound of wind blowing by are constant, gunshots explode around you, and dialogue is perfectly balanced with everything else, so nothing sounds too loud or quiet compared to whatever else is going on. Very nice work here. There are also 5.1 Spanish and French tracks, as well as subtitles in English, Spanish and French.As for the extras, The Book of Eli doesn't disappoint here either. Maximum Movie Mode is here, allowing you to watch the movie with picture-in-picture of storyboards and concept art for their matching scenes. It's very cool, and makes me wish there were an art book for the movie so I could have an easier time looking at everything! You also get 10 Focus Points, which are featurettes on different aspects of making the movie like weapons, stunts, design and more. Basically, everything you'd get on a commentary track is in these two features right here. There's an animated comic, A Lost Tale, that runs for about 5 minutes and kind of shows what made Carnegie the man he is in the movie. I didn't care for the animation, and there isn't much to it when it comes down to it, but it's still nice to have. Rounding out the extras are a quick featurette on the movie's soundtrack, a few minutes of deleted/alternate scenes (nothing important here) and two good featurettes: one about the rise and fall of civilizations and rebuilding society, and a basic featurette going over the making of the movie (script/filming).Overall, this is a great blu-ray, and if it weren't for that head shakingly bad ending, I would've given this 5 stars. The Book of Eli is one of the better post-apocalyptic movies out there (especially since it doesn't ruin anything by cramming zombies into the mix), and I'd put close to the same level as A Boy & His Dog. Heck, have a movie night with those two and enjoy some Fallout 3 when everything's over. Have an ice cold Nuka-Cola, and you've got a friday night right there.",4,Fallout 3: The Movie.,1289606400,"11 13, 2010",2010,6525,"['was', 'hesitant', 'watch', 'Book', 'Eli', 'while', 'mixed',

It's about a man who has invincible (or rather, nearly invincible) super powers as a result of a book he carries around with him everywhere he goes.He also contains super human strengths apparently, whether because of the book or just because the movie writers needed to make something exciting happen in order to entertain the viewers- I don't necessarily know which one it is.Anyway, he travels across deserted lands telling everyone he meets that he's travelling west, until he ends up coming across a group of power hungry smalltown thugs who would like nothing more than to take the book away from him once they discover he's carrying it.The entire storyline consists of the man trying his very best to protect the book and keep it away from those who don't know how to handle its power.I really like the gloomy setting that takes place throughout the movie.  It's always exceptionally bleak and succeeds in delivering the scenery of a post-apocalyptic world perfectly.  The grey clouds, the eerie silence, the emptiness... just a frighteningly realistic scenario.The acting is pretty good for the most part, however my only complaint is that the storyline wasn't strong enough to keep me attached.  There's only so much you can talk about when the storyline pertains to protecting a book with special abilities.However some of the shooting and fighting segments were really good, my favorite being the shoot-out at the one house resulting in a portion of the house literally being blown apart.

1310781,A30TQET02FLSUX,B002ZG997C,BLACKBOXBLUE,"[2, 6]","One of the most stunning stylistic movies I've seen in years is The Book of Eli (2010), Denzel Washington's recent post-apocalyptic genre addition. Directors (and brothers) Albert and Allen Hughes have created one of the better films in this popular Hollywood genre, and clearly left their mark as talented filmmakers all over it. The loosely defined apocalypse genre is hard to categorize. It's usually a bit sci-fi, drama, thriller, and action. You've got films like The Terminator (1984), Terminator 2: Judgment Day (1991), and Twelve Monkeys (1995) that are mostly set in the time BEFORE the apocalyptic event they are about takes place. These films are about the attempt to prevent the apocalypse from happening. Then you've got the films that are basically set DURING the apocalyptic event, like Deep Impact (1998), Armageddon (1998), and The Seventh Sign (1988), where everyone's efforts to prevent the disaster ultimately fail. And finally you have films set AFTER the apocalyptic event where it's all about the survival in this new reality, like Waterworld (1995), The Postman (1997), The Matrix (1999), Planet of the Apes (1968), and The Road (2009). The Book of Eli fits into the latter category of movies after the apocalypse, where people are forced to deal with a new, usually dark and twisted, world.Set in what is assumed to be the desert Southwest of the United States, The Book of Eli is a pretty simple story about a man named Eli whose sole purpose in life is to guard one of the last books left in the world and take it on its journey to its final destination, revealed through the course of the movie. After the apocalypse, there was a manic fever of book burning and destruction that basically rid the world of books and literacy, all in an attempt to control the remaining people who survived whatever happened to cause this apocalypse. The film doesn't go in to the cause of this new post-apocalyptic world, but instead focuses on how society keeps its shared historical knowledge alive in the context of complete brutal survival.I recently saw The Book of Eli for the first time in HD on HBO. What a stellar presentation I must say! I'm wishing now that I had seen the film in the theater on the big screen. The Book of Eli is absolutely fantastic looking! The cinematography, production design, costumes, and make-up are really well designed and executed. My friend Siobhan Roome was a part of the Art Department for the film as a set designer, and she did her job very well...along with the rest of the art department team. Production Designer Gae S. Buckley and The Hughes Brothers gave this film a look and feel like no other and executed their vision with incredible craftsmanship.Director of Photography Don Burgess really showed off his talents with the cinematography as well. There were a few shots that simply blew my mind with their composition and camera movement. There's one shot in particular that made me pause and rewind because I just hadn't seen it before. It's a 90-degree rotated pan with the horizon running vertically within the widescreen presentation. I wish I had a shot of it to share, but its better to see it the context of the film anyways. The gritty gray, black, yellow, and brown tones of the film perfectly reflect the barren desert topography and apocalyptic atmosphere that the story is telling. Burgess and The Hughes Brothers really gave The Book of Eli visuals that I'll never forget and compare every future movie within this genre against.The original music for The Book of Eli by music composer Atticus Ross is really well-suited to the story and an excellent listen all on its own. I've listened to the soundtrack on its own several times since watching the movie. My favorite track is ""Panoramic"" and it's ""Eaten By Earth"" remix. Along with his work on The Social Network (2010), Ross had an incredible year in 2010. Now that I know that Ross was behind the music from the short-lived USA Network TV show Touching Evil (2004), which I thought was an awesome show unfairly cancelled, I'm even more enamored with him. I clearly remember the feeling of the haunting music from that show. And apparently Ross got his start in the business with that series. Ross has a very modern style in his sound that feels fresh and exciting. I'm really looking forward to his future work on David Fincher's upcoming remake of The Girl With The Dragon Tatoo (2011). He's been re-paired with Trent Reznor from The Social Network soundtrack, so the sound should be interesting to say the least.The plot and story of The Book of Eli was good. Like I said, it's a simple story, but well-executed by actors Denzel Washington, Gary Oldman, Mila Kunis and the rest of the supporting cast. Nobody's acting really stood out as superior within their careers, but they were all solid performances that served the story of the film. Oldman felt a bit like he was re-hashing his bad guy role from Air Force One (1997), but he is good playing a bad guy, especially with his heavily textured face. There were a few times during the film that I felt the pacing and plot weren't going anywhere and were just filling time. I think the film could've benefitted from a little more complexity in its plot and more focus on developing the emotional depth of the characters and how they got to where they are personally. Maybe more back story about their lives was needed. That being said, I still felt like there was enough depth to this story that it satisfied me. And combined with the amazing look and style of everything, I'm very much compelled to watch the film again on Blu-ray.I'm not going to give away the story, but I like the twist ending. I did not see it coming (no pun intended for those that have seen the film). But it worked for me even though I knew going in to the film what book Eli is protecting. I give The Book of Eli 3.5 stars out of 5. It's a very good movie that surprised me and gave me a very satisfying experience. One of the better films of 2010. The Hughes Brothers are talented directors that have their own unique vision as filmmakers and its pleasing to see them express it through their films. I'll definitely be curious to see what they do next.",4,Stunning Stylistic Film - One of the Best Movies of 2010 (3.5 stars),1297728000,"02 15, 2011",2011,6213,"['One', 'most', 'stunning',

Yes, the spurts of violence seem to clash with the overall message but even that aspect is covered by dialogue and a nicely crafted story.

A big point off for the premise that apparently led to the apocalyptic times depicted but that grim world does draw you in to the film completely. Taking entertainment to a thoughtful level is always good and this film succeeds at that remarkably well. It points out that it's critical to define what's really important in life.

While I felt Denzel was maybe a little less powerful in his role than usual, I know Gary Oldman was wasted as the balancing evil to Denzel's good. Both actors appeared to be lukewarm in their roles. Oldman can usually be a bad guy without any stretching but his role here was unfocused and his power over others was never defined. No clear goals. Without understanding why he had followers, it's hard to take him seriously. He had an increasing air of impotence that eventually had his world destroying itself around him in the end. There was never a clear idea of his power to start with so there is no sense of his loss.Denzel Washington is very talented when he is channeling the character's emotions and personality. Sadly, Eli had little personality. A bit too introverted and was so focused on the westward trek that he failed to let us into his mind. While Oldman's character targets Eli and fixates on mugging him for his King James Bible, Eli never really channels anything except selective, random compassion or grim determination.I like the movie.

1310794,A3QNQQKJTL76H0,B002ZG997C,buru buru piggu,"[1, 2]","As a fan of the post-apocalyptic film genre, I enjoyed The Book of Eli for its look, but felt that the story suffered as it went on. With bits ofBlade,I Am Legend,The Road Warrior / Mad Max Beyond Thunderdome,The Road, and a drop ofChildren of Menmixed in, Book of Eli is a slickly-produced film, with the requisite bleached out colors and monochromatic/desaturated look of the genre. Like The Road, an unexplained nuclear holocaust has wiped out civilization, mentioned only in passing. Once again, our hero must get from point A to point B, traveling a road fraught with difficulties and dangers. And he must do it on foot.Denzel is Eli, a loner and tough-as-nails survivalist tasked with delivering the last remaining x to a safe location. In Children of Men, it was the world's last pregnant woman. In Book of Eli, it's the last remaining copy of the King James Bible. He has been walking for thirty years. The film opens with a very cool sequence of Eli in the forest stalking a feral cat with a bow and arrow, instantly establishing his resourcefulness, marksmanship, and super-badness for the audience. Visually, it just looks fabulous the way the scene is designed and filmed in monochromatic cyan with detritus raining down. Eli speaks softly and carries a big knife. In fact, it's a very, very big knife and he makes expert use of it against the roving gangs of thieves and cut-throats he encounters, hacking off hands and limbs with style.Wesley Snipeswould be proud.The real trouble for Eli (and this film's story) begins when he stops off for supplies at a ramshackle town run by a ruthless man named Carnegie (Gary Oldman), who had been sending out search parties to scour the wasteland for the book. While Eli is a man of faith and cherishes the book as the key to humanity's salvation, Carnegie covets it for a very different reason: to control the masses and expand his influence to other towns. He tries to make a deal and Eli refuses. At this point, Eli is no longer a loner dependent on his wits and reflexes for survival. He picks up extra baggage in the form of an attractive, but altogether annoying and poorly-developed side-kick character (Mila Kunis) who he now has to protect. This is where the script gets sloppy. Instead of being a story of the cool, quiet, and self-reliant stranger who only has himself to look after, it now becomes the story of ""save the helpless girl from the bad-guys"" and running away from the gangsters.I enjoyed seeing details of Eli's survival techniques the most and how he copes with the dangers of the wasteland, but not enough of his back-story is given. That itself isn't the problem, because I'm plenty willing to enjoy a character's unexplained and mystery past and live in the here and now of his present situation, like Clint Eastwood's archetypal loner, the ""Man with No Name"" from theThe Man with No Name Trilogy (A Fistful of Dollars, For A Few Dollars More, The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly). The real problem is the irritating tag-along Eli picks up, which for me, ruins the story. Gary Oldman, an actor I respect and admire, underwhelms here. He has played plenty of excellent villains before (Agent Stansfield in Leon, Zorg in Fifth Element), but his portrayal here is lackluster, devoid of quirks, and mostly uninteresting. Also worth mentioning is the wasted potential of Ray Stevenson as Carnegie's lead henchman. He has no memorable lines or scenes and dies in a cheap and inglorious manner.The final segment of the journey is very similar to Children of Men, though I did not mind because what happens after he gets to his destination was a pleasant twist. The very ending quite obviously hints at a sequel possibility with someone taking up Eli's mantle.Unlike some viewers, I did not take this film to be a celebration of religion or a condemnation of it. The Bible is arguable the most important book in western civilization and a natural choice for a film's central plot device. The Book of Eli is not perfect, but it's worth a look if you liked any of the films I mentioned above.",4,"Spoiler-free review: An entertaining, but flawed post-apocalyptic adventure",1276992000,"06 20, 2010",2010,4060,"['fan', 'post-apocalyptic', 'film', 'genre', 'enjoyed', 'Book', 'Eli', 'look', 'felt', 'story', 'suffered', 'went', 'bits', 'ofBlade', 'Am', 'Legend', 'Road', 'Warrior', '/', 'Mad', 'Max', 'Beyond', 'Thunderdome', 'Road', 'drop', 'ofChildren', 'Menmixed', 'Book', 'Eli', 'slickly-produced', 'film', 'requisite', 'bleached', 'out', 'colors', 'monochromatic/desaturated', 'look', 'genre', 'Road', 'unexplained', 'nuclear', 'holocaust', 'wiped', 'out', 'civilization', 'mentioned', 'only', 'passing', 'Once', 'again', 'hero', 'must', 'get', 'point', 'point', 'B', 'traveling', 'road', 'fraught', 'difficulties', 'dangers', 'must', 'do', 'foot.Denzel', 'Eli', 'loner', 'tough-as-nails', 'survivalist', 'tasked', 'delivering', 'last', 'remaining', 'x', 'safe', 'location', 'Children', 'Men', 'was', 'world', 'last', 'pregnant', 'woman', 'Book', 'Eli', 'last', 'remaining', 'copy', 'King', 'James', 'Bible', 'been', 'walking', 'thirty', 'years', 'film', 'very', 'cool', 'sequence', 'Eli', 'forest', 'stalking', 'feral', 'cat', 'bow', 'arrow', 'instantly', 'establishing', 'resourcefulness', 'marksmanship', 'super-badness', 'audience', 'Visually', 'just', 'fabulous', 'way', 'scene', 'designed', 'filmed', 'monochromatic', 'cyan', 'detritus', 'raining', 'down', 'Eli', 'softly', 'big', 'knife', 'fact', 'very', 'very', 'big', 'knife', 'expert', 'use', 'roving', 'gangs', 'thieves', 'cut-throats', 'hacking', 'off', 'hands', 'limbs', 'style.Wesley', 'Snipeswould', 'be', 'proud.The', 'real', 'trouble', 'Eli', 'film', 'story', 'when', 'supplies', 'ramshackle', 'town', 'run', 'ruthless', 'man', 'named', 'Carnegie', 'Gary', 'Oldman', 'who', 'had', 'been', 'sending', 'search', 'parties', 'scour', 'wasteland', 'book', 'Eli', 'man', 'faith', 'book', 'key', 'humanity', 'salvation', 'Carnegie', 'very', 'different', 'reason', 'control', 'masses', 'expand', 'influence', 'other', 'towns', 'make', 'deal', 'Eli', 'point', 'Eli', 'no', 'longer', 'loner', 'dependent', 'wits', 'reflexes', 'survival', 'up', 'extra', 'baggage', 'form', 'attractive', 'altogether', 'annoying', 'poorly-developed', 'side-kick', 'character', 'Mila', 'Kunis', 'who', 'now', 'protect', 'where', 'script', 'sloppy', 'Instead', 'being', 'story', 'cool', 'quiet', 'self-reliant', 'stranger', 'who', 'only', 'look', 'now', 'story', 'save', 'helpless', 'girl', 'bad-guys', 'running', 'away', 'gangsters.I', 'enjoyed', 'seeing', 'details', 'Eli', 'survival', 'most', 'how', 'dangers', 'wasteland', 'not', 'enough', 'back-story', 'given', ""n't"", 'problem', ""'m"", 'plenty', 'willing', 'enjoy', 'character', 'unexplained', 'mystery', 'past', 'live', 'here', 'now', 'present', 'situation', 'Clint', 'Eastwood', 'archetypal', 'loner', 'Man', 'Name', 'theThe', 'Man', 'No', 'Name', 'Trilogy', 'Fistful', 'Dollars', 'A', 'Few', 'Dollars', 'More', 'Good', 'Bad', 'Ugly', 'real', 'problem', 'irritating', 'tag-along', 'Eli', 'up', 'story', 'Gary', 'Oldman', 'actor', 'respect', 'admire', 'underwhelms', 'here', 'played', 'plenty', 'excellent', 'villains', 'Agent', 'Stansfield', 'Leon', 'Zorg', 'Fifth', 'Element', 'portrayal', 'here', 'lackluster', 'devoid', 'quirks', 'mostly', 'uninteresting', 'Also', 'worth', 'mentioning', 'wasted', 'potential', 'Ray', 'Stevenson', 'Carnegie', 'lead', 'henchman', 'memorable', 'lines', 'scenes', 'dies', 'cheap', 'inglorious', 'manner.The', 'final', 'segment', 'journey', 'very', 'similar', 'Children', 'Men', 'did', 'not', 'mind', 'what', 'destination', 'was', 'pleasant', 'twist', 'very', 'ending', 'quite', 'obviously', 'hints', 'sequel', 'possibility', 'someone', 'taking', 'up', 'Eli', 'mantle.Unlike', 'viewers', 'did', 'not', 'take', 'film', 'be', 'celebration', 'religion', 'condemnation', 'Bible', 'arguable', 'most', 'important', 'book', 'western', 'civilization', 'natural', 'choice', 'film', 'central', 'plot', 'device', 'Book', 'Eli', 'not', 'perfect', 'look', 'liked', 'films', 'mentioned']",N/A

1310811,A1RZ8PKX49BCEE,B002ZG997C,Charlie Gee,"[0, 1]","Here, again, is another Denzel Washington movie that will have you thinking about it long after the viewing is done.  Denzel puts in a strong performance as the movie's lead, a character that echoes back to the ""man with no name"" type of hero made famous by Clint Eastwood.  Here in a post-apocalyptic world where the death of a feral cat mirrors the manner in which the survivors of nuclear devastation treat each other, the audience is immersed in a cold, stark world that is both repulsive and fascinating.  I couldn't stop watching the screen.  The bleached colors of the film serve to enhance the bleak nature of this new environment and the fantastic, often haunting, musical score truly adds to the eerie atmosphere.Gary Oldman, Ray Stevenson, Jennifer Beals, and Mila Kunis are well cast and demand your attention in their roles.  We also get some exciting action sequences, particularly the showdown that takes place at the home of a very eccentric couple (also well-played).  Thought-provoking, spiritual, frightening, and reflective, THE BOOK OF ELI is all these things and the movie is well worth the price of admission.This single-disc DVD comes with a couple of special features: deleted/additional scenes and an animated short called ""A Lost Tale: Billy"" which explores the background of Gary Oldman's character.

1310815,A18G7GG53G2X8A,B002ZG997C,Chris Pandolfi,"[3, 8]","One does not usually begin a movie review by talking about the ending, but in the case of ""The Book of Eli,"" there's really no other way to go about it. Something, and I'm trying to be careful here, is revealed, something that's implausible but also undeniably clever. After the revelation, we discover what has been driving the main character to do what he does, and that's when it all come crashing down - this movie goes a long way for very little. How could the Hughes Brothers have let their film be so grossly undermined, especially after giving the audience a thoroughly absorbing buildup? I'm so disappointed. This movie could have been something. Up until the end, it really was something.The story takes place in a post apocalyptic world of barren landscapes, effectively made to look harsh through a combination of overly bright lighting and muted color schemes. Broken highways trail across vast deserts. Cities lie in ruin. Ancient-looking cars litter the scenery, and some still contain the remains of their drivers. Drought reigns supreme. Everything is scarce, including food. The remaining population consists almost entirely of thieves, and some have even resorted to cannibalism. The reason for all this is left a little obscure; the characters keep referring to a cataclysmic event known as The Flash, which I interpret as being either a meteor or a solar flare. It also could have been manmade - a nuclear bomb, or something.Wandering across this wasteland is Eli (Denzel Washington), a loner on a mission. He has the fighting skills of an assassin, able to take on groups of people singlehandedly and emerge victorious, even when chainsaws and machineguns are involved. He seems astutely aware of his surroundings, and his sense of hearing is unbelievably strong. He has lightning-quick reflexes, as if somehow seeing everything before it actually happens. But he never makes it his business to fight; he's just trying to head west. He has been for the last thirty years, ever since The Flash took place. What exactly is waiting for him there? He's remains mum on the subject. I can't help but love it when the Mysterious Stranger lives up to his name.He makes a pit stop in a ramshackle town run by Carnegie (Gary Oldman), a wholly deplorable man who sends his flunkies out in search of a very specific book. No power on earth will make me reveal exactly what book it is. I will say that Eli just happens to be in possession of such a book and that, because of a social uprising soon after The Flash, it's the last of its kind. As a result, a select few know of its existence. Eli wants the book because he believes it will be the key to humanity's redemption. Carnegie wants the book because he can use it as a weapon. When all is explained at the end, we realize with great disillusionment that Carnegie's motives make a reasonable argument for why this book should have remained forgotten.But I'm getting ahead of myself. Eli bonds with Solara (Mila Kunis), daughter of Claudia (Jennifer Beals), Carnegie's blind concubine. Not much is known about Solara; the most we get is that, like many who were born after The Flash, she never learned how to read. But it's not really about getting to know her, anyway; it's about her relationship with Eli, the way she questions him about life before The Flash, why he's so intent on heading west, and whether or not he can teach her how to read. Eli is alarmingly unresponsive on the subject of reading, and we don't understand why until the end.And that brings me back to where I started. A mystery is only as good as its solution; if what leads up to the ending is better than the actual ending, you've failed at telling a successful story. The big revelation at the end of ""The Book of Eli"" is immensely unsatisfying, not only because it sends a message that contradicts certain events of the story, but also because it lacks the inventiveness and scope of the film's opening and middle sections. It was a bait and switch. I felt cheated.All the same, there are many recommendable things about this movie. The buildup is carefully structured and wonderfully paced. The visuals are stunning. The dialogue is decent. The performances are good, especially Oldman's. It's just the ending that's bad. This is a strange situation. I'm urging you to avoid ""The Book of Eli,"" but because my review has been so vague, seeing it may be the only way for you to understand where I'm coming from. I really wanted to like this film. Up until the final five minutes, I did like it very much. So maybe it would be worth your while to go and then leave before everything is revealed. In this case, that would not be a waste of money. Trust me on this one.",3,Where Are You Going?

If you have, then The Book of Eli is it. If you haven't - see it anyway. You'll be pleasantly surprised.The sensational Denzel Washington stars as Eli. He's a lonely drifter wondering the streets of a morally and economically abandoned America. After a great war that tore a hole in the sky and upset the balance of the sun, the world more or less came to an end.That was over 30 years ago and Eli has been walking ever since. He, like those few who survived, cannot go outside without shades on; as the sky has turned to a desolate burnt mass that will blind you. The brilliant filmmakers (Albert and Allen Hughes) who brought us From Hell; have crafted a very unique and appealing-to-the-cinematic-eye, landscape for Denzel's character to trek across.Eli has one mission: to protect a sacred book that he has in his possession, and to take it west. Faith is his employer; faith in the heavenly voice that has told him to do so.Please don't make the ignorant mistake that others have made by assuming that it has taken him 30 years to walk from A to B. His path has been unknown to him, as is all of ours in life, and those 30 years were spent with him learning from and experiencing things of which the film does not need to show us. Plus, his path leads him to a place where he interacts with certain characters that would not have been there 30 years ago or even 15 years ago, and he needs to meet them in order for his destiny to be fulfilled entirely.This is a very religious film, if you didn't pick up on it from the beginning of this review or from the advertising. Eli is being led by God, okay. I know it's a movie, but films of the past have asked us to accept much more unbelievable elements and we all have; so just go with it and have some fun.Eli is met along the way by sadistic motorcycle gangs and rapists and thieves; really bad guys. People butcher and slaughter one another for food, water, sex and whatever else you may have to offer them. Eli partakes in none of this, and handles those who oppose his goal appropriately to his situation and to the genre of this film - he kills them; violently, innovatively, and in very entertaining ways.If you are some-one who believes strongly that violence is never the answer, no matter what the situation, then skip this film and go watch Sesame Street instead. It's jam-packed with violence; justified violence. Let's face it - sometimes the only way to counter violence, is to retaliate with even more of it. That's a fact folks.Eventually Eli stumbles into a town run by a heinous dictator. Who better to play a grizzly villain, than the villain's villain himself: Gary Oldman. From Bram Stoker's Dracula and The Fifth Element, to True Romance and The Professional, Oldman has portrayed some of the most celebrated movie-psychotics of all time. He adds The Book of Eli to that list with another phenomenal performance as Carnegie.Carnegie is the guy you have seen a thousand times in different westerns; the bully who has taken over the town and has his own personal henchman, and is forcing a beautiful woman to be his love interest. But it's the sadistic charm that Oldman brings to this character that sets him apart from others. He is magnificent and terrifying.Carnegie's agenda is to get his hands on a sacred book that he believes will grant him power to rule everyone left alive on our miserable planet. The book is of course the one which Eli possesses.When Eli wonders into Carnegie's town for supplies, he finds some trouble. After a bloody battle is had, leaving Eli victorious, Carnegie is impressed with his skills and wishes to hire him as part of his crew. When Eli refuses, Carnegie grants him a free night in his hotel with a generous meal, in hopes of persuading him. Eli accepts the offer and stays the night.Jennifer Beals gives a terrific performance as Claudia, that woman being forced into Carnegie's life that we discussed earlier. Her daughter Solara (Mila Kunis) is forced to work in the saloon and sometimes provide sexual favors to guests. Carnegie forces her to offer herself to Eli, in one of the film's best and most enduring scenes.Obviously, Eli declines her gesture and befriends her instead. The two create a strong partnership and flee from Carnegie and his group of degenerate dirt-bags. Naturally they follow, and several interesting interactions are had before the film reaches its end.The violence in the film will no doubt confuse many, as that's all they will see it as. They will miss the fact that Eli is on a quest from God, and never once invites an altercation upon himself. Eli is always grief stricken or warn-down by his acts of violence and finds no pleasure in them.There is one scene in the film where he does kill an unarmed man, but I believe that he either does this because God tells him to, as the guy is evil and will murder others as he has just attempted to do to Eli; or he does this because of the simple fact that the man will bleed to death, in the middle of no-where, as a result of the injury he has sustained.You'll be impressed to know that Denzel did al of his own stunts in this film, and trained severely to make these action sequences look believable. They do.The Book of Eli also has one of the most original endings ever seen in any film; right up there with the shock-value of The Sixth Sense. Watching it a second time, makes it as equally painstakingly obvious with clues, but hardly anyone will ever catch it the first time around.It's good to see a big Hollywood-backed movie that evokes a strong Christian theme. You don't catch too many of those. Eli gives a terrific quote in the film that has and will continue to stick with me: ""There's always a choice.""",5,The Book of Eli Review,1273190400,"05 7, 2010",2010,6063,"['BOOK', 'OF',

All the bibles were destroyed after the war. He has the last one and he has to fight this guy over this last bible. Other than the plot, the fighting scenes were the best I have ever seen in a movie.

1310826,A3TYC8T6W81DDB,B002ZG997C,C. Sawin,"[7, 11]","This wound up being better than expected. The first few trailers and TV spots were interesting as they completely avoided spoilers relating to the film. More recent TV spots, ones that were being shown as recent as yesterday, pretty much spoil what the book actually is. You may have already been able to guess what particular book it is, but seeing everything unfold without any expectations or predictions is the best way to see the film. The Book of Eli seemed to be going in a direction that was predictable at times, but then went down an unexpected detour to end up at a completely separate destination. Without spoiling too much, the events that are revealed in the finale of the film make the entire experience worthwhile. What transpires in the last twenty minutes or so pretty much makes you want to watch the film again and solidifies the Eli character as a vagabond of the most ultimate caliber.Denzel Washington's portrayal of a man who's gotten so caught up in the mission that's been given to him that he's forgotten how it feels to interact with genuine people is nearly flawless. Well, that and the action scenes he's a part of are spectacular and incredibly exciting to watch. The rather underrated Gary Oldman does a fantastic job of making you hate his character, as well. Carnegie is so smarmy and selfish that you nearly jump for joy once the empire he's built begins to crumble. It was surprising, in a good way, to see Malcolm McDowell have a small part in the film. Although his character doesn't have much screen time, he still made a small impact. Tom Waits as the Engineer managed to have a few great scenes with Denzel Washington, as well. Mila Kunis didn't really offer anything new as far as her acting goes, but she fit the Solara role pretty well. Jennifer Beals seemed to be the weak link in the cast though. She has a scene with Gary Oldman where she begins to break down and start crying that just didn't feel up to par with the rest of the cast, but that could be classified as a nitpick.The Book of Eli is a great way to start the new year with a bang as far as moviegoing experiences go. The film's storyline is a bit reminiscent of films like Fahrenheit 451 and Equilibrium since all three films deal with book burning in a not too distant future. There's actually one scene near the end of the film where Eli and Solara are in a boat that brought Children of Men to mind, a trait that is purely meant as a compliment. The Book of Eli delivers a highly entertaining ride from beginning to end composed of strong performances from the cast, an enticing story, and a blindsided ending.

Then along comes The Book of Eli, which dares to take a reverential view of religious faith.The title character, forcefully portrayed by Denzel Washington, is a man on a mission. In a post-apocalyptic world in which many humans have become savages, many have become cannibals, Eli wants to save the sole remaining copy of a sacred text.The film is full of startling images of a devastated planet. The trappings of civilization are scattered about in shambles. People struggle to survive in a world without law and order. Vicious gangs prey on the weak.In the midst of it all, Eli is a moral man with a strict code of conduct. He has not descended into barbarism. And, possessing miraculous fighting skills, he will not let anything stand in his way.Mila Kunis skillfully portrays a young woman who joins Eli's quest.

1310831,AEQFYOI6YJ83Z,B002ZG997C,DanD,"[5, 7]","A post-apocalyptic action film with Denzel Washington as the hero and Gary Oldman as the villain, with Mila Kunis along for the requisite femme fatale role, and Tom Waits thrown in for good measure?  THE BOOK OF ELI had all the requirements to be a first-rate film, a stand-out in the genre.  Unfortunately, it isn't.  True, it has an interesting premise: a man (Eli) is traveling across the country, carrying the last remaining Bible (not really a spoiler; you kind of know it long before it's ""revealed"").  Simultaneously, an evil man named Carnegie (groan) is devouring all the books he gets, looking for that one...that holy one.  And when he meets Eli, and finds his book, he wants it.  Oh, he wants it.  The only thing he didn't plan on, though, is how much a** Eli can kick.I will give the film this much: it never quite drops the bottom out on you.  And the action is stylized; it's nice to see Denzel kicking butt and taking names.  And Oldman shines in an otherwise cliched role.  Mila Kunis should probably stick to comedy (remember MAX PAYNE?  Me neither), and it's kind of unsettling, having her be the sole attractive woman in the world.  The film has its flaws, far too many of them--most of it hinges on the script, which is just pathetic at times.

By now everyone knows what The Book is, and that it is desperately coveted by those who would wield it to control the surviving population, including Carnegie (a brooding Gary Oldman), the kingpin of a town splashed in the midst of desolation.  Thus THE BOOK OF ELI becomes a story of pursuit, with Washington making his way west (followed by young Solara, played by Mila Kunis), with Carnegie's henchmen on his trail.The story is told simply, the settings are compelling and believable, and Washington performs with a grace and dignity that is stunning.  Interspersed throughout the film are several memorable roles, including Jennifer Beals (playing Solara's blind mother), Ray Stevenson (as Redridge, Carnegie's lieutenant), Michael Gambon and Frances de la Tour (a cannibalistic couple armed to the max), and Malcolm McDowell (a scholar at the end of Eli's quest).  My only problem with THE BOOK OF ELI centers around the violent confrontations; suspension of disbelief becomes exceedingly difficult when Eli constantly battles hordes of thugs, mows them down like grass, and walks away unscathed.

People struggle to survive, cannibalism becomes common and there is no longer a United States of America.  In its place, small communities basically go back to being city states, and the roads are full of rogues & thieves.Denzel Washington plays a self-sufficient man who is able to take care of himself in spite of all the chaos that the world has descended into.  Books have been burned & most of the inhabitants of the planet are illiterate.This is  a well done movie, and you're always going to get top-notch performances from Denzel Washington, Gary Oldman and Malcom Macdowell.  There is one problem w/this film, however, and that's the simple fact that it's not a very good movie.  Frankly, I found it to be a yawner.  I kept hoping that the denouement would be profound & make up for everything leading up to it, but it just wasn't to be.  I felt like the ending of the movie was like waiting in line for 3 hours to see Mick Jagger only to be stuck with a Roseanne Barr concert instead.There is one demographic who will likely enjoy this film, and that would be far right-wing religious types.

1310855,A150HXN1PBL3C9,B002ZG997C,"Edward S. Brown ""Charisma Expert""","[1, 3]","""The Book of Eli"" is one of those mini-epics where the hero is regaled for his relentless quest to achieve one compelling aim in life.  Denzel Washington gives a great portrayal of Eli who is consumed with verbally recreating the last Holy Bible in the world into book form.  Denzel's mastery of martial arts and firearms comes off a bit uncoordinated, but you can appreciate and give dramatic license to the attempt.  ""The Book of Eli"" is reminiscent of ""V for Vendetta"" where the hero commits his life to destroying the tyranny of England, which has become a world power--once again.  The similarities are uncanny---the doting young woman who comes to worship the hero for his courage, consolidated power in the hands of one man, and a legacy reborn following the triumph and death of the hero.The ending of ""The Book of Eli"" did not have the grand finale of ""V,"" because it attempts to turn the disciple into a post hero---which is not a good idea.  Great heroes emerge from conditions average individuals take for granted. There is a level of sensitivity endemic in an individual who longs for and finds a life's calling, which is not easily transferable, no matter how inspirational.  The gift of remembrance and a commitment to excellence is the purist and most authentic homage one can give to the hero.  Hollywood, in all its glory, loves to tantalize audiences with the possibility of a series of characters who become ""Eli.""  If everyone could become Eli, where is the specialness?I recommend watching ""The Book of Eli"" and ""V for Vendetta"" to embrace and celebrate the possibilities of the human spirit.Edward BrownCore Edge Image & Charisma Institute",4,"Homage to ""V for Vendetta""",1279497600,"07 19, 2010",2010,1662,"['Book', 'Eli', 'one', 'mini-epics', 'where', 'hero', 'regaled', 'relentless', 'quest', 'achieve', 'one', 'compelling', 'aim', 'life', 'Denzel', 'Washington', 'great', 'portrayal', 'Eli', 'who', 'consumed', 'verbally', 'recreating', 'last', 'Holy', 'Bible', 'world', 'book', 'form', 'Denzel', 'mastery', 'martial', 'arts', 'firearms', 'bit', 'uncoordinated', 'can', 'appreciate', 'give', 'dramatic', 'license', 'attempt', 'Book', 'Eli', 'reminiscent', 'V', 'Vendetta', 'where', 'hero', 'life', 'destroying', 'tyranny', 'England', 'become', 'world', 'power', 'once', 'again', 'similarities', 'are', 'uncanny', '-the', 'doting', 'young', 'woman', 'who', 'worship', 'hero', 'courage', 'consolidated', 'power', 'hands', 'one', 'man', 'legacy', 'reborn', 'following', 'triumph', 'death', 'hero.The', 'ending', 'Book', 'Eli', 'did', 'not', 'have', 'grand', 'finale', 'V', 'turn', 'disciple', 'post', 'hero', 'not', 'good', 'idea', 'Great', 'heroes', 'emerge', 'conditions', 'average', 'individuals', 'take', 'granted', 'level', 'sensitivity', 'endemic', 'individual', 'who', 'life', 'calling', 'not', 'easily', 'transferable', 'matter', 'how', 'inspirational', 'gift', 'remembrance', 'commitment', 'excellence', 'purist', 'most', 'authentic', 'homage', 'one', 'can', 'give', 'hero', 'Hollywood', 'glory', 'tantalize', 'audiences', 'possibility', 'series', 'characters', 'who', 'become', 'Eli', 'everyone', 'could', 'become', 'Eli', 'where', 'specialness', 'recommend', 'watching', 'Book', 'Eli', 'V', 'Vendetta', 'embrace', 'celebrate', 'possibilities', 'human', 'spirit.Edward', 'BrownCore', 'Edge', 'Image', 'Charisma', 'Institute']",N/A
1310856,A34GZPHWYPSY2T,B002ZG997C,"E. Hernandez ""Call me Harry""","[5, 10]","MAJOR, MAJOR SPOILER ALERT, BUT IT'S WAY DOWN LOW....""If you plan on seeing this movie, do not tell anyone....""-Roger Ebert, reviewOne can never watch post-apocalyptics without reference to the MAD MAX series, THE POSTMAN, and others I have mentioned in other reviews. People in these worlds are either sci-fi cannibals, communists or anarchist psychopaths.In the first 20 minutes of THE BOOK OF ELI I saw all that and more. Looked awfully familiar. Nearly put me off watching it through...but something kept nagging me, saying this was different. How right that nag was! It even lulled me into thinking the film would be 100% predictable.It is not.For those too young to appreciate all the films that are paid homage here, it is useless for me to mention any other than what I already did above. In brief: Eli (Denzel Washington, man, what a superhero) is a ""walker"", a wanderer through a post-apocalyptic world. His mission is to ""go west""--and he carries sacred cargo: a Bible, King James Version, the last in the world. We learn from Eli that ""after the flash, they were all burned"", because many believed the Bible ""caused"" the ""flash"". Apparently, it tore most of the ozone away also.Eli demonstrates some survival skills apparently taught to him straight from heaven. In fact, that will be part of my spoiler...be warned. He wanders into a town looking for a recharge for his music storage unit, which is identified as a Fathom 900, not seen since the 1990s. Since I don't know, I'll take the movie's word for it (or rather Tom Waits, who plays the shopkeeper/repairman).Eli encounters Carnegie (Gary Oldman), a sort of Boss Tweed if you can call him that--actually a rotten gang leader who has everyone else do his dirty work. He does not match THE POSTMAN's General Bethlehem, but then, he is a different sort of chap. He discovers Eli has a...THE...Bible. He wants it. At any cost.So far this film is really quite fun with all its homages and one suddenly sees it is purely a kung fu film married to Clint Eastwood's man with no name. But wait! There's more!After becoming entangled with young Solara (the wonderful Mila Kunis) and her blind mother Claudia (a great turn by Jennifer Beals, still beautiful as ever), Eli continues west. Solara follows him, so he has no choice but to let her tag along...shades of Zatoichi, anyone?But wait, there's still more!! After a hilarious visit with cannibals George (Sir Michael Gambon) and his wife Martha (Frances de la Tour) and fighting off Carnegie's pursuit, after some atmospheric K-PAX style music and some sagging monochromatic moments, yet with the best cinematography I've seen in years, Eli and Solara find their way to San Francisco. They are bound for Alcatraz, apparently the place to which God told Eli he must go.Eli has been shot in the belly by Carnegie, but he has the strength to go onward. He has already been forced to give Carnegie the Bible, which is kept locked. Eli is dying, on the way to Alcatraz, and Carnegie has the Bible. You THINK you know what's coming, eh?== SPOILER WARNING ==Carnegie finds he needs Claudia more than ever...because the Bible is in Braille. Eli, it transpires, is blind.Even to the end of the film, it isn't overtly stated, but it is there for those who will notice it. Then the film rushes back into your memory...didn't he see this?...didn't he notice that?...but a blind person could do all those things. It was always vital that no one know Eli was blind. He must have been blinded in the flash or by the sun afterwards.Arriving at Alcatraz, he finds a cultural center which he of course mistakes for a museum (THE POSTMAN homage again). The curator, Lombardi--a great uncredited cameo by Malcolm McDowell--tells Eli they are preserving humanity in order to redistribute it again. In a homage to FARENHEIT 451, Eli tells Lombardi to take a pen and write his dictation. He then dictates the Bible perfectly.As Eli lay dying, finishing his dictation, he is ritually shaved and enrobed in what appears to be a Muslim priest's robe (this is the 2nd reference to Eli being some kind of Middle Eastern Christian; the 1st reference is his Arabic scarf which he trades for water). I cannot figure this part out at all, but it's clear Eli is some kind of post-apocalyptic priest and blind. It was odd because very early we see nestled in his backpack a name tag: ""Hi My name is ELI"", it says beneath a K-Mart-type logo. In the end, his 'successor' is Solara, who wanders back out as Eli once wandered. She even takes his sword-machete.This film is a ZATOICHI remake after all!I love the power of the Bible in this film. As a theologian, it cuts to the chase: few know what the Bible is, let alone what it says. Even Eli has failed to grasp its context. It has caused trouble before: Carnegie recalls when humankind was enslaved by evildoers using the Bible...which is what he wants to do. The Bible tells us that no one else can even comprehend who Eli is. A simple man, yet the most important man on earth, martyred but not before his job is done.Early in the film, Carnegie gets what he says is ""the last shampoo on earth"" for his blind girlfriend. I was moved that ELi is the last Christian on earth, albeit a shaky, self-guided one.Eli has the millennia-old set of books in his mind. That is the main power of which I speak. Eli gives the world, once again, the Bible. I love how it is finally printed and nestled in an Alcatraz shelf (showing it is from ""Alcatraz Press"") between Stone's TANAKH (that is the Jewish/Hebrew Bible--I own one of those) and the Holy Qu'uran. This film is full of such details and savory cinematic moments. Then again, I wondered at the sad fact that they printed the King James Bible and shelved it. No one read it and I didn't see copies being distributed. How sad.And as I said, it is a remake of the ZATOICHI films, and it takes a lot from those incomparable films of the 1960s. See it. Buy it. Do not blink, even during the sagging moments, because that is when Denzel shows the acting he learned from Shintaro Katsu, the original Zatoichi. Don't miss the sword moves, again copied directly from Ichi movies.Most of all, don't miss the true message and symbolism of the Bible this film offers. You can be an atheist and appreciate it.",5,The longest review you'll ever read--SPOILERS!!,1277424000,"06 25, 2010",2010,6272,"['MAJOR', 'MAJOR', 'SPOILER', 'ALERT', 'BUT', 'IT', 'WAY', 'DOWN',

I liked the actors in ""The Book of Eli"", and I liked the visually-interesting scenery.However, I did not care for the somewhat murky, predictable, and largely mis-conceived story.The notion that the Bible can offer a very small-time thug the means to subjugate an illiterate population in a post-apocalytic world where fewer than 1 in 10,000 have survived is Marxist Hollywood crap.The notion that God would annoint someone to save a Bible with a message framed in late-middle English instead of bringing forth the next Krishna, Buddha, or Christ to reassert the Truth for a post-apocalyptic time and place is equally improbable.Finally, the idea that the lead character is both blind and able to hit multiple moving targets at great distance (for a hand gun) while on the run (and otherwise behave like a sighted person in every scene) is far less likely than the alternative: Eli either knew or found a way to learn braille in order to read the book he was given by God, and called to read. Yes, it could be a Christian miracle in which Eli was without sight but given an even more powerful sense by God.If pressed, I'm willing to buy both this interpretation and its effectiveness in making it clear that Eli was chosen by God, annointed, etc. But if so, why not jam or mis-fire the round that finally brings Eli to his knees? To show that ""God works (or chooses not to work) in mysterious ways?"" To make the point that God is capricious, unpredictable, or unreliable? Either way, this is murky story-telling that only reinforces the audience's murky understanding of the murky Judeo-Christian concept of God... murky indeed.I really like the notion of depicting a spiritually-uplifted, empowered individual in a post-apocalyptic world. However, in my opinion, this film did not deliver that to anyone who knows and routinely experience the Indwelling Spirit of God. However, it may deliver a vague sense of what Christian religionists and non-religious individuals raised in a post-Christian era might imagine spirituality to be... sad really.After 24 hours' reflection and a long walk, I add this: Buried deep in this film is an useful truth, the telling of which redeems much: ""We live in a time of such abundance and yet we remain impoverished in knowing the difference between what is precious and what is not.""

1310865,A1CHM200OEN65X,B002ZG997C,"Eric Wilson ""novelist""","[4, 6]","The music is haunting, the landscape stark, and the action sparse yet violent. Wandering through this wasteland, Denzel Washington is Eli, a machete-wielding stoic on a mission to carry a mysterious book to safety in the west. He travels alone. He encounters marauders and cannibals. ""Stay on the path . . . it's not my concern"" is the mantra running through his head, as he maneuvers this post-apocalyptic obstacle course.Carnegie is the man standing in his way. Carnegie, played by Gary Oldham with a fine balance between restraint and melodrama, is the self-appointed mayor of an outlaw town, where people barter for food and water, where terror rules. Carnegie is old enough to remember the days before the war that destroyed life as we know it, and he understands the power of one book to shape and manipulate the masses to his will. He calls this religious book ""a weapon,"" but he intends to use it for his own purposes. Eli, on the other hand, wants to use this weapon for good, just as he uses his machete to divvy out his own forms of righteous judgment. Along the way, he finds a friend in Solara, a young woman wanting to escape the madness of Carnegie's town, but only toward the end of the story does Eli realize that his own preoccupation with saving the book has blinded him to its central messages of love and self-sacrifice.The movie plods forward just as Eli does, step by step, slowly, methodically, but with purpose and faith. Some have called that boring, whereas I appreciated directors who treated us with respect and allowed us time to care about the characters and think over the themes. What may seem heavy-handed the first time through becomes more subtle and intriguing when watching again. There are layers to this story that move me emotionally. It's not a perfect film, but it's one that has the courage to pursue a purpose and do so artistically.I saw it in theaters, bought the DVD, and added the soundtrack to my wish list.

Talk about two movies that go together. Agora had Christians burning books and starting the Dark Ages. This movie went the other way, with one champion, whose body is burned and scarred after an apocalypse, seems like he may be protected on High, or is he? Watch Agora first, you'll appreciate this film more.I had heard this movie was religious fodder for the evangelical set. I was glad and even shocked to see this wasn't the case. Actually, the villian played beautifully by Gary Oldman, was the Evangelical Power Player. I feel the movie makes clear, that his power is largely derived from literacy, which the townsfolk don't have, but he does. (Reminds me of a line from the once banned Gospel of Phillip) ""Ignorance is the mother of all evil"".Eli, played by Denzil Washington provides action and beyond pragmatic sensiblility. This film leaves me guessing about Eli seeming supernatural nature. Whats more, Eli, is the proverbial, pray in a closet guy. His lack of religious bombast was refreshing.At the end, we know what he is about. We also learn that no book, no matter our bias and prejudice, whether its the Bible, the Koran or the pages of Hustler should be burned or banned, and we must protect our literary heritage because it tells our posterity who we were, and what we were thinking and feeling at the time.The Post-Apocalyptic genre isn't my thing, so I deduct a point for that.

1310871,A2KW2KWKABNYNO,B002ZG997C,"Flap Jackson ""Sky Is Burning, But At Least We...","[2, 6]","Walking into The Book of Eli, I didn't really know what to expect aside from the fact that it's set in a depressing post-apocalyptic wasteland, and it features Denzel wielding a big knife and doing cool things with it. If that's all the movie had been, I probably would have been more or less entertained by it. But no, the movie goes above and beyond the call of duty, and for a movie about a book, it's a pretty solid film.What stuck me most about this film is probably the unique direction and world-building the film does. It's never really told what caused this apocalypse, but this post-apocalyptic world is kind of a beautiful world. The color has a very distinct tone to it, and even though the film mostly takes place in the California desert, the landscape seems very alive and striking. Watching Denzel just walk in front of a broken interstate towering above him is just a cool visual. And since the world is set 30 years after the apocalypse, everything looks it. Roads have a cracked, but dry quality. Cars are rusted, the paint on houses are peeling, and door hinges easily give way. Also, the world, at least as it shows, show society as reverted back to Western times. It's not really overt, but there's certainly the distinct feel of it in the scenes of the town. In fact, my biggest problem with the movie is that they didn't go deeper into the world. I want to know what it was like before. What was Denzel like before all this happened. Was he in the condition that he was in before it happened? You can see a K-Mart name tag with Eli's name on it at one point, but other than that, the movie is very specific in its scope. I just loved what they did with it so much, I wanted to see more of it.Also, I've never see The Hughes Brothers at work before, but they have a great visual style. And it's not just the color either. It's the shadows, how they light the fight sequences, the camera angles, what you can hear, when you can hear it, and how it's emphasized. I usually don't notice these technical details when I'm watching a film, but Eli certainly makes it stand out, for the better I think. Certainly, all the crew have promise, and I hope to see great things from them in the future. This includes a special shoutout to screenwriter Gary Whitta, who has never done a movie before this, but comes out with a splendid script for his first effort.But that isn't to say the movie is perfect. I could predict about 75% of the plot fairly easily, and I didn't have much love/use for Mila Kunis until she started blowing crap up. Still, by the end of the movie, they had convinced me that Meg Griffin could in fact be a believable bad-ass. There I said it. I thought it was impossible, but Eli showed me otherwise. Speaking of which...Denzel really is one of the, if not the highlight of the movie as the mysterious, but still thoroughly bad-ass Eli, who has a penchant for cutting off heads with a very sharp blade in the shadows. But it's not just the blade, as Eli is also impressive with a gun. Denzel pulls all the aspects of the character off with ease and coolness, while still being wise as all get out. Also, Gary Oldman is back in full form, channeling the slimy villainy he ruled over in the 90s. The character is a bit too serious, but Oldman makes the best out of the character.And then there's the end. A lot of people won't like it, but I like how it isn't the typical ending you'd expect from a movie like this. Is it believable? It's certainly a leap, but it works for Denzel's character, and makes him an even greater character.

The first ten or so minutes show us Denzel Washington as Eli, traveling alone and hunting through a bleak, gray wasteland, carrying the world's last Bible westward to safety based on a message from God.  And those first ten or so minutes show how fascinating movies can be with little or no dialogue (or, in this case, monologue).  As the story progresses, Eli encounters various jittery roadside bandits, who capture, kill and eat passersby . . . unless that passerby is Eli, of course, who has lightning-like reflexes and is handy with bows and arrows, machetes and guns.Roughly an hour into the movie, Eli comes upon a fairly well-established town run by Carnegie (actor Gary Oldman) and his henchmen, led by the &#34;Rome&#34; series' Ray Stevenson.  Carnegie is looking for the very book that Eli is carrying, for Carnegie recalls its power to sway men, et cetera et cetera et cetera.  While the story still has quite a bit of steam going at this point, it does turn into a bit of standard one-man-versus-many action fare with a few unexplained plot holes I won't explore here.

In the Road, they are heading south, just to get warm, while in this movie, Eli (Denzil Washington) is heading West, to deliver his book. While both are post-apocalyptic films, The Book of Eli is much more well defined, and the objective is clear and attainable. Also, the feeling of despair is not heavily relied upon in the Book of Eli.Overview:30 years ago, just after the last big war, Eli commenced his journey west to safely deliver his book. He survives by killing small animals and bartering things that he salvages. Eli has a very calm, unassuming disposition, but is extremely capable when it comes to defending himself. Every night, he quietly reads his book and prays.Cinematics:This film captures quite well the vastness and the emptiness of the land. You get the feeling that the land is now mainly desolate, apart from a few pockets where the survivors now inhabit.The tempo in this film changes rapidly, one moment there is calm and the next its calamity. The fight sequences are as pretty fast. Eli delivers strong measured responses depending upon the threat. The presentation is seamless and it is a very enjoyable action film.Conclusion:This is a very enjoyable action film. While, Eli is a very good fighter, he is still only one man, and not invincible. This aspect is also well captured. Thanks to Solara (Mila Kunis) he is able to continue his journey.

SD DVDs of first run movies normally run 4.5 to 6.6 GB.  In order to include the digital copy of this movie on the DVD, Warner Bros. technicians reduced the size of the SD DVD movie to a very low 3.35 GB, for a movie with a reduced color palette that needs every bit of video data to look presentable.  The Blu-ray version looks fine, even if it takes forever to load, as you watch a time icon on the screen as the picture boots up.The SD version includes the digital copy of the movie, something I can do without.  It is near impossible to watch the SD version on your computer, since the disc is programmed to go into the digital copy installation mode first.With this combo-pack, Warner Bros. makes Walt Disney Blu-ray/DVD packages look good.  Walt Disney does not rip you off by selling you a reduced data DVD, even of it does load up the DVD with tons of coming attractions.  I thought I was getting a bargain, a Blu-ray for $25 that included the $17 SD version of the movie.

Wow, it took a few minutes before it sunk in and I really loved this movie. The almost sepia-toned picture and ambient soundtrack might seem ""bland"" but it really works well. I also like that the movie doesn't hit you over the head with what's going on. It's subtle and despite the partial spoiler about the book (hey, the product description has it so I went with it) there's still another surprise which adds to the discovery.And, despite knowing what happens, my subsequent runs through (yes, I liked it that much) were still just as enjoyable. Great actors, beautiful scenes (despite it being desolate), beautiful ambient soundtrack, and a great story really make this movie worth adding to my collection.And, even though it doesn't seem to be in the description or title of the product, this Blu-Ray turned out to be a combo pack including a DVD and a digital copy (though supposedly the digital copy expires June 11, 2011 which is ridiculous).

I actually went to the theatre to see ""Avatar"" (like everyone else in the state that day) and decided to see the Book of Eli since Avatar was sold out. I'm glad that I did.The Book of Eli is an amazing film for many reasons, mainly because it handles its religious themes with a intelligence and an even hand. This is NOT an action film - that is the mistake; the movie is a religious fable but not a heavy-handed fire-and-brimstone manner.Denzel Washington stars as Eli, a man on a cross country mission in a post-apocolyptic America. People have resorted to cannibalism to survive. While Eli stops by a small relatively civilized town, he is confronted by the film's villain played by Gary Oldman who is the leader of the town. He has been searching the countryside, looking for a special book, the book that Eli has pledged to carry across the country. The film revolves around Eli's escape from the town, with a young girl in tow, and his journey across the country.So that is the basic plot. There is a ""surprise"" ending at the end, but there is more going on than just the basic plot. The power of faith, fake religious leaders, miracles and hope are themes that are explored in this film in a very intelligent and effective manner. The Book of Eli can appeal not on the Christians, but the ideas in this movie can speak to people of any faith - or no faith. Its a very positive movie.Its amazing that this movie was made, it really struck me on a deep emotional level.

Had a satisfying ending, general humanistic and related to that/in that way, some christian themes, etc. But this is woven into a good action plot. I'd call it a thoughtful action movie - nonthinkers and thinkers alike would enjoy it if they like action movies at all.Good acting, particularly the key characters. Didn't glorify evil strength as the only way to ultimately survive (to the contrary), nor did it overly sensationalize or exaggerate the violence of the fight scenes, which were filmed with a more b&w; palette than other scenes, perhaps to portray that life is at these times a very ugly and harsh reality.Film starts out with Denzel walking westwards in post-apocolyptic future (in barren desert, as usual). Fight scene style is sort of a mashup of ""private ryan"" flavor blended with street/martial fighting choreography - so though it's rough, hurray, it's not the dumb comic-book quentin tarentino style. Though we aren't sure right away, little things before and after show us he's a decent guy under the badass. What is not answered is how how did he became so resilient, and how did he learn to be so competent a figher? (like clint eastwood's ""pale rider""). There's the usual bad guys abusing people and resources along the way, and he gets to save a few lives. Due to attention to detail, the story is credibly done (for this genre); and not overly romanticized or glam. For some reason all the bibles were hunted down and burned (shades of fahrenheit 451). Note the map on the wall behind villain's desk. It's always interesting how denzel's character reacts, what he says. Also interesting that we see seeds of the human need of little beauty and spiritual in a few others when exposed to what denzel's character says as a decent person or quotes from the bible. The villain misses the book of eli but wants it for power, and denzel needs to bring it to where will be used for good.

You will see many killings [see previews] throughout the movie which is actually justified because it is always done in self defense.  But, I was very disappointed with the ending because here was an opportunity, though a fantasy, to reduce considerably the teaching of terrorism and direct hatred towards certain religions from a god or God.  Instead, the movie equates all major religions as being peaceful and necessary - a fallacy.  If you compare the religions today [please don't build straw men by citing offenses over 100 years old] and see the movie, you too will see the stupidity of the ending and why some of us were left with an empty feeling.

All four movies deal with some sort of ""end of the world as we know it"" theme(I'm guessing The Tooth Fairy does, since Dwayne Johnson in ballet tights sounds to be in line with rivers turning to blood and locust swarms).I can only guess that the reason is to say to the audience, ""Aw, you can't buy a new car after 2 years? Well, it could be worse."" Personally, I'd rather laugh at a decent comedy, but to each their own.The Book of Eli takes place about 30 years after a massive war broke out upon the earth. Nuclear warfare apparently destroyed the ozone layer, and anyone taking a leisurely stroll in the park or walking their dog was burnt to a crisp. The lucky ones, who were inside watching Jerry Springer, survived, and did what they could to continue surviving for about a year, when they were finally able to go out into a barren wasteland the likes of the video game Fallout 3. At least, that's what ""Walker""(Denzel Washington) tells us, along with some reflective Christian teachings and an anecdote about being wasteful and having more than you need.Walker is a man who has been walking for over 30 years across the remaining United States of America to deliver a bible out west. The actual place he needs to go is unknown. All Walker knows is that he'll have a feeling when he arrives. Why it takes him 30 years to walk across the USA is something you learn later.In his travels he forages for food and water, fights off ambush parties, listens to his iPod, and reads the bible. He comes across a town run by Gary Oldman, who has been searching for a bible to help control his little town. Obviously, Walker isn't going to give it up without a fight, because then there would hardly be any movie to watch.So what's good about this movie? Well, the scenery is awesome. Anyone who played the video game Fallout 3 will feel quite at home with the landscapes. It's almost as if images were lifted from the game and shot live-action, begging for a live-action movie of its own.The depiction of life post-apocalyptica is interesting, as well. Of course, we've seen most of this before in the Mad Max series, but it is thought-provoking just the same.Denzel Washington and Gary Oldman do a great job with what they are given as characters. Anyone less would have probably made me walk out of this film. Sadly, there is only so much that talented actors can do to keep a film above water. Mila Kunis is good eye candy, especially in a movie where most people have weird growths coming out of their faces. The rest of the movie just gets drawn out and annoying.For one, the ""twist""(for spoiler-free purposes) of Walker is aggravating. If you look back on the movie, you can understand why he does certain things because of this twist, but at the same time there are other elements and shots that don't make sense. It seems that half the time, the director is fighting between storyline and scenery. Obviously, scenery kept on winning, making the movie pretty shallow.The religious theme also irked me, but not as much as I'd thought. While Gary Oldman's interpretation as the Devil incarnate was fantastic, the use of theology to explain away how Walker keeps on trucking is tired and uninteresting. Granted, it's hard to do the movie without the book of Eli, but with the human side of Walker coming only at the very, very end, it's hard to take the religious overtones seriously.In the end, I give this movie 2 out of 5 Pip-Boy 3000s.",2,Apocalyptic Snooze-Fest,1283126400,"08 30, 2010",2010,4031,"['Earth', 'post-apocalypse', 'radiation', 'poisoning', 'Denzel', 'Washington', 'Gary', 'Oldman', 'cannibals', 'How', 'can', 'movie', 'go', 'wrong', 'elements', 'Book', 'Eli', 'shows', 'how.', 'end', 'world', 'know', 'such', 'morbid', 'topic', 'yet', 'pop', 'culture', 'so', 'tightly', 'also', 'seem', 'embrace', 'Jersey', 'Shore', 'conspiracy', 'theories', 'same', 'fervor', ""n't"", 'seem', 'as', 'saturated', 'past', '6', 'months', 'have', 'had', 'opportunity', 'see', '2012', 'Legion', 'Tooth', 'Fairy', 'topic', 'film', 'Book', 'Eli', 'four', 'movies', 'deal', 'sort', 'end', 'world', 'know', 'theme', ""'m"", 'guessing', 'Tooth', 'Fairy', 'Dwayne', 'Johnson', 'ballet', 'tights', 'be', 'line', 'rivers', 'turning', 'blood', 'locust', 'swarms', '.I', 'can', 'only', 'guess', 'reason', 'say', 'audience', 'Aw', 'ca', ""n't"", 'buy', 'new', 'car', '2', 'years', 'Well', 'could', 'be', 'worse', 'Personally', ""'d"", 'rather', 'laugh', 'decent', 'comedy', 'own.The', 'Book', 'Eli', 'place', '30', 'years', 'massive', 'war', 'broke', 'out', 'earth', 'Nuclear', 'warfare', 'apparently', 'destroyed', 'ozone', 'layer', 'anyone', 'taking', 'leisurely', 'stroll', 'park', 'walking', 'dog', 'was', 'burnt', 'crisp', 'lucky', 'ones', 'who', 'were', 'inside', 'watching', 'Jerry', 'Springer', 'survived', 'did', 'what', 'could', 'continue', 'surviving', 'year', 'when', 'were', 'finally', 'able', 'go', 'out', 'barren', 'likes', 'video', 'game', 'Fallout', '3', 'least', 'what', 'Walker', 'Denzel', 'Washington', 'reflective', 'Christian', 'teachings', 'anecdote', 'being', 'wasteful', 'having', 'more', 'need.Walker', 'man', 'who', 'been', 'walking', '30', 'years', 'remaining', 'United', 'States', 'America', 'deliver', 'bible', 'out', 'west', 'actual', 'place', 'go', 'unknown', 'Walker', ""'ll"", 'have', 'feeling', 'when', 'Why', '30', 'years', 'walk', 'USA', 'something', 'learn', 'later.In', 'travels', 'food', 'water', 'fights', 'ambush', 'parties', 'iPod', 'bible', 'town', 'run', 'Gary', 'Oldman', 'who', 'been', 'searching', 'bible', 'help', 'control', 'little', 'town', 'Obviously', 'Walker', ""n't"", 'going', 'give', 'up', 'fight', 'then', 'would', 'hardly', 'be', 'movie', 'watch.So', 'what', 'good', 'movie', 'Well', 'scenery', 'awesome', 'Anyone', 'who', 'played', 'video', 'game', 'Fallout', '3', 'will', 'feel', 'quite', 'home', 'landscapes', 'almost', 'images', 'were', 'lifted', 'game', 'shot', 'live-action', 'begging', 'live-action', 'movie', 'own.The', 'depiction', 'life', 'post-apocalyptica', 'interesting', 'as', 'well', 'course', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'most', 'before', 'Mad', 'Max', 'series', 'thought-provoking', 'just', 'same.Denzel', 'Washington', 'Gary', 'Oldman', 'do', 'great', 'job', 'what', 'are', 'given', 'characters', 'Anyone', 'less', 'would', 'have', 'probably', 'made', 'walk', 'film', 'Sadly', 'only', 'so', 'much', 'talented', 'actors', 'can', 'do', 'keep', 'film', 'water', 'Mila', 'Kunis', 'good', 'eye', 'candy', 'especially', 'movie', 'where', 'most', 'people', 'have', 'weird', 'growths', 'coming', 'rest', 'movie', 'just', 'drawn', 'out', 'annoying.For', 'one', 'twist', 'spoiler-free', 'purposes', 'Walker', 'aggravating', 'look', 'back', 'movie', 'can', 'understand', 'why', 'certain', 'things', 'twist', 'same', 'time', 'are', 'other', 'elements', 'shots', 'do', ""n't"", 'make', 'sense', 'time', 'director', 'fighting', 'storyline', 'scenery', 'Obviously', 'scenery', 'kept', 'winning', 'making', 'movie', 'pretty', 'shallow.The', 'religious', 'theme', 'also', 'irked', 'not', 'as', 'much', ""'d"", 'thought', 'Gary', 'Oldman', 'interpretation', 'Devil', 'incarnate', 'was', 'fantastic', 'use', 'theology', 'explain', 'away', 'how', 'Walker', 'trucking', 'tired', 'uninteresting', 'Granted', 'hard', 'do', 'movie', 'book', 'Eli', 'human', 'side', 'Walker', 'coming', 'only', 'very', 'very', 'end', 'hard', 'take', 'religious', 'overtones', 'seriously.In', 'end', 'give', 'movie', '2', '5', 'Pip-Boy', '3000s']",N/A

MENACE II SOCIETY had moments of flair and style, but ultimately was not a good film. DEAD PRESIDENTS is one of the most needlessly violent films I've ever seen, and while I appreciate the point it's trying to make, it doesn't make it well. FROM HELL... well, being a comic fan and a devotee of Alan Moore, this film was simply god-awful. And then I saw the trailer for THE BOOK OF ELI, and I thought to myself... COOL! Denzel as a post-apocalyptic wasteland Zatoichi-esque wanderer and Gary Oldman as his nemesis. That seems like the recipe for a really kick-butt film. But... no. They manage to take a really interesting premise and make it convoluted, cliched, inanimate and ultimately dull. The problems that the two stars of the film face the most is that they've played these roles before, and they've played them better. Denzel did the FAR superior MAN ON FIRE and Gary did the FAR superior LEON: THE PROFESSIONAL.What also upsets me is the way that not just this film, but every film that the great Ray Stevenson seems to be in, his talent is just wasted.The film operates under a similar pretense to another superior film, Kurt Wimmer's EQUILIBRIUM, that certain abstract things (in this case, certain 'books') cause death, destruction and war. And what has caused more death and destruction throughout history than religion? Again, if you've read anything on the description of this film, you know that the book Denzel is carrying with him is the last-known copy of the King James bible. And apparently, this bible is giving him a supernatural ability to resist harm and kick serious tail. Denzel's dialogue consists mainly of how he's ""being led by faith"" or ""being guided by God""... old hat. Gary goes for the quiet insane that has bursts of rage and violence. Old hat. The desolate post-nuclear wastes are shot with highly bleached colors. OLD... HAT. How this film becomes even worse is that Denzel gets a kid sidekick. Well, it's twenty-something hottie Mila Kunis, but she has the emotional range of a twelve-year old, so for all intents and purposes, she's a kid sidekick.And the film, near the end, has an O.Henry-like twist that is so incredibly stupid that I had trouble believing that they included it.Another mess by the formerly-promising Hughes Brothers.

He's still looking pretty delicious too--more so--now that he is older.The fighting scenes were notable for not being over-the-top or over-long.

Which is a plus for long-time movie fight watchers who are bitterly all too used to slowed frames, repeated impact glory shots and other martial art cheese that would not begin to transmit what a totally abrupt and brutal thing fighting can be--especially with weapons involved. But Eli is like a paladin on a quest who is clothed, shielded and armed in holy wrath. And so, he does not hesitate or play around when it comes to dispatching people but simply handles it--and keeps on walking.Portions of the ending were cleverly concealed and there is a moment of 'enlightenment', details of which I shall not go into.

1310905,A1EA7VXIUZBYIK,B002ZG997C,"Jason Brown ""Dark-edged Apologist""","[1, 3]","Before I start on the movie, here's a short list of people I know that's enjoyed this. Me (I'm a Christian, but I refuse to be religious, no matter what the status quo says), my brother (who's a nihilistic agnostic), a former boss of mine (who's borderline agnostic/atheist), and a couple friends of mine (anywhere from Christian to atheist to skeptic). None of them had anything bad to say, no matter how overt the Christian themes were. No matter how obvious the Christianity was. And they never felt preached at, nor felt this was religious propaganda at all. Why? I don't think it was only because there were a couple dozen f-bombs and other such swearing, heavy amounts of brutal violence (including decapitations and dismemberments), and references to taboo issues even churches would be extremely uncomfortable talking about, let alone dealing with.Story wise, by this point in time, everyone knows what it's about, so I'll skip that and go into more technical details. Like something I noticed rarely comes up in other people's reviews- there's references to cannibalism (never explicit, but if you know human biology, you can notice it) and systematic manipulation of religion (something that dictators throughout history have tried using the Bible for, just to control the masses- just look at the Inquisition and the Catholic Church in the Medieval era).Action wise, this movie does provide plenty of heavy action. From the (forementioned) decapitation and dismemberments to crazy gunplay and even a rocket or two thrown in for good (and eye-popping) measure. From the visual style, the people who worked on this (who also worked on Boyz in da Hood) did a real good job at the visual filter to make sure it didn't look like every other Hollywood film (meaning too realistic and next to no actual artistic value), and a couple visual allusions to specific art styles and known portraits, but mainly by the name of the style.As for this ""religious propaganda"", I don't see any, and I am, in no way, religious. Just because someone protects a Bible, I suppose, means it's Churchey propaganda.

Denzel Washington plays Eli, who reminds you of the ultimate warrior on a quest for a holy graile. He is unstoppable as he overcomes obtacles in his journey west across the country, the worst being a tribal gang leader (of sorts) who is in a desperate search for a copy of the Bible. His scheme is to build a religious fiefdom of survivors who will cow at his scripture-quoting silver tongued oratory. Eli has the last copy known to exist and is unshakable in pursuing his mission, seeing his rival for the huckster that he is. The plot stands up. Great irony is portrayed through the post-nuclear holocaust world. One of the better lines delivered by Eli is telling a young woman (Mila Kunis) about the world before. &#34;We had so many things.

Denzel Washington does a wonderful portrayal of his character Eli on a quest to deliver a book.  Gary Oldman plays Carnegie, a big boss of small town searching for a special book to control the people, one particular book.  Guess who has the one he is looking for.If you look at the ratings for this movie currently they are 50% for 5 Stars and rest are evenly spread out over 1 - 4 stars.  That says something.  This movie makes you think and not just sit on your couch.  There are some people that get the complete story and there are some that don't.  If you get it you apparently are one of us with Faith (Eli, Solara, Claudia and possibly Redridge) and if you don't get it maybe your without Faith (Carnegie, etc).  You're blind to what gives this movie substance.  I would have like to seen this movie have a few more action scenes or more drama at times.  But the pacing fits the landscape the story is set in (sparse and desolate).Guro Dan Inosanto and Jeff Imada did a great job on the fight sequences and training Denzel for his role.*** SPOILERS *** SPOILERS ***If you have not seen the movie then stop reading RIGHT NOW.  The two big surprises in the movie are the book itself and the fact that Eli is a blind man.  I have seen some on the internet state that the book was saved to just sit on a shelf.  That his quest was a waste.  If you look clearly at the scenes of the printing press you notice they are printing multiple versions of each page.  They are printing multiple copies so THE WORD can be spread.Looking at the movie a 2nd time take his blindness this way.  Eli was blind before his quest and when he arrived at his destination.  When Eli takes on his quest from GOD he is given sight so he can complete his task.  Proof of his ""sight by Faith"" would be the fact that he maneuvers in an environment without any issues.  That his eyes focus when he is talking to people.  Only on a few scenes does he use his hands to sense his environment.  In the making-of documentary on the disk the writer states that Eli is not a former soldier.  He is just someone who developed these skills to fight along the way.  A blind man would not train himself raise his pistol or shotgun to aim.  He would not be able to take out a sniper over 100 feet away on different elevation from behind him based on sound.  He would not be accurate with a bow and arrow without his sight.  He would not know the house was off to the side of the road and stay the night unless he had sight.When GOD gave him his mission Eli received GOD'S protection.  Proof of his protection would be Eli being shot at by Redridge in the town twice and not being hit both times.

I believe there is a higher power, I just don't believe in organized religion. I don't believe you need a church or a book to believe in a god or a higher power. I think all you need is faith, and that comes from within. Now I have no ill will toward religion as a whole. It can be used for great good. Giving people without hope, hope. Giving people the will to live and helping people do great things for the benefit of humanity. It can also used for great evil as all religions have done throughout the centuries, and I think that is ultimately the message I think the film conveys.The Book of Eli is a religious movie that hides behind a post apocalyptic, western theme. Which follows Eli(Denzel Washington) as he wanders the wasteland heading west carrying the last remaining bible looking for the right person to give it to. On his journey west he comes to a town run by Carnegie(Gary Oldman) who so happens to be looking for a copy of the bible, so he can use it for his own means. Which puts the two at odds with each other, and with the add of Solara(Mila Kunis) the two go on the run. The climax and the twist near the end you will never see coming.The actingwas brilliant. Washington and Oldman as usual do outstanding jobs. The supporting cast did a great job from Mila Kunis(who I thought was great.) to Ray Stevenson(Punisher: War Zone), Jennifer Beals(Lie To Me), and Malcolm McDowell(Heros and Fall Out 3).The visuals were superbly done giving life to the pos apocalyptic world. You can imagine that's what the world would look like after a nuclear war, though they never say what caused the world to come to be except a war.The directing by the The Hughes Brothers was well done. They haven't directed many movies. The only other one of their movies I've seen is From Hell which I personally loved. So from the two movies I've seen of theirs they are really good directorswho should get more work.Overall this is the best film I've seen since Zombieland, and unlike the other recent movies I've seen The Book of Eli blends story with a message, acting, action, directing, and visuals perfectly.

However, it suffered from two main problems.  One is post-Apocalyptic fatigue.  Seems like there have been many such movies over the last few years (""The Road"", ""Doomsday"", and ""Resident Evil - Extinction"" come to mind).  After a while, these start to look and feel alike.  The second problem is the premise -- that somehow bibles have become non-existent.  Considering how many bibles have been printed and distributed since forever, this seems quite implausible.  There are certainly many more bibles than guns--and the movie had no lack of guns. Also there probably weren't enough people left after ""The Flash"" to mount a campaign to burn all bibles.

The vast majority of the population was wiped out. Only those fortunate enough to be underground or in a formidable shelter survived. Nothing much seems to grow in the desert that has taken over the US. There is hardly any water.  Eli (Denzell) is a walker who walks into Carnegie's (Oldman's) town. Carnegie is looking for a book that he thinks will help him rule the stupid people that are left and will stop at nothing to get it. Guess who has the book? The acting is excellent. The bleak cinematography was interesting but the limited color palette became a bit annoying. As a strictly action flick I would rate this 4 stars, but it tries to be a thinking person's post apocalyptic film and as such I must rate it 2 stars. There are way too many holes in the plot. Civilization was totally destroyed by the ""event"" yet somehow there was enough organization to round up and burn just about every bible in existence. Thirty years after the tire factories were destroyed, marauders have gasoline, motorcycles and trucks with usable tires and evidently, enough spare parts to keep them on the road.

Washington plays the lead who is wandering `west' to deliver a book of great power. He is a fearsome warrior who deals very violently with the assortment of cannibalistic thugs who roam the roads. The crux of the story is his encounter with Gary Oldman, who is trying to re-establish civilization, though his methods aren't  terribly civilized. Oldman wants the book and Washington refuses. More violence.The basic story is not new. Many stories have explored the dim days following the collapse of order and the scavenging needed to survive. Human principles are disgarded by almost everyone and cannibalism is the new fast food. The fresh element here is religion. Washington has a purpose greater than personal survival and he must defy the forces that seek to exploit it. Even so, it is at best only average fair. The fight scenes aren't too special and if you think about it too much, there are some perplexing plot issues.Personally I welcomed the religious element, though I suspect it's not developed sufficiently for the faithful, and it's probably still too much for those who are resistant.

1310933,A22BPC7LRSGSYQ,B002ZG997C,Joker,"[4, 6]","WARNING: Some spoilers aheadI saw The Book Of Eli (2010) in the theater the day after it was released in January.  I liked it very much.  Denzel Washington was on top of his game in this film.  So was Gary Oldman.  This movie also stars Mila Kunis and Jennifer Beals.I'll briefly sum up the plot like this:  It is a post-apocalytic world.  Thirty years earlier the apocalytic event took place.  A man named Eli (Denzel Washington) has in his possession the last remaining King James version of the Bible in the world.  Yes, that's right.  He's a wandering nomad who's on a mission to deliver the Bible to a safe haven in the western part of the U.S.  He travels on foot.  It turns out that Alcatraz Island in San Francisco Bay ends up being the safe haven.  Along the way to San Francisco, Eli encounters a lot of danger from thieves.  He defeats his adversaries quite easily with his great fighting skills.  He also shows great survival skills.  Eli runs into Carnegie (Gary Oldman), a man who is hell bent on obtaining the Bible.  Carnegie's blind concubine named Claudia (Jennifer Beals) gives Eli water and some food.  Carnegie's daughter Solara (Mila Kunis) finds out Eli has some kind of book in his possession, but she doesn't know what the book is.  When Carnegie asks her what kind of book it is, she just indicates that there is a cross symbol on the cover.  Carnegie realizes it's a Bible.  Eli and his company seek a safe haven in a house, where the residents, Martha (Frances de la Tour) and George (Michael Gambon) are armed and ready at all times.  After an ambush of the house, Carnegie gets possession of the Bible by forcing Eli to hand it over.  Eli gets shot at one point, but continues on as if he isn't hurt very much.  To further sum it up, Eli makes it to Alcatraz and recites the entire Bible from memory.  Carnegie has the actual book.  Carnegie opens up the book and discovers it's written in braille because Eli, as it turns out, is blind.  Claudia (who is blind) refuses to read it to him.  After Eli is done reciting the Bible from memory, he expires from his wounds.  Solara walks home instead of living at Alcatraz.Some things in this movie are quite unbelievable, such as how a blind man can fight and kill people, how there's only one Bible left in the world (even though it was stated in the movie that all the Bibles were burned).

I was faced with a dilemma in viewing this movie that I noticed only one other reviewer picked up on (he gave the movie one star).  If Eli, played very adeptly by Denzel Washington, had wholly memorized the bible, then why wasn't he applying the teachings in the good book to his daily life?  Why did he stand by in ignorance while a woman was brutally raped only yards from where he was hiding, especially if he KNEW that he was protected and untouchable?  It's not like he had to fear for his life.  He knew that God had appointed him as a messenger, and that His hand was covering him.  Protection is one thing, but why go around killing people when the very book you are safekeeping clearly states that murder is unholy and sinful?  Was there no way to talk his way out of those situations?  I'm fairly certain that God would have provided Eli the ""gift of gab"" just as well as he provided him the ability to kill thirty armed and burly men in thirty seconds.  There are more questions along these lines, but why bore you with monotony?Why five stars then,  you ask?Simple...this was probably one of the most entertaining movies of the year for me.  Here's why:1. Mila Kunis has really become quite the actress, and she is most enjoyable to watch, as she is in EVERYTHING she does.  Gary Oldman is perfectly cast and very much in his element, and Denzel Washington is top-notch as the hero in this unlikely role.2. All the questions in the first paragraph can be explained in only one way...the answer?THE HUMAN CONDITIONEli, being human, was so focused on the mission at hand that he missed everything the bible told him as he read it.  The saying goes something like ""Can't see the forest for the trees.""  Doesn't that happen every single day to every single bible-guided person out there?  Freewill breeds sin, and within sin is the human condition to ""Look out for number one"" rather than put others before yourself.  Eli even told Solara that what he had taken away from everything he had read in the bible was to put others before yourself, but yet, just as all of us are prone to do, he didn't necessarily practice what he preached on a day-to-day basis.So instead of focusing on the position Mr. One-Star review took on the movie, which is thinking that since Eli memorized the bible, he should be perfect, I choose to look at it from the next view AFTER that point-of-view.  Eli could only do the best that he could do with what he was given...for after all, HE WAS ONLY HUMAN.One more note of interest...HE WAS BLIND!",5,Thinker or a Stinker?,1276732800,"06 17, 2010",2010,2752,"['SPOILERS', 'SPOILERS', 'SPOILERS', 'Book', 'Eli', 'was', 'incredible', 'movie', 'sense', 'what', 'out', 'deliver', 'tight', 'story', 'exceptional', 'actors', 'quite', 'subversive', 'bleak', 'atmosphere', 'was', 'faced', 'dilemma', 'viewing', 'movie', 'noticed', 'only', 'one', 'other', 'reviewer', 'picked', 'up', 'gave', 'movie', 'one', 'star', 'Eli', 'played', 'very', 'adeptly', 'Denzel', 'Washington', 'had', 'wholly', 'memorized', 'bible', 'then', 'why', 'was', ""n't"", 'applying', 'teachings', 'good', 'book', 'daily', 'life', 'Why', 'did', 'stand', 'ignorance', 'woman', 'was', 'brutally', 'raped', 'only', 'yards', 'where', 'was', 'hiding', 'especially', 'KNEW', 'was', 'protected', 'untouchable', 'not', 'had', 'fear', 'life', 'knew', 'God', 'had', 'appointed', 'messenger', 'hand', 'was', 'covering', 'Protection', 'one', 'thing', 'why', 'go', 'killing', 'people', 'when', 'very', 'book', 'are', 'safekeeping', 'clearly', 'states', 'murder', 'unholy', 'sinful', 'Was', 'way', 'talk', 'way', 'situations', ""'m"", 'fairly', 'certain', 'God', 'would', 'have', 'provided', 'Eli', 'gift', 'gab', 'just', 'as', 'well', 'provided', 'ability', 'kill', 'thirty', 'armed', 'burly', 'men', 'thirty', 'seconds', 'are', 'more', 'questions', 'lines', 'why', 'bore', 'monotony', 'Why', 'five', 'stars', 'then', 'ask', 'Simple', 'was', 'probably', 'one', 'most', 'entertaining', 'movies', 'year', 'Here', 'why:1', 'Mila', 'Kunis', 'really', 'become', 'quite', 'actress', 'most', 'enjoyable', 'watch', 'EVERYTHING', 'Gary', 'Oldman', 'perfectly', 'cast', 'very', 'much', 'element', 'Denzel', 'Washington', 'top-notch', 'hero', 'unlikely', 'role.2', 'questions', 'first', 'paragraph', 'can', 'be', 'explained', 'only', 'one', 'way', 'answer', 'HUMAN', 'CONDITIONEli', 'being', 'human', 'was', 'so', 'focused', 'mission', 'hand', 'missed', 'everything', 'bible', 'told', 'read', 'saying', 'something', 'Ca', ""n't"", 'see', 'forest', 'trees', ""n't"", 'happen', 'single', 'day', 'single', 'bible-guided', 'person', 'there', 'Freewill', 'sin', 'sin', 'human', 'condition', 'Look', 'out', 'number', 'one', 'rather', 'put', 'others', 'Eli', 'even', 'told', 'Solara', 'what', 'had', 'taken', 'away', 'everything', 'had', 'read', 'bible', 'was', 'put', 'others', 'yet', 'just', 'are', 'prone', 'do', 'did', ""n't"", 'necessarily', 'practice', 'what', 'preached', 'day-to-day', 'basis.So', 'instead', 'focusing', 'position', 'Mr.', 'One-Star', 'review', 'took', 'movie', 'thinking', 'Eli', 'memorized', 'bible', 'should', 'be', 'perfect', 'choose', 'look', 'next', 'view', 'AFTER', 'point-of-view', 'Eli', 'could', 'only', 'do', 'best', 'could', 'do', 'what', 'was', 'given', 'HE', 'WAS', 'ONLY', 'HUMAN.One', 'more', 'note', 'interest', 'HE', 'WAS', 'BLIND']",N/A

You've seen it before; last year's exceptional ""Adventureland"" was one of the more recent casualties.  And, if my theory proves correct, The Hughes Bros.' ""Eli"" could be 2010's first.It's a tragedy, to say the least as, judged under the merits it abides by, Eli is a thought-provoking, imaginative, and collectively disciplined action drama that's only a little pretentious.  It's not the next post-apocalyptic, action oriented crowd pleaser, nor was it really meant to be from the start.  Sure, there are artificial injections of action sequences that are quite good (especially one during the latter half that mushrooms into a spiraling shootout that is truly exciting), but they only act to needlessly complicate things.As a result, the movie itself suffers severely from a real identity crisis, not appealing enough to any particular audience aside from those who respect a theme with heart, a stellar cast, and a realized vision.  The sparse wastelands that the Hughes siblings have presented to us may not be my favorite post-fallout world, but it's hard to not call it one of the more authentic and genuine yet seen in cinema.Denzel Washington, having produced the film alongside veteran Silver, is solid, as always, who's performance nearly makes us forget how forgettably cut-out and tight-lipped his role requires him to be.  Gambon and company are satisfactory, and Kunis is decent as a more unconventional sidekick, but the real star here is Gary Oldman, who  has a special gift for getting the absolute best out of his villainous roles.  It's an impeccable fit, and he's a real joy to watch.  Another particular performer who I greatly admire makes an appearance, but I'll leave that for those who can catch him when he makes his screen entrance.I know I'm not the only one who had expected to walk into this theatre assuming that my brain wouldn't be doing much more than twiddling his thumbs while my visual senses would get an eye candy workout.  Truth be told, I cant help but feel gipped after coming to the realization that, yes, there was a story and a theme, and it really was worth paying attention to.  Ultimately, that's the fault of the marketing team and, to a lesser extent, screenwriter Gary Whitta, who's ambition couldn't quite translate onto paper.That said, I can't blame anyone but myself for judging Eli's book by its seemingly flashy, hollow cover, only to find something actually meaningful within.",3,The Book of Eli,1324166400,"12 18, 2011",2011,2509,"['truly', 'sad', 'see', 'films', 'odds', 'own', 'marketing', 'departments', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'last', 'year', 'exceptional', 'Adventureland', 'was', 'one', 'more', 'recent', 'casualties', 'theory', 'proves', 'correct', 'Hughes', 'Bros.', 'Eli', 'could', 'be', '2010', 'first.It', 'tragedy', 'say', 'least', 'judged', 'merits', 'Eli', 'thought-provoking', 'imaginative', 'collectively', 'disciplined', 'action', 'drama', 'only', 'little', 'pretentious', 'not', 'next', 'post-apocalyptic', 'action', 'oriented', 'crowd', 'pleaser', 'was', 'really', 'meant', 'be', 'start', 'Sure', 'are', 'artificial', 'injections', 'action', 'sequences', 'are', 'quite', 'good', 'especially', 'one', 'latter', 'half', 'spiraling', 'shootout', 'truly', 'exciting', 'only', 'act', 'needlessly', 'complicate', 'things.As', 'result', 'movie', 'severely', 'real', 'identity', 'crisis', 'not', 'appealing', 'enough', 'particular', 'audience', 'aside', 'who', 'respect', 'theme', 'heart', 'stellar', 'cast', 'realized', 'vision', 'sparse', 'wastelands', 'Hughes', 'siblings', 'have', 'presented', 'may', 'not', 'be', 'favorite', 'post-fallout', 'world', 'hard', 'not', 'call', 'one', 'more', 'authentic', 'genuine', 'yet', 'seen', 'cinema.Denzel', 'Washington', 'having', 'produced', 'film', 'veteran', 'Silver', 'solid', 'always', 'who', 'performance', 'nearly', 'forget', 'how', 'forgettably', 'cut-out', 'tight-lipped', 'role', 'be', 'Gambon', 'company', 'are', 'satisfactory', 'Kunis', 'decent', 'more', 'unconventional', 'sidekick', 'real', 'star', 'here', 'Gary', 'Oldman', 'who', 'special', 'gift', 'getting', 'absolute', 'best', 'villainous', 'roles', 'impeccable', 'fit', 'real', 'joy', 'watch', 'particular', 'performer', 'who', 'greatly', 'admire', 'appearance', ""'ll"", 'leave', 'who', 'can', 'catch', 'when', 'screen', 'entrance.I', 'know', ""'m"", 'not', 'only', 'one', 'who', 'had', 'expected', 'walk', 'theatre', 'assuming', 'brain', 'would', ""n't"", 'be', 'doing', 'much', 'more', 'twiddling', 'thumbs', 'visual', 'senses', 'would', 'get', 'eye', 'candy', 'workout', 'Truth', 'be', 'told', 'cant', 'help', 'feel', 'gipped', 'coming', 'realization', 'yes', 'was', 'story', 'theme', 'really', 'was', 'worth', 'paying', 'attention', 'Ultimately', 'fault', 'marketing', 'team', 'lesser', 'extent', 'screenwriter', 'Gary', 'Whitta', 'who', 'ambition', 'could', ""n't"", 'quite', 'translate', 'paper.That', 'said', 'ca', ""n't"", 'blame', 'anyone', 'judging', 'Eli', 'book', 'seemingly', 'flashy', 'hollow', 'cover', 'only', 'find', 'something', 'actually', 'meaningful']",N/A

You come to understand that decades before, mankind had decided that destroying himself was the thing to do.  Washington/Eli comes across some bad guys who he dispatches quickly.  He is like a super hero.  There is nothing he can do wrong in fighting these guys who are trying to take what he has.  Yet, this is some very intense violence, some of the more gory violence as well.  There are some off scene but mostly quick hitting in your face type violence.  There are yet more of this to come.But the story moves a little slowly as he walks toward his ultimate goal.  Moving West.Washington is very intense in this movie.  Gary Oldman (Carnegie), is an ornery leader of a town where it is like the wild west.  They have water, some food, but not much else.  The decay is endless, and you wonder what town they are in.  Kunis plays a young woman who is basically a subject of Oldman, and she comes into contact with Eli and gets involved in his quest without her complete understanding of what it is.The movie is very good, yet, since there are times where you see the devastation and he seems to walk somewhat onward, it may have been good as a subplot to have Eli's early life shown as well as that of Carnegie's. Actually in the DVD extra there is a bit on Carnegie as a child and that may have been a good way to do this, injecting it into the scenes without losing the flavor or the moment.As you know, the book that Eli is carrying is the Bible.  There is a tug here.  The Bible is blamed for the cause of the disaster that has the world as it is.  Yet, it is a book of hope.  One wants it to control others, the other, wants it because he is destined to.The scenes of the bridges and towns after the destruction are intense and seem even real.

Denzel Washington as always was very good, but the rest of the cast came up a little short.  For the record I think Mila Kunis is absolutely gorgeous but as far as an end of the world warrior in training, I just don't see it.  Gary Oldman was just a disappointment.  I couldn't see him convincing me in this role at all.  I think he was going for a Dennis Hopper persona but there is, or was, only one Dennis Hopper.The movie begins with 10 minutes or so of Denzel in isolation making his way across the country.  All we really find out is he is going west, he loves his IPod and if you attempt to get in his way you will lose a body part of some sort.  He doesn't look for violence but when pressed, he will fight back with a vengeance.  Luckily there aren't many people who get in his way.  The world has been destroyed and much of the population wiped out.  It appears to be from a nuclear war but in reality the cause and effect is never completely explained.Denzel finds his way to a local city and at that point we discover Gary Oldman and his gang of bike riding goons, who are all looking for a book.  It is a special book and all we know is that it can be used as a weapon.  It was easy for me to read what was happening at that point, the hints were pretty blatant, but I will not give the secret away for those of you who might not pick up on what direction the movie was heading.  Denzel happens to posses the book and won't give it up.  He actually kills anyone who tries to take it, and in-between the violent melees he meets Mila Kunis.The second big surprise, which affects Denzel, becomes pretty evident as well.  I hate it when  movie gives too many clues.  Again, I won't give it away, but the dude can smell anything and everything within a mile of where he stands.  What kind of guy has a better sense of smell than my dog?  Pretty damn impressive.  No wonder he wasn't jumping all over Mila Kunis.  If anyone, even in a post nuclear meltdown met that woman, they would be all over her.  Denzel stays true to his calling and other than killing numerous people, he in the end delivers on his preordained mystical directive.I think if I was sitting in my house, survived nuclear destruction and some voice called me from the inner recesses of my brain telling me to pick a book and take it west; I would have a glass of scotch and call it a day.  That is probably why I will never be in the movies I guess.Overall the movie had some decent action scenes, Denzel as always was brilliant but the plot and supporting actors fell short in my opinion.  There just wasn't a lot of depth here.  Bring me back to the Mad Max days and Mel Gibson.

Enter Denzel Washington as Eli, who may or may not be insane after wandering westward for the last 30 years through an ashen wasteland, and Gary Oldman as Carnegie, his eventual nemesis, and a man who apparently was ready to welcome the apocalypse with a big flinty hug. The First half of the film is well done and eerie, beginning with a brief, but fascinating hunt involving a a scrawny cat, as well as a beautifully executed silhouette fight scene straight out of a comic book. Eli is intense and mythical as he moves through a wonderfully rendered world of muddy browns and wounded skies that offer him his only comfort. His tools include a bow and arrow for catching dinner, a terribly sharp mid length blade that would do a Klingon proud and can slice and dice baddies with ease, and a battered Ipod for entertainment. Apparently Steve jobs built it to survive Armageddon--who knew! When the film reaches the outpost sequence it changes quite dramatically. Oldman and Washington play their roles to perfection as a life and death struggle ensues between the two (Eli has something Carnegie would love to get his dirty paws on to make him king of the world.) Mila Kunis, seeming more then a bit miscast in this film, manages to hold her own in Scenes with Oldman, Jennifer Beales who plays her mother, and Washington, as she forces her way into Eli's lonely existence and becomes his companion. There is religious overtone to this film that may or may not turn you off, but the film balances it with powerful action sequences and great humor. There are also a few huge twists at the end that are well executed. Be sure not to tell anyone what they are after you have seen it. Overall a solid, engrossing film that will entertain you without a doubt.

A blanched and bleaching landscape that more resembles the moon than Earth, and where sunglasses and Chapstick are used as money. We can only guess at what happened and Eli only tells us about ""the flash"" and a hole was torn in the atmosphere. Eli is heading ""west"" toward an uncertain destination like a post-apocalyptic Shaolin priest to deliver a book to unknown people who may be able to use the book to restart civilization.Eli is a survivor, as he travels the destroyed roads of civilization his skills have become finely honed, he can smell the camouflaged highwaymen and dispatches them using a machete, or karate and in only extreme cases does he use a gun, he has to conserve bullets.In his travels Eli comes into a town run by Gary Oldman's Carnegie, a man bent on consolidating and spreading his ruthless rule by sending out the highwaymen to search for books. One book in particular, a book that will give him the power to manipulate people so he can extend his ruthless influence. Humorously, Carnegie orders the DaVinci Code and Oprah magazine burned, or is it a sly commentary on the impermanence of pop culture? Carnegie discovers Eli has the book he's looking for and tries to trade for it with water and failing that, his daughter Solara (Mila Kunis). Eli isn't the type of man Carnegie is used to dealing with and Eli leaves, but not without killing many of Carnegie's men.Roger Ebert in his review said the ending has a WTF moment and I expected some horrible inconsistency or deus ex-machina but I found the ending consistent with the rest of the movie and plausible within the world in which the characters find themselves. There is one minor inconsistency in the plot that is never explained. Eli locks Solara in a cave but mysteriously enough and without explanation in the next scene she's chasing after Eli.Denzel Washington is one of the few actors whose movies I'll go see without knowing too much about the movie and his performance is his usual rock solid characterization. He plays Eli very subtly and with few words but emotion that pulls you in. Gary Oldman is as creepy or maybe creepier than he was in Bram Stoker's Dracula. Or maybe it was the Hughes Brothers decision to film Oldman with every crevice and blemish of his complexion marring his face that defines the character. Mila Kunis as Solara seems to be coming into her own as an actress and is more than able to hold her own in scenes with Washington.Directed by the Hughes Brothers whose previous credits include From Hell they have created a bleak landscape that is devoid of color and use all shades of black, white and gray without the movie being or feeling like it's in black and white.I went to the movie without expecting too much and I reall enjoyed the movie, my verdict?

The wastelands of post apocalypse America are filmed in New Mexico...direction, cinematography, costumes, plot, script and casting all top notch.Eli's 30 years of walking encompass spiritual awakening and enlightenment for the viewer and many of those who cross his path (those who survive, anyhow). The plot centers around delivering a rare ""book of faith"" to an unknown place...mystery, drama, action and sci-fi horror abounding. Washington really extends his notable talent to portray a multifaceted character...a pariah, an enigma, a saint, a survivor with lightning fast reflexes, and yes, someone who eats what is necessary to survive, even a cat. Realism involves distasteful scenes, but it never fails to fascinate me on how callous we become to the suffering of humans...and yet, our horror and outrage cannot be contained if another species is harmed in a scene...reminiscent of watching Mr. Jingles get stomped in the Green Mile...kill all the humans, just don't hurt the animals! Hmmmm...Great supporting cast of Gary Oldman as the CEO (Carnegie) of the new Wastelands. Mila Kunis (Solara) is terrific as Eli's traveling companion, reluctant protege, and the movie's visual delight. Those cool layered post apocalyptic clothes might catch on! Another memorable character is Jennifer Beals (who plays Claudia, Solara's mother and Carnegie's blind concubine). Beals emotes a surprising and welcome acting range, in having little choice in being a companion to an evil villain.I loved thi movie, because it is provocative....and to read reviewers bickering over whether this movie is religious or spiritual is an interesting observation...indeed.

Denzel Washington was great, as always, and so was Gary Olman, but the story line was a wee bit slow at times and kind of lacking a punch.  It was a little gory, too (at least for me, anyway--not really my kind of movie).The story begins with fallen ash and dead bodies everywhere.  There has been a massive war that has left many dead and the land stripped.  It has become survival of the fittest for the most part.  Gangs are worse than wild animals and often ambush folks and take whatever they can to survive. Water and food are hard to find.  Some people even resort to eating human meat, and they are the ones with shaky hands.  The basic scene is very similar to Mel Gibson's ""Mad Max"" movie from the 1970s (?).Denzel (Eli) is our hero.  He walks the land in peace, trying to survive, but he can also defend himself when others try to mess with him.  He is unbelievably quick with a knife, gun, or arrow and when he must kill, he prays over the bodies.  He carries a book with him and is on a mission from God to take the book to the West Coast.  The book is the King James Bible.  After the war, all other remaining copies of the book were destroyed.Gary Olman is a power hungry bad guy who is searching for the same book, because it is said to give power to its owner and he wants to create a kingdom for himself out of what's left.  Gary gets a bit overly enthusiastic when he finds out that Eli has that book and the struggle begins.As I said, it's good but not great, although both actors do an excellent job in their roles.

He is so devoted to the physical object, and what it symbolizes, that he completely ignores the message therein.Further, he wantonly slaughters those who act aggressively toward him, again in the name of his religious zealotry.  What happened to ""turn the other cheek""?  What happened to ""thous shalt not kill""?  Those seem like pretty clear directives to me...but does this character, who supposedly has memorized the entire bible from slavishly reading and rereading it with little to no actual comprehension of it get these simple teachings?  No.  All these teachings conveniently vanish when faced with a threat to his shallow devotion to the symbol.  He even has the nerve to quote scripture AS he's killing.

1310961,A34D4KCP94ACJZ,B002ZG997C,K. Driscoll,"[4, 8]","By now, I'm sure every fan of the Fallout video games knows that the book Eli (Denzel Washington) is protecting is the Wasteland Survival Guide, while every Christian thinks it's the bible.  The Book of Eli is on the surface a great action thriller, but a major bummer of a movie in terms of its view on humankind.  It's likeThe Roadbut only it assumes humanity requires religion in order to be civilized, a point I personally despise and disagree with vehemently.  Nevertheless, if we can pretend that in this little fictional futuristic world the word of god is imperative, else we all become cannibalistic sociopaths, then the Book of Eli can be forgiven.  I on the other hand will take its fundamentally preachy storytelling into account as a stern critic. For those reasons, the movie bothered me deeply.The year is 2043 and the world has been a post-apocalyptic nightmare for thirty years.  Tribes roam the wasteland raping and pillaging while Eli (Washington) ""goes west"" with his book in his backpack and divine intervention as his protection.  Along the way he meets sexy Mila Kunis, whose acting is just above modeling; big old mean Ray Stevenson, who naturally rules every scene he is in; Tom Waits, one of my favorite musicians who becomes a futuristic tinkerer; a blind Jennifer Beals, who, like most women here is constantly the damsel in distress; and of course the always awesome baddie Gary Oldman, who does his very best Jack Nicholson while still piecing together some seriously cool villainy.  Obviously there are major spoilers here so I'll keep somewhat restrained, but Oldman's character is bent on finding the bible and using it to control civilization, while Eli hears voices that tell him to bring it elsewhere, and use it for better purposes, I guess.Other than my huge gripes with some of the film's messages and altogether pessimistic assumptions of human individualism, I think this was a very good movie.  The action scenes are state of the art, the sound editing is not flawless but still works, the art direction and cinematography are exactly what I want to see in this kind of movie, and the soundtrack works extremely well with everything else.  The performances of Stevenson, Oldman, and of course Denzel, are all great within this kind of movie, and maybe even a little bit beyond those expectations.  Microcosmically and more specifically in terms of its dialogue, the screenplay is also worthy of some praise.  I can even say that the unlikely twists at the end were both unpredictable and effective, however the final few seconds of the movie were not only unnecessary but actually kind of silly and out of place.It's a good all-around package, but if there is a niche audience hoping to see bloody machete/gun fights and some good old fashion bible-thumping, then it is going to be absolutely awesome for them.  In fact, all those Church groups that got together to seeThe Passion of the Christshould reunite for some more gore and god.  The Book of Eli requires faith in god and belief in the bible to enjoy what it is fully.  I'm not so sure I can give it more than a mixed review altogether though, because if I'm troubled by these messages I can only begin to imagine what others more critical of the institution of religion might actually think.  I'd simply like to think it's much more than the authority of the bible which makes us less primal than animals.",3,Entertaining but Self-Righteous Dystopian Thriller,1263686400,"01 17, 2010",2010,3406,"['now', ""'m"", 'sure', 'fan', 'Fallout', 'video', 'games', 'book', 'Eli', 'Denzel', 'Washington', 'protecting', 'Wasteland', 'Survival', 'Guide', 'Christian', 'bible', 'Book', 'Eli', 'surface', 'great', 'action', 'thriller', 'major', 'bummer', 'movie', 'terms', 'view', 'humankind', 'likeThe', 'Roadbut', 'only', 'humanity', 'religion', 'order', 'be', 'civilized', 'point', 'personally', 'despise', 'disagree', 'vehemently', 'Nevertheless', 'can', 'pretend', 'little', 'fictional', 'futuristic', 'world', 'word', 'god', 'imperative', 'else', 'become', 'cannibalistic', 'sociopaths', 'then', 'Book', 'Eli', 'can', 'be', 'forgiven', 'other', 'hand', 'will', 'take', 'fundamentally', 'preachy', 'storytelling', 'account', 'stern', 'critic', 'reasons', 'movie', 'bothered', 'deeply.The', 'year', '2043', 'world', 'been', 'post-apocalyptic', 'nightmare', 'thirty', 'years', 'Tribes', 'roam', 'wasteland', 'raping', 'pillaging', 'Eli', 'Washington', 'west', 'book', 'backpack', 'divine', 'intervention', 'protection', 'way', 'sexy', 'Mila', 'Kunis', 'acting', 'just', 'modeling', 'big', 'old', 'mean', 'Ray', 'Stevenson', 'who', 'naturally', 'rules', 'scene', 'Tom', 'Waits', 'one', 'favorite', 'musicians', 'who', 'futuristic', 'tinkerer', 'blind', 'Jennifer', 'Beals', 'who', 'most', 'women', 'here', 'constantly', 'damsel', 'distress', 'course', 'always', 'awesome', 'baddie', 'Gary', 'Oldman', 'who', 'very', 'best', 'Jack', 'Nicholson', 'still', 'piecing', 'together', 'seriously', 'cool', 'villainy', 'Obviously', 'are', 'major', 'spoilers', 'here', 'so', ""'ll"", 'keep', 'somewhat', 'restrained', 'Oldman', 'character', 'bent', 'finding', 'bible', 'using', 'control', 'civilization', 'Eli', 'hears', 'tell', 'bring', 'elsewhere', 'use', 'better', 'purposes', 'guess.Other', 'huge', 'gripes', 'film', 'messages', 'altogether', 'pessimistic', 'assumptions', 'human', 'individualism', 'think', 'was', 'very', 'good', 'movie', 'action', 'scenes', 'are', 'state', 'art', 'sound', 'editing', 'not', 'flawless', 'still', 'art', 'direction', 'cinematography', 'are', 'exactly', 'what', 'want', 'see', 'kind', 'movie', 'soundtrack', 'extremely', 'well', 'everything', 'else', 'performances', 'Stevenson', 'Oldman', 'course', 'Denzel', 'are', 'great', 'kind', 'movie', 'maybe', 'even', 'little', 'bit', 'expectations', 'Microcosmically', 'more', 'specifically', 'terms', 'dialogue', 'screenplay', 'also', 'worthy', 'praise', 'can', 'even', 'say', 'unlikely', 'twists', 'end', 'were', 'unpredictable', 'effective', 'however', 'final', 'few', 'seconds', 'movie', 'were', 'not', 'only', 'unnecessary', 'actually', 'kind', 'silly', 'place.It', 'good', 'all-around', 'package', 'niche', 'audience', 'hoping', 'see', 'bloody', 'machete/gun', 'fights', 'good', 'old', 'fashion', 'bible-thumping', 'then', 'going', 'be', 'absolutely', 'awesome', 'fact', 'Church', 'groups', 'got', 'together', 'seeThe', 'Passion', 'Christshould', 'reunite', 'more', 'gore', 'god', 'Book', 'Eli', 'faith', 'god', 'belief', 'bible', 'enjoy', 'what', 'fully', ""'m"", 'not', 'so', 'sure', 'can', 'give', 'more', 'mixed', 'review', 'altogether', ""'m"", 'troubled', 'messages', 'can', 'only', 'begin', 'imagine', 'what', 'others', 'more', 'critical', 'institution', 'religion', 'might', 'actually', 'think', ""'d"", 'simply', 'like', 'think', 'much', 'more', 'authority', 'bible', 'less', 'primal', 'animals']",N/A

To be as vague as possible the movie is about a man in this wasteland where there are gangs of scavengers trying to kill and steal from everyone.  He is trying to go west.  He has a book that is very important to him and he seems to not be a thief or a murderer and will kill only when it is in self defense.  There is a town that he arrives in that is ran by a guy named Carnagie played by Gary Oldman and he sees that he is different and able to dispatch his gangs of raiders with ease and want to recruit him.  That is as far as I will go with the plot.  To me anything else would spoil it.The acting was very well done.  I was surprized that the girl from the 70's show that was kelso's girl friend was so good.  I think her name is mila kunis or something like that.  Denzel was very good to watch and was as fun to watch when he wasn't speaking as when he was.  His facial expresions and mannerisms were acting he didn't have to tell you how he felt.  Gary Oldman was good as a guy trying to be powerfull and be in charge of the towns people and was a little crazy and mean.The action was well done too.  There was violence but it kind of showed shadows of the men after the first bloody limb being cut off as to avoid it being sick or some sort of twisted black comedy like kill bill.  The action was frantic and there were probably a well placed action scene about every 15min or so.

It's worth seeing if only for that good post-mortem that sends you to the diner arguing over french fries about the real meaning of the scene between Denzel Washington and Jennifer Beals.Otherwise, the film is ridiculously bleak and heavyhanded.  Tumbleweeds, check.  Sepia tones throughout, check.  Cannibals, check.  It is a patchwork of familiar elements that you have seen done better in a hundred other movies.  In one scene, Denzel is held captive in a cell-like room decorated only by a tattered poster from a long-ago 70s apocalypse film, Don Johnson in A Boy and His Dog--itself so much better than The Book of Eli it seemed almost as if the movie was taunting itself!  But instead it was probably intended as a homage...  Much of the movie was one homage stitched onto another...  When Mila Kunis made the sign of the cross to a leering Gary Oldman, it was so much like Bram Stoker's Dracula it was crazy!  And what about the old, decrepit desert house occupied by the two seniors, who call themselves George and Martha?  Their names recall the central couple in Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?, but why?Denzel, Gary Oldman, most of the actors were good, but against all odds.  The things they had to say and act out were ludicrous.  Defeated, perhaps by her character arc, perhaps by her own limitations, was poor Mila Kunis.  I thought Kylie Minogue, much as I love her, a bad actress, but Mila Kunis makes Kylie seem like Dame Judi Dench in comparison.  And yet, I wound up liking her just the same, especially when I read the interview with her that said in preparation for playing ""Solara"" opposite Denzel Washington, she had tried to read the Bible.  ""Which part?""  ""The first part.  Genesis.  But I just couldn't finish it.  It was good but it was boring.""

Maybe that everyone is 'out for themselves'. I was able to think of another movie it reminded me of (that used an evil movie to sell a moral tale or a religious theme - perhaps they all do) but can't remember it's title. I don't think it's completely true, but another reviewer called The Book of Eli 'without humanity'. All I can think to say is that even the bible concedes the Earth as the devil's playground.There's the question of whether this happens to include religion in a good story, or whether the film makers are using the story to sell religion. Or using either or both only to make money. Perhaps it doesn't matter. I liked the movie. I would make a guess they're trying to sell religion.The most interesting thing in the film (and perhaps what it's centered on) is the notion that the bible can be used to control or pacify the masses. If you can't believe this, perhaps you wont like the movie? Perhaps it works because it's a negative (tho powerful) view of the bible, the way it's presented here in the movie. Regardless, it worked for me. I'm good at suspending my disbelief. When I think about it seriously, though, it wouldn't work. In some kind of post-apocalyptic world - maybe. In today's world, forget it. You'd need something that speaks to people today, written in the manner people talk nowadays. That's what you need.Now I could write such a book. Sure.

This is how the story goes: In the not-too-distant future, some 30 years after the final war, a solitary man walks across the wasteland that was once America. Empty cities, broken highways, seared earth--all around him, the marks of catastrophic destruction. There is no civilization here, no law. The roads belong to gangs that would murder a man for his shoes, an ounce of water... or for nothing at all.But they're no match for this traveler.A warrior not by choice but necessity, Eli seeks only peace but, if challenged, will cut his attackers down before they realize their fatal mistake. It's not his life he guards so fiercely but his hope for the future; a hope he has carried and protected for 30 years and is determined to realize. Driven by this commitment and guided by his belief in something greater than himself, Eli does what he must to survive--and continue.Only one other man in this ruined world understands the power Eli holds, and is determined to make it his own: Carnegie, the self-appointed despot of a makeshift town of thieves and gunmen. Meanwhile, Carnegie's adopted daughter Solara is fascinated by Eli for another reason: the glimpse he offers of what may exist beyond her stepfather's domain.But neither will find it easy to deter him. Nothing--and no one--can stand in his way. Eli must keep moving to fulfill his destiny and bring help to a ravaged humanity.The cast led by Denzel Washington (who also produced) (as Eli) & Gary Oldman (as Carnegie) is great! The directing by The Hughes Brothers (Albert & Allen) (both of them also directed ""Menace II Society"" (1993, both also co-produced and wrote the story), ""Dead Presidents"" (1995, both also produced and wrote the story) & ""From Hell"" (2001, both also executive produced) is great!

From the overblown filter effects to the oh-so-epic shots of Denzel silhouetted against the sky, it's all overdone. The only real saving grace here is Oldman, enjoyably quirky as usual. But Kunis is ridiculous, barely an actress but real good at waltzing around post-apocalypse with her perfectly coiffed LA salon hairdo flowing in the breeze. Give me a break.Washington is solid as ever, no complaints there, but he really just doesn't have much to work with here in terms of script. The occasional sword and gunfight, a few long walks down the scorched road, a cannibal here and there, it's all good. Or not. And I hate movies that feature rape scenes or even threats of them, just to justify yet another revenge killing. So easy and so manipulative, and such lazy film making. The biblical overtones are barely explored, and poorly when they are. It's all a bunch of gobbledygook in the end and only Oldman made it worth watching for me after about 45 minutes.And what's up with the dynamic range on blu-rays and dvds lately? You can barely hear the dialogue and then suddenly BOOM BOOM BOOM!!!

1310988,A4SY5RCGC5CH9,B002ZG997C,"Maciej ""Darth Maciek""","[3, 4]","A man walks through desolate wilderness of a broken world. He suffers from thirst and hunger, wears rags and sleeps in ruins and other fortune hideouts. He must protect himself from the deadly blazing sun during the day and a not less deadly cold at night. He is lonely, as he crosses few people on the road - and amongst those he meets, most are thieves, bandits, madmen and cannibals. Although not yet old, he is not a young man anymore and his strength slowly abandons him. Scars and burns cover his skin, the stigmata of his personal Via Dolorosa. And he can not stop as he carries a heavy burden, and he would rather die than abandon it, as he must bring it to a safe place - which he didn't find yet. His name is Eli (Denzel Washington) and he has been walking like that for the last thirty years...""The book of Eli"", as one of the previous reviewers mentioned, is basically a mixture of ""Mad Max 2"" and ""The Road"", but with one very special element which distinguishes it from all other post-apocalyptic movies I saw - a very powerful Christian message. Because the burden Eli carries is the last Bible that exists in this devastated world. And two perils threaten this treasure - that it is destroyed, or even worse, that it fells into wrong hands...The wrong hands in this story belong to a certain Carnegie (Gary Oldman), a ruthless, cruel, but cunning and ambitious man, who rules tyrannically over the only ""town"" lost in the middle of desolation. His power is based mainly on the control of the only source of clean water in his vast domain. He used his power to gather a community in which people are protected from thirst, hunger and roaming cannibals - but where there is little freedom and where brutish thugs serving Carnegie are aristocracy, bulling the powerless plebeians. Carnegie wants to expand his domain and rise from a local boss to a king, but he is not certain if his little army can achieve that. He believes however, that if he owned a Bible and could preach its message to scattered remnants of humanity, he could become quite easily the supreme religious, political and military leader of a kingdom.The unavoidable confrontation between Eli and Carnegie includes some action scenes, but it is essentially spiritual and contains some very simple but powerful lessons. At one moment Eli recites the famous psalm 23: "" The Lord is my shepherd; I shall not want. He maketh me to lie down in green pastures: he leadeth me beside the still waters. He restoreth my soul: he leadeth me in the paths of righteousness for his name's sake. Yea, though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death; I will fear no evil: for thou art with me; thy rod and thy staff they comfort me. Thou preparest a table before me in the presence of mine enemies: thou anointest my head with oil; my cup runneth over. Surely goodness and mercy shall follow me all the days of my life; and I will dwell in the house of the Lord for ever."" And the whole movie is actually mostly an illustration of this prayer - a message of encouragement to the righteous.But there is also a warning for the wicked - even if you lay your hands on the greatest treasures of the Earth, soon they will turn to dust which will slip between your fingers... And the thing that I liked particularly in this movie, is that director and scenario writer decided, that the Almighty sometimes simply can not resist to play a particularly naughty, even vicious joke at the expense of the villains...)))Another great treasure of this movie is THE twist before the end, which changes completely the way we perceived EVERYTHING that happened before, a little like the revelation in the ""Sixth sense"" (but just to be precise, NO, it is not the same revelation!). This twist has its importance. I must humbly admit that in the beginning I was not thrilled by this film and I almost stopped watching it after 10 minutes - but I forced myself to continue and I was ultimately greatly rewarded. When the film was finished, I immediately rewatched it a second time, because once you know THE twist, the whole film is changed and it is really worthy to be seen again.Although this is mostly a Denzel Washington and Gary Oldman show, I also liked to see Jennifer Beals and Malcolm McDowell in smaller but important supporting roles. On another hand, Mila Kunis, although quite present on the screen, is not allowed to play a lot, as her character is there mainly to give Eli an occasion to speak and let us know a little about him and his story. It is not very fair for her, but she plays this auxilliary role with grace.Finally, I must admit that being a Christian I may not be entirely objective when reviewing this film and OK, maybe I liked it a little bit more than it desserves. But still, it made quite an impression on me and I can not give it anything less than five stars - and the final message of ""The book of Eli"", which is also the title of this review, taken from the New Testament, is splendid and a very powerful one.",5,"""I have fought the good fight, I have finished the race, I have kept the faith.""",1326672000,"01 16, 2012",2012,5000,"['man', 'desolate', 'wilderness', 'broken', 'world', 'thirst', 'hunger', 'rags', 'sleeps', 'ruins', 'other', 'fortune', 'hideouts', 'must', 'protect', 'deadly', 'blazing', 'sun', 'day', 'not', 'less', 'deadly', 'cold', 'night', 'lonely', 'few', 'people', 'road', 'amongst', 'most', 'are', 'thieves', 'bandits', 'madmen', 'cannibals', 'not', 'yet', 'old', 'not', 'young', 'man', 'anymore', 'strength', 'slowly', 'Scars', 'burns', 'cover', 'skin', 'stigmata', 'personal', 'Via', 'Dolorosa', 'can', 'not', 'stop', 'heavy', 'burden', 'would', 'rather', 'die', 'abandon', 'must', 'bring', 'safe', 'place', 'did', ""n't"", 'find', 'yet', 'name', 'Eli', 'Denzel', 'Washington', 'been', 'walking', 'last', 'thirty', 'years', 'book', 'Eli', 'one', 'previous', 'reviewers', 'mentioned', 'basically', 'mixture', 'Mad', 'Max', '2', 'Road', 'one', 'very', 'special', 'element', 'other', 'post-apocalyptic', 'movies', 'saw', 'very', 'powerful', 'Christian', 'message', 'burden', 'Eli', 'last', 'Bible', 'devastated', 'world', 'two', 'perils', 'threaten', 'treasure', 'destroyed', 'even', 'worse', 'wrong', 'hands', 'wrong', 'hands', 'story', 'belong', 'certain', 'Carnegie', 'Gary', 'Oldman', 'ruthless', 'cruel', 'cunning', 'ambitious', 'man', 'who', 'rules', 'tyrannically', 'only', 'town', 'lost', 'middle', 'desolation', 'power', 'based', 'mainly', 'control', 'only', 'source', 'clean', 'water', 'vast', 'domain', 'used', 'power', 'gather', 'community', 'people', 'are', 'protected', 'thirst', 'hunger', 'roaming', 'cannibals', 'where', 'little', 'freedom', 'where', 'brutish', 'thugs', 'serving', 'Carnegie', 'are', 'aristocracy', 'bulling', 'powerless', 'plebeians', 'Carnegie', 'expand', 'domain', 'rise', 'local', 'boss', 'king', 'not', 'certain', 'little', 'army', 'can', 'achieve', 'however', 'owned', 'Bible', 'could', 'preach', 'message', 'scattered', 'remnants', 'humanity', 'could', 'become', 'quite', 'easily', 'supreme', 'religious', 'political', 'military', 'leader', 'kingdom.The', 'unavoidable', 'confrontation', 'Eli', 'Carnegie', 'action', 'scenes', 'essentially', 'spiritual', 'very', 'simple', 'powerful', 'lessons', 'one', 'moment', 'Eli', 'famous', 'psalm', '23', 'Lord', 'shepherd', 'shall', 'not', 'want', 'maketh', 'lie', 'down', 'green', 'pastures', 'still', 'waters', 'restoreth', 'soul', 'paths', 'righteousness', 'name', 'sake', 'Yea', 'walk', 'valley', 'shadow', 'death', 'will', 'fear', 'evil', 'thou', 'art', 'rod', 'thy', 'staff', 'comfort', 'Thou', 'preparest', 'table', 'presence', 'mine', 'enemies', 'thou', 'head', 'oil', 'cup', 'runneth', 'Surely', 'goodness', 'mercy', 'shall', 'follow', 'days', 'life', 'will', 'dwell', 'house', 'Lord', 'ever', 'whole', 'movie', 'actually', 'mostly', 'illustration', 'prayer', 'message', 'encouragement', 'righteous.But', 'also', 'warning', 'wicked', 'even', 'lay', 'hands', 'greatest', 'treasures', 'Earth', 'soon', 'will', 'turn', 'dust', 'will', 'slip', 'fingers', 'thing', 'liked', 'particularly', 'movie', 'director', 'scenario', 'writer', 'decided', 'Almighty', 'sometimes', 'simply', 'can', 'not', 'resist', 'play', 'particularly', 'naughty', 'even', 'vicious', 'joke', 'expense', 'villains', 'great', 'treasure', 'movie', 'THE', 'twist', 'end', 'completely', 'way', 'perceived', 'EVERYTHING', 'happened', 'little', 'revelation', 'Sixth', 'sense', 'just', 'be', 'precise', 'NO', 'not', 'same', 'revelation', 'twist', 'importance', 'must', 'humbly', 'admit', 'beginning', 'was', 'not', 'thrilled', 'film', 'almost', 'stopped', 'watching', '10', 'minutes', 'forced', 'continue', 'was', 'ultimately', 'greatly', 'rewarded', 'When', 'film', 'was', 'finished', 'immediately', 'rewatched', 'second', 'time', 'once', 'know', 'twist', 'whole', 'film', 'changed', 'really', 'worthy', 'be', 'seen', 'mostly', 'Denzel', 'Washington', 'Gary', 'Oldman', 'show', 'also', 'liked', 'see', 'Jennifer', 'Beals', 'Malcolm', 'McDowell', 'smaller', 'important', 'supporting', 'roles', 'hand', 'Mila', 'Kunis', 'quite', 'present', 'screen', 'not', 'allowed', 'play', 'lot', 'character', 'there', 'mainly', 'give', 'Eli', 'occasion', 'speak', 'let', 'know', 'little', 'story', 'not', 'very', 'fair', 'auxilliary', 'role', 'grace.Finally', 'must', 'admit', 'being', 'Christian', 'may', 'not', 'be', 'entirely', 'objective', 'when', 'reviewing', 'film', 'OK', 'maybe', 'liked', 'little', 'bit', 'more', 'still', 'made', 'quite', 'impression', 'can', 'not', 'give', 'anything', 'less', 'five', 'stars', 'final', 'message', 'book', 'Eli', 'also', 'title', 'review', 'taken', 'New', 'Testament', 'splendid', 'very', 'powerful', 'one']",N/A

This book is greatly desired by Carnegie (a greasy Gary Oldman), who is also old enough to remember the power such a tome can have over the people.  While Eli has been wandering for thirty years in pursuit of such a destination, Carnegie has been sending illiterate henchmen to retrieve every book he can find.  The encounter between the two has all the fire and brimstone of a battle between heaven and hell.Thrown into the mix is Solara (played beautifully by Mila Kunis, who finally sheds her trademark accent), a young, attractive girl who has grown up under Carnegie's protection but, as she flowers into womanhood, is about to become a bargaining chip, a piece of meat, and a lure.  When there's no one left to protect her, she becomes a wanderer in Eli's footsteps.From a religious point of view, it's educational to understand who Eli was in the Bible. In the Bible, Eli's children are cursed for behaving wickedly, a parallel for the war that destroyed civilization in the movie. God's curse assures that all men will ""die by the sword"" - in the movie Eli expertly cuts a bloody swath through his enemies with his machete. In the Bible, it was the job of Eli's sons to guard the Ark of the Covenant - the pact God made with man - just as Eli guards the holy book in the movie.There's a twist ending that's not a twist of all if you read up about Eli in the Bible. But don't - watch the movie, then do some research, then watch the movie again.  Like Eli's quest for spiritual fulfillment, the experience will be rather eye-opening.",5,Eye-opening,1265155200,"02 3, 2010",2010,2347,"['Book', 'Eli', 'vastly', 'underappreciated', 'film', 'martial', 'arts', 'swordsmanship', 'post-apocalyptic', 'setting', 'biblical', 'narrative.A', 'war', 'thirty', 'years', 'ago', 'killed', 'off', 'many', 'people', 'United', 'States', 'Others', 'were', 'blinded', 'blast', 'interesting', 'disparity', 'thirty', 'years', 'age', 'who', 'received', 'education', 'thirty', 'who', 'know', 'nothing', 'modern', 'world', 'one', 'point', 'one', 'thugs', 'What', 'television', '.This', 'unpleasant', 'world', 'Cannibalistic', 'brigands', 'ambush', 'unwary', 'travelers', 'identifiable', 'shaking', 'hands', 'Water', 'premium', 'Batteries', 'are', 'hard', 'find', 'Book', 'Eli', 'clear', 'currency', 'only', 'barter.Roaming', 'land', 'Eli', 'subdued', 'Denzel', 'Washington', 'carrying', 'book', 'cross', 'book', 'greatly', 'desired', 'Carnegie', 'greasy', 'Gary', 'Oldman', 'who', 'also', 'old', 'enough', 'remember', 'power', 'tome', 'can', 'have', 'over', 'people', 'Eli', 'been', 'wandering', 'thirty', 'years', 'pursuit', 'such', 'destination', 'Carnegie', 'been', 'sending', 'illiterate', 'henchmen', 'retrieve', 'book', 'can', 'find', 'encounter', 'two', 'fire', 'brimstone', 'battle', 'heaven', 'hell.Thrown', 'mix', 'Solara', 'played', 'beautifully', 'Mila', 'Kunis', 'who', 'finally', 'trademark', 'accent', 'young', 'attractive', 'girl', 'who', 'grown', 'up', 'Carnegie', 'protection', 'womanhood', 'become', 'bargaining', 'chip', 'piece', 'meat', 'lure', 'When', 'one', 'left', 'protect', 'wanderer', 'Eli', 'footsteps.From', 'religious', 'point', 'view', 'educational', 'understand', 'who', 'Eli', 'was', 'Bible', 'Bible', 'Eli', 'children', 'are', 'cursed', 'behaving', 'wickedly', 'parallel', 'war', 'destroyed', 'civilization', 'movie', 'God', 'curse', 'men', 'will', 'die', 'sword', 'movie', 'Eli', 'expertly', 'bloody', 'swath', 'enemies', 'machete', 'Bible', 'was', 'job', 'Eli', 'sons', 'guard', 'Ark', 'Covenant', 'pact', 'God', 'made', 'man', 'just', 'Eli', 'holy', 'book', 'movie.There', 'twist', 'ending', 'not', 'twist', 'read', 'up', 'about', 'Eli', 'Bible', 'do', ""n't"", 'watch', 'movie', 'then', 'do', 'research', 'then', 'watch', 'movie', 'again', 'Eli', 'quest', 'spiritual', 'fulfillment', 'experience', 'will', 'be', 'rather', 'eye-opening']",N/A

El-Hewie""","[5, 10]","If you were born Mormon, the Book of Eli comes close to describe the Mormons' escape to the west to establish their identity. The only difference was that Joseph Smith believed that people turned black on the first day of the last millennium due to their sins. This movie made a black man the only survival who could recite the Holy Book and preserve it from extinction. The movie replicated the Islamic depiction of the preservation of the Quran by a black man after the death of the prophet. At the end of the movie, the producer did not miss placing the Bible next to the Quran on the same shelf.The chaos that ensued between wars that turned humans into illiterate, belligerent, and ruthless species embodies the turmoil that prevailed in both Mecca, when the Quran was inspired by Muhammad, and Pennsylvania, where the immense space and vast land inspired Joseph Smith to write his own Bible. Eli recites the same shadow of the Holy Ghost that inspired in him the Holy words. Those words kept Eli alive in the `valleys of death' that dominated the land after the wars.The movie dwelled on the classic gray and brown colors to convey the somber predicaments of a human race struck by loss of its intellectual leaders, statesmen, army, and police. The guns, knives, and arrows became the essential tools of warding off ruthless muggers, killers, and robbers. While poverty, illiteracy, and diseases struck the masses, the written words retained their esoteric power to subdue the illiterate, diseased, and desperate wars' survivors. Without the submission of the masses to few men of knowledge, chaos perpetuates disasters, and civilization regresses to the dark ages. Water became the most precious commodity. People ate the flesh of their fellow humans.As Muhammad migrated to the North of Mecca to revive the Quran and escape persecution, Smith and Eli migrated West to resurrect the Holy Bible. Faith kept Eli walking on the roads for thirty years to his destiny in San Diego where he found the right folks who could scribe his Holy words.  Eli rests in piece after his mission was accomplished. One major glitch was that Eli killed too many people in order to survive to deliver his Holy book to the hands that could preserve it. Muhammad on the other hand never wrote the Quran, but rather lived and taught the Quran to transform stray followers to the right path. Muhammad was illiterate but his words and deeds subdued the most influential figures in Mecca and Medina including those who recorded the Quran after Muhammad's death. Returning to Joseph Smith, the Book of Mormon got Smith killed for his failure to proved the real evidence of the source of his revelation.Eli's prophecy holds credence on the basis of its high probability, viewed in the context of the existence of weapons of mass destruction in the hands of governments that lack the scrutiny of the people it governs. The Anthrax scare that caused the loss of few lives has never been traced to its roots despite its occurrence in the center of the American government and its highly sophisticated laboratories. Nor could any reasonable person deny that all governments cover up on their internal failure and corruption. When mass destruction ensues, figures like Eli would fit the role perfectly. His swift action, lack of trust, and faith in destiny saved him in the final days of judgment.The Saturday show when the movie opened, the theatre was fully packed. Only one woman with her 10 year old exited as the gruesome scenes of murders kept coming. The classic art, the biblical notion, the richness in action and killing, attracted many viewers. Of course, Stalin's book was displayed to show the need for a mass murderer that could bring chaos to order. Kentucky Fried Chickens ' wet towels and another commercial gum also capitalized on the advertisement opportunities of the big name Eli.The modernization of the ""Message"" by Anthony Quinn, in a cowboy epic of highly powered guns, explosive, destruction, excessive murder, and very rich artistic sceneries made the movie appeal to the short attention span of the contemporary generation.It is all about the BOOK, the Holy words, and the power of conviction that civilization rises and falls.",5,A mix between Mormonism and Islamism in a cowboy style.,1263686400,"01 17, 2010",2010,4228,"['were', 'born', 'Mormon', 'Book', 'Eli', 'close', 'describe', 'Mormons', 'escape', 'west', 'establish', 'identity', 'only', 'difference', 'was', 'Joseph', 'Smith', 'believed', 'people', 'turned', 'black', 'first', 'day', 'last', 'millennium', 'due', 'sins', 'movie', 'made', 'black', 'man', 'only', 'survival', 'who', 'could', 'recite', 'Holy', 'Book', 'preserve', 'extinction', 'movie', 'replicated', 'Islamic', 'depiction', 'preservation', 'Quran', 'black', 'man', 'death', 'prophet', 'end', 'movie', 'producer', 'did', 'not', 'miss', 'placing', 'Bible', 'next', 'Quran', 'same', 'shelf.The', 'chaos', 'ensued', 'wars', 'turned', 'humans', 'illiterate', 'belligerent', 'ruthless', 'species', 'turmoil', 'prevailed', 'Mecca', 'when', 'Quran', 'was', 'inspired', 'Muhammad', 'Pennsylvania', 'where', 'immense', 'space', 'vast', 'land', 'inspired', 'Joseph', 'Smith', 'write', 'own', 'Bible', 'Eli', 'same', 'shadow', 'Holy', 'Ghost', 'inspired', 'Holy', 'words', 'words', 'kept', 'Eli', 'alive', 'valleys', 'death', 'dominated', 'land', 'wars.The', 'movie', 'dwelled', 'classic', 'gray', 'brown', 'colors', 'convey', 'somber', 'predicaments', 'human', 'race', 'struck', 'loss', 'intellectual', 'leaders', 'statesmen', 'army', 'police', 'guns', 'knives', 'became', 'essential', 'tools', 'warding', 'off', 'ruthless', 'muggers', 'killers', 'robbers', 'poverty', 'illiteracy', 'struck', 'masses', 'written', 'words', 'retained', 'esoteric', 'power', 'subdue', 'illiterate', 'diseased', 'desperate', 'wars', 'survivors', 'submission', 'masses', 'few', 'men', 'knowledge', 'chaos', 'perpetuates', 'disasters', 'civilization', 'regresses', 'dark', 'ages', 'Water', 'became', 'most', 'precious', 'commodity', 'People', 'ate', 'flesh', 'fellow', 'humans.As', 'Muhammad', 'migrated', 'North', 'Mecca', 'revive', 'Quran', 'escape', 'persecution', 'Smith', 'Eli', 'migrated', 'West', 'resurrect', 'Holy', 'Bible', 'Faith', 'kept', 'Eli', 'walking', 'roads', 'thirty', 'years', 'destiny', 'San', 'Diego', 'where', 'found', 'right', 'folks', 'who', 'could', 'scribe', 'Holy', 'words', 'Eli', 'piece', 'mission', 'was', 'accomplished', 'One', 'major', 'glitch', 'was', 'Eli', 'killed', 'too', 'many', 'people', 'order', 'survive', 'deliver', 'Holy', 'book', 'hands', 'could', 'preserve', 'Muhammad', 'other', 'hand', 'never', 'wrote', 'Quran', 'rather', 'lived', 'taught', 'Quran', 'transform', 'stray', 'followers', 'right', 'path', 'Muhammad', 'was', 'illiterate', 'words', 'deeds', 'subdued', 'most', 'influential', 'figures', 'Mecca', 'Medina', 'including', 'who', 'recorded', 'Quran', 'Muhammad', 'death', 'Returning', 'Joseph', 'Smith', 'Book', 'Mormon', 'got', 'Smith', 'killed', 'failure', 'proved', 'real', 'evidence', 'source', 'revelation.Eli', 'prophecy', 'credence', 'basis', 'high', 'probability', 'viewed', 'context', 'existence', 'weapons', 'mass', 'destruction', 'hands', 'governments', 'lack', 'scrutiny', 'people', 'Anthrax', 'scare', 'caused', 'loss', 'few', 'lives', 'never', 'been', 'traced', 'roots', 'occurrence', 'center', 'American', 'government', 'highly', 'sophisticated', 'laboratories', 'could', 'reasonable', 'person', 'deny', 'governments', 'cover', 'up', 'internal', 'failure', 'corruption', 'When', 'mass', 'destruction', 'ensues', 'figures', 'Eli', 'would', 'fit', 'role', 'perfectly', 'swift', 'action', 'lack', 'trust', 'faith', 'destiny', 'saved', 'final', 'days', 'judgment.The', 'Saturday', 'show', 'when', 'movie', 'opened', 'theatre', 'was', 'fully', 'packed', 'Only', 'one', 'woman', '10', 'year', 'old', 'exited', 'gruesome', 'scenes', 'murders', 'kept', 'coming', 'classic', 'art', 'biblical', 'notion', 'richness', 'action', 'killing', 'attracted', 'many', 'viewers', 'course', 'Stalin', 'book', 'was', 'displayed', 'show', 'need', 'mass', 'murderer', 'could', 'bring', 'chaos', 'order', 'Kentucky', 'Fried', 'Chickens', 'wet', 'towels', 'commercial', 'gum', 'also', 'capitalized', 'advertisement', 'opportunities', 'big', 'name', 'Eli.The', 'modernization', 'Message', 'Anthony', 'Quinn', 'cowboy', 'epic', 'highly', 'powered', 'guns', 'explosive', 'destruction', 'excessive', 'murder', 'very', 'rich', 'artistic', 'sceneries', 'made', 'movie', 'appeal', 'short', 'attention', 'span', 'contemporary', 'generation.It', 'BOOK', 'Holy', 'words', 'power', 'conviction', 'civilization', 'rises', 'falls']",N/A

I had just found out a few days prior that the book he is carrying is suppose to be the last Bible on the Earth, so I kind of had an idea where this movie might be going, but it delved even deeper into the religious aspects than I had expected. There are a few well shot and brutal action scenes (I loved that silhouetted fight that didn't have one editing cut) and the cast is pretty solid. Denzel Washington doesn't say much and lets his machete do most of the talking, but his performance was good enough to make me care for Eli as a character. Gary Oldman is always a treat to watch in any role and he plays a a creepy, confident and compelling bad guy here, without going too over-the-top. Mila Kunis is fine as well (enough to forgive her for Max Payne), which really surprised me. While her looks alone seem to get her movie roles, at least her acting here is almost on par.As you can see from the trailers, the whole movie has a sepia color tone, though it isn't as distracting as I had assumed it would be. There are some very nice visual shots from the Hughes Brothers and the set design, along with some of the locations are top of the line. Some might find parts of the film slow moving, but I liked the comfortable way it flowed. The twist at the end has been cut down by a number of critics, but it really caught me by surprise and I thought it worked in the sense that Eli always seemed to be more than normal man to begin with.The Book of Eli isn't great entertainment from start to finish, but it gives you a little to think about in between the limbs being hacked off.

1311014,ADE3FENV9TFDS,B002ZG997C,Movie Lover,"[11, 22]","*** This review may contain spoilers ***On the whole, I have not been impressed with Denzel's body of work since he won his second Oscar forTraining Day (Snap Case), and this film does nothing to reverse that trend.In this, he plays a lone warrior wandering a post-apocalyptic wasteland, but unlike most other protagonists in films like this, he actually has a place to go and something to do. I won't say where he's going or why, but he's been doing it for over 30 years, which quite possibly makes him the hero with the worst sense of direction ever (has he ever heard of a map and compass?). But I digress.It starts interestingly enough, establishing his character in some ways you don't usually see. Of course he is a good fighter, as you have to be in a world like this, but then he unheroically leaves a couple of fellow wanderers to the untender mercies of some roaming bikers after dealing with a larger group of bandits. What, now he's afraid to fight? I suppose that, given his purpose, that can be excused, but that's still a bit hard to swallow.Anyway, he comes across a small town ruled by the iron fist of Gary Oldman, whose great power is that he can...read. That's not a typo, he can read, and that is apparently all the power he needs. We never once see him do anything that shows his evil nature, unless you count him raising his voice against a couple of women and pulling on the hair of a blind Jennifer Beals.

1311021,A18SDN3HYFVH2L,B002ZG997C,Muzzlehatch,"[2, 9]","Super-bad dude (Denzel Washington) is walking west through an entirely typical post-apocalyptic desert landscape.  It's all shot on digital video, and for once the format looks just right for the gray, washed-out landscapes.  After wasting a bunch of thugs with a wicked long knife/short sword, Denzel wanders into a one-horse town run by a nasty boss-type guy played by who else?  Ben Gazzara.  No, just kidding, but Gary Oldman is channeling him I think.  Heck, I dunno, maybe there's just a generic amoral town boss type and everybody tends towards it if they play these roles enough.Also in the town are Tom Waits as a shopkeeper (entertaining for his few minutes of time but wasted) and Mila Kunis as the daughter of Oldman's blind kept woman, Jennifer Beals.  After Denzel goes all Toshiro Mifune on a bunch of Oldman's men who've just returned from raiding, Oldman takes an interest; and after finding out that Denzel has a precious book, he's even more interested.  You want to guess what the book is?  I don't think you'll find it too hard...This is a rather silly and derivative movie that vacillates between various tough guy genres - post-apocalyptic science fiction, spaghetti western, samurai film.  The after-the-end-of-the-world stuff doesn't come off as much different than what we've seen in dozens of films from A BOY AND HIS DOG through MAD MAX and this past year's THE ROAD - gray deserts, shattered towns and cities, little animal or vegetable life, dust, hopelessness.  The close-in fighting sequences feel like updated Kurosawa, and sharp-eared viewers will note that one of Oldman's henchmen whistles the theme from Sergio Leone's ONCE UPON A TIME IN AMERICA at a couple of points during the film.  Denzel  is doing the taciturn, emotionless staring type of anti-hero best exemplified by Clint Eastwood in the ""Dollars"" trilogy, though he brings his own particular kind of charisma and even a certain warmth the role; he and Mila Kunis (somewhat miscast I think but trying her best and looking a bit too lovely in this grimy environment) are certainly the main reasons I saw the film and I can't say I was disappointed in them.Besides all the tough-guy stuff and macho posturing though, the film wants to be - and say - something more.  Problem is that in the resolution (which I'm not going to spoil for ya) that something more has to be taken so literally and absolutely for the film to work that if you don't want to believe it (and it IS a matter of belief) you'll probably just find it all laughable.  And the film doesn't play out for the most part as a comedy - it's a lot more serious than most spaghetti westerns, even solemn at times.  Then again, you could just have fun with Denzel doing Clint Eastwood, Steve McQueen and any number of other macho action figures and maybe that's enough.On a certain level, though, this film clearly wants to be taken seriously, wants to be something more than just a mindless action romp; the Hughes brothers who directed it haven't exactly shied away from Christian themes in their previous films, and here they are front and center and obvious.  You don't talk so much about religion - the Bible, specifically - if you don't have some kind of agenda.  But it's so damn muddled, and so careful to try to straddle various lines in order to have as wide an appeal as possible that I'm not sure it was worth it.  And in the final analysis, if this guy is carrying around a Bible and the message he's getting is ""kill anyone who stands in my way"", what does that say about the book, humanity, or this film?",3,"Denzel makes this silly film with a ridiculous ending worth it, just about",1264809600,"01 30, 2010",2010,3574,"['Super-bad', 'dude', 'Denzel', 'Washington', 'walking', 'west', 'entirely', 'typical', 'post-apocalyptic', 'desert', 'landscape', 'shot', 'digital', 'video', 'once', 'format', 'just', 'right', 'gray', 'washed-out', 'landscapes', 'wasting', 'bunch', 'thugs', 'wicked', 'long', 'knife/short', 'sword', 'Denzel', 'one-horse', 'town', 'run', 'nasty', 'boss-type', 'guy', 'played', 'who', 'else', 'Ben', 'Gazzara', 'No', 'just', 'kidding', 'Gary', 'Oldman', 'channeling', 'think', 'Heck', 'dunno', 'maybe', 'just', 'generic', 'amoral', 'town', 'boss', 'type', 'everybody', 'towards', 'play', 'roles', 'enough.Also', 'town', 'are', 'Tom', 'Waits', 'shopkeeper', 'entertaining', 'few', 'minutes', 'time', 'wasted', 'Mila', 'Kunis', 'daughter', 'Oldman', 'blind', 'kept', 'woman', 'Jennifer', 'Beals', 'Denzel', 'Toshiro', 'Mifune', 'bunch', 'Oldman', 'men', 'who', ""'ve"", 'just', 'returned', 'raiding', 'Oldman', 'interest', 'finding', 'out', 'Denzel', 'precious', 'book', 'even', 'more', 'interested', 'want', 'guess', 'what', 'book', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', ""'ll"", 'find', 'too', 'hard', 'rather', 'silly', 'derivative', 'movie', 'various', 'tough', 'guy', 'genres', 'post-apocalyptic', 'science', 'fiction', 'spaghetti', 'western', 'samurai', 'film', 'after-the-end-of-the-world', 'stuff', ""n't"", 'come', 'off', 'as', 'much', 'different', 'what', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'dozens', 'films', 'A', 'BOY', 'AND', 'HIS', 'DOG', 'MAD', 'MAX', 'past', 'year', 'THE', 'ROAD', 'gray', 'deserts', 'shattered', 'towns', 'cities', 'little', 'animal', 'vegetable', 'life', 'dust', 'hopelessness', 'close-in', 'fighting', 'sequences', 'feel', 'updated', 'Kurosawa', 'sharp-eared', 'viewers', 'will', 'note', 'one', 'Oldman', 'henchmen', 'theme', 'Sergio', 'Leone', 'ONCE', 'A', 'TIME', 'IN', 'AMERICA', 'couple', 'points', 'film', 'Denzel', 'doing', 'taciturn', 'emotionless', 'staring', 'type', 'anti-hero', 'best', 'exemplified', 'Clint', 'Eastwood', 'Dollars', 'trilogy', 'own', 'particular', 'kind', 'charisma', 'even', 'certain', 'role', 'Mila', 'Kunis', 'miscast', 'think', 'trying', 'best', 'looking', 'bit', 'too', 'lovely', 'grimy', 'environment', 'are', 'certainly', 'main', 'reasons', 'saw', 'film', 'ca', ""n't"", 'say', 'was', 'disappointed', 'them.Besides', 'tough-guy', 'stuff', 'macho', 'posturing', 'film', 'be', 'say', 'something', 'more', 'Problem', 'resolution', ""'m"", 'not', 'going', 'spoil', 'ya', 'something', 'more', 'be', 'taken', 'so', 'literally', 'absolutely', 'film', 'work', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'believe', 'matter', 'belief', ""'ll"", 'probably', 'just', 'find', 'laughable', 'film', ""n't"", 'play', 'out', 'most', 'part', 'comedy', 'lot', 'more', 'serious', 'most', 'spaghetti', 'westerns', 'even', 'solemn', 'times', 'Then', 'again', 'could', 'just', 'have', 'fun', 'Denzel', 'doing', 'Clint', 'Eastwood', 'Steve', 'McQueen', 'number', 'other', 'macho', 'action', 'figures', 'maybe', 'enough.On', 'certain', 'level', 'though', 'film', 'clearly', 'be', 'taken', 'seriously', 'be', 'something', 'more', 'just', 'mindless', 'action', 'romp', 'Hughes', 'brothers', 'who', 'directed', 'have', ""n't"", 'exactly', 'shied', 'away', 'Christian', 'themes', 'previous', 'films', 'here', 'are', 'front', 'center', 'obvious', 'do', ""n't"", 'talk', 'so', 'much', 'religion', 'Bible', 'specifically', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'kind', 'agenda', 'so', 'damn', 'muddled', 'so', 'careful', 'try', 'straddle', 'various', 'lines', 'order', 'have', 'wide', 'appeal', 'possible', ""'m"", 'not', 'sure', 'was', 'worth', 'final', 'analysis', 'guy', 'carrying', 'Bible', 'message', 'getting', 'kill', 'anyone', 'who', 'way', 'what', 'say', 'book', 'humanity', 'film']",N/A

Take The Book of Eli for example: a post-apocalyptic action vehicle that comes off being better than it rightfully should be thanks to the starpower of Washington, who plays the enigmatic, and dangerous, wanderer Eli.  Eli is westward bound and carrying a precious text that soon becomes coveted by the maniacal Carnegie (Gary Oldman) after Eli sets foot in his town.  It isn't long before Eli and young Solara (Mila Kunis) are on the run, all the while dodging other hazards of the barren wasteland.  While The Book of Eli hardly offers anything new to the post-apocalyptic thriller or action genres, it does feature some gorgeous cinematography and camera work, as well as the most inspired direction to come from The Hughes Brothers since Menace II Society.  The action sequences are violent and surprisingly creative, and Washington manages to be equal parts charasmatic and stoic: he truly makes the film as worthwhile as it is.  Oldman is his usual good villainous self, Kunis is easy on the eyes, and supporting turns from Ray Stevenson, Jennifer Beals, and Tom Waits round things out nicely.

I took that to be a positive thing.Only one of the two items listed above turned out to be true.Let me cut straight to the chase- you take the religious aspect out of this movie and you're left with an average flick with bad pacing, ZERO character development, and poor directing.What does it matter if it's The Bible or not? It's about a dude carrying a book and headed West because that's what god wants him to do. That's the story right there. And then you've got Meg from Family Guy teaming up with him, who rivals Kate Bosworth in Superman Returns as far as epic miscastings go.**Usually in a movie where you're following one central character in a huge, lonely world, you really get engrossed with that character and really care about what happens next. Here they forgot about character development so nothing really mattered. We're just watching Denzel with glasses and a beard.**While the fighting scenes were flashy, I don't like their choice of how they shot it, or portrayed his character. It's definitely fun to see Denzel as a total badass on-screen, but I don't get how his fighting skills are up to the level of being able to dispatch enemies in seemingly mere nano-seconds with absolutely RAZOR SHARP precision and accuracy, with NO MISTAKES. With or without the spoiler, that still doesn't explain it. This portrayal took away from the realism and made him seem like some superhero, or invincible. Was there any explanation given as to why he's able to operate in this manner? Was it because god was protecting him? That's a cop out answer. Is god the answer to anything that can't be explained with rational logic? Oh wait..**Denzel and Meg from Family Guy had no chemistry in this movie. She plays the cookie cutter 'young, attractive girl fascinated by mysterious older man' role to a tee.**How is it that a no name wannabe movie critic can see a a movie and easily point out the number of unnecessary (and embarrassing) slow motion shots in a movie, yet professional movie makers can't, and in fact, readily DOUSES the movie in it.**My reviews aren't complete until I whine and moan about a character's decisions and illogical actions in a movie. Well we're at that point. The morning after Meg from Family Guy leaves Denzel's cell and goes to see her mother and Gary Oldman, she gets questioned by Gary Oldman about whether or not Denzel had a book. Just look at this scene, she could've EASILY just lied and said no. But instead, here she is cowering like a mindless retard, even as her mother gets threatened, she's standing there as if she's trying hard to hold in a secret, when in fact, all she had to do was adamantly state that THERE WAS NO BOOK and she has no idea what he's talking about. The kind of actions seen here would be the kind where some powerful mind reading overlord has someone captured, and that captured person knows that the overlord can easily see past his lies due to his supernatural abilities, so when questioned, he's very hesitant to lie because he knows the repercussions of lying, and so is more or less paralyzed with fear, not knowing whether lying or telling the truth would be the better choice.

Only one copy of the Bible remains in existence and that is the property of Eli who maintains that he must ""head West"" under the guidance of a voice he has heard ""from within himself"" so that he may find an appropriate place for the Bible.  A series of massive gun fights ensue and a couple George and Martha (Washington?) are brought into the matter which occurs in an epic showdown between Eli, the girl, George and Martha, and the rest of the gang looking for the Book outside of a white house.  Eli is wounded but the girl manages to escape; however, the leader has managed to attain the Book despite the fact that he has been injured.  Eli manages to head further West with the girl where he encounters a second remaining society.  This society has a library set up and seeks to spread all human knowledge to the world again through its printing press.  The library contains much of Western culture including books by Shakespeare and the music of Wagner as well as Britannica encyclopedias.  Eli tells the girl that he contains the Bible in his heart and begins dictating the entire Bible to an old wisened librarian who eventually is to complete the entire dictation thus preserving forever knowledge of the Bible (which will be set to the printing press).  In the meantime, after trying to pick the lock on his own Bible the leader of the town discovers that the Bible is written in Braile.  He attempts to have his blind mistress read it for him but she refuses.  Eventually the illiterate men of his town are to revolt against their master.  In the meantime, Eli slowly dies of the wound inflicted upon him but not before completing the entire Bible.  In this manner, the Bible and teachings of Christ will be passed on to a future post-apocalyptic generation.  Earlier in the film Eli had noted that in the war of the past books were burned and destroyed with the exception of the Bible.  I feel that this may be a reference to the internet in which books are pillaged and information is ripe for rampant abuse.  At the end of the film, the girl manages to set out back for home carrying her mission from Eli to return home.  I felt this film was spiritually fulfilling a vacuous post-apocalyptic world.  Eli notes that in the world before the apocalypse people had much but did not appreciate what they had.  His personal faith is quite touching in light of the hostility to such faith in the modern world.  The end of the movie explains the importance of cultural and religious preservationism and through the medium of the printing press the Bible and the Gospel of Christ will continue to live on a for a future generation of people.My main criticism of the film is the excessive violence that Eli delivers in brutally killing animals for food and his opponents in battle.  Eli spares none and carries a sharp blade which he uses to torture and kill all his opponents.  I felt that this was somewhat unbecoming in a film about spiritual truth that emphasizes the golden rule.  The harshness and violence of the film detract from the overall message I felt and for this reason I only gave the film 4 stars.",4,Spiritually Sustaining in a Empty Wasteland.,1280620800,"08 1, 2010",2010,3772,"['_The', 'Book', 'Eli_', '2010', 'starring', 'Denzil', 'Washington', 'prophet', 'Eli', 'world', 'destroyed', 'war', 'brought', 'religion', 'hate', 'Few', 'humans', 'remain', 'left', 'water', 'become', 'scarce', 'commodity', 'Many', 'humans', 'have', 'resorted', 'cannibalism', 'who', 'attack', 'wandering', 'Eli', 'are', 'quickly', 'despatched', 'savage', 'blade', 'Eli', 'town', 'where', 'able', 'teach', 'young', 'girl', 'religious', 'belief', 'pray', 'God', 'However', 'leader', 'town', 'impose', 'will', 'upon', 'people', 'been', 'searching', 'copy', 'Bible', 'may', 'use', 'evil', 'ends', 'also', 'enjoy', 'biographies', 'Mussolini', 'Only', 'one', 'copy', 'Bible', 'existence', 'property', 'Eli', 'who', 'must', 'head', 'West', 'guidance', 'voice', 'heard', 'so', 'may', 'find', 'appropriate', 'place', 'Bible', 'A', 'series', 'massive', 'gun', 'fights', 'ensue', 'couple', 'George', 'Martha', 'Washington', 'are', 'brought', 'matter', 'epic', 'showdown', 'Eli', 'girl', 'George', 'Martha', 'rest', 'gang', 'looking', 'Book', 'outside', 'white', 'house', 'Eli', 'wounded', 'girl', 'escape', 'however', 'leader', 'managed', 'attain', 'Book', 'fact', 'been', 'injured', 'Eli', 'head', 'further', 'West', 'girl', 'where', 'second', 'remaining', 'society', 'society', 'library', 'set', 'up', 'spread', 'human', 'knowledge', 'world', 'again', 'printing', 'press', 'library', 'contains', 'much', 'Western', 'culture', 'including', 'books', 'Shakespeare', 'music', 'Wagner', 'as', 'well', 'Britannica', 'encyclopedias', 'Eli', 'girl', 'Bible', 'heart', 'dictating', 'entire', 'Bible', 'old', 'wisened', 'librarian', 'who', 'eventually', 'complete', 'entire', 'dictation', 'thus', 'preserving', 'forever', 'knowledge', 'Bible', 'will', 'be', 'set', 'printing', 'press', 'meantime', 'trying', 'pick', 'lock', 'own', 'Bible', 'leader', 'town', 'discovers', 'Bible', 'written', 'Braile', 'have', 'blind', 'mistress', 'read', 'Eventually', 'illiterate', 'men', 'town', 'are', 'revolt', 'master', 'meantime', 'Eli', 'slowly', 'wound', 'inflicted', 'not', 'completing', 'entire', 'Bible', 'manner', 'Bible', 'teachings', 'Christ', 'will', 'be', 'passed', 'future', 'post-apocalyptic', 'generation', 'Earlier', 'film', 'Eli', 'had', 'noted', 'war', 'past', 'books', 'were', 'burned', 'destroyed', 'exception', 'Bible', 'feel', 'may', 'be', 'reference', 'internet', 'books', 'are', 'pillaged', 'information', 'ripe', 'rampant', 'abuse', 'end', 'film', 'girl', 'set', 'out', 'back', 'home', 'carrying', 'mission', 'Eli', 'return', 'home', 'felt', 'film', 'was', 'spiritually', 'fulfilling', 'vacuous', 'post-apocalyptic', 'world', 'Eli', 'notes', 'world', 'apocalypse', 'people', 'had', 'much', 'did', 'not', 'appreciate', 'what', 'had', 'personal', 'faith', 'quite', 'touching', 'light', 'hostility', 'such', 'faith', 'modern', 'world', 'end', 'movie', 'importance', 'cultural', 'religious', 'preservationism', 'medium', 'printing', 'press', 'Bible', 'Gospel', 'Christ', 'will', 'continue', 'live', 'future', 'generation', 'people.My', 'main', 'criticism', 'film', 'excessive', 'violence', 'Eli', 'delivers', 'brutally', 'killing', 'animals', 'food', 'opponents', 'battle', 'Eli', 'none', 'sharp', 'blade', 'torture', 'kill', 'opponents', 'felt', 'was', 'somewhat', 'unbecoming', 'film', 'spiritual', 'truth', 'golden', 'rule', 'harshness', 'violence', 'film', 'detract', 'overall', 'message', 'felt', 'reason', 'only', 'gave', 'film', '4', 'stars']",N/A

1311028,A2CMLBIKBG9EMP,B002ZG997C,Norman R. Sahm,"[5, 8]","I'm still ambivelent about this film, ""The Book of Eli"".  Visually, the directors succeed in painting a totally stark, blasted, and scorched-earth wasteland.  ""Life"" has been reduced to a constant struggle for survival - food, water, shelter, and protection.As the film progresses, you discover bits and pieces of what happened to produce a world like what you are viewing - obviously some kind of nuclear war - but, also you get hints about book burnings - particularly religious writings - which were blamed, by some, as the cause for the war and the resulting devestation.Enter Eli, who is guarding some kind of book, who believes he has been told ""by a voice"" to take the book west.  Also, we meet Carnegie, a violent, ambitious leader of a large gang that has control of at least one city.  Carnegie is searching for a particular book that he believes will give him control over the masses of people.  We even get a hint that prior to the war, Carnegie was some kind of ""successful"" religious preacher.  We soon discover that the book Eli is guarding is the very one that Carnegie desparately desires.So, we have two people who both cherish the Book, but for vastly different reasons.  Eli sincerely believe's the Book's message - he attempts to live by it - he wants to spread the book's message to as many people as possible because he believes it contains the Truth and that only by following its teachings will people find true meaning for life and real peace with one's self, Man and God.  Carnegie wants the book to use for his own purposes - to sway and use people in order to achieve power and control.  The Book to him is only a means to get what he wants - he doesn't really believe it's message - he isn't going to live by it's message - he just values it for it's influence over people.I'm still mulling over the messages of the film, but it does make you think and the story pulls you in.  The film's major theme, I believe, is that although there are ""wolves in sheep's clothing"" mascarading as ""servants"" of God - don't reject the Truth because of the fakes.  Be discerning about who or what you put your faith in.  Truth can be used for good or for evil.Overall, I think this movie is definitely worth watching - good acting, good pacing, good plot and character development - interesting twist toward the end.

1311035,A16C1J5AW2CDRE,B002ZG997C,O Shepard,"[5, 12]","'The Book of Eli' has a promising start. We meet Denzel Washington as  Eli walking a post-apocalyse wasteland 30 years in the future very much like the depiction in 'The Road'. He is walking carrying a book that we immediate recognize as the Bible. In case we missed the close-up of the hasped leather bound volume, Denzel gives us plenty of biblical references and quotations.The viewer's suspension of disbelief is  somewhat challenged from the start. Denzel sports shades, odd considering that the planet is shown overcast, grey, dead, and dark. He even wears his sunglasses in dark interior scenes. And unlike Viggo Mortensen in The Road, who literary starved himself to portray the almost dead,skeletal man, Denzel looks pretty good for surviving 30 years of the end of the world. In fact all the characters, except for a couple of cannibals he meets towards the film's last third, look pretty good. If the sunglasses don't amuse you, consider that Denzel also listens to an iPod as he wanders. Not a current iPod but the original iPod. Wow! What a machine to last perhaps 40 years. Steve Jobs needs to use that clip in Apple's advertising.It gets worse. Sunglasses seem to be a readily available commodity in this destroyed future. Everybody has a pair. Yet, the book that has had millions upon millions of copies printed around the world, the Bible, is not to be found except in the hands of Eli. Suspension of disbelief becomes impossible after a while. Perhaps you can rationalize the availability of ammo and gasoline  after 30 years, even mascara and eye shadow, but how do you rationalize that the roadbed still has painted white lines on them? And worse, the entire film after the first 20 minutes, and the exception of the very end of the film, is shot through a brown sepia-tone filter. At least in 'The Road', the Director of Photography found believable realistic looking desolation.Denzels' acting is wooden and uninspired. Luckily, the rest of the cast is quite good, especially Gary Oldman, who carries this film. I wondered if Denzel's acting style in this film was copied from Clint Eastwood's 'Pale Rider'. Often, we the viewers, are just not sure if Eli is truly human. His fighting abilities and accuracy with a pistol at long distances are surely supernatural. Bullets bounce of him, at least in one fight scene, and when he he shot point blank by Oldman, we see a flash of lightning in the sky. Is Eli supposed to be a ghost? Jesus? We are not even sure if he can see or if he is blind.'The Book of Eli' is a well produced film that lifts ideas from other films such as 'The Road', 'Mad Max: Beyond Thunderdome', and 'Fahrenheit 451'. But it ultimately fails. The so-called surprise ending was no surprise at all if you were paying attention. The climax was telegraphed half-way into the movie if you could not guess it from the title itself. And without revealing the ending here, anyone who has worked with the kind of book revealed at the end knows how lame it is to  suggest that the book carried by Eli is the entire King James Bible.UPDATE OF SORTS -I have been asked several times what is wrong with the ending of the film.

Do Amazon think I might be Benjamin Button and be growing younger, or perhaps I am testament to the education system that Wexford is producing very erudite and splenetic 12 years olds? I digress....""Can I tell you about the word of our Lord""?Is one phrase that thankfully that Eli managed to avoid. The following also does not appear..Washington ""Can I interest you in a Watchtower?""Oldman ""No thanks, I'm quite happy with my hotel thank you"".Its 30 years in the future, the bombs fell, the world ended, nuclear fire blossomed and the fire of the sun scorched the earth. The stunned survivors roamed shooting, gouging and murdering each other, civilisation fell, the wheels of industry stopped turning, and yet still, the roads in The Book of Eli are still in better condition than those we have in Wexford.The world was broken some 30 years previously when some sort of war occurred and probably destroyed the ozone layer causing the world to be flooded with UV light. In the short term, everybody got a lovely tan, but in the long term, everyone who managed not to live underground for a year died. A year?? Who on earth could live underground for an entire year?In the intervening years, the lazy good for nothing folk of Carnegie's town had done nothing at all to tidy up the place, it looked like a ruin, there's no excuse for living in a ruin, its sheer laziness.Eli is wandering around the place lugging a Bible that he reads from lovingly every night, as he listens to his IPod, not you understand, one of those crappy ones that break down after 5 minutes, but one that lasts for 30 years, before he has to recharge it, perhaps it is solar powered or something? Tom Waits was actually tasked with recharging it during the film, but presumably resisted the temptation to load any of his own tunes onto it.The other thing that everyone has is a supply of cool sunglasses, which is great. I don't know how they do it; I lose mine all the time.And the last thing you would probably want to see in the post apocalyptic world is some bloke with a Bible. I mean, thinking about all of the wars caused in the name of religion, the Inquisition, the Crusades, oppression of people and cleric abuse, an outbreak of organised religion would be the last thing I would like to see. And what is the big deal? The folk he meets in the town  could have the following conversation. Observe.Townsman - ""Howdee stranger, what have you got there?""Eli ""I have a Bible"".Townsman ""What's that all about then? What happens at the end?""Eli - ""Why, Revelations, Armageddon, the end of the world!!!""Townsman (expansively indicating the post apocalyptic landscape) ""Seen it already.""Anyhoo, Carnegie (Gary Oldman) decides that the bible represents a handbook to dominate and oppress and entirely new market segment, and he might well have been right. You see, the survivors of the apocalypse had destroyed every other copy of the Bible in America, so this is the last one.  Even those Gideon ones. Oldman lives in a town centre hotel, he might like to have checked his bedside table, which would have been ironic if there was one there all the time.Oldman wants the Bible; Washington has a higher calling for it. Shenanigans ensue. There is some chopping, a bit of stabbing, some shooting.In the end, there is an ironic and moderately unexpected twist, which frankly on first viewing is really outstandingly daft, I mean mega daft, but the point of the film is faith, and so you have to take the silly twist on faith as well, which sort of makes it more bearable.I really rather liked the post apocalyptic setting of the film, its well done, the washed out colour and the utter devastation is nicely realised. Oldman and Washington are solid in their performances, the fight scenes are well realised without being graphic, for me, who loves the post apocalyptic genre, this was an enjoyable film, and recommended.

1311040,A11TUHEHHENLBC,B002ZG997C,"Patrick L. Boyle ""Mr. Wonderful""","[4, 6]","This is a movie made in the spirit of other movies not the spirit of reality. That's OK. Its entertaining because it indulges in well proven tropes. So kick back, put your brain in neutral and enjoy.The very first thing on screen is the cat. Most of the reviewers refer to it as a feral cat. In fact it's a purebred sphynx cat. This is a hairless breed that has a lot of health problems. It certainly couldn't survive in the wild today much less in the chilly post apocalyptic future. But that's OK. It immediately signals to the audience that this is just a fantasy.Denzel is of course an old man. In real life he's in his late fifties and he looks it. Before modern medicine the life expectancy was about thirty six. In a post apocalyptic world old men like him would have a hard time just staying alive. One little scratch could lead to a terminal infection. But it's OK. It is possible for an occasional old man to survive, if he was careful.But of course Denzel isn't careful. He has a tendency to find himself surrounded by groups of armed men intent on his destruction. He seems incapable of recognizing danger soon enough so as to avoid a face to face confrontation. But it's OK, Denzel is a great swordsman and pistolero and archer etc...In movies samurai style sword fighting is the most effective. In reality of course the Samurai were never successful in battle against anyone other than a Samurai and the Samurai sword was a lousy sword. But it's OK, Samurai style sword fighting may not be effective but it is certainly cinematic.Later Denzel is surrounded once again by adversaries - this time with guns. Then Denzel eschews his sword and pulls out his pistol and shotgun. You might wonder why in his previous encounters he had endangered himself by fighting masses of armed men in close quarters when he could have shot them from a distance. Saving ammo? But it's OK, not only can no bad guy cut him with a sword, ax or chain saw, no one can hit him with a bullet either. Ray Stevenson the top bad guy fighter who shoots apparently without regard to scarce ammunition can't seem to hit Denzel in the back from twenty feet - twice.Later yet Denzel shoots two baddies with his bow. You might think that he finally has decided to save ammunition, but no. He doesn't bother to retrieve his arrows but leaves them in the bodies for Gary Oldman to discover shortly. But it's OK, his bow is a ridiculously weak one. Even the small young woman tagging along can destring it with one hand.Next Denzel and the girl meet the cannibals (all such movies have cannibals). You might wonder why like Clint Eastwood in The Unforgiven someone doesn't just raise pigs. Not sure about that but like almost every other such movie the amazingly lethal action star wanders around in the desert and sooner or later meets some cannibals. But it's OK, Gary Oldman shows up and shoots the cannibals saving Denzel the trouble. Gary arrives with four Mad Max style DIY tanks. His most powerful weapon is somehow a Civil War vintage Gatling Gun - for which he apparently has plenty of ammunition.It's more than a little odd that there in this dystopian future everyone is armed with old weapons. Denzel has a WWII vintage canteen. Although he talks a lot about water both he and the girl seem to be able to hike across the desert for days sustained only on the one quart capacity of this canteen. Neat trick. But it's OK they also have WWII vintage grenades which somehow are incredibly powerful yet never endanger the thrower with shrapnel.The whole Bible trope was better done in ""A Canticle for Liebowitz"". Indeed the critics seem to be divided between those who think this movie is anti-Christian and those think it's a fundamentalist religious rant. But it's OK the book thingee is obviously just a McGuffin - as Hitchcock once explained - an arbitrary device that motivates the action.

Yes, I know the post-apocalypse world is supposed to be bleached and irradiated and scorched (this is why everyone has to wear sunglasses), but the brown tone just makes everything seem out of focus.Denzel Washington underacts. He is stoical to the point of somnolent. Even when he fights (which is a lot), he seems to be just going through the motions. By the way, in the many-on-one fight scenes (which are many), each bad guy carefully waits his turn to be stabbed or gored or pierced or otherwise impaled; none of them has the brilliant idea of ganging up.Gary Oldman overacts.

1311045,AZL8ZFJMYLSV3,B002ZG997C,P. Walker,"[3, 10]","I hesitated watching this film for dread that it would be some pseudo-religious mind screw, and was right. It's only redeeming qualities are Denzel Washington, Gary Oldman and a few blood and gore action scenes. The setting of the film is in the near future. Because of the division that religion creates, holy books (more specifically the Bible) have been gathered up and destroyed to prevent war, but alas, it is too little, too late. The world has become a post-apocalyptic nightmare, devastated by nuclear war. The earth is scorched, the atmosphere desiccated, and the planet is a now a barren desert. Small groups of humans struggle to survive among the ruins of the cataclysm. However, there seems to be hope. Among the survivors is a King James Bible and apparently only one black man, Eli. In what seems to be a weird paradoxical effort, Eli is trying to save the very book that has caused the destruction of the world and almost the extinction of mankind.The film does a decent job of revealing why holy books were written and used in the first place. Ancient peoples were in constant danger of being invaded or subjugated by other tribes and armies. They lived in continual fear of being annihilated and their culture destroyed and forgotten. There was always a threat, always an impending apocalypse which would drive men to fear and to reject others and commit horrible acts, much like you see in the film. We see the residual of this ingrained fear in those that embrace and believe ancient text today. Carnegie (Gary Oldman) seems to understand this and wants this power to create nationalism and loyalty for his purposes.Mankind has evolved to the point that they give imagination to their fears. It is man's ingrained fear of death and therefore his urge to conquer it that drives them. Men proselytize not to save others but to save themselves. Their fear of ""different"" drive men to convert everyone to their own beliefs and culture, then they believe they will finally be safe.Quoting only ""nice"" verses of the Bible throughout the film, Eli reveals himself to be some self-proclaimed ""book savior"". I would have loved to have seen the faces of the people around Eli when he quoted these verses:""But Rabshakeh said, Hath my master sent me to thy master and to thee to speak these words? hath he not sent me to the men that sit upon the wall, that they may eat their own d_ng, and drink their own p_ss with you?"" (Isaiah 36:12; 2 Kings 18:27)""For she doted upon their paramours, whose flesh (gen_tals) is as the flesh (genit_ls) of asses (donkeys), and whose issue (s_men) is like the issue (sem_n) of horses."" (Ezekiel 23:20)You should read the above verses in a modern translation to get the full disgusting impact of them. Moralists have censored and banned books for far less than these verses. For example, ""Catcher in the Rye"" was banned for containing the word ""wh_re"". The Bible (KJV) uses this word 15 times and the word ""harl_t"" 90 times. The Bible is filled with violence, murder, gore-filled bloodshed, suicide, pornography, misogyny, body mutilation, incest, pedophilia, genocide, racism, rape (including being raped to death by the men of a city), cannibalism (including boiling and eating their own baby), and many other terrible acts that I would not be allowed to write here. Many of these acts are portrayed in a positive and accepted manner of behavior. Yet, many people will give their children this book without the thought of what it contains. If theses stories were written in another book, these same people would condemn it.""And the LORD was with Judah; and he drove out the inhabitants of the mountain; but COULD NOT drive out the inhabitants of the valley, because they had chariots of iron."" - (Judges 1:19) ""...all things are possible with God."" - (Mark 10:27) Have you ever noticed how absurd, contradictory and illogical religious text can be. Yet, many people rarely, if ever, notice these contradictions, nor want to.The film embraces this sense of contradiction and leaves you with a feeling of ""here we go again"".

[Blu-ray], the United States did not recover. While viewing the movie, I often think that it's very similar to the games ""Fallout"" and ""Badlands"" - the future is indeed bleak.People compare it to other Dystopian movies - Mad Max and the like. Well, all post-apocalyptic Dystopian movies will share many similarities, from the dust-shrouded sky to dead vegetation, wandering gangs to small outposts run by the strongest and best armed. ""The Book of Eli"" does a better job than most. The environment is fantastic and believable, the de-evolution of society and technology dead-on. All colors are muted, almost sepia toned. Everything is gritty and dirty. Shampoo is worth it's weight in gold.If you enjoy this genre (post ""we killed 'em all, let God sort them out) and low-tech survivalist flicks, then this will not disappoint. It was much better thanThe Road (2009)- in story, plot, characters and effects.We don't see crumbling skylines - until the end. We don't explore dead cities. We join Eli at the end of a decades-long journey, and see a glimpse of the possible future.  I could have done without the religious rhetoric and Oldman's character (Carnegie) believing that the book is the answer to everything and the source of all power. Denzel Washington gave a surprisingly good performance outside his ""comfort zone"", and the sexy Mila Kunis was a believable supporting character. The cast had plenty of other well known actors, from Jennifer Beals to Ray Stevenson, plus a decent supporting cast.Every character was well cast and acted - none seemed out of place (think Matt Le Blanc in ""Lost in Space"" or John Wayne as Genghis Khan).This is one of those movies I'll watch when I can't think of something else (along with the Resident Evil series!)",5,"The Future is so bright, he has to wear shades!

In a very good way.Denzel Washington pulls off a subtle and understated performance as the lonely survivor of a cataclysmic event, as he moves with steady determination across dry desert landscapes - west, west, always west - protecting a book that he won't let anyone see. The other actors in the film are no slouches either, from Gary Oldman capturing the wonderfully twisted man in charge (recalling his bent cop from 'The Professional' for me) to Mila Kunis in a sidekick role that has impressive depth to Michael Gambon as a paranoid old man armed to the teeth and more.The tone of the cinematography matches that of Denzel's character, harsh and raw and blasted into wide-open silences. The music carries us along in this vein as well, menacing and stark.The action sequences are shot elegantly, almost like a dance - though often a dance where limbs fly and the dance only ends when the bodies stop twitching. These scenes do, however, stretch credibility to the absolute breaking point, as Denzel faces off against multiple enemies repeatedly and rarely gets a scratch. There is a possible reason for this explained about halfway into the film, but it comes too late and explains too little. This is probably the only weakness in a story that is otherwise impressive and unexpected.The final scenes are simply a marvel of storytelling, and almost perfectly executed.The wonderful thing about 'The Book of Eli' is the discovery of it. It methodically blasts away at every glimmer of hope...it does not flinch or look away. But then there is one who holds on. One who walks west, one who protects a single book with his life, one who will not give up, even when everyone around him already has.For a film to express the ideas of hope and faith while avoiding trite, saccharine sentiments completely isn't just impressive - it's practically a revelation.",4,"Faith, Hope, and the Word",1306454400,"05 27, 2011",2011,2264,"['Do', ""n't"", 'let', 'first', '30', 'minutes', 'so', ""'The"", 'Book', 'Eli', 'fool', 'off', 'bleak', 'moody', 'mix', 'other', 'post-apocalyptic', 'stories', ""'Mad"", 'Max', ""'The"", 'Road', 'time', 'credits', 'roll', ""'ll"", 'see', 'heart', 'cracked', 'lot', 'story', 'uncover', ""'The"", 'Book', 'Eli', 'more', 'initially', 'expected', 'themes', 'ideas', 'expressed', 'here', 'surprised', 'very', 'good', 'way.Denzel', 'Washington', 'off', 'subtle', 'understated', 'performance', 'lonely', 'survivor', 'cataclysmic', 'event', 'steady', 'determination', 'dry', 'desert', 'west', 'west', 'always', 'west', 'protecting', 'book', 'wo', ""n't"", 'let', 'anyone', 'see', 'other', 'actors', 'film', 'are', 'slouches', 'either', 'Gary', 'Oldman', 'capturing', 'wonderfully', 'twisted', 'man', 'charge', 'recalling', 'bent', 'cop', ""'The"", 'Professional', 'Mila', 'Kunis', 'sidekick', 'role', 'impressive', 'depth', 'Michael', 'Gambon', 'paranoid', 'old', 'man', 'armed', 'teeth', 'more.The', 'tone', 'cinematography', 'Denzel', 'character', 'harsh', 'raw', 'blasted', 'wide-open', 'silences', 'music', 'along', 'vein', 'as', 'well', 'menacing', 'stark.The', 'action', 'sequences', 'are', 'shot', 'elegantly', 'almost', 'dance', 'though', 'often', 'dance', 'where', 'limbs', 'fly', 'dance', 'only', 'when', 'bodies', 'stop', 'twitching', 'scenes', 'do', 'however', 'stretch', 'credibility', 'absolute', 'breaking', 'point', 'Denzel', 'off', 'multiple', 'enemies', 'repeatedly', 'rarely', 'scratch', 'possible', 'reason', 'explained', 'halfway', 'film', 'too', 'late', 'too', 'little', 'probably', 'only', 'weakness', 'story', 'otherwise', 'impressive', 'unexpected.The', 'final', 'scenes', 'are', 'simply', 'marvel', 'storytelling', 'almost', 'perfectly', 'executed.The', 'wonderful', 'thing', ""'The"", 'Book', 'Eli', 'discovery', 'methodically', 'away', 'glimmer', 'hope', 'not', 'flinch', 'look', 'away', 'then', 'one', 'who', 'One', 'who', 'west', 'one', 'who', 'single', 'book', 'life', 'one', 'who', 'will', 'not', 'give', 'up', 'even', 'when', 'everyone', 'already', 'film', 'express', 'ideas', 'hope', 'faith', 'avoiding', 'trite', 'saccharine', 'sentiments', 'completely', ""n't"", 'just', 'impressive', 'practically', 'revelation']",N/A

1311057,A2R1HAXRNU0QX7,B002ZG997C,RMurray847,"[3, 9]","The world following the apocalypse has become a nearly barren desert, populated by loosely knit groups of humans who cling to survival with dirty talons, and make little effort to cling to civilization.  Many drive modified motorcycles.  Into this desolation wanders a lonely figure, reluctantly on a journey that urges him to disassociate from humanity in favor of headlong movement across the landscape.  He is also a ferocious fighter when he needs to be, and under the hard exterior is capable of feeling a need for companionship and meaning.Nope, I'm not describing THE ROAD WARRIOR.  I'm not talking about THE ROAD.  I'm talking about the very unoriginal THE BOOK OF ELI, starring Denzel Washington as the mysterious man Eli who is compelled to walk ever Westward across a landscape wrecked by nuclear war...where there are few survivors and many of them have turned to cannibalism.  He carries a book with him that is unique in what is left of mankind, and he believes that he must deliver this into the right hands.On his path, he is frequently beset by violence...but fortunately, he has almost superhuman hand-to-hand fighting skills (and a very sharp sword), so that he can easily defeat 6 or more hardened, experienced fighting men in about 20 seconds flat.He wanders into a town, where the self-appointed mayor (Gary Oldman) happens to be looking for the very book that Eli happens to be carrying.  Eli escapes, but is accompanied (much to his chagrin) by a spunk young lady (Mila Kunis) who is drawn to Washington's gentleness and probably by a chance to ""see the world.""  The two must fight off efforts to bring them back to this town, save the book and deliver it to the location Eli feels God has told him to bring it.ELI is filmed in a washed out, sepia-toned manner, and is virtually devoid of any other color.  There are lots of shots of Eli moving across the barren land, and plenty of moments where he just stands in place and looks cool.  Denzel Washington has charisma to burn, and it is this charisma that makes the film watchable.  We immediately take to this quiet, mysterious man...because we immediately are drawn to Washington.  Washington talks very little, and except for two or three short bursts of action...seems to DO very little.  Yet he's fairly riveting, and that's due simply to his presence.  He doesn't so much give a performance as he gives a persona.Were a lesser actor than Washington in this film, it would just be a slow-moving, sepia colored, B-level post-apocalyptic chore of a movie.  There's very little that's honestly original, and surprisingly little actual action.  I expected more fighting, but got very little when it was all said and done.  Gary Oldman, who has been such a great villain over the years, really never makes much of a foreboding presence.  We get that he's a bit crazy and a lot dangerous, but it feels vague and unspecific.  Surprisingly, Jennifer Beals makes a nice impression as Oldman's ""girlfriend"" and Mila Kunis' mother.  Kunis is working up an interesting film resume, having been credible now in things as diverse as ELI & FORGETTING SARAH MARSHALL.  I'm not ready to put her on the A-list yet, but I also never thought the kid who played Jackie on THAT `70s SHOW would have a viable film career.  She's actually pretty good, and towards the end of the film, has some nice moments with Washington which finally give the film a long overdue shot of human emotion.In the end, your enjoyment of this movie will depend a lot on how much you like either a) Washington or b) post-apocalyptic films, no matter how derivative of far better films.  While I didn't mind the time I spent watching THE BOOK OF ELI...my time would have been better spent re-watching THE ROAD WARRIOR...the film that after all these years is STILL the gold-standard in this little subgenre.",3,Denzel Washington more or less redeems this very unoriginal film,1263772800,"01 18, 2010",2010,3841,"['world', 'following', 'apocalypse', 'become', 'nearly', 'barren', 'desert', 'populated', 'loosely', 'knit', 'groups', 'humans', 'who', 'cling', 'survival', 'dirty', 'talons', 'make', 'little', 'effort', 'cling', 'civilization', 'Many', 'drive', 'modified', 'motorcycles', 'desolation', 'lonely', 'figure', 'reluctantly', 'journey', 'disassociate', 'humanity', 'favor', 'headlong', 'movement', 'landscape', 'also', 'ferocious', 'fighter', 'when', 'be', 'hard', 'exterior', 'capable', 'feeling', 'need', 'companionship', 'meaning.Nope', ""'m"", 'not', 'describing', 'THE', 'ROAD', 'WARRIOR', ""'m"", 'not', 'talking', 'ROAD', ""'m"", 'talking', 'very', 'unoriginal', 'THE', 'BOOK', 'OF', 'ELI', 'starring', 'Denzel', 'Washington', 'mysterious', 'man', 'Eli', 'who', 'compelled', 'walk', 'ever', 'Westward', 'landscape', 'wrecked', 'nuclear', 'war', 'where', 'are', 'few', 'survivors', 'many', 'have', 'turned', 'cannibalism', 'book', 'unique', 'what', 'left', 'mankind', 'must', 'deliver', 'right', 'hands.On', 'path', 'frequently', 'beset', 'violence', 'fortunately', 'almost', 'superhuman', 'hand-to-hand', 'fighting', 'skills', 'very', 'sharp', 'sword', 'so', 'can', 'easily', 'defeat', '6', 'more', 'hardened', 'experienced', 'fighting', 'men', '20', 'seconds', 'flat.He', 'wanders', 'town', 'where', 'self-appointed', 'mayor', 'Gary', 'Oldman', 'be', 'looking', 'very', 'book', 'Eli', 'be', 'carrying', 'Eli', 'accompanied', 'much', 'chagrin', 'spunk', 'young', 'lady', 'Mila', 'Kunis', 'who', 'drawn', 'Washington', 'gentleness', 'probably', 'chance', 'see', 'world', 'two', 'must', 'fight', 'off', 'efforts', 'bring', 'back', 'town', 'save', 'book', 'deliver', 'location', 'Eli', 'feels', 'God', 'told', 'bring', 'it.ELI', 'filmed', 'washed', 'out', 'sepia-toned', 'manner', 'virtually', 'devoid', 'other', 'color', 'are', 'lots', 'shots', 'Eli', 'moving', 'barren', 'land', 'plenty', 'moments', 'where', 'just', 'place', 'cool', 'Denzel', 'Washington', 'charisma', 'burn', 'charisma', 'film', 'watchable', 'immediately', 'take', 'quiet', 'mysterious', 'man', 'immediately', 'are', 'drawn', 'Washington', 'Washington', 'very', 'little', 'two', 'three', 'short', 'bursts', 'action', 'DO', 'very', 'little', 'fairly', 'riveting', 'due', 'simply', 'presence', ""n't"", 'so', 'much', 'give', 'performance', 'persona.Were', 'lesser', 'actor', 'Washington', 'film', 'would', 'just', 'be', 'slow-moving', 'sepia', 'colored', 'B-level', 'post-apocalyptic', 'chore', 'movie', 'very', 'little', 'honestly', 'original', 'surprisingly', 'little', 'actual', 'action', 'expected', 'more', 'fighting', 'got', 'very', 'little', 'when', 'was', 'said', 'done', 'Gary', 'Oldman', 'who', 'been', 'great', 'villain', 'years', 'really', 'never', 'much', 'foreboding', 'presence', 'get', 'bit', 'crazy', 'lot', 'dangerous', 'vague', 'unspecific', 'Surprisingly', 'Jennifer', 'Beals', 'nice', 'impression', 'Oldman', 'girlfriend', 'Mila', 'Kunis', 'mother', 'Kunis', 'working', 'up', 'interesting', 'film', 'resume', 'having', 'been', 'credible', 'now', 'things', 'as', 'diverse', 'ELI', 'FORGETTING', 'SARAH', 'MARSHALL', ""'m"", 'not', 'ready', 'put', 'A-list', 'yet', 'also', 'never', 'thought', 'kid', 'who', 'played', 'Jackie', 'THAT', '70s', 'SHOW', 'would', 'have', 'viable', 'film', 'career', 'actually', 'pretty', 'good', 'end', 'film', 'nice', 'moments', 'Washington', 'finally', 'give', 'film', 'long', 'overdue', 'shot', 'human', 'emotion.In', 'end', 'enjoyment', 'movie', 'will', 'depend', 'lot', 'how', 'much', 'Washington', 'b', 'post-apocalyptic', 'films', 'matter', 'how', 'derivative', 'far', 'better', 'films', 'did', ""n't"", 'mind', 'time', 'spent', 'watching', 'THE', 'BOOK', 'OF', 'ELI', 'time', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'better', 'spent', 're-watching', 'THE', 'ROAD', 'WARRIOR', 'film', 'years', 'STILL', 'gold-standard', 'little', 'subgenre']",N/A

In Alcatraz we see Eli sitting down with McDowell and dictating the entire Bible to him.Using old printing presses,a book is produced and carefully shelved among other pieces of religious material.As the film ends Eli has passed away and his companion is wearing some of his accoutrements as she heads back home.The film is shot entirely in a washed out sepia tone and proves quite effective is setting a certain feeling and look throughout.While the premise is certainly interesting I found the going could get a little on the slow side at times,and the ending of the film especially got a little more drawn out than it should have.Remember we are dealing with a subject matter here that has been done over and over again,especially in the past few years,so I was personally looking for something special that would set this one apart from all the rest.I really didn't find much.However Washington does his usual good job in his role and he is ably assisted by the likes of Tom Waits,Oldman and McDowell in a small role near the end.Watch for Jennifer Beals in a surprise and nice role as Oldman's woman.Also for you Harry Potter fans,look closely at that old couple in the house...nuff said.Technically speaking the film is in its w/a a/r of 2:35:1 and is clear and crisp.Extras include a deleted/alternate scene and a comic/cartoon about the back story to Oldman's charcater with the voices of Oldman and Washington.All in all another in a long line of post apocalyptic films with a very good cast and some surprise cast members.But it is not original enough to set

To me, the unheralded star of this film is the cinematographer--this film is an amazing collection of images that are stunning in their power.  From the opening scene with the cat until the end of the film, we're treated to a fascinating display of segments that help immensely to establish mood, move the story forward, and keep us looking forward to more.  Anyone studying filmmaking should watch this to learn a lot about potential techniques.I loved the story, and the twist at the end is as good as the wedding ring in ""The Sixth Sense.""  To the filmmakers' credit, by the time we learn what we learn, it's actually believable in a literary sense.  Who cares about logic and the definition of ""impossible"" based on our limited knowledge--this story takes us past what we think we know and gets us to thinking about what may be.Denzel Washington does a great job bringing us Eli, and the supporting cast also hits their roles dead on.  The violence is never gratuitous, and they do a good job of not rubbing our faces in it to shock us into repulsion.In spite of the reviewers who will have you believe otherwise, this is not a ""Christian"" propaganda film--all of the Bible verses quoted are from the Old Testament (except a bit of the Lord's Prayer, I believe), and the Old Testament is not of Christian origin.  Rather, this is a tale of true faith, of putting trust in God and seeing the benefits of maintaining that trust.  And no matter what our religious beliefs, this is one of the themes that has occurred in all types of literature since people began writing.All in all, highly recommended as a film that will make you think and feel about life in different ways, a film that points out what life could be like if we lose all that we have--so let's appreciate it all while we have it, instead of taking it for granted!",5,Great film!,1288483200,"10 31, 2010",2010,1912,"['enough', 'here', 'story', 'acting', 'wo', ""n't"", 'go', 'much', 'unheralded', 'star', 'film', 'cinematographer', 'film', 'amazing', 'collection', 'images', 'are', 'stunning', 'power', 'opening', 'scene', 'cat', 'end', 'film', ""'re"", 'treated', 'fascinating', 'display', 'segments', 'help', 'immensely', 'establish', 'mood', 'move', 'story', 'forward', 'keep', 'looking', 'forward', 'more', 'Anyone', 'studying', 'filmmaking', 'should', 'watch', 'learn', 'lot', 'potential', 'techniques.I', 'loved', 'story', 'twist', 'end', 'as', 'good', 'wedding', 'ring', 'Sixth', 'Sense', 'filmmakers', 'credit', 'time', 'learn', 'what', 'learn', 'actually', 'believable', 'literary', 'sense', 'Who', 'logic', 'definition', 'impossible', 'based', 'limited', 'knowledge', 'story', 'what', 'think', 'know', 'thinking', 'what', 'may', 'be.Denzel', 'Washington', 'great', 'job', 'bringing', 'Eli', 'supporting', 'cast', 'also', 'roles', 'dead', 'violence', 'never', 'gratuitous', 'do', 'good', 'job', 'not', 'rubbing', 'shock', 'repulsion.In', 'spite', 'reviewers', 'who', 'will', 'have', 'believe', 'otherwise', 'not', 'Christian', 'propaganda', 'film', 'Bible', 'verses', 'quoted', 'are', 'Old', 'Testament', 'bit', 'Lord', 'Prayer', 'believe', 'Old', 'Testament', 'not', 'Christian', 'origin', 'Rather', 'tale', 'true', 'faith', 'putting', 'trust', 'God', 'seeing', 'benefits', 'maintaining', 'trust', 'matter', 'what', 'religious', 'beliefs', 'one', 'themes', 'occurred', 'types', 'literature', 'people', 'began', 'writing.All', 'highly', 'recommended', 'film', 'will', 'make', 'think', 'feel', 'life', 'different', 'ways', 'film', 'out', 'what', 'life', 'could', 'be', 'lose', 'have', 'let', 'appreciate', 'have', 'instead', 'taking', 'granted']",N/A

The scenes are not crowded with detail, it seems Kubricesque at times in it sparseness, but there is still plenty to take in in the sets and backdrops. This film is well worth seeing for its vision alone.  Denzel is aging well as an actor, and gosh I sure hope his age is augmented for the films sake because I hate to think of him getting old!

What's the goal?  Even he is not sure.  Just that he'll know it when he sees it.  He carries the book in his bag and protects it at all costs.The world is a rough place after the bombs dropped.  The giant crater holes, the broken fragments of Man's civilization to where people have degraded to biker gangs and every person for themselves.Only the older men and women who are literate have any hold on anyone else.  Books were burned and banned soon after the war to ""prevent this from happening again.""  Clearly a Fahrenheit 451 reference.  Keep the people ignorant and they can be more easily controlled.Gary Oldman plays a guy who is running a town where he knows this is true.  He gets his biker gangs to go out and search for the book.  The Book that will get him control over the masses.  Using the words from the Bible will get him to raise up and take control over the cities in his area.  From history it is not the first time that faith in the Bible and religion has led to control over populations.But the film is not saying that Oldman's character is right.  In fact, the selfless faith is what triumphs at the end.And what an ending there is!  Can't spoil it, sorry.The younger people in the film, the woman that befriends him and others, cannot read and have never learned to read.  The biker gang leaders can't read and they don't care -- they'll kill, rape and steal for a decent barter & trade.  The woman can't read either, but wants to know of the old days.  She starts out as a lousy character, frankly, but then develops into a strong character near the end of the film.The photography with the washed-out colors and the sepia toned landscape and people was wonderfully shot and along with the stark music, gives a depressing yet hopeful mood.Favorite scenes:The silhouette where Denzel is whipping out his blade and slicing and dicing the bad guys, hand flies off, a few gut slices and blood splashes.  Yuk.The stark, barren landscape, the blackened craters.  The sun so bright that everyone has to wear shades (apparently the ozone layer has been wiped out).The old couple in a farm house who have a different taste in meat than most.  :)This is not a religious film.  It's not even a film of having a religion.  It's about knowledge.  The smart, literate ones know the way to rebuild.  The illiterate ones want only to survive.  The stupid, literate ones want power.Will Eli live long enough to see his dream happen?

Saul ""opinionated, yet  truthful, mu...","[21, 54]","Here's the premise...In a post apocolyptic world, Denzel Washington is this mysterious apostle/keeper of the faith who roams around the country heading ""west"". When confronted, he's practically a superhero who can take on anybody and any amount of attackers. He's carrying around a Bible which is supposed to represent ""hope"" in this lawless, wasteland of a world. Gary Oldman, on the othe hand, is a power hungry villain who recognizes that the Bible would be an excellent tool in suppressing others, creating fear and justifying existing turmoil. He wants Denzel's Bible.There's two ways to evaluate this loathsome movie.1) As pure entertainment, it's terrible. The movie is, for the most part boring, the combat sequences are overstylish and the plot has no resolution, as though they did not where to go with this. The charactors, dialogue, and themes are preposterous.2) In taking this as a serious metaphor for religion, it's even worse. While I'm not a big fan of organized religion, it can be argued that if this movie was supposed to be a proponent of organized religion, it seriously backfires. This movie paints the use of the Bible in mostly evil terms. Gary Oldman practically spews the Marxian view that ""religion is the opium of the masses"" in explaining why the Bible would be so powerful in his hands. Even the Denzel Washington charactor, who is supposed to be righteous with his  intentions for his Bible, really does not act as that much of a hero within the film.There's brutality and violence that does not justify a purpose, charactor development on people that end up not being worthy of the development and a ridiculous conclusion.This movie came out around the same time as ""The Road"", another overly dark, post apocolyptic film. That film, if the ""end of the world cinema"" is your thing, is far superior since it's more bleak, in a realistic manner and, in a horrifying portayal, examines the mass chaos when a society is broken down (although it a well made film, it puzzles me who would get an entertainment value out of such a really sad and depressing film).If this movie did not have the charismatic Denzel Washington in it, it would not even be worth watching on cable.I would think that the only person that could enjoy this would be either an ardent aethiest or religous zealot.",1,I hated it!,1295136000,"01 16, 2011",2011,2313,"['Here', 'premise', 'post', 'apocolyptic', 'world', 'Denzel', 'Washington', 'mysterious', 'apostle/keeper', 'faith', 'who', 'roams', 'country', 'heading', 'west', 'When', 'confronted', 'practically', 'superhero', 'who', 'can', 'take', 'anybody', 'amount', 'attackers', 'carrying', 'around', 'Bible', 'supposed', 'represent', 'hope', 'lawless', 'wasteland', 'world', 'Gary', 'Oldman', 'othe', 'hand', 'power', 'hungry', 'villain', 'who', 'Bible', 'would', 'be', 'excellent', 'tool', 'suppressing', 'others', 'creating', 'fear', 'justifying', 'existing', 'turmoil', 'Denzel', 'Bible.There', 'two', 'ways', 'evaluate', 'loathsome', 'movie.1', 'pure', 'entertainment', 'terrible', 'movie', 'most', 'part', 'boring', 'combat', 'sequences', 'are', 'overstylish', 'plot', 'resolution', 'did', 'not', 'where', 'go', 'charactors', 'dialogue', 'themes', 'are', 'preposterous.2', 'taking', 'serious', 'metaphor', 'religion', 'even', 'worse', ""'m"", 'not', 'big', 'fan', 'organized', 'religion', 'can', 'be', 'argued', 'movie', 'was', 'supposed', 'be', 'proponent', 'organized', 'religion', 'seriously', 'movie', 'use', 'Bible', 'mostly', 'evil', 'terms', 'Gary', 'Oldman', 'practically', 'Marxian', 'view', 'religion', 'opium', 'masses', 'explaining', 'why', 'Bible', 'would', 'be', 'so', 'powerful', 'hands', 'Even', 'Denzel', 'Washington', 'charactor', 'who', 'supposed', 'be', 'righteous', 'intentions', 'Bible', 'really', 'not', 'act', 'much', 'hero', 'film.There', 'brutality', 'violence', 'not', 'justify', 'purpose', 'charactor', 'development', 'people', 'end', 'up', 'not', 'being', 'worthy', 'development', 'ridiculous', 'conclusion.This', 'movie', 'came', 'out', 'same', 'time', 'Road', 'overly', 'dark', 'post', 'apocolyptic', 'film', 'film', 'end', 'world', 'cinema', 'thing', 'far', 'superior', 'more', 'bleak', 'realistic', 'manner', 'horrifying', 'portayal', 'mass', 'chaos', 'when', 'society', 'broken', 'down', 'well', 'made', 'film', 'who', 'would', 'get', 'entertainment', 'value', 'such', 'really', 'sad', 'depressing', 'film', 'movie', 'did', 'not', 'have', 'charismatic', 'Denzel', 'Washington', 'would', 'not', 'even', 'be', 'worth', 'watching', 'cable.I', 'would', 'think', 'only', 'person', 'could', 'enjoy', 'would', 'be', 'ardent', 'aethiest', 'religous', 'zealot']",N/A

1311086,A3KKM0T1KY42HA,B002ZG997C,Sky,"[2, 3]","Well, after watching two equally great movies about a post-apocalyptic world one thing is for sure: life on Earth will suck after the apocalypse. Whether we ultimately nuke ourselves to oblivion or some stray asteroid does the job instead, both of the writers for The Book of Eli and The Road see a dystopian world full of cannibals and little hope. I hope that we never truly experience it, but, man, these two movies were cool!Of the two movies I think that I liked Eli a little bit more, which is reflective of my affinity for violent, graphic novel-esque movies. And indeed, The Book of Eli seemed to be exactly that...a graphic novel come to life about a rogue nomad determined to transport a special book west across a bleak and dangerous landscape. But Eli (Denzil Washington) is prepared to make the transfer...well prepared. Yes, there is unrest in the forest and Eli will keep it all equal with hatchet, ax and saw. And are higher forces at work helping to guide Eli along?Then there'sThe Road. This time the traveler is a man (Viggo Mortensen) also heading off in search of a safe haven. This man believes that the safe haven is south, and like Eli, he also has some cargo with him that he intends to protect and deliver safely at all costs...that cargo being his son. The land that Mortensen & son attempt to cross is in the same condition and full of the same dangers that I mentioned that Eli was dealing with. The Road is a lot lighter on the violence than Eli and more about a father trying to lead his son down a path of righteousness, while at the same time maintaining self-preservation as numero uno.I'd almost suggest that the two stories could be tied together and happening simultaneously in a United States devastated by catastrophe. Although, in Eli the apocalypse is explained as the result of nuclear war and bright sunlight burning the planet up due to resulting damage to the ozone layer; and I don't recall an explanation in The Road, but I think that we're supposed to gather that it was from a giant asteroid or something that created a world where a dust cloud permanently obscures the sun. Either way it's a living doomsday.Both movies feature a host of A-list actors, and even the actors that aren't as well known give A-list performances. Action. Thrills. Emotion. Get it all in two parallel worlds where you will kill or be killed for something that today you'd have discarded as trash. The Book of Eli and The Road as a double-feature for your weekend?

1311087,ASDP39VYB1AVX,B002ZG997C,SocraticMethod,"[6, 24]","For starters, this film has an excessive amount of product placement in it.  Yes, you read that right.  They use brand name objects for advertisement in a film about the apocalypse.  From Ipod to Dr. Dre Beats headphones, there's plenty of shots of how long lasting these items last in the event of human downfall.This brings me to my next point.  What causes this apocalyptic period is completely ignored and is only hinted at throughout the film.  They ignore the setting and causes yet the setting itself is trite and unoriginal.  However, they do hint at what causes this era, but this leads to by far the greatest flaw of this garbage film.The film has such an obvious religious message of Christianity and that by turning away from God and the Bible our society may fall apart in such a fashion as presented in the film.  Spoiler alert: Eli is looking for someone to deliver the Bible to preserve it and feels it can help reestablish society.  Did I need a spoiler alert for that though?  It's so obvious he's referring to the Bible.  Anyway, Eli is meant to be some righteous, god-fearing man, yet he completely contradicts the teachings of his precious Bible.  In the opening scene, he allows a woman to be gang raped because his secrecy and mission is a greater good.  There's no way in hell that Jesus would do something like this nor advocate his actions.  Jesus' ethics were not utilitarian.  Eli's actions are.  The film and the Hughes brothers think they're being subtle and coy with this religious message but it's beyond obvious and feels like they're trying to beat you over the head with their message.  Even then, it seems like they don't know their religion well enough.  They take a more Old Testament route with Eli's character, as well ignore that ethics themselves don't come from God, they misplace and overestimate the value of the Bible to society.  The film just comes off as nearly having an evangelical Christian taint I felt.Denzel's performance is one of the worst in his career as well.  He's a great actor, but maybe it was due to the Hughes brothers' direction (more likely).  It's completely one-note, dull, and plain unlikable.The final major flaw (nearly tied for the worst attribute of the film) is its ending.  They give us another horrible twist that rivals M. Night Shymalan for how bad it is.  It turns out all along Eli is blind!  Oooh!  >_>  As if the film couldn't get any worse, they made Eli blind simply to shock us into wondering how he could've done all the cool (ie crappy) action moves and how he memorized/interpreted the Bible (I think he had a copy in braile) for nothing more than a plot device that seemed only to please fans of The Village or Unbreakable.The ONE positive of this film is Gary Oldman.  The guy is a chameleon and always knows how to make a character come alive.  He makes you really hate and somehow love his character because he's brilliantly devious.  This is due in part to the Hughes brothers too as much as I hate to say it.  They made a character who knows what the Bible can do to people and how it can be used to control the masses.  This was the best thing the film had going for it.I didn't even scratch the surface though on other poor aspects like the action sequences, its Waterworld-like set and costume design (who seriously rips off Waterworld for anything??), the terrible character Milas Kunis has (who takes Eli's reigns after Eli dies at the end for no important reason other than to make simple people feel sad), and its unfitting soundtrack.Seriously, this film is horrible.",1,Terrible film on many levels,1303862400,"04 27, 2011",2011,3571,"['starters', 'film', 'excessive', 'amount', 'product', 'placement', 'Yes', 'read', 'right', 'use', 'brand', 'name', 'advertisement', 'film', 'apocalypse', 'Ipod', 'Dr.', 'Dre', 'Beats', 'headphones', 'plenty', 'shots', 'how', 'long', 'lasting', 'items', 'last', 'event', 'human', 'downfall.This', 'next', 'point', 'What', 'apocalyptic', 'period', 'completely', 'ignored', 'only', 'hinted', 'film', 'ignore', 'setting', 'yet', 'setting', 'trite', 'unoriginal', 'However', 'do', 'hint', 'what', 'era', 'far', 'greatest', 'flaw', 'garbage', 'film.The', 'film', 'obvious', 'religious', 'message', 'Christianity', 'turning', 'away', 'God', 'Bible', 'society', 'may', 'fall', 'apart', 'such', 'fashion', 'presented', 'film', 'Spoiler', 'alert', 'Eli', 'looking', 'someone', 'deliver', 'Bible', 'preserve', 'feels', 'can', 'help', 'reestablish', 'society', 'Did', 'need', 'spoiler', 'alert', 'so', 'obvious', 'referring', 'Bible', 'Anyway', 'Eli', 'meant', 'be', 'righteous', 'god-fearing', 'man', 'yet', 'completely', 'teachings', 'precious', 'Bible', 'opening', 'scene', 'woman', 'be', 'gang', 'raped', 'secrecy', 'mission', 'greater', 'good', 'way', 'hell', 'Jesus', 'would', 'do', 'something', 'advocate', 'actions', 'Jesus', 'ethics', 'were', 'not', 'utilitarian', 'Eli', 'actions', 'are', 'film', 'Hughes', 'brothers', 'think', ""'re"", 'being', 'subtle', 'coy', 'religious', 'message', 'obvious', 'feels', ""'re"", 'trying', 'beat', 'head', 'message', 'Even', 'then', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'religion', 'well', 'enough', 'take', 'more', 'Old', 'Testament', 'route', 'Eli', 'character', 'as', 'well', 'ethics', 'do', ""n't"", 'come', 'God', 'misplace', 'overestimate', 'value', 'Bible', 'society', 'film', 'just', 'off', 'nearly', 'having', 'evangelical', 'Christian', 'taint', 'felt.Denzel', 'performance', 'one', 'worst', 'career', 'well', 'great', 'actor', 'maybe', 'was', 'due', 'Hughes', 'brothers', 'direction', 'more', 'likely', 'completely', 'one-note', 'dull', 'plain', 'unlikable.The', 'final', 'major', 'flaw', 'nearly', 'tied', 'worst', 'attribute', 'film', 'ending', 'give', 'horrible', 'twist', 'M.', 'Night', 'Shymalan', 'how', 'bad', 'out', 'all', 'along', 'Eli', 'blind', 'Oooh', '>', '_', '>', 'film', 'could', ""n't"", 'get', 'worse', 'made', 'Eli', 'blind', 'simply', 'shock', 'wondering', 'how', 'could', ""'ve"", 'done', 'cool', 'ie', 'crappy', 'action', 'moves', 'how', 'memorized/interpreted', 'Bible', 'think', 'had', 'copy', 'braile', 'nothing', 'more', 'plot', 'device', 'seemed', 'only', 'please', 'fans', 'Village', 'Unbreakable.The', 'ONE', 'positive', 'film', 'Gary', 'Oldman', 'guy', 'chameleon', 'always', 'knows', 'how', 'make', 'character', 'come', 'alive', 'really', 'hate', 'somehow', 'love', 'character', 'brilliantly', 'devious', 'due', 'part', 'Hughes', 'brothers', 'too', 'as', 'much', 'hate', 'say', 'made', 'character', 'who', 'what', 'Bible', 'can', 'do', 'people', 'how', 'can', 'be', 'used', 'control', 'masses', 'was', 'best', 'thing', 'film', 'had', 'going', 'it.I', 'did', ""n't"", 'even', 'scratch', 'surface', 'other', 'poor', 'aspects', 'action', 'sequences', 'Waterworld-like', 'set', 'costume', 'design', 'who', 'seriously', 'off', 'Waterworld', 'anything', 'terrible', 'character', 'Milas', 'Kunis', 'who', 'Eli', 'reigns', 'Eli', 'end', 'important', 'reason', 'other', 'make', 'simple', 'people', 'feel', 'sad', 'unfitting', 'soundtrack.Seriously', 'film', 'horrible']",N/A
1311088,A3R8PXSFGY9MC2,B002ZG997C,Spider Monkey,"[3, 3]","`The Book Of Eli' explores one idea of what life could be like in a post nuclear war world. Here food, water, energy and books are hard to come by and every day is a struggle to survive. Eli (played by Washington) is known as a walker, who travels across the country (rather than living in a community) trying to subsist on meagre provisions and fighting off lawless robbers just to get by. He only goes into the communities (one of which that is run by the iron handed Gary Oldman) when he needs to recharge batteries or get extra water. He protects a sacred book which is highly sought after by other unscrupulous people and constantly moves west so that he can share his treasure with someone who may know how to do more good with it.This film had a bleak feel to it at first, with muted colours and lots of ash, but it soon began to feel like a cross between a Mad Max film, an action film (due to Washington's `kick ass' character who is more than capable of looking after himself against some rather unsavoury specimens) and a religious allegory about mans folly's and humanity. This was reminiscent of `The Road' which I saw recently and which is based along similar themes, but I found this films story to be more engaging and more uplifting at the end and much prefer it over the aforementioned film. The acting is pretty decent from all involved and Oldman plays his sneering bad guy role perfectly yet again. There is a good twist in the tale and some issues are raised about mans behaviour without moralising or preaching. Some people seem to dislike this film due to it's religious overtones, but to be honest these are pretty slight and are relevant to the story. All in all this was an enjoyable film and if `The Road' put you off post apocalyptic films, but the premise still intrigues you, then this is well worth a viewing.Feel free to check out my blog which can be found on my profile page.",4,The Book of Eli,1294617600,"01 10, 2011",2011,1910,"['Book', 'Eli', 'one', 'idea', 'what', 'life', 'could', 'be', 'post', 'nuclear', 'war', 'world', 'Here', 'food', 'water', 'energy', 'books', 'are', 'hard', 'come', 'day', 'struggle', 'survive', 'Eli', 'played', 'Washington', 'known', 'walker', 'who', 'country', 'rather', 'living', 'community', 'trying', 'subsist', 'meagre', 'provisions', 'fighting', 'off', 'lawless', 'robbers', 'just', 'get', 'only', 'communities', 'one', 'run', 'iron', 'handed', 'Gary', 'Oldman', 'when', 'recharge', 'batteries', 'get', 'extra', 'water', 'sacred', 'book', 'highly', 'sought', 'other', 'unscrupulous', 'people', 'constantly', 'west', 'so', 'can', 'share', 'treasure', 'someone', 'who', 'may', 'know', 'how', 'do', 'more', 'good', 'it.This', 'film', 'had', 'bleak', 'feel', 'first', 'muted', 'colours', 'lots', 'ash', 'soon', 'began', 'feel', 'cross', 'Mad', 'Max', 'film', 'action', 'film', 'due', 'Washington', 'kick', 'ass', 'character', 'who', 'more', 'capable', 'looking', 'rather', 'unsavoury', 'specimens', 'religious', 'allegory', 'mans', 'folly', 'humanity', 'was', 'reminiscent', 'Road', 'saw', 'recently', 'based', 'similar', 'themes', 'found', 'films', 'story', 'be', 'more', 'engaging', 'more', 'uplifting', 'end', 'much', 'prefer', 'aforementioned', 'film', 'acting', 'pretty', 'decent', 'involved', 'Oldman', 'sneering', 'bad', 'guy', 'role', 'perfectly', 'yet', 'again', 'good', 'twist', 'tale', 'issues', 'are', 'raised', 'mans', 'behaviour', 'moralising', 'preaching', 'people', 'seem', 'dislike', 'film', 'due', 'religious', 'overtones', 'be', 'honest', 'are', 'pretty', 'slight', 'are', 'relevant', 'story', 'was', 'enjoyable', 'film', 'Road', 'put', 'off', 'post', 'apocalyptic', 'films', 'premise', 'still', 'then', 'well', 'viewing.Feel', 'free', 'check', 'out', 'blog', 'can', 'be', 'found', 'profile', 'page']",N/A

Apparently, the makers of this film were under the misguided impression that a braille version would be the same exact size as a smallish font print version when the reality is that the braille version has about 18 volumes and weighs about 70 pounds.  In the end of the movie, he transcribes it to a group that had a printing press, and it is clear that it was a complete Bible.  Oops.Still perhaps the book of Eli is an abridged version without all the unnecessary filler.  He was being guided by God, so maybe all the parts that had been misinterpreted had been removed from the good book of Eli.  Keep the 10 commandments and all the stuff about loving your neighbor and turning the other cheek, but maybe get rid of some of the animal sacrifice stuff.

1311099,A3BMRSE8N1858V,B002ZG997C,Terence Allen,"[0, 1]","The Hughes Brothers film, ""The Book of Eli"" is a well-acted, well-crafted, surprising story of faith, love, and hope, even in the midst of chaos and destruction.The film takes place 30 years after a nuclear apocalypse. A lone traveller named Eli, played by Denzel Washington makes his way toward the Western United States. In his possession is a King James Bible, thought to be the last one in existence. Books of faith like the Bible have been held responsible for the worlds destruction, and therefore most have been destroyed. Eli feels that he is being lead Westward and the book will be safe at journey's end.As he travels, he encounters the familiar kind of desperation that we have come to expect from watching the Mad Max films and similar post-nuclear movies. Roving bands of thieves stealing, raping, and killing. Things like water and fuel becoming rare and prized possessions, and a general bleakness that threatens anyone and everyone. Through this landscape, Eli travels, until he comes to a town run by Gary Oldman and his maurauding gangs. Oldman's gangs are in search of a particular book that Oldman thinks will leverage his power over the townspeople. The book? The Bible. He soon discovers that Eli has one in his possession. One that only Eli opens and reads. The tale continues as Oldman's gang pursues Eli in order to get the Bible. Eli has been saddled with a sidekick, played by Mila Kunis, the daughter of Oldman's blind girlfriend, who is played by Jennifer Beals.This film has lots of familiar elements, indeed, but also rises above what could seem to barren ground on the strength of the great performances - Washington, Oldman, Kunis, Beals, etc, and a surprise or two at the end that causes one to revisit lots of what they saw in the last hour plus.

1311103,A3M2WW0PO34B94,B002ZG997C,thornhillatthemovies.com,"[4, 12]","The Hughes Brothers, Allen and Albert, are not exactly the most prolific writing and directing team working in film. Their last film, ""From Hell"", is a criminally underrated and poorly timed release starring Johnny Depp and Heather Graham in an adaptation of a graphic novel about Jack the Ripper. It was released a few weeks after the 9/11 attacks and was all but ignored. Their new film, ""The Book of Eli"" is also based on a graphic novel. Despite a few interesting moments and a couple of good performances, the film is nowhere near as successful as their last effort. Given their track record, we have another seven or eight years to see if they hit the mark again.Eli (Denzel Washington) travels alone across a desolate landscape. As he rummages through abandoned and dilapidated homes and walks past the husks of rusted out cars, we quickly get the sense something bad has happened, something big that caused their way of life to change. As Eli makes his way west, we see he has two prized possessions. The first is an old IPOD he has jerry-rigged to a battery, to listen to music, to give himself an escape from the desolation around him. The second is a large leather bound book with a lock and a cross on the cover, a bible which he reads on a nightly basis. One day, he approaches a crumbling freeway interchange and watches as a group of motorcycle bandits quickly overtakes a man and a woman traveling together. They kill the man, take their possessions and begin to rape the woman. Eli watches, trying to decide if he should reach out, if he should get involved and help the woman. He decides to move on. Later, he comes to a town populated by a group of survivors and led by Carnegie (Gary Oldman). Carnegie lords over his people by controlling the food and water. He also provides alcohol drugs and women to the populous, operating out of a makeshift brothel carved out of an abandoned theater. Carnegie sends his teams out to scour the countryside looking for a book. When Eli arrives, he realizes the bike gang is in the bar and quickly takes them out with his sword and some fancy footwork. News travels to Carnegie and he wants to meet the new arrival. Carnegie wants Eli to work for him, to help him rebuild society. They are both survivors and know what life was like before the war thirty summers ago and they can both read. But Eli declines. Soon, Carnegie learns of Eli's bible, the very book he had been searching for. He sends Solara (Mila Kunis), the daughter of his companion (Jennifer Beals), a blind woman whom he adores, to visit Eli and spend the night with him. But Solara soon realizes Eli is different and might be able to help her escape. They reluctantly team up and continue west. But Carnegie isn't going to give up that quickly.When a film takes place in a different time or reality than our own, it has to work very hard to establish this landscape and to make us believe in everything that is happening. The filmmakers are extremely successful in one regard and less so in another. The landscape Eli travels is bleak, gray and desolate. As he walks through the gray, dressed in an old army jacket and a pair of wrap around sunglasses, nothing he passes looks like it was built recently and this fits extremely well with the back story we learn during the course of the film. A nuclear war happened thirty years ago and the survivors have been struggling to live ever since. People like Carnegie have power because he is able to control things like water and food. Most of the people surrounding people like Carnegie and Eli are younger and many have been born after the war. This means most are unable to read. Because of this, Carnegie realizes the power a bible might have and seeks to find a copy.When Eli first spots the lone couple pushing a shopping basket with all of their belongings, he stops and watches them. The bike gang quickly overtakes them, kills the man and rapes the woman. But Eli just watches from his perch high above, tentatively reaching for his machete. He decides not to interact. Yet, later, he cautiously approaches a woman sitting on the ground next to her overturned shopping cart, apparently unable to move. Why is he reluctantly willing to help one and not the other? Later, Eli talks vaguely about his journey and it seems like he is on a quest. But how can we believe in his quest when he reluctantly agrees to help some, but not others. As we begin to learn more about the extent and meaning of Eli's journey, this double standard becomes even more troubling and problematic to the narrative.Denzel Washington is always good and as Eli he brings the right amount of seriousness and conviction to the role. We get he has a serious goal for his journey and he won't let anything stand in his way. When  he realizes the danger Carnegie presents, he simply walks away, trying to avoid further conflict. Of course, Carnegie can't let it end. When he has to help Solara, he does so reluctantly because it will impede his journey. But we get the sense that some part of his journey might be leading him to provide her with a hand.Washington is an extremely charismatic actor and he is just about always good, even when he appears in films that don't match his skill. Unfortunately, as one of the top stars in Hollywood, he continues to appear in films that don't match his skill. So for every film that reminds us why he is a star with great skill (""Crimson Tide"", ""American Gangster"", ""Devil in a Blue Dress""), he appears in an almost equal number of films that give us reason to question his skill (""D&eacute;j&agrave; Vu"", ""The Siege""). Washington clearly likes to work with the same people (he has appeared in a number of Tony Scott films (""Crimson Tide"", ""Man on Fire"") but I have to wonder why he appears in so many films that don't live up to his ability. Is it the money? Is he anxious to make more films? If so, why doesn't he use his start power to make these problematic films better?Gary Oldman is good as Carnegie, the man who realizes the people, the few survivors, need to believe in something. He also realizes that if he possesses this, he will become more powerful and more legendary. He rules his kingdom with a quiet intensity. It is interesting to watch him interact with Claudia (Jennifer Beals), his blind lover. When the motorcycle gang brings back some shampoo, he eagerly uses it to wash Claudia's hair, thrilled to provide her with the luxury. But when he sees an obstacle in his way, he has no qualms about ordering his men to remove the barrier.Mila Kunis is less interesting as Solara. Carnegie initially orders her to spend the night with Eli and she is clearly not used to fulfilling such requests. But when she realizes Eli is not interested, she pleads with him to simply let her stay the night. If she is sent away, Carnegie won't like it and she will have trouble. Later, when they begin the quest, Kunis seems to be simply moving her character through the emotions. She is unable to really make us believe she shares the same intensity as Eli.Ray Stevenson (HBO's ""Rome"", ""The Punisher: War Zone"") plays Carnegie's security. Stevenson is always interesting to watch, he has a certain intensity about him which causes us to watch him, even when he is saying mundane things or unable to contribute to the narrative.There are a couple of interesting action scenes. Early on, Eli is confronted by a motley band of survivors who are looking to score something to eat (cannibalism seems to be common in this time). He gives them a chance, informing them if they continue they won't survive. They laugh and confront him. Eli moves under an old overpass and the entire fight happens in darkness, we are only able to see their silhouettes. He quickly dispatches the group, beheading more than a few of the attackers. In fact, this one scene has more beheadings than I have ever seen in a single film before. The scene is interesting visually and there are a couple of moments like this. But the rest of the film concerns Eli's slow journey across a barren landscape. It feels a bit like someone touched a fast forward button (for the fight scenes) a few times while watching a DVD of the rest of the film.There is a final ""ah huh"" moment. And it is interesting, but it unfortunately raises more questions and starts to make the viewer look more closely at the rest of the narrative, trying to spot any other problems, holes and poorly constructed bits. When this happens, the film has to be air tight, to withstand such scrutiny.And ""The Book of Eli"" isn't.",2,"This ""Book"" Is A Very Slow Read",1264982400,"02 1, 2010",2010,8555,"['Hughes',

1311109,A2UNMXBJSVIXFB,B002ZG997C,Tony Khamvongsouk,"[3, 6]","Movie - 4.5I've never been much of a religious person. And when I first saw the trailer for this movie, I thought to myself, ""well, Denzel can be pretty bad ass, but this whole Christian vibe has me a bit iffy. I hope it doesn't end up feeling pretentious or anything."" Thankfully, the Hughes Brothers and company managed to surprise me. After finally getting to see the film in theaters, I liked it a lot. The story takes place in a post-Apocalyptic future where Earth has been scorched by war into a barren wasteland and humanity has degraded itself into packs of scavengers and nomads who kill, and even eat, each other just to survive. Enter Eli (Denzel Washington), a man on a mission traveling west to deliver what is apparently the very last copy of the King James Holy Bible. On his journey he comes across a man named Carnegie (Gary Oldman) who is looking for the very same book. But sensing the ill intentions in Carnegie's plan to use it, Eli refuses to give up the book and must fight his way through with the help of a young girl, Solara (Mila Kunis). Thematically speaking, the movie itself isn't so much about Christianity (like I was afraid it would be), but the power of faith and the implied applicability of religion. Being an atheist, I always found it irksome that religion was so misinterpreted and taken out of context and that people were so vehement about it that I decided to stop believing in it altogether. In The Book of Eli, however, I find it refreshing that they can offer such a bold perspective on what it really means to follow in what you believe. Religion was never about which god is the right one or where it all originally started. It was simply about learning, finding something to believe in, possibly teaching and passing it down, and proceeding to pursue those beliefs with your own conviction. Mix bits and pieces of that with some stunning action sequences and a great cast of opposing actors and you've got a pretty good film. By the way, don't let the premise and symbolic inclination fool you. While I, personally, found the quasi-theological undertones enlightening, it's still choreographed by Jeff Imada (most famous for the Bourne films), so take from that what you will. Sci-fi actioners with a message -- gotta' love 'em.Video - 5.0I remember seeing this in theaters and thinking that the film quality had a peculiar darkness to it. I was hoping the photography would present itself a little better on BD, and I was right. The movie is very desaturated (as briefly touched upon in the extras) and doesn't have much vibrancy at all until the end of the film. Something like 50-70% of the color scheme was intentionally made to almost monochromatic or like a black and white picture. But in exchange for that drabness, black levels and contrast have an amazing amount of depth and clarity. A lot of the backgrounds were digitally shot or painted and incorporated into the filming and it really, really shows in this transfer. You can see all sorts of fine detail from the little grains of sand in the ground or blowing through the air, the individual follicles and oil reflections from Eli's beard, the dirt and grime on peoples' faces, skin wrinkles and imperfections, notches and kinks in metallic structures, you name it. Backgrounds look especially bleak and reflect the mood of the production design well with ominous cloud cover and very low lighting. Getting back to the black levels, these are among the best I've seen on BD to date. In the scene where Eli fights off the thugs in the underpass you can see his silhouette perfectly, but even better, still make out individual shapes and textures in his clothes and backpack despite the darkness of the tunnel. And best of all, there's very little noise in any of the dark or low-lit scenes. I've never seen anything so immaculately black. Furthermore, black levels make for some great scenic shots that help to compliment the brooding nature of the film itself. One of my favorite shots in the movie (from an aesthetic viewpoint anyway) is when Eli is walking on the destroyed overpass with the camera looking at him from below. Something about the angle of the shot and obvious aftermath of what the wars did to the world is frightening to think about, but at the same time very cool sci-fi stuff. There's very little to complain about in this video transfer, if anything at all, outside of your own personal preference for coloring. What a great effort by WB on this one.Audio - 5.0The Book of Eli is an a word - aggressive. From the opening forest sequence we get a steady dose of ambient bass as the camera pans across displaying the state of the world and result of our own destruction via the war that ended civilization. The wind howls eerily along the front sound stage right before Eli shoots his arrow into his soon-to-be dinner as a somewhat jarring thump emanates from the bow. We're then introduced to some of the film's score with an ethereal-sounding piece composed by Atticus Ross during the flash of the movie's title. Afterward, Eli comes upon an abandoned house looking to seek shelter as he kicks the door in and produces an even more jarring LFE. As he searches the house, all the little creaks and cringes of the old wood spread and separate amongst the front and rears. When he settles down for the night, his mp3 player gives us a little of Al Green's ""How Can You Mend A Broken Heart,"" a soothing piece of soul that's definitely a contrast to the world Eli lives in, but makes for a good listen once we get to hear a part of it in full lossless surround. But if you want action, the underpass fight is where things start to make themselves heard. Reverberation is stunning when Eli steps back into the shadows and takes out each of those thugs with his ""samurai machete."" Limbs get sliced and bodies impaled with bloody cold execution, while the chainsaw guy, despite his loud and powerful hardware, basically acts as a test dummy for a rather large blade. But the real highlight of this precision soundtrack is in the town shootout. Guns are fired from a multitude of heights and angles with absolutely zero music resulting in a very impressive display of directionality and dynamics as bullets fly from the right front to left rear, right rear to left front, and any number of combinations therein. Shots echo with deadly accuracy and is probably one of the best shootouts I've heard in a while. The action then comes to a close during another big shootout at the old couple's house. Here we get to hear a good amount of automatic weapons fire, a bomb, a bazooka, and a Gatling gun. It's a pretty awesome sound design.Extras - 4.0We start off with Maximum Movie Mode as the movie plays itself like normal with bits and pieces of behind-the-scenes footage dispersed throughout and little Focus Points icons at certain parts. You push enter on your controller there and it takes you to a separate screen that breaks down whatever aspect they're attempting to explain (usually in 3-4 minute segments). It's a big mix of production design, writing, filming, and commentary about what the cast and crew wanted to achieve in terms of literary themes, symbolism, and entertainment. I actually played the movie at 1.5x speed to make things a little faster but still slow enough to where I could re-watch the film itself while somewhat conserving time. And while the Focus Points can be accessed as a standalone feature (34 minutes worth, total), I still stand by the opinion that watching these during the movie itself adds a good deal of real-time context and perspective to the on-screen action, which is a very cool variation of the Picture-in-Picture track. Next is a 5-minute motion comic (""A Lost Tale: Billy"") that gives a little bit of background information on Carnegie's childhood. It's short, but a good revelation and indicator as to the motivations we see in his current state during the movie. After that is a 13-minute feature (""Starting Over"") talking about some the story's themes, comparing that world to ours, and discussing the symbolism in what it means to truly start over from scratch. ""Eli's Journey"" (about 18-minutes) analyzes the character of Eli himself the production of the film, the casting of Denzel, various collaborations and writing points, and the character's motivations. Both of these features are diced and served in parts throughout Maximum Movie Mode, but feel much more in-depth when watched as complete segments. And then finally is ""'The Book of Eli' Soundtrack,"" which shows a sit-down interview with composer Atticus Ross and co-director Allen Hughes. I was expecting this to delve more into theme composition or instrumentation, but it turned out to be just a session of praise from Hughes and a little bit of confirmation by Ross. Altogether, it amounts just over an hour of extras.Overall - 4.5The Book of Eli is a movie that interests me a lot. I was never big on religion, but I like how this film in particular highlighted the context of religion, or faith in general, as a personal driving force rather than as a branch of organized control (which it seems more approximated to be nowadays). It's difficult to explain, though I can say it's certainly given me something of a new perspective on things. Denzel Washington never ceases to amaze me, and it was a delight to see him opposite Gary Oldman. With a philosophical approach to society and civilization, but just the right balance of action, it made for a very entertaining movie. Add to that reference A/V quality and a healthy dose of extras, and The Book of Eli comes highly recommended.",5,The Book of Eli (Blu-ray),1291248000,"12 2, 2010",2010,9628,"['Movie', '4.5I', ""'ve"",

The lack of three others stars is to signify how much I dislike the plot and its execution.First, I should say that the movie seems to lend itself to a variety of interpretations, much like the Bible itself.  I don't know if this is intentional, but it's an odd feeling to watch a movie where the central idea seems to morph back and forth as the movie progresses.  I suppose it could be a mark of the writer's brilliance to juggle contradictory ideas so well, but personally I found it distracting and unpleasant. There were several ideas at play, and here are the ones most obvious:- The United States was devestated by a religion-fueld catastrophe of some sort; therefore, religion is dangerous.- Now that religious books are almost nonexistent, along with their attendant moralities, the United States is lawless and ammoral. There is no source of morality outside of these books.- Religious books are only dangerous in the wrong hands; otherwise, they are filled with the spiritual necessities of healthy societies.- People who would pervert the power of religious books are blind to the truths inside of them.- Only men of strong faith are able to rise above their baser desires, possess true courage, and have a deeper meaning to their life beyond mere existence.- Men of strong faith who listen to their voices are beyond reproach; they have no burden of evidence and their path is true for them because it reflects their inner guidance.- The defense of religion can sometimes supercede its perceived tenants of love and compassion.- The rebuilding of a civilized society can only begin with the widespread availability of the Bible.I could probably think of a few other themes, but while watching The Book of Eli I had a hard time figuring out the main theme, but by the end of the movie, it seems clear to me that the movie was primarily promoting The Bible as the lone source of morality in the world, and that strong faith is necessary to sustain a person's happiness, virtue, and purpose.  Gardy Oldman's character, the one who sought to use the Bible as a weapon and a controller over the masses, is portrayed as completely villainous and obsessive.  It seems to indicate that people like him are not pruduced by some of the Bible's more unsavory messages (slavery is permissable, women are to be subservient to men, etc.), but arise indpendently and in spite of the Bible's preferred messages, such as the Hollywood-friendly variety that deal with love and peace.The most troublesome aspect of the movie is that it idicates that the Bible's real meaning has nothing to do with all the wars and terrors that it has seemingly inspired in so many individuals and groups. It pretends that the Bible is a tome of love and peace, yet it ignores-- once again-- its condonement of slavery, its inferior treatment of women, its suggestions of severe child punishment, its Old Testament genocides commanded by God himself, its vacuous collection of commandments (not just the main ten) that mostly have nothing to do with real morality, and so on.I could continue to ramble on for some length, but I will just summarize briefly my sentiments about the movie.  It is basically a boring, well-produced movie with brief spurts of bloody violence, whose message would most appeal to fundamentalist Christians who fancy their own R-rated Tim LeHaye-type story to prove to secular friends that they're not entirely ""uncool"", and that a Biblical world view is regaining significance even in the largely secular and liberal atmosphere of Hollywood.And to top it off, after all this pandering to the fundamentalist, at the end of the movie there is a shot of The Bible being set right beside the Quran on a book shelf.  I wonder how many Christians who tote this movie as their new cinematic honor badge have noticed that neat little extreme liberal stroke right at the end.p.s. since multiple interpretations of this movie are inevitable, I understand that some may not agree with my view of the movie's meaning.  But, as I said, I personally sensed most strongly the message dealt with above.",2,A well-made movie with a repugnant message.,1310342400,"07 11, 2011",2011,4166,"['two', 'stars', 'are', 'strictly', 'good', 'production', 'acting', 'film', 'lack', 'three', 'others', 'stars', 'signify', 'how', 'much', 'dislike', 'plot', 'execution.First', 'should', 'say', 'movie', 'lend', 'variety', 'interpretations', 'much', 'Bible', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'intentional', 'odd', 'feeling', 'watch', 'movie', 'where', 'central', 'idea', 'morph', 'back', 'forth', 'movie', 'suppose', 'could', 'be', 'mark', 'writer', 'brilliance', 'juggle', 'contradictory', 'ideas', 'so', 'well', 'personally', 'found', 'distracting', 'unpleasant', 'were', 'several', 'ideas', 'play', 'here', 'are', 'ones', 'most', 'obvious', 'United', 'States', 'was', 'devestated', 'religion-fueld', 'catastrophe', 'sort', 'therefore', 'religion', 'dangerous.-', 'Now', 'religious', 'books', 'are', 'almost', 'nonexistent', 'attendant', 'moralities', 'United', 'States', 'lawless', 'ammoral', 'source', 'morality', 'books.-', 'Religious', 'books', 'are', 'only', 'dangerous', 'wrong', 'hands', 'otherwise', 'are', 'filled', 'spiritual', 'necessities', 'healthy', 'societies.-', 'People', 'who', 'would', 'pervert', 'power', 'religious', 'books', 'are', 'truths', 'them.-', 'Only', 'men', 'strong', 'faith', 'are', 'able', 'rise', 'baser', 'desires', 'possess', 'true', 'courage', 'have', 'deeper', 'meaning', 'life', 'mere', 'existence.-', 'Men', 'strong', 'faith', 'who', 'listen', 'voices', 'are', 'reproach', 'have', 'burden', 'evidence', 'path', 'true', 'inner', 'guidance.-', 'defense', 'religion', 'can', 'sometimes', 'supercede', 'perceived', 'tenants', 'love', 'compassion.-', 'rebuilding', 'civilized', 'society', 'can', 'only', 'begin', 'widespread', 'availability', 'Bible.I', 'could', 'probably', 'think', 'few', 'other', 'themes', 'watching', 'Book', 'Eli', 'had', 'hard', 'time', 'figuring', 'out', 'main', 'theme', 'end', 'movie', 'clear', 'movie', 'was', 'primarily', 'promoting', 'Bible', 'lone', 'source', 'morality', 'world', 'strong', 'faith', 'necessary', 'sustain', 'person', 'happiness', 'virtue', 'purpose', 'Gardy', 'Oldman', 'character', 'one', 'who', 'sought', 'use', 'Bible', 'weapon', 'controller', 'masses', 'portrayed', 'completely', 'villainous', 'obsessive', 'indicate', 'people', 'are', 'not', 'pruduced', 'Bible', 'more', 'unsavory', 'messages', 'slavery', 'permissable', 'women', 'are', 'be', 'subservient', 'men', 'etc', 'arise', 'indpendently', 'spite', 'Bible', 'preferred', 'messages', 'such', 'Hollywood-friendly', 'variety', 'deal', 'love', 'peace.The', 'most', 'troublesome', 'aspect', 'movie', 'Bible', 'real', 'meaning', 'nothing', 'do', 'wars', 'terrors', 'seemingly', 'inspired', 'so', 'many', 'individuals', 'groups', 'Bible', 'tome', 'love', 'peace', 'once', 'again', 'condonement', 'slavery', 'inferior', 'treatment', 'women', 'suggestions', 'severe', 'child', 'punishment', 'Old', 'Testament', 'genocides', 'commanded', 'God', 'vacuous', 'collection', 'commandments', 'not', 'just', 'main', 'ten', 'mostly', 'have', 'nothing', 'do', 'real', 'morality', 'so', 'on.I', 'could', 'continue', 'ramble', 'length', 'will', 'just', 'summarize', 'briefly', 'sentiments', 'movie', 'basically', 'boring', 'well-produced', 'movie', 'brief', 'spurts', 'bloody', 'violence', 'message', 'would', 'most', 'appeal', 'fundamentalist', 'Christians', 'who', 'fancy', 'own', 'R-rated', 'Tim', 'LeHaye-type', 'story', 'prove', 'secular', 'friends', ""'re"", 'not', 'entirely', 'uncool', 'Biblical', 'world', 'view', 'regaining', 'significance', 'even', 'largely', 'secular', 'liberal', 'atmosphere', 'Hollywood.And', 'top', 'off', 'pandering', 'fundamentalist', 'end', 'movie', 'shot', 'Bible', 'being', 'set', 'right', 'Quran', 'book', 'shelf', 'wonder', 'how', 'many', 'Christians', 'who', 'tote', 'movie', 'new', 'cinematic', 'honor', 'badge', 'have', 'noticed', 'neat', 'little', 'extreme', 'liberal', 'stroke', 'right', 'end.p.s', 'multiple', 'interpretations', 'movie', 'are', 'inevitable', 'understand', 'may', 'not', 'agree', 'view', 'movie', 'meaning', 'said', 'personally', 'sensed', 'most', 'strongly', 'message', 'dealt', 'above']",N/A

Some viewers may think the film's premise is similar to that of the 2009 film ""The Road,"" but unlike the Cormac McCarthy adaptation and its grim realism, action-packed ""The Book of Eli"" aims more for entertainment, but not in the same way as the ""Mad Max"" series did years ago. And the film's story itself requires considerable suspension of disbelief, its ending in particular.Set in the bleak world of post-apocalyptic USA, ""The Book of Eli"" follows the tale of a lone man (Denzel Washington) travelling across the country, carrying a certain book. Not much is known about him - except he has been wandering for 30 years and that to protect the book, he is ready to fight and kill. And he is very good at that.The man arrives at a town dominated by a local mobster Carnegie (Gary Oldman). Carnegie has a monopoly on the town's water that is still uncontaminated after the global disaster. He is looking for a book to consolidate his status as ruler of the community, and he is going to have it no matter what it takes.""The Book of Eli"" is directed by Albert Hughes and Allen Hughes, known for ""From Hell,"" adaptation of the graphic novel by Alan Moore and Eddie Campbell. Their inspiration comes from many sources - Segio Leone, for instance. Eli's fighting style looks more like a swordsman's. It is fast and deadly.With the cast including Ray Stevenson, Tom Waits, Jennifer Beals and Michael Gambon and its impressive visual sense, ""The Book of Eli"" succeeds in what it sets out to do, Post-Apocalyptic Western action.",4,(3.5 STARS) Once Upon a Time in Post-Apocalyptic America,1284854400,"09 19, 2010",2010,1703,"['film', 'based', 'original', 'script', 'first-time', 'writer', 'Gary', 'Whitta', 'mood', 'atmosphere', 'Book', 'Eli', 'more', 'Western', 'graphic', 'novel', 'viewers', 'may', 'think', 'film', 'premise', 'similar', '2009', 'film', 'Road', 'Cormac', 'McCarthy', 'adaptation', 'grim', 'realism', 'action-packed', 'Book', 'Eli', 'more', 'entertainment', 'not', 'same', 'way', 'Mad', 'Max', 'series', 'did', 'years', 'ago', 'film', 'story', 'considerable', 'suspension', 'disbelief', 'ending', 'particular.Set', 'bleak', 'world', 'post-apocalyptic', 'USA', 'Book', 'Eli', 'tale', 'lone', 'man', 'Denzel', 'Washington', 'travelling', 'country', 'carrying', 'certain', 'book', 'Not', 'much', 'known', 'been', 'wandering', '30', 'years', 'protect', 'book', 'ready', 'fight', 'kill', 'very', 'good', 'that.The', 'man', 'town', 'dominated', 'local', 'mobster', 'Carnegie', 'Gary', 'Oldman', 'Carnegie', 'monopoly', 'town', 'water', 'still', 'uncontaminated', 'global', 'disaster', 'looking', 'book', 'consolidate', 'status', 'ruler', 'community', 'going', 'have', 'matter', 'what', 'Book', 'Eli', 'directed', 'Albert', 'Hughes', 'Allen', 'Hughes', 'known', 'From', 'Hell', 'adaptation', 'graphic', 'novel', 'Alan', 'Moore', 'Eddie', 'Campbell', 'inspiration', 'many', 'sources', 'Segio', 'Leone', 'instance', 'Eli', 'fighting', 'style', 'more', 'swordsman', 'fast', 'cast', 'including', 'Ray', 'Stevenson', 'Tom', 'Waits', 'Jennifer', 'Beals', 'Michael', 'Gambon', 'impressive', 'visual', 'sense', 'Book', 'Eli', 'what', 'out', 'do', 'Post-Apocalyptic', 'Western', 'action']",N/A
1311117,A18GP1PWVTKXQQ,B002ZG997C,Turfseer,"[1, 3]","*** This review may contain spoilers ***For those who were unable to suspend their disbelief (or more importantly, their common sense) regarding the many implausible moments in 'The Book of Eli', let me say unequivocally that I am with you! However, let me explain why I gave this film a '3' out of '5' (or 5 out of 10 on Imdb) despite finding the whole thing quite hokey. First of all, there are many films that are far worse than this one; secondly, I thought that the cgi effects and set design were actually quite good, especially the way in which the filmmakers created their 'equivalent' wild west post-apocalyptic town; and finally, the film actually has engendered a great deal of internet postings defending the many absurd, implausible ideas and scenes utilizing all kinds of tortured reasoning, which I found quite enjoyable to read!The Hughes Brothers have come a long way since their urban crime drama, Menace II Society. They have proved they can proffer up a post-apocalyptic shoot-em-up as good as any mainstream director. Taking a cue from M. Night Shyamalyn's 'Sixth Sense', not only do they know how to dispatch (i.e. 'off') the bad guys in a multitude of creative ways (hands chopped off, cross-bow shootings, one gunshot take downs, etc.), they also can throw in all kinds of clues, pointing to the fact (SPOILERS AHEAD--DON'T READ IF YOU WANT THE TWIST ENDING SPOILED FOR YOU) that Denzel Washington (Eli) has been blind all along. How exactly is Eli able to kill all those biker dudes (first with a knife and later with a gun) without being able to see them? The answer, of course, is in the 'book' itself. Wouldn't you know it, but the Book of Eli begins with a 'B'; yep, shock of all shocks, it's THE BIBLE!!! Channeling 'Ben Hur', the Hughes Brothers make the argument that miracles can be found even in a post-apocalyptic world! Like the Apostle Paul, Eli's 'faith' allows him to miraculously survive multiple onslaughts, including a bullet direct to the gut by bad guy Carnegie.The warmed-over Christian shibboleth that miracles occur due to 'belief in faith alone' is just another canard where we must suspend our disbelief in order to enjoy this film. But there's one small problem. Eli has been carrying one copy of the Bible that he's been trying to memorize for years, and it's in Braille!!! Since the Bible in Braille would consist of many heavy volumes, this is one plot point which even some of the most fanatical defenders of the film, have trouble explaining away.There are other moments in 'Eli' which I still had a lot of trouble explaining away myself. What about Eli walking around for days after having stocked up with only a canteen of water? All the copies of the Christian Bible have been burned but copies of the Jewish Bible and Koran end up on the library shelf at Alcatraz? And how exactly did he escape from the room when Carnegie and his thugs lock him up? I guess Eli finds a 'way' because all those who believe in God, manage to do so.Perhaps one of the most weakest ideas in 'Eli' is Carnegie's belief that obtaining the Bible will enable him to extend his power. Since he and Eli are only a few of the people who actually have heard of The Bible, why does he assume that introducing it to the post-apocalyptic survivors will enable him to bring them under his fold? Since the majority of people in the new world have little or no knowledge of prior literature, Carnegie could have wrote his own book which he could have used to sway the masses. Of course, somehow the Bible is supposed to have some kind of a mystical, intrinsic power (perhaps rays emanating from the book itself) which leads Carnegie to believe he can use it as a brainwashing tool. Since it's never demonstrated how Carnegie could become more powerful by getting hold of The Bible, the stakes are never high enough for us to care whether Carnegie gets the book or not. Now if Eli knew the location of a nuclear bomb, that's a Macguffin that I could believe Carnegie would want to get his hands on!There seems little doubt that the most completely miscast actor in 'The Book of Eli' is Mila Kunis. She seems so out of place in this film that her performance actually drags the film down a notch or two. USA Today film critic Claudia Puig couldn't have said it better about Kunis in her film review: ""Vacuous and far too glam, she looks as if she dropped in from a Ray-Ban commercial."" Didn't anyone find it a bit ridiculous how Solara (Kunis) suddenly acquires Eli's amazing martial arts-like skills and takes down most of Carnegie's henchmen in one of the final scenes? Denzel also has become painfully one-note in many of his recent film roles as a middle-aged actor.Finally, I'd like to chime in on the controversy as to whether Eli has converted to Islam when he arrives on 'Alcatraz Island'. A Muslim is not allowed to read any religious book except the Koran, so when Eli dresses up in a white robe as he translates the Bible, I think the Hughes Brothers were suggesting that all along he was some kind of post-apocalyptic Essene. Just my interpretation!I would like to thank all the faith-based defenders of 'The Book of Eli' along with all those who employ tortured reasoning to explain all the ridiculous goings-on in this film. Without you, I would never have enjoyed this film as much as I did and given it a passable rating.",3,Attention all Atheists and disbelievers: 'The Book of Eli' begins with the letter

I'll give movies of this type some slack I wouldn't always give other kinds, so that even a relatively weak post-apoc flick like Doomsday (in which Malcolm McDowell appeared, as he does here) still has its interesting moments. But if it's a good one such as I Am Legend, I'm really into it bigtime.  So I've been eagerly anticipating The Book of Eli from the time the first trailers appeared, and now that I've seen it there were many things about it I liked.  Start with the mythic prophet main character.  His super-heroic weapons skills showed there was something unique about him early on.  Those scenes were generally pretty cool, and they were spread out pretty well over the length of the film.  (Any more fight scenes would have bored me.)  Eli's story plays out with a kind of grim determinism, although it also has hopeful elements as well.  I was glad I wasn't previously familiar with the story, as the major revelations about the Book in the final act were a complete surprise.  Mr. Washington was an excellent choice for the lead.  Other roles were well cast too, including (to my surprise) Jennifer Beals as the blind mistress of Gary Oldman's bad boss character.  Oldman himself struck just the right notes of ego, madness & desperation.  Anyway, as far as the post-apoc nature of the movie, it provides fascinating glimpses of which possessions would be really valuable in such a world (ex., chapstick yes; cigarette lighter, not so much), and other aspects of survival felt very authentic throughout the film.  All in all, it wasn't quite the adventure I was expecting (with occasional pacing issues), but I still found it to be an enjoyable viewing experience.",4,A good post-apocalyptic tale,1263513600,"01 15, 2010",2010,1767,"['post-apocalypse', 'sub-genre', 'science', 'fiction', 'always', 'been', 'place', 'like', 'go', ""'ll"", 'give', 'movies', 'type', 'slack', 'would', ""n't"", 'always', 'give', 'other', 'kinds', 'even', 'relatively', 'weak', 'post-apoc', 'flick', 'Doomsday', 'Malcolm', 'McDowell', 'appeared', 'here', 'still', 'interesting', 'moments', 'good', 'one', 'such', 'Am', 'Legend', ""'m"", 'really', 'bigtime', 'So', ""'ve"", 'been', 'eagerly', 'anticipating', 'Book', 'Eli', 'time', 'first', 'trailers', 'appeared', 'now', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'were', 'many', 'things', 'liked', 'Start', 'mythic', 'prophet', 'main', 'character', 'super-heroic', 'weapons', 'skills', 'showed', 'was', 'something', 'unique', 'early', 'scenes', 'were', 'generally', 'pretty', 'cool', 'were', 'spread', 'out', 'pretty', 'well', 'length', 'film', 'more', 'fight', 'scenes', 'would', 'have', 'bored', 'Eli', 'story', 'out', 'kind', 'grim', 'determinism', 'also', 'hopeful', 'elements', 'well', 'was', 'glad', 'was', ""n't"", 'previously', 'familiar', 'story', 'major', 'revelations', 'Book', 'final', 'act', 'were', 'complete', 'surprise', 'Mr.', 'Washington', 'was', 'excellent', 'choice', 'lead', 'Other', 'roles', 'were', 'well', 'cast', 'too', 'including', 'surprise', 'Jennifer', 'Beals', 'blind', 'mistress', 'Gary', 'Oldman', 'bad', 'boss', 'character', 'Oldman', 'struck', 'just', 'right', 'notes', 'ego', 'madness', 'desperation', 'Anyway', 'as', 'far', 'post-apoc', 'nature', 'movie', 'fascinating', 'glimpses', 'possessions', 'would', 'be', 'really', 'valuable', 'world', 'ex.', 'chapstick', 'yes', 'cigarette', 'lighter', 'not', 'so', 'much', 'other', 'aspects', 'survival', 'felt', 'very', 'authentic', 'film', 'was', ""n't"", 'quite', 'adventure', 'was', 'expecting', 'occasional', 'pacing', 'issues', 'still', 'found', 'be', 'enjoyable', 'viewing', 'experience']",N/A

1311131,A3AU53UWBG67ZB,B002ZG997C,"W.T. ""W.T.""","[4, 7]","The Book of Eli was a moving experience for me.  The story revolves around a wanderer named Eli who carries the last existing copy of the King James Bible for 30 years looking for the right person to give it to.  Along the way, he encounters the harsh reality of the post-apocalyptic world around him (a brutal environment, lawlessness, and a very determined local town boss named Carnegie who wants the book as a tool to control people).  The movie has a lot to say, which is refreshing for a movie with a lot of action.  In fact, it's hard to argue against The Book of Eli having more message behind it than any other major movie in years.  It examines the role of pure faith in our lives and how it interacts with the more earthly thing we call religion, which can be used for great good or great evil.The central conflict is between Eli and Carnegie.  Both are ultimately archetypes.  Eli is the humble man who lives what most of us would consider a near-ideal of absolute faith and dedication, with his one flaw being that he sometimes puts his task to protect the bible ahead of living by the teachings inside it.  In truth, this isn't so much a fault as a survival necessity if he is ever going to complete his mission to hand off the book, but it still is an issue that comes to bother him.  In this way, Eli reflects us all, and in his mission, he reflects a better way of living and the hope of building back a better world than the one that was destroyed.  Carnegie, for me, represents the desire to build back the world we currently live in.  For all he villainous ways, he's ultimately just a reflection of our modern world.  If he could get the bible, he would use it to gain personal power as he used religion as a tool to build an empire of followers around him, like a modern-day Mohammad (in the realpolitik military and political sense).  Probably he would also make people's lives easier and better superficially as he created more new towns and got ""civilization"" started again, but he desires the same corrupted world we live in today.  It's no coincidence that he's named after a legendary figure in our world who was very powerful and who shaped our civilization in a lot of ways.  It's also no coincidence that he is the one guy who acts and talks like someone from our world.  Excellent, seminal stuff.  Denzel Washington deserves an Oscar for his stoic, perfect performance.The other delicious part of The Book of Eli is the twist revelation late in the movie.  It caught me completely by surprise, but it fit the tone of the movie perfectly, and it made so much sense looking back.  It's one of those movies like Sixth Sense where you'll want to re-watch it after you find out just to see if the filmmakers covered all their bases!  That injects a little extra fun and life into the movie just at the time when the story itself is becoming more hopeful and rebirth dominates as a theme.Very highly recommended!  The smartest movie I've seen this year.  (Granted, it's only early February.)",5,"A movie with something to say, and the best twist since Sixth Sense!",1265587200,"02 8, 2010",2010,3017,"['Book', 'Eli', 'was', 'moving', 'experience', 'story', 'around', 'wanderer', 'named', 'Eli', 'who', 'last', 'existing', 'copy', 'King', 'James', 'Bible', '30', 'years', 'looking', 'right', 'person', 'give', 'way', 'harsh', 'reality', 'post-apocalyptic', 'world', 'brutal', 'environment', 'lawlessness', 'very', 'determined', 'local', 'town', 'boss', 'named', 'Carnegie', 'who', 'book', 'tool', 'control', 'people', 'movie', 'lot', 'say', 'refreshing', 'movie', 'lot', 'action', 'fact', 'hard', 'argue', 'Book', 'Eli', 'having', 'more', 'message', 'other', 'major', 'movie', 'years', 'role', 'pure', 'faith', 'lives', 'how', 'more', 'earthly', 'thing', 'call', 'religion', 'can', 'be', 'used', 'great', 'good', 'great', 'evil.The', 'central', 'conflict', 'Eli', 'Carnegie', 'are', 'ultimately', 'archetypes', 'Eli', 'humble', 'man', 'who', 'what', 'most', 'would', 'consider', 'near-ideal', 'absolute', 'faith', 'dedication', 'one', 'flaw', 'being', 'sometimes', 'task', 'protect', 'bible', 'ahead', 'living', 'teachings', 'truth', ""n't"", 'so', 'much', 'fault', 'survival', 'necessity', 'ever', 'going', 'complete', 'mission', 'hand', 'off', 'book', 'still', 'issue', 'bother', 'way', 'Eli', 'mission', 'better', 'way', 'living', 'hope', 'building', 'back', 'better', 'world', 'one', 'was', 'destroyed', 'Carnegie', 'desire', 'build', 'back', 'world', 'currently', 'live', 'villainous', 'ways', 'ultimately', 'just', 'reflection', 'modern', 'world', 'could', 'get', 'bible', 'would', 'use', 'gain', 'personal', 'power', 'used', 'religion', 'tool', 'build', 'empire', 'followers', 'modern-day', 'Mohammad', 'realpolitik', 'military', 'political', 'sense', 'Probably', 'would', 'also', 'make', 'people', 'lives', 'easier', 'better', 'superficially', 'created', 'more', 'new', 'towns', 'got', 'civilization', 'started', 'again', 'same', 'corrupted', 'world', 'live', 'today', 'coincidence', 'named', 'legendary', 'figure', 'world', 'who', 'was', 'very', 'powerful', 'who', 'shaped', 'civilization', 'lot', 'ways', 'also', 'coincidence', 'one', 'guy', 'who', 'talks', 'someone', 'world', 'Excellent', 'seminal', 'stuff', 'Denzel', 'Washington', 'Oscar', 'stoic', 'perfect', 'other', 'delicious', 'part', 'Book', 'Eli', 'twist', 'revelation', 'late', 'movie', 'caught', 'completely', 'surprise', 'fit', 'tone', 'movie', 'perfectly', 'made', 'so', 'much', 'sense', 'looking', 'back', 'one', 'movies', 'Sixth', 'Sense', 'where', ""'ll"", 'want', 're-watch', 'find', 'out', 'just', 'see', 'filmmakers', 'covered', 'bases', 'little', 'extra', 'fun', 'life', 'movie', 'just', 'time', 'when', 'story', 'becoming', 'more', 'hopeful', 'rebirth', 'dominates', 'theme.Very', 'highly', 'recommended', 'smartest', 'movie', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'year', 'Granted', 'only', 'early', 'February']",N/A

Book of Eli does neither of those things; instead letting the viewer decide the importance/meaning of the religious undertones.For a basic plot summary, Book of Eli focuses on a lone traveler (Denzel Washington) trying to survive in a post-apocalyptic America.  When one day he wanders into a rebuilding community, he is harassed by a man (Gary Oldman) who desires a powerful book that the traveler has in his possession.The plot of this film is okay, though at times predictable and/or slow.  However, there are three areas in which the film really excels:-Acting: Denzel and Oldman both give strong, professional performances, while Mila Kunis proves more than just a pretty face as well.-Imagery: The depiction of a completely desolate, war-torn nation is very powerful and interesting.  You never know what sort of crazy character you might meet next.-Religious Themes: The concept of religion is central to the entire film, but is shown as a potential force for good or evil.Thus, although Book of Eli isn't a masterpiece, it is easily interesting enough to entertain fans of Washington, thriller/action, and heavy thematic material.",4,"Finally, A Religiously-Oriented Film That Doesn't Pander/Preach",1280707200,"08 2, 2010",2010,1352,"['When', 'films', 'religious', 'trappings', 'one', 'two', 'things', 'usually', 'bashes', 'other', 'religions', 'favor', 'one', 'being', 'espoused', 'little', 'too', 'preachy', 'fawns', 'Book', 'Eli', 'things', 'instead', 'letting', 'viewer', 'importance/meaning', 'religious', 'undertones.For', 'basic', 'plot', 'summary', 'Book', 'Eli', 'focuses', 'lone', 'traveler', 'Denzel', 'Washington', 'trying', 'survive', 'post-apocalyptic', 'America', 'When', 'one', 'day', 'rebuilding', 'community', 'harassed', 'man', 'Gary', 'Oldman', 'who', 'powerful', 'book', 'traveler', 'possession.The', 'plot', 'film', 'okay', 'though', 'times', 'predictable', 'and/or', 'slow', 'However', 'are', 'three', 'areas', 'film', 'really', 'excels', '-Acting', 'Denzel', 'Oldman', 'give', 'strong', 'professional', 'performances', 'Mila', 'Kunis', 'more', 'just', 'pretty', 'face', 'well.-Imagery', 'depiction', 'completely', 'desolate', 'war-torn', 'nation', 'very', 'powerful', 'interesting', 'never', 'know', 'what', 'sort', 'crazy', 'character', 'might', 'meet', 'next.-Religious', 'Themes', 'concept', 'religion', 'central', 'entire', 'film', 'shown', 'potential', 'force', 'good', 'evil.Thus', 'Book', 'Eli', ""n't"", 'masterpiece', 'easily', 'interesting', 'enough', 'entertain', 'fans', 'Washington', 'thriller/action', 'heavy', 'thematic', 'material']",N/A
