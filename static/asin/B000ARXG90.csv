932519,AQ8DU6XVA3USJ,B000ARXG90,"Alejandra Vernon ""artist & illustrator""","[13, 16]","""The Walk,"" despite its flaws, has many things to offer the viewer; some very fine performances, a script by Carlyle Chalmers that has relevance, and most of all, lots of heart. Behind the camera, Jon Swindoll has a good eye for composition and color contrasts, keeping our visual attention, and director Thomas Forbes maintains an even pacing that never lags. The plot, though predictable, is well done, and concernes a girl brought up in a close knit Christian family, who goes astray when her father dies, hooks up with a bad guy, has a baby, becomes an insolent brat towards her mother, etc. She gets in trouble through her connection to a stolen credit card, has to do community service, and meets the young minister in charge of troubled youth, bringing her to ""come the full circle through divine guidance.""The cast is interesting, and often very good. Eva Pigford is gorgeous (she won the ""America's Next Top Model"" contest) and does well as Sydney, the central figure in the story. Exceptional are R&B; singer Regina Bell as Sylvia, her mother, and Teck Holmes (""The Real World"") as the young man, Rev. Whitman Hester, who preaches about Elijah (1 Kings 18) in a rousing sermon. Also memorable are Charles Black as Reverend Baker, Courtney Wilson as the tough detective, and in a bizarre bit of humor, Alex Orr as ""The Nutty Chef."" Filmed on location in the Atlanta, Georgia area, this is a fine Christian family film. Total running time is 80 minutes.",4,A Small Film with a Big Heart,1131753600,"11 12, 2005",2005,1461,"['Walk', 'flaws', 'many', 'things', 'offer', 'viewer', 'very', 'fine', 'performances', 'script', 'Carlyle', 'Chalmers', 'relevance', 'most', 'lots', 'heart', 'camera', 'Jon', 'Swindoll', 'good', 'eye', 'composition', 'color', 'contrasts', 'keeping', 'visual', 'attention', 'director', 'Thomas', 'Forbes', 'even', 'pacing', 'never', 'plot', 'predictable', 'well', 'done', 'girl', 'brought', 'up', 'close', 'knit', 'Christian', 'family', 'who', 'astray', 'when', 'father', 'dies', 'up', 'bad', 'guy', 'baby', 'insolent', 'brat', 'mother', 'etc', 'trouble', 'connection', 'stolen', 'credit', 'card', 'do', 'community', 'service', 'young', 'minister', 'charge', 'troubled', 'youth', 'bringing', 'come', 'full', 'circle', 'divine', 'guidance', 'cast', 'interesting', 'often', 'very', 'good', 'Eva', 'Pigford', 'gorgeous', 'won', 'America', 'Next', 'Top', 'Model', 'contest', 'well', 'Sydney', 'central', 'figure', 'story', 'Exceptional', 'are', 'R', 'B', 'singer', 'Regina', 'Bell', 'Sylvia', 'mother', 'Teck', 'Holmes', 'Real', 'World', 'young', 'man', 'Rev', 'Whitman', 'Hester', 'who', 'Elijah', '1', 'Kings', '18', 'rousing', 'sermon', 'Also', 'memorable', 'are', 'Charles', 'Black', 'Reverend', 'Baker', 'Courtney', 'Wilson', 'tough', 'detective', 'bizarre', 'bit', 'humor', 'Alex', 'Orr', 'Nutty', 'Chef', 'Filmed', 'location', 'Atlanta', 'Georgia', 'area', 'fine', 'Christian', 'family', 'film', 'Total', 'running', 'time', '80', 'minutes']","Walk, The"

932521,ACXHNOC6L8LUO,B000ARXG90,Artist & Author,"[9, 10]","I hate to 'trash' a movie that is trying to bring a good message about Christianity, but this movie suffers in several ways.  First, the photography is somewhat strange, with an eerie light cast over the whole movie.  Second, the acting is just that, acting; few, if any, of the characters have done enough acting to really be able to get 'into' their role . . . to make it lifelike.  Finally, I think the plot, or editing, is somewhat confusing so in the end they resort to a long sermon.  The film does try to bring a Christian message, but it is like most 'Christian' movies in that the message is more important than the story, so the story seems contrived to get the message across.  I'd say that this movie is best left to showings in church youth groups where it serves as a springboard for discussion in the group.[For an outstanding movie with a Christian message that does not in any way seem contrived, see the Disney movie 'Ruby Bridges.']",3,Typical Christian Movie Quality,1154304000,"07 31, 2006",2006,951,"['hate', ""'trash"", 'movie', 'trying', 'bring', 'good', 'message', 'Christianity', 'movie', 'several', 'ways', 'First', 'photography', 'somewhat', 'strange', 'eerie', 'light', 'cast', 'whole', 'movie', 'Second', 'acting', 'just', 'acting', 'few', 'characters', 'have', 'done', 'enough', 'acting', 'really', 'be', 'able', 'get', ""'into"", 'role', 'make', 'lifelike', 'Finally', 'think', 'plot', 'editing', 'somewhat', 'confusing', 'so', 'end', 'resort', 'long', 'sermon', 'film', 'try', 'bring', 'Christian', 'message', 'most', ""'Christian"", 'movies', 'message', 'more', 'important', 'story', 'story', 'contrived', 'get', 'message', ""'d"", 'say', 'movie', 'best', 'left', 'showings', 'church', 'youth', 'groups', 'where', 'springboard', 'discussion', 'group', '[', 'outstanding', 'movie', 'Christian', 'message', 'not', 'way', 'seem', 'contrived', 'see', 'Disney', 'movie', 'Bridges', ']']","Walk, The"
