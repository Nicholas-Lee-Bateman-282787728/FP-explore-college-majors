1655831,A3AHNKB0DLR76K,B00DJSUOTM,Busy Mom,"[2, 4]","This movie had promise by looking at the trailer. But it didn't live up to it in any way. Thora Birch's character was rotten to the core, hard to watch, hard to believe, and the acting was awful. The actor who played the son Charlie was good. The mom was awesome. But they had no support from either storyline or other actors. Skip this movie, you'll never get those two hours back.Plus, it streamed VERY slowly from Amazon. Every time I needed to stop or rewind, I waited for several minutes (like 5 to 10).",1,Not good.

1655832,A25L1GQF65K55K,B00DJSUOTM,Craig Haynes,"[4, 4]","The television (PBS) psychologist John Bradshaw, PhD, once quipped, 98% of American families are dysfunctional--and the other 2% is in denial. From what I have observed of my own 'family' and others, that seems about right. The family Petunia seems downright well-adjusted compared to my family (e.g., after decades of deceit, I just learned the man who 'raised' me--and abused me emotionally and physically--is/was NOT my biological father, that explains the abuse). The Petunia family seems to face their crises head-on, without flinching and then set about to try and bring some comfort and solace through honest communication, intervention and effort. While uplifting, that may be a bit Pollyanna in reality. However, in the film's defense of taking this approach, the mother in the film is, after all, a psychologist--so that does have a certain ring of truth and one can fully understand how this approach might happen. I thought Eric Urie was absolutely delightful. That kind of ambiguous, unsure sexuality is so appealing--on screen! In real life, I would hate to be the person(s), involved with someone who moves on the sexual continuum without a real sense of the impact of their ambiguity on others. This character via Urie's performance, doesn't knowingly or willingly inflict pain--it is just the collateral damage of being what and who he is at a particular point in time. In the case of Urie's character, he does find resolution, but who really knows. Lahti, Rasche and the others all deliver fine performances. Dysfunction handled in this dark comedy manner really succeeds without bringing us so down, we can't look-up. However, there are films that tackle dysfunction on a downward trajectory without any humor and don't look back--think American Beauty, Ordinary People, Imaginary Heroes or the Ice Storm.",4,"Dysfunctional families are so screwed-up, but so interesting.",1387065600,"12 15, 2013",2013,1824,"['television', 'PBS', 'psychologist', 'John', 'Bradshaw', 'PhD', 'once', 'quipped', '98', '%', 'American', 'families', 'are', 'dysfunctional', 'other', '2', '%', 'denial', 'what', 'have', 'observed', 'own', ""'family"", 'others', 'about', 'right', 'family', 'Petunia', 'downright', 'well-adjusted', 'compared', 'family', 'e.g.', 'decades', 'deceit', 'just', 'learned', 'man', 'who', ""'raised"", 'abused', 'emotionally', 'physically', 'is/was', 'NOT', 'biological', 'father', 'abuse', 'Petunia', 'family', 'face', 'crises', 'head-on', 'flinching', 'then', 'set', 'try', 'bring', 'comfort', 'solace', 'honest', 'communication', 'intervention', 'effort', 'uplifting', 'may', 'be', 'bit', 'Pollyanna', 'reality', 'However', 'film', 'defense', 'taking', 'approach', 'mother', 'film', 'psychologist', 'so', 'have', 'certain', 'ring', 'truth', 'one', 'can', 'fully', 'understand', 'how', 'approach', 'might', 'happen', 'thought', 'Eric', 'Urie', 'was', 'absolutely', 'delightful', 'kind', 'ambiguous', 'unsure', 'sexuality', 'so', 'appealing', 'screen', 'real', 'life', 'would', 'hate', 'be', 'person', 's', 'involved', 'someone', 'who', 'sexual', 'continuum', 'real', 'sense', 'impact', 'ambiguity', 'others', 'character', 'Urie', 'performance', ""n't"", 'knowingly', 'willingly', 'inflict', 'pain', 'just', 'collateral', 'damage', 'being', 'what', 'who', 'particular', 'point', 'time', 'case', 'Urie', 'character', 'find', 'resolution', 'who', 'really', 'Lahti', 'Rasche', 'others', 'deliver', 'fine', 'performances', 'Dysfunction', 'handled', 'dark', 'comedy', 'manner', 'really', 'bringing', 'so', 'down', 'ca', ""n't"", 'look-up', 'However', 'are', 'films', 'tackle', 'dysfunction', 'downward', 'trajectory', 'humor', 'do', ""n't"", 'look', 'back', 'think', 'American', 'Beauty', 'Ordinary', 'People', 'Imaginary', 'Heroes', 'Ice', 'Storm']",Petunia

But my attitude towards it softened in that there was at least resolution of the plotlines (there are a few) in the end and parts of it are rather thought-provoking.  It's a family drama that won't convert you if you don't like family dramas (or stories about dysfunctional families), but if you can see the entertainment value in dysfunction, there is something to like here.  It's worth a viewing if you feel open to watching a film that is low on action and high on internal conflict.",4,Straddles the line between good and terrible,1390953600,"01 29, 2014",2014,651,"['watched', 'movie', 'was', 'concerned', 'was', 'going', 'be', 'one', 'films', 'where', 'everyone', 'odd', 'unrealistic', 'degree', 'really', 'story', 'attitude', 'softened', 'was', 'least', 'resolution', 'plotlines', 'are', 'few', 'end', 'parts', 'are', 'rather', 'thought-provoking', 'family', 'drama', 'wo', ""n't"", 'convert', 'do', ""n't"", 'like', 'family', 'dramas', 'stories', 'dysfunctional', 'families', 'can', 'see', 'entertainment', 'value', 'dysfunction', 'something', 'like', 'here', 'viewing', 'feel', 'open', 'watching', 'film', 'low', 'action', 'high', 'internal', 'conflict']",Petunia

LOVED IT!Michael Urie (Ugly Betty) surprised me about half way through it as I finally realized it was indeed him.  Funny what a pair of glasses and different mannerisms can do for a character.As for the folks complaining about ""what a bunch of cry babies"" and ""worst movie ever"" and this and that... well I grew up in a very similar house hold in FLORIDA, my adopted mom was a psychologist working at the University of South Florida and single.  We had allot of interesting people in and out of the house all the time so that made things even more interesting, all walks of life I might add.  Helped me understand my trying to figure out my own sexual identity which turned out my being a young gay person.I thought all the conversations were realistic from MY point of view. I understood when the characters were frustrated and going through the roof needing to be loved and paid attention to.  My mom was an alcoholic and type A personality so you can only imagine what it was like needing and missing the guidance, love and attention that any young person really needs to flourish.  And it's left me some pretty obvious deep seated scars.  But, in a way, this movie was like therapy for me because only a child raised in a weird upbringing like that could actually understand, relate and even enjoy what was being shown on the screen.KUDOS to the entire cast, director, screen writer, camera man for some very interesting angles and everyone else involved.
