Not that this was apparent at the time, wgen Sabzian had his moment in the sun, and the President was a nobody, but it emphasizes just how human a character Sabzian is. Sabzian, incidentally, is easily the best 'actor' in the film; the others (especially the rich family members, seem amateurs, which adds to the 'realism' as well as highlighting the dissonance between the real and near real. Closeup occupies an odd spot in a pantheon of films that includes the whole of Michael Moore's quasi-documentaries, as well as Orson Welles' brilliant F For Fake. Yet, this film feels 'realer,' and all the credit must go to Kiarostami for, technically, the film is shot very simply and plainly- no fancy shots nor editing by cinematographer Ali Reza Zarrin-Dast. Just the facts, and its what Kiarostami includes and excludes that makes this film, rather than breaks it. And, in a case of what may be 'poetic justice,' the film worshipping Sabzian actually does become the star of his own film- not one he made- as he dreamt of doing, but one which was made about him and his dream's destruction.Ultimately, the film plays out like one of those old nested folk dolls within a folk doll, within a folk doll, etc. in that films led to a real life situation which led to another real life experience which led to a film. It is not quite a great film, but far closer to it than one might conceive such a bare bones film, with such a simple premise, could archive. And all the credit for this must go to Kiarostami- a man whose art clearly is a synergy of lesser things. It will be interesting to see just how high his work can reach, if he was just able to get a bit more to work with. Close-Up is a film any lover of cinema should see, and even those who are vapid, because Hossain Sabzian is likely the best mirror those sorts will ever get.",3,Good,1340236800,"06 21, 2012",2012,2086,"['film', 'was', 'made', 'almost', 'two', 'decades', 'ago', 'odd', 'feeling', 'one', 'watching', 'Sabzuian', 'very', 'much', 'Iran', 'current', 'wacko', 'President', 'Mahmoud', 'Ahmadinejad', 'antipodal', 'man', 'nature', 'demeanor', 'Not', 'was', 'apparent', 'time', 'wgen', 'Sabzian', 'had', 'moment', 'sun', 'President', 'was', 'nobody', 'just', 'how', 'human', 'character', 'Sabzian', 'Sabzian', 'incidentally', 'easily', 'best', ""'actor"", 'film', 'others', 'especially', 'rich', 'family', 'members', 'seem', 'amateurs', ""'realism"", 'as', 'well', 'highlighting', 'dissonance', 'real', 'near', 'real', 'Closeup', 'odd', 'spot', 'pantheon', 'films', 'whole', 'Michael', 'Moore', 'quasi-documentaries', 'as', 'well', 'Orson', 'Welles', 'brilliant', 'F', 'Fake', 'film', ""'realer"", 'credit', 'must', 'go', 'Kiarostami', 'technically', 'film', 'shot', 'very', 'simply', 'plainly-', 'fancy', 'shots', 'editing', 'cinematographer', 'Ali', 'Reza', 'Zarrin-Dast', 'Just', 'facts', 'what', 'Kiarostami', 'film', 'rather', 'breaks', 'case', 'what', 'may', 'be', ""'poetic"", 'justice', 'film', 'worshipping', 'Sabzian', 'actually', 'become', 'star', 'own', 'film-', 'not', 'one', 'made-', 'doing', 'one', 'was', 'made', 'dream', 'destruction.Ultimately', 'film', 'out', 'one', 'old', 'nested', 'folk', 'dolls', 'folk', 'doll', 'folk', 'doll', 'etc', 'films', 'led', 'real', 'life', 'situation', 'led', 'real', 'life', 'experience', 'led', 'film', 'not', 'quite', 'great', 'film', 'far', 'closer', 'one', 'might', 'conceive', 'such', 'bare', 'film', 'simple', 'premise', 'could', 'archive', 'credit', 'must', 'go', 'Kiarostami-', 'man', 'art', 'clearly', 'synergy', 'lesser', 'things', 'will', 'be', 'interesting', 'see', 'just', 'how', 'high', 'work', 'can', 'reach', 'was', 'just', 'able', 'get', 'bit', 'more', 'work', 'Close-Up', 'film', 'lover', 'cinema', 'should', 'see', 'even', 'who', 'are', 'vapid', 'Hossain', 'Sabzian', 'likely', 'best', 'mirror', 'sorts', 'will', 'ever', 'get']",N/A
1337017,A2C7BOQVFH1HLE,B003D63G5E,Frederick Baptist,"[0, 5]","This is the second Iranian film that I've watched with the first one being also on this disc as the Special Feature bonus ""The Traveler"" which I actually enjoyed watching more than the main course.  ""Close-Up"" isn't bad it's just that ""The Traveler"" moved me more and appears to be the overall better film.  This Criterion Collection Blu-ray version of the film is a mixed bag.  The picture quality is patchy with some frames looking really good on 1080p and the others not so good.  The sound quality only comes in mono which isn't too bad given that this film is mostly dialogue-driven but still it would have been nice to have had surround sound options.The storyline is interesting though about a poor man who dares to dream outside of his current position in life resorting to escapism in the form of becoming a movie nut and imagining too deeply about being his own favourite movie director, Makhmalbaf, that when the chance came along to impersonate him, he decides to play along to see just how far he can get away with it.  You sense that although he expressed remorse in court to escape jail-time his moment in the sun when he was able to fool people in a higher social status than him albeit for a short while that he was actually pleased that he was able to pull off the very thing that he had always dreamt of being which is a famous and good actor.  He had that satisfied look that said that ""I'm so poor there is nothing really worse that you can do to me but you cannot take away the fact I was able to act so well to get away with it for so long and to enjoy my 15 minutes of fame and now my life is complete!""This is a touching story and you can't help but root for the underdog and it shows the great gap between the rich and the poor and how despondent the poor can get when it seems no matter how hard they try they cannot break out of their realities except in the dream or fantasy world and for Sabzian at least for a while he had great difficulty distinguishing between the real and the unreal.Overall this is a good Criterion release seeing as how you get two feature films and while ""Close-Up"" is good I still liked ""The Traveler"" better.",3,Kiarostami's Famous Film Now On Criterion Blu Ray To Mixed Results!,1310860800,"07 17, 2011",2011,2164,"['second', 'Iranian', 'film', ""'ve"", 'watched', 'first', 'one', 'being', 'also', 'disc', 'Special', 'Feature', 'bonus', 'Traveler', 'actually', 'enjoyed', 'watching', 'more', 'main', 'course', 'Close-Up', ""n't"", 'bad', 'just', 'Traveler', 'moved', 'more', 'be', 'overall', 'better', 'film', 'Criterion', 'Collection', 'Blu-ray', 'version', 'film', 'mixed', 'bag', 'picture', 'quality', 'patchy', 'frames', 'looking', 'really', 'good', '1080p', 'others', 'not', 'so', 'good', 'sound', 'quality', 'only', 'mono', ""n't"", 'too', 'bad', 'given', 'film', 'mostly', 'dialogue-driven', 'still', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'nice', 'have', 'had', 'surround', 'options.The', 'storyline', 'interesting', 'poor', 'man', 'who', 'dream', 'current', 'position', 'life', 'resorting', 'escapism', 'form', 'becoming', 'movie', 'nut', 'imagining', 'too', 'deeply', 'being', 'own', 'favourite', 'movie', 'director', 'Makhmalbaf', 'when', 'chance', 'came', 'along', 'impersonate', 'play', 'along', 'see', 'just', 'how', 'far', 'can', 'get', 'away', 'sense', 'expressed', 'remorse', 'court', 'escape', 'jail-time', 'moment', 'sun', 'when', 'was', 'able', 'fool', 'people', 'higher', 'social', 'status', 'albeit', 'short', 'while', 'was', 'actually', 'pleased', 'was', 'able', 'pull', 'off', 'very', 'thing', 'had', 'always', 'dreamt', 'being', 'famous', 'good', 'actor', 'had', 'satisfied', 'look', 'said', ""'m"", 'so', 'poor', 'nothing', 'really', 'worse', 'can', 'do', 'can', 'not', 'take', 'away', 'fact', 'was', 'able', 'act', 'so', 'well', 'get', 'away', 'so', 'long', 'enjoy', '15', 'minutes', 'fame', 'now', 'life', 'complete', 'touching', 'story', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'root', 'underdog', 'great', 'gap', 'rich', 'poor', 'how', 'despondent', 'poor', 'can', 'get', 'when', 'matter', 'how', 'hard', 'try', 'can', 'not', 'break', 'realities', 'dream', 'fantasy', 'world', 'Sabzian', 'least', 'while', 'had', 'great', 'difficulty', 'distinguishing', 'real', 'unreal.Overall', 'good', 'Criterion', 'release', 'seeing', 'how', 'get', 'two', 'feature', 'films', 'Close-Up', 'good', 'still', 'liked', 'Traveler', 'better']",N/A

1337019,AQE41QO3NEUMW,B003D63G5E,"Ronald Scheer ""rockysquirrel""","[7, 7]","Shot in 40 days, using courtroom footage and reenactments with people playing themselves, this ""new wave"" film by Iranian director Abbas Kiarostami is an absorbing journey into the nature of identity. What does an ordinary man become when he is assumed to be someone famous? The answer can be poignant, as it is in this film, and surprisingly complex.Moved by director Mohsen Makhmalbaf's film ""The Cyclist,"" a divorced and unemployed printer's assistant pretends for a moment to a fellow bus passenger that he is the director himself. Suddenly becoming the object of respect and admiration, he allows himself to be drawn into a ruse involving an entire family, who believe that he wants to make a movie about them.Legally, he admits in court, he is guilty of fraud. But morally, he argues, he has not done and never intended any harm. He has the heart and soul of an artist, which the limited circumstances of his life have never permitted him to be. Respected and admired, taken seriously maybe for the first time in his life, he is lifted out of his suffering. How this is all played out before the cameras makes for a fascinating study of art, imagination, and self.
