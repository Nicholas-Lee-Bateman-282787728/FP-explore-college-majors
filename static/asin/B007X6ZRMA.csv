Great, new music was coming out all the time, filling the airwaves and stereo speakers with incredible new sounds.  Some of the new sounds came in the form of Pink Floyd's Wish You Were Here - the follow-up to their record breaking, history making The Dark Side of the Moon.Sited by fans and band members alike as their favorite album, it went straight to number one on the charts in both their native England as well as in the U.S. as well as topping the charts in other countries, as well.This rockumentary tells the very interesting story of the making of this iconic album through new interviews with Roger Waters, David Gilmour and Nick Mason as well as archive interviews with the late Richard Wright who passed away in 2008 just one week before the release of the concert DVD by his band mate, David Gilmore, entitled Live in Gdansk on which he played keyboards.  There are also interviews with the sleeve designer, Storm Thorgerson, the ""burning man"" on the album cover, Ronnie Rondell, the recording engineer, Brian Humphries, and guest vocalist, Roy Harper.Of particular interest to me was the discussions amongst the remaining band members of their ex-band mate, Sid Barrett, who they sung about in the song, Shine On You Crazy Diamond, and his unexpected visit to the Abbey Road studios while the band was working on Wish You Were Here. They also share an astonishing photo of the psychedelic genius in his later years.  Obviously, Waters, Gilmore and Mason still have a tremendous soft spot in their hearts for their late, tortured friend who passed away in 2006.  The band also discusses the album's theme of music industry greed as well as ""absence"".The Story of Wish You Were Here is one of those rare documentaries that warrant repeated viewings because of the incredible wealth of information and revelation contained within it.

Less technical than the preceding Making of The Dark Side of the Moon, it's more invested in uncovering the messages and meanings behind each track than the efforts that went into producing the finished sound. It still spends some time unraveling the aural onion skin behind an enormous mixing board, but Waters, Gilmour and company are caught in a more reflective, philosophical mood that delves into the recurring themes of the album, rather than the motions they were making with their hands. As usual, the band is anything but level-headed, but beyond their superficial egotism lies a dense, intellectual shared nature with plenty of wisdom and substantial meaning to share. They're smart, deep guys, but god are they in love with themselves.

1539567,A31T9O4SRD94PJ,B007X6ZRMA,Dusty Rhodes,"[3, 3]","I thouroughly enjoyed watching this program, and will in coming years.  First, the music.  Waters and Gilmore strumming the tune, the four notes that set it off, and singing the songs.  Acoustic, unedited, after all these years a bit raw. Juxtaposed with wonderful concert footage.  Great insight and inspiration as the sound engineer pushes the (analog) levers to isolate voices, making the music burst, and enhancing the enjoyment of the finished album.  Second, the visuals.  I don't recall seeing the animation, but maybe at a concert?  It's great.  The artist tells of the creative process and about working with the band members.  I won't spoil it, but what an event it was getting the photos of the burning man and the diving man at Mono Lake. Their creative process sounds familiar, creative blocks, distractions of life's events, arguments and disagreements, strange people showing up, followed by reconciliation, creative harmonizing, and the finished product being greater than the components. A surprisingly painful process.  Not the effortless flow of genius like Mozart I had invisioned.Third, then and now.  Us and Them.  Focused mainly on Gilmour and Rogers, with Mason, Wright and, en abstentia, Barrett, Floyd members give us insight and heart.  When Gilmore reflects on their former bandmate, Syd Barrett, he exudes the vulnerable heart and soul of the band and their brilliance in its expression.  He almost whispers his regret over the absence of what was possible, but is lost, with Barrett.  To the Machine.  Gilmour holds in sublime understanding the fragility of this life.  It's invisible but always there, ""The Dark Side of the Moon"".  Rogers seems more acerbic, ""Remember when you were young, you shone like the sun"".  He illuminates the real dilema, ""We're just two lost souls... running over the same old ground, [living with] the same old fear"".  Rogers expression lets us know that he still wishes, wishes for the resolution to the fearful choice:  whether to live the risky but fullfilled life of the hero or to exist in the effortless but empty life of a worker drone.  The endless question and quest is still on Rogers face.  The paradoxical challenge.  Watching this program, I better understand the pain, anger and inertia the band members experienced when they woke to the realization of being cogs in the relentless gears of the music industry i.e. modern life.Considered one of the best Pink Floyd concerts, the May 9, 1977 ""In the Flesh"" tour concert at the Oakland Colliseum is on YouTube.  Pink Floyd performed Animals and Wish You Were Here. I was there with Santa Cruz college friends.  The atmosphere was hazey, but the show was crystal clear.  The sound system and set must have cost hundreds of thousands, and the band wore jeans and laughed.  It was a life envigorating and transforming event.  The aireal parade of house sized animals, people and a refrigerator#?# was awesome. The light show was astounding.

1539571,AC0C4R4RK1WP7,B007X6ZRMA,"Jim Stalker ""Jim Stalker""","[10, 10]","Essentially borrowing the format of the ""Classic Albums"" series, Eagle Vision and Kayos Productions has just released the excellent Pink Floyd - The Story of WIsh You Were Here on DVD.Packed with new interviews of the three surviving Floyds (and some old ones with the departed keyboardist Richard Wright) this outstanding documentary sheds light on the quartets follow up to Dark Side of the Moon.Dark Side of the Moon is arguably one of the finest classic rock albums ever. Moon was on the Billboard chart for a record 741 consecutive weeks. A true concept album that matches brilliant lyrics with memorable melodies. Packaged with iconic cover-art imagery and innovative recording studio trickery - Moon is a true watershed in rock and roll.The story of that album is brilliantly captured in one of Classic Albums finest installments (for Dark Side of the Moon). Not only did Moon propel the Floyd from astral-jam band cult-status into mainstream super-stardom but it also set the stage for their eventual break up as Waters began to assert his dictatorial control.The story of the pressure of following up Moon and power struggles within the band are vividly captured on the new DVD. The dots from David Gilmore's breakthrough four-note opening riff to Roger Waters' decision to make Wish You Were Here a concept album about departed founder Syd Barrett are all connected here.The biggest challenge with these types of documentaries is that many musicians who were there are bumbling idiots, drug burnouts, or worse of all... dead.  They can not remember nor explain the past. To compensate these documentaries bring in talking head ringers who weren't there to flesh out the story. This is very hit or miss.Fortunately leader/lyricist/bassist Roger Waters, guitarist/singer David Gilmour, drummer Nick Mason, and keyboardist Richard Wright are some of the most articulate of all rock musicians. Not only do they recall the story, but they tell it with drama and perspective.  The story is told largely through their words.There too are the scenes at the mixing board where parts of the album are isolated and replayed with commentary -  a classic albums staple. These scenes are terrific. The interviews with the artists who did the albums ""burning man"" cover are also excellent.For many Floyd fans Wish You Were Here is the most intimate of their albums. Perhaps this is due to the connection the band felt with Syd - as all were clearly affected by his burn out and subsequent exit from the band. Could be. There is a certain ominousness to his visit to the studio and all strain holding back emotion as they recall the story.Whatever the case, Here serves up an undeniably great triumvirate of rock classics, ""Shine on You Crazy Diamond"" ""Have a Cigar"" and ""Wish You Were Here"" - which will forever be played anywhere classic rock is.Therefore classic rock fans should not miss this terrific documentary!

The ""Dark Side"" documentary was very well-done -- one of the best in that series, which also includes an excellent look at the birth of the Who's ""Who's Next."" But I was absolutely bowled over by ""The Story of Wish You Were Here,"" and even learned some things I hadn't known about my all-time favorite Pink Floyd album.The interviews with band members David Gilmour, Nick Mason and Roger Waters are a natural element, of course, as are the archival Q-and-A's with keyboardist Rick Wright, who died in 2008. But the producers went beyond the band, including moments with engineer Brian Humphries, guest vocalist Roy Harper, and even stuntman Ronnie Rondell, who was the ""burning man"" on the original WYWH cover.I suppose I must have read at some point how Gilmour's mournful, four-note guitar phrase was so important to the composition of ""Shine On You Crazy Diamond,"" but here, both Waters and Gilmour seem to be in agreement that this little snippet of music came early and influenced, basically, the entire construction of that epic song.Very nice it is, too, to watch as the documentary cuts back and forth between Gilmour and Waters each singing and playing on acoustic guitars his own contemporary version of the album's title track, ""Wish You Were Here."" Gilmour was filmed playing a lush rythm part on 12-string guitar, and solo notes on 6-string, while Waters picks out the entire tune on a black 6-string acoustic. I've always preferred Gilmour's warmer voice to Waters', but the latter's has aged well -- Waters' range has dropped, as can happen with older singers, but in his case it's been a blessing. His rendering of the song here -- his restrained, almost whispered delivery, and his wonderfully clipped, wistful phrasing -- reminded me very much of Bob Dylan at his best.It's a marvelous performance, starker and far more ghostly than Gilmour's rich rendering, but it holds its own. It's a reminder that these guys, when they were at their best and before their creative differences made it impossible for them to keep working together, brought distinct but needed skills to Pink Floyd. Waters was ever the intellectual, the gifted, philosophical lyricist, and Gilmour the powerful, more musical counterpart. Adding in Wright's soulful keys and voice, and Mason's rather jazzy drumming and humorous demeanort, and you had a group of four musicians who all had a hand in establishing Pink Floyd as one of the greatest bands in rock history.This video made me appreciate that all over again -- and also made me long to be young again, and to mourn ... again ... the tragic downfall of original Floyd singer/guitarist Syd Barrett, whose descent into madness inspired the entire ""Wish You Were Here"" album. Those days, from the band's first record in 1967 to the recording and release of ""Wish You Were Here"" in 1975, were strange, powerful, heady days indeed.",5,Can't find much to critique!,1343692800,"07 31, 2012",2012,3045,"['Having', 'owned', 'watched', 'repeatedly', 'Classic', 'Albums', 'making-of', 'DVD', 'Dark', 'Side', 'Moon', 'was', 'skeptical', 'Pink', 'Floyd', 'Story', 'Wish', 'Were', 'Here', 'Dark', 'Side', 'documentary', 'was', 'very', 'well-done', 'one', 'best', 'series', 'also', 'excellent', 'look', 'birth', 'Who', 'Who', 'Next', 'was', 'absolutely', 'bowled', 'over', 'Story', 'Wish', 'Were', 'Here', 'even', 'learned', 'things', 'had', ""n't"", 'known', 'all-time', 'favorite', 'Pink', 'Floyd', 'interviews', 'band', 'members', 'David', 'Gilmour', 'Nick', 'Mason', 'Roger', 'Waters', 'are', 'natural', 'element', 'course', 'are', 'archival', 'Q-and-A', 'keyboardist', 'Rick', 'Wright', 'who', 'died', '2008', 'producers', 'went', 'band', 'including', 'moments', 'engineer', 'Brian', 'Humphries', 'guest', 'vocalist', 'Roy', 'Harper', 'even', 'stuntman', 'Ronnie', 'Rondell', 'who', 'was', 'burning', 'man', 'original', 'WYWH', 'cover.I', 'suppose', 'must', 'have', 'read', 'point', 'how', 'Gilmour', 'mournful', 'four-note', 'guitar', 'phrase', 'was', 'so', 'important', 'composition', 'Shine', 'Crazy', 'Diamond', 'here', 'Waters', 'Gilmour', 'seem', 'be', 'agreement', 'little', 'snippet', 'music', 'came', 'early', 'influenced', 'basically', 'entire', 'construction', 'epic', 'song.Very', 'too', 'watch', 'documentary', 'cuts', 'back', 'forth', 'Gilmour', 'Waters', 'singing', 'playing', 'acoustic', 'guitars', 'own', 'contemporary', 'version', 'album', 'title', 'track', 'Wish', 'Were', 'Here', 'Gilmour', 'was', 'filmed', 'playing', 'lush', 'rythm', 'part', '12-string', 'guitar', 'solo', 'notes', '6-string', 'Waters', 'picks', 'out', 'entire', 'tune', 'black', '6-string', 'acoustic', ""'ve"", 'always', 'preferred', 'Gilmour', 'warmer', 'voice', 'Waters', 'latter', 'aged', 'well', 'Waters', 'range', 'dropped', 'can', 'happen', 'older', 'singers', 'case', 'been', 'blessing', 'rendering', 'song', 'here', 'restrained', 'almost', 'whispered', 'delivery', 'wonderfully', 'clipped', 'wistful', 'phrasing', 'reminded', 'very', 'much', 'Bob', 'Dylan', 'best.It', 'marvelous', 'performance', 'starker', 'far', 'more', 'ghostly', 'Gilmour', 'rich', 'rendering', 'own', 'reminder', 'guys', 'when', 'were', 'best', 'creative', 'differences', 'made', 'impossible', 'keep', 'working', 'together', 'brought', 'distinct', 'needed', 'skills', 'Pink', 'Floyd', 'Waters', 'was', 'ever', 'intellectual', 'gifted', 'philosophical', 'lyricist', 'Gilmour', 'powerful', 'more', 'musical', 'counterpart', 'Adding', 'Wright', 'soulful', 'keys', 'voice', 'Mason', 'rather', 'jazzy', 'drumming', 'humorous', 'demeanort', 'had', 'group', 'four', 'musicians', 'who', 'had', 'hand', 'establishing', 'Pink', 'Floyd', 'one', 'greatest', 'bands', 'rock', 'history.This', 'video', 'made', 'appreciate', 'over', 'again', 'also', 'made', 'long', 'be', 'young', 'again', 'mourn', 'again', 'tragic', 'downfall', 'original', 'Floyd', 'singer/guitarist', 'Syd', 'Barrett', 'descent', 'madness', 'inspired', 'entire', 'Wish', 'Were', 'Here', 'album', 'days', 'band', 'first', 'record', '1967', 'recording', 'release', 'Wish', 'Were', 'Here', '1975', 'were', 'strange', 'powerful', 'heady', 'days', 'indeed']",N/A

I've been a fan of Pink Floyd during all of my life, but their visible lacking of creativity have pissed me off, really.Roger Waters travelling all around the world, touring an album that came to light in 1979.Albums like Momentary Lapse, and Division Bell are too weak to say the least.Some day, when all the fans(fools) like us were dead, truly intelligent people will look back and laugh a lot at the extremely short Floyd catalogue(for sure).And is not the case of comparing it to a Johannes Brahms's catalogue, that is short, but has 100 absolute magnum opus of all universal's music history that is above the good and the bad(this would be extremely outrageous).In this case of Floyd's ridiculously short catalogue, and it is an extremely short one, with just five great(Masterpieces) albums, Meddle, The Dark Side of the Moon, Wish You Were Here, Animals(The best One), The Wall. Yes, you are right reviewer, and I understand completely your complain and intelligent arguments.I just can't stand anymore all this attempt in transforming Syd in a kind of divine being, mainly because we all know that they decided not catch him that day (Mainly Roger Waters), and they were very happy about this decision.Every time David Gilmour appears in public is pathetic, it is always to play one more boring version of either Comfortably Numb or Wish You Were Here, that we all fans can't stand no more.I 've been sincere here, stop doing more products with the only intention of fooling people. These DVD's of Floyd making of are pathetic to say the least.We fans deserve respect.The second best Rock And Roll band ever called Led Zeppelin, did the same number of albums in ten years of an amazing career(and only above average albums).The greatest one, called The Beatles(remember), same thing, in only eight years produced more than Floyd in decades of living in the past doing absolutely nothing.Come on guys, awake, look and see that this is turning into a ridiculous attitude.A band called Rush is still totally active, they have I think more than thirty amazing albums, the last one was released few months ago.Obviously we will see only ""negative votes"" here in this review, and this is exactly what I would expect, because fans ARE INCAPABLE OF THINKING WITH REASON!Take a look at all these useless immersion boxes of both ""Dark Side"", ""Wish You Were Here"", and ""The Wall"", the only intent is to get easy money and laugh.Who in this world would say that these boxes have either, something really new, or interesting?How many boxes with the same extremely too old works they are going to force down through our throats?Stop you all being fooled, just think and stop spending your money with the same old works indefinitely.The members of this group(Pink Floyd) I used to admire, are abusing the  condescension of their fans in a irresponsible way.And the majority of us, unfortunately, have refused to admit.If you don't like what I wrote, keep buying.These guys(Pink Floyd) are lazy.

As always, the arrangements are meticulous; Gilmore in particular is in fine form on the album.  The title track has what is probably his most copped acoustic riff as well as some of Waters' most poignant lyrics; the title track, which bookends the album, is a watershed mark for the band; it distills everything that is great about Pink Floyd: it's melodic, stark, epic, and completely original.  ""Welcome to the Machine"" and ""Have a Cigar"" are the remaining tunes, both of which seem to deal in one of the band's preoccupations at the time: the ridiculous of the music business.This documentary chronicles the writing and recording of the album.

1539590,A3KKM0T1KY42HA,B007X6ZRMA,Sky,"[4, 4]","What an amazing work Pink Floyd's 1975 album Wish You Were here is. I still remember opening the album and being surprised by what I saw:Side one1. ""Shine On You Crazy Diamond, Parts 1-5""2. ""Welcome to the Machine""Side two1. ""Have a Cigar""2. ""Wish You Were Here""3. ""Shine On You Crazy Diamond, Parts 6-9""I was like, ""What? 5 songs??? Two with the same name?"" Then I put it on my turntable, and I probably didn't take it of for several weeks. It was one of the most impressionable listens to an album I had ever experienced.This Blu Ray release is the story of the making of that album and includes some very interesting back-story on the Syd Barrett days...which of course makes sense because Syd was the Crazy Diamond. The DVD is beautifully produced and the 85 minute play time goes by in what seemed like 30 minutes. For me it seemed to end with so much more to see and tell. But that is the torture that is every Pink Floyd fan's greatest desire: To see these guys get together again and play a show (shows!!!). Unfortunately, Richard Wright's untimely departure in 2008 obviates any true hope of a full reunion; hence, for Syd, Richard and the fans...David, Roger and Nick need to get it together. But I digress....There are no full performances of any of the songs, so don't go in with that expectation. The Story of Wish You Were Here DVD is a documentary treat for any Pink Floyd fan. It's captivating to see these guys tell the story of the album during the current day, then flash back to the time period with video and stills of the time that the album was recorded, the time before it was recorded and bits of time in-between then and now.And I had no idea that the vocals on the song Have a Cigar are not those of Roger Waters (or any of the other band members).

First came the Discovery reissue. Then the Experience 2-CD set and Immersion (2-CD/2-DVD/Blu Ray) box set, the long awaited Hybrid SACD issue remixed by James Guthrie and and was re-released on 180 Gram Audiophile vinyl which sounded superb. Then finally, came this DVD documentary which looks at how the album was made.The three surviving band members being co-founder/singer/bass player/songwriter/lyricist Roger Waters, singer/guitarist/songwriter David Gilmour, co-founder/drummer Nick Mason are featured in new and exclusive interviews in this documentary plus comments from the late co-founder/keyboard player/songwriter/occasional singer Richard Wright from 2001. Roger and David also play songs and demonstrate themes from the album which its theme used the madness of Pink Floyd co-founder Syd Barrett as a symbol for the isolating alienation of the modern world, in particular the greed of the music business. David's superb reenactments of the album's centerpiece tribute to Syd Barrett ""Shine On You Crazy Diamond"" and Wish You Were Here's title cut and Roger's acoustic versions of ""Have a Cigar"", a countrified ""Wish You Were Here"" and ""Welcome to the Machine"" are stellar. The album's original recording and mixing engineer Brian Humphries sifts through the original multi-track tapes isolating some parts of songs to hear some parts isolated either on their own or not ever heard before. Also, there is concert footage from the band's performance at The Brighton Dome in Brighton, Sussex, England in June of 1972 plus some rare seen pictures of the band at Abbey Road from the recording sessions and animations from Gerald Scarfe which were used on the band's 1977 Tour when they played all of Wish You Were Here start to finish. Plus you get additional interviews with Gerald Scarfe, British journalist Nick Kent, the original 1967 era Pink Floyd producer Joe Boyd, the group's first manager Peter Jenner, photographer Jill Furmanovsky, backing singer Venetta Fields, British folk singer Roy Harper, album cover designer Storm Thorgerson, co-designer Aubrey Powell and the man who was set on fire on the album's cover Ronnie Rondell to flesh out this great documentary.There is 25 minutes of extra footage with more demonstrations from David playing ""Wish You Were Here"" and ""Shine On You Crazy Diamond"" in full, Roger playing his unplugged ""Wish You Were Here"" plus more interviews with Gilmour, Waters and Mason which didn't make the TV documentary due to time constraints.When I first saw the documentary online in May of 2012 (VH1 Classic showed twice and is more interested in That Metal Show and One Hit Wonder junk), I anxiously awaited the DVD and got the DVD yesterday and it is SUPERB!Highly recommended!",5,The definitive documentary on Pink Floyd's masterpiece,1341705600,"07 8, 2012",2012,3182,"['Pink', 'Floyd', 'Story', 'Wish', 'Were', 'Here', 'DVD', 'Blu-Ray', 'are', 'must', 'own', 'Pink', 'Floyd', 'fans.Using', 'template', 'famed', 'British', 'also', 'VH1', 'Classic', 'TV', 'series', 'called', 'Classic', 'Albums', 'been', 'many', 'years', 'company', 'show', 'Eagle', 'Rock', 'unleashed', 'March', '2012', 'documentary', 'Pink', 'Floyd', '1975', 'classic', 'Wish', 'Were', 'Here.Pink', 'Floyd', 'Wish', 'Were', 'Here', 'album', 'had', 'well', 'deserved', 'celebration', '2011/12', 'First', 'came', 'Discovery', 'reissue', 'Then', 'Experience', '2-CD', 'set', 'Immersion', '2-CD/2-DVD/Blu', 'Ray', 'box', 'set', 'long', 'awaited', 'Hybrid', 'SACD', 'issue', 'remixed', 'James', 'Guthrie', 'was', 're-released', '180', 'Gram', 'Audiophile', 'vinyl', 'sounded', 'superb', 'Then', 'finally', 'came', 'DVD', 'documentary', 'how', 'album', 'was', 'made.The', 'three', 'surviving', 'band', 'members', 'being', 'co-founder/singer/bass', 'player/songwriter/lyricist', 'Roger', 'Waters', 'singer/guitarist/songwriter', 'David', 'Gilmour', 'co-founder/drummer', 'Nick', 'Mason', 'are', 'featured', 'new', 'exclusive', 'interviews', 'documentary', 'comments', 'late', 'co-founder/keyboard', 'player/songwriter/occasional', 'singer', 'Richard', 'Wright', '2001', 'Roger', 'David', 'also', 'play', 'songs', 'demonstrate', 'themes', 'album', 'theme', 'used', 'madness', 'Pink', 'Floyd', 'co-founder', 'Syd', 'Barrett', 'symbol', 'isolating', 'alienation', 'modern', 'world', 'particular', 'greed', 'music', 'business', 'David', 'superb', 'reenactments', 'album', 'centerpiece', 'tribute', 'Syd', 'Barrett', 'Shine', 'Crazy', 'Diamond', 'Wish', 'Were', 'Here', 'title', 'cut', 'Roger', 'acoustic', 'versions', 'Have', 'Cigar', 'countrified', 'Wish', 'Were', 'Here', 'Welcome', 'Machine', 'are', 'stellar', 'album', 'original', 'recording', 'mixing', 'engineer', 'Brian', 'Humphries', 'original', 'multi-track', 'tapes', 'isolating', 'parts', 'songs', 'hear', 'parts', 'isolated', 'either', 'own', 'not', 'ever', 'heard', 'Also', 'concert', 'footage', 'band', 'performance', 'Brighton', 'Dome', 'Brighton', 'Sussex', 'England', 'June', '1972', 'rare', 'seen', 'pictures', 'band', 'Abbey', 'Road', 'recording', 'sessions', 'animations', 'Gerald', 'Scarfe', 'were', 'used', 'band', '1977', 'Tour', 'when', 'played', 'Wish', 'Were', 'Here', 'start', 'finish', 'get', 'additional', 'interviews', 'Gerald', 'Scarfe', 'British', 'journalist', 'Nick', 'Kent', 'original', '1967', 'era', 'Pink', 'Floyd', 'producer', 'Joe', 'Boyd', 'group', 'first', 'manager', 'Peter', 'Jenner', 'photographer', 'Jill', 'Furmanovsky', 'backing', 'singer', 'Venetta', 'Fields', 'British', 'folk', 'singer', 'Roy', 'Harper', 'album', 'cover', 'designer', 'Storm', 'Thorgerson', 'co-designer', 'Aubrey', 'Powell', 'man', 'who', 'was', 'set', 'fire', 'album', 'cover', 'Ronnie', 'Rondell', 'flesh', 'out', 'great', 'documentary.There', '25', 'minutes', 'extra', 'footage', 'more', 'demonstrations', 'David', 'playing', 'Wish', 'Were', 'Here', 'Shine', 'Crazy', 'Diamond', 'full', 'Roger', 'playing', 'unplugged', 'Wish', 'Were', 'Here', 'more', 'interviews', 'Gilmour', 'Waters', 'Mason', 'did', ""n't"", 'make', 'TV', 'documentary', 'due', 'time', 'constraints.When', 'first', 'saw', 'documentary', 'online', 'May', '2012', 'VH1', 'Classic', 'showed', 'twice', 'more', 'interested', 'Metal', 'Show', 'One', 'Hit', 'Wonder', 'junk', 'anxiously', 'awaited', 'DVD', 'got', 'DVD', 'yesterday', 'SUPERB', 'Highly', 'recommended']",N/A

However, you may be surprised and delighted by this truly superb documentary insight into the origin, creation and final editing of what many (including the surviving band members themselves) feel to be Floyd's most enduring album. The interviews with Gilmour, Waters and Mason are bang up-to-date, archive footage of the late Rick Wright talking about the project is also included as are vignettes from Roy Harper, sleeve designer Storm Thorgerson and stunt man Ronnie Rondell who was set on fire for the album artwork (nb this is before the days of sophisticated CGI and if you needed a convincing image of someone on fire you had to do it for real).The spectre at the feast is the late Syd Barrett, who passed away in July 2006 just a couple of years before Rick Wright succumbed to cancer and also left us. The original inspiration for Floyd and the early band leader, most fans know Barrett is the subject of both `Shine on...' and the album's title track. A cameo of Barrett's short artistic career is featured in the film. Out-of-the-blue, seven years after leaving the band he turned up in Abbey Road Studio whilst the band was recording SOYCD and at first, no-one recognised him with shaved head and a more rotund physique. The only known photo of Barrett from this period was taken on that day, at Abbey Road Studios. Was Barrett psychic and did he pick up on the project his former band were engaged in? It seems so.Some of the more interesting moments in the film explore how and why Roy Harper ended up recording the vocal track on `Have a Cigar' (which Waters later regretted, wishing he had sung the track himself) and the work put in by Thorgerson on the concept, design and realization of the album artwork.The editing is excellent, the interview material well chosen, the pacing just right.  Each moment is a gem; there's no fluff here.

1539599,A95A9XOSHTQKX,B007X6ZRMA,"YeahSoMaybe? ""computersandmusicperson""","[7, 20]","This video lowered my opinion of Pink Floyd.  I love Pink Floyd as much as the next guy. I own most of their albums:  Relics, Ummagumma, Meddle, Obscured by Clouds, Dark Side (SACD of course but prior to that wore out two vinyl copies, WYWH, The Wall yadda yadda...  I knew long ago the Syd Barrett story from various occasional trade articles.The ratio of talk to music or musical insight is way too high.The references to Syd seem to be crocodile tears a bit.  As I recall, at the time they parted ways with him, they were glad to be rid of him.  Now he's this abstract monument they can use to..I don't know...hang a concept on because they are out of ideas.The only thing I learned from this video is that Roy Harper sang Have a Cigar - which I have always considered the best song on the album.  I agree with another reviewer here:  Thank God he did! because Roger's and David's attempts to sing it are quite painful. It's movies like this that make me respect Grace Slick for proactively hanging it up.I will always have Pink Floyd in my record collection. (I think Meddle is the overlooked sleeper in their catalog).  I will play their albums and enjoy them when the mood strikes.  However: this video doesn't present them in a good light.UPDATE  3/1/2013:  I recently saw clips of ""Remember That Night"" by Gilmour and ordered it immediately.  It's a winner.  Echoes and Arnold Layne (with Bowie on guest vocals) are worth the price of admission alone.  If you don't already own that or the ""Live in Gdansk"" CD set by Gilmour, I suggest you would be MUCH better off buying either of those items.MAJOR REVISION UPDATE  3/30/2013:  I have removed a lot of my previous review. Reason:  I recently watched the 1 hour Howard Stern interview with Roger on YouTube and my heart melted towards Roger and it changed my perspective. Roger comes off as a very down to earth, kind and self-effacing guy.  He parries Mr. Stern's typical ongoing badgering rudeness with very thoughtful answers and keeps his sense of humor still...never losing his center.  Very smart, classy and understated guy.  No backstabbing comments of the band even when baited by H.S.  While I don't feel like Roger or any of the band come off well in * this * particular movie (The Story Of..) , I am revising my comments as the band has definitely paid their dues.  In closing, I love their music, I love the band.  I still don't feel this movie merits more than 2 stars as it tediously documents quite honestly some low points in the band's history - it's not something fun or memorable for me to watch.  I can't recommend the purchase of this movie, but I can recommend most of their past work.

I still listen to Pink Floyd CDs and DVDs and look forward to more blu-rays. If I can judge by the 70 reviews written so soon after the release of this documentary, there appears to be a large demand for more Pink Floyd blu-rays. How about releasing some of the early Pink Floyd recordings on blu-ray that most of us have forgotten and our children and grandchildren have never heard?A quick look at my CD rack finds The Pink Floyd Early Singles from 1992,with Arnold Layne, Careful With That Axe, Eugene and 8 more. The Piper at the Gates of Dawn from 1967 has 11 more songs that you have probably forgotten. Works has 10 songs from 1983. And then there is More, an original movie soundtrack produced by ""The Pink Floyd""(sic).What I would like to see is a documentary on blu-ray which features commentary about the older CDs (and I probably missed some of them). Blu-rays have five times the capacity of a DVD.Is anyone interested?",5,An Important Documentary About One of My Favorite Bands,1367971200,"05 8, 2013",2013,1051,"['remember', 'listening', 'Wall', 'late', 'night', 'FM', 'radio', 'incredibly', 'high', 'volume', 'when', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'studying', 'still', 'listen', 'Pink', 'Floyd', 'CDs', 'DVDs', 'look', 'forward', 'more', 'blu-rays', 'can', 'judge', '70', 'reviews', 'written', 'so', 'soon', 'release', 'documentary', 'be', 'large', 'demand', 'more', 'Pink', 'Floyd', 'blu-rays', 'How', 'releasing', 'early', 'Pink', 'Floyd', 'recordings', 'blu-ray', 'most', 'have', 'forgotten', 'children', 'grandchildren', 'have', 'never', 'heard', 'quick', 'look', 'CD', 'rack', 'Pink', 'Floyd', 'Early', 'Singles', '1992', 'Arnold', 'Layne', 'Careful', 'Axe', 'Eugene', '8', 'more', 'Piper', 'Gates', 'Dawn', '1967', '11', 'more', 'songs', 'have', 'probably', 'forgotten', 'Works', '10', 'songs', '1983', 'then', 'More', 'original', 'movie', 'soundtrack', 'produced', 'Pink', 'Floyd', 'sic', '.What', 'would', 'like', 'see', 'documentary', 'blu-ray', 'commentary', 'older', 'CDs', 'probably', 'missed', 'Blu-rays', 'have', 'five', 'times', 'capacity', 'DVD.Is', 'anyone', 'interested']",N/A
