1084406,A2582KMXLK2P06,B000RZGHR8,B. E Jackson,"[0, 0]","After stinks.  It tries *so* hard to win over viewers by simply focusing on fast-paced... events, and upbeat techno music to make it *seem* more exciting.  It's rare when this happens, but I was SO confused with the storyline that I'm convinced there weren't even any writers involved in the making of this movie.  You see it's about a few young people that seek thrilling situations in subway stations and on rooftops, but what do they actually *do*?  Nothing at all but run and jump around avoiding supposed danger!  Eventually it gets REALLY strange when these young people start disappearing before our very eyes.  That's right- one moment they're there, the next you see them flashing, and then they disappear.  WHAT THE HECK!?!?!?!  In one scene a man gets shot and then vanishes.That's all there is to this movie.  Running around, fast-paced techno songs to make the events seem important and interesting, the occasional running away from the ""bad guys"" (whoever they were- they looked like security guards) and that's it.

She likes quirky movies and kept waiting for this movie to make sense. At a certain point I could tell that it never would. She became stubborn and watched it until the end.The crap camera work and all the green lighting came me a headache.

This movie has two major flaws. One, the godawful camera work, and two, its predictability. I realized what was going on 30 minutes into it. I believe I speak for the majority when I say the shaky handheld camera ""effect"" has been played to death. It's no longer original or effective. It's annoying and nauseating and belongs only in death metal music videos. Apart from that, there are some major continuity issues and total lack of coherence that will drive you up the wall if you dare seriously think about it. All in all, this movie seemed like a desperate attempt to somehow fill 90 minutes of screen time. Don't repeat my mistake, save yourself some time and money and skip this one.",2,You've seen it all before...,1220832000,"09 8, 2008",2008,813,"['wanted', 'see', 'movie', 'subject', 'urban', 'exploration', 'fascinates', 'did', ""n't"", 'read', 'reviews', 'BAD', 'mistake', 'movie', 'two', 'major', 'flaws', 'One', 'godawful', 'camera', 'work', 'two', 'predictability', 'realized', 'what', 'was', 'going', '30', 'minutes', 'believe', 'speak', 'majority', 'when', 'say', 'shaky', 'handheld', 'camera', 'effect', 'been', 'played', 'death', 'no', 'longer', 'original', 'effective', 'annoying', 'nauseating', 'belongs', 'only', 'death', 'metal', 'music', 'videos', 'Apart', 'are', 'major', 'continuity', 'issues', 'total', 'lack', 'coherence', 'will', 'drive', 'up', 'wall', 'dare', 'seriously', 'think', 'movie', 'seemed', 'desperate', 'attempt', 'somehow', 'fill', '90', 'minutes', 'screen', 'time', 'Do', ""n't"", 'repeat', 'mistake', 'save', 'time', 'money', 'skip', 'one']",After...

I do not want to say anything to spoil the movie in case you have not watched it yet. I will say that it was hard to follow until the end when it all comes together. Unfortunately, by that time, it was too late. The whole time you are watching this movie, you are scratching your head just trying to figure it out and when you do figure it out, it just leaves you with an unsatisfied feeling.

Even worse, when the camera is not shaky and trailing they use another gimic and the shots are over solarised and washed out to the point of invisible.Plot and premise were interesting enough. Location innovative. No matter these virtues were completely overridden by the stupid production gimicks.I found it practically unwatchable. I can't remember when a movie last annoyed me quite this much.If I could bother to remember the director and cameraman's names I would be sure to boycott them forever going forward.Flora Montgomery should shoot her agent.
