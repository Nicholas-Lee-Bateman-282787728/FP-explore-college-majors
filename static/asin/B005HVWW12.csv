1461326,A30JPZ9TZ7I61U,B005HVWW12,"Christopher Barrett ""Evil Corgi""","[12, 12]","Before bashing not helpful, hear me out.  I watch dozens of anime series each year and I love to buy the cheaper SAVE sets.  I loved Ghost Hunt, D Gray Man, Hellsing, and many other Occult themed anime series.  I also enjoy cutesey series such as Azumanga Daioh.  So you would think 1 + 1 = 2 yes?  Well it's more like 1 x 1 = 1.  The series is neither great as a cute vampire cat girl series or great as a serious Occult series.Since the show switches from cute to serious so frequently, the viewer is often unable to really get a grasp of the tension or the comedy.  It's like someone showing you a picture of a dead body, then removing the picture and telling you an unrelated joke.  The other big issue I had was with the Dragon Ball style fighting between the Exorcists and the demons.  If you watch Ghost Hunt, the exorcisms are all carried out very well (until the last episode), no flying balls of exorcist fire or things like that.  Now don't get me wrong, that would be okay, but the show doesn't really seem to play well to that kind of action.  It gets hokey very quickly.If you can watch through and enjoy the first three episodes, then it's worth buying.  Even if you are like me, and not completely impressed, $17 is not a lot of expense for 24 episodes.  You can watch them on Funimation's website for free (with commercials), so you might check out the first few.  I do recommend the Japanese audio track, though the dub is actually pretty good.  The subtitles annoy me since they don't match up neatly to the Japanese dialogue.  But only an issue because I know enough Japanese to get myself in trouble.  They do not have closed captions for the English dub.Overall the series is cute, decently enjoyable, well animated, but just uneven.  If it had been more of a cute show without the intense Dragon Ball Z fighting, then I would have rated 4 stars.  I never really got to just relax into the series.I recommend D Gray Man, Hellsing, xxxHolic, and Ghost Hunt for Occult themed series.For something cute/serious check out Melancholy of Haruhi Suziyama.For just silly cuteness check out Azumanga Daioh or School Rumble.",3,A cute but uneven series ~,1346889600,"09 6, 2012",2012,2136,"['bashing', 'not', 'helpful', 'hear', 'watch', 'dozens', 'anime', 'series', 'year', 'love', 'buy', 'cheaper', 'SAVE', 'sets', 'loved', 'Ghost', 'Hunt', 'D', 'Gray', 'Man', 'Hellsing', 'many', 'other', 'Occult', 'themed', 'anime', 'series', 'also', 'enjoy', 'cutesey', 'series', 'such', 'Azumanga', 'Daioh', 'would', 'think', '1', '1', '=', '2', 'yes', 'Well', 'more', '1', '1', '=', '1', 'series', 'neither', 'great', 'cute', 'vampire', 'cat', 'girl', 'series', 'great', 'serious', 'Occult', 'series.Since', 'show', 'cute', 'serious', 'so', 'frequently', 'viewer', 'often', 'unable', 'really', 'get', 'grasp', 'tension', 'comedy', 'someone', 'showing', 'picture', 'dead', 'body', 'then', 'removing', 'picture', 'telling', 'unrelated', 'joke', 'other', 'big', 'issue', 'had', 'was', 'Dragon', 'Ball', 'style', 'fighting', 'Exorcists', 'demons', 'watch', 'Ghost', 'Hunt', 'exorcisms', 'are', 'carried', 'out', 'very', 'well', 'last', 'episode', 'flying', 'balls', 'exorcist', 'fire', 'things', 'Now', 'do', ""n't"", 'get', 'wrong', 'would', 'be', 'okay', 'show', ""n't"", 'really', 'seem', 'play', 'well', 'kind', 'action', 'hokey', 'very', 'quickly.If', 'can', 'watch', 'enjoy', 'first', 'three', 'episodes', 'then', 'worth', 'buying', 'Even', 'are', 'not', 'completely', 'impressed', '17', 'not', 'lot', 'expense', '24', 'episodes', 'can', 'watch', 'Funimation', 'website', 'free', 'commercials', 'might', 'check', 'out', 'first', 'few', 'do', 'recommend', 'Japanese', 'audio', 'track', 'dub', 'actually', 'pretty', 'good', 'subtitles', 'do', ""n't"", 'match', 'up', 'neatly', 'Japanese', 'dialogue', 'only', 'issue', 'know', 'enough', 'Japanese', 'get', 'trouble', 'do', 'not', 'have', 'closed', 'captions', 'English', 'dub.Overall', 'series', 'cute', 'decently', 'enjoyable', 'well', 'animated', 'just', 'uneven', 'had', 'been', 'more', 'cute', 'show', 'intense', 'Dragon', 'Ball', 'Z', 'fighting', 'then', 'would', 'have', 'rated', '4', 'stars', 'never', 'really', 'got', 'just', 'relax', 'series.I', 'recommend', 'D', 'Gray', 'Man', 'Hellsing', 'xxxHolic', 'Ghost', 'Hunt', 'Occult', 'themed', 'series.For', 'something', 'cute/serious', 'check', 'Melancholy', 'Haruhi', 'Suziyama.For', 'just', 'silly', 'cuteness', 'check', 'out', 'Azumanga', 'Daioh', 'School', 'Rumble']",Moon Phase: The Complete Collection
