865616,A328S9RN3U5M68,B0006FFRR0,Grady Harp,"[12, 13]","SHADOW OF FEAR has all the markings of one of those scary French suspense films - evil begets evil in a centrifuge of action and mind manipulation.  For first time writers and director this is an interesting concept that unfortunately ends with a too pat resolution.After opening credits play over moody and very well photographed shoes walking on a rainy pavement bleeding into a hand held glass of liquor, we are plunged into an event of a hit and run by one Harrison French (Matthew Davis) only to discover that this youngest member of a secret society of wealthy men controlled by William Ashbury (James Spader) at first tries to keep his murderous event to himself without involving his wife Wynn (Robin Tunney) or his associates.  French deals in real estate and is on the verge of bankruptcy and is dependent on his father-in-law  Congressman (Peter Coyote) who strangely warns him to move away from the present environs.Events develop: French's dope addict brother-in-law is killed after being involved in a bank heist (is this the man French murdered by hit and run?), French is arrested by Detective (Aidan Quinn) who seems to have all of the information about the interweaving scandalous events captured on film but one of French's associates in the society (an associate on the brink of being discovered as womanizer and adulterer), and the very cool and omniscient William Ashbury consistently intervenes to correct each of the evil doings of the secret society - for a price.  Money can apparently change all truths and the entire secret society is implicated in some way with odious misdeeds covered up by the evil manipulations of Ashbury.How all of these interwoven missteps are resolved is left to the very end of the film and therein lies the film's weakness.  Too many loose threads are flimsily tied together by a few pertinent deaths and the story simply ends.  Up to this point the tension is high and the characters all are well played by a fine cast (especially James Spader), the cinematography is moody and elegant and the musical score heightens the tension and atmosphere.  For the first three fourths of this film we are suspended in a bizarre world of shadows and human deceit that could have had much more punch with a better resolved denouement.  Still, a good film for a rainy evening suspense addict!

Interesting how a corpse laying in the woods for at least 3 days looks so good - just one of my gripes i suppose . The only endearing feature of this movie was the fact the a very good actors like Matt Davis & Jmes Spader were in the movie - take away the eye candy and you don't have much left - rent it - don't buy it !Oh - yeah - what a small town they must have lived in - so many coincidences and chance meetings - maybe that was to make the story more believable - who knows !",3,Saved by Matt Davis,1110153600,"03 7, 2005",2005,827,"['Sounded', 'good', 'story', 'i', 'suppose', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'characters', 'had', 'acted', 'most', 'normal', 'people', 'discussed', 'what', 'was', 'happening', 'friends', 'loved', 'ones', 'once', 'again', 'hero', 'piece', 'case', 'Harrison', 'French', 'Matt', 'Davis', 'do', 'what', 'nobody', 'real', 'life', 'woud', 'do', 'go', 'alone', 'odds', 'Interesting', 'how', 'corpse', 'laying', 'woods', 'least', '3', 'days', 'so', 'good', 'just', 'one', 'gripes', 'i', 'suppose', 'only', 'endearing', 'feature', 'movie', 'was', 'fact', 'very', 'good', 'actors', 'Matt', 'Davis', 'Jmes', 'Spader', 'were', 'movie', 'take', 'away', 'eye', 'candy', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'much', 'left', 'rent', 'do', ""n't"", 'buy', 'Oh', 'yeah', 'what', 'small', 'town', 'must', 'have', 'lived', 'so', 'many', 'coincidences', 'chance', 'meetings', 'maybe', 'was', 'make', 'story', 'more', 'believable', 'who']",N/A
865619,A3LZGLA88K0LA0,B0006FFRR0,Michael Butts,"[4, 4]","While starting out with an interesting premise and maintaining its ominous, what is he going to do mood, SHADOW OF FEAR loses this edge when it brings out an ambiguous ending that leaves the viewer wondering where the movie has taken you.  Matt Davis (Below) plays an up and coming real estate fellow who loses a big account.  On the way home from a meeting with a group of high powered men, he hits a pedestrian and panicking, he hides the body.  Davis does a good job in his role, lending his innocent physical appearance and his overwhelming sense of helplessness to the film's foundation.  Robin Tunney as his wife also does well.  Davis does find himself in deep doodoo though when James Spader's malevolent William Ashbury offers to help him ""cover up"" his deed.  Seems like Ashbury has done this before for the other gentlemen in their Tuesdy night club.  Spader underplays his character nicely, but never lets up on his simmering evil.  Aidan Quinn plays a detective with his own checkered past, and the gentlemen in the club include notable character actors Peter Coyote and David Selby.

Finally,in maybe the last ten minutes or soof the film, everything is unleashedat once and you're left to process allthe information that would have beencommon knowledge in a real life situation.The plot is mildy far fetched and once all thedots were connected, I was still left thinking,""Um, what the hell....?""Anyway, I like and recommend the movie, mostly because of Mr.Ashbury's smooth, cold demeanor.

A young couple who seem to be very much in love and are going through the normal growing pains of life.  Harrison has been dependent upon his father-in-law to help pay for their home until he becomes stronger in the business.  Losing an account one evening he is driving home, quite upset and hits and kills a man. This happening sets into action the entire premise of the movie.We find out that all the men are involved in a secret organigation, however not by choice.  It seems each has done a deed they had to cover up and a very evil man named William found the solutions, however now they would forever be in his debt.  Harrison is now in the web, having run from the scene of the accident.However he decides to fight back and get his life and those of the men free from this demonic controlling man.There are many twists and turns to this movie but I think it really showed that owning up to what we have done is the best route to take.  Deception in any form only leads to more heartache and control by forces we do not want to take over. This movie had a good ending, but you wonder how many times in life that people have put themselves in these situations that it did not.
