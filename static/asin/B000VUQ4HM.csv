I really liked the the English dubbed better than the Japanese language version. I mean in the English dubbed version, they make all this humorous sounds and silly pharses, as well as replaying almost everybodies screw ups. Then there's the Japanese version. They don't make good enough jokes or make the best communtary, but it's still fun to watch. I personally recommend buying this one to anyones collection, if your a diehard gameshow fan, this one is a must buy.",5,MXC anyone?,1218931200,"08 17, 2008",2008,577,"['Probably', 'one', 'greatest', 'shows', 'time', 'got', 'be', 'MXC', 'just', 'love', 'watching', 'show', 'show', 'really', 'liked', 'English', 'dubbed', 'better', 'Japanese', 'language', 'version', 'mean', 'English', 'dubbed', 'version', 'make', 'humorous', 'sounds', 'silly', 'pharses', 'as', 'well', 'replaying', 'almost', 'everybodies', 'screw', 'ups', 'Then', 'Japanese', 'version', 'do', ""n't"", 'make', 'good', 'enough', 'jokes', 'make', 'best', 'communtary', 'still', 'fun', 'watch', 'personally', 'recommend', 'buying', 'one', 'anyones', 'collection', 'diehard', 'gameshow', 'fan', 'one', 'must', 'buy']",N/A
