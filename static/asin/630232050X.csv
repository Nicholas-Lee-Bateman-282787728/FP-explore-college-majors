Brings back a lot of fond memories for me.

307989,A2X25C107CSLOR,630232050X,"Peter Shelley ""petershelley""","[2, 8]","This documentary on the Republic movie studio reveals that they released few classics, or if they did, they aren't mentioned here. Republic was only  a small operation formed in 1935 yet it managed to stay productive until  1959 when it was wiped out by the advent of TV. It thrived in the 30's and  40's when it's major output was weekly serials featuring Dick Tracy and The  Lone Ranger, and westerns starring singing cowboys like Gene Autry and Roy  Rogers. These films were indicative of the studio's limitations since they  were made on a shoe-string budget, generally with time for only one take.  The pompous narrator, who sounds like he's calling a baseball game, tells  us that because of their success, the studio was able to create minatures  that &quot;the major studios envied&quot;. Hmm. Since a film could be made  so easily it allowed for experimentation and also tended to attract people  who no-one else wanted. Republic promoted the bumpkin Judy Canova and other  obscure vaudeville performers, gave a career to Czech ice skater Vera Hruba  Ralston, and dabbled in propaganda pieces like The Red Menace. Orson Welles  made a black and white Macbeth in 1948 which the studio spent months  re-dubbing since he had insisted on authentic Scottish accents, which they  found to be inaudible. Nicholas Ray directed Joan Crawford in the  sado-masochistic  Johnny Guitar in 1954. John Wayne made 33 films at  Republic, including John Ford's The Quiet Man, which is shown in lush  colour.  This documentary is perverse in the way it tends to skip over  known titles and performers and dwell on the little known. Uncovering  material is one thing, but giving undue attention to mediocrity is quite  another.",3,Of cult interest,960768000,"06 12, 2000",2000,1716,"['documentary', 'Republic', 'movie', 'studio', 'reveals', 'released', 'few', 'classics', 'did', 'are', ""n't"", 'mentioned', 'here', 'Republic', 'was', 'only', 'small', 'operation', 'formed', '1935', 'managed', 'stay', 'productive', '1959', 'when', 'was', 'wiped', 'out', 'advent', 'TV', 'thrived', '30', '40', 'when', 'major', 'output', 'was', 'weekly', 'serials', 'featuring', 'Dick', 'Tracy', 'Lone', 'Ranger', 'starring', 'singing', 'cowboys', 'Gene', 'Autry', 'Roy', 'Rogers', 'films', 'were', 'indicative', 'studio', 'limitations', 'were', 'made', 'shoe-string', 'budget', 'generally', 'time', 'only', 'one', 'take', 'pompous', 'narrator', 'who', 'calling', 'baseball', 'game', 'success', 'studio', 'was', 'able', 'create', 'minatures', 'quot', 'major', 'studios', 'envied', 'quot', 'Hmm', 'film', 'could', 'be', 'made', 'so', 'easily', 'allowed', 'experimentation', 'also', 'tended', 'attract', 'people', 'who', 'no-one', 'else', 'wanted', 'Republic', 'promoted', 'bumpkin', 'Judy', 'Canova', 'other', 'obscure', 'vaudeville', 'performers', 'gave', 'career', 'Czech', 'ice', 'skater', 'Vera', 'Hruba', 'Ralston', 'dabbled', 'propaganda', 'pieces', 'Red', 'Menace', 'Orson', 'Welles', 'made', 'black', 'white', 'Macbeth', '1948', 'studio', 'spent', 'months', 're-dubbing', 'had', 'insisted', 'authentic', 'Scottish', 'accents', 'found', 'be', 'inaudible', 'Ray', 'directed', 'Joan', 'Crawford', 'sado-masochistic', 'Johnny', 'Guitar', '1954', 'John', 'Wayne', 'made', '33', 'films', 'Republic', 'including', 'John', 'Ford', 'Quiet', 'Man', 'shown', 'lush', 'colour', 'documentary', 'perverse', 'way', 'skip', 'over', 'known', 'titles', 'performers', 'dwell', 'little', 'known', 'Uncovering', 'material', 'one', 'thing', 'giving', 'undue', 'attention', 'mediocrity', 'quite']",Republic Pictures Story VHS
