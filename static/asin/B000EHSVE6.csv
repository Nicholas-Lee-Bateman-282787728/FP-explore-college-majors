If you have been watching since season 1, the characters by the time you get to this season, are all good friends welcomed into your home....I grew up watching MASH on TV, and recall even when the new episodes were common place, that the local TV station would play 2 hours straight of MASH starting at 10:00 P.M.

I have such a crush on Alan Alda, and a yearning to be close them all the time.  This is what makes this collection so dear to my heart.  They are funny, and always make me laugh,  no matter what mood I am in.  BUT, they are heartbreakingly true about the horrors of war.  These Doctors, nurses and staff, all faced Hell,  and yet stuck it out to help all the fallen Victims.  Not just the soldiers, but citizens of Korea who were suffering and in the middle of it all.  The Doctors who faced death everyday themselves to patch up the young brave men, and then having to send them back into the waiting arms of terror.  Alda was Superb as the dedicated Doctor who helped all he met, even though he hated the war with every breath he took.  Now that we are at war again,  I feel everyone should see this.  You will realize that we [mostly] hate war, but do support the young men and women who are putting this lives in real danger to protect us all.  They were the true Heroes, those who actually fought or helped repair our soldiers bodies and sometimes their minds too, and all the soldiers, who came home missing limbs and part of the Souls,  and to those who never made it home.

Corporal Max Klinger has shed his dresses and pursuit of the ""Section Eight"" discharge after taking over as company clerk, and although Klinger is still a great and interesting character (and featured in more storylines this season), the show as a whole suffers without the sweet and innocent perspective of Radar.Hawkeye is more different than his gradual progression from the other nine seasons combined.  The early Hawkeye is the uncontested King of the surgeons as well as an incorrigible ladies man.

A Holy Mess (2/1/82)An AWOL soldier, Nick Gillis, seeks sanctuary in the mess tent, after Father Mulcahy's service.

Then the 4077th team hear the Marines have got a ""ringer"" in their team after pulling some strings.....

973374,AEKJ8G550YYW2,B000EHSVE6,"Randall Banks ""Music and Movie buff.""","[30, 35]","Possibly the biggest change of the last seasons was the number of subplots that got intertwined in each episode. Many of the episodes had up to four by Season 10. This, again, didn't take anything away from the show at all. After numerous cast member changes, all of them major, nothing but time could stop M*A*S*H(That's Show Biz) (1hr. Show).  A traveling U.S.O show brings many vignettes to our friends at the 4077th. Klinger meets his hero, a very corny comedian who happens to be the group's manager, and emcee. Charles finds his music biases tested when an according player goes over to the piano and impresses him. A woman on the tour seeks a pair of ballet shoes that her brother carried. The best part, thought, is that Father Mulcahy identifies a stripper on the group.(Identity Crisis) A soldier wants out, so badly that he swaps dog tags with a buddy of his who died in a battle. An insurance man is driving every nuts, except Potter, who bought some. Lastly, a patient gets a Dear John letter, with a request to return her picture. Hawkeye and Margaret come up with a great solution.(Rumor At The top) Klinger hears that a visiting officer is trying to find a new crew for a MASH. Nobody wants to go, until Hawkeye and B.J Change the rumor to a cushy job to Charles, who goes over the top with the visitor. Classic.(Give 'Em Hell Hawkeye) - A visiting supply man will give the camp what they need if they beautify the camp. Everyone thinks it's crazy, but they create a small park. This is all desribed in a letter, written to Harry Truman, by Hawkeye.(Wheelers and Dealers) Potter goes back to driving School at the behest of Klinger who convinces him not to just ""Pencil whip"" it out. A letter from home makes B.J reckless at Poker, and then at the pinball machine in the Officer's Club. He also gets mad at Hawkeye for not understanding why he's upset because his wife had to take a job as a waitress. He gets brought back to earth by Margaret. ""Maybe you have the most. But it's only because you have the most!"" She then turns and heads out of the officers club.  B.J comes into the Mess Tent and offers a peace offering to Charles, Hawkeye, Margaret and Mulcahy.(Communication Breakdown) Second class mail is being rerouted due to a snafu. Everyone is antsy due an impending marriage in the Li'l Abner comic. Charles, however, has newspapers sent from home. He gets everyone angry with him when he hoards them from everyone when his secret is let out. This leads to a rather contemptuous battle with the camp and Charles trading barbs. Two Korean brothers are re-united by Hawkeye. One was sent to North Korea, and the other to South Korea, so make sure that the family would be on the winning side.(Snap Judgment, Snappier Judgment) A gift from a family of a Polaroid gives Klinger a serious problem. After it's stolen Klinger gets it back from the black market, is caught with it, and is finally freed from charges by Hawkeye and B.J who found what really happened.(Twas the Day After Christmas)  On an extremely cold Christmas Potter thinks of following a British tradition by having the officers trade with the enlisted men. Charles gets very bristled at the whole idea, so Potter does it. Hawkeye is changing sheets, Charles is in the kitchen with Margaret, and Klinger ends up in command. Great moments, and a time when people realize that things are tough all around.(Follies Of The Living - concerns Of The Dead) Klinger, dissolutioned by a fever, carries on a conversation with a soldier who has died. The dead soldier is in denial of his death despite following Mulcahy as he goes through his stuff with B.J, sits while a buddy talks about him to Hawkeye. Margaret, meanwhile, is trying to tell eveyone what the problem is, and they won't listen.(Birthday Girls, The) Margaret wants to go to Tokyo, for her birthday. She gets Klinger to promise take her. Potter, however, almost ruins her day. A lecture must be given by at least a major. She convinces Charles to do the lecture. Meanwhile, as time to go approches, Klinger is scuttling about trying to raise money in a pool on the birth of a cow that came into camp. Margaret and Klinger don't make it to Tokyo, and Charles ends up helping the birth of the cow.(Blood and Guts)  An infamous reporter comes to MASH with pints of blood from people who write to him. His first patient was delivering food on a motorcycle, an Indian Scout. He makes it seem that the guy was being a Hero. B.J, with the reporter and Kinger's help rebuilds the Indian Scout.(A Holy Mess) A solider, who despretaly wants to get out of the army, seeks refuge with Father Mulcahy. A farmer, grateful for the military's help, has given a shipment of eggs to the unit.(The Tooth Shall Set You Free) Charles tries, to no avail, to hide his tooth ache. He takes medicine meant for patients, eats mashed potatoes, and is surly with everyone. Potter, B.J, and Hawkeye help oust a Major with an inordinate number of black casualties.(Pressure Points) A slip-up in O.R causes Potter to have serious issues with his abilities. He calls in Sydney, who helps, as usual. Charles, B.J, and Hawkeye wreck the swamp. Potter comes in, and just let's them go.(Where There's a Will, There's a War) With B.J on leave to get groomed, Hawkeye ends up going to the front to replace a dead doctor. Under heavy artillery fire, Hawkeye writes his will. Among the gifts he give out, his Hawaain shirt, Groucho glasses, and a nickel to Father Mulcahy.(Promotion Commotion) Potter names Hawkeye, B.J, and Charles to the Promotion committee. This causes Charles pains. A soldier, a large soldier well played by former football star John Matusak, threatens his life if he's not promoted. Klinger is in full uniform, and gives crisp salutes, and generally acts 100% like a soldier.(Heroes) The arrival of a prized boxer, who happens to be Father Mulcahy's hero, launches Hawkeye into the light of the camera, as the press invades the camp after the boxer suffers a serious stroke.(Sons and Bowlers) The episode opens with the Marines drinking homage to the 4077th, who just got creamed at softball. Klinger says ""They're just lucky there's not a bowling alley around. I'd show them a thing or two."" Potter comes up with a bowling alley. Meanwhile Hawkeye finds that his father is in the hospital for surgery. His father had written him two weeks earlier, but the mail delay caused the letter to get to him until the day. He tries for a long time to get a hold of his father. Finally, an operator gets the call through.(Picture This) Potter, painting a picture of the doctors, Margaret, and Klinger, causes severe stress. Everyone is yelling at someone, or mulitple someones, for multiple reasons. Potter gets the painting started by splitting everyone up to cut down on the fighting. This works fine until he tries to get everyone together to finish the painting. Everything comes to a head and everyone is yelling at eachother at once.(That Darn Kid) The arrival of a goat makes Klinger see dollar signs, selling goats milk. Hawkeye is made paymaster just as wounded arrive at the unit. The goat eats the money, leaving Hawkeye owing nearly a year's salary.M*A*S*H was one of those rare shows that didn't have a weak season. In a previous review I'd mentioned that the later years got a bit weaker. I was wrong. The release of M*A*S*H on D.V.D means that we see them in order. I was so used to the way that they'd mix the episodes up in syndication, so it's hard to see the good ones from the fair ones.",5,Once Again.

LeBaron ""Todd LeBaron""","[46, 50]","I've been through the discussion with a few friends about early M*A*S*H vs later M*A*S*H episodes...some folks insist that after Henry and Trapper left the series that it got too heavy-handed and lost its direction. I disagree with that, I feel the show in its early years was no doubt some of the finest comedy on the tube, with a great ensemble cast that worked well together. Well, the realities of war and of doing a long running series are that people come and people go. Certainly the fabric of the show changed over the years but I think the ensemble got even tighter as a result of those changes and the stories had more heart and less slapstick. As funny as Mclean Stevenson was as Col. Blake, Harry Morgan filled some tough shoes with style as the no-nonsense-but-all-heart Col. Potter. The final two seasons of M*A*S*H were described by Alan Alda as being stories written as a result of not wanting to repeat things they'd done before. We get more insight into the individual personalities of the staff (one of the more touching and well-done examples of this is when Winchester has to tell a concert pianist that his right hand won't be as useful as it once was and ultimately proves to him that he still has the gift of music as long as he doesn't let his circumstances silence it). I think it's to the credit of M*A*S*H that it did change and grow over the years...and there are plenty of fine examples of that in season ten and eleven.
