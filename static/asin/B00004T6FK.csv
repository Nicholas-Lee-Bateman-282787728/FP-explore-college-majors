550151,AQ8DU6XVA3USJ,B00004T6FK,"Alejandra Vernon ""artist & illustrator""","[5, 5]","These yoga exercises are so fast moving that one would have to just watch the video 2 or 3 times to get a handle on what is going on before being able to do all the poses with any expertise. I also found the moves done so quickly that I wasn't able to get my mind at the level of serenity I enjoy when doing yoga.Some of the poses are very difficult, and even Suzanne Deason looks a little wobbly in one of the ""Triangle"" variations, so you know it must be hard, because Deason is like a cross between stretchy elastic and strong iron.There is a cautionary notice at the beginning that says ""not all exercises are suitable for everyone"", and that might include anyone with creaky knees, for doing the lunges for instance, and those little ""jump"" movements Deason does with ease.If you are in marvelous condition, and like your yoga done in sequences that move like a rapidly flowing stream, you will like this tape, and I'm sure it will develop the strength and flexibility it claims to produce.Beginners should not purchase this tape...it will be very discouraging, and there will be few poses that they will be able to do with confidence and competence.I'm giving this a lower rating for being what I consider mislabeled; with my knees, I would never attempt yoga beyond the beginner level, and would not have bought this had it been labeled Intermediate, which it is, at the very least.The scenery is marvelous, of a volcanic landscape of Maui, and the end of the tape includes ""modifications"" to make the poses easier, by using a block or strap to make the stretches less of a stretch, but I can't imagine how one would deal with the accessories considering the poses are done so quickly.",3,"more like ""Intermediate"" !",1103760000,"12 23, 2004",2004,1692,"['yoga', 'exercises', 'are', 'so', 'fast', 'moving', 'one', 'would', 'have', 'just', 'watch', 'video', '2', '3', 'times', 'get', 'handle', 'what', 'going', 'being', 'able', 'do', 'poses', 'expertise', 'also', 'found', 'moves', 'done', 'so', 'quickly', 'was', ""n't"", 'able', 'get', 'mind', 'level', 'serenity', 'enjoy', 'when', 'doing', 'yoga.Some', 'poses', 'are', 'very', 'difficult', 'even', 'Suzanne', 'Deason', 'little', 'wobbly', 'one', 'Triangle', 'variations', 'know', 'must', 'be', 'hard', 'Deason', 'cross', 'stretchy', 'elastic', 'strong', 'iron.There', 'cautionary', 'notice', 'beginning', 'not', 'exercises', 'are', 'suitable', 'everyone', 'might', 'include', 'anyone', 'creaky', 'knees', 'doing', 'lunges', 'instance', 'little', 'jump', 'movements', 'Deason', 'ease.If', 'are', 'marvelous', 'condition', 'yoga', 'done', 'sequences', 'move', 'rapidly', 'flowing', 'stream', 'will', 'like', 'tape', ""'m"", 'sure', 'will', 'develop', 'strength', 'flexibility', 'produce.Beginners', 'should', 'not', 'purchase', 'tape', 'will', 'be', 'very', 'discouraging', 'will', 'be', 'few', 'poses', 'will', 'be', 'able', 'do', 'confidence', 'competence.I', ""'m"", 'giving', 'lower', 'rating', 'being', 'what', 'consider', 'mislabeled', 'knees', 'would', 'never', 'attempt', 'yoga', 'beginner', 'level', 'would', 'not', 'have', 'bought', 'had', 'been', 'labeled', 'Intermediate', 'very', 'least.The', 'scenery', 'marvelous', 'volcanic', 'landscape', 'Maui', 'end', 'tape', 'modifications', 'make', 'poses', 'easier', 'using', 'block', 'strap', 'make', 'stretches', 'less', 'stretch', 'ca', ""n't"", 'imagine', 'how', 'one', 'would', 'deal', 'accessories', 'considering', 'poses', 'are', 'done', 'so', 'quickly']",Lower Body Yoga for Beginners VHS
550152,A1CNNWWDBNUF0F,B00004T6FK,"""amazonchicken""","[17, 17]","As a recent fan of the Living Yoga for Beginners series, I can't praise these tapes enough! I have instantly become a yoga addict with these tapes, and now, with Lower Body Yoga for Beginners, I can have the benefits of this age old exercise targeted at specific areas of the body. I always use this tape after my lower body workout, and the results continue to amaze me!Yoga teacher Suzanne Deason (really, an amazing teacher with INCERDIBLE stamina!), takes you through a 4 minute warm up, a 14 minute active workout (ACTIVE being the operative word!), and finally a 2 minute deep relaxation. She performs the workout with remarkable control and strong, fluid movements on the crater of the Haleakala volcano on Maui - truely inspiring! The one great thing about these tapes is always the scenery!Things about this tape I found to be slightly different from the other Living Yoga series I've seen so far:- The pace is a little faster than I expected. You certainly work up a sweat performing these movements, but for whatever reason I seem to maintain a good level of relaxation and concentration.- The modifications for beginners and those who are less flexible are at the END of the tape, as opposed to being demonstrated DURING the specific movements. It could pose a problem to those who are totally unfamiliar with possible yoga modifications, but once you see them they are pretty simple to remember.- Although this tape is for the lower body, you need some pretty decent abdominal stregnth, balance (some of the moves involve balancing on one foot), and concentration. It's not something that will make the whole workout too challenging for a beginner, but it may not be for everyone. With time, however, these elements will become easier and just eventually end up a routine part of the workout. I would suggest to those a little discouraged by these elements to keep at it, once you get there the results are really quite amazing!All in all this tape most definately provides results, and FAST! As always, Living Yoga suggests that you view the entire tape before getting down onto the yoga mat and working out. The pace of this tape, upon first viewing, may seem too challenging for most beginners, and I must admit that I too was intimidated upon watching it the first time. In fact I tossed it on my shelf for a few days, gathered up my courage, and THEN gave it a try. It's not HALF as intimidating as it looks, and although fast-paced, I manage to maintain a good level of relaxation and inner peace.Over all, I would reccommend this to anyone interested in yoga, or anyone who wants to elaborate on their lower body workouts. Unlike the A.M. / P.M. series, which I would reccommend to just about everyone I know, this is more for someone a little more 'hard core on the yoga-train', or possibly someone who's into working out on a regular basis.",5,"Hard for beginners, but the results are QUICK!",994377600,"07 6, 2001",2001,2862,"['recent', 'fan', 'Living', 'Yoga', 'Beginners', 'series', 'ca', ""n't"", 'praise', 'tapes', 'enough', 'have', 'instantly', 'become', 'yoga', 'addict', 'tapes', 'now', 'Lower', 'Body', 'Yoga', 'Beginners', 'can', 'have', 'benefits', 'age', 'old', 'exercise', 'targeted', 'specific', 'areas', 'body', 'always', 'use', 'tape', 'lower', 'body', 'workout', 'results', 'continue', 'amaze', 'Yoga', 'Suzanne', 'Deason', 'really', 'amazing', 'teacher', 'INCERDIBLE', 'stamina', '4', 'minute', 'warm', 'up', '14', 'minute', 'active', 'workout', 'ACTIVE', 'being', 'operative', 'word', 'finally', '2', 'minute', 'deep', 'relaxation', 'workout', 'remarkable', 'control', 'strong', 'fluid', 'movements', 'crater', 'Haleakala', 'volcano', 'Maui', 'truely', 'inspiring', 'one', 'great', 'thing', 'tapes', 'always', 'scenery', 'Things', 'tape', 'found', 'be', 'slightly', 'different', 'other', 'Living', 'Yoga', 'series', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'so', 'far', 'pace', 'little', 'faster', 'expected', 'certainly', 'work', 'up', 'sweat', 'performing', 'movements', 'reason', 'seem', 'maintain', 'good', 'level', 'relaxation', 'concentration.-', 'modifications', 'beginners', 'who', 'are', 'less', 'flexible', 'are', 'END', 'tape', 'opposed', 'being', 'demonstrated', 'specific', 'movements', 'could', 'pose', 'problem', 'who', 'are', 'totally', 'unfamiliar', 'possible', 'yoga', 'modifications', 'once', 'see', 'are', 'pretty', 'simple', 'remember.-', 'tape', 'lower', 'body', 'need', 'pretty', 'decent', 'abdominal', 'stregnth', 'balance', 'moves', 'involve', 'balancing', 'one', 'foot', 'concentration', 'not', 'something', 'will', 'make', 'whole', 'workout', 'too', 'challenging', 'beginner', 'may', 'not', 'be', 'everyone', 'time', 'however', 'elements', 'will', 'become', 'easier', 'just', 'eventually', 'end', 'up', 'routine', 'part', 'workout', 'would', 'suggest', 'little', 'discouraged', 'elements', 'keep', 'once', 'get', 'there', 'results', 'are', 'really', 'quite', 'amazing', 'tape', 'most', 'definately', 'results', 'FAST', 'always', 'Living', 'Yoga', 'suggests', 'view', 'entire', 'tape', 'getting', 'down', 'yoga', 'mat', 'working', 'out', 'pace', 'tape', 'first', 'viewing', 'may', 'seem', 'too', 'challenging', 'most', 'beginners', 'must', 'admit', 'too', 'was', 'intimidated', 'watching', 'first', 'time', 'fact', 'tossed', 'shelf', 'few', 'days', 'gathered', 'up', 'courage', 'THEN', 'gave', 'try', 'not', 'HALF', 'as', 'intimidating', 'fast-paced', 'manage', 'maintain', 'good', 'level', 'relaxation', 'inner', 'peace.Over', 'would', 'reccommend', 'anyone', 'interested', 'yoga', 'anyone', 'who', 'elaborate', 'lower', 'body', 'workouts', 'A.M.', '/', 'P.M.', 'series', 'would', 'reccommend', 'just', 'everyone', 'know', 'more', 'someone', 'little', 'more', ""'hard"", 'core', 'yoga-train', 'possibly', 'someone', 'who', 'working', 'out', 'regular', 'basis']",Lower Body Yoga for Beginners VHS
550153,AK7CAW3N1XZV6,B00004T6FK,"Beth Cholette ""doctor_beth""","[5, 5]","First of all, several reviewers have mentioned that this tape is not for beginners, but it is important to remember that ALL of the videos in the Living Arts series recommend that you start with ""Yoga Practice for Beginners"" if you are not familiar with yoga poses.  That being said, this is a relatively fast-paced tape that can be a little hard to follow at first, so I'd highly recommend watching the tape before attempting to follow along, especially since there are modifications at the end of the tape.I consider myself a yoga beginner with limited flexibility, yet with modifications, I was able to perform all of the poses on this tape.  Some of the poses which require balance are pretty tough, but you can always support yourself if needed.  Although this tape focuses on lower body through mainly standing, kneeling, and seated forward bend poses, I feel it gives me a fairly good upper body workout as well given the many upward dog repetitions.I appreciate Suzanne Deason's calm, supportive manner and her supple, yet not overly-unrealistic body.  Her style is warm and engaging, and there are no ""new-agey"" aspects to the video.  The scenery is attractive and soothing as well.  Overall, I really enjoy this video and love that I can do it in a short time frame.",5,"A short, fast-paced yoga workout focusing on the lower body.",1018224000,"04 8, 2002",2002,1276,"['First', 'all', 'several', 'reviewers', 'have', 'mentioned', 'tape', 'not', 'beginners', 'important', 'remember', 'videos', 'Living', 'Arts', 'series', 'recommend', 'start', 'Yoga', 'Practice', 'Beginners', 'are', 'not', 'familiar', 'yoga', 'poses', 'being', 'said', 'relatively', 'fast-paced', 'tape', 'can', 'be', 'little', 'hard', 'follow', 'first', 'so', ""'d"", 'highly', 'recommend', 'watching', 'tape', 'attempting', 'follow', 'along', 'especially', 'are', 'modifications', 'end', 'tape.I', 'consider', 'yoga', 'beginner', 'limited', 'flexibility', 'yet', 'modifications', 'was', 'able', 'perform', 'poses', 'tape', 'poses', 'require', 'balance', 'are', 'pretty', 'tough', 'can', 'always', 'support', 'needed', 'tape', 'lower', 'body', 'mainly', 'standing', 'kneeling', 'seated', 'forward', 'bend', 'poses', 'feel', 'fairly', 'good', 'upper', 'body', 'workout', 'well', 'given', 'many', 'upward', 'dog', 'repetitions.I', 'appreciate', 'Suzanne', 'Deason', 'calm', 'supportive', 'manner', 'supple', 'yet', 'not', 'overly-unrealistic', 'body', 'style', 'warm', 'engaging', 'are', 'new-agey', 'aspects', 'video', 'scenery', 'attractive', 'soothing', 'as', 'well', 'Overall', 'really', 'enjoy', 'video', 'love', 'can', 'do', 'short', 'time', 'frame']",Lower Body Yoga for Beginners VHS

I think the instructor's delivery is rather unenthusiastic, although I find it soothing in the relaxation portion, and I feel like I need to hold the poses longer to really benefit from them. It does work the lower body, and it's short enough to do before you go to work, but I just can't get excited about it.",3,Just OK,986774400,"04 9, 2001",2001,456,"['notice', 'reviews', 'are', 'really', 'mixed', 'tape', 'say', 'just', 'OK', 'have', 'lots', 'yoga', 'tapes', 'one', 'reach', 'least', 'think', 'instructor', 'delivery', 'rather', 'unenthusiastic', 'find', 'soothing', 'relaxation', 'portion', 'feel', 'need', 'hold', 'poses', 'longer', 'really', 'benefit', 'work', 'lower', 'body', 'short', 'enough', 'do', 'go', 'work', 'just', 'ca', ""n't"", 'get', 'excited']",Lower Body Yoga for Beginners VHS

I felt like I worked my entire body, but yet felt limber at the same time.I would agree with other reviewers that this is probably not a program for beginners.  I would recommend this program to people who:1. like a fast moving, flowing workout2. are looking for a more physical practice3. have some experience with yoga (intermediate beginner, or intermediate)4. are fairly flexibleI also would agree with other reviewers that the audio dubbing is off some, but this happens in a lot of yoga DVDs and it doesn't bother me too much.  If that is something that bothers you - the dubbing not always being EXACTLY on queue with the movement - you may get annoyed by this DVD.  But I find that you can either watch the screen and ignore the dubbing (and only move when she moves), OR listen to the dubbing and just not watch it.",5,WOW...,1218326400,"08 10, 2008",2008,949,"['Fantastic', 'quick', 'moving', 'flowing', 'practice', 'program', 'got', 'body', 'heat', 'heart', 'rate', 'felt', 'GREAT', 'afterwards', 'felt', 'worked', 'entire', 'body', 'yet', 'felt', 'limber', 'same', 'time.I', 'would', 'agree', 'other', 'reviewers', 'probably', 'not', 'program', 'beginners', 'would', 'recommend', 'program', 'people', 'who:1.', 'fast', 'moving', 'flowing', 'workout2', 'are', 'looking', 'more', 'physical', 'practice3', 'have', 'experience', 'yoga', 'intermediate', 'beginner', 'intermediate', '4.', 'are', 'fairly', 'flexibleI', 'also', 'would', 'agree', 'other', 'reviewers', 'audio', 'dubbing', 'lot', 'yoga', 'DVDs', ""n't"", 'bother', 'too', 'much', 'something', 'bothers', 'dubbing', 'not', 'always', 'being', 'EXACTLY', 'queue', 'movement', 'may', 'get', 'annoyed', 'DVD', 'find', 'can', 'either', 'watch', 'screen', 'ignore', 'dubbing', 'only', 'move', 'when', 'OR', 'dubbing', 'just', 'not', 'watch']",Lower Body Yoga for Beginners VHS

After a brief 3-minute introduction Suzanne, who is alone, guides us through a series of postures using a voice-over. She does not use any Sanskrit terms, and anyone who is bothered by some of the more mystical practices will feel very comfortable with this one. It is labeled beginner, but the poses she shows are not modified. Fortunately, there is a segment at the end which demonstrates modifications using a strap or a block. There is quiet, pleasant music in the background, similar to that heard in other Gaiam yoga DVDs.",5,Beautiful Maui,1316476800,"09 20, 2011",2011,664,"['backdrop', '25-minute', 'yoga', 'DVD', 'called', 'lower', 'body', 'vinyasa', 'practice', 'more', 'just', 'lower', 'body', 'brief', '3-minute', 'introduction', 'Suzanne', 'who', 'alone', 'guides', 'series', 'postures', 'using', 'voice-over', 'not', 'use', 'Sanskrit', 'terms', 'anyone', 'who', 'bothered', 'more', 'mystical', 'practices', 'will', 'feel', 'very', 'comfortable', 'one', 'labeled', 'beginner', 'poses', 'shows', 'are', 'not', 'modified', 'Fortunately', 'segment', 'end', 'modifications', 'using', 'strap', 'block', 'quiet', 'pleasant', 'music', 'background', 'similar', 'heard', 'other', 'Gaiam', 'yoga', 'DVDs']",Lower Body Yoga for Beginners VHS

I consider myself to be an advanced beginner and I had a hard time with this one.  Most beginners could not do half of what she does.  She only shows modifications at the end which doesn't do much good.  She does the half moon, warrior 3 and another balancing pose that I am sorry but I do not know the name of.  (Looks like a tea pot pouring tea).  They aren't advanced poses, but they aren't real easy either.  She also moves into them rather quickly, I couldn't keep up.  I kept up better with Rodney Yees Power Yoga (not for beginners)! Even the stretches she does in the end are impossible for someone who is not extremely flexible.  Better know some modifications to do this one.  I was really frustated, almost gave up. The reason I gave it a two and not a one is because I think it would be great for someone more advanced(but it says for beginners). As always with Gaiam, the scenery is beautiful.
