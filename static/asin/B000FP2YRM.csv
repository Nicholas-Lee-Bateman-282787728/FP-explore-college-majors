993806,A2U2K57OFWD1CA,B000FP2YRM,A. Clark,"[0, 1]","I discovered Alex O'Loughlin last year with reruns on SyFy of Moonlight and immediately became fascinated not only with his devastatingly sexy good looks, but also with his unbelievable acting talents.  I was hesitant to watch ""Feed"" because of its content, but I am so glad that I finally did.  When one gets passed the first stage of shock and then revulsion (yeah, it's pretty graphic and not for everyone) it is actually a fascinating and disturbing study of a little-known fetish.  Alex's dialogs (brilliantly delivered) about consumption, body image, and love were nothing short of riveting and thought-provoking.  I applaud Alex and the entire cast and crew for having the guts to write, produce and film this movie.  It really was brilliant and a must-see for Alex fans - it clearly showcases his acting versatility with the multi-layered character of Michael Carter who can be adorable and charming one minute and morph into one of the creepiest and horrifyingly disturbing characters ever on screen.  With a bigger budget and production schedule, many of the flaws that can be seen could have been worked out.  It didn't come off as a horror flick to me, but rather an uncomfortable, creepy, quietly disturbing film - I definitely lost some sleep after viewing it. The interviews with Alex (OMG, he is SO gorgeous and was that EVER a really special treat!), cast and crew along with outtakes, the premiere, and other features on this DVD were a wonderful addition to the background info on the creating and making of this movie.  Since I did purchase this from Amazon (as I did all of Alex's other works)for my Alex collection, I can't wait to show it to others, see their reactions, and have some very lively discussions on this. Did I love the black humor and the soundtrack??  I really did and I'm smiling now just thinking about it.  Listening to those pop-culture, favorite songs will never be the same ever again !!!",4,a hidden jewel....a must-see for Alex fans,1299542400,"03 8, 2011",2011,1932,"['discovered', 'Alex', ""O'Loughlin"", 'last', 'year', 'reruns', 'SyFy', 'Moonlight', 'immediately', 'became', 'fascinated', 'not', 'only', 'devastatingly', 'sexy', 'good', 'looks', 'also', 'unbelievable', 'acting', 'talents', 'was', 'hesitant', 'watch', 'Feed', 'content', 'am', 'so', 'glad', 'finally', 'did', 'When', 'one', 'passed', 'first', 'stage', 'shock', 'then', 'revulsion', 'yeah', 'pretty', 'graphic', 'not', 'everyone', 'actually', 'fascinating', 'disturbing', 'study', 'little-known', 'fetish', 'Alex', 'dialogs', 'brilliantly', 'delivered', 'consumption', 'body', 'image', 'love', 'were', 'nothing', 'short', 'riveting', 'thought-provoking', 'applaud', 'Alex', 'entire', 'cast', 'crew', 'having', 'guts', 'write', 'produce', 'film', 'movie', 'really', 'was', 'brilliant', 'must-see', 'Alex', 'fans', 'clearly', 'acting', 'versatility', 'multi-layered', 'character', 'Michael', 'Carter', 'who', 'can', 'be', 'adorable', 'charming', 'one', 'minute', 'morph', 'one', 'creepiest', 'horrifyingly', 'disturbing', 'characters', 'ever', 'screen', 'bigger', 'budget', 'production', 'schedule', 'many', 'flaws', 'can', 'be', 'seen', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'worked', 'out', 'did', ""n't"", 'come', 'off', 'horror', 'flick', 'rather', 'uncomfortable', 'creepy', 'quietly', 'disturbing', 'film', 'definitely', 'lost', 'sleep', 'viewing', 'interviews', 'Alex', 'OMG', 'SO', 'gorgeous', 'was', 'EVER', 'really', 'special', 'treat', 'cast', 'crew', 'along', 'outtakes', 'premiere', 'other', 'features', 'DVD', 'were', 'wonderful', 'addition', 'background', 'info', 'creating', 'making', 'movie', 'did', 'purchase', 'Amazon', 'did', 'Alex', 'other', 'works', 'Alex', 'collection', 'ca', ""n't"", 'wait', 'show', 'others', 'see', 'reactions', 'have', 'very', 'lively', 'discussions', 'Did', 'love', 'black', 'humor', 'soundtrack', 'really', 'did', ""'m"", 'smiling', 'now', 'just', 'thinking', 'Listening', 'pop-culture', 'favorite', 'songs', 'will', 'never', 'be', 'same', 'ever', 'again']",N/A

But that certainly doesn't mean I like to go around fattening people up until they become immobile and die. Most feeders are not sadists - in fact, quite the contrary.I don't want to be that annoying person who has to take a silly movie much too seriously, but it just pains me that film-makers who clearly know next to nothing about feederism, have to go and represent us in such an awful way to the impressionable, 'normal' public.But, with that said, 'Feed' certainly does deliver the thrills and chills, and is thus worthy of the three stars that I have (rather leniently) given it. Granted, most of you probably DO think we're all a bunch of wicked perverts, but if its any consolation, I found this movie to be about as erotic as my grand-dad in knickers, so obviously the film-makers aren't getting things quite right. The soul purpose of this movie is to shock and disgust, and mission accomplished. The opening scene with the two German fellows (based on real happenings, don't you know) was unsettling to say the least. The rest of the characters are unlikable and unsympathetic. The flashbacks into Michael's motivations shed very little light on anything. The fat suits looked laughably fake. The cop's accent offended me as an Australian citizen (but only a little bit; I don't want to get all patriotic on you).

A sociopath who likes to feed women to death.....how could that not make a good story? Well, the makers of this film managed to bungle it from almost the very beginning.First, there was the inclusion of scenes of the detective getting it on with his girlfriend. Okay, they needed to show some nudity and sex to attact young males to see their movie, but it really didn't have anything to do with the plot. I can see a little connection between the detective's sexual practices to that of the sociopath's, but it wasn't presented in a way that could lead to some sort of deeper understanding of the detective's mind.There were a ton of mistakes in the plot that either didn't fit in with the rest of the movie , or didn't make any sense whatsoever. Would you accept a cup of coffee from your nemesis, whom you know to be a serial killer, and then drink it? I literally winced as the detective drank it down.

993820,A1E8RJN1L9UMHX,B000FP2YRM,IKCWMBFD,"[3, 7]","This is a tough one.  Feed has a lot of problems, and I mean a lot: some pretty bad dialogue, a lot of sloppy writing and plotting, rushed botched execution, inconsistent acting, and on.  The police procedural at the heart of this story is both annoyingly simplified and pretty much devoid of suspense and, while I admire and agree with the decision to pursue the idea of the parallelism of the cop and his prey here, it's just not that subtly or artfully accomplished.  The themes wind up getting too explicitly and overtly played out in speeches and arguments rather than as they should be, by watching characters act and do their thing.  (On the plus side though, the actress who plays the girlfriend of the cop is very nice on the eyes.) Take the feeder/gainer particular subculture completely out of this picture and you would have a quite ordinary and formulaic low budget police movie in the Seven mode that you would never bother to think about after and probably just avoid ahead of time.And yet, there is the aspect of this bizarre subculture and that is the real reason this movie seems to exist at all. And I have to admit that this element in the movie really did lead me think more about the underlying nature of horror in films and how some things, which are supposedly disturbing, are not really disturbing in their genre-film incarnations, but other things are.  Because the sight of so much expansive human flesh (faked or not) and the spectacle of excessive consumption was indeed truly disgusting as far as I was concerned and certainly forced me to own up to my own squeamishness about obesity (and sexuality co-existing for sure). I have watched many a film where graphic dismemberment or torture takes place and barely flinched but I felt genuinely rather ill at ease watching relatively tender scenes of feeder-gainer mutual pleasuring. So is feeling just nauseous, ill at ease, or grossed-out really the actual point of watching horror films anyway? Probably not. Otherwise you might just watch Fassbinder's In a Year of 13 Moons over and over again for your ""horror"" fix (and maybe not just for the slaughterhouse scene but for general human cruelty and pathos). Whereas, the killings in various I Know What You Did the Summer Before the Last One-like slashers are purely *pleasurable* viewing, to be honest, and not upsetting or disgusting in the least. Are the people who think Fulci is the greatest thing in ""horror"" feeling disgusted or grossed out when they watch his staged scenes of bodily injury, cannibalism, etc., in the same way as one might feel revulsion at watching an act of overeating in Feed? It's a strange question, because really, this film contains no particularly graphic on-screen deaths and very little bloodletting and yet it did feel like a ""horror"" film to me. And of course, there is the intriguing issue of what exactly the nature of the crime the cop believes he is pursuing is, the strange nature of unconventional behavior that society questions but that two individuals agree mutually to perform behind closed doors.So, although this movie is not a particularly good one as thrillers (or horror films) go, it's not without interest or ""food for thought"" (yikes) and it's quite possibly unique in its emphasis (though it seems there are a few recent consensual cannibalism films out there I can't compare with or speak to).

993821,A3C6CZC2JP67VK,B000FP2YRM,"Jenny J.J.I. ""A New Yorker""","[54, 60]","Many of you have probably never heard of this film before as did I til Chris brought it to my attention a couple of months ago. It's a shame that so many fantastic films get swept under the carpet while atrocious films get all the glory. (Take 80% of the horror remakes we've been forced to endure for example). Though this film is not so great it really bothers me when a unique and clever film such as ""Feed"" comes and goes almost without a trace. So here I am, doing my part to get this film the notoriety and respect it deserves. When it comes to fresh material, ""Feed"" is what I'd imagine it would feel like if someone was intentionally drowning you until the point where every red-blood cell in your body was screaming for oxygen. But a split second before you expire, they lift your head into the fresh air and the initial breath is so refreshing you feel euphoric.""Feed"" is based on an underground sexual fetish known as ""feederism."" Feederism is a sexual fetish (specifically a type of body alteration fetishism), centered on the practice of eating large amounts of food. The feeder provides the gainer with an abundant supply of food, either to encourage weight gain or simply for delight in the act of feeding. The feeder is typically more dominant, while the gainer is often more submissive, although this is not always the case. The fetish caters to those who have fantasies of growing fatter, or feeding another. O'Loughlin plays the role of Michael Carter, a man who runs a website where women are fed until they are unable to move or care for themselves and participates sexual acts with these women. Thompson plays the role of Detective Phillip Jackson, a veteran of cyberporn investigations who has discovered something terribly wrong is happening and is determined to find out what is hidden within the pages of the grotesque website.I challenge anyone to try and convince me that a horror plot based on ""feederism"" isn't original and (lets face it) intriguing. We've been bombarded with hoards of zombies, increasingly watered down slashers and poltergeists for some time now and it's about time someone stepped up to the plate to deliver something new and original. (No pun intended).The acting in ""Feed"" is decent but not that great. Most notably, Alex O'Loughlin and Patrick Thompson, I read that they actually came up with the idea for the film.This movie had left me half full because it had so much room for improvement. The ending will be unforeseen to a lot of viewers but that couldn't make up for the lost that I already encountered either way its still worth a watch.",3,Do you know what Feederism mean?,1212019200,"05 29, 2008",2008,2598,"['Many', 'have', 'probably', 'never', 'heard', 'film', 'did', 'til', 'Chris', 'brought', 'attention', 'couple', 'months', 'ago', 'shame', 'so', 'many', 'fantastic', 'films', 'get', 'swept', 'carpet', 'atrocious', 'films', 'get', 'glory', 'Take', '80', '%', 'horror', ""'ve"", 'been', 'forced', 'endure', 'example', 'film', 'not', 'so', 'great', 'really', 'bothers', 'when', 'unique', 'clever', 'film', 'such', 'Feed', 'almost', 'trace', 'here', 'am', 'doing', 'part', 'get', 'film', 'notoriety', 'respect', 'When', 'fresh', 'material', 'Feed', 'what', ""'d"", 'imagine', 'would', 'feel', 'someone', 'was', 'intentionally', 'drowning', 'point', 'where', 'red-blood', 'cell', 'body', 'was', 'screaming', 'oxygen', 'split', 'second', 'expire', 'lift', 'head', 'fresh', 'air', 'initial', 'breath', 'so', 'refreshing', 'feel', 'euphoric', 'Feed', 'based', 'underground', 'sexual', 'fetish', 'known', 'feederism', 'Feederism', 'sexual', 'fetish', 'specifically', 'type', 'body', 'alteration', 'fetishism', 'centered', 'practice', 'eating', 'large', 'amounts', 'food', 'feeder', 'gainer', 'abundant', 'supply', 'food', 'encourage', 'weight', 'gain', 'simply', 'delight', 'act', 'feeding', 'feeder', 'typically', 'more', 'dominant', 'gainer', 'often', 'more', 'submissive', 'not', 'always', 'case', 'fetish', 'caters', 'who', 'have', 'fantasies', 'growing', 'fatter', 'feeding', ""O'Loughlin"", 'role', 'Michael', 'Carter', 'man', 'who', 'website', 'where', 'women', 'are', 'fed', 'are', 'unable', 'move', 'care', 'sexual', 'acts', 'women', 'Thompson', 'role', 'Detective', 'Phillip', 'Jackson', 'veteran', 'cyberporn', 'investigations', 'who', 'discovered', 'something', 'terribly', 'wrong', 'happening', 'determined', 'find', 'out', 'what', 'hidden', 'pages', 'grotesque', 'website.I', 'challenge', 'anyone', 'try', 'convince', 'horror', 'plot', 'based', 'feederism', ""n't"", 'original', 'lets', 'face', 'intriguing', ""'ve"", 'been', 'bombarded', 'hoards', 'zombies', 'increasingly', 'watered', 'slashers', 'poltergeists', 'time', 'now', 'time', 'someone', 'stepped', 'up', 'plate', 'deliver', 'something', 'new', 'original', 'pun', 'intended', '.The', 'acting', 'Feed', 'decent', 'not', 'great', 'Most', 'notably', 'Alex', ""O'Loughlin"", 'Patrick', 'Thompson', 'read', 'actually', 'came', 'up', 'idea', 'film.This', 'movie', 'had', 'left', 'half', 'full', 'had', 'so', 'much', 'room', 'improvement', 'ending', 'will', 'be', 'unforeseen', 'lot', 'viewers', 'could', ""n't"", 'make', 'up', 'lost', 'already', 'encountered', 'way', 'still', 'watch']",N/A

I, of course, prefer the treatment as a thin person, but find it sad how I was judged even though I am the same person no matter what my size...but society doesn't always recognize that. But this movie takes the idea of what is ""beautiful"" and what isn't to a different level. At first I was disgusted by the entire movie...but kept watching and was soon pulled in by it. Alex O'Loughlin's performance is fabulous! His portrayal of Michael Carter, a man that grew up with a possessive, overbearing, ""fat"" mother that lead him to this ""out of the norm"" obsession with fat women, is brilliantly acted. He draws you in and gives a hauntingly, chilling performance. His character is far from the recent clean cut, handsome Navy Seal Lt. Commander on H50. I'm not sure if it is for everyone. It deals with a subject matter that some people may be very uncomfortable with or disgusted by with a thriller twist...but I think the average open-minded thriller movie person would enjoy it.

Being a connoisseur of sick and twisted films, I could not resist the tag on the box from the Daily Record--""Cross 'Super Size Me' with 'The Silence of the Lambs'."" Seemed like a marriage made in heaven! I didn't go into this film expecting art, but --ultimately-- I guess I expected something more filling.The first third of the film has a pleasant nastiness to it. With tons of quick cuts (mostly unnecessary), an amped sound track, loads of gratuitous nudity, sufficient violence, raunchy kinkiness and plenty of unsettling images--the film introduced us to it's two main characters. The set-up and the initial Internet investigation into the subject of ""feeders"" and ""gainers"" seemed promising. If the entire film could have kept up this lurid, over-the-top pace--I'd have been singing this film's praises.Alas, no--we moved into the actual investigation as our Australian hero(?) traveled to America to hunt his prey. Unfortunately, this is where the film had to rely more on acting and it's script. Based on the slickness of the beginning, it was unfortunate to be lurched so quickly into amateurishness and some of the worst American accents possible. But I'm forgiving, and I would have been able to overlook this--but the procedural as our cop identifies and tracks down our ""feeder"" is so preposterous and unbelievable. I won't ruin any of it for you--but I was yearning, at this point, for more depravity and less ""plot"".Anyway, as you might imagine, the third act of the film is the cliche'd showdown. Luckily, it's better than the what preceded it--sadly, it was pretty typical of every ""serial killer"" movie you've ever seen. Tack on a ridiculous ending, and you've got yourself a movie.I was torn about what to rate this film. I was going to give it only 2 stars based on actual merit. However, I know there are a lot of other sickos out there (like me) who will be intrigued by the premise. So, I'm going with 3 stars. Why? It's a disturbing subject you haven't seen before. It's competently made and looks good. And the depravity is well established, especially in the beginning. You may not love it--but for all that is ripped-off from other movies, there are some genuinely unique and unsettling images and ideas too.I may feel dirty in the morning--but I'm giving this flawed, but intriguingly nasty film, a 3.

993828,A2NJO6YE954DBH,B000FP2YRM,Lawrance M. Bernabo,"[2, 4]","It has been some time since I have seen a horror film as thoroughly dedicated to trying to make you throw up as ""Feed."" One clear clue as to this intent is the number of times somebody in the movie throws up or at least starts gagging and covering their mouths while their eyes bug out (the film's tagline is ""Can you stomach it?""). I think it is inevitable that you will be reminded of the death of the glutton in the opening act of ""Se7en,"" only ""Feed"" wants to wallow in the entire idea of death by eating and to link it with sexual fetishism and web cams. There is a world of Feeders (men who admire fat women) and Gainers (the fat women they admire), and apparently we can watch it on our home computers for a nominal membership fee.Philip Jackson (Patrick Thompson) is an Australian detective who works for an Interpol cybercrime unit Down Under and who stumbles upon a website where voyeurs watch a 600-pound woman named Deirdre (Gabby Millgate) being fed. Jackson is repulsed by what he sees, but more importantly he is suspicious, especially when the Webmaster starts blocking his moves on the Internet and the website involves making bets for some macabre reason that is not immediately clear to him. Jackson knows that starving somebody is a crime, and even though his boss points out that hardly means the converse is true, the detective is perfectly willing to be judge and jury on this one. So Jackson heads for Toledo, Ohio, to track down Michael Carter (Alex O'Loughlin) in his lair so that they can go toe-to-toe in their battle of wills and deep seated psychoses, never realizing that he is being led into a trap.Millgate's face and fingers are not built up to match the giant nearly naked fat suit she is forced to act beneath, but you get over the grotesque appearance of her character as you try to understand why she is letting this be done to her. Then again, the line separating Carter from Jackson does not appear to constitute a great distance on the sanity scale. This is one of those movies where the hero is running around like a lunatic, and the villain is the calm voice of reason, at least until you remember Deirdre suspended on her floating bed under the watchful eye of Carter's web cam. It takes a while for this movie to get all three of the principles in the same room at the same time, but that is when the fun begins.In the end I did not even have to round up to get to a 4 star rating because ""Feed"" works out its end game in terms of its own logic (no it did not make me throw up, but it is going to claim its fair share of victims unless their finger can out race their gag reflex when it comes to finding the stop button their remote). Jackson has tracked Carter to his sick little world and been invited in, and the resolution clearly stays within those parameters. The resolution might be sick and it might be totally twisted, but it is ring true given what has happened. You can always get somebody in a movie, but the question is whether you can get them really good, with all that entrails in the darker regions of your mind where the impulse towards the sort of justice Dante envisioned being parceled out in Hell, and I think ""Feed"" pulls it off on that score. However, it was a close call as the alternative ending, which tacks on a totally unnecessary scene, amply indicates.

In Feed, he explores the world of Feeders & Gainers.Alex O'Loughlin plays Michael Carter, a Feeder who films feeding women online and tracks their vital stats for placing bets as to when they will die. Det. Jackson (Patrick Thompson) finds the website and decides to track down Carter and prove he is a serial killer despite the fact the women are voluntarily fed.I suppose the film leaves the notion of killing by weight gain up for debate. Both men have valid arguments while neither is truly right. Carter argues that he is helping the women by not judging them and allowing them to take whatever shape they want. He states that the ridiculous ideal woman in America now is an androgynous, hairless, waif that resembles a [...] boy. Det. Jackson argues that since the Gainers eventually die, it is murder. We would prosecute someone for starving another person, then why not for over-feeding her?Another interesting contrast between the two men is their relationships with women. While Carter is perceived as a serial killer and therefore the Bad Guy, he showers the women in his life with attention and love (even the overweight ones). Det. Jackson is very hypocritical in his notion of saving women considering the abusive relationship he has with his skinny girlfriend.I feel Carter is the perfect villain. He is sweet, handsome, and charming. He is a stranger you would trust talking to on a street. O'Loughlin plays the role well and can effectively sway from debonair to downright creepy.Now to the gore.... I was disgusted in a way by the film. While there are scenes of overeating and food fed by a tube down a throat, these actually did not bother me. In fact, I was amused by the song, ""Yummy, Yummy, Yummy, I've got Love in my tummy"" played to a woman being fed multiple burgers. What I was disturbed by were the desperate women who equate food with love. As long as the Gainer is getting food, she is happy. Even when the truth is revealed at the end, the women do not care. They would rather eat and kill themselves, than stop and anger the man they love for fear of being alone.The ending was perfect. I felt it was going in a certain direction, but I was pleasantly surprised. It is a warped variation of the Good Guy wins scenario.

I bought FEED first, and it is one of the best movies I have ever seen.  Alex came up with the concept of ""feeders and gainers"" and did months of research on the subculture.  He co-created, co-wrote, co-produced and starred in the film, and his portrayal of Michael Carter showcases this Australian actor's incredible talent.  His American accent is impeccable, and I have never seen an actor capable of expressing so many different emotions without ever having to say a word.The entire cast is outstanding - Gabby Millgate plays Deirdre, Michael's ""gainer"".  She is a comedic actress, and she and Alex play off of one another so well.  One thing I love about FEED is that it is a psychological thriller, but there is so much humor in the movie as well.  If you like a bit of comic relief in your dramas, FEED has plenty of it.  Just listening to Michael's rants to Phillip, the cyper crime specialist (played by Patrick Thompson) who is the so-called protaganist of the film is a delight.  Michael may be considered the ""villian"" of the story, but by the end of the movie, I was so taken with his character, I was cheering him on. If there was ever a character who would be considered an ""anti-hero"", Michael would be at the top of my list.Some of my favorite parts of FEED are in the extras on the DVD - the deleted scenes, interviews with Alex and the producer, etc.  I would recommend that anyone watching this DVD for the first time watch the extras first, especially the interview with Alex, where he explains how he came up with the idea of ""feeders and gainers"" and how he brought it to film.The soundtrack is wonderful - I will never hear ""Cherish"" and ""Yummy, Yummy, Yummy"" again without thinking of FEED, and seeing Michael's little dance to ""Itsy Bitsy Teeny Weeny Yellow Polka Dot Bikini"" is worth the price of the DVD all by itself.I am impressed by the fact that this movie was made in 28 days.  It is realistic, thought provoking and highly entertaining.  The Australian film industry is apparently small compared to the American industry, but in my opinion, they do amazing work.  Since seeing FEED I have watched other movies that Alex made before coming to the US and other Australian films as well - they have incredible talent in all aspects of filmmaking.After watching FEED check out the alternate ending in the extras.

It hits a lot of my personal kinks and combines them with what could have been a pretty solid serial killer plotline, it's got some decent performances, and Brett Leonard has directed the occasional decent film over the years (okay, maybe no one else liked &lt;em>Virtuosity&lt;/em>, but I did). And all too often there are glimmers of how good this movie could have been; there's certainly enough here to make it worth your time, as long as you can stomach (no pun intended) the subject matter. But man, it goes south in a big way, and that can be blamed entirely on screenwriter Kieran Galvin. But I'm getting ahead of myself.Plot: Michael Carter (&lt;em>Whiteout&lt;/em>'s Alex O'Loughlin), an Australian cybercrimes detective, happens upon a feeder website--an adult-oriented site dedicated to super-sized women eating while naked. (I have seen a couple of offhand comments wondering if these sorts of things actually exist. Yes.) Something is off about the site, and Michael can't put his finger on it, so he signs up and gets full access... at which point he sees that the site's patrons are given an option to place bets on how long the site's current model will live. That screams ""serial killer"", so he heads off to Ohio in order to investigate the site's administrator, Phillip Jackson (&lt;em>Man-Thing&lt;/em>'s Patrick Thompson). Thus begins a game of cat and mouse.It's all quite lovingly rendered, and as far as the plot goes, it's solid as they come. Where Galvin screws up (or Thompson and O'Loughlin, who came up with the original idea, screwed up) is in Jackson's psychology, which is depressingly Abnormal Psych 101, with no variations on the theme. Which might not have been a problem had we not had a few long scenes of Jackson explaining his methodology to Carter and/or flashing back to scenes from his young life. The predictability is grating, to say the least, and undercuts what is otherwise a pretty good mystery with a healthy dose of kink. ** ",3,"Not bad, but could have been so so much better.",1325116800,"12 29, 2011",2011,2069,"['lt', 'strong', '>', 'Feed', 'lt', '>', 'Brett', 'Leonard', '2005', 'movie', 'desperately', 'wanted', 'like', 'lot', 'personal', 'kinks', 'combines', 'what', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'pretty', 'solid', 'serial', 'killer', 'plotline', 'got', 'decent', 'performances', 'Brett', 'Leonard', 'directed', 'occasional', 'decent', 'film', 'years', 'okay', 'maybe', 'one', 'else', 'liked', 'lt', '>', 'Virtuosity', 'lt', '>', 'did', 'too', 'often', 'are', 'glimmers', 'how', 'good', 'movie', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'certainly', 'enough', 'here', 'make', 'time', 'as', 'long', 'can', 'stomach', 'pun', 'intended', 'subject', 'matter', 'man', 'south', 'big', 'way', 'can', 'be', 'blamed', 'entirely', 'screenwriter', 'Kieran', 'Galvin', ""'m"", 'getting', 'ahead', 'myself.Plot', 'Michael', 'Carter', 'lt', '>', 'Whiteout', 'lt', '/em', '>', 'Alex', ""O'Loughlin"", 'Australian', 'cybercrimes', 'detective', 'feeder', 'website', 'adult-oriented', 'site', 'dedicated', 'super-sized', 'women', 'eating', 'naked', 'have', 'seen', 'couple', 'offhand', 'comments', 'wondering', 'sorts', 'things', 'actually', 'exist', 'Yes', 'Something', 'site', 'Michael', 'ca', ""n't"", 'put', 'finger', 'signs', 'up', 'full', 'access', 'point', 'site', 'patrons', 'are', 'given', 'option', 'place', 'bets', 'how', 'long', 'site', 'current', 'model', 'will', 'live', 'serial', 'killer', 'Ohio', 'order', 'investigate', 'site', 'administrator', 'Phillip', 'Jackson', 'lt', '>', 'Man-Thing', 'lt', '/em', '>', 'Patrick', 'Thompson', 'Thus', 'game', 'cat', 'mouse.It', 'quite', 'lovingly', 'rendered', 'as', 'far', 'plot', 'solid', 'come', 'Where', 'Galvin', 'up', 'Thompson', ""O'Loughlin"", 'who', 'came', 'up', 'original', 'idea', 'screwed', 'up', 'Jackson', 'psychology', 'depressingly', 'Abnormal', 'Psych', '101', 'variations', 'theme', 'might', 'not', 'have', 'been', 'problem', 'had', 'not', 'had', 'few', 'long', 'scenes', 'Jackson', 'explaining', 'methodology', 'Carter', 'and/or', 'flashing', 'back', 'scenes', 'young', 'life', 'predictability', 'grating', 'say', 'least', 'undercuts', 'what', 'otherwise', 'pretty', 'good', 'mystery', 'healthy', 'dose', 'kink', '**']",N/A

993838,A2PN7Z2VTHICL8,B000FP2YRM,"Schtinky ""Schtinky""","[3, 10]","Australian detective Phillip Jackson (Patrick Thompson) investigates cyberporn sites, even such perverted ones as self-condoned cannibalism.  He runs across a website with fellow investigator Nigel (Matthew Le Nevez) that consists of ""Feeders"" and ""Gainers"", people who love grotesquely overweight people.  On this website is 602 pound ""gainer"" Deidre (played quite well by Gabby Millgate) and her ""feeder"" Michael Carter (also a well acted role by Alex O'Loughlin).Detective Jackson goes overboard when he discovers that the feeder is attempting to kill his gainer and going so far as taking Vegas-style wagers on how big she'll be when she dies.  Although taken off the case by his boss, he jumps a plane and travels to Toledo, Ohio, USA to catch up with Michael Carter and confront him.What follows are some overdone and over dramatized scenes of confrontation, along with psuedo-psychological (supposedly) nuggets of witty intellectual discourse.  However, even a bit of good acting and a great soundtrack can't save this film from its script, its poor photography, and its over-the-top sensationalism.  (it takes years and years to kill someone by overeating - no one is going to be placing Vegas-style bets on it)  The ending did have a nice little twist, in case you decide to sit it out through the rest of the movie.There is a little bit of gore, and a bit of nasty fat-melting and cannibalism going on, but not enough to distract from the mediocrity of the film.  Overall, definitely rent before you buy, and you might even want to get your rental fee back.  I don't recommend this movie, it didn't live up to the hype of the editorial or other reviews.",2,Didn't offer up the taste I was expecting,1178064000,"05 2, 2007",2007,1663,"['Australian', 'detective', 'Phillip', 'Jackson', 'Patrick', 'Thompson', 'cyberporn', 'sites', 'even', 'such', 'perverted', 'ones', 'self-condoned', 'cannibalism', 'website', 'fellow', 'investigator', 'Nigel', 'Matthew', 'Le', 'Nevez', 'Feeders', 'Gainers', 'people', 'who', 'love', 'grotesquely', 'overweight', 'people', 'website', '602', 'pound', 'gainer', 'Deidre', 'played', 'quite', 'well', 'Gabby', 'Millgate', 'feeder', 'Michael', 'Carter', 'also', 'well', 'acted', 'role', 'Alex', ""O'Loughlin"", '.Detective', 'Jackson', 'overboard', 'when', 'feeder', 'attempting', 'kill', 'gainer', 'going', 'so', 'far', 'taking', 'Vegas-style', 'wagers', 'how', 'big', ""'ll"", 'be', 'when', 'taken', 'off', 'case', 'boss', 'plane', 'travels', 'Toledo', 'Ohio', 'USA', 'catch', 'up', 'Michael', 'Carter', 'confront', 'him.What', 'are', 'overdone', 'dramatized', 'scenes', 'confrontation', 'psuedo-psychological', 'supposedly', 'nuggets', 'witty', 'intellectual', 'discourse', 'However', 'even', 'bit', 'good', 'acting', 'great', 'soundtrack', 'ca', ""n't"", 'save', 'film', 'script', 'poor', 'photography', 'over-the-top', 'sensationalism', 'years', 'years', 'kill', 'someone', 'overeating', 'one', 'going', 'be', 'placing', 'Vegas-style', 'bets', 'ending', 'did', 'have', 'nice', 'little', 'twist', 'case', 'decide', 'sit', 'out', 'rest', 'movie.There', 'little', 'bit', 'gore', 'bit', 'nasty', 'fat-melting', 'cannibalism', 'going', 'not', 'enough', 'distract', 'mediocrity', 'film', 'Overall', 'definitely', 'rent', 'buy', 'might', 'even', 'want', 'get', 'rental', 'fee', 'back', 'do', ""n't"", 'recommend', 'movie', 'did', ""n't"", 'live', 'up', 'hype', 'editorial', 'other', 'reviews']",N/A

Basically this film is just another one of those serial killer flicks in the vein of Kiss The Girls/Taking Lives//Bone Collector, take your pick.  Maybe with a dash of Saw as well.  That's why the movie's so....blah.  Outside of a killer with a unique modus operandi, this is pretty by the numbers, and not all that well done I might add.  Tortured detective with baggage of his own?  Check.  Sly, intelligent, philosophical and charming killer?  Check.  Tons of herky-jerky, speed up/slow down MTV style editing that's looked lame since Natural Born Killers?  Got that too.  I do have to give this movie something for managing a feel of ickiness without using much gore.
