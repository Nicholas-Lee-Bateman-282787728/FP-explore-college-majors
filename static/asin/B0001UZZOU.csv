813435,A1GSR7RGCG1QYZ,B0001UZZOU,"A. Gyurisin ""good friend, damn fool""","[10, 22]","After first being introduced to Larry the Cable Guy via the infamously hilarious Blue Collar Comedy Tour film, I was eager to see how this backwoods redneck would do all on his own.  Is his success and humor due in part to the guys that he traveled with in this film, or would this one night of laughs prove to be a miscalculation on Larry's part.  Well, in my humble opinion, it was not his best outing to date.Something enjoyable about his routine on the Blue Collar Comedy DVD is that it is a short, quick-fire routine showcasing some of his talents.  Honestly, if you read my reviews about the two Blue Collar films than you will see that I genuinely found myself laughing at Larry the longest.  His humor seemed raw and perhaps a bit different than what the other three performers had in mind.  He was like the black sheep in these films, yet when given the opportunity to stand on his own, he does not come out a shining star.The first issue that I had with this routine was the repetitive nature of his jokes.  I realize that his catch phrase is ""Git-R-Done"", but I do not believe that one should gather laughter from the audience by telling a joke that bombs, but creates a panic when he yells the phrase ""Git-R-Done"".  It ruined his image to me and showed me that he wasn't willing to pick up the pieces and move ahead, but instead throw in a phrase that had nothing to do with the joke to cover his face.  It was shameful.  Then, to follow suit, he does it again.  He uses more than just the ""Git-R-Done"" phrase to cover up uneventful jokes like his trademark apology and impression of someone suffering from mental retardation.  HA, yep that normally gets a laugh from the audience making fun of others misfortunes ... geez.  Literally, if you wanted to you could count the actual ""jokes"" on one hand in this film due to most of it being nothing more than filler and repetitive humor to bring the audience back from slumber.So, perhaps you can ignore the same joke told over and over and over again, but can you deal with Larry quite possibly criticizing every misfortune that has befallen the people of this great land?  While I am a Democrat, I love to keep an open mind.  I knew Larry was going to be very Southern, very opinionated, but midway during his show (when you could tell he was loosing the audience) I believed him just to be saying things that would gather the attention back to him on stage.  There were moments where the words coming from his mouth nearly made me turn the television off.  The bits about the workers learning English made me want to scream out loud.  I wonder how many languages Larry knows?  It had pushed the envelope too far, and when he didn't think that it went far enough, his calculations would be to throw in a poop joke for even bigger laughter.  If farting didn't exist, Larry the Cable Guy would be out of luck.His comments tried to be jokes, but just came out racist and fearful of the audience that chose to listen.  While I was ready for anything, Larry the Cable Guy provided nothing.  His caged humor on the Blue Collar Comedy Tour was hysterical, but when you open the cage door and let him run free he does not have the self-control or ability complete his sentences and thoughts.  Repetition and crassy, unfunny, childish bathroom humor does not excuse you from telling good jokes.  Apparently, Larry thought otherwise.Overall, I was not impressed.  I was expecting so much from this mock redneck that this comedy album produced a reverse result.  I felt that he was trying to be dicey or racy, but instead (coupled with his repetition and bathroom charm) it actually turned out to be amateur hour at the local bar.  Larry needs new material and a stronger ability to time his ""Git-R-Done"" phrase.  With this in mind, he may return as a very funny comedian, but as of now, I just see him as a petty joke pusher for the clinically redneck.

His is also some of the most inventive stand-up comedy I've heard.I normally won't tolerate bad language and bathroom humor, because it is usually said as the main reason to make one laugh, for some sort of ""shock value""; Larry the Cable Guy says gross toilet humor as part of the story, and it's the story that's funny, not just the way it's said.Some stories are outrageous, but there are many things out of everyday life...Larry ponders whether it's ""Pet Smart"" or Pets Mart"" (I've often had the same thing run through my head) and in telling us of Rosie O'Donnell's  confrontation with NRA member Tom Selleck, he says something I really like: ""if guns kill people, I can blame misspelled words on my pencil"".The show, which was filmed at The State Theatre in Kalamazoo, Michigan, on October 30th, 2003, is 66 minutes long, and the DVD extras include a ""gallery"", and a segment that is about 4 minutes long of ""Bathroom Humor"", actually filmed in a public restroom, with Larry in a stall.The show takes a dip in the middle when he's talking about edible britches, but picks up again and Bubli Bubli's letter is a riot, and the Christmas song finale priceless.
