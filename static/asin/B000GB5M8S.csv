More like an almost scene-by-scene remake of Last House on the Left and is very much inferior to its inspiration.Most Brutal movie ever?  Not even close.  August Underground, Mordum, Man Bites Dog, Murder Set Pieces, I Spit on Your Grave...I can think of dozens more than are way more brutal than Chaos.  OK, slicing off a girl's nipple and force feeding it to her is pretty icky, but not when the effects are shoddy.  Yes, raping a corpse is nasty stuff, but it pales in comparison of the brutality and feeling of disgust and horror when presented with the same material in a movie like Cerda's Aftermath.  Even the original Last House had scenes that were more brutal and unsettling than Chaos, and they didn't have to slice off and cannibalize nipples to do it.Acting is relatively substandard, save for the main bad guy who was played with gusto and noticeable enthusiasm.  Comparatively though, he's no David Hess.  The other bad guys were throwaways- just deranged junkies.  Wes established a lot more characterization and even humanity with the bad guys in LHOTL; we don't learn much about Chaos's baddies apart from, well....they're junkies, they commit atrocities, and once in a while one of them feels a momentary pang of guilt about what's happening, but never acts upon anything.Extras wise, the disc has a few nice additions that wind up spoiled.  The Roger Ebert controversy turns into an essay of defending their film against Ebert's reports against Chaos.  Both sides make valid and invalid points, it's just not that engaging to watch.  And what could have been a great extra in a visit to the LA morgue becomes an exercise in the ludicrous as the director assumes a shirtless WWE wrestler persona while surrounded by real dead bodies.  I don't know if that's the director's real personality or whether he was attempting to make a comedic, ironic statement with the contrast and dark humor, but for me it went over like a house on fire.It's not a pleasant movie by any stretch of the imagination, but neither was it engaging, entertaining or significantly brutal or disturbing like the original LHOTL, or countless other movies that have far better rights to the tagline of ""most brutal movie ever"".  With the hype and the advertising, it's a severe disappointment that is more Shakespeare than Craven when it comes to summing up Chaos: ""a tale told by an idiot....full of sound and fury...signifying nothing"".1 1/2 stars.",2,Poor Last House remake with sensationalistic advertising,1159488000,"09 29, 2006",2006,2542,"['Original', 'story', 'based', 'killings', 'Pee', 'Wee', 'Gaskins', 'described', 'back', 'DVD', 'Nope', 'More', 'almost', 'scene-by-scene', 'remake', 'Last', 'House', 'Left', 'very', 'much', 'inferior', 'inspiration.Most', 'Brutal', 'movie', 'ever', 'Not', 'even', 'close', 'August', 'Underground', 'Mordum', 'Man', 'Bites', 'Dog', 'Murder', 'Set', 'Pieces', 'Spit', 'Your', 'Grave', 'can', 'think', 'dozens', 'more', 'are', 'way', 'more', 'brutal', 'Chaos', 'OK', 'slicing', 'off', 'girl', 'nipple', 'force', 'feeding', 'pretty', 'icky', 'not', 'when', 'effects', 'are', 'shoddy', 'Yes', 'raping', 'corpse', 'nasty', 'stuff', 'comparison', 'brutality', 'feeling', 'disgust', 'horror', 'when', 'presented', 'same', 'material', 'movie', 'Cerda', 'Aftermath', 'Even', 'original', 'Last', 'House', 'had', 'scenes', 'were', 'more', 'brutal', 'unsettling', 'Chaos', 'did', ""n't"", 'have', 'slice', 'off', 'cannibalize', 'nipples', 'do', 'it.Acting', 'relatively', 'substandard', 'save', 'main', 'bad', 'guy', 'who', 'was', 'played', 'gusto', 'noticeable', 'enthusiasm', 'Comparatively', 'David', 'Hess', 'other', 'bad', 'guys', 'were', 'throwaways-', 'just', 'deranged', 'junkies', 'Wes', 'established', 'lot', 'more', 'characterization', 'even', 'humanity', 'bad', 'guys', 'LHOTL', 'do', ""n't"", 'learn', 'much', 'Chaos', 'baddies', 'apart', 'well', '.they', ""'re"", 'junkies', 'commit', 'atrocities', 'once', 'one', 'momentary', 'pang', 'guilt', 'what', 'happening', 'never', 'anything.Extras', 'wise', 'disc', 'few', 'nice', 'additions', 'wind', 'up', 'spoiled', 'Roger', 'Ebert', 'controversy', 'essay', 'defending', 'film', 'Ebert', 'reports', 'Chaos', 'sides', 'make', 'valid', 'invalid', 'points', 'just', 'not', 'engaging', 'watch', 'what', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'great', 'extra', 'visit', 'LA', 'morgue', 'exercise', 'ludicrous', 'director', 'shirtless', 'WWE', 'wrestler', 'persona', 'surrounded', 'real', 'dead', 'bodies', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'director', 'real', 'personality', 'was', 'attempting', 'make', 'comedic', 'ironic', 'statement', 'contrast', 'dark', 'humor', 'went', 'house', 'fire.It', 'not', 'pleasant', 'movie', 'stretch', 'imagination', 'was', 'engaging', 'entertaining', 'significantly', 'brutal', 'disturbing', 'original', 'LHOTL', 'countless', 'other', 'movies', 'have', 'far', 'better', 'rights', 'tagline', 'most', 'brutal', 'movie', 'ever', 'hype', 'advertising', 'severe', 'disappointment', 'more', 'Shakespeare', 'Craven', 'when', 'summing', 'up', 'Chaos', 'tale', 'told', 'idiot', '.full', 'sound', 'fury', 'signifying', 'nothing', '1/2', 'stars']",N/A

Mitchell ""greggmitch""","[7, 11]","Aside from the amateur acting and direction, the bleak, pointless ""plot,"" and the endless, cruel, sadistic, misogynist sexual violence, the most galling thing about CHAOS is director DeFalco's deluded and/or arrogant boast that his film is actually ""based on an original idea"" - when anyone watching the film with a casual knowledge of horror film history will instantly recognize CHAOS for what it really is: an inept remake-cum-rip-off of Wes Craven's classic, ground-breaking, and infinitely more disturbing LAST HOUSE ON THE LEFT, made over 30 years ago!  The only thing CHAOS has going for it is an intense, credible lead performance from Kevin Gage as the leader CHAOS himself - he's truly heartless, evil, and totally convincing, even if the performances by the young girls/victims aren't. Still, it's hard to watch, much less stomach, so much mind-numbing violence directed toward young innocent girls - in particular, there are two very graphic rape/torture/murder scenes that are so stomach-turning, cruel, and just plain mean-spirited that they, depressingly, almost push the envelope in terms of the limits of onscreen taste - almost. But since the film serves no purpose except to shock, nauseate, and give jaded viewers a sick voyeuristic thrill, do we really need to endure much more of this poorly-shot brand of vicious rape, necrophilia, and murder in such unblinking, exploitive, & sleazy fashion?  Does it turn the audience on or off, and does it even matter? Will this cynical horrorshow of sliced & stabbed genitals or endless sobbing/screaming/pleading female victims make CHAOS an underground cult hit because of it? Even if you reach the cop-out climax, it doesn't matter - there's still no reason to support it - esp given the disingenuous ""warning"" that wraps the whole film like a flimsy excuse.

Since you took the time to so painstakingly lambaste the rest of us for our opinions, don't you think that yours should be fair game as well?

This goes well beyond exploitation--of which the best films were always able to view the violence with an ironic wink and a sense of fun--and into unhealthy territory.

1000995,A3N3SN2DDD4HCJ,B000GB5M8S,Robert Blake,"[21, 27]","By now everybody knows that ""Chaos"" is supposedly a violent, unrestrained film. It IS violent, and yet restrained, it's one of those films that promises a lot with it's hype and premise, and in this case delivers something FAR below expectations. You know your production is in trouble when the director is a guy who calls himself ""The Demon,"" in this case David ""The Demon"" DeFalco. Oh DeFalco has spent a lot of time and energy defending the piece as a look at ""real life"" and pure evil blah blah blah, claiming this is the most brutal movie ever made eventhough Mel Gibson's ""The Passion Of The Christ"" outdoes the film in pure blood and violence, DeFalco and his producer have also been waging a childish print and video debate with Roger Ebert who rightfully gave the movie zero stars. At the end of the day what brings ""Chaos"" down isn't the subject matter, but the mere fact that this is pretty poor filmmaking. First there's the look of the movie, it looks like a straight to video production with really simple, pale lighting that doesn't even make the movie look sinister. This really looks more like a first term student film by students still learning to use the equipment. The camera work consists of a few hand held shots and pretty basic framing, nothing too intense. The actors are also very unconvincing, they deliver either performances that come off as too cheesy or too overdone. The biggest problem here though is the script which is so poorly crafted. Characters are cardboard cut-outs with no personality, they merely exist for the purposes of running, grinning, screaming and looking tough or scared. The dialogue is laughable and the story advances with such a choppy, simple rhythm that we can't take any of it seriously. The violence itself only reaches a shocking climax in two scenes, this is not a non-stop orgy of death and killing, in fact, I found the movie to be quite restrained. Oh sure the nipple slicing scene is pretty grotesque, and the final murder in the woods is also birthed from a disturbing use of the imagination, but a more intense, graphic movie would be Meir Zarchi's ""I Spit On Your Grave"" which makes ""Chaos"" look like child's play, or Pasolini's ""Salo"" based on the Marquis De Sade's ""120 Days Of Sodom."" DeFalco also needs to be a little more original, movie buffs are already signaling out all the obvious ""Last House On The Left"" rip-offs present in the movie. I see the film more as one of those cheesy attempts by a guy who thinks he's tapped into reality at trying to make ""something real"" when in fact it doesn't feel real at all. Evil is a topic best looked at when it's done with a balanced blend of violence and psychology as in ""The Silence Of The Lambs,"" ""Seven,"" ""The Exorcist,"" and horror works best when it is attempted with a real sense of the disturbing and gritty as with the original ""Texas Chainsaw Massacre."" ""Chaos"" is more of a geek show, with scenes of pain, breasts and slobbering villains in a B-movie setting. This is not the most brutal movie ever made, or one of the best, or one worth checking out.",1,"Poorly-Made, Very Weak Writing.",1160092800,"10 6, 2006",2006,3081,"['now', 'everybody', 'Chaos', 'supposedly', 'violent', 'unrestrained', 'film', 'violent', 'yet', 'restrained', 'one', 'films', 'lot', 'hype', 'premise', 'case', 'something', 'FAR', 'expectations', 'know', 'production', 'trouble', 'when', 'director', 'guy', 'who', 'Demon', 'case', 'David', 'Demon', 'DeFalco', 'Oh', 'DeFalco', 'spent', 'lot', 'time', 'energy', 'defending', 'piece', 'look', 'real', 'life', 'pure', 'evil', 'blah', 'blah', 'blah', 'claiming', 'most', 'brutal', 'movie', 'ever', 'made', 'eventhough', 'Mel', 'Gibson', 'Passion', 'Christ', 'film', 'pure', 'blood', 'violence', 'DeFalco', 'producer', 'have', 'also', 'been', 'waging', 'childish', 'print', 'video', 'debate', 'Roger', 'Ebert', 'who', 'rightfully', 'gave', 'movie', 'zero', 'stars', 'end', 'day', 'what', 'Chaos', 'down', ""n't"", 'subject', 'matter', 'mere', 'fact', 'pretty', 'poor', 'filmmaking', 'First', 'look', 'movie', 'straight', 'video', 'production', 'really', 'simple', 'pale', 'lighting', ""n't"", 'even', 'make', 'movie', 'look', 'sinister', 'really', 'more', 'first', 'term', 'student', 'film', 'students', 'still', 'learning', 'use', 'equipment', 'camera', 'work', 'few', 'hand', 'held', 'shots', 'pretty', 'basic', 'framing', 'nothing', 'too', 'intense', 'actors', 'are', 'also', 'very', 'unconvincing', 'deliver', 'performances', 'come', 'off', 'too', 'cheesy', 'too', 'overdone', 'biggest', 'problem', 'here', 'script', 'so', 'poorly', 'crafted', 'Characters', 'are', 'cardboard', 'cut-outs', 'personality', 'merely', 'exist', 'purposes', 'running', 'grinning', 'screaming', 'looking', 'tough', 'scared', 'dialogue', 'laughable', 'story', 'advances', 'choppy', 'simple', 'rhythm', 'ca', ""n't"", 'take', 'seriously', 'violence', 'only', 'shocking', 'climax', 'two', 'scenes', 'not', 'non-stop', 'orgy', 'death', 'killing', 'fact', 'found', 'movie', 'be', 'quite', 'restrained', 'Oh', 'sure', 'nipple', 'slicing', 'scene', 'pretty', 'grotesque', 'final', 'murder', 'woods', 'also', 'birthed', 'disturbing', 'use', 'imagination', 'more', 'intense', 'graphic', 'movie', 'would', 'be', 'Meir', 'Zarchi', 'Spit', 'Your', 'Grave', 'Chaos', 'look', 'child', 'play', 'Pasolini', 'Salo', 'based', 'Marquis', 'De', 'Sade', '120', 'Days', 'Sodom', 'DeFalco', 'also', 'be', 'little', 'more', 'original', 'movie', 'buffs', 'are', 'already', 'signaling', 'out', 'obvious', 'Last', 'House', 'Left', 'rip-offs', 'present', 'movie', 'see', 'film', 'more', 'one', 'cheesy', 'attempts', 'guy', 'who', 'tapped', 'reality', 'trying', 'make', 'something', 'real', 'when', 'fact', ""n't"", 'feel', 'real', 'Evil', 'topic', 'best', 'looked', 'when', 'done', 'balanced', 'blend', 'violence', 'psychology', 'Silence', 'Lambs', 'Seven', 'Exorcist', 'horror', 'works', 'best', 'when', 'attempted', 'real', 'sense', 'disturbing', 'gritty', 'original', 'Texas', 'Chainsaw', 'Massacre', 'Chaos', 'more', 'geek', 'show', 'scenes', 'pain', 'breasts', 'slobbering', 'villains', 'B-movie', 'setting', 'not', 'most', 'brutal', 'movie', 'ever', 'made', 'one', 'best', 'one', 'worth', 'checking', 'out']",N/A

This movie clearly was a rip off of Last House on the Left and countless other movie's. I am not rating it on it's violence because I could care less about violence in movies because I know people are acting and it's not real, so fiction does not get to me in the way everybody is screaming about how this movie is harsh and evil. The worst thing to happen to horror movie's or movies in general is the MPAA because they chop movies up and they choose what we should see, which is one more thing of control. My problem's with this movie is, there was some major bad acting in spots. You could clearly tell the fake crying at spots. And yes these dumb bitch's go off with some guy they don't know into the middle of the woods and they don't expect nothing to happen. The shot with the father running in with the chainsaw, there was no pause he had to do what he had to do, and then moments later the most stupid thing happened, he hisatated on the man that was the ring leader Chaos, he just sliced with a chainsaw and now wont finish it, that to me was the biggest mistake, it should have been wrote diffrent he should have went through with it or he should not have had the gun. Every one is talking about this over violence in this movie, half of it was off screen, all you really saw was blood, screaming and the imagination of the mind in what they where doing. The ending was so far over the top that to me it reminded me of a corny 1970's movie. I don't really care if the bad guy win's or lose's what I do care about is the reality in movie's and a belivable outcome when you start something you should end with reality, the whole hisatation part the shoot out at the bar western style of an ending made no sense to me because the movie was strong in moments and then went the typical route of oh yeah that was coming.

1000997,ALH8OD35DMXFK,B000GB5M8S,Sirand,"[15, 21]","Note to filmmakers: You can't manufacture controversy.CHAOS is a movie made with all hyperbole and no talent.

In fact, it's nothing more than a rip-off of Wes Craven's grindhouse classic, LAST HOUSE ON THE LEFT.

1000998,A145B8OHVNNFAJ,B000GB5M8S,Steward Willons,"[13, 21]","Dave DeFalco, the ""director"", should be charged with plagiarism. This film is essentially Last House on the Left without the power, wit, and intellect of its inspiration. A number of people have tried to remake Last House on the Left including Night Train Murders, but they each fail because they mistakenly think Last House is moving simply because of its graphic violence. They miss the subtleties that make Wes Craven's movie effective.This is movie is trash, plain and simple. I love bad movies - Herschell Gordon Lewis in particular made some terrible, fun, and frequently hilarious movies, but they didn't take themselves too seriously. When he was making Blood Feast or Wizard of Gore, he KNEW he was making cheesy camp - that's why those movies are so great. I also love extreme movies. Irreversible and The Piano Teacher are two of the most extreme films around dealing with difficult subject matter in a very thoughtful, intriguing way. They don't cross into exploitation because they rely on ideas, not simply a string of graphic violence or perversion. Chaos attempts to be a serious film and thus fails on the camp scale. It sometimes tries to act as though it has a point, a message if you will, but no - it's really about the torture and rape and the directors know it.In an unprecedented move, the directors provide a featurette to basically say ""our movie doesn't suck!"" I've never seen such posturing from a couple of hacks. They put up the flimsiest, stupidest arguments imaginable. The funny thing is that they're so serious when they're defending their move. The simple fact that they feel the need to defend it speaks volumes. A work of art speaks for itself.The movie is technically decent. The shots are in focus, the sound is fine, the color is ok. It's filmed in a very simple, point-the-camera-at-the-action style. Some of the actors are decent. The parents seem like they know what they're doing and they're actually the best part of the movie until the idiotic script requires the wife to suddenly become hysterical and useless. The script is just as dumb as can be. It serves the lowest level of basic communication possible. The lead character is creatively named Chaos, like the movie title. Clever.I wouldn't mind the graphic violence if it had a point. Irreversible is extremely graphic during the club scene and then again during the rape in the tunnel, but it's filmed in an artistic manner, keeping a respectful distance. You can tell immediately that Chaos is exploitation from the way the camera gleefully lingers on the carnage. When the first girl is being attack in the woods, the camera does one of those slow pans across her body making it look ""appealing"" if you can ignore the things being done to it. The point of the scene should be the horror against humanity, not ""isn't it cool that she's naked?"" I don't mind extremely graphic violence, but to present it such a humorless, pointless, exploitative manner is pretty reprehensible.That said, it IS the sickest film I've ever seen (and I've seen them all). Last House on Dead End Street, which is supposed to be tantamount to snuff has nothing on this. If all you want is a high ""yuck factor"", this ought to do it. Perhaps Pasolini's Salo has a more prolonged type of violence and perversion, but it never crosses the line as Chaos does. Again, I welcome filmmakers to go to extremes, but graphic violence for the sake of graphic violence is meaningless.Some critics have mistakenly called the film ""effective"". I challenge that the film is too stupid to be effective. There are too many distractions. One minute you're marveling at how uncreative the script is, the next minute you're wondering how someone could rip off Last House so thoroughly. In order for a film to be effective, we should probably care about the characters. The two girls are so stupid in their actions and so annoying with their constant screaming that it becomes hard to care about them. Besides that, we know they're rape/murder fodder from the beginning. They never have a chance and, since we know how it will end because it follows the formula so exactly, we can't connect with them at all. Their purpose is not to develop, change, or learn a lesson - their purpose is to be killed in the woods.Finally, this brings us to the ""message"". The film begins with a statement from the director informing us that this is a cautionary tale, a public service if you will. What's the message? If you're so stupid as to follow some strange guy deep into the woods to buy drugs from his buddies that you get killed? What teenage girl doesn't know that? I wonder who the audience is. According to the statement of purpose, the target audience is clearly young women. How many young women do you think decided to go to this film? Now, how many young men do you think went to this? For a film supposedly targeted at a female audience for the purpose of ""warning"" them about the dangers of bad people, it sure seems aimed at the male audience. Do the filmmakers really think women really want lingering shots of a dying woman's breasts? There can be no possible explanation except that it's an appeal to the (secret) intended audience of men. Don't believe what the filmmakers say - it's not a cautionary tale, it's a glorification of brutal violence and extreme cruelty.I would avoid this DVD at all costs. These guys really don't deserve your money. If you're curious, rent this from Netflix or something. Chances are you won't be in the mood for it again for a while anyway. As a musician/composer, I tend to give artists the benefit of the doubt. I believe that most artists set out to make a quality work with the best intentions (whether these intentions are realized is quite another manner). However, I don't feel that was the case here. I think two talentless people decided to make a truly awful film. Don't support them by buying this DVD. I know many will be curious to see what could possibly be so terrible. There is no replay value whatsoever.
