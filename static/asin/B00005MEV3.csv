Hollywood has been busting a gut for years trying to get Julia Styles a big hit, and this was one of her prep efforts.  Stiles plays a rebellious teenager.  A very rebellious teenager.  So bad, in fact, that we are led to believe that she murders her mother to win over the affections of her father.  Or did she?That's the puzzle throughout the movie.  It's the reason it almost gets a higher rating, but because of the way it was handled, it stays in one-star territory.  The movie does try to be ambitious by showing her taking over ALL the roles of her mother.  And when dad marries the maid that was fired by her mother, boy does Julia get jealous!All of this could have been elevated to the level of great trash, but unfortunately the plot and direction fall off quickly.  With mom offed rather quickly, you're hoping to at least see a few more people get knocked off, especially an irritating neighbor who keeps putting her nose into everybody's business.  But even this falls short.  Finally, we have one of those endings that are supposed to make us look at what we've seen completely differently.  Is someone else responsible for mom's demise?  Or is this person just taking over the family wickedness.

She is a very seductive teenager and we find out later that she went all the way with her own father almost immediately after the mother was bludgeoned to death.  And it's not like the father forces the issue. Rather she tries to become the mother.  It's very strange.Is the idea really that the father had been molesting her for years ?  I don't know.  That's one possible interpretation.She spends most of the movie running around in skimpy clothes.The story itself is completely rediculous so if you want to watch a movie that is even remotely possible forget it.But sometimes people like to watch movies just for fun so in that case you may enjoy it.  Even though the story itself isn't realistic the human emotions are.To tell you the truth I'm still not sure what is going on with this movie.  If the ending means what I think it does that makes it even more rediculous.For one thing what the ending implies would not even be physically possible.There's only about 10 main characters in the entire movie and by the end about half of them are dead so you start to run out of possible candidates for who the villain really is.Jeff MarzanoDamageInto the FireThe Seduction ~ Morgan Fairchild, Michael Sarrazin, Vince Edwards, and Andrew Stevens (DVD - 2006)",3,Very Dark Story,1197331200,"12 11, 2007",2007,1415,"['watched', 'movie', 'LMN', 'network', 'so', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'dvd', 'figured', ""'d"", 'write', 'review.I', 'gave', '3', 'stars', 'mainly', 'gorgeous', 'main', 'character', 'very', 'seductive', 'teenager', 'find', 'out', 'later', 'went', 'way', 'own', 'father', 'almost', 'immediately', 'mother', 'was', 'bludgeoned', 'death', 'not', 'father', 'issue', 'become', 'mother', 'very', 'strange.Is', 'idea', 'really', 'father', 'had', 'been', 'molesting', 'years', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'one', 'possible', 'interpretation.She', 'most', 'movie', 'running', 'around', 'skimpy', 'clothes.The', 'story', 'completely', 'rediculous', 'so', 'want', 'watch', 'movie', 'even', 'remotely', 'possible', 'forget', 'it.But', 'sometimes', 'people', 'watch', 'movies', 'just', 'fun', 'so', 'case', 'may', 'enjoy', 'Even', 'story', ""n't"", 'realistic', 'human', 'emotions', 'are.To', 'tell', 'truth', ""'m"", 'still', 'not', 'sure', 'what', 'going', 'movie', 'ending', 'what', 'think', 'even', 'more', 'rediculous.For', 'one', 'thing', 'what', 'ending', 'implies', 'would', 'not', 'even', 'be', 'physically', 'only', 'about', '10', 'main', 'characters', 'entire', 'movie', 'end', 'half', 'are', 'dead', 'start', 'run', 'out', 'possible', 'candidates', 'who', 'villain', 'really', 'is.Jeff', 'MarzanoDamageInto', 'FireThe', 'Seduction', '~', 'Morgan', 'Fairchild', 'Michael', 'Sarrazin', 'Vince', 'Edwards', 'Andrew', 'Stevens', 'DVD', '2006']",N/A

This was one of her first rolls and it was a direct-to-video semi-hit back in 1998. It's an amazing film and watching it last night, I had to write this review.WICKED is a movie where nothing is what it seems.14-year-old Ellie Christianson (Julia Stiles) lives to run away. In fact, she has a suitcase just for that. She never does, always giving up her fight. She always fights with her mother Karen Christianson (Chelsea Field) who's having an affair with deadbeat loser neighbor Lawson Smith (Patrick Muldoon). She seems to only get along with her dad, Ben (Billy Moses) and little sister, Inger (Vanessa Zima). One day, Karen is bludgen to death with a mask (part of the comedy and tragety masks) in her own home, in a gated community. All fingers point to Ellie who never liked her mother much and is always getting into trouble. Ellie was always the Daddy's Girl and a confessed favorite of her father's. So she decides to take over where her mother left off, wearing her clothes and cooking for her family. After she seduces her father, she thinks that they will be together forever. But when former maid Lena Anderson (Louise Myrback) decides marry Ben to get her green card, Ellie gets the idea that she should try to run away again....The review seems short but I can't write much without giving anything away.WICKED is a very visual movie. Spetacular colors are used in several scenes. Before the murder, everything around the house is completly white.

The plot will keep you guessing until just about the end...and that is the best I can say.Now, for my blast at the rating...The movie is rated ""R"".  The opening pre-credit says, ""contains explicit sexuality"".  When I'm warned about something, I expect to see it.  There isn't so much as a nude scene in this film.

The story revolves around JUlia Styles as a bratty teen.  SHe hates her Mother (and the Mother Hates Her) HEr sister gets everything she wants, and they have a nanny who is a little to perky.  Her only sanctuary is when her father comes home in which case she is in some form of paradise.Teh story begins when the father returns home from another business trip.  He brings gifts and for JUlia it's a make-up kit.  She loves it.  She tries it out, and does a surprisngly good job of it but the mother won't allow it.  Ironically enough the mother ends up dead later that morning.  You pretty much guess she did it but one would possibly lose an idea or two in the crime scene.After that JUlia starts to change.  She becomes more like her mother and it goes way to far, until the very wicked ending that you would not have guessed (trust me).IT's obviouse that people who see this will brush it off.  DOn't.

I expected ""Wicked"" to be a cheesy B-movie, and it is.  However, it's a good one at that; I thoroughly enjoyed myself.""Wicked""'s main plot revoles around a highly dysfunctional family in that morass we call the American Suburbia.  The mother is mysteriously murdered one morning, and there are a variety of suspects like a good B-level whodunit movie, with even a cheesy detective included.  However, as the father's oldest daughter begins to reveal the true depth of her obsession with her father by gradually seeking to replace her deceased mother, the murder because somewhat of a sideshow.Julia Stiles smoulders like never before as the &uuml;ber-sultry, forbidden jailbait sex-goddess obsessed with her father.  She eerily dons her mother's gowns, cooks for her father, and eventually seduces him (who could resist?  Honestly?)  Eventually Ellie (Stiles) becomes increasingly more obsessed and evil as she gets into a power struggle with Lena, her father's new girlfriend.  Julia Stile's performance, and the unfolding of the plot, is both grandly disturbing and breathlessly exciting to watch.  The movie leaves you feeling very uneasy.  The director obviously tried to go for a more dark comedy tone, but I was just disturbed period....",4,Must-see for Julia Styles fans,1073260800,"01 5, 2004",2004,1402,"['admit', 'only', 'reason', 'rented', 'movie', 'was', 'Julia', 'Stiles', 'picture', 'back', 'DVD', 'cover', 'looking', 'unspeakably', 'sultry', 'irresistible', 'expected', 'Wicked', 'be', 'cheesy', 'B-movie', 'However', 'good', 'one', 'thoroughly', 'enjoyed', 'Wicked', 'main', 'plot', 'revoles', 'highly', 'dysfunctional', 'family', 'morass', 'call', 'American', 'Suburbia', 'mother', 'mysteriously', 'murdered', 'one', 'morning', 'are', 'variety', 'suspects', 'good', 'B-level', 'whodunit', 'movie', 'even', 'cheesy', 'detective', 'included', 'However', 'father', 'oldest', 'daughter', 'reveal', 'true', 'depth', 'obsession', 'father', 'gradually', 'seeking', 'replace', 'deceased', 'mother', 'murder', 'somewhat', 'sideshow.Julia', 'Stiles', 'smoulders', 'never', 'uuml', 'ber-sultry', 'forbidden', 'jailbait', 'sex-goddess', 'obsessed', 'father', 'eerily', 'dons', 'mother', 'gowns', 'cooks', 'father', 'eventually', 'who', 'could', 'resist', 'Honestly', 'Eventually', 'Ellie', 'Stiles', 'increasingly', 'more', 'obsessed', 'evil', 'power', 'struggle', 'Lena', 'father', 'new', 'girlfriend', 'Julia', 'Stile', 'performance', 'unfolding', 'plot', 'grandly', 'disturbing', 'breathlessly', 'exciting', 'watch', 'movie', 'feeling', 'very', 'uneasy', 'director', 'obviously', 'tried', 'go', 'more', 'dark', 'comedy', 'tone', 'was', 'just', 'disturbed', 'period']",N/A
