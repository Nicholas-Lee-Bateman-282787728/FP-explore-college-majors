When I watch Northern Exposure, I think of what the poet Terrence said - ""I am a man. Nothing human is alien to me"". Well that is this show.It's all about this experience we are all going through. What it means to be human. Mankind in its diverse shades co-existing on this all too large blue marble in the sky.Northern Exposure gave me so many moments of pause, of joy, of smiling sadness, of deep thought, that I know and feel that I am a better person because of it. In this age where it seems everything conspires to tear us all apart, to isolate us, to scare us, where small town community is portrayed in post-apocalyptic shows like Jericho (highly recommended viewing by the way),and Mother Nature has us all on the run, that somewhere beyond the sea, and over the rainbow, North to Alaska, is Cicely, waiting to be found, visited, explored, and loved over and over again. It reminds us that we are supposed to be a community, and not isolated technology worshippers, locked away, in our sterile and efficient apartments/houses.So hug your neighbor!!Now if you'll excuse me. I'm going to hit the Brick.Adam is cooking. Holling is pouring. The beer is flowing like wine.Cheers to you all and long live Jessie the Bear!PS - And yes, this is the weakest season of Northern Exposure. Its kinda like all the turmoil of the 21st century came early to our beloved town. The season, in some ways, was just not congruent with the overall theme of show and the characters acted, well, out of character. David Chase does deserve a minor pummeling. But still, it is the greatest television show to grace the waves and most likely they'll be watching it in a 100 years!",5,What It Means to Be Human ...,1186617600,"08 9, 2007",2007,1852,"['something', 'show', 'physical', 'emotional', 'spiritual', 'level', 'nothing', 'else', 'currently', 'television', 'even', 'matter', 'modern', 'literature', 'When', 'watch', 'Northern', 'Exposure', 'think', 'what', 'poet', 'Terrence', 'said', 'am', 'man', 'Nothing', 'human', 'alien', 'Well', 'show.It', 'experience', 'are', 'going', 'What', 'be', 'human', 'Mankind', 'diverse', 'shades', 'co-existing', 'too', 'large', 'blue', 'marble', 'sky.Northern', 'Exposure', 'gave', 'so', 'many', 'moments', 'pause', 'joy', 'smiling', 'sadness', 'deep', 'thought', 'know', 'feel', 'am', 'better', 'person', 'age', 'where', 'everything', 'conspires', 'tear', 'apart', 'isolate', 'scare', 'where', 'small', 'town', 'community', 'portrayed', 'post-apocalyptic', 'shows', 'Jericho', 'highly', 'recommended', 'viewing', 'way', 'Mother', 'Nature', 'run', 'somewhere', 'sea', 'rainbow', 'North', 'Alaska', 'Cicely', 'waiting', 'be', 'found', 'visited', 'explored', 'loved', 'over', 'over', 'again', 'are', 'supposed', 'be', 'community', 'not', 'isolated', 'technology', 'worshippers', 'locked', 'away', 'sterile', 'efficient', 'apartments/houses.So', 'hug', 'neighbor', 'Now', ""'ll"", 'excuse', ""'m"", 'going', 'hit', 'Brick.Adam', 'cooking', 'Holling', 'pouring', 'beer', 'flowing', 'wine.Cheers', 'long', 'live', 'Jessie', 'Bear', 'PS', 'yes', 'weakest', 'season', 'Northern', 'Exposure', 'kinda', 'turmoil', '21st', 'century', 'came', 'early', 'beloved', 'town', 'season', 'ways', 'was', 'just', 'not', 'congruent', 'overall', 'theme', 'show', 'characters', 'acted', 'well', 'character', 'David', 'Chase', 'deserve', 'minor', 'pummeling', 'still', 'greatest', 'television', 'show', 'grace', 'waves', 'most', 'likely', ""'ll"", 'be', 'watching', '100', 'years']",Northern Exposure: The Complete Sixth Season

I actually thought the first half of this season was pretty damn good, and disagree with the notion that Morrow's character was just going through the motions. I think the show gave a good ending for Joel. I think the show could also have gone on without him... but I think they tried so hard to replace Joel by introducing a new ""out of town doctor"" that it came across as grasping for story lines. Going on without Joel or a new doctor, and maybe gradually introducing new character(s), I think the show could've worked for a while longer at least. By trying to replicate the original formula of the show rather than trying something truly new, it just seemed like self-parody. I try to just pretend that the series ended when Joel left. The new doctor and his wife were a massive shark jump. That said the first half of season 6 was great and I look forward to watching it again... and perhaps after all these years, I'll even look on the last half of the season in a more positive light.I just wish the show was still around with its mid/late-series energy.

For my money Northern Exposure is the second greatest TV series in the history of the medium, second only to The Fugitive.I avoided watching the final season due to the dreadful comments of many Amazon reviewers but I finally gave in... and I'm sorry I did.There are many specific problems and one that's more ethereal.First, replacing Dr. Fleischman with another doctor whose attitudes, inability to adjust and general whininess exactly mirror his predecessor was a foolish move. It's hard to imagine the creative team who gave birth to this brilliant show making this decision - it reeks of one mandated by clueless studio executives.Second, Paul Provenza as the new doctor and whoever as his wife, under the blanket of a dead script, create characters who could put a speed freak to sleep. Dull as dishwater and at times immensely aggravating.Third, the entire cast seems to have had the wind taken out of their sails. Many are walking through their roles. Marilyn's usual stoney simplicity which for five seasons was cleverly rendered and at time hilarious in the final season now becomes shockingly boring. Too often season six has what the others never did - BAD acting.Fourth, the reliance on fantasy, dreams, illusions, etc. is wildly overworked. The season opener's recasting of the characters in New York is clever and it entertains. But let's drop it there, please. Watching Provenza at one point turn into a werewolf while his wife serves him dinner is beyond painful. It's not clever. It's stupid.The harder to pin down problem is that the magic is gone. The indescribable mix of sharp writing and quirky charm that makes Northern Exposure so unique is entirely absent. One always had the feeling that the characters loved each other. There's no love in these scripts.If you feel like I do that there was always some fairy dust sprinkled on the streets of Cicely... you'll find that every bit of that dust has blown away...",2,"Sad, a Crash Landing",1205798400,"03 18, 2008",2008,2074,"['Never', 'having', 'watched', 'show', 'when', 'originally', 'aired', 'became', 'entirely', 'addicted', 'DVD', 'sets', 'have', 'blissfully', 'devoured', 'money', 'Northern', 'Exposure', 'second', 'greatest', 'TV', 'series', 'history', 'medium', 'second', 'only', 'Fugitive.I', 'avoided', 'watching', 'final', 'season', 'due', 'dreadful', 'comments', 'many', 'Amazon', 'reviewers', 'finally', 'gave', ""'m"", 'sorry', 'are', 'many', 'specific', 'problems', 'one', 'more', 'ethereal.First', 'replacing', 'Dr.', 'Fleischman', 'doctor', 'attitudes', 'inability', 'adjust', 'general', 'whininess', 'exactly', 'mirror', 'predecessor', 'was', 'foolish', 'move', 'hard', 'imagine', 'creative', 'team', 'who', 'gave', 'birth', 'brilliant', 'show', 'making', 'decision', 'one', 'mandated', 'clueless', 'studio', 'executives.Second', 'Paul', 'Provenza', 'new', 'doctor', 'whoever', 'wife', 'blanket', 'dead', 'script', 'create', 'characters', 'who', 'could', 'put', 'speed', 'freak', 'sleep', 'Dull', 'dishwater', 'times', 'immensely', 'aggravating.Third', 'entire', 'cast', 'have', 'had', 'wind', 'taken', 'sails', 'Many', 'are', 'walking', 'roles', 'Marilyn', 'usual', 'stoney', 'simplicity', 'five', 'seasons', 'was', 'cleverly', 'rendered', 'time', 'hilarious', 'final', 'season', 'now', 'shockingly', 'boring', 'Too', 'often', 'season', 'six', 'what', 'others', 'never', 'did', 'BAD', 'acting.Fourth', 'reliance', 'fantasy', 'dreams', 'illusions', 'etc', 'wildly', 'overworked', 'season', 'opener', 'recasting', 'characters', 'New', 'York', 'clever', 'let', 'drop', 'there', 'please', 'Watching', 'Provenza', 'one', 'point', 'turn', 'werewolf', 'wife', 'dinner', 'painful', 'not', 'clever', 'stupid.The', 'harder', 'pin', 'down', 'problem', 'magic', 'gone', 'indescribable', 'mix', 'sharp', 'writing', 'quirky', 'charm', 'Northern', 'Exposure', 'unique', 'entirely', 'absent', 'One', 'always', 'had', 'feeling', 'characters', 'loved', 'other', 'love', 'scripts.If', 'feel', 'do', 'was', 'always', 'fairy', 'dust', 'sprinkled', 'streets', 'Cicely', ""'ll"", 'find', 'bit', 'dust', 'blown', 'away']",Northern Exposure: The Complete Sixth Season

Joel becomes rather likeable, the new doctor and his wife are good enough characters that you don't miss Fleishmann as-doctor;  but, there seems to be some need to marry-off Maggie, which with Joel in serious fade out, leaves her flirting around with Chris, the D.J., which didn't work for me.

The new doctor's wife gets a pretty good feature spot in the ""plot"", and an old guest character returns to delight the viewer.

We had just gotten to know the Capras, with Dr. Phil in some amusing episodes like ""Little Italy,"" where he smells a pasta sauce only his dear Aunt Jemima could have made, only to discover a vibrant Italian community in Cicely, even if it found itself at odds with each other.  Joel finally loses himself in the wilderness.  It wasn't completely convincing but it was fun just the same, especially when Marilyn shows up for a potlatch, discovering that he still hadn't lost his ego.  Some episodes where complete throwaways such as the amusing episode in which Marilyn recounts a tale of a relative who may have foiled a treaty between Lenin and the surviving Romanov family, giving the cast another opportunity to play dress-up.  However, you know the show is winding down when recurrent characters make their curtain call such as Adam in ""The Quest,"" and Cal, who manages to tug at Officer Semanksi's heartstings in ""Let's Dance."" Even Rabbi Schulman makes one more call, discovering Michelle lost in the woods in the final episode.  Joel bids an earlier adieu in a fascinating dream sequence in ""The Quest.""

I was irritated by the addition of characters who didn't move the main story line along. It was worse than in the fifth season. This season felt like a bunch of side stories that would have been interesting to know but only after completing the main story. I was left feeling like the main story fell off the tracks and was only giving a half-hearted attempt to get back on-track.Remember that I said I was moved by several scenes and enjoyed a few of the episodes?

1040486,A1D1MIFRSG50Y3,B000LSAJ5M,Mike S.,"[0, 0]","The 6th season of Northern Exposure is kind of all over the place.  The real-life contract situation between Rob Morrow and the show's producers had finally come to a head, and he announced that he would not be renewing his contract.  Because however, the first two seasons of the show were partial seasons, Morrow had to appear in some of the 6th season episodes.  So they slowly started writing him out of the series with his final episode being in the 15th episode of the season called The Quest.  It was probably, along with the season premier which showed an alternate life for the characters in NY (which was totally stolen by Cynthia Geary's performance ditching the bubble-headed valley-girl version of Shelly), was the best of the season.  Fleischman finally makes his way back to NY in a very unconventional manner.  And it also had a cameo by Adam Arkin reprising his role as Chef/CIA agent Adam.Midway through the season the show introduced the new town doctor , Phil Capra (Paul Provenza) and his wife Michelle (played by Teri Polo) who come to town after  Dr. Fleischman heads even deeper into the wilderness.  They were first introduced as wanting to be there after leaving LA, and when that did not seem to work, the writers had the characters having trouble adjusting to the town so they would hate it one episode and then seemed to kind of like it again in the next.  I think the plan was to  carry on  the show without Rob Morrow, but as they were writing him out of the show and he essentially became a recurring character, they were trying to get any storyline to work (including a possible romance between  Maggie  and Chris that felt kind of forced), that the show ended up sputtering out.One of the other reviewers compared it to MASH and I think even a comparison to  ER can be made, where stars in ensemble cast shows were replaced and survived.  But unlike ER where the show never centered around any particular character, the first two seasons of Northern Exposure were built around the fish-out-of-water aspect of the NY doctor in rural Alaska.  Then it became how he was adjusting and growing into being a member of the quirky little town.  And so Fleischman's exit from Northern Exposure was much more akin to what MASH would have been losing Hawkeye had Alan Alda decided to leave, which would have killed that show.  The actual series finalie was a letdown because it seemed like just another episode (and even then Maggie never even appeared until the last couple minutes) until the very ending montage which did send the show out on a nice note.  And luckily Universal actually paid for the rights to keep the song Our Town in there, because it would not have worked nearly as well as with dubbed over elevator music.Obviously the music issue still rears its head in this season.  Some, but not all, of the original songs are missing.  So, if that bothers you from seasons 3-5, then it will bother you about this one as well.  As far as DVD extras go, there are deleted scenes on each disc.  About 40 minutes worth in all.  No gag reels this time, and still no commentary tracks or behind the scenes material.All in all I would characterize this season as good, but not great.  Certainly not as good as the first few seasons.  It has moments of quality, but was essentially lost trying to find its footing again after Morrow's departure until it because clear that a show without him was just never going to work.  Unfortunately the show did not have the kind of ending that it really should have, but with that said I did really like Rob Morrow's final episode (although it would have been better having him interact with more of the town's characters even if just through dream sequences) and thought the way he returned to NY was very fitting for the show.",3,A disjointed end to the series,1404000000,"06 29, 2014",2014,3794,"['6th', 'season', 'Northern', 'Exposure', 'kind', 'place', 'real-life', 'contract', 'situation', 'Rob', 'Morrow', 'show', 'producers', 'had', 'finally', 'come', 'head', 'announced', 'would', 'not', 'be', 'renewing', 'contract', 'however', 'first', 'two', 'seasons', 'show', 'were', 'partial', 'seasons', 'Morrow', 'had', 'appear', '6th', 'season', 'episodes', 'slowly', 'started', 'writing', 'series', 'final', 'episode', 'being', '15th', 'episode', 'season', 'called', 'Quest', 'was', 'probably', 'season', 'premier', 'showed', 'alternate', 'life', 'characters', 'NY', 'was', 'totally', 'stolen', 'Cynthia', 'Geary', 'performance', 'ditching', 'bubble-headed', 'valley-girl', 'version', 'Shelly', 'was', 'best', 'season', 'Fleischman', 'finally', 'way', 'back', 'NY', 'very', 'unconventional', 'manner', 'also', 'had', 'cameo', 'Adam', 'Arkin', 'reprising', 'role', 'Chef/CIA', 'agent', 'Adam.Midway', 'season', 'show', 'introduced', 'new', 'town', 'doctor', 'Phil', 'Capra', 'Paul', 'Provenza', 'wife', 'Michelle', 'played', 'Teri', 'Polo', 'who', 'come', 'town', 'Dr.', 'Fleischman', 'heads', 'even', 'deeper', 'wilderness', 'were', 'first', 'introduced', 'wanting', 'be', 'there', 'leaving', 'LA', 'when', 'did', 'not', 'seem', 'work', 'writers', 'had', 'characters', 'having', 'trouble', 'adjusting', 'town', 'would', 'hate', 'one', 'episode', 'then', 'seemed', 'kind', 'again', 'next', 'think', 'plan', 'was', 'carry', 'show', 'Rob', 'Morrow', 'were', 'writing', 'show', 'essentially', 'became', 'recurring', 'character', 'were', 'trying', 'get', 'storyline', 'work', 'including', 'possible', 'romance', 'Maggie', 'Chris', 'felt', 'kind', 'forced', 'show', 'ended', 'up', 'sputtering', 'out.One', 'other', 'reviewers', 'compared', 'MASH', 'think', 'even', 'comparison', 'ER', 'can', 'be', 'made', 'where', 'stars', 'ensemble', 'cast', 'shows', 'were', 'replaced', 'survived', 'ER', 'where', 'show', 'never', 'centered', 'particular', 'character', 'first', 'two', 'seasons', 'Northern', 'Exposure', 'were', 'built', 'fish-out-of-water', 'aspect', 'NY', 'doctor', 'rural', 'Alaska', 'Then', 'became', 'how', 'was', 'adjusting', 'growing', 'being', 'member', 'quirky', 'little', 'town', 'so', 'Fleischman', 'exit', 'Northern', 'Exposure', 'was', 'much', 'more', 'akin', 'what', 'MASH', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'losing', 'Hawkeye', 'had', 'Alan', 'Alda', 'decided', 'leave', 'would', 'have', 'killed', 'show', 'actual', 'series', 'finalie', 'was', 'letdown', 'seemed', 'like', 'just', 'episode', 'even', 'then', 'Maggie', 'never', 'even', 'appeared', 'last', 'couple', 'minutes', 'very', 'ending', 'montage', 'did', 'send', 'show', 'out', 'nice', 'note', 'luckily', 'Universal', 'actually', 'paid', 'rights', 'keep', 'song', 'Town', 'there', 'would', 'not', 'have', 'worked', 'nearly', 'as', 'well', 'dubbed', 'elevator', 'music.Obviously', 'music', 'issue', 'still', 'head', 'season', 'not', 'original', 'songs', 'are', 'missing', 'So', 'bothers', 'seasons', '3-5', 'then', 'will', 'bother', 'one', 'as', 'well', 'As', 'far', 'DVD', 'extras', 'go', 'are', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'disc', '40', 'minutes', 'worth', 'gag', 'reels', 'time', 'still', 'commentary', 'tracks', 'scenes', 'material.All', 'would', 'characterize', 'season', 'good', 'not', 'great', 'Certainly', 'not', 'as', 'good', 'first', 'few', 'seasons', 'moments', 'quality', 'was', 'essentially', 'lost', 'trying', 'find', 'footing', 'again', 'Morrow', 'departure', 'clear', 'show', 'was', 'just', 'never', 'going', 'work', 'Unfortunately', 'show', 'did', 'not', 'have', 'kind', 'ending', 'really', 'should', 'have', 'said', 'did', 'really', 'Rob', 'Morrow', 'final', 'episode', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'better', 'having', 'interact', 'more', 'town', 'characters', 'even', 'just', 'dream', 'sequences', 'thought', 'way', 'returned', 'NY', 'was', 'very', 'fitting', 'show']",Northern Exposure: The Complete Sixth Season

Mular,"[34, 38]","When Rob Morrow announced, at the end of the 5th season, that he would not be renewing his contract to do the show, it sent the producers on a hunt for a replacement.  Since the show had started as a Summer Replacement show, Rob still had six months left in his five year contract to fulfill.  This meant that he had to appear in some of the sixth season episodes, and Rob seems to be just walking through these episodes waiting for his contract to expire.While Dr. Joel Fleischer was the basis character for the series, the town itself quickly became the star.  So the death of the series at Rob's announcement was not a given situation, replacements worked fine for M*A*S*H which had the similar ensamble style (but it was not Hawkeye they were losing).  The producers introduced a new town doctor, but this time he was not neurotic and would not be persuing Maggie (he was happily married).  That was the trouble.  In a town full of neurotic characters, replacing neurotic #1 with a bland character having less personality that the town's totum pole just reminded fans that the series was ending after all.One would think that with six months notice a better replacement could have been found.Fans could also have troubles with the character transformation of DR. Joel Fleischman.  He starts off this season like other seasons, but he quickly becomes a different character than the one we grew to enjoy.  Watching the last 10 episodes of this season could be like watching a slow death, almost like watching ""After M*A*S*H"".  The surreal series finale is perfect for this surreal series, and should have happened a few episodes earlier than it did.  The nice part about watching this on DVD is that you can skip over those Morrow-less episodes.I think that the town of Cicily Alaska could have survived the loss of DR. Joel Fleischman had the right replacement character been found.  The first 5 episodes are classic Cicily.  When Shelly meets the Devil the outcome is in the true spirit of the series.Others have listed the episodes, so I will not repeat this information.",4,Worst season of one of the best shows still has its moments.,1173139200,"03 6, 2007",2007,2076,"['When', 'Rob', 'Morrow', 'announced', 'end', '5th', 'season', 'would', 'not', 'be', 'renewing', 'contract', 'do', 'show', 'sent', 'producers', 'hunt', 'replacement', 'show', 'had', 'started', 'Summer', 'Replacement', 'show', 'Rob', 'still', 'had', 'six', 'months', 'left', 'five', 'year', 'contract', 'fulfill', 'meant', 'had', 'appear', 'sixth', 'season', 'episodes', 'Rob', 'be', 'just', 'walking', 'episodes', 'waiting', 'contract', 'expire.While', 'Dr.', 'Joel', 'Fleischer', 'was', 'basis', 'character', 'series', 'town', 'quickly', 'became', 'star', 'death', 'series', 'Rob', 'announcement', 'was', 'not', 'given', 'situation', 'replacements', 'worked', 'fine', 'M*A*S*H', 'had', 'similar', 'ensamble', 'style', 'was', 'not', 'Hawkeye', 'were', 'losing', 'producers', 'introduced', 'new', 'town', 'doctor', 'time', 'was', 'not', 'neurotic', 'would', 'not', 'be', 'persuing', 'Maggie', 'was', 'happily', 'married', 'was', 'trouble', 'town', 'full', 'neurotic', 'characters', 'replacing', 'neurotic', '1', 'bland', 'character', 'having', 'less', 'personality', 'town', 'totum', 'pole', 'just', 'reminded', 'fans', 'series', 'was', 'ending', 'all.One', 'would', 'think', 'six', 'months', 'notice', 'better', 'replacement', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'found.Fans', 'could', 'also', 'have', 'troubles', 'character', 'transformation', 'DR.', 'Joel', 'Fleischman', 'season', 'other', 'seasons', 'quickly', 'different', 'character', 'one', 'grew', 'enjoy', 'Watching', 'last', '10', 'episodes', 'season', 'could', 'be', 'watching', 'slow', 'death', 'almost', 'watching', 'M*A*S*H', 'surreal', 'series', 'finale', 'perfect', 'surreal', 'series', 'should', 'have', 'happened', 'few', 'episodes', 'earlier', 'did', 'nice', 'part', 'watching', 'DVD', 'can', 'skip', 'Morrow-less', 'episodes.I', 'think', 'town', 'Cicily', 'Alaska', 'could', 'have', 'survived', 'loss', 'DR.', 'Joel', 'Fleischman', 'had', 'right', 'replacement', 'character', 'been', 'found', 'first', '5', 'episodes', 'are', 'classic', 'Cicily', 'When', 'Shelly', 'Devil', 'outcome', 'true', 'spirit', 'series.Others', 'have', 'listed', 'episodes', 'will', 'not', 'repeat', 'information']",Northern Exposure: The Complete Sixth Season

1040492,A39IY0JU5JI69G,B000LSAJ5M,"Promise ""promise""","[5, 7]","I watched the first three seasons of Northern Exposure when they appeared on TV and loved them.  Recently I've been watching seasons 5 and 6 on DVD and am so glad that they are available.  Sometimes shows aren't as good later as they were in memory so I wasn't sure how I'd like them now.  I was so happy that I enjoyed them just as much, maybe even more than when they first aired.  Maybe it's because the cast members had grown so deeply into their characters that their performances were extraordinarily natural and had a huge impact.It was interesting to see how some of the characters matured, too.  Maggie, for some reason used to annoy me in the early days, maybe because she and Joel were always fighting and that got old.  Maybe because she made friends with the part of herself that was just like her mother. (The series is very psychologically hip.) Maybe it was just that she let her hair grow and was much softer and prettier! I was happy that Joel got out of town and left her free, finally, to find a guy who was worthy of her....the magnificent metaphysical Chris, who had to go through his own maturation process to deserve the lovely lady.I thought that the writers did a heroic job of dealing with the departure of Rob Morrow.  The culture clash of Fleischman with the Cecilians was the essence of the  beginning of the show, but after a while the other characters developed and became so interesting that we didn't need to have Joel and his neuroses in our faces every week.  The way his character developed in the final season and then faded away was masterful and quite moving.And that's how life is---people come and go and life goes on.  The new doc and his wife moved in and again I think the writers made a good choioe in the characters of Phil and Michelle Capra.  They were from LA and had the same adjustments to make as Joel but in their own way which seemed softer and friendlier than poor old Joel. I think that, in time they would have fit in to the town and to the show very well.  Too bad we'll never see that.The season keeps the magic and heart warming moments and the humor.  I loved the show that featured Ed trying to mother a bear cub...I found the way he tutored the cub in salmon fishing, all dressed up in fur, to be very dear.  Ed seemed to mature a lot, physically at least, and in some shots he was startlingly handsome.  It was nice to see a bit of the incomparable Adam although I would have liked to see more of Eve.  It was lovely of the writers to give us a happy ending to the tortured violinist!  The character of Maurice seemed to mature a lot, too.  His one dimensional crassness opened up beautifully at times, particularly in his relationships with Ed and again with the violinist.This series has got to be among the very best in American TV history--up there with Cheers, Taxi, Mary Tyler Moore and Knotts Landing--maybe at the top of the list.",5,Still magical after all these years,1238630400,"04 2, 2009",2009,2903,"['watched', 'first', 'three', 'seasons', 'Northern', 'Exposure', 'when', 'appeared', 'TV', 'loved', 'Recently', ""'ve"", 'been', 'watching', 'seasons', '5', '6', 'DVD', 'am', 'so', 'glad', 'are', 'available', 'Sometimes', 'shows', 'are', ""n't"", 'as', 'good', 'later', 'were', 'memory', 'was', ""n't"", 'sure', 'how', ""'d"", 'like', 'now', 'was', 'so', 'happy', 'enjoyed', 'just', 'as', 'much', 'maybe', 'even', 'more', 'when', 'first', 'aired', 'Maybe', 'cast', 'members', 'had', 'grown', 'so', 'deeply', 'characters', 'performances', 'were', 'extraordinarily', 'natural', 'had', 'huge', 'impact.It', 'was', 'interesting', 'see', 'how', 'characters', 'matured', 'too', 'Maggie', 'reason', 'used', 'annoy', 'early', 'days', 'maybe', 'Joel', 'were', 'always', 'fighting', 'got', 'old', 'Maybe', 'made', 'friends', 'part', 'herself', 'was', 'just', 'mother', 'series', 'very', 'psychologically', 'hip', 'Maybe', 'was', 'just', 'let', 'hair', 'grow', 'was', 'much', 'softer', 'prettier', 'was', 'happy', 'Joel', 'got', 'town', 'left', 'free', 'finally', 'find', 'guy', 'who', 'was', 'worthy', '.the', 'magnificent', 'metaphysical', 'Chris', 'who', 'had', 'go', 'own', 'maturation', 'process', 'deserve', 'lovely', 'lady.I', 'thought', 'writers', 'did', 'heroic', 'job', 'dealing', 'departure', 'Rob', 'Morrow', 'culture', 'clash', 'Fleischman', 'Cecilians', 'was', 'essence', 'beginning', 'show', 'other', 'characters', 'developed', 'became', 'so', 'interesting', 'did', ""n't"", 'need', 'have', 'Joel', 'neuroses', 'week', 'way', 'character', 'developed', 'final', 'season', 'then', 'faded', 'away', 'was', 'masterful', 'quite', 'moving.And', 'how', 'life', '-people', 'come', 'go', 'life', 'new', 'doc', 'wife', 'moved', 'again', 'think', 'writers', 'made', 'good', 'choioe', 'characters', 'Phil', 'Michelle', 'Capra', 'were', 'LA', 'had', 'same', 'adjustments', 'make', 'Joel', 'own', 'way', 'seemed', 'softer', 'friendlier', 'poor', 'old', 'Joel', 'think', 'time', 'would', 'have', 'fit', 'town', 'show', 'very', 'well', 'Too', 'bad', ""'ll"", 'never', 'see', 'that.The', 'season', 'magic', 'heart', 'warming', 'moments', 'humor', 'loved', 'show', 'featured', 'Ed', 'trying', 'mother', 'bear', 'cub', 'found', 'way', 'tutored', 'cub', 'salmon', 'fishing', 'dressed', 'up', 'fur', 'be', 'very', 'dear', 'Ed', 'seemed', 'mature', 'lot', 'physically', 'least', 'shots', 'was', 'startlingly', 'handsome', 'was', 'nice', 'see', 'bit', 'incomparable', 'Adam', 'would', 'have', 'liked', 'see', 'more', 'Eve', 'was', 'lovely', 'writers', 'give', 'happy', 'ending', 'tortured', 'violinist', 'character', 'Maurice', 'seemed', 'mature', 'lot', 'too', 'one', 'dimensional', 'crassness', 'opened', 'up', 'beautifully', 'times', 'particularly', 'relationships', 'Ed', 'again', 'violinist.This', 'series', 'got', 'be', 'very', 'best', 'American', 'TV', 'history', 'there', 'Cheers', 'Taxi', 'Mary', 'Tyler', 'Moore', 'Knotts', 'Landing', 'maybe', 'top', 'list']",Northern Exposure: The Complete Sixth Season
1040493,A1D702T7C8VDBL,B000LSAJ5M,"R. Howell ""boriskhan""","[10, 11]","Season six of Northern Exposure saw the departure of Rob Morrow from the role of Dr Joel Fleischman, purportedly over contract disputes. In Joel's final episode, ""The Quest"" there seems to be some light hearted jabbing fun of this making reference to 'Quiz Show'. So could the show have lasted without it's primary character? So many shows are proof that removal of the central character is the downfall of the show, we can only assume that's the reason here. Personally I think they could have made it through another season but it could also have hurt themselves dreadfully. In hindsight, it's probably good that NE ended with this season in a bittersweet moment.This season was full of ups and downs, there were some great quirky episodes such as 'Ursa Minor' where Ed becomes surrogate mother to a bear cub. We also see Ed become a private detective, house sitter, theater employee, as well as his jobs at Maurice's, Ruth Anne's, scriptwriting,  and a shaman-in-training. Maggie partakes of becoming mayor and buying the locale movie theater (as well as bush piloting and real estate). Joel changes his life view after living with Maggie and he runs of to an even more backwoods village upriver. Mid season enters the replacement characters of Phil & Michelle Capra. Michelle becomes a more central character than the new doctor does, and she quickly became annoying in the show. About this time, we are also treated to the rather forced courtship of Maggie and Chris-in-the-Morning. The last episode left something to be desired for a series finale but the final song ""Our Town"" was a perfect song end for the series. One problem I always had with the finale was Maggie wasn't in it until the last 7-8 minutes, if that. You don't get the explanation until you see the deleted scenes.As for the dvd set itself, I think better planning could have gone into this set and there should have been six discs instead of five. Two or three of the discs have 5 episodes each on them while the others only have four. The best thing is the deleted scenes are now accessible along with each episode they pertained to. More great still shots of the cast decorated the covers, and come in an orange box this time around. Menus are easy to follow and even some of the original music managed to stay in place. Sadly, still no 'gag reels' unless they are hidden features somewhere, but I can't find any.Overall, if you loved the series, you will still love it now.",4,With or without Joel,1176681600,"04 16, 2007",2007,2451,"['Season', 'six', 'Northern', 'Exposure', 'saw', 'departure', 'Rob', 'Morrow', 'role', 'Dr', 'Joel', 'Fleischman', 'purportedly', 'contract', 'disputes', 'Joel', 'final', 'episode', 'Quest', 'there', 'be', 'light', 'hearted', 'jabbing', 'fun', 'making', 'reference', ""'Quiz"", 'Show', 'So', 'could', 'show', 'have', 'lasted', 'primary', 'character', 'So', 'many', 'shows', 'are', 'proof', 'removal', 'central', 'character', 'downfall', 'show', 'can', 'only', 'assume', 'reason', 'here', 'Personally', 'think', 'could', 'have', 'made', 'season', 'could', 'also', 'have', 'hurt', 'dreadfully', 'hindsight', 'probably', 'good', 'NE', 'ended', 'season', 'bittersweet', 'moment.This', 'season', 'was', 'full', 'ups', 'downs', 'were', 'great', 'quirky', 'episodes', 'such', ""'Ursa"", 'Minor', 'where', 'Ed', 'surrogate', 'mother', 'bear', 'cub', 'also', 'see', 'Ed', 'become', 'private', 'detective', 'house', 'sitter', 'theater', 'employee', 'as', 'well', 'jobs', 'Maurice', 'Ruth', 'Anne', 'scriptwriting', 'shaman-in-training', 'Maggie', 'partakes', 'becoming', 'mayor', 'buying', 'locale', 'movie', 'theater', 'as', 'well', 'bush', 'piloting', 'real', 'estate', 'Joel', 'life', 'view', 'living', 'Maggie', 'even', 'more', 'backwoods', 'village', 'upriver', 'Mid', 'season', 'replacement', 'characters', 'Phil', 'Michelle', 'Capra', 'Michelle', 'more', 'central', 'character', 'new', 'doctor', 'quickly', 'became', 'annoying', 'show', 'time', 'are', 'also', 'treated', 'rather', 'forced', 'courtship', 'Maggie', 'Chris-in-the-Morning', 'last', 'episode', 'left', 'something', 'be', 'desired', 'series', 'finale', 'final', 'song', 'Town', 'was', 'perfect', 'song', 'end', 'series', 'One', 'problem', 'always', 'had', 'finale', 'was', 'Maggie', 'was', ""n't"", 'last', '7-8', 'minutes', 'do', ""n't"", 'get', 'explanation', 'see', 'deleted', 'scenes.As', 'dvd', 'set', 'think', 'better', 'planning', 'could', 'have', 'gone', 'set', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'six', 'discs', 'instead', 'five', 'Two', 'three', 'discs', 'have', '5', 'episodes', 'others', 'only', 'have', 'four', 'best', 'thing', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'are', 'now', 'accessible', 'episode', 'pertained', 'More', 'great', 'still', 'shots', 'cast', 'decorated', 'covers', 'come', 'orange', 'box', 'time', 'around', 'Menus', 'are', 'easy', 'follow', 'even', 'original', 'music', 'managed', 'stay', 'place', 'Sadly', 'still', ""'gag"", 'reels', 'are', 'hidden', 'features', 'somewhere', 'ca', ""n't"", 'find', 'any.Overall', 'loved', 'series', 'will', 'still', 'love', 'now']",Northern Exposure: The Complete Sixth Season

Overton,"[1, 1]","A fitting conclusion to a creative televison premise, though it's interesting that the initial comedy impulse appears to have given way to more melodrama & less comedy by the last season. Apparently, there were contract tensions with Rob Morrow--who had moved on to the acclaimed film, QUIZ SHOW--& his restlessness (& ego) shows a bit, as he heads even further North & improbably goes native. The change in people behind the scenes--inevitable after 6 years--begins to be apparent. There's a mild loss of enthusiasm in the scripts & direction. I was surprised, nonetheless, that it held up as well as it did in its finale. Usually shows like this peak around season 3 or 4, then clearly decline in originality & energy--they settle into predictable narrative formulas & we tire of the quirks & defining characteristics of the ensemble cast. Speaking of &#34;peaks,&#34; this has always been a kinder, gentler Twin Peaks. The feedback fondness for the entire 6 seasons is well deserved, though I'm puzzled by this obsession that all of the original broadcast music is not preserved in the dvd versions (because of the escalating cost of obtaining music rights). The show's strength is in its writing, especially, & in its consistently professional cast, not in its music. (I think it's a generational thing.) The music substituted is hardly the muzak claimed. It's always appropriate, frequently extraordinary--though I don't have total recall & am not a pop music fan so can't spot the (apparently) few places where there's variation.

Each and every episode of Northern Exposure has a plot and enough great writing and acting to be full length movies in their own right. Whoever was the casting directeor did an outstanding job with getting this cast together in the beginning because they all seem to fit their parts so well. Also, how many shows that are an hour long each week can last 6 seasons without the quality of the episodes going down at all. Sure, many people didn't like the fact that Joel left in this, the 6th and last season, but all of the Joel-less episodes were still great. And if you want to get technical, Joel did play in almost half of this season's episodes anyway. Each and every episode of this show was like I went on an adventure with the people of Cicely, Alaska, and I never wanted to come back. So many wonderful memries like Ed buying Ruth-Anne and burial plot and dancing on it with her, Chirs' legal trouble with the state of West Virginia, Holling's mid-life crisis at 63 years old, Joel discovering a wolly mammoth that Walt ends up cooking on his grill, and I could go on and on. Season 6 has its share of touching moments as well, most noteable is the very last episode called Tranquility Base. Did anyone feel bad for Ed when at the end of this episode everyone had someone to be with, but Ed went back home alone. But he had his movies and seemed as happy as anyone else.Speaking of this ""Tranquility Base"", I would like to plead to whoever is releasing this set of DVD's to PLEASE leave the song ""Our Town"" in this last episode. I know the music has been reowrked a lot in these DVD's, but this song is crutial to this last epsidoe and it should be left in!I was saddened to hear Peg Phillips (Ruth Ann) died a few years back.

We all loved the goofy charm of Northern Exposure or wouldn't have gotten to the sixth season. But the price of fairy dust was many of the characters were stuck in eternal childhood. The show became less a cartoonish Hallmark card on togetherness (which I loved, pure fantasy) and more of a character study.Watching it now, especially after 'The Sopranos' had its run, you can see the effect of David Chase's rising influence on the show. Watch the sixth season again and compare to the Sopranos, you can see everything from the intense closeness of ties, to the fantasy (delusional?) scenes, the conflicts played out in often uncomfortable back and forth, to the unflinching look at the darkness of even the most fairy-dust infused characters.The sweetness that coated their flaws in earlier seasons has diminished and we get to see them more realistically, they balance out. Maurice and even Shelly show real ugliness. We've always seen Maurice abuse and swagger his power in benevolent terms that leave everyone rolling their eyes or smirking, but here we get to see the real despot always hinted at and the insecurity that drives it -- when he ends up with Barbara its because he can finally hand over the reigns to someone he recognizes as someone very much like himself but with more integrity. Maggie and Joel develop a new inner stability and acceptance, both growing softer and more lovable. Ed, Holling and Shelly emerge from living like the approval-seeking, abandoned children they were, and insist on their place, showing real fight when challenged standing up to the town's ultimate authority figure: Maurice. Chris's endless analysis of life around him finally gets turned inward and he begins to lose his complacency and begins to care for himself and others in new profound ways. Ruth Ann loses her stoic matriarchal superiority and allows herself to look the fool for Walt. But what didn't change was the way the village accepted each other.As for the new doctor and his wife, they were just as sweet and loving as the original Cecilians. They were also quirky but unlike the other citizens of the show they had real self-awareness and eagerly sought out opportunities to grow in time to do it with everyone else -- a fairy tale in itself really. Unlike Joel, they respected the people in the village and learned from them. It might just be you relate to them too much to appreciate how quirky they really were. :)So I love this season. I was getting impatient with the fairy tale because the characters were so potentially interesting but were frozen in fairy dust. It was wonderful to finally see them grow and usually we grow through conflict. David Chase kept his vision and was able to start out from the beginning to paint another village of sharp archetypical and fanciful characters full of loyalty and delusion, battling the elements, who had each other for better and worse to create another one of the best shows on TV. Interestingly Chase lost NE because of character growth and in Sopranos the characters almost uniformly refused to change over the years. In many ways you can see where Northern Exposure influenced him significantly.",5,The fairy dust blew away and the characters grew,1369094400,"05 21, 2013",2013,3401,"['feel', 'do', 'was', 'always', 'fairy', 'dust', 'sprinkled', 'streets', 'Cicely', ""'ll"", 'find', 'bit', 'dust', 'blown', 'away', 'really', 'transition', 'was', 'very', 'welcome', 'change', 'loved', 'goofy', 'charm', 'Northern', 'Exposure', 'would', ""n't"", 'have', 'gotten', 'sixth', 'season', 'price', 'fairy', 'dust', 'was', 'many', 'characters', 'were', 'stuck', 'eternal', 'childhood', 'show', 'became', 'less', 'cartoonish', 'Hallmark', 'card', 'togetherness', 'loved', 'pure', 'fantasy', 'more', 'character', 'study.Watching', 'now', 'especially', ""'The"", 'Sopranos', 'had', 'run', 'can', 'see', 'effect', 'David', 'Chase', 'rising', 'influence', 'show', 'Watch', 'sixth', 'season', 'again', 'compare', 'Sopranos', 'can', 'see', 'everything', 'intense', 'closeness', 'ties', 'fantasy', 'delusional', 'scenes', 'conflicts', 'played', 'out', 'often', 'uncomfortable', 'back', 'forth', 'unflinching', 'look', 'darkness', 'even', 'most', 'fairy-dust', 'infused', 'characters.The', 'sweetness', 'coated', 'flaws', 'earlier', 'seasons', 'diminished', 'get', 'see', 'more', 'realistically', 'balance', 'out', 'Maurice', 'even', 'Shelly', 'show', 'real', 'ugliness', ""'ve"", 'always', 'seen', 'Maurice', 'abuse', 'swagger', 'power', 'benevolent', 'terms', 'leave', 'everyone', 'rolling', 'eyes', 'smirking', 'here', 'get', 'see', 'real', 'despot', 'always', 'hinted', 'insecurity', 'when', 'up', 'Barbara', 'can', 'finally', 'hand', 'reigns', 'someone', 'someone', 'very', 'much', 'more', 'integrity', 'Maggie', 'Joel', 'develop', 'new', 'inner', 'stability', 'acceptance', 'growing', 'softer', 'more', 'lovable', 'Ed', 'Holling', 'Shelly', 'emerge', 'living', 'approval-seeking', 'abandoned', 'children', 'were', 'insist', 'place', 'showing', 'real', 'fight', 'when', 'challenged', 'standing', 'up', 'town', 'ultimate', 'authority', 'figure', 'Maurice', 'Chris', 'endless', 'analysis', 'life', 'finally', 'turned', 'inward', 'lose', 'complacency', 'care', 'others', 'new', 'profound', 'ways', 'Ruth', 'Ann', 'stoic', 'matriarchal', 'superiority', 'look', 'fool', 'Walt', 'what', 'did', ""n't"", 'change', 'was', 'way', 'village', 'accepted', 'other.As', 'new', 'doctor', 'wife', 'were', 'just', 'sweet', 'loving', 'original', 'Cecilians', 'were', 'also', 'quirky', 'other', 'citizens', 'show', 'had', 'real', 'self-awareness', 'eagerly', 'sought', 'out', 'opportunities', 'grow', 'time', 'do', 'everyone', 'else', 'fairy', 'tale', 'really', 'Joel', 'respected', 'people', 'village', 'learned', 'might', 'just', 'be', 'relate', 'too', 'much', 'appreciate', 'how', 'quirky', 'really', 'were', 'love', 'season', 'was', 'getting', 'impatient', 'fairy', 'tale', 'characters', 'were', 'so', 'potentially', 'interesting', 'were', 'frozen', 'fairy', 'dust', 'was', 'wonderful', 'finally', 'see', 'grow', 'usually', 'grow', 'conflict', 'David', 'Chase', 'kept', 'vision', 'was', 'able', 'start', 'out', 'beginning', 'paint', 'village', 'sharp', 'archetypical', 'fanciful', 'characters', 'full', 'loyalty', 'delusion', 'battling', 'elements', 'who', 'had', 'other', 'better', 'worse', 'create', 'one', 'best', 'shows', 'TV', 'Interestingly', 'Chase', 'lost', 'NE', 'character', 'growth', 'Sopranos', 'characters', 'almost', 'uniformly', 'refused', 'change', 'years', 'many', 'ways', 'can', 'see', 'where', 'Northern', 'Exposure', 'influenced', 'significantly']",Northern Exposure: The Complete Sixth Season
