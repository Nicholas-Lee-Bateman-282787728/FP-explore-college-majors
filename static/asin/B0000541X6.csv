As he corrects certain things, he is able to move forward in the present.  The story of this episode has been seen before, but it is enjoyable all the same.The second episode here is ""Thank God It's Friday, Again"".  This episode takes place on a planet where every day is a work day, every night is a huge party with the promise that tomorrow is a rest day.  However, when tomorrow becomes today, the cycle is repeated.  The people are slaves to a plant which they cultivate.  The plant works like a narcotic on most of the people.  Some are able to resist and others with the help of a worm implanted in them can resist as well.  Crichton is given such a worm and soon learns the secret of the plant and this planet.  The plant is used by the Peacekeepers as it fuels their energy weapons and the planet is a giant storage facility for them.If you've never seen Farscape, this is a well-written show and worth watching.",5,Two Good Episodes,1029283200,"08 14, 2002",2002,1099,"['Back', 'Back', 'Back', 'Future', 'episode', 'where', 'Crichton', 'able', 'experience', 'future', 'then', 'return', 'back', 'present', 'when', 'things', 'go', 'wrong', 'killed', 'certain', 'things', 'able', 'move', 'forward', 'present', 'story', 'episode', 'been', 'seen', 'enjoyable', 'same.The', 'second', 'episode', 'here', 'Thank', 'God', 'Friday', 'Again', 'episode', 'place', 'planet', 'where', 'day', 'work', 'day', 'night', 'huge', 'party', 'promise', 'tomorrow', 'rest', 'day', 'However', 'when', 'tomorrow', 'today', 'cycle', 'repeated', 'people', 'are', 'plant', 'cultivate', 'plant', 'narcotic', 'most', 'people', 'are', 'able', 'resist', 'others', 'help', 'worm', 'implanted', 'can', 'resist', 'as', 'well', 'Crichton', 'given', 'worm', 'soon', 'secret', 'plant', 'planet', 'plant', 'used', 'Peacekeepers', 'energy', 'weapons', 'planet', 'giant', 'storage', 'facility', 'them.If', ""'ve"", 'never', 'seen', 'Farscape', 'well-written', 'show', 'worth', 'watching']","Farscape Season 1, Vol. 1 - Premiere/I, E.T."

However, the quality of the DVDs continues to be very high, and this more than makes up for the slowness of the release schedule.""Back and Back and Back to the Future"" offers an episode in which the arrival of scientist Verell and his assistant, Matala, on Moya brings with it an intriguing mystery as Crichton suffers from 'time flashes' that lead to worse and worse results every time he changes the future.  The story has an unusual, FARSCAPE twist to time travel, and the strength of the episode lies in the developing relationships between the various characters.  The extra footage found in this episode sheds some light on a few things, and goes to show what North American television commercials deem as footage not worthy of airing, yet it has some importance to the episode.  A commentary version of the episode by Ben Browder and director Rowan Woods makes for intereresting viewing, and sheds a lot of light on how episodic television is made.The second episode, ""Thank God It's Friday, Again"", is one in which our heroes travel down to the planet Sykar to find D'Argo, who left the ship in a Luxan hyper rage some three days prior.  What they find is a planet strangely at peace, D'Argo not wanting to return to Moya but happy to be harvesting tannot root from the ground, and a culture that seems to be living in a drug-induced blissfulness.  Add to that Rygel's body fluids becoming explosive, and the story takes some interesting twists, with the neat revelation towards the end.  This is a fine episode, that shows a softer side to at least three of the characters (D'Argo, Zhaan, and Aeryn), and has some interesting aspects of morality to it.  The extra footage in this one has some good scenes but there's nothing here that makes this episode worth the wait for the DVD.  On the other hand, the commentary version with Rockne S. O'Bannon and Anthony Simcoe is a delight to watch, and sheds a good deal of light into the thinking that went into the story and into some of the aspects of how Anth chose to play D'Argo in this episode and some of the other acting aspects of the story.

Bernabo,"[0, 0]","I am a &quot;Farscape&quot; neophyte working their way through Season 1 and it seems clear to me that Volume 3 is where this science fiction series starts clicking as the characters start to emerge with some complexity and the stories fit this point in the saga.  The common denominator here is that human John Crichton (Ben Browder) gets to save the day to the relief, if not the surprise, of his new crewmates.&quot;Back and Back and Back to the Future&quot; is, as the title suggests, a time travel tale in which Crichton becomes unstuck in time.  The fun here is decoding when Crichton has flashed forward and when he is back in the present, and, of course, his attempts to convince the others that he is telling the truth and not gone insane.  This is the best episode of the series so far, not only because there it is well thought out but also because there are some key moments regarding character interaction and revelation.&quot;Thank God It's Friday..Again&quot; is too reminiscent of the &quot;Star Trek&quot; episode where Spock gets pollinated and is happy for a while to really be a standout episode.  However, there is a standout performance by a guest star as the leader of the shiny happy people.  Once again, the best parts of the episode have to do with the character interaction, particularly between Aeryn (Claudia Black) and Rygel (Jonathan Hardy) as well as Zhaan (Virginia Hey) and D'Argo (Anthony Simcoe).One of the things that is most commendable about &quot;Farscape&quot; is that these DVDs are extremely fan friendly.  All of the episodes (so far) offer commentary tracks by a rotating pair of cast and crewmembers.  This time around it is actor Browder and director Rowan Woods on &quot;Back and Back and Back to the Future&quot; and actor Simcoe and series creator Rockne S. O'Bannon on &quot;Thank God It's Friday...Again.&quot;  Having the tag team commentary works well and the talk is usually about the series and the characters overall as well as the individual characters.There is also a video profile of a &quot;Farscape&quot; character on each disc and this time around it is the turn of Virginia Hey and Pa'u Zotoh Zhaan, the most fascinating alien of the current media generation.

The first one is basically how John got on Moya and has some nice battle scenes as well as making contact on Blade Runner esque planet. It introduces most of the main characters in the first season such as Aeryn, D'Argo, Rygel, Zhann and the ever popular Pilot. The second episode is I, ET. The reason for this name is that John meets another speices of aliens who think he's an alien (odd), but the best part of this episode is how Rygel and Zhann try to disarm a tracking device on Moya. The main reason I love Farscape is for Pilot. Pilot is my favorite character of the whole show! DVD extras includes a documentary on Farscape with all the cast, crew and puppeteers. Even more, there is another video featuring Ben Browder talking about his character in the show. The DVD also gives image gallery of Ben Browder and conceptual art of the ship and Pilot. Audio preference is very good giving you a choice of English 2.0, 5.1 and commentary which changes every episode. In other words, the first episode has commentary with Ben Browder and Brian Henson while episode 2 will feature commentary by Claudia Black and Anthony Simcoe. The commentary prooves to be very amusing at times giving reference to some of the stage sets and also gives the american audiance a better understanding of the show. The menus are fair. The main screen features a slighty tilted screen, the extras menu has a slower version of the opening in the back, audio select has a nice full screen of the part where Moya crashes into a bog which is really just a 6 second sequence thats played over and over and the scene selection is overall well done. One thing people might dislike is the fact that every menu has the same music (the opening music). One last thing worth mentioning is the English subtitles which are pretty small but you should be able to read them. Overall, a great DVD that is easily a must-see for anyone.",5,The best scifi show ever,984873600,"03 18, 2001",2001,2102,"['did', ""n't"", 'really', 'get', 'Farscape', 'saw', 'trailer', 'DVD', 'ADV', 'quickly', 'got', 'DVD', 'was', 'worth', 'first', 'many', 'DVD', 'first', 'two', '50', 'minute', 'episodes', 'first', 'one', 'basically', 'how', 'John', 'got', 'Moya', 'nice', 'battle', 'scenes', 'as', 'well', 'making', 'contact', 'Blade', 'Runner', 'esque', 'planet', 'most', 'main', 'characters', 'first', 'season', 'such', 'Aeryn', ""D'Argo"", 'Rygel', 'Zhann', 'ever', 'popular', 'Pilot', 'second', 'episode', 'ET', 'reason', 'name', 'John', 'speices', 'aliens', 'who', 'think', 'alien', 'odd', 'best', 'part', 'episode', 'how', 'Rygel', 'Zhann', 'try', 'disarm', 'tracking', 'device', 'Moya', 'main', 'reason', 'love', 'Farscape', 'Pilot', 'Pilot', 'favorite', 'character', 'whole', 'show', 'DVD', 'extras', 'documentary', 'Farscape', 'cast', 'crew', 'puppeteers', 'Even', 'more', 'video', 'featuring', 'Ben', 'Browder', 'talking', 'character', 'show', 'DVD', 'also', 'image', 'gallery', 'Ben', 'Browder', 'conceptual', 'art', 'ship', 'Pilot', 'Audio', 'preference', 'very', 'good', 'giving', 'choice', 'English', '2.0', '5.1', 'commentary', 'episode', 'other', 'words', 'first', 'episode', 'commentary', 'Ben', 'Browder', 'Brian', 'Henson', 'episode', '2', 'will', 'feature', 'commentary', 'Claudia', 'Black', 'Anthony', 'Simcoe', 'commentary', 'prooves', 'be', 'very', 'amusing', 'times', 'giving', 'reference', 'stage', 'sets', 'also', 'american', 'audiance', 'better', 'understanding', 'show', 'menus', 'are', 'fair', 'main', 'screen', 'slighty', 'tilted', 'screen', 'extras', 'menu', 'slower', 'version', 'opening', 'back', 'audio', 'select', 'nice', 'full', 'screen', 'part', 'where', 'Moya', 'bog', 'really', 'just', '6', 'second', 'sequence', 'thats', 'played', 'scene', 'selection', 'overall', 'well', 'done', 'One', 'thing', 'people', 'might', 'dislike', 'fact', 'menu', 'same', 'music', 'opening', 'music', 'One', 'last', 'thing', 'worth', 'mentioning', 'English', 'subtitles', 'are', 'pretty', 'small', 'should', 'be', 'able', 'read', 'Overall', 'great', 'DVD', 'easily', 'must-see', 'anyone']","Farscape Season 1, Vol. 1 - Premiere/I, E.T."

That seems like a lot of DVDs or, should I say, few episodes per the DVD.

He finds himself in the middle of a space battle between what turns out to be a prison ship and the galactic police who are called the peacekeepers. John's tiny craft is pulled into the prison ship and he himself becomes a prison of the prisoners. John is forced to use his wits in order to survive in a completely alien universe.My Opinion:  I had heard a lot of buzz about Farscape, but nothing specific. I was reserved having been disappointed by more than a few SciFi shows in the past. I'm pleased to say that I was very happy with what I found. Even though the ""worm hole into another universe"" theme has been used many times, FarScape does a great job with it. The characters are intelligent, and well thought out. The first two episodes had good plots which is not a given with today's shows. John Crichton is a very likeable and strong main character. I'm looking forward to where Volume 2 of FarScape will take me.DVD Quality:  Standard 1.33:1 because it is a TV show. Extras include a ""Making of"" and an ""actor profile"" for Ben Browder. It would be nice to have more than two episodes per DVD.What You Should Do:  See it!

In what seems like mere moments he finds himself aboard a living vessel named Moya with a group of escaped convicts trying desperately to outrun a race called the Peacekeepers and their leader whose brother Crichton accidentally caused to perish. In order to escape these forces, the crew of Moya are forced to head into the Uncharted Territories, knowing that they will be followed but that at least the pull of the Peacekeepers isn't a strong as it is elsewhere. Yes, space isn't what it seems.In these two episodes from the first season, we find D'Argo, a creature from a warrior race with tendrils sprouting from both the top of his head and his chin, as our focal point.In the first piece, ""Back and Back and Back to the Future,"" the crew of Moya decide to rescue a couple of aliens from their ship that seems to be disintegrating. One of those on board, a female, seems to have some strange allure over both Crichton and D'Argo, putting D'Argo at odds with the human and jealous of what the other members of the crew think. Added to this is the fact that Crichton starts to have flashes of the future, and it seems that this future contains elements that don't seem to lead anywhere but demise.To me, this episode was a worthwhile one that had some hidden portions within the plot and that played with the mind of the ever-maddening human as he tries to cope with the oddities of space. Its also interesting to see how he thinks he can change things like so many others would only to see that lead to an even worse fate over and over again, making him wonder if he's simply going mad, if things can be changed if he's not, and why he had to end up with such an unwelcome gift in the first place.In the next episode, ""Thank God Its Friday - Again,"" D'Argo finds himself possessed by something called Hyper Rage, making him aggressive toward any male he sees as a challenge to him, and Crichton finds himself hiding for three days until, at last, D'Argo decides to leave Moya and head for the planet Sykar. When the crew decides to go in search of him, they find him at peace within himself and the society he's found there, happy with the lifestyle of hard work and partying that this allows. Other problems soon begin to manifest as Rygel's bodily fluids become explosive for some reason and Zhaan seems to be overcome by whatever is influencing D'Argo.This is also an episode I found rather enjoyable because a few things happen here that explain the ways that some societies fuel other ones, and the way that oppression can be elation depending on how its presented. It also places Crichton in some precarious situations when it comes to staying alive, and shows the duality of some of the crew and the bonds that begin to form between some of them; even the ex-Peacekeeper and the Pilot that once despised all their kind.For anyone that hasn't looked into Farscape yet, I would suggest going back to the Premiere DVD, watching it, and allowing yourself be hooked by the storyline and the characters being developed therein. The dialogue is of the greatest of qualities and only gets better as the show progresses, the individuals that are chasing and the people fleeing are all interesting and the events of today create the rippling effects of tomorrow, plus there is a point to everything taking place. The creative team that developed it should be commended and recommended highly, at least in this viewer's book.",5,D'Argo's Time To Shine,1048118400,"03 20, 2003",2003,3659,"['finding', '[', 'pulled', 'through', ']', 'wormhole', 'thrust', 'depths', 'space', 'human', 'had', 'envisioned', 'Astronaut', 'John', 'Crichton', 'confronted', 'Worlds', 'comprehension', 'what', 'mere', 'moments', 'living', 'vessel', 'named', 'Moya', 'group', 'escaped', 'convicts', 'trying', 'desperately', 'outrun', 'race', 'called', 'Peacekeepers', 'leader', 'brother', 'Crichton', 'accidentally', 'caused', 'perish', 'order', 'escape', 'forces', 'crew', 'Moya', 'are', 'forced', 'head', 'Uncharted', 'Territories', 'knowing', 'will', 'be', 'followed', 'least', 'pull', 'Peacekeepers', ""n't"", 'strong', 'elsewhere', 'Yes', 'space', ""n't"", 'what', 'two', 'episodes', 'first', 'season', 'find', ""D'Argo"", 'creature', 'warrior', 'race', 'tendrils', 'sprouting', 'top', 'head', 'chin', 'focal', 'point.In', 'first', 'piece', 'Back', 'Back', 'Back', 'Future', 'crew', 'Moya', 'decide', 'rescue', 'couple', 'aliens', 'ship', 'be', 'disintegrating', 'One', 'board', 'female', 'have', 'strange', 'allure', 'Crichton', ""D'Argo"", 'putting', ""D'Argo"", 'odds', 'human', 'jealous', 'what', 'other', 'members', 'crew', 'think', 'Added', 'fact', 'Crichton', 'have', 'flashes', 'future', 'future', 'elements', 'do', ""n't"", 'seem', 'lead', 'anywhere', 'demise.To', 'episode', 'was', 'worthwhile', 'one', 'had', 'hidden', 'portions', 'plot', 'played', 'mind', 'ever-maddening', 'human', 'cope', 'oddities', 'space', 'also', 'interesting', 'see', 'how', 'can', 'change', 'things', 'so', 'many', 'others', 'would', 'only', 'see', 'lead', 'even', 'worse', 'fate', 'over', 'again', 'making', 'wonder', 'simply', 'going', 'mad', 'things', 'can', 'be', 'changed', 'not', 'why', 'had', 'end', 'up', 'unwelcome', 'gift', 'first', 'next', 'episode', 'Thank', 'God', 'Friday', 'Again', ""D'Argo"", 'possessed', 'something', 'called', 'Hyper', 'Rage', 'making', 'aggressive', 'male', 'challenge', 'Crichton', 'hiding', 'three', 'days', 'last', ""D'Argo"", 'leave', 'Moya', 'head', 'planet', 'Sykar', 'When', 'crew', 'go', 'search', 'find', 'peace', 'society', 'found', 'there', 'happy', 'lifestyle', 'hard', 'work', 'partying', 'Other', 'problems', 'soon', 'begin', 'manifest', 'Rygel', 'bodily', 'fluids', 'become', 'explosive', 'reason', 'Zhaan', 'be', 'overcome', 'influencing', ""D'Argo.This"", 'also', 'episode', 'found', 'rather', 'enjoyable', 'few', 'things', 'happen', 'here', 'explain', 'ways', 'societies', 'fuel', 'other', 'ones', 'way', 'oppression', 'can', 'be', 'elation', 'depending', 'how', 'presented', 'also', 'Crichton', 'precarious', 'situations', 'when', 'staying', 'alive', 'duality', 'crew', 'bonds', 'begin', 'form', 'even', 'ex-Peacekeeper', 'Pilot', 'once', 'despised', 'kind.For', 'anyone', ""n't"", 'looked', 'Farscape', 'yet', 'would', 'suggest', 'going', 'back', 'Premiere', 'DVD', 'watching', 'allowing', 'be', 'hooked', 'storyline', 'characters', 'being', 'developed', 'therein', 'dialogue', 'greatest', 'qualities', 'only', 'better', 'show', 'individuals', 'are', 'chasing', 'people', 'fleeing', 'are', 'interesting', 'events', 'today', 'create', 'rippling', 'effects', 'tomorrow', 'point', 'everything', 'taking', 'place', 'creative', 'team', 'developed', 'should', 'be', 'commended', 'recommended', 'highly', 'least', 'viewer', 'book']","Farscape Season 1, Vol. 1 - Premiere/I, E.T."
