One of them was trying too hard...so hard that it actually made us uncomfortable watching him.  Michael Jr. was the best...laugh-out-loud funny, thank goodness!  Michael Jr. is why I can give this DVD 3 stars instead of 2.  If you have the money to spend, I would buy this to encourage more clean stand-up, but at the same time, I would like to send a message that we aren't so desperate for clean stand-up that we would tolerate sub-standard comedians.",3,I wanted to give this more stars....,1374710400,"07 25, 2013",2013,605,"['really', 'really', 'wanted', 'give', 'Clean', 'STand-Up', 'Comedy', 'Tour', 'more', 'stars', 'truth', 'couple', 'stand', 'up', 'comedians', 'were', 'barely', 'funny', 'One', 'was', 'trying', 'too', 'hard', 'so', 'hard', 'actually', 'made', 'uncomfortable', 'watching', 'Michael', 'Jr.', 'was', 'best', 'laugh-out-loud', 'funny', 'thank', 'goodness', 'Michael', 'Jr.', 'why', 'can', 'give', 'DVD', '3', 'stars', 'instead', '2', 'have', 'money', 'spend', 'would', 'buy', 'encourage', 'more', 'clean', 'stand-up', 'same', 'time', 'would', 'like', 'send', 'message', 'are', ""n't"", 'so', 'desperate', 'clean', 'stand-up', 'would', 'tolerate', 'sub-standard', 'comedians']",N/A

981274,A3ICDLUQ3V2QY2,B000F1IO0W,"Kevin L. Nenstiel ""omnivore""","[5, 6]","So I'm watching these sets by four stand-up comedians who work clean, and who, I have to admit, are pretty good.  But it feels like they didn't bring their A-Game today, like maybe they're holding something back.  Then halfway through the third set, I notice a really egregious edit jump between two gags.  That's when I realize, these guys have probably been handled roughly in the editing room.I let it slide until after the film itself.  Then, thumbing through the special features, I spy a segment titled ""Deleted Jokes.""  So I click that, and I get several minutes of top drawer material.  It's all still clean and family-friendly, but it pushes the audience a little farther, it's edgier, and it challenges us to think just a little harder.  And I wonder quietly to myself: what else got cut?  What else is missing from here?Many of the other special features are really Jesus-y, including a short exhortation by a pastor who explicitly hopes this DVD will make a good evangelism tool.  So I scratch my chin and think, hmmm, is that why so many good, edgy jokes got trimmed from the film?  Is there some Comedy Commandment I missed out on?  Thou shalt not make the flock laugh too hard?This film is good, and I did laugh.  It features four comics, two of whom, Thor Ramsey and Michael Jr, are superstars of the Christian comedy circuit.  This film is punchy, and it keeps you on your toes.  Yet watching, it felt like the performers were playing it too safe.  Unlike the cutting-edgeThou Shalt Laughfilms in the last few years, this one feels like it's been declawed for audience protection",3,Over-Edited,1250985600,"08 23, 2009",2009,1596,"['So', ""'m"", 'watching', 'sets', 'four', 'stand-up', 'comedians', 'who', 'work', 'clean', 'who', 'have', 'admit', 'are', 'pretty', 'good', 'did', ""n't"", 'bring', 'A-Game', 'today', 'maybe', ""'re"", 'holding', 'something', 'back', 'Then', 'halfway', 'third', 'set', 'notice', 'really', 'egregious', 'edit', 'jump', 'two', 'gags', 'when', 'realize', 'guys', 'have', 'probably', 'been', 'handled', 'roughly', 'editing', 'room.I', 'let', 'slide', 'film', 'Then', 'thumbing', 'special', 'features', 'spy', 'segment', 'titled', 'Deleted', 'Jokes', 'click', 'get', 'several', 'minutes', 'top', 'drawer', 'material', 'still', 'clean', 'family-friendly', 'audience', 'little', 'farther', 'edgier', 'think', 'just', 'little', 'harder', 'wonder', 'quietly', 'myself', 'what', 'else', 'got', 'cut', 'What', 'else', 'missing', 'here', 'Many', 'other', 'special', 'features', 'are', 'really', 'Jesus-y', 'including', 'short', 'exhortation', 'pastor', 'who', 'explicitly', 'DVD', 'will', 'make', 'good', 'evangelism', 'tool', 'scratch', 'chin', 'think', 'hmmm', 'why', 'so', 'many', 'good', 'edgy', 'jokes', 'got', 'trimmed', 'film', 'there', 'Comedy', 'Commandment', 'missed', 'out', 'Thou', 'shalt', 'not', 'make', 'flock', 'laugh', 'too', 'hard', 'film', 'good', 'did', 'laugh', 'four', 'comics', 'two', 'whom', 'Thor', 'Ramsey', 'Michael', 'Jr', 'are', 'superstars', 'Christian', 'comedy', 'circuit', 'film', 'punchy', 'toes', 'watching', 'felt', 'performers', 'were', 'playing', 'too', 'safe', 'cutting-edgeThou', 'Shalt', 'Laughfilms', 'last', 'few', 'years', 'one', 'been', 'declawed', 'audience', 'protection']",N/A

981277,A1G3TFQRYJRTAU,B000F1IO0W,"Phillip Dacus ""Meeds Met""","[5, 10]","I want to start out this review on a positive note. In order to do this, I must start out with a comparrison of this video to a very successful one.I recently rented ""Apostles of Comedy"" on a recommendation from a good friend. I've had sooo many bad experiences with ""Christian Comedians"", but that one was truly was a joy to watch. It was easily the best Christian Comedians I've ever heard.After that one, I had my confidence and faith in Christian Comedy restored. So, I decided to take a chance on another one that seemed to be recommended closely to the Apostles of Comedy. So off I went to my queue and requested it.When I received the video, I held by breath, hoped and prayed for a positive experience.What a complete and utter failure. It started off with behind the scenes shots of the comics. I have no idea why these Christian Comedian movie makers view it as necessary to show us the life and times of the comedians. Especially at the front. The behind the scenes stuff seemed poorly done and not relevant, so immediately I had a bad taste in my mouth.Then the comedians started up...it went from bad to worse. The comedy was very bad and their delivery was worse. Some of the routines could have actually been funny if they had been delivered better.Timing...Timing... Timing... and Delivery... Delivery... Delivery....These guys had none of this.If its good clean comedy that you crave, dont bother with this one. Run, dont wall to the ""Aposltes of Comedy"" and dont look back!",1,A comlpete dissapointment!,1233878400,"02 6, 2009",2009,1491,"['want', 'start', 'out', 'review', 'positive', 'note', 'order', 'do', 'must', 'start', 'out', 'comparrison', 'video', 'very', 'successful', 'one.I', 'recently', 'rented', 'Apostles', 'Comedy', 'recommendation', 'good', 'friend', ""'ve"", 'had', 'sooo', 'many', 'bad', 'experiences', 'Christian', 'Comedians', 'one', 'was', 'truly', 'was', 'joy', 'watch', 'was', 'easily', 'best', 'Christian', 'Comedians', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'heard.After', 'one', 'had', 'confidence', 'faith', 'Christian', 'Comedy', 'restored', 'So', 'decided', 'take', 'chance', 'one', 'seemed', 'be', 'recommended', 'closely', 'Apostles', 'Comedy', 'went', 'queue', 'requested', 'it.When', 'received', 'video', 'held', 'breath', 'hoped', 'prayed', 'positive', 'complete', 'utter', 'failure', 'started', 'off', 'scenes', 'shots', 'comics', 'have', 'idea', 'why', 'Christian', 'Comedian', 'movie', 'makers', 'view', 'necessary', 'show', 'life', 'times', 'comedians', 'Especially', 'front', 'scenes', 'stuff', 'seemed', 'poorly', 'done', 'not', 'relevant', 'immediately', 'had', 'bad', 'taste', 'mouth.Then', 'comedians', 'started', 'up', 'went', 'bad', 'worse', 'comedy', 'was', 'very', 'bad', 'delivery', 'was', 'worse', 'routines', 'could', 'have', 'actually', 'been', 'funny', 'had', 'been', 'delivered', 'better.Timing', 'Timing', 'Timing', 'Delivery', 'Delivery', 'Delivery', '.These', 'guys', 'had', 'none', 'this.If', 'good', 'clean', 'comedy', 'crave', 'bother', 'one', 'Run', 'dont', 'wall', 'Aposltes', 'Comedy', 'dont', 'look', 'back']",N/A
