Certainly not a bad film, but also not one of the better ones of the genre.Rhonda Fleming is lovely as always, but the whole affairs comes off as pretty lightweight.Of more concern was the poor quality of the film transfer.  I have ordered quite a few of the dvd-rburn-on-demand studio archive titles and have found very inconsistant quality across the board.Some transfers appear clean and crisp while others appear faded with poor resolution.  This mightbe acceptable if these titles were sold cheaply, but at close to $20 a disc, the studios need to doa much better job.",3,"Decent Film, Poor Transfer",1370476800,"06 6, 2013",2013,673,"['was', 'little', 'disappointed', 'purchase', 'film', 'was', 'pretty', 'standardpirate', 'tale', 'Certainly', 'not', 'bad', 'film', 'also', 'not', 'one', 'better', 'ones', 'genre.Rhonda', 'Fleming', 'lovely', 'always', 'whole', 'affairs', 'off', 'pretty', 'lightweight.Of', 'more', 'concern', 'was', 'poor', 'quality', 'film', 'transfer', 'have', 'ordered', 'quite', 'few', 'dvd-rburn-on-demand', 'studio', 'archive', 'titles', 'have', 'found', 'very', 'inconsistant', 'quality', 'board.Some', 'transfers', 'appear', 'clean', 'crisp', 'others', 'appear', 'faded', 'poor', 'resolution', 'mightbe', 'acceptable', 'titles', 'were', 'sold', 'cheaply', 'close', '20', 'disc', 'studios', 'need', 'doa', 'much', 'better', 'job']",The Golden Hawk
