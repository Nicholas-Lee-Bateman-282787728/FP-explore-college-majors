I think I actually prefer his Ali G character more than Borat.  It's amazing how he convinces professionals in highly respected fields (the police force, CIA, religious figures, congressmen, politicians, and so on) to go on interviews.  He asks them the dumbest questions which is what makes it all so hilarious.  If you have any hesitations of purchasing it, just go to the youtube website and watch a clip of the skit called  ""ice cream glove"" in which he pitches an idea to Donald Trump and a plethora of other highly influential business leaders about the importance of gloves when eating ice cream. There is also a skit in which he is trying to publish a book, and he tells the publishers that he wrote a book on the film ""The Lord of the Ring"" without realizing that the film is based on a book.In all seriousness, the skits when Borat goes to America hold a deeper meaning for me.  I believe that Borat is trying to bring to light the conservative views and values of the Southern United States, kind of telling and explaining to the rest of the world why Bush was reelected.  He wants to demonstrate how conservative our country really is, and how the older generations are still pretty ignorant about their views on race, homosexuals and other minority groups or groups with opposing views.  Even in his major US film release, he stopped at a church in Texas where there were judges and congressmen preaching in a church.  I believe in the seperation of church and state.Anyway...the DVD is excellent, and in case you are wondering it does work in the US region.

1025672,AY12DBB0U420B,B000JBXH82,Gary Peterson,"[17, 20]","My rather abrupt introduction to comedian Sacha Baron Cohen was in the ""Borat"" movie. I read an interesting review and went to see it. It was a bit of a shock, to say the least. I was laughing at the opening credits and it just got better and better. Cohen must be a comic genius to create a character simultaneously appealing and appalling and funny, funny, funny. My companion and I were laughing about the movie for weeks thereafter. Then, on Christmas Eve a present of  ""Da Ali G Show - Da Compleet Seereez"" appeared as a present under the tree. We watched it over the next several nights. It was outrageous, offensive, and funny, much along the same line as the ""Borat"" movie.Cohen appears as three alter egos: Borat, Bruno and Ali G. In each character he interviews or otherwise reacts with people, some quite prominent, who apparently don't know the situation. Some come off quite well. Some come off as complete fools. Some of the interviews are just embarrassing. How Cohen can get people to step into this kind of situation is a mystery to me but the results can be hilarious and it's fun to see such prominent people set up as a joke. I might add that a lot of people find much of the humor to be juvenile and offensive. Personally, I thought it very funny in that it gets you to laugh at the whole ridiculous human situation and, in the broad sense, you're laughing at yourself. Some people derive deep political meanings out of the humor. I don't. It's just good fun. Relax and have a good laugh.A comparison between the ""Borat"" movie and ""Da Ali G Show"" seems to be in order. Well, I liked the ""Borat"" movie best. First of all, Borat (the character) is the most engaging of the three Cohen characters. Second, the movie has more of a story to it rather than being a series of unrelated vignettes. But, take you choice. Both are first-rate entertainment from a comic genious.

1025673,A3A4WQL80WOTMH,B000JBXH82,Green Manalishi,"[2, 2]","The movie Ali G wasn't very funny but this HBO box set of the Da Ali G show is easily as funny as either movie ""Borat"" or ""Bruno"", which were true tear-jerkers.  Da Ali G Show, less than a half hour per episode, divides into one part Ali G, one part Borat, and one part Bruno.  So actually if you're just getting into Sacha Baron Cohen this is a good place to start.  Special features include some unreleased stuff, mostly hilarious, a Harvard guest speech at graduation, and a commentary over the first show of the first season with one of the crew and Cohen himself.  I would've liked to have heard how they finally got license to put this stuff on the show - I suppose it's a journalistic right to publish anything if an interviewee grants you an interview?  I wonder if the ""guests"" on his show receive any royalties from HBO or the DVD, etc...There are only 6 shows per season, so that's around 3 hours total per season.  The box set is obviously a good deal for a total of 6 hours.  Both seasons are rivitingly hilarious, though if I had to choose perhaps I'd choose the second as better than the first, though there were lots of good stuff in both and it's very easy to watch a whole season in one sitting.  You don't want to stop.  And it's amazing the guests he gets on his show - Sam Donaldson from ABC news, Andy Rooney from 60 minutes (he doesn't take too much of Ali G's crap), ministers, men of science, women in all walks of life, Darryl Gates LAPD police cheif, a guy from the DEA, former presidential advisors, Noam Chomsky, fashion gurus, club owners, all variety of everyday people - he's relentless.  It's almost surreal to see these distinguished personages being interviewed by the likes of Ali G.I've just ordered a few sets of the British stuff which was made prior to this HBO production and is shot in England.  I'm assuming I won't recognize many of the interviewees on that show.  Yes, I have a 'region-free' DVD player which will make this viewing possible (UK = PAL region 2 discs that don't play on standard US players).  Reading customer reviews on those discs (on Amazon.uk) I recall one reviewer comparing the UK stuff to the later HBO stuff shot in America, and she said something like 'perhaps we don't take ourselves quite as seriously as those in America..""  I haven't seen the UK stuff yet, so I can't really compare yet, but it just seems to me it would be easier to victimize Americans more easily than British, because Ali G is British, so first of all, no one in England is going to be looking at him as a ""foreigner"" to begin with.  He accent, while obviously tripped out to the rastafarian umpth degree is still British so it seems like it would still be a little harder to put over on your own people.  Whereas in the States, Ali G's British accent alone makes him slightly exotic - add to that all the other stuff and these poor interviewees are really just trying to comprehend how ""different"" the world is beyond our borders.  And this is not even bringing up Borat.  Anyway, it's a good expirament and a fun one to watch.  It's truly unique in the annals of comedy that someone could pull this off.  If you haven't seen the Ali G Show yet and you liked ""Borat"" or ""Bruno"" the movies, don't hesitate.

BTW - Bruno was my favorite and I'm looking forward to the movie in mid July 2009. I've never seen ""Borat"" and never will now after seeing this DVD set. The best thing about Ali G was the opening sequence of each episode - the suit up. The whip snapping sound of the waist band on his Tommy H shorts was priceless. Still cracks me up.Quote from another reviewer:""You end up feeling sorry for the people he interviews instead of laughing at them, and at the same time respecting them for tolerating Mr. Cohen..."" That about sums it ALL up. One segment (repeated twice during the seasons) comes to mind is when Borat has a room full of people stand up and have 10 minutes of silence (for whatever).

So think about comparing the price of the individual first and second season releases to this combo pack before you buy. The DVDs arrived earlier this week, my older son and I watched all 12 episodes in two nights, and we laughed out loud like it was the first time we ever saw the show. Well, actually it was the first time my son saw the show, and he got his first lessons in Socratic Irony.The Ali G character is funny, and remember it is this series that also introduced theBoratandBr&uuml;nocharacters to the US as well. Sacha Baron Cohen takes his characters, puts them in interview mode with unassuming real people--often famous people--that believe they are actually participating in some kind of talk show. And the result is usually hilarity. The funniest part being the reaction to each character by the people that he is duping. Cohen's Ali G character (a stereotypical hip-hop, British ghetto banger TV host), Borat (a Kazakhstani reporter naive to US culture), and Br&uuml;no (a stereotypical gay mannerismed TV host) have the same modus operandi....And that modus operandi is Socratic Irony; Cohen's characters deliberately feign ignorance in order to expose weakness in the commitment that people have to being so politically correct that they almost always seriously (attempt to) answer the ridiculous opinions and questions that Cohen's characters come up with. Hence, his victims look equally stupid.The only victim that I ever saw that had enough intelligence to quickly walk out of the situation without any regard to whether or not he was offending a Cohen character (Ali G) was Donald Trump.Even if you were a fan of this show almost 10 years ago now, trust me when I say that if the last time you saw the show (like me) was when it was on HBO, you will enjoy watching these episodes again today just as if it were the first time you were seeing them.If you've never seen this show: Check. It. Out. But don't be fooled into being offended by any of the Cohen characters. They are not real; the man behind the mask really isn't that stupid. He's trying to make YOU look stupid. And if you take Cohen's characters seriously, you will indeed look stupid. You see?
