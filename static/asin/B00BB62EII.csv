1623843,A2IY9M330NKBW6,B00BB62EII,Eric Sanberg,"[0, 0]","Now and then a movie comes along that throws me for a loop. I sit and enjoy it, but can't really figure out if it was any good or not. This is one of those movies.Here's the scoop. Lauduree (Perla Haney-Jardine) is a budding and exceptionally bright girl whose mother has just ditched her to try and make it as a makeup artist in Hollywood. Lauduree is in the middle of some plant based experiments to try to determine shifting weather patterns. She needs to keep mom's disappearance on the down low to stay in the game. Grandma Greta (Amy Madigan) finds out and does her best to help. Lauduree's teacher, Ms. Markovi (Lili Taylor) is also in to help as best she can. Can water find it's own level here?This is writer/director Jenny Deller's expansion of her earlier short film also starring Perla. It was a wise choice to keep her because she's mostly what's happening here. Madigan does a really good job and Taylor is okay, but it's Perla who steals the show. She gives a very believable performance. She's smart, cocky and tough but also struggles with the confusion of her coming of age. When she tries on mom's shoes or makeup curiosity/confusion is all over her. She has a gangly walk and just hasn't grown into herself yet. And her friendship with a bright, sweet classmate Neel allows her to stick her toe in the water for that first kiss, but you see she isn't quite ready. But she's passionate about our planet and is diligent in her record keeping of her experiment. She figures she might not have a future. One scene, where she goes off on a bunch of bystanders about our abuse of the planet is a bit much but it gives Perla a chance to let loose.This is directed and shot nicely and sports a lot of nice music. It's an indy flick through and through. It does have both a story and character arc so it's not like a slice of lifer where it just stops. I enjoyed watching it very much, but I don't know that I'd revisit it.",4,Yes I Liked It.

1623844,A27H9DOUGY9FOS,B00BB62EII,"K. Harris ""Film aficionado""","[1, 1]","I had never heard of the indie ""Future Weather"" by first time writer/director Jenny Deller before sitting down to watch it.  And this lack of expectation probably served me well.  A very small picture, ""Future Weather"" paints a vivid portrait of small town life, a girl's search for purpose, and the restructuring of a fractured family.  With strong supporting turns from Lili Taylor and Amy Madigan (one of my choices for the most underrated actress ever), the movie is both smart and grounded.  But what makes this effort stand out has got to be its young star, Perla Haney-Jardine.  Front and center in almost every scene, Haney-Jardine creates a truly original protagonist.  Her character, Lauduree, is not the typical representation of teen angst that you've seen a dozen time before.  Instead, she plays the savvy outsider.  Instead of confronting the difficulties in her personal life, she chooses instead to focus on a myriad of ecological concerns.  But in many ways, this obsession stands as both a metaphor for her troubles and a defense mechanism against the emotional unpleasantness of her upbringing.Small Spoilers in synopsis:As the movie opens, Lauduree has just been abandoned by her mother (Marin Ireland) who goes to Hollywood to pursue her dreams.  With limited provisions, it is her mother's wishes that she turn to her grandmother (Madigan) for support.  Lauduree, however, tries to go it alone.  She acts as if everything is perfectly normal and throws herself into her environmental experiments.  She is wary of others, nor is she particularly nice, and this standoffishness keeps her in isolation.  Soon, though, the cracks start showing and her secret will be exposed.  Very subtly, people start coming into her life.  Interacting with a concerned teacher (Taylor), an awkward classmate, her estranged grandmother, and her grandmother's beau (William Sadler), Lauduree maintains her distance.  But her entire world has changed and it's up to her to evolve or be left behind.  And it is this struggle (whether conscious or unconscious) that is the core of the movie.End Spoilers and synopsisReally, though, ""Future Weather"" is not about big plot points or major revelations.  Much of the drama exists entirely in the mind of Haney-Jardine.  In a bold choice, she completely underplays the role.  This is not sentimental treacle, and it might have been in other hands.  This is both difficult and real.  And Haney-Jardine, oftentimes with little dialogue, seems to scrutinize everything around her.  Incredibly smart and stubborn, her deadpan mannerism is perfectly suited to the character she plays.  Taylor is also great, as is Sadler (not nearly as scary as some of his roles depict).  But it's especially good to see Madigan in full force.  As she and Haney-Jardine square off, the picture comes alive.  ""Future Weather"" isn't for everyone, but for those who appreciate quiet character pieces.  It says a lot by saying less.Bonus Features:  There are some deleted scenes, but most interesting is the short film ""Save The Future.""  This video short from 2009 is the basis for the feature presentation and also stars Haney-Jardine as Lauduree.

1623847,A1KMG1AIUS00DC,B00BB62EII,"The Movie Man ""tenebre89""","[2, 3]","""Future Weather"" finds a bright young girl trying to spread the word about climate change while her personal world is collapsing.  Launduree (Perla Haney-Jardine), age 13, is forever trying to inform her rural Illinois community about the dangers of global warning.  She plants trees wherever possible and lectures her best friend about the importance of mussels to the marine environment.One day she comes home to her trailer park to find a note from her single mom (Marin Ireland) saying she has gone off to Hollywood to follow her dream of being a makeup artist to the stars.  All she leaves behind is $50.  Still, Launduree clings to her home and a school carbon dioxide experiement.  But her grandmother (Amy Madigan) has other plans.  Thrust together, they learn to trust each other in the face of an uncertain future.The film works best as a character study of a youngster too intelligent for her environment and Ms. Hanley-Jardine does an admirable job anchoring the movie.  Ms. Madigan as a hard-working, hard-drinking blue-collar woman overcomes the stereotypical aspects of the role.  The picture calls attention not only to climate change, but also to the concern of the young about the planet they will inherit.Bonus features include deleted scenes and the short film, ""Save the Future.""",4,Young girl fears for the planet,1366502400,"04 21, 2013",2013,1300,"['Future', 'Weather', 'bright', 'young', 'girl', 'trying', 'spread', 'word', 'climate', 'change', 'personal', 'world', 'collapsing', 'Launduree', 'Perla', 'Haney-Jardine', 'age', '13', 'forever', 'trying', 'inform', 'rural', 'Illinois', 'community', 'dangers', 'global', 'warning', 'plants', 'trees', 'wherever', 'possible', 'best', 'friend', 'importance', 'mussels', 'marine', 'environment.One', 'day', 'home', 'trailer', 'park', 'find', 'note', 'single', 'mom', 'Marin', 'Ireland', 'saying', 'gone', 'off', 'Hollywood', 'follow', 'dream', 'being', 'makeup', 'artist', 'stars', 'behind', '50', 'Still', 'Launduree', 'clings', 'home', 'school', 'carbon', 'dioxide', 'experiement', 'grandmother', 'Amy', 'Madigan', 'other', 'plans', 'Thrust', 'together', 'learn', 'trust', 'other', 'face', 'uncertain', 'future.The', 'film', 'best', 'character', 'study', 'youngster', 'too', 'intelligent', 'environment', 'Ms.', 'Hanley-Jardine', 'admirable', 'job', 'anchoring', 'movie', 'Ms.', 'Madigan', 'hard-working', 'hard-drinking', 'blue-collar', 'woman', 'stereotypical', 'aspects', 'role', 'picture', 'attention', 'not', 'only', 'climate', 'change', 'also', 'concern', 'young', 'planet', 'will', 'inherit.Bonus', 'features', 'include', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'short', 'film', 'Save', 'Future']",Future Weather
