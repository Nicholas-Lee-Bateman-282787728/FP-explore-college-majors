I have seen better quality on Japanese region-free video CD's.  Can you say huge boxy pixels boys and girls?  The graininess of the disc is beyond grainy.  It's like a 4th or 5th generation VHS copy, or like satellite TV in snow or heavy rain.  The sound and washed-out color match the grain.  I strongly recommend a high quality DVD player if you wish to view the PFE disc without video hang-ups.  I tried several players before it actually cooperated with one.This is a story that a high-dollar studio needs to buy rights to, then remaster in the best format available and ask whatever price they want.

Alvie and Boots are very solidly played by Mark Miller and Donovan Scott as opposite sides of the same coin, with Miller's Alvie being the more hardened of the two.

Alvie wants someone to love him, Savannah needs attention, and Bootsie just wants to take care of someone.  When chance and circumstances put these three together, they become a perfect fit.

449033,A19YV8QY3NZBKL,6305112924,"LivinforJesus ""Holly""","[0, 0]","I thought i had rented this years ago from the local video store, but i guess not as i did not remember it after seeing it. It is so nice to own, tho. Bridgette Andersen is just a little doll. The cover i own has a stylized orange early 80's logo with a cut-out of Savannah behind it, i'm glad i bought it when i did as this cover is not currently available. There appear to be about 4 covers to choose from.Savannah's snooty and image-obsessed parents (well, actually her dad) are absorbed in political affairs to the point of near neglect so she decides to run away. She leaves a hand written note (which we see not fully completed, and thus do not see her reason written for running away) on her parents' nightstand, but it blows under the bed and is not discovered til much later. Savannah is suppose to be spending the night with her cousins at her aunt's house. Her aunt takes the kids to the park, where Savannah, with her already packed suitcase, makes her getaway. Two petty criminals, lovable but bumbling Bootsie and his more hardened partner, Alvie, are at the park in a stolen station wagon into which Savannah slips. When discovered, Alvie & Bootsie are worried about unintentionally being framed for kidnapping charges and return Savannah to the playground, but she runs after the station wagon. One adventure and mishap after another happens, as the pair decide what to do with the little girl who is slowly softening Alvie's hardened heart and had already captured Bootsie's. Alvie reflects on his days during the depression as a country boy feeling left out, and the unlikely pair of a little girl and hardened man find something in common. Kids will especially enjoy the silly antics of Alvie & Bootsie as they try to rob a local drugstore, but adults will find this to be far fetched.At Savannah's missing, a large scale search ensues with dad's political connections. Savannah's letter is found by the housekeeper, but dad burns it in the fireplace, fearing for his precious image and realizing that since it has been discovered she is a runaway, it was not a kidnapping as thought.The movie features charming scenery and storyline and the talents of country music writer Ken Sutherland. This is a B-ish movie with a bit of language and grittiness, but more depth than you might think for its kind. I would give it a PG rating. It's a unique movie and hard to describe. Points and emotions of the storyline are well developed, and while Savannah and family are reunited at the end, the ending is kind of unclear. Disgusted by her husband's self absorption, Savannah's mom makes it sound like she is leaving him for good, or is it just on the way home? Somehow tho, that adds to the plot rather than detracting from it. The emotional development of the relationship between Alvie, Bootise and Savannah becomes so focused on that the role of Savannah's parents almost becomes a side story. The trio are seen having a picnic, flying a kite, getting icecream, and setting up house together. With the somewhat rural setting and the real life and fictional references, the movie appears to take place in Kentucky (as Bootsy's last name in the movie is McGaffee, the name McGaffee being prevalent in Kentucky in real life), but it it is later revealed to take place in Utah. Pat Morita (waiter Arnold from Happy Days) even shows up in the antics & search as a Catholic priest.Bridgette Andersen was such a precocious and talented little doll; it was so sad to hear about her life being so troubled, spookily enough mirroring the life of Savannah herself.",5,A Sweet Movie,1302825600,"04 15, 2011",2011,3568,"['thought', 'i', 'had', 'rented', 'years', 'ago', 'local', 'video', 'store', 'i', 'guess', 'not', 'i', 'did', 'not', 'remember', 'seeing', 'so', 'nice', 'own', 'tho', 'Bridgette', 'Andersen', 'just', 'little', 'doll', 'cover', 'i', 'own', 'stylized', 'orange', 'early', '80', 'logo', 'cut-out', 'Savannah', ""'m"", 'glad', 'i', 'bought', 'when', 'i', 'did', 'cover', 'not', 'currently', 'available', 'appear', 'be', '4', 'covers', 'choose', 'from.Savannah', 'snooty', 'image-obsessed', 'parents', 'well', 'actually', 'dad', 'are', 'absorbed', 'political', 'affairs', 'point', 'near', 'neglect', 'run', 'away', 'hand', 'written', 'note', 'see', 'not', 'fully', 'completed', 'thus', 'do', 'not', 'see', 'reason', 'written', 'running', 'away', 'parents', 'nightstand', 'bed', 'not', 'discovered', 'til', 'much', 'later', 'Savannah', 'suppose', 'be', 'spending', 'night', 'cousins', 'aunt', 'house', 'aunt', 'kids', 'park', 'where', 'Savannah', 'already', 'packed', 'suitcase', 'getaway', 'Two', 'petty', 'criminals', 'lovable', 'bumbling', 'Bootsie', 'more', 'hardened', 'partner', 'Alvie', 'are', 'park', 'stolen', 'station', 'wagon', 'Savannah', 'slips', 'When', 'discovered', 'Alvie', 'Bootsie', 'are', 'worried', 'unintentionally', 'being', 'framed', 'kidnapping', 'charges', 'return', 'Savannah', 'playground', 'station', 'wagon', 'One', 'adventure', 'mishap', 'happens', 'pair', 'decide', 'what', 'do', 'little', 'girl', 'who', 'slowly', 'softening', 'Alvie', 'hardened', 'heart', 'had', 'already', 'captured', 'Bootsie', 'Alvie', 'days', 'depression', 'country', 'boy', 'feeling', 'left', 'out', 'unlikely', 'pair', 'little', 'girl', 'hardened', 'man', 'find', 'something', 'common', 'Kids', 'will', 'especially', 'enjoy', 'silly', 'antics', 'Alvie', 'Bootsie', 'try', 'rob', 'local', 'drugstore', 'adults', 'will', 'find', 'be', 'far', 'fetched.At', 'Savannah', 'missing', 'large', 'scale', 'search', 'dad', 'political', 'connections', 'Savannah', 'letter', 'found', 'housekeeper', 'burns', 'fireplace', 'fearing', 'precious', 'image', 'realizing', 'been', 'discovered', 'runaway', 'was', 'not', 'kidnapping', 'thought.The', 'movie', 'features', 'charming', 'scenery', 'storyline', 'talents', 'country', 'music', 'writer', 'Ken', 'Sutherland', 'B-ish', 'movie', 'bit', 'language', 'grittiness', 'more', 'depth', 'might', 'think', 'kind', 'would', 'give', 'PG', 'rating', 'unique', 'movie', 'hard', 'describe', 'Points', 'emotions', 'storyline', 'are', 'well', 'developed', 'Savannah', 'family', 'are', 'reunited', 'end', 'ending', 'kind', 'unclear', 'Disgusted', 'husband', 'self', 'absorption', 'Savannah', 'mom', 'leaving', 'good', 'just', 'way', 'home', 'Somehow', 'tho', 'plot', 'rather', 'detracting', 'emotional', 'development', 'relationship', 'Alvie', 'Bootise', 'Savannah', 'so', 'focused', 'role', 'Savannah', 'parents', 'almost', 'side', 'story', 'trio', 'are', 'seen', 'having', 'picnic', 'flying', 'kite', 'getting', 'icecream', 'setting', 'up', 'house', 'together', 'somewhat', 'rural', 'setting', 'real', 'life', 'fictional', 'references', 'movie', 'take', 'place', 'Kentucky', 'Bootsy', 'last', 'name', 'movie', 'McGaffee', 'name', 'McGaffee', 'being', 'prevalent', 'Kentucky', 'real', 'life', 'later', 'revealed', 'take', 'place', 'Utah', 'Pat', 'Morita', 'waiter', 'Arnold', 'Happy', 'Days', 'even', 'up', 'antics', 'search', 'Catholic', 'priest.Bridgette', 'Andersen', 'was', 'such', 'precocious', 'talented', 'little', 'doll', 'was', 'so', 'sad', 'hear', 'life', 'being', 'so', 'troubled', 'spookily', 'enough', 'mirroring', 'life', 'Savannah']",Savannah Smiles VHS

The movie itself gets 4 1/2 to 5 stars, But this version of the movie was in a horrible full frame low res quality copy.  My VHS version which I bought at Sam Goody in the 1990's looked better of the movie before I sold it in a yard sale.  This does not reflect on movie mars at all.  They were quite courteous and offered my money back.  But I wanted my family to enjoy the movie.  It is cheesy flicks that poorly released it not Movie Mars.  It has an FBI warning, so it is legit.  But look for the orange case Savannah Smiles if you want the better Wide Screen Quality of the aspect ratio of 1.851.  The VHS was full screen and looked better than the cheesy flicks edition.The movie is about a politician who cares more about his work than his family, and he needed his wife to make his image look good, to look like a family man.  Savannah has been neglected, and ran away in the park in two criminals car.  The writer of the movie, Mark miller also plays the main star criminal Alvie.  Donnovan Scott Plays Boots.  And Pat Morita is a father of the Catholic Faith.  Good cast, very heart warming.  The criminals want to give her back, she ended up in their car, and one line from the movie when Alvie chucks the ice cream cone out the window hitting the cop on a motorcycle.  When the cop said hello honey to Savannah hiding out in the back seat.  The two criminals asked him who he was referring to.  And he said he was saying hi to their kid.  They made up a story, and the cop was called to another more serious crime.  And Boots said, &#34;Alvie, we have a kid in the back seat.&#34; To which Alvie said, &#34;yeah, one that will get us 25 years or more in the federal pen.&#34;If I am not mistaken it has the white haired guy from Airplane, not Leslie Nielson.

I have to agree with the point about modern kidnappings changing the way we look at this story: Elizabeth Smart's disappearance and return (ironically in the very same area &quot;Savannah Smiles&quot; was filmed) has emphasized how (allegedly) running away can turn out very bad. Children watching this film should never be given the opportunity to consider Savannah's &quot;solution&quot; to unhappiness at home as a possibility.

This movie is so sweet, not quite the man's movie, but more a chick flick. It's about a little rich girl who's father is running for a big position in society, and has really no time for family. He is also a very self centered man. Anyway, to make a long story short, Savannah runs away while playing at the park with her Aunt. She jumps into a car that's parked in the lot, but little does she know they are recently escaped cons. The movie is about these two men that discover Savannah in their car, and then when they find out she's rich, they decide that they want the reward money. Savannah has a wonderful time with these cons (everything we tell our kids not to do with strangers), and I won't tell you anymore, so if you want the movie you'll have to buy it yourself. It is a kid friendly movie, that has a good, tear jerking ending, kind of cheesy, but still it's a sweet movie.

449050,A5A2QE6NECFR5,6305112924,William E. Adams,"[1, 1]","This was not a high-dollar production with big stars, but look at the huge number of positive reviews posted here. Mark Miller, producer, writer and actor, somehow found a way to touch the emotions of the audience. A couple of bumbling minor-league non-violent felons end up in possession of a runaway daughter belonging to a high-profile Utah political power couple. They first want the reward, but since they did not actually stage a kidnapping, they don't want to risk the rap. On the other hand, they are buying the kid food and baby-sitting and cleaning their hideout for her, so they feel they are owed something. During the course of the movie, the irresistable child, supposed to be age six but portrayed by a charmer who was slightly older, changes the men for the better. Her absence changes at least her mother for the better as well. There are a number of big laughs here, a greater number of chuckles, and a few moments for happy tears. I have to highly recommend it. In real life, lead actor Miller went on to marry the woman who played Savannah's mom, while his sidekick got featured roles in the ""Police Academy"" films. The lovely girl who starred, however, met a tragic end after a short unhappy life. (DO NOT TELL YOUR KIDS ABOUT HER FATE UNTIL THEY ARE TOO OLD TO WANT TO WATCH THE MOVIE ANYMORE. YOU CAN LEARN ABOUT IT VIA A FAMOUS ON-LINE ""ENCYCL0PEDIA"" IF YOU WANT TO.
