They start the day off like normal and are in the middle of a lesson when a group of whackos in crazy masks show up with guns at the window. Some of the masks they use are Santa Claus, A mouse, a duck, etc. The teachers and students are then forced into a van and driven off into the even more remote wilderness area where they are trapped in a cave... Now they have to devise a plan and fight for their own survival and try to get away from these kidnappers before its too late. They have to use their brains to get out of this situation. It reminded me of a Lord of the flies type of deal. The ending was a little disturbing to me. They're in a cave and the last kidnapper comes in and it involves spears, wont give it away here but this was scary and quite plausible situation.

And all this is done in a quite believable way.The children are completely believable in their performances, and there are about a dozen children.The only flaw in this neatly done movie is a striving after significance at the very end, where the filmmaker tries to turn it into a Lord of the Flies.

It begins with what she thinks is going to be a normal day, but she, and her students, quickly have their day turned upside down when they are kidnapped by a group of ruthless cutthroats sporting masks and guns. One is wearing a Santa Claus like mask, while the others have on animal masks. They take the teacher and her students at gun point, and lead them to an awaiting van. Then they are driven to an undisclosed location and ordered to jump down into a cave.

It is much better than that crappy, newer version that always tricks me when I flip past the guide on cable.The teacher, Sally, is getting paid roughly a nickel per month, because she has to shack up at the farm house of two of her students' parents.  The farm gets attacked by coyotes - or mutants, I can't remember - and one of the kids, Sidney, has to stay up late TO KILL.  It's foreshadowing people!  His younger brother, Tommy, has a penchant for mutilating dead animals capriciously.  Ahem, foreshadowing.Anyway, the whole classroom gets abducted, including the fat, moron Derek who teases the little kid, the dumpy chick Norrelle who gets her period half way through the movie, and an assorted cast of other pointless characters.  They all know school house songs and dances, a ton of other useless garbage, and only Sid and Tommy know anything about nature, hiking, swimming, or making a fire.They get shoved in an underground cave, and their adventure is just beginning.  They find secret caverns and passageways, and have to swim to their freedom.  Sid gets to see his teacher almost naked, which was clearly one of the high-points of a great movie (before she almost swallowed 5 gallons of water).In the end the kids and the teacher decide to stop running from four douchebags in Halloween masks.  The group makes their stand by setting up traps, pulling night-guard, and preparing for the slaughter.The climax is awesome, and the brutality knows no end.

I didn't even remember how I came to see it or whose home I saw this movie in. I didn't remember the title. I remembered that it scared the crap out of me and gave me recurring nightmares over the years from the first night I saw it up to this day.  I just ordered this movie and plan to watch it a second time, since the first time I saw it 24 years ago, and try to understand how this movie affected me in such a deep way.UPDATE: I finally saw the movie. It is everything I'd imagined it; very thrilling from beginning to end. Among many things three things made this movie excellent; the acting, sound effects  and pacing. There is realistic acting from the entire cast, even the youngest of the children are very charismatic and believable. The sound effects is actually what makes this movie creepy. Most horror movies are loud and jarring from start to end. Fortress starts out silent then gets loud and silent and then loud again, etc... It creates a three dimensional aural suspense that makes a sunny day in the Australian outback as creepy and horrifying as a rainy night in a haunted castle in Transylvania (IE. See the similarly styled setting of the Mad Max movie). See it for the sound if anything. The pacing is spectacular. An actual story is being told and as an audience you get treated with respect by the storyteller. Nothing is wasteful or meaningless. The plot is tight and compact, the themes precise and grotesque so you get an actual movie and not some loud disposable, cheap music video/pop sensation horror flick.",5,Goosebumps!

498072,A26WVK274IA7DN,B00000F3MC,Sarah Bellum,"[3, 4]","(3.5/5 stars) ""Fortress"" is a pretty good little movie that sets its suspenseful tone from the opening scene. Although it is loosely based on a true story, its source material is a fictional novel by Gabrielle Lord. Rachel Ward plays Sally Jones, a teacher in a rural, agrarian Australian town. Her classroom is a one room school, combining several age groups in the same room. This aspect of various age groups provides some catalysts for the plot, as the younger children fail to recognize the nature of their situation and the older children bear some of the brunt of responsibility. With no one at the school except Sally and her class, a group of armed, masked men kidnaps them for ransom. Sally and her group are barricaded inside a cave while the men leave to go demand the ransom. The group attempts their escape and eventually stops at a different cave. This is their fortress, which they will stay and attempt to defend from their kidnappers upon their inevitable return. What makes this movie good is the process this group goes through during this terrifying situation. The emotions they express, the actions they take and the age and personality dynamics make for an entertaining watch. They begin the movie emphasizing their differences, then band together during the course of their ordeal. The performances are better than expected, considering some of the young ages and the fact this was made for cable. I didn't find it to be an outstanding movie, though it has stuck with me after watching it. Definitely worth at least one viewing. The DVD doesn't offer much in the way of extras, though it has two channel stereo and a clean picture.",4,United we stand,1159747200,"10 2, 2006",2006,1655,"['3.5/5', 'stars', 'Fortress', 'pretty', 'good', 'little', 'movie', 'suspenseful', 'tone', 'opening', 'scene', 'loosely', 'based', 'true', 'story', 'source', 'material', 'fictional', 'novel', 'Gabrielle', 'Lord', 'Rachel', 'Ward', 'Sally', 'Jones', 'teacher', 'rural', 'agrarian', 'Australian', 'town', 'classroom', 'one', 'room', 'school', 'combining', 'several', 'age', 'groups', 'same', 'room', 'aspect', 'various', 'age', 'groups', 'catalysts', 'plot', 'younger', 'children', 'fail', 'recognize', 'nature', 'situation', 'older', 'children', 'brunt', 'responsibility', 'one', 'school', 'Sally', 'class', 'group', 'armed', 'masked', 'men', 'kidnaps', 'ransom', 'Sally', 'group', 'are', 'barricaded', 'cave', 'men', 'leave', 'go', 'demand', 'ransom', 'group', 'escape', 'eventually', 'stops', 'different', 'cave', 'fortress', 'will', 'stay', 'attempt', 'defend', 'kidnappers', 'inevitable', 'return', 'What', 'movie', 'good', 'process', 'group', 'terrifying', 'situation', 'emotions', 'express', 'actions', 'take', 'age', 'personality', 'dynamics', 'make', 'entertaining', 'watch', 'begin', 'movie', 'emphasizing', 'differences', 'then', 'band', 'together', 'course', 'ordeal', 'performances', 'are', 'better', 'expected', 'considering', 'young', 'ages', 'fact', 'was', 'made', 'cable', 'did', ""n't"", 'find', 'be', 'outstanding', 'movie', 'stuck', 'watching', 'Definitely', 'worth', 'least', 'one', 'viewing', 'DVD', ""n't"", 'offer', 'much', 'way', 'extras', 'two', 'channel', 'stereo', 'clean', 'picture']",N/A

In fact someone in my family taped it and I watched it over an over.  My sister apparently had nightmares for years.  I never remembered the name and then typed in like ""santa kidnapper"" in google and there it was FORTRESS!For a review, this movie is a classic.  I can't believe more people don't know about this.  I guess they had good parents :)  The story is crazy.  School kids get kidnapped by guys in freaky masks.  They are forced to kill the kidnappers.  Nothing burns an image into your head like the scene where everyone is roaring and stabbing Father Christmas and they show him blankly staring into space.

The plot revolves around a young school teacher and the children of various ages that she teaches in a schoolhouse in Australia. The teacher and the children are kidnapped by men wearing masks who are planning on holding their victims for a hefty ransom and perhaps a little &quot;fun&quot; with the teacher and the eldest girl. The movie is suspenseful and full of action as the victims escape from one holding area to another until the end when they take a stand, make a fortress, and take things into their own hands.Scenes from this movie have stuck with me my whole life. I had nightmares for weeks about the masked bandits coming after me and for awhile I could never look at a Daffy Duck mask the same again. I also vividly remember the students and teacher making a last stand at the old cave where they made their fortress. I was always impressed by how crafty those group of kids were and always hoped I could be as cunning in a similar situation.This is a great movie. Unfortunately, it's very difficult to find. It's rather rare on video, video stores just don't carry it (I've looked in over 20 different ones and not one carries it), and I search the cable guides weekly but haven't seen it listed since around 1990. Hopefully, the fine folks at HBO will wise up and re-release this film on VHS and DVD soon.",5,Survival of the Fittest.,1016150400,"03 15, 2002",2002,1417,"['many', 'people', 'who', 'have', 'seen', 'film', 'saw', 'when', 'was', 'kid', 'early', '1980s', 'HBO', 'plot', 'around', 'young', 'school', 'teacher', 'children', 'various', 'ages', 'schoolhouse', 'Australia', 'teacher', 'children', 'are', 'kidnapped', 'men', 'wearing', 'masks', 'who', 'are', 'planning', 'holding', 'victims', 'hefty', 'ransom', 'perhaps', 'little', 'quot', 'fun', 'quot', 'teacher', 'eldest', 'girl', 'movie', 'suspenseful', 'full', 'action', 'victims', 'escape', 'one', 'holding', 'area', 'end', 'when', 'take', 'stand', 'make', 'fortress', 'take', 'things', 'own', 'hands.Scenes', 'movie', 'have', 'stuck', 'whole', 'life', 'had', 'nightmares', 'weeks', 'masked', 'bandits', 'coming', 'awhile', 'could', 'never', 'look', 'Daffy', 'Duck', 'same', 'again', 'also', 'vividly', 'remember', 'students', 'teacher', 'making', 'last', 'stand', 'old', 'cave', 'where', 'made', 'fortress', 'was', 'always', 'impressed', 'how', 'crafty', 'group', 'kids', 'were', 'always', 'hoped', 'could', 'be', 'cunning', 'similar', 'situation.This', 'great', 'movie', 'Unfortunately', 'very', 'difficult', 'find', 'rather', 'rare', 'video', 'video', 'stores', 'just', 'do', ""n't"", 'carry', ""'ve"", 'looked', '20', 'different', 'ones', 'not', 'one', 'search', 'cable', 'guides', 'weekly', 'have', ""n't"", 'seen', 'listed', '1990', 'Hopefully', 'fine', 'folks', 'HBO', 'will', 'wise', 'up', 're-release', 'film', 'VHS', 'DVD', 'soon']",N/A
