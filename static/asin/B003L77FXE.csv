It's hard to keep that energy going, although it helps that the electricity between Kate Jackson and Bruce Boxleitner could power a Cuisinart.

In Season 4, the cute dialogue comes back stronger and the writers find a way of extending the romantic tension between Lee and Amanda - by giving them a new secret. Sadly, as Kate Jackson had to take care of some medical challenges in real life, the show producers either for contractual reasons, or another, chose to stick to schedule and write around Ms. Jackson's absence by giving her single scenes - and eliminating the Amanda character in almost any of the plot.
