1147905,A2ZB8B7VQONZA6,B00151QYBM,"fmwaalex ""fmwaalex""","[10, 10]","PRAIRIE FEVERCan you imagine how excited I was to see a new film out that stared not only the great Lance Henriksen but also Kevin Sorbo as well, it could only be great. Luckily I was right and this turned out to be one of the most original westerns I have seen, plus not only does it have those two but also some excellent female characters. I remember when this first came out and all I did was look at it in the store and as soon as I got home out from the bag comes this DVD, how did that get there? Turns out my girl had seen me eyeing it and picked it up when I wasn't looking, oh how I love her. So in it went later on that day and it was excellent, now the second time around when I watched it with my grandfather over at his house it was still just as good.The film follows Preston Biggs [Sorbo] a former sheriff who killed his wife by accident when she was being held hostage. Now years later he is still blaming himself and drinking the rest of his life away, until a group of women give him back his life. After being locked up after a bar fight the sheriff offers him a job taking three women [two at first] who apparently have a thing called Prairie Fever back their families. While having to deal with these three women who are all off the wall crazy [it seems] he comes across a woman [Dominique Swain] who just left her husband [Henriksen] tied to the bed back at the town. She is a strong stubborn woman that seems to have a healing touch with the three others, which also drives Biggs crazy because he obviously needs her help. So off he goes and must deal with the husband after his wife, one of the girls ex husband and his brother and some people from Biggs's past. All of this makes for one entertaining movie.Dominique Swain deserves most of the credit for this movie because his script had some very strong and excellent female characters which are not only rare in film in general but definitely in westerns. Plus had to the fact that the story is pretty original and you have one good flick. Directors Stephen Bridgewater and David S. Cass Sr. also did a great job on this film relying more on the character dynamics more so than the usual multi gun shoot out. I don't know if this was made for TV or not though I think it was but the lack of violence adds to the parts that do have it, it was done real well.Kevin Sorbo as usual does a great job on this film bringing his usual swagger to the lead hero role, even though the hero is flawed. Of course Lance Henriksen is great as well in the lead villain role although the ending may surprise you a bit, maybe he isn't that bad. Still the best performances come from the ladies who make this movie what it is, particularly the three with the fever. Jamie Anne Allman is great as Olivia the artist in disguise who her whole life wanted nothing more than to draw, she may not be that crazy considering. Then there is Jillian Armenante who plays Lettie a woman who is insanely religious, mostly because her husband's brother raped her. And then there is a favorite of mine Felicia Day who was wonderful as Blue who is an excellent musician and can get down on a piano. Then there is Dominique Swain the woman who brings the ladies around and helps them trust again after all of them have been very wronged by men in their past.This was a wonderful movie and while not the best western ever made it may be the best from all the recent ones in the past year or two. I would recommend this film not only to western lovers but to film lovers as well. This is a well paced and well put together story that showcases some strong female characters. To all those even slightly interested I would say buy now and skip the rental.",4,"KEVIN SORBO, LANCE HENRIKSEN, AND GREAT FEMALE CASTING",1238976000,"04 6, 2009",2009,3694,"['PRAIRIE', 'FEVERCan', 'imagine', 'how', 'excited', 'was', 'see', 'new', 'film', 'stared', 'not', 'only', 'great', 'Lance', 'Henriksen', 'also', 'Kevin', 'Sorbo', 'as', 'well', 'could', 'only', 'be', 'great', 'Luckily', 'was', 'right', 'turned', 'out', 'be', 'one', 'most', 'original', 'westerns', 'have', 'seen', 'not', 'only', 'have', 'two', 'also', 'excellent', 'female', 'characters', 'remember', 'when', 'first', 'came', 'out', 'did', 'was', 'look', 'store', 'as', 'soon', 'got', 'home', 'bag', 'DVD', 'how', 'did', 'get', 'there', 'out', 'girl', 'had', 'seen', 'eyeing', 'picked', 'up', 'when', 'was', ""n't"", 'looking', 'how', 'love', 'So', 'went', 'later', 'day', 'was', 'excellent', 'now', 'second', 'time', 'when', 'watched', 'grandfather', 'house', 'was', 'still', 'just', 'good.The', 'film', 'Preston', 'Biggs', '[', 'Sorbo', ']', 'former', 'sheriff', 'who', 'killed', 'wife', 'accident', 'when', 'was', 'being', 'held', 'hostage', 'Now', 'years', 'later', 'still', 'blaming', 'drinking', 'rest', 'life', 'away', 'group', 'women', 'give', 'back', 'life', 'being', 'locked', 'up', 'bar', 'fight', 'sheriff', 'job', 'taking', 'three', 'women', '[', 'two', 'first', ']', 'who', 'apparently', 'have', 'thing', 'called', 'Prairie', 'Fever', 'back', 'families', 'having', 'deal', 'three', 'women', 'who', 'are', 'wall', 'crazy', '[', 'woman', '[', 'Dominique', 'Swain', ']', 'who', 'just', 'left', 'husband', '[', 'Henriksen', ']', 'tied', 'bed', 'back', 'town', 'strong', 'stubborn', 'woman', 'have', 'healing', 'touch', 'three', 'others', 'also', 'Biggs', 'crazy', 'obviously', 'help', 'So', 'must', 'deal', 'husband', 'wife', 'one', 'girls', 'ex', 'husband', 'brother', 'people', 'Biggs', 'past', 'one', 'entertaining', 'movie.Dominique', 'Swain', 'most', 'credit', 'movie', 'script', 'had', 'very', 'strong', 'excellent', 'female', 'characters', 'are', 'not', 'only', 'rare', 'film', 'general', 'definitely', 'westerns', 'had', 'fact', 'story', 'pretty', 'original', 'have', 'one', 'good', 'flick', 'Directors', 'Stephen', 'Bridgewater', 'David', 'S.', 'Cass', 'Sr.', 'also', 'did', 'great', 'job', 'film', 'relying', 'more', 'character', 'dynamics', 'more', 'so', 'usual', 'multi', 'gun', 'shoot', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'was', 'made', 'TV', 'not', 'think', 'was', 'lack', 'violence', 'parts', 'do', 'have', 'was', 'done', 'real', 'well.Kevin', 'Sorbo', 'usual', 'great', 'job', 'film', 'bringing', 'usual', 'swagger', 'lead', 'hero', 'role', 'even', 'hero', 'flawed', 'course', 'Lance', 'Henriksen', 'great', 'as', 'well', 'lead', 'villain', 'role', 'ending', 'may', 'surprise', 'bit', 'maybe', ""n't"", 'bad', 'Still', 'best', 'performances', 'come', 'ladies', 'who', 'make', 'movie', 'what', 'particularly', 'three', 'fever', 'Jamie', 'Anne', 'Allman', 'great', 'Olivia', 'artist', 'disguise', 'who', 'whole', 'life', 'wanted', 'nothing', 'more', 'draw', 'may', 'not', 'be', 'crazy', 'considering', 'Then', 'Jillian', 'Armenante', 'who', 'Lettie', 'woman', 'who', 'insanely', 'religious', 'mostly', 'husband', 'brother', 'raped', 'then', 'favorite', 'mine', 'Felicia', 'Day', 'who', 'was', 'wonderful', 'Blue', 'who', 'excellent', 'musician', 'can', 'get', 'down', 'piano', 'Then', 'Dominique', 'Swain', 'woman', 'who', 'ladies', 'trust', 'again', 'have', 'been', 'very', 'wronged', 'men', 'past.This', 'was', 'wonderful', 'movie', 'not', 'best', 'western', 'ever', 'made', 'may', 'be', 'best', 'recent', 'ones', 'past', 'year', 'two', 'would', 'recommend', 'film', 'not', 'only', 'western', 'lovers', 'film', 'lovers', 'as', 'well', 'well', 'paced', 'well', 'put', 'together', 'story', 'strong', 'female', 'characters', 'even', 'slightly', 'interested', 'would', 'say', 'buy', 'now', 'skip', 'rental']",Prairie Fever

I save 5 star ratings for movies that in some way are stellar and considered 5 for this.My apologies to Mr. Sorbo for stereotyping him in the Hercules role that I found entertaining but not overly so.  I watched, enjoyed, but never became a die hard fan of the series.  Maybe I didn't give it a chance.  I know if I saw his name billed in other genres of films I passed them by without consideration.  My mistake, and I will be reconsidering.This is a very watchable and enjoyable western.  The theme is a bit different than your standard shoot 'em up, bang, bang western.  It is about a sheriff (Kevin Sorbo) who, during a bank robbery accidentally kills his wife.  He turns to the bottle and eventually finds himself forced to escort some crazy women with ""Prairie Fever"" to the train station in Carson City to clear a debt owed for a drunken brawl in which he was involved.  Lance Henrickson co-stars as a gambler and cheat (at one point he uses the line ""I'll shoot you graveyard dead"" which is the same line he had in Gunfighters' Moon which is a must have for Western fans).  The women he escorts all have strong supporting roles.  Just a very good, well written and directed film with some borderline fantastic performances.  Story line takes precedence over action sequences in this, however there are action scenes but a little different than you might anticipate.  A lesser degree of predicability than many westerns in this one.If you haven't given westerns in general or Kevin Sorbo a chance this would be a good starting point.  As I said, IMO, WORTH IT!!!
