1528836,A2IY9M330NKBW6,B007A2NREM,Eric Sanberg,"[0, 0]","Sometimes a film maker just knows what he wants to do and does it. Sometimes he's right. Sometimes he's wrong. This one is right in spades.Here's the scoop. Something has gone wrong and a bunch of people have turned into flesh eating zombies. Typical George Romero-ish zombies. But what about Mike and Brent? They're zombies, but they can think, don't crave flesh and move around like normal folk. Mike is dead because he took two bullets in the head. He just doesn't remember how it happened. Brent died during an episode of auto-erotic asphyxiation. All Mike wants to do is go see the girl he loved and propose to here. Brent will do all he can to help Mike, even though some government types are on their tail to bring them back to HQ. So begins this bizarre odyssey.This is a devilishly clever film. It's outrageously funny and even touching at times. The brothers Brett and Drew Pierce, working as both writers and directors, don't have a lot of credits under their belts which makes this an even bigger surprise. They show a deft hand at both tasks which tells me they could go on to have formidable careers as film makers. They pay great attention to small details that underscore the fun they have with the genre. There are also a lot of in jokes and small explorations into the genre as a whole. There is one funny scene involving a conversation on the weaknesses of various boogie men and questions as to how they were discovered and how arbitrary they are. The movie is full of stuff like that.This is modestly budgeted but just enough was spent to raise it comfortably above the level of student film. It seems much of the money was spent on gore effects and they did a really cool job. The craft here, in general, is as good as it needs to be. What this has going for it is good writing, good characters and a great sense of fun. Order up some pizza.

1528838,AAU5MAMZRRR80,B007A2NREM,John Milton,"[1, 2]","When a film comes with an endorsement from horror legend Bruce Campbell (The Evil Dead, Bubba Ho-Tep, Maniac Cop), you're going to pay attention! Campbell stated ""In a world of putrid zombie movies, Dead Heads is a breath of fresh air"".Dead Heads is a 2011 horror comedy that comes with the tagline ""A road trip to die for."" and stars Michael McKiddy (The Retreat, Weenie Roast Massacre) and Ross Kidder (Sam Hell, Caregiver).With a slew of film festival awards and after reading the synopsis, it certainly seemed like Dead Heads had something new to offer the genre; and to be honest I found the film to have a certain level of charm. However, I could not help but feel that the film was simply a road trip/ buddy movie which happened to feature two undead guys as its protagonists. Perhaps I am desensitised to gore etc now but the whole thing felt to me like some hybrid of horror and a forgettable mid-afternoon TV movie.McKiddy very much plays the straight-man of the routine with Kidder almost a caricature of a wacky sidekick and for me, there was little in the way of laughs; and initially, I struggled with the concept of these two zombies still being sentient but this is explained during the movie.The special effects and production values of the film cannot be faulted in the slightest and certainly seems that The Pierce Brothers have spent wisely with their budget. For me, the best character was the zombie hunter McDinkle, as played by Benjamin Webster. In fact, buying the DVD might just be worth it to see the gag reel and the actors cracking up at some of his improvised lines.Awarded a 15 certificate by the BBFC for ""strong bloody gore and language"", Dead Heads is a technically proficient film with decent performances from the cast and effects that certainly don't disappoint.

1528840,A2EDZH51XHFA9B,B007A2NREM,"Robert Beveridge ""xterminal""","[0, 0]","DeadHeads (The Pierce Brothers, 2011)If you watch comedies with any regularity, you've probably seen at least a dozen movies about guys who suddenly realize they've lost the love of their lives and embark on cross-country journeys to get them back with their layabout best friends in tow. DeadHeads keeps to the formula, but with one twist: the guy in question, and his layabout best friend, are both dead. Which doesn't actually change things as much as one might think.Mike (Dead Man Down's Michael McKiddy) and Brent (Sam Hell's Ross Kidder) wake up with no memory of who they are or how they got where they are (the parking lot of a dive bar in rural Colorado) and why there seems to be a greater-than-average amount of carnage is the general vicinity. All of that's soon cleared up: the two are zombies, the place was just hit by a zombie attack, and Mike and Brent really suck at passing for breathers. The only piece of identification on either of them is a ring Mike has, which sparks memories of the girl he was going to propose to. Thus, with nothing better to do, the two of them head east to find Ellie (Lazarus' Natalie Victoria), the girl of Mike's dreams. Along the way, their party is completed by Cheese (Remembering Phil's Markus Taylor), a zombie who is more in line with the run-of-the-mill zombies that surround Mike and Brent (i.e., an unthinking creature with an unending hunger for brains--but despite that he's a nice guy, in a goofy kinda way) and a breather named Cliff (Harry Burkey in his first screen appearance), who has a pickup truck and a lot of time on his hands to drive a trio of zombies across the country (retirement will do that to you). But as they get closer to their goal, they start asking themselves some pointed questions, like why are they sentient when all the rest of the zombies they encounter are brainless?Now, I am not going to try and make a case that this movie is anything other than the stupid zombedy that it is, silly and predictable and nothing necessarily out of the ordinary. But it's still a great amount of fun; the comic timing is perfect more often than not, the movie never takes itself overly seriously (it even takes a few potshots and the conventions of both road comedies and zombedies), and the Pierce brothers, who also wrote, actually spent enough time thinking about the resolution to all this to make it work in about the most satisfying way they could.

Pierce (brothers and son of Bart Pierce who was the special effects photographer of a film you may have heard of - The Evil Dead) who really were able to put together a fun romp in a world of the undead. Speaking of the writer's heritage they did stick a small scene at a drive-in theater that shows them watching The Evil Dead. You probably aren't going to recognize most of the cast in this film though overtime I'm sure we're all going to be hoping to see more of them.Honestly it takes a lot for zombie comedies to impress me. Shaun of the Dead and Zombieland both pulled it off but few others have been able to really make me enjoy them past that. Mix in the fact that I generally hate intelligent zombies and you know I'm going to be watching DeadHeads with a highly critical eye as our two main characters are both intelligent zombies.While it didn't pull off the perfect mix of outbreak and humor of SOTD and Zombieland I found myself fully enjoying DeadHeads. The characters were likable, the situations were mostly entertaining, and the flow was fluid as one scene blended perfectly into the next. Most importantly they took an idea (the buddy road trip to save a relationship) and stuck it into a zombie apocalypse in a way that hasn't been done before! At least not in a film that I've seen!We begin the movie as Mike finds himself trapped in a laboratory and runs to escape whoever had him captured. He quickly stumbles across a full blown zombie apocalypse is in the process of spreading. What he doesn't realize is that he is one of the living dead. He stumbles across another fellow not so quite brain dead brain eater named Brent and they slowly piece together what happened. It goes extra slow as both of seem to be suffering from memory loss that is slowly returning but the emphasis is on slowly.When Mike remembers a woman that he loves they set on a road trip to get him back to the only memory he has that he seems to give a damn about. The journey itself is not easy. They are being hunted by the military, rednecks, a man trying to kill all of the undead, AND they need to get there before the zombie outbreak truly spreads across the globe.Humor ensues as they bring one of of the living dead along with them who seems to be following them like a lost puppy.

1528847,A2LC4CQ9J0A6WS,B007A2NREM,"The Chief ""The Voice of Reason among hyper-in...","[1, 2]","The only thing potential viewers really need to know about this film is that it isn't so much a 'zomedy' as it is a teen romantic comedy...with zombies.  If you're favorable toward teen romantic comedies, then you'll probably like this flick.  If that's not your bag, then even if you are a big zombie movie fan, you'll likely be disappointed.  Instead of 'Shaun of the Dead', 'DeadHeads' is closer to 'Better off Dead'.But, even with that exception, 'DeadHeads' still has other problems.  Michael McKiddy and Ross Kidder are ok as the leads, but few of the other actors measure up.  And while the plot holes aren't as big of a problem, the ridiculous ending was.  For reasons never explained, Michael McKiddy and Ross Kidder are zombies who still have all their faculties while the rest of the horde are the mindless corpses we've grown accustomed to seeing.  Determined to travel cross-country and finally tell his girlfriend his real feelings for her, McKiddy refuses to let a little thing like being dead stand in his way.  With nothing much else going on, Kidder and a trained zombie pet named Cheese decide to go along, not knowing they are also the subject of an intense zombie hunt by inept government forces.  Will McKiddy find true love that transcends the grave, or will he lose his nerve before he even tries?Like I said, more of a romantic comedy/buddy road trip movie than anything else.

1528848,A29XKBB6SEYTN6,B007A2NREM,"Tommy Dooley ""Tom""","[13, 15]","Yes folks this is a Zombie, Comedy, Road Movie with a love interest bags of laughs (you will split your sides - ho ho) and it is great fun. I will give you the basic synopsis. Two Zombies realise that they cannot only still speak but seem to have the ability of free thought, fear and sarcasm too. Mike Kellerman (Michael McKiddy) starts to remember when he was alive and things become clearer when he finds an engagement ring! Yes he was and realises he still is in love - bless. Only problem is he doesn't look his best, he has been dead for three years and apart from the obvious odour issues he has some noticeable bullet holes and his arm keeps falling off.But help comes in the unlikely looking Brent Guthrie (Ross Kidder), a fellow sentient Zombie, who suggests that they ought to deliver the ring anyway just to put the record straight. This they decide to do and start their road trip with a great old guy Cliff and an adopted Zombie called `Cheese' who seems to respond to doggy commands rather than the usual human banter. Like all good road trips they only have one rule and this is? No eating humans - typical.The sub plot comes in an evil drugs company who want them dead or experimented on or both, either way they really need to put some space between each other but it aint gonna be easy as they is some bad bottomed mother fornicator types.This is a film I thought was going to be trashy and the only saving grace being  able to fritter away an hour and a half, and I was way off the mark. It is a genre bender in the talking, thinking Zombie angle, but it really works. They are very aware of their situation and take it with acceptance, humour pathos and lots of cod psychology. There is also a load of real humour, the laugh out loud stuff and not the gross arm eating stuff either. I laughed on more than one occasion and better still I was rooting for these guys. Because no matter how bad thing got they kept on trying and there was real warmth coming from the performances.I think that is why it worked so well, we do have chemistry between all the main players, that and the evil sub plot and the lost love all just combined to make a very enjoyable film indeed. There is a lot of the gore you would expect but it is far from gratuitous. Not just for Zombie fans, not just for comedy fans but for one hundred per cent Zom - Com fans - you know it makes sense.",4,Its a Zom Com!

1528850,ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T,B007A2NREM,Tsuyoshi,"[0, 0]","""DeadHeads"" is a lighthearted genre mix that is not easy to define. Is this a horror? Not exactly. Is this a comedy? It is, but a mildly amusing one. It is more like a zombie movie-meets-comedy-meets-romance, but the film's real originality comes from the main characters Mike (Michael McKiddy) and Brent (Ross Kidder), zombie heroes who walk and talk like humans.The story follows one `undead' Mike, who wakes up to find that three years has passed since the last time he was awake. He has also been transported to a strange place, where he witnesses a zombie outbreak. But the biggest problem for Mike is that he is already dead. More precisely, he has also become a zombie (though he doesn't want to eat humans).Believe me or not, this is part love story and part road movie. Mike decides to take a road trip to find his girlfriend, together with another ""living"" undead Brent, while being chased by zombie hunters hired by some mysterious institute.The idea is very good, though the end result is not impressive. The film's pace is often slack and jokes are obvious. The film stumbles from one silly situation to another, without making a full use of the silliness. Some of the subplots (about who is responsible for the death of Mike) are underdeveloped.
