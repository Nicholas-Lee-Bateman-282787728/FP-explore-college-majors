I thought SB's 9 and 10 were fair at best. I thought my VHS copy of SB 10 was better quality than the one in this set. SB's 13 and 14 were good, but not great. Actually SB 9 and 14 were basically the same copy quality I already had. SB 40 was excellent quality which it should be being the newest.If you don't already own pirated VHS copies already, you should buy these.If you are like me already owning copies of these and looking for better quality, you're not gonna get it.Also, why do teams like the Giants and Cowboys have more games than the Steelers, Raiders and 49ers? Ok this was released before SB 43, I understand. But, the Steelers have had many other great games besides the Super Bowls. What about the 1995 AFC Championship game? The immaculate reception game (which i'm not sure exists). The 1975 AFC Championship game vs oakland? The 1978 and 1979 AFC Championship games? How about the 1979 regular season overtime wins vs the Browns? 1989 wildcard win vs Houston. 1984 upset of 49ers and playoff upset of Denver? Just suggestions.OK I know they're are the 2005 and 2008 SB playoff sets.",3,NFL films finally puts these out!,1223942400,"10 14, 2008",2008,1215,"['OK', ""'ve"", 'had', 'games', 'VHS', 'tapes', 'years', 'bought', 'set', 'seeking', 'better', 'quality', 'did', 'not', 'get', 'thought', 'SB', '9', '10', 'were', 'fair', 'best', 'thought', 'VHS', 'copy', 'SB', '10', 'was', 'better', 'quality', 'one', 'set', 'SB', '13', '14', 'were', 'good', 'not', 'great', 'Actually', 'SB', '9', '14', 'were', 'basically', 'same', 'copy', 'quality', 'already', 'had', 'SB', '40', 'was', 'excellent', 'quality', 'should', 'be', 'being', 'newest.If', 'do', ""n't"", 'already', 'own', 'pirated', 'VHS', 'copies', 'already', 'should', 'buy', 'are', 'already', 'owning', 'copies', 'looking', 'better', 'quality', ""'re"", 'not', 'gon', 'get', 'it.Also', 'why', 'do', 'teams', 'Giants', 'Cowboys', 'have', 'more', 'games', 'Steelers', 'Raiders', '49ers', 'Ok', 'was', 'released', 'SB', '43', 'understand', 'Steelers', 'have', 'had', 'many', 'other', 'great', 'games', 'Super', 'Bowls', 'What', '1995', 'AFC', 'Championship', 'game', 'immaculate', 'reception', 'game', 'i', ""'m"", 'not', 'sure', 'exists', '1975', 'AFC', 'Championship', 'game', 'vs', 'oakland', '1978', '1979', 'AFC', 'Championship', 'games', 'How', '1979', 'regular', 'season', 'overtime', 'Browns', '1989', 'wildcard', 'win', 'vs', 'Houston', '1984', 'upset', '49ers', 'playoff', 'upset', 'Denver', 'Just', 'suggestions.OK', 'know', ""'re"", 'are', '2005', '2008', 'SB', 'playoff', 'sets']",NFL Greatest Games Series: Pittsburgh Steelers Super Bowls

I think Super Bowl IX is very good, Super Bowl XIV is near perfect, and Super Bowl XIII is almost as good as XIV. Super Bowl X was the best Super Bowl game until XIII, and happens to be my favorite, but I must agree with all the other reviewers that the quality for Super Bowl X is lacking. I don't consider it unwatchable, and agree with the reviewer who said the quality doesn't have to be perfect to enjoy this outstanding game, but it's hard to believe they could not have produced a better quality video, since whenever they show the highlights, they are absolutely perfect. I've been able to get several other games from the 70's on a website sportsgames on DVD.net, which I discovered as a link off Amazon.

What did they use to source this? Worn-out VHS?  The older source material COULD HAVE been made better, but the NFL wants us to buy this set now before we re-buy a cleaned up version on Blu-Ray.The radio play-by-play and color commentary would have been a nice surprise, but sadly we're stuck with no choice in the matter.  (only television broadcast audio is available)In the end one of these games occurred before I was even born, so I guess I can't complain THAT much.

I personally picked it up myself for $22 at the Steelers Sideline Stores and this is just great. You get 5 (near) complete broadcasts of the Steelers SB wins. As I noted earlier with ""near"" you are missing pre-game, Network Intro, halftime, and postgame which I am overlooking but if you watched Super Bowl XL and watched the intro into Ford Field with Terrible Towels going nuts you get chills and that is not on this set so you feel kind of cheated. If you bought the Road to XL DVD set you are getting a second copy of Super Bowl XL, but buy it for the 1970s broadcasts.

No, it wasn't filmed in HD. But theres no excuse. ESPN runs crystal clear footage of these 2 games all the time. Its availabe (somewhere).Why any company would release this and try to fool everybody is incomprehensible.The first 2 games look like someone recorded them on an old VHS vcr (with bad reception). Then used the tapes for about 5 years. Then connected another vcr and recorded them again. Then they transferred it to DVD. UN-believably bad. No excuse.And i've read some other reviews that say ""well, the footage is old, what do you expect??....."". Then why does ESPN and other channels run crystal clear footage of these games ALL the time???Games 3 and 4 are ok, not great, definitely not remastered like they should be, but watchable.Game 5, obviously, is perfect.
