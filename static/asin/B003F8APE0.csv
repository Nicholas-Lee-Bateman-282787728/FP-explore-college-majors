While these qualities are important for lesser films, the fact of this delicate and loving love story (I have not seen the ending yet...) is enough by itself to widen the world for old white folks like me.  (I hope there is no sad ending.)Many movies with central gay characters made by people with Asian or ""third world"" identifications carry the theme that true love and caring exists between men more easily than between men and women.  It is as though men can be friends as well as lovers, while a man and a woman, might be one more than the other -- or neither, once they share children.  This would be a regrettable stereotype were it not so universal in semi-pro, gay-themed movies, such that it might represent a stage in social development.  Gay love in society may have to justify itself at others' expense just to rebut the assumption that gay love is a foul business compared to straight love.In any event, movies like this are popping up from all over, as though filmmaking can lift people from social oblivion into full membership in society.

One of the themes is the struggle that one of the guy faces accepting his true feeling for the other--he has this problem because of his own internalized homophobia and because of the expectations of his overly-religious and controlling father.  I guess we've all been there, so most gay men should be able to relate to the basic plot.
