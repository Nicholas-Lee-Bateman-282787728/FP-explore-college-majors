BUT this one is actually quite good and I really do like it. It's a kids' movie, but it's still a genuinely good movie. This whole new franchise has actually grown on me to like it. I think it's a good movie franchise and now little girls and boys everywhere can dress up as a fairy. There are boy fairies in this series too, it's not just for girls, but it's mainly aimed at little girls.The 3D isn't horrible, it's actually well done and pretty. The characters aren't bland or that annoying, some are, but it's mostly okay. I have a feeling the people at Disney used some Pixar people to make the background environments look better and the character design/animation as well.Great movie for kids and people who like these kinds of movies. I think the director and screen writer made the characters easily identifiable with a younger audience because they're fairies but also with adults as well since the adults would probably be watching it with their kids and they don't want the parents to be that bored either. The characters have depth, and complexities that you would find in other Disney movies that isn't just aimed at a younger audience.

But you could still see traces of her cynicism throughout the movie, though Tinker Bell & her had resolved much of their rivalry with each other, & were indeed friends.The music, the storyline, the interaction among all the fairies, kept this movie moving very well, & I was never bored during it.The characters have been very believable throughout all the previous movies, & that has not changed here.This is another excellent addition to the vast library of Disney movies, & is sure to become a classic, as the past 3 Tinker Bell movies have become!",5,Disney/Pixr does it again-another Winner!,1351209600,"10 26, 2012",2012,3089,"['have', 'so', 'enjoyed', 'Tinker', 'Bell', 'movies', 'have', 'come', 'Disney/Pixar', 'studios', 'was', 'not', 'least', 'bit', 'disappointed', 'latest', 'entry.Among', 'faeries', 'Pixie', 'Hollow', 'Tinker', 'Bell', 'always', 'been', 'most', 'adventurous', 'fairy.While', 'life', 'tinker', 'made', 'lot', 'friends', 'insatiable', 'curiosity', 'explore', 'own', 'little', 'nitch', 'Pixie', 'Hollow.Pixie', 'Hollow', 'area', 'Neverland', 'where', 'four', 'seasons', 'side', 'side-Summer', 'Autumn', 'Winter', 'Spring.But', 'Winter', 'always', 'been', 'forbidden', 'enter', 'fairies', 'Spring', 'Summer', 'Autumn', 'cold', 'could', 'very', 'easily', 'damage', 'wings-even', 'causing', 'break', 'not', 'immediately', 'treated.But', ""n't"", 'about', 'stop', 'Tinker', 'Bell.After', 'something', 'wings', 'start', 'glowing', 'very', 'brief', 'trip', 'Winter', 'Wood', 'Tinker', 'Bell', 'fashions', 'winter', 'clothes', 'keep', 'warm', 'away', 'baskets', 'other', 'tinker', 'faeries', 'have', 'made', 'winter', 'faeries.There', 'frost', 'fairy', 'named', 'Periwinkle', 'who', 'was', 'born', 'same', 'child', 'laugh', 'Tinker', 'Bell', 'was', 'born', 'from-which', 'sisters.Tinker', 'Bell', 'Periwinkle', 'are', ""n't"", 'break', 'off', 'friendship', 'just', 'live', 'two', 'different', 'worlds', 'even', 'forbidden.We', 'see', 'Tinker', 'Bell', 'ingenuity', 'making', 'possible', 'Periwinkle', 'visit', 'Tinker', 'Bell', 'world', 'almost', 'disaster', 'frost', 'fairy.We', 'find', 'out', 'Queen', 'Clarion', 'winter', 'lord', 'Lord', 'Malori', 'why', 'forbidden', 'warm', 'weather', 'fairies', 'winter', 'faeries', 'ever', 'be', 'machine', 'Tinker', 'Bell', 'friends', 'Clank', 'Bobble', 'made', 'show', 'Periwinkle', 'warm', 'lands', 'freeze', 'seasons', 'Pixie', 'Hollow', 'Tinker', 'Bell', 'Periwinkle', 'save', 'most', 'important', 'area', 'Neverland-the', 'Pixie', 'Dust', 'Tree', 'source', 'magic', 'indeed', 'very', 'lives', 'Pixies', 'Dust', 'tree', 'links', 'Winter', 'Woods', 'warm', 'lands.Voice', 'casting', 'movie', 'major', 'characters', 'Pixie', 'Hollow.We', 'also', 'see', 'familiar', 'voices', 'as', 'well', 'including', 'Disney', 'alumni', 'Timothy', 'Dalton', 'Mr.', 'Pricklepants', 'Toy', 'Story', '3', 'voice', 'Lord', 'Malori', 'Jodi', 'Benson', 'Little', 'Mermaid', 'fame', 'healing', 'fairy', '.What', 'found', 'very', 'enjoyable', 'was', 'how', 'Tinker', 'Bell', 'former', 'nemesis', 'Vidia-had', 'toned-down', 'cynicism', 'contempt', 'Tinker', 'Bell', 'was', 'undoubtedly', 'due', 'Tinker', 'Bell', 'rescuing', 'previous', 'movie-Tinker', 'Bell', 'Great', 'Fairy', 'Rescue', 'could', 'still', 'see', 'traces', 'cynicism', 'movie', 'Tinker', 'Bell', 'had', 'resolved', 'much', 'rivalry', 'other', 'were', 'indeed', 'friends.The', 'music', 'storyline', 'interaction', 'fairies', 'kept', 'movie', 'moving', 'very', 'well', 'was', 'never', 'bored', 'it.The', 'characters', 'have', 'been', 'very', 'believable', 'previous', 'movies', 'not', 'changed', 'here.This', 'excellent', 'addition', 'vast', 'library', 'Disney', 'movies', 'sure', 'become', 'classic', 'past', '3', 'Tinker', 'Bell', 'movies', 'have', 'become']",N/A

1534323,A2FRKEXDXDN1KI,B007MDB548,Dennis A. Amith (kndy),"[4, 4]","Whenever I review a Tinker Bell, I'm always amazed how each film gets better and better in overall animation and storytelling.  With the release of ""Secret of the wings"", this animated family film is touching, fun and and highly entertaining!Who is Tinker Bell?Tinker Bell, a fictional character that was developed back in 1904 by J.M. Barrie and later on in 1911 in the novel ""Peter and Wendy"" is best known for her appearance in the 1953 Walt Disney film ""Peter Pan"". The character is quite iconic for Disney, as she is quite literally the unofficial mascot for the Walt Disney Company and can be seen in many of their commercials and in 2008, the character received her first animated film which was direct-to-DVD and Blu-ray.After the success of the first ""Tinker Bell"" film in 2008, the whole gang returned for the second film titled ""Tinker Bell and the Lost Treasure"" in 2009,  and in 2010, Tinker Bell returned once more in ""Tinker Bell and the Great Fairy Rescue"".  Now, the fourth film in the series is titled ""Secret of the Wings"" will be released on Blu-ray and DVD but also a Flitterific Fairies Double Pack which includes the Blu-ray+DVD+Digital Copy and a Blu-ray 3D.VIDEO:""Secret of the Wings"" is presented in 1080p High Definition (1:78:1). First let me discuss the animation for this film and the Blu-ray version.  With each Tinker Bell-related film, I have talked about how each film gets better and better when it comes to the computer animation and overall rendering of the models and scenery.  There is more detail with each film and once again, ""Secret of the Wings"" looks vibrant and well-detailed with its colorful presentation.  On Blu-ray, the film is absolutely vibrant, sharp and the details are noticeable in HD.And I can continue to list so many positives from the plants, the clothing, the accessories and the beautiful backgrounds, the lush green grass, the water and ice effects, the trees and even the animals are well detailed with their hair effects. Also, the special effects via CG from the lighting effects utilizing the pixie dust and then my favorite, the animated facial expressions, is just definitely great to look at. Although not a big budget theatrical film, ""Secret of the Wings"" looks absolutely beautiful.But the biggest positive of ""Secret of the Wings"" is that the film was created with 3D in mind.  With the opening introduction of the film, you are greeted with objects that are coming right at you and immediately, you get to see how depth comes to play for this film.From birds or fairies flying towards you, the film also adds depth to show height to various areas of the village that seem as if they are standing apart.  The 3D for this film looks great and it really helps that the film was created with 3D in mind, as opposed to other Disney films that are more 3D depth-based and were not originally created in 3D.AUDIO:As for audio, the film is presented in English 5.1 DTS-HD Master Audio, French and Spanish 5.1 Dolby Digital.  While the film is crystal clear when it comes to the dialogue and music, there are some moments that do utilize the surround channels and effectively uses ambiance to bring the film to life.  While not as immersive as I would have liked, the lossless audio for ""Secret of the Wings"" is still crisp and clear that families will find overall audio to be pleasing.Subtitles are in English SDH, French and Spanish.SPECIAL FEATURES""Secret of the Wings: Flitterific Fairies Double Pack "" comes with the following special features:Pixie Hollow Games Bonus Adventure - (22:34) In this short animated feature with the Disney Fairies, the fairies of Pixie Hollow take part in a Pixie Hollow Games competition.  But can anyone defeat the nine-consecutive Pixie Hollow Games champions, the Storm Fairies?""Great Divide"" Music Video performed by the McClain Sisters - (3:03)""Dig Down Deeper"" Music Video performed by Zendaya (from Pixie Hollow Games) - (3:08)Pixie Preview"" Fright Light - (1:02) A short animated feature about a mouse being chased by a rat.EXTRAS:""Secret of the Wings: Flitterific Fairies Double Pack"" comes with a special lenticular slip cover case (different from the graphic that you see above plus a Blu-ray, DVD, Digital Copy and a Blu-ray 3D version of the film.  The DVD is presented in Widescreen 1:78:1 - Enhanced for 169 televisions.  Subtitles are in Englsh SDH, French and Spanish.JUDGMENT CALL:""Secret of the Wings"" is possibly the most touching Tinker Bell film I have seen thus far!  It's one thing to see Tinker Bell go on adventures and seeing her curiosity always leading her to good things but also bad things if she isn't careful.  The film does have important lessons for children, but the overall story makes for a very entertaining and touching family film.It's an interesting storyline because we are introduced to Tinker Bell's sister, Periwinkle.  And it's rather touching and even emotional because they come from different lands that fairies from both Pixie Hollow and Winter Woods are to never cross to each other's lands.  And for these two sisters who just met with each other, to be forbidden to each other is sad.But of course, this is a Tinker Bell film and she always tries to find a way.But possibly the most memorable scenes are when both try to enjoy each other's company by experiencing the fun and enjoyable things of their two lands.  What beauty can the ice bring?  And of course with Tinker Bell's home, the beauty of flowers, water and butterflies flying in the air.  But when Periwinkle collapses because of the lack of cold weather and ice in Pixie Hollow, it becomes a battle of time to get her to safety before she loses her wings.  And another major trouble hits both lands as the seasons change due to an accident.  And the lives of fairies of both lands become threatened.But as always, Tinker Bell always finds a way to get things fixed!""Secret of the Wings"" will attract younger and older audiences with its friendly screenplay and beautiful animation and music. It's also a film that is very accessible for boys or girls because the cast of characters feature guys and girls as fairies.As for the voice acting, ""Secret of the Wings"" uses major talent for this fourth film and the voice acting was fantastic!  You have Timothy Dalton (""James Bond"" films: ""License to Kill"", ""The Living Daylights"", ""The Tourist"") providing the voice of Lord Milori, Anjelica Huston (""The Addams Family"", ""50/50&#8243;, ""The Royal Tennebaums"") as Queen Clarion, Megan Hilty (""Smash"", ""The Maiden and the Princess"") as Rosetta, Lucy Liu (""Charlie's Angels"", ""Kill Bill"") as Silver Mist and Lucy Hale (""Pretty Little Liars"", ""Privileged"") as Periwinkle.  And pretty much, all the voice talent from the three previous Tinker Bells films are back!  Including Mae Whitman as Tinker Bell, Raven-Symone as Iridessa and Jesse McCartney as Terence, to name a few.As for the Blu-ray release, ""Secret of the Wings: Flitterific Fairies Double Pack"" is outstanding.  The film was created with 3D in mind and this film delivers when it comes to objects or animals coming right at you and also to show great amount of depth as the Fairies and birds fly around Pixie Hollow and Winter Woods.  And as the Blu-ray 3D is effective, the regular Blu-ray looks absolutely gorgeous.  Once again, the animation impressed me with its vibrant colors, sharpness and detail.  You can see the characters blushing, you can see the detail on the flowers to the trees.  Water and ice effects look fantastic!  If anything, I know I gushed about the third film back  in 2010, but ""Secret of the Wings"" for 2012 looks even more impressive!  And  the fact you get four versions of the film (Blu-ray 3D, Blu-ray, DVD and Digital Download) is a plus!And for special features, you get two videos, a very short Pixie Preview of ""Fright Light"" but you also get a 22-minute bonus animated adventure of ""Pixie Hollow Games"" featuring Tinker Bell and friends competing in various athletic games.As for parents who are wondering if this film is scary at all, there really are no scary parts in this film. It's pretty safe!  But of course as parents, you just want to remind the children that there are rules that grownups make, in order to protect people from getting hurt.  And that is a message that is continually driven throughout the film.  But also the importance of love and teamwork.Another magnificent animated film featuring one of Disney's most recognized iconic characters, ""Secret of the Wings' is a touching fantasy/adventure animated family film at its best and a perfect film for the entire family. A film created with 3D in mind, ""Secret of the Wings: Flitterific Fairies Double Pack"" is perfect for those who want to experience the film in 3D, in HD on Blu-ray, DVD or via Digital Copy.  Overall, ""Secret of the Wings"" is a wonderful film for the winter that is highly recommended!",5,Another magnificent animated family film featuring one of Disney's most recognized iconic

1534332,A3GSRSYNOZNBUY,B007MDB548,"D. Zalewski ""Get it, try it, write about it.""","[3, 3]","I've known of Tinker Bell since I was a little girl, mostly from movies such as Peter Pan, Hook, and seeing her flittering about the screen for many things Disney.  Until recently I never watched one of the Tinker Bell fairy movies though.  I had the opportunity to screen Secret of the Wings in 3D while I was in Los Angeles in August, and then rewatched it after receiving the Blu-ray/DVD combo pack to review.Secret of the Wings is the fourth Disney fairies movie and finally explores winter.  The first four movies each focus on a different season.  Winter is often tricky to animate due to the snow.  Of course, Disney does a fabulous job because they make sure to study nature and keep it as real as possible - from the falling snow to the plants used for their clothing.The biggest surprise in Secret of the Wings, besides the Winter Fairies and the Winter Woods, is learning that Tinker Bell has a sister named Periwinkle!  Neither of them knew about the other, so we get to join them as they become fast friends and catch up with each other.  This movie really shows some of the fun quirkiness you'll find between sisters and does well at forging an emotional connection.Unfortunately, there are dangers to warm fairies crossing into the Winter Woods and vice versa.  It's so dangerous that there's even a rule forbidding fairies to cross which upsets the girls.  They don't wish to be separated any longer, but defying this rule causes trouble for the Autumn Woods and threatens life for all fairies.  It takes some serious team work to make everything right again.I really enjoyed this movie (especially in 3D).  The writing is excellent in evoking emotion - I teared up several times the first time I watched it.  And... I still teared up at least once when I watched it again with my daughter.One thing I will say is that this movie is not overly girly.  I know most people will think a fairy movie is for girls, but there are boy fairies in it as well.  I didn't find it to be something that only girls would want to watch - I think most little kids (regardless of being a boy or a girl) would enjoy watching the Secret of the Wings!This movie has lots of positive messages about family, friends, team work, and even parenting.

This marks the fourth movie and there doesn't look to be an end in sight with next year's addition already scheduled. Timing couldn't be better to release the newest sequel since it takes place in the land of Winter and would make the perfect gift for Christmas for any little girl.A curious Tinker Bell ignores the rules of warm fairies and ventures into the forbidden world of winter. Her dangerous excursion leads her to uncover a mysterious secret and almost break a wing . A bizarre glow overcomes her wings during the quick visit, which drives Tinker Bell to return and delve deeper into the winter woods in search of the Keeper of all fairy knowledge.As is usual with Disney's Blu-ray releases, ""Secret of the Wings"" looks fabulous. Its CG animation is clean and picture perfect. A greater amount of visual depth can be felt when watching the 3D version of the film. However, the 2D version is stunning as well. The color schemes are beautiful no matter if the screen is filled with striking whites or darker tones.A 5.1 surround sound mix guarantees maximum audio enjoyment for viewers. The magical sounds of the fairy world, dialogue, and musical score really get a chance to make an impact on home theater audiences. As if there would ever be any question about Disney providing their loyal ""Fairy"" fans with a high quality audio experience.Special features include a bonus 22-minute adventure entitled ""Pixie Hollow Games."" It also contains two music videos by McClain Sisters and Zendaya. There's a never-before-seen preview of ""Fright Light"" and deleted scenes with introductions by the filmmaker as well.The ""Secret of the Wings"" 4-disc combo pack gives Disney collectors every possible format for people to view the movie in. There's a regular DVD, a digital copy to watch on the go, and 2D and 3D Blu-ray versions.

Peri lives in a frosty world ruled by former James Bond Timothy Dalton (who also voiced Mr. Pricklypants in Toy Story 3). Naturally, the twins spend too much time in their respective other lands and adventures ensue.It's a beautifully rendered production, really an art direction triumph. And in Blu-ray, it's especially stunning to see. The songs are by the talented husband and wife duo Valerie Vigoda and Brendan Milburn, who also recently scored a musical version of Toy Story for Disney Cruise Line and have a series of inventive original musicals created for their band, Groovelily.The teen angle has been ramped up in this film, with the addition of more ""hunky"" sprites, almost to the point of being unintentionally humorous, as in one final moment in which a young guy struts onto the scene and says, ""Hey. I'm Sled.""Vigoda and Milburn also wrote songs for Pixie Hollow Games, a 30-minute TV special relegated to bonus features status on this package. What it might lack in budget compared to the more lavish Wings feature, it makes up for in charm and character development.Pixie Hollow Games focuses on two fairies: Rosetta, voiced to perfection by Megan Hilty, and newcomer Chloe, played by Brenda Song (of Zack & Cody and The Social Network). Rosetta may be a garden fairy, but she's a tootsie-toes with more than a touch of OCD. Chloe's atheticism makes the two of them an ""Odd Couple"" and thus fodder for a very entertaining, fast moving and fun little show.The extras are not elaborate, not even on a promotional level, when compared to earlier Tinker Bell releases.

This is funny, because I was just enjoying it, thinking what a good job they've done on this intallment.  But then I realized, she is right.  What's up with the disobedience?  I try and teach my children to come to me and we can talk about something if they disagree with it.  Communication to me, is very important.  I teach my children that we have rules for a reason.  So, despite the fact that I think this was quite a good movie, I wish there were some things that were different.  There is far too much sneaking around and doing things that are against the rules.  I know this would have made the movie, as it is, impossible to make, but...I really don't want my kids to get the idea that if they disobey the rules and sneak around behind my back that great things will happen...because unfortunately that's not always the case.Still, besides my fuddyduddyishness ***word?***, I did think the characters were cute and I liked that they worked together in the end to save the day.  I enjoy a fiestier Tink, and in this one, she's all sweetness.  The animation is excellent and it's visually a beautiful show. It's also great for the imagination.  My children are now running around playing fairies.  So, I gave it 4 stars.

I watched Secret of the Wings last night and thoroughly enjoyed it, and it's easily as good as the other 3 movies, possibly the best yet.

It's wintry setting with all the snow and ice really give the film an enchanting, magical feel. I watched this on Blu-ray (2D) and the picture quality - as expected from Disney - is amazing. The winter setting with it's icy whites and cool blues really look great. This film really deserves to be seen in HD. All of the animation is top notch too - everything from the characters to the beautiful falling snow looks great. Don't think for a minute that because this is a straight-to-video release Disney have knocked out a sub-par release.

When Fawn need help herding animals there she thought she had her chance to explore. Just when her wings start to glow, Fawn pulls her back and tell her its against fairy law for Winter fairies to cross over to their side or warm fairies to cross over into winter. AS she tries to learn more about why her wings glowed she decide to stow away on the next owl pick up to the winter woods after re-designing the outfit she wore in Lost Treasure for winter warmth.

1534460,A11QEQWKLDM8U,B007MDB548,Reviewer,"[4, 5]","Wow!  This must be the best direct-to-video movie we've ever seen.  I sat down with the kids to watch what was only supposed to be a few minutes of this film the other night.  However, I couldn't pull myself away and ended viewing the entire movie with them, complete with a lump in the throat and a smile on my face at the end.  To sum up my experience in a trite phrase, ""I laughed, I cried, it moved me"".  :-)Seriously, I was not expecting much from this film.  I got it because my daughter (age 7) and son (age 9) really enjoyed the other Tinkerbell movies, which we own.  However, I never expected to enjoy it myself, as an adult.  I was greatly mistaken.  In fact, our kids are watching it again (for about the 8th time) with their aunt and uncle (who are also enjoying it very much).Another quick note...  We purchased the 3D/Blu-ray/DVD package.  I can definitively say that the picture quality on the blu-ray is breathtaking!  Additionally, the 3D is amazing!  Definitely a great 3D disc to have if you're looking for more family films to add to your library.Needless to say, this was a great purchase.  I know this movie will be in heavy rotation in our home for years to come.  Highly recommended!P.S.  I read that some people might be concerned about possible ""environmental"" overtones in this film.  Look, I'm politically conservative and am sensitive to outright propaganda, but that is just nowhere in this film.  If someone finds it in this movie, they are probably either ultra sensitive or really, really reaching.  This is just a terrifically fun film for the entire family, with a refreshingly original story-line, and is very moving to boot!  Enjoy!  :-)",5,What a touching little film!

You've ...","[6, 8]","First off, I want to express some dissatisfaction with Amazon and Disney Movie Rewards for not coordinating efforts on DMR's coupon offer. I ended up buying this elsewhere because Amazon does not take DMR coupons. There has got to be a way around this. I would much rather buy it on Amazon and have it delivered to my door.At any rate, Disney has hit it out of the park again with this one. There is a compelling story, surprisingly good animation for a direct to home video movie, good eye candy, great new voices and characters, old characters get appropriate screen time, and it beats the new stuff that Mattel is producing hands down. Monster High started off with a real stinker on DVD, and the Barbie movies are becoming unwatchable. The Tinker Bell movies are all good overall, but this one is probably the best.Fans of the Tinker Bell from Disney's Peter Pan should know that the character has been homogenized for mass consumption in these movies. This is a kinder, gentler Tinker Bell, made to sell toys to little girls. It's not intended for people waxing nostalgic for the little fairy in Peter Pan whose behavior was sometimes a bit sociopathic.In this installment, Tinker Bell meets her sister, a winter fairy who was born from the same baby's laugh as Tinker Bell. Tinker Bell breaks the rules again, because her curiosity is strong and that's just what she does. Winter fairies and spring/summer/autumn fairies cross into each others' worlds, and Tinker Bell and friends must once again save Pixie Hollow and the pixie dust tree.Everything is better with sparkles - The fairy queen's dress is made of pixie dust, and there is plenty of glittery snow, with sparkling wings and other shiny things. The movie is visually appealing and is pretty to watch. Not to mention the handsome new male characters introduced as love interests for other peripheral characters.Hey, it's that guy! - There are plenty of celebrity voices in this edition, including heavy-hitters like Timothy Dalton and Angelica Huston. There are plenty of young, up and coming actors who lent their voices to this too, so there will be celebrity voices that just about everyone will recognize. Even some of the characters are familiar--Dewey appears to be channeling Father Guido Sarducci. This is an old, rather obscure reference that few people will get, but it was interesting to hear this accent on a librarian fairy.The extra features on the 4 disc combo pack are OK. There are 2 music videos and a teaser for the next Tinkerbell feature, along with a mini-movie called Pixie Hollow Games. Whatever you do, do not select the sneak peeks. There are so many of them that go for so long that by the time they're done, the polar ice caps will have melted and the earth will be ruled by dirty apes.I don't see anything here that might be considered inappropriate for children, and I would be comfortable watching this with the whole family. I think that this movie is something you will enjoy if you can accept this version of Tinker Bell, and if you enjoy children's movies in general. This is a great story with great lessons and clean adventure for everyone.",4,Best of the Tinker Bell movies,1350950400,"10 23, 2012",2012,3143,"['First', 'want', 'express', 'dissatisfaction', 'Amazon', 'Disney', 'Movie', 'Rewards', 'not', 'coordinating', 'efforts', 'DMR', 'coupon', 'offer', 'ended', 'up', 'buying', 'elsewhere', 'Amazon', 'not', 'take', 'DMR', 'coupons', 'got', 'be', 'way', 'would', 'much', 'rather', 'buy', 'Amazon', 'have', 'delivered', 'door.At', 'rate', 'Disney', 'hit', 'park', 'again', 'one', 'compelling', 'story', 'surprisingly', 'good', 'animation', 'direct', 'home', 'video', 'movie', 'good', 'eye', 'candy', 'great', 'new', 'voices', 'characters', 'old', 'characters', 'get', 'appropriate', 'screen', 'time', 'new', 'stuff', 'Mattel', 'producing', 'hands', 'down', 'Monster', 'High', 'started', 'off', 'real', 'stinker', 'DVD', 'Barbie', 'movies', 'are', 'becoming', 'unwatchable', 'Tinker', 'Bell', 'movies', 'are', 'good', 'overall', 'one', 'probably', 'best.Fans', 'Tinker', 'Bell', 'Disney', 'Peter', 'Pan', 'should', 'know', 'character', 'been', 'homogenized', 'mass', 'consumption', 'movies', 'kinder', 'gentler', 'Tinker', 'Bell', 'made', 'sell', 'toys', 'little', 'girls', 'not', 'intended', 'people', 'waxing', 'nostalgic', 'little', 'fairy', 'Peter', 'Pan', 'behavior', 'was', 'sometimes', 'bit', 'sociopathic.In', 'installment', 'Tinker', 'Bell', 'sister', 'winter', 'fairy', 'who', 'was', 'born', 'same', 'baby', 'laugh', 'Tinker', 'Bell', 'Tinker', 'Bell', 'rules', 'again', 'curiosity', 'strong', 'just', 'what', 'Winter', 'fairies', 'spring/summer/autumn', 'fairies', 'cross', 'others', 'worlds', 'Tinker', 'Bell', 'friends', 'must', 'once', 'again', 'save', 'Pixie', 'Hollow', 'pixie', 'dust', 'tree.Everything', 'better', 'sparkles', 'fairy', 'queen', 'dress', 'made', 'pixie', 'dust', 'plenty', 'glittery', 'snow', 'sparkling', 'wings', 'other', 'shiny', 'things', 'movie', 'visually', 'appealing', 'pretty', 'watch', 'Not', 'mention', 'handsome', 'new', 'male', 'characters', 'introduced', 'love', 'interests', 'other', 'peripheral', 'characters.Hey', 'guy', 'are', 'plenty', 'celebrity', 'voices', 'edition', 'including', 'heavy-hitters', 'Timothy', 'Dalton', 'Angelica', 'Huston', 'are', 'plenty', 'young', 'up', 'coming', 'actors', 'who', 'lent', 'voices', 'too', 'will', 'be', 'celebrity', 'voices', 'just', 'everyone', 'will', 'recognize', 'Even', 'characters', 'are', 'familiar', 'Dewey', 'be', 'channeling', 'Father', 'Guido', 'Sarducci', 'old', 'rather', 'obscure', 'reference', 'few', 'people', 'will', 'get', 'was', 'interesting', 'hear', 'accent', 'librarian', 'fairy.The', 'extra', 'features', '4', 'disc', 'combo', 'pack', 'are', 'OK', 'are', '2', 'music', 'videos', 'teaser', 'next', 'Tinkerbell', 'feature', 'mini-movie', 'called', 'Pixie', 'Hollow', 'Games', 'do', 'do', 'not', 'select', 'sneak', 'peeks', 'are', 'so', 'many', 'go', 'so', 'long', 'time', ""'re"", 'done', 'polar', 'ice', 'caps', 'will', 'have', 'melted', 'earth', 'will', 'be', 'ruled', 'dirty', 'apes.I', 'do', ""n't"", 'see', 'anything', 'here', 'might', 'be', 'considered', 'inappropriate', 'children', 'would', 'be', 'comfortable', 'watching', 'whole', 'family', 'think', 'movie', 'something', 'will', 'enjoy', 'can', 'accept', 'version', 'Tinker', 'Bell', 'enjoy', 'children', 'movies', 'general', 'great', 'story', 'great', 'lessons', 'clean', 'adventure', 'everyone']",N/A

1534509,A1POFVVXUZR3IQ,B007MDB548,Z Hayes,"[0, 0]","My almost eight-year-old daughter loves the Disney Fairies movies and we have all of the DVDs including this latest title. ""Secret of the Wings"" is our favorite of the series (followed by the first, third, and finally the second in the series) so far. It is a beautiful movie bringing to vivid life the world of the warm fairies and the winter fairies. The storyline is the best in the series so far, in my humble opinion. Tinker Bell makes a startling discovery in this story - she has a sister named Periwinkle. Trouble is, Periwinkle is a winter/frost fairy and the siblings can never be together because they come from different worlds and will face difficulties in each other's world.I loved the creative twists in the plot as Tinker tries her best to find a way to spend time with her newly-found sister. Tinker gets plenty of help from her ever sympathetic friends such as Rosetta, Iridessa, Silver Mist, and even fast-flying fairy Vidia, who used to be so mean to Tinker in the past. The theme of sisterly love, the strong bonds of family and friendship, and self-sacrifice is beautifully woven into the plot, making this an engaging watch for both young and old alike. I usually watch the movies with my daughter and found myself particularly captivated by this story. The sneak peek on the DVD indicates there's another Tinker movie coming next year and we wait in anticipation. Meanwhile, this DVD is going to get plenty of repeat viewings by my little one!",5,Magical storytelling for all ages,1353110400,"11 17, 2012",2012,1468,"['almost', 'eight-year-old', 'daughter', 'Disney', 'Fairies', 'movies', 'have', 'DVDs', 'including', 'latest', 'title', 'Secret', 'Wings', 'favorite', 'series', 'followed', 'first', 'third', 'finally', 'second', 'series', 'so', 'far', 'beautiful', 'movie', 'bringing', 'vivid', 'life', 'world', 'warm', 'fairies', 'winter', 'fairies', 'storyline', 'best', 'series', 'so', 'far', 'humble', 'opinion', 'Tinker', 'Bell', 'startling', 'discovery', 'story', 'sister', 'named', 'Periwinkle', 'Trouble', 'Periwinkle', 'winter/frost', 'fairy', 'siblings', 'can', 'never', 'be', 'together', 'come', 'different', 'worlds', 'will', 'face', 'difficulties', 'other', 'world.I', 'loved', 'creative', 'twists', 'plot', 'Tinker', 'best', 'find', 'way', 'spend', 'time', 'newly-found', 'sister', 'Tinker', 'plenty', 'help', 'ever', 'sympathetic', 'friends', 'such', 'Rosetta', 'Iridessa', 'Silver', 'Mist', 'even', 'fast-flying', 'fairy', 'Vidia', 'who', 'used', 'be', 'so', 'mean', 'Tinker', 'past', 'theme', 'sisterly', 'love', 'strong', 'bonds', 'family', 'friendship', 'self-sacrifice', 'beautifully', 'woven', 'plot', 'making', 'engaging', 'watch', 'young', 'old', 'alike', 'usually', 'watch', 'movies', 'daughter', 'found', 'particularly', 'captivated', 'story', 'sneak', 'peek', 'DVD', 'Tinker', 'movie', 'coming', 'next', 'year', 'wait', 'anticipation', 'Meanwhile', 'DVD', 'going', 'get', 'plenty', 'repeat', 'viewings', 'little', 'one']",N/A

I am a 33yr old dad, wife is 30yr old mom, and we both cried the first time we watched this (sad to say right?) Our daughter loves all things Disney because we do as well. Anyone who love Disney and has a little girl will fall in love with this story. I will not ruin any details, but needless to say, this is just as good as all the other mainstream titles (Tangled, Wreck it Ralph, and all of the AMAZING movies like Little Mermaid, Beauty and the Beast, etc.) The thing our household seems to love the most is the fact that it truly tales a story that flows in and out of characters, world areas, events, and conclusions.A wonderful addition to a little princess' collection....and a great value to boot!",5,An amazing Disney New Classic,1383696000,"11 6, 2013",2013,752,"['Absolutely', 'amazing', 'movie', 'mean', 'really', 'am', '33yr', 'old', 'dad', 'wife', '30yr', 'old', 'mom', 'cried', 'first', 'time', 'watched', 'sad', 'say', 'right', 'daughter', 'things', 'Disney', 'do', 'as', 'well', 'Anyone', 'who', 'love', 'Disney', 'little', 'girl', 'will', 'fall', 'love', 'story', 'will', 'not', 'ruin', 'details', 'needless', 'say', 'just', 'as', 'good', 'other', 'mainstream', 'titles', 'Tangled', 'Wreck', 'Ralph', 'AMAZING', 'movies', 'Little', 'Mermaid', 'Beauty', 'Beast', 'etc', 'thing', 'household', 'love', 'most', 'fact', 'story', 'characters', 'world', 'areas', 'events', 'conclusions.A', 'wonderful', 'addition', 'little', 'princess', 'collection', '.and', 'great', 'value', 'boot']",N/A
