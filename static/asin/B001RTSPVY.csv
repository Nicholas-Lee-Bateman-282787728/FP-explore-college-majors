1234072,A3NQU1649SH0Q4,B001RTSPVY,"Allen Smalling ""Eclectic Reader,""","[1, 1]","Despite Amazon's slighting reference to BREAKING BAD as ""water-cooler drama,"" it is actually in Season 2 that the series begins to break the bounds of permissible serial drama and reach for greatness.  Season 1 established Walter and Jesse as the argumentative meth-making duo that have to ply their craft among homicidal drug dealers and suspicious family members.  (Minor spoilers ensue):  Walter gets kicked out of the house for his inability to explain his long absences from the home while he and Jesse are ""cooking""; Jesse's parents kick him out for presumed fecklessness.  Two new characters enter the cast:  Saul, a glad-handing shyster (Bob Odenkirk ) ever-ready with the quick quip, who helps Walter deal with some of the fiscal and other craziness of his new life; and Jane (Krysten Ritter), Jesse's new landlady and main squeeze.  Only one of these new characters will make it into year three.Despite all the turbulence around them, Season 2 does not ignore the oil-and-water pairing of the stolid academically-trained chemist and the hitherto unmotivated dropout.  This reviewer enjoyed one episode above all:  Episode Nine, ""Four Days Out,"" takes Jesse and Walter into the desert for several days of uninterrupted meth-making, until Jesse, pooh-poohing Walter's instructions, runs the Winnebago's battery dry.  The landlocked duo, in their fear and frustration, remind me mightily of Year Three, Episode 11 of The Sopranos, ""Pine Barrens,"" with Christopher and ""Pauly Walnuts"" similarly stranded.  This blend of the frenzied and the funny establishes the second season of BREAKING BAD as an American classic: must-see TV, sure, but also the impetus for several seasons more.",5,Breaking the rules of serial drama,1397433600,"04 14, 2014",2014,1688,"['Amazon', 'slighting', 'reference', 'BREAKING', 'BAD', 'water-cooler', 'drama', 'actually', 'Season', '2', 'series', 'break', 'bounds', 'permissible', 'serial', 'drama', 'reach', 'greatness', 'Season', '1', 'established', 'Walter', 'Jesse', 'argumentative', 'meth-making', 'duo', 'have', 'ply', 'craft', 'homicidal', 'drug', 'dealers', 'suspicious', 'family', 'members', 'Minor', 'spoilers', 'ensue', 'Walter', 'kicked', 'house', 'inability', 'explain', 'long', 'absences', 'home', 'Jesse', 'are', 'cooking', 'Jesse', 'parents', 'kick', 'out', 'presumed', 'fecklessness', 'Two', 'new', 'characters', 'enter', 'cast', 'Saul', 'glad-handing', 'shyster', 'Bob', 'Odenkirk', 'ever-ready', 'quick', 'quip', 'who', 'Walter', 'deal', 'fiscal', 'other', 'craziness', 'new', 'life', 'Jane', 'Krysten', 'Ritter', 'Jesse', 'new', 'landlady', 'main', 'squeeze', 'Only', 'one', 'new', 'characters', 'will', 'make', 'year', 'three.Despite', 'turbulence', 'Season', '2', 'not', 'ignore', 'oil-and-water', 'pairing', 'stolid', 'academically-trained', 'chemist', 'hitherto', 'unmotivated', 'dropout', 'reviewer', 'enjoyed', 'one', 'episode', 'Episode', 'Nine', 'Four', 'Days', 'Out', 'Jesse', 'Walter', 'desert', 'several', 'days', 'uninterrupted', 'meth-making', 'Jesse', 'pooh-poohing', 'Walter', 'instructions', 'Winnebago', 'battery', 'dry', 'landlocked', 'duo', 'fear', 'frustration', 'remind', 'mightily', 'Year', 'Three', 'Episode', '11', 'Sopranos', 'Pine', 'Barrens', 'Christopher', 'Pauly', 'Walnuts', 'similarly', 'stranded', 'blend', 'frenzied', 'funny', 'second', 'season', 'BREAKING', 'BAD', 'American', 'classic', 'must-see', 'TV', 'sure', 'also', 'impetus', 'several', 'seasons', 'more']",Breaking Bad: Season 2

From the jaw dropping opening Pilot (""I only had you in my heart."") to the heartbreaking Felina, the quality of the five seasons never once dropped from Perfect.I could go on. I could talk aboutBryan Cranston's legendary, immortal performance as high school-teacher-turned-meth-chef Walter White. I could talk at length about the jaw-dropping work from Aaron Paul, Anna Gunn, Dean Norris, Giancarlo Esposito, and Bob Odenkirk in their moving, finely crafted roles. I could talk about the perfect use of music and lighting, the camera work and stunning cinematography. I could talk about the writing, sharp and realistic and beautiful. All these and more are the elements (this IS a show about chemistry...) that took Breaking Bad from what it could have been: an entertaining black comedy/drama, into what it is: ""a labyrinth of blood, destruction and hell"" of Shakespearean proportions (words of superfan Anthony Hopkins).But I won't talk about that. I'll just say one thing: watch Breaking Bad. Watch all 57 perfect episodes of it, and when you're done, come back here and drop a comment telling me what you thought. And if I was right...vote Yes.

1234083,A2BW9U1CSLIHJX,B001RTSPVY,Big Erik,"[2, 4]","Season 1 of Breaking Bad was outstanding, and for much of this season, the same can be said.  Character development is improved, and this is especially beneficial for Jessie and Hank--these two are no longer the one note stereotypes the series started them out with.  Jessie, a hyperactive annoyance with a lack of brain power in Season 1, expands his emotional range and depth in Season 2, and Hank, who was a Vic Mackey clone with very little gray area in Breaking Bad 1.0, now has some extra layers, as well as an expanded (and highly entertaining) DEA plot arc.What else is improved?  Overall creativity in the film-making.  From ominous flash forwards, trippy montages cued to expertly chosen music, some incredible cold opens (including a music video), and excellent use fast-motion fixed camera shots, the show has become the best made, most unique-looking experience on television.  Furthermore, it boasts one of the great all-time episodes: ""4 Days Out,"" which is a standalone pressure-cooker and my personal favorite so far.So with all this praise, what goes wrong?  For most viewers, the consensus appears to be nothing, but I believe there were some significant missteps.  Without revealing too many SPOILERS, the following issues were significant enough to drop the rating down one star:1.) In the last quarter of the season, the meth-making angle takes a long hiatus, and the show suffers from a lack of criminal tension (which has previously fueled much of the suspense and success of Breaking Bad as a whole).2.) Jessie's girlfriend is a bit of a cliched plot device--existing as a surrogate tension-maker for the evaporating drug dealing angle--without her, Walt and Jessie wouldn't have any new conflicts.  She essentially becomes a ""Wormtongue"" and is drawn in fairly broad strokes.3.) The ominous flash forwards.  Were they executed well?  Absolutely.  Was I dying to see what they actually pertained to in the finale?  For sure.  Was there a pay off?  In my opinion, while the unveiling was clever, I do not believe the entire season should surround and build up to such a purely metaphorical (but from a plot standpoint unimportant) moment in time.Regardless of my personal opinion of the last quarter of the season, the show as a whole, the style of film making, and the addictive (meth like?) quality of the episodes make this my favorite diversion on television.

I know of no other TV series or movie about an illegal enterprise where you actually witness the ""business"" being put together, almost in real time, while the law desperately scrambles to stop it. That whole process in itself makes for fascinating viewing.Again, this series in no way glorifies drug taking or drug trafficking (quite the opposite), and it's pretty interesting how they manage to make this seem so viscerally realistic without excess profanity or violence.I don't want to go into detail without spoiling the plot, but suffice it to say Bryan Cranston and Aaron Paul continue to be amazing together onscreen.  Anna Gunn gets more screen time, as do Dean Norris and RJ Mitte - and this season they further prove how great the entire cast is.I'll just conclude by saying that the last episode of season two is heartbreaking to watch, but up to this point,  Breaking Bad is one of the best shows I've ever seen and definitely merits repeated viewing.",5,Liked the first season?

Just odd dramatic choices in the story and script.I know this series has been compared to &#34;The Wire,&#34; and in this way it's exactly like that series where Season Two I found the whole thing sort of losing its way a little.Obviously, I'm hoping Season 3 onwards kicks it up a few notches and judging from Episodes 10-13 of this season, it will.

You gotta have AGON!  You can't simply have people getting along and life going swell:  people have to be arguing.But it's as though the writers never made it to the second chapter of that screenwriting book, wherein you learn that agon must arise insuppressibly out of character and circumstance.  Instead, it's like whenever things get slow, they had one character or another start acting irrational just to keep the tension up.  It got so predictable.  At one point, Jesse asks Walt, ""Hey, 6 grand a day we're making! What's your problem?!""It would have been very accurate if Walt had simply retorted: ""Hey, I have to have a problem of some sort!  The script is kinda lagging at this point and we need some yelling to keep the tension up!""In other words, despite its many merits (especially acting), I think this is a good example of a TV show with a premise but no story.  They've got a set-up, but they have no idea what to do with it, so they just keep having the characters go at each other for silly stuff just to keep the drama up.I was totally willing to believe that these two were cooking and selling drugs:  what I was totally unable to swallow was that they'd been cooking and selling drugs for a long time, totally getting away with it, WHILE ALL THE TIME being irresponsible, irrational hotheads who start yelling at each other, showing up in places they aren't supposed to be, and acting in impulsive, improvident ways.  No, no:  people who really do stuff like this and get away with it for years are cautious, circumspect, low-key, and even risk-averse.Interestingly, the point where I turned it off was where Walt starts banging on Jesse's door, creating a totally unnecessary and dangerously risky scene.  I might have been able to buy that hair's-breadth escape at Tuco's grandfather's, but, strange as it sounds, Walt pounding on the door like that stretched believability way too far.",1,I hated this,1279497600,"07 19, 2010",2010,2344,"['feel', 'kinda', 'bad', 'giving', 'one-star', 'review', 'feel', 'first', 'series', 'was', 'compelling', 'superbly-crafted', 'especially', 'first', 'three', 'four', 'episodes', 'bottom', 'line', 'could', ""n't"", 'get', 'more', 'half', 'second', 'season', 'just', 'got', 'so', 'sick', 'writers', 'same', 'lame', 'tricks', 'seemed', 'scriptwriting', 'workshop', 'writers', 'had', 'been', 'told', 'importance', 'having', 'CONFLICT', 'screen', 'got', 'ta', 'have', 'AGON', 'ca', ""n't"", 'simply', 'have', 'people', 'getting', 'along', 'life', 'going', 'swell', 'people', 'have', 'be', 'writers', 'never', 'made', 'second', 'chapter', 'screenwriting', 'book', 'wherein', 'learn', 'agon', 'must', 'arise', 'insuppressibly', 'character', 'circumstance', 'Instead', 'whenever', 'things', 'get', 'slow', 'had', 'one', 'character', 'start', 'acting', 'irrational', 'just', 'keep', 'tension', 'up', 'got', 'so', 'predictable', 'one', 'point', 'Jesse', 'Walt', 'Hey', '6', 'grand', 'day', ""'re"", 'making', 'What', 'problem', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'very', 'accurate', 'Walt', 'had', 'simply', 'retorted', 'Hey', 'have', 'have', 'problem', 'sort', 'script', 'kinda', 'lagging', 'point', 'need', 'yelling', 'keep', 'tension', 'up', 'other', 'words', 'many', 'merits', 'especially', 'acting', 'think', 'good', 'example', 'TV', 'show', 'premise', 'story', ""'ve"", 'got', 'set-up', 'have', 'idea', 'what', 'do', 'just', 'keep', 'having', 'characters', 'go', 'other', 'silly', 'stuff', 'just', 'keep', 'drama', 'up.I', 'was', 'totally', 'willing', 'believe', 'two', 'were', 'cooking', 'selling', 'drugs', 'what', 'was', 'totally', 'unable', 'swallow', 'was', ""'d"", 'been', 'cooking', 'selling', 'drugs', 'long', 'time', 'totally', 'getting', 'away', 'TIME', 'being', 'irresponsible', 'irrational', 'hotheads', 'who', 'start', 'yelling', 'other', 'showing', 'up', 'places', 'are', ""n't"", 'supposed', 'be', 'acting', 'impulsive', 'improvident', 'ways', 'No', 'people', 'who', 'really', 'do', 'stuff', 'get', 'away', 'years', 'are', 'cautious', 'circumspect', 'low-key', 'even', 'risk-averse.Interestingly', 'point', 'where', 'turned', 'off', 'was', 'where', 'Walt', 'banging', 'Jesse', 'door', 'creating', 'totally', 'unnecessary', 'dangerously', 'risky', 'scene', 'might', 'have', 'been', 'able', 'buy', ""hair's-breadth"", 'escape', 'Tuco', 'grandfather', 'strange', 'Walt', 'pounding', 'door', 'stretched', 'believability', 'way', 'too', 'far']",Breaking Bad: Season 2
1234095,AW3VZ5O895LRK,B001RTSPVY,"carol irvin ""carol irvin""","[6, 8]","I would like to give this series 4 stars instead of 5 because I can't say that I enjoy watching it.  However, I can't grade something down because it is too good, too excellent.  It is painful to watch.  This is because the central figure has morphed into being a very tragic figure with nothing but further tragedy looming on the horizon.  Bryan Cranston, previously a situation comedy actor, plays this tragic figure, a high school teacher who learns he has terminal cancer.  His response to this news is a growing and overpowering rage.  He had suppressed this rage up to this point in his life but he had two cancers inside of him.  One was his lung cancer and the other was a cancer of the spirit brought about by his not becoming the big deal in chemistry that he was slated to become along with his best friend.  He screwed that up and ended up being a high school chem teacher.  He also ended up with sky high expenses since he has a son with cerebral palsy and his wife is pregnant again.  In Arthur Miller's ALL MY SONS, the lead character, a father and plane manufacturer during WWII, manufactures faulty planes for WWII pilots.  They fly to their deaths in them.  He lets these flawed planes go because he too wants to be a big deal and cannot handle being a failure.  So he is willing to kill these boys to preserve his own ego.  Likewise, Walt is willing to kill a whole generation of young people by making and selling crystal meth so he can salve his own ego, his own rage at how he did not end up becoming who he should have been.  There are supporting characters too.  His young sometimes partner Jesse is one of these doomed young people, a drug taker who can't get out of his own way.  Even better is his brother-in-law, a DEA agent who is clueless as to Walt's being a drug dealer but supports him in every way in his battle against cancer.  It is difficult to watch an ongoing tragedy unfold weekly but Bryan Cranston is doing the acting job of a lifetime with this character and he has won two consecutive emmy awards for doing so.  It is unbelievable that this is a tv show.  Only now, where there is so much choice in tv, would this be possible.",5,Like An Arthur Miller Play,1250208000,"08 14, 2009",2009,2170,"['would', 'like', 'give', 'series', '4', 'stars', 'instead', '5', 'ca', ""n't"", 'say', 'enjoy', 'watching', 'However', 'ca', ""n't"", 'grade', 'something', 'down', 'too', 'good', 'too', 'excellent', 'painful', 'watch', 'central', 'figure', 'morphed', 'being', 'very', 'tragic', 'figure', 'nothing', 'further', 'tragedy', 'looming', 'horizon', 'Bryan', 'Cranston', 'previously', 'situation', 'comedy', 'actor', 'tragic', 'figure', 'high', 'school', 'teacher', 'who', 'terminal', 'cancer', 'response', 'news', 'growing', 'overpowering', 'rage', 'had', 'suppressed', 'rage', 'up', 'point', 'life', 'had', 'two', 'cancers', 'One', 'was', 'lung', 'cancer', 'other', 'was', 'cancer', 'spirit', 'brought', 'about', 'not', 'becoming', 'big', 'deal', 'chemistry', 'was', 'slated', 'become', 'along', 'best', 'friend', 'screwed', 'ended', 'up', 'being', 'high', 'school', 'chem', 'teacher', 'also', 'ended', 'up', 'sky', 'high', 'expenses', 'son', 'cerebral', 'palsy', 'wife', 'pregnant', 'again', 'Arthur', 'Miller', 'ALL', 'MY', 'SONS', 'lead', 'character', 'father', 'plane', 'manufacturer', 'WWII', 'faulty', 'planes', 'WWII', 'pilots', 'fly', 'deaths', 'flawed', 'planes', 'go', 'too', 'be', 'big', 'deal', 'can', 'not', 'handle', 'being', 'failure', 'willing', 'kill', 'boys', 'preserve', 'own', 'ego', 'Likewise', 'Walt', 'willing', 'kill', 'whole', 'generation', 'young', 'people', 'making', 'selling', 'crystal', 'meth', 'can', 'salve', 'own', 'ego', 'own', 'rage', 'how', 'did', 'not', 'end', 'up', 'becoming', 'who', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'are', 'supporting', 'characters', 'too', 'young', 'sometimes', 'partner', 'Jesse', 'one', 'doomed', 'young', 'people', 'drug', 'taker', 'who', 'ca', ""n't"", 'get', 'own', 'way', 'Even', 'better', 'brother-in-law', 'DEA', 'agent', 'who', 'clueless', 'Walt', 'being', 'drug', 'dealer', 'way', 'battle', 'cancer', 'difficult', 'watch', 'ongoing', 'tragedy', 'unfold', 'weekly', 'Bryan', 'Cranston', 'doing', 'acting', 'job', 'lifetime', 'character', 'won', 'two', 'consecutive', 'emmy', 'awards', 'doing', 'so', 'unbelievable', 'tv', 'show', 'Only', 'now', 'where', 'so', 'much', 'choice', 'tv', 'would', 'be', 'possible']",Breaking Bad: Season 2

The funniest dialogue spills from the mouths of characters not around in the first season.  Skinny Pete's nonchalant delivery of ""Feng Shui, yo!"" comes to mind.  A man of Skinny's limited intelligence would not even know how to spell Feng Shui, let alone pronounce it.  Yet the expression rolls off his tongue as if he were intimately versed in the Chinese concept.  And that's one of the throwaway lines.  The best ones come from Saul Goodman, a one-of-a-kind criminal who happens to be a practicing member of the Bar.  The first time I saw 'Better Call Saul' I thought the suits should give good ol' Saul a show of his own.  And they did!  One can't help but accept Saul's deliberate smarmy approach, his license plate is LWYRUP, typical of his sense of humor.  His multitude of underworld connections yields a number of interesting personalities who aren't funny at all; suffice to say they're scary and realistic people.  Chief among them are Gus, slight in stature, mild-mannered and walks without moving his arms but seethes menace; and the damage control expert to whom Saul conveys complex instructions in cryptic Saul-speak: ""I think we got a wife problem.""Danger keeps looming up more and more around Walter and those he loves.  Jesse has an intense side-story (without Walter but with consequences) that concludes with him holed up in what looks like a native American Indian sweat lodge.  Walt Jr. AKA Flynn becomes quite a forceful personality taking turns hating both his mother and his father.  Flawlessly portrayed but totally unlikable Hank Schrader becomes slightly less overbearing, i.e. a bit more likable.  Not a lot but a bit because some chinks in his armor are divulged.BREAKING BAD Season 2 has a lot going for it, wonderful writing, acting and photography, the outdoor scenes make me want to move to New Mexico.  If one looks closely enough a lot of the pre-credit openers are out-and-out tributes to Sergio Leone.  Clever, subtle, nice.  Why four stars instead of five?  There's only one bad show out of all 13, 'Four Days Out,' with Walter and Jesse stranded in the desert without water for a boring amount of time.  This dispensable episode drags unbearably and, although not laborious to watch, is curiously slow compared to the show's regular frenetic pace and seamless weave of multiple interconnected storylines.  That alone doesn't merit a four-star rating.I felt cheated by the plane crash finale though horrified just the same.  Cheated because the whole second season previewed images of Walter's shattered windshield and body bags in his driveway begging to mislead the viewer into thinking two of the White family die by violence.  The last show of the second season opens by panning back from the driveway to a panoramic wide angle shot that includes the smoke of two separate fires burning behind his house.  I wondered what that meant until Jane's father was revealed as an air traffic controller then immediately knew he would cause a crash.  BREAKING BAD is not a mystery story, per se, it doesn't need such unnecessary misdirection, sufficient tension existed without it.  Those flash forward images DO ratchet up viewer suspense.

Fortunately, we have alternatives.Breaking Bad is the story of Walt White, former brilliant graduate student turned high school chemistry teacher.  His life is bland and unsatisfying, and Walt keeps it chugging along by hiding his many dissatisfactions under a mild facade. He says that he loves his wife, but the couple occupy distant universes.When Walt learns he has late stage cancer he chooses to forgo treatment. His family stages an intervention and, in a moment of rare honesty, Walt tells them that in his entire life, he has never made his own choices. The intervention ends with Walt acceding to his wife Skyler's demand that he undergo chemotherapy. Believing that he has only a couple of years to live, he sets out to give his family a financial security that they lack. Through his DEA brother in law he learns about the money to be made cooking meth. During a ride-along, he meets a former student turned meth peddler; they form a partnership in the crystal meth trade.The world of a meth cook, while grim and uncertain, is stripped of the petty deceits that made his previous life possible. Unable to tell his family what he's doing, he lies. And the lies slowly rip his old life apart.It's a painful story to watch, but an honest one. Well written and acted, as it is, it is also impossible to turn away.Good, honest storytelling always has something to tell us about what it means to be human in a particular time and place.

I like the compelling way Chemistry was expounded in the classroom: not in the boring way it was inflicted on us.  It will certainly stimulate interest in Chemistry, and I will certainly not judge the useful and profitable application of chemistry as I go along with all the 5 star reviews of the plot.Using methylamine instead of flu medicines was ingenious.  I cannot wait to find out how manufacturing will continue when that barrel of methylamine gets used up.  I am glad the lung cancer regressed by 80% so that many more seasons can be possible.  The doctors cannot take credit for the beneficial effects of the self-administered ""supplementary treatment"".There is a a legally prescribed pharmaceutical derivative of dTHC (MJ's active ingredient) which does not make the user ""high"", and is used to stop vomiting in chemotherapy and increase survival rates. I have sometimes wondered why big Pharma bothered to invent this product when the real deal is superior. Being ""high"" when the patient is retching away after chemotherapy may be morally reprehensible, but putting morals aside, the natural version works better.  I have blown locks before with thermite in my younger days, so I can tell from experience that the thermite in season One resembled and represented one of superior professional quality and exquisitely made.  Hint: inserting some thermite into the keyhole as well reduces the amount of thermite necessary, and is quieter, although it will not look as dramatic on TV.I have watched episodes in both seasons so many times I have come to notice that ""Ch"" highlighted with green in the name Michael in the opening credits of each episode is not a chemical element.  ""I"" for iodine could have been used instead in mIchael.  Element 105 Hahnium (Ha) in mic""Ha""el is another alternative, so why ""Ch"".Using chemical symbols ""Br"" (Bromine) and ""Ba"" (Barium) in the title Breaking Bad was innovative.Other elements embedded into actors' names include:N (nitrogen)O (oxygen)S (sulphur) and these are the easy ones.Mo is molybdenum, Es for einsteinium, Re for Rhenium.  We have W for tungsten, V for vanadium, Ar for Argon, Te for tellurium, Po for polonium and so on.I am still wondering what ""Ch"" stands for.

1234119,A2IS16K96YSFDV,B001RTSPVY,Eric Mayforth,"[0, 0]","The first season of Breaking Badsaw Walter White (Bryan Cranston), a struggling high-school chemistry teacher, and his former student Jesse Pinkman (Aaron Paul) join forces to produce and distribute methamphetamine in Albuquerque after Walt is diagnosed with terminal lung cancer.  Season Two was originally broadcast on AMC in the spring of 2009, and this DVD set contains all of that season's 13 episodes as well as special features that discuss the filming and plot.Walt decided to become a drug dealer to ensure financial security for his family after his impending death, but he and Jesse quickly ran into much more trouble than they anticipated--when this season started, they were already responsible for a death and found themselves as a business partner with someone insane (and that's putting it mildly), and their troubles only multiply in Season Two.The blue-colored meth that Walt produces with his vast knowledge of chemistry begins to sell quickly on the streets of the Duke City, and both Walt and Jesse rapidly progress in street smarts, but the unintended consequences of their life of crime escalate throughout this season.  The two live a life of constant danger, do things that they likely thought they would never have to do such as launder money, must associate with many unsavory characters, and have to evade the police, including Walt's brother-in-law, DEA agent Hank Schrader (Dean Norris).The series portrays the tremendous psychological tension Walt suffers in attempting to live a double life and to keep his dealings secret from his wife Skyler (Anna Gunn).  The entire season, but the final episode in particular, shows the extent to which the crimes of Walt and Jesse affect not just them, but Walt's marriage, their families, Walt's old friendships, and total strangers as well.A recurring theme that really arrests the viewer is the sheer number of lies that Walt tells to hide his drug activities as the season progresses.This series is not for children--there are extremely harrowing scenes of the aftereffects of an IED explosion, of a fierce gunfight, and of graphic effects of drug use and addiction.  For those of age, though, ""Breaking Bad"" is an extremely rewarding series--there is great use of symbolism and the show has unexpected plot twists as well as outstanding scenes from the New Mexico desert.  Above all, it probes moral issues by negative example, offering lessons on how not to deal with adversity, fear, and uncertainty.",5,The Saga of Walt and Jesse Continues,1367366400,"05 1, 2013",2013,2477,"['first', 'season', 'Breaking', 'Badsaw', 'Walter', 'White', 'Bryan', 'Cranston', 'struggling', 'high-school', 'chemistry', 'teacher', 'former', 'student', 'Jesse', 'Pinkman', 'Aaron', 'Paul', 'join', 'forces', 'produce', 'distribute', 'methamphetamine', 'Albuquerque', 'Walt', 'diagnosed', 'terminal', 'lung', 'cancer', 'Season', 'Two', 'was', 'originally', 'broadcast', 'AMC', 'spring', '2009', 'DVD', 'set', 'season', '13', 'episodes', 'as', 'well', 'special', 'features', 'discuss', 'filming', 'plot.Walt', 'decided', 'become', 'drug', 'dealer', 'ensure', 'financial', 'security', 'family', 'impending', 'death', 'Jesse', 'quickly', 'ran', 'much', 'more', 'trouble', 'anticipated', 'when', 'season', 'started', 'were', 'already', 'responsible', 'death', 'found', 'business', 'partner', 'someone', 'insane', 'putting', 'mildly', 'troubles', 'only', 'multiply', 'Season', 'Two.The', 'blue-colored', 'meth', 'Walt', 'vast', 'knowledge', 'chemistry', 'sell', 'quickly', 'streets', 'Duke', 'City', 'Walt', 'Jesse', 'rapidly', 'progress', 'street', 'smarts', 'unintended', 'consequences', 'life', 'crime', 'escalate', 'season', 'two', 'live', 'life', 'constant', 'danger', 'do', 'things', 'likely', 'thought', 'would', 'never', 'have', 'do', 'such', 'launder', 'money', 'must', 'associate', 'many', 'unsavory', 'characters', 'have', 'evade', 'police', 'including', 'Walt', 'brother-in-law', 'DEA', 'agent', 'Hank', 'Schrader', 'Dean', 'Norris', '.The', 'series', 'tremendous', 'psychological', 'tension', 'Walt', 'suffers', 'attempting', 'live', 'double', 'life', 'keep', 'dealings', 'secret', 'wife', 'Skyler', 'Anna', 'Gunn', 'entire', 'season', 'final', 'episode', 'particular', 'extent', 'crimes', 'Walt', 'Jesse', 'affect', 'not', 'just', 'Walt', 'marriage', 'families', 'Walt', 'old', 'friendships', 'total', 'strangers', 'well.A', 'recurring', 'theme', 'really', 'viewer', 'sheer', 'number', 'lies', 'Walt', 'hide', 'drug', 'activities', 'season', 'progresses.This', 'series', 'not', 'children', 'are', 'extremely', 'harrowing', 'scenes', 'aftereffects', 'IED', 'explosion', 'fierce', 'gunfight', 'graphic', 'effects', 'drug', 'use', 'addiction', 'age', 'though', 'Breaking', 'Bad', 'extremely', 'rewarding', 'series', 'great', 'use', 'symbolism', 'show', 'unexpected', 'plot', 'twists', 'as', 'well', 'outstanding', 'scenes', 'New', 'Mexico', 'desert', 'moral', 'issues', 'negative', 'example', 'offering', 'lessons', 'how', 'not', 'deal', 'adversity', 'fear', 'uncertainty']",Breaking Bad: Season 2

1234123,A24WJULX7UOLFB,B001RTSPVY,"F. Jury ""dsunglasses""","[3, 4]","Breaking Bad is in my opinion the best serial scripted show on TV. I've certainly enjoyed some episodes more then others, but I've yet to see a bad episode.Season 2 picks up right where season one left off, and carries the show and its characters further down  the inevitable dark path they began in season one.In season one, Walt was a more likable character. He's a smart unassuming middle age family Man, who's grown tired of life screwing him over, and then gets a death sentence thrown in his lap. It was easier to understand and sympathize with his motivations, mainly wanting to be able to leave his family a nest egg once he is gone. Walt was a good man, being put in horrible situations, with no good answers.In season two, with twice the episodes, Walt and Jesse begin making some monetary progress, but also begin facing the consequences of the their bad actions and decisions. Murphy's law continues throughout the second season, and Walt begins to lose his innocence. Crazy Eight had warned him in season one to get out before it was too late. Walt's motivations are less pure, as pride, arrogance, greed and boredom, start to become his reasons for staying in the business. In the second to last episode of the season, Walt commits IMO his coldest act yet, with his passive and selfish indifference to Jane's death.Season 2 is well written and well acted, with numerous plot points that span the episodes.Despite the dark themes, realism and humor remain strong points of the show.My only criticism would be the plane crash scene, while well executed and certainly plausible, it just seemed a bit over the top to me, and out of line with a show so well grounded in its realism.Also, I'm a little disappointed that some great characters, are being dispatched so quickly. Crazy eight, Tuco and especially Jane, could have brought more to the show. In fact, I thought the Jesse/Jane combo was a good idea, and should have been played out much longer.Some interesting trivia for those who don't know, is that Jesse was originally supposed to die at the end of season one, but the writers strike, shortened the season and it never happened. Also, Hank and his partner were supposed to have something very bad happen to them at the end of season one as well, but again the strike intervened. Also in season two, in the scene with Jane's death, Jane was originally supposed to start choking right after Walt left, instead it was changed to allow Walt to witness it.I cannot comment on the DVD's, packing or extra's since they are not actually, released yet, but honestly who reads the reviews and decides to buy an entire season of something based on the extras and packaging?",5,Strong second season,1245369600,"06 19, 2009",2009,2683,"['Breaking', 'Bad', 'opinion', 'best', 'serial', 'scripted', 'show', 'TV', ""'ve"", 'certainly', 'enjoyed', 'episodes', 'more', 'then', 'others', ""'ve"", 'yet', 'see', 'bad', 'episode.Season', '2', 'up', 'right', 'where', 'season', 'one', 'left', 'off', 'show', 'characters', 'further', 'down', 'inevitable', 'dark', 'path', 'began', 'season', 'one.In', 'season', 'one', 'Walt', 'was', 'more', 'likable', 'character', 'smart', 'unassuming', 'middle', 'age', 'family', 'Man', 'who', 'grown', 'tired', 'life', 'screwing', 'then', 'death', 'sentence', 'thrown', 'lap', 'was', 'easier', 'understand', 'sympathize', 'motivations', 'mainly', 'wanting', 'be', 'able', 'leave', 'family', 'nest', 'egg', 'once', 'gone', 'Walt', 'was', 'good', 'man', 'being', 'put', 'horrible', 'situations', 'good', 'answers.In', 'season', 'two', 'twice', 'episodes', 'Walt', 'Jesse', 'begin', 'making', 'monetary', 'progress', 'also', 'begin', 'facing', 'consequences', 'bad', 'actions', 'decisions', 'Murphy', 'law', 'second', 'season', 'Walt', 'lose', 'innocence', 'Crazy', 'Eight', 'had', 'warned', 'season', 'one', 'get', 'out', 'was', 'too', 'late', 'Walt', 'motivations', 'are', 'less', 'pure', 'pride', 'arrogance', 'greed', 'boredom', 'start', 'become', 'reasons', 'staying', 'business', 'second', 'last', 'episode', 'season', 'Walt', 'IMO', 'coldest', 'act', 'yet', 'passive', 'selfish', 'indifference', 'Jane', 'death.Season', '2', 'well', 'written', 'well', 'acted', 'numerous', 'plot', 'points', 'span', 'episodes.Despite', 'dark', 'themes', 'realism', 'humor', 'remain', 'strong', 'points', 'show.My', 'only', 'criticism', 'would', 'be', 'plane', 'crash', 'scene', 'well', 'executed', 'certainly', 'plausible', 'just', 'seemed', 'bit', 'top', 'line', 'show', 'so', 'well', 'grounded', 'realism.Also', ""'m"", 'little', 'disappointed', 'great', 'characters', 'are', 'being', 'dispatched', 'so', 'quickly', 'Crazy', 'eight', 'Tuco', 'especially', 'Jane', 'could', 'have', 'brought', 'more', 'show', 'fact', 'thought', 'Jesse/Jane', 'combo', 'was', 'good', 'idea', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'played', 'out', 'much', 'longer.Some', 'interesting', 'trivia', 'who', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'Jesse', 'was', 'originally', 'supposed', 'die', 'end', 'season', 'one', 'writers', 'strike', 'shortened', 'season', 'never', 'happened', 'Also', 'Hank', 'partner', 'were', 'supposed', 'have', 'something', 'very', 'bad', 'happen', 'end', 'season', 'one', 'as', 'well', 'again', 'strike', 'intervened', 'Also', 'season', 'two', 'scene', 'Jane', 'death', 'Jane', 'was', 'originally', 'supposed', 'start', 'choking', 'right', 'Walt', 'left', 'instead', 'was', 'changed', 'allow', 'Walt', 'witness', 'it.I', 'can', 'not', 'comment', 'DVD', 'packing', 'extra', 'are', 'not', 'actually', 'released', 'yet', 'honestly', 'who', 'reviews', 'decides', 'buy', 'entire', 'season', 'something', 'based', 'extras', 'packaging']",Breaking Bad: Season 2

Meanwhile, Walter's DEA brother-in-law Hank (Dean Norris) continues his hunt for the supplier of blue meth, a man later revealed to go by the name of Heisenberg which, of course, is Walter White's name for his alter ego.In this season, the relationship between Walt and his immediate family degrades while that with Jesse oscillates all over the place, primarily due to Jesse's spiral into increased drug use.  Walt and Jesse's problems only magnify, however, when they are forced to bring in outside parties to help them with their business.Danny Trejo guest stars in a disturbing episode where Hank heads down to Juarez to assist a nearby DEA branch.  In addition, Bob Odenkirk (of ""The Ben Stiller Show"" fame) comes on as a new character, a ""criminal"" lawyer who helps Walt and Jesse with various problems.  A bearded John de Lancie (Q from ""Star Trek: The Next Generation"") appears in several episodes as the father of Jesse's new girlfriend.  He does a fabulous job of playing the girl's tortured, loving father.This is one of the best shows ever made for TV (and trust me, I've seen my fair share).

1234140,A1ZR8F86DJRVLX,B001RTSPVY,Jason Bean,"[2, 3]","The first season of 'Breaking Bad' was easily one of the most addicting shows on TV. The story of a high school teacher, 'Walt' who's diagnosed with a serious case of cancer and finds his calling in the drug-trade is hard to resist. This second season of 'Breaking Bad' is just as addictive with an even longer season (13 episodes) but sometimes takes a bit too much for granted.The story of 'Breaking Bad' season two picks up exactly where season one left off. Walt and his former student Jesse have gone into business with drug dealer Tuco and end up getting in way over their heads, even as their drug gives them a strong rep on the streets. Adding to this both Walt and Jesse's personal lives are becoming deeply effected, especially Walt's relationship with his wife and son. The one thing I love about this show is how nothing Walt and Jesse (and any of the other characters) do or scheme is without consequence and watching their plans 'almost' succeed or change in unpredictable ways is a pure delight. Unfortunately as well thought-out as the episode's plots are, the credibility is stretched pretty thin to service the plot: characters start behaving unbelievably, certain situations play out in ways that you KNOW isn't possible (even in the show's sense) and the plots follow a few too many red-herrings (which don't seem to have much point). The dark sense of humor is still intact, but the sinking likability of characters will no doubt test the dedication of some fans.Like the first season, this DVD set of Breaking Bad season 2 comes with some great extras. The usual behind the scenes features are there with some fun gag reels. The best addition is the hilarious ""webisodes"" which were originally only available (free) online.The same strengths of the first season of 'Breaking Bad' are here with stellar acting by the entire cast and some engagingly gritty scenes of violence and the drug-world. While I felt season 2 wasn't as satisfying as the first, this DVD set is still a must-buy and won't disappoint fans.",4,A leap in credibility.....,1301097600,"03 26, 2011",2011,2032,"['first', 'season', ""'Breaking"", 'Bad', 'was', 'easily', 'one', 'most', 'addicting', 'shows', 'TV', 'story', 'high', 'school', 'teacher', 'who', 'diagnosed', 'serious', 'case', 'cancer', 'calling', 'drug-trade', 'hard', 'resist', 'second', 'season', ""'Breaking"", 'Bad', 'just', 'addictive', 'even', 'longer', 'season', '13', 'episodes', 'sometimes', 'bit', 'too', 'much', 'granted.The', 'story', ""'Breaking"", 'Bad', 'season', 'two', 'up', 'exactly', 'where', 'season', 'one', 'left', 'off', 'Walt', 'former', 'student', 'Jesse', 'have', 'gone', 'business', 'drug', 'dealer', 'Tuco', 'end', 'up', 'getting', 'way', 'heads', 'even', 'drug', 'strong', 'rep', 'streets', 'Adding', 'Walt', 'Jesse', 'personal', 'lives', 'are', 'becoming', 'deeply', 'effected', 'especially', 'Walt', 'relationship', 'wife', 'son', 'one', 'thing', 'love', 'show', 'how', 'nothing', 'Walt', 'Jesse', 'other', 'characters', 'do', 'scheme', 'consequence', 'watching', 'plans', ""'almost"", 'succeed', 'change', 'unpredictable', 'ways', 'pure', 'delight', 'Unfortunately', 'well', 'episode', 'plots', 'are', 'credibility', 'stretched', 'pretty', 'thin', 'service', 'plot', 'characters', 'start', 'behaving', 'unbelievably', 'certain', 'situations', 'play', 'out', 'ways', 'KNOW', ""n't"", 'possible', 'even', 'show', 'sense', 'plots', 'follow', 'few', 'too', 'many', 'red-herrings', 'do', ""n't"", 'seem', 'have', 'much', 'point', 'dark', 'sense', 'humor', 'still', 'intact', 'sinking', 'likability', 'characters', 'will', 'doubt', 'test', 'dedication', 'first', 'season', 'DVD', 'set', 'Breaking', 'Bad', 'season', '2', 'great', 'extras', 'usual', 'scenes', 'features', 'are', 'there', 'fun', 'gag', 'reels', 'best', 'addition', 'hilarious', 'webisodes', 'were', 'originally', 'only', 'available', 'free', 'online.The', 'same', 'strengths', 'first', 'season', ""'Breaking"", 'Bad', 'are', 'here', 'stellar', 'acting', 'entire', 'cast', 'engagingly', 'gritty', 'scenes', 'violence', 'drug-world', 'felt', 'season', '2', 'was', ""n't"", 'as', 'satisfying', 'first', 'DVD', 'set', 'still', 'must-buy', 'wo', ""n't"", 'disappoint', 'fans']",Breaking Bad: Season 2

The dark humor is intact, as well as the intense action and drama that made Season 1 so groundbreaking.  The storyline is intriguing, but Bryan Cranston's acting makes this one of TV's best shows.  The man is captivating no matter what kind of scene he's doing.  We all know how well he can pull off humor from his work on Seinfeld and Malcolm in the Middle, but he can do anything and everything else required of Walter White's character.  Any emotion you can think of, he can find the perfect facial expression and voice to make the viewer feel exactly what his character is experiencing.  When you have an actor who can carry a show like Cranston does, you don't need to have one of the most compelling plots ever thought up for a series...but Breaking Bad has that, too!  The ripple-effect of consequences stemming from Walt's self-destructive decisions continues to spread wider in this 13-episode season, and Walt seeks deeper into the underworld of the drug game.  The show resonates because we all say we'd do whatever it would take to protect and provide for our family, but how far would we really go?  How many of us would stoop to crime if we thought it would leave our families financially secure for their entire lives?  Desperation can be a powerful motivator, and this show clearly makes that point.  With an incredibly strong supporting cast that's just barely a notch below Cranston himself, Breaking Bad has more to offer than just about anything on TV.",5,"Breaking Bad, Season 2",1384041600,"11 10, 2013",2013,1569,"['Season', '2', 'Breaking', 'Bad', 'incredible', 'premise', 'set', 'up', '7-episode', 'first', 'season', 'dark', 'humor', 'intact', 'as', 'well', 'intense', 'action', 'drama', 'made', 'Season', '1', 'so', 'groundbreaking', 'storyline', 'intriguing', 'Bryan', 'Cranston', 'acting', 'one', 'TV', 'best', 'shows', 'man', 'captivating', 'matter', 'what', 'kind', 'scene', 'doing', 'know', 'how', 'well', 'can', 'pull', 'off', 'humor', 'work', 'Seinfeld', 'Malcolm', 'Middle', 'can', 'do', 'anything', 'everything', 'else', 'required', 'Walter', 'White', 'character', 'emotion', 'can', 'think', 'can', 'find', 'perfect', 'facial', 'expression', 'voice', 'make', 'viewer', 'feel', 'exactly', 'what', 'character', 'experiencing', 'When', 'have', 'actor', 'who', 'can', 'carry', 'show', 'Cranston', 'do', ""n't"", 'need', 'have', 'one', 'most', 'compelling', 'plots', 'ever', 'thought', 'up', 'series', 'Breaking', 'Bad', 'too', 'ripple-effect', 'consequences', 'stemming', 'Walt', 'self-destructive', 'decisions', 'spread', 'wider', '13-episode', 'season', 'Walt', 'deeper', 'underworld', 'drug', 'game', 'show', 'say', ""'d"", 'do', 'whatever', 'would', 'take', 'protect', 'provide', 'family', 'how', 'far', 'would', 'really', 'go', 'How', 'many', 'would', 'stoop', 'crime', 'thought', 'would', 'leave', 'families', 'financially', 'secure', 'entire', 'lives', 'Desperation', 'can', 'be', 'powerful', 'motivator', 'show', 'clearly', 'point', 'incredibly', 'strong', 'supporting', 'cast', 'just', 'barely', 'notch', 'Cranston', 'Breaking', 'Bad', 'more', 'offer', 'just', 'anything', 'TV']",Breaking Bad: Season 2

If you could have one of the following wishes granted, which would you take? Money, Power or Respect. Walt White has none of these advantages but because he has knowledge, Walt is able to score all three. Walt missed his chance to fulfill his potential a long time ago because of stubbornness. Now he has a lifestyle that is very routine and unchallenging. His in-laws seem to remind him of his inadequacies often. As do his high school students who he fails to reach despite his passion for science versus life. When he finds out that he has lung cancer and has a chance encounter with a former student (that he has nothing in common with)... the stage is set to start earning extra money manufacturing drugs.I was wandering Borders with a 40% coupon and I happened upon Season One of Breaking Bad. I went to Amazon on my phone and discovered the following: About 60 reviews and most of them gave it all 5 stars. Outstanding. In one weekend I watched them all under ideal conditions: I had a cough that wouldn't die. I had empathy for Walter White. The funny thing is, I don't normally like movies about the drug trade. I don't like good people who crash and burn. When that person is reluctant and their decline is spread out over a long period of time, then it's like watching a train wreck in super slow mo. I believe it when it's a process, not a sharp 180 crammed into 46 minutes minus commercials. Also, the way Walt uses his science smarts to turn the tables on his enemies during confrontations makes for the best television I've seen in years. MacGyver insults your intelligence. Walt makes you feel smarter than James Freaking Bond.Season Two: The best thing I can say is that I jumped when someone rang a bell for service when I was in a little retail setting recently. After season two: the sound of the little desktop bell will make you VERY alert. I bought this set for the extras. I don't know that this show has what I call repeatability. Time will tell. I'm so wrapped up in Season 3 currently that I haven't watched anything twice yet.My favorite movies of all time involve reluctant heroes. Bryan Cranston masterfully plays a dorky high school science teacher who never found his real potential. An underachiever who turns to the dark side when he is faced with mortality. So often in life we take the path of least resistance when forced to partner up in business, romance or gym class. The partnership of Jesse and Walt could not be more volatile and watching their interaction is often hilarious.I'm in Season 3 and finally caught up. The karma resonates as Walt's greed compounds. More characters are introduced; each of them affected negatively by the new player in town. Drugs ruin lives and take down a lot of the people connected to the users, dealers and manufacturers. Walt finds himself close to the edge with increasing frequency and when he acts out, it's a pleasure to watch.",5,Why Bad is So Good,1271894400,"04 22, 2010",2010,2949,"['had', 'read', 'challenging', 'question', 'once', 'could', 'have', 'one', 'following', 'wishes', 'granted', 'would', 'take', 'Money', 'Power', 'Respect', 'Walt', 'White', 'none', 'advantages', 'knowledge', 'Walt', 'able', 'score', 'three', 'Walt', 'missed', 'chance', 'fulfill', 'potential', 'long', 'time', 'ago', 'stubbornness', 'Now', 'lifestyle', 'very', 'routine', 'unchallenging', 'in-laws', 'seem', 'remind', 'inadequacies', 'often', 'do', 'high', 'school', 'students', 'who', 'reach', 'passion', 'science', 'versus', 'life', 'When', 'out', 'lung', 'cancer', 'chance', 'encounter', 'former', 'student', 'nothing', 'common', 'stage', 'set', 'start', 'earning', 'extra', 'money', 'manufacturing', 'drugs.I', 'was', 'wandering', 'Borders', '40', '%', 'coupon', 'happened', 'Season', 'One', 'Breaking', 'Bad', 'went', 'Amazon', 'phone', 'discovered', 'following', '60', 'reviews', 'most', 'gave', '5', 'stars', 'Outstanding', 'one', 'weekend', 'watched', 'ideal', 'conditions', 'had', 'cough', 'would', ""n't"", 'die', 'had', 'empathy', 'Walter', 'White', 'funny', 'thing', 'do', ""n't"", 'normally', 'like', 'movies', 'drug', 'trade', 'do', ""n't"", 'like', 'good', 'people', 'who', 'crash', 'burn', 'When', 'person', 'reluctant', 'decline', 'spread', 'out', 'long', 'period', 'time', 'then', 'watching', 'train', 'wreck', 'super', 'slow', 'mo', 'believe', 'when', 'process', 'not', 'sharp', '180', 'crammed', '46', 'minutes', 'minus', 'commercials', 'Also', 'way', 'Walt', 'science', 'smarts', 'turn', 'tables', 'enemies', 'confrontations', 'best', 'television', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'years', 'MacGyver', 'insults', 'intelligence', 'Walt', 'feel', 'smarter', 'James', 'Freaking', 'Bond.Season', 'Two', 'best', 'thing', 'can', 'say', 'jumped', 'when', 'someone', 'rang', 'bell', 'service', 'when', 'was', 'little', 'retail', 'setting', 'recently', 'season', 'two', 'sound', 'little', 'desktop', 'bell', 'will', 'make', 'VERY', 'alert', 'bought', 'set', 'extras', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'show', 'what', 'call', 'repeatability', 'Time', 'will', 'tell', ""'m"", 'so', 'wrapped', 'up', 'Season', '3', 'currently', 'have', ""n't"", 'watched', 'anything', 'twice', 'yet.My', 'favorite', 'movies', 'time', 'involve', 'reluctant', 'heroes', 'Bryan', 'Cranston', 'masterfully', 'dorky', 'high', 'school', 'science', 'teacher', 'who', 'never', 'found', 'real', 'potential', 'underachiever', 'who', 'dark', 'side', 'when', 'faced', 'mortality', 'So', 'often', 'life', 'take', 'path', 'least', 'resistance', 'when', 'forced', 'partner', 'up', 'business', 'romance', 'gym', 'class', 'partnership', 'Jesse', 'Walt', 'could', 'not', 'be', 'more', 'volatile', 'watching', 'interaction', 'often', 'hilarious.I', ""'m"", 'Season', '3', 'finally', 'caught', 'up', 'karma', 'Walt', 'greed', 'More', 'characters', 'are', 'introduced', 'affected', 'negatively', 'new', 'player', 'town', 'Drugs', 'ruin', 'lives', 'take', 'down', 'lot', 'people', 'connected', 'users', 'dealers', 'manufacturers', 'Walt', 'close', 'edge', 'increasing', 'frequency', 'when', 'out', 'pleasure', 'watch']",Breaking Bad: Season 2

After the first couple of episodes I felt that I knew and understood the Cranston character and was facinated to watch the roller coaster ride his life had turned into for all the right reasons.  The stupidity of the protagonists never disappoints in surprising you with the smartness of the writers and the enjoyable slant of the producers.  The one bare breast in the first episode is not repeated during the first season so don't be put off by that nipple if you are prudish.  Breaking Bad is a smart, thrilling and fast pased roller coaster ride that makes poigniant observation of middle class life and generates genuine sympathy for the lead character that soon has you rooting for him.

The relationship between Jesse and Walt during this season is completely amazing, I have to say that Tuco is probably not the best foil in the world, but he still provides plenty of great moments for the show, culminating in the great hostage scene with the man with the bell.

Everything is quiet on the show including the sound, the people and the addictions.  The show is not held up by loud music but gentle sounds.  A kid shoots a drug dealer, a teddy bear is inexplicably immersed in water, two bodies are in body bags in a drive way, the images are compelling and the noise is soft.  Our protagonist is Walter White, a high school Chemistry teacher with a sterling reputation.  He has lung cancer which is terminal and gets into dealing meth to make money for his family after he is gone.  In this season, his wife is unexpectedly pregnant after years of infertility.  His son is in high school and Walt has mixed feelings about him because of his cerebral palsy.  Walt has been making money to get treatments for his cancer and appears to have taken a turn for the better.  Questions are being asked by his wife about the money and a possible 2nd cell phone which appears after Walt disappears in a fugue state and is found naked in a grocery store.  The story the series tells in season 2 is of a man who is getting more into drug dealing and making money from it while his original reason is fading and less important.

I still don't watch much TV, but I made an exception for this show since it's so good.In this second season we see Walt and Jesse learning to deal with the problems in selling and distributing the meth.The show succeeds to a great extent because it's premise is both so improbable and dramatic, as a nerdy high school chemistry teacher sets out to make the purest, high yield meth on the market when he finds out he has stage 3A lung cancer.

1234189,A2ZLROGIL2V7GV,B001RTSPVY,Michael Crane,"[8, 10]","It didn't take long for me to come to the conclusion that ""Breaking Bad"" is one of the best shows I've seen since HBO's ""The Wire,"" and that's no easy feat considering I came to this realization during the first season that was only 7 episodes long (due to the writer's strike).  Those 7 episodes were more than enough to get me hooked.  Well, I have finished the second season and I still hold that very same conclusion.  This season is longer, darker and even more devastating--while still containing all of the dark comedy/humor of Season 1.I'm not going to go into a long synopsis of the show or season.  There are a lot of surprises and secrets and I would never forgive myself for giving any of them away.  I will be brief about describing the season:  Walt and Jesse get deeper and deeper into the dark and unforgiving drug world that knows of no innocent victims, and every step of the way only gives way to more complications and dangerous predicaments.  While Walt has always participated in this new illegal enterprise with the only reason being that he wants his family to have something after he dies (especially with a new bouncing baby on the way), his moral compass is pushed further and further and he starts to realize that there is a part of him, as much as he doesn't want to admit it, that actually enjoys doing it.  With this season it is more difficult than ever to continue with the lies to keep his family out of the loop... not to mention, keeping them safe.  This season, it's all about chain reactions.  Every act can, and will, create a consequence.Once again, I found myself invested with the storylines and characters.  I don't think there is an episode where I didn't feel some kind of tension or fear for what could happen next.  A show like this is very hard to pull off and it would be impossible to do so if it wasn't for the terrific writing, directing and casting.  Bryan Cranston is a force to be reckoned with and although his character is growing darker and scarier layers, he is still very much human and you care about him even if he's doing terrible things.  He's not some emotionless or flat character who craves power, and that's what makes the transformation all the more terrifying and heartbreaking.  I also have to say that even though he was outstanding in the first season, Aaron Paul really shines more than ever as ""Pinkman"" in Season 2 and there is an episode called ""Peekaboo"" where he completely owns every frame.  It is one of his best performances ever and this is his best season.The Blu Ray editon of Season 2 looks and sounds fantastic.  There are TONS of extra features to play around with such as commentary, a number of behind-the-scenes featurettes, webisodes and much, much more.  You won't find this package to be lacking, that much is for sure.The second season of ""Breaking Bad"" once again shows us a show that doesn't cut corners or slack in any way.  Every episode is engaging, tense and masterful.  The show continues to be filled with drama, suspense and humor.  If you were a fan of the first season then chances are that you will love what lies ahead in Season 2.  Moving up in the drug world ain't easy, and Walt and Jesse are about to find that out the hard way.

If you like 'Rescue Me' and 'The Sopranos' you should love this show. It's one of the best written shows on TV with great characters, dialogue, drama with a nice touch of comedy.This season is twice as long as the first, so the stories are much more elaborate. I had read that Aaron Paul was first thought to be a side character in a couple of episodes, but because of the chemistry between the two stars, was written in as a main character. I'm glad they did, as he is every bit as good as Brian Cranston an adds another dimension to the show.This DVD release has all 13 episodes from season two and lots of nice extras including commentary, deleted scenes and much more.

1234208,AG0UP5II9OSP2,B001RTSPVY,"Paul A. Wunderlich ""Tread softly...""","[0, 0]","Character development at its best. At first  I was reluctant, not wanting even to watch episode one, season one, of this series. In spite of my reluctance, the name of the series kept on popping up in random conversations with my friends, and Netflix continued to suggest it based on my interests. I finally gave it a shot and was extremely satisfied with not only the quality of the acting, of the film (filmed in 35 mm film), but also on the strength of the story itself.Walter White, the protagonist of the series, is a high school, genius chemistry teacher who is diagnosed with Stage IIIA lung cancer. After being told that the cancer was inoperable, and sneaking a peek into his bank account, he realizes his financial situation isn't healthy at all, worse off when he is offered medical treatment costing hundreds of thousands of dollars. S***it truly hit the fan for Mr. White. With less than a year to solve his financial crisis and having to pay a bucket load of cash for his treatment, Walter White recurs to a less reputable business to ensure his family's financial situation before he lays down on his deathbed. His brother-in-law, a DEA agent, spoils hims by saying a meth-cook may make up to seven hundred grand in less than a couple of batches of methamphetamine. Being a chemistry genius, he has no problem in conjuring the most perfect, purest recipe for cooking meth. He wouldn't imagine hell would break loose while dealing with the maniacs in this dark business. He thought he would be staying within the confinement of his RV meth-lab and living his normal parallel life.At the beginning the purpose of the series was for Walter to justify the ""righteous"" act of providing for his family's future when it meant going to the dark-side of money-making by not selling, but actually making the drugs: cooking meth (a.k.a crystal meth, ice, clouds, crystal, glass, tik, catch my drift?). It felt wrong but somehow, the fact that he was desperately struggling to keep his family from falling into the brink made the illicit act seem righteous.Molecular visuals of METH.Did you know that meth has a medical use? It's used for ADHD, narcolepsy, and treatment-resistant depression.After many attempts to sell what was renown as the purest meth out there, ""the blue stuff"", Walter and Jesse (his partner, a former high school student who is known to be a mediocre meth-cook) found trench after trench, failing at their attempts to make money by selling their product, which albeit highly addictive, always seemed to fall into the wrong hands. Fail after epic-fail, they found themselves delving into the dark-world of selling drugs, not at all expecting it to be such a treacherous path. They then recur to an alternate source of selling their genius-formula by contacting a fearless and very well respected business man and drug lord, a strategy they would eventually regret.For me the series has been very enjoyable, with more than just a great story-line and more than just action-and-adventure psychological excitement. Character development was the biggest takeaway for me from this series: How a man in search of a path, once thought righteous and bittersweet, found that he, in the contrary of rejecting the darkest parts of himself as he deepened into the dark-side, embraced them--the bitter portions of darkness gone after a prolonged dose of positive reinforcement upon earning heaps of cash by selling batch after batch of meth. How the character devolves was supremely achieved by the actor, Brian Cranston, winning him the Prime Time Emmy Award for three consecutive years in 2008, 2009, and 2010.In parallel with Walter's charter development, I also admire Jesse Pinkman's (Aaron Paul) devolution into a darker creature, more menacing, less tolerant and much less merciful. If he started out as a meth-head, he slowly turned into an character of many layers, of half-patched hidden depths. After having suffered beatings, the death of his true-love, and warming up to the idea of shooting people in the face, Pinkman becomes a man to fear, a man who has seen too much and is willing to die even if it means to defend what little is left of the world he loves.At the beginning of each episode, I was a little bothered by knowing I would have to watch so many more episodes that were fifty minutes long each, but hell, the production and quality of each one is so good that once you start watching it, you're lured into its mind-gripping world; you can't just shake it off. You'll end up watching the whole series in a matter of weeks.Season 5 is said to bring us a total of 16 episodes, divided in two parts. The first part was debuted last year, and the second part will be premiered in August 2013. It will surely be a blast as Mr. White's, Jesse's, Skyler's and Hank's future is wagered by the odds.DISCUSSION:I've asked myself many times these two questions in the midst of each episode:Could a series like this one actually increase the production of the drug ""meth"" by amateurs in their own ""RV super lab""? Or could it, in the contrary, decrease the amateur production and consumption of the drug after seeing what effects it has on peoples' lives and the appalling consequences it could have to their families?",5,Breaking Bad *spoiler alert*,1373846400,"07 15, 2013",2013,5244,"['Character', 'development', 'best', 'first', 'was', 'reluctant', 'not', 'wanting', 'even', 'watch', 'episode', 'one',

1234211,A2WYPTUQ7F16IH,B001RTSPVY,"Pinkyrose ""Pinky""","[0, 1]","Breaking Bad is very interesting.The acting is superb.Yes, I am a fan of Breaking Bad, however, there are major flaws in the story that just have to be addressed. Here are a few:l. Walt Jr. is far too cooperative for a 16 year old boy. When asked to do chores, he always says, &#34;Sure, Mom!&#34; like he is soooo happy. Most 16 year olds are sassy, self-centered, sleep all day-up all night, talk back, spend 99% of time with friends, NEVER do housework, and more. His grades would tank, too, if his dad was as much trouble as Walt Senior.2. Jesse's teeth are too perfect. A heavy meth user's teeth ground away with the constant use and gums are red, bloody, soft. Other users on the show have bad teeth, but not Jesse. NOT believeable.3. There is hardly any mention of DNA. At all murder scenes in which Walt just walks away, his DNA would be everywhere. BOTH their DNA and fingerprints were all over Uncle Tio's house--case over.4. At Tio's when Tuko throws Jesse and Walt's phones into the back yard, police would have found them, found their fingerprints and case over.5. Jesse is not that attractive that super hot chicks would be after him. The actresses chosen to play his love interests are way too pretty for a guy who is a big loser. They are also too tall and too big for him. He seems overpowered by them.6. The theft of lab equipment would have been noticed. Other teachers would have complained that things were missing. Schools keep up with stuff better than that. Each teacher uses the equipment, so someone would have noticed. There is always a bitchy woman on the staff who keeps up with stuff right down to pencils and erasers.7. No one ever seems to be looking out a window to see murders and kidnappings. Just not realistic.8. Mike would have immediately killed Walt when Walt killed Gus. Mike would know he had to get to Walt before Walt got to him.9. Killing 9 in prisons? Come on!! Prisons have cameras everywhere. Someone would have seen something. NOT believeable.10. When Hank was driving by the laundry, he would have seen Walt's car. We cannot believe that a skilled detective would rely on one person to drive him by that place only one time. He would have driven by at all hours of the day and night.11. Walt would have spent his money all along for basic household needs. They were barely getting by, so he would have been buying groceries, new shoes for Walt, Jr., baby clothes, gas, etc. He would have always had a pocket full of cash, to make Skyler's life smoother. She would have liked that and he could have eased her along better.12. Why did Walt make a pass at the principal? Does not make sense for him logically. We are to believe he does all things out of logic. This would only harm him.13. We are told over and over how he does this for his family. All right-----we get it. You do not have to remind us....enough already.14. Jesse throwing money away would not happen. He would be doing his best to show that he is a winner to his parents. He would have been buying things for his parents, sending his mom flowers on all occasions, and spending the cash on the girlfriends for diamonds, clothes, etc.15. Jesse would not drive a beat up car. He would have a Lexus or Mercedes. All drug dealers drive the best cars in town. The local car dealers rely on them to spend their cash and everyone turns a blind eye.16. Someone with the DEA would be on Walt and Jesse's side. The money is just too much of a temptation. They could have paid off their own informant.17. Jesse and Walt's DNA would be in the UHaul Truck that did the magnet thing. The magnets would get traced back to the junk yard and case closed.18. All junk yards have to give account for cars that are smashed. Even though they got rid of the RV, there would be enough left for DNA, even fingerprints. Case closed at that point.19. Someone would notice that Walt was visiting Jesse in the hospital. Case closed.20. The mask found in the desert would have had fingerprints or DNA from Walt. Case closed. It did lead them back to the school. DEA would have put in cameras and found Walt stealing more property. Most schools have cameras inside anyway. Case closed.21. Once Walt gets all that money, women would be after him.22. There are not enough female characters in this show. Women are always around where money is being made. Walt would have been tempted with plenty of 15 to 20 year olds. Hot chicks can sniff out cash.23. Walt would have been using cough drops with all that coughing.24. There is a mouth wash that cancer doctors prescribe for lung patients because of the dry mouth and odors. Walt would constantly be using mouthwash and cough drops.25. NO one with lung disease can run up and down steps. He would be on oxygen therapy with the air tanks needed at all times. Uncle Tio has them and he is sitting. Walt would not be that active with real lung cancer. Lungs determine all movement of the body. He would not be able to move like he does. Even driving a car is difficult with lung cancer and chemo.26. Nothing is said about the raids on Gus's delivery trucks. Law enforcement would have been involved, this would lead to Gus; case over.27. Ted would not be all goo goo over a 40 year old pregnant woman. He would have a long line of 20 year olds in his bed.28. Once Skylar found problems with Ted's books, he would have fired her. Men do not like bad news.29. They can pay $800,000 for a car wash????? How is that money laundering????30. Walt would have been traveling to the Caymen islands or other sites that will launder money for him. He could afford to hire a private plane.31. Walt would have an alternate plan of escape. With 80 million he would have many options.32. He would have been sending the family on long vacations, as in Europe or Australia. People with new money travel. He would keep them out of town and out of his way and out of harm.33. Most people who live in the West do speak Spanish. A person with Walt's intelligence would pick it up easily.34. Walt would buy diamonds and expensive shoes for Skylar. Woman can be bought off. Logically, he would appeal to her ego. As Ron White says, &#34;Diamonds, that will shut her up.&#34;35. The baby does not seem to grow very fast. Most children will not fit into a bassinet at age 6 to 9 months. Is that a real baby? Looks fake. Why is it always wearing a hat? In New Mexicto with heat in the 100's to 110's?36. Skylar would have followed Walt to the laundry. case closed.37. Friends of Crazy 8 would have gone to see Jesse as he was last seen with him.38. The police are portrayed as bunbling fools. Not so. They are generally very thorough. Not believeable that no police officer can put two and two together.39. There would have been a police report filed when Walt crashed the new car he bought for Walt Jr. Noone gets away with that kind of damage without someone noticing. cash closed40. Hank has plenty of chances to bug Walt's home or car. He would have just to find out the truth, then, he could have built his case.41. Gus's operation was way to big for him to rely on one person to cook. He would have had cooks all over the place. He could have set up labs in his trucks. He was too smart to put all his eggs in one basket.42. Tio would not pee in a pool in front of the Don--never happen. pee on flowers or people, but not the pool where gals are gonna be swimming.43. Walt Jr. never changes. A kid at age 16 changes in many ways. His hair style is not modern. His clothes are like circa 1995.44. Jesse's shirts never get dirty. The white stays the whitest. He sleeps in clothes, but they do not wrinkle and he does not smell. Not believeable.45. Hospitals film all visitors. Hank would have reviewed the tapes to see who was visiting Jesse. case closed46. All in all, too many things just are not believeable. Police are not that bad at their jobs and criminals are not that lucky.",5,I came late to this series; watched all 5 l/2 seasons in one week,1379548800,"09 19, 2013",2013,7890,"['Breaking', 'Bad',

1234215,A39IY0JU5JI69G,B001RTSPVY,"Promise ""promise""","[1, 4]","I fell in love with this series in Season One.  The first few episodes particularly were very smart and quite hilarious.  I totally bought the outrageous premise that a mild-mannered Walter Mitty type would morph into an aggressive drug dealer.  The actors were all good and I enjoyed the different personalities.  As far-out as the idea was, the script was so well written and acted that it seemed actually plausible as well as being highly entertaining.In Season Two, Walt had already grown into his new greedy self and there's not as much fun in watching it. I missed the humor and wit.  But it's interesting, from a psychological perspective to watch Walt coming into his power.  Apparently this is a man with some kind of Bad Mom who has married a woman who perpetuates the problem. Early on in the first season we see Skyler feeding Walt some sort of limp strips of vegetarian bacon. Ha. He eats it, uncomplainingly of course, just as he eats her repeated disrespect and that of his teen aged son who looks to the hyper-macho uncle as a role model.  Jesse got Skyler's number the first time he met her when he later referred to her as a ""nutcracker.""  Poor Walt doesn't quite get that yet and he caves in to her time and time again.  The episode with the ""talking pillow"" was amazing!By Season Two, Walt has descended into the underworld to reclaim some of his lost power. (Shades of Dante and Carl Jung!)  But he's still a little wobbly in his use of power.  He still caves into his wife but explodes sometimes abusively, at Jesse.  It isn't a lot of fun to watch but it is psychologically credible.  The relationship with Jesse is the best part of the show in my opinion.  I love seeing them progress from incessant bickering to something much, much better.Jesse's romance with Jane, the Girl-Next-Door was a welcome change from the darkness of the drug dealers and the inanity of Skyler.  The Sklyer character is interesting in that she is so bloody annoying yet she is presented as Mrs. Perfect Wife.  No wonder the man got cancer!  He should have consulted a psychiatrist as well as an oncologist but that wouldn't have made such a good story.  This is no fault of the actress; she plays it perfectly and she looks just right.  I live near Albuquerque and I could see Skyler in any of the local malls. She just made me want to scream, that's all.So was a relief, even visually to see  Jesse fall in love with Jane, the Girl-Next-Door, 21st Century, Albuquerque version. This Jane wears all black, talks tough and works in a tatoo shop in Nob Hill. (You can see Janes all over Nob Hill, in black boots, smoking cigarettes and, for some reason I've never understood they favor wearing straight black bangs.)  I liked the whole sequence with Jane and her Dad, the air traffic controller.  It brought back the elements of love and tenderness that the show needed to balance the violence. There's a great scene in a bar where the two dads who've met by chance talk about their daughters.  It's beautifully written and it ties in wonderfully with the following sequences where we see, literally, the ""fall-out"" of the incident with Jane.I fell in love with Jesse Pinkman, early on in Season One and he continued to hold my heart through Season Two.  Not to push the symbolism too far, but I  see him, the pink-man, as representing a true tender heart while Walter White is all bound up in being Mr. White. The poor guy gets beat up over and over but he manages to keep his heart open.  He took the rap for the joint, saving his younger brother, and he went out of his way to help the poor red-headed child of the wasted druggies.  Over and over he takes the heat from Walt, who is still caught in rigid Mr. White self-righteousness.  Until finally even Walt's heart melts at Jesse's problems and instead of yelling at him, he helps him.Actually the more I've ruminated about Season Two the more I've decided that it contains some great moments and Ive revised my intial three star score to four.

Look at the actors, they -know- it's dreck they are phoning in. Tell me you can't see it in almost every scene.Completely extraneous subplots are introduced (Skyler's work flirtation, ill-fated romance between Jesse and ""OD waiting to happen"" girl) that add -nothing- to the basic premises developed so well in Season 1 other than perhaps to appeal to the teenaged female vampire melodrama set. In fact, the gripping, absurdly believable ""dying chemistry teacher meth cook"" premise is all but back-burnered while we get to watch ""touching"" scenes of Sonograms, young flirtation and love, endless cancer conferences (yay! feelgood moment!), and endlessly verbose hyper-dialogue drama moments one can almost hear an ""awww!"" ""booo!"" or ""tada!"" after.To add insult to injury whoever wrote this mess decided that a highly coincidental plane crash needed to be added in as opposed to developing the very solid core concepts Season 1 was laden with. They could have put this show on auto-pilot by continuing awesome themes from Season 1 (boorishness of the bro in law, kleptomania of the sis in law, interaction with students in class v meth cook, ballsy use of dark side MacGuyver type tech to screw a-holes over... all interesting and smart, all tossed away inexplicably in favor of pure formulaic dreck).Instead they neutered a masterpiece and drained every loving ounce of testosterone out of the show. Don't be fooled by viral marketing shills posting ""objective"" reviews here, three stars is a stretch for this tedious snooze, I gave it two because it is so very obvious that many of the fives are shall we say ""bought and sold.""",2,"Put Down the Pipe, Season Two of Breaking Bad BLOWS!",1274400000,"05 21, 2010",2010,1953,"['dunno', 'what', 'show', 'people', 'are', 'reviewing', 'obviously', 'Season', '1', 'brilliant', 'masterpiece', 'not', 'Season', '2', 'tepid', 'cliche', 'Breaking', 'Bad', 'character', 'development', 'dark', 'humor', 'nail-biting', 'suspense', 'ingenious', 'plot', 'devices', 'gone', 'replaced', 'endless', 'segue', 'soap', 'drama', 'moment', 'soap', 'drama', 'moment', 'Look', 'actors', '-know-', 'dreck', 'are', 'phoning', 'Tell', 'ca', ""n't"", 'see', 'almost', 'scene.Completely', 'extraneous', 'subplots', 'are', 'introduced', 'Skyler', 'work', 'flirtation', 'ill-fated', 'romance', 'Jesse', 'OD', 'waiting', 'happen', 'girl', 'add', 'basic', 'premises', 'developed', 'so', 'well', 'Season', '1', 'other', 'perhaps', 'appeal', 'teenaged', 'female', 'vampire', 'melodrama', 'set', 'fact', 'gripping', 'absurdly', 'believable', 'dying', 'chemistry', 'teacher', 'meth', 'cook', 'premise', 'back-burnered', 'get', 'watch', 'touching', 'scenes', 'Sonograms', 'young', 'flirtation', 'love', 'endless', 'cancer', 'conferences', 'yay', 'feelgood', 'moment', 'endlessly', 'verbose', 'hyper-dialogue', 'drama', 'moments', 'one', 'can', 'almost', 'hear', 'awww', 'booo', 'tada', 'add', 'insult', 'injury', 'whoever', 'wrote', 'mess', 'decided', 'highly', 'coincidental', 'plane', 'crash', 'needed', 'be', 'added', 'as', 'opposed', 'developing', 'very', 'solid', 'core', 'concepts', 'Season', '1', 'was', 'laden', 'could', 'have', 'put', 'show', 'auto-pilot', 'continuing', 'awesome', 'themes', 'Season', '1', 'boorishness', 'bro', 'law', 'kleptomania', 'sis', 'law', 'interaction', 'students', 'class', 'v', 'meth', 'cook', 'ballsy', 'use', 'dark', 'side', 'MacGuyver', 'type', 'tech', 'screw', 'a-holes', 'interesting', 'smart', 'tossed', 'away', 'inexplicably', 'favor', 'pure', 'formulaic', 'dreck', '.Instead', 'neutered', 'masterpiece', 'drained', 'loving', 'ounce', 'testosterone', 'show', 'Do', ""n't"", 'be', 'fooled', 'viral', 'marketing', 'shills', 'posting', 'objective', 'reviews', 'here', 'three', 'stars', 'stretch', 'tedious', 'snooze', 'gave', 'two', 'so', 'very', 'obvious', 'many', 'fives', 'are', 'shall', 'say', 'bought', 'sold']",Breaking Bad: Season 2
1234221,A1F93NA8HQ47IU,B001RTSPVY,"Reconnecting To My Childhood ""Time Won't Let ...","[10, 13]","I'm glad they are finally giving this amazingly filmed show a Blu-Ray release for it's second season and they are going back to release the first season on Blu-Ray as well. The second season of this AMC series starts right where the first dramatic season left off. From there it winds down a dark path where you can't see what's coming while still managing to up the stakes and get you more involved with the characters with each passing episode. While I wasn't quite prepared for where this season ended I have high hopes for the third season that will premiere this winter and highly recommend the first and second seasons to fans of well made television and certainly for fans of this series to rewatch it and notice things they've missed in first viewing. This 3-disc Blu-Ray set will contain the following episodes from season 2 of Breaking Bad (No Spoiler's):Seven Thirty-SevenWalt and Jesse try to end their deal with Tuco. Meanwhile, Hank attempts to repair Marie and Skyler's relationship.GrilledWith Walt and Jesse trapped with Tuco, Marie and Hank comfort Skyler over his disappearance.Bit by a Dead BeeWalt and Jesse's become short on cash when they try to cover their tracks. Meanwhile, the DEA has a lead that could get them straight to Walt and Jesse.DownWalt attempts to reconnect with his family, while Jesse struggles to rebuild his life.BreakageHank suffers from the aftermath of his encounter with Tuco. Meanwhile, Jesse hires a crew to get their product out on the streets.PeekabooWalt's secret is in jeopardy when Skyler thanks Gretchen for paying for his treatment. Jesse tries to please Walt by 'manning up' and getting back some money that was lifted from one of their new crew, but he runs into complications.Negro Y AzulRumors fly about Jesse's recent actions as he and Walt discuss expanding their business into new territories. Hank struggles to fit in with his new co-workers in El Paso. Skyler pursues a new job opportunity that reconnects her with a former colleague. Jesse gets to know his landlord, JaneBetter Call SaulWhen Badger finds himself in trouble with the law, Walt and Jesse seek the legal advice of a shady attorney, Saul Goodman. The DEA believe they may have finally caught up with the elusive 'Heisenberg.' Hank returns to Albuquerque, but his troubled mental state and demeanor cause Marie to worry.4 Days OutWalt interrupts Jesse's weekend plans to inform his partner they'll have to cook for four days straight, or risk losing their batch of methylamine. Out in the desert things get heated between them when they wind up stranded.OverWith Walt's disease in remission, the Whites throw a party for all those who've supported him through the ordeal, but the mood is ruined when Walt and Hank argue. Skyler is worried about Walt's emotional state as Walt tries various home improvement projects to occupy himself. Jane continues her relationship with Jesse but keeps this secret from her father.MandalaSaul suggests a new business partner for Walt. Skyler discovers something shocking at work. Jesse tells Jane about his 'job'. When an unreliable Jesse isn't there at a crucial moment, Walt must choose between an important moment in his familie's life or possibly scoring a big deal.PhoenixSkyler deals with newly developed family dynamic. Walter Jr. launches a new website to raise money for the family. Jane convinces Jesse to stand up to Walt. Walt makes a decision, or lack thereof, that sends him further down a path of darkness.ABQSkyler's frustration with Walt's secrecy boils over; Jesse heads further down a path of self-destruction, and only Walt is willing to help him; and a grief-stricken Donald experiences more tragedy. Walt's recent poor decisions have a much larger negative affect on others than he could ever have anticipated.'Seven Thirty-Seven' is an amazing season opener that leaves one anxiously awaiting the rest of the season. 'Grilled' provides a level of tension and excitement so high it leaves one wondering how the rest of the season will follow. While it does level out excitement-wise from there each episode is amazingly well crafted and dramatic from beginning to end. Other stand out episodes for me this season were '4 Days Out' and 'Mandala'. ABQ is also an incredibly well done season finale that leaves things in total chaos and wide open for the third season. Truly though, every episode stands out as excellently entertaining television making.Special Features Announced For This Blu-Ray Release Include:The Writer's Lab- An Interactive Guide to the Elements of an Episode. (Blu-Ray Exclusive)Cast and Crew Commentaries (The First Season Commentaries were very informative and entertaining)Inside Breaking Bad- 13 Featurettes About the Making of Each Episode.11 Behind The Scenes Featurettes6 Breaking Bad Original WebisodesWalt's Warning FeaturetteAs Well AsCop Talk With Dean Norris, Deleted Scenes, Gag Reel, ""Negro Y Azul"" Music Video, ""Better Call Saul"" Commercial, Vince Gilligan's Photo Gallery, a Season 1 Recap and a Season 3 Sneak Peak.This set is well worth the money with the amount of in depth bonus features you are getting along with the full season of 13 episodes as opposed to the first season set, which on account of the writer's strike, only had seven. These episodes are truly great televsion making and will certainly look great in High Definition.

1234227,A16QODENBJVUI1,B001RTSPVY,Robert Moore,"[17, 24]","Warning!  Many, many spoilers below!  Do NOT read this review of you do not want to be spoiled!  If all you want to know is whether this is a great show that is worth your time, yes, it most assuredly is.  Get it.  Watch it.  Look out for spoilers from here on out.Season One of BREAKING BAD was interrupted unhappily by the writers' strike.  It was one of the very few shows that stopped production to come back strong afterwards (well, PUSHING DAISIES came back strong creatively, but its viewership dropped somewhat and ABC, panicking with the downturn in the economy, unwisely pulled the plug on its best series).  One of the reasons that BREAKING BAD was able to come back and even build a bit of buzz over Season One was the well-deserved Emmy that Bryan Cranston won as Best Actor in a Drama.  Anyone who had seen him in MALCOLM IN THE MIDDLE knew that he was an extremely gifted comic actor, but seeing him perform so magnificently in a drama was almost like watching Jerry Seinfeld morph into Laurence Olivier.  Even the few episodes of Season One were enough to prove to anyone that Cranston was not merely a great comic actor, but one of the best actors around, regardless of genre.Season Two picked up where Season One left off and took Walter White and Jesse's story much further than had been possible in the debut season.  I am not quite certain where they had intended to end Season One.  I'm pretty certain that it would not have ended with Walter and Jesse making an arrangement with the gang lord Tuco to sell drugs to him.  No doubt they were forced to compact the story somewhat in Season Two to make up for the lost episodes.  The new season sees several general arcs develop.  Walter and Jesse's relationship to Tuco comes to an end and they are forced first to go into the business of selling themselves.  Later they make a new arrangement to sell their product to a major outside distributor.  Walter and Skyler's relationship comes under more and more strain as Walter strives to keep his life as a drug manufacturer hidden from her.  One of the most interesting parts of the show is the relationship between Walter and Jesse.  Although Walter despises and looks down upon Jesse, he also takes more and more the attitude of a parent towards an unruly child.  Even when he becomes a liability to Walter, he refuses to break his partnership with him.  But Walter becomes more and more hardened as the season goes along, becoming as ruthless as any of the drug lords he and Jesse encounter.Some of his decisions are so extreme that by the end of the season Walter actually starts to become a less than sympathetic character.  In fact, as much as I love this show -- and it is definitely among my very favorites alongside such shows as DOLLHOUSE, FRIDAY NIGHT LIGHTS, and MAD MEN -- I'm starting to wonder if Walter's growing hardening as a person will make him too unsympathetic a character for the show to stay as good as it has been.  Although other series like THE SHIELD have pushed the limits of how far one can go with the moral degradation of a lead character, there is a limit to just how far one can go.  By the end of Season Two one hardly empathizes with Walter as his life gradually begins to unravel.  And Jesse remains so pathetic that it is hard to care for him as much as we ought.  I'm far from the only person feeling this and hopefully in the off season the writers will listen to the fans and do something to make us care what happens to Walter, to make us want this to turn out OK for him.As great as this series is, there was one other thing in Season Two, besides Walter's growing unlikeability, that was a cause of disappointment, and that was the season finale.  Beginning with the first one, several episodes began with confusing and disturbing images of some cataclysmic event.  The natural expectation was that this was all leading up to some huge event at the end of the season.  Only . . . it didn't.  There was an event, but it was completely unconnected to anything involving Walter or Jesse.  I was simply aghast when the finale ended with nothing like the kind of resolution that the entire season seemed to be leading up to.There was a happy coincidence to end the season.  The finale was entitled ""ABQ.""  Initially I misread the title. I thought it was ""ABC.""  The reason this is interesting is that John de Lancie guest starred as the father of Jane, Jesse's girlfriend (played by the adorable Krysten Ritter -- when is she going to get a permanent gig on a series?  I've loved her on other shows like VERONICA MARS and THE GILMORE GIRLS and would love to see her in a major role on some series).  I have always loved John de Lancie and like Krysten Ritter, would like to see him far more often.  He is best known, of course, for his recurring role on the various STAR TREK spin offs, as the omnipotent, omniscient Q.  The happy coincidence is that many of his appearances on the STAR TREK episodes had titles that referred to his character, such as ""Q2"" or ""True Q"" or ""Qpid"" or ""The Q and the Grey.""  ""ABQ"" isn't too unlike one of those titles.  I don't think it was intended as homage to Q, but it was serendipitous.All in all, despite the increasing unlikeability of Walter and the disappointing finale, this was a great season.  There were many great episodes and a host of unforgettable moments.  The shot of a decapitated head slowly moving across the desert atop the back of a turtle is shocking in its horror.  Equally marvelous is a near quadriplegic who can only communicate by ringing a tiny bell attached to his chair.  Or a car that is bucking and jumping in place without a driver.  Or a drug addled hag crushing her lover's skull by lowering an ATM machine on it.  And when you get in trouble, you know what you need to do:  You'd better get Saul!I have a lot of faith in Vince Gilligan and his team of writers.  I think they will deal with the problem of Walter becoming too unlikeable.  And I think they will continue to come up with new and ever more fascinating story lines.  I'm excited about seeing what happens in Season Three.",5,The first full season is a good one,1243900800,"06 2, 2009",2009,6110,"['Warning', 'Many', 'many', 'spoilers', 'Do', 'NOT', 'read', 'review',

1234228,A18TLRH5PKAS4S,B001RTSPVY,Rodney Bucket,"[2, 2]","""Breaking Bad"" is a hell of a show. It follows the story of Walter White, a high school chemistry teacher in New Mexico with terminal lung cancer who decides to use his chemistry prowess to enter the world of crystal meth in an attempt to make as much money for his family as he can before he dies. Sound insane? You bet. But somehow it works.The second season of a television show is often thought to be the one that makes it or breaks it. In the case of ""Breaking Bad,"" its short first season was excellent, and suggested promise for its outlandish premise, but the second season would be the test of whether the show could really sustain itself. And it passed that test with flying colors.The second season exceeds the first in every way. The stakes are higher, the premises crazier, and the danger greater than ever. The series still hinges upon Bryan Cranston's pitch-perfect performance as Walter, a wonderfully complex tragic hero whose downfall seems inevitable but for whom you can't help but root nevertheless. Season two finds Walter getting deeper and deeper into the dark world of drugs, and the show takes several dark turns as Walter does things we never imagined him capable of.This show is one of the best and most innovative ones on television, and hopefully it will continue for some time to come (although, as is always the case with television shows, may it end on a good note before it goes stale). Season three is set to start next month, and it would be a mistake to miss it -- but it would also be a mistake to watch it without having seen the first two seasons, so if you haven't yet entered the dark and whacky world of ""Breaking Bad,"" what are you waiting for?

From there we're taken on a whirlwind tour of 13 of the best episodic drama series ever written.Haunting black and white images of a burned purple teddy appear throughout the series, teasing the viewer at a tantalising finale. Walt's cancer gets worse prompting him to do more desperate things to get money quicker for his family, while Jesse falls in love with a recovering drug addict.As Walt and Jesse's operation grows they recruit more of Jesse's druggie friends and we meet a charismatic but crooked lawyer who helps the duo launder their ill-gotten gains. Skyler begins suspecting what her husband is up to during all this time while getting closer to term with her pregnancy, and all the while Walt's brother in law Hank the DEA agent is getting closer to discovering who is producing this new high quality blue meth...Incredibly, Season 2 is better than Season 1 and is twice as long so the characters are given more room to become interesting and develop, the storylines get fleshed out, and the studio has given the crew more money so everything is done on a larger scale.I loved the new additions to the cast - Jesse's friends, his love interest and her father (played by the brilliant John De Lancie) and the crooked lawyer played by Bob Odenkirk was a wonderful highlight as well.There are so many exceptional scenes it's impossible to list them here. The writing is as amazing as always, the acting is as strong as ever and the entire series is a joy to watch from start to finish.

1234233,A2PNTEDGMOLMOY,B001RTSPVY,Scott Schiefelbein,"[0, 0]","Bryan Cranston continues to revel in his second ""role of a lifetime"" - the first being Hal in the comic gem ""Malcolm in the Middle,"" and now as America's favorite beleaguered chemistry teacher, Walt White.  ""Breaking Bad - Season 2"" continues creator Vince Gilligan's magnificant exploration of how modern man fights back against fate.A grim sense of foreboding stalks the second season of AMC's surprise hit show.  Each of the thirteen episodes starts with a brief prologue - often without any dialogue - that hints at the trials to come.  By far the creepiest of these scenes are the repeated shots of a jarringly pink teddy bear (the only part of these scenes shot in color - the rest of shots are in black-and-white) with one eye ripped from its socket floating in what looks like Walt's swimming pool, only to be swept up by a criminal investigatory team.  We have no idea whose teddy bear it is or how it got there - but it's clear that this can't be good news for Walt.In many ways, Season 2 shows how Walt keeps jumping from the frying pan to safety, only to realize that he's landed on another frying pan.  He's still sick with cancer, and now he's coughing blood.  His product is still the best on the market, but the dealer connection he forged at the end of Season One is fraught with danger - Tuco is more than a bit unstable.  His sidekick Jesse continues to skirt just on the responsible side of ruin.  And his wife Skylar is getting both more pregnant and suspicious every day.Can Walt stay healthy long enough to build a nest egg for his family?  Can he escape the casual, senseless death that takes so many drug dealers?  Can he continue to fly under the radar of his DEA-agent brother-in-law, who is unwittingly hunting for Walt in the guise of Heisenberg?

1234247,A185QFJRTB5W93,B001RTSPVY,"TrailsEndWild ""Writer/Researcher""","[9, 12]","Okay, I am going to go against the grain of other reviewers here and (without spoilers) give you the true scoop on Season 2.  As we all recall, Season 1 was more than riveting, it was groundbreaking storytelling at its finest.  Season 2 starts off this way and then takes a sharp decline.  It is almost as if the first three episodes and the last three episodes of Season 2 were written by someone else.  The middle episodes (while still better than most other schlock on television) seemed to drag on forever.  I cannot help it, I find Walt's wife to be the least likable, least interesting, and the character I would most love to see killed off in the entire series (with Hank a close second, but he gets better developed in Season 3).  Season 2 spends a lot of time focusing on Skyler, her pregnancy and Walt's medical condition.  Yeah, I am aware that these are central to the series, but enough already, we get it, can we move on to the more interesting aspects of this series?  Maybe it was just me, but I found the finale to be less than climactic and could see it coming from the second to last episode.  Maybe I am just jaded by how great Season 1 was and Season 3 is (which I am watching now - hint: Much more like Season 1 - AMAZING).  Again, I am not bashing this show, I find the entire series to be superior to most all others I have watched, however once you set such a high standard, it is imperative to live up to it with each episode and not throw fillers in mid-season just to drag the story out longer.  Tell your story clearly and concisely.  No, this is not a short-attention span thing, it is a classic storytelling rule that should be adhered to.  Admittedly, I watched the entire season in about 3 days, so maybe I was just overwhelmed by everything that was going on, but you would think that (given that short span of time) I would not have felt that the show was moving along too slow. Now, the haters can hate and bash this review, but if you are a true fan of this series, you must admit that I am right on at least a few points.  And for those comparing this series to THE SHIELD...come on!!!  THE SHIELD jumped the shark the minute they killed Lem.  The rest of that show was a jumbled mess.  THE SHIELD does not even deserve to stand in Breaking Bad's shadow.  Final thought: Breaking Bad is still one of the finest series ever.

I also pondered whether or not that kind of magic can be duplicated, and feared season 2 would have to be a letdown after a blockbuster first season.I was so wrong. Season 2 blew season 1 out of the water. It was better in so many ways. Aaron Paul deserved the Emmy nomination because he was fantastic, Cranston once again was light years better than any performance you will see on tv. The editing, cinematography, music cues, scene location, and direction were just so perfectly blended. Everything about season 2 was great.But it starts with the story, of course. And naturally youre left, after season 1's finale, wondering what direction the show is going to careen off into and carry a mesmerized audience. The conclusion of season 1 left us with a pretty good idea of what was going to happen, and then season 2 went break-neck speed further past that and well beyond. I was stunned at how beautiful and tragic some of the character developments evolved, such as the scene where Jesse's girlfriend dies, the scene just prior to where Walt is at the bar with (unknowingly) the girls father, and then the action Walt takes to save Jesse from his despair. Its madness and yet its so touching. Definitely one of my favorite sequences.Or the scene where Tuco has Jesse at gunpoint and Jesse mans up and truly breaks bad by actually overpowering the lunatic Tuco. Real solid character development that had me howling for Jesse's triumph.You can have your reality tv, your lame game shows, your crime dramas  your adult swim whatever. Nothing, and I mean NOTHING compares to this masterpiece. There has never been a show so engaging, thrilling and groundbreaking as this show, and you will never see a show like this as long as you live.

It would be unbearable if not for the excellent cast, led by the superb Bryan Cranston, the unpredictable plots, and the great dialogue.  The situation remains dire:  Walt still has cancer, coughs a lot--sometimes blood, still cooks the best dope in all of Albuquerque with his goofy partner/distributor, and is getting caught up in the world of drug sales and criminals.  In the meantime, his brother in law, a DEA agent, is brewing beer in his garage when not investigating drug-related crimes.  And Walt's wife and son still have no clue about what he is doing, although he remains a mystery because he's so often gone from the house for long stretches of time.

A new drug boss Gus Fring (Giancarlo Esposito who deserves an Emmy for his performance) is introduced while Skylar (Anna Gunn) ends up returning to work for her former boss Ted (Christopher Cousins)with unexpected consequences.The second season of ""Breaking Bad"" was where the show truly found itself (the first season is exceptional as well)setting up events that will play out over the next two seasons. As the seasons have progressed we've seen Walt become darker what's amazing is how Bryan Cranston has managed to continue to make Walt both sympathetic and destestable at the same time. It's a difficult trick for any actor to pull of (hence his Emmy awards much deserved for his performances throughout the series)but Cranston wouldn't be able to keep the show afloat by himself; he has terrific support from ALL the members of the cast and there isn't a weak link among them.The second season looks even better than the first--with a pretty strong presentation the New Mexico blue skies positively pop, blacks are pretty strong and detail is exceptionally good.Audio sounds marvelous with an impressive lossless presentation. Dialog is pefectly clear throughout and subtitles in English and French (strangely no Spanish)and SDH English.Special features are scattered over all three discs with the majority on disc three. We get four audio commentaries featuring Cranston, Gunn, RJ Mitte and others as well as members of the creative team (writer-producer-creator Vince Gilligan). We also get deleted scenes. There's also a music video for the song ""Negro Y Azul"" which is odd considering that it opens the episode of the same name.We also get the full ""Better Call Saul"" commericial, gag reel, ""Cop Talk with Dean Norris"" interviewing their police consultants. We also get six webisodes. ONce again we get ""Vince Gilligan's Photo Gallery"" as well as some assorted short featurettes.The second season of ""Breaking Bad"" builds on the excellent first season with richer, deeper performances and creator Gilligan is able to expand on the storyline introduced during the shorter season one building credible, fascinating characters and putting together a fascinating twisted modern morality play where Walt continually chooses the wrong path.",5,"A fascinating, richer second season for ""Breaking Bad"" expands on the themes of the first season-Blu-ray review",1345334400,"08 19, 2012",2012,2517,"['Walt', 'Emmy', 'winner', 'Bryan', 'Cranston', 'further', 'evil', 'losing', 'Heisenberg', 'drug', 'manufacturing', 'alter', 'ego', 'Jessie', 'Emmy', 'winner', 'Aaron', 'Paul', 'fill', 'void', 'left', 'death', 'drug', 'lord', 'Tuco', 'Raymond', 'Cruz', 'Closer', 'Complete', 'Seventh', 'Season', 'new', 'drug', 'boss', 'Gus', 'Fring', 'Giancarlo', 'Esposito', 'who', 'Emmy', 'performance', 'introduced', 'Skylar', 'Anna', 'Gunn', 'up', 'returning', 'work', 'former', 'boss', 'Ted', 'Christopher', 'Cousins', 'unexpected', 'consequences.The', 'second', 'season', 'Breaking', 'Bad', 'was', 'where', 'show', 'truly', 'found', 'first', 'season', 'exceptional', 'well', 'setting', 'up', 'events', 'will', 'play', 'out', 'next', 'two', 'seasons', 'seasons', 'have', 'progressed', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'Walt', 'become', 'darker', 'what', 'amazing', 'how', 'Bryan', 'Cranston', 'managed', 'continue', 'make', 'Walt', 'sympathetic', 'destestable', 'same', 'time', 'difficult', 'trick', 'actor', 'pull', 'hence', 'Emmy', 'awards', 'much', 'deserved', 'performances', 'series', 'Cranston', 'would', ""n't"", 'be', 'able', 'keep', 'show', 'afloat', 'terrific', 'support', 'members', 'cast', ""n't"", 'weak', 'link', 'them.The', 'second', 'season', 'even', 'better', 'first', 'pretty', 'strong', 'presentation', 'New', 'Mexico', 'blue', 'skies', 'positively', 'pop', 'blacks', 'are', 'pretty', 'strong', 'detail', 'exceptionally', 'good.Audio', 'sounds', 'marvelous', 'impressive', 'lossless', 'presentation', 'Dialog', 'pefectly', 'clear', 'subtitles', 'English', 'French', 'strangely', 'Spanish', 'SDH', 'English.Special', 'features', 'are', 'scattered', 'three', 'discs', 'majority', 'disc', 'three', 'get', 'four', 'audio', 'commentaries', 'featuring', 'Cranston', 'Gunn', 'RJ', 'Mitte', 'others', 'as', 'well', 'members', 'creative', 'team', 'writer-producer-creator', 'Vince', 'Gilligan', 'also', 'get', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'also', 'music', 'video', 'song', 'Negro', 'Y', 'Azul', 'odd', 'considering', 'episode', 'same', 'name.We', 'also', 'get', 'full', 'Better', 'Call', 'Saul', 'commericial', 'gag', 'reel', 'Cop', 'Talk', 'Dean', 'Norris', 'interviewing', 'police', 'consultants', 'also', 'get', 'six', 'webisodes', 'ONce', 'again', 'get', 'Vince', 'Gilligan', 'Photo', 'Gallery', 'as', 'well', 'assorted', 'short', 'featurettes.The', 'second', 'season', 'Breaking', 'Bad', 'builds', 'excellent', 'first', 'season', 'richer', 'deeper', 'performances', 'creator', 'Gilligan', 'able', 'expand', 'storyline', 'introduced', 'shorter', 'season', 'one', 'building', 'credible', 'fascinating', 'characters', 'putting', 'together', 'fascinating', 'twisted', 'modern', 'morality', 'play', 'where', 'Walt', 'continually', 'wrong', 'path']",Breaking Bad: Season 2

If we can watch it whenever we want we kind of start to take it for granted, or at the very least appreciate it less. I have this dilemma with just about any type of media, is it worth paying for it when I can watch it free on youtube? But Breaking Bad had me so totally drawn in that I didn't even ask myself if it would be worth buying. It was, and I did. Vince Gilligan created a universe so real but so unbelievable that you have to see what happens next. Season 2 really picks up the pace and, along with season 3, it's just one ""I can't believe it"" moment after another. Just when you think, ""there's no way they can top that"", they top that.

The premise sounded so improbable - a 50 year old high school chemistry teacher with a pregnant wife and a teenage son with cerebral palsy is diagnosed with lung cancer. He goes on a ride along with his DEA agent brother in law and sees an old student fleeing the house where the meth is being cooked. He sees the huge amounts of money to make in the meth trade. Since he's uninsured he decides to go into the meth business - he'll be the cook and his ex-student the dealer. Most meth dealers are not the kind of people you want to spend time with or even think about, but Brain Crandon (sp?) makes the protagonist sympathetic - an every man who has been screwed by life. Even the street dealer is someone you identify with, a young man who is a big disappointment to his family and trying to prove himself, albeit in a criminal enterprise. The chemistry between them is great, and they have many laugh out loud funny scenes. The whole cast is excellent.Season 2 started out in the same general vein, but towards the end veered off into something really disturbing and depressing. If the writers were trying to be more realistic about the ravages of meth on the customers, and the ruthlessness of the dealers, they succeeded. Walter White, the main character becomes ruthless to the point of cruelty even to his own son (getting him drunk at a family party celebrating his cancer going into remission) and trying to pick a fight his brother in law, who has been nothing but good to him. It get even worse, with a really neat character dying of an overdose.
