1668543,A3MEH37R79AD2S,B00ESFUED6,"Karl Anderson ""Global Recording Artists""","[8, 8]",Finally the wait is over! I was beginning to think we would never see the entire series of the Mod Squad release on DVD. What a wonderful set it is. The picture and sound quality a very good! These are all good solid transfers and look and sound as good as they ever did!  Spanning 39 DVDs you get the entire series from the first episode to the last who could ask for anything more except maybe the return of the mod squad TV movie from 78 would be the only thing left out!  I have been a fan since the 70's and have waited for this release for decades. In the mid 80s we go some teaser on VHS. The Teeth of Barrcuda pilot on tape and new line release 6 vhs tapes of episodes and that was it! Then we had the DVDs come out a few years ago and once again we go just two seasons and it stalled again. Finally we have all 5 years worth of the mod squad in on place! I would suggest you grab this set now before this too fades into obscurity! I have a feeling this will be the only time we will ever see the entire series available in one place.,5,I never thought I would see the day we would see the entire series of the Mod Squad released,1397520000,"04 15, 2014",2014,1042,"['Finally', 'wait', 'was', 'beginning', 'think', 'would', 'never', 'see', 'entire', 'series', 'Mod', 'Squad', 'release', 'DVD', 'What', 'wonderful', 'set', 'picture', 'sound', 'quality', 'very', 'good', 'are', 'good', 'solid', 'transfers', 'look', 'sound', 'as', 'good', 'ever', 'did', 'Spanning', '39', 'DVDs', 'get', 'entire', 'series', 'first', 'episode', 'last', 'who', 'could', 'ask', 'anything', 'more', 'maybe', 'return', 'mod', 'squad', 'TV', 'movie', '78', 'would', 'be', 'only', 'thing', 'left', 'out', 'have', 'been', 'fan', '70', 'have', 'waited', 'release', 'decades', 'mid', '80s', 'go', 'teaser', 'VHS', 'Teeth', 'Barrcuda', 'pilot', 'tape', 'new', 'line', 'release', '6', 'vhs', 'tapes', 'episodes', 'was', 'Then', 'had', 'DVDs', 'come', 'out', 'few', 'years', 'ago', 'once', 'again', 'go', 'just', 'two', 'seasons', 'stalled', 'again', 'Finally', 'have', '5', 'years', 'mod', 'squad', 'place', 'would', 'suggest', 'grab', 'set', 'now', 'too', 'obscurity', 'have', 'feeling', 'will', 'be', 'only', 'time', 'will', 'ever', 'see', 'entire', 'series', 'available', 'one', 'place']",N/A
1668544,A2ZELOPYDRS6VU,B00ESFUED6,Love Our Military Men,"[9, 9]","I have been waiting a long time for the last three seasons to be released and was very happy when Amazon ran a sale (for $89) on this late 60's, early 70's classic television series which starred Michael Cole as ""Pete Cochran"", Clarence Williams III as ""'Linc' Hayes"" and the soft spoken Peggy Lipton as ""Julie Barnes""! I watched these on a Samsung 60"" 1080 p HD TV set, and although the series clearly hasn't been remastered, I can honestly say I am pleasantly satisfied with the picture quality. This COMPLETE SERIES of THE MOD SQUAD comes in five amaray cases and a brief synopsis of each episode is located on the inside of the sleeve.

Ramm ""Steve Ramm &#34;Anything Phon...","[4, 8]","I remember watching this complete series when it was on ABC from 1968-73 but hadn't seen it again until I received a ""sample DVD"" from the folks at VEI (who took over releasing it after CBS Home Video stopped operating.). They have been releasing the individual seasons (each in two parts) and there are plenty of reviews by others of those. It appears that this is the first review of the COMPLETE set - which will be released on 11/19. I'm guessing that this is for the holiday buying season.  The box set includes four ""bonus featurettes"" which were produced by CBS when they began their reissues.Journalists were provided with a single DVD screener with three episodes (including the first one that runs 73 minutes (versus the normal 46 minutes; remember commercials have been excised). Two of the featurettes were included: First was the ""Forming the Squad"" one which runs nine minutes. The other is ""Inside `The Teeth of the Barracuda'"" (13 minutes) which discusses each character. The interviews are with both Peggy Lipton and Michael Cole and both were filmed at the same time.The image quality is decent - no change from the CBS volumes.So,  if you have been buying many of the sets individually , you probably don't need this full box - nothing new here. But it may be the only way to get ALL the seasons, since they seem to have stopped the individual ones at Season 5.I hope you found this review both informative and helpful (well, as much as I had to work with)Steve Ramm""Anything Phonographic""",4,"Review of this HUGE box based on one ""Sample"" disc - No NEW bonuses",1384560000,"11 16, 2013",2013,1508,"['remember', 'watching', 'complete', 'series', 'when', 'was', 'ABC', '1968-73', 'had', ""n't"", 'seen', 'again', 'received', 'sample', 'DVD', 'folks', 'VEI', 'who', 'took', 'over', 'releasing', 'CBS', 'Home', 'Video', 'stopped', 'operating.', 'have', 'been', 'releasing', 'individual', 'seasons', 'two', 'parts', 'are', 'plenty', 'reviews', 'others', 'first', 'review', 'COMPLETE', 'set', 'will', 'be', 'released', '11/19', ""'m"", 'guessing', 'holiday', 'buying', 'season', 'box', 'set', 'four', 'bonus', 'featurettes', 'were', 'produced', 'CBS', 'when', 'began', 'reissues.Journalists', 'were', 'provided', 'single', 'DVD', 'screener', 'three', 'episodes', 'including', 'first', 'one', '73', 'minutes', 'normal', '46', 'minutes', 'remember', 'commercials', 'have', 'been', 'excised', 'Two', 'featurettes', 'were', 'included', 'First', 'was', 'Forming', 'Squad', 'one', 'nine', 'minutes', 'other', 'Inside', 'Teeth', 'Barracuda', '13', 'minutes', 'character', 'interviews', 'are', 'Peggy', 'Lipton', 'Michael', 'Cole', 'were', 'filmed', 'same', 'time.The', 'image', 'quality', 'decent', 'change', 'CBS', 'volumes.So', 'have', 'been', 'buying', 'many', 'sets', 'individually', 'probably', 'do', ""n't"", 'need', 'full', 'box', 'nothing', 'new', 'here', 'may', 'be', 'only', 'way', 'get', 'seasons', 'seem', 'have', 'stopped', 'individual', 'ones', 'Season', '5.I', 'hope', 'found', 'review', 'informative', 'helpful', 'well', 'as', 'much', 'had', 'work', 'Steve', 'Ramm', 'Anything', 'Phonographic']",N/A
