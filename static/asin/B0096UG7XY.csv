The Men Next Door is most certainly not a ""cliche"" movie about ""gays"" or about the ""gay agenda"".The Men Next Door is a beautiful movie that shows its audience that Love comes in many variations. Regardless, of the ""mainstream"" kind of ""Love"" that is pumped from the social media of our society. There is a kind of Love that never gets old and that has been placed in an individuals heart all along for that one special person, and it will always remain there as those individuals go through their journey we call Life. This is beautiful movie that catches the eye of many who like to have an after feeling of thought, contentedness, and a heart-warming, heart-felt laugh throughout the movie. It is beautiful written and directed and ALL of the characters are portrayed beautifully! :)  I loved this movie a lot and it is definitely a movie that I will own to watch again and make me feel good and look towards my future so that through my journey as I keep going, that I will find my loved one as well. I highly recommend this movie, I promise that you will not be sold short and want your money back! :)  I can see why this movie won so many awards it is absolutely flawlessly done and I could tell that this movie was not just a ""quick"" movie to be done, but rather a movie that wanted to be seen as it is, A Love Story.Highly recommend this movie!

It's simply not easy aging in the gay community, and being older on the gay dating scene is particularly challenging.  The criticisms that some Amazon reviewers have made of this film didn't hold true for me.  The production values were remarkably strong for an Indie.  There were at least six distinctly different locations for the action -- a Pilates studio, &#34;Doug's&#34; house, &#34;Colton's&#34; rental, &#34;Jacob's&#34; mountain cabin, &#34;Derek's&#34; house & patio, and &#34;Evelyn's&#34; kitchen.  The gay male characters weren't particularly butch or femme, they were just guys.  The one exception was the flamboyant comic relief provided by &#34;Doug's&#34; employee at the Pilates studio. The gratuitous full-frontal nudity of actor Mark Cirillo was a pleasant surprise, and made me look at him in a different light, having just seen him in another gay-themed indie this weekend.  On balance, this film was a delightful way to spend a little time on Christmas afternoon.  And, best of all, the story ended far differently than I expected.

And while this is going on, he continues to entertain both father and son as far as going on dates, taking trips and of course a lot of sleeping around. And while there are some nuances to each of their personalities, it almost feels like it does not matter who they are and it's all up to Doug.But what becomes frustrating is that Doug isn't actually taking steps to figure things out. Instead he just goes on having fun, which may be generally realistic, but it doesn't make it any less annoying. I would still think that any regular guy would actually take more action to help him &#34;choose&#34;, although why Jacob and Colton feel Doug should take the lead is a little beyond me. So I guess they get what they deserve in this regard.Moving beyond this little quagmire in the middle of things, the rest of the movie isn't quite bad but isn't remarkable either. Acting is passable with both good and bad moments. The guys are relatively hot (which somehow still matters in these movies), although we are stuck in the stereotypes that gay men quaff wine by the case at any given moment.The movie is described as a &#34;fast-paced comedy&#34;, but I didn't necessarily feel that. Maybe it was the lack of musical scoring for most of the movie (which may more a trope for comedies than a necessity) or the lack of narrative progress as we wait for Doug to even just begin to make a decision about the two men in his life. Thankfully, they never have a threesome.The Men Next Door had a theoretically funny premise but didn't really know where it wanted to take things.

Then on the night of Doug's actual fortieth birthday he invites all his friends around, and they all fail to show for various reasons. His brother does send a stripogram though, only it's a lady. Then hunky next door neighbour calls round with some mis delivered mail and things sort of happen, as they only can in the movies.Any way his bestest gal pal Evelyn (Heidi Rhodes) turns up and catches them, but she is actually really supportive and Doug decides to see both men as Colton is thirty he has one lover ten years older and one ten years younger - possibly a dream come true. Colton is played by Benjamin Lutz who you may remember from `The Love Patient' and as ever is really rather good. But there is always going to be a problem with trying to see both men and his schedule gets busier and busier and it is inevitable that both men will eventually meet, even though they know it is an open relationship, but the real big deal is that they are father and son - oh very dear indeed.Anyway this is billed as a fast paced gay comedy, well it is not my idea of fast to be honest and I did not find myself reaching for the Kleenex to wipe away tears of mirth - or for any other reason as there is not that much in the way of bed room diversion either let alone a gratuitous shower scene; never mind. However, that said I found this to be a rather an awkward funny and as such much more of a drama. There are some well observed lighter moments, but selling it on the gags is a bit mis leading. The acting is all above par and Eric Dean is a great leading man, we even get Mark Cirillo (Going Down in La La Land) doing a good supporting role, and at a ninety minute run it is a satisfying film in many ways.This does deal with the obsession of youth rather well which is often missing from main stream films let alone those of this genre. So if you like a warm love drama and like a gay film that is not an excuse for lots of rumpy pumpy then you will find something here of interest.",4,Awkward Drama That Sort of Works.,1359763200,"02 2, 2013",2013,2169,"['Doug', 'Eric', 'Dean', 'Arizona', 'Sky', 'forty', 'year', 'old', 'gay', 'man', 'who', 'dating', 'fifty', 'year', 'old', 'man', 'Jacob', 'Michael', 'Nicklin', 'are', 'getting', 'along', 'just', 'fine', 'not', 'ready', 'commit', 'Then', 'night', 'Doug', 'actual', 'fortieth', 'birthday', 'friends', 'fail', 'show', 'various', 'reasons', 'brother', 'send', 'stripogram', 'only', 'lady', 'Then', 'hunky', 'next', 'door', 'neighbour', 'round', 'mis', 'delivered', 'mail', 'things', 'sort', 'happen', 'only', 'can', 'movies.Any', 'way', 'bestest', 'gal', 'pal', 'Evelyn', 'Heidi', 'Rhodes', 'up', 'catches', 'actually', 'really', 'supportive', 'Doug', 'see', 'men', 'Colton', 'thirty', 'one', 'lover', 'ten', 'years', 'older', 'one', 'ten', 'years', 'younger', 'possibly', 'dream', 'come', 'true', 'Colton', 'played', 'Benjamin', 'Lutz', 'who', 'may', 'remember', 'Love', 'Patient', 'ever', 'really', 'rather', 'good', 'always', 'going', 'be', 'problem', 'trying', 'see', 'men', 'schedule', 'busier', 'busier', 'inevitable', 'men', 'will', 'eventually', 'meet', 'even', 'know', 'open', 'relationship', 'real', 'big', 'deal', 'are', 'father', 'son', 'oh', 'very', 'dear', 'indeed.Anyway', 'billed', 'fast', 'paced', 'gay', 'comedy', 'well', 'not', 'idea', 'fast', 'be', 'honest', 'did', 'not', 'find', 'reaching', 'Kleenex', 'wipe', 'away', 'tears', 'mirth', 'other', 'reason', 'not', 'that', 'much', 'way', 'bed', 'room', 'diversion', 'let', 'alone', 'gratuitous', 'shower', 'scene', 'never', 'mind', 'However', 'said', 'found', 'be', 'rather', 'awkward', 'funny', 'such', 'much', 'more', 'drama', 'are', 'well', 'observed', 'lighter', 'moments', 'selling', 'gags', 'bit', 'mis', 'leading', 'acting', 'par', 'Eric', 'Dean', 'great', 'leading', 'man', 'even', 'get', 'Mark', 'Cirillo', 'Going', 'Down', 'La', 'La', 'Land', 'doing', 'good', 'supporting', 'role', 'ninety', 'minute', 'run', 'satisfying', 'film', 'many', 'ways.This', 'deal', 'obsession', 'youth', 'rather', 'well', 'often', 'missing', 'main', 'stream', 'films', 'let', 'alone', 'genre', 'So', 'like', 'warm', 'love', 'drama', 'gay', 'film', 'not', 'excuse', 'lots', 'rumpy', 'pumpy', 'then', 'will', 'find', 'something', 'here', 'interest']",The Men Next Door
