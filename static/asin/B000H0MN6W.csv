1008810,A2S0DU8QTQSKWK,B000H0MN6W,Brendon Spencer,"[2, 2]","Bad acting, endless loops of the same scenes, dumb action, and -- this is the worst -- crappy special effects.A white haired indian spends the first 10 minutes of the film walking across the desert. The action is thrilling, yawn, beyond measure.  The acting, even more so. He puts ""something"" in the burial ground all the while being menaced by an incredibly bad not-the-least-bit-special effect. Then he staggers off the release a couple of demon eggs and bring about the end of the world.It's at this point one begins to wonder if that might not be a good thing.Enter an RV full of expendibles plus an annoying old man. In a huge empty desert they still manage to run over the indian. Ah, this may be the highlight of the story!  Anyway, one of the expendibles brings an egg into the RV, it hatches (SHADES OF ALIEN!!) and promptly goes for an expendible throat in a way that make you wish this were real. Trust me on this one, a third graders school play would have had better, more realistic, action than this.It meanders on until everyone watching is throwing popcorn at the television and yelling at the charactors. You'll notice I didn't say ""actors"". That's because there aren't any in this thing. I'd go on with the story line but what's the point?Pass this one by.

I turned on my DVD and projector, popped some popcorn and watched the big screen knowing this was a low budget no big actor flic. I was delighted with what I saw. The plot was simple but steady and the editing was concise with minimum continuity issues. The low budget shows through with the special effects and monster puppets, but it was LOW budget and a story is being told that actually was intriguing. I wanted to watch to the end to see the reveal of the plot. I love watching low budget indi films and seen some that I could not stand to talk about.The movie sort of reminded me of the old Rick Baker flic &#34;It's Alive&#34; made in the 70s, New born baby gone wild with mutant strength but with an archaeological twist.Don't go in expecting &#34;Saw&#34; or Friday the 13th.

1008814,A370Z6I5GBWU44,B000H0MN6W,"M ""Delicious Strawberry""","[1, 1]","Very rarely do I see a movie so awful that it is comparable to Manos: The Hands of Fate, but this movie certainly gives that one a run for its money!The opening scene is downright ridiculous. For several WHOLE minutes, we see this Native American dude walking through the desert. For several minutes. No dialogue or anything. Just walking... and walking... and walking... and walking...And then some young'uns (and an old dude) come along in a RV. They find an egg. Rather than checking around for the mom or dad of this egg, they just take it and set it on the table in their RV. The acting is atrocious, it seemed that no one had any acting experience (I'm probably right on this, anyway)The baby hatches. It is immediately apparent that it is just a cheap rubber doll. Every time the baby attacks someone, the scene consists of the 'victim' grasping the doll to their chest as they flail around and make fake-looking expressions of pain or terror. The one scene I remember the most is this one girl getting ready for the shower. The camera spends an inordinate amount of time taping her getting undressed (obviously for the T and A) She then goes inside, where the camera spends some more time ogling her washing. The demon child attacks her, resulting in another fake-looking attack/dying scene.When the girl finally dies, her body slumps out of the shower, so her head and arm is visible, dangling out. HOWEVER, when her friends find her, she is not in this position. Her body is found curled up in the far corner of the shower. A dead person certainly can't curl up to die after the fact, can they? Derp.The rest of the movie is not much better. What is supposed to be a scary film as evinced by the title is anything but. The end of the movie was confusing, and some girl was screaming and screaming and the Native American guy apparently didn't care about it.
