1319993,A3KF4IP2MUS8QQ,B0033HKBNI,"Daniel Jolley ""darkgenius""","[0, 1]","Don't let the title and DVD cover fool you - heck, I think the plot summary is misleading, as well.  This isn't a film about the restless ghosts of the ill-fated Donner Party rising up from their snowy graves to terrorize a group of friends stranded inside a lonely cabin in the Sierra Nevada range.  You aren't going to see steaming hunks of human flesh coloring the snow red, either.  Frankly, I'm quite glad that Necrosis was not the film I was expecting because what I was expecting was yet another predictable and utterly forgettable horror survival thriller.  There are far too many Cabin Fever clones polluting the horror field already, but Necrosis is not one of them.  In this case, I do believe that less is more.  By the way, I'm assuming that we are all clear on the identity and meaning of the Donner Party in this context - if you think the Donner Party has something to do with reindeer, then go read a book and educate yourself.OK.  Having scored a great deal on a primo cabin in the Sierra Nevada Mountains, Matt (George Stults) and Karen (Tiffany) head up there with four friends to enjoy a weekend of invigorating, stress-free fun and relaxation.  The locals (including horror icon Michael Berryman) are a little weird about the idea of staying there, but Matt already knows the history of the cabin.  Located in the same area as the Donner Party's ill-fated campsite, the woods outside the cabin are said to be haunted by the ghosts of those who died during the winter of 1846.  Maybe the locals were right in their warnings about the place, though.  Poor Jerry (James Kyson Lee) starts seeing disfigured, axe-toting spirits soon after arriving, while his girlfriend Megan (Penny Drake) almost goes and gets herself killed accidentally.  Then, that very night, the guys discover something disturbing in the woods, and - wouldn't you know it - an unpredicted snowstorm blows in, making it impossible to drive down the mountain in the case of an emergency.  Suddenly, there are more important things to think about than the odds of Michael (Robert Michael Ryan) and Samantha (Danielle De Luca) hooking up.There really isn't a great deal of action or suspense in play here, and that explains some of this film's negative reviews.  On the other hand, I actually found these characters real and likeable (well, all but Jerry) and enjoyed seeing a little character development play out.  I also found that my expectations for the film made the actual plot more effective.  I kept waiting for everyone to see the ghosts and freak out, not to mention wondering if any cannibalism would find its way into the story.  All the while, the film traveled steadfastly on its own path, never caving in to give viewers what most of them probably expect.  While some may find the actual storyline somewhat pedestrian, I think it works pretty well.  Some actual scares would have been nice, but I still rather enjoyed this film - and, at seventy-six minutes, it doesn't overextend its welcome.  I even enjoyed the end credits - largely because they were accompanied by a Tiffany song I had never heard before.",3,Not what you're probably expecting -- and that can be a good thing,1332720000,"03 26, 2012",2012,3110,"['Do', ""n't"", 'let', 'title', 'DVD', 'cover', 'fool', 'heck', 'think', 'plot', 'summary', 'misleading', 'as', 'well', ""n't"", 'film', 'restless', 'ghosts', 'ill-fated', 'Donner', 'Party', 'rising', 'up', 'snowy', 'graves', 'terrorize', 'group', 'friends', 'stranded', 'lonely', 'cabin', 'Sierra', 'Nevada', 'range', 'are', ""n't"", 'going', 'see', 'steaming', 'hunks', 'human', 'flesh', 'coloring', 'snow', 'red', 'either', 'Frankly', ""'m"", 'quite', 'glad', 'Necrosis', 'was', 'not', 'film', 'was', 'expecting', 'what', 'was', 'expecting', 'was', 'yet', 'predictable', 'utterly', 'forgettable', 'horror', 'survival', 'thriller', 'are', 'far', 'too', 'many', 'Cabin', 'Fever', 'clones', 'polluting', 'horror', 'field', 'already', 'Necrosis', 'not', 'one', 'case', 'do', 'believe', 'less', 'more', 'way', ""'m"", 'assuming', 'are', 'clear', 'identity', 'meaning', 'Donner', 'Party', 'context', 'think', 'Donner', 'Party', 'something', 'do', 'reindeer', 'then', 'go', 'read', 'book', 'educate', 'yourself.OK', 'Having', 'scored', 'great', 'deal', 'primo', 'cabin', 'Sierra', 'Nevada', 'Mountains', 'Matt', 'George', 'Stults', 'Karen', 'Tiffany', 'head', 'there', 'four', 'friends', 'enjoy', 'weekend', 'invigorating', 'stress-free', 'fun', 'relaxation', 'locals', 'including', 'horror', 'icon', 'Michael', 'Berryman', 'are', 'little', 'weird', 'idea', 'staying', 'there', 'Matt', 'already', 'history', 'cabin', 'Located', 'same', 'area', 'Donner', 'Party', 'ill-fated', 'campsite', 'woods', 'cabin', 'are', 'said', 'be', 'haunted', 'ghosts', 'who', 'died', 'winter', '1846', 'Maybe', 'locals', 'were', 'right', 'warnings', 'place', 'though', 'Poor', 'Jerry', 'James', 'Kyson', 'Lee', 'seeing', 'disfigured', 'axe-toting', 'spirits', 'soon', 'arriving', 'girlfriend', 'Megan', 'Penny', 'Drake', 'almost', 'killed', 'accidentally', 'Then', 'very', 'night', 'guys', 'something', 'disturbing', 'woods', 'would', ""n't"", 'know', 'unpredicted', 'snowstorm', 'blows', 'making', 'impossible', 'drive', 'down', 'mountain', 'case', 'emergency', 'Suddenly', 'are', 'more', 'important', 'things', 'think', 'odds', 'Michael', 'Robert', 'Michael', 'Ryan', 'Samantha', 'Danielle', 'De', 'Luca', 'hooking', 'up.There', 'really', ""n't"", 'great', 'deal', 'action', 'suspense', 'play', 'here', 'film', 'negative', 'reviews', 'other', 'hand', 'actually', 'found', 'characters', 'real', 'likeable', 'well', 'Jerry', 'enjoyed', 'seeing', 'little', 'character', 'development', 'play', 'also', 'found', 'expectations', 'film', 'made', 'actual', 'plot', 'more', 'effective', 'kept', 'waiting', 'everyone', 'see', 'ghosts', 'freak', 'out', 'not', 'mention', 'wondering', 'cannibalism', 'would', 'find', 'way', 'story', 'while', 'film', 'traveled', 'steadfastly', 'own', 'path', 'never', 'caving', 'give', 'viewers', 'what', 'most', 'probably', 'expect', 'may', 'find', 'actual', 'storyline', 'somewhat', 'pedestrian', 'think', 'pretty', 'well', 'actual', 'scares', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'nice', 'still', 'rather', 'enjoyed', 'film', 'seventy-six', 'minutes', ""n't"", 'overextend', 'welcome', 'even', 'enjoyed', 'end', 'largely', 'were', 'accompanied', 'Tiffany', 'song', 'had', 'never', 'heard']",N/A

While nothing new was offered to the horror genre, I was entertained by the acting, effects, and The Donner Party. Oh, how I love The Donner Party, and their story that keeps coming back in horror films. I believe this is not a trend that will end soon. The acting, TIFFANY(80's pop star) that everyone had a crush on is back, and is acting in this film! She was great to watch, that alone made my night. JAMES KYSON LEE (Ando from Heroes) shows us that he doesn't just play sidekicks, he can a very brutal person too. George Stults (7th Heaven), Micheal Berryman(The Hills Have Eyes), Penny Drake, and the very pretty Danielle De Luca. Why isn't she in more films! The effects were actually top notch. Normally I would think that a film like this would lack great effects, but there was nothing to complain about at all. I was happy.
