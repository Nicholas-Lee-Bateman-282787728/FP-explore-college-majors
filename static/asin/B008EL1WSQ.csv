Mr. Wilson's work has already been familiarto me by several fine CD's.  The musicianship displayed here is superb, as are Mr. Wilson'saccurate recreations of the MGM arrangements. The musicians seemedto be as enthusiastic as the audience.  British musicians are definitely second to none. Get this,you won't be disappointed.

However, the sound on this DVD is much deeper with greater fidelity than was present in those 1940 plus movies.  The images were clear. The video direction was crisp with very few distracting shots.  If you are interested in hearing a lot of the classic movie songs one after another this will be a great DVD.  If you want the songs in context watch the movies they came from.",4,This DVD provided a pleasant afternoon of entertainment,1360540800,"02 11, 2013",2013,482,"['am', 'not', 'sure', 'reconstruction', 'can', 'match', 'songs', 'originally', 'performed', 'individual', 'movies', 'However', 'sound', 'DVD', 'much', 'greater', 'fidelity', 'was', 'present', '1940', 'movies', 'images', 'were', 'clear', 'video', 'direction', 'was', 'crisp', 'very', 'few', 'distracting', 'shots', 'are', 'interested', 'hearing', 'lot', 'classic', 'movie', 'songs', 'one', 'will', 'be', 'great', 'DVD', 'want', 'songs', 'context', 'watch', 'movies', 'came']",N/A

This is by far the best and most exhilarating concert I've ever seen.  Who would think the ""Broadway Melody"" number from Singing In The Rain would be a knockout, (the audience breaks out in applause in the middle!) but it is. If you like this type of music even a little, do yourself a favor and order this.",5,"DVD IS OVER TWO HOURS, NOT 90 MINUTES!",1348704000,"09 27, 2012",2012,448,"['Amazon', 'product', 'description', 'DVD', '90', 'minutes', 'incorrect', 'Actual', 'running', 'time', 'stated', 'DVD', 'case', '124', 'minutes', 'far', 'best', 'most', 'exhilarating', 'concert', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'seen', 'Who', 'would', 'think', 'Broadway', 'Melody', 'number', 'Singing', 'Rain', 'would', 'be', 'knockout', 'audience', 'out', 'applause', 'middle', 'like', 'type', 'music', 'even', 'little', 'do', 'favor', 'order']",N/A
1551218,A2TO31D8XDFPZR,B008EL1WSQ,Roger Blunck,"[5, 5]","This DVD is full of MGM musical magic.  John Wilson has done a magnificent job bringing to life music from the classic MGM musicals exactly as they originated (with singing chorus & vocals). This is quite an accomplishment as much of the original material had been destroyed. It's obvious the man loves his work. Simply watch as he conducts.  He's like a kid in a candy store.  The  orchestra outdoes itself enjoying the challenge of the MGM arrangers with audience and players amazed that something from 1943 sounds as good today as it did then. There are points where the audience can't help but burst into applause. There is such joy in the delivery it surrounds and takes you to a unexpected musical high.  Thank God they captured this on DVD.  When it was shown on PBS it was cut.  This is the complete concert.  The singers do a fine job with a couple of exceptions.  But if you know this material as well as I do you can't help but long to hear the voices of Judy Garland, Gene Kelly, Fred Astaire, Jane Powell, Ann Blyth etc. delivering their songs.  There's no doubt it was an era of magnificent musical talent and will never be again. This is a wonderful reminder of what true music magic can be.  Look, listen and enjoy.  And God bless John Wilson for his hard work and reminding us that, even though some 60-years have passed, it has endured and still sounds great.",5,A Magnificent Concert--God Bless John Wilson & MGM!,1350172800,"10 14, 2012",2012,1377,"['DVD', 'full', 'MGM', 'musical', 'magic', 'John', 'Wilson', 'done', 'magnificent', 'job', 'bringing', 'life', 'music', 'classic', 'MGM', 'musicals', 'exactly', 'originated', 'singing', 'chorus', 'vocals', 'quite', 'accomplishment', 'much', 'original', 'material', 'had', 'been', 'destroyed', 'obvious', 'man', 'work', 'Simply', 'watch', 'kid', 'candy', 'store', 'orchestra', 'enjoying', 'challenge', 'MGM', 'arrangers', 'audience', 'players', 'amazed', 'something', '1943', 'sounds', 'good', 'today', 'did', 'then', 'are', 'points', 'where', 'audience', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'burst', 'applause', 'such', 'joy', 'delivery', 'unexpected', 'musical', 'high', 'Thank', 'God', 'captured', 'DVD', 'When', 'was', 'shown', 'PBS', 'was', 'cut', 'complete', 'concert', 'singers', 'do', 'fine', 'job', 'couple', 'exceptions', 'know', 'material', 'as', 'well', 'do', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'long', 'hear', 'voices', 'Judy', 'Garland', 'Gene', 'Kelly', 'Fred', 'Astaire', 'Jane', 'Powell', 'Ann', 'Blyth', 'etc', 'delivering', 'songs', 'doubt', 'was', 'era', 'magnificent', 'musical', 'talent', 'will', 'never', 'be', 'again', 'wonderful', 'reminder', 'what', 'true', 'music', 'magic', 'can', 'be', 'Look', 'listen', 'enjoy', 'God', 'bless', 'John', 'Wilson', 'hard', 'work', 'reminding', 'even', '60-years', 'have', 'passed', 'endured', 'still', 'great']",N/A
