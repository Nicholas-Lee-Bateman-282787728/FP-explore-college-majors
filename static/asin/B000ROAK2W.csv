However, I find myself really enjoying a couple of their latest releases (this movie and Ratitoulle). Meet the Robinsons has an outstanding moral message, ""Keep Moving Forward."" Learning from the past without living in it is a lesson most adults have not mastered, let alone children. This movie really illustrates this moral concept well, and it just so happens to be an entertaining film as well! In an age of moral relativisim and blatant impurity all around us it's enlightening to experience a wholesome family film with a solid message. If you have children this movie could operate as a catalyst for an open discussion over an important life lesson. This film is cute, has a firm moral base, and is delightful to watch; a truly rare find in the current coercive environment we live in. Watch this film, I'm positive you and your family enjoy it as much as mine did.

Either way you receive excellent family entertainment, even if there are elements of the film you've seen before.  Resembling an animated version of `Back to the Future' or `Peggy Sue Got Married,' `Meet the Robinsons' is a briskly based, nicely woven tale about belonging and achieving.Starting we find the typical desperate mother leaving her baby on the orphanage steps.  Her son Louis becomes a nervous inventor at the orphanage and a nuisance to everyone, especially his long-suffering roommate, Goob.  Having an intellectual disposition doesn't help him in adoption interviews, and ingenious inventions that seldom work, don't endear him at school.  Add to that a pure villain comes upon his scene, known as ""Bowler Hat Man"" (Whose hat makes him like a nimble, but less scary nemesis comparable to ""Dr. Oct"".) his life comes into disarray at science fair he's finally sure he'll win.Using time travel well and peril and humor that truly entertain, `..Robinsons' message to always persevere and the plot's neat and heart-felt resolution will make every family member smile.(This being my first 3-D adventure that actually worked certainly gave the movie a lift, too!)",4,"Past, Present, and Future Weave Entertaining Flight",1177804800,"04 29, 2007",2007,1270,"['Evaluating', 'Meet', 'Robinsons', 'depends', 'entered', 'theater', 'offering', '3-D', 'glasses', 'way', 'receive', 'excellent', 'family', 'entertainment', 'even', 'are', 'elements', 'film', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'Resembling', 'animated', 'version', 'Back', 'Future', 'Peggy', 'Sue', 'Got', 'Married', 'Meet', 'Robinsons', 'briskly', 'based', 'nicely', 'woven', 'tale', 'belonging', 'achieving.Starting', 'find', 'typical', 'desperate', 'mother', 'leaving', 'baby', 'orphanage', 'steps', 'son', 'Louis', 'nervous', 'inventor', 'orphanage', 'nuisance', 'everyone', 'especially', 'long-suffering', 'roommate', 'Goob', 'Having', 'intellectual', 'disposition', ""n't"", 'help', 'adoption', 'interviews', 'ingenious', 'inventions', 'seldom', 'work', 'do', ""n't"", 'endear', 'school', 'Add', 'pure', 'villain', 'scene', 'known', 'Bowler', 'Hat', 'Man', 'Whose', 'nimble', 'less', 'scary', 'nemesis', 'comparable', 'Dr', 'Oct', 'life', 'disarray', 'science', 'fair', 'finally', 'sure', ""'ll"", 'win.Using', 'time', 'travel', 'well', 'peril', 'humor', 'truly', 'entertain', '..Robinsons', 'message', 'always', 'persevere', 'plot', 'neat', 'heart-felt', 'resolution', 'will', 'make', 'family', 'member', 'smile', 'being', 'first', '3-D', 'adventure', 'actually', 'worked', 'certainly', 'gave', 'movie', 'lift', 'too']",N/A

It can be so easy to give up when things do not go our way, just as it is in this movie.

The jokes are not all dirty or crude but will get you laughing just the same.  At certain points I was having to fight just to breath from laughing so hard.All the characters are great.  Each one brings a new dynamic to the movie.  I especially enjoyed the main villian.  They did a really good job of bringing his character out and developing him.

I can't say that it's the best cartoon that's come out this year (that title belongs to a certain rat movie) but I can say that when the credits started to roll I was content with the final outcome.  It pushes the sentimentality in a way that only Disney can get away with (sometimes it very syrupy and otherwise kind of agonizingly sentimental) but it makes up for it in other areas.  It has some very positive morals for young children and adults alike and is sure to excite many young faces and please many attentive parents.The story follows young Lewis, a 12-year-old orphan who just wants to find a family that wants him.  After several (and I mean SEVERAL) failed attempts he decides that if only he could find his birth mother then maybe she would want him and he could be happy.  It helps that Lewis is a kid obsessed with science and invents gadgets like crazy so he spends every waking moment inventing a machine that will capture stored memories, that way he can go back to the night his mother left him at the orphanage and see her face; that way he can find her.Lewis is accosted by Wilbur, a young kid claiming to be from the future.  He warns Lewis that a strange man in a bowler hat is looking for him.  What happens next sends Lewis on a crazy adventure in the future where he meets Wilbur's family, the Robinsons, and battles the bowler hat guy and his evil sidekick Doris.The story, in the end, is all about having self confidence and never giving up in what you believe in.  It's about accepting who you are and how it's only then that people will accept you and the ending is so sweet (despite it's apparent sappiness) that it brought a tear to my eye (I swear, becoming a father has made me an emotional mess).Like I said, I can't say that `Meet the Robinsons' is a complete triumph for there are many areas that could have been improved upon.  It starts a little slow (and somewhat corny) but it builds and ends on a very nice note.  It's definitely a cartoon targeting children.  I think that is where a lot of adults may lose it.  This is not in the vein of `Shrek' or even `Ratatouille'; it does not cater to the parents.  A lot of the humor is immature and at a child's level (think `Monster House') but it is fun and exciting in many parts and will surely entertain an adult in the least.",3,It's a cartoon for kids; but that doesn't mean us adults can't enjoy it...,1207526400,"04 7, 2008",2008,2495,"['Sure', 'very', 'much', 'Back', 'Future', 'children', 'are', 'more', 'few', 'similarities', 'be', 'seen', 'here', 'Meet', 'Robinsons', 'lot', 'charm', 'own', 'as', 'well', 'ca', ""n't"", 'say', 'best', 'cartoon', 'come', 'out', 'year', 'title', 'belongs', 'certain', 'rat', 'movie', 'can', 'say', 'when', 'credits', 'started', 'roll', 'was', 'content', 'final', 'outcome', 'sentimentality', 'way', 'only', 'Disney', 'can', 'get', 'away', 'sometimes', 'very', 'syrupy', 'otherwise', 'kind', 'agonizingly', 'sentimental', 'up', 'other', 'areas', 'very', 'positive', 'morals', 'young', 'children', 'adults', 'alike', 'sure', 'excite', 'many', 'young', 'please', 'many', 'attentive', 'parents.The', 'story', 'young', 'Lewis', '12-year-old', 'orphan', 'who', 'just', 'find', 'family', 'several', 'mean', 'SEVERAL', 'failed', 'attempts', 'only', 'could', 'find', 'birth', 'mother', 'then', 'maybe', 'would', 'want', 'could', 'be', 'happy', 'Lewis', 'kid', 'obsessed', 'science', 'invents', 'gadgets', 'crazy', 'waking', 'moment', 'inventing', 'machine', 'will', 'capture', 'stored', 'memories', 'way', 'can', 'go', 'back', 'night', 'mother', 'left', 'orphanage', 'see', 'face', 'way', 'can', 'find', 'her.Lewis', 'accosted', 'Wilbur', 'young', 'kid', 'claiming', 'be', 'future', 'Lewis', 'strange', 'man', 'bowler', 'hat', 'looking', 'What', 'next', 'sends', 'Lewis', 'crazy', 'adventure', 'future', 'where', 'Wilbur', 'family', 'Robinsons', 'bowler', 'hat', 'guy', 'evil', 'sidekick', 'Doris.The', 'story', 'end', 'having', 'self', 'confidence', 'never', 'giving', 'up', 'what', 'believe', 'accepting', 'who', 'are', 'how', 'only', 'then', 'people', 'will', 'accept', 'ending', 'so', 'sweet', 'apparent', 'sappiness', 'brought', 'tear', 'eye', 'swear', 'becoming', 'father', 'made', 'emotional', 'mess', '.Like', 'said', 'ca', ""n't"", 'say', 'Meet', 'Robinsons', 'complete', 'triumph', 'are', 'many', 'areas', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'improved', 'little', 'slow', 'somewhat', 'corny', 'very', 'nice', 'note', 'definitely', 'cartoon', 'targeting', 'children', 'think', 'where', 'lot', 'adults', 'may', 'lose', 'not', 'vein', 'Shrek', 'even', 'Ratatouille', 'not', 'cater', 'parents', 'lot', 'humor', 'immature', 'child', 'level', 'think', 'Monster', 'House', 'fun', 'exciting', 'many', 'parts', 'will', 'surely', 'entertain', 'adult', 'least']",N/A

While it's not hard to figure out the whole puzzle by half of the movie, the sub-stories are badly woven to each other. They tried to come up with interesting characters for the Robinsons, or so they thought, but then they didn't use much of them in the story line. Trying to digest or appreciate this abundance and redundancy of characters and sub-stories is like ironically trying to digest a poorly proportioned peanut butter and jam sandwich (a reference to an invention of Lewis).

His trademark design and look is all over this film. The moment I saw the look of the future in this movie I knew he had something to with it. His artwork is unique and easily recognizable if you're familiar with his work; it has a charming and nostalgic appeal, and his colors are great.The film is entertaining stuff that is fine family viewing. It is far superior to an earlier Disney CGI release, Chicken Little. Boys from seven to ten will really like this movie. Its mix of adventure, good against evil, science project mayhem, time travel, wacky family members, action, and slapstick is a winning combination. As an adult I appreciated the designs and the comedy. The villain is wonderful, and reminded me of a funny version of Snidely Whiplash, of the Rocky & Bullwinkle Show from the 1960's.The movie is rather touching in parts, and will really tug at the heartstrings of adopted children and their families.And having seen this right after watching Ratatouille, I should say that while the latter is technically wonderful and has a great location (Paris), the story and characters in Meet the Robinsons appealed more to me than the those in Ratatouille.While not an outstanding success like Finding Nemo, Meet the Robinsons is still worthy of your time.

1083352,A1HBC0NBQJHT7X,B000ROAK2W,Bookphile,"[3, 4]","This movie is very unlike anything Disney has done before and I think that works both for and against it.  Because it is a Disney film, I went into it with the expectation that it would be like Disney's fairy tale-based films.  I have to admit that the first time I saw it I thought it was rather strange and wasn't sure if I really liked it.  But a repeat viewing changed my mind.I see now that this was a good risk for Disney.  It's nice for them to do something different, to take on stories that diverge from the traditional fairy tale format.  While I do enjoy those films and while they do often contain very worthwhile messages (such as Beauty and the Beast's moral of not judging others by their appearances), this film seems more mature and deals with some very worthwhile issues.  I really like its theme of the importance of family, of finding a place where one belongs, and, of course, it's message that we should always ""keep moving forward"".  To paraphrase one of the characters, we often do learn more from our failures than our successes and, as a parent, I think it's very important for children to understand that while they will fail the important thing is the dogged pursuit of goals.The highlight of this movie for me, though, is the way the characters are treated.  Lewis is an unusual kid and it takes an unusual family to appreciate him.  I like that he doesn't have to change who he is, he simply has to find those who will accept him for what he is.  This sends a powerful message about how we can all miss out on a great deal if we don't stop to see the potential in others.  This message isn't lost on Lewis either who takes the time to rectify a past wrong caused indirectly by him, even as he's in a hurry to set into motion a chain of events that will change his life for the better.

1083365,A18G7GG53G2X8A,B000ROAK2W,Chris Pandolfi,"[2, 3]","""Meet the Robinsons"" has a strange effect: it's entertaining and baffling at the same time, a good-hearted story with gags aplenty. In traditional Disney fashion, it presents a simple yet effective human tale, weaving numerous messages about family and friendship throughout. Just as traditional is an overabundance of silliness, with every other visual and line of dialogue being some kind of joke. I'm still at a loss to explain why this method only works some of the time; an overactive sense of humor is usually indicative of a weak film, lacking in both story and characterization. But in some odd, inexplicable way, it works in this case. Maybe it's because the time travel aspect is almost always an interesting plot device. Maybe it's because the characters and visuals are at times very funny. Or maybe it's a matter of being in the mood for this kind of film. I'm just not sure.Twelve-year-old science wiz Lewis (Daniel Hansen) is hoping to get adopted; as an infant, he was abandoned on the doorstep of an orphanage, left with no one to look after him other than Mildred (Angela Bassett), the kindly orphanage director. After over 100 failed interviews with potential parents, Lewis is beginning to give up hope. Part of the problem is that he tries to impress these couples by demonstrating his latest inventions. All go badly (we see him trying to work a supposedly hassle-free contraption that makes peanut butter and jelly sandwiches). He then decides to find his mother; the one person he feels will truly want him. It doesn't matter that no one knows who this woman is or what she looks like; Lewis saw her as an infant, and he's convinced that he can make that long dormant memory resurface.He spends days building his memory device, much to the chagrin of his roommate, the petite baseball lover Michael ""Goob"" Yagoobian (Matthew Josten). He enters this device in a school science fair, not for the prestige, but for validation, as if to say his genius is all that matters. He does attract the attention of Wilbur (Wesley Singerman), a young teenager claiming to be from the future. He also claims that a man wearing a bowler hat is after Lewis. It takes a lot to convince Lewis of all this, namely the failure of his experiment, the damaging of the school gym, and the discovery of Wilbur's hovercraft (suspended in mid air, hidden by a cloaking device).Thus begins Lewis' journey in the future. This part of the film relies on an intentional manipulation of the science fiction genre, harkening back to the pulp magazines of the 1920s and `30s. Back then, emphasis wasn't placed on plausible scientific possibilities; writers freely used their imaginations when it came to futuristic technologies, distant worlds, and alien races. The results were outlandish, but they were also amazing, so much so that the reader was usually incapable of criticizing anything unrealistic. ""Meet the Robinsons"" works in a similar way; when Lewis and Wilbur first arrive, the audience immediately understands that a realistic future doesn't come into play. Buildings are literally constructed in a matter of seconds; the resulting structures are tall and usually shaped like right triangles with rounded corners. ""Jestons""-like vehicles float through the air, as do people (when contained within a massive soap bubble, that is). Long, twisty tubes snake over, around, and between structures. Such visuals are enhanced through sound, combining cartoonish whizzes, wirps, and boings with music by Danny Elfman.Unbeknownst to Lewis, Wilbur brought him to the future in order to repair an alteration in the space-time continuum. Why Lewis needs to be involved at all, I dare not reveal; let's just say that he's a very important person. I will reveal that Wilbur was right about the man in the bowler hat (Stephen J. Anderson); he's a menacing Snidley Whiplash wannabe, with a long black cloak, a greasy mustache, and crooked, yellow teeth. He travels to the past with a robotic hat named Doris, hoping to steal Lewis' memory contraption and pass it off as his own. While he succeeds in obtaining the device, he has no idea how to work it. His only chance is to return to the future and kidnap Lewis. But that won't be so easy; attempts at using hypnotized animals all fail (a miniature, mind-controlling bowler hat attaches itself to both a frog and a T-Rex). Exactly why is he targeting Lewis? This is something else I will not reveal.Such films are both fun and frustrating; while I enjoyed ""Meet the Robinsons"" as a whole, I was bothered by the over reliance on funnier material. This isn't to say that the film isn't funny; truth be told, parts of it will get some decent laughs. I just would have preferred something a bit more restrained, something that wasn't completely codependent on its sense of humor. Consider Dr. Krunklehorn (Laurie Metcalf), a judge at the school science fair; she kept herself awake for eight days with caffeine patches, and as you might expect, she's more than a little hyperactive. Moments like this would appeal more to children, who don't care about unnecessary characters. As an adult, I appreciated the subtle nods to the Disney franchise, such as a wide shot of a very Space Mountain-esque building (sitting behind a sign reading ""Todayland""). I also appreciated the imaginative settings, the basic story, and the bright color scheme. For this, I'll give ""Meet the Robinsons"" four stars; while it isn't the most appealing Disney film, it's still an enjoyable experience.",4,Ahead of Their Time,1175212800,"03 30,

Morgan ""morganica""","[8, 16]","The original Disney animators tempered saccharine-sweet with a sheen of nastiness, as anyone who's seen early Disney features (Sleeping Beauty, Cinderella, Snow White) can attest. Somewhere along the way, though, Disney dumped the nasty, decided that kids were too innocently dumb to understand ""real"" plots or evil (five minutes of listening to kids playing wargames would have cured them of that notion), and started producing plotless, oversugared confections that didn't enthrall anyone. And, to nobody's surprise, they lost out to more imaginative animations such as ""The Secret of Nimh.""In recent years (and with recent acquisitions) I thought they'd overcome that handicap, but it rears its yawning head in ""Meet the Robinsons."" When the best you can say about an animated feature is ""heartwarming,"" you know you've got a problem. The plot is a simple twist on the old sci-fi time-traveller-meets-himself story: Poor orphan is kidnapped to the future and sees the life he can have if he only ""keeps moving forward."" That's pretty much it.The rest is filled in with a to-do list of kidstuff. ""Hey, kids like dinosaurs! Let's have a dinosaur!"" ""Oooh, yeah! Kids like gross stuff. Let's have them come out of a toilet!"" ""How about a smiley-face robot (a Disney staple)?"" ""Let's name the future city after a Disney theme park, only instead of ""TomorrowLand,"" we'll call it ""TodayLand!"" They did turn the ever-present cute device (this time a bowler hat with presciently creepy spider legs) into the bad guy this time--that's one point in their favor.The characters in the Robinson family are drawn from a wonderfully illustrated book ""A Day with the Robinsons,"" and I see the difficulty in turning that into a story. However, there are so many missed opportunities here that I was mostly frustrated throughout the film.Bottom line, though: I watched this with a group of kids aged 5 through 14. By the middle of the movie most were doing something else and this DVD had turned into background noise. When this same group watched Shrek I and II, Monsters Inc., Ice Age I and II, etc... a nuclear explosion wouldn't have torn them away from the screen.That's the most reliable indicator I know.

That's what I always thought the target audience was in animated films.  Well, in the end, I have nothing but praise for this film, too, because it had some touching qualities to it that would emotionally involve a person of any age.The film - when viewed on Blu-Ray - which I did on the second viewing, was great all the way through and looks fantastic.  Animation seems to be the best venue when it comes high-definition DVDs.The story turned out to be - at least for me as an adult - a really nice film with a heartfelt message of friendship, family and a sense of belonging. At the same time, it still had enough jokes, charm and colorful animation to make it interesting all the way.The film goes from so-so kid stuff to very good as soon as our hero ""Lewis"" and his new friend ""Wilbur"" go into the latter's world: the future. The most amusing segments of the film revolve around the Robinson family, an eccentric but extremely loving group. That family makes this film tick and, hopefully, we'll see more of them in some future feature-length film. These guys - The Robinsons - are just too entertaining to have their movie ""careers"" end with only this one film.The story brings out a very thought-provoking theme to ponder. How would you react if, as a 12-year-old boy, you could meet yourself as an adult perhaps 25 years later....and vice-versa?

I meant to see this movie in the theater but never made the time to; watching the DVD was my first opportunity. I enjoyed the movie; it was a cute tale of a boy in an orphanage who has a deep desire to find his mom, the only person he believes would want him. He's a little braniac who loves to invent things, and turns off each prospective adoptive parent (over 100 have ""interviewed"" him and turned him down). Through a quick series of events, he is thrust into the future and meets the Robinsons, any kid's idea of a wacky and fun family. Lewis and the Robinson's bond immediately until they discover he is from the past. You'll have to watch the movie for the rest of the story. I was not on the edge of my seat with enjoyment like I was with ""The Incredibles"" or ""Ratatouille."" At the end of watching this, I had the same feeling I did from watching ""Cars."" A really enjoyable film but I wouldn't rush right out to see it again. On the plus side, the characters are fantastic; animators have done a great job with Lewis and especially Booger; rather than being 3D animation shells, you really do get a sense of their sadness, happiness, and wonder. Truly amazing. The villain of the movie, Bowler Hat Man, is extremely original; even though a villain, his characterization and portrayal by the animators keeps you from despising him 100% (don't want to give the plot away so that's all I'll say). The 5.1 sound on the DVD rocks - make sure your subwoofer is on and that you are right in the center to take advantage of it. In addition, the animation is great too; so many thing to take notice of and a few inside jokes sprinkled throughout. The extras are enjoyable; the Making of Feature was divided into the usual sections (voices, music, etc.). I had never heard of the book it was based on, so it was interesting to see how it was adapted and learn about the author's intentions in writing it. The deleted scenes are only a handful, and the explanations totally make sense of why they were removed. A few enjoyable music videos, previews, and of course the obligatory game which is pretty fun. This DVD is definitely kid-friendly and would probably be really enjoyable especially for the age group that Lewis is (12), as they could relate to the struggles that he is going through.",4,AN ACTUAL REVIEW OF THE DVD!,1191974400,"10 10, 2007",2007,2410,"['other', '40', 'reviews', 'here', 'one', 'actual', 'review', 'what', 'are', 'thinking', 'purchasing', 'DVD', 'meant', 'see', 'movie', 'theater', 'never', 'made', 'time', 'watching', 'DVD', 'was', 'first', 'opportunity', 'enjoyed', 'movie', 'was', 'cute', 'tale', 'boy', 'orphanage', 'who', 'deep', 'desire', 'find', 'mom', 'only', 'person', 'would', 'want', 'little', 'braniac', 'who', 'invent', 'things', 'off', 'prospective', 'adoptive', 'parent', '100', 'have', 'interviewed', 'turned', 'down', 'quick', 'series', 'events', 'thrust', 'future', 'Robinsons', 'kid', 'idea', 'wacky', 'fun', 'family', 'Lewis', 'Robinson', 'bond', 'immediately', 'discover', 'past', ""'ll"", 'have', 'watch', 'movie', 'rest', 'story', 'was', 'not', 'edge', 'seat', 'enjoyment', 'was', 'Incredibles', 'Ratatouille', 'end', 'watching', 'had', 'same', 'feeling', 'did', 'watching', 'Cars', 'really', 'enjoyable', 'film', 'would', ""n't"", 'rush', 'right', 'out', 'see', 'again', 'plus', 'side', 'characters', 'are', 'fantastic', 'animators', 'have', 'done', 'great', 'job', 'Lewis', 'especially', 'Booger', 'rather', 'being', '3D', 'animation', 'shells', 'really', 'do', 'get', 'sense', 'sadness', 'happiness', 'wonder', 'Truly', 'amazing', 'villain', 'movie', 'Bowler', 'Hat', 'Man', 'extremely', 'original', 'even', 'villain', 'characterization', 'portrayal', 'animators', 'keeps', 'despising', '100', '%', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'give', 'plot', 'away', ""'ll"", 'say', '5.1', 'sound', 'DVD', 'make', 'sure', 'subwoofer', 'are', 'right', 'center', 'take', 'advantage', 'addition', 'animation', 'great', 'too', 'so', 'many', 'thing', 'take', 'notice', 'few', 'inside', 'jokes', 'sprinkled', 'extras', 'are', 'enjoyable', 'Making', 'Feature', 'was', 'divided', 'usual', 'sections', 'voices', 'music', 'etc.', 'had', 'never', 'heard', 'book', 'was', 'based', 'was', 'interesting', 'see', 'how', 'was', 'adapted', 'learn', 'author', 'intentions', 'writing', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'are', 'only', 'handful', 'explanations', 'totally', 'make', 'sense', 'why', 'were', 'removed', 'few', 'enjoyable', 'music', 'videos', 'previews', 'course', 'obligatory', 'game', 'pretty', 'fun', 'DVD', 'definitely', 'kid-friendly', 'would', 'probably', 'be', 'really', 'enjoyable', 'especially', 'age', 'group', 'Lewis', '12', 'could', 'relate', 'struggles', 'going']",N/A
1083373,AIMGHPI1AGVRF,B000ROAK2W,Davewise,"[0, 0]","If you're looking for a funny animated film which is a little off-the-wall, ""Meet the Robinsons"" should satisfy. I would say it is more of a family-oriented movie with simple messages kids of any age can learn. While I didn't find it as fulfilling as recent films like ""Wall-E"" or ""Up"", it was still rather entertaining in its own way.Lewis is a 12 year-old orphan who loves science and tries to invent things, though not always successfully. After over a hundred unsuccessful adoption interviews, he decides to invent something which can display a person's memories on a TV screen so that he would be able to see his mother who abandoned him years ago. Perhaps she gave him up originally because she couldn't care for him and is now ready to do so. Lewis is desperate to find a loving family to be his own.Taking the device to a science fair, Lewis encounters Wilbur Robinson, a 13 year old boy from the future. Wilbur has come to protect Lewis from an evil guy wearing a bowler hat. He isn't successful. The evil man - whose bowler hat seems to have a mind of its own and is smarter than its wearer - sabotages and then steals Lewis' invention. Soon Lewis ends up in the future with Wilbur via a time machine which is then quickly damaged. Wilbur says it's up to Lewis to fix the machine, but Lewis feels defeated after so many failed experiments.While in the future, Lewis accidentally encounters Wilbur's odd extended family. The grandfather leads him around, showing him a variety of sights including the woman with a singing band of frogs with a Sinatra-type lead, an almost-superhero who actually delivers pizzas in a spacecraft, and the twins who hide near the front door asking people to ring their doorbell. Lewis quickly feels at home with the odd bunch, a feeling that only increases after they protect him from the bowler hat guy who arrives in his own stolen time machine to take Lewis away. In the end there is still the question of Lewis possibly discovering who his real mother was.The storyline is somewhat simple which makes it good for all ages. All the time Wilbur is trying to encourage Lewis to believe in himself and to ""keep moving forward"" and learn from mistakes instead of getting down. It's a good simple message for everyone and the goofball characters provide it in a rather entertaining fashion.",4,Fun and zany family comedy,1275868800,"06 7, 2010",2010,2327,"[""'re"", 'looking', 'funny', 'animated', 'film', 'little', 'off-the-wall', 'Meet', 'Robinsons', 'should', 'satisfy', 'would', 'say', 'more', 'family-oriented', 'movie', 'simple', 'messages', 'kids', 'age', 'can', 'learn', 'did', ""n't"", 'find', 'as', 'fulfilling', 'recent', 'films', 'Wall-E', 'was', 'still', 'rather', 'entertaining', 'own', 'way.Lewis', '12', 'year-old', 'orphan', 'who', 'science', 'tries', 'invent', 'things', 'not', 'always', 'successfully', 'hundred', 'unsuccessful', 'adoption', 'interviews', 'invent', 'something', 'can', 'display', 'person', 'memories', 'TV', 'screen', 'so', 'would', 'be', 'able', 'see', 'mother', 'who', 'abandoned', 'years', 'ago', 'Perhaps', 'gave', 'up', 'originally', 'could', ""n't"", 'care', 'now', 'ready', 'do', 'so', 'Lewis', 'desperate', 'find', 'loving', 'family', 'be', 'own.Taking', 'device', 'science', 'fair', 'Lewis', 'Wilbur', 'Robinson', '13', 'year', 'old', 'boy', 'future', 'Wilbur', 'come', 'protect', 'Lewis', 'evil', 'guy', 'wearing', 'bowler', 'hat', ""n't"", 'successful', 'evil', 'man', 'bowler', 'hat', 'have', 'mind', 'own', 'smarter', 'wearer', 'sabotages', 'then', 'steals', 'Lewis', 'invention', 'Soon', 'Lewis', 'up', 'future', 'Wilbur', 'time', 'machine', 'then', 'quickly', 'damaged', 'Wilbur', 'up', 'Lewis', 'fix', 'machine', 'Lewis', 'feels', 'defeated', 'so', 'many', 'failed', 'experiments.While', 'future', 'Lewis', 'accidentally', 'Wilbur', 'odd', 'extended', 'family', 'grandfather', 'around', 'showing', 'variety', 'sights', 'including', 'woman', 'singing', 'band', 'frogs', 'Sinatra-type', 'lead', 'almost-superhero', 'who', 'actually', 'pizzas', 'spacecraft', 'twins', 'who', 'hide', 'front', 'door', 'asking', 'people', 'ring', 'doorbell', 'Lewis', 'quickly', 'home', 'odd', 'bunch', 'feeling', 'only', 'increases', 'protect', 'bowler', 'hat', 'guy', 'who', 'own', 'stolen', 'time', 'machine', 'take', 'Lewis', 'away', 'end', 'still', 'question', 'Lewis', 'possibly', 'discovering', 'who', 'real', 'mother', 'was.The', 'storyline', 'somewhat', 'simple', 'good', 'ages', 'time', 'Wilbur', 'trying', 'encourage', 'Lewis', 'believe', 'keep', 'moving', 'forward', 'learn', 'mistakes', 'instead', 'getting', 'down', 'good', 'simple', 'message', 'everyone', 'goofball', 'characters', 'provide', 'rather', 'entertaining', 'fashion']",N/A

Once again they tried to score for the magic of Pixar, but they missed the one thing that seperates Pixar from the rest: great filmmaking. The main character of the film is yet again another Hollywood orphan that the creators don't develope and expect you to pity simply because he's got no family, saw the same character 50 years ago in Oliver and have seen probably 30 times since, NEXT! the Robinson's, the fantastic family that the main character meets in his adventure is totally underdeveloped. Each family member speaks an average of 3 lines and you're supposed to know them and care for them, in fact, the main character accidentally calls Mrs. Robinson 'mom' within 15 minutes of knowing her, because he apparently feels some strong connection to the family, oh please. The movie also attempts at a twist ending, and fails horribly, I had figured it out within the first 20 minutes of the movie! (possible spoiler) The ending is also a rip of another movie, at the end of this film the world has been taken over by bowler hats.

First and most important of all, John Lasseter took over the studio after Disney bought Pixar. This change was and still is very welcoming because in the past decade Disney Animation Studios struggle to create new good films and most of them like Home on the Range and Chicken Little were awful, this was sad because Disney had been the best for so many years and became one of the worst. But, thanks to Lasseter, Disney Animation Studios found a new identity and beginning with this film, Disney Animation empowered itself and now is back on the right track. So far all the films that has been released under the Lasseter era (Meet the Robinsons, Bolt, The Princess and the Frog, Tangled and Winnie the Pooh) have delivered great quality entertainment.I must be honest, when I heard about Meet the Robinsons back in 2007, I was not thrilled. Following the horrible Chicken Little was not a good prospect at all, but when I saw it in theaters, I was very satisfied with the results.Meet the Robinsons is the story of Lewis an orphan genius boy who wants to be adopted. He goes to a fair with an invent and that leads to a series of events that end up with him in the future with the Robinson family. The film is great with fun characters and interesting twists. The story may be a little confusing for little ones and there are many characters that you won't remember, but overall Meet the Robinsons is a nice family film with great values and a fun story.Video & AudioMeet the Robinsons looks spectacular on BD. There is no other way to put it, the film is completely inmaculate, there are no signs of compression or any other anomaly. A pristine transfer through and through.The 5.1 Uncompressed audio is also great with every sound being strong and dialogue is crystal clear.Bonus FeaturesThere are not a lot of bonus material but some of the things are interesting to watch:The most interesting feature is a featurette called ""Inventing the Robinsons"", a making of documentary dealing with the production of the film.You also have an audiocommentary with the director that's very informative.Then you have ""Inventions that shaped the World"" which deals with some of the inventions and inventors of the past century.You also have deleted scenes and two music videos.A DVD copy is also included.Closing ThoughtsMeet the Robinsons may not be an instant classic as other Disney films but it's a pretty good movie with an interesting story, fun characters and great values about family, confidence and more. This BD set offers spectacular video & audio and a nice assortment of bonus features.

1083382,ATS7EORYPRZB6,B000ROAK2W,EliOskar,"[2, 2]","Ever since the Disney Renaissance, Disney had been spitting out some crappy films. You do have your exceptions such as 'The Emperor's New Groove', and 'Lilo and Stitch'. When 'Meet the Robinsons' came out, I am sure many Disney fans thought it would be another terrible film to add to the New Disney rubbish heap. However, as someone who thought the film would be terrible too, I'm happy to say that this  film was the beginning of Disney's new age of magic.Synopsis: Lewis, a young inventor, wants to be adopted, but his wild, never-working inventions keep potential families away. Then he meets Wilbur Robinson, an odd kid who takes him to a journey into the future he will never forget.Let's start with the good: The humor in the film is fantastic. You don't have the fart jokes or other inappropriate jokes that plague most modern children movies, so that's a huge relief. Instead, the humor is actually quite witty.The characters are so wonderfully odd and imaginative that they keep your attention and enjoying their wild oddities.The villain, though he can be scary at times, is very funny and very goofy as well. He was a joy to watch, and who he actually was is a great plot twist. In fact, there were many great plot twists that may or may not surprise you.Although I would've preferred the film be hand-drawn, the CG was still great. It actually works for the film because of its story. Being one of the earliest CG endeavors for Disney, it doesn't reach the greatness in animation as its recent 'Tangled', however, the animation is still pretty great. Colors are vibrant, buildings beautifully imagined, and in blu ray it looks pristine.The film has a great message, as any good Disney film. The message is great for the little ones as for the older ones. Taken from a Walt Disney Quote, the film's motto ""Keep Moving Forward"" almost mirrors what Disney is doing after a second, short Dark Age. Disney is moving forward, trying to bring us better quality films. And they have been ever since 'Meet the Robinsons'.Now the bad: Although the Robinson family is very interesting, and teach children that failures are good because you can learn from them (that's great), they seem too nice, but I won't blame it on bad character writing. No, I think that that is how all the humans were portrayed in the future. Even as Lewis first entered the future with Wilbur, the people that he passed waved at him or smiled. These people are so much kinder than my own family! So this could be bad or good depending on your own beliefs. Personally, I just think that's how the future people are in the film. The reason I put it under bad is because you, the buyer, may not like oddly nice people.The film, sadly, only devotes a short time for the audience to learn more about the family. Although it is comical and fun how it is done, I would've liked to have more time devoted to explore them.Like most modern Disney animated features, the film is devoid of characters singing. I can understand if you think I'm being nitpicky now ( I am ), but I would have loved to see singing; that's what I loved so much about Disney films--the music. Although Danny Elfman's score was great, as usual, I still would've liked the characters to have songs to sing. Imagine the possibilities! Mrs. Robinson could have sung a song about her frogs, or her husbad's motto: ""Keep Moving Forward"". Wilbur could have sung a song about the wonders of the future as Lewis watched these wonders. The Bowler Hat Guy could've sung his motifs in song, or sung a revenge song. It's endless what songs could have been. Maybe you, the buyer, don't like singing animated films; well then this film is perfect for you. It's still a good movie, but I would've liked that.'Meet the Robinsons' is a wonderful surprise and a good addition to your Disney library.

I don't think there's an animated Disney film that I've given less than a 10 out of 10.  Heck, I give a large percentage of their live action fare a 10 out of 10, and almost never give any of their films lower than a 7 out of 10.  I don't do this just because they're Disney and I'm issuing a vote to keep me in an extended, fantastical childhood (I need no assistance in maintaining an element of that, thank you); I do it because I really enjoy their work that much.It's easy to see how many people might not care for Meet the Robinsons.  It has far more in common stylistically with recent Disney films like Chicken Little (2005) and Lilo & Stitch (2002) than it does with the ""classic"" Disney films (Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs (1937), Cinderella (1950), etc.), or even their ""second golden age"" (The Lion King (1994), Beauty and the Beast (1991), etc.)--although it's worthwhile to note that some characteristics are not that far removed from Alice in Wonderland (1951) or even Pinocchio (1940), and you'll find things reminiscent of many other films--from Toy Story (1995) to Robots (2005) to Looney Tunes cartoons.  It has an unusual, surrealistic flow, and it often seems like there's nowhere the animators won't go for a bit of weirdness.But especially this latter fact is part of the charm to me.  Meet the Robinsons may be adapted from the gorgeously drawn children's book, William Joyce's A Day with Wilbur Robinson (1993), but it seems just as inspired by Edward Lear's ""Nonsense"" books, which were some of my first favorites as a kid.Visually, Meet the Robinsons is just as beautiful as Joyce's work.

1083388,AHB0L35LOICAN,B000ROAK2W,"GB Banks (publisher, author) "", author""","[6, 10]","I'm a long time fan of the Disney movies, especially their 3D animated flicks by Pixar. Although I've seen almost all of these films, when ""Meet the Robinsons"" first premiered, I found myself not feeling overly compelled to see it. I'm not sure why, except that on the surface of the promotion it didn't seem to possess the same sense of magic and wonder that other films like ""Cars"" or ""Toy Story"" generated, so I never made an effort to see the movie until it premiered on cable a couple of weeks ago. And I am happy to say that the movie was a happy surprise.What fascinates me about Pixar/Disney films is their ability to breathe such vivid life into animated characters, to create stories that are both heartfelt and compelling, and the way they seem to never lose touch with what's it's like to see things through the eyes of a child. When you watch the story of Lewis, an orphan with a brilliant mind who is desperate to find a place where he belongs, you don't see this as an animated tale, but the story of a real little boy. A few of the scenes, in particular the one's depicting newborn Lewis being left on the doorstep of an orphanage by his mother, contain the kind of elegant and sincere cinematography as a classic film of the 40s or 50s. In these scenes, the animated characters possess the same on-screen presence as real actors.If the film lacks anything, it's consistency. While I love the movie for what it is, and I love all the elements of it overall, as a cohesive story, the movie does bounce back and forth from touching drama to flat out slapstick humor. While other Disney/Pixar films seem to have a natural ebb and flow that maintains a strong balance between the comedic and dramatic turns in their plots, this one feels just a bit disjointed to me. Perhaps if the villain, the ""Bowler Hat Guy,"" hadn't been so over-the-top bumbling criminal, or if the Robinson clan hadn't seemed like a futuristic Addam's family who all needed to be institutionalized for their own protection, I wouldn't have come away with the nagging thought in the back of my mind that while I enjoyed the movie a lot, there was something missing that could have made it even better.But I still found ""Meet the Robinsons"" one of the better family films around, and there are definitely enough laughs to keep your kids happy, and if you are like me an adult that still has some lingering connection with your inner child, you will find enough fun moments to keep you entertained as well.- Gregory Bernard Banks, author, reader, reviewer",4,"""Meet the Robinsons"" - Another Disney Treat",1210809600,"05 15, 2008",2008,2536,"[""'m"", 'long', 'time', 'fan', 'Disney', 'movies', 'especially', '3D', 'animated', 'flicks', 'Pixar', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'almost', 'films', 'when', 'Meet', 'Robinsons', 'first', 'premiered', 'found', 'not', 'feeling', 'overly', 'compelled', 'see', ""'m"", 'not', 'sure', 'why', 'surface', 'promotion', 'did', ""n't"", 'seem', 'possess', 'same', 'sense', 'magic', 'wonder', 'other', 'films', 'Cars', 'Toy', 'Story', 'generated', 'never', 'made', 'effort', 'see', 'movie', 'premiered', 'cable', 'couple', 'weeks', 'ago', 'am', 'happy', 'say', 'movie', 'was', 'happy', 'surprise.What', 'Pixar/Disney', 'films', 'ability', 'breathe', 'such', 'vivid', 'life', 'animated', 'characters', 'create', 'stories', 'are', 'heartfelt', 'compelling', 'way', 'seem', 'never', 'lose', 'touch', 'what', 'see', 'things', 'eyes', 'child', 'When', 'watch', 'story', 'Lewis', 'orphan', 'brilliant', 'mind', 'who', 'desperate', 'find', 'place', 'where', 'do', ""n't"", 'see', 'animated', 'tale', 'story', 'real', 'little', 'boy', 'few', 'scenes', 'particular', 'one', 'depicting', 'newborn', 'Lewis', 'being', 'left', 'doorstep', 'orphanage', 'mother', 'contain', 'kind', 'elegant', 'sincere', 'cinematography', 'classic', 'film', '40s', '50s', 'scenes', 'animated', 'characters', 'possess', 'same', 'on-screen', 'presence', 'real', 'film', 'anything', 'consistency', 'love', 'movie', 'what', 'love', 'elements', 'overall', 'cohesive', 'story', 'movie', 'bounce', 'back', 'forth', 'touching', 'drama', 'flat', 'out', 'slapstick', 'humor', 'other', 'Disney/Pixar', 'films', 'seem', 'have', 'natural', 'ebb', 'flow', 'strong', 'balance', 'comedic', 'dramatic', 'turns', 'plots', 'one', 'just', 'bit', 'disjointed', 'Perhaps', 'villain', 'Bowler', 'Hat', 'Guy', 'had', ""n't"", 'been', 'so', 'over-the-top', 'bumbling', 'criminal', 'Robinson', 'clan', 'had', ""n't"", 'seemed', 'futuristic', 'Addam', 'family', 'who', 'needed', 'be', 'institutionalized', 'own', 'protection', 'would', ""n't"", 'have', 'come', 'away', 'nagging', 'thought', 'back', 'mind', 'enjoyed', 'movie', 'lot', 'was', 'something', 'missing', 'could', 'have', 'made', 'even', 'better.But', 'still', 'found', 'Meet', 'Robinsons', 'one', 'better', 'family', 'films', 'are', 'definitely', 'enough', 'laughs', 'keep', 'kids', 'happy', 'are', 'adult', 'still', 'lingering', 'connection', 'inner', 'child', 'will', 'find', 'enough', 'fun', 'moments', 'keep', 'entertained', 'well.-', 'Gregory', 'Bernard', 'Banks', 'author', 'reader', 'reviewer']",N/A

Maybe it was a slew of spectacular films playing on screens 2 through 75.  Doubtful.  Maybe it was a sudden, urgent need to be more intellectual and read worldly literature.  -HCK-  Sorry, milk just came out my nose.  No, if I put real thought in it, I may have been scared off by the typical onslaught of press awarded any Disney release.  Not any particular movie review but rather, the motivations behind much of the press.  Months before a movie release, parties on both sides lay the groundwork for their pre-determined position on any film.  And like the political faithful who only point out problems with the opposing candidate, their stance is loud and assertive, even before seeing the film.  It seems there is an anti-success bias going on in the world for the past 20 years or so, and Disney, like Microsoft and Wal-Mart is a constant target to attacks...  -Woah- I'm way off track here... Let me start again.I did not see Meet the Robinson's on its theatrical release.  You see, while on the way to the multiplex I was attacked by a bear.So now, several months after its theatrical release, it appears on DVD.  I took it in and found it a sturdy project although the pacing made it impossible to achieve its potential emotional bang.This is a story of Lewis, an orphan who looks for solace from his lot in life through invention.  Through a myriad of circumstances, Lewis finds himself traveling 30 years into the future where he meets an eccentric and extreme family of the future - the Robinsons.  Things quickly deteriorate because of his earlier actions.  He must return back to the past to make things right.  Standing in his way is Bowler Hat guy, a nefarious villain with the look of a silent movie baddy and the planning skills of an omelet.  And in the end, it all ties in with the broken life of his orphanage roommate, Goob, who seeks solace from his lot in life through baseball.Lewis' journey may be hectic, but his emotional journey is clear and touching.  In there lies the films biggest problem.The slam bang spray of hit-n-miss gags kept my mind pretty busy.  I never had time to feel desperate for Lewis, especially with a bumbling villain as his only nemesis.Disney's art design here is very good, but not far enough removed from earlier Computer-animated films like Jimmy Neutron - something that Pixar's Ratatouille did well.  The view of the future was fun and informative while remained positive for the most part.While Imagineering this story, they happened upon a story concept used in Walt Disney's first feature film, Snow White.  In both stories, the hero/heroine teams up with a large clan of extreme characters who do their best at offering protection.  While anyone in the Robinson family are not as iconic as any of the seven dwarfs, they are broadly drawn and humorous.  Broadly drawn and humorous may have been the studio mantra behind Meet the Robinsons.  A quickly moving story that may jive well with today's fast edit sensibilities.The video quality on the DVD is gorgeous.  I'm sure it is even more spectacular on Blu-Ray for those of you who have decided to take that plunge.  The film offers a nice audio commentary and an informative behind the scenes document.

1083392,A3QAQUUPFIARWB,B000ROAK2W,"Gord Wilson ""alivingdog.com""","[0, 0]","Having just seen Wall-E, I looked in vain for Pixar in the credits on this film. John Lasseter's name is on it, but other than that, no sign of Luxo Jr., the little hopping Pixar lamp. This is a bit of an odd duck film because it missed its curtain time, unveiling late, and slipped under the radar. That said, the story line is as complex and developed as Wall-E, the film is so good I wished it were longer, and the DVD is graced with compelling extras.You can read the story anywhere, but the book it came from is by William Joyce, also the creative pen behind Playtime Disney's Rolie Polie Olie (sp.). The Robinson look is very different than that, but it's got the same mixing of traditional retro design with imaginative take-offs. Wilbur Robinson just about steals the show, and the voice acting reminds me of another quality animated sleeper, Titan A.E.. Titan was the Bluth studio's swan song, and failed, as did Warner's The Iron Giant, merely because only Disney can market animation. That said, Disney almost couldn't, or didn't market Meet the Robinsons (despite the fact that the space/ time travel ship and the city would make great toys, and it's not like Disney to miss a licensing opportunity.The extras really make the DVD. The best is the intervew with the director. The music is varied and strong enough to make the soundtrack stand on its own. There's also a history of inventions featurette that has the feel of '50s documentaries of Disneyland. It's got the same mix of science fact and speculation as earlier non-fiction segments that ran on the Disney TV shows, for instance the three space programs on the Tommorowland Disney Treasures set (which spurred our own space program). The last of the three is the best animated, but perpetuates the myth that Medievals thought the world was flat. This invention featurette admits that Galileo didn't invent the telescope, but otherwise plays fast and loose, giving Edison credit for inventing the light bulb, Philo T. Farnsworth the T.V., Bell the telephone, etc. In most cases, these men were perfecting ideas that many inventors were working on. In Edison's case, although he was a tireless inventor, he often stole his employees' and associates' ideas, particularly those of Nikola Tesla and Steinmetz (the brains behind General Electric).All that is generally known, but it would be nice to have a bit more homework behind the Disney version. That said, in the realm of imagination the big D is unsurpassed. The video game looks quite good, and I'm all ready for the Robinson ride. The Robinsonian motto ""Keep Moving Forward"" even comes from Walt himself, as two quotes at the close of the film make clear. In this regard the film's motto recalls the song in Chitty Chitty Bang Bang: ""From the ashes of disaster grow the roses of success"".Dexter's Laboratory likely sparked the current interest in whiz kid protagonists, but it's nice to see so much wit, enthusiasm, and,  I think I can say, love put into a family film.

It's well worth discovering. The movie trailers really couldn't do it justice, because the story is much more than a wacky adventure. It has a lot of heart and, as you can discover from the supplemental materials, it is a very personal story from its director, Stephen Anderson.Meet the Robinsons is based on A Day With Wilbur Robinson by William Joyce, who also was responsible for the quirky yet lovable Roly Poly Olie series for Playhouse Disney. Visually you'll spot some similarities but on a much larger scale.In a sea of animated features that exploit ""sure-fire"" celebrity voices and ""short-cut"" pop tunes, Meet the Robinsons uses a cast of less recognizable name talent (with one major exception which is discussed on the commentary) and songs that are largely created for the film, not by flash in the pan pop tarts, but by unique performers like Rufus Wainwright, Jamie Cullum and Rob Thomas (see my CD review for more info).It is precisely this less typical approach that makes the film achieve its singular vision, a rarity these days. Even though the plot is serpentine, it never really veers from the theme of belonging and ""moving forward."" Reportedly, many interfering hands tried to mess with the film before John Lassiter told Anderson to follow his own vision. Unheard of in this day and age of multi-meddling!The DVD features a great commentary by Anderson, who really tries hard to give others credit (also a rarity). A genuinely funny side feature of the commentary is the ""break-ins"" by Bowler Hat Guy, who tries to do his own ridiculous commentary (and is also voiced by Anderson). There are lots of interesting tidbits revealed, including how they used two young actors to play Lewis because the first actor's voice changed.Anderson also introduces deleted scenes and appears in a nice ""making of"" section. Also nice is that Walt Disney is rightly acknowledged, both in the final quote of the film, and in the ""Inventions That Shaped the World"" feature.

1083396,A2HVL790PBWYTU,B000ROAK2W,"H. Bala ""Me Too Can Read""","[2, 3]","Inspired by William Joyce's children's bookA Day with Wilbur Robinson, Disney Pictures does us a good deed with its release of MEET THE ROBINSONS. Me, I'm a little jaded by the frequency of animated feature films clamoring for the viewers' attention, so I waited on this one until the dvd came out. Turns out this is a pretty nifty animated flick, good for all ages. The central plot and themes of the story certainly aren't new, concerning a lonely 12-year-old prodigy named Lewis living in an orphanage who longs for a family. But after 124 disastrous adoption interviews Lewis is starting to think it might not happen for him.His fondest wish is to glimpse the face of his mom, who abandoned him on the steps of the orphanage when he was a baby. He believes that if he can just find her, she'll take him back into her life. So first he needs to remember her face. Being a budding inventor, Lewis creates the memory scanner (""Ooooh - it's shiny!"") and presents it at the local science fair. There he meets a strange kid named Wilbur Robinson who then more or less gets him into his time travel aircraft and shanghais him into the future (a future where Canada has become Northern Montana and part of the U.S.).In the future, Wilbur needs a favor from Lewis. Lewis just wants Wilbur to time travel him to the point when his mom left him. But on their heels and with a focused grievance against Lewis is the none too bright but waxy mustachy scalawag, the Bowler Hat Man, and his henchthing Doris the malignant robotic chapeau (who actually might be the brains of this outfit). The Bowler Hat Man is bent on stealing Lewis's memory scanner invention and grabbing credit and glory. Doris? Who knows what she's thinking. She's a hat. But, scarily, the future of humanity just might be at stake before this one's over.To begin with, MEET THE ROBINSONS is an excellent family movie, with humor for one and all and lessons to be learned (or relearned) about the values of family (no matter how eccentric), friendship, looking ahead and letting go, and accepting yourself for who you are. You know, the usual stuff. But stuff still very much worth going over, yes? The visuals in this film are just marvelous and smacks of exuberance and fanciful daydreams. The characters are cartoony looking, yup, but the CG graphics are so well done, the motions of the characters so fluid and natural that the viewer is instantly swayed (well, I was swayed). Too, there's a splendid sense of optimism and wonder conveyed in the Robinsons' future world, which resembles a joyous Lego Wonderland come to life. When the dark, foreboding alternate future is briefly experienced by Lewis, the contrast is startling and even sobering. There's a couple of nice twists as the plot unfolds, which you might or might not see coming. I caught some, missed others.It's an all-star cast having a romp with their madcap characters. Harland Williams is a hoot as Carl the robot. Adam West makes his Uncle Art sound like a superhero even if he's only an intergalactic pizza deliverer. Tom Selleck plays Cornelius Robinson and Angela Bassett is Mildred, the kind lady from the orphanage. But, hands down, the standout voice belongs to the director himself Stephen Anderson, who's just aces as the Bowler Hat Man, whose aspirations far exceed his feeble ability to realize them. Anderson makes the Bowler Hat Man the best character in the film.Of the special features, the ones I really enjoyed are: the audio commentary by Director Stephen Anderson and ""Special Guest"" (see the film first; as the director cautions at the start: plenty of spoilers in the commentary); ""Inventing the Robinsons"" - the Making Of featurette; the educational but fun segment ""Inventions That Shaped the World""; and the three deleted scenes, introduced by Anderson and totalling 7 minutes. Not to mention, I like the goofy dinosaur doing the Running Man on the Menu screen.Singing frogs, a rampaging dinosaur, a daffy robot, twins hanging out at doorbells, a dog sporting spectacles, a monster for a butler, and other peculiar characters. What else? A great over-the-top villain (the Bowler Hat Man will tickle your fancy). A heartfelt score by Danny Elfman. I don't normally mention musical scores, but Danny Elfman just hits it out of the park with his composing, each note seemingly ideal for establishing the intended mood. And, on top of it all, it's a time travel story. This flick sets a quick pace and has a tendency to lay down drive-by comedy, meaning the jokes are quick hits and then you move on. The avalanche of family members had me addled for a while 'til I sorted out who was who. Hopefully, you don't get as bewildered. MEET THE ROBINSONS doesn't quite have the resonance or depth of classic animations such asThe Incredibles (Two-Disc Collector's Edition),Finding Nemo (Two-Disc Collector's Edition), orToy Story (10th Anniversary Edition), but it's still a very solid picture and definitely exceeded my expectations. The kids will definitely have a blast. Meanwhile I'm still debating whether to check out FLUSHED AWAY or SURF'S UP.",4,"""Okay.

Be honest, don't most of the movies you see (animated), follow a same very basic plot.  Even Disney as great as they are has repackaged the princess movie so many times if you've seen one, you've probably seen them all.  It's just with Disney they do it so well, who cares.But with Meet the Robinsons this is not some re-hash of some old idea.  This one actually is orginal, and it's told very well.I really liked this movie.  I didn't come in with high hopes after watching Valient and Chicken Little, but I was surprised and happy to see Disney do a GREAT job telling a new and unique story.The main characters are developed, and your children won't see the twist coming the first time they watch it.  The music is great, especially Rob Thomas.And the Bowler Hat Guy, is so different as the bad-guy I don't think Disney has ever done one like it.  HE kind of reminds me of a male Cruella DeVille.The gags with the hat are funny, especially with the T-rex.This is a good movie, and unfortunately it will join the club of other pretty good movies that Disney has made that have been forgotten, mainly because they don't have that one song that everybody loves, or that one character that everybody thinks is adorable or pathetic, or whatever it is that draws people to some of these characters.I say give it 10 years and nobody will remember this movie.  Not because it was a bad movie, in fact it's a very good movie.  It will be forgotten because I think for whatever reason the masses just aren't interested.  And that's a shame.

This movie teaches us about keep moving forward. if you haven't seen it I truly recommend this one I dare to foresee that your reaction after seeing it most likely will be to go ahead and hug your children while you can or call that now distant relative that for some reason you haven't talk to in some time...I did....both....

What I can tell not only from this movie but real life is that when you adopt somebody (or something like a pet) you save their life and change it forever for the better. This movie have one the most beautiful messages like I said packaged in a kid's movie. if you are able to see beyond the silly kid's entertaining situations you will be able to appreciate the fantastic message about love, compassion and forgiveness. For some reason the last five minutes of this movie always get me looking for paper tissue...a beautiful story about family and fraternal love even if your family is not blood related...it is heart related and that has the same or even more value. when you see this movie you can't help but to think in the life of Steve Jobs an adopted genius that changed the world forever.

This is the best animated film that Disney has put out in a decade (excluding Pixar films).The story is a great one as we witness the tale of an orphan, Louis.  He's a brilliant kid, always working on an invention of some kind.  Time travel high jinks ensue in a movie that is very funny in a quirky way and also very touching.This is a film that reclaims the heart of Disney and has a message that Walt would love: Keep Moving Forward.  The story of a kid finding a family touches on what family truly is while also stressing the importance of not looking backwards and dwelling in the past.  It's a great message for kids and family alike - let go of bitterness and disillusion.  Instead, look to the future and what you can do to make it better.  Like I said Uncle Walt would have loved it.Meet the Robinsons is also unique in its execution of the future and its sense of humor.  There are tons of hilarious things that will keep you laughing over and over again.In addition to the movie, this one has a great soundtrack.  Rufus Wainwright contributes some great tunes but Rob Thomas' ""Little Wonders"" really is a great song about the small hours of our lives.  Danny Elfman's score is fantastic as his pop song, ""The Future Has Arrived"", performed by the All-American Rejects as the credits roll.The Blu-Ray of this movie is beautiful and will pull you in.  Blu-Ray shows how good CGI looks these days and gives a detail not found in standard def.Highly recommended.  Watch it with the kids or not.  The movie has a message that will resonate with the older and is entertaining for the younger ones, though the adults will get the most out of the message.  Still, I'm sure Meet the Robinsons will encourage all viewers to Keep Moving Forward.",5,Disney Reclaims its Heart,1202688000,"02 11, 2008",2008,1974,"['must', 'admit', 'Meet', 'Robinsons', 'did', ""n't"", 'look', 'film', 'would', 'appeal', 'when', 'saw', 'trailers', 'good', 'friend', 'had', 'desire', 'see', 'so', 'went', 'then', 'plopped', 'coin', 'see', '3D', 'only', 'few', 'days', 'later', 'best', 'animated', 'film', 'Disney', 'put', 'out', 'decade', 'excluding', 'Pixar', 'films', '.The', 'story', 'great', 'one', 'witness', 'tale', 'orphan', 'Louis', 'brilliant', 'kid', 'always', 'working', 'invention', 'kind', 'Time', 'travel', 'high', 'jinks', 'ensue', 'movie', 'very', 'funny', 'quirky', 'way', 'also', 'very', 'touching.This', 'film', 'heart', 'Disney', 'message', 'Walt', 'would', 'love', 'Keep', 'Moving', 'Forward', 'story', 'kid', 'finding', 'family', 'what', 'family', 'truly', 'also', 'stressing', 'importance', 'not', 'looking', 'backwards', 'dwelling', 'past', 'great', 'message', 'kids', 'family', 'alike', 'let', 'go', 'bitterness', 'disillusion', 'Instead', 'look', 'future', 'what', 'can', 'do', 'make', 'better', 'said', 'Uncle', 'Walt', 'would', 'have', 'loved', 'it.Meet', 'Robinsons', 'also', 'unique', 'execution', 'future', 'sense', 'humor', 'are', 'tons', 'hilarious', 'things', 'will', 'keep', 'laughing', 'again.In', 'addition', 'movie', 'one', 'great', 'soundtrack', 'Rufus', 'Wainwright', 'great', 'tunes', 'Rob', 'Thomas', 'Little', 'Wonders', 'really', 'great', 'song', 'small', 'hours', 'lives', 'Danny', 'Elfman', 'score', 'fantastic', 'pop', 'song', 'Future', 'Arrived', 'performed', 'All-American', 'Rejects', 'credits', 'roll.The', 'Blu-Ray', 'movie', 'beautiful', 'will', 'pull', 'Blu-Ray', 'how', 'good', 'CGI', 'days', 'detail', 'not', 'found', 'standard', 'def.Highly', 'recommended', 'Watch', 'kids', 'not', 'movie', 'message', 'will', 'resonate', 'older', 'entertaining', 'younger', 'ones', 'adults', 'will', 'get', 'most', 'message', 'Still', ""'m"", 'sure', 'Meet', 'Robinsons', 'will', 'encourage', 'viewers', 'Keep', 'Moving', 'Forward']",N/A

""A New Yorker""","[3, 4]","The 3-D is really stunning and, while it's not revolutionary in what it does in the film - it's the same whoa, it's in my face gags - it is very striking in what it brings out in the animation. The characters are not terribly interesting until you get into the future, and there the film shines. ""Meet the Robinsons"" hits all the emotional and dramatic beats you'd expect from a children's film involving time travel. The usual time travel paradox rears its head just enough to confuse (or potentially confuse) young children, but if anything ""Meet the Robinsons"" makes up for the convoluted storyline with enough eccentric characters and unexpected switchbacks to keep younger children fascinated with the proceedings. Everyone else, though, will easily figure out the major plot twists involving Lewis, Wilbur, Wilbur's family, and even the villainous Bowler Hat Guy.That's not necessarily a bad thing, since ""Meet the Robinsons"" isn't so much about innovative storytelling as it is about imparting positive, family-centric values (none of them even remotely offensive) and a ""success through failure"" theme that's bound to resonate with moviegoers young and old. And if those themes don't work, ""Meet the Robinsons"" name checks Tomorrowland (Todayland in the near future), a once popular Disneyland ride, plus a few movie references to keep cinephiles happy, e.g., 2001: A Space Odyssey (e.g. Doris the Bowler Hat), 1979's The Black Hole, Disney's ill-fated attempt to cash in on the science fiction/adventure trend that began with Star Wars in 1977, and the Matrix trilogy.Ultimately, though, ""Meet the Robinsons"" is all about what we see, what we experience through Lewis' eyes as he journeys into the near future. Luckily for Lewis (and us), the future isn't that different from an idealized version of the future as imagined in the 1950s (i.e., retro-futurism). With an emphasis on curvilinear shapes and a bright color palette (reds and blues dominate), the future in this movie is never less than a treat for the eye. And in Disney Digital 3D(tm), the result is an immersive experience that moviegoers will want to repeat again and again. They just might, especially since ""Meet the Robinsons"" is doing very well at the box office, expect a Disneyland or Disneyworld ride in the not too distant future.",4,Disney has moved forward,1177372800,"04 24, 2007",2007,2311,"['3-D', 'really', 'stunning', 'not', 'revolutionary', 'what', 'film', 'same', 'whoa', 'face', 'gags', 'very', 'striking', 'what', 'out', 'animation', 'characters', 'are', 'not', 'terribly', 'interesting', 'get', 'future', 'there', 'film', 'shines', 'Meet', 'Robinsons', 'emotional', 'dramatic', 'beats', ""'d"", 'expect', 'children', 'film', 'involving', 'time', 'travel', 'usual', 'time', 'travel', 'paradox', 'head', 'just', 'enough', 'confuse', 'potentially', 'confuse', 'young', 'children', 'anything', 'Meet', 'Robinsons', 'up', 'convoluted', 'storyline', 'enough', 'eccentric', 'characters', 'unexpected', 'switchbacks', 'keep', 'younger', 'children', 'fascinated', 'proceedings', 'Everyone', 'else', 'will', 'easily', 'figure', 'out', 'major', 'plot', 'twists', 'involving', 'Lewis', 'Wilbur', 'Wilbur', 'family', 'even', 'villainous', 'Bowler', 'Hat', 'Guy.That', 'not', 'necessarily', 'bad', 'thing', 'Meet', 'Robinsons', ""n't"", 'so', 'much', 'innovative', 'storytelling', 'imparting', 'positive', 'family-centric', 'values', 'none', 'even', 'remotely', 'offensive', 'success', 'failure', 'theme', 'bound', 'resonate', 'moviegoers', 'young', 'old', 'themes', 'do', ""n't"", 'work', 'Meet', 'Robinsons', 'name', 'checks', 'Tomorrowland', 'Todayland', 'near', 'future', 'once', 'popular', 'Disneyland', 'ride', 'few', 'movie', 'references', 'keep', 'cinephiles', 'happy', 'e.g.', '2001', 'Space', 'Odyssey', 'e.g', 'Doris', 'Bowler', 'Hat', '1979', 'Black', 'Hole', 'Disney', 'ill-fated', 'attempt', 'cash', 'science', 'fiction/adventure', 'trend', 'began', 'Star', 'Wars', '1977', 'Matrix', 'trilogy.Ultimately', 'Meet', 'Robinsons', 'what', 'see', 'what', 'experience', 'Lewis', 'eyes', 'near', 'future', 'Luckily', 'Lewis', 'future', ""n't"", 'that', 'different', 'idealized', 'version', 'future', 'imagined', '1950s', 'i.e.', 'retro-futurism', 'emphasis', 'curvilinear', 'shapes', 'bright', 'color', 'palette', 'reds', 'blues', 'dominate', 'future', 'movie', 'never', 'less', 'treat', 'eye', 'Disney', 'Digital', '3D', 'tm', 'result', 'immersive', 'experience', 'moviegoers', 'will', 'want', 'repeat', 'again', 'again', 'just', 'might', 'especially', 'Meet', 'Robinsons', 'doing', 'very', 'well', 'box', 'office', 'expect', 'Disneyland', 'Disneyworld', 'ride', 'not', 'too', 'distant', 'future']",N/A

It's an exercise in history, however, because it's essential to understanding the creative turmoil within the studio at this time.

Each time I sat down to watch it, my three year old needed mommy for something else.  Finally, she, herself, is old enough to enjoy it, so we all sat down together to watch this Disney film.  What fun we had!Disney did a nice job with MEET THE ROBINSONS.  This film is beautifully animated, had a nice, happy story, and puts a smile on the of each member of the family.  With the added bonus of a little cartoon sci-fi and some time-travel, MEET THE ROBINSONS will appeal to almost everyone.In MEET THE ROBINSONS, Lewis is a geeky little 12 year old inventor, who was left at the 6th Street Orphanage soon after his birth.  A very sweet, but very quirky boy, Lewis has never found quite the right family to adopt him.  Lewis's world suddenly gets turned upside down when mysterious people begin popping into his life.  One kid, Wilber, has a time machine and takes Lewis back to the future to fix a very big mess.  There, Lewis meets the wacky Robinson family.  They would seem to be the perfect family for young Lewis, but of course, there is a catch.  Madness and mayhem ensue, and, of course, there is that pesky disturbance in the space-time contimuum to worry about.  Lewis must work hard to save the day, overcoming self doubt and evil henchmen.  In the end, he gains a loving home and family, which is all he ever wanted.MEET THE ROBINSONS is a very cute, very charming, very off beat family film.  It teaches wonderful messages:  Don't be so afraid to fail that you never try, failing is good as long as you do your best, just keep trying until you get it right.  All are excellent messages for children of all ages in today's fear of failure world.The animation is MEET THE ROBINSONS is nice looking with great vivid colors and fun images.  The world of the future is perfect...straight out of the imagination of a 12 year old boy of the early 1960s...bubble transportation, sentient robots, singing frogs...great, great fun.MEET THE ROBINSONS is the perfect family movie for a nice, entertaining evening at home.

1083429,A1W661TC1P6VQI,B000ROAK2W,"Kevin T. Rodriguez ""The Movie Wizard.com Revi...","[8, 18]","With Disney having pioneered animation in almost every form we can imagine, it's kind of amazing that for the past several years animated movies with the Disney logo on them have been pretty lame (save for the movies that also have the Pixar logo on them). ""Home On The Range"" was a weak way to end the legacy of hand drawn animated films (it felt like a direct-to-video film), and ""Chicken Little"" felt like it was made by a bunch of marketers. And considering that Disney's competition has been churning out high quality films like ""Happy Feet,"" ""Shrek,"" ""Monster House,"" and ""Curious George,"" what Disney really needs is a movie to show people that they can still make entertaining movies that can be considered classics. Alas, ""Meet The Robisons""is not a classic movie, but it is an entertaining one...for the most part.The movie opens with a hooded mother abandoning a baby on the doorsteps to an orphanage on a cold, rainy night. The boy is named Lewis, and by the age of twelve he's a genious inventor. His inventions don't always work, but he takes pride in them. So much pride, in fact, that when he goes to interviews to hopefully be adopted, he shows off his inventions to hopeful parents. To his great disapointment though, almost none of these inventions work, and when a memory retrieving machine goes haywire at the science fair Lewis decides he wants to call it quits. Then, from out of nowhere, a boy named Wilber Robison grabs Lewis and takes him to the future (mainly to prove to Lewis that, yes, he IS from the future). Lewis then finds himself in a future where people travel by bubbles, frogs sing, and Tomorrowland is now called Todayland.It's the kind of future that presents fun ideas and wild gizmos, something Walt Disney himself was quite good at imagining when he was alive. This is where the movie takes a turn for the worst, as it throws us into situations that make little to no sense, but also moves so fast and jerky that I doubt people with A.D.D. will be able to fully follow it all. This is where we meet the Robisons, who are all quirky and wacky, but lack any real substance to them. One character who does provide some fun is the evil Bowler Hat Guy (no, I'm not kidding, that's his REAL name). Bowler Hat Guy has an evil scheme, which is to go back in time and steal Lewis's science fair project invention, and...you know, it just accured to me that I'm feeling a bit nostalgic for when Disney made REAL villains! When was the last time there was a really real bad guy in a Disney film?Alameda Slim from ""Home On The Range"" yodeled to steal cows. There was no villain in ""Chicken Little."" I don't think Yzma from ""The Emperor's New Groove"" counts. Now we have Bowler Hat Guy, a bad guys who's major traits are laughing like a maniac and doodling in his pink unicorn notebook. Still, I have to confess, Bowler Hat Guy ends up being the most interesting character in this movie. Despite the fact that he's a flamboyant freak, he does have a identifiable personality, a history, and reason behind his motivations. His sidekick, a robotic hat named Doris, also has more personality then any of the Robison family members. The problems with this movie are very apparent. Based off the book ""A Day With Wilbur Robison,"" the movie tries to make the entire Robison family a major player while having no idea what to do with them.Lewis, Wilbur Robison, and Bowler Hat Guy are the only characters that do anything of significance in this movie. The whole middle section of the movie is just a bunch of random jokes and visual gags, all of which have nothing to do with the storyline at all. What does work is a very strong opening, giving us a reason to like Lewis and care about him, followed by a very strong ending. The ending in particular is going to have people talking, as it's predictable what's going to happen (considering there's a message about looking towards the future that is rammed into your head throughout the film), but I find it interesting Disney chose to go in that direction in the first place.With ""Chicken Little"" Disney lost the game due to a major strike out. With ""Meet The Robisons"" Disney has finally won a game and made a fairly entertaining movie, but it's no home run. Let's just say it's more like a couple of good hits that results in a winning game, but the middle part of the game is a bit of a drag.  On a final note, I noticed during the credits that seven people worked on the screenplay.  If ever there was an example of too many cooks being in the kitchen, this is it.Rating: *** stars",3,"No Home Run, But Still A Solid Hit",1175990400,"04 8, 2007",2007,4559,"['Disney', 'having', 'pioneered', 'animation', 'almost', 'form', 'can', 'imagine', 'kind', 'amazing', 'past', 'several', 'years', 'animated', 'movies', 'Disney', 'logo', 'have', 'been', 'pretty', 'lame', 'save', 'movies', 'also', 'have', 'Pixar', 'logo', 'Home', 'Range', 'was', 'weak', 'way', 'end', 'legacy', 'hand', 'drawn', 'animated', 'films', 'felt', 'direct-to-video', 'film', 'Chicken', 'Little', 'felt', 'was', 'made', 'bunch', 'marketers', 'considering', 'Disney', 'competition', 'been', 'churning', 'out', 'high', 'quality', 'films', 'Happy', 'Feet', 'Shrek', 'Monster', 'House', 'Curious', 'George', 'what', 'Disney', 'really', 'movie', 'show', 'people', 'can', 'still', 'make', 'entertaining', 'movies', 'can', 'be', 'considered', 'classics', 'Alas', 'Meet', 'Robisons', 'not', 'classic', 'movie', 'entertaining', 'one', 'most', 'part.The', 'movie', 'hooded', 'mother', 'abandoning', 'baby', 'doorsteps', 'orphanage', 'cold', 'rainy', 'night', 'boy', 'named', 'Lewis', 'age', 'twelve', 'genious', 'inventor', 'inventions', 'do', ""n't"", 'always', 'work', 'pride', 'So', 'much', 'pride', 'fact', 'when', 'interviews', 'hopefully', 'be', 'adopted', 'inventions', 'hopeful', 'parents', 'great', 'disapointment', 'almost', 'none', 'inventions', 'work', 'when', 'memory', 'retrieving', 'machine', 'haywire', 'science', 'fair', 'Lewis', 'call', 'Then', 'nowhere', 'boy', 'named', 'Wilber', 'Robison', 'grabs', 'Lewis', 'future', 'mainly', 'prove', 'Lewis', 'yes', 'future', 'Lewis', 'then', 'future', 'where', 'people', 'travel', 'bubbles', 'frogs', 'sing', 'Tomorrowland', 'now', 'called', 'Todayland.It', 'kind', 'future', 'presents', 'fun', 'ideas', 'wild', 'gizmos', 'something', 'Walt', 'Disney', 'was', 'quite', 'good', 'imagining', 'when', 'was', 'alive', 'where', 'movie', 'turn', 'worst', 'situations', 'make', 'little', 'sense', 'also', 'so', 'fast', 'jerky', 'doubt', 'people', 'A.D.D', 'will', 'be', 'able', 'fully', 'follow', 'where', 'meet', 'Robisons', 'who', 'are', 'quirky', 'wacky', 'lack', 'real', 'substance', 'One', 'character', 'who', 'provide', 'fun', 'evil', 'Bowler', 'Hat', 'Guy', ""'m"", 'not', 'kidding', 'REAL', 'name', 'Bowler', 'Hat', 'Guy', 'evil', 'scheme', 'go', 'back', 'time', 'steal', 'Lewis', 'science', 'fair', 'project', 'invention', 'know', 'just', 'accured', ""'m"", 'feeling', 'bit', 'nostalgic', 'when', 'Disney', 'made', 'REAL', 'villains', 'When', 'was', 'last', 'time', 'was', 'really', 'real', 'bad', 'guy', 'Disney', 'film', 'Alameda', 'Slim', 'Home', 'Range', 'yodeled', 'steal', 'cows', 'was', 'villain', 'Chicken', 'Little', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'Yzma', 'Emperor', 'New', 'Groove', 'counts', 'Now', 'have', 'Bowler', 'Hat', 'Guy', 'bad', 'guys', 'who', 'major', 'traits', 'are', 'laughing', 'maniac', 'doodling', 'pink', 'unicorn', 'notebook', 'Still', 'have', 'confess', 'Bowler', 'Hat', 'Guy', 'up', 'being', 'most', 'interesting', 'character', 'movie', 'fact', 'flamboyant', 'freak', 'have', 'identifiable', 'personality', 'history', 'reason', 'motivations', 'sidekick', 'robotic', 'hat', 'named', 'Doris', 'also', 'more', 'personality', 'then', 'Robison', 'family', 'members', 'problems', 'movie', 'are', 'very', 'apparent', 'Based', 'off', 'book', 'Day', 'Wilbur', 'Robison', 'movie', 'make', 'entire', 'Robison', 'family', 'major', 'player', 'having', 'idea', 'what', 'do', 'them.Lewis', 'Wilbur', 'Robison', 'Bowler', 'Hat', 'Guy', 'are', 'only', 'characters', 'do', 'anything', 'significance', 'movie', 'whole', 'middle', 'section', 'movie', 'just', 'bunch', 'random', 'jokes', 'visual', 'gags', 'have', 'nothing', 'do', 'storyline', 'What', 'work', 'very', 'strong', 'opening', 'giving', 'reason', 'like', 'Lewis', 'care', 'followed', 'very', 'strong', 'ending', 'ending', 'particular', 'going', 'have', 'people', 'talking', 'predictable', 'what', 'going', 'happen', 'considering', 'message', 'looking', 'future', 'rammed', 'head', 'film', 'find', 'interesting', 'Disney', 'chose', 'go', 'direction', 'first', 'place.With', 'Chicken', 'Little', 'Disney', 'lost', 'game', 'due', 'major', 'strike', 'out', 'Meet', 'Robisons', 'Disney', 'finally', 'won', 'game', 'made', 'fairly', 'entertaining', 'movie', 'home', 'run', 'Let', 'just', 'say', 'more', 'couple', 'good', 'hits', 'results', 'winning', 'game', 'middle', 'part', 'game', 'bit', 'drag', 'final', 'note', 'noticed', 'credits', 'seven', 'people', 'worked', 'screenplay', 'ever', 'was', 'example', 'too', 'many', 'cooks', 'being', 'kitchen', 'it.Rating', '***', 'stars']",N/A
1083430,A2RKI7RPP5CJMG,B000ROAK2W,"K. Fontenot ""Prairie Cajun Regenerated!""","[7, 9]","""Meet The Robinsons"" is the latest computer-animated Disney fare to hit the big screen.  While I found it very enjoyable and full of wonderful moments, I also found it lacking in a number of areas.  I'm torn between giving this film three or four stars but, being the Disney fan that I am, I rounded my score up.  The film opens with a Disney short featuring Mickey, Goofy, and Donald attempting to put a boat together.  It's very funny and my young daughter really enjoyed it.  From there, we are given a very somber opening to ""Meet The Robinsons"" where a woman leaves her son on the steps of a local orphanage.  We then jump ahead twelve years to find the youngster, Lewis, attempting to perfect his latest invention.  Along for the ride is his roommate, Goob, who is always tired due to Lewis' escapades and his baseball game suffers due to his lack of sleep.  Lewis attempts to impress families with his inventions in hopes that it will somehow help him get adopted.  The results are usually disastrous.Knowing that he isn't getting any younger, Lewis creates an invention that he thinks will tap into his memory banks so that he can remember what his mother looks like and then seek her out.  He presents his creation at the local school science fair but, as with most of his other inventions, things go awry.  At the science fair he runs into a young boy name Wilbur who claims to be from the future and is tracking down the sinister ""Bowler Hat Guy"" who stole another time machine.  From there, Lewis is whisked into the future where he runs into the Robinson family.  They're a quirky bunch to say the least, but here's where my first real problem with the film is.  None of the Robinsons are fully fleshed out.  We are given hints as to who they are but we never really get to know them because there are just too many of them.  As the rest of the story unfolds and we find out exactly why ""Bowler Hat Guy"" is doing what he's doing, we are left without really getting to know any of the characters except for Lewis.My second problem with this film is that the story seems to be needle-thin and expanded over the complete running time of the film by way of overdone moments of silliness.  Had the writers given us a little more depth in a few more of the characters and left out some of the sometimes boring slapstick moments that really didn't relate to the film, ""Meet the Robinsons"" would have been a better film.With that said, there are many highlights that make this film worthy of multiple viewings.  For one, the relationship between Lewis and the Robinsons has a number of very sentimental moments.  His roommate Goob, ever depressed, also steals a few of the scenes that he is in.  The T-Rex used so much in the film's trailers actually has a very brief role, but is another bright spot for the movie.  The voice casting was excellent as well, with one very special voice appearance near the end of the film.  There are also hints at Disneyland, Disney World, and a few inside laughs for fans of Disney.  Finally, the conclusion to the film has vintage Walt Disney written (literally) all over it.  I just wish the film as a whole could have kept up with its high points.Overall, this is a very enjoyable movie that suffers from lulls in action, poor character development, and a lack of solid direction.  However, it manages to hold your attention for the most part, hits you in the heart perfectly at times, and screams nostalgia at moments.  It'll probably make its way to my DVD collection when it finally leaves the big screen, but you might want to check it at the movies before you decide to purchase a private copy later down the road.",4,What Makes A Family A Family?,1176163200,"04 10, 2007",2007,3662,"['Meet', 'Robinsons', 'latest', 'computer-animated', 'Disney', 'fare', 'hit', 'big', 'screen', 'found', 'very', 'enjoyable', 'full', 'wonderful', 'moments', 'also', 'found', 'lacking', 'number', 'areas', ""'m"", 'torn', 'giving', 'film', 'three', 'four', 'stars', 'being', 'Disney', 'fan', 'am', 'rounded', 'score', 'up', 'film', 'Disney', 'short', 'featuring', 'Mickey', 'Goofy', 'Donald', 'attempting', 'put', 'boat', 'together', 'very', 'funny', 'young', 'daughter', 'really', 'enjoyed', 'there', 'are', 'given', 'very', 'somber', 'opening', 'Meet', 'Robinsons', 'where', 'woman', 'son', 'steps', 'local', 'orphanage', 'then', 'jump', 'ahead', 'twelve', 'years', 'find', 'youngster', 'Lewis', 'attempting', 'perfect', 'latest', 'invention', 'ride', 'roommate', 'Goob', 'who', 'always', 'tired', 'due', 'Lewis', 'escapades', 'baseball', 'game', 'suffers', 'due', 'lack', 'sleep', 'Lewis', 'impress', 'families', 'inventions', 'hopes', 'will', 'somehow', 'help', 'get', 'adopted', 'results', 'are', 'usually', 'disastrous.Knowing', ""n't"", 'getting', 'younger', 'Lewis', 'invention', 'will', 'tap', 'memory', 'banks', 'so', 'can', 'remember', 'what', 'mother', 'then', 'seek', 'out', 'creation', 'local', 'school', 'science', 'fair', 'most', 'other', 'inventions', 'things', 'go', 'awry', 'science', 'fair', 'young', 'boy', 'name', 'Wilbur', 'who', 'be', 'future', 'tracking', 'down', 'sinister', 'Bowler', 'Hat', 'Guy', 'who', 'stole', 'time', 'machine', 'there', 'Lewis', 'whisked', 'future', 'where', 'Robinson', 'family', ""'re"", 'quirky', 'bunch', 'say', 'least', 'here', 'where', 'first', 'real', 'problem', 'film', 'None', 'Robinsons', 'are', 'fully', 'fleshed', 'out', 'are', 'given', 'hints', 'who', 'are', 'never', 'really', 'get', 'know', 'are', 'just', 'too', 'many', 'rest', 'story', 'unfolds', 'find', 'out', 'exactly', 'why', 'Bowler', 'Hat', 'Guy', 'doing', 'what', 'doing', 'are', 'left', 'really', 'getting', 'know', 'characters', 'Lewis.My', 'second', 'problem', 'film', 'story', 'be', 'needle-thin', 'expanded', 'complete', 'running', 'time', 'film', 'way', 'overdone', 'moments', 'silliness', 'Had', 'writers', 'given', 'little', 'more', 'depth', 'few', 'more', 'characters', 'left', 'out', 'sometimes', 'boring', 'slapstick', 'moments', 'really', 'did', ""n't"", 'relate', 'film', 'Meet', 'Robinsons', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'better', 'film.With', 'said', 'are', 'many', 'highlights', 'make', 'film', 'worthy', 'multiple', 'viewings', 'one', 'relationship', 'Lewis', 'Robinsons', 'number', 'very', 'sentimental', 'moments', 'roommate', 'Goob', 'ever', 'depressed', 'also', 'few', 'scenes', 'T-Rex', 'used', 'so', 'much', 'film', 'trailers', 'actually', 'very', 'brief', 'role', 'bright', 'spot', 'movie', 'voice', 'casting', 'was', 'excellent', 'as', 'well', 'one', 'very', 'special', 'voice', 'appearance', 'end', 'film', 'are', 'also', 'hints', 'Disneyland', 'Disney', 'World', 'few', 'inside', 'laughs', 'fans', 'Disney', 'Finally', 'conclusion', 'film', 'vintage', 'Walt', 'Disney', 'written', 'literally', 'just', 'wish', 'film', 'whole', 'could', 'have', 'kept', 'up', 'high', 'points.Overall', 'very', 'enjoyable', 'movie', 'suffers', 'lulls', 'action', 'poor', 'character', 'development', 'lack', 'solid', 'direction', 'However', 'hold', 'attention', 'most', 'part', 'heart', 'perfectly', 'times', 'screams', 'nostalgia', 'moments', ""'ll"", 'probably', 'make', 'way', 'DVD', 'collection', 'when', 'finally', 'big', 'screen', 'might', 'want', 'check', 'movies', 'decide', 'purchase', 'private', 'copy', 'later', 'road']",N/A

All of these movies follow a theme, and all of them are released by Disney, they all follow the trend of figuring out who you are, where you came from, and where you are going.In the case of ""Meet the Robinson's"", it is the only recent Disney movie made independent of Pixar that has been worth seeing (I saw it six times in the theater, full price).  It is clich&eacute;, and it has a few plot holes, but the positive elements out way any negative aspects in this movie.  It is clean, fun, and refreshing.The movie follows Lewis a young orphan/struggling scientist, who is on a mission to find his birth mother.  It opens with him being left at the doorsteps of the orphanage where he lives, and seeing this scene alone in digital 3-D was worth the price.  He works all night on his projects and keep his roommate up all night who seeks to be good at baseball, but fails because he is so tired.  After Lewis finally creates the project he believes will reveal his mother to him, he is whisked away to the future and is on a quest to stop ""Bowler Hat Guy"".  On the way, he meets a quirky family that makes Lewis seem normal.The one reason that ""Meet the Robison's"" stands out amongst the gamut of new animated films, is because of its clever yet corny sense of humor.  Disney takes some risk with a stab at the matrix and Asian cinema with what we will call the ""Meatball fight"".  There of course is the odd morbid humor that ""Bowler Hat Guy"" produces.  He has most of the quotable lines such as ""Ooooh, I know, I could turn him into a duck!"" and ""Prepare to be amazed!""On the other hand if you are expecting something groundbreaking, you will be disappointed, ""Meet the Robinson's"" is not groundbreaking, but has the potential to be a cult-classic.  If you enjoy you movies silly, and want something clean, and original, you will like ""Meet the Robinson's"".  Other wise, steer clear, because it is cheesy, overly sentimental, and corny; those are the things that make this movie so endearing!!!God Bless & *ENJOY* ~Amy",5,"Silly, fun, and worth watching again and AGAIN!",1188777600,"09 3, 2007",2007,2270,"['Much', 'main', 'character', 'Lewis', 'trying', 'discover', 'where', 'animated', 'films', 'are', 'following', 'trend', 'getting', 'back', 'bare', 'bowns', 'story-telling', 'such', 'movies', 'Meet', 'Robisons', 'Cars', 'Ratatouille', 'movies', 'follow', 'theme', 'are', 'released', 'Disney', 'follow', 'trend', 'figuring', 'out', 'who', 'are', 'where', 'came', 'where', 'are', 'going.In', 'case', 'Meet', 'Robinson', 'only', 'recent', 'Disney', 'movie', 'made', 'independent', 'Pixar', 'been', 'worth', 'seeing', 'saw', 'six', 'times', 'theater', 'full', 'price', 'clich', 'eacute', 'few', 'plot', 'holes', 'positive', 'elements', 'out', 'way', 'negative', 'aspects', 'movie', 'clean', 'fun', 'refreshing.The', 'movie', 'Lewis', 'young', 'orphan/struggling', 'scientist', 'who', 'mission', 'find', 'birth', 'mother', 'being', 'left', 'doorsteps', 'orphanage', 'where', 'seeing', 'scene', 'alone', 'digital', '3-D', 'was', 'worth', 'price', 'all', 'night', 'projects', 'keep', 'roommate', 'up', 'night', 'who', 'be', 'good', 'baseball', 'so', 'tired', 'Lewis', 'finally', 'project', 'will', 'reveal', 'mother', 'whisked', 'away', 'future', 'quest', 'stop', 'Bowler', 'Hat', 'Guy', 'way', 'quirky', 'family', 'Lewis', 'seem', 'normal.The', 'one', 'reason', 'Meet', 'Robison', 'out', 'gamut', 'new', 'animated', 'films', 'clever', 'yet', 'corny', 'sense', 'humor', 'Disney', 'risk', 'stab', 'matrix', 'Asian', 'cinema', 'what', 'will', 'call', 'Meatball', 'fight', 'course', 'odd', 'morbid', 'humor', 'Bowler', 'Hat', 'Guy', 'most', 'quotable', 'lines', 'such', 'Ooooh', 'know', 'could', 'turn', 'duck', 'Prepare', 'be', 'amazed', 'other', 'hand', 'are', 'expecting', 'something', 'groundbreaking', 'will', 'be', 'disappointed', 'Meet', 'Robinson', 'not', 'groundbreaking', 'potential', 'be', 'cult-classic', 'enjoy', 'movies', 'silly', 'want', 'something', 'clean', 'original', 'will', 'like', 'Meet', 'Robinson', 'Other', 'wise', 'steer', 'clear', 'cheesy', 'overly', 'sentimental', 'corny', 'are', 'things', 'make', 'movie', 'so', 'endearing', 'God', 'Bless', '*ENJOY*', '~Amy']",N/A

He has had lots of adoption interviews, but he always seems to scare off his perspective parents with his latest invention.See, he's a genius.  He's got these great ideas; they just don't quite work right, usually resulting in a mess.  But this time, he's got just the thing.  He's invented a memory retriever.  He just knows it will win the science fair.But there's a strange boy at the science fair.  He claims his name is Wilbur and he's from the future.  Wilbur is there to stop Bowler Hat Guy, also from the future.  But he won't tell Lewis what BHG is planning.When Lewis' invention malfunctions, he's crushed.  But Wilbur shows up again, telling him to keep working on it.  And to prove he's from the future, Wilbur takes Lewis there, only to have them crash land the time machine.Meanwhile, BHG is trying to sell Lewis' invention as his own.  Will he succeed?  Does the machine work?  Will Lewis get home?  Does he want to?This movie is an over the top comedy.  Wilbur's family, while lovable, is also extremely strange.  Silly yet fun.  But the funniest character of all is BHG.  He appears to have learned how to be a villain from the melodrama school of villainy.  He comes complete with the black cape, mustache, and menacing laugh.  I honestly felt like I needed to boo him when he appeared.  Yet he is completely stupid, too.  I haven't laughed that hard at a character in a long time.While the movie was extremely funny, the plot was a little weak.  I'm not bothered by predictable plots (which this was).  What bothered me here was how simple it was.  It needed to lose a few of the jokes for another twist or a better climax.Saving the movie is the character of Lewis.  I truly felt for him very early on and spent the rest of the film rooting for him.The voice cast is mostly unknowns with one or two exceptions.  This harkens back to the Disney of old that used a voice because it was right and not because it was already a name.  The animation is fine without doing anything extraordinary.Then there's the theme.  Over the course of the movie, Lewis learns that you have to keep looking forward.  You can't live in the regrets of the past or look at your failures.  And you can't stop because of one success.  You must keep pressing on.  After the movie ends, they throw a quote from Walt Disney up talking about that very thing.  I think they were making a point to fans like me who are upset with some of the changes they have made to the company in the last decade.  And, while I hope they don't forget their past, I get their point.  So I guess I must let them keep moving forward.The movie is silly and will easily appeal to kids.  Yet it isn't so stupid that it will turn off parents.  And the underlying theme is good (even if I am reading too much into it.)

1083441,A139ZF7CJVVTJU,B000ROAK2W,"Mark Eremite ""This Is A Display Model Only""","[10, 16]","The requirements for an animated Disney film are pretty uniform: chewy, candy-corn visuals, wacky characters, and a saccharine-heavy moral that is palatable to all tongues.  If you take a look at some of the big hits from the past several years (Antz,The Incredibles,Monsters, Inc., and so on), these commonalities stand out.  Lotsa fun stuff to look at, lotsa silly mouths for silly jokes, and virtually every movie offers a retread on the same basic message: have faith in yourself, but don't forget the value of friends, family, and teamwork.""Meet The Robinsons"" fits the standard, that's for sure.  We've got a young orphan, Lewis, whose eccentric proclivity for wacky inventions keeps him from getting adopted by parents who are more interested in a conventionally sports-loving son.  Constant rejection gets to poor Lewis, and in a last bid for redemption, he invents a device that will project onto a TV any memory anyone's ever made, hoping that he can pull from his own brain a picture of the mother who long ago abandoned him on the steps of the orphanage.  Before he can demonstrate his device, though, it is sabotaged and stolen by a toothpick-thin man wearing a robotic bowler hat.  The villain is called, ingeniously, ""Bowler Hat Guy.""Ahem.Before he knows what's going on, Lewis is whisked away by a young fellow named Wilbur Robinson.  Wilbur has a time machine, is from the future, and says that if the memory machine isn't returned to Lewis, then the future is doomed.  The movie gets frenetic, zipping forward into the future where Lewis meets the bloatedly goofy Robinson clan and battles time travelling T-Rex's and his own self-doubts.  Does he succeed?  You tell me; it's a Disney film.""Meet the Robinsons"" fits the bill in all the ways that makes a movie child-friendly, and for an age where ADD seems preprogramed into children, ""Robinsons"" scatter-brained looniness will sate more than a few young eyes and minds.  However, producers of sophisticated kid's movies have learned well the lesson that parents should like it, too, since they're the one's footing the bill.  Considering this, and comparing it to the stiff competition that's out there in theatres and on DVD, ""Robinsons"" falls far short.Ten different people worked on this movie's script, and it's obvious.  Exhaustingly, ridiculously obvious.  Instead of writing clever jokes, pithy one-liners, inoffensive double entendres, or even just plain silly dialogue, these ten writers gave us the Robinsons, a family so large you'd need a spreadsheet to keep track of every character, never mind each character's various idiosyncracies.  There's Wilbur's grandfather, Bud, married to Lucille, both of them parents-in-law to Franny, who owns a band of singing frogs.  Let's not forget the twins who live in large pots by the front door and who get some kind of pleasure out of having their doorbells pressed, the octopus butler, Lefty, Wilbur's uncles Art (pizza delivery man) and Gaston (cannon fetish), his great-uncle Fritz (mad-man with a puppet named Petunia for a wife) and Fritz's children, Tallulah and Laszlo.  There's also a woman named Billie (train fetish) and her husband, Joe, a man whose morbid obesity and obsession with TV doesn't seem to bother anyone.The point here is that the large family is something the orphaned Lewis has always dreamed of being a part of.  It's a big warm hug for the kid, and it's also a chance, I guess, to make the movie funny.  But the scriptwriters failed to realize that weird does not always equal humorous.

When, after a particularly stinging rejection from a prospective family due to an experiment gone wrong, Lewis fails miserably at a science fair, his confidence is crushed and he ready to give up on science. Life has many surprises in store for him, though, among them a trip to the future and tons of new friends, that will teach him that, in order to achieve success, all you really need to do is keep moving forward.On the whole, I can say that I really liked this quirky and engaging Disney movie.

1083444,A1U360OMVQRPUB,B000ROAK2W,Mel Odom,"[7, 10]","MEET THE ROBINSONS is a great film for family viewing. The rapid-fire pace of the plot, the totally understandable plot lines and character motivations, and the breezy dialogue are probably enough to keep younger minds (and older ones that sometimes struggle with such simplistic fare) occupied. But when a cool, futuristic world with strange machines and whacky people are thrown in, choosing Meet the Robinsons is a no-brainer.The movie is the 46th animated feature from Walt Disney Studios. Although it definitely lacks the crispness of a Pixar production, the animation is fluid and colorful, but after seeing everything Pixar is capable of, I couldn't help comparing one to the other.One of the strange things about the movie is that it's adapted from a book that really isn't anything like the movie, save for the weird cast of family characters. The book is called A DAY WITH WILBUR ROBINSON and was written by William Joyce. Lewis isn't even a character in this book, nor is the book set in the future. However, the plot centers around trying to find Grandpa's teeth, which is featured for a short time in the movie.I immediately liked Lewis, the movie's main character. When the story opened up with the young mother dropping baby Lewis off at the orphanage in the rain, the heartstrings  get tugged fiercely. This familiar scene drags the audience right in to the rest of the story.As resident genius of the orphanage, Lewis inadvertently makes everyone's life miserable to a degree. But he's like an energetic puppy and wins the audience over. Not only that, but his attempts at creating inventions are laugh-out-loud funny. The peanut butter/jelly gun toaster is amazing, and a joke they reuse later in the film to great success.Lewis knows he's about to get too old for adoption, so he throws himself into his inventions again. He wants to build a memory projector that will allow him to reach into his own mind to see his mother and find out why she dropped him off at the orphanage. His teacher encourages Lewis to bring the device to the Science Fair. One of the best parts of the film is watching the students' reactions to the unveiling of the inventions. Adults and kids will die laughing because Lewis is so earnest, yet so doomed to failure.The Science Fair turns mysterious almost immediately. Wilbur Robinson begins stalking Lewis. When Wilbur's caught by Lewis, Wilbur tries to pass himself off as a time cop and says he's there to fix the past. He warns Lewis about the Bowler Hat Guy trying to ruin Lewis's invention, but Lewis is convinced that the reason his new invention failed is the same reason all the others failed, that he, Lewis, simply isn't good at inventing things.To prove to Lewis that he's telling the truth, Wilbur takes Lewis into the future. The movie really jets forward at this point. Of course, the boys don't agree about things and the time machine ends up getting crashed. Wilbur expects Lewis to know how to fix it.The action turns incredibly zany at this point as Lewis meets Grandpa Bud and is taken on a tour of the house. In this madcap section, the humor is over-the-top funny but laid my ten-year-old and I both to waste as we struggled to keep up with all the rapid-fire cuts from one scene to the next. This is truly great stuff, and works perfectly in the movie at this point.Lewis ends up getting to stay for dinner and getting to meet the rest of the family, including Wilbur's mom, Franny, who conducts a frog band. The frog band, although only a small part of the overall movie, is unforgettable. The lead frog acts and croons like Frank Sinatra, and leads the other frogs like a Mafia hard guy. One of the best scenes is when mini-Doris (the robotic hat that controls/leads Bowler Hat Guy) gets captured by the frogs and thrown into the back of a toy Cadillac.The rest of the movie will probably be easy to figure out, even for the little people, but it's still a wonderful trip to take on family night viewing. My youngster and I finished up the film and he immediately watched it again.The headlong rush of the plot to get causes viewers to gloss over the great voice acting of some of the people involved with the film. Angela Bassett is wonderful as Mildred, the director of the orphanage. Her constant support of Lewis as he deals with his inventing bug and the fact that he can't get adopted is great.  She even still manages to put a trace of exasperation into her delivery.Goob, Lewis's roommate, is a gem. I love him in his little league baseball uniform and talking about how much he stunk up the field. As a little league coach, I try not to let any kid on my team feel that way, but I know there are a lot of kids who end up feeling exactly like that anyway.MEET THE ROBINSONS isn't the best of the Disney films, but it's definitely a welcome addition. In fact, Cornelius Robinson's motto, ""Keep moving forward,"" comes from a speech Walt Disney himself made on several occasions to the creative minds that worked for him, and that's just what Walt

Despite being cared for by the head of the orphanage (Angela Bassett), he hoped to find a potential family to adopt him. However, his recent Memory Scanner failed him at the science fair. His spiral into depression was recently lifted by a task force officer by the name of Wilbur Robinson (Wesley Singerman), the son of a highly populated family that consists of his mother Franny (Nicole Sullivan), a leader of a singing troupe of frogs; his uncle Art (Adam West), a pizza delivery man who acts like a superhero; his Grandpa Bud (Stephen J. Anderson), who frequently loses his teeth; and many more. Lewis bonds with this family, but his bliss takes a turn for the worst when a bowler hat-wearing villain (Stephen J. Anderson) looks to basically ruin the youngster's life.""Meet the Robinsons"" is the second Disney feature in a row to use CGI technology without the help of Pixar. The first one was the vastly underappreciated ""Chicken Little"". Admittedly, the film didn't walk a perfectly straight line between ""Shrek""-like hipness and the heartwarming teachings of family that the House of Mouse was known for quite some time. But I must have been the only one to fall in love with this madcap - and sweet - animated comedy. It was also a sign of Disney willing to try new things outside of the ordinary. Sadly, ""Robinsons"" places Disney at square one again.That's not to say there's some charm in there. Directed by Stephen J. Anderson, who voices various characters in the film, Robinsons is able to paint its protoganist with plenty of colors. Lewis so desperately wants not to be an orphan now that he's become a pre-teen, and the disappointment of not getting that need for love is touching. Though voiced by two child actors, Lewis is definitely a kid in his own right, and very lovable.Anderson does have a good funny bone, and that's what helps the movie the most. Like Little, ""Robinsons"" is filled with plenty pop cultural references and spoofs of classic movies or TV shows. A list: a spoof of kung-fu films with awful voice dubbing and monoraul sounds, the frogs putting Bowler Hat Guy's hat in a truck with the view from inside the trunk looking at the frogs (a nod to Quentin Tarantino), Adam West's oft hilarious line readings as the uncle who thinks he's a hero, a giant T-Rex who has a big head and little arms (subtitled, due to his hard-to-understand voice), a nervous robot (underrated comic Harland Williams) who wants Lewis to build him to look like a buff swimsuit model, and plenty more.However, Robinsons fails when it wants to do more than tickle the funny bone. Anderson does so good at doing this, that when he wants to become part of a worthy director of Disney films, it takes a toll on the pace of the film. One minute we're witnessing Bowler Hat Guy trying to get a handle of innocent bystanders he tries to convert into evil (the best bit includes talking to the frog, which has a hint of playfulness that's ALWAYS welcome to a Disney film), the next we're being handed the origins of how he came to be. It hurts the character development of the villain. The film ends with a respectable enough conclusion, but when it's topped off by a godawful song by Rob Thomas, it doesn't mesh well with the overall tone of the film. I don't mind affectionate messages of acception, but subtlety is often the key.It's a testament that Nicole Sullivan saves the film from veering into sentimentality. A graduate of the sketch comedy known as ""MadTV"", Sullivan squeezes out plenty of funny moments, but she actually won me the hell over with her wealth of tenderness, especially in the scene where she welcomes Lewis into the family (well, almost). It's not worthy of squeezing out tears, but Sullivan deserves a standing ovation for keeping things genuine.""Robinsons"" is not by all means a bad film. But where Chicken Little ended with the cast belting out ""Don't Go Breaking My Heart"" in respectable fashion, this movie ends with a quote from Walt Disney himself begging for affection, then a bunch of characters running across the screen during a crappy punk rock song. It's a nice change of pace, but after I graduated from the animated comedy class post 2001, I felt that I deserved more. Hell, even Pixar's films ended with outtakes, or even a bit of self-deprecation (as seen in ""Cars""' ending, and the dedication of a deceased cast member was alright). Let's hope whatever non-Pixar effort from the Mouse House can focus less on pulling on the heartstrings shamelessly, and deliver a simple film with enough laughs.",3,"""Dude...

1083457,A2UQIIJ2CD8REE,B000ROAK2W,Monty Moonlight,"[0, 0]","""Meet the Robinsons"" is the story of an orphan named Lewis who dreams to be an inventor. That is, until his first great invention, a machine to project his earliest memories and give him a look at his real mother, malfunctions and causes the destruction of a school science fair. Enter Wilbur Robinson, a visitor from the future who has shown up pursuing a time machine thief known as the Bowler Hat Guy. It's Bowler Hat Guy's scheme to steal Lewis's invention and claim it as his own, and in attempting to set things right, Wilbur soon finds himself bringing Lewis to the future where he meets the entire, totally bizarre Robinson family. As a busted time machine and antics with the relatives keep Lewis and Wilbur busy, Bowler Hat Guy continues with his nefarious plan, which turns out to be even more horrible than he himself intended.Sorta like Back to the Future meets Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory, meets... I don't know, something with Jim Carrey, ""Meet the Robinsons"" surprises in that it is mostly a really cool and heartwarming movie. Why is that a surprise from Disney, the company from whom one should expect such things? Well, Meet the Robinsons came out as a glimmer of hope on the edge of what I'd call a pretty dark time for Disney, when the powers that be had unjustly lost faith in 2D animation and were blindly attempting to be a force in the computer animation explosion. Rather than let the masters at PIXAR handle the CGI animated films for the house of mouse and continuing to focus on what THEY were best at, Disney wanted everything to go CG and went down a very shameful route for the leader in family entertainment: They copied what they saw from OTHER studios, most specifically Dreamworks with their Shrek franchise. The result was the near abomination known as ""Chicken Little"", a painful exercise in mimicry. But, eventually came this film, ""Meet the Robinsons"", and thankfully, while still having a BIG issue, it is a huge improvement. The lead characters of Lewis, Wilbur, and Bowler Hat Guy are great. The villainous aspect is excellent, and so is the sweetly inspiring story of hope, faith, and never giving up; always looking towards the future. ""Keep moving forward!"" is the often declared motto of the film. The visuals look great, and even though I am not a fan of pop music in CGI animated films due to its contributing to having that Dreamworks copycat feel, at least there's some really good, original pop music in this one. So, what's that one issue I still have with this otherwise really good little sci-fi comedy-adventure? The comedy.You know that uncomfortable feeling when you're trying to watch a comedy, especially with another person, and the jokes just aren't funny? When Disney has this problem, maybe it's because I'm a Disney fanatic, but it is just sooo upsetting to me. The worst part is that you can tell, even within the movie itself, that the filmmakers though it was HILARIOUS. ""Meet the Robinsons"" has some genuinely funny stuff throughout, and then it's got some jokes that fall flat, but you KNOW the filmmakers thought they were gold, and probably a lot of lightheaded moviegoers (apparently filling the focus groups). For example, the line given by the Wednesday Addams-esque character early in the film. No one loves Wednesday more than I, and okay, it's not too original, but having a character like that there with an unpleasant science project is an okay (if overused) sight gag, but the line and it's delivery just weren't funny. They shouldn't have milked that character even that much, because she was a bad Wednesday knock off to begin with. Then there's the Duck line that Bowler Hat Guy uses later. In the commentary, the director goes on about how amazingly hilarious it is. It's really not. Otherwise though, I do find Bowler Hat Guy a great and truly funny character. It's just, sometimes Disney's modern writers write jokes that seem to be TRYING TOO HARD to be funny and end up not funny at all. However, those little bits I just mentioned were no big deal. I can live with a couple not so funny jokes like that. The problem with ""Meet the Robinsons"" is actually one huge comedy bit that just sinks like a stone and yet is a centerpiece of the movie and clearly thought by the creators to be amazingly hilarious! It's the sequence in which Lewis meets Wilbur's bizarre family. It's meant to be a collection of site gags, only, none of them have any humor to them! It is soooo frustrating and embarrassing to watch, because you know the idea is to have you laughing out loud, but no dice. This section of this otherwise lovely film is just awful, literally awful. Sadly, this is the section that is most taken from the book the film is based on, ""A Day with Wilbur Robinson"", though how close it is to the book I can't say. There are some bits that worked or could have worked. A family member who appears to be some great superhero but is just a pizza delivery guy, another who believes he is married to his hand puppet, but most of the stuff is just weird without any logic or real punchline to it. A lady with a train. Okay. Granny likes to disco dance and they call it ""baking cookies"". Hmm. Grandpa wears his clothes backwards. Why? A pair of twins who hide in flower pots and try to get people to ring the doorbell. Again, why? Oh, and one guy is fat and cries if he doesn't get peanut butter and jelly. Nice stereotyping. Okay, turns out the point of all this is that you can do anything you want in this family, but this isn't stated, and this doesn't appear to be people doing anything they want, it appears to be people who are mostly insane. The worst part though, is the way it's all thrown at you to imply it is a series of hilarious gags, when there really isn't much in it to laugh at since it doesn't even make enough sense to be a joke. Okay, I know I'm being really hard on the movie and filmmakers right now, but it ticks me off that this part of the movie exists when the rest of it is pretty great. I'm only going to dock this film one star, and that's because this sequence was awful. I'm maybe being a bit generous though, because this sequence was REALLY awful.However, as I said, everything else about the film is great. Even some of the wacky dinner with the Robinson family was funny (like the food fight, for a while). ""Meet the Robinsons"" sadly could have been excellent, but it has that one dark spot and mixed results in general when it comes to the humor. I still recommend it though. It's much better than ""Chicken Little"", that's for sure. I of course ought to give that one a rewatch and see if I like it better these days, eventually, but I remember having negative feelings about it upon a second viewing too. Anyway, go ahead and pick up Robinsons with some confidence, but be prepared for that awful barrage of bad jokes in that one sequence. Suffer through it though. The rest of the film is excellent, and better than even the first part would lead you to expect. Here's hoping that Disney's own CGI films will continue to get better (especially after PIXAR threw us that dud, ""Cars 2""). I don't know if ""Gnomeo and Juliet"" is truly counted as a ""Disney animated feature"" in this line or not, and I haven't heard good things (haven't seen it yet), but I know ""Bolt"" was pretty good. Haven't seen it recently enough to comment on if it is better than Robinsons or not though. I'll have to put that one on soon too. I do remember it being a win and worth picking up as well though. BUT, I still say Disney should leave the CGI in their company to PIXAR, whom they now own fully, and stick to putting out great stuff like ""Princess and the Frog"" and ""Winnie the Pooh"". They are the masters of traditional animation, and with all the CGI out there these days, it is always a refreshing and downright charming break from the norm.As for this Blu-Ray release's bonus features, they are pretty nice for a Disney release. We actually get a director commentary, as I mentioned before, and it has fun interruptions by Bowler Hat Guy. There are deleted scenes too, plus two music videos (Jonas Bros. and Rob Thomas), a nice behind the scenes featurettes like Disney should include on ALL their films, a featurette on famous inventions, and two games that are actually pretty fun, especially the rather difficult Bowler Hat Barrage! Game. And, of course, the movie looks and sounds great. Recommended for anyone able to tolerate one really bad comedy sequence for the sake of an otherwise really good movie! The climax and post-climax payoffs are all worth that sore spot.

Your kids (and maybe you) can enjoy this movie without all the stuff movie makers assume we secretly crave in our family entertainment (e.g., double entendres, guns and violence, cross-dressing, sexual banter, whiny and mean kids, etc.).But judging from my son's reaction, as well as my own, this is just a so-so movie. His complaint: not enough humor. My complaint: too much frenetic action.I did like that the story of this quirky kid looking for a home unfolds over the course of the movie. You get little clues along the way that there's more to the story than meets the eye. I appreciate when a scriptwriter or author assumes I have some intelligence and need not be knocked over the head with THE BIG IDEA.Still, the movie exhausted me visually. The scenes and characters are jittery, popping in and out and hopping around so fast your eyes can't keep up (well, maybe young eyes can!). When things take a turn for the worse for our heroes -- as of course they must -- I was truly creeped out by the scenario.But I must say I liked some of the major themes of the movie; that you can be yourself and be accepted; that you need to keep at something until you finish it; that failure can be applauded as an acceptable route to success.

1083462,A1DK5AZMXS1QA3,B000ROAK2W,Newton Ooi,"[0, 1]","Since Disney released the Swiss Family Robinson in 1960, Hollywood has intermittently released adventure movies based on a Robinson family whose members are intellectually gifted, though sometimes lacking emotionally satisfying family lives.  The latest version of this is Meet the Robinsons, Disney's other cartoon release of 2007, the primary one being Ratatouille.  Highly promoted on TV and in the theaters, it did not do well at the box office.Watching this movie, one realizes it is not a normal cartoon.  First of, it is not very funny.  There are occasional funny scenes, but there are too many ridiculous scenes that were too stupid to be funny; many of them include the villian of the story, the guy in the Bowler hat.  Another striking departure from standard Disney fare is the lack of a memorable song or soundtrack.  Its as if the moviemakers did not even try to include a great song.  Probably the biggest difference between this and other Disney cartoons is the absolute lack of a big name actor or actress.  Once you set aside these omissions, the movie is actually OK.  The plot is original, though not quite innovative.  The characters are unique, though none are memorable.  The meaning behind the movie is good, and its happy ending was probably the best part of it.

1083463,AHF97M45JFCB,B000ROAK2W,ONENEO,"[0, 2]","When it comes to Disney, Pixar has been a behind-the-scenes factor far before their official merger in 2006.  2007's Meet the Robinsons boasts John Lasseter's influence as the fusion between Disney and Pixar occurred during the production of the film (when Lasseter became the chief creative officer for the Walt Disney Company).Coming in at a runtime of 95-minutes and paced flawlessly, Meet the Robinsons can probably best be described as Disney's colorful and charming take on Back to the Future.The story centers on Lewis, an aspiring young inventor at an orphanage whose wacky inventions have been scaring off potential adopters. He comes to the realization that his birth mother is the only one who ever truly loved him and sets off to build a machine to scan the farthest reaches of his memory banks in effort to locate her.The simplicity of Lewis' life takes a massive twist when a guy his age shows up at the very science fair he intends to debut his memory scanner claiming to be a cop from the future.  Before long Lewis finds himself time traveling to one of the wackiest futures imaginable while being pursued by a mysterious villain in a bowling hat.My summary sounds simplistic but the fact of the matter is that, unlike so many films geared to the younger set, there is some genuine thought-provoking depth to this one.  In fact, and not to give anything away, I'm still pondering the relationships of all of the individuals Lewis encounters when whisked away to the year 2037.Speaking of, as a society, we've collectively been treated to a wide variety of interpretations of the future throughout the years in film, but it's a pretty safe bet that none can come close to emulating the sheer hilarious craziness of Meet the Robinsons (which technically owes a lot of its credit from the children's book on which the film is based: A Day With Wilbur Robinson by William Joyce).People traveling in bubbles, topiary gardens, giant squid butlers, a man married to a hand puppet, a pizza delivery man/ superhero wannabe; the encounters young Lewis experiences in his first few minutes in the future are bizarre, wacky, in some cases over-the-top silly but undeniably entertaining.Like most Disney feature films, the attention to detail is impeccable.  In fact, save for a few paradoxes inherent in all time travel scenarios, the science isn't even overly laughable either.  Unless of course your goal is to laugh, in which case, like Back to the Future before it, viewers of all ages are free to simply sit back and enjoy the ride without any dreaded brain-pretzeling.  Kids will laugh at the visuals, the antics and the obvious gags; adults will enjoy the layered depth and the intricacies of the plot (and the accuracy of the time line that can only be verified by repeated viewings).In all, though considered a commercial and critical success, I was actually surprised that Meet the Robinsons hasn't achieved the type of universal charm present in nearly anything Pixar touches.  Perhaps some of this is due to the simple fact that after the original agreement with Pixar expired, Disney decided they could do the whole compuer-generated feature film thing on their own and formed the Walt Disney Animation Studios, of which this is the first film.Of course, in the middle a new agreement with Pixar would be reached and hence Lasseter and company would integrate during production.  It's rumored that after having screened the film to Lasseter, some 60% of the material was altered to his suggestions into what is now the final version of the piece (a particular addition coming in the form of a T-rex having been transplanted from the Cretaceous running amok in the year 2037).Factor in a whimsical score by legendary composer Danny Elfman and the package all comes together.

He was well cared for there, but he was a special child and every couple that came to interview him for adoption was looking for a ""normal"" little boy. His rare talent for invention impressed no one. Rather than try to find a couple who would appreciate his gift, he decided to use it -- by inventing a machine that would help him find his real mom. In the most unlikely events that follow Lewis met the most amazing family and began to long for one of his own. Conflict arose and he found himself struggling between his loss of confidence and the need to use his gift to save the day...and the future.When the previews came out, Meet The Robinsons was not a movie I planned to see. It looked like a movie for young children. I like a lot of kids' movies, but of a certain type. There are many that appeal to an older audience, and many that do not. I felt like there was nothing I would get from this one, so I wouldn't bother. But then I heard some surprisingly favorable reviews.Meet The Robinsons is a fun story about a boy who has a chance to help other people if only he can believe in himself.

That's not really much of a surprise given that the scenario centers around a young orphan boy with a knack for inventions who spends most of the movie traveling back and forth in time between the future and the present in a tale so convoluted that even adults may have trouble fully comprehending all of it.For much of the duration, ""Meet the Robinsons"" feels frenetic and undisciplined, seemingly willing to throw just about everything but the kitchen sink into the mix in the hope that somehow it will all come together in the end.  This explains why the movie features a family of eccentric nitwits (the Robinsons), a rampaging tyrannosaurus rex brought back from the past, and a villain with a Snidely Whiplash moustache whose sidekick is a mechanical bowler hat that makes R2D2-type noises.Yet, towards the end, the movie does, in fact, manage to bring most of these disparate elements together and to arrive finally at a satisfying conclusion.  The backgrounds and animation are not quite up to the standards set by, say, ""Ratatouille"" or ""Wall-E,"" but the brightness of the colors, the quickness of the pacing and the enthusiasm of the vocal performances should keep the little ones intrigued for the duration - even if they don`t always get what`s going on in the story.",3,not a classic but reasonably entertaining,1223337600,"10 7, 2008",2008,1409,"['Meet', 'Robinsons', 'animated', 'children', 'movie', 'may', 'be', 'just', 'bit', 'too', 'complicated', 'intended', 'audience', 'follow', 'not', 'really', 'much', 'surprise', 'given', 'scenario', 'young', 'orphan', 'boy', 'knack', 'inventions', 'who', 'most', 'movie', 'traveling', 'back', 'forth', 'time', 'future', 'present', 'tale', 'so', 'convoluted', 'even', 'adults', 'may', 'have', 'trouble', 'fully', 'comprehending', 'it.For', 'much', 'duration', 'Meet', 'Robinsons', 'feels', 'frenetic', 'undisciplined', 'seemingly', 'willing', 'throw', 'just', 'everything', 'kitchen', 'sink', 'mix', 'hope', 'somehow', 'will', 'come', 'together', 'end', 'why', 'movie', 'family', 'eccentric', 'nitwits', 'Robinsons', 'rampaging', 'tyrannosaurus', 'rex', 'brought', 'back', 'past', 'villain', 'Snidely', 'Whiplash', 'moustache', 'sidekick', 'mechanical', 'bowler', 'hat', 'R2D2-type', 'noises.Yet', 'end', 'movie', 'fact', 'manage', 'bring', 'most', 'disparate', 'elements', 'together', 'arrive', 'finally', 'satisfying', 'conclusion', 'backgrounds', 'animation', 'are', 'not', 'quite', 'standards', 'set', 'say', 'Ratatouille', 'Wall-E', 'brightness', 'colors', 'quickness', 'pacing', 'enthusiasm', 'vocal', 'performances', 'should', 'keep', 'little', 'ones', 'intrigued', 'duration', 'even', 'don', 't', 'always', 'get', 'what', 's', 'going', 'story']",N/A

Animated movies have never been my type of movies.I saw the music video with Rob Thomas singing ""Little Wonders."" It shows small clips of the movie. Fell in love with the face expression of the little boy at the end of the video. And told myself I have to see this movie.The story is a very sophisticated one involving time travel. Lewis is an extremely bright 12 years old orphaned boy who was abandoned by his mother as a baby. He invents this time machine for a school's science fair which malfunctions because someone from the future wants his invention. Goob, his roommate, becomes evil in the future because he fails to catch a fly ball in a little league game (this is the present) due to lack of sleep (being kept up all night by Lewis working on his invention). Goob comes back to the past so that he could steals Lewis's invention.Another boy comes and whisk Lewis, and takes him to the future (this happens to be his son in the future) to correct the damage Goob has made to the present (Goob possesses a hat machine that can do anything, this hat stops Lewis invention from working in the present, then changing the future). These hat machines take over the world.In the future he meets his wacky, crazy family (of which some members live in the present with him). He also meets himself.After being brought back from the future, Lewis goes to Goob's baseball game, wakes him up so he can catch the fly ball. Goob does not turn evil. Lewis' s invention works and the future is corrected.The plot is convoluted, well beyond the comprehension of the audience for which the movie was intended (perhaps why it got bad reviews.)

1083485,AZCDCO6KK2T81,B000ROAK2W,"Steven Hedge ""Movie Fan""","[2, 3]","I was very leary of this film as I knew it was Disney's first CGI film since its split with Pixar AND that they were going with the 3-D gimmick that always disappointed me whenever I went to see them, but I'm thrilled to report that ALL of my concerns were for naught as this film is terrific fun, cleverly done, and used the absolute best 3-D effects I have ever seen in a film.The story is rather simple in that a nerdy, orphaned boy who wants to be a great inventor is constantly rejected by every parent that interviews for his adoption and decides to forgo anymore rejections, accepts his place as an orphan, but build a machine that will allow him to see or at least remember his mother when he learns that she may have given him up not because she didn't love him, but because she did and wanted him to have a better life than she might have been able to give him.  Telling you anything else would make this review a spoiler, so I'll stop here on the plot.The characters are all engaging and fun, including the villain who is something like the Wylie Coyote of the old Road Runner cartoons in that he can't get anything right in his attempts to harm our hero and his attempts are side-splittingly hilarious at times.  The rest of this film does lack the humor, fun, and fast pace we have grown accustomed to with Disney's Pixar films, but for Disney's first CGI film without Pixar, they did do well enough.The 3-D effects are spectacular and mind-bending.  I've never seen anything like them on screen before.  For starters, they are not the blue and green cardboard glasses that greatly distort the entire color of a film as in ""Spy Kids 3"" and while they are of the polorized lens type, they do not darken the film as pervious ones did and nor do they give you a headache which was another of the problems with polorized lens 3-D films as with ""Friday the 13th 3-D"".  There must be something about the third film in a series where they feel that have to get our attention with an old gimmick like 3-D, hence, my disappointment with that gimminck and my reluctance to see this Disney film at first.  I'm not sure what Disney did to enhance the 3-D quality of this film's format to actually make it comfortable to watch but I would swear on a stack of Bibles that instead of watching a picture screen, I was watching a window into another world.This film is truly ground-breaking stuff and the story's timeless themes of love, forgiveness, and fortitude make this a family film to enjoy even without the 3-D format.  I'd give this film 5 stars if the dialogue and story contained a bit more humor and moved along at a better pace.

I wasn't particularly interested in it, but, being a Disney fan, I naturally felt compelled to see it at least once.Once I saw it, I couldn't stop thinking about it. After sending it back to Netflix, I found myself watching the movie over and over again on YouTube until I was finally gifted it a couple Christmases later.Needless to say, I still love the movie! It is a wonderfully fast-paced and entertaining comedy/adventure/sci-fi/drama piece that went largely unnoticed upon its original release. Disney has given us a fairly unique film, at least compared to others in its canon; there are no show-stopping songs or sweeping love stories. Rather, it is an engaging adventure through time that keeps you guessing and drops some nice surprises along the way (big plot twists at the end!). I'm not going to spoil anything, but it is a very enjoyable movie that really deserves a viewing. Disney really does a great job of telling an entertaining and often moving story.

Not that I thought it looked terrible, I'm just skepticle of any CG movie that isn't Pixar.  This movie actually helped to restore my faith in Disney a little, that they can still produce funny, adventurous, animated movies with a message.I don't want to give too much away here because, like most movies, part of the fun for me is going in not knowing anything.  But basically it's about a kid looking to get adopted and growing up in an orphanage.  After getting rejected time and time again, he puts all his effort into his inventions which leads to him finding a family who he for the first time in his life actually fits in with.  However it's not what it seems.There are a lot of elements from other movies borrowed in here.  Star Wars, Jurassic Park and The Matrix especially all get a few scenes ripped from them.  The movie it ""borrows"" the most heavily from though is Back to the Future.  Which in a sense isn't a bad thing because I love those movies, but I have to knock it down a point for lack of originality.  Otherwise it's a pretty well put together movie with a decent cast of voice talent, (no big names for a welcome change), and it actually made me feel compassion and sadness for our orphaned protagonist, not always an easy feat in animation.Honestly, an overall good movie.  The part where he first meets the Robinsons though is the weirdest, trippiest scene in the movie so be warned.  I almost gave up on it by that point because nothing made sense but as you continue to watch, all will be explained...kinda.

While the goal is to attract customers to purchase the high-definition formats, those who are steadfastly sticking to DVD will be discouraged and may not buy the film at all, realizing that they're missing features. This is exactly the case with Meet the Robinsons on DVD, which loses extra deleted scenes and a ""Bowler Hat Barrage"" game exclusive to Blu-Ray.The regular DVD has an abridged selection of deleted scenes with an interesting new feature in which the director explains why each segment got cut with an on-camera explanation. The three fully animated sequences are ""Arriving in the Future"", ""Meeting Carl"", and ""Bowler Hat Guy's Redemption"".A short featurette called ""Keep Moving Forward: Inventions that Shaped the World"" introduces us to real-life inventors and visionaries (of course including Walt Disney) who changed the world with their mind-boggling creations and ideas.

Unfortunately, Lewis' keen interest in science and technology and overactive imagination seems too unusual for interested parents. When Lewis realizes that the only person who ever loved Lewis for just being himself was his mother. He decides to invent a device that will allow someone to visually see images of their memories on a monitor. Lewis enthusiasm is contagious, but also causes problems. First there is his roommate Michael &#34;Goob&#34; Yagoobian. Goob's biggest dream in life is to play baseball, but because of Lewis' late night work on his inventions, he rarely gets any sleep and causes all kinds of errors on his baseball team. At the school science fair that Lewis intends to introduce his memory-projection machine at, Lewis discovers that he's being followed by weird dark-haired boy named Wilbur Robinson who says he's from the future, as well as by a gangly mustached man in a bowler hat. Things become even more complicated when Wilbur takes Lewis to the future with him to prove he's speaking the truth. Wilbur lives with one of the most eccentric, fun-loving, and enduring families ever. Wilbur's mother teaches frogs to sing and play musical instruments, his grandmother likes to dance, one of his uncles is married to a puppet, etc. Despite their various oddities and unusual behaviors, the Robinsons are an extremely loving family that find in Lewis a kindred spirit and soon find themselves trying to adopt them into their family. However, Wilbur knows something about Lewis that no one else does. It's paramount that he returns to his own time and get his invention working and all along the Bowler Hat man is trying to alter time according to his whims and the advice of his mechanical hat Doris.MEET THE ROBINSONS was a better movie than I thought it was going to be. The animation is spectacular and full of vibrant colors that will especially appeal to the youngest of film goers. The movie has a positive message about accepting yourself for who you are, not letting failures keep one down, and to keep looking forward. Most of the characters in the film are really likeable, including the misguided &#34;bad guy&#34; The Bowler Hat Man.Yet, MEET THE ROBINSONS could have been a better movie. The Robinson family is full of interesting people, but the audience isn't given a chance to get to know any of the Robinson family members beyond an initial acquaintance. It would have been nice to get to know these characters better. I have a sneaky suspicion that that might still happen because in many ways MEET THE ROBINSONS comes off as being a great introduction to an animated series or a possible sequel of films. Whether that happens or not, it still would have been nice to see the characters on screen more. Besides, since the movie is so short, the filmmakers could have made it a little longer and more interestingThough the movie suffers from a lack of character development, MEET THE ROBINSONS is a fairly decent movie that families (especially those with younger children) will probably enjoy watching together.",3,A Crazy Fun-loving Future Family,1177200000,"04 22, 2007",2007,3189,"['Young', 'Lewis', 'curious', 'eccentric', 'orphan', 'boy', 'who', 'be', 'adopted', 'loved', 'family', 'will', 'accept', 'who', 'Unfortunately', 'Lewis', 'keen', 'interest', 'science', 'technology', 'overactive', 'imagination', 'too', 'unusual', 'interested', 'parents', 'When', 'Lewis', 'only', 'person', 'who', 'ever', 'loved', 'Lewis', 'just', 'being', 'was', 'mother', 'invent', 'device', 'will', 'allow', 'someone', 'visually', 'see', 'images', 'memories', 'monitor', 'Lewis', 'enthusiasm', 'contagious', 'also', 'problems', 'First', 'roommate', 'Michael', '34', 'Goob', '34', 'Yagoobian', 'Goob', 'biggest', 'dream', 'life', 'play', 'baseball', 'Lewis', 'late', 'night', 'work', 'inventions', 'rarely', 'sleep', 'kinds', 'errors', 'baseball', 'team', 'school', 'science', 'fair', 'Lewis', 'introduce', 'memory-projection', 'machine', 'Lewis', 'being', 'followed', 'weird', 'dark-haired', 'boy', 'named', 'Wilbur', 'Robinson', 'who', 'future', 'as', 'well', 'gangly', 'mustached', 'man', 'bowler', 'hat', 'become', 'even', 'more', 'complicated', 'when', 'Wilbur', 'Lewis', 'future', 'prove', 'speaking', 'truth', 'Wilbur', 'one', 'most', 'eccentric', 'fun-loving', 'enduring', 'families', 'ever', 'Wilbur', 'mother', 'teaches', 'frogs', 'sing', 'play', 'musical', 'instruments', 'grandmother', 'likes', 'dance', 'one', 'uncles', 'married', 'puppet', 'etc', 'various', 'oddities', 'unusual', 'behaviors', 'Robinsons', 'are', 'extremely', 'loving', 'family', 'find', 'Lewis', 'kindred', 'spirit', 'soon', 'find', 'trying', 'adopt', 'family', 'However', 'Wilbur', 'something', 'Lewis', 'one', 'else', 'paramount', 'own', 'time', 'get', 'invention', 'working', 'Bowler', 'Hat', 'man', 'trying', 'alter', 'time', 'according', 'whims', 'advice', 'mechanical', 'hat', 'Doris.MEET', 'THE', 'ROBINSONS', 'was', 'better', 'movie', 'thought', 'was', 'going', 'be', 'animation', 'spectacular', 'full', 'vibrant', 'colors', 'will', 'especially', 'appeal', 'youngest', 'film', 'goers', 'movie', 'positive', 'message', 'accepting', 'who', 'are', 'not', 'letting', 'failures', 'keep', 'one', 'down', 'keep', 'looking', 'forward', 'Most', 'characters', 'film', 'are', 'really', 'likeable', 'including', 'misguided', '34', 'bad', 'guy', '34', 'Bowler', 'Hat', 'Man.Yet', 'MEET', 'THE', 'ROBINSONS', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'better', 'movie', 'Robinson', 'family', 'full', 'interesting', 'people', 'audience', ""n't"", 'given', 'chance', 'get', 'know', 'Robinson', 'family', 'members', 'initial', 'acquaintance', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'nice', 'get', 'know', 'characters', 'better', 'have', 'sneaky', 'suspicion', 'might', 'still', 'happen', 'many', 'ways', 'MEET', 'THE', 'ROBINSONS', 'off', 'being', 'great', 'introduction', 'animated', 'series', 'possible', 'sequel', 'films', 'not', 'still', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'nice', 'see', 'characters', 'screen', 'more', 'movie', 'so', 'short', 'filmmakers', 'could', 'have', 'made', 'little', 'longer', 'more', 'movie', 'suffers', 'lack', 'character', 'development', 'MEET', 'THE', 'ROBINSONS', 'fairly', 'decent', 'movie', 'families', 'especially', 'younger', 'children', 'will', 'probably', 'enjoy', 'watching', 'together']",N/A

""Dinosaur"" was boringly derivative and numbingly dull, and ""Chicken Little"" was a good idea poorly handled. With ""Meet the Robinsons"", Disney started finding its way (though with some help with John Lassiter). The story is a broad expansion of a picture book (which I haven't read), and owes a great deal to ""You Can't Take it With You"", the Robinsons being a futuristic version of the Sycamores.Some viewers might find this off-putting. The Robinsons are so unconventional, and the film spends so much time introducing us to them -- and their quirks -- that you might find yourself simultaneously bored and annoyed. But stick with it, because ""Meet the Robinsons"" has a few twists up its sleeve. (The identity of Mr Robinson /isn't/ one of them. It's obvious, and not intended to be a surprise.)The story has a ""moral"", of course -- that, in the context of progress, failure is a natural component, and to be expected.The PG rating is mostly for ""scary moments"". I urge parents with ""sensitive"" children to view it first. ""Doris"" -- who resembles a monster in the original ""Not of This Earth"" -- could cause some youngsters to wet themselves.Recommended, if you want something a bit different from the usual kiddie fare.",4,A really oddball film...,1298764800,"02 27, 2011",2011,1285,"['Disney', 'first', 'forays', 'digital', 'animation', 'were', ""n't"", 'very', 'good', 'Dinosaur', 'was', 'boringly', 'derivative', 'numbingly', 'dull', 'Chicken', 'Little', 'was', 'good', 'idea', 'poorly', 'handled', 'Meet', 'Robinsons', 'Disney', 'started', 'finding', 'way', 'help', 'John', 'Lassiter', 'story', 'broad', 'expansion', 'picture', 'book', 'have', ""n't"", 'read', 'great', 'deal', 'Ca', ""n't"", 'Take', 'Robinsons', 'being', 'futuristic', 'version', 'Sycamores.Some', 'viewers', 'might', 'find', 'off-putting', 'Robinsons', 'are', 'so', 'unconventional', 'film', 'so', 'much', 'time', 'introducing', 'quirks', 'might', 'find', 'simultaneously', 'bored', 'annoyed', 'stick', 'Meet', 'Robinsons', 'few', 'up', 'sleeve', 'identity', 'Mr', 'Robinson', ""/isn't/"", 'one', 'obvious', 'not', 'intended', 'be', 'surprise', 'story', 'moral', 'course', 'context', 'progress', 'failure', 'natural', 'component', 'be', 'expected.The', 'PG', 'rating', 'mostly', 'scary', 'moments', 'urge', 'parents', 'sensitive', 'children', 'view', 'first', 'Doris', 'who', 'monster', 'original', 'Not', 'Earth', 'could', 'cause', 'youngsters', 'wet', 'themselves.Recommended', 'want', 'something', 'bit', 'different', 'usual', 'kiddie', 'fare']",N/A
