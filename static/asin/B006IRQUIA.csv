Writers of today's television shows should take lessons from the writers of Matlock. This is a truly down home type of show that really appeals to family values.  I enjoy watching Ben's interactions with the other characters and the way he solves cases in his ""gruff"" manner.  If I have any disappointments they are that the character Michelle Thomas disappeared at the end of season 6 and that Julie Marsh, Ben's love interest and ADA was also written out of the series.

The seventh season also the first appearance of Cliff Lewis portrayed by actor Daniel Roebuck, which had appeared in previous episodes as other characters as did Thayer.  This like other previous Matlock packages has superior acting & direction of episodes and yes just like Thayer & Roebuck both who appeared as other characters in previous seasons, you will also see others such as Randy Travis.  Just as with TAGS, Matlock does have a musical flare whenever possible.  You cannot go wrong with this set or any of the Matlock sets for that matter.

She's accused of his murder and believes she was responsible for his death.  His ghost wants Ben to defend her!

In &#34;The Debt&#34;, she defends her ex and in the process, learns her Dad was right - he's a bum!Conrad McMasters (4), Ben's investigator.  In &#34;The Final Affair&#34;, he gets to sing in the church choir.Cliff Lewis (4).  In &#34;The Vacation&#34;, he tried to trick Ben into hiring him, but ended up needing Ben to defend him.Billy Lewis (2), Cliff's father.
