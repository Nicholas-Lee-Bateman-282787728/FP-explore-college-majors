The episode titles are as follows:1. Fallen Part 12. Fallen Part 2  -- Fallen was originally a 2 part movie event.  Parts 1 and 2 were produced in 2006.3. The Time of the Redeemer  -- first episode of the miniseries -- this episode and all future ones were made in 2007.4. Mysterious Ways And All That5. Someone Always Has To Die6. Il Gran RifulitoI got tired of waiting for Fallen DVDs to come out, bought the episodes on iTunes Store, synced to a video iPod, connected video iPod to TV and recorded each episode to VHS then dubbed to DVD using my VCR DVD Recorder. Quality may not be as great as on any commercially available DVDs but at least I have a DVD of the series. In fact I have all 6 episodes on one disc. The 1 disc compilation releases being made though only have 2 or 3 episodes. I'd like to own the actual Fallen DVDs some day when the complete trilogy is out with bonus features and stuff and to be able to play them even in my computer to watch, This is a fantastic mini series -- even now the entire trilogy does not appear to be on DVD. From what I've heard its only the first 2 or 3 episodes. Will wait and maybe someday get the commercial DVDs when I feel the entire saga is released to DVD.

1332491,A21IIROYHZV7VO,B0038MUZ3E,BlackDragon,"[7, 8]","Based on the FALLEN books (eg. Fallen, Leviathan, Aerie & Reckoning) written by Thomas Sniegoski . . . unfortunately (as with most movies) it doesn't follow the true path in the books. Personally I found the books to be far better. The movie was good in its own way, but I like the way the book ended better than the movie.Originally an ABC family mini-series, which was first aired in 2006 (The Time of the Redemer) and followed with additional episodes in the summer of 2007 (Mysterious Ways and All That, Someone Always Has to Die and Il Gran Rifiuto aka the Grand Refusal).The movie introduces us to Aaron Corbett . . . a Nephilim . . . the offspring of an angel and mortal woman. Hunted by the Powers leader Verchiel (a woman in the movie), Aaron is informed by a Fallen Angel of his TRUE nature. Of course he is in denial, but events slowly unfold as his angelic powers start rising to the surface. When Verchiel goes to his home she's hell bent on anniliating him, but after blasting him into fire he walks out, his angelic nature surfaces and he battles with her. He is then forced to flee home with the angel Camael and his dog Gabriel, he leaves all his loved ones behind.A prophecy foretold  "" . . . in the footsteps of his father, in the sign of Virgo, a Redeemer will be born. His hands will deliver fair judgement. Ye will know him by his markings, names on his flesh reveal his mercy. The Redeemer shall judge what the Fallen have done and bring the Fallen to ascension and glory one more. Many shall seek him. Those meaning to destroy him will guide him to his fate. Again all of the damned or Fallen shall know Paradise, once again the Fallen will have time to make right where they went wrong.""During an encounter with the Powers Camael is wounded. They search for the angel Ariel, who is a gifted healer. Aaron visits a college campus and learns more about the stories of angels and the Fallen from a professor. The professor takes Aaron to his home to show him proof . . . Aaron sees Vilma, a girl he knew in high school . . . she is a Nephilim too.After rescuing Vilma, the Powers are hot on his trail, now lead by Mazarin  they continue to hunt him down. Camael tells Aaron and Vilma to flee, and he is captured by the Powers. Another fierce Fallan warrior angel by the name of Azazel joins Aaron, Vilma and Gabriel. Azazel lies, and tells Aaron that Camael is dead. He promises to take Aaron to the Light Bringer, the oracle who wrote the prophecy and who would be able to tell Aaron WHO his angelic father is.Unfortunately this mini series stirred up alot of controversy (not too surprising), as some folks fail to realize this is a work of FICTION and a MOVIE (not a documentary). Some religious folks are probably offended because this story does not follow the Bible . . . hello,  this is ""fantasy"" all things go, it does NOT have to follow the Bible. Seriously, I think the movie portrayed LUCIFER as the BAD guy (as do most religious writings), if the movie had followed the BOOKS, then religious folks would REALLY be offended . . . the books are far more graphic and violent and portray the first of the Fallen, Lucifer, as a person you feel sorry for . . . anyhow, just enjoy the movie for what it IS . . . a wonderful story with nice special effects. I thought it was AWESOME!

Then on his 18'th birthday everything changes; hidden powers emerge and he learns the terrifying truth that he is a Nephelim. A Nephelim is a cross between a fallen angel and a human and is considered an abomination by the Powers (Gods angels). He will be hunted down and destroyed unless he accepts his destiny as the Redeemer, the prophesied Nephelim who is the savior to the fallen angels.The movie series centers around him finding out, accepting, and surviving to fulfill his destiny. The movie is interesting and well done. While it does take liberties from the best selling book series it's still well done and will keep you interest.The acting is excellent though at times overdone. I loved the character of Gabriel the Labrador but I wish his voice hadn't seemed so contrived. The special effects were overall well done and I especially liked that they didn't over do the flaming swords.I didn't give this a 5 star rating because while there are shows on TV that come off feeling more like a movie this definitely has a Made-for-TV feel.",4,Worth adding to your collection.,1272153600,"04 25, 2010",2010,1265,"['Aaron', 'Corbett', 'Paul', 'Wesley', 'Vampire', 'Diaries', 'orphan', 'who', 'found', 'loving', 'home', 'got', 'great', 'life', 'supportive', 'family', 'jock', 'smart', 'basically', 'can', 'write', 'ticket', 'college', 'Then', ""18'th"", 'birthday', 'everything', 'changes', 'hidden', 'powers', 'emerge', 'terrifying', 'truth', 'Nephelim', 'Nephelim', 'cross', 'fallen', 'angel', 'human', 'considered', 'abomination', 'Powers', 'Gods', 'angels', 'will', 'be', 'hunted', 'down', 'destroyed', 'destiny', 'Redeemer', 'prophesied', 'Nephelim', 'who', 'savior', 'fallen', 'angels.The', 'movie', 'series', 'centers', 'finding', 'out', 'accepting', 'surviving', 'fulfill', 'destiny', 'movie', 'interesting', 'well', 'done', 'take', 'liberties', 'best', 'selling', 'book', 'series', 'still', 'well', 'done', 'will', 'keep', 'interest.The', 'acting', 'excellent', 'though', 'times', 'overdone', 'loved', 'character', 'Gabriel', 'Labrador', 'wish', 'voice', 'had', ""n't"", 'seemed', 'so', 'contrived', 'special', 'effects', 'were', 'overall', 'well', 'done', 'especially', 'liked', 'did', ""n't"", 'over', 'do', 'flaming', 'swords.I', 'did', ""n't"", 'give', '5', 'star', 'rating', 'are', 'shows', 'TV', 'come', 'off', 'feeling', 'more', 'movie', 'definitely', 'Made-for-TV', 'feel']",N/A

It stars Paul Wesley, Who is now on the CW's Vampire Diaries, As a supposedly normal teen and orphaned at an early age when he is adopted into a very nice family that has an autistic son. On his 18th birthday when most teenagers would get a car or a great party he gets Wings, As in ANGEL Wings!Now MY review...I was THRILLED to see something so different on TV especially when it has religion in it. Most Networks and well EVERYONE avoid Religion and Politics even if it IS Fiction. I was really hoping that this would have been a actual SHOW and not Just a Mini-Movie. That said I WAS Really Happy with what they did in telling his story BUT they did leave a cliff-hanger. So It is possible to get MORE someday.
