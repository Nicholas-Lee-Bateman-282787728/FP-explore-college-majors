147274,A1MM6PU8E3VZ5L,0792841913,"A. Nathaniel Wallace, Jr. ""Nosidino""","[1, 1]","I just finished this DVD on last night and all I can say is--wow! For years I'd wanted to see this movie and I finally got the chance when I randomly slected it from my unseen DVD selection.Peter Fonda gives one of his best performances ever in this low-key tale of a simple man drawn into big and dangerous circumstances. When I enjoy a movie I have to like the character(s) or be faced with a larger than life hero or circumstances. In this case it is the former. The story holds up quite well when you consider it is more than 15-years old.Ulee Jackson is a man holding his family together after several tragedies. The death of his wife, the incarceration of his son, and the drug-addicted illness of his daughter in law. Add to this the responsibility he has for his granddaughters, and Ulee has a full plate. Unfortunately he is forced into circumstances he never would have realized when his son asks him to retrieve his wife, who has been doped up by two tough thugs. The story progresses with Ulee having to locate the money from an armoured car heist that was pulled off by the thugs in conjunction with his son; dealing with these sundry problems, along with finding the money are what drives this plot.This small, independent film really works on so many levels that I can't go into all of the details. I will say this, however: So good was Fonda's performance that it should have won him an Academy Award. The film is well-acted on all fronts, each actor more than doing their job. Buy this movie on DVD and you won't be disappointed. My only quibble was some rough edges on some of the cinematography. I noticed blurry images in several of the night scenes. These could have been fixed with either better lighting, better observations from the TV monitor on set and/or better editing and reshoots. Despite this, the movie still gets Four Stars from me.A.

147275,A2CW9IQAPFEYLM,0792841913,Bomojaz,"[4, 4]","Peter Fonda is superb as the bitter, we-don't-need-anybody's-help family head who raises bees in Florida for a living, and must suddenly deal with a daughter-in-law (played by Christine Dunford) strung out on drugs and a son (Tom Wood) who's in prison on robbery charges. A couple of ex-con buddies of Wood learn that he hid away a lot of the money from the robbery they committed, and they make it plain to Fonda that they want it. Fonda's got to figure out how to deal with these two ex-cons while trying to detox Dunford at home - and still get the honey collected from his beekeeping operation.Fonda plays Ulee Jackson like a man with the DNA of a turtle: all his on-screen actions are slow and deliberate - even his incessant handling of his glasses seems to eat up much screen time. His character is supposed to be the ultimate stoic, and he plays it to the hilt. But the story is an interesting one, and the climax in the swamp is pretty exciting. The director (Victor Nunez) also insists on showing as much of the beekeeping tasks as he can get away with (some of it is so detailed it could be used in a beekeepers documentary); you will either not mind this very much or be driven crazy by it. I didn't mind it very much. Fonda is actually pretty fascinating to watch; his performance is right out of the old method school of acting (he IS Ulee and not just playing a role). The movie works and is satisfying to watch.",4,Peter Fonda is excellent,1163203200,"11 11, 2006",2006,1427,"['Peter', 'Fonda', 'superb', 'bitter', ""we-don't-need-anybody's-help"", 'family', 'head', 'who', 'bees', 'Florida', 'living', 'must', 'suddenly', 'deal', 'daughter-in-law', 'played', 'Christine', 'Dunford', 'strung', 'out', 'drugs', 'son', 'Tom', 'Wood', 'who', 'prison', 'robbery', 'charges', 'couple', 'ex-con', 'buddies', 'Wood', 'learn', 'away', 'lot', 'money', 'robbery', 'committed', 'make', 'plain', 'Fonda', 'want', 'Fonda', 'got', 'figure', 'out', 'how', 'deal', 'two', 'ex-cons', 'trying', 'detox', 'Dunford', 'home', 'still', 'get', 'honey', 'collected', 'beekeeping', 'operation.Fonda', 'plays', 'Ulee', 'Jackson', 'man', 'DNA', 'turtle', 'on-screen', 'actions', 'are', 'slow', 'deliberate', 'even', 'incessant', 'handling', 'glasses', 'eat', 'up', 'much', 'screen', 'time', 'character', 'supposed', 'be', 'ultimate', 'stoic', 'hilt', 'story', 'interesting', 'one', 'climax', 'swamp', 'pretty', 'exciting', 'director', 'Victor', 'Nunez', 'also', 'showing', 'much', 'beekeeping', 'tasks', 'can', 'get', 'away', 'so', 'detailed', 'could', 'be', 'used', 'beekeepers', 'documentary', 'will', 'either', 'not', 'mind', 'very', 'much', 'be', 'driven', 'crazy', 'did', ""n't"", 'mind', 'very', 'much', 'Fonda', 'actually', 'pretty', 'fascinating', 'watch', 'performance', 'right', 'old', 'method', 'school', 'acting', 'Ulee', 'not', 'just', 'playing', 'role', 'movie', 'works', 'satisfying', 'watch']",N/A

147277,A30N4CJVI6U4XE,0792841913,"Chris Wilson ""Chris Kent""","[0, 0]","Multiple factors come together to make ""Ulee's Gold"" a great film. First and foremost is the extraordinary performance of Peter Fonda. It was trendy when the film was released in 1997 to trumpet Peter's resemblance to father Henry, but I'm not sure even his dad could have played this role with such subtlety and skill. I think the supporting performances are equally strong, all the way down to the sheriff played by J. Kenneth Campbell.The on-location shooting in Florida further adds shades to the everyday proceedings. I love films that take you to unique locales and introduce you to characters inhabiting those spaces. ""Ulee's Gold"" takes us to the world of rural Florida and quietly details the occasionally ugly dramas of everyday people. Victor Nunez, the enormously talented writer/director, was raised in Florida and the detail of a life spent there comes through.In a small town in the Florida panhandle, a recently widowed beekeeper (Fonda) goes about his daily chores while trying to raise two granddaughters. He drives a beat up truck around town, buys groceries alone and minds his business. His incarcerated son calls from prison and informs him that his wife (Christine Dunford) is in nearby Tampa and needs to be rescued. She's been missing in action for the last year and is now essentially in the throes of drug addiction while living in beat-up motels. Ulee reluctantly makes the long drive to fetch his daughter-in-law and finds her being kept by two hoodlums. He brings her home, where her daughters must witness first-hand the hideous days of withdrawal. A divorced neighbor Connie (Patricia Richardson), who's a nurse, assists Ulee with the difficult supervision. In the meantime, it's honey season, and Ulee goes about his chores with little sleep in the dead of night, finding time to take naps on the hardwood floor because of a bad back. Turns out the hoodlums robbed a bank with Ulee's son and learned of hidden money. They will soon pay a visit to his home.The essential core of ""Ulee's Gold"" is the painful attempts of a modest yet noble man to hold the ragged remnants of his family together. He has a difficult teenage granddaughter (Jessica Biel in her debut role) in the throes of hormone struggle and rebellion (""You'll pay for the rest of your life for being a jackass!""). The youngest granddaughter Penny (Vanessa Zima), has yet to be corrupted by life's darkness. Ulee attempts to protect her, bringing her along one afternoon to assist with his beekeeping chores.There's also a growing, quiet attraction, between Ulee and Connie, and they discuss the frustrations of their lives during a brilliant scene one morning over tea at the breakfast table. Through it all, Fonda's Ulee stands firm through the pains and difficulties of a man far past middle age. His hair is graying, he gingerly puts on his spectacles and limps from humble home to work to can jars and barrels of honey so his family can survive.What I love about ""Ulee's Gold"" is its quiet nature. This is a film driven by character rather than action. These are instantly identifiable people - human, flawed, making the best of lives of disappointment. ""Ulee's Gold"" is inspirational because these characters are us, performing small, difficult actions to make things right, if not bearable. Even when the hoodlums arrive, the thrust of the drama does not go where you expect, and yet the way it plays out feels like life - dumb decisions, tactful maneuvers, quiet decency influencing all.""Ulee's Gold"" is not only the greatest film of Peter Fonda's career, it is one of the greatest films of the decade of the 1990s. It's a perfect example of film-making becoming art, where a cracked vase of flowers possesses the beauty of the universe.",5,Quietly details the dramas of everyday people...,1259971200,"12 5, 2009",2009,3742,"['Multiple', 'factors', 'come', 'together', 'make', 'Ulee', 'Gold', 'great', 'film', 'First', 'foremost', 'extraordinary', 'performance', 'Peter', 'Fonda', 'was', 'trendy', 'when', 'film', 'was', 'released', '1997', 'trumpet', 'Peter', 'resemblance', 'father', 'Henry', ""'m"", 'not', 'sure', 'even', 'dad', 'could', 'have', 'played', 'role', 'such', 'subtlety', 'skill', 'think', 'supporting', 'performances', 'are', 'equally', 'strong', 'way', 'sheriff', 'played', 'J.', 'Kenneth', 'Campbell.The', 'on-location', 'shooting', 'Florida', 'further', 'shades', 'everyday', 'proceedings', 'love', 'films', 'take', 'unique', 'locales', 'introduce', 'characters', 'inhabiting', 'spaces', 'Ulee', 'Gold', 'world', 'rural', 'Florida', 'quietly', 'details', 'occasionally', 'ugly', 'dramas', 'everyday', 'people', 'Victor', 'Nunez', 'enormously', 'talented', 'writer/director', 'was', 'raised', 'Florida', 'detail', 'life', 'spent', 'there', 'through.In', 'small', 'town', 'Florida', 'panhandle', 'recently', 'widowed', 'beekeeper', 'Fonda', 'daily', 'chores', 'trying', 'raise', 'two', 'granddaughters', 'beat', 'up', 'truck', 'town', 'buys', 'groceries', 'alone', 'business', 'incarcerated', 'son', 'prison', 'wife', 'Christine', 'Dunford', 'nearby', 'Tampa', 'be', 'rescued', 'been', 'missing', 'action', 'last', 'year', 'now', 'essentially', 'throes', 'drug', 'addiction', 'living', 'beat-up', 'motels', 'Ulee', 'reluctantly', 'long', 'drive', 'fetch', 'daughter-in-law', 'being', 'kept', 'two', 'hoodlums', 'home', 'where', 'daughters', 'must', 'witness', 'first-hand', 'hideous', 'days', 'withdrawal', 'divorced', 'neighbor', 'Connie', 'Patricia', 'Richardson', 'who', 'nurse', 'Ulee', 'difficult', 'supervision', 'meantime', 'honey', 'season', 'Ulee', 'chores', 'little', 'sleep', 'dead', 'night', 'finding', 'time', 'take', 'naps', 'hardwood', 'floor', 'bad', 'back', 'out', 'hoodlums', 'robbed', 'bank', 'Ulee', 'son', 'learned', 'hidden', 'money', 'will', 'soon', 'pay', 'visit', 'home.The', 'essential', 'core', 'Ulee', 'Gold', 'painful', 'attempts', 'modest', 'yet', 'noble', 'man', 'hold', 'ragged', 'remnants', 'family', 'together', 'difficult', 'teenage', 'granddaughter', 'Jessica', 'Biel', 'debut', 'role', 'throes', 'hormone', 'struggle', 'rebellion', ""'ll"", 'pay', 'rest', 'life', 'being', 'jackass', 'youngest', 'granddaughter', 'Penny', 'Vanessa', 'Zima', 'yet', 'be', 'corrupted', 'life', 'darkness', 'Ulee', 'protect', 'bringing', 'one', 'afternoon', 'assist', 'beekeeping', 'chores.There', 'also', 'growing', 'quiet', 'attraction', 'Ulee', 'Connie', 'discuss', 'frustrations', 'lives', 'brilliant', 'scene', 'one', 'morning', 'tea', 'breakfast', 'table', 'Fonda', 'Ulee', 'firm', 'pains', 'difficulties', 'man', 'far', 'past', 'middle', 'age', 'hair', 'graying', 'gingerly', 'spectacles', 'limps', 'humble', 'home', 'work', 'can', 'jars', 'barrels', 'honey', 'family', 'can', 'survive.What', 'love', 'Ulee', 'Gold', 'quiet', 'nature', 'film', 'driven', 'character', 'rather', 'action', 'are', 'instantly', 'identifiable', 'people', 'human', 'flawed', 'making', 'best', 'lives', 'disappointment', 'Ulee', 'Gold', 'inspirational', 'characters', 'are', 'performing', 'small', 'difficult', 'actions', 'make', 'things', 'right', 'not', 'bearable', 'Even', 'when', 'hoodlums', 'arrive', 'thrust', 'drama', 'not', 'go', 'where', 'expect', 'yet', 'way', 'out', 'feels', 'life', 'dumb', 'decisions', 'tactful', 'maneuvers', 'quiet', 'decency', 'influencing', 'Ulee', 'Gold', 'not', 'only', 'greatest', 'film', 'Peter', 'Fonda', 'career', 'one', 'greatest', 'films', 'decade', '1990s', 'perfect', 'example', 'film-making', 'becoming', 'art', 'where', 'cracked', 'vase', 'flowers', 'possesses', 'beauty', 'universe']",N/A
147278,A35K84RT618N3A,0792841913,David Robson,"[4, 5]","Ulee's Gold is a genuinely enjoyable gem with a plot as simple as pie. Screenwriter and director Victor Nunez (formerly of Ruby in Paradise) slowly and methodically piles moment upon moment and builds a fantastic  story of a troubled family. Ulee himself has lost much: buddies in 'Nam,  his wife Penelope (a nod to another less animated Greek named Homer), and a  grown son to the penal system. Stuck with the two grandkids, he's making  his honey as a beekeeper. It's the one thing he can count on.When thugs  threaten his less than happy abode, Ulee must deliver the whereabouts of a  load of money or lose the little he does have. Thrown into the mix is a  nurse neighbor played by Patricia Richardson (I guess she ditched Tim  Allen). She helps the clan through a daughter in laws drug-addiction and  becomes a rock for Ulee to depend on.The central performance though is  Fonda's. He'll never be a great actor--he delivers his lines way too  flatly--but in his own low-key way he evokes a gentle spirit that is  nothing short of irresistable to watch. A lot has already been made his  resemblance to his pops Henry. Yeah? Well duh! I also saw a whole bunch of  Eastwood in Ulee Jackson's languid gait and well-deep stare.All in all,  Ulee's Gold isn't easily forgotten; each of its characters let the feelings  flow like the Tupelo honey that sustains the them.

Hernandez ""Call me Harry""","[0, 0]","Ah, I cannot add much here except deeply personal feelings.This film, a sort of auto-pilot performance by Fonda that still fetched him an Oscar, is classic. Fonda had to do auto-pilot: his character required it.Fonda is a VietNam hero with a nice family business (bee farmer, specializes in Tupelo honey) and a not-so-nice family. He's raising his grand-daughters alone, since his wife is dead, his daughter-in-law is a druggie prostitute, and his son is serving time for strong-arm robbery. The older grand-daughter hates his guts, as does everyone else except his youngest grand-daughter. He seems let down by the fact that he may have to leave the business to her, and she's only 8 years old.The treasure-hunt-by-criminals unfolds as the storyline...but it is Fonda who actually catches gradual fire with this performance, as he shows some young ruffians what he learned in Nam, goes on an adventure to find ""buried"" treasure, makes up with his family and as a by-your-leave gets stabbed by the bad guys in the bargain (no...he survives it).This film hooked me on several things. It rekindled my love of Peter Fonda. It impressed me that it had little to do with Nam flashbacks or homilies. There's a quiet, desolate, desperate quality, which films have been copying since but can't quite get right. It has flawless peformances. Patricia Richardson (""Home Improvement"") makes a wide, impressive splash that I haven't seen anywhere else, and more's the pity. She has acting chops and zero dilettantism.A great and totally ignored beauty I see in ""Ulee's Gold"" is Lanier's Bee Farms, of Florida, where the film was mostly filmed...and they kindly allowed filming at their various bee yards.

His family includes a son in prison for bank robbery, a drugged out daughter-in-law who spills the beans about the location of the long-lost stolen money to the other accomplices who give Ulee trouble, and two grandaughters, aged about 11 and rebellious 15. There is a helpful neighbor nurse and local sheriff, as well. The End.Peter Fonda garnered much acclaim for his acting, and in fact all the players did a good job including Jessica Biel and Vanessa Zima as the kids, Patricia Richardson as the neighbor, and Tom Wood as the son.I found the actual bee-keeping business pretty interesting, but it looks to be a tedious and labor-intensive job, at least on the small-scale shown here.This story will only appeal to older audiences as there is little &quot;action&quot;, even in the action portion.

Victor Nunez is an independent filmmaker who usually sets his films in Florida and sits on the board of the Sundance Film Festival.  His excellent eye for talent is demonstrated by the introduction of Ashley Judd in 1993's ""Ruby in Paradise.""  Being an independent feature explains why so much of this cast is actors from television.  Not to diminish the sterling performance of Peter Fonda, this is an ensemble work that Nunez has directed.  Each member of the cast is essential to its success; and it does succeed.As Ulee Jackson, Peter Fonda gives an amazingly understated but strong performance.  You can see the storm of emotions that fly within the character as evidenced by the one scene where he lets his feelings fly as he tells off his daughter-in-law Helen with anger and venom.  That edge or spark underlies all of the other well-controlled scenes so that even though Ulee may be quiet, he is always focused, always tense.The supporting cast is also excellent.  TV's ""Home Improvement"" Patricia Richardson is excellent as the neighbor nurse who tries to help without intruding and winds up attracted to Ulee.  That interesting relationship allows the mind to conjure up Ulee 2: The Sequel to see how things develop after this crisis point.Jessica Biel, the bad girl who posed nude for a magazine and got booted from TV's ""7th Heaven"" delivers another blockbuster performance as the young adult/late adolescent who wants to be a kid but who fights with her responsibilities to her family and loves them even as she sasses them.  I probably won't select to see her in the upcoming ""Texas Chainsaw Massacre"" because it's not my kind of film, but she certainly shows the potential of an accomplished actress.The other supporting players are also excellent.  Christine Dunford who has worked in TV (Ally McBeal, Law & Order) shows great range as the drug-addicted mother who is dragged out of her habit, and clings to her con hubby.  Steven Flynn who also has worked in TV (Ally McBeal, NYPD Blue) as the big brain con Eddie Flowers is sufficiently creepy to keep our interest.  His horny sidekick Ferris Dooley is played well by Dewey Weber.  Ulee's son Jimmy in prison is played by Tom Wood (""The Fugitive,"" ""Appollo 13"") with an edgy performance, conflicting the loose morals that landed him in prison with his love for his wife and kids.  Even little Vanessa Zima (""Zoe"") as the younger daughter Penny does a good job of being sufficiently innocent.Nunez has created a marvelous ensemble piece.  One could almost see this adapted for a compelling stage play.  I was particularly struck by the metaphor of being calm amid the bees which paralells the tense human situation and Ulee's calmness in the face of possible tragedy.  The film holds up well and will remain a classic film.

147284,ASU3THM5ZUTUI,0792841913,"Mark Lee ""Peacemaker""","[3, 3]","Ulee Jackson (played by Peter Fonda) is a reclusive beekeeper who lives in a rustic home in a tiny Florida town, where he raises his two granddaughters.  As the victim of past hardships, he also is now the eldest member of a dysfunctional family; his son Jimmy is in prison, his daughter-in-law Helen is a runaway drug addict, his oldest granddaughter Casey is a rebellious teen, and her little sister Penny is a lonely young girl.  Ulee is a loner, refusing the help and camaraderie of the local townsfolk.  But one day, Jimmy calls Ulee and asks for a favor regarding Helen.  Ulee then discovers that, by mustering up tremendous lost courage, he must bring his shattered family together and keep them safe from a pair of thugs.Directed by Victor Nunez, this critically-acclaimed film wasn't seen much upon its 1997 release. ""Ulee's Gold"" is a very quiet film, and its unhurried pace and frequent dialogue will probably try the patience of just about anyone who watches it.  It takes its time before diving into the storyline, and the viewer doesn't really get involved with the film until after the first half-hour.  However, ""Ulee's Gold"" is ultimately a powerful and effective human drama that moves the soul in its own subtle way.The film's greatest strength lies in the stirring performances, particularly that of Peter Fonda as the aloof but strong-willed Ulee.  At first the viewer thinks of Ulee as just an estranged man who cares about nothing but his beekeeping business; but the character slowly works his way into the viewer's heart as the film progresses.  Soon we get to realize how much the man cares for his family, and by the end of the film we are really cheering for him.  Christine Dunford also gives a superb performance as Helen, and Patricia Richardson (of ""Home Improvement"" fame) is also convincing as Ulee's neighbor, the one townsperson whom he allows in on his situation.Additionally, much of the plot of ""Ulee's Gold"" lies in the script, rather than through on-screen action; thus the viewer is never presented with overcalculated brutality.  Even the tensest of scenes are played out like they would be in an everyday rural or suburban society, without big explosions or fistfights.  The drawn-out dialogue gets a little tedious at times, but it makes the characters all the more believable.  Throughout the film, these characters go through a lot of changes, especially Ulee.  In the end, it is Ulee who has changed the most, having discovered that his ""gold"" is not just his rare Tupelo honey, but the even-more-precious family that he has fought so hard to protect.""Ulee's Gold"" may not be quite as involving as the more recent ""In the Bedroom"", but it's a great film for anyone who likes solidly told dramas.  It was not aimed at a teenage audience, so anyone my age who happens to be reading this review will probably find it somewhat boring; however, there's a lot of good material in this film that shows profound thought in Nunez's part.

He is a man who comes off as born too late. The mists of moral relevatism burn off in the presence of this honest, though not simple man. Yet Ulee is closed. His heart seems to have been locked forever the moment his wife died and his son was sent to prison.Only when his son's former partners in crime confront Ulee does he begin to open up.

She gently kicks open the door of his heart by attempting to help him keep his family together and out of danger.There are few characters (either in film or literature) that are quite like Fonda's Ulee.

And despite the slow, steady pacing of this flick, that is exactly what it is--a re-defining of &quot;action&quot; films.  You doubt  it?  Just watch how many times Ulee finds himself in dangerous situations  demanding action--kidnappings, hostage situations, removing his overdosing  daughter-in-law from the drug den she has called home for far too long,  staring down the barrels of guns weilded by two lunatic sociopaths who  don't have two brain cells to rub together.  These are situations in which  somebody has to do something!  In other films that would have meant blood  and gore in a host of possible situations--shootings, explosions, car  crashes, or at the very least a bone-crunching karate kick or two.  Not  Ulee's style, so it doesn't happen, but in the end you realize that as  plodding and unpretentious as he is, Ulee is a man of action.  And  furthermore, he gets excellent results.If you insist that blood, gore  and violence are necessary components of an action film, you may not care  for this one.  However, if you are adventurous and want to see a whole new  spin on the theme--not to mention a chance to see Peter Fonda proving that  he is just as appealing as he ever was--by all means, see this film.

Good story about a grandfather who is a beekeeper and who lost his wife to illness is raising his grandchildren. His son is in prison for armed robbery and the children's mother is on drugs and living with the men her husband took the robbery rap to protect. What makes it unusual is that Peter Fonda is playing a man who is said to be a Vietnam war hero. What a stretch. It works for me in this film. I loved it.
