You see new buildings with new faces every time. From Afgan to Iran, Cambodia to Pakistan, Brazil to Mexico..more and more. Whether it's a simple body guarding mission for foreign minister or a real serious rescue mission in a rebel area, I enjoy every bit because the Unit team always pull out surprising moves and strats. Occasionally, unseen military toys and gadgets are revealed. Audience can get a better sense on how they pull off some of the close-to-real missions. I've totally no military background and I enjoy it quite a lot. Those with military background all said it's as close as it can be.Season 2 is slightly fine tuned compared to season 1. The entire season 1 was a pilot for me. Season 2 starts to get into a bit more story in the army base (family side). The missions are as cool as season 1's.
