Mini skirts, maxi skirts, jeans, denim jackets, floppy hats and make your own wardrobe from the Salvation Army remnants. Do your own things, chill out, make up your own identity (or identities). Try scream therapy, water therapy, thermal therapy, transcendental mediation, floatation mediation. You name it somebody tried it. Okay, enough of the memories. Of course from some of the previous writings of this reviewer in this space the descriptions above could only describe the 1960's, the time of his youth- the time of the ""Generation of `68"". And the artist under review, my contemporary, the singing/songwriter Donavan was in the thick of it. In those days he threw his hat in the ring as one of the talented musicians who was trying to find a ""different way"", musically and spiritually, from that of our parent' generation. In those days he traveled in some fast musical company, including the Beatles, Bob Dylan and Joni Mitchell.But that was then and now the 60-something is playing the old favorites, in the documentary under review, in Los Angeles in a benefit concert for movie director David Lynch's meditation center. That purpose is somewhat symbolic because the performance here, while adequate, gave me the impression that he was meditating in public. Although the audience, when scanned, seemed to like his performance there was something missing that could not be salvaged even with cameo appearances by his daughter and the Beach Boys Mike Love (on the encore ""Mellow Yellow""). I saw Donovan live in Boston, as he started to tour again, a couple of years or so before this filming and he was on fire then. So, maybe it is the hardships of touring that has taken its toll. Let's put it this way, this performance rates three stars. I am also reviewing a CD compilation of Donavan's early work, something of a greatest hits production, entitled ""Sunshine Superman"". That collection rates five stars. Something about the vagaries and ravages of aging is definitely at play here. Oh, well. If you have only one choice get the CD.That said, those who choose the film will get a full cycle of Donovan's early work, including ""Colors"" and ""Catch The Wind"" (recently used in an automobile commercial- not good) that first brought Donovan's work to my attention. ""Jennifer Juniper"", ""Mellow Yellow"" (as an encore), ""The Universal Soldier"" and ""Sunshine Superman"" are also included. Just listing his songs here evokes a whole youth of color, change, causes and clashes. Ah, those were the days.",3,Donovan Live In L.A.?,1239926400,"04 17, 2009",2009,2640,"['Hope', 'dope', 'running', 'down', 'slippery', 'slope', 'Reds', 'pinks', 'lavenders', 'colors', 'progressive', 'political', 'social', 'rainbow', 'Mini', 'skirts', 'maxi', 'skirts', 'jeans', 'denim', 'jackets', 'floppy', 'hats', 'make', 'own', 'wardrobe', 'Salvation', 'Army', 'remnants', 'Do', 'own', 'things', 'chill', 'out', 'make', 'up', 'own', 'identity', 'identities', 'Try', 'scream', 'therapy', 'water', 'therapy', 'thermal', 'therapy', 'transcendental', 'mediation', 'floatation', 'mediation', 'name', 'somebody', 'tried', 'Okay', 'enough', 'memories', 'course', 'previous', 'writings', 'reviewer', 'space', 'descriptions', 'could', 'only', 'describe', '1960', 'time', 'youth-', 'time', 'Generation', '68', 'artist', 'review', 'contemporary', 'singing/songwriter', 'Donavan', 'was', 'thick', 'days', 'threw', 'hat', 'ring', 'one', 'talented', 'musicians', 'who', 'was', 'trying', 'find', 'different', 'way', 'musically', 'spiritually', 'parent', 'generation', 'days', 'traveled', 'fast', 'musical', 'company', 'including', 'Beatles', 'Bob', 'Dylan', 'Joni', 'Mitchell.But', 'was', 'then', 'now', '60-something', 'playing', 'old', 'favorites', 'documentary', 'review', 'Los', 'Angeles', 'benefit', 'concert', 'movie', 'director', 'David', 'Lynch', 'meditation', 'center', 'purpose', 'somewhat', 'symbolic', 'performance', 'here', 'adequate', 'gave', 'impression', 'was', 'meditating', 'public', 'audience', 'when', 'scanned', 'seemed', 'like', 'performance', 'was', 'something', 'missing', 'could', 'not', 'be', 'salvaged', 'even', 'cameo', 'appearances', 'daughter', 'Beach', 'Boys', 'Mike', 'Love', 'encore', 'Mellow', 'Yellow', 'saw', 'Donovan', 'live', 'Boston', 'started', 'tour', 'again', 'couple', 'years', 'so', 'filming', 'was', 'fire', 'then', 'So', 'maybe', 'hardships', 'touring', 'taken', 'toll', 'Let', 'put', 'way', 'performance', 'rates', 'three', 'stars', 'am', 'also', 'reviewing', 'CD', 'compilation', 'Donavan', 'early', 'work', 'something', 'greatest', 'hits', 'production', 'entitled', 'Sunshine', 'Superman', 'collection', 'rates', 'five', 'stars', 'Something', 'vagaries', 'ravages', 'aging', 'definitely', 'play', 'here', 'Oh', 'well', 'have', 'only', 'one', 'choice', 'get', 'CD.That', 'said', 'who', 'choose', 'film', 'will', 'get', 'full', 'cycle', 'Donovan', 'early', 'work', 'including', 'Colors', 'Catch', 'Wind', 'recently', 'used', 'automobile', 'commercial-', 'not', 'good', 'first', 'brought', 'Donovan', 'work', 'attention', 'Jennifer', 'Juniper', 'Mellow', 'Yellow', 'encore', 'Universal', 'Soldier', 'Sunshine', 'Superman', 'are', 'also', 'included', 'Just', 'listing', 'songs', 'here', 'whole', 'youth', 'color', 'change', 'causes', 'clashes', 'Ah', 'were', 'days']",Donovan: Live in L.A. at the Kodak Theatre

It starts with a brief overview of his career (including ""Wear Your Love Like Heaven"" and ""Atlantis"" both which are not included in the show) But Donovan does all his greatest hits, tells stories of his travels with Gypsy Dave and going to India with the Beatles.Among the highlights are a sing along with the audience on ""Happiness Runs"" and a song by his daughter Astrella Celeste. Mike Love the Beach Boy who came to India with him in '68 joins Donovan and Astrella for an encore of ""Mellow Yellow"" (""What's my name again?""...)",5,David Lynch and Donovan ARE Hurdy Gurdy Men,1269216000,"03 22, 2010",2010,671,"['Recorded', 'benefit', 'concert', 'David', 'Lynch', 'Foundation', 'be', 'first', 'full-length', 'Donovan', 'concert', 'be', 'filmed', 'officially', 'brief', 'overview', 'career', 'including', 'Love', 'Heaven', 'Atlantis', 'are', 'not', 'included', 'show', 'Donovan', 'greatest', 'hits', 'tells', 'stories', 'travels', 'Gypsy', 'Dave', 'going', 'India', 'Beatles.Among', 'highlights', 'are', 'sing', 'audience', 'Happiness', 'Runs', 'song', 'daughter', 'Astrella', 'Celeste', 'Mike', 'Love', 'Beach', 'Boy', 'who', 'came', 'India', ""'68"", 'joins', 'Donovan', 'Astrella', 'encore', 'Mellow', 'Yellow', 'What', 'name', 'again']",Donovan: Live in L.A. at the Kodak Theatre

For me, the answer is a definite yes. Donovan's music is a pleasant memory of growing up for me, and I have always liked his simple style and of course his poetry - minimal fuss with a powerful message. This concert captures the essence of Donovan surprisingly well in my opinion, given the relatively simple stage setting and choreography. Just him, a bass player and a percussionist, creating excellent sounds throughout the evening. His voice sounds like it is still 1964, and his guitar playing throughout is a real highlight for me. The video and sound are both top quality.The set list contains mostly well-known hits, with a few lesser-known songs in the mix. I was somewhat underwhelmed by the appearances of his daughter and, in one instance, former Beach Boy Mike Love - nothing spectacular there. But for the most part, just the man, his guitar and backup musicians kept me and the audience in the Kodak theater spellbound, for sure.  Personal favorites are Try for the Sun, Young Girl Blues and Lalena - wow, can this guy play guitar and sing!All in all, a great concert that I'll be sure to enjoy over and over.",5,Worth the wait,1201824000,"02 1, 2008",2008,1350,"['had', 'heard', 'Donovan', 'LA', 'concert', 'PBS', 'missed', 'broadcast', 'time', 'was', 'therefore', 'anxiously', 'awaiting', 'package', 'Amazon', 'when', 'DVD', 'finally', 'was', 'released', 'January', 'year.Was', 'wait', 'answer', 'definite', 'yes', 'Donovan', 'music', 'pleasant', 'memory', 'growing', 'up', 'have', 'always', 'liked', 'simple', 'style', 'course', 'poetry', 'minimal', 'fuss', 'powerful', 'message', 'concert', 'essence', 'Donovan', 'surprisingly', 'well', 'opinion', 'given', 'relatively', 'simple', 'stage', 'setting', 'choreography', 'Just', 'bass', 'player', 'percussionist', 'creating', 'excellent', 'sounds', 'evening', 'voice', 'sounds', 'still', '1964', 'guitar', 'playing', 'real', 'highlight', 'video', 'sound', 'are', 'top', 'quality.The', 'set', 'list', 'contains', 'mostly', 'well-known', 'hits', 'few', 'lesser-known', 'songs', 'mix', 'was', 'somewhat', 'underwhelmed', 'appearances', 'daughter', 'one', 'instance', 'former', 'Beach', 'Boy', 'Mike', 'Love', 'nothing', 'spectacular', 'there', 'most', 'part', 'just', 'man', 'guitar', 'backup', 'musicians', 'kept', 'audience', 'Kodak', 'theater', 'spellbound', 'sure', 'Personal', 'favorites', 'are', 'Try', 'Sun', 'Young', 'Girl', 'Blues', 'Lalena', 'wow', 'can', 'guy', 'play', 'guitar', 'sing', 'great', 'concert', ""'ll"", 'be', 'sure', 'enjoy']",Donovan: Live in L.A. at the Kodak Theatre
