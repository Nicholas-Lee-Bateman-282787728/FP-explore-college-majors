I was even more happy when I first heard all the episodes were coming out on dvd. I thought these episodes would never come out on DVD, I was also glad that the shipping didn't take too long. I'm looking forward to the final season coming next month. I think everyone who hasn't seen this cartoon should definetly check it out.",5,"If you like cartoons, you should watch this one.",1373500800,"07 11, 2013",2013,451,"[""'ve"", 'watched', 'cartoon', 'was', 'jr.', 'high', 'became', 'one', 'favorite', 'cartoon', 'shows', 'watching', 'afew', 'episodes', 'was', 'even', 'more', 'happy', 'when', 'first', 'heard', 'episodes', 'were', 'coming', 'out', 'dvd', 'thought', 'episodes', 'would', 'never', 'come', 'out', 'DVD', 'was', 'also', 'glad', 'shipping', 'did', ""n't"", 'take', 'too', 'long', ""'m"", 'looking', 'forward', 'final', 'season', 'coming', 'next', 'month', 'think', 'everyone', 'who', ""n't"", 'seen', 'cartoon', 'should', 'definetly', 'check', 'out']","CatDog: Season 2, Part 2"

For me in watching these last episodes of the series, I found myself laughing as well as a bit nostalgic on the rest of the episodes that were made and a bit amazed at the number of episodes that were created for only two seasons. This was a series that will definitely keep you engaged and by the end you will want to come back and watch the episodes again (or at least I did). Shout Factory did a great job at pulling the episodes together and providing a high quality production! If you are already a fan you will want this to complete your collection. If you have never seen this series, this is a great collection of cartoons that are funny, and witty and ones that I would highly recommend!",5,A Great end to the series!,1346198400,"08 29, 2012",2012,889,"['have', 'loved', 'past', 'DVD', 'Shout', 'Factory', 'have', 'released', 'one', 'not', 'different', 'get', '10', 'great', 'episodes', 'funny', 'cartoon', 'series', 'ended', 'too', 'quickly', 'opinion', 'watching', 'last', 'episodes', 'series', 'found', 'laughing', 'as', 'well', 'bit', 'nostalgic', 'rest', 'episodes', 'were', 'made', 'bit', 'amazed', 'number', 'episodes', 'were', 'created', 'only', 'two', 'seasons', 'was', 'series', 'will', 'definitely', 'keep', 'engaged', 'end', 'will', 'want', 'come', 'back', 'watch', 'episodes', 'again', 'least', 'did', 'Shout', 'Factory', 'did', 'great', 'job', 'pulling', 'episodes', 'together', 'providing', 'high', 'quality', 'production', 'are', 'already', 'fan', 'will', 'want', 'complete', 'collection', 'have', 'never', 'seen', 'series', 'great', 'collection', 'cartoons', 'are', 'funny', 'witty', 'ones', 'would', 'highly', 'recommend']","CatDog: Season 2, Part 2"
