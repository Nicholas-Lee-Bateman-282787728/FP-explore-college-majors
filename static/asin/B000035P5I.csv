I fell in love with this movie back in 1995, after I missed seeing it at the movies.  Payne {Jason} and {Pinkett} Lyric portray lovers torn between Payne's undying love and devotion to his brother.  The passion between them is undeniable and their love scenes are incredibly HOT!!  Payne's ne're-do-well brother, Joshua {Woodbine} plays the hard-headed prison thug who struggles to stay on the right path.  Payne is also plagued by nighmares he suffers as a result of a struggle between his parents that ended up in tragedy.  In effort to get away from all the drama and the nonsense, he and Lyric plan to just go far away and leave everyone -and everything- behind.  Everytime I watch this movie, I cry.

515962,A3RA9ZE9ARIUWD,B000035P5I,Julius,"[0, 2]","This was a movie I've been wanting to see since I was 11 years, so by the time I finally got a chance to see it, I was highly anticipating it. I liked it the first 4 times I saw it, but after the 5th time, I didn't like it as much. What changed? Well for one Allen Payne, who was convincingly in New Jack City, had an inconsistent performance as Jason. Sometimes he looked like an Oscar winning actor, other times he looked really amateur. His delivery of his lines at times was horrible and seemed really forced. Bokeem Woodbine as Joshua, had a much better performance than Payne. Woodbine's portrayal of Joshua is charismatic, intimidating, and compassionate. There were times you hated Joshua and other times, you ended up rooting for him. Woodbine's performance was one of the best in the film. Another excellent performance is Treach as Alonzo, the leader of a bank robbing crew. Alonzo is charismatic, menacing, volatile, and compassionate. Treach does an excellent job displaying all those emotions. At times, Alonzo is hatable, but by the end of the movie, you actually feel sorry for him. As great as Woodbine and Treach were, this movie goes downhill thanks to Jada Pinkett Smith. She didn't seem convincing as a romantic lead and an object of affection. Her delivery of her lines was off as well at times. I'm not saying I hate this movie. However it could have been better. I'm probably in the minority for what I think about this movie, but that's ok. For those of you who have never seen this movie, you might like it to the point where it will leave a lasting impression in your mind forever.

In the midst of so much blight this film shows you that you don't need to have a Monster's Ball to know that love is courage and that there is hope in the bleakest of situations.Allen Payne and Jada Pinkett give the best performances of their careers in this story of a man coming to terms with his troubled past while trying to help his brother (Bookeem Woodbine) who has just got out of prison. One day at work he finds his true love Lyric (Jada Pinkett) who wants to help him achieve his dream of a better life. He gets several chances, but is forced to turn them down because of his obligation to his brother. In a climatic conflict with his brother, Jason stops being his brother's keeper and resolves his personal issues. Jason achieves his dream and moves on with Lyric.The script is well written; characters are well defined and have more dimensions than shown on the surface. The choices they make in their to change lives feel natural and not forced. Allen Payne makes you feel Jason's pain while Jada Pinkett shows us Lyric's love and compassion. Both Payne and Pinkett deserve better than what Hollywood has offered them currently, when given quality material they shine. Bokeem Woodbine makes you feel sorry for Jason's brother; you hate what he does, not him. Other noteworthy performances include Suzanne Douglas and Forrest Whitaker as Jason's Parents, and the two child actors who play young Jason and his brother. The production values are top notch on this film; I don't know why critics roasted this movie. It is very well done and should have been nominated for some Oscars.This film has quite a few steamy love scenes; this film is not for kids.
