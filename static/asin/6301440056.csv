What I like about the movie is that James Belushi stars as Thomas Dooley, an unorthodox narcotics cop who teams with an independently minded police dog in this hilarious action-comedy. Headstrong Dooley is one step away from nailing a prominent socialite in a $50 million cocaine bust. He's branded as too crazy to partner with, and no one will work with him except Jerry Lee, a superbly trained German shepherd police dog with the best nose in the drug-busting business. The unconventional pairing pleases neither partner, but after a series of shootouts, stakeouts, brawls and romantic misadventures, they develop a grudging respect for each other. It's a heartwarming, fast-footed adventure about an unlikely and unbeatable police team that will have you rooting for man's best friend.

I saw the original movie about a decade ago and fell in love with it. The main reason is my GSD (German Shepherd Dog) King who passed away 3 years ago was exactly like Jerry Lee. From the moaning to almost everything in the movie. I got King from a breeder and while he was not a LE K9 he was trained in detection and protection. When he wasn't training with me he was so much like Jerry Lee I had to have this movie. Kings life achievement was assisting Law Enforcement after Hurricane Katrina in delaying and capturing looters right after the storm. Jerry Lee is everything in this movie that GSD's are in real life. They are dedicated to their masters to death. Out of the three movies the first is the best hands down, my attraction to the other movies in the series just happened to the the GSD's and not Mr. Belushi. Dont get me wrong Mr. Belushi is funny in the movie when his character receives Jerry Lee and starts to learn about the breed and working with them. I would suggest anyone who has a love for dogs, especially K9's and the GSD's purchase the movie. The interaction between actor and canine is wonderful and well worth the price of the movie. A small foot note, the original Jerry Lee was a real Police K9 who after the first movie really gave his life in the line of duty during a drug bust gone wrong.

The task is by no means an easy one, as he meets the nursing staff's firm refusal at every turn, culminating in a confrontation with an exasperated ER doc who assures him:""Don't get so excited, It's just a DOG!"" to which Belushi(as Officer Dooley) declares(with STUNNING conviction):""""He's NOT just a DOG!  He's a COP!  And he's not just ANY cop, he's my PARTNER!  He's bleeding to death!  Either you help him NOW or he's gonna DIE!""  After the dazed medical staff wheel off Jerry Lee into surgery, you simply MUST LISTEN to Dooley's truly HEARTRENDING, straight from the gut reverie, spoken to HIMSELF more than his girlfriend Tracy(Mel Harris).It simply breaks my heart EVERY time I hear it, as it's almost the exact same thing I heard an officer say in an animal ER many years ago! I challenge ANYONE to listen to him and NOT be moved right to the core.  I swear that one scene-even if there was nothing else to recommend the film for-makes this film SO compelling to watch.  A brilliant, sincere and surprising highmark of the film,I think it's easily James Belushi's finest screen moment.This film unfortunately gets too many comparisons with ""Turner & Hooch""(similar plots and both released the same year).  What sets this film APART is that ""K-9"" asserts-albeit in a lighthearted manner befitting a screwball comedy-what MANY officers over the years have admitted:that your police dog does indeed become MORE than a mere tool to enhance your job performance.  He becomes your PARTNER,deserving your utmost respect and support in ALL situations.""Jerry Lee"" is utterly adorable and amazing to watch as Belushi's shaggy canine partner.
