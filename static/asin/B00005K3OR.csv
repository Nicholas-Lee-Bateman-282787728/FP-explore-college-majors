660642,A2QHM5HBSIXRL4,B00005K3OR,Andy Orrock,"[43, 44]","I recently saw Richard Curtis' wonderful 'Love Actually' and - having been bowled over once again by the bountiful comic talents of Bill Nighy and great work of the sloe-eyed, laconic Alan Rickman - wondered where to turn next to enjoy the work of these two fine actors.The answer: &quot;Blow Dry.&quot;  Rickman and Nighy are fabulous as long-time rival hairdresser competitors in this campy but touching tale that tries very hard to get that unique &quot;Strictly Ballroom&quot; feel and camp/pathos/triumph balance.  It falls just short of that, but it's a real treat nevertheless.Unfortunately, judging from the irksome U.S. coverbox you'd never guess this was such a touching, well-written and intelligently humorous movie with a *very* talented cast - Nighy, Rickman, Natasha Richardson (!), Rachel Griffiths (!!).  Now, that's an honor roll.  With all that going for it, why, why, why do we get force-fed a marketing campaign featuring Josh Harnett and Rachael Leigh Cook?  Harnett is quite good here, actually, pulling off a British accent with aplomb.  But poor Cook is placed into a no-win situation as the supposed Minneapolis-based daughter of hairdresser Nighy.  It seems force-fed into the movie...she's totally boxed in here and can't fight her way out.I ignored this movie for two years because of bad marketing. How many others are going to miss out for the same reason?  I knew Nighy (possibly my favorite actor) was involved, but felt like I was going to have to sit through a Harnett/Cook &quot;She's All That&quot; clone.  I had to have a friend tell me otherwise.  Turns out, nothing could be further from the truth.  This is a great little film you need to check out as soon as possible.Two additional little treats -- Warren Clarke as The Mayor, who gets more and more showy and confident as the movie goes on (and actually shepards the film through its credits in a bit of solo showmanship).  Name ring a bell?  How about 'Dim' in &quot;A Clockwork Orange&quot;?  Wow!  Also, he's known in the UK most recently as Detective Andy Dalziel in the recurring TV series &quot;Dalziel and Pascoe.&quot;- Heidi Klum, hiding behind pancake makeup and blonde fright wig as 'Total Look' muse 'Jasmine.'

660651,A2NX99GVAX4TRP,B00005K3OR,"Christopher J. Jarmick ""Word  Lover""","[5, 7]","If your expecting an outrageously campy comedy ala' Priscilla, Queen of the Desert or a film like Strictly Ballroom. . . you'll be very disappointed by this one. Although it's written by the writer of The Full Monty, it's a film that misses more opportunities to be funny than it hits. The fact that a lot of that is intentional is not necessarily a good thing at all. It's also the third film of the late 2000/2001 season that's about hair dressers or wigs ( An Everlasting Piece, The Big Tease ).As the film introduces us to its characters we quickly learn than one of them is dying from cancer. This immediately tells us the film is probably not going to be one full of outrageous and John Waters' like camp comedy (Hairspray, Polyester, Pink Flamingos), but rather be more of a bittersweet, heart-warming romantic comedy of a film that has a pretty interesting gimmick --the hair dressing competition. It doesn't seem to be quite sure what it wants to be as it gives us a main character dying of a disease, a Romeo and Juliet type romance, and a low key Rocky kind of film all delivered with a package that should have been over-the-top campy but isn't.The most famous and respected hairstylists from around the world descend upon the tiny Yorkshire village for the annual hairdressing Championships. We meet former resident Bill(Nighy), a cheating egotist who has brought his estranged daughter Christina (Cook) with him to possibly use as his colorist. Bill also learns his ex chief rival Phil (Rickman) is in town and he can hardly wait to gloat over how much more successful and famous he's become. Phil is divorced and has traded in his gold show scissors to run his modest local barber shop with his son, Brian (Hartnett) while not speaking to his ex-wife Shelley (Richardson) who's in a lesbian relationship with his former hair model Rachel (Griffiths). Shelley and Rachel run a full service salon across town. If this isn't sounding too funny to you.. you're right. It isn't. It isn't supposed to be either. But while these aren't the typical characters we've seen in domestic dramas, we've seen the circumstances for this type of drama too many times to be moved or all that interested in any of it.Good thing we're watching charismatic performances. It is also no big surprise that these characters will eventually be involved with each other again and be competing in the hair dressing contest--exactly as you expect. It's probably not a good sign when what should be a quirky out of the ordinary comedy begins with too heavy a helping of pathos and then becomes and remains extremely predictable from start to finish. Most viewers will be way ahead of the film, and there's not real surprises being offered except perhaps that is not nearly as outrageous or campy as you might be expecting it to be. I won't tell you too much more than that about the film because there aren't all that many surprises or laughs in the film and if you are going to enjoy it all you don't need me ruining some of the film's modest surprises.There are several recognizable faced in the film's cast and they are all quite good in their roles. Alan Rickman however is almost too low key for the majority of the film and that's another missed opportunity because he would have been more fun if his role had been written to allow him to play his part a bit more broadly.Let's review: Blow Dry is all wet. It combs over comedic opportunities in favor of immersing itself in a run through of tangled subplots which dulls much of the potential luster and glow the film's gimmick and performances might have had. In short, it's a pleasant but very modest film that offers absolutely nothing to get the least bit excited about except as an opportunity to see an impressive cast.The DVD looks pretty good over all visually and audio wise the main complaint is that some of the fun music cues are mixed too low. The only notable extra is a brief 7 minute behind the scene featurette which is both promotional and informative. It covers the bases in the expected manner and includes brief comments from one of the producers Sydney Pollack.If you watch Blow Dry without expectations and don't want to think too much, it's an enjoyable film with some decent performances, several overly familiar story lines and a nice gimmick (the hair dressing competition). The film's tone is bittersweet as well as comedic and it misses several opportunities for humor making it a light, warmhearted forgettable little truffle of a film. The DVD is pretty bare bones but for those interested in the cast it might be worth a rental.Christopher J. Jarmick is the co-author (WITH Serena F.

The direction is stiff and some things seem to happen at the wrong time. Other things don't make sense. And Hartnett wrestling with the Brit accent is something all by itself. Couldn't they find a real Limey to fill the role? This is just a real mess. The soundtrack, though, is really good. They flipped for some nifty tunes.They actors all do a decent job with what they were given. They just weren't given much. It almost seems as though they took the idea from &#34;Best in Show&#34; and played it as straight narrative instead of mockumentary.

I have seen this little concoction four times now and it like hair grows on you. A little town in England is chosen for the British Hair Dressing Championship where the candidates must compete in four categories: Women's Blow Dry Combs, Men's Free Style, Hair By Night and Total Look. The plot isn't complicated and is predictable: you know Phil, who hasn't competed in ten years, will come out of retirement and comb and blow-dry hair with sweet abandon. But there are funny stops along the way. Try dying the hair of the dead, for example. Or giving a senior citizen a do that would have looked great in an Eighteenth Century drawing room or that the late Republican Martha Mitchell would have worn. Throw in a romance or two and a couple of cheaters in the competition and you get enough laughs for everyone. The critics-- at least some of them-- are concerned that the movie can't decide if it's high camp (maybe high hair) or a too serious commentary on life. I see their point but didn't flip my wig because of that. On a serious note, the movie makes a statement about what makes up a family, something the Republicans say they are concerned about.

He was a former hotshot hairdresser competing for the top prize, but now he runs a two-chair barbershop in the same little town as....* Natasha Richardson (""Evening""), his former wife. She too, was a finalist ""back in the day."" Now she runs a beauty shop with her lover....* Rachel Griffiths (""Six Feet Under"") who had been our hero's hair model until she ran off with his wife during the hairdressing finals a few years back.* Josh Hartnett (""Singularity"") is the son who stayed with his dad. He does some barbering but his main job is to style the hair of the corpses at the local mortuary.* Bill Nighy (""The Best Exotic Marigold Hotel"") is our hero's arch rival. He swans into town with his name practically engraved on the top prize. He is insulting, demeaning and overly confident.* Rachael Leigh Cook (""The Family Tree"") is the daughter of that haughty rival, but she remembers a handsome boy from those competitions a few years ago. He looks mighty appealing....* Warren Clarke (""Pale Rider"") is the mayor of little Keighley. Watch him evolve as the days pass.

The family, comprised of Alan Rickman and his grown son, played by Joshua Harnett, run the town barber shop and are estranged from their former wife and mother, played by Natasha Richardson. The estrangement came about ten years previously, when she ran off with their hairdressing model, played by Rachel Griffiths, a woman with whom she still maintains a loving, romantic relationship and openly lives with as a couple. Rickman, feeling that he had not only been betrayed but made a laughingstock, has not forgiven her.Unbeknownst to them all, Natasha is going to die, as she has lost the war with the cancer that she has been battling. When she discovers that the big hairdressing competition is coming to their town, she hopes for a last bit of glory and familial reconciliation. You see, when she ran off with Rachel Griffiths ten years prior, she did so on the eve of the hairdressing competition that they were all favored to win. Obviously, her actions squelched that prospect at the time. She hopes to make things right, now that the end is near.She finally persuades them with much difficulty to enter the competition, where Rickman encounters his old nemesis. Then, the bag of tricks begin to fly, all of which were done much better in the movie &quot;The Big Tease&quot;. The movie has a little difficulty deciding whether to play it for laughs or for pathos. Ultimately, pathos wins, but not without the movie having suffered from some indecision on this front. Still, Rickman, Richardson, and Griffiths are wonderful, as always, and the movie does have its worthwhile moments.

660667,A1IWWRZJOXOSYP,B00005K3OR,Lee Armstrong,"[3, 4]","Director Paddy Breathnach does a good job making ""Blow Dry"" look good.  After an initial Irish production called ""Asila"" in 1994 & an Irish road picture in 1997 called ""I Went Down,"" he gets an excellent veteran cast.  Josh Hartnett plays Brian and is featured prominently on the DVD cover.  With his film roots in ""The Faculty,"" ""Town & Country"" with Warren Beatty & Diane Keaton, Sophia Coppola's ""The Virgin Suicides,"" he's increasingly played in big pictures like ""Pearl Harbor,"" ""Hollywood Homocide,"" ""Wicker Park"" & ""Sin City.""  In this film, he plays the son of legendary hairdressers and gets involved in the national hairdressing competition.  His accent sounds like he studied it a few weeks before shooting; and Paddy might have opted to having had him return from years in America and then speak with his own Minnesota accent.  But he falls in love with Christina played by Rachel Leigh Cook, also from Minnesota; so they are a bit of a matched pair as far as trying accents that are just a bit beyond them.  Cook was memorable as the young Holly Hunter in ""Living Out Loud"" and in ""29 Palms"" & ""Stateside.""  Natasha Richardson plays the mother Shelley who became a lesbian right before the national championships a decade ago and now suffers from a terminal cancer & wants her family to heal a bit before she dies.  Richardson is the daughter of Vanessa Redgrave and played the socialite in ""Maid In Manhattan"" whose coat Jennifer Lopez steals.  She also produced & acted in ""Asylum.""  She does seem anxious about her bad chemo hair and reaches levels of grief, but her energy remains high as she tries to enlist the aid of her ex-husband.  Alan Rickman plays said ex Phil with a haughty disdain for the woman who injured his pride.  There doesn't seem to be much love between the father & son, which made the dynamics of the picture a bit hard to buy.  Rickman won the British Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor for ""Robin Hood: Prince of Thieves"" and went on to play the bad guy for Bruce Willis in ""Die Hard"" and as Snape in the Harry Potter movies (Sorcerer's Stone, Chamber of Secrets, Prisoner of Azkaban).  He excels at being unlikable and does not seem to mesh here in this ensemble.  Shelley's love interest is Sandra played by Rachel Griffiths.  Her contest entry has some of the most breathtaking makeup you're likely to see!  Australian Griffiths broke through on screen in 1994 in ""Muriel's Wedding,"" got a Best Supporting Actress nomination for ""Hilary & Jackie,"" a Golden Globe for the TV series ""Six Feet Under"" and appeared with Heath Ledger in ""Ned Kelly.""  She does a convincing job as the caring but self-absorbed lesbian lover.  The main hairdressing nemesis Ray is played by Bill Nighy.  With a natural deadpan delivery style, it contrasts with the flamboyant unethical hairdresser who will do anything to win the title.  Nighy played the fading rocker hilariously in ""Love Actually"" and has appeared in ""The Full Monty,"" ""Underworld,"" ""Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy"" & ""The Constant Gardener.""  I thought he did a great job and was a delight to watch.  Simon Beaufoy who got an Oscar nomination for Best Original Screenplay for ""The Full Monty"" in 1997 does a fairly good job at making this absurdly wacky situation interesting.  All in all, this film somehow fails to gel completely, but it is worth seeing if only for the hairstyles and makeup.

Just as bad were the actors playing the minor roles.3) Josh Hartnett's attempt at a British accent was sad.4) Alan Rickman, Natasha Richardson, Bill Nighy and Josh Hartnett were given terrible lines.  What a waste of an AMAZING cast!It seems as though the actors/directors/producers went to England on vacation separately, while there they met up with each other at the hotel lounge over drinks, and then decided, on the spot, to make the best of their stay by doing a quick and easy film on the side for some extra cash/spending money.Though the potential for a good movie was definitely there it fails to take off, primarily due to the writers.In a nutshell, it's an ok movie and that's about it; no masterpiece here...

I read several reviews about it and thought I would find out for myself how good it was.I am very glad that I rented (and very soon after, bought it) the movie.  The performances by everyone were very well done.Alan Rickman shines, as usual, as the divorced Phil Allen--a hair dresser who was once widely known for his incredible talent, but is now much more isolated.  His performance is just incredible.  I cannot find another word to describe him in this movie.Natasha Richardson is not only gorgeous but also a wonderful actress.  She gives a heartwarming performance in this movie.  All her character--Shelley wants to do is reunite her family because of something that is going on with her (I don't want to give it away).  When I first heard that she plays a lesbian in the movie I found it hard to believe that she could pull it off, but she was great!  Her performance brought tears to my eyes.Rachel Griffiths gives a stellar performance as Sandra, Shelley's partner.  Oh my goodness, she brought tears to my eyes as well!  She is a wonderful actress and I am so glad that she was cast in this movie.As for Rachel Leigh Cook and Josh Hartnett, they were pretty good.  Josh's accent wasn't the best, but it wasn't the worst either.  I have no idea why the two of them are on the cover of the tape/DVD.  They are NOT the main characters!!!Other than that, the other characters (especially Bill Nighy) were fantastic.  The whole movie is wonderful.

BLOW DRY is one of those undiscovered gems that surprised and impressed me. The movie's hairstylists are to be commended for their outrageously hideous, sometime enchanting, always interesting hairstyles. The cast is almost letter perfect, with some of the supporting players stealing several of their scenes. Alan Rickman as the betrayed husband of Natasha Richardson brings his usual stoic charm to his role, and Richardson is wonderful as the ex-wife who learns she has terminal cancer. Richardson left Rickman for their model played with youthful relish by the talented Rachel Griffiths. Josh Hartnett, with an acceptable British accent, shows his versatility in stepping out of his usual heartthrob roles to play Richardson and Rickman's son, who has followed his father's barber footsteps but wants to participate in the contest too. Rachael Lee Cook as Christina is given a poorly developed role, but she plays it with such innocence and grace she comes off well. Bill Nighy (who was so wonderful as the hasbeen rock star in &quot;Love Actually&quot;) is delightful in his role as Rickman's egotistical rival, and brings his spit and venom into the role. Warren Clarke as the mayor is remarkable as we watch him change from skeptical bystander to a truly involved host. The movie also uses some great songs that actually match the scene going on, i.e. &quot;Couldn't Get It Right&quot; by the Climax Blues Band; &quot;Don't Let Me Be Misunderstood&quot; by Santa Esmeralda, and &quot;Lovely Day&quot; by Bill Withers.BLOW DRY is a delightfully refreshing movie; I Haven't seen &quot;The Big Tease&quot; , so I can't compare it with that movie. But for me, BLOW DRY is one of those pleasant surprises that come along and give me faith that people are still out there creating enjoyable movies without too much sex or violence.

Must be some nutty teen comedy, right?Well, with one cancer diagnosis and one death in the first 15 minutes, Blow Dry is hardly the feel-good romance you'd expect. Strikingly similar to The Big Tease, Blow Dry tells the story of a haircutting competition that descends on a small town in Britain. Celebrities (well, celebrity stylists) from around England arrive to compete, and the local boys get into the act as well. But while the drama unfolds with models and shears, another drama takes place among the locals -- largely involving various romances and a singular cancer victim.Filled with some good actors -- Alan Rickman, Natasha Richardson, Rachel Griffiths -- and some okay ones -- Hartnett and Cook -- I was expecting a lot more from Blow Dry. Alas, the material just isn't up to par, leaving the real Brits flailing for inspiration and the American posers sporting some of the worst phony British accents ever: Cook doesn't even try in most of her scenes. [Note: A faithful reader writes to tell me that Cook's character isn't supposed to be British, she's American. He also suggests I watch the film again to see for myself... a prospect which sounds to awful to bear.]The hairstyles are alternately lovely and laughable, as is the sentiment in the film as a whole.

With the right atmosphere, characters and background music directors can successfully make an audience care about anything they want. If someone wanted to make a drama about a hamster, and they did it well enough, they could probably make a handful of people cry over the tests and toils of their poor little hamster.However, Paddy Breathnach's `Blow Dry' is a good example of what not to do when attempting to make an audience care about something that they normally wouldn't. The whole movie is about hair. The idea is to make people watching care which obsessive-compulsive barber wins an English hairdressing tournament. The whole thing it just weird.`Blow Dry' (2000) stars Natasha Richardson as Shelley, a middle-aged hairdresser with a lesbian lover, a lot of really tight clothes, and incurable cancer. She hasn't spoken to her ex-husband Phil Allen (Alan Rickman) for ten years, her son, Brian (Josh Hartnett), is embarrassed to be seen with her, and to make matters worse they all live in the same, tiny village in England.Ultimately, `Blow Dry' is about the regrouping of an exceptionally dysfunctional family. The whole competition aspect works as a catalyst that forces them to face both the past and the future.The acting is basically decent. Richardson, Rickman, and Rachel Griffiths are all well suited for their roles and for Hartnett, this movie was the first step away from `heart throb' towards serious actor, but his efforts are overshadowed by the presence of Rachel Leigh Cook. Cook plays the American daughter of the Allen's biggest rival. Her character, Christina, crams into the plot with a horrifying lack of grace that makes it seem like someone went back and added her into all the scenes after the rest of the script was finished.  The only possible excuse for Cook's blunder of an acting job is the randomness of her role.`Blow Dry' wasn't quite there as far as I'm concerned. The storyline steps into a strange territory that leaves the audience wondering if they just watched a comedy or a drama, and feeling particularly unsatisfied with the outcome. I liked parts of it, but as a whole it did nothing for me.",2,Josh Hartnett's Accent Was the Best Part...,1059696000,"08 1, 2003",2003,2200,"['Movies', 'have', 'way', 'making', 'care', 'what', ""'re"", 'right', 'atmosphere', 'characters', 'background', 'music', 'directors', 'can', 'successfully', 'make', 'audience', 'care', 'anything', 'want', 'someone', 'wanted', 'make', 'drama', 'hamster', 'did', 'well', 'enough', 'could', 'probably', 'make', 'handful', 'people', 'cry', 'tests', 'toils', 'poor', 'little', 'hamster.However', 'Paddy', 'Breathnach', 'Blow', 'Dry', 'good', 'example', 'what', 'not', 'do', 'when', 'attempting', 'make', 'audience', 'care', 'something', 'normally', 'would', ""n't"", 'whole', 'movie', 'hair', 'idea', 'make', 'people', 'watching', 'care', 'obsessive-compulsive', 'barber', 'English', 'hairdressing', 'tournament', 'whole', 'thing', 'just', 'weird.', 'Blow', 'Dry', '2000', 'Natasha', 'Richardson', 'Shelley', 'middle-aged', 'hairdresser', 'lesbian', 'lover', 'lot', 'really', 'tight', 'clothes', 'incurable', 'cancer', ""n't"", 'spoken', 'ex-husband', 'Phil', 'Allen', 'Alan', 'Rickman', 'ten', 'years', 'son', 'Brian', 'Josh', 'Hartnett', 'embarrassed', 'be', 'seen', 'make', 'matters', 'worse', 'live', 'same', 'tiny', 'village', 'England.Ultimately', 'Blow', 'Dry', 'regrouping', 'exceptionally', 'dysfunctional', 'family', 'whole', 'competition', 'aspect', 'catalyst', 'face', 'past', 'future.The', 'acting', 'basically', 'decent', 'Richardson', 'Rickman', 'Rachel', 'Griffiths', 'are', 'well', 'suited', 'roles', 'Hartnett', 'movie', 'was', 'first', 'step', 'away', 'heart', 'throb', 'towards', 'serious', 'actor', 'efforts', 'are', 'overshadowed', 'presence', 'Rachel', 'Leigh', 'Cook', 'Cook', 'American', 'daughter', 'Allen', 'biggest', 'rival', 'character', 'Christina', 'plot', 'horrifying', 'lack', 'grace', 'seem', 'someone', 'went', 'back', 'added', 'scenes', 'rest', 'script', 'was', 'finished', 'only', 'possible', 'excuse', 'Cook', 'blunder', 'acting', 'job', 'randomness', 'role.', 'Dry', 'was', ""n't"", 'quite', 'there', 'as', 'far', ""'m"", 'concerned', 'storyline', 'steps', 'strange', 'territory', 'audience', 'wondering', 'just', 'watched', 'comedy', 'drama', 'feeling', 'particularly', 'unsatisfied', 'outcome', 'liked', 'parts', 'whole', 'did', 'nothing']",N/A

The cover art for the DVD shows Josh Hartnett but the REAL stars are Alan Rickman, Rachel Griffiths, Bill Nighy, and Natasha Richardson.When Griffiths appears at the end completely in the nude with fantastic tattooing and hairstyle it is enough to turn a gay man straight - what a body.  She continues the very good work she did in ""Muriel's Wedding.""Another under-rated actor in the movie is Warren Clarke who demonstrated his superb acting abilities in the Dalziel and Pascoe series on British television.  He is touching and very funny as the mayor of the small town and the emcee for the ""pageant"".Rickman as usual does extraordinary things with a smallish part and Bill Nighy, another under-rated actor, is great as his rival.  The insights into high-fashion and competitive hairdressing is intriguing and some of the hairdoes are worthy of the court of Queen Marie Antoinette.ALtogether a great movie and one that I will return to when I want to see accomplished British actors perform their art with aplomb.",4,CHARMING COMEDY-MELODRAMA,1198540800,"12 25, 2007",2007,1099,"['was', 'pleasantly', 'surprised', 'movie', 'witty', 'insightful', 'touching', 'cover', 'art', 'DVD', 'Josh', 'Hartnett', 'REAL', 'stars', 'are', 'Alan', 'Rickman', 'Rachel', 'Griffiths', 'Bill', 'Nighy', 'Natasha', 'Richardson.When', 'Griffiths', 'end', 'completely', 'nude', 'fantastic', 'tattooing', 'hairstyle', 'enough', 'turn', 'gay', 'man', 'straight', 'what', 'body', 'very', 'good', 'work', 'did', 'Muriel', 'Wedding', 'under-rated', 'actor', 'movie', 'Warren', 'Clarke', 'who', 'demonstrated', 'superb', 'acting', 'abilities', 'Dalziel', 'Pascoe', 'series', 'British', 'television', 'touching', 'very', 'funny', 'mayor', 'small', 'town', 'emcee', 'pageant', '.Rickman', 'usual', 'extraordinary', 'things', 'smallish', 'part', 'Bill', 'Nighy', 'under-rated', 'actor', 'great', 'rival', 'insights', 'high-fashion', 'competitive', 'hairdressing', 'intriguing', 'hairdoes', 'are', 'worthy', 'court', 'Queen', 'Marie', 'Antoinette.ALtogether', 'great', 'movie', 'one', 'will', 'return', 'when', 'want', 'see', 'accomplished', 'British', 'actors', 'perform', 'art', 'aplomb']",N/A
