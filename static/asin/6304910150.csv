439109,ANCOMAI0I7LVG,6304910150,Andrew Ellington,"[3, 9]","Ha, so I think you should be able to draw from my review title that I can easily compare this film to `Tyler Perry's: Why Did I Get Married?' and honestly, I feel very similar about the two films.  If you've read my review for the other one (it stirred much heated debate and actually garnered me some hate mail) you'd know that I was not a huge fan.  While I admitted to liking the film I also stated that I felt it had a lot of issues (not the least of which was Janet Jackson).  I feel the same here.  In parts I like this movie, but as a whole I don't think it works quite like everyone else seems to say it does.I think most of you are delusional, but whatever.The film tells of three couples who have been friends for many years and who take vacations together every season.  The film takes place over the course of four seasons (or a year for those of you not mathematically inclined) and it shows the strain the friendships come over thanks to getting older.  Nick expresses his desire to leave his wife Anne during the first season, and that sets off a chain reaction as the couples now have to get used to his newer, younger woman.  Jack and Kate seem the most stable of the other two couples, while Claudia and Danny are apparently not as happy as they once were; both needing a spark to ignite their love for one another.Like I said; in parts this is good.When looking over this season for season I have come to terms with what works and what doesn't.  For instance; the overall plot of six friends shifting in their relationship over the course of the year works, but the way that Alda develops his characters does not.  This is a major problem because it takes away from the genuineness of the film and it makes it hard to relate to the characters.  I understand that people have flaws, so please; I don't want anymore comments about how I don't understand that no one is perfect or whatever.  There is a difference between flaws and what we have going on here (and in Perry's mess as well).  These characters are so unlikable and annoying you can't help but despise them.I would never be friends with anyone in this movie; and I find it very hard to believe that they would remain friends.The first season is probably the worst of all.  So, I guess it sufficed to say this movie gets off to a rocky start.  The reason for this is Alda.  He has the most annoying character in the film (I label him the Janet Jackson of this episode) for he is always trying to `preach' to everyone else.  Listen, I am all for sharing feelings and really bonding or whatever.  I am one of the most emotionally connected men you will ever meet and I pride myself in my ability to truly connect with my friends, on a deeper more meaningful level.  This guy is way too much though.  His toasts are ridiculous and they feel so forced that you can't take him seriously.  Later in the film, in the fourth season, he tells the group he wants to `get to the heart of things' and I became so frustrated with him I wanted to scream.WHO TALKS LIKE THAT???Anyways, the second season is far better.  It is probably the better season for it establishes Nick's new love interest and it gives us an idea of how everyone else feels about it.  Jack (Alda) also keeps his mouth shut with the whole `lets analyze our feelings' bit and so we have a chance to just enjoy the underlying emotions stewing in the pot (or on the boat if you will).The third season is the most important (especially when in regards to Nick and his ex-wife Anne).  It is also the season that makes the least sense.  There are a few things that happen over the course of this autumn vacation that raise questions.  First is the relationship between the women.  I don't know about you, but from my observation of women, they seem to be much more emotionally connected than men, and they stand up and stick by their friends much more than men do.  So, the very fact that Kate and Claudia have fallen out of touch with Anne to the point where she feels neglected makes no sense to me.  In all honesty, if this had been real life you can place money on the fact that Anne would be the one vacationing with the group, and not Nick.  I felt that Perry's film handled that aspect of things a little better (there is no way those women would be so civil with Nick so soon after the divorce); in fact I even feel that the way Kelly and Deacon's split on `The King of Queens' was handled more realistically than this was (I can't believe I just did that).  The next issue is the strange feud between Jack and Kate, which made little sense to me.  Maybe it wasn't supposed to make sense.  Maybe it was just to show that women at times can be crazy (no offence) but I just scratched my head thinking `really; all this over a football tackle?'The fourth and final season is a mixed bag.  They are skiing; they are having fun; Jack is back to his `analyzing' again and it is borderline excruciating; especially when they get out to dinner and Danny gets in on it.  That's the bad, but the final confrontation involving the group and Ginny (Nick's new wife) is actually really effective.  I was moved, slightly, and felt that it was the one note Alda hit perfectly.So it starts on a sour note, yet ends on a good one.The acting and character development is as poor as Perry's, maybe worse here.  I hated Jackson's character as much as Alda's, maybe more so; but Alda truly was repulsive here.  Carol Burnett was effective for the most part; but her character Kate was the emptiest of them all.  Danny's character was as bad as Alda; truly obnoxious; so much so that believing these guys would want to be friends with him is beyond me.  The first time he tallied up what I owed him for dinner would have been the last time we spoke; seriously.  Claudia, like Kate, feels empty.  She has a brief moment during the second season where I felt that she was going to really shine, but it was short lived.  In fact, the most likable and engaging of the characters are the two (especially the one) you are supposed to feel distant towards; Nick and Ginny.  Len Cariou plays his character very well and it's understandable why he's liked.  He's fun, outgoing, interesting and he never feels fake.  He is who he is, and he wants to be happy.  Ginny wants to fit in, although that is hard for her.  I also felt that Sandy Dennis, who plays Nick's ex Anne, was superb in her few scenes.  Her final scene with the girls is stellar on all accounts.So, in the end I feel torn here.  Overall the film is not that good, but in parts it works well.  It had a great concept but its execution was less than effective.  I want this movie to be made right, because I think that if done so it could be brilliant.  Alan Alda, like Tyler Perry, is too concerned with preaching to the rest of us than he is with developing realistic and intriguing characters.  This needs a director and screenwriter who is willing to take a backseat to the stories development; preferably someone who is not insistent in staring in the film.Oh well, this is just my opinion.",3,Alan Alda's: Why Did I Get Married?,1235692800,"02 27, 2009",2009,7067,"['Ha', 'think', 'should', 'be', 'able', 'draw', 'review', 'title', 'can', 'easily', 'compare', 'film', 'Tyler',

439111,ANGH6401L9Y0T,6304910150,"Barbara Frederick ""auntb93""","[2, 5]","A rather trivial movie, but sufficiently full of stars to be entertaining. Alan Alda plays Jack Burroughs, a lawyer, and Carol Burnett plays his wife. Jack Weston plays Danny Zimmer, a dentist, and Rita Moreno plays his Italian-American wife. Len Cariou plays Nick Callan, an insurance broker who refers to himself as an estate planner. Sandy Dennis plays Anne, his wife who is a neurotic photographer who makes superb photographs of vegetables.These three couples are in the habit of taking vacations together, and in the opening scenes, they are sharing a farm house in the country, celebrating how much they all love each other and how nothing can break them up. You know that is too good to last.During the vacation, Nick confides in Jack that after 21 years of marriage, he's planning to leave Anne. He says there's nobody ""waiting in the wings,"" but by their summer vacation renting a sailboat, he has brought along an adorable bikini-filling blonde named Ginny (Bess Armstrong). Needless to say, the group dynamics have changed drastically.The rest of the movie concerns a vacation in the fall to visit Beth Burroughs and Lisa Callan at college (both played by Alda daughters), when Anne shows up and checks into the hotel as Mrs. Callan. Since Nick has brought Ginny along in that capacity, things are seriously awkward.The fourth season is a skiing vacation, and I won't give away any details, just in case it is not all quite as predictable as I found it. Yes, there is humor and there is also pathos, but I had a hard time separating myself from the take-it-for-granted money that allows them to have such expensive vacations, not worry about arguments so loud that us lesser folk would get booted out of restaurants and hotels, and damage caused by temper tantrums. Money is simply not relevant to these people, and that's my limitation and not the movie's.As I said, funny but ultimately pretty trivial.",3,"Entertaining, but Pretty Trivial",1336694400,"05 11, 2012",2012,1916,"['rather', 'trivial', 'movie', 'sufficiently', 'full', 'stars', 'be', 'entertaining', 'Alan', 'Alda', 'Jack', 'Burroughs', 'lawyer', 'Carol', 'Burnett', 'wife', 'Jack', 'Weston', 'Danny', 'Zimmer', 'dentist', 'Rita', 'Moreno', 'Italian-American', 'wife', 'Len', 'Cariou', 'Nick', 'Callan', 'insurance', 'broker', 'who', 'estate', 'planner', 'Sandy', 'Dennis', 'Anne', 'wife', 'who', 'neurotic', 'photographer', 'who', 'superb', 'photographs', 'vegetables.These', 'three', 'couples', 'are', 'habit', 'taking', 'vacations', 'together', 'opening', 'scenes', 'are', 'sharing', 'farm', 'house', 'country', 'celebrating', 'how', 'much', 'love', 'other', 'how', 'nothing', 'can', 'break', 'up', 'know', 'too', 'good', 'last.During', 'vacation', 'Nick', 'Jack', '21', 'years', 'marriage', 'planning', 'leave', 'Anne', 'nobody', 'waiting', 'wings', 'summer', 'vacation', 'renting', 'sailboat', 'brought', 'adorable', 'bikini-filling', 'blonde', 'named', 'Ginny', 'Bess', 'Armstrong', 'Needless', 'say', 'group', 'dynamics', 'have', 'changed', 'drastically.The', 'rest', 'movie', 'vacation', 'fall', 'visit', 'Beth', 'Burroughs', 'Lisa', 'Callan', 'college', 'played', 'Alda', 'daughters', 'when', 'Anne', 'up', 'checks', 'hotel', 'Mrs.', 'Callan', 'Nick', 'brought', 'Ginny', 'along', 'capacity', 'things', 'are', 'seriously', 'awkward.The', 'fourth', 'season', 'skiing', 'vacation', 'wo', ""n't"", 'give', 'away', 'details', 'just', 'case', 'not', 'quite', 'as', 'predictable', 'found', 'Yes', 'humor', 'also', 'pathos', 'had', 'hard', 'time', 'separating', 'take-it-for-granted', 'money', 'have', 'such', 'expensive', 'vacations', 'not', 'worry', 'arguments', 'so', 'loud', 'lesser', 'folk', 'would', 'get', 'booted', 'restaurants', 'hotels', 'damage', 'caused', 'temper', 'tantrums', 'Money', 'simply', 'not', 'relevant', 'people', 'limitation', 'not', ""movie's.As"", 'said', 'funny', 'ultimately', 'pretty', 'trivial']",The Four Seasons VHS

However, Alan Alda's ""The Four Seasons"" has been one of my all-time favorite movies since I was a kid and watched it with friends. We decided that when we were grown we would do the same thing as the couples in this movie- take a vacation together every season. Unfortunately we did not end up sticking to that plan which is sad but also echoes the sentiment in the movie that friends pass out of your life for whatever reason- as Carol Burnett says: you realize they become just another pain in the ass and it becomes inconvenient to stay friends with them... This is sad but true. I never get tired of watching this film. It is so profound and so true to life that I feel like the characters were based on my life. The vulnerability of Alan Alda's character, the quirkiness of Jack Weston's, the humor of Carol Burnett's- all are so real and true to life. The script is perfect, the characters great and the cast amazing- one could not have asked for more. Vivaldi's music is the icing on the cake. This movie is beautifully written with such fantastic humorous dialogue that I could quote every line from it and never get tired of watching it. Rita Moreno and Len Cariou are also perfect in their roles. This is just a perfect little movie- I don't have one bad thing to say about it except I wish there were more- like 5 sequels!

439117,A3673NBQVA4J2M,6304910150,"Daniel Hayes ""D.R. Hayes""","[4, 30]","This is pretty much a waste of a movie if I ever saw one. I remember this one because It was one of the few movies I could get away with watching because it was during a point and time when all the movies that were coming out were rated ""R"", and I'm only 14 at the time. This showed Alda's character as somewhat henpecked as he was trying to be peaceful, and his significant other played by Carol Burnett was itching for a fight trying to get Alda's goat throughout the whole movie. I found this to be rather degrading, and violent especially when Alda finally snaps, and goes off on a tirade at the end which leads me to believe that it was Alda's character having the midlife crisis, and that Burnett's character had a tough time forgiving him, but let's put it this way it seems as though they spent too much time with friends, and not with one another, and it explodes at the end with a tirade of slamming things, breaking things, and a slew of obscenities that made you wonder if the character was getting turned on sexually while saying them, and if this was his way of coming. It shows a brief moment after the storm ends that they may begin to understand one another, but the ending shows that it's business as usual, and therefore it would've been better that Alda's and Burnett's characters never married.

439120,A13E0ARAXI6KJW,6304910150,Ed Uyeshima,"[7, 8]","Twenty-five years since its initial release, this 1981 comedy from Alan Alda, its director, writer and nominal star, still holds up pretty well. In fact, I just saw Norman Jewison's 2001 film, ""Dinner with Friends"", which feels like a partial remake in following the friendships that evolve among married couples hovering around middle age. Using Vivaldi's familiar string concertos as a transitional device, Alda's film concerns itself with three upscale couples who take vacations together every season, consequently we get four vignettes over the course of a year. It's a contrived plot machination with no sense of climax, but it all seems to fit the contours of the story.Jack is a lawyer who would like nothing more than have group therapy sessions with his friends, while his wife Kate, a magazine editor, is a no-nonsense woman who sometimes gets frustrated with Jack's constant emotional insulation. Danny is a neurotic, penny-pinching dentist married to Claudia, an artist with the hot temper of her Italian roots. Nick is a philandering insurance agent who wants to divorce his wife Anne, a housewife frozen by her self-doubts. It is the dissolution of this last marriage that provides the impetus for the group to examine the state of their relationships with their spouses and friends. The group starts out with a spring fishing trip when Nick confides to Jack about his need for a divorce, followed by a Caribbean summer boat trip when Nick brings his new nubile girlfriend Ginny, a wide-eyed stewardess. The fall has them visiting their kids in college, and a soccer match proves to be a test of wills among the men to prove their virility to Ginny much to the chagrin of the wives. The last piece takes them to a wintry cabin where true feelings are divulged, especially as Ginny exposes the women for their vindictive exclusionary tactics.The acting is solid. Alda seems to be doing a send-up of his own sensitive male persona as Jack, and a wisely cast Carol Burnett is actually pretty subtle as Kate. These two were such huge TV icons in the 1970's that the impact of their goodwill is almost instant. As the most comic pair, Rita Moreno and Jack Weston provide most of the laughs as they banter and bicker like Fred and Ethel Mertz redux. Broadway actor Len Cariou manages the insolence and liberation of a husband set free, while Sandy Dennis brings a palpable dimension of sadness to the socially ejected Anne. Bess Armstrong plays Ginny with an apt sunniness masking a burning need for acceptance. The story leads to little beyond a funny sight gag and an implication that Ginny will become more integral to the group, but the dialogue is often shrewdly observant and sometimes cannily witty. Alda doesn't quite have Woody Allen's sharp acumen in producing genuine laughs out of the human condition, but the film generates a good time while it lasts. The 2005 DVD has no extras.",4,Ingratiating Comedy Focuses on a Circle of Vacationing Married Friends,1154908800,"08 7, 2006",2006,2901,"['Twenty-five', 'years', 'initial', 'release', '1981', 'comedy', 'Alan', 'Alda', 'director', 'writer', 'nominal', 'star', 'still', 'up', 'pretty', 'well', 'fact', 'just', 'saw', 'Norman', 'Jewison', '2001', 'film', 'Dinner', 'Friends', 'partial', 'remake', 'following', 'friendships', 'evolve', 'married', 'couples', 'hovering', 'middle', 'age', 'Using', 'Vivaldi', 'familiar', 'string', 'concertos', 'transitional', 'device', 'Alda', 'film', 'concerns', 'three', 'upscale', 'couples', 'who', 'take', 'vacations', 'together', 'season', 'consequently', 'get', 'four', 'vignettes', 'course', 'year', 'contrived', 'plot', 'machination', 'sense', 'climax', 'fit', 'contours', 'story.Jack', 'lawyer', 'who', 'would', 'like', 'nothing', 'more', 'have', 'group', 'therapy', 'sessions', 'friends', 'wife', 'Kate', 'magazine', 'editor', 'no-nonsense', 'woman', 'who', 'frustrated', 'Jack', 'constant', 'emotional', 'insulation', 'Danny', 'neurotic', 'penny-pinching', 'dentist', 'married', 'Claudia', 'artist', 'hot', 'temper', 'Italian', 'roots', 'Nick', 'philandering', 'insurance', 'agent', 'who', 'divorce', 'wife', 'Anne', 'housewife', 'frozen', 'self-doubts', 'dissolution', 'last', 'marriage', 'impetus', 'group', 'examine', 'state', 'relationships', 'spouses', 'friends', 'group', 'out', 'spring', 'fishing', 'trip', 'when', 'Nick', 'Jack', 'need', 'divorce', 'followed', 'Caribbean', 'summer', 'boat', 'trip', 'when', 'Nick', 'new', 'nubile', 'girlfriend', 'Ginny', 'wide-eyed', 'stewardess', 'fall', 'visiting', 'kids', 'college', 'soccer', 'match', 'be', 'test', 'wills', 'men', 'prove', 'virility', 'Ginny', 'much', 'chagrin', 'wives', 'last', 'piece', 'wintry', 'cabin', 'where', 'true', 'feelings', 'are', 'divulged', 'especially', 'Ginny', 'women', 'vindictive', 'exclusionary', 'tactics.The', 'acting', 'solid', 'Alda', 'be', 'doing', 'send-up', 'own', 'sensitive', 'male', 'persona', 'Jack', 'wisely', 'cast', 'Carol', 'Burnett', 'actually', 'pretty', 'subtle', 'Kate', 'two', 'were', 'such', 'huge', 'TV', 'icons', '1970', 'impact', 'goodwill', 'almost', 'instant', 'most', 'comic', 'pair', 'Rita', 'Moreno', 'Jack', 'Weston', 'provide', 'most', 'laughs', 'banter', 'bicker', 'Fred', 'Ethel', 'Mertz', 'redux', 'Broadway', 'actor', 'Len', 'Cariou', 'insolence', 'liberation', 'husband', 'set', 'free', 'Sandy', 'Dennis', 'palpable', 'dimension', 'sadness', 'socially', 'ejected', 'Anne', 'Bess', 'Armstrong', 'Ginny', 'apt', 'sunniness', 'masking', 'burning', 'need', 'acceptance', 'story', 'little', 'funny', 'sight', 'gag', 'implication', 'Ginny', 'will', 'become', 'more', 'integral', 'group', 'dialogue', 'often', 'shrewdly', 'observant', 'sometimes', 'cannily', 'witty', 'Alda', ""n't"", 'quite', 'have', 'Woody', 'Allen', 'sharp', 'acumen', 'producing', 'genuine', 'human', 'condition', 'film', 'good', 'time', '2005', 'DVD', 'extras']",The Four Seasons VHS
439121,A3MQ3IIFGLQ2PO,6304910150,E. Hornaday,"[84, 88]","Alan Alda (best known as the wisecracking Hawkeye from the long-running TV series M*A*S*H*) wrote and directed this brilliant film which, for me, is the perfect homage to the successful marriage.The story centers around the close friendships of three middle-aged couples who always take their vacations together. A huge problem arises when one of the husbands (played with gusto by Len Cariou) abruptly sheds his longtime, devoted and quirky wife (played by the brilliantly gifted late actress Sandy Dennis) for a much younger and pretty woman (portrayed by Bess Armstrong.) Dennis suddenly becomes the odd-woman out of the group while Armstrong takes her place in the traditional group vacation.Everyone feels the effects of the switch, and their reactions and adjustments (or lack thereof) to the situation create the movie's tension and raise universal questions about love, commitment, marriage, honesty and aging.Alda's wife in the film, played by the legendary Carol Burnett, struggles to make sense out of what happened, and worries that all aging women (including her) may be cast aside without remorse by their husbands stuggling with the mid-life blues who want younger, sexier partners. In one revealing portion of the story, Alda joins in a soccer game ""with the boys"" and plays to the point of exhaustion and even injury to impress Armstrong. Burnett withholds her sympathy for her wounded mate and is furious instead, forcing him to realize what he was doing through witty, poignant and hysterical dialog.Multi-talented Rita Moreno and Jack Weston are the third couple also caught in the tortured but humorous and telling web of self analysis and doubt.Armstrong feels the tension from a completely different perspective, having fallen in love with a man who refuses to vacation alone and whose closest female friends refuse to accept her as part of the group but resent and mistrust her instead.The humor, and it is a very funny film, comes from the honesty the situation forces on the participants for them to be able to survive the vacation with their relationships and/or marriages intact.Ultimately, the younger woman is accepted on her own terms and the other couples understand more fully their love and dedication to their mates, while embracing true friendships with everyone in the group.Vivaldi's classic Four Seasons is the perfect soundtrack for the film and the inspiration for its title.I strongly urge anyone in a relationship, whether new or of long-duration, to see this film. It is very rare, indeed, when any studio produces a coming of age film FOR ADULTS that has humor, heart, respect for the middled-aged and absolutely NO teen angst!

Hart ""Sci-Fi Fan""","[27, 32]","In 1981, Alan Alda wrote and directed a film inspired by and named after a famous piece of classical music written by Antonio Vivaldi (1678-1741): ""The Four Seasons"".  The film's plot centers around three middle-aged couples who enjoy sharing vacations together: Jack Burroughs (Alan Alda), Kate Burroughs (Carol Burnette), Nick Callan (Len Cariou), Anne Callan (Sandy Dennis, 1937-1992), Claudia Zimmer (Rita Moreno) and Danny Zimmer (Jack Weston, 1924-1996). Each vacation occurs about every three months, beginning in the spring, then to the other three seasons; with each accompanied with Vivaldi's seasonal movement of music.  With each vacation, something new is learned about the various couples.  In the spring at a secluded lake, Nick reveals to Jack his desire to divorce Anne.  In the summer while vacationing on a sailboat in the Caribbean, Nick is no longer with Anne; instead he brings a young girlfriend named Ginny Newley (Bess Armstrong). With Nick constantly giving Ginny presents and keeping the other two couples up at night with their noisy activities, Jack & Danny find it difficult to keep their eyes off of Ginny to the consternation of Kate and Claudia.  With autumn, the three couples visit some of their college-aged children, Lisa (Elizabeth Alda) and Beth (Beatrice Alda), at a Connecticut university and get the unexpected visit from Anne. When Jack expresses his jealousy towards Nick while playing soccer, Kate expresses her unhappiness with his obessesion over Ginny as well as her tiring of being responsible for setting up the couples' vacations.  Lastly, in the winter, the three couples go on a ski trip.  There, the ongoing rivalry between Nick and Jack results in the two them being injured while trying to show off with inappropriate tricks on cross-country skis: Nick with a broken ankle and Jack with a torn tendon.  Following Danny expressing his fears of death, Ginny expresses her discontent with being the outsider and goes for a walk alone in the snow.  With Nick & Jack impaired, Danny decides to go and look for her; but he ends up falling through some thin ice.  It's then up to the other five to rescue the hypochondriac Danny, but it may cost him his most prized possession: his new Mercedes.With an interesting story, engaging characters, good acting, wonderful cinematography and appropriate music, ""The Four Seasons"" is well worth watching and I rate it with 5 out of 5 stars.  Though it was filmed nearly 25 years ago, the film is by no means dated as the issues that it raised then are just as relevant today with many middle-aged couples that have been together for a long time.",5,"""Is this the fun part?

The side-splitting role that Michael Caine played makes the whole move worth it as well.",5,Loved The Four Seasons !!!!!,1121126400,"07 12, 2005",2005,1039,"['print', 'was', 'excellent', 'plot', 'know', 'What', 'force', 'Alan', 'Alda', 'was', 'how', 'lucky', 'are', 'have', 'bit', 'left', 'history', 'heyday', 'Two', 'cast', 'Sandy', 'Dennis', 'Jack', 'Weston', 'are', 'no', 'longer', 'comedy', 'talent', 'forever', 'romp', 'three', 'couples', 'vacations', 'together.Len', 'Cariou', 'shines', 'selfish', 'emotionally', 'inept', 'Nick', 'Jack', 'Weston', 'hypocondriacal', 'dentist', 'Rita', 'Moreno', 'grounded', 'artist', 'wife', 'are', 'hilarious', 'Bess', 'Armstrong', 'beautiful', 'naive', 'Ginny', 'shines.I', 'loved', 'Carol', 'Burnett', 'Alan', 'Alda', 'more', 'sane', 'couple', 'comedy', 'How', 'fortunate', 'have', 'been', 'when', 'came', 'out', 'DVD.My', 'biggest', 'regret', 'did', ""n't"", 'have', 'second', 'disc', 'was', ""n't"", 'special', 'edition', 'surviving', 'cast', 'member', 'interviews', 'interviews', 'back', 'then.Take', 'time', 'buy', 'as', 'well', 'Alan', 'Alda', 'other', 'great', 'comedy', 'Same', 'Time', 'Next', 'Year', 'am', 'even', 'considering', 'getting', 'Sweet', 'Liberty', 'side-splitting', 'role', 'Michael', 'Caine', 'played', 'whole', 'move', 'worth', 'well']",The Four Seasons VHS
439155,A1LGTZGH7GMUAQ,6304910150,"Sonia ""Sonia Rumzi""","[1, 1]","Let's set aside for a moment that I adore Alan Alda and Carol Burnett both star in this wonderfully warm movie. A story of three couples who make plans to go away every season to do something different, skiing, sailing and so on. Their relationships change and get increasingly complex when one of the couples divorces and (Ginny) a young attractive partner enters the scene.The dialogue is charming and poignant. The arguments between the couples are realistic and pragmatic. The marital and divorce issues are real and intelligently dealt with.Alda and Burnett light up the screen with their presence and interaction. Rita Moreno is amazing in her role as an Italian wife married to a neurotic dentist Jack Weston.As for the scene where the newest couple are making out in the boat, I have tears running down my cheeks. And on finding them naked in the water Moreno suggests her husband is ""waiting for her to do the backstroke."" So funny!And to add to the wonderful atmosphere this movie creates for the watcher, the seasons changes come with Antonio Vivaldi's Four Season's violin music. With every season the music changes and I found myself smiling with the beautiful scenery. Although not a new movie, it is a worthwhile one.",5,"Reality, Marriage and Vivaldi to boot!",1378339200,"09 5, 2013",2013,1232,"['Let', 'set', 'aside', 'moment', 'adore', 'Alan', 'Alda', 'Carol', 'Burnett', 'star', 'wonderfully', 'warm', 'movie', 'story', 'three', 'couples', 'who', 'make', 'plans', 'go', 'away', 'season', 'do', 'something', 'different', 'skiing', 'sailing', 'so', 'relationships', 'change', 'get', 'increasingly', 'complex', 'when', 'one', 'couples', 'divorces', 'Ginny', 'young', 'attractive', 'partner', 'scene.The', 'dialogue', 'charming', 'poignant', 'arguments', 'couples', 'are', 'realistic', 'pragmatic', 'marital', 'divorce', 'issues', 'are', 'real', 'intelligently', 'dealt', 'with.Alda', 'Burnett', 'light', 'up', 'screen', 'presence', 'interaction', 'Rita', 'Moreno', 'amazing', 'role', 'Italian', 'wife', 'married', 'neurotic', 'dentist', 'Jack', 'Weston.As', 'scene', 'where', 'newest', 'couple', 'are', 'making', 'out', 'boat', 'have', 'tears', 'running', 'down', 'cheeks', 'finding', 'naked', 'water', 'Moreno', 'husband', 'waiting', 'do', 'backstroke', 'funny', 'add', 'wonderful', 'atmosphere', 'movie', 'watcher', 'seasons', 'changes', 'come', 'Antonio', 'Vivaldi', 'Four', 'Season', 'violin', 'music', 'season', 'music', 'changes', 'found', 'smiling', 'beautiful', 'scenery', 'not', 'new', 'movie', 'worthwhile', 'one']",The Four Seasons VHS

Nothing blows up, but instead The Four Seasons is about mid-life couples who go through the trials of growing older.  They prove that even us older folks have lives and actual feelings.I feel that this movie is a must see for us baby boomers.
