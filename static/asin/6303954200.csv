391747,A2C3MWVKGGBJFS,6303954200,Clob Lane,"[1, 1]","This comedy-thriller was so unexpectedly good, I was riveted the entire time to the screen. William Katt is great as Roger Cobb, a writer with definite writer's block. When his Aunt Elizabeth is found dead by suicide, he inherits her house (which he once lived in and lost his son). Now, as Roger begins writing again, he begins having nightmares and seeing terrifying visions which he believes are a sign that his son is still alive. George Wendt is actually very funny as the dozy next-door neighbour. The special effects are very imaginative and actually impressive. Overall, I'd HAVE to give this four stars for it's incredible ingenuity.

It has the *perfect* mix of horror&comdey.; It is genuinely scary at times&genuinely; funny at others. One TRUELY inspired moment is Roger Cobb(William Katt)with a shovel in the backyard with ""You're no good"" by Linda Ronstadt playing. Pure genius. As is the next sequence with a Shirelles song play.But anyways there were alot of moments I was creeped and and moments(totally seperate) where I was busting up laughing. Its pretty clever to, it wasn't entirely predictable and it was fairly thoughtfull as well. That's ALOT more than I can say for ""Return of the Living Dead(not a bad movie, but I think I enjoyed this a little more on some levels)"" or the ""Scary Movie"" series. Its well-acted as well. And that's *always* a plus.The plot involves Roger Cobb a horror novelist, recently divorced, who is working on his latest novel a recount of his days in Vietnam. When his Aunt days, committing suicide in her house. Where Roger grew up actually and where his son disapeared. He decides to move in there for some ""solitude"" and get cracking on his novel. And then because of one of his Aunts paintings he is prompted to check out her closet...But I wont divulge the story ANYMORE. And I can't say that you'll like because I'm not you. But I had to put in my two cents. So take a chance on house, I did. And I did myself have to sleep with the light on. And this coming from an 18yr.! :PSo if you're looking for a good horror movie or looking for some good laughs, look no further than ""House"". I haven't seen the sequels, but i here they're pretty aweful.

As a comedy-horror, ""House"" broke ground in the 1980s to set the bar higher for B movies. This was a must see B-horror when it came out. It is still good by today's standards, having stood the test of time.Good rock-n-roll sound track too. George Wendt as the quirky neighbor is classic, and William Katt, a very B actor, is perhaps in his finest performance (where's the Academy?). The baby sitting scene was one that I enjoyed as he tells the 3 year old, ""How would you like to play with a nice plastic bag?"" It is a must for any B horror movie collection.
