When I first saw it, I laughed out loud at a pairing of David Duchovney and Angelina Jolie, but after the third veiwing, the characters and the story began to grow on me. Duchovny and Jolie's chemistry actually works, and Timothy Hutton is crazy, colorful and quotable as a slightly sadistic crime lord. You'll get the gist of the story from previous reviews, but the important thing with this movie is to watch it tongue-in-cheek. It's entertaining, has a certain replay value, and has enough plot holes/unbelieveable happenings/goofy dialogue to warrent a double-play, and in my case, extensive nerd-ish study. What I've gleaned from the story and the character is basically: What goes around comes around.

I thought I would give it a chance. For one thing, I did not know that Angelina Jolie was in this film. It alone would have been enough reason to avoid it. I just don't like her. However, she was not that bad. David Duchovny is not convincing to me as a film star. He is too wooden and not versatile enough. He does not disappear into his roles, and to me, despite never really watching the X-Files, he will always be only Fox Mulder. As a doctor (which he plays in this film), Eugene Sands, I can maybe believe that. As a drug addict, not really. Somehow getting mixed up with some weird criminals, Timothy Hutton for one, who is a terrible criminal, is just not believable. He just does not have the face for it. Sands saves some guy who gets shot in a nightclub. Jolie (Hutton's girlfriend) sees it and is amazed. Sands goes home, gets high, and the next thing he knows, total strangers are in his house taking him away to meet someone. He meets counterfeiter Hutton and his girlfriend and entourage of bodyguards. All the while Duchovny treats us to some of his dimestore philosophy in the form of voiceovers.

It's a great noir film with good characters, performances, and direction. The story about conterfeiting and a doctor reluctantly hired as a mob doc is quite original, and at the same time, it achieves a great level of humor that is tried but not reached in many crime films. David D's performance is spot-on and he delivers his lines with gusto. Timothy Hutton has so much fun with his role that he eats up every scene he is in. A pre-FARGO Peter Stromare gives a very credible performance as a Russian counterfeiter and Angelina Jolie proves that she is a good actress even at the beginning of her career with the limited role that she is given. However, Hutton overshadows everyone else with his great line delivery and facial expressions. Some of the best lines of the film belong to him, and he gives them very well. Andy Wilson's direction is very good and suspenseful, and some of his more complicated shots work very well. He has a great sense of pacing and it works well for the film.

180803,A2NJO6YE954DBH,1558908439,Lawrance M. Bernabo,"[1, 2]","I think the best way to describe ""Playing God,"" the film that David Duchovny did during his summer off from ""The X-Files"" in 1977, is that the actor tried playing the self-destructive character who is the protagonist of the film and then reached a point where he decided it was better to have fun with the role.  What follows could not be considered to be too little, but it really does come too late for director Andy Wilson's film to really work.The premise is certainly interesting enough.  Dr. Eugene Sands (David Duchovny) is a defrocked doctor who lost his license to practice medicine when he tried performing surgery drugged out of his mind and killed a patient.  Down in the depths of despair Sands is out trying to score some heroin in a bar where bad things happen when something bad happens and one of the customers is blown away.  Sands offers the sage medical advice that 911 should be called, but it seems that would actually be a bad thing so he ends up doing a MacGuyver-style version of meatball surgery to save the guy.Two interesting things happen as a result of this incident.  The first is that Sands remembers that being a doctor was an even bigger rush than what he got from drugs.  The second is that Raymond Blossom (Timothy Hutton), who has lots of ill-gotten gain, arranges a meeting with Sands and gives him $10,000.  This is a way for Blossom to say thanks for saving his friend but it is also an invitation for Sands to be a doctor again.  He will not have a license, but he will get to practice medicine and on some rather interesting patients while some even more interesting interested parties look on.Complicating the offer is Gage (Michael Massee), an F.B.I. agent who knows about the deal that Blossom is giving Sands and wants to use that information to force little fish Sands to give him big fish Blossom.  Then there is Claire (Angelina Jolie), Blossom's mistress, who pouts at Sands in a provocative way.  But since Blossom is the sort of person who pays Sands to bring back someone from the dead just so they can be killed, trying to take Claire away from him is not going to be a good idea.  Of course, Sands will try.The best and worst scenes in this movie are a pair of surgery scenes that show that Duchovny's instincts on how to play the part are at odds with the initial drama.  The worst is when we flashback to see the botched surgery that cost Sands his license.  Show me just this clip and I would pass on seeing the movie.  The best is when Sands has to do another impromptu surgery, this time in a biker bar.  The setting, the characters, and the performances really work, but they run against the grain of the entire set up of the film.  But it represents the part of the film where Duchovny finally finds a way of making the character work.  The only thing wrong with this is that the wisecracking Sands does not really flow from the situation.Actually I rounded down on this one because I thought Timothy Hutton's over the top villain was too over the top.  I liked his coldly calculating moments a lot better than his ranting and raving madman moments, but it is the latter that comes to dominate the end of the film.  The climax tries to speak at some sort of friendship between the two that makes what has come to pass somewhat ironic, but no such relationship was really established here.Ultimately, Duchovny gets more of this film than the audience, because ""Playing God"" clearly teaches him where his strengths as an actor lie in making movies.  He has such an easy-going charm and wry sense of humor that you hope for his wife's sake he is not really acting.  In his follow up theatrical efforts, ""Return to Me,"" ""Evolution"" and ""Connie and Carla"" he clearly plays to his strong suits.  Unfortunately the limited release yesterday of ""House of D,"" written and directed by Duchovny, did not open here in the Zenith City.

Why David Duchovny, Timothy Hutton, and Anjelina Jolie decided to sign on for this film is the main thing I was thinking while I watched it.  The film starts off with Duchovny's character explaining he used to be a doctor, but now he is just a drug addict.  In the club where he is buying drugs a guy gets shot and Duchovny saves him.  This leads Timothy Hutton's character, a gangster of some sort, to track him down for further services.  This gets Duchovny mixed up with the wrong crowd who are in the midst of a gang war and an FBI sting operation.  Anjelina Jolie plays Hutton's girlfriend who eventually falls for Duchovny.This movie is laughable it is so bad.  Absolutly nothing is explained in the plot.  What does Hutton do?

Just as bad were the actors playing the minor roles.3) David Duchovny, Angelina Jolie, and Peter Stormare (who was great in Constantine) were given terrible lines.  What a waste of an AMAZING cast!It seems as though the actors/directors/producers got together for some drinks, and then decided, on the spot, to make a quick and easy impromptu film for some extra cash/spending money.Though the potential for a good movie was definitely there it fails to take off, primarily (but not exclusively) due to the writers.In a nutshell, it's an ok movie and that's about it; no masterpiece here...

180807,A15ORUD5TVNIV6,1558908439,Mom Pressfour,"[0, 4]","Boy howdy!  It's Perfessor Mom Pressfour, here to tell you about *Playing God* (1997).  This is a fast-paced LA crime thriller that owes a debt to the great film noirs of the 1940s.  It stars David Duchovny as Eugene, Timothy Hutton as Raymond, Angelina Jolie as Claire, Michael Massee as Gage, Peter Stormare as Vladimir, Andrew Tiernan as Cyril and Gary Dourdan as Yates.In 1997, after 3 years of playing FBI agent Fox Mulder in TV's *X-Files*, David Duchovny took time off to make *Playing God*.  Cast in the lead role, he was a drug-addicted surgeon disbarred from medical practice.  In 1996 Timothy Hutton played an LA bank robber alongside Harvey Keitel in a gritty neo-noir called *City of Industry*.  For the *Playing God* production, Hutton's criminal status was upped: now, in the supporting role, he was an LA underworld boss.  Angelina Jolie, still a newcomer to the business, was on her way to stardom.  Her part as the Hutton character's moll marks the point where the mainstream media started paying attention to her career.Some behind-the-scenes tidbits: though she was teamed with Duchovny, Jolie never watched *X-Files*--which at that time, of course, was one of the top TV series in the world.  Nontheless Duchovny was impressed by the young actress's professionalism. It's been rumored that Timothy Hutton and Ms Jolie became an item during the filming.  As far as I know neither one ever made a public comment about the relationship, if there really was one.A word about the acting.  David Duchovny isn't one of my favorites.  I wouldn't go so far as to say that in *Playing God* he turned in a wooden performance; it's just that, for an actor, his face isn't the most expressive.  It's an asset if you're playing an FBI agent.  That job calls for being cagey about what you're thinking.  But as Eugene, the doctor fallen from grace, Duchovny is supposed to convince us he's this brilliant, sensitive but tortured soul who, between periodic heroin swoons, ponders the meaning of existence.  About Hutton, he did very well in *City of Industry* as a small-time stickup man.  In *Playing God* he's supposed to be Raymond Blossom, the head of a multi-million-dollar copy-violations enterprise who runs with a team of professional killers.  Hutton just doesn't seem sinister enough for this.  Maybe he should have traded roles with Michael Massee, who plays the FBI agent trying to bring Raymond down.  Massee turns in a good performance, but for a cop he seems a trifle too oily.  Then there's Angelina Jolie as Claire, Raymond's squeeze.  It's the kind of part she excels at--an ultracool vamp,  dangerous yet born with a good heart.  Some moral confusion we never learn about has Claire consorting with evil. Is she evil herself?  Even Claire doesn't know.  Anyway, she's almost always dressed like a fashion model and the camera loves her for it.Claire: (shouting from the front bleachers at a Laker's basketball game) ""Take it to the hole!""Raymond: ""Oh baby, I love it when you talk dirty.""Ms Jolie said herself that Claire was one of her favorite early characters.  Trouble is, 1997 was a little TOO early for Hollywood's bigwigs to grant Jolie the screen time she needed to develop Claire to where we feel we really know her. Right up to the end she's just a dark, dreamily beautiful cypher.  (""I don't know what I've been,"" is all Claire admits to Eugene,)  A few years later Claire returned to the screen in another incarnation, as Julia/Bonny in *Original Sin* (2000).  Just as Claire is torn between a flawed good man (Eugene) and a suave bad man (Hutton), Julia/Bonny is torn between Luis and Billy.  Having ""arrived"" as an A-list actress, Jolie was able in *Original Sin* to fully flesh out this conflicted persona.Some reviewers dismiss *Playing God* as a lame and forgettable gangster flick.  To me it's a little gem.  As I said at the start, it owes a debt to such dark 1940s film noir classics as *Double Indemnity* and *The Big Sleep*.  For example, there's the philosophical voice-over narration.  At various points in the film Eugene speaks offscreen to the viewer.  He shares his thoughts about the chain of events in his life.  How those events  brought down an apparently good man.  So how do life events, good and bad, come to be?  Eugene believes they are caused by a person's own choices.  ""Each life is made up of big decisions, and each day is made up of a million little decisions...all these seemingly inconsequential choices might change your life forever.  But who can handle that kind of responsibility?  It would paralyze you to think about it.""  So rather than try to figure out with logic where your life is going, you have to trust your instincts, what the ancient Greek philosophers called character.  ""You better pray to whatever God you believe in that your character knows what the hell it's doing.""This is precisely where Eugene gets into trouble.  Instead of praying to God he plays God. (Hence the movie's title.)  God has authority over life and death.  A medical doctor is authorized to share in that divine authority.  For example he is authorized to use poisons (medicines and anaesthetics) and weapons (scalpels) on people, to give them back their lives...or in some cases to take their lives away.  Just like God.  But Eugene's authority was revoked. Criminal boss Raymond sympathetically steps up to take Eugene under his wing and make him an underworld doctor for gun-shot gangsters.  Underworld doctors don't report gunshot wounds to the police.  That's against the law.  It's likewise against the law to practice medicine after your license is taken away.  By choosing to break the law Eugene becomes a criminal, someone who ""plays God"" without authority.""It's a choice that's been offered to many men,"" Eugene tells us, ""to be a slave in heaven or a star in hell.  Of course I knew this was wrong.  But I'd been a surgeon.  On a big day, that can be like flying an F-14 when you are the pilot AND the plane.  I missed that.  And hell does not always look like hell.  On a good day it can look a lot like LA.""Still, Eugene isn't comfortable as the star surgeon of LA's underworld hell.  He can't quite bring himself to do as Raymond urges him: ""Embrace your criminal self!""  Claire senses this: ""Maybe he doesn't have a criminal self.""Yet it was Claire who first told Raymond about Eugene.  One night she'd been sitting with some friends in a gangster nightclub.  Eugene came in to score drugs.  Suddenly there was a shootout that left Isaac, one of Claire's companions, on the floor with a few bullets in his chest.  Using barroom ingredients, Eugene performed a makeshift operation that saved the guy's life.  Claire was very impressed.  Later that night, after Eugene had left, Raymond was likewise very impressed to hear about Eugene from Claire.  Especially since Isaac is one of Raymond's men.It's interesting to analyze the dynamics of the triangle.  Claire's attitude is that Eugene ought to be paid well for his services as a mob doctor.  But Raymond should not bring him into the inner circle where he will be party to Ray's criminal plans and secrets.  She disapproves of Eugene's addiction and thinks him untrustworthy.  Raymond, for his part, is fascinated by Eugene.  You get the impression that Raymond sees himself as an intelligent guy who's sick and tired of being around lowbrows all the time.  Witness the way he reacts to Vladimir (Peter Stormare), his Russian partner in crime. Vladimir accuses Raymond, ""You wanna cut us off?  Dump us in the lurch, or what?""  With a sigh Raymond corrects Vladimir's usage: ""It's 'in the ditch.' The expression is, 'in the ditch.'""  Vladimir snarls back, ""I don't care about any F*CKING expression, you got it?""  Raymond's face just registers weary exasperation.  He's thinking, ""Why do I have to be around idiots like this?""  That's the key to his enthusiasm for Eugene.  Raymond so identifies with his educated new friend that he gushes, ""I would have been a GREAT doctor.""  Eugene, of course, likes Raymond for giving him a chance to be a surgeon once more.  Plus Eugene is interested in Claire.Claire, apparently, is dismissive of Eugene: ""You must be somebody who's always on the lookout for a new way to f*ck up."" (Great line!)  And she's always cautioning Raymond: ""Be careful. Don't talk too much.""  When he answers that this is Eugene he's talking to, who's every bit as much an outlaw as we are, baby, she sarcastically asks, ""I'm sorry, is Eugene a full partner now?""  But it isn't as simple as it seems.  Actually it's Claire who wears the wire for the FBI.  Everything Raymond shares with HER is evidence.  She's pushing Eugene away because she doesn't want him to go down with Raymond when the bust comes.Raymond finally kills Vladimir.  In a cold rage Vladimir's boss Dimitri invades Raymond's pad and starts shooting.  Claire takes a bullet in the chest.  Trying to save her, Eugene finds the wire.  The corners of the triangle shift.  Eugene flees with helpless, bleeding Claire to a country hideaway.  On the way he performs another barroom operation to remove the bullet.  At last Eugene and Claire are shed of Raymond.  They look out for one another--he tends her wound, she's there for him while he kicks his habit. But they can't dodge the FBI for long.  Gage, the agent who is determined to bust Raymond, has plans for them.  Raymond does too.*Playing God* winds up with a car chase through the streets of LA that culminates in a final showdown in the middle of a highway.  But this typical-of-Hollywood action ending is not as gripping as the thickening atmosphere of suspense that leads up to it.  With a story that fires the mind, a snappy soundtrack, and tight editing, *Playing God* is never boring.  Duchovny and Hutton, though adequate, do not tap the full potential of their roles.  Jolie is outstanding.  For me, her performance as Claire is one of her best.",4,Hell does not always look like hell--on a good day it can look a lot like LA,1121817600,"07 20, 2005",2005,9917,"['Boy', 'howdy', 'Perfessor',

Duchovny's character could do a heart transplant on a Cadillac's hood if only you gave him a spork and bungee cord. Duchovny's absurd narration overdubs alone are priceless. Cliches are satirized mercilessly. One scene, where he's riding an elevator, has Duchovny internally opining about what it's like to be a surgeon. Try and make out his bizarre analogy between surgery and flying an F-14. It doesn't make a lick of sense, of course, but the whole thing is hilarious.Timothy Hutton -I think that's his name- plays the perfect comic badguy. The supposed gang war at the heart of this thing is totally absurdly dumb, but it makes for some great dialogue. Boris the Bulgarian was brilliant, all of his lines seemed to be delivered in mid-guffaw. Angelina Jolie seems to be the only one who's actually trying to convincingly act, but we can forgive her for that particular oversight. From script to acting to action, this movie is a plain ol' goofball fest from start to finish. Highly enjoyable.",5,Hilarious Farce,1033948800,"10 7, 2002",2002,1302,"['thought', 'was', 'going', 'hate', 'PLAYING', 'GOD', 'so', 'ridiculous', 'endearing', 'had', ""n't"", 'laughed', 'so', 'hard', 'while', 'one', 'preposterous', 'giggle-fest', 'start', 'finish', 'least', 'makers', 'knew', 'Completely', 'ludicrous', 'situations', 'develop', 'characters', 'encounter', 'hilarious', 'aplomb', 'Duchovny', 'character', 'could', 'do', 'heart', 'transplant', 'Cadillac', 'hood', 'only', 'gave', 'spork', 'bungee', 'cord', 'Duchovny', 'absurd', 'narration', 'alone', 'are', 'priceless', 'Cliches', 'are', 'satirized', 'mercilessly', 'One', 'scene', 'where', 'riding', 'elevator', 'Duchovny', 'internally', 'opining', 'what', 'be', 'surgeon', 'Try', 'make', 'out', 'bizarre', 'analogy', 'surgery', 'flying', 'F-14', ""n't"", 'make', 'lick', 'sense', 'course', 'whole', 'thing', 'hilarious.Timothy', 'Hutton', '-I', 'think', 'name-', 'perfect', 'comic', 'badguy', 'supposed', 'gang', 'war', 'heart', 'thing', 'totally', 'absurdly', 'dumb', 'great', 'dialogue', 'Boris', 'Bulgarian', 'was', 'brilliant', 'lines', 'seemed', 'be', 'delivered', 'mid-guffaw', 'Angelina', 'Jolie', 'be', 'only', 'one', 'who', 'actually', 'trying', 'convincingly', 'act', 'can', 'forgive', 'particular', 'oversight', 'script', 'acting', 'action', 'movie', 'plain', 'ol', 'goofball', 'fest', 'start', 'finish', 'Highly', 'enjoyable']",N/A

The answer: a film like this.  The composer is channeling some of the worst b-movie concepts in the history of the last few decades here.  There's a scene where Jolie gets shot that is so badly edited, directed, and scored you'll actually think it's intentionally botched...but I highly doubt it.  Someone criticized the Director of Photography, but I didn't see any indication of incompetence in that regard here.  The angles and shots you see in the final film are the fault of the director and the editor.  They're not poorly lit or underexposed, and the principles look fine.  The sets were also not bad, either.  I would say it was likely the script that appealed to the actors and, in all honesty, how bad could some Hollywood professionals mess up a concept like this?  A lot, it turns out.  On the plus side, Jolie is at her most photogenic in this.  You're only 21 once, after all.  It's unfortunate they got rid of the romance between the doctor and her, both for the skin potential and to add more weight to the conflict at the end.  In all likelihood the producers of this film simply got lucky when they happened to hire one really good casting director.",2,Huh...,1143331200,"03 26, 2006",2006,1300,"['What', 'can', 'get', 'good', 'script', 'good', 'acting', 'good', 'casting', 'poor', 'editing', 'poor', 'original', 'music', 'composition', 'so-so', 'direction', 'answer', 'film', 'composer', 'channeling', 'worst', 'b-movie', 'concepts', 'history', 'last', 'few', 'decades', 'here', 'scene', 'where', 'Jolie', 'shot', 'so', 'badly', 'edited', 'directed', 'scored', ""'ll"", 'actually', 'think', 'intentionally', 'botched', 'highly', 'doubt', 'Someone', 'criticized', 'Director', 'Photography', 'did', ""n't"", 'see', 'indication', 'incompetence', 'regard', 'here', 'angles', 'shots', 'see', 'final', 'film', 'are', 'fault', 'director', 'editor', ""'re"", 'not', 'poorly', 'lit', 'underexposed', 'principles', 'look', 'fine', 'sets', 'were', 'also', 'not', 'bad', 'either', 'would', 'say', 'was', 'likely', 'script', 'appealed', 'actors', 'honesty', 'how', 'bad', 'could', 'Hollywood', 'professionals', 'mess', 'up', 'concept', 'lot', 'out', 'plus', 'side', 'Jolie', 'most', 'photogenic', ""'re"", 'only', '21', 'once', 'unfortunate', 'got', 'rid', 'romance', 'doctor', 'her', 'skin', 'potential', 'add', 'more', 'weight', 'conflict', 'end', 'likelihood', 'producers', 'film', 'simply', 'got', 'lucky', 'when', 'happened', 'hire', 'one', 'really', 'good', 'casting', 'director']",N/A

180813,AN9TLUKFAJHP8,1558908439,Tung Yin,"[9, 10]","&quot;Playing God&quot; was supposed to be David Duchovny's breakout movie role; he had previously starred in movies such as &quot;Kalifornia&quot; and &quot;The Rapture,&quot; but &quot;Playing God&quot; came out at the  height of &quot;The X-Files&quot;'s popularity and acclaim.You can  understand what Duchovny was trying to do here, to get away from the  straight arrow yet weird role of Fox Mulder.  So he chooses the role of a  disgraced doctor whose license to practice medicine has been revoked due to  his substance abuse problems.  What's a guy supposed to do?Well, if you  hang out in seedy bars where gunfights break out, you demonstrate how handy  your skills can be to people who get shot and wounded a lot.  Kind of like  a black market surgeon.  That's how Duchovny gets hooked up with crime boss  Timothy Hutton.I had great expectations for this movie when it came out,  and while I was disappointed, I thought the critics were far harsher than  warranted.  True, Duchovny's performance, while not bad, seems very similar  to what he does on &quot;The X-Files,&quot; a sort of flat, somewhat wry,  never in real danger attitude.The biggest flaw with the movie has to be  the fact that it couldn't make up its mind about what it wanted to be, film  noir or dark comedy.  At times, it veers toward a &quot;Pulp  Fiction&quot;-like fascination with the minutia of being a criminal, while  at other times it tries (but fails) to evoke suspense and fear.  (For  example, there's a scene where some bad guys want him to fix up their dead  friend.  The way the scene is cut in the trailer, it comes across as funny  when Duchovny says, &quot;I'll see what I can do.&quot;  The way its cut in  the movie, there's an intervening line of dialogue where Duchovny seems to  be quite frightened; the effect of the following response is ruined.)  With  the excellent cast, it could have done either one competently; but its  attempt to do both fails.  Personally, I think the dark comedy would have  been the better way to go.  There's a scene near the end where Duchovny, in  an elevator surrounded by Asian tourists, does a deadpan response to an  annoying FBI agent that's the highlight of the movie.In summary, this is  a decent rental if you lower your expectations.",3,"Uneven, couldn't make up its mind about what it was",956707200,"04 26, 2000",2000,2275,"['quot', 'Playing', 'God', 'quot', 'was', 'supposed', 'be', 'David', 'Duchovny', 'breakout', 'movie', 'role', 'had', 'previously', 'starred', 'movies', 'such', 'quot', 'Kalifornia', 'quot', 'quot', 'Rapture', 'quot', 'quot', 'Playing', 'God', 'quot', 'came', 'out', 'height', 'quot', 'X-Files', 'quot', 'popularity', 'acclaim.You', 'can', 'understand', 'what', 'Duchovny', 'was', 'trying', 'do', 'here', 'get', 'away', 'straight', 'arrow', 'yet', 'weird', 'role', 'Fox', 'Mulder', 'So', 'role', 'disgraced', 'doctor', 'license', 'practice', 'medicine', 'been', 'revoked', 'due', 'substance', 'abuse', 'problems', 'What', 'guy', 'supposed', 'do', 'Well', 'hang', 'out', 'seedy', 'bars', 'where', 'gunfights', 'break', 'out', 'demonstrate', 'how', 'handy', 'skills', 'can', 'be', 'people', 'who', 'get', 'shot', 'wounded', 'lot', 'Kind', 'black', 'market', 'surgeon', 'how', 'Duchovny', 'hooked', 'up', 'crime', 'boss', 'Timothy', 'Hutton.I', 'had', 'great', 'expectations', 'movie', 'when', 'came', 'out', 'was', 'disappointed', 'thought', 'critics', 'were', 'far', 'harsher', 'warranted', 'True', 'Duchovny', 'performance', 'not', 'bad', 'very', 'similar', 'what', 'quot', 'X-Files', 'quot', 'sort', 'flat', 'somewhat', 'wry', 'never', 'real', 'danger', 'attitude.The', 'biggest', 'flaw', 'movie', 'be', 'fact', 'could', ""n't"", 'make', 'up', 'mind', 'what', 'wanted', 'be', 'film', 'noir', 'dark', 'comedy', 'times', 'quot', 'Pulp', 'Fiction', 'quot', 'fascination', 'minutia', 'being', 'criminal', 'other', 'times', 'evoke', 'suspense', 'fear', 'example', 'scene', 'where', 'bad', 'guys', 'want', 'fix', 'up', 'dead', 'friend', 'way', 'scene', 'cut', 'trailer', 'funny', 'when', 'Duchovny', 'quot', ""'ll"", 'see', 'what', 'can', 'do.', 'quot', 'way', 'cut', 'movie', 'intervening', 'line', 'dialogue', 'where', 'Duchovny', 'be', 'quite', 'frightened', 'effect', 'following', 'response', 'ruined', 'excellent', 'cast', 'could', 'have', 'done', 'one', 'competently', 'attempt', 'do', 'fails', 'Personally', 'think', 'dark', 'comedy', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'better', 'way', 'go', 'scene', 'end', 'where', 'Duchovny', 'elevator', 'surrounded', 'Asian', 'tourists', 'deadpan', 'response', 'annoying', 'FBI', 'agent', 'highlight', 'movie.In', 'summary', 'decent', 'rental', 'lower', 'expectations']",N/A
