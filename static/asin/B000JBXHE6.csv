1025700,A18BD98SU49UB7,B000JBXHE6,"Adam Hunnicutt ""A.H.""","[1, 2]","Forward:First off, major thanks to Palm pictures for sending me a screener of this film so that I could review it. Quite the honor.Review:Ernie Chin is on the edge of that dangerous chasm called puberty. He is stepping over the line from boyhood, when playing with the little sister turns into bullying of the Barbie mutulation kind. I remember as a young teen, my sister had this off-brand singing mermaid doll that would sing the same seven notes over and over again, so that my hand was forced in delivering the aquatic mer-person to her doom at the city dump. Nuff said.When we are between the ages 10 and 13, strange things occur, you ladies understand this as well. Our bodies begin to do wierd functions and hair sprouts out in the diverse places, and our hormones begin to become totally defunct - to put it mildly. Ernie is in this stage, where women are suddenly no longer just cootie farmers or moms, they are gloriously appealing - like some buried treasure suddenly unearthed from your own back yard. This is a little unsettling for Ernie's girl-friend (not girlfriend) Christine, who suddenly goes from pal to object of desire.At home, in the motel that he and his family both live and work in, there is civil unrest between he and his mother, which seems bent on emotionally beating him into submission; Though I never felt that she was aiming for pure cruelty. Rather, it seems that she is parenting with a tough-love-drill-sargeant philosophy, which many parents do. Her character seems to have experienced this in her own past, though its not stated. If the whole film could be most simply dichotomized, it is really about their relationship.One of the major highlights is the character played by Sung Kang from Tokyo Drift. He embodies a person who is empty and trying to fill the void with multiple prostitutes and lavish spending. His character is a knockout, and one of the better ones in recent memory. Loved his performance.There are some truly funny moments that happens on the motel grounds, which I will not spoil. Must find out for your self, says I.Motel is not been submitted to the MPAA for a rating, but if it were it would recieve an R. I can read the Motion Picture Association of America like a book, it would be something like this: Rated R for some strong sexual content/nudity, and language. So there you go.Motel truly is a really good film. I have watched short-subject pictures and rated them simply as they are, but I couldn't do this in Motel. I had to knock off a star, because I loved the characters so much that 70 minutes made me feel slightly cheated and unresolved on what could have been a warm-welcomed 2 hour visit with the Chins.",4,Right on the Chin,1175817600,"04 6, 2007",2007,2682,"['Forward', 'First', 'major', 'thanks', 'Palm', 'pictures', 'sending', 'screener', 'film', 'could', 'review', 'honor.Review', 'Ernie', 'Chin', 'edge', 'dangerous', 'chasm', 'called', 'puberty', 'stepping', 'line', 'boyhood', 'when', 'playing', 'little', 'sister', 'bullying', 'Barbie', 'mutulation', 'kind', 'remember', 'young', 'teen', 'sister', 'had', 'off-brand', 'singing', 'mermaid', 'doll', 'would', 'sing', 'same', 'seven', 'notes', 'over', 'again', 'hand', 'was', 'forced', 'delivering', 'aquatic', 'mer-person', 'doom', 'city', 'dump', 'Nuff', 'said.When', 'are', 'ages', '10', '13', 'strange', 'things', 'occur', 'ladies', 'understand', 'as', 'well', 'bodies', 'begin', 'do', 'wierd', 'functions', 'hair', 'sprouts', 'out', 'diverse', 'places', 'hormones', 'begin', 'become', 'totally', 'defunct', 'put', 'mildly', 'Ernie', 'stage', 'where', 'women', 'are', 'suddenly', 'no', 'longer', 'just', 'cootie', 'farmers', 'moms', 'are', 'gloriously', 'appealing', 'buried', 'treasure', 'suddenly', 'unearthed', 'own', 'back', 'yard', 'little', 'unsettling', 'Ernie', 'girl-friend', 'not', 'girlfriend', 'Christine', 'who', 'suddenly', 'pal', 'object', 'desire.At', 'home', 'motel', 'family', 'live', 'work', 'civil', 'unrest', 'mother', 'bent', 'emotionally', 'beating', 'submission', 'never', 'felt', 'was', 'aiming', 'pure', 'cruelty', 'Rather', 'parenting', 'tough-love-drill-sargeant', 'philosophy', 'many', 'parents', 'do', 'character', 'have', 'experienced', 'own', 'past', 'not', 'stated', 'whole', 'film', 'could', 'be', 'most', 'simply', 'dichotomized', 'really', 'relationship.One', 'major', 'highlights', 'character', 'played', 'Sung', 'Kang', 'Tokyo', 'Drift', 'person', 'who', 'empty', 'trying', 'fill', 'void', 'multiple', 'prostitutes', 'lavish', 'spending', 'character', 'knockout', 'one', 'better', 'ones', 'recent', 'memory', 'Loved', 'performance.There', 'are', 'truly', 'funny', 'moments', 'motel', 'grounds', 'will', 'not', 'spoil', 'Must', 'find', 'out', 'self', 'I.Motel', 'not', 'been', 'submitted', 'MPAA', 'rating', 'were', 'would', 'recieve', 'R.', 'can', 'read', 'Motion', 'Picture', 'Association', 'America', 'book', 'would', 'be', 'something', 'Rated', 'R', 'strong', 'sexual', 'content/nudity', 'language', 'So', 'there', 'go.Motel', 'truly', 'really', 'good', 'film', 'have', 'watched', 'short-subject', 'pictures', 'rated', 'simply', 'are', 'could', ""n't"", 'do', 'Motel', 'had', 'knock', 'off', 'star', 'loved', 'characters', 'so', 'much', '70', 'minutes', 'made', 'feel', 'slightly', 'cheated', 'unresolved', 'what', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'warm-welcomed', '2', 'hour', 'visit', 'Chins']",The Motel
1025701,A2FEGRJQNU51P9,B000JBXHE6,Joe Sherry,"[0, 0]","The Motel is a coming of age story which tells the story of Ernest Chin, a thirteen year old boy living and working at his family's motel.  It is clear he is interested in his fifteen year old friend, Christine, but she seems to treat him as a younger brother.  Ernest is trapped in his life (as one would expect from barely a teenager).  Ernest is just going into puberty and he is in a very awkward phase.  Sam Kin is a drifter of sorts who checks into the motel and somehow befriends Ernest and tries to mentor the boy, though in a unconventional sort of way.The Motel is a very low key movie, filled with humor, nostalgia, and sadness, but it is surprisingly good and moving.  Ernest is so awkward that we root for him to get something going in his life but understand why it is difficult for him.  This understated movie is well done and at a 80 minute run time, is worth the small time investment to see a different sort of coming of age movie.  There is nothing flashy here, but a decent movie which we do not see presented quite like this on the big screen.Note to parents: With the coming of age nature, there are some sexual situations and nudity...none of it with the children, but it is in the movie.

1025702,A1J1X0T9KP5YP3,B000JBXHE6,"Joyce Schwarz ""Joyce Schwarz""","[2, 2]","This is a quirky, charming and irreverent indy film that stars Jeffrey Chyau as Ernest Chinn a 13 year old Chinese-American boy whose family runs a seedy motel where he works the night shift. It has the feel of one of my old old cult favorites TELL ME THAT YOU LOVE ME JUNIE MOON...with a bit of Weekend at Bernie's tossed in and a bit of American Graffiti on the dark side. Can you imagine coming of age where sex and drugs and the bizarre are the rule rather than the random occurance. Chyau is amazing, stoic yet poignant, awkward yet wise beyond his years. Befriended by a Korean fast Eddie type dude crashing at his parents motel, he gets the first feelings of having a big brother or father yet that whiff is complex and unstable like the rest of his life. Chin proves that puberty sucks at any age and place. This film won the humanitarian prize at Sundance and it is humanity at its best and its worse. Why is it so hard to grow up? Chyau is a stubby chubby kid and that adds to the challenge especially today when so many kids are overweight and often overlooked by busy parents. Samantha Futerman (Memoirs of a Geisha) brings a sweetness to 15 year old Christine who is Chinn's first girlfriend or at least he yearns for her to be. The DVD includes cast audition tapes, behind the scenes featurettes and deleted scenes.

At the end of this movie you will feel that you didn't waste your time, but you might not want to pursue it.Actually, for a small budgeted indie film, this one does earn some points. The acting is superlative, the setting (a seedy motel that rents rooms by the hour) is genuine and the cinematography is honest.

1025704,A27H9DOUGY9FOS,B000JBXHE6,"K. Harris ""Film aficionado""","[6, 8]","""The Motel"" is, at once, totally familiar and shockingly different.  Its concept and themes relate to every coming-of-age film you've ever seen.  This low budget feature doesn't wrestle with any significant issues, it just presents a brief moment in time where its young protagonist begins to move away from childhood and assert his individuality.  The observations are small, the plot is slight, and most of the scenarios are commonplace.  But that doesn't mean this film lacks charm and originality.  For what is unique about ""The Motel"" is its environment.  Set in a seedy and dilapidated motel run by a Chinese American family, the film explores a rare topic--not just coming-of age in terms of manhood, but asserting yourself in America against the traditions of your family culture.The film follows Ernest Chin, an awkward 13 year old, who faces normal pubescent dilemmas.  He is pestered by a local bully, is secretly in love with his best girlfriend, and is starting to explore his sexual nature.  Through it all, he is expected to work cleaning rooms at the motel nonstop and his family doesn't support his academic and artistic interests--he has won an honorable mention in a writing contest (not even good enough to lose)!  When a young Korean man (Sung Kang) checks into the motel, Ernest is fascinated.  Hip and attractive, hard partying and successful with women--this childlike adult intrigues Ernest.  But it soon becomes clear that Kang is, also, a bit of a wreck--and he forms a relationship with Ernest because he needs someone to connect with, someone who will look up to him.  This relationship is, by far, the most dynamic element within ""The Motel.""  In fact, the rest of the picture pales in comparison to the energetic interplay whenever Kang is on the screen.There are some small, but not unexpected, revelations in ""The Motel.""  It is a slight and enjoyable story.  Jeffrey Chyau, as Ernest, is likable but can render certain line readings quite flat.  He does carry the story, however, and I suspect most will find him somewhat engaging.  To me, Kang gives a superlative performance in the film's most difficult role.  You'll like him, hate him, pity him, and completely understand Ernest's fascination with this complicated loser.  It is a star-making, revelatory performance and I hope to see a lot more from Kang.I did enjoy ""The Motel,"" for me it was about 3 1/2 stars.  It can be pleasant and humorous, but it is so modest in scope that it's not likely to linger.  I definitely look forward to director Michael Kang's next project--he's a talent with a distinct point of view.

It would be an R with the brief nudity, sexual situations, and occasional bad language (MF bomb).The film starts out on a light note with 13 year old Ernest eating an egg roll sitting on a dumpster outside a Chinese restaurant. He is smitten by a 15 year old girl working at the restaurant with whom he shares life and growing up experiences. Ernest is in love, while the girl (Christine) doesn't hold the same feelings.
