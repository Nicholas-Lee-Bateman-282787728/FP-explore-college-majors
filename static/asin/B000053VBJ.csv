565931,A1PASRZ81DY9C,B000053VBJ,Austin Somlo,"[2, 2]","Viewed: 1/11Rate: 61/11: Despite the negative criticisms, They Call Me MISTER Tibbs! is not bad of a film. I just think it needs to be re-titled because the movie has nothing to do with In the Heat of the Night. By doing that would just make things much easier for the audience. Oh yeah, get rid of that fatherly stuff. That's too distracting and unnecessary. Focus on the case and the boiling tension out of the issue. The rating of They Call Me MISTER Tibbs! would have been much better for it. Once again, Sidney Poitier creates a commanding presence in the film and steals the show from start to finish. He is the chief reason why the film is entirely watchable. I like the story, and my interest is sustained well despite a slow start and sluggish pacing at times. Another thing I like about the movie is the mix in of forensic analysis. It was fun to watch. Finally, the part with the son, wow...was that bad or was that bad? I wish that never occurred in the film; I could do without it for sure. All in all, They Call Me MISTER Tibbs! is a good film to watch to pass the time.",3,"Just Call It In the Light of the Heat, But Not That Ridiculous Title.",1294358400,"01 7, 2011",2011,1084,"['Viewed', '1/11Rate', '61/11', 'negative', 'criticisms', 'Call', 'Me', 'MISTER', 'Tibbs', 'not', 'bad', 'film', 'just', 'think', 'be', 're-titled', 'movie', 'nothing', 'do', 'Heat', 'Night', 'doing', 'would', 'just', 'make', 'things', 'much', 'easier', 'audience', 'Oh', 'yeah', 'get', 'rid', 'fatherly', 'stuff', 'too', 'distracting', 'unnecessary', 'Focus', 'case', 'boiling', 'tension', 'issue', 'rating', 'Call', 'Me', 'MISTER', 'Tibbs', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'much', 'better', 'Once', 'again', 'Sidney', 'Poitier', 'commanding', 'presence', 'film', 'show', 'start', 'finish', 'chief', 'reason', 'why', 'film', 'entirely', 'watchable', 'story', 'interest', 'sustained', 'well', 'slow', 'start', 'sluggish', 'pacing', 'times', 'thing', 'like', 'movie', 'mix', 'forensic', 'analysis', 'was', 'fun', 'watch', 'Finally', 'part', 'son', 'wow', 'was', 'bad', 'was', 'bad', 'wish', 'never', 'occurred', 'film', 'could', 'do', 'sure', 'Call', 'Me', 'MISTER', 'Tibbs', 'good', 'film', 'watch', 'pass', 'time']",N/A
565932,ANGH6401L9Y0T,B000053VBJ,"Barbara Frederick ""auntb93""","[0, 0]","Virgil Tibbs is the name of the cop. He is played by Sidney Poitier. But any connection with ""In the Heat of the Night"" is pretty remote. In that, he was a copy from Philadelphia, PA. Here, he is a cop in San Francisco, and discusses having known Rev. Logan Sharpe (Martin Landau) for something like 15 years. Since he is clearly not 15 years older than he was in his former role, there's been some distortion of the ""reality"" of Virgil Tibbs.Oh, well, Hollywood is like that.A prostitute has been murdered. Rev. Sharpe, a liberal minister who was a friend of the deceased, is heading up the ""home rule"" campaign to create local city halls in various sections of town because, as he points out, the neighborhoods have been swallowed up by bigness. There actually was such a proposition in San Francisco, actually raised several times. He was seen leaving her apartment on the day in question, and soon confesses to his friend Tibbs that he had indeed been to see her that day, and had been ""sleeping with her"" for the last few months. This was after attempting to convert her, and loaning her books on Christianity.But there are many reasons why other suspects must be considered, and Tibbs follows them all up. Ed Asner does a great job of playing a man who had been paying the girl's rent without the knowledge of his wife. There's her landlord, who obviously has lots to hide. Does it include murder? There are some big-time drug dealers, and a variety of other shady characters. But Virgil Tibbs sorts them all out.No, I'm not going to tell you who dunnit. Follow the evidence just like Lt. Tibbs did. It's not as good as ""In the Heat of the Night,"" but by the standards established for detective stories in San Francisco, it's pretty good.",3,Another Sequel That Does Not Live Up to the Original,1336953600,"05 14, 2012",2012,1744,"['Virgil', 'Tibbs', 'name', 'cop', 'played', 'Sidney', 'Poitier', 'connection', 'Heat', 'Night', 'pretty', 'remote', 'was', 'copy', 'Philadelphia', 'PA', 'Here', 'cop', 'San', 'Francisco', 'having', 'known', 'Rev', 'Logan', 'Sharpe', 'Martin', 'Landau', 'something', '15', 'years', 'clearly', 'not', '15', 'years', 'older', 'was', 'former', 'role', 'been', 'distortion', 'reality', 'Virgil', 'Tibbs.Oh', 'well', 'Hollywood', 'that.A', 'prostitute', 'been', 'murdered', 'Rev', 'Sharpe', 'liberal', 'minister', 'who', 'was', 'friend', 'deceased', 'heading', 'up', 'home', 'rule', 'campaign', 'create', 'local', 'city', 'halls', 'various', 'sections', 'town', 'because', 'out', 'neighborhoods', 'have', 'been', 'swallowed', 'up', 'bigness', 'actually', 'was', 'such', 'proposition', 'San', 'Francisco', 'actually', 'raised', 'several', 'times', 'was', 'seen', 'leaving', 'apartment', 'day', 'question', 'soon', 'confesses', 'friend', 'had', 'indeed', 'been', 'see', 'day', 'had', 'been', 'sleeping', 'last', 'few', 'months', 'was', 'attempting', 'convert', 'loaning', 'books', 'Christianity.But', 'are', 'many', 'reasons', 'why', 'other', 'suspects', 'must', 'be', 'considered', 'Tibbs', 'up', 'Ed', 'Asner', 'great', 'job', 'playing', 'man', 'who', 'had', 'been', 'paying', 'girl', 'rent', 'knowledge', 'wife', 'landlord', 'who', 'obviously', 'lots', 'hide', 'include', 'murder', 'are', 'big-time', 'drug', 'dealers', 'variety', 'other', 'shady', 'characters', 'Virgil', 'Tibbs', 'out.No', ""'m"", 'not', 'going', 'tell', 'who', 'dunnit', 'Follow', 'evidence', 'just', 'Lt.', 'Tibbs', 'did', 'not', 'as', 'good', 'Heat', 'Night', 'standards', 'established', 'detective', 'stories', 'San', 'Francisco', 'pretty', 'good']",N/A

Martin Landau co-stars. The film could have used more character and plot development, particularly in the scenes involving Virgil's domestic life. I felt that it was a little too long, though to be fair, that is a reflection based on that I wasn't too interested in seeing the movie today (though I've been interested in it ever since I read about it years ago).
