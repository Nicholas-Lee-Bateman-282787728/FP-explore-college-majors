287608,A1GGOC9PVDXW7Z,6301978374,Annie Van Auken,"[0, 0]","Set in the 1600s, Rouben Mamoulian's QUEEN CHRISTINA is considered by many to be Greta Garbo's best film. It is if one accepts this as a total work of fiction, perhaps.The real Christina was mistaken for a boy at birth, and when this error was discovered was still raised as a son and called ""prince."" She had her father's homely looks and was proficient in such manly activities as horseback riding, fencing and shooting. Crowned ""king"" at age six, Christina's education was tailored for a male royal, with tutoring in religion, philosophy, Greek and Latin. Her teachers said she had a male temperament.Christina's autobiography reveals she never wished to marry and that the usual concerns of women were foreign to her. Contemporaries believed her to be gay-- more likely Christina was transgendered. She courted beautiful women, wore a mixture of male and female attire, moved, spoke and behaved as a man, having many male comrades (not lovers).After abdicating the throne at age 28 in favor of her cousin Charles, Christina traveled extensively for many years in France and Italy.The movie version of this unusual royal gives only a couple of hints as to her gender identity and sexuality. The script instead chooses to center around a fictional love affair with a Spanish ambassador. It's well done but historically VERY unsatisfying. The real Christina was far more interesting than Garbo's. A great opportunity to tell her fascinating story was squandered in this pre-Code motion picture.As for Greta Garbo, she was a fine actress with a hard, angular face that's especially noticeable in her portrayal of the manly Christina.John Gilbert was often paired with Garbo in silent photoplays and he's with her here for the last time. Gilbert's acting career was not (as is claimed) destroyed by his voice --which was fine-- but from a severe case of alcoholism, plus quarrels with MGM directors and their bosses who then actively sabotaged him. He made one more movie after ""Christina"" and died in 1936 of an alcohol-induced heart attack. John Gilbert was 36 years old at time of death..Parenthetical number preceding title is a 1 to 10 IMDb viewer poll rating.(7.9) Queen Christina (1933) - Greta Garbo/John Gilbert/Ian Keith/Lewis Stone/Elizabeth Young/C.

The production and direction values are simply wonderful. And best of all, though Garbo no longer lived with John Gilbert, she demanded that Louis B. Mayer hire Gilbert as her romantic co-star. The result is magic, for both stars. Gilbert is fabulous, his voice is at the very least comparable to Ronald Coleman.

Ten or fifteen years ago I considered ""Queen Christina"" Garbo's best work. Today I am not so sure, to my regret and disappointment.The failure, in my opinion, stands in the over-presence, idolizing of the Garbo image, so much so that the plot, script, everything else practically becomes irrelevant. Can the weight of the great, (wonderful, I must admit) Garbo balance neatly with the quality of the picture? No. The movie starts weak, pretentious, a little theatrical, then it grows in tone, more ambition and a little more depth; towards the end one feels you have been watching a wonderful movie all through and can't get your eyes off the screen. And that's when she acts her greatest scene: on the ship, facing the mysterious horizon, with the sea breeze on her sphinx face, and her eyes... oh, her eyes!Yeah, folks. This is classic cinema, and I'm not whistling dixie here. It's all worth it, only for those culminating minutes. And as one cannot separate an arm from a body and expect to grow from it another body, one cannot separate the end from the rest of the film. That is why this is a great classic movie.N.B.

287611,ABH4G7TVI6G2T,6301978374,Byron Kolln,"[1, 1]","QUEEN CHRISTINA (1933) was the first movie which Greta Garbo made as part of a secret development deal with MGM studios.  Other stars like Clark Gable had campaigned without success to head their own production units inside the MGM gates.  When it became clear that Garbo wouldn't submit to the same rules and restrictions as other contract players, a deal was brokered so that she would continue--under a reduced workload--as one of MGM's most valuable box office attractions during the lean years of the Depression.With a script tailored by good friend Salka Viertel and sensitive direction from Rouben Mamoulian (with whom she'd later have a torrid affair), QUEEN CHRISTINA is one of Garbo's most effective and personal films, the story of Sweden's legendary Queen Christina, a woman renowned for her affairs with both sexes.  The character's bisexual leanings--painted so blatantly in Garbo's scenes with Elizabeth Young (as Christina's lady-in-waiting)--leave precious little doubt as to their true relationship.QUEEN CHRISTINA also marked the end of Garbo's screen partnership with John Gilbert.  Although the two had enjoyed a long-standing relationship off the screen (exploited to tremendous effect in such silent classics as ""Love"" and ""Flesh and the Devil""), it had ended by the time that Gilbert played Don Antonio to Garbo's Christina.  He sadly passed away three years after his performance.Regarded by most as Garbo's greatest performance, QUEEN CHRISTINA deserves a place in every classic movie collection.",4,Garbo's most sensitive screen performance,1243123200,"05 24, 2009",2009,1522,"['QUEEN', 'CHRISTINA', '1933', 'was', 'first', 'movie', 'Greta', 'Garbo', 'made', 'part', 'secret', 'development', 'deal', 'MGM', 'studios', 'Other', 'stars', 'Clark', 'Gable', 'had', 'campaigned', 'success', 'head', 'own', 'production', 'units', 'MGM', 'gates', 'When', 'became', 'clear', 'Garbo', 'would', ""n't"", 'submit', 'same', 'rules', 'restrictions', 'other', 'contract', 'players', 'deal', 'was', 'brokered', 'so', 'would', 'continue', 'reduced', 'workload', 'one', 'MGM', 'most', 'valuable', 'box', 'office', 'attractions', 'lean', 'years', 'Depression.With', 'script', 'tailored', 'good', 'friend', 'Salka', 'Viertel', 'sensitive', 'direction', 'Rouben', 'Mamoulian', 'whom', ""'d"", 'later', 'have', 'torrid', 'affair', 'QUEEN', 'CHRISTINA', 'one', 'Garbo', 'most', 'effective', 'personal', 'films', 'story', 'Sweden', 'legendary', 'Queen', 'Christina', 'woman', 'renowned', 'affairs', 'sexes', 'character', 'bisexual', 'leanings', 'painted', 'so', 'blatantly', 'Garbo', 'scenes', 'Elizabeth', 'Young', 'Christina', 'lady-in-waiting', 'leave', 'precious', 'little', 'doubt', 'true', 'relationship.QUEEN', 'CHRISTINA', 'also', 'marked', 'end', 'Garbo', 'screen', 'partnership', 'John', 'Gilbert', 'two', 'had', 'enjoyed', 'long-standing', 'relationship', 'screen', 'exploited', 'tremendous', 'effect', 'such', 'silent', 'classics', 'Love', 'Flesh', 'Devil', 'had', 'ended', 'time', 'Gilbert', 'played', 'Don', 'Antonio', 'Garbo', 'Christina', 'sadly', 'passed', 'away', 'three', 'years', 'performance.Regarded', 'most', 'Garbo', 'greatest', 'performance', 'QUEEN', 'CHRISTINA', 'place', 'classic', 'movie', 'collection']",Queen Christina VHS

Chandler ""baseball doctor""","[0, 1]",".....The picture got better when pressure was put upon the Queen to send her Latin lover home and to marry a Swede who would give her an heir to the throne.  Garbo turned in some fine acting as she agonized over her final decision to abdicate and to leave with her lover......The movie is interesting to movie buffs because Garbo and Gilbert had been real life lovers.  They met on the set of Flesh and the Devil when Gilbert was a Silent Film star and Garbo an unknown newcomer.  They lived together for three years but Gilbert wanted marriage and children and Garbo just wanted them to live together.  Finally when she refused his final marriage proposal, Gilbert broke off the relationship and married another actress......When sound movies became popular some actors like Gilbert had their careers destroyed while others like Garbo were instant hits and became mega stars.  Louis B. Mayer, the head of MGM had originally signed Lawrence Olivier to play the part of Antonio in Queen Christiana but Garbo, in an attempt to help Gilbert's sagging career, told Mayer that she would make the movie with Gilbert and nobody else.  Mayer, who hated Gilbert and had vowed to destroy his career, gave in to Garbo's demands and cast them together for the last time.  Two years later Gilbert was dead at the age of 36......Garbo led a twisted and tormented life and was most likely AC/DC but she probably loved Gilbert as much as she was capable of loving any man and he came the closest to getting her to the altar.",5,GARBO AND GILBERT FOR THE LAST TIME,1279843200,"07 23, 2010",2010,1508,"['..The', 'picture', 'got', 'better', 'when', 'pressure', 'was', 'put', 'Queen', 'send', 'Latin', 'lover', 'home', 'marry', 'Swede', 'who', 'would', 'give', 'heir', 'throne', 'Garbo', 'turned', 'fine', 'acting', 'agonized', 'final', 'decision', 'abdicate', 'leave', 'lover', 'movie', 'interesting', 'movie', 'buffs', 'Garbo', 'Gilbert', 'had', 'been', 'real', 'life', 'lovers', 'met', 'set', 'Flesh', 'Devil', 'when', 'Gilbert', 'was', 'Silent', 'Film', 'star', 'Garbo', 'unknown', 'newcomer', 'lived', 'together', 'three', 'years', 'Gilbert', 'wanted', 'marriage', 'children', 'Garbo', 'just', 'wanted', 'live', 'together', 'Finally', 'when', 'refused', 'final', 'marriage', 'proposal', 'Gilbert', 'broke', 'off', 'relationship', 'married', 'actress', 'When', 'sound', 'movies', 'became', 'popular', 'actors', 'Gilbert', 'had', 'careers', 'destroyed', 'others', 'Garbo', 'were', 'instant', 'hits', 'became', 'mega', 'stars', 'Louis', 'B.', 'Mayer', 'head', 'MGM', 'had', 'originally', 'signed', 'Lawrence', 'Olivier', 'play', 'part', 'Antonio', 'Queen', 'Christiana', 'Garbo', 'attempt', 'help', 'Gilbert', 'sagging', 'career', 'told', 'Mayer', 'would', 'make', 'movie', 'Gilbert', 'nobody', 'else', 'Mayer', 'who', 'hated', 'Gilbert', 'had', 'vowed', 'destroy', 'career', 'gave', 'Garbo', 'demands', 'cast', 'together', 'last', 'time', 'Two', 'years', 'later', 'Gilbert', 'was', 'dead', 'age', '36', 'Garbo', 'led', 'twisted', 'tormented', 'life', 'was', 'most', 'likely', 'AC/DC', 'probably', 'loved', 'Gilbert', 'as', 'much', 'was', 'capable', 'loving', 'man', 'came', 'closest', 'getting', 'altar']",Queen Christina VHS
287613,A3I7OX03X6KDMN,6301978374,"Chris Roberts ""Chris Roberts""","[3, 7]","As I continued my quest through Greta Garbo's career I came across this film, a big sweeping historical romance that has a pure heart but a very dry tongue. The story involves the Queen of Sweden (Garbo) who rules over a people that are not too bright and advisors that are constantly clamoring for war. Early on Christina calls off the war in the name of the peasants which leaves the warmongers frothing at the mouth. Decisions like this serve to make her character more likeable and little else as the political landscape she presides over has no real consequences. The romantic part of the story kicks in one night when Christian is out and about and gets marooned inside a cabin thanks to a massive snowfall. Also in the cabin are a bunch of drunken Spaniards, and one, Don Antonio (John Gilbert) who is especially attractive. The catch is that this guy believes she is a he, and since he believes it she seems to magically morph into a male. I know that if you need a she to play a he Garbo is your girl, but she makes no effort to hide her femininity so I found this scene to be extremely unlikely. But no matter. Once they are alone she is outed as a female but not as a queen, they fall in love and then must separate.The thing about historical romances is that it is always the history driving the wedge between the lovebirds, be it a sinking ship or King Charles. So of course Don Antonio is the advisor to King Charles, and of course he has his royal eye on Christina. This all comes to pass when Don Antonio pays a visit to Christina's castle not knowing that she is queen. His presence has negative effects almost immediately. The masses, never known for their smarts, start riots outside over the thought of their queen doing it with a foreigner (who even knew Swedish nationalism existed?). Then, like now, the people were only able to take an interest in politics if it involved a sex scandal that they could be outraged (!) about. Her other lover around the castle gets jealous and we see lots of squabbling, an aspect that was reminiscent of the ""Elizabeth I"" movie from earlier this year. The ending of the film is actually quite refreshing. For once we see a person look around and realize that the cost of her position is more than she is interested in paying. We humans love to sell out without thinking, here Christina does the opposite. It was not enough to save the film for me. The dealings for castle politics got to be a drag fairly quickly. I also simply don't believe Garbo in this role. She always seems mysterious and haunting, not powerful and appealing. So while the film is perfectly enjoyable I'm giving it a mild thumbs down. I didn't believe the filmmakers when they told me that Christina rose above her position, but I did believe them when they told me she was leaving it. The sad thing is that there is a good movie in here somewhere, just director Rouben Mamoulian couldn't get the story engine humming fast enough to find it. ***",3,Heavy Hangs Garbo's Head,1164412800,"11 25, 2006",2006,2974,"['continued', 'quest', 'Greta', 'Garbo', 'career', 'came', 'film', 'big', 'sweeping', 'historical', 'romance', 'pure', 'heart', 'very', 'dry', 'tongue', 'story', 'Queen', 'Sweden', 'Garbo', 'who', 'rules', 'people', 'are', 'not', 'too', 'bright', 'advisors', 'are', 'constantly', 'clamoring', 'war', 'Early', 'Christina', 'war', 'name', 'peasants', 'warmongers', 'frothing', 'mouth', 'Decisions', 'serve', 'make', 'character', 'more', 'likeable', 'little', 'else', 'political', 'landscape', 'real', 'consequences', 'romantic', 'part', 'story', 'kicks', 'one', 'night', 'when', 'Christian', 'out', 'marooned', 'cabin', 'thanks', 'massive', 'snowfall', 'Also', 'cabin', 'are', 'bunch', 'drunken', 'Spaniards', 'one', 'Don', 'Antonio', 'John', 'Gilbert', 'who', 'especially', 'attractive', 'catch', 'guy', 'magically', 'morph', 'male', 'know', 'need', 'play', 'Garbo', 'girl', 'effort', 'hide', 'femininity', 'found', 'scene', 'be', 'extremely', 'unlikely', 'matter', 'are', 'alone', 'outed', 'female', 'not', 'queen', 'fall', 'love', 'then', 'must', 'separate.The', 'thing', 'historical', 'romances', 'always', 'history', 'driving', 'wedge', 'lovebirds', 'be', 'sinking', 'ship', 'King', 'Charles', 'So', 'course', 'Don', 'Antonio', 'advisor', 'King', 'Charles', 'course', 'royal', 'eye', 'Christina', 'pass', 'when', 'Don', 'Antonio', 'visit', 'Christina', 'castle', 'not', 'knowing', 'queen', 'presence', 'negative', 'effects', 'almost', 'immediately', 'masses', 'never', 'known', 'smarts', 'start', 'riots', 'outside', 'thought', 'queen', 'doing', 'foreigner', 'who', 'even', 'knew', 'Swedish', 'nationalism', 'existed', 'Then', 'now', 'people', 'were', 'only', 'able', 'take', 'interest', 'politics', 'involved', 'sex', 'scandal', 'could', 'be', 'outraged', 'other', 'lover', 'castle', 'jealous', 'see', 'lots', 'squabbling', 'aspect', 'was', 'reminiscent', 'Elizabeth', 'movie', 'earlier', 'year', 'ending', 'film', 'actually', 'quite', 'refreshing', 'once', 'see', 'person', 'look', 'realize', 'cost', 'position', 'more', 'interested', 'paying', 'humans', 'love', 'sell', 'out', 'thinking', 'here', 'Christina', 'opposite', 'was', 'not', 'enough', 'save', 'film', 'dealings', 'castle', 'politics', 'got', 'be', 'drag', 'fairly', 'quickly', 'also', 'simply', 'do', ""n't"", 'believe', 'Garbo', 'role', 'always', 'mysterious', 'haunting', 'not', 'powerful', 'appealing', 'So', 'film', 'perfectly', 'enjoyable', ""'m"", 'giving', 'mild', 'thumbs', 'down', 'did', ""n't"", 'believe', 'filmmakers', 'when', 'told', 'Christina', 'rose', 'position', 'did', 'believe', 'when', 'told', 'was', 'leaving', 'sad', 'thing', 'good', 'movie', 'here', 'somewhere', 'just', 'director', 'Rouben', 'Mamoulian', 'could', ""n't"", 'get', 'story', 'engine', 'humming', 'fast', 'enough', 'find', '***']",Queen Christina VHS

""Queen Christina"" is one of the handful of films which rise to her level.The films tells of the abdication of Christina of Sweden when she fell in love with a Spanish nobleman. The film starts slowly and not very well establishing Christina's persona as a peace maker surrounded by a court of ambitious war mongers. When it shifts into romance and the usual problem of royalty in films, loyalty and responsibility to country versus personal needs, it improves immeasurably. Garbo is subjected to a barrage of close ups by the director Rouben Mamoulian but they are carefully placed and she survives magnificently, superbly conveying her changing emotions. The object of her love is John Gilbert, a giant silent screen star and ex-lover of Garbo, but here towards the end of his career. He is not completely convincing as a worthy object of her desires. He looks  popeyed and weedy. The film has 2 very famous scenes - when Garbo ""remembers"", filmed to the rhythm of a metronome, the room where she and Gilbert slept together and the ending at the bow of the ship when her blank face is scrutinised and the audience fill in the blanks. The film is sumptuously made in the MGM manner and there is an excellent supporting cast, particularly C Aubrey Smith.The film's print is dirty and obviously unrestored.

287616,A2FOT0QE23VN6J,6301978374,Dr. James Gardner,"[1, 2]","There was a brief time and place when the silent films had faded and talkies had begun, yet the people who survived the transition brought to the screen a sensitivity and level of emotion that has not been equaled since. Such is the value of Garbo's performance in ""Queen Christina"". Christina was Garbo's 8th talkie. Prior to this Garbo had been in nearly 20 silent films, starting as early as 1920. Her best known silent films were ""Flesh and the Devil"" (1926) which was directed by Clarence Brown, and ""Love"" (1927) in which she co-starred with John Gilbert. She was nominated 3 times for an Oscar (""Anna Christie"", ""Camille"", and ""Ninotchka"") but never won. She is listed #5 on the AFI's list of Greatest Actresses.John Gilbert co-stars, but his name appears in small print under the title. Quite a difference from the first time he and Garbo worked together. Their last film together had been in 1928 (""A Woman of Affairs"") and in that time Garbo had become one of the top screen personalities and Gilbert's career had declined, partially due to his soured relationship with MGM head Louie Mayer. But Gilbert never managed to make the transition to talkies complete. Even in Queen Christina you'll find his performance and even his appearance to be more appropriate for the silent screen.There are some talented actors in this film, though most of them are wasted. C. Aubrey Smith and Akim Tamariff play aides.  Smith was a marvelous actor known for his roles as an aristocrat, though he plays an aide to Garbo here. He appeared in more than 100 films from 1915 to 1949. He gave us memorable roles in a host of films, including Major Hamilton in ""The Lives of a Bengal Lancer"" (1935), Lord Capulet in ""Romeo and Juliet"" (1936), and Colonel Zapt in ""The Prisoner of Zenda"" (1937). I remember him best as Col. Williams in ""Wee Willie Winkie"" (1937) with Shirley Temple.Tamiroff is best remembered for his role as the Uncle Joe in Orson  Welles ""Touch of Evil"" (1958) and twice was nominated for Best Supporting Actor (""For Whom the Bell Tolls"" and ""The General Died at Dawn""). He plays an aide to Gilbert. Does an adequate job, but his talents are wasted.Lewis Stone plays Garbo's court adviser. He was a major star in the 20s and 30s and was nominated for an Oscar for ""The Patriot"" (1930). Between 1914 and 1953 he made more than 150 films; his memorable roles were as the warden in ""The Big House"" (1930), Doctor Otternschlag in ""Grand Hotel"" (1932), Commissioner Smith in ""The Mask of Fu Manchu"" (1932), and ""Doc"" in ""Three Godfathers"" (1936). He's probably best known for his continuing role as Judge Hardy in the Andy Hardy films (1937-46).Reginald Owen gives his usual good performance as Garbo's cousin and a military leader, but he's on screen far too little and barely says a word. He's best known as Ebenezer Scrooge from ""A Christmas Carol"" (1938) and made nearly 100 films including ""Mary Poppins"" (1964) and ""Bedknobs and Broomsticks"" (1971).Rouben Mamoulian directs. Mamoulian made only 20 films, most of them in the 30s. Queen Christina was his 6th film. Prior to this he'd had success with ""Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde"" (1931) and Marlene Dietrich's ""Song of Songs"" (1933). Mamoulian was known for his agile camera work and this style is amply demonstrated throughout the film. Visually the film is a treat, although at times the narrative does lag.Walter Wagner produced this lavish film, complete with many outdoor scenes. In Wagner's 34 year career he was responsible for more than 60 films, such as the Marx Brothers first talkie ""Cocoanuts"" (1929), Fritz Lang's ""Scarlet Street"" (1945), Ingrid Bergman's ""Joan of Arc"" (1948), Susan Hayward's ""I Want to Live"" (1958), and Elizabeth Taylor's ""Cleopatra"" (1963). Cleopatra was his last film and the only one for which he was nominated for an Oscar.Williams Daniels is the cinematographer. Garbo insisted he shoot all her films, which he did, except for 2 (""Conquest"", ""Two-faced Woman"") which turned out to be flops at the box office. When not working with Garbo, Daniels was a favorite of Erich von Stroheim, who was Garbo's favorite director (even though she made 6 films with Brown). Daniels lensed more than 150 films. He was nominated 3 times (""Anna Christie"", ""Cat on a Hot Tin Roof"", ""How the West was Won"") and won once (""Naked City"" in 1948).The film received good reviews and was a box office hit. For Garbo fans it is certainly a must see and I think it's her best performance, although her presence in virtually every scene does get overpowering. The final shot is a long close up of Garbo's face. It took nearly 50 years for any actor to match the power of this final scene (Klaus Maria Brandauer in ""Mephisto"").",4,Garbo Glares,1282780800,"08 26, 2010",2010,4693,"['was', 'brief', 'time',

287618,A2PR6NXG0PA3KY,6301978374,Giordano Bruno,"[3, 3]","That's what it offers... glamour! The 1930s, that era of the Great Depression, had glamour figured out. Black-and-white cinematography somehow out-glamours color, the sound-stage painted backdrops of Sweden in winter out-glamour the most brilliant computer simulations of today, the langourous flow of sustained scripted scenes out-glamours the quick cuts and fades of current movie-making, and above all Greta Garbo out-glamours anyone in film history. Garbo was ineffably, soulfully gorgeous. Her acting skills, learned in the silent era, were more stagey than the current fashion approves, but she had magical presence on the screen. John Gilbert, the 'fading' silent star whom she demanded as her leading man in this production, was even stagier and perhaps campier in the role of the Spanish Ambassador for whom the Queen abandoned her throne, but he also had glamour, a Prince Charming presence. All in all, ""Queen Christina"" is a glamourous fairy tale, an operatic opening-night pageant of languid beauty.The film ""Queen Christina"" is roughly as faithful to Swedish history as the film ""Jaws"" to the novel ""Moby Dick"". Hey, they were both about fish! If you want a factual biography of KING Christina Vasa, the most famous woman in 17th C Europe as well as perhaps the most interesting, you'll learn more from five minutes' reading on wikipedia. If you want a plausible depiction of events and society during the Thirty Years War, stick to the writings of Grimmelshausen and stay clear of Hollywood. The passionate love story at the heart of this film is pure invention. Christina's abdication was not an elopement, and it was just the beginning of the most compelling portions of her life. Her years as a girl King under the management of Axel Oxenstierna are in fact rather obscure, and her roughly eight-year reign as her own monarch was anything but successful. In reality, she bankrupted the regency by transfering most of her royal funds into the hands of the greedy nobility, resulting in a concentration of wealth and land-ownership that primed Sweden for centuries of maldistribution, exploitation of the peasantry, and stagnation. Swedish history, until the rise of the labor movement, was a laboratory for the failure of 'pure' capitalism, as absolutely nothing ""trickled down"". The truly important half of Christina's famous life took place in her years of exile in Italy and France, where she became arguably the greatest Patron of music of the Baroque era, yet music isn't mentioned in the film. Likewise she became easily the most prominent ""convert"" from Lutheranism to Catholicism; her prominence as a convert, indeed, was so great that her glaring unorthodoxy of belief and of lifestyle was beyond any correction that Papacy might have desired to impose. She was, in short, an 'untouchable' freethinker, an icon of independence for the boldest figures of the next generation. One could, with just a flare of hyperbole, call Christina the first ""modern"" woman.But back to Garbo! There was an obvious motive for casting the Swedish actress, at the height of her fame, in the role of the Swedish monarch, aside from which the two women may well have had much in common. Garbo's voice, with her Swedish accent quite well modulated, was still a throaty alto, a voice that might have commanded male councilors, a sensuous but plainly masculine voice. Christina WAS raised, in effect, as a man; she did dress as a man at times, sit and walk like a man, dispense with niceties and proprieties like a man. Both Christina and Garbo have been plausibly 'identified' as bi-sexual in orientation. Christina was patently a woman of superior intellect, and one gets the impression that Garbo, who had virtually no school education, was a deep thinker by Hollywood norms. Possibly this similarity of 'being' was what enabled Garbo to occupy the role of Christina so fully. For my mother's generation, Garbo was Christina, and many soulful young beauties aspired to be Garbo.",5,Glamour!,1284508800,"09 15, 2010",2010,3983,"['what', 'glamour', '1930s', 'era', 'Great', 'Depression', 'had', 'glamour', 'figured', 'out', 'Black-and-white', 'cinematography', 'somehow', 'out-glamours', 'color', 'sound-stage', 'painted', 'backdrops', 'Sweden', 'winter', 'out-glamour', 'most', 'brilliant', 'computer', 'simulations', 'today', 'langourous', 'flow', 'sustained', 'scripted', 'scenes', 'quick', 'cuts', 'fades', 'current', 'movie-making', 'Greta', 'Garbo', 'out-glamours', 'anyone', 'film', 'history', 'Garbo', 'was', 'ineffably', 'soulfully', 'gorgeous', 'acting', 'skills', 'learned', 'silent', 'era', 'were', 'more', 'stagey', 'current', 'fashion', 'approves', 'had', 'magical', 'presence', 'screen', 'John', 'Gilbert', ""'fading"", 'silent', 'star', 'whom', 'demanded', 'leading', 'man', 'production', 'was', 'even', 'stagier', 'perhaps', 'campier', 'role', 'Spanish', 'Ambassador', 'whom', 'Queen', 'abandoned', 'throne', 'also', 'had', 'glamour', 'Prince', 'Charming', 'presence', 'Queen', 'Christina', 'glamourous', 'fairy', 'tale', 'operatic', 'opening-night', 'pageant', 'languid', 'beauty.The', 'film', 'Queen', 'Christina', 'roughly', 'as', 'faithful', 'Swedish', 'history', 'film', 'Jaws', 'novel', 'Moby', 'Dick', 'Hey', 'were', 'fish', 'want', 'factual', 'biography', 'KING', 'Christina', 'Vasa', 'most', 'famous', 'woman', '17th', 'C', 'Europe', 'as', 'well', 'perhaps', 'most', 'interesting', ""'ll"", 'learn', 'more', 'five', 'minutes', 'reading', 'wikipedia', 'want', 'plausible', 'depiction', 'events', 'society', 'Thirty', 'Years', 'War', 'stick', 'writings', 'Grimmelshausen', 'stay', 'clear', 'Hollywood', 'passionate', 'love', 'story', 'heart', 'film', 'pure', 'invention', 'Christina', 'abdication', 'was', 'not', 'elopement', 'was', 'just', 'beginning', 'most', 'compelling', 'portions', 'life', 'years', 'girl', 'King', 'management', 'Axel', 'Oxenstierna', 'are', 'fact', 'rather', 'obscure', 'roughly', 'eight-year', 'reign', 'own', 'monarch', 'was', 'anything', 'successful', 'reality', 'bankrupted', 'regency', 'transfering', 'most', 'royal', 'funds', 'hands', 'greedy', 'nobility', 'resulting', 'concentration', 'wealth', 'land-ownership', 'primed', 'Sweden', 'centuries', 'maldistribution', 'exploitation', 'peasantry', 'stagnation', 'Swedish', 'history', 'rise', 'labor', 'movement', 'was', 'laboratory', 'failure', ""'pure"", 'capitalism', 'absolutely', 'nothing', 'trickled', 'down', 'truly', 'important', 'half', 'Christina', 'famous', 'life', 'took', 'place', 'years', 'exile', 'Italy', 'France', 'where', 'became', 'arguably', 'greatest', 'Patron', 'music', 'Baroque', 'era', 'yet', 'music', ""n't"", 'mentioned', 'film', 'Likewise', 'became', 'easily', 'most', 'prominent', 'convert', 'Lutheranism', 'Catholicism', 'prominence', 'convert', 'indeed', 'was', 'so', 'great', 'glaring', 'unorthodoxy', 'belief', 'lifestyle', 'was', 'correction', 'Papacy', 'might', 'have', 'desired', 'impose', 'was', 'short', ""'untouchable"", 'freethinker', 'icon', 'independence', 'boldest', 'figures', 'next', 'generation', 'One', 'could', 'just', 'flare', 'hyperbole', 'call', 'Christina', 'first', 'modern', 'woman.But', 'back', 'Garbo', 'was', 'obvious', 'motive', 'casting', 'Swedish', 'actress', 'height', 'fame', 'role', 'Swedish', 'monarch', 'aside', 'two', 'women', 'may', 'well', 'have', 'had', 'much', 'common', 'Garbo', 'voice', 'Swedish', 'accent', 'quite', 'well', 'modulated', 'was', 'still', 'throaty', 'alto', 'voice', 'might', 'have', 'commanded', 'male', 'councilors', 'sensuous', 'plainly', 'masculine', 'voice', 'Christina', 'WAS', 'raised', 'effect', 'man', 'did', 'dress', 'man', 'times', 'sit', 'walk', 'man', 'dispense', 'niceties', 'proprieties', 'man', 'Christina', 'Garbo', 'have', 'been', 'plausibly', ""'identified"", 'bi-sexual', 'orientation', 'Christina', 'was', 'patently', 'woman', 'superior', 'intellect', 'one', 'impression', 'Garbo', 'who', 'had', 'virtually', 'no', 'school', 'education', 'was', 'deep', 'thinker', 'Hollywood', 'norms', 'Possibly', 'similarity', ""'being"", 'was', 'what', 'enabled', 'Garbo', 'occupy', 'role', 'Christina', 'so', 'fully', 'mother', 'generation', 'Garbo', 'was', 'Christina', 'many', 'soulful', 'young', 'beauties', 'aspired', 'be', 'Garbo']",Queen Christina VHS

The film follows their romance from their first chance meeting through their full blown love affair to its final tragic conclusion. Real life is often stranger than fiction.Greta Garbo, a native of Sweden, is positively glorious as this most unusual of Queens, giving a performance that is intelligent, complex, and passionate, with a touch of whimsy interjected. John Gilbert, Garbo's real life, handsome ex-lover, is excellent in the part of Don Antonio, a man conflicted by his mission on behalf of his king and his passion for Christina.Queen Christina, too, is conflicted, as she does not wish to enter into a political marriage of convenience with Swedish war hero, Prince Charles Gustavus (Reginald Owen). This is the marriage that the people of Sweden seem to want and one that is being fostered by both her Chancellor, Axel Oxenstierna (Lewis Stone), and her former lover, Count Magnus (Ian Keith). Nor does she wish to marry the Spanish King. Instead, she wishes to marry for love. So, she does the unthinkable. She abdicates for love, creating shock waves that reverberate throughout the courts of Europe, and arranges to leave her native Sweden with Don Antonio and head for Spain.The best-laid plans, however, often go awry. Jealousy rears its ugly head, when Count Magnus realizes that his affair with Christina is over and that Don Antonio now has her affection. It is he who throws the final monkey wrench into their plans to live happily ever after. Who, having seen this film, can forget Garbo's last scene as Christina, the Queen who lost everything in the final analysis: her throne, her lover, and her future. Her last close-up in this film is unforgettable and one that will long linger in the memory of the viewer. Never was Garbo more luminous or soulful.This is a movie classic that will be enjoyed and appreciated by those who love vintage films, as well as historical dramas.",5,WHAT I DID FOR LOVE...,1041724800,"01 5, 2003",2003,2118,"['vastly', 'entertaining', 'film', 'enigmatic', 'cross', 'dressing', '17th', 'Century', 'Queen', 'Sweden', 'who', 'abdicated', 'throne', 'love', 'Spaniard', 'Spanish', 'Envoy', 'Swedish', 'Court', 'Don', 'Antonio', 'De', 'La', 'Prada', 'film', 'romance', 'first', 'chance', 'meeting', 'full', 'blown', 'love', 'affair', 'final', 'tragic', 'conclusion', 'Real', 'life', 'often', 'stranger', 'fiction.Greta', 'Garbo', 'native', 'Sweden', 'positively', 'glorious', 'most', 'unusual', 'Queens', 'giving', 'performance', 'intelligent', 'complex', 'passionate', 'touch', 'whimsy', 'interjected', 'John', 'Gilbert', 'Garbo', 'real', 'life', 'handsome', 'ex-lover', 'excellent', 'part', 'Don', 'Antonio', 'man', 'conflicted', 'mission', 'behalf', 'king', 'passion', 'Christina.Queen', 'Christina', 'too', 'conflicted', 'not', 'wish', 'enter', 'political', 'marriage', 'convenience', 'Swedish', 'war', 'hero', 'Prince', 'Charles', 'Gustavus', 'Reginald', 'Owen', 'marriage', 'people', 'Sweden', 'seem', 'want', 'one', 'being', 'fostered', 'Chancellor', 'Axel', 'Oxenstierna', 'Lewis', 'Stone', 'former', 'lover', 'Count', 'Magnus', 'Ian', 'Keith', 'wish', 'marry', 'Spanish', 'King', 'Instead', 'marry', 'love', 'So', 'unthinkable', 'love', 'creating', 'shock', 'waves', 'reverberate', 'courts', 'Europe', 'leave', 'native', 'Sweden', 'Don', 'Antonio', 'head', 'Spain.The', 'best-laid', 'plans', 'however', 'often', 'go', 'awry', 'Jealousy', 'ugly', 'head', 'when', 'Count', 'Magnus', 'affair', 'Christina', 'Don', 'Antonio', 'now', 'affection', 'who', 'final', 'monkey', 'wrench', 'plans', 'live', 'happily', 'ever', 'Who', 'having', 'seen', 'film', 'can', 'forget', 'Garbo', 'last', 'scene', 'Christina', 'Queen', 'who', 'lost', 'everything', 'final', 'analysis', 'throne', 'lover', 'future', 'last', 'close-up', 'film', 'unforgettable', 'one', 'will', 'long', 'linger', 'memory', 'viewer', 'Never', 'was', 'Garbo', 'more', 'luminous', 'soulful.This', 'movie', 'classic', 'will', 'be', 'enjoyed', 'appreciated', 'who', 'love', 'vintage', 'films', 'as', 'well', 'historical', 'dramas']",Queen Christina VHS

It also has that odd cheapness that MGM would sneak into their bloated frou frou -- many exteriors are obviously painted backdrops of the snowy Swedish countryside and look like Christmas cards.  The famous ""I am remembering this room"" scene(she has just spent a passionate night with her love and walks around the room caressing objects in it) is laughable as is the scene where Christina stomps out into the early morning and washes her face with snow.  Whatever the ""snow"" was made of, it makes crunching/crackling sounds.  But there's no denying that Garbo was a mesmerizing creature.  Her beauty was extraordinary, her presence radiant.

The highlights are numerous, but notable among them is the scene where she undresses in the inn, to the surprise and delight of the Spanish envoy, Antonio. The  next sequence is a curtained bed at the break of dawn. Hmmm, wonder what  happened in between time? Another moving scene occurs as the queen  addresses her subjects. Her consternation, coupled with love and agony, is  both poignant and subtle as she speaks to her people &quot;who are said to  love [her], but do not wish [her] to be happy.&quot; The final shot is  poetry in action, captured for the ages. The ship has set sail, and Garbo,  st the stern, the wind rustling around her- she, who feels freedom and yet  has tasted sorrow and despair, is framed like the Mona Lisa- subtle,  sublime, sensuous- somewhere between the extremes of human passion, she  becomes art- transfixed in a moment that shines above the commonplace and  reaches for the extrodinary. Here she is at her pinnacle. Here is the  moment- preserved and completed- never to be equaled or repeated.

287626,A3BSS2M2DPPV4T,6301978374,"""scotsladdie""","[8, 9]","Many film buffs agree that this film is the quintessential Garbo movie. The film was tailored especially for the star, and Garbo felt a certain spiritial affinity in playing a monarch of her homeland who lived from 1626-1689. To vintage-film TV watchers, this film is strangely obscure, yet this just might be Garbo's greatest performance (at least a close tie to CAMILLE) in her finest Hollywood film. Like the actress herself, her Christina inspires awe as much as adoration - it is a stunning performance, with her the closing shot being one of the most famed in the history of motion pictures. Salka Viertel, a friend of Garbo, tailored the part for her friend - (Garbo had spent 18 months vacationing in Sweden prior to filming this) - and her Christina is a fascinating, ambiguous, charismatic incarnation. The lustre of this production wasn't dimmed in the least by the equally romanticised albeit easily forgotton THE ABDICATION which starred Liv Ullmann in 1974. The movie owes a great deal of its taste and visual flair to its director, Rouben Mamoulian and the film isn't nearly as dated as one would suppose. The beautifully lit photography by William Daniels is excellent, the sets are eloquent and well-chosen supporting cast is first-rate. Twenty-six year-old Laurence Olivier was originally chosen to play Don Antonio, but he was replaced by John Gilbert, Garbo's former vis-a-vis, both on screen and off. This is his best-preserved sound performance; he would be dead at 38 three years later. QUEEN CHRISTINA met with widespread critical enthusiasm - as did Garbo's fine characterization of her countrywoman - but the film did not tickle the fancy of the hoi polloi during the depths of the depression, and it did badly and the box office, nor it win the awards it merited.",5,QUEEN OF SWEDEN,998438400,"08 22, 2001",2001,1790,"['Many', 'film', 'buffs', 'agree', 'film', 'quintessential', 'Garbo', 'movie', 'film', 'was', 'tailored', 'especially', 'star', 'Garbo', 'felt', 'certain', 'spiritial', 'affinity', 'playing', 'monarch', 'homeland', 'who', 'lived', '1626-1689', 'vintage-film', 'TV', 'watchers', 'film', 'strangely', 'obscure', 'yet', 'just', 'might', 'be', 'Garbo', 'greatest', 'performance', 'least', 'close', 'tie', 'CAMILLE', 'finest', 'Hollywood', 'film', 'actress', 'Christina', 'awe', 'as', 'much', 'adoration', 'stunning', 'performance', 'closing', 'shot', 'being', 'one', 'most', 'famed', 'history', 'motion', 'pictures', 'Salka', 'Viertel', 'friend', 'Garbo', 'tailored', 'part', 'friend', 'Garbo', 'had', 'spent', '18', 'months', 'vacationing', 'Sweden', 'prior', 'filming', 'Christina', 'fascinating', 'ambiguous', 'charismatic', 'incarnation', 'lustre', 'production', 'was', ""n't"", 'dimmed', 'least', 'equally', 'romanticised', 'easily', 'THE', 'ABDICATION', 'starred', 'Liv', 'Ullmann', '1974', 'movie', 'great', 'deal', 'taste', 'visual', 'flair', 'director', 'Rouben', 'Mamoulian', 'film', ""n't"", 'nearly', 'as', 'dated', 'one', 'would', 'suppose', 'beautifully', 'lit', 'photography', 'William', 'Daniels', 'excellent', 'sets', 'are', 'eloquent', 'well-chosen', 'supporting', 'cast', 'first-rate', 'Twenty-six', 'year-old', 'Laurence', 'Olivier', 'was', 'originally', 'chosen', 'play', 'Don', 'Antonio', 'was', 'replaced', 'John', 'Gilbert', 'Garbo', 'former', 'vis-a-vis', 'screen', 'off', 'best-preserved', 'sound', 'performance', 'would', 'be', 'dead', '38', 'three', 'years', 'later', 'QUEEN', 'CHRISTINA', 'met', 'widespread', 'critical', 'enthusiasm', 'did', 'Garbo', 'fine', 'characterization', 'countrywoman', 'film', 'did', 'not', 'tickle', 'fancy', 'hoi', 'polloi', 'depths', 'depression', 'did', 'badly', 'box', 'office', 'awards', 'merited']",Queen Christina VHS

Wherever your personal preference rests however I believe the splendid ""Queen Christina"", would rate high on most people's list of Garbo's greatest. It is without a doubt one of Garbo's most luminious starring vehicles and contains some of the most famous visual images of Garbo ever caught on film. The role of Sweden's controversial 17th Century Queen who gave up the throne for love was a natural for Garbo; an actress who seemed to defy the standard norms of love and marriage during her reign as one of Hollywood's greatest stars. Everything about this production works in my belief from the casting of Garbo as one of her own most famous countrywomen who had an almost masculine persona about her, to the superb photography by Garbo's favourite cameraman William Daniels who captured during this film some of the most enduring visual images of the great Garbo ever recorded on film. Certainly this effort really began Garbo's incredible run of tragic historical heroines that included ""Anna karenina"", ""Camille"", and ""Conquest"" that all featured women doomed by their love for a man.",5,Garbo In One Of Her Most Unforgettable Roles,1116115200,"05 15, 2005",2005,1215,"['think', 'most', 'fans', 'enigmatic', 'Greta', 'Garbo', 'difficult', 'task', 'pick', 'what', 'consider', 'be', 'best', 'movie', 'personal', 'preference', 'however', 'believe', 'splendid', 'Queen', 'Christina', 'would', 'rate', 'high', 'most', 'people', 'list', 'Garbo', 'greatest', 'doubt', 'one', 'Garbo', 'most', 'luminious', 'starring', 'vehicles', 'most', 'famous', 'visual', 'images', 'Garbo', 'ever', 'caught', 'film', 'role', 'Sweden', 'controversial', '17th', 'Century', 'Queen', 'who', 'gave', 'up', 'throne', 'love', 'was', 'natural', 'Garbo', 'actress', 'who', 'seemed', 'defy', 'standard', 'norms', 'love', 'marriage', 'reign', 'one', 'Hollywood', 'greatest', 'stars', 'Everything', 'production', 'belief', 'casting', 'Garbo', 'one', 'own', 'most', 'famous', 'countrywomen', 'who', 'had', 'almost', 'masculine', 'persona', 'superb', 'photography', 'Garbo', 'favourite', 'cameraman', 'William', 'Daniels', 'who', 'captured', 'film', 'most', 'enduring', 'visual', 'images', 'great', 'Garbo', 'ever', 'recorded', 'film', 'Certainly', 'effort', 'really', 'began', 'Garbo', 'incredible', 'run', 'tragic', 'historical', 'heroines', 'included', 'Anna', 'karenina', 'Camille', 'Conquest', 'featured', 'women', 'doomed', 'love', 'man']",Queen Christina VHS
