If you have ever know a family dealing with a family member that suffers from some sort of disability this movie will ring true.  The character of Evie is heroic but in the support of her disabled sister she starts to give up more and more of who she is.  The acting is wonderful by all.  The filming is beautiful as is the music.,5,gentle and touching film--dont' miss it,1121040000,"07 11, 2005",2005,379,"['sweetness', 'film', 'rare', 'have', 'ever', 'know', 'family', 'dealing', 'family', 'member', 'sort', 'disability', 'movie', 'will', 'ring', 'true', 'character', 'Evie', 'heroic', 'support', 'disabled', 'sister', 'give', 'up', 'more', 'more', 'who', 'acting', 'wonderful', 'filming', 'beautiful', 'music']",N/A
905288,AQ8DU6XVA3USJ,B0009GX1EW,"Alejandra Vernon ""artist & illustrator""","[9, 12]","""Admissions"" is a complex story of a mother and 2 daughters, where the poem of a caged bird is a central theme, and applies to all 3, in different ways. The mother, Martha, is brilliantly played by Amy Madigan, a woman whose life has been damaged by the guilt of seeing her daughter Emily fall, causing brain damage.  Emily, who is 20, is known as a savant; she can recite anything that is read to her, but cannot do anything to care for herself. Her younger sister Evie writes poetry, and allows everyone to think that Emily is the author. This deception brings about an emotionally catastrophic event, but in the close relationship between the 2 sisters, there is hope for healing.The important message of this film is that though Emily may be mentally  impaired, she is a receptacle for love, and a reflection of it; and in giving that love, Evie gains a depth and character she would perhaps not have had without her sister. Lauren Ambrose as Evie, and Taylor Roberts as Emily are both excellent. The 3 other main characters in the film are: James (Fran Kranz), who has known Evie since childhood, Harry, the mysterious father in the basement, played by John Savage with the right amount of quirkiness, and Christopher Lloyd as Mr. Worthy.The script for ""Admissions"" is by Dawn O'Leary, based on her play, and is unpredictable, as well as interesting. Perhaps the biggest flaw in this film is the sound, which is terrible, and some of the dialogue is not as clear as it should be. Directed by Melissa Painter, this is a very low budget film that is deserving of an audience, especially for those interested in the plight of not only those who need help in society, but of those who give the care, and the love.

The would-be boyfriend instantly saw through the main ruse, why wouldn't everyone else? But then he was the one chasing after her when ""damaged goods"" to describe her would be too generous. Why in the world would he want to subject himself to a person as obviously unbalanced as she was?

It is written from the perspective of a daughter, Evie, and is beautiful.  Themes are adult and inappropriate for children; however, for mature adults, the material is rich, not offensive, and poignant.  This movie is special because although it is written from Evie's perspectice, it is easy to understand her mother's (played by Amy Madigan) perspective, that of her sister, young boyfriend, and even husband.It is rare to find a movie that is beautiful, without gratuitous elements to appeal to our popular culture (and thus sincere), telling and interesting and different story, yet one with which at some level we can all identify.View this movie if you are looking for something thought-provoking, well-done, with spectacular acting and an intelligent plot.  It is an anomaly today, so don't miss it!*****",5,Sweet and beautiful movie about love,1138838400,"02 2, 2006",2006,881,"['*****I', 'enjoyed', 'complex', 'movie', 'family', 'family', 'love', 'written', 'perspective', 'daughter', 'Evie', 'beautiful', 'Themes', 'are', 'adult', 'inappropriate', 'children', 'however', 'mature', 'adults', 'material', 'rich', 'not', 'offensive', 'poignant', 'movie', 'special', 'written', 'Evie', 'perspectice', 'easy', 'understand', 'mother', 'played', 'Amy', 'Madigan', 'perspective', 'sister', 'young', 'boyfriend', 'even', 'husband.It', 'rare', 'find', 'movie', 'beautiful', 'gratuitous', 'elements', 'appeal', 'popular', 'culture', 'thus', 'sincere', 'telling', 'interesting', 'different', 'story', 'one', 'level', 'can', 'identify.View', 'movie', 'are', 'looking', 'something', 'thought-provoking', 'well-done', 'spectacular', 'acting', 'intelligent', 'plot', 'anomaly', 'today', 'so', 'do', ""n't"", 'miss', '*****']",N/A
905292,AB1UMC7SB9D7Z,B0009GX1EW,"PolarisDiB ""dibness""","[5, 7]","We have a character named Evie. Evie just wants to be a good person. She's nice, friendly, smiles often, but is strangely brutally honest. Evie also has a secret. Her idiot-savant sister has been reciting original poetry, which is getting the community excited about the sister writing. Unfortunately, it's Evie's poetry. While their mother starts being happy again and the boy next door shows his interest in Evie, Evie just tries to figure out what she really wants to do.What to keep in mind while watching this movie is who Evie really is. For such a brutally honest person who doesn't mind telling Ivy-league types that she doesn't respect them, it would seem odd that she would be able to pull off a lie. For someone so happy and cheerful, she's quite emotionless when it comes to certain issues. Those aren't character flaws, they're plot development, and they mean a lot more than they at first seem.Mostly this is something of a melodrama: a character lies, the other characters' personalities propel them through drama as relationships are held at risk. But in terms of the writing it's very fresh and bold. The acting helps the writing along very well (maybe the idiot-savant sister could have been played better), and it is a real joy to watch.The directing and the cinematography aren't quite as good. They're acceptable, and Evie's world is wreathed in color and light, which makes for some very beautiful images, but it's not very consistent. It's not really so much of a flaw as a result of a low production value, but within that same value is some genuine storytelling and a real care for the characters. So while it isn't a perfect movie, it's certainly an enjoyable one.--PolarisDiB",4,Well done,1134604800,"12 15, 2005",2005,1702,"['have', 'character', 'named', 'Evie', 'Evie', 'just', 'be', 'good', 'person', 'nice', 'friendly', 'smiles', 'often', 'strangely', 'brutally', 'honest', 'Evie', 'also', 'secret', 'idiot-savant', 'sister', 'been', 'reciting', 'original', 'poetry', 'getting', 'community', 'excited', 'sister', 'writing', 'Unfortunately', 'Evie', 'poetry', 'mother', 'being', 'happy', 'again', 'boy', 'next', 'door', 'interest', 'Evie', 'Evie', 'just', 'figure', 'out', 'what', 'really', 'do.What', 'keep', 'mind', 'watching', 'movie', 'who', 'Evie', 'really', 'such', 'brutally', 'honest', 'person', 'who', ""n't"", 'mind', 'telling', 'Ivy-league', 'types', ""n't"", 'respect', 'would', 'seem', 'would', 'be', 'able', 'pull', 'off', 'lie', 'someone', 'so', 'happy', 'cheerful', 'quite', 'emotionless', 'when', 'certain', 'issues', 'are', ""n't"", 'character', 'flaws', ""'re"", 'plot', 'development', 'mean', 'lot', 'more', 'first', 'seem.Mostly', 'something', 'melodrama', 'character', 'other', 'characters', 'personalities', 'propel', 'through', 'drama', 'relationships', 'are', 'held', 'risk', 'terms', 'writing', 'very', 'fresh', 'bold', 'acting', 'writing', 'very', 'well', 'maybe', 'idiot-savant', 'sister', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'played', 'better', 'real', 'joy', 'watch.The', 'directing', 'cinematography', 'are', ""n't"", 'quite', 'as', 'good', ""'re"", 'acceptable', 'Evie', 'world', 'wreathed', 'color', 'light', 'very', 'beautiful', 'images', 'not', 'very', 'consistent', 'not', 'really', 'so', 'much', 'flaw', 'result', 'low', 'production', 'value', 'same', 'value', 'genuine', 'storytelling', 'real', 'care', 'characters', 'So', ""n't"", 'perfect', 'movie', 'certainly', 'enjoyable', 'one.', 'PolarisDiB']",N/A
