Actually, it was in two parts which provided a refreshing break. The subject was a body found in an underground ice house. The mystery was whodunit. The likely suspects were all involved to some degree as they were seemingly living as a lesbian threesome and scorned by the local villagers. The story unfolded with all sorts of twists and turns, new developments, and enlightening forensic evidence that was only forthcoming at critical times in the story. There was a bit of romance between the suspect and investigating detective that made for an interesting story by itself.

2246,A2TXR85WQLE32N,0764002465,D. S. Thurlow,"[0, 0]","""The Ice House"" is a surprising good television murder mystery from the BBC.  It features very solid performances by Corin Redgrave and a young Daniel Craig as Inspector Walsh and Detective Sergeant McLoughlin, assigned to investigate the mystery of a dead body found in a disused ice house at Streech Grange.  The Grange is inhabited by a Mrs. Maybury, whose husband mysteriously went missing nine years previously.  Inspector Walsh immediately suspects the body is that the missing David Maybury, whom he further suspects was murdered by his wife.However, nothing in this three hour crime drama is simple.  Not the identifying of the body, nor the cause of death, nor how it came to be in the icehouse, nor especially, who done it.  The movie, based on a novel by Minette Walters, manages to make a suspect out of practically the entire cast, including the nearby villagers.  The solution will be a while in coming, and may surprise all but the most acute viewers.  Along the way, Daniel Craig is quietly compelling as a dutiful Scottish cop with a dying marriage, an alcohol problem, and an unexpected attraction to one of the suspects.

The police are called and an investigation is intensely focused on Phoebe as she was the suspected murderer of her missing husband 10 years ago.The village people hate the women living in the mansion located on Streech Grange because they are all lesbians (The village rumor) and it is believed that Phoebe got away with murder.

2256,A27H9DOUGY9FOS,0764002465,"K. Harris ""Film aficionado""","[55, 56]","One of the primary selling points to the 1997 British two-parter ""The Ice House"" is to enjoy a younger, and distinctly less famous, Daniel Craig. Craig plays a detective who can be characterized as intense, brusque, and oftentimes downright hostile. It's a strong performance and one that grows more interesting, more nuanced, and much softer (but still with edge) as this mystery unravels. I mention Craig upfront as the entire marketing campaign for this DVD release hinges on his popularity. Just look at the cover--nothing but Craig! While Craig is compelling, though, it would be unjust to claim that this production belongs to him alone. In fact, ""The Ice House"" is a true ensemble piece with a number of actors turning in stellar work. The DVD menu has the two parts listed separately as well as a feature with the source novel author Minette Walters.""The Ice House"" begins with the discovery of a body on the isolated estate inhabited by a controversial trio of women. Penny Downie plays the central figure whose husband disappeared under mysterious circumstances ten years prior, and this new development (in the ice house, of course) seems to unsettle her greatly. Her friends and tenants are played by Frances Barber and Kitty Aldridge. The ladies have built a fortress around themselves since the accusations of many years ago, and their aloofness has caused rampant speculation and rumors to spread throughout the town. As police descend on their domicile, the ladies are met with much suspicion and hostility. The DCI in charge of the case (Corin Redgrave) obstinately refuses to consider any possibility that isn't linked to past events. And his hot-headed Detective Superintendent (Craig) seems fully onboard. But as the investigation intensifies, it becomes unclear just who the victim is and just what secrets everyone is hiding. Does the body have anything to do with an abusive husband gone missing? Craig starts to get a little too close, from a professional standpoint, but seems to be the only one capable of getting to the heart of the many buried secrets this clan holds close.At heart, ""The Ice House"" is really a chamber piece. Most of the action transpires in the estate house and much of it is grandly dramatic. At first, I found some of these theatrics played a little too big and this is what gave the miniseries a gothic feel. The townsfolk are represented by a brood of over-the-top and vicious villagers who approach the situation as if they are tracking down Frankenstein with pitchforks and torches. And that's not much of an exaggeration! But as the show progresses, the twisty plot and unexpected alliances take center stage. This is supremely entertaining, if not always perfect. There are plenty of false leads and red herrings, but before all is said and done--we will discover what happened in both the past and the present.Craig, as I said, is terrific here. His character gets increasingly more complex and interesting, and he brings a lot of dimension to this thawing. Downie is great too, jittery but strong--a mother lion trying to hang on to sanity. A very young James D'Arcy is on-hand as her son and has some memorable moments, including the movie's most intense scene. But, for me, it is Aldridge that requires special mention. Jaded and cynical, she is an excellent counterpoint for the brash Craig. Their interactions are the heart of ""The Ice House"" and are incredibly strong and interesting. In the end, I don't know that I was particularly surprised or overwhelmed with the screenplay's revelations. But I'm not sure it matters too much. Well made and extremely well acted, this is an easy recommendation especially for those that like British mystery.

The novel won the Crime Writers Association Award for Best First Novel and also the John Creasey Award for Best Debut in 1992. The TV adaptation is a co-production between the BBC and WGBH Boston in association with Showcase Canada. This TV adaptation was screened back in 1996 and is finally available on DVD here in the United States.The story reminded me a little of The Midsomer Murders crime series but with darker, more menacing undertones. The story begins with the discovery of a badly decomposed corpse in a desolate and forgotten ice house. The ice house is part of the grounds of a large estate called Streech Grange, owned by Phoebe Maybury (Penny Downie). Ten years earlier, Phoebe's despised husband David had gone missing and Phoebe was the prime suspect in the case. The police at the time suspected Phoebe of murdering her husband and had even dug up the grounds in the hope of finding David's remains but to no avail.Now that a corpse has turned up, the question is - who is the dead person? Is it David, and if so, did Phoebe kill him? Or is the victim someone else? Enter Chief Inspector George Walsh (Corin Redgrave) and his DS, Andy McLoughlin (a younger Daniel Craig). DCI Walsh has an axe to grind with Phoebe, long suspecting her of covering up her husband's murder and is out to prove her guilt. DS McLoughlin on the other hand, goes through the motions as he deals with the collapse of his own personal life.Soon enough though, McLoughlin gets deeply entrenched in the case as he finds there's much more going on under the surface. Phoebe now lives at the Grange with two other lady friends, Diana Goode (Frances Barber) and Anne Cattrell (Kitty Aldridge) and there's allusions to the ladies' sexuality, in terms of their proclivity for the female sex. As the investigation goes deeper, it becomes obvious that the three women are concealing something, but what exactly? Even Phoebe's two children, Jane and Jonathan who have been away, appear to be hiding something as are the servants.The plot is slow to develop but this is a character-driven drama and every dialogue appears to be important. The interactions between Andy McLoughlin and Anne are especially interesting to watch as it soon becomes evident that McLoughlin and Anne are drawn to each other, even as both realize the risks involved. Daniel Craig is compelling in his role and proves even then that he can be a great character actor. The rest of the ensemble cast also does a great job.This is a story of secrets, romance, the power of gossip to destroy and corrupt, and of revenge most deadly. Those seeking fast and cheap thrills will not find anything to entertain here, but those who enjoy well-developed characters and a tightly woven plot will find themselves engaged.
