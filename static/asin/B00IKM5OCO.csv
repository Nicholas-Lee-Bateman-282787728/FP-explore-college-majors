This movie didn't ring true for me, but it might for others. I didn't like the setups, where &#34;Joe&#34; becomes the recalcitrant hero, pushed in to acts of moral courage he doesn't want to face. I tried to watch it all the way through. The story/director went for &#34;long feels,&#34; meaning, take the slow shot of the guy getting up, falling asleep in an empty life, without meaning, indulging in meaningless gratification, in other words the kind of life that many live. But this didn't add up to much, sort of like putting up a canvas without really putting real color on it. And it got boring. Joe is drifting, day to day. Yeah, so what? The term &#34;paying attention&#34; for me, really does mean that. If something of real value doesn't happen within the first ten minutes of the movie and by &#34;real value,&#34; I mean either powerfully truthful acting, incisive dialogue or driving plot development, my attention wanders. No matter if the fabric of the story is the heartless truth of life unchained, or unredeemed. It's a bleak canvas that doesn't shine much light. Couldn't make myself watch the whole thing.

1694501,ANCOMAI0I7LVG,B00IKM5OCO,Andrew Ellington,"[6, 9]","Nicolas Cage&#8217;s name has been a real deterrent for me when it comes to movies over the past few years.  I honestly actively avoid anything with his name attached.  I can&#8217;t honestly say that, until &#8216;The Croods&#8217; last year, I had not seen a Nicolas Cage film since &#8216;World Trade Center&#8217; in 2006.  In looking over his filmography, it looks like I didn&#8217;t miss much at all.  Now, when &#8216;Joe&#8217; was announced I was intrigued because of two things.  First, David Gordon Green, while not a director I adore, has a pretty interesting filmography.  He has a unique style of direction, earthy and honest, and he likes to build on very human themes.  Second, and possibly more intriguing, was that it was staring (or co-staring) young Tye Sheridan.  Now I had just seen &#8216;Mud&#8217;, where Sheridan completely stole the show and cemented himself as one to watch.  I couldn&#8217;t wait to see him sink his teeth into something else.But then there was Cage&#8217;s name at the top of the poster, and I hesitated.I&#8217;m glad that the hesitation was brief, because while &#8216;Joe&#8217; is not a perfect film, it is a very good one and offers Cage&#8217;s best performance since he won an Oscar, and one that completely strips him of every hammy, overbearing tick he has created as an actor and forces him to live outside of his persona and create something very intimate, very controlled and human.But the film still belongs to Tye Sheridan.&#8216;Joe&#8217;, much like &#8216;Mud&#8217;, gives us a glimpse at life in the poor, destitute south.  It also introduces us to families with real internal problems and lonesome men carrying baggage.  In fact, &#8216;Joe&#8217; feels an awful lot like &#8216;Mud&#8217;, just a little less focused.  While the film itself is anchored by the two leads, the film&#8217;s splintered supporting characters either lack depth needed to make them feel important, or they tack on some clich&eacute;d depth that makes them feel unauthentic.&#8216;Joe&#8217; tells us the story of two troubled individuals.  First, you have Joe.  Nearing 50, Joe has spent a decent amount of time behind bars and is forced to keep his head low and walk the other way for fear his drinking and his temper will get the better of him once again.  Gary also has to learn to keep his head low, for fear that his alcoholic father won&#8217;t beat him for raising it.  Gary, intent on taking care of his mother and sister, who have been neglected and abused by his wandering drunk of a father, takes up a job working for Joe.  Joe takes a liking to Gary and finds himself invested in him and his life and working towards breaking him away from his father and helping him built his own stability.  Sadly, the people in both of their lives (or the people that loiter around it) are intent on breaking both of them down.For me, there are a few things that don&#8217;t work about &#8216;Joe&#8217;.  First, Joe&#8217;s own relationship with the law feels a tad redundant and not fully fleshed out.  He&#8217;s harassed by cops from time to time, and those scenes in particular feel unnecessary and distracting.  Joe&#8217;s backstory needed a little more time too.  We get fleeting mentions of his past, including children and grandchildren, but they are mentioned and then forgotten, and while this could be the point, it almost felt like an unnecessary diversion.  My biggest issue though comes in the form of the film&#8217;s obligatory villain, Willie-Russell.  We don&#8217;t see it, but apparently he got into it with Joe and so he hates him.  Then he gets into it with Gary (we see that altercation) and so he hates him too.  While this vendetta may work for the film&#8217;s finale (although it wasn&#8217;t entirely necessary) it is the character himself that doesn&#8217;t quite work.  He just feels corny and ridiculous (especially his whole &#8220;I went through a windshield&#8221; line that he utters a few times).  He&#8217;s just a dumb villain and with Gary&#8217;s father being the film&#8217;s chief antagonist, and a very successful one, I just can&#8217;t see why Willie-Russell wasn&#8217;t cut from the script.Other than this though, I really liked this one a lot.  The final few scenes brought this repulsive thrill factor (my stomach was on the floor) that brought the film somewhere instead of leaving it as an antii-climactic character study.  But really, it is the performances by Cage and Sheridan that anchor this film.  Gary Poulter (who was actually a real homeless man found by Green and offered the role) is also exceptional here.  He&#8217;s truly convincing, to the point where I have a feeling he was pretty much playing an exaggerated version of himself.  It&#8217;s a shame he died shortly after filming.Cage, more reserved and internal than I&#8217;ve EVER seen him, is soulful and honest here, filling in the blanks left by the script and making Joe feel real from head to toe.  His mannerisms are all expressive and yet never overwrought.  He even handles his bigger, louder scenes with this depth I haven&#8217;t seen from him in years.  But, this is Sheridan&#8217;s place to shine, and he does so with so much promise that I&#8217;m spellbound.  He anchors this movie with such realism.  He lives and breathes this character.  The childish traits help establish an honest age that is prematurely aged by circumstance.  You believe every outburst, every solemn retraction, every earnest plea.  You can feel his trembling, his brooding, his observing and you can see every ounce of &#8216;performance&#8217; leave him while he soaks in the atmosphere created by his character.He&#8217;s one to watch, for sure!So, I can say that despite my few reservations, I highly recommend &#8216;Joe&#8217;.  It does feel like a copycat of sorts to &#8216;Mud&#8217;, carrying very similar themes and characters and atmosphere, and &#8216;Mud&#8217; was better thought out overall, but &#8216;Joe&#8217; does have its own personality that deserves your attention.",4,"So, we&#8217;re on a first name basis now?",1399507200,"05 8, 2014",2014,6044,"['Nicolas', 'Cage', '8217', 's', 'name', 'been', 'real',

In fact, just about everybody in the movie was drinking, smoking, or high in nearly every scene --very one-dimensional plot line.  Oh, and it is a very predictable movie... no twists or turns or surprises.  And, all the characters are so much alike; by this I mean that they are all pretty shady, sleazy, trashy, violent, disrespectful, uneducated, etc., which made the movie a bit boring.  Here is a spoiler alert... I think also that I would have named the movie something to do with the bridges, something like, &#34;Mud Creek Bridge&#34; since the two very poignant scenes occur at both the start and end of the movie on the same bridge.  I also would have stopped the movie on the bridge... the final scene could have been pretty cool with some sort of soliloquy or great realization by the old guy... or maybe the old guy has a final fight with Joe.  Or, maybe the old guy goes off the bridge lands in the creek bed and picks up the gun that was originally thrown off the bridge... he fires back up and kills Joe... that would have been surprising.

1694504,A2EO4O7D7BA2K8,B00IKM5OCO,Blood,"[1, 2]","Nicolas Cage, though he's had some sizable ups and downs in his career, is one of the strongest dramatic actors living today. Mostly known for his breakthrough performances in the 90's like in ""Leaving Las Vegas"" and ""Face/Off"" he always seems to have an undeniable connection with every role he takes on, and that's one of the many reasons why I think so highly of him. He may take a film on just for the paycheck every now and then but people have to remember that acting is a job, and he is one of the best at balancing passion projects with his need to pay the bills. Less concerned with the latter, he most recently joined up with director David Gordon Green to give us the authentic new drama ""Joe"".Set in the backwoods of Mississippi, it tells the story of our title character (Cage), the kind-hearted supervisor of a work crew of tree poisoners who are contaminating old ones to make room for the new. When a fifteen year old drifter named Gary stumbles upon them (played by ""Mud"" star Tye Sheridan) and promptly asks for work, it isn't a surprise that Joe agrees. With Gary dealing with an abusive father, we see Joe try to steer him on the right path, and simultaneously become a role model that Gary desperately needs.With a slow-building, yet touching, relationship at the center, the movie doesn't miss a beat.

There aren't enough superlatives for Nicolas Cage as the flawed landscaper with the checkered past whose personal demons work hand-in-hand with his strengths.  In lesser hands the character could have been overplayed but Cage delivers a nuanced piece of work to remember.  Tye Sheridan builds on his superlatives from last year's ""Mud"" as a teenager with a less than ideal home life.  I was particularly impressed with Gary Poulter as Sheridan's drunken no-account father.  You think that every way to spell evil has been assayed on film but Poulter negates that assumption.  My problem with the film is it seemed derivative like an updating of ""Sling Blade"" .  It felt like a Sundance film festival idea of what the South is like.  Somebody in Hollywood has the impression that the Red States have poverty equivalent to that of a Third World nation.  Also at times the images in the film were very dark.

1694512,A1K3SFTY71SH6Q,B00IKM5OCO,D. Holmes,"[0, 1]","Directed by David Gordon Green, Joe opens with a teenage son chastising his alcoholic father.  The decrepit patriarch has once again misbehaved and brought trouble to the doorstep of himself and his family, forcing them to drift to another town.  The father hits his son and teeters into the distance; there, a group of men emerge and beat him.  The son leaves the scene as the sound of landed blows echo.  This grim scene sets the stage for the overall film, a heavy Southern-Gothic meditation on failure, family, and masculinity.The aforementioned son is played by Tye Sheridan, who, between this film, The Tree of Life, and last year's Mud, has mastered the art of playing Southern lads on the verge of transitioning from earnest childhood to hardened knowledge of the adult world and its perils.  The bastard of a father is played by the late Gary Poulter, a real-life bipolar drifter and former G.I. cast on the street.  Poulter received a terminal cancer diagnosis shortly after the end of the production and later drowned in a small pool of water, inebriated.  (This knowledge only intensifies the impact of a brutal, lived-in nonprofessional performance.)  And the great Nicolas Cage delivers one of his most rewarding performances as the title character, an introverted ex-convict who heads a tree-poisoning outfit and becomes an improbable mentor to the Sheridan character.Green, who here laces the grand visual poetry of his debut George Washington with arsenic and old-fashioned suspense, gives the central trio of characters time and space to reveal themselves, and they emerge as flesh-and-blood characters who are at the same time almost mythological in their sunburned, forgotten-by-society-at-large melancholy.  Cage, always existing on the line separating the A-list movie stars from the wild-eyed character actors, is the perfect choice to play a man whose day-to-day existence in an exercise in extreme self-control.  Joe is a bit of a bastard, and he has a fire inside him, yet he is also tender and desperate to be the best version of himself given the circumstances of his existence.  It is a delight to see Cage portray this internal conflict.  I am not sure any other high-profile celebrity performer could do it so well.  The film in general is highly entertaining and involving, however foreboding and profane.  There are points which honestly invite a reaction of, &#34;Christ, can they shoehorn one more filthy, larger-than-life, mean-spirited character into this crazy film?,&#34; but it is always a fleeting response because the characters and their hard-edged arcs are just too riveting to turn away from.",5,Nicolas Cage is electrifying in this foreboding Southern-Gothic yarn,1397347200,"04 13, 2014",2014,2637,"['Directed', 'David', 'Gordon', 'Green', 'Joe', 'teenage', 'son', 'chastising', 'alcoholic', 'father', 'decrepit', 'patriarch', 'once', 'again', 'misbehaved', 'brought', 'trouble', 'doorstep', 'family', 'forcing', 'drift', 'town', 'father', 'son', 'teeters', 'distance', 'there', 'group', 'men', 'emerge', 'beat', 'son', 'scene', 'sound', 'landed', 'blows', 'echo', 'grim', 'scene', 'stage', 'overall', 'film', 'heavy', 'Southern-Gothic', 'meditation', 'failure', 'family', 'masculinity.The', 'aforementioned', 'son', 'played', 'Tye', 'Sheridan', 'who', 'film', 'Tree', 'Life', 'last', 'year', 'Mud', 'mastered', 'art', 'playing', 'Southern', 'lads', 'verge', 'transitioning', 'earnest', 'childhood', 'hardened', 'knowledge', 'adult', 'world', 'perils', 'bastard', 'father', 'played', 'late', 'Gary', 'Poulter', 'real-life', 'bipolar', 'drifter', 'former', 'G.I', 'cast', 'street', 'Poulter', 'received', 'terminal', 'cancer', 'diagnosis', 'shortly', 'end', 'production', 'later', 'drowned', 'small', 'pool', 'water', 'inebriated', 'knowledge', 'only', 'impact', 'brutal', 'lived-in', 'nonprofessional', 'performance', 'great', 'Nicolas', 'Cage', 'one', 'most', 'rewarding', 'performances', 'title', 'character', 'introverted', 'ex-convict', 'who', 'tree-poisoning', 'outfit', 'improbable', 'mentor', 'Sheridan', 'character.Green', 'who', 'here', 'grand', 'visual', 'poetry', 'debut', 'George', 'Washington', 'arsenic', 'old-fashioned', 'suspense', 'central', 'trio', 'characters', 'time', 'space', 'reveal', 'emerge', 'flesh-and-blood', 'characters', 'who', 'are', 'same', 'time', 'almost', 'mythological', 'sunburned', 'forgotten-by-society-at-large', 'melancholy', 'Cage', 'always', 'existing', 'line', 'separating', 'A-list', 'movie', 'stars', 'wild-eyed', 'character', 'actors', 'perfect', 'choice', 'play', 'man', 'day-to-day', 'existence', 'exercise', 'extreme', 'self-control', 'Joe', 'bit', 'bastard', 'fire', 'yet', 'also', 'tender', 'desperate', 'be', 'best', 'version', 'given', 'circumstances', 'existence', 'delight', 'see', 'Cage', 'portray', 'internal', 'conflict', 'am', 'not', 'sure', 'other', 'high-profile', 'celebrity', 'performer', 'could', 'do', 'so', 'well', 'film', 'general', 'highly', 'entertaining', 'involving', 'however', 'foreboding', 'profane', 'are', 'points', 'honestly', 'invite', 'reaction', '34', 'Christ', 'can', 'shoehorn', 'one', 'more', 'filthy', 'larger-than-life', 'mean-spirited', 'character', 'crazy', 'film', '34', 'always', 'fleeting', 'response', 'characters', 'hard-edged', 'arcs', 'are', 'just', 'too', 'riveting', 'turn', 'away']",N/A

Tye Sheridan is similarly good as Gary, a stalwart 15-year-old with an abusive alcoholic father who comes to work for Joe and unexpectedly finds a surrogate father in him. There is an interesting alter-ego effect between Joe and Gary's father, Wade ""G-Daawg,"" who, interestingly, was convincingly played by Gary Poulter, a homeless man who died on the streets of Austin a couple of months after JOE's filming was complete.There have been a lot of comments about how depressing and ""slow"" JOE is, and it's definitely not the thing to see if you're in the mood for something fun and uplifting or something with tons of thrills and action. It's a slow-burner with a quietly hypnotic plot and a mildly explosive--and very moving--ending. While it's not quite on the level of 1996's Oscar-winningSling Blade, it's reminiscent of that film, with a similarly believable anti-hero as its central character.

In Austin, Texas he found a street person - Gary Poulter - who plays a significant role in this film, Two months after the film was completed Pouter was found dead on the streets of Austin. That sets a tone for the film - very dark, little in the way of redemptive force, but an opportunity for Nicholas Cage and Tye Sheridan to prove their acting chops.Joe Ransom (Nicholas Cage) drops the bottles as quickly as he burned his life. Joe is perhaps irresponsible, but is no less a hard worker. He manages a work team of black men who admire him in a forest where his task is to poison trees so that an outside contractor and come in and rid the woods of bad trees and plant good ones (there is a fine line of parallel to the story here). Joe encounters Gary (Tye Sheridan), a boy of 15 years, and his father, Wade aka G-Daawg  (Gary Poulter), an alcoholic good-for-nothing. For Gary, all is not lost; there is still time for him to seek the right path, to escape from the control of damaging his father yet still support his mute sister and pathetic helpless mother. Joe struggles with his past as an ex-con, his alcoholism, his dependency on female sex workers, and attempting of manage his short-fused anger that gets him into trouble all too frequently. Joe takes on Gary, gives him work, lets him use his truck, and in general protects Gary from harm. A town bully/creep Willie-Russell (Ronnie Gene Blevins) has endured abuse from Joe and is stalking him and eventually Gary and G-Dwaag in a revenge twist. How Joe deals with coping with redemption or ruin plays out in the final scenes of this film.The film is unrelentingly dark, both in camera action and in storyline. The only thing that keeps is afloat is the sensitivity of the bilaterally desperately needy relationship between Cage and Sheridan - and they make us care about them.

1694534,A2DAHERP7HYJGO,B00IKM5OCO,Mark Turner,"[2, 3]","When viewing a movie most people subconsciously realize that the film is only good if the sum of all parts comes together. A great performance can be missed when the cinematography is lousy. A bad director or screenwriter can take a wonderful story and butcher it to make the movie intolerable. If all parts are bad then the turkey and rotten tomato awards raise their heads. Knowing that a single part is good doesn't make up for the bad. Such is the case with JOE.Nicolas Cage stars as Joe, a foreman for a group that kills trees to be cut down by a lumber company. He works hard, plays hard, drinks hard, treats his crew fair, but in the end is an honorable working stiff. Into his world comes Gary (Ty Sheridan).Gary's family is far from good. His father is a raging alcoholic prone to violence and anything for a drink. The family is a set of drifters moving from town to town, living in abandoned homes as a way to have a roof over their heads. Gary approaches Joe hoping for work. Joe gives him that opportunity and Gary proves he can hang in with the rest of them. When he brings his father along to work as well we see the man has no interest in actual work and would rather just take the money from his son who earned it.Joe takes a liking to the boy but avoids getting in the middle of a confrontation. He has a past that involved jail time and a hair trigger temper that explodes later in the film. Joe might be able to keep that anger in check but the bigger the bond he forms with Gary, the more likely we'll see it erupt before the end of the film.But there are other things in Joe's life that cause him trouble as well. Another man in town with a scarred face continues to plague Joe. We first see him following Joe and next see him shoot him with no clue what is going on. Later we find out Joe hit him in front of a bar full of patrons a few days earlier. This same character runs into Gary and his father on a backwoods bridge, insults Gary's family and ends up beat down by him. This sets the stage for the final confrontation of the film, a sequence that provides both Joe and Gary with choices that will affect both of their lives forever.As the movie progresses it seems more intent of showing us glimpses of the characters instead of presenting a story. We see Joe visit a local whorehouse. We see him take in a young woman; I'm still not sure who she was or how they knew one another. That's the problem with much of the film. So many bits and pieces are there but we have no way of knowing why or how. In watching the extras I learned more about what I just watched than I did while watching it.The movie feels disjointed, as if something were missing. Not just missing but parts missing as if sequences were cut from here and there to make the film fit a time slot while at the same time sacrificing story. We see a car pull up beside Joe and the woman look at him and then glance away as if she knew him. I had no clue until watching the extras that this woman was Joe's ex-wife. A sequence having the two of them meet at the post office was cut from the final film which would have let us know that. Instead we just see some stranger looking at Joe and then looking away.The majority of the film feels like this. Thinking back I don't think a clear line of storytelling runs until perhaps the last 30 minutes of the film. Then for me, as a lover of books and writing, comes the unforgivable sin. The screenwriter talks about how he changed the ending of the book because that's what he thought the writer was going for. What that means is &#34;I love the source material but I think I can make it better&#34;. They do this a lot in film and it rarely is the case. Instead what could have been a good, solid story is suddenly put together piecemeal so that you're left wondering what the story actually was.Cage does a fine job as Joe turning in another great performance as he is prone to do. The fact that the putting together of the film makes his character seem to have a split personality doesn't help, but he shines through anyway. Sheridan, an up and coming young actor on the rise, finds himself in that same boat. It was hard to judge how well he did due to the helter skelter storyline.I've read some review of this film that praised Cage and talked about how great this movie was. While watching it all I could do was bring up the time stamp to see how much longer it was going to be till it ended. For me those who praised it did so because of the usual reasons. It portrayed a blue collar worker who was anti-authority so if you have that mind set you love him. It showed a backwoods world that was incredibly stereotypical of Hollywood's belief in what the world looks like between LA and NY. What would make a great movie is if those making them actually lived in that part of the country and saw it was nothing like they depict except in the most obscure corners.In the end this movie, though having an actual end, left more questions than it offered answers. It told a story that rambled over too many areas without focusing on one until near the end. It offered a good performance in a bad movie. I can only recommend this to Cage fans. Everyone else might want to look for something else.",2,SOMETHING IS MISSING,1403654400,"06 25, 2014",2014,5235,"['When', 'viewing', 'movie', 'most', 'people', 'subconsciously', 'realize', 'film',

1694536,AAY1NV7ZXMZ8H,B00IKM5OCO,Matthew Anderson,"[7, 10]","After a slew of recent films which seemed to be mostly just for the paycheck, Cage picked a winner this time. I'm reminded of some of his roles from the '80's and early '90's, Wild at Heart, Leaving Las Vegas, and Red Rock West to name a few. Most of the supporting cast are no name actors who appear unaware that they're on camera. This is a good thing. One of the actors you may recognize is Tye Sheridan. He played one of the sons in Tree of Life and played the main character in Mud. Either Tye is really smart or his agent is because in my opinion this kid only picks roles that are just right for him in movies that have real substance.

I found Joe to be the most realistic and symbolic of the three.  I couldn't quite fathom the premise of a son driving his demented father cross country to redeem a fake winning lottery ticket (Nebraska), as I myself can only humor a crazy person for about an hour, and the boat in the tree just didn't do it for me in Mud.  In Joe, the concept of an alcoholic attempting to escape his past but begin tugged and....I won't tell the ending...seems very realistic.  And the notion that they poison the trees so that the trees can be cut down and replaced by higher grade trees is to me and underlying theme of the bottom fishing life that these characters lead (they are not glamorous enough to be loggers, they are &#34;pre-loggers&#34;).  The fact that the boy is drawn from his alcoholic, abusive father to Cage, who frankly isn't an angel himself, seems frankly very real to me - any port in a storm as we used to say.

Cage plays an ex-con who still has issues with his anger but is a good, decent person struggling to make ends meet. Joe hires 15 year old Gary (Tye Sheridan)to help with his business of clearing land. Gary comes from an abusive household and Joe finds himself in the unlikely position of being a role model for the boy and looking out for him. ""Joe"" is a character study focusing on both and their attempt to escape their past and move on with their lives as best they can.If you're looking for a bright, uplifting drama or action film, ""Joe"" is the wrong film to watch. The deliberate pacing of the film allows nice character development and gives us a good sense of the world that Joe and Gary inhabit--one where the difference between redemption or ruin can be one action away.Gary Poulter who plays the abusive father of Gary (Tye Sheridan)died shortly after filming was completed. Poulter gives a convincing and powerful performance drawing on his own experience of homelessness and substance abuse. Poulter was found dead in a homeless camp. It's a sad, tragic end for someone who demonstrated a strong ability as an actor in his only role and his performance is very memorable.Cage gives a powerful performance remding us what a good actor he can be when he works with the right material and avoids the type of the often pointless action films he has made over the last decade. When watching ""Joe"" you'll be reminded that THIS was the actor that won an Oscar for ""Leaving Las Vegas"". It's nice to see him doing something substanial after all this time.Director David Gordon Green (""The Pineapple Express"", ""The Sitter"") takes a detour into stron dramatic material without a hint of the comedy that he has done most recently. Based on the book by the late Larry Brown, Green and his screenwriter Gary Hawkins (Emmy Award winning director of the documentary ""The Rough South of Harry Crews"") do an exceptional job of bringing Brown's novel to the screen.The blu-ray looks extremely good--the film has a deliberately grainy and ""rough"" look to it that compliments the story. Detail looks strong throughout the presentation. The audio isn't all that active in the surround speakers most of the time (except for the few action sequences)but that's to be expected with a film that is primarily dialog and character driven.The special features include a featurette on the author Larry Brown, a making of featurette and two deleted scenes. The final special feature is a commentary track featuring the director, actor Brian D. Mays (he plays Junior in the film) and composer David Wingo.""Joe"" is a sad, powerful (but ultimately somewhat uplifting by the conclusion) film featuring a terrific series of performances. Cage is outstanding. ""Joe"" recalls the character driven dramas of the 1970's and, although the pacing is a bit slack (and the film could have been trimmed by 15 or so minutes), it's largely a successful and thoughtful movie.Recommended.",4,"Dark, gritty drama with terrific performance from Nic Cage",1404518400,"07 5, 2014",2014,3025,"['Nicolas', 'Cage', 'stellar', 'performance', 'title', 'character', 'Joe', 'Cage', 'ex-con', 'who', 'still', 'issues', 'anger', 'good', 'decent', 'person', 'struggling', 'make', 'ends', 'meet', 'Joe', '15', 'year', 'old', 'Gary', 'Tye', 'Sheridan', 'help', 'business', 'clearing', 'land', 'Gary', 'abusive', 'household', 'Joe', 'unlikely', 'position', 'being', 'role', 'model', 'boy', 'looking', 'out', 'Joe', 'character', 'study', 'focusing', 'attempt', 'escape', 'past', 'move', 'lives', 'best', 'can.If', ""'re"", 'looking', 'bright', 'uplifting', 'drama', 'action', 'film', 'Joe', 'wrong', 'film', 'watch', 'deliberate', 'pacing', 'film', 'nice', 'character', 'development', 'good', 'sense', 'world', 'Joe', 'Gary', 'inhabit', 'one', 'where', 'difference', 'redemption', 'ruin', 'can', 'be', 'one', 'action', 'away.Gary', 'Poulter', 'who', 'abusive', 'father', 'Gary', 'Tye', 'Sheridan', 'died', 'shortly', 'filming', 'was', 'completed', 'Poulter', 'convincing', 'powerful', 'performance', 'drawing', 'own', 'experience', 'homelessness', 'substance', 'abuse', 'Poulter', 'was', 'found', 'dead', 'homeless', 'camp', 'sad', 'tragic', 'end', 'someone', 'who', 'demonstrated', 'strong', 'ability', 'actor', 'only', 'role', 'performance', 'very', 'memorable.Cage', 'powerful', 'performance', 'remding', 'what', 'good', 'actor', 'can', 'be', 'when', 'right', 'material', 'avoids', 'type', 'often', 'pointless', 'action', 'films', 'made', 'last', 'decade', 'When', 'watching', 'Joe', ""'ll"", 'be', 'reminded', 'THIS', 'was', 'actor', 'won', 'Oscar', 'Leaving', 'Las', 'Vegas', 'nice', 'see', 'doing', 'something', 'substanial', 'time.Director', 'David', 'Gordon', 'Green', 'Pineapple', 'Express', 'Sitter', 'detour', 'stron', 'dramatic', 'material', 'hint', 'comedy', 'done', 'most', 'recently', 'Based', 'book', 'late', 'Larry', 'Brown', 'Green', 'screenwriter', 'Gary', 'Hawkins', 'Emmy', 'Award', 'winning', 'director', 'documentary', 'Rough', 'South', 'Harry', 'Crews', 'do', 'exceptional', 'job', 'bringing', 'Brown', 'novel', 'screen.The', 'blu-ray', 'looks', 'extremely', 'good', 'film', 'deliberately', 'grainy', 'rough', 'look', 'story', 'Detail', 'strong', 'presentation', 'audio', ""n't"", 'active', 'surround', 'most', 'time', 'few', 'action', 'sequences', 'be', 'expected', 'film', 'primarily', 'dialog', 'character', 'driven.The', 'special', 'features', 'include', 'featurette', 'author', 'Larry', 'Brown', 'making', 'featurette', 'two', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'final', 'special', 'feature', 'commentary', 'track', 'featuring', 'director', 'actor', 'Brian', 'D.', 'Mays', 'Junior', 'film', 'composer', 'David', 'Wingo', 'Joe', 'sad', 'powerful', 'ultimately', 'somewhat', 'uplifting', 'conclusion', 'film', 'featuring', 'terrific', 'series', 'performances', 'Cage', 'outstanding', 'Joe', 'character', 'driven', 'dramas', '1970', 'pacing', 'bit', 'slack', 'film', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'trimmed', '15', 'so', 'minutes', 'largely', 'successful', 'thoughtful', 'movie.Recommended']",N/A
