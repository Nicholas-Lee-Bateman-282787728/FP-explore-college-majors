He was only 19 when he fathered our heroine and bailed out on her mother because his parents wanted him to go to college.* Rosario Dawson (&#34;Zookeeper&#34;) is the reason our gal ran away: Mom is a drug addict and a prostitute...reason enough, don't you think? Her actions are chilling; our screening audience gasped during one scene.* James Earl Jones (&#34;Jack and the Beanstalk&#34; voice) brings hope with his role as the white knight who comes galloping into our wounded girl's broken life, insisting that things CAN be better.* Ann Dowd (&#34;Side Effects&#34;) is Kathy, the practical and loving woman who provides that much-needed shelter.This PG-13 story is based on true incidents in the life of a pregnant runaway, with some very welcome photos of the real people during the final credits.

I've worked in some of the most challenging schools in the most poverty-stricken communities in Connecticut -and yeah, we have some real poverty here.I've seen young girls faced with the dilemma Apple faces. In and out of the classroom, I've watched them fight to hold something good and pure in a world full of hardship and strife. These girls are one of the reasons I support our local crisis pregnancy centers.There are a lot of people behaving badly in this movie. Selfish, short-sighted people. People who are angry and resentful over their bad choices and missteps. People who are so hurt by their mistakes that they lash out at people in the most hurtful and hateful ways.

It brings the story, ""based on true events"" we are reminded at the beginning, of 16 yr. old Agnes ""Apple"" Bailey (played by Vanessa Hudgens), who in the first scene of the movie is running away from June, her drug-abusing mom (played by Rosario Dawson) and her mom's boyfriend. She manages to get from New York across to New Jersey and finds her dad, whom she hasn't seen in ages and now turns out to be a stinking rich Wall Street investment banker, married with two young kids. Apple has a hard time fitting in, and on top of that now it turns out that she is pregnant. Her dad suggests she gets an abortion and ""move on with your life"" but Apple resists. At this point we are about 30 min. into the movie but to tell you more would spoil your viewing experience, you'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.Couple of comments: first, this movie was shot in 2011, and has been sitting on the distribution shelf for quite some time. Second, even though we saw Hudgens last year in a very unlike-Disney role in ""Spring Breakers"", you could easily argue that this movie was an even earlier attempt to break out of the Disney image (although on much safer territory). When you first see her, she is almost unrecognizable. I know it took me a few moments to adjust. Third, there are a couple of great performances in here, none more so than from Rosario Dawson in the role of the completely unlikeable mom. James Earl Jones as Father McCarthy has a small role to. He tries to bring some much needed guidance to Apple. At one point, he comments to her: ""being young and pregnant is like being a pinwheel, you just drift as the wind takes you"". Fourth, there are some good music placements in the movie, Lara Del Rey's ""Born To Die"" among them.This movie sat on the shelf for a reason. It is not a great movie, even though it is inspirational and has some good performances. I saw it in the theater last month on its first weekend of wide release, and the screening I saw this at, on a Friday evening, was poorly attended (and I saw at least 2 people leave midway through).

Zwick,"[0, 1]","Written and directed by Ronald Krausse, &#8220;Gimme Shelter&#8221; proves that good intentions and earnestness alone can&#8217;t guarantee the quality of a film.The screenplay is based on the true story of a 16-year-old girl who goes by the name Apple (the talented Vanessa Hudgens) whose life could easily have served as the basis for a  Dickens novel had it been set a century-and-a-half in the past. Born to an abusive, drug-addicted single mother (an uglied-up Rosario Dawson) who wants her daughter around only for the welfare checks she brings in, Apple has been kicked around from one foster home to the next, when she isn&#8217;t trying to re-connect with her uber-rich biological father (Brendan Fraser) or living on the streets, that is.Krausse sure pours on the pathos and the suffering, but the movie as a whole isn&#8216;t as compelling as it should be, partly because, while there is a certain grittiness in the look and feel of the picture, the episodic nature of the tale doesn&#8216;t allow for any real development of the secondary characters, leaving them stereotypical and flat. They simply remain off-screen for too long a time to register much of an impact on the audience. Apple&#8217;s absurdly callous &#8220;step-mother&#8221; (Stephanie Szostak) and a kindly priest (James Earl Jones), who offers the hand of friendship to Apple in her time of greatest need, feel particularly two-dimensional and under-developed. Moreover, the dialogue frequently undercuts the naturalism of the piece by having the characters spell out in words rather than through indirection and action what it is we&#8216;re supposed to be taking away with us from the movie.All those who made &#8220;Gimme Shelter&#8221; definitely had their hearts in the right place, but I think this is one of those instances where a little less fidelity to the actual story and a little more focus might have resulted in a more effective drama.",3,Well-meaning but ultimately pedestrian drama,1400112000,"05 15, 2014",2014,1931,"['Written', 'directed', 'Ronald', 'Krausse', '8220', 'Gim', 'Shelter', '8221', 'good', 'intentions', 'earnestness', 'alone', 'can', '8217', 'guarantee', 'quality', 'film.The', 'screenplay', 'based', 'true', 'story', '16-year-old', 'girl', 'who', 'name', 'Apple', 'talented', 'Vanessa', 'Hudgens', 'life', 'could', 'easily', 'have', 'served', 'basis', 'Dickens', 'novel', 'had', 'been', 'set', 'century-and-a-half', 'past', 'Born', 'abusive', 'drug-addicted', 'single', 'mother', 'uglied-up', 'Rosario', 'Dawson', 'who', 'daughter', 'only', 'welfare', 'Apple', 'been', 'kicked', 'one', 'foster', 'home', 'next', 'when', 'isn', '8217', 'trying', 're-connect', 'uber-rich', 'biological', 'father', 'Brendan', 'Fraser', 'living', 'streets', 'is.Krausse', 'sure', 'pours', 'pathos', 'suffering', 'movie', 'whole', 'isn', '8216', 'as', 'compelling', 'should', 'be', 'partly', 'certain', 'grittiness', 'look', 'feel', 'picture', 'episodic', 'nature', 'tale', 'doesn', '8216', 'allow', 'real', 'development', 'secondary', 'characters', 'leaving', 'stereotypical', 'flat', 'simply', 'remain', 'off-screen', 'too', 'long', 'time', 'register', 'much', 'impact', 'audience', 'Apple', '8217', 'absurdly', 'callous', '8220', '8221', 'Stephanie', 'Szostak', 'kindly', 'priest', 'James', 'Earl', 'Jones', 'who', 'hand', 'friendship', 'Apple', 'time', 'greatest', 'need', 'feel', 'particularly', 'two-dimensional', 'under-developed', 'Moreover', 'dialogue', 'frequently', 'naturalism', 'piece', 'having', 'characters', 'spell', 'out', 'words', 'rather', 'indirection', 'action', 'what', '8216', 're', 'supposed', 'be', 'taking', 'away', 'movie.All', 'who', 'made', '8220', 'Gim', 'Shelter', '8221', 'definitely', 'had', 'hearts', 'right', 'place', 'think', 'one', 'instances', 'where', 'little', 'less', 'fidelity', 'actual', 'story', 'little', 'more', 'focus', 'might', 'have', 'resulted', 'more', 'effective', 'drama']",N/A

However, these kids.....who at times can be feral as &#34;apple&#34; is.....but inside they want to be loved and want a family and want everything that they should have had. Its realistic to find yourself attached to a parent who is out of control and yet the system keeps letting parent thus perpetuating the cycle. The drug dependent mom...is excited Apple is pregnant because &#34;mom&#34; will get all the money as apple is still a minor. It isn't until &#34;apple&#34; begins to speak up for herself that she begins to get away.....it isn't until she is old enough to have other options than the system does she find salvation Yet many do not speak up for themselves. Being in bad places they tend to get love...wherever they can find it. Apple is no different and it is how she find herself pregnant at 16 just like her mother. However....the part where the movie tends to become unrealistic...showing Apple finding a open car (it rarely happens when your truly on the streets) She finds a bit of food in the car, water, and a blanket. Nobody moves the car either. (I was expecting the fairy God Mother to show up.....It also shows her eating out of a trash can.....but of course Apple doesn't get food poisoning. (Another unrealistic side to really living on the streets as a kid.)  Then there is a rich dad. He has been indifferent to Apple for 16 years and suddenly she bursts into his life (pregnant). Why wasn't he paying child support? A Wall Street millionaire??? Really??? Apples step mom is more of the same....a manipulative liar....telling dad that Apple just ran away... However, rich nasty step mom actually abandons this moneyless pregnant teen at the doctors office. Then calls it a &#34;misunderstanding&#34; I will give the movie kudos for the dad telling apple to just &#34;turn the page&#34;. Forget about everything you have been through. I did find parts of the movie good but it was also a movie version of what the truth really is........ when your a teen on the streets. Its is meant to give you the warm fuzzies. Make you feel like there is hope for teens who pick themselves up by the bootstraps and get out of the cesspool of drugs, abuse and poverty. Take it from this reviewer who also did the same....and lived on the streets for several months too at not nearly 13. Nobody has a rich dad....kids like this are the product of their parents environment. What we should be asking ourselves is how we allow crack addict mothers to continue to raise children....with a system that rewards them for having more and also a system that even gives more money if one of their minor girls gets  pregnant.

In order to get off the heap and change her life around, Apple must take the first step and decide to change her life. She leaves her abusive mother (Rosario Dawson) and seeks out the father she never knew (Brendan Fraser). Dad is understanding, willing to help, but is not loving especially when he finds out Apple is with child.Apple wants to have the child against her dad's wishes and through a series of circumstances finds herself in a girl's shelter where she experiences the first love and trust she has ever had in her life.This is perhaps the best film entitled &#34;Gimme Shelter&#34; without Mick Jagger.

After she finds him things don't go as planned. Neither him or his wife think Apple should have the baby so they bring her to a clinic. Knowing that isn't what she wants Apple runs from there and winds up homeless living on the streets and out of garbage until she is taken to a shelter for young pregnant women. Finding that place changes her entire life. After watching the trailer for this I thought I was prepared for how heavy the movie was gonna be. I wasn't. The movie is hard to watch in some parts and knowing that this is based on a true story makes it that much more powerful. The best part and the reason to watch though is Vanessa Hudgens. She so inhabits this character that you forget it's her. She is in a movie with Rosario Dawson, Brendan Fraser and James Earl Jones and they all struggle to keep up with her. The movie does have the feel of Precious and movies like that so it's not one you can watch over and over but it should be viewed at least once if for no other reason then to see Vanessa Hudgens' performance.

1692644,ATB8MP2M9L5PM,B00HW3EJQE,"Transcendental Thomist ""jeb815""","[7, 8]","There are real people out there like Agnes ""Apple"" Bailey, the 16-year old girl who runs away from her abusive mother at the start of the film ""Gimme Shelter,"" only to end up pregnant and homeless on the streets of New York. But Apple, portrayed convincingly by a near-unrecognizable Vanessa Hudgens, is only one highlight of this film.Excellent performances are also found with the sympathetic Father McCarthy (James Earl Jones) and the abusive mother (Rosario Dawson) who influence the direction of Apple's life. And Kathy DiFiore, the compassionate social worker (Ann Dowd) who takes in Apple, is portrayed with great compassion. After trading an abusive marriage for homelessness, the real-life DiFiore founded the ""Several Sources"" homeless shelters for pregnant teens that inspired this little indie film.Bottom line: This movie is the absolute best pro-life film I've ever seen. It's more high-quality that low-budget Protestant stuff like ""October Baby."" It's also more realistic than ""Bella"" since it's based on a true story. Although ""Bella"" is a powerful and moving film, it's also a whimsical fiction, whereas ""Gimme Shelter"" gets added grit from its basis in real life. It is a labor of love.Both ""Bella"" and ""Gimme Shelter"" are Catholic films, but ""Gimme Shelter"" feels more real, more heartfelt, and more immediate to the experience of young people growing up in a world of haves and have-nots.It's also one of the best social justice films I've ever seen, giving an amazingly sharp depiction of teenage homelessness that riveted my theology students when we watched the film together. They are usually pretty immune to any sort of ""care about the world"" message. But this film, maybe because Vanessa Hudgens was in it got to them. ""Gimme Shelter"" has the biting realism of ""Dead Man Walking"" without any of the moral sermonizing.This DVD includes a brilliant transfer with 5.1 audio, deleted scenes with director's commentary, a ""making of"" featurette,and the usual Spanish subtitles.
